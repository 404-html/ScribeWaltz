1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,210
[inaudible].

2
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,790
Kevin, welcome to the Tim
Ferriss show. Thank you.

3
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:21,120
I am excited to be here and for
people who don't know, Kevin,

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,670
allow me to introduce Kevin Systrom at
Kevin on Instagram as an entrepreneur and

5
00:00:26,671 --> 00:00:28,680
cofounder of Instagram.
While at Instagram,

6
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,100
Kevin served as the CEO where he oversaw
the company's vision and strategy and

7
00:00:32,101 --> 00:00:33,120
daily operations.

8
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,470
That is a whole lot which we will
talk about under his leadership.

9
00:00:37,471 --> 00:00:40,530
Instagram grew to over 1 billion users.

10
00:00:40,531 --> 00:00:44,790
That's with a B and launched dozens
of products including video, live,

11
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:47,610
direct messaging and creative
tools, stories and IGT. V.

12
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,200
The company also grew to more than 800
employees with a campus in Menlo Park,

13
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,590
new offices in New York City and a
new headquarters in San Francisco.

14
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:57,360
Prior to founding Instagram,

15
00:00:57,361 --> 00:01:00,600
Kevin graduated from Stanford
University with a BS in management,

16
00:01:00,601 --> 00:01:01,710
science and engineering.

17
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:06,750
He currently lives in San Francisco with
his wife and daughter, where to begin.

18
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,260
So we've spent a little bit of time
together. We have a little bit of time,

19
00:01:10,261 --> 00:01:14,940
fortunately not three minutes on morning
television to explore all sorts of

20
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:15,420
things.

21
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,420
And I thought we could start
with one since you seem to read,

22
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:24,810
not just why a widely but intelligently
and we'll hopefully get into that.

23
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:30,300
Are there any particular books that
you have gifted often to other people?

24
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:34,470
Yeah, totally. Um, of course now
all my friends are having kids.

25
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,030
I give kids books, but, uh,
the one I give people that are,

26
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:42,990
are trying to learn actively
as principles by Ray Daleo. Um,

27
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,960
it's interesting actually
someone gave me the pdf,

28
00:01:45,961 --> 00:01:50,170
it was a pdf before his buck gave me
the pdf and I like skimmed over it.

29
00:01:50,171 --> 00:01:52,440
I was like, Oh, this is pretty
good. And they were like, no,

30
00:01:52,441 --> 00:01:54,700
I seriously think you're gonna love this.
And I,

31
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,630
for some reason I didn't get around
to it for maybe a year and a half.

32
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:01,260
And then I read the actual
book and I was blown away. Uh,

33
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,710
it's both a guide to life,
a guide to business.

34
00:02:04,711 --> 00:02:07,780
And also I think an
insight into, uh, ray and,

35
00:02:07,781 --> 00:02:11,190
and someone who's built an amazing
business. If you guys listening,

36
00:02:11,191 --> 00:02:15,720
don't know what he does. He a runs a hedge
fund called Bridgewater and he's, um,

37
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,750
he's so much more than, you
know, just a finance thinker.

38
00:02:18,751 --> 00:02:20,880
He's also just a brilliant philosopher.

39
00:02:20,881 --> 00:02:25,560
So I give that a lot because I think
it's a, a great guide to life. Yeah.

40
00:02:25,561 --> 00:02:28,440
He's a fascinating read it.
I have, I have actually,

41
00:02:28,441 --> 00:02:33,390
and Ray's been on the show for
those people who were wondering, uh,

42
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:37,200
just just to, how many commas are
involved in Bridgewater capital,

43
00:02:37,201 --> 00:02:40,350
the thing they have $160
billion under management,

44
00:02:40,351 --> 00:02:45,030
something along those lines a little
bit. And, uh, he has a lot of very,

45
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,910
uh,
in some respects,

46
00:02:47,911 --> 00:02:51,240
controversial and unusual
practices within Bridgewater,

47
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:56,270
like recording meetings and saw on and
allowing a all employees to have access

48
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:01,630
to, uh, the, the minutes and
so on. Have such meetings.

49
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:08,140
Are there any other books that
helped you in the early days from an

50
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:11,080
entrepreneurial standpoint
or that you found inspiring?

51
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:16,030
Totally early on. Um, we read, uh,
Mike and I both read the lean startup,

52
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:19,270
I think it's called lean startup method
or lean startup. Can't remember Eric.

53
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:24,180
Eric Reese. Um, and I
remember very early on, um,

54
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,000
I was,

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I went to like one of his like book talks
and I was like one of like 13 people

56
00:03:30,131 --> 00:03:34,000
sitting in this little room in Palo
Alto and I was like a super fan still am

57
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:38,410
actually. And uh, so I don't know
that I've read the entire thing,

58
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:42,450
but the principles from lean
startup I still apply today. Um,

59
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:46,870
one of which is like do the simple thing
first and that was our number one value

60
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:51,070
at a well actually community first was
our number one value at a Instagram.

61
00:03:51,071 --> 00:03:56,071
Number two was do this simple thing first
and still to this day I come back to

62
00:03:58,211 --> 00:04:01,510
that. So if I were reading two books,
I probably read those two books.

63
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:03,720
And if we,
if we,

64
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:07,770
if we look at do the simple thing
first from a practical standpoint,

65
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,240
could you give us an example?

66
00:04:09,241 --> 00:04:13,200
And I love that you brought
up Eric because I remember
also we also have been on

67
00:04:13,201 --> 00:04:16,320
the show. He has not, but I remember
going to start naming people.

68
00:04:16,321 --> 00:04:19,410
He's a great guy. He's a great
guy. I would have them on. Uh,

69
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:21,300
I remember going also too,

70
00:04:21,301 --> 00:04:26,100
I think some hotel conference
room probably in Paulo
Alto when he was initially

71
00:04:26,101 --> 00:04:30,340
testing out the material that later
became the book in these workshops. Yeah.

72
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,980
Yeah. It was like that. Yeah.

73
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,980
Talking about avatars and all
sorts of different things, uh,

74
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,090
doing this simple thing first,
uh,

75
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:42,260
the scope of your
responsibilities at Instagram,

76
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,660
at least reading,

77
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:49,380
even just your bio kind of makes my head
spin to imagine what is involved and

78
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:53,870
how easily distracted you
could become. Uh, what,

79
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:57,840
what are some examples or any examples
of doing the simple thing first?

80
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,100
Putting that into practice? Yeah.
The first thing, the first thing I'll

81
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,710
say about doing the simple thing first is,
um,

82
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:09,650
people love to make their lives more
difficult than it needs to be. It's like,

83
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:14,330
you know, you talk to people who are
saving for retirement and you know,

84
00:05:14,331 --> 00:05:18,080
you don't have to go figure
out a hedging strategy, right?

85
00:05:18,081 --> 00:05:21,140
Like for currencies to
save for retirement.

86
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,280
It turns out just like generally putting
in a mutual fund is not a bad idea.

87
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:30,670
And the returns you get for ever more
complex strategies either in life or

88
00:05:31,311 --> 00:05:35,780
finance, they're like, it's harder
to eke out the incremental value.

89
00:05:35,781 --> 00:05:40,760
And I think what I found in a startup
is when you're small and you're two

90
00:05:40,761 --> 00:05:43,970
people, it's me and Mike were
coding late into the night.

91
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:46,670
Like you don't have time
to make things complex.

92
00:05:46,671 --> 00:05:48,440
You have time to make things work.

93
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:52,430
And what ends up happening
is you over optimize.

94
00:05:52,431 --> 00:05:55,820
So you might think you know
how it's going to break.

95
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:59,950
So you end trying to build a bunch
of things before it breaks and,

96
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,150
and then it breaks in a
different way and you're like,

97
00:06:02,151 --> 00:06:04,910
why did I spend all that time on,
you know,

98
00:06:04,911 --> 00:06:07,850
that fix when actually I needed
to be doing something else.

99
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:11,460
I feel like that that's true in life.
I think it's true in business.

100
00:06:11,461 --> 00:06:16,130
It's true in finance, but so
some examples, um, early on, uh,

101
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,300
maybe the best example at
Instagram was we were a,

102
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:23,720
here's the layman's term version.
We were on one computer,

103
00:06:23,721 --> 00:06:25,760
basically one server and a,

104
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:29,780
we had enough space to store the data
on that one server and Instagram became

105
00:06:29,781 --> 00:06:34,130
popular, right. And it turns out all the
data couldn't fit on one server anymore.

106
00:06:34,131 --> 00:06:36,300
And we were like, this
is a novel problem. Uh,

107
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:40,220
let's figure out how to split it among
two servers or three servers or four.

108
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,660
And instead of just like writing a
single file that said like, Hey, listen,

109
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:49,070
if your user id is, you know, even
your on this server and if it's odd,

110
00:06:49,071 --> 00:06:50,180
you're on that server,

111
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,650
which would have charted the data
across two servers very well in

112
00:06:54,651 --> 00:06:56,480
deterministically.
Uh,

113
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:59,810
what ended up happening was we threw
everything out and we were like,

114
00:06:59,811 --> 00:07:03,550
you know what, let's adopt this crazy
new technology that does auto sharding.

115
00:07:03,551 --> 00:07:05,780
And it was fancy and had all
these bells and whistles.

116
00:07:05,781 --> 00:07:09,230
I won't name it because I don't want
to throw them under the bus. Um,

117
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,600
but we spent,
I don't know,

118
00:07:11,601 --> 00:07:15,920
four months trying to rewrite
our system to be on this new, uh,

119
00:07:15,921 --> 00:07:16,754
database.

120
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,860
And eventually after a crushing a bunch
of times and US having issues with it,

121
00:07:21,861 --> 00:07:24,230
we were about to run out of space
and Mike was like, screw it.

122
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:29,360
And he literally spent maybe two hours
in the afternoon writing that file that

123
00:07:29,361 --> 00:07:32,300
we should have written to begin
with and it all just worked.

124
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,840
So I'm over simplifying things
a little bit for a fact.

125
00:07:35,841 --> 00:07:38,210
But like that's basically what happened.

126
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:42,620
And I still think about that story to
this day in terms of an executive making a

127
00:07:42,621 --> 00:07:47,210
decision with his cofounder about what
to do. Always do the simple thing first.

128
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,560
And it's amazing to me how many people
think the quality of their management

129
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:56,360
they think is judged based
on the complexity of their
decisions or the outcomes.

130
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,250
And it turns out actually the right
thing to do is sometimes the simplest and

131
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:02,690
it's the most effective.

132
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:07,691
So I live that as a value
both in life finance and uh,

133
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,913
and at work as well.

134
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:13,940
So I'm going to rewind the clock
a little bit because I think this,

135
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:16,400
you could do that in editing,
but yes,

136
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,130
we can slice and dice. But this'll be
like watching the movie memento. Okay.

137
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,460
Got It. Uh, it's basically usually what
it's like when I do an interview. Yeah,

138
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,960
exactly. So pretty, pretty
standard protocol. Uh,

139
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,600
I would love to talk about,

140
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:35,130
and we won't spend a ton of time on this
because as we chatted before recording,

141
00:08:35,131 --> 00:08:37,980
I think you've talked about the
origins story of Instagram a lot,

142
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:40,350
but for people who don't have any context,

143
00:08:40,351 --> 00:08:43,080
I think it's worth diving
into a little bit, uh,

144
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:48,290
doing this simple thing first makes me
think of a common problem that I see in

145
00:08:49,351 --> 00:08:53,070
startups and in software
development of any type really,

146
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:56,190
which is feature creep and these products

147
00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:00,140
that start off with a focus lose focus.
And it,

148
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:05,200
it seems to me that you effectively
did the opposite in some ways for the

149
00:09:06,091 --> 00:09:07,620
creation of Instagram.
Could you,

150
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:12,360
can you give people a little bit of
background on how Instagram came to be and

151
00:09:12,361 --> 00:09:15,600
you can tackle that short version,
medium sized, however you like? Well,

152
00:09:15,601 --> 00:09:19,880
first of all, I'm having to talk about
where Instagram came from. I just, um,

153
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:26,210
it's such an interesting story in my life
and that I've talked about it a bunch

154
00:09:26,551 --> 00:09:26,881
of times,

155
00:09:26,881 --> 00:09:30,300
but I forget that it's actually super
interesting to hear for people who might

156
00:09:30,301 --> 00:09:32,010
have signed up for Instagram
a couple of years ago.

157
00:09:32,011 --> 00:09:34,620
I think it's been around
forever. Right? Um,

158
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,060
but also I think it has
some interesting lesson.

159
00:09:37,061 --> 00:09:40,460
So I'll combine both talking
about the origin story,

160
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,900
but also how we kept it simple.
Um,

161
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:47,370
Instagram came out of one wanting to be
my own boss. I was like, you know what?

162
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:50,580
I want to work for myself.
I want to work on ideas.

163
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:55,320
I really hope I'm going to make
money. Um, and I remember, uh,

164
00:09:55,410 --> 00:10:00,180
telling at the time, my mom, uh, I was
like, Hey, I'm going to go do this thing.

165
00:10:00,181 --> 00:10:03,030
And she was like, what about
health insurance? I was like, oh,

166
00:10:03,031 --> 00:10:07,410
what about health insurance? Like, I
totally forgot. Um, so my point is,

167
00:10:07,411 --> 00:10:09,570
I was a little naive,
but I wanted to do my own thing.

168
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,660
And I had a bunch of different ideas.

169
00:10:12,661 --> 00:10:16,800
One of which was a terrible
idea for a checking APP.
Actually. It wasn't terrible,

170
00:10:16,801 --> 00:10:20,880
but like for at the time there were a
bunch of checking apps and we're sitting

171
00:10:20,881 --> 00:10:25,320
in Austin right now, south by
southwest, you know, zoom back six,

172
00:10:25,321 --> 00:10:29,700
she's seven, eight years ago. It was
all about Gowalla and foursquare. Right.

173
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:33,870
Everyone was all about sure. So I had to
have my version. Um, and it wasn't bad,

174
00:10:33,871 --> 00:10:38,220
but you know, it wasn't good
either. And uh, catching him. Yeah,

175
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:41,640
it was called Bourbon.
Um, and be URBN I still,

176
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:46,270
I think I own the domain name
somewhere. Um, but anyway, we, uh, what,

177
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,410
what happened, I was working
on that. I left my job, um,

178
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:54,300
and I happened to be able to raise money
for it and I'm not sure how or why,

179
00:10:54,301 --> 00:10:58,210
but um, checking apps were all the rage.
So we raised some money. It was, you know,

180
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:02,760
a couple of well known firms in the
valley and I had just enough money to work

181
00:11:02,761 --> 00:11:03,121
on it.

182
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:08,121
And I met my cofounder Mike at the time
and I know I needed a bunch of help

183
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:12,210
cause I'm like, I'm technical
but not like, you know,

184
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,630
I'm not a true engineer in the sense
like I didn't study it formally.

185
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:20,490
So I met Mike and he was one of
the power users of Bourbon and uh,

186
00:11:20,491 --> 00:11:24,870
he was like, yeah, this will be
super fun. So we decided to join up.

187
00:11:24,871 --> 00:11:26,700
We worked on Bourbon for maybe,
I don't know,

188
00:11:26,701 --> 00:11:29,340
three months and it was clear
it wasn't working. Okay.

189
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:33,990
It was like very clear the startup
was going nowhere. And, uh,

190
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:38,640
we decided to pivot and this is where
keeping it simple, um, comes in.

191
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:43,110
We actually got to the idea for Instagram
by taking away features from Bourbon,

192
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,060
not by changing at all.

193
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:49,860
So a bunch of the features of Bourbon.
One you could check in at a place,

194
00:11:49,861 --> 00:11:53,320
but two, you could add a photo of
what you were doing at that place.

195
00:11:53,321 --> 00:11:56,530
So you and I were out to drink somewhere.
I check in at the Bar,

196
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:00,700
I can post a photo of the beer I'm having
or the cocktail or whatever. Right. Um,

197
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,540
and it turns out people kind of liked
the checkins the thought it was pretty

198
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:05,800
lame because it was a me too thing.

199
00:12:05,801 --> 00:12:08,620
But they love showing
people what they were doing.

200
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:13,330
They loved taking a picture of the bar,
the restaurant that whatever. And uh,

201
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:15,310
and we realized to keep it simple,

202
00:12:15,311 --> 00:12:17,860
we were going to have to cut
every other feature of Bourbon,

203
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:22,510
which we did and we just kept the photo
part. How did you decide on that feature?

204
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:26,620
Uh, because we made a list and we asked
ourselves what exists in the world,

205
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:31,630
what sucks? Meaning you look
out in the world and you say,

206
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:37,650
what opportunity is there to fill if stuff
doesn't exist and it's a problem that

207
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:42,550
can be solved. Ak like the experience
sucks, then that's what you should go do.

208
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,290
There were a lot of check in apps.

209
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:47,800
There were a lot of planners and
meet up things in group chat things,

210
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:52,510
but there was no solution
for posting great photos too,

211
00:12:52,511 --> 00:12:56,410
like lots of friends all at once.
So we made the list,

212
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,100
we crossed off the things we thought
were pretty boring or just there was no

213
00:13:00,101 --> 00:13:01,750
opportunity in them.
Um,

214
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:07,030
and we circled the photos thing cause
we saw the confluence of both mobile

215
00:13:07,031 --> 00:13:10,930
phones being pervasive. Like
again, go back in the day.

216
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:12,130
Not everyone had an iPhone,

217
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,420
like maybe the iPhone had been out for
a couple of years at that point in 2007,

218
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:20,320
eight. Right? So, um, we
knew that cameras are,

219
00:13:20,321 --> 00:13:22,330
we're going to be pervasive
in people's pockets,

220
00:13:22,331 --> 00:13:25,350
that people were going to be carrying
these camera phones, you know,

221
00:13:25,351 --> 00:13:26,184
wherever they went.

222
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:31,600
But we didn't know if it would be
successful or not to capitalize on that.

223
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:34,780
But it was the only thing that
looked like a greenfield opportunity.

224
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:37,270
Everything else felt crowded.
That's a different way of saying it.

225
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:41,740
So we got to the idea by cutting
everything away from Bourbon circling,

226
00:13:41,741 --> 00:13:45,010
the one thing that we felt like was the
biggest opportunity because it didn't

227
00:13:45,011 --> 00:13:47,820
exist yet and it was a big need.
Um,

228
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:52,000
and we built the first version
of Instagram a note. By the way,

229
00:13:52,001 --> 00:13:56,320
the first version of Instagram did not
have filters. Um, and people forget,

230
00:13:56,321 --> 00:14:01,000
the only reason Instagram worked early
on was because of the filters and filters

231
00:14:01,001 --> 00:14:03,840
came about because I was on
this walk with my wife. Uh,

232
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,390
we were taking a small vacation.
I had been working on Bourbon for a while,

233
00:14:07,391 --> 00:14:11,500
I was exhausted. Um, and we're
taking this walk along the beach.

234
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:14,800
And I was like, oh, so you're excited
about this new APP we're building.

235
00:14:14,801 --> 00:14:17,500
We haven't called it Instagram
yet. She was like, yeah,

236
00:14:17,501 --> 00:14:19,840
but I don't think I'm gonna use it
cause my photos aren't that good.

237
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:23,650
I'm was like, okay, well why
don't you think your photos
are good? And she's like,

238
00:14:23,651 --> 00:14:24,850
well all your friends,
you know,

239
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,080
you post these amazing photos and
they're all like filtered it and stuff.

240
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,750
And I was like, oh, that's because
they use filters. And she goes,

241
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:36,550
oh well you should probably add filters.
And uh, we came back from that walk.

242
00:14:36,551 --> 00:14:40,900
I went straight to the room and I just
like got on my laptop and I made the

243
00:14:40,901 --> 00:14:43,780
first filter, which was x pro two. Um,

244
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:47,470
this is the long way of
saying we cut features,

245
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:52,370
we focused on what we thought the world
needed and then we got to the heart of

246
00:14:52,371 --> 00:14:55,700
the issue of why people wouldn't use it
because people didn't feel comfortable

247
00:14:55,701 --> 00:15:00,701
sharing their photos by solving those
things right in a row and keeping it Uber

248
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:01,874
simple.

249
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,990
I mean even that first filter could have
been written in open GL and could have

250
00:15:05,991 --> 00:15:07,940
been a lot faster.
You tap on that filter,

251
00:15:07,941 --> 00:15:11,600
it took like three seconds to
show you the filter. No one cared.

252
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:15,350
It was fine. Yeah. Keep it
simple. Keep it super simple.

253
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,740
Now you mentioned,
you mentioned Eric Reese.

254
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:22,610
His book is as perhaps
one of the influences, uh,

255
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,740
Lake to look at or dig
for lessons learned,

256
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:30,200
best practices,
observed,

257
00:15:30,201 --> 00:15:33,230
anything at all that you took
away or very difficult times.

258
00:15:33,231 --> 00:15:36,410
Anything from a few previous experiences.

259
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:41,720
So we'll go back to the
Mayfield fellows program.

260
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:42,410
Uh,

261
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:47,410
was there anything in that program
that you found particularly useful?

262
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,380
Uh, and then the next,
then I'll hit. So, uh,

263
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:55,130
we can certainly do them in
order or not would be Odo. Yeah,

264
00:15:56,490 --> 00:16:00,990
I mean, where, where do I start?
Okay. So, and what did he bless feel?

265
00:16:00,991 --> 00:16:03,830
Fellows program? Yeah,
Mayfield fellows program. Uh,

266
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:09,630
it's a program at Stanford where they
take, I think they still take 12 a year,

267
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:13,030
12, uh, typically graduate students. Um,

268
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:15,730
although I snuck in and I'll
explain that in a second. Um,

269
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,650
who are interested in
entrepreneurship and they, um,

270
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,070
they focus on what is called
an entrepreneurship education.

271
00:16:23,071 --> 00:16:24,960
So they do three months of case studies,

272
00:16:24,961 --> 00:16:26,550
kind of like going to
Harvard Business School,

273
00:16:26,551 --> 00:16:31,230
but case studies on just
entrepreneurship. Then three months, uh,

274
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,750
you spend,
um,

275
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:36,930
at a real startup getting real experience
and then you come back and the last

276
00:16:36,931 --> 00:16:40,160
three months, so it's a
year long program, uh,

277
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,660
meaning three quarters of the school year,
um,

278
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:47,550
you come back and you debrief on your
own experience and you actually write

279
00:16:47,551 --> 00:16:52,440
basically a case on your, um, experience
over the summer. So I did that.

280
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:57,340
Uh, I, my junior year I snuck in
by like, I dunno, I basically,

281
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,960
I was like, Hey, but like I founded
this startup, not really a startup.

282
00:17:00,961 --> 00:17:04,020
It was a website at the time that
was like a competitor to craigslist,

283
00:17:04,021 --> 00:17:07,230
but for Stanford students only.
And uh,

284
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:10,860
I prayed that they would take me cause
I was so excited about entrepreneurship

285
00:17:10,861 --> 00:17:14,540
and they let me in, um,
years later, by the way, uh,

286
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:17,010
one of the people who ran the
program still runs the program,

287
00:17:17,011 --> 00:17:19,170
actually pulled me aside and was like,
just so you know,

288
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:23,250
we were barely about to let you in.
And I was like, thank God you did.

289
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:23,971
And she was like,

290
00:17:23,971 --> 00:17:27,810
but the thing that made the difference
was that you were out there actually

291
00:17:27,811 --> 00:17:28,980
trying to start something.

292
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:34,520
And I guess less than number one is like
never expect you're going to get a no,

293
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,450
like always put your name in,
right.

294
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:39,690
Number two is actually do the thing,

295
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,450
like actually start the startup.
It don't just go to conferences about it,

296
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:46,990
don't just like write articles
about, started to something. Um,

297
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,250
and that carries a lot of weight. Um,
but that was Mayfield fellows program.

298
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:55,280
And maybe the last lesson on the Mayfield
fellows program that I got from it was

299
00:17:56,310 --> 00:18:00,690
real. There's nothing in the world that
can substitute for real experience.

300
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:03,630
Doesn't matter what we're talking about.
If you want to be a chef,

301
00:18:03,631 --> 00:18:06,480
working in a kitchen is the only way
you're going to learn going into culinary

302
00:18:06,481 --> 00:18:10,500
school. Whatever I'm sure is great. But
working in a kitchen is the way to do it.

303
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:15,300
If you want to be, gosh, um, like a,

304
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:18,120
like a tech founder, right?
You got to start a startup.

305
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:20,940
You've got to know what it feels
like to put it all on the line,

306
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,250
lose everything and then come back.
Right.

307
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:25,590
You can't learn about
investing unless you invest.

308
00:18:25,591 --> 00:18:27,150
I mean name whatever profession.

309
00:18:27,151 --> 00:18:30,450
It's like real experience is so
much better than what's in a book.

310
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,600
That doesn't mean that books aren't
helpful, but you've got to do it.

311
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,110
But they're in the adjunct.
Yeah.

312
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,340
Very hard to become a professional soccer
player by reading books on the physics

313
00:18:38,341 --> 00:18:42,300
of soccer. Although I gotta tell you,
I took this personality test, um,

314
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,070
and the results came back,

315
00:18:44,071 --> 00:18:47,820
but one of the main takeaways was
like prefers learning by reading.

316
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:50,190
And I was reading my results to my
family cause I thought it would be

317
00:18:50,191 --> 00:18:54,570
entertaining. And my mom was like, oh my
God. Like I remember when you were a kid,

318
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,030
you just read everything.
And my dad was like, yeah,

319
00:18:57,031 --> 00:19:01,680
like you said you were
going to be interested in
playing baseball. So, uh, uh,

320
00:19:01,681 --> 00:19:04,440
I was like, I bought a Mitt for you
and we were going to go play catch.

321
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,500
And you're like, Dad, I got to go to
the library. And my dad was like, what?

322
00:19:07,501 --> 00:19:08,940
And he's like,
I got to read about it.

323
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:13,200
So I literally went to the library and
read about how to pitch and then played.

324
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:17,460
And I think that's my ammo. It's just
I'm wired that way. Did you remember the,

325
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,340
it was an okay pension,

326
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:22,710
the name of the personality test
or the assessment leading? Um,

327
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:27,690
yes, it was the, uh, golden personality
tests. Schooled and personality.

328
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:32,370
I think it was golden. Yeah. Why
did you take that test? It's a a,

329
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:35,180
it's a variant on the Myers Briggs test.
Uh,

330
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:38,820
but it actually gives you very
specific breakdowns of every dimension.

331
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:42,430
So for those of you listening that
don't know the Myers Briggs test, uh,

332
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,830
there are basically four main
dimensions, uh, of the personality test.

333
00:19:46,831 --> 00:19:48,150
And it tells you,
for instance,

334
00:19:48,151 --> 00:19:53,151
whether you're more casual or if you're
like very calculated and punctual,

335
00:19:53,161 --> 00:19:57,630
that kind of stuff. Um, I wanted
to know more about what I was like.

336
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,880
I had talked about Ray Daleo before.
Um,

337
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:04,280
I spoke with him and he was saying,
yeah, everyone who joins Bridgewater,

338
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,750
we give this personality test. And
I was like, well, can I take it?

339
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:11,160
Like I want to know what I am like.
And my cofounder took it,

340
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:15,660
a bunch of our senior execs took it.
Um, and it was illuminating to learn,

341
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:19,050
see on paper,
which you know in the back of your mind.

342
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:21,540
And then of course it
helps you work with others.

343
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:26,310
But a big part of it was reading on
paper what you're actually alike and

344
00:20:26,311 --> 00:20:29,130
realizing for instance,
I do learn by reading.

345
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,820
So I'm not someone who likes to sit in
a lecture hall. I want to have the book.

346
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,250
So if I'm going to learn something new,

347
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:39,360
like the way to learn is not for
me to go to like a, a conference.

348
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,230
It's to like sit down with the best book
possible and that might not apply to

349
00:20:43,231 --> 00:20:46,290
you. Right? Like if you took it, maybe
you like learning some other way,

350
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:50,050
but I wanted to know what my API was.

351
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:54,330
So that was helpful here. Api.
Yeah, I like it. That's true. Yeah.

352
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,570
We all learned application programming
interface. He used to know some acronyms,

353
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:01,030
uh,
on reading.

354
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:06,090
There are different ways to
read books and I had, uh,

355
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:08,800
found in some of the research
for this conversation.

356
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:13,390
A mention of Mortimer Adler
is how to read a book. Yeah.

357
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:18,400
Could you talk about how you read?
How weird is it that I'm like,

358
00:21:18,401 --> 00:21:21,580
so into reading that I have to
find a boat that's how to read.

359
00:21:21,581 --> 00:21:25,510
Like where does it stop? How to
read, how to read a book. Um,

360
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:29,650
have you ever read the book? I
haven't. Okay. Um, it's fine. Um,

361
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:34,780
I can save you some time. Yeah.
Basically the idea behind this book is,

362
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,673
uh,

363
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:39,850
it's how to read a book most effectively.

364
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:44,440
Most people open the first page and they
start with the first word and then they

365
00:21:44,441 --> 00:21:49,060
go until either that they get bored
or they push through or whatever. Um,

366
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,180
and the claim and the book is
basically that, that is not correct.

367
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:56,620
That instead what you should do is
familiarize yourself with the structure of

368
00:21:56,621 --> 00:22:01,600
the book first. So the most important,
uh, I, I would say his thesis,

369
00:22:01,601 --> 00:22:05,140
the F is that the most important part of
reading a book is to actually read the

370
00:22:05,141 --> 00:22:10,000
table of contents and familiarize yourself
with like the major structure of the

371
00:22:10,001 --> 00:22:14,800
book and then familiarize yourself by
skimming the book and figuring out what

372
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:16,750
the main arguments are.
In fact,

373
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:21,870
one of the secrets that I love and I can
still do to this day is most authors in

374
00:22:22,811 --> 00:22:24,670
the last paragraph of every chapter,

375
00:22:24,671 --> 00:22:27,820
especially the last paragraph of the book,

376
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,550
will not only summarize
their main arguments,

377
00:22:30,551 --> 00:22:33,730
but make the points they actually have
been waiting to make the entire chapter.

378
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,640
And by reading just those paragraphs,

379
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:39,460
you get a pretty good idea
of what the book's about.

380
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:43,120
Then you go back and you
read like you normally read.

381
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:47,380
But with the context of knowing the
overall arc of the story rather than

382
00:22:47,381 --> 00:22:48,730
guessing where it's going to go.

383
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:53,620
I don't recommend doing this with the
thriller because of the old ruin your but

384
00:22:53,621 --> 00:22:57,850
with nonfiction I think it's
fantastic. Um, but that's, uh,

385
00:22:57,851 --> 00:22:59,200
that's how to read a book.
And by the way,

386
00:22:59,201 --> 00:23:02,470
for those of you Mortimer fans out there,
I probably didn't do it justice,

387
00:23:02,471 --> 00:23:06,460
but go by the book,
kind of go by the book,

388
00:23:06,461 --> 00:23:10,750
which will encourage you to buy yet
more books. I have this seriously,

389
00:23:10,751 --> 00:23:13,210
if I could show you my room right now,
my bedside table,

390
00:23:13,211 --> 00:23:16,680
it's just stacked with books.
I've got a book called uh,

391
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:21,250
mathematics politics cause I'm interested
in both politics and also the math

392
00:23:21,251 --> 00:23:26,020
behind elections and that stuff. I think
how to read a books probably there.

393
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:30,220
Um, one of the books do I have, I've
got books on, uh, on flying cars.

394
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:34,120
I'm learning to be a pilot.
Um, it like, it ranges. Oh,

395
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:37,840
I've got a quantitative finance
books I've got, but like,

396
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:41,920
it's the most fun I've ever had. Just
like plowing through books. I guess.

397
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:44,680
It's good. I don't have a
job right now. I don't know.

398
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:51,620
It does create a little space is how
quickly it gets filled out. It does.

399
00:23:51,621 --> 00:23:55,210
Well, I mean, you're not talking,
I don't think. Is it podcasts?

400
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:57,590
Especially the long ones.
Uh,

401
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:01,670
Odo what was Odo

402
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:06,860
and uh, what did you learn
there? What did you observe?

403
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:10,600
Yeah, audio was the
precursor to Twitter. So, um,

404
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:16,420
you were talking about Mayfield fellows
program. Uh, my internship was ODL.

405
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:21,070
So that three months over the
summer I spent at Odeo. Um,

406
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:25,540
I remember I showed up the first day I
brought my own computer because I thought

407
00:24:25,541 --> 00:24:28,000
when you worked at a company, you bring
your own computer. Cause I was like,

408
00:24:28,001 --> 00:24:31,930
I don't know. Computers are expensive.
Right? Like you bring your own. Um,

409
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:34,120
and they're like, oh good.
You brought your own computer.

410
00:24:34,121 --> 00:24:38,260
I think there were thrilled. Um,
and it was a Evan Williams and,

411
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:42,550
and no glass where the cofounders
of Odo and uh, they were like, oh,

412
00:24:42,551 --> 00:24:46,120
I forgot you started today.
And I was like, Yep, here I am.

413
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,660
And actually it was one of
the best experiences learning
from Av who's brilliant.

414
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:51,130
Um,
and Noah,

415
00:24:51,131 --> 00:24:55,210
who's also brilliant and like just
seeing that startup tried to take off,

416
00:24:55,211 --> 00:24:59,460
it was a podcast directory, believe
it or not, maybe a little early. Um,

417
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:02,380
it was the right way of they just paddle
a little early. Yeah. Which by the way,

418
00:25:02,381 --> 00:25:05,650
another lesson and this whole thing,
timing is everything.

419
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:10,480
Like the number of amazing ideas and
teams that either came too early or too

420
00:25:10,481 --> 00:25:15,250
late. It's like you've got to have that
essential element of timing and it's the

421
00:25:15,251 --> 00:25:19,780
hardest to predict. But it was a
podcast directory and you know,

422
00:25:19,781 --> 00:25:20,960
honestly a lot of the,

423
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:25,030
the famous podcast folks got started on
Odo and there are a bunch of that are

424
00:25:25,031 --> 00:25:25,721
still around,

425
00:25:25,721 --> 00:25:30,490
but it turns out back then there wasn't
exactly a business around podcasts and

426
00:25:30,491 --> 00:25:34,330
it didn't go so well and
they ended up pivoting to a,

427
00:25:34,331 --> 00:25:37,240
an idea started by an engineer.
There are Jack Dorsey,

428
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:41,770
who by the way also started I think
like maybe my first or second day.

429
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,800
And I remember him walking in and I'm
like on the Internet. He's like, Oh,

430
00:25:44,801 --> 00:25:47,350
I'm jack. And uh, I learned,

431
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:50,770
actually he gave me a couple of coding
assignments over the summer. Um,

432
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:54,490
I remember learning some javascript
from him. So it's a small world.

433
00:25:54,491 --> 00:25:58,690
It turns out super small, but that's
what Odio was and that was my experience.

434
00:25:58,691 --> 00:26:01,570
It was awesome and I'm very
thankful to all those guys.

435
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:06,390
What do you view as some of say,
just as an example, as superpowers?

436
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:10,790
I mean, he's a very impressive guy,
very understated in a lot of ways. Uh,

437
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:14,420
what did you, what did you observe, uh,

438
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,430
in the secret sauce of, of f?
Because he's also a repeat player,

439
00:26:19,431 --> 00:26:23,990
right? I mean, this is, he's not
a one hit wonder. So what, uh,

440
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:26,180
what have you observed in him?
It

441
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:30,210
turns out blogging and communication
is a thing and it doesn't go away. Um,

442
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:33,360
and there are lots of companies
that can be started around it. Um,

443
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:38,530
what did I observe? Uh, what was
really long time ago, but, um,

444
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:43,000
or what superpowers do you think he has?
He could talk present tense too. So I,

445
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,730
he's super determined. Um,
and super calm under fire.

446
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:49,590
There are a lot of,
uh,

447
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:55,950
there are a lot of CEO's
that, um, are very like,

448
00:26:55,951 --> 00:27:00,900
uh, emotionally volatile and
AV, at least in my experience,

449
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,880
is not one of those people.
In fact,

450
00:27:02,881 --> 00:27:07,650
he's determined and hardworking and I
can't remember his background story,

451
00:27:07,651 --> 00:27:10,530
but he's like, yeah, you
know, I went to this college,

452
00:27:10,531 --> 00:27:15,531
it wasn't that great and I just worked
my ass off to get here and to build this

453
00:27:15,961 --> 00:27:19,440
thing and then eventually
sell it to Google that was
blogger and then to be able

454
00:27:19,441 --> 00:27:23,670
to start this thing. And I remember
his work ethic because at one point,

455
00:27:23,671 --> 00:27:28,230
I'm pretty sure he was convinced we all
were working hard enough. So he sent us,

456
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:29,890
he didn't send us,
he,

457
00:27:29,891 --> 00:27:34,050
he offered for us to go to this seminar
by David Allen getting things done.

458
00:27:34,051 --> 00:27:38,250
And then I remember sitting
in the audience and just
like the Odo crew that were

459
00:27:38,251 --> 00:27:38,851
like,
I don't know,

460
00:27:38,851 --> 00:27:43,740
six or seven of us at the time at the
David Allen getting things done, you know,

461
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:48,210
uh, not conference but seminar. I still
try to use that stuff today, by the way.

462
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:53,340
Um, but the signal was like, we work
hard here and we get stuff done.

463
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:58,380
And he was there. He was the
first one in, last one out. Um,

464
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:01,470
and as a CEO I understood
what that model meant,

465
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:05,580
one that I could learn from the CEO that
if they had ways of getting things done,

466
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:07,890
you could,
you could learn that as an employee.

467
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:11,670
And I tried very hard at Instagram
to learn stuff and then pass it on.

468
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:17,100
But also just the work ethic that is
required to get startups off the ground.

469
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,590
It's incredible.
Plus willing to call it,

470
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:23,400
like he was willing to call Odo and
pivot to this thing called Twitter.

471
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:27,930
And Trust me when we were calling it
on Bourbon and pivoting to Instagram,

472
00:28:27,931 --> 00:28:30,870
I was thinking about that moment. I
wasn't there in the room when they did it,

473
00:28:30,871 --> 00:28:34,110
but I can imagine, you know, the,

474
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:39,090
the bravery that it takes to switch
like that, it's hard. But uh,

475
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,520
but paying attention to people like ev,

476
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:44,100
an entrepreneurs like that
and entrepreneurs like Jack,

477
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:47,970
I think you begin to learn that there
are patterns and you have a little faith

478
00:28:47,971 --> 00:28:51,540
in their ways and, and you, you end
up trying to mirror it in many ways.

479
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:56,870
I completely agree on the edge of having
a calmness as a competitive advantage.

480
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:05,180
He's very good at pausing
and not jumping to respond.

481
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,320
Uh,
so he's,

482
00:29:08,321 --> 00:29:11,940
he's been able to choose his response
I suppose instead of being reactive.

483
00:29:11,941 --> 00:29:15,480
I think you're very good at that as well.
Thanks. And um, I want to talk about,

484
00:29:15,481 --> 00:29:20,280
since it's come up a few times,
uh, pivoting or ending projects.

485
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:23,790
Yeah. Because there's a, in some aspects,

486
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:28,820
a fetishizing of perseverance in a lot
of places including silicon valley,

487
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,850
the world of tech.
And yet if you,

488
00:29:31,851 --> 00:29:36,600
if you look at a lot of the
largest public successes,

489
00:29:36,601 --> 00:29:41,010
many of them had some type of pivot or
shutting down of something that wasn't

490
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:41,853
working.

491
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:42,903
Uh,

492
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:47,590
how do you know it's the
right time to stop in when,

493
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:50,800
how does one go about making
that difficult decision?

494
00:29:50,801 --> 00:29:53,710
Like are there telltale
signs that this is just,

495
00:29:53,711 --> 00:29:58,450
it's not that another 50% of effort is
required another x number of hours per

496
00:29:58,451 --> 00:29:58,541
day,

497
00:29:58,541 --> 00:30:02,560
but like this is fundamentally flawed
in some way that is going to prevent it

498
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:06,490
from working. I think, let's
take this question in two parts.

499
00:30:06,491 --> 00:30:10,270
First is let's just talk about the
premise that most successful things,

500
00:30:10,271 --> 00:30:12,370
our pivots,
which I believe is true.

501
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,930
One of the really fun things to do is
actually, do you know the wayback machine?

502
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:20,860
I do. Right. Uh, I think it still
exists. I haven't tried it a long time,

503
00:30:20,861 --> 00:30:23,260
but you can go and type
in any way web address.

504
00:30:23,261 --> 00:30:28,261
And then I think it allows you to like
select the date of that website so you

505
00:30:28,781 --> 00:30:31,480
can basically see the history of the web.
It's super interesting.

506
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:37,260
Go to youtube and figure out
when Youtube was founded.

507
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:40,420
I can't remember, but like you can
look it up on Wikipedia, right?

508
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:42,100
And go to that date.

509
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:47,130
Like around the beginning you will see
youtube was a dating site before it

510
00:30:47,411 --> 00:30:50,320
became youtube. What we
know as youtube. Right.

511
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:55,830
Do that for most major things that you
get excited about or like look up the

512
00:30:56,291 --> 00:30:59,460
history of Facebook when it was, you
know, it was facemash beforehand.

513
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:00,520
It was something before that.

514
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:04,240
I'm the only one that I don't think
was a pivot was Google and they've done

515
00:31:04,241 --> 00:31:07,340
pretty well. So that's the
one counter example. Um,

516
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:10,630
like that literally was their project
and they made it a company and it worked

517
00:31:10,631 --> 00:31:14,680
really well. So I don't know.
Um, but most other projects,

518
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:17,950
our um,
our pivots from an original idea.

519
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,900
And I think that's because one,

520
00:31:19,901 --> 00:31:24,790
it's really hard to tell what works a
priority like doing it before anything

521
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:28,960
before you actually, you know,
put it into, into people's hands.

522
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:31,720
It's really difficult.
Like you don't know if it's going to work.

523
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:35,980
The key to entrepreneurship
is failing really quickly.

524
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:39,910
So putting it out there, seeing
if it works, if it doesn't,

525
00:31:39,911 --> 00:31:44,911
than diagnosing why and then like
focusing on how to improve it from there.

526
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,270
Um,
so one,

527
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:50,920
I agree with the premise that
most things are in fact, uh,

528
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:55,950
like second runs and then
to the importance of pivot
I think is that most of the

529
00:31:57,161 --> 00:32:00,730
time you get it wrong. So the question
is knowing you're going to get it wrong,

530
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,200
how equipped are you to deal with that
failure really quickly before you run out

531
00:32:05,201 --> 00:32:06,034
of money.

532
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:11,050
And the entrepreneurs that I've seen do
very well are the ones that are equipped

533
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:16,060
and engaged on the change from something
that's not working to something that is

534
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:20,470
far too many people because of ego or
whatever. Stick with ideas far too long.

535
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,290
And, uh, I think, you know,

536
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:26,770
it ends up really poor that yet or look
at something that isn't working that

537
00:32:26,771 --> 00:32:29,770
might have a different application.
Right. If you look at post it notes,

538
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:32,400
we actually a failed adhesive, right? Yep.

539
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:36,970
And then you look at say
five Agra which was failed.

540
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:40,100
It was a,
a failure from the perspective of

541
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:45,490
whatever it was initially a
tested for or intended for,

542
00:32:45,501 --> 00:32:48,980
which I think was lowering blood pressure
and normalizing for blood pressure.

543
00:32:48,981 --> 00:32:50,900
And then the,
excuse me,

544
00:32:50,901 --> 00:32:54,200
can you check off all the side
effects of this blood pressure pill?

545
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:56,600
There's a pattern here.
The,

546
00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:00,890
the recipients were asked to send back
their samples and all the women's send

547
00:33:00,891 --> 00:33:03,350
their samples back and almost none
of the men did. And they're like,

548
00:33:03,351 --> 00:33:05,080
wait a second,
what's going on here?

549
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:08,510
I can't tell if this is a family friendly
show and we should dive into this or

550
00:33:08,511 --> 00:33:10,130
how we can, we can, uh, you know,

551
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:13,850
it is family friendly but a modern
family still be the director. Scott,

552
00:33:13,851 --> 00:33:16,540
this will be the, the director's
cut. This is like no way. Pivots,

553
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:22,460
pivots are important.
And how do you train,

554
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:28,180
if you do the ability to recognize say
confirmation bias or this is something

555
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:36,860
certainly ray thinks a lot about is
identifying from the perspective of an

556
00:33:36,861 --> 00:33:41,861
investor where you might have piece
coming to sum cost fallacy or any of these

557
00:33:41,961 --> 00:33:46,430
other things that could steer you to make
bad decisions or we're not stop things

558
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,320
has,
is that something that you've,

559
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:53,410
you've trained in yourself or is
that innate from birth or upbringing?

560
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:58,570
I think I was talking with my wife
the other day and I was like, Nicole,

561
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:03,960
I think one of my failures is that like
I always think things are not going to

562
00:34:05,561 --> 00:34:10,290
work out or I'm wrong in some way. And,
and we were going back and forth. I was,

563
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,201
she was like,
oh,

564
00:34:11,201 --> 00:34:15,640
well maybe that's actually a strength
because like you're so hard on an idea

565
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:21,150
that you're like trying to prove yourself
wrong to test the integrity of your

566
00:34:22,031 --> 00:34:25,810
idea or a test, the integrity
of your thesis or, and like,

567
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:27,040
so you mentioned ray,

568
00:34:27,041 --> 00:34:32,041
like I think a big part of knowing that
you're right is working as hard as you

569
00:34:33,161 --> 00:34:36,700
can to prove that you're wrong.
And if you can't,

570
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,890
well there's only one option left,
which is you're probably right. Um,

571
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:44,560
but a lot of people I think
are afraid to gather feedback.

572
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:48,910
I think Mike and I at
Instagram very early on,

573
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:52,270
tried our best to be open to feedback.

574
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:55,030
I think as a young executive
I was like, no, I'm the boss.

575
00:34:55,031 --> 00:34:57,790
Like all ideas are great, all
my ideas are great. Right?

576
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:02,950
And after a couple of failures, I think
you learn really quickly that like,

577
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:03,813
hey listen,

578
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:08,410
I know there's this myth that like the
best founders just have like the midas

579
00:35:08,411 --> 00:35:12,250
touch and every idea they have is
perfect. You know, like Steve Jobs,

580
00:35:12,251 --> 00:35:14,950
he touches everything and it just
becomes gold. And it's right.

581
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:17,980
But it turns out there a lot of
failures in these people's lives.

582
00:35:17,981 --> 00:35:22,930
They just usually get written out of
history. And then what you see is a,

583
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,630
as a trail of amazing ideas.
I mean,

584
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:30,930
so much to write a book on all the bad
ideas amazing people have had right over

585
00:35:31,091 --> 00:35:34,930
the years. And because she has
10 volumes set. Totally. But like

586
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,350
I think get the wrong idea. There
is no Mitus touch. Like the,

587
00:35:40,351 --> 00:35:45,060
one of the things I hated most working
in tech was the idea that there's like a

588
00:35:45,061 --> 00:35:47,070
product guy or a product girl,
right?

589
00:35:47,071 --> 00:35:51,270
Like that you're like somehow someone
who just knows what's going to work.

590
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:56,610
Most of the successful people I know
have tons of bad ideas and it's about

591
00:35:56,611 --> 00:36:00,810
editing them out. Um, and figuring
out which one is actually right.

592
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,810
Because honestly,
what does the Mendoza line?

593
00:36:03,811 --> 00:36:08,400
It's like if you bet 200 like above 200
year, like a pretty good batter, right?

594
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:12,480
In a world where your
average is going to be 1%,

595
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:16,890
you've got to generate a
ton of ideas before you get
one roughly a hundred right?

596
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:20,910
Yeah. So, and 1% would be like
way higher than the average.

597
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:24,390
So how do you figure out which is the one?
It's,

598
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:29,160
I think it's by being super not mean to
yourself, a critical on the idea in a,

599
00:36:29,161 --> 00:36:33,750
in a constructive way and pressure
testing it with other people. Um,

600
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:37,300
but I just,
I like always have an,

601
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,290
I'm just wired in a
way that assumes every,

602
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,190
whether it's idea or thesis or
whatever I have is wrong. And I'm,

603
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:49,270
I'm more worried about being
wrong than I am looking bad,

604
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:50,483
you know what I mean?

605
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:54,150
No, I get it. Do you have any, uh,

606
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:58,870
particular questions that you ask
yourself or other people when your stress

607
00:36:58,871 --> 00:37:03,871
testing an idea or alternatively
how you solicit feedback and,

608
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,200
um,
I give an example since I write,

609
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:12,430
I have all these books. I want
people to act as proofreaders. Uh,

610
00:37:12,431 --> 00:37:17,431
but I don't want them since they are
my friends to be an unnecessarily nice,

611
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:21,760
but guess what? They all light.
Yeah. And so I will, I, I,

612
00:37:21,761 --> 00:37:24,310
one of the questions I'll ask them,
I is in a given chapter,

613
00:37:24,311 --> 00:37:28,030
I'll say you had to cut
10 to 20% gun to the head,

614
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:32,500
which tend to 20 would go nice. Right.
And it forces their hand in a sense.

615
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:38,700
Are there other approaches that you like
to use or like others to use on your

616
00:37:39,611 --> 00:37:40,780
ideas for stress testing?

617
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,230
Well,
first off,

618
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:49,260
I think it's important to realize
how people are just wired.

619
00:37:49,331 --> 00:37:53,710
Not to be honest. Not that they lie. I
mean, I guess technically it's a lie,

620
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,830
but I don't think it like
comes from a bad place.

621
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:00,940
They're wired to avoid conflict.

622
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:04,900
So like you go in a restaurant
and the server comes by, you know,

623
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:06,790
maybe you didn't like it
as the server comes by.

624
00:38:06,791 --> 00:38:11,110
When's the last time you
actually literally told them
like everything was great,

625
00:38:11,111 --> 00:38:14,050
but that thing was too salty? That was,
you know, I like to eat. By the way.

626
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,490
That thing was too salty.
That was undercooked.

627
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:20,620
Like next time you go out to eat and
they're like, how was everything?

628
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:23,170
And you're like, you
instinctively just respond. Great.

629
00:38:23,171 --> 00:38:27,580
Thanks if it is that
actually what you thought.

630
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:31,240
Like most people have one or two
things they wish could be better.

631
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:35,650
And what's crazy is I think of myself
in that situation every time I was down

632
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,380
there, I'm like, man, if I
were on the other side of this,

633
00:38:38,381 --> 00:38:42,730
I'd really want to know the
truth because without the truth,

634
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:46,510
you can't improve. Right.
And you have to be careful.

635
00:38:46,511 --> 00:38:48,970
Cause sometimes people have opinions
and they're not always right,

636
00:38:48,971 --> 00:38:51,400
but only if you don't know,
you can't act on it.

637
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:55,730
And I've been surprised how
many people I've met, um,

638
00:38:56,020 --> 00:39:00,400
at least in the food industry, right?
Where at least if you do it in a nice way,

639
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:04,450
you're like, listen, I just, if I
were on the receiving end of this,

640
00:39:04,451 --> 00:39:08,320
I'd want to know so I'm giving this
to you, do whatever you want with it.

641
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:12,310
And it's always interesting to see that
people that are like grateful for that

642
00:39:12,311 --> 00:39:16,330
feedback and you're like, that person's
going to go kick some ass. Totally.

643
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:20,410
And the people who are like, what's
supposed to be that way? You know?

644
00:39:20,411 --> 00:39:25,250
And you're like, well, okay, like, but
like what if it isn't? You know, like,

645
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:26,613
um,

646
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:31,000
and I think it's really important
as you mature as an executive.

647
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:34,360
Like I definitely started in the place
where I just like didn't listen to

648
00:39:34,361 --> 00:39:36,400
feedback. I was, you know, headstrong.

649
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:40,270
And then as you have more and more
failures that by the way, everyone has,

650
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:44,980
you begin to realize it's really
important to collect that data and that

651
00:39:44,981 --> 00:39:46,210
information from people.

652
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:50,530
No one would tell me like
when I was presenting on
stage, everyone would be like,

653
00:39:50,531 --> 00:39:53,890
great talk, great, awesome job.
Great. You killed it. And I was like,

654
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,610
that's not possible. Like, like a
few talks in a row that happened.

655
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,240
And then we hired someone and I'm not
going to pick on them and tell you who

656
00:40:01,241 --> 00:40:01,481
they are,

657
00:40:01,481 --> 00:40:06,481
but we hired someone who came up to me
after and Gabey three pieces of feedback.

658
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:09,430
They were like, you need to smile
more. You need to do that. Like,

659
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:11,020
I know you're a happy person,

660
00:40:11,021 --> 00:40:13,870
but you're not smiling when you're
talking about this really happy subject,

661
00:40:13,871 --> 00:40:15,940
like smile. And I was like, oh
my God, that person's right.

662
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:20,470
They literally watched every single
interview I had done for like the last two

663
00:40:20,471 --> 00:40:25,471
years and just had a list of things and
I was so grateful for that because it

664
00:40:25,841 --> 00:40:27,700
was feedback that no
one else would give me.

665
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:32,680
Do you remember any of the
other points? Uh, it was, um,

666
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:37,660
slow down pause, right?
Uh, it was smile more.

667
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,550
Not because you're trying
to give off a vibe that,

668
00:40:39,551 --> 00:40:43,250
but just what's funny is you can't
overdo smiling. It turns out like it's,

669
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,400
it's hard. Um, and I'm just like,

670
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:47,890
I'm a serious person so I
don't think smile as much. Uh,

671
00:40:47,891 --> 00:40:50,440
what were the other things?
I'd have to go back to my notes,

672
00:40:50,441 --> 00:40:53,600
but those are the two things
that stood out. Yeah. It's a,

673
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:56,740
people don't give you feedback. It's
crazy. And by the way, the thing is,

674
00:40:56,741 --> 00:41:00,070
the more important your company gets,
the higher up you go,

675
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,080
the less people are willing to do it.
Yeah.

676
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,640
So you actually have to like dig for it.

677
00:41:03,641 --> 00:41:05,530
And that's one of the
weirdest feelings ever is.

678
00:41:05,531 --> 00:41:09,310
Please tell me something negative,
but you asked a specific question,

679
00:41:09,311 --> 00:41:11,080
which is like what are the tools to do it?

680
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:15,640
I don't know that there are any like
specific tools so much as like when's the

681
00:41:15,641 --> 00:41:17,710
last time you,
the listener did that?

682
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:20,710
When's the last time you went out
of your way and you said, hey,

683
00:41:20,711 --> 00:41:25,150
like I really want honest feedback on
this. And when someone gives you feedback,

684
00:41:25,151 --> 00:41:26,830
you don't respond in a defensive way.

685
00:41:26,831 --> 00:41:29,980
You say thank you and you
encourage the behavior.

686
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:35,570
If you could do that man, like the
self improvement that comes with that.

687
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:36,533
Yeah.

688
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:39,310
And the honesty that comes with it if,

689
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,970
depending on the format can
be a really remarkable, I,

690
00:41:42,971 --> 00:41:47,170
you may have done this before,
but I had not done a a 360 interview.

691
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:51,400
Oh yeah. I avoided doing the first one
they wanted me to do ever. I was like, oh,

692
00:41:51,401 --> 00:41:55,340
this is just like a, a management
thing. And then the second one I did,

693
00:41:55,341 --> 00:42:00,010
I literally tried hard to do it. Like
I asked people to participate. I said,

694
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:02,420
please be as honest as
possible. Yeah. And, uh,

695
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:06,990
I remember I was chatting with
Joe Gibeah about his first three,

696
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:10,130
16 year reviewed for people who
do not know what that is. Uh,

697
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:14,970
there are different ways to approach
it, but in effect, your superiors,

698
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:19,830
peers, slash colleagues and
subordinates are all interviewed.

699
00:42:19,831 --> 00:42:22,710
So the people that you interact with
most or all interviewed about your

700
00:42:22,711 --> 00:42:25,500
strengths and weaknesses and so on.
And very frequently,

701
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:29,400
at least in my case with uh,
my employees and so on,

702
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:34,850
it was anonymized to ratchet
up the allowable honesty.

703
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,120
And,
uh,

704
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:41,630
it was a great example of how valuable
honesty can be and also how difficult it

705
00:42:43,051 --> 00:42:46,080
can be to digest if it's
really full frontal.

706
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:49,870
And I think Joe said he like went
to his car and the parking lot.

707
00:42:49,871 --> 00:42:54,450
I cried afterwards. I had a tough time.
I had a really tough time with it,

708
00:42:54,451 --> 00:42:57,990
but it ended up being very helpful and
I was able to look at it with a cooler

709
00:42:57,991 --> 00:42:59,310
head,
not because I was angry,

710
00:42:59,311 --> 00:43:03,630
but I was really sort of like cut down
at the knees by some of the comments.

711
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:07,320
And it was really important. I mean,
if you've spinach stuck in your teeth,

712
00:43:07,321 --> 00:43:10,440
you need somebody to tell you.
The hardest

713
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:15,440
part is how to tell when
you've got spinach stuck in
your teeth or someone just

714
00:43:15,871 --> 00:43:20,670
doesn't like you and,
but you have to be willing to get both.

715
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:21,743
Yeah.

716
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:25,110
And then ask yourself which of these
have merit and not to write things off,

717
00:43:25,111 --> 00:43:28,470
but you have to be able to go through
it and just ask yourself. Um, but yeah,

718
00:43:28,471 --> 00:43:32,310
that was hard. Yeah. I remember
my first one and I just,

719
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:37,530
but now I think about it and like,
no matter what I do,

720
00:43:37,890 --> 00:43:42,600
whether it's another company, whether
I'm doing a writing project or a podcast,

721
00:43:42,601 --> 00:43:47,370
whatever, like, so I just walked off
the stage at south by southwest and um,

722
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:51,510
I could see the screen that was displayed
after we left and they asked people to

723
00:43:51,511 --> 00:43:55,740
rate the rate, everything like rate
the speakers are at the hose. Like,

724
00:43:56,340 --> 00:44:00,150
and I was like, oh, I really want that
data. I'm going to ask him for it. Uh,

725
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:02,790
because I want to know, like,
was it interesting to people?

726
00:44:02,791 --> 00:44:06,450
What topics didn't they like? Like, did
we come off as authentic or inauthentic?

727
00:44:06,451 --> 00:44:07,950
Like where were we?
Um,

728
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:13,880
but it's funny because no one ever tells
you anything and it's unless you dig

729
00:44:14,581 --> 00:44:16,530
for it, you won't find it. Um,

730
00:44:17,310 --> 00:44:20,340
but honestly I think letting people
know that it's safe to give feedback,

731
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:24,990
asking for a proactively, et Cetera,
et Cetera is important. I just,

732
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:30,060
the amount of people go out of their way
to avoid conflict is pretty wild. Yeah.

733
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:31,290
Which,
which

734
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:33,660
often works in the short term,

735
00:44:33,661 --> 00:44:38,661
but can really be caustic and road
relationships in the longterm.

736
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:41,650
And if you're avoiding that,
and you,

737
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:46,380
your comment on the rating on
screen made me think of, uh,

738
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:50,940
Kyle Maynard, who is an
incredible, incredible guy who's a,

739
00:44:50,941 --> 00:44:54,960
I was also been on the bad guys,
but he had learned at one point,

740
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:58,650
or it was given a piece of advice from
a very successful CEO of a large company

741
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:03,180
that if you ever asked somebody to write
something from one to 10 to disallow

742
00:45:03,181 --> 00:45:04,830
seven,
because seven's,

743
00:45:04,831 --> 00:45:08,730
it's like semi is all three and
a half stars. You're like, yeah,

744
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:11,430
exactly.
So you mentioned restaurants.

745
00:45:11,431 --> 00:45:14,190
So it will very often ask people in
restaurants if they're giving me the,

746
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:19,170
everything is good response, which
is gives me no information to act on.

747
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,230
As I'll say. All right. On any,

748
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:26,940
I'll give them two options and I'll say
one to 10, but no, seven. How do you rank?

749
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:28,770
And it's, it's sort of bear. Then they,

750
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:32,670
they're forced if they're straddling
that to do a barely pass, which is a sec.

751
00:45:32,671 --> 00:45:35,430
So I'm not going to order that or an
eight, which is a strong, that's a,

752
00:45:35,530 --> 00:45:40,530
that's a confident endorsement and a
suit that can be applied to all manner of

753
00:45:42,151 --> 00:45:46,410
things. Uh, that's a really cool, I'll
do that from now on. You know, sevens.

754
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:50,780
Yeah, let's, let's talk
about tough times. Uh,

755
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:54,760
so you mentioned are none. The life of
an entrepreneur is golden. True. It's,

756
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:57,870
you know, it's, it has been, uh,

757
00:45:59,010 --> 00:46:02,730
it has been said that your life is
all highlights. No, I'm kidding.

758
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:05,640
That hasn't been said. A company
made that happen, but I want it to,

759
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:06,870
I want to talk about,

760
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:12,150
I want to talk about some of the
maybe tougher times that, uh,

761
00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:17,220
that you're willing to share, if any.
Some of the maybe course darker periods,

762
00:46:17,221 --> 00:46:18,840
tough decisions. We're, uh,

763
00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:23,530
anytime you had kind of self
doubt or felt lost because, uh,

764
00:46:23,570 --> 00:46:24,670
and where I'm going with this,

765
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:29,690
I'm very curious how you
then recontextualized it
found the silver lining or

766
00:46:30,691 --> 00:46:34,380
just got through it. Um, because it's, uh,

767
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:37,590
some people get knocked down and they
have a really tough time getting back up.

768
00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:40,050
So when people are able to do that,
I like to look,

769
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:43,680
look inside and see what actually
happened. Yeah. So, yeah. Any,

770
00:46:43,681 --> 00:46:45,210
any at all that you're
willing to talk about?

771
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:50,750
First thing I'll say is a lot of people
assume that like business people,

772
00:46:51,151 --> 00:46:51,984
entrepreneurs,

773
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:56,010
like whether they make money like a lot
of money or they saw a company or they

774
00:46:56,070 --> 00:47:00,360
go public or whatever and their CEO's for
a long time, or world leaders, whatever.

775
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:03,690
A lot of people assume these
people don't struggle, right.

776
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,850
That somehow they're inhuman or whatever.
Like,

777
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:10,800
I feel like I wake up every day with
a lot of the same worries I did before

778
00:47:10,801 --> 00:47:14,970
Instagram was a thing. Am I working on
the right thing? Did I do enough today?

779
00:47:14,971 --> 00:47:16,470
Is that idea of the right idea?

780
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:22,040
And I still have just as many failures
as I did before Instagram and well inside

781
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:24,210
of Instagram as well.
Now don't get me wrong,

782
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:27,600
there are structures around me now
that allow me to come back from those

783
00:47:27,601 --> 00:47:30,280
failures. Um, but

784
00:47:30,490 --> 00:47:35,490
I guess my point is like getting knocked
down is like a really common thing.

785
00:47:36,251 --> 00:47:38,800
No matter where you are in your career,

786
00:47:38,801 --> 00:47:43,000
no matter where you are in your
progress of building something.

787
00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:48,250
And in fact it usually happens more, the
more important thing you're doing. Right?

788
00:47:48,850 --> 00:47:51,570
So early on it Instagram,
uh,

789
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:57,190
I think there were a bunch of times I
remember pitching the idea and having

790
00:47:57,191 --> 00:47:58,390
really smart,

791
00:47:58,391 --> 00:48:02,770
intelligent folks look at me like I was
a crazy person for working on anything

792
00:48:02,771 --> 00:48:05,500
related to photos.
Um,

793
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:08,560
I remember trying to hire some of,

794
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:12,130
like the most amazing designers early on,
um,

795
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:15,100
who just like wouldn't join because
they didn't believe in the APP.

796
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:17,860
I remember press stories,
um,

797
00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:22,480
or investors investing in competitors
even though they had invested in us.

798
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:27,070
So choosing the other, which is
fine, listen, like it's up to like,

799
00:48:27,071 --> 00:48:29,200
investors should be able to choose
who they think the winner is.

800
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:33,970
That's their job. But it's tough, right?
To think you're not the winner. Um,

801
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:38,200
all of these things happened along the
way and we were knocked down multiple

802
00:48:38,201 --> 00:48:42,720
times. Um, whether that was in
our heads are actually there, uh,

803
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:45,100
in reality.
Um,

804
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:50,250
but the thing that kept us going was
realizing it wasn't other people we were

805
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:53,920
trying to impress. I mean, of course
we wanted a community for the APP.

806
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:57,360
The reason we got back up each and every
time it was because we loved what we're

807
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:58,780
doing,
right?

808
00:48:59,050 --> 00:49:02,440
Like if your goal is to
gain people's approval,

809
00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:06,580
like the startup business is a
terrible business to get into. Heck,

810
00:49:06,581 --> 00:49:10,130
like if you're a singer,
like the worst business to be in,

811
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:13,390
in the world because everyone's going to
tell you your stuff stinks until maybe

812
00:49:13,391 --> 00:49:16,540
it doesn't. Right. But you have
to believe in what you're doing.

813
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:17,800
I love what you're doing.

814
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:22,060
That itself has to bring you
the most amount of excitement.

815
00:49:22,990 --> 00:49:25,390
Otherwise getting knocked down is going
to knock you off the horse and you're

816
00:49:25,391 --> 00:49:27,750
off forever.
And I,

817
00:49:27,751 --> 00:49:32,751
I often think like was it determination
that got us to where we got or luck or

818
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:38,050
some combination of both of them because
I don't know if you have a bad idea and

819
00:49:38,051 --> 00:49:42,100
you're determined on it and don't listen
to anyone, it's like not great. Right?

820
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:46,990
Yeah. But at the same time we wouldn't
be where we are if I had listened to most

821
00:49:46,991 --> 00:49:50,680
people. It's crazy. Yeah. So, um,

822
00:49:51,790 --> 00:49:56,440
I dunno if there's a secret to getting
back up otherwise other than maybe

823
00:49:56,441 --> 00:50:00,490
creating no choice but to get back up.
Like I didn't have another job.

824
00:50:00,491 --> 00:50:03,550
What was I going to do? Like sign up
for business school. I don't know.

825
00:50:03,551 --> 00:50:08,260
Like I had quit my job and raised a bunch
of money and I really loved what I was

826
00:50:08,261 --> 00:50:11,170
doing. So every time one of
these failures would occur.

827
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:16,540
What was the other option? Can you
think of one? A desk, job, desk, job.

828
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:22,450
Can you think of an example?
Uh, of a tough time,

829
00:50:22,451 --> 00:50:27,120
a tough decision,
a tough rejection from an investor,

830
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:28,310
a designer,
anything.

831
00:50:28,310 --> 00:50:32,110
And what you then said to yourself,

832
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:35,080
I'm very curious about self
talk. Right? So it's like,

833
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:39,260
whether it's like Shaun white on
the final run in the Olympics.

834
00:50:39,261 --> 00:50:42,640
And I asked him what he said before he
left the gate to himself and it was who

835
00:50:42,641 --> 00:50:45,010
cares? And he like explained
why it was like, who cares?

836
00:50:45,011 --> 00:50:49,540
And I didn't expect that answer
and found it really interesting.

837
00:50:49,541 --> 00:50:52,210
I mean in the sense that like he's done
all the preparation he could possibly do.

838
00:50:52,211 --> 00:50:56,740
He's either ready or he isn't. And
there was an entire explanation for it.

839
00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:01,950
Uh, and what fighters say
before they get in the ring.

840
00:51:01,951 --> 00:51:03,730
If there is some type of self talk.

841
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:08,150
I got one. Yeah. Yeah. Let's go
straight to the interesting topics.

842
00:51:08,151 --> 00:51:09,530
Selling our company.
Yeah.

843
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:14,150
So we sold our company
and it was April of 2012.

844
00:51:15,350 --> 00:51:19,470
Um, and by all accounts,
if you start a company, uh,

845
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:23,600
for a lot of entrepreneurs winning
quote unquote, and by the way,

846
00:51:23,601 --> 00:51:25,880
I don't agree with this
definition, but, um,

847
00:51:26,270 --> 00:51:30,890
but winning is quote unquote either
selling or company or, or, uh, you know,

848
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,630
having a public offering, an IPO. Um,

849
00:51:34,670 --> 00:51:39,020
for a lot of people that's like the
traditional outcome for a startup.

850
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:43,640
Um, and we had sold and we were
13 people and it was $1 billion.

851
00:51:43,641 --> 00:51:46,340
It was really exciting. And, uh,

852
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:51,660
and I remember like right
afterwards everyone being like,

853
00:51:52,581 --> 00:51:53,630
so it's over.

854
00:51:55,370 --> 00:52:00,370
And I feel like that was the most
painful thing to hear because I had no

855
00:52:01,281 --> 00:52:04,850
intention on not doing Instagram.

856
00:52:04,851 --> 00:52:08,690
I like wanted to work on it for
the next, you know, whatever years.

857
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:14,240
But everyone I met was like, so
you're done now, so it's over.

858
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:15,950
It was like, no, no, no, no, no.

859
00:52:16,310 --> 00:52:20,510
And like we would try to hire people
and they'd be like, no, it's over.

860
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:24,920
And I remember people working at
the company telling me it was over.

861
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:29,090
And a couple of people ended up
leaving pretty soon after that. Um,

862
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:33,530
and I remember one of them saying, yeah,
there's like nothing else to learn here.

863
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:38,600
I like, where can we go from here?
Mind you, at the time we had,

864
00:52:38,601 --> 00:52:42,950
I don't know, 50 million users. We got to
a billion by the way. We had no revenue.

865
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:46,640
We got to a lot more than no revenue.
Um,

866
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:49,220
we grew to a thousand people on the team.

867
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:53,930
We opened up multiple offices all around
the world. I got to do everything.

868
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:58,850
We're meeting the pope to meetings
some idols like I got to, it was crazy.

869
00:52:59,450 --> 00:53:03,680
So the idea that in 2012 we sold our
company and then everyone just kind of

870
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:08,180
counted us out. That was painful.
W W how did you contend with that?

871
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:11,510
Like what was your response to that?
I think with me,

872
00:53:11,511 --> 00:53:14,900
it usually comes with the competitive
nature of proving people wrong.

873
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:18,410
If you look at that like histogram,
sorry to use that word,

874
00:53:18,411 --> 00:53:22,400
but of how long founders stay
after they sell their company.

875
00:53:22,401 --> 00:53:27,401
I'm pretty sure there's like a giant
like lump around one month to one year.

876
00:53:27,690 --> 00:53:28,523
Right?

877
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:32,820
We were there for six years after we sold,

878
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:38,210
which I think goes to show how incredibly
determined we were to show people that

879
00:53:38,761 --> 00:53:42,510
Instagram wasn't done, that we
were at the beginning, not the end,

880
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:45,060
and that it didn't matter
if we sold the company,

881
00:53:45,061 --> 00:53:48,780
we were going to make something
out of this thing. And for me,

882
00:53:48,781 --> 00:53:52,950
I think the motivation comes
with proving people wrong. Um,

883
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:55,110
because I hate when people discount us.

884
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:59,040
I hate when people tell us we're not
going to be something that you know,

885
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:03,080
that because we've sold it's all over.
Uh,

886
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:05,640
but looking from the outset,
I get their perspective.

887
00:54:05,641 --> 00:54:09,480
I just wanted to prove them wrong.
Yeah. Yeah. It's a powerful motivator.

888
00:54:11,070 --> 00:54:12,030
Yeah.
I think,

889
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:16,770
and part of taking that personality test
we talked about is understanding what

890
00:54:16,771 --> 00:54:19,530
your motivators are because if
you know what your motivators are,

891
00:54:19,531 --> 00:54:22,490
then you know how to get
yourself up in the morning.

892
00:54:22,491 --> 00:54:25,800
How to work hard and had it right. And
you know what, things are not motivating,

893
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:30,880
but competition is one actually it's
interesting. There are two dimensions, uh,

894
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:34,740
of the personality test. There's
competition and then there's challenge.

895
00:54:34,770 --> 00:54:37,350
And I didn't,
I always thought it was competitive.

896
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:39,630
It turns out I'm actually
not competitive at all.

897
00:54:39,631 --> 00:54:41,610
I mean I'm a little competitive
but not that competitive.

898
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:45,270
I have very high scores on challenge,

899
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:48,690
which means setting goals for
yourself and trying to meet them.

900
00:54:48,691 --> 00:54:51,450
But it's like self imposed
rather than comparative.

901
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:55,320
Writes it in sort of
an intrinsic motivator.

902
00:54:55,350 --> 00:54:58,320
It's an internal motivator of like,
I want to go get this thing done.

903
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:01,350
So for me,

904
00:55:01,351 --> 00:55:06,351
I think at that moment it was more about
self challenge to prove to myself that

905
00:55:06,691 --> 00:55:10,590
I could do it. Um, and that
we could build this thing. Um,

906
00:55:12,070 --> 00:55:15,990
it worked.
How did you learn to manage?

907
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:20,970
Uh, that's, that's a man and I had to,
yeah. So how does one learn to manage?

908
00:55:20,971 --> 00:55:25,320
Because you, and it's not just time
within a larger company, right?

909
00:55:25,321 --> 00:55:26,520
Because you can,

910
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:31,050
you can find plenty of people who make
the same mistakes for 20 years in a row.

911
00:55:31,110 --> 00:55:31,680
Yeah.

912
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:36,680
And somehow managed to limp along
and sort of do decently despite their

913
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:37,381
weaknesses.

914
00:55:37,381 --> 00:55:42,060
But when you sold the company,

915
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,460
how many employees do you have?
13.

916
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:48,600
13 and then I think I managed
like three of them. Right.

917
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:53,610
So you then went through, why do you
think of companies have hierarchy?

918
00:55:54,030 --> 00:55:55,320
They're like,
I don't want to manage people.

919
00:55:55,321 --> 00:55:58,200
You manage them and before you know
it you've got like a tree, you know,

920
00:55:58,201 --> 00:56:00,960
90 layers deep on joking.
Well, I'd be, I don't,

921
00:56:00,961 --> 00:56:04,320
I mean there is some truth to that I
think. But how did you learn to manage?

922
00:56:04,321 --> 00:56:08,790
Where there any particular
lessons? Resources. Um,

923
00:56:09,830 --> 00:56:14,330
so I have to say anything at all while
I was going to say my job was different

924
00:56:14,331 --> 00:56:16,670
than most, which obviously is
an understatement, but like

925
00:56:18,890 --> 00:56:22,720
I'm going to tell you the philosophy I
subscribe to and then I think you're,

926
00:56:22,730 --> 00:56:25,840
the listeners can decide if it
makes sense for them. It might.

927
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:31,060
I decided that I had
nothing to lose because,

928
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:34,990
or at least I didn't think I had anything
to lose. Um, because I had my job,

929
00:56:35,050 --> 00:56:36,070
I was excited about it.

930
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:41,100
I was running this thing and I knew what
I didn't know or at least knew that I

931
00:56:41,651 --> 00:56:42,820
didn't know a bunch of stuff.

932
00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:48,570
My philosophy was hiring the smartest
possible people were way better than me,

933
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:54,220
um, to work for me. And that feels weird
because you're like, I have no experience.

934
00:56:54,221 --> 00:56:55,660
I've been doing this for two years.

935
00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:59,980
How do I hire someone that has maybe 15
years of experience in the engineering

936
00:56:59,981 --> 00:57:04,570
or 15 in, you know, operations
or the list goes on.

937
00:57:05,430 --> 00:57:06,263
Um,

938
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:11,340
but the ironic thing is by hiring
people that were way better than me,

939
00:57:12,010 --> 00:57:17,010
but like I would see myself working for
someday if they started a company that

940
00:57:18,251 --> 00:57:21,010
actually you end up creating
the best possible team.

941
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:25,930
And I think that works because
I felt like I had job security.

942
00:57:26,350 --> 00:57:30,550
So a lot of people are worried,
well if I hire great people beneath me,

943
00:57:30,970 --> 00:57:35,970
then then maybe one of them will
take my job and I don't know where,

944
00:57:37,150 --> 00:57:41,680
like the reality is on that spectrum in
the real world. Like I don't know. Um,

945
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:45,520
but I think that's actually one of the
issues I looked for most in the company,

946
00:57:45,521 --> 00:57:49,120
which was, um, people
hiring down on purpose.

947
00:57:49,690 --> 00:57:52,930
Like people do it reflexively,
they hire down, they're like, no,

948
00:57:52,931 --> 00:57:56,410
I need someone with less experience
than me who they should be younger.

949
00:57:56,411 --> 00:58:00,250
They should have less, fewer
years of experience. Right.
Cause I should coach them.

950
00:58:00,730 --> 00:58:02,380
And actually if everyone hired up,

951
00:58:02,410 --> 00:58:06,850
you'd have like the most bad ass company
in the world. So how do you manage that?

952
00:58:07,570 --> 00:58:11,950
I guess my point is I found people that
were way better than me and the way I

953
00:58:11,951 --> 00:58:15,760
managed was by managing the vision and
direction of the company and then asking

954
00:58:15,761 --> 00:58:20,020
those people how to get there and making
sure those two things were connected at

955
00:58:20,021 --> 00:58:23,790
all times. But I didn't have the
regular job of like, you know,

956
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:27,400
managing a bunch of new grads out of
college and like coaching them on their

957
00:58:27,401 --> 00:58:32,160
careers, um, which exists in
mass in Silicon Valley. Um,

958
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:36,970
so I'm not sure my management
like experience mirrored that,

959
00:58:37,030 --> 00:58:39,910
um, of most, but I think
there's a lot to learn,

960
00:58:39,911 --> 00:58:43,240
which is hire really great people
that someday you want to have,

961
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:44,620
they should have your job.

962
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:50,280
So you hire these people if you
subscribe to this philosophy.

963
00:58:51,330 --> 00:58:56,330
And then I imagine there are
different strategies and routines and

964
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:04,280
rules and so on that you put in place
to give structure and direction to this

965
00:59:05,731 --> 00:59:07,320
team of all stars.
And so,

966
00:59:07,321 --> 00:59:12,321
so one that I could ask about
would be meeting structure.

967
00:59:13,291 --> 00:59:18,060
So in the course of prepping for this,
a nice bound this a few places,

968
00:59:18,061 --> 00:59:22,700
but in the, in the New York Times,
feel free to fact check this, but,

969
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:24,940
uh, I'll just read this
briefly and then making,

970
00:59:24,950 --> 00:59:29,950
I'd love to hear you elaborate on what
the meeting actually looks like and,

971
00:59:30,070 --> 00:59:33,110
and how, how you handle it. So some of
the bottlenecks, this is from their time,

972
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:35,360
some of the bottlenecks the company is
addressing the law in the past year,

973
00:59:35,361 --> 00:59:36,620
our internal,
for example,

974
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:40,130
Mister sister man is cofounder realized
that one of the primary holdups was

975
00:59:40,131 --> 00:59:41,150
their own decision making.

976
00:59:41,150 --> 00:59:43,790
So in the past three months they started
holding meetings in which they just

977
00:59:43,791 --> 00:59:47,060
make a bunch of decisions and
then this is quoting Mr System.

978
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:51,050
We have a dock in which we list out the
inventory of decisions on products as if

979
00:59:51,051 --> 00:59:53,480
it's stacked up in front of the
machine waiting to be processed.

980
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:56,990
Mr System said and then we have sessions
where we sit down and we'd decide you

981
00:59:56,991 --> 00:59:58,400
just work through the decisions.

982
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:03,890
So this is something that you
might be able to do in an informal,

983
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:08,060
unmatched way when you have three
direct reports or 13 employees,

984
01:00:08,061 --> 01:00:13,061
but as it grows it seems like this
type of systematizing could be really

985
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:16,370
important.
Can you describe

986
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:22,300
how a meeting like this functioned?
Totally and why names?

987
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:27,550
It's really funny for me to think of
myself as being a referenced as mister

988
01:00:27,551 --> 01:00:31,030
sister. It's very, it's, it's very formal,

989
01:00:31,090 --> 01:00:35,320
Mr System with inventory
of decisions. Um, okay.

990
01:00:35,321 --> 01:00:40,120
So here's the context. Have you ever had
the book the goal, the goal, their goal?

991
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:42,160
I have not. Yeah. Um,

992
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:47,400
it is a book about basically
manufacturing and supply chain management.

993
01:00:49,190 --> 01:00:52,660
It sounds really boring, but I
promise you it's really good. Um,

994
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:56,650
last name is gold rat. Uh, I
think it's cold, right? Yeah.

995
01:00:56,680 --> 01:01:01,090
Who wrote the book and it's kind of an,
in fact, if you talk to business people,

996
01:01:01,091 --> 01:01:03,010
a lot of people will say
it's their favorite book.

997
01:01:03,011 --> 01:01:05,680
Like I wrote in one of my
weekly updates to the team.

998
01:01:05,710 --> 01:01:07,690
I wrote that I was reading
this book and that I loved it.

999
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:10,990
And a bunch of people were
like, Oh, I love that book too.

1000
01:01:11,170 --> 01:01:15,940
So it's a business book that talks
about how to optimize a supply chains

1001
01:01:15,941 --> 01:01:20,170
basically. Um, but it's
written in narrative form,

1002
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:25,180
which is kind of cheeky, right?
It's, it's not like a business,

1003
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:27,910
it's a business book,
but it's written with a narrative.

1004
01:01:27,940 --> 01:01:32,200
Like there are characters
and it's actually pretty fun.
So I say, go have a read.

1005
01:01:32,530 --> 01:01:33,363
Um,

1006
01:01:34,690 --> 01:01:38,470
but what I realized in
reading this was that, uh,

1007
01:01:38,710 --> 01:01:42,070
any system is most constrained,

1008
01:01:42,071 --> 01:01:47,071
or at least the thesis of the book is
most constrained by the slowest process.

1009
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:52,950
Um, I think they called it
a Herbie. Herbie, have you
ever heard that? I have, yes.

1010
01:01:53,190 --> 01:01:56,260
Because the beginning of the book kind
of like boy scouts. Yeah, exactly.

1011
01:01:56,261 --> 01:01:59,530
If you want to explain what it is,
I know we're getting there. Um,

1012
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:04,620
how many times are boy scouts going to
come up in a podcast? Right. So, uh,

1013
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:08,410
the narrative is that they're on some
trip and they like have these, uh,

1014
01:02:08,470 --> 01:02:10,630
boy scouts lined up. I
think it's like, you know,

1015
01:02:10,631 --> 01:02:14,440
the main character's son or something is,
was in the line of boy scouts and a,

1016
01:02:14,450 --> 01:02:17,020
and Herbie,
it might not be PC to talk about now,

1017
01:02:17,021 --> 01:02:21,600
but urby is a little overweight and he's
at, I see at the back, I don't know.

1018
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:23,220
Basically they figure,
I think it,

1019
01:02:23,221 --> 01:02:26,100
the way it goes is no matter
where they put him in the line,

1020
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:29,730
the line can only move as
fast as the slowest process.

1021
01:02:29,731 --> 01:02:33,690
That's kind of the takeaway. Okay.
Um, again, people who are super fans,

1022
01:02:33,730 --> 01:02:38,190
the goal can correct me on this,
but the essence of it is your slowest,

1023
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:42,740
um, your slowest part in the chain
is always going to limit output.

1024
01:02:42,930 --> 01:02:47,370
In this case, the slowest boy scout
limits the progress the troop makes, um,

1025
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:50,320
which isn't actually all that,
um,

1026
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:55,470
isn't all that intuitive until you
read this book and you go through it.

1027
01:02:56,040 --> 01:03:00,300
So with decision making, what we realize
is a lot of things were coming to us,

1028
01:03:00,630 --> 01:03:05,340
but unless we would decide on an important
decision, it was basically like, uh,

1029
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:10,460
inventory stacking up in front
of a machine that wasn't moving.

1030
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:11,760
And of course,

1031
01:03:11,790 --> 01:03:16,790
the machine can output
products that people want to
go use until those decisions

1032
01:03:17,341 --> 01:03:20,490
get made. So it sounds,
again, really intuitive,

1033
01:03:20,790 --> 01:03:24,180
but if you think about a company as,
you know,

1034
01:03:24,390 --> 01:03:27,780
the raw materials go in and
raw materials or ideas, okay.

1035
01:03:28,230 --> 01:03:32,820
And they go through machines
that transform them into reality.

1036
01:03:32,821 --> 01:03:37,410
So they go from an idea to a mock
to, uh, you know, uh, a final, uh,

1037
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,510
final draft to aversion,

1038
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:43,260
to out testing with Beta testers
out to the real world. That,

1039
01:03:43,261 --> 01:03:47,610
actually what you need to do is make
sure all machines are running at highest

1040
01:03:47,611 --> 01:03:48,151
capacity,

1041
01:03:48,151 --> 01:03:53,151
including the one that moves ideas from
the idea pile to mocks from mocks to

1042
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:55,500
actual.
Right.

1043
01:03:55,560 --> 01:04:00,070
So you worked on the chain and
we realized very early on, um,

1044
01:04:01,020 --> 01:04:04,650
in reading this book that a lot of
the lessons that usually applied to

1045
01:04:04,651 --> 01:04:07,860
manufacturing actually apply to
making decisions at a company as well.

1046
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:10,560
I had actually forgotten about
that book until you mentioned it.

1047
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:15,160
I'll have to pick it
up. Yeah. The goal, uh,

1048
01:04:15,450 --> 01:04:18,060
of a long list of books to tackle.

1049
01:04:18,061 --> 01:04:19,890
How do you choose books that
you're going to read it?

1050
01:04:19,891 --> 01:04:24,670
I know you've given a few examples of
things that you're interested in, uh,

1051
01:04:24,810 --> 01:04:29,810
but how do you filter the universe
of books to those who end up reading?

1052
01:04:29,941 --> 01:04:33,480
And I mean, you can maybe just pull up,
you could pull a few real examples from,

1053
01:04:34,410 --> 01:04:38,610
from uh, those you've read and it
can indicate how you got to those.

1054
01:04:38,611 --> 01:04:42,420
But is do you have a process for
selecting books? Well, first, uh,

1055
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:45,600
or describe doing well
first I don't read fiction.

1056
01:04:45,870 --> 01:04:47,790
Not that there's anything
wrong with fiction.

1057
01:04:47,791 --> 01:04:51,510
And I know people that read a lot will
be like, what? You don't read fiction?

1058
01:04:51,511 --> 01:04:53,040
Come on, there's so many
grades. I don't know,

1059
01:04:53,041 --> 01:04:56,820
it just doesn't get me up in the morning.
So, uh, there we go. There it goes,

1060
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:01,350
you know, a good portion of books, uh,
down to nonfiction, nonfiction books.

1061
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:07,190
Then I asked myself what topics I care
deeply about or what things I really want

1062
01:05:07,191 --> 01:05:10,590
to learn. So for instance,
learning to fly like, okay,

1063
01:05:10,591 --> 01:05:14,010
what are the best books
to learn to fly? Or, uh,

1064
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:17,290
if I want to learn about investing
or finance, what are the best books?

1065
01:05:17,291 --> 01:05:20,110
Or if I want to learn about productivity,
what are the best books?

1066
01:05:20,470 --> 01:05:24,160
And obviously Amazon is great for that
and you can read through reviews and, um,

1067
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:27,520
but honestly a big part of
me reading is just like,

1068
01:05:27,521 --> 01:05:31,390
there's usually some outcome I want.
Like I want to be able to do x,

1069
01:05:31,630 --> 01:05:36,190
what do I have to read that will
teach me as fast as possible?

1070
01:05:36,220 --> 01:05:39,340
Because like with a book. Okay.
So with a class you got to like,

1071
01:05:39,341 --> 01:05:41,380
wait until the class happens,

1072
01:05:41,381 --> 01:05:44,110
go to the class and then wait
until the next class with a book,

1073
01:05:44,111 --> 01:05:47,740
you can literally like just get
through it in a week or a day or,

1074
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:52,630
and then you can reread it and reread
it. And I just, I find that like,

1075
01:05:52,631 --> 01:05:54,010
if you want to learn a new skill,

1076
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:58,630
there's nothing like sitting down with
a nonfiction book on that topic that's

1077
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:02,980
uh, you know, well laid out
and, but sometimes, you know,

1078
01:06:03,010 --> 01:06:04,390
you got to call it,
I've,

1079
01:06:04,450 --> 01:06:07,810
I've been a quarter way through a bunch
of books on topics that I thought I was

1080
01:06:07,811 --> 01:06:11,760
going to like and just throwing them
out because I'm like to the trash. Uh,

1081
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:15,580
so they don't, it doesn't always
work that way. Do you read, uh,

1082
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:19,870
and if you don't, this isn't a
value judgment, uh, biographies.

1083
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:24,850
Do you ever read biographies?
Okay. So, um, I have not read,

1084
01:06:25,810 --> 01:06:28,420
no, but I really want to. Okay.

1085
01:06:28,421 --> 01:06:32,890
So the one area that I want to
spend way more time on his history,

1086
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:37,210
including biographies, which I
consider a form of history. Um,

1087
01:06:38,650 --> 01:06:42,340
although biographies can be fairly
selective in the history they tell that's

1088
01:06:42,341 --> 01:06:45,520
true of all history books.
Um, I feel like their

1089
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:52,210
holiday, you a 41. Pretty sure I'm 41.
That's okay. We'll fact check that one.

1090
01:06:52,211 --> 01:06:55,780
I'll get back to, uh, I'm 35. Okay. Uh,

1091
01:06:56,320 --> 01:07:00,150
our lives are really short
compared to the history, uh,

1092
01:07:00,370 --> 01:07:04,660
recorded history and it turns
out if you look back in history,

1093
01:07:04,690 --> 01:07:08,740
things patterns emerge. I read this
great book called Lessons of history.

1094
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:13,070
I was just have you read it? Will and
Ariel, fantastic short. It's excellent.

1095
01:07:13,250 --> 01:07:16,510
It's like a leaflet. Like you
could read it in today. Great.

1096
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:18,730
There's some parts that I disagree with,

1097
01:07:18,731 --> 01:07:22,150
but for the most read that because Ray
Dalia recommended it. It's a great book.

1098
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:26,350
Yeah. Yeah. I, the number of people I
meet that are like, they've read it.

1099
01:07:26,351 --> 01:07:27,910
And anyway,

1100
01:07:28,150 --> 01:07:31,810
the takeaway is that things happen
over and over again or at least certain

1101
01:07:31,811 --> 01:07:36,790
patterns emerge. And I guess what I'm
saying is if you look back at history,

1102
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:40,750
you can learn a lot from
reading people's history,

1103
01:07:40,751 --> 01:07:45,751
whether it's a biography or a history
of a specific segment of companies.

1104
01:07:46,241 --> 01:07:47,350
So for instance,

1105
01:07:48,580 --> 01:07:53,140
I think if you want to study the
acquisitions of companies and where those

1106
01:07:53,141 --> 01:07:57,430
founders have gone and what they've done,
and more importantly,

1107
01:07:57,460 --> 01:08:01,780
what do most founders do
next after selling a company
and taking some months off?

1108
01:08:01,781 --> 01:08:05,230
How many take one month off? How many
take a year? How many take five years?

1109
01:08:05,231 --> 01:08:08,200
How many never emerge
again, right? Like, but how,

1110
01:08:08,260 --> 01:08:12,220
what are the differences between those
that decide to do something and those

1111
01:08:12,221 --> 01:08:16,280
that don't? So even in my own
exploration of what's next

1112
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:20,540
in my life, I find myself not
reading necessarily biographies,

1113
01:08:20,541 --> 01:08:22,940
but I do read accounts of,
you know,

1114
01:08:22,941 --> 01:08:26,030
entrepreneurs that have launched
big things and none, you know,

1115
01:08:26,031 --> 01:08:29,930
new things in the future and those who
haven't. And I started asking myself like,

1116
01:08:30,170 --> 01:08:34,100
what are the patterns that emerge?
So, no, I don't read biographies yet,

1117
01:08:34,101 --> 01:08:36,680
but I want to. And, uh, and history,

1118
01:08:36,681 --> 01:08:40,040
I think more generally is a
super interesting topic. Uh,

1119
01:08:40,590 --> 01:08:43,280
there's some excellent
biographies out there. Uh, I,

1120
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:48,020
I think you might enjoy a Gingiss Khan
and the making of the modern world. Okay.

1121
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:50,150
Excellent.
Excellent book for a lot of reasons.

1122
01:08:50,151 --> 01:08:54,910
I'm trying to think of the ones that
had been recommended to me. Um, yeah,

1123
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:55,940
I'll have to get back to you on that.

1124
01:08:55,941 --> 01:08:59,270
David McCullough has a lot of really
good biographies and the Wright brothers

1125
01:08:59,271 --> 01:09:03,990
and so on. Uh, it was actually given
to me by very, very successful, uh,

1126
01:09:04,310 --> 01:09:07,190
consumer packaged goods
entrepreneur here in Austin,

1127
01:09:07,191 --> 01:09:11,540
which turns out to be sort of ground zero
or the epicenter of a lot of CPG stuff.

1128
01:09:11,540 --> 01:09:12,500
So cool.
Yeah,

1129
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:16,520
but isn't it interesting how many people
have so many similar patterns in their

1130
01:09:16,521 --> 01:09:17,061
lives?

1131
01:09:17,061 --> 01:09:22,061
And I think there's this great equalizer
when you realize what you are doing or

1132
01:09:22,611 --> 01:09:24,430
going through or whatever.
Well,

1133
01:09:24,450 --> 01:09:28,520
it might be super unique to
you and you're 35 or 41 years.

1134
01:09:28,820 --> 01:09:32,240
It actually turns out like it happens
over and over again to people on their

1135
01:09:32,241 --> 01:09:33,830
lives. Not everyone, but like,

1136
01:09:33,860 --> 01:09:36,380
it's occurred in the past and
you have a lot to learn from it.

1137
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:40,550
That's basically my point and that,
that I think it's 120 page book.

1138
01:09:40,610 --> 01:09:44,330
Lessons of history is fantastic
place to start. I expected it,

1139
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:49,360
I actually downloaded it as a kindle
book and let it sit there for months

1140
01:09:50,871 --> 01:09:55,310
because I expected it to be very dry
and it's a beautifully written book.

1141
01:09:55,370 --> 01:09:58,310
It's very impressed.
And then if you like that as a,

1142
01:09:58,311 --> 01:10:02,510
as a taste test and then you can go into
there, what is it like 10 or 20 volume,

1143
01:10:03,090 --> 01:10:06,640
uh, and said, look, he Demery of their
volumes, right? That's right. Yeah.

1144
01:10:06,641 --> 01:10:11,630
It's like the cliff notes the cliff.
Yeah. Okay. I'd like to ask you,

1145
01:10:11,860 --> 01:10:16,860
this is one of the questions that I had
been hoping to ask ever since we booked

1146
01:10:16,941 --> 01:10:17,774
the podcast.

1147
01:10:18,110 --> 01:10:23,110
And that is about advice that you give
to entrepreneurs that very few actually

1148
01:10:23,541 --> 01:10:28,040
take.
And I'll explain just by way of example.

1149
01:10:29,030 --> 01:10:33,460
Uh, I'm asked all the time how, how, uh,

1150
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:37,130
various folks should launch books
where people come to me asking,

1151
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:39,200
how should I launch a book?
How should I write a book?

1152
01:10:39,201 --> 01:10:43,760
How should I get a book published?
And I might tell them,

1153
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:46,790
for instance,
don't try to write for the entire world.

1154
01:10:46,970 --> 01:10:49,280
If your goal is to hit the New
York Times bestseller list, right,

1155
01:10:49,281 --> 01:10:53,450
for like 10 to 20,000 people per week.
In other words,

1156
01:10:53,630 --> 01:10:57,350
you really only need to get the
flywheel spinning because people use the

1157
01:10:57,351 --> 01:11:00,110
bestseller list as a shopping list to,

1158
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:05,180
to write a book that at least
20,000 people will love,

1159
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:07,010
but they end up writing
something too general.

1160
01:11:07,070 --> 01:11:10,820
They end up writing something
to general. Uh, and uh,

1161
01:11:11,270 --> 01:11:16,270
I tell them to give a ton of buffer before
the book is published and to write it

1162
01:11:17,521 --> 01:11:18,780
in such a way that for instance,

1163
01:11:18,781 --> 01:11:22,110
it can be read modularly and then they
don't do that and they wonder why they

1164
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:26,640
can't run excerpts. Uh,
and, uh, it's, it's,

1165
01:11:26,940 --> 01:11:30,520
it's been incredible to me how,
and I put together a blog post,

1166
01:11:30,521 --> 01:11:33,300
which just like how to write a best
selling book this year where I lay out the

1167
01:11:33,301 --> 01:11:36,690
exact playlist, uh, or not
playlist rather, but play book.

1168
01:11:37,230 --> 01:11:39,180
And nonetheless,

1169
01:11:39,181 --> 01:11:43,920
it's like one out of a hundred who
actually implement even a portion of the

1170
01:11:43,921 --> 01:11:44,754
steps.

1171
01:11:45,450 --> 01:11:50,450
Are there any particular bits of advice
or recommendations that you give to

1172
01:11:50,461 --> 01:11:55,200
entrepreneurs that you're surprised
aren't taken more seriously or actually

1173
01:11:55,201 --> 01:11:56,400
followed?
Yeah,

1174
01:11:57,410 --> 01:12:01,190
number one advice I always
give is to solve a problem.

1175
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:05,670
So many people, uh, when
they found a company,

1176
01:12:05,671 --> 01:12:10,550
you found a company just to found a
company or they're like, I've got an idea,

1177
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:14,960
ideas are not companies. Ideas are
not products. Like you're like,

1178
01:12:14,961 --> 01:12:18,440
well I'm going to combine this thing with
this trend and we're going to do this.

1179
01:12:18,470 --> 01:12:21,530
It's a cool idea.
And you know,

1180
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:26,560
usually the warning signs
are that includes some
element of a current fad like

1181
01:12:28,371 --> 01:12:31,700
AI or something. Not that AI
is a fad, but like, you know,

1182
01:12:31,701 --> 01:12:36,230
it's a wave that's happening right now
that I think it's easy to make your

1183
01:12:36,260 --> 01:12:37,880
company somewhere interesting
if you're just like,

1184
01:12:37,910 --> 01:12:42,910
and it uses AI or like crypto or like
there always warning signs that I see with

1185
01:12:45,771 --> 01:12:46,790
the pitches that I,

1186
01:12:46,791 --> 01:12:51,770
that I hear from people when they include
those words and it's not backed up by

1187
01:12:51,771 --> 01:12:55,670
a clear problem that you're solving
for the person on the other side or the

1188
01:12:55,671 --> 01:12:59,120
company. On the other side,
the counterparty, right? Um,

1189
01:12:59,690 --> 01:13:03,350
so I always say, make sure you're
actually solving a problem.

1190
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:05,570
Now there are different
ways that can be wrong.

1191
01:13:05,630 --> 01:13:08,090
It could be solved already really well,

1192
01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:10,820
in which case you're not solving a
problem. The idea might be great,

1193
01:13:10,850 --> 01:13:11,990
but you're not solving a problem.

1194
01:13:12,710 --> 01:13:17,710
It can be a really neat idea with not a
lot of people that need that problem to

1195
01:13:18,771 --> 01:13:21,920
be solved, in which case it's not
really a problem for the world. Right?

1196
01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:25,850
Maybe we could broaden this by saying,
solve a problem for the world, um,

1197
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:29,660
or it just misunderstands
what people need.

1198
01:13:30,380 --> 01:13:33,680
Or it doesn't even take into account
what people need. You're just like, oh,

1199
01:13:33,681 --> 01:13:36,320
it sounds really cool. I'm going to
do this, this, and it's a hot market,

1200
01:13:36,321 --> 01:13:37,370
so I'm going to figure it out.

1201
01:13:38,210 --> 01:13:42,740
And the number of times I've seen
entrepreneurs go that direction because it

1202
01:13:42,741 --> 01:13:44,660
feels good to be part of the trend.

1203
01:13:44,660 --> 01:13:47,810
It feels good to see you have a
cool idea without asking yourself,

1204
01:13:47,811 --> 01:13:51,650
does this actually solve someone's
problem? Like, if I go talk to people,

1205
01:13:51,651 --> 01:13:55,880
it does this literally like relieve
people that this now exists.

1206
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:59,810
The number of times I've seen people
ignore this advice, it's countless.

1207
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:04,520
What's crazy to me is I feel like it's
our secret sauce at Instagram and I'm

1208
01:14:04,521 --> 01:14:07,880
like, this is great. Like we
can just keep doing this, right?

1209
01:14:07,881 --> 01:14:10,730
Like every product we work on
hopefully is solving someone's,

1210
01:14:11,740 --> 01:14:15,400
and I feel like I'm giving this advice
away for free, but no one's taking it.

1211
01:14:15,620 --> 01:14:18,910
That's, that's it's all also true
for nonfiction books, right? Yeah.

1212
01:14:18,970 --> 01:14:20,620
The number of books you
pick up and it's like,

1213
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:23,140
I bought the book because
I have the problem.

1214
01:14:23,170 --> 01:14:26,320
You don't have to spend 80% of the book
describing the problem. You got it.

1215
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:27,553
You got it.

1216
01:14:27,790 --> 01:14:28,623
Uh,

1217
01:14:29,310 --> 01:14:34,310
what are other common mistakes that you
observe among entrepreneurs or creators?

1218
01:14:36,390 --> 01:14:39,240
So we can make it, make it broader.
It doesn't have to be broader,

1219
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:44,040
but people who are trying to do their
own thing, entrepreneurs or otherwise,

1220
01:14:44,330 --> 01:14:47,220
uh, what are some common mistakes
you see? And it could be,

1221
01:14:47,221 --> 01:14:49,620
it could be within the
venture back startup world,

1222
01:14:49,621 --> 01:14:51,570
but it could also be broader than that.

1223
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:56,690
I think going at it alone is often I
mistake and that doesn't mean you have to

1224
01:14:56,691 --> 01:15:00,770
have a cofounder,
but not having a team is a mistake.

1225
01:15:00,771 --> 01:15:03,800
I see a bunch of people feeling like,
Oh, I'm just going to do this by myself.

1226
01:15:03,801 --> 01:15:06,190
I'm just going to it.
Um,

1227
01:15:06,230 --> 01:15:08,780
there's an incredible power
and having people around you,

1228
01:15:09,020 --> 01:15:12,980
even individuals who are like maybe the
face of their company have an incredible

1229
01:15:12,981 --> 01:15:14,780
team around them.
Uh,

1230
01:15:14,810 --> 01:15:19,810
and I think trying to do it all yourself
is like not only a recipe for getting

1231
01:15:20,031 --> 01:15:23,690
it wrong, but also a recipe for not
being able to get back up. I mean,

1232
01:15:24,260 --> 01:15:25,940
how do you get up when
you get punched down?

1233
01:15:25,941 --> 01:15:29,090
We'll sometimes having someone else
in the room with you to be like, yeah,

1234
01:15:29,091 --> 01:15:32,570
let's get up and get them.
You know, it helps. Um,

1235
01:15:33,410 --> 01:15:35,930
I think that's a mistake.
I see a lot. But, uh,

1236
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:38,333
you know,

1237
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:43,690
the crazy thing is that having gone
through it and making mistakes yourself,

1238
01:15:43,750 --> 01:15:48,130
it's not clear to me that like those are
all mistakes and every other situation.

1239
01:15:48,131 --> 01:15:53,131
So I'm trying to be careful
in overprescribing my
situation because there are

1240
01:15:53,441 --> 01:15:55,220
counter examples as well.
Sure.

1241
01:15:57,200 --> 01:16:00,040
That's the really important
point actually, uh,

1242
01:16:00,980 --> 01:16:04,910
that I think is worth underscoring
for folks. And that is for,

1243
01:16:05,180 --> 01:16:08,390
for nearly every rule that
someone might prescribe,

1244
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:12,800
there's probably a counter example,
you know,

1245
01:16:12,801 --> 01:16:17,540
the se leader of which would prescribe
the exact opposite. Yeah. Right.

1246
01:16:17,630 --> 01:16:20,360
And so it's, it's, I
suppose in part finding

1247
01:16:21,980 --> 01:16:25,370
the rules that are compatible also with,
uh,

1248
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:30,520
what you hold to be the core values
or philosophies that guide you.

1249
01:16:31,461 --> 01:16:35,510
Like being passionate about the product
or the service with the company.

1250
01:16:35,511 --> 01:16:39,590
Because that has some real practical
implications. If you're not passionate,

1251
01:16:40,700 --> 01:16:44,150
are you in fact going to be able to
summon the endurance, like you said,

1252
01:16:44,630 --> 01:16:49,340
to sort of walk through or around or
climb over the various walls are gonna pop

1253
01:16:49,341 --> 01:16:52,580
up? Probably not. Right. So
then you can find the examples.

1254
01:16:52,581 --> 01:16:56,330
It's sort of suit your personality in
the set of values that you've set out for

1255
01:16:56,331 --> 01:16:59,630
a given company. Uh, what, this is,

1256
01:16:59,690 --> 01:17:01,970
this is a metaphor question,

1257
01:17:01,971 --> 01:17:05,630
but if you could just a few more
questions and then we'll, we'll wrap up.

1258
01:17:07,220 --> 01:17:08,870
If you could put a,

1259
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:14,390
a quote, a word, a question, anything
noncommercial on a billboard.

1260
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:18,050
And really what I'm asking is to
get a message to billions of people,

1261
01:17:18,051 --> 01:17:21,470
which is crazy to think that you,
you can't actually do that now.

1262
01:17:21,471 --> 01:17:24,590
And so they supply forums
like, like Instagram. Uh,

1263
01:17:24,830 --> 01:17:29,830
but to get a message simultaneously to
billions of people could be an image.

1264
01:17:30,460 --> 01:17:34,940
What, what might you put on
that billboard? I don't know
if it sounds cheesy, but,

1265
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:35,390
uh,

1266
01:17:35,390 --> 01:17:40,390
the advice that I got that has driven me
the entire way is follow your passion.

1267
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:46,420
Like I cared so deeply about social
media and so deeply about photography and

1268
01:17:47,511 --> 01:17:51,320
there are so many people that were like,
social media is crowded,

1269
01:17:51,350 --> 01:17:55,820
photography is lame. You
know what I mean? That like,

1270
01:17:56,630 --> 01:18:00,410
the only way to get through those is
by loving the thing or the mission that

1271
01:18:00,411 --> 01:18:04,610
you're on. And, well, it again,

1272
01:18:04,611 --> 01:18:05,840
it sounds kind of cheesy.

1273
01:18:05,870 --> 01:18:08,480
Maybe we could wordsmith is
follow your passion and thing,

1274
01:18:08,481 --> 01:18:12,260
but like the number of people that don't
follow their passion because people

1275
01:18:12,261 --> 01:18:16,020
talk them out of it and I
think that's a crime right. At

1276
01:18:17,570 --> 01:18:22,070
of course you can't follow your passion
and not expect consequences. Like, listen,

1277
01:18:22,071 --> 01:18:26,330
if you're passionate is to go fly fishing
and you want to do that all the time,

1278
01:18:26,331 --> 01:18:30,800
that's great. But you often
know, okay, like can I pay
my bills? Right? Like can I,

1279
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:33,050
there are,
there are constraints,

1280
01:18:33,740 --> 01:18:37,700
but if you've thought
through it and you love it,

1281
01:18:37,730 --> 01:18:40,100
there should be no one's
standing in your way. Yeah.

1282
01:18:40,780 --> 01:18:43,070
And like the number of people
that tried to stand in our way,

1283
01:18:43,071 --> 01:18:47,990
like they still like listen, even long
into Instagram, there were people,

1284
01:18:48,020 --> 01:18:52,610
you know, predicting our demise. And so,
I don't know, like at a certain point,

1285
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:56,120
it's not like ignore the
haters. That could be the
other billboard by the way. Um,

1286
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:59,900
it's, it's like you've got
to follow your passion.

1287
01:19:00,490 --> 01:19:04,040
As long as you've thought through it,
you've done the math, you think about it,

1288
01:19:04,041 --> 01:19:07,470
like go for it. And don't let people
stand in your way. You know, like,

1289
01:19:08,210 --> 01:19:12,970
it's just so sad when people don't
do that and life is short. Uh,

1290
01:19:13,070 --> 01:19:13,581
like you said,

1291
01:19:13,581 --> 01:19:17,300
I mean our lives are so short relative
to sort of the span of human history.

1292
01:19:17,301 --> 01:19:21,140
And I think that's another benefit
of reading history is it puts that in

1293
01:19:21,141 --> 01:19:24,290
perspective.
Like these lives are sort of the deep,

1294
01:19:25,700 --> 01:19:29,540
the flicker of I think in Novell brava
competence and like the flicker of a

1295
01:19:29,541 --> 01:19:34,160
firefly in the sort of scope of,
of history. It's really short,

1296
01:19:34,370 --> 01:19:38,480
really tiny. And I had this, uh,

1297
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:41,840
this one coach who said to me,
he's like,

1298
01:19:41,841 --> 01:19:46,841
often people wake up when they have
someone close to them that dies or um,

1299
01:19:49,070 --> 01:19:53,150
or they come down with some really
serious illness and they realize all the

1300
01:19:53,151 --> 01:19:58,151
little things they were spending all
this time worried about don't matter

1301
01:19:58,370 --> 01:20:02,210
compared to these like
grave big things in life.

1302
01:20:02,990 --> 01:20:04,550
And it's important to
keep that perspective.

1303
01:20:04,551 --> 01:20:06,770
So I'm not trying to get
all like serious here,

1304
01:20:06,771 --> 01:20:11,771
but I think it's really important
to keep things in perspective.

1305
01:20:11,850 --> 01:20:16,530
And I think that, I dunno, like I guess
it's another word for maturity, right?

1306
01:20:17,070 --> 01:20:19,500
But, um, the faster you can get there,

1307
01:20:19,501 --> 01:20:24,330
the faster you realize a lot of what
you think matters doesn't matter.

1308
01:20:25,290 --> 01:20:29,580
And the things that you're not thinking
about matter a lot more than you're

1309
01:20:29,581 --> 01:20:31,260
giving them credit for.
Um,

1310
01:20:32,670 --> 01:20:36,330
which is why you should follow your
passion and love what you do every day.

1311
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:40,140
Don't get me wrong, by the way, I want
to clarify. A lot of people are like,

1312
01:20:40,141 --> 01:20:43,110
you should love what you
do. And I agree, but I,

1313
01:20:43,111 --> 01:20:47,030
I think it's more you should love
what you're shooting for. Yeah.

1314
01:20:47,070 --> 01:20:51,120
Because work is hard. Yeah. It
can be miserable at times. I mean,

1315
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:54,090
nothing great in this
world ever came easy.

1316
01:20:54,090 --> 01:20:57,650
Like if you want to be
an amazing guitarist,

1317
01:20:57,670 --> 01:21:02,250
you're not going to get there easily.
A Trane really hard get shot down a bunch,

1318
01:21:02,251 --> 01:21:04,170
right?
Like they're all like,

1319
01:21:04,171 --> 01:21:08,220
it's a universal law in the world that
great things come with a lot of work.

1320
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:13,760
And what you have to do is I think love
the thing you're shooting for rather

1321
01:21:13,891 --> 01:21:16,980
than the everyday of the thing. But
I think a lot of people are like, oh,

1322
01:21:16,990 --> 01:21:19,800
I should love every day. It's
like, no, no. Everyday it can be,

1323
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:21,390
there are a lot of hard days ahead.

1324
01:21:21,830 --> 01:21:26,830
The thing that gets you through those
days is loving the outcome you're shooting

1325
01:21:27,421 --> 01:21:31,380
for and it,
and being excited to get there Sunday.

1326
01:21:32,620 --> 01:21:33,050
Okay.

1327
01:21:33,050 --> 01:21:37,850
Well, Kevin, I'm excited
to see what you hatch next.

1328
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:42,170
Thank you. Let's see if after you've
done your pattern recognition on this,

1329
01:21:42,380 --> 01:21:47,380
a Meta analysis of founders who do
various things at various points.

1330
01:21:47,660 --> 01:21:50,810
I'll be curious to see where
you end up. Uh, but uh,

1331
01:21:50,870 --> 01:21:55,220
do you have any closing remarks?
Anything you'd like to ask people to do?

1332
01:21:55,340 --> 01:22:00,080
Any thing at all that you'd like to
say before we wrap up? No pressure,

1333
01:22:00,081 --> 01:22:04,130
right. You don't get, you don't have to
ask all your friends about this podcast.

1334
01:22:04,820 --> 01:22:08,330
Perfect. I like that recommendation.
Awesome. Thanks for having me.

1335
01:22:08,331 --> 01:22:09,530
