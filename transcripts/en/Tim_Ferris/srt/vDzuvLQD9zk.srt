00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,360
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to
another episode of the Tim Ferriss show.

2
00:00:03,361 --> 00:00:04,260
This is Tim Ferriss.

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,790
What you're about to hear is part two
of a two part conversation with Ramit

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:09,960
Sethi.
He is an entrepreneur,

5
00:00:09,961 --> 00:00:13,320
he's tried venture backed now he's
going self funded, bootstrapped.

6
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:18,590
He is a behavioral change and persuasion
expert and also a very good friend of

7
00:00:18,691 --> 00:00:20,490
mine.
If you didn't catch the first part,

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,400
you might want to do that before
venturing in. If you don't mind,

9
00:00:23,401 --> 00:00:25,110
your stories is more of a jigsaw puzzle,

10
00:00:25,111 --> 00:00:29,550
then by all means keep on listening and
we tend to bounce around quite a lot.

11
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:33,090
So I think that you could almost listen
to them in reverse order and still get a

12
00:00:33,091 --> 00:00:35,820
lot out of it.
But for the background context and so on.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,080
Part one has a lot of that.

14
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,660
This episode is brought to you
by the Tim Ferriss Book Club,

15
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:43,920
a handful of books that have had a huge
impact on my life and keep in mind that

16
00:00:43,921 --> 00:00:46,200
I read three to four
books a week on average.

17
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,080
So these are four to six that have
really made a huge difference.

would like to join me, Richard Branson,

20
00:00:58,081 --> 00:01:02,460
Seth Godin and some other amazing folks.
I'm not calling myself amazing,

21
00:01:02,461 --> 00:01:04,890
but those people aren't
managing, uh, on Necker Island,

22
00:01:04,891 --> 00:01:09,320
which is Richard Branson's private
island for a week of mentorship. Uh,

23
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:13,890
it's going to be amazing.

25

And now without further ado,

26
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:25,580
please enjoy part to the final part of
the Tim Ferriss show with Ramit Sethi.

27
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:31,410
My hands start shaking.

28
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:39,510
I'm a cybernetic organism living

29
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:48,700
now.
So

30
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,810
the revenue per email,

31
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm your quintessential case of
reticence to monetize. Right?

32
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,080
And of course I've been,

33
00:01:56,110 --> 00:02:00,160
I've been ridiculed for years by many
friends because of this, which is fine.

34
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,850
My general approach to date has been,

35
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:09,170
it's either free or it's really,
really high end and very expensive. Uh,

36
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,110
and I think a good example of that was
Ota opening the Kimono that that event

37
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,060
that I said was going to be one time,

38
00:02:16,061 --> 00:02:20,350
and at least to date it has only been
one time and it was depending on when

39
00:02:20,351 --> 00:02:21,041
people sign up.

40
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:26,041
It was between $7,500 and $10,000 a seat
and it's sold out from one blog post.

41
00:02:27,371 --> 00:02:30,190
And I remember I was talking to
someone about event management,

42
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:31,740
somebody who does this for a living.

43
00:02:31,741 --> 00:02:36,730
I mean someone who's putting on events
once a quarter making a lot of money from

44
00:02:36,731 --> 00:02:38,200
the events or or so I thought,

45
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:43,290
and I asked her at one point what she
would do to fill an event with between a

46
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,920
hundred and say 20 and 200 people at
this given price point. She said, well,

47
00:02:47,921 --> 00:02:51,820
you're going to have to hire a full
time person to do, to falling 12 things.

48
00:02:51,821 --> 00:02:54,520
You're probably going to have to pay
for the following type of marketing and

49
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,780
outbound and this and that.

50
00:02:55,781 --> 00:02:58,630
And the other thing and all
it took was one blog post.

51
00:02:58,631 --> 00:03:03,631
And now the way I explain that is that
I've given away so much free content and

52
00:03:04,901 --> 00:03:05,734
value,

53
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:10,840
hundreds of books worth of content on
the blog that I've established a level of

54
00:03:10,841 --> 00:03:15,100
trust with my audience so that when
I finally offer something for sale,

55
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:18,340
the understand and assume I've given
it a lot of thought, which is true.

56
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,380
Do you think that's a foolish approach?

57
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,420
No,
I think it's great.

58
00:03:21,421 --> 00:03:26,421
I mean I give away 98% of my material
for free and then for many of my flagship

59
00:03:27,121 --> 00:03:27,571
courses,

60
00:03:27,571 --> 00:03:32,340
they're extremely expensive if I tend
to 100 times what my competitors charge.

61
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:37,050
So I love the idea. In fact, I'll
even take it one step further.

62
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,990
You know a lot of times people,
they would come to me and say like,

63
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:41,430
that's ridiculous.

64
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:46,830
Maybe if it were $30 and I just smiled
because I don't play in the $30 sandbox,

65
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,970
I don't want to play there.
I'd rather give it to you for free.

66
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,920
Then play in the $30 sandbox.

67
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:58,250
And I think it's very important when you
think about pricing and positioning is

68
00:03:58,261 --> 00:04:00,720
very important to think.
What does this mean for you?

69
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:04,110
It's the same reason where if you go to
the farmer's market and you see a guy

70
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:04,950
selling a tee shirt,

71
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,220
you know he's selling it for 25 bucks and
you go in there and say, I'll give you,

72
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,930
I'll give you $3.
Look,

73
00:04:09,931 --> 00:04:14,931
the guys probably still making a profit
on $3 but why is he going to laugh you

74
00:04:15,151 --> 00:04:17,460
out of his store and just
turn his back on you? Why?

75
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:21,210
Because he doesn't want
to play in the $3 sandbox.

76
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:24,000
And he would rather just say a blanket,
no,

77
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:27,000
then even make a small amount of revenue.

78
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:32,220
So I really love the idea of
giveaway as much as you can for free,

79
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,590
but don't be afraid to aggressively sell.

80
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:38,820
We are unapologetic about how aggressive
we are because we've done the testing

81
00:04:38,821 --> 00:04:43,290
and we know that it works. So we sell at
high price points and we sell, you know,

82
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,030
when we sell. And, um, I mean,

83
00:04:45,031 --> 00:04:48,180
I could share stories of how we've
done that and all that stuff,

84
00:04:48,181 --> 00:04:50,280
but I think you should be
unapologetic about that.

85
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:53,650
And, um, so, so let's take
her to take a real case then,

86
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:56,320
something that I've been considering,
but I've been very hesitant about,

87
00:04:56,321 --> 00:04:58,060
and I've been considering
this for a long time.

88
00:04:58,061 --> 00:05:01,210
I know you probably kind of laughing to
yourself because every time we meet up,

89
00:05:01,211 --> 00:05:03,210
I'm like, you know, I've
been thinking about this.
