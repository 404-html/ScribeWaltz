1
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:12,540
Uh, want to talk about
grief a bit? So I've

2
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,120
lost a number of,

3
00:00:15,121 --> 00:00:18,060
like I mentioned close friends and
a mentor in the last 12 months.

4
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,130
And uh, you mentioned your
husband who passed away earlier.

5
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:28,030
Uh, and if I get any facts wrong,
obviously please correct me.

6
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,770
But colorectal cancer 42,
I'm 40,

7
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:36,630
which really caught my attention and my,

8
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,590
the first time I had an opportunity to
go abroad outside of the United States

9
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,890
was to Japan as an exchange student.
And I lived with a family,

10
00:00:43,891 --> 00:00:48,390
went to Japanese high school and I'm
still close to that family 25 years later.

11
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,610
And the father and that host family
is my second father effectively.

12
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,480
And I planned on bringing my American
family to Japan later this year to meet

13
00:00:57,481 --> 00:00:59,730
them for the first time,
my two families.

14
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,810
And I just found out that my host
father's in the hospital, uh,

15
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:08,250
late stage,
very aggressive cancer diagnosed,

16
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:12,660
uh, as metastasized, probably will
pass away in the next two months.

17
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,440
And what kind of cancer? Uh, it's,

18
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,720
I would have to go back to
the email because it was,

19
00:01:18,721 --> 00:01:23,460
it was very emotional and then cognitively
difficult for me to translate because

20
00:01:23,461 --> 00:01:27,930
there's a lot, it's in Japanese and it
was all specialized medical terminology,

21
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:33,330
but it's, it's in the lung, it's in
the liver. Uh, a lifelong smoker,

22
00:01:33,331 --> 00:01:37,970
very typical for Japanese at that age.
I think it might be also a sofa.

23
00:01:37,971 --> 00:01:41,960
Jeal uh, so this is, Ha has had
me thinking about grief and, uh,

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,730
is there anything I should do
in advance to prepare for that?

25
00:01:44,731 --> 00:01:47,760
And they'd just be very curious if
you're willing to talk about it,

26
00:01:47,761 --> 00:01:52,761
to describe your experience of grieving.

27
00:01:52,801 --> 00:01:55,140
And you could start at any point in time,

28
00:01:55,141 --> 00:01:58,260
but as it relates to your experience with,
with your husband,

29
00:01:58,261 --> 00:02:00,060
and certainly after that we
can get into it. But I mean,

30
00:02:00,061 --> 00:02:05,061
you've done a tremendous job
of highlighting the types
of diagnostic tools and

31
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:09,360
preventative tools that people can
use, which, which we'll talk about. But

32
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:13,640
I don't even know how to
think about grief. I mean,

33
00:02:13,641 --> 00:02:16,280
I don't know if I've allowed myself
to ever experience it before,

34
00:02:16,281 --> 00:02:21,260
but I know I'm going to be hit with a
hammer. A couple of friends that I did.

35
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,210
No, I did. They have passed away.

36
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:28,370
And it's been very recent that it hasn't
been this close. These are friends,

37
00:02:28,371 --> 00:02:33,290
but they're not a second father to
me. Uh, and I think in a sense the,

38
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:35,720
um, the mentor passed away.
It did hit me pretty hard,

39
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:40,370
but I've only in the last six to 12 months
actually been allowing myself to feel

40
00:02:40,371 --> 00:02:42,950
more things. That's a much
longer story. But, uh,

41
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:47,510
I've had a lot of it kind of conflicted
relationship with this person.

42
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:52,880
I know I've had a lot of armor for
decades that I've built up over time for a

43
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:56,990
lot of different reasons and it's
been very useful for some things,

44
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,191
for protecting me,

45
00:02:58,191 --> 00:03:01,870
but I've realized that it also keeps a
lot in that is very ultimately corrosive.

46
00:03:01,871 --> 00:03:06,871
So I'm trying to develop
more of an ability to feel
and instead of looking at it

47
00:03:09,401 --> 00:03:11,600
as a liability,
um,

48
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:16,290
slash I don't know. How do you,
how do you describe grief? Um,

49
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,640
I mean, I can, I can talk a little bit
about my personal experience. You know,

50
00:03:21,641 --> 00:03:26,530
I had a, I was on top of the
world, had this great job,

51
00:03:26,531 --> 00:03:31,030
had two beautiful children and
of course a wonderful husband.

52
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:34,300
I have to say we were having challenges,

53
00:03:34,301 --> 00:03:39,301
some challenges in our marriage because
I think I had this just sort of out of

54
00:03:39,641 --> 00:03:44,410
the blue success and some suddenly
became a household name and had all this

55
00:03:44,411 --> 00:03:45,280
attention,

56
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:50,530
which I think can put a lot of pressure
on a relationship or suddenly it doesn't

57
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:54,880
feel the power dynamic doesn't
feel as equal. Right. Um,

58
00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:00,760
but, uh, you know, we were,

59
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:04,510
we were really, you know,

60
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:08,800
and love and enjoying our lives.
And,

61
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:14,650
uh, you know, just out of the
blue, Jay hadn't been feeling well.

62
00:04:14,651 --> 00:04:18,100
He had been tired. He'd been traveling
and we kept thinking, oh, east,

63
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:22,900
we have two little kids. He's
covering the Oj Simpson trial. He was,

64
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,960
uh, you know, his schedule was crazy.

65
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:30,190
And then out of the blue he
just was doubled over in pain.

66
00:04:30,191 --> 00:04:33,760
And our nanny who was Irish
at the time called and said,

67
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:37,720
chase doubled over in pain and uh,
I don't know what to do.

68
00:04:37,721 --> 00:04:42,400
So he didn't have a doctor like
so many young men, which is,

69
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,830
you know, if anybody
takes, there are many,

70
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:48,100
I think takeaways from our conversation,
I hope.

71
00:04:48,101 --> 00:04:51,280
But one is that men especially,

72
00:04:51,281 --> 00:04:54,490
I think because women go
see gynecologists honestly,

73
00:04:54,491 --> 00:04:59,491
that a lot of men don't go
and get physicals or they
don't even have a GP or an

74
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:04,390
internist. And Shave was one of those
guys who played lacrosse and football and,

75
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:08,650
and college and was never smoked ever.

76
00:05:08,651 --> 00:05:11,290
I don't think he ever even
tried a cigarette. I never,

77
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:15,850
I don't think he even tried pot ever. It's
sort of crazy when you think about it.

78
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:20,950
Drank moderately, uh, took pretty
good care of himself. I mean,

79
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,720
and uh, and it just, boom,

80
00:05:25,721 --> 00:05:30,130
he had stage four metastatic colon cancer.
So we went from one day,

81
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,600
just everything was great.
We were buying a house in the country and,

82
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:38,230
or had a house in the country
and we're really enjoying that.

83
00:05:38,231 --> 00:05:43,231
And Jay was riding horses in central
park and doing his thing professionally.

84
00:05:43,271 --> 00:05:48,100
And I was at the today show and our
girls were great. And, uh, we had,

85
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:48,401
I mean,

86
00:05:48,401 --> 00:05:53,401
Carrie was less than a year at the time
or just had turned a year old when he

87
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:58,561
was diagnosed on April 3rd,

88
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:01,910
1998, 1997. Sorry,

89
00:06:01,911 --> 00:06:06,440
he died nine months later in January.
But,

90
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:09,440
um, you know, it's just, it's so,

91
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:14,330
it's so debilitating and chattering
and destabilizing and, you know,

92
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,800
it's such a process.

93
00:06:15,801 --> 00:06:20,801
And I was in such denial and he
was one of these very smart people,

94
00:06:21,111 --> 00:06:23,210
but he didn't want to
know about his health.

95
00:06:23,211 --> 00:06:26,480
He didn't want to know the gory details.
I don't know why,

96
00:06:26,481 --> 00:06:28,220
because he was so smart,

97
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:33,050
intellectually curious and
interested and I don't know,

98
00:06:33,051 --> 00:06:37,610
maybe he knew. So I kept all this
stuff from him, which I really regret.

99
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:41,510
I would say, oh, there's only
shadows on your liver. Don't worry.

100
00:06:41,511 --> 00:06:44,990
It's going to be okay. Uh,
we're going to figure it out.

101
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:48,110
I remember sending his scans to Nih,
you know,

102
00:06:48,111 --> 00:06:50,800
cause I had a lot of
connections because of my job.

103
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:56,200
And I remember very prominent cancer
scientists calling me and saying,

104
00:06:56,721 --> 00:06:59,870
Oh God, this is, this is really bad. He,

105
00:06:59,871 --> 00:07:02,510
I arranged for him to
get hepatic artery pump,

106
00:07:02,511 --> 00:07:07,190
which pushed the chemo directly to
his liver that was covered. I mean,

107
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,070
the tumor burden on his liver was

108
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:16,940
awful. And, uh, anyway,
so I was, I went into,

109
00:07:16,941 --> 00:07:18,200
I think my,

110
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:22,610
my husband John says I'm very
good in an emergency. You know,

111
00:07:22,611 --> 00:07:27,611
I get very focused and very
proactive and driven and I went into,

112
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,690
I am going to try to fix this mode.
And uh,

113
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,520
so I was sort of doing that,

114
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:39,350
I think to avoid the grief because I had
to do something and it was just, I mean,

115
00:07:39,351 --> 00:07:43,850
what can I say? It's the worst
thing in the world to see someone,

116
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:44,631
first of all,

117
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:49,631
your life just changed in an instant
then to see someone suffering then to try

118
00:07:50,901 --> 00:07:54,950
to figure out how can you help
somebody. I mean, it's just,

119
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:58,640
it's really overwhelming.
And, uh, you know,

120
00:07:58,641 --> 00:08:03,641
I think my grieving process began the
day he was diagnosed because my doctor,

121
00:08:05,841 --> 00:08:10,610
who was the internist, Jay went to see
when he was in this pain. You know,

122
00:08:10,611 --> 00:08:14,780
he pulled me aside into one of those
little patient rooms in the hospital and

123
00:08:14,781 --> 00:08:17,750
said, [inaudible] the, this is really bad.

124
00:08:17,751 --> 00:08:22,250
That the prognosis is very bleak.
So what do you do with that?

125
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:27,280
Except for do everything you
possibly can to change the outcome,

126
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:33,440
which you realize you probably
can't change anyway. It's a very,

127
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:37,910
uh, challenging thing to
deal with, but you know, I,

128
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:41,780
maybe my regrets will help you
with your situation and that

129
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,680
I never really said to Jay,

130
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,160
what are your hopes and
dreams for your kids?

131
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,920
Can you write the girls a letter?

132
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:56,190
Can we videotape you talking to them,
uh,

133
00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:02,210
to say everything I wanted to say to
him because that was an acknowledgement

134
00:09:02,431 --> 00:09:05,190
that he was gonna die and
I just couldn't do that.

135
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:10,730
So maybe if things are so bleak for
this person is so special to you.

136
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:15,720
First of all, you need to tell
him no and you need to write him.

137
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:21,020
Maybe go see him and feel that
that you don't have any regrets.

138
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:24,910
Thank you.
