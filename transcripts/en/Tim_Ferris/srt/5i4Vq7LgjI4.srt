Hello Ladies and germs.

23
00:01:39,031 --> 00:01:42,720
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to
another episode of the Tim Ferriss show.

24
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,430
For those of you new to the program,

25
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:48,150
this is where I try to
deconstruct excellence.

26
00:01:48,151 --> 00:01:50,730
I talked to people who are the
best in the world, what they do,

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
and try to distill or extract the tools
and tips and resources that you can use,

28
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,140
and this episode is a very unusual
one, a very fun one, a very useful one.

29
00:02:01,141 --> 00:02:04,200
I hope the episode guest is Mark Goodman.

30
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:08,370
Mark Goodman has been a resident futurist
with the FBI and worked as a senior

31
00:02:08,371 --> 00:02:11,100
advisor to Interpol.
Specifically.

32
00:02:11,101 --> 00:02:14,340
He's considered one of the world's
leading authorities on global security.

33
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:19,460
And in this episode we'll go very deep
into the digital underground to expose

34
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,920
the many ways that criminals,
corporations, countries,

35
00:02:22,921 --> 00:02:27,690
organized crime and the list goes on are
using emerging technologies against you

36
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:31,560
and some of the simple steps that you
can take to decrease your vulnerability.

37
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:32,490
Sure.

38
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:36,540
Three d printers can produce
AK 47 [inaudible] bioterrorist
can now download the

39
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:40,830
recipe for Spanish flu and cartels are
using fleets of drones to carry drugs

40
00:02:40,831 --> 00:02:44,520
across borders. All of which we'll touch
on. But what else is waiting for you?

41
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:49,110
What else is potentially targeting
you right now? We'll dig into it all.

42
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,480
And this is not from a paranoid nutjob
and I think it's important to underscore

43
00:02:54,481 --> 00:02:56,700
this.
This is from a very pragmatic,

44
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,980
real life oriented problem
solver who has been

45
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,170
hired by people like the FBI and Interpol.

46
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:07,380
This is an informed insider and he
will describe the wild west that is the

47
00:03:07,661 --> 00:03:08,494
internet.

48
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:13,000
And in that wild west ignorance is
no excuse for being defenseless.

49
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,780
If you want to hear about current and
future threats and simple defensive steps

50
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:20,770
you can take, then this interview
is for you. So without further ado,

51
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:22,210
please meet Mark Goodman.

52
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,820
Hello Ladies and gentlemen, boys
and girls. This is Tim Ferriss.

53
00:03:28,821 --> 00:03:31,400
And welcome to another episode
of the Tim Ferriss show.

54
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:36,820
I am so excited I can barely enunciate
properly because I have Mark Goodman on

55
00:03:37,491 --> 00:03:42,260
the show and I'll give a quick bio for
mark and you'll very quickly realized why

56
00:03:42,261 --> 00:03:46,130
I'm excited to have him on a, and this
is pretty much directly from the bio,

57
00:03:46,131 --> 00:03:50,000
but he is, he's spent a career in law
enforcement in many different capacities.

58
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:54,350
Uh, that includes work as a futurist for
the FBI who knew they had such a thing,

59
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:59,180
a senior adviser to Interpol and also
on the street as a police officer. Uh,

60
00:03:59,181 --> 00:04:03,560
he's the founder of the Future Crimes
Institute and the chair for Policy Law and

61
00:04:03,561 --> 00:04:06,800
ethics at Singularity University
where I've had some involvement, uh,

62
00:04:06,801 --> 00:04:11,801
often at Nasa Ames and he's continued
to investigate the often terrifying

63
00:04:12,201 --> 00:04:14,780
intersection of science or technology.

64
00:04:14,781 --> 00:04:19,340
And crime and uncovering all sorts of
different nascent threats and combating

65
00:04:19,341 --> 00:04:20,840
the darker sides of technology,

66
00:04:20,841 --> 00:04:25,841
which I think don't get as much sort
of radio time perhaps as all of the

67
00:04:25,911 --> 00:04:30,560
promise, uh, that, that we, that we hear
about and the benefits of Moore's law.

68
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:35,570
Uh, he is also the author of
the forthcoming future crimes.

69
00:04:35,571 --> 00:04:38,630
And subtitle pretty much tells you
a lot of what you need to know.

70
00:04:38,631 --> 00:04:42,020
Everything is connected, everyone is
vulnerable and what we can do about it.

71
00:04:42,021 --> 00:04:45,300
So mark, thank you so much for
being on the show. Thank you Tammy.

72
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:50,300
It's an honor to be here with you and
I am thrilled to have you on because I

73
00:04:50,301 --> 00:04:54,260
wanted to grab you as quickly as I could
because I think that you are going to

74
00:04:54,261 --> 00:04:58,430
be getting interviewed a lot, uh,
in the, in the upcoming months. Uh,

75
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:02,870
because many people are
completely unaware of.

76
00:05:02,871 --> 00:05:03,704
I think the,

77
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:08,890
the threats that are not only in some
cases ubiquitous now or at least,

78
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:14,150
uh, upcoming, but, uh, soon we'll
be right at our doorsteps. And,

79
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:14,360
uh,

80
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:19,190
just as some background for people who
are listening because I've had a lot of

81
00:05:19,191 --> 00:05:24,130
public exposure since the unexpected
success of the first book. I've really,

82
00:05:24,131 --> 00:05:24,770
he,
uh,

83
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:29,000
come to realize this in a very personal
way and I've had people try to hack my

84
00:05:29,001 --> 00:05:31,310
sites, hack my phone, uh,

85
00:05:31,311 --> 00:05:34,940
impersonate different people in my life
to get information from other people.

86
00:05:34,941 --> 00:05:39,800
It's been a real fast education
and cloak and dagger stuff.

87
00:05:39,801 --> 00:05:42,800
But I wanted to make sure I,
I gave a very brief overview,

88
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:47,801
but is there anything from your background
or bio that I missed that I should

89
00:05:48,621 --> 00:05:49,454
share with folks?

90
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:54,420
Uh, one thing you didn't mention is the
fact that I'm a huge fan of Tim Ferris.

91
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:58,880
I really love the four hour work week
and it's quite an honor for me to be

92
00:05:58,881 --> 00:06:00,080
speaking with you today.

93
00:06:00,081 --> 00:06:04,040
I actually got one of the earliest
additions of the book and some of the

94
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:07,520
entrepreneurship, uh, suggestions
that you cover. It, uh,

95
00:06:07,521 --> 00:06:12,080
were ideas that I tried to implement
in law enforcement and a with some

96
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:16,290
difficulty, but I tried and it was
a pretty good fun and actually, uh,

97
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:20,080
took your advice on some of the things you
did. I went on an information diet, uh,

98
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:24,410
not a real diet but an information
diet. And I also, uh, you know,

99
00:06:24,411 --> 00:06:27,260
have a love of foreign language the
way you do and actually enrolled in the

100
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:30,560
heart and actually in Berlin, in
Germany. Uh, just the way you did.

101
00:06:30,561 --> 00:06:32,000
So thank you for your book.

102
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:34,100
That's something else I wanted
to mention right off the top.

103
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:39,320
Oh well that of course completely
makes my week and a bit of shooting.

104
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:43,420
I hope so. Dunkin shoot, I
hope you had fun. That was a,

105
00:06:43,421 --> 00:06:47,890
I had a great time at the heart
nuptual in Berlin. Um, and you know,

106
00:06:47,891 --> 00:06:52,030
I think that that language is a,
is a,

107
00:06:52,031 --> 00:06:57,031
is a metaphor for so many
different aspects of life and the,

108
00:06:57,451 --> 00:07:02,451
the becoming fluent in a language or
becoming fluent in technology I think can

109
00:07:02,681 --> 00:07:06,190
sound very intimidating to people,
but it doesn't have to be super,

110
00:07:06,191 --> 00:07:08,560
super complicated. But,
but, but before we dig in,

111
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:12,760
I'm going to try something a
little different and that is to do,

112
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,320
we're going to do the interview in German.

113
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:18,770
We're going to do the interview in German
and I'll try to teach you Swahili. No,

114
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,880
I thought that we might do just a little
bit of calisthenics by doing some rapid

115
00:07:24,281 --> 00:07:27,340
fire questions first just to
loosen up the joints. Great.

116
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:31,210
And then we can jump into
a, all of the, the, uh,

117
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,020
the spy versus spy stuff,
which I am absolutely obsessed with,

118
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:37,900
which a lot of people might not realize.
But before we do that,

119
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:41,920
I have to get into the, the really
important stuff. Such as, uh,

120
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:45,490
Sean Connery came to your house for
dinner. What would you cook them?

121
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:49,220
What I cook him. I don't know if he'd
eat, but I'd make him some drinks.

122
00:07:49,221 --> 00:07:50,930
I'm sure you'd have a nice drink.

123
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,300
What would you, what's,
what's the cocktail or the

124
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:56,830
choice? I think for him, a Martini.
He'd be a Martini kind of guy.

125
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:01,880
Janie Kinda guy. Uh, do you have
any favorite documentaries or,

126
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,250
uh,
or films that come to mind?

127
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:09,330
God, I love film. Uh, and I
love a stupid eighties comedy.

128
00:08:09,331 --> 00:08:12,770
So Ghostbusters, uh, it
was great. And you know,

129
00:08:12,771 --> 00:08:15,950
anything of that genre or anything
with Bill Murray or Dan Akroyd in it.

130
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:20,690
I'm a fan and of course I like all those
ads hacking movies like war games and

131
00:08:20,691 --> 00:08:22,100
sneakers and that type of stuff.

132
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,640
So of the, of the, uh,

133
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:28,840
at the hacking genre or the
crime slash spice genre,

134
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:29,830
what movie,

135
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:34,840
what movies that you like our closest
to reality and furthest from reality?

136
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,890
Uh, that's interesting. Uh,

137
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:41,840
it's very funny when you see how a
Hollywood goes out and portrays hacking on

138
00:08:41,841 --> 00:08:43,340
the screen. Uh, you know,

139
00:08:43,341 --> 00:08:46,850
most hackers get a good laugh of what
they taught type at the c prompt.

140
00:08:46,851 --> 00:08:48,620
It's pretty funny. But, uh,

141
00:08:48,621 --> 00:08:53,621
I think actually I have to give a hat tip
to a Walter Parks who did the original

142
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:59,190
war games because considering that it
was in the early eighties before most

143
00:08:59,191 --> 00:09:02,700
people were thinking about computers,
I mean modems where, you know,

144
00:09:02,701 --> 00:09:04,560
super slow and incredibly rare.

145
00:09:04,561 --> 00:09:08,640
And the fact that he was able to bring
that hacker type out there and show that

146
00:09:08,641 --> 00:09:13,290
the Department of defense was connected
to the Internet and you could change

147
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:16,410
your grades.
I mean he did that 30 or so years ago.

148
00:09:16,411 --> 00:09:19,980
So that was really awesome
and I think that's great.

149
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:23,640
Some of the other hacker movies, a
Sandra Bullock, the net, you know,

150
00:09:23,641 --> 00:09:26,070
it was a nice movie,
not particularly realistic,

151
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,050
but there were elements of truth in it.

152
00:09:28,051 --> 00:09:31,140
So they're just been a lot of
silly hacker movies out there. Um,

153
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,700
because as I've been told, it's
difficult to show, you know,

154
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,440
cool hacker stuff on the screen in
a way that people don't understand.

155
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:42,930
Yeah. I had a computer scientist friend
of mine also said that you can always,

156
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:47,670
it's always amusing to watch a hacker's
typing and movies because they never

157
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:50,780
used the space bar.
And a,

158
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:54,060
you can tell when people are bs thing
on a keyboard because they never,

159
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:56,120
you never hear the
distinctive sort of thing.

160
00:09:56,121 --> 00:09:58,560
Lack of the thumb hitting the space bar

161
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,580
as you will know,
all the best hackers never use the space.

162
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:06,060
That's right. Very Tom. All the, all the
divorce act type was out there and like,

163
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:10,260
like Matt Mullenweg. Uh, let's see. The,

164
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:13,560
what is the book that you're most likely
to give as a gift or the book that

165
00:10:13,561 --> 00:10:15,990
you've given most as a gift to people?

166
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:20,000
Uh, this sounds like bs, but it's actually
been your book. Uh, I have to say,

167
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:24,410
I'll give it to a ton of people. I
have, I run into people all the time,

168
00:10:24,411 --> 00:10:27,680
both in law enforcement,
friends of mine, uh,

169
00:10:27,681 --> 00:10:31,130
folks that are struggling with their
careers and trying to think about

170
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:35,360
opportunities to see the world in a
different way. And I know bullshit.

171
00:10:35,361 --> 00:10:37,400
I've actually given away
about 10 copies of your book.

172
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:42,430
Wow. Well, I appreciate that
and I'm my publisher. Thanks
you for that as well. Yes,

173
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,980
that was before I had my own book
in the future. Of course my book.

174
00:10:46,981 --> 00:10:50,970
But up until then, you, you
were my favorite. Well, I'll
take, I'll take a runner up.

175
00:10:50,971 --> 00:10:52,830
When your book comes
out, are there any, uh,

176
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,320
are there any fiction books
that you particularly like?

177
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,650
It doesn't have to be science fiction
or any particular genre, but any,

178
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,830
any fiction books that have been
very influential in your life?

179
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:06,600
You know, there were some great, I love
the Old Street Chi Street crime drama. So,

180
00:11:06,601 --> 00:11:06,871
you know,

181
00:11:06,871 --> 00:11:10,740
having grown up in New York City and
kind of been very in tuned with the New

182
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,150
York City Police Department,
uh,

183
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:15,730
there was a book called one police plaza
by a guy called William [inaudible],

184
00:11:15,731 --> 00:11:19,830
which I thought was awesome
and just really got a,

185
00:11:19,831 --> 00:11:22,020
what policing was and what
policing was all about.

186
00:11:22,021 --> 00:11:23,160
And I thought that was pretty amazing.

187
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,420
Very cool.
Now I'd love to check that out.

188
00:11:25,421 --> 00:11:30,310
I know less about the police than I
do the, uh, the other aspects of the,

189
00:11:30,311 --> 00:11:33,280
of the military, oddly enough.
You know, so it's, it's the,

190
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:36,910
the law enforcement that I
have the most contact with,

191
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:39,830
I have the least knowledge of,
uh,

192
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:44,950
I understand this ironic.
Uh, let's see here.

193
00:11:44,951 --> 00:11:47,080
I'm not going to ask too many
more of these because I want to,

194
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:51,300
I want to jump into, um,
of course the, uh, the,

195
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:54,610
you're the subject that
are your expertise,

196
00:11:54,611 --> 00:11:58,750
but do you have any
particular morning routines?

197
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:00,520
What does the first hour
of your day look like?

198
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,710
Ah,
I wake up,

199
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:06,970
I take my dog out for a walk
and then I have a breakfast,

200
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,020
which I really enjoy,

201
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:11,320
catch up on some news emails and
then go on and take on the day.

202
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:14,000
What time do you typically wake up?

203
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:16,150
It depends.
I do a lot of traveling,

204
00:12:16,151 --> 00:12:19,450
so it depends on what time zone
I'm in and how jet lagged I meant,

205
00:12:19,451 --> 00:12:21,880
but I'm more on the early side these days,
I'd say.

206
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:26,970
Got It. Uh, and that is, that's like a
7:00 AM kind of thing or a success. Right.

207
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:31,800
Uh, yesterday I was up at five the day
before I was up at five and then, uh,

208
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:34,860
mostly I would say six 37
something in that timeframe.

209
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:40,210
Got It. And uh, do you change your,

210
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:43,750
how does your routine change on the
weekends? How do you decompress if you,

211
00:12:43,751 --> 00:12:44,584
if you do?

212
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,780
Uh, I like to go for hikes.
I like to go outside,

213
00:12:47,781 --> 00:12:51,320
like going to the movie theater is
seeing films, hanging out with friends,

214
00:12:51,321 --> 00:12:54,200
all the kind of standard
stuff. But, uh, you know,

215
00:12:54,201 --> 00:12:56,120
for the past year when
I was writing the book,

216
00:12:56,121 --> 00:12:58,250
it mostly was my butt in chair typing.

217
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:03,980
Right. Uh, when you think
of the word successful,

218
00:13:03,981 --> 00:13:08,630
who's the first person who
comes to mind? Hmm. Wow.

219
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:13,100
There's so many different ways
to define success. Uh, I mean,

220
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:15,920
Martin Luther King Join,
you know,

221
00:13:15,921 --> 00:13:17,810
is one of the first guys
that pops into my head.

222
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:22,280
Clinton was a produce
successful politician. There
are lots of folks out there.

223
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:26,540
Uh, and of course, you know,
any of the entrepreneurs
like Steve jobs and the like.

224
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:32,420
Got It. Uh, so let's jump into,

225
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:37,690
uh, the, the subject matter
at hand and, uh, and,

226
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,070
and we can tackle this from
many different perspectives,

227
00:13:40,071 --> 00:13:43,010
but perhaps you could give, uh, maybe,

228
00:13:43,011 --> 00:13:47,750
maybe if you facts or examples of things
that might surprise people in the world

229
00:13:47,751 --> 00:13:51,920
of whether it's currently existing crime
or things that you see right on the

230
00:13:51,921 --> 00:13:53,900
horizon coming down the pike.

231
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:57,580
Sure. I'd be happy to do that. Basically,

232
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:01,810
my take on this is that folks are very
focused on the cyber crime of today.

233
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:02,980
Every day in the news,

234
00:14:02,981 --> 00:14:05,440
whether it be the New York Times
or the Wall Street Journal,

235
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:09,340
we're hearing that target was hacked and
Home Depot is hacked and JP Morgan was

236
00:14:09,341 --> 00:14:09,970
hacked.

237
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:14,080
And what's interesting to me is that the
media treats all of these as distinct

238
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:16,630
incidents. Like, Oh, another
company was hacked, you know,

239
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:21,130
a bunch of celebrities had their
naked photos. Uh, you know, uh, uh,

240
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:22,450
tipped off by a hacker.

241
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,990
That stuff is all treated as
if it were an individual act.

242
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:27,540
And what people don't see,
uh,

243
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:32,440
from a 35,000 foot view is that
there's a systemic issue going on,

244
00:14:32,441 --> 00:14:37,030
which is something I try to mention in
future crimes. It's the fact that we have,

245
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:39,850
uh, thanks to Moore's law,
which you mentioned earlier,

246
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,100
we're just moving at an exponential rate.

247
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:46,030
And so we're plugging more and more
things into the Internet. And the fact is,

248
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:49,180
as you well know,
software is eating the world.

249
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,720
So everything is becoming software.
Everything is becoming a computer.

250
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:56,120
A car is not a car anymore.

251
00:14:56,121 --> 00:15:00,920
It's no longer a mechanical device that
is 250 computer chips in it at a minimum.

252
00:15:00,921 --> 00:15:03,920
So a car is basically a
Unix box that we ride in.

253
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,350
An elevator is a computer that
takes us from floor to floor. Um,

254
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,830
and as Cory Doctorow says,

255
00:15:09,831 --> 00:15:14,240
an airplane is a flying solares box
with a bunch of industrial controllers.

256
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:16,640
So people don't realize that.

257
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:21,970
And the big takeaway from that is that
never has there been a computer system

258
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:26,360
that could not be hacked. In other
words, every computer system is hackable.

259
00:15:26,361 --> 00:15:28,100
There are no unhackable machines.

260
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:33,320
And that has some really
profound consequences for us
as a society and the world

261
00:15:33,321 --> 00:15:38,321
that we're building because we're about
to add between 50 and 200 billion new

262
00:15:39,411 --> 00:15:42,800
devices to the Internet, uh,
uh, to the Internet of things.

263
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,130
Depending on who you ask. CISCOE,
we'll say 50 billion by the year,

264
00:15:46,131 --> 00:15:50,090
2020 until says 200
billion by the year 2020.

265
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:54,710
The impact of that is that we're
going to go from an Internet that is

266
00:15:54,711 --> 00:15:59,450
theoretically or metaphorically the size
of a golf ball today to one that is the

267
00:15:59,451 --> 00:16:03,530
size of the sun, right? Massive,

268
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:06,470
massive improvements. Reasons.
Yeah. We're just at the very,

269
00:16:06,471 --> 00:16:09,170
very earliest days of the Internet.
And so the,

270
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:12,530
I guess you'd say mistake that a lot
of people make is they think we're

271
00:16:12,531 --> 00:16:14,870
technologically advanced today.
Uh,

272
00:16:14,871 --> 00:16:19,310
but they have no idea of the tsunami
of technology that's coming our way

273
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,413
tomorrow.

274
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,070
And I think also to underscore that,

275
00:16:23,071 --> 00:16:28,071
that that human beings intrinsically
are very bad at thinking in exponential

276
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:32,610
terms. Uh, they're just, they're, they're
very bad at predicting. For instance,

277
00:16:32,611 --> 00:16:35,670
I mean the, the, the answers
to a lot of these old riddles,

278
00:16:35,671 --> 00:16:40,230
such as you take one grain of rice and
you double it for each square on the

279
00:16:40,231 --> 00:16:43,320
chessboard and how many,
how many pieces of rice do you have,

280
00:16:43,321 --> 00:16:45,430
how many grains of rice do
you have by the end? And it's,

281
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:49,260
it's very hard for people to anticipate,
uh,

282
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:52,620
how quickly things can
change. Uh, for instance, uh,

283
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,420
I've listened to a number of your talks,

284
00:16:54,421 --> 00:16:56,850
you have a great ted
talk and the fact that,

285
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:01,470
and this may even be more accelerated now,
I think your talk was in 2012,

286
00:17:01,471 --> 00:17:06,150
but the DNA sequencing is proceeding
at five times Moore's law, uh,

287
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:11,151
in the impact that that has
on a sort of privacy and,

288
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:15,580
uh, the, the, uh, the weaponization of,

289
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:19,650
of different types of code.
Right. And, um, there's,

290
00:17:19,651 --> 00:17:22,300
there's another term that you
also used a phrase rather than,

291
00:17:22,301 --> 00:17:25,080
that's the technological arms race,
sort of the,

292
00:17:25,081 --> 00:17:26,700
the white hat versus the black hat.

293
00:17:26,701 --> 00:17:30,390
And then you have a bunch of folks
in between. So I'd be curious to hear

294
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:35,860
sort of where things
stand now compared to a,

295
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:40,680
it a horrible 60 hour siege in Mumbai
that you've talked about before. Were,

296
00:17:40,681 --> 00:17:41,580
were terrorists,
you know,

297
00:17:41,581 --> 00:17:45,330
built their own ops center in Pakistan
to monitor the progress of these attacks

298
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:50,370
in real time and where they'd be executing
people with a hand gun, one hand wall,

299
00:17:50,371 --> 00:17:52,500
looking at their cell phone in another,

300
00:17:52,501 --> 00:17:57,150
which gave them a huge situational on
tactical advantage over the police. Uh,

301
00:17:57,151 --> 00:17:59,880
but those were with
relatively primitive devices,

302
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:02,790
all things considered because
I think that was in 2006 or,

303
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:05,490
or somewhere along those lines.
Right?

304
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:10,960
The 2008 in Mumbai. Yeah.
I apologize. And, uh,

305
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:16,440
and that I remember doing research
for the, for the four hour body.

306
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:20,910
At one point I was chatting with a
scientist who shall remain unnamed,

307
00:18:20,911 --> 00:18:25,911
but he was talking about how negligent
it was in his mind for a very well known

308
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:29,520
tech Titan to have released all of his,
uh,

309
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:34,500
genetic data or as is his DNA
sequencing, uh, because people could,

310
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:35,603
uh,

311
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:40,760
create personalized biological
weapons to attack him.

312
00:18:40,891 --> 00:18:41,940
And it's,
it's sort of,

313
00:18:41,941 --> 00:18:46,470
I think to the uninitiated seems like
complete science fiction, like a fantasy,

314
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,100
but, uh, where are we with that
type of thing? I mean, does that,

315
00:18:50,101 --> 00:18:52,880
is that already being
used on people? Uh, yeah.

316
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:57,520
So you're spot on actually
a, with everything that
you just said. Uh, in fact,

317
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:02,350
the cost of sequencing human genomes has
dropped precipitously and is dropping

318
00:19:02,351 --> 00:19:05,740
at five times faster than Moore's law.
So with Moore's law,

319
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,320
silicon based technology ones and Zeros,

320
00:19:08,321 --> 00:19:12,070
that is doubling every 18 to 24
months depending on who you ask.

321
00:19:12,071 --> 00:19:15,490
And Ray Kurzweil has shown
in the singularity is near,

322
00:19:15,491 --> 00:19:19,480
and many times since that there is
this persistent exponential pace of

323
00:19:19,481 --> 00:19:20,314
technology.

324
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:25,500
Synthetic biology and genetics are
outpacing that by a factor of five.

325
00:19:25,571 --> 00:19:30,571
So a bio biological advancements
and computational biology,

326
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:34,960
we're pretty much proceeding at Moore's
law is pace until 2008 when there were

327
00:19:34,961 --> 00:19:38,140
some massive breakthroughs
in genetic sequencing,

328
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,760
which made it go five times faster.
So what is the result of that? Well,

329
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:46,960
there'll be tremendous opportunities
for each one of us to know our genome.

330
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:47,831
For example,
today,

331
00:19:47,831 --> 00:19:51,680
most people would certainly never consider
going in for a full genetic, you know,

332
00:19:51,681 --> 00:19:54,910
genome sequencing prohibitively expensive.

333
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:58,890
When the US government launched
the human genome project, uh,

334
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:00,690
back a decade or so ago,
it,

335
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,830
they allocated $3 billion to
sequence the first person's genome.

336
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:10,000
Uh, and they didn't get it done. They
didn't complete it. Craig Ventnor,

337
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:14,440
a a world famous biologist came
in and worked on the project,

338
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:17,200
built upon the work done by
the human genome project,

339
00:20:17,201 --> 00:20:22,201
and he was able to sequence in full the
first human being for a cost of $300

340
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,720
million about 10 years ago.
And fast forward to today,

341
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:29,980
you can actually get a full
genetic sequencing for $1,000.

342
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:34,120
And there are companies like 23 and
me that will offer you partial genetic

343
00:20:34,121 --> 00:20:38,620
sequencing for just $99. Uh,
without a doubt, within a few years,

344
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,480
it'll be the price of a cup of coffee.

345
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,820
Everybody will have their
full genetic sequence.

346
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:47,050
So that's great news for medicine,
right? Uh, every cancer can be treated.

347
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:52,360
You will know your proclivities
for certain diseases.
We'll be able to, you know,

348
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:57,040
have really massive impacts on health
care. But there's a flip side of that.

349
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:02,250
When it cost $3 billion to sequence the
human genome and pieces of equipment to

350
00:21:03,131 --> 00:21:05,560
do that,
we're in the tens of millions of dollars.

351
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:10,120
Only the government or the wealthiest
universities could afford that. Now,

352
00:21:10,121 --> 00:21:15,121
equipment that's sold on Ebay a year ago
for $100,000 can be bought for 10,000

353
00:21:15,971 --> 00:21:17,110
or a thousand today.

354
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:22,530
That is putting the tools of genetics
and synthetic biology in the hands of the

355
00:21:23,171 --> 00:21:23,801
common man.

356
00:21:23,801 --> 00:21:28,000
So they're actually high school clubs
that are doing a genetic sequencing today,

357
00:21:28,001 --> 00:21:30,940
right? They have lots of groups.
There's something called [inaudible],

358
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:34,600
which is a high school in college
competition that focuses on this. So it's,

359
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:37,900
today's kids are very much at the
cutting edge of science. And again,

360
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:41,500
they'll do all different types of
cool stuff. At singularity university,

361
00:21:41,501 --> 00:21:45,370
we had a startup that was grating up glow
in the dark plant because they thought

362
00:21:45,371 --> 00:21:47,560
it would be cool,
let's do that and you can do that.

363
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:50,350
But the challenge with these things are,
is that nuts?

364
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:55,120
Not everybody playing with these tools,
whether it be genetics, synthetic biology,

365
00:21:55,121 --> 00:21:55,721
robotics,

366
00:21:55,721 --> 00:22:00,670
artificial intelligence is of a kind
heart and there are criminals and

367
00:22:00,671 --> 00:22:05,140
terrorists and bad guys that now for the
first time have access to these tools

368
00:22:05,141 --> 00:22:08,710
and I know you're chomping at the bit
so I'll shut up for a second and then

369
00:22:08,711 --> 00:22:11,260
happy to give some examples of
what bad guys are doing with bio.

370
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,350
Okay.
We're going to come right back to,

371
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,690
I want to ask a very personal
question which is so 23 in me.

372
00:22:17,691 --> 00:22:22,691
I've always been nervous about having
my own name associated with genetic data

373
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:25,650
and so,
uh,

374
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:29,240
I have thought to myself and
talked with other people about,

375
00:22:29,241 --> 00:22:33,980
well perhaps you should have a friend
pay for your 23 and me who is of a

376
00:22:33,981 --> 00:22:37,880
different gender so that if
that data is ever compromised,

377
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:42,940
it's tossed out a or misattributed
or using a pseudonym,

378
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:47,690
let's say with an authorized account
under a separate credit card,

379
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:52,370
et Cetera, shipped to an address that
isn't associated with your name. So that,

380
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:56,540
that, that data cannot be used
against you in some fashion. Is that,

381
00:22:56,630 --> 00:23:00,800
is that para, is that paranoia
or is that preparedness? Is that,

382
00:23:00,801 --> 00:23:04,490
is that a practical thing in your mind
or something else? I'm just curious

383
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:05,641
fits paranoia.

384
00:23:05,641 --> 00:23:09,660
You and I are both paranoid because that's
the exact advice I give to my friends

385
00:23:09,661 --> 00:23:10,770
that want to do the test.

386
00:23:10,771 --> 00:23:14,310
So I don't know whether or not this
violates their terms and services.

387
00:23:14,311 --> 00:23:19,311
But the simple fact of the matter is we
have no idea how they're going to use

388
00:23:19,741 --> 00:23:20,880
that genetic information.

389
00:23:20,881 --> 00:23:23,670
And there are lots of sites out there
on some I mentioned in the book,

390
00:23:23,671 --> 00:23:25,500
one is called patients like me,

391
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:29,100
patients like me was a medical site
where people were meant to be sharing

392
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:32,490
confidential medical information
with each other and you know,

393
00:23:32,491 --> 00:23:35,130
get help for particularly rarer diseases.

394
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:38,760
And they had something called the mood
form where people were talking about

395
00:23:38,761 --> 00:23:41,190
psychotic breaks,
suicidality and the like.

396
00:23:41,191 --> 00:23:42,960
And it turns out the folks
that were running it,

397
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:46,700
we're actually releasing all of that
information. Insurance companies,

398
00:23:46,701 --> 00:23:50,570
and it was mentioned very clearly in
their terms of service that they do. So.

399
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:55,040
So you think you may be doing something
that's safe and secure and private,

400
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:58,820
but in fact, often you're not. So I would
always look at the terms of services.

401
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,930
Again, I don't know what the terms of
services are for 23 and me specifically,

402
00:24:02,931 --> 00:24:06,620
but I would say the following,
if I wanted to get genetic testing,

403
00:24:06,621 --> 00:24:11,180
I definitely share your concern and
would not be doing it under my own name

404
00:24:11,181 --> 00:24:14,300
because we simply don't know
where this technology is going.

405
00:24:14,301 --> 00:24:17,900
We have a Nivea Tay about, you know,
the future and what it might look like.

406
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:19,910
I'm not sure if you ever
saw the movie Gattica.

407
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:24,570
Uh, I, I've seen the previews
so that as far as I've gone,

408
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,590
the short story is,

409
00:24:25,591 --> 00:24:29,940
it's kind of a dystopian future where
everybody is judged based upon their DNA.

410
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:34,200
So let's say you want to be a scientist
or you want to be an astronaut based

411
00:24:34,201 --> 00:24:37,530
upon your genetic profile, they'll
say, nope, you know what, Tim,

412
00:24:37,531 --> 00:24:39,120
you're not quite what we're looking for.

413
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,960
And everybody's social strata is
determined by their DNA and what that,

414
00:24:42,961 --> 00:24:47,010
what people presume that means.
So I'd won't say that exactly.

415
00:24:47,011 --> 00:24:49,530
We'll be living in the Gatica future.
But for example,

416
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:54,600
if there are genetic markers for, um,
uh, sexual orientation for example,

417
00:24:54,601 --> 00:24:56,160
which some people suggest there are,

418
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:01,200
there are definitely a genetic markers
for predispositions to violence,

419
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:03,990
could be for schizophrenia
and other diseases.

420
00:25:03,991 --> 00:25:08,360
So the opportunities from a
public policy, law and ethics, um,

421
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,190
perspective to have your genetic material,

422
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:15,920
a leak or the information about you and
get out into the public sphere and I'm

423
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:19,590
sure will happen. You know,
we know today, uh, that, uh,

424
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:23,430
presidential candidates are forced one
way or the other to release their medical

425
00:25:23,431 --> 00:25:26,670
records to show that they're
fit and ready for office. Uh,

426
00:25:26,671 --> 00:25:30,630
I guarantee that that will be happening
with presidential genomes in the future.

427
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:34,920
Uh, and in fact, I talked about this, I
wrote an article with two friends of mine,

428
00:25:34,921 --> 00:25:38,650
Steven Kotler, who you may know, and
Andrew Hessel as synthetic biologists.

429
00:25:38,651 --> 00:25:42,900
And it was in the Atlantic monthly and
it was called hacking the president's DNA

430
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,610
and was all about what those risks
would look like. And the, uh, the, uh,

431
00:25:47,611 --> 00:25:51,610
number of bio threats that
could be launched if you
had access to somebody whose

432
00:25:51,611 --> 00:25:53,280
genetic material.
So for most folks,

433
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,800
I don't think they have to
worry about biohacking today,

434
00:25:55,801 --> 00:26:00,390
but from a privacy perspective, I think
I would definitely take precautions.

435
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:05,420
And the ones that you mentioned about
using a prepaid credit card for example,

436
00:26:05,431 --> 00:26:09,870
or having it shipped to a third party
and all of that stuff I think are good

437
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:11,940
logical,
common sense steps to take.

438
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:16,260
So what are some other uh, yeah,
and just for what it's worth,

439
00:26:16,261 --> 00:26:17,630
I want to do like a,

440
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:22,020
an urban myth check here because of
course I get all excited about this stuff.

441
00:26:22,021 --> 00:26:27,021
And when I was doing a research for the
four hour chef and became fascinated by

442
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:30,090
marksmanship and hunting,

443
00:26:30,091 --> 00:26:33,930
of course that very quickly leads to
the prepper communities and there's the

444
00:26:33,931 --> 00:26:38,340
good, bad and the ugly there. Uh, and
there were some very extreme edge cases,

445
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:39,361
but,
uh,

446
00:26:39,361 --> 00:26:44,361
I was speaking with a very well
credentialed and the example he gave was a

447
00:26:45,841 --> 00:26:47,190
personalized weapon.

448
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:51,870
Doesn't have to be a
synthetically engineered,

449
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:57,000
super fancy Psi Phi like dart
or pill or anything like that.

450
00:26:57,001 --> 00:26:57,840
It could be that you know,

451
00:26:57,841 --> 00:27:02,841
someone's predisposed to a disease and
that you can accelerate the onset of,

452
00:27:03,691 --> 00:27:08,400
say, a neurodegenerative disease by
blowing molybdenum into their face at a,

453
00:27:08,401 --> 00:27:10,720
at a, at a public event where
they wouldn't even, they,

454
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,660
they might not even register
that that's what happened.

455
00:27:12,661 --> 00:27:14,390
But if you want it to say,
take a longterm,

456
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,270
short position on their stock and they're
running a publicly traded company that

457
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:21,300
it doesn't have to be that type of crime,

458
00:27:21,301 --> 00:27:25,290
doesn't need to be the implement the
diagnostics and the determining of the

459
00:27:25,291 --> 00:27:29,130
target could be sophisticated,
but the actual attack does not have to be,

460
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:32,310
uh,
something futuristic.

461
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:34,850
I agree with that.
I'll give you a perfect example.

462
00:27:34,851 --> 00:27:36,440
There's a medicine called Warfarin,

463
00:27:36,441 --> 00:27:38,360
which is a blood thinner
and there's a certain,

464
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:42,800
a small percentage of people that have a
genetic marker that makes them allergic

465
00:27:42,801 --> 00:27:46,670
to that and it's deadly if taken.
So that would be a perfect example.

466
00:27:46,671 --> 00:27:48,860
It's a common pharmaceutical.
They exist today.

467
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,800
And it's not something that you
can see by looking at somebody,

468
00:27:51,801 --> 00:27:53,420
whether or not they're
allergic to Warfarin,

469
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:57,650
but if ingested right now you have that
additional piece of information and you

470
00:27:57,651 --> 00:27:59,090
know about it and it could be fatal.

471
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:03,250
Yeah. Yeah. That's crazy. I mean, yeah,

472
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:06,270
and I think so don't do that. Kids. Yeah.

473
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,450
Don't commit bio homicide

474
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:13,100
and, uh, you know, it's also
a, it brings up, uh, and I,

475
00:28:13,101 --> 00:28:15,030
and I want you to give some examples,

476
00:28:15,031 --> 00:28:19,380
but a misconception I think that a
lot of people have about criminals or

477
00:28:19,381 --> 00:28:22,530
particularly a terrorist specifically,
and that is that they're,

478
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:25,560
they're just uneducated.
Uh,

479
00:28:25,561 --> 00:28:28,980
and maybe you can shed some light here,

480
00:28:28,981 --> 00:28:32,970
but it seems that there actually
seems to be a disproportionately high

481
00:28:32,971 --> 00:28:34,470
percentage of very,
very,

482
00:28:34,471 --> 00:28:39,390
very well educated people
who then are recruited, uh,

483
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:44,180
by, uh, Milton groups as,
you know, operatives or,

484
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:48,870
or terrorists. It, it's, it's, uh,
I think people underestimate the,

485
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:53,490
perhaps the, the, the
intellectual horsepower of, of,

486
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:57,320
of some people who could perpetrate
these types of crimes. Um,

487
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,440
but I would love to hear,
certainly examples. Um,

488
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:04,430
you mentioned you might have a
couple of different examples. Sure.

489
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,433
Which I'd love to hear.

490
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:07,830
Yeah. I mean, on the terrorist
front, you're exactly right.

491
00:29:07,831 --> 00:29:10,200
People tend to underestimate them.
You know,

492
00:29:10,201 --> 00:29:14,070
when we were first going into Iraq and
Afghanistan where talked about people

493
00:29:14,071 --> 00:29:16,170
with towels on their
heads living in caves,

494
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:19,170
and what could they possibly do
to defeat us? And as we saw it,

495
00:29:19,171 --> 00:29:22,740
they were able to put up quite a
hell of a fight. Uh, and you know,

496
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:23,603
[inaudible] Hawaii,

497
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:28,140
I'll just where hearing who was a Osama
bin Ladin as number two was an MD.

498
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:30,180
He was a trained physician,
right?

499
00:29:30,181 --> 00:29:34,950
So there are any number of doctors that
are in these terrorist organizations.

500
00:29:34,951 --> 00:29:37,950
We've seen them recruiting
specifically on tourists, chalkboards.

501
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,500
They're looking for people
with scientific backgrounds,

502
00:29:40,501 --> 00:29:44,770
with technological backgrounds. One
terrorist up by the name of your hobby,

503
00:29:44,771 --> 00:29:48,430
double o seven, he took the double
o seven from James Bond, uh,

504
00:29:48,431 --> 00:29:52,780
and he was like basically the CIO for
al Qaeda for a while running their

505
00:29:52,781 --> 00:29:56,380
technology. Uh, in the wake
of the Snowden disclosures,

506
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:59,730
there's been a ton of chatter
on terrorists chat boards, uh,

507
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:03,820
talking about the importance of
encryption. So they follow the news very,

508
00:30:03,821 --> 00:30:06,940
very closely and are
paying attention to it.

509
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:11,770
They show tremendous sophistication.
And let's go back to bio, for example,

510
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,960
the terrorist organization,

511
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:18,990
I'm Sham Reiki of the folks that
carried out the 1995 exactly.

512
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:23,470
Severin get hustle on the Tokyo
subway that occurred at 95.

513
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:28,030
What most people didn't realize about
[inaudible] Rinko is the fact that they

514
00:30:28,031 --> 00:30:32,600
had a bio weapons project.
They spent $1 million a year for,

515
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:37,710
for 10 years from 1985 to 1995 trying
to develop a powerful bio weapon.

516
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:41,680
And the science wasn't there yet
for them to be able to do it.

517
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:44,950
That's why they went with the
chemical sarin gas attack today.

518
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:49,270
Things like that would be much more
trivial given the wide availability of

519
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:53,680
biotoxins and other type of infectious
threats that are available online.

520
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,840
The code is there,
you can download it,

521
00:30:55,841 --> 00:31:00,460
basically build some of these things in
your basement or garage and release them.

522
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:02,960
In other area where we see terrorists,
uh,

523
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:07,690
playing in really interesting ways are
both robotics and social media and open

524
00:31:07,691 --> 00:31:10,990
source intelligence.
And I'll just give a few crazy examples.

525
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:16,260
So during the terror attack
at the Westgate Mall that
occurred in Nairobi about

526
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:20,550
a year ago, we saw a, the
tourists from all Shabaab.

527
00:31:20,551 --> 00:31:25,000
The militants were incredibly
sophisticated in how they
were using social media

528
00:31:25,001 --> 00:31:25,900
and Twitter.

529
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:30,400
They were live tweeting the entire
event and they were actually mocking the

530
00:31:30,401 --> 00:31:33,880
Kenyan police force and military
guards throughout the incident,

531
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,800
putting out information,
uh,

532
00:31:35,801 --> 00:31:40,510
adding to the confusion and Isis or the
Islamic state has been doing the same

533
00:31:40,511 --> 00:31:43,270
exact thing you mentioned earlier.

534
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:47,830
Also the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attack.
In my humble opinion,

535
00:31:47,831 --> 00:31:52,240
that was perhaps one of the
most sophisticated terrorist
attacks we've seen to

536
00:31:52,241 --> 00:31:54,950
date. From a technological
perspective, uh,

537
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:58,150
10 terrorists were able to keep a city,

538
00:31:58,151 --> 00:32:03,151
a metropolitan area of 20 million people
completely shut down for 60 hours.

539
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:08,440
So 10 guys not just armed with
standard weapons. Ak 47 it's RDX,

540
00:32:08,441 --> 00:32:12,400
explosives, hand grenades. But
these guys had night vision goggles.

541
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:16,540
They had satellite phones, satellite
imagery, encrypted blackberries.

542
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:21,570
They use Skype type of voice
communications during the
incident because they had

543
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:25,720
all that technology.
They had phenomenal situational awareness,

544
00:32:25,721 --> 00:32:29,980
situational awareness that beat the
capacity of the Indian national guard and

545
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:32,050
the Mumbai Police to respond.

546
00:32:32,051 --> 00:32:35,650
And they used it to great effect
to actually kill more people.

547
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:40,680
There's an example I talk about in the
book of a man called [inaudible] who was

548
00:32:41,451 --> 00:32:45,830
staying at the Taj Mahal Hotel in
Mumbai. Um, you may have been there.

549
00:32:45,831 --> 00:32:48,050
It's one of the most
beautiful hotels in the world.

550
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:51,650
And when the terrorist
took over the hotel,

551
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:55,430
they started going room to room
trying to find more hostages.

552
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:59,960
And they came across Mr Romo party who
was on the top floor in a suite at the

553
00:32:59,961 --> 00:33:03,530
Taj and they broke into his
room and they said to him, well,

554
00:33:03,531 --> 00:33:06,770
who are you and what are you doing
here? And he said, oh no, I'm nobody.

555
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:10,370
Leave me alone. I'm just an
innocent school teacher. Well,

556
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:13,700
the terrorists were dumb. But to
your point about not being that dumb,

557
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:18,830
they looked at this guy and staying in a
suite at the Taj Mahal, beautiful hotel,

558
00:33:18,831 --> 00:33:22,610
and they said, there's no way any Indian
school teacher could afford this suite.

559
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:27,440
They picked up his id at his bedside and
then they phoned it in via a satellite

560
00:33:27,441 --> 00:33:31,820
phone to the terrorist war room that was
set up across the border in Pakistan.

561
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:36,950
There in the war room, the terrorists
were monitoring, uh, live, uh, a,

562
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:40,700
they had ibn, uh, CNN, BBC,

563
00:33:40,701 --> 00:33:44,780
I'll just Syrah and a bank of computers
where they were doing real time research.

564
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:48,090
So you had the 10, uh, uh,
operatives from luxury aid,

565
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:52,460
Toiba al Qaeda affiliate based in Pakistan
that we're carrying out the attack,

566
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:55,370
uh, broken down into five
teams of two terrorists.

567
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:57,290
And then you had the tourist war room.

568
00:33:57,530 --> 00:34:00,800
So when they phoned in the name of
this guy to the tourist war room,

569
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:05,600
they simply googled him. They came
across his photograph. As it turns out,

570
00:34:05,601 --> 00:34:07,880
he was not a school teacher.
He was the head of the,

571
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:11,570
one of the second largest
banks in India called ing.

572
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,980
And they came across this photo.

573
00:34:12,981 --> 00:34:15,680
And then we know from the
intercepted conversation,

574
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:19,490
which we only discovered after the fact
that the terrorist war room said, hey,

575
00:34:19,491 --> 00:34:23,720
we found a picture of your guy
is your hostage heavyset? Yes.

576
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:27,950
Does he have glasses? Yes. Is he kind
of bald? Yes. Okay. We found him.

577
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:31,190
The terrorist then said to their
ops center, what shall we do?

578
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,770
And then the order came down,
kill him.

579
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,740
So the fact of the matter is,
back in 2008,

580
00:34:38,741 --> 00:34:43,741
terrorists were using search engines like
Google to determine who shall live and

581
00:34:44,051 --> 00:34:47,830
who shall die. And No, it's a black swan
event. And I know you talk about those.

582
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:51,220
The fact of the matter is, when you're
sharing and Facebook, it's not just,

583
00:34:51,221 --> 00:34:54,820
you know, the media and
marketing companies that you
need to be concerned about.

584
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:57,610
When you share openly,
everybody has access to this.

585
00:34:57,611 --> 00:34:58,840
And even though it's a black swan,

586
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,840
we're event that could be terrorist
organized criminals as well.

587
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,470
And I should, I think you, you, uh,

588
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,530
I think it's a terrifying example,

589
00:35:07,531 --> 00:35:12,531
particularly when you consider that
2008 was the stone ages compared to the,

590
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:17,010
the, um, the, the
implications of big data and,

591
00:35:17,011 --> 00:35:22,011
and a ubiquitous availability of tools
today and the sophistication certainly

592
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,160
have a lot of those tools,
uh,

593
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:28,570
including reverse image search and things
like that through Google or tonight or

594
00:35:28,571 --> 00:35:32,370
others. The, the Black Swan events. Also,

595
00:35:32,371 --> 00:35:36,480
just because a black swan
event is considered a black
swan event to the victims

596
00:35:36,481 --> 00:35:39,570
doesn't mean black swan event. Uh, I,

597
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:42,660
he a a low probability random event.

598
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:47,580
It could be completely engineered as it
was in this particular case through a

599
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:52,500
extensive preparations on the part
of the, of the terrorists. So the,

600
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,700
the, uh, I'd love to
talk a little bit about,

601
00:35:57,030 --> 00:36:01,950
uh, a, a phrase I've heard you mentioned
before and that is public safety is too

602
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:05,190
important to leave to the professionals.
So there,

603
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:08,670
there are a number of ways I'd
like to try to unpack that.

604
00:36:08,671 --> 00:36:13,090
The first is just as a, um, uh,

605
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:18,050
to try to bring out my
inner prepper. So in, in if,

606
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:21,090
if you live in San Francisco,

607
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:25,410
in a city like New York City
or San Francisco or Chicago,

608
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:29,790
what are the things that should be
keeping you up at night that you should be

609
00:36:29,791 --> 00:36:34,110
thinking about mitigating as
risks are Black Swan events?

610
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,120
Well, traffic, but it's
not a black swan events

611
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:42,030
keeps me up at night. Uh,
when I talked about that,

612
00:36:42,031 --> 00:36:45,090
I was speaking more broadly
about kind of the cyber threat,

613
00:36:45,091 --> 00:36:48,270
but it's also true in physical
space as well. I mean,

614
00:36:48,271 --> 00:36:53,271
the fact of the matter is that the line
between kind of order in society and

615
00:36:54,481 --> 00:36:57,090
chaos is actually quite
thin in law enforcement.

616
00:36:57,091 --> 00:37:01,320
They talk about the thin blue line and
I was a patrol officer in Los Angeles

617
00:37:01,321 --> 00:37:02,640
during the La Riots.

618
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:07,800
And what I realized is that the police
are in charge as long as the public wants

619
00:37:07,801 --> 00:37:11,580
them to be in charge. Once the public
decides that they are not in charge,

620
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:12,990
you are no longer in charge.

621
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:18,020
I think La had 1.7 police officers for
every hundred thousand citizens at that

622
00:37:18,961 --> 00:37:23,250
point. And so if you make the
citizens really, really mad, uh,

623
00:37:23,251 --> 00:37:25,410
as was the case during
the Rodney King incident,

624
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:30,030
then it's over and there's nothing
you can do. So, uh, in physical space,

625
00:37:30,031 --> 00:37:33,090
I mean all the basic stuff that you
talked about, the prepper movement,

626
00:37:33,091 --> 00:37:37,770
but the Red Cross would give you the
same type of advice or the California

627
00:37:37,771 --> 00:37:40,050
office of emergency services,
Fema.

628
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:43,470
There are any number of good checklists
out there about having water and food

629
00:37:43,471 --> 00:37:46,260
and, you know, just be prepared
to have an emergency plan.

630
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,500
All of that is really good and useful.

631
00:37:49,501 --> 00:37:52,380
And I also had unfortunately,
uh,

632
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:56,790
the opportunity to be in New York City
down at seven world trade on nine 11.

633
00:37:56,791 --> 00:38:01,090
So that was another experience
that I happen to have lived
through. And you know,

634
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:04,870
it that brought out the best of people
in that particular instance where you saw

635
00:38:04,871 --> 00:38:09,690
a total and complete strangers being as
warm and helpful to one another as they

636
00:38:09,691 --> 00:38:13,200
could. Um, so it can
really go both ways. Uh,

637
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:16,470
when I talk about public safety
being too important to leave to the

638
00:38:16,471 --> 00:38:19,010
professionals, what I
would say is that, uh,

639
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:24,080
people often abdicate their concept
of safety to the police or to the

640
00:38:24,391 --> 00:38:27,540
authorities and think that
everything will be just fine.

641
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:30,180
And mostly in our physical space,

642
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:34,800
in the developed world where we have rule
of law. So, you know, think Australia,

643
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:37,060
Western Europe, uh, you
know, in North America,

644
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:41,380
that's a system that works quite well.
If you look at what's going on, you know,

645
00:38:41,381 --> 00:38:46,060
with Al Shabaab and others in
Africa, it's a different story. But,

646
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:49,600
uh, in cyberspace it's a
complete, uh, you know,

647
00:38:49,601 --> 00:38:53,460
every man for himself type scenario.
What I find fascinating is,

648
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:55,360
is that from the most part,

649
00:38:55,361 --> 00:39:00,180
law enforcement has abdicated any
responsibility for cybercrime. Now,

650
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:03,340
I know that some of my colleagues
in law enforcement might, you know,

651
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:06,040
take issue with that and
certainly they're trying hard,

652
00:39:06,041 --> 00:39:10,900
but the volume of the threat and the
nature of the technology makes law

653
00:39:10,901 --> 00:39:15,430
enforcement, uh, nearly impossible as a
solution for the cyber threat. You know,

654
00:39:15,431 --> 00:39:20,020
I talk about law enforcement is a
nation state type solution, right?

655
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:23,860
A policemen in New York and not make
an arrest in Moscow and vice a versa.

656
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:28,600
And so law enforcement is a local
solution to a global problem.

657
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:30,760
So no matter how good the cops get,

658
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:33,970
even though there are organizations like
Interpol also that are trying to make a

659
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:36,700
difference,
they're just fundamentally mismatch.

660
00:39:36,701 --> 00:39:41,470
And that's what we need to deal with. You
know, if somebody came into your house,

661
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:45,250
uh, and broke into it and stole
something, you'd dial nine one one.

662
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:49,000
There's some kids spray painted your car
or your house, you'd call the police,

663
00:39:49,001 --> 00:39:51,130
you'd file a report for vandalism.

664
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:56,290
And yet we have the equivalent of these
things going on every single day in our

665
00:39:56,291 --> 00:39:59,740
homes and our computers on our
cell phones, on our tablets.

666
00:39:59,741 --> 00:40:02,560
And if you dialed nine one one
to report a computer virus,

667
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:07,430
the cops would come for you as opposed to
sending a car to investigate it. So, uh,

668
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:09,250
I think from that angle,

669
00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:14,380
we need to get average and
everyday citizens involved
in this. On the one hand,

670
00:40:14,381 --> 00:40:18,190
law enforcement has very
limited resources. It
doesn't work internationally.

671
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:22,210
And not all agencies are particularly
well schooled. On the cyber threat.

672
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,600
Whereas in, you know, this living
in San Francisco and Silicon Valley,

673
00:40:25,601 --> 00:40:30,580
there's tremendous talent in the
private sector that fully is versed in

674
00:40:30,581 --> 00:40:31,361
technology.

675
00:40:31,361 --> 00:40:35,950
There's a global community of people that
could contribute significantly to this

676
00:40:35,951 --> 00:40:40,360
problem. And I think that it'd be a
great opportunity to get them engaged.

677
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:44,680
And the last thing I would mention in
particularly since we are living so much

678
00:40:44,681 --> 00:40:46,480
of our lives online,
you know,

679
00:40:46,481 --> 00:40:51,481
staring at screens on our smart phones
or on our computers every single day,

680
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:55,720
there's a part of our life that
is taking place in cyberspace.

681
00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:00,640
And yet we don't have a Common Defense
Force for cyberspace. So, you know, a,

682
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:02,980
for a hundred years
we've had reserve army,

683
00:41:02,981 --> 00:41:05,350
we've had reserved and
auxiliary police officers.

684
00:41:05,351 --> 00:41:09,040
We don't have any equivalent
for that, uh, in cyberspace.

685
00:41:09,041 --> 00:41:11,200
And so when the big cyber attack comes,

686
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,400
we're going to have a paucity of
resources and talent to respond.

687
00:41:15,401 --> 00:41:19,330
So one of the things I call for is the
building of a national cyber reserve

688
00:41:19,331 --> 00:41:22,990
corps. Take average ordinary citizens,
men and women, young and old.

689
00:41:22,991 --> 00:41:25,120
It doesn't matter.
Put them through a background,

690
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:29,770
get them cleared and part of the solution
because we definitely need their help.

691
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:34,100
So I definitely want to
come back to that type of,

692
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:38,210
uh, distributed or
crowdsourced workforce. Uh,

693
00:41:38,211 --> 00:41:42,470
and on a, on a related note, I
want to talk a little bit about,

694
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:47,000
uh, the physical world.
So meet space and those

695
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:48,090
crowdsourcing.

696
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:50,690
We'll give you some great examples
when we come back about criminals.

697
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:51,613
Crowdsourcing.

698
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:54,850
Okay, great. And, and we can talk
about the counter forces to then also,

699
00:41:55,120 --> 00:42:00,120
so I remember going through a northern
emergency response team training course,

700
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:03,130
uh,
which was,

701
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:07,810
which was organized by the San
Francisco police and fire departments.

702
00:42:07,811 --> 00:42:11,640
So this was not a fringe group
teaching this class. Right.

703
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:15,090
And I remember him paraphrasing here,
but roughly they said they,

704
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:18,160
they pulled the audience said, okay,
how many people live in San Francisco?

705
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:22,320
How many fire engines do you think there
are? And it's something like, you know,

706
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:27,460
38 fire engines for us at,
at a minimum,

707
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:31,780
several hundred thousand people.
And the point they made was if there is a,

708
00:42:31,781 --> 00:42:35,260
if there is an issue in the
event of a real event, a,

709
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:39,400
let's just call it a seven point
or higher Richter scale earthquake,

710
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:43,480
you could go and very realistically could
expect to go seven to 10 days without

711
00:42:43,481 --> 00:42:46,900
food or water. Uh, and uh,
the, you know, the, the,

712
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:51,820
the fact that um, the, the Lord
of the flies type scenario,

713
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:55,960
while unlikely is not as
unlikely as people might think.

714
00:42:55,961 --> 00:43:00,961
And I recall when I was writing a section
of the four hour chef called the wild

715
00:43:01,331 --> 00:43:05,770
section was all about sort of
forging and hunting and uh,

716
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:08,710
preparing food without
the use of the kitchen.

717
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:13,870
I got went down the,
the prepper rat hole pretty quickly.

718
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:18,790
And uh, I remember having, uh, some
editorial feedback from the publisher,

719
00:43:18,791 --> 00:43:21,430
which was critical of how
deep I went into this stuff.

720
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:25,120
And just at that moment when I
was being told that I was, uh,

721
00:43:25,121 --> 00:43:28,960
it was too alarmist and too extreme,
hurricane sandy hit New York City.

722
00:43:29,410 --> 00:43:31,090
And,
uh,

723
00:43:31,091 --> 00:43:36,091
it was just a perfect illustration of
how ill prepared most people were a for

724
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:38,650
what is going to be, uh, a,

725
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:41,980
an increasingly common
occurrence with climate change,

726
00:43:41,981 --> 00:43:44,380
at least according to a
lot of scientists who,

727
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:49,530
who've looked at the modeling of say
a hundred year storms and how it might

728
00:43:49,841 --> 00:43:53,760
occur every decade or even
more frequently. But let
me, let me ask you, um,

729
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:58,420
do you think having your mentioning
mentioning biochemical a weapons or

730
00:43:58,421 --> 00:44:00,970
biological agents and
how people, uh, it's,

731
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:05,110
it's become increasingly easy in a way to,
uh,

732
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:09,280
to fabricate these or to, to
engineer them. Do you, uh,

733
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:14,400
do you think having iodine tablets
and a gas masks at home is,

734
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:17,350
is overkill if you live
in a metropolitan area?

735
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:19,030
I guess it would,

736
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:22,780
I would say it depends on your philosophy
in life and how you choose to live

737
00:44:22,781 --> 00:44:24,760
your life. You were talking
about, uh, you know,

738
00:44:24,761 --> 00:44:27,580
30 or 40 fire engines for
the city of San Francisco.

739
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:32,550
There were nights when I was working with
the LAPD on Morning Watch to eight and

740
00:44:32,551 --> 00:44:35,880
for a precinct that had
400,000 people living in it,

741
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:39,570
we had three police cars on the road.
So in that precinct,

742
00:44:39,571 --> 00:44:42,510
now we had other guys and other
precincts that we could call, but that's,

743
00:44:42,511 --> 00:44:47,280
you know, three police cars,
six guys and Gals, you know,
for 400,000 people. So yes,

744
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,340
the thin blue line can
be quite thin at times.

745
00:44:50,341 --> 00:44:54,420
And I'm always encouraging of people
to be prepared to have a plan,

746
00:44:54,421 --> 00:44:58,950
to be cognizant of the threats.
Now you can take that to an extreme.

747
00:44:58,951 --> 00:45:01,980
You can't say, I have to have a
bunker. I need to live underground.

748
00:45:01,981 --> 00:45:04,620
We need to be prepared for it.
You know, nuclear Armageddon.

749
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:07,800
And that's not the way that
I choose to live my life.

750
00:45:07,801 --> 00:45:12,570
But I think common sense tools, first
aid kit, having iodine, perhaps,

751
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:13,950
uh, Opportunity, uh,

752
00:45:13,951 --> 00:45:17,950
to have tablets to make sure that
you have access to clean water, um,

753
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:21,660
that's decontaminate it and things like
that. I think that just is logical.

754
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:24,750
I don't think there's anything
over the top about that at all

755
00:45:26,530 --> 00:45:29,860
with international travel. Um, and uh,

756
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:33,830
we're not going to get into necessarily
kidnapping and all of that, but I wanna,

757
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:37,390
I wanna I wanna use this as a [inaudible],
not have a great kidnapping example.

758
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:40,510
We'll, all right, well if you're going
to dangle that carrot in front of him,

759
00:45:40,511 --> 00:45:44,220
let's go there. So I went, no, I want to
hear the kidnapping example. Let's do it.

760
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,940
So this is just something that occurred
in Mexico City a couple of years ago

761
00:45:47,941 --> 00:45:51,290
when smart phones were first
starting to come in. Um,

762
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:54,300
the cops in Mexico noticed a
phenomena that was really weird.

763
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:56,040
So I'm sure this has happened to you.

764
00:45:56,041 --> 00:46:00,210
You get off an airplane in other city
and somebody is holding a piece of

765
00:46:00,211 --> 00:46:04,480
cardboard with your name on it and you
walk up to them. Have you done that? Yeah.

766
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:07,440
So guess what?
Cardboard can be hacked.

767
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:12,870
Sometimes people lie and sometimes the
person holding the sign is not the person

768
00:46:12,871 --> 00:46:15,780
that you expect them to be.
So about three years ago,

769
00:46:15,781 --> 00:46:19,410
four years ago in Mexico City when
smart phones first came out, uh,

770
00:46:19,411 --> 00:46:24,270
organized crime groups and Narcos were
hanging out at the Mexico City Airport.

771
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:26,730
And with all the signs up,
they said,

772
00:46:26,731 --> 00:46:30,900
Mr. Smith from Dow Chemicals and
Mrs. Jones from, you know, uh,

773
00:46:30,901 --> 00:46:32,220
whatever the company may be,

774
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:36,600
the bad guys were sitting there and they
were using their smartphones to Google

775
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:40,770
the people whose names were on the
signs and looking for those that they

776
00:46:40,771 --> 00:46:44,880
estimate it to be of the greatest net
worth. Once they figured out who that was,

777
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:49,970
the criminals were going up to the
chauffeurs and saying, you know,

778
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:53,610
here's 100 pesos. Get outta here and
we'll kill you or we'll kill you.

779
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:57,480
And they were taking the cardboard sign,
the executive flying in from New York,

780
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,850
San Francisco,
London would then get off the plane,

781
00:46:59,970 --> 00:47:01,800
see the piece of cardboard
with her name on it,

782
00:47:01,801 --> 00:47:04,220
walk up to the person who
also took the limousine,

783
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:08,620
was dressed like a limousine driver,
got into a car and was kidnapped, uh,

784
00:47:08,621 --> 00:47:12,810
as a result. And they were actually a few
people that were killed. So my point is,

785
00:47:12,811 --> 00:47:15,270
is that most people are very
trusting and they should be.

786
00:47:15,271 --> 00:47:17,070
That's the way you want to live life.
Then you know,

787
00:47:17,071 --> 00:47:19,170
you want to be happy and
think about that stuff.

788
00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:23,460
But when everybody thinks like that,
those who think differently, for example,

789
00:47:23,461 --> 00:47:24,930
criminals,
terrorists and others,

790
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:29,380
it's really easy to subvert the
system and cardboard can be hacked.

791
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:33,630
Yup. It's, uh, I hadn't
heard that specific example,

792
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:38,631
but that is yet another reason for me to
use pseudonyms when using car services,

793
00:47:40,910 --> 00:47:42,880
uh, which, which I do. Um,

794
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:46,260
I have done for the last couple of
years just because I've had some weird

795
00:47:46,261 --> 00:47:50,910
experiences with travel.
Uh, even though, uh,

796
00:47:51,090 --> 00:47:51,960
you know,
this is where,

797
00:47:51,961 --> 00:47:56,250
this is where the Internet really fucks
me because people think people can't run

798
00:47:56,251 --> 00:47:59,670
publishing numbers.
They don't understand book economics.

799
00:47:59,671 --> 00:48:02,400
So they think I have like a hundred
billion dollars and I'm like,

800
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:08,640
you got the wrong guy.
But, uh, the, the, uh,

801
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:11,620
oh God. Yeah, the, the, the
kidnappings. Terrifying. I,

802
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:16,140
I know I have known people in Argentina
and in other countries who have been

803
00:48:16,650 --> 00:48:21,030
kidnapped or, or, or Columbia,
Brazil, very, very, extremely common.

804
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:24,510
I know many people who've had family
members or friends kidnapped in south and

805
00:48:24,511 --> 00:48:29,130
Central America, the um, in certainly
not exclusive to this places at all.

806
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:30,400
But the,

807
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:35,750
the question I was going to ask you
is a segway to a virtual attacks and,

808
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:41,800
uh, one of the startups that, uh, I'm,

809
00:48:41,801 --> 00:48:45,000
I'm close to is it used to be
called reputation defender.

810
00:48:45,001 --> 00:48:47,730
It's now reputation.com.
And uh,

811
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:51,450
one of the executives there told me that
when he travels to China on business,

812
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:56,630
he will use a brand new throwaway netbook
because he does not want any of his

813
00:48:58,021 --> 00:49:01,530
data compromised on his, uh,
on his hardware, you know,

814
00:49:01,531 --> 00:49:04,730
if he brings a laptop with him.
Um,

815
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:07,710
if someone is traveling, uh, let's just,

816
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:09,570
let's just say it's a
business person there,

817
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:13,770
they're traveling to any
number of countries, but
let's just assume it's China.

818
00:49:13,771 --> 00:49:17,010
What are the precautions
that they might take, uh,

819
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:22,250
to try to prevent any infiltration of
their data or sensitive information?

820
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:25,020
Yeah, that is an awesome,
awesome question.

821
00:49:25,021 --> 00:49:28,740
And it's one that people don't think
about, uh, nearly often enough. You know,

822
00:49:28,741 --> 00:49:33,150
whether it be an executive from Houston
or New York City or those in Silicon

823
00:49:33,150 --> 00:49:35,790
Valley, obviously business,
we'll take them to, you know,

824
00:49:35,791 --> 00:49:38,820
the most populous nation on earth,
the People's Republic of China.

825
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:43,170
And there the rules are very different
in terms of what the so called police can

826
00:49:43,171 --> 00:49:46,110
do and how they will treat
you and your technology.

827
00:49:46,111 --> 00:49:49,500
So all I would say is if you're
going over there for business,

828
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:51,510
play close attention.

829
00:49:51,511 --> 00:49:55,770
The fact of the matter is
they're screening of you
begins when you fill out your

830
00:49:55,771 --> 00:49:58,860
visa application, right?
It's nothing there is random.

831
00:49:58,861 --> 00:50:01,230
So why do you have to
do a visa application?

832
00:50:01,231 --> 00:50:03,540
Because they want to know who you are.
And if you're interesting,

833
00:50:03,541 --> 00:50:06,330
and if you're Andy Grove from
Intel traveling into China,

834
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:10,400
they're going to pay attention to you.
And I'll give you one simple example. Uh,

835
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:14,340
and this was reported several years ago.
Andy Grove, the former chairman of Intel,

836
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:16,500
actually took a flight into Beijing.

837
00:50:16,501 --> 00:50:20,180
He gave a lecture before
thousand people and uh,

838
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:25,220
presented from his laptop after his
presentation was over a two very young,

839
00:50:25,610 --> 00:50:27,000
uh,
pretty Chinese women,

840
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:32,180
him and they were ever so subtly just
moving their own bodies to get him to turn

841
00:50:32,181 --> 00:50:36,530
away from his own laptop. He had a lovely
conversation and when he turned around,

842
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:38,060
his laptop was gone.

843
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:42,290
Now the big mistake in that particular
case is not that he brought a laptop per

844
00:50:42,291 --> 00:50:44,810
se,
but as the chairman of Intel,

845
00:50:44,811 --> 00:50:48,920
he actually had the designs for
one of the latest pentium chips.

846
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:53,180
Extremely valuable intellectual
property on the computer,

847
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:58,340
the disappeared along with the laptop.
So my general rule of thumb is, you know,

848
00:50:58,341 --> 00:51:00,680
laptops as you, you know,
net books, whatever they are,

849
00:51:00,681 --> 00:51:04,310
they're just a couple of hundred bucks
today. If you can afford a trip to China,

850
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:08,750
you should be able to afford a laptop.
You can bring a dummy phone with you.

851
00:51:08,751 --> 00:51:11,270
And just to give you an idea of
some of the information that leaks,

852
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:16,010
the minute you connect to a hotel
in a potentially hostile territory,

853
00:51:16,011 --> 00:51:20,000
whether it be Iran, China, you know,
whatever country you're traveling too,

854
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:25,870
they have the ability to insert malware
onto both your phone and your computer

855
00:51:25,911 --> 00:51:28,910
the minute your device connects
to their network. So you know,

856
00:51:28,911 --> 00:51:31,730
when you have to log in to
the hotel webpage to pay,

857
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:35,750
that's when the handshake takes place and
that's when your device gets infected.

858
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,100
So that step one,

859
00:51:37,370 --> 00:51:41,270
if you go ahead and leave
your laptop in any hotel safe,

860
00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:45,920
routinely the hotel security
gives access to the local police.

861
00:51:45,921 --> 00:51:47,390
So they all know the combinations.

862
00:51:47,391 --> 00:51:51,260
Anybody can open up one of
those saves incredibly easily.

863
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:55,640
So what I would recommend
is if you bring technology,

864
00:51:55,670 --> 00:51:58,760
carry it on you, uh, if
you want to hold onto it,

865
00:51:58,761 --> 00:52:01,730
I wouldn't limit the amount
of information you put on it.

866
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,140
I would certainly consider what we call
a throwaway laptop or mobile phone and I

867
00:52:06,141 --> 00:52:08,810
would make sure that those
devices were encrypted.

868
00:52:08,811 --> 00:52:11,300
If you know you're going to call
10 people when you're over there,

869
00:52:11,301 --> 00:52:14,780
have those 10 phone numbers and don't
walk out there with all of your contacts,

870
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:17,570
with your business plans,
with your sales figures.

871
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:21,010
The thing that mostly the Chinese
are interested in besides, uh,

872
00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:25,520
intellectual property is they're very
aggressive about being helpful to their

873
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:26,990
state back industry.

874
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:31,070
So if you're over there as an American
businessman or woman or regardless of

875
00:52:31,071 --> 00:52:33,830
what country you're from and you're
negotiating a deal with the Chinese,

876
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:36,830
there'll be very careful
about monitoring your email,

877
00:52:36,831 --> 00:52:40,730
what you're doing and any negotiations
that you may be having with your

878
00:52:40,731 --> 00:52:43,250
counterparts from your own
company in the United States,

879
00:52:43,251 --> 00:52:45,350
whether it be your general counsel,
the head of sales,

880
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:49,910
they're going to take that information
and feed it to their Chinese equivalent.

881
00:52:50,270 --> 00:52:52,220
Uh, in order to do that. And in fact,

882
00:52:52,221 --> 00:52:56,630
there was a case that I mentioned in the
book where an executive from Coca Cola

883
00:52:56,631 --> 00:53:01,190
got fished with a spear phishing email
and they were in a multibillion dollar

884
00:53:01,191 --> 00:53:05,180
deal with a Chinese beverage, a state
sponsored Chinese beverage company,

885
00:53:05,450 --> 00:53:07,790
and they were under bid and lost out.

886
00:53:07,791 --> 00:53:11,750
So one phishing email to the right
executive crafted in the right way,

887
00:53:11,751 --> 00:53:15,530
infected the computer and then the deal
was done and billions of dollars were

888
00:53:15,531 --> 00:53:16,080
lost.

889
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:20,960
Wow. So the phishing email was
something like whatever it might be, uh,

890
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:25,200
your, your account is overdrawn to the
Bank of America. Click here to confirm.

891
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:29,930
And if I could just give one general tip,
something to keep in mind. And you know,

892
00:53:29,931 --> 00:53:32,340
I don't know everybody that's
going to listen to your podcasts,

893
00:53:32,341 --> 00:53:36,800
but I'm going to postulate that most of
your listeners actually do not know it.

894
00:53:36,801 --> 00:53:40,700
Prince in Nigeria, if you get an
email from a prince in Nigeria,

895
00:53:40,701 --> 00:53:43,730
do not click on it. He's not
your friend. He doesn't know you.

896
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:47,920
Yeah, very good advice.
Very, very good advice. Yeah,

897
00:53:47,950 --> 00:53:52,820
the opportunity cost of missing the real
email from the prince in Nigeria pretty,

898
00:53:53,390 --> 00:53:55,450
pretty low when you look
at the probabilities.

899
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:58,190
But you hit on something major
right there, which is actually,

900
00:53:58,191 --> 00:54:02,690
that is one of the major causes of
infections to people's computers is that

901
00:54:02,691 --> 00:54:04,190
they're clicking on the wrong link.

902
00:54:04,191 --> 00:54:07,370
And in the old days you used to be able
to tell a phishing email because they

903
00:54:07,371 --> 00:54:09,920
use bad language, bad
English, bad grammar.

904
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:13,580
Now they're perfectly well crafted
and a spear phishing email targeting,

905
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:17,480
targeting a specific individual
or executive is even more so.

906
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:19,670
So you have to really careful.
Basically,

907
00:54:19,671 --> 00:54:23,420
my general rule of thumb is don't click
on links. If people send me a link,

908
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:26,930
I'll call them and say, Hey, did you send
this to me? And they think I'm crazy,

909
00:54:26,931 --> 00:54:28,040
but I don't click on links.

910
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:33,230
Yeah. Well did Ditto for attachments,
which can be executable files.

911
00:54:33,290 --> 00:54:38,270
Uh, the, uh, okay. So
I have a, I'm going to,

912
00:54:38,390 --> 00:54:43,390
I'm going to ask about an edge case
because I love asking these absurd or

913
00:54:43,731 --> 00:54:47,990
extreme questions,
but if someone has an unlimited,

914
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:50,210
a nearly unlimited or unlimited budget,

915
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:54,590
let's just say it's a hedge fund
manager who's worth $1 billion plus,

916
00:54:55,460 --> 00:55:00,460
and you are their personal sort of a
security consultant and you can interpret

917
00:55:01,311 --> 00:55:04,130
that any way you'd like, uh, uh,

918
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:07,940
security slash sort of a Armageddon
proofing consultant. What are,

919
00:55:08,030 --> 00:55:10,130
what are some of the things
that you would have them do?

920
00:55:10,690 --> 00:55:14,890
I would have them hire a guy who didn't
discuss their security plan on a podcast

921
00:55:14,891 --> 00:55:19,450
with Tim Ferriss. I first piece
of advice. Right. Good advice.

922
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:24,280
Don't do that. Um, but generally
speaking, uh, you know,

923
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:28,420
every person you work with
is a unique and different,

924
00:55:28,421 --> 00:55:31,930
so I work with a lot of folks have
high net worth and a lot of the general

925
00:55:31,931 --> 00:55:36,931
public corporations and the advice is
very specific on what people's threats

926
00:55:37,271 --> 00:55:39,990
are. So for some people the
biggest threat, you know,

927
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,080
to a hedge fund manager may be that
their son or daughter is addicted to meth

928
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:46,250
and that's bringing all types of other,
you know,

929
00:55:46,251 --> 00:55:50,220
people into their home that
causes them a difficulty. I,

930
00:55:50,230 --> 00:55:53,320
in others it may be some of their
personal proclivities things that they're

931
00:55:53,321 --> 00:55:57,710
looking for online that could
be personally embarrassing,
you know, mistress,

932
00:55:57,750 --> 00:56:00,460
his extramarital affairs,
all of that type of stuff.

933
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:03,850
So those are the general things that
you look at and then you work up a pret,

934
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:08,500
a threat profile. That's something that
I find that most individuals don't do.

935
00:56:08,501 --> 00:56:10,630
And certainly most corporations don't do.

936
00:56:10,631 --> 00:56:14,200
And the fact of the matter is in the
same way that hackers are using the

937
00:56:14,201 --> 00:56:17,530
internet to gather lots of
information about their targets,

938
00:56:17,830 --> 00:56:22,120
you yourself can go out there and use
tools and you talked about reputation.com

939
00:56:22,121 --> 00:56:22,511
and others,

940
00:56:22,511 --> 00:56:25,990
but there are lots tools out there that
will allow people to get really good

941
00:56:25,991 --> 00:56:29,530
open source information on themselves
and the threats against them.

942
00:56:29,830 --> 00:56:33,670
And that's one of the key steps that I
always mentioned to my corporate clients

943
00:56:33,671 --> 00:56:38,080
is that they need to go
ahead and implement an open
source intelligence program.

944
00:56:38,081 --> 00:56:41,350
Because if you are working
on a secret project,

945
00:56:41,351 --> 00:56:44,770
let's say you know it's the latest
iPhone or you're working on the latest

946
00:56:44,771 --> 00:56:47,590
version of Android, something that
you don't want people to know about.

947
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:51,520
If you're got your search engines up
and running and you start seeing people

948
00:56:51,550 --> 00:56:55,870
talking about it or sales lists
are leaking out there or employees,

949
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:59,110
resumes are out there showing that
they're about to jump to the competition.

950
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:02,260
You know, there's just a lot
of stuff that you can detect.

951
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:06,640
And the other point that I tell them
is in most people don't realize this is

952
00:57:06,641 --> 00:57:11,490
make sure that you're looking in the
digital underground. So most people think,

953
00:57:11,491 --> 00:57:12,640
you know,
when they search Google,

954
00:57:12,641 --> 00:57:16,000
they're searching the internet and
when you're searching Google in reality

955
00:57:16,001 --> 00:57:20,910
you're only searching about
0.03% of all the available uh,

956
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:22,840
electronic information
stored on the planet.

957
00:57:23,330 --> 00:57:26,900
So how do you go about searching
the digital underground? Ah,

958
00:57:26,901 --> 00:57:27,940
you have to go onto ground.

959
00:57:30,150 --> 00:57:31,700
The quickest way to do that,

960
00:57:31,701 --> 00:57:35,130
I mean one of the ways that people do
it is by using tor, the onion router.

961
00:57:35,350 --> 00:57:39,480
So that's a specialized piece of software
actually produced by the U s navy.

962
00:57:39,481 --> 00:57:43,680
And it was meant originally to help a
democracy and human rights activists

963
00:57:43,681 --> 00:57:46,430
overseas bypass their national firewalls,

964
00:57:46,470 --> 00:57:50,250
whether in China or Iran so that they
can get around to communicate and it was

965
00:57:50,251 --> 00:57:52,110
very useful for their personal safety.

966
00:57:52,410 --> 00:57:55,800
And there's a million great reasons
why you would use tour. Again,

967
00:57:55,801 --> 00:57:57,540
if you want in the wake of Snowden,

968
00:57:57,541 --> 00:58:01,330
if you wanted to go ahead and have good
encryption of the information you're

969
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:03,420
looking for it,
then a tour is a great,

970
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:06,330
a useful tool for that with
some noted limitations.

971
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:11,340
But the other side of that is that there's
something called Tor hidden services.

972
00:58:11,610 --> 00:58:13,740
And if you're running this
particular piece of software,

973
00:58:13,741 --> 00:58:17,550
you can now get access to a whole
world that you don't know exist.

974
00:58:17,550 --> 00:58:21,930
So this is where hackers and terrorists
and activists and spy agencies and law

975
00:58:21,931 --> 00:58:26,280
enforcement hang out. So I'm sure you
will be familiar with the Silk Road,

976
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:28,800
uh,
and what went on in that case.

977
00:58:28,801 --> 00:58:33,270
It broke very close to you
in San Francisco and the
fact of the matter is dread

978
00:58:33,271 --> 00:58:34,200
pirate Roberts,

979
00:58:34,230 --> 00:58:39,030
the alleged person who was running
that had the largest drug website,

980
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:40,050
uh,
in the world.

981
00:58:40,051 --> 00:58:43,140
And whether or not you like drugs or
not and whatever your position may be,

982
00:58:43,470 --> 00:58:45,750
a National Institute of Health, uh, uh,

983
00:58:45,930 --> 00:58:50,930
drug abuse agency study said at some point
20% of all narcotics purchased in the

984
00:58:51,511 --> 00:58:53,550
United States transmitted the Silk Road.

985
00:58:54,020 --> 00:58:56,030
Wow.
I had no idea the number was so big.

986
00:58:56,250 --> 00:59:01,250
And the money that dread pirate Roberts
brought in in those 30 months was one

987
00:59:01,621 --> 00:59:03,780
point $2 billion.

988
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:08,820
So one point $2 billion and
30 months of methamphetamine,

989
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:13,470
AK 47 uzis child pornography,
fake passports,

990
00:59:13,471 --> 00:59:15,780
whenever you're looking for,
you could buy it there.

991
00:59:15,781 --> 00:59:20,781
And because a silk road operated kind of
like Ebay where the house took a cut of

992
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:21,291
everything,

993
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:26,150
they sold a dread pirate
Roberts is alleged to have
a master personal fortune of

994
00:59:26,151 --> 00:59:29,170
$110 million. So, you know,

995
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:32,450
let's say you're a 28 year
old entrepreneur and kids
don't do this out there,

996
00:59:32,451 --> 00:59:35,540
but if you're a 28 year old
entrepreneur, you know, getting, uh,

997
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:38,720
going from zero to one point
$2 billion in 30 months,

998
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:43,400
he had a relatively successful exit except
for the life imprisonment he's facing.

999
00:59:43,401 --> 00:59:45,050
But other than that, you
know, pretty good Gig,

1000
00:59:46,490 --> 00:59:50,600
right? The, uh, the rather
punishing a asterisk. Yes,

1001
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:54,170
exactly. Oh, no. Income
statement notes. Yeah. Comes,

1002
00:59:54,171 --> 00:59:59,120
comes with free imprisonment for life
and free prison companions. Oh God.

1003
00:59:59,210 --> 01:00:03,440
Uh, the, the, um, see, see,
you mentioned drugs. Uh,

1004
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:08,060
I want to chat about that for a second
because I, I've heard you mention,

1005
01:00:08,061 --> 01:00:12,620
and maybe you can elaborate
on, um, drug production.

1006
01:00:12,621 --> 01:00:15,610
So this is something that I'm
very fascinated by. I mean, uh,

1007
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:17,570
I think drugs is a bit of a,

1008
01:00:19,150 --> 01:00:24,000
so the in the Nancy Reagan say no to
drugs since it's a bit broad, I think, uh,

1009
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:28,850
it's a lot gets mixed into this so called
war on drugs that that shouldn't be

1010
01:00:28,851 --> 01:00:32,330
part of it at all. And a lot
of good therapeutic agents
get disregarded and blah,

1011
01:00:32,331 --> 01:00:36,500
blah blah. But the point being when you
look at just some of the real cash cows,

1012
01:00:36,501 --> 01:00:40,430
if you look at the, the opiates, right?
If you look at the look at heroin,

1013
01:00:40,431 --> 01:00:44,450
you look at cocaine, um, you know,
marijuana is very interesting case.

1014
01:00:44,451 --> 01:00:46,510
We won't get too far into
that. But just the, uh,

1015
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:50,980
the sort of decriminalization of marijuana
is really fascinating, but isn't it,

1016
01:00:50,981 --> 01:00:53,990
it's used mandatory in San Francisco.
It's brilliantly, it's pretty.

1017
01:00:54,010 --> 01:00:57,200
If you're going to Dolores Park,
you by law required to it. Yes,

1018
01:00:57,201 --> 01:00:58,790
we are using marijuana. Yeah. If you skip,

1019
01:00:58,850 --> 01:01:02,960
if you stub your toe and therefore
have chronic pain, then you,

1020
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:07,940
you're permanently disabled. Yes. And
now you need mouth. But I've heard,

1021
01:01:07,941 --> 01:01:12,560
and I can't, I haven't verified
this, but there are a poppy fields,

1022
01:01:12,770 --> 01:01:13,130
uh,

1023
01:01:13,130 --> 01:01:18,130
even within some national parks in
the US that are policed by Mexican,

1024
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:19,610
uh,
narcos.

1025
01:01:19,670 --> 01:01:23,330
And you have to be careful even as a
hiker in some cases if you go too far off

1026
01:01:23,331 --> 01:01:25,010
the beaten path,
uh,

1027
01:01:25,460 --> 01:01:29,510
is that going to change in
so much as we'll drugs? Uh,

1028
01:01:29,570 --> 01:01:34,570
the example that you used was a involving
yeast to synthetically produce cocaine

1029
01:01:37,311 --> 01:01:39,200
are not synthetically perhaps,
but in a,

1030
01:01:39,230 --> 01:01:42,980
I guess it would be synthetically
produced cocaine or other drugs like that.

1031
01:01:42,981 --> 01:01:47,060
Are these, are these fields,
is that entire production
chain and all the shipment?

1032
01:01:47,061 --> 01:01:48,320
Is that just going to go away?

1033
01:01:48,710 --> 01:01:52,880
Yeah, so you've hit on a really, really
interesting point, which is, uh, you know,

1034
01:01:52,881 --> 01:01:57,881
in the same way that apple can go ahead
and disrupt Microsoft and Google can

1035
01:01:58,341 --> 01:02:01,760
disrupt, you know, uh, somebody
else. The fact of the matter is,

1036
01:02:01,761 --> 01:02:02,960
is that the old school,

1037
01:02:02,961 --> 01:02:07,460
original gangsters and narco dealers are
going to be faced with some challenges

1038
01:02:07,461 --> 01:02:12,110
to their business model from and
new generation of joke dealers.

1039
01:02:12,330 --> 01:02:14,960
Uh, and it's going to be really
fascinating. So to your point,

1040
01:02:14,961 --> 01:02:19,961
when you think about what is required for
the production of cocaine today or her

1041
01:02:20,911 --> 01:02:21,301
wind,
right?

1042
01:02:21,301 --> 01:02:25,740
You need these massive fields of cocoa
leaves a marijuana plants or poppy

1043
01:02:26,430 --> 01:02:30,260
plants, et cetera. And that is a
really tough for the dope dealers,

1044
01:02:30,270 --> 01:02:31,410
either expensive to Maine,

1045
01:02:31,650 --> 01:02:35,970
they have a very huge footprint in terms
of hectors and hectors of fields that

1046
01:02:35,971 --> 01:02:40,230
need to be maintained. And they're easy
for law enforcement to detect. So now,

1047
01:02:40,231 --> 01:02:42,150
thanks to synthetic biology,

1048
01:02:42,151 --> 01:02:45,780
one of the amazing things that you can
do is because all of those marijuana

1049
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:46,980
poppy,
uh,

1050
01:02:46,981 --> 01:02:51,981
or coca plants are all naturally
occurring substances that contain DNA.

1051
01:02:53,490 --> 01:02:58,490
You can actually go in and
sequence cocaine plant or
poppy seed or any of those

1052
01:02:58,621 --> 01:03:02,550
things. And from that, deduce
the genetic code for Coco.

1053
01:03:02,790 --> 01:03:06,030
And you can go further in and say,
well, what's the active ingredient here?

1054
01:03:06,031 --> 01:03:10,800
And you can isolate that and you can
snip that part of the plant or the active

1055
01:03:10,801 --> 01:03:14,670
ingredient and you could insert it into
yeast and then you could grow those e's

1056
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:18,630
and you could bake bread with it
and you could make a beer with it.

1057
01:03:18,631 --> 01:03:20,610
So we're not quite there yet,

1058
01:03:20,611 --> 01:03:24,450
but all of these things are on very close
off on the horizon and it completely

1059
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:28,920
breaks our current global security
model around narcotics. Because again,

1060
01:03:28,921 --> 01:03:29,850
we have these,
you know,

1061
01:03:29,851 --> 01:03:33,960
big fields and we look for the big fields
and we have a dope sniffing dogs when

1062
01:03:33,961 --> 01:03:36,600
you arrive at the airport or going
through customs and immigration,

1063
01:03:36,870 --> 01:03:38,550
but they're not going to smell,
you know,

1064
01:03:38,551 --> 01:03:42,240
a loaf of bread that is
just as powerful as cocaine.

1065
01:03:42,510 --> 01:03:46,290
So there's some really interesting
opportunities there moving forward.

1066
01:03:46,291 --> 01:03:49,140
It's going to make for some really
interesting beer and bread in the future.

1067
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:51,310
Is it conceivable?

1068
01:03:51,311 --> 01:03:54,490
This is just now I'm going to really
go off the deep end into my, uh,

1069
01:03:54,940 --> 01:03:57,430
sort of detective novel mode,
but is it,

1070
01:03:57,431 --> 01:04:02,431
is it conceivable that the u s
government could decide that it would be

1071
01:04:03,041 --> 01:04:08,041
pragmatic to in some way seed people
domestically with technology too,

1072
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:15,880
in a very, uh, decentralized
way, produce meaning,

1073
01:04:15,881 --> 01:04:20,500
synthesize cocaine, heroin, et Cetera, uh,

1074
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:24,490
to disrupt the,
uh,

1075
01:04:24,790 --> 01:04:27,910
the incentives and finances of say,

1076
01:04:27,911 --> 01:04:32,150
cartels who are shuttling drugs,
uh, from, and I know the, the,

1077
01:04:32,151 --> 01:04:35,530
the Mexican cartels are
now is as far south as, uh,

1078
01:04:36,010 --> 01:04:39,490
as Columbia where I've spent
some time very, very prevalent,

1079
01:04:39,491 --> 01:04:44,491
but basically in a way to reduce
violence and disrupt that chain.

1080
01:04:45,011 --> 01:04:48,550
Do you think there's any conceivable
scenario in which the government or some

1081
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:53,260
facet of, um, law enforcement
would decide that that type of, uh,

1082
01:04:53,590 --> 01:04:57,250
even the introduction of that type
of production would either be done

1083
01:04:57,251 --> 01:04:59,320
deliberately or a,
uh,

1084
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:03,960
or have a blind eye has to it to,
um,

1085
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:05,590
for the tradeoff,

1086
01:05:05,620 --> 01:05:10,620
which is disrupting the immensely
violence and problematic influence of the

1087
01:05:11,891 --> 01:05:12,790
cartels in Mexico?

1088
01:05:13,420 --> 01:05:13,721
Yeah,
I mean,

1089
01:05:13,721 --> 01:05:18,721
you're asking for a particularly
interesting public and political question.

1090
01:05:19,060 --> 01:05:20,920
There are plenty of folks
who are advocating for this.

1091
01:05:20,921 --> 01:05:24,970
There's a great talk by a gentleman called
Ethan Nadelmann who I just saw speak

1092
01:05:24,971 --> 01:05:26,740
down at Ted Global,
uh,

1093
01:05:26,741 --> 01:05:30,910
who really gives a very powerful and
compelling talk for why drugs should be

1094
01:05:30,911 --> 01:05:34,720
legalized. And you know, you can Google
that and find his talk. Um, there are,

1095
01:05:34,721 --> 01:05:34,961
you know,

1096
01:05:34,961 --> 01:05:38,170
we're kind of seeing the beginnings of
that now with marijuana and there are

1097
01:05:38,171 --> 01:05:40,890
other countries like the
Netherlands than have, you know,

1098
01:05:40,930 --> 01:05:44,320
allowed people to be on heroin for
years and put them on Methadone.

1099
01:05:44,321 --> 01:05:47,560
So there've been lots of different
experiments around this. I would say.

1100
01:05:47,561 --> 01:05:51,460
I don't know that the public policy and
more importantly the politics around

1101
01:05:51,461 --> 01:05:53,000
this is there yet. But, uh,

1102
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:58,020
you can certainly look at the cost of
what it is doing to our society. Uh,

1103
01:05:58,300 --> 01:05:59,590
particularly here in the United States.

1104
01:05:59,591 --> 01:06:02,770
We have the largest incarcerated
population in the world.

1105
01:06:02,771 --> 01:06:06,240
I think there are something
like 3 million people, uh,

1106
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:10,840
that are somehow in the criminal justice
system at state pen or at the local

1107
01:06:10,841 --> 01:06:14,880
level, uh, in federal penitentiary.
So the cost of maintaining that,

1108
01:06:14,881 --> 01:06:17,920
and most of those folks are there
for drugs one way or the other.

1109
01:06:17,921 --> 01:06:21,730
So there's certainly an economic
cause to be put forth. And again,

1110
01:06:21,731 --> 01:06:25,090
I'd refer you to Ethan Nadelmann,
who makes that way better than I can.

1111
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:27,190
I don't know that the government,
uh,

1112
01:06:27,191 --> 01:06:32,191
anytime soon is going to see this more
as a public health issue and focus on

1113
01:06:32,681 --> 01:06:34,720
demand reduction right now,
public policy,

1114
01:06:34,750 --> 01:06:39,100
the United States has been almost a
heavily geared towards a supply reduction.

1115
01:06:39,101 --> 01:06:41,020
So, you know, let's go
ahead and, you know,

1116
01:06:41,021 --> 01:06:45,760
drop napalm on cocaine fields and Columbia
and that'll solve it. And of course,

1117
01:06:45,761 --> 01:06:48,070
the, as the, the people in Latin America,

1118
01:06:48,071 --> 01:06:51,460
the Mexican president and others have
mentioned, uh, well, don't blame us.

1119
01:06:51,461 --> 01:06:55,940
You guys are the ones that want to buy
it. So it's really complex, right? Um,

1120
01:06:55,960 --> 01:07:00,830
how this works. I will mention that the
narcos are all over the drug trade, uh,

1121
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:05,290
from all over the technology, uh,
space, uh, in really amazing ways.

1122
01:07:05,291 --> 01:07:09,880
So Narchos are using robots, they are
flying drones, they've got drug subs.

1123
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:10,420
Um,

1124
01:07:10,420 --> 01:07:15,420
there are now a quad copter drones in
octocopter drones that can carry like

1125
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,920
thousand kilo,
uh,

1126
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:22,120
loads of cocaine and marijuana
across the Mexican American border.

1127
01:07:22,420 --> 01:07:27,010
We're starting to see that there are
2000 tons carried by remote controlled a

1128
01:07:27,020 --> 01:07:28,390
narco subs.
The,

1129
01:07:28,391 --> 01:07:32,200
some of the Colombian cartels
literally have a r and d budget.

1130
01:07:32,201 --> 01:07:37,201
So the cocaine cartels in Colombia had
like $5 million allocated to r and D for

1131
01:07:38,321 --> 01:07:42,340
robotics because the day that they can
launch autonomous subs up against North

1132
01:07:42,341 --> 01:07:43,690
America,
they've hit pay dirt.

1133
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:47,350
So we're seeing that and the
money and the sums are involved.

1134
01:07:47,370 --> 01:07:51,040
We were talking earlier about how
clever a terrorist may or may not be.

1135
01:07:51,070 --> 01:07:54,910
You should look at the sophistication
among the narcos and the money that they

1136
01:07:54,911 --> 01:07:59,890
have allows them to bring in
tremendous talent. Uh, El Chapo,

1137
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:04,840
Joaquin Guzman who ran the scene on Lola
cartel was recently arrested in Mexico.

1138
01:08:04,841 --> 01:08:06,430
And at the time of his arrest,

1139
01:08:06,730 --> 01:08:09,880
he had a room in his mansion,

1140
01:08:09,910 --> 01:08:14,910
a cash room with $200 million
in cash just sitting his house.

1141
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:19,220
We call that the Tim Ferriss Room,
obviously for obvious reasons,

1142
01:08:19,230 --> 01:08:24,230
but he was actually listed at number one
on the Forbes wealthiest list ahead of

1143
01:08:25,221 --> 01:08:29,630
Oprah and French President Sarcozi.
Right. So the amount of money, by the way,

1144
01:08:29,631 --> 01:08:34,040
to put $200 million in perspective,
Interpol's annual budget is $90 million.

1145
01:08:34,420 --> 01:08:35,253
Wow.

1146
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:40,120
So you were a sports team that you
would bet on that sports team against

1147
01:08:40,510 --> 01:08:41,590
Interpol in a heartbeat.

1148
01:08:41,940 --> 01:08:43,820
And it would seem to be the wiser bit.

1149
01:08:43,890 --> 01:08:46,380
Yes. In terms of talent
recruitment, he should have,

1150
01:08:46,770 --> 01:08:49,470
he should have a number
of incentives to use.

1151
01:08:49,471 --> 01:08:54,420
I will kill you or you work for me or
exactly how we'll give you twice as much

1152
01:08:54,421 --> 01:08:58,140
as anyone else, any other law enforcement
agency or at least Interpol can pay it.

1153
01:08:58,570 --> 01:09:01,310
And by the way, that's exactly
happening right now. There's, you know,

1154
01:09:01,430 --> 01:09:04,490
we were kind of joking about what's
going on with the narco wars in Mexico,

1155
01:09:04,491 --> 01:09:08,420
but there have been 50,000
innocent medic Mexican citizens,

1156
01:09:08,421 --> 01:09:11,300
nationals that have been
slayed in the past six years.

1157
01:09:11,450 --> 01:09:14,930
So just south of our border,
50,000 people, right? You know,

1158
01:09:15,010 --> 01:09:18,980
more than live in Palo Alto
or the suburb of New York, uh,

1159
01:09:18,990 --> 01:09:20,060
had been murdered.

1160
01:09:20,090 --> 01:09:23,900
And so there's a massive war going on
between the people we talked about crowd

1161
01:09:23,901 --> 01:09:26,840
sourcing before.
There's a ton of incredibly brave.

1162
01:09:26,870 --> 01:09:31,870
I'm Mexican citizens who actually crowd
sourcing the location and activities of

1163
01:09:32,030 --> 01:09:34,190
the narcos and, uh, they're,

1164
01:09:34,191 --> 01:09:37,700
they're using open source tools like
Google maps to report dope dealers and

1165
01:09:37,701 --> 01:09:38,960
bring that information forward.

1166
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:43,490
The dope dealers have gotten hip to
that and if now actually gone ahead and

1167
01:09:43,491 --> 01:09:47,960
killed off a bunch of these
citizen reporters and so, uh,

1168
01:09:47,961 --> 01:09:48,860
to protect themselves.

1169
01:09:48,860 --> 01:09:52,820
Now those guys are using encryption
and then narcos have gone out there and

1170
01:09:52,821 --> 01:09:55,400
actually kidnapped hackers.
They've kidnapped,

1171
01:09:55,460 --> 01:09:59,000
like top hackers off the
street and brought them back
to their headquarters and

1172
01:09:59,001 --> 01:10:01,760
say, hey, you decrypt this
or I'm gonna kill you. Uh,

1173
01:10:01,761 --> 01:10:05,820
and the payback once somebody
is identified as being
a potential snitch, uh,

1174
01:10:05,821 --> 01:10:08,510
for the narcos have been
draconian. I, you know,

1175
01:10:08,511 --> 01:10:11,030
it's kind of gross and you can
edit this out if you need be,

1176
01:10:11,031 --> 01:10:12,260
but to make their points,

1177
01:10:12,530 --> 01:10:16,820
some of the Narchos have gone ahead and
kidnap some of these folks were using

1178
01:10:16,821 --> 01:10:18,780
tools like Google maps too,

1179
01:10:18,810 --> 01:10:22,100
to crowdsource what was going on with
the drug dealers in their activities,

1180
01:10:22,970 --> 01:10:24,450
kidnap them,
uh,

1181
01:10:24,530 --> 01:10:28,690
and killed them and decapitating
them and taking their heads, uh,

1182
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:32,000
and brought them to the central square
of the town like right in front of the

1183
01:10:32,001 --> 01:10:35,830
church when everybody shows up on
Sunday morning and they took two, uh,

1184
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:36,980
computer keyboards,

1185
01:10:36,981 --> 01:10:41,150
put them in the town square in front of
the church that everybody shows up at

1186
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:42,110
with the head.

1187
01:10:42,110 --> 01:10:46,250
The human head of this niche right there
and with a note in big letters is that

1188
01:10:46,251 --> 01:10:47,630
this is what happens to rats.

1189
01:10:48,530 --> 01:10:51,720
I horrifying of course.
And the,

1190
01:10:51,721 --> 01:10:55,950
the number that I have so much
trouble grasping is 50,000.

1191
01:10:55,951 --> 01:10:59,620
It's so many people, uh, are, what,

1192
01:10:59,910 --> 01:11:00,990
how does that break down?

1193
01:11:00,991 --> 01:11:04,330
If you're looking at the pie chart
of reasons for these deaths, um,

1194
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:09,440
how many of them are snitches or what
percentage versus a stray bullets and just

1195
01:11:11,790 --> 01:11:14,570
collateral damage,
shotgun,

1196
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:19,580
all campaigns to instill fear and terror
into entire cities and to compliance.

1197
01:11:19,951 --> 01:11:24,810
Because I, I've, I've read these stories
of say 20 or 50 students being killed,

1198
01:11:25,010 --> 01:11:28,220
right? We had that right now in the past
couple of weeks we've had all these,

1199
01:11:28,221 --> 01:11:28,461
you know,

1200
01:11:28,461 --> 01:11:32,930
innocent high school students who were
just murdered allegedly by the mayor and

1201
01:11:32,931 --> 01:11:35,810
the police in the town. So, you
know, I could make up a story,

1202
01:11:35,811 --> 01:11:38,330
but I don't know the exact
breakdown of what it is.

1203
01:11:38,331 --> 01:11:41,960
My Gut tells me based upon what I've read
in research that brought in, you know,

1204
01:11:41,961 --> 01:11:45,590
there's some percentage of this that
his drug dealer on drug dealer violence.

1205
01:11:45,591 --> 01:11:47,900
So one cartel fighting with another,

1206
01:11:48,170 --> 01:11:52,730
the others are people that won't go along
with the narcos and what they are up

1207
01:11:53,210 --> 01:11:55,910
against and what they want to do.
So they get taken out,

1208
01:11:55,911 --> 01:11:57,860
law enforcement officers get taken out.

1209
01:11:58,100 --> 01:12:02,540
And then there's just a tremendous
number of casualties when you know,

1210
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:06,140
the trucks come through the little town
and everybody's shooting eight ks and

1211
01:12:06,150 --> 01:12:09,800
[inaudible] and then you know,
five year olds get gunned down, uh,

1212
01:12:09,870 --> 01:12:11,390
is kind of collateral damage,

1213
01:12:13,490 --> 01:12:14,780
man.
Good to count,

1214
01:12:15,050 --> 01:12:18,050
count our blessings when you don't
have to contend with that on a,

1215
01:12:18,290 --> 01:12:22,940
on a regular basis or an anytime
basis. It's really horrifying, uh,

1216
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:23,781
to,

1217
01:12:23,781 --> 01:12:27,770
to just maybe project forward a bit and
I'm not sure if it's projecting forward

1218
01:12:27,771 --> 01:12:31,890
that far in fact, but
artificial intelligence, uh,

1219
01:12:32,690 --> 01:12:36,110
there are a lot of different
differing opinions on this,

1220
01:12:36,111 --> 01:12:38,570
but what are the threats,
if any,

1221
01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:42,980
of artificial intelligence and where are
things now versus where you think they

1222
01:12:42,981 --> 01:12:43,814
might be?

1223
01:12:44,190 --> 01:12:47,640
That is a great question. You know, it's
actually very much in the news today.

1224
01:12:47,670 --> 01:12:52,670
Elon Musk and I quote him in my book
talks about the threat from AI being

1225
01:12:52,741 --> 01:12:55,290
greater than nukes.
And uh,

1226
01:12:55,291 --> 01:12:59,940
Stephen Hawking actually put an op Ed in
the independent in London about a month

1227
01:12:59,941 --> 01:13:04,941
or two ago where he was very cautious
about a widespread adoption of Ai.

1228
01:13:04,951 --> 01:13:09,000
Just for folks who aren't particularly
familiar with Ai. Um, you know,

1229
01:13:09,001 --> 01:13:10,110
there are generally two types.

1230
01:13:10,111 --> 01:13:14,610
There's the narrow AI that's
the artificial intelligence
that goes ahead and

1231
01:13:14,611 --> 01:13:19,611
puts a recommendation for you out there
on Netflix or Amazon about what book you

1232
01:13:19,681 --> 01:13:22,440
might like. If you enjoyed this
movie, you might like this movie.

1233
01:13:22,650 --> 01:13:26,940
So that kind of narrow AI is widespread
and ubiquitous. It's, you know,

1234
01:13:26,941 --> 01:13:30,720
AI that allows you to talk to American
Airlines while you're on hold.

1235
01:13:30,721 --> 01:13:32,160
And we're seeing that every place.

1236
01:13:32,430 --> 01:13:35,520
And then there's the broader
and more widespread AI,

1237
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:40,760
which is kind of a artificial general
intelligence that's kind of the skynet AI

1238
01:13:40,801 --> 01:13:45,180
that people fear. We'll run the planet.
And there were some concerns about both,

1239
01:13:45,450 --> 01:13:47,940
broadly speaking, you know, we all saw,

1240
01:13:47,941 --> 01:13:52,890
or most of us may have seen the television
episode for a jeopardy when Ibm's

1241
01:13:52,891 --> 01:13:56,100
Watson was playing. Did you happen to
catch that? I didn't personally see it.

1242
01:13:56,340 --> 01:13:57,390
So it's,
you know,

1243
01:13:57,391 --> 01:14:02,190
IBM built this computer called Watson
and it's doing a narrow AI in a plate

1244
01:14:02,191 --> 01:14:06,450
against the top, top jeopardy champs
and just kick their butts. Right?

1245
01:14:06,630 --> 01:14:11,470
So this big computer with a funny voice
called Watson was able to be the best

1246
01:14:11,471 --> 01:14:14,350
champions in the world. Uh,
jeopardy. And before that, you know,

1247
01:14:14,351 --> 01:14:17,350
we had our greatest chess
champions being beaten by computer.

1248
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:21,820
But the question that people don't realize
or don't often ask themselves is what

1249
01:14:21,821 --> 01:14:26,380
would happen if Watson turned
to a life of crime, right?

1250
01:14:26,410 --> 01:14:28,870
How much health care
fraud could Watson commit,

1251
01:14:28,871 --> 01:14:31,770
how much identity theft
could wants and commit?

1252
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:34,210
The fact of the matter is
is that day in and day out,

1253
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:37,750
we're turning over more and
more of our lives to algorithms.

1254
01:14:38,710 --> 01:14:42,250
People worry about individual
bits of data being stolen,

1255
01:14:42,251 --> 01:14:45,280
but that's like kind of a low level
threat. Of course that's happening.

1256
01:14:45,580 --> 01:14:50,230
The bigger threat is having our algorithm
hacks algorithms are very complex

1257
01:14:50,530 --> 01:14:55,360
mathematical formula that go out there
and carry out everything from the anti

1258
01:14:55,361 --> 01:15:00,340
brake system in your car to the GPS and
navigation used by aircraft around the

1259
01:15:00,341 --> 01:15:04,840
world to a all the trading on the stock
floors. And those are all algorithms.

1260
01:15:04,841 --> 01:15:09,400
And we've seen a couple of really crazy
wacky things going on in the world of

1261
01:15:09,430 --> 01:15:13,120
algorithms to such, you know, which
look like market manipulation.

1262
01:15:13,540 --> 01:15:17,680
The challenges is that Moore's
law applies to criminals as well.

1263
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:22,540
And the big paradigm shift in crime
has been as a result of algorithmic

1264
01:15:22,541 --> 01:15:23,140
programming.

1265
01:15:23,140 --> 01:15:27,520
So in the book I talk about the fact that
the old paradigm of crime is you get a

1266
01:15:27,521 --> 01:15:28,121
bad guy,

1267
01:15:28,121 --> 01:15:32,080
he goes out and buys a knife or gun hides
in a dark alley and says stick 'em up.

1268
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:36,160
Right? That was a good, that was a good
business. You could be your own boss,

1269
01:15:36,161 --> 01:15:38,980
set your own hours. Startup
costs were low, but Tim,

1270
01:15:38,981 --> 01:15:42,670
you know this better than anybody else.
What was his problem? It didn't scale.

1271
01:15:42,850 --> 01:15:47,810
How do you scale your business? Right?
That was tough for a criminal. Exactly.

1272
01:15:47,811 --> 01:15:51,880
And, and everybody, you rob might shoot
back and kill you. Right? Um, so, uh,

1273
01:15:51,881 --> 01:15:55,570
technology came along that actually
improved upon that business model and the

1274
01:15:55,571 --> 01:16:00,280
technology was the locomotive. Now,
rather than robbing one person at a time,

1275
01:16:00,281 --> 01:16:04,260
we could rob 200 people at a time.
Now when they created trains,

1276
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:07,420
nobody thought about that.
But of course that was a consequence.

1277
01:16:07,780 --> 01:16:11,860
Fast forward today to the days of the
Internet and we've had hacks like at

1278
01:16:11,861 --> 01:16:16,861
target and the Sony playstation hack
before that were 100 million people were

1279
01:16:18,671 --> 01:16:22,750
simultaneously, uh, victims
of a crime in the target hack.

1280
01:16:22,751 --> 01:16:26,320
One third of all Americans
were effected by that.

1281
01:16:26,530 --> 01:16:28,690
So if you talk about exponentials,

1282
01:16:28,691 --> 01:16:33,691
we've gone from criminals robbing one
person to one single lone individual being

1283
01:16:34,901 --> 01:16:38,140
able to rob 100 million people.

1284
01:16:38,350 --> 01:16:42,250
That is a complete paradigm shift in
crime. And because it's exponential,

1285
01:16:42,460 --> 01:16:44,140
it's only going to grow.

1286
01:16:44,141 --> 01:16:47,470
And so my big fear and concern that
I write about in future crimes,

1287
01:16:47,471 --> 01:16:52,471
the book is the fact that our systems
of justice and law and order and public

1288
01:16:53,621 --> 01:16:55,750
safety are all deeply,
deeply linear.

1289
01:16:56,020 --> 01:16:59,050
And yet the threat is
entirely exponential.

1290
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:01,390
And we're seeing criminals use algorithms,
right?

1291
01:17:01,420 --> 01:17:06,130
You know why you can rob 100 million
people because computer crime has been

1292
01:17:06,131 --> 01:17:10,610
reduced to an algorithm. The old days, I
talked about the movie war games earlier.

1293
01:17:10,611 --> 01:17:12,710
The old day was you'd have the,
you know,

1294
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:15,350
high school kid with the
bag of Doritos and you know,

1295
01:17:15,351 --> 01:17:18,890
monster or red bull sitting is
computer hacking away at all hours.

1296
01:17:19,190 --> 01:17:23,210
You don't need to do that any more. You
can write scripts that carry out crime.

1297
01:17:23,510 --> 01:17:27,650
You've heard of software as a service.
Guess what? There's crime as a service.

1298
01:17:27,651 --> 01:17:31,760
You can actually go out there and buy
programs like black shades and others that

1299
01:17:31,761 --> 01:17:33,980
will go out there and
commit crime for you.

1300
01:17:33,981 --> 01:17:37,850
And so when a computer program
can do the identity theft,

1301
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:41,300
can do the denial of service
attacks can do that for you.

1302
01:17:41,330 --> 01:17:45,310
It can run in the background
24, seven, you know, uh,

1303
01:17:45,380 --> 01:17:47,690
365 days a year to carry out that crime.

1304
01:17:47,930 --> 01:17:51,770
That's why it's skills and that's why
the profits are so high. And you know,

1305
01:17:51,771 --> 01:17:56,030
a lot of the principles in the four
hour workweek have been implemented by

1306
01:17:56,031 --> 01:17:57,920
organized crime.
I'm not saying they read your book,

1307
01:17:58,010 --> 01:18:02,960
but I'm saying that the logic that
you developed in a lot of this, uh,

1308
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:04,310
you know,
people are seeing that.

1309
01:18:04,311 --> 01:18:08,180
And so now we have fully automated crime
and its algorithms that are carrying it

1310
01:18:08,181 --> 01:18:09,110
out.
And Ai.

1311
01:18:09,940 --> 01:18:11,350
Yeah, it's a, I mean, these,

1312
01:18:11,351 --> 01:18:15,130
these principles and whenever you look
at principles for effectiveness and

1313
01:18:15,131 --> 01:18:19,660
efficiency or scaling or building
an organization, they can,

1314
01:18:20,260 --> 01:18:24,520
they can of course cut both ways.
I mean, they can be used as a,

1315
01:18:24,521 --> 01:18:29,500
as a surgical tool to do good things they
can use. B is to decapitate people, the,

1316
01:18:29,501 --> 01:18:33,500
you know, metaphorically or
physically, uh, even. But, um,

1317
01:18:33,950 --> 01:18:36,980
and that's an important point I'd love
to make is, I'm not saying by the way,

1318
01:18:36,981 --> 01:18:40,160
technology is bad. You know, I
like you live in Silicon Valley,

1319
01:18:40,430 --> 01:18:42,200
I'm a huge proponent of technology.

1320
01:18:42,201 --> 01:18:46,880
It has the opportunity to bring tremendous
abundance and positive good to the

1321
01:18:46,881 --> 01:18:48,380
world.
But as you mentioned,

1322
01:18:48,381 --> 01:18:53,381
whether it be a knife can be used by a
surgeon to heal or by a criminal to kill.

1323
01:18:53,751 --> 01:18:55,490
And it's just about how we use it.

1324
01:18:56,700 --> 01:19:01,150
No, absolutely. And I'd
love to, to chat. Uh,

1325
01:19:01,590 --> 01:19:03,630
I know we're probably going
to be wrapping up pretty soon,

1326
01:19:03,631 --> 01:19:07,350
but I wanted to ask you
just about what can be done.

1327
01:19:07,540 --> 01:19:12,020
So let's assume that the people
listening are, are for the most part,

1328
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:13,050
not going to,
uh,

1329
01:19:13,380 --> 01:19:16,470
they're not going to feel compelled to
dig a spider hole and their backyard

1330
01:19:16,770 --> 01:19:19,380
because they're afraid the black
helicopters are going to come for them.

1331
01:19:19,381 --> 01:19:19,651
And you know,

1332
01:19:19,651 --> 01:19:22,910
they're going to fight off the u s
government with their stash of canyons.

1333
01:19:23,190 --> 01:19:27,450
Let's just assume that that's not
who we're talking to primarily.

1334
01:19:27,630 --> 01:19:29,700
But for people who were
like, all right, I'm busy,

1335
01:19:30,450 --> 01:19:32,370
I've got a little bit of
money and well educated.

1336
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:36,900
I'm very worried about doing stupid
things that compromise me. Uh, you know,

1337
01:19:36,901 --> 01:19:37,321
what are,

1338
01:19:37,321 --> 01:19:42,321
what are a handful of simple steps that
they should take a or might consider

1339
01:19:43,711 --> 01:19:47,160
taking to decrease the odds
of bad things happening?

1340
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:52,570
Uh, well I can throw out some tips for
individuals and then some for startups and

1341
01:19:52,571 --> 01:19:55,570
companies. So, uh, on the
individual front, you know,

1342
01:19:55,571 --> 01:19:57,670
common sense actually is not so common.

1343
01:19:57,970 --> 01:20:01,570
And the number of people that will click
on links and open attachments is really

1344
01:20:01,571 --> 01:20:05,260
high as a really strong piece of advice.
Just don't do that.

1345
01:20:05,261 --> 01:20:07,150
It's really bad cyber hygiene.

1346
01:20:07,410 --> 01:20:10,950
And I talk about the concept of cyber
hygiene and the idea of keeping yourself

1347
01:20:10,951 --> 01:20:14,550
clean. And if you think about, you know,
sexually transmitted diseases, right?

1348
01:20:14,551 --> 01:20:16,560
If you're not cleaning your
transmitted to other people,

1349
01:20:16,770 --> 01:20:19,560
the same is true with our
computers. So don't do the hat. Uh,

1350
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:23,610
another thing that you can do is make
sure that your computer or your mobile

1351
01:20:23,611 --> 01:20:25,860
phone is constantly up to date.

1352
01:20:26,070 --> 01:20:28,740
Have you ever been sitting in front
of your computer when you get a little

1353
01:20:28,741 --> 01:20:30,210
notification like,
hey,

1354
01:20:30,211 --> 01:20:34,350
there's a new update to windows or there's
a new update to Ios or something like

1355
01:20:34,351 --> 01:20:36,780
that. Have you come across those? Sure.
Yeah, I get notifications all the time,

1356
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:39,260
right? So what people don't,
what that isn't saying,

1357
01:20:39,270 --> 01:20:41,940
it sounds really nice when they
say, oh, there's an update.

1358
01:20:42,060 --> 01:20:44,450
What it really means is our secure,

1359
01:20:44,490 --> 01:20:48,570
our software has been riddled with
security holes for the past six months,

1360
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:51,360
you know, since the previous update.
And we're now finally fixing them.

1361
01:20:51,630 --> 01:20:53,970
So you know,
there's the flip side of that.

1362
01:20:53,971 --> 01:20:58,890
I would say always make sure that your
software is up to date across all of your

1363
01:20:58,891 --> 01:21:03,270
devices and UNC keep that updated.
Another thing you can do, a,

1364
01:21:03,271 --> 01:21:07,980
I am not a fan of single sign on and
using the same password to log on to,

1365
01:21:08,190 --> 01:21:09,600
you know,
all your services.

1366
01:21:09,870 --> 01:21:13,740
The challenge with that is if your
account at target gets hacked and you use

1367
01:21:13,741 --> 01:21:18,330
your same target email and
login a across multiple sites.

1368
01:21:18,330 --> 01:21:20,970
Now the bad guys,
and they do routinely do this once,

1369
01:21:20,971 --> 01:21:24,720
they get 100 million accounts from target,
they're taking your target, you know,

1370
01:21:24,721 --> 01:21:28,650
name and password and they're trying
it at Bank of America and Citi Bank and

1371
01:21:28,651 --> 01:21:30,330
they're trying to get
a Facebook and Google.

1372
01:21:30,331 --> 01:21:34,200
So if you ha you should definitely have
a different name and password for all of

1373
01:21:34,201 --> 01:21:37,980
your sites. And I know people say to me
a great mark, how am I going to remember,

1374
01:21:37,981 --> 01:21:38,221
you know,

1375
01:21:38,221 --> 01:21:42,510
300 passwords and this one wants a
capital letter and the other one wants the

1376
01:21:42,511 --> 01:21:46,710
name of my favorite a child actress.
And it's all too complex.

1377
01:21:47,010 --> 01:21:50,130
There are a number of pieces of
software out there called a password.

1378
01:21:50,131 --> 01:21:55,131
Managers are password wallets that I
recommend you have to use some caution

1379
01:21:55,141 --> 01:21:58,440
because guess what? Organized crime have
created their own versions of those.

1380
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:00,210
So they call,
they'll upload something.

1381
01:22:00,210 --> 01:22:04,800
It's like super number one best password
program and get it into the android

1382
01:22:04,801 --> 01:22:07,470
play star and tens of thousands
of people download it.

1383
01:22:07,471 --> 01:22:10,890
And of course your passwords are just
being fed to organized crime in the

1384
01:22:10,891 --> 01:22:14,310
background. So I recommend
a one password. Uh,

1385
01:22:14,460 --> 01:22:16,890
there's another one called last pass,
which is quite good.

1386
01:22:16,891 --> 01:22:21,480
And then there's key pass, k, e p a,
s, s which is an open source version.

1387
01:22:21,481 --> 01:22:25,740
So definitely do not use the same
password if you're in a public space.

1388
01:22:25,770 --> 01:22:29,400
Always make sure that you use a Vpn,
a virtual private network.

1389
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:33,630
This way any of the information that
is transiting from your computer to the

1390
01:22:33,631 --> 01:22:36,780
Internet is encrypted from
that point to point a.

1391
01:22:36,781 --> 01:22:39,300
If you're not and you're
sitting at a local Starbucks,

1392
01:22:39,540 --> 01:22:42,540
I can go ahead and just because
we're on the same network,

1393
01:22:42,541 --> 01:22:44,310
see everything you're
doing on your computer.

1394
01:22:44,610 --> 01:22:48,750
There was a hack of years ago called
fire sheep where I could steal your

1395
01:22:48,751 --> 01:22:52,560
Facebook session cookie and log in is
you and post things to your Facebook

1396
01:22:52,561 --> 01:22:55,980
account. Just because we were on the
same network and you didn't need to be

1397
01:22:55,981 --> 01:22:56,701
sophisticated.

1398
01:22:56,701 --> 01:23:01,701
Actually it was just a browsing for a
Firefox browser that allowed me to hack.

1399
01:23:01,711 --> 01:23:05,860
So the tools of hacking are
becoming particularly, um, you know,

1400
01:23:05,861 --> 01:23:09,940
easy to use. Um, so if you do those
things, if you maintain your site,

1401
01:23:10,710 --> 01:23:13,780
if you go ahead and constantly updating
them and use password managers,

1402
01:23:13,990 --> 01:23:18,880
you can actually avoid 85% of the threats
out there. So you can make a massive,

1403
01:23:18,940 --> 01:23:20,200
massive difference.

1404
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:25,560
The last one that I tell people that most
folks don't consider is do not use the

1405
01:23:25,811 --> 01:23:29,950
admin account from your own
computer as your primary account.

1406
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:33,490
So if you have, you
know, on your computer,

1407
01:23:33,930 --> 01:23:37,960
a Tim Ferriss account, that account
should not have administrative privileges.

1408
01:23:37,961 --> 01:23:39,550
You should have a primary account,

1409
01:23:39,820 --> 01:23:44,260
which is administrative privileges and
the one that you use day in and day out

1410
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:48,220
should be a user account with degraded
non administrative privileges.

1411
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:49,150
Why would you do that?

1412
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:55,080
Because if you click on the email from
the Nigerian prince by accident and get

1413
01:23:56,201 --> 01:24:00,310
your computer infected, if you're
already logged in under admin account,

1414
01:24:00,340 --> 01:24:04,690
then that code needs no
further permissions to go
ahead and infect you and to

1415
01:24:04,691 --> 01:24:05,860
get onto your machine.

1416
01:24:06,100 --> 01:24:10,870
But if you're on a user account and you
get that infection in order to change

1417
01:24:10,871 --> 01:24:14,020
the system files,
it will ask you to enter in your password,

1418
01:24:14,021 --> 01:24:15,640
which should be a good clue
that you've been hacked.

1419
01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:19,590
Got It. Okay, so you're talking
about for the the computer access,

1420
01:24:19,591 --> 01:24:20,850
the local computer access,

1421
01:24:21,090 --> 01:24:24,060
correct. Yeah. If you're logged
onto your personal, you know,

1422
01:24:24,061 --> 01:24:28,050
your Mac book air or a windows machine
or a Samsung machine, whatever it is,

1423
01:24:28,051 --> 01:24:29,580
your laptop,
your home computer,

1424
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:32,880
it's really wise to never
run it as an administrator.

1425
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:37,060
God, it's okay. No, that makes
sense. And just to add to your,

1426
01:24:37,061 --> 01:24:40,420
your password recommendation, which
I think is a smart one, you know,

1427
01:24:40,421 --> 01:24:44,040
whether it's one password,
lastpass or otherwise, is uh,

1428
01:24:44,140 --> 01:24:46,690
enabling two step authentication.
Uh,

1429
01:24:46,780 --> 01:24:51,490
excellent is really a good
idea for, you know, for Gmail,

1430
01:24:51,491 --> 01:24:55,700
for Facebook, for any
account that you can to, uh,

1431
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:58,540
enable two step authentication for those
people listening who don't know what

1432
01:24:58,541 --> 01:25:03,400
that is, it's usually within
setting somewhere. And all
that means is if you try,

1433
01:25:03,401 --> 01:25:07,180
if you or someone else tries to log
in to say your Gmail account from an

1434
01:25:07,181 --> 01:25:08,470
unrecognized computer,

1435
01:25:08,740 --> 01:25:13,740
it's going to shoot you a typically a
very often a text to your cell phone with

1436
01:25:15,370 --> 01:25:20,140
a pass key that you need to enter in
order to then enter your password.

1437
01:25:20,550 --> 01:25:25,180
So it's just another barrier, so to
speak. It's a great piece of advice. Uh,

1438
01:25:25,210 --> 01:25:26,590
what about,
so with the startups,

1439
01:25:26,591 --> 01:25:30,220
are there any other pieces of advice that
you would have a low hanging fruit for

1440
01:25:30,221 --> 01:25:31,040
those folks?

1441
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:33,810
Well. So for the folks that are
working in the startup, we're holding,

1442
01:25:33,811 --> 01:25:36,740
I advise a lot of different startups
as I know that you do. You know,

1443
01:25:36,741 --> 01:25:40,010
they're running around crazy
trying to get their beta out there.

1444
01:25:40,011 --> 01:25:42,650
They want to get this ship, their
code, whatever their product is.

1445
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:46,610
And so probably the very last
thing on their list is security.

1446
01:25:46,611 --> 01:25:48,170
They don't think about it and so forth.

1447
01:25:48,470 --> 01:25:50,990
A company you need to think
about these issues, right?

1448
01:25:50,991 --> 01:25:53,210
Because all you have is
your intellectual property.

1449
01:25:53,211 --> 01:25:56,090
And there are actually companies
out there that specialize, you know,

1450
01:25:56,091 --> 01:25:57,350
the minute Facebook has launched,

1451
01:25:57,351 --> 01:26:00,530
they create the German version of Facebook
and they create the Chinese version

1452
01:26:00,531 --> 01:26:05,240
of Ebay. And so ripping off your
IP very much what they do. So, uh,

1453
01:26:05,270 --> 01:26:08,180
both for startups and particularly
for larger corporations,

1454
01:26:08,750 --> 01:26:12,680
one thing I often suggest is that you
need to be keenly aware of what's going on

1455
01:26:12,681 --> 01:26:15,260
with your competition and
with your own company.

1456
01:26:15,470 --> 01:26:20,180
So that goes back to implementing an
open source intelligence program. Uh,

1457
01:26:20,450 --> 01:26:23,750
you also need to have somebody who is
in charge of your security and kind of

1458
01:26:23,751 --> 01:26:24,531
thinks, you know, you know,

1459
01:26:24,531 --> 01:26:28,640
with the more of a conspiratorial
mindset that you and I seem to have a in

1460
01:26:28,641 --> 01:26:31,040
talking about this stuff and
figuring out what can go wrong.

1461
01:26:31,041 --> 01:26:34,400
Because most people are good people.
They don't think like bad guys. Right?

1462
01:26:34,401 --> 01:26:36,950
And I put handcuffs on bad guys
for 20 years all over the world.

1463
01:26:36,951 --> 01:26:41,150
I know how they think. So if you're not
trained in that, it's not at all obvious.

1464
01:26:41,470 --> 01:26:41,840
Um,

1465
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:46,840
it's also important to realize that not
everything needs to go into a computer.

1466
01:26:47,420 --> 01:26:50,420
Both Coca Cola and Kentucky Fried Chicken,
KFC,

1467
01:26:50,630 --> 01:26:55,630
the secret recipes for their food is
not in any electronic system and be

1468
01:26:55,791 --> 01:26:58,430
retrieved. It's air gapped,
written down on a piece of paper.

1469
01:26:58,430 --> 01:27:01,070
So if it's really important,
uh, think about that.

1470
01:27:01,071 --> 01:27:03,860
We talked about some of
the travel tips earlier.

1471
01:27:03,890 --> 01:27:08,120
The last thing that I would mention is
to red team and test your assumptions.

1472
01:27:08,121 --> 01:27:10,010
Red Team is a term from the military.

1473
01:27:10,220 --> 01:27:11,900
You kind of have the blue
team and the right team.

1474
01:27:11,901 --> 01:27:13,070
The blue team is United States.

1475
01:27:13,071 --> 01:27:16,970
The red team is always the bad guys in
the military trains this way where they

1476
01:27:16,971 --> 01:27:20,030
use, you know, sets of bad guys
to try to break their stuff.

1477
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:23,930
I can guarantee you that if you're doing
anything interesting on the internet or

1478
01:27:23,931 --> 01:27:27,440
in your personal life, there's somebody
who's trying to get access to it.

1479
01:27:27,441 --> 01:27:31,400
It may not be an individual hacker sitting
at a keyboard targeting you because

1480
01:27:31,401 --> 01:27:34,730
as I mentioned earlier, a lot of
these attacks can be scripted. I,

1481
01:27:34,740 --> 01:27:37,010
the thing I hear all the time
is, oh, I've got nothing to hide.

1482
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:40,340
I've got nothing to lose. Then you
don't lead a very interesting life.

1483
01:27:40,370 --> 01:27:44,720
If that's the case, um, I would think
we all have something at risk here.

1484
01:27:44,990 --> 01:27:47,930
And so you should be
testing those assumptions.

1485
01:27:47,931 --> 01:27:50,120
And because if you're not
trying to hack yourself,

1486
01:27:50,121 --> 01:27:53,570
the bad guys are so better that
you uncover those threats first.

1487
01:27:54,010 --> 01:27:58,540
No, definitely. And just to your point, I
mean there's some real hot beds, I think,

1488
01:27:58,600 --> 01:28:00,280
I want to say Estonia for some reason,

1489
01:28:00,281 --> 01:28:03,550
but it might be brought a Slava
somewhere out in that neck of the woods.

1490
01:28:03,820 --> 01:28:08,320
I mean their, their entire cottage
industries that have popped up in Romania,

1491
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:11,553
Romania,

1492
01:28:11,560 --> 01:28:13,060
it's actually called like,
you know,

1493
01:28:13,061 --> 01:28:16,900
the cybercrime headquarters of
the world where it's very funny,

1494
01:28:16,901 --> 01:28:19,810
they have something like
500 people in this village,

1495
01:28:20,020 --> 01:28:24,460
but that one western union office in
Romania does more than most of western

1496
01:28:24,461 --> 01:28:28,570
Europe because of all the
illegal cybercrime payments
coming in there. So, uh,

1497
01:28:28,571 --> 01:28:31,570
and in Nigeria they have what
are called the Yahoo Boys.

1498
01:28:31,780 --> 01:28:34,630
These are the ones that send out
all of those emails, you know,

1499
01:28:34,631 --> 01:28:35,890
trying to trick you.
So yeah,

1500
01:28:35,891 --> 01:28:40,060
there's definitely a very vibrant
cybercrime economy out there.

1501
01:28:40,330 --> 01:28:43,030
A study by McAfee and CSI has,

1502
01:28:43,031 --> 01:28:48,031
I think tank in DC estimated the global
cyber economy at $400 billion a year.

1503
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:49,473
It's tremendous.

1504
01:28:50,290 --> 01:28:55,060
That is so wild. Yeah. And growing,
uh, no, uh, no doubt about it.

1505
01:28:55,410 --> 01:28:57,370
Uh, well I would, uh,

1506
01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:02,370
I think this is a good round
two round one rather for us.

1507
01:29:02,371 --> 01:29:04,320
I'm already looking for around two.
So I think,

1508
01:29:04,770 --> 01:29:07,170
I think this is a good
introduction for folks,

1509
01:29:07,171 --> 01:29:11,430
gives them plenty to think
about. Uh, any, uh, okay,

1510
01:29:11,431 --> 01:29:12,210
here's one for you.

1511
01:29:12,210 --> 01:29:17,210
Do you have any habits
that a peep that may,

1512
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:22,290
might be nonobvious to
people or our habits that you
think improve your security

1513
01:29:22,291 --> 01:29:25,830
or give you peace of mind that,
uh, other people find odd?

1514
01:29:26,550 --> 01:29:26,731
Well,

1515
01:29:26,731 --> 01:29:31,200
one that I get commented on all the time
is if you look at any of my devices,

1516
01:29:31,201 --> 01:29:35,040
whether it be my cell phone and
my laptop or my computers at home,

1517
01:29:35,340 --> 01:29:39,450
they all have yellow stickies over
the camera. The fact of the matter is,

1518
01:29:39,451 --> 01:29:41,370
is that not only can
people hack your camera,

1519
01:29:41,371 --> 01:29:45,950
but they can hack it in a way such that
the little green or red light isn't on.

1520
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:48,960
And we had, there's malware out there,
so that does this really easily.

1521
01:29:48,961 --> 01:29:51,740
I mentioned black shades
earlier that we'll do that. Uh,

1522
01:29:51,750 --> 01:29:55,950
there was a girl called Cassidy wolf
who was miss teen America and she went

1523
01:29:55,951 --> 01:29:58,290
ahead and had her camera taken over.

1524
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:00,330
Ultimately we found out
by one of her classmates,

1525
01:30:00,331 --> 01:30:03,240
she clicked on infected email
and as miss teen America,

1526
01:30:03,241 --> 01:30:07,470
17 year old girl was coming out
of her own bathroom. You know,

1527
01:30:07,471 --> 01:30:09,660
after taking a shower,
her laptop was open.

1528
01:30:09,930 --> 01:30:14,730
This creep was going ahead
and surreptitiously filming
her and taking the video

1529
01:30:14,970 --> 01:30:17,250
and then blackmailed her
and said, hey, you know,

1530
01:30:17,251 --> 01:30:20,280
if you don't do specific sex acts
for me in front of the video,

1531
01:30:20,281 --> 01:30:24,660
I'm going to release all this stuff
live. Uh, so I, uh, unlike teen America,

1532
01:30:24,690 --> 01:30:27,390
people are not lying naked,

1533
01:30:27,660 --> 01:30:32,430
but I still go ahead and cover up the
video camera and it's super cheap to do

1534
01:30:32,431 --> 01:30:35,070
and it's, you know, it's, it's
just something to keep in mind.

1535
01:30:35,530 --> 01:30:38,620
So funny you mentioned that
I have masking tape over my,

1536
01:30:39,730 --> 01:30:43,600
over my camera on my laptop right now
because I was hanging out with a buddy of

1537
01:30:43,601 --> 01:30:48,100
mine who in a previous life got in a
lot of trouble with the FBI for hacking.

1538
01:30:48,380 --> 01:30:52,110
He is a, he is a world
class hacker. He, I mean,

1539
01:30:52,111 --> 01:30:54,760
if you want to talk about a very
competent red team, he now gets it.

1540
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:58,120
He now gets paid by companies to do that,
to try to beat their systems,

1541
01:30:58,121 --> 01:31:02,560
which he usually does successfully.
Uh, and he said, you know,

1542
01:31:02,561 --> 01:31:04,540
you might wanna put some tape on that. And
I was like, what are you talking about?

1543
01:31:04,541 --> 01:31:06,970
And he's like, well, like if I wanted to
hijack your computer and videotape you,

1544
01:31:06,971 --> 01:31:11,440
I could do it pretty easily. And I
was like, okay, say no more. Right.

1545
01:31:11,890 --> 01:31:16,210
Uh, and I've actually heard of business
travelers who have been blackmailed very

1546
01:31:16,211 --> 01:31:17,600
similarly.
Uh,

1547
01:31:17,620 --> 01:31:22,620
usually female travelers who have
had people attach cameras to their,

1548
01:31:23,590 --> 01:31:27,150
their hotel up peoples
from the opposite side.

1549
01:31:27,490 --> 01:31:29,140
And so business travelers,

1550
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:33,160
there's some different business travelers
I know who will similarly cover up

1551
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:37,550
that, um, cover up that
keyhole so that, uh,

1552
01:31:37,630 --> 01:31:39,370
people cannot surveil them.

1553
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:41,920
Absolutely. Talking
about cameras, you know,

1554
01:31:41,950 --> 01:31:46,150
I mentioned earlier that everything is
becoming software or hardware and the

1555
01:31:46,151 --> 01:31:47,950
cameras are perfect example of that.
You know,

1556
01:31:47,951 --> 01:31:50,980
we all go ahead and
have cameras around us,

1557
01:31:50,981 --> 01:31:54,760
not just on our cell phones are on our
laptops, but everywhere we go, right,

1558
01:31:54,761 --> 01:31:58,720
there are now cameras at the dry cleaners,
cameras at the bakery, cameras at the,

1559
01:31:59,620 --> 01:32:03,370
and all of those cameras are connected
to the Internet and they're all hackable.

1560
01:32:03,371 --> 01:32:04,750
And some crazy number,

1561
01:32:04,751 --> 01:32:09,040
like 30 to 40% of all camera
systems have absolutely no password.

1562
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:14,110
And another 30 or 40% have the admin
password that's written in the manual

1563
01:32:14,111 --> 01:32:16,060
that's available on pdf on the internet.

1564
01:32:16,061 --> 01:32:17,800
If you Google the name
of the camera system.

1565
01:32:18,100 --> 01:32:21,070
So that means they're widely
available to be hacked.

1566
01:32:21,071 --> 01:32:24,460
And yet people use things like
baby monitors, nanny cams,

1567
01:32:24,461 --> 01:32:28,470
things like that to protect themselves.
And we're finding that a,

1568
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:32,100
they're just easy marks. Within
the past week actually, uh,

1569
01:32:32,150 --> 01:32:34,060
here in late October,

1570
01:32:34,061 --> 01:32:39,061
we had an incident where it was reported
that 76,000 camera systems had been

1571
01:32:39,431 --> 01:32:41,890
compromised and we're being
live streamed to the web.

1572
01:32:42,070 --> 01:32:45,400
So you could log in because all of these
cameras that had been hacked and easily

1573
01:32:45,401 --> 01:32:48,430
taken over and you could see
women sitting on the couch,

1574
01:32:48,431 --> 01:32:50,500
you could see people in
their bedroom having sex.

1575
01:32:50,710 --> 01:32:54,370
You could see mothers breastfeeding their
kids, people sitting in dry cleaners,

1576
01:32:54,371 --> 01:32:55,810
you know,
cooking stuff at bakeries.

1577
01:32:56,050 --> 01:32:59,350
So we think these systems
are there to protect us,

1578
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:03,310
but in fact they can be compromised and
used in really interesting ways if you

1579
01:33:03,311 --> 01:33:05,290
have time. I'll tell you
another funny story about that.

1580
01:33:05,560 --> 01:33:06,393
I have time.

1581
01:33:06,670 --> 01:33:11,290
Awesome. There was a case called the
crown casino in Melbourne, Australia.

1582
01:33:11,291 --> 01:33:15,910
This happened about a year ago and a man
comes in and starts playing poker and

1583
01:33:15,911 --> 01:33:19,570
he's doing really, really well.
He ends up playing for two days,

1584
01:33:19,571 --> 01:33:23,440
almost straight and he walks away
from the crown casino in Melbourne,

1585
01:33:23,441 --> 01:33:27,220
Australia with $33 million playing poker,

1586
01:33:27,550 --> 01:33:31,150
gets back on a plane and flies
back to his home country in Asia.

1587
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:35,380
What the hell happened? Because the
casino got cleaned out. They had no idea.

1588
01:33:35,650 --> 01:33:39,760
They ended up looking at it and it turns
out that he was part of a hacker team

1589
01:33:40,030 --> 01:33:43,360
that went ahead and hacked the
security cameras in casinos. You know,

1590
01:33:43,361 --> 01:33:48,130
all casinos have a ton of cameras and
the hackers that were working with this

1591
01:33:48,131 --> 01:33:53,110
guy had given him an earpiece. And
so with the, by having common deer,

1592
01:33:53,140 --> 01:33:57,010
the casinos own security system that
could see perfectly clearly what the

1593
01:33:57,011 --> 01:34:01,480
dealer's cards are and the players of
all the different players at the table.

1594
01:34:01,481 --> 01:34:05,110
And they were basically via electronic
message into his ear, telling him,

1595
01:34:05,111 --> 01:34:10,030
you know, stay pat whole DoubleDown all of
that stuff. And just 48 hours, you know,

1596
01:34:10,060 --> 01:34:11,260
33 million bucks.

1597
01:34:11,500 --> 01:34:14,320
So the cameras that are meant to protect
us if they're not locked down and

1598
01:34:14,321 --> 01:34:16,360
encrypted can definitely
be used against us.

1599
01:34:16,620 --> 01:34:20,670
Wow. Yeah. Good. Good luck.
Extraditing that guy. Yeah, exactly.

1600
01:34:20,770 --> 01:34:25,230
Aww Man, he can now afford
a good defense. I bet.

1601
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:30,000
Wow. Well, there's so much more
to talk about, but uh, I will, uh,

1602
01:34:30,690 --> 01:34:34,350
I will certainly look forward
to some follow on conversations.

1603
01:34:34,351 --> 01:34:35,970
Maybe we'll inject some wine into the,

1604
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:40,980
into the mix to make things a more
rambunctious. But, uh, but, uh,

1605
01:34:40,981 --> 01:34:42,630
since I know we're,
we're practically neighbors,

1606
01:34:42,810 --> 01:34:46,290
I even know we're doing
this virtually, uh, the,

1607
01:34:46,291 --> 01:34:50,460
I would love to meet you in person someday
and hang out again. Likewise. And, uh,

1608
01:34:50,490 --> 01:34:51,930
the,
the,

1609
01:34:52,590 --> 01:34:56,400
the recommendation I'd make to folks
is a good a future crimes.com check.

1610
01:34:56,401 --> 01:34:57,234
Check this out.

1611

1654
01:37:38,450 --> 01:37:42,590
Ex-Officio boy, where do I begin? I
have a long history with ex-officio.

1655
01:37:42,890 --> 01:37:47,890
Ex-Officio makes clothing and as far
back as 2007 2008 I had a hit video that

1656
01:37:50,061 --> 01:37:53,000
went viral called how to travel
the world with 10 pounds or less.

1657
01:37:53,001 --> 01:37:57,750
And I talked about ex-officio underwear.
Ex-Officio underwear is lightweight,

1658
01:37:57,990 --> 01:38:01,920
ultra lightweight, quick
drying and antimicrobial.
Why is this important? Well,

1659
01:38:01,921 --> 01:38:04,800
I've gone through 20 plus countries
with two pairs of underwear before,

1660
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:09,000
both from ex-officio, and I'm not
alone in this. This might sound crazy,

1661
01:38:09,001 --> 01:38:12,210
but a lot of executives, for
instance, we'll take this underwear,

1662
01:38:12,580 --> 01:38:15,600
they'll wash it in the sink or
somewhere else, roll it up into towel,

1663
01:38:15,601 --> 01:38:20,160
like a Burrito step on it, and a few
hours later they are completely dry,

1664
01:38:20,161 --> 01:38:23,250
completely clean. You don't
have to just have to, and yes,

1665
01:38:23,251 --> 01:38:25,260
they have to be comfortable
for all day wear,

1666
01:38:25,590 --> 01:38:28,200
but check out their clothing
as well as their underwear.

1667

but this underwear,

1670
