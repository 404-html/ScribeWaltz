1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,880
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02,881 --> 00:00:06,060
I can run flat out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,030
I'm a cybernetic organism living.

4
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,470
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to
another episode of the Tim Ferriss show.

5
00:00:27,471 --> 00:00:29,300
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for tuning in.

6
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:33,770
This episode is a followup
and an experimental episode.

7
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:37,400
Each of these interviews
they're typically interviews,

8
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:41,360
consists of me trying to
deconstruct a world class performer,

9
00:00:41,361 --> 00:00:45,860
whether they be an investor,
a chess prodigy and athlete or otherwise.

10
00:00:45,861 --> 00:00:48,050
To pull out the tips and
tricks that you can use.

11
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:53,350
A recent episode that with
Pavel Tsatsouline who is
an elite physical training

12
00:00:55,251 --> 00:00:58,340
instructor. He's been involved
with training the spit nos,

13
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:00,470
the elite Soviet special forces units,

14
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:04,680
also the Marine Corps Secret
Service Navy seals. Uh,

15
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:09,700
he did an episode that ended up being a
masterclass in strength training and it

16
00:01:10,281 --> 00:01:14,000
was so popular that we decided
to do a round two on this.

17
00:01:14,001 --> 00:01:17,150
Round two in both of these can
be listened to independently,

18
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:22,630
consists of the most popular 15
questions as voted up by hundreds of you.

19
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:27,380
So hundreds of you submitted
questions voted on them.

20
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:32,590
The top 15 which covered just about
everything you can imagine are those that

21
00:01:33,081 --> 00:01:36,350
Pavel we'll be answering in this episode.
One piece of housekeeping,

22
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:41,620

24
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:48,700
that's Sir Richard Branson's private

25
00:01:48,801 --> 00:01:51,980

Without further ado,

34
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:27,000
here is round to the Q and a by
popular demand with Pavel Tsatsouline.

35
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:30,730
Ladies and Gentlemen,

36
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,810
it is my pleasure to be speaking
to Tim Ferriss audience again.

37
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:39,750
You have asked me a number of
questions, excellent questions. And uh,

38
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,310
I will answer us on them today.

39
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,270
Many of the questions had to do with
nutrition. It is not my specialty,

40
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,910
so I will not be answering
them with one exception.

41
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:54,600
The question by Carl from
Indiana on the podcast,

42
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:58,200
you asked Pavle if he had tricks
regarding the challenges of eating for

43
00:02:58,201 --> 00:03:00,580
hypertrophy and he said
he would mention them,

44
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:05,030
but you guys never had time
to circle back. Well, Carl,

45
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,010
to put on muscle,

46
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:11,950
it's a very costly proposition for
your body to put it on in, to keep it,

47
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,880
it takes a lot of energy.

48
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:18,910
It takes a lot of plastic resources
and the buddies very reluctant to add

49
00:03:19,251 --> 00:03:22,160
muscle,
especially past a certain point.

50
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,170
So you must convince it that
food is not only available,

51
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,710
the food is abundant,
the food is overly abundant.

52
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,900
So the tactic used by number of lifters,

53
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,080
top lifters like Kirk Kolasky to get
themselves past a sticking point and keep

54
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:45,130
putting muscle on was to add a
feeding in the middle of the night.

55
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,020
That's right. You just get some
food, a solid food or liquid food,

56
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:54,380
high protein food on your nightstand,
something that you wouldn't mind, uh,

57
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,390
gagging down and in the middle of the
night you just throw it down the hatch.

58
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:02,870
Nobody's said it would be easy and uh,
nobody said it would be health.

59
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:12,660
Mikey from Dublin is wondering what
is the optimal way to combine strength

60
00:04:12,701 --> 00:04:17,350
training and high it for
training. Obviously there
are many ways of doing that,

61
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:20,590
but if we were to look for
the minimalist approach,

62
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,940
simply focusing most of your
energy on doing sets of five,

63
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:28,410
when you do a set of five as confirmed,

64
00:04:28,411 --> 00:04:32,940
both by research and experience in the
trenches gives you the best of both

65
00:04:32,941 --> 00:04:37,290
worlds, delivers muscle and
delivers strength bar to you,

66
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:38,490
Mikey and muscle too.

67
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,750
The next question is from,

68
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,660
and pardon me if I'm not
pronouncing the name correctly,

69
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,120
Josue led desmo from New York City.

70
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:55,420
What would be the 80 20 training method
to build strength and overall fitness?

71
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:00,370
The answer is without any doubt
correct kettlebell training.

72
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:06,330
When one tries to develop all
fitness components, strength,
endurance, flexibility,

73
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,640
power,
using the same modality,

74
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:14,060
usually he ends up with a whole lot of
compromises by the kettle bell when used

75
00:05:14,461 --> 00:05:19,461
correctly for some reason allows you to
avoid this problem and develop all these

76
00:05:20,261 --> 00:05:21,370
components to a high level.

77
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:26,140
We even have an expression
in the Kettlebell world
that what the hell effect.

78
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:31,030
Let's say that you're doing kettlebell
exercises and suddenly you'd go out and

79
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:32,080
test yourself at something,

80
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:36,030
have not been practicing and it
turns out you can do more pull ups.

81
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,940
You can walk with,
they have your weight much faster.

82
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:43,850
You can lift heavier weight off the
ground. That's the what the hell effect.

83
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:45,540
And uh,

84
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,600
there are a number of Soviet studies in
the eighties confirming that and in the

85
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,740
last several years there've been a number
of studies done in the West as well

86
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,830
and you can find them on pub med.

87
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:02,690
Now speaking of specific training program,

88
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:08,470
I recommend three highest yield exercises
that also have the steepest learning

89
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:12,620
curve.
They are the one arm swing,

90
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:15,900
the getup and the goblet squat.

91
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:21,000
Just do this reaction sizes
that were referred to as a
program minimum every day.

92
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,170
And uh,

93
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:26,460
I guarantee that you're going to get
a great return on your investment.

94
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:30,843
Okay.

95
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:34,090
The next question is from
Jdk from San Francisco.

96
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:38,300
You mentioned the podcast that prior
to strength training you need proper

97
00:06:38,301 --> 00:06:39,134
alignment.

98
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,130
I struggled with this one side is shorter
than the other and a weaker than the

99
00:06:43,131 --> 00:06:47,120
other. What can I doctor, should I
see and what steps should I take?

100
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:48,871
First of all,

101
00:06:48,871 --> 00:06:53,871
find a sports sports doctor
or chiropractor who is an
athlete and the lifter and

102
00:06:55,701 --> 00:06:59,180
works with athletes and lifters.
It's a very important step.

103
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:04,700
My personal rule is I would never go to
a chiropractor who dead lifts less than

104
00:07:04,701 --> 00:07:08,190
I do.
And after that,

105
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:12,270
I suggest that you find yourself
an fms certified specialist,

106
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,890
fms or functional movement screen. You
can read about it in the four hour body.

107
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,740
Greg Cook is the Osr and uh,

108
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:24,630
it's a terrific system for assessing your
symmetry and helping you improve your

109
00:07:24,631 --> 00:07:25,464
performance.

110
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,533
Okay.

111
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,860
Jeffrey.
John from Edmonton,

112
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:36,950
Alberta is writing any tips for
developing conditioning are appreciate it.

113
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:42,730
Let's start with the efficiency.
That means posture and relaxation.

114
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:45,800
If your head is sticking forward,

115
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:50,120
your running speed and endurance
is going to be compromised.

116
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,460
The same thing can be said
about your gas in the ring.

117
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,860
So work on your posture.

118
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,970
Relaxation in the Soviet Union,

119
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:06,800
it was a standard practice for all kids
in grade school to practice relaxation

120
00:08:07,461 --> 00:08:08,294
exercises.

121
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:12,530
And it's the same practice that stayed
with all the athletes all the way to the

122
00:08:12,531 --> 00:08:15,680
Olympics.
So these exercises are very simple.

123
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:18,710
They pretty much mean
shaking your muscles out.

124
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,370
So start shaking you arms,
shaking your legs, vibrate him,

125
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,150
and imagine that you're trying to shake
water off your limbs and practicing

126
00:08:28,151 --> 00:08:32,350
these exercises regularly
between sets of your, uh,

127
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:37,470
strength exercises during your athletic
practice is going to go a very long way

128
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,260
towards making you more enduring
and making it faster as well.

129
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:42,450
Yeah.

130
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,620
Uh,
Arctic,

131
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:48,640
you're a type of running is going to
help you with being more relaxed and more

132
00:08:49,741 --> 00:08:50,574
enduring.

133
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:55,900
Just go out on a run without looking the
clock and focus and being as relaxed as

134
00:08:58,141 --> 00:09:03,000
possible and go as far as possible
while being as relaxed as possible.

135
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:06,300
And uh,
as you keep doing that,

136
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:11,130
eventually all you'll have to do is just
add some gas and you're going to run

137
00:09:11,131 --> 00:09:11,964
faster.

138
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:19,010
Next item would be strengthening your
respiratory muscles or breathing muscles.

139
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,920
Research tells us that the metabolites
from your respiratory muscles,

140
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:29,430
which means all the waste
products from this muscles,

141
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:35,090
makes the blood vessels in
your limbs get constricted.

142
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,260
So think about it this way.

143
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:42,290
You start sucking wind and then as
if it wasn't bad enough already,

144
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:47,930
you get this extra punishment of the
plumbing in your legs start shutting down.

145
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:53,930
So the same research tells us that
strengthening your respiratory muscles is

146
00:09:55,411 --> 00:10:00,411
going to increase your
endurance by preventing this
reflexive Vasa constriction.

147
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:06,990
How do we do that?
In Our kettlebell practice,

148
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:10,830
we do something called the
biomechanical breathing match.

149
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:15,570
So let's say we were performing
as set of swings on the way down.

150
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:19,320
We sharply inhale into the
abdomen through the nose.

151
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:23,040
So you're inhaling against the resistance
of your muscles and against the

152
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:28,041
resistance of the weight and on the
way up you're forcefully exhaling as if

153
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:32,940
you're striking. That's called
the biomechanical breathing match.

154
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:35,790
So that's how we strengthen
our breathing muscles.

155
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:41,130
Then there is such a thing as
the breathing discipline. Uh,

156
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:46,110
breathing ladder is a very
effective technique developed
bottom of my colleagues

157
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:50,010
rob Lawrence. Let's say this,
you're doing a set of swings,

158
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,580
kettlebell swings,
or a sprint.

159
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:56,790
Any type of an exercise
that makes you gassed,

160
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:02,450
decide that you're going to rest from
this set to the next according to a

161
00:11:03,601 --> 00:11:04,920
certain number of breaths.

162
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:09,930
So let's say you get to do five
breaths until the next set,

163
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:13,920
and this is going to discipline
you to slow your breathing down,

164
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,890
slow your physiology down,
stop panicking.

165
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:20,220
That's also going to
help with your endurance.

166
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,240
One more thing to say is,
uh,

167
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,260
you can develop mitochondria
and your fast twitch fibers,

168
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,890
which is going to enable them
to be much more enduring,

169
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,980
to be able to use oxygen in the podcast.

170
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:40,170
I already mentioned building up slow
fibers that already come equipped with

171
00:11:40,171 --> 00:11:41,004
Mitochondria,

172
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:46,610
but you can also build these mitochondria
oxygen using mitochondria into the

173
00:11:47,101 --> 00:11:49,860
existing fast fibers.
So how do we do that?

174
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:55,460
We do that by exerting the muscle's very
powerfully for a very short period of

175
00:11:56,531 --> 00:11:59,800
time, typically 10, 15 seconds,

176
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:04,390
and after that resting actively
for a fairly long time.

177
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,200
So a rest work to rest ratio may be as uh,

178
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:13,960
as high as one to five or even one to six.

179
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:19,620
That might mean that you would do a ten
second effort followed by 50 seconds of

180
00:12:20,561 --> 00:12:23,500
rest. It seems quite easy, but, uh,

181
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:28,240
until you realize that you have to
maintain that power output every time,

182
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:30,430
very high maximum power output.

183
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:35,410
And you have to do this up
to eventually up to 40 sets.

184
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:36,320
That's another,

185
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,320
the protocols by professor silly Yana
so arrest actively between this sets,

186
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:47,020
which means kind of move
around, jog lightly, uh,

187
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,440
shake your muscles out the way.
I told you to do this earlier,

188
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,580
and you can do this couple of times a
week or eventually you can even do this

189
00:12:54,581 --> 00:12:55,570
possibly every day.

190
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:06,010
Tyler EHC from New Jersey is asking you,

191
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:09,700
talk a bit in the interview with Tim
about how important it is in exercise

192
00:13:09,701 --> 00:13:13,540
sports in life to be able to
switch yourself on and off.

193
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,420
What are your favorite
techniques for making this rapid,

194
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,670
efficient and achievable by anyone?

195
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:26,010
It's true that most people exist between
the on and the off switch and they're

196
00:13:26,201 --> 00:13:30,670
unable to really turn on
to put out high power.

197
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:36,060
They are unknown enabled to really switch
off and enjoy some rest or just have

198
00:13:36,461 --> 00:13:39,520
some endurance.
So there's several things that you can do.

199
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:43,900
One hour to mentioned is those uh,
relaxation exercises,

200
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,450
fast and loose exercises,
just shake your limbs.

201
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:51,010
And other technique
that you could use is a,

202
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:54,940
it's an old technique called Jacobson's
per progressive relaxation training.

203
00:13:55,540 --> 00:14:00,540
It pretty much means lying down and then
progressively tensing all your muscles

204
00:14:01,421 --> 00:14:03,240
and then relaxing them in a,

205
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:08,260
in a particular order that makes you
aware of the tension and then makes you

206
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:13,060
release the tension through all the day.
And during your training,

207
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,710
you should be particularly aware of your
facial tension because that takes a lot

208
00:14:17,711 --> 00:14:21,010
of effort and it does drain you.
So be impassive

209
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:27,220
meditation, breathing exercises
from Yoga, from Cathay and so on.

210
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:28,540
Definitely very helpful.

211
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:33,010
One of the comes to turning yourself on.

212
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:39,010
The first thing you can do is do
a proper set of morning exercises.

213
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:44,700
So I've had to research decades ago
established that if you do at pleasant,

214
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:50,440
not exhausting a series of
exercises in the morning,

215
00:14:50,441 --> 00:14:53,630
just some sort calisthenics,
joint rotations, arm swings,

216
00:14:53,631 --> 00:14:57,680
whatever you will accelerate,

217
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:01,790
you will accelerate your ability to
perform at a high level by a couple hours.

218
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:06,170
So you will reach that peak of performance
early in the morning as opposed to

219
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:10,970
waiting for it later and later
throughout the day. Your ability to,

220
00:15:10,971 --> 00:15:14,690
uh, access that performance is
going to be greater as well.

221
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:20,510
Back to breathing practices. There
are some special exercises in, uh,

222
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,900
some oriental practices like Cathay.

223
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:26,600
There's the bookie breathing that
helps you to turn yourself on,

224
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:30,260
get some more power,
get some more aggression.

225
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:36,940
I strongly recommend one book to the
book is called Psych by Dr Bai's Soto.

226
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:41,810
Doctor Dad buys Soto by his own admission,

227
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,690
looked like a 11 year old stamp collector,

228
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:49,820
and yet he proceeded to began one of
the most successful power lifters in

229
00:15:49,821 --> 00:15:54,821
history at the age of
44 after back surgery,

230
00:15:55,940 --> 00:16:00,940
he's squatted over 600 pounds at body
weight of one 32 which is absolutely

231
00:16:01,491 --> 00:16:06,491
amazing and he achieved that ability
largely through his mental training,

232
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:14,180
jogged reached the point where he would
wait for his attempt as other lifters

233
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:15,410
are waiting for their attempts.

234
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,640
Judd would be just sleeping and then just
a couple of minutes before the attempt,

235
00:16:19,641 --> 00:16:21,830
his coach would wake him up,
he would get up,

236
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:25,970
he would work himself into a frenzy.
He would go out,

237
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,360
lift a record,
and then just go back to sleep.

238
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,590
Now that's an amazing control of
your on switch and you're off switch.

239
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:38,390
The title of the book again is
psych by Dr Judd Baez. Soto,

240
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:43,990
spelled B.

241
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,260
I A. S. O. T. T. O. Josh
Elbaz from Montreal is asking,

242
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:59,540
what's the quickest way to improve a
strict barbell military press from three

243
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:02,780
quarters of your body
weight to body weight?

244
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:05,420
Given that my grip and
abs are already strong,

245
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:12,380
Russian weightlifters have a saying
to press a lot. You must press a lot.

246
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:16,700
The press responds exception, the wealth
through a high volume of training.

247
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:22,300
What does it mean typically 20 to 50
reps per session three times a week.

248
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:28,400
That's a lot of presses. All these
presses are done in low repetitions,

249
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:33,500
one to five more typical to three and
four, but one to five. That's the range.

250
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:36,020
And you never go to a failure.

251
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:41,200
So typically you stay with one third
to two thirds of your Max Reps.

252
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,673
So what does it mean?

253
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:47,270
It means that if you're able
to do 10 reps with that weight,

254
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:51,660
you should really only be
doing three to six repetitions.

255
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:55,430
So one more time to press a lot.
You must press a lot.

256
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:05,810
Could you elaborate a neurological
strengths? Please? Asks. Reimagined. Yes.

257
00:18:05,811 --> 00:18:07,250
From Miami,
Florida.

258
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:13,240
Think of your muscles as
a six cylinder engine.

259
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,600
And right now you are firing
only on three cylinders.

260
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:22,550
You could get stronger by adding
several more cylinders and that'll be

261
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:27,710
hypertrophy or you could fix that engine
and learn how to take advantage of the

262
00:18:28,481 --> 00:18:29,680
cylinders you already do have.

263
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,470
That's the essence of
neurological strength training.

264
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:38,230
Pretty much what you do is you learn how
to activate your muscles more intensely.

265
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:44,150
It's done by training with low repetitions
is done by training with heavier

266
00:18:44,151 --> 00:18:48,270
weights.
It's done by a perfect practice.

267
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:51,750
Approaching your training, not
as a workout, but as a practice.

268
00:18:56,570 --> 00:19:00,870
Nick m from Erie,
Pennsylvania is asking in the podcast,

269
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:03,930
it's mentioned that to build
strengths you shouldn't go to failure.

270
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:07,200
How do you know when to add more
weight if you're not going to failure?

271
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,350
And Kaelin from Denver
as a similar question,

272
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:13,750
you need to use your
perceived rate of exertion.

273
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:19,140
So on the scale of one to 10 let's say
that your typical sets takes you eight

274
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:24,870
units of effort and you were staying
with this weight and couple of weeks from

275
00:19:24,871 --> 00:19:29,871
now lifting the same weight takes
six or seven units of effort.

276
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:31,950
You know that you've gotten stronger.

277
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:42,140
Kid from San Francisco is asking what
is the best way to gain strength as you

278
00:19:42,571 --> 00:19:43,404
get older,

279
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:48,820
his book power to the people espoused
heavy lifts but going on 39 years old,

280
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:53,680
I'm finding that this routine is way
all cabs way too hard on my joints.

281
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:58,810
Step one,
go get your joints checked by a doctor.

282
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,300
Step two,
get your head in the right place.

283
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:08,470
My father is 77 years old and he's done
lifting or for a hundred pounds without

284
00:20:08,661 --> 00:20:11,790
a belt and he does not
think himself as old.

285
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:16,283
Yeah,

286
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:21,360
Dylan from Los Angeles is wondering when
does the five minute rest between sets

287
00:20:21,361 --> 00:20:22,980
apply,
when does it not?

288
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,980
There are three types of rest intervals.

289
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:32,370
There is ordinary stress and stimulating
an ordinary interval allows you to

290
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:39,460
pretty much recover your performance level
by the time the next set rolls around

291
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:45,080
and that's roughly three to five
minutes as stress interval I accumulated

292
00:20:45,081 --> 00:20:47,060
fatigue.
So the more sense you,

293
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:52,610
the more tired you get and finalists
stimulating interval allows you to perform

294
00:20:52,771 --> 00:20:56,130
better in the next set and
then may take 12 minutes or so.

295
00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:00,590
So unless your training
program says otherwise,

296
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:04,460
just go with the ordinary interval
at about three to five minutes.

297
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:11,810
Trey from Denver,
Colorado is asking,

298
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:15,260
the army still has sit ups
in the physical fitness test,

299
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,560
any advice and training in
maximizing the repetitions.

300
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:23,050
First, get your abs strong, really strong.

301
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:28,030
That means three to five sets of three
to five reps with three to five minutes

302
00:21:28,031 --> 00:21:33,031
in between of an exercise that puts a
lot of tension on your abdominal muscles.

303
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:38,440
That could be strict hanging
leg raises. That can be, uh,

304
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,840
the abdominal wheel,

305
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:44,060
that can be strict weighted sit ups.

306
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:46,320
So once you've gotten that strength,

307
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:51,920
then just do a very minimal practice of
your repetitions set up test and you'll

308
00:21:51,991 --> 00:21:53,070
have no problem.

309
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:57,663
Okay.

310
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:00,670
Swash from Columbus,
Ohio is asking,

311
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:04,400
I know the deadlift is
one of the best exercises,

312
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,020
but I've gotten terrible back
spasms from doing it. Is it my form?

313
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,470
Can I have proximity?

314
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:13,090
They deadlifts effects with something
else that doesn't possibly injure me.

315
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:17,550
Step one,
see a duck and lifting doc.

316
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,100
Find out what your restrictions
and limitations are.

317
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:26,720
Either you will learn that you
can deadlift with proper form,

318
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:31,620
possibly with some corrective exercises
or you have to look for an alternative.

319
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:36,450
If the answer to the deadlift is yes,
then find a coach,

320
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:39,150
a good power lifting coach
and learn how to do trite.

321
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:43,990
If the answer is no as good
doctor for some other suggestions,

322
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:46,960
ask your doc above the Kettlebell swing.

323
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:52,050
Very often people who are not able to
lift heavy barbells are able to safely do

324
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:53,703
the Kettlebell swing.

325
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:03,480
H F VK from Norway who appears to be a
personal trainer is asking how would you

326
00:23:03,651 --> 00:23:07,280
go about building the discipline
required to be great in a client?

327
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:13,850
Stop treating people
you're training as clients,

328
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,860
hair salons of clients.

329
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:19,770
A client is somebody who's
passively receiving a service.

330
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:25,530
You want them to think of themselves as
students and you want to treat them as

331
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:26,423
students.

332
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:35,520
Tim, thank you for having me on your
show, ladies and gentlemen, bar too.
