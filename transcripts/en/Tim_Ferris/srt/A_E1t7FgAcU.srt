Hello boys and girls.

65
00:04:10,431 --> 00:04:13,730
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another
episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

66
00:04:13,731 --> 00:04:16,820
it is my job to deconstruct
world class performers,

67
00:04:16,821 --> 00:04:20,540
people who are exceptionally good at
what they do. To tease out the routines,

68
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:21,590
habits,
favorite books,

69
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:26,150
and so on that you can hopefully
test and apply to your own lives.

70
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:30,710
And my guest today is none
other than drew Houstin,

71
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:34,430
h. O u s t o n at drew Houstin
on Twitter and elsewhere.

72
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:39,080
He's the cofounder and CEO of Dropbox
since founding the company in 2007 with a

73
00:04:39,081 --> 00:04:39,980
rush for dozy,

74
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:44,420
drew has led the company's growth from
a simple idea to a service used by 500

75
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,610
million people around the world.
You can let that number sink in.

76
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,850
Drew received his bachelor's degree
in electrical engineering and computer

77
00:04:49,851 --> 00:04:54,080
science from Mit in 2006 I think I've
heard of that place. After graduating,

78
00:04:54,081 --> 00:04:58,190
he turned his frustration with carrying
USB drives and emailing files to himself

79
00:04:58,191 --> 00:05:01,510
into a demo for what then became Dropbox.
Today,

80
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:05,390
Dropbox is one of the world's leading
business collaboration platforms with 11

81
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:10,390
million paying subscribers and 1800
plus employees across 12 global offices.

82
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,990
Drew, welcome to the
show. Thank you. You know,

83
00:05:14,991 --> 00:05:19,991
I've wanted to have an excuse to ask
you for your life story and all of these

84
00:05:21,381 --> 00:05:23,210
details because we've known
each other quite a while,

85
00:05:23,211 --> 00:05:27,980
but it's super weird to sit down with
a glass of wine at a dinner table or

86
00:05:27,981 --> 00:05:31,920
something like that and just start
asking you for your doctor evil story.

87
00:05:31,921 --> 00:05:34,880
So this is, this is a fun
opportunity for me to dig in.

88
00:05:34,881 --> 00:05:38,070
So I appreciate you taking the time.
Awesome. Yeah, me too. It's a, it's,

89
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:40,270
it's great to be here and,
uh,

90
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:45,340
thought we would start with some of the
backstory that I do not know and that is

91
00:05:46,161 --> 00:05:47,780
your childhood.

92
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:52,900
And perhaps you could just begin by
telling us how you would describe yourself

93
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:54,650
as a kid.
I mean,

94
00:05:54,651 --> 00:05:59,150
let's call it kind of three
to grade or anytime really.

95
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,860
What type of kid were you?

96
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,630
So yeah, going way back. Um,

97
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:09,640
well first I was,
uh,

98
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,930
I was definitely that kid
who is a on computers. So we,

99
00:06:13,931 --> 00:06:18,130
my parents, I remembered, uh, just like,

100
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,570
like titling into my living room and
seeing this glowing orb and all these

101
00:06:22,571 --> 00:06:26,490
buttons. And those were two things
I really liked when I was three. Um,

102
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:32,020
I guess still do. Um, and
um, so for sure I was,

103
00:06:32,021 --> 00:06:36,640
I was super interested in computers
and technology and started out by,

104
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:42,580
by playing computer or video
games. Basically. That was
like the first interest.

105
00:06:42,581 --> 00:06:45,620
And then I wanted to make
my own computer games. Um,

106
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:49,930
I thought that my career was going to be
starting a computer game company and I

107
00:06:49,931 --> 00:06:54,730
thought that was a, that there would
be nothing better than that. Um, and,

108
00:06:54,731 --> 00:06:57,520
uh, so I, but I, but I
was that kid, I'm sorry.

109
00:06:57,521 --> 00:07:02,110
I learned programming at an
early age. Um, I grew up in,

110
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:06,880
uh, just outside of Boston, so grew
up in New England. Um, and, uh,

111
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:12,310
and then on my way to MIT, I've really
liked math, science. Um, so, uh,

112
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:16,180
kind of out of central casting in terms
of being a computer science student. Um,

113
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:21,220
and then, yeah, and then, then I got,

114
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,500
my first career was babysitting,

115
00:07:23,501 --> 00:07:27,610
but then I discovered that you could be
paid to program and then that caused a

116
00:07:27,611 --> 00:07:31,480
bit of a career shift,
which we can talk about. Um,

117
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:36,150
uh, as much as I enjoyed the
babysitting lifestyle, you know,

118
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:39,880
you get like three bucks an hour,
I eat some Pringles watched the HBO,

119
00:07:39,881 --> 00:07:44,800
it's not that bad. Um, but, uh,
the program is even better anyway.

120
00:07:44,801 --> 00:07:49,190
So, um, so, uh, so, but in,

121
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:54,240
in middle school and in high school I
ended up getting a bunch of programming

122
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,680
internships or, or, or summer jobs, um,

123
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,430
at what worst our bed startups
basically. Um, one of the most remote,

124
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:08,440
most of them are local, but then that got
me on a path of starting companies and,

125
00:08:08,441 --> 00:08:12,850
and being involved in startups. But, um,
I would say those are probably the, um,

126
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,620
the biggest when it,
when it,

127
00:08:14,621 --> 00:08:18,310
when it comes to Dropbox and everything
that kind of followed after to from my

128
00:08:18,311 --> 00:08:21,610
childhood. It was a happy
childhood. Lots of, um,

129
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
uh, say it was still
pretty balanced. But I did,

130
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:31,840
I like programming and engineering
was for sure my first, my first love.

131
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,520
And were you a shy kid
and extroverted kid?

132
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,290
Played Sports, kind of kept to
yourself at recess? What was,

133
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:44,160
what would somebody looking in from
the outside? Like, how would your,

134
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,520
how would your third grade teacher
describe you in that capacity?

135
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:53,440
Yeah, I think somewhere in the middle.
So I, I wasn't, um, reclusive. Um,

136
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:58,590
I had a really group of friends. Um, I
wasn't captain of the soccer team either.

137
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:03,720
Um, I think I did, I did academic,
I did academic decathlon,

138
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:08,240
which is just a fascinating
thing that it exists.

139
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,460
Um, but you know, more of
a math leads then right.

140
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:17,700
Then an athlete to athlete.
So, um, but uh, and I was,

141
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:22,110
yeah,
it was not like a super social,

142
00:09:22,111 --> 00:09:26,400
but I had a good group of friends
and um, um, and then for sure it was,

143
00:09:26,401 --> 00:09:28,890
I went into college,
I became a lot more social and,

144
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,750
and just curious about humans
and human behavior. Um,

145
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:39,450
but, uh, but otherwise I think people
like I would have been known in class,

146
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:40,783
um,

147
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:44,210
as always doing it.
Like,

148
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:46,750
I think there were like those
superlatives and yearbooks.

149
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:51,340
I think I was like most likely to start
a company or it'd be like they pegged it

150
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:56,320
pretty early. Yeah. So I
was doing homework for this,

151
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:00,310
which I always enjoy doing
when it's someone I know, uh,

152
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:04,420
because I dig up all these bits and
pieces that I then want to fair it out and

153
00:10:04,421 --> 00:10:07,900
explore a bit.
So I came across this line,

154
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:12,300
the described folding chair
on top of fraternity, uh,

155
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:17,400
at MIT and that you would go up there
with piles of books and read these books.

156
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:22,830
So I don't like could you place us when
that was in your undergrad career and

157
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,660
how you chose the books and
why you did that? Yeah, so, so

158
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,710
I, it was about my junior
year of, uh, of, of Undergrad,

159
00:10:32,711 --> 00:10:37,711
I took a leave of absence because I had
an idea for a startup that I want it to

160
00:10:38,261 --> 00:10:41,680
pursue. Um, so I took a
year off to do that. Uh,

161
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:46,960
what I noticed was that the,
this was back in 2004, so the,

162
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,220
I was maybe 21 and the,
uh, sat was changing.

163
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:54,050
I started online sat
prep company and maybe,

164
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:58,990
and because what the opportunity was was
the sat was changing in 240 2005 from

165
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,090
1600 points to 2,400 points.

166
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:05,110
So suddenly all the course material
overnight was going to be obsolete.

167
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,920
And so I saw an opportunity
to maybe develop,

168
00:11:08,921 --> 00:11:11,350
not just a course for the
new sat but an online course.

169
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:14,560
And I teamed up with a former teacher
from my high school who had his own little

170
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:17,230
cottage sat prep company and I'm
like, Hey, if we come together,

171
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:21,820
we can put this thing online and we'll
be on an even playing field because, um,

172
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,211
you know,

173
00:11:22,211 --> 00:11:27,211
all those 800 page books that have been
printed about it are now a obsolete and

174
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:31,600
who really wants to go to some classroom
at eight in the morning on Saturday.

175
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:36,910
Um, anyway, like we can build a much
better experience if we do it online. So,

176
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,163
um,

177
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:43,720
I was really excited about starting a
company and we jumped into it and I think

178
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:45,790
we met in a Chili's and like we're

179
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,440
planning world domination
and like figuring out, okay,

180
00:11:50,441 --> 00:11:54,300
how do you incorporate a
company? And so it's really, um,

181
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,410
introduction to the world of
starting companies. And then, um,

182
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,360
it was, uh, it also,

183
00:12:01,361 --> 00:12:05,430
the more I learned about the mechanics of,

184
00:12:05,431 --> 00:12:10,270
of starting a company, the more I realized
I didn't know about business. Um, and I,

185
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:13,960
and I knew a lot about in engineering
and programming and, um, I had been,

186
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:18,990
I had worked at startups but when
it came to one w but it was kind of,

187
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,680
there was a fog beyond just like
building the product. And so I was like,

188
00:12:24,681 --> 00:12:29,500
all right, we're going to need, I know
like sales and marketing and strategy,

189
00:12:29,501 --> 00:12:33,620
like these are all things and all I know
is I don't know a lot about them. So, um,

190
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,700
I had the highly scientific method
of, I just was like, all right,

191
00:12:36,701 --> 00:12:37,870
I'm just gonna go on to Amazon,

192
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:42,930
type in sales by the top three or four
books and just do that for every like

193
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,710
category.
Um,

194
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:49,210
and then I had a couple of
book recommendations from
one of the founders of one

195
00:12:49,211 --> 00:12:52,500
of the companies where I worked
as well. But, uh, but it was,

196
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,990
it was great and it was, it was,
it was an important combination.

197
00:12:55,991 --> 00:12:58,270
So if one was one was actually starting,

198
00:12:58,271 --> 00:13:02,020
the company gave me motivation to really
learn this stuff because I think a lot

199
00:13:02,021 --> 00:13:04,990
of times when you're reading it can
just be like entertainment basically.

200
00:13:04,991 --> 00:13:07,510
It's like something where you just
like read the book, you'll like,

201
00:13:07,511 --> 00:13:08,141
that's interesting,

202
00:13:08,141 --> 00:13:12,670
but then don't use the knowledge
to actually starting a company.

203
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,380
Then you really have an excuse to
internalize and really study the material.

204
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,630
So there's a big difference between
reading the material and studying it.

205
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,170
Totally. But I was pretty
systematic about it and like, okay,

206
00:13:23,171 --> 00:13:27,250
here's all the stuff that
I don't know and, um,

207
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:32,950
and then is going to be a good way to get
me introduced to all these topics. Um,

208
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:37,840
and all of that. Maybe the first
instance of that was when, um,

209
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:41,980
you know,
I went through my high school and I was,

210
00:13:41,981 --> 00:13:45,220
and there were a lot of great books that
you read as part of your, um, you know,

211
00:13:45,221 --> 00:13:47,270
high school curriculum. But, um,

212
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,800
then I stumbled across the book
emotional intelligence by Daniel Goleman.

213
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:56,610
And I was like, oh my God. Like
this has just like, it's, I mean,

214
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:59,940
it's nonfiction. Um, but it, it,

215
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:02,020
it spelled out something that was,

216
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:05,740
I just didn't know you could kind
of break down in a logical way.

217
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:10,030
And suddenly I have this understanding
about the world that I didn't have before.

218
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:14,620
Um, and so that was
important because it sort of,

219
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:20,260
it was sort of one of a bunch of early
examples that anything is trainable.

220
00:14:20,261 --> 00:14:21,560
And, and, and it,

221
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:26,200
it got me on a path to developing what
we'd now call a growth mindset. Um,

222
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:30,070
and realizing that it's possible to learn
about these things that you were where

223
00:14:30,071 --> 00:14:31,810
you have no experience or
where it's easy to be like, oh,

224
00:14:31,811 --> 00:14:35,570
I don't know about that or I'm just an
engineer. I'm not a business person. Um,

225
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:37,900
and kind of shatter that misconception.

226
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:44,050
Do you think that you were open to all
of these different categories of learning

227
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:49,670
because of the necessity
vis-a-vis starting the company?

228
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:53,900
The reason I asked that is that,
uh, it's, it's not across the board,

229
00:14:53,901 --> 00:14:58,901
but some people with engineering
chops have seemed to have a learned or

230
00:14:59,961 --> 00:15:02,780
intrinsic disdain for sales marketing.

231
00:15:02,781 --> 00:15:06,980
This different bits and
pieces of businesses that are
a little softer, let's say,

232
00:15:06,981 --> 00:15:10,460
less quantifiable in some
respects. Uh, was it,

233
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:13,910
was it simply the motivation in building
this company where we had to write a,

234
00:15:13,911 --> 00:15:18,860
or rather wear all those hats that
kind of drove you into these different

235
00:15:18,861 --> 00:15:22,370
categories? Or where are you
intrinsically using that word quite a bit,

236
00:15:22,371 --> 00:15:26,900
but interested in learning more about
these different buckets through these

237
00:15:26,901 --> 00:15:27,734
different books?

238
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,810
Well,
I think it was a little of both.

239
00:15:30,811 --> 00:15:34,560
So certainly starting the company
made it a necessity and created a lot,

240
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,490
a lot of additional motivation.
But the experience,

241
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:43,470
I also found these other topics, uh, just
as interesting as, as the engineering.

242
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:48,030
Um, and I, and I think it's, yeah,
it's a big cultural when engineers, um,

243
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:53,060
start off by being dismissive or defensive
about that the technology is all that

244
00:15:53,131 --> 00:15:56,520
matters or if it doesn't have a
triple and a girl in Greek letters,

245
00:15:56,521 --> 00:15:57,390
it doesn't count.

246
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:02,190
Certainly was certainly like
a cultural meme at Mit. Um,

247
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:05,310
and I think it just creates a
huge blind spot for people, um,

248
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:08,280
both because it makes them less effective.
But it's also like, the stuff is,

249
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:11,170
is actually really interesting and,

250
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:14,880
but I kept having experiences like
that and the emotional intelligence,

251
00:16:14,881 --> 00:16:18,450
which is just one example,
but I took a class on negotiation and MIT,

252
00:16:18,451 --> 00:16:21,990
which sort of opened my eyes a notch
further on this kind of thing where I'm

253
00:16:21,991 --> 00:16:25,440
like, all right, negotiation. I go into
that class. I don't know a lot about it.

254
00:16:25,441 --> 00:16:28,950
I'm like, whoever like yells louder
lies more, smacks the table harder,

255
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,950
I guess that's what makes
you get negotiator. Um,

256
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:36,420
and then this class like, I mean
those are, those are tactics,

257
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,940
but like the class has these
frameworks where like, okay, it's more,

258
00:16:39,941 --> 00:16:44,430
people have thought about this and
they've broken it down. Um, and you,

259
00:16:44,431 --> 00:16:49,431
and it turns out that there's a whole
process of uncovering mutual interests and

260
00:16:50,821 --> 00:16:53,730
figuring out what your leverage
is and your best alternative
Dah, Dah, Dah. And so,

261
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,820
and, and spelling it out
in a way where I was like,

262
00:16:56,821 --> 00:17:01,110
actually this is a lot more straight
forward than some of the theoretical math

263
00:17:01,111 --> 00:17:03,560
classes I'm, I'm, I have to take. Um,

264
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:08,160
and it's a lot more applicable
to my daily life. And so,

265
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,290
um,
I started to,

266
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:14,700
I really appreciated like learning a
little bit about a lot of different

267
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:19,701
disciplines and in just putting up a
folding chair on my roof was the first

268
00:17:20,551 --> 00:17:22,930
thing that came to mind as far
as how I could actually do that.

269
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:28,460
Were there any other books besides
emotional intelligence during that period

270
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,390
that really had an impact on you?

271
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:35,320
Yes. So in that negotiation classes
book called getting to yes. Um,

272
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:38,830
which is about principle negotiation.
Um,

273
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:43,210
and I still think about a lot of those
I still think about and apply a lot of

274
00:17:43,211 --> 00:17:46,630
those concepts, um, today.
And then some of the,

275
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:50,910
so part of it was just like kind of
doing a random walk, Amazon. But, um,

276
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:55,710
I also became friends with the founders
of the companies where I worked. Um,

277
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:59,640
and I went during lunch breaks or at
other times I go like chase him down and

278
00:17:59,641 --> 00:18:02,730
bug them and ask them questions
about like, hey, how do
you start a company? Like,

279
00:18:02,731 --> 00:18:03,990
do you have any book recommendations?

280
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:09,350
I'm just making that kind of taking
advantage of being the bright eyed,

281
00:18:09,841 --> 00:18:12,340
bushy tailed intern,
um,

282
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:16,110
and shaking down my
boss or my mentor or my,

283
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:18,540
the founder or my mentors for,
for advice.

284
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:21,380
And so two of the books that
were really instrumental, uh,

285
00:18:21,381 --> 00:18:24,660
the first one is the innovator's
dilemma by Clay Christiansen. Um,

286
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:29,310
it's a book about how businesses
get disrupted and, um, and what,

287
00:18:29,311 --> 00:18:30,144
and it's a big part,

288
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:35,240
a lot of those themes or why startups can
succeed and thrive even when there are

289
00:18:35,851 --> 00:18:38,700
big competitors who you would
think would just wipe them out. Um,

290
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:42,120
and so how that cycle works. And there's
a book called crossing the Chasm,

291
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:45,600
which is another classic. Yeah, it's a
book on marketing, technology, marketing.

292
00:18:45,601 --> 00:18:46,560
It's like how did,
how do you,

293
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:51,930
how do technology products make their way
from early adopters to the mainstream?

294
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:55,830
And if you find yourself
revisiting those books,

295
00:18:55,860 --> 00:19:00,860
or were they a point in time during
that rooftop Amazon education period?

296
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,280
I have, I met, I'd say there are
a lot of, you read a lot of books.

297
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:13,370
Not all of them are as good as the
innovator's dilemma, but then yeah, it,

298
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,850
it also helps to revisit some of the
classics. Uh, innovator's dilemma is,

299
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,640
I've actually, both of those books
are good examples, so, so yeah,

300
00:19:20,641 --> 00:19:25,620
I do revisit them because again, when
you're 21 and you've never had a real job,

301
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,350
you know, you're, you're,

302
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:31,200
you're reading this book and you sort
of get a general sense for things,

303
00:19:31,201 --> 00:19:32,034
but you don't,

304
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:37,250
you don't really deeply understand the
concepts and then coming back five years

305
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:42,630
later, 10 years later, you can really
absorb a lot more of that material.

306
00:19:42,631 --> 00:19:47,580
So I do, I, I read a lot of books in
general and then when I'm reading a book,

307
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,730
I'll triage them like, okay, is
this something I need to study?

308
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:54,570
Is it something that's like interesting
or is it that I might need to know

309
00:19:54,571 --> 00:19:58,260
something about or is it just
fun? Um, and if you study it,

310
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,870
if I'm like,
I need to study this book,

311
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:04,500
then I approach it pretty differently
than if it's just like entertainment.

312
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,140
And for those people who
haven't read getting to, yes.

313
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:13,270
When you were leading into that with
some of the concepts from the class.

314
00:20:13,271 --> 00:20:13,991
I thought to myself,

315
00:20:13,991 --> 00:20:16,700
I bet that was part of the class or
one of the books you read because you,

316
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:21,780
you had best alternative and there's
a term I do recommend also people read

317
00:20:21,941 --> 00:20:25,900
getting to yes, Batna, best
alternative to negotiated agreement,

318
00:20:25,901 --> 00:20:28,030
which is a really
important concept to grasp.

319
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,790
And there's another book
that I recommend to people.

320
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:34,810
I think it was written later by one of
the coauthors of getting to yes called

321
00:20:34,811 --> 00:20:39,250
getting past to know and I think they
go together really, really nicely.

322
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:41,620
Uh,
if you were teaching,

323
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,860
say we're just going to stick on books
for a little bit because I know you read

324
00:20:44,861 --> 00:20:45,400
so much.

325
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:50,400
If you were teaching saying a freshmen
class or senior class Undergrad,

326
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:55,010
uh,
to,

327
00:20:55,970 --> 00:21:00,970
let's just say smart but non technical
people and you were assigning books to

328
00:21:01,601 --> 00:21:05,940
read, uh, and uh, they can be
part of the class or things,

329
00:21:05,941 --> 00:21:08,620
it could be read in advance.
If you were to pick,

330
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:10,420
I'm just pulling this out of thin air,

331
00:21:10,421 --> 00:21:15,421
but three to five books that would be
sort of the core of your reading list.

332
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,660
Uh, do any come to mind that we,
that we haven't talked about?

333
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:25,480
So for this,
for the sake of starting earth,

334
00:21:25,481 --> 00:21:29,410
if the subject of the class,
we're starting a company yeah. Um,

335
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:35,290
or evolving from being an engineer
to being a business person.

336
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,720
Um, I have a few, I have a handful of,

337
00:21:38,721 --> 00:21:42,430
of books that I really love
and the concepts I still,

338
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:46,090
that I use and think
about every day. So, um,

339
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:51,820
probably my two favorites are a high
output management by Andy Grove,

340
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:56,650
um,
which Andy Grove was the CEO of Intel,

341
00:21:56,651 --> 00:21:59,860
which was kind of the
Google of its time back, uh,

342
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:04,900
in the particular back in the
eighties and early nineties.

343
00:22:04,901 --> 00:22:07,690
So he,
Andy was an engineer,

344
00:22:07,691 --> 00:22:10,720
one of the founding engineers and then
rose the ranks at Intel and became CEO.

345
00:22:10,721 --> 00:22:12,320
So he, he's lived his path. And,

346
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:17,170
and when I read about that or I heard
about this book and it was introduced me

347
00:22:17,171 --> 00:22:19,840
as the best book on
management ever written. Um,

348
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:24,390
and I agree and it just breaks
down all the mechanics of um,

349
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:26,680
okay. How, how do you run a team?

350
00:22:26,681 --> 00:22:30,520
How do you break down a
goal and to into sub goals?

351
00:22:30,521 --> 00:22:34,000
How do you just the one on one
of, of, of, of running a team and,

352
00:22:34,001 --> 00:22:37,310
and running an organization
and a focus on, uh,

353
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,730
output and results and how do you
measure people? And just a lot,

354
00:22:39,731 --> 00:22:42,150
a lot of the things that you, nuts
and bolts, things that you, uh,

355
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:45,070
challenges that you encounter when
you're, when you're running a team. Um,

356
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:48,410
whether that's a company or
a team within a company. Um,

357
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:53,290
the second is the effective executive,
um, which does a great by Peter Drucker.

358
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:56,890
Um,
and the central

359
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:00,970
core of that book is really about people.

360
00:23:00,971 --> 00:23:05,500
It's very easy to mistake
a effort for effectiveness.

361
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:08,650
Um, there are a lot of different
phrases for this, like, you know,

362
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:13,420
it to confuse motion for progress or,
but, but it's really about that idea.

363
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:18,100
So how do you, um, how do you know if
you're being effective, what practices?

364
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:22,420
And then there's a bunch of practices
that you can adopt that, um,

365
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:27,160
that make you more effective and then
how do you avoid the sand traps of things

366
00:23:27,161 --> 00:23:30,220
that feel productive but aren't actually,
um,

367
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:35,020
and how do you deal dissects or how do
you unpack the case where we all have the

368
00:23:35,021 --> 00:23:36,040
same number of hours in a day,

369
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:41,041
but some of us seem to accomplish
a lot more than others.

370
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:44,800
The why is that and what
can you do instead? So the,
the effective executive is,

371
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:47,960
it covers a lot of that crowns that,
that's another,

372
00:23:47,961 --> 00:23:50,660
those two I think of is kind of like
textbooks. Like you want to study them,

373
00:23:50,661 --> 00:23:54,830
you want to take notes,
you want to really chew on the material.

374
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,870
Um, then I, I think there's others,

375
00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:00,470
there's a lot of other tactical
things about starting a company.

376
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,340
I'd say some more of the,
uh,

377
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:06,080
favorite book that's more about the
experience of running a company is Ben

378
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,180
Horowitz's book hard thing
about hard things, right?

379
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,770
Which is kind of just shows you kind of
a mess and adventure and the crazy highs

380
00:24:12,771 --> 00:24:13,820
and lows of,
of,

381
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:18,770
and like with the human experiences
of actually having to do this. Um,

382
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,910
and then I probably zoom out and
get a little more philosophical. Um,

383
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:24,680
so a couple of favorite books are,
um,

384
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,990
poor Charlie's Almanack by Charlie monger.

385
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:31,850
So Charlie Munger is Warren Buffett's
longtime business partner. Um, and um,

386
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,400
and one of the,

387
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:39,430
this book is really interesting because
one of the things about being a CEO or

388
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:42,190
taking on big responsibility,
um,

389
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,970
for anything is you have to make a lot
of decisions about a lot of different

390
00:24:46,971 --> 00:24:51,110
things and do it quickly and be right.
Um,

391
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,540
and so how do you be right
about tons of different things,

392
00:24:53,541 --> 00:24:55,970
especially if you don't have
a lot of life experience.

393
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:58,040
Like how do you train up
that scale quickly? I mean,

394
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:02,210
that's really called wisdom
or judgment. Um, and so the,

395
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:07,290
it says like, how do you, how do you
grow wisdom or grow judgment quickly? Um,

396
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:09,600
poor Charlie's Almanack is a,
is a great example of books.

397
00:25:09,601 --> 00:25:14,601
So it talks about how actually a lot of
what you need to know to be successful

398
00:25:14,751 --> 00:25:19,010
in life, conceptually, you learn it
in middle school or in high school,

399
00:25:19,011 --> 00:25:23,480
you just don't apply it or you don't
really internalize the concepts. Um,

400
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:29,170
and he argues that a lot of really
wise ineffective people develop or be

401
00:25:31,851 --> 00:25:35,330
basically build a catalog
of mental models, um,

402
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:38,240
where uh,
and concepts,

403
00:25:38,241 --> 00:25:41,700
whether that's something
from and basically assemble
all the best ideas from all

404
00:25:41,701 --> 00:25:44,810
the different disciplines and then
figure out how to apply them in life.

405
00:25:44,811 --> 00:25:47,760
And so for example, the concept of, um,

406
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:52,550
a Batna like in and leverage that that
might be a concept that can be applied in

407
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:56,720
all kinds of different situations or
comparative advantage from economics or,

408
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:01,640
and, uh, or you know, you
could, you could go on about,

409
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,010
um,
these different concepts,

410
00:26:04,011 --> 00:26:08,360
but then figuring out how
do you internalize them so
well that you're able to

411
00:26:08,361 --> 00:26:13,100
figure out, okay, these are what matters
in these situations. Um, and then,

412
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,520
uh, and then how do you avoid petty
particularly avoid terrible decisions.

413
00:26:16,521 --> 00:26:20,240
But really how do you build enough of it?
Get enough of these,

414
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,230
he calls it allowed us to work.

415
00:26:21,231 --> 00:26:24,350
How do you build them enough of a network
of these mental models so that you

416
00:26:24,351 --> 00:26:26,540
know which ones to apply when,
um,

417
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:29,690
and that you find yourself most of
the time being able to make good quick

418
00:26:29,691 --> 00:26:34,130
decisions. Um, and then I'm
also on the philosophical front.

419
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:38,690
Uh, so zen and the art of motorcycle
maintenance. Yeah. Appear sick. Yup.

420
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:40,220
Um,

421
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:45,220
so you talked about engineers who like
dismiss like all these things that can't

422
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:49,230
be fit into an algorithm
or uh, or, or you know,

423
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:54,360
that don't have some kind
of like mathematical rigor,
rigor underpinning them. Um,

424
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:58,420
zen in the art of motorcycle
maintenance is about that. Like that.

425
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,270
Just that question of okay,

426
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,790
you have like this whole rational world
which can explain a bunch of stuff,

427
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:05,490
but then you have the
whole aesthetic world,

428
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,670
which can't be boiled down to a formula.

429
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,940
And they both exist and they are
both useful in different cases,

430
00:27:11,941 --> 00:27:16,530
but they don't tend to get along. And so
how do you like, so what's up with that?

431
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:19,410
And then it's a really great book
about those kinds of concepts.

432
00:27:19,411 --> 00:27:23,190
And I think developing
an appreciation for,

433
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:28,980
for both are developing both your left
and right brain, you know, to, to,

434
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:33,360
to use that analogy I think
is really important if you're,

435
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,060
if you're running a team or,
or growing a company. Um,

436
00:27:36,061 --> 00:27:40,110
because there's a lot of stuff where
it's a lot about technique and data and,

437
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:43,160
and um,
and sort of like,

438
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:46,650
and a lot of things like
strategy or the engineering,

439
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:50,910
how are kind of fall into these if this,
then that kind of reasoning.

440
00:27:50,911 --> 00:27:55,911
But then a lot of the hard part of the
job is really about people and what

441
00:27:55,981 --> 00:27:58,260
motivates people. How do you, um,

442
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:01,470
paint a vision of the world
that's exciting for people?

443
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:04,490
How do you build good relationships?
Um,

444
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,940
how do you develop products with taste?
Uh,

445
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:12,150
those are things that are not going to
be where you're not able to reach as much

446
00:28:12,151 --> 00:28:16,580
into the, to the more rational or
in or like kind of engineering, um,

447
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:20,140
bag of tricks. So I think
developing both of those, um,

448
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,210
developing both sides of your brain are
developing an appreciation for for both

449
00:28:24,211 --> 00:28:27,660
is, is really valuable.
Um, maybe one more the,

450
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:32,310
so principles by Ray Dalio who was,
I know it was a recent guest.

451
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:36,580
Um, I think he's got just
really concise and good, um,

452
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:40,920
thoughts for like, all right. How
do you sort of approach all the,

453
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,240
um, how'd you approach life? So it's um,

454
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,630
I would include a mix of,
of of of different kinds of things.

455
00:28:48,631 --> 00:28:53,340
I'd have like more instructional books,
like more philosophical books.

456
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:56,010
Um,
more story in history kind of books.

457
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:00,670
Man. I don't want to take your class.
I'm like, yes, that's pretty good.

458
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:05,640
That was pretty good.
Number one. So consider me
preregistered or free preapplied.

459
00:29:05,641 --> 00:29:10,040
I want to make a couple of comments on
these books that you mentioned because uh,

460
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:14,360
I, I am very fond of all
of these books and I'll,

461
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:18,780
I'll just add a couple of,
of notes because they tie
together also really nicely.

462
00:29:18,781 --> 00:29:23,781
So high output management by Grove was
out of print at one point and then became

463
00:29:24,211 --> 00:29:29,211
so popular in Silicon Valley
that a new edition was printed.

464
00:29:29,311 --> 00:29:30,240
And the forward,

465
00:29:30,241 --> 00:29:35,160
I believe was from Ben Horowitz who
wrote the another book that you had

466
00:29:35,161 --> 00:29:39,120
mentioned. You know, the, what does it,
the hard thing about hard things, right?

467
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:44,110
And Ben Horowitz of Andreessen Horowitz
and many other things prior to that, uh,

468
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,610
to that book.

469
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:50,840
And there's of course a selection bias
here since I have a limited Dataset,

470
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:56,130
but the startups that I've been involved
with that have done best have kind of

471
00:29:58,271 --> 00:30:02,680
returned to the fund many, many, many
times over almost without exception,

472
00:30:02,681 --> 00:30:07,390
have all read high output management
and have a copy of it in their offices.

473
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,130
Uh,

474
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:12,490
th that's now I'm sure there are many
unsuccessful CEOs who also have that book,

475
00:30:12,491 --> 00:30:15,190
but nonetheless, uh,
the effective executive,

476
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:17,200
actually I'm gonna
leave that one for last.

477
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:21,620
So poor Charlie's Almanack is a great
book and I want to underscore something

478
00:30:21,621 --> 00:30:26,621
that you said a somewhat in passing or
which is really important and I know you,

479
00:30:26,891 --> 00:30:27,850
you know,
it's really important,

480
00:30:27,851 --> 00:30:32,470
which is the avoiding of
making really bad mistakes.

481
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:35,890
And one thing that monger
emphasizes a lot, you know,

482
00:30:35,891 --> 00:30:40,460
the right hand of Warren Buffet in Warren.
It I guess I said he has the fat,

483
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:44,650
the best 62nd mind he's ever met. And
I'm going to butcher this, I'm sure,

484
00:30:44,651 --> 00:30:47,140
but it's something that I think of a lot,
uh,

485
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:52,260
because I have some tendencies that are
unhelpful intro in shrine to be really

486
00:30:54,791 --> 00:30:58,930
smart and come up with clever solutions.
And I said, I revisit this quote,

487
00:30:58,931 --> 00:31:01,630
somebody could find the right version,
but it's monger who says, you know,

488
00:31:01,631 --> 00:31:06,631
it's amazing how successful you can become
if you just consistently avoid being

489
00:31:07,181 --> 00:31:11,920
stupid versus trying to
outsmart everybody else.

490
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:17,920
And I think a lot about that. Uh,
because it's so true. It's like God,

491
00:31:17,921 --> 00:31:22,780
yeah, if you just kind of watch your chips
and know your downside and don't make,

492
00:31:22,781 --> 00:31:26,650
you know, consistently make rational
decisions with these lattice works.

493
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:31,330
And these sharistics that you mentioned.
Super, super helpful, uh, and, uh,

494
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,400
the effective executive.
So the effective executive,

495
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:37,000
I want to come back to for a second.
And you mentioned nuts and bolts.

496
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:40,420
The effective executive,
I've read probably 10 or 12 times.

497
00:31:40,421 --> 00:31:43,870
I love this book and it's, it's
very short too. It's easy to read.

498
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,690
And you mentioned the
sort of nuts and bolts.

499
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,530
So I'm going to use this and then we'll
probably jump around chronologically,

500
00:31:50,531 --> 00:31:53,560
but you,
uh,

501
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:55,870
if I'm remembering correctly,

502
00:31:55,871 --> 00:32:00,280
have a label in your email called opp.

503
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:02,260
Uh,

504
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:06,910
could you explain for
people what this means?

505
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:12,890
Yes. So originally I think
originally, well, yeah, it was,

506
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:17,090
it stood for other people's problems.
Um,

507
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:20,240
although I made it a little nicer later.
Other people's priorities.

508
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:27,620
Um, and because I have a
vendetta against email,

509
00:32:27,621 --> 00:32:31,280
which we can, um, we can, we can dig into,

510
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:34,550
but I, I'm, I'm, I've had this experience,

511
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:38,270
I imagine anyone listening is that
this experience, like, all right,

512
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,070
you're inbox overflowing or

513
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:41,660
like,
I'm finally going to deal with this thing.

514
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:47,680
You plow through hundreds of emails
and your reward is more emails.

515
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:53,680
Right? Um, but, but then to the OPP
opp thing, I'm like, wait, what?

516
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:55,190
Then what are these things
like what am I doing?

517
00:32:55,191 --> 00:32:59,660
And then you realize that like you're
just basically checking off items on other

518
00:32:59,661 --> 00:33:03,500
people's to do list. Um, where there's,

519
00:33:03,501 --> 00:33:06,380
there's a sort of in the abstract,

520
00:33:06,381 --> 00:33:10,610
there's nothing wrong with that and it's
important to be helpful and we all have

521
00:33:10,611 --> 00:33:15,080
been helped by and help other people.
But, um, you can end up in a situation,

522
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,413
um,

523
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:21,520
where you're basically your to do list
is a composite of other people's to do

524
00:33:21,591 --> 00:33:26,591
list and your calendar and your
email can often reflect that and uh,

525
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:31,990
and tying it to another. So one of the
most important concepts is focus. Um,

526
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,390
everybody understands like,
yeah, yeah, focus. Um,

527
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:38,830
and I imagined something we'll
probably talk more about here. Um,

528
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:43,230
but there, there are so
many forces. It will,

529
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:45,680
some people love the idea of focus and,
and,

530
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:49,010
and when it was interesting just
going back to Warren Buffett,

531
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:52,500
so Warren Buffet and Bill Gates
did an interview. Um, it's on,

532
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,880
I think it's on Netflix. There's
like a Warren Buffet documentary, um,

533
00:33:55,970 --> 00:34:00,220
which is great. I also recommend,
but anyway, they, they, uh,

534
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:03,980
the interviewer ad, he was interviewing
both Warren and bill and was like,

535
00:34:03,981 --> 00:34:05,840
all right in a word,
what has made you most successful?

536
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,530
And they both at the same time,
it's like without missing a beat,

537
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:14,420
those said focus. Um, and so if we all,

538
00:34:14,421 --> 00:34:17,260
and it's like, seems so obvious
that we all know why focus is,

539
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:20,840
is like we don't need to be told why
focus is important. But then, uh,

540
00:34:20,841 --> 00:34:24,350
and one of the things that
the effective executive, uh,

541
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:25,790
highlights is that there's so many,

542
00:34:25,791 --> 00:34:29,850
like the default for pretty much
anything is to unfocus you. Um,

543
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:33,990
and that's true of your inbox, your
inbox, which is not prioritize.

544
00:34:33,991 --> 00:34:37,730
It's just kind of like you basically
get all these requests that are other

545
00:34:37,731 --> 00:34:42,200
people's priorities. Um, uh, if
you're working within an organization,

546
00:34:42,201 --> 00:34:46,250
pretty much everybody we'll be pulling
on you to kind of feed the beast of the

547
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:51,080
organization. And so it becomes very hard
to do a few things. Well. Um, and so,

548
00:34:51,081 --> 00:34:53,690
I mean there's a lot of great things
about that book, but, um, but yeah,

549
00:34:53,691 --> 00:34:55,220
I do have an opp folder,

550
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:59,750
which I try to keep it
manageable or find ways to,

551
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:05,180
um, I think that best is if you can
find ways to be helpful budgeting,

552
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:08,030
like involve other people
and actually helping.

553
00:35:08,031 --> 00:35:12,110
So I have a whole team of people
who can help me respond to, to,

554
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,210
to those,
those kinds of requests

555
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:19,280
sooner. The OPP folder, it's not this,
it's not necessarily a black hole. Uh,

556
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:22,810
it's not an indefinite
archive necessarily, but it's
when I'll get around to it.

557
00:35:22,811 --> 00:35:26,320
Do you have a set schedule for looking
in the OPP folder or having other people

558
00:35:26,321 --> 00:35:29,740
do that for you? And what are
the criteria? Right, if it,

559
00:35:29,741 --> 00:35:34,741
is it that anything that doesn't come
from say a direct report or an investor or

560
00:35:35,711 --> 00:35:40,711
a family member into opp or what are the,

561
00:35:40,951 --> 00:35:41,880
what are the guidelines?

562
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:47,190
Yeah, so the, I think some people
would say feeling call even when I'm,

563
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:51,980
when I help. So I'm not great at
responding to these things. So, I mean,

564
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:54,180
it might be, if it's something
that's like not a priority,

565
00:35:54,181 --> 00:35:59,040
then I'll try to respond
in days. But sometimes this
weeks, sometimes it's months,

566
00:35:59,041 --> 00:36:01,980
sometimes, sometimes I'll give you, you'll
get a response that's like, oh yeah,

567
00:36:01,981 --> 00:36:06,960
it's seven months later. It's like,
Oh, here is, you still need this. Um,

568
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:10,310
but, uh, so I, I would, I think it's, if,

569
00:36:10,311 --> 00:36:15,000
if it is something from a person
you have a relationship with, um,

570
00:36:15,001 --> 00:36:18,840
I would say [inaudible]
and there's probably other
factors, but it's like, okay,

571
00:36:18,841 --> 00:36:22,980
is this someone who,
uh, I know and where I,

572
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,430
where I personally would
be really helpful, um,

573
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:29,210
and they have done their
homework and it's like, well,

574
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:34,020
I think there's a certain first pass
filters like that. Um, I would say,

575
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:35,893
uh,

576
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,470
there is no commandment from God that
you have to respond to every email you

577
00:36:40,471 --> 00:36:43,310
receive. Um, so if,

578
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:45,820
if it's like a cold email cold
call or if it's like some,

579
00:36:45,821 --> 00:36:50,730
some someone I don't know,
or it's like a sales thing or whatever,

580
00:36:50,731 --> 00:36:55,440
I just, then it just goes into the black
hole. Um, or if it's something like,

581
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:58,950
you know, there's a lot of folks who
are like, Hey, I need, I need a mentor,

582
00:36:58,951 --> 00:37:03,660
or how do I raise money? Or you can
often tell by the question, like,

583
00:37:03,661 --> 00:37:04,494
as a person,

584
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:08,820
many if not most of the requests will
be something where the person could just

585
00:37:08,821 --> 00:37:11,700
do a little bit of homework
and get a good answer. Um,

586
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,810
and that's troubling because at first you
try to help people with those kinds of

587
00:37:15,811 --> 00:37:19,790
things. You're like, oh, well, you know,
go to this blog post or do this thing. Um,

588
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:23,940
and then you don't hear back from them
and it turns out they just never followed

589
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:25,140
up or just didn't do it.

590
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,980
And so after you get burned by spending
a bunch of time trying to be helpful to

591
00:37:28,981 --> 00:37:31,680
people who don't do their homework,
who don't help themselves,

592
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:36,480
you realize it's like not how you
want to spend your life. Um, so,

593
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:41,310
so you have to, you know, I think, I
don't think there's a magic formula, but,

594
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:44,520
but I think you want to just
keep what you want to do.

595
00:37:44,521 --> 00:37:48,340
Just keep that budget of you're time
constrained to something small. Yeah.

596
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:52,350
Or at least over small or big,
you should at least be mindful of it.

597
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:57,240
A lot of people just and find themselves
hopelessly busy and on this treadmill

598
00:37:57,241 --> 00:38:00,630
responding to other people's,
um, to do lists and,

599
00:38:00,631 --> 00:38:02,970
and knowing no one is doing
the things on their to do list.

600
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:08,530
Right. Yeah. One thing you said
about people doing their homework,

601
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:09,280
uh,

602
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:14,280
reminded me of this quote from Maria
Popova who writes brain pickings,

603
00:38:14,381 --> 00:38:15,670
which is this incredible site,

604
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:19,450
millions and millions of readers and
really long forms, smart writing.

605
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:23,260
And at some time I think she
changed it to be a little, uh,

606
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:28,690
more, uh, maybe sunny
seeming, but she had a quote,

607
00:38:28,691 --> 00:38:31,720
I'm pretty sure on her
Facebook page as the graphic,

608
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:33,820
as the header at one point that said,

609
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:38,740
if you haven't done or if someone hasn't
done the homework to determine, uh,

610
00:38:38,741 --> 00:38:40,150
whether it's a fit or not,

611
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,780
it doesn't warrant the energy to explain
why it isn't a fit or something like

612
00:38:43,781 --> 00:38:48,160
that,
which I think is a great commandment,

613
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:49,000
uh,

614
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:54,000
or sort of guideline to use because so
much of it when you reinforce that type

615
00:38:54,761 --> 00:38:57,820
of behavior by trying to be helpful,
they just come back.

616
00:38:57,850 --> 00:39:02,680
People tend to come back with equally
nebulous or unthought through questions.

617
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:03,820
Uh,

618
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:08,290
do you have any other best practices
or do's or do nots when it comes to,

619
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:13,420
to managing email? We're
not using email. Yeah.

620
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:18,360
Try not to use a lot of email.
Um, because often if it's,

621
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:23,110
um, I think emails for is good
for quick discrete tasks, um,

622
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:26,920
where you're holding someone up by not
doing them. But if you're trying to,

623
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,360
uh, and then I think it's also
useful to like for broadcasts,

624
00:39:31,361 --> 00:39:35,000
like if you have something, if you
have some long form written, um,

625
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:39,240
direction that you want to give
a group of people, um, then then,

626
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:41,110
then that's a good use of it.
Um,

627
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:44,710
but often when people get into
these long email threads, uh,

628
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:47,890
it's often,
uh,

629
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:52,300
it's sometimes we fun and indulgent
to get into these big like flame wars.

630
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:57,610
But often the best way to if,
if, if you get along email,

631
00:39:57,611 --> 00:40:00,690
often the best response is to
talk to them in person. Um,

632
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,070
and if you're getting a
lot of little requests,

633
00:40:03,071 --> 00:40:06,730
it's better to just batch them up and
have some kind of weekly cadence where you

634
00:40:06,731 --> 00:40:11,260
can deal with a lot of quick
requests without having the
overhead of, uh, of, um,

635
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:13,980
uh, of email. And I think that this is,

636
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:17,350
these are all kind of email is just one
example of a lot of different forces

637
00:40:17,351 --> 00:40:22,310
that can take away that can kind
of shatter your attention, um,

638
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:25,090
or take away your time.
Um, I think one of the,

639
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:27,970
one of the most valuable concepts
from the effective executive is,

640
00:40:27,971 --> 00:40:31,820
is measuring your time and early
understanding where your time goes. Um,

641
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:35,650
and it is kind of shocking and Hilarious,

642
00:40:35,651 --> 00:40:40,390
but really tragic that we all think
we know exactly where our time goes.

643
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:42,910
Um,
but then when you measure it,

644
00:40:42,911 --> 00:40:46,300
you're not usually just like slightly
wrong and you're like totally upside down.

645
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:49,000
Um, so, um,

646
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:53,860
this is a really valuable exercise for
anyone but actually like keeping a log of

647
00:40:53,861 --> 00:40:57,910
like where you spend your
time, um, and categorizing it.

648
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,970
I remember the first time I did this,
did this, I was like, all right,

649
00:41:00,971 --> 00:41:04,270
I'm running a company. It's things
are going well. I probably what,

650
00:41:04,271 --> 00:41:06,730
what do I spend my time on? Oh,
back then it was PR. I was like,

651
00:41:06,731 --> 00:41:10,600
I want to spend my time on the product
and recruiting and Dah, Dah, Dah. Um,

652
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:14,380
and when I actually did
the, the, the inventory, um,

653
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:18,060
like I was spending like no time
on those things. I was spending a,

654
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:21,730
there was a lot of, yeah, a
lot of opp back then. Like,

655
00:41:21,731 --> 00:41:23,350
just like responding to fit,

656
00:41:23,351 --> 00:41:26,800
like following up on favors or speaking
engagements that didn't really do

657
00:41:26,801 --> 00:41:29,830
anything for the company.
And there wasn't like a lot of tea,

658
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:33,740
like total fat like that.
But um,

659
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:38,750
but it just might [inaudible] what you
find is you write down your priorities

660
00:41:38,751 --> 00:41:41,510
and you look at your time and you find
that things are totally mismatched.

661
00:41:41,511 --> 00:41:46,430
And so any mechanism you can, uh, to,

662
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:51,460
um, to first understand where your time
goes and then make sure your priorities

663
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:53,030
actually match it.
I think at the end of the day,

664
00:41:53,031 --> 00:41:57,080
that's conceptually what you want to
do a and then just understand that,

665
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:01,300
um, you're going to attend and
then you also want to offset the,

666
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:06,200
the tendency for to be in this
permanently. We reactive state.

667
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:07,010
Um,
which,

668
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:09,590
whether that's cause you're getting
emails that are other people's requests or

669
00:42:09,591 --> 00:42:14,540
your calendar says one
thing. Um, usually when you,

670
00:42:14,541 --> 00:42:16,730
your to do list gets too long.
You just try to,

671
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:20,330
you just sort of do things randomly
or just do whatever the last thing,

672
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:23,540
you're just respond to whatever showed
up most recently in her inbox or what

673
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:27,860
blinked at you or what yelled
at you loudest in the last hour.

674
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:32,840
Um, and that's not a, that's not
effective. Um, compared to having,

675
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:36,950
setting your own priorities and
measuring yourself against them. Um,

676
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:39,440
and this is separate topic,

677
00:42:39,441 --> 00:42:43,370
but I think technology needs to do a
lot better job of helping us do that

678
00:42:43,371 --> 00:42:44,540
because it's really hard.
And then,

679
00:42:44,541 --> 00:42:48,740
especially as you're in any kind
of organization, um, you're gonna,

680
00:42:48,741 --> 00:42:52,320
you're gonna the, the, the, the fires
will get dealt with first and that's,

681
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:55,950
that's not a bad thing. Um, or
that, that's like necessary.

682
00:42:55,951 --> 00:43:00,140
You can't not put out the fires,
but then the important stuff, the,

683
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:04,220
I'd say Eisenhower had this
work versus virgin. Yeah.

684
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:05,840
The matrix that are the quadrants,

685
00:43:05,841 --> 00:43:10,260
I guess it was the two by two
is an important and urgent and,

686
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:13,340
um, eliminating stuff that's
not important. Not Urgent, but,

687
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:16,970
but really the biggest prior crisis of
prioritization is like how do you make

688
00:43:16,971 --> 00:43:20,630
sure that you do, um,
that you elbow out time,

689
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:25,610
the important not urgent stuff because
the important and urgent stuff will get

690
00:43:25,611 --> 00:43:26,444
taken care of.

691
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:30,950
But then you end up with a lot of
stuff that's not important or urgent,

692
00:43:30,951 --> 00:43:32,930
not important or not important,
not urgent.

693
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:37,310
And you really want to cut those down
as much as possible because otherwise a

694
00:43:37,311 --> 00:43:39,950
lot of the fires,
if you actually do root cause analysis,

695
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:40,731
I think about like why did,

696
00:43:40,731 --> 00:43:44,900
why was this fire in the first place when
you kind of climb that ladder a couple

697
00:43:44,901 --> 00:43:46,580
of rungs?
Like why did this happen,

698
00:43:46,581 --> 00:43:49,520
why this happened or why it happened
cause that well, why did that happen?

699
00:43:49,521 --> 00:43:50,960
Because of that.
Um,

700
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:55,160
you find that just a little
bit of planning would have,

701
00:43:55,700 --> 00:44:00,110
would have eliminated the need to
fight that fire. Um, and so, but it,

702
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:02,990
and it's really easy to spend your days
kind of doing the equivalent of paying,

703
00:44:02,991 --> 00:44:06,800
paying down a lot of like high interest
credit card debt with your time by just

704
00:44:06,801 --> 00:44:11,060
doing, fighting all these fires and not
actually putting them out at their root.

705
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:15,770
Um, so something I do on that
front now is I, I've, uh, uh,

706
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,420
there's a concept called
no meeting Wednesday,

707
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:21,290
which I think is popular around the
valley and maybe it originated Facebook,

708
00:44:21,291 --> 00:44:21,801
I'm not sure,

709
00:44:21,801 --> 00:44:26,510
but we've sort of Ha halfheartedly
adopted that and I half heartedly adopted

710
00:44:26,511 --> 00:44:30,800
that for awhile. But I
remember there was a, I'm like,

711
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:33,300
I really want to do this because there's
all this planning and like all these

712
00:44:33,301 --> 00:44:37,680
things that are important that that
where the cost of me not creating clarity

713
00:44:37,681 --> 00:44:39,670
for my team is super high.
Um,

714
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:44,600
and I sat down with my assistant at the
time and I was like, Hey, I need to like,

715
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,990
please don't schedule stuff on
Wednesday. Like, it's really, uh,

716
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:50,020
it's really important that I work on
this particular project and, you know,

717
00:44:50,110 --> 00:44:51,930
it's just not going to get
done unless there's some,

718
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:55,680
unless I have like a full day or like
many hours of uninterrupted time.

719
00:44:56,370 --> 00:44:58,850
And she's like, but she's
like, but blah, blah,

720
00:44:58,851 --> 00:45:00,690
blah has this and it's important and blah,
blah,

721
00:45:00,691 --> 00:45:03,660
blah has this and it's important and blah,
blah, blah has this and it's important.

722
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:04,973
And I'm like,

723
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:09,870
there will never be a day where there
isn't something quote important, you know,

724
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:14,430
coming up. Um, and so, uh, it, it's dawned
on me in that conversation, but I'm like,

725
00:45:14,431 --> 00:45:19,290
this shit, this is all important.
Like, eh, but it's not in.

726
00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:23,940
And so, um, I was like, look, just,

727
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:28,950
I really want it. If, if, if it is
important, just schedule it on Saturday,

728
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:31,650
I'll come into the office,
I'll do all those things.

729
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,140
And then miraculously,

730
00:45:34,141 --> 00:45:38,640
those things kind of ended
up doing themselves and
adopting no meeting Wednesday

731
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:42,120
was utterly transformative in terms of,

732
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:45,780
of actually being able to think and make
progress on the most important thing.

733
00:45:45,781 --> 00:45:46,501
Because otherwise you just,

734
00:45:46,501 --> 00:45:49,290
you lift up your head and you finally
six months have passed on some important

735
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:52,710
on quote important priority of
yours and there's been no progress.

736
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:56,970
So thinking about how to develop
systems and how do you build in time for

737
00:45:56,971 --> 00:46:01,080
reflection and an elbow
at the time, um, for,

738
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:03,350
for you to think and set direction.
I think that's,

739
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,790
that's probably one that's one of the
biggest mistakes that people make.

740
00:46:05,791 --> 00:46:08,790
And one of the concepts from effective
executive is like a lot of that stuff

741
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:10,630
only makes pro,
that doesn't,

742
00:46:10,631 --> 00:46:15,420
that that stuff doesn't make progress
with a half hour slot in a meeting of 10

743
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:18,240
or an a day of 10 hours of
half hour meetings like you,

744
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:23,460
there's a minimum quantum of time for
deep thought or deep work that you need.

745
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:27,180
Um, and so anyway, there's a
lot of really conceptual found,

746
00:46:27,181 --> 00:46:30,330
a great conceptual foundations and
effective executive about your time and

747
00:46:30,331 --> 00:46:32,250
effectiveness and disability,

748
00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:36,500
waiting buisiness from effectiveness
and then the concept of leverage in high

749
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:39,900
upper management, um, and a
focus on output. So those,

750
00:46:39,901 --> 00:46:42,750
those two books have pretty much
conceptually everything you need.

751
00:46:42,751 --> 00:46:45,390
But then implementing it in
practice is a lot harder.

752
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:49,910
Yeah. We're, we're going to talk about
the practice all, all quite a bit.

753
00:46:49,911 --> 00:46:51,440
I think also in this conversation,

754
00:46:51,441 --> 00:46:55,580
I want to circle back to a few things
you mentioned because I think they're

755
00:46:55,581 --> 00:46:57,620
really important. Uh, the,

756
00:46:57,621 --> 00:47:01,580
the first is the Eisenhower Matrix.

757
00:47:01,581 --> 00:47:04,420
I think it might be
referred to as, uh, which,

758
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:07,610
which people can look up
on their own time. But the,

759
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:10,100
the correlating in some respects,

760
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:15,130
maybe exercise that I think Drucker brings
up and the effective executive is the

761
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:21,290
jar or a mason jar. And if people
can visualize this very easily,

762
00:47:21,291 --> 00:47:23,750
but if you have a mason jar
and next to the Mason Jar,

763
00:47:23,751 --> 00:47:27,410
you have a handful of large
rocks that can fit into the jar.

764
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:31,270
Then you have a bunch of smaller pebbles
and then you have a pile of sand,

765
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:33,250
all of which has come out of the jar.

766
00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:36,640
If you put in the big rocks first,

767
00:47:36,670 --> 00:47:41,590
I your sort of most critical tasks,
which may or may not be urgent,

768
00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:44,470
then you can fit in the pebbles and
then you can fit it in the sand.

769
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:46,090
And you scroll on the top
and it's nice and neat,

770
00:47:46,091 --> 00:47:49,910
but if you put it in the sand first, the
whole thing falls apart, right? You, you,

771
00:47:49,911 --> 00:47:50,210
you,

772
00:47:50,210 --> 00:47:55,210
you cannot take the same volume of rocks
and pebbles and sand and get it into

773
00:47:56,441 --> 00:48:00,510
the jar and a which,
which visually, uh, from,

774
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:05,520
from an imagery standpoint, it is
very easy to understand. And, and, uh,

775
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:08,920
the,
the time audit though as you described,

776
00:48:08,921 --> 00:48:13,690
is so important for people to do because
very often even your calendar is not a

777
00:48:13,691 --> 00:48:17,970
good reflection of how you in
fact spend your time. And, uh,

778
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:23,070
if you look at say self
reporting in dietary studies
where they're observational

779
00:48:23,891 --> 00:48:27,280
and people are going home and then coming
back and reporting every two weeks or

780
00:48:27,281 --> 00:48:28,760
something like that.
If you,

781
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:31,090
if you ask people to estimate
their caloric consumption,

782
00:48:31,091 --> 00:48:35,440
it's almost always like 30 to 40% off,

783
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,340
right? It's not a small difference. And
I think the same thing happens with time.

784
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,240
Uh, really, really routinely. Um, the,

785
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:48,160
the blocks of time, actually,
you know what I'm going to get,

786
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:50,560
I'm going to make a reading recommendation
and then I'm going to come back to

787
00:48:50,561 --> 00:48:52,480
this name, which of course you're
going to be very familiar with,

788
00:48:52,481 --> 00:48:56,350
but for people who really want to also
get a teaser for what you'll read more

789
00:48:56,351 --> 00:48:59,020
about and the effective executive and
there's an essay, I might be getting it,

790
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:02,830
the headline slightly off, but you'll
be able to find it. Maker's schedule,

791
00:49:02,831 --> 00:49:07,300
manager's schedule. Yep. Bye.
Bye. Paul Graham. And uh,

792
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:11,830
the legendary PG who are going to come
back to a, is a good place to start.

793
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:16,990
But I want to rewind the
clock for a second and ask
you why did you stop the sat

794
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:18,640
on my prep company?

795
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:21,640
So,
uh,

796
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:26,910
I started the sat prep company
in 2004 and then I, uh,

797
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:31,750
went back to school, finished my undergrad
and then a couple of things happen.

798
00:49:31,751 --> 00:49:35,890
So I was still, I was, after graduation
I started working as an engineer at a,

799
00:49:35,891 --> 00:49:38,350
a network security company.
Um,

800
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:42,490
and I was still moonlighting on the
s on Accolade, the sat prep company.

801
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,590
Um, but I found myself in a
situation where it was like,

802
00:49:47,591 --> 00:49:52,420
it was just like harder and harder to
make progress on the sat prep company and

803
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:57,780
I wasn't really sure what was going on
because I just felt like it was just,

804
00:49:59,981 --> 00:50:04,690
it took more and more willpower
to like pedal, uh, or I felt like,

805
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,810
I don't know whether it was because I
felt like I was peddling harder but not

806
00:50:07,811 --> 00:50:09,610
getting anywhere or one way
or another, it just, it.

807
00:50:09,611 --> 00:50:12,280
But over time it took a lot
more willpower to work on it.

808
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:16,600
And so I found myself procrastinating
with all these like side projects

809
00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:23,570
and I mean now I recognize all
of this as burnout. Um, and,

810
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:28,700
and, and a positive. Uh, there aren't
a lot of good things about burnout,

811
00:50:28,701 --> 00:50:29,880
but sometimes it can steer.

812
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:33,020
The positive element is consider your
attention to things that are more

813
00:50:33,021 --> 00:50:36,950
worthwhile. Um, but then I was
worried cause I'm like, Oh my God,

814
00:50:36,951 --> 00:50:41,540
I'm like so unproductive and I'm
getting a wallowing in this like guilt.

815
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:46,090
Um, I was raised Catholic, so like this
Catholic guilt of like not, you know,

816
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:49,350
I'm not working hard enough. This company
is not successful enough. All my Dah,

817
00:50:49,351 --> 00:50:54,030
Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah. And it's
like totally not helpful. Um,

818
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:56,300
but, and so I'm like,
oh my God, am I broken?

819
00:50:56,301 --> 00:50:59,840
Like I might not capable of working
hard, what's wrong with me? Um,

820
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:02,030
but then I would like,
well one good news,

821
00:51:02,031 --> 00:51:03,980
I started working on this like poker Bot

822
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:07,850
that started and it
played with real money.

823
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:11,780
Like I like got past the security
on the poker client. This is six.

824
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:15,680
So I figured out how to like make all
that work and then watch kind of my

825
00:51:15,681 --> 00:51:20,681
Frankenstein moment as the Bot comes to
life and starts playing on real poker

826
00:51:22,461 --> 00:51:26,600
tables. And so this idea that you can have
poker bots was like totally false. Um,

827
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:31,080
but, and, and but I was possessed.
It was like kind of thing.

828
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:34,320
Was the WISC Frankenstein's monster
wedding? Well, I mean frank is,

829
00:51:34,510 --> 00:51:38,510
the Frankenstein was like, not too,
not too smart in the beginning.

830
00:51:38,511 --> 00:51:40,340
So like there's some [inaudible] it,

831
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:43,240
that's the thing starts moving
the mouse and playing cards,

832
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:46,760
playing the hand then gets
confused because it had,

833
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:51,050
there's some like obscure multiple split
pot or something that I just didn't

834
00:51:51,051 --> 00:51:52,610
write the code to handle that situation.

835
00:51:52,611 --> 00:51:55,220
So the thing crashes and folds your
aces and you're like, okay, awesome.

836
00:51:55,221 --> 00:51:56,390
This is what AI looks like.

837
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:05,870
But it was scaring my
family because I was,

838
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:09,290
I was living in Boston but then we have
a little summer place in New Hampshire

839
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:14,150
and I was like, my family is like,
okay, you can come up this weekend,

840
00:52:14,870 --> 00:52:17,480
we're all going to be at the
lake. And I'm like, okay.

841
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:21,730
And then I get to the lake and I'm start
unpacking my trunk and I've had like

842
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:24,320
three monitors and like all
these computers and I'm like,

843
00:52:25,170 --> 00:52:26,650
I mean this is like a
little cottage on upon,

844
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,910
it's not set up to be
like mission control.

845
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:33,940
So I'm like putting monitors on
the stove and my parents are like,

846
00:52:35,061 --> 00:52:39,350
what are you doing? They're kind of used
to me having all these side projects.

847
00:52:39,351 --> 00:52:41,540
So they're just like, I
hope it's not illegal. Just,

848
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:48,150
um, unfortunately that side project had
to stop because of that, like the potent,

849
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:51,770
in fall of 2006, it became like, went
from like kind of borderline too,

850
00:52:51,771 --> 00:52:55,050
like very illegal to do
online poker so that, um,

851
00:52:56,120 --> 00:53:00,640
that project ended. But, um, but,
but so what's that about? Uh,

852
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:03,530
what I took from that was like,
well, first I'm like, I'm not broken.

853
00:53:03,730 --> 00:53:05,420
I'm super capable of working hard.
It's just like,

854
00:53:05,421 --> 00:53:09,830
I need to find something that
I'm really, I'm motivated by. Um,

855
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:14,960
and so that was a
relief. And then, um, uh,

856
00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:19,520
and then along the way, so I, I
continued to work on the sat prep thing,

857
00:53:19,521 --> 00:53:23,900
but then the kind of the founding
story of Dropbox was, um,

858
00:53:23,930 --> 00:53:26,710
well I had to use,
well,

859
00:53:26,830 --> 00:53:29,370
the founding sort of striped Dropbox
starts with forgetting my thumb drive and

860
00:53:29,371 --> 00:53:34,160
going on the Chinatown bus, which I'll
get to. But, um, but before that I was,

861
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:38,310
I kept having these problems working
with my cofounder because, um,

862
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:40,320
are collaborating with them because
we didn't have an office. Well,

863
00:53:40,321 --> 00:53:41,430
we bootstrapped the company,

864
00:53:41,431 --> 00:53:45,450
so we didn't raise any money
and we didn't have an office.

865
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:48,000
We didn't work out at the same
place and we didn't have servers,

866
00:53:48,001 --> 00:53:51,300
we didn't have anything. So we would
just like email stuff back and forth. Um,

867
00:53:51,410 --> 00:53:52,980
and I had to work on multiple computers,

868
00:53:52,981 --> 00:53:57,981
so I kept carrying around this thumb
drive and having these elaborate scripts

869
00:53:59,041 --> 00:54:02,160
that would back up are
the sat prep company,

870
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:05,520
kind of all of our files to a server.

871
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:11,940
And then eventually I was like,
all right, well I want to, I,

872
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:15,000
I had graduated from
college is about 2006,

873
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:19,800
late 2006 a lot of my friends had
lived in New York and they were like,

874
00:54:19,801 --> 00:54:21,920
you gotta come out. It's a
lot of fun here, you know,

875
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:25,170
just come out for the weekend. And I'm,
I have a dilemma because I'm like, well,

876
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:28,530
I need to get some stuff
done for my company,

877
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:30,960
but I also want to go to New York.
And I'm like,

878
00:54:30,961 --> 00:54:35,580
maybe if I take the Chinatown
bus, uh, or if I ride the bus,

879
00:54:35,581 --> 00:54:39,180
I can get, I can have four
and a half hours each way.
So then I'll have 10 hours.

880
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:42,600
10 hours should be enough time to do
what I need to do is, you know, you know,

881
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:46,140
the alert, elaborate rationalizations we
we come up with and so I'm like, okay,

882
00:54:46,141 --> 00:54:49,320
I will fail if I take the bus. That's,
I'm, I'm greenlight to go to New York.

883
00:54:50,070 --> 00:54:52,050
Then I get on the bus and
I've forgotten my thumb drive.

884
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:58,590
So and then crack problem. Yeah. Yeah.

885
00:54:58,780 --> 00:55:03,150
Back to self flagellation I'm like, oh,
I can't, I'm like, I keep doing this.

886
00:55:03,151 --> 00:55:07,730
I suck. You know, I'm not like I hate
my thumb drive. I'm like, I hate me. Um,

887
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:12,570
um, but I'm like, oh my God, I just
cannot deal with this problem. I'm like,

888
00:55:12,571 --> 00:55:15,740
I know this is so stupid.
Like I'm so sick of like email,

889
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:17,490
like emailing myself a file.

890
00:55:17,590 --> 00:55:20,580
Like what is the question for
which there is no question for us.

891
00:55:20,590 --> 00:55:21,391
That's the right answer.
I'm like,

892
00:55:21,391 --> 00:55:25,560
what did you think of the
physical equivalent of that?
Like taking an envelope,

893
00:55:25,561 --> 00:55:26,251
putting something in it,

894
00:55:26,251 --> 00:55:29,100
putting your own name in the to and from
putting it in the mailbox and getting

895
00:55:29,101 --> 00:55:34,050
it back. I'm like, this is what we
do to like manage our files. Um,

896
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:37,020
uh, that carry on a thumb drive. All
the things we used to have to do.

897
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:38,310
And I'm like,
I never want to have this problem again.

898
00:55:39,810 --> 00:55:43,020
So I on the bus,
um,

899
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:48,060
I open up the editor and started writing
some code in python that basically was

900
00:55:48,061 --> 00:55:50,310
the seed that sprouted into Dropbox,

901
00:55:50,311 --> 00:55:55,080
but it's weird and I was just like
totally possessed with that problem. Um,

902
00:55:55,620 --> 00:56:00,080
because I'm an engineer, I'm
an engineer by upbringing. Um,

903
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:03,030
my favorite classes at school other than
some of the stuff we've talked about

904
00:56:03,031 --> 00:56:07,350
was, or like algorithms,
distributed systems, um, you know,

905
00:56:07,351 --> 00:56:09,270
and I found myself at a
crossroads where I'm like, look,

906
00:56:09,271 --> 00:56:13,890
I love standardized tests as
much as any human possibly can,

907
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:18,210
I guess.
But it was a couple of things happen.

908
00:56:18,211 --> 00:56:21,990
So one is I like pause. I'm like,
okay, I'm working on this company.

909
00:56:23,230 --> 00:56:25,690
I'm kind of burning out.
Um,

910
00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:28,930
part of why is because I
thought about it like, okay,

911
00:56:28,931 --> 00:56:33,310
even if all of my dreams come through
and like everything we hope for happens

912
00:56:33,311 --> 00:56:37,740
with this sat prep company,
then I'm like, then what?

913
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:41,320
Then then what? And I'm like,
I'm like King of sat prep.

914
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:44,320
Right?
And there's nothing,

915
00:56:44,321 --> 00:56:47,920
I mean I think that's fine and like
people need help with these things,

916
00:56:48,310 --> 00:56:51,310
but I'm like,
that's not what I want to do.

917
00:56:51,311 --> 00:56:53,590
I'm just picturing this kind
of like cardboard crown.

918
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:58,220
And I'm like, and that's only
if everything goes well. Oh,

919
00:56:58,240 --> 00:56:59,950
that's like if all of our
dreams come true. So I'm like,

920
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,450
I need to do something else.
Um,

921
00:57:02,530 --> 00:57:06,280
and so I ended up with these side projects
and then found myself getting totally

922
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:11,530
obsessed with a first to poker Bot,
but then even more so with Dropbox.

923
00:57:11,650 --> 00:57:16,180
And so sometimes it's hard it, you
know, like how do you deal with burnout?

924
00:57:16,181 --> 00:57:17,380
How do you know if you're
doing the right thing? And,

925
00:57:17,381 --> 00:57:20,050
cause these are really hard questions.
I mean for me sort of listening,

926
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:22,150
sometimes a lot of
procrastination is unhealthy,

927
00:57:22,151 --> 00:57:26,470
but sometimes that little voice is
leading you in a much better direction.

928
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:33,100
So I want to serve, I want to
bring this back to the dot, dot,

929
00:57:33,101 --> 00:57:35,820
dot that I left after Paul Graham.
Uh,

930
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:39,070
and we can certainly go in any
possible direction you want to take it.

931
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:42,780
But for people who don't know,
Paul Graham, maybe you could,

932
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:47,820
maybe you could describe Paul Graham's
certainly as close to a Demi God as one

933
00:57:48,011 --> 00:57:50,710
can probably get among many,

934
00:57:50,711 --> 00:57:55,030
many young entrepreneurs and older
entrepreneurs in silicon valley.

935
00:57:55,630 --> 00:57:58,990
Who is Paul Graham?
What is y Combinator?

936
00:57:59,290 --> 00:58:03,400
And can you describe your
first meeting with Paul Graham?

937
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:09,040
Yes. Um, so Paul Graham
is best known as the, uh,

938
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:13,140
is one of the founders of y Combinator.
So they are,

939
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:14,940
which is an incubator for startups.
They've,

940
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:19,860
and they were our first investors and
they also invested in a lot of great

941
00:58:20,310 --> 00:58:24,840
companies, including, um, Airbnb,
stripe, uh, a lot of them.

942
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:29,730
And, uh, Paul was before
starting my Combinator,

943
00:58:29,731 --> 00:58:32,370
he had written, uh, he, he
was an entrepreneur himself,

944
00:58:32,371 --> 00:58:37,371
so he started coming home via web back
in the.com or the the first.com boom and

945
00:58:38,521 --> 00:58:39,240
sold it.

946
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:44,240
And then he had a lot of
really provocative and
insightful essays on startups

947
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:48,600
that gained a big following.
Um,

948
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:52,890
and he was also one of
the creators, um, um,

949
00:58:52,891 --> 00:58:55,250
or at least was very early in
the conversation around, uh,

950
00:58:55,260 --> 00:59:00,260
using a Bayesian methods using this
kind of math to do spam filtering.

951
00:59:00,421 --> 00:59:05,340
So he's also one of the originals are one
of the architects or at least involved

952
00:59:05,341 --> 00:59:09,010
in that community of people who have
figured out how to get rid of spam. Um,

953
00:59:09,090 --> 00:59:10,770
and that's actually how
I first heard about him,

954
00:59:10,771 --> 00:59:15,000
but then he started writing about
startups and then ran this experiment that

955
00:59:15,001 --> 00:59:16,640
became my Combinator.
Um,

956
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:19,410
but it was actually called the summer
founders program when I was digging

957
00:59:19,411 --> 00:59:23,960
through some old email it because, um, I,

958
00:59:23,990 --> 00:59:26,750
this was the precursor to y Combinator.
Uh,

959
00:59:26,810 --> 00:59:31,160
I applied with my sat prep
company to that and was rejected.

960
00:59:31,550 --> 00:59:36,440
Um, but then managed to get
into y Combinator a couple
of years later. So, um,

961
00:59:36,530 --> 00:59:40,910
so I guess the first virtual meeting
of applying to be funded, uh,

962
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:44,960
didn't go well. Um, the first in person
meeting was probably, oh wait, hold on,

963
00:59:44,990 --> 00:59:48,290
hold on, pause. Why didn't, why didn't
the virtual meeting go well? Well,

964
00:59:48,291 --> 00:59:49,820
we didn't really officially meet.
It was just sort of like,

965
00:59:49,821 --> 00:59:53,600
if it was like a college admissions
thing [inaudible] we, you, you,

966
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:58,400
it's open application. Anybody who wants
to submit an application kit for, uh,

967
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:00,800
for the summer founders program,
which is basically,

968
01:00:00,870 --> 01:00:04,010
it was like the same thing as y Combinator
to like you get a little bit of money

969
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:07,190
and they'll all come together. Um, it was
like sort of y Combinator version one.

970
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:12,200
Um, but I applied and didn't get in
and I was super disappointed. Um,

971
01:00:12,290 --> 01:00:14,630
so that didn't go well. And
then, but a couple years later,

972
01:00:14,631 --> 01:00:19,631
I wanted to apply again with Dropbox
and this is skipping ahead a little bit,

973
01:00:20,061 --> 01:00:22,910
but, um, I had,

974
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:26,390
so I had the idea for Dropbox,
um,

975
01:00:26,391 --> 01:00:30,750
started working on it and I want to do
YC because a good friend of mine or for

976
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:35,600
for many reasons, but in a, in another
friend of mine, this Guy Adam Smith,

977
01:00:35,730 --> 01:00:40,170
uh, no relation, um, it was one
of her friends from college. Uh,

978
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:45,020
he did YC in 2006 and had an awesome
experience and I had like a front row seat

979
01:00:45,021 --> 01:00:46,460
to that and saw how
much fun they're having.

980
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:51,280
And then their company was just in like
a much faster trajectory because of YC

981
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:55,840
and I'm like, oh my God, I want
something like that. Um, but then I have,

982
01:00:55,841 --> 01:00:59,870
so I started thinking about
applying for YC with Dropbox.

983
01:01:00,370 --> 01:01:00,980
Um,

984
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:05,420
and one of the good things about coming
from college admissions is you sort of

985
01:01:05,421 --> 01:01:08,330
learn how these admissions processes work.
Um,

986
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:10,400
and YC was not really that different.

987
01:01:10,430 --> 01:01:13,580
You have a lot of people
applying for a few spots. Um,

988
01:01:13,610 --> 01:01:16,610
and so in addition to getting the
scores and the grades and everything,

989
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:20,690
one of the things you can do is try to
stand out and do something kind of unique.

990
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:23,000
And so I'm like,
all right,

991
01:01:23,001 --> 01:01:26,690
well maybe to get in
to help me get into Yc,

992
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:31,730
I'll try to put a video out
about how Dropbox works.

993
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:35,780
Um, and y Combinator also had their
own, they had just started this new,

994
01:01:35,781 --> 01:01:38,660
this new site called Hacker News,
um,

995
01:01:38,690 --> 01:01:43,670
which is kind of like reddit
first startup news. Um, and,

996
01:01:44,210 --> 01:01:47,810
uh, and I'm like, what is I'm buying?
I thought, I'm like, I had an,

997
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:50,720
I had a hunch and I'm like, what do you,
what do I, what does Paul do all day?

998
01:01:50,810 --> 01:01:53,060
I think he probably
does what most of us do,

999
01:01:53,061 --> 01:01:56,060
which is just hit refresh on hacker
news all the time. So I'm like,

1000
01:01:56,061 --> 01:01:59,090
maybe you have to put
a video on hacker news.

1001
01:01:59,091 --> 01:02:01,940
Maybe I can get in front of the dean of
admissions here to get Paul's attention

1002
01:02:01,941 --> 01:02:06,690
and then go from there. It actually
worked. Um, so I made and, and,

1003
01:02:06,691 --> 01:02:11,691
and I was a concept from a book that I
had read on that roof called guerrilla

1004
01:02:13,161 --> 01:02:13,641
marketing,

1005
01:02:13,641 --> 01:02:17,090
which is like how do you get attention
and you and users for your product if you

1006
01:02:17,091 --> 01:02:21,610
have no Jay Levinson, 11 cent
or something like that. Yeah,

1007
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:26,810
something like that. It's like, how do you
do that when you have no money? So, uh,

1008
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:29,950
and, and so they're like
all these, so there,

1009
01:02:29,970 --> 01:02:34,970
it's the tactic of putting a video on
hacker news or creating a viral video is

1010
01:02:35,630 --> 01:02:40,050
that that was a seed that was planted by
reading guerrilla marketing. Um, and so,

1011
01:02:40,051 --> 01:02:41,600
but I made a screencast or just like a,

1012
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:43,830
like a three minute demo
of how Dropbox works.

1013
01:02:43,831 --> 01:02:45,510
Cause like I wasn't
ready to ship the code,

1014
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:48,990
but I wanted some feedback and
I wanted to get into YC. Um,

1015
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:52,450
and that video both got me into
YC and it got me a cofounder. Um,

1016
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:55,830
but I didn't know that at the
time. So, uh, coming back to,

1017
01:02:56,070 --> 01:02:57,750
so then what happened with
this meeting with Paul?

1018
01:02:58,170 --> 01:02:59,670
So I put the video on hacker news.

1019
01:02:59,671 --> 01:03:03,510
It hits the top of hacker news for
multiple days. It's a long time.

1020
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:05,040
Talked about the top of hacker news APP.

1021
01:03:05,041 --> 01:03:08,220
That can't happen anymore because for
a bunch of reasons. But it was like,

1022
01:03:08,340 --> 01:03:12,930
I was pretty happy about that.
Um, and then, uh, I'm like, okay,

1023
01:03:12,931 --> 01:03:16,290
this is so far the plan seems
to be working. I'm just like,

1024
01:03:16,291 --> 01:03:20,520
keep hitting refresh on my inbox. I'm
like, maybe I wonder if Paul has seen it.

1025
01:03:20,580 --> 01:03:23,850
And then Lo and behold, I get an email
from Paul Graham saying like, Hey,

1026
01:03:23,851 --> 01:03:27,960
it looks pretty cool. Um,
but you need a cofounder.

1027
01:03:29,370 --> 01:03:30,750
Cause they did it,
especially at the time.

1028
01:03:30,751 --> 01:03:33,270
They didn't like single founders applying.
And I didn't have a cofounder yet.

1029
01:03:33,271 --> 01:03:37,410
This was, this was before I
met a rush. Um, so I was like,

1030
01:03:37,740 --> 01:03:42,000
Oh God. Um, because the PR, the
only problem was I agreed with him.

1031
01:03:42,690 --> 01:03:46,740
The only problem was the application
deadline was, had already passed.

1032
01:03:46,770 --> 01:03:51,210
I already applied. Um, and the
interviews were in like two weeks.

1033
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:55,650
And so I needed a cofounder in two
weeks, which is like saying like, Hey,

1034
01:03:55,950 --> 01:03:59,400
I know you're not dating anyone
but you need to get married by.

1035
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:06,240
Right. Uh, and so, uh,
hilarity ensued. But, uh,

1036
01:04:06,270 --> 01:04:08,820
but then I was, I can't, I flew
out to San Francisco. I'm like,

1037
01:04:08,850 --> 01:04:12,870
I'm like trying to shake the trees
for any cofounder candidates.

1038
01:04:12,871 --> 01:04:14,970
I hadn't thought of it because
for one reason or another,

1039
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:19,110
all of my close friends and
people that would have been the,

1040
01:04:19,530 --> 01:04:22,230
the folks that I would have leaned on,
like at the timing wasn't good.

1041
01:04:22,231 --> 01:04:26,570
They didn't want to do it,
whatever else. And so, um, but I,

1042
01:04:26,580 --> 01:04:28,760
I found, uh, another friend of mine,

1043
01:04:28,780 --> 01:04:32,310
I was actually getting managed to get
a friend of mine interested out in San

1044
01:04:32,310 --> 01:04:36,090
Francisco. Um, but he's like,
okay, I'm interested. I don't know,

1045
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:41,160
but I want to know what PG thinks before
I make a decision. So I'm like, okay,

1046
01:04:41,190 --> 01:04:45,080
great. Um, and I'm like, it's a Tuesday.

1047
01:04:45,110 --> 01:04:47,220
My flight is a Tuesday at like 1:00 PM.

1048
01:04:47,430 --> 01:04:52,320
My flight back to Boston leads
it like 10 or 11. So I'm like,

1049
01:04:53,070 --> 01:04:57,540
oh actually wait, this is, YC
has its dinners on Tuesdays.

1050
01:04:57,750 --> 01:05:02,750
Maybe I can just like drive
down to mountain view and
just like pitch Paul maybe

1051
01:05:02,941 --> 01:05:05,040
that will

1052
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:11,830
visit bar. I like fly
down in one on one. Um,

1053
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:15,860
and like the plan was working pretty well.
I got it.

1054
01:05:16,810 --> 01:05:20,830
I got to Yc, I went in the
office. It was as expected.

1055
01:05:20,831 --> 01:05:25,240
People were just chilling and kind of,
um, there was some downtime. And so,

1056
01:05:25,540 --> 01:05:29,530
um,
and so I go knock on,

1057
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:32,860
or like I go, I go to Paul's office
and sure enough he's in there.

1058
01:05:32,861 --> 01:05:36,780
He's just challenge my, Hey
Paul, do you have a minute?
Um, I just want to, you know,

1059
01:05:36,820 --> 01:05:40,120
I just want to show you something I'm
working on. And he's like, no, I'm busy.

1060
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:47,110
And I'm like, okay, look, we bought, I'm
like, I, I can almost see your screen.

1061
01:05:47,111 --> 01:05:48,330
I know you're just like hitting reef.

1062
01:05:48,370 --> 01:05:53,080
You're just like reading hacker
news right now. Actually busy. Um,

1063
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:57,830
but it's like awkward. So I step
outside and I talked to Jessica, um,

1064
01:05:57,940 --> 01:06:00,100
who as an, uh, his,

1065
01:06:00,101 --> 01:06:04,780
his partner at in cofounding YC
together. And, and, and his wife.

1066
01:06:05,310 --> 01:06:07,360
Um, and I talked to Jessica,
I'm like, Hey, look,

1067
01:06:07,361 --> 01:06:10,060
Jessica and I had met Jessica
before, so I'm like, Jessica,

1068
01:06:10,061 --> 01:06:11,620
I'm really sorry to bother you guys.

1069
01:06:11,621 --> 01:06:16,210
I just have a cofounder who
was like looking for some
feedback from Paul to make

1070
01:06:16,211 --> 01:06:20,110
his cofounder decision. You know, I
got a flight back in like four hours.

1071
01:06:20,630 --> 01:06:23,320
I swear I'll, I'll, I won't take
more than 60 seconds of Paul's time.

1072
01:06:23,321 --> 01:06:28,210
Do you think it's okay if, um,
if I go in there and she's like,

1073
01:06:28,211 --> 01:06:29,980
oh, we've got drew of
course, like, no problem.

1074
01:06:29,981 --> 01:06:33,790
Like Paul's not doing anything
just like he'll, it'll be fine.

1075
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:38,590
So I go back in there

1076
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:40,853
and

1077
01:06:41,390 --> 01:06:44,480
it's like detonation,

1078
01:06:44,570 --> 01:06:48,380
it's like I still like three words
and Paul's like, no, he's like,

1079
01:06:48,381 --> 01:06:50,330
I'm not going to see your stupid demo.

1080
01:06:50,450 --> 01:06:53,690
The whole reason we have an application
process so that randos like,

1081
01:06:53,691 --> 01:06:58,010
you don't just like show up here
and bother us. It's like, no,

1082
01:06:58,190 --> 01:07:02,690
please leave. And so I'm like, okay,

1083
01:07:02,691 --> 01:07:07,520
thanks Jessica. Thanks Paul. Like,
Ooh, like my friend that's, I'm like,

1084
01:07:07,730 --> 01:07:10,250
this is not going to be good.
And like it was a rough,

1085
01:07:10,251 --> 01:07:13,160
rough returned to San Francisco.
So needless to say,

1086
01:07:13,161 --> 01:07:17,270
the cofounders situation did not work
out. You were like there, Paul's,

1087
01:07:17,271 --> 01:07:20,180
Paul's thinking about it. Let
me get back to you. I did,

1088
01:07:20,181 --> 01:07:23,360
I did meet with the dean of admissions.
He just thinks I'm an asshole.

1089
01:07:25,010 --> 01:07:28,880
So that was, I think he's,
I think he's coming around.

1090
01:07:29,110 --> 01:07:33,140
Get back to that was a tough plane
ride home. Um, but as good training,

1091
01:07:33,141 --> 01:07:33,961
like this is, you know, this,

1092
01:07:33,961 --> 01:07:38,300
this is you gotta this is like the new
normal if you're starting a company. Um,

1093
01:07:39,210 --> 01:07:42,170
so let me, let me just hit pause
for one second. What were you,

1094
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:44,960
what were you saying to
yourself on the way back?

1095
01:07:44,961 --> 01:07:49,100
Like what was the self talk on the
plane ride back? I was like, I have,

1096
01:07:49,130 --> 01:07:53,570
I could not have like eff this
up any worse if I had tried.

1097
01:07:54,930 --> 01:07:57,980
Um, cause like now and I'm
co founder and I'm like,

1098
01:07:57,981 --> 01:08:01,880
I might've been able to
get in if I just like,

1099
01:08:03,130 --> 01:08:07,610
hadn't like maximally pissed off Paul.

1100
01:08:07,890 --> 01:08:08,723
Okay.

1101
01:08:09,450 --> 01:08:13,410
Anyway, now I have no cofounder,
no YC and probably know company.

1102
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:18,890
Um, and like two weeks left
to like resolve this, um,

1103
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:23,090
may or maybe a week left to resolve.
But anyway, not a lot of time. Um,

1104
01:08:23,091 --> 01:08:24,710
so it was bad. Yeah. I was like,

1105
01:08:24,740 --> 01:08:27,770
I don't really see how this all
kind of lives happily ever after.

1106
01:08:29,630 --> 01:08:32,090
So then what happened?
So then,

1107
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:37,580
but my kind of shaking the trees in
San Francisco did help. So I met, it.

1108
01:08:37,581 --> 01:08:42,581
Turned out I met a guy
named Kyle convoked,

1109
01:08:42,890 --> 01:08:46,400
um, who I'd met at the Mit entrepreneurs
club. So he's an MIT student.

1110
01:08:46,401 --> 01:08:50,090
He dropped out here.
He had just dropped out to do Justin TV,

1111
01:08:50,690 --> 01:08:55,340
which became twitch. Um, and then
Kyle then later started cruise,

1112
01:08:55,550 --> 01:08:59,750
which did degrades Kyle
Kyle has done well. Um,

1113
01:09:00,590 --> 01:09:04,040
and then I was complaining
to Kyle and like, hey Kyle,
like I need a cofounder. I,

1114
01:09:04,041 --> 01:09:07,500
you know, is there anyone
you'd recommend? And he,

1115
01:09:07,530 --> 01:09:09,240
he recommended me to a,

1116
01:09:09,330 --> 01:09:13,310
it turned out that Kyle and Raj
were four made cities campus at Mit.

1117
01:09:13,830 --> 01:09:18,470
Um, and so he's like, Oh, you should talk
to a rush. And then a day or two later,

1118
01:09:18,471 --> 01:09:22,370
I got an email from [inaudible]
saying, hey, um, he was like, uh,

1119
01:09:22,430 --> 01:09:27,230
he was a senior Undergrad at MIT
computer science student. Um,

1120
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:32,060
and, uh, and he was like, hey, I got
this email from rush and say like, Hey,

1121
01:09:32,061 --> 01:09:35,720
I saw your video on hacker news.
And Kyle said,

1122
01:09:35,721 --> 01:09:38,420
you're looking for a cofounder.
You know, maybe we should talk.

1123
01:09:39,830 --> 01:09:44,000
And then it was kind of insane.
Like we met in the student center.

1124
01:09:44,510 --> 01:09:48,770
Um, maybe we got coffee one more
time and then he drops out of school.

1125
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:53,770
Um, he's like a senior, he drops
off with a semester left. You know,

1126
01:09:53,780 --> 01:09:56,000
I was thinking this is going to be
like a process. Right. As I mentioned,

1127
01:09:56,010 --> 01:09:59,840
I talked to his parents and like reassure
them if I notice like we hang out for

1128
01:09:59,841 --> 01:10:03,740
like two hours and then
he then like come then we,

1129
01:10:03,741 --> 01:10:07,880
the two of us commit to like spending
most of our waking lives together for the

1130
01:10:07,881 --> 01:10:08,810
foreseeable future.

1131
01:10:09,350 --> 01:10:12,290
I don't think either of us really
understood that at the time. Um,

1132
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:16,460
fortunately it all has worked
out great. But, um, so, but,

1133
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:20,040
but against all odds. So
our osh and I team up, um,

1134
01:10:20,930 --> 01:10:24,710
I think Paul forgot about his meeting
with me or didn't like put the two

1135
01:10:24,711 --> 01:10:29,140
together. So we, we did our
interview, um, and we got into Yc,

1136
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:34,130
so, and it was funny cause
like we were doing the white,

1137
01:10:34,140 --> 01:10:38,900
the interview were milling around waiting
for who? We go down in the morning,

1138
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:43,490
we go get lunch. Um, we
come back to the car,

1139
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:48,290
are our car got broken into on
our laptops, got stolen. Oh God.

1140
01:10:49,130 --> 01:10:51,260
But fortunately all of
our stuff was on Dropbox,

1141
01:10:51,590 --> 01:10:54,680
so we were like patient zero for all this.

1142
01:10:54,710 --> 01:10:57,440
And then we got the happy phone
call from Paul saying, Hey,

1143
01:10:57,441 --> 01:11:01,250
we want to fund you guys. And
ended up, I mean, I dunno, it was,

1144
01:11:01,251 --> 01:11:02,500
it was nuts though.

1145
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:08,750
So I don't know if this has changed,
but for some period of time,

1146
01:11:09,580 --> 01:11:14,010
uh, I think it's probably still the case,
but, but you could correct me if I'm

1147
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:14,491
wrong.
I mean,

1148
01:11:14,491 --> 01:11:19,491
Dropbox was far and away the
most successful investment
that y Combinator had

1149
01:11:20,071 --> 01:11:23,810
ever made, uh, ended up, I mean,

1150
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:25,800
certainly Dropbox has
done incredibly well.

1151
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:31,600
At what points did you go to
go to Paul's office and knock,

1152
01:11:32,791 --> 01:11:35,940
knock. Hey Paul. Like in
brackets now we're friends

1153
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:38,940
by any chance?

1154
01:11:38,941 --> 01:11:43,941
Do you remember when I came in daring
Tuesday on a Tuesday not too long ago,

1155
01:11:46,231 --> 01:11:46,800
Dah,
Dah.

1156
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:50,790
Did you ever bring that up with him or
did he learn about it through some other

1157
01:11:50,791 --> 01:11:51,624
means?

1158
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:56,640
I like to remind them about it.
Every camp, every year to first.

1159
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:59,070
He's like totally embarrassed.
Like he didn't, like,

1160
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:03,090
he didn't put any of these
things together. He didn't
know, he didn't remember it.

1161
01:12:03,870 --> 01:12:07,740
Um, he's like, I was so awful at this
app. So the, the mostly it's just they,

1162
01:12:07,770 --> 01:12:11,160
they both Paul and Jessica to turn like
bright red and they don't like to talk

1163
01:12:11,161 --> 01:12:14,700
about it, which is like why I like to
keep poking at it every now and then.

1164
01:12:16,170 --> 01:12:19,920
It's all, I mean, it's all good. I
would have done this course him. Well,

1165
01:12:19,921 --> 01:12:23,240
he did tell you I'm busy, right?
Yeah, I was super obnoxious, but

1166
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:28,690
some was dropped. It was Dropbox, the
original name of the company. Yeah,

1167
01:12:29,380 --> 01:12:33,970
it was. Wow. So, so just from day
one you had the name that stuck.

1168
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:35,750
Oh, pretty good. Getting the domain.

1169
01:12:35,930 --> 01:12:40,930
It was get dropbox.com getting
the dropbox.com domain name was,

1170
01:12:41,870 --> 01:12:45,800
oh my God, that was a,
that was the journey. Um,

1171
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:51,320
so there was, I don't know, I'm like,

1172
01:12:51,321 --> 01:12:53,710
I'm like starting to shake a
little bit going. I don't know.

1173
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:57,110
I don't know how illuminating
this the story is, but it had no,

1174
01:12:57,111 --> 01:13:00,610
let's talk about it people, I mean
people run into this stuff. I'm sure.

1175
01:13:00,620 --> 01:13:03,250
I'm sure we can. I'm sure we
can pull some lessons from that.

1176
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:08,100
So I I remember get Dropbox.
So ration, I fell like,

1177
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:09,140
so the,
the,

1178
01:13:09,330 --> 01:13:13,640
the name Dropbox actually
the behind the music version,

1179
01:13:13,670 --> 01:13:18,670
like the story behind the name is also
probably unintuitive or like not what

1180
01:13:18,831 --> 01:13:23,270
you'd expect. So, um, you asked what am I
like, what was that like in high school?

1181
01:13:23,540 --> 01:13:27,560
Um, and the answer is like, basically
he's a huge nerd who likes computer games.

1182
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:32,060
And that's true. Uh, one of the things
we would do is we'd all bring our,

1183
01:13:32,450 --> 01:13:33,000
uh,

1184
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:36,230
w we would like a bunch of friends and
I would bring our computers to someone's

1185
01:13:36,231 --> 01:13:41,090
house and we'd play games.
And, um, so back in the day,

1186
01:13:41,091 --> 01:13:45,710
these things were called land parties. Um,
they are about as cool as they camp. Um,

1187
01:13:46,070 --> 01:13:49,460
and uh, and, and you know,
you all show up and played,

1188
01:13:49,750 --> 01:13:52,460
you play Til Sunrise
and, and, um, and so on.

1189
01:13:52,461 --> 01:13:56,330
But you bring a bunch of people together
and often someone doesn't have the,

1190
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:59,120
the right maps or the right
patch or the right whatever.

1191
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:00,260
And so we had a convention,

1192
01:14:00,261 --> 01:14:04,970
like you've just create a folder called
your Dropbox that's shared and writeable

1193
01:14:04,971 --> 01:14:08,840
by anyone. Um, and that's how
he would exchange files. Um,

1194
01:14:09,770 --> 01:14:14,350
so that people could play games.
Um, and then it's, I remember this,

1195
01:14:14,351 --> 01:14:17,410
it was like Christmas 2006.

1196
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:22,150
I'm trying to come up with a name for
Dropbox nor didn't have a name then. I,

1197
01:14:22,510 --> 01:14:26,930
uh, the initial name, I had like some, uh,

1198
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:30,700
what the name before I was dizzy,
photoshopping a logo.

1199
01:14:30,701 --> 01:14:35,701
Is it initial iteration of it
was folder anywhere which catchy.

1200
01:14:36,130 --> 01:14:39,730
Catchy, yes. Which just was,

1201
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:43,510
which was probably the first indication
that I had a brilliant future in

1202
01:14:43,511 --> 01:14:46,330
marketing and for this.

1203
01:14:48,490 --> 01:14:52,450
And then some like in Photoshop trying
to make a logo for folder anywhere.

1204
01:14:52,451 --> 01:14:53,201
And I'm like,
I'm like,

1205
01:14:53,201 --> 01:14:56,620
of course the probably the logo was
like a literal folder or something like

1206
01:14:56,621 --> 01:15:00,490
totally inane.
And then I start and I'm like,

1207
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:05,860
and I, you know, believe it or not fold
or anywhere.com was actually available.

1208
01:15:05,870 --> 01:15:09,230
So I, I was the proud owner
of older anywhere that com.

1209
01:15:09,700 --> 01:15:12,190
Then I realized that I did a search and
I found that there's a company called

1210
01:15:12,191 --> 01:15:16,420
files anywhere and I was like,
no,

1211
01:15:17,290 --> 01:15:20,770
like I can't, I that's, it's like I can't,
now, I can't name it folder anywhere.

1212
01:15:20,771 --> 01:15:22,150
And so I'm,
I'm sort of,

1213
01:15:22,151 --> 01:15:26,140
I'm on aim talking to one of my friends
from high school and I'm like, God,

1214
01:15:26,141 --> 01:15:30,610
I don't know what to call this thing,
you know, folder anywhere it's taken.

1215
01:15:31,180 --> 01:15:34,930
Like, maybe I should just, you know,
maybe maybe I should call it Dropbox,

1216
01:15:34,931 --> 01:15:39,640
like from the, you know, from, from high
school or from land parties and he's like,

1217
01:15:40,060 --> 01:15:42,910
okay, whatever. And then, um,

1218
01:15:43,690 --> 01:15:46,570
and then I Dropbox like how not available.
Uh,

1219
01:15:46,571 --> 01:15:49,780
so I got get dropbox.com but then,
um,

1220
01:15:50,860 --> 01:15:54,580
so we just lived with get dropbox.com
for awhile. I tried to you,

1221
01:15:54,581 --> 01:15:57,720
you can sometimes look up who owns a
domain and then contact them. And so I,

1222
01:15:57,890 --> 01:16:02,500
I actually did, I amended that I managed
to give the guy a call, um, and I'm like,

1223
01:16:02,501 --> 01:16:06,400
Hey, are you dropbox.com? You
know, are you, are you using
it? And the guy was like,

1224
01:16:06,610 --> 01:16:10,600
uh, yes, I'm using it for
a project. I'm like, okay,

1225
01:16:10,601 --> 01:16:12,850
well do you have any interest
in like selling it or, you know,

1226
01:16:13,010 --> 01:16:17,770
coming up with some kind of arrangement?
He's like, no. I'm like, okay, cool.

1227
01:16:19,060 --> 01:16:22,840
So that's February,
2007 and then,

1228
01:16:23,770 --> 01:16:26,800
then we then, then we get distracted
with the whole getting into Yc,

1229
01:16:26,801 --> 01:16:30,190
finding a cofounder, all that
doing YC, and then I land in,

1230
01:16:30,220 --> 01:16:34,090
then we moved to San Francisco
in September and I'm like,

1231
01:16:34,091 --> 01:16:38,100
we really need to get this domain
name. Um, and unfortunately our ration,

1232
01:16:38,140 --> 01:16:41,740
I had totally fallen in love with it.
So like we weren't really,

1233
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:46,430
we kind of only had one
plan. Um, by the way, that's,

1234
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:50,350
that's called a great, uh,
negotiating position. Yeah. Awesome.

1235
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:55,300
About as well as you'd
expect. So we, I'm like, well,

1236
01:16:55,301 --> 01:16:58,960
since the fluffiness Zipcar and show up
at someone's house worked so well the

1237
01:16:58,961 --> 01:17:00,070
first time,
we're going to do it again.

1238
01:17:00,490 --> 01:17:05,290
So it turned out the guy
lived in Pleasanton, um,
and he was an entrepreneur.

1239
01:17:05,540 --> 01:17:06,760
Here's someone who like nearby,

1240
01:17:06,790 --> 01:17:11,780
who should be sympathetic to our cause
at to some extent. Um, and I'm like,

1241
01:17:11,870 --> 01:17:14,240
and I call him and I'm like,
how's that project going?

1242
01:17:14,450 --> 01:17:19,450
Because there's obviously no project in
and he's just kind of being difficult.

1243
01:17:19,940 --> 01:17:24,920
Um, and so I'm like, I'm
like, okay, God damn it.

1244
01:17:24,980 --> 01:17:27,910
We get off the phone and I'm like,
are Ashley's,

1245
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:29,810
let's just like show
up at this guy's house.

1246
01:17:31,790 --> 01:17:35,930
Let's just see what happens.
Um, so jumping into other car,

1247
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:37,100
we go to the,

1248
01:17:37,580 --> 01:17:40,730
that we've dropped when they go to the
like the the corner store and get their

1249
01:17:40,731 --> 01:17:44,960
like most expensive bottle of
$20 champagne. We could get, uh,

1250
01:17:45,860 --> 01:17:50,840
get as a car and go to his house
and um, it's like nine at night.

1251
01:17:50,870 --> 01:17:55,090
So I don't know, for some,

1252
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:56,510
this seemed like a good idea at the time.

1253
01:17:56,511 --> 01:18:01,340
So we show up then and then he was kind
of, I think he was kind of shocked,

1254
01:18:01,341 --> 01:18:04,940
kind of amused. It's like lets
us in. Um, we have a suite,

1255
01:18:04,941 --> 01:18:08,630
we start talking and he's
like, we're like, hey look,
you know, we're, we're, we're,

1256
01:18:08,631 --> 01:18:13,100
we're pretty serious about this thing
we're doing. You know, we'd love, um,

1257
01:18:13,190 --> 01:18:13,571
you know,
if,

1258
01:18:13,571 --> 01:18:17,090
if it's true that you're not actually
doing anything with the domain, you know,

1259
01:18:17,091 --> 01:18:19,850
like help, help us understand
what you're trying to accomplish.

1260
01:18:20,250 --> 01:18:22,430
[inaudible] noxious way.
Just like, you know,

1261
01:18:23,570 --> 01:18:28,250
but at least consider this alternative
where you know, we use dropbox.com.

1262
01:18:28,730 --> 01:18:28,941
You know,

1263
01:18:28,941 --> 01:18:32,900
we've got some really good folks who
are excited about this in involved,

1264
01:18:32,901 --> 01:18:35,210
whether that's y Combinator,
we just gotten funding from sequoia,

1265
01:18:35,660 --> 01:18:38,930
our first venture capital investor
who one of the best in the world.

1266
01:18:38,931 --> 01:18:42,890
And so we're like, oh you, oh you, oh,
you told him that? Yeah. All right. Yeah,

1267
01:18:42,891 --> 01:18:44,840
that's really building
up our leverage here.

1268
01:18:47,050 --> 01:18:51,050
So this would be called hemorrhaging
leverage all at the same time.

1269
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,950
You know, these, these, uh,

1270
01:18:54,990 --> 01:18:57,920
the frameworks don't completely account
for everything cause if you don't,

1271
01:18:58,340 --> 01:19:02,330
if you don't actually help them understand
why they should be interested and you

1272
01:19:02,331 --> 01:19:05,220
hold all your cards to the vest and
nothing happens and that's what we can

1273
01:19:05,290 --> 01:19:08,510
experience over the last seven
months. So we're like, um, okay,

1274
01:19:08,511 --> 01:19:12,500
so like at least get sketch out a case
that a reasonable person would look at

1275
01:19:12,501 --> 01:19:16,640
and be interested in. So,
um, and then he's like,

1276
01:19:17,180 --> 01:19:21,530
um, cool. Uh, it's interesting,
I got to talk to a friend.

1277
01:19:22,180 --> 01:19:26,540
Um, and you know, why don't you,
why don't we touch base soon?

1278
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:29,590
And I'm like, I'm like, great. Well,
it was like Friday. I'm like, whoa.

1279
01:19:29,660 --> 01:19:33,980
It was like a Friday night,
I think. And I'm like, well,
we'll be back on Monday. Um,

1280
01:19:34,250 --> 01:19:37,220
and we're, we're in the ride back going
over the bay bridge. And I'm like,

1281
01:19:37,221 --> 01:19:39,590
Holy Shit, we might actually
be able to get this thing,

1282
01:19:39,620 --> 01:19:42,140
like this guy has been
impenetrable and so difficult.

1283
01:19:42,770 --> 01:19:47,720
Like we're both kind of in awe and just
like, this is such a positive thing.

1284
01:19:48,860 --> 01:19:53,750
So we go back on Monday and he's
just like, Yep, thought about it,

1285
01:19:53,751 --> 01:19:57,860
not interested. Thanks. Bye.
And we're like, are you kidding?

1286
01:19:58,580 --> 01:20:02,270
Is this for real? Like, no. I'm like,
I'm like, where's this going to go?

1287
01:20:02,271 --> 01:20:05,690
Are you going to like, are you going to
bequeath this domain to your children?

1288
01:20:05,691 --> 01:20:08,430
Like, what the hell? Um,

1289
01:20:08,940 --> 01:20:10,920
but he was just like
totally wouldn't budge.

1290
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:13,440
And so that was a much sadder drive back.

1291
01:20:15,620 --> 01:20:16,830
So then this guy,

1292
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:22,110
and then there's just kind of nothing
for a couple of years or for a year. Um,

1293
01:20:22,170 --> 01:20:26,550
and then we launched drop out. We
put a, we launched Dropbox publicly,

1294
01:20:26,670 --> 01:20:27,503
um,

1295
01:20:28,290 --> 01:20:33,290
and then all these confused
people start going to dropbox.com,

1296
01:20:34,470 --> 01:20:39,300
uh, and, and presumably start trying to
get, and they wanted to get into the Beta.

1297
01:20:39,301 --> 01:20:41,790
So this is, this is later in the
air. So the, the, the, and the,

1298
01:20:41,791 --> 01:20:45,240
so that he starts getting all these emails
from people, I think probably March,

1299
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:49,350
2008, um, who were looking to
get into the Dropbox data. Um,

1300
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:53,050
and then he, he does God, he,

1301
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:57,540
and I'll end the story in a reasonable
amount of time, but we like,

1302
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:00,810
so he,
he then he kind of goes dark,

1303
01:21:00,811 --> 01:21:05,610
he puts a privacy shield up on the domain,
then puts up an ad words landing page.

1304
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:08,230
So like dropbox.com, like it was a, no,

1305
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:11,520
it went from like a go daddy parking
page to like a Google adsense for domains

1306
01:21:11,521 --> 01:21:15,450
page. Um, which was a problem
because then we're like, oh my God,

1307
01:21:15,451 --> 01:21:17,460
now this guy is like totally cashing in.

1308
01:21:18,030 --> 01:21:21,060
Like it's basically
you go to Dropbox icon.

1309
01:21:21,061 --> 01:21:24,950
It was basically ad words for all
of our competitors. Oh God. Um,

1310
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:26,880
and so I'm just thinking of like,
I'm like,

1311
01:21:26,881 --> 01:21:28,440
what the hell are we gonna do about this?

1312
01:21:28,441 --> 01:21:31,590
Like our investors think we're
idiots for not changing the name.

1313
01:21:31,591 --> 01:21:35,760
We're doing all these like pointless
and branding exercises that,

1314
01:21:36,980 --> 01:21:40,800
um, did not go well, like to
try to find an alternate name.

1315
01:21:40,801 --> 01:21:45,450
So I'm just like, oh my God, look
what, what are we going to do?

1316
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:51,320
And the answer was read the Federal
Copyright Code and a trademark code.

1317
01:21:55,020 --> 01:21:55,853
Um,

1318
01:21:55,950 --> 01:22:00,870
and I became kind of an
expert in Cyber Trademark Law.

1319
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:05,940
I got an armchair expert in this stuff
and it turns out you can't just like get

1320
01:22:05,941 --> 01:22:08,940
a domain from someone for no reason.
Like you can't just be like, oh,

1321
01:22:08,970 --> 01:22:12,150
you're not using it, so therefore it's
mine anymore. You can can be like, oh,

1322
01:22:12,151 --> 01:22:13,830
you're not using that
land to give it to me.

1323
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:20,550
But it is also illegal for
someone to intentionally confused,

1324
01:22:20,620 --> 01:22:25,350
um, uh, confused customer can
confuse your customers. So,

1325
01:22:25,770 --> 01:22:30,240
um, I can't just like say
that were, um, you know,

1326
01:22:30,241 --> 01:22:35,241
I can't sell paper teller tell or I
can't sell like Kleenex with three e's to

1327
01:22:35,821 --> 01:22:36,780
confuse people or whatever.

1328
01:22:36,781 --> 01:22:40,560
So like intentionally confusing
consumers is a problem. Um,

1329
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:45,000
and we had another whole odyssey
trying to get the Dropbox trademark,

1330
01:22:45,001 --> 01:22:48,110
which aisle that's not as interesting, but
I'm like, we had a problem what we did,

1331
01:22:48,111 --> 01:22:51,480
we didn't actually have the
registered trademark either. Um,

1332
01:22:51,510 --> 01:22:55,980
but he was now making money
from infringing on our
common law trademark rights.

1333
01:22:56,220 --> 01:23:00,210
And so I'm working with this
crazy trademark like was
like trademark and domain

1334
01:23:00,930 --> 01:23:05,250
attorney. And so we sue him for
federal, for trademark infringement.

1335
01:23:05,950 --> 01:23:09,910
Um, and so that got his attention. Um,

1336
01:23:10,730 --> 01:23:13,600
and, and which we would not
have done it. Like we're not,

1337
01:23:13,601 --> 01:23:15,250
we weren't just trying to push
him around. I mean, he was really,

1338
01:23:15,251 --> 01:23:19,450
he was sure trying to
profit off of confusing our
customers. So we were for sure.

1339
01:23:19,451 --> 01:23:23,140
Dot on our high horse
after that. Um, and I mean,

1340
01:23:23,141 --> 01:23:28,090
that was a comical whole experience, but
eventually he's like, okay, okay, okay.

1341
01:23:28,150 --> 01:23:32,830
Um, you know, all, all like, let's, this
is, there's no point to have this lawsuit.

1342
01:23:33,250 --> 01:23:36,400
You know, I'll give you guys are, I'll
tell you guys the domain, I'm like, okay,

1343
01:23:36,401 --> 01:23:40,880
well we can offer use stock or cash.
She's like, I'll just take cash. Um,

1344
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:45,010
so we paid him 300 grand,
got the domain live.

1345
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:46,150
I mean that was such a,

1346
01:23:46,180 --> 01:23:51,180
like sending that first email from
dropbox.com to Paul and Jessica was a huge

1347
01:23:52,991 --> 01:23:57,440
triumph. Um, but what's even it,

1348
01:23:57,670 --> 01:23:58,503
I offer,

1349
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:04,500
we offered him stock at that like at w
would have been at the seed round the

1350
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:08,170
most God worth like multiple hundreds
of millions of dollars today.

1351
01:24:12,850 --> 01:24:16,590
Oh Man.
I think what you can

1352
01:24:16,660 --> 01:24:19,580
take away from this, it's like there's
just no manual for that, right?

1353
01:24:19,610 --> 01:24:21,890
You got to kind of wing it.

1354
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:23,930
And there were a lot of things
that are the equivalent.

1355
01:24:23,931 --> 01:24:27,830
Even today I've just kind of getting in
the zip car with a bottle of champagne

1356
01:24:27,831 --> 01:24:32,530
and hoping for the best and, and um, you
know, sometimes we get really good cards.

1357
01:24:32,531 --> 01:24:35,780
Sometimes you get really bad cards, but
you just got to kind of roll with it. Um,

1358
01:24:35,900 --> 01:24:40,300
and so, um, between finding a
cofounder, getting the domain, each,

1359
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:41,330
each of those is definitely,

1360
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,940
those are definitely memorable
points along the journey.

1361
01:24:45,090 --> 01:24:50,080
Well, we were chatting a bit before we
started recording about the psychological

1362
01:24:50,081 --> 01:24:53,650
aspects of say,
prepping for starting a company.

1363
01:24:53,770 --> 01:24:58,090
And I want to tie that to a
company you mentioned earlier,

1364
01:24:58,091 --> 01:25:02,980
which is reddit and see you mentioned
that hacker news is sort of read it for

1365
01:25:03,160 --> 01:25:07,360
the,
the computer science slash hacker subset.

1366
01:25:07,420 --> 01:25:12,420
Rhett and I remember having Alexis the
cofounder on this podcast and he told me

1367
01:25:15,311 --> 01:25:18,940
about meeting really early on
with an executive at Yahoo.

1368
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:19,930
They were really excited.

1369
01:25:19,931 --> 01:25:24,190
They went in and they shared their
numbers in the executive said wow,

1370
01:25:24,250 --> 01:25:25,900
if something along the lines of Oh my God,

1371
01:25:25,901 --> 01:25:30,730
you're just a rounding error for Yahoo.
And it was so insulting

1372
01:25:32,260 --> 01:25:35,800
that Alexis took like
you are a rounding error,

1373
01:25:35,801 --> 01:25:39,370
I think it was and put it on the wall
in the office to motivate. Right.

1374
01:25:39,490 --> 01:25:44,470
But that's, that is one of
several different responses
that that are possible.

1375
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:47,740
Right. I mean there are,
there are certainly people
who would be crushed by that.

1376
01:25:47,770 --> 01:25:51,070
It could be the end. Uh, and I don't,

1377
01:25:51,220 --> 01:25:53,440
I don't remember exactly
where this quote is from,

1378
01:25:53,441 --> 01:25:58,441
but I want to talk about when
this came out and how you,

1379
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:04,100
what the self talk was. So the, he, uh,
okay. This, there's an article being

1380
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:08,090
written about Dropbox and I
think the quote was quote,

1381
01:26:08,091 --> 01:26:11,180
fortunately the Dropbox
founders are too stupid to know.

1382
01:26:11,181 --> 01:26:15,080
Everyone's already tried
this and quote. Yeah. Uh,

1383
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:20,170
so when did that happen and how did you
and anyone else involved respond to it?

1384
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:28,350
Yeah, so that was very early. Um,

1385
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:32,530
I would say it was probably
within the first year and, uh,

1386
01:26:32,660 --> 01:26:37,130
probably the most, well, I think
what happens is you'll get,

1387
01:26:38,010 --> 01:26:38,460
I mean,

1388
01:26:38,460 --> 01:26:40,910
I just think that even back to that
first video that I put it on Hacker News,

1389
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:45,200
a lot of the, actually a lot
of the commentary was positive.

1390
01:26:45,201 --> 01:26:49,970
People like I would use
something like this, it's good.
Like, and it was really, um,

1391
01:26:51,110 --> 01:26:53,780
uh, and that was really encouraging.
So it's all on the one hand,

1392
01:26:53,810 --> 01:26:56,870
half the peanut gallery saying
that the other half is saying like,

1393
01:26:56,871 --> 01:27:00,920
listing all these reasons why it's been
tried before and won't work. Um, that,

1394
01:27:00,921 --> 01:27:03,320
and then even if it does
work, like Microsoft, Google,

1395
01:27:03,770 --> 01:27:06,250
everybody is going to kill us.
Um,

1396
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:09,590
and here's why it's never been a business
and here are all these other ones that

1397
01:27:09,591 --> 01:27:14,270
have never succeeded at. And the things
that I agreed with them, I was like,

1398
01:27:14,271 --> 01:27:19,070
yeah, you're probably right. Like, I
don't really see how we survive as,

1399
01:27:19,820 --> 01:27:24,820
I mean in 2007 I don't see how
we kind of make it through,

1400
01:27:25,700 --> 01:27:27,650
you know,
to mount doom,

1401
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:33,830
little plucky band of,
uh, the two of us. Um,

1402
01:27:33,890 --> 01:27:34,723
so,

1403
01:27:34,940 --> 01:27:39,170
and then invariably every investor we
talked to would raise similar concerns.

1404
01:27:39,171 --> 01:27:42,190
So the, the, the feedback is
all pretty negative. So, um,

1405
01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:47,570
it's easy to say like, oh, just ignore
it all, but you, you kind of have to,

1406
01:27:47,660 --> 01:27:49,100
you have to be balanced.
So on the, on the one hand,

1407
01:27:49,101 --> 01:27:51,500
we did get encouraging feedback in
the beginning, so people were like,

1408
01:27:51,501 --> 01:27:55,610
drop this as cool. I will use this.
It sounds great. Um, you know,

1409
01:27:55,670 --> 01:28:00,230
and I knew that I needed it and then I
wasn't like trying to create $1 billion

1410
01:28:00,231 --> 01:28:02,480
company. I was trying to
just like solve the problem.

1411
01:28:02,820 --> 01:28:05,810
And so I think setting your sights
low in the beginning ironically,

1412
01:28:06,410 --> 01:28:09,200
can be helpful because you're not
putting so much pressure on yourself.

1413
01:28:09,230 --> 01:28:10,940
I was just like, look,
if I show the cool thing,

1414
01:28:11,180 --> 01:28:14,990
it'll be one of this is just another side
project and a number of side projects

1415
01:28:14,991 --> 01:28:19,280
and like, let me not suffocate
it by putting all these
crazy expectations on it.

1416
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:23,570
Um, so I think that's pretty important.
Um, and then people are like, oh,

1417
01:28:23,571 --> 01:28:25,580
when did he know it was a
success? It's like, well,

1418
01:28:25,610 --> 01:28:27,160
it was sort of a different point. It, it,

1419
01:28:27,170 --> 01:28:30,230
it was like the goalpost for success
kept successively moving back.

1420
01:28:30,231 --> 01:28:35,231
So even just having a video was a big
milestone in launching a private beta was

1421
01:28:35,331 --> 01:28:37,580
a big milestone and there were
a bunch of milestones, but,

1422
01:28:37,581 --> 01:28:41,180
so it was sort of a continuous
project process more than like, oh,

1423
01:28:41,181 --> 01:28:43,970
is this one moment in time? Um, but yeah,

1424
01:28:43,971 --> 01:28:48,590
there were people who had very good
arguments about why this wasn't gonna be

1425
01:28:48,591 --> 01:28:52,070
successful. And that's why I think, um,

1426
01:28:53,150 --> 01:28:55,940
you have to have,
you have to sort of have alternate,

1427
01:28:55,941 --> 01:28:58,100
you have to have both
thick skin and thin skin,

1428
01:28:59,130 --> 01:29:01,980
I guess to have kind of get that
balance right. Because if you just have,

1429
01:29:02,310 --> 01:29:06,290
if you just ignore all of the feedback
and dismiss it all, then you're PR,

1430
01:29:06,330 --> 01:29:08,820
you're probably going to have some
kind of blind spot and you're gonna,

1431
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:13,880
you're gonna miss some
important information. So, um,
just because they came, but,

1432
01:29:13,890 --> 01:29:17,190
but just because they came to that
conclusion doesn't mean that their

1433
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:18,540
assumptions were all correct.

1434
01:29:18,541 --> 01:29:23,220
And that's why you also need to have
enough thick skin to know when to like,

1435
01:29:23,680 --> 01:29:27,750
um, when to be a little bit dismissive
or not listen to everything.

1436
01:29:28,170 --> 01:29:30,030
Um,
uh,

1437
01:29:30,180 --> 01:29:35,160
and part of what helps with that is having
conviction and conviction that comes

1438
01:29:35,161 --> 01:29:38,760
from being able to think
from first principles, um,

1439
01:29:39,030 --> 01:29:41,180
and pay less attention
to people's conclusions.

1440
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:44,670
Let the outputs of people's conclusions
as much as the inputs into those

1441
01:29:44,671 --> 01:29:49,200
conclusions. So what does that
mean? Well, people said that, okay,

1442
01:29:49,201 --> 01:29:52,290
the Dropbox is not gonna be successful
because if people try to in a million

1443
01:29:52,291 --> 01:29:55,140
times, um, and that is,

1444
01:29:55,170 --> 01:29:58,530
that is true in anybody who that's
like factually true. It's not,

1445
01:29:58,531 --> 01:30:01,320
you can't debate that. Um, but that
would have been true for mobile.

1446
01:30:01,321 --> 01:30:02,460
Like every phone,

1447
01:30:02,490 --> 01:30:06,810
every mobile thing before the iPhone
or every mobile software company,

1448
01:30:06,811 --> 01:30:10,380
every APP like was a total failure
before the iPhone world changes.

1449
01:30:10,381 --> 01:30:13,660
Suddenly it's the right time. And so, um,

1450
01:30:13,710 --> 01:30:16,890
if you study history of technology or
history business, you realize, okay,

1451
01:30:16,891 --> 01:30:21,420
that that argument is not in
and of itself. Um, causal. Um,

1452
01:30:21,540 --> 01:30:25,110
so the, the, what you want to answer is
like a why is that incorrect? It's like,

1453
01:30:25,111 --> 01:30:29,760
well, actually, um, there, there
are a lot of good ideas that are,

1454
01:30:29,870 --> 01:30:31,920
are bad ideas for awhile
because the timing is wrong.

1455
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:34,770
But then at the time he becomes right
because of some discontinuity in tech and

1456
01:30:34,771 --> 01:30:35,604
like then,

1457
01:30:35,610 --> 01:30:39,600
and what's like the innovator's
dilemma or others will illustrate that.

1458
01:30:39,601 --> 01:30:41,910
And so if you really understand these,

1459
01:30:42,030 --> 01:30:45,120
if you understand that that's why it's
important to build these mental models

1460
01:30:45,121 --> 01:30:46,110
because you were like,
all right,

1461
01:30:46,170 --> 01:30:49,990
this is my framework for how the world
works and I keep refining it. Um,

1462
01:30:50,070 --> 01:30:52,860
what these people are missing.
The key conclusion from that,

1463
01:30:52,861 --> 01:30:55,560
that just because something has
happened like has failed before,

1464
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:59,310
it doesn't mean it will always feel in
the future, can still fail. But, um,

1465
01:31:00,090 --> 01:31:04,890
but that kind of conviction came from an
understanding or a belief and a f and a

1466
01:31:04,891 --> 01:31:07,050
worldview and framework of like,
here's how,

1467
01:31:07,080 --> 01:31:10,560
here's how I think business
works or here's how to think
about an idea like ours.

1468
01:31:11,130 --> 01:31:14,670
Um, so, but that said, it's not.

1469
01:31:14,920 --> 01:31:16,740
So I think there's a,

1470
01:31:16,770 --> 01:31:20,610
how do you receive advice and how do
you sort of develop first principles

1471
01:31:20,611 --> 01:31:21,540
thinking,
which we talked about,

1472
01:31:21,541 --> 01:31:24,180
but then like that doesn't make it feel
any better when people that like your

1473
01:31:24,181 --> 01:31:26,170
idea socks and you're going to fail,
um,

1474
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:30,450
or worse that like you are
stupid or you're an elite. Yeah.

1475
01:31:30,510 --> 01:31:34,440
At Super Ad Hominem, right?
Um, yeah, people are not.

1476
01:31:35,370 --> 01:31:39,450
So, first of all, I think you have to
have a sense of like this is normal.

1477
01:31:39,690 --> 01:31:43,290
I'm like, do it. Just don't take it too
personal. Like, cause that's the thing,

1478
01:31:43,291 --> 01:31:45,900
you know, you want to take
it, you do want to take,

1479
01:31:45,930 --> 01:31:50,430
you want to receive the feedback and
like try to extract the kernel of that's

1480
01:31:50,431 --> 01:31:55,080
useful from it but not feel obligated to,
to accept the whole thing.

1481
01:31:55,710 --> 01:31:59,800
Um,
I think more broadly you have to,

1482
01:32:00,490 --> 01:32:03,580
whether it's getting criticism
or just a lot of the things,

1483
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:06,550
I think one of the harder things about
running the company in general was I just

1484
01:32:06,551 --> 01:32:09,520
remember being in the beginning
being like, oh my God.

1485
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:12,800
Like all right now we,
uh,

1486
01:32:13,510 --> 01:32:16,300
like sequoia has decided to invest in,
in our comp against the odds.

1487
01:32:16,330 --> 01:32:18,480
Now Sequoia has decided to invest there.

1488
01:32:18,500 --> 01:32:21,400
They're writing us a check for $1 million.

1489
01:32:22,510 --> 01:32:25,390
I hope they realize that.
Like I've never, I've not,

1490
01:32:25,391 --> 01:32:29,980
I haven't really done this before. And
like, Oh God, like that million dollar,

1491
01:32:29,981 --> 01:32:32,740
it's great to kind of cash that check.
But whoa man,

1492
01:32:32,741 --> 01:32:36,010
they're going to be looking for
that money back at some point. Like,

1493
01:32:36,011 --> 01:32:40,300
what are we going to do? Um, and
so that's not, that wasn't the,

1494
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:43,990
I mean there were probably a lot of things
going on in my head at the time, but,

1495
01:32:44,260 --> 01:32:47,410
and then like, oh my God, I've never
really built a successful company for,

1496
01:32:47,411 --> 01:32:50,110
I don't, I've never manage
people really, you know,

1497
01:32:50,111 --> 01:32:53,680
the idea of Dropbox being at a hundred
person company is like terrifying.

1498
01:32:53,681 --> 01:32:54,160
Like I'm,

1499
01:32:54,160 --> 01:32:57,850
this treadmill is just going to go faster
and faster until like I'm violently

1500
01:32:57,851 --> 01:33:02,320
thrown off of it. Like, how am
I going to deal with that? Um,

1501
01:33:03,460 --> 01:33:06,520
and, and a lot of me also felt
like, okay, well I'll just be like,

1502
01:33:06,670 --> 01:33:10,930
build the company until it's
like successful enough or
makes enough money where

1503
01:33:10,931 --> 01:33:13,080
I just don't have to worry about money
anymore. And then I had like, uh,

1504
01:33:13,830 --> 01:33:17,170
like as soon as I get to that, I don't
know, this was like some kind of theory.

1505
01:33:17,171 --> 01:33:19,240
I'm like, all right, as soon as
I get to that level of success,

1506
01:33:19,241 --> 01:33:22,900
I'll just stop and like, just
when will screw it up. Um,

1507
01:33:22,901 --> 01:33:26,500
but then interestingly that the fat
goalpost kept moving back and moving back

1508
01:33:26,501 --> 01:33:31,180
and moving back because I think it's,
it's never really been about the money,

1509
01:33:31,181 --> 01:33:34,840
but you can read in the y Combinator
application, like that's now public.

1510
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:37,890
We put that out there and I'm
like, I would, I would like,

1511
01:33:37,900 --> 01:33:42,130
I would if I had $1 million after taxes,
F for six months of work,

1512
01:33:42,131 --> 01:33:46,390
I consider that a pretty
good deal. Um, so, um,

1513
01:33:47,680 --> 01:33:50,500
so, but, but, but, but more on the,
the, the, the more I'm just like,

1514
01:33:50,570 --> 01:33:53,980
what do you do when you're like, oh my
God, this is like pretty uncomfortable.

1515
01:33:53,981 --> 01:33:58,770
I've never done anything like this
before. Um, I might screw it up. You need,

1516
01:33:58,810 --> 01:34:02,140
so your instinct will to be to,
um,

1517
01:34:02,710 --> 01:34:06,940
run away from that feeling and what you
need to learn to do is run towards it

1518
01:34:08,380 --> 01:34:11,860
because that's just going to keep, keep
happening, keep happening. Like, you know,

1519
01:34:11,861 --> 01:34:13,590
we're going to drive a show up at
this guy's house. I don't know.

1520
01:34:13,710 --> 01:34:15,670
Maybe we'll get arrested. I don't
know. But we're going to do it.

1521
01:34:16,360 --> 01:34:21,130
I don't think that's the best example. Uh,
there's so many things where it's like,

1522
01:34:21,131 --> 01:34:25,720
you just gotta Kinda figure it
out and keep going. Um, and Ben,

1523
01:34:25,780 --> 01:34:30,010
one of the great things from
that that Ben wrote in his book,

1524
01:34:30,040 --> 01:34:33,190
the hard thing about hard things is the
hardest part of being a CEO is managing

1525
01:34:33,191 --> 01:34:37,900
your psychology. Um, and I didn't
really know what that meant at the time.

1526
01:34:37,930 --> 01:34:39,940
I think I have a much better sense now.

1527
01:34:39,941 --> 01:34:44,540
So I think first thing is getting
comfortable with being uncomfortable, um,

1528
01:34:44,590 --> 01:34:48,430
because, and, and you think about
principles like Ray Dalio, his book,

1529
01:34:48,760 --> 01:34:51,690
he's like pain plus reflection
equals progress. Uh,

1530
01:34:51,940 --> 01:34:54,280
people love the progress
part or they love growth,

1531
01:34:54,281 --> 01:34:57,190
but they don't love the pain part and
they don't bother to do the reflection

1532
01:34:57,200 --> 01:34:59,690
part. So, um, uh,

1533
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:02,330
so understanding that that isn't in the
sort of zooming out and understanding,

1534
01:35:02,331 --> 01:35:04,880
like depersonalized it, it's
like, it's not really you.

1535
01:35:04,881 --> 01:35:06,530
This is just like the process of growth.

1536
01:35:06,531 --> 01:35:11,510
It will be painful or think
of your journey as more of
an adventure rather than

1537
01:35:11,511 --> 01:35:15,050
like a final exam where you have to get
everything right and you only got one

1538
01:35:15,051 --> 01:35:17,690
shot. Um, I think that's,
that's pretty important.

1539
01:35:17,691 --> 01:35:21,660
And then second is all right,
you have to, now it's, it's,

1540
01:35:22,160 --> 01:35:24,560
everybody likes the idea of
growth and pushing yourself,

1541
01:35:24,561 --> 01:35:27,960
but you also have to take
care of yourself. Like, um,

1542
01:35:28,070 --> 01:35:32,660
you have to find ways to metabolize
stress and avoid burnout.

1543
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:36,560
Um,
and for some reason people just,

1544
01:35:36,950 --> 01:35:41,810
they just use the one tool of like pushing
themselves harder and then they break.

1545
01:35:42,230 --> 01:35:45,470
Um, and you know, you
wouldn't do that to your car.

1546
01:35:45,471 --> 01:35:47,420
You wouldn't do that with
like a musical instrument.

1547
01:35:47,870 --> 01:35:50,750
So why would you do that
to yourself? Right. So,

1548
01:35:51,380 --> 01:35:53,150
um, just to, just to pause for a second,

1549
01:35:53,230 --> 01:35:58,070
like I recall very distinctly every time
we've stayed at the same hotel or been

1550
01:35:58,071 --> 01:36:00,230
at the same event and
I've gone to the gym,

1551
01:36:00,920 --> 01:36:05,120
I've almost always seen you in the gym.
Uh,

1552
01:36:05,150 --> 01:36:08,540
I mean it seems like you have,
just as a component of that,

1553
01:36:08,580 --> 01:36:13,340
a physical practice to care
for the machine, so to speak.

1554
01:36:13,990 --> 01:36:17,560
Yeah. I wouldn't say I'm the best
like athlete by any stretch, but I,

1555
01:36:17,710 --> 01:36:21,070
but it's really important that you have
to do enough so that you don't break

1556
01:36:21,071 --> 01:36:25,810
down. Um, and so, and, and you've got
to figure out what that is for you. And,

1557
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:29,990
um, and I know that's something
you really care about and, and the,

1558
01:36:30,300 --> 01:36:32,860
the advice that you have to offer your
readers is gonna be a much better than

1559
01:36:32,861 --> 01:36:35,680
whatever advice I have a,
but you need to do something,

1560
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:39,740
some kind of routine and stick to
it. Um, but just the basics of the,

1561
01:36:39,770 --> 01:36:43,240
I think some of the stoop, the dumbest
advice that people get is like, you know,

1562
01:36:43,241 --> 01:36:45,530
not sleeping or wearing like,

1563
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:49,990
or just pursuing this idea that that
successful people somehow work like 70,

1564
01:36:49,991 --> 01:36:54,610
80 hour weeks and that's the norm. Um,
there are a number of problems with that.

1565
01:36:54,610 --> 01:36:55,960
First,
it's like usually not true.

1566
01:36:56,090 --> 01:36:59,800
It's usually more of an indication that
person's either lack of awareness about

1567
01:36:59,801 --> 01:37:04,150
where they're spending their time or
a lack of effectiveness if they need.

1568
01:37:04,810 --> 01:37:08,980
Um, if their only tool in the shed
is like work more hours. Right.

1569
01:37:09,010 --> 01:37:13,150
Because just think about that,
like, you know, there that that is,

1570
01:37:13,151 --> 01:37:15,610
that has a ceiling in terms of how much
of an advantage that can give you. Like,

1571
01:37:15,611 --> 01:37:20,470
yes, you want to work hard. Um,
but if you're only advantages,

1572
01:37:20,471 --> 01:37:24,790
like being able to work 20% more hours
than someone who's merely very committed,

1573
01:37:25,390 --> 01:37:29,950
then you're not going to have outsized
results. And you also, I mean there's,

1574
01:37:29,951 --> 01:37:31,600
so there's, I have a, I have a,

1575
01:37:32,570 --> 01:37:36,190
I think this meme that
people that successful people
work a hundred hour weeks

1576
01:37:36,191 --> 01:37:40,880
or something is, is both
false and super harmful. Um,

1577
01:37:40,900 --> 01:37:44,980
most of the, most, the most successful
people I know actually work. I mean they,

1578
01:37:45,110 --> 01:37:46,570
they've crunched times
where they're super busy,

1579
01:37:46,571 --> 01:37:51,160
but they otherwise have a workweek
that looks more normal than not. Um,

1580
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:53,780
and so that, that was something
I didn't realize when I was,

1581
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:58,080
when I was starting out. But the
basics of sleep, eating well, self,

1582
01:37:58,081 --> 01:38:01,650
self care, exercise,
putting it on your calendar,

1583
01:38:01,651 --> 01:38:05,220
not just wishful thinking and hoping
it'll sort of happen in the spare moments.

1584
01:38:05,221 --> 01:38:08,600
Like if you can't see, um,
these things on your case,

1585
01:38:08,601 --> 01:38:10,080
if you can't see your
priorities in your calendar,

1586
01:38:10,081 --> 01:38:14,770
if you can't see your gym time on the
calendar, it doesn't exist. I'm totally,

1587
01:38:14,940 --> 01:38:17,640
so, uh, and then,

1588
01:38:18,690 --> 01:38:20,340
and then I think like self awareness,

1589
01:38:20,660 --> 01:38:22,070
there's probably a lot more
we could talk about how to,

1590
01:38:22,180 --> 01:38:25,920
how to metabolize stress
and avoid burnout.

1591
01:38:26,550 --> 01:38:29,180
But I think having that
taken care of the basics,

1592
01:38:29,181 --> 01:38:33,510
like having a good foundation and setting
healthy boundaries is pretty important.

1593
01:38:33,510 --> 01:38:35,850
And having a sustainable workload,
um,

1594
01:38:36,690 --> 01:38:41,690
the self awareness is pretty important
and being willing to like shine a hard

1595
01:38:42,181 --> 01:38:46,920
light on yourself, um, and
embracing that. So for me,

1596
01:38:46,950 --> 01:38:48,450
coaching has been super helpful.

1597
01:38:48,950 --> 01:38:51,390
A coaching meaning you have
like an executive coach.

1598
01:38:51,630 --> 01:38:56,090
I've had different ones over
time. Um, and, and, and,

1599
01:38:56,110 --> 01:38:59,230
and really like I go through the
experience, I'm like, Oh God,

1600
01:38:59,250 --> 01:39:02,300
I'll give this a shot. So
my friends have had, um,

1601
01:39:03,320 --> 01:39:07,950
I have spoken positively about it.
Um, but it's a little, it's um,

1602
01:39:08,490 --> 01:39:09,980
well I'll say this first part.

1603
01:39:10,170 --> 01:39:12,510
I remember my first coaching
experience and like getting,

1604
01:39:12,511 --> 01:39:15,390
they do the three 60 and then you sit
down and you do your review of your

1605
01:39:15,391 --> 01:39:17,070
results. So, sorry to pause.

1606
01:39:17,071 --> 01:39:21,870
The three 60 for people who don't
know is where you have any superiors,

1607
01:39:21,900 --> 01:39:25,260
peers, employees, et Cetera,
people who know you really well,

1608
01:39:25,620 --> 01:39:29,430
interviewed about your
strengths, weaknesses and so
on. Would you, is that fair?

1609
01:39:29,440 --> 01:39:31,950
Is that fair to say? Yeah. Well you get
all this feedback from all of these,

1610
01:39:32,010 --> 01:39:35,820
you know, everybody you were closely work
with, so it's kind of overwhelming, um,

1611
01:39:36,350 --> 01:39:41,220
cause you get a lot of it.
Um, and it's not all good.

1612
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:45,840
So, uh, and actually to this day,

1613
01:39:45,841 --> 01:39:49,380
like opening those documents and like
reading all the free 60 feedback is one of

1614
01:39:49,381 --> 01:39:53,110
the most painful like human
experiences you can have. Um,

1615
01:39:53,190 --> 01:39:57,630
maybe that's a little hyperbolic but,
but it's not fun. It's at least not fun.

1616
01:39:58,140 --> 01:40:02,190
It's not something I look forward
to. Um, but it's important. So, um,

1617
01:40:02,580 --> 01:40:03,570
because you need to know,

1618
01:40:03,571 --> 01:40:06,210
like it's much better to just like know
and being able to do something about it.

1619
01:40:06,211 --> 01:40:10,860
Like Act. Then Ben, Ben's been a
great friend and mentor and he's like,

1620
01:40:11,190 --> 01:40:14,460
he was reflecting, he told me a quote
that one of his mentors told him,

1621
01:40:14,461 --> 01:40:18,990
which is that God gave us all weaknesses.
It's a blessing to find out about them.

1622
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:25,500
Yeah. You know, sobering. You know? Um,

1623
01:40:26,010 --> 01:40:28,020
uh, but so, but, but I went through the,

1624
01:40:28,021 --> 01:40:31,290
I just remember my first coaching
experience briefly, like, you know,

1625
01:40:31,300 --> 01:40:33,450
sit you down and they're like,
first page is usually like,

1626
01:40:33,451 --> 01:40:37,380
here are your strengths. And I'm like,
okay. He's like, my coach was like,

1627
01:40:37,381 --> 01:40:41,490
you are really good. You really,
really care about people.

1628
01:40:41,491 --> 01:40:44,730
You love building great relationships. And
I'm like, Yep, okay. Yeah, that sounds,

1629
01:40:44,731 --> 01:40:48,600
that sounds good. Um, you're really
creative. You like new ideas. I'm like,

1630
01:40:49,200 --> 01:40:54,190
all right, I'm enjoying this
coaching thing so far. He's like,

1631
01:40:54,191 --> 01:40:55,450
you're really comfortable in chaos.

1632
01:40:55,451 --> 01:40:58,150
Like it doesn't bother you that this
stuff is like so crazy. I'm like, Yup.

1633
01:40:58,600 --> 01:41:02,740
It's like, okay, Duh, Duh, Duh. And then
flip to the next page. All right. Now,

1634
01:41:02,780 --> 01:41:05,810
like it's never weaknesses,
development areas. That's right.

1635
01:41:05,830 --> 01:41:09,190
Or operating opportunities are to
improve it. So something like, all right,

1636
01:41:09,540 --> 01:41:12,970
let's hear about some
opportunities. Um, he's like,

1637
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:18,000
you are really conflict
avoidant. Um, you don't, uh,

1638
01:41:18,040 --> 01:41:22,230
make hard people decisions. Uh,
people don't know what you do,

1639
01:41:22,231 --> 01:41:26,620
but like where they stand.
I'm like, okay. He's like, ah,

1640
01:41:26,621 --> 01:41:30,850
you're unreliable. You drop,
you drop balls, um, uh,

1641
01:41:30,870 --> 01:41:34,150
you're not paying enough attention to
the things that are important. I'm like,

1642
01:41:34,200 --> 01:41:38,440
okay. And he's like, and
you suck at planning. Uh,

1643
01:41:38,570 --> 01:41:43,570
if people are confused about what to do,
and I'm like, okay. And then he's like,

1644
01:41:43,571 --> 01:41:46,360
look, okay, you're good with people. So,

1645
01:41:46,361 --> 01:41:50,260
and you like people to be happy.
So you avoid conflict.

1646
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:53,350
You are creative. You like
new ideas, so you don't view,

1647
01:41:53,351 --> 01:41:56,440
don't pay attention to the routine stuff.
You're comfortable in chaos.

1648
01:41:56,441 --> 01:41:59,980
So you don't plan like these strengths
are all like their own weaknesses and

1649
01:41:59,981 --> 01:42:02,770
disguise. Like, um, so,

1650
01:42:03,160 --> 01:42:06,460
and there's no one who's like 10 out of
10 on everything. And that's, that's why,

1651
01:42:07,060 --> 01:42:09,700
um, so, you know,

1652
01:42:09,701 --> 01:42:12,490
there's a lot different philosophies
on what do you do as a feedback and you

1653
01:42:12,491 --> 01:42:14,140
know,
the play more your shanks 30th,

1654
01:42:14,440 --> 01:42:16,540
I think you need at least to get your
weaknesses to a point where they're not

1655
01:42:16,541 --> 01:42:18,460
like destroying the company.
Um,

1656
01:42:18,490 --> 01:42:21,070
but generally you want to play to your
strengths and that's one of the key

1657
01:42:21,071 --> 01:42:25,570
effective executive tenants.
Um, but other than that,

1658
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:28,250
uh,
and I think just sell foreign,

1659
01:42:28,260 --> 01:42:32,440
like trying to understand yourself on
all kinds of different dimensions is

1660
01:42:32,441 --> 01:42:36,460
really valuable. And I talked
about the Enneagram, uh,

1661
01:42:36,610 --> 01:42:39,580
in your book. Uh, and
that's, it's sort of like,

1662
01:42:39,790 --> 01:42:41,890
I would call it like
a useful Myers Briggs.

1663
01:42:42,330 --> 01:42:46,750
So most people are familiar with Myers
Briggs. It's a personality typing system,

1664
01:42:46,751 --> 01:42:49,450
but then you read it and it's like reading
a personality quiz on the Internet.

1665
01:42:49,451 --> 01:42:51,880
You've sort of, you remember he had some
letters and there's like some stuff,

1666
01:42:51,881 --> 01:42:54,070
but you don't actually
do anything with it. Uh,

1667
01:42:54,130 --> 01:42:56,800
I found enneagram to be
similar in terms of it's, uh,

1668
01:42:56,980 --> 01:42:58,900
there are a limited number
of personality types,

1669
01:42:59,440 --> 01:43:02,600
but it's much more of a theory about what
fundamentally motivates people, what,

1670
01:43:02,601 --> 01:43:06,610
what demotivates them. Um, and so, uh,

1671
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,190
I know we don't have a ton of time,
so I'd just say like, check it out.

1672
01:43:09,191 --> 01:43:13,120
Enneagram is very valuable. Like I do
it. My Tea, I was, I was super skeptical.

1673
01:43:13,121 --> 01:43:17,650
I was like, this sounds like a
cult. Um, and it kind of is. But,

1674
01:43:17,710 --> 01:43:22,050
um, it's been very helpful
both to do individually and
with your team because it,

1675
01:43:22,051 --> 01:43:25,900
it just, you sort of, what you
learn is like, okay, here are the,

1676
01:43:25,901 --> 01:43:28,330
here are my blind spots. I was
like, I'm an enneagram seventh.

1677
01:43:28,450 --> 01:43:32,380
These are like totally textbook strengths
and weaknesses of a seven that they

1678
01:43:32,381 --> 01:43:35,530
like. They like new things.
They like, uh, they're,

1679
01:43:35,531 --> 01:43:37,630
they're comfortable and came on in chaos,

1680
01:43:37,720 --> 01:43:42,400
but then they can become distracted
and, and you know, and unreliable, um,

1681
01:43:43,090 --> 01:43:44,350
conflict of way and things like that.

1682
01:43:44,350 --> 01:43:46,540
So it just knowing you
always one way or another,

1683
01:43:46,541 --> 01:43:50,290
you always want to have an accurate map
of like, what do you need to work on? Um,

1684
01:43:50,710 --> 01:43:55,040
how were you, how were you
introduced to Enneagram? Well,

1685
01:43:55,041 --> 01:43:56,930
so it's through my cofounder.
Uh,

1686
01:43:56,960 --> 01:44:00,750
but then Mirage was introduced to
it through a guy named Gentry who,

1687
01:44:00,780 --> 01:44:05,150
who was the founder of mailbox, who
worked with us for a, for a while, says,

1688
01:44:05,260 --> 01:44:08,360
you know, call it three or four
years ago. And then Ross was like,

1689
01:44:08,361 --> 01:44:10,670
you're going to love this. It's
great that it. Ah, and I'm like,

1690
01:44:10,671 --> 01:44:15,410
it sounds super weird. Um, but he was
right. So it's, it's been super helpful.

1691
01:44:16,620 --> 01:44:17,131
Awesome.
Well,

1692
01:44:17,131 --> 01:44:21,060
I know we don't have a ton of time left
and maybe sometime we'll do a follow up

1693
01:44:21,210 --> 01:44:25,260
with some wine and I'd love to talk to
you more about your cadence and so on

1694
01:44:25,261 --> 01:44:28,770
with an executive coach. Maybe we can
get to it another time, but I thought,

1695
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:33,800
I thought we could wrap up with another
thing that you mentioned in the book,

1696
01:44:33,811 --> 01:44:36,480
you know, tribe of mentors, but
I'd love to hear you talk about it,

1697
01:44:37,140 --> 01:44:42,140
which is the tennis ball
circle and the number 30,000.

1698
01:44:43,110 --> 01:44:46,380
Can you tell us where this
comes from and what that means?

1699
01:44:46,820 --> 01:44:47,800
Sure. So, uh,

1700
01:44:47,801 --> 01:44:52,190
I did the commencement
speech for Mit back in 2013.

1701
01:44:52,850 --> 01:44:56,800
Um,
and I was like,

1702
01:44:56,810 --> 01:45:00,050
the whole premise was I'm like, all
right, what do I got? I'm like, I'm 30.

1703
01:45:00,051 --> 01:45:03,440
I don't really like, I'm a Chi. Wait
20 years. I'll say something like,

1704
01:45:03,441 --> 01:45:08,330
way more insightful then. But I'm like,
all right, well, I kind of, the prompt,

1705
01:45:08,540 --> 01:45:10,790
the prompt I came up with was like,
well, what do I wish I had known?

1706
01:45:10,791 --> 01:45:13,340
What would I tell my 23 year old self?
Um,

1707
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:17,120
and if I could sort of send a cheat sheet
back in time, what would it have on it?

1708
01:45:17,121 --> 01:45:21,470
And what I would put on that little cheat
sheet is a, as you said, a tennis ball,

1709
01:45:21,471 --> 01:45:24,070
a circle and the number 30,000. So, um,

1710
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:28,640
the tennis ball is really about finding
that thing you can become obsessed with.

1711
01:45:28,641 --> 01:45:32,180
And so when I think about like Dropbox
or even just other side projects,

1712
01:45:32,181 --> 01:45:33,110
like the Poker Bot,

1713
01:45:33,111 --> 01:45:37,970
like I am both most productive and
happiest and most successful. And like,

1714
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:41,300
it's like when all those things line up
or when the thing you're obsessed with

1715
01:45:41,870 --> 01:45:46,700
overlaps with something, the world
really needs, um, uh, or values. So,

1716
01:45:47,090 --> 01:45:51,340
um, but, but like don't saddle, like find
something that, uh, the tennis ball was,

1717
01:45:51,350 --> 01:45:53,750
sorry. The, what is it, where
does the tennis ball come from?

1718
01:45:54,200 --> 01:45:58,550
I had this like really
lazy fat dog growing up.

1719
01:45:59,450 --> 01:46:02,870
Um, who would, uh,

1720
01:46:03,170 --> 01:46:06,140
but when you showed her food
or you showed her tennis ball,

1721
01:46:06,680 --> 01:46:11,450
she would be just to, to
just like go nuts. Um,

1722
01:46:11,540 --> 01:46:15,430
and so you throw a tennis ball for it.
So it was like, she just as like this,

1723
01:46:16,440 --> 01:46:21,350
it was like watching like,
like ham running on twigs or something.

1724
01:46:21,360 --> 01:46:25,790
You're like, it's like
super, it's just bizarre.

1725
01:46:25,791 --> 01:46:28,640
It's just funny. Like, and so
I was like, I, I'm, I'm like,

1726
01:46:28,940 --> 01:46:32,530
what you want is to have like
that ridiculous expression
on your face and just

1727
01:46:32,531 --> 01:46:35,510
got to kind of be so obsessed with
something that you just don't care about

1728
01:46:35,511 --> 01:46:38,710
anything else. Not overdo it,
but like, but the point is like,

1729
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:42,010
find something that I'm not
just passionate about, but
like that, just like that,

1730
01:46:42,011 --> 01:46:43,490
that,
that you can become obsessed with and,

1731
01:46:43,491 --> 01:46:46,400
and just really love and something you
would do even if you weren't, you know,

1732
01:46:46,460 --> 01:46:50,850
even if I want your job. Um, then
the circle concept is really,

1733
01:46:51,060 --> 01:46:54,600
there's a saying by a guy
named Jim Rone that you're,

1734
01:46:54,601 --> 01:46:58,330
you're an average of the five people
you spend the most time with. Um,

1735
01:46:58,560 --> 01:47:01,890
and I found that to be super true. So,
and then, so the, and the upshot is like,

1736
01:47:01,891 --> 01:47:02,910
chooses to choose wisely.

1737
01:47:02,911 --> 01:47:05,430
So whether that's the literal five people
you spend the most time with or just

1738
01:47:05,431 --> 01:47:09,120
in the environment you end. So being, um,

1739
01:47:09,390 --> 01:47:13,800
like going to a or just find
an environment that will
pull the best out of you.

1740
01:47:14,250 --> 01:47:17,910
Um, and so, and I think
that's been true for me.

1741
01:47:17,940 --> 01:47:22,050
Going to MIT really taught me like
what a good engineer looks like.

1742
01:47:22,620 --> 01:47:23,340
Um,

1743
01:47:23,340 --> 01:47:27,540
and it's both inspiring in
terms of watching all these
people who are super like

1744
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:31,170
capable, but then also you get jealous
and you're like, oh, I, you know,

1745
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:34,620
I want to be that good and see you want
to harness that kind of negative energy

1746
01:47:34,680 --> 01:47:37,920
and to pushing yourself to work harder.
So, and that's what that was true.

1747
01:47:37,921 --> 01:47:41,730
Whether it's school or being in
y Combinator with other founders,

1748
01:47:41,731 --> 01:47:45,000
like friendly competition there or with
my friends who were starting companies,

1749
01:47:45,180 --> 01:47:49,740
being in San Francisco, all of
those contributed massively to, um,

1750
01:47:50,250 --> 01:47:54,990
to us, uh, to us making it. Um,
and then finally, 30,000, uh,

1751
01:47:54,991 --> 01:47:58,290
is, is, is really about, do you
have everybody lives on average,

1752
01:47:58,620 --> 01:48:03,420
humans live on average for 30,000
days. I was at first, I was like,

1753
01:48:04,260 --> 01:48:08,430
okay, yes, this is like a clinical
truth. Not terribly interesting. Um,

1754
01:48:08,460 --> 01:48:12,210
because I think I had just moved to San
Francisco and as an a and I was just

1755
01:48:12,211 --> 01:48:15,030
like, I couldn't sleep. So I was just
like on the Internet reading stuff.

1756
01:48:15,660 --> 01:48:19,710
And I came to, became across that and
I remember being like, Huh, okay. Um,

1757
01:48:20,040 --> 01:48:24,060
and I opened the calculator and I'm
like, all right, I'm 24 at the time,

1758
01:48:24,061 --> 01:48:27,240
24 times three, 65. I'm like, Oh my
God, I'm like already 8,000 days now.

1759
01:48:29,070 --> 01:48:29,520
Um,

1760
01:48:29,520 --> 01:48:33,480
so this idea of like life unfolding
infinitely in front of you is actually not

1761
01:48:33,481 --> 01:48:35,250
really true.
Um,

1762
01:48:35,310 --> 01:48:40,140
and so it's really important to not just
make everyday count but also understand

1763
01:48:40,141 --> 01:48:40,681
that like,

1764
01:48:40,681 --> 01:48:45,681
think of life more as an adventure or a
story more than how you think about life

1765
01:48:46,321 --> 01:48:48,180
as when you're graduating college,

1766
01:48:48,181 --> 01:48:53,160
which is like their life up until you
graduate college is just like a series of

1767
01:48:53,161 --> 01:48:57,480
checking off boxes and like getting
ready for stuff and performing. Um,

1768
01:48:58,050 --> 01:49:01,350
and all of your worldly
achievements can be,

1769
01:49:01,351 --> 01:49:06,060
are averaged into a GPA. And so every
mistake is like brings that number down.

1770
01:49:06,061 --> 01:49:07,890
And like it's something you
have to like obsess over.

1771
01:49:08,340 --> 01:49:11,010
And then college graduations the first
day where that's not really true anymore.

1772
01:49:11,011 --> 01:49:13,710
You don't really have a GPA anymore
and you're not an average of all your

1773
01:49:13,711 --> 01:49:18,690
successes and failures. Like you
should change your mindset to life.

1774
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:22,530
And also just think of it more just
making a story that's interesting,

1775
01:49:22,531 --> 01:49:26,730
not just not trying to be perfect because
I think that's a trap that a lot of

1776
01:49:26,731 --> 01:49:31,710
people fall into. So anyway, those are
when I thought about, um, you know,

1777
01:49:32,820 --> 01:49:35,940
if you were to play everything
over again a hundred times,

1778
01:49:35,941 --> 01:49:39,000
who knows what would happen. But if
I could just hand back a cheat sheet,

1779
01:49:39,030 --> 01:49:40,440
that's what I would put on it.

1780
01:49:42,180 --> 01:49:46,350
That's who you'd put a tennis ball
circle and the number of 30,000.

1781
01:49:47,320 --> 01:49:48,040
Well,
drew,

1782
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:50,900
I know you have a very, very busy, uh,

1783
01:49:51,130 --> 01:49:53,800
time ahead of you and I'm
sure today's no exception,

1784
01:49:53,801 --> 01:49:58,480
so it'll let you get back to your day.
But do you have any closing comments?

1785
01:49:58,481 --> 01:49:59,980
Asks,
uh,

1786
01:49:59,981 --> 01:50:04,660
suggestions or anything else for
people who are listening to this?

1787
01:50:04,661 --> 01:50:09,600
Any, any kind of parting
comments before we wrap up? Uh,

1788
01:50:09,670 --> 01:50:12,540
let's see. So I, um,

1789
01:50:13,900 --> 01:50:17,500
I think I just don't, don't, don't forget
to have like don't forget to have fun.

1790
01:50:17,501 --> 01:50:21,670
And like I said, I think at the, at
the end of it you want to have like,

1791
01:50:23,310 --> 01:50:23,830
okay,

1792
01:50:23,830 --> 01:50:26,040
there's an obsession
with avoiding failure.

1793
01:50:26,100 --> 01:50:30,840
And if you think of it more as the
failures aren't really that important,

1794
01:50:30,841 --> 01:50:34,710
it's more how you respond
and even like what you,

1795
01:50:34,711 --> 01:50:37,560
what you want to do is
write an interesting story.
Not like a perfect story.

1796
01:50:38,710 --> 01:50:39,040
Okay.

1797
01:50:39,040 --> 01:50:43,670
Yes, yes. And I mean, the
first thing they do with it,

1798
01:50:43,770 --> 01:50:45,640
well,
I shouldn't say the sort of definitively,

1799
01:50:45,641 --> 01:50:48,040
but it's like a lot of screenwriters
who are experienced, we'll,

1800
01:50:48,041 --> 01:50:50,380
we'll say you have to create characters

1801
01:50:51,930 --> 01:50:56,930
and the protagonist who on some level
the audience really cares about and then

1802
01:50:57,491 --> 01:51:01,140
torture them and then they come
out the other side will like it.

1803
01:51:01,150 --> 01:51:05,980
That is one of the recipes for writing.
It's successful screenplay. And, uh,

1804
01:51:06,010 --> 01:51:07,510
you know,
if you're part of the human condition,

1805
01:51:07,511 --> 01:51:12,250
it seems like that is going to be a
component I w one way or the other.

1806
01:51:12,280 --> 01:51:14,800
Uh, well drew, thank you
so much for the time.

1807
01:51:14,890 --> 01:51:18,610
I always enjoy chatting
and hopefully we get to uh,

1808
01:51:18,910 --> 01:51:20,530

1811

everybody listening we will have links

Hey guys, this is Tim again.

1818
01:51:51,881 --> 01:51:55,030
Just a few more things before
you take off. Number one,

1819
01:51:55,300 --> 01:52:00,190
this is five bullet Friday.
Do you want to get a short email from me?

1820
01:52:00,250 --> 01:52:02,860
Would you enjoy getting a short
email from me every Friday?

01:52:03,310 --> 01:52:07,390
That provides a little more soul of
fun before the weekend and five bullet

1822
01:52:07,391 --> 01:52:12,010
Friday is a very short email where I share
the coolest things I've found or that

1823
01:52:12,011 --> 01:52:13,570
I've been pondering over the week.

1824
01:52:13,840 --> 01:52:16,570
That could include favorite new
albums that I've discovered.

1825
01:52:16,571 --> 01:52:20,050
It could include Gizmos and gadgets
and all sorts of weird shit that I've

1826
01:52:20,051 --> 01:52:24,340
somehow dug up in the other,
the world of the esoteric as I do.

1827
01:52:24,640 --> 01:52:29,640
It could include favorite articles that
I've read and that I've shared with my

1828
01:52:30,310 --> 01:52:33,010
close friends for instance,
and it's very short.

1829
01:52:33,100 --> 01:52:38,080
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness
