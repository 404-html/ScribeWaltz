1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,810
Optimal, minimal. At this altitude,

2
00:00:02,811 --> 00:00:06,020
I can run flat out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,450
I'm a cybernetic organism living tissue.

00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:25,750

00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,750
This episode is brought
to you by Wealthfront.

26
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,270
Wealthfront is the future
of financial advice.

27
00:01:43,271 --> 00:01:47,680
They become incredibly popular among my
friends in silicon valley and across the

28
00:01:47,681 --> 00:01:51,790
country because they provide the same
high end financial advice that the best

29
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:54,130
private wealth managers
delivered to the ultra wealthy.

30
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,480
But for any account size and at a
fraction of the cost. For instance,

31
00:01:58,481 --> 00:02:02,260
they monitor your portfolio every day
across more than a dozen asset classes to

32
00:02:02,261 --> 00:02:05,680
look for opportunities to
rebalance or harvest tax losses.

33
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:10,980
Now would you do the same? Are
you doing the same? Probably not.

34
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,510
And the powers and the software wealth
front now manages more than $4 billion in

35
00:02:15,511 --> 00:02:18,450
assets,
which is up from around 2.5 billion.

36
00:02:18,451 --> 00:02:20,160
When they started
advertising on this podcast,

37
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,630
they're growing incredibly quickly. Unlike
old fashioned private wealth managers,

38
00:02:24,631 --> 00:02:26,970
wealth front is powered
by innovative technology,

39
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:31,710
making it the most tax efficient,
low cost, hassle free way to invest.

40
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:35,170
They don't have bloated sales
teams or retail locations,

41
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,940
so they can deliver all of this
sophisticated financial advice and these

42
00:02:38,941 --> 00:02:42,400
services at a fraction of the cost
of a traditional financial advisor.

43
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:43,540
So at the very least,

44
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,220
go to wealthfront.com forward slash Tim
and take it they're free risk assessment

45
00:02:48,221 --> 00:02:50,950
survey. It only takes a couple
of minutes and Wealthfront.

46
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,920
We'll recommend a personalized portfolio
of investments. In other words,

47
00:02:53,921 --> 00:02:56,290
they'll tell you exactly where
they would put your money.

48
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:58,360
So even if you don't use their service,

49
00:02:58,361 --> 00:03:01,990
you have a huge up and you have additional
information for making good decisions.

50
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,610
They use investment theory to automate
good financial behavior and decisions

51
00:03:06,611 --> 00:03:08,230
that people typically don't make,

52
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:13,470
but should so go to wealthfront.com
forward slash Tim to get your first 15 k

55
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,400
Hello boys and girls.

56
00:03:22,401 --> 00:03:25,640
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another
episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

57
00:03:25,641 --> 00:03:29,630
it is my job to deconstruct world class
performers of all different types,

58
00:03:29,631 --> 00:03:33,020
whether they're from the worlds of
business, sports, entertainment,

59
00:03:33,021 --> 00:03:34,520
military or otherwise.

60
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:39,910
And this episode we have Ricardo Semler
who was by popular request and it

61
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:42,860
certainly had a large impact on me.

62
00:03:42,861 --> 00:03:46,010
He came up not too long ago in the very,

63
00:03:46,011 --> 00:03:50,420
very popular podcast episode with
Dhh David Hannah Maia Hansen,

64
00:03:50,421 --> 00:03:55,421
who is of the 37 signals base
camp and ruby on rails fame,

65
00:03:55,820 --> 00:04:00,200
who also credits Ricardo with having a
huge impact on him. So who is Ricardo?

66
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:03,710
Cool. I always want to call Ricardo
because he is originally from Brazil.

67
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,980
He is the former CEO of Semco,
a Brazilian company,

68
00:04:06,981 --> 00:04:11,180
best known perhaps for its radical form
of industrial democracy and corporate

69
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:11,931
reengineering.

70
00:04:11,931 --> 00:04:14,570
And all of that will make more sense
as we get into the conversation.

71
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:18,320
We really focus on entrepreneurship
even though there's so much more to talk

72
00:04:18,321 --> 00:04:22,070
about, including education and what
he's done with his Lumiar schools.

73
00:04:22,071 --> 00:04:26,780
But going back to Semco under his
ownership or during his leadership.

74
00:04:26,781 --> 00:04:31,781
Certainly both revenue grew
from $4 million us in 1982
to 212 million US dollars

75
00:04:33,561 --> 00:04:38,030
or so in 2013 and his innovative business
management policies which are very

76
00:04:38,031 --> 00:04:41,870
controversial, attracted very
widespread interest all over the world.

77
00:04:41,871 --> 00:04:43,880
He's taught at Mit,
he's an many,

78
00:04:43,881 --> 00:04:48,881
many other things and most recently he
has started a podcast which is checkout

79
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:53,720
called lead wise and you can find
that at podcast dot lead wise.

80
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,430
Dot Ceo on Twitter.

81
00:04:55,431 --> 00:04:59,610
You can find them at Ricardo Semler or
at let's lead wise if you want to be pot

82
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,610
podcast specific so you can
check out both of those.

83
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,370
Facebook let's lead
wise and then Linkedin,

84
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:09,610
Ricardo Semler and I should also provide
some context for two very similar

85
00:05:11,631 --> 00:05:12,400
sounding book titles.

86
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,860
So he wrote the seven day weekend in
2003 which had a big impact on me.

87
00:05:15,861 --> 00:05:17,070
The four hour work week.

88
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,550
I'm not sure how happy he is about how
seemingly related those titles are.

89
00:05:22,551 --> 00:05:27,020
But came about for those people who don't
know the story from the original title

90
00:05:27,021 --> 00:05:29,810
of the book,
which was drug dealing for fun and profit,

91
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:34,760
which was the tongue and cheek name of
the guest lecture I gave at Princeton and

92
00:05:34,761 --> 00:05:38,570
high tech entrepreneurship. Uh,
ultimately for at least 10 years,

93
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:41,540
I think it was around 2003 to 2013 or so.

94
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:46,370
And when the book was sold to crown
within random house at the time,

95
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,110
there were a few retailers,

96
00:05:48,111 --> 00:05:50,930
I want to say it might've been Walmart
who really didn't like drug dealing for

97
00:05:50,931 --> 00:05:55,100
fun and profit. So I, so I, I
quickly sketched out as did they,

98
00:05:55,180 --> 00:06:00,180
I'd say a dozen or so titles and one
of the ideas was the two hour workweek

99
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:04,700
because that's how long it took me
to manage my company at the time.

100
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,920
But that seemed to unrealistic.
So I was like, all right,

101
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,360
we'll go up to four hours a week.

102
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:13,660
And then I tested that along with the
other titles in Google ad words and for

103
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:18,690
let's just call it $200 a week later
since Google mixes and matches the,

104
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:24,080
the ad headlines,
which were the titles and the ad text,

105
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,250
which were my subtitles,

106
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,740
I knew which combination at
the highest click through rate.

107
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:31,790
And that is how we ended up at the
four hour workweek. But no matter,

108
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:37,030
I will put a shots of a photograph of my
self made index at the beginning of the

109
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:42,460
seven day weekend, which is a great
book and I recommend people check out.

110
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,570
And uh,

111
00:06:43,571 --> 00:06:48,571
this conversation ranges vary very widely
and I hope you enjoy it as much as I

112
00:06:48,881 --> 00:06:53,680
did. So without further ado, please enjoy
my conversation with Ricardo Semler.

113
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,240
Carla, welcome to the
show. Thank you. Thank you.

114
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:03,990
I'm so happy to have you on the phone
and on the show because I have been a fan

115
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:11,330
for so long and I in fact have
this copy of one of your books,

116
00:07:11,371 --> 00:07:16,371
the 70 weekend which has traveled
with me for at least 10 years now.

117
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,950
I bought it when it first came out and
I was looking at the index that I made

118
00:07:19,951 --> 00:07:21,600
for myself in the very beginning,

119
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,480
which I'll have to take a photograph
of and send to you as a, first of all,

120
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,680
as it came up in my conversation with,
with Dhh on the podcast.

121
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:32,040
I just wanted to thank you
for sharing your experiences.

122
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,850
Obviously I have a copy of your

123
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:43,150
work week or a similar name and I'll have
to photograph or that to believe that

124
00:07:43,151 --> 00:07:47,210
you've actually carried it around,
but it's great to, to to catch up.

125
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:52,220
I know you've been very sought full about
all these really deep issues of how to

126
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:55,790
live, how to work and uh, how
do you put wisdom into things,

127
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:56,870
which was my concern as well.

128
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:58,850
I think we'll,

129
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:01,820
we'll want to jump into that and also
talk quite a lot about education.

130
00:08:01,821 --> 00:08:05,900
A lot of my audience has many, many quiz
questions about learning and education,

131
00:08:05,901 --> 00:08:07,490
so we will,
we will certainly get to that.

132
00:08:07,491 --> 00:08:12,491
But for those people who don't have a
lot of background and a lot of context,

133
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:18,160
could you give us perhaps just a
snapshot of where you grew up and your

134
00:08:18,741 --> 00:08:19,650
childhood just as,

135
00:08:19,651 --> 00:08:23,930
as a starting point and then we can depart
from there to many different places.

136
00:08:23,931 --> 00:08:26,090
But that would be very
helpful place to start.

137
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,850
Sure.
And you know,

138
00:08:28,851 --> 00:08:32,450
I was thinking about it the other day
when I've been trying to work with some

139
00:08:32,451 --> 00:08:37,451
guys in the UN and elsewhere about
putting education platforms into refugee

140
00:08:39,281 --> 00:08:43,780
camps in it. And it, it kind of
explains my background as well. My,

141
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:49,460
my parents were both, um,
Ostrin refugees and um,

142
00:08:49,461 --> 00:08:52,300
my, my mother was a refugee in,
in all respects of the world.

143
00:08:52,301 --> 00:08:54,490
And it says the sheep runaway from

144
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:56,190
Vienna to Shanghai.
I

145
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,530
spent 11 years in Shanghai,

146
00:08:58,531 --> 00:09:03,531
but then was kicked out of Shanghai by
Maltitol in 1949 and then actually spent

147
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:10,950
18 months in a tent in a refugee
camp in the south of France.

148
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:15,480
And she was one of these displaced
persons who had no passport whatsoever.

149
00:09:15,481 --> 00:09:16,740
And so it's,

150
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:21,480
it's very interesting how we see
different variations of the word refugee.

151
00:09:21,481 --> 00:09:26,100
But the fact is that she then
became an an immigrant in Brazil,

152
00:09:26,101 --> 00:09:29,710
which is the only place that accepted her.
And um,

153
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,750
and so much later I was
born and she had a, uh,

154
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:37,830
she lost seven pregnancies,
hand still borns, et cetera.

155
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:42,300
And so she always regarded
me as somewhat of a miracle.

156
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:46,140
And a Freud always says that
if your mother believes in you,

157
00:09:46,141 --> 00:09:49,200
absolutely that you can do anything,
then you can do anything.

158
00:09:49,201 --> 00:09:50,460
And that's the only thing it takes.

159
00:09:50,461 --> 00:09:54,990
And so it was very interesting because I
grew up in a household that was already

160
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:59,160
a well to do and we had everything.
And um,

161
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:04,230
and when I got to about 12, 13, I got
involved with rock bands and then I,

162
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:08,190
I spend a lot of time as a Rodeo.
And then as the and playing,

163
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,760
I was never terribly good but enough to,

164
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,060
to kid all in and enough to trickle it
to all my friends into thinking I was

165
00:10:15,061 --> 00:10:17,640
very good and going on
stage here and there,

166
00:10:17,641 --> 00:10:22,290
which is I think probably
the most important part of
it, you know. And uh, so,

167
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,800
um, so why the by the time
I was 17 or 18, I was,

168
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:27,750
I was very much in that mode,

169
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,890
but my father then who was 50
years older than me and uh,

170
00:10:32,891 --> 00:10:33,361
I always,

171
00:10:33,361 --> 00:10:36,870
it was very interesting also because I
kept looking at us 15 years older men

172
00:10:36,871 --> 00:10:40,080
span is almost my grandfather.
And um,

173
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:44,100
and I said I could never do
that myself and so forth.

174
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:48,330
And so promptly I had a son
not when I was 50, so, um,

175
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,460
he's now seven. So some of this stuff
comes back to bite you in the ass.

176
00:10:53,461 --> 00:10:57,420
But the fact is that then I was
17, he wanted me to, you know,

177
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,880
he kept taking me to the
plant and staining Sunday,

178
00:10:59,881 --> 00:11:02,310
all this will be yours because
of the manufacturing plant,

179
00:11:02,311 --> 00:11:06,780
which makes pumps and very
heavy equipment. And he was
very engineering oriented.

180
00:11:06,781 --> 00:11:09,020
There were about a hundred
people there and this wasn't,

181
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:11,370
had been there for a long time
and doing relatively well.

182
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:15,450
But then it started deteriorating.
So the, by the time I was 19 or 20,

183
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:19,170
the whole business, um,
double industry for that was,

184
00:11:19,171 --> 00:11:22,050
it was in very bad shape at that point.

185
00:11:22,051 --> 00:11:25,050
I had decided to do law school
because I didn't want to do,

186
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:30,060
I thought business school in general was
very restricted and very much turned to

187
00:11:30,061 --> 00:11:31,180
the past and so forth.

188
00:11:31,181 --> 00:11:34,830
And I'm wondering more and more
humanistic background that did that.

189
00:11:34,831 --> 00:11:38,640
And then that joined the company in.
And when I joined the company,

190
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,230
I'm kind of following his swishes
while I was still doing law school.

191
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:45,390
Um,
I realized that we had a big,

192
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:50,580
the big difference in the way we saw
the world or how we would run things,

193
00:11:50,581 --> 00:11:53,010
that it was very traditional and
he was wearing a three piece suit.

194
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,070
I was wearing a three piece

195
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:57,700
suit with a watch in my pocket. It
was pretty unbelievable. And then, um,

196
00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:59,440
why was your watching your pocket?

197
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:05,340
Because this was my grandfather's
watch and my father were,

198
00:12:06,751 --> 00:12:10,750
went in his pocket with a little gold
chain and pulled it out every so often,

199
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:14,620
you know, I was ready to
start smoking pipes, you know,

200
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:21,040
this is the world that was just staring
me in the face. It was very, very curious.

201
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:21,610
But,

202
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:26,610
and of course this was all colliding
with the rock guitarist and basis,

203
00:12:27,731 --> 00:12:28,570
which I thought I was,

204
00:12:28,571 --> 00:12:33,370
I had hair down to the middle
of my back until a year before,

205
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:38,050
you know. So this was all very strange
and it was a very strange world.

206
00:12:38,051 --> 00:12:42,130
And I saw people getting, um, uh,

207
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,560
having to come to,

208
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:48,550
to the company and be searched on
their way out and have exact times.

209
00:12:48,551 --> 00:12:51,180
And if there were five
minutes late and docking pay,

210
00:12:51,181 --> 00:12:55,990
and this is an extraordinary world
compared to what I'd seen up to them,

211
00:12:55,991 --> 00:12:59,060
let's say, in the world of rock. And, um,

212
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:04,000
so when I started looking at all that, at
a certain point, I told him, I said this,

213
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,050
we're incompatible here. This is
what I would do here is so different.

214
00:13:08,051 --> 00:13:11,390
And probably you're saying
it would never work. So, um,

215
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,370
let me go do something else.
And um,

216
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:18,730
for a while he just kind of
took the bluff and said, sure,

217
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,230
go see what else you can do.

218
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:24,070
And I found out at that point that the
business world was more interesting than

219
00:13:24,071 --> 00:13:27,010
I thought that I could
do something with it.

220
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,810
And I went out and started looking for
opportunities to do something on my own.

221
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:35,090
And that was not a world 35,
40 years.

222
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:38,830
It was not a world of startups
or anything in the sword.

223
00:13:38,831 --> 00:13:43,090
So if you wanted to start a business,
this is all very hardware oriented.

224
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:48,480
So I went out and I talked to people
who were in the consulting business,

225
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,170
you know,
I want to buy a company,

226
00:13:50,171 --> 00:13:52,720
but I don't actually have
any money to pay for it.

227
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,080
And if I were going to pay for it would
be my dad's by the end. Of course,

228
00:13:56,081 --> 00:13:57,610
that makes no sense whatsoever.

229
00:13:57,611 --> 00:14:02,611
And then I finally found a consultant
at pricewaterhouse of all places who,

230
00:14:02,951 --> 00:14:06,010
um, helped me. He said, no,
you have to do the following.

231
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:09,370
We'll look for companies that are broke
and then have no money whatsoever.

232
00:14:09,371 --> 00:14:10,210
They have a big debt.

233
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:14,050
And if you're not scared of taking on
that and you can buy these companies for a

234
00:14:14,051 --> 00:14:17,380
dollar. And I said, the dollar
I have, let's go do that.

235
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,030
And so we looked at dozens and dozens
of companies finally got to one,

236
00:14:22,031 --> 00:14:27,010
which was a ladder company, made
metal and wooden ladders. And um,

237
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:29,500
and I got to the point of signing,

238
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:33,760
there was 200 page contract that was
sitting at the lawyer's office to sign the

239
00:14:33,761 --> 00:14:35,200
purchase of this company,

240
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:39,580
which was really a very high negative
worth of course because it hadn't been

241
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:43,300
dead how of problems. But the guy
wanted to get rid of it and I said,

242
00:14:43,301 --> 00:14:44,134
give it to me.

243
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:49,840
And suddenly my father bursting
to the law office and he said,

244
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:54,910
what does it cost to pay the fine to do
this deal at the sort of longer sentence

245
00:14:56,871 --> 00:14:59,030
than it was.
I remember it was $200,000,

246
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:01,910
which seemed like an enormous on
Monday and at the time. And so he,

247
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:07,330
he baited and we paid the fine and didn't
sign the agreement and then I started

248
00:15:07,851 --> 00:15:09,860
with the company.
So those are very interesting beginning

249
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:14,850
this, this I think, and please
correct me if I'm wrong,

250
00:15:14,851 --> 00:15:18,660
but sort of probably chronologically it's
close to something I wanted to ask you

251
00:15:18,661 --> 00:15:22,980
about that a lot of my listeners
wanted to ask you about.

252
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:28,010
And that was when you
took the reins as CEO,

253
00:15:28,801 --> 00:15:32,340
maybe you could describe
the circumstances, but the,

254
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:37,190
the firing of 60% of top managers as,

255
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,780
as one of the first decisions.
And,

256
00:15:38,781 --> 00:15:43,781
and I don't know if that is as
straightforward as it might seem,

257
00:15:44,461 --> 00:15:49,461
but the question that came up from a
lot of my listeners was how did you make

258
00:15:50,401 --> 00:15:51,270
that decision?

259
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:57,110
And I would just love to
hear the circumstances
surrounding it and the thought

260
00:15:57,541 --> 00:16:02,310
processes that went into
your first decisions, uh,

261
00:16:02,311 --> 00:16:03,870
when that transition took place.

262
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:08,260
Yeah. And, and it's, it's
interesting. I mean, what,

263
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:13,150
what I told you a little while now
connects to that of course. But, and then,

264
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:17,530
and it's interesting the thought process
when you say, you know, your, your,

265
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:22,780
your listeners want to know this one or
that. And I just, I just started, uh, uh,

266
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:26,900
Lou, our guys have been
suspended a little podcast and,

267
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:31,720
and we've covered a leading wisely and
leading wisely is all about this issue of,

268
00:16:31,721 --> 00:16:31,961
you know,

269
00:16:31,961 --> 00:16:36,961
how do you make some decisions like that
one of firing most of the people and

270
00:16:36,971 --> 00:16:41,650
how do you know that it's
folly or wisdom when you start,

271
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:45,940
you know? And so I'd gotten
to that point where, um,

272
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:51,370
it was either him or me in the sense
of there were two ways of trying to run

273
00:16:51,371 --> 00:16:53,890
this. And at that point the
business wasn't doing very well,

274
00:16:53,891 --> 00:16:57,940
which gave me an opportunity.
But as I looked out at these people,

275
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,690
maybe, you know, we had
a hundred odd people,

276
00:17:01,691 --> 00:17:03,850
so maybe 20 of them a little bit more.

277
00:17:03,851 --> 00:17:08,320
We're either managers or supervisor is
somebody wearing a leading capacity?

278
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:11,990
And I looked out at these people and
I'd already had a little bit experienced

279
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:15,940
with trying to change things and people
were always explained to me why it can't

280
00:17:15,941 --> 00:17:19,000
be done. So they would listen
very patiently and then
they would say, yeah, okay,

281
00:17:19,001 --> 00:17:21,940
but you're a new, you know, you're 19.

282
00:17:21,941 --> 00:17:25,570
You've just that prior to this and the
fact as we've been in this business for

283
00:17:25,571 --> 00:17:27,580
so long and there's this
and there's that event.

284
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:33,070
And I realized that in the amount of time
it would take me to turn these people

285
00:17:33,071 --> 00:17:37,440
around and to deal with the,
um,

286
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:42,460
unconscious sabotage that
everyone who is in place, uh,

287
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:44,470
applies to everyone else.
You know,

288
00:17:44,471 --> 00:17:49,471
anyone who was coming in to something is
always new and hasty and doesn't really

289
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:53,790
understand and you, and so it takes
a hair all the time in the business.

290
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:57,930
At that point, it was not doing well
enough to withstand the long cycle.

291
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,150
Uh,

292
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:03,540
and then I realized that the amount of
sabotage that I'd have in the amount of

293
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:04,321
interactions,

294
00:18:04,321 --> 00:18:09,321
the permutations of firing three people
who then create an alert and panic and

295
00:18:10,471 --> 00:18:14,270
the other six people who talked to the
other five behind our backs and so forth,

296
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,380
it seemed like we didn't
have the time for that.

297
00:18:16,381 --> 00:18:21,090
And it seemed obvious that these
people were terribly, uh, in place,

298
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:26,160
uh, and, uh, completely calcified
with all these users had been there.

299
00:18:26,161 --> 00:18:28,560
So I took a rash decision,

300
00:18:28,561 --> 00:18:32,960
which may be only a 19 or 20 year
old would do, probably wouldn't have,

301
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,030
I don't think I'd ever occurs
to do that today again.

302
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:37,680
But I looked out there and I said,

303
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:42,770
we just sort of pull the bandaid off
this thing so that I can start the next

304
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:46,480
day. And so on one Friday
afternoon, I just called people in,

305
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:48,870
I had never hired anybody
much less fired anyway.

306
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,510
And then I fired out of the old 16,

307
00:18:51,511 --> 00:18:54,720
17 managers and directors
and that included the CEO,

308
00:18:54,721 --> 00:18:58,270
the CFO or anybody who mattered.
And,

309
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:02,430
and these people went home Friday
and didn't return on Monday.

310
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:07,260
And we spent the whole weekend going
through these people's filing cabinets.

311
00:19:07,261 --> 00:19:10,650
This was all paper and going through the
filing cabinet and trying to figure out

312
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:12,420
what the hell is going on in this company.

313
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:15,610
And we would look at it and then we'd
see a customer and they would say, oh,

314
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:19,200
I wonder who this customer is that
we had no idea. And it was really,

315
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:22,350
it was really quite a
quite a rollercoaster ride.

316
00:19:22,351 --> 00:19:27,240
But I think in the end it made us change
direction of course, very quickly.

317
00:19:27,241 --> 00:19:32,100
So that 60 days in we were a completely
different company and then it was

318
00:19:32,101 --> 00:19:35,460
possible to throw out the whole rule
book from, from nothing and say,

319
00:19:35,461 --> 00:19:39,720
what does that, what, what part of this
do we really need? And what part of it,

320
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:43,650
which has just been here
forever and doing that slowly,

321
00:19:43,651 --> 00:19:46,140
I think it would've killed me
and the other guys as well.

322
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:50,870
Did you have many conversations
before making that decision? Was it,

323
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:55,820
was it scary for you to do that? I
guess? Uh, it's just seems like such a,

324
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:00,110
uh, you said rash, but also, I
mean courageous in some respects,

325
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:05,210
decision for someone at that age,
in that position.

326
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,650
Did you have any conversations inside
your head or with other people that

327
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,400
allowed you to take that,
that leap and make that decision?

328
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:16,010
I'm just wondering what
sort of led up to it.

329
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:20,910
Yeah,
I'm imagining that there must have been

330
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:27,420
and I can think basically any one or
two people who from the beginning I felt

331
00:20:27,421 --> 00:20:30,150
would be on the right side and they'll,
maybe I tested it with slightly,

332
00:20:30,151 --> 00:20:35,130
but I already knew as well that I
couldn't tip off the system or the wrong

333
00:20:35,131 --> 00:20:36,390
people.
And I didn't know enough people.

334
00:20:36,391 --> 00:20:41,391
I remember talking to my dad a few days
before because he was about to go on a

335
00:20:44,251 --> 00:20:47,320
trip to Europe and I said, uh, you know,

336
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:50,810
I have to do a few things here and it
might involve some of the, and he said,

337
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:54,550
and I imagined, I imagined,
uh, do everything while I'm in.

338
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:57,971
As soon as he,

339
00:20:57,971 --> 00:21:01,210
I think he traveled and we traveled on
Thursday and I called everybody and on

340
00:21:01,211 --> 00:21:02,910
Fridays. So, but I think it was,

341
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:07,060
it was knocking around inside my head
in the sense that, Geez, you know, if I,

342
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:12,010
if I tried to do this the old
fashioned way or the soul cycle, um,

343
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:13,810
this is going to be 10 times as hard,

344
00:21:13,811 --> 00:21:18,811
but also the chance that I actually get
to the end of this as smaller and a,

345
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,880
I felt in many respects that
on top of it being rushed,

346
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:23,710
I felt I really had no option.

347
00:21:23,711 --> 00:21:27,760
There was no time and we needed to do
this very quick. And now of course,

348
00:21:27,761 --> 00:21:32,690
that gave me an opportunity to
have a startup, let's say, um,

349
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:34,590
on Monday from a,

350
00:21:34,591 --> 00:21:38,740
a business that was already
30 years old on Friday.

351
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,530
You, uh, I want to flash forward a little
bit and I'm sure we'll fill in the,

352
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:48,140
some of the gaps in there will
be stories that will come back,

353
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:52,640
but could you please describe the,
uh,

354
00:21:52,641 --> 00:21:57,641
I would love to know the actual meaning
of the title Vii Donda Appropriate Mesa

355
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:04,580
and which is,
as I understand it later became maverick,

356
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,260
but clearly in,

357
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:10,280
I don't speak Portuguese but seems
to mean something very different than

358
00:22:10,281 --> 00:22:11,114
maverick.

359
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:15,290
Can you describe how that book came to be?

360
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:18,980
And as I understand it became the best
selling nonfiction book in the history of

361
00:22:18,981 --> 00:22:21,110
Brazil, which is saying something. I mean,

362
00:22:21,111 --> 00:22:24,530
there are a lot of books I've spent
some time in result to it that that's a

363
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:27,900
nontrivial accomplishment.
So what does [inaudible] mean?

364
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:32,350
Literally,
it means turning your own tables,

365
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:36,610
but it's basically
turning the tables with,

366
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,210
you're stuck in the middle there
to make it more self facing,

367
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:45,220
you know,
but it was really about an in Portuguese,

368
00:22:45,221 --> 00:22:49,450
it makes a little bit more sense, but
it is in the same, in the same thing,

369
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:52,840
which is to say, uh, turning
everything upside down and so forth,

370
00:22:52,841 --> 00:22:57,220
which was this whole process of starting
from scratch and changing the rules

371
00:22:57,221 --> 00:22:59,870
entirety. And it was really just, Eh,

372
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:03,270
because let's say from maybe the five,

373
00:23:03,271 --> 00:23:07,050
six years after this mass firing,

374
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:10,570
let's say in which we
started, uh, redoing things,

375
00:23:10,571 --> 00:23:15,350
we started asking questions. And I don't
know, it seems a very simple process,

376
00:23:15,351 --> 00:23:17,930
but actually when you do it,
you realize that potential,

377
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:21,770
which was a whole process of
asking three why's in a row.

378
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:23,450
That was the only thing we were doing.
And I said,

379
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:25,940
since we're starting this again,
tell me again,

380
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:29,810
why do we search people in the way I
knew all the people have to arrive at the

381
00:23:29,811 --> 00:23:33,400
same time, et cetera. When
you ask three why's in a row,

382
00:23:33,401 --> 00:23:35,830
the first why people have
a very good answer for,

383
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:39,490
they've been thinking about this for a
long time or they'd be living this for a

384
00:23:39,491 --> 00:23:43,690
long time. Yeah. And so people say,

385
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:47,930
why do people have to be here at the same
time? And they'll look at you and say,

386
00:23:47,931 --> 00:23:51,590
Oh poor kid look a little dense.
Let me explain to you, you know,

387
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,460
think I guy comes here and the guy next
to him on the assembly line is not here.

388
00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:00,380
Yes I'm aligned. Does non
woo. That's the first,

389
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:04,040
the first set of whys and it
just becomes more sophisticated.

390
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:07,550
But they did the same thing
to me. It uh, law school,

391
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,230
the Harvard Business School,

392
00:24:09,231 --> 00:24:13,480
everywhere I heard this same
condescending response to,

393
00:24:13,481 --> 00:24:16,550
or let me explain it to you.
So the first why is the easy one?

394
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:21,460
And I always say that I have five
kids in the smallest one is seven.

395
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:25,160
And I always say that when you have
the three why's and you asked them,

396
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:29,480
they asked you something, anything,
they said that why is this this way?

397
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:34,340
And the first question is why is
easy to answer? And then they'll say,

398
00:24:34,341 --> 00:24:38,330
but why that? And then you start getting
into a little bit of trouble, you know,

399
00:24:38,331 --> 00:24:40,880
really, because by the third
way you have only one option,

400
00:24:40,881 --> 00:24:42,570
which is to buy them an ice cream.
And

401
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:47,480
this is what happened to be there.
So I'd say,

402
00:24:47,481 --> 00:24:52,010
why do we have to come in right
time at the same time? Or we say,

403
00:24:52,011 --> 00:24:55,720
why were we all dressed the
same way wherever you are
wearing suits and ties. Oh,

404
00:24:55,721 --> 00:24:59,600
you know, so that will look more
like your term. Okay, great.

405
00:24:59,601 --> 00:25:02,730
Why don't we want to look
more like each other? No,

406
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:07,640
because this is the same with almost
anything you ask of business rules.

407
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:10,640
There was a reason sometimes somebody
who was concerned with something,

408
00:25:10,641 --> 00:25:13,130
but it wasn't really essential
to what you're trying to do.

409
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:18,670
And so we would say if we can't answer
the three whys about anything or about

410
00:25:18,671 --> 00:25:21,350
any rule, let's just throw
it out and see what's left.

411
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:25,850
And we were left with absolutely nothing,
hardly anything of, of really important.

412
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,173
And,
um,

413
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:32,680
and so we started organizing ourselves
around this new way of if you can't

414
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:37,790
justify it,
absolutely let's try to do it without,

415
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:39,520
and uh,

416
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:44,240
that went for organization
charts and boxes and titles.

417
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:46,730
And you know,
when we were asking things like,

418
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:50,630
why can't you just set your own title,
choose any title you want,

419
00:25:50,631 --> 00:25:54,650
put it on him on a business card.
And if the guy who wants to,

420
00:25:55,220 --> 00:26:00,220
who's going to buy from you and you put
their rather right VP regional sales

421
00:26:01,881 --> 00:26:03,590
manager instead of trainee,

422
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:07,970
I don't care as long as he buys from
you and trust you and you deliver the

423
00:26:07,971 --> 00:26:11,600
product. And off we go. And so we
started doing this for everything.

424
00:26:11,601 --> 00:26:14,150
And so we threw out the organizations,
are we through our drop titles?

425
00:26:14,151 --> 00:26:16,270
We said very quickly we
started asking questions.

426
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:19,070
Why doesn't everyone know
what everyone else makes here?

427
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:23,390
Why can't people set their own
salaries and nothing resisted.

428
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:27,790
Three wives in a row. And I met
the man I can. Long story short,

429
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,670
suddenly the company started doing well
and then instead of a hundred people,

430
00:26:31,671 --> 00:26:36,671
we had 200 and then 500 and a thousand
and in 2000 and then at a point we said,

431
00:26:37,371 --> 00:26:40,940
um, when people start to
say, oh, you know, you've got
to write a book, you know,

432
00:26:40,941 --> 00:26:44,540
you've got to tell this story in a book.
And I said, no, I don't stop bugging us.

433
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:48,000
But at a certain point in time, I sat
down, I said, I think I'll write a book.

434
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:51,690
So I started on a Friday and I
ended up down the other Sunday.

435
00:26:51,691 --> 00:26:55,950
So I spent nine days riding.
And uh, and that was it. And I,

436
00:26:55,951 --> 00:27:00,951
it's interesting because I
considered that book so belonging to,

437
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:02,930
to, you know, the,

438
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:07,920
the sin air and not to myself that I
never corrected any grammatical mistakes.

439
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:09,900
And,

440
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,870
and it came to me from the publisher as
many times as you surely don't want to

441
00:27:12,871 --> 00:27:15,120
correct that you,
this is silly what your role here.

442
00:27:15,121 --> 00:27:17,490
And there's stuff that I'm
not at all proud of anymore.

443
00:27:17,491 --> 00:27:19,270
Of course then there's a lot
of mistakes. And I said, no,

444
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,600
you can't touch it can
through them along to anybody.

445
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:24,510
And so what happened was I sent it out,

446
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:29,540
I finished it in ink and it
was 900 pages of pen and ink.

447
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,330
And I, I took it, I had,

448
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:38,900
I had someone type it and then I send
it out to the eight big publishers in

449
00:27:39,751 --> 00:27:43,440
Brazil and the eight rejected it.

450
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:48,240
And uh, it didn't take them very long,
either eight rejected. And they said,

451
00:27:48,241 --> 00:27:51,270
you know, nobody wants to hear anything
from Brazilian businessman. You know,

452
00:27:51,271 --> 00:27:56,271
they're buying the coker and kill more
return and all these guys in their home,

453
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,370
nobody wants to hear
from resume businessmen.

454
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:04,170
And then one of the guys that talked to
me, he said, you know what we could do,

455
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:08,910
we could give this out as a
year end gift from the company.

456
00:28:08,911 --> 00:28:13,530
Wouldn't that be nice? It's 300 calm.
Is there some? And I said, you know,

457
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:17,540
my ego is not small enough for
that. I can't do that. And then

458
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:24,750
I found a publisher who
was the night and I said,

459
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:28,020
this is not possible.
You've got to publish this.

460
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,740
This for me and a small
version and you can't,

461
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:35,190
you can't lose all that much money and
so forth. So finally the guy says, sure,

462
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:40,020
I'll do it. And we had a very
interesting discussion about, uh,

463
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:42,540
royalties because he said,

464
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:46,590
or what you get is 10% Reuters and
that's how that sounds good. And I said,

465
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:51,330
what if it sells more than 5,000 copies?
And so he laughed and said,

466
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:55,470
no. So, okay, 11% anyway,
we had this whole,

467
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,990
this whole table, because
I kept asking, I said,

468
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:01,710
what about 50,000 and then you need almost
fall off the table after uni as well

469
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:06,270
as make that 15% anyway,
so I got a 20%

470
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:08,930
of a million

471
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:14,550
sales and but what happened was I,
I really never thought,

472
00:29:14,551 --> 00:29:18,580
of course that I knew what I was doing
and I knew this book was very necessary

473
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:21,570
part, but I just wanted at
least to get it out there.

474
00:29:21,571 --> 00:29:25,470
But apparently it was a bit
like a surfboard, you know,

475
00:29:25,471 --> 00:29:28,370
that you're sitting there and
suddenly the big wave comes the wave.

476
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:29,370
I didn't make,
you know,

477
00:29:29,371 --> 00:29:33,630
there people were apparently ready to
think about a different way of doing

478
00:29:33,631 --> 00:29:37,400
things. And so they took, they
took the book forward in it.

479
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:41,130
Nothing happened at all
because he put the book out,

480
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,790
there was no publicity,

481
00:29:42,791 --> 00:29:46,690
there was nothing in about week later
somebody found it and then somebody wrote

482
00:29:46,691 --> 00:29:51,691
a review and then it's spend 200 weeks
on the bestseller list of which 150 weeks

483
00:29:54,491 --> 00:29:58,570
a number when it was very simple. It's
just when Mt Martha and apparently it hit,

484
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:02,890
it had um, uh, a moment, a nerve,

485
00:30:02,891 --> 00:30:05,350
a time in which it went off on its own.

486
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:08,470
But so that's a long winded response to,

487
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:12,580
it's called turning the tables because
of this whole turning things upside down

488
00:30:12,581 --> 00:30:15,880
and finding out that it works just as
well. And in our case a lot better.

489
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,870
A couple while I'll have a
million followup questions,

490
00:30:19,871 --> 00:30:24,220
but I have a few that are
related to, we've talked
about so far. So the first is,

491
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,990
and this might seem super
specific,

492
00:30:28,991 --> 00:30:30,280
but what is,

493
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:34,150
what is the right way
to fire someone or how,

494
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:38,260
how would you go about firing someone
now or to those entrepreneurs listening?

495
00:30:38,261 --> 00:30:42,010
So of course you had your approach
when you first came into the company,

496
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:46,330
but how, how has that changed
or evolved over time? What is,

497
00:30:46,331 --> 00:30:49,180
what is the right way to fire someone
if you need to let someone go?

498
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:54,910
You know, sometimes my, my
wife says that, you know, it's,

499
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:58,850
it's so nice being fired by you that I
keep thinking this was a very positive

500
00:30:58,851 --> 00:31:03,280
thing and I see all these people
getting up here after you aside.

501
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:04,570
I really have to find this person.

502
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,250
Then they get up and they're smiling
and they're patting me on the back and I

503
00:31:07,251 --> 00:31:11,120
said, what the hell are you doing with
his firing process? But the fact is this,

504
00:31:11,121 --> 00:31:15,620
that um, one when, when you get close
to it, some people are surprised,

505
00:31:15,621 --> 00:31:19,970
but most people have an inkling already
that things are not doing well. Um,

506
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:24,350
I have this, this, uh, if
someone's working close to me,

507
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:28,430
and that's the only situation of
course where there's firing situation,

508
00:31:28,431 --> 00:31:30,800
but persons working
close to me and it's not,

509
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:36,200
it's not going places early on.
I do very little of that.

510
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:40,550
Let's do this again, let's do another
and another chance, another way,

511
00:31:40,551 --> 00:31:44,660
another cycle, et cetera. So
it's highly, highly intuitive.

512
00:31:44,661 --> 00:31:46,610
And so to me,
if it doesn't show right,

513
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,660
it's not good for the person
or for me to continue.

514
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,650
And so I'll sit the personality and say,
this isn't working.

515
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:58,430
And for many respects the personal,
so I didn't realize or I didn't think so,

516
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:02,600
not wait a second, what this and that,
but um, it's all about being very,

517
00:32:02,601 --> 00:32:05,720
very exceedingly frank and saying,
you know,

518
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:08,720
and most of the time it's
a situation which I say,

519
00:32:08,721 --> 00:32:12,440
you can definitely count on good
references. Let me see if I can help you.

520
00:32:12,441 --> 00:32:15,410
Let's think about where you could
go from here instead of that.

521
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:19,580
And mostly I think that that's the bit
of white people in the end don't feel so

522
00:32:19,581 --> 00:32:24,560
bad about it is because I look forward a
bit of a few months or a few years in a

523
00:32:24,561 --> 00:32:28,280
city, you're going to be stuck here.
I want this from you. You're not,

524
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:29,443
you're obviously,

525
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:33,250
this isn't a fitting your profile
entirely and you're going to keep adding,

526
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:37,670
keep adding to that. But slowly
we're going to start the abrasion.

527
00:32:37,671 --> 00:32:40,070
We'll sit in, you know, and I'll be

528
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:44,480
more ill humored about this or you'll
find that getting up on Monday morning and

529
00:32:44,481 --> 00:32:47,000
coming to do this isn't
as fun as it used to be.

530
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:52,200
Well let's cut all this at the rule
and gives you a real chance of finding

531
00:32:52,551 --> 00:32:55,630
something that, that makes you a lot
happier. And, and normally I'll say this,

532
00:32:55,631 --> 00:32:58,130
this is in here. It makes me seem
like something you'd do well,

533
00:32:58,131 --> 00:33:02,630
but let me tell you this, this doesn't
work but this, that you're good at,

534
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:04,580
you should be able to
find a way to do that.

535
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:09,530
And normally it ends relatively
well because it is so based on,

536
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:11,240
on transparency,
you know?

537
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:12,823
Definitely.

538
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:18,110
And when you subject these conventions
to the three whys and everything falls

539
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:22,040
apart or it just isn't justifiable.

540
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:25,250
So now you're effectively
dealing with a blank canvas.

541
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:30,590
How do you choose what to do first?
Or if somebody does this in a company,

542
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:34,580
is there particular order you might
suggest that they tackle things in if

543
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:38,840
they're just left with all of these
rules from all the way from say,

544
00:33:38,841 --> 00:33:43,841
marketing to finance to hiring to fill
in the blank have have fallen by the

545
00:33:46,071 --> 00:33:49,130
wayside because they can't be justified.
Where do you start?

546
00:33:49,131 --> 00:33:54,020
Because I could see a lot of people
feeling scattered or becoming scattered.

547
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:57,860
How do you choose or how did you
choose what to do first, second, third.

548
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:01,050
You know when,
when you,

549
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:06,110
when you think Tim about what you
write about and what inspires you.

550
00:34:06,361 --> 00:34:09,740
When are you going to
the issue of a Workweek,

551
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:14,730
a chef for a workout or
how to live a life wisely.

552
00:34:14,731 --> 00:34:18,060
You're basically concentrated on process.

553
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:21,390
The process by which you do all of
this is the one that makes sense.

554
00:34:21,391 --> 00:34:26,391
So I would definitely start by the
process that takes us out of bed.

555
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:31,740
You know, the bit that makes you get
up and go somewhere to do something,

556
00:34:31,741 --> 00:34:35,830
that that process is the first one
that needs to be changed. So, um,

557
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:38,550
how often do you want to work?
How many hours do you want to work?

558
00:34:38,551 --> 00:34:41,070
Who you want to work with in
what place you want to work?

559
00:34:41,071 --> 00:34:46,071
That is the one that to me would be the
number one issue because if you have

560
00:34:46,441 --> 00:34:49,590
people in your company,
organization,

561
00:34:49,591 --> 00:34:53,610
wherever you are that are doing this
because you told them to or somebody told

562
00:34:53,611 --> 00:34:55,110
them to her,
it's always been done that way.

563
00:34:55,470 --> 00:35:00,360
Or people aren't stopping to think about
why the heck should I take the subway

564
00:35:00,361 --> 00:35:03,390
and a bus and go to a place
downtown and so forth.

565
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:08,600
This is the stuff that is undermining
your whole opportunity to have the right

566
00:35:09,931 --> 00:35:13,150
process.
So I would always start with do,

567
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:17,670
is this really what you want to
do? Oh yeah, I love doing okay,

568
00:35:17,671 --> 00:35:20,160
but you love doing it at this time
of the day? No, not really. Actually.

569
00:35:20,161 --> 00:35:23,190
If I could take my kids school person,
right.

570
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:26,090
This is the stuff that I would
take off, you know, what are the,

571
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:28,800
what's the stuff that you're
doing or how you're doing it,

572
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:34,100
which somebody asks for or
somebody thought was going
to be smart or was a good

573
00:35:34,951 --> 00:35:37,530
idea four years ago.
This is the date,

574
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:40,260
I'm sorry to interrupt and this is
something you would ask of every employee.

575
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:44,510
Yeah. And, and we did of course.
And so we ended up of course,

576
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:46,640
was people who didn't want
to come at the same time,

577
00:35:46,641 --> 00:35:51,290
who didn't want to work there anymore.
We went from one one building,

578
00:35:51,291 --> 00:35:53,150
which was when we started
asking this question,

579
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:56,660
we had one central building and everybody
came to us and this was the obvious

580
00:35:56,930 --> 00:36:00,920
solution. Um, within maybe
a year, year and a half,

581
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:03,790
we had 14 different places around Tom.

582
00:36:03,791 --> 00:36:07,850
And so we would say go to the place
that's nearest your house or near as the

583
00:36:07,851 --> 00:36:10,790
customer you want to visit
or to uncle anywhere. Uh,

584
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:14,960
but don't even tell us because we don't
want to have anyone who keeps tabs on

585
00:36:14,961 --> 00:36:19,910
you because your process of how you want
to do this is the most important thing.

586
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:22,400
And let's negotiate you and us.

587
00:36:22,401 --> 00:36:25,070
Let's contract for something
you're going to do.

588
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:28,370
Are you gonna sell 56
widgets a week? Oh, great.

589
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,650
So if you sell 56 widgets on Wednesday,

590
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,620
please go to the beach
on Thursday and Friday.

591
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:37,550
Do not show up and sell more widgets
because you're going to create an enormous

592
00:36:37,551 --> 00:36:41,960
problem for engineering and manufacturing
and consumer has to go out and buy

593
00:36:41,961 --> 00:36:42,800
another company.

594
00:36:42,801 --> 00:36:47,801
And under those don't do this before
we thought it through your six 56 which

595
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,740
where you're going to do it from how
you did it is none of our concern.

596
00:36:51,741 --> 00:36:55,340
Don't tell us, just tell the 56
witches now will always be fine.

597
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:59,440
And this is true for everything
else is true for accounting,

598
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,760
as for marketing and so forth.

599
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:05,780
And so the process of how you're going
to do this isn't necessarily yours and we

600
00:37:06,201 --> 00:37:09,500
don't want to be in the way. So here
are 14 different places you can go to,

601
00:37:09,501 --> 00:37:12,080
few wants, you can stay
in bed, we don't care.

602
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:15,280
Don't tell us how many hours you worked
or how hard it was still the widgets.

603
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:18,690
Cause we don't have any place to put
that information that that was the,

604
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,240
the whole focus on process.

605
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:26,030
And when you're asking why not a, B,

606
00:37:26,031 --> 00:37:29,170
and c, right. And when you're, when
you're testing these assumptions,

607
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:34,710
are there any particular notable failures
that come to mind with tests that you

608
00:37:34,901 --> 00:37:35,734
performed?

609
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:40,800
Oh yeah. And, and I, I can, I can think
of a few and I'll tell you she'll,

610
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:45,830
but the main thing is that the enormous
amount of mistakes that one makes in

611
00:37:47,461 --> 00:37:49,770
organizations with your wife,

612
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:54,180
with your kids at the church in
a group battalion and so forth,

613
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:58,200
is so humongous that you have to
consider a bit, you know, the,

614
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:03,250
the Babe Ruth permutation that if you
just hit more home runs than you miss the

615
00:38:04,381 --> 00:38:07,380
ball. But can you think, how
many times does it miss them all?

616
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:10,440
And here we have very little in general.

617
00:38:10,441 --> 00:38:12,930
We have very little patience
for these mistakes. And,

618
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:16,980
and my thing is really to brush aside
the mistake and say, hey, that's great.

619
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:20,940
That was wrong. Let's try this again now
for a wrong again and again and again.

620
00:38:20,941 --> 00:38:22,440
That's,
that's really no problem.

621
00:38:22,441 --> 00:38:25,950
We just have to be batting
in the right direction.

622
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:29,850
So there's a lot of things that
we started that we thought was,

623
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:34,080
was really smart. You know,
we figured all this out. Um,

624
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:38,290
and for we, with the, with
the whole search thing,

625
00:38:38,291 --> 00:38:41,560
that was a very big issue because we had,
um,

626
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:44,740
we had all these electronic components,
we had all kinds of stuff,

627
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:46,190
which people said,
just crazy.

628
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:49,990
People take this in their purses
and in their hair and so forth.

629
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:55,490
And we said,
it doesn't matter on the way out.

630
00:38:56,730 --> 00:39:00,950
And I'm going back here 35
years, and it was open. This is,

631
00:39:00,951 --> 00:39:05,440
this was a big issue because everyone
kept checking the stocks and there was

632
00:39:05,441 --> 00:39:07,600
those always something
missing from inventory.

633
00:39:07,601 --> 00:39:12,430
And this was all very expensive
stuff, which was easy to
take. We worked, you know,

634
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:16,270
in the motors were all copper
wires in and there was silver this.

635
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:20,410
And then there was, uh,
components and so forth. And, um,

636
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:22,180
and I was saying,
you know,

637
00:39:22,181 --> 00:39:27,181
the process here is that I
cannot work with people that I,

638
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:31,390
I interact with and we try to do things
together with, I have empathy with,

639
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:34,990
and then I search on their way out to
find out whether they're stealing from me

640
00:39:34,991 --> 00:39:37,090
that it's just not possible.
It can't be done.

641
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:41,860
And so for some time that
didn't work at all because, uh,

642
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:46,750
slowly are,
we had a lot of inventory problems and,

643
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:48,330
uh,
uh,

644
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:52,720
the amount of losses that we had in the
months following was obvious and people

645
00:39:52,721 --> 00:39:56,770
would look at us, let's see here.
Silly. I, you know, it's getting worse.

646
00:39:56,830 --> 00:40:00,640
And My, my reaction to that
at that point was, do we,

647
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:03,110
do we keep this inventory,
uh,

648
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:07,300
safe and the locked up and people
have to requisition. Yes, yes. Okay,

649
00:40:07,301 --> 00:40:09,280
well let's give up that process as well.

650
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,730
And just leave the store
is completely open.

651
00:40:12,731 --> 00:40:14,380
The inventory and anybody
can take anything.

652
00:40:14,381 --> 00:40:17,710
And then for the first time we had to
decrease until the problem went away

653
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:21,430
because,
because the whole process was,

654
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:25,480
if we're showing you here in there that
we don't trust you and sign this and

655
00:40:25,481 --> 00:40:29,690
lock this in and so forth, and then
we're just making sure you don't steal.

656
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:33,370
It's a crazy situation. It's always
a very small minority of people.

657
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:35,980
And as we put the process in place,

658
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:41,400
people started saying through
a form where they would,

659
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:45,910
it would come together at a meeting and
decide who they needed in their air for

660
00:40:45,911 --> 00:40:50,410
the next six months and slowly the
system expelled the people who were just

661
00:40:50,411 --> 00:40:52,540
stealing. And, uh,

662
00:40:52,541 --> 00:40:55,360
I dunno what happened over
the years who've stayed in
these 35 years of people's

663
00:40:55,361 --> 00:40:59,440
stolen more or less, etc. It, we
don't measure it. We have no idea.

664
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:01,000
We've never had any idea,

665
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:05,710
but it's never become an issue big
enough to worry about since, you know.

666
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,830
And so what I meant to say
was that we make a lot,

667
00:41:08,831 --> 00:41:12,790
we made a lot of mistakes in
every one of these processes.

668
00:41:12,791 --> 00:41:15,370
When we started telling people on the
assembly line, they take good time,

669
00:41:15,371 --> 00:41:18,700
could come anytime they wanted.
They could leave their kids at school,

670
00:41:18,701 --> 00:41:20,950
they could stay longer in bed.

671
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:25,810
Of course for a time the sandwich line
suffered and we didn't deliver some

672
00:41:25,811 --> 00:41:27,700
products and people were
pulling their hairs out.

673
00:41:27,701 --> 00:41:31,480
But then a few weeks later suddenly
these people realize. Then they'd say,

674
00:41:31,481 --> 00:41:34,010
well wait a second, you're
not here. This is a seminar

675
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:36,350
I was going to move. So what time you
think you're getting here tomorrow?

676
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:39,780
And a whole new schedule
started coming into place.

677
00:41:39,781 --> 00:41:44,781
So I'd say ultimately if the process
decision is to to trust people to believe

678
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:46,970
in people as people,

679
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:51,010
the issues go away with time and they
just look like mistakes in the short term.

680
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:57,490
I think this is actually a good place
to perhaps tie this to folks who are

681
00:41:57,491 --> 00:42:00,400
listening who have say smaller companies.

682
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,960
So let's just say they have
fewer than 10 employees.

683
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:08,830
A lot of people listening
to this are entrepreneurs.

684
00:42:08,831 --> 00:42:12,460
They might be Solo preneurs who were
doing their first hiring or people with

685
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,350
small groups,
small teams.

686
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:18,820
What are some experiments,
uh,

687
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:23,850
or questions or any type of assumption
busting that you might suggest they test

688
00:42:26,291 --> 00:42:27,940
for themselves? Is the, are there any,

689
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,710
are there any good starting points for
people who have processes in place but

690
00:42:32,711 --> 00:42:37,690
they're small teams, relatively flexible
but very, very resource constrained. Uh,

691
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:42,340
w well, where might they start
in terms of, of, of testing?

692
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:49,370
I think I'm doing your first
urge is to become organized.

693
00:42:49,961 --> 00:42:54,240
Are, are a great place because,
um, when you have the two,

694
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:58,030
three and you're in your backyard or
and go Raj and suddenly something seems

695
00:42:58,031 --> 00:43:02,710
viable and you're writing cold or
you're put together a small object which

696
00:43:02,711 --> 00:43:05,980
suddenly has shop wants, um, you're,

697
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:10,630
you're in your most
primitive creative stage.

698
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:16,560
It's not dutiful and romantic and shine
dot coastal all around it or thorough.

699
00:43:17,801 --> 00:43:21,460
It's really, um, your
first urge. When you,

700
00:43:21,461 --> 00:43:24,580
when you start going places slowly and you

701
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:30,080
start realizing that people are
interested or there's more volume,

702
00:43:30,081 --> 00:43:32,980
more expansion possible, that's when you
start looking around and say, whoops,

703
00:43:32,981 --> 00:43:35,530
I need more people.
But very soon after,

704
00:43:35,531 --> 00:43:39,850
and you might have eight or in your mind
have 12, and then suddenly you say, oops,

705
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:43,180
no, wait a and this, we're going to
go, we're going to become bigger.

706
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:44,980
I need to get organized.

707
00:43:44,981 --> 00:43:49,981
I think this is probably
the single riskiest point
because it doesn't seem like

708
00:43:50,831 --> 00:43:51,940
such a big assumption.

709
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:57,340
You might ask someone who supposedly
knows or you'll spend some time on the web

710
00:43:57,341 --> 00:44:02,341
looking at literature of organization
and then suddenly you're stuck in a world

711
00:44:03,851 --> 00:44:08,380
which starts a scribing in prescribing
and describing how you should be doing

712
00:44:08,381 --> 00:44:12,910
things. Um, and I think that
that is the original sin,

713
00:44:12,911 --> 00:44:15,430
let's say,
of organizations.

714
00:44:15,431 --> 00:44:20,431
And so I would say resisting the rationale
that is being handed down to you,

715
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:27,780
that you would need to get organized and
I think is much more valuable than it

716
00:44:27,821 --> 00:44:30,560
sounds. And people look at that
and said, well, wait a second.

717
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,010
I don't have the this and I

718
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:35,610
don't have a software that does that.
And if I don't give my payroll to that,

719
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:40,230
I'll never know when this will be wrong
and so forth. And you find that the,

720
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:41,153
the stuff,

721
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:46,160
let's say the bureaucracy that that has
to be dealt with is nothing like the

722
00:44:46,171 --> 00:44:50,700
creative effort of communicating
and dealing with people
and giving them freedom.

723
00:44:50,701 --> 00:44:54,900
And slowly you find that as you grow from
eight to 12 to 14 years, just they say,

724
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:59,690
oh, wait a second before we
could do this. But now I'm, I'm,

725
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:05,190
I'm not able to just hire somebody
or agree and contract for something.

726
00:45:05,941 --> 00:45:09,990
I need to know what they're doing.
And I think that when you start asking,

727
00:45:09,991 --> 00:45:14,150
why do you need to know all, because
if, I don't know, I can't, um,

728
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:16,860
following them on slack, but I don't
really understand what they're doing.

729
00:45:16,861 --> 00:45:18,150
I don't know where they really come in.

730
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:21,570
I don't know if they're working harder
or less than someone else where they

731
00:45:21,571 --> 00:45:25,760
should be making that. And
maybe the answer to all of
this is it doesn't matter.

732
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:29,010
You know, this or not. If
you get down to the very,

733
00:45:29,011 --> 00:45:33,720
very few things that really
mattered to you being unorganized,

734
00:45:33,721 --> 00:45:38,220
a parent, which is not knowing a lot of
this stuff becomes completely irrelevant.

735
00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:41,520
I've had now in the last two years,
Tim,

736
00:45:41,521 --> 00:45:45,930
I've been dealing with
kids, you know, 25 year old,

737
00:45:45,931 --> 00:45:49,740
28 year old, 32 year
olds who have, uh, oh,

738
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:53,320
I've started businesses with, um, one,

739
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:57,570
one of the businesses, which
is a, in Holland for example,

740
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:01,410
these guys started this
business and I have some, uh,

741
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:05,850
minority partners and have some equity
partners, et Cetera, who I have never met.

742
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:09,510
I've never met personally.
I've never met on Skype.

743
00:46:09,590 --> 00:46:13,710
I have a few people who went to, who was,
let's say, CEO of a startup, et cetera.

744
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:17,700
And I have not the slightest idea what
it looks like, trees tall or short.

745
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:22,530
I haven't very generic
idea of age and so forth.

746
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:25,140
And one of these people
the other day I was,

747
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:30,480
I set up time to talk to and they said,
oh, the time's not very good. And I said,

748
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:35,790
why not? Oh, because I live in
Australia. And I said, what? So, eh?

749
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:39,280
And I said, well, how the
hell did I know that said,

750
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:41,850
you're never asked where there.
And so this,

751
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:46,830
this whole process is now I think one
in which I would highly recommend to

752
00:46:46,831 --> 00:46:50,640
people that they do not fall into the
trap of saying, I need to get organized.

753
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:51,660
I need to know all of this.

754
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:56,370
Because the essence of what people
are trying to do with their lives,

755
00:46:56,371 --> 00:46:58,260
their businesses and the organizations,

756
00:46:58,590 --> 00:47:03,590
they really don't require the amount
of information and communication and

757
00:47:04,021 --> 00:47:06,060
structure that you think it needs.
You know,

758
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:10,300
w what would you suggest they
focus on in instead of that?

759
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:15,570
I'm just in maybe the way to frame it is
besides a flipbook focusing excessively

760
00:47:17,861 --> 00:47:22,240
on the bureaucracy and
putting systems in place, um,

761
00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:27,690
what are some of the other most
common mistakes that people in smaller

762
00:47:28,691 --> 00:47:32,560
companies,
and I should say also that we might not,

763
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:36,460
those companies may stay the same size. So
they may, let's just say that, you know,

764
00:47:36,461 --> 00:47:38,860
10 person company,
they're creating a great product,

765
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:43,850
but they want to scale in revenues,
potentially not headcount. Um,

766
00:47:44,650 --> 00:47:46,030
so a,
either one of the most,

767
00:47:46,031 --> 00:47:49,510
some other common mistakes that the
people in that position make or be,

768
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:52,840
what should they focus on instead
of what might they focus on instead?

769
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:57,680
I think there's a lot of
rationalization and a lot of

770
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:04,980
tricking yourself, you know, because,
and I think that's a very dangerous

771
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:11,580
enemy that you don't really
realize because whether
you're going to grow or not

772
00:48:11,581 --> 00:48:13,320
and it's doing well,
et Cetera,

773
00:48:13,321 --> 00:48:18,321
what happens is that there's a point
where you try some of the things that

774
00:48:18,421 --> 00:48:18,920
you're,

775
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:23,920
you're testing out there and that you
tend to insist very much either on an

776
00:48:25,921 --> 00:48:30,330
impulse on intuition or
an early result and uh,

777
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:33,310
and you say, this is, this
is going to work, this is,

778
00:48:33,330 --> 00:48:38,330
that's where the difference between
perseverance and self trickery is,

779
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:43,740
is very fragile.
It's very delicate.

780
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:49,110
And so I would say that
testing impartially,

781
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:52,320
finding a way to test him partially
whether what you're doing is,

782
00:48:52,410 --> 00:48:56,250
is really worth what you're doing and
the way you're doing it, et Cetera,

783
00:48:56,251 --> 00:48:56,880
et Cetera,

784
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:00,630
I think is a very difficult
one that people sometimes
take a heck of a long time

785
00:49:00,631 --> 00:49:05,280
to do and then sometimes the businesses
there, the money's there, et Cetera,

786
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:06,950
but essentially there,

787
00:49:07,090 --> 00:49:11,250
there was nothing really of substance
there and it might take you years and

788
00:49:11,251 --> 00:49:16,251
years of spinning your wheels to realize
it and sometimes when something does

789
00:49:16,351 --> 00:49:21,090
not go through in the end you start
remembering those small comments or those

790
00:49:21,091 --> 00:49:22,570
people who,

791
00:49:22,770 --> 00:49:27,600
who were naysayers all along who you
were just pushing it out of the weight in

792
00:49:27,601 --> 00:49:30,150
order to do what you had to do
because you knew it was right.

793
00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:33,960
This whole process of really
poking at what you're doing,

794
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:37,820
the product or the entity or
the time you're taking is a,

795
00:49:37,821 --> 00:49:42,150
is a disheartening process most of the
time because very few things really are,

796
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:48,270
are feasible and most of the
things will run for a while.

797
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:53,310
And I think that if you could poke at
that early on and be excessively, um,

798
00:49:53,610 --> 00:49:58,610
transparent and humble about whether that
that exists really as an opportunity,

799
00:49:58,861 --> 00:50:02,130
I think that would be the, by far
the most valuable thing you could do,

800
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:04,120
which you've,

801
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:09,120
which of your books would you
suggest say that's small organization

802
00:50:10,181 --> 00:50:15,181
entrepreneurs start with and which books
besides your own have you gifted the

803
00:50:15,761 --> 00:50:16,780
most to other people?

804
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:23,830
You know, the, the, the one that you
mentioned, the, the seven day weekend is,

805
00:50:24,330 --> 00:50:25,830
it is a good place to,

806
00:50:25,831 --> 00:50:30,831
as with many other books is it is a good
place to poke around also inside your

807
00:50:31,971 --> 00:50:36,230
own head and to look for some insights.
You know, in the end, when I, when I,

808
00:50:36,530 --> 00:50:40,400
when I wrote the book originally,
um, in and Brazil was,

809
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:45,580
was still a relatively closed at
elite environment for business people,

810
00:50:45,801 --> 00:50:49,400
et Cetera. So obviously because
the book has sold a good quantity,

811
00:50:49,401 --> 00:50:53,630
most people had read it and I was
kept giving autographs to taxi driver.

812
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:58,370
It was a very, very, a very small

813
00:51:00,050 --> 00:51:01,370
microcosm was living in.

814
00:51:01,371 --> 00:51:05,120
But I remember the second
occasion that has happened to me,

815
00:51:05,121 --> 00:51:09,050
which was being stopped on the
street and somebody saying, you know,

816
00:51:09,051 --> 00:51:10,730
I read your book and it changed my life.

817
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:14,190
And they would go off and quote
somebody else's book in time

818
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:19,970
when this happened the second
time I said, shit, this is,

819
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,750
this is not about me at
all. You know, this is, um,

820
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:26,720
so let me stop right here. Because,
and of course at that point,

821
00:51:26,770 --> 00:51:31,040
there was all kinds of campaigns for me
to run for mayor and for president and

822
00:51:31,041 --> 00:51:33,690
become Brazil's Trump,
you know, because this is,

823
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:39,380
people get lost along the way and they
start believing in their own bullshit,

824
00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:40,130
you know?
And,

825
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:44,690
and the interesting thing here was about
going back to the issue of the book was

826
00:51:44,691 --> 00:51:48,770
that, uh, it's when you, when
you come across an insight,

827
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:52,820
which was already yours, and you see
it in writing, that's when you say,

828
00:51:52,821 --> 00:51:54,590
this book changed my life.
You know,

829
00:51:55,010 --> 00:51:57,620
but really insights where you
go there and you said, Geez,

830
00:51:57,621 --> 00:51:58,490
I never thought of that.

831
00:51:58,491 --> 00:52:03,080
And there is some of that it has to add
to something that you believe in or that

832
00:52:03,081 --> 00:52:05,270
jives with your moment and so forth.

833
00:52:05,271 --> 00:52:10,271
So I think that I'm putting
too much weight and too
much importance on something

834
00:52:11,721 --> 00:52:13,500
that you got out of summer.
I got an insight,

835
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:19,090
doesn't remind us that this intuition
and this since I was growing inside you

836
00:52:19,701 --> 00:52:23,300
already, we're just waiting
for some clarification of it,

837
00:52:23,301 --> 00:52:26,670
but that kind of answers the second bit,
which is I,

838
00:52:26,770 --> 00:52:31,770
I taught for for several years at the
Sloan school at Mit and I had a group of

839
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:37,150
Mbas and as long as a very fun
group and I used to go there, um,

840
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:41,840
in the fall quarter and, um, and, and I,

841
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:42,621
I'd tell them,
look,

842
00:52:42,621 --> 00:52:47,360
this is what you have to read to
understand business and organizations.

843
00:52:47,361 --> 00:52:50,510
And so far it's time and I was of to

844
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:55,430
make this available on the
MIT side anyway and so forth.

845
00:52:55,460 --> 00:53:00,200
And then the books that were
there were Marco polos travel,

846
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:04,430
one book, uh, uh, CAFCA parable,

847
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:06,460
um,
a,

848
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:10,640
a yoga book on synchronicity and so forth.

849
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,410
And so these,

850
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:17,300
these kinds of books and calf
guy think is extraordinary. Um,

851
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:22,720
these kind of books I think give you an
enormous insight into the people who are

852
00:53:24,231 --> 00:53:27,050
doing things or why they're doing things.
Um,

853
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:31,530
rather than the whole set of
how to, you know, and when you,

854
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:36,740
when you run away from the how tos into
the issue of how you get to real wisdom.

855
00:53:38,071 --> 00:53:39,720
You know,
we've been at this for a long time.

856
00:53:39,721 --> 00:53:44,430
We've been in this agriculture and then
we were in the industrial area and then

857
00:53:44,431 --> 00:53:47,470
we were in the information age
and we were in the knowledge age,

858
00:53:47,610 --> 00:53:50,190
but we don't get any closer
to the age of wisdom.

859
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:52,960
And something is terribly
wrong for population.

860
00:53:52,961 --> 00:53:57,000
And then the humanity has been around
for so long and doesn't get closer to

861
00:53:57,001 --> 00:53:57,840
wisdom.
You know,

862
00:53:57,841 --> 00:54:02,841
when you think about organizations and
you ask you to show me one democratic

863
00:54:03,751 --> 00:54:08,310
organization or business
environment in the world,

864
00:54:08,311 --> 00:54:11,250
or to find one wise company as a company,
et Cetera,

865
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:16,500
these are all almost impossible to find.
So answering your question,

866
00:54:16,501 --> 00:54:20,370
I would say that the books
that stopped to think about,

867
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:23,880
why the heck do we do
the things that we do,

868
00:54:24,330 --> 00:54:28,050
which are in calf car and Freud
or in younger and thorough.

869
00:54:28,290 --> 00:54:33,290
I think that those will answer at business
world much closer than people think

870
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:36,780
when they say, okay, that's
all very good and well,

871
00:54:36,781 --> 00:54:40,950
but that's all philosophy and that's
all airy fairy and touchy feely.

872
00:54:40,951 --> 00:54:44,700
But I need to get down to answer this,
how come,

873
00:54:44,701 --> 00:54:48,840
which people how until Friday.
But this process I think is much,

874
00:54:48,841 --> 00:54:52,950
much stronger from a
philosophical point of what,

875
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:55,720
what makes you want to
get up in the morning, uh,

876
00:54:55,730 --> 00:54:59,430
and how you let the other people
around you do what they want to do,

877
00:54:59,431 --> 00:55:02,010
how they want to do it
and get out of their way.

878
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:06,210
And then that is a philosophical issue
that I think would solve a lot more

879
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:10,320
issues of people went from that filter
on, which, you know, definitely.

880
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:15,200
Do you have any particular
books or writing of Kafka that,

881
00:55:15,890 --> 00:55:19,470
uh, that come to mind that
you would recommend? Yeah,

882
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:23,100
there's one that I used
always there, which was, uh,

883
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:27,600
which was wonderful.
It's a collection of parables.

884
00:55:27,601 --> 00:55:30,240
There's only one and
there's a set of parents,

885
00:55:30,241 --> 00:55:34,130
but one of them is especially interesting
is called before the law number four.

886
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:36,300
The law is only three pages long.
And I used to,

887
00:55:37,230 --> 00:55:42,230
I used to sit on top of this teacher's
desk there in Cambridge and read this to

888
00:55:43,471 --> 00:55:45,810
the, to the kids, you know, the NBA kits.

889
00:55:45,811 --> 00:55:49,590
And this was really interesting because
I really felt like I was reading to my

890
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,650
small kids and I'd sit there and say,
let me read this to you.

891
00:55:52,651 --> 00:55:56,490
But the fact is it's only two and
a half pages long, but it just,

892
00:55:56,491 --> 00:56:00,600
it just tells a story of a guy
who sits in front of a door,

893
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:06,650
which is open and has this big guy who
is guarding the door and he's cost sack

894
00:56:07,141 --> 00:56:10,920
and he's closed this big for
Colton is enormous and he's scary.

895
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:16,260
And the guy asks him, um, uh, whether
he can go in and he says, sure,

896
00:56:16,261 --> 00:56:17,560
you can go into the doors open,

897
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:22,350
but don't forget to further on there's
another door with a guy who is scarier

898
00:56:22,351 --> 00:56:25,740
than I. And then another door and support.
And then the guy says, well, wait,

899
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:28,730
I think I was just waiting
a bit here. And, uh,

900
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:32,420
this goes on and on until this guy's
getting older and older and older.

901
00:56:32,421 --> 00:56:36,830
And then finally when he's about to die,
he's lying there on the floor.

902
00:56:37,050 --> 00:56:41,670
And then the guy,
the guard bends down and he says,

903
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:45,720
um, uh, and he asks the guard and he said,

904
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:50,310
now that I'm about to die and I have no
more forces to go through anyway, uh,

905
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:53,670
what is beyond that door? What's going
to happen to the guard? Says, well,

906
00:56:53,671 --> 00:56:56,960
this store, it was only for you
and since you are now going to die,

907
00:56:57,080 --> 00:57:00,810
I'm going to close it.
Okay. And it's a wonderful,

908
00:57:01,310 --> 00:57:05,100
a wonderful exercise
in realizing that each,

909
00:57:05,101 --> 00:57:08,490
for these doors that you did not go
through, we're only for you. Okay.

910
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:12,580
And everything that we're comparing
ourselves to all the time and the size of

911
00:57:12,581 --> 00:57:14,080
our businesses and the health of the,

912
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:17,950
the wealth of that and how good our
family is and how good our life is.

913
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:20,410
Whereas happiness,
whereas wisdom, et Cetera,

914
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:25,600
it all really answers this one issue that
this store is there only for you when,

915
00:57:25,601 --> 00:57:28,630
if you don't cross it, uh, it'll
close when you die, you know?

916
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:35,120
No, I, uh, I've been struck with how much
I was a nonfiction purist for a really,

917
00:57:35,121 --> 00:57:38,600
really long time and was fortunate
to have a few people intervene.

918
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:43,700
And the amount that I've taken
from books like Dune or Zorba,

919
00:57:43,701 --> 00:57:47,120
the Greek and since they're
told in a narrative form,

920
00:57:47,121 --> 00:57:50,720
have actually stuck compared to say,
the dryer in some cases.

921
00:57:50,721 --> 00:57:55,721
Nonfiction has just been extremely
eye opening and liberating for me.

922
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:58,520
I want to ask about,

923
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:04,610
or this is really a question from a fan.
So a Philippe Moist,

924
00:58:04,611 --> 00:58:07,670
I don't know how to pronounce his name,
but this is,

925
00:58:07,671 --> 00:58:12,410
this is a part of his question. Uh, so he
needs, is referring to you. He wants it.

926
00:58:12,411 --> 00:58:15,830
He made a big fire in his backyard and
burned every article, book, interview,

927
00:58:15,831 --> 00:58:20,510
everything he had done as a symbol to
not look back. Has this been done again?

928
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:25,370
And how is his relationship to the past?
So it, could you elaborate on this?

929
00:58:25,371 --> 00:58:29,960
I don't know if it's accurate or not,
but uh, if, if you could comment on that,

930
00:58:30,710 --> 00:58:31,970
I'd love to hear your thoughts.

931
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:36,570
Yeah. That was when I
turned 50, so I'm 57 now.

932
00:58:36,571 --> 00:58:41,370
So when I turned 50, um, I
looked at my, why Britain,

933
00:58:41,430 --> 00:58:43,940
I looked around me and so
forth and I said, shit,

934
00:58:43,941 --> 00:58:46,190
there's a lot of stuff on me here.
You know,

935
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:50,900
I have my books and all these languages,
38 languages. I have a thousand articles,

936
00:58:50,901 --> 00:58:54,560
I have DVDs, I have cds, I have even,
you know, of course the video, cause

937
00:58:56,390 --> 00:59:00,050
I don't even know I would play that.
But I had it and I said,

938
00:59:00,051 --> 00:59:03,460
there's something wrong with
this stuff, you know, one, um,

939
00:59:03,890 --> 00:59:05,900
I don't need it anymore for my ego.

940
00:59:05,901 --> 00:59:10,901
I think I'm all set or I need to figure
it out what my therapist but not here.

941
00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:13,510
And two, I have these five kids, you know,

942
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:16,970
we're going to run around a and suddenly
they're going to find that I'm larger

943
00:59:16,971 --> 00:59:20,280
than life and people are going to say,
well, are you going to follow your own?

944
00:59:20,310 --> 00:59:23,810
Are you going to run your dad's
company or going to? And I said,

945
00:59:23,811 --> 00:59:27,890
that's a terrible imposition to
make on them, you know? And so,

946
00:59:28,550 --> 00:59:31,040
um, I thought there were
two things holding me back.

947
00:59:31,041 --> 00:59:35,690
One of them was that if I remember that
I did this and I did that and I have

948
00:59:35,691 --> 00:59:38,360
this and I have that award
and I have to have that, um,

949
00:59:38,361 --> 00:59:42,710
I have a very wrong sense of very
superficial sense of, of who I am.

950
00:59:42,711 --> 00:59:47,510
So I thought that if I get rid
of all this stuff, I'm also, um,

951
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:50,360
a a lighter for the,
the,

952
00:59:50,361 --> 00:59:53,990
the trip that's in front of me and that
I can look good things from scratch and

953
00:59:53,991 --> 00:59:55,330
say, let's forget all that. What,

954
00:59:55,370 --> 01:00:00,200
what would I do now and how do I kind
of zero based my life from Huron?

955
01:00:00,201 --> 01:00:01,160
And two,

956
01:00:02,090 --> 01:00:06,860
I didn't want these kids to be burdened
by the idea that your dad this year,

957
01:00:06,861 --> 01:00:08,750
that that. So, um,

958
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:13,580
what we did was we just started a bonfire
in the backyard and it took us about

959
01:00:13,581 --> 01:00:17,720
five or six hours to burn everything.
We were just burned 100%.

960
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:21,470
And so just like your SD,
this is in Sao Paulo or where were you?

961
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:27,330
I live up in the mall. Just wondering
what your neighbors thought. Okay. Yeah,

962
01:00:28,730 --> 01:00:31,570
they didn't call the, the, the fireman.

963
01:00:31,990 --> 01:00:34,040
So we just spent hours,

964
01:00:34,041 --> 01:00:36,740
Bernie on this time and it takes a hell
of a lot longer than I thought it did.

965
01:00:36,741 --> 01:00:40,760
And, and VHS tapes don't burn very
well and a lot of black smoke.

966
01:00:40,910 --> 01:00:42,500
So we get hours of this.

967
01:00:42,501 --> 01:00:47,501
And so it's now been seven years since
there is no shred of anything of mine in

968
01:00:49,011 --> 01:00:52,630
the house anywhere in that respect.
And the good part about it is,

969
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:57,410
is my five kids, they really don't
have the slightest idea what I do. And,

970
01:00:57,411 --> 01:01:00,270
uh, and if you ask them,
someone might say, I'm a writer,

971
01:01:00,271 --> 01:01:02,600
or some might say I don't do very much.
And I'm like,

972
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:05,630
I've never taken them to a company.

973
01:01:05,631 --> 01:01:10,160
I've never told them that one
day this could be yours. And, um,

974
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:11,150
so they,

975
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:16,070
it never entered their mind that they
know that we have money because they

976
01:01:16,071 --> 01:01:20,150
couldn't look around. But they've also
learned from the very beginning that they,

977
01:01:20,151 --> 01:01:24,740
they've gone to public school with
kids who have nothing whatsoever at all

978
01:01:24,741 --> 01:01:28,610
along. They go to the house
of these kids were very, um,

979
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:32,630
humble and they've just learned
to accept that there's luck.

980
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:34,700
There is luck when you bought
it. You're, you're, you're,

981
01:01:34,701 --> 01:01:37,290
you're born in a family that has money.

982
01:01:37,370 --> 01:01:41,480
There's other things that are talent
and the kid plays soccer 10 times better

983
01:01:41,481 --> 01:01:45,740
than you. And if they've found
that there are other variations,

984
01:01:45,770 --> 01:01:50,240
but the one of, uh, your
father's this or that,

985
01:01:50,270 --> 01:01:53,720
that one they'd,
they've never caught up on.

986
01:01:53,721 --> 01:01:57,320
And so that was the whole rationale back
there. And I'm very happy that I did it.

987
01:01:57,321 --> 01:02:00,920
Now I don't need to, every seven
years do anything because of course,

988
01:02:00,921 --> 01:02:04,280
nothing else comes in.
Anything I get, uh, we,

989
01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:05,990
we throw out as it comes in,

990
01:02:05,991 --> 01:02:10,130
anything that has my name or is it
about me or is from you, etc. We just,

991
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:13,640
we don't keep it.
And that way it keeps relatively clean.

992
01:02:14,190 --> 01:02:18,530
I want to come back to the parable and
the door and the door's being yours and

993
01:02:18,531 --> 01:02:20,010
yours alone.
This trap that

994
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:23,850
some people fall into in
terms of comparison and
keeping up with the Joneses.

995
01:02:23,970 --> 01:02:28,560
And just as context for people,
I live in silicon valley,

996
01:02:28,561 --> 01:02:33,390
for those who don't know and irregularly
interact with people who might have net

997
01:02:33,391 --> 01:02:37,980
worths of hundreds of millions of dollars
who are miserable because the other

998
01:02:37,981 --> 01:02:41,400
person with hundreds of millions or maybe
billions has a larger jet than they do

999
01:02:41,401 --> 01:02:44,860
or something like that.
And I'm looking at various

1000
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:51,240
right yachts or fill in
the blank pissing contest.

1001
01:02:51,690 --> 01:02:55,200
And I'm looking at the notes that I made.

1002
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:58,980
I must have been in 2003 in the
seven day weekend. So we have,

1003
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:02,730
I'll just give you a couple of samples.
One 68 find talent than opportunity,

1004
01:03:02,731 --> 01:03:06,090
not job description.
Then talent 71 the reason for work,

1005
01:03:06,091 --> 01:03:09,300
one oh four Max personal
wealth is 12 million.

1006
01:03:09,301 --> 01:03:13,320
That's what I'm going to dig into in
a second one 23 no more than six month

1007
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:18,450
business plan or or a six month
plans versus long term plans.

1008
01:03:18,450 --> 01:03:21,120
And I have dozens of these,

1009
01:03:21,121 --> 01:03:26,121
but what I wanted to do is
turn to 104 because that uh,

1010
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:26,401
I,

1011
01:03:26,401 --> 01:03:31,401
I'd love to read a small piece of and
then just to hear you perhaps elaborate on

1012
01:03:31,801 --> 01:03:34,790
it and perhaps your thoughts
have changed somewhat, uh, to,

1013
01:03:35,010 --> 01:03:39,390
to hear is just find out
whether I actually wrote it
myself or not yet. Exactly,

1014
01:03:39,540 --> 01:03:42,940
exactly. So this is the
paperback. This is on one oh four.

1015
01:03:43,830 --> 01:03:46,620
I have a theory about wealth.
My friends just sigh when they hear this.

1016
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:50,190
My theory is that the maximum
personal wealth is $12 million.

1017
01:03:50,250 --> 01:03:53,490
And I've done some calculations with
economists to bear out this capitalistic

1018
01:03:53,491 --> 01:03:57,270
and admittedly provocative number, not
a cent over 12 million. After that,

1019
01:03:57,271 --> 01:03:58,410
all millionaires are the same.

1020
01:03:58,411 --> 01:04:00,630
And then I'm going to jump down
and I'm skipping a few paragraphs,

1021
01:04:00,631 --> 01:04:03,330
but you call this the Davinci constraint.

1022
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:07,490
And then the example is a neighbor,
a neighbor of mine in Sao Paulo,

1023
01:04:07,530 --> 01:04:10,440
built a house that reminds me of a
South American dictators compound.

1024
01:04:10,710 --> 01:04:13,710
He may have spent his entire
allotment of 12 billion on this house,

1025
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:17,430
but now his problem is Leonardo who
points out that human cannot possibly feel

1026
01:04:17,431 --> 01:04:20,550
at ease in such a disproportionate house.
Certainly my neighbor can live,

1027
01:04:20,551 --> 01:04:24,240
they're open at two photographers from
design magazines and be admired from afar.

1028
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:27,540
But in winter he'll huddle in the
tiny TV room on the second floor,

1029
01:04:27,541 --> 01:04:32,420
withdrawing from the cavernous rooms to
seek a more human scale. And then Jay,

1030
01:04:32,580 --> 01:04:36,390
I'm going to bump down another
two paragraphs. And uh, I really,

1031
01:04:36,590 --> 01:04:40,080
I like this lion a lot, which is
collecting money as like a massing.

1032
01:04:40,081 --> 01:04:44,010
Any other item, by definition, no
collector can ever be happy. So I was,

1033
01:04:44,090 --> 01:04:47,290
I'd love to just hear your
thoughts on this and uh, if, if,

1034
01:04:47,340 --> 01:04:52,340
if they've changed it all because this
is something that a or it's a temptation.

1035
01:04:53,491 --> 01:04:56,520
This is comparison and growth
for the sake of growth. More,

1036
01:04:56,521 --> 01:05:01,410
I need more and more and more. That leads
a lot of people to be very miserable.

1037
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:05,640
Uh, could you, could you
just elaborate on, uh,

1038
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:06,713
on this thinking?

1039
01:05:07,210 --> 01:05:11,770
I think nowadays when you,
and this is what this is about,

1040
01:05:11,771 --> 01:05:14,330
15 years old or something.
Yeah, a little bit less. Um,

1041
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:17,980
I think in these,
in last decade

1042
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:18,730
and a half left,

1043
01:05:18,730 --> 01:05:22,480
I think that the number of people who
have come to realize or to accept the

1044
01:05:22,481 --> 01:05:27,481
intellectual concept that money doesn't
buy happiness and a growing for growth's

1045
01:05:29,171 --> 01:05:33,330
sake and comparing yourself to everyone
else ends badly. And I think about it,

1046
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:36,910
people have accepted this as a thought
and then something in the back of their

1047
01:05:36,911 --> 01:05:38,700
mind says, yeah, but you know,

1048
01:05:38,710 --> 01:05:42,670
if I had a 12 or 20 or $50 million,

1049
01:05:42,910 --> 01:05:44,560
everything would be a lot easier.

1050
01:05:44,561 --> 01:05:46,870
And it's only these guys
who really have the money,

1051
01:05:47,230 --> 01:05:51,450
who keep bullshitting about how money
is not important. This is the right,

1052
01:05:51,670 --> 01:05:55,990
this is where, this is how it, how
it comes down with after so much,

1053
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:58,000
so much time thinking about this.

1054
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:02,230
Basically we're in a world post 1989,

1055
01:06:02,231 --> 01:06:05,830
let's say when the Berlin Wall came
down, we're in a world that says, oh,

1056
01:06:05,831 --> 01:06:07,120
capitalism has won.

1057
01:06:07,450 --> 01:06:12,300
So there was no such thing anymore as
soviets and communists and so forth. This,

1058
01:06:12,370 --> 01:06:14,440
this stuff we've now proved in the world,

1059
01:06:14,441 --> 01:06:19,441
has proven that money is the
real kingdom of the world,

1060
01:06:19,481 --> 01:06:23,140
is a monarchy and the
king is money. And, uh,

1061
01:06:23,170 --> 01:06:27,930
of course guys who do this
better than other people, uh,

1062
01:06:28,090 --> 01:06:31,240
have now taken this to new proportions,
which is natural.

1063
01:06:31,241 --> 01:06:34,690
It's just doing more and more and
more and more of the same. So if I,

1064
01:06:34,990 --> 01:06:39,430
if my house were big enough
to huddle to 300 people,

1065
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:43,240
and these were some of the people
from around your house, let's say,

1066
01:06:43,241 --> 01:06:46,720
and some of the, most of, some of
the wealthiest people in the world.

1067
01:06:46,721 --> 01:06:50,290
And I were to invite them over for
dinner and they were to accept,

1068
01:06:50,770 --> 01:06:53,410
I would have it, my dinner. Uh,

1069
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:57,310
the wealth equivalent to half
of the population of the world.

1070
01:06:57,311 --> 01:06:59,560
So I couldn't have in that that dinner,

1071
01:07:00,010 --> 01:07:04,390
people who have more money than three or
three and a half billion people around

1072
01:07:04,391 --> 01:07:09,391
the world now that is money
is king rationale taken to
its most logical extent.

1073
01:07:12,010 --> 01:07:13,180
And uh,

1074
01:07:13,270 --> 01:07:18,270
and I started asking myself and a task
on a Ted talk and it was the line that

1075
01:07:19,391 --> 01:07:22,000
that got the most reaction
from people over time,

1076
01:07:22,001 --> 01:07:26,890
which was if you're giving back,
it's because you've taken too much.

1077
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:32,160
And, and, and people are, you
know, I have to give back to that.

1078
01:07:32,170 --> 01:07:35,380
When you think about this and you say, you
know, one of your is not your neighbor,

1079
01:07:35,381 --> 01:07:39,910
he's in Seattle, but let's say the Bill
Gates. So, or, or her Warren Buffet,

1080
01:07:39,911 --> 01:07:42,770
Warren Buffet says, boy, you know, I've
been so good at this stuff. You know,

1081
01:07:42,790 --> 01:07:46,500
that I've now made according to
his calculation a few years ago,

1082
01:07:46,501 --> 01:07:51,400
I now made $30 billion more than I need.
Oh, okay. So what am I going to do this,

1083
01:07:51,401 --> 01:07:55,600
let me give it to people who really need
it and so forth with he gave it to Bill

1084
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:57,690
Gates, right? Right. This was the,

1085
01:07:57,820 --> 01:08:02,170
this was the full Russia
now and so there's something
wrong with people who have

1086
01:08:02,171 --> 01:08:03,820
a lot of excess money of course,

1087
01:08:04,210 --> 01:08:09,210
because you're saying let's find someone
who's already trampling around Africa

1088
01:08:09,371 --> 01:08:12,550
and meeting tribes and trying to
give money to aids and so forth.

1089
01:08:12,550 --> 01:08:15,070
But the fact is that once you start,

1090
01:08:16,190 --> 01:08:18,650
you're caught in this collection mode,

1091
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:22,550
which is you'll always find a reason
for thinking. You need more of that,

1092
01:08:22,970 --> 01:08:25,250
but it is taking away from something.

1093
01:08:25,370 --> 01:08:29,090
It's taking away from your kids or it's
taking away from sitting in the backyard

1094
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:31,670
and reading another book or
it's taking from somewhere.

1095
01:08:31,671 --> 01:08:34,820
There's no such thing as a,

1096
01:08:34,850 --> 01:08:38,240
I will work harder for a time and then
I will have the money and then we'll,

1097
01:08:38,241 --> 01:08:41,510
and then everything will be all right
because that moment never arrives.

1098
01:08:41,511 --> 01:08:44,390
And I think people realize that evermore.
They just,

1099
01:08:44,780 --> 01:08:49,780
people in general of course feel that
there is a level of comfort that in your

1100
01:08:52,071 --> 01:08:56,150
mind about your worries about the future
and the money's in the mortgages and so

1101
01:08:56,151 --> 01:09:01,070
forth that will, boy, if you could
have that least that it, you'd be okay.

1102
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:05,840
This 12 million almost parable
rationale was to say, look,

1103
01:09:05,841 --> 01:09:10,841
let's put at least an upper limit on this
at a point where the have a house here

1104
01:09:12,741 --> 01:09:14,330
in apartment there and
something on the beach,

1105
01:09:14,331 --> 01:09:17,940
on some of the animal and then having an
and do anything you want and go to long

1106
01:09:17,941 --> 01:09:22,700
vacations in Paris. That was at that time
that you'd have to bring it up to date,

1107
01:09:22,701 --> 01:09:24,590
but it was Tom and the
doctors did everything.

1108
01:09:24,591 --> 01:09:27,650
There was nothing you could
not do it Tillman from then on,

1109
01:09:28,010 --> 01:09:32,810
this was an issue of a
ego vanity or obsession.

1110
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:35,780
It was something else too and it no
longer had anything to do with money.

1111
01:09:36,110 --> 01:09:37,280
On the lower end.

1112
01:09:37,470 --> 01:09:42,470
You see all these guys who are doing
work on finding a happiness levels and

1113
01:09:42,621 --> 01:09:46,250
serotonin levels and what it
takes to be minimally happy.

1114
01:09:47,270 --> 01:09:52,270
But people are always looking in India
at the people who are untouchable and so

1115
01:09:52,821 --> 01:09:56,480
forth and finding, uh, levels
of happiness that are high.

1116
01:09:56,481 --> 01:10:00,650
And so I think people kind of
accept the idea intellectually,

1117
01:10:01,190 --> 01:10:03,500
but that I think the feeling
inside is always okay,

1118
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:07,860
but I had only 200 grand more or finally
this then everything would be okay.

1119
01:10:08,110 --> 01:10:10,880
I think that that isn't going away,
Tim,

1120
01:10:10,881 --> 01:10:14,300
in the sense that I don't think humanity
is getting wiser and slowly we'll

1121
01:10:14,301 --> 01:10:17,090
realize,
but intellectually was the first step,

1122
01:10:17,091 --> 01:10:21,500
which I think humanity took and now
starts to accept every time more that

1123
01:10:21,501 --> 01:10:25,070
there's something dramatically
wrong with zero 1%.

1124
01:10:25,071 --> 01:10:28,670
It's not even the 1% but zero
1% having such tremendous,

1125
01:10:28,671 --> 01:10:33,671
well end this whole amassing wealth
because the wealth is going to the smarter

1126
01:10:33,681 --> 01:10:38,220
guys and the smarter guys are the smarter
guys who are able to siphon money, uh,

1127
01:10:38,221 --> 01:10:42,230
away from everything else into
their own pockets. I'm on.

1128
01:10:42,231 --> 01:10:46,460
It's a very dismal situation.
And you come to think about it today.

1129
01:10:46,461 --> 01:10:49,220
You think about reading and thinking
about the past a little bit, Tim,

1130
01:10:49,610 --> 01:10:54,610
you think about the robber barons like
Rockefeller and Carnegie and Vanderbilt.

1131
01:10:55,370 --> 01:10:58,370
These guys were all a monopoly players.
You know,

1132
01:10:58,371 --> 01:11:01,910
these are the guys who were setting up
trusts and almost everything that they

1133
01:11:01,911 --> 01:11:06,080
did at the time would be illegal
today. Now, these barren Roy,

1134
01:11:06,090 --> 01:11:10,460
these robber barons are people that we
somehow or other are very impressed with.

1135
01:11:10,461 --> 01:11:13,690
You know, we'd love to be today, uh,

1136
01:11:14,850 --> 01:11:17,940
called to dinner,
buy by one of these rubber barons.

1137
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:21,570
But is there a dramatic difference today,
Tim,

1138
01:11:21,571 --> 01:11:26,520
when you think about it in the biggest
corporations in the world and these

1139
01:11:26,521 --> 01:11:28,530
people,
many of the people who started

1140
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:32,510
writing code and doing
wonderful things and so forth,

1141
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:37,740
which are now all about
monopolies and trusts. And, uh,

1142
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:41,010
suddenly the guy like Trump says,

1143
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:44,150
come to Washington and play with me
and everybody says, where's my play?

1144
01:11:44,151 --> 01:11:45,180
And I'm ready to play.

1145
01:11:45,630 --> 01:11:49,500
There's something wrong with this whole
process because money keeps calling

1146
01:11:49,501 --> 01:11:53,070
money. And it makes very, uh,

1147
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:58,100
very disappointing people out of the
ones who've been seeking money as a big

1148
01:11:58,350 --> 01:11:59,820
issue, money, power and so forth.

1149
01:12:00,180 --> 01:12:03,990
And you've seen it in all the films you've
read it and all the books you've seen

1150
01:12:03,991 --> 01:12:06,450
it with people, you know,
it doesn't end well,

1151
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:11,660
but it doesn't stop any of these people
giving up other things in favor of that

1152
01:12:13,021 --> 01:12:18,021
which in a money world and
[inaudible] king oriented money world,

1153
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:19,440
uh,
people seek.

1154
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:22,860
And that's the bit that I think
most people have found to be silly,

1155
01:12:23,190 --> 01:12:24,620
but there's still chasing somehow.

1156
01:12:24,630 --> 01:12:26,550
And that's was the whole
bit about the tournament.

1157
01:12:26,551 --> 01:12:30,960
And how do you use the question,
what for

1158
01:12:33,810 --> 01:12:36,750
when you, when you do the three
why's in a row and so forth,

1159
01:12:36,751 --> 01:12:41,160
you end up with a
process questions and um,

1160
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:44,050
and they're, they're very good for, um,

1161
01:12:44,370 --> 01:12:46,990
removing obstacles and things that,

1162
01:12:47,370 --> 01:12:51,440
that are silly that you do or that
you're involved in doing. But, um,

1163
01:12:51,690 --> 01:12:53,840
it still doesn't answer the,

1164
01:12:53,910 --> 01:12:58,910
the question that has to do with wisdom
and that one is what the hell far am I

1165
01:12:59,101 --> 01:13:00,750
doing this?
And that's a very,

1166
01:13:00,751 --> 01:13:05,751
very tough one because
you could eventually even
answered the three whys of for

1167
01:13:05,851 --> 01:13:08,040
a process or for way of doing things.

1168
01:13:08,060 --> 01:13:12,750
And you can fix that by asking the
three why's in a row. But when you,

1169
01:13:12,870 --> 01:13:14,340
when you answer,

1170
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:19,560
try to answer in your marriage with your
kids in the place where you would work

1171
01:13:19,681 --> 01:13:22,140
at the chorus,
you go toward the church that you attend,

1172
01:13:22,590 --> 01:13:27,390
when you start trying to answer what
I'm doing this for, then I think you're,

1173
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:30,240
you're getting to the,
to the religious and things,

1174
01:13:30,241 --> 01:13:33,260
but you're also getting into
real trouble because that,

1175
01:13:33,330 --> 01:13:38,010
those are the really difficult ones
to ask. There's, there's really,

1176
01:13:38,070 --> 01:13:42,360
all of us have only one question
in the world in our lifetime,

1177
01:13:42,370 --> 01:13:45,480
and one kid of mine asked
me that when he was three,

1178
01:13:45,481 --> 01:13:47,940
the other one is four and one.

1179
01:13:47,941 --> 01:13:52,320
We're sitting in a Jacuzzi when he's
three and he said that, why do we exist?

1180
01:13:52,470 --> 01:13:54,930
There's nothing else to
ask and there's nothing,

1181
01:13:55,020 --> 01:13:57,540
there's no other question to
ask for the rest of your life.

1182
01:13:58,040 --> 01:13:59,670
It will never answer it.
And so forth.

1183
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:04,230
And this issue of what
for am I doing this?

1184
01:14:04,530 --> 01:14:08,460
Why am I waking up in the morning?
I go through this and why am I doing,

1185
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,750
what am I doing a podcast for?

1186
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:16,560
What good is this going to do? And
going further because you'll say, oh,

1187
01:14:16,561 --> 01:14:17,071
because you know,

1188
01:14:17,071 --> 01:14:22,071
I want to help people and I want all
these people to make their lives better as

1189
01:14:23,810 --> 01:14:27,640
you know. Okay. But what for? Oh, you
know, so that the humanity will be better.

1190
01:14:27,641 --> 01:14:28,900
What for? Oh, what for?

1191
01:14:28,901 --> 01:14:33,901
Because essentially I cannot live with
the idea that I'm not making the world

1192
01:14:34,551 --> 01:14:39,220
slightly better than it
was, uh, when I was born,

1193
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:42,680
even though, uh, chances are, and,

1194
01:14:42,681 --> 01:14:45,370
and statistics tells you this
is not the case at all, but I,

1195
01:14:45,540 --> 01:14:49,860
but for me to feel that way, I need to go
do this. So I needed to do the podcast.

1196
01:14:49,861 --> 01:14:52,890
I need to write a book,
I need to speak at need to do all this.

1197
01:14:53,250 --> 01:14:57,870
But it's not because I hope that
people are now driving the car.

1198
01:14:57,871 --> 01:15:01,500
They'll suddenly stop and get out and
skip and jump to the house and say,

1199
01:15:01,501 --> 01:15:05,400
I've found new ways to do everything in
my life and everything we'd better from

1200
01:15:05,401 --> 01:15:09,870
wrong. But it's about my feeling
that I'm, I'm being useless.

1201
01:15:09,871 --> 01:15:13,270
And so this whole,
what four issue is,

1202
01:15:13,271 --> 01:15:17,600
is used for that as a key
to try and answer really why
you do the things you do,

1203
01:15:19,020 --> 01:15:23,060
what people listening.
You're very well spoken guy.

1204
01:15:23,061 --> 01:15:26,420
So they might look at your track record,
look at the accolades,

1205
01:15:26,770 --> 01:15:30,470
listen to you speak and imagine that,
uh,

1206
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:33,500
you always been confident,
always known what to do.

1207
01:15:34,160 --> 01:15:37,550
Could you share any particular dark,

1208
01:15:37,580 --> 01:15:42,580
difficult times or time that comes to
mind and how you found your way out of

1209
01:15:43,221 --> 01:15:44,020
that?

1210
01:15:44,020 --> 01:15:48,530
And on several occasions I've been,
let's say, close to the brink of,

1211
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:53,910
of things, um, not working to a
point of undoing everything. So, uh,

1212
01:15:54,380 --> 01:15:59,180
a few years after I started was
the first time I, I ran into,

1213
01:15:59,550 --> 01:16:02,920
you know, we rented it to
such a financial difficulties.

1214
01:16:02,950 --> 01:16:07,950
I remembers specifically driving
to the plant and thinking what it,

1215
01:16:08,871 --> 01:16:13,730
what it would take and what it would
mean that people have to talk to, to, um,

1216
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:14,360
to,

1217
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:19,360
to take the company into receivership
lists or the company was going broke and

1218
01:16:19,521 --> 01:16:22,230
what would I do as, and
that was to me, the, the,

1219
01:16:22,490 --> 01:16:27,170
the closest I ever got to the end, let's
say, because I was the only, I don't know,

1220
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:31,970
21, 22 and suddenly everything I tried to
do was completely wrong or was working.

1221
01:16:32,540 --> 01:16:36,200
And, uh, we came close to
the brink at that point.

1222
01:16:36,260 --> 01:16:40,700
And so what I found, I
think in, in that, and some,

1223
01:16:40,730 --> 01:16:41,960
some moments later,
I've never,

1224
01:16:41,990 --> 01:16:46,820
we had never come to that same
financials to Trish and, uh,

1225
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:48,410
anymore.
Exactly.

1226
01:16:48,890 --> 01:16:53,890
But I'd come to that situation looking
at a marriage is looking at how I was

1227
01:16:55,140 --> 01:16:56,120
raising kids,

1228
01:16:56,121 --> 01:17:01,121
looking at the opportunity to have a
much richer life and finding myself stuck

1229
01:17:02,421 --> 01:17:07,160
in the old traps that I'd set for myself
of doing things that I still had to do

1230
01:17:07,180 --> 01:17:11,150
because I said I was going to do them
and trying to, and so this whole process,

1231
01:17:11,330 --> 01:17:16,330
I think there were many dark moments
in which a four in front of let's say,

1232
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:22,860
family or business or
a wife or, or, or, um,

1233
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:27,680
choices for roads were, uh, looking back,

1234
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:30,940
I realized either that,
uh,

1235
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:35,980
it wasn't as dark as I thought it was
and I was just scaring myself into things

1236
01:17:36,740 --> 01:17:40,480
or to that I was,
luckily I got through that,

1237
01:17:40,740 --> 01:17:44,680
that bend in the road, et Cetera. So the
answer answers, first of all, no, there's,

1238
01:17:44,690 --> 01:17:47,540
it's far from easy,

1239
01:17:47,541 --> 01:17:52,150
even though I've been terribly
lucky all along. And so, uh, if,

1240
01:17:52,151 --> 01:17:52,761
if you say,

1241
01:17:52,761 --> 01:17:57,650
let me tell me the story of the 10
companies that you started that went bust.

1242
01:17:58,100 --> 01:18:01,520
That's easy because there's
more than 10, uh, the,

1243
01:18:01,550 --> 01:18:05,030
the amount of people that you've put
together to do something that became

1244
01:18:05,031 --> 01:18:05,864
nothing.

1245
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:11,020
The kind of hopes you had four things
that you are going to do that went

1246
01:18:11,241 --> 01:18:14,840
nowhere. You know? And, and
I've written plays, I've,

1247
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:19,280
I've put on plays and then
spent a year in the theater.

1248
01:18:19,550 --> 01:18:24,290
We're learning all about drama and
putting place together and so forth.

1249
01:18:24,590 --> 01:18:28,220
And I've been lucky enough that most
of this stuff kind of wanders off or is

1250
01:18:28,221 --> 01:18:33,060
reasonably acceptable so that I
can move on. And I think that the,

1251
01:18:33,090 --> 01:18:37,850
the real fears are always when you, you
know, somebody calls you and says, Oh,

1252
01:18:37,851 --> 01:18:42,280
you're the, for example, this two or
three weeks ago somebody called me and I,

1253
01:18:42,370 --> 01:18:46,850
my older kid was snowboarding and he says,
I'm calling you from the hospital.

1254
01:18:46,850 --> 01:18:48,680
We have to operate on your son.
You know,

1255
01:18:48,980 --> 01:18:53,000
things like that where your whole life
just kind of falls apart beneath you.

1256
01:18:53,001 --> 01:18:54,680
You go and do it needs to be done,

1257
01:18:55,100 --> 01:19:00,050
but you realize how fragile it is to
think that you're successful and you have

1258
01:19:00,051 --> 01:19:03,030
these big houses and you have all these
people working for you and so forth.

1259
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:07,700
But this stuff is all very,
very delicate and very fragile.

1260
01:19:07,701 --> 01:19:10,640
So I think there was a lot of dark
moments in which you realize what,

1261
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:16,070
what little it takes for you to kind of
lose everything that you were standing

1262
01:19:16,071 --> 01:19:17,000
on.
You know?

1263
01:19:17,950 --> 01:19:19,470
Are there any,
let's say,

1264
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:24,480
philosophies or principals that you
rely on to handle those situations when

1265
01:19:27,130 --> 01:19:31,150
you're reminded of how fragile things
are or uncertainty strikes or fortune

1266
01:19:31,180 --> 01:19:35,590
blows in a direction that throws
things seemingly off, off balance?

1267
01:19:37,220 --> 01:19:40,520
Yeah. I have, I have a kind of a

1268
01:19:42,220 --> 01:19:47,220
nurturing and unwavering
belief that we're very,

1269
01:19:48,891 --> 01:19:53,240
very insignificant and had really no
idea what's going on and we're not,

1270
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:54,351
we're not given,

1271
01:19:54,351 --> 01:19:57,680
it's not given to us to
understand anything that's
really important. You know,

1272
01:19:57,681 --> 01:20:01,130
any,
anything that you say is really,

1273
01:20:01,131 --> 01:20:05,780
really fundamental in life. We know
nothing about, we know nothing about love.

1274
01:20:05,781 --> 01:20:09,960
We know nothing about, we know know
the all the really important things.

1275
01:20:09,961 --> 01:20:11,000
We don't know.
He should take an hour.

1276
01:20:11,010 --> 01:20:13,080
You'd go to a doctor and
you go for a second opinion.

1277
01:20:13,081 --> 01:20:16,110
That sort of being et cetera.
You will always realize that.

1278
01:20:16,410 --> 01:20:18,600
The first question though, first, why man,

1279
01:20:18,610 --> 01:20:21,300
do I have this where you have this
because you're a nerve on this, the debt,

1280
01:20:21,570 --> 01:20:26,310
the second when et Cetera, but the third
y to any doctor is that we don't know,

1281
01:20:26,540 --> 01:20:30,300
right? Everything is that we don't
know anything that is really important.

1282
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:35,580
We don't know. Um, and so my feeling
is that because of this, this,

1283
01:20:35,610 --> 01:20:38,100
uh, insignificance,
which is the, let's say,

1284
01:20:38,101 --> 01:20:42,120
paired with the fact that we're terribly
important to ourselves and we're almost

1285
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:44,130
a hundred percent of our
importance to ourselves. Uh,

1286
01:20:44,460 --> 01:20:47,430
we're also insignificant any other regard.
And we noticed that when,

1287
01:20:47,770 --> 01:20:50,970
when somebody passes away or
when we remember something to,

1288
01:20:50,971 --> 01:20:55,110
we'd forgotten entirely that this
stuff is all becomes dust very quickly.

1289
01:20:55,560 --> 01:21:00,420
And so my feeling when, when things
are darker going badly or is that,

1290
01:21:00,780 --> 01:21:04,590
um,
it doesn't seem reasonable to me.

1291
01:21:04,591 --> 01:21:09,270
It never seemed reasonable to me
to for things to go completely are.

1292
01:21:09,780 --> 01:21:11,760
And so I,
my feeling is that,

1293
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:17,010
I'm sorry to go completely one Ari.
I mean going completely wrong,

1294
01:21:17,011 --> 01:21:19,350
are going completely south and you know,

1295
01:21:20,670 --> 01:21:23,640
and my feeling there Tim, is
that, you know, if you're,

1296
01:21:24,180 --> 01:21:27,150
if you're really not
spending most of your time,

1297
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:32,340
I'm tricking people into
things and finding uh,

1298
01:21:32,430 --> 01:21:36,880
ways on the side to make things work
or to make money and you're not, um,

1299
01:21:37,170 --> 01:21:41,610
you're doing your, your basic,
uh, humanity is basic in place.

1300
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,910
My feeling is that you'll be alright,
you'll be alright.

1301
01:21:44,911 --> 01:21:47,610
And I think that's what carries
me through in the end. Now,

1302
01:21:48,450 --> 01:21:52,260
it's not religious,
it's not structured in any form,

1303
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:56,280
but it's this kind of feeling that you
don't have to do all that much just to

1304
01:21:56,281 --> 01:22:01,140
Plod along without, um, without being,

1305
01:22:01,410 --> 01:22:02,380
um,

1306
01:22:04,710 --> 01:22:07,200
I'd say it's not even a naive,
you know,

1307
01:22:07,201 --> 01:22:11,010
so the whole rationale of
every time we have these small,

1308
01:22:11,330 --> 01:22:12,390
the choices,

1309
01:22:13,110 --> 01:22:16,470
the whole day long and by week and
month and years as we don't buy,

1310
01:22:16,980 --> 01:22:21,980
it's very easy to differentiate between
that which is a little bit less self

1311
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:28,830
serving and that which is, um,
which is only for your own good.

1312
01:22:29,070 --> 01:22:30,840
And if you make enough
of these choices along,

1313
01:22:30,841 --> 01:22:34,410
I think that at these dark moments
where it is moments of enormous risk,

1314
01:22:34,830 --> 01:22:37,600
it's kind of like a destiny or an,
uh,

1315
01:22:37,630 --> 01:22:41,070
a balanced that is in place and that
takes care of you somehow. You know?

1316
01:22:43,660 --> 01:22:46,400
So on a semi related notes,

1317
01:22:47,390 --> 01:22:49,740
is there any particular,
uh,

1318
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,820
challenge or goal that
you're facing right now?

1319
01:22:52,821 --> 01:22:55,190
You could choose any
personal or professional

1320
01:22:56,930 --> 01:23:00,020
that you could describe and how you're,
how you're tackling it,

1321
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:01,100
how you're going about it.

1322
01:23:01,750 --> 01:23:03,220
The other day I told my wife,

1323
01:23:03,930 --> 01:23:06,940
I think I said this at a
talk or something that I'm,

1324
01:23:07,450 --> 01:23:11,170
that I'm facing an empty
bucket list, you know, and,

1325
01:23:13,300 --> 01:23:18,100
and my empty bucket list is all about
saying this, that, um, you know,

1326
01:23:18,140 --> 01:23:19,840
my family has all,

1327
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:26,110
everyone in my trauma had melanoma.
I had a former, very drastic cancer,

1328
01:23:26,590 --> 01:23:30,790
which is very quick. And,
um, and I don't know, 15,

1329
01:23:30,791 --> 01:23:35,791
20 years ago I was already a scanned and
they told me it's a time where we did

1330
01:23:36,401 --> 01:23:39,910
that on a hundred percent
chance of melanoma and cancer.

1331
01:23:39,911 --> 01:23:43,880
And I've actually had it two, three times
and then in the meantime, but if you,

1332
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:47,590
if you watch out for it,
of course you can be quick and remove it.

1333
01:23:47,591 --> 01:23:51,610
And I just had surgery again about three,
four months ago,

1334
01:23:51,611 --> 01:23:55,720
found a new one and it, there's nothing
to it really. You, you identify,

1335
01:23:55,721 --> 01:23:58,660
you know what it looks like. You go
there, you have it removed and off you go.

1336
01:23:58,930 --> 01:24:03,880
But I kept thinking, uh, you know,
sitting in front of my, my oncologist,

1337
01:24:03,881 --> 01:24:06,880
my cancer doctor looking at me and
saying, well, Ricardo, this time it went,

1338
01:24:07,180 --> 01:24:07,841
you didn't see it.

1339
01:24:07,841 --> 01:24:12,700
It was on there in your back and you
have three months left or six months. And

1340
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:18,310
it happened to my parents and
two people to others before them.

1341
01:24:18,450 --> 01:24:20,350
And I kept thinking she's,

1342
01:24:20,351 --> 01:24:23,830
I don't want to be in that situation
where suddenly now I have to go to ball

1343
01:24:23,831 --> 01:24:26,550
games with the kids and now
I have to travel to places.

1344
01:24:26,551 --> 01:24:29,310
I haven't been enough to write that play,
which I know we're rolling.

1345
01:24:29,970 --> 01:24:31,870
So that's crazy.
So this is just something else.

1346
01:24:31,871 --> 01:24:35,890
And that's when I started
what my wife doesn't like,

1347
01:24:36,460 --> 01:24:37,181
the name I give,

1348
01:24:37,181 --> 01:24:42,040
but on Mondays and Thursdays I have what
I call terminal days and terminal days

1349
01:24:42,550 --> 01:24:46,360
are the two days a week in which, um, um,

1350
01:24:46,510 --> 01:24:48,850
my schedule is always completely clear.
I have nothing.

1351
01:24:48,851 --> 01:24:53,851
And I do on those days what I would've
done had I heard this conversation from

1352
01:24:54,461 --> 01:24:58,120
my oncologist. And so I've been
doing this for quite awhile.

1353
01:24:58,390 --> 01:25:01,510
And so my weekends are with the
kids and family and so forth.

1354
01:25:01,511 --> 01:25:06,511
And Mondays and Thursdays I only do what
it is I would do if I had just recently

1355
01:25:07,421 --> 01:25:11,800
learned that I had a terminal
disease and sounds dark.

1356
01:25:11,801 --> 01:25:16,000
But it isn't really because it's just
all about the freedom that you've just

1357
01:25:16,030 --> 01:25:20,800
gained and these days that
you've just gotten back, um,

1358
01:25:20,890 --> 01:25:23,020
to do whatever you want to do,
the way you do it,

1359
01:25:23,021 --> 01:25:25,750
and trying to answer to yourself
what you really want to do.

1360
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:27,650
Because in the beginning you,

1361
01:25:27,651 --> 01:25:30,640
you have these long lists of things
you would do if you had the free time,

1362
01:25:30,641 --> 01:25:31,990
but it's not,
not really true.

1363
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:35,390
So I'd read all these books which
are sitting there and I hadn't read,

1364
01:25:35,391 --> 01:25:37,210
I listened to all this music,
which I hadn't,

1365
01:25:37,540 --> 01:25:41,650
but you do this for an hour or two or
three, but then it gets old as well.

1366
01:25:41,650 --> 01:25:44,260
And there's a reason why you
didn't do enough of it before,

1367
01:25:46,240 --> 01:25:49,570
but it sounds like you'll be able to do
this for hours on end, but you won't.

1368
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:54,220
And so if you're healthy and
you're in good shape and so forth,

1369
01:25:54,221 --> 01:25:56,980
and you have your entire day
ahead of you and nothing to do,

1370
01:25:57,490 --> 01:26:01,390
you start answering very,
very interesting questions about what,

1371
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:04,010
what you really want
and what really moves.

1372
01:26:04,011 --> 01:26:08,270
So it's still going back to answer
your question, the fact is that I've,

1373
01:26:08,710 --> 01:26:09,290
uh,

1374
01:26:09,290 --> 01:26:14,290
I'm not left with goals and I'm left
with a whole set of wonderful processes

1375
01:26:16,761 --> 01:26:19,580
that I love and I'd love
to do again and again,

1376
01:26:20,030 --> 01:26:25,030
but I no longer need or want to
do something that I can measure.

1377
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:29,450
The metrics I think have
gone away. Um, this,

1378
01:26:29,540 --> 01:26:33,740
this process of doing what I want
with the people I love that I'm on,

1379
01:26:33,950 --> 01:26:38,410
that's entirely a process on its own.
It's a goal on its own. And so there,

1380
01:26:38,411 --> 01:26:42,850
there's no longer, I have no wishes for
things that I could buy with money. Uh,

1381
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:45,140
you know,
my kids and my wife are constantly

1382
01:26:47,150 --> 01:26:51,730
frustrated by the fact that
there's nothing that they
can buy me. Um, you know,

1383
01:26:51,740 --> 01:26:54,710
because it's, it's gotten to
that point where, Eh, I don't,

1384
01:26:54,950 --> 01:26:56,960
I don't need it or don't
want it or it doesn't,

1385
01:26:57,080 --> 01:26:58,840
doesn't tickle my fancy and so forth.

1386
01:26:58,841 --> 01:27:03,841
So I'm not left with metrics saying I'd
love to have another this or the money.

1387
01:27:04,251 --> 01:27:07,010
I've,
I've been doing math now I think Tim,

1388
01:27:07,011 --> 01:27:11,960
on my personal finances for
30 something years or more,

1389
01:27:11,961 --> 01:27:14,120
40 years on the same rationale,

1390
01:27:14,121 --> 01:27:19,121
which is how much do I need to have
enabled to lead the life that I do?

1391
01:27:20,700 --> 01:27:25,250
And Swiss bankers used to say that you
need to have 20 times more than you spend

1392
01:27:25,251 --> 01:27:29,410
per year. And it kind of, as
a rule of thumb, that's not
bad, you know, because that,

1393
01:27:29,411 --> 01:27:33,740
that says you need about a 5%
return on my knees. You have.

1394
01:27:33,741 --> 01:27:37,010
So if your lifestyle costs too,
and you say,

1395
01:27:37,011 --> 01:27:42,011
it takes me $5,000 a month to live
minimally the way I want that 60,000.

1396
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:49,120
And so you need the assets in the
value of a million to house plus money,

1397
01:27:49,611 --> 01:27:51,110
whatever.
So,

1398
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:56,560
because I've been always starting from
what it is that I need minimally to have

1399
01:27:56,871 --> 01:28:01,640
fun and to do the many fun things
that you can do with money. Um, uh,

1400
01:28:01,641 --> 01:28:05,240
I just multiply that by
20. If it, if it's over 20,

1401
01:28:05,810 --> 01:28:09,260
I don't worry anymore. And I, I,
thankfully I haven't worked for a while,

1402
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:11,780
but if I looked at the
opportunities that boy,

1403
01:28:11,781 --> 01:28:15,780
if I did this and I put
these two companies together
and that I would have, uh,

1404
01:28:15,950 --> 01:28:16,783
something else.

1405
01:28:17,550 --> 01:28:22,440
If it's going to take away one of my
Mondays or Thursdays are going to take one

1406
01:28:22,441 --> 01:28:25,440
of the Times or many of the times I
can't pick up my kids from school,

1407
01:28:25,460 --> 01:28:29,540
etc. It's certainly a bad deal
no matter how much money or what,

1408
01:28:29,541 --> 01:28:31,230
what metric it is,
you know?

1409
01:28:31,570 --> 01:28:36,100
Definitely. Well, I mean the non
renewable resource being that time,

1410
01:28:36,610 --> 01:28:40,030
and I'd love to hear some details because

1411
01:28:41,690 --> 01:28:45,580
I'm grappling with some of
these issues and structuring.

1412
01:28:46,510 --> 01:28:47,830
Structuring is too formal a word,

1413
01:28:47,831 --> 01:28:51,550
but I had a very good 2016 and I think
it was in part because I had so much

1414
01:28:51,551 --> 01:28:53,420
slack in the system,
uh,

1415
01:28:53,830 --> 01:28:57,670
to do deep work and to enjoy
and savor certain things.

1416
01:28:58,300 --> 01:29:03,300
And 2017 because of the book launch few
months ago or six weeks ago has just

1417
01:29:03,871 --> 01:29:07,740
come crashing in with a lot of
inbound as most of which is noise.

1418
01:29:07,770 --> 01:29:09,300
So I'm thinking a lot about this.

1419
01:29:09,301 --> 01:29:14,301
What are some of the processes that you
love and could you walk us through maybe

1420
01:29:15,091 --> 01:29:19,380
a a Monday or Thursday that
comes to mind and what that,

1421
01:29:19,381 --> 01:29:20,214
what that looks like?

1422
01:29:21,150 --> 01:29:25,640
Yeah, and going from back
to front, um, I've been,

1423
01:29:26,070 --> 01:29:29,230
you know, writing a book in
my head now for the last two,

1424
01:29:29,231 --> 01:29:33,280
three years and I'm just scared of
putting it out there because you are then

1425
01:29:33,281 --> 01:29:38,260
caught in a vortex of your own
making, you know, Andy, right?

1426
01:29:38,261 --> 01:29:40,420
You get a publisher and then you,
you kind of,

1427
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,460
you kind of sell them
the idea that you're,

1428
01:29:43,490 --> 01:29:46,010
you'll be there and they're kind of
saying that I'm going to do this,

1429
01:29:46,011 --> 01:29:50,850
but if I need you for the today show,
you're going to be there. Right? And,

1430
01:29:51,220 --> 01:29:53,080
and you're kind of, yeah, I'll try.

1431
01:29:53,081 --> 01:29:56,360
And so what about the fact
is that didn't really, one,

1432
01:29:56,361 --> 01:30:01,140
you never really want to
take on the whole, uh,

1433
01:30:01,180 --> 01:30:04,780
wait of proving yourself,

1434
01:30:04,781 --> 01:30:09,781
doing your thing and satisfying all
the cosponsors sponsors of your effort.

1435
01:30:10,950 --> 01:30:15,120
Right? And so there's the book launch
and there's right, and there's no end,

1436
01:30:15,121 --> 01:30:15,681
of course,
it,

1437
01:30:15,681 --> 01:30:19,350
it doesn't end that quickly because you
trick yourself into thinking this is six

1438
01:30:19,351 --> 01:30:23,490
months and then it will be okay.
But we know it's not because I just had,

1439
01:30:23,491 --> 01:30:26,270
for example, I got, uh, yesterday,

1440
01:30:26,510 --> 01:30:31,150
I just got my two copies of the,
um,

1441
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:36,280
Chinese edition of my book of, uh, 1993.

1442
01:30:36,281 --> 01:30:40,230
So it takes a little bit.
That happened, right?

1443
01:30:40,810 --> 01:30:42,040
So, you know, I got the,

1444
01:30:42,430 --> 01:30:47,040
the Czech Republic edition of the
seven day weekend, about a month ago.

1445
01:30:47,041 --> 01:30:50,700
So this stuff just had
takes on a life of its own.

1446
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:55,210
And then every time a
request comes for your time,

1447
01:30:56,050 --> 01:30:59,760
you, you stutter, you know,
you say, well, you know,

1448
01:31:00,100 --> 01:31:03,240
I don't really want to take this
slide and go this way and do news.

1449
01:31:03,241 --> 01:31:07,860
But on the other hand, you know, I kind
of have a responsibility to do that.

1450
01:31:08,010 --> 01:31:11,360
And it's, it's a little bit like
the little prince, you know, the,

1451
01:31:11,361 --> 01:31:14,330
the French book by science who could,
is sentenced to spirity,

1452
01:31:14,340 --> 01:31:19,340
which says that you are responsible
for everything that you captivate,

1453
01:31:19,730 --> 01:31:24,030
you know, and so you kind
of feel that, uh, war,

1454
01:31:24,031 --> 01:31:26,720
why did I write the book from first
place if I wrote it in the first place?

1455
01:31:26,721 --> 01:31:30,750
And it means that I should go to the
syndicated radio show because that'll sell

1456
01:31:30,751 --> 01:31:34,260
more books and more people will be
happy and I'll feel better on and on.

1457
01:31:34,470 --> 01:31:38,910
And you're caught with metrics
because somebody will say, so to him,

1458
01:31:38,970 --> 01:31:43,070
how many people listen to your
[inaudible] minion or this,

1459
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:46,590
and I'm number 13 are on
number 11 and under six.

1460
01:31:46,950 --> 01:31:51,480
And people have caught you up in
their vortex of metrics as well.

1461
01:31:51,810 --> 01:31:55,830
And until something happens, you
retire, you die and so forth,

1462
01:31:55,831 --> 01:31:59,680
and it goes away because you're a non
contender from there on and then it's

1463
01:31:59,681 --> 01:32:02,230
perfectly all right.
And then you'll have to think,

1464
01:32:02,231 --> 01:32:06,040
who the hell is going to remember that
20 years from now or 40 years from now?

1465
01:32:06,041 --> 01:32:10,220
And and so, so you're left with the
issue of what am I doing this for? So my,

1466
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:14,770
my answer to all of this, because if you
take this to its ultimate consequence,

1467
01:32:14,771 --> 01:32:16,300
you could easily be in a
situation where you say,

1468
01:32:16,301 --> 01:32:21,301
I do nothing anymore because nothing is
worth it because nothing will reply to

1469
01:32:22,091 --> 01:32:24,730
the issue of metrics.
Nothing will satisfy me enough.

1470
01:32:24,731 --> 01:32:29,731
Nothing is really worth it if we are
these useless specks of dust on the,

1471
01:32:30,100 --> 01:32:31,870
in the universe.
And so I don't,

1472
01:32:31,871 --> 01:32:36,871
I don't take it to that
Russian now because we are
100% of ourselves in terms of

1473
01:32:36,941 --> 01:32:40,480
importance at the same
time. Um, and so you,

1474
01:32:40,481 --> 01:32:45,481
you can be worried about the
state of nations and poverty and,

1475
01:32:45,491 --> 01:32:47,860
uh,
immigration policies.

1476
01:32:47,890 --> 01:32:51,010
But if there's a speck
of dust in your high,

1477
01:32:51,610 --> 01:32:54,460
you're going to spend the next hour
and a half only dealing with that.

1478
01:32:54,461 --> 01:32:57,460
There's nothing else of any importance
in the world while there's a speck in

1479
01:32:57,461 --> 01:32:59,020
your eye and your eyes watery.

1480
01:32:59,470 --> 01:33:03,400
And so what it meant by this is
that on Mondays and Thursdays,

1481
01:33:03,401 --> 01:33:07,460
let's say I stopped the thing, I wake
up and one of the first things I do is,

1482
01:33:07,490 --> 01:33:11,210
is a lounge in bed. Meaning I, uh, I,

1483
01:33:11,230 --> 01:33:15,850
I haven't had an alarm clock I think
for, for 15 or 20 years, but I,

1484
01:33:16,060 --> 01:33:19,960
I say I will not get out of bed.
And of course that doesn't last very long,

1485
01:33:19,961 --> 01:33:22,780
but the feeling is good. And then, um,

1486
01:33:22,781 --> 01:33:26,800
I'm with the kids as a fourth end and
suddenly they get into the van and mine,

1487
01:33:26,820 --> 01:33:30,490
they're, and suddenly
everything is quiet. Um,

1488
01:33:31,180 --> 01:33:35,020
in one second.
And then I start asking myself,

1489
01:33:35,021 --> 01:33:38,170
so what I wanted to do,
I, I could read the paper,

1490
01:33:38,171 --> 01:33:40,870
but I don't really want to read the paper.
And the news is this and that.

1491
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:45,130
I could read that book, but now
I'm halfway there and you're stuck.

1492
01:33:45,131 --> 01:33:50,131
I think many times with the issue that
we keep ourselves busy and we have all of

1493
01:33:50,981 --> 01:33:55,930
these distractions and attractions and
things going at such a rate that when you

1494
01:33:55,931 --> 01:33:59,140
actually turn off all the noise and say,

1495
01:33:59,230 --> 01:34:02,710
which of these things where
I really want to do, um, you,

1496
01:34:02,740 --> 01:34:05,440
you have much more trouble
than you thought you did.

1497
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:10,440
And so when we put that book out there
or as you did and you have requests and

1498
01:34:10,871 --> 01:34:11,890
you have opportunities,

1499
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:17,280
you really just kind of measure the
opportunities of what to do against each

1500
01:34:17,771 --> 01:34:20,620
other. So you know, in
that, in that sense,

1501
01:34:20,890 --> 01:34:24,610
it's a bit like cafca again,
you know, definitely. Um, that,

1502
01:34:25,090 --> 01:34:28,510
that door's open just for you,
but you say, you know, what a,

1503
01:34:28,511 --> 01:34:33,370
is it better to go talk to these guys
in Denver or to do this thing in London?

1504
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:35,890
You know,
but the real question was,

1505
01:34:36,580 --> 01:34:40,840
what the hell for am I doing either of
these? And I think you'll end up with the,

1506
01:34:40,870 --> 01:34:45,870
with the reply that the things
that you can look back on.

1507
01:34:46,001 --> 01:34:48,580
You said that was a good one,
two hours,

1508
01:34:48,581 --> 01:34:53,380
three hours of my life because I either
shared something, I learned something.

1509
01:34:53,700 --> 01:34:58,680
Um, I, it felt good. These are
all wonderful responses. I,

1510
01:34:58,700 --> 01:35:00,920
you know,
or you went to the baseball game,

1511
01:35:00,921 --> 01:35:03,080
you're done losing two hours of your life.

1512
01:35:03,081 --> 01:35:07,280
That's a wonderful way to spend those two
hours if you love baseball and or not.

1513
01:35:07,670 --> 01:35:09,600
And so, um, it,

1514
01:35:09,680 --> 01:35:14,680
it's not about nothingness or undoing
yourself or considering yourself worthless

1515
01:35:15,080 --> 01:35:18,050
and therefore it's not worth
doing anything. Um, and,

1516
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:23,080
but it is especially about not comparing
the opportunities with each other and

1517
01:35:23,901 --> 01:35:26,420
rather compare them. What would
I do if I had the whole day off?

1518
01:35:26,990 --> 01:35:28,790
The best feeling I have in my,

1519
01:35:28,940 --> 01:35:32,630
in my time is never the
Monday and Thursday,

1520
01:35:32,690 --> 01:35:36,770
which I do love when I get up m and bed
thinking today I have nothing to do.

1521
01:35:37,250 --> 01:35:41,780
It is on that Tuesday or on that
Friday when I have something set,

1522
01:35:42,140 --> 01:35:46,130
a conference call or a visit or
something and that gets canceled.

1523
01:35:46,250 --> 01:35:50,900
That's my most wonderful moment is always
when I have stuff to do and somebody

1524
01:35:50,901 --> 01:35:51,441
cancels.

1525
01:35:51,441 --> 01:35:55,220
It has an enormous sense of relief no
matter how important it was or which I was

1526
01:35:55,221 --> 01:35:59,990
looking forward to. It said when somebody
cancels something, I feel elated,

1527
01:35:59,991 --> 01:36:02,840
you know? And so I think that
kind of answers a bit as well. No,

1528
01:36:03,670 --> 01:36:06,070
no it does. And I mean, I'd love to

1529
01:36:08,410 --> 01:36:11,890
uncover some of the,
some of the quirks I had.

1530
01:36:11,891 --> 01:36:15,730
Somebody asked me a question a few days
ago that I thought was a good question.

1531
01:36:15,731 --> 01:36:19,690
We'll find out. It may be, it may
fall flat, but he asked me, what are,

1532
01:36:19,720 --> 01:36:23,980
what are some of absurd things
that you like doing or love doing?

1533
01:36:24,070 --> 01:36:25,750
What are some absurd
things that you love doing?

1534
01:36:26,290 --> 01:36:28,540
Does anything come to mind for you?
When I asked that question,

1535
01:36:28,970 --> 01:36:32,390
um, I have, I have all these old,

1536
01:36:34,040 --> 01:36:38,450
old, old line habits. One of them
comes from Winston Churchill,

1537
01:36:38,451 --> 01:36:43,190
which is to sit in a
bathtub with a lit cigar.

1538
01:36:46,100 --> 01:36:50,790
I'm sure it'll pass a lot of
people's tests of absurdity. But, um,

1539
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:53,270
so sometimes I'll say,
you know,

1540
01:36:53,300 --> 01:36:58,130
now I will do nothing and I
will sit in about for an hour,

1541
01:36:58,130 --> 01:37:02,780
hour and a half with it, with a very long
cigar and sync like Winston Churchill.

1542
01:37:03,050 --> 01:37:07,400
And I always remember this especially
well because Churchill was a guy who was

1543
01:37:07,460 --> 01:37:12,460
even in power and to an extent as happened
to Fdr as well when he had his polio

1544
01:37:12,891 --> 01:37:15,220
thing in Florida.
But I'm,

1545
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:20,440
Winston Churchill would go off a bit
before Christmas and take a ship to Egypt

1546
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:26,270
where he would go to the same
winter palace hotel in sir.

1547
01:37:26,300 --> 01:37:31,300
And he would spend 65 days there a
while he was running the country.

1548
01:37:33,410 --> 01:37:35,780
And so I think we,

1549
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:39,680
we give ourselves an enormous amount
of importance and to our time.

1550
01:37:40,130 --> 01:37:45,130
And I think doing absurd things
interrelated to wasting time,

1551
01:37:45,680 --> 01:37:49,280
I think are a wonderful way to remind
ourselves that we're neither that

1552
01:37:49,281 --> 01:37:50,530
important or that nes,

1553
01:37:50,531 --> 01:37:55,410
her or none of that much happens when
you do absurd things with your time.

1554
01:37:55,460 --> 01:37:58,890
And I think purposely looking
like you're wasting it,

1555
01:37:59,220 --> 01:38:02,190
I think is in an absurdly
wonderful thing to do.

1556
01:38:04,790 --> 01:38:08,780
Do you know, people looking
from the outside in, uh,

1557
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:14,200
many people will be very impressed with
your ability to experiment and to test

1558
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:19,430
and to have failures, but also
have these successes in home runs.

1559
01:38:20,020 --> 01:38:23,960
Do you think about risk differently than
other people or how do you think about

1560
01:38:23,961 --> 01:38:24,794
risk?

1561
01:38:24,860 --> 01:38:28,460
I think that that word is a scary word
to a lot of people and they don't really

1562
01:38:28,461 --> 01:38:32,330
define it for themselves.
Um, and so they don't try,

1563
01:38:32,360 --> 01:38:37,100
but I'd just love to hear your
thoughts on risk or perceiving risk,

1564
01:38:37,101 --> 01:38:37,934
how you think about it.
Yeah.

1565
01:38:38,170 --> 01:38:42,820
When you, when you try and deconstruct
risk, I'd say there, there,

1566
01:38:43,090 --> 01:38:48,050
there's an objective metric
associated with risks.

1567
01:38:48,060 --> 01:38:49,870
So I'm going to start this business.

1568
01:38:49,871 --> 01:38:54,460
I'm going to take 32% of my
savings and I might lose it all.

1569
01:38:54,610 --> 01:38:59,610
So that's a kind of metric that I think
is less scary because you know that it's

1570
01:39:00,511 --> 01:39:03,370
32%, you know, that is, you
lose it, you're going to,

1571
01:39:03,430 --> 01:39:07,150
it's going to be trouble for some
time and then some restrictions, et.

1572
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:12,160
But it is an outside metric which you
are willing to accept. If she'd say,

1573
01:39:12,161 --> 01:39:16,150
I'm going to take a plane and I know that
the statistical risk is zero comments,

1574
01:39:16,151 --> 01:39:18,130
zero,
zero far of this or that,

1575
01:39:18,131 --> 01:39:23,050
or it'd be coming late then and then
a hundred times smaller of the plane

1576
01:39:23,051 --> 01:39:24,730
falling and I'll,
I'll take that risk.

1577
01:39:25,900 --> 01:39:30,010
That bit I think scares people very
little even though they paid bring it up.

1578
01:39:30,340 --> 01:39:35,320
I think people use it very much was an
excuse because the other risk factor is

1579
01:39:35,950 --> 01:39:40,900
how will I look to myself,
to my spouse,

1580
01:39:40,901 --> 01:39:45,370
to my kids too,
my former business partners to micro.

1581
01:39:45,371 --> 01:39:48,610
Now how would I look if the
five flat fall flat on my face?

1582
01:39:48,611 --> 01:39:53,611
And I think that this element of risk
is the one that doesn't bother me almost

1583
01:39:55,661 --> 01:39:59,540
at all because I think it is
so ephemeral. You know, um,

1584
01:39:59,830 --> 01:40:04,050
you get a bad press or
you're getting a bad, uh,

1585
01:40:04,090 --> 01:40:09,090
opinion from neighbors or your wife has
dismayed that you actually did this.

1586
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:13,610
I think all this goes away very
easily and relatively quickly.

1587
01:40:13,620 --> 01:40:15,730
It might take a few months. So she,
here's where all this goes away.

1588
01:40:16,390 --> 01:40:21,390
And it's not to say that it's worth
doing because if you do succeed,

1589
01:40:22,330 --> 01:40:26,050
then you will show them all your
running or rephrase or EOP happier.

1590
01:40:26,140 --> 01:40:30,640
Be gratified yourself even because
we know that a lot of these apparent

1591
01:40:30,641 --> 01:40:35,470
successes and apparent things that we
call home runs, there are also temporary,

1592
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,020
right in that sense that you right,

1593
01:40:38,110 --> 01:40:43,110
you'll do something and the last mile
of everything you do is probably what's

1594
01:40:43,301 --> 01:40:46,360
going to count.
This is also an ironic

1595
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:52,690
turn on life, which is that you go
there and you spend 20, 30 years today.

1596
01:40:52,720 --> 01:40:57,310
This today, today we had one of
our biggest billionaires in Brazil,

1597
01:40:57,700 --> 01:40:59,110
uh,
fall into jail.

1598
01:40:59,770 --> 01:41:03,880
He was in New York over the weekend and
he was arrested and is involved in the

1599
01:41:03,881 --> 01:41:04,691
corruption charge.

1600
01:41:04,691 --> 01:41:09,691
And he was the seventh richest man in
the world who was by far Brazil's a

1601
01:41:11,260 --> 01:41:14,770
richest person, is uh, 20,

1602
01:41:14,771 --> 01:41:19,771
30 years of an earning successes and
one success on top of the other were all

1603
01:41:20,321 --> 01:41:23,680
wonderful. And uh, he obviously
has a genius for business,

1604
01:41:23,681 --> 01:41:27,490
otherwise he wouldn't have gotten where
he got and he has his dark side as well

1605
01:41:27,491 --> 01:41:30,220
and so forth. So he got to this
point, I don't know him personally,

1606
01:41:30,221 --> 01:41:31,054
I've never met him,

1607
01:41:31,210 --> 01:41:35,410
but he got to this point where he was
this billionaire and he had this enormous

1608
01:41:35,411 --> 01:41:39,070
projects and he was doing
wonderful things. And he had a,

1609
01:41:39,100 --> 01:41:42,940
on the side you had hobbies
and restaurants and yachts
and doing things for poor

1610
01:41:42,941 --> 01:41:47,590
people and on and on and on and on. Now
he's in jail. I don't know for how long,

1611
01:41:47,650 --> 01:41:49,120
maybe maybe even not that long,

1612
01:41:49,150 --> 01:41:53,650
but the fact is that he has these hair
products company and was always very

1613
01:41:53,860 --> 01:41:57,490
proud of his hair. And you,
you know another guy who,

1614
01:41:57,780 --> 01:42:01,540
who has similar hair and he in jail,

1615
01:42:01,541 --> 01:42:04,930
the first thing they did was to
shave him bald. So you see now,

1616
01:42:06,510 --> 01:42:10,870
and what I meant to say was, what
is success for this guy? You know,

1617
01:42:11,070 --> 01:42:15,850
it was it the 34 years in which he had
yachts and planes and every president and

1618
01:42:15,851 --> 01:42:19,080
everybody would receive him and you
to wonderful things and so forth.

1619
01:42:19,540 --> 01:42:24,540
Or is it now so tainted by this last
image on his health that he will never

1620
01:42:25,450 --> 01:42:28,480
recover? You know what,
I'm, I'm no judgment at all.

1621
01:42:28,481 --> 01:42:30,960
I'm just saying that when
you think about this,

1622
01:42:30,961 --> 01:42:34,210
who I think about some of the people
who were presidents of Brazil,

1623
01:42:34,211 --> 01:42:38,470
some people who are prisons to the
u s who were there at 50 or 60,

1624
01:42:38,471 --> 01:42:41,680
and their life is over,
it's no longer success.

1625
01:42:41,681 --> 01:42:43,780
It keeps deteriorating as the,

1626
01:42:44,170 --> 01:42:48,940
as the years go by. You know,
you take someone like a,

1627
01:42:49,360 --> 01:42:54,250
like a planted who has an extraordinary
mind, did a lot of good things,

1628
01:42:54,670 --> 01:42:59,670
but they made a few enormous mistakes
with cigars and trainees that you will

1629
01:43:00,341 --> 01:43:04,880
never recover from. And so what,
what is success in that passage?

1630
01:43:04,920 --> 01:43:08,440
I meant what I meant to say was that your
home runs and the businesses you built

1631
01:43:08,441 --> 01:43:10,720
in the menu haven't framed it is all very,

1632
01:43:10,721 --> 01:43:15,721
very fragile and it's probably going to
be measured with how you handle yourself

1633
01:43:16,450 --> 01:43:19,940
in a few very few, uh, uh,

1634
01:43:20,170 --> 01:43:24,010
decisive moments in your life.
And, or in the end, you know,

1635
01:43:24,011 --> 01:43:28,000
the last few things you did are terribly
important compared to what you did

1636
01:43:28,001 --> 01:43:31,720
before. And, uh, or this
guy, I could forget his name.

1637
01:43:31,721 --> 01:43:36,480
Pastorius for pistol Pistorious
in South Africa. Yeah.

1638
01:43:36,490 --> 01:43:37,720
It's tremendous guy,
et cetera.

1639
01:43:37,721 --> 01:43:40,330
Until you kill your girlfriend
and then suddenly the,

1640
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:43,750
all those other successes don't,
don't sit very well.

1641
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:48,670
Now can you do your things,
have your successes, build
up your metrics, et Cetera,

1642
01:43:48,671 --> 01:43:52,240
and then retire and sit tight
for 20, 30 years, enjoying,

1643
01:43:52,290 --> 01:43:57,290
etc. Probably the feeling inside is that
slow your worlds are deteriorating in

1644
01:43:58,461 --> 01:44:00,050
the sense that your friends are dying,

1645
01:44:00,051 --> 01:44:03,800
the press no longer interested in
you and you become, uh, uh, has been,

1646
01:44:03,801 --> 01:44:05,300
who still has a few things to,

1647
01:44:05,690 --> 01:44:10,690
to nail up on the wall or remember
jaded photographs of you with someone.

1648
01:44:12,141 --> 01:44:13,730
Very important,
you know?

1649
01:44:13,970 --> 01:44:18,970
And so I think that the success factor
and this metric of how you measure

1650
01:44:21,021 --> 01:44:24,020
yourself is very,
very fragile.

1651
01:44:24,380 --> 01:44:29,050
And when we stick to it, we stick to
something that, uh, won't be there.

1652
01:44:29,170 --> 01:44:32,620
When we try to hold it in our hands,
it has to be held a bit like a bird,

1653
01:44:32,621 --> 01:44:34,810
you know, as you press it a
little bit too hard at that.

1654
01:44:35,810 --> 01:44:40,810
How do you think of success for
yourself then in place of leaning on or

1655
01:44:43,161 --> 01:44:47,630
depending on the Ephemera and all of
these things that can be taken away so

1656
01:44:47,631 --> 01:44:52,490
easily, uh, or destroyed
so easily. How do you,

1657
01:44:53,240 --> 01:44:58,100
how do you feel at peace with yourself
or feel successful? What, what,

1658
01:44:58,250 --> 01:44:59,900
how do you,
what Lens do you use for that?

1659
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:00,891
I try to,

1660
01:45:00,891 --> 01:45:05,891
I try to exchange these lenses of past
and future for living in the present,

1661
01:45:06,051 --> 01:45:10,100
which is the only very difficult
thing to do. We talk about it,

1662
01:45:10,101 --> 01:45:14,010
but nobody knows how to
do it. MMM. You know,

1663
01:45:14,011 --> 01:45:16,500
the James Taylor is set in
a song because that, uh,

1664
01:45:16,930 --> 01:45:20,910
the meaning of life is to enjoy the
passing of time and try their best at the

1665
01:45:20,911 --> 01:45:24,920
time is by far the hardest
thing we can ever do in.

1666
01:45:24,950 --> 01:45:26,240
We take your thought process.

1667
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:31,480
We are almost constantly living
in the past or in the future.

1668
01:45:31,700 --> 01:45:36,700
And so success to me is always making
sure that this passing of time is

1669
01:45:38,041 --> 01:45:39,360
worthwhile.
That's his past.

1670
01:45:39,361 --> 01:45:42,740
He knew his time right now that I'm not
exchanging it for a hole in the future.

1671
01:45:42,770 --> 01:45:45,300
I'm not exchanging for um,

1672
01:45:45,330 --> 01:45:50,330
something I got or had in the past and
that you're always kind of ready two

1673
01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:54,890
survivor to withstand

1674
01:45:55,570 --> 01:46:00,090
through the use of this wisdom
of, of present time, of which I'm,

1675
01:46:00,310 --> 01:46:04,690
I'm very far still from it, but I just
keep hammering it into my own head.

1676
01:46:05,110 --> 01:46:07,830
This passing of time, if this, uh,

1677
01:46:08,310 --> 01:46:13,310
podcast and conversation with you was
worth it because it made me think because

1678
01:46:13,921 --> 01:46:17,280
it was saw tool for a sense so far,
um,

1679
01:46:17,440 --> 01:46:21,300
that that is success and that can
never be taken away no matter what.

1680
01:46:21,360 --> 01:46:24,150
Tomorrow I don't have the money or I
don't have this sort of things go wrong,

1681
01:46:24,900 --> 01:46:27,490
God forbid, uh, with, with people. Uh,

1682
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:30,460
the fact is that that
one hour or two hours,

1683
01:46:30,461 --> 01:46:35,110
which was spent in the broadcast thinking
about licensing and exchanging that,

1684
01:46:35,111 --> 01:46:38,740
that one was definitely worthwhile and
successful and no one can no longer be

1685
01:46:38,741 --> 01:46:43,720
taken away from you because it's not
part and when it becomes part of your

1686
01:46:43,721 --> 01:46:48,340
history or your past is just building
blocks of time that were spent.

1687
01:46:48,550 --> 01:46:51,810
You know, I had an interesting
situation with for a time I was,

1688
01:46:52,020 --> 01:46:56,070
I was buying much more wine than I
should have because I was kind of,

1689
01:46:56,100 --> 01:46:59,760
I got into the collector's mode about 25,
30 years ago.

1690
01:47:00,670 --> 01:47:04,290
And so I kept buying at auctions
and of course you get into this,

1691
01:47:05,200 --> 01:47:08,130
uh,
thing where you need to have,

1692
01:47:08,131 --> 01:47:11,970
have that 1959 or otherwise and so forth.

1693
01:47:11,971 --> 01:47:16,260
And so you'll go crazy at auction,
you overpay and so forth. And uh,

1694
01:47:16,290 --> 01:47:19,850
and one of these days I, Hey,
I had a friend over and I,

1695
01:47:20,220 --> 01:47:23,490
I opened one of these wonderful
wines that were extraordinary,

1696
01:47:23,491 --> 01:47:26,870
extraordinary year and I,
I'll be at Ford and so forth.

1697
01:47:27,320 --> 01:47:30,470
And this stuff can't be used for
vinegar was completely spoiled.

1698
01:47:30,471 --> 01:47:32,660
It was always completely
spot when I bought it.

1699
01:47:32,780 --> 01:47:34,940
It was is already worth
nothing whatsoever.

1700
01:47:35,810 --> 01:47:38,220
And I always thought it was an
interesting collection because you,

1701
01:47:38,630 --> 01:47:43,630
you buy all of this wine that you have
all kinds of expectations from and you're

1702
01:47:44,210 --> 01:47:45,260
learning to say,
you know,

1703
01:47:45,261 --> 01:47:50,261
this has pencil shavings and a bit of
mineral that and some marigolds flower in

1704
01:47:50,811 --> 01:47:53,030
the taste and so far.
But you know,

1705
01:47:53,031 --> 01:47:56,360
there's an enormous amount of bullshit
in what you're doing and why you're doing

1706
01:47:56,361 --> 01:47:57,194
it and so forth.

1707
01:47:57,650 --> 01:48:02,390
But the interesting part is that once
you consume your collectible by drinking

1708
01:48:02,391 --> 01:48:07,180
the wine, you're left always
with 20 cents of glass, which is,

1709
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:14,480
and so it's just a way of saying
that this whole process of,

1710
01:48:14,481 --> 01:48:18,650
of wine is it good is a
good comparison because, um,

1711
01:48:19,250 --> 01:48:22,270
one guy told me a few Kitsune what,
what,

1712
01:48:22,340 --> 01:48:24,440
what gets you into your,

1713
01:48:24,930 --> 01:48:28,610
your seller and makes you
take a bottle of wine,

1714
01:48:28,611 --> 01:48:33,611
which you paid $100 for is now worth
$1,000 and drink this and be left with a

1715
01:48:33,801 --> 01:48:38,150
little bit of glass because you end up
probably not even having the courage to

1716
01:48:38,151 --> 01:48:42,620
drink this wine that now is so,
uh, valuable, et Cetera, et cetera.

1717
01:48:42,621 --> 01:48:45,830
But I, I've always answered
that in the following way.

1718
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:52,000
If one day I look at my seller and I do
now and it's about half empty or more,

1719
01:48:52,330 --> 01:48:53,990
it is now about half empty.

1720
01:48:54,440 --> 01:48:57,530
And I think that every time I
pulled one of those bottles,

1721
01:48:57,531 --> 01:49:01,700
it was because I was with friends
or because I was feeling good over.

1722
01:49:01,701 --> 01:49:04,190
This was a great time.
This must've been a good life.

1723
01:49:04,280 --> 01:49:07,640
Looking at those empty holes,
you know? And so that's,

1724
01:49:07,641 --> 01:49:08,960
I think with everything else,
if,

1725
01:49:09,110 --> 01:49:12,110
if you're using that time and you
at the end of it, you say, boy,

1726
01:49:12,111 --> 01:49:15,910
that was a good two hours of this
was worth it, then success is,

1727
01:49:15,940 --> 01:49:17,180
is certainly guaranteed.

1728
01:49:17,490 --> 01:49:20,930
How did you stop,
uh,

1729
01:49:21,150 --> 01:49:26,150
the collection of wine when you were
getting caught up in these auctions and so

1730
01:49:26,311 --> 01:49:31,040
on? What was the pattern
interrupt or the, the,

1731
01:49:31,220 --> 01:49:36,210
the conversation or the moment when
you decided to, to stop doing that?

1732
01:49:37,460 --> 01:49:40,290
I actually remember it very well.
It was very specific.

1733
01:49:40,310 --> 01:49:45,170
I went to Thailand and,
um, and in Thailand I met,

1734
01:49:45,171 --> 01:49:46,700
this guy was actually Chinese,

1735
01:49:46,701 --> 01:49:51,340
but he was in Thailand and he was a
tomato farmer and he had a mini mills.

1736
01:49:51,341 --> 01:49:56,290
He had these many steel mills, steel
mills, and he was a magnet and he'd made,

1737
01:49:56,291 --> 01:49:59,880
it was a real tycoon. He'd made
enormous amounts of money is set aside.

1738
01:50:00,060 --> 01:50:03,790
And we were, we went to have
dinner with this guy and, um,

1739
01:50:04,120 --> 01:50:08,500
he was smoking all through the
dinner. And I asked him, you know,

1740
01:50:08,501 --> 01:50:12,370
how many cigarettes? He smokes
a day or packs. And he said, no,

1741
01:50:12,371 --> 01:50:13,600
I light one in bed.

1742
01:50:14,140 --> 01:50:18,100
And then I lied all the
cigarettes with another cigarette.

1743
01:50:18,950 --> 01:50:22,480
That's why I never did. I never did the
math on that, but it can't be very good.

1744
01:50:22,630 --> 01:50:24,010
But anyway,
so he would,

1745
01:50:24,040 --> 01:50:27,240
he would eat with one hand and he would
puff with the other and at no moment to

1746
01:50:27,241 --> 01:50:30,600
do stop smoking. And, um,

1747
01:50:30,730 --> 01:50:32,320
then we started talking about,

1748
01:50:32,321 --> 01:50:35,970
he said that he's has a bit of an
obsession for things and so forth.

1749
01:50:35,971 --> 01:50:39,430
The city collects things. I said,
what do you collect? And he said,

1750
01:50:39,431 --> 01:50:41,260
I collect Mercedes cars.

1751
01:50:42,810 --> 01:50:46,300
And so you have a lot of these. And
he said, yeah, I have a lot of these.

1752
01:50:46,301 --> 01:50:51,070
I have 111 warehouses,
Mercedes.

1753
01:50:51,640 --> 01:50:52,240
And he said,

1754
01:50:52,240 --> 01:50:56,830
and I have the mercy of
the first Mercedes of 1896,

1755
01:50:56,831 --> 01:50:58,780
which is a steam Mercedes.

1756
01:50:59,590 --> 01:51:03,070
And I have all the Mercedes in
between. And I said, what do you mean?

1757
01:51:03,520 --> 01:51:07,840
Every time there is a Mercedes that
comes out every year they come out with

1758
01:51:07,841 --> 01:51:09,910
let's say six models that buy one of each.

1759
01:51:10,840 --> 01:51:13,860
And when Mercedes needed,
uh,

1760
01:51:14,190 --> 01:51:17,350
Himmler's car and the car
that Hitler went into Paris,

1761
01:51:17,610 --> 01:51:21,580
I lent them the car because I have
the car. Okay. And so I was there,

1762
01:51:21,581 --> 01:51:25,540
obviously stunned at this conversation
and all this smoking and I was like,

1763
01:51:25,541 --> 01:51:25,961
Jesus,

1764
01:51:25,961 --> 01:51:29,950
what a little do I know about interesting
people are free to people around the

1765
01:51:29,951 --> 01:51:34,220
world. And then I, uh, at one
point I said, well, but uh,

1766
01:51:34,300 --> 01:51:37,980
so what do you, you just keep on
collecting? He says that instead of,

1767
01:51:37,981 --> 01:51:39,340
then of course I have to go,

1768
01:51:39,341 --> 01:51:43,780
I have to go in a few days I'm going
to an auction because there are several

1769
01:51:43,781 --> 01:51:47,380
Mercedes there, there were a total
of 12 Mercedes, which I don't have.

1770
01:51:48,460 --> 01:51:50,740
And I said to him, now, how much
does it bother? Instead of, Oh,

1771
01:51:50,741 --> 01:51:53,480
I keeps me awake many nights he said,

1772
01:51:53,481 --> 01:51:56,130
and I keep going at it and
I'm going crazy and I work at,

1773
01:51:56,140 --> 01:51:59,230
I need to have these talk more sense. And
at that moment I stopped buying anyone.

1774
01:51:59,240 --> 01:51:59,700
Yeah.

1775
01:51:59,700 --> 01:52:02,040
I don't think I brought a wife since.

1776
01:52:05,180 --> 01:52:10,080
My God, what a story. Uh, we, we
could go for a very long time.

1777
01:52:10,081 --> 01:52:11,760
I want to be respectful of your time.

1778
01:52:11,761 --> 01:52:16,761
There's so many things that I'd
love to touch on like Lumiar and,

1779
01:52:16,981 --> 01:52:20,520
and many other areas.
But tell me what you think of this.

1780
01:52:20,521 --> 01:52:25,521
We could do a few rapid fire questions
and then maybe if you enjoyed this and

1781
01:52:26,341 --> 01:52:28,800
everyone enjoys it, which I think they
will, we could consider maybe doing,

1782
01:52:29,250 --> 01:52:30,810
I'll follow up at some point.
Uh,

1783
01:52:30,811 --> 01:52:33,920
I'm certainly happy to stay on and talk
about anything you'd like, but I'd,

1784
01:52:34,170 --> 01:52:39,170
I'd love to ask maybe a few rapid fire
questions and then lead people to what

1785
01:52:39,331 --> 01:52:41,580
you're up to now and where they can,
they can find you if that,

1786
01:52:41,610 --> 01:52:42,690
if that sounds like a plan,

1787
01:52:42,691 --> 01:52:45,980
but I know we've been on for
recording now close two hours. So

1788
01:52:45,980 --> 01:52:49,490
if, if, if that works for you, we
could, we could take that approach,

1789
01:52:49,491 --> 01:52:52,610
but I'm certainly happy to touch on
anything that you'd like to talk about.

1790
01:52:53,500 --> 01:52:58,130
No, let's do that. And
you're, I'm assuming you want
rapid fire applies as well,

1791
01:52:58,140 --> 01:52:58,973
which is not my

1792
01:52:58,980 --> 01:52:59,791
special,
no,

1793
01:52:59,791 --> 01:53:04,110
the rapid fire questions really just
means that I have to stop asking multipart

1794
01:53:04,350 --> 01:53:08,790
questions with 17 commas.
So your answer can be as,

1795
01:53:08,791 --> 01:53:13,530
as long as you'd like.
So I will just keep my questions short.

1796
01:53:13,900 --> 01:53:18,530
Uh, and I'm certainly not
in any rush. Uh, this, uh,

1797
01:53:18,870 --> 01:53:23,870
number one is what books have
you re-read the most yourself?

1798
01:53:24,740 --> 01:53:29,390
Oh, very. Always go
back to, um, two books,

1799
01:53:29,391 --> 01:53:32,030
one by Carl Young and,

1800
01:53:32,060 --> 01:53:37,060
and this whole issue of
collective unconscious,

1801
01:53:37,430 --> 01:53:42,430
which is to me a big issue because you
either are able to touch in and touch and

1802
01:53:43,281 --> 01:53:47,120
get involved somehow in this collective
unconscious or you're doing things which

1803
01:53:47,121 --> 01:53:49,450
are very much on your own and,

1804
01:53:49,510 --> 01:53:54,000
and not significant in a sense that
they're trailblazing, et cetera.

1805
01:53:54,300 --> 01:53:58,970
They're, they're just not connected
to the world as they should be.

1806
01:53:59,300 --> 01:54:00,680
And another one I keep,

1807
01:54:00,740 --> 01:54:05,450
I keep going back to is very interesting
because I come from a Jewish family,

1808
01:54:05,451 --> 01:54:08,400
even though nobody was,
was religious. There's a,

1809
01:54:08,510 --> 01:54:11,900
there's a cultural unethical issue there,
but I only found out actually I was

1810
01:54:13,400 --> 01:54:18,080
maybe 10 years ago and, um, uh,
even though I have suspicious of it,

1811
01:54:18,170 --> 01:54:21,770
but the one that I read every once in a
while I pick up because it's around the

1812
01:54:21,771 --> 01:54:24,920
house. And because my wife has a
bit more religious is, is the Bible,

1813
01:54:24,921 --> 01:54:29,921
but it was a wonderful set of stories,

1814
01:54:29,961 --> 01:54:33,440
philosophy, et cetera. And I read it
much like you would read Shakespeare,

1815
01:54:33,441 --> 01:54:35,960
you know, and it's just extraordinary
because it has everything.

1816
01:54:35,961 --> 01:54:39,260
Shakespeare has all of the human traits.
If you look somewhere,

1817
01:54:39,261 --> 01:54:43,490
you will find it either in King Lear and
have litter and buck methods there. And,

1818
01:54:43,491 --> 01:54:44,530
uh,
and the,

1819
01:54:44,531 --> 01:54:48,920
the vibe was very interesting
book to keep going back to,

1820
01:54:49,400 --> 01:54:52,400
to,
to get a glimpse of humanity.

1821
01:54:53,620 --> 01:54:56,200
Do you have any favorite
documentaries or movies?

1822
01:54:58,370 --> 01:55:01,490
Yeah, my favorite documentary is
one called up. Are you seeing that?

1823
01:55:01,590 --> 01:55:03,810
I have, yes. It's fantastic.

1824
01:55:04,950 --> 01:55:07,990
And, uh, and for, for the
people listening to us, it's,

1825
01:55:08,050 --> 01:55:13,050
it's a Guy Michael apted who were in
1964 decided to follow about a dozen,

1826
01:55:15,571 --> 01:55:20,571
actually more kids from very different
backgrounds and from in the UK and some

1827
01:55:23,521 --> 01:55:28,521
in orphanages and some very well off to
try and establish how much people are

1828
01:55:29,640 --> 01:55:32,880
stuck to their,
um,

1829
01:55:33,840 --> 01:55:36,090
to their context,
to their social context.

1830
01:55:36,091 --> 01:55:38,700
And so when it's very interesting because
he follows them every seven years,

1831
01:55:38,701 --> 01:55:43,560
right? So it's seven, 14, 2128 and
so forth until 56, which was the one.

1832
01:55:44,190 --> 01:55:47,730
And it's quite an extraordinary
way to look at humanity and see,

1833
01:55:47,970 --> 01:55:52,740
can people really escape their
social constraints and their initial,

1834
01:55:53,160 --> 01:55:56,180
um, lay of life, you know,

1835
01:55:56,340 --> 01:56:01,340
and in general is the assumption is that
they cannot and that great sense that

1836
01:56:01,620 --> 01:56:05,160
bares itself out. Note Tim in the sense
that it doesn't look like you can,

1837
01:56:05,580 --> 01:56:09,400
you can stray that far from
the path on average. No.

1838
01:56:10,360 --> 01:56:12,490
Yeah, it's, I think they
revisited them what,

1839
01:56:12,491 --> 01:56:16,390
every five years or something like that.
Seven, seven I'm sorry. That's right.

1840
01:56:16,391 --> 01:56:21,050
Because it was seven up and then it
became the seven up series. Uh, yeah,

1841
01:56:21,200 --> 01:56:25,080
all multiples of seven. But it's the
same people, which is extraordinary.

1842
01:56:25,081 --> 01:56:29,190
You seen someone who's seven was
14, it was 21 was 28. It was not 56.

1843
01:56:29,730 --> 01:56:33,780
And their dreams and their hopes and what
they were actually able to do and how

1844
01:56:33,781 --> 01:56:36,870
close they in these seven year periods,

1845
01:56:37,110 --> 01:56:41,210
how close they have stayed too.

1846
01:56:41,360 --> 01:56:46,080
They're calling a parent calling
in life before they were born.

1847
01:56:46,170 --> 01:56:47,490
It's an incredible situation.

1848
01:56:47,610 --> 01:56:52,260
Yeah, it's a, this is, this
is the documentary series.

1849
01:56:52,261 --> 01:56:54,550
It's come up three or three or four times.
Uh,

1850
01:56:54,570 --> 01:56:58,860
I'd never heard of it before interviewing
a number of people on the podcast.

1851
01:56:58,861 --> 01:57:02,490
So that was actually introduced to the
series through the podcast as well.

1852
01:57:02,580 --> 01:57:07,370
It's wonderful. And, uh, just just
on that tone tend to say that,

1853
01:57:07,670 --> 01:57:11,480
you know, you're, you're in a country
that says, boy, anybody can do anything.

1854
01:57:11,481 --> 01:57:14,780
You May, anybody can be anything. Don't
let anybody stand in your way. You can be,

1855
01:57:14,781 --> 01:57:18,410
et cetera. But it's not really
true at all. This is I think,

1856
01:57:18,411 --> 01:57:23,330
a very interesting take on this
documentary and on the American dream,

1857
01:57:23,331 --> 01:57:27,950
you know, even what's what's happening
today in the u s has a reaction to this.

1858
01:57:27,951 --> 01:57:31,580
So where the fuck is my American dream
that was promised to me, you know,

1859
01:57:31,970 --> 01:57:36,610
but the fact is that you're promising
classroom of kids and as a valid the

1860
01:57:36,611 --> 01:57:39,990
Taurian and speaking
at conferences and uh,

1861
01:57:40,170 --> 01:57:44,870
egging them on at Mbas,
the fact is that you cannot,

1862
01:57:45,200 --> 01:57:48,380
you know, humanity has a programmer
and long story in a very,

1863
01:57:48,381 --> 01:57:53,300
very long proof that I'm in general,

1864
01:57:53,660 --> 01:57:58,190
your chance of changing walks of life,
changing class,

1865
01:57:58,191 --> 01:58:00,740
changing path from what,

1866
01:58:00,800 --> 01:58:05,730
for the context which you were started
with is a very, very rare situation.

1867
01:58:05,730 --> 01:58:06,471
And that very,

1868
01:58:06,471 --> 01:58:10,940
very rare situation makes for
wonderful books and speeches and films.

1869
01:58:11,270 --> 01:58:14,010
But it only makes for these wonderful,
uh,

1870
01:58:14,450 --> 01:58:18,470
for this wonderful entertainment
because it's so, so rarely true.

1871
01:58:18,680 --> 01:58:22,550
Now is that very dismal and disappointing
to look at and say, boy, you know,

1872
01:58:22,700 --> 01:58:26,300
now that you've put this in my face
now I'm not going to try anything.

1873
01:58:26,301 --> 01:58:27,980
It's not even worth it.
No,

1874
01:58:27,981 --> 01:58:32,981
it's just to remember that in the passing
of time of the station of life that

1875
01:58:33,771 --> 01:58:34,190
was,

1876
01:58:34,190 --> 01:58:38,880
that was created or available to you and
your context there could be and should

1877
01:58:38,881 --> 01:58:39,950
be a wonderful life.

1878
01:58:39,951 --> 01:58:44,860
The wonderful life is in rising all
the time until you're at the top.

1879
01:58:44,861 --> 01:58:47,990
There's nothing that's particularly
interesting at the top.

1880
01:58:47,991 --> 01:58:51,010
It just seems absolutely wonderful.
When you're looking at it from the bottom,

1881
01:58:51,560 --> 01:58:54,710
what would you say, for instance,
if you were teaching again,

1882
01:58:54,860 --> 01:58:59,030
but instead of at the MBA program at Mit,

1883
01:58:59,060 --> 01:59:04,060
you were teaching a ninth grade class
in some economically disadvantaged area,

1884
01:59:06,920 --> 01:59:11,060
let's just say,
could be the ghetto in Chicago,

1885
01:59:11,061 --> 01:59:16,061
could be any number of places in the u s
w what would you teach in that ninth or

1886
01:59:17,331 --> 01:59:22,331
10th grade class to help them improve the
odds of not remaining in their current

1887
01:59:23,271 --> 01:59:24,104
cycle?

1888
01:59:25,980 --> 01:59:29,710
And I have, you know, we obviously you,

1889
01:59:29,890 --> 01:59:33,100
you talk way too much, so we haven't
had time to talk about education,

1890
01:59:33,101 --> 01:59:37,840
which I'd love to as
well. But of course, I've,

1891
01:59:37,900 --> 01:59:41,020
I've taken, let's say
the last 10, 12 years,

1892
01:59:41,021 --> 01:59:45,970
I've taken all of this effort and this
risk taking what I learned before and

1893
01:59:45,971 --> 01:59:50,620
taking it to the world of
education. And, but, uh, I spent,

1894
01:59:50,860 --> 01:59:52,180
uh,
the first,

1895
01:59:52,181 --> 01:59:57,181
the first few years of that teaching
six year olds in a public school and

1896
01:59:58,090 --> 02:00:02,050
heavily just disadvantaged bandage kids
and so forth. So it was, it was fun to do.

1897
02:00:02,610 --> 02:00:07,360
Um, what I, what I tried to
do most with them was to,

1898
02:00:07,750 --> 02:00:08,583
um,

1899
02:00:09,700 --> 02:00:14,700
get them to realize the magic of the
accumulated wisdom of human kind.

1900
02:00:16,211 --> 02:00:20,740
And that poking at this magic of
what we've been able to do and think,

1901
02:00:20,741 --> 02:00:23,860
and all this time,
all the rest will take care of itself.

1902
02:00:23,860 --> 02:00:26,560
And so if I sit there and say,
you can do this,

1903
02:00:26,561 --> 02:00:30,910
you can find the strength within you.
It is possible.

1904
02:00:30,911 --> 02:00:33,250
You can do anything you want. You
can be anything you want. I don't,

1905
02:00:33,310 --> 02:00:37,120
I don't believe in that. And so I kept
showing them things like I would say,

1906
02:00:37,121 --> 02:00:40,150
I remember one day it was stepping
outside of there. I said, let's,

1907
02:00:40,630 --> 02:00:45,630
I'm going to teach you the special
relativity theory of Einstein.

1908
02:00:47,080 --> 02:00:50,550
So it's like you're here with me
in this little village, right?

1909
02:00:50,580 --> 02:00:55,240
Right now you look up and I say, how
long would it take you to go to the moon?

1910
02:00:55,360 --> 02:00:58,840
And so they'd say this and
that and rockets and all
what it was and promoted to

1911
02:00:58,841 --> 02:01:02,230
the next and on and on and
to Neptune and ranch. Great.

1912
02:01:02,231 --> 02:01:05,780
And then to the edge of the universe.
And then there's the, their,

1913
02:01:05,800 --> 02:01:07,990
their mind is going all
over the place of course.

1914
02:01:07,990 --> 02:01:09,820
And we're trying to think this
through together. And I said,

1915
02:01:09,850 --> 02:01:11,650
if you come to the end of the world,

1916
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:16,470
the end of the universe and there were
a little quicker and now you've traveled

1917
02:01:16,980 --> 02:01:20,760
for thousands and thousands and thousands
of years in your rocket ship and so

1918
02:01:20,761 --> 02:01:24,750
forth. And now according
to this man, Mr Einstein,

1919
02:01:24,751 --> 02:01:27,640
you opened this little curtain
at the end of the universe.

1920
02:01:27,660 --> 02:01:32,150
Where would you be the answer?
[inaudible] in,

1921
02:01:32,320 --> 02:01:34,990
in following the theory. And people
will know, this will tell you,

1922
02:01:35,290 --> 02:01:38,240
you will be in this
little village right here.

1923
02:01:38,600 --> 02:01:41,990
Well was looking up into
the sky and these crazy,

1924
02:01:41,991 --> 02:01:46,200
crazy concepts which are true and
which are about us. And to say that he,

1925
02:01:46,201 --> 02:01:47,450
we are up here in the mountains,

1926
02:01:47,451 --> 02:01:52,451
so time here moves a little quicker than
it does at beach level and so that you

1927
02:01:54,261 --> 02:01:57,290
have exact twins who were
born and one is on the beach.

1928
02:01:57,291 --> 02:02:00,950
One is an amount by the end of
90 years when they meet again,

1929
02:02:01,180 --> 02:02:04,590
the one in the mountain will be older,
slightly older.

1930
02:02:05,130 --> 02:02:06,660
This kind of stuff is to me,

1931
02:02:06,690 --> 02:02:10,970
what unlocks the whole possibility
for people to think, boy,

1932
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:12,700
I can be anything,
do anything.

1933
02:02:12,701 --> 02:02:17,440
It's harder because they're looking at
the magical response of what life looks

1934
02:02:17,441 --> 02:02:19,810
like,
what we've learned all along to this date,

1935
02:02:20,230 --> 02:02:24,160
and that is the key that
they can eventually use to
free themselves. Or is it,

1936
02:02:28,040 --> 02:02:32,370
if you could have a gigantic billboard
anywhere and actually now I think a

1937
02:02:32,380 --> 02:02:35,000
billboards are there.
No billboards in Sao Paulo.

1938
02:02:35,360 --> 02:02:39,170
I feel like that's one of a few cities
that has perhaps made the billboards

1939
02:02:39,740 --> 02:02:43,410
illegal. But that's, that's an aside. The,
the, the metaphorical question is if you,

1940
02:02:43,411 --> 02:02:47,150
if you could have one gigantic
billboard anywhere with anything on it,

1941
02:02:47,240 --> 02:02:49,760
in other words, just getting a short
message out to millions of people,

1942
02:02:49,790 --> 02:02:51,230
what would you put on that billboard?

1943
02:02:52,970 --> 02:02:55,720
No,
that's enough.

1944
02:02:57,570 --> 02:03:02,520
People pay attention to, to
now so many other issues, uh,

1945
02:03:02,610 --> 02:03:07,610
go away because I think so
much of everything we do
is taken up by the past and

1946
02:03:07,951 --> 02:03:11,690
the future.
And so little of our successes there that

1947
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:12,960
remembering,

1948
02:03:13,440 --> 02:03:16,800
uh, that you're now in a bus, you're not
on a train, you're not going somewhere,

1949
02:03:16,801 --> 02:03:17,640
you don't want,
you're not,

1950
02:03:17,700 --> 02:03:22,700
this is the stuff that I think falls short
all the time and somehow it does have

1951
02:03:23,401 --> 02:03:24,780
a lot of restrictions on,

1952
02:03:25,380 --> 02:03:29,720
on billboards and it's expensive and
it takes authorizations and Soho.

1953
02:03:29,850 --> 02:03:31,780
So that helps.
But some of us,

1954
02:03:31,790 --> 02:03:36,790
so many other visual problems now we
have a new Trump like mayor who is going

1955
02:03:37,741 --> 02:03:39,380
around and uh,

1956
02:03:39,690 --> 02:03:43,710
covering up all of the spray
paints of the was graffiti artists.

1957
02:03:43,711 --> 02:03:44,544
That's the newest,

1958
02:03:46,090 --> 02:03:50,620
well, I think this is a
good place to, to wrap up.

1959
02:03:50,710 --> 02:03:52,180
And do you have any,

1960
02:03:52,350 --> 02:03:55,570
and I'll ask you where people can find
more about you and certainly put that in

1961
02:03:55,571 --> 02:03:59,620
the show notes as well, but do you have
any ask or request for my audience,

1962
02:03:59,621 --> 02:04:03,640
the people listening, any or any last
parting words that you'd like to share?

1963
02:04:03,830 --> 02:04:08,320
Yeah, I'd say that, you know, again, when
I think about, you know, why, why would I,

1964
02:04:09,030 --> 02:04:12,970
uh,
sit with you and a to our podcast,

1965
02:04:12,971 --> 02:04:17,971
why would I have a few people that I
wanted to talk to and that during this

1966
02:04:17,981 --> 02:04:22,060
little podcast episode of my own,
um,

1967
02:04:22,380 --> 02:04:26,470
it's all to do with, and
essentially of course, it's all a,

1968
02:04:26,471 --> 02:04:30,070
is it songful,
is it insightful for myself?

1969
02:04:30,071 --> 02:04:34,900
And therefore it's always very self
serving and very and very narrow,

1970
02:04:34,901 --> 02:04:37,470
let's say. But on the other hand, my,

1971
02:04:37,710 --> 02:04:42,660
my very generic wishes always a people
will be able to take a little something

1972
02:04:42,661 --> 02:04:45,810
out of it, which has an insight into
something that was already there.

1973
02:04:45,840 --> 02:04:47,790
Not that we created in this conversation,

1974
02:04:47,791 --> 02:04:52,791
but to someone takes on a little act of
courage in either giving more freedom to

1975
02:04:54,361 --> 02:04:58,170
people who were with them or
for them or their kids or their,

1976
02:04:58,500 --> 02:04:59,700
anything that's around.

1977
02:04:59,940 --> 02:05:04,530
And I think that it's terribly gratifying
to do just these very small leaps of

1978
02:05:04,531 --> 02:05:09,531
faith in these very small movements in
the direction of what seems like risk

1979
02:05:10,710 --> 02:05:14,400
and, uh, and is never a risk
because it's never a metric issue.

1980
02:05:14,401 --> 02:05:19,401
It's just getting past your own misgivings
about doing something new and that

1981
02:05:21,570 --> 02:05:26,310
that would be my hope that people take
this little leap of fancy or leap of

1982
02:05:26,311 --> 02:05:31,311
faith and finally decide to
make a change on constraints,

1983
02:05:31,651 --> 02:05:36,420
on restrictions that they either have or
that they need to fight against or they

1984
02:05:36,421 --> 02:05:40,950
need to remove other people from and
find that that's a hell of a lot more

1985
02:05:41,100 --> 02:05:42,510
liberating than it sounds

1986
02:05:43,490 --> 02:05:46,850
car do. I really appreciate you taking
the time. This was extremely fun for me.

1987
02:05:47,540 --> 02:05:49,670
And, uh, I've,

1988
02:05:49,700 --> 02:05:53,300
I've known you only through
video and texts up to this point.

1989
02:05:53,301 --> 02:05:56,960
So this was a unique opportunity for me.
So number one.

Hey guys, this is Tim again.

1998
02:06:31,941 --> 02:06:35,120
Just a few more things before
you take off. Number one,

1999
02:06:35,330 --> 02:06:37,040
this is five bullet Friday.

2000
02:06:37,340 --> 02:06:40,340
Do you want to get a short email from me?

2001
02:06:40,341 --> 02:06:42,950
Would you enjoy getting a short
email from me every Friday?

2002
02:06:43,220 --> 02:06:47,450
That provides a little more soul of
fun before the weekend and five bullet

2003
02:06:47,451 --> 02:06:52,100
Friday is a very short email where I share
the coolest things I've found or that

2004
02:06:52,101 --> 02:06:53,690
I've been pondering over the week.

2005
02:06:53,900 --> 02:06:56,660
That could include favorite new
albums that I've discovered.

2006
02:06:56,661 --> 02:07:00,110
It could include Gizmos and gadgets
and all sorts of weird shit that I've

2007
02:07:00,111 --> 02:07:04,460
somehow dug up in the the
world of the esoteric as I do.

2008
02:07:04,700 --> 02:07:09,700
It could include favorite articles that
I've read and that I've shared with my

2009
02:07:10,400 --> 02:07:13,100
close friends for instance,
and it's very short.

2010
02:07:13,160 --> 02:07:18,140
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness
before you head off for the weekend.

this episode is brought
to you by Wealthfront.

2016
02:07:33,470 --> 02:07:36,040
Wealthfront is the future of advice.
They

2017
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:40,360
become incredibly popular among my
friends in silicon valley and across the

2018
02:07:40,361 --> 02:07:44,500
country because they provide the same
high end financial advice that the best

2019
02:07:44,501 --> 02:07:46,780
private wealth managers
delivered to the ultra wealthy.

2020
02:07:46,990 --> 02:07:51,160
But for any account size and at a
fraction of the cost. For instance,

2021
02:07:51,161 --> 02:07:54,800
they monitor your portfolio every day
across more than it doesn't asset classes

2022
02:07:54,820 --> 02:07:59,140
to look for opportunities to
rebalance or harvest tax losses. Now,

2023
02:07:59,920 --> 02:08:03,670
would you do the same? Are you
doing the same? Probably not.

2024
02:08:03,970 --> 02:08:08,200
And the powers in the software wealth
front now manages more than $4 billion in

2025
02:08:08,201 --> 02:08:11,110
assets,
which is up from around 2.5 billion.

2026
02:08:11,111 --> 02:08:12,820
When they started
advertising on this podcast,

2027
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:17,290
they're growing incredibly quickly. Unlike
old fashioned private wealth managers,

2028
02:08:17,291 --> 02:08:19,630
wealth front is powered
by innovative technology,

2029
02:08:19,930 --> 02:08:24,370
making it the most tax efficient,
low cost, hassle free way to invest.

2030
02:08:25,060 --> 02:08:27,850
They don't have bloated sales
teams or retail locations,

2031
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:31,610
so they can deliver all of this
sophisticated financial advice and these

2032
02:08:31,611 --> 02:08:35,050
services at a fraction of the cost
of a traditional financial advisor.

2033
02:08:35,290 --> 02:08:39,460
So at the very least, go
to wealthfront.com forward
slash Tim and take it.

2034
02:08:39,461 --> 02:08:41,260
They're free risk assessment survey.

2035
02:08:41,830 --> 02:08:43,590
It only takes a couple of
minutes and Wealthfront.

2036
02:08:43,630 --> 02:08:46,600
We'll recommend a personalized portfolio
of investments. In other words,

2037
02:08:46,601 --> 02:08:48,910
they'll tell you exactly where
they would put your money.

2038

additional information for making good

2040
02:08:54,101 --> 02:08:54,934
decisions.

2041
02:08:55,300 --> 02:08:59,290

good financial behavior and decisions

2042
02:08:59,291 --> 02:09:00,850
