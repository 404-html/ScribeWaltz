1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,810
Optimal, minimal. At this altitude,

2
00:00:02,811 --> 00:00:06,030
I can run flat out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,130
You posted a question.

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:13,990
I'm a cybernetic organism living.

5
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:26,050
This episode is brought
to you by trunk club.

6
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:29,230
There are two types of men out there.
You know who you are,

7
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:31,510
guides who love shopping for clothes,

8
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:35,980
but a short on time category a and
those of you who hate it. Category B,

9
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:38,140
I am in the latter category.

10
00:00:38,141 --> 00:00:43,141
My fashion sense is also
probably somewhere between
homeless and confused with a

11
00:00:43,361 --> 00:00:46,150
dash of lazy added in either way,

12
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:50,950
you can take heart and I've used trunk
club now and have found some of my

13
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:55,450
favorite pieces of clothing that make me
look a lot better than I would be able

14
00:00:55,451 --> 00:00:58,840
to handle on my own and there
are many reasons for that,

15
00:00:58,841 --> 00:01:02,620
but you can get clothing that fits
perfectly and looks amazing without ever

16
00:01:02,621 --> 00:01:07,240
stepping into a store. Again, thanks
to trunk club and they make it very,

17
00:01:07,241 --> 00:01:11,970
very easy and the clothing is
handpicked by a personal stylist,

18
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:13,080
your own personal stylist.

19
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,400
All you have to do is go to trunk
club.com forward slash Tim typing your

20
00:01:17,401 --> 00:01:20,130
measurements,
share your likes and dislikes.

21
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,990
They'll pick your clothes from more than
80 top brands and ship them right to

22
00:01:24,991 --> 00:01:27,810
your door. You keep what you like,
you send back what you don't.

23
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,450
If you don't like any of it, send
it all back. It doesn't matter.

24
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,720
And Trunk Club is not
a subscription service.

25
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:35,880
This is what appealed to
me among many other things.

26
00:01:35,881 --> 00:01:39,870
I didn't want to constantly be getting
dinged by things or have to deal with the

27
00:01:39,871 --> 00:01:42,870
headache of constantly getting boxes.
It's not a subscription service.

28
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,340
Shipping is always free and you have
five days to try on the clothes. So,

29
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:52,030
uh, couple of points here.
Number one, get started today.

30
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:56,080
Go to trunk club.com forward slash
Tim, try it out. You get premium,

31
00:01:56,081 --> 00:01:59,040
close expert advice, no work, no risk.

32
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,210
That is a winning Combo.

33
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:06,340
And I have found some of my favorite
espadrilles shoes from them. Bright Green.

34
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,100
Uh, I do like the color
green and they actually work.

35
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:13,300
I've had so many compliments on the
shoes and more people ask me where I got

36
00:02:13,301 --> 00:02:17,680
them than any other pair of shoes I've
ever had and more shirts I kept ended up

37
00:02:17,681 --> 00:02:21,430
keeping about. I would say three quarters
of my box, which I did not expect to do,

38
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,910
so go to trunk club.com forward slash Tim,
check it out.

39
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:31,570
This episode is brought to you by audible,
which I've used for many, many years.

40
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:34,200
I absolutely love audio books in there.

41
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:37,330
One of my favorite ways to
pass the time when I travel,

42
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,600
I'm on the road all the time and audible
allows me to consume many more books

43
00:02:41,601 --> 00:02:45,950
than I possibly could otherwise I have
to audio books to recommend right off the

44
00:02:45,951 --> 00:02:49,940
bat. The first is perhaps my favorite
audio book of all time and it's the only

45
00:02:49,941 --> 00:02:52,520
audiobook I've wanted to
listen to twice in a row.

46
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,000
The graveyard book by Neil Gaiman.
It's amazing and you will thank me.

47
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,950
There are a few different versions.

48
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,990
I like the version that
Neil narrates himself,

49
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,510
one of the most soothing
voices of all time.

50
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:08,170
The second book is
vagabonding by Rolf Potts.

51
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:12,760
P o t t s which had a huge impact on my
life and formed the basis for a lot of

52
00:03:12,761 --> 00:03:15,100
what would later become
the four hour workweek.

53
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:20,050
So go to audible.com forward slash Tim
and you can choose one of these two books

54

Ladies and germs,

63
00:03:51,071 --> 00:03:54,460
this is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another
episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

64
00:03:54,461 --> 00:03:57,790
it is my job to deconstruct world
class performers of all types,

65
00:03:57,791 --> 00:04:01,180
whether they are military strategists,
super athletes,

66
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:06,010
business icons or anything in between.
Really to tease out the habits,

67
00:04:06,011 --> 00:04:10,750
routines, favorite books, tips and tricks
you can test and apply in your own life.

68
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,840
And this episode was a real treat.

69
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:16,810
If you enjoyed my episodes
with Seth Goden, Noah Kagan,

70
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,800
any episode that really gets
into the nitty gritty details,

71
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,810
then you are going to love this one.

72
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:27,370
It is a conversation with [inaudible]
and I'll spell that for you.

73
00:04:27,371 --> 00:04:29,320
So m a,
N C H,

74
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:34,410
a I N K and I tried the English today
and you can find them on Twitter,

75
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:38,920
on social at [inaudible] and all places.

76
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:43,690
He was introduced to me
by Brian Koppelman, very,
very accomplished artists,

77
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:48,880
screenwriter, producer, cocreator
of the hit show, billions and a,

78
00:04:48,881 --> 00:04:50,950
a very,
very long filmography.

79
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:55,930
And when I asked Brian what I should dig
into with some, and he said many things,

80
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:59,380
but among others, his disc
quote, his discipline and rigor,

81
00:04:59,381 --> 00:05:02,110
carefulness of his approach
in all aspects of life.

82
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,430
He's in incredible physical condition.

83
00:05:04,431 --> 00:05:06,730
He's super careful by
fan financial security.

84
00:05:06,731 --> 00:05:08,980
He kept tutoring after
getting a three book deal.

85
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,770
He's a detailed planner and
an artist of high order,

86
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:15,880
more disciplined and organized
and businesslike than
almost any artist I've met.

87
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:19,600
So who is Soman? Well.
His debut fiction series,

88
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,840
the school for good and evil has
sold more than a million copies,

89
00:05:22,841 --> 00:05:23,730
well over a million copies.

90
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,830
Been translated into 25
languages across six continents.

91
00:05:26,831 --> 00:05:30,340
Been in New York Times bestseller for
30 weeks and will soon be a film from

92
00:05:30,341 --> 00:05:32,290
universal pictures with Soman cowriting.

93
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,730
The screenplay is a graduate of Harvard
University and Columbia University's MFA

94
00:05:36,731 --> 00:05:41,140
film program after which he began his
career as a screenwriter for film and TV.

95
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,800
He was recently named to the out 100 and
has received the $100,000 circle grant

96
00:05:46,871 --> 00:05:50,350
and the Sun Valley Writers Fellowship,
both for debut writers.

97
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:53,050
He's also an incredible tennis player,

98
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:57,720
which we will dig into and there are a
lot of parallels in a lot of between the

99
00:05:57,721 --> 00:06:01,670
two, what we talked about, his obsession
with Disney and we cover so much ground.

100
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:05,510
I think you guys will really enjoy
this episode. So pay attention,

101
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:09,890
get a notebook ready and please enjoy
my conversation with Soman Chimani.

102
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,260
Soman welcome to the show.
Thanks so much for having me.

103
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:20,590
I am sitting here with a s a set of
questions and exploratory bullets and each

104
00:06:23,061 --> 00:06:27,980
one of these could be explored for,

105
00:06:27,981 --> 00:06:30,740
I would say an hour or
two, I would guess. So we,

106
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,680
we may need around too at some point.
But I'm getting ahead of myself.

107
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:37,550
Let's start at the mutual
connection that we have.

108
00:06:37,551 --> 00:06:41,810
How do you know the incredible
Brian Koppelman and for
you people who don't know

109
00:06:41,811 --> 00:06:46,760
that name, he is a
polymath. He is a writer.

110
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,530
He cowrote rounders.

111
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,540
The illusion is I think the illusionist
he co produced and is cocreator of

112
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:56,450
billions. This a new hit show,
which I'm absolutely in love with.

113
00:06:56,451 --> 00:06:59,540
But how do you know Brian?
Well,

114
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:04,220
it started I think because in my
twenties I'd come out of film school at

115
00:07:04,221 --> 00:07:09,221
Columbia and I had gone straight to London
and had been working on a movie over

116
00:07:09,831 --> 00:07:13,400
there for a couple of years and that
was supposed to be my sort of hot shot

117
00:07:13,401 --> 00:07:17,600
debut and, and all that stuff.
And um, it ultimately fell apart.

118
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:22,190
And so I came back to New York when I
was like, you know, 25 or 26 baroque,

119
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:25,250
a quarter million dollars in debt
from college and film school.

120
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:29,300
And I didn't know how to make money,
so, you know, I didn't know what to do.

121
00:07:29,301 --> 00:07:33,860
And luckily a friend saved me and
introduced me to a couple clients and,

122
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:38,410
and told me to become an sat tutor.
And so I sort of learned overnight how to,

123
00:07:38,411 --> 00:07:42,300
how to tutor and got into
that whole business. And, um,

124
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:46,550
it just happened that Brian's
son, uh, needed a tutor.

125
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:51,320
And so that's how, that's how it
started. And so, you know, I was,

126
00:07:51,321 --> 00:07:52,970
um,
working with his son and a,

127
00:07:52,971 --> 00:07:57,440
and a bunch of his son's friends as I was
starting to write the first school for

128
00:07:57,441 --> 00:07:59,150
good, an evil book. Um,

129
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:04,180
and so he sort of watched
the entire evolution from
hot shot film maker to broke

130
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:09,650
and penniless tutor to then, you know,
rising from the ashes into a new career.

131
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:14,410
So he knows me better than
anyone. My God. Well, he's a,

132
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:18,300
he is a, he is one of your
biggest fans. I, and, uh,

133
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:22,400
his enthusiasm,
he's an enthusiastic guy to begin with.

134
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,300
But if we were to spinal
tap that and take it to 11,

135
00:08:26,301 --> 00:08:29,580
the enthusiasm with which you want
it to make the introduction, uh,

136
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,800
was of course an immediate yes.
Then on my part and one thing he mean,

137
00:08:33,801 --> 00:08:36,470
he mentioned to me and uh,

138
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:38,810
I wanted to dig into this is that,

139
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,860
well first let's back up and
this is going to be a very,

140
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,020
a non chronological interview.

141
00:08:45,021 --> 00:08:47,660
We're going to jump all over the place
cause that's what conversations to do,

142
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:48,860
but the school for good and evil,

143
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,530
how many books are there
and that series right now?

144
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,040
So there's three books in the series
right now. And then there's, um, a

145
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,790
full color kind of graphic
handbook that's uh, uh,

146
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:04,170
a companion guide that we offer to like
reluctant readers to kids who hate to

147
00:09:04,171 --> 00:09:06,750
read and will never read novels ever.

148
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,030
But if they want to be
part of the universe,

149
00:09:09,031 --> 00:09:12,120
they get this sort of
graphic version of the world.

150
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,800
So there's either the three novels or
there's the handbook and then I'm in the

151
00:09:16,801 --> 00:09:20,700
process of um,
writing the fourth one as we speak.

152
00:09:20,701 --> 00:09:25,040
And I think they'll probably be in the
end six in the series total. Um, just,

153
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:28,980
just also because the movies are going
to start to come out from universal.

154
00:09:28,981 --> 00:09:33,450
And so I wanted to have enough books to
stretch out, um, to match the movies.

155
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,900
You didn't want to end up in a,
in a game of Thrones situation

156
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:43,930
that I there at least once a week I think
of that situation and cannot imagine

157
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,350
that just because,
you know,

158
00:09:46,351 --> 00:09:51,300
I get so involved in my work and like
I take it too seriously at times.

159
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,110
And the idea that you have to share your
secrets of what's going to happen to

160
00:09:55,111 --> 00:09:58,620
somebody who then is going to put it on
TV before you, oh my God, I'd kill myself.

161
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:04,050
I couldn't do it.
So you are one of the most,

162
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,350
according to Brian, this is our
first conversation. You and I,

163
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,910
one of the most disciplined and
rigorous people he knows in all things.

164
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:13,260
And one of the adjectives,

165
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,090
adjectives he used was careful
and I wanted to explore
that because I thought it

166
00:10:18,091 --> 00:10:21,060
might lead us to some backstory. So
he said, correct me if I'm wrong,

167
00:10:21,061 --> 00:10:22,230
that you kept tutoring,

168
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:25,830
you kept doing your tutoring
after you got a three book deal.

169
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:27,803
Is that true?

170
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:32,460
I kept tutoring after we made the movie
deal and the movie deal like was enough

171
00:10:32,461 --> 00:10:36,360
for me to not have to work for
like 15 years. So you know,

172
00:10:36,361 --> 00:10:38,760
so why keep tutoring?
Uh,

173
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:43,800
just couldn't get out of my head.

174
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:48,950
The idea that art is something
that you should not depend on.

175
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:54,360
I don't like depending on my art for
income because then I start to think in a

176
00:10:54,361 --> 00:10:59,280
mercenary way. And so, you know, I had
to get through my head that it's okay.

177
00:10:59,281 --> 00:11:01,200
You know, you're, you're
making enough now from,

178
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:03,570
from the books and the movies that you,

179
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,870
you don't have to us them.

180
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:09,000
You don't have to confuse money and art.

181
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:13,410
Because the great thing about tutoring
was it took all the pressure off the book.

182
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,740
Even though I was broke at the time,
even though I had nothing going for me,

183
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,790
it meant that I could write freely because
at the end of the day my money wasn't

184
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:24,600
going to come from that book, you know?
And so I couldn't let go of tutoring.

185
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:27,350
I tutored up until last
year. It, it, you know, I,

186
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:31,650
I went like three or four years longer
than I should have because it just meant

187
00:11:31,651 --> 00:11:36,050
that I had that absolute freedom in
the back of my head that if, you know,

188
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:40,830
it all went to pot, I still had tutoring,
you know, should have is a tricky word.

189
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:44,370
Right?
Or it's a tricky contraction because it's,

190
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:49,550
I like the separation of church and state
that you described in so much as you

191
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:57,440
not feeling as though you have to
find rent money through your art,

192
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:01,430
even if your art is compensating
you well psychologically,

193
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,220
PR allowing you to compartmentalize that
you don't think about what will sell

194
00:12:06,221 --> 00:12:09,760
best as the primary directive
of your art perhaps.

195
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:12,580
Where did you grow up?
I grew up in,

196
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:16,270
in a little island off Miami
called Keybase gain. Uh,

197
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,330
that is now quite
popular as a resort town.

198
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,990
It has a Ritz Carlton.
It has a Starbucks now.

199
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:25,680
It had neither of those things
when I was growing up. It was,

200
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:30,910
it was basically just, you know,
beaches and trees when I grow up.

201
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,590
And it was very, very small. Um, but the
one thing that was famous for was tennis.

202
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:39,110
Like if you didn't play tennis
on key Biscayne, like, you know,

203
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:43,150
you weren't part of the cool crowd.
And so that's, it's a lot of, it's a,

204
00:12:43,151 --> 00:12:47,920
it's a lot of where players train
these days. Um, and still, so,

205
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:49,330
you know,
that's sort of where I grew up.

206
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:54,070
And how would you describe your,

207
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,200
I don't know what age to pick here.

208
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:01,060
It's a 10 year old self reward.
Were you a popular kid?

209
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:06,940
Let me think. No, not until high school.

210
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:11,970
And I think it was because I
just was a little confused.

211
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:14,800
I think at that age,
you know,

212
00:13:14,801 --> 00:13:17,980
I was the only Indian kid
on the island I grew up on.

213
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:22,930
I was one of three people of
color at my high school. Right.

214
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,320
And so you grow up not
looking like anyone else.

215
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:31,350
And then once I turned 12 and 13 and
I start liking guys instead of girls,

216
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,450
that adds another dimension
to the whole thing. Right.

217
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,970
And so also at the same time,

218
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,980
I'm basically six foot and at
that time I was like 110 pounds.

219
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:46,990
Wow. Could not but wait on to say
my life. Right. So all those things,

220
00:13:46,991 --> 00:13:51,670
it just felt like I just
didn't fit in any shape,

221
00:13:51,671 --> 00:13:54,700
way or form, you know, and I didn't, I
didn't know what to do. And I think it,

222
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:58,630
it led me to basically retreat into work.

223
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:03,570
And so, you know, I became the kid who,
who want everything, right? Like, uh,

224
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:08,220
they used to give out subject awards at
school. Uh, every year they give out 11,

225
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:12,640
I'm on the last day of school
and from seventh grade, you know,

226
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:16,150
through like 11th grade,
I want all 11 every single year.

227
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,870
So it was basically me just
walking back and forth,

228
00:14:19,871 --> 00:14:23,470
picking up trophies because that's
sort of what I did. You know,

229
00:14:23,471 --> 00:14:28,471
I just sort of threw myself into work
and it was only once I got to the later

230
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,220
years of high school,
11th and 12th Grade,

231
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:35,980
that I think I started to let my
real self come out a little bit.

232
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:38,680
You know, I just think it,
it broke through on its own.

233
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:42,100
And I think people started to realize
that I actually did have a sense of humor

234
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,950
for all my workaholic tendencies.
You know?

235
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:47,680
When did you become openly gay?

236
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:52,760
I think it was my senior year of college.
Um,

237
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,170
and it wasn't something bad.

238
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:58,280
It's so funny cause now I watch kids
come out and it's done with such

239
00:14:58,281 --> 00:15:01,760
empowerment and like this
kind of beautiful freedom.

240
00:15:01,761 --> 00:15:05,120
And if there's only one thing I'm sort
of envious of in the entire world,

241
00:15:05,121 --> 00:15:08,770
it's the way that, that kids come
out now. Because when, you know,

242
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:13,490
we did it in like the
early to mid two thousands,

243
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:17,990
there just wasn't anything out
there to help you, you know?

244
00:15:17,991 --> 00:15:22,910
And so it was just traumatic
having to come out to people,

245
00:15:22,911 --> 00:15:27,500
to your parents, your friends. Every time
you did it, it was just trauma. You know.

246
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:32,980
And so I think once I actually came out
is when everything sort of broke open

247
00:15:34,341 --> 00:15:36,590
and that's when,
you know,

248
00:15:36,591 --> 00:15:39,620
like I think the path I was on up until
then I thought I was going to be in

249
00:15:39,621 --> 00:15:40,281
business.

250
00:15:40,281 --> 00:15:44,420
I thought I was going to be a consultant
or a banker or any of these things.

251
00:15:44,421 --> 00:15:48,620
And it was only after I came out that
I think my creative self came back.

252
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:52,040
It was almost like that had gone
in the closet too. Um, and it,

253
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:56,900
and it took time for both to come out.
I was talking to a dear friend of mine,

254
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:58,940
Adam Robinson,

255
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:02,840
who's been on the podcast
as a guest before,

256
00:16:02,841 --> 00:16:07,841
but alongside several other people
and we just did a solo episode and uh,

257
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:13,400
he battled with depression for a long
time and I've had my own bouts with

258
00:16:13,401 --> 00:16:15,260
depression.
I'm not saying these are the same thing,

259
00:16:15,261 --> 00:16:19,000
but we had a long discussion about
one of the ingredients being you know,

260
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:24,100
authenticity meaning not following who
you are or opening up to who you are

261
00:16:25,161 --> 00:16:28,510
fully as one of the ingredients in,
in,

262
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:32,600
in that particular breed of of depression.

263
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,670
So I've thought a lot about that.

264
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:39,700
Were you able to be yourself with your
parents at a young age or did they know

265
00:16:40,461 --> 00:16:43,880
you were gay? It was that,
was that a, an open secret?

266
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,850
Could you describe your,
could you describe your,

267
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,630
your sort of dynamic with your
family? You know, my parents are,

268
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,250
are amazing.

269
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:57,050
Like they're just a both brilliant
people and both at the end of the day.

270
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:58,910
So open minded.

271
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:03,940
I don't know if it was so much about
worrying about disappointing them as much

272
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:08,060
as at that time in the world it was just,

273
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:12,680
there were no models of, of how
to do it in a, in a real way,

274
00:17:12,681 --> 00:17:16,940
especially in the sort of like
world of Indian families, you know,

275
00:17:16,941 --> 00:17:18,740
there was nothing.
So,

276
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:23,360
I don't know if it was them specifically
that scared me as much as the idea.

277
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:24,980
I didn't even know what
it would look like.

278
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,920
I thought if you come out of the closet,
you're going to live this very small,

279
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:32,000
lonely life. You know? That's what
I thought at the time. And um,

280
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:35,540
you know what's funny is once I came out,
once I became a writer,

281
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:39,020
all of these things,
I look back at that time and think,

282
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,410
thank God my life sort of
unfolded the way it did.

283
00:17:42,411 --> 00:17:45,440
Because like if you look at the school
for good and evil books, there's,

284
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:49,470
there's 120 characters, right?
Each has their own story. It's a,

285
00:17:49,471 --> 00:17:54,270
it's an entire labyrinth world that
I don't keep track of with notes.

286
00:17:54,271 --> 00:17:57,180
Like I just, I know it in my
head, everything's in my head.

287
00:17:57,181 --> 00:17:59,160
And I think all of that energy,

288
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:04,050
this entire universe of
creativity was trapped, right?

289
00:18:04,051 --> 00:18:09,051
And so no wonder I was a complete
basket case for so much in my young life

290
00:18:10,621 --> 00:18:14,940
because if you can't like,
you know, forget the gaping,

291
00:18:14,941 --> 00:18:19,170
if you're not actually like letting
out this absolute volcano of sort of

292
00:18:19,171 --> 00:18:22,890
creative energy inside of
you, um, it's gonna be rough.

293
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:27,300
And so I think that's sort of one
of the missions I have in life,

294
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:30,750
just myself is whenever I sent
another creative soul who's,

295
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:33,620
who's bottled themselves up,
um,

296
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,330
I gravitate towards them and try
to find a way to let them out.

297
00:18:36,331 --> 00:18:37,980
And that's what the
books are to sort of the,

298
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:42,150
the message of the books in there
too is for kids is, you know,

299
00:18:42,151 --> 00:18:46,860
find your tribe, right? Like it
don't, don't buy into the Matrix of,

300
00:18:46,861 --> 00:18:51,600
of what the society is telling you.
A successful person or a hero has to be,

301
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:55,440
find your tribe.
What did you major in Undergrad?

302
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:59,040
English. Um, just because you know,

303
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:02,400
when you go to a school like Harvard,
you don't know,

304
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,770
there's nothing practical,
right?

305
00:19:04,771 --> 00:19:08,760
Like a lot of the finance guys will
major in economics or government,

306
00:19:08,761 --> 00:19:13,761
but only out of just sort of default
because there isn't anything applicable at

307
00:19:14,021 --> 00:19:18,270
that at a school like Harvard.
Really. Um, so, you know,

308
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,720
in my head I knew I was going to
go into consulting or banking,

309
00:19:21,721 --> 00:19:23,640
but it didn't matter what Ma,
what you majored in.

310
00:19:23,641 --> 00:19:26,340
So I figured might as well major
in something that I actually like,

311
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,260
which was English. I remember, uh, having,

312
00:19:31,261 --> 00:19:32,094
uh,

313
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:36,780
an open Q and a not too long ago where
we were talking about where the question

314
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:41,900
was related to entrepreneurship and I
gave a response and then they interrupted

315
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,610
and they said, well, it's easy for
you to save because you, you a,

316
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,770
you're a male or went to an ivy
league school. And, and I know, no,

317
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,780
but I remember thinking to myself,

318
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:56,400
the last thing an ivy league school does
is prepare you to be an entrepreneur.

319
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,560
You're so right.
It prepares you,

320
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:03,620
it molds you to be a very well polished
hog in a fancy machine like consulting

321
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:09,540
or ibanking. But it does not
in any way probably if, if,

322
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,770
if anything,
uh,

323
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:15,930
inhibits in many respects
entrepreneurship. But that's,

324
00:20:15,931 --> 00:20:17,550
that could be a whole separate podcast.

325
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:21,000
I suppose we have to at some point do our,
our dump on Ivs,

326
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:24,360
I have so much to say.
I almost want to,

327
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:28,750
to tell like put on my forehead
that like if you went to an ivy,

328
00:20:28,751 --> 00:20:32,630
I probably won't date you, which is
like the ultimate form of self loathing.

329
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:36,420
Where,
where did,

330
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:41,420
where did film or the fiction
come into the picture?

331
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:46,980
You know, I think growing up film
was my love. Like I always wanted to,

332
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:50,050
um, be in, in film in some capacity.

333
00:20:50,051 --> 00:20:52,660
I thought that's what I
was going to end up doing.

334
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:57,990
The big problem I thought was that I
was not one of these people craving to

335
00:20:58,031 --> 00:21:00,130
direct just for directing sake. Right? I,

336
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:04,000
I didn't have this burning desire to,
you know,

337
00:21:04,001 --> 00:21:05,770
be a Spielberg or something like that.

338
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,640
I wanted to control a vision of a world.
Right?

339
00:21:09,641 --> 00:21:13,690
So I already had like a fantasy streak
inside of me. I gravitated towards,

340
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:17,710
you know, Narnia, Lord of the rings.
Um, all the, all the Grimms fairy tales,

341
00:21:17,711 --> 00:21:18,544
things like that.

342
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:24,120
And so I think ultimately what I want it
to be able to do only sort of came into

343
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:30,640
existence once JK Rowling
wrote, um, potter.

344
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:34,390
Cause once I saw potter I thought,
Oh wait,

345
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:38,560
this is like exactly sort of the,
the kind of brain I have,

346
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:43,620
which is create your own universe
control how this universe is going to be

347
00:21:43,721 --> 00:21:47,680
presented in media. Whether it's
it's books, it's film, it's whatever.

348
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:51,580
And I think that's where school for good
and evil came from at some level was

349
00:21:51,581 --> 00:21:53,710
this um,
you know,

350
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:58,770
desire to somehow bring a universe in
my head into the world in the most fully

351
00:21:59,141 --> 00:22:00,460
realized way possible.

352
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:04,900
Combining my interest in both
film and literature. You know,

353
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:06,443
so I've,
I've,

354
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:09,580
I have something I can't get out of my
head so I'm going to jump back to tennis.

355
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,300
Yeah. The first thing I was thinking
was at six foot whatever you were,

356
00:22:13,301 --> 00:22:15,670
110 pounds,
you must've had a really mean serve.

357
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,320
That was the first thing I was thinking.

358
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:22,870
And the second is really a selfish or
self interested question because I have

359
00:22:22,871 --> 00:22:27,871
been considering learning tennis this
year and you've spent an incredible amount

360
00:22:29,501 --> 00:22:33,700
of time tutoring. Granted it doesn't
sound like you were tutoring in tennis,

361
00:22:33,701 --> 00:22:38,701
but how would you recommend I learned to
play tennis for we're going to take it

362
00:22:38,861 --> 00:22:41,170
seriously and what,

363
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,710
what should I focus on and what
should I spend less time on?

364
00:22:44,711 --> 00:22:46,990
Maybe things that novices
waste a lot of time on.

365
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:49,930
Do you have any thoughts on that?
That's such a good question. It's funny,

366
00:22:49,931 --> 00:22:53,950
I'll tell you, I'll tell you how I
play to this day and it might help,

367
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,450
which is that,
you know,

368
00:22:55,451 --> 00:22:59,530
all year long in New York I play four
or five times a week. Um, you know,

369
00:22:59,531 --> 00:23:01,360
with different people and it's usually,
you know,

370
00:23:01,361 --> 00:23:03,070
we play matches where we hit or whatever.

371
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:08,520
And then every two months I go down to
Miami to the condo complex I've lived in

372
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:13,240
since I was a kid and I play with
the coach I've had since I was a kid.

373
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:15,820
I've been playing with him for 25 years.

374
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:19,120
And for context for people
listening and uh, you,

375
00:23:19,121 --> 00:23:22,870
you did not lose a first round
match for 10 years. Correct.

376
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:28,040
What happened was I went 10 years
playing tournaments all the time.

377
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,890
Um,
you know,

378
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:34,920
after this from high school up until
probably my late twenties and never lost

379
00:23:36,491 --> 00:23:39,130
the first match cause I always
felt like I had paid the entry fee.

380
00:23:39,131 --> 00:23:42,490
I had done so much work to
get there because often the
tournament was in another

381
00:23:42,491 --> 00:23:45,100
state or another country.
I would not lose.

382
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,520
It didn't matter who you put me against.

383
00:23:46,521 --> 00:23:50,810
I had this sort of like killer iron will
that would get me through that match.

384
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:53,600
And as soon as I started
writing good and evil,

385
00:23:53,601 --> 00:23:56,030
as soon as I was putting all
my creative energy elsewhere,

386
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,860
I think I lost six in a row.

387
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,340
We have to pick and choose where
you put your energy. Right.

388
00:24:01,341 --> 00:24:03,860
So I interrupted you telling me how you,
how you play though.

389
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:08,150
So I go down to Miami and I play with
the same coach I've been playing with 25

390
00:24:08,151 --> 00:24:11,270
years. He's basically 70
years old. He cannot move.

391
00:24:11,271 --> 00:24:16,271
So what he does is he takes a basket
of balls and feeds me to them.

392
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:21,760
It feeds me quite slowly and analyzes
my swing on every single one.

393
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,190
So it's 100% about technique
on 100% about timing.

394
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:28,190
It's as basic as it gets,

395
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:33,500
but it's like three or four times a year,
he's just training technique.

396
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:38,000
And if I had a kid or had to,
you know, teach somebody tennis,

397
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:40,040
it's get your technique perfect.

398
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:42,800
Because the thing about
tennis is it's so unconscious.

399
00:24:42,801 --> 00:24:47,240
If you try to consciously think your
way through the strokes or anything like

400
00:24:47,241 --> 00:24:48,300
that,
um,

401
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:51,380
you're gonna end up in trouble just
because of how fast it ultimately goes.

402
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:54,530
It's like ping pong.
So it has to become automatic.

403
00:24:54,531 --> 00:24:57,230
It has to become conscious of your
technique has to be impeccable.

404
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:00,380
And so one of the things he taught
me from an early age is, you know,

405
00:25:00,381 --> 00:25:04,850
don't rush to the baseline to start at
the service line and get your technique

406
00:25:04,851 --> 00:25:09,650
right. You know, and then things
will flow. So I became sort of a,

407
00:25:09,651 --> 00:25:12,770
a technique, um, obsessive,

408
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:16,760
which of course flows into all the other
aspects of my life because I'm big on

409
00:25:16,761 --> 00:25:20,390
technique and process.
Service line is where you serve from.

410
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,800
I know this is your service line is,

411
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:26,990
is that like the line in the
middle of the air? We go all right.

412
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:30,530
Now we're at my level things.
What the funny thing about tennis is

413
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:33,200
it rewards,

414
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:38,210
it reminds me of like gymnastics and
figure skating where rewards attention to

415
00:25:38,211 --> 00:25:42,950
detail and it a reward sort
of individualistic obsession.

416
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,500
And so it sort of,

417
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:50,180
you're talking sweet spot
of my personality. It's
just the one sport I love.

418
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:52,800
And I also think it's a
great sport where you know,

419
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:57,810
you can put me up against somebody who
is enormously big and powerful and it

420
00:25:59,091 --> 00:26:00,590
won't help them.
You know,

421
00:26:00,591 --> 00:26:04,010
it's a sport where power is not going
to do all that much for you ultimately

422
00:26:04,011 --> 00:26:07,990
against somebody who's, who's fast.
And we can see that, you know, in,

423
00:26:07,991 --> 00:26:10,670
in the men's game now with Djokovich
and Marie and all those guys.

424
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:15,980
So I have next to me literally
five inches from my left thigh.

425
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,300
I have the book I'm finishing,

426
00:26:17,301 --> 00:26:19,670
which is stories of your life
and others by Ted Chiang.

427
00:26:19,671 --> 00:26:21,800
It's science fiction
compilation of short stories.

428
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:25,370
And then right next to that is the next
book I was planning on Reading the inner

429
00:26:25,371 --> 00:26:29,600
game of tennis, uh, by Timothy
Gallway, w Timothy Gallway.

430
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,280
I don't know if that's how
you pronounce his last name,

431
00:26:31,281 --> 00:26:33,710
but where do novices waste a lot of time?

432
00:26:33,711 --> 00:26:35,810
We're going to get into
what makes a good coach.

433
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:39,460
And this is I think going to take
us a few different places, but, uh,

434
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,920
where should I, where should I
not spend a lot of time in the,

435
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:48,000
and in that relates to how
should I choose a tennis coach?

436
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:48,871
You know,

437
00:26:48,871 --> 00:26:53,871
I think one of the things is when coaches
put you against other kids very early

438
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:57,300
and you're playing matches very early
because they want to develop your

439
00:26:57,301 --> 00:27:01,500
competitive instincts. Again, I
think it's super Dunder headed.

440
00:27:01,501 --> 00:27:04,770
Cause what they don't realize is your
competitive instincts are far stronger

441
00:27:04,771 --> 00:27:07,140
than your technique,
right?

442
00:27:07,141 --> 00:27:11,910
So what you'll end up doing is coming
up with this hatchet job way of playing

443
00:27:11,911 --> 00:27:16,911
tennis that somehow we'll do the job to
when you some matches but it isn't going

444
00:27:16,991 --> 00:27:18,810
to serve you well in the long run.
Right?

445
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,550
It's like memorizing openings and chest
versus learning first principles. Yep.

446
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:24,031
Yes.

447
00:27:24,031 --> 00:27:27,270
And that's how you get to the club and
when you go to the club and you see all

448
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:31,680
these people with hacking back backhands
or like they sliced both the forehand

449
00:27:31,681 --> 00:27:34,530
and a bat and they they play in a
way that doesn't make any sense.

450
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:39,840
It's because as a kid they were put
against too many of their compatriots in

451
00:27:39,841 --> 00:27:42,360
competitive matches and we're
never taught actually how to play.

452
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:47,700
And so I think it's more about finding
a teacher who is technique and obsessive

453
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:48,421
with technique.

454
00:27:48,421 --> 00:27:51,690
I mean the coach I played with invented
the two and a backhand on tour.

455
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:55,290
He was the first person to ever use it.
It's a guy named Mike Belkin, you know,

456
00:27:55,291 --> 00:27:57,570
he played Connors at Wimbledon.

457
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:02,600
So like he all he cares about is are
you hitting the ball in the sort of like

458
00:28:04,681 --> 00:28:09,450
micro meter sweet spot. You know, I can
hit the perfect shot. He doesn't care.

459
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:12,990
He's, he's just looking at
where I hit it. Like, you know,

460
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:17,520
and ultimately I think tennis is
about knowing your weaknesses. Um,

461
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:19,290
and I think my weaknesses,
for instance,

462
00:28:19,291 --> 00:28:22,890
our weaknesses that show up in
other aspects of my life, you know?

463
00:28:22,891 --> 00:28:27,390
So having someone call me out on them a
few times a year actually helps me not

464
00:28:27,391 --> 00:28:29,070
just on the tennis court
but everywhere else.

465
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:32,670
What are some of your weaknesses
that manifest elsewhere? Oh boy.

466
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:36,810
I would say um, I mean we can just
trade weaknesses for two hours,

467
00:28:36,811 --> 00:28:39,360
but don't worry all this,
I won't do the same target interview.

468
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:42,480
He doesn't understand why
my margins are so small.

469
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:47,400
He thinks that like the comfortable way
to play tennis is to give yourself two

470
00:28:47,401 --> 00:28:51,090
inches of Netclearance.
What does that I see margins.

471
00:28:51,091 --> 00:28:54,240
You mean the space over the net with
wikis are aware it got it. Yeah.

472
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:59,360
And I mine is like two millimeters
because I just ha I hit the ball very hard

473
00:28:59,521 --> 00:29:03,180
and very flat for the lions and he doesn't
understand why everything has to be

474
00:29:03,181 --> 00:29:04,530
so dangerous,
you know,

475
00:29:04,531 --> 00:29:08,910
which is that same note I get when
I submit my books to my editor.

476
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,950
Why does everything have
to be so provocative?

477
00:29:10,951 --> 00:29:15,210
Why does everything have to be so
aggressively on the edge of what's

478
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:19,650
appropriate? What I mean so it
shows up, you know, all the time.

479
00:29:19,651 --> 00:29:24,090
I think the other two things are when I
get tense, I tend not to finish my swing,

480
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,490
which I think shows up in life also,

481
00:29:26,491 --> 00:29:30,660
which is when you're nervous or when
you're tense or when you go in with,

482
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:33,600
you know,
feeling on your heels,

483
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:37,260
you don't let the full expression
of yourself through, you know?

484
00:29:37,261 --> 00:29:40,950
So that's something that that I
think shows up and maybe also,

485
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:43,720
and this I think is a common one.

486
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:48,160
Whenever I'm going through a string of
unforced errors or anything like that in

487
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:51,730
tennis, it's because I'm hitting the
ball too early. I'm reaching for it.

488
00:29:51,731 --> 00:29:55,210
I'm not waiting for it. Like, it's
not coming into my strike zone,

489
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:58,420
I'm lurching forward for it instead of,
you know,

490
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,380
holding on a little bit.
Do you do that with, uh,

491
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:05,350
dealmaking or negotiating things like
that, or where does that, where does it,

492
00:30:05,351 --> 00:30:09,340
where else does that show up? I
think, yeah, I think sometimes it's a,

493
00:30:09,341 --> 00:30:13,390
it's a tendency to want to jump at
something and say yes to everything.

494
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:16,510
And what I'm lucky to have sort of the,

495
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:21,190
the greatest agent ever, who weirdly
enough is a lot younger than me,

496
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:25,090
who basically doesn't let me say yes to
anything. You know, he's just like, wait,

497
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:29,350
hang on. Like, you know, and it's,
it's sort of, um, start with no,

498
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:33,160
and then just build from there.
And also just, he's like,

499
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,780
it's not just saying yes,

500
00:30:34,781 --> 00:30:37,810
it's like you have to wait until
something actually excites you, you know?

501
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:42,850
So yeah. Well is, uh,
another friend of mine,

502
00:30:42,851 --> 00:30:45,430
Derek Sivers, entrepreneur would
say it's either a hell yes or it's,

503
00:30:45,431 --> 00:30:49,120
and no nothing in between. And that's
how he makes his binary decisions.

504
00:30:49,121 --> 00:30:51,970
But you brought up something that I
really want to underscore for people who

505
00:30:51,971 --> 00:30:56,320
haven't experienced it perhaps or who,
who haven't utilized it enough.

506
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:59,590
And this is a lesson that I revisit quite
a lot and sometimes forget and that is

507
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:04,900
we we talk a lot about of
uh, or stay in general, uh,

508
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:10,240
US culture talks a lot about mind
over body and, and uh, so on,

509
00:31:10,241 --> 00:31:15,241
but you can use body over mind
in so much as the sports arena,

510
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:18,910
the gym, the tennis court
can be used, like you said,

511
00:31:18,911 --> 00:31:23,650
as a way of surfacing and working on
weaknesses that then transferred to other

512
00:31:23,651 --> 00:31:24,484
areas.

513
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:28,780
And I have found that to be the case,

514
00:31:28,781 --> 00:31:33,781
which is one of the many reasons that
when my exercise regimen is consistently

515
00:31:34,181 --> 00:31:39,020
on point, everything else
improves or as easier. Uh,

516
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:42,550
so that is, that's something that I'm
focusing a lot on right now. All right,

517
00:31:42,551 --> 00:31:45,880
let's, let's, let's dig into
some of this other stuff,

518
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:51,160
uh, where to even begin. I've
so many notes in front of me.

519
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:55,480
I will start with, we talked
about tennis. I want to talk about

520
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,930
Walt Disney and Disney.

521
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:04,380
So you are apparently obsessed
with Disney Disney world.

522
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:08,530
Let's talk about it. Why don't you
just, I'll, I'll just let the door,

523
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:10,810
let the door open and we
can go from there. Well,

524
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,310
I don't know if it was by choice.

525
00:32:12,311 --> 00:32:17,230
I think what happened was we didn't have
TV growing up. We didn't have, um, cable,

526
00:32:17,231 --> 00:32:20,230
Internet, any of these things that would
keep growing it and your parents do.

527
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:24,030
Growing up that my dad was in
real estate and my mom, you know,

528
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:28,990
was a very young mom. You know, she had
three kids by 23. So, you know, it was a,

529
00:32:28,991 --> 00:32:33,400
it was a lot going on. So, um, she,

530
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:37,600
she was trying to figure out how it
all like race three kids, you know.

531
00:32:37,601 --> 00:32:38,434
And back then,

532
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:39,460
you know,

533
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:43,910
you had your VCR and your TV that played
a couple channels and that was it. So,

534
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:47,690
um, we used to complain a lot to
them that we had nothing to watch.

535
00:32:47,691 --> 00:32:49,520
We didn't have an intender,
we didn't have anything.

536
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:54,550
And so my grandparents finally relented
and came home with the entire Disney

537
00:32:54,831 --> 00:32:57,710
animated collection on Vhs,
which was like,

538
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:00,710
I think 27 movies or something like that.
Um,

539
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,740
and that is all I watched from what,
from age,

540
00:33:03,741 --> 00:33:07,430
maybe six or seven until 15.
That was all that was in the house.

541
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:10,400
So like that was our only
source of entertainment.

542
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:15,430
And so I think Disney at some level
infected every cell of my brain.

543
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:20,060
And it became for good or for good or bad,
um,

544
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:23,910
sort of an essential part of how
I thought about the world. Um,

545
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:28,420
and it was only later on, you
know, once I got to college, uh,

546
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:31,910
I took a class on sort of a famous
class at Harvard on fairy tales,

547
00:33:31,911 --> 00:33:36,620
taught by a professor named Maria to tar,
who has become sort of like, you know,

548
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:39,710
the, the most famous expert
on fairy tales in the world.

549
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:43,610
And she exposed me to the
original grim stories,

550
00:33:43,611 --> 00:33:46,820
which are horrific and dark and insane.

551
00:33:46,821 --> 00:33:49,820
And half the time the evil character
wins and half the time the good character

552
00:33:49,821 --> 00:33:52,360
wins.
And I think that gap between the,

553
00:33:52,361 --> 00:33:56,620
the Disney stories I grew up with and
I took so seriously and the wheel fairy

554
00:33:56,621 --> 00:33:59,780
tales is where the school
for getting evil started.

555
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:04,840
Because the question that kept sticking
in my head is why did kids 200 years ago

556
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:08,120
grew up with stories where
the hero didn't always win,

557
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:12,950
where the hero died a horrible
death if they made a mistake.

558
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,690
And we got these very sanitized versions
of the story where the hero always wins,

559
00:34:17,691 --> 00:34:20,840
even if the hero is not
particularly smart. You know,

560
00:34:20,841 --> 00:34:21,950
you look at the Little Mermaid,

561
00:34:21,951 --> 00:34:26,390
you look at the Lion King Ariel should
die brutally in that movie because she's

562
00:34:26,391 --> 00:34:30,260
an idiot
pleat idiot.

563
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:33,020
I mean the number of mistakes she makes
in that movie, it doesn't make any sense.

564
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:35,930
So then to read the Little Mermaid,
the original,

565
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:39,020
where she dies at the end
suddenly made sense. Right?

566
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:43,760
And I think that's where I started
thinking, okay, how do we get kids in,

567
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:46,460
in our world to get the real stories?

568
00:34:46,461 --> 00:34:50,150
How do you get them to start reading
something we're good and evil and balance

569
00:34:50,151 --> 00:34:52,820
where we're actually mean
something. Again, you know,

570
00:34:52,821 --> 00:34:57,620
and I think all of that stuff, and then
the arrival of Potter, um, you know,

571
00:34:57,621 --> 00:34:58,820
my knowledge of Disney,

572
00:34:58,821 --> 00:35:02,660
that all sort of played into what the
skull fucking evil ultimately became,

573
00:35:02,661 --> 00:35:04,830
which is sort of a mix of all of that,
um,

574
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:08,350
with an attempt to give fairy
tales back to children and,

575
00:35:08,351 --> 00:35:11,150
and sort of make them really
think about what good and evil is.

576
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:17,770
I remember reading the original
Hansel and Gretel stories,

577
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:20,960
a few variations,
and there's an illustrated version.

578
00:35:20,961 --> 00:35:25,130
People can check out if they want. They
should read it before their kids read it,

579
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:30,290
uh, which I think you'll game
and played a part in which,

580
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:34,820
uh,
really underscores how brutal it's brutal.

581
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:37,770
Some of these stories were. And, uh,

582
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,050
let's have you said,

583
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:43,440
I have thought a lot about
Disney in the last few years,

584
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:47,670
but I've thought about Disney more
so in the capacity of Walt Disney.

585
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,740
And there is a,
uh,

586
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:53,530
there's a fantastic Walt Disney museum
here in San Francisco for 10 dying to

587
00:35:53,531 --> 00:35:58,300
come out. So good. It's so good. And
it looks at Walt Disney, the thinker,

588
00:35:58,301 --> 00:36:00,880
Walt Disney, the a imagineer, et Cetera,

589
00:36:00,881 --> 00:36:05,570
but also Walt Disney that the
technology innovator. But I,

590
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,520
it's Glenn Beck of all people,
uh,

591
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:12,940
has a book and he carried it
with him for some period of time.

592
00:36:12,941 --> 00:36:15,050
And my understanding is
that it inspired Disney.

593
00:36:15,051 --> 00:36:17,270
World's the garden cities of tomorrow by,

594
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,680
I've read that book you have by Sir
Ebenezer George Howard. Have you,

595
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:23,650
have you been to Disney
world? Uh, 40 times,

596
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,213
40 times.

597
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:27,760
Uh, you know, like I said,

598
00:36:27,761 --> 00:36:32,761
Disney was somebody that I admired so
much that I came to a point where once you

599
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:37,750
started admiring someone and, and studying
them, you start to see their flaws.

600
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:40,930
And that's where you start to
see the seeds of your own career.

601
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:44,200
Because I think once you have an idol
and you studied them long enough and you

602
00:36:44,201 --> 00:36:47,620
realize their weaknesses,
you think, oh wait, I can,

603
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:52,150
I can come in here with my own voice
and do something totally different.

604
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:57,220
That's going to ultimately, you
know, be, be its own thing. Um,

605
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:00,310
and so I studied all that
stuff because I was fascinated.

606
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:04,090
The most important thing that I was
fascinated about with Disney is his desire

607
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:08,650
to create his own city. He was obsessed
with this idea of creating his own,

608
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,250
um, not just, you know, Walt
Disney world amusement park.

609
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:16,480
He wanted his own model community that
the rest of the world would then adopt.

610
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:20,770
That's what Epcot was supposed to be. Um,
you know, it, it never ended up happening.

611
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:24,160
And then, you know, for whatever reason
they abandoned it after his death.

612
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:26,670
But I think, you know, once I'm
done with school for good and evil,

613
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:29,780
I'm dying to do another series about that.

614
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:32,320
Sort of analogous to this idea of,

615
00:37:32,321 --> 00:37:34,630
of what the perfect city
of the future looks like.

616
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:39,730
You bring up something that I'd
like to add two, which is the,

617
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:44,860
the benefit in a way of heroes
with clay feet. And uh, so there's,

618
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,230
people have probably heard
the recommendation, never
meet your heroes. Uh, and the,

619
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:55,590
that is said because of the fear and the
reality that oftentimes when you meet

620
00:37:56,351 --> 00:37:59,200
the people you most admire,
they disappoint you in some way.

621
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:02,500
There is some type of flaw,
there's some type of weakness.

622
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:07,960
And it's the,
the frame to have,

623
00:38:07,961 --> 00:38:10,870
I think that is more enabling is
the one that you just described.

624
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:13,930
And that is you shouldn't be,
well actually I shouldn't,

625
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:16,750
you're allowed to be disappointed.
You can be disappointed,

626
00:38:16,751 --> 00:38:18,940
but even if you feel
disappointed in some way,

627
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:24,180
everyone is flawed and that should just
encourage you because it humanizes them.

628
00:38:24,371 --> 00:38:29,170
You realize, okay, they're
not some infallible, uh,

629
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:29,951
you know,

630
00:38:29,951 --> 00:38:34,720
metaphorically some entrepreneurial or
fill in the blank who is hitting every

631
00:38:34,721 --> 00:38:36,010
foul a hundred times

632
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:39,820
out of 100. It's like, no, they have real
weaknesses and that then, like you said,

633
00:38:39,821 --> 00:38:44,821
opens the door to the possibility that
you could do something of that magnitude.

634
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:49,990
US. I find it really encouraging
in a way, uh, when I,

635
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:54,850
when I explore the weaknesses of
people that I really, really admire.

636
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:59,500
Uh, so, so in any case, I
appreciate you making, uh,

637
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:04,060
making that point. You know, the
paradox of heroes. Uh, what is,

638
00:39:04,061 --> 00:39:08,670
what does one of your, if you have
one favorite failures because a,

639
00:39:08,671 --> 00:39:12,580
I think a lot of people listening will
think to themselves, good God. All right.

640
00:39:12,581 --> 00:39:17,260
So this guy just seems to be
a savant in everything. Uh,

641
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:21,910
I can't, I don't have those attributes.
Um, so let's, let's talk about some,

642
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:26,320
some failure. Uh, you do, do
you have a favorite failure,

643
00:39:26,321 --> 00:39:30,790
meaning a failure that in retrospect,

644
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:35,800
a really planted the seeds of,
of leader's success? You know,

645
00:39:35,801 --> 00:39:36,760
I think,
um,

646
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,430
one small one and one
big one, uh, which was,

647
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:47,410
I had sort of tested school for
getting evil at film school, um, in a,

648
00:39:47,411 --> 00:39:49,660
in a three page treatment of the story.

649
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:55,060
And the professor was this old tra jockey,

650
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:58,960
you're talking patriarchal culture,
you know,

651
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:00,460
and trenching kind of guy.

652
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:06,090
And I submitted it and I went in to
talk to him at office hours and he goes,

653
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:09,670
so let's talk about this story you wrote
about an Indian family. And I said,

654
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:15,120
I didn't write the Indian anything.
And he's like, he's like, well,

655
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:18,610
which one? He didn't have names on
them or he hadn't looked at the names.

656
00:40:18,611 --> 00:40:20,050
He's like, well, which one was yours?

657
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,980
And then like you got distracted and was
talking about how his favorite one was

658
00:40:23,981 --> 00:40:25,450
this one about fairy tales.
And he's like,

659
00:40:25,451 --> 00:40:29,350
whoever the girl that wrote it was like,
she has a future, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah.

660
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,320
And I said, that one's a mine. And he,

661
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:36,760
his face just totally changed and he
couldn't get over the idea that I had

662
00:40:36,761 --> 00:40:39,100
written it that like,
you know,

663
00:40:39,101 --> 00:40:42,870
that a boy had written
that story that start,

664
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,810
that had a female lead character was
that in the world of fairy tales.

665
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,790
And he never sort of,

666
00:40:48,791 --> 00:40:51,280
we never went over it because he
couldn't get over the shock of it.

667
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:56,020
And there was something in that
moment that I think I took badly.

668
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:59,650
I think I got ashamed of it.
And had I had,

669
00:40:59,651 --> 00:41:04,330
I reacted with a little more
self competence at 23 or 24,

670
00:41:04,331 --> 00:41:05,350
however I old I was,

671
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:09,750
I would've taken the positive comment
he had given more than the negative one.

672
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,720
Do you? I mean, but for some reason
I felt embarrassed by it. Um,

673
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:15,160
so that was something that I wish,

674
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:18,700
but it was an important one because I
think years later when I came back to it

675
00:41:18,701 --> 00:41:22,660
with a little more self esteem, I was
like, out of all the kids in the class,

676
00:41:22,661 --> 00:41:26,110
he liked that one the best. Why
didn't I run with it? That was like a,

677
00:41:26,111 --> 00:41:29,260
it was a serious idea.
The failure that came,

678
00:41:29,261 --> 00:41:32,980
that became sort of the cornerstone in
my life happened after I graduated film

679
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:37,370
school, which was, I came
out sort of the hot graduate.

680
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:42,190
I got picked up by ca, um, off a script
that had wine. Don't know, just sorry,

681
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:42,980
just for context.

682
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:47,330
A CAA is one of the largest
talent agencies in the world,

683
00:41:47,331 --> 00:41:52,100
if not the largest, but it's
CAA, WME William Morris Endeavor.

684
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:56,500
Uh, there, there are a handful of
these uta out there with ca is one of,

685
00:41:56,570 --> 00:41:59,750
one of the big mother ships.
And so they had,

686
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:03,060
they had picked me up and this
scripted won a ton of stuff and,

687
00:42:03,061 --> 00:42:05,360
and it had won this big grant.

688
00:42:05,361 --> 00:42:10,361
And so I immediately got a studio
deal out of England to make the movie.

689
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,170
Um, for, I think it was
a $6 million budget,

690
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:20,120
which is ridiculous for a graduate or a
movie that you wrote for a movie I wrote.

691
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:24,770
Um, and so, you know, it
was, it was sort of the,

692
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:29,660
almost like an autobiographical story
at some level with some fantasy elements

693
00:42:29,661 --> 00:42:34,460
to it. And so I moved to London. I
spent a year and a half prepping it,

694
00:42:34,461 --> 00:42:38,420
doing all the work to get it ready.
You know, we had crews, a setup,

695
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:42,770
we had a great cast, we had everything
set and it was, um, you know,

696
00:42:42,771 --> 00:42:47,150
right at a bad time in the
industry financially and
the studio and had three or

697
00:42:47,151 --> 00:42:49,990
four flops in a row.
And then there,

698
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:53,150
their big movie came out
and died and that was it.

699
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:57,200
They went bankrupt six weeks before
we were starting shooting. Um,

700
00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:02,390
and that was it. That was in a year and a
half. I lost everything I had worked on,

701
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,021
uh,
you know,

702
00:43:03,021 --> 00:43:07,640
worked for all those years and
I just didn't know what to do.

703
00:43:07,641 --> 00:43:10,880
And I remember going home and that's when
I started tutoring and all that stuff.

704
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:15,050
But the biggest thing that came out of
there is I remember thinking, never again,

705
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,490
that's never going to happen again.

706
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:20,120
I'm never going to work on something for
two years and putting my life and soul

707
00:43:20,121 --> 00:43:22,610
in it and not have it
see the light of day.

708
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:26,660
And that's when I realized there has
to be a way to control your Ip, right?

709
00:43:26,661 --> 00:43:27,790
There has to be a way to,

710
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:32,150
to control the creative property so
that you know you can be in charge.

711
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:34,610
And that's when I started thinking,
you know,

712
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:39,350
why don't I go back to what I was
always meant to do, which was fantasy.

713
00:43:39,351 --> 00:43:43,130
And what if I start with it as books
first? You know, what can I do?

714
00:43:43,131 --> 00:43:44,960
But even then I thought,
all right,

715
00:43:44,961 --> 00:43:48,350
say I write a book and it
comes out and no one reads it.

716
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:53,390
Then we're back at square one. And so
I did a lot of investigation into the,

717
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:58,040
the kids book industry. And this is
where I found sort of the magic secret,

718
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:02,950
which is I watched a lot of
authors going on tour, um,

719
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:06,260
who wrote kids and teen books.
And if you're a teen author,

720
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:08,060
you tour like an adult author does,

721
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:11,690
you just go to bookstores every night in
different cities and you meet your fans,

722
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:16,580
which you know is great. But if you don't
have any fans, then there's no point,

723
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:21,560
right? If you write for kids eight
to 12, you don't go to bookstores.

724
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:22,071
Instead,

725
00:44:22,071 --> 00:44:25,310
they send you to schools and you're
putting in front of captive audiences

726
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:29,210
anywhere from 200 to a thousand
kids at a time who, you know,

727
00:44:29,211 --> 00:44:32,850
don't know anything about you and you
an hour to sell your book three times a

728
00:44:32,851 --> 00:44:37,720
day to three different schools. And
I thought, okay, that I can do that.

729
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:38,910
I,
if you,

730
00:44:38,911 --> 00:44:43,440
if I write a book good enough and you
put me on tour and I get to see 3000 kids

731
00:44:43,441 --> 00:44:47,730
a day, I can sell. And that's
what got me, got me going.

732
00:44:47,731 --> 00:44:51,030
I realized I could control the
creative and the business side of it.

733
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:54,980
And for someone who lives their
life wanting control, it was, um,

734
00:44:55,290 --> 00:45:00,060
I saw a career waiting to happen, you
know, so it looks like an accident,

735
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:03,690
I guess. But I had, I had sort
of seen how it could be done.

736
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:09,410
So I want to talk about the selling
and now that the more I hear three,

737
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:13,230
three times a day, a thousand
kids at a time, I'm like,

738
00:45:13,231 --> 00:45:16,920
why have I not been choosing
my genres more intelligently?

739
00:45:16,921 --> 00:45:21,270
Because you can show up to a gigantic
book signing even if you've had successful

740
00:45:21,271 --> 00:45:26,130
books and have 12 people or two people.
I remember going to the UK,

741
00:45:26,131 --> 00:45:28,470
I've never,
so just as a contrast,

742
00:45:28,471 --> 00:45:33,471
I've never done what anyone would
consider a book tour because if after I

743
00:45:35,491 --> 00:45:39,270
remember the four hour work week came out
and I went to the UK and I expected to

744
00:45:39,271 --> 00:45:41,520
have this fantastic launch
and it did pretty well,

745
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:45,270
but they want it to rely on everything
that happened in the u s and I remember

746
00:45:45,271 --> 00:45:48,290
going to my first book signing that the,

747
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:52,200
the publisher in the UK was
handling and I showed up and it was,

748
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:56,400
I don't remember the exact name of the
bookstore show up at seven o'clock or

749
00:45:56,401 --> 00:45:57,510
eight o'clock at night.

750
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:01,770
It's raining outside and
literally over two hours,

751
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,390
two people showed up.

752
00:46:03,391 --> 00:46:08,010
One person who was just wandering around
and wanted to talk to me about things,

753
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:11,100
anything that was unrelated to my book.

754
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:14,880
And then one person who had already
bought the book somewhere else, you know,

755
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:19,860
nothing, nothing brings you back to
earth like the British. Oh my God.

756
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:24,120
It was just such a punch in the
nuts. And, uh, after that I was like,

757
00:46:24,121 --> 00:46:27,930
no more much like yourself,
different contexts, but I
was like, never again ever,

758
00:46:27,931 --> 00:46:31,770
ever in my life. Am I going to have
my head's stuffed into the toilet?

759
00:46:31,771 --> 00:46:34,950
This hard from like an ego,
uh, demolishing standpoint. But

760
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,410
I digress. That's my, that is my want.

761
00:46:38,411 --> 00:46:41,970
And I think it's important because
also I think at some point,

762
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:46,530
you know all the principles that
you believe in and that, you know,

763
00:46:46,531 --> 00:46:51,531
I've been reading your books for years
on and immediately sends to fellow soul.

764
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:55,560
Um, you know, who is
interested in the same things.

765
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:57,870
All that stuff kids need.

766
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:02,850
And the school for good and evil in a
weird sense is kind of a fictionalized

767
00:47:02,851 --> 00:47:06,540
expression of all this stuff.
We're talking about, right.
It's everything, you know,

768
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:11,540
I believe in about the world and, and
making your own destiny and planning and,

769
00:47:11,541 --> 00:47:16,260
and not fitting in, you know, to,
to society's constructs. And so,

770
00:47:16,590 --> 00:47:17,190
you know,

771
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:22,110
people who want to raise their kids with
those values I hope would then find,

772
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:24,360
you know, interest in the
books. But at the same time,

773
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:27,960
I think your due to write
a kid's version of yours,

774
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:32,620
cause I just think teenagers more
than anything need it. You know,

775
00:47:32,621 --> 00:47:37,570
and parents will buy it because they
know you. So, you know, I think it's,

776
00:47:37,571 --> 00:47:40,660
it's coming. Well it might, it might.

777
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:43,290
I've been very intimidated.
Uh,

778
00:47:43,590 --> 00:47:48,590
and then I'm going to come back to the
coming out of college and film school,

779
00:47:50,350 --> 00:47:52,510
a quarter of $1 million in
debt because I think that's,

780
00:47:52,690 --> 00:47:55,680
that's an important topic to dig into.
But I've,

781
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:59,470
I've been very intimidated by a in,
in a very,

782
00:47:59,471 --> 00:48:01,660
I think good way.
Uh,

783
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:06,070
some what I would call and
the genre names are confusing.

784
00:48:06,071 --> 00:48:08,710
So young adult fiction,

785
00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:13,890
like 13 plus 13 plus when when
I picked up this was high,

786
00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:19,810
don't know, 2005. Actually
I know exactly when it was.

787
00:48:19,811 --> 00:48:24,010
It was 2005 because it was when I was
doing my walk about around the world prior

788
00:48:24,011 --> 00:48:26,590
to the four hour workweek when
I was doing all my experiments,

789
00:48:26,591 --> 00:48:31,210
I was in Panama and I was reading
his dark materials, Phillip Pullman,

790
00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:32,590
the Golden Compass,

791
00:48:33,130 --> 00:48:38,020
and I had to look up
probably two or three words,

792
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:42,220
a page to define them for myself.
I mean nautical terms,

793
00:48:42,490 --> 00:48:43,510
all sorts of stuff.

794
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:47,710
And I remember wondering
who the audience was.

795
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:50,830
I'll blow your mind on that one.
Golden Compass.

796
00:48:50,831 --> 00:48:54,100
And Philip Pullman is not young adult.
That's middle grade.

797
00:48:54,490 --> 00:48:57,330
That's eight to 12 watts. I it, it's,

798
00:48:57,430 --> 00:49:00,800
I consider myself pretty well
educated guy. Yeah, no, he's in,

799
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,590
he's intense and I think,
but he's part of the whole specter that,

800
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:09,340
that I aspire to as well,
which is if you look at Narnia,

801
00:49:09,341 --> 00:49:13,480
if you look at Golden Compass,
even if you look at potter, um,

802
00:49:14,590 --> 00:49:19,540
middle grade is where you find the books
that really transcend to adults as well

803
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:23,810
because is never missing a story is
would that be considered middle? Yeah,

804
00:49:23,890 --> 00:49:26,010
never ending story as well.
I think the problem,

805
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:29,950
that was my favorite favorite book
growing up in a for three or four years.

806
00:49:29,951 --> 00:49:33,160
And in elementary school it's,
it's an amazing book.

807
00:49:33,161 --> 00:49:38,161
And I think the thing with a lot of
young adult is it's there to gratify,

808
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:44,170
you know, specific teenage impulses
from 13 to 17 so it's a very,

809
00:49:44,171 --> 00:49:49,120
very sort of melodramatic and
romance based at times, you know,

810
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:52,840
and I think romance becomes sort of a,
an essential element of it.

811
00:49:52,841 --> 00:49:57,700
Whereas in middle grade you will often
find the more high fantasy, you know,

812
00:49:57,701 --> 00:49:59,890
that you would also find an adult fiction,

813
00:49:59,891 --> 00:50:03,790
which is why I think often some of them,
the best books that crossover things,

814
00:50:03,791 --> 00:50:07,630
like even like if you look at the best,
Neil Gaiman, like the graveyard book,

815
00:50:07,631 --> 00:50:09,970
these are, these are middle
grade books, you know.

816
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:15,080
So like my favorite audio book of all
time probably is read by Neil himself.

817
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:18,220
It's, oh good. And so, you know, that's,

818
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:23,140
that's also why I love this genre because
you know, school for good and evil,

819
00:50:23,141 --> 00:50:27,010
for instance, the number of adult fans
we have is insane. Do you, I mean,

820
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:30,810
there's no way we would sell as much as
we have sold and been able to do what we

821
00:50:30,811 --> 00:50:33,050
have done without adult readers.

822
00:50:33,051 --> 00:50:36,170
What happens is the kids get obsessed
and then they give it to their parents.

823
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:39,860
The parents read it, and then they
start getting into it. You know, the,

824
00:50:39,861 --> 00:50:44,630
the trick with the middle grade series
is that the first book has to be a little

825
00:50:44,631 --> 00:50:46,640
younger.
That's why the first Harry Potter book,

826
00:50:46,730 --> 00:50:50,690
they can grow into the rest of the series.
It's, it has to feel like a kid's book.

827
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:54,230
It has to sort of like
get the kids you know,

828
00:50:54,530 --> 00:50:57,650
into it at some level. Um, and then,

829
00:50:57,740 --> 00:51:00,620
then you can start getting deeper
and deeper and deeper. And that's,

830
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:02,000
that's sort of how it's done.

831
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:05,930
Which is why even if you look at his
dark materials, golden compass is,

832
00:51:06,590 --> 00:51:11,450
is a little bit easier, but then two
and three are intense. Top tough. Well,

833
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:13,670
you mentioned controlling your Ip,

834
00:51:13,671 --> 00:51:18,671
your intellectual property so that you
would be the master of your fate more

835
00:51:19,041 --> 00:51:21,860
than you had been when this,
this,

836
00:51:21,861 --> 00:51:25,490
this film evaporated in front of you,
that you were going to work on

837
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:28,460
golden compass.

838
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:34,300
One of my favorite books in that genre
or one of the worst movies I've ever seen

839
00:51:35,181 --> 00:51:39,550
in my life. And I was so fucking
enraged when I came out of that theater.

840
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:42,440
I was like, how could you, how could you,

841
00:51:42,441 --> 00:51:47,441
I was so upset that they tried to cram
one and a half or two of these gigantic

842
00:51:47,481 --> 00:51:52,160
gorgeous books into 90 minutes or whatever
it was. It just, it just infuriated me.

843
00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:53,383
How,

844
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:58,130
what have you done or how do you think
about protecting the integrity of your

845
00:51:58,131 --> 00:52:01,430
work? How to, how do you go about
ensuring that is likely to be the case?

846
00:52:01,431 --> 00:52:05,920
Because I'm not going to generalize,
but yes, I am. I'm going to you,

847
00:52:05,921 --> 00:52:10,220
you don't want to take people's word
for it in Hollywood or anywhere else.

848
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:13,730
That's just, there are too many players
are too many cooks in the kitchen.

849
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:16,430
So what do you do? Um, well,

850
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:20,180
first thing I do is I have this piece
of paper and anytime I get on the phone

851
00:52:20,181 --> 00:52:23,180
with anyone from La,
uh,

852
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:26,690
I put it on my wall and
it says they are lying.

853
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:35,610
Um, so I have, I've been doing that for
about three years and it really, because

854
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:40,580
they are lying,
they're saying whatever they need to say.

855
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:43,050
It's the great thing about,
you know,

856
00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:45,100
Hollywood is once you
figure out that it has,

857
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:49,790
is that essentially the
same kind of engine as,

858
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:54,170
as the political system designed
to slow things down, designed to,

859
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:57,710
to make things move as slowly as possible.

860
00:52:58,310 --> 00:53:00,980
And you start to realize that it's
essentially like working with Congress.

861
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:05,900
Then for some reason you start to
accept it, you know, a little more. Um,

862
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:08,960
I think the difference with me
is I come from that world, right?

863
00:53:08,961 --> 00:53:12,010
So like I had gone to film
school, I'd come out, um, and,

864
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:15,200
and been involved with not just the
movie that you know, had evaporated,

865
00:53:15,201 --> 00:53:18,140
but I was getting offered a
lot of projects at that time.

866
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:23,300
And so I had met a lot of people.
So when it came to, to, you know,

867
00:53:23,301 --> 00:53:25,060
selling the rights of
school for good an evil,

868
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:30,570
I got to pick who it was.
I didn't just go with whoever gave,

869
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:35,370
you know, the, the best offer. So I've put
together the producing team, which was,

870
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:36,390
um,
you know,

871
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:40,050
Jane starts who did Ella enchanted and
tuck everlasting and is and is known for

872
00:53:40,051 --> 00:53:45,051
putting together the most
faithful children's adaptations
of all classic books.

873
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:50,370
I mean, that's her, her reputation and
then put her together with Joe Roth,

874
00:53:50,371 --> 00:53:54,270
who is Alice in Wonderland Maleficent,
you know, Snow White and the Huntsman,

875
00:53:54,510 --> 00:53:57,210
who's the big blockbuster
fairy tale producer.

876
00:53:57,540 --> 00:54:02,070
And sort of that combination has
been kind of the magic bullet, um,

877
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,030
because a,

878
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:06,960
I got to make sure that I wrote the first
couple of drafts of the script to make

879
00:54:06,961 --> 00:54:10,010
sure that we were in the right
direction before I stepped off to,

880
00:54:10,370 --> 00:54:14,850
to keep working on the box. And then it
made sure that we got on somebody who,

881
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:19,620
um, a new screen writer, you
know, who would, who would
put in the studio's notes,

882
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:22,260
who also loved the books at,
which turned out to be,

883
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:27,240
right now it's David McGee who wrote
finding Neverland life of Pi and is doing

884
00:54:27,241 --> 00:54:31,410
the new Mary Poppins for Disney. And his
daughters loved the book. So, you know,

885
00:54:31,411 --> 00:54:34,660
I've been reading every single draft of
the script. I've been involved, you know,

886
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:36,990
every step of the way.
And it,

887
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:40,680
I as of now could not be
more faithful to the books.

888
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:44,250
That is not to say that it will not end
up being the worst movie of all time.

889
00:54:44,251 --> 00:54:46,740
That has nothing to do with the series.
But you know,

890
00:54:46,741 --> 00:54:50,220
all you can do as an author is,
I would say the,

891
00:54:50,221 --> 00:54:54,390
the advice would be hold on to it until
you put together the right team yourself.

892
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:58,230
You don't just hand it
over. How do you, uh,

893
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:02,550
whether it's through
social engineering and just

894
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:07,530
managing relationships
in a particular way,

895
00:55:07,531 --> 00:55:12,531
how do you minimize the likelihood of
really stupid studio notes getting forced

896
00:55:14,791 --> 00:55:16,440
into your script?
You know,

897
00:55:16,441 --> 00:55:20,240
I think that time has helped because
of social media. You know, the,

898
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:25,250
the fan base of the series is
getting bigger and bigger by the day.

899
00:55:25,291 --> 00:55:29,670
And I think they have learned from too
many things like golden compass are

900
00:55:29,671 --> 00:55:30,840
beautiful creatures or,

901
00:55:31,110 --> 00:55:35,760
or movies where the fans revolted
before it ever came out. You know,

902
00:55:35,761 --> 00:55:40,320
and you have to have the fans on
board because at the end of the day,

903
00:55:40,650 --> 00:55:43,140
they're the ones who are going to
make all the noise. Right. You know,

904
00:55:43,141 --> 00:55:47,810
like my biggest goal when I
wrote good evil was, you know,

905
00:55:48,170 --> 00:55:49,860
like, look, the way to,

906
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:53,850
to make a success is not necessarily
the most readers straight off the bat,

907
00:55:53,851 --> 00:55:55,800
but to have the most passionate ones,
you know,

908
00:55:56,130 --> 00:56:00,750
so well they become your marketing for
us. That's it. And that's everything.

909
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:01,530
And you know,

910
00:56:01,530 --> 00:56:06,530
to this day I spend at least half an
hour a day doing fan engagement to make

911
00:56:06,961 --> 00:56:10,110
sure that, that the people who
love the books most, you know,

912
00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:12,390
get as much access as possible.
Uh,

913
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:15,720
what have you found most effective
for that in that half hour? Well,

914
00:56:15,721 --> 00:56:19,290
it's tricky because with
eight to 12 our core fan base,

915
00:56:19,291 --> 00:56:23,380
I don't think it's really eight to 12
it's more like 10 to 15 but I think they

916
00:56:23,381 --> 00:56:26,410
are not on social media so much.
Right? They're not on Twitter,

917
00:56:26,411 --> 00:56:27,340
they're not on Instagram.

918
00:56:27,341 --> 00:56:31,810
So we built an interactive website that
is I think the best of any kid series in

919
00:56:31,811 --> 00:56:35,290
the world in terms of how
complex and how much it offers.

920
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:38,980
There's 18 moderated chat rooms.
There's like games,

921
00:56:38,981 --> 00:56:41,380
there's contests every week
we have a youtube channel,

922
00:56:41,381 --> 00:56:45,730
like there's so much for them to do there
and there's a forum in the in the chat

923
00:56:45,731 --> 00:56:50,450
forums called questions for Soman and
they can ask me questions, you know,

924
00:56:50,770 --> 00:56:54,280
anytime they want and I go on half an
hour a day and answer them all. God,

925
00:56:54,281 --> 00:56:55,810
it got centralized now.

926
00:56:55,811 --> 00:56:59,510
You all right now each,

927
00:56:59,810 --> 00:57:04,630
we'll get a little lay this out. So each
year looking at, looking at some specs,

928
00:57:05,410 --> 00:57:09,190
your player stats, these are really
stats, but you write a 500 to 700 page,

929
00:57:09,191 --> 00:57:12,970
book your tour, 60 to 80 days,
film a weekly Youtube show,

930
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:14,950
work on film,

931
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:20,510
manage the business side of the
school for good and evil. Um,

932
00:57:21,250 --> 00:57:24,070
plus parenthetical,
you're single at the moment,

933
00:57:24,071 --> 00:57:27,850
which is a part time job in and of itself.
How New York,

934
00:57:27,851 --> 00:57:31,750
which is not just the part that
it's like death of your soul.

935
00:57:31,870 --> 00:57:34,630
Well you also have in New York
that it's a whole separate,

936
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:39,970
you have the extra layer of paradox
of choice, plan, shopping issue.

937
00:57:39,971 --> 00:57:40,900
There's a,
there's a,

938
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:44,800
there's an abundance of riches in some
respects that makes it challenging.

939
00:57:44,801 --> 00:57:48,580
But what is your time
management look like?

940
00:57:48,610 --> 00:57:51,340
What are the keys to your time management?
What do you do differently?

941
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:52,660
I know there's a lot of questions,

942
00:57:52,661 --> 00:57:55,900
but I'd love for you just to describe
how you keep things in order and

943
00:57:55,901 --> 00:57:59,530
prioritized. Well, I think
the, there few tricks,

944
00:57:59,531 --> 00:58:04,531
the big trick is one day a week is
where anything not essential happens.

945
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:12,480
So like if I have to meet my
agent or get a haircut or like go,

946
00:58:13,530 --> 00:58:17,140
you know, do some press thing or
a radio interview or something,

947
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:20,920
all of that happens on one day.
So like everything gets shoved into,

948
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:22,300
usually it's Tuesday,

949
00:58:22,301 --> 00:58:26,890
Tuesday becomes the like the funnel
day for anything miscellaneous.

950
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:31,660
Yeah. And so, you know, I think
that becomes the main day.

951
00:58:31,661 --> 00:58:36,590
And then I think for me it's all
about segments, you know, so like the,

952
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:41,260
the sort of core anchors of my day or I
play tennis in the morning at usually at

953
00:58:41,261 --> 00:58:45,940
seven, um, and I workout
with my trainer at too.

954
00:58:46,390 --> 00:58:51,280
And just having those two anchors makes
everything goes so much smoother because

955
00:58:51,281 --> 00:58:56,281
then I have a big block in the morning
from eight 30 to one to like write and

956
00:58:58,970 --> 00:59:00,460
manage what else,
where else I have to,

957
00:59:00,461 --> 00:59:04,660
and then after I trained from
like three 30 to six. Um,

958
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:08,450
so I just think that becomes the,
the,

959
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:12,760
the way I manage time is,
and also if you're, you're
fueled by those two workouts,

960
00:59:12,761 --> 00:59:16,120
do you come back like ready to go,
you know, you're just like in it.

961
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:19,150
And so I always feel like I'm,

962
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:23,450
I'm operating like pure
adrenaline at any given time and,

963
00:59:23,451 --> 00:59:27,890
and operating very single
mindedly on something. Um,

964
00:59:28,070 --> 00:59:31,940
and then I tried to finish working by
seven because I also think if you work too

965
00:59:31,941 --> 00:59:35,150
late,
it ruins the work the next day.

966
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:40,520
Are there any particular tools that
you use to help you manage all of this?

967
00:59:41,390 --> 00:59:45,620
Um, this is, I've had fights
with friends over this.

968
00:59:45,621 --> 00:59:49,910
Who Do you think I should use a calendar,
but my, when we were growing up,

969
00:59:49,911 --> 00:59:53,720
my dad never used a calendar for his
business and he just wasn't into it.

970
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:56,480
He just felt like he could
keep everything in his head.

971
00:59:57,020 --> 01:00:00,050
And I don't know is how he grew up.
It's how I grew up.

972
01:00:00,051 --> 01:00:03,800
I never kept track of my homework
in school. I never wrote stuff down.

973
01:00:04,610 --> 01:00:08,390
And so I don't have a calendar,
which is so ridiculous to say out loud,

974
01:00:08,391 --> 01:00:10,490
but I don't have a calendar.
Do you know,

975
01:00:10,491 --> 01:00:14,720
is that a reflection of just having
a prodigious memory or is it more,

976
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:18,860
is it a reflection of it
being more free flowing?

977
01:00:18,861 --> 01:00:21,890
Do you wake up in the morning knowing
exactly what you're going to do in those

978
01:00:21,891 --> 01:00:24,650
two major blocks of time or,
I think that's it.

979
01:00:24,650 --> 01:00:28,880
I think it's because I know the anchors.
I know what's happening. The only thing,

980
01:00:28,881 --> 01:00:33,290
I mean obviously if I have to attend to
scheduling a trip for April or something,

981
01:00:33,291 --> 01:00:36,620
I'll have it written down somewhere.
So let's, let's as an exercise,

982
01:00:36,621 --> 01:00:39,510
so today's Tuesday, today's
your odds and ends day. Yeah.

983
01:00:39,770 --> 01:00:42,650
What does tomorrow look like for you
and what are your key priorities?

984
01:00:42,651 --> 01:00:46,460
If you can talk about them? Yeah. So
tomorrow. Okay. So I'll get up at,

985
01:00:46,461 --> 01:00:50,120
I usually get up about six and
then what do I do in the morning?

986
01:00:50,121 --> 01:00:53,660
So I'll meditate for about 15 minutes.
What type of meditation?

987
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:58,010
How do you meditate? Oh, that's a, that'll
take us down a whole rabbit hole. Okay.

988
01:00:58,011 --> 01:00:59,270
We'll come back to that and I'll,
I'll,

989
01:00:59,271 --> 01:01:04,271
I'll bookmark that a 15
minutes of meditation and
then I start my day everyday

990
01:01:04,431 --> 01:01:05,240
with,
um,

991
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:09,140
I boil water and then I put a towel over
my head and I inhale steam because for

992
01:01:09,141 --> 01:01:11,570
some reason it gets a sweat going.

993
01:01:11,570 --> 01:01:16,490
And somehow clears out my head. I don't
know. It just like something I do, which,

994
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:21,020
which always works and it just feels like
you went to a sauna in your house. Um,

995
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:24,860
and then I'll eat,
uh,

996
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:28,790
grab a juice from the place next
door and then gets a tennis by seven.

997
01:01:29,630 --> 01:01:33,740
I'll get home by eight 30.
I'll be writing by nine.

998
01:01:33,741 --> 01:01:37,730
And then right now I'm working
on revisions to the first
10 chapters of book for,

999
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:42,660
so I'll do that until about
one, then I'll eat. Um,

1000
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:46,130
then I'll go meet my trainer
and we trained from about,

1001
01:01:46,131 --> 01:01:48,680
do you have a set lunch that you have?
Yeah,

1002
01:01:48,681 --> 01:01:51,500
so we were talking about
this before we came on.

1003
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:55,130
I can't cook and I just don't
have time to think about food.

1004
01:01:55,131 --> 01:02:00,131
So I have tried to every meal delivery
service in New York City and um,

1005
01:02:01,220 --> 01:02:04,330
I used the portable chef,
which is really good, uh,

1006
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:08,840
which is basically like a customized
personal shaft and they'd deliver all your

1007
01:02:08,841 --> 01:02:13,400
meals for the day to day before. Got
It. Um, so everything's set for you.

1008
01:02:13,401 --> 01:02:16,940
So that one's really great. Heart and
belly is really good. Um, and it's not,

1009
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,640
it's not like blue apron or something like
that where you have to like have pots,

1010
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:26,280
right. As minimal. So you're, you
heat it up and you're ready to go,

1011
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:29,540
ready to go to then, um,
yeah. Then I'll go train with,

1012
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:33,510
with trainer Dave as I call
him from two to about three 30,

1013
01:02:33,870 --> 01:02:38,870
and then from four to six 30 or seven
is that second block where right now it

1014
01:02:40,201 --> 01:02:44,790
will still be revising. But you know,
inevitably there's business stuff too.

1015
01:02:44,791 --> 01:02:49,620
So I tried to do that, um, in a solid
hour, uh, as well. So that's you.

1016
01:02:49,621 --> 01:02:54,230
And then, because I work in my, on
my apartment most of the time, um,

1017
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:57,990
after seven I leave, I never
am at home. After seven,

1018
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:02,910
I always go out or a do something, see
friends, you know, or go on a bad date.

1019
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:08,220
What are your, what are your favorite
ways to wind down after a day?

1020
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:11,980
Do you have any people?
And it's just, you know,

1021
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,910
the good thing about having lived in
New York for 15 years is, you know,

1022
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,720
I've met so many cool
people and so, um, you know,

1023
01:03:18,721 --> 01:03:23,010
I tried to to go see a show,
go see a movie.

1024
01:03:23,070 --> 01:03:27,240
Inevitably one of my friends, I have a lot
of actor friends were in, in things. So,

1025
01:03:27,660 --> 01:03:30,250
you know, there's all, there's
always something. Yeah.

1026
01:03:31,230 --> 01:03:35,820
Do you have any prebid rituals or
anything that you do typically before bed?

1027
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:41,420
If I really want to sleep well then I'll
stop watching anything by 10 even nine

1028
01:03:42,961 --> 01:03:47,961
30 because I think I'd rather read than
watch TV because for some reason I just

1029
01:03:48,481 --> 01:03:52,050
have a very sort of like open,
spongy brain.

1030
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:54,000
And if I watch TV too close to bed,

1031
01:03:54,270 --> 01:03:58,410
that's what I'm going to dream about
when I'd rather not be dreaming about,

1032
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:02,280
you know, the real housewives
of New York. What do you,

1033
01:04:02,281 --> 01:04:05,880
what are you reading at the moment or
what's the last book that you found

1034
01:04:05,881 --> 01:04:08,130
memorable?
You know,

1035
01:04:08,131 --> 01:04:11,910
I've read this book three times now
and I keep trying to stop rereading it,

1036
01:04:11,911 --> 01:04:15,420
but I think it's maybe the
best book I've ever read. Um,

1037
01:04:15,450 --> 01:04:20,400
called a little life by Hanya Yanagihara
that came out the little life,

1038
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:24,210
a little life, a little life.
Um, it's big. I mean it's,

1039
01:04:24,211 --> 01:04:26,280
it's almost 700 pages.
Um,

1040
01:04:26,580 --> 01:04:31,320
but I think it was nominated for the
Pulitzer or something and it's just

1041
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:33,570
incredible. It's, it's about, you know,

1042
01:04:33,571 --> 01:04:38,220
these four male friends who grow up in
New York City together and it's sort of

1043
01:04:38,221 --> 01:04:41,850
tracking their life from when
they're 20 to 60 and you know,

1044
01:04:41,851 --> 01:04:43,470
for p for anybody who,

1045
01:04:43,770 --> 01:04:48,240
who loves to have a bigger view of what
life is and look beyond sort of the,

1046
01:04:48,870 --> 01:04:53,220
again, the Matrix of what life is supposed
to look like according to society,

1047
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:57,630
that book will just completely
sort of ravage your brain.

1048
01:04:57,920 --> 01:04:59,400
And so I just think it's,

1049
01:04:59,730 --> 01:05:04,320
I give it to so many people and never
once has anyone come back to me and not

1050
01:05:04,321 --> 01:05:09,070
said like, that changed my life. You know?
I think that might be the title of a,

1051
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:11,420
of this podcast, episode ravage, Ravenous,

1052
01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:14,840
ravaging your brain for
how much was so much. Uh,

1053
01:05:15,610 --> 01:05:19,840
so a few things.
The first is meditation.

1054
01:05:20,110 --> 01:05:24,490
What type of meditation? So,
or describe your meditation.

1055
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:30,100
It, it's super simple. It's just
going to sound a little crazy. Um,

1056
01:05:30,190 --> 01:05:33,080
terribly long. Cause I've been
doing this for a long time. Like I,

1057
01:05:33,370 --> 01:05:38,260
I remember I read the Tao Te Ching when
I was 23 or 24 and going through a rough

1058
01:05:38,261 --> 01:05:41,500
time after the movie had collapsed
or maybe it was a little later,

1059
01:05:41,780 --> 01:05:45,340
a copy of it also six inches
from my left thigh. Okay.

1060
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:50,290
And I remember reading it being like,
okay, this makes no sense, you know,

1061
01:05:50,291 --> 01:05:53,740
but you just keep reading
it again and again.

1062
01:05:53,740 --> 01:05:57,640
And slowly I started to get the point of
it, which was thank God I played tennis,

1063
01:05:57,820 --> 01:06:00,400
but it was saying the same thing that
I talked to you about tennis earlier,

1064
01:06:00,401 --> 01:06:04,240
which is there should not be any
decisions. It should be automatic.

1065
01:06:04,270 --> 01:06:06,940
It's not automatic because
there is something in the way.

1066
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:11,320
And the thing in your way is the I
the ego, your self consciousness.

1067
01:06:11,530 --> 01:06:14,950
So every meditation I've done since then,
and it's not been 10 years,

1068
01:06:15,190 --> 01:06:18,280
it's 15 minutes of trying to find the eye.

1069
01:06:18,310 --> 01:06:22,480
That sort of energy that makes
up that conscious will, you know,

1070
01:06:22,481 --> 01:06:27,040
inside of me and realizing that that's
actually the place that you do not want

1071
01:06:27,041 --> 01:06:29,890
to operate from that that is
actually an illusion, right?

1072
01:06:29,891 --> 01:06:34,150
That's just residual anger and frustration
and your inability to control things

1073
01:06:34,151 --> 01:06:37,290
in the world. Right? So
all of my meditation is,

1074
01:06:37,291 --> 01:06:41,770
is recognizing the eye that you operate
from and the world tells you to operate

1075
01:06:41,771 --> 01:06:45,220
from. And realizing that that's
what you have to let go of.

1076
01:06:45,580 --> 01:06:49,960
So when you sit down, assuming
you're sitting, are you,

1077
01:06:49,961 --> 01:06:54,640
then I'd like you to get as
concrete as you can describe it.

1078
01:06:54,641 --> 01:06:59,320
Are you imagining the me,
so to speak, in parentheses,

1079
01:06:59,321 --> 01:07:04,321
behind the sitting behind the eyes and
trying to visually or graphically observe

1080
01:07:05,891 --> 01:07:06,400
it?
Are you,

1081
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:11,290
are you observing the words in your
head as a detached third party?

1082
01:07:11,291 --> 01:07:16,090
What are you doing exactly? It's more
like trying to sense the me, right?

1083
01:07:16,091 --> 01:07:19,090
Just sort of thinking,
okay, where is I, where,

1084
01:07:19,091 --> 01:07:21,670
where is I in my body right now?
Right?

1085
01:07:21,671 --> 01:07:25,360
And trying to actually imagine
like your entire perception,

1086
01:07:25,361 --> 01:07:28,480
your entire consciousness,
everything that's in your mind,

1087
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:29,890
everything that's in your body,

1088
01:07:29,891 --> 01:07:32,620
everything that's in your
thoughts right now is that I,

1089
01:07:32,621 --> 01:07:37,060
and realizing that all of it is
actually wrong, right? All of it is,

1090
01:07:37,570 --> 01:07:41,150
is energy that you're holding
that needs to be let go of. Um,

1091
01:07:41,590 --> 01:07:43,300
and what you really want is empty space.

1092
01:07:43,301 --> 01:07:47,140
I think that the line and the top
stitching that stuck with me the most is,

1093
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:50,830
you know, why is there something
when there should be nothing. Right?

1094
01:07:50,890 --> 01:07:55,570
And it's that whole idea of,
of the true happy human is clear.

1095
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:59,260
There shouldn't be anything there. Um,
and so that's what the meditation is.

1096
01:07:59,261 --> 01:08:02,710
It's trying to find the bi,
the,

1097
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:05,440
that center of like me. Like, you know,

1098
01:08:05,441 --> 01:08:08,650
I can I actually identify what the
me is and then realizing that that's,

1099
01:08:09,010 --> 01:08:13,930
that needs to be let go. So
you're, you're very self directed,

1100
01:08:14,470 --> 01:08:16,070
even lacking.
So

1101
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:19,430
you are, I hope you have, I hope that
the studio has good key man. Insurance.

1102
01:08:19,431 --> 01:08:23,030
Would be, uh, it's, it's a
great point of leverage though,

1103
01:08:23,031 --> 01:08:26,840
having this entire world you've
created inside your own head. Uh,

1104
01:08:26,870 --> 01:08:28,160
not without its risks,
but

1105
01:08:29,750 --> 01:08:32,730
you mentioned having a trainer now,
uh,

1106
01:08:33,470 --> 01:08:35,840
in doing some of my review before this,

1107
01:08:35,870 --> 01:08:40,690
you appear to train exclusively with
trainers. I am almost the opposite. Uh,

1108
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:45,380
said lift to your why that is. Wait
first, tell me why you're the opposite.

1109
01:08:46,130 --> 01:08:51,030
I am, uh, no, it's, it's,
it's not entirely, uh,

1110
01:08:51,380 --> 01:08:53,980
it's changed a bit in the
last few years when I've, uh,

1111
01:08:55,460 --> 01:09:00,460
I've realized that there are certain
types of physical movement that I view as

1112
01:09:01,341 --> 01:09:05,660
recreation, physical recreation,
not primarily training.

1113
01:09:05,810 --> 01:09:10,130
So I'm not doing them to lose body fat
or fill in the blank like acro Yoga,

1114
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:13,700
acrobatic yoga partner,
gymnastics, that type of thing. Uh,

1115
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:18,320
and there are certain instances where
you need a technical coach tennis,

1116
01:09:18,860 --> 01:09:22,970
a gymnastic strength training. In those
instances I will have a coach, uh,

1117
01:09:22,971 --> 01:09:26,210
whether I'm using video or otherwise.
But training for me,

1118
01:09:26,211 --> 01:09:29,300
exercise has always been my me time,

1119
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:34,360
my meditative time to live in the present
moment and very often use some type of

1120
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:39,200
cadence as um, as a, I never
thought of it this way,

1121
01:09:39,201 --> 01:09:41,030
doing this up until maybe a few years ago,

1122
01:09:41,031 --> 01:09:43,760
but a mantra of sorts
where I'm simply counting,

1123
01:09:43,761 --> 01:09:47,600
say the second sub seconds down from
particular lift or the number of

1124
01:09:47,601 --> 01:09:50,630
repetitions.
And that for me is my,

1125
01:09:50,750 --> 01:09:54,330
my mental palate cleanser for
the day. It's, it's, uh, for,

1126
01:09:54,350 --> 01:09:58,280
for a very long time was my
version and a sense of meditation.

1127
01:09:58,281 --> 01:10:01,310
So I didn't want to
banter with someone else.

1128
01:10:01,311 --> 01:10:06,311
I didn't want to have any type of
sensory input from someone else.

1129
01:10:06,490 --> 01:10:10,790
And so that's why, that's why I
trained by myself. Uh, that's,

1130
01:10:11,390 --> 01:10:16,310
that's still the case with
a say a weightlifting, uh,

1131
01:10:16,340 --> 01:10:17,121
in less.

1132
01:10:17,121 --> 01:10:21,260
It is a very technical skill and I'm
working with someone for say an Olympic

1133
01:10:21,261 --> 01:10:25,190
weightlifting movement where the penalty
of doing it incorrectly, so high end,

1134
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:27,010
you really require a set,

1135
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:30,500
a separate set of eyes to correct
because what you think you're doing is

1136
01:10:30,501 --> 01:10:33,590
probably not what you're doing at
least in the beginning. So that's,

1137
01:10:33,710 --> 01:10:35,960
that's why I've,
I've always trained alone end.

1138
01:10:35,961 --> 01:10:40,961
I like to train late so I love
to train at nine 10:11 PM for a,

1139
01:10:44,271 --> 01:10:48,110
for a host of reasons. But
uh, I have a theory though.

1140
01:10:48,140 --> 01:10:53,140
I think that you might instinctively
be what I call a somatic person,

1141
01:10:53,361 --> 01:10:57,050
which is like you,
when it comes to anything in the body,

1142
01:10:57,290 --> 01:10:58,700
you want to push yourself,
right?

1143
01:10:58,701 --> 01:11:03,350
So you won't let yourself get
away with incorrect form or,

1144
01:11:03,740 --> 01:11:07,430
or not pushing yourself to the Max. Yeah,
let's do that word that that's true.

1145
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:09,350
That is true.
Which is not the,

1146
01:11:09,530 --> 01:11:13,980
which is like mentally when I'm working
on a book or something, I will die to

1147
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:17,190
make sure it's perfect. Right. To make
sure that it's, it's exactly right.

1148
01:11:17,191 --> 01:11:21,000
But when I get to a workout,
my instinctive thing just cause I grew up,

1149
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:23,490
then I grew up like,
you know,

1150
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:25,920
the kid who never thought he
was ever going to be strong,

1151
01:11:25,921 --> 01:11:28,950
who kids always made fun of for
being skinny. So when it came to,

1152
01:11:28,990 --> 01:11:32,580
to lifting weights and things like
that, I came in scared. Right.

1153
01:11:32,581 --> 01:11:37,500
And I always bailed before it ever
got heavy thinking. Like, you know,

1154
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:43,110
I'm too weak to do this or whatever
I needed. I need trainers to push me.

1155
01:11:43,460 --> 01:11:43,590
You,

1156
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:46,920
I mean at some level like I need them to
say this is what you're doing and we're

1157
01:11:46,921 --> 01:11:51,150
not getting out of it, you know? Right.
And I think, cause if it was just me,

1158
01:11:52,230 --> 01:11:56,490
I don't know, I would, I don't think it
would be the same. And I also think like,

1159
01:11:57,110 --> 01:12:01,560
it, it let's me not have one, it
lets me have one moment of the day,

1160
01:12:01,710 --> 01:12:06,690
what I'm not in charge, which is nice.
Right, right, right, right, right.

1161
01:12:06,691 --> 01:12:08,260
This makes a lot of
sense. Yeah. This good.

1162
01:12:08,690 --> 01:12:13,690
This could lead into all sorts
of relationship discussions
are interesting thing.

1163
01:12:14,100 --> 01:12:16,300
But, um, the, uh,

1164
01:12:16,350 --> 01:12:18,970
how many trainers have you worked with
or is it always the same person or a

1165
01:12:18,980 --> 01:12:23,790
handful of people? So I work with
the same trainer in, in New York,

1166
01:12:23,791 --> 01:12:25,440
treader Dave trainer,
Dave,

1167
01:12:25,441 --> 01:12:28,650
his name is Dave Stock Zyl at
Crossfit Nyc and I chose him,

1168
01:12:28,770 --> 01:12:30,390
the same ones you got to get a lot busier.

1169
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:35,490
He is an absolute genius and I chose
him the same way I chose my agent,

1170
01:12:35,550 --> 01:12:40,190
which you're going to laugh at, but
I chose them both by their photo. Um,

1171
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:44,490
and I think it's because I spent so much
time casting movies that I'm very good

1172
01:12:44,491 --> 01:12:48,540
at at just when I see a photo or maybe
I spent too much time on Tinder or

1173
01:12:48,541 --> 01:12:49,311
something.
But like I,

1174
01:12:49,311 --> 01:12:54,180
I know when I see a photo
that like that's the person.

1175
01:12:54,510 --> 01:12:57,660
And so I remember going through all
the crossfit gyms in New York and like

1176
01:12:57,661 --> 01:12:59,970
looking at photos and
I saw his and was like,

1177
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:03,960
that's the right guy and
I have to pause here.

1178
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:09,210
So what can you, is this purely
subconscious or is there some,

1179
01:13:09,930 --> 01:13:14,610
is is what you do a teachable skill?
Do you think? No, I think it's,

1180
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:17,850
I think it's instinct. It's, it's,
it's a, I'm looking for with trainers.

1181
01:13:17,851 --> 01:13:22,620
I was looking for like a, a softness
kind of like a kind eyes type of thing.

1182
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:24,330
Yeah.
Like a non bro Bro.

1183
01:13:27,270 --> 01:13:31,350
Right, right. Yes I do.
And, and that's him. He's,

1184
01:13:31,351 --> 01:13:35,040
he's the guy you go to if, um, you know,

1185
01:13:35,041 --> 01:13:39,270
you aren't like if you,

1186
01:13:39,350 --> 01:13:43,840
if you're coming at weight training, not
from like the bro his place, you know,

1187
01:13:44,460 --> 01:13:49,230
what do you do when you're on the road?
Then I get a trainer every single city,

1188
01:13:49,231 --> 01:13:53,160
every single day I'm in. It's a,
it's a bit obsessive. But how do you,

1189
01:13:53,190 --> 01:13:57,330
how do you find them and how do you choose
or are they all photograph based? No,

1190
01:13:57,331 --> 01:14:02,160
no, no. That's too much work. So that
the assistant, does she, she knows,

1191
01:14:02,161 --> 01:14:04,680
um, you know, I don't know. She just,

1192
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:09,120
she's pretty good at knowing
what to look for now because, um,

1193
01:14:09,150 --> 01:14:11,620
I've been on enough tours that
I'll be like, that one was great.

1194
01:14:11,621 --> 01:14:16,150
That one wasn't that great. So she,
she started to get a sense of like,

1195
01:14:16,151 --> 01:14:19,390
you know what I'm looking for, but
I've worked with, you know, so many,

1196
01:14:19,391 --> 01:14:21,550
so many different trainings. Uh, trainers.

1197
01:14:21,551 --> 01:14:26,551
I think what makes Dave so great is he
figured out very early on that it wasn't

1198
01:14:27,781 --> 01:14:31,650
just going to be crossfit that I needed,
but he's mixed in a ton of GSD stuff,

1199
01:14:31,651 --> 01:14:35,350
which is the gymnastic strength
training. Um, a lot of z health stuff,

1200
01:14:35,351 --> 01:14:39,560
which is like exercises that also
compliment like brain neurology.

1201
01:14:39,890 --> 01:14:44,200
Like he's very good at customizing
based on your personality, what,

1202
01:14:44,310 --> 01:14:45,560
what your goal is.
Like,

1203
01:14:45,561 --> 01:14:50,240
he knows not to give me intense
conditioning pieces cause I can out cardio

1204
01:14:50,241 --> 01:14:53,470
anyone on the planet, you know, I
mean it's just the way I was born.

1205
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:57,030
So he's focusing on, on
my weaknesses, you know.

1206
01:14:57,410 --> 01:14:58,980
Got It.
All right,

1207
01:14:59,010 --> 01:15:02,420
well I'm not going to spend too much
time on trainers cause there's so many

1208
01:15:02,630 --> 01:15:06,080
other places I want to dig quarters,
million dollars in debt.

1209
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:11,030
That's a fuck ton of money, uh,
after Undergrad and, uh, the MFA.

1210
01:15:11,210 --> 01:15:16,210
So how did you and your family make
the decision to go so far into debt?

1211
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:20,750
Because in the u s there's a very,

1212
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:25,550
and I think this is dangerous
on a lot of levels and anti,

1213
01:15:26,060 --> 01:15:30,140
at least in Silicon Valley, there's a very
romanticized anti college notion. Yeah.

1214
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:34,450
And I do think that student debt can be a,

1215
01:15:34,810 --> 01:15:38,360
a paralyzing problem for many people.
How did you decide to go?

1216
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:40,910
How did you and your family
decided to go that far into debt?

1217
01:15:41,060 --> 01:15:43,190
And I don't know if it was
you or you and your family.

1218
01:15:43,191 --> 01:15:46,370
I don't know how that was arranged.
I think, you know, at some level

1219
01:15:47,350 --> 01:15:51,200
Indian families are,
are a lot like Jewish families and,

1220
01:15:51,201 --> 01:15:53,210
and other sort of,
you know,

1221
01:15:54,270 --> 01:15:59,080
cultures that put a primacy on education
where there is this expectation that

1222
01:15:59,081 --> 01:16:01,960
your family, we'll pay for school. Um,

1223
01:16:02,670 --> 01:16:07,190
and my dad was going through
a hard time in, in the 80s,

1224
01:16:07,260 --> 01:16:09,500
um, you know, cause he was in
real estate and that's when,

1225
01:16:09,501 --> 01:16:12,050
when the market was tanking and you know,

1226
01:16:12,051 --> 01:16:16,600
he took on a lot of debt himself
in order to, to pay for Harvard.

1227
01:16:16,601 --> 01:16:19,280
So I don't think Harvard is where
the main source of debt came from.

1228
01:16:19,770 --> 01:16:22,900
Main source of debt came from
film school and you know,

1229
01:16:22,950 --> 01:16:26,600
there was no way he was going to pay
for that or I was going to let him. Um,

1230
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:29,480
and so it was just yes,

1231
01:16:29,660 --> 01:16:32,800
my decision really to basically be like,
okay,

1232
01:16:33,710 --> 01:16:37,490
I was so diluted I guess into thinking
that like somehow I was going to pay it

1233
01:16:37,491 --> 01:16:41,750
back. Um, and I look at some of the
kids who came out of film school and,

1234
01:16:41,780 --> 01:16:45,920
and are saddled with so much that now and
I just don't know what you do. Like I,

1235
01:16:46,180 --> 01:16:49,980
I was lucky enough to discover tutoring,
which paid really,

1236
01:16:49,981 --> 01:16:53,470
really well and I was lucky to get a
ton of clients and do really well at it.

1237
01:16:53,471 --> 01:16:57,180
So that's what got me through
and ultimately the book
deal help me. So, you know,

1238
01:16:57,190 --> 01:17:01,290
sort of pay the rest off,
but mmm. It is gamble.

1239
01:17:01,291 --> 01:17:02,970
That is not wise I think.

1240
01:17:03,410 --> 01:17:05,220
Okay. All right. So, so now,

1241
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:10,040
now we're getting to the next
question, which is advice. So

1242
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:14,630
much like college has a sort of
lost its luster for a lot of people.

1243
01:17:15,170 --> 01:17:16,090
Although I,

1244
01:17:16,310 --> 01:17:20,450
I do generally think that if you can
get into a top tier name recognizable

1245
01:17:21,230 --> 01:17:25,100
brand, which sounds terrible, but
whether it's Undergrad or say Mba,

1246
01:17:25,101 --> 01:17:27,870
then it can be worth it.
Sometimes. I agree with you.

1247
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:32,480
The film, the MFA Film School, uh,

1248
01:17:32,510 --> 01:17:35,170
is also one of those um,

1249
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:40,430
divisive topics where a lot of successful
filmmakers will say waste of time.

1250
01:17:40,580 --> 01:17:43,550
But then there are many successful
filmmakers who come out of film school,

1251
01:17:45,710 --> 01:17:48,350
aspiring filmmaker,
uh,

1252
01:17:48,351 --> 01:17:52,190
about to graduate from Undergrad or
has already graduated from Undergrad,

1253
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:56,180
did decently well in however
we want to think about that.

1254
01:17:57,740 --> 01:18:00,200
Should I go to film school?
They love film.

1255
01:18:00,980 --> 01:18:05,980
Maybe they've done a few short films
in some elective classes in college,

1256
01:18:06,350 --> 01:18:09,200
but their major or something else.
Should I go to film school?

1257
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:12,320
What do you say to that person or what
do you ask them? What's the conversation?

1258
01:18:12,860 --> 01:18:17,790
What would I say now? I would have such
specific advice now, which is only gay,

1259
01:18:17,870 --> 01:18:22,010
go to film school. If you can get
into USC, that would be my only,

1260
01:18:22,340 --> 01:18:23,210
my only advice.

1261
01:18:23,211 --> 01:18:27,560
And the reason why is the industry has
changed so much to basically eliminate

1262
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:32,620
independent film so that the only sort
of productive education you're going to

1263
01:18:33,980 --> 01:18:38,120
get in film school that will
lead you to, you know, uh,

1264
01:18:38,121 --> 01:18:43,100
Hollywood career at some level is to be
in southern California at USC. You know,

1265
01:18:43,101 --> 01:18:46,940
maybe Ucla where you have studio
connections and are working with studio

1266
01:18:46,941 --> 01:18:51,230
professors. And if you're good enough
you're going to get, um, you know,

1267
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:54,980
you might get seen. That's what I would
say. Cause when I went to Columbia,

1268
01:18:54,981 --> 01:18:57,590
it was in the heyday of the,

1269
01:18:57,650 --> 01:19:00,170
of independent film at some level.

1270
01:19:00,171 --> 01:19:04,310
And so a lot of the great things that
happened to me at Columbia where,

1271
01:19:04,311 --> 01:19:08,300
because I had access to all
these successful, you know,

1272
01:19:08,510 --> 01:19:12,920
independent directors and producers who
love my work and therefore introduced me

1273
01:19:12,921 --> 01:19:17,360
to all these great people who all those
people now are having trouble making

1274
01:19:17,361 --> 01:19:21,170
films of course, because there's
no outlet for them, you know,

1275
01:19:21,470 --> 01:19:25,700
so they've all gone to television
or whatever. So film at some level,

1276
01:19:25,701 --> 01:19:28,990
if you want to work in film, we're
talking working, you know, in,

1277
01:19:28,991 --> 01:19:32,450
in the studio world,
which means you gotta be in La,

1278
01:19:32,540 --> 01:19:37,190
you have to get to be at one of those
two schools. But otherwise I would say,

1279
01:19:38,270 --> 01:19:40,250
I don't think there's a need for it.
I don't think,

1280
01:19:40,251 --> 01:19:43,400
I don't think you need to
go to film school. I think
you just need to make work.

1281
01:19:44,030 --> 01:19:48,890
Yup.
This is the USC reference or,

1282
01:19:48,980 --> 01:19:53,620
or I guess a recommendation with caveats.
Uh,

1283
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:58,730
makes me think of Stanford also in
my backyard here in the bay area and

1284
01:19:58,731 --> 01:20:02,620
certainly as a compute, as a
competent computer science major, the,

1285
01:20:02,670 --> 01:20:06,260
the demand for engineers
so outstrips supply. It's,

1286
01:20:06,261 --> 01:20:08,100
it's just ludicrous.

1287
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:12,780
But if you want to be part of the Silicon
Valley tech scene and you're debating

1288
01:20:12,781 --> 01:20:17,781
between different undergrad options than
silicon valley and being based in Palo

1289
01:20:21,340 --> 01:20:24,960
Alto where you have all of the venture
capitalists literally in the same town or

1290
01:20:24,961 --> 01:20:29,760
right next door, uh, gives you a, can
give you a huge leg up. Similarly,

1291
01:20:29,761 --> 01:20:32,310
depending on which facet of the
business you want to be a part of.

1292
01:20:32,790 --> 01:20:35,660
It was the one school
that I didn't let my uh,

1293
01:20:35,740 --> 01:20:38,730
well cause I helped so many kids with
their college applications over the years.

1294
01:20:38,910 --> 01:20:43,290
Stanford was the one school I rarely,
rarely kind of let them apply to.

1295
01:20:43,470 --> 01:20:46,330
Why is that? As I, I said
it was too hard. I said art,

1296
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:49,200
I said the problem with
Stanford is that you have to,

1297
01:20:49,230 --> 01:20:53,790
the college application game
is very simple. Whichever
school you apply to early,

1298
01:20:54,180 --> 01:20:59,180
you better be fairly sure you have a
good shot at getting in because you know

1299
01:20:59,431 --> 01:21:02,640
when you apply early, um, your
chances of getting in are much better.

1300
01:21:03,150 --> 01:21:06,420
But you have to at least
be in the game to get in.

1301
01:21:06,810 --> 01:21:11,810
Stanford's acceptance rate is so low
and everybody applying to Stanford is so

1302
01:21:12,391 --> 01:21:16,920
good and so smart that to get
in it takes an act of God.

1303
01:21:16,980 --> 01:21:20,700
You better be like, you
know, a real miracle nature.

1304
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:24,630
And so it was the one school I
recommended more often than not,

1305
01:21:24,631 --> 01:21:28,740
I just said you are throwing away your
application because they don't take

1306
01:21:28,741 --> 01:21:33,690
anyone. It's harder than Harvard is
Harvard then, then Yale, it's harbor.

1307
01:21:33,691 --> 01:21:36,260
Then any school. Stanford is, to me,

1308
01:21:36,270 --> 01:21:39,180
Stanford's is a top school in the
country right now. It's a great school.

1309
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:40,560
It's a great school. If their, uh,

1310
01:21:40,620 --> 01:21:44,850
their business school programs is also
outstanding. I considered it. I had this,

1311
01:21:45,550 --> 01:21:50,310
I, I always thought I should have gone
to Stanford had I been able to get in.

1312
01:21:50,311 --> 01:21:54,210
I mean I applied early to Princeton,
got accepted,

1313
01:21:54,211 --> 01:21:57,300
ended up having a very difficult time
at Princeton. Always thought, you know,

1314
01:21:57,301 --> 01:22:01,470
I would have been much better off having
gone to a brown or a Stanford. Yeah.

1315
01:22:01,471 --> 01:22:06,030
Cause you're, you're not at Princeton
is very square. Yeah. And I ended up,

1316
01:22:06,060 --> 01:22:08,790
uh, I don't know if I've ever talked
about this publicly. I ended up,

1317
01:22:08,791 --> 01:22:13,500
I don't know if you're familiar with
the very weird eating club. Absolutely.

1318
01:22:13,860 --> 01:22:15,780
Social structure at Princeton,

1319
01:22:15,781 --> 01:22:19,270
but in effect for people who aren't
familiar with this, you have the,

1320
01:22:19,300 --> 01:22:20,133
you have a street.

1321
01:22:20,260 --> 01:22:25,260
If you have a street that is lined with
gigantic mansions and that is where the

1322
01:22:26,671 --> 01:22:31,170
partying happens generally welcome to
Princeton, Princeton, gigantic mansions.

1323
01:22:31,171 --> 01:22:35,910
They're all stylistically different, which
is very odd, so you have kind of old,

1324
01:22:35,911 --> 01:22:40,110
tiny blue blood,
New England rich mansion.

1325
01:22:40,111 --> 01:22:45,111
Then you'll have colonial style going to
Georgia bell from old money mansion and

1326
01:22:46,681 --> 01:22:47,830
then it goes on and on.

1327
01:22:48,030 --> 01:22:53,030
It's a very odd place and they're
effectively coed fraternities.

1328
01:22:53,401 --> 01:22:58,401
It's easiest way to describe it where
you also eat meals and some of these

1329
01:22:59,221 --> 01:23:03,390
eating clubs, it's just
mindblowing. Like Ivy for instance,

1330
01:23:03,391 --> 01:23:06,190
I believe has an endowment so to speak,

1331
01:23:06,460 --> 01:23:11,080
that is larger than some name brand
universities in the United States.

1332
01:23:11,110 --> 01:23:13,150
It's just mind blowing end.

1333
01:23:13,270 --> 01:23:18,270
I ended up trying to fit in in some
of these eating clubs and getting very

1334
01:23:19,181 --> 01:23:23,890
disillusioned and unhappy and then
joining an eating club called terrorists.

1335
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:26,530
So terrorists,
to give you an idea,

1336
01:23:26,531 --> 01:23:30,880
had a rainbow flag flying out
front. I am. I would have loved it.

1337
01:23:30,910 --> 01:23:34,270
I am not gay, but it's where all the,
it's basically like your Tuesday.

1338
01:23:34,510 --> 01:23:36,760
It's where the,
it's where the odds and ends,

1339
01:23:37,210 --> 01:23:40,270
the people who didn't fit in
anywhere else ended up going.

1340
01:23:40,450 --> 01:23:41,920
And it was the one thing,

1341
01:23:41,950 --> 01:23:46,180
I don't give any money to Princeton for
reasons that you guys can look up if

1342
01:23:46,181 --> 01:23:47,650
you're, if you want to read, uh,

1343
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:51,090
some practical thoughts on suicide
and essay that I wrote, then a,

1344
01:23:51,110 --> 01:23:52,980
that'll give you an idea why
don't give money to Princeton,

1345
01:23:52,981 --> 01:23:57,370
but I do give money to terrorists
because it's saved me. Um, anyway,

1346
01:23:57,371 --> 01:24:00,990
I'm not sure how we, how I got onto
that, but I didn't, I didn't fit in,

1347
01:24:00,991 --> 01:24:05,500
in any way at Princeton whatsoever
because I think most of your listeners at

1348
01:24:05,501 --> 01:24:10,120
some level, regardless of, you know,
whether on the outside they fit in or not,

1349
01:24:10,121 --> 01:24:13,210
I think inside they don't, which is why
they're looking for something different.

1350
01:24:13,240 --> 01:24:16,040
And that's also why I wrote the
books. Right? I felt like, you know,

1351
01:24:16,090 --> 01:24:19,090
when I was growing up, there were no
books for the odds and ends right there.

1352
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:22,390
The hero always won.
It was always the good looking guy.

1353
01:24:22,391 --> 01:24:25,930
Like even if you read Harry Potter,
like he's always the good kid.

1354
01:24:25,931 --> 01:24:27,430
He always does the right thing,
you know,

1355
01:24:27,431 --> 01:24:31,200
he's going to win at the end because
there's no version of potter where Harry

1356
01:24:31,210 --> 01:24:34,720
ends up in a pool of blood and
Voldemort goes kicking into the sunset.

1357
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:39,880
And I've wanted to write
a book that questioned all
those assumptions, you know,

1358
01:24:39,890 --> 01:24:42,640
in some level and said,
okay, what about us?

1359
01:24:42,641 --> 01:24:47,230
What about us Weirdos who root for the
villains or are US Weirdos who don't

1360
01:24:47,231 --> 01:24:51,250
think evil is what evil is made out to
be and that good often is not good and

1361
01:24:51,630 --> 01:24:55,810
you know, all those sort of sort
of big questions. So, um, yeah,

1362
01:24:55,811 --> 01:24:59,250
it's why I think I've always
been attracted to your work and,

1363
01:24:59,251 --> 01:25:02,560
and people like you at
some levels because um,

1364
01:25:03,220 --> 01:25:08,220
that sort of questioning reality of what
the structure is is so important and I

1365
01:25:08,981 --> 01:25:10,850
think kids are helpless to do that.
And,

1366
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:13,780
and if we can train them
not to through books,

1367
01:25:13,781 --> 01:25:17,850
cause that's our number one medium to
sort of get to them. Um, I think it's,

1368
01:25:17,851 --> 01:25:21,850
it's a big deal, which is why I sort of
take what I do. Like I said too seriously,

1369
01:25:21,851 --> 01:25:26,260
probably. I mean, I think that anyone
who's really good at what they do really,

1370
01:25:26,261 --> 01:25:28,450
really good,
tends to have a

1371
01:25:29,980 --> 01:25:34,570
certain degree of pathological
obsession with, with what they do.

1372
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:37,240
If you had to recommend

1373
01:25:39,910 --> 01:25:44,020
books on writing or books that
would help someone's writing,

1374
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:48,580
um, is there, is there a shortlist?
Are there any of that come to mind?

1375
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:52,240
Let me think. I think, and I'm
not gonna, I'm not gonna make it.

1376
01:25:52,241 --> 01:25:55,810
John was specific on purpose. It could
be, it could be anything. For instance,

1377
01:25:55,811 --> 01:25:59,230
I'm a nonfiction writer at this point,
but bird by bird,

1378
01:25:59,231 --> 01:26:02,650
which is written and Lamar
for fiction writers really,

1379
01:26:02,651 --> 01:26:07,410
I found just the best, the cheapest
therapy that money could buy. Yup. Yup.

1380
01:26:07,470 --> 01:26:11,320
Yup. That's, that one's an
amazing book. I think, you know,

1381
01:26:11,450 --> 01:26:16,450
I'm less interested in books specifically
about writing because I think writing

1382
01:26:17,481 --> 01:26:21,230
to me is like breathing you right,
the way you breathe.

1383
01:26:21,380 --> 01:26:24,560
Everybody has their own way of
doing it. Everyone, you know,

1384
01:26:24,561 --> 01:26:27,830
every true writer has to write to
stay alive because that's how we,

1385
01:26:28,430 --> 01:26:33,080
that's how we live, you know,
that's, that's our connection
to the sort of cosmos.

1386
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:37,190
And so every writer has their,
their specific process.

1387
01:26:37,191 --> 01:26:41,720
I don't get so much out of a
writer books what I do get books,

1388
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:46,840
you know, out of our two things, one
books about creativity and then, you know,

1389
01:26:46,850 --> 01:26:51,850
sort of like creative spirit and then
documentaries about creative process.

1390
01:26:52,390 --> 01:26:54,560
Those are the two things
I sort of look at.

1391
01:26:54,590 --> 01:26:58,160
And so one of my favorite
books is called the spark. Um,

1392
01:26:58,460 --> 01:27:03,430
it was written by Cirque du Solei about,
very cool. I love Cirque de Solei. Um,

1393
01:27:03,470 --> 01:27:06,410
and they have a book called the spark
about where their ideas come from.

1394
01:27:06,650 --> 01:27:10,200
It's very short, you can read
it in like 20 minutes. Um,

1395
01:27:10,640 --> 01:27:15,640
but it's fantastic and it gets to this
idea that so much of creativity is about

1396
01:27:16,461 --> 01:27:19,640
the fact that we try to
control it. Right? That again,

1397
01:27:19,641 --> 01:27:23,150
it goes back to that idea of the eye
that I'm trying to get rid of that if we

1398
01:27:23,151 --> 01:27:24,580
just let go of this idea of,

1399
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:29,420
of the conscious I trying to control
when we work creativity and create to

1400
01:27:29,450 --> 01:27:30,230
creatively,

1401
01:27:30,230 --> 01:27:33,230
that's when the universe comes rushing
through and it's so it's about almost

1402
01:27:33,231 --> 01:27:37,820
making yourself into a clear vessel and
accepting that that you know it's going

1403
01:27:37,821 --> 01:27:38,420
to come.

1404
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:43,250
And I think one of the great things about
writing a series is that now that I'm

1405
01:27:43,251 --> 01:27:47,750
on book four and I've settled into
a rhythm, I start to trust myself.

1406
01:27:47,751 --> 01:27:50,690
And when I trust myself is when the
great stuff happens because I'm not

1407
01:27:50,691 --> 01:27:54,830
monitoring, I'm not judging.
And when you're not editing,

1408
01:27:54,831 --> 01:27:56,720
when you're generating editing
and you're getting twit,

1409
01:27:56,750 --> 01:28:01,250
I'm getting twist after twist where every
chapter is ending in a twist that like

1410
01:28:01,251 --> 01:28:04,340
I never predicted the characters doing
something I'd never had any idea they

1411
01:28:04,341 --> 01:28:07,510
would do. And it's happening versus
you know, the first couple of books,

1412
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:10,430
first three books where it's, you know,
every chapter, one twist or whatever.

1413
01:28:10,431 --> 01:28:12,290
Now it's constantly,
constantly, constantly,

1414
01:28:12,291 --> 01:28:16,710
because I'm allowing myself to take
things in new directions. And uh,

1415
01:28:16,720 --> 01:28:20,540
along with the spark, um, they've
got a cool documentary called,

1416
01:28:20,990 --> 01:28:23,300
I think it's called the fire
within, that follows, um,

1417
01:28:24,020 --> 01:28:27,930
eight people that try out for
Cirque du Solei. And it's sort of a,

1418
01:28:28,330 --> 01:28:33,000
it's kind of a wonderful Canadian
documentary about, um, just, you know,

1419
01:28:33,020 --> 01:28:35,360
people passionate about their heart.
Um,

1420
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:38,450
and then the other thing is I'm obsessed
with a documentary is about creative

1421
01:28:38,451 --> 01:28:42,200
process,
specifically about fashion designers.

1422
01:28:42,201 --> 01:28:44,240
Because if you look at fashion,

1423
01:28:44,270 --> 01:28:48,390
it's where you get 100% under diluted,
uh,

1424
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:51,710
creativity because it's on such a short
cycle with all the different fashion

1425
01:28:51,711 --> 01:28:56,570
shows. And so it's also in a sense, I
mean purely subjective, which makes it,

1426
01:28:57,050 --> 01:29:01,160
which adds to the creativity by
necessity in some respects. Yes.

1427
01:29:01,170 --> 01:29:06,170
And so you get to sort of watch these
madcap geniuses who aren't constrained,

1428
01:29:07,590 --> 01:29:08,281
right?
Because again,

1429
01:29:08,281 --> 01:29:10,860
it's subjective so they can do whatever
they want because people have already

1430
01:29:10,861 --> 01:29:14,900
judged them to be geniuses at some level.
So you, you get these amazing things.

1431
01:29:14,901 --> 01:29:17,910
So you know,
things like Dior and I or Valentino,

1432
01:29:17,911 --> 01:29:22,030
the last emperor or Lagerfeld
confidential. Um, if you,

1433
01:29:22,230 --> 01:29:26,120
if you had to pick one of those
three for a non fashion, I'm,

1434
01:29:26,170 --> 01:29:31,110
I'm the most disheveled unfashionable
person you could possibly imagine.

1435
01:29:31,111 --> 01:29:34,170
Which of those three should I start with?
Let me give you another one then.

1436
01:29:34,470 --> 01:29:35,230
I think,

1437
01:29:35,230 --> 01:29:39,240
let me give you one that I think the
best of them all is called ballet for 22

1438
01:29:40,170 --> 01:29:42,840
and it's on Netflix.
It's a,

1439
01:29:43,020 --> 01:29:46,830
so American Ballet Theater has
a choreographic internship.

1440
01:29:46,860 --> 01:29:50,040
That's I think the most procedures
quo choreographic award.

1441
01:29:50,041 --> 01:29:54,930
A young person can win and people compete
I think from all over the world for it,

1442
01:29:54,931 --> 01:29:55,750
I think.

1443
01:29:55,750 --> 01:30:00,630
And one the person who won it one year
was someone inside their own company who

1444
01:30:00,631 --> 01:30:04,230
was just sort of a middling dancer in
their company and who's only 24 which I

1445
01:30:04,231 --> 01:30:06,870
think the youngest I've ever given it to.

1446
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:12,420
And it tracks his internship
and his choreographic process.

1447
01:30:12,750 --> 01:30:15,930
And when you meet him you'd think
he's a complete Yahoo. Right?

1448
01:30:15,931 --> 01:30:19,470
You just think this, he doesn't seem
smart. He doesn't seem charismatic.

1449
01:30:19,471 --> 01:30:23,790
The guy's name is Justin Peck.
You don't see why they gave it to them.

1450
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:26,610
You're just sort of watching this
movie thinking it's dull, you know,

1451
01:30:26,611 --> 01:30:28,650
watching paint dry because
there's no narration.

1452
01:30:29,070 --> 01:30:33,990
It's 100% watching this guy work
and about 15 or 20 minutes into it,

1453
01:30:34,290 --> 01:30:39,090
you start to see him at Orrick and you
start to realize slowly by slowly you are

1454
01:30:39,091 --> 01:30:43,260
watching a genius and you're
watching like a Mozart who was,

1455
01:30:43,650 --> 01:30:48,650
who was just gifted with something
that is absolutely unrivaled.

1456
01:30:50,070 --> 01:30:51,570
And it's only like an hour and 10 minutes,

1457
01:30:51,571 --> 01:30:53,640
but it's the best hour and
10 minutes you'll ever spend.

1458
01:30:53,641 --> 01:30:58,170
Cause you'll get to see true genius in
process without any editorializing. Oh,

1459
01:30:58,171 --> 01:30:58,350
cool.

1460
01:30:58,350 --> 01:31:03,090
And He's 22 ballet for 22 and he's since
become the best choreographer in the

1461
01:31:03,091 --> 01:31:06,960
world. Wow. And he's, he's
young, you know, but you,

1462
01:31:07,080 --> 01:31:08,400
you get to watch it happen.

1463
01:31:11,910 --> 01:31:14,730
Have you seen, and it's, it's a bit of a,

1464
01:31:16,380 --> 01:31:19,410
they use this in a loving way,
bumbling documentary. It's,

1465
01:31:19,460 --> 01:31:22,320
it doesn't take itself too seriously.
Uh,

1466
01:31:22,380 --> 01:31:27,090
but there are aspects of it that I've
found so hilarious that I could, I could,

1467
01:31:27,180 --> 01:31:31,650
I could, uh, I could charge through
it, but six days to air about,

1468
01:31:31,740 --> 01:31:32,281
tell me about it.

1469
01:31:32,281 --> 01:31:37,281
It's about the South Park team putting
together an episode from scratch,

1470
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:43,920
zero nothing to shipping finished
product for air in six days.

1471
01:31:44,450 --> 01:31:49,380
I would see that. I love after they
went to the, I wanna say the, Ah,

1472
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:52,920
I'm so out out of La la land.
Maybe went to the Emmy's,

1473
01:31:53,220 --> 01:31:55,080
perhaps I'll just say the Emmys,
they went to the Emmy's,

1474
01:31:55,100 --> 01:32:00,100
the Golden Globes or something in
women's dresses on acid and the only,

1475
01:32:01,720 --> 01:32:05,140
the committed to each other that every
time they're interviewed on the red

1476
01:32:05,141 --> 01:32:07,540
carpet, they could talk about
anything except for the dresses.

1477
01:32:07,540 --> 01:32:10,510
They couldn't even make a mention of
the fact that they were in dresses and

1478
01:32:10,511 --> 01:32:13,120
they're on acid. And then they get back
to the office and they're like, holy fuck,

1479
01:32:13,121 --> 01:32:16,330
we only have six days to ship a new
episode. Better get to work on that.

1480
01:32:16,331 --> 01:32:20,140
And then it's just crunch time all
nighters in Saturday that's being watched

1481
01:32:20,141 --> 01:32:20,950
tonight.

1482
01:32:20,950 --> 01:32:25,950
Sounds so good with that and like that
kind of stuff where you get to see how

1483
01:32:25,961 --> 01:32:29,470
the sausage is made. Is is really the
only type of documentary I want to watch.

1484
01:32:29,500 --> 01:32:29,800
There's,

1485
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:34,330
there's another one that everybody should
watch called dumb theater of war about

1486
01:32:34,570 --> 01:32:36,530
the making of mother courage.
Uh,

1487
01:32:36,550 --> 01:32:40,600
when they did it in central park with
Meryl Streep and it's the only time Meryl

1488
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:44,140
Streep is ever let anybody
film her rehearsing ever.

1489
01:32:44,890 --> 01:32:47,140
And she said she didn't want to
do it cause she goes to rehearsal,

1490
01:32:47,141 --> 01:32:50,730
looks like bad acting and she goes,
I don't want to see me, you know,

1491
01:32:50,740 --> 01:32:52,000
do bad acting.
And then she goes,

1492
01:32:52,001 --> 01:32:55,000
I thought then she changed her mind
and thought maybe it would be valuable.

1493
01:32:55,540 --> 01:33:00,340
And to get to watch Meryl
Streep's rehearsal process,
you realize how much it is,

1494
01:33:00,580 --> 01:33:03,700
how much a bad, you know, how
much of writing in the beginning,

1495
01:33:03,701 --> 01:33:05,890
how much of acting in the beginning.
All of it is bad.

1496
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:10,120
It's just about doing all the bad stuff
to get to the good stuff, you know?

1497
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:13,630
For sure. So yeah, I love it. That's
another great one. All right. I've been a,

1498
01:33:13,631 --> 01:33:15,360
I've been making a list of docs to watch.

1499
01:33:15,361 --> 01:33:19,120
So now I was already on
this yesterday in my mind.

1500
01:33:19,121 --> 01:33:22,030
So now we have a bunch of
new ones to work on. Let me,

1501
01:33:22,540 --> 01:33:27,190
let me jump to I suppose what I always
call these rapid fire questions,

1502
01:33:27,191 --> 01:33:29,740
but your answers don't
need to be short or rapid.

1503
01:33:31,750 --> 01:33:36,750
What book or books have you given the
most as gifts to other people if you have,

1504
01:33:36,911 --> 01:33:41,380
besides your own? Um, I would
say a little life for sure.

1505
01:33:41,381 --> 01:33:45,880
And then a book called the
velvet rage. Um, the velvet rage,

1506
01:33:46,180 --> 01:33:50,170
the velvet rage, which is
extensively about, you know, if,

1507
01:33:50,230 --> 01:33:54,400
if you grow up a game man,
like how to deal with it, um,

1508
01:33:54,640 --> 01:33:56,230
you know,
in the world.

1509
01:33:56,231 --> 01:34:01,231
But I think it's more about
modern masculinity and
about sort of what it means

1510
01:34:01,421 --> 01:34:04,450
to be a man in America. And, um,

1511
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:09,070
so even for a Hetero normative?
I think so. I think so. I think,

1512
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:10,221
you know,
the,

1513
01:34:10,221 --> 01:34:14,380
the one thing a little life in that
book share in common is an attempt to

1514
01:34:14,470 --> 01:34:17,830
deconstruct what,
you know,

1515
01:34:17,860 --> 01:34:19,860
the tenants of being a man are in,

1516
01:34:19,910 --> 01:34:24,910
in this country because I think it
ultimately restricts emotional health,

1517
01:34:25,270 --> 01:34:27,490
you know? And so, um, you know,

1518
01:34:27,491 --> 01:34:31,530
I think both those books sort of give
you a window into all alternative and,

1519
01:34:31,700 --> 01:34:32,980
and yeah,
here's a,

1520
01:34:32,981 --> 01:34:37,981
if you wanted a different shade of gray
in a book with all your spare time that

1521
01:34:41,901 --> 01:34:46,300
you, that you might enjoy that a
number of my friends, male and female,

1522
01:34:46,301 --> 01:34:50,050
have just found an extremely powerful
is tribe by Sebastian younger.

1523
01:34:51,010 --> 01:34:53,350
And I think it's,
uh,

1524
01:34:54,100 --> 01:34:56,620
I found it to be just a fantastic,

1525
01:34:57,890 --> 01:35:02,890
fantastic and thought provoking book that
helps to explain a lot of what we see

1526
01:35:03,501 --> 01:35:04,334
in the world.

1527
01:35:04,610 --> 01:35:09,200
And it might add just a different lens
through which to look at that as well.

1528
01:35:13,460 --> 01:35:18,200
What is the, what is the best
investment you've ever made?

1529
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:22,760
And that could be energy, time,
money, or any other resource.

1530
01:35:23,420 --> 01:35:26,840
And I'll, I'll give you an
example. So, for instance,

1531
01:35:26,841 --> 01:35:29,840
Amelia Boone is a three time
world's toughest mudder champion.

1532
01:35:30,350 --> 01:35:33,860
Also power attorney had apple,
uh, just a killer Cyborg.

1533
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:38,870
And I asked her this question and she
said it was the entrance fee for her first

1534
01:35:39,020 --> 01:35:42,170
world's toughest mudder, or it might've
been our first very toughest mudder.

1535
01:35:42,380 --> 01:35:44,510
In either case,
the fee was $450,

1536
01:35:44,511 --> 01:35:48,020
which for her at the time was
actually a stretch. But if she hadn't,

1537
01:35:48,230 --> 01:35:53,230
if she hadn't done that this entire other
career and life for her wouldn't have

1538
01:35:53,991 --> 01:35:58,100
opened. Uh, does anything come to mind
for you? It doesn't have to be the best,

1539
01:35:58,101 --> 01:36:01,880
but it could be one of the best
investments. This is so small,

1540
01:36:01,881 --> 01:36:06,080
but it made a big difference in
my life, which was that, you know,

1541
01:36:06,590 --> 01:36:07,270
um,

1542
01:36:07,270 --> 01:36:11,810
I had struggled with just like acne for
a lot of my teenage years and it was

1543
01:36:11,811 --> 01:36:14,900
something that like I couldn't get rid of.
And as an adult,

1544
01:36:14,901 --> 01:36:19,160
just having like breakouts and
stuff and I, you know, you just,

1545
01:36:19,880 --> 01:36:22,910
it starts again in your head a little
bit, you know, that you can get rid of it.

1546
01:36:22,911 --> 01:36:25,910
And so you try everything. That's
the problem. When, when you're built,

1547
01:36:25,911 --> 01:36:27,710
like you know me and a
lot of your listeners,

1548
01:36:28,130 --> 01:36:32,690
you try every effing thing and so
you're going to doctor after doctor,

1549
01:36:32,691 --> 01:36:37,250
you're trying antibiotics, you're trying
creams, you're trying every kind of soap.

1550
01:36:37,460 --> 01:36:41,600
And I just had had it like I just gave up.

1551
01:36:41,630 --> 01:36:46,460
And so then I read this story in the
Times about a company that had started,

1552
01:36:46,461 --> 01:36:49,910
it was called AOL, AOL
plus biome. I know. I,

1553
01:36:51,350 --> 01:36:55,040
okay. Yes, absolutely. So I
became one of the early adopters.

1554
01:36:55,041 --> 01:36:57,950
I was one of the first 10
people to try the product.

1555
01:36:57,951 --> 01:37:00,110
Could you describe for people this,
this was my,

1556
01:37:00,500 --> 01:37:04,430
my year without soap or something like
that. Oh yeah. So you've done it. Oh, I,

1557
01:37:04,460 --> 01:37:09,460
I actually got a prototype sample
of Aot biome way back in the day.

1558
01:37:11,210 --> 01:37:16,040
Uh, which, which has its own story too.
But can you describe for people, well,

1559
01:37:16,130 --> 01:37:17,960
I mean you could take stab at,
I can take a stab at it,

1560
01:37:17,961 --> 01:37:22,220
but could you describe for people what
this is? It's not antibacterial for sure.

1561
01:37:22,490 --> 01:37:25,760
No, it's the opposite. Tell me if
I'm wrong. It, as far as I know,

1562
01:37:25,761 --> 01:37:27,230
it's a probiotic spray.

1563
01:37:28,130 --> 01:37:32,570
It's a spray that's just
pure water and, uh, you know,

1564
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:36,410
bacteria that's supposed to naturally
reside in your skin because they're,

1565
01:37:36,411 --> 01:37:41,390
they're sort of hypothesis was
animals don't use soap and, you know,

1566
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:46,490
don't, we'll be, have skin issues
as regularly as humans do. Um,

1567
01:37:46,580 --> 01:37:51,170
because they have a certain kind of
bacteria that, that sort of, uh, you know,

1568
01:37:51,171 --> 01:37:55,440
sort of oxidizes all the,
um, the bad bacteria.

1569
01:37:55,710 --> 01:37:58,590
And so they created this
bacterial spray that they said,

1570
01:37:58,591 --> 01:38:01,350
all you need to do is throw
out all yourself, any cream,

1571
01:38:01,380 --> 01:38:04,800
anything you've ever used in your
entire life, and just use this,

1572
01:38:04,801 --> 01:38:08,610
you don't even have to shower and
you potentially would be fine.

1573
01:38:08,640 --> 01:38:11,910
And so I was desperate.
I was desperate.

1574
01:38:12,060 --> 01:38:15,540
And so I became one of their first
customers, tried it within three days.

1575
01:38:16,110 --> 01:38:19,630
My skin was clear and I had been
using it three and a half years. Um,

1576
01:38:19,770 --> 01:38:23,220
they are now called mother dirt. They've
changed their name. Oh, they did? Okay.

1577
01:38:23,270 --> 01:38:27,930
Multi plus bio was not, yeah,
it doesn't roll off the tongue.

1578
01:38:28,230 --> 01:38:30,600
Marketable. They, they, you
know, and they have, um,

1579
01:38:30,810 --> 01:38:34,170
they have a shaving cream now that
you can use. They have a shampoo,

1580
01:38:34,550 --> 01:38:38,940
a that you can use that that is
sort of bacteria friendly and man,

1581
01:38:39,180 --> 01:38:41,580
it made a difference. Let
me tell you that, like,

1582
01:38:41,610 --> 01:38:46,610
it just changed everything because
you just forget the skin thing.

1583
01:38:46,921 --> 01:38:48,120
I mean that's just superficial.

1584
01:38:48,660 --> 01:38:53,400
But to realize that the problems you were
chasing for 10 years or more than that

1585
01:38:53,430 --> 01:38:58,430
could be solved by your own body and buy
something that was natural already that

1586
01:38:58,711 --> 01:39:01,470
theoretically like you don't even
need the missed at some level.

1587
01:39:01,471 --> 01:39:03,030
Like if I don't have it for a week,

1588
01:39:03,031 --> 01:39:06,570
I just don't use soap and then my skin
goes back to who stays completely fine,

1589
01:39:07,020 --> 01:39:09,300
you know? Definitely. So it was a,

1590
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:13,620
that was a big shift and it's called
mother dirt now mother dirt mother.

1591
01:39:14,220 --> 01:39:16,380
If people want to read
the New York Times piece,

1592
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:18,810
The New York Times does what I do,
which is confusing.

1593
01:39:18,811 --> 01:39:23,811
Sometimes they'll use a different headline
online versus in the print edition.

1594
01:39:24,451 --> 01:39:28,230
And then it makes things very confusing
for people. But it's the, uh, let's see,

1595
01:39:28,231 --> 01:39:32,310
my no soap, no shampoo, bacteria
rich hygiene experiment.

1596
01:39:33,210 --> 01:39:34,230
And I think the,

1597
01:39:34,231 --> 01:39:38,220
I think the author's name is Julius Scott
discovers what she smells like after

1598
01:39:38,221 --> 01:39:42,960
28 surplus days. It's
fascinating. It's really, really
fascinating. Yeah. Everyone,

1599
01:39:42,961 --> 01:39:44,170
everyone should be on this product.

1600
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:49,830
I feel like it's a market
that's going to explode soon.

1601
01:39:49,980 --> 01:39:54,540
What, uh, what other tricks
do you have like that?

1602
01:39:54,541 --> 01:39:56,310
Do you have any other,
uh,

1603
01:39:57,090 --> 01:40:02,090
any other expedient solutions to come?

1604
01:40:02,221 --> 01:40:05,460
Problems like that and some
of the things, so, you know,

1605
01:40:05,461 --> 01:40:09,750
just cause I feel like everyone's
stress goes somewhere in their body.

1606
01:40:09,751 --> 01:40:13,140
Like some people get back pain and that
becomes their, their big thing. You know,

1607
01:40:13,590 --> 01:40:17,210
with me it's usually it was always
skin until that was solved. Um,

1608
01:40:17,250 --> 01:40:21,060
and then I guess when I was younger
it was, um, uh, stomach. Yeah.

1609
01:40:21,061 --> 01:40:24,420
One of my best friends has that he has
his, he always gets stomach issues,

1610
01:40:24,490 --> 01:40:25,081
stomach issues.

1611
01:40:25,081 --> 01:40:28,140
And also because I was on antibiotics
for the skin problems when I was a

1612
01:40:28,141 --> 01:40:31,680
teenager. So that was something
that stuck around. And I'm, again,

1613
01:40:31,681 --> 01:40:35,520
I did a lot of research and
realized that, um, you know,

1614
01:40:37,580 --> 01:40:41,700
you can take a daily probiotic,
but that probably won't be enough.

1615
01:40:41,730 --> 01:40:46,500
And so I sort of cobbled together my own
probiotic therapy where I would buy two

1616
01:40:46,501 --> 01:40:51,400
or three bottles of different brands and
take those on tour when you're sleeping

1617
01:40:51,401 --> 01:40:54,970
at, you know, basically not
sleeping, God knows what you know,

1618
01:40:54,971 --> 01:40:59,060
and completely off rhythm
and just by taking, yeah.

1619
01:40:59,210 --> 01:41:02,980
Maybe like eight probiotic pills
a night from, you know, whatever,

1620
01:41:02,981 --> 01:41:06,040
a combination of different brands.
It's solved all my problems.

1621
01:41:06,041 --> 01:41:10,640
I can travel anywhere in the world and
as long as I'm overdosing on probiotics

1622
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:14,940
with different, mixing up different
brands, no issues whatsoever. It's,

1623
01:41:14,941 --> 01:41:18,270
it's the mix of the different brands
that I think is, is what is key. Right.

1624
01:41:19,540 --> 01:41:23,000
And then the other, the other
thing that helps to sleep, uh,

1625
01:41:23,040 --> 01:41:26,700
just in terms of insomnia as if
you have a aroma therapy diffuser,

1626
01:41:26,930 --> 01:41:31,790
one of those sort of would diffusers they
can get off Amazon for like $20. MMM.

1627
01:41:31,980 --> 01:41:36,760
And Use lavender oil. Yeah. [inaudible]
it old zonk you out very, very fast.

1628
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,580
Lavender oil. All right, I'll
have to play around with this.

1629
01:41:40,581 --> 01:41:45,581
I started using heat diffuser for the
first time after I had Nicholas McCarthy

1630
01:41:47,360 --> 01:41:52,100
on the podcast too is a one armed
or I should say more accurately,

1631
01:41:52,101 --> 01:41:55,190
one handed concert pianist and he,

1632
01:41:55,400 --> 01:41:59,060
and he uses Geranium
oil when he's composing.

1633
01:41:59,061 --> 01:42:03,050
He said it's the perfect mixture
of relaxation without sleepiness.

1634
01:42:03,051 --> 01:42:05,390
It's relaxation plus alertness for him.

1635
01:42:05,391 --> 01:42:08,410
So I used Geranium oil for,

1636
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:13,640
for a lot of my editing and writing
sessions when I did tools of titans.

1637
01:42:14,031 --> 01:42:14,864
Do you use,

1638
01:42:15,260 --> 01:42:19,600
do you use the diffuser for anything
other than lavender oil or is that,

1639
01:42:19,780 --> 01:42:24,490
do I use, what's funny is
this is such a stupid answer,

1640
01:42:24,491 --> 01:42:27,980
but at the sort of food market I go to,

1641
01:42:27,981 --> 01:42:32,981
they have this basket of 50% off oils
of whatever as in sold that week or

1642
01:42:33,141 --> 01:42:34,610
whatever.
So I just buy whatever's in there.

1643
01:42:34,611 --> 01:42:37,460
So I never really keep track of
what's in the diffuser on any day.

1644
01:42:37,461 --> 01:42:41,960
It's just a different smell.
Welcome to my life,

1645
01:42:42,200 --> 01:42:45,370
but I'm willing to cede control
over what oil is in the,

1646
01:42:46,840 --> 01:42:51,240
when, when you're traveling as
much as it sounds like you do 60,

1647
01:42:51,241 --> 01:42:56,241
80 days a year and I'm sure you
have other non tour related travel.

1648
01:42:58,380 --> 01:43:01,090
Do you have any tips for uh,

1649
01:43:01,320 --> 01:43:06,090
minimizing onset of cold, flu, et
Cetera, things like that? You know,

1650
01:43:06,091 --> 01:43:06,924
I think

1651
01:43:07,050 --> 01:43:11,820
before this, the steam thing
before I leave helps a lot, um,

1652
01:43:11,900 --> 01:43:15,560
because it really does clear your sinuses
cause that's where you can get sinus

1653
01:43:15,561 --> 01:43:19,550
infections. And I think I was prone
to those, you know, a lot. Um,

1654
01:43:19,940 --> 01:43:22,700
and I think when I'm on tour,
and it's funny,

1655
01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:27,470
I read a book about Steven Spielberg who
apparently does the same thing when we,

1656
01:43:27,471 --> 01:43:29,740
whenever he is, Oh, I'm
sorry. Okay, go ahead. What?

1657
01:43:29,741 --> 01:43:34,040
He's shooting a movie for him not
to get sick, which is he drinks,

1658
01:43:34,420 --> 01:43:38,650
uh, t incessantly and
herbal tea. Just, you know,

1659
01:43:38,920 --> 01:43:43,570
he's just constantly trying to stay warm
because you never know what the weather

1660
01:43:43,571 --> 01:43:44,890
is. You never know what the
situation is going to be.

1661
01:43:44,891 --> 01:43:48,790
But he's just always downing
hot tea of some herbal variety.

1662
01:43:48,791 --> 01:43:51,770
And I think when I'm on tour, everywhere
I go, every time I get in the car,

1663
01:43:51,771 --> 01:43:53,760
I get a hot tea. Every time I
get to a school I drink a hot.

1664
01:43:53,830 --> 01:43:55,760
So I'm drinking like
seven or eight cups a day.

1665
01:43:56,000 --> 01:44:00,950
Do you have a Goto hot tier or is it like
the 50% off? It's, it's, you know, if I,

1666
01:44:00,951 --> 01:44:04,040
if I can get to a Starbucks, they've got
the Mint Majesty, which is really good.

1667
01:44:04,520 --> 01:44:05,120
I mean,

1668
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:08,690
we should preface this all by saying
that I can't drink caffeine because it

1669
01:44:08,691 --> 01:44:13,580
makes me crazy.
Do you drink,

1670
01:44:13,581 --> 01:44:15,690
do you drink alcohol or no,
no.

1671
01:44:15,890 --> 01:44:20,360
I mean a glass of wine if it's been
a particularly horrific day. But,

1672
01:44:20,750 --> 01:44:24,530
um, otherwise, uh, not really. I just, uh,

1673
01:44:26,210 --> 01:44:29,930
you don't need it. You don't need
the enhancement or I'll tell you why.

1674
01:44:29,931 --> 01:44:32,900
Andy Capp one way or the
other. This is what I would
say, and this is, this is sad,

1675
01:44:32,901 --> 01:44:34,850
but I think there's a happy lining to it,

1676
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:39,880
which is that I spent so
long in my twenties and teens
trying to get control of

1677
01:44:41,121 --> 01:44:44,930
my brain and trying to, to make it a happy
place. Do you know what I mean? Sure.

1678
01:44:44,950 --> 01:44:48,860
And when I finally found peace of mind
and sort of the creative space to be able

1679
01:44:48,861 --> 01:44:53,090
to work in and now live
in a, in a fairly, um,

1680
01:44:53,930 --> 01:44:58,130
I dunno, just like constant
state of, of goodness.

1681
01:44:58,790 --> 01:45:02,810
I don't want to mess it up. You know,
I get it. Totally. I think that's, uh,

1682
01:45:03,650 --> 01:45:07,490
that's where, where I am at the
moment, you know? Um, but yeah.

1683
01:45:08,240 --> 01:45:09,110
What,
uh,

1684
01:45:10,790 --> 01:45:14,690
what topic would you speak about if you
had to give a Ted talk on something that

1685
01:45:14,691 --> 01:45:18,890
you're not known for at all? So it
can't be, can't, can't be tutoring,

1686
01:45:19,070 --> 01:45:22,460
can't be tennis,
can't be tenants,

1687
01:45:22,480 --> 01:45:25,130
can't certainly can't be the
writing that you're doing.

1688
01:45:25,970 --> 01:45:30,200
It might be on things that make people
laugh because I've done all these studies.

1689
01:45:30,201 --> 01:45:32,420
Because when, when you're
writing, you want to,

1690
01:45:32,840 --> 01:45:35,950
you want to get to the sense of what
makes kids laugh, right? Because as,

1691
01:45:35,951 --> 01:45:38,810
as horrific as a school for getting
evil books are at times or they're quite

1692
01:45:38,811 --> 01:45:42,590
dark, they're also, they're
also quite funny. Um,

1693
01:45:43,100 --> 01:45:46,070
and a lot of it is trying to find
out what, what makes kids laugh.

1694
01:45:46,071 --> 01:45:49,970
And so I would do a Ted talk.
I would, I would hope on this,

1695
01:45:50,480 --> 01:45:52,990
I read this book or this study about,
you know,

1696
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:57,530
these people who spent like 10 years
trying to figure out what makes people of

1697
01:45:57,531 --> 01:45:59,060
all cultures laugh no matter what.

1698
01:45:59,120 --> 01:46:01,340
Like even if you go to the
recesses of the Amazon,

1699
01:46:02,270 --> 01:46:06,830
it'll make people laugh and they came up
with four things and before things were

1700
01:46:08,300 --> 01:46:11,090
okay were there,
try not to die laughing while I say this,

1701
01:46:11,330 --> 01:46:15,590
number one is beating someone
with a kitchen utensil.

1702
01:46:17,500 --> 01:46:20,270
Got It. Good. Good to know. Okay.

1703
01:46:20,271 --> 01:46:22,820
Number two is falling down
a short flight of stairs,

1704
01:46:24,050 --> 01:46:27,110
which apparently no matter where you are,
it makes people laugh.

1705
01:46:28,490 --> 01:46:33,400
Number three is, um, a swift fart
delivered in silos going to say far,

1706
01:46:33,401 --> 01:46:34,570
it has to be,
and there somewhere,

1707
01:46:34,580 --> 01:46:38,720
which as I like us was a swift
fart delivered in silence.

1708
01:46:39,170 --> 01:46:41,630
That could also be the name of my memoir.

1709
01:46:43,180 --> 01:46:44,390
And I use that.

1710
01:46:44,391 --> 01:46:48,830
I use that in chapter three of the first
book and it's always mentioned as one

1711
01:46:48,831 --> 01:46:50,520
of the kids' favorite moments.
And I'm like, of course,

1712
01:46:50,521 --> 01:46:54,540
because it's one of the four, four
things and number four is number four.

1713
01:46:54,541 --> 01:46:56,550
It was such a shock. And then, um,

1714
01:46:56,850 --> 01:47:00,720
it stayed with me is
adults dressed as twins.

1715
01:47:01,410 --> 01:47:04,080
What adults dresses?
Twins.

1716
01:47:04,081 --> 01:47:09,081
If you parade two adults dressed in the
same clothes in front of a weird tribe

1717
01:47:09,421 --> 01:47:11,910
in the middle of the Amazon,
everyone will laugh.

1718
01:47:15,070 --> 01:47:17,310
All right, that would make a good
ted talk because I just think,

1719
01:47:17,340 --> 01:47:20,780
I think things like that, like what
connects everybody, right? What are,

1720
01:47:20,790 --> 01:47:25,620
what are the common denominators?
I just think those are important.

1721
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:28,380
And so I'm trying to get to the bottom
of those cause that's what fairytales are

1722
01:47:28,381 --> 01:47:30,030
also, right? That's at the end of the day,

1723
01:47:30,050 --> 01:47:33,550
school for getting evil at
their core are our fairytale.

1724
01:47:33,610 --> 01:47:36,930
So I'm trying to get to
the be essential Nis of,

1725
01:47:36,990 --> 01:47:40,590
and maybe this is why I'm so focused
on Zen and meditation and trying to

1726
01:47:40,591 --> 01:47:44,220
understand the world beyond the matrix
of trying to get to the bottom of like

1727
01:47:44,221 --> 01:47:48,270
what connects every kid, what
connects every one of us,
you know, before are blank.

1728
01:47:48,271 --> 01:47:52,440
Slates are filled. Definitely.
What is, what is the

1729
01:47:54,030 --> 01:47:59,030
bad advice that you hear
given out often in your world?

1730
01:47:59,190 --> 01:48:01,800
And I'm deliberately keeping that very,
very

1731
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:07,140
broad. Not going to define your world for
you. You can take it any way you want.

1732
01:48:07,500 --> 01:48:09,660
I think when people say,
you know,

1733
01:48:12,180 --> 01:48:16,680
this whole idea of like following
your passion, right? Following what,

1734
01:48:16,750 --> 01:48:20,370
what you think you are meant to do or,
or following what you love,

1735
01:48:21,090 --> 01:48:25,890
I don't always know is going to
lead you somewhere productive.

1736
01:48:26,070 --> 01:48:29,820
Because I think ultimately what you are
meant to do isn't necessarily what you

1737
01:48:29,821 --> 01:48:33,420
love. It's, it's um, what you're good at.

1738
01:48:33,660 --> 01:48:36,990
It's what you were divinely meant to do,
what you're good at.

1739
01:48:37,020 --> 01:48:39,270
And I always think that's the
better question. What do you,

1740
01:48:39,480 --> 01:48:42,630
what are you better at than anyone else
in the whole world? What would you,

1741
01:48:42,840 --> 01:48:46,890
what would you put yourself against
anyone else in the whole world against,

1742
01:48:47,130 --> 01:48:48,850
you know, at, um,

1743
01:48:49,140 --> 01:48:52,320
and I think that's what's going to lead
you somewhere really good following,

1744
01:48:52,350 --> 01:48:55,960
you know, cause what everybody
wants to be, you know, uh,

1745
01:48:56,100 --> 01:49:00,000
a professional athlete or movie
star at some level. So I dunno,

1746
01:49:00,030 --> 01:49:03,210
following what you love or your passion
is necessarily going to guide you to the

1747
01:49:03,211 --> 01:49:08,190
most fulfilling career. Well,
I think it's also easier,

1748
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:11,610
let's see,

1749
01:49:11,610 --> 01:49:15,750
easier in the sense that there are more
options for taking something you are

1750
01:49:15,751 --> 01:49:16,920
good at and,

1751
01:49:18,060 --> 01:49:23,060
and molding it into something you can
be excited about or combining it with

1752
01:49:24,391 --> 01:49:26,190
other things that you are excited about.

1753
01:49:26,220 --> 01:49:31,220
Then starting with an undirected passion
and then trying to become good at

1754
01:49:33,961 --> 01:49:37,470
wherever that leads you. Oh, you're
right. You're right. You're 100% right.

1755
01:49:37,471 --> 01:49:42,030
Because if you're just following
the passion, you don't have the,

1756
01:49:42,210 --> 01:49:44,700
whatever it is,
the 10,000 hours that is,

1757
01:49:45,060 --> 01:49:48,170
that is behind mastery even right

1758
01:49:48,260 --> 01:49:50,470
now. Get going. Yeah.

1759
01:49:51,430 --> 01:49:56,230
If you could have one gigantic billboard
anywhere with anything on it, you know,

1760
01:49:56,231 --> 01:50:00,670
short message, no advertising.
Uh, what would you,

1761
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:03,010
what would you put on it?
A message to get out to the world?

1762
01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:08,460
I think one of two things. One is
if I'm in New York, it would be, um,

1763
01:50:09,120 --> 01:50:11,970
death is coming. You know,
I'm, one of the things I'm,

1764
01:50:12,030 --> 01:50:15,940
I meditate on a lot is just
what it would feel like to die.

1765
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,520
That's the other thing. Oh,
besides that, looking for the me,

1766
01:50:18,910 --> 01:50:22,580
some days I just try to imagine what it
would feel like for everything to just

1767
01:50:22,910 --> 01:50:26,450
disappear first, the something of
consciousness to become nothing.

1768
01:50:26,870 --> 01:50:29,530
So actually trying to experience death.
Um,

1769
01:50:29,600 --> 01:50:34,600
and I think that has led me more towards
happiness than anything else in my life

1770
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:40,810
is so like trying to understand that
your life is short and it's going to end

1771
01:50:40,811 --> 01:50:45,280
and it can end at any minute. So
take advantage, right? Really,

1772
01:50:45,370 --> 01:50:49,090
really try to make of your life
everything you can, you know?

1773
01:50:49,091 --> 01:50:51,910
So that's the one thing. And
then the second one is, um,

1774
01:50:52,330 --> 01:50:56,920
when I'm in Miami because my parents have
a beach house on this island and it's

1775
01:50:56,921 --> 01:50:58,570
so clear,
uh,

1776
01:50:58,630 --> 01:51:02,020
above that you can see that this
sort of night sky with the stars.

1777
01:51:02,470 --> 01:51:04,780
And so if I was anywhere else
but New York, I would just say,

1778
01:51:04,781 --> 01:51:08,500
look at the stars cause you can't see
stars and in New York because every time

1779
01:51:08,501 --> 01:51:11,320
you look up there, you realize the
fact that there's life on earth.

1780
01:51:11,920 --> 01:51:15,880
It's such a weird freak accident
that should never have happened.

1781
01:51:16,300 --> 01:51:21,070
And there is no meaning to life
necessarily in the larger cosmic scheme of

1782
01:51:21,071 --> 01:51:23,200
things. It's just a
fluke. It's an accident.

1783
01:51:23,590 --> 01:51:26,890
So enjoy it because
the fact that you know,

1784
01:51:26,891 --> 01:51:30,880
you got to have a life in the first
place compared to the sort of infinity of

1785
01:51:30,881 --> 01:51:33,580
the universe is, um,
it's pretty remarkable.

1786
01:51:35,380 --> 01:51:37,390
I like that.
And it,

1787
01:51:37,520 --> 01:51:42,310
it surprisingly echoes the
thoughts of two very disparate

1788
01:51:44,230 --> 01:51:48,070
people I've had on the podcast. Also, Bj
Miller, who's a palliative care physician,

1789
01:51:48,100 --> 01:51:53,060
helps people to die in hospice care.
And Ed Cooke who is a,

1790
01:51:53,090 --> 01:51:57,460
a memory champion and
entrepreneur from the UK.

1791
01:51:57,490 --> 01:51:59,500
Both talk about the
stars in a similar way.

1792
01:52:00,070 --> 01:52:05,050
So I think that is a profound
place to start. To wrap up,

1793
01:52:05,051 --> 01:52:08,410
just a few more questions and then I'll
certainly ask at the very end where

1794
01:52:08,411 --> 01:52:10,210
people can find you and so on.
But do you have any,

1795
01:52:11,050 --> 01:52:15,790
any ask or request or suggestion
for the audience? Any, any,

1796
01:52:15,880 --> 01:52:20,320
any parting words or
recommendations, suggestions, please.

1797
01:52:21,550 --> 01:52:23,970
I would just say that
I think, you know, if,

1798
01:52:24,120 --> 01:52:28,310
if these are sort of the principles
that you're interested in, uh,

1799
01:52:28,311 --> 01:52:32,180
not just for yourself
but for, for kids, um,

1800
01:52:32,300 --> 01:52:35,990
either your own or somebody else's.
I think this,

1801
01:52:36,050 --> 01:52:41,050
this book series well sort of lead those
kids in the right direction because it

1802
01:52:41,531 --> 01:52:46,060
forces them to question
all their assumptions about
what good and evil are, uh,

1803
01:52:46,250 --> 01:52:49,900
about what they usually see in
the world and about, you know,

1804
01:52:50,740 --> 01:52:54,100
what their life is going to look like.
And it's about, it's about empowering,

1805
01:52:54,130 --> 01:52:55,150
empowering kids.

1806
01:52:55,151 --> 01:53:00,000
When kids usually don't feel
empowered and usually feel, you know,

1807
01:53:00,010 --> 01:53:04,720
so, so helpless. So it lets them, um,
we interpret what heroes really are.

1808
01:53:04,721 --> 01:53:07,820
So I would just say, um, you know, uh,

1809
01:53:08,050 --> 01:53:12,890
give it to a kid and see what
their reaction is. So when,

1810
01:53:12,891 --> 01:53:16,100
thank you so much for the time.
This has been a blast. Awesome.

1811
01:53:16,210 --> 01:53:21,210
Say it would be great to grab some Mid
Majesty Tea when I'm next in New York or

1812
01:53:21,711 --> 01:53:23,570
you're next in San Francisco.

1813
01:53:23,571 --> 01:53:26,780
Where can people find you
online and learn more about you?

1814
01:53:26,781 --> 01:53:31,630
Say Hello on social if that's, uh, one
of the places to find you. Where, where,

1815
01:53:31,640 --> 01:53:35,240
where should they find you besides
Tinder? In, besides Tinder,

1816
01:53:35,690 --> 01:53:40,290
if only there were a search
function. Alas. Um, let's,

1817
01:53:40,340 --> 01:53:42,510
uh, you know, I think Twitter, um,

1818
01:53:42,590 --> 01:53:45,920
I tend to post very
regularly Instagram as well.

1819
01:53:45,921 --> 01:53:48,770
And then we have our youtube channel,
which is called ever, never TV,

1820
01:53:48,771 --> 01:53:53,320
but that's mainly for, for
the kids. So Twitter and
Instagram for the adults, Eben,

1821
01:53:53,321 --> 01:53:54,920
every ever,
never TD for the kids.

1822
01:53:54,921 --> 01:53:59,400
And also the school for good and
evil website is a treasure trove. Um,

1823
01:53:59,630 --> 01:54:04,580
for any kid under the age of, of 16 of
just even if they haven't read the books,

1824
01:54:04,581 --> 01:54:05,810
it's just a great place to,

1825
01:54:05,830 --> 01:54:09,830
to spend some time because there's so many
awesome interactive features on there.

1826
01:54:10,110 --> 01:54:13,580
Twitter, it's at Soman
Chin Nani, right? Shania.

1827
01:54:13,581 --> 01:54:15,170
Am I getting that right chain on it yet?

1828
01:54:15,200 --> 01:54:18,680
So I'm [inaudible] on Twitter and
then Instagram is Soman see. Got It.

1829
01:54:18,710 --> 01:54:20,780
So m a n c.

1830
01:54:21,590 --> 01:54:24,140
Well so thank you so
much for taking the time.

1831
01:54:24,350 --> 01:54:29,030
I really enjoyed this conversation and
to everybody listening you can find links

1832
01:54:29,031 --> 01:54:32,750
to everything the school for good
and evil. Of course. Everything else,

1833
01:54:32,751 --> 01:54:35,900
all the books you mentioned, all the
docs we mentioned in the show notes,

1834
01:54:36,020 --> 01:54:38,060
which can be found with the
show notes for every other

01:54:38,061 --> 01:54:43,061
episode@fourhourworkweekdotcomforwardslashpodcastallspelledoutforourworkweek.com

1836
01:54:43,910 --> 01:54:48,290
forward slash podcast and as
always and until next time,

1837
01:54:48,590 --> 01:54:49,760
thank you for listening.

1838
01:54:50,410 --> 01:54:53,800
Hey guys, this is Tim again. Just a
few more things before you take off.

1839
01:54:54,130 --> 01:54:56,800
Number one,
this is five bullet Friday.

1840
01:54:57,070 --> 01:55:00,070
Do you want to get a short email from me?

1841
01:55:00,071 --> 01:55:02,680
Would you enjoy getting a short
email from me every Friday?

1842
01:55:02,950 --> 01:55:07,210
That provides a little more soul of
fun before the weekend and five bullet

1843
01:55:07,260 --> 01:55:07,541
Fridays,

1844
01:55:07,541 --> 01:55:12,100
a very short email where
I share the coolest things
I've found or that I've been

1845
01:55:12,101 --> 01:55:13,390
pondering over the week.

1846
01:55:13,630 --> 01:55:16,390
That could include favorite new
albums that I've discovered.

1847
01:55:16,391 --> 01:55:19,840
It could include Gizmos and gadgets
and all sorts of weird shit that I've

1848
01:55:19,841 --> 01:55:24,160
somehow dug up in the, uh, the
world of the esoteric as I do.

1849
01:55:24,460 --> 01:55:29,460
It could include favorite articles that
I've read and that I've shared with my

1850
01:55:30,131 --> 01:55:32,860
close friends for instance.
And it's very short.

1851
01:55:32,920 --> 01:55:37,900
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness
before you head off for the weekend.

1852
01:55:37,960 --> 01:55:40,120
So if you want to receive that,
check it out.

1853
01:55:40,390 --> 01:55:45,360
Just go to a four hour work week.com
that's four work week.com all spelled out

1854
01:55:45,390 --> 01:55:48,240
and just drop in your email and
you will get the very next one.

1855
01:55:48,630 --> 01:55:50,310
And if you sign up,
I hope you enjoy it.

1856
01:55:51,060 --> 01:55:55,020
This episode is brought to you by audible,
which I've used for many, many years.

1857
01:55:55,080 --> 01:55:59,700
I absolutely love audio books and they
are one of my favorite ways to pass the

1858
01:55:59,701 --> 01:56:00,750
time when I travel.

1859
01:56:00,780 --> 01:56:05,040
I'm on the road all the time in audible
allows me to consume many more books

1860
01:56:05,041 --> 01:56:09,390
than I possibly could otherwise I have
to audio books to recommend right off the

1861
01:56:09,391 --> 01:56:09,630
bat.

1862
01:56:09,630 --> 01:56:13,510
The first is perhaps my favorite audio
book of all time and it's the only audio

1863
01:56:13,511 --> 01:56:18,390
book I've wanted to listen to twice in a
row. The graveyard book by Neil Gaiman.

1864
01:56:18,540 --> 01:56:22,350
It's amazing and you will thank me.
There are a few different versions.

1865
01:56:22,650 --> 01:56:25,440
I like the version that
we'll narrates himself,

1866
01:56:25,860 --> 01:56:27,900
one of the most soothing
voices of all time.

1867
01:56:28,260 --> 01:56:33,260
The second book is vagabonding by Rolf
Potts Pott s which had a huge impact on

1868
01:56:34,051 --> 01:56:38,040
my life and formed the basis for a lot
of what would later become the four hour

1869
01:56:38,060 --> 01:56:38,893
workweek,

1870
01:56:38,940 --> 01:56:43,440
so go to audible.com forward slash Tim
and you can choose one of these two books

1871

that could be books, magazines,

1872
01:56:48,360 --> 01:56:50,940
and much more as a listener

1879
01:57:11,370 --> 01:57:13,770
This episode is brought
to you by trunk club.

1880
01:57:14,550 --> 01:57:16,920
There are two types of men out there.
You know who you are,

1881
01:57:17,640 --> 01:57:20,160
guides who love shopping for
clothes for a short on time,

1882
01:57:20,250 --> 01:57:23,670
category A and those of you who hate it,
category B,

1883
01:57:24,150 --> 01:57:25,860
I am in the latter category.

1884
01:57:25,860 --> 01:57:30,860
My fashion sense is also
probably somewhere between
homeless and confused with a

1885
01:57:31,081 --> 01:57:33,840
dash of lazy added in.
Either way.

1886
01:57:34,110 --> 01:57:38,640
You can take heart and I've used trunk
club now and have found some of my

1887
01:57:38,641 --> 01:57:43,170
favorite pieces of clothing that make me
look a lot better than I would be able

1888
01:57:43,171 --> 01:57:46,530
to handle on my own and there
are many reasons for that,

1889
01:57:46,531 --> 01:57:50,310
but you can get clothing that fits
perfectly and looks amazing without ever

1890
01:57:50,311 --> 01:57:54,960
stepping into a store. Again, thanks
to trunk club and they make it very,

1891
01:57:54,961 --> 01:57:59,670
very easy and the clothing's
handpicked by a personal stylist,

1892
01:57:59,671 --> 01:58:00,780
your own personal stylist.

1893
01:58:00,781 --> 01:58:05,100
All you have to have you do is go to trow
club.com forward slash Tim typing your

1894
01:58:05,101 --> 01:58:07,830
measurements,
share your likes and dislikes.

1895
01:58:08,220 --> 01:58:12,720
They'll pick your clothes from more than
80 top brands and ship them right to

1896
01:58:12,721 --> 01:58:15,510
your door. You keep what you like,
you send back what you don't.

1897
01:58:15,900 --> 01:58:18,120
If you don't like any of it and
sent it all back, it doesn't matter.

1898
01:58:18,510 --> 01:58:21,420
And Trunk Club is not
a subscription service.

1899
01:58:21,421 --> 01:58:23,610
This is what appealed to
me among many other things.

1900
01:58:23,611 --> 01:58:27,570
I didn't want to constantly be getting
dinged by things or have to deal with the

1901
01:58:27,571 --> 01:58:30,540
headache of constantly getting boxes.
It's not a subscription service.

1902
01:58:30,870 --> 01:58:34,140
Shipping is always free and you have
five days to try on the clothes.

1903
01:58:34,650 --> 01:58:38,130
So a couple of points here.
Number one,

1904
01:58:38,820 --> 01:58:42,250
get started today. Go to trunk club.com
forward slash. Tim, try it out.

1905
01:58:43,150 --> 01:58:46,720
You get premium, close expert
advice, no work, no risk.

1906
01:58:47,110 --> 01:58:48,880
That is a winning Combo.

1907
01:58:49,210 --> 01:58:54,010
And I have found some of my favorite
espadrilles shoes from them. Bright Green.

1908
01:58:54,290 --> 01:58:56,800
Uh, I do like the color
green and they actually work.

1909
01:58:56,920 --> 01:59:01,000
I've had so many compliments on the
shoes and more people ask me where I got

1910
01:59:01,001 --> 01:59:01,231
them to.

1911
01:59:01,231 --> 01:59:05,620
Any other pair of shoes I've ever had
and more shirts I kept ended up keeping

1912
01:59:05,630 --> 01:59:09,100
about. I would say three quarters of
my box, which I did not expect to do.

1913
01:59:09,730 --> 01:59:12,640
So go to trunk club.com forward
slash Tim and check it out.
