1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:05,060
So I'm recording. Could you just tell me
maybe what you had for breakfast? Yeah,

2
00:00:05,061 --> 00:00:07,490
nothing.
I had nothing for breakfast.

3
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:12,470
I never eat breakfast just once a day.
All right,

4
00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:15,560
we're going to talk about that for sure.
Let me just pause this optimal

5
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:20,830
and start shaking.

6
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,930
I'm a cybernetic organism living.

7
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,710
This episode is brought to you by audible,
which I've used for years.

8
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:46,640
I love audiobooks and I've two
to recommend right off the bat.

9
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:49,940
Number one is press my favorite
audio book of all time,

10
00:00:49,941 --> 00:00:52,700
and that is the graveyard
book by Neil Gaiman.

11
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:56,930
The only audiobook I've wanted to
immediately listen to a second time.

12
00:00:56,931 --> 00:01:01,310
As soon as I finished. It's amazing.
You will thank me. The graveyard book.

13
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,040
The second is vagabonding by Rolf Potts,

14
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:08,720
which had a huge impact on my life and
formed the basis for a lot of what became

15
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:09,770
the four hour workweek.

16
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:14,830

This episode is brought to you by
a new sponsor. So listen up folks.

24
00:01:40,311 --> 00:01:44,270
This is a good one because have you ever
wanted to be as powerful as a mullet

25
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:49,271
wearing Ninja from 1980s movie or as
flamboyant as big gay Al Big Al in south

26
00:01:50,731 --> 00:01:54,810
park or as sleek as a black panther
in the Amazon on the hunt wealth?

27
00:01:54,811 --> 00:01:58,880
There's great news because I've been
testing this product that you wrap around

28
00:01:58,881 --> 00:02:02,270
your genitals and it makes you feel
like a superhero and it is called

29
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,110
[inaudible].

30
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:06,680
I've spent the last two to three weeks
traveling with underwear from these guys

31
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,990
and they are comfy.
I got to tell you,

32
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:13,640
it feels like a Geisha has giving your
groin a hug and it's not just for dudes.

33
00:02:13,641 --> 00:02:18,350
But if you go to [inaudible] dot com
forward slash Tim, that's m, e, e, u n, d,

34
00:02:18,351 --> 00:02:20,330
I e s.com forward slash Tim,

35
00:02:20,331 --> 00:02:23,180
you can see all of the underwear
that I've been wearing.

36
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:28,100
There's some pretty ridiculous ones.
And I will also highlight my favorite,

37
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:29,660
you'll probably be able
to guess which it is.

38
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,300
These underwear made from micro model,

39
00:02:32,301 --> 00:02:36,650
which is extruded from Austrian
beechwood trees in the Alps. Yes, fancy.

40
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:38,450
And it's two times softer than cotton,

41
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:43,130
scientifically tested using the Calamata
method developed in Kyoto. You know,

42
00:02:43,131 --> 00:02:47,510
those Japanese very crafty and uh,
I will say a few things. Number one,

43

45
00:02:53,211 --> 00:02:57,630
And I am a bit of an underwear
connoisseur, socks, fashion
sense with sweatpants,

46
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,830
not so much underwear.

Me undies.com forward slash Tim,

[inaudible] dot com forward slash Tim.

55
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,210
Hello Lemurs and leprechauns.

56
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:34,600
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another
episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

57
00:03:34,601 --> 00:03:37,690
it is my job to deconstruct
world class performers,

58
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,200
whether they are actors
like Arnold Schwarzenegger,

59
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:43,420
military strategists or generals
like Stanley McChrystal,

60
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:47,170
chess prodigies like Josh Waitzkin
or in this particular case,

61
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,210
a miracle worker of sorts.

62
00:03:49,211 --> 00:03:52,480
In fact you could say he
is a daredevil Wim Hoff,

63
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:56,590
otherwise known as the ice man is a
Dutch world record holder, adventurer,

64
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:00,490
certainly daredevil and he's nicknamed
the ice man for his ability to withstand

65
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:01,630
extreme cold.

66
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:05,950
He is creator of the Wim Hoff method
and holds more than 20 world records.

67
00:04:05,951 --> 00:04:08,920
He is in my mind the outlier of outliers,

68
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:14,220
not because he does so many absurd things
and proves that these impossibles are

69
00:04:14,501 --> 00:04:15,460
in fact possible,

70
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:19,930
but he routinely asked scientists to
scrutinize and validate these feats.

71
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,310
That's what makes him very,

72
00:04:21,311 --> 00:04:24,070
very unique and very interesting
for this type of conversation.

73
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,090
What are some of his feet? Well, I'm in
2007 he climbed path, the death zone,

74
00:04:28,091 --> 00:04:29,620
the altitude on Mount Everest,

75
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:32,920
which is around a 7,500 meters
wearing nothing but shorts.

76
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:37,000
2009 he completed a full marathon
above the polar circle and Finland in

77
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:39,940
temperatures close to
negative 20 degrees Celsius.

78
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,740
Again dressed and nothing but shorts.

79
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,560
He holds the Guinness World
record for the longest ice bath,

80
00:04:44,561 --> 00:04:48,310
which is around at one hour, 53 minutes
and 12 seconds, but it's not just cold.

81
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:51,670
He has run full marathons in the
Namib Desert without any water.

82
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:56,140
He has also had toxins injected into
himself under doctor supervision and

83
00:04:56,141 --> 00:05:00,010
demonstrated that he can effectively
control his autonomic immune response.

84
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:01,700
This is crazy talk a,

85
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,740
these are things that fly in the face
of many textbooks and now he is featured

86
00:05:05,741 --> 00:05:10,180
in textbooks himself because he has
documented all of this and it's not just a

87
00:05:10,181 --> 00:05:13,680
whim specialty, he's not a mutant. Uh,

88
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,500
he is able to train others to achieve
many of these same effects and abilities

89
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:20,350
in some cases with just
four days of training.

90
00:05:20,351 --> 00:05:23,440
So we'll dig into all of this and more.
I loved this conversation.

91
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:26,620
He is a human Guinea pig
of human Guinea pigs.

92
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:29,770
Certainly it makes me feel like an
amateur. So without further ado,

93
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,620
please enjoy my
conversation with Wim Hoff.

94
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:37,660
Welcome to the show women.
I'm so pleased to have you.

95
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:41,320
Thank you for welcoming me.
Thank you very much.

96
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:46,330
I've been a fan for quite a few years
because we have, as we mentioned before,

97
00:05:46,331 --> 00:05:50,260
we started recording a mutual
friend in ray crow. Nice.

98
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,780
And he was in my second book.

99
00:05:52,781 --> 00:05:57,440
So I looked very closely at
cold exposure and of course you,

100
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:59,900
the ice man came up over and over again.

101
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:03,350
So it's really nice to
finally chat with you. It's,

102
00:06:03,351 --> 00:06:08,060
I feel like it's been a long time coming
and also had to pass guests or three

103
00:06:08,061 --> 00:06:12,770
past guests on this podcast, a Laird
Hamilton and Brian McKenzie and also,

104
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,940
um,
Gabby Reese,

105
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:19,370
Laird's wife who are big fans of your
methods and techniques who'd been

106
00:06:19,371 --> 00:06:23,840
practicing it. So they are, uh, you,
you have a lot, a lot of fans out there.

107
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:28,220
I'm sure listening as well. And I
thought we could just start with, uh,

108
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,580
your name. I've always loved
your name. Is Wim your full name?

109
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,860
Yes,
I am

110
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:35,550
in does that,

111
00:06:35,551 --> 00:06:38,700
it doesn't have any particular meaning
or how did your parents choose that name?

112
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:39,963
Wait,
ms,

113
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:45,170
a common name and a in
Holland in the Netherlands at,

114
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:47,450
but I looked it up and,
uh,

115
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:52,160
it says it's the protector of the people,
you know,

116
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:56,420
any name has got some logical, uh, uh,

117
00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:00,740
roots to with my name is,
uh, the protector of people.

118
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:02,240
My brother's name.
Who Was it?

119
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:05,980
My twin brother is Andray Andre on phone,

120
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:08,510
say a Andrei.
Andrew.

121
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,820
Andrew is the protector of goods.
So who's better?

122
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:14,660
I don't know.

123
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:18,710
I suppose, I suppose you need
both types of protection, right?

124
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,320
You have a such a fascinating story
and you have a lot of accolades,

125
00:07:24,321 --> 00:07:29,300
a lot of records. I think more than 20
world records at this point it seems,

126
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:33,020
uh, what was the first
world record that you said

127
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:36,210
at first was in Paris?
Uh,

128
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:40,340
just staying or half hour
in a immersed and ice.

129
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:45,920
And uh, 12 days later I repeated, uh, uh,

130
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:46,820
the record time.

131
00:07:46,821 --> 00:07:51,821
I make it a Ma Ma made it a an
hour in a Hollywood actually.

132
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:56,130
Yes. And I saw one also, I
mean, you've, you've been,

133
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,200
you spend a lot of time in
ice baths and I've, uh, uh,

134
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,510
largely influenced by you and a
handful of other people. Tim Noakes,

135
00:08:03,511 --> 00:08:07,650
ray and a huge fan of ice baths in
my fans. Always complained about it.

136
00:08:07,651 --> 00:08:10,910
But I've seen you in so
many containers full of ice.

137
00:08:10,911 --> 00:08:14,010
I saw one where it looks like there
was a lot of Chinese or Japanese in the

138
00:08:14,011 --> 00:08:16,440
background. Uh, what is,

139
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:20,520
what has been the most
challenging cold exposure, uh,

140
00:08:20,521 --> 00:08:23,820
experience that you've had,
whether it's for records or anything else?

141
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,440
Maybe,
uh,

142
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:30,900
losing my sight while I was
swimming underneath, Eh,

143
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,960
a eyes deck of a almost one
meter and I had no goggles on.

144
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:42,480
So a lot of side at 35 meters,
something like a 40 yards.

145
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:46,830
And uh, I lost the whole and uh, yeah,

146
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:51,100
I think it's like she, she had
happened, it happened over there, right.

147
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:56,340
That Meta eyes, that above. So, uh, yeah,

148
00:08:56,341 --> 00:09:01,200
that was some great experience.
And another one was, uh, losing my,

149
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,910
uh, way, uh,

150
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:07,970
on Mount Everest in shorts and
a at a like 18,000 feet in a,

151
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,050
in a blizzard, in a, like a wideout.

152
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,120
So things like that happen. Yeah.
And uh, they are challenging,

153
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:22,080
but then it throws me back to,
you know,

154
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:27,030
the depth of myself to a, which is
trust and confidence in, I got it.

155
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:31,290
What do you say to yourself in one of
those moments? So I guess physiologically,

156
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:32,124
did your,

157
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:37,400
did your retinas just freeze or when you
were swimming under the ice deck in a

158
00:09:37,921 --> 00:09:42,170
moment like that, when many people would
panic? I mean, did you panic? If, so,

159
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:46,470
what was the mental self talk when
you realize that was happening?

160
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:50,070
Very interesting. This,
the stress level at the,

161
00:09:50,071 --> 00:09:53,760
at that moment is absent,
is not there.

162
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:58,020
I'm dealing with the situation. Um, Eh,

163
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:02,160
it has been shown in the
university that our stress levels,

164
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,780
their stress hormone levels
are able to be raised,

165
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:07,800
eh,

166
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,800
lying in bed more than somebody in fear
for the first time going into a bungee

167
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,753
jump.

168
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,680
Oh, go and do a better job doing a
bunch of jump for the first time.

169
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,630
Yeah. Yeah. But not me by because the
bang, the jump, yeah, you're attached.

170
00:10:24,631 --> 00:10:29,310
But very unexpected situations in,
in nature,

171
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:33,680
like a blizzard or swimming
beneath the ice and uh,

172
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,680
losing a, the whole, because
your eyesight is gone.

173
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:41,340
Things like that. Or uh,
climbing without gear,

174
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:45,300
steep mountains and uh,
having cramps.

175
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,710
And what do you do at that moment?
That,

176
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:53,700
that's exactly what I learned,
how to raise consciously,

177
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:57,660
the stress hormone level,
purely controlled.

178
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:02,780
And I'm able to deal with the situation
at that moment without panicking.

179
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:08,420
And I think that's one of the crucial
findings which could benefit for human

180
00:11:09,361 --> 00:11:11,250
mankind as it is,
you know,

181
00:11:11,251 --> 00:11:15,600
a very subjected to a stress all the time.
Panicking,

182
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,790
having fair and all that.

183
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,210
And I learned in nature
how to deal with that.

184
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,430
And the cold brought me, uh, but uh,

185
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,980
brought me that science brought me
that, uh, knowledge, wisdom actually

186
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:32,450
and the, the raising
of stress hormones. So,

187
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:37,600
so controlling something that has long
been thought to be part of the autonomous

188
00:11:38,211 --> 00:11:40,610
nervous system, something that
you have no control over. Right.

189
00:11:40,611 --> 00:11:43,010
And we'll get to the breathing because
breathing is very interesting since it's

190
00:11:43,011 --> 00:11:45,050
both autonomous,
but you can,

191
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:49,320
you can consciously control it and
practice different methods. Uh,

192
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:53,090
I think it was, it was certainly in the
vice documentary that recently came,

193
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:55,270
which I recommend to everyone and
I'll link to in the show notes,

194
00:11:55,271 --> 00:12:00,190
but was it in 2011 that you were injected
with some type of virus or bacteria?

195
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:04,390
To see if you could control the
immune response that was at the Dutch.

196
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:08,170
I'm going to mispronounce this,
the Radboud University, exactly.

197
00:12:08,171 --> 00:12:10,450
Wrap out to university in Holland,

198
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:16,530
a intensive care nuclear
science. I, uh, underwent a,

199
00:12:16,531 --> 00:12:21,531
an experiment and they injected me with
the endo talk scene with that toxin

200
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:23,710
actually,

201
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:28,710
which is a part of a bacteria
and that creates a very dramatic,

202
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:31,620
a immune response.

203
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:37,070
And as we have no control over
the immune response in our body,

204
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:42,950
they thought I was not able to do with
as well as expected because nobody showed

205
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:46,590
to be able to serve,

206
00:12:46,591 --> 00:12:51,591
press the immune response because it is
part of the autonomic nervous system.

207
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:57,120
And uh,
nobody is able to do that until now.

208
00:12:57,121 --> 00:13:02,121
I showed that I was very able within
a quarter of hour instead of ours,

209
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:06,870
uh, suffering from
uncontrolled shivering, fever,

210
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:12,110
headaches and all that, uh, I
show within a quarter of our, uh,

211
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:17,150
to have a control complete
over the symptoms and uh,

212
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,740
also decide to kins which is our,

213
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,920
which are the flammatory beings and the
blood created by the immune response.

214
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:30,770
And I showed in the blood and by blood
results to suppress them dramatically,

215
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,550
uh, within a quarter.
Then they told me, okay,

216
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:41,060
but you are an exception that
confirms the rule because you yeah,

217
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,030
yeah.
You have been trainings so many years.

218
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:49,260
You are the iceman,
you do exceptional features,

219
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:54,560
but nobody is able to do that without
that proper training of so many years.

220
00:13:56,190 --> 00:14:00,120
And I told him no,
I can train them within 10 days.

221
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:06,170
And then the professor was
really challenged because
if this group would show to

222
00:14:07,501 --> 00:14:11,610
be able within 10 days, uh, to uh,

223
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:16,640
be able to influence deeply into the
autonomous nervous system related to the

224
00:14:17,011 --> 00:14:18,000
immune system,

225
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:23,670
then that's for the first time
in the scientific history. So,

226
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:24,960
but he,

227
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:29,960
he saw the indication of the possibility
but still thought those guys are not

228
00:14:31,801 --> 00:14:36,120
going to be able to do that
within 10 days. You know what,

229
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:39,000
Eh,
it wasn't within 10 days.

230
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:44,030
It wasn't with four days of training
that I made them able to undergo the same

231
00:14:46,021 --> 00:14:51,021
experiments that that means that the
injection of the endotoxin and have them

232
00:14:52,701 --> 00:14:57,701
within a quarter of hour
completely control over their
immune system related to

233
00:14:59,151 --> 00:15:00,680
the autonomous nervous system.

234
00:15:00,681 --> 00:15:05,681
So they showed a hundred percent score
of everybody to be able within a couple

235
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:14,020
of days to go to tap into the autonomous
nervous system related to the immune

236
00:15:14,721 --> 00:15:16,880
system and yeah,

237
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:21,290
and the training about a
trading be a prior to it,

238
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,160
Eh, we add our beers,
you know, in the evening.

239
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:30,340
And there are a lot of music and
very relaxed and their mindset.

240
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:36,770
I said, I guys, uh, probably, uh, you, uh,

241
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,620
you guys are the new gladiators,
Eh,

242
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:44,540
where we are going to
win the worst war ever,

243
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:49,490
which, uh, produced, uh, much, uh,

244
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:53,990
the most casualties,
agony, pain and all that.

245
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,530
And that's the bacteria that's the back.

246
00:15:56,531 --> 00:16:01,490
So that's the virus and we gonna
win this war. Are you with me?

247
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:06,200
I, that's the way I talked to
them. And so they had a mindset.

248
00:16:06,201 --> 00:16:11,180
So in the evening we had a relaxed, they,
it was like a hippie movement and the,

249
00:16:11,181 --> 00:16:16,181
but this is a new revolution
at in four days time.

250
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:21,850
They were able at the fourth day
without prior experience in the cold,

251
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:28,300
they were able to go in
shorts at bye bye minus stand.

252
00:16:29,691 --> 00:16:34,400
That's about, I dunno, Eh,
uh, Fahrenheit Celsius.

253
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:38,900
This a selfie.
I mean it's freezing all in the twenties.

254
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:43,390
Yes, in one. And then, uh,

255
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:48,640
for hours and hours we were going up
hill and up to mountain and we arrived at

256
00:16:50,601 --> 00:16:55,601
the summit after hours and it
was minus 27 minus 27 Celsius.

257
00:16:56,830 --> 00:17:01,460
That that is more than a minus.
And then twenties,

258
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,430
it's probably 10 or so,
something like that.

259
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,570
And we danced to Harlem Shaygo there.

260
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,130
Then I knew these guys,

261
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:15,430
these guys are ready in four days time
when they will be internalized in the,

262
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:21,500
in the hospital and uh,
and injected with the endotoxin.

263
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:26,690
They will be able because I
feel when somebody is, uh,

264
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,720
back into its natural state of his or
hers physiology and I know how to do that,

265
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:39,330
the cold trade me, they called
is my teacher. And with the,

266
00:17:39,331 --> 00:17:44,270
with the subjects, I'm so curious
to ask because, uh, the, uh,

267
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:48,980
I mean I am certainly not as proficient
as you are in any of these techniques,

268
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:49,920
but I've,
I've

269
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:54,330
enjoyed experimenting over the last
10 years in writing about these short

270
00:17:54,331 --> 00:17:58,110
experiments, whether it's related to
breath holding with David Blaine or, or,

271
00:17:58,111 --> 00:18:01,710
or other aspects. Um, obviously
you're a professional and I am not,

272
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:07,050
but I'm so I'd be very curious to hear
you perhaps elaborate for instance,

273
00:18:07,051 --> 00:18:10,100
on the first day of training
with these subjects bef uh,

274
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:14,490
in preparation to be injected
four days later. Sure. Uh,

275
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,370
what did the first day of
training look like for them?

276
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:21,830
Um,
just in the morning at ease.

277
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:25,040
At eight o'clock without food intake,

278
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:29,960
we do a breathing and they
lie on the ground. Oh.

279
00:18:29,961 --> 00:18:32,960
Because that's the most relaxed pose.

280
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:36,590
And uh,
if you are relaxed,

281
00:18:36,591 --> 00:18:40,160
you are able to store up a hold mode.
Oh,

282
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:45,220
a lot more oxygen than when
intention or in post you.

283
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:49,400
So I say it a it just lay down and relax.

284
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,880
Now we are going to begin just
breathe in deeply and let go.

285
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,870
Breathe in deeply. Let
go, make it a rhythm.

286
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:03,630
Breathe in deeply.
Let go,

287
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:08,670
not fully out but fully and and let go.

288
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:13,230
And uh,
where you repeat that about 30,

289
00:19:13,231 --> 00:19:16,470
40 times until nice indication.

290
00:19:16,471 --> 00:19:21,471
So symptoms a comma by and
that it means lightheadedness.

291
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,290
Okay.

292
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:28,210
Loose and the body feeling loose
in the body. Tingling contractions.

293
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:32,020
That's because carbon dioxide goes out.

294
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:37,980
Oxygen is a roaming freely through
the body and the Ph levels,

295
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,390
rice,
they are up to me.

296
00:19:41,391 --> 00:19:46,391
Lysed so they get to their
best condition and uh,

297
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:51,970
that's proven, that's
proven. And they saw a,

298
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:55,240
when we do this, uh, they, so they,

299
00:19:55,241 --> 00:20:00,241
so all these results chemically then
once you feel positively charged with all

300
00:20:02,441 --> 00:20:05,200
the symptoms of lightheadedness,
feeling loose,

301
00:20:05,201 --> 00:20:09,250
contractions and tingling
in the buddy asked him,

302
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:13,780
just breathe in deeply, let
go. And now the last time,

303
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,840
breathe in deeply and had to go after
letting go after exhalations stop,

304
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:25,510
reframe from breathing.
There is no need.

305
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:30,990
We get a whole lot of oxygen and a
measurement devices are not able to detect

306
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:36,910
how much it's more than a hundred
percent that's my opinion.

307
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:41,110
But devices still are
not able to detect that.

308
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:45,940
They only can go up to a
hundred percent as an essay,

309
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:51,210
but there are a hundred the body is
able to store up more oxygen than

310
00:20:51,341 --> 00:20:55,960
measurement devices have
now are able to uh, measure.

311
00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:01,290
So then after one and a half minutes,
Eh,

312
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:06,400
then you see that the measurement
device shows 100% and then it goes

313
00:21:06,401 --> 00:21:10,390
dramatically down afterwards.
And you're using a pulse oximeter,

314
00:21:10,391 --> 00:21:13,800
like something that you clip
on your, yes, Paul's ex.

315
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:16,510
So you need a heart beat,

316
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:21,660
you have a heartbeat and you have the
saturation of the oxygen in inside the

317
00:21:22,211 --> 00:21:24,310
blood.
So the amount of oxygen,

318
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:29,910
so after one and a half minute GC with
everybody that the saturation of the

319
00:21:30,551 --> 00:21:33,130
blood is going down a,
you know,

320
00:21:33,131 --> 00:21:37,630
people is CLPD that that's
lung diseases and all that.

321
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:42,130
They, they suffer from real severe.
See your per diem. When they have 85,

322
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:47,410
we go to 90 to 80, 70, 60,

323
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,000
50, people die at 50 and 40, uh,

324
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:56,230
40% saturation in the blood.
We go past,

325
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:01,780
we get, we'll go even to 30. And
then the device measurement device,

326
00:22:01,781 --> 00:22:05,770
the accumulator shuts down.
It is not measuring animal,

327
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:09,370
but we even go past that one.
Now why don't you,

328
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,840
why don't the subjects pass out at
this point? They don't pass out,

329
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:18,000
eh, because they are
outlined. I say they're,

330
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:23,110
the Ph degrees, eh, are
really perfect at that moment.

331
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,450
And in,

332
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:28,360
instead of a person who's
dying is very acidic.

333
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:33,490
So that's the difference. So,
uh, because we are so alkaline,

334
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:38,500
people maybe sometimes
are able to pass out,

335
00:22:38,501 --> 00:22:43,050
but just two seconds or three
seconds because they get, uh,

336
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,040
they are out of their conditioned control,
eh,

337
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:51,730
but, uh, in a, in a, you
know, after exercising,

338
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:53,860
they have a re a regained,

339
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:58,750
not only control in those moments
and in those situations they,

340
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:02,410
uh,
they win a new part in the brain.

341
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:06,220
They get a very deep in the
brain and it's all new terrain.

342
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:11,260
It's like baby a baby has no
problem with, uh, with our legs.

343
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:16,390
But there are no metorik
motorical neurones to the legs,

344
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,700
yes.
Tab.

345
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:23,380
So we are going into different
parts of the brain where there is,

346
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:26,210
where the guy or the, the, the, uh,

347
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:28,810
the girl that has been,

348
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,800
so it's logic that the
people are able to pass out,

349
00:23:32,801 --> 00:23:36,310
but nothing happens
because they are alkaline.

350
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:40,630
So they just wake up and mostly eh,

351
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:45,690
or mostly almost always they wake up very
happy and it's like a drug experience.

352
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:53,960
So, but that's besides of
the real effect, um, uh,

353
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:56,150
trying to, uh, not, not try,

354
00:23:56,630 --> 00:24:01,630
which we showed scientifically is to be
able to tap into the immune system in

355
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:08,330
all the layers.
Those are three layers and normally,

356
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:12,620
eh, we are not able to get into
the second and the third layer.

357
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,030
And I say,

358
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:19,090
now we have found a key to the second
and the third layer that means the

359
00:24:21,051 --> 00:24:26,051
nonspecific immune system and the
specific adaptive immune system.

360
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:32,050
And that makes us looking to disease
completely different because our abilities

361
00:24:32,781 --> 00:24:37,610
so much more. And, uh,
uh, we have been, um,

362
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,940
uh, publishing, uh, people in Boston.

363
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:45,970
They published it throughout America on
the university's chapter 22 on biology

364
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:48,194
now.

365
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:53,410
And it tells that we have tapped into
the autonomous nervous system into the

366
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:57,320
eight innate immune system,

367
00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:00,980
which was up til now,
not possible.

368
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:06,280
And we did at 100% with a group of nine
people showing that they were very able

369
00:25:07,581 --> 00:25:09,070
to do it,
all,

370
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:14,110
all of them within a quarter of an hour
and have spectacular results so that it

371
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:21,710
is science now and now it needs to get
to every person in the world how to tap

372
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:28,330
into the deeper layers of our
physiology without training,

373
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:28,970
you know,

374
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:33,970
years and years and years and
being Joe Gibbs or being a,

375
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:37,130
the super athletes and all that,
no,

376
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,250
my aim within a couple of days,

377
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:45,460
we are all able to tap into the deepest
layers of our physiology and reset our

378
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:49,130
immune system,

379
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:54,110
bring it under our will and that's my aim.

380
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:58,130
But then we make farm to and all that.

381
00:25:58,131 --> 00:26:02,000
But for say being serious,
that's my goal.

382
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:05,810
Right. No, I was just going to say,
I mean it's very hard to get the,

383
00:26:05,811 --> 00:26:08,050
I think you're approaching it in a
very intelligent way because it's,

384
00:26:08,051 --> 00:26:11,690
it's very hard to get truly serious work
done if you're serious all the time.

385
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:14,750
So yeah,
I enjoy it.

386
00:26:14,751 --> 00:26:19,751
It's very fascinating for me as a teacher
to watch how you coach your subjects

387
00:26:21,291 --> 00:26:25,450
because you use beer,
you have guitar and uh,

388
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:29,660
I think it's very important component.
Um, it, it would seem to be,

389
00:26:29,661 --> 00:26:33,440
and I wanted to ask you about the
breathing on day one, just one more time,

390
00:26:33,441 --> 00:26:34,660
which is,
is,

391
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:39,710
is the breathing exercise
on day one something that
then the subjects use during

392
00:26:41,751 --> 00:26:46,751
the injection or before the injection or
is it an exercise to prove to them that

393
00:26:47,131 --> 00:26:50,430
they can do more than they think they
can do and it's more of a confidence

394
00:26:50,431 --> 00:26:54,750
builder that you use to set the
tone for the rest of the training?

395
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,033
Yes.

396
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:02,020
So it's a confidence builder and is very
effective at the moment when something,

397
00:27:02,701 --> 00:27:03,180
uh,

398
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:08,180
like an injection has come in and they
know it will result in dramatic a immune

399
00:27:09,091 --> 00:27:14,091
response and they have to build up
and make alert their shield or are

400
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,020
protective, uh, uh, alliance of, uh,

401
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:25,110
of defense, which is the immune
system. Yes. So both, both.

402
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:30,240
And is this something that you can do
after the fact? So for instance, uh,

403
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:35,350
at this point with your, uh,
your level of proficiency,

404
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:40,600
if you were to contract a disease
without realizing it and then to get very

405
00:27:40,601 --> 00:27:40,961
sick,

406
00:27:40,961 --> 00:27:45,961
would you be able to reverse that or
is it something that needs to be a,

407
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:46,930
is that she,

408
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:50,980
does the shield need to
be activated beforehand in
order for you to control that

409
00:27:50,981 --> 00:27:53,710
autonomous,
so-called autonomous response?

410
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:56,530
Interesting.
Very nice.

411
00:27:56,820 --> 00:28:00,040
[inaudible] it's both
preventive and healing.

412
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:05,820
So once a specific hormone or a
molecule must be generated to get to a,

413
00:28:09,371 --> 00:28:10,390
an uh,
an,

414
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,410
an invader nonself invader in the body,

415
00:28:14,411 --> 00:28:17,530
which could be a bacteria,
a virus, or a back sell,

416
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:22,720
which got through the
first two lines of defense.

417
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,230
Then the third line is more specific,

418
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:31,500
but it takes normally like weeks or
sometimes it's not traceable because uh,

419
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:37,180
Eh, an invader is mutated. But uh,

420
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:39,480
we have now,
uh,

421
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:44,550
a method that is able to tap into the
third layer and make the nuns are the

422
00:28:45,701 --> 00:28:49,950
specific adaptive immune system,
uh,

423
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:54,670
rapidly active even
after something comes in.

424
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:59,560
So it's both a preventive,
uh,

425
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:03,250
but is also when you feel you become sick,
so a,

426
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:08,490
an invader has gotten in then you are
still a very able to restore the balance

427
00:29:10,001 --> 00:29:11,470
with it. Got It. Yes.

428
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:16,910
And um, the, if we're looking at the,

429
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:22,090
the explanation that the scientists have
at this point for your ability and your

430
00:29:23,391 --> 00:29:27,410
subject's ability to protect
themselves or shield themselves, uh,

431
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:31,820
it seemed like one hypothesis was
you being able to increase I think

432
00:29:31,821 --> 00:29:35,210
noradrenaline or norepinephrine
levels in the body. Uh,

433
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:39,080
do you agree with that or do
you think there are other, uh,

434
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:42,000
do you have other series?
I

435
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,100
do, I do. I'd love to hear it.

436
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:49,490
It's like if you have HIV and I'm,

437
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:54,210
the immune system is still looking
for answers up till a moment.

438
00:29:54,211 --> 00:29:58,920
That it is not able to specify
anymore what's going on.

439
00:29:58,921 --> 00:30:01,730
And then we get aids, eh, that,

440
00:30:01,731 --> 00:30:06,090
that means that all the
defense systems are shut down.

441
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:11,870
Now we have shown by nor a
benefit print and no adrenaline,

442
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:15,380
adrenaline, eh, that we can, uh, uh,

443
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:20,390
suppress the inflammation that means
the flammatory bodies and creating an

444
00:30:20,701 --> 00:30:23,850
immune response and we suppressed it.

445
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:29,420
That would be like a shutting down
the immune system that makes us,

446
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,400
uh,

447
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:36,860
following the scientific logic
that makes us more vulnerable.

448
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:41,880
No what we do.
And they still got to find out.

449
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:46,940
But I just use my natural logic
and you can read a poem in the,

450
00:30:47,551 --> 00:30:49,620
in the, in the, in the papers

451
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:56,150
that we have found a way
to awaken the third line,

452
00:30:56,610 --> 00:31:01,350
which normally takes weeks or months to,
uh,

453
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:06,240
to, uh, find the specific hormone
or molecule, which Dan is,

454
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:08,450
uh, going, uh, for,

455
00:31:08,451 --> 00:31:12,790
or the target cell to go
on the membrane and to Eh,

456
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:17,100
kill this out. So That's interesting. It's
almost like internal drug development.

457
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:20,850
You're trying to find the lock that, I'm
sorry, the key that fits the proper lock,

458
00:31:20,851 --> 00:31:22,910
but you're doing it internally.
Yeah.

459
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:27,440
Normally it takes a very long
time biologically to, to,

460
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:32,560
to uh, sort of, uh, to conclude with. But
you're accelerating that process. Exactly.

461
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:32,710
Yeah.

462
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:37,710
And then days our bones are not needed
anymore because there's specific hormone,

463
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:39,290
there's specific,

464
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:44,260
a molecule gets on the cell
membrane and then all this, uh,

465
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,800
uh, like fire, uh, people, uh,

466
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:53,130
which is nor adrenaline gets through out
the system and a pen offering as well.

467
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:59,380
And they suppress the
inflammation, the action. And uh,

468
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:04,410
but that is only possible when the
target is already a annihilated when the

469
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:12,360
target has a specific molecule on it
because of the third line of defense.

470
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:15,880
Right. And that's that,
that's what we found.

471
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:20,910
We found a way and its ultimate Dr
Kevin Tracey from Manhasset New York who

472
00:32:21,161 --> 00:32:25,480
tells them he is very much easier
now authority in the biochemistry.

473
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:27,720
And uh,

474
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:31,590
I worked with him in 2007 and I showed,

475
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:35,840
I was able in is a institute,
uh,

476
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:40,430
to suppress or to
influence the vague nerve,

477
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:45,230
which is the Vegas nerve.
Yeah. Yes. And now, uh,

478
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,120
he told in nature,

479
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:52,930
he told immunity does not
come without neuro regulation.

480
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:57,500
They found a way.

481
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:01,710
So what do you now, for
instance, I was a, I did my, uh,

482
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,590
undergraduate for a very
short period of time. Uh,

483
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:06,350
in college I studied neuroscience.

484
00:33:06,351 --> 00:33:09,920
And I remember when I was in college,

485
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:14,000
there was a professor there who
determined that for instance,

486
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:18,620
the neurons in the hippocampus
could actually be regenerated.

487
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:19,850
And this was very,
very big,

488
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:23,600
big news because people had assumed for
a very long time in a number of parts of

489
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:28,140
the brain that neurons could not
be degenerated or regenerated.

490
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:29,480
Basically as you got older,

491
00:33:29,481 --> 00:33:32,540
you just lost neuro neuronal function
and it could not be restored.

492
00:33:32,541 --> 00:33:35,560
Now we know that's not true.
Right? And so you're having this,

493
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:39,440
a similar experience where you are
proving to people that things are possible

494
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:43,040
that were thought impossible.
What, what do you think,

495
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:48,290
what other impossibles do you think we
will prove our possible in the next say,

496
00:33:48,291 --> 00:33:51,620
five years in your kind of
area of experimentation?

497
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:56,950
Very, very nice. A very good question. Uh,

498
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:59,190
I think depression for example,

499
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:04,790
and the brace itself and we are able to
tap into the brain's and do so much more

500
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:11,120
influence. So much more, uh, uh,

501
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:16,190
which is related to the
hypothalamus and the pineal gland,

502
00:34:16,441 --> 00:34:20,760
the pituitary gland, the hippocampus
and the Amygdala, the seed of emotion.

503
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:26,040
All these are part and
around the brainstem,

504
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:29,640
which is the reptilian brain,
the primitive brain.

505
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:35,090
And because of our comfort
way of living and behavior,

506
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:40,350
Eh, this part doesn't
get enough a stimulation,

507
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:43,090
right? Got untrained. Yes.

508
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:46,780
That doesn't get the
stimulation nor oxygen.

509
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:52,110
So there is a certain kind of
deregulating p h level we are going on.

510
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:58,720
It's just to a lack of oxygen.
There is no action, no stimulation.

511
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:03,790
So in time it begins to malfunction.
And that's uh,

512
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:07,210
yeah, that's actually a,
yeah, sort of a logic.

513
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:12,660
So we suffer from a whole lot par example
of depression in the Western world

514
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:17,850
because, uh, because we
go too much into, uh, the,

515
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:22,780
the NEOCORTEX, the, the
superficial brain, the new brain,

516
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:28,140
and we have to do all kinds of things
and that at that lines and worries and we

517
00:35:28,301 --> 00:35:31,450
cannot stop it and it
consumes all the energy.

518
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:36,870
What I do and learn is to
go into the brainstem again.

519
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:42,430
They said that the simplicity
of our reptilian brain,

520
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:44,840
the primitive brain,
the brainstem,

521
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:49,410
which is related to all these
beautiful eh, glance over that,

522
00:35:49,411 --> 00:35:54,210
which is the pineal gland, pituitary
gland and the, and the controller of ours,

523
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:59,330
which is the hypothalamus and
the seat of emotion itself,

524
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:04,290
which is the Amygdala.
It's all there.

525
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:09,410
And so I found a way to get into that
and show just by this example of hours to

526
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,510
lying in bed,

527
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:20,750
people are able to produce more adrenaline
than somebody who is in fear going

528
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:29,280
into a bungee jump for the first time.
You see what I mean?

529
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,780
That that means fair emotion,

530
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:39,180
uncontrollable emotions and fear.
We are able to control that.

531
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:44,210
And that's because we tap controlled
into the brainstem and produce any

532
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:50,850
adrenaline or epinephrine
or, uh, all these,

533
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:56,070
all these, uh, uh, gland, uh,
now not plants hormones we need.

534
00:36:56,310 --> 00:37:01,240
And it's the pineal gland
in the, in the finally, uh,

535
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:04,740
which is the control of all
the other glands in our body.

536
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:09,060
So we are able now to tap into that.
So the coming five years,

537
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:14,340
I want to eradicate a depression.
I want to eradicate,

538
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:18,600
Eh, the, the, Eh, yeah,
actually a disease.

539
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:23,610
I know a big words, but we are
into that. I'm not only into,

540
00:37:23,611 --> 00:37:25,660
that is a also professors,

541
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:30,680
biochemists who stamp my point
and they see it's so simple,

542
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,380
so accessible and so effective.

543
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:39,860
But it needs to be translated into our
infrastructure of a thinking as well as

544
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:45,900
of interests.
But it needs to cooperate with schooling.

545
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:49,080
Now we got on a university that's nice.

546
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:51,210
It's coming top down because our,

547
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:55,980
if the US universities are
taking it on than soon,

548
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,140
all the universities and
the world will follow.

549
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:03,750
So we find the, okay,
I rest my 0.4 for now

550
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:09,110
and with the, uh, so with,
for instance, depression.

551
00:38:09,111 --> 00:38:13,310
So there, I'm sure there are a lot
of people listening who have, uh,

552
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:15,680
bouts with depression or
even extended depression.

553
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:20,950
Yes. No control over their mood,
right? No control over the brainstem.

554
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:23,110
Right?
So let's break it back to the brainstem,

555
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,770
right? So, for instance, you know,

556
00:38:24,771 --> 00:38:29,771
I find that it's very helpful for
me at least to use cold exposure.

557
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:36,040
And whether that's cold
showers or ice bath, uh, it

558
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,860
has a tremendous mood
elevating effect or maybe mood,

559
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,870
a balancing effect that depending
on on how we want to explain it.

560
00:38:43,871 --> 00:38:46,360
But for someone who is feeling depressed,

561
00:38:46,361 --> 00:38:50,500
what are some simple things that you
would recommend that they try potentially

562
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:56,860
get into conscious breathing,
deeper breathing,

563
00:38:56,861 --> 00:39:00,680
and be consciously doing that?
Uh,

564
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:05,680
it showed in the university
that I was able just, you know,

565
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:10,920
about consciousness just by thinking
that I was going into an experiment.

566
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:15,430
I raised sell on cell level,

567
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:20,900
the metabolic activity in the cell with
300% just by thinking that our minds,

568
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,780
so our mind should be with
people who are depressed.

569
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:31,660
They just got lost.
They have no control.

570
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:36,661
So they have to regain control by
consciously going into breathing.

571
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:43,610
Breathing brings about deeper breathing,
uh,

572
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:48,790
brings about a better ph level in
the body, but not only in the body.

573
00:39:48,791 --> 00:39:51,250
Also in the mind and the,
Eh,

574
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:56,340
the right Ph level will
make the neurotransmitters.

575
00:39:57,490 --> 00:40:01,360
That's your mind, eh,
electrical signals, finally,

576
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,490
uh,
work better.

577
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:08,920
And then you are able to do or learn
to direct these neurotransmitters or

578
00:40:08,921 --> 00:40:12,470
thoughts the mind itself,
uh,

579
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:17,150
consciously with the
right Ph degree. So, Eh,

580
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:22,500
we make it simple and we say conscious
breathing all the time cause you lost

581
00:40:23,531 --> 00:40:25,720
track and it takes energy.

582
00:40:25,721 --> 00:40:30,721
It takes your mind and you got to bring
back your mind under your control.

583
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:33,573
And uh,

584
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,860
I mean this I think is related to a
broader topic of compulsive behavior,

585
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,131
right?

586
00:40:39,131 --> 00:40:44,131
Or people who have automatic
behaviors that are not serving them.

587
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:48,190
And one of those is oftentimes
eating or overeating.

588
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:49,660
And before we started recording,

589
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:54,010
I asked you what you had for breakfast
and he said nothing because you eat once

590
00:40:54,011 --> 00:40:58,780
per day. So I could you describe
what your daily eating ritual is?

591
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:04,680
I eat after six o'clock in the afternoon
and that's already for 35 years.

592
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:07,570
And there is,

593
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:12,690
I got a lot of energy and you know
why you have a lot of allergies now?

594
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:17,800
Energy. Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry. Cut It.
Maybe allergies as well. Women, you know,

595
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:23,000
uh, okay, just to make fine.

596
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:30,630
Thank you. And I have to have
wine next time we do this thing.

597
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:35,680
He's very outdated. How
are you? Good. Uh, Eh,

598
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:39,620
the thing is by better
breathing conscious breathing,

599
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:44,150
you made this chemical process in the,
in the cell happened,

600
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:48,580
which is called aerobic dissimilation.
And as a,

601
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:53,600
in the cell production to make energy,
mitochondrial energy,

602
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:55,160
you need food.

603
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,930
But if you are able to
influence by better breathing,

604
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,580
a deeper breathing,

605
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:06,940
then you produce simple metabolic
activity in the Mitochondria by better

606
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:10,760
breathing.
And that creates energy,

607
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:13,520
which was the purpose of food.

608
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:18,290
So food is nice. Hello? I'm here.

609
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:21,770
Oh yeah, food is nice. Food is great.

610
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:26,980
You should do it with a lot of love and
they're having a nice time making it and

611
00:42:26,981 --> 00:42:30,950
the, because that's the energy
you get finally a altar,

612
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:36,190
but eh, Eh, Eh, like uh, me, uh,

613
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,270
uh,
it's a sort of a fast,

614
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:41,780
but I have to feel your hear
the scientists really gets,

615
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:47,260
are going to be much more effective and
the cell activity is going to be much

616
00:42:49,011 --> 00:42:54,011
more effective and it is using all the
food and you can eat after six o'clock.

617
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:58,950
I can eat what I want the
other day I'm slim again.

618
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:02,810
And that's making, you
know, making the bodywork.

619
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:08,090
But as we eat all the day long,
the body is not shutting down.

620
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:11,270
It's not effective.
Animal doesn't go deep,

621
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:15,680
doesn't go into survival mode
is it's not natural again.

622
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:20,950
So it's beginning to store up all the
fats because it doesn't know what to do

623
00:43:21,141 --> 00:43:26,060
anymore because the deeper mechanisms
are not working anymore. So.

624
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:27,740
Yeah.
And how to bring that.

625
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:29,380
And what do you usually,
what do,

626
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:32,960
what are some typical meals
that you have after 6:00 PM

627
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:36,990
that uh, uh, I like pasta

628
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:44,190
and I like a couple of beers too.
Yeah,

629
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:48,630
sounds good. I, uh, the eating
rituals are interesting.

630
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:52,770
I've interviewed a number of people on
this podcast including General Stanley

631
00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:56,840
McChrystal is a four star general
and he was, he's also famous for, um,

632
00:43:56,940 --> 00:44:00,630
getting a lot of exercise early in
the day and eating one meal per day.

633
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:04,920
He's also, he's also very
well known for that. Uh, you,

634
00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:08,900
you described the breathing exercise,
uh,

635
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:10,770
some of the breathing
exercises that you do.

636
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:15,550
Does the type of breathing
that you do have anything, uh,

637
00:44:16,830 --> 00:44:21,420
is it similar in any ways to holotropic
breathwork? If you're familiar with that?

638
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:25,980
And I heard from someone,

639
00:44:25,981 --> 00:44:30,000
and maybe you can correct me if I'm wrong,
that some scientists had looked at,

640
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:31,590
at whether were

641
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:36,810
producing or releasing more
DMT during some of your,

642
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:38,370
uh,
breathing activities.

643
00:44:38,371 --> 00:44:41,580
Is that accurate or did I get
some misinformation from someone?

644
00:44:41,581 --> 00:44:42,414
I'll just be very,

645
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:46,730
no, that's a professor who, right. Yeah.
I don't know. A Colorado, I don't know.

646
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:50,910
Uh, what is his name again? I don't,
I use a, I told her the, in the field,

647
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:56,350
but I had a dialogue with
him and he is talking about,

648
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:59,430
uh, uh, you know,

649
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:04,020
I a whiskey guy on the old drugs
and all this and experimenting.

650
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:08,280
And I said,
I told him I'm able to produce Eh,

651
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:09,240
to Eh,

652
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:14,270
trigger the pineal gland in
a way that DMT is released.

653
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:19,860
And uh, and yes, I can make
people very, very happy,

654
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:24,420
uh, doing, uh, oh, all these
breathing exercises that that's true.

655
00:45:24,421 --> 00:45:29,421
But the purpose of DMT actually is to
work out the subconscious wild dreaming.

656
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:35,610
And the rapid eye movement
sleep and the other one is, uh,

657
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:36,660
when you die,

658
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:42,200
then DMT is released as well as
to make it more a Yanno happy,

659
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:46,170
uh, going after, uh, having a, have a,

660
00:45:46,171 --> 00:45:48,930
have a nice time zone to the other side,
something like that.

661
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:53,370
So there is a natural purpose for DMT,
but we are,

662
00:45:53,730 --> 00:45:57,990
we are very,
I'm very able to trigger that a,

663
00:45:57,991 --> 00:46:00,870
that creates a DMT.
And I told him,

664
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:05,970
I told him [inaudible] it's
not only about the DMT,

665
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:10,730
which is very nice, it's a
nice drug and all that. But uh,

666
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:14,340
the better part of it
is if we are able to,

667
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:17,700
to trigger the pineal gland,

668
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:22,590
which is related directly to the
hypothalamus and the pituitary gland.

669
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:28,130
If we are able to trigger that one and
to decalcify because of our comfort way

670
00:46:28,981 --> 00:46:32,310
of living, uh, the, this pineal gland,

671
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:37,230
then this gland is able to,
to direct all the other glands.

672
00:46:37,231 --> 00:46:42,210
It's the only gland that is directing
all the other glands and we can bring,

673
00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:47,270
we can narrowly connect with it
without our neocortex is what we do.

674
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:54,830
And it shows them that we are able to
prevent from disease or bacteria coming in

675
00:46:56,460 --> 00:47:01,460
because we are able to
activate it much more directly.

676
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:07,010
Um, um, the, that's the main
purpose to, Ya know, uh,

677
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:12,140
looking different at what creates disease
is because of our pineal gland or the

678
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:18,410
brainstem is not really active animal
because it's neglected because of a

679
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:22,920
comfort style of living and behavior.

680
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:27,990
And we want to make a shortcut
and to show it that it is simple,

681
00:47:27,991 --> 00:47:29,580
accessible and effective.

682
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:31,620
Well, I think the, the, the,

683
00:47:31,621 --> 00:47:36,621
the comfort is important to underscore
because I was having a conversation with

684
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:40,600
Dean Karnazes several years ago.
He's a famous ultra marathoner.

685
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:44,140
You guys would probably have a lot
to talk about it. And uh, he, he, uh,

686
00:47:44,141 --> 00:47:48,670
he ran need a 50 marathons in 50 days in
50 states. He's one of those guys. And,

687
00:47:48,671 --> 00:47:50,930
um, he said that, uh,

688
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:56,110
he lives in northern California near San
Francisco where I live and he's in one

689
00:47:56,111 --> 00:47:58,870
of his lines and I'm, I'm, I might be
paraphrasing this, but he said, you know,

690
00:47:58,871 --> 00:48:03,871
people now they confuse being happy with
being comfortable and they think being

691
00:48:05,171 --> 00:48:10,030
comfortable is being happy, but that's,
those are not the same thing. And, uh,

692
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:15,790
I'd like to talk about discomfort for
a second. So you ran a marathon in,

693
00:48:15,791 --> 00:48:17,500
was it death valley with no water?

694
00:48:18,170 --> 00:48:20,310
Yes. Yeah. And that may be, yeah,

695
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:22,540
Namibia. That's right. Even so,

696
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:26,140
even more dangerous because
you have snakes and whatnot.

697
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:30,160
So is it possible to not,
so of course,

698
00:48:30,161 --> 00:48:32,170
when you are submerged in ice,

699
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:35,770
it's been demonstrated that you can
maintain your core body temperature for a

700
00:48:35,771 --> 00:48:37,920
very long period of time.
Uh,

701
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:41,470
is it possible for you to drop your body
temperature in a hot climate or have

702
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:41,890
you just,

703
00:48:41,890 --> 00:48:46,810
is it training yourself to
withstand the higher temperatures?

704
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:50,940
Yeah, that's exactly a boat. Actually.

705
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:56,170
Your tolerance is rising and that means
you are able to endure a whole lot more

706
00:48:58,801 --> 00:49:02,100
because you're able to
influence their hormonal system.

707
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:06,150
In a way that neutralizes pain signals.

708
00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:11,310
That's one. The other one is, uh,
because of my training in the cold,

709
00:49:11,730 --> 00:49:14,220
I not only trained in Nicole,

710
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:19,280
I trained to endure impact of temperature
and those are receptors of hours which

711
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:26,220
I've trained.
And then because of that,

712
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:29,370
which is part which is
controlled by the Hypothalamus,

713
00:49:29,371 --> 00:49:33,940
is the thermal regulator of our body.
And uh,

714
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:36,240
because I trained in the cold,

715
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:41,720
I trained the thermo regulation
of the body then without training,

716
00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:43,590
without training,

717
00:49:43,591 --> 00:49:48,591
a meter of running and then not drinking
a full marathon in the Namib desert,

718
00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:55,650
the eat without prior training
or ever been there before.

719
00:49:56,330 --> 00:50:01,080
Uh, I was very able to do that
because this thermal regulative,

720
00:50:01,690 --> 00:50:05,730
uh, mechanism, the
hypothalamus I had trained in,

721
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:10,020
uh, in, in the call, which
is the temperature impact.

722
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:13,710
So I learned to deal with the
temperature and you know, what,

723
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:18,540
and not only the temperature,
which is cold and heat,

724
00:50:18,990 --> 00:50:21,420
but also that prevention of oxygen.

725
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:26,250
That means going up mount
Everest and shorts at that means,

726
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:29,630
eh,
very cold out there.

727
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:34,930
There is no oxygen and you need
oxygen to and for combustion in the,

728
00:50:37,101 --> 00:50:42,101
in the cell to create heat
energy and there is no oxygen.

729
00:50:43,041 --> 00:50:48,041
So I learned in the cold how to deal with
impact on the barrel nervous system on

730
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:54,140
our metabolism.
That means cold deprivation of oxygen,

731
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:58,670
a heat,
but also stress daily stress.

732
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:03,410
So the secret of our comfort as you say,

733
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:08,600
and the people they are confusing,
uh, like the paraphrasing this,

734
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:12,340
this, this great guy, uh, of uh,

735
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:16,040
northern California who is telling
the truth. We are confused.

736
00:51:16,041 --> 00:51:19,760
We don't know animal what real confidence.

737
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:23,850
Real confidence is the power to regulate.
Uh,

738
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:27,800
all the impacts existence in,
in life.

739
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:29,780
That means disease,

740
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:34,160
which has impact on our body.
Heat,

741
00:51:34,370 --> 00:51:38,180
cold deprivation of oxygen,
stress in general,

742
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:43,400
any stress. And we are able to
control that a whole lot more.

743
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:48,580
And that brings about the real comfort
because if you connect yourself with all

744
00:51:49,311 --> 00:51:51,440
these older systems within,

745
00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:56,300
then you feel really good,
real good.

746
00:51:56,330 --> 00:52:00,970
It's real connection and that at that,
that's something be ago.

747
00:52:01,310 --> 00:52:06,310
That's why all these outdoor freaks and
the idiots and at teatro like myself are

748
00:52:07,521 --> 00:52:10,610
doing this because we just feel good.

749
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:12,301
Well,

750
00:52:12,301 --> 00:52:17,301
it seems like it's also a feeling
comfort is in a way becoming competent in

751
00:52:19,411 --> 00:52:20,850
discomfort, right? So you,

752
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:25,860
you have a confidence that you can handle
and adapt to whatever's going to come

753
00:52:25,861 --> 00:52:29,010
your way. A much like some
of the, I suppose, you know,

754
00:52:29,011 --> 00:52:33,690
elite military that I've met who are
or were very actually very relaxed.

755
00:52:33,691 --> 00:52:34,141
I mean the most,

756
00:52:34,141 --> 00:52:39,000
most of the high level guys I've met
because they've systematically exposed

757
00:52:39,001 --> 00:52:43,140
themselves to discomfort so they don't
fear discomfort, if that makes sense.

758
00:52:43,350 --> 00:52:43,770
All right.

759
00:52:43,770 --> 00:52:48,700
Secondly, they control their stress
hormone release completely, right?

760
00:52:48,701 --> 00:52:50,140
That's what I'm talking about.

761
00:52:50,730 --> 00:52:54,330
Now. You speak, how many
languages do you speak,

762
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:55,570
Ken?

763
00:52:55,570 --> 00:52:57,610
10 that is a lot of languages.

764
00:52:57,611 --> 00:53:01,060
How did you learn that many languages?

765
00:53:01,530 --> 00:53:05,970
Just be open and love
to learn and that's it.

766
00:53:06,570 --> 00:53:09,750
I had no real teachers then,
you know,

767
00:53:09,751 --> 00:53:13,230
people in the street and sometimes
had to look for a teacher,

768
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:15,990
like a Japanese teacher or,
uh,

769
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:21,600
they were in the Amsterdam and the
Hindu teacher pounded. And, uh, so,

770
00:53:21,630 --> 00:53:26,490
uh, yeah. Uh, I was just interested.
You are interested in life.

771
00:53:26,491 --> 00:53:30,450
You get to know and the never
stop learning because you love it.

772
00:53:30,890 --> 00:53:34,230
Is there is what language of
all the languages you've tried,

773
00:53:34,231 --> 00:53:38,280
what was the hardest for you Horace?
Maybe Polish,

774
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:43,640
Polish shoes because it's a complete
different set of a grammatical structures.

775
00:53:44,310 --> 00:53:48,650
I see.
Polish and Nostrovia I guess I have.

776
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,900
I bet you know that one. Yeah. Yeah.

777
00:53:57,170 --> 00:54:00,000
We definitely have to have a round two
with some, with some wine and beer.

778
00:54:00,001 --> 00:54:04,580
But the, um, the next question
I'd love to ask is, uh,

779
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:05,760
perhaps a simple one,

780
00:54:05,790 --> 00:54:10,790
but why are people fat and how can
people develop more brown fat and use it

781
00:54:13,110 --> 00:54:13,943
effectively?

782
00:54:14,310 --> 00:54:14,910
Yes.

783
00:54:14,910 --> 00:54:19,350
People are being fat because it's
a protective mechanism of the,

784
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:23,010
of our bodies.
It's actually in an answer to,

785
00:54:23,011 --> 00:54:27,510
to own too much impact,
too much wrong chemistry going on.

786
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:32,250
So it wants to make an
installation that's a,

787
00:54:32,251 --> 00:54:35,310
that's a natural thing to do of the body.

788
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:38,250
Now we are suffering from that.

789
00:54:38,251 --> 00:54:43,251
Now it's called obesity and being
overweight and we have no control.

790
00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:48,370
Just bringing them back to the
control. How do we do that? By, by,

791
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:51,540
by this adipose Bra,
Brown fat adipose,

792
00:54:52,170 --> 00:54:55,170
because they have a,
mostly of those people,

793
00:54:55,171 --> 00:54:59,510
I have also an absence of
brown fat because they are,

794
00:54:59,511 --> 00:55:02,880
have no stimulation
anymore for longer time.

795
00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:04,920
And then there's insulation.

796
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:08,280
A reflex is beginning
to build up a mailed up,

797
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:11,310
but actually the is telling,
Hey guy,

798
00:55:11,670 --> 00:55:16,320
I'm trying to do my best for you,
but you are not doing anything in return.

799
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:21,900
And as long as you're not triggering or
stimulating the adipose, the brown fat,

800
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:27,140
then it circums it goes away. And, and,

801
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:31,980
and that it is not able to, uh, to uh, uh,

802
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:37,240
uh, to divert a white fat
into energy anymore. Right?

803
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:40,050
So it's gone with people with obesity,

804
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:42,330
they have no brown fat animal.

805
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:46,530
So there is a logic explanation
to it and I know it,

806
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:50,350
so they have to bring it back.
And it's that whole

807
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:53,830
exposure primarily that would
be the first step to try to cold

808
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:57,780
cold exposure.
And that's real exposure to the elements.

809
00:55:58,050 --> 00:56:01,500
That's one in an adaptive way,
gradual way.

810
00:56:01,501 --> 00:56:04,440
I mean that we are able to adapt to it,

811
00:56:04,890 --> 00:56:09,180
but as these mechanisms are not working
really well within these people,

812
00:56:09,181 --> 00:56:13,560
so they have to be very uh,
sensitive and,

813
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:18,300
and uh, uh, gradual or going into it.

814
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:23,700
And the reading,
breathing is chemistry is yeah.

815
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:24,320
Is

816
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:29,080
influencing the chemistry right
here, right now. Better breathing,

817
00:56:29,081 --> 00:56:34,000
deeper breathing brings about
better ph degree in the body,

818
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:38,200
which then finally result
in a faster metabolism.

819
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:41,000
And if people are practicing
this or want to pack,

820
00:56:41,001 --> 00:56:42,770
practice this breathing on their own,

821
00:56:42,771 --> 00:56:47,360
is there any particular mantra or
anything they should focus on or say to

822
00:56:47,361 --> 00:56:51,080
themselves as they're doing this? Is any
type of meditation okay. To start with?

823
00:56:51,081 --> 00:56:54,290
Like using an app like headspace
or calm or do you have a particular

824
00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:57,230
recommendation? If someone
said, I have 10 minutes a day,

825
00:56:57,231 --> 00:57:01,370
I'm willing to spend doing this.
Um, what would you say to them?

826
00:57:01,830 --> 00:57:04,590
Yeah,
just have you a favorite music going on.

827
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:10,130
Go really into it and go really into the
breathing because it's about chemical

828
00:57:10,591 --> 00:57:15,591
changes and whenever you hear the right
music you are able to relax more and

829
00:57:16,741 --> 00:57:19,800
more. Auctions in Dan is
able to get into the body,

830
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:22,170
which is finally changing the,

831
00:57:22,670 --> 00:57:27,630
the Ph levels in the body, uh,
to the, to its natural state.

832
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:31,950
That's what we have
because we live in such a

833
00:57:33,510 --> 00:57:37,350
compressed society, uh, uh,
too much stress going on.

834
00:57:37,351 --> 00:57:42,351
We do not have control of the stress
we get out of our natural state.

835
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:47,340
So within 10 minutes we are,
I say within four minutes,

836
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:50,490
just do this breathing exercise,

837
00:57:51,090 --> 00:57:53,970
which I teach people and do pushups,

838
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:58,500
pushups without air in the lungs.
You should do that.

839
00:57:58,790 --> 00:58:00,920
So you do that after the,
after the exhale.

840
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:04,600
Yes. After, yeah, first year do like 30,

841
00:58:04,990 --> 00:58:09,310
like I explained deeply within,
go deeply with him,

842
00:58:09,770 --> 00:58:12,400
Eh, look at her indications, uh,

843
00:58:12,470 --> 00:58:17,110
feel feeling loose in the
body and lightheaded, uh,

844
00:58:17,111 --> 00:58:19,960
contractions a little bit
tingling, that's all. Okay.

845
00:58:19,961 --> 00:58:24,961
Like 30 or 40 deep breaths
and then letting go 40 times.

846
00:58:26,350 --> 00:58:31,350
Then you will arrive at that being charged
with a oxygen and carbon dioxide gas

847
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:36,550
got awake,
Ph levels gotten up.

848
00:58:36,910 --> 00:58:41,910
Then you shoot breathing fully
laughingo glow after exhalation,

849
00:58:42,131 --> 00:58:45,550
you stop and you go do
pushups and you will see,

850
00:58:45,551 --> 00:58:50,551
you are able to do more pushups without
air in the lungs because she influenced

851
00:58:50,921 --> 00:58:51,880
into the chemistry.

852
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:56,490
Hmm. That's end, uh, probably a good
idea to do on a soft surface first

853
00:58:59,170 --> 00:59:01,620
just in case he decided to kiss
the floor a little too hard.

854
00:59:02,550 --> 00:59:03,810
Now this is something that,
uh,

855
00:59:03,811 --> 00:59:06,300
that layered in his guys had
been working on as well. I mean,

856
00:59:06,301 --> 00:59:09,300
a lot of these guys are working in
doing pushups or stationary bike.

857
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:13,140
Very interesting. They have free divers
that, uh, there's sometimes work out with.

858
00:59:13,141 --> 00:59:16,920
It's very fascinating. Great.
Well I'm going to try that.

859
00:59:16,950 --> 00:59:21,950
I would love to switch gears just a
little bit and ask you a couple rapid

860
00:59:22,581 --> 00:59:24,770
questions.
You can certainly take your time.

861
00:59:24,771 --> 00:59:28,200
It doesn't mean you have to
answer them quickly, but, uh, the,

862
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:30,830
the first is when you think
of the word successful,

863
00:59:30,831 --> 00:59:33,260
who is the first person
who comes to mind for you?

864
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:38,233
The heart.

865
00:59:38,550 --> 00:59:43,010
That heart in any person that,
that, that that's success.

866
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,100
I'm further maybe Mandela.

867
00:59:48,470 --> 00:59:51,350
Nelson Mandela. Yes.
And, and with the heart,

868
00:59:51,351 --> 00:59:54,830
if someone feels like if
someone doesn't feel successful,

869
00:59:55,880 --> 01:00:00,200
uh, what would you, what would your
advice be to them? Or what would you,

870
01:00:00,201 --> 01:00:01,040
what would you say to them?

871
01:00:01,690 --> 01:00:05,290
Yeah, just do the method. I
mean, there's Methodist, Sherwin,

872
01:00:05,291 --> 01:00:10,291
scientifically to be able to tap into
the deepest of our physiology if somebody

873
01:00:11,081 --> 01:00:16,081
feels he's frustrated is because he is
not able to tap in his or hers physiology

874
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:22,630
at the deepest. He has no control.
That makes people frustrated.

875
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:24,940
And we, uh, we,

876
01:00:24,970 --> 01:00:28,090
we mirror that with society and all that.

877
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:33,190
But you got your vehicle.
If you are able to steer your vehicle,

878
01:00:33,191 --> 01:00:37,180
your body, your mind to
work, whatever you feel,

879
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:41,020
then you will be successful. So any, yes,

880
01:00:41,130 --> 01:00:45,380
I'm sorry to interrupt. I was just going
to ask him why Nelson Mandela. Yeah.

881
01:00:45,570 --> 01:00:48,630
Ah, yeah, he's just a good
guy. He was always smiling.

882
01:00:48,631 --> 01:00:50,670
He loved the women and uh,

883
01:00:51,270 --> 01:00:55,440
he stayed like 25 years
believing in this case.

884
01:00:55,910 --> 01:00:59,700
And that makes him, for
me really strong. And, uh,

885
01:00:59,820 --> 01:01:04,820
I love people who have faith simply
because that's what they feel.

886
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:09,840
And yes, I, uh, I've been,

887
01:01:09,841 --> 01:01:10,780
uh,
so,

888
01:01:10,830 --> 01:01:15,450
so many years the galactic and
mock to mock and all that, but uh,

889
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:20,480
always had my faith and now it is science
for the same like 20 years ago they

890
01:01:22,171 --> 01:01:27,120
told me, you're crazy. You're an idiot.
You're a lunatic and all that. Yes.

891
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:32,190
And even my, in my family, I was the
black sheep and right now I'm the,

892
01:01:32,191 --> 01:01:33,210
why does sheep,

893
01:01:36,530 --> 01:01:41,530
so it's a lot of hypocrisy going on in
the world because people do not know.

894
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:43,710
But I got my faith,

895
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:48,800
I got my belief and I want to go up till
the point that we scientifically showed

896
01:01:50,461 --> 01:01:55,380
everybody is able to tap in.
It's a endocrine system,

897
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:56,250
eh,

898
01:01:56,250 --> 01:02:01,250
so much that depression and being unhappy
and being frustrated is no longer part

899
01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:06,030
of humanity.
It's a choice.

900
01:02:06,970 --> 01:02:08,920
No, this was, uh, this
is a topic I, I'd be,

901
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:10,430
I think we could talk
about it for a long time.

902
01:02:10,450 --> 01:02:14,560
What is your favorite book or the book
that you've given to other people the

903
01:02:14,561 --> 01:02:15,640
most as a gift?

904
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:18,013
Whoa.

905
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:19,890
Never gave many books

906
01:02:20,860 --> 01:02:25,270
except for the books are right, right.
What do you give to people as gifts?

907
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:26,680
What do you like to give people as gifts?

908
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:30,990
Oh, as stones, stones, a lot
of sat and natural things.

909
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:33,030
I get people in the natural things.

910
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:38,480
I collected a whole bunch of things
and then two months later I'm,

911
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:43,170
I'm fed up with the thing and then I
take this one, wants to go with him.

912
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:46,060
And those are beautiful stones.

913
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:50,820
When I told them the first time
I got great stone. Beautiful. Oh,

914
01:02:51,090 --> 01:02:55,020
this a artifact. Well,
what your aid. Wow. Nice.

915
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:59,820
Then two months later it's gone,
you know? Then I just gave it away.

916
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:01,800
Add. So, Eh, with books,

917
01:03:01,801 --> 01:03:06,390
the same thing as see darker,
see data.

918
01:03:06,391 --> 01:03:11,391
And Jonathan Livingston Seagull
comes to my mind and that's okay.

919
01:03:12,541 --> 01:03:17,541
And some scriptures I read about the
Bhagavad Gita and the Bible of course,

920
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:21,240
Ebay,
all these books.

921
01:03:22,260 --> 01:03:25,250
I was reading hundreds of books and uh,

922
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:30,300
at a certain point I could not make
the connection with my deepest within

923
01:03:31,531 --> 01:03:36,000
myself, which was the
seeker. I was sold searching.

924
01:03:36,060 --> 01:03:41,060
And I found it finally in the open book
of the ice water because the ice water

925
01:03:42,481 --> 01:03:44,910
is merciless but righteous.

926
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:49,560
It brings you just within and uh,
there is no,

927
01:03:49,630 --> 01:03:50,463
uh,

928
01:03:50,850 --> 01:03:55,050
there is no chit chatting around
that there's no philosophy.

929
01:03:55,290 --> 01:03:58,080
You just do it right or you do it wrong.

930
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:05,090
Now you've had of course, some,
some very challenging times.

931
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:09,290
Um, perhaps more so than
many people I've spoken with.

932
01:04:09,350 --> 01:04:13,580
You had very tragic premature
death it with your wife.

933
01:04:13,610 --> 01:04:17,660
In the case of your wife,
what do you do to,

934
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:23,560
to overcome those dark
periods? Yes, very uh,

935
01:04:23,590 --> 01:04:28,360
very good, very interesting.
Very real and deep. God, uh,

936
01:04:28,390 --> 01:04:33,310
losing, uh, the person you love.
I have four children with her.

937
01:04:33,850 --> 01:04:35,290
They work with me and uh,

938
01:04:35,291 --> 01:04:38,860
right now they are like 33 years old,

939
01:04:38,861 --> 01:04:43,540
the oldest one and then two
daughters and another son.

940
01:04:43,930 --> 01:04:46,000
And they all work with me right now.
Oh,

941
01:04:46,001 --> 01:04:51,001
actually one is working right now at
the Dutch embassy in Washington DC in

942
01:04:51,551 --> 01:04:55,630
America. But the rest is
working with me all the time.

943
01:04:55,690 --> 01:04:59,170
So losing the love of your life,

944
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:04,300
how deep can you go?
And being ted apart,

945
01:05:05,230 --> 01:05:10,090
that was what I was experienced
at the time. But then,

946
01:05:10,710 --> 01:05:15,410
Eh, I was the only person
who was, uh, re, uh, Ooh,

947
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:20,870
I was alone and I had to raise four
kids alone and that they were like seven

948
01:05:22,271 --> 01:05:26,260
years old, eight years,
nine years and 11 years.

949
01:05:26,860 --> 01:05:31,520
And I had to raise them alone.
So I received so much love, Eh,

950
01:05:31,610 --> 01:05:35,860
of, of my kids. And I did my training.

951
01:05:36,220 --> 01:05:38,590
And as I told you, Eh, the,

952
01:05:38,591 --> 01:05:43,420
the brainstem is alter the
area of the seat of emotion,

953
01:05:43,810 --> 01:05:45,520
which is the Amygdala.

954
01:05:46,210 --> 01:05:49,300
And because of this training in the cold,

955
01:05:49,510 --> 01:05:54,510
I could control silence myself and go on
and always find the energy to go on and

956
01:05:56,921 --> 01:06:01,921
to be a father happy and
exercising and practical and uh,

957
01:06:03,340 --> 01:06:07,580
with my kids. And uh, they
gave me a lot of love.

958
01:06:08,020 --> 01:06:08,853
But

959
01:06:10,270 --> 01:06:15,270
the thing about grief and the emotion is
you have to go deep because emotion is

960
01:06:17,411 --> 01:06:22,210
going deep. And as we live in the
comfort zone, we have no control,

961
01:06:22,211 --> 01:06:26,560
mostly over emotion.
And I tell you there is a way to,

962
01:06:26,950 --> 01:06:29,620
uh,
control the seat of emotion,

963
01:06:29,621 --> 01:06:34,150
which is the Amygdala connected to
the, uh, in the area of the brain stem.

964
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:37,000
So I think this, uh, uh,

965
01:06:37,060 --> 01:06:40,930
not think my experience
tells me discipline,

966
01:06:41,050 --> 01:06:42,730
discipline and believing,

967
01:06:42,731 --> 01:06:47,530
believing within there
is a weight to silence,

968
01:06:47,710 --> 01:06:51,190
a grieved,
broken hearts,

969
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:56,410
grieve and Burt emotions.
Yes,

970
01:06:56,770 --> 01:06:58,530
it's a,
it's a way did it

971
01:06:58,910 --> 01:07:03,750
and the, um, it's, it's really been
fascinating for me to observe a,

972
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:06,590
a number of people,
I won't mention some of the other names,

973
01:07:06,591 --> 01:07:10,070
but who have used specifically,
uh,

974
01:07:10,071 --> 01:07:12,230
exposure to the cold too.

975
01:07:12,620 --> 01:07:17,210
I suppose the purity of that cold and
the attention that requires a sort of

976
01:07:17,211 --> 01:07:21,590
purity of attention that it requires to
overcome very dark periods or be to act

977
01:07:21,591 --> 01:07:26,470
as a very strong component for passing
through those difficult periods. It's,

978
01:07:26,471 --> 01:07:27,081
it's just a,

979
01:07:27,081 --> 01:07:30,820
it's a very fascinating pattern that
I've observed in a number of my,

980
01:07:31,010 --> 01:07:34,610
a number of my friends.
Uh, I recognize what is,

981
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:39,590
what is your morning, the first
60 minutes of your day look like?

982
01:07:39,591 --> 01:07:40,460
When do you wake up?

983
01:07:40,461 --> 01:07:44,240
What do you do in those first 60 minutes
if you have complete control over that

984
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:44,840
morning

985
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:47,590
was time to get into conscious breathing,

986
01:07:47,591 --> 01:07:50,230
where consciously
breathe when you wake up.

987
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:55,000
And your setup is all about vital for us,
created by oxygen.

988
01:07:56,190 --> 01:08:00,880
It's for free and it's there
and I said it's to me it's so,

989
01:08:01,270 --> 01:08:05,880
it's God itself, they'll like
for Noma, the vital force,

990
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:08,193
the Prana,

991
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:13,350
it's all a different names of
God and they tell all the uh,

992
01:08:13,930 --> 01:08:15,530
the,
the uh,

993
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:20,920
belief systems still that that's the
vital for us of any off of life itself.

994
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:27,320
So that's the, that's a
very logic, natural way.

995
01:08:27,321 --> 01:08:29,360
I begin brief

996
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:31,740
still still laying in bed.

997
01:08:32,110 --> 01:08:36,220
Yeah, still laying in
bed and then uh, to uh,

998
01:08:36,340 --> 01:08:38,410
doing the exercise,
uh,

999
01:08:38,650 --> 01:08:43,180
which I explained prior in this interview.
Uh,

1000
01:08:43,181 --> 01:08:44,320
it is,
yeah,

1001
01:08:44,340 --> 01:08:49,340
it is very nice because you are still
very relaxed and about the body is without

1002
01:08:51,341 --> 01:08:52,174
tension.

1003
01:08:52,450 --> 01:08:57,450
So you then are able to go
tap deeply into the system.

1004
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:00,820
And how long will you do
that in bed typically?

1005
01:09:01,420 --> 01:09:04,150
Yeah,
it's a stay a half hour,

1006
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:09,160
something like that before going into
action could be an hour because it's

1007
01:09:09,791 --> 01:09:11,530
never,
never boring.

1008
01:09:14,090 --> 01:09:15,810
What would you say to someone who says,
you know,

1009
01:09:15,811 --> 01:09:18,860
actually I find it really boring. I'm
not saying that I feel that way, but if,

1010
01:09:19,710 --> 01:09:21,210
if someone felt boring,
what would you,

1011
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:23,130
what would you advise them
or what would you tell them?

1012
01:09:23,350 --> 01:09:28,330
It's [inaudible] once again, the same
thing as this California and a great guy,

1013
01:09:28,331 --> 01:09:30,820
Dean, Dean. Dean Cortez. Yeah.

1014
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:35,020
The income assets and they don't
know what come for this all about.

1015
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:37,100
So,
uh,

1016
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:42,140
going d just by breathing into
the depth of our physiology,

1017
01:09:43,060 --> 01:09:44,250
it's like Galen,

1018
01:09:44,260 --> 01:09:49,260
the aim of all those people going
into outdoor or taking drugs or eh,

1019
01:09:52,180 --> 01:09:55,180
doing extremes or a goal for a rush.

1020
01:09:55,570 --> 01:09:58,090
Now you can our age old to learn,

1021
01:09:58,091 --> 01:10:03,091
to control the depth of your physiology
by just breathing properly and going

1022
01:10:04,621 --> 01:10:05,620
into that system.

1023
01:10:05,650 --> 01:10:10,650
And a boring is something if you are doing
things repetitiously but not breaking

1024
01:10:14,351 --> 01:10:16,120
through the conditioning.

1025
01:10:16,350 --> 01:10:19,510
And I learned to go
through the conditioning,

1026
01:10:19,660 --> 01:10:22,620
right? So if you have to be
conscious about the activity,

1027
01:10:22,621 --> 01:10:26,090
you can't be daydreaming.
It's,

1028
01:10:26,190 --> 01:10:28,650
it seems you just have to be attentive
to your breathing when you're doing

1029
01:10:28,651 --> 01:10:29,460
something like this.

1030
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:34,160
Yes, yes. Just go into it.
It's like the past meditation.

1031
01:10:34,610 --> 01:10:35,690
That's what they do.

1032
01:10:36,110 --> 01:10:41,110
They sit and they just
listen and focus on grieving.

1033
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:43,910
That's all at what I do.

1034
01:10:43,940 --> 01:10:48,940
And they get into a deeper layer of
their brain because they are not giving

1035
01:10:50,961 --> 01:10:55,400
their focus to something else
than just mayor breathing.

1036
01:10:55,700 --> 01:10:57,860
It is so simple,
but so effective.

1037
01:10:58,580 --> 01:11:02,990
I'll try that tomorrow morning. The, so
let's say you do that for a half hour,

1038
01:11:03,620 --> 01:11:05,420
then what do you do
for the next half hour?

1039
01:11:06,660 --> 01:11:07,493
Um,

1040
01:11:07,860 --> 01:11:12,860
nowadays I do a lot to do with a lot
of workshops and lectures and then,

1041
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:19,320
uh, into science. But yeah, uh,

1042
01:11:19,510 --> 01:11:23,730
for in between I do exercising.
I like exercising.

1043
01:11:23,830 --> 01:11:25,390
What type of exercise do you,

1044
01:11:25,420 --> 01:11:28,960
if you had to choose one type of exercise
are two types of exercise for yourself,

1045
01:11:28,961 --> 01:11:31,780
what would you choose?
A strength and flexibility.

1046
01:11:32,050 --> 01:11:33,670
What would you do for both of those

1047
01:11:34,250 --> 01:11:38,140
as strength? Power
example, stay on two arms.

1048
01:11:38,141 --> 01:11:43,130
Save four minutes like a planet or just
different types of poses onto our mat

1049
01:11:43,420 --> 01:11:48,420
with one hand or to a
plank or a handstands or,

1050
01:11:49,750 --> 01:11:54,440
uh, pullups pushups of course,
eh, those, uh, you know,

1051
01:11:54,460 --> 01:11:58,810
power exercises or stand in
a horse stance for an hour.

1052
01:11:59,550 --> 01:12:04,550
That is sometimes just to with stones in
my hands and I make all kinds of food,

1053
01:12:07,110 --> 01:12:10,810
like, uh, movements,
just make them up and,

1054
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:15,490
but you know,
to battle my aesthetic,

1055
01:12:16,180 --> 01:12:18,550
the aesthetic processes in my body.

1056
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:23,760
So I go deeply into the horse stance
and breathe in a way that a acid is not

1057
01:12:25,940 --> 01:12:30,790
[inaudible] in the body. So that makes
me control the body and uh, yeah,

1058
01:12:30,860 --> 01:12:34,330
it feels good. And then
for flexibility, yeah,

1059
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:38,830
all kinds of splits and then put a
couple of lags and Maya behind my head,

1060
01:12:38,831 --> 01:12:43,390
the things, you know, uh,
do balancing a exercises.

1061
01:12:43,391 --> 01:12:48,220
It's nice. Uh, Eh, I, I
maintained the body that way.

1062
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:53,340
What do you listen to music when you're
exercising or do you do without music?

1063
01:12:54,710 --> 01:12:58,960
I simply have no record
system. So, but eh, Eh,

1064
01:12:59,380 --> 01:13:02,770
right now I'm a w we bought a center.

1065
01:13:03,460 --> 01:13:07,760
So I will have my big doe,
Joe and a Whoa.

1066
01:13:07,770 --> 01:13:12,100
A cascade and all that,
and a swimming pool and all those things.

1067
01:13:12,101 --> 01:13:16,300
And that I will have the right
music and make music myself. I,

1068
01:13:16,660 --> 01:13:18,730
uh,
I played the guitar,

1069
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:21,700
I saying I want to make a CD very soon.

1070
01:13:21,770 --> 01:13:25,060
And people like me singing,
uh,

1071
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:27,640
doing all kinds of mantras because I,
you know,

1072
01:13:27,641 --> 01:13:32,641
learned about the sunscreen
and a Spanish songs,

1073
01:13:32,681 --> 01:13:35,890
a English songs and all kinds of songs.

1074
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:38,760
I just make up my sort of a wrapper

1075
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:43,190
too. So. Yeah, I'd love
to hear it. And what, uh,

1076
01:13:43,220 --> 01:13:47,130
what musician do you look up to the most?

1077
01:13:47,131 --> 01:13:52,131
Is there a particular musician that you
admire that you would like to emulate or

1078
01:13:52,530 --> 01:13:53,030
look up?

1079
01:13:53,030 --> 01:13:57,050
I like a lot, a lot, a lot
of lounge, EH, easy music.

1080
01:13:57,110 --> 01:14:01,500
I like Michael Jackson. Michael
Jackson's great. Yeah, he is a fit.

1081
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:06,320
Do you have a favorite song or a favorite
album? Uh, of, of uh, Michael Jackson?

1082
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:10,850
Yes. Yeah, all the songs. This is it,

1083
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:14,540
for example, it's a great oh
yeah, great deal is great.

1084
01:14:15,130 --> 01:14:19,440
And his voice is mass Merrick.
Oh yeah, totally. Yeah.

1085
01:14:19,690 --> 01:14:22,590
Yeah.
So I uh,

1086
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:26,800
get my son his name,
which is Michael,

1087
01:14:27,130 --> 01:14:30,490
which is one of my songs.
So things like that,

1088
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:35,460
but also pink Floyd, also Gypsy
kings, you know, plumbing,

1089
01:14:36,140 --> 01:14:41,140
Flamenco and all the goop music and
there's a lot of good music going on

1090
01:14:41,750 --> 01:14:45,710
and uh, yes, I can't wait to
visit the, uh, the center.

1091
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:46,940
Is that going to be in Holland?

1092
01:14:47,430 --> 01:14:49,770
Yes. Okay. For now, I
would say in Holland,

1093
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:54,800
I was looking to make a center in
the near San Francisco as well.

1094
01:14:55,470 --> 01:14:57,540
I get some very good friends over there.

1095
01:14:57,690 --> 01:14:59,400
You should, you should,
you should come up.

1096
01:14:59,430 --> 01:15:02,700
Maybe we'll do a workshop
and I could introduce you
to, I'll invite Dean as well.

1097
01:15:02,701 --> 01:15:06,750
You could meet dean. Yes. Yes.
He's a great guy. He's a great guy.

1098
01:15:07,590 --> 01:15:12,420
He would love to meet you. I'm sure.
The, just a few more questions.

1099
01:15:12,421 --> 01:15:15,550
I want to be obviously respectful
of your time. What, uh,

1100
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:19,980
what purchase in the last, you know,
six months or a year of less than $100.

1101
01:15:20,010 --> 01:15:24,330
So something you bought for less than
$100 has most positively impacted your

1102
01:15:24,331 --> 01:15:28,740
life. Stones, stones. I love these stones.

1103
01:15:28,741 --> 01:15:29,574
I want to talk about.

1104
01:15:30,290 --> 01:15:33,880
So how do you find these stones
and what makes you pick one? Uh,

1105
01:15:33,881 --> 01:15:34,890
do you have any favorites?

1106
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:37,630
I always take a stones out.

1107
01:15:37,890 --> 01:15:41,180
Whatever touches matter meets the eye.
Uh,

1108
01:15:41,220 --> 01:15:43,700
I take them from the
mountains had climbed,

1109
01:15:44,420 --> 01:15:49,420
but I also like these tests and
a old pills and all kinds of,

1110
01:15:51,410 --> 01:15:56,210
you know, beautiful stones where the
beautiful colors. I like that. But uh,

1111
01:15:56,660 --> 01:15:59,620
yeah, I always take
stones from the uh, uh,

1112
01:15:59,660 --> 01:16:03,980
I just found a big for sale in the,

1113
01:16:03,981 --> 01:16:06,570
in the Spanish period.
Knees, you know, big,

1114
01:16:06,730 --> 01:16:10,490
big means like two to three kilos.

1115
01:16:11,570 --> 01:16:15,600
That's a big, big bottle
there and forced out. And uh,

1116
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:20,720
and uh, I couldn't get it down because
a, it was there where the group,

1117
01:16:20,750 --> 01:16:23,990
the ad, the ad, no, a backpack.

1118
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:29,040
And I had to carry the ropes because
we were doing canyon and all that.

1119
01:16:30,020 --> 01:16:34,250
So, but, uh, there was a girl
from Austin, Texas, Austin,

1120
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:37,750
Elizabeth Lee, and she
had a backpack. And See,

1121
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:42,830
she carried it there for me. It's a good
friend. Yeah. Always. Yeah. I love it.

1122
01:16:43,150 --> 01:16:47,880
Yeah. Yeah. So the what,
what effect do, and did you,

1123
01:16:47,881 --> 01:16:50,620
do you put that in your kitchen?
Where do you put such a,

1124
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:53,220
such a stone and what
effect does it have on you?

1125
01:16:54,130 --> 01:16:58,200
Everywhere they, they have a
solid I've hacked is hey, yeah,

1126
01:16:58,210 --> 01:17:03,210
simply there and they are beautiful and
I always pass them on to other people

1127
01:17:04,690 --> 01:17:05,740
except for the big ones.

1128
01:17:09,460 --> 01:17:13,790
What, uh, what advice would
you give your 30 year old self?

1129
01:17:14,870 --> 01:17:19,100
My 30th and just have faith.
Have faith.

1130
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:20,730
Faith.
Yes.

1131
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:25,170
What type of faith that things will
work out? The things will be okay.

1132
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:28,110
[inaudible] simple logic,

1133
01:17:28,111 --> 01:17:32,400
half simple logic and understanding I
things simply and, and listen to you.

1134
01:17:32,401 --> 01:17:35,550
You're feeling listened to.
You're feeling,

1135
01:17:35,551 --> 01:17:38,150
you're feeling it knows it.

1136
01:17:38,250 --> 01:17:43,250
It is simply sense making and that if you
are letting it in your way of thinking

1137
01:17:49,130 --> 01:17:53,910
and never lose track of whatever
makes sense, which is feeling,

1138
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:56,310
which is instinct and intuition.

1139
01:17:56,510 --> 01:17:57,680
Right,
right.

1140
01:17:57,740 --> 01:18:01,550
This is something I've been trying to
work on a lot because it's easy for me at

1141
01:18:01,551 --> 01:18:06,551
least to get trapped in my neocortex to
get trapped exactly in the front of my

1142
01:18:06,981 --> 01:18:09,050
brain where I can make pro and con lists.

1143
01:18:09,051 --> 01:18:13,190
But the answer is so obvious sometimes
because you know that something's wrong

1144
01:18:13,191 --> 01:18:17,780
or you know that someone isn't a good
fit or you don't trust someone just like,

1145
01:18:17,810 --> 01:18:19,460
yeah,
you have that feeling like a dog.

1146
01:18:19,461 --> 01:18:23,040
Where are you immediately either
like or dislike something? Yes. It's,

1147
01:18:23,060 --> 01:18:26,720
I've been trying to train myself to
go back to that simplicity. It's,

1148
01:18:26,721 --> 01:18:29,460
I'm making sense. It can
be challenging. Yeah.

1149
01:18:30,470 --> 01:18:35,420
So what one or two more questions, the,
if, if you could have one billboard,

1150
01:18:35,450 --> 01:18:38,890
one huge sign anywhere
with anything on it, uh,

1151
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:41,330
what would it say and
where would you put it?

1152
01:18:42,490 --> 01:18:44,980
I would say a brief motherfucker.

1153
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:49,353
Okay.

1154
01:18:49,940 --> 01:18:51,620
You could put that on like a busy highway.

1155
01:18:51,621 --> 01:18:54,050
You can put that on like sunset
boulevard in Los Angeles. Or

1156
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:59,530
I got maybe a brief, a, Eh, you know,

1157
01:19:00,490 --> 01:19:04,750
I don't know why their way day. I noticed
that it, but it's really meant lovable.

1158
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:05,673
Right.

1159
01:19:05,980 --> 01:19:10,980
And you know which strength is the
answer to the APP till the DNA itself.

1160
01:19:13,060 --> 01:19:16,870
And it's not me telling that anymore
because of the blood results.

1161
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:21,310
Professors have confirmed that
we are in the middle of DNA.

1162
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:24,190
And what is the trigger breathing?

1163
01:19:25,050 --> 01:19:28,410
So this is a, so you could,
you could have it say breathe,

1164
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:32,430
breathe motherfucker within a smiley,
a smiley face, like a smiley emoticon.

1165
01:19:32,431 --> 01:19:33,264
That'd be perfect.

1166
01:19:34,450 --> 01:19:37,660
Yes. It's, so we got a t shirt at,

1167
01:19:37,661 --> 01:19:41,250
says I'm the front please.
You know,

1168
01:19:41,310 --> 01:19:45,270
it's about the cold enough and that the
other side is Britain. Motherfucker.

1169
01:19:48,110 --> 01:19:52,560
Oh well you and I need to hang out more.
I uh, this is, this has been great. Uh,

1170
01:19:52,570 --> 01:19:54,170

1175
01:20:09,451 --> 01:20:14,250
which a bunch of people whose names
you would know are using right now.

1176
01:20:14,251 --> 01:20:14,701
It's very,

1177
01:20:14,701 --> 01:20:18,510
very interesting and there are bunch of
documentaries and links to the textbooks

when do you have any last requests
or asks of my audience there?

1180
01:20:27,851 --> 01:20:29,790
There are a lot of people
who will be hearing this.

1181
01:20:29,970 --> 01:20:33,010
If you could ask them all to do something.
Um,

1182
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:36,540
besides checkout the courses and so on.
What, what would you ask them to do?

1183
01:20:36,750 --> 01:20:39,240
Something they could do when they
hear this or after they hear it?

1184
01:20:40,050 --> 01:20:43,710
Yeah, just pass it on grief. That's one.

1185
01:20:43,890 --> 01:20:48,890
And take a cold shower after a hot word
and it just get into the science of

1186
01:20:50,761 --> 01:20:53,370
this. Oh, it is non speculative.

01:22:06,910 --> 01:22:10,300
hey guys, this is Tim again. Just a
few more things before you take off.

1207
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:13,300
Number one,
this is five bullet Friday.

1208
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:16,150
Do you want to get a short email from me?

1209
01:22:16,180 --> 01:22:18,760
Would you enjoy getting a short
email from me every Friday?

1210
01:22:19,030 --> 01:22:22,540
That provides a little more
soul of fun before the weekend.

1211
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:26,920
And five bullet Friday is a very short
email where I share the coolest things

1212
01:22:26,921 --> 01:22:29,500
I've found or that I've been
pondering over the week.

1213
01:22:29,710 --> 01:22:32,500
That could include favorite new
albums that I've discovered.

1214
01:22:32,501 --> 01:22:35,950
It could include Gizmos and gadgets
and all sorts of weird shit that I've

1215
01:22:35,951 --> 01:22:40,270
somehow dug up in the, uh, the
world of the esoteric as I do.

1216
01:22:40,540 --> 01:22:45,540
It could include favorite articles that
I've read and that I've shared with my

1217
01:22:46,211 --> 01:22:48,940
close friends for instance.
And it's very short.

1218
01:22:49,030 --> 01:22:54,010
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness
before you head off for the weekend.

1219
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:56,200
So if you want to receive that,

you by a new sponsor. So listen up folks.

1224
01:23:10,181 --> 01:23:14,140
This is a good one because have you ever
wanted to be as powerful as a bullet

1225
01:23:14,141 --> 01:23:19,141
wearing Ninja from 1980s movie or as
flamboyant as big gay Al Big Al in south

1226
01:23:20,591 --> 01:23:24,690
park or a sleek as a black panther
and the Amazon on the hunt wealth?

1227
01:23:24,691 --> 01:23:28,750
There's great news because I've been
testing this product that you wrap around

1228
01:23:28,751 --> 01:23:32,140
your genitals and it makes you feel
like a superhero and it is called

1229
01:23:32,210 --> 01:23:32,980
[inaudible].

1230
01:23:32,980 --> 01:23:36,550
I've spent the last two to three weeks
traveling with underwear from these guys

1231
01:23:36,580 --> 01:23:38,860
and they are comfy.
I got to tell you,

1232
01:23:39,130 --> 01:23:43,510
it feels like a Geisha has giving your
groin a hug and it's not just for dudes,

1233
01:23:43,511 --> 01:23:47,460
but if you go to [inaudible] dot com
forward slash Tim, that's Emma, e,

1234
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:50,200
u n d I e s.com forward slash.
Tim,

1235
01:23:50,201 --> 01:23:53,020
you can see all of the underwear
that I've been wearing.

1236
01:23:53,260 --> 01:23:57,970
There's some pretty ridiculous ones
and I will also highlight my favorite.

1237
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,530
You'll probably be able
to guess which it is.

1238
01:24:00,130 --> 01:24:02,170
These underwear made from micro model,

1239
01:24:02,171 --> 01:24:05,860
which is extruded from Austrian
beechwood trees and the Alps. Yes,

1240
01:24:05,890 --> 01:24:08,290
fancy and it's two times
softer than cotton.

1241
01:24:08,500 --> 01:24:12,960
Scientifically tested using the Calamata
method developed in Kyoto. You know,

1242
01:24:12,961 --> 01:24:17,380
those Japanese very crafty and uh,
I will say a few things. Number one,

1243
01:24:17,381 --> 01:24:21,090
if you go to [inaudible] dot com forward
slash Tim you get to see all of these

1244
01:24:21,091 --> 01:24:24,250
spectacular underwear that I'd been
wearing and I am a bit of an underwear

1245
01:24:24,251 --> 01:24:28,930
connoisseur, socks, fashion sense with
sweat pants, not so much underwear.

1246
01:24:29,020 --> 01:24:33,040
I understand. So check them out and if
you go to mandy.com forward slash Tim,

1248
01:24:37,750 --> 01:24:38,770
female underwear.

1249
01:24:38,890 --> 01:24:42,640
And that's just a lot of goodness for
both the men and the women out there.

1250
01:24:42,641 --> 01:24:45,640
So check it out.
[inaudible] dot com forward slash Tim,

1251
01:24:45,670 --> 01:24:47,680
I love these underwear and a,

1252
01:24:47,681 --> 01:24:52,090
I'm going to be packing tonight probably
six to 12 pair to take with me to

Australia. They're great. Check them
out. [inaudible] dot com forward slash.

Tim this episode is brought to you by
audible, which I've used for years.

1255
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:04,420
I love audiobooks and I've two
to recommend right off the bat.

1256
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:07,660
Number one is pressed my
favorite audio book of all time.

1257
01:25:07,661 --> 01:25:10,390
And that is the graveyard
book by Neil Gaiman.

1258
01:25:10,420 --> 01:25:14,620
The only audiobook I've wanted to
immediately listen to a second time.

1259
01:25:14,621 --> 01:25:18,970
As soon as I finished. It's amazing.
You will thank me. The graveyard book.

1260
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,700
The second is faggot
bonding by Rolf Potts,

1261
01:25:21,701 --> 01:25:26,290
which had a huge impact on my life and
formed the basis for a lot of what became

1262
01:25:26,380 --> 01:25:27,340
the four hour work week.

1263
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:32,400
