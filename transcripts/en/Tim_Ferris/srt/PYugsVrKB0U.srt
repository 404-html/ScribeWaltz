1
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,820
Cindy, welcome to the show. Thanks for
having me. I am very excited to dig in.

2
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:23,770
And a, I thought we could start. Can I
in media arrests as they say in novels,

3
00:00:23,771 --> 00:00:25,060
we start right in the
middle of the action.

4
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:27,700
So we're going to bounce all
over the place. As I always do.

5
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:31,210
Jp Morgan Healthcare Conference,

6
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:36,720
I've heard some sort of murmurs about
stories and getting attention or people to

7
00:00:37,631 --> 00:00:40,930
focus. Could you please describe
for folks what happened?

8
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:44,750
Awesome. So biggest conference in
all of healthcare I get invited in.

9
00:00:44,751 --> 00:00:46,790
I have eight minutes do or die.

10
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:50,930
So proud of this opportunity again in
front of the room. You can imagine.

11
00:00:50,931 --> 00:00:53,480
Here's me in hot pink,
head to toe.

12
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:57,620
I started to talk about women in sex
and the whole room starts to giggle.

13
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:00,320
I can feel this giggle
going off or you know,

14
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:05,350
across the crowd and I'm panicking like
watching the clock count down so I can

15
00:01:05,931 --> 00:01:07,220
remember reaching to my laptop.

16
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:11,030
That's where in as fast as I can to a
slide that was just brain scan studies.

17
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:15,140
Studies of women with this condition
versus women without were in black and

18
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:18,740
white. We could see there's a biological
basis to women's lack of desire for sex.

19
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,140
So I turned,
I put the slide up,

20
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:25,370
I turned and pointed long enough for
it to be uncomfortable for everybody.

21
00:01:25,371 --> 00:01:29,540
I went silent. And when I
did that, I said, are you
looking at what I'm looking at?

22
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,350
Cause I'm here.

23
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:34,160
I'm just here to talk about the biology
of sex for women is an important lesson

24
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:37,100
for me. If at what I was going to
have to do to make people focus.

25
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,340
You let the silence do the work.
It was uncomfortable.

26
00:01:40,341 --> 00:01:43,340
I figured it was long enough for
it to be uncomfortable for me,

27
00:01:43,341 --> 00:01:44,870
which was a fair trade for them.

28
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:47,870
Have you made me really uncomfortable if
they started giggling and wouldn't pay

29
00:01:47,871 --> 00:01:48,704
attention?

30
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:54,140
Silence. Yeah. It's uh,
it's so powerful. It's so,

31
00:01:54,141 --> 00:01:54,974
so powerful.

32
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:58,140
And I remember advice I was given at
one point while I was given that advice

33
00:01:58,141 --> 00:02:02,670
first by someone named cal Fussman is
a master interviewer when he was going

34
00:02:02,671 --> 00:02:05,580
over some transcripts from this podcast
in the early days. And he's like, no,

35
00:02:05,581 --> 00:02:08,970
you're too fast. Like you
don't leave gaps. Hmm. Uh,

36
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,480
and you don't have to save people, like
let the silence do the work. So I just, I,

37
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,820
I love that story. And so speaking
of letting the silence do the work,

38
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:20,160
I'm going to go silent for a
bit because I want to ask you

39
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:25,650
two questions that I'm might take a few
minutes to answer them and start with a

40
00:02:25,651 --> 00:02:29,950
short one. What is your
favorite business and why? Hmm.

41
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,190
My favorite business of all is Wegmans,

42
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:36,450
which if anybody's from the northeast,
uh,

43
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,230
they appreciate this as a grocery store.

44
00:02:38,231 --> 00:02:40,450
How can you get excited
about a grocery store?

45
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,470
I'm excited because
it's from my birthplace.

46
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:45,820
Rochester and I went there
every Sunday as a little girl.

47
00:02:45,821 --> 00:02:50,821
Here's why I loved it because of the
incredible loyalty that they instilled.

48
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:55,960
How do you get folks that are cashiers
at the checkout line with jobs that may

49
00:02:55,961 --> 00:03:00,961
seem relatively unexciting to show up
with unbridled enthusiasm for what they

50
00:03:01,901 --> 00:03:05,440
do? So it opened years later
I moved my whole life, uh,

51
00:03:05,441 --> 00:03:10,441
and it opened in the DC area and I went
the first day that Wegmans opened in DC

52
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:15,070
and I walked up and all of their employees
are standing outside holding their

53
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:19,330
hands above their head like a w
because they have a Wegmans pride,

54
00:03:19,331 --> 00:03:21,850
the Wegmans way.
And I got to tell you that first date,

55
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:26,880
anybody in the entire DC metro area who'd
ever been to a Wegmans showed up and

56
00:03:27,431 --> 00:03:29,170
stood in line to walk through this store.

57
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:34,350
I love them for being a private family
held business that has that kind of

58
00:03:34,691 --> 00:03:36,670
loyalty and longevity of employees.

59
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,080
How do they instill that?

60
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:42,280
I mean is it's filtering for the right
employees who are prone to that to begin

61
00:03:42,281 --> 00:03:45,280
with? Is it something else?
I mean how do they develop?

62
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,370
I think it is,
oh so simple.

63
00:03:47,371 --> 00:03:51,210
I think it is their basic appreciation
for the people who show up and work for

64
00:03:51,211 --> 00:03:54,720
them every day and they reward
them through the right incentives.

65
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,680
They reward them through the best
benefits. They help develop them,

66
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,930
they encourage them when they lose weight.

67
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:05,850
I mean there are all of these incentives
to their employees that make them truly

68
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:09,840
feel that appreciation from their
employer. And also I think, you know,

69
00:04:09,841 --> 00:04:14,130
be proud to work there. They go home and
have pride in saying who they work for.

70
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,760
So I started studying businesses
I loved at a very young age.

71
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:23,600
I had a conversation with Frank Blake,
former CEO of home depot right here.

72
00:04:23,601 --> 00:04:28,601
He's sitting where you are and who they
develop this orange apron cult as it was

73
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:32,520
sometimes referred to and the dedication
that some of these employee shows.

74
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:33,403
Incredible.

75
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:37,730
And his point was in one of these
systems they instilled was a positive

76
00:04:37,731 --> 00:04:42,731
reinforcement by sharing stories on a
very regular schedule basis of kind of

77
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:45,800
stand out customer service.

78
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,130
And it doesn't have to be complicated.

79
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:52,550
I have to tell you, when I sold
my first business slate, yeah,

80
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:55,050
I sold it to a group that
was private equity back.

81
00:04:55,051 --> 00:04:59,220
And I ran into one of those guys, uh, one
of the bankers years later, and he said,

82
00:04:59,221 --> 00:05:02,130
that group you had,
they were almost cult like,

83
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,290
and I think he said it was sort of
one eyebrow raised like, hmm. They,

84
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:11,460
and I said, why thank you. That's the
guesses. Compliment I've ever received.

85
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,250
Uh, yeah, the apple way, not
the David Koresh way. Perfect.

86
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,310
Exactly.
So the next question,

87
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:25,030
which will seem odd to people listening
but will soon make more sense is it's

88
00:05:27,021 --> 00:05:30,110
not really a question Irma.
I'll be polite and make it a question.

89
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:35,450
Could you please give me your three
minute commercial? Tell me about yourself.

90
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,313
Soup to nuts.

91
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:40,320
All right. Um, moved my entire childhood.

92
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:44,190
So every year from fourth to 12th
grade I was in a different school,

93
00:05:44,191 --> 00:05:46,260
so I was the perpetual new kid.

94
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:50,130
I think what that did is
perfect my ability to stand
on the outside of the room

95
00:05:50,131 --> 00:05:54,030
and look in and really listen,
understand motivations,

96
00:05:54,031 --> 00:05:57,890
understand sort of the dynamic which
served me well later in life at the time I

97
00:05:57,891 --> 00:05:59,720
went kicking and screaming.
Um,

98
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:04,700
I have a love that started very young
in life for what makes businesses great.

99
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,410
So as I went through college,

100
00:06:06,411 --> 00:06:10,760
I was fortunate to have a great business
professor who really cultivated that in

101
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:14,900
me. So I'd have to report to her every
week what my favorite business was, why,

102
00:06:14,901 --> 00:06:16,130
what were they doing differently?

103
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,790
And along that way made a unilateral
decision that I was going to go work for

104
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:23,420
Merck. So she thought I should
probably brought my options.

105
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,930
It wasn't such a slam dunk. I told her,
no, I'm going to work for Merck. Um,

106
00:06:26,931 --> 00:06:29,570
they weren't hiring when I got a school,
but eight months later they were,

107
00:06:29,571 --> 00:06:33,980
and I got the job, called her up a said,
I got that job that you said I might not.

108
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:37,010
And she said, great, we're going
out to dinner and you're buying.

109
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,200
So went to work from work,

110
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:42,530
started in Pharma because it was
fortune's most admired company.

111
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:44,810
That's why I went there
wanting to learn from the best.

112
00:06:44,811 --> 00:06:46,850
I thought I would actually
take it elsewhere and apply it.

113
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:50,300
Didn't really think I was going to be
so fascinated with the science fell in

114
00:06:50,301 --> 00:06:55,040
love with the science and the innovation,
what it could mean in people's lives.

115
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,890
Loved what Pharma had the capacity to do,

116
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,280
hated how they got it done
in the bigger companies.

117
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:05,470
So I made the leap went smaller,
smaller, smaller, smaller, um,

118
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:09,380
until I ultimately was maybe crazy
enough to start it for myself. Uh,

119
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:12,560
built two businesses both
in sexual health people say,

120
00:07:12,561 --> 00:07:15,130
why say Irish Catholic of course.
Um,

121
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:19,820
so built a business late with the only
a long acting testosterone for men.

122
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:24,290
Uh, and that made me on the path of
watching this emergent science for women.

123
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,090
Um,
when the drug,

124
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,030
when this drug was put on the shelf
by the company that invented it,

125
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:32,690
I made a decision to stop it off
and take it on and got the, uh,

126
00:07:32,691 --> 00:07:35,630
only ever drug approved, uh,
for sexual desire in women,

127
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:38,870
sold that business and
now as a pass through,

128
00:07:38,871 --> 00:07:42,590
do nothing but spend my time reaching
my hand back and trying to get female

129
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:45,830
founders there to my kind of outcomes
faster than I got there myself.

130
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:48,620
That was really good.
And how many minutes

131
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:54,860
your listeners will know if I'd use my
spider sense. I think that was really,

132
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:55,850
really close.

133
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:01,130
So I'm very impressed and for people
who are wondering what the hell is Tim

134
00:08:01,131 --> 00:08:04,320
doing? This is the oddest
interview have ever heard him, uh,

135
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:07,880
attempt to give it is because why?

136
00:08:07,881 --> 00:08:10,520
What are the last two
questions have in common?

137
00:08:10,521 --> 00:08:11,870
Why did I ask those two questions?

138
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,470
You asked those two questions because I
love to ask those questions of everybody

139
00:08:15,471 --> 00:08:19,600
I interview cause I think that if
you'll just be quiet and listen, uh,

140
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:21,290
which you heard a little
bit from my background,

141
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:24,170
people will tell you a lot about
themselves and what their motivations are.

142
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:28,880
So that was always probably my initial
question and interviewing and figuring

143
00:08:28,881 --> 00:08:31,820
out from people what they would
tell me about themselves. Okay.

144
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,680
What would you look for or what were,

145
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,590
were there any particular
sort of checkered flags?

146
00:08:37,591 --> 00:08:40,810
Meaning fantastic or red flags?
Meaning hmm,

147
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:43,230
maybe not a good person to pick four.

148
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,070
Me, you know, it was
discomfort with change,

149
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:51,280
the lack of adaptability because in
my environments they were not the same

150
00:08:51,621 --> 00:08:53,600
structure that they might
have been coming from.

151
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:54,770
They were going to have to be nimble,

152
00:08:54,771 --> 00:08:59,771
have to move quickly to keep pace or I
always laid my cards on the table at the

153
00:08:59,881 --> 00:09:03,780
end of interviews and said, here's
who we are, here's this culture. Um,

154
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,990
we both should lay our cards on the
table because six months from now I don't

155
00:09:06,991 --> 00:09:09,480
want us to be unhappy with each other.
Um,

156
00:09:09,481 --> 00:09:13,830
so I think I'm always listening for those
cues that would indicate a fit for my

157
00:09:13,831 --> 00:09:15,960
environment and a,
and in it,

158
00:09:15,961 --> 00:09:19,140
I think I was finding the people
with a love of businesses.

159
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:22,500
I often ask that question,
what is the business that you most admire?

160
00:09:22,501 --> 00:09:24,120
Because they've got to have that passion.

161
00:09:24,121 --> 00:09:26,760
I think particularly in small and startup,

162
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,720
you have to have a real love affair
with what it is that makes things tick.

163
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:35,510
What did you study in Undergrad business?
Yeah.

164
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:40,720
What did your business professor do
besides have you report back each week on

165
00:09:42,951 --> 00:09:44,960
your favorite business of the week?

166
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:47,870
I think she just took a special interest.

167
00:09:47,871 --> 00:09:52,700
I think she saw something there and
cultivated it so that she was pushing me.

168
00:09:52,701 --> 00:09:56,870
So not only did she push me with the
assignment that was above and beyond what

169
00:09:56,871 --> 00:09:58,460
she was asking of everybody else,

170
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:02,650
but I think she also tortured
me a little bit with, um,

171
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:06,080
the doubt to see if I would push through
it. You know, when I said to her,

172
00:10:06,081 --> 00:10:09,680
I'm going to go work for Merck,
she's like, wow, I don't know.

173
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,790
Their science grades aren't that good.
I mean she really sort of pushed back.

174
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:17,810
Like it wasn't such a sure thing. So she
was constantly setting the bar for me.

175
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,770
Did she know, I don't know if you had
a chance to ask her, but once she,

176
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:27,830
did she genuinely think that you would
have trouble getting the job or was it a

177
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:33,291
Yoda trick to get you to
stubbornly then pursue,

178
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,520
pursue it twice as hard?

179
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:37,840
100% of stubborn trek.
Yeah,

180
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:42,150
and I think she knew that I have sort
of a healthy chip on my shoulder of

181
00:10:42,151 --> 00:10:46,670
proving it. Um, so she was definitely
pushing right at that button, um,

182
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:50,730
of, you know, go out there and
prove it. So yeah. Very clever.

183
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:56,280
So how does one start a Pharma
company without a Pharma background?

184
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,720
Well, Pharma background and that I'd
been in the industry for a long time.

185
00:11:01,721 --> 00:11:05,950
So had the right, you know, contacts
had the industry experience. Yes.

186
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:09,790
Without the scientific backgrounds,
right. Surround yourself with it.

187
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,290
Extraordinary scientific team.

188
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:16,150
I feel like I've learned at the hands of
some of the best in science and I think

189
00:11:16,151 --> 00:11:20,020
I've always brought a lens to it of,
you know, what would work in the market.

190
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:23,890
We were sort of a magical pairing
because many times in science you can get

191
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:26,470
enamored in the lab with
youngs and not look out,

192
00:11:26,471 --> 00:11:29,950
tried to what's really going to
work in the mainstream. So it was,

193
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:33,910
it was a lot about having just
a great team. How did you pick,

194
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,920
and I can play a doctor on TV now

195
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,090
or at least think I can,

196
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,080
people's ear buds if they,
that's right.

197
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:52,200
How did you end up choosing the, you
said long acting testosterone. So, uh,

198
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,350
paint a picture for us.
Well,

199
00:11:53,351 --> 00:11:58,240
I mean sure because we can certainly get
into testosterone and like HP Pta and

200
00:11:58,241 --> 00:12:00,270
all this fun stuff up,
but I don't,

201
00:12:00,271 --> 00:12:04,660
I don't want to bore some segment of my
population, uh, of listeners to death,

202
00:12:04,661 --> 00:12:08,140
although I'm fascinated by, so we
probably will get into it. But the,

203
00:12:08,141 --> 00:12:12,010
how did you end up choosing that?
Right. So you have, you want to start,

204
00:12:12,011 --> 00:12:15,460
did it start with finding the opportunity
and then I want to start a company or

205
00:12:15,461 --> 00:12:19,230
do you decide I want to start a company
now let me try to find that product.

206
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,630
Yup.
I wanted to start my own company,

207
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:26,040
so I felt like I had a hypothesis that,
and if you don't mind me asking,

208
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:29,070
how old were you at the time
or where were you in touch?

209
00:12:29,071 --> 00:12:32,900
And I know that I was in my early
thirties at that time. Got It. Oh,

210
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:36,330
when I started it and I had had
one sort of career experience,

211
00:12:36,331 --> 00:12:40,070
it was very informative. So I'd been
at a company that was acquired in this.

212
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,350
They had been gobbled up by somebody who
gobbled up a lot and then they had to

213
00:12:43,351 --> 00:12:45,360
integrate them and I
got to be on that team.

214
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,840
So I got this sort of put
together of the perfect company.

215
00:12:48,841 --> 00:12:52,540
That was a great career moment for me.
Um, and then I got to go apply it in,

216
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:57,330
in doing my own. And the reason I
did it is that for that same reason,

217
00:12:57,331 --> 00:13:01,410
I love Pharma for what it can do at
three m in the morning. If you're sick,

218
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,770
you love Pharma. Yeah. In the
light of day you probably don't.

219
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:08,700
And it's because it is an industry
that has a certain reputation.

220
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,710
I thought there was a way to do it better.

221
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:14,730
And I had the hypothesis that here
I am driven and succeeding in these

222
00:13:14,731 --> 00:13:18,510
environments, but totally uninspired
to have to be other people like me.

223
00:13:18,511 --> 00:13:19,860
What if I got them together,

224
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:23,430
gave them permission to do it on
their own terms and that was slate.

225
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:26,310
I named my company Slade on purpose,
clean slate. We were going to do it,

226
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:30,570
we were going to do it our way and it
was to go out and find a diamond in the

227
00:13:30,571 --> 00:13:34,260
rough and asset that had been overlooked.
I loved the category.

228
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,970
I love sexual medicine.

229
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,270
I'm a card carrying member of
the sexual medicine society.

230
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:43,050
Who knew there was that there is other,
it makes me popular cocktail parties.

231
00:13:43,051 --> 00:13:46,170
I'd like whip it out. No
I it, there really is,

232
00:13:46,171 --> 00:13:50,880
this is a society and it's because like
actually our understanding there has

233
00:13:50,881 --> 00:13:53,280
really come much more recently.

234
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:57,930
Like it's a relatively new field and yet
we're learning such interesting things

235
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,290
and it's in conditions that,
you know,

236
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:03,390
you might not lose your life from them,

237
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:07,380
but you will lose your life as you
know it when you're affected by these

238
00:14:07,381 --> 00:14:09,440
dysfunctions. So found, um,

239
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:14,540
this inventor who had the only FDA
approved long acting testosterone and

240
00:14:14,581 --> 00:14:16,680
interestingly,
how do you find someone like that

241
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,960
you'd think that like in a,

242
00:14:18,961 --> 00:14:23,850
in a world of some of Pharma discovery
that the bones would have been picked

243
00:14:23,851 --> 00:14:24,380
clean?

244
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,480
Yes. Okay. So this is a great story.

245
00:14:26,481 --> 00:14:31,481
So a scientist that I knew from previous
company was quoted in an article.

246
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:36,110
This gentleman reached out to
him. He said, I don't really,

247
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:37,910
I don't know anything about this space,

248
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:40,060
but I know somebody who's
really interested in it.

249
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:46,730
Commercialize was a very fortuitous sort
of introduction and couldn't believe

250
00:14:46,731 --> 00:14:48,200
that this had been overlooked.

251
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:52,580
The reason it had been overlooked is that
almost of this product was being used

252
00:14:52,581 --> 00:14:53,420
off label,

253
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:57,230
meaning that not for its indication
was being used interestingly in women.

254
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,970
So my journey started very
early in this use for libido.

255
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:06,920
It was testosterone and
it was a pellet. So, uh,

256
00:15:06,921 --> 00:15:10,940
it was put it long acting put under the
surface of the skin release testosterone

257
00:15:10,941 --> 00:15:14,670
over of sort of four to six
month window. Yeah. So I,

258
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:17,960
so here's me looking at it
going, hmm. First of all,

259
00:15:17,961 --> 00:15:22,880
it should be used by urologists in
men. I did it, this crossover analysis.

260
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:25,310
Only one neurologist in
the country was using it.

261
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:28,520
So I thought this would be a great
business to build and frankly,

262
00:15:28,521 --> 00:15:32,210
the delivery system is better than
what's available on the market today.

263
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,690
If I thought of something that was custom
made for men, they have to remember,

264
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:39,470
I big brothers, I'm used to
being around guys, you know,

265
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:42,620
they can be sitting on the beach burning
bright red and they still won't put

266
00:15:42,621 --> 00:15:44,240
sunscreen on or rubbed something on.

267
00:15:44,241 --> 00:15:47,030
And the most common application for
testosterone at the time were gels.

268
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,680
So this was like,
Hey,

269
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:51,140
can you remember to show up
three times a year to the doctor?

270
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,280
Yeah, yeah. All right.

271
00:15:54,281 --> 00:15:58,870
So the inventor reaches out to your
friend, the scientist who says,

272
00:15:58,871 --> 00:16:03,620
I can't help you, but maybe my friend
Kat. And that's how it starts. Uh,

273
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,270
and the, uh, so the pellet, how do they
know, I'm thinking of, for instance,

274
00:16:07,271 --> 00:16:10,390
like trembling, which is used in
cattle in some cases also popular,

275
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:15,310
some power lifters and so on, a who do
not use it in pellet form, but how is it,

276
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:19,330
how is it administered or how
is it put into the patient?

277
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:24,070
So put in, in an in office procedure at
the end of it, it requires a bandaid. Um,

278
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:27,660
so there's a device, a Trocar, you go
just under the surface of the skin,

279
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:31,650
set it underneath the skin, put
a bandaid on. And it was, yeah.

280
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:34,830
And for your urologists who are
surgeons, this, you know, in,

281
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,170
in office procedure was very simple.

282
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:40,920
And the great news is it was half
the price of anything on the market.

283
00:16:40,921 --> 00:16:42,990
So everybody was winning in this equation.

284
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:46,690
Why was it half the price?
Just because of the purpose for me.

285
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:52,650
Cause you set the pricing less costly
because you are comparing it to other

286
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:57,520
modes of administration which
require more visits. Tense. It's not,

287
00:16:57,521 --> 00:17:01,910
no, it was just the market
positioning. Yeah. Hmm.

288
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,220
Fascinating.
What was the,

289
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,180
I have sort of a belief system around
that and Pharma about drug pricing.

290
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:10,130
And so it was important to me to do that.

291
00:17:10,131 --> 00:17:13,970
We were making great money building a
great business and we were doing just fine

292
00:17:13,971 --> 00:17:14,804
at that cost.

293
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:19,270
Right, right. You don't
need a 500 million. Yeah,

294
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,740
exactly. Uh, yes. And as, as we
may, we may or may not talk about,

295
00:17:24,741 --> 00:17:29,390
some people get into a lot of trouble
for that. Rightfully so. Yeah.

296
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:34,200
Uh, what other questions do you like to
ask when you're interviewing people that,

297
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:37,970
are there any other questions
that you find yield, uh, are,

298
00:17:37,971 --> 00:17:40,520
are worth the effort that
are particularly helpful or,

299
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,140
or other approaches to hiring?

300
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:45,620
I'm going to go back to silence.
Isn't that I'm going to go back to you.

301
00:17:45,621 --> 00:17:47,480
I do more listening than asking.

302
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:52,140
I asked the one open ended question and
try to see where they'll take me cause I

303
00:17:52,141 --> 00:17:56,580
think I'm getting a lot of insights
into who they are and by doing that,

304
00:17:56,581 --> 00:17:59,340
so I don't think they're,
I don't think there are magical questions.

305
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:04,490
I think there's ways to tease out
cultural fit and that is so important.

306
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:09,330
I care much less about the
resume. Um, the quality, you know,

307
00:18:09,331 --> 00:18:10,740
everybody wants to come
in and impress you.

308
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:14,400
They haven't really hit your
doorstep unless they have the credit.

309
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:16,770
I think to be in there
interviewing for the position.

310
00:18:16,771 --> 00:18:21,000
So I feel like it's my job to really
tease out that cultural fit so that we're

311
00:18:21,001 --> 00:18:22,050
both happy with each other.

312
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:24,520
So culture can mean a lot of things too.
Yeah.

313
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:29,350
To two different people in
this particular case. Uh,

314
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:33,400
and you mentioned the adaptability,
which in a,

315
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:35,080
in a small startup especially,
I mean,

316
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:37,600
you're gonna learn a lot of hats
in those heads. Make Change. She,

317
00:18:37,601 --> 00:18:38,680
you need someone who is adaptable.

318
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:42,100
What else were you looking for
and what did it mean to you?

319
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:46,670
Six things, so minor, minor,
pretty specific looking for, well,

320
00:18:46,671 --> 00:18:48,110
let me say overarching.

321
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:51,170
I'm looking for people who wake up
everyday and make deliberate choices.

322
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,420
It's all a choice, right?
How you go through life.

323
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,110
And mine were my six where they
had to choose to be an owner,

324
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:01,640
maybe highly motivated by that ownership.
Um, they had to choose to be bold.

325
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,440
We're going to make decisions
a little differently.

326
00:19:03,441 --> 00:19:07,370
They had to choose to be quirky because
I needed them to feel that permission to

327
00:19:07,371 --> 00:19:08,660
be individual in my environment.

328
00:19:08,661 --> 00:19:12,110
Most of them are coming out
of environments in which
we, we beat like, you know,

329
00:19:12,111 --> 00:19:15,640
sameness into people and
homogenize the whole group. Um,

330
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:19,610
they did choose to be learning. That's
fundamental to me even as I invest today.

331
00:19:19,611 --> 00:19:23,570
So important to watch what
people do to learn every day. Um,

332
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:27,200
choose to be family. Uh, because
we were going to be a small,

333
00:19:27,201 --> 00:19:29,240
tight knit group and they had
to choose to be appreciative.

334
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:33,470
And I think that that is
how you go through life. You
know, what is your attitude?

335
00:19:33,471 --> 00:19:37,850
Do you sort of marvel at the
opportunity you have to make impact.

336
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:40,760
Um, so those were my six
choices I was looking for.

337
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:45,800
How do you avoid false positives in the
sense that if you ask someone or if you

338
00:19:46,501 --> 00:19:49,450
lay out, if you say to
them, these are the six

339
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:53,250
because it doesn't,
you're,

340
00:19:53,251 --> 00:19:57,450
you're listening to this story that
shows that I think exposes those values.

341
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:01,580
But if you ask somebody that, like if you
choose to be quirky, uh, sure, I cheat.

342
00:20:01,581 --> 00:20:05,520
I mean it, you know, that's a, you're not
going to get, I think the right response.

343
00:20:05,521 --> 00:20:08,820
I think you have to know your
core, who you are and who fits. Um,

344
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,560
and then I think you have
to ask the questions.

345
00:20:10,561 --> 00:20:14,760
I will say there is one other question
I do always ask and I ask how was the

346
00:20:14,761 --> 00:20:16,530
very first way you ever made money?

347
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,060
Oh, I like that. That's a really good one.

348
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:23,480
And, and if they can't, they never,
if they can't tell me, you know,

349
00:20:23,481 --> 00:20:27,290
I put like flyers in the mailboxes in
the neighborhood and said odd jobs called

350
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:31,940
me or if they are like, wow, you know, my
first job out of college was they're out.

351
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:35,840
They don't have that sort of
mentality that's going to fit

352
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,040
one of, one of my friends, um,

353
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:44,050
Brian Johnson who has done a whole
host of very impressive things,

354
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,840
he was the founder,
I don't think he had a cofounder,

355
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:50,120
but let's just say one of the
founders to be safe of Braintree,

356
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:53,710
which then sold for a whole
lot of money. And, uh,

357
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:56,170
when entrepreneurs come to him,

358
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,990
because he invests quite a lot now and
they say they want to start something,

359
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:03,090
he'll ask them, is that an
itch or is that like, is it,

360
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:07,060
is it an itch or is it a burn? And, uh,

361
00:21:07,061 --> 00:21:10,510
and then he'll take them down
that discussion to assess like,

362
00:21:10,511 --> 00:21:15,511
do you really have the sticktuitiveness
and the stubbornness and just the,

363
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:19,930
it can't be any other way with me to
actually make it through this because it's

364
00:21:19,931 --> 00:21:20,950
not going to be all.
