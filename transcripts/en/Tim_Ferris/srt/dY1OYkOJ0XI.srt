00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
[inaudible]

2
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:10,580
travel tips, let's talk about them.
I've traveled to a lot of places,

3
00:00:10,581 --> 00:00:11,840
especially in the last 10 years,

4
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:16,610
something like 40 plus countries and I
have learned a lot about what works for

5
00:00:16,611 --> 00:00:18,230
me at least.
So I'll share a few of them.

6
00:00:18,231 --> 00:00:22,540
Number one for earplugs the
best I have found Max and AC,

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,750
k apostrophe, s silicone
earplugs. These are not foam.

8
00:00:26,751 --> 00:00:28,580
You don't roll them up and
stick them in your ear.

9
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:32,630
You actually affectively
plastered them over the year.

10
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,870
And I was introduced to these
by competitive swimmers.

11
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:37,760
But what's really nice about these ae,

12
00:00:37,761 --> 00:00:41,840
they block more sound at least as
far as I can perceive. Secondly,

13
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:45,320
you can sleep on your side
or something like that.

14
00:00:45,321 --> 00:00:49,940
They do not come out and they do not
poke further into your ear. So I'm a big,

15
00:00:49,941 --> 00:00:54,470
big fan of these earplugs and I have them
in every bag that I might travel with.

16
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:59,290
So I redundancy there.
Next is a ball rub at the SPEC.

17
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:02,660
Looks like a golf ball with tiny
little points on it. Are you be z?

18
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:06,080
And this is for rolling out
your feet before you travel.

19
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:09,890
And when you land and let's say you get
to a hotel, airbnb, whatever it might be,

20
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:14,960
first thing take off the shoes were all
at your feet and this tends to prevent

21
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,030
and alleviate a lot of tension,

22
00:01:17,031 --> 00:01:21,320
not only in the legs and hips but also
in the back for whatever reason. Uh,

23
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:24,720
tip pro tip, if you have
the option, get a massage,

24
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,740
say the date after you land,
not the day you land.

25
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:31,280
For reasons we won't get into
right now and focus on cervical,

26
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:36,370
neck and upper spine and that can also
dramatically reduce or remove any type of

27
00:01:36,651 --> 00:01:40,580
back soreness and so on that was
incurred through travel. Next tip,

28
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:46,150
I always have two particular items for
immune function or supporting in the and

29
00:01:46,341 --> 00:01:48,050
function.
I have sprayable,

30
00:01:48,051 --> 00:01:50,390
zinc and there are many
different types that you can use,

31
00:01:50,391 --> 00:01:53,570
which I'll use probably three
or four times on days of travel.

32
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:58,810
Also I will travel with one gram capsules
or tablets of vitamin C and while I am

33
00:01:59,691 --> 00:02:00,230
traveling,

34
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:05,230
I'll take one gram every hour that
I'm awake and that there's a lot.

35
00:02:05,331 --> 00:02:09,860
So used to a gut tolerance
as they would say.

36
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,180
In other words, don't make yourself
a poo in your pants. Disaster Pants,

37
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:17,960
no Bueno. So you might want to test
that before you're on an airplane.

38
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,270
And then last,

39
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,620
this is perhaps the the a coup de Gras,

40
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:29,680
one of my favorite discoveries in the
last five or six years and it is travel

41
00:02:29,871 --> 00:02:33,830
caching. What does caching mean?
That is from cash, not cash money,

42
00:02:33,831 --> 00:02:36,820
but see a c h e,
right?

43
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,420
And this means that for the
locations I visit most often,

44
00:02:41,421 --> 00:02:44,720
if you look at travel patterns, let's
just say for me within the United States,

45
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:49,610
very often I'm flying to the same places.
Maybe 80 90% of the time.

46
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,010
New York City, let's say
Miami, whatever it might be,

47
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:58,670
I will develop a relationship
with a particular hotel.
All of these hotels have.

48
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,240
Then what I will do is for the
weather in that particular city,

49
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:09,370
I will have seven to 10 days worth
of clothing, including any type of,

50
00:03:09,371 --> 00:03:12,550
say outerwear for New York City.
In the winter one jacket,

51
00:03:12,551 --> 00:03:16,120
we'll do one or two pairs of shoes,
say sneakers for walking,

52
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:19,660
and then something that equates to
business casual or for something a little

53
00:03:19,661 --> 00:03:23,830
more fancy and it lives in New York City.

54
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:28,930
It stays there all the time. How does this
work? Well, I can walk to the airport,

55
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,180
use a clear card,
which I use for everything and I,

56
00:03:31,181 --> 00:03:33,910
I became an advisor to the company
after many years of using it,

57
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,050
which will get me from walking in
the door of the airport to the gate.

58
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,880
Usually in say six or seven minutes.

59
00:03:39,881 --> 00:03:43,180
It's incredibly effective
for skipping security lines,

60
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:48,280
clear card, and then
I walk in, no luggage,

61
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:51,250
maybe a backpack with a laptop
and that's it. I land in New York.

62
00:03:51,251 --> 00:03:54,460
I've everything that I need.
Then at the end of the trip,

63
00:03:54,461 --> 00:03:59,461
I'll also even include say some coconut
oil or almond butter and a sardines and

64
00:03:59,651 --> 00:04:04,150
cans that's picked up from
Dominic D'Agostino. Scientist.
So I have even food,

65
00:04:04,151 --> 00:04:04,580
if I write,

66
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,900
if I arrived late at night or simply
don't want to deal with room service,

67
00:04:07,901 --> 00:04:10,150
I even have some food
that's not likely to expire.

68
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:16,290
I wear this clothing for say a week and
then I pack it up or I don't pack it up.

69
00:04:16,961 --> 00:04:21,640
I just leave it in the room. And because
I am a frequent visitor at the hotel,

70
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:26,320
I asked them to do wash and fold or
clean out of the hotel, pack it up,

71
00:04:26,321 --> 00:04:27,880
put it back in my trunk.

72
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:31,060
So they'll often even give you a trunk
to you as you can buy one for 50 bucks.

73
00:04:31,061 --> 00:04:34,060
But I was given a trunk.
It's not because they know who I am,

74
00:04:34,061 --> 00:04:37,480
it's because I've developed a relationship
and it's cheap for them to help

75
00:04:37,481 --> 00:04:41,620
anyway. Uh, and they will
wash, fold the clothing,

76
00:04:41,621 --> 00:04:44,140
put it back in your trunk,
lock it up, put it in storage,

77
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:47,380
and then it's ready for use the next time.
It's fantastic.

78
00:04:47,381 --> 00:04:49,840
And so you have that not everywhere.
Okay.

79
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:54,940
So it's maybe a few hundred bucks
that you spend and it's in one or two

80
00:04:54,941 --> 00:04:58,300
locations, meaning one or two cities,
and you have everything that you need.

81
00:04:58,301 --> 00:05:03,301
You do not need to pack a single thing
and it's recycled and ready for use the

82
00:05:04,841 --> 00:05:08,020
next time you go there. Uh, that is
a longterm investment. Of course,

83
00:05:08,021 --> 00:05:11,830
it's not for everybody, but for the
cost of one or two plane tickets,

84
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:17,220
you can never pack luggage or never have
to pack luggage again to your two most

85
00:05:17,351 --> 00:05:21,910
common destinations. It's, for me,
at least, an incredibly, incredibly,

86
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:27,270
a fantastic return on investment and has
made my travel life infinitely easier

87
00:05:27,851 --> 00:05:28,990
and more enjoyable.

88
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:34,020
So those are a few tips you can take and
run with good luck and happy traveling.
