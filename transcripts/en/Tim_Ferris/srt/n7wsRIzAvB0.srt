1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,860
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02,861 --> 00:00:06,650
I can run flat out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking it.

3
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,440
I'm a cybernetic organism,
living tissue

4
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:25,360
low.
My kittens.

5
00:00:25,361 --> 00:00:28,600
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to
another episode of the Tim Ferriss show.

6
00:00:28,601 --> 00:00:31,030
I'm testing a new mic,
so if it sucks balls,

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:35,230
please let me know on Twitter Hashtag
suck balls. Otherwise if you'd like it,

8
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:39,070
Hashtag like balls. I'm kidding. Don't do
that. Don't do either. Actually just uh,

9
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:42,730
communicate with me like human on the
interwebs instead of using hashtags.

10
00:00:42,731 --> 00:00:43,564
Thank you very much.

11
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:48,260
The Tim Ferriss show is typically
involved with deconstructing world class

12
00:00:48,261 --> 00:00:52,660
performers, trying to identify
the routines, the tips, the books,

13
00:00:52,661 --> 00:00:57,010
the influences and so on that helped
you to replicate the successes of people

14
00:00:57,011 --> 00:01:00,190
who are the very best at what they do.
Whether they are hedge fund managers,

15
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:05,170
actors and politicians like Governor
Schwarzenegger for instance, uh,

16
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,380
musicians like Mike
Shinoda, blah, blah, blah.

17
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:11,800
Everyone in between chess prodigies,
we've got something for everybody.

18
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:17,100
Now every once in a while I do a Q
and a format where people will vote on

19
00:01:17,921 --> 00:01:22,510
questions, submit an upvote questions just
like you have in the past week or two,

20
00:01:22,511 --> 00:01:27,511
so several thousand people voted on
questions and I have the top 10 to 15 and

21
00:01:28,661 --> 00:01:33,130
I'm going to tackle as many as
I can in the next short stint,

22
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:36,670
the short period that we have together
before I have to run to dinner.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,830
So let me start at the beginning,
but before we jump into the questions,

24
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:46,240
I want to recommend that you
check out my movie picks.

25
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:51,300
I watch a lot of movies and I uncover
some pretty fun ones because I dig very

26
00:01:52,991 --> 00:01:56,590
deep and I searched far and wide
for lots of weird esoteric stuff.

27
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:01,340
If you go to four hour work,
week.com all spelled out, Fou, r,

28
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:04,870
h our etc. Four hour work
week.com forward slash Vimeo,

29
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:09,550
Vimeo as a sponsor and I have
been a member for many years now.

30
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,330
Uh, if you go to four hour
workweek.com forward slash Vimeo,

31
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:18,420
you can find some of the movies
that have been amazing for me,

32
00:02:18,551 --> 00:02:22,870
inspiring game changing or in some cases
life changing. There are some really,

33
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:27,160
really impressive movies. And before
I've spoken about, for instance,

34
00:02:27,161 --> 00:02:29,920
a science fiction short
called world of tomorrow,

35
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:35,250
which was the winner of the grand jury
prize at Sundance for short films and is

36
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:39,640
just a really thought provoking
intense 16 minutes or so.

37
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,160
I've mentioned waking up with Sam Harris,

38
00:02:42,161 --> 00:02:45,280
which is actually a lecture
and effectively a class,

39
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:50,500
which is the perfect tool if you want
to explore mindfulness and meditation.

40
00:02:50,501 --> 00:02:52,840
And for those of you who have
listened to a lot of these podcasts,

41
00:02:52,841 --> 00:02:57,841
you know that perhaps 80%
of the top performers all
have some type of meditative

42
00:02:58,481 --> 00:03:01,780
practice and can differ.
Uh, whether that is,

43
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:06,070
say a Dj or a founder of the glitch
mob all the way to Swartz and anger,

44
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,090
they all have some type of mindfulness
practice. Then you have the,

45
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,140
the act of killing,

46
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:15,340
which is probably the most brutal
innovative documentary I've ever seen. Uh,

47
00:03:15,341 --> 00:03:17,830
and many more. So they, they have, uh,

48
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:22,690
just about anything you can imagine from
documentaries on the revival of manual

49
00:03:22,691 --> 00:03:25,510
work through motorcycles, which is
super cool. You can check that out.

50
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,220
He breakdancing documentary.

51
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:32,550
And the one that I want to highlight
today is a very short film called the lady

52
00:03:33,131 --> 00:03:37,960
in number six. And The lady and
number six is an Oscar winner.

53
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:40,980
It is a short about Alice,
you know,

54
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:45,940
Alice is 109 years old and the world's
oldest pianist and Holocaust survivor.

55
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:51,100
And this short film is
really mind expanding for me.

56
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:54,490
Uh, was mine expanding for
me in a number of respects.

57
00:03:54,491 --> 00:03:59,491
It just shows the importance of mental
framing and also how your perspective can

58
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:05,520
lead to happiness or resentment
at any given point in time.

59
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:10,000
And there are a number of people in the
film who appear besides Alice and you

60
00:04:10,001 --> 00:04:14,680
can look at the, their demeanors and the
contrast and perspectives. It's very,

61
00:04:14,681 --> 00:04:19,230
very interesting. But 109 years old,
very, very sharp, still moving around,

62
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:24,160
playing the piano every day.
I've found it a really enlightening and,

63
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:28,390
uh, engrossing watch. And it's a,
it's only give 20 to 30 minutes long.

64
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,990
So the, the, uh, name again
is the lady and number six,

65
00:04:31,991 --> 00:04:35,530
you can go four hour work week.com forward
slash Vimeo and I will be continuing

66
00:04:35,531 --> 00:04:39,340
to add movies to this page. Uh,
the are not affiliate links,

67
00:04:39,341 --> 00:04:43,480
but I do have a discount for you guys for
any of the films that you might watch,

68
00:04:43,481 --> 00:04:45,020
so you can check that out.
Um,

69
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:49,270
but the subtitle is listened to the
secrets for a long and happy life.

70
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:52,930
So the lady number six, check it
out. It's short. Well worth the time.

71
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:58,000
Go to four hour work week.com. Forward
slash, Vimeo. All right, now moving on.

72
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:01,050
Let's get to the very first
question. Just jump into it. And a,

73
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:05,320
I think I'll spend a good amount of
time on this question and I've omitted a

74
00:05:05,321 --> 00:05:08,740
handful of those that were voted up at
cause I thought the wording was weird or

75
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:12,970
confusing. Um, so the first one I'm going
to tackle is this question from Mike.

76
00:05:12,971 --> 00:05:16,030
In Santa Cruz.
They say blogging 1.0 is dead.

77
00:05:16,031 --> 00:05:20,410
If you had to build an audience from
scratch today, how would you start? Well,

78
00:05:20,411 --> 00:05:23,860
this is a tricky question because, uh, uh,

79
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:27,940
you may be tackling the wrong problem.

80
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,640
And let me explain how I
think about this and just to,

81
00:05:30,641 --> 00:05:33,670
to put things in perspective.
So I have a number of platforms.

82
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:39,010
I obviously have the blog, which
gets somewhere between, I dunno, uh,

83
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:42,510
one and 2 million unique
visitors per month. Uh,

84
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,510
then I have my Twitter and social
Twitter alone gets, I don't know,

85
00:05:46,511 --> 00:05:50,920
1.3 million or so in terms of
followers and then the podcast,

86
00:05:50,921 --> 00:05:54,760
which just hundreds of thousands
per episode and so on and so forth.

87
00:05:54,761 --> 00:05:58,880
So I've tried it all right. I've played
around with any platform you can imagine.

88
00:05:58,881 --> 00:06:02,630
And I live in silicon valley in
invest in tech. Here's my perspective.

89
00:06:02,631 --> 00:06:05,960
So I'll answer your question
somewhat directly in literally first,

90
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:11,330
there is always a market for high quality
and there's always a market for long

91
00:06:11,561 --> 00:06:15,770
form. Okay? I'm going to recommend a
couple of resources right off the bat. Uh,

92
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,280
there's always a market for high quality.
Uh, there's a book called small giants.

93
00:06:19,281 --> 00:06:21,040
I would recommend that you check out.
Uh,

94
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:25,530
and this is to say if you
offer the best of anything, uh,

95
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:30,530
you can charge a premium
and your customers were 10
will tend to be very high

96
00:06:30,531 --> 00:06:32,840
margin,
low headache customers.

97
00:06:32,841 --> 00:06:37,841
So you could say produce the best cigar
in the world or even the top 10% and

98
00:06:38,391 --> 00:06:40,940
charge hundreds or thousands
of dollars per cigar.

99
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,600
You could do the same thing with leather
pants and sell them to people like

100
00:06:44,601 --> 00:06:48,950
Sheryl Crow and only make a couple of
hundred or even fewer per year and make

101
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:50,780
hundreds of thousands or
millions of dollars per year.

102
00:06:50,781 --> 00:06:53,360
That's actually an
example from small giants.

103
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:58,750
This is related to long form and
that's how I interpret blogging.

104
00:06:59,151 --> 00:07:02,810
One Point Oh is writing blog posts and
then having comments on those posts.

105
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:08,150
There's always a market for long form
and people lament the death of long form

106
00:07:08,151 --> 00:07:10,940
the death of this, the death
of that. Oh my God. You know,

107
00:07:10,941 --> 00:07:13,820
TV is going to be the death of radio and
podcasts are going to be the death of

108
00:07:13,821 --> 00:07:15,230
this and this is going
to be the death of that.

109
00:07:15,231 --> 00:07:19,070
And it makes for very
sensational headlines. But, uh,

110
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:22,280
I think it's usually mostly hot air.

111
00:07:22,281 --> 00:07:26,330
So long form.
Here's the advantage of long form content.

112
00:07:26,331 --> 00:07:30,050
And I've always specialized, I think in
long form content, you look at my books,

113
00:07:30,051 --> 00:07:30,771
they're not short.

114
00:07:30,771 --> 00:07:35,771
They're not intended for people who claim
to have short attention spans and many

115
00:07:37,521 --> 00:07:41,810
of my blog posts or 15 pages long,
2030 pages long if you print them out.

116
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:42,920
Uh,

117
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:47,840
and the reason I approach it this way is
because if you're building an audience,

118
00:07:47,841 --> 00:07:52,400
and I'll come back to that
aspect of your question, the,

119
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:57,580
the most labor efficient way to build an
audience over time is to have evergreen

120
00:08:00,171 --> 00:08:05,090
content. So I write long pieces that
will be more valuable from an Seo,

121
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,970
a real estate standpoint,

122
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:12,470
two years from the date I write it
compared to the week it launches,

123
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:17,120
if that makes sense. So were you to
look at my back catalog and the stats?

124
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:21,230
I'm on wordpress VIP. If you were to
look at my stats or Google analytics,

125
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:25,020
you would see that my most
popular posts that get hunt get,

126
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:30,080
get each hundreds of thousands of visits
per month were written several years

127
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:33,900
ago. And that's very much by design.
I'm not upset by that because I,

128
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:37,790
I fully expect that some of the articles
I write this year, for instance,

129
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:40,880
my post on a practical
thoughts on suicide,

130
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:43,790
which is a very intense post,
uh,

131
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:48,820
I expect that will continue to gather
steam and be spread around and shared.

132
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:51,740
And a year from now it will be
right in the top 10 rankings,

133
00:08:51,741 --> 00:08:56,550
which is very important to me.
So the question you asked though,

134
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,130
it has a very, uh, is,

135
00:08:58,131 --> 00:09:01,140
is a multilayered question and there
are a lot of assumptions built into it.

136
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:06,240
So if you had to build an audience
from scratch today, let's examine that.

137
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:11,420
Why do you have to build an audience at
all now the belief right now is you have

138
00:09:12,421 --> 00:09:15,420
to be on social. You have to be putting
out content. I think that's bullshit.

139
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:18,750
You don't have to at all. Amazon
didn't start with building an audience.

140
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,520
Uber didn't start with
building an audience.

141
00:09:20,521 --> 00:09:25,020
If your goal is to create a profitable
or massively scaled business,

142
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:30,090
that may not be the right thing to
focus on. Uh, that's, that's part one.

143
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:35,420
Part two is I encourage you to always ask
yourself why three times when you feel

144
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:41,250
like you have to do something. So you have
to build an audience, ask three times,

145
00:09:41,251 --> 00:09:44,180
and this is something I think
I adopted from Cardo, similar,

146
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:48,210
which is spelled with an Ra,
is a Brazilian entrepreneur
asking why three times?

147
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:51,870
So why do you have to build an
audience? Well, and you might say,

148
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:56,690
because I have to have people to
sell to when I launched my product.

149
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:58,920
Okay, well why do you have
to launch your product? Well,

150
00:09:58,921 --> 00:10:03,690
because I want to build a business
that allows me to the freedom.

151
00:10:03,691 --> 00:10:07,200
Let's just say to travel the world and
have enough income to do a, B, and c.

152
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:09,480
All right,
let's take travel the world.

153
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:14,510
It may turn out once you ask why three
times that volunteering at a local

154
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:19,790
embassy for your target country like
Sweden or someplace else is the shortest

155
00:10:20,731 --> 00:10:24,930
path to getting to your objective,
not building an audience.

156
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:29,310
So don't mistake the intermediate
signposts or not even signposts.

157
00:10:29,311 --> 00:10:33,930
The intermediate steps that you've been
told repeatedly are important as the

158
00:10:33,931 --> 00:10:35,780
goal itself. Uh, and this,

159
00:10:35,781 --> 00:10:38,700
this comes back to a lot of the discussion
in the four hour work week about

160
00:10:38,701 --> 00:10:43,260
multiple currencies and the fact that
that income is only one currency of time.

161
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:48,560
You have mobility and that the value of
that money is determined by the number

162
00:10:48,571 --> 00:10:52,020
of W's you control in your life. You
know, where you live, what you do,

163
00:10:52,021 --> 00:10:53,520
who you spend your time with and so on.

164
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:58,080
And the reality that
income is a barter system.

165
00:10:58,081 --> 00:11:01,380
You are taking this paper or digital,
uh,

166
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:05,880
symbolism basically these
units and trading them for
experiences or possessions.

167
00:11:05,881 --> 00:11:09,510
So there may be more direct
ways like volunteering,

168
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:14,200
like taking a specific job,
uh, any number of things, uh,

169
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:18,600
that could get you to your goal faster
than building an audience because

170
00:11:18,601 --> 00:11:21,780
building an audience, quite frankly,
it's a pain in the ass. It is a,

171
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:25,590
it is not an easy thing and
it requires a very concerted,

172
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:29,190
conscious and well planned effort.
Okay.

173
00:11:29,191 --> 00:11:31,020
Couple of other recommendations,

174
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:36,950
if you still decide to that building an
audience is the right step or the right

175
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,120
place to focus.
A couple of things.

176
00:11:39,121 --> 00:11:43,230
I would suggest read the article
1000 true fans by Kevin Kelly.

177
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:49,020
Uh, this is an important concept to grasp
because you do not want to target the

178
00:11:49,021 --> 00:11:50,850
mass,
the masses.

179
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,670
Your objective should not be to
build the largest audience possible.

180
00:11:54,671 --> 00:11:57,820
It's too vague. It would be too expensive
in terms of cost per acquisition.

181
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:01,120
Even if that cost is measured in the
man hours that you put into creating

182
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:04,330
content. The least crowded
channel is where he should focus.

183
00:12:04,331 --> 00:12:06,940
That's another reason why
I prefer long form content.

184
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:10,570
The least crowded channel
is still long form content,

185
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:13,240
whether that is print or audio.

186
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:16,630
And that is why I am able to
compete effectively. For instance,

187
00:12:16,631 --> 00:12:17,620
in the podcast realm,

188
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:22,540
even though my podcasts are very
minimally produced, I don't have a team.

189
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:26,590
It's me and one freelance engineer
and my assistant. That's it. Uh,

190
00:12:26,591 --> 00:12:31,030
but I can compete against podcasts
that have many, many teams, many,

191
00:12:31,031 --> 00:12:35,230
many people in groups of people
focused on producing a narrative. Uh,

192
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:39,390
partially because I, I go very
in depth with guests. Um, this,

193
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:44,290
this episode of course being
a, an exception, I mean
anomaly few other points.

194
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:48,520
If you're trying to build an audience,
the first place to start,

195
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:51,700
and this is gonna sound funny,
is to look at your credit card statement.

196
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,121
All right?

197
00:12:52,121 --> 00:12:56,050
Look at your monthly credit card
statements and identify where you are.

198
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,630
Price incentives and price insensitive.
Okay?

199
00:12:58,631 --> 00:13:01,660
So you could have a specific
highlighter for that.

200
00:13:01,661 --> 00:13:04,150
Let's just say they're printed out.
Use An orange highlighter, red,

201
00:13:04,151 --> 00:13:08,170
whatever for things that you are price
insensitive about where you could spend

202
00:13:08,171 --> 00:13:10,210
three or four times as much and not care.

203
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:15,610
You should also break things into groups.
Where do you spend $100 a year? Okay.

204
00:13:15,611 --> 00:13:17,110
So obviously you're
going to have to divide,

205
00:13:17,111 --> 00:13:20,740
some things are multiplying them by 12,
but what do you spend $100 a year on?

206
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,990
What do you spend $250 a year on?

207
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:26,920
What do you spend $500 a year on and
what do you spend $1,000 a year on a?

208
00:13:26,921 --> 00:13:29,920
And if you're in a, uh, a
very high income bracket,

209
00:13:29,921 --> 00:13:33,580
then you can multiply those out
obviously. Okay. That's step one.

210
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:36,190
And the price insensitive
aspect is very important.

211
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:39,250
If you want minimal headache from
the customers that you choose.

212
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:43,570
Next you're going to identify the
subcultures that you belong to.

213
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:47,200
What are the subcultures you belong to?
Are you a crossfitter?

214
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:50,290
Are you involved with orienteering?

215
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:53,560
Are you into role playing
games or world of Warcraft?

216
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,570
Do you like particular types of movie?
Are you into Japan animation,

217
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,650
whatever it is,

218
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:04,510
identify three to five sub cultures that
you belong to that you understand very

219
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:08,350
well.
And then for each of those sub cultures,

220
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:13,590
you're going to identify the five
sites that those people go to.

221
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,900
If you had to guess where someone
in that subculture would go.

222
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:19,690
The five sites that they go to regularly,
three to five,

223
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,670
the three to five Twitter accounts,

224
00:14:21,671 --> 00:14:25,060
they're most likely to follow the
three to five Instagram accounts.

225
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:29,050
They're most likely to follow the three
to five Facebook pages they're most

226
00:14:29,051 --> 00:14:33,910
likely to like or be fans of the three
to five podcasts that they're likely to

227
00:14:33,911 --> 00:14:34,571
listen to.

228
00:14:34,571 --> 00:14:38,680
And let's just stop it there and you
don't have to do all of them but SPEC that

229
00:14:38,681 --> 00:14:41,650
out. And what are you doing
by following this process?

230
00:14:41,651 --> 00:14:46,390
What you're doing is defining yourself,

231
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:51,420
your psychographics, your
demographics, and uh,

232
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,490
the,
my,

233
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:57,520
my first recommendation is always going
to be go after markets that you belong

234
00:14:57,591 --> 00:15:01,610
to. So when I launched the four hour
workweek, my objective was initially,

235
00:15:01,611 --> 00:15:03,890
and the target is not
the potential market.

236
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:05,480
This is really important to understand.

237
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:09,410
The target market is
not your total market.

238
00:15:09,411 --> 00:15:11,840
The target market is the tip of the spear.

239
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:16,550
That is what you use at the front lines
to win the battle that then allows you

240
00:15:16,551 --> 00:15:17,151
to win the war,

241
00:15:17,151 --> 00:15:21,470
but you win the war when your target
demographic then expands to include a lot

242
00:15:21,471 --> 00:15:23,900
of other people. In practical
terms, what does this mean?

243
00:15:23,901 --> 00:15:25,160
When I launched the four hour work week,

244
00:15:25,161 --> 00:15:28,280
my objective was very measurable
and what gets measured gets managed.

245
00:15:28,281 --> 00:15:29,330
As Peter Drucker says,

246
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:34,570
I was going after 20,000 sales of
the four hour work week per week two,

247
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:43,270
I think it was 20 to 35 year old tech
savvy males in New York and San Francisco

248
00:15:43,831 --> 00:15:46,760
have predominantly Chicago also.
Um,

249
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:50,480
and this is because I did the homework.
Looking at Nielsen Bookscan,

250
00:15:50,481 --> 00:15:53,360
I had a good idea of what would be
necessary to hit the New York Times

251
00:15:53,361 --> 00:15:56,510
bestseller list.
I knew what type of distribution I needed,

252
00:15:56,511 --> 00:15:59,750
hence the importance of
Chicago and having, uh,

253
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:01,790
not only sales,

254
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:06,791
limited to the coasts and I also knew
that I belonged to this 25 to a 40 year

255
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:15,320
old, is that what I said? 25 to 40 year
old tax haven male demographic. Therefore,

256
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:19,700
I knew how to appear ubiquitous to
these people in a cost effective way.

257
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:23,300
So follow me. I knew that if I
were able to get on at the time,

258
00:16:23,301 --> 00:16:28,301
say Gizmodo tech crunch a Gawker
perhaps and a handful of other sites,

259
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:34,490
then uh, now Twitter was nascent in
this day and Instagram didn't exist.

260
00:16:34,491 --> 00:16:36,470
But if I was able to appear at say,

261
00:16:36,471 --> 00:16:39,380
two or three or four conferences
that these people attended,

262
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:44,210
I could appear as though I'm
spending millions of dollars, uh,

263
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,680
or being recruited by all these companies
in publications around the world when

264
00:16:48,681 --> 00:16:49,250
in fact,

265
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:54,250
I only was targeting a handful in a
very concerted and a surgical way.

266
00:16:55,730 --> 00:17:00,140
Okay. You're not trying to build
the largest audience possible.

267
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:05,000
You're trying to find your 1000 true fans.
So to bring it home,

268
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,470
just review all this stuff.

269
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:11,740
You're trying to find your 1000 true fans
who belong to subcultures and markets

270
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:17,410
you belong to so that you can then design
a product or service that they will be

271
00:17:20,421 --> 00:17:25,400
pricing sensitive to.
And in doing all of that,

272
00:17:25,401 --> 00:17:30,401
finding a handful of outlets or pages
or accounts that you can target.

273
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:37,030
So that you can very cost effectively
appear ubiquitous in a surround sound way

274
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:40,610
when you launch something
important to you. And that is it.

275
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,560
By focusing on the least crowded channel,

276
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:47,900
you can win at surprisingly low costs and
with very elegant surgical approaches.

277
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:51,990
And uh, that is a long answer
to question number one.

278
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,240
So I'm going to go get a glass of water,

279
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:57,030
but hopefully you guys find
that useful and I will be back.

280
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:04,530
Okay, I'm back. You gorgeous, filthy
animals and I'm going to do a speed round,

281
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:08,880
uh, at least to the extent that I can do
a speed round in jam through a bunch of

282
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:09,714
these questions here.

283
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:14,520
The next question is from Mike
M in Hoboken as well as Holly.

284
00:18:14,521 --> 00:18:15,960
Holly asked a very similar question.

285
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:19,680
If you're the average of the five people
you surround yourself with or associate

286
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:23,550
with most, who are those five people
for you? This varies very widely.

287
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,550
It depends a lot on what
my goals are and I'm,

288
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:28,830
I'm not purely pragmatic
about my friends either.

289
00:18:28,831 --> 00:18:30,720
These need to be people
I enjoy hanging out with.

290
00:18:30,721 --> 00:18:35,520
So it's not just for furthering the goal
of averaging out to a higher standard.

291
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:40,290
But, uh, the first few names that come
to mind, uh, currently our Kevin Rose,

292
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:45,480
Josh Waitzkin. So Kevin Rose,
entrepreneur, serial founder
has been on the podcast,

293
00:18:45,481 --> 00:18:47,430
Josh Waitzkin,
known as a chess prodigy.

294
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:51,510
The inspiration for searching for Bobby
Fischer has also been on this podcast,

295
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:56,730
a Garrett camp who a co founder of
Uber Found a cofounder of stumble upon,

296
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,490
et Cetera.
I do a lot of work with him,

297
00:18:59,491 --> 00:19:02,220
but he is not on the podcast
and probably won't be, um,

298
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:06,060
because he doesn't do as much PR as
people like me. Jeffrey Zurawski.

299
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:07,980
So Jay z is his nickname.

300
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:12,690
Jeffrey's Zurawski was a chef featured
in the four hour chef. He was very,

301
00:19:12,691 --> 00:19:15,570
very helpful. We did a lot of
ridiculous things in that book,

302
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:20,580
including the New York City food
marathon where we had something like 26.2

303
00:19:20,581 --> 00:19:25,581
dishes in 24 hours over God knows
how many different locations and uh,

304
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:33,340
suppose right now, 65 year
old or older, 60 year plus,

305
00:19:33,341 --> 00:19:35,890
let's just say 60 or plus very fit dudes.

306
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:41,220
So older guys who are in incredible
shape who I have trouble keeping up with,

307
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:46,270
I'm really making a study of their
longevity and just general life practices

308
00:19:46,271 --> 00:19:49,820
that lead to that type of existence.
And then lastly, I'd say the,

309
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:53,290
the the Rick Ruben's of the world to
Rick Rubin, legendary music producer. Uh,

310
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:57,520
he was recently on the
podcast, very zen, very calm,

311
00:19:57,521 --> 00:20:01,720
very unflappable. And I wouldn't say any
of those things come naturally to me.

312
00:20:01,721 --> 00:20:05,140
So that is the short answer to
that question. Next question.

313
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:07,840
This is from Barry in Glasgow.

314
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:10,750
Based on the self experiments
you conducted in your books,

315
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:13,900
are there any habits you continue
to implement on a daily basis?

316
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:17,470
And I would expand the
experiments in the books too.

317
00:20:17,471 --> 00:20:19,840
Also the blog and elsewhere
and there are plenty,

318
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:23,230
there are tons that I continue to follow,
uh,

319
00:20:23,231 --> 00:20:28,231
whether that's using cold baths as well
as heat exposure to facilitate sleep.

320
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:29,970
Uh, there was, uh, uh,

321
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:35,150
a piece that was put on the blog with
doctor Rhonda Patrick about using Saunas

322
00:20:36,011 --> 00:20:39,490
and heat for growth hormone increase.
You can check that out.

323
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:42,670
Journaling in the morning.
I use the five minute journal,

324
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:46,150
which was inspired by the
four hour workweek. In fact,

325
00:20:46,151 --> 00:20:49,450
the people who created read the book and
then created the five minute journal.

326
00:20:49,451 --> 00:20:50,830
So that's a nice virtuous cycle.

327
00:20:50,831 --> 00:20:54,010
But I use the five minute journal
typically in the mornings,

328
00:20:54,011 --> 00:20:57,670
although I tried to do it at night
as well as a way to focus my day.

329
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:03,090
The no complaint experiment that I
wrote about on the blog sometime ago.

330
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:06,430
Go trying to go 21 days
without complaining.

331
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:10,270
And the parameters for that is something
that I'm experimenting with right now

332
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:14,050
and that involves wearing a bracelet
that can be swapped from rooster wrist.

333
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:18,490
The training program in
effortless superhuman in the
four hour body is something

334
00:21:18,491 --> 00:21:22,820
that I follow, uh, generally
on and off depending on,

335
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:23,770
on what my goals are.

336
00:21:23,771 --> 00:21:26,500
But if strength is the goal and there's
almost always a component of that,

337
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:32,340
the sex chapters, those,
those get good use. Uh,

338
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:36,490
hopefully more and more use.
But those are in the four hour body,

339
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:41,740
the four hour work week I would say.
And certainly slow carb.

340
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:43,990
The silica have died. I've been following
for something like 10 years now,

341
00:21:43,991 --> 00:21:47,530
although I'm in a in a ketogenic
experimentation phase at the moment.

342
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,820
Then you have the four hour work week
and I use stuff from all of these books.

343
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:54,880
So many of the recipes and the four
hour chef, sexy times steak and so on.

344
00:21:54,881 --> 00:21:57,040
I use all the time,
four hour workweek,

345
00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:00,790
80 20 principle and analysis automation,
autoresponders,

346
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:03,160
all of that stuff is
implemented on a daily basis.

347
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:08,190
Just had a phone call with one
of my right hands yesterday.

348
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,750
Going through and rank ordering
a bunch of things and we'll,

349
00:22:10,751 --> 00:22:14,790
we'll get to some of that in a later
question and in fact we'll get to in the

350
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:18,220
next question,
which is from Arturo in Mexico.

351
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:21,070
What is the most important question
you ask yourself every day?

352
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:24,820
Closely related to the last question and
I think that question has to be which

353
00:22:24,821 --> 00:22:28,270
of these,
and these are the items on my to do list.

354
00:22:28,271 --> 00:22:29,560
So if you have a to do
list in front of you,

355
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:34,030
which of these if done make
the rest easier or irrelevant.

356
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:36,790
This is something that I've
asked for many, many years,

357
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:38,500
but we're really looking for,

358
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,750
and I don't think I'm the
only person to call it this,

359
00:22:40,751 --> 00:22:45,130
but looking for the lead
domino. Uh, so the, the, the,

360
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:49,120
the domino at the front
that once tipped over,

361
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:53,890
we'll help make all the others happen
automatically make them all much easier to

362
00:22:53,891 --> 00:22:55,630
do or make them irrelevant.

363
00:22:55,631 --> 00:22:59,050
So if you have multiple say revenue
goals and they're one that could have a

364
00:22:59,051 --> 00:23:04,051
disproportionate Roi for the
number of hours invested,

365
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:09,240
then that may make three or four other
revenue options irrelevant if that's

366
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:14,380
going to potentially comprise 80% of
what you would make from that entire two

367
00:23:14,381 --> 00:23:18,670
list, for instance. So which of these if
done makes the rest easier or irrelevant?

368
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:22,360
Another question I ask a lot is, which
of these makes me the most uncomfortable?

369
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:26,370
And it's hard to define
important. I know that this, this,

370
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:31,860
it can get very complex very quickly
trying to define what is most important.

371
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:35,860
And, uh, I will spit spend time
talking about that term right now,

372
00:23:35,861 --> 00:23:38,380
but instead of trying
to define certain terms,

373
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:42,010
you can just ignore
them or leave them out.

374
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:45,460
And that solves a lot of problems.
And we talked about sort of the, the,

375
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:49,060
the trouble with the word success in
the four hour workweek for instance. Uh,

376
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:53,390
but you can ask which of these makes me
the most uncomfortable and that from 80

377
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:57,940
20 analysis if done is
going to reduce anxiety, uh,

378
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:00,320
and improve quality of life,
the greatest potentially,

379
00:24:00,321 --> 00:24:03,320
and that often correlates to what
you would consider important.

380
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:06,650
So if you don't know what
the most important thing is
to do on your do to list,

381
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:08,503
find the one,

382
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:12,340
find the item that makes you the most
uncomfortable and that's probably it. Uh,

383
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:12,951
next question.

384
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:16,520
If you could make one thing mandatory in
the nationwide high school curriculum,

385
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,310
what would it be? This is, uh, from, uh,

386
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:23,580
also from Mike and Santa Cruz who's
pretty good voting on his questions. Uh,

387
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:28,100
so this is a potentially long conversation
about the first one may be some

388
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:33,130
unexpected and that is mandatory sports
to keep kids occupied and focused and

389
00:24:34,371 --> 00:24:38,360
improving themselves from three to 6:00
PM. That's known as the danger zone,

390
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:42,740
a for afterschool programs. But when
kids have idle hands from three to six,

391
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,990
often before their
parents get off of work,

392
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:49,190
that's when a lot of kids go off the
rails. So I think mandatory sports,

393
00:24:49,191 --> 00:24:53,510
which I had in high school starting in
sophomore year, I just thought it was,

394
00:24:53,511 --> 00:24:57,500
it was very powerful as a
tool. All right, next question.

395
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:03,510
This is from Jerry a and Philadelphia.
Bruce Lee said the quote,

396
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:07,300
the successful warrior is the average
man with laser like focus and quote.

397
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:09,290
What methods do you practice to maintain,

398
00:25:09,291 --> 00:25:12,140
focus and follow through to achieve your
goals rather than getting sidetracked,

399
00:25:12,141 --> 00:25:14,120
distracted or discouraged?
Uh,

400
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:18,920
first point that I'll make in answer
to that is that I do get sidetracked,

401
00:25:18,921 --> 00:25:22,820
distracted and discouraged. Uh,
there's a post I wrote called,

402
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:26,930
I think it's productivity hacks for the
neurotic, manic depressive and crazy.

403
00:25:26,931 --> 00:25:29,720
And then in parentheses, like
me. So if you just search, uh,

404
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:34,260
productivity hacks for the neurotic,
uh,

405
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:38,540
and then my name will pop right up just
to give you an accurate picture of what

406
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,540
my days and weeks look like.
So number one,

407
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,910
don't expect that you're going
to eliminate that stuff 100%.

408
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:46,520
That's setting yourself up for
failure or feeling like a failure.

409
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:48,770
You're going to get sidetracked,
distracted and discouraged.

410
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:52,820
The question is what can you do to
minimize that or more importantly,

411
00:25:52,821 --> 00:25:55,670
because the goal isn't minimizing,
getting sidetracked,

412
00:25:55,940 --> 00:26:00,230
the goal is getting really big things
done or getting things done that have

413
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:03,500
outsized returns and results,
right?

414
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,540
So there are a couple of things
that I find very helpful.

415
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:08,180
Number one is a chrome
extension called momentum.

416
00:26:08,181 --> 00:26:11,780
This will prevent you from getting lost
on the Internet display is a beautiful

417
00:26:11,781 --> 00:26:15,830
photo with a quote and then your
most important task for the day.

418
00:26:15,831 --> 00:26:17,690
And we already talked about important,
so I won't Belabor it,

419
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:20,000
but the momentum extension for chrome,
check it out.

420
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,480
The next is thinking of my day is
split into maker period and manage your

421
00:26:26,481 --> 00:26:29,060
period. And there's a great
essay by Paul Graham called,

422
00:26:29,061 --> 00:26:31,910
I think it's just the maker's schedule
versus the manager's schedule,

423
00:26:31,911 --> 00:26:33,760
something like that.
Uh,

424
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:38,330
up until about lunchtime
or early afternoon,

425
00:26:38,331 --> 00:26:40,360
I tried to produce content,
uh,

426
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:45,480
and focus on writing or recording
audio answered questions like this for

427
00:26:45,481 --> 00:26:47,760
instance. And then after lunch, uh,

428
00:26:47,761 --> 00:26:52,320
where my brain is typically dialed down
in terms of Rpms after eating. Anyway,

429
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:56,280
I try to focus on the administrative
stuff, the managing the conference calls,

430
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:59,520
the making the trains run on time stuff.

431
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,950
And then the five minute journal I
already mentioned that helps me to keep

432
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:10,020
somewhat focused and the follow through
is related to that since you do a recap

433
00:27:10,021 --> 00:27:14,310
and a postmortem on your day every
evening for a few minutes. Next question,

434
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:18,090
scooter from silly valley.
I don't know if that is a real place,

435
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:20,910
but I kinda like the name
silly valley question.

436
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,910
With all the misleading
information on health out there,

437
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:27,420
what are the best or most reliable
resources? This is very tough question.

438
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:32,400
What I would say is as Richard Fiman
would say, a physicist and a hero of mine,

439
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:36,510
uh, the most important thing is not to
trick yourself and you are the most,

440
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:41,130
you are the easiest person or not to
fool yourself and you are the easiest

441
00:27:41,131 --> 00:27:43,410
person to fool. Something
along those lines. Uh,

442
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,630
there's a book called bad
science that you should read.

443
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:50,670
A bad science is written by an MD named
Ben Goldacre and it teaches you how to

444
00:27:50,701 --> 00:27:54,090
parse good science from bad science,
uh,

445
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:58,380
and to learn how to evaluate
headlines in the news that are usually

446
00:27:58,381 --> 00:28:03,381
sensationalist or written by people who
don't understand how to read studies

447
00:28:03,901 --> 00:28:06,230
properly and perhaps a bit of both.
Uh,

448
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:11,480
and I did take some excerpts from that
and created a appendix or I should say

449
00:28:13,081 --> 00:28:16,320
bonus chapter in the four hour body
that goes through a lot of this.

450
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:18,690
So you can check that out too
if you have a copy of the book,

451
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,810
the condensed a lot of that at
the back of the four hour body.

452
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:25,320
But you need to educate yourself so
that you can separate fact from fiction,

453
00:28:25,321 --> 00:28:28,320
good science from bad science, good
studies from bad studies, et cetera.

454
00:28:28,321 --> 00:28:31,170
And it doesn't take that long.
You can in an afternoon, uh,

455
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:35,580
for most people double your ability to
be intelligent about evaluating all of

456
00:28:35,581 --> 00:28:40,020
the stuff that gets thrown at you.
Mostly noise, very rare signal. Um,

457
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:44,400
but, uh, that is that.
All right. Let's see, uh,

458
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:46,230
the next question I'm gonna answer is,

459
00:28:46,231 --> 00:28:49,350
what are your top 10 natural
supplements that you found most helpful?

460
00:28:49,351 --> 00:28:54,351
And I want to answer this question because
I am of the mind now that you want to

461
00:28:55,471 --> 00:28:58,560
minimize supplementation because
supplements should be supplements.

462
00:28:58,561 --> 00:29:03,450
Unless you have a clear deficiency
that you cannot fix through diet, uh,

463
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:07,020
you should attempt to fix it through diet,
optimize through diet.

464
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:11,580
And there are a couple of easy
ways to do that. I like to, uh,

465
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,980
so there are foods that I can
see them regularly. For instance,

466
00:29:13,981 --> 00:29:16,740
I mean coconut oil, Brazil
nuts, et cetera. Uh,

467
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:21,150
I try to consume a diet that
includes a spectrum of colors.

468
00:29:21,151 --> 00:29:24,600
So I will often order
food or get for instance,

469
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:29,580
materials from a salad bar based on
getting as wide a spectrum of different

470
00:29:29,581 --> 00:29:30,510
colors as possible.

471
00:29:30,511 --> 00:29:33,630
I think that allows you and helps you to
cover a lot of bases. And then the last,

472
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,760
uh, there's a supplement I
use. I've used it for years,

473
00:29:35,761 --> 00:29:37,830
talked about it in the four
hour body athletic Greens,

474
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:42,370
which is kind of my insurance policy
to cover things that I hit. Um,

475
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,430
but there are,
I would never take 10 supplements.

476
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,790
And natural is really a,
uh,

477
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:54,420
a dicey distinction or description
because natural does not mean good,

478
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:59,080
does not mean safe. A hemlock
is natural, it'll kill you. Uh,

479
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:03,460
natural and synthetic are not
always great distinctions,

480
00:30:03,461 --> 00:30:07,690
but whole food supplements, supplements
derived from whole food, uh,

481
00:30:07,691 --> 00:30:10,720
I think are generally,
uh, all things equal,

482
00:30:10,721 --> 00:30:12,820
which they never are
better than synthetic.

483
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:17,830
But also if you're doing something like
a recombinant human growth hormone,

484
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:19,361
right,

485
00:30:19,361 --> 00:30:22,450
you want human growth hormone that's
been synthesized and not pulled out of

486
00:30:22,451 --> 00:30:25,270
cadavers, they're more dangerous
with the latter than the former.

487
00:30:25,271 --> 00:30:28,060
So that is a long way
of saying I don't use,

488
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:31,380
I try not to use any supplements all
the time because you develop tolerance.

489
00:30:31,381 --> 00:30:34,820
Is there feedback mechanisms
that can screw up your own, um,

490
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:40,560
endogenous or sort of a production in
your own body by over supplementation?

491
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:45,430
So I'm trying to go whole foods whenever
possible athletic Greens when I feel

492
00:30:45,431 --> 00:30:47,620
like I'm probably not covering
my bases are traveling on.

493
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:51,820
Next question from chase in Kentucky.
Uh,

494
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:56,020
and his question is what are the things
you've done to become a better writer?

495
00:30:56,230 --> 00:31:00,100
Uh, I still don't, I'm not
satisfied with myself as a writer.

496
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:03,430
I think I'm a better
teacher than I am a writer.

497
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:08,460
So that has a lot to do with how I format
the sequencing of things in my books

498
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:12,790
and simplification of things.
But a couple of things.

499
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:16,630
Number one is read outside of your genre.
So even if you're a nonfiction writer,

500
00:31:16,631 --> 00:31:20,260
read good fiction, don't
become a bigot. A genre wise.

501
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:23,860
Couple of books I found very helpful on
writing with Stephen King's simple and

502
00:31:23,861 --> 00:31:27,070
direct, uh, on writing well by,

503
00:31:27,071 --> 00:31:29,980
I can never pronounce his last name.

504
00:31:29,981 --> 00:31:33,880
I think it's William Zinsser winner on
the psychological game of writing and

505
00:31:33,881 --> 00:31:38,620
just actually getting past your own
head, uh, and insecurities to right.

506
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:42,650
I think that bird by bird is one
of the best books out there. Uh,

507
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:46,360
if you can't find a professor
or someone who has a, a,

508
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:48,190
a writer per se,

509
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:53,050
to proof or review your writing,
uh,

510
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:56,620
then find a lawyer,
find a lawyer to look at your stuff,

511
00:31:56,621 --> 00:32:00,910
even if they're not a good writer, so to
speak, or don't consider themselves such,

512
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:05,410
they're very good at removing
extraneous words or nebulous words. Uh,

513
00:32:05,411 --> 00:32:10,300
so that, that is a tip. And then,
uh, get into the practice of writing.

514
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,850
Uh,
so I use morning pages.

515
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:16,900
You can use any number of different types
of journals if you just search what my

516
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:19,360
morning journal looks
like and then my name,

517
00:32:19,361 --> 00:32:21,220
what my morning journal
looks like in my name.

518
00:32:21,221 --> 00:32:23,710
You'll see examples of how
I do that. And the, uh,

519
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:27,520
the specific journal that I use just
to get into the habit of writing for

520
00:32:27,521 --> 00:32:30,410
yourself. They're not
intended for publication. Uh,

521
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:33,940
and then when I am having my
material proof read by people,

522
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:39,620
my general rule is if one person
loves something, it stays in.

523
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:42,500
So I only need a vote of
one to keep something.

524
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:47,390
But if one person hates something
that's not enough to get rid of it.

525
00:32:47,391 --> 00:32:51,230
So I need a consensus to remove something.

526
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:56,900
Uh, but I only need one person to love
something for me to keep it in or have to

527
00:32:56,901 --> 00:33:01,610
strongly, strongly consider keeping
it in. Uh, and that is that for now.

528
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:03,560
I'm sure there are other things,
but those are the ones that come to mind.

529
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:09,230
Next question. This is at proposal idea.

530
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:13,550
Alright. From Kentucky, we all have
times when he, when we need a brain dump.

531
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:17,180
What are your guilty pleasures for those
times when your brain needs a rest?

532
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:20,750
So I think of brain dump is just
getting a lot out of your head in a

533
00:33:20,751 --> 00:33:22,970
brainstorming session without editing.

534
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,120
But let's assume I'm
answering the second part,

535
00:33:26,121 --> 00:33:29,270
which is when my brain needs a rest,
what do I do? Uh, I like hand drumming.

536
00:33:29,271 --> 00:33:32,990
I have a gem bays, which is Dj e. M. B. E.

537
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:38,050
I have a hand pan, which is kind of
like a steel drum turned inside out. Uh,

538
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:41,410
I also watched serial
television. Um, but it's,

539
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,610
it's not appointment viewing,

540
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,340
I'm downloading say true
detective or something like that.

541
00:33:46,341 --> 00:33:49,250
And then watching each
episode, the jinx. Also,

542
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:52,760
it's just coincidence that both
those are very, very dark. Uh,

543
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,380
the something a little lighter.

544
00:33:54,381 --> 00:33:59,330
I read fiction and I actually really
like reading kids' books or young adult

545
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:04,070
books because I think the books that are
really well written and stand the test

546
00:34:04,071 --> 00:34:06,650
of time in the young
adult category or just,

547
00:34:06,651 --> 00:34:10,030
well written books don't have a lot
of extraneous bullshit or you know,

548
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,470
$10 words when a 10
cent word will suffice.

549
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:16,580
And I think the just very well written
a wrinkle in time is one that was gifted

550
00:34:16,581 --> 00:34:17,990
to me,
uh,

551
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:22,460
not too long ago and recently read
that and just loved it. It was a,

552
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:27,230
it was a really fun read
and a very relaxing to read
before bed to turn off the

553
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:29,860
problem solving apparatus in my own mind.
Uh,

554
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:34,130
so that is my answer for the brain dump.

555
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:38,650
Taking a rest. Those are a few
things that I find very helpful. Uh,

556
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,520
and then there are a
bunch of questions here.

557
00:34:40,521 --> 00:34:45,110
I'm just going to answer one more and
then get going and let you guys get back

558
00:34:45,111 --> 00:34:45,651
to your day.

559
00:34:45,651 --> 00:34:50,420
So bleak you and you can charge
forth and conquer worlds.

560
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:55,360
Uh, last question from Jamie.
This is a oh boy could Asha Sta,

561
00:34:55,610 --> 00:35:00,560
UK, Gloucester, I don't
know how to pronounce it. G.
L. O. U. C. E. S. T. E. R.

562
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,590
It's like worst to tire sauce,
Worcester sauce.

563
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:06,200
I can't ever pronounce those damn words.
In any case,

564
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:08,780
what would you go back and
tell your younger self?

565
00:35:08,781 --> 00:35:12,710
I've thought about this a lot in my answer
for a long time was, you know, nothing,

566
00:35:12,711 --> 00:35:15,190
I wouldn't change anything because these,
these questions are related.

567
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,260
What would you change if you
could go back to age 20 or 25,

568
00:35:18,261 --> 00:35:20,330
what would you do differently?
The very close related,

569
00:35:20,331 --> 00:35:22,760
the only thing that I've
been able to think of,

570
00:35:22,761 --> 00:35:27,110
and this is only very recently that I
realized this is start meditating. Uh,

571
00:35:27,111 --> 00:35:30,950
I think that I would recommend to
myself that I start meditating earlier.

572
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:33,220
I've talked about this
quite a lot. Um, in a,

573
00:35:33,221 --> 00:35:38,221
in 80 plus percent of the
people I interview for the
podcast are all world class

574
00:35:39,301 --> 00:35:43,670
performers, best of the best, have some
type of meditative practice. And um,

575
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:47,880
there are some very good books related to
that. Uh, wherever you go. There you are.

576
00:35:47,881 --> 00:35:50,550
I think it is Jon Kabat Zinn.
Uh,

577
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:55,560
there's also a book called
radical acceptance by Tara
Brock that I like a lot.

578
00:35:55,561 --> 00:35:59,550
Vrac h that's, that covers
more than just meditation. Um,

579
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:03,810
and then, uh, last but not least, I,

580
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:07,380
well I should say I practice
transcendental meditation
and Vipassana Meditation,

581
00:36:07,381 --> 00:36:09,900
but there are many different
types of trends. Tm,

582
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:12,720
transcendental meditation is just tm.org.
You can find info there.

583
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:13,980
There's things I dislike about it.

584
00:36:13,981 --> 00:36:16,800
I think it should be much less
expensive to get training,

585
00:36:16,801 --> 00:36:21,420
but that's what I needed. Iee, someone
to hold me accountable to get into it.

586
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,210
Other things,
apps like headspace and called very,

587
00:36:24,211 --> 00:36:26,690
very good for getting started and,
uh,

588
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:29,160
do less than you think
you can do for meditation.

589
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:31,170
This is key for a lot
of behavioral change,

590
00:36:31,171 --> 00:36:35,850
but if you think you can sit for
10 minutes, do it for five, uh,

591
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:39,330
give yourself a margin for
error and for frustration.

592
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:42,510
So if you think you can do
15 minutes, great, do 10, uh,

593
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:46,530
but do what will allow you
to win in the beginning.

594
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:50,430
The habit is more important than hitting
home runs every day in the beginning.

595
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:51,301
Uh,

596
00:36:51,301 --> 00:36:56,010
and then last I will
say check out waking up.

597
00:36:56,230 --> 00:37:00,980
Uh, this is the, the lecture
by Sam Harris who is, is,

598
00:37:00,981 --> 00:37:05,610
is just an incredible human being.
A phd in neuroscience friend of mine.

599
00:37:05,611 --> 00:37:08,640
He's also on the podcast. And, uh,

600
00:37:08,641 --> 00:37:13,230
waking up is an outstanding
introduction and, uh, and uh,

601
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:17,850
collection of instruction really
related to meditation. Uh,

602
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:22,180
so sort of a guide to spirituality
without religion as his subtitle. But, uh,

603
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:24,540
waking up is a great video.
You can check it out,

604
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:28,620

brain dump and relaxing,

607
00:37:35,581 --> 00:37:40,230
you can also find other things that I've
watched before bed or on the weekends

608
00:37:40,231 --> 00:37:43,710
to chill out like the greasy hands,
preachers. Uh, they're all there.

609
00:37:43,711 --> 00:37:48,330
Shake the dust valley uprising,
a world of tomorrow, maiden trip,

610
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:52,770
etc. Act of killing, not so relaxing,
but a fantastic documentary. Nonetheless,

611
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:54,840
the most brutal thing probably
you will ever watch in your life.

612
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:57,210
