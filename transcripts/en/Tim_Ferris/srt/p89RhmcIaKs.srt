1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,040
I'm looking at your stamp, the hunk over
your name and they'll, it looks like,

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:08,440
so it looks like it's Jean
was something, right? Well,

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:09,570
I don't know how to say your last name

4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:14,990
right? I can't, I don't know
one of your 50 language.

5
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:19,250
I can't, I can't. Pretty good. I
can't spot the other character.

6
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,790
What is your choice? You know,
it's because it's kind of a old,

7
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:26,360
it's kind of an ancient calligraphy,
older calligraphy,

8
00:00:26,361 --> 00:00:28,250
so it's way as in way phone,

9
00:00:28,251 --> 00:00:31,370
like bravery or valor.

10
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,580
My father was,
he was a nationalist,

11
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:39,610
so it basically says my paternal
Haim and then national valor

12
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:41,950
national valor

13
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:46,150
optimal at this altitude,

14
00:00:46,151 --> 00:00:49,300
I can run flat out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking.

15
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:56,890
I'm a cybernetic organism.

16
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:07,240
This episode is brought
to you by trunk club.

17
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:12,160
I hate shopping with a passion.
Going shopping for fun to me is like,

18
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:16,120
let's go do our taxes. I don't get
it. It's something that I have to do,

19
00:01:16,121 --> 00:01:18,790
but I don't like it at
all and quite frankly,

20
00:01:18,791 --> 00:01:21,970
I'm not good at it and I always end up
looking like I'm colorblind or homeless

21
00:01:21,971 --> 00:01:22,804
or something like that.

22
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,960
So Roi really sucky and as a result
I decided to try trunk club and I,

23
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:30,850
I expected to dislike it quite frankly.

24
00:01:30,851 --> 00:01:35,800
But here's how it works and here's why
I'm now a huge fan and just as a prelude,

25
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:37,570
the items that I kept from them,

26
00:01:37,571 --> 00:01:41,980
I've had more compliments from random
women on like t shirts and shorts and

27
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,280
these funky green shoes
that I got than ever before,

28
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,920
which proves that I don't know
what I'm doing. And they do.

29
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:52,660
You go to trunk club.com forward slash
Tim, you answer a couple of questions,

30
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:55,660
then you get assigned a personal stylist.
So mine was Robin.

31
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:59,290
Then they send you a trunk full of
awesome stuff that they predicted you will

32
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:03,370
like and look good in based on
your sizes, preferences, et Cetera,

33
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,770
that they've covered in
this short phone call.

34
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:09,970
It was really short and to the point then
this trunk is delivered to your home.

35
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:13,120
It's free of charge both ways.
So you only pay for clothes that you keep.

36
00:02:13,121 --> 00:02:14,380
If you keep none of them,
that's fine.

37
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,600
You mail the whole thing
back with a prepaid label.

38
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:20,620
They even include tape to shut the box
and you're good to go cost you nothing.

39
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,190
There's no ongoing subscription.
This is not a subscription service.

40
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,700
So only when you ask for a
trunk you will get a trunk.

41
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:31,270
And I expected to keep
maybe two items out of 18.

42
00:02:31,271 --> 00:02:32,530
I didn't want a thousand
things sent to me,

43
00:02:32,531 --> 00:02:35,980
so I got about eight things sent
to me and expect it to keep too,

44
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:39,400
because they give you a preview online
to show you what's coming and end up

45
00:02:39,401 --> 00:02:43,690
keeping four. And I've been traveling with
those. I've a very minimalist luggage,

46
00:02:43,691 --> 00:02:46,600
but I've been traveling for a couple of
weeks and I've brought everything with

47
00:02:46,601 --> 00:02:50,500
me because it's been so multipurpose
and so well received. Uh,

48
00:02:50,501 --> 00:02:54,580
it's kind of blowing my
mind quite frankly. So trunk
club.com forward slash Tim,

49
00:02:54,581 --> 00:02:58,210

the way they make money is really easy.

51
00:03:02,231 --> 00:03:05,860
I mean they buy high quality clothing
at volume and they just charge you the

52
00:03:05,861 --> 00:03:09,490
normal retail pricing. But obviously
they buy it at a cheaper price.

53
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:13,030
So there's no tricks, no hidden costs. Uh,

54
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,420

man in the room or on the street.

It is a good Roi. And for someone
who's always hated fashion,

00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:42,730

63

64
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,850
This podcast is brought
to you by Mizzen and main.

65
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,700
Don't worry about the spelling.
All you need to know is this.

66
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:56,830
I have organized my entire life around
avoiding fancy shirts because you have to

67
00:03:56,831 --> 00:04:01,090
iron them. You sweat through
them, they smell really easily.

68
00:04:01,091 --> 00:04:02,230
They're a pain in the ass.

69
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,540
Mizzen and main has given me
the only shirt that I need.
And what I mean by that,

70
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:11,860
and Kelly Starr at loves the shirts
as well, is that you can trick people.

71
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:15,610
They look really fancy so you can take
them out to nice dinners, whatever,

72
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:18,760
but they're made from athletics,
sweat wicking material.

73
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:22,720
So you can throw this thing into your
luggage in a heap or on your kitchen table

74
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:27,490
like I did recently, and then pull it out,
throw it on with no irony, no steaming,

75
00:04:27,491 --> 00:04:28,324
no nothing.

76
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:32,500
Walk out and you could probably wear
this thing for a week straight or make it

77
00:04:32,501 --> 00:04:36,970
your only dress shirt and take it on
trips for weeks at a time. Never wash it.

78
00:04:36,971 --> 00:04:39,070
It will not smell.
You will not sweat through it.

79
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,990
You got to check these things out.
So go to four hour work,

80
00:04:41,991 --> 00:04:43,890
week.com all spelled out,
four hour work,

81
00:04:43,891 --> 00:04:46,420
week.com forward slash
shirts check it out,

82
00:04:46,421 --> 00:04:50,620
four hour workweek.com forward slash
shirts and you'll see some of my favorite

83
00:04:50,621 --> 00:04:55,570
gear, including the one shirt that
I've been traveling with. What's that?

84
00:04:55,571 --> 00:04:57,250
My Little Munchkins.
This is Tim Ferriss.

85
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,170
Welcome to another episode
of the Tim Ferriss show.

86
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:03,400
I've been waiting to record this intro
in this God damn garbage truck keeps

87
00:05:03,401 --> 00:05:04,750
backing up.
So fuck it.

88
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:07,210
We're going to roll with it and
make that part of the ambiance.

89
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:12,250
The Tim Ferriss show is where I attempted
to deconstruct world class performers,

90
00:05:12,251 --> 00:05:17,080
whether they are chess prodigies,
hedge fund managers, athletes, artists,

91
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:21,160
comedians, celebrities, actors,
you name it, scientists.

92
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,990
We dig into everything.

93
00:05:22,991 --> 00:05:27,280
And the reason is you find that
there are say morning routines.

94
00:05:27,281 --> 00:05:29,080
There are meditative practices,

95
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:33,940
there are types of nutrition and training
that transferred across all of these

96
00:05:33,941 --> 00:05:34,421
domains.

97
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:39,370
It's pretty amazing that you find
a common toolkit for excellence.

98
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:44,350
And in this episode we have Jimmy
Chin. And I remember at one point, uh,

99
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:48,760
Jimmy was kind of introduced to me
conceptually by someone who said if Chase

100
00:05:48,761 --> 00:05:52,360
Jarvis, the world class
photographer and Laird Hamilton,

101
00:05:52,361 --> 00:05:55,630
arguably the biggest big wave surfer
of all time, that's a biggest,

102
00:05:55,870 --> 00:06:00,620
the best big wave surfer of all time
had a love child. It would be Jimmy.

103
00:06:00,621 --> 00:06:03,500
And I was like, what the hell does
that mean? Well, Jimmy is an artist,

104
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:04,970
any professional athlete,

105
00:06:04,971 --> 00:06:09,080
often at the same time as a nat Geo
National Geographic photographer,

106
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,160
he has participated in,

107
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:13,580
in documented breakthrough expeditions
around the planet from climbing first

108
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:17,270
ascents in the character rom to skiing
first descents in the Himalayas,

109
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,320
put another way.

110
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:23,410
He is one of the few people to both
climb Everest to the summit and then ski

111
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,200
down from the summit,
which is bonkers.

112
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,340
Most recently he filmed the directed an
incredible feature documentary called

113
00:06:31,341 --> 00:06:33,140
Meru, m e R, U,

114
00:06:33,141 --> 00:06:37,940
which is in theaters right now and one
the 2015 audience award at Sundance.

115
00:06:37,941 --> 00:06:38,840
So what is Mary,

116
00:06:38,841 --> 00:06:43,220
I'll put this in perspective for folks
in the high stakes game of big wall

117
00:06:43,221 --> 00:06:47,750
climbing. The Shark's fin on mountain
marrow is, I suppose the ultimate prize.

118
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:50,180
Everest is a cakewalk by comparison,

119
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,750
sitting at the headwaters of the
Ganges River in northern India,

120
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:57,500
the shark's fin has seen more failed
attempts by elite climbing teams.

121
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,400
These are the best of the best over the
past 30 years than any other ascent in

122
00:07:01,401 --> 00:07:04,190
the Himalayas or the
[inaudible] as they say.

123
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:09,490
And this movie is a story of one
group's journey to conquer it.

124
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:14,320
And, uh, there are many mishaps
along the way and it's a,

125
00:07:14,321 --> 00:07:18,260
it's a white knuckle quest of friendship,
sacrifice, hope and obsession.

126
00:07:18,261 --> 00:07:22,880
How the hell Jimmy captured it on film
while simultaneously risking his life is

127
00:07:22,881 --> 00:07:25,370
impossible for me to fathom,
but we dig into it.

128
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,030
So in this episode of the podcast,
we talked about his origins training,

129
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:33,030
nutrition gear, and tackling
mirror, of course, uh,

130
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:37,160
which just really blows my mind
and I don't say that lightly.

131
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,460
So suffice to say, if you want to
benevolent kick at the ass, go see marrow.

132
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:43,490
That's your assignment.
I saw it with my family and uh,

133
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,930
for probably 15 minutes afterwards,
all they could say was, Whoa, whoa.

134
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:52,760
Over and over again. My
refrain was holy shit, under my
breath, muttering, you know,

135
00:07:52,761 --> 00:07:56,500
20 times every hour or [inaudible].

136
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:00,470
It's really mind boggling, which Jimmy
pulls off. It's amazing, terrifying, and,

137
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,190
and awe inspiring and
inspiring at the same time.

138
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,840
So that further ado,

139
00:08:05,841 --> 00:08:09,530
please enjoy my conversation
with the incredible Jimmy Chin.

140
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,470
Jimmy, welcome to the show.
Thank you. Nice to be here. It's,

141
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:20,830
it's really been an interview that I've
struggled with how to tackle because

142
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,290
when I watched is it Meru or Maru,

143
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:29,090
I don't know how to emphasize the
name of this. I say marrow marrow.

144
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:33,680
So it was basically 90 minutes of saying,
oh my fucking God. Oh my fucking God.

145
00:08:33,681 --> 00:08:36,740
Oh my fucking God. So I feel like, uh,

146
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:40,180
most of the questions that I would have
formulated during that time might've

147
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,120
been hijacked,

148
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:45,530
but we're going to of course talk
about that and many other things.

149
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:49,700
But when you are asked by people, what
do you do, how do you answer that?

150
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:54,710
Because you have been described by
a friend of mine as, as the love.

151
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,130
If there were

152
00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:00,960
one of Laird Hamilton and Chase Jarvis,
which I thought was hilarious since, uh,

153
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,900
both have been on,
both have been on the podcast,

154
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:09,230
both Amazing World Class Performers
in surfing with layered in many other

155
00:09:09,961 --> 00:09:12,330
things.
And then photography with chase.

156
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,830
And I don't want the image in my head
of them actually doing anything sexual.

157
00:09:16,831 --> 00:09:21,210
But how do you answer the question?
What do you do? Because you do so much.

158
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:26,580
Yeah, sorry, I was picturing
something terrifying actually. But

159
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:31,860
um, I feel like chase would, would
really get the worst end of that.

160
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:36,720
It'd be, um, you know,

161
00:09:36,721 --> 00:09:41,721
that's a question I get
asked often and it's,

162
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:46,920
you know, it's kind of amazing
that I still don't have a
very good answer for it.

163
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:52,140
I generally break it down into three
pieces. I'm a professional athlete,

164
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:57,380
I am a photographer and I'm a film
maker and that's kind of divided by,

165
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,780
you know, my sources of
income. So I guess that's,

166
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,450
that's the best way that
I can describe what I do.

167
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:12,350
And an athlete kind of entails
everything from corporate speaking to,

168
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:18,480
you know, endorsement of
product or a brand ambassador,

169
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:23,280
or working on rd and d
with designers on jackets,

170
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:23,561
you know,

171
00:10:23,561 --> 00:10:28,561
so they kind of spread through
a lot of different areas.

172
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:33,740
When I say athlete and the photographer
is both commercial and editorial work

173
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:38,610
and filmmakers kind of the same, you
know, documentary filmmaking and,

174
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,110
and commercial work as well.

175
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,360
It not for those people who may not
be familiar with your work, what,

176
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,330
what would the,

177
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:50,820
the Jimmy Chin highlight reel look like
when you're introduced by a friend at a

178
00:10:50,821 --> 00:10:52,770
party who's had a couple of drinks,

179
00:10:52,771 --> 00:10:55,290
and so it was very
enthusiastic when they want,

180
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,840
when they want to really catch
someone's attention with some of your

181
00:10:57,841 --> 00:11:01,080
accomplishments. What are the
things that they throw out? I'd say,

182
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,890
Oh wow. I mean, you
mean flattering ones or.
