1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,820
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02,821 --> 00:00:06,140
I can run flat out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,540
I'm a cybernetic organism.

4
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:23,940
Is podcasts

5
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:27,240
brought to you by Mizzen and main?
Don't worry about the spelling.

6
00:00:27,241 --> 00:00:28,410
All you need to know is this.

7
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:33,600
I have organized my entire life around
avoiding fancy shirts because you have to

8
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:37,830
iron them. You sweat through
them, they smell really easily.

9
00:00:37,831 --> 00:00:39,000
They're a pain in the ass.

10
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:43,410
Mizzen and main has given me
the only shirt that I need.

11
00:00:43,411 --> 00:00:46,350
And what I mean by that and Kelly
Starr at loves the shirts as well,

12
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,600
is that you can trick people.

13
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:52,350
They look really fancy so you can take
them out to nice dinners, whatever,

14
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,530
but they're made from athletics,
sweat wicking material.

15
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,490
So you can throw this thing into your
luggage in a heap or on your kitchen table

16
00:00:59,491 --> 00:01:03,570
like I did recently, and then pull
it out, throw it on with no ironing,

17
00:01:03,571 --> 00:01:04,980
no steaming,
no nothing.

18
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:09,270
Walk out and you could probably wear
this thing for a week straight or make it

19
00:01:09,271 --> 00:01:13,740
your only dress shirt and take it on
trips for weeks at a time. Never wash it.

20
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:15,840
It will not smell.
You will not sweat through it.

21
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:17,250
You got to check these things out,

22
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,130
so go to four hour work

25
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:30,420
My favorite gear, including the one
shirt that I've been traveling with,

26
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:37,350
this episode is brought to you by 99
designs or one stop shop for all things

27
00:01:37,351 --> 00:01:38,910
graphic design related.

28
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:43,920
I've used 99 designs for everything
from banner ads to book covers,

29
00:01:43,921 --> 00:01:47,640
including sketches and mock ups
that led to the four hour body,

30
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:51,600
which later became number one New York
Times Number One Wall Street Journal and

31
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:52,463
the brainstorming.

32
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:55,770
A lot of it took place with designers
from around the world and here's how it

33
00:01:55,771 --> 00:02:00,000
works. Whether you need a t
shirt, a business card, a website,

34
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,550
an APP thumbnail,
whatever it might be,

35
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:06,300
you submit that project and
designers from around the world.

36
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,940
We'll send you sketches
and mock ups and designs.

37
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,600
You choose your favorite and you have an
original that you love or you get your

38
00:02:12,601 --> 00:02:14,340
money back.
It's that straightforward,

39
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,030
and many of you who are listening have
already used it and created some amazing

40
00:02:18,031 --> 00:02:20,400
things that I'll be sharing it in
the future. But in the meantime,

41
00:02:20,401 --> 00:02:23,400
if you want to see some of my
competitions, some of the book covers,

00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,370
that's 99 designs.com forward slash Tim.

45
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,780
Hello Ladies and germs.

46
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:40,980
This is Tim Ferriss staring out through
my window at the eucalyptus trees

47
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,960
swaying in the breeze,

48
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:45,990
but that's enough poetry for this
episode of the Tim Ferriss show.

49
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,940
The Tim Ferriss show,
of course,

50
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:52,970
like every other episode is intended
to help you deconstruct excellence,

51
00:02:52,981 --> 00:02:57,210
world class performers to
pull out the tricks, routines,

52
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:00,850
habits, books, et
Cetera, that you can use,

53
00:03:00,851 --> 00:03:03,670
you can emulate to improve
results in your own life.

54
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:08,730
And guests vary from hedge fund traders
to that does make any sense at all.

55
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:14,070
Hedge fund managers to top performing
angel investors to people like Arnold

56
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:18,310
Schwarzenegger on the Celebrity
Front chess prodigies.

57
00:03:18,311 --> 00:03:21,310
And in this case we have not only a chef,

58
00:03:21,311 --> 00:03:26,311
but a a chef plus policymaker plus
would be professional athlete.

59
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,430
His name is Sam Kass.
Sam is a fascinating guy.

60
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:34,660
He went from getting a
history major at u Chicago.

61
00:03:34,661 --> 00:03:37,810
Before that he was on the
professional baseball track,

62
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:43,020
then became private chef for the Obamas
and then ended up the senior policy

63
00:03:43,211 --> 00:03:46,060
advisor for nutrition at the White House.
Uh,

64
00:03:46,061 --> 00:03:51,061
he ran or help to run as
executive director the let's
move campaign which used

65
00:03:52,481 --> 00:03:56,770
private sector partnerships to pursue
the goal of reducing childhood obesity to

66
00:03:56,771 --> 00:04:01,771
just 5% by 2030 and for that he was named
number 11 on Fast Company magazine's

67
00:04:01,931 --> 00:04:05,590
2011 list of the 100 most creative people.

68
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:09,850
And it's such a multifaceted story.
Sam is a,

69
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,960
a hilarious storyteller and there are
a lot of really concrete takeaways.

70
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:19,230
The book that he could not recall offhand
in this episode is a history of world

71
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:25,050
agriculture by Marcel
[inaudible] and Lawrence Roux,

72
00:04:25,051 --> 00:04:27,970
Dar or Rwe Dart, r. O. U. D. A. R. T.

73
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:31,690
So in addition to the art of fielding
auto lendees books and some of the others

74
00:04:31,691 --> 00:04:35,500
that he mentioned, there you have
it, a history of world agriculture.

75
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,180
So now without further ado,

76
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:42,210
please enjoy my conversation and
our conversation with Sam Kass.

77
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:50,420
Sam, welcome to the show. So good to
be here, man. I'm, I'm excited. Yeah,

78
00:04:50,421 --> 00:04:51,530
it's uh,
it's,

79
00:04:51,531 --> 00:04:56,531
it's an interview that I've been really
looking forward to and I am very,

80
00:04:56,571 --> 00:05:00,650
very hopped up on caffeine. This is
that, this is a, an Amish morning for me.

81
00:05:00,651 --> 00:05:01,484
I know this is,

82
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm usually a 10:00 AM 11:00 AM kind of
guy because I'm a night owl and a lot,

83
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,040
so I'm going to jump into some
morning questions in a second.

84
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:13,940
But I wanted to first congratulate
you on the James Beard Foundation,

85
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:17,450
the leadership awards. Uh, thank
you. Uh, yeah, that means a lot.

86
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:20,720
It's a James Beard has been an
incredible, uh, organization.

87
00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:25,580
I mean they are like the, the, the, like
that, you know, the Oscars for chefs and,

88
00:05:25,581 --> 00:05:28,460
but they've taken up a lot
of the important issues
around food and nutrition and

89
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:32,570
health and sustainability. So you
have a, an award for that and yeah,

90
00:05:32,571 --> 00:05:34,830
it's a great honor. I'm
excited. Yeah. It, uh,

91
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:38,540
so for those who don't know the
leadership awards, and this is a,

92
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:39,830
from their website quote,

93
00:05:39,831 --> 00:05:43,610
recognize specific outstanding
initiatives as well as bodies of work and

94
00:05:43,611 --> 00:05:44,990
lifetime achievement.
So that's,

95
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:48,560
that's a hell of a tag line and
we're going to get into all that.

96
00:05:48,561 --> 00:05:52,490
But first a very important
question. Uh, eggs.

97
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:56,900
How do you prefer to make eggs
in the morning? So actually,

98
00:05:56,901 --> 00:05:58,310
I've eating a lot of eggs,

99
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,390
uh, these days. And you know, the eggs
are one of the hardest things to cook.

100
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,750
Some of the great chefs in the world,
their actual, their tests for new cook,

101
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:09,470
we'd be, how to make an omelette
would be like their one master test.

102
00:06:09,471 --> 00:06:13,430
So I actually liked eggs all ways.
Almost always soft though.

103
00:06:13,431 --> 00:06:14,810
So either a soft boiled egg,

104
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,460
I'll do eggs over easy or
really soft scrambled eggs. Um,

105
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:24,790
and I guess the, the, the trick for
soft scrambled eggs is I, uh, you know,

106
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,800
have to get your butter nice. Not, I
cracked the egg straight into the pan,

107
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,710
let them cook for a second
and then mix them up.

108
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,690
And then before you think they're done,

109
00:06:32,691 --> 00:06:36,950
take them out because they'll harden a
little bit as they sit on the plate. Um,

110
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,890
but, uh, I'll, I'll eat eggs
pretty much any, any way.

111
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:44,150
And do you, are you a tea guy,
a coffee guy? None of the above?

112
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:48,840
Uh, uh, both, all of the above. I
do a, I'll do coffee in the morning,

113
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,240
but we'll half and half and then,
uh,

114
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:54,570
either a little coffee in the
day or a tea and then I'll,

115
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:58,650
I'll definitely have some tea at night.
Um, some camomile tea or mint tea or some,

116
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,050
but, uh, yeah, I drink them both.

117
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:04,160
How do you, do you have
any particular, like, uh,

118
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:07,930
do you have any particular type of coffee
or a way of prepping or is it just,

119
00:07:07,931 --> 00:07:11,950
you know, what, just treated as fuel,
whatever will get me through the day.

120
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,070
Hmm. You know, I,

121
00:07:14,071 --> 00:07:17,820
I wouldn't say that I'm like one of
those coffee like lunatics who like,

122
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,260
you know, as wild, you know,

123
00:07:19,261 --> 00:07:23,220
about every specific thing and talks
about it like wine, but I appreciate it.

124
00:07:23,221 --> 00:07:26,340
Good Cup of coffee and I really,
one of my least favorite things.

125
00:07:26,341 --> 00:07:31,260
Is it terrible cup of coffee? Uh, yeah,
I just, I can't, I can't drink it.

126
00:07:31,261 --> 00:07:35,600
So I'm a big stump town guy.
You know, blue bottle does
a great cup of coffee. Um,

127
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,260
there's,
there's some really good coffee out there.

128
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:41,730
So I do French press in the morning. Real
simple, some half and half. Um, nothing,

129
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:42,683
nothing crazy.

130
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,990
What does the,
well,

131
00:07:44,991 --> 00:07:48,350
actually I'm going to ask the the morning
routine question a little bit later on,

132
00:07:48,351 --> 00:07:50,750
but you mentioned a coffee snobs,

133
00:07:50,751 --> 00:07:54,710
and this is kind of a good segue
because you live in Brooklyn,

134
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,490
but you came from a town that is actually
really well known for coffee these

135
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:02,720
days. Just Chicago. Yeah.
And correct me if I'm wrong,

136
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:05,350
I could get some of my bio incorrect.

137
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:09,920
But you grew up with parents who
were both teachers, is that correct?

138
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:15,060
Uh, my dad's a teacher. Um, was
growing up? Well he was actually a,

139
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:17,500
he worked in the Ford factory when
I was very young. And then he,

140
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:20,100
then he changed jobs to become a teacher.

141
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:23,460
And my mom has been an education
like science education stuff,

142
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:26,700
the more from like museums and now she's
at the National Science Foundation. So,

143
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:29,940
but lots of teachers,
my and uncle are teachers.

144
00:08:29,941 --> 00:08:33,810
My cousins are teachers and my sister's
a teacher. So I am, we come from,

145
00:08:33,811 --> 00:08:35,550
I come from an educational family.

146
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,230
What was, uh, what was that
like growing up? I mean,

147
00:08:38,231 --> 00:08:40,360
how did that impact you or affects you?

148
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:45,890
Um, I, it probably was more of the,
how I pushed back against it then,

149
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,950
how it is that that was probably
the strongest influence.

150
00:08:48,951 --> 00:08:53,510
I wanted to be a professional baseball
player from the time I was like three all

151
00:08:53,511 --> 00:08:56,490
the way through college
to be honest. And, uh,

152
00:08:56,491 --> 00:09:00,510
I went to junior college trying to make
it to the major league. So I, I, you know,

153
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:04,980
as my parents pleaded with me to dig
into the books and hit them harder,

154
00:09:04,981 --> 00:09:09,090
all I wanted to do was take batting
practice. And, and, and she, you know,

155
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,320
go after some fly balls. So
I, it came back to me when I,

156
00:09:13,321 --> 00:09:15,810
when I transferred in
college and then beyond.

157
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,690
Did the,
do you have brothers and sisters?

158
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:21,690
I have a younger sister who's
still in Chicago. Got It.

159
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:26,460
And you ultimately in college
ended up at U Chicago.

160
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:31,320
Uh, and what, what drew you
to baseball? Why did you,

161
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,640
why did you play baseball?

162
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:37,800
Um, so I love, I love baseball for a
number of reasons. One, it is so hard.

163
00:09:37,801 --> 00:09:38,311
I mean if you,

164
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:42,840
if you are successful 30% of
the time for your whole career,

165
00:09:42,841 --> 00:09:45,720
you'll be a hall of famer. That means
if you fail seven out of 10 times,

166
00:09:45,721 --> 00:09:47,670
you're one of the greatest players
in the history of the game.

167
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:53,190
And so that constant challenge and
constant challenge to get better.

168
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:56,360
Something that, you know, always
really drew me. It's also, you know,

169
00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:00,380
it's a team sport, so you have
the camaraderie that is, you know,

170
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:04,040
really powerful and those bonds with,
with, with your teammates. But it's,

171
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:07,710
it's also an utterly individuals
sports. So unlike, you know,

172
00:10:07,711 --> 00:10:10,770
soccer or basketball where if have
it a bad game, you kind of blend in.

173
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:14,190
If you make an error and baseball are,
you strike out with the bases loaded,

174
00:10:14,191 --> 00:10:17,440
everybody knows like you messed up.
And so you really have to take account,

175
00:10:17,441 --> 00:10:20,160
you know, responsibility and you're
held accountable for your actions.

176
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:23,910
And I think that those kinds of
lessons of discipline, hard work,

177
00:10:23,911 --> 00:10:26,760
but also accountability
and learning how to fail.

178
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:31,380
And even if you failed five times in a
row, that sixth time you get a shot at it,

179
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,360
maybe the most important
time can win the game.

180
00:10:33,361 --> 00:10:37,200
And how do you mentally prepare
yourself to walk into that moment?

181
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:41,700
Clearheaded and, and not carrying the
baggage from the previous failures,

182
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,030
which could impede your ability
to be successful when it mattered.

183
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,800
Like those are the kinds of things
that I just loved about baseball and,

184
00:10:47,801 --> 00:10:51,450
and it really served me well and,
and all other aspects of life.

185
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:56,910
And you had a, you had a very good
batting average. I believe it's, uh,

186
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:57,480
it,

187
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:02,480
I've read that it was ranked among the
best in program history at a University

188
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,953
of Chicago.
Is that accurate?

189
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,900
Um, yeah. I haven't checked recently.

190
00:11:05,901 --> 00:11:09,050
I'm sure some of the younger guys
that have taken over. I, when I left,

191
00:11:09,051 --> 00:11:12,350
I think I was number three, but you
know, it was, it wasn't the, you know,

192
00:11:12,351 --> 00:11:15,540
we were of c for the education,
not, not, not uh, the baseball,

193
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,160
but we had a very good team.
Um,

194
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:19,430
and I played two years of
junior college baseball,

195
00:11:19,431 --> 00:11:24,140
just trying to get drafted where
basically all I did was play ball a six,

196
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:26,930
six hours a day,
seven days a week literally,

197
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:31,400
and sprint training in the morning. Like,
you know, it was, that's all we did.

198
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:36,230
So u of C was a little different. It
was a two hours a day, five days a week.

199
00:11:36,231 --> 00:11:40,190
And I'll never forget the first practice
when coach outlined our schedule and

200
00:11:40,191 --> 00:11:43,190
said that on Thursdays we didn't
practice cause we had science labs.

201
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:47,030
I just almost like passed out.
I didn't even know what was talking,

202
00:11:47,031 --> 00:11:50,750
talking about science labs,
not baseball. So it was a,

203
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:53,030
it was an adjustment for me. Um, but, uh,

204
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,540
but it was one of the greatest thing
and probably the best decision I've ever

205
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:56,440
made was to go there.

206
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,830
Well, like you said, I mean if
you go to say Iowa for wrestling,

207
00:12:00,831 --> 00:12:03,600
I mean wrestling is your
career in college, uh,

208
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:05,840
academics are secondary,

209
00:12:05,841 --> 00:12:08,960
but it u Chicago you have obviously
very strenuous academic program.

210
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:13,961
What did you do that other players didn't
do that allowed you to not only make

211
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:18,950
it through u Chicago and the academics,
but to have that high,

212
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,530
a batting average for
that good batting average?

213
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:26,220
Um, that's a good question.
I'm not exactly sure I know
a definitive answer that,

214
00:12:26,221 --> 00:12:26,790
I mean,

215
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:31,790
I had come from such a rigorous baseball
background and where a lot of the other

216
00:12:32,011 --> 00:12:33,630
guys were, you know, came from, you know,

217
00:12:33,631 --> 00:12:37,860
we're sort of playing baseball
secondarily that, um, you know,

218
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,510
that part came really easy
to me. Uh, and, um, you know,

219
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:45,630
I think the part that was
a real adjustment that I
could learn from them was

220
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:48,960
like how to really hit the books in a
way that I had never had to hit the books

221
00:12:48,961 --> 00:12:53,480
before. And how do you organize
all that class work and you know,

222
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:56,400
the expectation that you're supposed
to read like five books a week? I mean,

223
00:12:56,401 --> 00:13:00,690
I mean, that was like absurd to
me, uh, going in. So, you know,

224
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:05,310
I learned from them about how to balance
that side of it and from my side,

225
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:06,810
um,
you know,

226
00:13:06,811 --> 00:13:10,890
I think the discipline and how you
efficiently use your time both in the,

227
00:13:10,891 --> 00:13:13,440
you know, in the gym, in batting practice,

228
00:13:13,441 --> 00:13:16,390
like how do you make the most
of what you're, you know,

229
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,960
what you're trying to get out of it.
Um,

230
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,300
I think was something that I
could bring to the guys and,

231
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,610
and was able to be
successful on both sides.

232
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,050
And the,
the,

233
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:30,300
the major you ended up choosing
was history. Did, was that a,

234
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,030
was that an immediate choice?
Did you know you wanted to do history?

235
00:13:33,031 --> 00:13:34,020
How did you arrive at that?

236
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:38,380
Um, you know, I looked, I looked
at a couple other majors, um, uh,

237
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,460
but I ran the history because,
you know,

238
00:13:40,461 --> 00:13:43,790
at the time there's a lot of things
swirling in politics. There's a lot of,

239
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,830
you know, there's a lot of work
there. There's like, you know,

240
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,870
the first Gulf War and there's
a lot of things going on that,

241
00:13:48,871 --> 00:13:52,520
that I was paying attention to that
I didn't really understand what was

242
00:13:52,521 --> 00:13:55,640
happening. Uh, and um, and I,

243
00:13:55,641 --> 00:13:59,870
and I realized that if I wanted to
understand the world around me in politics

244
00:13:59,871 --> 00:14:04,280
and everything that was happening,
having a, uh, a much better grasp on, on,

245
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:07,880
on history and where these things
have come from was going to help me.

246
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:11,150
And I think that that really propelled
me to, to focus in on history, which,

247
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:13,580
which I love. I'm a, I'm a history geek.

248
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:17,730
Do you have any favorite
history books or biographies?

249
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:22,390
Oh man, that's so tough. That's so tough.

250
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:23,770
I Dunno if I have one.

251
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,950
I'll tell you like I like some obscure
ones and I got to get you the author.

252
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:28,390
But there's like,

253
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:31,540
there's a history of agriculture book
that completely changed my perspective and

254
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:34,060
it's kind of boring. But
when you look at, you know,

255
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:37,300
if you're a geek and you look at like the
impact of simple tools have had on our

256
00:14:37,301 --> 00:14:39,580
society,
the transformational shifts,

257
00:14:39,581 --> 00:14:43,360
like we forget how fundamental that stuff
is. So I'll get back to you on that.

258
00:14:43,361 --> 00:14:46,120
There's so many great biographies
and great history books.

259
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:49,190
Cool. Yeah, the, the, uh, I'll put the,

260
00:14:49,191 --> 00:14:51,830
the title of the book and
so on in the show notes.

261
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:54,420
So we'll come back to that.
Uh,

262
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,050
how did you then,

263
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:02,150
this is kind of the missing piece in
that the Sam Kass puzzle that I haven't,

264
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,400
uh,
immediately been able to figure out.

265
00:15:04,401 --> 00:15:09,401
How did you go then from majoring
in history at U Chicago to food?

266
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,080
How did you become interested in food?

267
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:17,600
So I had always, um, sort
of love food. You know, as a
kid I kind of liked to cook,

268
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,920
um, but it had no notion of ever, you
know, pursuing it professionally at,

269
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:26,810
in any way. Um, and when I
was at UFC, my friend, uh,

270
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:30,530
was the sous chef at this restaurant
in, in, uh, in Chicago. And I,

271
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,860
I didn't know him super well, but I
said, all, you know, one day, you know,

272
00:15:33,861 --> 00:15:36,710
I think I'll go to culinary school when
I'm old and just so I can learn how to

273
00:15:36,711 --> 00:15:40,800
cook for like my kids and wife whenever
they decided to show up. And he was like,

274
00:15:40,801 --> 00:15:41,750
you know, well, don't do that.

275
00:15:41,751 --> 00:15:45,250
Just come in and hang out at
the restaurant and see what
you think. So I went in,

276
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:50,000
it was like an Italian American, uh, spot
in Chicago, nothing, you know, nice place,

277
00:15:50,001 --> 00:15:53,690
nothing too fancy. And um, and I loved it.

278
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:57,320
And so I ended up just
showing up and like, you know,

279
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:01,970
and potatoes and hanging out and trying
to learn some things. And the chef said,

280
00:16:01,971 --> 00:16:06,100
well, if you're going to keep showing
up, I guess I got to pay you. So I'd,

281
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:09,350
so he did. But I mean, it was pretty
much an unmitigated disaster. Like,

282
00:16:09,351 --> 00:16:12,880
I knew nothing and they, you know,
but I always work hard. So they,

283
00:16:12,881 --> 00:16:17,600
they threw me on the line to work the
Pasta Station and Oh my God, it was,

284
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:21,080
you know,
the dishes that the chef let me send it.

285
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:25,730
The table most often came back cause they
were just on that overall, uh, so it,

286
00:16:25,731 --> 00:16:28,130
you know, so I guess it
was a rough start. Um,

287
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:32,360
but so I had that one summer and then
I finished u of C and I had one one

288
00:16:32,361 --> 00:16:36,080
semester left and I kind of kicked
my way into an abroad program. I got,

289
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:39,110
I got wait listed and then
sort of, um, pleat and made a,

290
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:43,820
a strong plea with the Dean to let me,
uh, let me into one of the programs.

291
00:16:43,821 --> 00:16:47,120
I didn't care where, where we
went, where I went and went to,

292
00:16:47,121 --> 00:16:50,320
ended up going to Vienna and I,

293
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:54,040
I said to the head of the program,
you know, I'm, I worked a little,

294
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:56,870
I worked this one summer in a restaurant.
I'm interested in food.

295
00:16:56,871 --> 00:16:59,240
Like maybe there's a pastry shop
or something. I can go hang in,

296
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,270
hang out at once a once a week
or something. Totally casual.

297
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:06,260
So I landed in Vienna and she said,

298
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:11,290
so my husband's uncle's friend from
college son rides bicycles with the sous

299
00:17:12,351 --> 00:17:17,300
chef of the best restaurant in Vienna.
That's literally what it was. And,

300
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:22,140
uh, and she's like, you know,
he, he can meet you tomorrow, um,

301
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:26,210
if you're interested. It's like, all
right. So I meet this dude crazy guy.

302
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,600
Uh, and he, he comes up to me and says,

303
00:17:29,601 --> 00:17:34,190
are you the Yankee who wants to
cook on the street? And I said,

304
00:17:34,191 --> 00:17:38,480
I am. And I said, all right, well, we'll
come, come to the restaurant tomorrow.

305
00:17:38,481 --> 00:17:43,430
And so I did. And, um, it was a Michelin
Star, like best restaurant in Vienna.

306
00:17:43,431 --> 00:17:46,250
It was incredible.
I knew nothing about food,

307
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,800
and they ended up taking
me in and training me.

308
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:53,910
I'm sort of old school European
style, like, Kick Your Butt,

309
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:59,310
uh, you know, until you can't take any
more and you figure it out. And, uh,

310
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,010
lots of stories from that,
from that, from that place.

311
00:18:02,011 --> 00:18:05,130
But that's sort of how I
really was propelled into it.

312
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:09,250
Uh, so, uh, a few things I
just want to explain to people,

313
00:18:09,251 --> 00:18:13,000
maybe not in the industry.
So shoes a sous chef is,

314
00:18:13,001 --> 00:18:14,590
I guess that means under chef,
right?

315
00:18:14,591 --> 00:18:16,390
That's kind of the second
in command in the kitchen.

316
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:21,220
Is that a fair way to put it? Just like
Suvi is under, under pressure I guess. Uh,

317
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:26,180
and the, so there are a lot of stories.
I know we, we talked about one, uh,

318
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,570
over dinner the other
night and I can't skip it.

319
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:33,630
So could you tell people about your
sort of baptism by fire in that kitchen?

320
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:39,480
Um, so many stories. Uh, I
think the one, yeah, the,

321
00:18:39,481 --> 00:18:43,620
the, the, the, the, the fever
dream. A fever dream had. So, uh,

322
00:18:43,621 --> 00:18:46,080
so it was December and uh,

323
00:18:46,081 --> 00:18:50,040
and that's the busiest time of the
year by far for this restaurant.

324
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:54,030
And the, um, the guy who did all the fish,

325
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,870
meats and sauces,
what had to have surgery.

326
00:18:57,871 --> 00:19:02,871
And so the executive chef had to take
over for him and now he was like 40,

327
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:06,600
and was a super talented guy, but
was like not cooking anymore. Like,

328
00:19:06,601 --> 00:19:09,540
he wasn't running things and being
out with the guests and you know,

329
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:10,374
doing his thing.

330
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:14,640
So he was really unhappy about having to
cook the line during the most busy time

331
00:19:14,641 --> 00:19:18,480
of the year. So he, he, like he walked
in when, when we got news and it's like,

332
00:19:18,481 --> 00:19:19,530
all right, Yankee, you're with me.

333
00:19:19,531 --> 00:19:23,940
And so he had this huge incentive to
teach me how to prep everything as fast as

334
00:19:23,941 --> 00:19:25,890
possible because he didn't
want to have to do it.

335
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:29,850
So he taught me how to make
all the sauces, prep all
the meats, cook everything.

336
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:33,600
And so then we would work
the service together. Uh,

337
00:19:33,601 --> 00:19:36,480
but in the middle of the month,
on a Friday,

338
00:19:36,481 --> 00:19:40,770
the chef came down with like 104
fever and was completely laid out.

339
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:45,840
And it just so happened that my best
friend who was a road scholar, uh,

340
00:19:45,841 --> 00:19:50,380
at the time was coming to
visit me from England. And, um,

341
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,800
so, you know, we're
supposed to go, hang on,

342
00:19:52,801 --> 00:19:55,020
I was supposed to have the weekend
off and we were just going to hang.

343
00:19:55,021 --> 00:19:59,070
And so he shows up and I'm like,
hey man, you're coming with me.

344
00:19:59,071 --> 00:20:02,660
I'm putting you in a chef coat,
like we can't leave. And uh,

345
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:06,270
they had the breakfast cook,
this Guy Wolfgang who was at awesome dude,

346
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,290
but you know,
he was like,

347
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:10,020
he was like doing platters of
fruit and it needs a good cook,

348
00:20:10,021 --> 00:20:12,480
but he didn't like Cook Dinner Service.
He never had.

349
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:16,260
So it was the three of us trying to
figure out this dinner service and it was

350
00:20:16,261 --> 00:20:21,150
pretty funny. But the, at the end
of the night, the sous chef said,

351
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,930
alright, Wolfgang, you've got to
take the day off. Um, it's the,

352
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:26,130
it's the two Yankees on
the stove tomorrow night.

353
00:20:26,131 --> 00:20:29,200
And like the kitchen went silent.
Like all the cooks were like, whoa.

354
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:33,780
Like they couldn't believe it.
And so we figured out the system.

355
00:20:33,781 --> 00:20:38,700
My friends, a smart guy, so he, we studied
the words in German of the different,

356
00:20:38,701 --> 00:20:41,130
like fish and meats
and whatever we needed.

357
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,850
So the next night we had like
a crate and we were packed.

358
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:48,010
And so the,
the sous would call it the order.

359
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,790
My friend would take out the fish or
the meat and then, and I would cook it.

360
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,240
And you,
and you know,

361
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:58,090
as I'm cooking on the other side of me
also cooking and facing me was the guy

362
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:02,440
who did all the vegetables inside dishes
that would go with my meat or fish and

363
00:21:02,441 --> 00:21:06,070
I'd look up and he would just be standing
there kind of with his mouth open,

364
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,910
completely in awe of what was
going on because you know,

365
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:12,340
that station that we were working was
like what people would work their whole

366
00:21:12,341 --> 00:21:15,880
career for us and incredibly prestigious,
well-paid position.

367
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:19,510
And here are these two Americans
who knew nothing about cooking,

368
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:23,590
working in a Michelin Star restaurant
on the hardest station in the kitchen.

369
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,500
It was hysterical. Uh,
and we made it like we,

370
00:21:27,501 --> 00:21:29,800
we basically got through
without any catastrophe.

371
00:21:29,801 --> 00:21:32,740
And I'll never forget when the last
ticket went out. The sous chef,

372
00:21:32,741 --> 00:21:36,040
his name was Alice, he turns
around, he said, Yankees, we won.

373
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:41,260
And then like just in German shouted
for bottles of champagne and bottles of

374
00:21:41,261 --> 00:21:45,370
beer. And, uh, and we had a good old
party that night. It was, it was, uh,

375
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:46,390
it was a ton of fun.

376
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:47,663
And,
uh,

377
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:52,700
I remember hearing this story and just
having my jaw dropped open because I've

378
00:21:54,201 --> 00:21:57,950
had of course very limited
exposure to food and restaurants.

379
00:21:57,951 --> 00:22:02,890
But during the writing of the flower chef,
when we first met men have been in DC.

380
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,930
Yeah, I remember going into
a handful of restaurants,

381
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:09,020
obviously different restaurants
that very different environments,

382
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:13,790
but when you're, when you look at a
line, not at a Michelin Star Restaurant,

383
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:14,430
but,
uh,

384
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:19,220
just at any restaurant during a busy
period and like 40 menus open at the same

385
00:22:19,221 --> 00:22:21,230
time, it is complete chaos. I mean,

386
00:22:21,231 --> 00:22:23,960
you have to be doctor octopus
to work one of the hotlines.

387
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:28,850
So it's like you guys were kind of yanked
out of the audience by the conductor

388
00:22:28,851 --> 00:22:33,330
of the orchestra and asked to do
Violin Solos. Uh, it's, it's, uh,

389
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:35,060
I can't believe you guys
made it through that.

390
00:22:35,061 --> 00:22:40,061
What's w what was your internal
self talk like when you got,

391
00:22:40,911 --> 00:22:44,600
when you got the news and like when you
got the news or when you walked in for

392
00:22:44,601 --> 00:22:48,620
that, that evening. I mean, how
did you prep yourself to that?

393
00:22:48,621 --> 00:22:50,060
Because unlike baseball,
right,

394
00:22:50,061 --> 00:22:55,061
like if you're putting out every three
out of 10 dishes is working in the

395
00:22:55,341 --> 00:22:58,330
restaurant, you get punched
in the face. So yeah.

396
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,650
What was your self talk to?

397
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:03,340
It's a great,
it's a,

398
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,490
I mean I think that the key in a
restaurant and the key in any kind of high

399
00:23:06,491 --> 00:23:10,820
pressure situation like I
think 75% of success is,

400
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:15,880
is staying calm and not losing
your nerve. And um, you know,

401
00:23:15,881 --> 00:23:19,630
the rest you figure out, but once you
lose your, once you lose your, your,

402
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:22,450
your calm,
everything else starts falling apart fast.

403
00:23:22,451 --> 00:23:23,540
And in a restaurant situation,

404
00:23:23,541 --> 00:23:27,250
as the tick tickets start piling up and
like everybody else's is waiting on you.

405
00:23:27,251 --> 00:23:29,560
So,
and particularly in this like the time,

406
00:23:29,561 --> 00:23:32,840
it would have to be perfect cause
you go up on six dishes and the, the,

407
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:35,920
the guy who's doing all the side stuff
has like cooked all this and he's got to

408
00:23:35,921 --> 00:23:39,550
get to the next round. So your timing has
to be right on. And if you're too slow,

409
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,650
all of his stuff gets yes.
You know,

410
00:23:41,651 --> 00:23:43,780
it gets overcooked and he's
got to cook it again. Right.

411
00:23:43,781 --> 00:23:46,430
So you can really throw off then.

412
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,880
So I think the key thing was
like mentally preparing myself.

413
00:23:49,881 --> 00:23:53,030
Like when something goes wrong you
just stay calm and stay the course.

414
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,550
And I think the other thing, one of the
first thing the sous chefs taught me,

415
00:23:55,551 --> 00:24:00,020
like he gave me some really fundamental
rules which have lasted me kind of

416
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:01,040
throughout everything I do.

417
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:04,850
One is the first is never serve
anything you wouldn't want to eat,

418
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,840
like never served crap. It's like
rule number one, rule number two,

419
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:10,220
which is just true.
Just so you know,

420
00:24:10,221 --> 00:24:11,900
you can have a high standard
on everything you do.

421
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:16,790
Rule number two was when things get
really busy instead of just like,

422
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,180
like plowing ahead and just trying to
work as fast as you can and just go

423
00:24:20,181 --> 00:24:20,810
through all the tickets.

424
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:24,110
He always would tell me step
back and come up with a plan.

425
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:28,640
So look at which dishes you
have and figure out what's
the most efficient way to

426
00:24:28,641 --> 00:24:32,450
cook them. So if you have five of one
thing, don't just cook them one at a time.

427
00:24:32,451 --> 00:24:33,620
Like get them out,

428
00:24:33,621 --> 00:24:38,621
prep them together and do them together
so that those kind of like fundamental

429
00:24:39,111 --> 00:24:42,650
rules, I tried to hold really close and
you just come up with a good system.

430
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:47,570
I think every great restaurant has an
incredibly strong system that when the,

431
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:51,920
the pressure gets heated, heated up
and everything's moving super fast,

432
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:55,760
you rely on that system to move you
through. And I think that was key.

433
00:24:55,761 --> 00:24:59,210
We came up with a good system and,
and out it went. So I, I've no,

434
00:24:59,211 --> 00:25:01,400
you're not focusing on too
many things at any one time.

435
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:04,880
Focus on cooking the things that
my friend was giving me and uh,

436
00:25:04,881 --> 00:25:05,840
and it worked really well.

437
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:07,400
It was a,

438
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:12,250
it was so fascinating for me to visit
different kitchens and look at the layouts

439
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,320
and, and uh, and the,

440
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:18,400
the methods because they were really
sort of the internal workings of the

441
00:25:18,401 --> 00:25:21,430
executive chef thrown out into this,

442
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,310
the architecture of the room
and the process and all that.

443
00:25:24,311 --> 00:25:28,420
And just being so surprised at,
for instance, a Alinea in Chicago.

444
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:32,500
And how quiet it is. There's no
yelling, there's no screaming.

445
00:25:32,501 --> 00:25:37,300
It's more like an operating
table. Uh, what is the most,

446
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:41,780
uh,
unusual restaurant that's a,

447
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:46,390
that puts out very good food that you've
come across in terms of just how it

448
00:25:46,391 --> 00:25:47,224
works?

449
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:51,760
Hmm. Well, the craziest
kitchen I have ever seen.

450
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,270
So I worked at a Vac,
which is one of Chicago,

451
00:25:54,271 --> 00:25:57,140
one of America's great
restaurants and you know,

452
00:25:57,150 --> 00:26:01,650
it was really a wine bar that ended up
putting up such good food that it's won

453
00:26:01,651 --> 00:26:05,160
James Beard awards and all kinds of other
accolades just because the food ended

454
00:26:05,161 --> 00:26:07,500
up just kicking butt,
but it was not set up that at all.

455
00:26:07,501 --> 00:26:10,170
So it was a teeny line if three people,

456
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:14,820
one big wood burning and gas burning
like kind of oven and a little stove and

457
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,140
what people do out of that.

458
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:18,780
It's just what we were doing out
of that with Tsung was incredible.

459
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:22,140
But the kitchen that's like blows me
away the most is the kitchen here in

460
00:26:22,141 --> 00:26:26,670
Brooklyn actually, uh, at
Frankie's four 57. It's so tiny.

461
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:32,060
It's literally like two guys on to a
induction burners in a space that's like,

462
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:35,783
I don't know,

463
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:40,940
like five feet by 10 feet and they cook
for this huge restaurant at quality.

464
00:26:42,421 --> 00:26:46,290
It's like one of my restaurants in
America. What was the name again?

465
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,380
Frankie's four 57.
It's unbelievably good.

466
00:26:49,381 --> 00:26:52,830
And it's like you look at these two guys
back there with an n d two induction

467
00:26:52,831 --> 00:26:56,730
burners and he, I just don't know.
I just don't know how they do it.

468
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:00,870
And it's, the menu is huge. I mean
it's, it's still, and it's delicious.

469
00:27:00,871 --> 00:27:04,740
So what people can do out
of very small spaces is,

470
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:09,750
um, is pretty incredible. So
the, for, for people who you,

471
00:27:09,751 --> 00:27:13,470
who don't know what an induction burner
is and then didn't correct me if Ryan

472
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:18,480
induction burner is basically a stove
top that you plug in and you can put on a

473
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:20,440
countertop,

474
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,560
maybe it's the size of like a large dinner
plate and it depends on what kind you

475
00:27:23,561 --> 00:27:27,460
get. But he uses, as I understand
it, magnets to yes. Metal.

476
00:27:27,461 --> 00:27:29,170
So you could actually take the pot off,

477
00:27:29,171 --> 00:27:31,560
put your hand right on the
burner and not burn your hand.

478
00:27:31,561 --> 00:27:35,770
You got to make sure you don't have
rings on. But, um, that actually,

479
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:40,750
uh, raises, so this, this is this
question of kind of elegance, right?

480
00:27:40,751 --> 00:27:43,810
Because, uh, one of the questions I was
going to ask you later is what, you know,

481
00:27:43,811 --> 00:27:47,260
what's the most interesting meal you
could make an a dorm room, right?

482
00:27:47,261 --> 00:27:50,860
And you could, you could,
I mean, induction burners
in a five by 10 foot space.

483
00:27:50,861 --> 00:27:53,520
I mean, that's basically a dorm
room that these guys are cooking in.

484
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:55,430
It sounds like if,
um,

485
00:27:55,480 --> 00:28:00,480
if you had to limit your herbs or spices
to three choices for the rest of your

486
00:28:03,071 --> 00:28:06,190
life, what would your three,
what would your three choices be?

487
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,110
Herbs or spices. Oh my God, what a
horrible, horrible question for me.

488
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,220
Only three.

489
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:15,560
Yeah. Or, or let you know what, I'll
give you a little bit of wiggle room.

490
00:28:15,561 --> 00:28:17,600
A handful,
a handful.

491
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:23,040
I mean, I'd have to have chilies
of some kinds. Any kinds. Uh,

492
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:26,670
there's lots of kinds, but you know,
some, some chilies. I would have to have,

493
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:32,130
um, any herbs or spices. Uh,

494
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:36,960
I'm, uh, I'd probably have
to take Faisal and terragon.

495
00:28:36,961 --> 00:28:40,970
I'm a huge terragon okay. Guy. Um,

496
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:46,660
spices. I mean, oh my God,
how do I pick just one?

497
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,930
Uh, Oh God. I Dunno. Like
Kumon is a big, is a,

498
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:56,950
is a really versatile big spice.
Um, I love pink peppercorns,

499
00:28:56,951 --> 00:29:00,790
although I don't know if
that make the cut. Um, yeah,

500
00:29:00,791 --> 00:29:02,190
that's a really hard question.

501
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:04,740
Oh, I know. That's why
I, that's why this is,

502
00:29:04,741 --> 00:29:08,310
this is to get the tea to make the
shopping list for myself and I've terragon

503
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:13,280
terragon kind of revolutionized
eggs for me. Terragon and, and um,

504
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,600
white truffle sea salts of all things.
So,

505
00:29:15,601 --> 00:29:18,570
which was recommended by a friend of mine.
How do you use Terry Dawn?

506
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:23,300
Oh Man. You can just check
on it. Anything. I love it
in straight and salads. Um,

507
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:26,830
you could chop it up with like
some parsley and some days on,

508
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:30,670
you can put that on fish on.
I use terragon on stake.

509
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:34,610
Terragon like little terragon and maybe
even a little butter on a steak is

510
00:29:34,611 --> 00:29:38,850
delicious. Um, uh, anything seafood.

511
00:29:38,851 --> 00:29:41,440
I find tarragon goes also
really well with, so you can do,

512
00:29:41,441 --> 00:29:44,490
if you're doing a pasta like lemon,
you know,

513
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:48,370
a lemon terragon something seafood pasta,
a fill in the blank on the seafood,

514
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:53,070
you pretty much can't go
wrong. Um, so it's, it's, it's
one of those interests. You,

515
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:57,180
you know, you gotta be careful because
you can use it's strong. So, um,

516
00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:00,910
you can overuse it pretty quickly,
but if you use it gently it, um,

517
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,290
it's a beautiful flavor.

518
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:07,830
You mentioned steak. What is your
favorite cut of steak and Y ou?

519
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:10,880
I guess favorite. I guess I'd
have to be a rabbi, a guy,

520
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:15,920
but I eat a lot of skirt steak, a lot
of hanger steak. Um, I love brazing.

521
00:30:15,921 --> 00:30:20,300
So you know, lots of different, you
know, the bridge and cuts, ribs and such.

522
00:30:20,301 --> 00:30:23,210
But if I'm going to have, like,
if I wouldn't have my last steak,

523
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,073
it would be a rabbi.

524
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:29,350
When you're cooking, remind for yourself
just, just for Sam. Nobody is. How do you,

525
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,243
how do you cook it?

526
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:35,360
A grill. I, you know,
if I'm doing for myself,

527
00:30:35,361 --> 00:30:36,380
but really if I'm doing it for anybody,

528
00:30:36,381 --> 00:30:39,710
I just throw it on the
grill really simple. Um,

529
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:44,770
and like medium rare to
rare and pretty olive oil,

530
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:50,240
salt and to sit sometimes pepper,
sometimes not. I'm not a big pepper guy,

531
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:54,350
so I don't put that black pepper on much.
I'm pretty much anything really. Um,

532
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:59,210
but I'll stake is the kind of the one
thing that I'd be open to that and yeah,

533
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,550
in a way you go nothing,
nothing fancy.

534
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:06,040
And you put the olive oil and
salt on beforehand or afterwards?

535
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:09,220
Beforehand. Yeah. And if I,
and if I'm going to do an herb,

536
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:12,490
like sometimes I'll put
terragon or some rosemary. Uh,

537
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:16,510
I always do that afterwards because I
find that when you put it on before just

538
00:31:16,511 --> 00:31:19,720
burned and you lose the flavor.
But if you, you hit it afterwards,

539
00:31:19,721 --> 00:31:22,390
particularly if you're going to sear it
on the grill and then finish in the oven

540
00:31:22,391 --> 00:31:26,610
for a few minutes, which is often the way
to do it. If you have a thick cut, um,

541
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:28,560
you put that on. So it gets to, you know,

542
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:31,840
it cooks a little bit to round out
the flavor, but it doesn't, uh,

543
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:32,920
it doesn't kill the flavor.

544
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,490
Yeah. I always, um,

545
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:39,280
finish sort of sear and then finish it
the oven at a low temperature and uh,

546
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:42,710
just let the butter and whatever herbs
I'm going to use kind of soak in from the

547
00:31:42,711 --> 00:31:46,670
top down. Uh, the, so the
pet, the pepper point,

548
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,100
you mentioned not much
of a black pepper guy,

549
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:51,410
but you also mentioned the
pink peppercorn. So would,

550
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,600
what would you use pink
peppercorns for them?

551
00:31:53,601 --> 00:31:55,430
Which I haven't ever used or I don't that,

552
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,290
yeah, you can. I mean,

553
00:31:57,291 --> 00:32:01,460
so you could use them on any meat they
like go great on like pork or if you

554
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:05,150
grind them up as a rub on pork or uh,

555
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:09,830
you could do on stake as well. Um,
you can, you can do a fun dressing,

556
00:32:09,831 --> 00:32:14,030
a salad dressing with them as part of it,
but it becomes part of a,

557
00:32:14,031 --> 00:32:18,980
a flavor. Whereas like for me,
black pepper, it's used like salt.

558
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:22,280
Right. And we use it on
everything, but salt doesn't,

559
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:26,930
it's all becomes part of the flavor. It,
it elevates the flavor. Worst pepper,

560
00:32:26,931 --> 00:32:29,990
like layers on top of the flavor.
And it's,

561
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:35,060
it always just kind of blanket things
for me. And I dunno, I just, I don't,

562
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:38,180
I'm just not a fan, uh, uh,

563
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:42,260
of that sort ubiquitous pepper
flavor on everything. Um,

564
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:46,360
so on the flip side, if a,
aside from terragon, if someone,

565
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:49,840
if one of your very close
friends were to say, you know,

566
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:52,720
I love Sam but he really
overuses this ingredient,

567
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:57,250
what would that ingredient or
condiments or herb or spice spicy.

568
00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:02,120
Mm. I Dunno, probably garlic,

569
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:05,930
but we all are guilty of using garlic
too much cause it's just so damn good.

570
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,600
It just makes everything better.

571
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:13,850
I, I literally have minced garlic in my
tea right now. I'm not getting, so yeah,

572
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:18,830
I'm guilty of the same sin. Uh, God,

573
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:23,660
uh,
how did you first meet the Obamas?

574
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:26,690
Um, so, uh, yeah,

575
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:30,190
so we're both from Hyde Park and
high park is on south side Chicago,

576
00:33:30,191 --> 00:33:35,170
like where the universe Chicago
is and, and um, you know,
while he was a professor,

577
00:33:35,171 --> 00:33:39,940
actually I known him just
from the neighborhood, uh,
and the first now first lady,

578
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:43,330
um, and when I was in
high school and then, uh,

579
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:46,960
but then lost touch with them for many
years and got reconnected with them when

580
00:33:46,961 --> 00:33:50,200
I came back from my,
uh, my time in Vienna.

581
00:33:50,201 --> 00:33:54,850
And then subsequent travels around the
world of sort of traveled for about four

582
00:33:54,851 --> 00:33:59,170
or five years, you know, through
Vienna and then be passed. Um,

583
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,440
so I got reconnected with them sort
of right as the campaign was, was, uh,

584
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,360
was getting going.

585
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:08,340
And was that through evac or how
did you guys end depth reconnecting?

586
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:13,380
Um, so, uh, we reconnected because why
I be after I've, when I was in Vienna,

587
00:34:13,381 --> 00:34:14,490
I was actually there illegally.

588
00:34:14,491 --> 00:34:18,780
I had no worker's permit or anything
and ended up sort of getting run out of

589
00:34:18,781 --> 00:34:22,680
town. Uh, yeah, so that's the story.

590
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:27,480
That's a story for another day.
Uh, and, um, so then I spent about,

591
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:32,160
um, for, for you four more years
passed that cooking and traveling.

592
00:34:32,161 --> 00:34:35,820
And I ended up getting connected to a
family that had a place in New Zealand.

593
00:34:35,821 --> 00:34:39,870
And so I cooked a couple of seasons
down in New Zealand and they were from

594
00:34:39,871 --> 00:34:44,100
Chicago. So I, the, after the second
season I came back with them to,

595
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:48,140
um, to Chicago to work part time. And the,

596
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:51,180
the father of that family knew,
uh,

597
00:34:51,181 --> 00:34:55,310
the first lady and happened
to run into her, um, on a,

598
00:34:55,320 --> 00:35:00,270
on a plane and they got to talking
and, you know, and he was telling him,

599
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:05,250
telling the, the first study about, uh,
you know, me cooking for them. And, and,

600
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:08,880
and she's like, Oh, Sam, I
haven't seen him in years.
And so we got reconnected and,

601
00:35:08,881 --> 00:35:13,590
um, you know, back then there was no
staff. It was basically just them,

602
00:35:13,591 --> 00:35:16,950
grandma a little, they had a little
bit of help, but, but not much.

603
00:35:16,951 --> 00:35:21,750
So I started helping out the first lady
as she had to get on the campaign trail

604
00:35:21,751 --> 00:35:23,820
more and more when the
kids were still very young.

605
00:35:23,821 --> 00:35:27,420
And so started helping her out with, uh,
with cooking some better food for them.

606
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:32,770
What's meals?
What were some favorite meals during that?

607
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:34,820
That, uh, intense campaigning period.

608
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:39,630
Oh, you know, that's all top secrets.
Just scared. Disclose. No, just kidding.

609
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:46,440
You know, look at the end during that time
and all the way through. I mean, they,

610
00:35:46,441 --> 00:35:46,800
there's,

611
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,600
there's never been any
interest in fancy food at all,

612
00:35:51,601 --> 00:35:55,140
really simple food that everybody's
going to like, you know,

613
00:35:55,141 --> 00:35:59,390
lots of chicken or lean proteins, lots
of fish. We always do whole grains.

614
00:35:59,391 --> 00:36:03,500
So if we're doing rice, there's always
brown rice and always, you know, you know,

615
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:08,320
good, good serving of vegetables.
Um, and just, you know, um,

616
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,360
nothing. It's always, I think
the thing that people, um,

617
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,920
you know, think about when
they think of private chef,
do you think, oh, fancy food,

618
00:36:16,921 --> 00:36:18,240
but really you're in your home,
right?

619
00:36:18,241 --> 00:36:20,640
So people don't want to feel
like they're in a restaurant.

620
00:36:20,641 --> 00:36:24,300
And that's same was true in the
White House. And I think, um,

621
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:28,080
so we always kept at it really,
really simple. Um, and never,

622
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:31,980
never did anything. I mean,
we ate like everybody else
eats nothing, nothing crazy.

623
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:36,180
We'd love a good Burger, you
know? Uh, so things like that.

624
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:39,810
What if,
if hypothetically you had,

625
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:44,370
let's say five years from now you decide,
you know what, just for the hell of it,

626
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:48,750
I'm going to have a couple
of restaurants in Chicago.

627
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:52,230
And uh,
you go back at some point,

628
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,920
you're the owner and you decided to kind
of hang out at one of the restaurants

629
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:57,450
and Lo and lo and behold,

630
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:01,410
the Obama's come in for
dinner and they say, Sam,

631
00:37:01,411 --> 00:37:03,780
make us whatever you think
will bring back the memories.

632
00:37:03,781 --> 00:37:04,614
What would you make them?

633
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:09,060
How would I'm pretty right to marry?
Or would that make them a,

634
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:10,530
that's a great question.
I guess it depends.

635
00:37:10,531 --> 00:37:13,110
The first thing I'd say is it depends on
what the season is because I think one

636
00:37:13,111 --> 00:37:18,000
of the keys to great food is
cooking with the season, summertime,

637
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:21,700
summertime. So summertime, I'd
probably start with a like a,

638
00:37:21,701 --> 00:37:24,370
a really nice tomato salad because I'm,

639
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:26,940
one of the best things about being in
the White House has been the first lady's

640
00:37:26,941 --> 00:37:30,930
garden. And we got to pick, you know,
awesome produce right out of the garden,

641
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:35,450
right before dinner. So I'd probably
start with an awesome tomato salad. Um,

642
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:40,170
maybe do some barbecue chicken,
um,

643
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:44,380
uh, with Muslim good spice. I Dunno, uh,

644
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,570
maybe some potatoes and a,
just a bunch of vegetables.

645
00:37:48,571 --> 00:37:52,660
So we would pick like P and
g Zucchini and Bazell Oh,

646
00:37:52,661 --> 00:37:56,460
maybe a little egg plan or some peppers.
I don't know.

647
00:37:56,470 --> 00:38:00,720
It just depends what's going on. We've
grown some great corn, so maybe do some,

648
00:38:00,721 --> 00:38:04,560
some really good corn with
that. Um, some like that.

649
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:07,940
What's, um, what would the
tomato salad look like?

650
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:12,600
I love to me, if you've got
great tomatoes, you don't
want to do much John. I mean,

651
00:38:12,601 --> 00:38:14,000
I think,
um,

652
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,410
if you don't have great tomatoes then
you've got to work with them some,

653
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:20,320
but you probably should just do
it different salad. Then I, uh,

654
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:24,570
I like it with a little onion. And on
this one, like typically have a red onion,

655
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:29,040
really thinly sliced. One of my big
things I hate thickly sliced red onion.

656
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:32,550
It's like as thin as you can
slice it thinner, the better. Uh,

657
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:37,150
but I'll actually in the tomato saddle
widening finally too is, is good. Um,

658
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:41,980
with some nice, uh,
olive oil and you know,

659
00:38:41,981 --> 00:38:44,500
like a white Balsamic is
really nice on tomato salad.

660
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:49,390
It's got a touch of sweetness, um, in
any, any number of herbs like, you know,

661
00:38:49,391 --> 00:38:53,920
you could do part holy parsley and some
Bazell maybe throw in some like green

662
00:38:53,921 --> 00:38:56,800
beans or wax beans in there
that are blanched. So I'm like,

663
00:38:56,801 --> 00:38:59,620
that sounds pretty good to me.
That sounds great.

664
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:05,280
What other pet peeves do you have
aside from overuse of pepper?

665
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:09,490
Thickly sliced onions. I love pet peeves.
I've got a million of them myself.

666
00:39:09,491 --> 00:39:13,630
So what other things make you
crazy when it comes to food? Uh,

667
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:19,520
I think the thing that makes me the most
crazy in food is just when people try

668
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:22,620
too hard and they try to be
something that they're not. Like,

669
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,090
there's nothing more than I love them.

670
00:39:24,091 --> 00:39:28,950
And I got a perfect fried wing
or like an awesome burger.

671
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,840
But I hate when there's like food that's
looks all fancy but tastes like crap.

672
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:36,150
Like, it's like just, just, you know,

673
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:40,860
if you can do food that's beautiful
and super welcome post and, and like,

674
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:44,370
I appreciate that too.
It's not that I don't like that,

675
00:39:44,371 --> 00:39:48,420
but if you're just on foam everywhere
and doing all of some weird concoctions

676
00:39:48,421 --> 00:39:52,290
because that's sort of trendy.
Like I hate the trends in food ag grill,

677
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:56,760
just well executed food and you can tell
it has a lot of love in it and a lot of

678
00:39:56,761 --> 00:40:01,620
authenticity in it. And I think that
that for me is his most important. Um,

679
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:05,590
so I, I did generally, that's the
thing that like the determined

680
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:09,600
my experience, uh, and eating and
eating somebody's food. That was,

681
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:13,200
that was something that really surprised
me when I got to know quite a few

682
00:40:13,201 --> 00:40:17,730
shifts in writing. The four chef was
that, uh, when they came to visit,

683
00:40:17,731 --> 00:40:21,960
say my house for dinner or someone else
says the last thing they wanted to have

684
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:25,080
was a five course meal.
Yeah.

685
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:29,760
Like the last thing they wanted to have
with some type of foam sprayed onto

686
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:32,670
their plate with like tweezer cuisine
on top of it. They're just like, no,

687
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:33,490
just give me like a,

688
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:38,490
a really fatty burger or something
really simple that I can enjoy consuming.

689
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:43,570
Uh, the, uh, what, what made the,

690
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:46,350
the White House Garden unique?
Cause I know that,

691
00:40:46,351 --> 00:40:51,240
that a lot of thought went into that
and I've become, I've never gardened,

692
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:55,560
uh, but I'd become very fascinated by
it because I, when I went to, uh, this,

693
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:59,910
this village called Ogi me in
Okinawa at one point, it has the,

694
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,000
the longest median lifespan in the world
and I just noticed that nearly everyone

695
00:41:05,311 --> 00:41:07,720
gardened in some capacity.
Um,

696
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:10,500
so what made the White
House Garden unique?

697
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:14,790
Uh, well there's a lot unique
about that garden. Um, you know,

698
00:41:14,791 --> 00:41:19,350
one is the first garden since Eleanor
Roosevelt Victory Garden during World War

699
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:22,170
II, which was a really
powerful symbolic garden,

700
00:41:22,171 --> 00:41:26,340
but it was actually quite small and
really didn't produce food to eat. Um,

701
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,440
so the White House Garden,

702
00:41:28,441 --> 00:41:32,160
the first age garden is really the
first garden since the late 1890s,

703
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:37,910
and that, that actually produced food.
Um, and, you know, it was designed,

704
00:41:37,911 --> 00:41:42,230
it's whole purpose was to really
shine a light on, on food,

705
00:41:42,231 --> 00:41:46,100
where it comes from, how it's grown,
how hard it is to grow good food,

706
00:41:46,101 --> 00:41:51,101
and really lift up farmers all over
America that are producing the,

707
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:56,840
the nourishment that we need to survive
and, um, and, and make it educational.

708
00:41:56,930 --> 00:42:00,080
And I, and I think that's
really it. You know,

709
00:42:00,081 --> 00:42:04,740
so it was a working last card and
that we ate from every day. Um,

710
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:09,770
but also we had kids come down for,
towards tours on a weekly basis.

711
00:42:09,771 --> 00:42:12,920
The kids would come and plant with the
first lady and then harvest and cook with

712
00:42:12,921 --> 00:42:15,780
her a couple of times a year.
We had a compost.

713
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:19,460
It's a really talk about the importance
of giving back to the soil building soil

714
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:23,340
fertility, which is a huge
issue across the country. Um,

715
00:42:23,341 --> 00:42:28,320
and we also had the first ever beehive on
the White House grounds, um, which, uh,

716
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,250
which is, which is just awesome.
And we got tons of honey,

717
00:42:31,251 --> 00:42:35,030
but also could talk to the kids about
pollinators and why they're so important.

718
00:42:35,031 --> 00:42:37,420
And we have a huge,
huge problem with Paul,

719
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:39,680
a climate colony collapse
disorder and we're,

720
00:42:39,681 --> 00:42:43,670
we're losing bees and other pollinators
that, you know, really alarming rates,

721
00:42:43,671 --> 00:42:47,380
which have massive implications
for our economy and our ability to,

722
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:50,140
to produce food. So,
you know, I think, um,

723
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:54,260
when you look at the whole picture and
what it's accomplished since that garden

724
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:58,910
planted gardening across the country
is skyrocket, it's up over 30%.

725
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:03,800
Um, and uh, so it's been a really
exciting and, and it was just,

726
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:04,693
it was a ton of fun.

727
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:07,280
You mentioned,

728
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,500
you mentioned a couple of things
that I think are really important.

729
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:15,070
The magnitude of the impact of B is
something I never really understood and I

730
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:18,860
still need to understand more, but, uh,

731
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:21,980
people talking about the butterfly
effect and the like, you know,

732
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,590
the be affect sort of the ripple,

733
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:28,880
the cascade of different sort of ecosystem
changes that bees are involved with

734
00:43:28,881 --> 00:43:30,320
is really astonishing.

735
00:43:30,321 --> 00:43:34,190
The second thing I would encourage people
to look into is what you mentioned,

736
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:37,790
which is the soil depletion.
And I remember at one point,

737
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:43,400
maybe one of the listeners can, can
find this, but seeing data that, uh,

738
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:48,640
I believe it was from China that looked
at the incidence and frequency of a

739
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,940
cancer diagnosis in
different regions in China.

740
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:57,970
And you could pretty much predict how
much cancer there would be based on a top

741
00:43:58,881 --> 00:44:03,650
soil depletion in different
regions because they would
end up with trace mineral

742
00:44:03,651 --> 00:44:07,260
deficiencies like selenium
and so on. Um, and uh,

743
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,680
I remember reading
about this at one point,

744
00:44:09,681 --> 00:44:13,400
if something like in certain areas
because of a mono crops, you know,

745
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:18,170
like the wheat and soy and so on. In the
u s the top soil has gone from whatever,

746
00:44:18,171 --> 00:44:19,880
10 feet to like 10 inches.

747
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:24,940
And what do you think needs to be done
or what can be done to help reverse that

748
00:44:25,581 --> 00:44:26,414
trend?

749
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:30,880
So there's a, there's a lot that needs
to be done. And I'd say it's, it's a,

750
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:34,440
a topic that doesn't get anywhere
near the attention that it deserves.

751
00:44:34,441 --> 00:44:37,860
But everything comes, everything
is based on the health of our soil.

752
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:42,890
It is the reason why we have such a
prosperous nation was that we had the best

753
00:44:42,991 --> 00:44:47,700
soil in the world and it helped us
produce a surplus of crops, which allowed,

754
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:48,870
um,
you know,

755
00:44:48,871 --> 00:44:52,800
big parts of our population to go on and
build and create and do other things.

756
00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:54,860
Um, and the, the,

757
00:44:54,861 --> 00:44:59,310
the dramatic loss across the nation on,
on our,

758
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:01,530
on our topsoil is something that is,

759
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,030
it couldn't be a more important issue
and it couldn't be a harder one to make,

760
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:09,600
get people excited about cause I got
dark. Like, what are you talking about?

761
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:13,860
You know, uh, there's lots of
things that need to be done. Um,

762
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,350
and I think they're
starting to see some change.

763
00:45:16,351 --> 00:45:18,330
I think people are starting
to note to wake up to this,

764
00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:23,010
we need to do much better job at rotating
our crops to rebuild fertility right

765
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:28,011
now where we're basically growing up just
a couple of crops and using synthetic

766
00:45:28,291 --> 00:45:32,640
fertilizers to sort of make up for
the lack of fertility in the soil.

767
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,530
That's a problem. We're
having all kinds of, uh, of,

768
00:45:35,590 --> 00:45:39,990
of problems from stemming from that
run off in our water. You know,

769
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:43,050
massive algae blooms and
the golf killing sees life,

770
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:44,910
there's lots of lots of
challenges going on there.

771
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:46,560
So I think we need to rotate crops.

772
00:45:46,561 --> 00:45:49,620
I think we need to change our practices
to really focus on rebuilding that

773
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:53,720
fertility, um, using
different, uh, sources of,

774
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:55,860
of fertilizer and natural fertilizers.

775
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:59,100
And you're starting to see people taking
back some of that land and rebuilding

776
00:45:59,101 --> 00:46:01,650
and hopefully that will continue
to grow. And people, I mean,

777
00:46:01,651 --> 00:46:06,390
I think are going to continually have
to ask, you know, work on, you know,

778
00:46:06,391 --> 00:46:10,650
sourcing food that's coming from farmers
that are, you know, uh, you know,

779
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:14,160
doing those kind of practices that are,
are more sustainable.

780
00:46:14,161 --> 00:46:16,620
I think the thing that people don't
realize that if we use those kinds of

781
00:46:16,621 --> 00:46:20,670
practices, that is the best, one of the
best tools we have to sequester carbon.

782
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:25,570
So agriculture is not only a challenge
to when it comes to sustainability and

783
00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:29,070
our environmental challenges with,
with greenhouse gas emissions, it's a,

784
00:46:29,071 --> 00:46:31,500
it's a significant producer of,
but it actually,

785
00:46:31,501 --> 00:46:35,370
unlike other aspects of the challenge,
it can actually be part of the solution.

786
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:37,200
And so there's a,
there's,

787
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:40,920
there's exciting opportunity there that
we don't see in too many other sectors

788
00:46:40,921 --> 00:46:41,754
that need to change.

789
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:42,720
Yeah.
I'm,

790
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:47,720
I'm excited about the potential for a
kind of soil replenishment because I feel

791
00:46:50,371 --> 00:46:55,140
like it could be effective in marketing
product. Does that make sense?

792
00:46:55,141 --> 00:46:55,974
Like there's a,

793
00:46:56,070 --> 00:47:00,270
there's a kind of economic self interest
that I think could be harnessed if

794
00:47:00,810 --> 00:47:05,280
somebody could create the proper
campaign. Um, what, uh, what do you see,

795
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:08,610
or what do you think the
future is, if any of, uh,

796
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:11,790
say organic subsidies for
people who really want to,

797
00:47:11,791 --> 00:47:16,500
or large companies that really want to
produce organic produce but view it as

798
00:47:16,501 --> 00:47:19,350
cost prohibitive or,
or something along those lines?

799
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:22,290
Yeah,
so this is obviously a very complicated,

800
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:26,940
a complicated question and I'm really
complicated politics. I think the place,

801
00:47:26,941 --> 00:47:29,260
and this again,
is hard to get people super excited about,

802
00:47:29,261 --> 00:47:34,240
but I think the place to really start is
in research. So over the last 50 years,

803
00:47:34,241 --> 00:47:37,020
we poured the vast
majority. I mean, you know,

804
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:39,280
hundreds and hundreds
of millions of dollars,

805
00:47:39,281 --> 00:47:43,960
billions of dollars into researching
just a couple of crops. Uh, and,

806
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:48,700
uh, fruits and vegetables, uh,
writ large have not gotten,

807
00:47:48,701 --> 00:47:53,580
mostly it's gone to corn and soy, some
weed, but mostly corn and soy. Um,

808
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:59,130
and that is a loud corn and soy to be
produced much more efficiently than it

809
00:48:00,611 --> 00:48:05,010
used to. And so a lot of the
price difference, we talk
about the relative cost of,

810
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:08,770
of,
of say sugar and other things versus uh,

811
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:10,870
a fruit or a vegetable.

812
00:48:10,871 --> 00:48:14,530
It is because we figured out how to
grow those crops much more efficiently.

813
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:18,880
And so if we invest that same kind of
research to try to figure out how to grow

814
00:48:18,881 --> 00:48:20,140
foods and vegetables more efficiently,

815
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:23,860
we're going to make up a lot of the
ground. Now part of the challenges that,

816
00:48:23,861 --> 00:48:27,310
you know, the people who are currently
growing say the fruits and vegetables,

817
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:29,620
no matter whether they're doing
it organic or not organic,

818
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:35,050
they liked the fact that they're the
only ones growing it so they not support

819
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:38,080
subsidies for other people to
grow more fruits and vegetables.

820
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:41,980
That's interesting. So there's really
tough politics because in Washington,

821
00:48:41,981 --> 00:48:44,560
if the people you're trying
to help are against you,

822
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:48,130
it's going to be very hard
to move anything through.

823
00:48:48,310 --> 00:48:52,120
It's hard to move anything through if
they're with you because there's always

824
00:48:52,121 --> 00:48:54,580
going to, people meet people on
the other side fighting very hard,

825
00:48:54,590 --> 00:48:56,920
investing a lot of money
and seeing that not happen.

826
00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:02,220
So in this particular one is the politics
are really hard to get Congress to,

827
00:49:02,541 --> 00:49:06,610
to the shift where we're putting some
of these substances now on the organic

828
00:49:06,611 --> 00:49:08,470
side,
which is a different set of questions.

829
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:12,640
I think the market's going to have to
continue to drive the change and you're

830
00:49:12,641 --> 00:49:15,490
seeing organic, um, uh, you know,

831
00:49:15,491 --> 00:49:18,080
continue to grow at a very rapid way.

832
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:22,600
Although it's a still a very
small part of the overall, uh,

833
00:49:22,690 --> 00:49:26,200
food economy.
But I think the more consumers demand it,

834
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:29,800
I think the more it's going to get grown
and it's going to become increasingly

835
00:49:29,801 --> 00:49:34,630
more affordable for farmers to, to produce
it when we get some more scale there.

836
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:39,980
Yeah, it's a, it's a such
a thorny, gnarly topic.

837
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:41,720
Uh, and, uh, I would,

838
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:46,730
I would suggest just as a side note for
folks who perhaps want to eat organic

839
00:49:46,731 --> 00:49:49,490
but have to pick and choose for
financial reasons or otherwise,

840
00:49:49,491 --> 00:49:53,060
there's a list called the dirty dozen
and I think it might be the clean 15,

841
00:49:53,061 --> 00:49:53,894
which is sort of the,

842
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:58,700
the 12 items produce items that are
best avoided that have the highest

843
00:49:58,701 --> 00:50:03,440
concentrations of pesticides. But I think
the research is really, as you noted,

844
00:50:03,470 --> 00:50:05,720
super important because if a,

845
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:09,860
it's one thing in the abstract to say
organic is better for reasons a, B,

846
00:50:09,861 --> 00:50:12,320
and C of and avoiding
synthetic pesticides.

847
00:50:12,321 --> 00:50:14,390
But if someone could actually look at say,
the,

848
00:50:14,690 --> 00:50:19,690
the endocrin impact of estrogenic
compounds that are found in a synthetic

849
00:50:20,361 --> 00:50:24,890
fertilizers so that therefore affect
fertility or whatever, then I think the,

850
00:50:25,490 --> 00:50:27,760
it could get more airtime.
Um,

851
00:50:28,090 --> 00:50:32,210
I will, I will, I will say just on one
thing, on this point though, you know,

852
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:34,910
I think people should try to
eat organic when they can,

853
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:37,820
but I think they need to eat fruits
and vegetables first and foremost.

854
00:50:37,850 --> 00:50:42,600
So I think part of the, the thing to
be concerned about is, wow, um, I,

855
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:46,880
I would much rather
people eat a conventional,

856
00:50:46,881 --> 00:50:47,790
any conventional food,

857
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:52,730
vegetable then like organic
chips or organic cupcakes.

858
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:57,680
Right, right. And I think, um,
you know, we're getting better,

859
00:50:57,681 --> 00:50:59,210
people are raising more awareness.

860
00:50:59,211 --> 00:51:02,230
Our agricultural practices are
getting better largely because this,

861
00:51:02,231 --> 00:51:03,440
I was getting more and more expensive.

862
00:51:03,441 --> 00:51:06,890
So farmers are learning how to be more
diligent about their applications.

863
00:51:07,070 --> 00:51:09,290
There's obviously a lot,
lot longer to go,

864
00:51:09,291 --> 00:51:12,860
but there's going to be some things that
we're going to need some insecticides

865
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:17,120
and pesticides and I think that's okay as
long as they're being used responsibly.

866
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:22,190
Um, but, uh, but I don't want people, I
think part of that we need to avoid is,

867
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:26,090
um, sort of fear based,
uh, if you eat this,

868
00:51:26,091 --> 00:51:29,150
it's going to kill you because there's
just not the evidence there. There,

869
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:32,020
there's,
there's reasons for serious concern and,

870
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:35,360
and continue engagement in pushing
on some of these topics. But,

871
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:37,700
but it shouldn't keep anybody from,
uh,

872
00:51:37,850 --> 00:51:41,240
from consuming that kind of a balanced
diet that, that we know is important.

873
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:43,240
Do you,
um,

874
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:48,320
so there was an article that came out
recently by Steve Case called the future

875
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:52,400
food is food. Uh, what
do you, what is your,

876
00:51:52,430 --> 00:51:55,940
what are your thoughts on meal
replacements like soylent?

877
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:58,760
And so I actually tweeted about,

878
00:51:59,810 --> 00:52:03,590
I tweeted about that article. I, I
couldn't agree with what's the more,

879
00:52:03,591 --> 00:52:07,970
I mean Steve Basically makes the
argument that sort of high tech,

880
00:52:08,570 --> 00:52:12,350
uh, artists like artificially
put together, uh,

881
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:16,490
drinks that you know, are based
on some science, you know,

882
00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:21,020
Kinda could replace food. Um,
and I think the vision for,

883
00:52:21,021 --> 00:52:24,200
for the folks that swelling is that
they can create a perfect meal.

884
00:52:24,410 --> 00:52:29,090
So instead of eating a bunch of junk,
you can just conveniently drink this. Um,

885
00:52:29,091 --> 00:52:32,210
so I, I, I don't, I
don't hate the sort of,

886
00:52:32,211 --> 00:52:36,350
the vision there in the sense that
they're trying to do something good,

887
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:41,630
but if the future is a
disgusting, tasteless, uh,

888
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:45,950
soulless beverage to sustain,
you know, just to keep us alive,

889
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:48,980
that's not a future. I have much
interest in being a part of, I think,

890
00:52:49,310 --> 00:52:53,180
I think it lacks authenticity.
I think at lax flavor,

891
00:52:53,181 --> 00:52:54,500
I think it lacks happiness.

892
00:52:54,501 --> 00:52:58,460
And Joy and all of that
goes into what a good,

893
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:00,200
good nourishment means to me.

894
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:04,540
And I think I see a role pre
made with elderly people and,

895
00:53:04,541 --> 00:53:08,890
and others for improved sort of
dietary supplement, you know, uh,

896
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:13,710
meals like that. But I don't think
that's a solution that, uh, I,

897
00:53:13,711 --> 00:53:17,480
for one, have any interest
in participating in, uh, uh,

898
00:53:17,481 --> 00:53:22,400
I think real good food grown properly
that supports the people who are growing

899
00:53:22,401 --> 00:53:24,800
at that supports the health of
the people who are eating it.

900
00:53:24,801 --> 00:53:29,100
That is damn good is where
we should all be, you know,

901
00:53:29,130 --> 00:53:29,963
driving for.

902
00:53:30,490 --> 00:53:31,240
Yeah.
I've,

903
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:34,930
I've done an about face on this stuff
because I've always been a kind of

904
00:53:34,931 --> 00:53:37,420
supplement addict and,
uh,

905
00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:42,310
been infatuated with pills and potions
and whatnot as, as supplementation.

906
00:53:42,311 --> 00:53:42,910
But I mean,
there's,

907
00:53:42,910 --> 00:53:47,910
they're called supplements for a reason
and I've really found that I'm echoing

908
00:53:48,071 --> 00:53:51,730
the sentiment of say, Nassim Taleb
wrote the Black Swan and antifragile.

909
00:53:51,910 --> 00:53:56,020
So he uses a term called a
epistemological or, yeah,

910
00:53:56,021 --> 00:53:57,190
epistemological arrogance,

911
00:53:57,191 --> 00:54:01,450
which is overestimating how much you
understand about it. Anything as a human,

912
00:54:01,451 --> 00:54:06,451
and I think it's naive to think I've
come to this conclusion anyway that you

913
00:54:06,731 --> 00:54:07,564
can,

914
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:12,660
that we would understand every element
of what's in an apple for instance,

915
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:16,690
or what's in a slice of
Ribeye. Like we, we just,

916
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:22,020
there's so much uncharted territory that
it's naive to think we could take the

917
00:54:22,751 --> 00:54:26,950
four or five things we've isolated,
put them in a pill and,

918
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:32,560
and, uh, sort of confer the same
nutritional benefit for instance.

919
00:54:32,561 --> 00:54:36,160
I mean, that's kind of pointing
them a one, but, um, yeah, it's,

920
00:54:36,161 --> 00:54:40,050
it's a very interesting, it's a
very fascinating subject, but I've,

921
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:43,120
I've gone completely in the,

922
00:54:43,121 --> 00:54:46,470
in the whole food direction just trying
to consume a spectrum of colors every

923
00:54:46,471 --> 00:54:49,630
day, for instance. Yeah. Um, the, um,

924
00:54:49,930 --> 00:54:52,060
so can I, do I want to add
some of that? Yeah, yeah.

925
00:54:52,061 --> 00:54:56,110
I think that is on the nutritional side
that that basic point and understanding

926
00:54:56,111 --> 00:54:58,810
of our limitations couldn't be more,
right.

927
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:02,650
I mean we've tried very
hard to kind of reduce, uh,

928
00:55:02,651 --> 00:55:07,651
our health to one vitamin or fiber or
this or that in a very reductionist way

929
00:55:08,830 --> 00:55:13,830
and utterly miss the interplay between
all of these different vitamins,

930
00:55:14,921 --> 00:55:15,850
nutrients,
fiber,

931
00:55:15,851 --> 00:55:19,770
protein and also by the way completely
miss how our body processes.

932
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:24,400
So it's turning out that, you know, we
have 100 trillion bacteria in our gut,

933
00:55:24,430 --> 00:55:28,960
100 trillion, which really what
we're doing is feeding that bacteria,

934
00:55:28,961 --> 00:55:32,390
which then in turn feeds
us and it's going to,

935
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:34,960
the evidence is emerging
that the microbiome,

936
00:55:34,990 --> 00:55:39,970
the gut bacteria is going to be one of
the most important things to focus on in

937
00:55:39,971 --> 00:55:41,440
terms of improving our health.

938
00:55:41,650 --> 00:55:45,190
And that we've lost quite a bit of
diversity in our gut and we don't,

939
00:55:45,310 --> 00:55:46,220
but there's,
you know,

940
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:51,340
a couple hundred a species of bacteria
in our gut a little less and we are just

941
00:55:51,911 --> 00:55:54,520
trying to figure out what does, what
and how they interact. And it's,

942
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:59,160
everybody's different. The complexities
here are just overwhelming. Um,

943
00:55:59,470 --> 00:56:02,170
we know that they need to
be fed a high diet of fiber,

944
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:05,890
lots of fruits and vegetables.
Basically what they feed and from birth.

945
00:56:05,891 --> 00:56:09,340
So like we, for a long time there
was parts of breast milk, the wheat,

946
00:56:09,370 --> 00:56:12,220
the baby's couldn't digest
and we didn't understand.

947
00:56:12,490 --> 00:56:13,690
We didn't think they were important,

948
00:56:13,691 --> 00:56:17,350
but turns out actually all those
elements in breast milk are feeding the

949
00:56:17,351 --> 00:56:20,530
emerging biome and the
young and the baby's got,

950
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:24,880
which is then gives it deals with the
immune and inflammation and all these

951
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:28,210
vital things and,
and digesting of food.

952
00:56:28,211 --> 00:56:31,960
So there's like the complexity is beyond
anything that we can comprehend right

953
00:56:31,961 --> 00:56:33,550
now. And, um,

954
00:56:33,551 --> 00:56:38,551
I think we have continually like
w over and over tried to say was,

955
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:42,940
oh, it's fat as the problem.
And like turns out, okay,
wait, fat's not the problem.

956
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:46,450
Well, it's a deficiency in Omega
this and I'll, okay, well turns out,

957
00:56:46,451 --> 00:56:49,570
well that's good, but it's not. Certainly
they'll panacea that was made out to be,

958
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:54,040
you know, every time we do this we get it
wrong. And so I, I agree with you. I mean,

959
00:56:54,041 --> 00:56:58,720
I think there's some things that have
been tested over the Millennia and um,

960
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:02,260
which his, that kind of balance,
good diet of whole grains.

961
00:57:02,261 --> 00:57:05,980
And lots of fruits and vegetables and
lean proteins. And I think that's where,

962
00:57:06,970 --> 00:57:11,770
um, we, we were safest is
when we stay in that kind of,

963
00:57:12,310 --> 00:57:13,480
uh,
that kind of space.

964
00:57:14,010 --> 00:57:18,810
And I'm glad you mentioned safest
because it's not just, oops,

965
00:57:18,811 --> 00:57:22,680
I didn't cover all my bases. When you
take a very reductionist approach,

966
00:57:23,310 --> 00:57:24,770
for instance, when people, uh,

967
00:57:24,930 --> 00:57:29,790
when the media got its hands on the
so called promises a Beta carotene,

968
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:33,660
right? People started consuming massive
amounts of Beta carotene in isolation.

969
00:57:33,661 --> 00:57:36,990
It can actually cause a lot of problems
when you're not sort of consuming it and

970
00:57:36,991 --> 00:57:41,050
it's natural, uh, environment,
so to speak. But yeah,

971
00:57:41,790 --> 00:57:45,720
I'd love to shift gears and ask you
some, uh, some rapid fire questions.

972
00:57:45,721 --> 00:57:48,560
They don't have to have
rapid answers, but, um,

973
00:57:48,870 --> 00:57:50,970
when you think of the word successful,

974
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:53,190
who's the first person
who comes to mind and why?

975
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:59,230
Mm, well, two people come
to mind. Uh, Barack Obama,

976
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:04,510
uh, and my, and my father, but
for wildly different reasons. Uh,

977
00:58:04,870 --> 00:58:08,140
I mean, Barack Obama's,
you know, success to me,

978
00:58:09,610 --> 00:58:11,310
I measure based on,
um,

979
00:58:12,070 --> 00:58:16,990
impact and the amount of impact that
I'm somebody who's trying to have in a

980
00:58:16,991 --> 00:58:20,110
positive way on the world around him.
Nothing money or,

981
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:23,400
but it's sort of what you do with the
place that you've been given and you know,

982
00:58:23,401 --> 00:58:26,350
um, there's lots of legitimate
disagreements in, in,

983
00:58:26,351 --> 00:58:30,000
in politics and I'm sure there's
legitimate disagreements with some of the

984
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:34,000
things that the president has has
done. And, but he is, you know,

985
00:58:34,001 --> 00:58:38,980
I know firsthand on a daily basis
that here's somebody who trying to,

986
00:58:39,070 --> 00:58:42,910
and it has had a massive positive
impact on the world around him. So that,

987
00:58:42,911 --> 00:58:45,830
that's something that, um, you know, I,

988
00:58:46,130 --> 00:58:50,450
I very much look up to and admire and,
and you know, in my small, much, much,

989
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:51,500
much smaller way,

990
00:58:51,501 --> 00:58:55,730
try to figure out how I can
have the biggest positive
impact on the world around

991
00:58:55,731 --> 00:58:59,420
me. And I'd say, but on the flip side,
you know, but that takes, you know,

992
00:58:59,421 --> 00:59:01,580
there's a lot of ambition that
goes with that and I'll, you know,

993
00:59:01,730 --> 00:59:05,440
disappointments when you fail. Um,
on the flip side, like success,

994
00:59:06,020 --> 00:59:09,830
my father is, um, he is a,
he's a fifth grade teacher.

995
00:59:09,831 --> 00:59:13,850
Has He just retired
after 25 years? Um, uh,

996
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:17,350
he lives at an incredibly humble
life and, you know, as a, you know,

997
00:59:17,351 --> 00:59:19,770
a union guy growing up and, and, and the,

998
00:59:19,771 --> 00:59:24,140
and the teacher and in a union guy
and sort of in the school. And He, um,

999
00:59:24,870 --> 00:59:28,650
he, he's utterly content. Uh, he,

1000
00:59:28,790 --> 00:59:32,900
he has a good community of
friends. He's, you know,

1001
00:59:32,901 --> 00:59:37,160
has a roof over his head and, and,
and meals on his table. In fact,

1002
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,290
when I first went to that
restaurant in Chicago,

1003
00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:42,260
he had never spent $20
on a meal for himself,

1004
00:59:42,261 --> 00:59:46,930
which I only found out when I invited
them in for a meal at the end of my summer

1005
00:59:46,970 --> 00:59:50,180
time there. Um, so he's
just very content in,

1006
00:59:50,181 --> 00:59:53,300
in like the simple pleasures and
the sort of a simple life. And I,

1007
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:57,230
and that's something that,
um, uh, is, you know, I,

1008
00:59:57,231 --> 01:00:01,280
I also try to take into what
success looks like is, is,

1009
01:00:01,281 --> 01:00:05,450
is that kind of contentness and
being appreciative of, of a,

1010
01:00:05,451 --> 01:00:06,410
of what you have,

1011
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:11,630
right. Having the appreciation, not
just the drive for achievement. Yeah.

1012
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:12,820
What's,

1013
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:17,820
what book or what is a book that you've
gifted most often are gifted very often

1014
01:00:18,341 --> 01:00:19,174
to other people.

1015
01:00:20,170 --> 01:00:21,003
Mm.

1016
01:00:21,390 --> 01:00:25,990
Have gift in Dod and pushing around the
art of fielding over the last year or

1017
01:00:25,991 --> 01:00:30,250
two, uh, by Chad Harbach.
I love that book. Um,

1018
01:00:30,730 --> 01:00:35,440
it's like, it's, it's, so it's a baseball
theme, but it's really about life and,

1019
01:00:35,470 --> 01:00:39,160
and all that goes with
that and complexities of
relationships. And I don't know,

1020
01:00:39,161 --> 01:00:43,000
there's something that book just sucked
me in and I love the feeling of being

1021
01:00:43,001 --> 01:00:47,590
sucked in, which, you know,
it doesn't happen with that
intensity too often. So I,

1022
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:48,670
that was a good one.

1023
01:00:48,670 --> 01:00:52,300
The Art of fielding. Are there
any, uh, any documentaries,

1024
01:00:52,330 --> 01:00:55,450
documentary films or movies that
have sucked you in, in that way?

1025
01:00:56,030 --> 01:01:00,810
Hmm. I love documentaries.
I'm a, I'm a big fan, uh,

1026
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:03,930
and a good and a great movie as well.
The,

1027
01:01:03,950 --> 01:01:06,230
the last one I just saw
actually it just came out, um,

1028
01:01:06,270 --> 01:01:10,050
which I really loved called just
eat it and it's about food waste.

1029
01:01:11,030 --> 01:01:14,810
We waste 40% of the food we produce,
uh,

1030
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:16,170
which is just insane.

1031
01:01:16,171 --> 01:01:20,880
There's no other major like life
system that is so inefficient.

1032
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:25,920
And then it's about this couple that,
um, basically for, I forget how long,

1033
01:01:25,921 --> 01:01:30,921
six months decides the only eat food
that they has been wasted that they find

1034
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:35,730
thrown away in some way, shape or
form. And it's unbelievable stories.

1035
01:01:35,731 --> 01:01:38,080
So really well done.
It's only an hour. Um,

1036
01:01:38,180 --> 01:01:40,260
I think it just aired on Msnbc actually,
but they,

1037
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:44,620
they are having to have to give away
food. They find so much of that, um,

1038
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:49,530
they can't eat it all and it's, so, it
was very powerful. Very well done. Um,

1039
01:01:49,620 --> 01:01:50,940
but that's the one that's top of mind.

1040
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:54,690
Awesome. Check that out. That,
uh, makes me think there's a book,

1041
01:01:55,030 --> 01:01:57,030
a read a long time ago,

1042
01:01:57,450 --> 01:02:01,740
I think it was called the man who gave
up money or the men who stopped using

1043
01:02:01,741 --> 01:02:03,000
money,
something along those lines.

1044
01:02:03,001 --> 01:02:06,690
But it delves into sort of the
dumpster diving freegan movement,

1045
01:02:06,691 --> 01:02:11,670
I guess they call them instead of
vegans. Really fascinating. Um, what's,

1046
01:02:11,910 --> 01:02:12,743
uh,

1047
01:02:13,290 --> 01:02:18,150
what's hundred dollars or less purchase
has had the biggest positive impact on

1048
01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:21,300
your life in the last six
months to a year? Let's just,

1049
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:23,790
whatever comes to mind doesn't
have to be in that time frame.

1050
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:29,010
Um, yeah, the recent purchase, I
got a, I got a kindle or recently,

1051
01:02:29,011 --> 01:02:33,860
which I now before, uh, which
has been great. Uh, you know, I,

1052
01:02:33,861 --> 01:02:35,680
I know people, I'm like
way behind, you know,

1053
01:02:35,740 --> 01:02:40,360
behind the curve and not the highest tech
way to read, read, read things. But it's,

1054
01:02:40,750 --> 01:02:43,600
but it's been great because I'm all over
the place and, and so that's helped.

1055
01:02:43,870 --> 01:02:47,010
I also got an ice bucket and uh,
uh,

1056
01:02:47,020 --> 01:02:50,710
it's made the rose aid that much
colder as summer's starting to hit.

1057
01:02:50,711 --> 01:02:54,310
And that's been, oh, an
investment. Well, worthwhile.

1058
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:59,490
That's a good call. Ice Bucket. Yeah.
Lovers and there's a great, you know,

1059
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:01,430
I, um, grew up on long island.

1060
01:03:01,431 --> 01:03:05,820
There's a wonderful rosé
from a wolf or a states. Uh,

1061
01:03:05,930 --> 01:03:07,280
I know that it's really good

1062
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:12,120
winemaker. Roman is just amazing.
I'm not too expensive either. What,

1063
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:17,080
what does the first 60
minutes of your day look like?

1064
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:18,910
Do you,
what are morning rituals,

1065
01:03:18,911 --> 01:03:23,740
whether when you were at the White
House or now that have been consistent?

1066
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:29,980
Um, so pretty consistent
basic routine. Um,

1067
01:03:30,290 --> 01:03:34,400
the one variable and that like,
I used to do a lot more.

1068
01:03:34,430 --> 01:03:35,810
I don't do it anymore.

1069
01:03:35,811 --> 01:03:40,811
Like first thing I love to do from a
perfect world is to do a short stint of

1070
01:03:40,881 --> 01:03:42,650
meditation for like 10 or 15 minutes.

1071
01:03:43,250 --> 01:03:45,820
It's been hard for me to keep
those impossible for me to do that.

1072
01:03:45,830 --> 01:03:46,940
The White House for whatever reason,

1073
01:03:46,941 --> 01:03:50,710
I just think mentally quieting and
slowing my mind was just something that is

1074
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:55,570
just say, wouldn't do as hard as hard
as I tried. Um, and exhaustion, uh,

1075
01:03:55,820 --> 01:03:59,300
also played a role, but I wake up and, um,

1076
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:03,860
a workout, uh, five or
six days a week. Um,

1077
01:04:03,930 --> 01:04:08,370
do about 30 minutes of Cardio and
then do weights, uh, various, uh,

1078
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:13,260
sort of sets. What type of cardio
do you do? So I'll do 10 minutes,

1079
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:13,660
uh,

1080
01:04:13,660 --> 01:04:18,660
on the bike and then now I'm
been doing a 12 minute interval,

1081
01:04:18,870 --> 01:04:22,190
interval run, run. And then I'm,

1082
01:04:22,210 --> 01:04:24,500
I'm doing like another 10 minutes, uh, in,

1083
01:04:24,570 --> 01:04:29,130
in like 12 incline walking
at 3.5 on the treadmill. Um,

1084
01:04:29,250 --> 01:04:33,180
sometimes I do the elliptical,
I'm in there and then,

1085
01:04:33,570 --> 01:04:38,340
and then do weights.
Um, and then, and then,

1086
01:04:38,341 --> 01:04:41,970
uh, so the White House, it was always,
you know, take a shower, get ready,

1087
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:46,560
and then I do oatmeal, a banana
and coffee. Since I'd been,

1088
01:04:46,780 --> 01:04:51,050
uh, out of the White House
I've been doing eggs. Um,

1089
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:54,190
one of the, you know,
a couple of ways, uh,

1090
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:59,010
some of my Colby tell us maybe some
avocado, salmon and then, and, and coffee.

1091
01:04:59,011 --> 01:05:01,350
That's been the routine
and then a way I go.

1092
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:04,860
Do you do it? Do you do anything
in particular before bed?

1093
01:05:06,410 --> 01:05:10,700
Uh hmm. I don't have that
same kind of routine at night.

1094
01:05:11,090 --> 01:05:14,030
Often cause nights there's
like much more variable.

1095
01:05:14,090 --> 01:05:18,790
Like the morning has always been
the time that I take for myself, um,

1096
01:05:18,970 --> 01:05:23,290
and carve out because after that it's
like anybody's guess what's going to

1097
01:05:23,291 --> 01:05:26,920
happen. Um, but try to, you know,
try to come bring down a little bit.

1098
01:05:26,921 --> 01:05:30,520
But oftentimes, and certainly the White
House, I was working until one, two,

1099
01:05:30,521 --> 01:05:34,330
three in the morning, um,
pretty consistently. So, um,

1100
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:36,280
it was sorta like you
worked til you fell off,

1101
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:40,490
fell off your chair and call it to bed
and then got up a few hours later and it

1102
01:05:40,530 --> 01:05:43,540
started doing it all over again. So, um,

1103
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:46,150
so I don't have that same
kind of night routine. Got It.

1104
01:05:47,210 --> 01:05:51,050
And when you, when you meditated,
what type of meditation did you do?

1105
01:05:51,051 --> 01:05:53,300
What did that,
what did that look like?

1106
01:05:54,130 --> 01:05:57,250
Um, so I, so I, the,

1107
01:05:57,340 --> 01:06:01,500
the woman who taught me is one of the
most amazing people I've ever known. Um,

1108
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:04,540
she was an 80 year old woman,
uh,

1109
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:08,140
who was actually from France who I met
when I was traveling on the border of

1110
01:06:08,141 --> 01:06:11,440
Malaysia and Thailand
on an overnight train.

1111
01:06:11,830 --> 01:06:16,830
She was 80 years old and she had spent
the last 20 plus years of her life just

1112
01:06:17,111 --> 01:06:20,230
traveling with a teeny little
for like eight pound backpack.

1113
01:06:20,231 --> 01:06:21,160
And that's all she had.

1114
01:06:21,550 --> 01:06:25,790
And she went everywhere and she was just
the most amazing person and she, um,

1115
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:30,370
so it's like a, you know, but she's not
like a, you know, formal teacher. So,

1116
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:35,080
you know, just trying to sit up, you know,
have good posture and just, you know,

1117
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:39,070
fundamentally relax and
focus on my breathing is like
as sophisticated as I got.

1118
01:06:39,610 --> 01:06:43,840
Um, and trying to let your
mind relax and repeating that,

1119
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:46,990
forcing your mind to get back to
that state, which is, you know,

1120
01:06:46,991 --> 01:06:51,310
it's always been such a
challenge. It's so hard. Um, uh,

1121
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:55,330
has as sort of how I would do it
for as long as I, as, as I could.

1122
01:06:55,331 --> 01:06:59,050
But when I do it, I feel so much
better and so much more grounded and,

1123
01:06:59,530 --> 01:07:03,520
and sort of calm through the day.
It's a,

1124
01:07:04,030 --> 01:07:08,800
but it takes a lot of discipline to
carve out the time. Um, in any given day.

1125
01:07:09,420 --> 01:07:13,650
Yeah. I've found for myself because I
meditate 15, 20 minutes each morning,

1126
01:07:14,390 --> 01:07:17,850
Eh, usually 20, uh, two things
really interesting. Number one,

1127
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:22,880
it takes about 15 minutes for me just to
let the dust and the or the mud settle.

1128
01:07:23,990 --> 01:07:24,823
Um,

1129
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:29,760
so I really only feel like I'm meditating
in the calm sensor last five minutes,

1130
01:07:29,761 --> 01:07:30,930
but it's the you need,

1131
01:07:30,990 --> 01:07:35,340
I need the 15 minutes just as a warm up
or cool down maybe. And then secondly,

1132
01:07:35,370 --> 01:07:40,370
that posture I've noticed if I just
sit with very good posture and kind of

1133
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:45,810
lengthen my spine, imagine my head
being kind of pulled up on a string.

1134
01:07:46,050 --> 01:07:48,900
Even if I don't get to some sublime state.

1135
01:07:48,901 --> 01:07:51,300
If I just focus and sit
that way for 20 minutes,

1136
01:07:51,301 --> 01:07:56,140
there's a huge benefit for
me anyway. I feel the same
way about that. Yup. Yup. Uh,

1137
01:07:56,220 --> 01:08:00,080
we'd love to ask some questions from,
uh,

1138
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:03,630
people on Facebook and Twitter who were
very excited that we were going to be

1139
01:08:03,631 --> 01:08:07,620
chatting. Uh, the first is a tough
one. Uh, but it's from Andrew Zimmern.

1140
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:11,220
Uh, Oh, I love that man.
He's awesome. Andrew's great.

1141
01:08:11,550 --> 01:08:14,910
That also has been on the podcast
and he wanted to ask some questions.

1142
01:08:15,170 --> 01:08:16,310
He hears them very often,

1143
01:08:16,311 --> 01:08:20,120
he gets asked them very often and it's
always curious how other people answer

1144
01:08:20,121 --> 01:08:22,790
them. So the first is, uh,

1145
01:08:22,820 --> 01:08:26,240
if it's illegal to sell cigarettes
to minors or drugs, slash. Booze,

1146
01:08:26,241 --> 01:08:29,240
why do we let fast food or
sugar drinks into schools?

1147
01:08:29,750 --> 01:08:34,600
Yeah, so, great question. So
a couple points. So one, uh,

1148
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:38,990
because of the new standards,
uh, that are in play, um,

1149
01:08:39,170 --> 01:08:43,110
there are no more sugary drinks
in schools and those are out. Um,

1150
01:08:43,430 --> 01:08:46,280
and I actually need to give the, you
know, the beverage homies credit,

1151
01:08:46,281 --> 01:08:51,170
they actually volunteerily voluntarily
pulled out most of those beverages around

1152
01:08:51,171 --> 01:08:53,060
starting in around 2007.

1153
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:56,450
But the new standards utterly
eliminate all sugary drinks.

1154
01:08:57,170 --> 01:08:59,090
You can have a low calorie in high school,

1155
01:08:59,091 --> 01:09:02,210
you could have a low calorie Gatorade
and you can have no calorie drinks.

1156
01:09:02,211 --> 01:09:04,280
So Diet Sodas are allowed in high schools,

1157
01:09:04,281 --> 01:09:07,850
not in middle schools and
certainly not in lower schools. Um,

1158
01:09:07,851 --> 01:09:11,220
so those drinks are out
on the fast food side. Um,

1159
01:09:12,070 --> 01:09:16,390
I have always been pretty
appalled that as some of these,

1160
01:09:16,540 --> 01:09:20,160
particularly the last healthy companies
have set up shop in high schools.

1161
01:09:20,170 --> 01:09:22,600
Now this is not ubiquitous by
any stretch of the imagination,

1162
01:09:22,601 --> 01:09:24,700
but they definitely exist in some number.

1163
01:09:25,180 --> 01:09:29,680
And I actually need to look and see
because their food does not meet the

1164
01:09:29,681 --> 01:09:33,310
standards. So unless they're
changing their offerings.

1165
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:35,800
So I am not sure how many,
like where,

1166
01:09:35,801 --> 01:09:40,720
where they are in the evolution of either
what they're offering in schools or if

1167
01:09:40,721 --> 01:09:43,000
some of them have had to pull
out, you know, the truth is,

1168
01:09:43,001 --> 01:09:44,170
I don't know the answer that,
but I'll,

1169
01:09:44,171 --> 01:09:47,110
I'll dig into that and come back
to you on it. Um, but I agree.

1170
01:09:47,111 --> 01:09:51,820
I think it's really inappropriate
to be serving,

1171
01:09:51,850 --> 01:09:55,750
you know, have a fast food, pretty
unhealthy restaurant set up in a,

1172
01:09:55,751 --> 01:09:57,550
in a high school.
I find that to be,

1173
01:09:57,850 --> 01:09:59,620
I've always found that
to be very off putting.

1174
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,220
Cool. Uh, yeah,

1175
01:10:03,250 --> 01:10:06,790
we'd love for people listening
who participate on the blog. Uh,

1176
01:10:06,791 --> 01:10:09,820
obviously there'll be a post with all
the links and resources and so on,

1177
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:11,770
including things like, uh, you know,

1178
01:10:11,771 --> 01:10:14,320
organizations like American farmland
trust that have done stuff with,

1179
01:10:14,321 --> 01:10:16,270
if you want to sort of get
involved with some of these things.

1180
01:10:16,271 --> 01:10:21,271
But I would love to hear ideas for what
types of campaigns or angles could be

1181
01:10:23,321 --> 01:10:27,950
taken to remedy that from folks. Uh,
I do pay attention to the comments up.

1182
01:10:27,980 --> 01:10:32,620
Next question is from cinema air.
This is on Twitter. Best use of wine,

1183
01:10:32,621 --> 01:10:33,940
that's too old to drink.

1184
01:10:34,870 --> 01:10:39,060
So, um, you know, depending on the kind
of wine and you know, I think there's,

1185
01:10:39,250 --> 01:10:41,830
there's probably a little mad at depending
on where you are and how it goes,

1186
01:10:41,831 --> 01:10:46,300
but you know, that's how you
make vinegar. So, uh, you know,

1187
01:10:46,301 --> 01:10:50,560
grape juice turns into vinegar,
right? So, um, there you could, you,

1188
01:10:50,620 --> 01:10:54,100
depending on how close you can use
it, kind of in that, in that way,

1189
01:10:54,490 --> 01:10:59,380
a lot of people use it for
cooking, but you know, no,

1190
01:10:59,381 --> 01:11:04,210
no real chef would say you should,
uh, if it's not good to drink,

1191
01:11:04,211 --> 01:11:08,530
whether it's really not good to cook with.
So the truth is like there's a,

1192
01:11:09,430 --> 01:11:13,110
there's not much to do with it. I
gotta be honest. I would get that.

1193
01:11:13,210 --> 01:11:16,080
At least not that I know. Um, maybe
somebody out there has got a good thing,

1194
01:11:16,081 --> 01:11:19,950
but basically like drink it before
it goes bad is my best advice to you.

1195
01:11:20,370 --> 01:11:22,410
And you know, the thing that, you know,

1196
01:11:22,411 --> 01:11:26,870
if you get just one of those simple air
pumps with, with the, with the rubber top,

1197
01:11:26,871 --> 01:11:31,560
it pulls the air out, you add, you know,
a week or two depending on the wine,

1198
01:11:31,990 --> 01:11:36,720
a life to it. And that's what I use.
You know, we use that in our house. Um,

1199
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:39,830
and it makes a big difference
because there's nothing worth,

1200
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:42,930
there's like one of the worst feelings
in the world is dumping out a half a

1201
01:11:42,931 --> 01:11:46,140
bottle of wine that you didn't
get the finish. Yeah. Pain.

1202
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:50,200
The, the vacuum is really cheap
and really effective. I, yeah,

1203
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:55,100
I use the same device,
uh, on that point. Uh,

1204
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:58,310
Stephan, I think it's Stephan. Um,

1205
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:01,700
Bendel what should home chefs stop doing?

1206
01:12:02,540 --> 01:12:03,980
So wasting wine would be one.

1207
01:12:05,630 --> 01:12:10,340
Wow. What should home chef that doing?
La, there's, there's a few things.

1208
01:12:10,430 --> 01:12:13,330
Um, watch it. Home chefs started.

1209
01:12:13,340 --> 01:12:17,450
Do I need to spend more time with home
chefs to give you the best answer?

1210
01:12:17,690 --> 01:12:22,690
I think dragging the knife across the
cutting board like as like a shovel is

1211
01:12:22,911 --> 01:12:24,710
something that like you
never supposed to do.

1212
01:12:24,711 --> 01:12:26,900
If you need to like move like
the vegetables of scoop them up,

1213
01:12:26,901 --> 01:12:28,640
use the backside of the knife,

1214
01:12:29,150 --> 01:12:31,970
but like scraping the knife on the
cutting board just drives me crazy.

1215
01:12:31,971 --> 01:12:36,080
It's just really bad for your
knife. Dulls it immediately. Um,

1216
01:12:36,110 --> 01:12:40,680
something that I cringe at. I think,
um, chest, the home cooks need to um,

1217
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:44,960
work with heat. Uh, I like
not be afraid of, of of heat.

1218
01:12:44,961 --> 01:12:48,500
More so particularly when you're sharing
fish, it's like you need that pant hat.

1219
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:51,350
And so letting,
like putting it in,

1220
01:12:51,351 --> 01:12:54,680
like getting your pants super hot and
then putting your fish down and leaving it

1221
01:12:55,220 --> 01:12:58,580
and not touching it and letting
it get that Nice, you know,

1222
01:12:58,850 --> 01:13:02,090
a good sear, good Golden Brown
on it before you touch it.

1223
01:13:02,540 --> 01:13:06,080
It's like key to fish and those, most
people don't get their pan hot enough,

1224
01:13:06,110 --> 01:13:07,880
don't heat it,
don't ever get it out and up.

1225
01:13:07,881 --> 01:13:11,210
Don't take the time to heat it and
then play around with the fish, which,

1226
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:15,710
which ends up really hurting. It's its
ultimate um, feel. But I think allowing,

1227
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:16,350
I think babies,

1228
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:21,020
the one thing that's the big difference
between a pro and a home cook is that

1229
01:13:21,021 --> 01:13:24,350
like the see the getting
real color on things.

1230
01:13:24,351 --> 01:13:28,220
Be it meat or any vegetable that's on
the grill or anything you're putting in

1231
01:13:28,221 --> 01:13:31,280
the pan. Like just let it go
when you think it's like ready.

1232
01:13:31,281 --> 01:13:34,400
Like give it another minute or
two and like get that really dark,

1233
01:13:34,610 --> 01:13:37,160
dark color on it.
It adds a ton of flavor.

1234
01:13:37,430 --> 01:13:42,430
When can you tell that your pan is hot
enough for that nice sear on a fish.

1235
01:13:43,470 --> 01:13:45,000
So like when you put the oil in,

1236
01:13:45,001 --> 01:13:48,630
like you don't want it to immediately
start smoking. Like then your oils done.

1237
01:13:48,631 --> 01:13:51,720
Like, don't put it in there. If it's
like you put it in, it's like smoke,

1238
01:13:52,050 --> 01:13:55,820
but like you should see the oil,
get that kind of those lines in it,

1239
01:13:55,821 --> 01:13:59,880
that kind of Shimmer and it should just
start to go off a little bit of like you

1240
01:13:59,881 --> 01:14:04,290
could see to us and little that
a smoke. Um, that's when you're,

1241
01:14:04,291 --> 01:14:06,630
you're ready to go. But
it should be like, ha.

1242
01:14:07,020 --> 01:14:08,910
Like when you put it in and she'd be like,
you're like,

1243
01:14:08,911 --> 01:14:12,760
it shouldn't be like go crazy. Like if
it's just like a little mild bubble,

1244
01:14:12,761 --> 01:14:14,350
like you're not,
you weren't ready.

1245
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:18,420
And what, what type of oil do you like
to use with, with fish? For instance?

1246
01:14:18,950 --> 01:14:21,650
Um, you know, you can use a
lot. Like you can use olive oil,

1247
01:14:21,651 --> 01:14:25,310
it has a lower smoke point, but you
can, you can get away with it. Um,

1248
01:14:25,580 --> 01:14:29,810
I like grape seed oil is a great
oil to cook with. Um, uh, you know,

1249
01:14:29,811 --> 01:14:33,440
you can do high. He canola
is totally fine. Um,

1250
01:14:34,070 --> 01:14:38,780
uh, those are probably the main ones
to go with. Peanut oil is awesome.

1251
01:14:38,930 --> 01:14:40,550
That's expensive.
Yeah.

1252
01:14:40,551 --> 01:14:45,050
I've been playing myself a little bit
with avocado oil because it has high omega

1253
01:14:45,051 --> 01:14:49,220
three content, decent smoke
point, but it's so rich

1254
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:54,890
depending on the food UniKey easily or
enhance or completely contaminate what

1255
01:14:54,891 --> 01:14:56,960
you're doing to try to make,
uh,

1256
01:14:57,830 --> 01:15:00,690
this question is from chaos and Nata.
Uh,

1257
01:15:00,740 --> 01:15:03,690
when you fall into a Rut in the kitchen,
uh,

1258
01:15:04,010 --> 01:15:07,400
what book resource or person
do you turn to for inspiration?

1259
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,820
Oh, interesting. Um, so I
don't, yeah, it's a good,

1260
01:15:11,870 --> 01:15:16,870
I mean I try to get out and eat or go
to the store or go like see and feel and

1261
01:15:18,081 --> 01:15:21,650
touch and smell is the thing
that I try to do when I'm,

1262
01:15:21,710 --> 01:15:24,760
when I'm just sort of feel dad and
use the actual ingredient soon,

1263
01:15:24,761 --> 01:15:29,150
inspire what I'm going to do. But I'd
say the book that I read that I look at,

1264
01:15:30,110 --> 01:15:32,510
I really don't look at
cookbooks a ton anymore,

1265
01:15:32,511 --> 01:15:36,470
but the one recently that I have is all
of auto language's books are awesome.

1266
01:15:36,620 --> 01:15:39,820
How do you, Oh, wait a second
here. I know this name. Uh, how,

1267
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:41,690
how do you spell that
name or the first name?

1268
01:15:41,970 --> 01:15:46,320
Um, a little lag at
lemme. Lemme. Um, O. O. T.

1269
01:15:46,321 --> 01:15:50,940
T. O. L. E. N. Uh, let me let,
let me just pull it up for you.

1270
01:15:51,990 --> 01:15:56,700
Um, Ott, o. L. E. N. G. H. I,

1271
01:15:57,250 --> 01:16:02,040
uh, he is an incredible chef.
Him and his partner, uh,

1272
01:16:02,041 --> 01:16:06,180
actually one is, he's a, you know,
there are Palestinian and Israeli,

1273
01:16:06,650 --> 01:16:10,890
uh, uh, team couple and um,

1274
01:16:11,340 --> 01:16:14,370
they have plenty is probably
their most famous book,

1275
01:16:14,371 --> 01:16:16,650
but they have Jerusalem and plenty more.

1276
01:16:16,651 --> 01:16:21,651
Their books are just spectacular and
the recipes are simple but so delicious.

1277
01:16:22,530 --> 01:16:25,650
Um, I, I definitely cooked a few
out of them and they're always,

1278
01:16:25,890 --> 01:16:26,723
they're always awesome.

1279
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:32,520
If someone is new to healthy cooking,
where would you suggest they start?

1280
01:16:32,521 --> 01:16:36,690
What could they start with as
anything simple they could,

1281
01:16:36,810 --> 01:16:41,040
they could use to get the ball
rolling in terms of like a dish,

1282
01:16:43,150 --> 01:16:47,940
a dish, stocking the kitchen.
Unstacking stocking the kitchen. It was,

1283
01:16:47,941 --> 01:16:51,510
it's, it's a general question. So I'd say
you can interpret it any way you want.

1284
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:54,280
So I think the key is
like starting simple.

1285
01:16:54,310 --> 01:16:57,160
And I think people whenever
they approached like, okay,
I want to make a change.

1286
01:16:57,430 --> 01:16:59,230
They think I got to overhaul everything.

1287
01:16:59,530 --> 01:17:03,400
And so then they tried to do a dramatic
thing and then then of course it's not

1288
01:17:03,401 --> 01:17:04,890
sustainable.
You can't keep that up.

1289
01:17:04,940 --> 01:17:08,950
You revert back to kind of who you've
been and it then you just completely

1290
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:12,740
stopped. So I would think like little
things. So one place to start is vinegar.

1291
01:17:12,770 --> 01:17:17,330
If you want to start with a small like
getting really good vinegar makes us like

1292
01:17:17,331 --> 01:17:20,780
a salad, go from really
uninspired, so really delicious.

1293
01:17:20,781 --> 01:17:22,700
So one place that I did
actually invest a little,

1294
01:17:22,701 --> 01:17:25,880
if you're going to invest a little
resource in is getting some really nice

1295
01:17:25,881 --> 01:17:30,100
vinegar to make really beautiful
salads and salads or like some, some,

1296
01:17:30,110 --> 01:17:35,040
some kind of green, like a good combo
is some kind of some kind of leaf. Um,

1297
01:17:35,330 --> 01:17:39,680
some kind of texture. We had cucumber,
fennel or you know, various things,

1298
01:17:40,260 --> 01:17:43,070
acidity. So you could add, you
know, any kind of citrus fruit,

1299
01:17:43,110 --> 01:17:45,500
there's always great or
just a really nice vinegar,

1300
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:48,690
some nuts of some kind and achieves.
There's unkind,

1301
01:17:48,740 --> 01:17:52,880
like a farmer Xan or Pecorino
or different, if you like,

1302
01:17:52,940 --> 01:17:57,440
that kind of basic components. It's hard
to really make it terrible. Sometimes,

1303
01:17:57,441 --> 01:18:00,110
Geez can throw you off.
So you can play around with that.

1304
01:18:00,710 --> 01:18:02,930
But you get good texture,
you get good flavor.

1305
01:18:02,931 --> 01:18:06,350
And if you have a nice vinegar like the
world is yours and that's a really good

1306
01:18:06,351 --> 01:18:10,640
place to just add some salad on
and you know, to your dinner is a,

1307
01:18:11,300 --> 01:18:14,870
is a great place to start. But I would
just try to add a piece of fruit,

1308
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:18,200
try to add another thing
of vegetables at dinner.

1309
01:18:18,470 --> 01:18:21,350
Like if you just start there,
those two things.

1310
01:18:21,351 --> 01:18:25,550
And I think the other main thing to
start is drinking more water. Um, it,

1311
01:18:25,551 --> 01:18:28,430
there's nothing better than water.
The more water you drink,

1312
01:18:28,431 --> 01:18:31,670
the less sugary beverages
you're going to drink,

1313
01:18:31,671 --> 01:18:36,110
which is really key if you're going
to try to live a healthier life.

1314
01:18:36,140 --> 01:18:41,120
And um, you know that that's a great
place to start. And then from there,

1315
01:18:41,121 --> 01:18:42,380
you can you build from there.

1316
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:43,360
Yeah.

1317
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:47,140
The one or just to echo that for people
who might be following a diet of any

1318
01:18:47,141 --> 01:18:50,230
type of slow carb or Paleo or
whatever to try to lose fat.

1319
01:18:50,260 --> 01:18:54,370
If your liver is burdened
by even partial dehydration,

1320
01:18:54,371 --> 01:18:59,371
it's just not going to do a very good
job of helping you to you to oxidize fat.

1321
01:19:00,191 --> 01:19:03,850
So I've, I've noticed tremendously even
with getting into say ketosis because I'm

1322
01:19:03,851 --> 01:19:08,070
experimenting with that more water.
I drink, the more I walk, uh,

1323
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:13,540
the better off I am, the faster I'll drop
into a state of ketosis. Um, but, uh, the,

1324
01:19:13,550 --> 01:19:17,650
the other thing,
just on your point with nuts and cheese,

1325
01:19:18,220 --> 01:19:21,730
if, if I've, it seems
like with almost any dish,

1326
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:24,580
if someone wants to
impress a dinner guest,

1327
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:28,710
just put Parmesan and sliced almonds
on anything and it looks real.

1328
01:19:28,810 --> 01:19:32,260
It looks really fancy and
it tastes amazing. Yeah. Uh,

1329
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:37,600
and on that note, uh, this
is, will McClellan, uh,

1330
01:19:38,890 --> 01:19:43,000
there may not be a best meal, but what's
the best meal to impress a girl with?

1331
01:19:43,001 --> 01:19:46,780
But it's easy to make. This
is, I'm sure a question.

1332
01:19:46,810 --> 01:19:50,980
This is guys have a phobia. A lot of
guys have cooking in any capacity.

1333
01:19:50,981 --> 01:19:55,540
So what would be one meal that might
impress a girl? But that is easy to make.

1334
01:19:56,530 --> 01:20:01,000
That's funny. Uh, well I was just talking
to one of my best friends, in fact,

1335
01:20:01,001 --> 01:20:05,780
that guy who was with me in Vienna
and then he was telling me about, uh,

1336
01:20:06,350 --> 01:20:09,930
a date he was on in just yesterday
and he was saying, Oh yeah,

1337
01:20:09,931 --> 01:20:12,360
I cook that risotto again. I, you know,
he's like, man, yeah, you tell me that,

1338
01:20:12,361 --> 01:20:16,820
that one time. And I've grown with
that for the last 10 years. Uh,

1339
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:21,980
I think it was, oh, it's a really
good, very easy dish, uh, to make that,

1340
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:26,570
um, that you can do a lot of things with
that seems very fancy and impressive,

1341
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:30,820
but isn't that hard. Uh, basic
risotto is you start, you know,

1342
01:20:30,830 --> 01:20:34,820
start with like an onion or shallot.
You Cook that down, you cook your rice,

1343
01:20:34,821 --> 01:20:37,160
you have a stock of some kind,

1344
01:20:37,190 --> 01:20:41,130
so you can buy a nice chicken stock or uh,

1345
01:20:41,950 --> 01:20:44,590
seafood stock depending on what you're
gonna put in there and make sure that hot

1346
01:20:45,070 --> 01:20:49,960
and then you're just adding some stock
as you go and you go. So sorry, onions.

1347
01:20:49,961 --> 01:20:50,830
And then you put the rice in it,

1348
01:20:50,831 --> 01:20:53,530
mix it around a little white
wine and let that evaporate.

1349
01:20:53,890 --> 01:20:57,490
And then you're just adding stock as
you go until the rice is like done.

1350
01:20:57,550 --> 01:21:00,580
Do you want it to be a little, you know,
dente that you want it to be a little,

1351
01:21:00,581 --> 01:21:03,550
have a little tooth to it's
you don't want it mushy. Um,

1352
01:21:03,820 --> 01:21:05,230
and then just finish it
with whatever you want.

1353
01:21:05,231 --> 01:21:08,350
If you're going to have like some scallops
and there you can do a whole seafood

1354
01:21:08,351 --> 01:21:12,500
thing. You can do a lamb or Zoho, you
could, you can do a vegetable risotto,

1355
01:21:12,520 --> 01:21:15,370
you can do anything you want and it's
hard to mess it up because you finish it

1356
01:21:15,371 --> 01:21:19,500
with a little butter or some olive oil
and a bunch of Parmesan cheese. So like,

1357
01:21:19,501 --> 01:21:22,840
it's like hard to go wrong there.
Um,

1358
01:21:23,030 --> 01:21:26,390
and it's sort of one of those dishes that,
uh,

1359
01:21:26,900 --> 01:21:29,180
it's hard to make it
perfect, but it's, it's,

1360
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:32,250
it's easy to make it good,
easy to make it good.

1361
01:21:33,420 --> 01:21:36,620
It's so true for so many
things in life. Right. Um, so,

1362
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:39,600
so I want to get a little granular on
this cause that actually like to try to

1363
01:21:39,601 --> 01:21:44,070
make it this weekend. So you, you, you
take the onions or shallots, those are,

1364
01:21:44,450 --> 01:21:47,710
uh, pretty thinly sliced, right?

1365
01:21:48,340 --> 01:21:52,480
You want a dice those up, you want to
make them very small dice, like a mint.

1366
01:21:52,630 --> 01:21:56,620
Got It. And then you throw that
in the pan or pot, I guess,

1367
01:21:56,621 --> 01:21:59,560
pot in this case with some like
olive oil and you just, uh,

1368
01:21:59,980 --> 01:22:01,110
would you have olive oil?
Would you,

1369
01:22:01,180 --> 01:22:02,800
would you have some type of
oil in there to start with?

1370
01:22:02,870 --> 01:22:06,950
Yup. Yup. So yeah, some olive oil, you put
that in and you cook it a little bit. Um,

1371
01:22:07,230 --> 01:22:09,090
then you put in your rice and you know,
you've,

1372
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:13,370
depending on how many people you have,
you know, Cup Cup to two cups. You know,

1373
01:22:13,371 --> 01:22:15,890
if you're not doing a ton, you know, a
cup of rice should probably be enough.

1374
01:22:15,891 --> 01:22:20,010
If it's too, we'll will be enough. Two
people, then you cook that a little bit,

1375
01:22:20,011 --> 01:22:23,130
get that covered and coded
and then you add, you know,

1376
01:22:23,131 --> 01:22:25,260
a bit of of white wine.

1377
01:22:25,490 --> 01:22:27,480
Now the stock is the
stock already in there.

1378
01:22:28,270 --> 01:22:29,980
The stock's not in.
Their stock should be in a separate,

1379
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:33,580
separate pot and it should be,
you should, it should be hot.

1380
01:22:33,581 --> 01:22:37,340
You should bring that to a boil
and keep that warm. Got It. Um,

1381
01:22:37,750 --> 01:22:42,090
onions. Then the cook that down and let
it kind of caramelize a little bit. Uh,

1382
01:22:42,140 --> 01:22:45,700
not, you don't want to color on it, you
don't want to color. Okay. And then you,

1383
01:22:45,730 --> 01:22:49,350
then you had the rise, then you
add, so you have a cup of rice.

1384
01:22:49,351 --> 01:22:50,940
How much white wine
would you put in there?

1385
01:22:52,380 --> 01:22:54,640
Yeah, I'm not sure. And I'm
not a great recipe guy. Like,

1386
01:22:54,641 --> 01:22:57,760
you just want to get a nice like couple
of splashes in, they're like, oh,

1387
01:22:57,761 --> 01:23:02,730
that's fine. I don't know, maybe like
a quarter cup. Okay. Um, at the most.

1388
01:23:02,731 --> 01:23:06,430
And then you, you cook that down. So you
want, when you, when you know you're,

1389
01:23:06,431 --> 01:23:07,900
you want to get rid of all the alcohol.

1390
01:23:08,260 --> 01:23:12,220
So you know that like when you lean
over the potty, you kind of put the,

1391
01:23:12,250 --> 01:23:15,130
what's evaporating kind of you,
you put your mouth nose over that.

1392
01:23:15,340 --> 01:23:17,320
If it kind of burns the
inside of your nose,

1393
01:23:17,590 --> 01:23:19,510
you know that there's
still alcohol burning off.

1394
01:23:19,900 --> 01:23:23,770
And like once that sort of burning
sensation comes and it's just like, okay,

1395
01:23:23,771 --> 01:23:26,440
that smells good, then you know,
you're, you're ready to go.

1396
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:29,940
It should be pretty dry. It
should be drive basically, um,

1397
01:23:30,190 --> 01:23:31,960
before you then start adding your stock.

1398
01:23:32,230 --> 01:23:35,950
Got It. And then how long once
you had the stock, is the,

1399
01:23:35,980 --> 01:23:40,150
this sort of cocktail, is it on like
a medium feed or what's the heat?

1400
01:23:40,450 --> 01:23:43,270
Yeah. So you want it to
be a nice simmer, um,

1401
01:23:43,330 --> 01:23:48,220
uncovered simmer and you only use a
wooden spoon because you don't want to

1402
01:23:48,221 --> 01:23:52,940
damage the rice and you only want to
use a Borio rice. Really important, uh,

1403
01:23:53,380 --> 01:23:55,540
which is a nice starchy rice.
So you'll get a good,

1404
01:23:55,870 --> 01:24:00,370
a nice starchy kind of a broth.
And so when you, so yeah, so you,

1405
01:24:00,371 --> 01:24:04,990
so you just add the stock as you
go. So you cook it, you know,

1406
01:24:05,290 --> 01:24:09,520
it'll start absorbing you guys. Okay. I'll
need some more. You started absorbing,

1407
01:24:09,550 --> 01:24:12,640
you keep adding and now if you run out
of stock you can finish with water.

1408
01:24:12,641 --> 01:24:16,630
No problem. Um, uh, you know,
you want to heat the water up.

1409
01:24:16,660 --> 01:24:20,070
You don't want to put in a cold liquid
into your Giotto cause that stops all the

1410
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:23,740
cooking process and kind of start breaking
down the rights over if you do that

1411
01:24:23,741 --> 01:24:24,574
too much

1412
01:24:24,660 --> 01:24:27,570
decided I'm going to try this this weekend
because it seems like you could also,

1413
01:24:27,630 --> 01:24:31,260
for instance with like scallops which
are so deceptively easy to cook,

1414
01:24:31,740 --> 01:24:35,280
you can kind of muck around
with the risotto and if
you're kind of flying by the

1415
01:24:35,281 --> 01:24:37,530
seat of your pants and
half screwing it up,

1416
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:41,670
since the scallops only take whenever you
know, four minutes, two minutes to cook,

1417
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:45,240
um, you can kind of do it last
minute and just drop them in.

1418
01:24:45,740 --> 01:24:47,990
Yeah. So for like if you're using
the base cops, the little guy,

1419
01:24:47,991 --> 01:24:51,490
it's like basically when you were,
Zoho is basically done or just, yeah,

1420
01:24:51,491 --> 01:24:52,191
you put them in,

1421
01:24:52,191 --> 01:24:55,700
you just give it a stir and he'd turn
it off and like they'll basically cooked

1422
01:24:55,701 --> 01:24:59,240
through, uh, just as it settles cause
you want, you'll want, so at the end,

1423
01:24:59,241 --> 01:25:03,430
so you cook it, it's getting close
whenever you're done. So like Bateman,

1424
01:25:03,431 --> 01:25:04,020
it's basically done.

1425
01:25:04,020 --> 01:25:06,240
Then you put in your primary John
and you put it in some butter,

1426
01:25:06,241 --> 01:25:09,210
you put in a little olive oil
and you give that a good stir,

1427
01:25:09,860 --> 01:25:13,440
you're going to want to let it just
rest for a minute and it'll kind of come

1428
01:25:13,441 --> 01:25:16,380
together. If it dries up, like
when you put it on the plate,

1429
01:25:16,381 --> 01:25:18,450
you wanted to just kind
of relax onto the plate.

1430
01:25:18,451 --> 01:25:22,290
Like you don't want to hold up and kind
of a ball. You don't want to run either.

1431
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:25,530
So you may need to add a little
stock to you, make it, you know,

1432
01:25:25,531 --> 01:25:29,550
it should feel like it's got a little
soft but if not saucy, right? And,

1433
01:25:29,551 --> 01:25:31,320
but then you can literally
add whatever you want.

1434
01:25:31,350 --> 01:25:34,320
Any kind of herbs at any
flavor profile that you like.

1435
01:25:34,321 --> 01:25:39,321
Like if I love Bazell
asparagus and Zucchini,

1436
01:25:40,170 --> 01:25:43,230
I can add that at the end.
Let that basically warm up.

1437
01:25:43,231 --> 01:25:47,070
And you guys just have a beautiful
[inaudible] if you're doing scallops.

1438
01:25:47,071 --> 01:25:51,270
I love like a lemon seafood risotto
so you can add a bunch of lemon juice,

1439
01:25:51,271 --> 01:25:54,210
a ton of lemon.
Jeff possessed like lots of lemons asked,

1440
01:25:54,211 --> 01:25:59,160
maybe Swedes have a Lennon and say
shrimp and scallops and an terragon.

1441
01:25:59,161 --> 01:26:02,940
It's a great herb for that one
killer risotto. So you can,

1442
01:26:03,380 --> 01:26:06,850
that one will impress any, any
lady, m whoever, whoever asked that.

1443
01:26:08,570 --> 01:26:13,130
I'm going to try that. The Saturday.
A question from Carrie Kim Minsky.

1444
01:26:13,310 --> 01:26:17,690
Uh, what dish have you most
frequently made for house guests?

1445
01:26:18,910 --> 01:26:22,180
Wow.
Most this most frequently made.

1446
01:26:23,110 --> 01:26:27,100
I don't know the answer to that to be
honest with you. I mean, I love the grill.

1447
01:26:27,101 --> 01:26:31,510
I'm a just a grill freak. It's
super simple. Less dishes,

1448
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:36,010
uh, and biggest flavor. So I
throw like PR when it's warm.

1449
01:26:36,011 --> 01:26:39,440
I throw everything on the grill, I
grill all of that. Stubbles like I,

1450
01:26:39,640 --> 01:26:44,260
we grow eggplant, we grow where
Piney, we grilled peppers, Zucchini.

1451
01:26:44,290 --> 01:26:46,400
I just,
it just all goes up there and took,

1452
01:26:46,420 --> 01:26:49,030
it's really healthy way to cook because
you're using very little. There's,

1453
01:26:49,031 --> 01:26:52,840
you don't need much, you know,
there's no heavy fats or anything. Um,

1454
01:26:53,620 --> 01:26:57,220
and I've been doing pork chops up there,
some stake,

1455
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:02,610
even pieces of fish depending on
what it is. Shrimp. So, I dunno,

1456
01:27:02,620 --> 01:27:07,160
I just, I just try to keep it fun
and simple. I think the one thing is,

1457
01:27:07,170 --> 01:27:08,080
it's actually kind of reminds me,

1458
01:27:08,081 --> 01:27:12,400
I think the one other difference between
home cooks and and pros is just acidity

1459
01:27:12,401 --> 01:27:16,300
level. Like at when you think it's ready,
like add another lemon. Yeah, totally.

1460
01:27:16,570 --> 01:27:19,660
We always like pros bump up
the, the, the acidity level,

1461
01:27:19,661 --> 01:27:23,070
which is what is like one of the
Sikh that's like one of the secrets.

1462
01:27:23,090 --> 01:27:26,320
Just we add a little more acid and it
makes everything taste better. Yeah.

1463
01:27:26,321 --> 01:27:26,830
It seems,

1464
01:27:26,830 --> 01:27:31,830
it seems like pros use lemon juice is
as they might use salt at the time.

1465
01:27:32,780 --> 01:27:37,270
Yeah. Uh, what are some of the mistakes
that people make with grilling?

1466
01:27:38,530 --> 01:27:42,490
Um, what do they make with
grilling one? The grills not hot,

1467
01:27:42,730 --> 01:27:47,590
so they ended up not getting
very good color, um, to,

1468
01:27:47,680 --> 01:27:52,370
I think that's the, that's the
main mistake. Um, I think, uh,

1469
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:55,570
they also like play with food too.
Like when you throw it on there,

1470
01:27:55,571 --> 01:27:59,920
like let it go, let it get that nice
color and before you start moving around,

1471
01:28:00,100 --> 01:28:03,610
um, and um, you know,

1472
01:28:03,611 --> 01:28:06,750
I think grills are best
when you get to see her,

1473
01:28:06,751 --> 01:28:08,740
but like if you're doing a piece
of meat or even a piece of fish,

1474
01:28:09,010 --> 01:28:11,620
letting it finish in the oven,
even just for a minute or two,

1475
01:28:11,710 --> 01:28:14,680
depending on how big your
piece of, uh, of meat is, the,

1476
01:28:14,860 --> 01:28:17,620
is the best way to do it because it,
it'll cook more evenly.

1477
01:28:18,010 --> 01:28:20,290
A lot of times if you are
using a really hot grill,

1478
01:28:20,530 --> 01:28:24,610
you'll get like a lot of well done and
then like a little bit of rare or medium

1479
01:28:24,611 --> 01:28:28,030
rare in the middle, but like the
sides will be super dry and tough.

1480
01:28:28,510 --> 01:28:30,940
So if you get a really hot grill,
got a great sear,

1481
01:28:30,941 --> 01:28:32,950
you'll lock the flavor and
then you finish in the oven.

1482
01:28:32,951 --> 01:28:34,420
And it's always the best way to do it,

1483
01:28:34,490 --> 01:28:38,030
yeah. To, to avoid the black
and blue steak. Yeah. Uh,

1484
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:42,530
next question is from Daniel Law.
Haun uh,

1485
01:28:42,710 --> 01:28:47,360
what is the best way to systematically
develop and refine your palate? And, um,

1486
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:49,970
I'll just,
I'll modify that and say what is,

1487
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:55,000
what is one simple way
to start systematically
developing and refining your

1488
01:28:55,221 --> 01:28:56,054
palette?

1489
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:59,350
Wow, that's an issue in
question. I've never, I've never,

1490
01:28:59,351 --> 01:29:01,800
I've never been asked that. I think, um,

1491
01:29:02,310 --> 01:29:07,310
I think basically just tasting everything
you possibly can and really tasting

1492
01:29:08,041 --> 01:29:09,110
it. Like, thinking about it,

1493
01:29:09,210 --> 01:29:12,570
like breaking down the flavor
and just paying attention to it.

1494
01:29:12,630 --> 01:29:15,600
I'm smelling things.
So smell is a really

1495
01:29:17,130 --> 01:29:21,420
fundamental part of tastes way more
than we realize. So I would, you know,

1496
01:29:21,421 --> 01:29:23,220
make sure you're really smelling,
touching,

1497
01:29:23,221 --> 01:29:27,320
and tasting as much as you possibly
can. Eat at restaurants, um,

1498
01:29:27,420 --> 01:29:31,710
go to farmer's markets, um, tried
things out and the more you taste like,

1499
01:29:31,711 --> 01:29:36,250
the more you'll start understanding
the subtleties and complexities. Um,

1500
01:29:36,540 --> 01:29:39,450
like, I don't know. I
don't know of a resource.

1501
01:29:39,690 --> 01:29:42,150
I mean that's just the way I learn
is like cooking and tasting things.

1502
01:29:42,151 --> 01:29:43,650
And that's the way most chefs learn.

1503
01:29:44,310 --> 01:29:48,690
I don't know of a resource that's like
a guide to palate development. Um,

1504
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:51,240
I'm sure there's something out there,
but I don't, I don't know of it.

1505
01:29:51,740 --> 01:29:53,450
Yeah, it's uh, it, this was a,

1506
01:29:53,451 --> 01:29:57,890
this was a question I
had to tackle for myself,

1507
01:29:58,190 --> 01:30:02,780
um, when I was attempting to
learn to cook in the beginning.

1508
01:30:02,810 --> 01:30:05,750
So I would s I would say to Daniel,
a couple of things really helped me.

1509
01:30:05,751 --> 01:30:09,530
The first was, uh, going to restaurants,

1510
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:12,900
going to the same restaurant,
say five days in a row.

1511
01:30:13,180 --> 01:30:17,840
Maybe you can't do five days, but going
there regularly enough on off days,

1512
01:30:17,841 --> 01:30:21,230
like Tuesday to Thursday,

1513
01:30:21,230 --> 01:30:23,330
Monday to Thursday to
get to know the staff.

1514
01:30:23,440 --> 01:30:27,770
I'm always keeping the menu with
you when you're eating so you can,

1515
01:30:27,950 --> 01:30:31,550
you can read along as you eat dishes.
So you know what's in it,

1516
01:30:31,580 --> 01:30:33,110
like the five or six,
seven ingredients,

1517
01:30:33,111 --> 01:30:36,740
whenever it might be a smelling
your food before you eat it.

1518
01:30:37,420 --> 01:30:40,520
It looks kind of weird, but it's smelling
food before you eat it. Cause I've,

1519
01:30:40,521 --> 01:30:45,330
I've always had chronic,
well up until I started using um,

1520
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:46,880
kind of Sinus rinses,

1521
01:30:46,881 --> 01:30:50,930
I had chronic sinusitis and I have
a lot of trouble smelling. Um,

1522
01:30:51,380 --> 01:30:52,490
and then,
uh,

1523
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:56,660
last thing would be for unfamiliar
ingredients that are mixed into a dish.

1524
01:30:56,780 --> 01:30:59,120
And this is part of the reason
that you would go during the week,

1525
01:30:59,150 --> 01:31:04,150
asking them to give you a little bit
on the side so that you can taste it

1526
01:31:04,611 --> 01:31:08,390
individually before you eat it in
the mix I've found and there's a,

1527
01:31:08,391 --> 01:31:10,490
there's a fun book called
the Flavor Bible also.

1528
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:11,770
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. That's good.

1529
01:31:11,860 --> 01:31:12,730
That is a cool book.

1530
01:31:12,731 --> 01:31:15,910
And a lot of chefs use that to come
up with unusual flavor combinations.

1531
01:31:16,720 --> 01:31:18,960
Next question is from ads.
Uh,

1532
01:31:19,330 --> 01:31:21,850
if you had to pack the essence
of life into a Burrito,

1533
01:31:21,880 --> 01:31:23,290
what would that burrito would be like?

1534
01:31:25,690 --> 01:31:28,520
The essence of life into
a Burrito? Yeah. Yeah.

1535
01:31:29,580 --> 01:31:33,430
Meaning like what would the ingredients
be? The food ingredients. Yeah.

1536
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:39,190
Wow. All right. Here we go. Um, okay. Uh,

1537
01:31:39,191 --> 01:31:43,300
okay. I think I would have,
you'd have, um, uh, you know,

1538
01:31:43,301 --> 01:31:48,130
you'd have some brown rice in there for
like fortitude, sustenance for like,

1539
01:31:48,570 --> 01:31:53,530
you know, your grit and
determination. Um, I would have,

1540
01:31:54,100 --> 01:31:59,020
um, avocado, lots of avocado
for like the richness,

1541
01:31:59,170 --> 01:32:03,670
life, beauty, color,
flavor, like excitement.

1542
01:32:04,150 --> 01:32:08,530
I would have, um, would be my protein.

1543
01:32:08,590 --> 01:32:12,650
I definitely have beans. Um, uh,

1544
01:32:12,660 --> 01:32:17,430
I think beans are like this, you
know, the see their growth. Uh, they,

1545
01:32:17,650 --> 01:32:22,480
they, they, they harness
promise for me. Hope Opera, you
know, Opportunity, optimism.

1546
01:32:23,080 --> 01:32:25,510
Um,
I'd have a little,

1547
01:32:25,900 --> 01:32:30,790
maybe a little skirt steak
for strength and, um,

1548
01:32:30,910 --> 01:32:32,950
but not a lot.
Um,

1549
01:32:33,670 --> 01:32:38,670
and I'd have a Habanero
salsa for like the spice,

1550
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:42,330
the excitement, uh, the, you know,

1551
01:32:42,370 --> 01:32:45,470
so the being vigorous,
uh,

1552
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:49,090
part of what makes life so amazing.
Um,

1553
01:32:49,580 --> 01:32:54,580
and then maybe I'd let the chef throw
in one other mystery ingredient,

1554
01:32:55,510 --> 01:32:59,560
uh, to stimulate curiosity,
which I think is, uh,

1555
01:32:59,590 --> 01:33:04,400
the most important or
underappreciated quality of, uh,

1556
01:33:04,401 --> 01:33:08,480
of, of people who lives great,
successful, awesome lives,

1557
01:33:08,481 --> 01:33:13,040
which is just being curious about
the world around them. So I let the,

1558
01:33:13,041 --> 01:33:17,090
I let the chef throw a mystery, a
mystery ingredient in there. How's that?

1559
01:33:17,260 --> 01:33:20,750
I love it. It looks like, looks
like my cheat day on Saturday.

1560
01:33:20,751 --> 01:33:25,370
He's going to be doing
burritos. Uh, if, uh,

1561
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:30,110
if, uh, just two more questions. Uh,
this is, this is really fun and, uh,

1562
01:33:30,610 --> 01:33:34,720
people can certainly let us know
if they want more, more. Sam,

1563
01:33:34,780 --> 01:33:38,920
I'm sure a lot of people will be the two,
two more questions for you.

1564
01:33:40,020 --> 01:33:44,800
The first is if you could give your,
let's just say,

1565
01:33:45,210 --> 01:33:49,750
uh, give yourself advice when you were
just graduating from u Chicago and what

1566
01:33:49,751 --> 01:33:51,260
advice would that be?
Okay.

1567
01:33:52,510 --> 01:33:56,540
MMM. Wow, that's a great question. Um,

1568
01:33:57,800 --> 01:34:01,400
well if I would've given myself advice
when I graduated from when I went in,

1569
01:34:01,740 --> 01:34:06,080
I would have said study a little
harder, you know, work a little harder.

1570
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:10,250
But I, when I, when I left, I
mean, I, I think the advice that I,

1571
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:15,780
um, that, uh, that I live
by, which it kind of holds,

1572
01:34:15,781 --> 01:34:20,500
which is basically get out there in the
world, be open to it, explore it, um,

1573
01:34:20,970 --> 01:34:24,040
uh, be, don't, don't,
don't worry about having a,

1574
01:34:24,100 --> 01:34:29,070
a clear plan because I didn't know
enough to have a clear plan. Um,

1575
01:34:29,130 --> 01:34:33,540
and you know, follow things that I really
cared about and, and, and go all in.

1576
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:37,470
When I, when I found some that
that interests me because passion,

1577
01:34:37,471 --> 01:34:40,710
like passions and overstated word,
I mean I think passion develops.

1578
01:34:41,190 --> 01:34:44,610
So like I was really into food
and was interested in it and,

1579
01:34:44,820 --> 01:34:48,570
and I threw myself into,
into food, but I, I,

1580
01:34:48,810 --> 01:34:52,530
it didn't become a passion so I
can, you know, really combined.

1581
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:54,600
Although I was like passionate about it,
did,

1582
01:34:54,640 --> 01:34:58,100
it wasn't a life passion until
I can like combined, you know,

1583
01:34:58,101 --> 01:35:02,750
food and nourishment with health and
sustainability and politics and policy and

1584
01:35:02,751 --> 01:35:07,130
what we're doing to really help make
sure that all people can live healthy,

1585
01:35:07,131 --> 01:35:10,400
productive, you know, awesome lives
through the food that they're eating.

1586
01:35:10,950 --> 01:35:14,150
That's what sort of became that,
that passion.

1587
01:35:14,151 --> 01:35:15,620
So I think a lot of people are like,
find your passion.

1588
01:35:15,621 --> 01:35:18,260
I think passion comes from
a combination of being open,

1589
01:35:18,261 --> 01:35:22,730
curious of really going all in
when you find something that, um,

1590
01:35:22,760 --> 01:35:26,270
that you're interested in. Um, then
then that, then that goes and I,

1591
01:35:26,271 --> 01:35:29,330
and I think always just trying to figure
out how to do the right thing, you know,

1592
01:35:29,331 --> 01:35:33,140
trying to remember why you're
doing what you're doing. Um,

1593
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:36,920
is our kind of the lessons that I've
tried to live by and, and they've,

1594
01:35:36,980 --> 01:35:38,480
they've served well on the,
you know,

1595
01:35:38,481 --> 01:35:43,481
getting out in the world gives you a
perspective on a wherever you are that I

1596
01:35:44,411 --> 01:35:48,180
found to be transformative and um,

1597
01:35:48,270 --> 01:35:53,070
and just the foundation of, of,
of who I am. So, um, it's been,

1598
01:35:53,071 --> 01:35:54,120
uh,
it's been good.

1599
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:58,580
No, I, I I really want to underscore
something you said then I think is really

1600
01:35:58,581 --> 01:36:02,720
important and that is just
related to finding your passion.

1601
01:36:02,721 --> 01:36:06,840
A lot of people ask me, how can I find my
passion? And I think that in their mind,

1602
01:36:06,841 --> 01:36:11,841
do they see this singular thing that is
this lightening bolt that knocks them

1603
01:36:11,991 --> 01:36:14,330
off their feet? And in
my case, just like you,

1604
01:36:14,660 --> 01:36:19,660
it was an unexpected combination of things
that came together by trying a lot of

1605
01:36:20,361 --> 01:36:22,460
things and being not having,
and Mike is,

1606
01:36:22,461 --> 01:36:26,270
it didn't have like a five or
10 year plan, but it was, uh,

1607
01:36:26,330 --> 01:36:30,290
I will do the best I can at this,
this next Gig, whatever that is,

1608
01:36:30,710 --> 01:36:34,030
and look for doors that open. And, uh,

1609
01:36:34,940 --> 01:36:37,850
so I don't want people to think,
to feel like,

1610
01:36:37,851 --> 01:36:41,600
and I've seen people reflect this feel
like a failure because they haven't had a

1611
01:36:41,601 --> 01:36:46,100
single activity hit them like
a cupid's Arrow or whatever.

1612
01:36:46,460 --> 01:36:51,260
Um, what if you could make one ask
of the people listening to this,

1613
01:36:51,290 --> 01:36:52,340
what would that ask be?

1614
01:36:53,340 --> 01:36:57,570
Oh, great question. Um,
what we might want to ask.

1615
01:36:57,571 --> 01:37:02,000
I think my one ask would just
be too, um, to be your engaged.

1616
01:37:02,390 --> 01:37:07,300
I think right now, uh, we're, we're
suffering from lack of engagement, uh,

1617
01:37:07,680 --> 01:37:11,240
around some of the issues that
really matter. And you know,

1618
01:37:11,241 --> 01:37:13,860
there's lots of solutions. There's
lots of different ways to think about,

1619
01:37:13,861 --> 01:37:16,670
and particularly in food, I think,
you know, there's, you know,

1620
01:37:16,671 --> 01:37:19,580
there's nothing more important than
making sure our kids are getting food.

1621
01:37:19,581 --> 01:37:23,330
I mean, we have so many hungry
kids in, in, in, in the country,

1622
01:37:23,331 --> 01:37:24,950
we're wasting so much food.

1623
01:37:24,980 --> 01:37:28,280
We're not getting enough nourishing
food and the face of climate change,

1624
01:37:28,281 --> 01:37:29,114
there's gonna be,

1625
01:37:29,540 --> 01:37:33,200
it's gonna be even harder to grow healthy
food and produce it at an affordable,

1626
01:37:33,630 --> 01:37:37,800
uh, at an affordable price for people. So
the challenges are higher and, and allow,

1627
01:37:37,801 --> 01:37:38,491
we're so,
I mean,

1628
01:37:38,491 --> 01:37:42,830
so engaging and caring and
trying to improve the food
system through the choices

1629
01:37:42,831 --> 01:37:45,560
that we're making every day.
There's a start.

1630
01:37:45,561 --> 01:37:47,250
And I think for people who
really get into, right,

1631
01:37:47,251 --> 01:37:52,080
it's starting to translate that into and
into politics and actually caring about,

1632
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:56,430
um, these issues in terms
of who's us in Washington.

1633
01:37:56,490 --> 01:38:00,690
And I think that's a, um, the
politicians follow the people,

1634
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:02,640
the end businesses follow the people.

1635
01:38:02,730 --> 01:38:07,590
Like they try to like shape decisions
and they market it, etc. But in the end,

1636
01:38:07,591 --> 01:38:10,200
they're following.
And so we need to lead.

1637
01:38:10,201 --> 01:38:13,740
And then we're leading every single day
in ways that sometimes we're aware of

1638
01:38:13,741 --> 01:38:15,090
and sometimes we're not.

1639
01:38:15,180 --> 01:38:19,470
And so I think that kind of awareness
and engagement can have a profound impact

1640
01:38:19,471 --> 01:38:22,590
on what companies are producing
and what policies are being made.

1641
01:38:22,591 --> 01:38:27,150
So I think that's my big ask,
at least in my, in my world.

1642
01:38:27,151 --> 01:38:30,540
But the truth is that that kind of same,
uh,

1643
01:38:30,570 --> 01:38:34,470
same principle applies to
just about any issue. Um,

1644
01:38:34,590 --> 01:38:37,850
and I think we just,
the more were engaged,

1645
01:38:37,930 --> 01:38:42,520
the, the, the more democracy
works. Agreed. Yeah.

1646
01:38:42,550 --> 01:38:45,110
Give a damn people, there'll
be apathetic, finds fun,

1647
01:38:45,150 --> 01:38:49,480
something to get excited
about and care about. Uh, Sam,

1648
01:38:49,750 --> 01:38:54,240
where can people find you on the Internet?

Facebook. To be honest with
you, I said that up so long ago.

1654
01:39:08,601 --> 01:39:10,670
I didn't even know what my name is.
I have to look that up.

1655
01:39:11,900 --> 01:39:14,780
I got to get home that den
and the master of this.

1656
01:39:14,940 --> 01:39:19,080
Oh, wow. You know, I'm fumbling
my way through all the, uh,

1657
01:39:19,170 --> 01:39:23,400
all of the interwebs one day at a time.
I do have a website where people can,

1658
01:39:23,460 --> 01:39:27,720
can also check you out. Um, no, not
yet. That is in the works in process.

1659
01:39:27,721 --> 01:39:29,460
We'll process.
I will,

1660
01:39:29,461 --> 01:39:33,540
I will share that with people when it
is ready for fruits for its big debut.

1661
01:39:33,950 --> 01:39:37,980
Uh, Sam, well this is, this is
great. I really enjoy hanging out.

1662
01:39:37,981 --> 01:39:40,360

1670
01:40:02,750 --> 01:40:06,250
Hey man, thanks buddy. I'll talk to
you soon. All right, take care. Bye.

1671
01:40:12,010 --> 01:40:16,150
This episode is brought to you by 99
designs your one stop shop for all things

1672
01:40:16,151 --> 01:40:17,710
graphic design related.

1673
01:40:17,740 --> 01:40:22,720
I've used 99 designs for everything
from banner ads to book covers,

1674
01:40:22,721 --> 01:40:26,440
including sketches and mock ups
that led to the four hour body,

1675
01:40:26,441 --> 01:40:30,430
which later became number one New York
Times Number One Wall Street Journal and

1676
01:40:30,431 --> 01:40:31,264
the brainstorming.

1677
01:40:31,280 --> 01:40:34,600
A lot of it took place with designers
from around the world and here's how it

1678
01:40:34,601 --> 01:40:38,770
works. Whether you need a t
shirt, a business card, a website,

1679
01:40:39,070 --> 01:40:41,350
an APP thumbnail,
whatever it might be,

1680
01:40:41,590 --> 01:40:45,070
you submit that project and
designers from around the world.

1681
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:47,710
We'll send you sketches
and mock ups and designs.

1682
01:40:47,980 --> 01:40:51,430
You choose your favorite and you have an
original that you love or you get your

1683
01:40:51,431 --> 01:40:52,090
money back.

1684
01:40:52,090 --> 01:40:55,870
It's that straightforward and many of you
who are listening have already used it

1685
01:40:55,871 --> 01:40:58,330
and created some amazing things
that I'll be sharing in the future.

1686
01:40:58,600 --> 01:41:00,970
But in the meantime, if you want
to see some of my competitions,

This podcast is brought
to you by Mizzen and main.

1691
01:41:16,630 --> 01:41:19,120
Don't worry about the spelling.
All you need to do is this.

1692
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:24,310
I have organized my entire life around
avoiding fancy shirts because you have to

1693
01:41:24,311 --> 01:41:28,570
iron them. You sweat through
them, they smell really easily.

1694
01:41:28,571 --> 01:41:29,710
They're a pain in the ass.

1695
01:41:30,040 --> 01:41:34,120
Mizzen and main has given me
the only shirt that I need.

1696
01:41:34,121 --> 01:41:37,060
And what I mean by that and Kelly
Starr at loves the shirts as well,

1697
01:41:37,450 --> 01:41:39,340
is that you can trick people.

1698
01:41:39,370 --> 01:41:43,060
They look really fancy so you can take
them out to nice dinners, whatever,

1699
01:41:43,450 --> 01:41:46,240
but they're made from athletics,
sweat wicking material.

1700
01:41:46,270 --> 01:41:50,200
So you can throw this thing into your
luggage in a heap or on your kitchen table

1701
01:41:50,201 --> 01:41:54,970
like I did recently and then pull it out,
throw it on with no irony, no steaming,

1702
01:41:54,971 --> 01:41:59,140
no nothing. Walk out and
you could probably wear this
thing for a week straight,

1703
01:41:59,200 --> 01:42:03,430
or make it your only dress shirt and
take it on trips for weeks at a time.

1704
01:42:03,700 --> 01:42:06,550
Never wash it. It will not smell.
You will not sweat through it.

1705
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:09,370
You got to check these things out.
So go to four hour work,

1706
01:42:09,371 --> 01:42:13,240
week.com all spelled out for our work,
week.com forward slash shirts,

1707
01:42:13,270 --> 01:42:14,430
check it out,
four hour work,

1708
01:42:14,431 --> 01:42:18,460
week.com forward slash shirts and
you'll see some of my favorite gear,

1709
01:42:18,670 --> 01:42:22,330
including the one shirt that I've been
traveling with. And until next time,

1710
01:42:22,750 --> 01:42:23,590
thank you for listening.

1711
01:42:43,860 --> 01:42:44,693
Okay.

1712
01:42:54,300 --> 01:42:58,710
Okay.
Okay.

1713
01:42:59,790 --> 01:42:59,850
Yeah.
