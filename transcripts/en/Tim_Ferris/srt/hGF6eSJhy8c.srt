1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,200
Brian sound test.
What do you have for breakfast?

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:07,380
I had an Omelet and I'll know what
was in the outlet. Peppers, onions,

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:11,440
onions, onions, peppers,
tomatoes with no meat.

4
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:16,870
I love how you reordered those
ingredients. The mind of Brian at work.

5
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:19,850
Optimal.
At this altitude,

6
00:00:19,851 --> 00:00:23,030
I can run flat out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking.

7
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,500
I'm a cybernetic organism
living this year.

8
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,620
This episode is brought to you by
Athletic Greens. I get asked all the time,

9
00:00:44,621 --> 00:00:46,810
if you could only use one supplement,
what would it be?

10
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:49,720
And my answer is
inevitably Athletic Greens,

11
00:00:49,721 --> 00:00:52,210
it is your all in one
nutritional insurance.

12
00:00:52,211 --> 00:00:53,950
I recommended it in the four hour body,

13
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:57,970
did not get paid for that and I
travel with it to avoid getting sick.

14
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:00,970
I take it in the mornings to
ensure optimal performance.

15
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:02,470
It just covers all my basis.

16
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,460
If I can't get what I need through whole
food meals throughout the rest of the

17
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:11,320
day, and you can get 50 oh my
God, 50% off. Yes, 50% off.

18
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:16,350
If you go to athleticgreens.com forward

forward slash. Tim, check it out.

20
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:24,520
It's tasty but more important it will
help you not screw up when you're doing

21
00:01:24,521 --> 00:01:26,920
your nutritional plannings.
So for me it just covers the basis,

22
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:31,720
takes a load off my mind,
puts a lot in my body and check it out.

this episode is brought to you by 99
designs your one stop shop for all things

25
00:01:40,371 --> 00:01:41,960
graphic design related.

26
00:01:41,961 --> 00:01:46,940
I've used 99 designs for everything
from banner ads to book covers,

27
00:01:46,941 --> 00:01:50,660
including sketches and mock ups
that led to the four hour body,

28
00:01:50,661 --> 00:01:54,620
which later became number one New York
Times Number One Wall Street Journal and

29
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,860
the brainstorming and a lot of it took
place with designers from around the

30
00:01:57,861 --> 00:02:02,060
world. And here's how it works. Whether
you need a t shirt, a business card,

31
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:05,570
a website and APP thumbnail,
whatever it might be,

32
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:09,320
you submit that project and
designers from around the world.

33
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,930
We'll send you sketches
and mock ups and designs.

34
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:15,620
You choose your favorite and you have an
original that you love or you get your

35
00:02:15,621 --> 00:02:17,330
money back.
It's that straight forward.

36
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:21,050
And many of you who are listening have
already used it and created some amazing

37
00:02:21,051 --> 00:02:23,420
things that I'll be sharing it in
the future. But in the meantime,

38
00:02:23,421 --> 00:02:25,190
if you want to see some

41
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:41,390
Hello midnight mad hatter's.
This is Tim Ferriss.

42
00:02:41,391 --> 00:02:46,391
It's very late and I am sing songs in my
intro to you in a sultry voice because

43
00:02:47,871 --> 00:02:50,510
there are people sleeping in my house
and I don't want to wake them up,

44
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:55,870
but I had to record this intro because
I want to get this episode to a s a p.

45
00:02:56,121 --> 00:02:57,110
It is a really fun one.

46
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:00,850
For those of you who are joining
the Tim show for the first time,

47
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:05,740
don't take my lack of
seriousness for lack of content.

48
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:09,250
We have a very important
mission here on the program,

49
00:03:09,251 --> 00:03:11,740
which is to deconstruct
world class performers,

50
00:03:11,741 --> 00:03:16,450
to interview people like billionaire
investors, just prodigies,

51
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:20,800
actors like Arnold Swartz and anger and
so on and so forth and everything in

52
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:25,270
between. We have athletes,
we have memory champions,

53
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:30,480
and there are commonalities across all
of these different disciplines and my job

54
00:03:30,491 --> 00:03:34,570
is to tease out the beliefs,
the routines, the rituals,

55
00:03:34,571 --> 00:03:38,800
the favorite books, all of the tidbits
that you can apply in your own life.

56
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,340
And this episode is no exception.
Had a blast with this.

57
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:47,370
My guest was a friend and very
impressive entrepreneur and investor,

58
00:03:47,951 --> 00:03:52,870
Brian Johnson. That's Bryan with a
y. He is the founder of Ostp Fund,

59
00:03:52,871 --> 00:03:55,090
which I'll explain in a
second and brain tree.

60
00:03:55,180 --> 00:04:00,180
He sold the ladder to Ebay in
2013 four 800 million in cash.

61
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:06,090
Now that is more than enough to retire
and kickback and a hammock and lather

62
00:04:06,851 --> 00:04:08,800
yourself with coconut butter
for the rest of your life,

63
00:04:08,801 --> 00:04:11,530
but he is not one to rest on his laurels.

64
00:04:11,531 --> 00:04:16,531
He took the Elon Musk approach and took
$100 million of his personal capital to

65
00:04:17,441 --> 00:04:20,110
launch the OSTP fund that was in 2004.

66
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:25,330
And the entire fund is intended to
support crazy inventors and scientists who

67
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:29,320
aimed to benefit humanity by rewriting
the operating systems of life.

68
00:04:29,321 --> 00:04:32,170
And in this interview,
it will explain what that means,

69
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:36,460
but it is going to stretch
you to think very, very big,

70
00:04:36,461 --> 00:04:39,760
hopefully much bigger than you
thought possible for yourself.

71
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,920
So if his investments to give you an idea,

72
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:46,480
include endeavors to cure age related
diseases and radically extend human

73
00:04:46,481 --> 00:04:50,890
lifespan to 100 plus human longevity inc.
And we talk about this in this episode,

74
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:55,000
making a biology,
a predictable programming language.

75
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:58,480
So how can you program Dna,
uh,

76
00:04:58,481 --> 00:05:00,100
and biology to produce what you want?

77
00:05:00,101 --> 00:05:02,830
Like Ginkgo bioworks and
synthetic genomics, uh,

78
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:07,300
replicate the human visual cortex using
artificial intelligence companies,

79
00:05:07,301 --> 00:05:09,160
vicarious mine,

80
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:14,290
precious resources off of asteroids
with companies, planetary resources,

81
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:15,580
and many others.

82
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:20,700
So Brian is not only a
scrappy rags to riches story,

83
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,410
but he is someone who,

84
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:28,590
who succeeded and had a massive success
story in a technical field without

85
00:05:30,221 --> 00:05:35,170
technical training and also just
a very deep, soulful good guy.

86
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,100
And all of those things combined
make for a fun conversation.

87
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:42,100
I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
And without further ado,

88
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,810
please meet Brian Johnson.

89
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,920
Brian, welcome to the show.
Hi Tim. Thanks for having me.

90
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:54,070
And this is,
this is our take two.

91
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:58,010
We had a rough auditions start.
We were sitting in a park

92
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:01,910
and we had this guy fooling around in
the bushes who then asked us if we had a

93
00:06:01,911 --> 00:06:04,310
spare backpack. I thought
that was an odd request. Yeah,

94
00:06:04,311 --> 00:06:05,740
I think we are missing something.
He,

95
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:10,730
I don't think I was the real request
and we did not have a spare backpack.

96
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:14,570
Uh, but we, we were put sufficiently on
edge by this guy in meandering around us,

97
00:06:14,571 --> 00:06:18,700
like doing concentric circles, like a
shark around somebody in a lifeboat.

98
00:06:18,701 --> 00:06:23,440
Then I decided it was better to do it
inside. So we're at Casa Ferris and, uh,

99
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:28,130
I want to look at this and
kind of a medical context
because I've been hoping to

100
00:06:28,131 --> 00:06:29,360
have you on the podcast for so long.

101
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,310
And we were talking just before starting
recording about what questions I might

102
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,500
ask and giving you sort of an overview.

103
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,310
And I had no idea that
you'd done any prep,

104
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:43,640
but I wanted you to tell me a little
bit about it because you asked,

105
00:06:43,641 --> 00:06:45,230
how can we make this a
home run? And I said, well,

106
00:06:45,231 --> 00:06:48,200
I think we will want to focus on stories.
And uh,

107
00:06:48,201 --> 00:06:52,850
I will also typically judge it by how
many notes people take. And you're like,

108
00:06:52,851 --> 00:06:54,140
well, that's really interesting.
You should say that.

109
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:55,580
So maybe you could talk about,

110
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,090
since we first discussed
doing the podcast together,

111
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:03,200
how you've been thinking about it.
Yes, I guess I, I love efficiency.

112
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,700
And so as I contemplate if I'm going to
spend 60 minutes of my time listening to

113
00:07:07,701 --> 00:07:12,020
something, I want some value.
And so specifically I want
to have, you know, five,

114
00:07:12,021 --> 00:07:14,780
six, seven takeaways. And
so I thought ahead of time,

115
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:18,590
what could I do in the shortest amount
of time that would create the most value

116
00:07:18,591 --> 00:07:21,860
in someone's life. And, uh, so I think I,

117
00:07:21,861 --> 00:07:24,710
this made me very excited because I
wanted to have you on, first of all,

118
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:26,720
but second of all,
you'd thought about it very methodically,

119
00:07:26,721 --> 00:07:29,960
which shouldn't have surprised
me at all. Uh, we've,

120
00:07:29,961 --> 00:07:32,270
we've taken a lot of hikes together
and had a lot of long talks,

121
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:35,810
very wide ranging, and I think we'll
get into a good amount of it. Uh,

122
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,490
let's start kind of at the
beginning and, uh, we'll,

123
00:07:40,491 --> 00:07:43,670
we'll bounce around sort of memento
style throughout your life I think.

124
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:47,510
But what are some of your earliest,

125
00:07:47,511 --> 00:07:52,340
most formative memories
from your childhood? So I,

126
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:56,400
my family and I, we were
really close. Um, I have four,

127
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:01,340
three brothers and one sister
and we were always up to no good.

128
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:05,930
We live in a small town in Utah and we
had nothing really to do but get into

129
00:08:05,931 --> 00:08:09,120
trouble. But we're also very close
when we were best friends, um,

130
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:12,620
it was through truth, through a high
school, for example. Most that, you know,

131
00:08:12,621 --> 00:08:15,800
when people are in high school, they
don't like their parents will shun them.

132
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,611
They're embarrassed by them.

133
00:08:16,611 --> 00:08:20,390
But I would walk down the hallways with
my arm around my mom and she'd give high

134
00:08:20,391 --> 00:08:22,760
fives to my friends cause she was there
if, you know, being a substitute teacher,

135
00:08:22,761 --> 00:08:25,090
watching over her rambunctious boys.
But um,

136
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,490
we had a great time as a family and um,

137
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:30,500
for fun we would watch the Dukes
of hazard and the a team, uh,

138
00:08:30,501 --> 00:08:34,110
on Friday nights and we'd go get
a special combo meal at Hardee's.

139
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,220
We didn't really have much
money, but we just, uh,

140
00:08:36,221 --> 00:08:38,670
I guess I have a lot of sweet memories
from growing up to being close to the

141
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:42,290
family. And what it sounds like
your mom was one of the cool moms.

142
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:45,890
What do you think, I correct me
if I'm wrong, but I mean what,

143
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:51,400
what characteristics of hers or habits
of hers or otherwise enabled her to be

144
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,220
the cool mom and not the shunned

145
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,260
mom? You know, what, what were the
contributing factors? All right.

146
00:08:58,261 --> 00:09:02,490
So one time I wondered what
if you filled a gallon,

147
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:06,030
a milk gallon jug full of
gasoline and you lit it on fire.

148
00:09:06,031 --> 00:09:08,580
I wondered what would happen.
And so I went out into the street,

149
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,430
and this is just in front of
your house or, yeah, exactly.

150
00:09:11,431 --> 00:09:14,200
I took the gasoline that was otherwise
used for the lawnmower and I filled out

151
00:09:14,201 --> 00:09:17,730
this carton and I went out on
the street and I lit it on fire.

152
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,590
And as expected,
you know,

153
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:23,460
it was producing quite a flame and
then her green Taurus rolled around the

154
00:09:23,461 --> 00:09:26,760
corner down coming down the street
coming home. And I thought, oh no.

155
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:32,190
So in haste I kicked over the jug and
now the gasoline spills on the street and

156
00:09:32,191 --> 00:09:36,690
into the gutter and now it's rolling down
the gutter. Uh, and there's cars there.

157
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:39,860
So I'm having these images of
like cars blowing up, right?

158
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,540
So I walk them to the gutter and I
stomp on the gasoline to put it out.

159
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,700
And of course that splashes.
Now the lawns on fires,

160
00:09:44,701 --> 00:09:47,670
like it's getting worse and worse.
So anyways,

161
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:51,750
we put the fire out and then the only
thing she says to me, she says, Brian,

162
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:56,640
you probably shouldn't do that
again. And I said, all right. That's,

163
00:09:56,641 --> 00:10:00,990
that's fair. That's a very,
that's typical. My mom, she
was a supportive and kind.

164
00:10:00,991 --> 00:10:03,390
She kept us out of trouble the best
she could, but she wasn't over the top.

165
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:07,950
And we responded to that. Do you, so
do you think it was a very Dalai Lama,

166
00:10:07,951 --> 00:10:12,660
like response to potential gasoline
bomb? Uh, do you think, uh,

167
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:16,610
you know, from the time that I lit the
Dalai Lama's loan on fire, I can say, ah,

168
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:19,590
I'm kidding. That's not what
I did. But the, the, uh,

169
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,680
do you think then that that kind of
moderation in discipline prevented the

170
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:28,470
rebelliousness that you would otherwise
see? Or do you think that it was,

171
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:33,390
that she was closer to you guys in some
way that then other parents were to

172
00:10:33,391 --> 00:10:34,224
their kids?

173
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:39,500
We trusted her implicitly and I think
when she let go and we owned ourselves and

174
00:10:39,901 --> 00:10:42,030
our own behavior,
I think we behaved accordingly.

175
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,970
And so I did feel responsible for
my own behavior and it didn't,

176
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,340
I was still just as mischievous,

177
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:51,150
but I also knew there were boundaries
and how mischievous I could be and it was

178
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:55,020
out of respect for her and that she did
give us a lot of freedom to do what we

179
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:57,000
wanted to do.
Did you ever get in,

180
00:10:57,001 --> 00:11:02,001
did you get in trouble at school or not
so much so I successfully avoided really

181
00:11:02,551 --> 00:11:04,470
serious trouble my whole life, but, uh,

182
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:08,160
just below the level that I think
could have been a really dangerous,

183
00:11:08,161 --> 00:11:10,830
but we did all sorts of things.
And um,

184
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:13,950
even now I guess as I look at
my children as they grow up,

185
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,150
the world has been sterilized dramatically
in terms of what is and is not

186
00:11:18,151 --> 00:11:19,710
acceptable behavior.
Um,

187
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,280
in many ways I'm grateful for the things
we were able to do because we able to

188
00:11:23,281 --> 00:11:27,810
explore and try new things out. But um,
yeah, I stayed out of trouble mostly.

189
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:32,520
Did you collect anything as good
a baseball cards? Baseball cards.

190
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:36,060
How long did you collect
baseball cards for? Seven years.

191
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:38,760
I remember going down to the store
and buying the tops, you know,

192
00:11:38,761 --> 00:11:41,520
25 cards for a dollar 25 and was it,

193
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:46,500
was it mostly an obsession for you
as a baseball fan? Was it a business?

194
00:11:46,501 --> 00:11:49,170
Was it a combination of that and more?

195
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,980
I just loved having it and
knowing that I had value,

196
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,590
some rare card to show to friends
when they came over. But no,

197
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:59,470
it was just simply a way to splurge.
I didn't like spending money very much,

198
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,110
but that was the only thing
I've really spent money on. Uh,

199
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:07,450
were you a popular kid in grade school?
High School?

200
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,930
No. So, well, so in eighth grade

201
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,650
I remember I had these good
friends in my neighborhood.

202
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:19,390
We were best buddies and I was annoyed
because in school there were these

203
00:12:19,391 --> 00:12:22,690
cliques forming of Jackson's donors
and nerds like these typical things,

204
00:12:22,691 --> 00:12:23,770
how people organize themselves.

205
00:12:23,771 --> 00:12:27,520
And they had these ingroup characteristics
where they would conform with each

206
00:12:27,521 --> 00:12:29,350
other's behaviors and say similar things.

207
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:32,350
And I was bothered because I
wanted to be friends with everyone.

208
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:37,450
And so I did this like scrappy big
data analysis where I went out and I

209
00:12:37,451 --> 00:12:40,810
evaluated all the different groups and
the power structures within each groups

210
00:12:40,811 --> 00:12:43,930
because there's always people within the
group to allow new members to join the

211
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:47,470
group. Sort of the alpha.
Exactly. Border Guard. Yes.

212
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,450
And so I would befriend these
people and I would say like, I'm,

213
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:53,440
I come in peace and I just want to
be friends. I have no agenda here.

214
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:58,000
And I became friends. I think honestly
with everyone in the whole school.

215
00:12:58,001 --> 00:13:01,600
I just loved having friends and I love
to dance in between the different groups

216
00:13:01,601 --> 00:13:05,230
because they saw the world so differently,
right. There wasn't just like this,

217
00:13:05,231 --> 00:13:09,830
this mono, um, understanding
the world. And so, um,

218
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:13,930
I really enjoyed maintaining friendships
and that was my first experience in and

219
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,750
learning like social dynamics
because it wasn't natural for me.

220
00:13:16,751 --> 00:13:20,510
I wasn't good looking, I
didn't have expensive clothes.
My parents, we actually,

221
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:23,620
we had very little money. I
wasn't funny, I wasn't witty.

222
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,300
I wasn't necessarily super smart.

223
00:13:25,301 --> 00:13:28,360
So I didn't have the natural things
that gets you entrance into that kind of

224
00:13:28,361 --> 00:13:32,110
club. And did, did your analysis,

225
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,730
when you're looking at
say the power structure,

226
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:38,830
when you went and interacted with the,
whoever it was, the rockers, the stoners,

227
00:13:38,831 --> 00:13:40,180
the skaters, yeah, in the blank,

228
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:44,710
did you take on sort of
the characteristics of that
group or did you have a,

229
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,113
uh,

230
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:50,830
did you have a base sort of personality
instead of behaviors that went,

231
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:53,800
that traveled across the groups?
I just took an interest in them.

232
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,300
I want it to understand how they look
to the world, what they experienced,

233
00:13:57,301 --> 00:14:00,930
what they liked, what they disliked.
I just was, um, sincere and I've,

234
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:04,270
I've always been curious. And so I
know I didn't try to become like them.

235
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:07,900
I just wanted to be friends
and understand them. Did you

236
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:12,130
think of yourself or, let
me rephrase that. When,

237
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,730
when did you first start thinking
of yourself as an entrepreneur?

238
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:22,070
Um, I think when I, when I kit light,

239
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:25,540
well I guess I lived in Ecuador for
two years and I came home to the,

240
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,830
to the states. And, uh,

241
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:32,020
I guess this is probably not the
answer you're looking for, but I,

242
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:36,850
after living in Ecuador and seeing these
people shackled and extreme poverty and

243
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,240
seeing that they really
didn't have a shot at life,

244
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,760
I came home with this burning desire
that I wanted to spend my life improving,

245
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:45,010
improving people's lives.

246
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:48,370
And so I assessed what I could do is
I looked at all the things you find in

247
00:14:48,371 --> 00:14:48,761
college,

248
00:14:48,761 --> 00:14:53,690
like model Un and helping do our
projects in Africa or wherever else.

249
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,150
But nothing really spoke to me.
And so I thought, you know what?

250
00:14:56,151 --> 00:14:59,120
I'll just become an entrepreneur.
I'll build a successful business.

251
00:14:59,121 --> 00:15:03,200
I'll retire by 30 with the abundance
of resources and I'll have a freedom of

252
00:15:03,201 --> 00:15:06,860
time. And then I'll figure out
a way to improve people's lives.

253
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,180
And so I think it really,

254
00:15:08,181 --> 00:15:11,810
at the age of 21 was the first time I
set my sights really on that I can become

255
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:15,380
an entrepreneur and build something of
value. What gave you that confidence?

256
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:18,740
So I assessed my skills,

257
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,200
what I was really good at and
I couldn't really find much.

258
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:23,510
This is when you were at 21 or
was it before that? Okay. Well,

259
00:15:23,511 --> 00:15:27,380
because I wasn't good at necessarily
great at school or science or biology,

260
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:32,180
I didn't really have any skills in of
note. And so I figured, you know, I,

261
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,920
what I do have is I'm persistent,

262
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:38,120
I'm determined and I'm smart enough
that I can figure stuff out on the fly.

263
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,590
And so entrepreneurship seems like a good
path for me. And then what was, so you,

264
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:46,970
so you've decided on the, on the, on
the report card, the skill assessment,

265
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:50,510
the self audit of life, you're
like, okay, persistence check. Yeah.

266
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:55,200
Good on tap dancing with
uh, with uncertainty. Yeah.

267
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:58,460
Check box number two. Uh,
where did you go from there?

268
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,960
So I,
I was trying to find a,

269
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:05,180
a cell phone and I was really frugal.

270
00:16:05,181 --> 00:16:07,760
I've always been very frugal and I
found this guy in the yellow pages.

271
00:16:07,761 --> 00:16:10,730
I met him at the mall and I bought a cell
phone, those super cheap and he said,

272
00:16:10,731 --> 00:16:12,740
hey,
you look like you're smart and energetic.

273
00:16:12,741 --> 00:16:15,860
Why don't you come sell phones for me?
I'll pay you 40 bucks per activation.

274
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,380
And I thought, perfect. Like I'd never,

275
00:16:18,381 --> 00:16:21,950
I never understood this whole idea that
I would trade 60 minutes of my time for

276
00:16:21,951 --> 00:16:25,730
$8 and 25 cents an hour. I seemed crazy
to me. And so he'd said that to me.

277
00:16:25,731 --> 00:16:30,140
I thought, okay, I'll make 80
bucks an hour. I can do two
per hour. And I said, deal.

278
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:34,100
So I sold phones for him for two days and
then I was on the porch of this lady's

279
00:16:34,101 --> 00:16:38,960
house and she had screamed two
screaming kids. And I had this thought,

280
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:41,420
I thought, wait a second, if
I'm selling phones for him,

281
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:45,650
why can't other cell phones for me?
And I left the sale.

282
00:16:45,651 --> 00:16:49,910
I ran home and I spent almost two
solid days figuring out how to become a

283
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,740
wholesale provider of cell phone service.

284
00:16:51,741 --> 00:16:54,110
And I figured it out and I
started a company and now I,

285
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:57,800
I changed the commission structure.
So now he's making $300 per activation.

286
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:01,160
And there was a first company I started
and I hired college students to sell

287
00:17:01,161 --> 00:17:03,410
phones for me and I paid my
way through college doing that.

288
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:06,710
And when you were first selling to people,

289
00:17:06,711 --> 00:17:08,450
like this woman with the
kid screaming on the porch,

290
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:13,730
was that like I door knock type of sales
approach or how are you no kidding,

291
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:18,050
the knock, knock and wipe the feet
on the doormat like I what was,

292
00:17:18,051 --> 00:17:21,170
what was the opening, what was the opening
line when somebody opened the door?

293
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:24,110
While I was ab testing
the different approaches,

294
00:17:24,111 --> 00:17:28,010
I could walk throughout campus and ask
students, I could walk door to door.

295
00:17:28,011 --> 00:17:31,100
So this was my second day and this was
the data test going up and down the

296
00:17:31,101 --> 00:17:34,400
street. So yeah, it was do
you have a cell phone service?

297
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:37,780
And if you don't then I've
got a plan for you. Yeah,

298
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:43,550
so one of the, uh, one of my
very close friends, um, uh,

299
00:17:43,551 --> 00:17:47,660
fantastic systems engineer I started
working with when I graduated from college

300
00:17:47,661 --> 00:17:51,210
and went to mass data
storage startup mass.

301
00:17:51,211 --> 00:17:54,050
At that point it was like five
terabytes, 10 terabytes. Big Deal, right?

302
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,030
Big storage area, network
installation at the time. Uh,

303
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:00,870
he was so effective as a systems engineer
because he had to do integration,

304
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:04,620
but he started off as a door to
door encyclopedia salesperson.

305
00:18:04,621 --> 00:18:07,260
That was his first entrepreneurial gig.
So he had to get really,

306
00:18:07,261 --> 00:18:12,261
really good at overcoming objections
and interacting with people socially,

307
00:18:14,341 --> 00:18:19,080
even though he is his sort of
bedrock skill set was technical. Uh,

308
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:23,220
now did you, so let's see, you have the
cell phones. That was your first business.

309
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:26,370
Uh,
what happened between there,

310
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:30,000
and this is obviously a very large,
uh, we're maybe not so large,

311
00:18:30,001 --> 00:18:32,350
but it's a lot happen,
I'm sure between that and Braintree.

312
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,120
But what was the sort of
montage version of that? Well,

313
00:18:36,121 --> 00:18:39,870
the short version is the cell
phone company went remarkably well,

314
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:43,140
but it was not going to make me
enough money to retire by 30. Right.

315
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:44,220
So I had to find something bigger.

316
00:18:44,221 --> 00:18:48,930
So I started a voice over Ip company with
three founders and it was just before

317
00:18:48,931 --> 00:18:52,590
Skype and Vonage. And the short of that
is we had the wrong team. Wrong product,

318
00:18:52,591 --> 00:18:56,460
wrong timing. We did, we didn't, sounds
perfect. We did everything wrong now.

319
00:18:56,461 --> 00:18:58,230
But we did have a problem.
We actually built something.

320
00:18:58,231 --> 00:19:02,140
We got customers and this was also in
Utah? Yes. Yeah. And we had revenue side.

321
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,930
We actually built something,

322
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:07,830
but in reality that we were not
set up to succeed. So that felt,

323
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:10,470
and then on the heels of that I started,

324
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,660
I joined another guy to do
real estate development.

325
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,890
And the short of that is we that failed
because of some bad decisions we made.

326
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:21,270
And so without income for
two years I was dead broke.

327
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,320
And so I applied for 60 jobs and found
a monster and the other job sites at the

328
00:19:25,321 --> 00:19:29,340
time, nobody would hire me. Like it was
just, I think it was so clear that I was,

329
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:31,740
I had no intention of staying a long time.

330
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,410
I tried to make the resume look like it,
but just never was the case.

331
00:19:34,411 --> 00:19:37,470
So now nobody would even
give him an interview and
then write additional skills,

332
00:19:37,471 --> 00:19:42,090
loyalty, fierce loyalty to your
employer. Um, and then I read,

333
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,500
I saw the newspaper one day,

334
00:19:43,501 --> 00:19:46,860
I had a list of the 50 richest
people in Utah and I thought, Bingo,

335
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:51,690
that's what it is. I will write an email
to these 50 people. I'll say I'm young,

336
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,010
I'm smart.
I,

337
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:56,850
I'm trying to become an entrepreneur by
just need some money on the side so I'll

338
00:19:56,851 --> 00:19:58,680
be coming right hand, man, I'll
do whatever you want me to do.

339
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:03,460
And no one responded. It's at this point
I'm like totally desperate. I'm sure you,

340
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:06,570
I'm sure you get a fair amount
of those emails these days. I do.

341
00:20:06,571 --> 00:20:09,600
And I'm empathetic to it.
Yeah, I totally am. Um,

342
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,290
so at this point I have no income.

343
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,930
I have a child at home and
so I need to make ends meet.

344
00:20:15,931 --> 00:20:20,040
And so I find this job posting in again,
I think it's monster.

345
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:24,630
It was selling credit card processing
door to door and basically it was like if

346
00:20:24,631 --> 00:20:27,840
you go business to business, yes. Yeah.
Like marching up and down the street,

347
00:20:27,841 --> 00:20:31,290
walking into a retailer or restaurant.
Let me help you set up a merchant account.

348
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,980
Yes. Or get a point of sale
system. Yes. Or mostly change.

349
00:20:34,981 --> 00:20:38,520
Everyone already had existing
service. Got It. Got It. And so I,

350
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:42,120
the requirement was like if you could fog
a mirror, you can work for these guys.

351
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,990
It's a hundred percent commission.
Like what?

352
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:48,070
They don't care if you
don't succeed. Right. But

353
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:52,450
to your point on the sell side, um,
I would go to inside of business,

354
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:55,120
I figured out pretty quickly the
industry was really messed up.

355
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:57,980
Like a technology was terrible and um,

356
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:01,990
people were just generally plagued
by the industry because it's just

357
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:05,770
unscrupulous all this dishonesty
and complexity. As I figured out,

358
00:21:05,771 --> 00:21:08,950
that was the hook because my
product had zero differentiation.

359
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:12,700
It was exactly the same as
500 other providers that
walked in the door, you know,

360
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:17,690
every day. Right. And so I'd walk in, I'd
say, all right, Tim, you saw me walk into,

361
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,710
you'd be like, all right, sales
guy. All right. And not interested.

362
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,390
I've got stuff to do. Then when you
heard me say credit card processing,

363
00:21:22,391 --> 00:21:27,100
it's like, please leave strike too.
Yeah, like leave. So I would say, Tim,

364
00:21:27,101 --> 00:21:29,140
if you give me three minutes of your time,

365
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:32,410
I will give you $100 if you don't
say yes to using my service.

366
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:35,050
And usually they'd say like,
okay, that's interesting.

367
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,340
Like what does this guy have to offer?

368
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:38,730
And I would open my pitch book and I'd
walked him through the industry here,

369
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:41,590
the providers, here's what to do, here's
what they do it, here's what I do.

370
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:44,530
I'm the same as everyone else
except with me. You get, you know,

371
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:46,810
honesty and transparency
and great customer support.

372
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:49,990
And so I became this company's
number one salesperson.

373
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:53,200
I broke all their sales records falling
this really simple formula of just

374
00:21:53,201 --> 00:21:57,670
selling honesty and transparency and a
broken industry. That's super interesting.

375
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:01,780
And uh, so a couple of questions.
I just want to rewind for a second.

376
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:06,750
With the real estate company, what were,
if you're comfortable talking about them,

377
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,280
like what were the bad decision? What
were the worst decisions? What were the,

378
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:12,820
the fatal mistakes? So I'm really
proud of actually of what we did.

379
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:16,910
We launched a $50 million mixed juice
project in one of the best places in Utah.

380
00:22:16,911 --> 00:22:19,390
Makes to use means residential
plus commercial. Exactly. Yup.

381
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:22,990
Bottom floor of the small
shops and Fannie Mae came in.

382
00:22:22,991 --> 00:22:27,010
They were our equity investor.
We really put together a great project.

383
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:30,610
The single biggest flaw was storage space.

384
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,410
So empty nesters showed up to buy and
there wasn't sufficient storage and

385
00:22:35,411 --> 00:22:38,770
storage for just all of their extra stuff
that they want it to take out of the

386
00:22:38,771 --> 00:22:42,130
big house and move into exactly
this community living space.

387
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,850
So then sells stalled and phase one,
the bank got anxious,

388
00:22:45,851 --> 00:22:49,590
so got it. So just didn't account
for that. Yeah, that need,

389
00:22:49,591 --> 00:22:53,980
that was the big blunder,
uh, with the sales.

390
00:22:53,981 --> 00:22:58,030
So I'm fascinated by sales because there's
the, the good, the bad and the ugly.

391
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:01,690
And you often see it within
one industry. Right. And, uh,

392
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:06,650
so this brings back a lot of
memories for me because I was the,

393
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:11,870
the lowest paid as base salesperson at
the startup that I worked for out of

394
00:23:12,731 --> 00:23:16,090
college. And they're like, hmm, you're
really persistent. You're in sales,

395
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:20,110
you're really persistent, you have no
technical background, you're in sales.

396
00:23:20,111 --> 00:23:23,350
Congratulations. And I was like,
ah, okay. Here we go. So smiling,

397
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,760
smiling and dialing.
Yup.

398
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:29,650
And one of the things I did was
very similar to what you did with,

399
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:34,360
uh, taking the potential objection.
And putting it right up front,

400
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:39,310
which was like I'm the same as every
other guy. Yes. Product, different label.

401
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:43,360
Same thing except for this press,
which was the relationship piece.

402
00:23:43,361 --> 00:23:46,550
And I took a very approach
when I was cold calling,

403
00:23:46,551 --> 00:23:51,470
which I did between like I want to say
like seven and eight and six and seven.

404
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:55,790
So I avoided the Times that the gatekeeper
would be manning the phones. Yes.

405
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:58,790
And only called when I thought I could
get the higher ups who had worked longer

406
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:01,730
hours. But I would, um, I would,

407
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,610
I would do my homework so I could
guess what they were currently using,

408
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,730
like Solaris boxes or whatever
that's right on the industry.

409
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:10,700
And then I would say, well not sure that
if this is the right fit at all, um,

410
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,060
if you're using this type of system,
the step system or this ties up system,

411
00:24:14,061 --> 00:24:16,340
it is not at all.
Um,

412
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,400
and I would take all of the potential
weaknesses and just put them right up

413
00:24:19,401 --> 00:24:21,960
front. Uh, what you,

414
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:27,020
you at that point had
already had experience hiring
salespeople. How did you,

415
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:29,600
what did you look for in salespeople?
Or how did you,

416
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:34,570
how did you hire the people who have the
highest likelihood of success or train

417
00:24:34,571 --> 00:24:38,090
them, their ability to connect with
other people and earn their trust?

418
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:42,770
And what are the correlating,
uh,

419
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:46,130
behaviors or qualities
that allow them to do that?

420
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:49,530
That they had to be genuine and it,

421
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:52,610
it couldn't be that they were
manipulating them and to believe in them.

422
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:54,350
It had to be truthful,
right?

423
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:57,620
That if I trusted you that you were
saying something that I could believe you

424
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,330
and that would be true tomorrow as well.

425
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:04,830
So I think that sincerity and
being genuine go a long ways.

426
00:25:05,031 --> 00:25:06,890
And I think even,
you know,

427
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:09,890
it spans differences of personalities
and experiences in life.

428
00:25:09,891 --> 00:25:12,020
But if someone feels like
someone who's really trustworthy,

429
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:17,360
and how do you read that when you
meet someone? If I trust them. Okay.

430
00:25:17,361 --> 00:25:19,790
I'm just gonna I'm gonna, I'm gonna dig
a little bit more. All right. So what,

431
00:25:19,791 --> 00:25:24,680
is that a visceral spider sense or is it
a, that guy's not looking me in the eye.

432
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,890
What is the, is it a gestalt
of all those things? What is,

433
00:25:27,891 --> 00:25:32,510
what is it that leads you to feel that
you can trust or not trust someone? Yeah,

434
00:25:32,511 --> 00:25:34,460
I don't know. I guess, um, yeah,

435
00:25:34,461 --> 00:25:37,640
I've always had an interest in people
and makes them curious and I've always

436
00:25:37,641 --> 00:25:41,480
enjoyed friendships and I don't know
if I could even articulate this.

437
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,720
It's just this subconscious process
that happens that I read whatever the

438
00:25:44,721 --> 00:25:48,410
hundreds of data points that you read
when you meet someone and you intuitively

439
00:25:48,411 --> 00:25:52,450
feel like, yeah, I, I could trust this
person. And the more you gather the,

440
00:25:52,451 --> 00:25:56,060
of course, the higher confidence level it
becomes, of course, like I make mistakes.

441
00:25:56,061 --> 00:25:59,240
I can what else? But, um, I
think it's a fairly accurate,

442
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:02,600
I think most people can read that.
How this works.

443
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:06,710
This is a bit of a lateral step,
but I just saw,

444
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:10,220
and I want to say it's called x Makina.
Yeah.

445
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,850
Which made me think of, I guess
it's Deus Ex Machina, which is the,

446
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:20,360
the machine or God from the machine,
which is when it's a theater expression.

447
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:23,120
I'm all over the place because I've
had enough caffeine and coconut oil.

448
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,390
But it's,
it's when there was a plot,

449
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:30,050
a plot problem that needed to be solved
and the writer couldn't find any other

450
00:26:30,051 --> 00:26:35,051
solution besides having like God descend
from the rafters on a wire and be like,

451
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:39,680
be gone problems. Therefore act three,
it comes to a close good night everyone,

452
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:43,200
but uh,
x Mokena I think that's,

453
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,200
there's a lot of debate about how
Latin has pronounced but no idea.

454
00:26:46,201 --> 00:26:48,900
And then in case,
how long do you think it is?

455
00:26:48,901 --> 00:26:53,901
And we're in 2015 and last I checked
before it computer can read all of those

456
00:26:56,430 --> 00:27:01,430
micro expressions and so on and come
to the same type of trust or not trust

457
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:04,800
conclusion.
If you were a betting man

458
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,660
and this was the price is
right. Yeah, with technology,

459
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:13,080
I don't think I'm qualified to answer.
I will say that

460
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:18,090
the other day I watched a
video online where robots,

461
00:27:18,091 --> 00:27:20,970
we're walking along and then people were
kicking the robots are tripping them or

462
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:22,710
doing something to put up an obstacle.

463
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:27,330
And I had this emotional reaction watching
this happen even though I knew they

464
00:27:27,331 --> 00:27:30,120
were robots.
But watching humans be cruel to robots.

465
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,940
Like if this visceral
reaction inside of me.

466
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,670
And so as you've talked about,
you know,

467
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:39,950
Xbox net and the progression of robotics
to read our emotions and for us to

468
00:27:39,951 --> 00:27:43,420
interact with them, the
emotions real, right? Like the,

469
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,030
our ability to connect with robots.

470
00:27:45,031 --> 00:27:49,460
As significant as I watch my kids interact
with Siri and even other low tech, um,

471
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:53,640
you know, computer, the
interfaces, I think that

472
00:27:55,620 --> 00:28:00,620
we will generally be surprised at
how seamlessly the technology's role

473
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:05,640
throughout society and
how we just interact as we
normally what it will appeal

474
00:28:05,641 --> 00:28:07,770
to our emotions and all
these things we read.

475
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:12,930
Do you think we will have those are
touring test level interactions with

476
00:28:12,931 --> 00:28:17,760
machines within the next five years?
I find that Betty,

477
00:28:17,761 --> 00:28:21,330
Matt, I'll, I'll go longer.
I'll say I'll say a decade.

478
00:28:21,331 --> 00:28:25,980
At least decade at least.
Interesting. All right. Uh,

479
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:30,930
did the credit card processing business
or that experience you became the number

480
00:28:30,931 --> 00:28:33,060
one salesperson? Yeah. Uh,

481
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:38,010
where did obviously very interrelated,
not exactly the same, but how did that,

482
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:42,510
how did you go from there to bring
tree? I did it for a year. And

483
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:49,850
it was amazing because it
was this terribly broken
world over the technology you

484
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:53,220
just was years behind and no one
trusted at a different providers.

485
00:28:53,221 --> 00:28:56,610
It was fragmented with hundreds
of providers. And after doing it,

486
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:00,060
I thought this is a perfect
industry to start a company.

487
00:29:00,061 --> 00:29:04,140
And so I started Braintree to disrupt it.
So just so ripe for it,

488
00:29:04,141 --> 00:29:08,430
for the right technology and the right
disposition as a company to to be honest

489
00:29:08,431 --> 00:29:10,890
and transparent and treat customers.
So they were thrilled.

490
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:15,630
And did you have any technical
background? I didn't know it did not, no.

491
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:20,250
So no computer science? No. No. Mechanical
engineering. Electrical engineering.

492
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:25,890
What was the, and you had one kid at
home at that point to two kids at home.

493
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:27,630
So what was the,

494
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:33,170
do you remember the moment
or the conversation or the
walk in which you decided,

495
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:35,760
yes,

496
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,450
I'm going to forego this sales job where
presumably you're making pretty good

497
00:29:39,451 --> 00:29:41,290
income and start this company?

498
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:47,080
Yeah, so we, what I did to start Braintree
is I had these customers in Utah.

499
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:50,440
I was in Chicago at the Times where I
built Braintree Chicago and I went back to

500
00:29:50,441 --> 00:29:52,210
my 10 best customers in Utah,

501
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:56,260
best meaning like most loyal and also
making me the most amount of money.

502
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,340
And I said, hey, I just started
this company, Braintree.

503
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,670
I would love it if you switched
over your processing to eat.

504
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:03,430
And it was restaurants, retailers,
so it was just terminals.

505
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:08,590
I could use backend processors for it
and I think I had like nine of the 10 say

506
00:30:08,591 --> 00:30:10,870
yes, if I remember right.
And they collected,

507
00:30:10,871 --> 00:30:15,520
we've made me $6,200 a month and it was
enough for me to get going to hire some

508
00:30:15,521 --> 00:30:19,600
part time help and start the company.
And the biggest transition we had,

509
00:30:19,601 --> 00:30:21,400
his open table showed up and they said,
hey,

510
00:30:21,401 --> 00:30:24,820
we have 11,000 restaurants
around the world that we just,

511
00:30:24,821 --> 00:30:29,320
where was open table based California?
It was, yeah. And they somehow found you.

512
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,540
So the cofounder of the
founder of open table,

513
00:30:31,541 --> 00:30:35,270
Chuck Templeton was an advisor and he
knew of the problem they had internally

514
00:30:35,271 --> 00:30:35,381
with,

515
00:30:35,381 --> 00:30:38,950
they had this huge global network of
restaurants and they stored credit card

516
00:30:38,951 --> 00:30:42,760
data when people made reservations
and they had the compliance issue.

517
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:44,200
And so they came to us and they said like,

518
00:30:44,201 --> 00:30:47,740
we have this big problem and we
said we can fix it. And of course,

519
00:30:47,741 --> 00:30:48,880
like I had no idea if I could fix it,

520
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:53,770
but we did a deal with them and that's
when we became a software company.

521
00:30:53,771 --> 00:30:56,440
But it was,
it was a bet the company decision.

522
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:01,270
So in the beginning then Braintree was
like your previous company that you

523
00:31:01,271 --> 00:31:05,020
worked for as a salesperson. It was kind
of a commodity. That's right. Business,

524
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:07,410
but you had the relationships.
That's right. So,

525
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:10,540
so at a couple of related questions,

526
00:31:10,541 --> 00:31:14,920
how on Earth as, um, I assume,

527
00:31:14,921 --> 00:31:17,710
but correct me if I'm wrong,
kind of an unknown quantity at that point.

528
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:20,710
Did you get Templeton as an advisor?

529
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:24,370
We met at a local meetup in
Chicago and we, what kind of meat?

530
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:28,600
It was actually Matt Maloney
and Mike Evans from grubhub.

531
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:33,490
They just went public and, um,
Korangal who was at local entrepreneur,

532
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:36,250
but there's like five or six of us and
people were just getting together to have

533
00:31:36,251 --> 00:31:40,960
breakfast. And he and I hit it off and
he was clearly a great guy. I mean,

534
00:31:40,961 --> 00:31:43,000
he had the right disposition,
the insights.

535
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:44,230
He was advising people around the table.

536
00:31:44,231 --> 00:31:49,231
He was an advisor for Matt and Mike at
Grub hub and he came on and he was my

537
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:53,650
only advisor, uh, for the whole duration
of when I was building Braintree.

538
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,830
No kidding. And, um,

539
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:59,980
how did you get so connected with the,

540
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:02,260
these tech guys when you were not,

541
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:06,310
at least from the first glance
as an outsider looking in,

542
00:32:06,311 --> 00:32:11,170
not in the tech space per
se? Yeah. Or were you,

543
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,860
I don't know. No, I wasn't, I
wasn't connected to software
engineers that at all,

544
00:32:14,861 --> 00:32:15,694
actually.

545
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:19,990
And so I had one friend who I
trusted as a good developer,

546
00:32:19,991 --> 00:32:24,160
people he a high, you know, he has
a good reputation. And I would make,

547
00:32:24,161 --> 00:32:26,470
I would post jobs online and then,
uh,

548
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,240
he would help me interview
these people as they came in.

549
00:32:28,241 --> 00:32:31,880
And as I listened to the questions
he asked and how he discerned what,

550
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:34,480
what made a good engineer.
I learned over time how to decipher.

551
00:32:34,481 --> 00:32:38,680
And it took me a couple hires to get
down and then I found a couple of really

552
00:32:38,681 --> 00:32:42,560
good core engineers and I know how to
benchmark to know what exactly to hire

553
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:46,490
Bolton personality but also coding skills
and we can then build up from there.

554
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:49,140
And so that's how you developed the,

555
00:32:49,141 --> 00:32:52,910
that's how you sort of got your foot
in the door with the tech world. Yeah,

556
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:55,510
that's right. And then the, then,
so when I started Braintree, I,

557
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,410
I have three main goals.

558
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,800
One is that I wanted us to be the
best payments butter in the world for

559
00:33:00,801 --> 00:33:02,120
developers too.

560
00:33:02,121 --> 00:33:05,450
That I wanted our employees to say he was
the best company that ever worked for.

561
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,090
And three that our customers
would write us love letters.

562
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,740
And so on the employee side,

563
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:13,370
I wanted people to literally
go home and rave about work.

564
00:33:13,371 --> 00:33:16,280
To be so excited about the stuff they
were working on and what they did and how

565
00:33:16,281 --> 00:33:17,240
they did it in their peers.

566
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:21,200
And so having high quality engineer's
was really important because no one likes

567
00:33:21,201 --> 00:33:23,480
to work with someone who is
incompetent or causing a problem.

568
00:33:23,481 --> 00:33:25,250
So it was extremely important.

569
00:33:25,251 --> 00:33:29,930
We got like exceptional people
to work and do any of those,

570
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,280
those questions come to mind?

571
00:33:31,281 --> 00:33:36,281
Kind of high level vetting questions for
good engineers on the technical side.

572
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:41,300
Sure. There's a lot on the
personality side that, so we would,

573
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:46,220
what I would try to communicate when we
hired someone was at we payments was not

574
00:33:46,221 --> 00:33:47,360
necessarily changing the world.

575
00:33:47,361 --> 00:33:50,090
It wasn't like we're going to provide
clean water for everyone in the world or

576
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,013
whatever else.

577
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,020
The stadium objective that we were
going to build an exceptional company,

578
00:33:54,021 --> 00:33:56,570
like a company with a soul
that we really cared about.

579
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:59,680
And so I wanted people who
really cared about what they did,

580
00:33:59,681 --> 00:34:01,940
the quality of the product,
the quality interactions,

581
00:34:01,941 --> 00:34:05,090
working with other engineers. So
we're in it for the longterm. It's,

582
00:34:05,091 --> 00:34:09,380
I try to flush it out and interviews
of we're here to do something epic and

583
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:12,470
special. So if that appeals
to you, great. If not,

584
00:34:12,471 --> 00:34:16,970
then how do you, now maybe this comes
back to the uh, the spider sense,

585
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:21,920
but how do you vet people
who are bs singing and acting
in an interview to get a

586
00:34:21,921 --> 00:34:26,560
job versus people who are
the true believers for? Well,

587
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:28,610
so I guess for non engineers,
I would write this,

588
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:32,990
these posts on craigslist to recruit
people and at the very top of the page,

589
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,080
so the assumption was first the person
reading your job ad is not the person you

590
00:34:36,081 --> 00:34:38,720
want to hire. That was
the assumption. Yes. Okay.

591
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:41,870
That the person reading the ad knew
the person you wanted to hire. Ah,

592
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,970
so the very first statement was,
uh,

593
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:48,500
I will pay you $5,000 if you refer
the most capable person, you know,

594
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:52,190
and then it's, then below it it
would say, please do not apply if,

595
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:54,950
and we've list out characteristics of
people who just weren't compatible fire

596
00:34:54,951 --> 00:34:59,810
environment. So we wanted to be
clearly distinctive. And who we were.

597
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:03,530
And then we had a section that said
please do apply f. And so the goal was,

598
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,440
but the do not apply was
first it was first. Yeah.

599
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:10,930
Which had this great psychological effect.
And then the police do uh,

600
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:14,580
apply if we want people to jump
out of their seats and say,

601
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:17,330
this is the environment
I've been dying to be in.

602
00:35:17,331 --> 00:35:21,830
Because the most exceptional people
love to work with exceptional people and

603
00:35:21,831 --> 00:35:25,220
they have a hard time dealing with
people who are not that exceptional.

604
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,430
And so if you build critical
mass around everyone around you,

605
00:35:28,431 --> 00:35:31,040
it's just really good.
Then it feeds upon itself.

606
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,050
And so we wanted to put
that signal out to say,

607
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,210
if you feel like this
and your current job,

608
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,550
like you're the best guy in
the whole company, Best Gallon,

609
00:35:37,551 --> 00:35:40,650
the whole company and everyone else
around you is kind of driving you nuts.

610
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:43,910
Like you can come over here and feel
really good about, about, you know,

611
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:47,010
what you do every day and who you're
working with. How did you choose the name?

612
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:51,510
Braintree. I, so it's funny
being the small company,

613
00:35:51,511 --> 00:35:53,670
I went through this thought
process of like, Hey,

614
00:35:53,671 --> 00:35:57,840
I'm small and I'm insecure so I'm going
to come up with like national federation

615
00:35:57,841 --> 00:36:02,841
of Merchant Services or using big words
that connotates strength and stability

616
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,010
and nothing felt right.

617
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:10,050
And I had just read the biography of
John Adams who was born in Braintree,

618
00:36:10,051 --> 00:36:13,800
Massachusetts, and I really admired
John for his contributions to the world.

619
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:18,330
And so I wanted to come up with a name
that was meaningful to me personally.

620
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:23,250
And it was Braintree. No kidding. I didn't
realize that. Braintree Massachusetts.

621
00:36:23,251 --> 00:36:27,090
Yeah. Wow. I had no idea. Uh, so you,

622
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,700
so you have this advisor,

623
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:34,890
open table opens a lot of doors or
changes the direction of the company,

624
00:36:34,891 --> 00:36:35,730
it sounds like.
That's right.

625
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:41,100
Did it make you nervous that you were
betting the future of the company on

626
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,700
one person effectively?
Who is,

627
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:48,870
I suppose making promises or
pointing to the future and saying,

628
00:36:48,871 --> 00:36:50,370
this is what we can do together?
Well,

629
00:36:50,371 --> 00:36:55,371
so it was a big decision because I
think I was 28 at the time and I grew up

630
00:36:56,161 --> 00:36:59,640
poor. We knew we'd have any
money. And as an entrepreneur,

631
00:36:59,641 --> 00:37:00,690
of course I had never had any money.

632
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:03,180
And so I've been broke my
entire life at this point.

633
00:37:03,181 --> 00:37:05,820
We're making really good money.
We were making I think something like,

634
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,680
I dunno if 200,000 of net income a year.

635
00:37:07,681 --> 00:37:10,920
So it was the first time I actually made
money my entire life and deciding to

636
00:37:10,921 --> 00:37:14,640
become a software shop meant we've
pointed back all the cash back into the

637
00:37:14,641 --> 00:37:15,750
business because I was bootstrapping.

638
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:20,520
I hadn't taken any outside capital and
so it was a huge decision on what to do.

639
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:24,540
But, um, it was also, I knew that I
intuitively knew the industry is broken.

640
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:27,510
I intuitively knew that if we
got the right people there,

641
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:31,350
we could build good software.
And so to me it was a, a Moscow.

642
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:36,510
Are there any, um, so
you mentioned John Adams.

643
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,090
Are there any, uh, books,

644
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:44,120
biographies or otherwise that gave you
confidence and I kind of quit spa to go

645
00:37:48,091 --> 00:37:52,350
for it in those early
formative years? Yeah. I,

646
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:56,520
personal hero of mine is Ernest
Shackleton. Oh yeah. I'll let you,

647
00:37:56,610 --> 00:38:00,530
I'll let you reintroduce people. Yeah,
we probably share a mutual love. Yeah.

648
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:01,980
So 1914,

649
00:38:01,981 --> 00:38:06,981
he went on to the Trans imperial and
Arctic expedition where he tried to cross

650
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:12,030
coast to coast,
the South Pole and Antarctica and the,

651
00:38:12,031 --> 00:38:15,140
what I like about Shackleton and there's
a whole bunch of things like my shackle,

652
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:19,680
the basically to this question is when
he imagined what he wanted to do in the

653
00:38:19,681 --> 00:38:24,000
world, he chose the most
audacious thing imaginable.

654
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:28,170
At the time it was, it was nearly
inconceivable that somebody could do that.

655
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,770
And he chose to do it and he prepped
and he did it and they failed in their,

656
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:36,250
in their debit. Right? But
he's not remembered as a
failure. He's remembered as,

657
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:38,910
as the grit and,
uh,

658
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:42,130
how they actually overcame all the
obstacles that came about during the

659
00:38:42,131 --> 00:38:45,610
expedition. He's hugely
inspirational in my life because I,

660
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:50,230
I apply what I call the Shackleton Sniff
test to everything I do in life that I

661
00:38:50,231 --> 00:38:54,310
contemplate if I'm going about on this
endeavor, does it meet the threshold,

662
00:38:54,311 --> 00:38:55,540
the Shackleton applied that,

663
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:58,750
is this the most audacious
endeavor I could possibly conceive?

664
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:02,710
And in time we'll iterate, we'll change,
we'll pivot that happens of the course,

665
00:39:02,711 --> 00:39:05,830
but I want to start with
that as the contemplation.

666
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:10,510
So it's kind of like a a what
would Shackleton do? Bracelet.
Yeah. Yeah. Better said

667
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:17,020
Shackleton. Uh, why did you move
to Chicago to pursue an MBA?

668
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:21,670
Oh, no kidding. Yeah. Why did you,
are you glad that you got an Mba?

669
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:26,050
I have mixed feelings
about it. School, I've,

670
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:30,130
I was always so bored of school because
I felt like the data rate was so slow as

671
00:39:30,131 --> 00:39:32,050
like a 56 k connection,
right.

672
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:35,680
Sitting in the classroom and the
pace of speech and the data, it just,

673
00:39:35,681 --> 00:39:38,110
I wanted like a gig data transfer.
It,

674
00:39:38,111 --> 00:39:42,630
I wanted to learn so much faster and so
school, which was boring to me and um,

675
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,560
I mean the NBA Mba was, was
helpful but I don't know, um,

676
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:48,160
I guess I had learned in different ways,

677
00:39:48,161 --> 00:39:52,600
mostly from doing and I'd been in the
trenches of entrepreneurship my whole life

678
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:55,180
and that's really how I prefer to learn.
Then of course,

679
00:39:55,181 --> 00:39:57,700
reading on my own and stuff like that.
Let me ask you this.

680
00:39:57,730 --> 00:40:02,730
If you were counseling a
young entrepreneur who was
living somewhere they felt

681
00:40:03,071 --> 00:40:05,500
was, and I'm not saying you
taught us this place cause I've,

682
00:40:05,501 --> 00:40:06,850
I've actually spent quite
a bit of time there,

683
00:40:06,851 --> 00:40:11,140
but if they're living somewhere they
feel doesn't allow them to surround

684
00:40:11,141 --> 00:40:15,460
themselves with other,
uh, highly ambitious,

685
00:40:15,461 --> 00:40:16,540
capable entrepreneurs.
Yeah.

686
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:21,780
And the only way that they could relocate
was to get an MBA say to Chicago,

687
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:24,450
New York Sf. Yeah. Uh,

688
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:28,600
do you think the hundred and 20 k or
whatever it might be would be worth it

689
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:35,140
if someone, if someone, if one of your
kids was considering getting an Mba? Yeah.

690
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:39,070
And let's just say they were kind
of of that age now. Yeah. What,

691
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,320
what might you ask them or,

692
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:46,590
so I remember the very first case study
we did in school was about these guys

693
00:40:47,351 --> 00:40:48,820
who were the Kim Up,

694
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:51,910
I think of the new new golf ball
that was better than the golf balls.

695
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:55,090
And it was about their struggle over
two year period of time to work through

696
00:40:55,091 --> 00:40:58,900
patents and Ip and all get distribution
channels and stuff like that.

697
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:03,280
And then we got together with the
study group to talk about the case.

698
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:05,140
And there were certain questions
we are trying to answer,

699
00:41:05,141 --> 00:41:05,980
I forget what they were,

700
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:11,170
but in my group with our five of us and
we had contemplated things like cost

701
00:41:11,171 --> 00:41:14,590
models and distribution channels and
my mind immediately went to like,

702
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:18,610
how have these people paying for their
rent, other marriage is still intact,

703
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:21,970
right? Like are they emotionally
just too stressed out to function?

704
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:25,400
The way I thought was sewing was,
was uh,

705
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,320
so colored by my experience as an
entrepreneur and it was such a dramatic

706
00:41:29,321 --> 00:41:32,730
difference in how my peers thought.
Uh, people coming in from like Ernst,

707
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:36,680
Ernst and young to logical operations,
yeah. Make their pay grade dramatic.

708
00:41:36,681 --> 00:41:41,681
And so I guess I would say to my son
that the skills you need to succeed in a

709
00:41:42,201 --> 00:41:45,260
certain track of life may
not require that education,

710
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:50,560
that the course out of persistence and
determination and then just the ability

711
00:41:50,931 --> 00:41:54,770
to learn and adapt quickly are much
better suited for trying to do this.

712
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,680
And it doesn't have to say
that education is not helpful.

713
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:59,360
The certainly isn't certain regards, but
there are different types of education.

714
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:02,450
That's right. Yeah. What's
the most valuable thing you
took from business school

715
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,630
or from that experience?
Let me say that.

716
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:12,200
We can come back to it. Yeah.
You're giving me the look

717
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:20,880
or we can drop it. I'm not
sure. Okay. Well that's,
that's, that's fine answer. Uh,

718
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:23,840
I think more people should have that as
an answer. Quite ab. That is the answer.

719
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:29,390
Uh, I was telling my brother were
talking about some really kind of deep

720
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:33,380
philosophical questions and I said, I
just haven't figured it out. And he said,

721
00:42:33,381 --> 00:42:36,780
maybe that's what you figured
out. Exactly. Totally true.

722
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:42,340
Maybe that's not an answer
you need to find. Um, so with,

723
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:46,870
with brain tree then let's,
let's kind of look at, uh, what,

724
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:51,170
what turned rain tree into
a rocket ship or what was,

725
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:55,570
what led to that perception at the
very least. So I am already on,

726
00:42:55,571 --> 00:42:58,910
I had to figure out how to get
customers without any money,

727
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:03,140
which is a hard problem to solve
carbon problem. Right, exactly.

728
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:07,630
And so what I did is I, I
knew that computers, you know,

729
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:11,270
computer software engineers were the
target that I needed to appeal to them.

730
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:16,480
And I knew there were different
communities like python.net ruby on rails,

731
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:18,500
Java,

732
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:21,230
they all hung out in the different
committees and each community had certain

733
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:24,650
characteristics about how they work
together, how collaborative they were,

734
00:43:24,651 --> 00:43:25,520
how chatty the war.

735
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:30,380
And my theory was if I
could find a community of
engineers that were chatty and

736
00:43:30,381 --> 00:43:34,370
that helped each other through a word of
mouth referral basis and I could get a

737
00:43:34,371 --> 00:43:36,710
few of the leaders in that
group to come on board,

738
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:39,620
then it would spread throughout the
community and then we'd go to adjacencies.

739
00:43:39,621 --> 00:43:44,200
And so I did this analysis of looking
at the characteristics and I found that

740
00:43:44,201 --> 00:43:47,440
ruby on rails was the most conducive,
that they were very tight net.

741
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,820
Did you figure this out by
looking at message boards?

742
00:43:49,821 --> 00:43:51,910
How did you go about doing it? No,
I found actually a couple of sites,

743
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:54,560
academic research papers that yeah,

744
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:58,130
that actually measured sociability and
interconnectedness and had like these

745
00:43:58,131 --> 00:44:00,580
maps, the diagrams that showed
what these nodes were and who,

746
00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:01,610
how they inter connected.

747
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:04,730
And then I focused on Ruby on rails and
we've got a couple liters in there like,

748
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:09,600
you know, 37 signals and a few others
get hubs. Good one, hang on, get.

749
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:12,170
Jason and David were amazingly good to us.

750
00:44:12,171 --> 00:44:15,530
Like they would tweet out all the time
and they refer it out. All their friends,

751
00:44:15,531 --> 00:44:16,520
they were fantastic.

752
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:20,630
And so we basically built a business
on word of mouth because, uh, we,

753
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:24,410
we tried so incredibly hard
to be exceptional. We did.

754
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:25,760
So they come on and they would love it,

755
00:44:25,761 --> 00:44:28,880
what we will be built and how we
treated them and they would tell others.

756
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:32,160
So I want to do, I want to really
underscore what you just said

757
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:36,690
because I think it's so important for
anyone who's considering launching a

758
00:44:36,691 --> 00:44:39,780
product or service or business.
And that is that the,

759
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:43,710
your first target is not
the entire market. Right.

760
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:46,860
And when I talk to people
about say book launches,

761
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:52,010
a lot of people want everyone to love
the buck and when they write and promote

762
00:44:52,111 --> 00:44:54,840
and market a book to appeal to everyone.
When everyone,

763
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,900
when you want everyone to
be your customer, customer,
no one is your customer,

764
00:44:57,901 --> 00:44:58,920
especially when you have no money,

765
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:01,690
you need the kind of cost per
acquisition to be as low as pos, right?

766
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:03,650
Ideally zero.
And uh,

767
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:07,260
so when I launched you the four hour
workweek or is formulating the marketing

768
00:45:07,261 --> 00:45:09,510
plan,
I mean you and I have a lot of shared DNA.

769
00:45:09,511 --> 00:45:12,090
We've observed this before
because a lot of different areas,

770
00:45:12,091 --> 00:45:17,091
but I wanted to identify the market I
could communicate with that would have

771
00:45:18,931 --> 00:45:23,560
the,
the highest rebroadcasting ability and uh,

772
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:27,420
very much actually similar to your,
your chattiest checkbox. Right.

773
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:31,440
And I determined that I always want it
to be a market that I understood ideally

774
00:45:31,441 --> 00:45:31,921
belonged to.

775
00:45:31,921 --> 00:45:36,090
And that was the kind of 20 to 35 year
old tech savvy nails and San Francisco,

776
00:45:36,091 --> 00:45:40,800
New York. Right. Primarily.
And, um, and then after, if I,

777
00:45:40,830 --> 00:45:43,140
if I hit a critical mass in that,

778
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,080
in that particular
demographic and psychographic,

779
00:45:46,081 --> 00:45:51,081
say my goal was I think it was 10,000
bucks per week for two weeks and I could

780
00:45:51,631 --> 00:45:54,330
try to identify kind of the conversion
rates and so on to hit that number,

781
00:45:55,010 --> 00:45:59,880
then I knew through word of mouth that
would bleed out both an age range.

782
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:02,290
It would jump from male
to female. Exactly. Uh,

783
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:07,080
but I wanted to identify the people who
are kind of disproportionately creating

784
00:46:07,081 --> 00:46:11,490
the most online content exactly.
At that time. Yep. And um, okay,

785
00:46:11,491 --> 00:46:15,180
so you target ruby on rails and uh,

786
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:19,650
was there a particular tipping point
where you were like, holy Molly.

787
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:21,360
Okay. Well any, any,

788
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:25,140
any particular kind of hockey stick or
breakthrough moments that come to mind?

789
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:28,440
Yeah, so we, let me think.

790
00:46:28,441 --> 00:46:32,670
So we got as customers within the
first couple of years, um, yeah,

791
00:46:32,671 --> 00:46:36,150
37 signals get hub, Uber, Airbnb,

792
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:41,030
living social when they were on
their tear. And we had so many,

793
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,890
do you have the All star team?
We did.

794
00:46:43,891 --> 00:46:47,310
We had some of the best companies in
the whole world using us and that their

795
00:46:47,311 --> 00:46:48,930
growth fueled of credibility,

796
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:51,450
of course in our brand that we are
able to provide great services to them.

797
00:46:51,451 --> 00:46:55,230
So we had this exceptional client
base. That's, that's what it was,

798
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:57,540
is once these guys hit their
growth trajectories, right.

799
00:46:57,541 --> 00:47:00,870
And then once the reputation started
spreading that we were a great provider,

800
00:47:00,871 --> 00:47:03,900
people loved using our service,
they just really built upon itself.

801
00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:08,220
Who were you in that period
of time competing against?

802
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:12,990
Who are your primary competitors?
Initially it was the old guard,

803
00:47:12,991 --> 00:47:17,430
like cybersource and authorize.net and
then processors like first data and

804
00:47:17,431 --> 00:47:18,300
global,
uh,

805
00:47:18,301 --> 00:47:23,080
which were really great targets because
they were dinosaurs and technology. Um,

806
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:27,030
and then stripe launched, uh, I
think about a year or two after us.

807
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:30,610
And they're obviously a fantastic
company and so they became formidable

808
00:47:30,611 --> 00:47:34,230
competitors. Um, and then of course
paypal is always there, right.

809
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:38,920
Doing their thing. And so when,
when you met with the Uber's,

810
00:47:38,921 --> 00:47:42,280
the airbnbs and so on,
how did you convince them to work with us?

811
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:46,420
Um, many. So we did do some outbound,

812
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:48,280
like we did track a lot
of these companies down,

813
00:47:48,281 --> 00:47:51,550
but most of these companies sign up on
their own that we just found out they

814
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:55,570
were customers when they were
going through the underwriting
process. Um, but we,

815
00:47:55,571 --> 00:47:57,640
we did, we did target some of
these companies individually,

816
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:02,160
but most of it was organic.
Got It. And what do you,

817
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:04,840
to what do you,
aside from the word of mouth,

818
00:48:05,770 --> 00:48:09,730
what are other things that facilitated
them finding you natural naturally?

819
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:15,430
The being exceptional that I, this was
the thing I said continually again,

820
00:48:15,431 --> 00:48:19,630
it again internally is that
if we paid attention to

821
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:24,070
creating an environment where
people who interacted with,

822
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:27,430
interacted with us would walk
away and say unbelievable, right?

823
00:48:27,431 --> 00:48:30,070
The software's amazing.
The support is amazing.

824
00:48:30,071 --> 00:48:33,010
That I just love this company and I so
much so that I wanna write them a love

825
00:48:33,011 --> 00:48:35,140
letter.
If we solve that,

826
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:38,170
everything else will take care of
itself because they'd walk away.

827
00:48:38,171 --> 00:48:41,060
And in Catholic in that night when they're
out with their friend getting to bear,

828
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:43,720
they're gonna bring us up because they
had this amazing experience with us where

829
00:48:43,721 --> 00:48:47,050
we solved all the problems and we did
small things like we would the integration

830
00:48:47,051 --> 00:48:47,321
team,

831
00:48:47,321 --> 00:48:50,860
we would see when someone's coating to
the API and if they were having problems

832
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:51,900
with it, we'd reach out and say, Hey,

833
00:48:51,901 --> 00:48:54,580
like we see your code into the
API and the Kevin Problems, uh,

834
00:48:54,590 --> 00:48:57,970
can we help if what? Like who does that?
Like who, who proactively reaches out.

835
00:48:57,971 --> 00:48:59,470
So we tried to do small things at credit.

836
00:48:59,471 --> 00:49:03,010
He's really great experiences for people
that could you explain just for people

837
00:49:03,011 --> 00:49:06,970
who are non technical out there?
So application programming
interface equal, yeah,

838
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:10,750
sorry. Yeah, no, no, no. We're,
we're fine. I love to kind of, uh,

839
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:14,870
it's a very important concept right
in, in a lot of tech. So what,

840
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,330
what does coding to the API mean?

841
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:20,470
So they are programming their software
to speak to our software and there was a

842
00:49:20,471 --> 00:49:21,580
certain way that they would do that.

843
00:49:21,581 --> 00:49:24,670
And so there's a lot of the value
of how that's done. Would be,

844
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:29,020
is our software easy to work
with? Does that make sense?
You know, it's just, yeah.

845
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:33,050
And so your software is,
is behind the scenes. Yeah.

846
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:36,460
Handling transactions. So it's kind
of like you have in a restaurant,

847
00:49:36,461 --> 00:49:38,370
front of the house,
the Maitre d of the waiters and so on.

848
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:41,290
Then you have back of the house,
the restaurant, and you need those.

849
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:45,130
The people in the restaurant never see
the people on the back with all the

850
00:49:45,131 --> 00:49:46,840
flames and cuts out on them.

851
00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:50,500
You need a very reliable way for the
front of the House to talk to the back of

852
00:49:50,501 --> 00:49:54,760
the house. Exactly. That's the API.
That's right. Uh, and it's super,

853
00:49:54,761 --> 00:49:58,450
super important concept. It's how
also, I mean, correct me if I'm wrong,

854
00:49:58,590 --> 00:50:02,080
it's how a lot of companies grow very
quickly just by making that a seamless,

855
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:03,060
that's right. Experience. Yeah.

856
00:50:03,061 --> 00:50:07,060
Making your services broadly available
to a broader ecosystem of engineers. It,

857
00:50:07,061 --> 00:50:07,390
um,

858
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:12,390
your story reminds me of a story told
by one of my favorite people out there.

859
00:50:12,401 --> 00:50:16,060
A guy named Derek Sivers. I don't
know if you know Derek. So Derek is a,

860
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:19,410
uh, it certainly hope to have
him on the podcast sometime,

861
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:22,450
but sort of a philosopher
king in the programming world,

862
00:50:22,451 --> 00:50:25,840
a really fascinating guy, great
teacher, also really great teacher.

863
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:27,560
But he

864
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:31,790
had a very similar focus
on details with CD baby,

865
00:50:31,791 --> 00:50:36,530
the company that he started grew and
then later sold. And uh, I remember he,

866
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:40,430
he told me, and he wrote about this in
his book as well. And if you guys search,

867
00:50:40,431 --> 00:50:41,810
I think I put this on my blog.

868
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:45,890
If you just search search Derek
Sivers letter and then Ferris,

869
00:50:45,891 --> 00:50:50,810
I'm sure it'll pop up. Sivers, s I v
e r s sivers.org. Really Amazing Guy.

870
00:50:50,811 --> 00:50:54,440
But when people would get
their order confirmation email,

871
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:56,600
it was just hilarious.

872
00:50:56,750 --> 00:51:01,070
Kind of elaborate story of like your CD
has been carefully pulled off the shelf

873
00:51:01,071 --> 00:51:04,940
and placed on a satin pillow and then
wrapped in paper by a Japanese origami

874
00:51:04,941 --> 00:51:08,810
specialist. And it was this
just very personable, uh,

875
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:14,150
email confirmation and no one was
doing that. Yes. And so it, it spread,

876
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:19,820
it was such a small detail with,
with huge implications. Yup. Uh, for,

877
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:24,440
for a brand loyalty, for Pr, for us
acquisition, for all of these things.

878
00:51:24,441 --> 00:51:26,480
And it was so easy to do. Yup. Right.

879
00:51:26,481 --> 00:51:29,480
It was not something that
a big company couldn't do.

880
00:51:29,481 --> 00:51:32,630
It was just something a big company
wouldn't do. Yes, typically. Right.

881
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:38,100
What are other, uh, what are
other, um, whether it's, I,

882
00:51:38,101 --> 00:51:42,110
and I hesitate to use this
term, but growth hacks or, uh,

883
00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:45,330
say, uh, rituals,

884
00:51:45,350 --> 00:51:50,350
routines or rules in within Braintree
that allowed you guys helped you guys grow

885
00:51:51,591 --> 00:51:52,424
as quickly as you did?

886
00:51:52,530 --> 00:51:55,710
It's a one we, one thing I focused
on a lot was the second goal,

887
00:51:55,711 --> 00:51:59,790
which was that employees would say it was
the best place they've ever worked and

888
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:03,570
it was this ongoing quest to figure
out how to make that happen. Again,

889
00:52:03,571 --> 00:52:07,740
my goal in my mind was they go home and
rave about what they do on a daily basis.

890
00:52:07,741 --> 00:52:12,480
They feel good in life, that they love
it. And so I always wanted to know what,

891
00:52:12,481 --> 00:52:15,450
what people were feeling and thinking
because if I didn't know that,

892
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:18,960
then I couldn't change or, or
build, you know, certain things.

893
00:52:18,961 --> 00:52:23,730
And so I tried all the normal things of
like we did town halls every week and it

894
00:52:23,731 --> 00:52:27,390
was more like group therapy than it was
company updates where I would let these

895
00:52:27,391 --> 00:52:32,391
long awkward silences persist until like
the fain came up though everyone was

896
00:52:33,511 --> 00:52:36,270
worried about or what they want
to talk about, but no one dared.

897
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:39,390
So what would be an exam?
When would those awkward pauses come?

898
00:52:39,391 --> 00:52:42,810
I would say it does it does. Anyone have
any questions and you just let it sit?

899
00:52:42,870 --> 00:52:43,870
Exactly like we're going to,

900
00:52:43,890 --> 00:52:46,230
we're going to wait until we have some
questions and like I knew there's like

901
00:52:46,231 --> 00:52:49,740
one or two things on everyone's
mind because I could feel
the pressure build all

902
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:53,250
week. Right? I mean the
one thing I learned is pink
elephant expanding. Exactly.

903
00:52:53,890 --> 00:52:57,810
The thing is true in life is that everyone
always has a pebble in their shoe,

904
00:52:58,050 --> 00:52:58,920
always.
Right?

905
00:52:58,921 --> 00:53:03,030
There's something bothering us and that
sometimes by just acknowledging it,

906
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:04,860
it take,
it addresses the problem.

907
00:53:05,310 --> 00:53:08,430
But it seemed like every week we'd built
up this tension in the startup, then we,

908
00:53:08,431 --> 00:53:11,340
you know, in the company and
if we addressed it openly
in the town hall setting,

909
00:53:11,341 --> 00:53:12,174
it would be great.

910
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:16,770
And so I would look as long pauses go and
someone would find that was a hand and

911
00:53:16,771 --> 00:53:17,431
see like,
all right,

912
00:53:17,431 --> 00:53:21,630
like I'm really bothered that we
hired someone for this role instead of

913
00:53:21,631 --> 00:53:25,570
promoting some of them internally.
Right? Like what's going on? Right.

914
00:53:25,590 --> 00:53:28,140
And it was great because you have
a really hard question to answer.

915
00:53:28,141 --> 00:53:32,700
And so I encourage like brutal honesty
back and if they criticized me even

916
00:53:32,701 --> 00:53:36,090
better, right? If they could criticize me
than anything, it was full up and game.

917
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:37,500
But one thing I,
I,

918
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:41,910
I was at this Christmas party one year
and I was talking to the significant

919
00:53:41,911 --> 00:53:43,530
other of one of my employees,

920
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:45,960
this was added company Christmas
party company Christmas party.

921
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:49,950
We're in the buffet line and I say,
so like, how's you know, stolen.

922
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:53,400
So doing like he, he's four months
in and how's he enjoyed life?

923
00:53:53,401 --> 00:53:56,550
And she says like, it's amazing. Like,

924
00:53:56,551 --> 00:54:01,530
he is happy and I, he comes home and he's
energized and he loves his coworkers.

925
00:54:01,531 --> 00:54:06,420
And it's so different from what he
was, how he felt before. And I thought,

926
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:09,510
yes,
like this is the data I want.

927
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:12,690
I cause I want to know
the significant other,

928
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:16,530
knows the most about how that person
feels in life based upon what they do on a

929
00:54:16,531 --> 00:54:17,364
daily basis.

930
00:54:17,670 --> 00:54:22,140
And so it was a constant quest of trying
to find out the right data source of

931
00:54:22,141 --> 00:54:26,490
how people feel in life to
build an exceptional company
and knowing where to go

932
00:54:26,491 --> 00:54:28,350
for that data, how to get
it. And now of course,

933
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:30,810
like I couldn't go interview everyone
all the time. That would be awkward.

934
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:35,580
But just knowing that the data sources
are out there to gather, to build,

935
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:39,630
you know, a good team was really
helpful. So you said, you know, if they,

936
00:54:39,631 --> 00:54:43,410
if they criticize me all the better, what
would you, how would you prompt people?

937
00:54:43,411 --> 00:54:47,920
To be brutally honest, because you're the,
you're the big boss, right? Right. Uh,

938
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:53,060
would you send out an email outlining the
goal of the town hall or would you get

939
00:54:53,161 --> 00:54:56,520
up and talk for a few minutes in the
beginning and try to encourage people to

940
00:54:56,521 --> 00:55:00,450
let that stuff out? What, what, what
did you say in either case? So one,

941
00:55:00,451 --> 00:55:01,284
I think it's a,

942
00:55:01,330 --> 00:55:05,310
a disposition I tried to
be self deprecating where
I would make fun of myself

943
00:55:05,311 --> 00:55:07,410
for things I did or mistakes I had made.

944
00:55:07,411 --> 00:55:11,310
I tried to open the broadcast those so
that they felt comfortable that I owned

945
00:55:11,311 --> 00:55:15,180
up and I wasn't, you know, sensitive
about it. And then I would just, um,

946
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:19,350
I guess in dialogue I would
try to typically own things
myself and to make them

947
00:55:19,351 --> 00:55:22,470
feel comfortable that they could
bring it up. We can discuss it openly.

948
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:27,360
How would you do that? So
if we talked about, um,

949
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:31,650
I'm trying to think of like a
recurring theme that came up. Um,

950
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:34,740
maybe if it came up like two or three
times I can say like, look like this.

951
00:55:34,950 --> 00:55:35,251
Honestly,

952
00:55:35,251 --> 00:55:37,650
he's like my deal because you guys have
brought this up two or three times now.

953
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:40,290
I've not done something
about it that's adequate.

954
00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:43,800
So clearly I'm not doing what I should
be doing because you're doing your job of

955
00:55:43,801 --> 00:55:45,150
being honest and transparent with me.

956
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:47,310
I have not taken the responsibility
of actually acting on this.

957
00:55:47,311 --> 00:55:48,360
So I'm going to go think about this,

958
00:55:48,810 --> 00:55:51,660
put together a plan and do up in the
meantime like this is my problem and my

959
00:55:51,661 --> 00:55:54,390
mistakes. So I'd tried to own
things like that. So it's not,

960
00:55:54,450 --> 00:55:56,960
it's no longer your job to worry about it.
It's my job to worry about that.

961
00:55:56,990 --> 00:55:58,350
Like I hear you.
You did a good job.

962
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:01,020
Thank you for being honest and transparent
because that's what I asked of you.

963
00:56:01,410 --> 00:56:03,330
And you don't have the
power to fix that yourself.

964
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:08,340
This is like a more community
problems. So it's in my, so the,

965
00:56:08,341 --> 00:56:13,300
um, the observation I've had
on multiple occasions and, um,

966
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:18,540
is, uh, you're very persuasive, but I
don't think you'd be very good at lying.

967
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:21,690
And I could be, maybe you're so good
that I would never notice. I don't know.

968
00:56:21,691 --> 00:56:23,500
But I'm, I'm making, I'm
just kidding, obviously,

969
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:28,150
but I don't think you'd be good at lying.
And you seem,

970
00:56:28,151 --> 00:56:29,530
even though you don't
have technical training,

971
00:56:29,531 --> 00:56:33,160
you seem very scientifically minded
and sort of an engineer at heart.

972
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:34,070
Does that make sense?
I mean you,

973
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:39,140
you're very methodical and one thing
that I've personally struggled with is,

974
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,890
Eh, maybe this is through a
lot of competitive sports.

975
00:56:41,891 --> 00:56:46,480
Maybe it's just from being
a working solo so often,

976
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:50,380
uh, I don't want, I generally don't
want, or it's a personality type.

977
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:54,700
I don't want people to
tell me what's going right.

978
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:57,640
I want the bad news because I feel like
the good news we'll take care of itself.

979
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:00,990
Does that make sense? Yeah. And
I think as a result of that, uh,

980
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:05,650
I recognize that one of
my kind of deficiencies

981
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:12,240
as a manager of people is that I'm
not very good or consistent in giving

982
00:57:13,121 --> 00:57:15,040
positive feedback.
Uh,

983
00:57:15,041 --> 00:57:19,240
I don't feel like I erroneously believe
that because I don't necessarily need

984
00:57:19,241 --> 00:57:24,080
that other people probably don't get it
right or I just forget about that. Yup.

985
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:28,510
Uh, how, how did you address that
within brain tree? Because I think it's,

986
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:33,070
at least in my experience,
it is important, uh, to
maintain morale of the troops.

987
00:57:33,071 --> 00:57:37,940
And so on. Uh, what did you do to
help kind of maintain morale and,

988
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:41,540
and that level of happiness that the
significant other, yeah, important.

989
00:57:42,070 --> 00:57:46,180
I would tell stories, I would tell stories
about people and exceptional efforts.

990
00:57:46,510 --> 00:57:49,270
Now it's always a double edged sword
because if you tell a story about one

991
00:57:49,271 --> 00:57:51,670
person, you're not telling a
story about the other person.

992
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,470
And one person that was in it,

993
00:57:53,471 --> 00:57:55,630
Phil left out because like I
was just involved as you know,

994
00:57:55,631 --> 00:57:59,980
him or her and doing this. And so, um,
it is tricky, but I, I always highlight,

995
00:57:59,981 --> 00:58:00,310
we did,

996
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:05,310
I did a weekly emails as well and I want
it to tell stories that people who went

997
00:58:05,381 --> 00:58:06,910
above and beyond the call of duty,

998
00:58:06,970 --> 00:58:11,770
I either in building our software or
a customer service interaction or even

999
00:58:11,771 --> 00:58:15,520
helping a coworker do something. And those
stories resonated with people, right?

1000
00:58:15,521 --> 00:58:19,120
They saw with their peers were doing and
it was influential in how they behaved.

1001
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:24,220
So I wanted to build a culture of a
certain behavior and I told stories to

1002
00:58:24,221 --> 00:58:28,930
reinforce that right at the positive
written for us. And you did.

1003
00:58:28,931 --> 00:58:32,560
How often did he do the
town hall meetings? We did
either weekly or biweekly.

1004
00:58:32,561 --> 00:58:36,820
We kind of fluctuated over the years. What
Day of the week or Friday? Friday? Yeah.

1005
00:58:36,910 --> 00:58:39,730
Why Friday?
It's a different vibe in the company.

1006
00:58:39,731 --> 00:58:43,360
People are kind of reflecting upon the
week. Um, the tension is kind of built up.

1007
00:58:43,361 --> 00:58:47,860
We're going into the weekend, Monday
mornings, a little bit frantic Friday.

1008
00:58:47,861 --> 00:58:52,630
I find people are more pensive
and reflective and that
it was a good time for us

1009
00:58:52,631 --> 00:58:56,980
to dig deep and find out what was really
bothering us and how and re and I guess

1010
00:58:56,981 --> 00:59:00,320
regroup on the essence of why we existed.
Right.

1011
00:59:00,330 --> 00:59:02,350
That if we weren't just
there to make a paycheck,

1012
00:59:02,351 --> 00:59:05,770
we were there to build
something exceptional and to
continually talk about that

1013
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:09,280
was important.
When you were building brain tree,

1014
00:59:09,281 --> 00:59:12,780
when do you feel like you were at your,

1015
00:59:13,670 --> 00:59:15,610
your seek powers?
In other words,

1016
00:59:15,611 --> 00:59:18,760
like when were you pitching a
no hitter in the world series?

1017
00:59:18,790 --> 00:59:22,070
Like at what point in building
brain tree was, I don't

1018
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:24,580
think I could identify it.
It was just so gradual.

1019
00:59:24,581 --> 00:59:28,460
And over time that we started these
companies like Uber and Airbnb,

1020
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:33,320
they hit their growth stride and it was
amazing that we were powering all their

1021
00:59:33,321 --> 00:59:35,030
payments and um,

1022
00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:38,570
it was just so gradual and slow because
companies come on brand new and it takes

1023
00:59:38,571 --> 00:59:42,260
them a couple of years to ramp up to SAR
processing, you know, significant cells.

1024
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:45,380
So I don't know if I could identify
a single point. It's just this slow,

1025
00:59:45,381 --> 00:59:49,970
steady build. When were you under the
most, when did you feel under the most

1026
00:59:50,190 --> 00:59:51,023
pressure?

1027
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:57,350
Always. Okay. So the, the, the, uh,

1028
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:00,080
where I'm trying to lead this is

1029
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:02,353
when,

1030
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:07,900
when you can try to think of when you
were operating at a very high level,

1031
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:10,220
under very high stress.

1032
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:14,240
What did your morning routine look like?

1033
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:16,920
The first say hour of your day
or 10 hours of your day. Okay.

1034
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:21,390
Yeah. So I guess if I think about the
broader context of life, I mean, I had

1035
01:00:23,430 --> 01:00:26,520
two children when I started brain
tree and then, um, you know,

1036
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:31,600
I had three by the end and we had
my first two children with colicky.

1037
01:00:31,851 --> 01:00:35,900
So they're crying all night and so not
be able to sleep very well at night and

1038
01:00:35,910 --> 01:00:37,620
get into the next day and going to work.

1039
01:00:37,621 --> 01:00:39,600
And the Dylan with all
the stuff you deal with,

1040
01:00:40,290 --> 01:00:43,940
it was a pretty tough time in life.
And um,

1041
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:46,400
I mean there were some
dark moments. It's, it's,

1042
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:50,910
I guess something you and I have talked
about on our walks is that I generally

1043
01:00:50,911 --> 01:00:51,691
view advice.

1044
01:00:51,691 --> 01:00:55,170
I'm very skeptical of advice because
it's so contextual and it can be

1045
01:00:55,171 --> 01:00:57,010
deceptively um,

1046
01:00:57,570 --> 01:01:00,630
unhelpful because you don't understand
what's packed into that advice.

1047
01:01:00,631 --> 01:01:04,370
But one piece of advice I think
is helpful for entrepreneurs,

1048
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:08,430
I wish someone would have told me is the
importance of surrounding yourself with

1049
01:01:09,180 --> 01:01:13,260
fellow founders, people who get
you and understand you. Right?

1050
01:01:13,261 --> 01:01:17,910
That all those years as a founder, I felt
like I owned everything. I owned energy,

1051
01:01:17,911 --> 01:01:21,290
I own growth, I own the success.
It was all me and I had,

1052
01:01:21,291 --> 01:01:23,930
it didn't have any cofounders of,
so there's not to say people,

1053
01:01:23,950 --> 01:01:25,020
my team didn't shoulder that bright.

1054
01:01:25,021 --> 01:01:28,770
But as the founder you deal
fill an a extra level of burden.

1055
01:01:29,190 --> 01:01:32,040
And I had no outlet for it.
I owned energy at home.

1056
01:01:32,041 --> 01:01:36,300
I owned energy at work and it
did, it was tough. It took a toll.

1057
01:01:36,301 --> 01:01:40,470
And so over the past couple years, I have
critiques, friendships, like, you know,

1058
01:01:40,471 --> 01:01:45,450
like, like you and I have
where we can talk as if we
were journaling. Right, right.

1059
01:01:45,451 --> 01:01:49,630
I mean, to get to the real raw
and good stuff of life. But, um,

1060
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:53,070
I think that that would have been very
helpful during the dockers times during

1061
01:01:53,071 --> 01:01:57,480
the theme, the moments where it
was the hottest. Yeah. I, um,

1062
01:01:58,590 --> 01:02:01,170
had a, a book inscribed
reaction. It's right there.

1063
01:02:01,230 --> 01:02:06,230
The psychedelic explorer's guide
had Jim Fadiman on the podcast and,

1064
01:02:06,961 --> 01:02:11,070
uh, I thought it was, inscription
was so great. He said, uh, you know,

1065
01:02:11,071 --> 01:02:15,210
to Tim a companion on the path. And I was
like, that's, yeah. And I think, I mean,

1066
01:02:15,211 --> 01:02:18,960
we're literally companions on the path.
Yeah. We go on these hikes, but having

1067
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:23,680
those people who can identify with the
pressures that you're feeling. Yeah.

1068
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:28,760
What were other coping strategies that
you had or routines that were helpful

1069
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:33,200
when you felt you were shold
shouldering all of that burden? Yeah,

1070
01:02:33,201 --> 01:02:37,110
so I always look for hobbies
that would consume my mind,

1071
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:40,650
where I could escape myself because these
things, you could change the channel.

1072
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,660
Exactly. Yeah. For a brief
period of time. Totally.

1073
01:02:42,661 --> 01:02:45,570
Because it's like it loops and loops
and loops and if you try anything else,

1074
01:02:45,571 --> 01:02:47,750
it just loops. Even when you're
having conversations and I cured,

1075
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:49,710
is obsessed with trying
to build your company.

1076
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:53,340
And so one day I had a hard day at
work and I was walking home. I thought,

1077
01:02:53,341 --> 01:02:56,340
you know what? I'm going to go fly an
airplane. Like maybe that'll do the trick.

1078
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:59,940
And I did this discovery flight and
the guy took me up and he's like,

1079
01:02:59,941 --> 01:03:01,440
if you can do the following things,
you can fly.

1080
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:04,500
And he did like this really hard turn up
and down. I got sick and I was like, oh,

1081
01:03:04,501 --> 01:03:06,480
I can never do that.
So crazy and hard.

1082
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:09,240
But I thought about it the next morning
I thought, no, I can actually do this.

1083
01:03:09,390 --> 01:03:13,680
And so I started flying and I lost
myself in aviation. I absolutely love it.

1084
01:03:13,681 --> 01:03:16,800
And so that really helps that I could
find a different place to park my mind.

1085
01:03:16,801 --> 01:03:17,750
And focus is,

1086
01:03:17,890 --> 01:03:22,770
is a discovery flight where like you're
in the passenger seat of a new car and

1087
01:03:22,771 --> 01:03:25,140
they show you what the car can do.
Is that what a discovery flight is?

1088
01:03:25,190 --> 01:03:26,940
It basically, yeah, you
go up and he's like, hey,

1089
01:03:26,941 --> 01:03:30,750
so if you want to get your license, you
have to perform the following maneuvers.

1090
01:03:30,751 --> 01:03:33,240
Like here's a steep turn,
you know, 30 degrees. And,

1091
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:36,510
and so he was just showing me basically
how the plane operator and what I would

1092
01:03:36,511 --> 01:03:40,260
need to do.
And I think for a lot of people listening,

1093
01:03:40,830 --> 01:03:44,940
they think of learning to fly as a
very, very, very, very expensive thing.

1094
01:03:44,941 --> 01:03:47,520
I think they associate it with say,
owning a private jet.

1095
01:03:47,580 --> 01:03:50,610
But that is not the case. Right. I mean,
as far as I understand that, I mean,

1096
01:03:50,611 --> 01:03:54,540
I have friends who work jobs here
who have gotten into aviation. Yeah.

1097
01:03:54,910 --> 01:03:58,130
He is it, uh, how,

1098
01:03:58,170 --> 01:04:02,640
how cost prohibitive is it to become
involved with aviation? In some capacity.

1099
01:04:02,910 --> 01:04:07,380
So I think I paid a few thousand dollars
over the course of the lessons. Got It.

1100
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:10,950
Something like that. Over what period
of time? I believe it took me 90 days.

1101
01:04:11,190 --> 01:04:12,870
Got It. So I mean, all in all,

1102
01:04:12,871 --> 01:04:16,920
not pocket change but not like
buying a Gulf stream. That's right.

1103
01:04:17,610 --> 01:04:21,470
Uh, this is something I've, I've, I've,
I've a number of friends here, uh,

1104
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:26,660
in the bay area who use aviation is
their way of changing the channel,

1105
01:04:27,990 --> 01:04:31,380
right? So they're not
constantly watching sort of yes.

1106
01:04:32,010 --> 01:04:36,720
BBC News or whatever the hell their
world happened. That's right. Um,

1107
01:04:38,220 --> 01:04:42,450
let's see. The, um, when you were 21,

1108
01:04:42,451 --> 01:04:45,900
I think you said 21,
when you were 21,

1109
01:04:46,180 --> 01:04:49,110
and you thought of the word successful,

1110
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:51,390
who is the person who came
to mind at that point for you

1111
01:04:53,030 --> 01:04:56,880
were in that rough range?
I admired people who had,

1112
01:04:59,940 --> 01:05:03,690
I guess I had a number of buckets
in my mind of who I admired.

1113
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:07,260
But one bucket that appealed to me because
I thought I could potentially be like

1114
01:05:07,261 --> 01:05:07,800
them,

1115
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:12,390
was those who had acquired significant
amount of resources and through building

1116
01:05:12,391 --> 01:05:15,810
businesses. And we're now using those
resources to do good in the world,

1117
01:05:16,410 --> 01:05:18,130
that they had freedom of time,

1118
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:21,040
they didn't need to show up for a job
and they didn't write all that kind of

1119
01:05:21,041 --> 01:05:21,221
stuff.

1120
01:05:21,221 --> 01:05:24,940
And so I identified with that because
I think I thought it matched up with my

1121
01:05:24,941 --> 01:05:27,640
potential skill sets and something
I could potentially achieve in life.

1122
01:05:28,150 --> 01:05:28,601
So it really,

1123
01:05:28,601 --> 01:05:33,601
it was freedom of time to do the things
that you could about the most in life.

1124
01:05:34,540 --> 01:05:36,640
So who were,
who were some of those people are,

1125
01:05:36,641 --> 01:05:41,050
who are some of those people growing
up in Utah? Jon Huntsman was,

1126
01:05:41,110 --> 01:05:45,070
I don't know who that, so he built, um,
I'm not even sure what company he built,

1127
01:05:45,190 --> 01:05:49,990
but he was enormously wealthy. And of
course the Marriotts are on there as well.

1128
01:05:49,991 --> 01:05:53,060
But there were a few families in
the community that had accumulated a

1129
01:05:53,061 --> 01:05:55,360
significant resources and they,
they like one,

1130
01:05:55,361 --> 01:05:58,660
I think Huntsman has a cancer institute
at the University of Utah and others

1131
01:05:58,661 --> 01:06:02,830
that they able to move the needle in
significant ways that other people just

1132
01:06:02,831 --> 01:06:04,480
couldn't.
And I thought that was a,

1133
01:06:04,570 --> 01:06:08,290
I thought that was really remarkable
that you could make huge contributions

1134
01:06:08,291 --> 01:06:09,310
potentially to humanity.

1135
01:06:10,220 --> 01:06:10,880
So this is,

1136
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:15,500
this is actually I think a good segue
to one of your current projects.

1137
01:06:15,501 --> 01:06:17,990
I think it's fair to say primary projects,
the Os Fund.

1138
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:22,360
It is. Yep. So could you explain to
people what the Os Fund is? Yeah,

1139
01:06:22,361 --> 01:06:27,160
so the context is I guess at 21 I made
that goal that I wanted to spend my life

1140
01:06:27,161 --> 01:06:28,180
improving people's lives.

1141
01:06:28,210 --> 01:06:32,170
And over the 14 years or so as
I was building my companies,

1142
01:06:32,171 --> 01:06:35,620
I thought a lot about this.
Like what would it look like,
what would it feel like,

1143
01:06:35,621 --> 01:06:37,420
what it tastes like, what
areas, what I focus on?

1144
01:06:37,421 --> 01:06:41,670
And I looked through thousands
and thousands of ideas and uh,

1145
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:45,040
I mean I was always thinking about it
and I studied during that time a lot of

1146
01:06:45,220 --> 01:06:46,990
about science and technology.

1147
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:51,400
And the realization that I came to is
that the reason why our time and place is

1148
01:06:51,401 --> 01:06:56,401
so unique and the arc of humanity is we
literally now have the tools to build

1149
01:06:56,861 --> 01:07:01,000
the kind of world we can dream of. So if
you take computer software and biology,

1150
01:07:01,300 --> 01:07:04,240
genomics, AI, virtual
reality, three d printing,

1151
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:07,090
we can literally program our existence.

1152
01:07:07,630 --> 01:07:11,130
So I think oftentimes if like Davinci
where he had his great sketchbooks,

1153
01:07:11,140 --> 01:07:14,530
where he designed a flying machine
and then these really amazing ideas,

1154
01:07:14,531 --> 01:07:16,570
but he couldn't build it.
He didn't have the tools.

1155
01:07:16,990 --> 01:07:20,940
We can literally build anything today.
And so as I realized that,

1156
01:07:20,941 --> 01:07:24,190
I thought this is like the one of the
biggest moments in the history of mankind

1157
01:07:24,220 --> 01:07:25,570
or humankind.
How do we,

1158
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:28,870
the biggest question for me was what
kind of world are we going to build?

1159
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:31,060
And that's when I started the Os Fund is,

1160
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:36,010
is trying to invest in these tools of
creation that will still dramatically

1161
01:07:36,011 --> 01:07:37,210
effect the kind of world we build.

1162
01:07:38,590 --> 01:07:40,600
Yeah,
it is really a fascinating time.

1163
01:07:40,601 --> 01:07:45,160
And we were able to sort of a Cambrian
explosion of potential where you know

1164
01:07:45,161 --> 01:07:49,750
what, what happens when you
can create virtually anything.

1165
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:54,120
You can download a recipe for a,

1166
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:58,750
an a, a virus that could cause an epidemic
that's right. Or weapon. That's right.

1167
01:07:58,780 --> 01:08:01,390
Or at the same time
obviously use that knife,

1168
01:08:01,391 --> 01:08:06,250
that surgical knife to repair or
build as opposed to damage. Right.

1169
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:10,690
Uh, what now? Oh, s refers
to operating system. Yes.

1170
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:11,920
Why operating system?

1171
01:08:12,170 --> 01:08:17,170
So it's a metaphor I like a lot
that the biggest changes in history,

1172
01:08:17,930 --> 01:08:22,010
the biggest improvements in history have
happened at what I call the operating

1173
01:08:22,011 --> 01:08:23,270
system level.
So for example,

1174
01:08:23,271 --> 01:08:27,680
like germ theory that we tried to figure
out what was causing disease and death

1175
01:08:27,681 --> 01:08:28,341
for a long time.

1176
01:08:28,341 --> 01:08:31,430
And when we figured out there was this
thing like bacteria that cause infections

1177
01:08:31,431 --> 01:08:31,821
and death.

1178
01:08:31,821 --> 01:08:34,850
And then once we figured out sterilization
and antibiotics and vaccines and good

1179
01:08:34,851 --> 01:08:38,000
personal hygiene,
we radically extended healthy human life.

1180
01:08:38,001 --> 01:08:43,001
But it was finding out there was this
core problem of bacteria and every major

1181
01:08:43,041 --> 01:08:45,110
change we've had have,
it has been at this level.

1182
01:08:45,111 --> 01:08:49,250
And so instead of playing with things
out of different level, um, my,

1183
01:08:49,610 --> 01:08:54,530
what we think about is the companies
we invest in are doing world changing

1184
01:08:54,531 --> 01:08:56,330
things at the operating system level.

1185
01:08:56,540 --> 01:09:00,170
So if they're successful in
their endeavors, it would
radically change the world.

1186
01:09:00,350 --> 01:09:03,590
We're in sort of the foundational that's
right level upon which everything else

1187
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:06,410
does. Right? So just like a computer
has an operating system at its core,

1188
01:09:06,411 --> 01:09:09,290
the determines how it works and
there's applications that sit on top,

1189
01:09:09,710 --> 01:09:13,420
everything in life has an
operating system. And what,

1190
01:09:13,421 --> 01:09:18,421
what are some of the investments that
you've made thus far in the Eos Fund?

1191
01:09:18,830 --> 01:09:20,230
Yeah, human longevity, uh,

1192
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:25,300
led by Craig venter is they're trying
to radically extend healthy human life,

1193
01:09:26,030 --> 01:09:26,211
you know,

1194
01:09:26,211 --> 01:09:29,720
into the hundreds and they're doing it
by using the whole human genome and then

1195
01:09:29,721 --> 01:09:32,420
adding data like the metal
biome and phenotype data.

1196
01:09:32,750 --> 01:09:37,750
And then using advanced machine learning
to learn about disease and create

1197
01:09:38,121 --> 01:09:39,650
personal therapeutics.
If they're successful,

1198
01:09:39,651 --> 01:09:44,120
it would change a medicine as we know it.
And it really is fundamental way. Yeah.

1199
01:09:44,850 --> 01:09:47,050
Uh, any others? Uh, yeah,

1200
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:49,910
we just made an investment
in a gingko bioworks,

1201
01:09:49,970 --> 01:09:54,350
which they're basically
making biology programmable.

1202
01:09:54,410 --> 01:09:58,400
So just like we use computer code today
to render a website or process a credit

1203
01:09:58,401 --> 01:10:01,010
card transaction or fly on
autopilot system at an airplane.

1204
01:10:02,060 --> 01:10:05,990
We can program the same
thing in biology for today.

1205
01:10:05,991 --> 01:10:08,690
They're doing fragrances and flavors.
The producing in a lab,

1206
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:11,300
the otherwise would be required in nature.

1207
01:10:11,810 --> 01:10:13,580
And as we climb up the complexity scale,

1208
01:10:13,581 --> 01:10:16,160
we can do much more
complicated things like um,

1209
01:10:16,210 --> 01:10:20,480
work on antibiotic resistance and
Carbon Capture. But the idea, Tim,

1210
01:10:20,481 --> 01:10:24,200
like your biology, I'm biology,
our world runs on biology, right?

1211
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:27,890
The fact that this could be a programming
language we could actually predictably

1212
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:33,260
use is remarkable. Right? Well, what does
it, I mean, I guess DNA is what Atcg,

1213
01:10:33,290 --> 01:10:35,450
right?
I mean it's something along those lines.

1214
01:10:35,451 --> 01:10:37,970
Some of them getting out of my depth here
under the my ignorance pool and pretty

1215
01:10:37,971 --> 01:10:42,080
quickly, but the, uh, to
the fragrances for instance,

1216
01:10:42,081 --> 01:10:45,320
that would be considered, is that
considered synthetic biology? No.

1217
01:10:45,321 --> 01:10:50,180
So they design the organism just like you,
you take yeast for brewing beer, right?

1218
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:51,313
Um,

1219
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:55,610
you take an organism and you can alter
within the production that organism,

1220
01:10:55,611 --> 01:10:58,220
what it produces.
So it's actually a natural in production.

1221
01:10:58,550 --> 01:11:00,290
You're just altering the
organism that produces it,

1222
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:02,510
so it's not synthetic
biology. Interesting. Okay.

1223
01:11:02,511 --> 01:11:07,511
So you're just kind of removing a few
ingredients in a preexisting recipe and

1224
01:11:08,721 --> 01:11:11,660
letting kind of the chef
he's Africanism yes.

1225
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:14,100
So let's take those different food
product. Exactly. It's this new

1226
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:17,910
era of industrial engineering where it's
going to change all the processes we

1227
01:11:17,911 --> 01:11:20,490
created during the first
industrial revolution.

1228
01:11:21,030 --> 01:11:25,050
Now what is your, and you may not
have a strong opinion here and if not,

1229
01:11:25,051 --> 01:11:28,730
that's totally fine, but
people get, uh, very, uh,

1230
01:11:29,970 --> 01:11:34,800
excited, positively and negatively
about, uh, the term Gmo. Yeah.

1231
01:11:35,210 --> 01:11:39,240
Uh, and genetically modified food.
Uh, what is your perspective on that?

1232
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:44,250
So I think that because I
just from personal cause
yeah. A personal standpoint,

1233
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:49,340
there are cases where they can change
the genetics slightly to make something

1234
01:11:49,501 --> 01:11:53,220
say more resistant to that's
right. Pests. That's right. Uh,

1235
01:11:53,340 --> 01:11:55,540
then we, there their start, I,

1236
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:58,910
it seems like we get into an area also
where they're taking something from like

1237
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:01,650
a fish and putting it into a
plant or something like that. Yes.

1238
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:05,220
And then I get a little uneasy and I'm
not sure if that's well founded or not.

1239
01:12:05,330 --> 01:12:10,140
Yup. Uh, because if we start getting
into, uh, you know, I think of all of the,

1240
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:12,700
um,
all of the,

1241
01:12:12,701 --> 01:12:17,610
sort of a horrifying mad scientist novels
that I read when I was a kid. Yeah. Uh,

1242
01:12:17,820 --> 01:12:21,490
but do you think any of those
fears are well founded or,

1243
01:12:21,491 --> 01:12:24,360
or what are the risks of that going wild?
Okay.

1244
01:12:24,361 --> 01:12:26,790
So I'll answer your question
in a different way. Perfect.

1245
01:12:26,791 --> 01:12:31,320
You may not find satisfactory,
but I think it was a very,

1246
01:12:31,321 --> 01:12:34,560
very poorly worded question. So thank
you for saving my ass in the first place.

1247
01:12:35,790 --> 01:12:40,790
So if we start with this premise that we
have these incredibly powerful tools of

1248
01:12:40,861 --> 01:12:44,340
creation, we can program anything.
Okay? That obviously means, and,

1249
01:12:44,350 --> 01:12:45,480
and couple that up with,

1250
01:12:45,510 --> 01:12:49,260
we have this distributed environment
now where anybody can pull the computer

1251
01:12:49,261 --> 01:12:53,720
terminal and anyone in the car in the
world and whatever age and program, right?

1252
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:55,680
Either through biology
or computer software.

1253
01:12:55,681 --> 01:13:00,681
So we have all these tools so we have
a world full of makers to have these

1254
01:13:01,051 --> 01:13:05,610
powers. So with that, what you build
affects me and what I build affects you.

1255
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:10,610
And so one thing that I'm exploring now
with Eos Fund is what I call societies

1256
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:12,270
are social operating systems.

1257
01:13:12,810 --> 01:13:15,600
And there are systems of
cooperation and reconciliation.

1258
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:19,920
So in that category falls like governance
and capitalistic systems, right?

1259
01:13:19,921 --> 01:13:24,210
These belief and value frameworks that
drive our behavior and allow us to

1260
01:13:24,211 --> 01:13:25,050
reconcile our differences.

1261
01:13:25,051 --> 01:13:30,051
So we're going to have some really big
questions to answer and we have to decide

1262
01:13:31,081 --> 01:13:33,390
as a society through our
reconciliation systems,

1263
01:13:33,690 --> 01:13:37,680
do we modify our genetics and our
children? Do we do GMO? Right?

1264
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:40,530
What is appropriate for AI in
terms of what people build?

1265
01:13:40,531 --> 01:13:43,710
So we have really big questions to answer.
And uh,

1266
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:48,600
I think that one of the best areas we
could focus on would be how these social

1267
01:13:48,601 --> 01:13:52,770
operating systems are constructed and
calling attention to them as being

1268
01:13:53,070 --> 01:13:57,600
technologies that can in fact be
built, changed and, and, and, um,

1269
01:13:59,250 --> 01:14:02,430
better aligned with the
realities of our current time.

1270
01:14:03,780 --> 01:14:08,780
The big question topic is a really
fascinating one to me for a whole host of

1271
01:14:09,571 --> 01:14:11,770
reasons.
I remember as an undergraduate,

1272
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:14,830
some of my favorite classes
were philosophy classes,

1273
01:14:14,970 --> 01:14:17,980
introduction to metaphysics or whatever.
And you had say,

1274
01:14:18,070 --> 01:14:21,700
utilitarian philosophers.
I think that's the right term.

1275
01:14:21,701 --> 01:14:24,130
Like Peter Singer for instance,
very controversial.

1276
01:14:24,131 --> 01:14:28,930
I think most of his controversies,
unearned, I think it's
a politicized and so on.

1277
01:14:28,931 --> 01:14:29,711
But you know,

1278
01:14:29,711 --> 01:14:32,890
the question of doing the greatest
good for the greatest number of people,

1279
01:14:32,891 --> 01:14:35,860
how do you make decisions if that's
your objective? Right. And a,

1280
01:14:35,861 --> 01:14:39,880
that would mean if there's like you're
stuck in a cave and there's one fact I

1281
01:14:39,881 --> 01:14:41,890
plugged in the exit and
they're 10 people in the cave,

1282
01:14:41,891 --> 01:14:43,720
we're going to starve to death.
That's right. You killed the fat guy.

1283
01:14:43,780 --> 01:14:47,770
I mean just it's mathematics,
pure and simple. Um,

1284
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:52,920
and that used to be primarily
just a thought exercise,

1285
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:56,470
sort of an academic ivory
tower thought exercise.

1286
01:14:56,920 --> 01:15:01,330
And now you have companies working
on say, autonomous vehicles. Yup.

1287
01:15:01,340 --> 01:15:05,980
And Ai hiring philosophers to
try to advise that's right.

1288
01:15:06,010 --> 01:15:10,030
How to answer these questions when say
an autonomous car is barreling down the

1289
01:15:10,031 --> 01:15:13,690
highway or the Golden Gate Bridge. And
all of a sudden it has to choose between,

1290
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:18,580
you know, hitting the five, uh, you
know, octogenarians in the sidewalk,

1291
01:15:18,581 --> 01:15:22,240
the old ladies or swerving
the other direction and
hitting a car that has a four

1292
01:15:22,241 --> 01:15:25,420
year old. Yes, yes. So how do you make
those value judgments, right? Yep.

1293
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:28,870
And what I'm so curious
about, number one, that's a,

1294
01:15:28,871 --> 01:15:33,850
that's a very multifaceted,
thorny,

1295
01:15:33,851 --> 01:15:36,490
potentially subjective question to tackle,

1296
01:15:36,491 --> 01:15:41,110
but you have to program these vehicles
are entities that's right to behave.

1297
01:15:41,230 --> 01:15:44,080
That's, that's, that's the, you know,
the set of rules. They're programming.

1298
01:15:44,650 --> 01:15:48,340
At the same time, what I really
worry about and, uh, is not,

1299
01:15:49,150 --> 01:15:54,070
not only the, the complexity of
the technology on its own is,

1300
01:15:54,130 --> 01:15:57,270
is a, is a, is a big audition.

1301
01:15:57,380 --> 01:16:02,050
A sort of big audacious challenge
and problem to tackle right by.

1302
01:16:02,051 --> 01:16:04,480
Good. Let's just say, Eh,

1303
01:16:04,620 --> 01:16:08,440
sort of ethically wired,
uh,

1304
01:16:10,390 --> 01:16:13,030
technicians and technologists in
the valley and elsewhere, right?

1305
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:18,100
That's challenging in and of itself,
but how do you address the

1306
01:16:20,020 --> 01:16:22,150
ultimately a lot of say these,

1307
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:24,970
whether it's like a bill of rights
or an arbitration agreement to,

1308
01:16:25,270 --> 01:16:29,140
to manage these social contracts
where everyone's a maker yes.

1309
01:16:29,340 --> 01:16:32,590
Will be dependent on it would seem,
and I want you to challenge me on this,

1310
01:16:32,591 --> 01:16:33,810
if you don't agree with this,
uh,

1311
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:38,400
would be dependent on
legislation and there will be
sort of the, the way that Sh,

1312
01:16:38,580 --> 01:16:42,240
you know, economics is how humans among
other things respond to incentives. Right?

1313
01:16:42,241 --> 01:16:46,360
Right, right. It's like the reward
in a capitalist society say,

1314
01:16:46,361 --> 01:16:49,660
and then the punishment of a love
legal system. Yes, exactly. Yup.

1315
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:51,790
When politicians,

1316
01:16:51,791 --> 01:16:56,620
many politicians are
completely incentivized in
the short term for reelection

1317
01:16:56,800 --> 01:17:01,540
and not envisioning the longterm
implications of some of these massive

1318
01:17:01,541 --> 01:17:05,780
decisions. That's right.
Massive decisions. How do
you contend with that? Like,

1319
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:10,220
or how have you, how have you thought
about this? That's why I, it's such a

1320
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:12,770
hugely important area to focus because

1321
01:17:15,470 --> 01:17:19,040
when people make decisions, you're
looking to really at the surface layer,

1322
01:17:19,310 --> 01:17:24,050
but the beliefs and values that are
driving that are embedded very deeply,

1323
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:26,600
right. Oftentimes that's why
it, that's why, for example,

1324
01:17:26,601 --> 01:17:30,110
like social operating systems
are so incredibly powerful,

1325
01:17:30,111 --> 01:17:32,480
but also they're invisible.

1326
01:17:32,510 --> 01:17:35,330
Like they just are woven into the fabric
of our lives and we don't know they

1327
01:17:35,331 --> 01:17:37,730
exist.
And when we do see them as existing,

1328
01:17:37,731 --> 01:17:40,220
we just consider them as givens are fixed.

1329
01:17:40,820 --> 01:17:45,710
And so what we're hoping to do is
to call attention to what they are,

1330
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:49,020
right. These massive, powerful influence
in our life that drive our decisions.

1331
01:17:49,021 --> 01:17:52,220
And we don't even know it. Right.
But our subconscious, exactly. Yep.

1332
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:56,150
And that identifying them that they
really are social technologies that are

1333
01:17:56,151 --> 01:18:00,210
driving these decisions. And so if we go
to use, I guess a technical, you know,

1334
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:01,940
turn,
like if we go deeper in the stack,

1335
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:04,190
if we go down to the
operating system level,

1336
01:18:04,490 --> 01:18:07,580
like what are these core beliefs in
these core values, where they come from,

1337
01:18:07,581 --> 01:18:09,940
what are they assuming? Yeah.
What are the assumptions?

1338
01:18:10,370 --> 01:18:14,060
And the if then is that are built
into the lowest level. Exactly.

1339
01:18:14,061 --> 01:18:17,180
That affect our decisions on, you
know, the eighth layer. Exactly.

1340
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:20,570
And we've never tracked it back to that
low level because maybe we absorbed them

1341
01:18:20,571 --> 01:18:24,350
during childhood through sac
religion that wasn't of our choosing,

1342
01:18:24,351 --> 01:18:26,660
whatever it might be.
We're over choosing for that matter.

1343
01:18:27,290 --> 01:18:32,290
How do you personally try to identify as
those for yourself in your own personal

1344
01:18:34,611 --> 01:18:37,490
decision making and so
on? Yeah, so at Braintree,

1345
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:42,520
one of the principals I consistently
communicated was challenged all

1346
01:18:42,741 --> 01:18:43,574
assumptions.

1347
01:18:43,820 --> 01:18:47,000
And the story that I accompanied with
it was there's five monkeys in a room,

1348
01:18:47,210 --> 01:18:50,540
there's a basket of bananas at the top.
And the monkeys of course,

1349
01:18:50,541 --> 01:18:53,720
want to climb the ladder to get the
banana. But every time a monkey tries,

1350
01:18:54,110 --> 01:18:55,670
they're all sprayed with cold water.

1351
01:18:56,450 --> 01:18:59,540
And so after a few times be sprayed
by cold water, the monkeys learn,

1352
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:02,660
don't climb up the ladder to get the
bananas can we get sprayed by cold water?

1353
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:06,110
And so they take one monkey out and put
a new monkey in and the new monkey of

1354
01:19:06,111 --> 01:19:08,930
course sees a bananas. It's like, Hey,
like I'm going to go grab a banana.

1355
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:12,920
But when it tries to go up the ladder,
the other monkey grab it and pull it back.

1356
01:19:13,130 --> 01:19:15,320
Like, I don't wanna get sprayed by
cold water. You're a new guy here.

1357
01:19:15,321 --> 01:19:17,540
So like don't mess with,
teach you the rules. Exactly.

1358
01:19:17,750 --> 01:19:22,070
So then they systematically pull
every monkey out, um, and have you,

1359
01:19:22,071 --> 01:19:23,480
and now you have five new monkeys in.

1360
01:19:23,870 --> 01:19:26,390
Anytime a new monkey comes in
and tries to climb the ladder,

1361
01:19:27,020 --> 01:19:28,280
they grabbed the monkey,
pull it back.

1362
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:32,080
But none of the five have
ever been sprayed by cold
water I've ever experienced.

1363
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:36,020
Exactly. And so what I was trying to
wonder is, where is that in my life?

1364
01:19:36,021 --> 01:19:40,870
Like what am I assuming that isn't
visible that I cannot see? And uh,

1365
01:19:40,871 --> 01:19:43,580
of course, when the circumstances
change in a situation like that,

1366
01:19:43,581 --> 01:19:46,610
you have learned helplessness, right?
Or they would say, take a, I mean,

1367
01:19:46,611 --> 01:19:49,580
these are horrible experiments,
but ultimately the data,

1368
01:19:49,581 --> 01:19:51,770
I think it's very valuable
where they would have say a,

1369
01:19:51,790 --> 01:19:53,850
I think it's a Skinner box.
It was used where they, uh,

1370
01:19:54,490 --> 01:19:56,240
subject to animals to shocks.
Yeah.

1371
01:19:56,660 --> 01:20:00,350
And there some animals who could move
from one side to the other and avoid the

1372
01:20:00,351 --> 01:20:03,260
shock, you know, from a pain
on the floor to another pain.

1373
01:20:03,580 --> 01:20:05,570
And then others would
get shock no matter what.

1374
01:20:05,660 --> 01:20:07,860
And then if they moved them into a new box

1375
01:20:08,430 --> 01:20:09,990
where that was no longer the case,

1376
01:20:09,991 --> 01:20:13,470
where they could avoid the shock that
those who had learned it was futile to try

1377
01:20:13,471 --> 01:20:16,290
to move, would just lay on the
floor. Yes. And get shocked. Yes.

1378
01:20:16,530 --> 01:20:20,120
So where does that exist in your
own life? Uh, what, what have you,

1379
01:20:20,130 --> 01:20:22,140
what are some cases if you're
comfortable discussing them,

1380
01:20:22,141 --> 01:20:23,760
where you've discovered that,

1381
01:20:23,850 --> 01:20:27,320
whether it brain tree in a business
capacity or otherwise? Yeah,

1382
01:20:27,430 --> 01:20:30,300
let me think about that.
Um, so many, I mean, I guess

1383
01:20:32,250 --> 01:20:36,390
being human is remarkably tough, right?
You get, we just, so like you and I,

1384
01:20:36,391 --> 01:20:39,390
before this discussion we were talking
about all the funny, irrational things.

1385
01:20:39,391 --> 01:20:43,190
You and I both do inconsistent with
our thought patterns, right. And, uh,

1386
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:45,810
I guess I it a couple of years back,
maybe a decade ago,

1387
01:20:45,811 --> 01:20:49,710
I got into irrational behavior reading
Dan Ariely's book predictably irrational

1388
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:54,510
and thinking fast and slow thinking fast
and slow. Danny Conoman. Yes, exactly.

1389
01:20:54,511 --> 01:20:58,140
So I started reading all these books and
I became increasingly convinced of my

1390
01:20:58,141 --> 01:21:00,540
own,
um,

1391
01:21:01,460 --> 01:21:05,370
what I was fickleness and inability
to actually act rationally in life.

1392
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:07,350
And once I became aware of that,

1393
01:21:07,950 --> 01:21:11,760
I think I became much softer
in my opinions and confidence
levels in life where

1394
01:21:11,790 --> 01:21:15,720
I, I want to question thoroughly
everything I do all the time.

1395
01:21:15,721 --> 01:21:17,670
And of course I miss all
layers a lot of time,

1396
01:21:17,671 --> 01:21:20,790
but I try to be present and knowing
that when I make a decision,

1397
01:21:20,791 --> 01:21:22,200
there's all kinds of layers behind it.

1398
01:21:22,410 --> 01:21:25,590
Many of us are probably flawed and
if I went back and evaluated it,

1399
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:29,730
so I suppose it's just being present and
knowing it exists and how flawed we are

1400
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:34,200
in our abilities when really we think
we're perfectly logical and consistent all

1401
01:21:34,201 --> 01:21:38,520
the time. We're just not. Yeah.
There's um, Dan Ariely's book is great,

1402
01:21:38,521 --> 01:21:39,540
predictably irrational.

1403
01:21:39,540 --> 01:21:42,930
Also a lot of really solid business
takeaways in terms of Hess show. Uh,

1404
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:46,650
how people, I remember the
example he gave in a presentation,

1405
01:21:46,651 --> 01:21:47,550
I'm not sure if it's in the book,

1406
01:21:47,551 --> 01:21:52,551
I'm blanking of the checkout process that
the Economist magazine tested it all.

1407
01:21:54,481 --> 01:21:55,620
That's right. And it was like, you know,

1408
01:21:55,621 --> 01:21:57,900
get the print edition for
this amount by itself.

1409
01:21:57,901 --> 01:22:02,040
Get the digital edition is mount by
itself or get both for this amount and how

1410
01:22:02,110 --> 01:22:06,150
you're changing the pricing and
removing or adding options affected the,

1411
01:22:06,570 --> 01:22:10,350
the average order size. Yes.
So fascinating. Yes. Uh,

1412
01:22:10,351 --> 01:22:13,350
or adding in basically a not
a red herring. It's not that,

1413
01:22:13,351 --> 01:22:15,000
I don't think the right term,
but a a,

1414
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:18,150
a straw man of an option that they
don't even really want you to choose,

1415
01:22:18,151 --> 01:22:21,420
but they'll add the cheaper option just
so they know you'll cause they know that

1416
01:22:21,421 --> 01:22:24,340
50% of the people will take
the middle option totally.

1417
01:22:24,370 --> 01:22:25,620
Just would have been the cheapest before,

1418
01:22:25,621 --> 01:22:28,140
but you would have then exact not chosen.
It just like restaurants,

1419
01:22:28,141 --> 01:22:31,710
I think put like the most expensive
pricey item in the top right corner to say

1420
01:22:31,711 --> 01:22:36,450
like, here's a $75 option. Everything
else is cheap at $32. Same thing with one.

1421
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:40,080
Yeah. Very common. Uh,
when you are feeling,

1422
01:22:40,350 --> 01:22:42,480
and maybe maybe the answer
is you don't feel this way,

1423
01:22:42,481 --> 01:22:44,910
but when you're feeling say overwhelmed,

1424
01:22:45,750 --> 01:22:50,100
how do you unpack that and try to
reduce the sources of that? Overall,

1425
01:22:50,430 --> 01:22:55,080
I've gotten so much better over the years
now I just call a friend and just say,

1426
01:22:55,081 --> 01:22:55,650
you know what?

1427
01:22:55,650 --> 01:22:59,790
I'm feeling overwhelmed and I feel
terrible and I don't think I can do this.

1428
01:22:59,820 --> 01:23:03,030
And right just saying it out loud like,
yeah, I actually, I can, I got this,

1429
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:06,850
but I just need to get that off my chest.
And I'm all, and so when I deal with,

1430
01:23:06,851 --> 01:23:08,070
when I work with entrepreneurs now,

1431
01:23:08,110 --> 01:23:09,820
people I'm invested in or
otherwise they say like,

1432
01:23:09,910 --> 01:23:13,790
if you want to chat anytime the
day and say anything, right,

1433
01:23:13,810 --> 01:23:17,860
no judgment on my side. Just say it out
loud, do it. And I think there's just,

1434
01:23:18,820 --> 01:23:23,110
it's, it's hard to do hard things. I
guess is has been Horowitz would say,

1435
01:23:23,590 --> 01:23:28,590
and having the ability to be vulnerable
and honest and transparent and raw with

1436
01:23:30,311 --> 01:23:35,290
other people is immensely helpful
for me. Yeah. But you weren't always,

1437
01:23:35,940 --> 01:23:37,270
no,
not always do that.

1438
01:23:37,300 --> 01:23:40,360
Now I was extremely private and
guarded and I owned everything.

1439
01:23:40,361 --> 01:23:45,220
I didn't dare come out of let go. And I
think men are particularly bad at that.

1440
01:23:45,460 --> 01:23:48,610
Uh, I agree. I, uh, yeah,

1441
01:23:48,611 --> 01:23:51,840
I've struggled with this myself and,
uh,

1442
01:23:51,940 --> 01:23:54,070
you're so on point and
it's such a simple answer,

1443
01:23:54,340 --> 01:23:57,640
seemingly self evident and
obvious. Right. But, uh,

1444
01:23:59,350 --> 01:24:02,950
I think it points to something
I've noticed about myself
and I tend to be stuck

1445
01:24:02,951 --> 01:24:05,800
in my kind of prefrontal
cortex. Yeah. Yeah. But if,

1446
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:08,260
if you haven't kind of thought your way,

1447
01:24:08,620 --> 01:24:12,100
if you haven't rationalized your way or
that's not the right reasons your way

1448
01:24:12,130 --> 01:24:16,780
into a problem, it's hard to reason your
way out of it. I agree. Uh, just by,

1449
01:24:17,020 --> 01:24:21,940
by relying on the sort of internal
pro and con list and like schematic of

1450
01:24:21,941 --> 01:24:25,180
something that is purely emotional or
maybe based on some operating system flaw

1451
01:24:25,181 --> 01:24:29,190
that you're experiencing it. Yeah. Uh,
so yeah, just calling a friend. Yeah.

1452
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:33,790
But that's like what I love about the
friendships that I have is I can go into a

1453
01:24:33,791 --> 01:24:36,160
conversation and I know when I leave,
two things will happen.

1454
01:24:36,161 --> 01:24:40,510
One is they will have challenged my
mental models that I can't change it.

1455
01:24:40,511 --> 01:24:43,210
I can't see my mental models and I
can't challenge myself very well,

1456
01:24:43,540 --> 01:24:46,150
but someone else can see it. So clearly
they can just call it out. Right.

1457
01:24:46,151 --> 01:24:49,060
And number two is when I leave
the competition is saying like,

1458
01:24:49,210 --> 01:24:52,420
I want to become a better person,
right? And I want to do more in life.

1459
01:24:52,421 --> 01:24:53,380
And I went to work harder.

1460
01:24:53,710 --> 01:24:56,470
Like those are the two things I think
I value the most and the attractions.

1461
01:24:56,471 --> 01:24:59,050
And so it's, I want to be
that for other people, right?

1462
01:24:59,051 --> 01:25:01,930
That when they bring something to
me, I can flip it and say, yeah,

1463
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:04,930
here's a different model for
you to contemplate and to
hopefully when they leave

1464
01:25:04,931 --> 01:25:06,100
they say, you know what? Yes. Like,

1465
01:25:06,130 --> 01:25:10,690
I can do this and I've got that much more
energy to go about it. I find also, uh,

1466
01:25:10,870 --> 01:25:11,051
you know,

1467
01:25:11,051 --> 01:25:15,610
my version of talking to
someone very often is a
journaling in the morning. Yeah.

1468
01:25:15,730 --> 01:25:18,640
Just to take what I feel.
For instance,

1469
01:25:18,641 --> 01:25:23,290
if I'm feeling overwhelmed or having some
type of problem or source of anxiety,

1470
01:25:23,291 --> 01:25:27,750
putting it on paper makes me realize
how absurdly unfounded it is. I,

1471
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:32,200
that's magical. And I think
that, you know, it can be,

1472
01:25:32,230 --> 01:25:35,350
if you don't have a friend to call,
who's going to challenge you in that way?

1473
01:25:35,650 --> 01:25:40,540
Just putting it freezing your thought on
paper can provide you with a sufficient

1474
01:25:40,541 --> 01:25:44,890
mirror in which you can see.
It's completely ridiculous.
Like I thought I had,

1475
01:25:45,130 --> 01:25:45,311
you know,

1476
01:25:45,311 --> 01:25:47,620
I looked like the elephant man and in
fact it's just the tiny little pimple on

1477
01:25:47,621 --> 01:25:49,660
the side of my head. Like, stop
freaking out. It's not a big deal.

1478
01:25:49,661 --> 01:25:52,450
And it's transient or reversible or both.
Um,

1479
01:25:52,990 --> 01:25:55,570
so a couple of 'em just to
shift gears for a minute.

1480
01:25:56,160 --> 01:25:59,720
A couple of a rapid fire
questions that you can you,

1481
01:25:59,940 --> 01:26:02,280
which don't have to have rapid
fire answers. Okay. You didn't,

1482
01:26:02,290 --> 01:26:04,160
so you can take an hour you want.
Uh,

1483
01:26:04,220 --> 01:26:08,420
but I'm not very witty quick. Okay. So
I'll try my best to get fast enough.

1484
01:26:08,810 --> 01:26:10,700
Uh,
in the last,

1485
01:26:10,701 --> 01:26:14,150
say six months to year or the
first thing that comes to mind,

1486
01:26:14,151 --> 01:26:18,200
what is something a purchase you've
made for less than a hundred dollars?

1487
01:26:18,201 --> 01:26:20,390
So it had a significantly
positive impact on your life.

1488
01:26:24,390 --> 01:26:25,223
Okay.

1489
01:26:25,450 --> 01:26:27,160
I have water. So take your time. Okay.

1490
01:26:28,780 --> 01:26:29,180
Yeah.

1491
01:26:29,180 --> 01:26:30,900
Um,
I would probably say,

1492
01:26:34,710 --> 01:26:38,610
I don't know. Okay. We'll come back
to it. All right. We'll come back. Uh,

1493
01:26:40,650 --> 01:26:43,130
do you idea, I mean that's, that's,

1494
01:26:43,160 --> 01:26:44,790
that's not the right question
because it gives you an out,

1495
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:48,360
what historical figure
do you identify with?

1496
01:26:50,340 --> 01:26:52,830
So I love biographies.

1497
01:26:53,130 --> 01:26:58,130
I read probably a hundred plus biographies
and I don't know if there's one

1498
01:27:00,150 --> 01:27:03,030
person in particular might be
just a collection. Actually, no,

1499
01:27:03,031 --> 01:27:05,310
actually I would say
there's, there's a few, um,

1500
01:27:06,220 --> 01:27:10,370
one we talked about before
Shackleton, he resonates with me, uh,

1501
01:27:10,470 --> 01:27:13,050
at a deep level too.

1502
01:27:13,320 --> 01:27:18,320
I've read this book called a good
man by Mark Shriver about his dad,

1503
01:27:18,421 --> 01:27:19,111
sorry,
Trevor,

1504
01:27:19,111 --> 01:27:23,220
who worked in the Johnson administration
and started the Peace Corps and, and um,

1505
01:27:24,060 --> 01:27:29,010
he was a remarkable man and an
exceptional father, a good friend, loyal.

1506
01:27:29,070 --> 01:27:33,990
And he is a mental model of the kind
of person I want to be in life. So, um,

1507
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:37,250
that three I'd probably say,
uh,

1508
01:27:37,350 --> 01:27:41,940
Viktor Frankl's man's search for
happiness. That happiness or meaning,

1509
01:27:42,750 --> 01:27:46,020
meaning. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So
thanks very interrelated though. Yeah.

1510
01:27:46,021 --> 01:27:50,820
But the [inaudible] one of the driving
philosophies of life thing it drives me

1511
01:27:50,821 --> 01:27:55,200
the most is the stuff I guess I
find the most beautiful is the,

1512
01:27:55,201 --> 01:28:00,000
we have the ability to author life in
life. Don't worry about it, but we,

1513
01:28:00,350 --> 01:28:02,340
we can choose not to take
default fault routes.

1514
01:28:02,370 --> 01:28:07,020
We can choose to take different paths that
we can design and do whatever we want.

1515
01:28:07,350 --> 01:28:11,550
And I find that's why I
find entrepreneurship so
appealing is that you get to

1516
01:28:11,551 --> 01:28:14,520
design your own world.
And so in my office actually I hired,

1517
01:28:14,521 --> 01:28:18,170
I commissioned a graffiti artist. I, you
send me a photo of this, I remember. Yeah,

1518
01:28:18,270 --> 01:28:19,440
no, explain it please. Okay.

1519
01:28:19,441 --> 01:28:22,920
So on one side is get off the gray and
the other side is, is Harry Potter.

1520
01:28:23,340 --> 01:28:28,340
And they have their wands and staff's
pointed up and it's is exploding energy in

1521
01:28:28,711 --> 01:28:31,740
the middle of the air with his book
that's open blank pages for the pen.

1522
01:28:32,100 --> 01:28:35,730
And then above it, and graffiti is the
word dream. And the concept behind it is,

1523
01:28:35,731 --> 01:28:37,280
is Jrr Tolkien and,

1524
01:28:37,290 --> 01:28:42,290
and J K Rowling created worlds that
we inhabited through the tool of text,

1525
01:28:43,260 --> 01:28:46,380
right? They wrote this stuff
down and then we inhabited.

1526
01:28:46,390 --> 01:28:48,660
And so they literally authored worlds.

1527
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:51,840
And we have that same ability as
entrepreneurs to build companies, right?

1528
01:28:51,870 --> 01:28:53,370
In everything we do,
we have that.

1529
01:28:53,371 --> 01:28:56,100
And especially our tools of creation now
that we're invested in at the Os Fund,

1530
01:28:56,670 --> 01:29:01,650
as I wanted to use pop culture figures
because I wanted my kids see this,

1531
01:29:01,651 --> 01:29:04,800
that they have that
ability to do that in life.

1532
01:29:04,801 --> 01:29:07,320
That they don't need to say
yes to the default options,

1533
01:29:07,380 --> 01:29:10,500
that they can carve her own path.
And even though it's incredibly hard,

1534
01:29:10,501 --> 01:29:13,140
it's gonna be painful to me,

1535
01:29:13,141 --> 01:29:18,141
it's so much more fulfilling than
a secure and safe way to live life.

1536
01:29:19,530 --> 01:29:20,100
And I think it is,

1537
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:24,420
it's also just worth kind of rewinding
and pointing something out to folks,

1538
01:29:24,421 --> 01:29:26,940
which is, you didn't come
from, as far as I know,

1539
01:29:26,941 --> 01:29:30,630
I mean a wealthy family
where that was the kind of

1540
01:29:32,250 --> 01:29:36,240
a default.
I was that the default belief system,

1541
01:29:36,420 --> 01:29:39,870
maybe it was maybe a, despite the,
the financial challenges. Let me,

1542
01:29:39,871 --> 01:29:42,750
because I think I recall you
telling me that, uh, your,

1543
01:29:43,150 --> 01:29:46,960
your mom made some of your clothing that
you wear to school dead. Yeah. So it's,

1544
01:29:46,970 --> 01:29:51,970
it's not like you sort of came in with
every possible advantage that people

1545
01:29:52,291 --> 01:29:55,890
might assume is required
to think that way. Uh,

1546
01:29:57,270 --> 01:29:59,280
the authoring of your own world.
So

1547
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:03,770
I'm going to come back to
that and I realized the,

1548
01:30:04,060 --> 01:30:06,570
the successful question I think
could be broken down a few ways.

1549
01:30:06,571 --> 01:30:10,920
So you just brought up with that
biography. The first one, a good man. The,

1550
01:30:11,700 --> 01:30:15,810
the thought in my head that you can model
different people for different traits.

1551
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:19,170
Yeah. Right. Which has its own risks
because you might absorb bad habits.

1552
01:30:19,171 --> 01:30:22,650
That's why spending time with those
people without realizing it. Uh,

1553
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:26,630
sort of like viruses in here, you
know, bugs in the [inaudible], but uh,

1554
01:30:27,300 --> 01:30:30,780
but that person correlated to the values,
right?

1555
01:30:30,781 --> 01:30:32,550
So modeling that person based on values.

1556
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:38,000
If you were modeling who
is an entrepreneur or who
are entrepreneurs that you

1557
01:30:38,550 --> 01:30:40,170
admire for their aggression.

1558
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:46,800
So I'd say actually like a
bunch of names pop up. Yeah.

1559
01:30:46,850 --> 01:30:50,690
People I've invested in at the less
fun. So a mean Craig venter. Yeah,

1560
01:30:50,720 --> 01:30:55,190
I hit longevity at Peter Diamandis.
Uh, there's, well Josh Tetrick,

1561
01:30:55,610 --> 01:30:58,940
Hampton Creek, Jason
Kelly, Gingko bioworks,

1562
01:30:58,941 --> 01:31:03,170
Daniel Fong at Lightsail,
Scott Phoenix at vicarious.

1563
01:31:03,410 --> 01:31:07,500
I mean we have a great roster of
incredibly passionate entrepreneurs.

1564
01:31:07,910 --> 01:31:10,670
Mustafa Suleyman deep mind.
I wasn't an investor there,

1565
01:31:10,671 --> 01:31:14,000
but I find him immensely
inspiring. But, um,

1566
01:31:14,510 --> 01:31:18,820
these entrepreneurs think
differently about the world and, um,

1567
01:31:19,130 --> 01:31:23,240
they're going after extremely
hard challenges and I'd
say there are Dacia send

1568
01:31:23,300 --> 01:31:24,830
determined and very aggressive.

1569
01:31:27,540 --> 01:31:31,800
Got It. Okay. So now let's see.

1570
01:31:33,420 --> 01:31:38,300
Do you define, would you describe
yourself as aggressive? I am. Uh,

1571
01:31:38,770 --> 01:31:40,500
in what ways are you most aggressive?

1572
01:31:40,950 --> 01:31:44,720
Um,
when I see something I want to go after,

1573
01:31:46,010 --> 01:31:48,790
be relentless. And, um,

1574
01:31:49,190 --> 01:31:54,140
which entrepreneurs do you
most admire for their end?

1575
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:55,220
I'll have to say,

1576
01:31:55,910 --> 01:31:59,950
you'll have to choose either a smaller
subset of the people who invested with or,

1577
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:03,380
uh, you can choose other people,
which might be safer, uh,

1578
01:32:03,490 --> 01:32:05,050
but for their resourcefulness.

1579
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:09,633
All right,
so

1580
01:32:13,750 --> 01:32:14,531
let's come back to that.

1581
01:32:14,531 --> 01:32:16,960
I know I'm going to have a lot of
examples to think of people who,

1582
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:21,430
who have faced near and a certain death
countless times was somehow they figured

1583
01:32:21,431 --> 01:32:24,550
out to maneuver right around the problems,
right?

1584
01:32:24,580 --> 01:32:26,560
To sort of a neo in the matrix,

1585
01:32:26,561 --> 01:32:29,650
do the backbend and dodge the bullets and
come back to that. Yeah, exactly. I mean,

1586
01:32:29,651 --> 01:32:33,550
that's the essence of entrepreneurship.
So that, that's actually a,

1587
01:32:35,210 --> 01:32:37,150
that's actually a good segue.

1588
01:32:37,180 --> 01:32:40,930
So what do you think an entrepreneur is?

1589
01:32:41,650 --> 01:32:46,150
What does an entrepreneur,
someone willing to us like? Um,

1590
01:32:46,210 --> 01:32:50,200
I think entrepreneurs and explorers have
a lot in common with like Shackleton

1591
01:32:50,950 --> 01:32:52,140
that they chart that he,

1592
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:57,300
they head off an uncharted territory and
they maintain this ability to adapt to

1593
01:32:59,111 --> 01:33:02,560
circumstances that are chaotic,
unknown,

1594
01:33:02,590 --> 01:33:07,590
an extremely challenging and they can
maintain some order in all the chaos to

1595
01:33:10,301 --> 01:33:14,590
actually achieve a goal.
What are practices,

1596
01:33:16,060 --> 01:33:16,570
uh,

1597
01:33:16,570 --> 01:33:21,570
experiments maybe that people could
perform to help them develop those

1598
01:33:22,811 --> 01:33:23,644
characteristics?

1599
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:28,510
Is there anything else that you find
sort of ports well over to that chaotic,

1600
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:32,950
uncertain nature of startups,
small companies.

1601
01:33:33,700 --> 01:33:34,810
So I guess we,

1602
01:33:34,811 --> 01:33:37,810
I have a lot of conversations with
people who want to start their own thing.

1603
01:33:38,110 --> 01:33:40,360
And one of my favorite
questions to ask is,

1604
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:46,090
is this an itch or is it, you know,
burning, right? So it's just an itch.

1605
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:51,120
It's not sufficient and it gets to this
point of how badly do you really want

1606
01:33:51,881 --> 01:33:54,610
it? And for me, I burned the boats.

1607
01:33:54,640 --> 01:33:59,290
Like there was no way I was going to
get a job and so fell you with never an

1608
01:33:59,291 --> 01:34:03,580
option. I had to make this work
and I did have jobs on the way,

1609
01:34:03,581 --> 01:34:05,950
but that was just to simply
to pay the bills. But, um,

1610
01:34:08,050 --> 01:34:11,230
failure just wasn't a
solution I would accept.

1611
01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:14,860
And so I think I want to get it
entrepreneurs that how badly you want it,

1612
01:34:14,861 --> 01:34:16,870
what will you do to get there?
Yeah,

1613
01:34:17,470 --> 01:34:22,270
I find it very difficult in the current
environment to identify those people

1614
01:34:23,080 --> 01:34:26,290
because things are so frothy right now.

1615
01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:31,480
A lot of people who would otherwise
be risk intolerant and fearful of

1616
01:34:31,901 --> 01:34:36,370
uncertainty are jumping into the fray as
founders. I mean you have in this look,

1617
01:34:36,371 --> 01:34:39,400
I, lot of my very close friends come
out of Mckinsey and places like that,

1618
01:34:39,401 --> 01:34:42,130
but when people with very
high paid consultants,

1619
01:34:42,190 --> 01:34:46,630
consulting jobs are then jumping into
startups, I started to wonder what, uh,

1620
01:34:46,631 --> 01:34:51,010
what is on the, what is on the
horizon? And if I look back,

1621
01:34:52,030 --> 01:34:57,030
a very kind of macro timing way to
at least narrow down the field a bit.

1622
01:34:59,151 --> 01:35:02,930
So it's easier to find. Those people
seem to be investing during recessions.

1623
01:35:03,470 --> 01:35:08,470
So that sort of investing right after
crashes it left sort of the people who

1624
01:35:08,901 --> 01:35:13,310
couldn't conceive of doing anything else.
Standing on the playing field. Yeah.

1625
01:35:13,370 --> 01:35:15,620
And the sort of fairweather investors,

1626
01:35:15,621 --> 01:35:19,100
the fairweather entrepreneurs all went
back to doing whatever they perceive to

1627
01:35:19,101 --> 01:35:23,630
be charted territory. Yeah, exactly.
Me, I guess I want to be careful,

1628
01:35:23,631 --> 01:35:27,400
like I don't want to be like an
entrepreneur definition snob and right.

1629
01:35:27,410 --> 01:35:30,200
And suggest that I was going to come
out and pound the table and yell at you

1630
01:35:30,201 --> 01:35:30,700
about that.

1631
01:35:30,700 --> 01:35:34,640
But these attributes are held by people
within companies who are starting their

1632
01:35:34,641 --> 01:35:38,820
companies who are working with larger
institutions. Right. But it's, it's, uh,

1633
01:35:39,560 --> 01:35:43,100
it just inherently people who can create,

1634
01:35:43,190 --> 01:35:48,110
do and see what others
cannot or will not do. Right.

1635
01:35:48,170 --> 01:35:52,770
That they will blaze something to
others will follow or benefit from. And,

1636
01:35:53,390 --> 01:35:56,720
hmm. Uh, let me,

1637
01:35:56,810 --> 01:36:00,440
let me dive in to a couple
of other questions also. Uh,

1638
01:36:01,670 --> 01:36:05,810
do you have a, uh, a book
that you've gifted often?

1639
01:36:05,811 --> 01:36:07,820
Are there any books that you've
gifted to other people? Often?

1640
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:13,960
I have gifted a good man to quite a
few people and Shackleton and Victor

1641
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,280
Frankel's book. Um, they're good man.

1642
01:36:16,281 --> 01:36:19,190
I gift because if we contemplate how,

1643
01:36:19,390 --> 01:36:23,900
like I wonder what would my
son or daughter say about me?

1644
01:36:24,570 --> 01:36:28,190
Why kind of biography would they? Right.
And that's a model for me. I would want,

1645
01:36:28,700 --> 01:36:32,880
um, Shackleton. That's how I want
to behave in life. And Frankl, uh,

1646
01:36:33,260 --> 01:36:34,910
that's how he,
he,

1647
01:36:34,911 --> 01:36:38,690
his basic point is no matter the
conditions we surround ourselves in,

1648
01:36:39,410 --> 01:36:44,360
we can author our life, right? We
can offer whatever, how we respond.

1649
01:36:44,780 --> 01:36:47,750
And then I guess it also love
throwing their set. Artha yeah.

1650
01:36:47,780 --> 01:36:51,020
Have you had that Herman Hesse,
women Hesta I guess in German.

1651
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:55,850
I love that book that came up
yesterday on a, on a walk with

1652
01:36:57,380 --> 01:36:59,990
someone. I won't name because it was
a private conversation, but very,

1653
01:36:59,991 --> 01:37:04,520
very successful guy that I also
admire a lot for his sort of deep,

1654
01:37:04,610 --> 01:37:08,750
deep thinking or unimportant philosophical
questions sit harder came up. Um,

1655
01:37:08,780 --> 01:37:12,150
that's also come up I think with my
conversation with Josh Waitzkin who is on

1656
01:37:12,190 --> 01:37:14,990
the second interview ever on this podcast,

1657
01:37:14,991 --> 01:37:18,680
who is the basis for searching for
Bobby Fischer known as a chess prodigy.

1658
01:37:18,681 --> 01:37:19,371
But yeah,
really,

1659
01:37:19,371 --> 01:37:22,220
I don't think it's appropriate cause he's
applied is going to learning framework

1660
01:37:22,580 --> 01:37:27,290
to many different areas. But that
book comes up a lot. It's a very, uh,

1661
01:37:27,710 --> 01:37:29,680
sort of allegorical. But, um,

1662
01:37:30,140 --> 01:37:34,990
oftentimes I think that deep truths can
be explored more effectively in fiction

1663
01:37:34,991 --> 01:37:37,130
and nonfiction. Right. Uh,

1664
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:41,870
because it pulls you out of your normal
context. Yes. In a way. Yes. You're,

1665
01:37:41,880 --> 01:37:46,400
you're not, you're your programs. You're
problem solving software isn't running.

1666
01:37:46,401 --> 01:37:50,660
So that blindsides you new
mental models. Yeah, exactly. Uh,

1667
01:37:51,470 --> 01:37:52,350
the,
um,

1668
01:37:54,410 --> 01:37:59,410
I had a profound that just escaped
my semi ketogenic brain or Qatar,

1669
01:37:59,950 --> 01:38:01,860
Bahrain.
I'm probably right on the,

1670
01:38:02,070 --> 01:38:05,720
I think we were talking about this just
before and I had 0.6 millimeters cause I

1671
01:38:05,820 --> 01:38:08,610
fell out of Ketosis and then I'm just
getting back and had some coconut oil.

1672
01:38:08,611 --> 01:38:11,700
But I think that's kept me going for
about 60 minutes. So I'm probably in the,

1673
01:38:11,701 --> 01:38:16,560
in the, the no man's land, the gray
zone of substrate suffering. Uh,

1674
01:38:17,640 --> 01:38:20,430
what's, uh, if you could have,

1675
01:38:21,540 --> 01:38:26,080
if you had a huge billboard you
could place anywhere and uh,

1676
01:38:26,460 --> 01:38:27,810
you can put whatever text you want on it,

1677
01:38:28,500 --> 01:38:31,230
where would you put it
and what would it say?

1678
01:38:34,330 --> 01:38:35,163
Yeah.

1679
01:38:35,370 --> 01:38:40,060
Uh, let's see. I would put it
in New York and it would say,

1680
01:38:41,690 --> 01:38:42,160
okay,

1681
01:38:42,160 --> 01:38:45,100
do an anonymous and random
act of kindness today.

1682
01:38:47,290 --> 01:38:48,123
Why New York?

1683
01:38:50,150 --> 01:38:50,550
Okay.

1684
01:38:50,550 --> 01:38:54,100
For if, if you're giving me the constraint
of a single billboard, that's right.

1685
01:38:54,160 --> 01:38:57,640
And I want the broadest exposure I'll
get to New York where the density is

1686
01:38:57,641 --> 01:39:02,020
highest. Got It. Uh, I like it.

1687
01:39:02,140 --> 01:39:04,720
Good answer. Um, if

1688
01:39:05,890 --> 01:39:07,840
you were giving advice to your

1689
01:39:10,150 --> 01:39:14,020
30 year old self,
what advice would you give

1690
01:39:21,190 --> 01:39:22,200
that?
Um,

1691
01:39:28,480 --> 01:39:33,430
no matter what comes your way,
no matter how hard things Phil,

1692
01:39:35,860 --> 01:39:39,940
that I had the power to overcome
and be at peace with it.

1693
01:39:41,610 --> 01:39:46,440
Good advice. I think that's a great
place to, uh, to start wrapping up.

1694
01:39:46,620 --> 01:39:50,910
Is there, um, anything else you'd like to
share with the audience? Resourcefulness,

1695
01:39:50,911 --> 01:39:52,410
examples,
anything else?

1696
01:39:55,100 --> 01:39:56,780
Yeah. You know, one thing. Um,

1697
01:39:57,110 --> 01:40:01,910
so I do a lot of projects
with my kids and like,

1698
01:40:01,911 --> 01:40:02,301
for example,

1699
01:40:02,301 --> 01:40:06,920
we started a few businesses together
and we wrote a children's book together.

1700
01:40:07,640 --> 01:40:11,600
And as I think about the coming
generation of makers and doers,

1701
01:40:12,140 --> 01:40:16,370
that they're the people who will
define our world so dramatically.

1702
01:40:18,500 --> 01:40:21,620
If I think about who they aspire to be
like and what kind of things they want to

1703
01:40:21,621 --> 01:40:26,621
do and how we write the operating
systems of their app or aspirations and,

1704
01:40:27,241 --> 01:40:30,310
and endeavors, I think that, um,

1705
01:40:31,550 --> 01:40:33,980
I'm encouraged by watching
my own kids grow up,

1706
01:40:34,640 --> 01:40:39,640
that I see a bright future that we can
trust these incredibly powerful tools of

1707
01:40:40,521 --> 01:40:44,870
creation can be used for, for good things.
They go to subjective of course, but,

1708
01:40:45,410 --> 01:40:45,860
um,

1709
01:40:45,860 --> 01:40:50,860
but that we can actually change a
humanity in fundamental ways and that the

1710
01:40:51,561 --> 01:40:55,360
rising generation, if we do
it right, we'll have amazing
ability to contribute to,

1711
01:40:55,361 --> 01:40:58,600
uh, to our wellbeing.
And if, if there are,

1712
01:40:58,740 --> 01:41:03,340
and I'm sure there are new parents
listening to this, uh, and in fact,

1713
01:41:03,341 --> 01:41:06,990
I have someone I know very closely
who's about to have his first kid. Yeah.

1714
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:08,593
Um,

1715
01:41:09,370 --> 01:41:14,370
what are a few activities or experiments
or collaborations that you would

1716
01:41:17,980 --> 01:41:20,530
encourage them to have
with their kids or habits?

1717
01:41:20,590 --> 01:41:24,250
It could be anything but just general
try these two things. Three things,

1718
01:41:24,251 --> 01:41:25,870
whatever it might be with your kids.

1719
01:41:26,650 --> 01:41:31,150
It's like my personal philosophy is I
try to be relevant in my kids' lives as

1720
01:41:31,151 --> 01:41:33,130
self example. My, in my, my sixth grader,

1721
01:41:33,131 --> 01:41:35,890
he's in a public school and they don't
have any technology in the school.

1722
01:41:35,891 --> 01:41:39,070
And so I've been working with a principal
to bring technology in the school.

1723
01:41:39,071 --> 01:41:43,300
And the way we're doing it is we're
running a test in his class where they are

1724
01:41:43,301 --> 01:41:46,900
using the scientific method to say if
we bring technology in the classroom,

1725
01:41:46,901 --> 01:41:48,640
will it improve educational experience?

1726
01:41:48,790 --> 01:41:51,820
And so they have to test it out and use
pros and cons and go thought process.

1727
01:41:52,060 --> 01:41:54,820
And then each of the, then there's
six groups making a documentary.

1728
01:41:55,510 --> 01:41:59,020
And so I'm with the teacher working
with six groups of students. Yeah.

1729
01:41:59,021 --> 01:42:01,960
Six groups of students within the class
and they each are making like a three to

1730
01:42:01,961 --> 01:42:05,050
four minute documentary
on the process of testing.

1731
01:42:05,051 --> 01:42:08,320
The scientific method of does
is technology in the classroom.

1732
01:42:08,340 --> 01:42:11,110
I posit for nave experience
or what are the pros and cons.

1733
01:42:11,950 --> 01:42:15,730
And so I'm working with his teacher to
do that and doing the filmmaking and

1734
01:42:15,790 --> 01:42:18,520
plotting out the storyboarding
and identifying what the
scientific method looks

1735
01:42:18,521 --> 01:42:23,320
like. And that gives me all
these opportunities to talk
about everything that's

1736
01:42:23,321 --> 01:42:25,750
relevant in his life,
in ways that are meaningful.

1737
01:42:25,751 --> 01:42:28,330
And so when we have conversations, I'm not
just saying, hey, how's your day? Fine.

1738
01:42:28,660 --> 01:42:31,820
And that's the end of compensation,
right? But it's relevant. So, uh,

1739
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:34,450
the same is true with
my fourth grader and my,

1740
01:42:34,540 --> 01:42:37,060
and my daughter who's in preschool.

1741
01:42:37,420 --> 01:42:40,000
But I would say parents,

1742
01:42:40,001 --> 01:42:43,630
they get engaged in the children's
lives to be truly relevant,

1743
01:42:43,780 --> 01:42:47,380
to understand the underlying context
of who they like, who they dislike,

1744
01:42:47,381 --> 01:42:50,190
who are the friends, who are
the people who are, you know,

1745
01:42:50,650 --> 01:42:53,080
saying mean things to them.
What are they worried about in school?

1746
01:42:53,081 --> 01:42:54,580
So that's been a helpful my,

1747
01:42:54,630 --> 01:42:58,060
they ship with my kids and I think it's
really helped us form a very strong bond.

1748
01:42:58,990 --> 01:42:59,823
Are there any

1749
01:43:01,870 --> 01:43:06,160
traditions that you've built into
the family that are nonobvious?

1750
01:43:06,230 --> 01:43:09,010
Christmas is very common for a lot
of people of course, but are there,

1751
01:43:09,011 --> 01:43:13,760
are there any other
traditions or rituals that uh,

1752
01:43:14,020 --> 01:43:17,800
you've developed with your kids?
Yeah, so when we sit down for dinner,

1753
01:43:18,070 --> 01:43:21,400
I always have a question for
them. Like, uh, last week, uh,

1754
01:43:21,401 --> 01:43:26,401
on Saturday night we had this discussion
of what does it mean to be good?

1755
01:43:28,810 --> 01:43:32,140
And they're jamming like,
you know, it's like, uh, 11,

1756
01:43:32,230 --> 01:43:35,350
nine and five and they're jamming on this
question of what it means to be good.

1757
01:43:35,351 --> 01:43:36,640
And I raised all kinds of questions like,

1758
01:43:36,641 --> 01:43:38,730
what you think is good is not
necessarily what I think is good.

1759
01:43:38,731 --> 01:43:41,770
We have these different interpretations
and is there a single definition of good?

1760
01:43:42,460 --> 01:43:45,080
And so Mike by five-year-old's
raising her hand, offering up her in,

1761
01:43:45,081 --> 01:43:46,990
but which is amazing,
but they walk away,

1762
01:43:46,991 --> 01:43:49,810
they're surprisingly bright and
had an amazingly good insights.

1763
01:43:49,811 --> 01:43:53,780
So I tried to have these conversations
with them and sometimes it lasts like 10

1764
01:43:53,781 --> 01:43:56,120
minutes before chaos breaks
out in the house, you know.

1765
01:43:56,690 --> 01:44:01,310
But at least we have this moment
where we can connect on really serious

1766
01:44:01,311 --> 01:44:03,230
questions and they can
explore these philosophically,

1767
01:44:03,231 --> 01:44:08,120
which I have found to be beneficial
in both their development but also our

1768
01:44:08,121 --> 01:44:08,954
relationship.

1769
01:44:09,560 --> 01:44:14,560
What in your mind are common mistakes
that parents make aside from doing the

1770
01:44:15,411 --> 01:44:18,710
opposite of the two things you
just described? So we were,

1771
01:44:20,060 --> 01:44:23,200
this is up for opinion of
course, but we were at a, uh,

1772
01:44:23,210 --> 01:44:26,420
my five year old had this little party
for her preschool and I took her over and

1773
01:44:26,421 --> 01:44:30,170
we were at the park and there was this
merry go round and there was like 20 kids

1774
01:44:30,171 --> 01:44:30,771
on the merry go round.

1775
01:44:30,771 --> 01:44:33,680
It's like there was some older kids going
really fast around and like sometimes

1776
01:44:33,681 --> 01:44:36,710
a kid would fall, like fall in the
dirt and get trampled by their friends.

1777
01:44:38,040 --> 01:44:39,890
Just friends or for exactly.
So,

1778
01:44:39,891 --> 01:44:43,460
but there was like two camps of parents
and broke out. One camp was like,

1779
01:44:43,490 --> 01:44:46,940
no way is my child going to be involved
in this terribly dangerous endeavor,

1780
01:44:46,970 --> 01:44:51,350
which is a reasonable thing to say,
right? Because it's pretty dangerous.

1781
01:44:51,351 --> 01:44:52,430
And they could, someone
could, could really hurt.

1782
01:44:52,850 --> 01:44:55,940
And there are other parents more like
myself, like, look, they figure it out.

1783
01:44:55,941 --> 01:44:56,721
Like if they get hurt,

1784
01:44:56,721 --> 01:45:00,500
I'm sure that the recover and it'd be a
great experience for them to learn about,

1785
01:45:00,920 --> 01:45:03,630
about big objects moving
very fast and right.

1786
01:45:03,680 --> 01:45:07,760
These principles of physics
and the flesh. So, I mean,

1787
01:45:07,761 --> 01:45:11,090
my daughter got on and she was in
the mix of all this stuff, but um,

1788
01:45:11,091 --> 01:45:15,380
I'm certainly of the philosophy that I
like kids to go explore and do on their

1789
01:45:15,381 --> 01:45:18,800
own. And if they make mistakes, that's
fine. They can learn. But if we,

1790
01:45:19,040 --> 01:45:23,180
if there's too much inherent protection
structured that they just forego those

1791
01:45:23,181 --> 01:45:24,650
learning experiences that will,

1792
01:45:24,651 --> 01:45:28,400
they're taught that they're fragile
and I think therefore they develop the

1793
01:45:28,401 --> 01:45:31,940
belief that they're fragile. Yeah.
I mean now granted I think back to,

1794
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:35,100
I mean I'm sure you probably
have this like juke gasoline,

1795
01:45:35,840 --> 01:45:37,550
gallon of gasoline and the street example.

1796
01:45:37,550 --> 01:45:41,270
I think back to some of the stuff I did
where I'm just like I cannot believe I

1797
01:45:41,271 --> 01:45:42,790
was allowed to do that. Exactly. Yeah.

1798
01:45:42,860 --> 01:45:45,140
Skateboarding off of ramps
in the middle of the street,

1799
01:45:45,141 --> 01:45:48,830
wear like flip over and smashed my head
on the asphalt and Cognac hus myself.

1800
01:45:48,860 --> 01:45:50,970
Exactly. She's like, oh my God. But yeah,

1801
01:45:51,590 --> 01:45:56,100
all of those things taught
me ultimately like the,

1802
01:45:56,390 --> 01:45:59,600
either this too shall pass or like okay,

1803
01:45:59,630 --> 01:46:01,760
like you earned your lumps
now you know not to do that.

1804
01:46:01,761 --> 01:46:02,690
But you also know like you,

1805
01:46:02,810 --> 01:46:05,960
you were able to weather the storm
and get through it. Exactly. Yeah.

1806
01:46:05,961 --> 01:46:08,000
So we got an a four
wheeler, uh, two weeks ago,

1807
01:46:08,030 --> 01:46:10,760
my 11 and nine year olds and I said,
okay, I'm going to put your helmets on.

1808
01:46:10,761 --> 01:46:14,060
I'm going to give you a two
minute lesson on how to go,

1809
01:46:14,090 --> 01:46:16,490
how to go forward and how to go backwards,
how to break.

1810
01:46:16,790 --> 01:46:19,250
I'm to give you some lessons,
like don't go into a ditch,

1811
01:46:19,490 --> 01:46:22,330
don't go on a hillside though.
You'll turn over.

1812
01:46:22,730 --> 01:46:26,630
But I'm an expecting you to now go out
for five minutes and come back safely and

1813
01:46:26,631 --> 01:46:29,120
tell me how you did it.
Like what were your thought processes?

1814
01:46:29,121 --> 01:46:31,040
How'd you stay safe for the risk you took?

1815
01:46:31,400 --> 01:46:33,260
But I want them to do it and
I'm not going with you. Right?

1816
01:46:33,261 --> 01:46:35,750
So you go and come back and
they came back in one piece.

1817
01:46:36,230 --> 01:46:38,690
But it was a good experience for
them to tell me like, look, Hey dad,

1818
01:46:38,691 --> 01:46:40,040
this is how we looked at the risk.

1819
01:46:40,310 --> 01:46:42,500
This is how we thought that we'd
potentially going to get into a problem.

1820
01:46:42,501 --> 01:46:46,550
They ran into a tree going
slowly, but right. What they
talked about it, which was,

1821
01:46:46,551 --> 01:46:49,410
I thought it was really
helpful. Well, you know, and uh,

1822
01:46:50,130 --> 01:46:50,570
yeah,

1823
01:46:50,570 --> 01:46:52,730
I just think it's,
I think you're a fascinating guy.

1824
01:46:52,731 --> 01:46:54,200
I think you're very inspiring guy.

1825
01:46:54,201 --> 01:46:57,490
And as I think forward to at
someday having kids myself, I,

1826
01:46:57,491 --> 01:47:01,920
I love asking you these
types of questions and uh,

1827
01:47:03,490 --> 01:47:08,140
this has been a blast. So number one,
thank you very much for taking the time.

1828
01:47:08,500 --> 01:47:10,180
I always love having these conversations.

1829
01:47:10,181 --> 01:47:13,090
This is our first one on
the record and a second,

1830
01:47:13,091 --> 01:47:17,080
where can people learn more about you,
about the [inaudible] fund and so on.

1831
01:47:17,610 --> 01:47:21,580
Ios fund.co cl is where
all of our investments are.

1832
01:47:22,090 --> 01:47:24,310
And um,
I'm active on Twitter,

1833
01:47:24,311 --> 01:47:28,600
so happy to have ongoing discussions
about the various things we talked about.

1834
01:47:28,601 --> 01:47:33,430
But what's your Twitter handle? Uh, Brian
Underscore Johnson with a y. Got it.

1835
01:47:34,390 --> 01:47:38,200
At Brian and Square Johnson. I'll put
that in the show notes as well. Uh, any,

1836
01:47:38,260 --> 01:47:41,470
any parting thoughts or comments? Now,
Tim, I just love this. I mean, we've,

1837
01:47:41,471 --> 01:47:44,980
we've had fantastic conversations,
you know, uh, over time.

1838
01:47:44,981 --> 01:47:49,240
So this is fun to actually do this.
I'm formally and, uh, you know,

1839
01:47:49,241 --> 01:47:52,090
I've really enjoyed the friendship.
Likewise man. And this is a,

1840
01:47:52,091 --> 01:47:54,190
it's I'm so glad that I was able to,
uh,

1841
01:47:54,790 --> 01:47:58,910
to try to give people a view into
these conversations that we have a,

1842
01:47:58,960 --> 01:48:02,230
it's so much fun for me and I always
come away with a bunch of things that I

1843
01:48:02,231 --> 01:48:04,330
want to try or a bunch of
assumptions I want to test.

1844
01:48:04,330 --> 01:48:09,330
And I think you really good at not only
helping to prepare people for what could

1845
01:48:11,891 --> 01:48:15,700
be a very glorious future of
sort of infinite creation,

1846
01:48:15,970 --> 01:48:20,500
but also giving them the belief in the
first place that is possible. And so, uh,

1847
01:48:20,720 --> 01:48:23,680
I really believe that
you're a force for good.

1848
01:48:23,681 --> 01:48:25,840
So thank you for spreading

1849
01:48:26,330 --> 01:48:27,163
mmm.

1850
01:48:28,300 --> 01:48:31,240
Confidence, uh, in, in the
world. And I think you're,

1851
01:48:31,270 --> 01:48:33,490
you're trying to really
leave set and sort of a,

1852
01:48:33,790 --> 01:48:36,730
a dent in the universe and an impact.
So thank you my friend.

1853
01:48:36,740 --> 01:48:38,860
Appreciate that a lot. I
appreciate it. So to be continued,

1854

graphic design related.

1867
01:49:21,160 --> 01:49:26,160
I've used 99 designs for everything
from banner ads to book covers,

1868
01:49:26,171 --> 01:49:29,860
including sketches and mock ups
that led to the four hour body,

1869
01:49:29,861 --> 01:49:32,320
which later became number one
New York Times Number One,

1870
01:49:32,321 --> 01:49:34,660
Wall Street Journal and the brainstorming.

1871
01:49:34,690 --> 01:49:37,450
A lot of it took place with
designers from around the world.

1872
01:49:37,510 --> 01:49:42,220
And here's how it works. Whether you need
a t shirt, a business card, a website,

1873
01:49:42,600 --> 01:49:44,770
an APP thumbnail,
whatever it might be.

1874
01:49:45,010 --> 01:49:49,930
You submit that project and from around
the world we'll send you sketches and

1875
01:49:49,931 --> 01:49:51,160
mock ups and designs.

1876
01:49:51,400 --> 01:49:54,850

original that you love or you get your

1877
01:49:54,851 --> 01:49:55,510
money back.

1878
01:49:55,510 --> 01:49:59,290
It's that straightforward and many of you
who are listening have already used it

1879
01:49:59,291 --> 01:50:01,780
and created some amazing things that
I'll be sharing it in the future.

Tim,

1884
01:50:17,350 --> 01:50:21,400
this episode is brought to you by
Athletic Greens. I get asked all the time,

1885
01:50:21,401 --> 01:50:23,590
if you could only use one supplement,
what would it be?

1886
01:50:23,870 --> 01:50:26,500
And my answer is
inevitably Athletic Greens,

1887
01:50:26,501 --> 01:50:28,990
it is your all in one
nutritional insurance.

1888
01:50:28,991 --> 01:50:30,730
I recommended it in the four hour body,

1889
01:50:30,790 --> 01:50:34,750
did not get paid for that and I
travel with it to avoid getting sick.

1890
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:37,780
I take it in the mornings to
ensure optimal performance.

1891
01:50:37,990 --> 01:50:39,250
It just covers all my basis.

1892
01:50:39,280 --> 01:50:43,270
If I can't get what I need through whole
food meals throughout the rest of the

1893
01:50:43,270 --> 01:50:48,100
day, and you can get 50 oh my
gosh, 50% off. Yes, 50% off.

1894

It's tasty, but more important.

1896

It will help you not screw up when
you're doing your nutritional plannings.

1897
01:51:02,171 --> 01:51:05,710
For me, it just covers the
basis, takes a load off my mind,

1898
01:51:05,740 --> 01:51:08,470
puts a lot in my buddy and check it out.
