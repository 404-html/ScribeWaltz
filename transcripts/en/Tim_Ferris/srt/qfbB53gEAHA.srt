1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,230
Hey guys,
Tim Ferriss here.

2
00:00:01,231 --> 00:00:04,830
I'm going to talk a little bit about
what my breakfast might look like,

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,300
which isn't always a breakfast.

4
00:00:06,301 --> 00:00:08,160
So I do experiment with
intermittent fast and quite a bit,

5
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:13,170
but this is kind of the basic lineup
and very typically if I'm say doing some

6
00:00:13,171 --> 00:00:15,840
form of athletic training at 10:00 AM.

7
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:19,620
So I'm doing technical training right
now with gymnastics effectively at 10:00

8
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:20,730
AM then a train again in the union.

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,480
I will not have a large breakfast
but I will have a number of things.

10
00:00:26,641 --> 00:00:29,880
The first is some form of ketone,

11
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:35,090
so synthetic or exogenous ketone or I
will have MCT oil which is converted very

12
00:00:37,111 --> 00:00:41,610
readily into ketones by the liver.
So we have a couple of options here.

13
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,510
This is one, this is Quito
force from Quito sports. Uh,

14
00:00:45,511 --> 00:00:49,890
this was introduced to me by Dominic
D'agostino scientists quite a while back,

15
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,780
but also a developed or could develop by
Patrick Arnold who is very world famous

16
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,040
black market biochemist.
Some might say, uh,

17
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:03,110
for performance enhancing compounds and
a key to force as well as even MCT oil.

18
00:01:03,631 --> 00:01:07,590
And this is just, this is brain octane,
which is easy to find by bulletproof,

19
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:10,500
but there are many different types
is effectively caprylic acid,

20
00:01:10,501 --> 00:01:15,390
c eight and you can find different
types. Perillo also has one. And uh,

21
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,490
this type of ketone accomplishes
a few things. Uh, in,

22
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,110
in my research based one I've seen it
can decrease the speed of tumor growth

23
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,360
even if you're consuming,
uh,

24
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,720
what you might consider a
Gluco genic foods, right?

25
00:01:30,721 --> 00:01:35,160
So if you're eating a
carbohydrate inclusive diet
or co carbohydrate based diet,

26
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:39,490
these can still have an effect also
decreases oxygen requirements. Uh,

27
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,930
for endurance work has some
applications to anaerobic work.

28
00:01:42,931 --> 00:01:46,290
So I will very typically have say three
capsules of this with a little bit of

29
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:49,520
lemon juice cause it's very,
very alkaline in water, right?

30
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:50,520
So it'd be option number one.

31
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:54,960
Option number two would be
say a capful of the c eight.

32
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,660
This is something you
want to work up to a,

33
00:01:57,661 --> 00:02:01,470
otherwise you will get disaster
pants. So really work your way up. Uh,

34
00:02:01,471 --> 00:02:03,330
the next is,
uh,

35
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,250
I will sometimes have a protein shake
in the mornings and it is currently

36
00:02:08,251 --> 00:02:12,480
composed of this.
So we have terrorists way,

37
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,800
which is a goat whey protein unflavored.
I can stomach unflavored whey protein.

38
00:02:16,801 --> 00:02:21,510
Not Everybody can. I will very often
combine that with this gelatin.

39
00:02:21,511 --> 00:02:22,920
So Great Lakes Gelatin,

40
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,780
which is a Collagen hydrolysate
thump announcing that correctly.

41
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:30,270
I don't know, but I've read it
a lot. Haven't said it much.

42
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,340
This was introduced to me by Amelia Boone,

43
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,700
the world's most successful
female obstacle course racer.

44
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,090
I had an orange,
a jar version of this,

45
00:02:39,091 --> 00:02:43,200
which is not a hydrolyzed and it's
disgusting. It doesn't mix well.

46
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:47,600
This mixes very easily
in cold or hot water. Uh,

47
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,310
so this however also tastes
a bit like cow hooves.

48
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:54,330
So I will combine the goat whey
protein to be two scoops of this,

49
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,520
a few tablespoons of the Collagen,

50
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:01,090
and then I will use a
tablespoon of the super beets,

51
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,560
which is the same as beat elite.
So they are,

52
00:03:03,561 --> 00:03:07,420
they're the same product effectively.
So super beets or beat elite,

53
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:12,340
which has the added benefit of
some potential endurance, uh,

54
00:03:12,341 --> 00:03:16,330
improvements. And I've written about
this on the blog before for our blog.com.

55
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:21,300
Uh, and if, uh, for for maybe
10% of the guys out there,

56
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:25,990
we'll have a very small but
noticeable Viagara like effect.

57
00:03:25,991 --> 00:03:28,270
So you have that going to run
around the gym with a big boner.

58
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,990
Maybe this is good insurance to
have in your morning kit. Uh,

59
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:36,640
then we have the last piece of
this is a very consistently tea.

60
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:40,480
So I tend to brew tea along
these lines. I use this, this,

61
00:03:40,481 --> 00:03:43,090
this Cuisinart kettle there many
electric kettles you can use.

62
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,600
I typically set it to
one 85 is my default,

63
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,980
but you have one 75 for green,
one 85 for white, one 94 Ulaan,

64
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,680
uh, 200 for French press, et Cetera.

65
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,860
But I will combine very often
this currently Ascensia in it.

66
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:01,480
And this is kind of my secret closet here.
Not so secret,

67
00:04:01,481 --> 00:04:06,340
but it has two drawers
lest I mixed them up.

68
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:09,550
This is decaf. Uh, so I have white sage,

69
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:14,000
I have Douglas Fir,
Chai, Roy bus, et cetera.

70
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,450
And then I have all of
my caffeinated options,

71
00:04:16,451 --> 00:04:19,510
which would include the
cub would say Sencha,

72
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,790
which is what I currently have in there.

73
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:26,200
And this was also a gift from Japan.

74
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:31,650
And then, uh, and this will be sacrilege,
do a lot of folks out there. Uh,

75
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,740
I will have some type
of poo air or oolong.

76
00:04:35,741 --> 00:04:38,780
This is a roasted oolong tea.
Uh,

77
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,660
and I will just drop in,

78
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,610
really eyeball it.
And again,

79
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,340
there are purists who would just
be disgusted with this approach,

80
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,080
but I'm not a purist.

81
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:55,090
So there you have it and I'll drop this
in and the first step is generally very,

82
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,050
very short,

83
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,590
but I will leave it in there for
probably a good minute because one of my

84
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:04,591
objectives is getting the catechins
and caffeine and so on that is in here,

85
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:09,610
the theophylline, which is one of the
stimulus and green tea, et cetera.

86
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:14,940
And this also combines very nicely
with this or some type of butter.

87
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,330
So I will occasionally use

88
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:26,170
Kerrygold butter, uh, in t after I
have poured it into some type of Mug.

89
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,010
And that is effectively
the most basic breakfast.

90
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:35,280
But what I have noticed is that I perform
best when I have a little bit of food.

91
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:40,630
And this right here is wild planet
sardines packed in olive oil. So I,

92
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:45,631
we'll drizzle some of this olive oil on
my dog's food and then I will eat the

93
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:47,800
rest and including the oil.

94
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:53,220
And that is effectively right now my
micro breakfast kit as you see it here.

95
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:57,040
There are other times if I'm trying to
increase muscle mass substantially for

96
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:02,180
where I will have a very typical slow
carb breakfast with lots of eggs,

97
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:06,350
lentils, spinach, and whatnot.
But this is another alternative.

98
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:11,660
Have you heard of five bullet Friday?
Well, if you haven't, that's good news.

99
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:15,410
I'm excited because it is
my most exclusive content.
