1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,990
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02,991 --> 00:00:07,110
I can run flat out for a half mile before
my hands start shaking familiar else

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:07,983
you posted a question.

4
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,590
I'm a cybernetic organism living tissue.

5
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:27,870
This episode is brought to you by Linkedin
and their job recruitment platform,

6
00:00:27,871 --> 00:00:32,820
which offers a smarter system for the
hiring process if you've ever hired anyone

7
00:00:32,821 --> 00:00:33,660
or attempted to do it,

8
00:00:33,661 --> 00:00:38,070
you know that finding the right people
can be extremely difficult and if you

9
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:40,230
don't have a direct referral
from someone you trust,

10
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,820
you're left to use job boards that don't
really offer any real world networking

11
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,720
approach. And when I mean by
that is in contrast, Linkedin,

12
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:51,030
which is the world's largest
professional network,

13
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,720
has a built in ecosystem that allows
you to not only search for employees but

14
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:59,370
also interact with them and their
connections and their former employers or

15
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,240
colleagues in a way that closely
mimics real life communication.

16
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:08,570
More than 70% of the workforce in the u
s uses Linkedin and more than 22 million

17
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,360
professionals view and apply
to linkedin every single week.

18
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:15,810
Unlike generic job boards,
linkedin considers skills,

19
00:01:15,811 --> 00:01:17,850
experience and location to
match you with candidates,

20
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,380
making it easier to find
quality candidates. And uh,

21
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,140
maybe above all you can directly
contact, uh, candidates,

22
00:01:25,141 --> 00:01:29,520
connections to get a good sense of if
they are a good fit for your business.

26
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:48,650
This episode is brought to you by
Ray Daleo, his new book principles.

27
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,720
If you're a frequent
listener of this podcast,

28
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,980
you might recall that ray
was a guest on the show.

29
00:01:52,981 --> 00:01:57,020
Has episode was extremely popular and in
that episode he shared his thoughts and

30
00:01:57,021 --> 00:02:01,730
everything from how he makes investment
decisions to cryptocurrency and beyond

31
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:06,590
his story. Ray Daleo, you should
look him up for sure is fascinating.

32
00:02:06,591 --> 00:02:09,800
He started his investment company.
Some people would call it a hedge fund.

33
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:10,970
There are different names.

34
00:02:10,971 --> 00:02:14,780
Bridgewater associates out of a
two bedroom apartment at each 26.

35
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,200
Now it has roughly $160 billion in
assets under management over 42 years.

36
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:25,160
He's built Bridgewater into what fortune
considers the fifth most important

37
00:02:25,161 --> 00:02:28,130
private company in the u s along the way,

38
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:33,770
Daleo took tons and tons of notes
on what worked, what didn't work,

39
00:02:33,771 --> 00:02:38,540
and it was refined over time for
training purposes with his employees,

40
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,800
managers and so on.

41
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,170
Daleo became one of the
100 most influential people
in the world according to

42
00:02:45,171 --> 00:02:48,920
time and one of the 100 wealthiest
people in the world. According to Forbes.

43
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:49,971
In this book,

44
00:02:49,971 --> 00:02:54,830
principles which has a permanent spot
on my bookshelf also has blurbs and

45
00:02:54,831 --> 00:02:58,880
testimonials from people like Bill Gates,
Michael Bloomberg, and many, many more.

46
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,060
Ray shares in those pages,

47
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,660
the unconventional principles that he's
developed or find and use over the past

48
00:03:04,661 --> 00:03:09,661
40 years to create unique
results in both life business,

49
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:14,680
certainly in investing and which any
person or organization can adopt to help

50
00:03:14,681 --> 00:03:16,000
further their goals.

51
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,930
These principles are what he believes
is the reason behind his many,

52
00:03:19,931 --> 00:03:22,990
many successes and principles.

53
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:25,060
The book also offers a clear,

54
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:28,720
very straight forward approach to decision
making that Dhalia believes anyone

55
00:03:28,721 --> 00:03:32,860
can apply both in life and work.
I highly, highly recommend it.

56
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,970
It will help you to become
in almost any context,

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,410
a clearer thinker.

Hello Ladies and gentlemen,
this is Tim Ferriss.

63
00:03:58,731 --> 00:04:00,890
Welcome to another episode
of the Tim Ferriss show.

64
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:06,520
More specifically another edition of the
Tim Ferriss radio hour where I go back

65
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,760
through the 300 plus guests
who've been on this show.

66
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:15,800
Think about the conversations and look
for patterns or themes that we can

67
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:20,300
explore and this episode
we'll dig into travel.

68
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:25,301
One of my favorite topics and I will take
partial credit or blame in advance as

69
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:28,660
it might make you want to quit your
job and head off to the airport with a

70
00:04:28,661 --> 00:04:29,494
backpack.

71
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,840
Coincidentally exactly what I am doing
tomorrow and why I'm recording this intro

72
00:04:34,851 --> 00:04:36,950
way,
way past midnight now.

73
00:04:36,951 --> 00:04:39,770
I've interviewed some fascinating
people from around the world.

74
00:04:39,771 --> 00:04:44,270
It's kind of crazy to think that this is
my job. How happy am I? How lucky am I?

75
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:46,130
And in the next hour,

76
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,550
we will actually travel around
the world with them in a way,

77
00:04:49,551 --> 00:04:52,430
because we recorded these
episodes all over the planet.

78
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:56,180
We'll also explore specific tips and
strategies from our conversations related

79
00:04:56,181 --> 00:04:59,240
to how they think about travel,
how they personally travel,

80
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:03,860
the tools and gadgets they use, and the
role that travel might play in your life.

81
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:08,240
First I talked to the one and only
Rolf Potts, the author of vagabonding,

82
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,370
one of my favorite books of all time.

83
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:15,260
Some of you may know starting around
2004 I traveled the world for roughly 18

84
00:05:15,261 --> 00:05:19,910
months after this complete implosion
and deciding to either shut my business

85
00:05:19,911 --> 00:05:23,090
down or completely reinvented
and extricate myself.

86
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:28,400
The lessons learned over those 18 months
form the basis for much of my first

87
00:05:28,401 --> 00:05:30,620
book,
the four hour workweek on that journey,

88
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:35,630
which ranged from the back alleys
of Berlin to lakes and Patagonia.

89
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:39,830
I had next to nothing, one suitcase,
one backpack, and only two books.

90
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:45,140
One of those books was Walden by Henry
David Thoreau naturally and the other was

91
00:05:45,141 --> 00:05:49,730
vagabonding subtitle and uncommon guide
to the art of longterm world travel

92
00:05:49,731 --> 00:05:50,690
written by Rolf Potts,

93
00:05:50,691 --> 00:05:55,410
which is about a lot more than
just travel people, you know,

94
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:58,160
they put off what they really
want to until they're too old

95
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,670
to actually write,

96
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,710
do it next.

97
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:04,430
My friend Kevin Rose and I share our
travel experiences while sitting on Tatami

98
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:09,200
mats in a traditional, in the Japanese
hillside in Kanazawa specifically,

99
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,190
and we cover everything from how to cope
when not speaking the local language to

100
00:06:13,191 --> 00:06:17,240
how Kevin has to hide his tattoos,
those tattoos in certain countries,

101
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:21,020
including Japan,
went in to use the spa and she goes,

102
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,120
tattoos and I said yes,

103
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:27,140
and she handed me flesh colored tape.

104
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:32,450
Then I talk travel and diving adventures
among other things with Phil Cogan from

105
00:06:32,451 --> 00:06:37,040
the amazing race and I just wrote down
everything that I felt like I had all the

106
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:41,300
time in the world to do, to get out, to
go, okay, this is not a dress rehearsal.

107
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:45,110
You can die, you will die. You don't
know how long you've got before you die.

108
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:47,900
And of course the incredible.

109
00:06:47,901 --> 00:06:51,800
Kevin Kelly and I get into our
favorite travel tools and gadgets.

110
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,870
What else do you have in your backpack,

111
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:56,150
which is stuffed here in the
back of our car right now?

112
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,620
So let's jump right in.

113
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:05,710
Rolf Potts at Rolf Potts on Twitter has
reported for more than 60 countries for

114
00:07:05,961 --> 00:07:08,660
the likes of National Geographic Traveler,
the New Yorker,

115
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:12,140
slate.com outside the New York
Times magazine, the believer,

116
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:15,830
it goes on and on and on.
Sports illustrated, national
public radio, you name it,

117
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,090
his adventures have taken him across
six continents and include piloting a

118
00:07:20,091 --> 00:07:25,091
fishing boat 900 miles down the Laotian
or Laotian metcon hitchhiking across

119
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:29,750
eastern Europe, traversing Israel
on foot, bicycling across Burma,

120
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:34,880
driving a land rover across South America.
Sounds like a long, long ass trip.

121
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:39,880
And traveling around the world for six
weeks with no luggage or bags of any kind

122
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:44,390
off is perhaps best known for promoting
the ethic of independent travel and his

123
00:07:44,391 --> 00:07:47,090
book on the subject of vagabonding,
which I mentioned before,

124
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:49,520
subtitle an uncommon guide
to the art of longterm.

125
00:07:49,521 --> 00:07:54,050
We'll travel has been through 28 printings
and translated into many languages.

126
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:56,210
It is also,
by the way,

127
00:07:56,211 --> 00:08:00,920
the reason I started the Tim Ferriss Book
Club and produce an audio book of this

128
00:08:00,921 --> 00:08:02,450
book because it could not be found in.

129
00:08:02,451 --> 00:08:06,800
That bothered me when you can find out
all about that@audible.com forward slash

130
00:08:06,801 --> 00:08:10,830
Tim's books if you want to see the other
books in that selection. But backdrop,

131
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:15,470
he won the 2009 Lowell Thomas Award from
the Society of American travel writers

132
00:08:15,471 --> 00:08:19,840
and became the first American author to
when Italy's prestigious coveted Chatwin

133
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:24,350
prize for travel writing.
Many people fantasize about travel,

134
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,700
yet they never follow through.

135
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:28,850
They never the book their trip
and take those first steps.

136
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:33,880
Ralf explains in what follows the concept
of vagabonding and how it differs from

137
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:35,870
just another vacation.

138
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:44,490
I like that you bring up the idea of
fantasizing about travel because I think

139
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:48,150
it's something that everybody does
and it's one of those top three,

140
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:52,440
if not top two or one things that people
dream about that and you and you see it

141
00:08:52,441 --> 00:08:56,310
in the movies all the time. Um, and in
fact, I this in vagabonding, you know,

142
00:08:56,311 --> 00:09:01,230
the heist movie where the whole goal
is to have this complicated, um,

143
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:05,340
robbery so they can have enough money to,
to move overseas to a wonderful place.

144
00:09:05,341 --> 00:09:07,680
And as I say in the book, is that you
don't need to rob a bank to do that.

145
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:12,210
In fact, you can do that
for a cost that is equal to,

146
00:09:12,211 --> 00:09:16,650
and sometimes less than your cost of
living in a major American city. Uh,

147
00:09:16,651 --> 00:09:21,651
and so I think an important principle
I bring up in vagabonding is saying,

148
00:09:22,081 --> 00:09:25,890
don't, don't put this off if you're
dreaming about travel. And most people do.

149
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,140
And you know, and if you don't
worry about travel, that's fine.

150
00:09:28,141 --> 00:09:30,390
But I really address these travel dreams,

151
00:09:30,391 --> 00:09:34,530
which are so common that don't wait until
you get to tell you're too old because,

152
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:39,030
um, you know, retirement isn't
necessarily the best time to, to, uh,

153
00:09:39,031 --> 00:09:42,660
to do something like this. And
in fact, a Henry David Thoreau,

154
00:09:42,661 --> 00:09:45,750
I think Walden Woods, the other book
you'd, you took on your travels, uh,

155
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,340
talks about how people, and I'm not
quoting him directly, they, you know,

156
00:09:50,341 --> 00:09:54,090
they put off what they really want to do
until they're too old to actually do it.

157
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:59,070
And you know, that's a paraphrase.
Um, and so if you are 18, 28,

158
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,600
you know, 38, 48, whenever
you're them about travel, put,

159
00:10:03,601 --> 00:10:05,380
make your goals soon and,

160
00:10:05,381 --> 00:10:09,240
and don't put off those goals because
they're very attainable. And you know,

161
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:14,241
I think there's a lot of fears that
are tied in to confronting vagabonding,

162
00:10:15,151 --> 00:10:17,040
which you asked me if the,
for the definition,

163
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:20,460
it's not combining as longterm travel.
It's not just a vacation,

164
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,380
it's not a week or two off. Um, that, you
know, society gives you as a vacation.

165
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:29,100
It's six months or two
years or s you know,

166
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:32,370
six weeks that you make for
yourself to travel in earnest,

167
00:10:32,371 --> 00:10:36,360
not as a consumer experience, not
as a vacation, but as a, you know,

168
00:10:36,361 --> 00:10:39,240
a more deeply meaningful life experience.

169
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,940
And as a way to actualize
your wealth of time.

170
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:44,820
And I think this is an idea we'll come
back to a lot and it's something that you

171
00:10:44,821 --> 00:10:47,250
write about as well as me
as the idea of time wealth,

172
00:10:47,251 --> 00:10:50,970
the idea that your experiences
are more valuable in life.

173
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Then the things that you accumulate and
the things that are always being touted

174
00:10:56,101 --> 00:10:57,630
as the most important things in life.

175
00:10:57,631 --> 00:11:02,550
So travel is a great way to cash
in on your time wealth. Um, and,

176
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:06,000
and vagabonding just by definition
is a more meaningful way of travel.

177
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,440
It's a way of slowing down and really
discovering parts of yourself instead of

178
00:11:10,441 --> 00:11:12,540
just buying a lot of experiences,
which is,

179
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:17,040
which we've sort of been conditioned
to do, uh, as American consumers.

180
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:21,270
My first vagabonding trip was
20 years ago this year. Um,

181
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,990
oddly enough and having an
anniversary. Thank you. Thank you.

182
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,030
It was just this time that I was,

183
00:11:27,031 --> 00:11:30,720
that I was straggling back to Kansas
after having this amazing eight month trip

184
00:11:30,721 --> 00:11:34,200
around North America and it was a
trip that I thought would be my last,

185
00:11:34,201 --> 00:11:37,260
I thought I would get travel out of my
system so I could become a responsible

186
00:11:37,261 --> 00:11:42,030
American workaholic. And then maybe
return to travel when I was old. But you,

187
00:11:42,031 --> 00:11:46,860
you mentioned the idea of fear and
the fears I had going out were,

188
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:50,220
um, you know, is this going to
be expensive? It's going to,

189
00:11:50,221 --> 00:11:51,630
is this going to be dangerous,

190
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:55,210
am going to come back and be
compromised professionally.

191
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,120
And all of those sort of turned into the,

192
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:01,960
into the opposite that it was
a lot safer than I expected.

193
00:12:01,961 --> 00:12:03,580
It was a lot cheaper than I expected.

194
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:08,650
And I came back and for 20 years I've
been integrating, uh, travel, uh, with,

195
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:13,630
with a professional life that continues
to diversify. I continue to, to,

196
00:12:13,631 --> 00:12:18,370
to do other things to make money while
at the same time having big swaths of

197
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:21,910
time to travel. And I'm not suggesting
that everybody needs to, you know,

198
00:12:21,911 --> 00:12:24,550
become a vagabond or for a 20 year chunk.

199
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:27,910
And in some ways I travel a lot
less than I used to, um, you know,

200
00:12:27,911 --> 00:12:31,000
10 or 15 years ago.
But it's something that you can do.

201
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:33,700
It's an option that you can
have and it's not an APP,

202
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:37,480
an option that you wait for life
to give you, you create it. Uh,

203
00:12:37,481 --> 00:12:40,310
and so I'm a big believer in the active,
uh,

204
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:43,720
aspect of vagabonding
of saving your money.

205
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,250
But the lottery is another
metaphor I use a lot in,

206
00:12:46,251 --> 00:12:50,630
in bag of bonding that people keep waiting
for the lottery to reward them. Um,

207
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:51,760
but as,
as we all know,

208
00:12:51,761 --> 00:12:54,040
the odds that you're going to
win the lottery is pretty low.

209
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,780
But we've already won the lottery.

210
00:12:55,781 --> 00:12:59,710
We're born with time wealth and so it's
just a matter of creating these travel

211
00:12:59,711 --> 00:13:04,180
experiences or these time
rich experiences, uh,

212
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:06,400
through things like simplicity and a,

213
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:09,070
just the decision to make
these sort of things happen.

214
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:14,400
What type of sites or resources would
you recommend to people who are trying to

215
00:13:15,251 --> 00:13:17,920
find a comparable folks?

216
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:22,450
Let's just say people who will help them
alleviate their fear of travel or just

217
00:13:22,451 --> 00:13:25,930
in general, what type of online
resources do you recommend?

218
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:31,690
Um, well Google for one. I mean
if you just Google, you know,

219
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:36,310
35 year old years old, two
kids, one year of travel,

220
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:40,570
then odds are you'll find 20 blogs of
people in that demographic who are doing

221
00:13:40,571 --> 00:13:42,820
just that. Um, so,

222
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:47,821
so really be the unabashed and very
specific about googling you know,

223
00:13:48,971 --> 00:13:53,610
your fears or your demographic
and just see who like you is,

224
00:13:53,611 --> 00:13:56,770
is out traveling the world. There's
a lot of great traveler communities.

225
00:13:56,771 --> 00:14:00,190
I've been affiliated with
boots and all.com, um,

226
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:05,250
since the very beginning of vagabonding
and part of their emo is just sort of

227
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:10,480
creating community and, and
uh, and, and support, uh,

228
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:11,650
for people.
And they have,

229
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:15,160
they have blogs and resources on their
site and there's other travel communities

230
00:14:15,161 --> 00:14:20,020
as well. It's boots, the
letter n all.com, right? Yeah.

231
00:14:20,021 --> 00:14:23,170
B O t s n a l l.com.

232
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,050
And they'd been operating out of Portland,
Oregon for years.

233
00:14:26,051 --> 00:14:28,730
And I'm just quietly been doing very well.

234
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:33,730
The nice work of reassurance
and saying, oh, so you, so
you're worried about it. Uh,

235
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,470
and around the world
flight, well, here's what,

236
00:14:35,471 --> 00:14:38,130
around how around the world
flights. Look, you know, you're,

237
00:14:38,131 --> 00:14:40,720
you're worried about a certain
situation, you know, here's,

238
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:44,230
here are some resources for
that. And, and they're not alone.

239
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,780
I'm most familiar with them because we,
we've been,

240
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,480
we've sort of shared a similar
mission for a long time,

241
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:54,170
but there are big communities of
travelers who, who are happy to help,

242
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:58,620
uh, and, and sort of help new
newbies feel better about these, uh,

243
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,350
prospects have of longterm travel

244
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:04,870
for you in,
and perhaps there are older examples,

245
00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:06,890
but you mentioned that
you're, uh, you're too,

246
00:15:06,891 --> 00:15:09,390
you're taking a trip before
we started recording, uh,

247
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:12,280
and you're doing a home swap. Is that, is,

248
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,120
would you mind perhaps elaborating on,
um,

249
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:20,260
how some of those options work,
those that you're familiar with,

250
00:15:20,261 --> 00:15:24,880
because I think that many people who
consider travel think in terms of one of

251
00:15:24,881 --> 00:15:29,710
their main expenses being, staying
in a hotel. Right. Uh, and,

252
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,770
uh, I'd love for you to share
any of your thoughts on that.

253
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,810
Yeah. Well, it, it's shifted the
way the travel world works in, in,

254
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:40,500
in some ways that are delightfully
convenient. Uh, and, and,

255
00:15:40,501 --> 00:15:42,500
and in some ways that are
a little bit strange. I,

256
00:15:42,501 --> 00:15:46,380
I think that technology is one of those
double edged swords that in some ways

257
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:50,640
has turned us into insufferable
micromanagers on the road.

258
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,680
Can you elaborate on that?

259
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,990
Yeah. Well, I'll, I'll start with
the negative. Um, you know, I,

260
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,210
I the tribal culture which I started in,
which was 20 years ago,

261
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:07,100
but really my more international traveler
travels or more like 15 years ago. Um,

262
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:11,570
it's about showing up in town and
knowing that when you get there, um,

263
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,820
the unexpected awaits you that you,

264
00:16:13,821 --> 00:16:15,620
that you're going to walk
to the hotel district,

265
00:16:15,621 --> 00:16:19,170
you may have a guidebook with
some hotel recommendations. Um,

266
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:22,010
but you're going to shop for your hotel.
You're not gonna find a deal online.

267
00:16:22,011 --> 00:16:24,780
You're going to walk in there,
you're going to see the room. Um,

268
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,490
you're going to haggle because in,
in, in all throughout Asia, you know,

269
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:32,900
basically any place outside of the
industrial world, prices are up for grabs.

270
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,270
And haggling in person is so much more,

271
00:16:35,271 --> 00:16:37,850
it gives you so much more
leverage than haggling online.

272
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:42,200
Cause you can go and look at the room
and physically leave, uh, if the,

273
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:44,870
if the owner doesn't give you a
price that you're, that you're into.

274
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:50,360
And so these days it has become so
convenient. Not always a bad thing,

275
00:16:50,361 --> 00:16:54,710
but it has become so convenient that
people just assume that the best deals to

276
00:16:54,711 --> 00:16:56,240
be had are the ones online.

277
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,780
And then pretty soon you've locked in
your traveling for six weeks and you know

278
00:16:59,781 --> 00:17:02,090
where you're sleeping
every night and advanced.

279
00:17:02,091 --> 00:17:06,590
And it really compromises the flexibility
of travel and the serendipity of being

280
00:17:06,591 --> 00:17:11,090
inspired by a place and thinking, I'm
going to stay here for a few days. Or Wow,

281
00:17:11,091 --> 00:17:14,030
I just met this traveler who told me
about this great place up in the mountains

282
00:17:14,031 --> 00:17:16,790
and I'm,
I'm not going to go to Varanasi,

283
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:19,310
I'm going to go up into the
Himalayas and spend my time there.

284
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:25,570
This technologically enhanced micro
managing cuts into that serendipity in a

285
00:17:26,361 --> 00:17:30,830
certain way. And it also
connects us to home and, and
again, it's a two edge thing.

286
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:32,650
Um,
social media and the,

287
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,690
and the constant connectivity that
comes with smartphones, for example,

288
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:38,900
allows us to really find things
that we couldn't find before.

289
00:17:38,901 --> 00:17:43,901
But it cuts into the idea of wandering
around and finding things by surprise,

290
00:17:44,091 --> 00:17:45,770
finding things organically and letting,

291
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:51,100
letting it get destination reveal itself
to us on his own terms instead of sort

292
00:17:51,601 --> 00:17:55,400
of finding that place as a
consumer before we get there. Um,

293
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:59,840
and a lot of technologies have eliminated
things like loneliness and boredom, um,

294
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:04,980
which sounds good and is good to a certain
extent, but loneliness and boredom, um,

295
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:07,890
can lead you to those moments that,

296
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,260
that sort of force you into
a new version of yourself.

297
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:13,710
They force you to be more extroverted
day. Totally, totally agreed.

298
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,160
They force you to read the local
newspaper instead of, you know,

299
00:18:17,161 --> 00:18:21,240
looking through your Facebook
feed. Right. Uh, uh, and so that's,

300
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:24,450
that is what we're up against
with this technological,

301
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:27,300
these technological advances.
And I don't want to be in the grumpy,

302
00:18:27,301 --> 00:18:31,020
older traveler because I remember
being being 20 and listening to these,

303
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,920
you know, baby boom era hippie sort of
lecture me on how travel used to be,

304
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:35,790
you know,

305
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:39,150
back at a time when telephone answering
machines and credit cards were seen as

306
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:42,430
this decadent form of technology. Um, and,

307
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:46,590
and so I know that there are younger
travelers who don't know anything but the

308
00:18:46,591 --> 00:18:48,660
constant conductivity of travel.
Um,

309
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:53,160
but unplugging is important and we can
talk more about that if, if you want.

310
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:58,050
Um, and we can also talk about the pluses
and there I have many recent examples

311
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,530
about how technology has have helped
this recent home home exchange.

312
00:19:01,531 --> 00:19:04,790
It's just a longtime friend who lives
in Brooklyn. She's a writer, uh,

313
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:05,940
and she wants a quiet place.

314
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:10,940
I have 30 acres in Kansas and so I get
an awesome pat in Brooklyn for a week and

315
00:19:11,011 --> 00:19:14,160
she gets a quiet farm in
Kansas for a time. Uh,

316
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:17,820
I think in places and more expensive
places like Europe, you know,

317
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:21,600
the hostel was your go to.
It was where if you wanted to save money,

318
00:19:21,601 --> 00:19:24,330
you would go to the, to
the youth hostel. Um,

319
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:29,350
and it was a great place to meet people.
You get a cheap bed, you went, you,

320
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,280
you would forego a few amenities, but
you would hang out in the hostel. Well,

321
00:19:32,281 --> 00:19:35,430
I went to Amsterdam, uh,
this summer, uh, I teach,

322
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,560
I teach a writing course
in Paris every summer.

323
00:19:37,561 --> 00:19:40,830
And my sister and my nephew came and
visited me and we wanted to go see

324
00:19:40,831 --> 00:19:44,220
Amsterdam.
And using Airbnb,

325
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,250
I was able to get a full cottage,

326
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:52,730
a 15 minute train ride outside of central
Amsterdam for about half the price as

327
00:19:53,431 --> 00:19:56,880
a hostel for three people
in the center of Amsterdam.

328
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,300
So instead of staying at, at
at somewhat grungy, hostile,

329
00:20:00,301 --> 00:20:02,280
and the red light district,
um,

330
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:05,990
we were staying in this little
town filled with windmills, uh,

331
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,180
and we had our own house to ourselves and
we could just walk down the street and

332
00:20:09,181 --> 00:20:13,350
get groceries. And so Arab,
that was an airbnb hookup.

333
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:17,310
Couchsurfing is a similar,
has similar benefits. Uh, it,

334
00:20:17,311 --> 00:20:21,840
it just allows you to break out of not
only that old hotel set of assumptions,

335
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,480
but also out of the
hostel set of assumptions.

336
00:20:24,481 --> 00:20:27,660
The idea that the cheapest option in
any place is going to be a hostile,

337
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:31,730
especially traveling in groups for the
three of us. If I had been alone, maybe I,

338
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,460
maybe the cottage wouldn't have been as
cheap as the hospital with three of us

339
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:38,520
where you're getting hostile
one bed at a time. Um,

340
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:42,810
we just got the perfect place
to stay through airbnb. Uh,

341
00:20:42,811 --> 00:20:46,650
and so those services
and even social media,

342
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,920
even going on Facebook or Twitter and,

343
00:20:48,921 --> 00:20:52,690
and I'm not a big believer
of tweeting while you travel.

344
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:56,980
I think that that really puts you into
this home mindset and it pulls you out of

345
00:20:56,981 --> 00:20:57,970
the place where you are.

346
00:20:57,971 --> 00:21:00,910
And the point of travel is experiencing
what's before your eyes and not what's

347
00:21:00,911 --> 00:21:04,060
coming across your social media feed.
But before your travel,

348
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:06,930
before one's travels,
I'm a big fan of throwing,

349
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:10,410
throwing out a tweet or Facebook
post that says, Hey, look, I'm,

350
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:13,310
I'm going to be in this place.
What are some suggestions? Uh,

351
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:18,130
and that is something that
didn't exist 10 years ago, uh,

352
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:23,220
and is not tied to a business or social
networking thing like Airbnb and couch

353
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,473
surfing,

354
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:29,020
but it could just be that your buddy
from high school has a friend who was in

355
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:32,950
the military in Germany and they have
an ex girlfriend who lives in Stockholm

356
00:21:32,951 --> 00:21:37,300
and suddenly you have a place to stay,
uh, through very random circumstances.

357
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,160
And so that kind of,
it's,

358
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:43,420
it's the old model of sitting
in the hostel or sitting
in a guest house or a bar

359
00:21:43,421 --> 00:21:46,990
and an exotic part of the world talking
to the sixth travelers who are there

360
00:21:46,991 --> 00:21:50,140
with you and them giving you advice
on points further down the road.

361
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:54,100
That principle has been taken to
social media and through networking.

362
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:57,370
That's another way that
technology has allowed that,

363
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,490
that that old hostel room
is actually killed the,

364
00:22:00,491 --> 00:22:03,400
at the literal hostel room where people
are now staring at their phones in the

365
00:22:03,401 --> 00:22:04,234
hostel room.

366
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:08,590
But is it as expanded the virtual hostel
room where instead of talking to the

367
00:22:08,591 --> 00:22:10,960
six travel or is your width physically,

368
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:15,040
you can be talking to 600 travelers
through your networks who might have some

369
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:16,090
good advice for you.

370
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,373
Okay.

371
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:22,850
This next segment was
recorded in rural Japan.

372
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,140
Late one evening with my friend
Kevin Rose at Kevin Rose on Twitter,

373
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:31,810
affectionately known as Kev Kev by those
in the know serial entrepreneur rolled

374
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:34,790
class investor in all
around wild and crazy guy.

375
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:39,620
We've been through a lot together and
here we discussed Japan how to do it

376
00:22:39,621 --> 00:22:44,621
cheaply in many other things and the
tips in this next segment apply to just

377
00:22:45,081 --> 00:22:48,440
about anywhere,
not just the land of the rising sun

378
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:56,590
and we are at [inaudible] is the name of
the place and if you hear any waterfall

379
00:22:56,601 --> 00:22:57,800
like sounds in the background,

380
00:22:57,801 --> 00:23:01,910
that is because we have a natural onset
bringing water into the rooms where

381
00:23:01,911 --> 00:23:05,750
there are wooden tubs that are
effectively indoor, outdoor.

382
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:07,070
There's an open wall,

383
00:23:07,071 --> 00:23:12,071
so you look out into a forest slash
hillside and the steam pours out into the

384
00:23:13,581 --> 00:23:17,930
great outdoors. It is winter. So
there's tons of fog and mist and so on.

385
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:20,900
It's just a magical place. Yeah,
it's, it's absolutely beautiful.

386
00:23:20,901 --> 00:23:25,901
And one of the reasons why I
chose this place to stay is one,

387
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:30,260
I had never stayed in a Ryokan like
traditional Japanese house before and I

388
00:23:30,261 --> 00:23:33,470
always wanted to do
that. Um, and number two,

389
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,900
when you're talking about it ons
and like a natural spring, um,

390
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:41,330
it's very difficult because in Japan
if you have any tattoos whatsoever,

391
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:44,240
you are forbidden from
doing the [inaudible].

392
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:48,590
Like you can't go and baths public baths
because they say that you're a yakuza.

393
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:53,210
Yeah. It's associated with
organized crime. So if you
have tattoos as Kevin does,

394
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:56,510
yes, my little pony on
both delta, it's beautiful.

395
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,960
I can see a long haired but the tassels
and it'd be quite a breathtaking thing.

396
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:05,020
It is breathtaking.
And uh,

397
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:10,030
you are not allowed to go to public
baths or most of them also true in say

398
00:24:12,231 --> 00:24:13,670
hotels where they have beach front,

399
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:17,720
you're not allowed to go on the beach if
you have exposed ends who's also hotels

400
00:24:17,721 --> 00:24:22,250
when you're going to just use their kind
of spa. Cause I went in there one time,

401
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:26,820
um, I was staying at a, I think
it was a peninsula and um,

402
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:30,950
went in to use the spa and she
goes tattoos. And I said yes.

403
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:35,060
And she handed me flesh colored tape.

404
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:40,640
I got like a little square of tape and,
and I have a few,

405
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:44,210
I was like, I'm going to need the
whole role. And it ended up not being,

406
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:49,220
I didn't actually happen, I didn't go
in so I would have been kicked out.

407
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,170
But this is nice.
It's in our room.

408
00:24:51,171 --> 00:24:53,690
So every single room here has
its own little private bath,

409
00:24:53,691 --> 00:24:57,260
hot water being piped in and it's,
it's been very relaxing.

410
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,810
And that should say also, we're not
going to talk about Japan the whole time.

411
00:24:59,811 --> 00:25:03,890
But I do think Japan is worth
highlighting for a few reasons.

412
00:25:03,891 --> 00:25:07,040
I mean I was an exchange
student here at age 15,

413
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:11,330
which was really my first time abroad.
And that year completely changed my life.

414
00:25:11,331 --> 00:25:13,460
I lived with host families,
I went to a Japanese school,

415
00:25:13,461 --> 00:25:18,320
I was the only American in my class photo,

416
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:21,380
which is very easy.
Where's Waldo all in school uniforms.

417
00:25:21,381 --> 00:25:24,740
So like crew cut,
Whitehead,

418
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,080
and then all Japanese gets about 5,000.

419
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:33,010
And it has proven to be such a subtle
and nuanced culture simultaneously.

420
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:41,840
You can come here, someone who doesn't
speak Japanese get completely lost,

421
00:25:41,841 --> 00:25:46,430
be completely bewildered. The English
level is generally pretty low here.

422
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:51,170
So it can be a totally alien environment
where you can't read any signs and it's

423
00:25:51,171 --> 00:25:52,090
not dangerous.

424
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:57,550
And the people will go above and beyond
to try and kind of decipher what you're

425
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,880
saying with your hands.
Well, not only that,

426
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:06,060
so why don't you tell the story of
Tony and the earphones? Well, it,

427
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:10,370
what are your phones? Your phone city
dropped on the salt. Oh yeah, yeah.

428
00:26:10,371 --> 00:26:14,860
So two days ago, well, there was two
stories. Okay. So this is classic, uh,

429
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:16,550
Tokyo for you.
Um,

430
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:21,230
and it's part of the reason why I love
Japan so much is like the people here are

431
00:26:21,231 --> 00:26:26,231
just so friendly and I'm really
concerned with your wellbeing.

432
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,880
So Tony,
one of the,

433
00:26:27,881 --> 00:26:32,810
the members that was traveling with us
that is traveling with us, he dropped his,

434
00:26:32,811 --> 00:26:34,820
uh, his headphones and just, you know,

435
00:26:34,821 --> 00:26:39,230
we're talking standard kind
of apple headphones, you
know, white cord, whatever.

436
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:42,650
And we walked into a coffee shop.
And now just for context,

437
00:26:42,651 --> 00:26:47,520
this is on one of the busiest streets
in a shopping district in Tokyo. Yeah.

438
00:26:47,521 --> 00:26:50,190
So there's people just, you know,
I knew in New York City, yeah,

439
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:52,260
just like all over the
place. Just, you know,

440
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:54,000
probably stepping on the
headphones and whatnot.

441
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:58,950
Somebody on the second floor of a building
across the street was looking out the

442
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:03,900
window, saw that these, these, these small
white headphones fell out of his pocket,

443
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:07,170
ran down the stairs,
grab the headphones,

444
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:12,420
it figured out which coffee bar we had
gone into and then proceeded to enter in

445
00:27:12,661 --> 00:27:16,860
and hand back the headphones,
which was just nuts.

446
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:18,810
And then on top of that,

447
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:22,860
the exact same coffee bar
I had gotten out of a taxi,

448
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:27,420
left my cell phone in the taxi.
And you know,

449
00:27:27,421 --> 00:27:29,910
of course when you're in the
states you'd like, Shit. Like my,

450
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:33,840
my cell phone's gone. I'm never
gonna see it again. And um,

451
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,780
so I use find my phone, you know, the,

452
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:38,850
the apple built in features so you
can see where the your phone is.

453
00:27:38,851 --> 00:27:42,270
I used it off of my wife's
cell phone and you know,

454
00:27:42,271 --> 00:27:46,140
it's 2025 minutes away from where we're
at in a taxi. And I'm like, God damn it.

455
00:27:46,141 --> 00:27:50,460
Like, how am I ever going to get this
back? And I pressed the button too,

456
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:54,180
which sends a signal to the cell phone.
So it sends out an audible alert to the,

457
00:27:54,181 --> 00:27:57,630
you know, so anyone who ever
is is nearby can hear that.

458
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:00,510
All of a sudden I'm watching on GPS,

459
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:04,290
the phone starts getting
closer and closer and closer.

460
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,480
This driver drives all the way back.

461
00:28:06,481 --> 00:28:11,481
20 plus minutes comes up the stairs to
the coffee shop where you drop were I

462
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:16,200
left him and then hands me my phone
back. I try to tip him, you know,

463
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:19,770
I'm thinking like in the states, you
know, you give somebody 20, 40, 50 bucks,

464
00:28:19,771 --> 00:28:24,540
I thank you so much. He wouldn't
accept my tip and was just so polite.

465
00:28:24,541 --> 00:28:29,280
Bowed to me and left. It's
just like, oh man. It just,

466
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:32,190
it makes you, when you live with, when
you live in the states, you're just like,

467
00:28:32,191 --> 00:28:36,510
what,
what happened with a few friends with us?

468
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:40,740
And it also makes you feel
like a, uh, in many, many,

469
00:28:40,741 --> 00:28:45,480
many instances and uncivilized Harry
Savage. That's what I'm saying.

470
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:48,150
Like you wake up,
you know,

471
00:28:48,151 --> 00:28:52,920
you're going to be ashamed of at least
17 things that you do that day. Uh,

472
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:54,570
but it's,
it's a wonderful environment.

473
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:57,690
And one thing that I want to
underscore before we move on,

474
00:28:57,691 --> 00:28:58,770
and I'm sure we'll come back to it,

475
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:04,250
is that you don't have to have a lot of
money or spend a lot of money to enjoy

476
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,710
Tokyo.
This is a common misconception.

477
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:12,300
It can be extremely expensive, but it
doesn't have to be extremely expensive.

478
00:29:12,301 --> 00:29:15,510
And certainly Japan as a whole doesn't
need to be extremely expensive.

479
00:29:15,511 --> 00:29:20,400
When I was here at 15, I had no money
whatsoever. And you can, for instance,

480
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:26,180
find stores that you would recognize like
seven 11 that are completely different

481
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:29,970
from the equivalent at home. And you
can go into a seven 11. For instance,

482
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:34,400
and you can grab one of my favorite
on the go bites, which is Onigiri.

483
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,710
These are rice balls wrapped and dry
seaweed and filled with various meats,

484
00:29:37,711 --> 00:29:40,020
vegetables or fish,
say tuna whenever it might be,

485
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:44,980
and those cost about 110 yen.
So let's just call that a dollar.

486
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:49,110
And you can find those at
seven 11 store called Sun Cus,

487
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,770
s u n k u s or Lawson.

488
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:54,670
It's packaged in such a way
that you pull apart the plastic,

489
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,410
which keeps the seaweed separate.

490
00:29:56,411 --> 00:30:01,411
It automatically wraps this rice triangle
and you have effectively an entire

491
00:30:01,601 --> 00:30:06,040
meal right there for somewhere between one
and $2. Yeah, well you know it's funny,

492
00:30:06,041 --> 00:30:08,980
I don't know if I told you this,
but I was here with David Chang.

493
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:10,960
I'm sure a lot of people
are familiar with him,

494
00:30:10,961 --> 00:30:14,230
but he's one of the probably the
top five chefs in the United States.

495
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:18,790
Very famous Momofuku Mofo. Yeah,
just like Bar, right? Yeah.

496
00:30:18,791 --> 00:30:20,380
Milk bar and a,

497
00:30:20,381 --> 00:30:24,160
we happen to be here on the same trip
with some friends and he was ranting and

498
00:30:24,161 --> 00:30:28,030
raving about these seven
11 a egg salad sandwich.

499
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:32,670
And it's like, you know, a multi,
like, you know, it was, yeah,

500
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:34,820
I think it has three Michelin Stars
at one of his restaurant. I mean,

501
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:39,830
I'm top of the world chef freaking out
about a seven 11 different seven 11 the

502
00:30:40,001 --> 00:30:43,330
United States. Yeah. I mean,
not high end food by any means.

503
00:30:43,331 --> 00:30:45,490
I mean a couple of bucks
for this egg salad sandwich,

504
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:49,030
but prepared with like my
beer says prepared with pride.

505
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,640
Yeah. There's so much. A couple of
other go tos that suggest in Tokyo,

506
00:30:54,641 --> 00:30:58,750
if you can get a ticket, go
to the Jubilee Museum. G, H I,

507
00:30:58,751 --> 00:31:01,420
B l I museum, which is the museum. It's,

508
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:05,440
think of it as the Disney Museum
for the Walt Disney of Japan.

509
00:31:05,441 --> 00:31:09,910
And that's a Miyazaki Heiau. He did
spirited away. My favorite movie,

510
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:15,240
my neighbor Totoro a whole long list of
blockbuster and kind of a genre defining

511
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:19,420
anime film send it is, it is
one of the most incredible, uh,

512
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:23,890
museums I've ever been to. It's in the
middle of what they call me. Taka forest,

513
00:31:23,891 --> 00:31:28,510
which is right next to her is, you know,
cause she had a Koan and then, uh, a lot,

514
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:32,640
a lot of things in Japan are also free.
You can go to [inaudible],

515
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:35,230
h a r a j u k you,

516
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:39,520
where you can find on the weekends
Elvis impersonators doing their dancing.

517
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:41,620
This has been going on for decades now.

518
00:31:41,621 --> 00:31:43,540
And you can also go to
[inaudible] dot doughty,

519
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:48,990
which is I guess tuck a stuff street
or alleyway where you find dozens or

520
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:53,590
hundreds of teenagers in
high schoolers doing cosplay.

521
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:57,220
So they wear these crazy outfits and walk
up and down the streets or showing off

522
00:31:57,221 --> 00:32:00,880
the weirdest outfits imaginable or into
that. A lot of people are into it. Like,

523
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:03,700
do you, are you kind of like
when you see a cosplay or you,

524
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:06,820
cause it's like a sexual thing?
Well, for, so I, you know,

525
00:32:06,821 --> 00:32:10,840
I think that for some people
that might be part of it,

526
00:32:10,841 --> 00:32:14,350
but I think that it's just a form of,

527
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:19,650
of hyper expression in a culture where
a lot of people feel very repressed or

528
00:32:20,561 --> 00:32:22,450
overly polite. Most of the time. Yeah.

529
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:26,620
And so then they blow it
out on the weekends and they
like put in pink contacts

530
00:32:26,621 --> 00:32:31,420
and white hair and 12 inch platform shoes
and wear the wackiest shit imaginable.

531
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:35,020
Yeah. Maybe Walter, uh, in the, in
the states cause plays like a bigger,

532
00:32:35,021 --> 00:32:38,310
cause they'd dress up like
video game characters and
things like that when, sure.

533
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:41,570
You know, hey comicon
and whatnot. Oh yeah.

534
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,190
Well there are a lot of things that are,

535
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:45,810
that's not really Japanese cosplay though.

536
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:49,340
There are a lot of things that are regular
and other countries that end up being

537
00:32:49,341 --> 00:32:54,341
adopted by weird niche groups in the u
s and take on in some cases like creepy

538
00:32:54,951 --> 00:32:57,830
or weird or elements, right?
Like tango in Argentina,

539
00:32:57,831 --> 00:33:01,250
normal tango in some places in
the United States. Super Weird.

540
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:06,170
And I'm just saying that as someone who
loves tango and dances dances in many

541
00:33:06,171 --> 00:33:08,780
places, but primarily in
Argentina, way back in the day.

542
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:11,810
Same thing with Japanese stuff.
It's like, oh Monga cool.

543
00:33:11,811 --> 00:33:15,520
And then you find like a little subculture
in a given city in the u s and you're

544
00:33:15,521 --> 00:33:16,161
like,
wait a second,

545
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:21,161
it's all 40 year old guys who are like
reading creepy half Porno Hentai Manga.

546
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:24,260
Okay. I don't think I'm going to
hang out here. Right, right. Anymore.

547
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:29,900
So a segue. Yes. How do we
stay away from that? Uh,

548
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,730
let's Segue,
fall from hint,

549
00:33:31,731 --> 00:33:34,240
the hint that you're going to look
up those people interested there.

550
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:38,570
There are two books that have helped me
review and prep for this trip in terms

551
00:33:38,571 --> 00:33:41,600
of Japanese that I'd like to suggest
people check out if you're interested in

552
00:33:41,601 --> 00:33:45,530
Japanese, uh, very short. And I was able
to get through these really quickly.

553
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:49,340
The first is probably for people who
speak more intermediate Japanese,

554
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:50,900
so you'd want some basics first,

555
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,680
but it is 13 secrets for speaking
fluent Japanese. And this is by,

556
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:57,920
I think it's Giles' or
Giles, g. I, l. E. S,

557
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:01,940
let's say Giles Marie and u R. R a. Y.

558
00:34:01,941 --> 00:34:05,270
So 13 secrets for speaking fluent
Japanese. Very, very helpful.

559
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:09,470
And then the second is maybe
a bit dry for some people,

560
00:34:09,471 --> 00:34:14,471
but I like very concise grammar summaries
that are quick reference and this is

561
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:21,040
Japanese verbs and essentials of grammar
and that is by Rita lamp can l a m P K

562
00:34:22,911 --> 00:34:26,710
I n
fill Cogan

563
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:27,910
k e o g.

564
00:34:27,911 --> 00:34:32,911
H a n at Phil Cogan on Twitter has worked
in television for almost 30 years on

565
00:34:34,271 --> 00:34:37,930
more than a thousand program episodes
in more than a hundred countries.

566
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:41,560
His work has earned him numerous
awards including 10 that's right,

567
00:34:41,561 --> 00:34:43,210
10 primetime Emmys.

568
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:48,340
He has pressed best known
as the co-executive producer
and host of CBS is series

569
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:49,690
the amazing race,

570
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:55,110
but there's much more to fill
story including unbelievable
bucket lists near to

571
00:34:55,511 --> 00:34:59,350
the experiences and all sorts of
other adventures. And misadventures.

572
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:04,740
I was doing a story about a 22,000 ton
shipwreck that had sunk in in New Zealand

573
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:10,900
and it was down about 120 feet underwater
and it was on its starboard side.

574
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:14,620
22,000 tons is like,
it's as big as you know,

575
00:35:14,621 --> 00:35:19,621
a cruise liner that you see going
around at the ports around the world.

576
00:35:20,021 --> 00:35:24,190
And big, really big and 120 feet, uh,

577
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:27,880
is for people who've never
done any scuba diving in.

578
00:35:27,881 --> 00:35:31,150
Unless you have special equipment.
I mean that's not a lot of bottom time.

579
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:35,860
Exactly. So most recreational divers
get certified to dive to about 60 feet.

580
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:38,130
The best stuff that you see underwater is

581
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:42,520
generally in the first 30 feet because
once you get past 30 feet, the color,

582
00:35:42,521 --> 00:35:46,940
it changes you, you lose all the reds
and everything becomes very blue. Um,

583
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:49,860
so I always say to people,
look, you don't need to go deep.

584
00:35:49,861 --> 00:35:52,240
And unless you're going
onto a wreck or something,

585
00:35:52,241 --> 00:35:56,340
there's some real reason to go deep. The
only reason to go deeper, as you know,

586
00:35:56,460 --> 00:36:00,180
if it is a wreck,
you can get great diving in 10,

587
00:36:00,181 --> 00:36:03,210
15 feet of water with the
Carl close to the surface.

588
00:36:03,211 --> 00:36:07,530
The colors are brighter and so on.
But this wreck was deepened. And, and,

589
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,420
and as you said,
the deeper you are,

590
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:14,070
the faster you chew through air and you
eat up air and that affects how long you

591
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:18,780
can stay down. And the longer you're
down deep, the more nitrogen you get.

592
00:36:18,781 --> 00:36:20,550
In your blood. And so it's, it,

593
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:24,540
there's a real science to diving and
you have to be super careful as you're a

594
00:36:24,541 --> 00:36:28,890
diver. I am. Yeah. So you, you understand
seeing people get nitrogen narcosis yeah.

595
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:32,220
Ad At exactly 120 feet.
I saw a guy start to tr,

596
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:36,630
he tried to take off all of his gear
and just drop it in a small group and he

597
00:36:36,631 --> 00:36:40,760
was stopped. But that was the guy
that worked at Chippendales. I no, no,

598
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:45,150
no. A different guy. Okay.
No, but I, but people, yeah,

599
00:36:45,151 --> 00:36:47,940
I've seen the same thing to take the
regulator out and they start having

600
00:36:47,941 --> 00:36:52,650
conversations with fish and it's not a
good idea. No. It getting narked. Um,

601
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:57,680
yeah. So that's all the more reason
to get properly certified. So, um,

602
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:01,380
I was with some very experienced divers
and way more experienced than me.

603
00:37:01,381 --> 00:37:03,900
And they were,
they were doing the salvage him.

604
00:37:03,901 --> 00:37:05,970
We were going to be the first
people to shoot on the ship,

605
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:08,370
get to go inside the ship and explore it.

606
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:12,810
And the cameraman that I was with,
the also very experienced,

607
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:15,240
but because there was a bit,
because the,

608
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:19,050
there's so much silt inside the boat
and there was a current as well rolling

609
00:37:19,051 --> 00:37:22,650
through the book. We were, we, and we,
in those days we were shooting on film.

610
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,120
It's not like today where you
could go down with a great group,

611
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:28,620
a Gopro and some lights and you know,
you could film for a couple of hours.

612
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:33,621
We had a two and a half minute roll of
film in a 100 foot daylight spool role

613
00:37:36,061 --> 00:37:37,960
that was in a little
housing inside the kit.

614
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:42,630
So literally that's the only amount
of footage we had to shoot on film.

615
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:45,270
That's how long I go back.

616
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:48,810
So that the plan was that we
would go into the ballroom of the,

617
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:50,850
of the ship and big,

618
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:55,230
big ballroom and then the crew would come
in from another door and we would meet

619
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:58,350
in the middle so that we didn't stir
up all the silt going into the same

620
00:37:58,351 --> 00:38:02,070
entrances and we'd swim towards each
other. They'd get us coming towards them.

621
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:07,490
And so we go down and what I know
now is if you go into a wreck,

622
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:12,780
you tie line on the outside of the rec
so that you have something to follow out

623
00:38:12,781 --> 00:38:13,770
if something goes wrong.

624
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:19,470
These guys were so familiar with the wreck
and so experienced and knew the place

625
00:38:19,471 --> 00:38:24,471
so well they didn't tie align on and I
just sort of followed them in not knowing

626
00:38:24,961 --> 00:38:29,250
that that was sort of what you should do.
And you know,

627
00:38:29,251 --> 00:38:31,680
the other rule with diving is
you never leave your dive buddy.

628
00:38:31,681 --> 00:38:36,681
So I'm following this guy and I was too
scared to tell him because I was trying

629
00:38:37,091 --> 00:38:40,840
to be a man that before
I'm really claustrophobic.

630
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:46,860
So I go in this little doorway and it
would've been like imagine a small window

631
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,700
like two by three.

632
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:52,840
We go through this little port hole and
then we start weaving our way through

633
00:38:52,841 --> 00:38:56,390
the ship. And I, as we go on deeper and
deeper and deeper into the shipwreck,

634
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:59,050
I'm completely disoriented
and I have no idea where I am.

635
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,690
My hand sweats just listening
to the description. Oh yeah.

636
00:39:01,691 --> 00:39:04,030
And I started to breathe like breathe.

637
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:08,840
But every time I sort of like was at the
point of tapping him to go, you know,

638
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,750
I gotta get Outta here.
I feel panicky.

639
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:14,470
He just kept disappearing deeper and
deeper and deeper in another corner,

640
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,350
another corner. And I thought, and
he was moving quickly cause he's,

641
00:39:17,351 --> 00:39:20,320
he's used to being in this wreck.
They're doing the salvage on this thing.

642
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:26,250
So finally we come into an opening and
then he shines a light around and there's

643
00:39:26,861 --> 00:39:31,810
this huge ballroom. Now the ship is on
its starboard side on its right side.

644
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:35,200
So all the tables on a ship,
shipper, old, bolted to the floor.

645
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,200
So imagine the tables
on a right angle to us.

646
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:41,470
And then he gestures to
me to hold onto the table.

647
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:44,560
And then he told me on
the surface that he,

648
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:46,960
we were going to switch out the lights,
uh,

649
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:50,820
to save battery power cause it's called.
And now we don't have a lot of, uh,

650
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:54,340
and we've got seven Mil wetsuits on is
pretty cold and you can feel kind of the

651
00:39:54,341 --> 00:39:57,970
current pushing through the ship. And
that's why we were holding onto the table.

652
00:39:57,971 --> 00:40:01,930
So we didn't drift. And you know, through
the room and now we're looking ahead,

653
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:06,270
any sort of points at me and looks ahead
and says that's where the crew is going

654
00:40:06,271 --> 00:40:08,590
to come out. And I knew that that's
where they're going to come out.

655
00:40:08,591 --> 00:40:09,424
So I was like,
okay,

656
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:13,300
so we're waiting with the lights off in
the dark and I'm processing all of this

657
00:40:13,301 --> 00:40:17,260
and starting to try to slow my breathing
down and like stay calm. It's okay.

658
00:40:17,261 --> 00:40:21,310
You know, you're with an expert,
everything's good. And uh,

659
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:26,140
after what seemed like, like minutes
all I want it to turn my light on,

660
00:40:26,141 --> 00:40:28,510
but I also didn't want to do it cause
I thought he'll think I'm a wimp.

661
00:40:28,511 --> 00:40:29,380
Like why am I turning off?

662
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:33,190
I just want to turn my light on to see
where I was like to have sent some sense

663
00:40:33,191 --> 00:40:36,520
of where I was.
He flicks his light on.

664
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,130
Like in Halloween,
when you take your life,

665
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:42,090
put it on the Chin and you make
yourself look scary. Right.

666
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:44,200
That's all I remembered.
The light went on.

667
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:47,620
It's pointing from his chin looking up.
He looks scary.

668
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:51,250
Then he gestures me with his hand,
puts it out in front of me, like wait.

669
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:55,890
Then he points at my hands on the table
like and gestures for me to hold onto

670
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,700
the table and then boom,

671
00:40:57,730 --> 00:41:01,600
he just disappears around a corner
and I don't have my light on.

672
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,120
He's got his light on it and the
light disappears and he's gone.

673
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:09,340
Well in that moment I'm
like, why is he leaving?

674
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:10,690
Why did he just leave?

675
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:14,740
So in my haste to find my light too,

676
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:17,860
I've start flailing around,

677
00:41:17,861 --> 00:41:22,540
let go of the table and I feel myself
drifting away from where the table is and

678
00:41:22,541 --> 00:41:22,991
moving,

679
00:41:22,991 --> 00:41:27,370
drifting into the ballroom and I just
went into a mad panic and I couldn't find

680
00:41:27,371 --> 00:41:31,360
my light. By the time I found my light,
I had silted up all the water around me.

681
00:41:31,361 --> 00:41:32,440
I couldn't see anything.

682
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:36,380
And now I don't know where the table
was that I was meant to hold on to.

683
00:41:36,381 --> 00:41:38,720
And I'm looking ahead. I can't
see any lights, I can't see him.

684
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:42,140
And I started to breathe really,
really fast. And now you're a diver,

685
00:41:42,141 --> 00:41:42,951
you understand this.

686
00:41:42,951 --> 00:41:47,810
But when you dive in for anybody who's
never had a regulator in their mouth,

687
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:49,640
if you breathe too quickly,

688
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:53,740
there's a little diaphragm that allows
for exhalation and inhalation in the,

689
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:58,490
in the regulator that you put in your
mouth to suck in air. If you go too fast,

690
00:41:58,491 --> 00:42:02,210
the diaphragm can't keep up with the speed
of inhalation and exhalation and then

691
00:42:02,211 --> 00:42:03,260
you start to suck water.

692
00:42:03,261 --> 00:42:07,190
And then so I started like taking little
bits of water in and I'm beating the,

693
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:10,790
the, the, the valve and
just panicking like mad,

694
00:42:10,791 --> 00:42:14,900
mad panic and I thought I have to get
out of here and all your weight or you

695
00:42:14,901 --> 00:42:17,600
want to do is just get out. Right.
But I don't know how to get out.

696
00:42:17,601 --> 00:42:19,520
I don't know where up and down is.
I don't,

697
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:23,750
the bubbles don't go up when the ships
on his side like that and your deep down

698
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:27,290
they hit the walls and then they
run up the walls. They follow.

699
00:42:27,291 --> 00:42:31,820
We had pass and I thought,
I have no idea where I am right now.

700
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:35,390
I can't even see where the table
is. And panicking, panicking.

701
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:39,310
And I knew that someone had died in their,
uh,

702
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:43,520
someone had gone in there
and got disconnected from
a group and he had died and

703
00:42:43,521 --> 00:42:45,230
drifted off into the ship and died.

704
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:48,650
I also knew that one of the engineers
never made it out when the ship sank in

705
00:42:48,651 --> 00:42:51,740
the first place. So, and just to set
the stage also for people listening,

706
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:56,420
I remember when I did a dive
at the blue hole in Belize,

707
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,030
which is about 120 feet.
This is when this guy got narked.

708
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:03,200
It takes so long to get down
because you're equalizing. Yup.

709
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:04,640
By the time you get down,

710
00:43:04,641 --> 00:43:08,300
I at least we were told at the time with
the gear we had, you have eight minutes.

711
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:13,160
Yeah. So all of this is happening.
Yeah, very quickly. Very quickly,

712
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:17,450
very quickly. And we, we weren't on
nitrox. Nitrox as you know, is a, is a,

713
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:22,460
is a mixed gas that you can get where it
has more oxygen and less nitrogen so it

714
00:43:22,461 --> 00:43:26,930
increases your bottom time.
So this is pre nitrox days and so yes,

715
00:43:26,931 --> 00:43:28,940
you're absolutely right.
We had a very limited window,

716
00:43:28,941 --> 00:43:32,060
which is why he must have gone off to
find the crew because he realized we were

717
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:35,600
eating up a lot of time. And where
were they? Where were the crew?

718
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:41,030
Well I don't remember exactly
how I got from there to the boat,

719
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:44,330
but this guy obviously
came back to get me.

720
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:50,050
And really it's all a
blur between panicking,

721
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:56,120
mad panic eyes like wide like
sources to being on the boat,

722
00:43:56,540 --> 00:44:01,540
to looking up into the sky and seeing
the most amazing blue I'd ever seen in my

723
00:44:01,611 --> 00:44:05,900
life. Like just look like
totally surreal. And then,

724
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:10,550
and I'm lying on the ground like breathing
and I look up and all these faces

725
00:44:10,551 --> 00:44:13,280
looking down and it, Phil,
you're good, you're good. I'm
like, yeah, yeah, I'm good.

726
00:44:13,281 --> 00:44:18,140
I'm good. Like trying to play like
nothing happened but my heart is pounding,

727
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:23,740
pounding and I was so like the feeling,

728
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:25,760
the feeling of euphoria,
the,

729
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:30,650
the relief of being alive to
know that I was alive was,

730
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:33,690
was like nothing I'd ever experienced.

731
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:36,570
And it really was oldest stuff.

732
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:41,910
It was as if my Iq went up 25 points
in that moment. You know what I mean?

733
00:44:41,911 --> 00:44:46,620
Because I was like, how dumb we you that
thought you were going to live forever?

734
00:44:46,621 --> 00:44:49,080
How dumb were you that you did?

735
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:51,900
You've been doing all these dumb
things in your life and you have real,

736
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:54,390
really have no purpose in life.

737
00:44:55,350 --> 00:44:59,700
And I started to think about this is
all happening while I'm having these

738
00:44:59,701 --> 00:45:04,550
conversations with them. But
I'm like, I'm thinking, man, I,

739
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:08,520
I love girls and I haven't even like
really explored that whole world. And

740
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:13,410
that's like the second or
third thing that comes up.

741
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:17,820
It was actually right out there. And
of course in my sexual prime, I mean,

742
00:45:17,821 --> 00:45:21,750
come on right up there. I don't
want to say it was the first thing,

743
00:45:21,751 --> 00:45:23,440
cause I don't want you to
get the wrong idea about me,

744
00:45:23,441 --> 00:45:26,460
but it was up there and I
was like, damn, you know,

745
00:45:26,461 --> 00:45:28,920
you've got a lot to do with your life.
So no,

746
00:45:28,921 --> 00:45:31,290
but there were all these things that
came to me and a lot of them were very

747
00:45:31,291 --> 00:45:34,420
selfish. I was 19 years old. So, uh,

748
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:38,370
I got myself together and I,

749
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:43,880
I wanted to find a piece of paper
and a pen and I just wrote down just

750
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:49,100
everything that I felt like I had all the
time in the world to do and that I had

751
00:45:49,471 --> 00:45:52,590
to get down on a piece of
paper to get out to go, okay,

752
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:56,190
this is not a dress rehearsal.
You can die, you will die.

753
00:45:56,610 --> 00:45:58,680
You don't know how long
you've got before you die.

754
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:02,310
You better figure out what you're doing
with your life and you better get on

755
00:46:02,311 --> 00:46:03,150
with it straight away.

756
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:08,700
And one of the first things on my list
was go back in the shipwreck seriously

757
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
because I thought I cannot
walk away from this fear.

758
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,870
I was so petrified of what
had had happened and I,

759
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:20,790
and I decided I would explain
to the diver, you know,
that I found it challenging.

760
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:23,340
He knew that shuttling Djing,

761
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:25,830
but I said it was like kind
of like falling off a horse.

762
00:46:25,831 --> 00:46:28,860
I really felt like got to get back on,
got to get back on.

763
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:33,370
I have to go back because if I let this
fear get on his time with some string or

764
00:46:33,371 --> 00:46:36,870
so, well I didn't actually go back
with him cause I didn't even, I didn't,

765
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:39,870
I didn't have time to do the lesson
about this spring. Yeah. But I,

766
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:41,190
but I went back with,

767
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:46,230
by disclosing a little more by fear to
the other diver and it was more honest.

768
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:50,190
And, and then he, when he knew that
and we had to get this thing shot,

769
00:46:50,191 --> 00:46:55,020
he was obviously more aware of,
you know, he thought I was so,

770
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:56,430
cause I was so gung Ho,

771
00:46:56,460 --> 00:47:00,120
like he didn't have any indication
that there was any fear in me at all.

772
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:03,300
But then I kind of said, you know, listen
to man, I really freaked out. He goes,

773
00:47:03,301 --> 00:47:06,330
oh no kidding. And I, and I
said, but I need to go back.

774
00:47:06,331 --> 00:47:09,330
We've got to go back and do this. And we
went back and we did it and we shot it.

775
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,160
And that was the start.

776
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:14,220
That was the first thing I'd ticked
off my list question for you.

777
00:47:14,221 --> 00:47:17,350
So when you decided to go back down,
you know,

778
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:22,410
as you're descending petrified and getting
ready to go through that tiny opening.

779
00:47:22,470 --> 00:47:26,630
Yeah. What was the self talk, I
mean it's a long time ago, but what,

780
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:30,070
what is your self talk like
in a moment like that? Well,

781
00:47:30,071 --> 00:47:32,920
it's something that I've
used a lot since then,

782
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:38,250
which was instead of
internalizing everything I
looked out and what I realized

783
00:47:41,351 --> 00:47:46,210
was that this guy was super experienced
and had been down on that shipwreck many

784
00:47:46,211 --> 00:47:49,720
times and come out of there
successfully many times.

785
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:55,170
And if I followed his procedure and
if I observed him being an expert,

786
00:47:56,231 --> 00:48:01,231
doing something and looked out at that
rather than turning it back into my own

787
00:48:02,381 --> 00:48:07,360
head about what I didn't know and what
I couldn't do, that I was in good hands.

788
00:48:07,990 --> 00:48:12,070
So ever since that moment and all
the crazy things that I've done,

789
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:16,990
I've taken a tremendous amount of comfort
in being surrounded by people who I

790
00:48:16,991 --> 00:48:19,030
know are better at me at doing something,

791
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:22,390
who have tremendous expertise
at whatever they're doing.

792
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:27,490
And to really observe them in that
moment when they are in there,

793
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,890
when they are using expertise
than they are constantly.

794
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:37,260
They have taken that has taken possibly
at least 10,000 hours to get to and and

795
00:48:37,571 --> 00:48:42,220
to look at it in a way like, wow, how
cool is that? I'm with this person,

796
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:43,121
man or woman,

797
00:48:43,121 --> 00:48:48,100
whoever it is that is allowing me and
given me the privilege to be with them to

798
00:48:48,101 --> 00:48:51,550
do what they do so well and
there are specialist in there.

799
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:56,370
Good and so you would be explicitly
reminding yourself of all these things if

800
00:48:56,371 --> 00:49:01,371
you're going into a situation
that is provoking nerves and fear,

801
00:49:01,621 --> 00:49:03,360
is that the voice inside the head?

802
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:06,180
It is. It's, I made up
a quote which I really,

803
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:11,070
that I share with a lot of people which
is focus on what you do have and what

804
00:49:11,071 --> 00:49:13,570
you can do instead of what
you don't have and what you do

805
00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:19,483
up next.

806
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:24,880
Kevin Kelly at Kevin two Kelly the
number two at Kevin two Kelly on Twitter

807
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:29,510
might just be the real life,
most interesting man in the world.

808
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:30,573
He'll be my vote.

809
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:34,160
I think maybe tied with another Jen
who's going to come up in a second.

810
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:37,070
Kevin is senior maverick
at wired magazine,

811
00:49:37,071 --> 00:49:41,780
which he co founded in 1993 he also
cofounded the all Species Foundation,

812
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:46,810
a nonprofit aimed at
cataloging in identifying every
living species on earth in

813
00:49:47,211 --> 00:49:49,310
his spare time.
He writes bestselling books,

814
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:52,340
many of them like the inevitable subtitle,

815
00:49:52,341 --> 00:49:55,190
understanding the 12 technological
forces that will shape our future.

816
00:49:55,970 --> 00:49:56,571
And by the way,

817
00:49:56,571 --> 00:50:00,620
he's considered an incredibly accurate
futurist is predictions of pan out over

818
00:50:00,621 --> 00:50:02,960
and over again, even though he spends
part of the year with the Amish.

819
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:06,200
But that's another story.
He cofounded the Rosetta project,

820
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:10,190
which is building an archive
of all documented human
language and serves on the

821
00:50:10,191 --> 00:50:14,570
board of the long now foundation.
He alongside Stewart brand and others,

822
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:19,280
Stewart brand might be the person tied
with Kevin for the most interesting man

823
00:50:19,281 --> 00:50:20,630
in the world nomination.

824
00:50:20,810 --> 00:50:24,500
He alongside Stewart brand and others
is also investigating how to revive and

825
00:50:24,501 --> 00:50:28,580
restore endangered or extinct
species. The woolly mammoth. Yup.

826
00:50:28,790 --> 00:50:33,500
Jurassic Park stuff. But in real life
I'd always wanted to travel with Kevin,

827
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,170
uh, for, for 10 plus years.

828
00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:40,100
I would say I wanted even before I knew
him to travel with Kevin and I finally

829
00:50:40,101 --> 00:50:43,580
got my chance and it is
represented in this segment.

830
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:46,790
We traveled through Uzbekistan together.
Long story,

831
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:50,690
Kevin touches on a lot of cool stuff and
we had a blast recording it in the back

832
00:50:50,691 --> 00:50:52,940
of a car as it spread
through the mountains.

833
00:50:52,970 --> 00:50:54,890
So I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.

834
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:00,490
Hi,
this is Kevin Kelly.

835
00:51:00,491 --> 00:51:05,491
I'm sitting in the back of a car crossing
in a mountain pass about 2000 meters

836
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:10,920
in the attention mountains in Uzbekistan.

837
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:16,500
In a Spec of Stan is a central Asian
country that's generally south of Russia,

838
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:21,760
north of Afghanistan, and next to
all the other stands like Kazakhstan,

839
00:51:21,910 --> 00:51:22,810
Turkmenistan,

840
00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:28,950
Tajikistan sitting next to me as we
crossed the mountains is Tim Ferriss,

841
00:51:30,310 --> 00:51:35,310
the legendary explored her and
explainer of worldclass performances.

842
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:39,520
And we're going to do a
joint, uh, recording. Uh,

843
00:51:39,670 --> 00:51:44,260
Tim's going to tell us about his favorite
for cool tools and we'll find out what

844
00:51:44,290 --> 00:51:46,450
he's up to lately.
Tim,

845
00:51:46,990 --> 00:51:49,510
why don't you tell us
about your first cool tool.

846
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:53,950
Okay. The first cool tool, if
we're sitting in the back here,

847
00:51:53,951 --> 00:51:55,990
we have the bags around us,
bottles of water,

848
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:59,200
a bunch of different gadgets
and objects piled in my lab.

849
00:51:59,770 --> 00:52:04,390
The first that I can talk about is
actually in my other piece of luggage.

850
00:52:04,450 --> 00:52:09,450
I don't have any checked luggage and it
is a check it that I roll up and travel

851
00:52:10,871 --> 00:52:14,050
with constantly.
It's from a brand called now and a you,

852
00:52:14,051 --> 00:52:18,850
I believe it's based in Portland and you
can think of it as a blazer or a riding

853
00:52:18,851 --> 00:52:19,331
jacket.

854
00:52:19,331 --> 00:52:24,331
And what what makes it unique is
a number of different factors.

855
00:52:24,670 --> 00:52:28,900
A, and you can roll it up and throw it
on to say a black tee shirt and you look

856
00:52:28,901 --> 00:52:33,901
like you're ready for a business dinner
or a formal or semi formal occasion.

857
00:52:34,721 --> 00:52:38,110
So it saves me the trouble of packing
a lot of collared shirts for instance.

858
00:52:38,550 --> 00:52:42,100
And there are collared
shirts that don't wrinkle,

859
00:52:42,101 --> 00:52:45,640
but they do take up more space than
say, black tee shirt. So this now,

860
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:50,440
and it could be, uh, I have, uh,
several different models at home,

861
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:54,100
weather resistant. Of course it was
designed in the Pacific northwest,

862
00:52:54,101 --> 00:52:58,690
you would expect that which
comes in handy. So that
would be my first cool tool.

863
00:52:58,730 --> 00:53:02,680
Uh, plenty of pockets of, but there our
lapels, so you can get away with murder,

864
00:53:02,890 --> 00:53:07,780
you could wear it in a light rain or you
could wear it at a nice dinner and it,

865
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:10,810
it is an incredibly
flexible piece of clothing.

866
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:15,850
So one of the hazards for me anyway,
if I tried to roll up a jacket,

867
00:53:16,510 --> 00:53:21,060
I never quite get the wrinkles out.
So no iron shirts,

868
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:24,250
you can kind of hang in your hot
shower and it will dissipate.

869
00:53:24,610 --> 00:53:26,190
How does work in terms of

870
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:28,770
an wrinkling it or do you,

871
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:33,800
does it just magically unwrinkled so
this particular jacket has a number of

872
00:53:34,471 --> 00:53:35,580
features,

873
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:39,210
I think that disguise wrinkles and that
there's also that just the material

874
00:53:39,211 --> 00:53:43,740
science aspect, the, the fabric blends
that are used tend not to wrinkle,

875
00:53:43,770 --> 00:53:45,210
number one.
Number two,

876
00:53:45,570 --> 00:53:50,570
it has folds and pockets and the
lapels that for whatever reason,

877
00:53:52,110 --> 00:53:56,820
make any wrinkles less noticeable.
And then there's the color.

878
00:53:56,850 --> 00:54:00,630
So if you want to avoid problems
with wrinkles, generally,

879
00:54:00,690 --> 00:54:01,650
at least in my experience,

880
00:54:01,690 --> 00:54:05,850
you want darker clothing so that
under light you're not casting,

881
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:09,390
you're not having shadows cast
across or beneath the wrinkles.

882
00:54:09,391 --> 00:54:12,360
So this is a charcoal color jacket.

883
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:16,560
It's kind of like your typical suit,
check it length,

884
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:20,880
or is it more like a
outdoor jacket at the waist?

885
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:25,770
I would say typical dinner jacket
length. Uh, so it's not getting cutoff.

886
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:28,860
Doesn't show off any midriff for
those of you were looking for that.

887
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:32,090
You're out of luck. Yeah. Uh,

888
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:36,360
so you'd be able to see your belt if it
were on buttons in the front. Right. Okay.

889
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:37,321
So that's,

890
00:54:37,321 --> 00:54:42,321
and it's very lightweight and about tell
the readers about how big it compresses

891
00:54:44,131 --> 00:54:47,910
into if you were to roll it up.
Well,

892
00:54:47,970 --> 00:54:50,310
and if you want to know how
to roll up a jacket like that,

893
00:54:50,311 --> 00:54:53,670
well you could actually
go online and look at how,

894
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:58,340
say a judo uniform is folded. And, uh,

895
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:02,070
if you roll it up,
well you are looking at,

896
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:07,230
let's just say the,
the bottom three quarters,

897
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:10,050
meaning it'll cover the very bottom,

898
00:55:10,450 --> 00:55:15,450
a fabric of a standard sized school
backpacks are not thinking about a hikers

899
00:55:16,321 --> 00:55:20,280
backpack. Uh, so if, if I had to
estimate, I would say we're looking at,

900
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:25,700
I get it down to about a role that is
10 inches in length and about a three to

901
00:55:29,341 --> 00:55:32,970
four inches in diameter.
Well that's very impressive.

902
00:55:33,810 --> 00:55:38,400
I carry a lightweight down Jack if they
compress this into something very small,

903
00:55:38,401 --> 00:55:42,300
but it's certainly not as fancy or,

904
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:45,780
or you know,
suitable for dinner jacket like yours is.

905
00:55:46,350 --> 00:55:48,900
And I mean a couple of other
tips for folks and the by,

906
00:55:48,901 --> 00:55:53,550
I'm by no means say hyper minimalists
and say Appalachian trail hiker or

907
00:55:53,551 --> 00:55:56,430
anything like that.
But I also have for instance,

908
00:55:57,330 --> 00:56:02,190
a synthetic because I
don't want to lose the uh,

909
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:06,260
insulating ability if it,
if it gets wet. I have a,

910
00:56:06,261 --> 00:56:11,261
a synthetic down vest that is
also stuffed into this backpack,

911
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:16,580
which I can put on top of that sort of a
fancy looking jacket in the case that I

912
00:56:18,421 --> 00:56:22,830
need more warmth. Yeah, that's
brilliant. That's a really good hack. So

913
00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:25,530
again,
that's called the now

914
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:30,510
check it and a, you know, no.
Okay. And approximately what's it,

915
00:56:30,570 --> 00:56:34,960
what's it cost? Just give me a
range. That's really good question.

916
00:56:34,990 --> 00:56:38,790
I bought it a long time ago. It's not
a, it's not cheap, but then again,

917
00:56:38,791 --> 00:56:43,050
if you're comparing it to any type
of dinner jacket or outdoor jacket,

918
00:56:43,051 --> 00:56:44,310
it's not horribly expensive.

919
00:56:44,311 --> 00:56:48,960
I'd say it's in the one 50 to three 50
range if I had to guess. Okay, good.

920
00:56:50,310 --> 00:56:53,610
That's fantastic.
So what else do you have in your backpack,

921
00:56:53,611 --> 00:56:57,630
which is stuffed here in the back of our
car? Right now my, in my bag of tricks,

922
00:56:58,110 --> 00:57:00,680
I have a uh,

923
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:04,690
a logic tech Bluetooth keyboard. And, uh,

924
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:07,260
just to put this in perspective,

925
00:57:07,261 --> 00:57:11,670
it is about the slightly larger
than say a paperback book,

926
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:16,700
like a five by eight inch trim paperback
book is narrow enough that I will very

927
00:57:18,091 --> 00:57:22,590
often stick it into a journal
to protect it. Uh, meaning it's,

928
00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:26,970
it's probably the width of
eight to 10 paperback pages, uh,

929
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:28,770
and it holds a charge very,
very well.

930
00:57:28,771 --> 00:57:33,771
So I use this oftentimes if I
have any issue with my laptop,

931
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:37,800
I can pair it to my iPhone,

932
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:42,860
which is a larger sized iPhone and balance
the iPhone or lean it against saying

933
00:57:43,550 --> 00:57:45,120
a,
a glass of ice tea.

934
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:48,180
And I can get any type of writing
done that I need to get done. Also,

935
00:57:48,181 --> 00:57:51,210
if I feel like taking a day trip
but not taking this backpack,

936
00:57:51,211 --> 00:57:54,870
which is one of my main pieces of
luggage and stuffed full of stuff,

937
00:57:54,871 --> 00:57:57,960
it's kind of heavy.
I can take the,

938
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:03,270
I can take the keyboard and my iPhone
and head off to some coffee shops saying

939
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:06,930
10, 15 minutes away without
carrying all of my gear with me.

940
00:58:07,030 --> 00:58:10,090
So I'm going to try to describe this
a little bit further. It's very,

941
00:58:10,091 --> 00:58:13,660
very thin and very lightweight.

942
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:18,720
It feels like it's made out of aluminum
and it has kind of a matte texture,

943
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:24,490
matte finish on it. It
feels very velvety. Um,

944
00:58:24,850 --> 00:58:28,300
and it's uh,
mostly charcoal color with white letters.

945
00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:33,710
And so this would serve as
a keyboard with a phone.

946
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:38,860
Uh, and, and the keyboard itself is pretty
large in terms of your finger spacing,

947
00:58:38,861 --> 00:58:42,430
so there'd be no cramping.
That is really cool.

948
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:43,960
Yeah,
it's a great device.

949
00:58:43,990 --> 00:58:48,990
I've had this now for I would say two
years and I have never had a technical

950
00:58:49,811 --> 00:58:51,940
fail.
So as a form of backup,

951
00:58:52,150 --> 00:58:56,140
I find it to be very cheap insurance
because as you can see in person,

952
00:58:56,410 --> 00:59:01,030
this is lightweight enough that I'm not
going to get scoliosis for having this

953
00:59:01,031 --> 00:59:02,860
as additional piece of gear.
I just stick it,

954
00:59:02,861 --> 00:59:07,780
stick it into a large format journal or
even a magazine and I can travel with

955
00:59:07,781 --> 00:59:12,280
it. Yeah, that's really cool. And
so it pairs up through Bluetooth,

956
00:59:12,281 --> 00:59:13,600
I imagine, right? That's right.

957
00:59:13,870 --> 00:59:17,610
Right. So you compare it up to a, an iPad
if you want it to as well as a phone.

958
00:59:17,611 --> 00:59:21,590
If you happen to be carried. I definitely,
yeah. So, um, what's that again?

959
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:24,700
This is a larger tech Bluetooth keyboard.
Okay.

960
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:29,720
And we'll put the exact model
in the show notes for everybody.

961
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:34,370
And uh, next up we have uh, these,

962
00:59:34,371 --> 00:59:36,170
these all kind of traveled together.

963
00:59:36,230 --> 00:59:40,640
I've very rarely take these out
of my backpack. In this case.

964
00:59:41,270 --> 00:59:44,220
This is Max earplugs,

965
00:59:44,570 --> 00:59:46,520
silicone your plugs,

966
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:51,580
which unlike foam earplugs or not inserted
into the ear canal and then left to

967
00:59:51,951 --> 00:59:52,784
expand,

968
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:57,820
these are effectively smeared over the
ear opening and you have in all caps,

969
00:59:58,370 --> 01:00:01,130
do not insert Justin uncover ear opening.

970
01:00:01,750 --> 01:00:05,480
These I found through swimmers in fact,
uh,

971
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:10,080
and they are very waxy,
uh,

972
01:00:10,130 --> 01:00:13,790
and almost look like candies,
some type of Caramel,

973
01:00:14,150 --> 01:00:19,150
but they're white colored and I find
them to block sound much more effectively

974
01:00:20,510 --> 01:00:23,450
than any type of foam your plug,

975
01:00:23,451 --> 01:00:27,050
although there are some good ones on the
market to be sure to use them just once

976
01:00:27,051 --> 01:00:32,051
or can they be reused or recycled or the
last a little bit then you have to get

977
01:00:32,781 --> 01:00:36,830
grungy or what, what, what's the
use? I definitely reuse these.

978
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:39,260
I would say if I had to guesstimate,

979
01:00:39,261 --> 01:00:42,500
I would say four to five
nights and then they'd,

980
01:00:42,630 --> 01:00:46,120
they start to lose their
adherence because they get, uh,

981
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:47,900
they get less tacky over time.

982
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:53,140
The most important feature or benefit
that I don't want to overlook is that as

983
01:00:55,341 --> 01:00:58,700
someone who tends to
rotate from back to side,

984
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:03,530
so I sleep on my back and on my side
foam earplugs won't very often hurt.

985
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:06,770
They'll get pushed into your ear
when you roll onto your side.

986
01:01:07,010 --> 01:01:11,780
That is not the case with these.
Uh, so, uh, it's over side sleepers.

987
01:01:11,781 --> 01:01:12,890
This,
these aren't real,

988
01:01:13,490 --> 01:01:17,960
a real cool tool because it allows you
to sleep on your side while you have

989
01:01:17,961 --> 01:01:22,160
these earplugs in. Definitely. And even
as someone who kind of tosses and turns,

990
01:01:22,161 --> 01:01:24,920
in my case,
I don't tend to wake up on my site,

991
01:01:24,921 --> 01:01:29,300
but I'm constantly going onto my side
and foam ear plugs off and will wake me

992
01:01:29,301 --> 01:01:30,470
out. Okay, cool.

993
01:01:30,740 --> 01:01:34,790
And is this mostly just used for
sleeping or could you use these,

994
01:01:35,180 --> 01:01:39,380
do use these for other sorts of sound,
but maybe these,

995
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:44,030
these earplugs, uh, live in each of
my bags that I tend to travel with.

996
01:01:44,031 --> 01:01:48,500
So I have, I have redundant caches
of earplugs, one in this bag,

997
01:01:48,501 --> 01:01:51,680
one in my other bag. And sometimes
I'll even have them at jackets,

998
01:01:51,710 --> 01:01:54,440
mostly for sleeping,
mostly for sleeping,

999
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:58,580
definitely heard who's sitting
on an airplane and you're
trying to read and just

1000
01:01:58,581 --> 01:02:01,310
want to drown out the sound.
Then you can use it as well for sure.

1001
01:02:01,311 --> 01:02:06,200
Or you're swimming and you want to avoid
swimmers. Okay. Right. Cool. Okay. So, um,

1002
01:02:07,550 --> 01:02:12,350
what's your fourth? A cool tool.
My fourth cool tool, and I might,

1003
01:02:12,410 --> 01:02:14,480
I might,
I might go over slightly here,

1004
01:02:14,481 --> 01:02:19,481
but by my fourth cool
tool is a neck pillow.

1005
01:02:20,310 --> 01:02:24,140
And I want one of those. I've tried
many different neck pillows. Yeah.

1006
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:29,240
Most of them are very uninspiring and
even less effective for helping me sleep.

1007
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:35,160
Uh, this, and I'll do my best here. Cabo
cut by, I believe his, the presentation,

1008
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:36,480
C A, B, e,

1009
01:02:36,481 --> 01:02:41,320
a u and it has evolution pillow written
on the side. You can see that it,

1010
01:02:41,510 --> 01:02:46,510
it's compresses down very
nicely size of a cantaloupe,

1011
01:02:47,310 --> 01:02:49,920
like a small, like a small
cantaloupe or a large grapefruit.

1012
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:52,210
Now you can certainly compress it more,
uh,

1013
01:02:52,211 --> 01:02:55,740
in the actual bag that it comes in,

1014
01:02:55,741 --> 01:02:59,910
allows you to wrap it up and then
compress it down to a smaller size.

1015
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:04,410
And it was just very nice in essence,
memory foam,

1016
01:03:04,830 --> 01:03:07,450
neck pillow that also clips in the front.

1017
01:03:07,451 --> 01:03:10,710
And what I've found is not only does it
help me sleep if I'm sitting upright,

1018
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:13,110
but it's also very,

1019
01:03:13,111 --> 01:03:16,170
very helpful for getting to
sleep when I'm laying prone,

1020
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:20,280
whether it's on an airplane or even
in a hotel room if the pillows are of

1021
01:03:20,310 --> 01:03:25,290
dubious quality.
And do you have to inflate this,

1022
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:30,030
uh, with like pumping Erin blowing
air into it or is it self expanding,

1023
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:34,380
its self expanding? Uh, so it, you
could think of it almost like a sponge,

1024
01:03:34,381 --> 01:03:37,830
like material that you can compress
down and then when you release it,

1025
01:03:38,220 --> 01:03:43,110
it's uh, inflates or I should
say rather expands automatically.

1026
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:48,120
It is one of those horseshoe
shaped items or is it a,

1027
01:03:48,251 --> 01:03:52,710
just a little kind of weds assists behind
your neck? It is a horseshoe shaped,

1028
01:03:53,130 --> 01:03:57,340
uh, if you imagine a horseshoe being
hung or around the back of your neck, uh,

1029
01:03:57,810 --> 01:04:00,180
that is the shape can clip in the front.

1030
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:05,360
And the design is such that there's a
ridge that supports basically the ACIP

1031
01:04:06,411 --> 01:04:10,530
it'll area the fact that the
base of the skull, so it's very,

1032
01:04:10,830 --> 01:04:13,380
very ergonomic. It's, it is.

1033
01:04:13,381 --> 01:04:15,930
It's the most comfortable
neck pillow that I have found.

1034
01:04:15,990 --> 01:04:20,580
And so I am pretty light. It's a little
bit bulky, but it's pretty light.

1035
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:25,380
Yeah, it's, it's lights. And
as far as neck pillows go,

1036
01:04:26,010 --> 01:04:29,610
not very bulky at all,
but if you're going to have a neck pillow,

1037
01:04:29,611 --> 01:04:30,630
generally speaking,

1038
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:34,440
in my experience at least it's going to
be inflatable and quite uncomfortable.

1039
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:38,100
Or you're going to end up with this
type of compromise. And this is,

1040
01:04:38,101 --> 01:04:40,230
this is the best I
found, right. So it does,

1041
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:44,070
it'd be you could pretty easily
disappeared Joe daypack. Oh,

1042
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:45,180
I think it absolutely could.

1043
01:04:45,181 --> 01:04:49,440
And certainly if you wanted you could
lash this to the outside of a pack.

1044
01:04:49,770 --> 01:04:52,260
I happen to have enough space
in my bag so I include it,

1045
01:04:52,261 --> 01:04:56,240
but you can lash it or hang
it on the outside. Okay. One,

1046
01:04:56,250 --> 01:04:58,650
one other cool tool that you have,

1047
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:03,030
which is more common here than I would
have expected, but in retrospect,

1048
01:05:03,031 --> 01:05:07,590
I shouldn't be surprised. It is
very, very hot here. It can get very,

1049
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:12,680
very hot and the sun is extremely powerful
to the extent that we visited a solar

1050
01:05:13,021 --> 01:05:14,610
furnace not long ago,

1051
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:19,660
that can be used to melt various objects,
absurdly high temperatures.

1052
01:05:19,830 --> 01:05:24,610
Thousand degrees centigrade.
Yeah, exactly. Uh, and uh,

1053
01:05:25,050 --> 01:05:26,110
you have,

1054
01:05:26,290 --> 01:05:31,290
well our guide has our esteemed guide as
an umbrella smart move to create shade

1055
01:05:32,081 --> 01:05:34,240
wherever he wants it.
And you have an umbrella,

1056
01:05:34,570 --> 01:05:36,630
but you made a modification
to your umbrella. Yeah.

1057
01:05:36,740 --> 01:05:39,380
So I just had an ordinary,

1058
01:05:39,381 --> 01:05:44,381
cheap Chinese black really
compact umbrella that I
carry in my little camera bag

1059
01:05:45,530 --> 01:05:50,530
all the time and I spray painted the
top of it silver so that it reflects the

1060
01:05:52,731 --> 01:05:57,380
light and it makes it a little bit cooler
on the inside because just with the

1061
01:05:57,381 --> 01:05:58,220
black umbrella,

1062
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:02,540
it tends to absorb that infrared and
reradiate it back down on your head.

1063
01:06:03,170 --> 01:06:04,003
Um,

1064
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:09,460
having a silver reflective layer announces
at least 60% of that packet to the

1065
01:06:11,001 --> 01:06:13,940
sky and it's a lot cooler. And, um,

1066
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:19,850
there are versions of the silver umbrella.
They're extremely lightweight.

1067
01:06:20,090 --> 01:06:23,660
They're not as collapsible as the ones
that have what they're made for hiking

1068
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,990
there, there, there, I think,
just call it the silver dome,

1069
01:06:26,991 --> 01:06:31,070
if I'm not mistaken and are
way only a few ounces. Um,

1070
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:35,360
and people out west, if you're
claiming even at the high altitudes,

1071
01:06:35,780 --> 01:06:36,410
um,

1072
01:06:36,410 --> 01:06:41,410
a lot of the long distance hikers now
carry and an umbrella portable shade and

1073
01:06:42,830 --> 01:06:46,030
they walk along hundreds of
shades shade files in. Um,

1074
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:50,450
and it really makes a huge difference
when you're backpacking because you can

1075
01:06:50,451 --> 01:06:55,451
really work up a sweat and the hat
doesn't allow your head to cool off.

1076
01:06:55,821 --> 01:06:57,110
But the umbrella does

1077
01:07:01,940 --> 01:07:06,170
well. There you have it folks, the Tim
Ferriss radio hour with just a handful,

1078
01:07:06,260 --> 01:07:10,220
the guests and experts I've spoken with
across more than 300 podcast episodes

1079
01:07:10,850 --> 01:07:15,850
and I myself and Jonesing to throw on
the backpack some sandals and hit the

1080
01:07:16,791 --> 01:07:19,730
road, which is exactly what
I'm doing tomorrow. So the
timing could not be better.

1081
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:23,480
And the Tim Ferriss radio hour
continues to be an experiment.

somehow dug up in the uh,
the world of the esoteric as I do.

This episode is brought to you by
re Dalia, his new book principles.

1107
01:09:01,001 --> 01:09:03,040
If you're a frequent
listener of this podcast,

1108
01:09:03,430 --> 01:09:05,320
you might recall that ray
was a guest on this show.

1109
01:09:05,321 --> 01:09:09,340
Has episode was extremely popular and in
that episode he shared his thoughts on

1110
01:09:09,341 --> 01:09:14,050
everything from how he makes investment
decisions to cryptocurrency and beyond

1111
01:09:14,410 --> 01:09:18,910
his story. Ray Daleo, you should
look him up for sure, is fascinating.

1112
01:09:18,911 --> 01:09:22,120
He started his investment company.
Some people would call it a hedge fund.

1113
01:09:22,390 --> 01:09:23,290
There are different names.

1114
01:09:23,291 --> 01:09:28,291
Bridgewater associates out of a two
bedroom apartment at each 26 now it has

1115
01:09:28,601 --> 01:09:31,840
roughly $160 billion in
assets under management.

1116
01:09:32,260 --> 01:09:37,090
Over 42 years he's built Bridgewater into
what fortune considers the fifth most

1117
01:09:37,091 --> 01:09:40,450
important private company
in the u s along the way,

1118
01:09:41,230 --> 01:09:46,090
Daleo took tons and tons of notes
on what worked, what didn't work,

1119
01:09:46,091 --> 01:09:50,860
and it was refined over time for
training purposes with his employees,

1120
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:52,120
managers and so on.

1121
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:57,490
Daleo became one of the
100 most influential people
in the world according to

1122
01:09:57,491 --> 01:09:59,890
time and one of the 100
wealthiest people in the world.

1123
01:09:59,891 --> 01:10:02,290
According to Forbes in this book,

1124
01:10:02,291 --> 01:10:07,150
principles which has a permanent spot
on my bookshelf also has blurbs and

1125
01:10:07,151 --> 01:10:11,230
testimonials from people like Bill Gates,
Michael Bloomberg, and many, many more.

1126
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:13,390
Ray shares in those pages,

1127
01:10:13,450 --> 01:10:16,990
the unconventional principles that he's
developed or find and use over the past

1128

This episode is brought to you by Linkedin
and their job recruitment platform,

1143
01:11:10,151 --> 01:11:13,410
which offers a smarter system
for the hiring process.

1144
01:11:13,830 --> 01:11:15,930
If you've ever hired anyone
or attempted to do it,

1145
01:11:15,931 --> 01:11:19,620
you know that finding the right
people can be extremely difficult.

1146
01:11:20,010 --> 01:11:23,430
And if you don't have a direct referral
from someone you trust your left to use

1147
01:11:23,431 --> 01:11:27,930
job boards that don't really offer
any real world networking approach.

1148
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:31,020
And when I mean by that is in contrast,
Linkedin,

1149
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:33,300
which is the world's largest
professional network,

1150
01:11:33,570 --> 01:11:36,990
has a built in ecosystem that allows
you to not only search for employees but

1151
01:11:36,991 --> 01:11:41,670
also interact with them and their
connections and their former employers or

1152
01:11:41,790 --> 01:11:45,510
colleagues in a way that closely
mimics real life communication.

1153
01:11:45,870 --> 01:11:50,870
More than 70% of the workforce in the u
s uses Linkedin and more than 22 million

1154
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:54,660
professionals view and apply
to linkedin every single week.

1155
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:58,080
Unlike generic job boards,
linkedin considers skills,

1156
01:11:58,081 --> 01:12:00,150
experience and location to
match you with candidates,

1157
01:12:00,420 --> 01:12:03,720
making it easier to find
quality candidates. And uh,

1158
01:12:03,780 --> 01:12:07,410
maybe above all you can directly
contact, uh, candidates,

1159
01:12:07,411 --> 01:12:11,820
connections to get a good sense of if
they are a good fit. For Your Business.
