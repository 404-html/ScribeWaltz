00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,790
Hey guys, why am I excited about tribe of
mentors? What makes it different? Well,

2
00:00:12,791 --> 00:00:17,740
this is a cookbook and encyclopedia of
tactics that are immediately actionable

3
00:00:17,741 --> 00:00:21,820
tools that are immediately actionable.
So you have probably 20 plus billionaires,

4
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,920
20 plus worldclass athletes,

5
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:28,980
every possible area you can imagine people
talking to what they do when they get

6
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,033
overwhelmed,

7
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:35,100
this specific self talk and actions they
take when they're trying to say decline

8
00:00:35,681 --> 00:00:36,491
something,
say no.

9
00:00:36,491 --> 00:00:40,270
So they don't get over committed
how they exercise in the mornings,

10
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:42,130
how they work out on the road,

11
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:47,050
how they've planned for breaking
records for 10 x 100 x thing results.

12
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,780
So with any flip of any page,

13
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:53,230
you should be able to find
something that'll change
your life and do so quickly.

14
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:56,170
So good luck and enjoy.
Hey guys,

15
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,980
if you're enjoying the tips and tactics
and how to on this channel or in the

16
00:00:59,981 --> 00:01:04,270
podcast, the Tim Ferriss show, I
made this for you, tribe of mentors,

17
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:08,620
short advice from the best in the world.
This is the book that I wanted to read.

18
00:01:08,621 --> 00:01:10,120
So I went out and I put it together,

19
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:15,310
created a dream list of 130
of the best at what they do.

20
00:01:15,311 --> 00:01:19,120
People who are icons, legends, and
ask them all the same questions.

21
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:21,100
These are people in some cases
I wanted to reach out to.

22
00:01:21,101 --> 00:01:24,850
My whole life ranges from many,
many billionaires,

23
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:27,580
cofounders of every company imaginable,

24
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,930
elite athletes ranging from surfing to
tennis to power lifting. Everything else,

25
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:37,090
country stars, actors, directors,
and you can spot the patterns.

26
00:01:37,091 --> 00:01:40,000
So some of my friends have said
this is the easiest to read,

27
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:43,000
most useful book that
I've put together yet.

28
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:47,500
So checking out tribe of mentors.com

29
00:01:47,501 --> 00:01:50,680
