1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,850
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02,851 --> 00:00:06,060
I can run flat out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:07,920
You posting a question?

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:15,500
I'm a cybernetic organism living
tissue over metal. Interstellar.

5
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:25,190
Yeah.

6
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:29,450
This episode is brought to you by 99
designs.com which is the largest online

9
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:41,450
I've used them for years and I've used
them for some very big projects like the

10
00:00:41,451 --> 00:00:43,580
book cover for the four hour body,

11
00:00:43,581 --> 00:00:46,130
which went on to become a number
one New York Times Bestseller,

12
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:50,600
translated into at least I
would say 10 1520 languages,

13
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:56,020
and I used 99 designs because I needed
results and I needed them very quickly.

14
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:01,580
So here's how it works. You need a logo, a
website, book cover, tee-shirt, car wrap,

15
00:01:01,581 --> 00:01:02,414
whatever.

16
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:07,540
You put a description on 99 designs.com
then people submit designs and in a week

17
00:01:08,391 --> 00:01:09,140
or less,

18
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:13,760
you have an original design that you
love or you get 100% of your money back.

27
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,170
Hello Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls.

28
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:49,171
This is a very exhausted Tim Ferriss
and welcome to the Tim Ferriss show.

29
00:01:50,231 --> 00:01:52,930
So glad to have you.
You know,

30
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:57,340
I am one tired some the bitch right
now and I couldn't be happier about it

31
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:02,700
because I've been flying
around the country doing
various experiments and I had

32
00:02:03,131 --> 00:02:05,290
the opportunity to go to Palm Beach,

33
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:10,291
Florida to sit at the home of Tony
Robbins and ask him just about everything

34
00:02:12,941 --> 00:02:17,890
I've ever wanted to ask him. And this
is a very special interview for me.

35
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:23,220
This is the interview of the conversation
I've wanted to have for 15 years.

36
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:27,280
Now that I'm back in SF,
gathering myself,

37
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,140
drinking some what appears to be laughing
coyote t I have no idea what's in.

38
00:02:32,141 --> 00:02:36,160
It could be all sorts of drugs,
psilocybin and,

39
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:41,280
and I'm thrilled to be putting this
out there for you because Tony is a

40
00:02:43,001 --> 00:02:45,010
fascinating character.
For those of you who don't know him,

41
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:49,630
he has consulted or advised
leaders including Nelson
Mandela, Mikhail Gorbachev,

42
00:02:49,631 --> 00:02:51,910
Margaret Thatcher,
and Mother Teresa.

43
00:02:51,911 --> 00:02:56,410
He's consulted members of two royal
families, the U S congress, US Army,

44
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,273
US marines,

45
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,280
three US presidents including and other
celebrity clients would include names,

46
00:03:02,831 --> 00:03:06,490
you know like Serena Williams, Andre
Agassi, Greg Norman, of course,

47
00:03:06,491 --> 00:03:07,324
the golf legend,

48
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:11,630
Leonardo Dicaprio and Oprah
Winfrey who calls him super human.

49
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:17,070
The stat that always just sends my head
spinning is that Tony has developed and

50
00:03:18,851 --> 00:03:21,490
produced five award winning infomercials.

51
00:03:21,491 --> 00:03:26,491
That's of course how a lot of people came
to know of him and these infomercials

52
00:03:26,681 --> 00:03:30,640
have continuously aired on
average every 30 minutes,

53
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:35,500
24 hours a day, somewhere in
North America since check it out,

54
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:40,450
April,
1989 it's just Tony TV out there,

55
00:03:40,451 --> 00:03:42,460
24 seven insanity.

56
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:48,420
This particular conversation is
broken into basically three parts.

57
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:54,150
The first third of our very long
conversation involves me asking him the

58
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:58,840
questions I have always been dying to
ask him ever since I first was exposed to

59
00:03:58,841 --> 00:04:03,250
his material. And I explained a lot of the
background, which is kind of hilarious.

60
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:07,300
Uh, when we get started, the second,

61
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:11,500
third and the third,
third a wood.

62
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:15,340
And of course along the way we
talk about his daily routines,

63
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:20,490
the types of questions that he asks
worldclass performers and so on the ladder

64
00:04:20,801 --> 00:04:23,070
portions of this,
uh,

65
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,980
focus on what Tony has
been researching and,

66
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,040
and really teasing apart and analyzing
for the last several decades,

67
00:04:34,151 --> 00:04:35,530
but especially the last four years.

68
00:04:35,531 --> 00:04:38,770
And that is how do you
master the game of money?

69
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:44,050
Why is there so much financial illiteracy
and how do you stack the deck so that

70
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:44,681
you can win?

71
00:04:44,681 --> 00:04:48,490
Because there's a lot of hygiene and
there's a lot of nonsense out there.

72
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:53,620
How do you actually invest? What do you
do with your money? And it's a huge topic.

73
00:04:53,621 --> 00:04:58,621
But he has interviewed and in fact coached
some of the most unbelievable minds

74
00:04:59,021 --> 00:05:02,740
in the world of finance and investing.
I couldn't believe the list, uh,

75
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,050
including people like Paul Tudor Jones.

76
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,080
Ray Daleo is of course a AA,

77
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:13,160
a whiz in the world of
hedge funds. And, uh,

78
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:17,290
the list is unbelievable.
Carl Icahn, David Swensen,

79
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:20,800
who turned 1,000,000,002,
I think 23 billion for Yale,

80
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,740
some curious characters like mark, Doctor
Doom, favor, uh, sir, John Templeton,

81
00:05:26,741 --> 00:05:29,710
Kyle Bass, who became
very, very famous for, uh,

82
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:33,790
in effect predicting and shorting,
uh,

83
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:38,410
the, the subprime crisis, or
at least he made his fortune,

84
00:05:38,411 --> 00:05:42,280
one of his fortunes in, uh,
in, in seeing that through,

85
00:05:42,281 --> 00:05:46,820
through the looking glass.
These are, these are the, the,

86
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,920
the Navy Seals, the, uh,

87
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,610
the, the, the top of the top.

88
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:59,270
And he has been able to ask them just
about everything that you would want to

89
00:05:59,271 --> 00:05:59,870
ask them.

90
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:04,870
And a lot of what Tony's going to say
is controversial or counterintuitive and

91
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:09,440
no doubt you'll disagree with some
of what he says, but I guarantee you,

92
00:06:09,441 --> 00:06:11,390
even if you don't care about investing,

93
00:06:11,391 --> 00:06:13,940
where you think you don't care
about investing. And by the way,

94
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:17,720
if you've decided not to
think about investing, that
is a decision and investing.

95
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:21,630
I guarantee that if you listen
to this entire conversation, uh,

96
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,010
which I plan to listen to over and over,
and it's,

97
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:29,030
it has a lot of information that you
will take away at least one or two things

98
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:33,800
from Tony that lead you to say,
Holy Shit,

99
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:36,920
I've never looked at that
aspect of my life that way.

100
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:42,080
And it'll turn things upside down and
you will walk away with a completely

101
00:06:42,081 --> 00:06:47,081
different Lens through which you
can look at how you're living,

102
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:50,030
how you're handling your business.

103
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:55,450
And I think you will find tremendous
value from this single interview.

104
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,500
So I will leave it at that. You
know, I don't want to oversell it.

105
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:03,220
I will say that for me,
uh,

106
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:07,820
Tony can be an intimidating guy
just in sheer size. He's a big dude.

107
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,180
And he can actually Paul my entire face.

108
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:13,700
And now we have a photograph
of that that I'll share,

109
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:16,220
but I'd get into that in the interview.
Uh,

110
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:19,040
he's also very seasoned pro and
I have a lot of respect for him.

111
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:21,290
So it takes me five or 10
minutes, I'd say. Yeah,

112
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:24,740
let's just say 10 minutes to find my
feet in this interview when we hit our

113
00:07:24,741 --> 00:07:29,330
stride. Then all sorts of gems come out
and there's a lot of good material in the

114
00:07:29,331 --> 00:07:32,570
beginning, but give it some time, be
patient, listen to this whole thing.

115
00:07:32,571 --> 00:07:36,500
It is worth your time.
So without further ado,

116
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:41,180
I think I've had too much laughing.
Coyote t here's Tony Robbins,

117
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,590
our ladies and gentlemen,
this is Tim Ferriss.

118
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,720
Welcome to another episode
of the Tim Ferriss show.

119
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:52,470
I have a very exciting episode
for you and a very exciting guest,

120
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,920
Mister Tony Robbins. Tony, thank you for
having me in your home of all places.

121
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,910
I'm glad to be home

122
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:01,240
was lost to have you here as well.

123
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,050
And we have many different topics.

124
00:08:04,051 --> 00:08:08,070
I have many different questions
I'd love to delve into. Of course,

125
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:13,071
I perhaps unbeknownst to a lot of my fans
have a long history with Tony Robbins,

126
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:15,210
but not in person.
This is the first,

127
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,540
and for those of you who don't
know some of the background,

128
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:22,860
when I first graduated from school and
move to silicon valley to chase the

129
00:08:22,861 --> 00:08:27,390
billions that seemed just that
there were being handed out and 99,

130
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,210
uh,
I work in 99,

131
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,690
they were in a way and I
was driving a hand me down,

132
00:08:33,691 --> 00:08:35,850
beat up green minivan from my mom.

133
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:39,330
The seat's got stolen from
inside or at least the back.

134
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:43,410
So all my coworkers started harassing
me and calling it the molester immobile

135
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:48,810
and the job, the company didn't
seem to be a long term fit for me.

136
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:52,380
And when I was on a road trip at
one point I bought personal power.

137
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:56,190
May have been personal power too. And I
started listening to, to and from work,

138
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,880
my commute, which is terrible for
those who don't know the bay area,

139
00:08:59,881 --> 00:09:02,930
if you're on 101 in between San Jose NSF,

140
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:07,970
it's a horrible and ultimately that was
one of the catalysts for me starting my

141
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:11,190
first company.
So knowing all that you've done,

142
00:09:11,191 --> 00:09:14,400
that really touches me completely cause
you're an inspiring character to me.

143
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,800
Oh not the four work week cause I don't,

144
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,730
I'm looking for the four
hours sleep week stage.

145
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:22,880
I'd like to be able to pull that
one off. But, but really I think

146
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,900
the way you attack subjects and that's
what you do, you don't look at them,

147
00:09:26,901 --> 00:09:30,410
you go after mastery of them and the
way you experiment and the way you

148
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,570
constantly dig underneath to
find the organizing principles.

149
00:09:32,571 --> 00:09:35,570
I feel a kinship with you and we're in
different stages of life and things like

150
00:09:35,571 --> 00:09:35,721
that.

151
00:09:35,721 --> 00:09:39,050
But I have enormous respect for you and
I don't feel that way about everybody.

152
00:09:39,051 --> 00:09:40,820
I like everybody.
They'll respectively buddy,

153
00:09:40,821 --> 00:09:44,940
you deserve the respect cause you go deep.
Most people are really there.

154
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,310
They're surface level and what they do.

155
00:09:46,311 --> 00:09:49,010
So I'm excited to chat with you and
see what can come out of this group.

156
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,890
Thank you for sure.
And I have of course,

157
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:54,520
a bunch of self interested questions
that I think will also be interesting to

158
00:09:54,521 --> 00:09:56,170
other folks, hopefully. Uh,

159
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:01,200
but what's always impressed me about
your entire career and the results that

160
00:10:01,421 --> 00:10:03,670
you've achieved is,
uh,

161
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:07,240
how far you've been able to take
it in terms of working with, say,

162
00:10:07,241 --> 00:10:11,300
the top 1% of performers
in the world. And, uh,

163
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:15,580
I read in your, your new book, which
everyone should take a look at.

164
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:19,510
We'll be delving into it a lot more as
we progressed in the interview. But, uh,

165
00:10:19,511 --> 00:10:22,270
there was a quote from, uh, uh,

166
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:27,220
Mr Benioff salesforce and who
credits you with effectively,

167
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:30,250
if there were no Tony Robbins,
there would be no salesforce.com.

168
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,310
It'll be quick told me exaggerated,
but he kind of walked me through this.

169
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:37,000
It started very much like, dude,
what's up Ma on the freeway?

170
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:42,250
And you get these, uh, you're able to, uh,

171
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:47,580
reach such a high caliber of individual
when you meet with such people,

172
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:51,610
whether they're presidents, athletes
like Serena Williams, Agassi,

173
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:56,410
actors like Hugh Jackman, whoever it
might be. Uh, you'd Benioff's quote was,

174
00:10:56,411 --> 00:10:56,561
you know,

175
00:10:56,561 --> 00:10:59,770
Tony said to me that the quality of my
life was the quality of my questions.

176
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:04,690
So what I would be curious to know is
when you meet with these top performers,

177
00:11:04,691 --> 00:11:07,660
where do you start?
What are the questions that you ask them?

178
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,830
Well,
I ask questions when I meet them.

179
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:12,770
The question I want to ask before
I meet them is who are they?

180
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,320
What are they made of?
What are they after?

181
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:18,980
What's preventing them from
getting it where their wounds?

182
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:23,030
What is their deepest pride? Not in a
negative way. Like what are they proud of?

183
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:26,780
How to find out as much as I can in
advance so that I can be really effective

184
00:11:26,781 --> 00:11:30,290
and efficient when I meet them. When you
meet somebody, just yourself, myself,

185
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,800
the most viable thing
we have is our times.

186
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:33,590
I tried to be beyond respectful of that,

187
00:11:33,591 --> 00:11:37,970
but also I load my brain with all of
the distinctions I can so that when they

188
00:11:37,971 --> 00:11:41,480
enter into an interaction with someone,
the more engaged I have,

189
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:46,160
a disproportionate amount of
information, ideas, insights,

190
00:11:46,161 --> 00:11:47,360
wisdom available to me,

191
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,820
and then I can react to what's
really happening in this moment.

192
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:54,050
So I have what I think in advance and then
I have what the moment shows me and I,

193
00:11:54,051 --> 00:11:57,730
I think a blend of that is really valuable
because in the moment people can show

194
00:11:57,731 --> 00:11:59,790
up in all kinds of ways, right?
You know, somebody could show up.

195
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,560
The meanest person on earth can
be kind in the moment. Yeah.

196
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:06,630
The kindest person can be very mean
in the moment. So I really, I like to,

197
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,840
I like to grab both those.

198
00:12:07,841 --> 00:12:12,070
And then what I want to do when I meet
them is I want to try and understand what

199
00:12:12,071 --> 00:12:16,660
is it that they really need, not only what
they want, right? Because what you want,

200
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,200
I'm sure you've experienced this. I
have in my life, gotten what you want.

201
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:22,810
Then you're like, is that
like what the hell? Um,

202
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:25,300
because what really makes us
fulfilled as human beings,

203
00:12:25,301 --> 00:12:28,210
what we need and there's only so many
needs. So I dig under what the needs are.

204
00:12:28,211 --> 00:12:31,600
I look at what's their model of the world,
how they approach meeting those needs.

205
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,810
And every model has limitations and
challenges. Mine, yours, anybody's.

206
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:38,330
And so that tells me before I even meet
them where the real challenges and that

207
00:12:38,331 --> 00:12:41,530
I listened for what the surface
challenges and my goal is solve a surface

208
00:12:41,531 --> 00:12:44,800
challenge, but also give them more
than they bargained for software.

209
00:12:44,801 --> 00:12:45,634
The deeper challenge.

210
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,160
And ultimately my goal is that they
have a greater quality of life.

211
00:12:48,161 --> 00:12:51,370
And most of the people I work with
have an extraordinary quality of life.

212
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:54,550
They may not realize it, they may have
forgotten it ran and lost track of it.

213
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:57,440
Unless I'm dealing with somebody, which
I also deal with. It was, you know,

214
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:00,790
coming back from Afghanistan with PTSD
and they got light sensitivity and they

215
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:01,630
can't sleep at night.

216
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:04,030
They wake up in cold sweats and they're
shaking or they're talking to me,

217
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,760
that's a different game. Boom. You know,
that something's got to be dealt with.

218
00:13:06,761 --> 00:13:09,070
In a different way. But when you're
talking about peak performers,

219
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:12,880
their challenges are usually
they're hungry for more, right?

220
00:13:12,881 --> 00:13:15,040
That's the nature of probably
people listening to this.

221
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,570
They're going to listen to Ferris,

222
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:20,350
they're gonna listen for more like gimme
something beyond what everybody else is

223
00:13:20,351 --> 00:13:20,891
talking about.

224
00:13:20,891 --> 00:13:23,590
And then you're always seeking to try
and find that by not limiting it to

225
00:13:23,591 --> 00:13:24,730
yourself.
Same as myself.

226
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,180
Let's go find whoever's best in these
areas and what's pulled together and let's

227
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:32,680
find the organizing principles
that quantify this. So
I'm looking to figure out,

228
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:33,041
you know,

229
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:36,580
what does that more that they want and
or what is it that's stopping them?

230
00:13:36,581 --> 00:13:39,490
And then I, I go into the experience
and just absorb what's there.

231
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,490
And the combination of the two is
how I'm able to usually get pretty

232
00:13:42,491 --> 00:13:44,110
extraordinary results.
But without the prep,

233
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,280
when most people know about me
at the level of prep on you,

234
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:51,820
like I can get up and my pinky do six
days in a row without a no turning that

235
00:13:51,821 --> 00:13:54,430
nature at this stage. That's not
intelligence. That's experience.

236
00:13:54,431 --> 00:13:59,350
That's the 40,000 hours, not 10,000
hours. You know, over the years. But, um,

237
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:02,800
I still prep because I, what I
do is I, and my nervous system,

238
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:05,350
that knowledge base of what I want
to be able to serve somebody with,

239
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,660
I try to bring that to the surface.
So it's readily available.

240
00:14:07,661 --> 00:14:10,600
It's the difference between emotional
intelligence and what I call emotional

241
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:12,650
fitness.
Emotional intelligence is the key.

242
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:15,010
Intelligence is the capability
to deliver something.

243
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,770
Fitness is the readiness to be
able to make that happen. So I,

244
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:21,820
I'm more interested in being emotionally
fit or being emotionally fit for that

245
00:14:21,821 --> 00:14:22,654
person in the moment.

246
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:27,270
And when you, when you interact
with people, for instance,
Paul Tudor Jones, yes.

247
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:32,420
A legendary investor and trader or Agassi
or anyone who's at the peak of their

248
00:14:33,251 --> 00:14:36,640
game and suddenly enters a slump. Yes. Uh,

249
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:41,740
what are the commonalities, if any, that
you've spotted in the best of the best,

250
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:45,280
who then sees for a period of
time being the best of the best?

251
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:47,620
What triggers that type of down slope?

252
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:50,030
Everyone has got different triggers.
There's some common patterns.

253
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:54,950
One pattern is so well that
you go beyond your vision and,

254
00:14:54,951 --> 00:14:59,210
uh, you know, it's the astronaut syndrome.
You know, what do you do? Uh, when you've,

255
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:02,510
you know, you're 31 years old, you
flew to the top of the mountain,

256
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,150
right on top of literally look back
at the earth and saw that picture.

257
00:15:05,151 --> 00:15:07,910
We've all seen photograph come back,
shake the president's hand,

258
00:15:07,911 --> 00:15:10,670
had the ticker tape parade, and okay, now
what you do with the rest of your life.

259
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,480
And so when most of those astronauts,
if you know their histories,

260
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,650
they went through some really
tough times somewhere, alcoholics,

261
00:15:15,651 --> 00:15:19,640
I've got addicted to prescription drugs.
Um, and so, you know, in some cases,

262
00:15:19,641 --> 00:15:21,950
that's why I enter people's
worlds as they've done so well.

263
00:15:21,951 --> 00:15:26,210
They've called the market, you know,
almost hour by hour a week in advance,

264
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,010
and they made more money in a day.

265
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,920
The most people have ever dreamed of
when everybody all was lost their shirt.

266
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,080
And everybody's wanting to know
what to do. Okay, I've done that.

267
00:15:33,081 --> 00:15:35,960
Now what do I do after I've called the
market during the worst day in history?

268
00:15:35,961 --> 00:15:36,590
You know,

269
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:41,590
most people lose momentum then or they
get distracted cause it's like we need

270
00:15:41,901 --> 00:15:44,780
something to go for it. We all need
what I call a compelling future.

271
00:15:44,781 --> 00:15:48,020
Something that will get us up early,
keep us up late and excite us,

272
00:15:48,021 --> 00:15:51,170
at least the nature of a high performer.
And if you don't have that,

273
00:15:51,171 --> 00:15:55,220
why it feels very dead for those people.
And so, um, you know your presence,

274
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:56,990
United States.
I remember Bill Clinton's tank to me.

275
00:15:56,991 --> 00:15:58,790
I was with them in Aspen and um,

276
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,670
it was at a fundraiser and he asked me
to come visit him and then he threw me in

277
00:16:01,671 --> 00:16:02,900
the cards to come down the hill with me.

278
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,300
It was on those serene moments
and the lights are flashing,

279
00:16:05,301 --> 00:16:07,310
would come down red mountain
and Aspen if you know the area.

280
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:11,240
And he sit across from me and it's right
after the blue dress incident to come

281
00:16:11,241 --> 00:16:16,010
out. And uh, he's a Tony and nurses, like,
I'm still so young. He said, you know,

282
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,270
what am I going to do when I leave?
You know,

283
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,510
you know what I'm going
to do in my fifties.

284
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,180
This is the wild thing as if I were you,

285
00:16:23,181 --> 00:16:25,010
I'd get the hell out quick because
he's talking about, you know,

286
00:16:25,011 --> 00:16:27,410
I run a third time if I could
and I was teasing him about it,

287
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,550
but he found a compelling future and
Bill Clinton today as something even

288
00:16:31,551 --> 00:16:33,030
greater in his life that he's going for.

289
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:38,140
So the slump shows when people outrun
division or the slump can show when they

290
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:43,541
meet their vision but it's not fulfilling
or the slumps shows when people just

291
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:47,450
end up developing some patterns
that are unaware of that cost them.

292
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:51,410
And it can be so in such a small thing
with an athlete that can occur. Um,

293
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:55,100
and sometimes it shows like a tiger
woods when something happens in their

294
00:16:55,101 --> 00:16:57,020
emotional life and while they try to say,

295
00:16:57,021 --> 00:17:00,260
I'm an athlete here and I'm a human
being over there, they don't separate.

296
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:03,470
And so what I got to do in
those situations, regardless
of what triggered it,

297
00:17:03,471 --> 00:17:06,650
is I've got to come in and get them
to re anchor in their nervous system.

298
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:09,350
What made them so effective.
And then you understand Myelin,

299
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:12,260
the idea that the more you do something,
the more you wire yourself.

300
00:17:12,261 --> 00:17:17,210
It's like the mile end of the
white portion of the brain.
It's almost like using,

301
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,310
if I do something over and over again,

302
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:23,300
I literally wire myself with this mile
and I'm, it's like having high speed,

303
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,520
you know, cable in there or
whatever the appropriate,

304
00:17:25,521 --> 00:17:28,250
I don't know what it is anymore with
high highspeed really is these days,

305
00:17:28,251 --> 00:17:31,340
the proper term. But versus,
you know, having dialect.

306
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:34,340
If you do something over and over again
and you can process so much more rapidly.

307
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,130
So I will find what,
where's that Myelin and that person,

308
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:41,450
what specific pattern we'll hook them
back up again to that part of their brain

309
00:17:41,451 --> 00:17:44,690
where it's effortless to that part of
the brain where they in state and they

310
00:17:44,691 --> 00:17:47,960
don't even think, you know, Andre
Agassi was decades and decades ago.

311
00:17:47,961 --> 00:17:51,240
He'd been number one in the world and
all of a sudden he dropped everyone was

312
00:17:51,241 --> 00:17:56,210
number 19 or something at that stage. It's
like 90, 91, 92, whenever it was. And um,

313
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:57,510
and nothing worked.

314
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:01,110
Nothing worked because he kept working
on his swing and he kept working on his

315
00:18:01,111 --> 00:18:04,440
wrist and he was really upset
with his father who was his coach.

316
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,780
There's all these dynamics going,
nobody wants to talk about,

317
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:10,050
he was actually the point that you've
shared later on that he was thinking about

318
00:18:10,051 --> 00:18:11,730
quitting, you know, playing the game.

319
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,490
This is really early in
his career and you know,

320
00:18:14,491 --> 00:18:18,420
he had gotten injured and Andre was very
frustrated and Brooke shields brought

321
00:18:18,421 --> 00:18:21,470
them to me. They were just
dating at that time and said,

322
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,400
I don't need positive thinking.
And he said, you know what?

323
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:26,120
You know Tony is not positive thinking
he's going to show you these strategies.

324
00:18:26,121 --> 00:18:29,850
So he comes to me, I sit down with
them and I said, I said, Andre,

325
00:18:29,851 --> 00:18:31,290
he's telling me about how he's doing this.
I said,

326
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,530
think of a time you hit the tennis ball
perfectly. I said, don't think about it.

327
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:35,610
Go to,
and I got them in state,

328
00:18:35,611 --> 00:18:37,920
got them kind of in that place
where the Myelin is being fired off.

329
00:18:37,921 --> 00:18:40,740
And then I said to him, okay, you feel
that you feel that you got to go, said,

330
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,790
what are you thinking about
your wrist? He says, no. I said,

331
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,080
how the hell would you think you would
ever get back to that peak of I'm

332
00:18:46,081 --> 00:18:47,970
focusing on your wrist,
right?

333
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:51,990
So I've got to get them back into
the pattern that made it work.

334
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:54,720
And then oftentimes I've got to help
them resolve some other issue that's

335
00:18:54,721 --> 00:18:57,960
distracting them. That is something
else in their life that's pulling them,

336
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:01,770
pulling them apart from peak performance.
His story is an amazing one. Uh,

337
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:05,130
open the autobiography is one of the
things that while I've ever read,

338
00:19:05,131 --> 00:19:06,970
that's why it's such a fantastic book.

339
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:12,640
Looking at the longevity
of your career, the, the,

340
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:18,010
the scope and scale of
the Tony Robbins Empire,

341
00:19:18,011 --> 00:19:22,270
so to speak, uh, the s your
endurance has really impressed me.

342
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:27,160
And so I'm wondering, after
these decades, what are your,

343
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:29,590
some of your daily routines?
For instance,

344
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:33,820
what do you typically eat for breakfast
if it's up to you? I have salad and fish.

345
00:19:33,821 --> 00:19:38,690
It's like standard. I'm boring as hell
because I just know it's fuel. Yeah.

346
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:43,260
I, before I met my wife, we've been
together for more than 15 years. Um,

347
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:46,870
I was completely anal. I was
like, I hadn't had chocolate.

348
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:50,680
I had an ice cream and like 15
years. Right. I was just, just crazy.

349
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,020
And then she came into my life
and I forgot. I thought, God,

350
00:19:53,021 --> 00:19:55,960
this woman is incredible. She's a
phlebotomist. So she does the blood,

351
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:59,740
she's an acupuncturist, she's an
attrition or have these green drinks.

352
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:02,320
And we had this lunch and that's
where it shorted a hot fudge Sundae.

353
00:20:02,321 --> 00:20:05,560
And I don't what and the hell are you
doing? She goes, live in you basket.

354
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:12,400
So she loosened my ass up just because
I loved her. So I, I, you know,

355
00:20:12,401 --> 00:20:16,660
she calls it zigging and zagging. We Zig,
zig, zig, and then she's ags are we zag?

356
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:19,030
Um, and when I was first
with her, I was like,

357
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:22,730
you're Zagat we were traveling
through Europe. You don't
Roman Italy and, and, uh,

358
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:26,950
you know, various parts of France, south
of France. And I was like, you know,

359
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:30,220
you seem to be zagging every day.
And she goes, well, I'm on vacation.

360
00:20:30,221 --> 00:20:32,500
And then later on we were traveling
or something. I said, you know,

361
00:20:32,501 --> 00:20:34,930
the problem is we're always traveling.
So the girl was on vacation,

362
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,570
but she's fit is how great shape.
But I,

363
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:42,630
I'm fish fishing and salad.
I'm um, I'm uh, you know, uh,

364
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:47,060
Hi Greens, you know, protein
type of guy, very low carbs. Um,

365
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:47,890
and my,

366
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:52,570
but my regimen is I start with something
to strengthen a Joel and nervous system

367
00:20:52,571 --> 00:20:55,210
every fucking day. Aye.
Well, sometimes he's into,

368
00:20:55,211 --> 00:20:56,870
and I'll go in the hot poles and you know,

369
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:58,840
I'm fortunate I have to have multiple
homes. My home in Sun Valley,

370
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:00,520
I've natural hot pools
that come out of ground,

371
00:21:00,521 --> 00:21:03,490
just steaming hot and I won't hop poles.
And then I go there in the river.

372
00:21:03,491 --> 00:21:06,340
Here I go into a 57 degree, uh, you know,

373
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,810
plunge pool that I have
and I have one every home.

374
00:21:07,811 --> 00:21:10,540
I have every single bag immediately
upon waking up, waking up,

375
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:14,050
and we're just like, boom.
Every cell in the body wakes up.

376
00:21:14,051 --> 00:21:18,400
And it's also just like training my
nervous system to rock that. There is no,

377
00:21:18,401 --> 00:21:21,280
I don't give a shit how you feel. This
is how you perform, but so what you do,

378
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,340
even when I'm taking vacation, I do it.
It's just, I don't know. Now I like it.

379
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,870
I like that.

380
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:31,050
That simple discipline that reminds me
that level of strength and intensity

381
00:21:31,241 --> 00:21:34,570
that's available at any moment. Even if
I'm relaxing, I can bring that up at will.

382
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:39,120
It's the Mylan. I also have a cryotherapy
unit and all my homes do you have,

383
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:42,730
you've tried cryotherapy.
You know what it is and then you can,

384
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:44,771
I can,

385
00:21:44,771 --> 00:21:48,310
I can put the two words together and I'd
probably get my God with all that you

386
00:21:48,311 --> 00:21:51,700
do. You're gonna love this. I'm surprised.
I'm glad I'm teaching Tim Ferriss up.

387
00:21:51,701 --> 00:21:56,050
The, I'm not the first style is
that suck ice mouth suck. Trust me.

388
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:59,350
I'm on stage and the weekend I do my,
unless at least power than program.

389
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:02,200
Three days it's 50 hours.
You have been to that.

390
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:04,690
You got to come as my guest on events.
I would love to,

391
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08,200
but I'm going to give you an idea of
people won't sit for a three hour movie

392
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:12,220
that somebody spent $300 million on
and I got like usher, Oprah going on.

393
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:15,100
You know, Tony, I love you. But two hours,
most of them are doing 12 hours later,

394
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,950
you know,
Oprah standing on a chair going,

395
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,230
this is the most incredible experience of
my life on Kevin. I, she was like, dude,

396
00:22:20,231 --> 00:22:24,690
I'm in for all three days. But for me
one of those days alone, um, I, you know,

397
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:29,560
I wear odometer and I'm a fitbit and
it's 26 and a half miles on average. Wow.

398
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:31,120
We start at eight 30 in the morning.

399
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:34,060
I finish at one 30 or two
there's one one hour break.

400
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:36,970
People can vote with their feet
and no one leaves. You know,

401
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:42,030
there's on average 20 minutes of just
crazy ass standing ovations music stuff

402
00:22:42,131 --> 00:22:44,500
that happens at the end cause people
are just, it's like a rock concert.

403
00:22:44,501 --> 00:22:48,980
It's so much fun. But the wear
and tear of doing, you know,

404
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:52,360
basic good marathon, half marathon with
the marathon on the weekend back to back,

405
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:55,450
it's pretty intense. And so over the years
it's like the inflammation in my body,

406
00:22:55,451 --> 00:22:57,880
the demands, I've had to do
everything I can to reduce it.

407
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:59,830
Nothing has come close to cryotherapy.

408
00:22:59,831 --> 00:23:03,210
Cryotherapy has developed in
Poland and eastern Germany, uh,

409
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:06,640
and the eastern bloc countries.
And what it does is it uses nitrogen.

410
00:23:06,641 --> 00:23:09,160
So there's no water.
And unlike an ice bath,

411
00:23:09,161 --> 00:23:11,440
what you're doing going to get spasms
and you've got to do, I'm still right,

412
00:23:11,441 --> 00:23:13,840
if you're a boxer, you're a
runner, you're an athlete. Um,

413
00:23:13,841 --> 00:23:17,740
which is what I would do before. Hated
them. There's no, none of that process,

414
00:23:17,741 --> 00:23:22,150
but it reduces your body temperature to
minus two 20 Fahrenheit and you do it

415
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:25,960
three minutes and it's mind boggling.
In fact,

416
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:30,760
I have one here and I'll throw you in at
the end if you want. I have a unit here,

417
00:23:30,761 --> 00:23:34,390
I'll do it for you. Um, but what it does
is, and I did about three times a week,

418
00:23:34,391 --> 00:23:37,010
usually when I, when I come back
from an event, I do it, you know,

419
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:37,983
a couple of days in a row.

420
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:40,720
And what it does is it takes all the
inflammation out of your body and you know

421
00:23:40,721 --> 00:23:44,830
what inflammation does to every aspect of
body and the breakdown. Um, but it also,

422
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,080
it's sends an emergency
signals to your brain.

423
00:23:47,081 --> 00:23:50,360
It's like resetting your neurological
system cause your brain goes and you're

424
00:23:50,361 --> 00:23:52,880
going to freeze to death. It
sounds terrific. It really isn't.

425
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:56,460
You'll find out it's not that painful
going in my cold plunge at 57 degrees,

426
00:23:56,461 --> 00:23:59,120
it feels more jolting then this does even,
that's cool.

427
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,540
Even though it's colder because you know,

428
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:04,880
the fluid of water versus the nitrogen
erectors different. The conductivity.

429
00:24:04,881 --> 00:24:09,280
Exactly. Right. And so, but what happens
is you're nervous has, gets a signal.

430
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:12,170
It's like everything in your body
connects cause it's like emergency,

431
00:24:12,171 --> 00:24:14,120
our report is a reset
of your nervous system.

432
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:17,210
You get an explosion of endorphins
in your body, which is really cool.

433
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,010
So you get this natural high,

434
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:22,880
you feel this physiological transformation
and you get the reduction of

435
00:24:22,881 --> 00:24:26,180
inflammation. What it was
used for originally, it's
for people with arthritis.

436
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:29,120
And I found my first one because my mother
in law was be calling up and she was

437
00:24:29,121 --> 00:24:31,910
just crying and pain and no
medication was enough for her.

438
00:24:31,911 --> 00:24:33,680
And I hate somebody medicated anyway.

439
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:37,520
And so I started doing this research and
it just started to come to the u s and

440
00:24:37,521 --> 00:24:40,300
now daily Lakers,
most football teams that gets,

441
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:43,380
it's spreading like wildfire
amongst the sports teams. Um,

442
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:44,840
and so that's where it took off.

443
00:24:44,841 --> 00:24:49,370
So I went and got her one and I mean
it took her I think three sessions and

444
00:24:49,371 --> 00:24:51,350
she's out of pain and now there's
none of the day she's in pain.

445
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,080
And now most people can't
afford to go buy a unit,

446
00:24:54,081 --> 00:24:56,870
but there are local places now they're
popping up all over the United States

447
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:59,420
where athletes go, where people
go, where people go for a juvenile.

448
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,980
It's amazing for the skin. Um, but is
one of the great things. I got it first,

449
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,520
I got it from me and
then now I'm addicted.

450
00:25:04,521 --> 00:25:06,110
So I've got whenever had three minutes.

451
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:09,360
What type of unit, do you know the, the
actual model and the brand that you use?

452
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:12,400
Uh, yeah, there's two of them.
The best out there and it's, um,

453
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:16,550
it was at Java all the junk guy,
Jay Unka I think it is.

454
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:19,250
I'll get it for you when we go downstairs
and I'll put it in the show notes if

455
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,160
anybody wants to do it. But also
like if you're in La, there's,

456
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:25,490
there's a place there on, um, well I'll
give to you and putting your notes,

457
00:25:25,491 --> 00:25:28,490
a couple of locations there. There's some
great guys. I'm getting another unit.

458
00:25:28,491 --> 00:25:31,650
This is brand new home. So, um,
and I'm building a, you know,

459
00:25:31,651 --> 00:25:34,700
an additional guest house in
additional size gym and so forth.

460
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,230
I'm going to eat it though.
That's better.

461
00:25:36,231 --> 00:25:38,690
This one is just goes up to your neck and,

462
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,940
but I'm getting one that
encloses you a full room.

463
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:45,170
And the reason is about 70% of your
nerves receptors are from the neck up.

464
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:49,070
So when you step into one of those, it's
even more powerful. But other than that,

465
00:25:49,071 --> 00:25:54,000
I don't do much unique or
different with my life. I'm attire.

466
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:58,010
Uh, the, so you have the,

467
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:01,430
either the sort of contrast therapy
that you mentioned, the hot, cold,

468
00:26:01,431 --> 00:26:06,350
the cryotherapy. Yes. You have
salad and fish. How far after,

469
00:26:06,351 --> 00:26:09,770
so what does, if you were to kind of
Spec out the first hour of your day?

470
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:13,880
Well, the first, the first,
every day, um, I do the water,

471
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:16,700
I'd taken the environment and then the
first thing I do before I do anything

472
00:26:16,701 --> 00:26:20,370
else, my day is I do what I call
priming. Priming to me is, uh,

473
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:23,210
different than meditating.
I've never been really a meditator per se.

474
00:26:23,211 --> 00:26:24,080
I know the value of it,

475
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:28,100
but the idea for me of sitting still and
having no thoughts just didn't really

476
00:26:28,101 --> 00:26:31,820
work out for me. It was just a pain
in the ass. And I just thought,

477
00:26:31,821 --> 00:26:35,660
it's not natural. Right? It's like that's
where it works. But when I'm in nature,

478
00:26:35,661 --> 00:26:36,950
I feel that form of meditation.

479
00:26:36,951 --> 00:26:40,040
When I stand on stage and someone
stands up and my brain, it's done.

480
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:43,250
I don't even know what it is, but person
suicidal, I've never lost a suicide,

481
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:46,950
for example. And you know, 37 years, knock
on wood, it doesn't mean I won't someday,

482
00:26:46,951 --> 00:26:49,230
but I never have at a thousands.
And we followed up with them.

483
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:52,320
So it's like there's something
that comes through me and it's,

484
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:56,100
and it's quite meditative. It's like I
experienced it as a witness, you know,

485
00:26:56,101 --> 00:26:59,370
afterwards. It's one of the most
beautiful gifts in my life. Um,

486
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:03,750
so I know that meditation, um, but for
me, what timing is, if you want to be,

487
00:27:03,751 --> 00:27:07,620
have a prime life, you've got to be
in a prime state and uh, you know,

488
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:10,620
weeds grow automatically. I don't give
a damn what it is. And my teacher,

489
00:27:10,621 --> 00:27:13,110
Jim Rone used to say that.
And so when I do is I get up and I do it.

490
00:27:13,111 --> 00:27:15,900
Very simple process.
I do an explosive change in my physiology.

491
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:17,880
I've done the water
already, right? Cold, hot.

492
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,940
Then I do it with breath because I know,
you know,

493
00:27:20,941 --> 00:27:25,560
all forms of eastern meditation all
understand that the mind is the kite and

494
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:28,740
breath is the string. So if I want to
move that kite, I moved the breath.

495
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:33,100
So I have a specific pattern of breathing
that I do. I do 30 of these breaths, um,

496
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,190
and I do them at three sets of 30,

497
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,640
and that creates a profound
physiological difference in my body.

498
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:43,290
And from that altered state,
I usually listen to some music and um,

499
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:44,670
and I go for,

500
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:49,700
I promise myself 10 minutes and I
usually go 30 and I know I do it.

501
00:27:49,861 --> 00:27:52,260
All of this one room is where I do it.
This has got a great vibe.

502
00:27:52,261 --> 00:27:53,400
I'll do this one,
I do it at night.

503
00:27:53,401 --> 00:27:57,240
I usually will go outside cause I love
the wind on my face and I love taking the

504
00:27:57,241 --> 00:28:00,210
elements and so forth. But I do it
multiple places. I'm on the road, I do,

505
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:04,440
it doesn't matter what day. I always, I do
not miss priming. The reason is I'm not,

506
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,570
you don't get fit by getting lucky.

507
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,750
You don't get fit by working
out for a weekend. You know,

508
00:28:09,751 --> 00:28:10,740
you live your life that way.

509
00:28:10,741 --> 00:28:13,260
Fitness is cause it's becomes
just part of who you are.

510
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:14,490
So what I do during that time,

511
00:28:14,491 --> 00:28:17,010
because I do three simple things
and I do it minimum 10 minutes,

512
00:28:17,011 --> 00:28:21,720
three minutes of it is just me feeling
getting back inside my body and outside

513
00:28:21,721 --> 00:28:23,280
of my head feeling the earth,

514
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:26,550
my body and experience and then feeling
totally grateful for three things.

515
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:30,930
And I make sure one of them is something
very, very simple. The witness, my face,

516
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:33,360
you know, the reflection, the
clouds that I just saw there.

517
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:38,010
But I don't just think gratitude,
like I let gratitude fill my soul. Um,

518
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,620
because when you're grateful, as
we all know, there's no anger.

519
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:43,680
It's possibly angry and grateful
simultaneously when you're,

520
00:28:43,681 --> 00:28:45,330
when you're grateful,
there is no fear.

521
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:49,020
You can't be fearful and grateful
simultaneously. So it's, it's a,

522
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,690
I think it is one of the most
important power emotions of life.

523
00:28:51,691 --> 00:28:55,620
And also up to me, there's nothing
worse than an angry rich man or woman.

524
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,570
You know, somebody has got
everything and they're pissed off.

525
00:28:57,571 --> 00:29:00,450
I want to try some really high number
then. Yeah, it is because they,

526
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:04,230
they develop a life that's
based on expectation instead
of appreciation, degrade.

527
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,210
And I tell people,
you want to change your life.

528
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:09,000
Fascinating trade your expectation for
appreciation that you could have a whole

529
00:29:09,001 --> 00:29:13,680
new life. So everyday I anchored that in
and I do it very deeply and emotionally.

530
00:29:13,681 --> 00:29:18,681
Then the second three minutes I do is
a total focus on feeling a presence of

531
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:22,380
God, if you will, and will however you
want, a language that for yourself.

532
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:26,440
But this inner presence coming in and
feeling that heals everything in my body

533
00:29:26,441 --> 00:29:29,370
and my mind, my emotions, my
relationships, and my finances.

534
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:32,010
I see it as solving anything
that needs to be solved.

535
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:36,600
I experienced the strengthening of my
gratitude, of my joy, of my strength,

536
00:29:36,601 --> 00:29:38,310
of my conviction and my passion.

537
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:40,170
And I just let those things
happen spontaneously.

538
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:44,050
And then I on celebration
and then service, cause my
whole life is about service.

539
00:29:44,051 --> 00:29:45,010
That's it makes me feel alive.

540
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:49,330
So I flood myself with that
with a breathing pattern
that I take that does the

541
00:29:49,331 --> 00:29:52,480
opposite. It takes the breath down
through my body and back up again.

542
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:56,650
And then the last three minutes are me
focusing on three things I'm going to

543
00:29:56,651 --> 00:29:58,790
make happen.
My three to thrive and I,

544
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,630
I have some big things that I'll do
and sometimes I'll do things that are

545
00:30:01,631 --> 00:30:03,520
smaller, but I see them,
feel them, experience them.

546
00:30:03,521 --> 00:30:05,290
So it's a really simplistic
process is 10 minutes.

547
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:10,090
But I come out of it in my power and it
doesn't matter if I had two hours sleep,

548
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,490
I'm now ready. You know, it doesn't, and
I do this even when I have no sleep. I,

549
00:30:13,491 --> 00:30:15,880
that's how committed I am. Um, as I said,

550
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:19,930
I've always said there's no excuse not
to do 10 minutes if you don't have 10

551
00:30:19,931 --> 00:30:22,750
minutes, you don't have a wife. And
that's how I got myself to do it.

552
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,330
And now that I'd done it,
you know,

553
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:27,040
20 to 30 minutes is almost always
what it is because it actually feels

554
00:30:27,041 --> 00:30:27,874
extraordinary.

555
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:31,300
And where can people learn more about
the breathing pattern or can you describe

556
00:30:31,301 --> 00:30:31,690
it?

557
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:34,690
I'm putting a link online cause they
just started to share this just recently

558
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,090
and I'll get it for you. I don't know
what it was off the top of my head,

559
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,680
but it'll be up shortly,
I think this week.

560
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,850
Okay, awesome. And, uh, I will also
put that in the show notes guys.

561
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:45,100
So that's just for our
work week.com forward slash
podcast and you'll be able to

562
00:30:45,101 --> 00:30:48,520
find this episode. And,
uh, on the, I have to ask,

563
00:30:48,521 --> 00:30:50,530
what type of music do
you usually listen to?

564
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:54,110
I have a variety, but for that
meditation, I have one in particular,

565
00:30:54,111 --> 00:30:57,320
which is a oneness meditation that a
friend of mine made it foods from India

566
00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:01,670
that I find really profound as, um, no,
uh, singing in it and things like that.

567
00:31:01,671 --> 00:31:05,240
It's just the sound of a vibration
that's going on and I just love it.

568
00:31:05,241 --> 00:31:07,460
But that's what I'm doing currently.
In the past,

569
00:31:07,461 --> 00:31:09,440
over the years I've used all
kinds of different piece of music,

570
00:31:09,441 --> 00:31:12,650
but I don't use a modern music or pop
music or rock me. I just have to work out,

571
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:15,380
um, you know, rap. Um, I don't know,

572
00:31:15,381 --> 00:31:18,710
it just feels weird to be doing rap
while you're meditating. But again,

573
00:31:18,711 --> 00:31:22,010
what Steven is, I don't look as meditation
because I look at it as it's priming.

574
00:31:22,011 --> 00:31:26,010
Courage, love, joy. It's priming
gratitude. It's priming strength.

575
00:31:26,011 --> 00:31:28,340
That's primary accomplishment.
It's priming. You know,

576
00:31:28,341 --> 00:31:29,570
when I'm doing my gratitude piece,

577
00:31:29,571 --> 00:31:31,490
I'm doing the circle of who's
closest to me and you know,

578
00:31:31,491 --> 00:31:32,291
circling that out there,

579
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:34,730
everybody I love and sending that
energy and healing out to them as well.

580
00:31:34,731 --> 00:31:38,360
So to me that's, if you want primetime
life, you got to prime daily.

581
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:41,170
Uh, well I liked it. I liked
the term priding awesome.

582
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:44,520
Cause I think that most
people who struggle with
meditation or even an attempt

583
00:31:44,521 --> 00:31:47,400
to, to use meditation are
utilizing it for that purpose.

584
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:49,640
They're doing it first in the
morning. And uh, you know,

585
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:51,360
when you said if you don't have
10 minutes, you don't have a life.

586
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:53,190
That reminded me of something
that Russell Simmons said to me,

587
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:55,800
which was if you don't have 30 minutes
to meditate, you need three hours.

588
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:59,010
And I don't always do 30 minutes,

589
00:31:59,011 --> 00:32:02,130
but I do meditate in the morning and
it's been a can very consistent pattern

590
00:32:02,131 --> 00:32:05,190
through, uh, among all of the people that
I've interviewed so far on the podcast,

591
00:32:05,191 --> 00:32:09,540
really practically 100%. Wow.
That's, uh, and of course, uh, we'll,

592
00:32:09,541 --> 00:32:12,790
we'll get to Ray Daleo,
but also very avid meditator.

593
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:16,190
If he's coming with me to India and a
couple of weeks, that'll be an amazing,

594
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:17,710
I'm for a week of this experience.

595
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:20,080
Oh, amazing. Uh, the,

596
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,590
when people hear the name Tony Robbins,

597
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:28,090
I think many different people have
different assumptions. Were images, uh,

598
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,170
in their,
in their heads.

599
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:33,070
What are the biggest misconceptions or
the biggest misconception about you?

600
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:37,160
Oh my God. Many, right to, you know,

601
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:41,390
when you've been in the culture at
any level, for any period of time,

602
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:44,660
people put their projections out to
what you are. And then also, you know,

603
00:32:44,661 --> 00:32:48,230
I didn't help myself. I did
infomercials at a time, but you know,

604
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:49,970
I didn't want to do infomercials.
There's just,

605
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,870
I had these insights and
skillsets and I didn't have it.

606
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:58,130
If I was a great singer, which I'm clearly
not, there was a distribution channel,

607
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,350
right? I could do that. And if
I wasn't bullshitting myself,

608
00:33:00,351 --> 00:33:03,410
I could rock the world.
But in my world it was write a book,

609
00:33:03,411 --> 00:33:06,140
which most people don't read.
Um, go do some speeches.

610
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:08,750
So I looked around some of these
silly ass infomercials and I said,

611
00:33:08,751 --> 00:33:10,430
these guys are a disaster.
Tommy.

612
00:33:10,431 --> 00:33:13,820
Lou come be on my boat and watch me get
these women and I'm rich. And I'm like,

613
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:15,680
oh my God, it's disgusting.
I thought, you know,

614
00:33:15,681 --> 00:33:19,520
if you really did something that was
real and the kind of people I reach,

615
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:22,790
you know, I don't have to pay for
endorsements, they'll do it. You know,

616
00:33:22,791 --> 00:33:25,550
maybe people start to understand this as
real and maybe to help me reach people.

617
00:33:25,551 --> 00:33:28,420
And it did. It got me to Bill Clinton
and got me Princess Diana got me, I,

618
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:30,380
he got me a pretty amazing
group of people that stage.

619
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:32,930
But also you're known by
the company who keeps,

620
00:33:32,931 --> 00:33:36,740
so when you're between spray on hair
and you know, whatever, attention cake,

621
00:33:36,741 --> 00:33:41,150
diamonds, you know, then you, you know,
you're seen as that. And also I talk fast.

622
00:33:41,151 --> 00:33:44,360
I'm a passionate son of a bitch
and so I'm not talking fast.

623
00:33:44,361 --> 00:33:44,991
So what I'm trying to sell,

624
00:33:44,991 --> 00:33:47,390
so I'm talking fast because my
brain functions that speed, right?

625
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:50,580
That's how my brain goes, slowing it
down. It's just so boring to me. I pray.

626
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,360
The faster I go,
the stronger my brain becomes,

627
00:33:53,361 --> 00:33:56,590
the quicker I can come to solutions.
So, you know, when I'm most excited,

628
00:33:56,591 --> 00:33:58,070
I want to serve people.
It speeds up.

629
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:01,160
So that helps when you've got a room
of people where you can move the,

630
00:34:01,161 --> 00:34:02,330
modulate that energy.

631
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:05,300
But when you're seeing somebody on TV
and they look like a crazy son of a bitch

632
00:34:05,301 --> 00:34:08,000
and there's six, seven and they got
hands bigger than your head, you know,

633
00:34:08,001 --> 00:34:09,530
you start going, you
know, who is this guy?

634
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:13,850
The people that have actually like
yourself where Marc Benioff for President

635
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:17,870
Clinton or whoever who uh, you
know, actually entered into my work.

636
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:20,390
Once they enter the my work, they go,
oh my God, this is very different.

637
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:24,350
So I think most people think
I'm an infomercial guy or
a salesman or a motivator.

638
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:28,590
I mean I hate the word motivated
is the bane of my existence. Um,

639
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:29,900
cause I've never been that.
I've never,

640
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:32,630
I don't believe she could just go pump
yourself up. I believe in intelligence.

641
00:34:32,631 --> 00:34:37,150
I believe see things as they are. If you
can see George, you can't lead, right?

642
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:40,040
But don't see it worse than it is.
You've got an excuse not to try.

643
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,001
And that's what most people do.

644
00:34:41,001 --> 00:34:43,020
They make it much worse than it is
because they're afraid of failing.

645
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:45,320
So they come up with a reason
why, a story, why it's not there.

646
00:34:45,321 --> 00:34:48,680
And I don't tolerate that shit. I'm
not the guy that says there's no weeds.

647
00:34:48,681 --> 00:34:49,820
There's no weeds there, isn't
it? I mean the got to go,

648
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:50,970
let me show what the Goddamn weeds are.

649
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:53,660
Let's police set of the bitches out right
now and stop bullshitting. Let's do it.

650
00:34:53,661 --> 00:34:55,880
You're not, I'll do it with
you. That's my approach.

651
00:34:55,881 --> 00:34:59,270
I think most people think it's a pump
up approach because you know the media

652
00:34:59,271 --> 00:35:03,290
sees 10,000 people in the room and
they're jumping up and down and you know,

653
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:06,320
what is this piece?
So that's because I believe that learning,

654
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:11,180
I believe what I do for people and its
essence when I do events as he cubed them

655
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:14,630
eat cube is I entertained them first
because people in our society want to be

656
00:35:14,631 --> 00:35:16,370
educated,
but they'd much rather be entertained.

657
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:20,900
So if I can rock you and get you to
have an experience where you feel fully

658
00:35:20,901 --> 00:35:24,650
alive then, and it didn't matter
who you are, you're, you know,

659
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:28,310
you're from any stage of life,
any socioeconomic background,

660
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:32,630
then I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm going to
be able to have your education go deeper.

661
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:35,090
And then, so that's the second part.
I'll give you the best education,

662
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:38,010
the best tools. And the third one is
I empower you. You're in this state.

663
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:40,440
I get you to do things
that you won't forget.

664
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:43,260
Two things that will be in your body,
do things that create momentum.

665
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:45,930
So I think the misconception,

666
00:35:45,931 --> 00:35:49,470
at least in my perception is they don't
realize I'm really a strategist. I mean,

667
00:35:49,471 --> 00:35:52,620
I consider you a strategist. I know
you're inspirational, everything else,

668
00:35:52,621 --> 00:35:55,650
but being inspiring as nice. Uh, you know,

669
00:35:55,651 --> 00:35:58,290
it's like motivation is nothing
wrong with it. It's like a warm bath.

670
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:02,460
You should take one. Are you stink, you
know? But, but, uh, but that's not enough.

671
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:04,650
It has never been what I've been about.
But you know,

672
00:36:04,651 --> 00:36:07,000
most people in our society
or our interesting day,

673
00:36:07,001 --> 00:36:10,170
it's like if you're looking to
improve yourself, people in our world,

674
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,140
I think that's natural. The average
person is like, what's wrong with you?

675
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:17,250
I remember I had the, I took a company
public when I was, what, 39 years old.

676
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:21,450
I had a really wonderful head, 400 million
bucks. I mean, it was extraordinary.

677
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:26,100
And the man who ran my company had been
the former CEO of CBS, brilliant guy,

678
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:29,370
brilliant guy, Peter
and Peter. At one point,

679
00:36:29,371 --> 00:36:30,840
while we're in the midst of this company,
he said,

680
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:34,410
I want to go to Harvard and I want to
take this extension course, you know,

681
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:35,940
very wealthy guy,

682
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:40,500
been head of the largest networks in the
world and now heading up my company and

683
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:43,350
I remember three or four people like,
wow, it's a matter. Why is he doing that?

684
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:47,790
He lost his edge. He's like,
versus life is growth baby.

685
00:36:47,791 --> 00:36:50,250
If you don't keep growing, you're
going to die. You know? But still,

686
00:36:50,251 --> 00:36:53,820
most people are afraid of the unknown.
They're afraid of, I'm not looking good,

687
00:36:53,821 --> 00:36:56,730
I'm afraid to fail.
And so that creates a challenge.

688
00:36:56,731 --> 00:37:01,200
But so I think the answer question is,
uh, they don't know that I'm a strategist.

689
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,480
They don't know how much I really care.

690
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:06,780
They have no clue the depth of what I
teach or the diversity of what I teach

691
00:37:06,781 --> 00:37:10,050
subject your body, your mind, your
emotions, relationships, finances, um,

692
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:13,500
they don't know the real impact or
they don't know who I really work with.

693
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:13,681
You know,

694
00:37:13,681 --> 00:37:17,820
the assumption is he's taking over a week
people's minds and pumping them up and

695
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:21,360
giving them all this falls upon
them. That's crazy shit. But,

696
00:37:21,361 --> 00:37:24,480
but I am not here to try to dispel that.
What I try to do is,

697
00:37:24,481 --> 00:37:27,660
the reason I'm still here is the more
people you've touched, the more he reach.

698
00:37:27,661 --> 00:37:28,494
I don't have to do that.

699
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:32,370
The people who have been to my events
are the greatest people to balance that

700
00:37:32,371 --> 00:37:35,340
out in social media. It's been
really wonderful because people say,

701
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:38,190
this is what this guy is and 12 other
people go, you've never had an experience.

702
00:37:38,191 --> 00:37:40,560
Let me tell you what this really is about.
And that's really been a wonderful

703
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:44,370
enhancement to my ability to
reach people as social media.

704
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:49,970
I just to reiterate something you said
that about inspiration being necessary

705
00:37:49,971 --> 00:37:50,840
but not sufficient.

706
00:37:50,841 --> 00:37:55,760
I think that like you having the label
sort of motivation or motivational

707
00:37:55,761 --> 00:38:00,210
speaker, uh, applied to what
I try to do is very, uh,

708
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:04,940
frustrating because one of the things
that differentiated you do, Oh yeah,

709
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,470
I didn't know that's just an easy
label to throw. Right. And I was like,

710
00:38:07,471 --> 00:38:09,320
what else would you, it's like,
well, I'm not going to read the book,

711
00:38:09,321 --> 00:38:13,670
so I might as well find a label that
I can understand. Uh, and you know,

712
00:38:13,671 --> 00:38:15,650
I was going to say at least
you get an infomercial,

713
00:38:15,651 --> 00:38:18,260
but at least you weren't selling the
four hour workweek on those infomercials.

714
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:22,730
You'd have twice the level of how that
you already get. But the, the, the, uh,

715
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:24,043
the,

716
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:29,110
the difference in your material because
I w I really wanted to better myself

717
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:33,590
when I was a hitting some very rough
spots in my first year out of school.

718
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:38,320
And the difference between say,
personal power and a lot of, uh,

719
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:41,410
your other material, including
the new book, uh, on,

720
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,160
on money and finance and investing,
which you guys at some point,

721
00:38:45,161 --> 00:38:47,530
I'll try to share some of it with you,
but I have,

722
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:51,730
I would say probably 20 to 30 printed
pages of notes in Evernote. Well,

723
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:56,530
just on a, just on a w I s I
still have about 50 pages left,

724
00:38:56,531 --> 00:38:58,000
but it's, it's a big
book. We'll get to that.

725
00:38:58,001 --> 00:39:01,690
I was like giving you a pat on the back.
It's like, oh, another 600 page book.

726
00:39:01,691 --> 00:39:04,970
I know how these go. Uh, uh,

727
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:11,130
you give very tactical next
steps at the proper time.

728
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:16,350
So you, you, you do sugarcoat
the medicine a bit by getting,

729
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:19,570
capturing people's attention and not to
make this Glen, Gary, Glen Ross, you know,

730
00:39:19,571 --> 00:39:21,580
Ai Da,
but you,

731
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:25,000
you have to have those elements in the
proper sequence so you can't elicit

732
00:39:25,001 --> 00:39:29,920
action from people. That's right. And,
uh, that's something that you've had huge,

733
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:33,880
uh, you, you've been very
influential on my teaching,

734
00:39:33,881 --> 00:39:37,640
which is how I would view
my writing because of, uh,

735
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:42,760
that model. And so if you look at say
the four hour workweek is one instance,

736
00:39:42,761 --> 00:39:45,640
the reason that I have these comfort
challenges at the end of each chapter is

737
00:39:45,641 --> 00:39:48,970
because I know I'm going to have big
asks later and I want to condition people

738
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:50,301
to take action.

739
00:39:50,301 --> 00:39:54,490
And I think that your materials at some
of the best in the world I've ever seen

740
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:55,450
in any capacity.

741
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,950
I want to say something.
What would you say?

742
00:39:56,951 --> 00:39:59,130
Cause it's really important that
you're one of the few people I've heard

743
00:39:59,131 --> 00:40:02,490
actually notice it. All right. And, and
I've noticed it in your work and I just,

744
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:04,860
I didn't know it was, it influenced by
me anyway. I'm complimented by that.

745
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:06,810
But I think you probably would have got
there on your own just by the nature of

746
00:40:06,811 --> 00:40:10,320
your thinking. The dog bit
Johnny, Johnny bit the dog.

747
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:15,120
Same exact words, different syntax.
Totally different experience.

748
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:18,930
Especially if you're Johnny and people
don't realize it sometimes when they

749
00:40:18,931 --> 00:40:20,970
think I'm 30 pounds overweight
and I'll never get this.

750
00:40:20,971 --> 00:40:24,690
I've tried everything or I have, you
know, I like, every relationship sucks.

751
00:40:24,691 --> 00:40:27,660
You know, how do I end up with men
or women like this or you know,

752
00:40:27,661 --> 00:40:29,940
this is my third business
and I'm still not there.

753
00:40:29,941 --> 00:40:33,210
And I'll say I was going to happen.
They don't realize that victory is near.

754
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:37,230
And the reason is it feels like a million
miles away and they're doing the right

755
00:40:37,231 --> 00:40:41,430
things, but at the wrong time or they're
doing the wrong things, you know,

756
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:43,710
they're doing the right things in the
wrong sequence. You know what I mean?

757
00:40:43,711 --> 00:40:46,530
It's so, there's timing is so
invaluable on some of that.

758
00:40:46,531 --> 00:40:48,780
You and I know we can't control
some of those freaking luck,

759
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,440
but the more you study,
uh, how things grow,

760
00:40:52,441 --> 00:40:57,420
whether it be organizations or human
beings or families or communities, uh,

761
00:40:57,610 --> 00:41:01,770
or the way in which people, you know,
study ontology or study of knowledge,

762
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:03,990
there's a sequence and it's like,

763
00:41:03,991 --> 00:41:05,940
if I know somebody's phone number
and I dialed the wrong order,

764
00:41:05,941 --> 00:41:09,290
I don't reach him, but I do that same
exact ingredients, the right over,

765
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:10,500
and that's what people need very often.

766
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:14,370
Often they just need a slight twist and
they don't know it and they give up.

767
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:18,240
And so my part of my passion is to
help people find that two millimeters,

768
00:41:18,241 --> 00:41:20,640
you know, that little tiny
shift that changes at all.

769
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:23,250
One of the people I have these people
that I've coached over the years that are

770
00:41:23,251 --> 00:41:25,610
the best in the world, that
what they do. And, and I,

771
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:27,840
I'll take on clients who
I think by touching them,

772
00:41:27,841 --> 00:41:29,010
I can touching mass number of people.

773
00:41:29,011 --> 00:41:32,070
That's how I start with Paul
Tutor at 21 years ago. And um,

774
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,150
as turned out really well, this Robin
Hood group growing huge, giving way,

775
00:41:35,151 --> 00:41:38,450
1,000,000,002 weeks this time
and the impact that it's had.

776
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:41,210
But one of these people was
one of the top to give an idea,

777
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:44,090
facial surgeons in the world.
And uh,

778
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:48,160
I remember I went to go see him one
day for one of our sessions and uh, um,

779
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:50,750
he was late and I'm waiting
and then no problem. I'm busy.

780
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:55,100
And the nurse says he's going
to be a while. She says,
he said, doctor often said,

781
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:59,690
why don't you come in and watch?
And I said, wow, love that.

782
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,250
So you know, I get all scrubbed
up, the whole thing. Come in,

783
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,860
he's got rock and roll music in there.

784
00:42:03,861 --> 00:42:08,660
And this guy is like an artist and a
scientist mixed together in the most

785
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:12,680
powerful blend with a giant heart. And I
go in there, the music's Blair and he's,

786
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:15,620
Hey Tony, how are you doing? He
goes, watch this. He cuts a lives,

787
00:42:15,621 --> 00:42:16,790
this woman's face off.

788
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,750
And I felt a little speed change
and it was like, uh, you know,

789
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,570
I stayed around for a few
minutes just so you know,

790
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:28,160
to put up that I can handle this shit.
And I said, you know, I got a few calls,

791
00:42:28,161 --> 00:42:33,050
I got a bank, got the hell out
of there. So I go into his,

792
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:34,790
off he goes, just use
my office, make a call.

793
00:42:34,791 --> 00:42:39,230
So I'm recovering in his office and
getting to know I'm not a squeamish guy,

794
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:40,850
but that was, I just
wasn't prepared. Right.

795
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:45,660
So I'm sitting in his office
and he's entered a stage of
life where, you know, he,

796
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,910
this is a guy that sold to new,

797
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:51,290
I paid $2 million to fly him over
like 15 years ago, 20 years ago,

798
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:53,180
to do two of his family's faces.

799
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:55,550
This is a guy that anybody in
Hollywood who had the money,

800
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:59,420
he in those days there was nobody but
him the best on earth because he'd

801
00:42:59,421 --> 00:43:03,710
mathematically figured out how to trigger
beauty by what you and I would call

802
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:06,890
out. He's like, I charge shorthand
for you, an NLP term, right?

803
00:43:06,891 --> 00:43:10,430
Those little triggers in the visual
triggering device that affect kinesthetic

804
00:43:10,431 --> 00:43:12,290
change in human being.
And um,

805
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:14,750
and so I'm sitting in his desk
and he's got this manuscript.

806
00:43:14,751 --> 00:43:17,990
So I'm curious as the man she be working
on and he wants to finally teach other

807
00:43:17,991 --> 00:43:20,180
surgeons because he's old.
He doesn't want to just himself anymore.

808
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,100
He wants his material not to die.

809
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:25,760
And he's got a hundred and
maybe 150 pictures in the
most beautiful woman in the

810
00:43:25,761 --> 00:43:30,140
world the last 20 years across culturally
around the world. Stars, movie stars,

811
00:43:30,141 --> 00:43:30,974
different countries.

812
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:34,790
They've got the same thing for men and
he's got these drawings and he showed

813
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:36,500
that ironic.

814
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,750
He goes through and he shows that he
makes no more than seven changes ever and

815
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,800
the biggest change,
he makes us two millimeters.

816
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:47,390
And yet I saw an 84 year old woman
looked like she was an early fifties and

817
00:43:47,391 --> 00:43:50,600
gorgeous. And that's all the changes
that you made on her. I'm telling you,

818
00:43:50,601 --> 00:43:52,520
it's mind boggling. I, for example,

819
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:56,610
he knows that the measurement
of the pupil of a woman's eyes,

820
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:00,080
you measured that size and you measure
the distance below your nose to the top

821
00:44:00,081 --> 00:44:00,740
of a woman's life.

822
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:05,220
It's only for a woman if that measurement
is smaller than the people there.

823
00:44:05,221 --> 00:44:06,170
I had men,

824
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:09,620
when they look at someone's face are
driven and sexually attracted to her.

825
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:12,080
If it's a same size of pupil,
there's attraction.

826
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:14,600
If it's just two millimeters more,
she has an average face.

827
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,860
If it's more than two millimeters more,
her face is what he calls, but ass ugly.

828
00:44:18,861 --> 00:44:20,630
That was a technical term
you used at that point.

829
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:24,110
But so when I taught women this,
they start measuring their eye.

830
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:27,920
So he makes this little change and it
creates that puckered feeling that men

831
00:44:27,921 --> 00:44:29,660
don't even know why it's instinctive.

832
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:33,860
It's just a triggering device
that's instinctual than
me. So he knows the seven,

833
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:35,220
he knows the two millimeters.
And I was like,

834
00:44:35,221 --> 00:44:38,610
you take somebody 84 50 and
looking pretty damn hot. You know,

835
00:44:38,611 --> 00:44:41,070
maybe not to a 20 year old but
at 30 or 40 or 50 year old.

836
00:44:41,071 --> 00:44:44,340
Certainly it's mind boggling. So I've
always learned it. It's like golf, right?

837
00:44:44,341 --> 00:44:46,560
You know, two millimeters,
different stream, you know,

838
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:50,670
shanking way over here or putting it on
the green. So that's the whole thing.

839
00:44:50,671 --> 00:44:51,840
Victory is near,

840
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:56,490
but it got to know that very often
syntax is all that has to change.

841
00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:59,010
There's nothing wrong with you, there's
nothing wrong with the core ingredients.

842
00:44:59,450 --> 00:45:03,200
Got a sequence it differently. Yeah. So
you mentioned a few things. The first,

843
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:07,040
is that a hand bigger than
someone's head or face?

844
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:09,190
I think that for everyone listening,
uh,

845
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,900
at some point I would like to see if you
can actually pull my face and I'll put

846
00:45:11,901 --> 00:45:15,770
that out on social media because I'm
pretty sure that you can and I'm sure

847
00:45:15,771 --> 00:45:17,510
everybody would love to see they all,

848
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:19,700
they're probably a lot of people listening
who don't like me very much and would

849
00:45:19,701 --> 00:45:23,840
like to pull my face. So Tony will
step in for you later. Uh, the,

850
00:45:24,650 --> 00:45:29,060
I'd love for you to mention a little bit
about the new book and just sort of a

851
00:45:29,061 --> 00:45:32,750
very basic overview and then I have a
bunch of specific questions because this

852
00:45:32,751 --> 00:45:35,960
is the first book in 20
years, 20 years, 20 years,

853
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:39,290
and I've read pretty much everything that
you've put out that I'm aware of. Yes.

854
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,980
And I guess, pardon me? Pardon
me? Thought a few things.

855
00:45:42,981 --> 00:45:46,700
When I saw that this book
was related to two money, uh,

856
00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:51,500
and also referring to it as a game
in some ways. I thought, number one,

857
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:54,860
what hasn't already been said.
There's so many books,

858
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:59,470
there's so many books on
money. And I think that, uh,

859
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:04,600
perhaps undeservedly so I feel like
I understand a lot as it relates to

860
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:09,400
investing and money. And I've
read David Swensen, I've, I've,

861
00:46:09,410 --> 00:46:12,800
I've read about his allocations. I've
read the annual letters of Warren Buffett.

862
00:46:12,801 --> 00:46:17,780
I read the letters to shareholders from
people like Howard marks or other hedge

863
00:46:17,781 --> 00:46:19,460
fund managers.
I know some of those guys.

864
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,480
I saw a couple of names pop
up that I recognize. And uh,

865
00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:27,340
I was, and you said in the very
beginning of the book, and this is a tea,

866
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:31,010
I've tried to do stuff like this in
the past. I realize how hard it is.

867
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:35,600
You try to write a book that the,
the neophyte,

868
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:37,670
someone who's never taken
their finances seriously,

869
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:39,530
we'll derive a lot of value from.

870
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:43,220
And yet at the same time you say even
very sophisticated investors want to be

871
00:46:43,221 --> 00:46:46,220
able to get a lot out of this book.
And I thought to myself, oh boy,

872
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:51,170
this is really talking a
big game. And, uh, the,

873
00:46:51,171 --> 00:46:51,441
I mean,

874
00:46:51,441 --> 00:46:56,441
the interviews at the end of the book
alone are worth magnitudes of order more

875
00:46:56,571 --> 00:47:01,330
than the book itself. And
you've got Google, you've
got ray Dalio who runs the a,

876
00:47:01,331 --> 00:47:02,960
the,
I believe it's still largest,

877
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:08,440
largest mutual fund, the bowl, the
largest hedge fund with, uh, Carl Icahn,

878
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:11,500
who's Time magazine, put them on
the covers, master of the universe.

879
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:15,550
It's guy that sends out one tweet and
apple goes up 17 billion and in an hour,

880
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:18,610
right? That's up 50%. I was out and
he was not doing it again today.

881
00:47:18,611 --> 00:47:22,490
I don't know if you saw Carlos
quite a character. Um, yeah, no,

882
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:27,280
the two things. One coming, what you
said. Um, uh, that's the challenge.

883
00:47:27,281 --> 00:47:29,170
I love when I do my
business mastery programs,

884
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:33,970
I bring people in from usually
somewhere between 15 and 30 countries.

885
00:47:33,971 --> 00:47:37,660
I translate four or five languages.
They're different financial systems,

886
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:42,550
but business, the psychology
and the strategies of business,

887
00:47:42,850 --> 00:47:46,960
it's a worldwide game. And um, and so I
bring people in there that are brand new.

888
00:47:46,961 --> 00:47:49,660
They come in like just starting a business
and you've got people in there like

889
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:52,750
Homax largest home builder in Mexico
is one of my events, you know,

890
00:47:52,751 --> 00:47:54,210
a billion dollar business and I,

891
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:57,580
they credit me with $750 million
in increased in two years.

892
00:47:57,580 --> 00:48:01,420
I was doubling the business and I take
this chiropractor or this dentists,

893
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:01,751
you know,

894
00:48:01,751 --> 00:48:04,540
an army of three and so I'm going to
double your business in six months.

895
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:09,630
So I love that challenge of how do you
hit both and it's not easy to do that

896
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:13,430
far. I think we pulled it off, pulled
it off primarily because of who I,

897
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:14,710
it's not me doing the teaching,

898
00:48:14,711 --> 00:48:17,480
it's me going to the best on earth
and getting them some sheets.

899
00:48:17,490 --> 00:48:19,960
Your homie the same thing.
Um, you know, people say,

900
00:48:19,961 --> 00:48:22,160
why don't you write a book in 20 years?
But how you've been doing well,

901
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:23,920
about every four days I'm on an airplane.

902
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:26,680
I see a quarter of a million
people a year in 15 countries.

903
00:48:26,681 --> 00:48:30,760
That's what that I'm doing. And I, and
I love, I live for that environment,

904
00:48:30,761 --> 00:48:33,730
the rawness, the alive, every
moment. Something that stage,

905
00:48:33,731 --> 00:48:34,750
you never know who's going to stand up.

906
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:37,150
You don't know what the challenge is
going to be. I mean, that feels alive.

907
00:48:37,151 --> 00:48:41,230
And also it's just real and it's now,
and if it's not working for can change it.

908
00:48:41,231 --> 00:48:46,150
Who cares when I go to write, cause I
did 20 years ago, I'm sitting still.

909
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:49,880
I mean that first alone makes me crazy.
And then number two, uh, you know,

910
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:52,810
you took my, my hands, my music,
my voice, my face, my intensity.

911
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:56,440
And now I just got written words,
which I clearly amount of skilled that.

912
00:48:56,740 --> 00:49:00,010
But when I concentrated on I am,
but I also go, this is a mortal,

913
00:49:00,011 --> 00:49:02,680
I can't improve this. You know, it's
like once you write the shit, it's done.

914
00:49:02,681 --> 00:49:05,740
So I've avoided it like the plague. And
then also most people don't read, frankly.

915
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:08,200
It's, and how they read blogs,
you know, it's like most people,

916
00:49:08,201 --> 00:49:11,620
I can see a generation looking at this
book at 600 and what, 30 pages, right?

917
00:49:11,890 --> 00:49:14,770
But it's these seven steps that you
can do a chapter a day and then 30 days

918
00:49:14,771 --> 00:49:17,230
you've got a different financial
life. That's crazy. Like me.

919
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:20,290
You'll do it in a weekend, you know?
But what's interesting is they'll say,

920
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:22,210
you know, why don't you put
this in a blog? You know,

921
00:49:22,211 --> 00:49:25,840
why don't you put this infographic?
Mastery doesn't come from an infographic.

922
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:29,950
What you know, it doesn't mean
shit. What do you do consistently?

923
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:32,620
And you got to go through stages
of understanding intellectually,

924
00:49:32,621 --> 00:49:35,380
which anybody can do, but you got
to do and you've got to get words.

925
00:49:35,381 --> 00:49:36,850
There's enough emotional intensity,

926
00:49:36,851 --> 00:49:39,130
attach that understanding
that you actually do it.

927
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:41,380
And then you've got to get
enough consisting of boat
goes and it gets in your

928
00:49:41,381 --> 00:49:43,450
body and art to feed about,
and it becomes who you are.

929
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:48,490
And those stages of mastery require.
It's like I, I took taekwondo,

930
00:49:48,491 --> 00:49:49,420
I didn't want taekwondo.

931
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:51,940
I wanted to learn a key though
was that it was a beautiful art.

932
00:49:52,330 --> 00:49:54,250
And I like the idea.
They don't have to hurt somebody.

933
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:57,220
10 people attack you at once. Then
it's like wonderful. You know?

934
00:49:57,490 --> 00:49:58,450
So I learned some mosquito,

935
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:03,370
but I had the privilege of being exposed
to grandmaster June Rhee who brought

936
00:50:03,371 --> 00:50:04,510
taekwondo to this country.

937
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:08,800
And he trained Muhammad Ali and he trained
Bruce Lee and as acupuncture and so

938
00:50:08,801 --> 00:50:12,310
forth.
Amazing history and a beautiful man,

939
00:50:12,311 --> 00:50:14,380
like the most happy human
being you ever meet.

940
00:50:14,381 --> 00:50:17,080
And He loved me and what I did
was touched by it and he said,

941
00:50:17,081 --> 00:50:20,500
would you like to do this?
And I was 2124 so I said, yes,

942
00:50:20,501 --> 00:50:23,800
but I must get my black belt the fastest
time in human history and you must come

943
00:50:23,801 --> 00:50:27,610
travel with me. We will do this every
day. I don't like you're insane. Yeah.

944
00:50:27,710 --> 00:50:32,420
I read your book in two days. It was
like completely say, so he came in,

945
00:50:32,421 --> 00:50:35,920
I finished being off stage at midnight
or 1:00 AM and then I got up to go train

946
00:50:35,930 --> 00:50:39,620
from one to four and then I'd sleep
from four to seven 33 and a half hours,

947
00:50:39,621 --> 00:50:42,860
four hours, sometimes eight. If I could
squeeze it, get up and do my next day.

948
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,990
I did that for nine months.

949
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:48,020
I did get a black belt legitimately
in the shortest time history,

950
00:50:48,021 --> 00:50:49,460
but I hate it and never
want to do it again.

951
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:54,080
But I'll never forget I was doing these
moves and it's like she is four in the

952
00:50:54,081 --> 00:50:56,240
morning.
I'm doing the same fricking move.

953
00:50:56,241 --> 00:50:59,720
And I bent over and over and over
again, and I said, mystery. I said,

954
00:50:59,721 --> 00:51:02,870
can we go to the next move? And he said,
grasshopper, this is the next move.

955
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:04,700
And he started to laugh.
He goes,

956
00:51:04,701 --> 00:51:08,000
the fact that you think this and this is
the same move is why we're still doing

957
00:51:08,001 --> 00:51:12,200
it. I like it, but you know
what? It was really true.

958
00:51:12,201 --> 00:51:13,910
So I'm into mastery.
And so what I,

959
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,450
I really wanted to make sure happen
with people is that we got them to that

960
00:51:17,451 --> 00:51:21,110
place. And, uh, when I went to
Simon, Schuster is a crazy thing.

961
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,490
So I'm doing these events,
I'm loving this.

962
00:51:22,491 --> 00:51:25,550
I'm sure she's been begging me for a
book for decades, a huge contracting.

963
00:51:25,551 --> 00:51:27,140
They bigger and bigger. And I
said, I don't need the money.

964
00:51:27,141 --> 00:51:29,800
I'm not doing it for the money.
So they finally came back and I,

965
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:34,580
what triggered me is I saw this
documentary called inside job

966
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,750
and that team and did the audio on
it and it went all kinds of awards.

967
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:41,210
But what's happened if you didn't see it,
I really recommend you see it,

968
00:51:41,211 --> 00:51:43,400
but I do want to prepare you at the end.

969
00:51:43,401 --> 00:51:46,880
You're either extremely pissed off or
you're really depressed depending upon

970
00:51:46,881 --> 00:51:47,420
your personality.

971
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:51,830
And I was pissed off because they show
how a small number of people basically

972
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,740
put the entire economic world at risk.

973
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:57,590
And when they put us near imploding,

974
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:02,420
the punishment for that was to reward
them by putting them in charge of the

975
00:52:02,421 --> 00:52:04,190
recovery,
printing more money,

976
00:52:04,191 --> 00:52:07,020
and then taxing everybody else in
earth and giving their money back.

977
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,090
It's just my,
it's the,

978
00:52:08,091 --> 00:52:11,030
it's the greatest Steve re
that's happened in human history.

979
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:14,150
And so I thought this is making
the anchors, there's no solution.

980
00:52:14,570 --> 00:52:17,510
And I thought there's gotta be a solution.
I thought, you know what, I got access.

981
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:19,510
The one thing I'm going to
access, cause I called, you know,

982
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,210
coach Paul for 21 years.
And I mean,

983
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:24,430
he's never lost money in
21 years in mind boggling.

984
00:52:24,431 --> 00:52:26,000
His companies never lost in 28 years.

985
00:52:26,001 --> 00:52:27,830
I was brought in when he's
having a tough time, tell,

986
00:52:28,010 --> 00:52:32,120
take things to the next level. And
um, I thought, I know these people.

987
00:52:32,121 --> 00:52:33,170
I know this process.

988
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:36,020
What if I took with the ultra
wealthy not what and brought it in.

989
00:52:36,021 --> 00:52:37,260
So I think I got this great strategy.

990
00:52:37,261 --> 00:52:39,600
You go to Simon Schuster is wanting to
book forever. And the first thing he says,

991
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,870
no. I said, what do you
can't tell me? No. He goes,

992
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:45,440
Tony Know Jonathan's brilliant
management. The carpet. It's Tony,

993
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:47,120
you don't want to do this.
He goes,

994
00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:51,050
people are dying for a book on peak
performance for you dying for a buck on

995
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:55,400
anything but not finding
this. This category is a
dead carcass is what he said.

996
00:52:55,401 --> 00:52:57,710
It's been picked clean. Same things
you're saying right to ironically.

997
00:52:57,860 --> 00:53:00,890
So did the head of the financial division.
He goes, there's nothing new to say.

998
00:53:00,891 --> 00:53:02,460
I said, that's good.
Everybody's attacking.

999
00:53:02,490 --> 00:53:04,420
And same way I'm going to go to
the people that know nothing,

1000
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:06,050
platitudes at the same bs.

1001
00:53:06,410 --> 00:53:09,920
He actually offered me a larger advance
to not do a financial book and I said,

1002
00:53:09,921 --> 00:53:12,230
look, I'm not doing it for
that. I'm in for this book,

1003
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:15,470
and so now he's really thrilled,
which was really wonderful. In fact,

1004
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:17,540
the head of that division
came back and said, he said,

1005
00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:19,910
I really thought the categories dad
and I had the division. He goes,

1006
00:53:19,911 --> 00:53:21,620
this is alive,
so I'm real proud of it,

1007
00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:26,220
but I think what's great about the book
is there's not a word in there that's

1008
00:53:26,221 --> 00:53:29,280
coming from me on the financial side.
I don't tell you my opinion.

1009
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:32,160
Who gives a shit where my opinion is,
I want to write down his opinion,

1010
00:53:32,161 --> 00:53:34,240
his own checkbooks. Man. I want
to know a call I can spend.

1011
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:36,090
I want to know what
Mary Callahan Air Dose,

1012
00:53:36,091 --> 00:53:39,270
who's head of JP Morgan and manages
two point 3 trillion with a t.

1013
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:42,390
I want to know her opinion when it comes
to the emotional psychological side.

1014
00:53:42,450 --> 00:53:45,900
Yeah, that's been my baby for 36
years. Those bins are clearly mine.

1015
00:53:45,901 --> 00:53:46,734
I'll stand on them.

1016
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:50,610
So I'm real proud of what it
is and I think anybody who
reads it will be touched.

1017
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,640
And I wrote it to empower
readers of all types,

1018
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,680
but I also wrote it because I was looking,

1019
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:59,460
thinking about a vehicle for writing
another wrong, in my opinion.

1020
00:53:59,461 --> 00:54:02,700
I think the system is clearly,
you know guys, you know,

1021
00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:06,810
if you read flyboys or you talked to
Michael Lewis or anybody like him,

1022
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:10,710
they'll describe to you how high
frequency trading today is so extreme.

1023
00:54:10,711 --> 00:54:12,510
We've all heard about it,
but it's just so extreme.

1024
00:54:12,630 --> 00:54:16,740
It takes 500 milliseconds for you to
click on your, your EEG trade and say,

1025
00:54:16,741 --> 00:54:18,300
I want to buy the stock of Apple.

1026
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:23,500
And you got guys that have spent a
quarter of $1 billion to straighten wines,

1027
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:24,410
but you can Chicago,

1028
00:54:24,450 --> 00:54:29,450
New York so they can save 1.4 milliseconds
and they're going to trade hundreds,

1029
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:33,030
maybe thousands of times.
They know you're going after apple,

1030
00:54:33,031 --> 00:54:35,700
they know what to do and to make money
a little micro profits. One of the,

1031
00:54:35,701 --> 00:54:40,140
each of t groups was going to go public
last year. So I had to do their filings.

1032
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:45,800
You know how many losing days they had
in four years and do not one one losing

1033
00:54:47,761 --> 00:54:50,610
day in four years. It's front
running. So the system is rigged,

1034
00:54:50,611 --> 00:54:53,550
but even though it's rig, you can still
win. That's why I wrote this book.

1035
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:53,840
I want to,

1036
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:56,700
you can still win and here's how to win
and here's the people showing you how to

1037
00:54:56,701 --> 00:55:00,990
win. So I wanted to right that wrong.
I wanted people to have an advocate,

1038
00:55:00,991 --> 00:55:04,260
but I also am pretty passionate about
taking care of people in society is

1039
00:55:04,270 --> 00:55:07,900
forgotten. And I decided initially I
wanted to like raise my game. They,

1040
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:11,460
they cut eight point $7 billion
from food stamps last summer.

1041
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:13,200
Most people don't even notice it.

1042
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:15,750
If he couldn't have every
family who's being supported,

1043
00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:19,080
going without food for one week out
of the month for 12 straight months.

1044
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:21,060
And I had been supporting, I've, you know,

1045
00:55:21,090 --> 00:55:23,880
my family was fed when I was 11 years old.
I had no food,

1046
00:55:24,510 --> 00:55:27,030
family spanking by and
delivered a Turkey and food.

1047
00:55:27,031 --> 00:55:28,770
And it was just the delivery
guy changed my life.

1048
00:55:28,771 --> 00:55:31,050
It made me believe strangers care.
So I cared about strangers.

1049
00:55:31,051 --> 00:55:34,530
I've been paying it forward and I
fed 42 million people in 37 years.

1050
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:38,520
This year I'm going to feed 50
million people. And myself personally,

1051
00:55:38,521 --> 00:55:40,340
I'd started with, I'm gonna
advance the book. I'm going to,

1052
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:42,000
I'm going to wait and sell
books and see how it goes.

1053
00:55:42,001 --> 00:55:43,910
I'm just going to dance all of
that. I was like, oh, I want,

1054
00:55:43,930 --> 00:55:45,930
I don't want to do ten nine
one in 20 million, the 30.

1055
00:55:45,930 --> 00:55:48,780
So now I'm doing 50 million
and I'm getting matching funds.

1056
00:55:48,781 --> 00:55:51,780
I have feeding America, delivering the
food and I'm getting matching funds,

1057
00:55:51,781 --> 00:55:54,150
targeting 100 million
people this year alone.

1058
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:57,060
And then I'm putting a system
in place to sustain that.

1059
00:55:57,061 --> 00:56:00,630
So doing this book has been opening
up doors to thinking larger cause when

1060
00:56:00,631 --> 00:56:03,960
you're sitting with Carl Icahn and he
goes, yeah, I just closed the deal today.

1061
00:56:03,961 --> 00:56:05,190
I made $2 billion,

1062
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:09,090
2 billion the day I was there after
only 18 months of investment where he

1063
00:56:09,091 --> 00:56:12,240
putting on an event and I
forget the number you started
with a small number. Um,

1064
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:13,350
and Netflix,
Netflix,

1065
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:16,830
it made it that day and he's now putting
all this money in apple when he does,

1066
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:20,700
you know, does it little tweet and 17
billion of value goes up right away.

1067
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:26,080
Or you're sitting with Kyle Bass who
took 30 million attorney to 2,000,000,002

1068
00:56:26,081 --> 00:56:30,070
years in the middle of the
subprime con, you know, a crisis.

1069
00:56:30,850 --> 00:56:34,750
Tell me again, I was like holy cow. I
mean I started learning things, switch.

1070
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:36,520
It changes the scale of your thinking.

1071
00:56:36,521 --> 00:56:39,130
So I think I'm babbling here cause what
I want people to know is two things. Yes.

1072
00:56:39,490 --> 00:56:42,370
I think this truly, if you'll give
yourself the gift of this book,

1073
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:46,360
it's a category breaker but uh,
it'll show you step by step and I go,

1074
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:48,730
where are you, where you want to
be? If you're highly advanced,

1075
00:56:48,790 --> 00:56:51,910
you're going to learn out
of the 55 plus say 50,

1076
00:56:51,911 --> 00:56:54,460
but it's really 55 plus Nobel
laureate self made billionaires,

1077
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:55,840
hedge fund guys biggest in the world.

1078
00:56:55,841 --> 00:56:59,020
I put the 12 biggest in
the book and you know,

1079
00:56:59,021 --> 00:57:02,730
I went to these guys with up the promise
of a 45 minute interview and I haven't

1080
00:57:02,731 --> 00:57:06,370
told it was three hours. I know how you
function cause I do the same thing. Uh,

1081
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:07,450
but what was really cool,

1082
00:57:07,451 --> 00:57:10,240
but it's like you don't get with Carl
and I get down with Carl and the first

1083
00:57:10,241 --> 00:57:13,150
thing he does is he throws the video crew
out. It's like, Carl, what's the deal?

1084
00:57:13,151 --> 00:57:15,040
I've never met him before. He's
like, no, I thought very girl,

1085
00:57:15,050 --> 00:57:19,690
but I just changed my mind. I can, okay.
Uh, how the, well, we'll do the audio. No,

1086
00:57:19,691 --> 00:57:22,350
I don't want the audio. No audio.
How am I going to do this interview?

1087
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:24,760
Have to take your pencil and your
pen here, get over here. And he said,

1088
00:57:24,761 --> 00:57:28,720
I'll give you 10 minutes. And
you know, now Howard, your
friends and his, you know,

1089
00:57:28,721 --> 00:57:31,930
three hours later I'm out,
you know, pictures of he
and his wife then, you know,

1090
00:57:31,931 --> 00:57:32,920
and he said,
you got to really,

1091
00:57:32,921 --> 00:57:35,390
you've got to wait to help change
this world and you know, and,

1092
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:37,090
and he's doors of the
book and supports it.

1093
00:57:37,210 --> 00:57:41,800
So I want people to know that this has
been a four year journey of going to the

1094
00:57:41,801 --> 00:57:46,090
smartest people on earth and finding
out the vast majority of them are

1095
00:57:46,091 --> 00:57:49,450
incredibly genuine in wanting
the average person to do well.

1096
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:51,660
They just didn't think there was
anybody who could translate it.

1097
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:52,960
And when he saw that,
I could,

1098
00:57:52,961 --> 00:57:55,840
and I can pitch and catch with them
because I do 18 hours of prep before I sit

1099
00:57:55,841 --> 00:57:57,100
down with Ray Dalio.
Uh,

1100
00:57:57,260 --> 00:57:59,820
they will want to share things that
they've never shared before. And later on,

1101
00:57:59,830 --> 00:58:01,990
maybe we can talk about what I learned
from Ray. Dahlia was pretty amazing.

1102
00:58:02,070 --> 00:58:02,701
Oh yeah,
no,

1103
00:58:02,701 --> 00:58:07,380
I do want to talk about
ray and fascinating guy.

1104
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:10,380
I mean, I'm, I'm so fascinated with
the entire world. I mean, whether it's,

1105
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:12,870
and there's so many different breed and
so this is something that I want to talk

1106
00:58:12,871 --> 00:58:13,021
about,

1107
00:58:13,021 --> 00:58:17,070
but you have say the Paul Tudor Jones
for those who probably haven't ever seen

1108
00:58:17,071 --> 00:58:19,260
and very old film,
I think it's available,

1109
00:58:19,410 --> 00:58:24,410
like bootleg VHS called the trader
is an amazing old documentary.

1110
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:28,830
You can find it. Uh, but you can
see his style versus say, you know,

1111
00:58:28,831 --> 00:58:31,380
the high frequency guys or a renaissance.
Yes.

1112
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:36,270
All Phd is right outside of Wall
Street. And then, and then you have the,

1113
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:40,200
the, the, the Ray Dalio types and uh,

1114
00:58:40,530 --> 00:58:43,800
and all things in common. If you look,
so different strategies. If it's summer,

1115
00:58:43,801 --> 00:58:44,634
let's,
let's,

1116
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:48,420
let's shake the tree of the corporate
guys and make sure we get more value out

1117
00:58:48,421 --> 00:58:52,440
of it. Right. Carl, you know, and,
and some guys are like, Templeton,

1118
00:58:52,441 --> 00:58:56,610
I got to interview multiple times for
he died. It's like, wait for the blood.

1119
00:58:56,611 --> 00:58:59,280
Wedding, flooding the streets.
That's what you're on the streets.

1120
00:58:59,281 --> 00:59:02,520
But it's like when maximum pessimism hits,
that's when you make all your money.

1121
00:59:02,521 --> 00:59:05,550
That's what he did. And then
there's the guys like Bogle witches.

1122
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:09,950
It's the index baby. And these days, even
Warren Buffet, it's the index baby. Um,

1123
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:10,890
so the whole approaches,

1124
00:59:10,891 --> 00:59:15,270
but what's in common I think is I tell
you four things I saw and stood out and

1125
00:59:15,271 --> 00:59:16,590
one is overly simplistic.

1126
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:18,630
And that's why people don't pay
attention to it with these guys.

1127
00:59:18,631 --> 00:59:21,550
Pay attention to it.
They don't lose half.

1128
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:24,530
The Keke awakening is not
losing and they are obsessed.

1129
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:27,950
Every single one is obsessed
and not losing money. I mean,

1130
00:59:27,951 --> 00:59:31,880
a level of obsession that's mind boggling.
And it isn't just these investors.

1131
00:59:31,881 --> 00:59:34,070
You know, Richard Branson
for example, you know,

1132
00:59:34,490 --> 00:59:37,880
people see Richard and he's such
an outgoing, playful, crazy guides,

1133
00:59:37,881 --> 00:59:39,200
kind of little bird.
And that's some areas.

1134
00:59:39,201 --> 00:59:42,830
But when it comes to athletics and taking
on challenges, he's out in the world.

1135
00:59:43,610 --> 00:59:44,240
But you know,

1136
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:47,300
his first question every
business is what's the downside
and how you protect it,

1137
00:59:47,301 --> 00:59:50,870
right? Like when he did his piece
with virgin, I mean that's a big risk.

1138
00:59:50,871 --> 00:59:53,810
Going to start an airline.
He went to Boeing and negotiated a deal.

1139
00:59:53,811 --> 00:59:56,810
They could send the planes back and it
didn't work out and he wasn't liable.

1140
00:59:57,020 --> 00:59:58,520
That's the wobblies guys think out.

1141
00:59:58,610 --> 01:00:03,050
So they look to see how do I not lose
money first because the average person has

1142
01:00:03,051 --> 01:00:07,250
no clue if I lose 50%
in 2008 well guess what?

1143
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:11,540
You're going to make 100% to get even not
50% because your principal's gone down

1144
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:11,891
so much.

1145
01:00:11,891 --> 01:00:15,740
And it's like people don't understand
you lose 60% it's 200% to get even.

1146
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:18,420
And so the average person,
you know,

1147
01:00:18,510 --> 01:00:22,190
lives in a world where they try not to
lose money, but they're not obsessed.

1148
01:00:22,191 --> 01:00:23,870
He's got upset seconding.
They all have in common.

1149
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:28,010
Every single one of them is obsessed
with asymmetrical risk reward,

1150
01:00:28,011 --> 01:00:28,880
which is a big word.

1151
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:33,650
It simply means they're looking at you
the least amount of risk to get the

1152
01:00:33,651 --> 01:00:37,580
maximum amount of upside. And that's what
they live for. So I'll give an example.

1153
01:00:37,581 --> 01:00:40,130
Paul tutors,
when I first went to do the turnaround,

1154
01:00:40,131 --> 01:00:42,350
when Paul's having some challenging times,
we've broken his leg.

1155
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:43,333
You don't think about this,

1156
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:46,100
he did better than anybody in history
of the world during the biggest stock

1157
01:00:46,101 --> 01:00:49,940
market drop in history, literally.
And then he went to the mountain,

1158
01:00:49,941 --> 01:00:54,330
he went to the moon. Now what? And so
we lost a bit of the edge and you know,

1159
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:57,420
got involved in other things and so forth.
And now he's got a broken leg.

1160
01:00:57,421 --> 01:01:00,140
He's not going to the office. I got
to come inside and go watch that film.

1161
01:01:00,141 --> 01:01:02,630
That's the first thing I did.
I went white tennis shoes.

1162
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:05,660
I wanted to go see everything about him,
study his physiology,

1163
01:01:05,661 --> 01:01:07,520
the way he used to move,
cause this guy's not moving at all.

1164
01:01:07,521 --> 01:01:10,100
What his face was like, how
we breathe, tone of his voice.

1165
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:11,510
What were the physical strategies,

1166
01:01:11,511 --> 01:01:14,840
what were the psychological strategy or
the financial strategies. I got to go,

1167
01:01:14,870 --> 01:01:16,750
you know,
to Druckenmiller and sorrows.

1168
01:01:16,970 --> 01:01:18,980
The we're gonna access to
back then was unbelievable.

1169
01:01:19,130 --> 01:01:22,400
See what was he like then to put the
plan together to do this turnaround.

1170
01:01:22,730 --> 01:01:26,390
And when I started making those shifts
in him and you could see the shift

1171
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:28,640
happened immediately,
it got really exciting.

1172
01:01:28,641 --> 01:01:33,440
I got hooked on what was going to happen.
So as I and I did the same process,

1173
01:01:33,441 --> 01:01:35,570
basically that's what I've been triggered.
I'm think about doing things.

1174
01:01:35,571 --> 01:01:37,580
Once I did the same process
during these interviews,

1175
01:01:38,150 --> 01:01:40,820
I didn't just look at the trading
strategies. I looked at the psychology,

1176
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:41,673
what set it up,

1177
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:44,420
but here's what I found with Paul to the
very beginning and and background trap.

1178
01:01:45,050 --> 01:01:46,250
When he's done his best,

1179
01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:50,510
he made sure every single trade
had what he called a five to one.

1180
01:01:50,930 --> 01:01:52,640
That means if he was
going to risk a dollar,

1181
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:55,820
he wasn't about to risk unless he was
certain he was going to make five.

1182
01:01:56,210 --> 01:01:59,030
Now you're not always right,
so guess what?

1183
01:01:59,060 --> 01:02:01,100
If I risk a dollar to
make five and I'm wrong,

1184
01:02:01,310 --> 01:02:04,740
I can rescue another dog I still make for,
I can be wrong.

1185
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:07,220
Four times out of five
it's still breakeven.

1186
01:02:07,310 --> 01:02:10,130
Even their secret is not that they don't,
they're not wrong.

1187
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:14,030
If they set themself up where they
risk small amounts for big rewards

1188
01:02:14,031 --> 01:02:17,090
proportionally Po, you know he's
right, one out of three times,

1189
01:02:17,091 --> 01:02:21,450
he's still makes 20% so the average person
was a dollar trying to make how much

1190
01:02:21,990 --> 01:02:25,440
dollar? 10 Buck? 10 if
I could get 10% wow,

1191
01:02:25,441 --> 01:02:29,010
my dollar right of 20%
would be unbelievable. How
often could you be wrong?

1192
01:02:29,450 --> 01:02:33,000
Not very often. Not at all, right? You're
in the hole. You're starting from the,

1193
01:02:33,010 --> 01:02:36,090
and they got to build back up,
so they're a snicker where it's like,

1194
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:38,280
I was with Kyle Bass and Kyle Bass risked.

1195
01:02:38,340 --> 01:02:41,490
Check this out in the middle
of the subprime crisis,

1196
01:02:41,970 --> 01:02:45,810
he made $2 billion out of 30 million
because he risked for every sixth sense.

1197
01:02:45,811 --> 01:02:49,530
He risked. He had an upset of a
dollar 6 cents for a hundred well,

1198
01:02:49,531 --> 01:02:53,790
you give me wrong 15 times and you're
still okay in that area. I mean,

1199
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,940
he was brilliant to figure it
out. He's a genius. Figured out,

1200
01:02:56,941 --> 01:03:00,090
but that risk reward is why it is. He
showed his kids, he talked. I said,

1201
01:03:00,091 --> 01:03:03,300
how do I teach us the average
investors? And he said that, well,

1202
01:03:03,390 --> 01:03:05,550
you could teach the way I taught my kids.
And I said, how'd you do that? He goes,

1203
01:03:05,670 --> 01:03:09,840
we bought Nichols. I said, what do you
mean he bought Nichols? He said, well,

1204
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:12,840
I did research. I have this
question. That's another
thing that all these guys do.

1205
01:03:12,870 --> 01:03:15,960
They ask a better question and we talked
about they get better answers, right?

1206
01:03:16,170 --> 01:03:18,360
Then a quality question, better
quality answer. What's wrong with me?

1207
01:03:18,361 --> 01:03:20,640
You'll come up with stuff.
How do I make this happen no matter what,

1208
01:03:20,641 --> 01:03:24,630
they'll come up with different answers.
So his question was, we're in the world,

1209
01:03:24,631 --> 01:03:27,090
is there a riskless
trade with total upside?

1210
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:31,110
And he started looking around and he said,
I'm worried about inflation.

1211
01:03:31,111 --> 01:03:34,650
So he decided, well, Gosh, of all the
currencies in the world, uh, Nicole,

1212
01:03:34,651 --> 01:03:37,320
when it's made up today, it's not
made mostly of Nicole, by the way,

1213
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:42,680
he said it's costing the US government
nine and a half cents to make a nickel.

1214
01:03:42,930 --> 01:03:44,520
That's how our government functions.

1215
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:48,690
It has been almost 10 cents to make
something worth half as much, right?

1216
01:03:48,750 --> 01:03:52,530
Depending on plant. It's the perfect
point. So he said, but you know what,

1217
01:03:52,590 --> 01:03:57,180
just the actual material value,
right? It's 6.8 or whatever it was,

1218
01:03:57,181 --> 01:04:00,300
six something, six and a half a
cup for round numbers. So he said,

1219
01:04:00,450 --> 01:04:02,400
if I buy a nickel,
it's never going less than a nickel.

1220
01:04:02,410 --> 01:04:03,660
How she believed US government's gone.

1221
01:04:04,470 --> 01:04:06,360
So I've got something that
never goes down in value.

1222
01:04:06,361 --> 01:04:09,030
So I got a guaranteed return, you
know, I'm not gonna lose my principal,

1223
01:04:09,870 --> 01:04:12,960
but they won. It's worth 36%
more than the, of bought it.

1224
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:17,310
How many investments can you have? 100%
guarantee of no loss. And if 36% I said,

1225
01:04:17,311 --> 01:04:20,940
yeah, but that's smelt value. And I saw
they passed a law a few years ago. Uh,

1226
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:23,670
Charlie rangle over was the one that
pushed it through. And he goes, yeah,

1227
01:04:23,671 --> 01:04:27,240
but Tony said, that doesn't matter.
He's, let me tell you why. He said,

1228
01:04:27,241 --> 01:04:31,290
look at Penney's when they changed it
from pure copper to 10 and all things,

1229
01:04:31,291 --> 01:04:35,370
they changed. What happened to the old
pennies? There's a scarcity of them.

1230
01:04:35,550 --> 01:04:39,210
And now a penny from those days there
were two sets. It's 100% more valuable.

1231
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:42,400
So he said that at some
point the government cannot
continue to do something.

1232
01:04:42,401 --> 01:04:45,630
It costs twice as much. Some point
they'll make a change in the materials.

1233
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:48,480
And then all of these nickels worth
the unbelievable amounts. So he said,

1234
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:50,340
I just showed my kids,
here's a risk.

1235
01:04:50,380 --> 01:04:52,020
You need to look different
than everybody else.

1236
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:54,660
Don't think I have to take huge
risks for huge award thing.

1237
01:04:54,810 --> 01:04:56,760
How do I take no risk
and get huge rewards?

1238
01:04:57,030 --> 01:04:59,940
And because you asked that question
continuously and you believe in answer,

1239
01:04:59,941 --> 01:05:03,570
you get it. So you know I, he said,
listen, if I could put my introvert,

1240
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:06,910
my entire wealth and males right, that I
do, and I said, you're insane. It goes,

1241
01:05:06,911 --> 01:05:10,200
I am insane, but it's the best
possible fundamental investment.

1242
01:05:10,201 --> 01:05:14,190
He started telling me how to do it.
He bought 40 million Nichols. Wow.

1243
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:17,890
He has 40 million.
Nicole fills up a room bigger this right.

1244
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:19,090
That'd be on the ground floor.

1245
01:05:19,091 --> 01:05:22,120
And he got his kids dragging him
yet I was laughing and having fun.

1246
01:05:22,121 --> 01:05:23,460
If you have this like
their little treasure,

1247
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:27,760
he can legitimately do like the scrooge
McDuck backstroke pull full of nickels,

1248
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:32,630
nickels. So that's asymmetrical will give
you one more and I'll shut the hell up.

1249
01:05:34,010 --> 01:05:34,601
You're asking me that,

1250
01:05:34,601 --> 01:05:37,030
what you're told me the differences I
want you to know there are differences.

1251
01:05:37,031 --> 01:05:38,830
We can spend hours and
hours the differences,

1252
01:05:38,831 --> 01:05:40,810
but when it thinks
useful is what's a wine,

1253
01:05:40,811 --> 01:05:43,180
because then give something universal
that can be applied. Absolutely.

1254
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:47,860
The other one for them is they absolutely
beyond a shadow of a doubt know

1255
01:05:47,861 --> 01:05:48,694
they're going to be wrong.

1256
01:05:49,210 --> 01:05:52,000
You will come these talking heads on
television and people screaming you and

1257
01:05:52,001 --> 01:05:54,310
hidden bells and telling you what
to buy and the right, right, right.

1258
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:59,140
The best on earth, the right values,
right. The pebbles, the, you know,

1259
01:05:59,350 --> 01:06:02,250
I don't give it, who are you talking
about? You want to look at Carl Icahn.

1260
01:06:02,270 --> 01:06:03,700
They all know they're going to be wrong,

1261
01:06:03,970 --> 01:06:07,630
so they set up an asset location
system that will make them successful.

1262
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:10,330
They all agree. Acid allocation is
the single most important investment.

1263
01:06:10,331 --> 01:06:12,370
There wasn't one person
in terms of your vehicle,

1264
01:06:12,371 --> 01:06:14,350
but it wasn't most important thing.
No matter how they attacked it.

1265
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:18,250
Asset allocation was the element
there and the last one is they are,

1266
01:06:18,530 --> 01:06:22,240
they're lifelong learners. I mean, these
people aren't machines like you like me,

1267
01:06:22,241 --> 01:06:24,970
like Peter, like most of the
people you and I share as friends.

1268
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:28,600
They just are obsessed with knowing
more now because the more they know,

1269
01:06:28,601 --> 01:06:31,480
the more they realize what they didn't
know and then they apply that and they go

1270
01:06:31,481 --> 01:06:34,990
to another level and every time you think
you're the best you can be in anything

1271
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:37,420
in life, your body or motion,
Spirit, your finances,

1272
01:06:37,570 --> 01:06:40,490
there's always another level
and these guys live by it.

1273
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:43,780
And then the last one that I thought
almost all of them are real givers. Um,

1274
01:06:43,870 --> 01:06:46,830
not just give her some surface like
money givers and that's wonderful. Um,

1275
01:06:47,110 --> 01:06:51,250
but really passionate about giving and
did showed up once they saw what I was

1276
01:06:51,251 --> 01:06:53,020
doing was legitimate.
It was really real that,

1277
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:55,620
I mean then they're opening up three
hours of their time with something.

1278
01:06:55,740 --> 01:06:57,760
I think these guys will never go.
Oh yeah.

1279
01:06:57,820 --> 01:07:00,860
I mean their hours are worth a
lot to say. Wow. I same Elise,
