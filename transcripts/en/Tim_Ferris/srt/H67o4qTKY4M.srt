1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,890
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02,891 --> 00:00:06,220
I can run flat out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,500
I'm a cybernetic organism living tissue.

4
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:26,260
This episode is brought to you by audible.

5
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:30,250
Audible has the largest selection of
audio books on the planet and I've used

6
00:00:30,251 --> 00:00:32,290
audible for many,
many years.

7
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,530
I have several books to
recommend right off the bat.

8
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:39,850
Ready player one by Ernest Cline,
the Tao of Seneca by Seneca.

9
00:00:39,851 --> 00:00:43,300
If you want to hear my favorite letters
of all time put into compensation the

10
00:00:43,301 --> 00:00:45,010
graveyard book by Neil Gaiman.

11
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,370
If you're a nonfiction purist and
you want something to convert you,

12
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:52,660
this is one I've listened to multiple
times and right now if you're curious,

13
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,960
I'm listening to nonviolent communication
by Marshall Rosenberg and you can tell

14
00:00:58,571 --> 00:01:02,920
which one is the correct one because
it has a peace sign on the cover of the

15
00:01:02,921 --> 00:01:06,070
audio book and it's five
hours and nine minutes long.

16
00:01:06,071 --> 00:01:09,670
This was recommended to me by
Neil Strauss multiple time,

17
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:14,730
New York Times bestselling author and
audible has a lot going for it right now.

18
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,380
Among other things,
this is time sensitive.

19
00:01:17,381 --> 00:01:21,040
Amazon prime members can get
audible for just 495 a month.

20
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:24,280
That's $4 and 95 cents per month
for the first three months.

21
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,970
That's like getting three months for the
price of one and after that it's just

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,920
1495 per month.

27

next month.

28
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:52,360
If you don't like I give an audio book
that you've purchased or that you've

29
00:01:52,361 --> 00:01:55,240

30
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:58,540
Plus your audio books are yours to
keep forever. Even if you cancel.

31
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,060
Audio books are a great sidekick,

32
00:02:01,061 --> 00:02:04,840
a great secondary activity for any number
of things you might do this summer,

33
00:02:04,841 --> 00:02:08,380
like hiking, sunbathing, hanging out
on the beach, running road tripping,

34
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,420
whatever it might be.
Hiking outside.

35
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:15,370
I listened to audio books a lot when I'm
going on. Long walks, dog walks, cooking,

36
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:18,130
et cetera. Even working out
in between sets and so on.

37
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,930
And if you're someone who likes to binge,

38
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:23,200
this offer might be a good time to
start a series like game of Thrones,

39
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:26,320
Harry Potter, Outlander. The
list goes on and on. So again,

00:02:38,051 --> 00:02:39,880
three months.
Once again,

43
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,760
that's like getting three months for the
price of one and after that it's just

44
00:02:42,761 --> 00:02:47,440
1495 per month.
This offer ends July 31st,

45
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,273
2018 check it out.

46
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:51,703
Okay.

47
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,910
Hello,
this is Tim Ferriss.

48
00:02:53,911 --> 00:02:57,630
Welcome to another episode of the Tim
Ferriss Show where it is my job normally

49
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:01,000
to deconstruct world class
performers through interviews,

50
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,720
whether they're from business,
sports, entertainment, military,

51
00:03:04,721 --> 00:03:07,300
otherwise to tease out the habits,
routines,

52
00:03:07,301 --> 00:03:11,110
favorite books and so on that you can use.
In this episode,

53
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:16,060
I'm going to let someone else do
the heavy lifting and he's very,

54
00:03:16,061 --> 00:03:16,930
very qualified.

55
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:21,250
Reid Hoffman on linkedin
and Twitter as Reid Hoffman.

56
00:03:21,251 --> 00:03:26,251
Rei is a frequent flyer
of sorts on this show.

57
00:03:27,221 --> 00:03:31,930
He is often referred to as the oracle
of Silicon Valley by tech insiders who

58
00:03:31,931 --> 00:03:36,550
look at his company building and investing
track record with all the companies

59
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:41,410
include Facebook, Airbnb, Zynga,
flicker, and many, many, many others.

60
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,290
Read is well known as the
CO founder of Linkedin,

61
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:49,440
which has more than 300 million users
and sold to Microsoft for 26 point $2

62
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,050
billion. Prior to that, he was
exec vice president at paypal,

63
00:03:53,051 --> 00:03:55,720
which was purchased by
Ebay for 1.5 billion.

64
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:00,780
And at paypal he was nicknamed firefighter
in chief by the then CEO Peter Teal,

65
00:04:01,901 --> 00:04:06,901
who's also been on the podcast and read
is widely considered one of the most

66
00:04:06,971 --> 00:04:09,820
successful angel investors
of the past decade.

67
00:04:09,821 --> 00:04:13,930
He's now a partner at Greylock partners,
a top tier venture capital firm.

68
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:19,350
And on my phone there are
very few podcasts that I
listened to multiple times.

69
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:24,400
There are very few podcasts that I
recommend over and over and over again to

70
00:04:24,401 --> 00:04:26,020
other people,
especially entrepreneurs.

71
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:31,380
And what I'm going to showcase in this
episode is a conversation between read

72
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,420
and uh,

73
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:39,510
Brian Chesky who is a
cofounder and CEO of Airbnb.

74
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,880
And there are a couple of other cameos
and I'm doing this for a number of

75
00:04:42,881 --> 00:04:44,020
reasons.
Number one,

76
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:49,180
if you want to learn how to scale your
company from whatever the number might be,

77
00:04:49,181 --> 00:04:53,230
200 million, 200 million users, uh,

78
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:58,500
paradoxically you can increase
the likelihood of success
by doing things that do

79
00:04:58,901 --> 00:04:59,740
not scale.

80
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:04,990
And this is a really critical concept
to understand and it's best done through

81
00:05:04,991 --> 00:05:09,991
examples and that is why I want
to showcase this discussion,

82
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,720
which is from the first season
of masters of scale and I really,

83
00:05:16,121 --> 00:05:18,400
really hope you enjoy it.
Uh,

84
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,130
I loved it and Joe Gebbia,

85
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:26,190
cofounder of Airbnb has been on this
podcast before and we covered his

86
00:05:26,651 --> 00:05:31,651
development as a designer and an
entrepreneur leading up to the original

87
00:05:31,691 --> 00:05:34,120
development of the
business model for Airbnb.

88
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,850
That was part one and
I promised a part two.

89
00:05:36,851 --> 00:05:41,410
So this is in some ways that part too.
Exactly.

90
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:46,220
And a masters scale is a great show.
If you haven't seen it, it, uh,

91
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:50,110
showcases famous founders and
innovative leaders and so on,

92
00:05:50,111 --> 00:05:52,720
sharing their lessons for success.

93
00:05:52,721 --> 00:05:55,420
And there is a brand new
season out right now.

94
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:58,220
The new season includes
episodes with of Spotify,

95
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,390
Instagram, taskrabbit's, shake
shack, and glossier among many,

96
00:06:02,391 --> 00:06:07,190
many others. You can subscribe to master
the skill on apple podcasts or learn

so without further ado,

98
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:15,080
please enjoy this short
episode with Reid Hoffman,

99
00:06:15,081 --> 00:06:16,970
Brian Chesky and many others.

100
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:21,710
And if you've heard me recommend
1000 true fans to you many,

101
00:06:21,711 --> 00:06:25,430
many times before as the
article you should read.

102
00:06:25,431 --> 00:06:28,640
If you're only going to read one article
on marketing, which is by Kevin Kelly,

103
00:06:28,641 --> 00:06:33,641
you can find it on kk.org this
is the audio compliment to that.

104
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:38,690
So with much further ado, much
further ado, what much further ado,

105
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,100
please enjoy.

106
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,690
Joe and I are broke.

107
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,510
We're losing weight and I didn't
have a lot of weight to lose.

108
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,990
You know those binders that you put
baseball cards and we've a credit card to

109
00:06:50,991 --> 00:06:54,140
them at this point.
I am $25,000 in credit card debt.

110
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,020
Joe's tens of thousands
dollars in credit card debt.

111
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:00,350
So this is like make or break.
We need a lifeline

112
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:06,570
that entrepreneur and need of a lifeline.
That's Brian Chesky,

113
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:09,300
cofounder and CEO of Airbnb.

114
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:14,550
A service that lets you rent a couch
for the night or a cabin or a castle.

115
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:20,190
Today AIRBNB is valued at $30 billion.
Eight years ago,

116
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:21,840
a very different picture.

117
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:29,340
We had this website and maybe 50 people
a day are visiting it and we're probably

118
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:32,200
getting like 10 to 20 bookings
a day. So, and by the way,

119
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:33,100
didn't work out for a year and a half.

120
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:36,770
So for anyone who's worried your company
as an attraction, that was our traction.

121
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:39,950
It was 2008 and election
year in the United States.

122
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:42,470
Barack Obama was running
against John Mccain.

123
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:46,010
You needed the tax code that Brian was,

124
00:07:46,011 --> 00:07:50,840
that the Democratic national convention
hatching a PR campaign for Airbnb when

125
00:07:50,841 --> 00:07:53,540
they could rescue the company
and their credit card bills.

126
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:56,950
Joe and I look at each other and we said,
we're air bed and breakfast.

127
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,280
Air Beds aren't going so well. Maybe
breakfast. We'll as we thought,

128
00:08:00,281 --> 00:08:02,470
what if we could sell breakfast?
Maybe we can make some money.

129
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,990
What's a nonperishable breakfast cereal?

130
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,680
And so we thought the
presidential campaigns coming up,

131
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:09,970
we just launched at the DNC.

132
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:14,050
What if we created a Barack Obama
themed breakfast cereal? We thought,

133
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:16,660
what would it, Barack Obama
themed breakfast, he'll be called

134
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:22,060
Obama o's, like Cheerios, the
breakfast of change. We thought, well,

135
00:08:22,061 --> 00:08:23,500
we want to be a nonpartisan website,

136
00:08:23,501 --> 00:08:26,920
so we'd also have to need a John Mccain
themed cereal and that's a no brainer.

137
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:30,040
John Mccain was a captain, the
navy, and so we came up with

138
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:35,260
Captain Mccain's like captain crunch,
a maverick in every bite.

139
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:40,050
We ended up making a thousand boxes
of collectible breakfast cereal.

140
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,000
We sold them for $40 a box.

141
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:47,010
That's $40,000 not bad for pocket change
and it got them through a cash crunch,

142
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:51,960
but it came at a cost. We
had to physically make the
breakfast show ourselves,

143
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:56,990
meaning we get a printed poster board
and we had to fold it and hot glue it.

144
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:01,140
No one told me I had Haku breakfast
here and they should call it burn glue

145
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,540
because every time you get on you,
you burn.

146
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:07,860
You and I had the perfect one to one
ratio of burned a box and so I literally

147
00:09:07,861 --> 00:09:11,310
had to hot glue 1000 bucks a sterile at
one point in the middle of the night.

148
00:09:11,311 --> 00:09:14,550
I remember meeting, I wonder if when
Mark Zuckerberg started Facebook,

149
00:09:14,551 --> 00:09:15,750
he had the hot glue breakfast cereal.

150
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:18,090
The answer was no,
and this was not a good sign,

151
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:21,660
but what was a good sign was Brian's
willingness to work with his hands,

152
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:22,770
Burns and all.

153
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:27,710
I'd argue that painstaking handcrafted
Labor is actually the foundation of his

154
00:09:27,711 --> 00:09:31,360
success. In order to scale,
you have to do things right

155
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:36,480
that don't scale. You got to have
incredible talent at every position

156
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:39,990
there are fires burning
when you're going out

157
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:45,310
such an idiot and when you go back to
this is totally going to be amazing.

158
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,070
There are so many easy ways to do.
I have no idea what it is.

159
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,560
Sorry we made a mistake, but
you have to time it, right?

160
00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:00,610
Nepal, 10 years later, I can
say you do it. Just do it.

161
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,840
This is masters of scale.

162
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,370
Yeah.

163
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:11,300
I'm Reid Hoffman, Co, founder of
Linkedin partner Graylog and your host.

164
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:12,920
On this episode,

165
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:17,090
I'll make the case that the only way
an organization can truly scale is the

166
00:10:17,091 --> 00:10:19,160
first two things that don't scale at all.

167
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,090
I'll try to prove that theory through
stories from some of the smartest

168
00:10:23,091 --> 00:10:27,740
entrepreneurs I know over the last 20
years I've worked on or invest in in many

169
00:10:27,741 --> 00:10:32,210
companies that scale to 100 million
users or more. But here's the thing,

170
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:35,960
you don't start with 100 million users.
You start with a few,

171
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:40,700
so stop thinking big and start thinking
small hand serve your customers,

172
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,280
win them over one by one.
Now,

173
00:10:43,281 --> 00:10:47,180
this may sound like odd advice if you're
an entrepreneur with global ambitions.

174
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,500
Mark Zuckerberg didn't personally
invite 1.8 billion people to Facebook.

175
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:55,220
He built a great product and
the users just poured in, right?

176
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:58,070
Not exactly on this show.

177
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:02,690
I'll dispel that myth by talking to
founders who fought to win their users.

178
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,550
I'm starting with Brian Chesky,

179
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:09,640
CEO of Airbnb because he epitomizes the
idea of handcrafting the user experience

180
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:14,450
before you start to scale.
It's a principal. He first
absorbed in design school.

181
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,690
I was doing medical design ones.
I designed a children's ventilator.

182
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:23,360
I had to sit in the shoes, the child and
so I had to like imagine being a child,

183
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:27,230
get in like the operating table and like
you have to put yourself in the shoes

184
00:11:27,231 --> 00:11:30,950
of the patient where the person using
your product and if you're only doing ab

185
00:11:30,951 --> 00:11:32,900
tests like you're never
designing with empathy.

186
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,560
But a funny thing happened to Brian
when he moved to silicon valley,

187
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:40,610
he sort of forgot about designing
with empathy for a single user.

188
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,850
It's a common mistake amongst
entrepreneurs with global ambitions.

189
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:48,200
They have to promise investors the world,
tens of millions of customers,

190
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:52,580
billions in revenue. It's
intoxicating. Just listen to Brian Go.

191
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,280
This is a travel industry

192
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:56,770
that is something like 7% of global GDP,

193
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:02,170
somewhere between five and $7 trillion
10 times the market size of Google's

194
00:12:02,171 --> 00:12:06,220
market size and Brian might've stayed
in the stratosphere if not for a fateful

195
00:12:06,221 --> 00:12:09,190
meeting with Paul Graham
Co founder of y Combinator.

196
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:14,200
Y Combinator is a startup incubator which
cultivates and invests in early stage

197
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:15,034
companies.

198
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:19,570
Brian was admitted to y Combinator in
2009 and his first meeting with Paul was

199
00:12:19,571 --> 00:12:20,404
confounding.

200
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:25,330
Paul tends to stump people
with deceptively simple
question and he asked us,

201
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,750
where's your business? And I go, what do
you mean? Like where's the traction? I go,

202
00:12:28,751 --> 00:12:31,450
well, we don't have a lot of traction.
He goes, well, people must be using it.

203
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,350
I said,

204
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:35,440
there's a few people in New York using
it and you've said something I'll never

205
00:12:35,441 --> 00:12:36,880
forget. He said, sue sewer,

206
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:40,120
your users are in New York and you're
still in mountain view. I said, yeah.

207
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:42,970
He said, what are you still doing here?
And I go, what do you mean? He said,

208
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:47,770
go to your users, get to know them, get
your customers one by one. And I said,

209
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:50,650
what? That won't scale before.
Hugely millions of customers.

210
00:12:50,651 --> 00:12:52,720
We can't meet every customer.
And he said,

211
00:12:52,721 --> 00:12:55,930
that's exactly why you should do it now
because this is the only time you'll

212
00:12:55,931 --> 00:12:57,940
ever be small enough that you
can meet all your customers,

213
00:12:57,941 --> 00:12:59,920
get to know them and make
something directly for them.

214
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:03,010
Brian and his cofounders followed
his advice to the letter.

215
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:05,200
We literally community in
Newark from mountain view.

216
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,930
So we would be in why com era for a,

217
00:13:07,931 --> 00:13:12,100
was it Tuesday night dinners and then
Wednesday Joe and I would go to New York.

218
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:15,820
We literally would knock on the doors
of all of our hosts and we had their

219
00:13:15,821 --> 00:13:19,210
addresses and we say, knock,
knock, hello. Hey, this is Brian.

220
00:13:19,211 --> 00:13:20,860
Joe were founders who
just want to meet you.

221
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,800
It's a little creepy just to
knock on the door on announced.

222
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:25,390
We need to excuse it,
like in their home.

223
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:28,960
So they came up with an offer
that the host couldn't refuse.

224
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:32,380
We'd send a professional photographer
to your home and photograph your home.

225
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,740
Of course, we didn't have any money and
we couldn't have played photographers.

226
00:13:35,741 --> 00:13:38,290
So Joe and I, we'd show up at
their door and they're like, wow,

227
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,400
this company is pretty small. These home
visits became AIRBNB's secret weapon.

228
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,010
It's how they learned what people loved.

229
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,890
It's really hard to get even
10 people to love anything,

230
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,590
but it's not hard if you
spend a ton of time with them.

231
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,740
So if I want to make something amazing,
I just spend time with you. And I'm like,

232
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,960
well what if I did this?
What if I did this?

233
00:13:55,961 --> 00:14:00,640
What if I did this from those questions?
A handcrafted experience is born.

234
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:04,720
We'd find out, hey, I don't
feel comfortable the guests,
I don't know who they are.

235
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:07,420
Well, what if we had a profiles? Great.
Well what do you want your profile?

236
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,270
But I want a photo. Great, what
else? I want to know where they work,

237
00:14:10,271 --> 00:14:11,500
where they went to school.
Okay,

238
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,490
so you add that stuff and then you
literally start designing touchpoint by

239
00:14:15,491 --> 00:14:19,630
touchpoint.
The creation of the peer review system,

240
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,020
customer support. All of these
things came from us. Literally.

241
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:24,970
We didn't just meet our users,
we live with them.

242
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,830
And I used to joke that
when you bought an iPhone,

243
00:14:26,831 --> 00:14:29,620
Steve Jobs didn't come sleep
on your couch. But I did. Yes.

244
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:32,890
Was there a particular experience
that has really stuck in your mind?

245
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:36,980
I remember we met with a couple
of hosts and it's winter,

246
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:41,300
it's snowing outside and we're like
in snow boots and we walk up to the

247
00:14:41,301 --> 00:14:45,830
apartment and we went there to
photograph the homes and we're like, Hey,

248
00:14:45,831 --> 00:14:49,760
I'll upload your photos to the website.
Um, do you have any other feedback?

249
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,310
And he comes back a book binder

250
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:57,760
and he's got like dozens of pages of
notes and he ends up creating like a

251
00:14:58,431 --> 00:15:01,700
product roadmap for us. Like we should
have this, this, this, this, this.

252
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:05,000
And we're like, oh my God, this is
our roadmap because he's the customer.

253
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:10,280
And I think that always stuck in our
mind as the roadmap often exists in the

254
00:15:10,281 --> 00:15:12,110
minds of the users you're
designing things for.

255
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:16,970
And it's typical to get very detailed
feedback from some of your early users.

256
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:21,290
And if you're not getting some people
who say, this is super important to me,

257
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:25,790
I love this. I really need this to work
well. It usually means you're off track.

258
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:30,560
Passionate feedback is a clue that your
product really matters to someone and

259
00:15:30,561 --> 00:15:34,400
one passionate user can turn into many.
If you listen to them carefully,

260
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,690
it's essential to get this kind of
feedback early while you're still defining

261
00:15:38,691 --> 00:15:42,080
the product. It's like setting
a foundation. As an architect,

262
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,660
you wouldn't build a skyscraper before.

263
00:15:44,661 --> 00:15:48,590
You've built a solid foundation user
feedback and sure as you won't build a

264
00:15:48,591 --> 00:15:51,020
dozen floors on an unstable swamp.

265
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:55,250
Brian is a simple method for extracting
detailed feedback from users.

266
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,650
He doesn't ask what the
product he already built.

267
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,220
He asks about the product of the dreams.
We'd ask these questions like,

268
00:16:01,221 --> 00:16:05,210
what can we do as surprise you? Like
what could we do not to make this better,

269
00:16:05,211 --> 00:16:08,420
but they make you tell everyone about it
and the answer is different. If I say,

270
00:16:08,421 --> 00:16:10,310
what can I do to make this better?
That they'll say something small.

271
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,421
If I were to say read,

272
00:16:11,421 --> 00:16:14,510
what would it take for me to design
something that you would literally tell

273
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,900
every single person you've
ever encountered and you
start to ask these questions

274
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,360
and it really helps you
think through this problem.

275
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,420
It's essential to seek out
and listen to user feedback,

276
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:26,960
but the caveat is you have to
figure out which users to listen to.

277
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:30,860
You're going to have different kinds of
users giving you feedback and some of it

278
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:32,600
will take you in the wrong direction.

279
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:35,450
So you need to exercise
judgment and discerning, well,

280
00:16:35,451 --> 00:16:39,290
this particular user and particular
feedback lead me to the mass market,

281
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,570
or is it an edge case?
For example,

282
00:16:41,571 --> 00:16:45,080
at Linkedin we had one group of users
who invent a name for themselves.

283
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:46,850
They call themselves lions,

284
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,500
which is linkedin open networkers because
their theory of the world was that

285
00:16:51,501 --> 00:16:55,430
everyone wants to directly connect to
everyone else in the world because that's

286
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:59,090
the way they wanted it, but they're
actually not the majority case.

287
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,010
A lot of people who are very busy,

288
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,510
how have access resources who have
some celebrity status do not want that.

289
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:09,080
And if we've followed their feedback,
linkedin would not be where it is today.

290
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:13,340
We had to steer away from a bunch
of passionate users who told us very

291
00:17:13,341 --> 00:17:16,970
explicitly that we were fools
for not following their advice.

292
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,720
If you want to build
something that's truly viral,

293
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:25,750
you have to create a total like
experience that you tell everyone about.

294
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:30,500
And so we basically took one part of our
product and we extrapolated what would

295
00:17:30,501 --> 00:17:34,160
a five star experience be?
And we went crazy. So a one,

296
00:17:34,161 --> 00:17:37,490
two or three star experience is you
get to airbnb and no one's there.

297
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:42,500
So you knock on the door, they
don't open. That's the one star,

298
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,110
you know, and maybe it's a
three star. If they don't open,

299
00:17:45,111 --> 00:17:48,200
you had to wait 20 minutes and if they
never show up and you're pissed and you

300
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:50,310
to get her money back, that's one
star you never union says again.

301
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:54,260
So a five star experience is you
knock on the door, they open the door,

302
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,300
they let you in. Great.
That's not a big deal.

303
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,300
You're not going to tell every friend
about it. You might say, I used Airbnb,

304
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,660
it worked. So we thought, what
would a six star experience be?

305
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:08,940
A six star experience. Knock on the
door. The host opens. Hey, I'm reed,

306
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:11,130
welcome to my house.
You're the host in this case.

307
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:16,580
And you would show them around and
on the table would be a welcome gift.

308
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,600
You would be a bottle of wine, maybe
some candy, you'd open the fridge,

309
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,250
there's water,
you go to the bathroom,

310
00:18:23,251 --> 00:18:26,760
this toiletries and the whole thing is
great. That's a six star experience.

311
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:29,280
And you'd say, wow, I love
this more than a hotel.

312
00:18:29,281 --> 00:18:32,010
I'm definitely gonna use airbnb again.
It worked better than I expected.

313
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:37,010
What's a seven star experience? Knock
on the door. Reid Hoffman opened.

314
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:42,510
Get in, welcome. Here's by full
kitchen. I know you like surfing,

315
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:45,870
there's a surf board waiting for you.
I booked lessons for you.

316
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,260
It's going to be an amazing experience.
And by the way, here's my car.

317
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:53,430
If you can use my car and um, you
know, I also want to surprise you,

318
00:18:53,431 --> 00:18:57,660
but I got you. This is best restaurant
in the city of San Francisco.

319
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,420
I got you a table there and you're like,
whoa.

320
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:04,110
Like this is way beyond adding
stars clearly excites Brian.

321
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,780
It took some time to run
through this mental exercise.

322
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,880
We'll skip ahead to
the 10 star experience.

323
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:11,040
So would a 10 star check and be a chance.

324
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:16,041
Our check in would be the Beatles checkin
in 1964 I get off the plane and they'd

325
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:20,550
be 5,000 high school kids
cheering my name with cars,

326
00:19:20,551 --> 00:19:21,990
welcoming me to the country.

327
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,440
I get to the front yard of your house
and they'd be a press conference for me

328
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:30,390
and I would be just a mind experience.
So what would 11 star experience be?

329
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:34,320
I would show up the airport and you'd be
there with Elon Musk and you're saying

330
00:19:34,321 --> 00:19:35,154
you're going to space

331
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,490
the point of the processes that
maybe nine 10 11 are not feasible.

332
00:19:41,491 --> 00:19:44,250
But if you go through the
crazy exercise of keep going,

333
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:46,470
there's some sweet spot between,

334
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:49,620
they showed up in the open
the door and I went to space.

335
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:54,750
That's the sweet spot and you have
to almost design the extreme to come

336
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:58,470
backwards suddenly doesn't just like
having like knowing my preferences and

337
00:19:58,471 --> 00:20:01,170
having a Surf Board in the house
seem like not crazy and reasonable.

338
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,090
It's actually kind of crazy logistically,

339
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:06,360
but this is the kind of stuff
that creates great experience.

340
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:10,960
How far do you go toward the 11 star
experience to create the Nirvana product?

341
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:15,190
All successful entrepreneurs at some
point have to come back down to earth.

342
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:19,510
There's really two stages of a
startup's product. The first design,

343
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:22,570
a perfect experience, and then you
scale that experience and that's it.

344
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,080
But which part of the perfect
experience do you scale?

345
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:30,160
So the most ambitious entrepreneurs,
let's call them the Elan's,

346
00:20:30,161 --> 00:20:34,240
after my friend Elon Musk probably get
there through raw energy because they're

347
00:20:34,241 --> 00:20:35,950
convinced they need to solve a problem.

348
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:40,330
And the unscalable thing is one step
that they have to push through on the way

349
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,090
the Elan say,
I'm going to Mars,

350
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:46,150
but first I've got to solve this
problem right in front of me first.

351
00:20:46,151 --> 00:20:49,360
I need to get that rocket and I need
to have a business model for that.

352
00:20:49,361 --> 00:20:52,360
First rocket and that looks
like satellites. Okay,

353
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:55,660
I'm going to try satellite launches
and how do I get my first rocket?

354
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:58,180
I need to create a
scalable rocket platform.

355
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:00,940
But unless they get the first rocket up,
it doesn't matter.

356
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:05,260
And you kind of work back to that.
Then you've got folks like Brian who say,

357
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,600
I realize that to get
this awesome experience,

358
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,810
I have to ratchet back to something
that still seems like magic,

359
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,950
but it's totally doable.

360
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,420
And then I need to design the elements
that get me into the totally doable thing.

361
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:19,510
So how does Brian decide
on the doable thing?

362
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:23,830
He settled on a service with
the appropriate level of
magic and started building

363
00:21:23,831 --> 00:21:25,930
it.
And here's the next thing to notice.

364
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:30,520
They didn't launch perfectly scaled
services. They built everything by hand.

365
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:31,320
We had

366
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,080
saying that you would do
everything by hand tools painful.

367
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,360
So Joe and I would photograph
home sells painful.

368
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:39,000
Then we get up at arbors that we manage
them with spreadsheets til it's painful.

369
00:21:39,001 --> 00:21:39,834
Then we've got an intern.

370
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:44,210
I don't think I knew how anything
would grow to the level that it did.

371
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,440
That's Ellie feel. She's the intern
who manage those spreadsheets.

372
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:48,970
She still works at Airbnb

373
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,110
very manually.

374
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:55,480
I would email the photographer and
the host and connect to them and the

375
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:59,670
photographer would then
send me the photos. Um,

376
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:03,880
I would go through each one giving
feedback if they needed to be retouched,

377
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:08,290
and then I would manually upload
them to the hosts website.

378
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,620
They're listing one by one.
It would take hours to upload.

379
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:14,080
Multitasking was the name of the game,

380
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:17,030
and then we automate the tools
to make her more efficient.

381
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:19,920
And we kind of looked at this and we said,
okay,

382
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:22,860
what is the easiest thing
that we can automate?

383
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,450
Any little thing that changed was,
you know,

384
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,500
quite a shift in what I had been doing,
but for the better.

385
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:33,330
And I remember one day Brian would
come to me at the end of every day,

386
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:37,500
how many did we get, how many photos
were shot? And it was like, oh gosh,

387
00:22:37,501 --> 00:22:39,060
I have to go through
and count all of these.

388
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:41,160
And then eventually a
system does everything.

389
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:44,250
We built a system where now with
the host comes, you press a button,

390
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,740
it alerts our system, which goes
to a dispatcher, photographers.

391
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:50,760
It's all managed through our technology.
They get the job,

392
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:53,900
they mark it through an app that
we built and then payment happens.

393
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,080
The whole thing is automated.
Now

394
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:59,530
note how they gradually worked out a
solution they didn't guess at what users

395
00:22:59,531 --> 00:22:59,980
wanted.

396
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:03,760
They reacted to what users asked for
and then they met the demand through a

397
00:23:03,761 --> 00:23:04,990
piecemeal process.

398
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:09,100
And here we come to the true art
of doing things that don't scale.

399
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:12,670
It's not just a crude way of
succeeding on a shoe string budget.

400
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:18,420
It also gives your team inspiration and
urgency to build the features that users

401
00:23:18,881 --> 00:23:23,260
really want. I've seen this handcrafting
story play out over and over again with

402
00:23:23,261 --> 00:23:27,770
entrepreneurs. Take my friend Patrick
Collison, he's the founding CEO,

403
00:23:27,771 --> 00:23:30,370
stripe and online payments company.
Today,

404
00:23:30,371 --> 00:23:33,640
thousands of businesses use stripe
to process payments from their online

405
00:23:33,641 --> 00:23:34,474
customers,

406
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:38,410
but in the early days they were a
scrappy startup and Patrick paid close

407
00:23:38,411 --> 00:23:42,790
attention to his users, very close
attention. We had a chat room,

408
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:43,970
uh,

409
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:47,660
where we would just help customers both
whatever issue that they wanted to ask

410
00:23:47,661 --> 00:23:48,440
about.

411
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:51,110
And we were very distressed if for a
while to notice that occasionally it would

412
00:23:51,111 --> 00:23:54,800
come into the chat room, Holger of
sleeping and ask a question, you know,

413
00:23:54,801 --> 00:23:57,470
they wouldn't get any response.
And so we wrote a Bot,

414
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:00,680
they were just page one of us.
If somebody asks a question,

415
00:24:00,681 --> 00:24:03,480
they didn't get a response after more
than 30 seconds or something and someone

416
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,360
would kind of groggily bleary eyed,

417
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:09,360
wake up and like help imagine and get back
to sleep. So in addition to being CEO,

418
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:12,660
Patrick had become stripe's
bleary eyed customer service rep,

419
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:16,970
frustrated users would page him at all
hours. It sure did not feel glamorous.

420
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:19,780
You just tapping away on my
laptop for half an hour in beds.

421
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:21,100
Actually that reminds me,

422
00:24:21,101 --> 00:24:23,440
I don't know if you know Paul
English who founded Kayak.

423
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:28,540
Kayak is an online travel service that
finds the lowest available rates across

424
00:24:28,541 --> 00:24:32,860
different websites. We noticed
a little bit. Yeah. Paul, um,

425
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:36,190
for a number of years and Kayak had
his cell phone number as the customer

426
00:24:36,191 --> 00:24:39,130
service number. W we
also had one of our, uh,

427
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:41,470
there's some of that stripe two
who did exactly the same thing.

428
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:45,300
Now it's common for entrepreneurs to swap
stories like this and they think it's

429
00:24:45,301 --> 00:24:49,260
worth dwelling on these early days
of handcrafted work because most

430
00:24:49,261 --> 00:24:52,200
entrepreneurs tend to have a funny
reaction to these experiences.

431
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:55,770
They may laugh about it later.
They may call the work unglamorous.

432
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,880
They may celebrate the day.

433
00:24:56,881 --> 00:25:00,600
They could hire a helping hand or
automate these chores out of existence.

434
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:04,200
But thoughtful founders will never
say what a complete waste of time.

435
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:09,630
They'll often look back on this period
as one of the most creative phases of

436
00:25:09,631 --> 00:25:12,780
their careers. Nancy Lublin, for instance,

437
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:17,460
scrappily launched an
international nonprofit from
our New York City apartment.

438
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:22,530
Her Organization dress for success
started as a clothing drive for women who

439
00:25:22,531 --> 00:25:26,370
needed to walk into a job interview
looking sharp and feeling confident.

440
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:30,360
Nancy stockpiled sweaters on her
bed and jewelry and refrigerator.

441
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:35,220
And soon she was inviting volunteers
into our apartment for informal training

442
00:25:35,221 --> 00:25:35,940
sessions.

443
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:39,060
So people start hearing about dress
for success and would contact me.

444
00:25:39,061 --> 00:25:42,330
Just random people would contact me and
say, I want to start this in St Louis.

445
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:44,640
I want to start this in
Hartford and I would say, great,

446
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:45,780
you want to come stay with me?

447
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:49,740
People literally strangers would fly
from St Louis and stay on my Futon,

448
00:25:49,741 --> 00:25:53,910
my college futon in my tiny like law
school apartment in New York and I'd be

449
00:25:53,911 --> 00:25:57,510
like, how can I help? And I would
send them postcards like saying like,

450
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:59,130
don't give up.
I know it's really hard.

451
00:25:59,131 --> 00:26:01,740
You got this and I just
killed them with kindness.

452
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:06,520
Today dress for success has
affiliates and 145 cities worldwide.

453
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:07,540
But let's be clear,

454
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:12,130
the transition from the handcrafted
phase to the massive scale phase is a

455
00:26:12,131 --> 00:26:16,300
challenging one and I wanted to spell any
illusions that you can switch from one

456
00:26:16,301 --> 00:26:20,380
to the other with ease. In fact,
it requires two opposing mindsets.

457
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:24,220
You have to fully empathize with a
single user at the same time you have to

458
00:26:24,221 --> 00:26:27,370
worry about everyone. I like the way
that Brian describes the difference.

459
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:30,490
The designing of experience is a different
part of your brain. Then the skilling,

460
00:26:30,491 --> 00:26:32,140
your spirits.
It's a different skill set.

461
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:36,550
The scale and experience is a highly
analytical operations oriented nick tology

462
00:26:36,551 --> 00:26:37,384
oriented problem.

463
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:42,370
The designing of the experience is a
more intuition based human empathetic end

464
00:26:42,371 --> 00:26:43,410
to end experience.

465
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,610
One parallel might be writing and editing,

466
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:48,370
so the hand crafted phase
tends to be more like writing.

467
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,830
It's a more inventive
and creative process.

468
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:53,740
Whereas the scaling phase
tends to be more analytical.

469
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:57,220
It's more like being an editor at that
point. You tend to do more pruning.

470
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:59,650
You realize, well, this
whole thing is magical,

471
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:03,130
but if we focus on this 20%
we get 80% of the magic.

472
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,110
So you prune you compact,

473
00:27:05,111 --> 00:27:09,250
you distill and you architect so
can now run at a rocket ship rate.

474
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:13,300
You're transitioning the product or
service over to a scale organization that

475
00:27:13,301 --> 00:27:14,134
can now run it.

476
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:18,070
The organization needs a simple plan
with very few errors and very little

477
00:27:18,071 --> 00:27:21,280
improvisation.
Now you might think the first step design,

478
00:27:21,281 --> 00:27:24,460
the ideal user experience drops away
as soon as your product goes viral.

479
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:27,880
Then comes the glamorous work of expanding
a new countries and thinking about

480
00:27:27,881 --> 00:27:29,200
your strategy in the years ahead.

481
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:33,430
Handcrafted work is essentially a kind
of booster rocket that helps you get an

482
00:27:33,431 --> 00:27:36,250
orbit, but it's not the kind of
rock and for the whole trajectory.

483
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:40,450
It gets you out of the gravity well and
after that get ready to slingshot around

484
00:27:40,451 --> 00:27:41,284
the world,

485
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:47,470
it became an international company.
Then middle of 2011 we raised money.

486
00:27:47,471 --> 00:27:50,830
We were like this billion
dollar evaluation company
and then in summer 2011 a

487
00:27:50,831 --> 00:27:53,320
woman's home got trashed and then
we had to go to the next step,

488
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:55,750
which was we are just this
little company department.

489
00:27:55,751 --> 00:27:58,030
But as far as the world's concerned,
we have a giant office building.

490
00:27:58,031 --> 00:28:02,170
We better be grownups.
So we had to build 24 seven support,

491
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,120
had to have more secure
payment instruments.

492
00:28:04,121 --> 00:28:06,880
We had to add a trust and safety team.
We had to verify people's identity.

493
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,160
We realize we have to get our
money transmission licenses.

494
00:28:09,161 --> 00:28:12,940
So then there's this
whole like administrative
bureaucracy that gets added.

495
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:17,350
Then 2012 we get to the point we are,

496
00:28:17,351 --> 00:28:19,900
we have like 50 a hundred employees.
We have no executive team.

497
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:22,870
There's no management. There's
no like company meetings.
There's no communication.

498
00:28:22,871 --> 00:28:26,440
So no one knows anything. Look,
literally nothing. I don't,

499
00:28:26,441 --> 00:28:27,610
I don't even know how we ran the company.

500
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:31,330
And so I instituted some basic things
like I have to have an executive team and

501
00:28:31,331 --> 00:28:34,210
then the lawsuits come in and
you have to really sort it out.

502
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,660
And unfortunately we're not regulate
the federal level regularly at the city

503
00:28:37,661 --> 00:28:41,590
level. And every city is different and
they're like, I see what you did in Paris,

504
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:44,020
but here in New York were different.

505
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:48,700
I see it to go city by city and you've
got to hire those people to really triage

506
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:52,420
and deal with all these issues.
It's like a video game.

507
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:55,720
You slay a dragon,
you think you've completed the board game,

508
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:58,810
and then you have the next level and all
of a sudden the dragons get really big.

509
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:00,710
But when you're slaying dragons,

510
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,250
it's hard to hold onto the
handcrafted mindset still.

511
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:08,240
I would argue that the sharpest founders
never fully abandoned the mindset,

512
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,520
no matter how big their company goes.

513
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:16,310
And so the organization will start having
antibodies against new handcrafted.

514
00:29:16,311 --> 00:29:20,930
Then it's a response that protects
organizational efficiency. It says,

515
00:29:20,931 --> 00:29:25,250
look, this new thing, we can't get
it to scale. It won't operationalize.

516
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,110
It won't fit within our process.

517
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:31,520
The reason the scaled companies have a
hard time with is handcrafted process is

518
00:29:31,521 --> 00:29:34,280
all in the list of objections
about why this won't work,

519
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,470
why this shouldn't be integrated
as part of the company.

520
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:40,400
And so what you need to do as a founder
is be extremely choiceful about which

521
00:29:40,401 --> 00:29:44,410
handcrafted you choose and how
you protect it. Organizationally.

522
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:49,090
You need to protect it because the
natural reaction of the scale organization

523
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,170
will be to kill it.

524
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:54,700
He wanted to reinvent the industry again
and he knew he had more to learn about

525
00:29:54,701 --> 00:29:56,230
the travel experience in order to do it.

526
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,010
So he turned to Hollywood for help.

527
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,760
I often find that to reinvent an industry,

528
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:05,130
you're not taking inspiration
directly from that industry,

529
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:08,280
that you need to look at
orthogonal industries and for us,

530
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:12,480
the orthogonal industry to travel with
cinema and the best ships you've ever

531
00:30:12,481 --> 00:30:17,040
seen are the trips that characters and
movies have and that we would provide

532
00:30:17,041 --> 00:30:18,600
that analogy in real life.

533
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,590
And I actually literally
hired a storyboard artist
and Pixar and we had them

534
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,320
storyboard the perfect airbnb experience.
When we did that,

535
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:29,340
we realized there was like this two hour
movie and only 20 minutes we're in the

536
00:30:29,341 --> 00:30:33,960
home. There was all this like leading
up to the home, getting the airport,

537
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:37,620
going around, going to dinner, hanging out
with friends out and about and be like,

538
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,240
most of the trip was not in the home,

539
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:43,560
but we realize that point we need to be
in the end to end business of travel.

540
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:48,330
So the same way that he did things that
don't scale, we call them magical trips.

541
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,810
We decided let's find one traveler
and create the perfect trip for them.

542
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:57,410
Notice how quickly Brian
turns his attention to a
single traveler in an instant.

543
00:30:57,450 --> 00:31:02,450
He switches from global concerns back
to is artisanal roots and that's because

544
00:31:03,121 --> 00:31:07,110
he's building something radically new
here. He wants to scale the perfect trip,

545
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,090
but what is the perfect trip?

546
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:13,380
What are the essential ingredients
that make a vacation truly memorable?

547
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:18,450
It's a question that Brian can't even
begin to answer until he delivers that

548
00:31:18,451 --> 00:31:20,070
experience to at least one person.

549
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:24,090
You're about to get a
masterclass in handcrafting.

550
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:28,250
So we put up these flyers
as anonymously saying,

551
00:31:28,251 --> 00:31:32,480
seeking a traveler will photograph your
trip to San Francisco if you let us

552
00:31:32,481 --> 00:31:34,880
follow you. This guy,
Martin Ricardo replied,

553
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:39,560
he was from London and we send a
photographer around him while he was just

554
00:31:39,561 --> 00:31:42,710
traveling to San Francisco.
What we learned was his trip was awful.

555
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:45,950
Like he'd show up,
he'd go to Alcatraz by himself,

556
00:31:45,951 --> 00:31:49,370
put on the headset and then you go to
Bubba Gump shrimp. He'd stay in like, uh,

557
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:52,610
like budget hotel.
He'd go to a hotel bar by himself,

558
00:31:52,611 --> 00:31:54,650
like sitting like with a
bunch of dudes at the bar

559
00:31:56,550 --> 00:32:00,560
and talk to anyone cause he's introverted.
We call them back. You say, Ricardo,

560
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,200
we want to create the perfect
trip to San Francisco for you.

561
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,920
You fly him back and we
had the team storyboard,

562
00:32:06,921 --> 00:32:08,390
the perfect experience for Airbnb.

563
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:12,350
We had a driver pick them up the airport
and we took them to the perfect airbnb.

564
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:15,980
They're all these services.
He went on these dinner parties,

565
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:18,040
we got in the best seats at restaurant.

566
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:20,390
We took them on as
midnight mystery bike tour,

567
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:23,790
like 60 riders go on it and nobody,
but the leader knows what.

568
00:32:23,791 --> 00:32:27,650
We'll end up and it's just like
there was this crazy, magical world.

569
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:32,690
I see him at the end of the trip.
I say, how was your trip? He says,

570
00:32:32,691 --> 00:32:37,010
it was amazing, and then I
walk away, yells at me, Brian,

571
00:32:37,011 --> 00:32:41,780
one more thing and starts like crying
and he breaks down a thank you.

572
00:32:41,781 --> 00:32:46,540
This is the best trip I've ever
had. I was like, oh my God.

573
00:32:46,541 --> 00:32:49,750
I guess it kind of kind of worked like
it really moved him because I don't think

574
00:32:49,751 --> 00:32:53,350
anyone ever tried to like design end to
end experience or somebody like they're

575
00:32:53,351 --> 00:32:57,820
in a movie before and we did it.
That became a blueprint and we said,

576
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:03,150
we are confident on an unscalable basis
that we know how to create a trip that

577
00:33:03,701 --> 00:33:06,370
deeply moves somebody is better than
anything they've ever experienced.

578
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:11,140
The question is, can we
develop a technology scales
and do 100 million times?

579
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:16,160
Notice here how quickly Brian
Switches back to the analytic mindset.

580
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:20,150
He can extrapolate from a single journey
to a list of essential ingredients.

581
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:23,570
Here's the systematic
breakdown of the perfect trip.

582
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:27,730
When you first go to city,
you need a welcome event
within the first 24 48 hours.

583
00:33:27,731 --> 00:33:31,450
We are around people. When you land and
you get acclimated to the neighborhood,

584
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:35,770
that by day two or three, you need to
have a challenge out of your comfort zone.

585
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:40,140
If you do not leave your comfort zone,
you do not remember the trip, okay?

586
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:44,950
And if you can belong out of your comfort
zone and something new happens to you,

587
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:49,150
then there's going to be
a moment of transformation
where the person you were in

588
00:33:49,151 --> 00:33:53,050
a small way dies at a new,
better version of yourself is reborn.

589
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:57,040
Now, this is the narrative of
every movie you've ever seen.

590
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:00,760
A main character starts in the ordinary
world. They leave their ordinary world,

591
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:05,710
they cross the threshold to a new magical
world where all these obstacles happen

592
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:09,700
and the overcome something and
they call it the hero's journey.

593
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:14,770
And we applied this to trips,
build a small team,

594
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,710
and we spent the last couple of
years figuring out how to scale this.

595
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:22,360
And this has led to what we have today,
which we call airbnb trips.

596
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:28,770
In November of 2016 Brian unveiled 500
ship packages in 12 cities and now he's

597
00:34:29,231 --> 00:34:30,580
fully in the scaling mindset,

598
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:33,250
figuring out how to expand the
service to new destinations.

599
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:36,100
But as Brian will tell you,
he misses the handcrafted work.

600
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:40,810
Here's a surprising message
for entrepreneurs who have
only a handful of users

601
00:34:40,811 --> 00:34:41,644
to serve.

602
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:45,390
I kind of tell a lot entrepreneurs who
don't have traction, I miss those times.

603
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:46,261
I mean it,
yes,

604
00:34:46,261 --> 00:34:49,080
it's exciting to have traction and have
a super sense like companies like huge

605
00:34:49,081 --> 00:34:52,920
scale, but the biggest leaps you
ever get as when you're small.

606
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:55,440
And another way of saying it
is your product changes less.

607
00:34:55,441 --> 00:34:58,950
The bigger you get because there's
bigger, more customers, more below back,

608
00:34:58,951 --> 00:35:00,540
more systems,
more legacy.

609
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:05,870
The most innovative leaps you'll ever
make often, especially for your network,

610
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:08,060
are going to be when you're really,
really small,

611
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:10,550
you can change the protocol
a whole entirely in a week.

612
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:14,060
Try doing that at Linkedin or airbnb
today, that'd be a huge disaster.

613
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:17,480
So I think taking
advantage of that subscale,

614
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:21,560
designing the perfect experience, asking
yourself what you could do is amazing.

615
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,120
And if you have a teeny startup,

616
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:28,660
good news for you now is the moment you
can take the most daring leaps to your

617
00:35:28,661 --> 00:35:31,600
career.
Dream big and act small.

618
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:36,400
Pay Passionate attention to your users,
handcraft the core service for them,

619
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:38,250
create magical experience

620
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:43,640
and then figure out what part of that
magical handcrafted thing can scale.

621
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,670
I'm Reid Hoffman.
Thank you for listening.

622
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,980
Masters of scale is a wait.

630
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:26,820
Hey guys, this is Tim again. Just a
few more things before you take off.

631
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:29,790
Number one,
this is five bullet Friday.

632
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:33,090
Do you want to get a short email from me?

633
00:36:33,091 --> 00:36:37,230
Would you enjoy getting a short email
from me every Friday that provides a

634
00:36:37,231 --> 00:36:40,770
little more soul of fun before the
weekend and five bullet Friday is a very

635
00:36:40,771 --> 00:36:45,120
short email where I share the coolest
things I've found or that I've been

636
00:36:45,121 --> 00:36:46,440
pondering over the week.

637
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:49,410
That could include favorite new
albums that I've discovered.

638
00:36:49,411 --> 00:36:52,890
It could include Gizmos and gadgets
and all sorts of weird shit that I've

639
00:36:52,891 --> 00:36:57,180
somehow dug up in the other
world of the esoteric as I do.

640
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:02,480
It could include favorite articles that
I've read and that I've shared with my

641
00:37:03,121 --> 00:37:05,850
close friends, for instance,
and it's very short.

642
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:10,890
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness
before you head off for the weekend,

643
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,140
so if you want to receive that,
check it out.

644
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:18,360

645
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:22,350
and just drop in your email and you will
get the very next one if you sign up.

646
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:26,070
I hope you enjoy it.
This episode is brought to you by audible.

647
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:30,180
Audible has the largest selection of
audio books on the planet and I've used

648
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:32,220
audible for many,
many years.

649
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:37,140
I have several books to recommend right
off the bat. Ready player one by Ernest,

650
00:37:37,141 --> 00:37:39,810
climb the Tao of Seneca by Seneca.

651
00:37:39,811 --> 00:37:41,730
If you want to hear my
favorite letters of all time,

652
00:37:41,731 --> 00:37:44,880
put into compilation the
graveyard book by Neil Gaiman.

653
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:48,270
If you're a nonfiction purist and
you want something to convert you,

654
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:52,830
this is one I've listened to multiple
times and right now if you're curious and

655
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,960
I'm listening to nonviolent communication
by Marshall Rosenberg and you can tell

656
00:37:58,501 --> 00:38:03,390
which one is the correct one because a
peace sign on the cover of the audio book

657
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:06,030
and it's five hours and nine minutes long.

658
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:09,600
This was recommended to me by
Neil Strauss multiple time,

659
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:14,660
New York Times bestselling author and
audible has a lot going for it right now.

660
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,310
Among other things,
this is time sensitive.

661
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:20,940
Amazon prime members can get
audible for just four 95 a month.

662
00:38:20,941 --> 00:38:24,180
That's $4 and 95 cents per month
for the first three months.

663
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:27,900
That's like getting three months for the
price of one and after that it's just

664
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:32,820
1495 per month.

671

Plus your audio books are yours to
keep forever. Even if you cancel.

673
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,980
Audio books are a great psychic,

674
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,780
a great secondary activity for any number
of things you might do this summer,

675
00:39:04,781 --> 00:39:08,290
like hiking, sunbathing, hanging out
on the beach, running, road, tripping,

676
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:10,360
whatever it might be,
hiking outside.

677
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:15,250
I listened to audio books a lot when I'm
going on. Long walks, dog walks, cooking,

678
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:18,070
et cetera. Even working out
in between sets and so on.

679
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:19,840
If you're someone who likes to binge,

680
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:23,830
