00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,500
Hi Guys. Tim Ferriss here. Before we
get started, a quick announcements.

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:08,390
Have you ever wished that you could easily
access the best tips, tricks, tools,

3
00:00:08,391 --> 00:00:12,800
and tactics, all that alliteration from
200 plus guests on the Tim Ferriss show,

4
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:16,640
that's about 600 to 700 hours of audio.
Well now you can,

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,280
and my new book tools
of titans does the job.

6
00:00:20,281 --> 00:00:24,040
It is an inside look at my favorite
advice from the guests on the podcasts,

7
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:26,940
people like Arnold Schwarzenegger who
actually wrote the foreword for the book,

8
00:00:26,941 --> 00:00:30,240
Jamie Foxx, Tony Robbins,
Peter Teal, Amanda Palmer,

9
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:35,040
and so many others and how you can apply
their wisdom to your life and how I've

10
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:39,720
applied all of their advice to
mine is at least 50% new material,

11
00:00:39,721 --> 00:00:43,920
new tips from old guests,
new tips from brand new guests.

12
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,680
I poured my heart into this book.
So if you love the podcast,

13
00:00:46,681 --> 00:00:49,260
you will love tools of titans.
Please check it out.

14
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,020
It helps me continue to do this podcast.

Pick up your copy or just read more
about it@toolsoftitans.com and as always,

16
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:59,190
thank you for listening.

17
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:02,280
Optimal at this altitude,

18
00:01:02,281 --> 00:01:06,890
I can run flat out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking. Question,

19
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:13,960
I'm a cybernetic organism living tissue.

20
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,150
This episode is brought
to you by four sigmatic.

21
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:32,210
I reached out to these innovative Finnish
entrepreneurs of all things because a

22
00:01:32,431 --> 00:01:35,820
very skilled acrobat introduced
me to one of their products,

23
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:40,440
which is a mushroom coffee
made out of Chaga mushroom,

24
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,050
powerful antioxidant,
considered a super food.

25
00:01:43,051 --> 00:01:48,051
I was introduced to Chaga
by Laird Hamilton of all
people and another mushroom

26
00:01:48,091 --> 00:01:49,170
called lion's mane,

27
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:54,290
which is considered a no tropic or a
smart drug and I had half a packet and let

28
00:01:55,141 --> 00:01:58,140
me put this in perspective. Tasted just
like coffee, just add the hot water,

29
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,480
only 20 milligrams in
half a packet of caffeine.

30
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,420
That's it's as little as one 10th what
you'd find in a strong cup of coffee and

31
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,660
I was on fire for the entire day.

32
00:02:09,661 --> 00:02:11,640
I probably got more done in that day.

33
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:16,850
Then I got done in the three or four
days prior to that so I would highly

34
00:02:16,891 --> 00:02:21,210
recommend checking it out. It is very
impressive. You will not see visuals,

00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:46,070
This episode is brought to
you by Wealthfront and this
is a very unique sponsor.

40
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:50,840
Wealthfront is a massively disruptive
in a good way, set it and forget it.

41
00:02:50,841 --> 00:02:55,190
Investing service led by technologists
from places like apple and world famous

42
00:02:55,191 --> 00:02:55,940
investors.

43
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:59,860
It has exploded in popularity in the last
two years and they have more than two

44
00:02:59,861 --> 00:03:02,680
and a half billion dollars
under management. In fact,

45
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,030
some of my very good friends,

46
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,270
investors in silicon valley have millions
of their own money in Wealthfront.

47
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:10,300
So the question is why? Why is
it so popular? Why is it unique?

48
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:14,590
Because you can get services previously
reserved for the ultra wealthy but only

49
00:03:14,591 --> 00:03:16,600
pay pennies on the dollar for them.

50
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,320
And this is because they use smarter
software instead of retail locations,

51
00:03:20,321 --> 00:03:23,050
bloated sales teams, et cetera. And
I'll come back to that in a second.

52
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,210
I suggest you check out wealthfront.com
forward slash Tim take the risk

53
00:03:28,211 --> 00:03:28,961
assessment quiz,

54
00:03:28,961 --> 00:03:32,860
which only takes two to five minutes and
they'll show you for free exactly the

55
00:03:32,861 --> 00:03:35,800
portfolio they'd put you in and if
you just want to take their advice,

56
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:39,190
run with it, do it yourself.
You can do that or as I would,

57
00:03:39,191 --> 00:03:41,080
you can set it and
forget it and here's why.

58
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:45,400
The value of Wealthfront is in the
automation of habits and strategies that

59
00:03:45,401 --> 00:03:48,820
investors should be using on a
regular basis but normally aren't.

60
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,490
Great investing is a marathon,
not a sprint,

61
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:55,150
and little things that you may or may
not be familiar with like automatic tax

62
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:57,310
loss harvesting,
rebalancing your portfolio,

63
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:01,780
cross more than 10 asset classes and
dividend reinvestment add up to very large

64
00:04:01,781 --> 00:04:05,500
amounts of money over longer periods
of time. Wealthfront, as I mentioned,

65
00:04:05,501 --> 00:04:08,110
since it's using software
instead of retail locations,

66
00:04:08,111 --> 00:04:12,280
etc. Can offer all of this at low
costs that were previously completely

67
00:04:12,281 --> 00:04:13,780
impossible right off the bat,

68
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,330
you never pay commissions or
account fees for everything.

69
00:04:16,331 --> 00:04:21,331
They charge 0.25% per year on assets above
the first 15,000 which is managed for

70
00:04:21,971 --> 00:04:25,690
free. If you use my link,
wealthfront.com forward slash Tim,

71
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,790
that is less than $5 a month to invest
a $30,000 account for instance. Now,

72
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:32,440
normally when I have a
sponsor on this show,

73
00:04:32,441 --> 00:04:35,980
it's because I use them and
recommend them. In this case,
it's a little different.

74
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:40,300
I don't use Wealthfront yet because
I'm not allowed to. Here's the deal.

75
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,560
They wanted to sponsor this podcast,
but because of sec regulations,

76
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:48,220
companies that invest your money are
not allowed to use client testimonials.

77
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:51,040
So I couldn't be a user end
have them on the podcast,

78
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:55,150
but I've been so impressed by Wealthfront
that I've invested a significant

79
00:04:55,151 --> 00:04:58,990
amount of my own money, at least for me,
uh, in the team and the company itself.

80
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:02,140
So I am an investor and hope
to soon use it as a client.

81
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,620
Now back to the recommendation
as a Tim Ferriss show listener,

82
00:05:05,621 --> 00:05:09,490
you'll get $15,000 managed for free
if you decide to open an account.

83
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,520
But just start with seeing the portfolio
that they would suggest for you.

84
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:16,720
Take two minutes, fill out their
questionnaire@wealthfront.com
forward slash. Tim.

85
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,840
It's fast. It's free. There's
no downside that I can think of.

86
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:25,900
Little boys and girls, cats
and dogs, lemurs and squirrels.

87
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,480
This is Tim Ferriss and
welcome to another edition,

88
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:32,770
another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show
where it is my job to deconstruct world

89
00:05:32,771 --> 00:05:36,460
class performers from all different
trades, all different specialties,

90
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,700
entertainment, military,
sports, you name it.

91
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:42,550
This episode is by request.

92
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:47,260
Thousands of you have been asking for
an episode on Dog Training and I would

93
00:05:47,261 --> 00:05:48,940
expand that to human training.

94
00:05:48,941 --> 00:05:53,560
How do you condition other people or
yourself to do what it is you want them or

95
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:58,340
you yourself to do.
This episode features Susan Garrett,

96
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:02,390
who is an incredible,
not only dog trainer but competitor.

97
00:06:02,391 --> 00:06:04,880
She has a bachelor's of
science and animal science.

98
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:08,960
She's one of the most consistently
successful competitors in the sport of dog

99
00:06:08,961 --> 00:06:11,960
agility.
For now more than two decades,

100
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:14,540
she's been on the podium of
world and national champion.

101
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,160
Let me try English again.

102
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:21,370
Championship events more than 50 times
winning those events a total of 38 times.

103
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:25,070
She was of great help to me.
When I first adopted Molly,

104
00:06:25,071 --> 00:06:29,420
my own pup and her book
shaping success was voted,

105
00:06:29,421 --> 00:06:33,170
are selected as the 2005 dog training
and behavior book of the year.

106
00:06:33,171 --> 00:06:38,171
She is a champ both for her
competitive track record,

107
00:06:38,211 --> 00:06:43,211
but also in her ability to convey
concrete tips and recommendations for,

108
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:50,210
for instance, the most critical games
and exercises to play with your dog.

109
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,010
The three types of reinforcement,

110
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:56,240
how do you as crates properly what you
should do in the first 24 hours of say,

111
00:06:56,241 --> 00:06:57,080
adopting a puppy.

112
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:02,530
And we talk about just about every facet
of dog training and really the way you

113
00:07:03,591 --> 00:07:07,070
should think of this as behavioral
modification and conditioning.

114
00:07:07,071 --> 00:07:08,450
So the supplies to chickens,

115
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:13,630
it applies to maybe irritating inlaws
the cat that wants stopped sleeping on

116
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:16,310
your kitchen table. I think I borrowed
that from, don't shoot the dog,

117
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,380
but it's all the same thing.

118
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:22,370
So there are principles in this that
you can take away even if you have no

119
00:07:22,371 --> 00:07:25,850
interest in training dog having
a dog or dogs in general.

120
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:30,920
So let's me then allow
Susan to do the talking.

121
00:07:30,921 --> 00:07:35,270
You can find her on the Facebook
and she has a very active page,

122
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:40,480
lots of great pics and videos and that
is very simply facebook.com forward slash

123
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:45,470
Susan Garret, g a r r e t t,
Susan Garrett dog agility.

124
00:07:45,471 --> 00:07:47,960
So facebook.com forward slash
Susan Garrett dog agility.

125
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:52,990
Say Hi to her and I hope you enjoy
this conversation as much as I did.

126
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,900
Susan, welcome to the show.
Thanks Sam. Happy to be here.

127
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:03,500
I have wanted to get you on
the show for quite a while now.

128
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,360
After our first conversation,

129
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:10,810
I knew that we would eventually meet
again with recorded audio because my

130
00:08:10,881 --> 00:08:15,881
audience has been asking me for an
episode on dog training and so on for ages

131
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:19,950
since I got Molly and
you and I spoke very,

132
00:08:19,951 --> 00:08:24,930
very early on in that process for
me. Uh, the right when I was not,

133
00:08:24,931 --> 00:08:25,910
I wouldn't say flatlining,

134
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:30,980
but kind of before I hockey sticked
in my training education and uh,

135
00:08:31,351 --> 00:08:34,470
so I could think of no
better person to have on.

136
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:39,590
And a part of what appealed to me was
the fact that you have an objective and

137
00:08:43,441 --> 00:08:46,320
verifiable record.
And what I mean by that,

138
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:49,170
and for those people who are
wondering how I seek out experts,

139
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:53,730
part of it is finding people who
can be evaluated objectively.

140
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:58,380
It's not their opinion, not someone
else's qualitative opinion. Uh,

141
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:01,440
you now I'm just going to
read a little bit of your bio.

142
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:02,820
I won't go into a ton of it,

143
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,110
but you are one of the most consistently
successful competitors in the sport of

144
00:09:07,111 --> 00:09:09,730
dog agility over the past,
uh,

145
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,010
I guess at least two decades you've
been on the podium of world national

146
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:17,180
championship events more than 50 times
winning those events. A total of 38 times.

147
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,940
I was, I was hoping perhaps we
could start since most folks, well,

148
00:09:21,941 --> 00:09:25,540
I shouldn't say most, but many folks
are not familiar with dog sports.

149
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:29,450
What is dog agility? What does,
what does that support look like?

150
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:32,870
Most people would have seen it
but maybe didn't know what it was.

151
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:38,330
We used to have a event on ESPN
a lot every year. So it's the,

152
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:41,630
it's a sport where the dogs go over the
Johnson through the tunnels and they

153
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:45,980
wave and out of the poles and it's
a really fast, fast sport. It's,

154
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,470
it's really gotten to a place where it's,
you know,

155
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:52,610
it's tough to keep up unless you're really
great shape as a handler that it's a

156
00:09:52,611 --> 00:09:54,200
lot of convertibles,
dog and handler.

157
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:58,780
And what are some of the ways
in which that is scored? How,

158
00:09:58,781 --> 00:10:01,830
how has that scored,
and I think we talked at one point,

159
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,990
maybe you and I talked
about this false starts.

160
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,990
Is that a big part of the or is
that a piece of the equation?

161
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:12,390
No, not in, in uh, agility. It definitely
isn't pliable, which is another sport.

162
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:16,890
I actually won world championships in
as well before I really got heavily

163
00:10:16,891 --> 00:10:21,180
involved in and agility. Agility
is scored. Think of it like a,

164
00:10:21,181 --> 00:10:24,810
if you watch a horse jumping competition,
not the Olympics at time is number one.

165
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:29,940
Um, but it has to be time with a clean
round. So there isn't style points.

166
00:10:29,941 --> 00:10:31,010
It's just,
you know,

167
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:34,500
getting around over all the obstacles as
fast as you can without having a fault.

168
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:38,010
Hmm. And, uh, what,

169
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:43,400
what separates a good handler
from a great handler in,

170
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:49,410
let's just say for now, talking
about the, uh, the sport component?

171
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:54,540
Well, like any sport, the number one thing
that separates us is the mental game.

172
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:59,690
And once you take, put that
aside, it would be, um, the,

173
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:03,870
the DA, the handlers ability
to train their dog or,

174
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:07,470
and you can put an end or the
handlers ability to outrun their dog.

175
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:12,720
And most of my competition are in their
mid twenties and at the way the world

176
00:11:12,721 --> 00:11:16,320
championship level.
So they are able to outrun their dog.

177
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:20,220
In my mid fifties. I am not,
uh, able to outrun any dog,

178
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:24,450
so I rely more on the dog training
aspect of it to be successful.

179
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:30,500
And what would you say differentiates
your approach to training compared to

180
00:11:31,321 --> 00:11:32,450
others?
Uh,

181
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:37,290
for those people who have maybe only
seen a handful of like network TV shows

182
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,360
with celebrity dog trainers and so on.

183
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,540
I train,
I train dogs very much the way they did.

184
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:48,650
They trained marine mammals
or exotic animals. It's,

185
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,050
it's a reinforcement based program.

186
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,220
Think of it like a killer rally
can't get in the tank and,

187
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,240
and correct them and you know, beat the
crap out of them when they're wrong.

188
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:00,250
Right. To hit it with a
rolled up newspaper. Exactly.

189
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:03,500
So it's choice based dog training in,

190
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:07,040
in with the focus on reinforcement.
It's um,

191
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:11,740
it incredibly successful and that's
why, you know, when I raise a dog,

192
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:17,010
my focus is to have a phenomenal family
pet first and then I know that lays the

193
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:22,950
foundation to be a world champion later
and it's all done through, you know,

194
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,620
being intentional and
purposeful with what I want and,

195
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:29,950
and creating basically the dog of my
dreams every time I get a new puppy.

196
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:36,400
When you say what does that mean?
Choice based training?

197
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,770
There's basically, you know, if I,

198
00:12:38,771 --> 00:12:41,320
if I was going to lump
training into three categories,

199
00:12:41,321 --> 00:12:43,060
there would be punishment based,

200
00:12:43,061 --> 00:12:47,560
which is more traditional because in the
military that's the way animals we're

201
00:12:47,561 --> 00:12:51,700
often trained with. Um, you know, you're
the master and they will do it. They're,

202
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:54,910
they're told and there's really
no very little reinforcement.

203
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:58,000
It's the absence of punishment
that makes the dog keep working.

204
00:12:58,001 --> 00:13:01,630
And it's the brilliance of dogs that
allows them to still have this great bond

205
00:13:01,631 --> 00:13:05,650
with us in spite of what went on with
punishment based training and still goes

206
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:07,930
on because it's,
it's certainly not gone.

207
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:11,800
And then there's reinforcement based
training where people put a cookie on the

208
00:13:11,801 --> 00:13:16,660
dog's nose and lower them to do, to
get what they want from them. And uh,

209
00:13:16,661 --> 00:13:19,800
and that certainly is a step up
from punishment in that you're,

210
00:13:19,801 --> 00:13:23,230
you're creating a relationship
of fun and trust. Uh,

211
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:28,180
it has its limitations on its
success once that lure is gone. And,

212
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,360
and then what we do is, is, uh,

213
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:33,710
different from that because we
definitely use food and toys and,

214
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:36,100
and anything the dog
loves as a reinforcement.

215
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:40,830
But it's only after the dog has made a
choice. So they make a choice and the,

216
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:43,240
you know, it's, it's like
consequence basically. You know,

217
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:47,320
I come from a family of nine kids and so,

218
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,410
and I never ever heard my
parents raised their voice.

219
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:52,570
So how you have success with that?

220
00:13:52,571 --> 00:13:56,560
And this was really how I train my
first dog as I just modeled my mother.

221
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,160
And if we were upstairs watching
Disney and it was, you know,

222
00:14:00,161 --> 00:14:02,170
five to six and they called us for supper,

223
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:05,620
they didn't yell and stamp their
feet and you know, carry on.

224
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:08,710
They would give us a chance to make
a choice. Are you coming for supper?

225
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,680
And if you,
if you choose not to come down for supper,

226
00:14:11,681 --> 00:14:13,390
then she would go into the basement,

227
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:18,850
unscrew the fuse for the TV and there'd
be no TV for the rest of the night and

228
00:14:18,851 --> 00:14:19,900
for the next 24 hours.

229
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:23,500
So you have the choice to either
do as you're asked or not.

230
00:14:23,501 --> 00:14:27,100
And you live by the consequences of that
choice. And that's pretty much, you know,

231
00:14:27,101 --> 00:14:28,680
how we raise the dogs.

232
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:32,530
You create an environment
rich and reinforcement so
that the correct choice when

233
00:14:32,531 --> 00:14:35,530
you want them to make is the
one they end up wanting to make.

234
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,770
But if they choose something
that isn't what you want,

235
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:43,630
the environment controls the consequences
so that you don't have to punish them

236
00:14:43,631 --> 00:14:48,631
or beat up or the rolled up
newspaper would be a good example.

237
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:53,210
Dog Training. I mean, and the

238
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:58,150
story of the TV brings to mind a
video I watched of you actually, uh,

239
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:03,170
believe it was helping to train a woman's
dog with leave it and covering the

240
00:15:04,861 --> 00:15:07,470
food. I think you were covering
the food with your hand.

241
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:10,500
Could you explain if that's a good
example? I don't know if it is,

242
00:15:10,501 --> 00:15:12,300
but could you explain how that works?

243
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:16,400
Yeah, that's one of our
foundational games. So we have
four games. We tell people,

244
00:15:16,401 --> 00:15:19,490
you know, you can rock it with your
dog if you get these four games in.

245
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:22,970
And the first one is the one you
described, it's called, it's your choice.

246
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:26,900
That's why I created my own word. And
it's just one word. It's your choice.

247
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:31,850
And we want the dogs to know you're
in control of all the good things that

248
00:15:31,851 --> 00:15:33,340
happen in your life.
And,

249
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,640
and it's just a response
cost of me closing my hand
around the food. So, you know,

250
00:15:37,641 --> 00:15:41,720
you get a handful of really attractive
traits and depending on the dog's food

251
00:15:41,721 --> 00:15:43,700
drive, like if it was, uh, you know,

252
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:46,970
a sight hound dog that doesn't have a
ton of food drive, I might get like,

253
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:49,790
you know, the, the top level value food,

254
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:52,750
I could get steak and cheese and put
that in my hand. And if it was a,

255
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:56,540
a Chow Hound, you know, like a Labrador,

256
00:15:56,541 --> 00:16:00,560
they just love food or a Sheltie you
could put cable in your hand and the dog's

257
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:03,700
gonna like Paul and bite
and bark and go crazy.

258
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:06,820
They're going to be on a leash so that
they don't have access to just go find

259
00:16:06,821 --> 00:16:10,900
something else to do. But as soon as
they stop all that, you open your hand.

260
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:11,861
It's your choice.

261
00:16:11,861 --> 00:16:16,861
So your choice was to stop unwanted
behavior and my choice was to open my hand

262
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:20,490
and then the dog says, Hey, party
on, I'm going to dive into the food.

263
00:16:20,491 --> 00:16:23,430
Well I didn't like that choice,
so I'm going to close my hand.

264
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:27,630
And this goes back and forth like a
tennis match until the dogs choice is just

265
00:16:27,631 --> 00:16:30,150
to sit back and stare at
the hand when it's open.

266
00:16:30,151 --> 00:16:31,860
And then I pick up a
cookie and I feed them.

267
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:36,430
And that's the first communication
that's clear to that dog.

268
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:41,790
I am in control of the good things in
my life because if I do what this person

269
00:16:42,221 --> 00:16:43,930
wants,
good things happen.

270
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:48,610
And that's the premise for absolutely
everything we do. Whether, you know,

271
00:16:48,611 --> 00:16:53,611
I have students who train animals at the
Toronto Zoo and it's exactly the same

272
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:55,590
premise that you,

273
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:00,800
you control access to the reinforcement
and then you reward good choices by

274
00:17:01,051 --> 00:17:02,610
giving access to reinforcement.

275
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,400
And the thing is with dog owners
and they don't realize, you know,

276
00:17:05,401 --> 00:17:06,900
when we think about reinforcement,
they think,

277
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:10,800
well I've got to go cut up some cheese
because I'm training my dog. But there,

278
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:12,150
there's really, you know, there's,

279
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:16,140
there's three really big reinforcements
for our dogs. It's the food is obvious.

280
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:20,160
Toys you throw a ball or a Frisbee,
that's obvious, but it's the hidden ones,

281
00:17:20,161 --> 00:17:24,000
the ones that aren't so obvious. Those
are the ones that get people into trouble.

282
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,690
So it's permission to do things.

283
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:32,030
So if you're going to the park and
your dogs pulling you on a leash and,

284
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,870
and they're chasing a squirrel
and you and you like, okay,

285
00:17:34,871 --> 00:17:37,290
I got to get rid of this, I'm going
to have to take the leash off. So,

286
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:40,300
and the dog gets his massive reward
of getting to chase a squirrel.

287
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,640
But what you've just
done with the permission,

288
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:47,100
you've rewarded what behavior you don't
want. Exactly. Pulling on a leash.

289
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:51,030
So that goes all day long.
And it's,

290
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:53,580
and it's when you have an awakening too,

291
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:56,130
where's w we told our
students where's the value?

292
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,950
Where's the value for the dog right now?

293
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:02,910
And if you'd have an unwanted behavior,
like pulling on leash, you've got to say,

294
00:18:02,911 --> 00:18:05,700
okay, here's what I want.
Let's just get clear.

295
00:18:05,701 --> 00:18:08,370
This is be real intentional
about this is what I want,

296
00:18:08,371 --> 00:18:11,040
this is what it's going to look like.
This is what I've got.

297
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,000
So what's between there is a
gap of what I have to train.

298
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:19,110
And the first thing to identify is where's
the value for the dog? Because dogs,

299
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,490
they just do what's reinforcing.

300
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:25,830
And you just identify where
that reinforcement is and
start to control it in a

301
00:18:25,831 --> 00:18:28,320
way that you give them
permission for what they want.

302
00:18:28,321 --> 00:18:31,020
So when we go back to that
dog pulling on a leash,

303
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:36,050
you might stand still until the dog came
in beside you and then praise them so

304
00:18:36,051 --> 00:18:41,030
that they connect, oh, my action gave
me the access to be free and chase.

305
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,920
So you make that connection that all the
value comes through you and you become

306
00:18:45,921 --> 00:18:48,140
part of the process instead of the dog.

307
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:51,950
And the squirrel being the only two people
in the process for two animals in the

308
00:18:51,951 --> 00:18:52,590
process.

309
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:56,140
And uh, this is, I'm, it's,

310
00:18:56,250 --> 00:19:00,500
it's been a little bit since I was digging
really deep in a lot of these videos,

311
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:04,610
which were fantastic. But
is that a, do you call it,

312
00:19:04,611 --> 00:19:08,120
I think in this particular
case, the sort of, um,

313
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:12,240
common heel position, like the dog to
your left and then the reward zone,

314
00:19:12,241 --> 00:19:13,074
is that the right,
right,

315
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:17,480
exactly. Reinforcement zone over reward
zone. And if that's what you think of it,

316
00:19:17,481 --> 00:19:21,470
that all good things in life
happen right there. And again,

317
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:24,440
pulling on leash is such a pain
in the butt for so many people,

318
00:19:24,441 --> 00:19:26,090
but they don't realize that.
