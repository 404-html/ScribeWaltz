1
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,430
Katie, welcome. Come to the show.
Thank you very much. This is fun.

2
00:00:15,431 --> 00:00:19,900
And I liked the setup then I liked the
view, the view of Beautiful Austin,

3
00:00:19,901 --> 00:00:23,130
Texas. Yeah, it's really
been fun. Actually.

4
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,510
This is my first south by southwest.

5
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:31,150
I know people call it south by, I want
to make it even cooler and call it sp.

6
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,070
Um,

7
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:37,360
but it's been really fun to be here and
it's been a really interesting for me.

8
00:00:37,361 --> 00:00:39,190
So thank you for having me on the show.

9
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,620
Of course. I really appreciate you
making the time and I'll be honest,

10
00:00:43,621 --> 00:00:45,330
I feel a little bit like that,

11
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,510
that Petulant Luke Skywalker and the
first star wars, everyone's like, oh,

12
00:00:48,511 --> 00:00:53,511
come on when he's hanging out with Obi
wan and just missing the point because

13
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:57,990
I'm sitting here asking questions of
someone who's asked more questions of more

14
00:00:57,991 --> 00:01:02,430
presidents and dignitaries than I'll
ever even have a chance to meet.

15
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,380
So I apologize in advance if I make any

16
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:05,620
not mistakes.

17
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:11,280
I think that if you just are curious
about people and your curiosity is genuine

18
00:01:11,921 --> 00:01:15,120
and you're truly interested in someone,
uh,

19
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:19,780
I think any that that's really
what makes a good interviewer.

20
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,740
And so I am very happy that in state.
So I think it'll be fine.

21
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:29,240
I want to jump in to something that I
found in the course of doing my homework

22
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,720
that led me to a number of
different questions and I said if,

23
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,820
if I would ever have the chance to
ask him, I was like, wait a second.

24
00:01:34,821 --> 00:01:35,780
I do have a chance to ask.

25
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:41,290
So this was something I found via NPR
and as an interview format and they were

26
00:01:41,481 --> 00:01:45,560
asking you if there was any story that
made your reputation or if there was a

27
00:01:45,561 --> 00:01:49,880
moment like that. And again, the Internet
sometimes misquotes things. So I'll,

28
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,680
you can correct if need be,

29
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:55,910
but I'll read a little bit and then
I want to ask follow up questions.

30
00:01:55,911 --> 00:01:58,910
So I think I got noticed when I was doing
a tour of the White House and Barbara

31
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,800
Bush. I didn't think that
President Bush was there.

32
00:02:00,801 --> 00:02:04,580
And suddenly I heard this cocker Spaniel
or Springer Spaniel ultimately ends up,

33
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,390
we arrive at Milly that smelly coming
into the room and President Bush was

34
00:02:08,391 --> 00:02:10,940
following him and suddenly I had to do
an interview with the president of the

35
00:02:10,941 --> 00:02:12,710
United States that I
wasn't prepared to do.

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,540
I was just getting a
tour of the White House.

37
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:17,330
So that was sort of where I found
my career path before my eyes.

38
00:02:17,331 --> 00:02:20,060
But I was able to come up with enough
questions to keep them there for something

39
00:02:20,061 --> 00:02:23,750
like 19 minutes and 20 seconds. So that
last sentence was the part was like, okay,

40
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:29,540
I have to ask you, if you could just
walk us through that and how on earth,

41
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:31,520
what,
do you recall any of the questions?

42
00:02:31,521 --> 00:02:34,670
Do you recall how you kept the president

43
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,220
on the hook so to speak? Yeah. Or,

44
00:02:38,221 --> 00:02:41,540
or just any recollections
from that because it's,

45
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:44,000
it's just conjure is such an
incredible image in my mind.

46
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,450
Well, you can imagine, you know,

47
00:02:45,451 --> 00:02:48,960
when you've prepared for an interview
and something completely unexpected

48
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:49,681
happens.

49
00:02:49,681 --> 00:02:54,681
So I had prepared endlessly to talk
to Barbara Bush about the White House.

50
00:02:55,171 --> 00:02:57,090
It was the anniversary of the White House.

51
00:02:57,091 --> 00:03:00,960
And she was giving me a tour and we
were going to be talking about Dolly

52
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:05,920
Madison's tea set and we were going
to talk about the ball and claw, uh,

53
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:11,040
legs on some of the chairs and all kinds
of things and paintings and deaths and

54
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:16,180
accoutrements that are part
and parcel of the White House.

55
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:20,170
And suddenly as you described it was like,

56
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:24,040
and I was like, Oh God,
Oh God, what's going on?

57
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:29,041
And I for some reason thought
that President Bush was
out of town or that he had

58
00:03:29,321 --> 00:03:32,800
an appointment and that he
wasn't going to be around.

59
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:38,460
And it's not often that you have the
president of pop in to say hi and you have

60
00:03:39,941 --> 00:03:44,740
no questions for him. So you just had it.
That was where the rubber met the road.

61
00:03:44,741 --> 00:03:47,320
And I just had to pull all
these questions, you know,

62
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,550
pretty much out of my ass to
ask the president, you know,

63
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,680
the most powerful man in the free world.

64
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:58,870
So I think I asked him about Iran Contra,
I asked him about,

65
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:02,740
he was running against Bill Clinton.
So I asked him about that campaign.

66
00:04:02,741 --> 00:04:05,720
I'd like to rewatch that actually to,

67
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:10,690
to see how it plays out
today and what I remember.

68
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,270
But I just kept on firing away.

69
00:04:13,271 --> 00:04:18,271
And I remember his upper lip started
kind of quivering because I think he too

70
00:04:20,141 --> 00:04:24,370
felt suddenly put on the spot.
He wasn't prepared either.

71
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,233
Exactly.

72
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:30,270
And we just had this very intense
kind of ratatat tat back and forth.

73
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:35,410
And finally, I remember Marlin Fitzwater
came in and I said, oh my gosh,

74
00:04:35,411 --> 00:04:39,250
here's Marlon. And I think Mrs. Bush,
everyone was basically saying, okay,

75
00:04:39,251 --> 00:04:40,720
that's enough.
Enough is enough.

76
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,350
And I remember saying to
the audience at the time,

77
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:49,210
the viewers that Marlin Fitzwater was
pulling out whatever was left of his hair

78
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:54,430
because he was pretty bald at the time.
And, uh, yeah, that was, that was,

79
00:04:54,431 --> 00:04:56,270
uh, that was, uh,

80
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,340
a very kind of intense situation for me.

81
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:04,330
But it also showed that I could
think on my feet. Now I'm fairness.

82
00:05:04,331 --> 00:05:08,650
I also had my executive producer just
sucker peppering me with questions behind

83
00:05:08,651 --> 00:05:13,180
the scenes through my IFB. I
think he was nervous, yeah.

84
00:05:13,181 --> 00:05:17,470
That if I had had a moment and suddenly
had nothing to say that he was going to

85
00:05:17,471 --> 00:05:18,280
leave.

86
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,850
And of course is somebody who really
understands television and understands

87
00:05:21,851 --> 00:05:26,290
audiences. He wanted to keep the
president on the hook as long as he could.

88
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:31,780
Yeah. So, uh, but it was fun.
And I remember afterwards
thinking, Oh my God. And,

89
00:05:31,781 --> 00:05:33,340
and it was well received,

90
00:05:33,341 --> 00:05:37,540
I think a Tom Shales who's the TV critic
for the Washington Post for a very

91
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:41,710
flattering article following that. But
that was, I think, very important because,

92
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,730
you know, when I did that job and
I decided I would be the co-anchor,

93
00:05:45,731 --> 00:05:46,421
the today show,

94
00:05:46,421 --> 00:05:50,740
it was really important for me as a female
in the business to be taken seriously

95
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:54,580
and to not be relegated to the cooking
and fashion segments. And in fact,

96
00:05:54,581 --> 00:05:57,770
when I got offered the job,
I said to Michael Gardner,

97
00:05:57,771 --> 00:05:59,510
the then president of NBC News,

98
00:05:59,511 --> 00:06:03,950
I'll only do it if it's a 50 50 division
of labor between me and Brian Gumbel.

99
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:08,000
And I said, I, I, I had
covered the Pentagon.

100
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:12,740
I hated worked very hard and local news
and I'd gotten some very good advice

101
00:06:12,741 --> 00:06:17,120
early in my career to not be typecast
as the cute girl who does features.

102
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,920
So,
you know,

103
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:23,930
it was important and that was
validation in a way that yes,

104
00:06:23,931 --> 00:06:26,450
I could have a fun personality,

105
00:06:26,451 --> 00:06:29,600
but I could really get serious
and s serious questions,

106
00:06:29,601 --> 00:06:32,990
penetrating questions when I needed to,
even if I wasn't prepared.

107
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,511
I mean,
I,

108
00:06:35,511 --> 00:06:38,550
I want to ask you about the sort of
the Chutzpah and where that comes from,

109
00:06:38,551 --> 00:06:43,260
but is that a trained skill?
Is that something innate to you?

110
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:48,090
How did you end up developing that level
of aggression is too strong a word,

111
00:06:48,091 --> 00:06:51,660
but that ability to capitalize
on an opportunity like that

112
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:59,890
to say, I had a lot of Moxie, which I
love that word is a good word. Yeah. And,

113
00:06:59,891 --> 00:07:03,520
uh, you know, I don't know. I think
it's inherent in my personality.

114
00:07:03,521 --> 00:07:06,850
I think I have been
pretty guileless if that,

115
00:07:06,851 --> 00:07:10,570
if that's kind of a synonym
for moxy in a way. I mean,

116
00:07:10,571 --> 00:07:15,571
I think I've always been
pretty uninhibited and very
open and very willing to go

117
00:07:16,121 --> 00:07:19,810
there wherever there might be. And, uh,

118
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:24,550
I think I've always had a fair
amount of confidence in myself,

119
00:07:24,551 --> 00:07:29,350
although it's wavered, you know, from
time to time through the years. But um,

120
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,520
yeah,
I think,

121
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:35,830
I think having super supportive parents
obviously probably fed into that. Um,

122
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:41,020
but I also think it's a little bit in
my DNA as well. A little hard word.

123
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:43,900
Yeah, I do. I actually do. And, uh,

124
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:49,630
it's sort of always fairly fearless and
not hesitant to be out front and running

125
00:07:51,341 --> 00:07:55,000
for vice president when I was in fifth
grade and president of my elementary

126
00:07:55,001 --> 00:07:59,410
school when I was in sixth grade and one
it always wanted to be a student leader

127
00:07:59,411 --> 00:08:03,070
in that kind of thing.
Very Tracey flick from election.

128
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:03,970
Would you like a piece of gum?

129
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:07,100
Did you remember that movie?
Did you see that with Reese Witherspoon?

130
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:08,940
It's actually right.

131
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:13,050
Very, very funny movie. It kills me.
But, um, I'm not too Tracy flick ish,

132
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,510
but a little and um,
so,

133
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,480
so I think I just have
always had had the Chutzpah.

134
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:20,951
All right.

135
00:08:20,951 --> 00:08:25,030
So I have you have forgotten more
interviews than I'll probably ever do,

136
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:28,180
but even in my short
stint doing a podcast,

137
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:32,460
we're just around 300 right
now. Wow. That's a lot.

138
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,200
It's a decent number. I mean,
I'm getting you do it every week.

139
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,900
I publish on average six a
month, six a month, six months.

140
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:43,350
So there, what is your
publishing schedule? Uh,

141
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:46,360
the publishing schedule
is two weeks per month.

142
00:08:46,361 --> 00:08:49,270
We'll have two episodes and two per month.
We'll have a single episode.

143
00:08:49,271 --> 00:08:53,200
I'm thinking of reducing that down
to once per week, but I record them.

144
00:08:53,201 --> 00:08:56,520
I typically record them in batches
and then schedule them out in advance,

145
00:08:56,521 --> 00:08:58,830
particularly if they're more
complex involving video.

146
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,070
So,
um,

147
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:05,130
do you find that sometimes they're not
topical because you don't do them around

148
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:05,870
the

149
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,230
publish?
Good question.

150
00:09:07,231 --> 00:09:12,080
So I deliberately avoid
topical subjects and uh,

151
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:15,560
this is smart, I guess. So they can
be evergreen. That's right. And this,

152
00:09:15,561 --> 00:09:16,610
there are trade offs though.

153
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:20,630
So there are people who I've
watched very closely who are in my,

154
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:23,870
let's call it peer group in the,
in the podcasting world who are very,

155
00:09:23,871 --> 00:09:28,100
very good at tracking the headlines,
finding names,

156
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:32,630
inviting those people on and riding the
wave of Google juice effectively the,

157
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:37,070
the trend in traffic and search queries
to drive traffic to their podcasts.

158
00:09:37,071 --> 00:09:38,240
That's very,
very effective.

159
00:09:38,241 --> 00:09:42,830
But I don't want content if
I get hit by a bus tomorrow.

160
00:09:42,831 --> 00:09:44,530
And I've been very,
uh,

161
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:46,970
I shouldn't say I've been unfortunate
and I think it's part of life,

162
00:09:46,971 --> 00:09:51,971
but I've had a number of
very close friends and also
family members pass away in

163
00:09:52,131 --> 00:09:53,210
the last,
say 12 months.

164
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:58,240
And it just reminds me that I could get
hit by a bus tomorrow and I don't want

165
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:03,830
to have put out only subject
matter that has an expiration date.

166
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:08,390
I really want it to last. So whether
it's a blog post or an interview,

167
00:10:08,391 --> 00:10:09,770
I'd love for there at least,

168
00:10:09,771 --> 00:10:14,771
even if there are topical components to
be themes and lessons that transcend a

169
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:17,000
certain period of time.

170
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:22,540
And that actually leads me to my question,

171
00:10:23,061 --> 00:10:26,930
which is even in my relatively short
stent. Nice segue. Thank you. Thank you.

172
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:29,001
No,

173
00:10:29,001 --> 00:10:34,001
it's true though because what I'm dying
to ask you is related to nervousness.

174
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:39,850
I've had a number of interviews
and episodes where I've
really been nervous for

175
00:10:40,671 --> 00:10:45,671
different reasons and that has led me
to prepare in different ways and respond

176
00:10:46,701 --> 00:10:47,301
in different ways.

177
00:10:47,301 --> 00:10:50,240
Are there any interviews that come to
mind over your career that you were

178
00:10:50,241 --> 00:10:54,440
particularly nervous about beforehand?

179
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:59,150
Yeah, I mean, I think throughout
my career, obviously dignitaries,

180
00:10:59,151 --> 00:11:02,660
heads of state.
I remember I interviewed Yasser Arafat.

181
00:11:02,661 --> 00:11:04,430
I was very nervous about that.

182
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:09,460
Ross Perot was very pugnacious and kind
of ornery and you never knew what he was

183
00:11:10,611 --> 00:11:14,960
going to do. I think, you
know, live interviews are
really scary. Yeah, for sure.

184
00:11:14,961 --> 00:11:18,680
Because you can't, you
know, edit things out.

185
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:23,950
You can't ask a question over again in
a more eloquent way and you're really on

186
00:11:24,411 --> 00:11:28,940
the spot. So I think live
interviews would make me nervous.

187
00:11:28,941 --> 00:11:32,930
I remember I was supposed to interview
with Tom Brokaw. Dot. Oj Simpson,

188
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,160
uh,

189
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:39,160
after he was acquitted and I was a
nervous wreck at the very thought of it

190
00:11:42,651 --> 00:11:47,060
because I thought, first of
all, I'm not a prosecutor.

191
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:52,010
I,
my husband who had passed away later,

192
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:56,230
but who was alive covering a lot
of the Oj trial, knew everything.

193
00:11:56,231 --> 00:11:59,860
He was a criminal defense, white
collar, criminal defense lawyer.

194
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:04,870
And I just remember thinking that
this is just a no win situation.

195
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,570
First of all,
I can't retry the case,

196
00:12:07,571 --> 00:12:11,770
nor could I cause I don't really have
the talent or the skills to do that.

197
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:12,881
And secondly,

198
00:12:12,881 --> 00:12:17,530
it was so divisive and
polarizing that whole situation.

199
00:12:17,531 --> 00:12:22,531
And so racially charged and I at the
time and still do to a certain extent,

200
00:12:23,891 --> 00:12:26,140
just hated like people attacking me.

201
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:30,190
And I thought it was just a no
win situation. So when he bailed,

202
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:34,270
I wanted to do a happy dance.
I was so excited. So, you know,

203
00:12:34,271 --> 00:12:39,271
situations like that would
make me extremely nervous
when I saw so much risk and

204
00:12:39,461 --> 00:12:43,510
so much downside and very
little upside. Right. Um, but,

205
00:12:43,511 --> 00:12:46,600
but I think whenever I'm
interviewing people who are

206
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:53,050
really smart and really knowledgeable
about a certain area and I don't know

207
00:12:53,051 --> 00:12:57,070
nearly as much as they do,
that can be a hard,

208
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:02,130
and I think also when you're interviewing
somebody about a wide range of public

209
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:07,480
policy and you're not,
you're not necessarily a policy wonk,

210
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:09,610
that's challenging too,
but you know,

211
00:13:09,611 --> 00:13:14,170
to go to the White House and interview
a president either live or even on tape

212
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,150
is really stressful.

213
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:21,150
Interviewing Sarah Palin
when I interviewed her
because I thought it was so

214
00:13:21,881 --> 00:13:26,770
important to strike the right tone,
asked the right questions and, uh,

215
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,360
it was a very critical time,

216
00:13:28,361 --> 00:13:33,310
I think to understand her motivations
and actually her abilities.

217
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:37,930
So, um, I still get nervous
when I have big interviews.

218
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:42,460
In the case of, let's take Pailin as an
example. How did you prepare for that?

219
00:13:42,461 --> 00:13:46,330
Can you walk us through some of
your preparation? Well, I think, um,

220
00:13:46,331 --> 00:13:50,590
I worked with my friend Brian
Goldsmith with whom I do a podcast.

221
00:13:50,591 --> 00:13:54,040
He sort of my partner in crime
on the podcast. He's a very,

222
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:59,041
very smart person who really follows
politics and public policy very closely.

223
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:06,840
And we worked together at CVS and when
I found out she was going to do the

224
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:08,231
interview,

225
00:14:08,231 --> 00:14:13,231
we just immediately started to read
everything we possibly could about her,

226
00:14:13,931 --> 00:14:17,320
about Alaska, about um, you know,

227
00:14:17,321 --> 00:14:20,350
everything that was Germane to that,

228
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,920
the presidential campaign,
what was going on in the country.

229
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,910
I called Madeline Albright, I called
Sam Nunn. I called Richard Haas,

230
00:14:27,911 --> 00:14:32,440
who's the head of the council on foreign
relations. I called people and I said,

231
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:35,010
Hey,
I'm interviewing governor Palin.

232
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:39,970
Of course everyone knew was in tune
with what was going on in the campaign.

233
00:14:39,971 --> 00:14:40,990
And I'd say to them,

234
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:46,020
what do you think are some of the areas
that you think are really important that

235
00:14:46,091 --> 00:14:50,830
the American people need to know
about and hear her perspective on?

236
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:53,300
Um,
so I would ask people,

237
00:14:53,301 --> 00:14:57,350
I think I asked a few other
correspondence about it. Um,

238
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,630
read a lot and you know,

239
00:14:59,631 --> 00:15:03,770
you also have to make some very difficult
choices because as you know, you know,

240
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:06,320
they're probably a lot more
questions than you have time for it.

241
00:15:06,321 --> 00:15:07,730
Then your guest has time for.

242
00:15:07,731 --> 00:15:12,731
So then we'd had had to
winnow them down and um,

243
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:17,090
but it was also really
important for me to,

244
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:20,630
uh, you know, make sure my tone was right,

245
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:23,450
that my approach was right.
That I,

246
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:28,190
I remember going in and saying I would
have an almost parkinsonian effect with

247
00:15:28,191 --> 00:15:32,810
very little facial expressions.
I didn't want people to misinterpret that.

248
00:15:32,811 --> 00:15:37,640
I was looking at her like,
what are askance? And uh,

249
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:43,190
and, and Madeleine Albright offered me, I
think the best piece of advice, she said,

250
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:47,930
just let her talk.
And I think so often in conversations,

251
00:15:47,931 --> 00:15:51,110
I don't know if you find this true in
a podcast because it may be different

252
00:15:51,111 --> 00:15:52,550
since things can be edited,

253
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:57,940
but you try to fill the empty spaces
and people feel very uncomfortable with

254
00:15:58,251 --> 00:15:59,150
silence.

255
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:04,070
And I know I do because I want to make
sure that I keep the conversation going.

256
00:16:04,071 --> 00:16:08,410
And then of course, in live television
you can't have these, you know,

257
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:11,360
that dead air.
But I,

258
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:15,920
I really took that advice to
heart and I wouldn't jump in.

259
00:16:15,921 --> 00:16:20,570
I wouldn't jump into rescue her if
she was giving a convoluted answer.

260
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:24,170
I wouldn't jump in if she felt awkward.
I wouldn't jump in if she paused.

261
00:16:24,171 --> 00:16:27,590
I just let her talk and didn't.

262
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,690
And I really resisted that temptation,

263
00:16:29,691 --> 00:16:33,440
which I have because I'm a pleaser
and I want to make sure people feel

264
00:16:33,441 --> 00:16:35,090
comfortable.
Um,

265
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,120
so we spent probably three solid days
preparing for that interview and I really

266
00:16:42,171 --> 00:16:45,860
wanted to ask questions that required
accumulated knowledge and critical

267
00:16:45,861 --> 00:16:50,660
thinking. So I wanted to talk
about big issues and you know,

268
00:16:50,661 --> 00:16:53,420
honestly I look at some of
those questions and I'd say,

269
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:58,100
I don't know how I would answer that,
but I'm also not a public policy expert.

270
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:02,420
Um, but I tried to ask questions
that weren't Gotcha questions,

271
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:04,340
even though she insisted they were,

272
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:09,730
but that people deserve to know a how
much she knew about any given subject and

273
00:17:11,721 --> 00:17:14,810
how she would approach it
and what her thinking was.

274
00:17:14,811 --> 00:17:19,811
And what became abundantly clear is
she just wasn't ready to be put in this

275
00:17:20,781 --> 00:17:21,614
position.

276
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:26,540
She wasn't ready for prime time and
it had nothing to do with her gender.

277
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:31,840
I just think her experience and her
perhaps lack of intellectual curiosity,

278
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,960
did not equip her to do an interview about
substantive issues facing the country

279
00:17:38,841 --> 00:17:42,950
or the world.
Let her talk.

280
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:49,500
I really loved that. I
got, I've had the chance to

281
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,870
become friends with someone in cal Fussman
who was one of the senior writers who

282
00:17:54,871 --> 00:17:55,381
worked on the,

283
00:17:55,381 --> 00:18:00,240
what I learned column for Esquire for
decades and is interviewed million

284
00:18:00,241 --> 00:18:00,901
different people.

285
00:18:00,901 --> 00:18:03,930
And I asked him for feedback when I was
starting the podcast to read some of the

286
00:18:03,931 --> 00:18:06,720
transcripts and to see if he saw
opportunities for improvement.

287
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:11,160
And he said such a nice guy, real
sweetheart of a guy, and he said,

288
00:18:11,161 --> 00:18:15,810
let the silence do the work.
Because I was trying to rescue people.

289
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:18,360
If I asked a question and it started
meandering or something like that,

290
00:18:18,361 --> 00:18:20,760
I would jump in and he goes,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

291
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:25,850
You need to give them more space and
give them time to follow up or to add to

292
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,640
their answer. But it's, I think it's very
unnatural. Even if you're not a pleaser,

293
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:33,060
as a human being in
conversation, it's, it's,

294
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:37,530
it's unnatural to leave a lot of space.
But as an interviewer,

295
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,640
it's really, it seems
really, really useful. Uh,

296
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,360
you mentioned a Ross Perot
and him being pugnacious.

297
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:51,440
Is there a toolkit or a more effective
way to respond to someone in an interview

298
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:56,460
if they are ordinary or a pugnacious?
Okay.

299
00:18:57,290 --> 00:19:00,930
Um, I don't know. I think,

300
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:06,740
I think it depends on the situation.
Uh, I remember he was like, Katie,

301
00:19:06,741 --> 00:19:07,950
Katie,
you know,

302
00:19:07,951 --> 00:19:12,930
sort of admonishing me like I was
misbehaving fifth grader or something. Um,

303
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,850
but I think, uh, you know,
that's a hard, I don't know.

304
00:19:17,851 --> 00:19:22,851
I think you just have to kind of stand
your ground and not be intimidated.

305
00:19:24,271 --> 00:19:28,380
I think people like that want
you to back down or want you,

306
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:31,080
want to make you uncomfortable and,
and,

307
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:34,500
and make you ill at ease
and catch you off guard.

308
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:39,360
So I think you just have to really work
at maintaining your composure and not be

309
00:19:39,361 --> 00:19:40,171
thrown by it.

310
00:19:40,171 --> 00:19:43,920
And that's very hard on national
television to not be thrown by someone,

311
00:19:43,921 --> 00:19:45,420
kind of scolding you.
Right.

312
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:49,880
What's, you mentioned, the
facial expressions and so on,

313
00:19:49,881 --> 00:19:53,510
which is something I haven't
even considered because
this is my very first few

314
00:19:53,511 --> 00:19:56,330
experiments in video, so I'm
not now I'm like, oh my God,

315
00:19:56,331 --> 00:20:01,190
what have been doing with
my face? But, uh, if you're
being scolded on national TV,

316
00:20:01,191 --> 00:20:05,810
it's not just what you say, it's also how
you respond. Right. Of course. Of course.

317
00:20:05,811 --> 00:20:10,010
So you really have to have trained a
poker face or at least some awareness.

318
00:20:10,011 --> 00:20:14,090
Self awareness. Yeah. Through the
profession. That seems really hard.

319
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,250
I would definitely get fired
if my thought bubbles right.

320
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:20,240
Perfect. Came public,
that's for damn sure.

321
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,370
But on the flip side,

322
00:20:22,371 --> 00:20:27,030
are there any interviews that he that
come to mind? You've had so many, uh,

323
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:30,920
but where after you're done,

324
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:35,360
you just in the moments of finishing
the interview, thank yourself God,

325
00:20:35,361 --> 00:20:36,830
I hope the equipment was working.

326
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,650
Like I really hope we caught
that because it was so good.

327
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:43,040
Are there any that come to mind
where like, oh wow, that was really,

328
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,010
that's one that I'm really proud of.

329
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,860
Yeah,
I a lot.

330
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:48,813
Uh,

331
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,380
I think one that's sort of,

332
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:57,590
that I usually dust off when I'm asked
this question is one I did after the

333
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:03,800
massacre it at Columbine
high school and it was four,

334
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:09,660
maybe 4:00 AM Colorado time is
how many hours behind New York,

335
00:21:09,661 --> 00:21:13,450
two or three, three, two.

336
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:19,070
So it was 5:00 AM and
it was April and yet,

337
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:23,460
and so this guy was pitch
black but it was snowing.

338
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:26,580
So it was this very dramatic,
dramatic scene.

339
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:31,680
And I interviewed Michael Shoals who had
lost his son, Isaiah and Craig Scott,

340
00:21:31,681 --> 00:21:35,940
who had lost his sister Rachel
and they were so broken,

341
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:40,800
understandably broken,
shattered, not even broken.

342
00:21:40,801 --> 00:21:44,430
They were shattered and it
had happened the day before

343
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:48,210
and they came on the today show,

344
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:52,050
which I think is always
such an interesting thing.

345
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:57,560
Why do people in this grief stricken
state come to talk about their loved ones?

346
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:01,170
I've always been fascinated by that and
thought it would be a really excellent

347
00:22:01,171 --> 00:22:06,171
thesis for a psychology student
about grief and sort of the public

348
00:22:06,691 --> 00:22:09,840
acknowledgement of grief.
And Anyway,

349
00:22:09,841 --> 00:22:11,820
they came and uh,

350
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:17,730
and it was just a heartbreaking interview.

351
00:22:17,731 --> 00:22:22,200
And to witness them kind of
looking to each other for comfort.

352
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:27,560
Michael shoals was a big burly black
guy and Craig Scott was this sort of

353
00:22:28,651 --> 00:22:32,610
angelic toe headed teenager.

354
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:38,130
And I've actually stayed in touch
with Craig Scott and they held hands,

355
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:43,740
uh, during the interview. And
it was just, it was sort of the,

356
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:50,210
the personification of loss and
sorrow and these two people and

357
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:59,190
just holding onto each other for
dear life. It was really profound.

358
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:03,480
It was really, I was
witnessing it less. Uh,

359
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:04,403
I was Whitney's,

360
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:09,510
I was witnessing it more than
interviewing them, you know,

361
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:14,540
because they were in this particular
space and I was an observer really.

362
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:20,060
So I always think about that interview
as being after it was over a really

363
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,680
important interview for people to watch.

364
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:29,370
And I hope I handled it in a sensitive,

365
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:35,060
thoughtful way that both
respected them as human beings,

366
00:23:36,091 --> 00:23:41,091
but also guided them so they
could express themselves,

367
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:45,530
you know, are situations where
you just really want people too.

368
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,530
You really want to help
them get through it.

369
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,960
I mean there are all kinds
of situations I'm sure,

370
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:55,290
and all the interviews you've done,
there's some cases where you know,

371
00:23:55,291 --> 00:24:00,291
you want to afflict the comfortable and
there are other cases when you want to

372
00:24:00,621 --> 00:24:04,460
come to comfort the afflicted.
And that was definitely the latter.

373
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:09,950
And so, uh, just helping
them through it. And, uh,

374
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:14,030
that was a really,
I don't want to say special,

375
00:24:14,031 --> 00:24:16,850
but significant experience
for me as a person.

376
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:21,830
So I want to, I want to explore
this. I'm writing down that one.

377
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,340
There times when you want to afflict
the comfortable tells me we're going to

378
00:24:24,341 --> 00:24:25,110
cover that.

379
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:28,190
Say is the journalist's job.
I've never heard that before. No,

380
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:33,100
no, that's really useful. Heuristic,

381
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:39,520
uh, want to talk about
grief a bit? So I've,

382
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:42,100
uh,
I've lost a number of,

383
00:24:42,101 --> 00:24:47,070
like I mentioned close friends and a
mentor in the last 12 months. And uh,

384
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,610
you mentioned your husband, uh,
who passed away earlier. Uh,

385
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:55,030
and if I get any facts wrong,
obviously please correct me.

386
00:24:55,031 --> 00:24:58,750
But colorectal cancer 42 40,

387
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:03,610
which really caught my attention.
And My,

388
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:07,570
the first time I had an opportunity to
go abroad outside of the United States

389
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:10,870
was to Japan as an exchange student.
And I lived with a family,

390
00:25:10,871 --> 00:25:15,370
went to Japanese high school and I'm
still close to that family 25 years later.

391
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:20,590
And the father and that host family
is my second father effectively.

392
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:24,610
And I plan on bringing my American family
to Japan later this year to meet them

393
00:25:24,611 --> 00:25:26,710
for the first time,
my two families.

394
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:30,770
And I just found out that my host
father is in the hospital, uh,

395
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:35,230
late stage,
very aggressive cancer diagnosed,

396
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,640
uh, as metastasized, probably will
pass away in the next two months.

397
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:43,450
And what kind of cancer? Uh, it's,

398
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,700
I would have to go back to
the email because it was,

399
00:25:45,701 --> 00:25:50,440
it was very emotional and then cognitively
difficult for me to translate because

400
00:25:50,441 --> 00:25:54,910
there's a lot, it's in Japanese and it
was all specialized medical terminology,

401
00:25:55,680 --> 00:26:00,310
but it's, it's in the lung, it's in
the liver. Uh, a lifelong smoker,

402
00:26:00,311 --> 00:26:02,710
very typical for Japanese of that age.

403
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:06,550
I think it might be also a soft gel,
but um,

404
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:11,770
and it's, uh, I know that it has,
it's now also in the lymph nodes,

405
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:15,350
so he's intubated in the hospital
and only the mother and the,

406
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:18,930
the brothers can come visit.
Uh,

407
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:22,050
so this is ha has had me
thinking about grief and uh,

408
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,790
is there anything I should do
in advance to prepare for that?

409
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:29,260
And they'd just be very curious if you're
willing to talk about it to describe

410
00:26:29,261 --> 00:26:34,261
your experience of grieving and you
could start at any point in time,

411
00:26:35,201 --> 00:26:37,240
but as it relates to your experience with,

412
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:40,120
with your husband and certainly after
that we can get into it. But I mean,

413
00:26:40,121 --> 00:26:41,870
you've done a tremendous job of,

414
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:46,950
of highlighting the types of diagnostic
tools and preventative tools that people

415
00:26:46,951 --> 00:26:49,410
can use, which we'll talk about. But

416
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:51,750
okay.

417
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,700
I don't even know how to
think about grief. I mean,

418
00:26:53,701 --> 00:26:56,310
I don't know if I've allowed myself
to ever experience it before,

419
00:26:56,311 --> 00:26:59,070
but I know I'm going to be hit
with a hammer. I thought though,

420
00:26:59,071 --> 00:27:03,270
you had a couple of friends that I
did. No, I did. They have passed away.

421
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:08,400
And it's been very recent that it hasn't
been this close. These are friends,

422
00:27:08,401 --> 00:27:13,320
but they're not a second father to
me. Uh, and I think in a sense the,

423
00:27:13,321 --> 00:27:15,750
um, the mentor passed away.
It did hit me pretty hard,

424
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:20,070
but if the only in the last six to 12
months actually been allowing myself to

425
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:23,130
feel more things, that's a
much longer story. But, uh,

426
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:27,560
have a kind of a conflicted
relationship with this person.

427
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:32,950
I know I've had a lot of armor for
decades that have built up over time for a

428
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:35,200
lot of different reasons and,
um,

429
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:38,260
it's been very useful for
some things for protecting me,

430
00:27:38,261 --> 00:27:41,920
but I've realized that it also keeps a
lot in that is very ultimately corrosive.

431
00:27:41,921 --> 00:27:46,921
So I'm trying to develop
more of an ability to feel
and instead of looking at it

432
00:27:49,451 --> 00:27:51,610
as a liability,
um,

433
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:56,350
slash I don't know. How do you,
how do you describe grief? Um,

434
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:57,980
okay.

435
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:02,420
I mean, I, I can talk a little bit about
my personal experience. You know, I had a,

436
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,560
I was on top of the world,
had this great job,

437
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:11,090
had two beautiful children,
and of course a wonderful husband.

438
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:14,390
Uh,
I have to say we were having challenges,

439
00:28:14,391 --> 00:28:19,391
some challenges in our marriage because
I think I had this just sort of out of

440
00:28:19,701 --> 00:28:24,470
the blue success and some suddenly
became a household name and had all this

441
00:28:24,471 --> 00:28:25,340
attention,

442
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:30,590
which I think can put a lot of pressure
on a relationship or suddenly it doesn't

443
00:28:30,591 --> 00:28:34,940
feel the power dynamic doesn't
feel as equal. Right. Um,

444
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:40,820
but, uh, you know, we were,

445
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:44,570
we were really, you know,

446
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:48,860
and love and enjoying our lives and,

447
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:54,710
uh, you know, just out of the
blue, Jay hadn't been feeling well.

448
00:28:54,711 --> 00:28:58,230
He had been tired. He'd been traveling
and we kept thinking, oh, east,

449
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:02,960
we have two little kids. He's
covering the Oj Simpson trial. He was,

450
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:06,050
uh, you know, his schedule was crazy.

451
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:11,120
And then out of the blue he just was
doubled over in pain. And our nanny,

452
00:29:11,121 --> 00:29:16,040
who was Irish at the time called and said,
Jay's doubled over in pain and,

453
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,780
uh,
I don't know what to do.

454
00:29:17,781 --> 00:29:22,200
So he didn't have a doctor like
so many young men, which is,

455
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:24,890
you know, if anybody
takes, there are many,

456
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:28,160
I think takeaways from our conversation,
I hope.

457
00:29:28,161 --> 00:29:31,340
But one is that men especially,

458
00:29:31,341 --> 00:29:34,550
I think because women go
see gynecologists honestly,

459
00:29:34,551 --> 00:29:39,551
that a lot of men don't go
and get physicals or they
don't even have a GP or an

460
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:40,694
internist.

461
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:45,790
And Shay was one of those guys who played
Lacrosse and football and in college

462
00:29:45,791 --> 00:29:50,650
and was never smoked ever. I know
that he ever even tried a cigarette.

463
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,920
I never,
I don't think he even tried pot ever.

464
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:58,230
It's sort of crazy when you think
about it. Drank moderately, uh,

465
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:02,680
took pretty good care of
himself. I mean, and uh,

466
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:08,500
and it just boom,
he had stage four metastatic colon cancer.

467
00:30:08,501 --> 00:30:11,740
So we went from one day,
just everything was great.

468
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,680
We were buying a house in the country and,

469
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,280
or had a house in the country
and we're really enjoying that.

470
00:30:18,281 --> 00:30:23,281
And Jay was riding horses in central
park and doing his thing professionally.

471
00:30:23,351 --> 00:30:28,150
And I was at the today show and our
girls were great. And, uh, we had,

472
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:28,481
I mean,

473
00:30:28,481 --> 00:30:33,481
Carrie was less than a year at the time
or just had turned a year old when he

474
00:30:33,641 --> 00:30:38,641
was diagnosed on April 3rd,

475
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,980
1998, 1997. Sorry,

476
00:30:41,981 --> 00:30:46,510
he died nine months later in January.
But,

477
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:49,480
um, you know, it's just, it's so,

478
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:54,370
it's so debilitating and shattering
and destabilizing and you know,

479
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:59,460
it's such a process and I was in such
denial and he was one of these very smart

480
00:31:00,851 --> 00:31:03,280
people, but he didn't want
to know about his health.

481
00:31:03,281 --> 00:31:06,520
He didn't want to know the gory details.
I don't know why,

482
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:08,290
because he was so smart,

483
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:13,120
intellectually curious and
interested and I don't know,

484
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:17,680
maybe he knew. So I kept all this
stuff from him, which I really regret.

485
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:21,580
I would say, oh, there's only
shadows on your liver. Don't worry.

486
00:31:21,581 --> 00:31:25,060
It's going to be okay. Uh,
we're going to figure it out.

487
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:28,150
I remember sending his scans to Nih,
you know,

488
00:31:28,151 --> 00:31:30,640
cause I had a lot of
connections because of my job.

489
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:36,270
And I remember very prominent cancer
scientists calling me and saying,

490
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:39,910
Oh God, this is, this is really bad. He,

491
00:31:39,911 --> 00:31:42,580
I arranged for him to get
a hepatic artery pump,

492
00:31:42,581 --> 00:31:47,230
which pushed the chemo directly to
his liver that was covered. I mean,

493
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:50,140
the tumor burden on his liver was

494
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:57,010
awful. And, uh, anyway,
so I was, I went into,

495
00:31:57,011 --> 00:31:58,240
I think my,

496
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:02,680
my husband John says I'm very
good in an emergency. You know,

497
00:32:02,681 --> 00:32:07,681
I get very focused and very
proactive and driven and I went into,

498
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:12,730
I am going to try to fix this mode.
And uh,

499
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:17,530
so I was sort of doing that I think
to avoid the grief because I had to do

500
00:32:17,531 --> 00:32:20,260
something and it was just,
I mean, what can I say?

501
00:32:20,261 --> 00:32:24,670
It's the worst thing in the world
to see someone, first of all,

502
00:32:24,671 --> 00:32:29,671
your life just changed in an instant then
to see someone's suffering then to try

503
00:32:30,971 --> 00:32:35,020
to figure out how can you help
somebody. I mean, it's just,

504
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:38,710
it's really overwhelming and uh,
you know,

505
00:32:38,711 --> 00:32:43,711
I think grieving process began the day
he was diagnosed because my doctor,

506
00:32:45,891 --> 00:32:50,660
who was the internist, Jay went to see
when he was in this pain. You know,

507
00:32:50,661 --> 00:32:54,830
he pulled me aside and to one of those
little patient rooms in the hospital and

508
00:32:54,831 --> 00:32:57,800
said, it's, it's the, this is really bad,

509
00:32:57,801 --> 00:33:02,300
that the prognosis is very bleak.
So what do you do with that?

510
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:07,330
Except for do everything you
possibly can to change the outcome,

511
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:13,490
which you realize you probably
can't change anyway. It's a very,

512
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:17,960
uh, challenging thing to
deal with, but you know, I,

513
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:21,830
maybe my regrets will help you
with your situation and that

514
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,730
I never really said to Jay,

515
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,240
what are your hopes and
dreams for your kids?

516
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:31,970
Can you write the girls a letter?

517
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:36,290
Can we videotape you talking to them?
Uh,

518
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:42,250
to say everything I wanted to say to
him because that was an acknowledgement

519
00:33:42,471 --> 00:33:45,230
that he was going to die
and I just couldn't do that.

520
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:50,770
So maybe if things are so bleak for
this person is so special to you,

521
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,760
first of all, you need to tell
him no and you need to write him.

522
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:59,690
Maybe go see him and feel that,

523
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:05,050
that you don't have any regrets.
Thank you.

524
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:07,893
Okay.

525
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:14,900
So the only segue I can possibly
think of from that is very close to,

526
00:34:14,991 --> 00:34:15,220
yeah,

527
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:19,150
they can always go what I used to do
on the today show, on a lighter note,

528
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:24,900
I mean I suppose on a lighter
note, although it's, it's a,

529
00:34:24,901 --> 00:34:28,590
it's a shade of the same color.
Uh, so there's, there's a very

530
00:34:30,990 --> 00:34:35,880
interestingly titled Paper in an
Academic Journal and the title is quote,

531
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:39,540
the impact of a celebrity promotional
campaign on the use of coal, uh,

532
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:42,690
colon cancer screening,
the Katie Kirk effect.

533
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:47,580
And it goes on to detail the increase in
the number of colonoscopies because of

534
00:34:47,581 --> 00:34:52,230
your awareness campaign or campaigns.
Uh, so, and I was looking at this,

535
00:34:52,231 --> 00:34:54,180
I've read a lot of
studies and the p values,

536
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:57,870
so the likelihood that it could be
attributed to chance is really, really,

537
00:34:57,871 --> 00:35:02,310
really low. I mean it's, the data are
really compelling. Looking at this,

538
00:35:02,311 --> 00:35:05,970
can you, can you tell us the
story of how it happened?

539
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:10,830
Well, that's a university of
Michigan study. I think that paper,

540
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:15,600
and I think it was in the annals
of internal medicine possibly,

541
00:35:15,601 --> 00:35:17,760
which I think in this case
should be called the angels.

542
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:23,650
But I basically really wanted to educate
people because I didn't understand

543
00:35:26,161 --> 00:35:29,370
colon cancer. I didn't, I'd
never really heard of it.

544
00:35:29,371 --> 00:35:34,320
I guess I had vaguely when President
Reagan had a polyp and I thought,

545
00:35:34,321 --> 00:35:37,380
Gee, I have this opportunity. I
have this bully pulpit pulpit.

546
00:35:37,381 --> 00:35:41,910
I have a platform to educate
people. So, um, again,

547
00:35:41,911 --> 00:35:44,490
Jeff Sucker,
who at the time was my executive producer,

548
00:35:44,491 --> 00:35:49,140
he ironically had also been diagnosed
with colon cancer in his thirties.

549
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:54,930
And so he was a very receptive
audience for my idea. And I said,

550
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:59,910
can I get a colonoscopy on television?
I don't, I'm too young to get one.

551
00:35:59,911 --> 00:36:02,070
You know,
was wasn't 50 yet.

552
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:06,810
I was only 41 when my husband died.
But I said,

553
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:09,660
we need to demystify this procedure.

554
00:36:09,661 --> 00:36:13,590
So that was my thinking
to just educate people.

555
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,830
And um,
and it was sort of,

556
00:36:16,831 --> 00:36:21,540
this was before people were doing
things like this and talking about it,

557
00:36:21,541 --> 00:36:26,541
but it just seemed a
perfectly logical thing to do.

558
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:32,030
And I think it was very helpful for me
in a situation where I felt so powerless

559
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:34,320
and I don't know about you,

560
00:36:34,321 --> 00:36:38,520
but that's the worst feeling in the world
world to feel powerless feeling. No.

561
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:43,700
And so here was an opportunity for me to
use whatever power I did have to maybe

562
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,960
help other people and
possibly even save some lives.

563
00:36:48,961 --> 00:36:53,820
So that was really the
thinking. And uh, you know,

564
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:58,910
that that's sort of started me on a
journey to be a cancer advocate for all

565
00:36:59,041 --> 00:37:04,041
kinds of cancer and to continue
emphasizing the importance of screening.

566
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:09,180
I'm taking a very well known person to
get his first colonoscopy next week.

567
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:12,210
And um,
you know,

568
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,440
I really appreciate people's willingness
to talk about this and just spread the

569
00:37:16,441 --> 00:37:18,960
word.
And because it's so preventable,

570
00:37:18,961 --> 00:37:23,961
it has a 92% cure rate if it's detected
early and it's the second leading cancer

571
00:37:23,971 --> 00:37:27,990
killer of men and women combined.
So I feel like, you know,

572
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:32,070
that will probably be the
first line in my obituary.

573
00:37:32,071 --> 00:37:34,470
I hope it won't be journalists,

574
00:37:34,471 --> 00:37:38,100
but it will be sort of
cancer advocate and uh,

575
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:42,270
and it's something I'm really
proud of that I was willing to do.

576
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,940
Well, I would say even at this point,
it could be the first line in this, in,

577
00:37:47,941 --> 00:37:50,700
in certainly a number of
measurable senses, right?

578
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:55,730
So your cofounder of Standup to cancer
and that has raised more than 500 million

579
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:58,970
at this point to fund scientific
research team. That's a lot of money.

580
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:02,720
That's a big chunk of change.
There's a big chunk of change. Yeah.

581
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:07,200
And that's what started by
nine women who together, um,

582
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,360
we're frustrated with the
pace of cancer research.

583
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:15,370
I think standup has really changed the
paradigm of how cancer research is done.

584
00:38:15,371 --> 00:38:19,270
It's really emphasizing collaboration
rather than competition getting these

585
00:38:19,271 --> 00:38:21,910
institutions and you know,

586
00:38:21,911 --> 00:38:25,750
pharmaceutical companies and biotech
firms to actually talk to each other,

587
00:38:25,751 --> 00:38:29,570
to pull their re pull pool,
their resources and,

588
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:31,300
and their brain power really.

589
00:38:31,301 --> 00:38:36,100
And it's since been adapted by
people like Sean Parker, Joe Biden,

590
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:38,950
when it comes to the way
they're approaching cancer.

591
00:38:38,951 --> 00:38:43,490
So it's been a phenomenal thing.
I'm so proud of these women.

592
00:38:43,491 --> 00:38:45,310
So proud of these scientists.

593
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:49,120
Cause at first they weren't
too jiggy about collaborating.

594
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:49,891
Well that's what,

595
00:38:49,891 --> 00:38:54,860
that's a really complex potentially
complex problem to solve.

596
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:55,430
Right?

597
00:38:55,430 --> 00:39:00,220
It's worked better than others. Yeah.
Quite candidly. But uh, you know,

598
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:05,250
we've been able to get three drugs
approved by the FTA and a lot of promising

599
00:39:05,321 --> 00:39:10,321
research done because the scientists
are willing to work together and it just

600
00:39:11,981 --> 00:39:15,070
makes all the sense in the
world. But it does, it's against,

601
00:39:15,071 --> 00:39:18,670
are kind of very primal impulses to,
you know,

602
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:23,710
be credit mon green and not want to
share the spotlight with people. So it's,

603
00:39:23,711 --> 00:39:26,990
it, it, at times it's been challenging,
but now that it's been great. Yeah.

604
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:32,070
What are the ingredients or the strategies
that your team is used to encourage

605
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,900
these people who have not previously
collaborated to collaborate? Yeah,

606
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:38,490
I don't know. You know, I
think their shoe, it's, I,

607
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,400
I don't give the organization any credits.

608
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:44,350
Their sheer decency and their,

609
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:49,590
their desire to really help patients and
to come up with better treatments for

610
00:39:50,171 --> 00:39:53,980
so many people who have suffered from
this disease and lost the battle.

611
00:39:53,981 --> 00:39:58,030
So I think that, you know, it
was just different, you know,

612
00:39:58,031 --> 00:40:00,340
people don't like change as you know.
Yeah.

613
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:04,060
And it was just a different way
of doing things. And as I said,

614
00:40:04,061 --> 00:40:08,710
I think in some cases maybe it hasn't
been as successful as it could have been.

615
00:40:08,711 --> 00:40:12,730
In other cases it's just
been amazingly successful.

616
00:40:12,731 --> 00:40:17,530
So you know, these are the real heroes,
by the way, these cancer scientists,

617
00:40:17,531 --> 00:40:22,350
first of all,
they are ridiculously intelligent,

618
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:25,410
brilliant people.
And you know,

619
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:29,580
these are the people who should be on the
cover of celebrity magazines and they,

620
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:32,890
we should be doing award
ceremonies for them.

621
00:40:32,891 --> 00:40:37,891
They sh they should be the
real rock stars of our culture.

622
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:43,720
Unfortunately they don't
get much attention. They
don't get that much funding.

623
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:49,140
They just don't get what they
deserve as far as I'm concerned.

624
00:40:49,721 --> 00:40:51,700
So they're amazing.

625
00:40:51,701 --> 00:40:55,640
And that's been another really
gratifying part of this work is to get,

626
00:40:55,690 --> 00:41:00,690
get to getting to know the scientists who
are so selfless and so hardworking and

627
00:41:01,931 --> 00:41:04,030
so dedicated to helping people.

628
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:09,800
I'd love to ask you about how you choose
projects because we just discussed as a

629
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:16,660
c it seems like a very
natural consequences of your
personal experience and then

630
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,280
capitalizing on the platform
and the assets that you have.

631
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:21,480
So it was a very natural fit.

632
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:27,260
I can only imagine that you get hundreds
and thousands of proposals that I'm

633
00:41:27,301 --> 00:41:31,140
sure other people help that with basic
criteria, but I don't really don't.

634
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:32,850
So how do you select,

635
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:36,770
you must have so much inbound and
certainly throughout your career I would

636
00:41:36,771 --> 00:41:37,850
imagine.
I don't know.

637
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:41,710
I mean I don't really, I've
worked for companies, you know,

638
00:41:41,711 --> 00:41:46,600
I uh, in local news and jumped around,
which you sort of had, you know,

639
00:41:46,601 --> 00:41:51,580
at the time you kind of had to do to get
experience and become confident and you

640
00:41:51,581 --> 00:41:54,850
know,
reporting and doing on air work.

641
00:41:54,851 --> 00:41:59,851
And then I worked at companies
like NBC for 15 maybe 20 years,

642
00:42:00,611 --> 00:42:04,450
if you count my time covering the
Pentagon and working in local news.

643
00:42:04,451 --> 00:42:07,930
So probably 20 years,
then went to CBS for five.

644
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:13,380
Then I did a talk show for two
that I worked at Yahoo for four.

645
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:18,720
So I've really worked for big companies
servicing them and doing what I needed

646
00:42:20,291 --> 00:42:24,590
to do to hopefully contribute to what,
you know,

647
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:28,000
their general mission was. And, um,

648
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:32,950
and now I'm sort of, I don't know,
I'm just kind of at a weird place.

649
00:42:32,951 --> 00:42:37,951
I do things that I believe will have
impact that give me creative freedom.

650
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:43,660
Uh, sometimes I miss working for companies
because I love working with people.

651
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:47,200
I'm a super sociable person and I like,

652
00:42:47,201 --> 00:42:51,940
I really get energy from other
people and the atmosphere I'm in.

653
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:55,960
Um, but now I, I'm just
trying to figure it out.

654
00:42:55,961 --> 00:43:00,880
And it's hard because the landscape
is so fragmented and there are so few

655
00:43:00,881 --> 00:43:05,110
communal experiences. When I did the
today show, I sort of felt like, oh,

656
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:09,160
not everybody. I didn't, I wasn't
that egotistical, but I thought, oh,

657
00:43:09,161 --> 00:43:13,780
a lot of people are kind of watching this.
And it felt kind of like a community.

658
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:17,500
And now, I mean, a lot of people
still watch the today show,

659
00:43:17,501 --> 00:43:22,501
but it just seems there's so many options
and so many things to do with our time

660
00:43:23,951 --> 00:43:27,550
and this attention economy that,
um,

661
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:30,610
Tristan Harris talks about.
Do you know Tristan Harris?

662
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:34,310
Yeah, I know of him. I had stopped him.
You would love him. Fascinating guy.

663
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:38,340
33 years old. He's an
amazing person. I let,

664
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:42,890
I interviewed him for my nat
Geo series, but um, you know,

665
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:43,460
uh,

666
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:46,820
so I just tried to do things that I'm
going to enjoy that I think will somehow

667
00:43:46,821 --> 00:43:51,170
contribute to the conversation
and that will get some attention.

668
00:43:51,171 --> 00:43:52,370
But that's hard,
you know?

669
00:43:52,371 --> 00:43:57,371
So I think right now you just have to
do things you really enjoy and like,

670
00:43:58,070 --> 00:44:00,240
you know,
devoting your time to,

671
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,580
what do you do it in your
time to right now? And I'm,

672
00:44:04,581 --> 00:44:08,950
I'm thinking maybe that's the leading
question or am I, I'm suppose,

673
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:13,360
I suppose what I'm hoping to explore
a little bit is a America inside out.

674
00:44:13,870 --> 00:44:18,190
And if you could tell us what that
is and why you chose to do it.

675
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:19,213
Well,

676
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:23,690
I decided to leave Yahoo when
it was bought by Verizon.

677
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:29,720
No hurt feelings. I just, it was
never really the right fit for me.

678
00:44:29,721 --> 00:44:33,540
And I've, I've talked about that a little
bit with Kara Swisher. He pressure,

679
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:37,830
you know, Kara, Kara on the podcast.
Yeah, she's great. I really like Cara.

680
00:44:37,831 --> 00:44:42,740
I just like her, no bs, very no bs. Yeah.

681
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:47,200
And I, but I also think
she's a very kind person. Um,

682
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:51,750
probably not everyone who she's written
about feels the same way. But, um,

683
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,690
I wanted to,
uh,

684
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,930
I wanted to explore some of these
issues that I thought were not getting

685
00:44:57,931 --> 00:44:58,764
attention.

686
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:03,510
Biz Stone in this book I wrote
about advice said if you see a need,

687
00:45:03,511 --> 00:45:04,590
fill it,
you know,

688
00:45:04,591 --> 00:45:08,340
in terms of what to do with your life
or if you're entrepreneurial or if you

689
00:45:08,341 --> 00:45:12,360
want to,
if you want to be of service to people.

690
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:16,650
And I think basically, don't we all want
our book, our work to matter? I think,

691
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:20,610
I don't think making money is
the be all end all for people.

692
00:45:20,611 --> 00:45:24,960
Maybe it's easy to say that once
you've made some money, but, um,

693
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:29,160
I wanted to explore these topics that I
thought were getting short shrift in the

694
00:45:29,161 --> 00:45:33,690
media, that, that everything
is so ephemeral now.

695
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:38,650
You can't even remember partially because
there's so much happening at once.

696
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:42,960
You can't remember what Donald Trump
did two days ago or you can't remember.

697
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:46,680
I mean, it's so much.
It's TMI, isn't it? Yeah.

698
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:48,750
And I think you see,

699
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:53,250
you can't even digest it and
think about it and contemplate it.

700
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:57,450
And I felt like everything's
happening so fast.

701
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:00,300
Can we think about things a little more?

702
00:46:00,301 --> 00:46:04,290
And what are some of the things that
I believe we should be thinking about?

703
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:07,770
And it was, they were things that
were happening before our eyes,

704
00:46:07,771 --> 00:46:10,380
but we weren't really giving
them any considerations.

705
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:15,380
So I had done a documentary for National
Geographic called gender revolution

706
00:46:15,901 --> 00:46:20,901
about our changing notions of gender and
how were people are not really binary

707
00:46:21,931 --> 00:46:26,280
as much as they used to be with
very specific male, female, blue,

708
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:31,250
pink, you know, traits. And you
grow up and you're this way. Um,

709
00:46:31,350 --> 00:46:32,183
and now I,

710
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:37,220
this whole notion of gender fluidity
and kind of being nonbinary and all this

711
00:46:38,251 --> 00:46:41,820
stuff was really,
they were relatively new concepts for me.

712
00:46:41,821 --> 00:46:46,821
And I had whiffed on an interview
I did with Laverne Cox and uh,

713
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:51,450
Carmen Carrera and less with Laverne.
But with Carmen when I asked her, uh,

714
00:46:51,451 --> 00:46:55,830
an inappropriate question
about her genitals,

715
00:46:55,831 --> 00:47:00,831
basically her private parts and I taped
the interview and at the time I thought

716
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:09,120
she was quite offended and
told me why. And I said, I'm,

717
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:11,040
when the producers asked,
I said,

718
00:47:11,041 --> 00:47:14,700
keep that in because I want people
to understand why that's an offensive

719
00:47:14,701 --> 00:47:18,420
question if you don't mind me asking.
What was the question? I said,

720
00:47:18,450 --> 00:47:21,810
what's the situation with
your private parts, you know,

721
00:47:21,811 --> 00:47:24,000
about gender reassignment surgery?

722
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:27,750
And it just grossly inappropriate.

723
00:47:28,110 --> 00:47:31,390
But I didn't really that and I was
trying to do, believe it or not,

724
00:47:31,391 --> 00:47:36,391
a public service by at least talking about
transgender individuals and trying to

725
00:47:37,061 --> 00:47:40,900
help people understand it.
So my motives were actually pure,

726
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:46,410
but my question was really clumsy and
I kept it in the show and it got just,

727
00:47:47,470 --> 00:47:52,470
I remember I was on a plane going to ces
and it was my birthday and I looked on

728
00:47:53,411 --> 00:47:54,940
Twitter.
Oh my God,

729
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:59,050
I'm surprised there wasn't smoke coming
out of my phone because it was just

730
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:03,760
merciless.
I need the scathing criticism I got.

731
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:06,850
And I of course regretted
that I kept it in,

732
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:11,200
but I kept it in for the right
reasons too. But I ended up,

733
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:15,100
long story short, sorry, I'm going on
and on about this, but I ended up saying,

734
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:19,720
you know, I want to learn.
I want to understand. I felt
bad. I also felt, you know,

735
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:23,650
defensive and upset.
But ultimately I said,

736
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:27,370
I need to educate myself and I need
to help other people understand this

737
00:48:27,371 --> 00:48:28,204
community.

738
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:32,890
So I did a documentary
called Gender Revolution for
National Geographic and they

739
00:48:32,891 --> 00:48:36,790
were quite pleased with it and I was
happy that I was able to do it and I

740
00:48:36,791 --> 00:48:39,580
learned a lot. So then they
came back to me and they said,

741
00:48:39,581 --> 00:48:44,320
would you like to do some war?
So I didn't have a job at the time.

742
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:45,700
Um,
and I thought,

743
00:48:45,970 --> 00:48:49,570
and I think this is sort
of the new way of working,

744
00:48:49,571 --> 00:48:51,910
you don't necessarily work
for one company, right?

745
00:48:51,911 --> 00:48:55,030
You do it more project by project.
Um,

746
00:48:55,300 --> 00:49:00,220
and I really done so pretty much every
job and network news at this point in

747
00:49:00,221 --> 00:49:03,160
time. So I said sure, I'd love to.

748
00:49:03,161 --> 00:49:08,161
And I came up with six topics that I
thought deserved a little more analysis or

749
00:49:08,921 --> 00:49:13,921
exploration and that's the series and
it's really been interesting and really,

750
00:49:15,851 --> 00:49:19,540
really exhausting. What are some
of the topics? So I'm doing,

751
00:49:19,541 --> 00:49:24,520
the first one is called rewriting history,
but I'm spelling it R, I, g, h, t, I,

752
00:49:24,521 --> 00:49:25,354
n,
g.

753
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:30,280
And it's really about our memorial
landscape and confederate iconography,

754
00:49:30,281 --> 00:49:30,941
statues,

755
00:49:30,941 --> 00:49:35,941
monuments that led me to Charlottesville
right before and during that quote

756
00:49:37,961 --> 00:49:42,460
unquote outright rally. That by the
way, is not Charlottesville, Virginia.

757
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:47,760
People have now associated this kind of
bigotry and disgusting white supremacy

758
00:49:49,181 --> 00:49:53,290
as being relating to Charlottesville.
It has nothing to do with Charlottesville.

759
00:49:53,291 --> 00:49:58,210
They picture let's fill because I
think it's a progressive town. And um,

760
00:49:58,630 --> 00:49:59,650
so it's,

761
00:49:59,651 --> 00:50:04,651
it's really on how these
confederate statues are dividing us,

762
00:50:05,201 --> 00:50:10,201
that they're so important for some
southerners who see it as celebrating

763
00:50:12,371 --> 00:50:17,371
southern heritage and so offensive to
black Americans who feel they are a real

764
00:50:20,201 --> 00:50:25,201
poke in the eye and supporting people
who wanted to perpetuate the institution

765
00:50:25,991 --> 00:50:28,140
of slavery.
So I just wanted to peep,

766
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:32,780
I wanted to hear more about that
where the controversy started in

767
00:50:32,781 --> 00:50:33,800
Charlottesville.

768
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:38,480
It was started by a 16 year old African
American high school student who started

769
00:50:38,481 --> 00:50:43,250
a petition and I went to see
Mitch Landrieu in New Orleans.

770
00:50:43,251 --> 00:50:46,910
I talked to Julianne Moore who did a
petition to change the name of her high

771
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:48,800
school in Northern Virginia.

772
00:50:48,801 --> 00:50:52,460
And then I went and talked to Brian
Stevenson of the equal justice initiative,

773
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:57,470
who is just one of my personal
heroes about his project,

774
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:58,220
which he's doing.

775
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:03,220
You would love him and lynching project
where he is collected soil from the

776
00:51:03,231 --> 00:51:07,790
lynching sites from 4,400 lynching sites
throughout the south because that's a

777
00:51:07,791 --> 00:51:12,710
chapter of our history. Those literally
been buried and well not literally,

778
00:51:12,711 --> 00:51:15,290
but yes,
literally and figuratively and buried.

779
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:20,090
And he has taken the soil with the help
of descendants of people who've been

780
00:51:20,091 --> 00:51:25,091
lynched and put the soil in Mason jars
with the name of the lynching victim on

781
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:27,193
the jar.

782
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:32,270
And he has a home memorial that
he's opening in Montgomery in April.

783
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:37,400
He's a very deeply thoughtful person,

784
00:51:38,210 --> 00:51:43,210
does a lot of work with mass incarceration
and with sort of the long tail of

785
00:51:43,401 --> 00:51:48,401
slavery and how it's affected race and
African Americans in this country long

786
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:54,920
past the civil war. So anyway,
that's kind of like, I mean we're,

787
00:51:54,921 --> 00:51:57,530
can you really watch something
like that on television

788
00:51:57,820 --> 00:52:01,120
and you see is the what,
what would be success for you?

789
00:52:01,630 --> 00:52:03,590
Not In terms of views or
anything like that, but the,

790
00:52:03,610 --> 00:52:07,120
the impact of an episode
that on say a viewer, is it,

791
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:09,570
is it that they changed their mind?
Is it that they see it,

792
00:52:09,850 --> 00:52:14,850
they view an issue that before was just
a sound bite or two headlines and they

793
00:52:15,041 --> 00:52:19,060
see the shades of gray in something
that was actually very nuanced.

794
00:52:19,061 --> 00:52:20,770
What do you hope it will do?

795
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:25,700
Number two would be really
good at deeper understanding.

796
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:29,990
Uh, a, a, uh,

797
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:35,200
I guess remembering what it feels like
to have empathy for some of these point

798
00:52:36,081 --> 00:52:40,970
of view, to um, have more context,

799
00:52:40,971 --> 00:52:43,940
to be able to talk about
it in a more educated,

800
00:52:43,970 --> 00:52:48,770
intelligent way to, I
don't know, you just,

801
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:54,040
there's so much surface stuff you don't
really know what's underneath what lies

802
00:52:54,861 --> 00:52:56,120
beneath the story.

803
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:01,960
And oftentimes I think if
you do a little digging,

804
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:05,450
then you just have,

805
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:08,620
you just understand it more
and you can talk about it and,

806
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:13,490
and a less kneejerk way in a more nuanced,

807
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:17,540
less emotional, empathetic,
empathetic way. You know,

808
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:21,050
these statues for a lot
of people are deeply,

809
00:53:21,051 --> 00:53:25,130
deeply offensive and I don't think
they belong in public squares,

810
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:27,840
in public spaces, which are
very important, you know,

811
00:53:27,841 --> 00:53:30,150
in terms of setting the
tone for a community.

812
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:35,280
That's why urban planners spend a lot
of time thinking about these things and

813
00:53:35,281 --> 00:53:36,390
uh,
it's,

814
00:53:36,391 --> 00:53:41,391
it's just thought provoking and I don't
think we think about these things enough

815
00:53:41,431 --> 00:53:44,790
or have an opportunity to really
talk about them. So that's just one.

816
00:53:44,791 --> 00:53:48,450
I'm doing one on what it's like to
be a Muslim in America right now.

817
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:53,340
Because there's so many prejudices
and misconceptions about Islam,

818
00:53:53,341 --> 00:53:54,570
about Muslims,

819
00:53:55,110 --> 00:53:58,950
and 50% of Americans say
they'd never met a Muslim.

820
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:04,230
And so I'm trying to introduce
some of them to those people,

821
00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:08,640
to Muslims virtually. And
um, you know, I don't know.

822
00:54:08,641 --> 00:54:13,641
I'm trying to just foster some kind of
deeper understanding and connection for

823
00:54:14,071 --> 00:54:17,460
people with things that may
seem foreign to them with,

824
00:54:17,670 --> 00:54:22,670
with things that they may feel strongly
about but don't necessarily know why.

825
00:54:22,710 --> 00:54:24,330
Maybe it's because their friends do.

826
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:27,660
Yeah. Maybe their beliefs aren't
actually their beliefs at all.

827
00:54:28,170 --> 00:54:32,340
The beliefs of their parents or their
coworkers or whatever it is that they've

828
00:54:32,341 --> 00:54:35,100
absorbed. Yeah. They didn't
worry about it through thought.

829
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:38,230
They write farm fed

830
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:41,630
from their, from their news feeds. Sure.

831
00:54:41,930 --> 00:54:46,640
Through likeminded people who share
their beliefs. And I don't know,

832
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:51,110
it's, it's kind of ambitious to
even want to do that. And you know,

833
00:54:51,350 --> 00:54:56,350
I just have to keep trying
because that's what I enjoy doing.

834
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:01,480
And I do think that I possibly could
be a helpful conduit for people.

835
00:55:01,731 --> 00:55:06,731
A proxy for the average Joe or chose the
dean who is curious about the world and

836
00:55:07,731 --> 00:55:11,720
wants to understand it better and wants
to meet people and talk to people and

837
00:55:11,721 --> 00:55:15,530
see if they can, I don't know,
trying to make sense of it all.

838
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:17,533
I Dunno,

839
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:21,490
does that, I think that's
it. I think that's a very
noble objective. I know that.

840
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:26,770
I think, I think if you aim for that, even
if you partially fail, you will still,

841
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:32,710
you will still create a lot of positive
change, right. Since I could be, I mean,

842
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:37,320
that would be certainly what
I would tell myself that a

843
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:38,153
try.

844
00:55:38,190 --> 00:55:43,190
And I do think this younger
generation is much more receptive to,

845
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:48,540
you know, trying to change the
world in a good way. You know,

846
00:55:48,541 --> 00:55:52,920
you see those kids in Parkland,
Florida and it's just so moving.

847
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:56,460
And so, um, you know, I'm hoping,

848
00:55:56,520 --> 00:56:00,030
I'm hoping that it will,
it'll maybe, I don't know,

849
00:56:00,570 --> 00:56:04,940
get people to talk to their friends
about it and maybe counter some of this

850
00:56:04,941 --> 00:56:08,940
stuff that they're seeing
and say, actually, you know,

851
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:13,350
white extremists have committed three
times the violent acts that Muslim

852
00:56:13,351 --> 00:56:17,610
extremists have committed since
nine 11 or in the last 15 years.

853
00:56:17,850 --> 00:56:22,800
But the media coverage leaves you with
the perception that's not the case. Right?

854
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:28,260
And so we can all kind of just be more
aware and more critical and not in a

855
00:56:28,331 --> 00:56:29,081
negative way,

856
00:56:29,081 --> 00:56:33,760
but critical thinkers about the
kind of information that's incoming.

857
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:38,050
I know we only have a few minutes left.
If you had a billboard,

858
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:42,800
metaphorically speaking, and you
could put a word, a phrase, a quote,

859
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:46,940
any type of message or question to get
out to millions or billions of people,

860
00:56:48,170 --> 00:56:49,910
what might you put on that billboard?

861
00:56:50,890 --> 00:56:53,680
I'm watching three billboards right now.

862
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:56,920
All I can think of is the billboards that,
uh,

863
00:56:57,430 --> 00:57:02,110
Frances McDormand put up. Um, uh,

864
00:57:02,230 --> 00:57:06,730
you know, there's so many important
things, right? I guess I would say, uh,

865
00:57:06,910 --> 00:57:10,960
something about voting, you know, if
you don't vote, you can't complain.

866
00:57:12,150 --> 00:57:12,790
Okay.

867
00:57:12,790 --> 00:57:15,650
There are ways to vote too. I
mean, I understand the literal.

868
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:20,440
Yeah. I mean, I think for me it's
actually the elections, right?

869
00:57:20,830 --> 00:57:25,830
Because I think it's what
55% of Americans voted.

870
00:57:26,021 --> 00:57:31,021
It was the worst turnout in it
since I think 1994 or something.

871
00:57:32,341 --> 00:57:36,970
And, and I just don't understand
how people can be that apathetic.

872
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:41,650
They have to care about the country and
they have to educate themselves about

873
00:57:41,651 --> 00:57:45,940
the issues. And I just, uh,

874
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:50,500
it's just infuriating to me
that people don't vote. And so,

875
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:53,620
especially in the
midterms and they need to,

876
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:59,940
they need to really hold our politicians
accountable and if they want to,

877
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:01,451
you know,

878
00:58:01,451 --> 00:58:06,130
be the change they wish to see or
whatever they need to get involved in the

879
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:09,340
political process.
So I think that's what I would do.

880
00:58:10,210 --> 00:58:15,210
I get infuriated me if people didn't vote
in the last election or they threw it

881
00:58:15,461 --> 00:58:18,250
the way their vote by voting for someone,

882
00:58:18,850 --> 00:58:23,570
that just would never be
a of chance. Right, right.

883
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:27,820
And I felt like saying to them,
that's a vote for the other person.

884
00:58:27,821 --> 00:58:31,090
If you're comfortable with that,
you, you know, just so you know,

885
00:58:31,630 --> 00:58:36,430
that's helping elect someone,
you may not want to be precedent.

886
00:58:37,210 --> 00:58:42,100
And so I just, I just hope people take
that really, really seriously. And I,

887
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:47,170
I don't know, I just hope they vote
for people for the right reasons too.

888
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:51,390
Yeah. And the focus on action
instead of complaining,

889
00:58:51,391 --> 00:58:53,160
I think that you can simulate,

890
00:58:53,161 --> 00:58:57,030
you can create the illusion of action by
jumping on social media and complaining,

891
00:58:57,031 --> 00:58:57,490
but,

892
00:58:57,490 --> 00:58:59,200
or they call that slacktivism right?
Yeah.

893
00:58:59,250 --> 00:59:00,360
Slacktivism yeah.

894
00:59:00,361 --> 00:59:03,360
You need to actually get up off
your ass and make things happen.

895
00:59:03,361 --> 00:59:05,880
And part of that is
engaging in ways like that.

896
00:59:06,010 --> 00:59:09,550
Yeah. Um, but that's, I think,
what would you put on a billboard?

897
00:59:13,390 --> 00:59:18,030
Damn. Flying Question. I
would say I might put up, uh,

898
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:20,290
I've thought about this of course.
Cause I asked this question a fair amount.

899
00:59:21,210 --> 00:59:25,670
I would, I would put up, uh, I'll give,
I'll give two answers. I'm going to cheat.

900
00:59:25,671 --> 00:59:28,220
But the one that I usually say is you
are the average of the five people you

901
00:59:28,221 --> 00:59:32,450
associate with most. So psychologically,
emotionally, politically,

902
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:33,793
physically,

903
00:59:33,910 --> 00:59:37,040
you are going to be the average of the
handful of people you spend the most time

904
00:59:37,041 --> 00:59:41,270
with. So pick those people very, very,
very carefully. Um, and the, the other,

905
00:59:41,271 --> 00:59:44,570
I'm actually stealing from Bj Miller,

906
00:59:44,571 --> 00:59:48,290
who's a hospice care physician,
also triple amputee.

907
00:59:48,291 --> 00:59:53,180
He was a warning story when I attended
Princeton because a few years before he

908
00:59:53,181 --> 00:59:57,440
had been climbing on this commuter train
called the dinky and it was wearing a

909
00:59:57,441 --> 01:00:01,250
big watch and electricity art and
burned off three of his limbs.

910
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:05,240
And he since became at
Princeton and he sent,

911
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:08,840
he as well after that point became an MD,

912
01:00:09,350 --> 01:00:13,850
has helped a thousand plus people to
die with terminal diagnoses in something

913
01:00:13,851 --> 01:00:16,510
called the Zen hospice
center. But he, he's,

914
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:21,511
he's since expanded beyond that San
Francisco and they have a very uncommon

915
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:27,530
approach to death and,

916
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:32,560
and shepherding people from a terminal
diagnosis to ultimately passing.

917
01:00:32,571 --> 01:00:34,810
And they do it in a really
beautiful way, uh, that,

918
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:38,330
that I think lens piece to
a lot of people. And when
I asked him this question,

919
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:43,040
he also, in turn, he said,
got it from a bumper stickers.

920
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:46,790
Who knows who ultimately said this, but
he said, I would put on a billboard,

921
01:00:46,791 --> 01:00:48,260
don't believe everything that you think.

922
01:00:49,370 --> 01:00:52,580
And I thought that was really
profound to contemplate.

923
01:00:52,910 --> 01:00:56,750
That's good for my series. Yeah. Don't
believe everything that you think.

924
01:00:57,980 --> 01:01:02,510
So I revisit that a lot myself. And that
can be your beliefs about other people,

925
01:01:02,511 --> 01:01:04,550
but also your beliefs about yourself,
the stories,

926
01:01:04,551 --> 01:01:09,260
the narratives that you escape to that
ultimately don't serve you, don't.

927
01:01:10,490 --> 01:01:15,260
Sounds like a remarkable person. Has He
gotten a lot of attention? Not Enough.

928
01:01:15,290 --> 01:01:16,740
Not enough attention. He, he,

929
01:01:16,870 --> 01:01:21,440
he's an English readily think
this is an APP person. I should,

930
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:25,490
you would love this. You would love
him. He's, he's incredible. And

931
01:01:27,410 --> 01:01:31,810
he does, he has, he has
procecies or prosthetics and,

932
01:01:31,870 --> 01:01:36,800
and he, he sees these cities,
whatever it is, he has those.

933
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:41,150
And we actually talked to the podcast
at some point. He mentioned in passing,

934
01:01:41,151 --> 01:01:43,250
it's like, well, the other week
when I was riding my motorcycle,

935
01:01:43,251 --> 01:01:46,580
and then he kept going and I said, wait,
hold on. You're missing three limbs,

936
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:47,600
you have a motorcycle.

937
01:01:47,630 --> 01:01:51,410
And he told me about this process he
went through with the help of many people

938
01:01:51,411 --> 01:01:53,980
to custom modify a motorcycle.
He,

939
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:58,040
he wanted to be on a motorcycle to feel
the wind in his face and he rides a

940
01:01:58,041 --> 01:02:02,180
motorcycle.
He's a fascinating guy and hilarious.

941
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:07,070
Bj Miller as I married. Uh,
I don't think so, but I'm,

942
01:02:07,071 --> 01:02:11,130
I'm unsure. Yeah. You met him when
he spoke at Princeton. No worries.

943
01:02:12,490 --> 01:02:15,320
I heard about him.
I saw him initially in the,

944
01:02:15,321 --> 01:02:18,740
I believe it was the Princeton
Alumni weekly, the alumni magazine,

945
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:22,260
and I tore out that page and I said one
day I'm going to track this guy down.

946
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:25,440
I put it into a scrapbook. And that
was before I ever started the podcast.

947
01:02:25,470 --> 01:02:28,290
And then at one point,
I don't know how it happened exactly.

948
01:02:29,010 --> 01:02:31,140
It might've been an email
from someone else who said,

949
01:02:31,141 --> 01:02:35,050
do you know who it was an email from
someone else has from a scientist at UCF?

950
01:02:35,470 --> 01:02:38,340
He said, well, Duh, Duh,
Dah, something something. Bj
Miller. I said, wait a second.

951
01:02:38,341 --> 01:02:42,300
That rings a bell. Google search on my
God. That's that guy. Years ago I said,

952
01:02:42,301 --> 01:02:45,300
someday I'm going to meet. And
I said, I'll do one better.
I want to interview him.

953
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:47,770
And that's how it came to.

954
01:02:48,050 --> 01:02:49,860
And so did have you become friends?

955
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:52,150
I would say we're definitely
on friendly terms.

956
01:02:52,151 --> 01:02:53,830
I still haven't met him in person.

957
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:55,220
Oh my gosh.
Well you have

958
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:59,910
and um, he's a, he's an
incredible, incredible man.

959
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:01,940
You should do your podcast,
you know,

960
01:03:01,941 --> 01:03:05,690
like on location sometimes
I would say it really does,

961
01:03:06,490 --> 01:03:10,070
uh,
Linda different feel to the podcast.

962
01:03:10,071 --> 01:03:13,820
You could go to his, actually,
it would be incredible.

963
01:03:13,850 --> 01:03:16,670
You should go to his hospice.
Yeah.

964
01:03:17,030 --> 01:03:21,710
And you should talk to some
of his patients that would
be so profound and then

965
01:03:21,711 --> 01:03:24,650
put together.
I'm talking to your producers over there.

966
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:29,150
I put together something that would
be really beautiful because people,

967
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:31,700
myself included really don't,

968
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:35,430
don't still don't know how
to talk about death. Yeah.

969
01:03:36,140 --> 01:03:40,010
They are terrified of it. I am. Yeah. Uh,

970
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:41,870
and uh,

971
01:03:41,930 --> 01:03:46,930
I think that you would be doing such a
public service to help help people kind

972
01:03:48,591 --> 01:03:51,740
of get a different perspective
on dying if that's possible.

973
01:03:53,350 --> 01:03:58,180
If my own thinking about the subject is
any indication based on conversations

974
01:03:58,181 --> 01:03:59,890
with people like Bj and based on,

975
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:01,973
okay.

976
01:04:03,470 --> 01:04:05,270
Speaking with someone like you
and asking you about grief.

977
01:04:05,271 --> 01:04:07,070
This is why I'm asking because I don't,

978
01:04:07,071 --> 01:04:10,160
I don't yet feel like I have a complete
toolkit for even thinking about it.

979
01:04:10,490 --> 01:04:15,190
You should also read Sheryl
Sandberg's book option B. Yeah.

980
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:18,160
Which I thought was really brave
of her to write with Adam Grant,

981
01:04:18,161 --> 01:04:21,700
who's also great. You should interview
Adam Grant too. I think I should just be,

982
01:04:21,701 --> 01:04:24,760
you know me. You Must Know Adam, right?
We've treated email before. I need to,

983
01:04:26,130 --> 01:04:26,963
but um,

984
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:30,550
you should read that book because I think
it might be very useful for you. Great.

985
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:34,960
No, I'll, I'll take a look at it.
And uh, yeah, I actually went,

986
01:04:35,050 --> 01:04:37,700
was that a group dinner
with her? Uh, you know,

987
01:04:37,990 --> 01:04:41,830
then husband just a few months
before everything happened.

988
01:04:42,790 --> 01:04:45,120
You just never know. I
mean, what if it's right?

989
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:46,853
I always think,

990
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:51,180
wouldn't it be cool if people had a
crystal ball and they would see what's

991
01:04:51,181 --> 01:04:54,570
coming that that's such a, you
know, it's always such a mystery.

992
01:04:54,571 --> 01:04:59,430
Like what's around the
corner. And, um, you know,

993
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:03,930
if you could somehow have
a glimpse into the future,

994
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:08,630
it's just crazy to think
that you course you can.

995
01:05:08,650 --> 01:05:10,360
But sometimes I think about that.

996
01:05:10,550 --> 01:05:14,570
I do have two friends, uh, bleed,

997
01:05:14,630 --> 01:05:17,560
Kevin Kelly's one who's it?
Fascinating, fascinating guy.

998
01:05:17,561 --> 01:05:20,860
We could talk about another
time, uh, as an Amish beard,

999
01:05:20,861 --> 01:05:22,120
spends time with the Amish,

1000
01:05:22,121 --> 01:05:25,690
but he's a technology futurist
with an impeccable track record.

1001
01:05:25,691 --> 01:05:28,840
Looks at Silicon Valley. He's built his
own house, spends time with the Amish.

1002
01:05:28,870 --> 01:05:29,410
Yeah.

1003
01:05:29,410 --> 01:05:32,680
It's all because he's fascinated by how
they choose to adopt technology or not.

1004
01:05:32,820 --> 01:05:35,530
Oh. And uh, in any case, uh,

1005
01:05:35,531 --> 01:05:40,531
he and another friend named Antonio
have excel spreadsheets or clocks that

1006
01:05:41,651 --> 01:05:44,080
they'd look at every morning
that based on actuarial tables,

1007
01:05:44,081 --> 01:05:47,920
tell them how many years, months, days,

1008
01:05:48,130 --> 01:05:50,080
hours and minutes they
have left in their life,

1009
01:05:50,110 --> 01:05:54,570
just as a reminder of their
mortality, intense butts, um,

1010
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:55,840
and isn't dense.

1011
01:05:55,930 --> 01:06:00,930
So we are at time and
hopefully we can continue

1012
01:06:02,310 --> 01:06:06,030
the conversation someday talking to you
and I would love to interview you at

1013
01:06:06,031 --> 01:06:06,864
some point.

1014
01:06:07,250 --> 01:06:09,770
That would be an incredible honor.
I would love to do that.

1015
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:15,400
And in the meantime people can see you
at work and doing what you do best.

1016
01:06:15,951 --> 01:06:20,510
America inside out,
which premieres on national geographic.

1017
01:06:20,570 --> 01:06:23,030
Uh, I believe right on
National Geographic Channel,

1018
01:06:23,031 --> 01:06:26,990
April 11th at 10:00 PM six park,
a docu series.

1019
01:06:26,991 --> 01:06:29,360
So I will link to that in the show notes
as well as to everything that we've

1020
01:06:29,361 --> 01:06:33,220
talked about already. Those
of you, I really appreciate
it. Of course, who listen.

1021
01:06:33,230 --> 01:06:37,010
And those of you who watched
him.blog/podcast is where
you can find links to

1022
01:06:37,011 --> 01:06:41,780
everything on social media at
Katie Couric on all the socials.

1023
01:06:41,870 --> 01:06:42,600
Yeah,

1024
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:44,490
I, you know, it's, it's, gosh,

1025
01:06:44,491 --> 01:06:49,190
it's such a fulltime job servicing
the social media platforms,

1026
01:06:49,210 --> 01:06:52,000
isn't it? It can. It's
also really fun. I mean,

1027
01:06:52,001 --> 01:06:54,250
I have to say I'm really,

1028
01:06:54,251 --> 01:06:59,020
I really enjoy using Instagram
because it's a way to feel,

1029
01:06:59,021 --> 01:07:03,220
I don't know. You do get a sense of
community with Instagram. It has a,

1030
01:07:03,221 --> 01:07:07,090
it has the feel of a
friendlier neighborhood to
or just some of the others,

1031
01:07:07,091 --> 01:07:08,710
which compared to Twitter,

1032
01:07:08,850 --> 01:07:11,230
more like a neighborhood where you
walked on the street whistling and people

1033
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:13,660
just throw potted plants at
your head. Yeah, exactly.

1034
01:07:13,661 --> 01:07:16,600
Isn't always how you want to feel.
If you want to have, if you want to,

1035
01:07:16,601 --> 01:07:17,950
if you want to be an insomniac.
Yeah.

1036
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:20,030
Check your Twitter feed right
before you go to bed. Oh yeah.

1037
01:07:20,610 --> 01:07:22,610
I got out of a very funny
situation where right.

1038
01:07:22,660 --> 01:07:26,410
Couldn't sleep one night
and I got on Twitter.

1039
01:07:26,411 --> 01:07:28,240
I was using my device way too much.

1040
01:07:28,241 --> 01:07:32,110
I did a whole hour on technology
for this series as well.

1041
01:07:32,350 --> 01:07:36,640
And uh, suddenly I'm in a
conversation with Chrissy Tiegen,

1042
01:07:36,641 --> 01:07:40,580
Valerie Bertinelli and one other person.
Uh,

1043
01:07:41,770 --> 01:07:43,360
I want to say Anna Gas Dyer,

1044
01:07:43,510 --> 01:07:48,510
we're all talking about not being able
to sleep at like three in the morning.

1045
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:53,810
It was so insane. And I was
like, okay, this is social media.

1046
01:07:55,130 --> 01:07:57,250
Who'd a thunk thunk? It, you only

1047
01:07:57,670 --> 01:08:02,130
pitting against companies who put
billions of dollars into r and D to, uh,

1048
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:06,840
throw everything scientifically
vetted at your brain to distract.

1049
01:08:07,140 --> 01:08:08,840
So you're completely outgunned.
You were out.

1050
01:08:09,110 --> 01:08:12,050
I know.
And that's one of my hours.

1051
01:08:12,051 --> 01:08:14,620
And that's what I talked to Tristan about.
Yeah.

1052
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:19,990
They manipulate you to keep you addicted
with absolutely no responsibility for

1053
01:08:22,220 --> 01:08:24,140
understanding. And should they, I mean,

1054
01:08:24,141 --> 01:08:27,650
do you think that tech companies
need to be held accountable for that?

1055
01:08:28,010 --> 01:08:29,780
I think tech companies,
uh,

1056
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:33,620
ultimately if they're going to be as all
encompassing as they certainly appear

1057
01:08:33,621 --> 01:08:35,630
to be,
uh,

1058
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:40,840
do you have a moral
obligation to think about the,

1059
01:08:41,090 --> 01:08:44,720
the intermediate and long
term implications of some
of these technologies,

1060
01:08:45,110 --> 01:08:48,410
even if they're just trying to protect
their bottom line. So for instance,

1061
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:50,990
I mean hopefully I'll take
another minute or two,

1062
01:08:50,991 --> 01:08:54,530
but if you look at autonomous cars,
all right, so self driving car as well.

1063
01:08:55,490 --> 01:08:58,080
3 million jobs, right? So if you, if you,

1064
01:08:58,081 --> 01:09:00,860
you can look at the job shifting
that you can also look at,

1065
01:09:00,890 --> 01:09:05,570
let's just say the decision making that
will have to be embedded into the code

1066
01:09:05,571 --> 01:09:10,520
itself. So if you have a car, let's
say a car gets hit by huge hailstone,

1067
01:09:10,521 --> 01:09:12,710
which these things happen,
right, or whatever it might be,

1068
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:15,470
or a ball comes into the street
and throws the car off course,

1069
01:09:15,471 --> 01:09:19,250
it has to choose between hitting say
three school children on one side of the

1070
01:09:19,251 --> 01:09:22,580
street or 10 uh,
elderly people.

1071
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:25,130
How does it make the decision and
it's going to have to make a game time

1072
01:09:25,131 --> 01:09:28,940
decision or are there times when
the car sacrifices the driver?

1073
01:09:28,970 --> 01:09:33,620
Is that dependent on your insurance
premium is that there's a really gnarly

1074
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:39,880
moral problems and ethical challenges
that previously were relegated to thought

1075
01:09:40,251 --> 01:09:42,110
experiments like the,
you know,

1076
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:45,200
that sort of trolley scenarios and
things like that. So they will,

1077
01:09:45,230 --> 01:09:50,150
they will need to have ethicist and so
on to help advise the programmers who are

1078
01:09:50,151 --> 01:09:53,960
developing the code so that these
machines can make decisions. So yeah,

1079
01:09:53,990 --> 01:09:56,970
they have to think about, it's crazy
though. It sounds like black mirror.

1080
01:09:56,971 --> 01:10:01,460
It doesn't, I know the future is here.
It's just not evenly distributed.

1081
01:10:01,730 --> 01:10:04,600
William Gibson, thank you for that.
And Katie Couric, thank you so much.

1082
01:10:04,601 --> 01:10:06,890
That would be a good billboard.
It would be a good one.

1083
01:10:07,390 --> 01:10:12,040
And I would get a Gif dear Mr. Gibson,
a lot of credit for that, but uh,

1084
01:10:12,050 --> 01:10:16,340
everybody check it out, American side
out and Katie, hopefully to be continued.

1085
01:10:16,370 --> 01:10:19,520
Thank you. So nice meeting
you. Likewise. Thanks.
