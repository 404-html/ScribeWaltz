1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,830
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02,831 --> 00:00:06,010
I can run flat out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:07,650
You would pose some questions.

4
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:13,600
I'm a cybernetic organism.

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,840
Living Tissue Sepsis

6
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:28,660
is brought to you by wordpress.
My goto platform for blogging,

7
00:00:28,661 --> 00:00:31,270
writing online, creating
websites, everything.

8
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:35,290
I love wordpress to bits.
My site,

9
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:40,350
every site just about that I have is run
on wordpress and the lead developer of

10
00:00:40,811 --> 00:00:45,730
wordpress, Matt Mullenweg has
appeared on this podcast many times.

11
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,030
The very first episode
in particular is amazing.

12
00:00:49,031 --> 00:00:53,590
The second I took a ton of notes on,
so he's checking out, but wordpress,

13
00:00:53,591 --> 00:00:58,090
where do I even begin? I mean the
New Yorker uses it, Jay z, Beyonce,

14
00:00:58,091 --> 00:01:01,000
they use it. Five 38
tech crunch, Ted, CNN.

15
00:01:01,001 --> 00:01:05,440
Time with you are looking to create
a personal blog, a business site,

16
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,410
both, neither. Something else.

17
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:13,500
You'll make a huge impact when you
build your website on wordpress.com and

18
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:18,040
directly from some friends at Google.
I'm not going to quote them by name,

19
00:01:18,041 --> 00:01:22,990
but they say that wordpress offers
the best out of the box SEO.

20
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:27,280
That's search engine optimization
imaginable. So if you're on wordpress,

21
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:32,580
you immediately have a leg up on everybody
else on search engines and so forth.

22
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:37,780
In my experience, I'm no medical
doctor of search engine optimization,

23
00:01:37,781 --> 00:01:42,781
but I will say that I used wordpress for
years and fell in love with it to the

24
00:01:44,081 --> 00:01:49,081
extent that I became very close friends
with Matt and then became an investor

25
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:53,590
slash advisor to automatic
which runs wordpress doc on.

26
00:01:53,591 --> 00:01:58,390
That is how much I believe in this and
that's how a lot of my most successful

27
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:02,440
products and investments have come about
because I'm in love with x and then I

28
00:02:02,441 --> 00:02:03,760
seek out x.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Nearly 30% of the Internet
is run on wordpress and that
includes everything from

30
00:02:09,461 --> 00:02:13,930
the huge sites that I mentioned to
neighborhood sites and it is super easy to

31
00:02:13,931 --> 00:02:17,650
get started. There's no need to worry
about security or upgrades or hosting.

32
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:23,170
They offer 24 seven support and handle
all of that which allows you to focus on

33
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:27,520
creating the highest quality content
that you can with the least amount of

34
00:02:27,521 --> 00:02:29,680
friction.
I don't have to worry about downtime.

35
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:33,760
I don't want to have to
worry about getting emergency
emails if I'm on vacation

36
00:02:33,761 --> 00:02:38,200
or something like that, and wordpress
is my goto solution for all of this.

37
00:02:38,201 --> 00:02:43,201
I trust all of my most important
text on the Internet to wordpress,

38
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,860
and they can't buy that with
a sponsorship. They can't
buy that with anything.

39
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,220
I want uptime, uptime,
uptime, and quality,

40
00:02:51,221 --> 00:02:54,400
and that is what I have selected
after everything that I've looked at.

41
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,590
So check it out.
Go to wordpress.

42
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:01,650

Tim

45
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,680
this episode is brought to you by audible,
which I've used for many, many years.

46
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:21,690
I absolutely love audio books and there
one of my favorite ways to pass the time

47
00:03:21,691 --> 00:03:22,470
when I travel.

48
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:26,730
I'm on the road all the time and audible
allows me to consume many more books

49
00:03:26,731 --> 00:03:31,050
than I possibly could otherwise I have
to audio books to recommend right off the

50
00:03:31,051 --> 00:03:34,290
bat. The first is perhaps my
favorite audio book of all time.

51
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:37,620
It's the only audio book I've
wanted to listen to twice in a row.

52
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:42,120
The graveyard book by Neil Gaiman.
It's amazing and you will thank me.

53
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,040
There are a few different versions.

54
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,100
I like the version that
Neil narrates himself,

55
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,620
one of the most soothing
voices of all time.

56
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,630
The second book is vagabonding
by Rolf Potts, p, O, t t, s,

57
00:03:54,631 --> 00:03:58,170
which had a huge impact on my life and
formed the basis for a lot of what would

58
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:00,210
later become the four hour workweek,

59
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:05,150

This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another
episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

70
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:43,270
it is my job to deconstruct world class
performers, to tease out the habits,

71
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,880
routines, favorite books, breakfasts,

72
00:04:45,881 --> 00:04:50,530
whatever it might be that you can
test and apply in your own life,

73
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,890
the specifics, the details,
the beliefs, habits,

74
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,890
and so on that you can
actually use in the real world.

75
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:00,970
And this episode we have a fantastic
guest I've wanted to connect with for a

76
00:05:00,971 --> 00:05:04,880
very long time. Darren
Aronofsky. So who is Darren,

77
00:05:04,881 --> 00:05:05,870
we're going to get to that in a second,

78
00:05:05,871 --> 00:05:09,110
but he was introduced to me
by another podcast guest,

79
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:12,500
Peter Attia who is a medical doctor,

80
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:16,220
an endurance athlete or he would
say former endurance athlete.

81
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:21,230
And I encourage you to also check out
his episodes because it'll put a lot in

82
00:05:21,231 --> 00:05:24,760
context and Peter has three episodes.

83
00:05:24,761 --> 00:05:29,380
If you just go to tim.blog
forward slash a tia, a, t, t I a,

84
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:33,490
you will find three of them. They start
with doctor Peter Tia on life extension,

85
00:05:33,491 --> 00:05:37,900
drinking jet fuel, ultra endurance,
human foie gras and more too.

86
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:41,480
The next one, optimizing
investing blood hormones and life.

87
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:46,280
Then my life extension pilgrimage
to Easter island. It's a long story,

88
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:50,680
but check it out. Tim. Dot blog forward
slash at Tiaa, but back to Darren,

89
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:55,360
Darren Aronofsky. You can find them
on Twitter and Instagram at Darin,

90
00:05:55,950 --> 00:06:00,950
d a r r e n Aronofsky a r o n o f s k
y to say hello and he's doing some very

91
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:07,940
cool stuff on Instagram
and Darren aronofsky.com is
the founder and head of the

92
00:06:07,941 --> 00:06:10,250
production company,
protozoa pictures.

93
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:14,890
He is the acclaimed in award winning
filmmaker behind cult classics like Pi

94
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:18,550
Requiem for a dream and the wrestler
which are really just the tip of the

95
00:06:18,551 --> 00:06:22,900
iceberg when it comes to his filmography,
but going back to the beginning pie,

96
00:06:22,901 --> 00:06:23,740
his first film,

97
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,800
that was 1998 one him early plots and
he best director award at the Sundance

98
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,130
Film Festival.
Aronofsky.

99
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:34,630
That's Daren later directed and produced
the wrestler which I absolutely loved

100
00:06:34,631 --> 00:06:37,030
and made its world premiere
at the Venice Film Festival,

101
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:41,580
which happens to be the oldest film
festival in the world where it became only

102
00:06:41,581 --> 00:06:45,420
the third us film in history when
the esteemed Golden Lion Award,

103
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:50,610
Darren leader directed the Indy box
office phenomenon, Black Swan, which one?

104
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:51,211
Natalie Portman,

105
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:54,600
the Academy Award for best actress and
Garner for other Oscar nominations,

106
00:06:54,601 --> 00:06:58,140
including best picture
then is the inspired epic.

107
00:06:58,141 --> 00:07:02,490
Noah opened at number one at the box
office and grossed more than 362 million

108
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,110
worldwide.
His latest movie,

109
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:08,420
his mother with lowercase
m and an exclamation point,

110
00:07:08,421 --> 00:07:13,020
a psychological horror thriller film
starring Jennifer Lawrence, Javier Bardem,

111
00:07:13,021 --> 00:07:15,540
ed Harris, Harrison, many others,
Michelle Pfeiffer. It goes on.

112
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:20,620
I've had a chance to see this movie and
I'm stumbling over my words because it's,

113
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:24,220
it's hard to describe.
It was mind bending,

114
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,660
super intense.

115
00:07:25,661 --> 00:07:30,661
And I walked around in a dream state
for an entire day after seeing this.

116
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:35,770
It is unlike anything you
have ever seen. So, uh,

117
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,260
if you want to strap on your seat
belt and go on a roller coaster,

118
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:42,710
I suggest that you check it out.
So without further ado,

119
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:47,330
please enjoy my conversation
with Darren Aronofsky.

120
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,640
Darren, sir, welcome to
the show. Thank you Tim.

121
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:56,540
I have been looking forward to meeting
you for some time now, but thank you.

122
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:57,650
I'm a big fan as well.

123
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,300
We have quite a few mutual friends
and I have some suggestions.

124
00:08:02,301 --> 00:08:05,630
I won't mention them by name
yet as to topics and questions,

125
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:10,631
but I wanted to start with a question
about your writing environment.

126
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:16,220
Oh, that's a good question. I've read
a little bit about a desk. You will,

127
00:08:16,221 --> 00:08:17,054
your desk,

128
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:21,560
could you describe this desk
and if you still use it,

129
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:22,940
it was interesting.

130
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:27,940
I know you've spent time in Japan and
so I was in Japan probably promoting,

131
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:34,760
I don't know if it was pio requiem for a
dream and I went to some spa town south

132
00:08:35,471 --> 00:08:37,300
of Tokyo,
I can't remember the name of it.

133
00:08:37,301 --> 00:08:41,970
And I guess it was the kind of nexus of
this place where they make these puzzle

134
00:08:41,971 --> 00:08:46,590
boxes. I don't know if you've ever
seen them. They're kind of beautiful.

135
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:51,950
Pattern would inboxes and you can't
really see any hinges or any spaces,

136
00:08:52,621 --> 00:08:57,621
but if you slide a few panels in a
certain order and it could be up to eight

137
00:08:57,961 --> 00:09:01,470
1632 moves depending on how
much money you want to spend.

138
00:09:01,471 --> 00:09:05,370
Eventually it opens and as a secret
compartment. And it blew my mind.

139
00:09:05,371 --> 00:09:07,950
I had never seen any
type of souvenir like it.

140
00:09:07,951 --> 00:09:11,860
I bought a couple and I played with it
for a long time and then I think it was

141
00:09:11,861 --> 00:09:15,670
early days of Internet. So I started to
Google a little bit about what it is.

142
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:17,530
There's a whole art form,

143
00:09:17,531 --> 00:09:21,520
I won't try to butcher
the Japanese word for it,

144
00:09:21,521 --> 00:09:26,100
but I then noticed that there were
contests worldwide and that there was,

145
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:31,260
there was this one dude who was winning
year after year contest and he was a guy

146
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:34,720
in Colorado. So I was like,
oh, that's kind of interesting.

147
00:09:34,721 --> 00:09:38,680
And so just randomly I tracked
them down and I sent him an email,

148
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:43,210
his name's Kagan sound and I sent
him an email. I said, hey, you know,

149
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,660
did you ever think of doing any
furniture? And he's like, well, actually,

150
00:09:46,661 --> 00:09:50,260
I'm working on this thing for
a library. And I said, well,

151
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:54,880
it'd be interesting maybe to do a
desk out of it. And He loved the idea.

152
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:59,890
And um, then he, it was amazing
and he said it true master. I May,

153
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,410
we should probably go over to my house
to check it out. I would love to say it.

154
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:06,940
David saw it. I don't a if he
told you about it, but he freaked

155
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:12,000
the hell out. David Blaine. Yeah. This
is, this is part of why I'm asking.

156
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,620
Oh, okay, got it. Yeah. So anyway,
uh, he ended up this, this master,

157
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,570
so the whole thing is made
it completely out of wood.

158
00:10:18,571 --> 00:10:22,890
He doesn't work with any other
materials but would, and um,

159
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,630
I'm not sure the count on
puzzles in the desk, but it's,

160
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,610
I mean,
scores of them.

161
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:34,700
And eventually they all sort of work
together to build to a final release where

162
00:10:35,641 --> 00:10:40,530
you basically, it, he was able to
turn it into a musical instrument.

163
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,260
He created bellows all
controlled with wood.

164
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:46,350
And the draws and by
actually pushing the draws,

165
00:10:46,351 --> 00:10:49,140
it create sounds and it has a full octave.

166
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:53,970
And he asked me what song I wanted and
it has, he been, was able to build a,

167
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,290
basically a computer thing that has
switches that are all blown by the bellows

168
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,730
and if they're done in the right order,

169
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:04,020
a panel flaps open in the
back with a secret draw.

170
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,100
So it took him five years
to do it and it was insane.

171
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:11,940
And I think the price we agreed on was
a crime at the beginning cause I am to

172
00:11:11,941 --> 00:11:14,820
him or driving him.
It was a cry that him and I felt so.

173
00:11:14,821 --> 00:11:17,550
And then I realized I didn't have a
chair for it. So then I said, you know,

174
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:21,330
we should make a puzzle chair for it
and that and then out years later and I

175
00:11:21,331 --> 00:11:24,240
paid through the nose for
that to get them back. But um,

176
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,700
it's a beautiful thing
and it's a great desk.

177
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:27,771
I want to say,

178
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:31,640
I read this in a previous interview that
you've referred yourself as a nomadic

179
00:11:31,641 --> 00:11:34,820
writer or writing in one place for a
few weeks and then moving locations.

180
00:11:34,821 --> 00:11:39,821
So how does your writing process
differ project to project or do you,

181
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:40,901
how do you use,

182
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:44,840
say the desk that we were just talking
about and combine that with shifting

183
00:11:44,841 --> 00:11:46,400
locations?
I'm on book deadline right now,

184
00:11:46,401 --> 00:11:50,450
so I'm thinking about this and of course
I'll do anything to avoid writing.

185
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:52,000
Exiting,
including interviews.

186
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:56,870
Exactly. Um, I, I completely understand
that procrastination, but you know,

187
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:58,710
my a writing partner,

188
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,470
a guy right with a lot already handled
once said to me probably the most

189
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:07,420
important thing I taught to him taught
him was that I didn't do this on purpose,

190
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:10,030
is that procrastination
is part of the process.

191
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:13,390
That actually your brain needs
a break every once in a while.

192
00:12:13,391 --> 00:12:15,400
And not to say to abuse that,

193
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:19,390
but to be a little easy on yourself and
allow yourself to go to a bookstore,

194
00:12:19,391 --> 00:12:23,170
to go to a museum to just,
even if you are serious about your work,

195
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,510
even when you're not working,
you're, you are working,

196
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:28,120
your brain is putting stuff
together and you know,

197
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:31,420
inspiration comes from the strangest
places as we all know. You know,

198
00:12:31,421 --> 00:12:35,260
you suddenly stumble on something that's
exactly what you were looking for when

199
00:12:35,261 --> 00:12:38,350
you didn't know you were looking for it.
But it's changed.

200
00:12:38,351 --> 00:12:39,610
My writing process I used to,

201
00:12:39,611 --> 00:12:44,611
what I do was a tremendous amount of prep
where we would do a tremendous amount

202
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:48,680
of research and outlines and eventually
get to a place where were we?

203
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:52,060
We were exhausted with that and then
I would do something called the muscle

204
00:12:52,061 --> 00:12:56,770
draft where I would go and
disappear somewhere usually
far away where I could be

205
00:12:56,771 --> 00:13:01,771
very alone and be very lonely and that
loneliness would inspire me to work hard

206
00:13:01,811 --> 00:13:06,580
and fast and I would muscle out a draft,
which meant I would never go back.

207
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:06,940
It would,

208
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:11,440
it was all about just pounding through
it to get to the end as quick as possible

209
00:13:11,441 --> 00:13:15,410
and it was like a two three day process
and you come that out with like um,

210
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:18,460
w if it ended up being
120 page screenplay,

211
00:13:18,461 --> 00:13:20,740
you'd have an eight 79 80 page screenplay.

212
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:25,630
But in that muscle draft there
would be moments when you,

213
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:29,200
you know,
when you do enter that zone,

214
00:13:29,201 --> 00:13:31,420
I don't know if you have a
term for it if you run into it,

215
00:13:31,421 --> 00:13:34,600
but does that zone when you kind
of forget time, it's, you know,

216
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:38,650
I imagine athletes are doing it and rock
musicians seem to be doing it when they,

217
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:41,950
their eyes roll back in their head. But
as a writer, every while you get that,

218
00:13:41,951 --> 00:13:46,390
where the way of time disappears and
something comes out on the page and that

219
00:13:46,391 --> 00:13:51,220
scene is often something that ends up
staying all the way through to the end of

220
00:13:51,221 --> 00:13:55,900
the process. When you are
muscling out that first draft,

221
00:13:55,990 --> 00:14:00,730
is it in,
are you using screen reading software?

222
00:14:00,731 --> 00:14:05,500
Is it just kind of brain
vomiting bullets on into a, a,

223
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:09,760
a word document? What does it look it's,
I'm trying to think. I mean, you know,

224
00:14:09,761 --> 00:14:14,761
final draft has been around for a long
time now and it's a great software that

225
00:14:14,951 --> 00:14:19,660
I've used. I don't, I don't know if
I'm Pi was written on it. It's hard to,

226
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:22,250
that was [inaudible] 97 so I can't,
I,

227
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:25,540
I doubt it probably I probably
was formatting stuff back then.

228
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:30,220
I don't really remember. Um, but
you know that that just helps you,

229
00:14:30,221 --> 00:14:34,640
it helps you work quicker because you
know, instead of dealing with indentation,

230
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:38,920
you press tabs and shortcuts to get
through it quicker. I mean, you know,

231
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:43,060
screenwriting is very much like
sculpture in the sense that, you know,

232
00:14:43,061 --> 00:14:48,010
if you start with a piece of clay,
you don't want to just focus on the hand.

233
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:50,200
You know, any artists that does
that will tell you, you know,

234
00:14:50,201 --> 00:14:54,040
then the hand will be grossly
low, detailed and enlarged. The,

235
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:55,370
compared to the rest of the body,

236
00:14:56,210 --> 00:15:01,210
you kind of just want to slowly start
cutting away at the clay to get closer and

237
00:15:01,851 --> 00:15:04,670
closer to the final form,
you know,

238
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:08,000
but you don't want to get the sand
paper out till you're ready for that,

239
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,320
like level of detail work.
And so it's just about passes.

240
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:15,830
You keep going through it and once
you say, I'm going to start writing,

241
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:19,880
even if you get the page 30 and you
think, oh, page five need something,

242
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:24,140
you just make a note of it and then
Zap to the end before you ever go back.

243
00:15:24,141 --> 00:15:26,720
So it's,
it's really like working at way,

244
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:29,720
working slowly away that big clay.

245
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:34,880
Do you no longer do the isolation
retreats? I do it less and less. I mean,

246
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:39,590
it's a funny story. I was just telling
my son, this was when I, when I wrote by,

247
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:42,950
uh, my friend actually who
does visual effects for me, um,

248
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:47,510
his parents had a little cabin up
outside of Woodstock and I was like, Hey,

249
00:15:47,511 --> 00:15:50,540
can I go there for a few days and
pound out my muscle draft on Pi?

250
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:51,590
And he was like, yeah, sure.

251
00:15:51,591 --> 00:15:56,300
And I went up there and that his parents
were intellectuals and just had books

252
00:15:56,301 --> 00:15:58,820
and books and books. They were
academics. So there was tons of books.

253
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,060
And then I was looking,
you know, procrastinating,
looking through the books.

254
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:05,750
And of course the only book that
caught my attention was Carrie,

255
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:06,650
which I had never read.

256
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,360
So I proceeded to pound through
procrastinating by Reading Carrie.

257
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:14,510
It's scaring the living crap
out of myself. You know,

258
00:16:14,511 --> 00:16:16,460
when you read king it's just like wow.

259
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:20,030
And then I really had it right quick
cause I had to get the hell out of this

260
00:16:20,031 --> 00:16:24,980
cabin. So I think I wrote the first
draft of pie and like 18 hours. Wow.

261
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,430
But, but to talk about now,
um, it's funny this, this,

262
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:32,310
this new movie mother is very,
very different process. The,

263
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:36,260
the most different process than I've ever
done in probably more similar to where

264
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:37,094
I started.

265
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:42,520
I wrote the script and five days and
it was this kind of fever dream want to

266
00:16:43,341 --> 00:16:47,280
happen. I had had the idea
two weeks before and you know,

267
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:52,390
it started off with this idea for this
allegory with a real kind of relationship

268
00:16:52,701 --> 00:16:56,060
drama at the core,
but I didn't know how to structure it.

269
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:59,030
And then I had this kind of
breakthrough of what the structure is.

270
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,510
And I had a five day weekend without,
uh,

271
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:07,340
my son was with his mom and I was all
alone and I just sat in my kitchen.

272
00:17:07,341 --> 00:17:11,450
I actually am and go up to the desk and
I just pounded it out in my kitchen,

273
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:14,030
in my underwear,
barely eating.

274
00:17:14,031 --> 00:17:19,031
It was just like this fever that came
out of me and in five days and when I was

275
00:17:19,731 --> 00:17:20,511
done with the script,

276
00:17:20,511 --> 00:17:23,750
I showed it to my producers who didn't
know I was even working on something and

277
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,860
they were like, well, while the, I think
there's something here and it's weird.

278
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:32,690
I think I've always been
jealous of musicians. You know,

279
00:17:32,691 --> 00:17:36,290
you hear the story where Bob Dylan wrote
a song in the afternoon and it became,

280
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:40,670
you know, the anthem for a
generation. But as filmmakers,

281
00:17:40,671 --> 00:17:44,690
we really don't get to do that. It takes
us two to five years. I mean, you know,

282
00:17:44,691 --> 00:17:48,590
Black Swan, the first meeting when
Natalie was 10 years before I shot it,

283
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,660
the wrestler was eight years.
The Fountain took me six years.

284
00:17:51,661 --> 00:17:56,450
Noah was an idea for 20 years. You
know, it's a long time. I, I, but I,

285
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:57,000
I was like,

286
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,440
is it possible as a filmmaker to take
a single emotion and a feeling of,

287
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:06,990
and it's kind of what I was feeling right
in that moment and try to channel it

288
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:10,890
into a single track and into a movie.
And I think that's kind of,

289
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:15,180
it kind of captures a single emotion.
This film, even though it has other stuff,

290
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:17,460
it really was one color
that burst right through.

291
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:21,480
I want to talk about something maybe
related to fever dream. So the,

292
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,430
the idea of, or concept of madness, uh,

293
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,230
and uh, I want to say, I'm
certainly paraphrasing that,

294
00:18:31,231 --> 00:18:35,880
that maybe you've said that by walking
the tightrope between sanity and insanity,

295
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:39,720
you can learn what sanity is
or something along those lines.

296
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:45,390
Do you have a fascination
with madness? I mean, if so,

297
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:51,390
or why do people have that perception?
I had an uncle who, um, was,

298
00:18:51,391 --> 00:18:52,410
uh,
schizophrenia.

299
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:57,150
So I grew up around that and
I got to see it. I'm very,

300
00:18:57,151 --> 00:19:02,151
very close and sort of saw his mindset
and also how it weighed on my family and

301
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:10,620
you know, the emotional ripples
from that were tremendous. Um,

302
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:15,990
and I then I also saw how society
treated people like that. And, um,

303
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:17,660
so it's,
uh,

304
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:20,280
it's something I've been very close
to and I've always thought about it.

305
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:24,530
And I remember reading, what
was it, the denial of death.

306
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:27,990
Do you ever read that book?
That's a good one for you. Um,

307
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,380
but they talk about the Liminal,
the line,

308
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:35,820
the thin line between the conscious
and the subliminal, I think,

309
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:38,340
how they were using between
genius and insanity.

310
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:40,530
And there were things that my
uncle would say that, I mean,

311
00:19:40,531 --> 00:19:43,140
he was a highly functioning guy.
He worked at,

312
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:47,850
he worked as an engineer for New York
City for his entire life and you know,

313
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,150
had a pension and all that,
you know, may made it through,

314
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:56,510
but lived a very tough, tough life
because of the illness. But, um,

315
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:59,880
he would say things that were
just unbelievable. Brilliant.

316
00:19:59,881 --> 00:20:01,530
Like I remember one time

317
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:07,470
my dad was talking to him about something,
you know, about how to do something.

318
00:20:07,471 --> 00:20:10,980
I don't remember exactly the
details. And he said, well,

319
00:20:10,981 --> 00:20:12,600
I can't really say this on radio.
Right?

320
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,520
And he said something like, yeah,
that's like, if you fuck a snake, again,

321
00:20:19,521 --> 00:20:23,070
an elephant. And I remember hearing
it, I was whatever I was 12 or 13,

322
00:20:23,071 --> 00:20:27,360
but that's kind of crazy metaphor and
kind of beautiful and it's so extreme,

323
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:31,020
you know, it was like the best
way of saying, yeah, right,

324
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:34,260
like you're selling me
the Brooklyn Bridge. So,

325
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,750
but he had many of those
that would just sort of like,

326
00:20:36,751 --> 00:20:40,980
that's not proper English and,
but it kind of works, you know?

327
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:46,410
Do you, I've always had just
a, an absolute fascination
with that very thin line.

328
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:48,250
Uh,
when I was an Undergrad,

329
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,480
I was, I'm not a
mathematician. I, in fact,

330
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:55,930
part of the reason I went to Princeton
is because at the time at least did not

331
00:20:55,931 --> 00:20:56,764
have a math requirement.

332
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:01,450
I was scared off of math by very a
belligerent teacher in 10th grade.

333
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:05,140
My, yeah, it was terrible. My
brother, in fact, same grade,

334
00:21:05,141 --> 00:21:07,930
different teacher was steered in the
opposite direction and it's just finishing

335
00:21:07,931 --> 00:21:09,880
a phd in social studies teachers can do.

336
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:15,030
But I was drawn to a few specifically
mathematicians at Princeton who were

337
00:21:15,221 --> 00:21:19,390
really riding that razor's edge
and had multiple suicide attempts.

338
00:21:19,391 --> 00:21:23,800
But we're also brilliant beyond all
description. Yeah. I personally,

339
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:27,610
and I in fact also have a
cousin whose schizophrenia,

340
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:31,130
which was relatively later onset and uh,

341
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:35,450
became effectively a different
person's still very smart. Um,

342
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:40,590
but have you ever worried that you
would bleed over that edge and you know,

343
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:47,170
luckily my Hubris doesn't go that
far, get that worry. I'm not,

344
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:51,880
I'm not the, I'm not crazy hypochondriac
and stuff, but yeah, sure. I've,

345
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,350
when I was a,
yeah,

346
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:57,090
I think when I was a teenager and
I read somewhere that like it,

347
00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:01,240
like schizophrenia is onset can
happen in your 20s you know,

348
00:22:01,241 --> 00:22:04,750
that that idea that when you're a fully
formed human being Suddenlink things can

349
00:22:04,751 --> 00:22:09,460
change for you. That was a scary
idea. Will it happen for me? Um,

350
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:12,370
but you know, I, uh, you know, and I,

351
00:22:12,371 --> 00:22:15,250
and I definitely think when it came to,
you know,

352
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:20,230
perhaps exploring, you
know, plant enhancements,

353
00:22:20,231 --> 00:22:24,070
I was always a little terrified that I
might go too far in a certain direction.

354
00:22:24,071 --> 00:22:28,510
But, um, you know, so, so it's always
been in the back of my head a little bit,

355
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:31,600
just cause, you know, a lot
of that stuff is genetic,

356
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:35,370
but I don't think it's really haunting
me. But I guess maybe a little bit, you,

357
00:22:35,371 --> 00:22:38,050
you thought of the possibility
of the fear of it. Yeah. Well,

358
00:22:38,051 --> 00:22:41,800
I almost off myself in college,
so I went through very,

359
00:22:41,801 --> 00:22:43,890
very dark period,
uh,

360
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:49,080
that actually talked about really publicly
in a major way for the first time on

361
00:22:50,051 --> 00:22:54,370
stage at Ted, which really shut the
room down. Well, no, good for you.

362
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:59,200
It's important, but, uh, that is always,

363
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:01,420
or has always been kind
of in the back of my mind.

364
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:05,590
And one of the things that
I got from as you put it,

365
00:23:05,591 --> 00:23:10,591
plant enhancements or
psychedelic experience was
temporarily experiencing what

366
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,770
could only be,

367
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:18,610
I would have to be on some level
synonymous with extreme mental illness

368
00:23:18,611 --> 00:23:19,290
definitely.

369
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:23,260
And having connection and developing
more empathy as a result of living in a

370
00:23:23,261 --> 00:23:27,340
place like San Francisco where you're
just surrounded by people who are homeless

371
00:23:27,341 --> 00:23:29,270
and mentally ill.
Uh,

372
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:34,510
so one of the topics I had down
to talk about was psychedelics,

373
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:38,830
which was suggested by someone we both
know who will remain nameless for now.

374
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:40,550
What I want to know,

375
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:46,830
yes there are only three,
but uh,

376
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:52,370
what role has that played in your life
or how do you think about it as fitting

377
00:23:52,371 --> 00:23:53,200
into your life?

378
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,970
Well, I look, I think it's, I, I've,
I've researched it, read a lot about it.

379
00:23:57,971 --> 00:24:01,930
I think it's very interesting. I
mean, you know, um, the story of, uh,

380
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:07,540
of deer that inside barrier
that eat mushrooms and fall
over and it doesn't seem

381
00:24:07,541 --> 00:24:12,010
like there's any true shouldn't,
you know, survival of the fittest,

382
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:16,660
evolutionary positivity for a
deer to make itself that helpless.

383
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:21,250
So maybe there is something else going
on that some other medicine or something

384
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:26,251
else that this creature is getting out
of putting itself at risk was just a

385
00:24:26,441 --> 00:24:27,310
fascinating idea.

386
00:24:27,311 --> 00:24:32,311
And the fact that shamanism and reaching
alternative states has been just part

387
00:24:32,951 --> 00:24:37,951
of our culture for a super long time and
then somehow got completely washed out

388
00:24:38,051 --> 00:24:42,610
and I don't know, it turned into the
sacrament, maybe rock and roll music,

389
00:24:42,611 --> 00:24:45,370
but we've really lost, um, you know,

390
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,100
anything that's sort of trying to

391
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:53,170
reach away from scientific reality is

392
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:59,800
clearly a loss. And,
um, and it seems like,

393
00:24:59,801 --> 00:25:02,710
um, you know, the,

394
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,800
there's a lot of wisdom to come out of,
you know,

395
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:09,700
some exploration and in a
safe type of examination,

396
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:12,070
as long as very controlled environments,

397
00:25:12,071 --> 00:25:16,720
it's as clearly tremendous benefit.
You know, that's happened, you know,

398
00:25:16,721 --> 00:25:19,570
for society, you know, over eh,

399
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:24,590
that's recently been discovered and
is being rediscovered right now. Yeah.

400
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:30,860
Involved with some research at Johns
Hopkins and a few other places related to

401
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:36,010
use of cell Simon specifically in a
potentially addressing treatment resistant

402
00:25:36,891 --> 00:25:38,180
depression among other things.

403
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:39,830
That's what's fascinating.

404
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:44,970
All that stuff that maps is doing with
PTSD and the fact that this department is

405
00:25:45,071 --> 00:25:48,790
supporting it, you know, because
it seems to be working. You know,

406
00:25:48,791 --> 00:25:51,980
I just saw a film that
came out of Israel that uh,

407
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:57,020
it is using MDM to sort of help people
deal with not just soldiers but people

408
00:25:57,371 --> 00:25:59,800
deal with all different
types of emotional distress.

409
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:04,150
It's fascinating and it's
interesting and um, it's um,

410
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:08,620
clearly, you know, if the Defense
Department is sort of supporting it,

411
00:26:08,621 --> 00:26:13,060
then there's probably some, you know,
it's probably pretty interesting to them.

412
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:18,500
I think it's also a really smart place
for research to start or one at least of

413
00:26:18,501 --> 00:26:23,501
the subsets of the population that's very
smart to work with is returning vets.

414
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:28,710
Yeah. Specifically among other reasons
because it is a nonpartisan issue.

415
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,730
It's very hard to be like,
fuck the vets. Right.

416
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:34,680
Or like screw the terminal cancer
patients who want to decrease end of life

417
00:26:34,681 --> 00:26:35,480
anxiety.

418
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:39,200
It's funny though because another thing
I'm involved with is I'm on the board of

419
00:26:39,201 --> 00:26:43,740
directors for the Sierra Club and a big
part of what cr club is trying to do is

420
00:26:43,741 --> 00:26:48,741
get vets into nature and we have all
these different programs that do that.

421
00:26:48,991 --> 00:26:49,711
And in fact,

422
00:26:49,711 --> 00:26:54,711
I actually went to the Arctic with two
vets and it was amazing for them to sort

423
00:26:54,901 --> 00:26:57,690
of, you know, not just
to have that experience,

424
00:26:57,691 --> 00:27:02,580
which is completely mind expansive
to see, you know, nature in a,

425
00:27:02,581 --> 00:27:07,290
in a true to see true wilderness like
what's happening in the Arctic. But um,

426
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,850
I think to the, a lot of them, what
they expressed to me as they actually,

427
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:15,450
this is what they were fighting for was
the defendant this, you know, in their,

428
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:16,021
their spirits.

429
00:27:16,021 --> 00:27:20,130
So they actually get to see the beauty
of America outside of the cities that

430
00:27:20,131 --> 00:27:20,964
they're from.

431
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:25,550
Continue to talk for a little bit about
really old traditions because what we're

432
00:27:25,551 --> 00:27:30,500
talking about, or at least some of these
traditions have existed for Millennia.

433
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:34,760
Fasting is another one. Yeah. Have
you done experiments with fasting?

434
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,990
A little bit. It's something I
definitely want to get more into.

435
00:27:37,991 --> 00:27:42,670
I've been totally into the idea
for a long time. Of course.

436
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:47,650
Um, you know, I, I fast once a
year, uh, not that I'm religious,

437
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,040
but because I,

438
00:27:49,041 --> 00:27:52,390
I liked the spiritual practice of
fastening once a day with my buddies.

439
00:27:52,391 --> 00:27:55,600
And so I get together with my
friends and fast for that one day.

440
00:27:55,601 --> 00:28:00,520
But a longterm fastening I think is
fascinating and I've heard great stories

441
00:28:00,521 --> 00:28:03,040
about it, but I haven't, I
haven't actually had the,

442
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:08,190
it's amazing how little that goes on
and in our privileged lives and how,

443
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,110
you know, um, that's just a
very interesting practice.

444
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:18,370
What, what is interesting about it to
you? Because I tried to, for instance,

445
00:28:18,371 --> 00:28:22,360
I tried to do and note to people
listening. I'm not a doctor,

446
00:28:22,361 --> 00:28:25,240
I don't play one on the Internet,
so don't be stupid.

447
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:29,190
Talk to a qualified medical professional,
blah, blah, blah. But I've done a,

448
00:28:29,191 --> 00:28:32,410
I tend to do at least three days
of consecutive fasting per month,

449
00:28:32,411 --> 00:28:37,300
and then I'd go longer fasts a few times
per year. Wow. And you do just water?

450
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:42,190
I will make some allowances and I do
it differently at different times,

451
00:28:42,191 --> 00:28:47,191
but what I will sometimes do is use
fasting as a way to kickstart ketosis.

452
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:52,720
So clicking over into
Ketosis, certainly, uh,

453
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:55,390
our friend Peter t knows a lot about that.

454
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:57,910
It was in Kansas for about
two and a half years straight,

455
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:00,370
but fascinating for a period of time.
Uh,

456
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:05,460
and what I will allow if I'm doing a
longer fast in particular is I will allow

457
00:29:06,431 --> 00:29:10,870
myself non caloric drinks that are
unsweetened. So let's say black tea,

458
00:29:10,871 --> 00:29:12,970
black coffee, right? Uh,

459
00:29:12,971 --> 00:29:17,230
and Kit Kat bars and cake only
zero Calorie Kit Kat bars.

460
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:22,210
And I will also, particularly in
the beginning, allow myself, uh,

461
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:26,920
some exotic generates ketones. So
they're just supplemental ketones or fat,

462
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:31,780
like coconut oil to help
with the transition. That
was great, but besides that,

463
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:37,010
amazing Nick's than the pain is after
two, three days, right? It's supposed to,

464
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:37,980
she's off.
Yeah.

465
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,300
For most men,

466
00:29:39,301 --> 00:29:42,610
women can sometimes take a little
longer to click over for most men,

467
00:29:42,611 --> 00:29:46,870
about two to three days. Right. And then
you can, then you can click over. Um,

468
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:51,430
all right, well let's do it. I'm in w
what interests you about the fasting?

469
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:54,100
I mean, it once again, it's just the way,

470
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:59,610
it's clearly a way to explore
other spaces, you know? Um,

471
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,540
I mean I,
I immediately for me,

472
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:08,190
if I've got a difficult meeting where
I kind of have to be a jerk at because

473
00:30:08,191 --> 00:30:13,170
something's not getting done correctly,
you know, if I skipped breakfast and uh,

474
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,920
do it close to when lunches,
you know, I, I get stuff done.

475
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:20,900
So I do it my own way. I do
miss, I do micro micro fasteners

476
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:25,800
to control my mood knowing
that, um, you know,

477
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:30,750
some of that anxiety and anger
will disappear as soon as I eat.

478
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:34,830
So it's sometimes a good thing to
sort of modem I motivate myself to,

479
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:39,060
to help with the work in certain ways.
So I do do my own mood enhancement.

480
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:42,180
I mean for a long time. Um, you know,

481
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,380
I was dating someone and you know, we used
to get at each other. And then finally,

482
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:50,280
um, someone turned me onto the word
hangry, which is the hungry Yang,

483
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:51,750
which I think is probably
pretty common now.

484
00:30:51,751 --> 00:30:53,820
But at the time it was a pretty new word.
And that was,

485
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:57,180
it kind of changed my relationship and
kept the relationship going for three,

486
00:30:57,210 --> 00:30:58,043
four years.

487
00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:01,320
Cause we could actually identify why we
both became assholes for a little bit.

488
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:05,070
So clearly it's a major mood,

489
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:10,380
a blocker and changer and an
alternator and all that stuff.

490
00:31:10,381 --> 00:31:12,810
So I think that's interesting.
And then, you know,

491
00:31:12,811 --> 00:31:15,890
I've heard and read all about
the health benefits of it and,

492
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:19,590
and then of course there's
all the meditative elements
of it to control the mind

493
00:31:19,591 --> 00:31:23,620
over the body and all, you know what,
David Blaine is always demonstrating, um,

494
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:28,460
clearly going to some series
extremes, but, you know,

495
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:32,070
I think there are lessons to be learned
and, and experiences to be, have,

496
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,850
have had during it.

497
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:39,650
This is sort of the nature
of my fragmented mind that
we're going to jump around

498
00:31:39,651 --> 00:31:41,060
a lot. But you, you mentioned, uh,

499
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:44,980
difficult conversations or where
you have to be an asshole. Uh,

500
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:49,010
I had read about, well, very,

501
00:31:49,011 --> 00:31:54,011
very much in passing you having a
conversation with Mickey Rourke before

502
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:58,390
filming. Uh, well these
version. Yeah. Well, no,

503
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:00,590
I actually don't have
a whole lot of content,

504
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:04,190
but roughly that you knew
it wasn't going to be easy,

505
00:32:04,191 --> 00:32:06,260
that he had a lot of strong opinions.
So you had sort of a,

506
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:11,710
an honest upfront and conversation and
I would love to hear how you open a

507
00:32:13,101 --> 00:32:15,470
conversation like that or plan for it.

508
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:19,690
You know, I look, um, you know,
Mickey at the time, you know,

509
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:24,590
had an awful reputation. Um, and I
think that's because, you know, he,

510
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:25,671
you know,

511
00:32:25,671 --> 00:32:30,560
I think he in many ways he was a lot
of his worst enemy because he just,

512
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:35,750
you know, love, love to acting. But
he also loved boxing and you know,

513
00:32:35,751 --> 00:32:40,280
and he had this fight and struggle between
them, which one was going to focus on.

514
00:32:40,281 --> 00:32:43,390
And you know,
I think he was,

515
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:48,380
he really respected the box anyway.
Whatever happened with him, you know,

516
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:51,230
everyone was warning me about him.
Everyone.

517
00:32:51,231 --> 00:32:55,970
But I love him and I loved his work.
Um, you know, before I knew him,

518
00:32:55,971 --> 00:32:58,700
I just, I thought his work
was exceptional and I, it was,

519
00:32:58,701 --> 00:33:03,701
I felt the crime on the acting arts that
he did not have more opportunities to

520
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,940
share himself with the world because
whenever he has shared himself,

521
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:13,510
it was unbelievable from barfly to angel
heart to all of the beautiful early

522
00:33:14,511 --> 00:33:16,580
work he did.
And then it just sort of disappeared.

523
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:21,710
But I just wanted to be very
clear with him because I felt, um,

524
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:27,050
I just knew how challenging the film
we were about to do was going to be.

525
00:33:27,051 --> 00:33:31,490
And I just, I, I find
that the longer I do this,

526
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:33,710
the more clear you can be upfront,
the better.

527
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:38,330
Because no matter what happens,
it always changes.

528
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:42,920
I think sometimes people don't really
hear what you're saying to them a lot

529
00:33:42,921 --> 00:33:47,210
because they really want to do something.
So I try to be very,

530
00:33:47,211 --> 00:33:50,720
very straightforward and clear because
I want to get all the PR as many of the

531
00:33:50,721 --> 00:33:55,721
problems off the table because when we
do get to set time is really the biggest

532
00:33:56,630 --> 00:34:00,410
enemy. Or, you know, pho,
because it's so short and,

533
00:34:00,411 --> 00:34:03,950
and it happens so quickly that if you
start getting to stupid things that

534
00:34:03,951 --> 00:34:06,320
weren't pre discussed,
it's a nightmare.

535
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:10,850
And so you have to be as completely
prepared and professional as you can when

536
00:34:10,851 --> 00:34:14,880
you're spending whatever it is,
$20,000 a minute. Oh, you know,

537
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,720
whatever it may be that day,
you know, you want to, you know,

538
00:34:17,721 --> 00:34:20,420
Mike Tyson tie money time
is what I'm talking about.

539
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,910
You want to be on top of your game.

540
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:27,170
So I just went in very clearly with
making it, I think, I think, well,

541
00:34:27,171 --> 00:34:30,710
what it meant for Makey for it is like he,
he looked at me like medicine,

542
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:35,630
you know, he tasted really bad, but he
knew it was good for him. So, you know,

543
00:34:35,631 --> 00:34:40,210
he just closed his eyes and opened his
mouth and swallowed to get it done. And,

544
00:34:40,211 --> 00:34:41,960
and really to keep,
um,

545
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:46,940
because I think he knew deep in his
heart that what I was trying to do was,

546
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:50,810
you know, make a great film
with him and, uh, and then,

547
00:34:50,811 --> 00:34:54,380
and then he rose to it and he brought
it and bring it. But, you know,

548
00:34:54,381 --> 00:34:55,970
he talks about that meeting,
you know,

549
00:34:55,971 --> 00:34:59,270
like the little skinny punk coming to
him in pointing his little stubby finger

550
00:34:59,271 --> 00:35:01,070
in his face, which I love. I, it's funny,

551
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,220
I wish I was that tough
and that straight bode.

552
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:08,070
I'm sure I was more cordial and
polite to them because I was, um,

553
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,990
I know I was in awe of him
and excited to meet him. Um,

554
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:15,680
but I just wanted to be clear that like,
look, you know, if we're going to do this,

555
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:19,820
we were going to do this. Let's roll
up our sleeves and go for it. Um,

556
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:23,570
because it's just, for
me, filmmaking is so hard.

557
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:28,730
Um, I, I think for a lot of people there's
just so many challenges. It's like,

558
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:33,650
you know, literally every single film
I've done has been like, it's own IPO.

559
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:36,800
It's a, its own corporation. You
know, I start off with an idea.

560
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,560
I have attract talent and
money to come together. Um,

561
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,690
yes there's a formula,

562
00:35:42,691 --> 00:35:47,220
but I generally are making things that
don't quite fit into the widget factory.

563
00:35:47,221 --> 00:35:50,750
They're are a little weird and stuff,
so I don't think they fit in the region.

564
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,620
So we have to,
you know,

565
00:35:52,621 --> 00:35:56,130
I have to convince people why it's
going to be a widget and then we have to

566
00:35:56,131 --> 00:35:58,950
raise the money and hopefully,
you know, make it and get the,

567
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:02,940
get the investors' monies back. And you
know, I'm five or six, which isn't bad,

568
00:36:02,941 --> 00:36:05,670
but you know, each time it's, it's a real,

569
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:09,210
it's a lot of work. So, um,

570
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:14,820
you wanna make the whole process of it
for all the artists working with you as

571
00:36:14,821 --> 00:36:17,520
easy as possible. It's not really
where you want to put your fighting.

572
00:36:17,521 --> 00:36:21,150
You want to do the fighting for the
world and the money and all that.

573
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:25,740
Let's say you're making a new film and
you're working with some one who you

574
00:36:25,741 --> 00:36:27,690
respect,
just to depersonalize it a little bit.

575
00:36:27,691 --> 00:36:30,330
All that you could give a real example.
Let's say like Mickey,

576
00:36:30,331 --> 00:36:34,980
someone you really admire
who has a reputation for
being very strong willed and

577
00:36:34,981 --> 00:36:36,780
you're going to have this conversation
and you're going to have this

578
00:36:36,781 --> 00:36:40,710
conversation again. Yeah. How do you,
how do you open it? Like what is the,

579
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:45,470
what are some of the phrases that you
use to prevent it from blowing up or to,

580
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:49,230
uh, to try to allow it to go? Well,
of course. I mean, look, I mean,

581
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:54,060
I've never done a situation
where I'm asking someone, hey,

582
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:57,150
we're going to waterboard you for
three months. Yeah. I mean, um,

583
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:02,540
we're trying to do something that's
exciting and hopefully beautiful and you

584
00:37:02,761 --> 00:37:07,320
know, you know, striving to make art.
So that's the underlining agreement.

585
00:37:07,321 --> 00:37:10,470
So you're walking into that
conversation, Hey, I dig you, you dig me,

586
00:37:10,471 --> 00:37:13,110
let's try to make this work.
But just to be clear,

587
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:17,460
these are some of the things that are
going to be going on that will probably

588
00:37:17,461 --> 00:37:21,570
make you feel uncomfortable. And what
would be some examples of this? You know?

589
00:37:21,571 --> 00:37:24,400
Well, I mean a lot of very clear
example would be, you know,

590
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,910
when working with women,
if there's things that,

591
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:30,990
or men with those things that
are sexual in nature, you know,

592
00:37:30,991 --> 00:37:33,960
what's required nudity wise
and all that type of stuff.

593
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:37,590
And you have to talk about that beforehand
because of course it's very sensitive

594
00:37:37,591 --> 00:37:41,610
material and you want everyone to be
comfortable and very clear on why you're

595
00:37:41,611 --> 00:37:44,400
doing something. You know, anytime
you do like a love making scene,

596
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:48,270
what exactly is it going to be and why?
And I've never really,

597
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:53,220
I've never done a love making scene to
sort of make it sort of an erotic thing

598
00:37:53,221 --> 00:37:57,360
for an audience. I, I always
try to tie it in narratively.

599
00:37:57,630 --> 00:38:00,720
So I tell them very clearly
where the camera's going to be,

600
00:38:00,721 --> 00:38:04,680
what we're going to do, how we're
going to run the set, stuff like that.

601
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,710
Same thing with violence.
Violence, I think is,

602
00:38:07,711 --> 00:38:12,060
I'm just as important and the other way
of, you know what we're going to be,

603
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:14,670
how we're going to be
demonstrating violence, how are
we going to show it? I mean,

604
00:38:14,671 --> 00:38:19,380
for me that's, that's a huge
pet peeve because I, I feel
in this country, you know,

605
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:21,390
sexuality and violence has flipped,

606
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:25,560
especially in the movies where you can
have as much violence as you want an a Pg,

607
00:38:25,561 --> 00:38:26,790
PG 13 movie,

608
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:30,720
but you can't have an ounce of
sexuality and a Pg or PG 13 movie.

609
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:35,950
And that to me is, it's disgusting. I
don't have words to, to go beyond that.

610
00:38:35,951 --> 00:38:40,951
The fact that we're training our kids to
fire guns at such a young age with nerf

611
00:38:42,431 --> 00:38:44,110
guns and video games,

612
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:49,470
it's disgusting and disturbing while you
know any form of like saying there's a

613
00:38:50,231 --> 00:38:54,160
beauty in human connection,
physical connection that no,

614
00:38:54,161 --> 00:38:55,360
we can't talk about that.

615
00:38:55,660 --> 00:39:00,660
And the fact that the NPA sort of
reinforces that and that's what I mean,

616
00:39:01,331 --> 00:39:06,280
you know, I mean here I'll
go off, but like guns in ads,
I'll walk down the street.

617
00:39:06,281 --> 00:39:10,360
We not, my kid was five, six years old
and my kids pointing I huge, crazy,

618
00:39:10,361 --> 00:39:13,900
sexy looking machine guns on the
biggest movie stars in the world.

619
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:19,480
It's discussing the gun companies again,
free ads and you know,

620
00:39:19,481 --> 00:39:23,680
yet you can't show someone kissing,
you know?

621
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:27,160
So there's a whole sort of bend with that.
I don't know how I got it

622
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:31,770
there. I got it. Sorry. Sorry.
I don't know how I get to
where I go half the time.

623
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:35,320
Want to talk a little bit
about the word Catharsis?

624
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,680
I recently saw a union film.

625
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:44,440
I really enjoyed the experience
and came away. I told you this for,

626
00:39:44,441 --> 00:39:49,020
for a full day afterwards was in
this dream like state wonderful.

627
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:53,220
Which I savored and I had to,

628
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:56,870
I had a lot of questions and sometimes I,

629
00:39:57,090 --> 00:40:01,660
I feel like we will actually Milan
Kundera I think said that, you know, the,

630
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:06,680
the stupidity of man is that he has
all the answers and the intelligence or

631
00:40:06,781 --> 00:40:09,690
beauty of a novel is that it
has a question for everything.
Something like that.

632
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:10,270
Well,
that's interesting.

633
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:13,380
I'm paraphrasing and this is in his
book of laughter and forgetting,

634
00:40:13,381 --> 00:40:18,381
but at one point I recall reading that
you didn't intend people to have to find

635
00:40:20,731 --> 00:40:22,490
catharsis in your movies. You know, they,

636
00:40:22,491 --> 00:40:24,660
they expect to have
happy endings and so on,

637
00:40:24,661 --> 00:40:29,010
but that perhaps the catharsis
comes the day after seeing the film.

638
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:34,910
What do you want the experience of your
audience to be or what do you want them

639
00:40:35,311 --> 00:40:37,650
to take away from any one of your films?

640
00:40:37,651 --> 00:40:40,620
You could give a concrete example or just
in general something that drives you?

641
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:41,790
Well,

642
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:43,700
I guess I start off with,
you know,

643
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:47,740
the first rule of film making is
never to bore an audience. Um,

644
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:49,290
that to me is,

645
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:53,310
is the worst feeling and experience
when I'm watching a movie and my mind is

646
00:40:53,311 --> 00:40:57,000
wandering and maybe looking at the
colors splattered across the screen.

647
00:40:57,930 --> 00:41:01,710
I think you always want to engage
an audience, not just visually,

648
00:41:01,711 --> 00:41:03,990
not just through sound,
but emotionally.

649
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:08,170
So I think that's rule one is just
to give people and engaging emotional

650
00:41:08,171 --> 00:41:11,710
experience for two hours,
whatever your running time is.

651
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:13,660
And then I think,
uh,

652
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:18,680
on top of that you can hopefully layer
in some ideas so that when people leave

653
00:41:19,451 --> 00:41:23,020
the theater, it's not like,
you know, 15 minutes later,

654
00:41:23,021 --> 00:41:24,910
what did we watch?
You know,

655
00:41:24,911 --> 00:41:28,060
I don't want to be the Mcdonald's of
movies where the rapper, you know,

656
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:32,800
it's just the wrapper is all that's left
over. I want people to be, you know,

657
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,510
thinking a bit about and talking about it.
For me,

658
00:41:35,511 --> 00:41:40,511
one of my best life experiences was just
randomly I walked into a coffee shop

659
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,420
and it happened to be around the corner
from where pie was playing in la at the

660
00:41:44,421 --> 00:41:47,050
new art.
And a dad came in with the,

661
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:51,080
his 18 year old daughter and two of
her friends and the four of them were

662
00:41:51,081 --> 00:41:54,530
sitting there just talking about this
black and white movie that they had just

663
00:41:54,531 --> 00:41:57,140
seen. And I just kind
of bs dropped, you know,

664
00:41:57,141 --> 00:42:01,670
listening to him just thrilled that
there was a conversation and a debate and

665
00:42:01,671 --> 00:42:04,010
what did that mean and what did that mean?
And you know,

666
00:42:04,011 --> 00:42:07,910
for me that's always been the films
I love is, you know, yes, you know,

667
00:42:07,911 --> 00:42:11,930
there are movies that you have a great
experience in and enjoy and it's just a

668
00:42:11,931 --> 00:42:16,310
great pleasure to watch and
a great experience. But I
also liked the ones that,

669
00:42:16,311 --> 00:42:17,630
you know, um, you know,

670
00:42:17,631 --> 00:42:22,100
make you scratch your head and you think
about your talk and you debate because

671
00:42:22,101 --> 00:42:25,040
uh, you know, you want to
kind of have an impact.

672
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:30,070
And I think in today's landscape a lot
of things are disposable and it's really,

673
00:42:30,591 --> 00:42:33,440
really quick how disposable
they are because of how quick,

674
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:37,580
how much stuff we're being bombarded
with day after day after day.

675
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:38,853
Um,

676
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:43,220
it's nice to sorta hopefully
have something that reflects
back on it and thinks

677
00:42:43,221 --> 00:42:46,100
about it. You mentioned
emotional thinking that said,

678
00:42:46,101 --> 00:42:49,550
emotional connection or engagement.
What are the,

679
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:53,090
what are some of the ingredients
that helped to create that?

680
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:58,250
Because most films fail the eye
I think anyway. Yeah, I mean,

681
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,830
I mean it starts with the greatest,

682
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,900
I think the greatest invention of
the 20th century that's overlooked,

683
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,120
which is the close up and that,

684
00:43:06,121 --> 00:43:09,620
that's the great thing about cinema is
the fact that you can stick a camera

685
00:43:09,621 --> 00:43:11,540
right in the face of
Paul Newman, right? And,

686
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:15,110
and those beautiful blue eyes and
you can go right into his soul.

687
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:19,400
And then when you project it months
later to an audience or years later,

688
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:24,770
potentially centuries later,
you are anonymous and that audience,

689
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,160
yet you can feel the
empathy because in reality,

690
00:43:28,161 --> 00:43:31,610
two people talking and hanging out.
How much eye contact do you make?

691
00:43:31,611 --> 00:43:34,880
There's lots of other things going on
in this room that you're taking in that

692
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:38,360
act conditioner rattling my
guys mixing in the other room.

693
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:41,960
But the actual connection with another
human being where you are really looking

694
00:43:41,961 --> 00:43:44,000
into their soul and not
thinking about yourself.

695
00:43:44,001 --> 00:43:46,040
Cause the thing is when I look
at you and you look at me,

696
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,520
we're thinking a little bit about,
well now I'm making really a calm,

697
00:43:49,521 --> 00:43:52,970
comfortable us looking at each other and
we will, we're going to be looking away.

698
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:58,210
But in a movie and via the close up
you can be unconscious and fully be in.

699
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:01,640
Paul Newman said, even though you
don't know exactly what he's thinking,

700
00:44:01,641 --> 00:44:05,090
you can sort of study him and steel
and steel that thought. And that's,

701
00:44:05,450 --> 00:44:08,420
that to me is the great
greatness of cinema. Um,

702
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:12,260
or one of the great things
about cinema. And so, um,

703
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:14,630
and that's where you get emotion.
You know,

704
00:44:14,631 --> 00:44:17,810
and what happens is if you start
linking different emotions together,

705
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:20,530
hopefully you start to tell a story.
It store,

706
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:25,430
what the story does is it expands
the emotion. Just like a joke,

707
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:27,650
you know, set up, set up,
set up, pay off, you know,

708
00:44:27,651 --> 00:44:30,110
that's the classic structure of a joke.

709
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:34,170
It's the same thing with drama or you're
setting up a character and building

710
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:34,621
character.

711
00:44:34,621 --> 00:44:37,500
You give them a challenge and then you
see them go through that challenge and

712
00:44:37,501 --> 00:44:37,981
pay off.

713
00:44:37,981 --> 00:44:41,700
And then there's always the pitfall when
it all falls apart and then they rise

714
00:44:41,701 --> 00:44:46,320
up. And at that hero's
journey, you know, is just so,

715
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:49,830
I don't know if it's genetic, I don't
know if it's part of the human condition.

716
00:44:49,831 --> 00:44:52,560
I don't know if it's something that we,
we're taught very,

717
00:44:52,561 --> 00:44:56,040
very young and our first
doctor Seuss books. Um,

718
00:44:56,070 --> 00:45:01,070
but it's something that we all around
the planet and every language and every

719
00:45:02,251 --> 00:45:06,870
culture can relate to. I mean, for
me, the power of storytelling happen.

720
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:07,920
I was,
um,

721
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:12,600
I graduated high school
early and backpacked around
Europe and the Middle East

722
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:17,850
and uh, I ended up in the,
the Gemma in Marrakesh.

723
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:19,700
I don't know if you've been there,
but it's a,

724
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:23,930
it's amazing square in the middle of
the suck, you know, whether I'll um,

725
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:27,300
where they have all the
shops and stuff and uh,

726
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:31,860
at nighttime they ha it's
filled with snake charmers
and food and all this stuff.

727
00:45:31,861 --> 00:45:36,861
And there was one old guy leaning on a
cane and a beard telling a story and he

728
00:45:37,171 --> 00:45:41,160
had a huge crowd around them and it was
all in Arabic and I didn't understand

729
00:45:41,161 --> 00:45:44,850
the freaking word,
but I was mesmerized and I was like,

730
00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:46,350
that's what I want to do.

731
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:50,730
I want to tell stories because
that little old trivial,

732
00:45:50,731 --> 00:45:55,731
the old guy on a cane was transforming
himself into this 20 foot beast and I

733
00:45:57,421 --> 00:46:00,930
didn't even understand the language.
And I was like, that's cool, you know,

734
00:46:00,931 --> 00:46:03,810
to entertain a crowd with a point of view.

735
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:09,620
Where was that experience
relative to your time in Kenya?

736
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:12,270
But that was after Kenya.

737
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:15,330
I'm also on the board of directors for
an organization called the school for

738
00:46:15,331 --> 00:46:18,930
Field Studies, which is a great
organization out of Salem, Massachusetts,

739
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:23,450
which basically trains
mostly college students, uh,

740
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:25,680
to go abroad and,
uh,

741
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:29,970
into sensitive environmental areas
and do environmental studies.

742
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:34,620
And when I was a, I
dunno, a young teenager,

743
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:37,350
I worked at New York City
aquarium in Coney island,

744
00:46:37,351 --> 00:46:40,710
which was right next to my
neighborhood in Brooklyn. And the,

745
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:44,130
one of the big perks of that job
besides being at the aquarium,

746
00:46:44,131 --> 00:46:45,720
was that if you wore
the aquarium tee shirt,

747
00:46:45,721 --> 00:46:50,310
you got to go on the site clone roller
coaster over and over again. Um,

748
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:55,320
so we used to go 40, 50 times in a
row on the side, you know, and um,

749
00:46:55,410 --> 00:46:59,760
but I picked up a book for the School
for field studies there and they,

750
00:46:59,761 --> 00:47:02,190
it was just this little color
catalog and I was like, wow.

751
00:47:02,191 --> 00:47:06,750
They sent kids to Kenya and I was
like, Ma, this is what I want to do,

752
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:10,770
dad. You know. And somehow they took
a few high school students and I was,

753
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:14,130
I was like in events, the
biology. So I had a little bit,

754
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:17,130
I was always good inside and
my dad was a science teacher,

755
00:47:17,131 --> 00:47:20,250
so I was always pointed
in that direction a bit.

756
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:23,970
And so I got them to let
me go to Kenya where I, um,

757
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:28,860
I did what I study. I study thermo,
thermo regulate, no, I studied, um,

758
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:33,700
water strategies and ungulates the
next year I went to Alaska with them to

759
00:47:33,701 --> 00:47:36,640
Prince William sound actually
with a big x on spill was,

760
00:47:36,641 --> 00:47:38,140
but I was there two years before that,

761
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:42,400
which was fascinating because the research
we did there actually they use that

762
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:46,930
research after the, after the
spill to see what the impact was.

763
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:50,590
But in Alaska I studied
thermoregulation and harbor seals.

764
00:47:50,830 --> 00:47:55,830
I just like to say these words cause
Sir fancy sounding ungulates now tell us

765
00:47:56,411 --> 00:47:58,390
what fall into the class of ungulates are.

766
00:47:58,391 --> 00:48:02,200
They're all animals that stand on their
hooves. Got It. So everything from cattle,

767
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:06,850
uh, you know, domesticated
cattle to Zebra Gazelle,

768
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:11,430
um, will be, yeah, there
were no deer elk. I,

769
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:15,220
there might've been some elk in some
type of elk there, but um, yeah,

770
00:48:15,221 --> 00:48:17,850
so it's all that's true. Right. I
guess there would be Caribou in Alaska.

771
00:48:17,851 --> 00:48:20,800
It was interesting. We basically
were there, we were on this,

772
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:24,550
we were on this ranch owned
by an Afrikaner who wanted to,

773
00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:29,850
he did this thing called preservation for
profit was his idea where basically he

774
00:48:30,071 --> 00:48:34,000
was like, look, during a
drought, all the cattle die.

775
00:48:34,930 --> 00:48:39,930
But indigenous animals of course don't
die because they basically forage in the

776
00:48:41,230 --> 00:48:44,800
morning when there's dew on the leaves
and then the mid afternoon they're in the

777
00:48:44,801 --> 00:48:45,634
shade.

778
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:50,650
So Ba basically what we were there to
do is to prove his idea that indigenous

779
00:48:50,651 --> 00:48:54,130
animals were better adapted to the
environment. Then domesticated animals,

780
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:58,120
which is completely obvious, but in
science you have to sort of prove it.

781
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:02,890
So we studied them morphologically,
which was biologically when they,

782
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:06,670
and then we also looked at them and
their behavior patterns during the day.

783
00:49:07,330 --> 00:49:11,650
And I mean it was, it was fascinating
because basically we just use this,

784
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:11,950
you know,

785
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:15,880
I learned the scientific method and
we did real serious research and real

786
00:49:15,881 --> 00:49:18,460
charting and real, you know, and it,

787
00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:21,580
the next year was Alaska when
I went to Prince William Sound.

788
00:49:21,581 --> 00:49:24,040
And the beauty of that was the textbook.

789
00:49:24,041 --> 00:49:28,150
The only textbook we had was origin sbcs.
And each,

790
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:32,410
every two days we had a read
another chapter of origin
of species and discuss it.

791
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:37,150
And over the six, seven weeks I was
out in the bush. That was the whole,

792
00:49:37,570 --> 00:49:41,650
the whole class.
I had read that your time,

793
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:46,420
as soon as acting as a field biologist
are doing field biology in Kenya changed

794
00:49:46,421 --> 00:49:48,610
how you looked at the world. Now I
don't want to put words in your mouth,

795
00:49:48,611 --> 00:49:51,060
so I don't know if that's accurate
or not, but if that is true, yeah.

796
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:55,090
How did it change how
you looked at things?

797
00:49:55,270 --> 00:49:57,250
Everything changes your life all the time.
Right?

798
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:02,300
But back at that age when you're 16 and
you're a Brooklyn kid from New York City

799
00:50:02,651 --> 00:50:04,760
who's basically, you know, you know,

800
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:08,810
concrete jungle flee and
you've suddenly in, you know,

801
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:12,520
the Savanna of Kenya,
of course it's gonna Change Your Life.

802
00:50:12,521 --> 00:50:15,070
So it's a little bit of an
overstatement I think. But um,

803
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:19,330
I mean every day was mind blowing.
I, as an embarrassing moment,

804
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,550
I was 16 so you have to forgive me.

805
00:50:22,030 --> 00:50:25,570
I got off the plane and I was riding
with the professors to the thing.

806
00:50:25,570 --> 00:50:28,070
I was like, Oh, when are we
gonna See Tigers? They're like,

807
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:32,060
there aren't any tigers in
Africa. They're in Asia. Oh,

808
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:39,230
that's what I meant. So I, you know, a kid
from Brooklyn, no idea what was going on.

809
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:39,711
So I mean,

810
00:50:39,711 --> 00:50:44,660
every day it was just every day literally
was something I had never seen before.

811
00:50:44,661 --> 00:50:47,060
And now in Alaska,
and you know,

812
00:50:47,061 --> 00:50:51,020
this is a pre Google pre crazy media age,
you know,

813
00:50:51,021 --> 00:50:55,850
still only 11 channels on the station
at the couple of people had cable,

814
00:50:55,851 --> 00:51:00,210
but early days of civilization.
And um,

815
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:03,350
I remember we were kayaking.
It was an amazing trip.

816
00:51:03,351 --> 00:51:07,010
It was like five weeks in kayaks
out in Prince William Sound,

817
00:51:07,011 --> 00:51:12,011
one of the most untouched places on the
planet at that point until Exxon showed

818
00:51:12,261 --> 00:51:14,760
up.
And we can,

819
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,630
we were going to this glacier
and I had never seen a glacier.

820
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:20,090
Now everyone's seen a glacier
at this point because of that,

821
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:22,670
the calving ice and what's
happening to the glaciers.

822
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:28,150
But the idea of blue ice for a kid
from Brooklyn and they're like this

823
00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:32,900
[inaudible] glacier. When the first time
I saw it, it was like two miles long,

824
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:37,340
you know, half a mile
tall. I mean, I just,

825
00:51:37,341 --> 00:51:42,341
with huge chunks of ice falling and
you'd see the chunks fall off and then a

826
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:46,430
minute later you'd hear the sound because
of the distance, like at a ballpark.

827
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:51,200
And then these huge waves from that start
coming at you and you're in a kayak.

828
00:51:51,201 --> 00:51:52,250
So you really close to water.

829
00:51:52,251 --> 00:51:56,780
And on those waves are icebergs with
seals hauled out regulating their

830
00:51:56,781 --> 00:52:00,020
temperature on it, going
up and down. I mean,

831
00:52:00,290 --> 00:52:02,960
just like who needs psychedelics?

832
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:10,890
You've been called controversial. I don't
know if you view yourself that way. Um,

833
00:52:11,050 --> 00:52:16,050
but I'd love to talk a little bit about
how to respond to public perception and

834
00:52:17,771 --> 00:52:21,000
criticism. Another mutual
friend of ours, Rick Ruben,

835
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:26,280
fantastic guy, uh, incredible
music producer, uh,

836
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:31,020
among other greatest. Yeah, he is. He
said on this podcast, he said, the best,

837
00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:34,590
the best art, I'm paraphrasing, but
the best art divides the audience.

838
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:40,080
And so I think it was, uh, help me
out here. I think it was variety.

839
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,390
The day after you got a 30
minute standing ovation,

840
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:48,030
said you should quit filmmaking
and go therapy instead. And, uh,

841
00:52:48,210 --> 00:52:51,720
you've had as anybody
who's in the public arena,

842
00:52:52,890 --> 00:52:57,090
uh, has, uh, a fair amount of say,

843
00:52:57,091 --> 00:52:58,720
criticism of various types.
Yeah.

844
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:04,230
What would your advice be to a
filmmaker you think is very promising?

845
00:53:04,231 --> 00:53:06,420
Who's doing something that is not,

846
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:09,110
that doesn't fit cleanly in
the widget factory? Yeah.

847
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:12,120
They're probably gonna catch fire,
but they haven't had the experience.

848
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:16,630
What would you say to a person that's
an easy answer? Keep going. You know,

849
00:53:16,631 --> 00:53:20,800
that's what you want. I mean, I, when
I meet, uh, when I teach are like my,

850
00:53:20,801 --> 00:53:24,730
both my parents were teachers and so I,
I, it's in the blood and I love teaching.

851
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:25,740
You know,

852
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:29,640
the thing I try to instill in students
is like the only thing you have to offer

853
00:53:29,641 --> 00:53:33,660
as you, you know, your individual
stories, your individual perception,

854
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:35,490
your individual humanity,

855
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:39,270
and figuring out a way to
communicate that humanity to the,

856
00:53:39,390 --> 00:53:42,120
to humanity at large. I mean, that's
the beauty of cinema, once again,

857
00:53:42,121 --> 00:53:46,500
that you can have a six year old Iranian
girl, our 90 year old British gentlemen,

858
00:53:47,070 --> 00:53:51,870
and you can have an equal emotional
experience if the filmmaker does their job

859
00:53:51,871 --> 00:53:56,370
right to it. So like for me it would be,
you know, a ballerina and a wrestler,

860
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:00,510
hopefully. Can I make you feel and
their blood in their pain. That's,

861
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:03,630
that's the goal. Um,
because that's, you know,

862
00:54:03,631 --> 00:54:05,730
that that's one of the
great things cinema does,

863
00:54:05,731 --> 00:54:09,480
is to bring us into other human
experiences. So if you're,

864
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:14,540
if it's truthful to who you are and you're
concerned about how people are going

865
00:54:14,930 --> 00:54:16,110
to react to it,
you know,

866
00:54:16,111 --> 00:54:20,730
stick up your middle finger and charge
straight into that fire, you have to, um,

867
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:24,930
if you're trying to be a provocateur,
just to be a provocateur, you know,

868
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:26,880
go f yourself. You know, that to me is,

869
00:54:26,910 --> 00:54:30,460
that's the bad stuff is
like when it's not real. Um,

870
00:54:31,110 --> 00:54:35,730
so for me it's not, it's
never like, oh shit, how do
I, you know, mess around with,

871
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:39,600
that's not why I make movies at all.
I,

872
00:54:39,601 --> 00:54:43,170
I'm just juiced about these
ideas. And um, they had,

873
00:54:43,171 --> 00:54:46,920
they have nothing about
being confrontational. But
even when I do a film, like,

874
00:54:46,921 --> 00:54:51,300
you know, you know, the fountains
been called a love poem to death.

875
00:54:51,570 --> 00:54:55,950
I piss people off even though it's just
really gentle move romantic movie about

876
00:54:55,951 --> 00:54:57,480
a guy coming to terms with dying.

877
00:54:58,050 --> 00:55:01,970
I guess that's just not a very commercial
idea in the west. But you know, I,

878
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,980
I thought it was at the time
and I was like, you know,

879
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:08,380
dancing around for five years
telling studios I was going to it,

880
00:55:08,490 --> 00:55:11,490
that people would be interested in the
movie. And because I really believed it,

881
00:55:11,491 --> 00:55:13,950
I wasn't, I'm not interested, you know,

882
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:19,590
I happened to be a filmmaker who
wants to talk to audiences. I love it.

883
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:20,880
I love when they respond.

884
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:25,050
Unfortunately I haven't done a
comedy or something that's easy,

885
00:55:25,051 --> 00:55:29,040
quite yet easier to connect with an
audience on, easier to make by any means.

886
00:55:29,041 --> 00:55:31,230
But I just mean,
you know when you're going to,

887
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:33,240
when you're aiming the please annoyance,

888
00:55:33,241 --> 00:55:36,510
it's a lot easier to make it then when
you're just making something that you

889
00:55:36,511 --> 00:55:40,530
feel inside.
And for me it's not a conscious thing.

890
00:55:40,531 --> 00:55:45,090
It's purely from my gut. That's the core
for me. It comes from my stomach always.

891
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:47,990
It's not the heart, it's mostly
where it might be somewhere between,

892
00:55:48,090 --> 00:55:51,630
I don't know what's right
here, solar plexus. It's right
beneath the solar plexus.

893
00:55:51,631 --> 00:55:55,380
It's kind of this stomach, I guess
like your large intestine. Oh Great.

894
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:01,880
Let's play this die there.
It's that, that area,

895
00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:04,950
when I feel when I'm writing and
it's like coming out of there,

896
00:56:04,951 --> 00:56:08,520
I know it's like some type
of Chana g from there. Si.

897
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:10,410
Do you pay a lot of attention?

898
00:56:10,411 --> 00:56:14,370
Does your kinesthetic response to
what you're doing when you're writing?

899
00:56:15,890 --> 00:56:19,800
I mean you, it's that unconscious state
where you're not feeling body. That's the,

900
00:56:19,830 --> 00:56:24,610
that's the state to get into where
just coming of you, you know.

901
00:56:24,611 --> 00:56:28,990
And, and that it's not by,
by no means is that often.

902
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:32,850
You know, I, I believe there
are writers out there. Um,

903
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:37,910
I was very, I know some real
writers and I think they are,

904
00:56:37,911 --> 00:56:41,710
I get into that state a lot
easier and I'm not a real writer,

905
00:56:41,711 --> 00:56:45,630
but sometimes I have ideas and that I
want to get out and express and so I,

906
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:48,550
I tried to do it.
Why do you say you're not a real writer?

907
00:56:49,630 --> 00:56:54,090
People who would argue that
you have writing credits? I
don't know. I mean I just,

908
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:58,960
I guess I, I'm in awe of, I have,
I have some friends that really,

909
00:56:58,961 --> 00:57:03,040
right. And I see the way they can put
words together. I don't, you know,

910
00:57:03,190 --> 00:57:07,940
look the reality, I'm being more truthful
with Ferris then I've been with him,

911
00:57:07,990 --> 00:57:08,823
probably anyone.

912
00:57:09,910 --> 00:57:13,370
The reality is I was a public
school kid from Brooklyn and I,

913
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:16,450
they never really taught me how to write.
And when I got to college,

914
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:21,880
I went into the creative writing class
and I almost flunked out of it because I

915
00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:25,900
really did not know how to write an essay.
I didn't even, I, I to this day, my,

916
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:26,681
my son,

917
00:57:26,681 --> 00:57:30,700
my 11 year old son knows more about
pronouns and nouns and sentence structure.

918
00:57:30,701 --> 00:57:34,300
I just never learned grammar. It was
never talked to me and, and then,

919
00:57:34,330 --> 00:57:37,990
and it was a shame. I just
never, I never did the Romeo,

920
00:57:37,991 --> 00:57:41,440
so I probably have some type of security
about that cause I don't think I could

921
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:45,400
write that. I can write dialogue
because I have an ear and, and I,

922
00:57:45,401 --> 00:57:49,600
and I do have some ideas that I can try
to sketch out, but I don't really, um,

923
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:51,880
you know,
I guess I'm scared of,

924
00:57:51,970 --> 00:57:53,920
I'm scared you're going to
give me an essay to write

925
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:57,760
challenging one. I'm going, going
to be the last person he did.

926
00:57:57,761 --> 00:58:02,470
He just say it right. My, my, uh,
writing my senior thesis in college,

927
00:58:02,471 --> 00:58:06,730
which is mandatory and it constitutes a
huge part of your departmental grade for

928
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,060
the entire time that you were at school.
Yeah,

929
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:15,610
traumatize me so much that I
pledged to myself when I graduated.

930
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:18,500
I would never write anything
longer than an email ever again.

931
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:23,300
Clearly did not work out. Uh, it worked
out, but it didn't work out as planned.

932
00:58:23,301 --> 00:58:28,301
I guess thesis on my thesis was on the
phonetic and semantic acquisition of

933
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:34,490
Chinese characters in
the Japanese language.

934
00:58:34,491 --> 00:58:36,770
It's called [inaudible] by
native English speakers.

935
00:58:37,130 --> 00:58:41,910
So how do native English speakers most
effectively acquire both the meaning and

936
00:58:41,911 --> 00:58:46,290
pronunciation of Chinese
characters? Um, unbelievable. Yeah.

937
00:58:46,530 --> 00:58:47,420
In retrospect,

938
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:50,970
it doesn't seem like someone who's afraid
of writing would write something like

939
00:58:50,971 --> 00:58:54,030
that. That's pretty, you know, I had,

940
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:58,890
I had a lot of my true interests were
buried in some of these early writing

941
00:58:58,891 --> 00:59:03,891
projects or even scientific assignments
that I then felt were trivial or not

942
00:59:06,391 --> 00:59:10,140
serious for some reason. And now I'm
coming back to them 20 years later.

943
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,110
I'm amazing.
I mean,

944
00:59:11,310 --> 00:59:15,630
I remember I took a neuroscience
class initially the plan was to be a

945
00:59:15,631 --> 00:59:16,510
neuroscience major.
Actually.

946
00:59:16,511 --> 00:59:20,070
It was a psychology major focusing on
neuroscience for a host of reasons.

947
00:59:20,071 --> 00:59:22,790
Move to the language,
namely principally,

948
00:59:22,791 --> 00:59:26,480
I couldn't do the animal testing that
was required to be part of the lab.

949
00:59:26,481 --> 00:59:30,200
I want it to be part of.
Yeah, I mean I, I will say,

950
00:59:30,230 --> 00:59:33,050
I mean I understand the
sensitivity of the subject.

951
00:59:33,051 --> 00:59:36,800
I do think some studies are very difficult
to do or impossible to do without

952
00:59:36,830 --> 00:59:39,920
certain animal modeling.
But let me just say that for instance,

953
00:59:39,921 --> 00:59:44,900
one of the studies, I've been deep
into this. No, I know you. I know you.

954
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:49,070
I don't want to own up for
environmental reasons. Just
Oh, for sure. I have a, well,

955
00:59:49,071 --> 00:59:51,950
we'll talk about it later. No, we can,
yeah, we can definitely talk about the,

956
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:53,720
but where I became,

957
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:58,780
I was really fascinated by
rem sleep and some of the sea,

958
00:59:59,390 --> 01:00:02,760
the physiological
similarities to state states.

959
01:00:02,761 --> 01:00:04,670
It can be induced with hallucinogens.
Oh Wow.

960
01:00:05,030 --> 01:00:10,030
And so this was probably my sophomore
year in college that I was really

961
01:00:10,131 --> 01:00:13,490
fascinated by this.
And it only took 20 years,

962
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,740
25 years to come back to it full circle.

963
01:00:15,770 --> 01:00:18,320
Did you ever try to stay
awake for a long time?

964
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:23,040
I stayed awake and this
is not advisable at all.

965
01:00:23,490 --> 01:00:26,840
I wanted to see what the
disclaimers, you know, because the I,

966
01:00:26,841 --> 01:00:30,890
every once in a while I'll get an email
from somebody's cousin [inaudible] he

967
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:33,890
said, and he gave himself a
headache. And I'm like, yeah,

968
01:00:33,891 --> 01:00:38,600
you got to use your common sense people.
But I stayed away for six days. Oh Wow.

969
01:00:38,990 --> 01:00:43,970
I wanted to see what would happen because
I had read these reports of people

970
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:48,470
having all sorts of odd phenomenon crop
up when you stay awake for that period

971
01:00:48,471 --> 01:00:53,380
of time. And uh, so I used a stimulants,

972
01:00:53,390 --> 01:00:54,770
nothing illegal,

973
01:00:55,190 --> 01:00:59,150
but it was very good at concocting putting
together these cocktails for myself

974
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:02,360
and stayed awake for five and a half,
six days.

975
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:07,280
I stopped because I was walking on campus.

976
01:01:07,281 --> 01:01:09,980
I remember very clearly
where I was. I was, I was,

977
01:01:10,430 --> 01:01:14,810
you would make it [inaudible] Hagen
and there were goblins everywhere.

978
01:01:15,460 --> 01:01:15,621
No,

979
01:01:15,621 --> 01:01:20,621
I fell asleep while I was walking and
woke up about a block later and I had

980
01:01:21,461 --> 01:01:23,930
crossed two or three. Oh Wow.
And I was like, you know what,

981
01:01:23,990 --> 01:01:27,290
this is no longer a good idea.
But you,

982
01:01:27,530 --> 01:01:30,590
have you stayed awake for a really
long period of time? No, I had a,

983
01:01:30,890 --> 01:01:34,940
there was a test when I was in Undergrad
and my roommate did it where he

984
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:39,170
basically was to stay awake
and he just became cruel.

985
01:01:39,290 --> 01:01:41,360
And I remember him telling me like
they, they were like, oh, he's like,

986
01:01:41,361 --> 01:01:42,710
I'm going to go to sleep to like,
don't go to sleep.

987
01:01:42,711 --> 01:01:46,640
So he took a deck of cards and start
throwing cards around the room and made

988
01:01:46,641 --> 01:01:49,250
everyone run around and pick them up.
Otherwise he would go to sleep.

989
01:01:49,251 --> 01:01:52,460
So he started doing like really
messing with the aids and the,

990
01:01:52,550 --> 01:01:55,070
and the Grad students that were
doing the studies on him. Yeah.

991
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:59,960
But of course the overnight or, and
those are important. Not just, you know,

992
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:03,590
when you're in college and stuff,
but I haven't, I'm glad you,

993
01:02:03,591 --> 01:02:07,110
you are out there exploring
it for us. Yeah. I don't, the,

994
01:02:07,111 --> 01:02:10,910
the conclusion is don't do that.
Inclusion is don't do that.

995
01:02:11,330 --> 01:02:14,720
And if you remove sleep and food from
people, they get really, really grumpy.

996
01:02:14,990 --> 01:02:16,070
It turns out,
uh,

997
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:20,550
this is a quote from New York magazine.

998
01:02:21,230 --> 01:02:24,980
This may have been from a while ago, uh,
on, I don't think it's that old actually.

999
01:02:24,981 --> 01:02:28,610
So I think when I was starting out as
a filmmaker, I had tremendous focus,

1000
01:02:28,611 --> 01:02:31,310
but I don't think I robbed
myself of too much life.

1001
01:02:32,060 --> 01:02:34,250
I'm still friends with the guys
who grew up with a nursery school.

1002
01:02:34,251 --> 01:02:35,630
I have a great relationship.
My family,

1003
01:02:35,631 --> 01:02:38,210
I'm definitely attracted
to balance to symmetry.

1004
01:02:38,211 --> 01:02:41,780
I'm definitely an order personality,
but I'm a lot less ordered than I was.

1005
01:02:42,620 --> 01:02:44,300
God Damn,
I said some stupid shit.

1006
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:49,700
So you can definitely deny you can
correct it and set the record straight.

1007
01:02:50,150 --> 01:02:55,150
But this is of incredible interest to me
because many people who would aspire to

1008
01:02:57,641 --> 01:03:02,641
be creative or who self describe as
creative burn themselves out or they

1009
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:07,930
sacrifice family relationships
by being singularly focused.

1010
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:12,160
And sometimes they're proud of it.
Sometimes they regret it. But this is,

1011
01:03:12,220 --> 01:03:15,100
this is something that
I don't hear very often.

1012
01:03:15,670 --> 01:03:19,600
So I was wondering if you could just
elaborate on that because how do you have,

1013
01:03:19,990 --> 01:03:24,990
how do you have the tremendous
focus required to do what
you've done while still

1014
01:03:27,250 --> 01:03:28,810
having that balance and symmetry?

1015
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:34,150
I mean, it is a balancing
act and you know, uh,

1016
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:39,200
but I think all the
time you put into life,

1017
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:40,921
you know,

1018
01:03:40,921 --> 01:03:45,921
and to family and to friends and
into activities outside of the work,

1019
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:51,960
you know,
back to our procrastinate.

1020
01:03:51,990 --> 01:03:54,480
Not to say what your
family is procrastination,

1021
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:59,960
but bringing in those other experiences
into your life is what makes you be able

1022
01:04:01,411 --> 01:04:05,400
to relate to people and to communicate.
And at least for filmmaking,

1023
01:04:05,401 --> 01:04:07,800
that's a major part is you know,

1024
01:04:08,430 --> 01:04:13,080
going to a diner with friends and seeing
an argument between some strangers over

1025
01:04:13,081 --> 01:04:16,110
there ends up in a
movie. For me, you know,

1026
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:21,030
living life and seeing stuff and doing
all different types of experiences

1027
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:25,290
through this planet is important to be
a storyteller because it's all about the

1028
01:04:25,291 --> 01:04:28,260
stories.
I mean I think the first three,

1029
01:04:28,270 --> 01:04:32,160
four films of my career and definitely
all my short films before that all came

1030
01:04:32,161 --> 01:04:35,450
out of very personal
experiences of my life. And,

1031
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:40,050
and the problem is if you keep working
nonstop and you're originating your

1032
01:04:40,051 --> 01:04:42,710
material, I think it's different
if you're more of a journey,

1033
01:04:42,711 --> 01:04:47,370
men who's going along and then just
taking your craft and bringing it to life,

1034
01:04:47,371 --> 01:04:49,370
bringing a great script to life.
Cause I think at the,

1035
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:52,680
you mean by that as a journeyman,
something that's not a personal story.

1036
01:04:53,190 --> 01:04:54,360
By nature.
I mean,

1037
01:04:54,361 --> 01:04:58,140
I think every stories personal or you
can find a personal way because anytime

1038
01:04:58,141 --> 01:05:00,150
you portray a character on screen,

1039
01:05:00,151 --> 01:05:03,680
you should sort of infuse them
with real emotions and stuff. So,

1040
01:05:03,681 --> 01:05:07,470
and to do that you have to
feel it yourself. But, um,

1041
01:05:08,310 --> 01:05:13,310
if you're drawing on your own life and
your own stories and you're somehow more

1042
01:05:13,651 --> 01:05:15,990
autobiographical somehow,
even through metaphor,

1043
01:05:15,991 --> 01:05:20,200
because I think all my films are
not about, I'm not a ballerina yet.

1044
01:05:20,830 --> 01:05:24,880
You know, there's a lot of Natalie
in me. I mean that character,

1045
01:05:24,881 --> 01:05:28,930
Nina and me, not Natalie, but Nina,
the character, I'm not a wrestler,

1046
01:05:28,931 --> 01:05:31,300
but Randy the Ram I,

1047
01:05:31,350 --> 01:05:35,500
I'm pretty connected to and I understand
why he makes every decision and some of

1048
01:05:35,501 --> 01:05:39,790
those stories in there I can relate to or,
or drawn from my own life.

1049
01:05:40,780 --> 01:05:43,800
So I think,
you know,

1050
01:05:43,810 --> 01:05:46,000
if it's an assignment
where you don't really,

1051
01:05:46,001 --> 01:05:49,090
you just showing up as a director
and you're there to, you know,

1052
01:05:49,091 --> 01:05:52,780
make all the departments work
together and make the actors do it.

1053
01:05:53,590 --> 01:05:57,250
I think it's the, it, it becomes,
it becomes more of a craft then,

1054
01:05:58,330 --> 01:05:59,800
not to say that it's not an art,

1055
01:05:59,830 --> 01:06:04,830
but I think if you're trying to create
your own stories that are coming out of

1056
01:06:05,171 --> 01:06:08,890
life, you have to actually live
life to do it, you know? Right.

1057
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:12,040
Otherwise you're just
getting your stories.

1058
01:06:12,041 --> 01:06:13,360
I don't know where you
could get your stories from.

1059
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:15,340
I guess you could make things
about being an obsessive film,

1060
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:18,430
which is kind of like, you know, one
of my favorite filmmakers, Fellini,

1061
01:06:18,431 --> 01:06:22,350
started making films about
directors, making films, you know,

1062
01:06:24,310 --> 01:06:25,810
I mean eventually went
off until the things,

1063
01:06:25,811 --> 01:06:29,930
but for a while that's what he worked on.
And so I think you,

1064
01:06:29,940 --> 01:06:33,490
you have to balance in this, in this art
form. It's, it's very different, I think,

1065
01:06:34,150 --> 01:06:34,791
uh,

1066
01:06:34,791 --> 01:06:39,670
in different forms because all the forms
can be expressed in different ways.

1067
01:06:39,671 --> 01:06:43,360
So I, I can't really speak for that,
but, but storytelling, you need stories.

1068
01:06:43,970 --> 01:06:47,380
Realize if something has told at
one point, which helped me at least,

1069
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:51,910
which was a friend of mine, a writer,
I think it was, it might've been,

1070
01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:55,470
it was either. Debbie Millman, I want to
say, or Maria Popova. And they said, uh,

1071
01:06:55,930 --> 01:06:59,470
if art imitates life,
you have to have a life.

1072
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:01,833
Right?

1073
01:07:01,870 --> 01:07:06,730
And I guess my followup question is when
you are really immersed in a project,

1074
01:07:06,731 --> 01:07:10,180
yeah.
And maybe maybe now with family and so on,

1075
01:07:10,181 --> 01:07:12,460
it's different than in the early days,
but

1076
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:17,830
my experience and part of the risk I
have when I go into a project is that it

1077
01:07:17,831 --> 01:07:21,580
tends to crowd out other things,
right?

1078
01:07:21,581 --> 01:07:26,581
You schedule say time with friends and
family so that they don't get displaced.

1079
01:07:28,061 --> 01:07:32,740
How do you ensure that that happens or
you just programmed in such a way that

1080
01:07:32,741 --> 01:07:37,660
it's natural? It's not a bad life
as a filmmaker because basically,

1081
01:07:37,690 --> 01:07:41,320
at least the way my,
my schedule is, I do a,

1082
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:45,970
a film every two, three years.
So in that two, three years,

1083
01:07:45,971 --> 01:07:48,040
there'll be like a 50 60 day Ron,

1084
01:07:48,041 --> 01:07:52,210
which will be completely selfish and
completely committed and dedicated to the

1085
01:07:52,211 --> 01:07:57,211
film where I'm working 1820
hour days over and over again.

1086
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:01,060
Insane amount of time.
And you know,

1087
01:08:01,061 --> 01:08:05,560
you get one day off on the weekend and
then the next day you probably prepping.

1088
01:08:05,890 --> 01:08:10,420
Um, although I'm able now to almost get
two days off because I've been doing it

1089
01:08:10,421 --> 01:08:15,421
enough that I kind of have more skills
but I can go in so can get a weekend off

1090
01:08:16,101 --> 01:08:20,510
sometimes. But where I can
spend with family and friends,

1091
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:23,270
not that I could go out
and party and have a beer,

1092
01:08:23,290 --> 01:08:26,330
I mean it's gotta be very mellow and
most of the time I'll just want to watch

1093
01:08:26,331 --> 01:08:31,220
game of Thrones. But that's
a huge marathon. That only
happens once every two,

1094
01:08:31,221 --> 01:08:35,510
three years. And then you get into editing
and it's basically a nine to five job.

1095
01:08:36,140 --> 01:08:37,760
You know,
there's always things coming up,

1096
01:08:37,761 --> 01:08:42,140
but it's a much slower pace and
that could be a 40 week process.

1097
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:44,330
Then you get to selling the film,
which is kind of a two,

1098
01:08:44,331 --> 01:08:46,640
three week kind of marathon of travel.

1099
01:08:46,670 --> 01:08:49,520
But it's kind of fun cause that's where
a lot of stories come from because you

1100
01:08:49,521 --> 01:08:53,420
see all these different cultures and
you just see a lot of crazy shit.

1101
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:56,990
So it's not that bad. And then,
and then I get into development.

1102
01:08:56,991 --> 01:09:00,290
And when I'm in development for
the next project, it's, once again,

1103
01:09:00,291 --> 01:09:05,030
I can really shape that around,
um, my son's schedule and, and,

1104
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:09,110
and I can have time to see my friends
and have experiences and travel and stuff

1105
01:09:09,111 --> 01:09:14,030
like that. Because when you're developing,
it's all virtual, virtual in your head,

1106
01:09:14,060 --> 01:09:18,800
not quite in a computer, but it's, it's
all in your imagination for a while.

1107
01:09:19,070 --> 01:09:21,710
And all you need is a notepad and
a pen and you can be anywhere.

1108
01:09:22,340 --> 01:09:25,160
Are there any particular resources,

1109
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:27,650
and I'm sure this is a question you've
had a lot, so I apologize in advance,

1110
01:09:27,651 --> 01:09:31,880
but I haven't heard the answer.
So to aspiring filmmakers,

1111
01:09:32,570 --> 01:09:36,860
uh, let's just assume intelligent, driven,

1112
01:09:36,980 --> 01:09:40,190
organized, so big assumption, but let's
just assume they check those three boxes.

1113
01:09:40,191 --> 01:09:40,850
Sure.

1114
01:09:40,850 --> 01:09:45,850
Are there any particular books
or resources or approaches
that you would suggest

1115
01:09:46,581 --> 01:09:47,900
they take?
Assuming that they're,

1116
01:09:47,930 --> 01:09:51,920
they want to put together some type of
narrative storytelling about doing a

1117
01:09:51,921 --> 01:09:56,390
document. I always push the writer's
journey by Christopher Vogler.

1118
01:09:56,660 --> 01:10:00,100
It's very good, but it's only for people
who are writing screenplays. So, but he,

1119
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:00,651
but he's great.

1120
01:10:00,651 --> 01:10:05,360
He basically took Joseph Campbell's work
and turned it into screenplay language

1121
01:10:05,361 --> 01:10:10,020
and he did a really good at job at it
and we're totally part of his cult. Uh,

1122
01:10:10,220 --> 01:10:12,740
cause we,
I believe in that hero's journey.

1123
01:10:13,260 --> 01:10:15,350
And not to say that's
the end all to end all.

1124
01:10:15,351 --> 01:10:18,230
And there are other ways to approach it.
But it's a very,

1125
01:10:18,231 --> 01:10:22,400
very interesting structure that can
really lead to big breakthroughs.

1126
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:23,390
When you're struggling,

1127
01:10:23,391 --> 01:10:26,540
you can look at the different
archetypes that there are and,

1128
01:10:26,541 --> 01:10:29,360
and often you find yourself
falling into it. And, and you know,

1129
01:10:29,870 --> 01:10:34,320
it's funny like requiem for a
dream. When I was working on it, I,

1130
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:38,120
it was before I read Vogler, but
now that I look back, I, I still,

1131
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:42,410
I was doing stuff similar where I was
charting out where their emotion was,

1132
01:10:42,411 --> 01:10:43,244
the characters.

1133
01:10:44,030 --> 01:10:47,840
And what was interesting is that the
graph was actually upside down when

1134
01:10:47,841 --> 01:10:50,360
something good was supposed to happen,
something bad was happening.

1135
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:55,130
And I was looking at it one day
I flipped it over and I said, oh,

1136
01:10:56,660 --> 01:11:01,100
they're actually the bad guys. All my
characters. The good guy is addiction.

1137
01:11:01,790 --> 01:11:06,260
And this is actually a hero's journey of
addiction, overcoming the human spirit.

1138
01:11:07,050 --> 01:11:12,050
That's when I finally understood what
the movie was about and charting it and

1139
01:11:12,081 --> 01:11:15,300
using hero's journey, how I was able
to figure out that, that id out,

1140
01:11:15,301 --> 01:11:17,950
that this invisible monster was a,

1141
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:22,140
of this craving was actually the hero
of the film. But that's great. I mean,

1142
01:11:22,470 --> 01:11:26,310
and then the other thing back on what
we talked about is, you know, tell,

1143
01:11:26,370 --> 01:11:27,240
tell your story.

1144
01:11:27,330 --> 01:11:32,330
Don't try to figure out what
people want because the reality is,

1145
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:36,540
you know, and I kind of learned this when
I, when I was coming out of film school,

1146
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:40,740
I went to support my friend Scott Silver,
who's a big screenwriter.

1147
01:11:40,770 --> 01:11:45,120
Now we have made a directed a film that
was at Sundance and it was the year that,

1148
01:11:45,121 --> 01:11:48,870
uh, welcomed the doll house was there
and a bunch of other indeed jams.

1149
01:11:48,871 --> 01:11:52,800
And I remember watching these films go,
these are such specific,

1150
01:11:52,801 --> 01:11:56,040
unique movies,
but they're done exquisitely well.

1151
01:11:56,970 --> 01:12:01,080
And what Sundance allowed me to believe
in what independent film has allowed so

1152
01:12:01,081 --> 01:12:03,870
many dreamers to believe
is that if you make a film,

1153
01:12:03,871 --> 01:12:07,110
well no matter how personal it is,

1154
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:10,260
if it's truthful,
you'll find an audience.

1155
01:12:10,670 --> 01:12:13,530
So not, not to invoke the
name of, of Rick again,

1156
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:15,610
but I was having a conversation with,

1157
01:12:15,611 --> 01:12:20,250
with rec recently in a barrel sauna
that as the exact replica of his barrel

1158
01:12:20,251 --> 01:12:21,084
sauna

1159
01:12:22,650 --> 01:12:27,370
and that we were talking about this
deadline that I continually, uh,

1160
01:12:27,540 --> 01:12:31,980
I'm actually working hard on the book,
but I, I spent a lot of time talking,

1161
01:12:32,730 --> 01:12:36,810
I spent a lot of time talking about how
hard I'm working on the book. And uh,

1162
01:12:37,590 --> 01:12:42,590
I was asking him some questions about
working with musicians and whether he

1163
01:12:44,311 --> 01:12:47,970
knows if something has hit the mark or
not. And uh, I'm going to paraphrase here,

1164
01:12:47,971 --> 01:12:52,750
but he said effectively great is
always better than now. And Oh,

1165
01:12:52,780 --> 01:12:56,850
that's interesting. And, and in the
way I interpreted that was, you know,

1166
01:12:56,851 --> 01:12:59,880
there's always a good time for great.
There's never a good time for mediocre.

1167
01:12:59,910 --> 01:13:02,280
So if you feel like you were rushed
to hit some kind of deadline,

1168
01:13:02,281 --> 01:13:06,580
obviously are realities of production and
so on. Don't get me wrong, but uh, yeah,

1169
01:13:06,990 --> 01:13:11,550
rush. You can't rush that. That's,
you know, I mean Rick's filled wisdom.

1170
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:15,990
Yeah. And it always comes out
so interesting. Um, but yeah,

1171
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,810
I get that. It's, you can't force it.

1172
01:13:19,230 --> 01:13:22,890
The threat I want to tease a little
bit is something you mentioned earlier,

1173
01:13:22,891 --> 01:13:27,891
which is a say the argument between the
strangers that in the diner that then

1174
01:13:28,321 --> 01:13:29,880
makes it into your movie.
Right.

1175
01:13:29,970 --> 01:13:34,530
Could you tell us or tell me since
I'm just sitting right here, uh,

1176
01:13:35,130 --> 01:13:38,430
your,
your history with the game of go,

1177
01:13:38,970 --> 01:13:40,890
I got into it a lot when I was doing pie,

1178
01:13:41,450 --> 01:13:45,640
I needed a game for the two guys to be
playing so that they had some reason that

1179
01:13:45,641 --> 01:13:49,450
they were meeting so that Max
and his mentor could meet.

1180
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:51,930
And I just thought playing chess was just,

1181
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:57,600
we've seen it so much and it's cliche
and mathematicians playing chess was just

1182
01:13:57,990 --> 01:13:59,250
not quite interesting enough.

1183
01:13:59,251 --> 01:14:03,870
And at that point 97 go was still very
much a fringe game, sort of is still.

1184
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:09,390
And um, but I think it was
much more fringe then and
we used to go a lot to the,

1185
01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:13,510
the New York go, um, meetings,

1186
01:14:13,540 --> 01:14:18,540
which were like 18 very intellectual
people and very book line departments at

1187
01:14:21,521 --> 01:14:25,930
different houses each week playing go.
So it was a great cast of characters,

1188
01:14:25,931 --> 01:14:27,010
just a fight. And they, you know,

1189
01:14:27,011 --> 01:14:31,150
the best thing about go
character go characters are
the ones that have said that

1190
01:14:31,270 --> 01:14:34,740
blow off chess as like a
full scale. You know, they,

1191
01:14:34,741 --> 01:14:38,710
they so looked down on chess and it's
just such a chip on their shoulder that

1192
01:14:38,711 --> 01:14:42,070
they've, they've graduated
to go. But that, you know,

1193
01:14:42,071 --> 01:14:44,470
and the thing that's fascinating that
I've been hearing a lot of people,

1194
01:14:44,471 --> 01:14:47,710
I think actually Rick was talking to me
about it. That's where I heard it was,

1195
01:14:48,010 --> 01:14:51,550
well he's the one I suggested I ask you.
Oh, there you go. But the documentary,

1196
01:14:51,551 --> 01:14:52,450
which I haven't seen yet,

1197
01:14:52,451 --> 01:14:55,540
he told me those are some
documentary about what it meant.

1198
01:14:56,110 --> 01:14:58,660
This computer finally
beating these go masters.

1199
01:14:58,661 --> 01:15:02,320
And he was telling them about a
scene where after the first move,

1200
01:15:02,380 --> 01:15:06,250
the go master gets up and
walks away because basically,

1201
01:15:07,030 --> 01:15:12,030
I guess the point was that it's such a
radical way to change of how the game is

1202
01:15:12,641 --> 01:15:14,770
played,
how this computer is playing it,

1203
01:15:15,490 --> 01:15:20,490
that it's actually affecting now how
humans play each other when that's,

1204
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:25,440
that's a line about AI that is
interesting where, you know,

1205
01:15:25,490 --> 01:15:30,100
it actually changes the way we act with
each other after thousands of years of

1206
01:15:30,101 --> 01:15:31,480
playing a game a certain way.

1207
01:15:31,660 --> 01:15:36,660
Suddenly this idea comes that is a moment
of genius that changes the way we look

1208
01:15:36,671 --> 01:15:40,380
at the board. That was interesting
idea. And the, is that from a dot?

1209
01:15:40,450 --> 01:15:42,440
That's from a document. I believe
so. But you have to ask Rick

1210
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:48,250
fascinate me and I was, I've been
thinking about it for 4 cents. See that?

1211
01:15:48,260 --> 01:15:51,260
And yeah, I don't want to take us
totally off the rails, but I play go.

1212
01:15:51,690 --> 01:15:56,100
I have a go board at my house.
I know. Not Good. Yeah. Uh,

1213
01:15:56,320 --> 01:16:01,320
I tend to play a hybrid version of
connect for fellow connect five.

1214
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:05,380
I doubled my brother and I love to play,

1215
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:08,380
we just call it connect five or something
like that where we use a goal board

1216
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:11,980
and it seems really childish.
But my brothers, I mean he's,

1217
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:16,000
he's a statistics phd, very
good chess player. Oh Wow.

1218
01:16:16,030 --> 01:16:18,670
And these games can actually
last a really, really low.

1219
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:21,580
It's just basically getting five in a
row and you could place him anywhere on

1220
01:16:21,581 --> 01:16:24,310
the board. It sounds great. It's
a great, and it can, it can take,

1221
01:16:24,311 --> 01:16:27,150
you don't flip on tiles or anything,
it's just about blocking jumps.

1222
01:16:27,190 --> 01:16:30,160
You leave them there so
you're not capturing, well,
you are capturing territory,

1223
01:16:30,161 --> 01:16:32,420
but the rules are completely
different from real go. Yeah. My,

1224
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:36,040
my son came home from math class with
fat on paper and we played it for a while

1225
01:16:36,041 --> 01:16:37,770
and I was like, wow, this
was complicated gang.

1226
01:16:37,790 --> 01:16:42,760
Super complicated and go is so
fascinating on many, many levels.

1227
01:16:42,790 --> 01:16:45,700
One of which is you can
feel like you're winning.

1228
01:16:45,850 --> 01:16:48,670
And then effectively if your,

1229
01:16:48,671 --> 01:16:53,050
if your pattern recognition is off in
a handful of moves, completely loose.

1230
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:56,800
I mean, it's, it, the tide
can turn a lot faster. Uh,

1231
01:16:56,870 --> 01:17:01,750
I shouldn't say this with any degree of
expert credibility because I know people

1232
01:17:01,751 --> 01:17:05,550
like Josh Waitzkin are actually good
at chess. I'm not, but, uh, uh, the,

1233
01:17:05,551 --> 01:17:08,310
the game I got really into, uh, in Japan.

1234
01:17:08,311 --> 01:17:10,740
So my first trip abroad

1235
01:17:10,770 --> 01:17:14,370
was a year in Japan as an exchange
student at a Japanese school,

1236
01:17:14,371 --> 01:17:15,510
lived with a Japanese family.

1237
01:17:15,930 --> 01:17:19,690
And I listened to the session
you did with the knife maker. Oh,

1238
01:17:19,691 --> 01:17:22,120
Spam Murray Carter Murray is amazing.

1239
01:17:22,121 --> 01:17:26,730
So I want to get something of his knives
are incredibly shit. There's so good. Uh,

1240
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:29,090
the Boutiquey line, oh,
his stuff is amazing.

1241
01:17:29,091 --> 01:17:33,520
It's the game I got
into was called a Shogi.

1242
01:17:33,521 --> 01:17:37,870
So shogi Japanese chess. Oh
Wow. And what makes shopping?

1243
01:17:37,890 --> 01:17:40,690
He's chest different and there are
ways you can play western chest this,

1244
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:41,530
this way,

1245
01:17:41,530 --> 01:17:46,530
but you're able to reuse the captured
pieces and just drop them on the board at

1246
01:17:47,591 --> 01:17:51,190
different places. And then also,
not only do ponds get promoted,

1247
01:17:51,550 --> 01:17:55,010
there are multiple pieces that turned
into completely different pieces. Sorry.

1248
01:17:55,020 --> 01:17:58,540
Cool. When they get supposed to
serve a lot of chess. Yeah. Yeah.

1249
01:17:58,541 --> 01:18:02,470
It's really a cool game. And so there's,
um, I used to buy these books in Japan,

1250
01:18:03,750 --> 01:18:05,360
so she'll get somebody Shogi is,
uh,

1251
01:18:06,070 --> 01:18:09,640
basically books that allow you
to think of a really slow APP.

1252
01:18:09,641 --> 01:18:10,810
It's a book where you,

1253
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:16,020
you try to figure out the three or four
moves in a given position necessary to

1254
01:18:16,391 --> 01:18:20,680
win the game. And then there's an answer
key. And so I would on the subway,

1255
01:18:20,740 --> 01:18:22,780
she had a lot of time on the
subway in Tokyo. At least I did.

1256
01:18:23,290 --> 01:18:26,890
I would either read comic books or I
would look at these some issue or I would

1257
01:18:26,891 --> 01:18:31,630
read judo textbooks. Um, but
I'm, I'm getting judo. Yeah.

1258
01:18:31,990 --> 01:18:33,780
Um, as an aside, yeah,

1259
01:18:33,810 --> 01:18:37,880
it's funny, the one eye, it was
very upsetting when they got, um,

1260
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:42,090
Wifi on the New York City subway
because now I have to work hard.

1261
01:18:42,420 --> 01:18:45,030
But like my rule is never
take out your phone.

1262
01:18:45,180 --> 01:18:47,580
Not because I'm worried about
getting stolen or anything,

1263
01:18:47,581 --> 01:18:52,020
but just because that's the chance
to watch people for me. And um,

1264
01:18:52,110 --> 01:18:55,710
so you don't want to get lost in your
device at that point. That's a great time.

1265
01:18:55,711 --> 01:18:57,330
And the, and the rule in
New York is great. You know,

1266
01:18:57,331 --> 01:19:01,290
basically you can stare at anyone you
want. If they make eye contact with you,

1267
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:02,910
you can never look at them again,

1268
01:19:03,420 --> 01:19:06,000
but you're allowed to look as long as
they don't look at you. And that's that.

1269
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:07,950
People come to New York. I
said, that's the real, you can,

1270
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:09,840
you can watch and check each other out.

1271
01:19:09,841 --> 01:19:13,720
But if they need realize you're
being checked out. Stop. So I,

1272
01:19:13,721 --> 01:19:16,410
I find it fascinating
and I imagine, uh, yeah,

1273
01:19:16,411 --> 01:19:20,790
the subways in Japan must be insane.
It's just, once again, you know,

1274
01:19:21,460 --> 01:19:22,870
which shocked me that,

1275
01:19:23,230 --> 01:19:26,950
I mean there's so many things that are
so alien about Japan for someone who

1276
01:19:26,951 --> 01:19:31,150
hasn't been exposed to Japan specifically,
even in East Asia.

1277
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:33,640
And I've spent time in China,
I've gone to school there,

1278
01:19:33,641 --> 01:19:37,330
I've spent time in Taiwan and spent
time in Japan, Japan, and within Japan.

1279
01:19:37,331 --> 01:19:42,300
Tokyo is just a particularly a
particular brand of weird. Yeah.

1280
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:46,240
And so you get on the subway
and I remember a couple
of things really striking

1281
01:19:46,241 --> 01:19:49,270
me. Some 15 everything's backwards, right?

1282
01:19:49,660 --> 01:19:51,820
We're driving on the
opposite side of the street,

1283
01:19:52,150 --> 01:19:54,640
like we have to take a shower
before we get into the bath.

1284
01:19:54,641 --> 01:19:58,300
I'm like all these rules that seem
very Alison wonderland, topsy turvy.

1285
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:02,560
And then I sit down on the
subway and you'll see, you know,

1286
01:20:02,561 --> 01:20:07,320
the salary men Saturday mom who are on
their way to work these worker bees and

1287
01:20:07,321 --> 01:20:11,940
their reading comic books with
the most explicit porn imaginable.

1288
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:16,110
And they're completely
nonchalant about it. Yeah, I
mean, Tentacle Porn, who knows?

1289
01:20:16,770 --> 01:20:21,420
And then the, uh, the other
hilarious phenomenon I bumped into,

1290
01:20:21,421 --> 01:20:24,120
which I'd really didn't expect.
So you hear about in Japan,

1291
01:20:24,121 --> 01:20:27,360
perverts on the subways and they're
definitely perverts on the subways and

1292
01:20:27,361 --> 01:20:29,450
they're called Chicago. So if
you're like, she can't, you got to,

1293
01:20:29,470 --> 01:20:31,080
that means a pervert per, per. Oh, really?

1294
01:20:31,110 --> 01:20:33,510
And so if like some guys trying
to fondle some girl's ass,

1295
01:20:33,511 --> 01:20:37,170
like you'll hit a key or Chicong and
then, you know, there's big kerfuffle.

1296
01:20:37,740 --> 01:20:41,530
What they don't tell you is that, uh,
I remember one day I was in my street

1297
01:20:41,700 --> 01:20:44,430
Conan kerfuffle in one sentence,
just so you know,

1298
01:20:44,510 --> 01:20:49,240
might be the first time, uh, the
singularity is near. And, uh,

1299
01:20:49,340 --> 01:20:52,840
I was in my school uniform 15
clearly a high school student, right.

1300
01:20:53,090 --> 01:20:54,890
Have my Judy uniform over my shoulder.

1301
01:20:54,891 --> 01:20:59,330
It's wrapped up and I'm standing
up as packed subway and I fear,

1302
01:20:59,390 --> 01:21:04,280
I feel someone groping my ass. Oh Wow.
And I'm like, what is going on here?

1303
01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:09,610
I can't turn around because it's so
crowded and eventually I'm able to turn

1304
01:21:09,711 --> 01:21:12,320
around and what do I see?
Not what I expect.

1305
01:21:12,350 --> 01:21:17,090
I see two really old women
with like half of their teeth,

1306
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:22,500
w captain gold chuckling to themselves
because they'd been grabbing my ass.

1307
01:21:23,570 --> 01:21:28,400
And these women are called [inaudible]
young [inaudible] young is from old

1308
01:21:28,401 --> 01:21:31,130
battalion,
which it's a long story,

1309
01:21:31,131 --> 01:21:34,940
but it refers to like older Japanese
women who just don't give a fuck anymore.

1310
01:21:36,290 --> 01:21:39,630
And so, yeah, it was a real
cold night. My favorite,

1311
01:21:40,110 --> 01:21:44,630
you know, when I went to Japan for the
first time, which was with pie, you know,

1312
01:21:44,631 --> 01:21:49,040
I was, I was a big, huge
fan of, um, I had all,

1313
01:21:49,041 --> 01:21:53,860
I dreamt for so long and I go to Tokyo.
Um, and I was like, you know, I Kinda,

1314
01:21:53,950 --> 01:21:56,440
I want kind of want to make a
statement here. I kinda, you know,

1315
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:58,490
I want to be remembered, you know,
I'm coming with this a little film,

1316
01:21:58,491 --> 01:21:59,324
what can I do?

1317
01:21:59,390 --> 01:22:04,070
So I had dyed my hair purple and I came
and I do an interview is the whole time

1318
01:22:04,071 --> 01:22:07,340
with big bright purple hair
and no one mentions it.

1319
01:22:08,180 --> 01:22:11,780
And I get to my last interview and it's
kind of a young hip guy who's like a pop

1320
01:22:11,781 --> 01:22:15,560
star in Japan and we become buddies
and I'm like, man, you know,

1321
01:22:15,590 --> 01:22:20,350
like I've made my head purple, but no
one's commented on it. And he goes, yeah,

1322
01:22:20,360 --> 01:22:23,570
come to the window. And we look outside
and it's a major intersection. Says,

1323
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:26,600
who has purple hair out there?
All the old ladies,

1324
01:22:26,990 --> 01:22:30,770
hi, they are here. And I'm like, oh,

1325
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:37,520
that's totally true. Hundred
percent accurate. Oh my God,

1326
01:22:37,521 --> 01:22:39,980
I don't even pieces together.
That's true. I'm having flashbacks.

1327
01:22:39,990 --> 01:22:42,110
I think the old ladies are grabbing
that and it's like, you know,

1328
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:46,190
in requiem for a dream, they dyed
their hair red and then it's purple.

1329
01:22:46,240 --> 01:22:50,720
So probably funny.
So speaking of Tentacle Porn,

1330
01:22:51,160 --> 01:22:54,110
uh, this is, that's about as
graceful segway as that can make,

1331
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:57,140
and we don't have to talk about
this if you don't want to,

1332
01:22:57,141 --> 01:23:00,590
but this is one of the bullets that was
recommended for me to talk to you about.

1333
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:04,850
And I should preface this by saying,
in my second book for our body,

1334
01:23:04,851 --> 01:23:07,270
there are two chapters on female orgasm,

1335
01:23:07,510 --> 01:23:10,480
two on various aspects of male sexuality.

1336
01:23:10,481 --> 01:23:13,600
So I'm not shy about talking about this,

1337
01:23:13,601 --> 01:23:15,510
but recently I'm on the Howard stern show,

1338
01:23:15,530 --> 01:23:19,150
suddenly are in the Howard stern
show restricting ejaculation.

1339
01:23:19,330 --> 01:23:21,610
I don't have any context for this,

1340
01:23:22,210 --> 01:23:25,090
but I was told to ask you about
restricting ejaculation. Wow.

1341
01:23:25,091 --> 01:23:28,580
Where'd you get that from?
My sources cannot be made.

1342
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:33,190
Uh, but is that something
that you can tell us about?

1343
01:23:33,390 --> 01:23:38,010
Um, I'm not sure what you're
referencing. Oh, I think, oh,

1344
01:23:38,011 --> 01:23:42,480
there we go. It's coming back to
me. Oh, W it was funny. I had,

1345
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:44,310
I had a, um, well there's in,

1346
01:23:44,311 --> 01:23:47,490
in a requiem for a dream that is something
in the background called month of

1347
01:23:47,491 --> 01:23:52,110
fury. Um, which was, I guess
it was early self-help. Um,

1348
01:23:52,590 --> 01:23:55,710
I had, uh, when I, wow,

1349
01:23:55,711 --> 01:23:59,640
this is going way back and actually kind
of flows a little bit into probably why,

1350
01:24:00,090 --> 01:24:02,130
um,
we're,

1351
01:24:02,190 --> 01:24:05,790
we're a growing friendship has
happening here because, uh,

1352
01:24:05,940 --> 01:24:10,200
similar roots in a certain way. But when
I, my first, when I was in film school,

1353
01:24:10,740 --> 01:24:14,760
and then there's another great thing
for young film students to know is like,

1354
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:17,400
there's usually the first screenplay
you write that we'll never get made.

1355
01:24:17,700 --> 01:24:21,330
And believe me, that happens. And
at a certain point you have to be,

1356
01:24:21,630 --> 01:24:24,780
you take the bold step to abandon it,
you know,

1357
01:24:24,900 --> 01:24:28,200
because there's a learning process.
And that first script,

1358
01:24:28,620 --> 01:24:32,070
and I worked on a script that was
set in Coney island and I had a guy,

1359
01:24:32,770 --> 01:24:36,660
really talented kid I grew up with who
probably if you went to Wall Street would

1360
01:24:36,661 --> 01:24:39,480
be a, you know, a hundred
millionaire type of guy.

1361
01:24:39,810 --> 01:24:44,810
But he ended up getting involved in
this kind of culty organization that are

1362
01:24:45,001 --> 01:24:48,450
those guys who go around and sell roses
and little toys around the streets

1363
01:24:48,451 --> 01:24:50,130
wearing ties.
I don't know if you ever see them.

1364
01:24:50,131 --> 01:24:51,930
There are a lot on the
west coast and they,

1365
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:56,550
they're basically kind of pyramid schemes
where you basically open up an office

1366
01:24:56,551 --> 01:25:00,630
and you hire like 10 20 year old kids
and they go and they hustle for you and

1367
01:25:00,631 --> 01:25:03,330
then you buy it from a guy above you.
And then if you get a few,

1368
01:25:03,331 --> 01:25:05,640
you slowly move up this type of thing.

1369
01:25:05,850 --> 01:25:09,270
And they have these huge conventions in
Vegas with where they all come together

1370
01:25:09,271 --> 01:25:12,720
and they have all these chants where
they choose each other up and get all

1371
01:25:12,721 --> 01:25:17,700
excited. And I, I, when I
was in film school, he was
in the, uh, west coast area.

1372
01:25:17,701 --> 01:25:21,030
And so I just sort of studied it
and hung out with them. Once again,

1373
01:25:21,031 --> 01:25:24,960
here's another play, hang out with a
friend but also kind of get stories.

1374
01:25:25,740 --> 01:25:30,570
So I developed this whole
kind of characters and world
for this movie about this.

1375
01:25:30,571 --> 01:25:32,160
And eventually I didn't make that film,

1376
01:25:32,161 --> 01:25:33,910
but I was able to take that character and,

1377
01:25:34,230 --> 01:25:38,490
and when I had to bring a Hubert
Selby Jr is requiem for a dream alive,

1378
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:41,580
Sour Goldfarb.
The old lady watched a lot of TV,

1379
01:25:41,581 --> 01:25:44,730
but we couldn't afford the
TV to put TV on the channel.

1380
01:25:44,731 --> 01:25:49,731
So I decided to make my own TV show and
create and create kind of a Tony Robbins

1381
01:25:49,951 --> 01:25:53,370
ask because Tony was just
starting and it was, he,

1382
01:25:53,550 --> 01:25:56,820
he didn't sort of evolve into
the kind of figure he is now.

1383
01:25:56,820 --> 01:26:00,480
At the time he was sort of a tele van. No
one really knew what it was. And it was,

1384
01:26:00,540 --> 01:26:01,373
it was odd.

1385
01:26:01,650 --> 01:26:05,360
So I kind of create my own sort of of
that and had this guy on TV and I had to

1386
01:26:05,361 --> 01:26:08,750
give him a philosophy.
So I had an act,

1387
01:26:08,751 --> 01:26:13,040
a friend who was also a boxer and he
had this thing called Mama Fury Eddie.

1388
01:26:13,041 --> 01:26:15,710
The harp is his name.
And it was three rules,

1389
01:26:15,770 --> 01:26:19,600
which are actually three great
rules. It was 30 days. Uh,

1390
01:26:19,670 --> 01:26:23,450
no refined sugar,
30 days,

1391
01:26:23,451 --> 01:26:26,690
no red meat and 30 days, no. Our, yes,

1392
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:32,180
now those all together. Yeah. You do
all three, four a month for 30 days.

1393
01:26:32,450 --> 01:26:34,840
And it was actually a very
interesting, you know, so,

1394
01:26:34,950 --> 01:26:38,370
so he preached it to me cause he would
do it before he would box or one more.

1395
01:26:38,380 --> 01:26:40,970
You died? No refined sugar, no
refined sugar. So that's everything.

1396
01:26:40,971 --> 01:26:43,670
Like toothpaste anywhere where
there could be sugar, you know,

1397
01:26:43,790 --> 01:26:46,040
no red meat and then no orgasm.

1398
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:49,130
So in the movie requiem for a dream,

1399
01:26:49,170 --> 01:26:54,140
the third one is not actually pitched it
because I just thought it would be good

1400
01:26:54,141 --> 01:26:57,590
as a little secret. Now I'm sort of giving
it away, although it's come out of it.

1401
01:26:57,610 --> 01:27:00,140
Uh, it's, it's actually in there.
It's actually in their bit.

1402
01:27:00,710 --> 01:27:02,960
It's an Easter egg that's
hidden in the film somewhere.

1403
01:27:03,410 --> 01:27:08,190
It was funny because when I'm, you
know, when we started working on it,

1404
01:27:08,310 --> 01:27:13,310
I suggested it to the actors that they
should go on a month of fury before we

1405
01:27:13,501 --> 01:27:17,130
make the movie.
Just to understand what it is to withdraw,

1406
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,380
which is a big part of the movie creek.

1407
01:27:20,390 --> 01:27:23,850
Cause it's hard if you're not a
drug addict or a smoker, you know,

1408
01:27:23,851 --> 01:27:28,780
to actually stop to something for 30 days
to fast as you talked about too. It's,

1409
01:27:28,781 --> 01:27:29,581
it's really tricky.

1410
01:27:29,581 --> 01:27:32,670
And here with three things that
were seemingly not hard to do.

1411
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:34,740
And it was funny to, you know, run,

1412
01:27:35,160 --> 01:27:40,130
see my actors that they 24 and
25 wind to kill me, I don't know.

1413
01:27:40,250 --> 01:27:42,630
And it's the month I have
another friend of mine,

1414
01:27:42,660 --> 01:27:47,280
well my best buddy who actually on
day 29 ended up proposing to a woman,

1415
01:27:47,281 --> 01:27:50,360
which I was like,
you never propose on day 29,

1416
01:27:50,361 --> 01:27:55,200
what are you out of your freaking mind,
the month of fury,

1417
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:59,450
fury. So if I ever did a self
help, that would be, you know, hey,

1418
01:27:59,451 --> 01:28:03,380
if you want to cowrite and
start a movement, I know
you, I know you've got down,

1419
01:28:04,220 --> 01:28:07,490
you heard here first folks,
I could, I could get,

1420
01:28:07,730 --> 01:28:10,050
I think quite a few people to
participate in the muck theory,

1421
01:28:10,110 --> 01:28:11,360
actually very effective.

1422
01:28:11,660 --> 01:28:15,230
I'd love to ask quite a few
questions about the new film. Uh,

1423
01:28:15,290 --> 01:28:19,670
but the first is related
to the writing of the film.

1424
01:28:20,150 --> 01:28:25,150
So when you are writing a film
like mother and there are many,

1425
01:28:25,371 --> 01:28:29,390
and I don't want to give anything away,
but many visual components,

1426
01:28:29,930 --> 01:28:33,560
how do you write that type of material?

1427
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:38,420
Being the writer and then the director.
I can sort of,

1428
01:28:38,450 --> 01:28:43,250
um, not worry about that that much, but
there are two different steps. I think.

1429
01:28:43,251 --> 01:28:48,251
First you're writing and you're following
along the emotional truth of the

1430
01:28:48,351 --> 01:28:50,600
characters and following scene by scene,

1431
01:28:50,601 --> 01:28:53,210
what's going on and
watching the story unfold.

1432
01:28:53,870 --> 01:28:56,090
And then there's the next stage.

1433
01:28:56,091 --> 01:28:59,270
At a certain point you kind of hang up
most of your writing cap because you can

1434
01:28:59,271 --> 01:29:00,710
always rewrite if you're the writer,

1435
01:29:00,711 --> 01:29:05,130
but then you start to become the director
and start to think about blocking and

1436
01:29:05,131 --> 01:29:08,280
movement. And that was very,
very big deal in this film.

1437
01:29:08,310 --> 01:29:10,930
Can you define blocking just for
people who don't know? Yeah, sure.

1438
01:29:10,950 --> 01:29:14,280
Blocking is basically just how actors
move in a scene. It's all it is,

1439
01:29:14,281 --> 01:29:16,750
but it's really truly,
um,

1440
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:20,920
a big part of the work because
for a lot of reasons. Um,

1441
01:29:21,030 --> 01:29:26,030
first you want to create blocking that's
organic and natural to what the actors

1442
01:29:26,850 --> 01:29:27,960
are doing in the scene.

1443
01:29:27,961 --> 01:29:32,280
So you want to make sure whatever the
actors doing makes sense with what their

1444
01:29:32,281 --> 01:29:35,700
objective is in the scene or what they're
doing in the scene or what they're not

1445
01:29:35,701 --> 01:29:37,830
doing in the scene or what
they're hiding in the scene.

1446
01:29:38,130 --> 01:29:41,490
So you kind of want to think about
what that, what that is all about.

1447
01:29:42,540 --> 01:29:46,110
Then there's a second tier,
which is as the filmmaker,

1448
01:29:46,111 --> 01:29:49,080
you're trying to make it
as economical as possible,

1449
01:29:49,081 --> 01:29:53,550
meaning as few setups as few times
to move the camera as possible.

1450
01:29:53,550 --> 01:29:56,640
Because every time you have to
sort of change where the camera is,

1451
01:29:56,641 --> 01:30:01,110
you have to change the lighting and that
just takes time and you want to get as

1452
01:30:01,111 --> 01:30:03,540
much time being shooting as possible.

1453
01:30:03,541 --> 01:30:08,070
So you're trying to figure out blocking
that works best for the simplest amount

1454
01:30:08,071 --> 01:30:12,090
of technical problems unless you're
really trying to do something technically

1455
01:30:12,091 --> 01:30:13,500
super challenging stuff.

1456
01:30:14,250 --> 01:30:17,110
So you try to balance those and you know,

1457
01:30:17,250 --> 01:30:20,160
and it's kind of a balance
because sometimes you will,
you'll tell the actor, oh,

1458
01:30:20,161 --> 01:30:23,370
can you help me out here with blocking?
Cause it means we have to do less,

1459
01:30:23,640 --> 01:30:26,340
but sometimes you don't want to get
in their way and you want them to be

1460
01:30:26,341 --> 01:30:27,330
creatively free.

1461
01:30:27,331 --> 01:30:32,220
So you want to give them
an open playground to play
around then where they can

1462
01:30:32,221 --> 01:30:36,390
do and move. So it's all, it's, it's,
it's a balancing act, um, but it,

1463
01:30:36,420 --> 01:30:39,690
but it's a big part of it. So
at a certain point, you know,

1464
01:30:39,691 --> 01:30:43,020
when the script is done,
and in the case of mother,

1465
01:30:43,590 --> 01:30:47,370
I was actually lucky enough to have a
three and a half month rehearsal period

1466
01:30:47,371 --> 01:30:48,860
where basically,
um,

1467
01:30:49,380 --> 01:30:52,380
I convinced Jennifer Lawrence and Javier
Bardem and Michelle Pfeiffer and then

1468
01:30:52,381 --> 01:30:57,381
Harris to join me in a warehouse out in
East Brooklyn where we basically taped

1469
01:30:57,571 --> 01:30:59,130
out the set and got,

1470
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:02,250
we would work on the scenes and then
we'd get up on our feet and we would just

1471
01:31:02,251 --> 01:31:03,270
start the block then.

1472
01:31:03,690 --> 01:31:07,740
And then in the last two weeks of that
three and a half month long process,

1473
01:31:07,741 --> 01:31:11,970
I actually brought in my camera man
and we shot the entire movie moving the

1474
01:31:11,971 --> 01:31:15,420
camera around on video as
kind of homework and then,

1475
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:18,960
which was really fascinating because
you figure out all different types of

1476
01:31:18,961 --> 01:31:22,380
problems like oh,
how's the camera going to get from it's,

1477
01:31:22,410 --> 01:31:24,720
it's a constant moving handheld camera.

1478
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:28,710
So how am I going to get the camera from
here to there because there's a wall

1479
01:31:28,711 --> 01:31:32,280
there. Um, and, and that's,

1480
01:31:32,340 --> 01:31:36,990
that's suddenly started to play into
action. And for this film it was a very,

1481
01:31:36,991 --> 01:31:40,740
very restricted visual language.
I was part of the,

1482
01:31:40,830 --> 01:31:42,780
one of the challenges I
put in front of myself.

1483
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:47,610
Normally you'll have a wide shot in a
movie and nice thing about a wide shot is

1484
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:53,130
if an actor is somehow does something
that's not, that's like dramatically new,

1485
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:58,160
emotionally new or if they decide to
comb their hair a different way in each.

1486
01:31:59,620 --> 01:32:00,940
If you go out to a wide shot,

1487
01:32:01,270 --> 01:32:06,270
the basically the illusion is broken for
a moment because the viewer's eyes have

1488
01:32:06,881 --> 01:32:10,230
to take in more or different part of a
scene or there's other things to look at

1489
01:32:10,231 --> 01:32:15,231
so that when you pop back into a closeup
you can get away cheap almost what's

1490
01:32:15,431 --> 01:32:19,630
happening and no one would ever notice.
In the case of my film,

1491
01:32:20,230 --> 01:32:24,220
since there was no wide shots,
it was extremely challenging.

1492
01:32:24,221 --> 01:32:26,990
I mean the only shots in the film
are you the over Jennifer Lawrence,

1493
01:32:26,991 --> 01:32:30,160
his shoulder on Jennifer Lawrence,
his face or her point of view,

1494
01:32:30,161 --> 01:32:33,220
which means what she's looking at. That's
the only coverage in the entire film,

1495
01:32:33,610 --> 01:32:35,850
so that's why this edit has been,
you know,

1496
01:32:35,890 --> 01:32:40,890
almost a year long cut because I had
such a limited amount of language to work

1497
01:32:41,111 --> 01:32:46,111
with and I had to make every moment by
moment by moment work even though that's

1498
01:32:47,230 --> 01:32:49,000
not really happening in real time.

1499
01:32:49,170 --> 01:32:54,090
Why did you choose to use that constraint?
I find,

1500
01:32:54,930 --> 01:32:58,290
I feel like I could talk to you about
constraints and rules for a really long

1501
01:32:58,291 --> 01:33:02,010
time because you mentioned, yeah, exactly.

1502
01:33:02,250 --> 01:33:03,810
Just get progressively more belligerent.

1503
01:33:04,140 --> 01:33:08,850
And you talked about say having lunch
scheduled for after the difficult meeting

1504
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:10,590
and then you have say,

1505
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:15,660
shooting over Max's shoulder
and different ways of,

1506
01:33:15,960 --> 01:33:19,740
as you put it, sort of limiting your
visual palate. Why, why do that?

1507
01:33:19,940 --> 01:33:21,590
Well, I think, I think it coming out,

1508
01:33:21,740 --> 01:33:26,330
starting as an independent filmmaker
with very limited resources, uh,

1509
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:31,250
makes you be very, very, you
know, try your, you strategically,

1510
01:33:31,251 --> 01:33:36,251
you have to figure out economical means
to basically take advantage of all the

1511
01:33:37,641 --> 01:33:39,230
limited resources you have.

1512
01:33:39,680 --> 01:33:44,680
So I ended up actually stylistically
creating techniques that actually turn

1513
01:33:46,190 --> 01:33:50,210
those limited economics
and to a stylistic choice.

1514
01:33:50,240 --> 01:33:55,190
So I've always been preaching that
boundaries are the most important thing in

1515
01:33:55,191 --> 01:33:58,430
any form of an art. You know,
I mean, when you're a painter,

1516
01:33:58,431 --> 01:34:01,860
you have the boundaries of a canvas
and the limitation of your, of the,

1517
01:34:01,870 --> 01:34:03,680
your colors.
Um,

1518
01:34:03,710 --> 01:34:08,630
and I think it's extremely important to
do the same in filmmaking, uh, and, and,

1519
01:34:08,631 --> 01:34:12,170
and to make real choices about
how you want to do those limits.

1520
01:34:12,650 --> 01:34:16,310
Sometimes they're self imposed.
I have less of the economic issues,

1521
01:34:16,311 --> 01:34:20,660
although always you, you have to be
very economically responsible for it,

1522
01:34:21,020 --> 01:34:24,620
for what you're doing. But I went really
extreme on this film, which was like,

1523
01:34:24,710 --> 01:34:28,430
I basically said,
there's three shots for every scene,

1524
01:34:28,760 --> 01:34:33,720
which is an incredibly low amount of
shots, but I would normally do, um,

1525
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:38,750
in a movie. And it just became an
interesting exercise and experiment and,

1526
01:34:38,751 --> 01:34:42,050
you know, and there were times when
Maddie, my DP was like, don't you want to,

1527
01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:42,291
you know,

1528
01:34:42,291 --> 01:34:47,291
like never does a character come
between Jennifer and the camera.

1529
01:34:47,830 --> 01:34:50,870
Yeah. No one never crosses
the line. I noticed that,

1530
01:34:51,380 --> 01:34:56,090
which is crazy because when we're
doing crowd scenes with lots of people,

1531
01:34:56,150 --> 01:34:56,720
you know,

1532
01:34:56,720 --> 01:35:01,070
it would a lot easier to tell the story
by having Jen get lost in the crowd and

1533
01:35:01,071 --> 01:35:05,150
crowd come through. But no,
I was like, and my DP mad, he
was like, why? Why don't we,

1534
01:35:05,151 --> 01:35:08,690
it could be. And we talked about it for
a while and, and, uh, and I was like, no,

1535
01:35:08,691 --> 01:35:13,520
I think let's just remain Orthodox here.
Let's remain truthful to the intent.

1536
01:35:13,550 --> 01:35:15,740
And the one thing I was worried about,

1537
01:35:15,741 --> 01:35:20,270
people would feel claustrophobic
or you know, bored by the style.

1538
01:35:20,271 --> 01:35:24,380
And that doesn't seem to be the response
people are in seeing those limitations.

1539
01:35:24,381 --> 01:35:27,680
And I think that's because we just turned
it into a language and into a style

1540
01:35:27,681 --> 01:35:28,820
that people can understand.

1541
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:34,000
Is there something you hope audiences
will respond with our walkout with?

1542
01:35:34,430 --> 01:35:37,580
Did you have an objective,

1543
01:35:37,790 --> 01:35:41,690
and this ties into I suppose the,
the genesis of the film as well.

1544
01:35:41,691 --> 01:35:43,490
I don't actually know the origin story.

1545
01:35:43,580 --> 01:35:45,620
Well the origin story is
hard cause it's murky.

1546
01:35:45,890 --> 01:35:48,530
I think it came out of
these endless headlines,

1547
01:35:48,590 --> 01:35:52,250
the endless stream of
notifications on your telephone.

1548
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:57,880
The ability to scratch right beneath the
surface of our kind of civilization and

1549
01:35:58,971 --> 01:36:03,971
realize how many desperate and awful
things are happening around the planet.

1550
01:36:04,141 --> 01:36:06,620
It's still in this,
you know,

1551
01:36:06,710 --> 01:36:11,710
pretty enlightened time and there's a
lot of rage and a lot of helplessness

1552
01:36:12,771 --> 01:36:16,940
because like what can I do? How
can I stop this? And you know,

1553
01:36:17,570 --> 01:36:21,560
being an environmentalist when
we're completely under assault,

1554
01:36:22,040 --> 01:36:26,210
when you know what science
is telling us is going on.

1555
01:36:26,810 --> 01:36:30,680
And the same people that use their smart
phone every second and every minute of

1556
01:36:30,681 --> 01:36:34,760
the day of the people who say, well,
science isn't always right yet. This,

1557
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:39,500
the product of science is in their pocket,
you know,

1558
01:36:39,650 --> 01:36:43,970
dominating their lives yet
refusing to see what's going on.

1559
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:48,770
Like how could you not say, wow, there
might be some connection going on.

1560
01:36:49,340 --> 01:36:52,180
And I don't know. I come from a
science background and I, I, I, I,

1561
01:36:52,181 --> 01:36:54,200
I witnessed how little tiny,

1562
01:36:54,201 --> 01:36:59,201
small changes by men can deeply have
huge effects very quickly that are out of

1563
01:36:59,811 --> 01:37:03,920
control, you know, and then this
new idea of these feedback loops,

1564
01:37:03,921 --> 01:37:05,000
which isn't that new anymore,

1565
01:37:05,001 --> 01:37:08,090
but these ideas that are becoming more
idea that there's these tipping points

1566
01:37:08,091 --> 01:37:12,260
where things are just going to start to
accelerate. You know? And as a parent,

1567
01:37:12,290 --> 01:37:15,050
I just sit there and I
go, oh my gosh, you know,

1568
01:37:15,051 --> 01:37:20,051
I look at the beauty of my child and
want them forget about having a job,

1569
01:37:21,290 --> 01:37:25,280
having a freaking atmosphere and
having the ability to, I mean,

1570
01:37:25,281 --> 01:37:28,890
it's just crazy to ever think that, you
know, he'll see, uh, uh, really, uh,

1571
01:37:28,910 --> 01:37:33,860
an elephant in the wild and in any
type of wilderness way. I mean, I,

1572
01:37:33,870 --> 01:37:34,760
I, for the, for I guess,

1573
01:37:34,761 --> 01:37:38,870
I guess Prince William Sound was very
much wilderness when I was a kid and

1574
01:37:38,900 --> 01:37:42,360
something happened to me
when I was in Prince William
Sound. That was, I had a, um,

1575
01:37:42,590 --> 01:37:44,390
we were kayaking, as I said, for weeks,

1576
01:37:44,391 --> 01:37:48,650
and I was eating a granola bar and
the wrap or fell into the water,

1577
01:37:48,680 --> 01:37:52,830
it was like a foil wrapper. And I
freaked out. I like stopped. I tried to,

1578
01:37:52,831 --> 01:37:56,580
it just went right on there. And
because of the guilt of that, I still,

1579
01:37:56,581 --> 01:38:01,540
when I see trash on a beach, I pick it up
for that foil. You know, it's like that,

1580
01:38:01,541 --> 01:38:04,100
that guilt has carried me and I,

1581
01:38:04,230 --> 01:38:07,470
because at that time it
very much felt untouched.

1582
01:38:08,070 --> 01:38:11,130
Like I was the f one of the first
humans to ever experience it.

1583
01:38:11,700 --> 01:38:15,540
There isn't a place on the planet anymore,
not because of pollution only,

1584
01:38:15,870 --> 01:38:18,930
but because of climate change
that isn't effected by humans.

1585
01:38:18,931 --> 01:38:23,931
There is nowhere on the planet that is
true wilderness as it was 60 years ago.

1586
01:38:25,020 --> 01:38:29,220
You know, when I was, I was writing
a western and I realized, you know,

1587
01:38:29,340 --> 01:38:34,080
it was set in 1883 I think if every
single person on the planet disappear,

1588
01:38:34,081 --> 01:38:37,590
drop dead was abducted or
whatever at that point in time,

1589
01:38:37,890 --> 01:38:42,570
besides some forge metals, belt
buckles, horseshoes, bullets, guns,

1590
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:48,480
everything, every remnant of humanity
would be gone in a century, you know,

1591
01:38:48,810 --> 01:38:50,300
completely gone because it was,

1592
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:55,400
everything was built out
of earth materials and then
you suddenly have all these

1593
01:38:55,471 --> 01:39:00,471
freakish new materials where every single
bag of Lay's potato chip you have is

1594
01:39:00,751 --> 01:39:02,910
something that's around for 10,000 years,

1595
01:39:03,450 --> 01:39:08,100
longer particles that are part
of us and you can't escape it.

1596
01:39:08,100 --> 01:39:12,750
And so quickly from my childhood where
there still was places on the planet that

1597
01:39:12,780 --> 01:39:16,650
weren't really feeling any
impact to now where the,

1598
01:39:16,860 --> 01:39:18,980
it's all changed.
It's,

1599
01:39:18,990 --> 01:39:23,520
it's scary that people are just completely
denying it and turning their backs on

1600
01:39:23,521 --> 01:39:28,140
it. And out of that just, you know, I
just want to how it's like, you know,

1601
01:39:28,141 --> 01:39:33,141
I felt the Ginsberg howl and I just
wanted to Hal and I guess it's my how,

1602
01:39:33,990 --> 01:39:38,730
what is the Ginsburg Hell,
Alan Ginsburg, uh, the poem.
How got it. All right. Sorry,

1603
01:39:38,731 --> 01:39:40,730
I'm, they never read the
trading, my lack of it, you know,

1604
01:39:40,750 --> 01:39:43,080
show that way you should read. Oh, that
one's great. All right. Yeah, I mean,

1605
01:39:43,081 --> 01:39:46,290
but it's basically, you know, it
was a cry from the 60s you know,

1606
01:39:46,291 --> 01:39:49,020
of like what for his generation or
at least that's the way I took it.

1607
01:39:49,110 --> 01:39:54,110
How would you like people to go into the
movie and who should go see them now?

1608
01:39:54,540 --> 01:39:59,400
The obvious commercial answer might be
after everyone. Yeah. Well, I think,

1609
01:39:59,401 --> 01:39:59,641
look,

1610
01:39:59,641 --> 01:40:03,570
I think you got to know you're going
into a roller coaster ride and it's like,

1611
01:40:03,571 --> 01:40:04,404
you know,

1612
01:40:04,530 --> 01:40:07,710
when you get to the amusement park and
you see that loop de loop and you're like,

1613
01:40:07,711 --> 01:40:12,570
no freaking way, you should, you
should be ready for it. I mean,

1614
01:40:12,710 --> 01:40:17,640
yeah. And no matter how much I prep you
and Tim can tell you, it goes there, so,

1615
01:40:18,030 --> 01:40:20,610
right. I mean it's, it's intense and it's,

1616
01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:26,070
so if you want an intense different
ride, if you're, you know,

1617
01:40:26,890 --> 01:40:29,670
you want to see something different
at the, at the cinema, you know,

1618
01:40:29,671 --> 01:40:34,020
please come on down. Um, I, I
think, I think it's, uh, you know,

1619
01:40:34,021 --> 01:40:37,260
that's what we tried to do was make,
make a very unique rollercoaster. Except,

1620
01:40:37,261 --> 01:40:41,340
you know, it may go off the
tracks and into the concrete wall,

1621
01:40:41,370 --> 01:40:45,030
but I can't really be,
I don't want to be responsible for that,

1622
01:40:45,031 --> 01:40:48,620
but that's what happens.
But I mean, I just want,

1623
01:40:49,170 --> 01:40:51,030
I think it works on a lot of levels.
Um,

1624
01:40:51,900 --> 01:40:55,450
I was always like thinking was
going to be really scary and,

1625
01:40:56,800 --> 01:41:00,370
and you know, tilting into the
horror genre. You know, Jen Lawrence,

1626
01:41:00,371 --> 01:41:03,910
when she saw it actually thought it
was incredibly beautiful and moving,

1627
01:41:04,210 --> 01:41:06,750
that there was a beauty
to it. And, and then I,

1628
01:41:06,751 --> 01:41:11,680
and I've heard that reflected in a lot
of ways and so it's definitely not your

1629
01:41:11,681 --> 01:41:16,600
normal night at the movie. It's, but it's
the type of movie that you go see and,

1630
01:41:16,690 --> 01:41:20,500
and everyone will have something
to say about it, I think. Um,

1631
01:41:21,220 --> 01:41:25,870
and hopefully they're not too many
profane words directed in my direction.

1632
01:41:27,010 --> 01:41:31,090
Well, it could be profaned, but modifying
something good also. Yeah, there's that.

1633
01:41:31,120 --> 01:41:35,600
Yeah.
I'd like to ask about the sound.

1634
01:41:35,900 --> 01:41:40,640
Yeah.
So I have read that,

1635
01:41:40,820 --> 01:41:43,310
well,
a few things that a,

1636
01:41:43,311 --> 01:41:47,330
a lot of independent films or films in
general fail from poor audio quality.

1637
01:41:47,350 --> 01:41:50,680
That was a big thing I realized
very young in my career was like,

1638
01:41:51,160 --> 01:41:54,550
this is a pretty good movie, but
something's off. And it was always a sound

1639
01:41:54,760 --> 01:41:57,950
and the sound in this movie and in a,
and I mean in,

1640
01:41:57,951 --> 01:42:02,951
in more than one of your
films certainly is a very,

1641
01:42:03,641 --> 01:42:07,780
I'm searching for the right words,
but very visceral, very pronounced.

1642
01:42:08,860 --> 01:42:10,240
And uh,

1643
01:42:10,270 --> 01:42:15,040
I only read this other expression
after the fact after I saw the movie,

1644
01:42:15,041 --> 01:42:20,041
but that I think thinking
of music or the sound as a,

1645
01:42:20,620 --> 01:42:25,300
as an additional character. Yeah. Could
you elaborate on that? Because I've, I've,

1646
01:42:25,360 --> 01:42:28,450
I've never paid so much
attention to sound in a film.

1647
01:42:28,820 --> 01:42:32,480
I think it's a, well, you, you saw
a slightly unfinished, the only,

1648
01:42:32,481 --> 01:42:36,290
the first half of the film was
kind of Po really dialed in,

1649
01:42:36,410 --> 01:42:37,730
so it's going to get better.

1650
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:40,790
I hope that's what we're supposed
to be doing as we speak. You know,

1651
01:42:40,791 --> 01:42:41,511
sound designed.

1652
01:42:41,511 --> 01:42:44,720
It for me is a huge tool and I got
totally turned on when I was a, uh,

1653
01:42:44,770 --> 01:42:46,040
a young kid.

1654
01:42:46,041 --> 01:42:50,240
I saw a documentary on the guys who did
the sound design for star wars and they

1655
01:42:50,241 --> 01:42:53,930
were out in the desert banging on wires,
making light saber sounds and it,

1656
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,990
it blew my mind. I was
like, Oh wow, you know,

1657
01:42:57,020 --> 01:43:01,400
that's such a cool idea that you can
use any sound to do this and matching up

1658
01:43:01,401 --> 01:43:03,080
sound and image you
can really mess around.

1659
01:43:03,081 --> 01:43:07,080
So I've always been fascinated by
that. Um, but you know, since I move,

1660
01:43:07,100 --> 01:43:10,460
make these films where I really am trying
to make the audience have a visceral

1661
01:43:10,461 --> 01:43:14,420
experience with the character. In this
case Jennifer Lawrence's character,

1662
01:43:14,960 --> 01:43:19,960
I try to draw the audience into her
subjective point of view by you know,

1663
01:43:20,330 --> 01:43:23,960
creating a soundscape
that starts off realistic,

1664
01:43:23,990 --> 01:43:28,790
but then as things sort of shift and get
more and more insane becomes more and

1665
01:43:28,791 --> 01:43:31,330
more expressive and expressionistic Dick,

1666
01:43:31,810 --> 01:43:35,770
I love the fact that people are going
to be able to see this in theaters for a

1667
01:43:35,771 --> 01:43:36,940
lot of reasons.

1668
01:43:37,900 --> 01:43:42,130
And I want to connect this to
something else that I read about you,

1669
01:43:42,470 --> 01:43:44,380
which relates to the

1670
01:43:46,420 --> 01:43:51,200
historical lack of compliance
to widget making. Uh,

1671
01:43:51,280 --> 01:43:52,220
so the story

1672
01:43:52,220 --> 01:43:55,640
of you shooting Natalie Portman for Black
Swan in the subway at something like

1673
01:43:55,641 --> 01:43:57,890
three in the morning
without necessary permits,

1674
01:43:57,891 --> 01:44:01,520
without her having signed a contract.
How do you,

1675
01:44:01,910 --> 01:44:05,330
and I don't know it nearly as many
filmmakers as you do, but I know a few.

1676
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:11,660
How do you get away with it? I mean
you, meaning you seem to be able,

1677
01:44:11,690 --> 01:44:13,100
and this is from the outside looking in,

1678
01:44:13,490 --> 01:44:18,490
but to make the art you want to make and
bend the rules or do things like that.

1679
01:44:20,690 --> 01:44:21,523
Why is that?

1680
01:44:21,680 --> 01:44:25,670
Are there certain sort of contractual
decisions or conversations you've had that

1681
01:44:25,671 --> 01:44:28,940
allow you to do it? Did you set the
precedent as like a problem child early?

1682
01:44:28,941 --> 01:44:31,610
So that's, they're just like, ah, it's
fucking Darren. So you get away with it.

1683
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:35,120
I mean it's just the project.
I, I don't think, you know,

1684
01:44:35,300 --> 01:44:39,530
it's never meant to be
abusive. I mean, I don't know,

1685
01:44:39,550 --> 01:44:43,790
but I'm just saying, I think
that's the, the, the reality
is it's, it's not abusive.

1686
01:44:43,791 --> 01:44:46,730
It's about the work.
It's always about the work.

1687
01:44:47,300 --> 01:44:51,620
And I think if you can relay back to
that, but this is about, you know,

1688
01:44:51,890 --> 01:44:55,520
US bringing this to life and the
best way, and I think, you know,

1689
01:44:55,820 --> 01:45:00,820
there were people that would take that
line of argument and turn it into abuse

1690
01:45:01,550 --> 01:45:05,660
or, or push the line to something
that's not safe or fair.

1691
01:45:06,740 --> 01:45:10,430
And I think I'm pretty empathetic
to other people's feelings.

1692
01:45:10,431 --> 01:45:13,580
Maybe to a fault because I
think some directors in May,

1693
01:45:13,970 --> 01:45:18,290
it's kind of helpful sometimes to push
past some of that pain and be blind to it.

1694
01:45:18,291 --> 01:45:21,740
But that's never, that's just not
my character. I can't do it. I,

1695
01:45:21,741 --> 01:45:26,741
I feel when people are uncomfortable very
easily and it makes me probably better

1696
01:45:27,831 --> 01:45:29,570
as a director to read performance,

1697
01:45:29,810 --> 01:45:34,070
but it probably gets me less
than what I always need.

1698
01:45:34,250 --> 01:45:39,250
Cause I feel sorry sometimes I
have mercy cause and how dare you.

1699
01:45:39,561 --> 01:45:43,760
So, yeah, but you know, I think though
that, you know, when it's the work you,

1700
01:45:43,761 --> 01:45:46,130
you just, you go for it. And
people get excited by that.

1701
01:45:46,131 --> 01:45:48,650
And if you're actually
being truthful about that.

1702
01:45:49,490 --> 01:45:53,060
But there are times and places where
I've tried to do too much and people have

1703
01:45:53,061 --> 01:45:56,930
pointed out to me, hey
that's probably, you know,

1704
01:45:57,110 --> 01:45:59,980
it's not fair for these
reasons and I hear that and,

1705
01:46:00,300 --> 01:46:03,350
and then I just listened to
myself if that's the truth or not.

1706
01:46:03,530 --> 01:46:07,880
If you have that conversation and
doesn't feel true to you, is that the,

1707
01:46:08,090 --> 01:46:13,090
is that one of the primary causes of
walking from potential projects or like

1708
01:46:13,611 --> 01:46:14,020
what,

1709
01:46:14,020 --> 01:46:19,020
and I guess all of this is sort of
coalescing into a question of if you were

1710
01:46:19,191 --> 01:46:23,810
talking to a very promising new director,

1711
01:46:23,811 --> 01:46:25,460
let's say director, maybe
they're a writer, director,

1712
01:46:25,461 --> 01:46:30,461
but they drive and you want it to
prevent them from getting chewed up or

1713
01:46:30,560 --> 01:46:31,700
corrupted by the system.

1714
01:46:31,700 --> 01:46:34,520
Is there any particular career
advice that you would give to them?

1715
01:46:34,700 --> 01:46:38,420
It's a good question. I mean, I mean,
you know, just you gotta be doing, if I,

1716
01:46:38,430 --> 01:46:41,330
I'm always from the school,
you got to do it cause you have to do it,

1717
01:46:42,180 --> 01:46:45,320
but you don't have any other choice.
But to do it.

1718
01:46:46,070 --> 01:46:51,030
Just recently I ran into a film maker and
he was sort of complaining and whining

1719
01:46:51,031 --> 01:46:56,031
about doing a TV show because he really
wanted to be making films and that and

1720
01:46:57,781 --> 01:46:58,950
then,
but you know what?

1721
01:46:58,951 --> 01:47:03,900
My advice to him was not just stick
with your gut and do what you want.

1722
01:47:04,200 --> 01:47:08,970
I could tell he was a type of guy that
should be doing that TV show because I

1723
01:47:08,971 --> 01:47:10,350
could see like he was,

1724
01:47:10,710 --> 01:47:14,100
he was already past that point where he
had crossed and he was just going to,

1725
01:47:14,520 --> 01:47:18,540
so I was like, do it. But, but then
you find people who just, you know,

1726
01:47:19,310 --> 01:47:21,480
want to do what they do and you know,

1727
01:47:21,660 --> 01:47:25,690
and then you just want to support them
and give them as much love and support to,

1728
01:47:26,620 --> 01:47:31,620
to get it because they're trying their
hardest to do something that only they

1729
01:47:32,071 --> 01:47:32,904
can do.

1730
01:47:33,340 --> 01:47:36,700
Now does that mean,
for instance,

1731
01:47:36,701 --> 01:47:40,060
I've heard this advice
with writing that writing,

1732
01:47:40,061 --> 01:47:44,330
you should only write say a book if it's
easier for you to write the book and

1733
01:47:44,331 --> 01:47:47,680
then to not write the book. Like it has
to be that much of a kind of compulsion.

1734
01:47:47,681 --> 01:47:51,360
I don't think it's ever easier to
make a movie than not make a a well,

1735
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:53,770
I guess maybe just sort of from a

1736
01:47:55,460 --> 01:47:57,350
personal right

1737
01:47:57,520 --> 01:47:58,830
pain,
pleasure standpoint.

1738
01:47:58,840 --> 01:48:01,360
Like I remember reading an
anecdote and I don't like it again,

1739
01:48:01,810 --> 01:48:04,570
who knows standard yet.
But about you,

1740
01:48:04,630 --> 01:48:06,760
I actually think this might
have been from the New Yorker,

1741
01:48:06,840 --> 01:48:11,380
a about a diary entry where you were
talking about a rave in Thailand and you

1742
01:48:11,381 --> 01:48:14,290
were like, the sun came up and
the people were dancing and,

1743
01:48:14,350 --> 01:48:19,330
and the sun came down and the people
were dancing and the tides went out and I

1744
01:48:19,331 --> 01:48:22,390
was miserable because I wasn't
making movies. Yeah, that's true.

1745
01:48:22,420 --> 01:48:26,210
That means you have to make
movies, right? I mean it's, I

1746
01:48:26,210 --> 01:48:30,830
guess so. I mean, I think for me it
was storytelling more than films,

1747
01:48:31,310 --> 01:48:35,810
although I think there would definitely
things in my past and experience that,

1748
01:48:36,100 --> 01:48:36,921
you know,
helped me.

1749
01:48:36,921 --> 01:48:40,340
Like very early on I got into photography
into black and white photography when

1750
01:48:40,341 --> 01:48:42,540
I was in junior high school and I would,
you know,

1751
01:48:43,070 --> 01:48:46,460
go into the dark room and
develop the film. I loved it.

1752
01:48:47,090 --> 01:48:50,030
And I don't know why
that fell into my lap.

1753
01:48:50,031 --> 01:48:53,960
It just so happened they had this lab
nearby and I was able to take a class

1754
01:48:53,961 --> 01:48:58,130
there and then I just started thinking
about photographs and taking pictures and

1755
01:48:58,131 --> 01:49:01,580
all that. So, and that
all led to this. Um,

1756
01:49:01,820 --> 01:49:05,570
but I think it could've gone any way.
It's funny cause when I was in college,

1757
01:49:05,571 --> 01:49:09,860
I didn't know what I wanted to do the
first couple of years I was in college.

1758
01:49:09,860 --> 01:49:14,750
I hadn't discovered filmmaking till
I was a junior in college. And, um,

1759
01:49:14,840 --> 01:49:18,120
and I remember walking around
hitting myself in the head going, oh,

1760
01:49:18,121 --> 01:49:21,710
I'm never going to find what I want. I'm
never going to find my calling, you know,

1761
01:49:22,340 --> 01:49:25,910
and then it happens for you.
Hopefully. And that happened for me.

1762
01:49:25,911 --> 01:49:27,780
I found something that I,

1763
01:49:27,860 --> 01:49:31,050
it was the first time I ever got
an a in college was filmmaking. No,

1764
01:49:31,220 --> 01:49:34,940
I was a B minus student until film
came along and suddenly, boom,

1765
01:49:35,390 --> 01:49:37,850
it was like something that kept me
out of my girlfriend's room. You know,

1766
01:49:37,851 --> 01:49:41,840
it was like, I'd rather be rather be
cutting the movie then laying in bed.

1767
01:49:41,870 --> 01:49:45,410
So I was like, um, you know,

1768
01:49:45,411 --> 01:49:48,850
I found it but uh,
I think eventually it comes and,

1769
01:49:48,880 --> 01:49:52,210
but it could have been a lot of things
I think. I don't think necessarily like,

1770
01:49:52,360 --> 01:49:56,590
I mean it's this weird kind of weird art
form and it could have probably come to

1771
01:49:56,591 --> 01:49:59,140
me in lots of different ways. It was
just something that I was like, okay,

1772
01:49:59,620 --> 01:50:02,440
I see a path,
I see something there.

1773
01:50:02,470 --> 01:50:06,250
And it's interesting and fascinating
and there's a lot to learn in there.

1774
01:50:06,820 --> 01:50:10,030
And so I just went for it.
If I were to ask,

1775
01:50:10,330 --> 01:50:14,440
say some of your closest
friends what your superpower is,

1776
01:50:14,470 --> 01:50:17,350
maybe you wouldn't talk about it cause
he seemed to be a pretty understated,

1777
01:50:17,351 --> 01:50:20,890
humble guy, but what your superpower
is or what makes you different?

1778
01:50:21,790 --> 01:50:24,280
What would they say or
what might they say?

1779
01:50:27,070 --> 01:50:31,060
I mean, my friend Dan is like, who's
doing those visual effects? For me it was,

1780
01:50:31,061 --> 01:50:33,580
I met him first day of Freshman
Year of college says, you know,

1781
01:50:33,581 --> 01:50:36,460
when people ask me, but he
changed. I say, you know what?

1782
01:50:37,450 --> 01:50:39,970
He was an asshole on college
and he's still an asshole.

1783
01:50:40,090 --> 01:50:44,070
But does my brother telling me that
that's an old breadth therefore it, yeah,

1784
01:50:44,140 --> 01:50:48,430
exactly. Exactly. I don't know.
It's hard. It's hard for me to say,

1785
01:50:48,730 --> 01:50:52,480
but definitely one of the best
things about my life has, uh,

1786
01:50:52,650 --> 01:50:55,030
as I talked about there is I
still hang out with the guys.

1787
01:50:55,031 --> 01:50:55,990
I went to nursery school.

1788
01:50:55,991 --> 01:50:57,670
I still hang out with the guys
I went to high school with.

1789
01:50:57,671 --> 01:51:01,330
I still hang out with the guys
I went to college with and um,

1790
01:51:02,290 --> 01:51:07,290
I think that that having the roots like
I'm into roots some into loyalty and I

1791
01:51:07,301 --> 01:51:11,560
think that's pro and I work with the
same filmmakers pretty much. And I think,

1792
01:51:12,550 --> 01:51:12,971
I dunno,

1793
01:51:12,971 --> 01:51:17,650
I had my friend Jed once said that the
guy who dies with the most friends wins.

1794
01:51:18,170 --> 01:51:19,510
I thought that was pretty good advice.

1795
01:51:19,990 --> 01:51:24,820
If I were to Pester your friends a
little bit more, give them a few drinks.

1796
01:51:24,850 --> 01:51:27,950
Yeah. And they get past the
obligatory, he's still an asshole.

1797
01:51:30,390 --> 01:51:33,190
If they're, if they got
to like the, the, the,

1798
01:51:33,240 --> 01:51:38,230
the point of drunk reminiscing and sort
of the emotional point of drunkenness,

1799
01:51:40,270 --> 01:51:43,510
what would they attribute your
success to? A Lot, a lot. I mean,

1800
01:51:43,511 --> 01:51:47,140
more people don't make it then make
it, you know, in the film business.

1801
01:51:48,620 --> 01:51:52,660
Ooh, it's a good question. Oh, you
attributed to, we could make it direct to,

1802
01:51:53,290 --> 01:51:57,730
I mean it's a combination. I mean, I had,
I had excellent parents, but you know,

1803
01:51:58,690 --> 01:52:03,690
almost always support me and always
told me that not to work so hard,

1804
01:52:04,990 --> 01:52:07,770
not to work too hard. You know, when I
would tell I got to go work, they'd say,

1805
01:52:07,780 --> 01:52:09,880
well, don't work too
hard. Was there saying I,

1806
01:52:09,881 --> 01:52:13,620
I mean that was after I got out of
college. So up to college they put,

1807
01:52:13,630 --> 01:52:16,870
they were both school teachers
and academics was super important,

1808
01:52:17,530 --> 01:52:19,870
but they also created a lot of,
um,

1809
01:52:20,380 --> 01:52:24,550
they created very good
responsibility and boundaries,

1810
01:52:24,551 --> 01:52:28,270
but also, um, didn't necessarily
create opportunities,

1811
01:52:28,271 --> 01:52:30,400
but gave me breathing room,

1812
01:52:30,970 --> 01:52:35,680
would support to find opportunities.
So I struggled in my twenties,

1813
01:52:35,681 --> 01:52:40,570
but I was able to struggle in my
twenties. Um, and so that, that was,

1814
01:52:40,750 --> 01:52:41,081
that was,

1815
01:52:41,081 --> 01:52:46,081
I think a big part was having that
type of support system and my sister,

1816
01:52:46,131 --> 01:52:48,650
so family was a major part of it.

1817
01:52:50,090 --> 01:52:54,060
And I think that allowed me to
have persistence, you know, um,

1818
01:52:54,290 --> 01:52:58,940
which I always say is nine tenths of
the game is persistence is, you know,

1819
01:52:59,030 --> 01:53:03,170
you gotta get up to the plate, you know,
to get that chance, to take that swing,

1820
01:53:03,680 --> 01:53:08,600
uh, and to get to the plate just
takes a lot of work. Um, but then,

1821
01:53:08,660 --> 01:53:11,150
and then when you get there,
it's preparation and homework.

1822
01:53:11,840 --> 01:53:15,980
Having done all your homework and um,
as well as you can,

1823
01:53:15,981 --> 01:53:19,100
as much as you can and then,

1824
01:53:19,130 --> 01:53:23,960
and then as you're taking the swing is
make it a responsible swing for the team.

1825
01:53:24,260 --> 01:53:27,200
You know, make sure that that
I, I love the baseball metaphor.

1826
01:53:27,200 --> 01:53:28,610
I wonder how much longer I can keep going

1827
01:53:30,800 --> 01:53:35,600
with your students. You teach, what is the
name of the class? I don't see, I mean,

1828
01:53:35,601 --> 01:53:38,570
I don't do it regularly because
I haven't found the best place.

1829
01:53:38,571 --> 01:53:43,550
I taught at Nyu for a bit and um,
a few other places. But I mean,

1830
01:53:43,551 --> 01:53:46,610
I just, I, I just to be honest,

1831
01:53:46,611 --> 01:53:50,860
I kind of wing it to see what kids are
doing. You know, I'll come in, I'll,

1832
01:53:50,870 --> 01:53:55,400
I'll talk to them about what their dreams
are, what their projects are. I'll ask.

1833
01:53:55,550 --> 01:54:00,230
They all sort of share. So I have them
all described each other's stuff. But I,

1834
01:54:00,270 --> 01:54:04,500
I love doing scene study with kids where
I have them put up a scene and bring

1835
01:54:04,550 --> 01:54:07,370
work with actors. Put up
a scene. Now this is a,

1836
01:54:07,430 --> 01:54:09,740
this is a scene that has
already peered, no, no, no, no.

1837
01:54:09,820 --> 01:54:12,170
I've seen from their projects,
they describe it to me.

1838
01:54:12,171 --> 01:54:15,290
They tell me what they want.
They'll put up the scene and then I'll,

1839
01:54:15,350 --> 01:54:18,890
I'll teach them, I'll give them my,
my direction on how I would block it.

1840
01:54:18,891 --> 01:54:20,270
I'll work with the actors,

1841
01:54:20,540 --> 01:54:23,540
I'll just show them my process and then
I'll pick a truck bought out and I'll

1842
01:54:23,541 --> 01:54:25,700
show them, let's see, how
would we, how do we shoot it?

1843
01:54:26,180 --> 01:54:28,420
And I'll just draw my designs
to show them how to draw.

1844
01:54:28,460 --> 01:54:32,270
So I give him a chalkboard is sort of
bird's eye view. Always bird eye's view.

1845
01:54:32,300 --> 01:54:35,630
That's how I've always, I, I came up,
I mean I know the filmmakers do it,

1846
01:54:35,631 --> 01:54:40,070
but it was when I was 1920
years old starting to do films.

1847
01:54:40,071 --> 01:54:41,150
That's how I started.
I always,

1848
01:54:41,151 --> 01:54:44,450
and it's probably from playing dungeons
and dragons as a kid, it was like,

1849
01:54:44,510 --> 01:54:44,781
you know,

1850
01:54:44,781 --> 01:54:49,490
you get that sky view and like I drew
little triangles and I came up with all

1851
01:54:49,491 --> 01:54:50,870
these different shapes and forms.

1852
01:54:50,870 --> 01:54:55,400
I have my own like language that I've
developed over the years for how to do it

1853
01:54:55,401 --> 01:55:00,401
and I have the ability to look at that
architectural plans and then to see it in

1854
01:55:00,591 --> 01:55:03,530
three d below so I can,
that's how I do it.

1855
01:55:03,531 --> 01:55:05,030
I do it very much from a bird eye view.

1856
01:55:05,330 --> 01:55:07,850
Dungeons and dragons will
be for round two. I was,

1857
01:55:07,950 --> 01:55:12,590
I was always a chaotic
good cleric Plus Gray Elf.

1858
01:55:13,720 --> 01:55:17,810
Elf. Yeah. You're a cleric. No, no, I,
I don't remember that. Well actually,

1859
01:55:17,811 --> 01:55:21,470
I mean we played for ever, but I
don't actually remember my character.

1860
01:55:21,480 --> 01:55:25,160
I'll bring some graph paper next time.
If you were to,

1861
01:55:25,161 --> 01:55:28,370
this is related to the class, let's
just say you could no longer make films.

1862
01:55:28,610 --> 01:55:29,060
Right.

1863
01:55:29,060 --> 01:55:34,060
And your sort of divinely assigned to
mission was to coach five five to 10

1864
01:55:36,590 --> 01:55:37,610
filmmakers.
Yeah.

1865
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:41,840
And not only would you get the
psychic reward of seeing them do well,

1866
01:55:41,841 --> 01:55:44,060
but much like say who bankroll

1867
01:55:44,060 --> 01:55:48,360
is a poker player,
you would get a percentage of the future.

1868
01:55:48,900 --> 01:55:53,100
What are the things you would focus on
if you had say, a six month period? Well,

1869
01:55:53,101 --> 01:55:56,340
I mean if I was doing that
and I had a share of it, yeah,

1870
01:55:57,210 --> 01:56:00,820
I mean as soon as you bring the share
into it, it's like a, all right,

1871
01:56:01,070 --> 01:56:04,230
so that we could, we could, we could, we
get approached as a couple different ways.

1872
01:56:04,231 --> 01:56:08,280
So one is you get the profit share,
it's like a 50 50 split with them.

1873
01:56:08,281 --> 01:56:11,100
Plus you have a kicker, but you have to
add some money. All right, we can do that.

1874
01:56:12,150 --> 01:56:16,660
I would never do that. I this is
this only investments. Awful invests.

1875
01:56:16,670 --> 01:56:19,540
This is force. That's what we have
huge Chinese companies for it.

1876
01:56:19,541 --> 01:56:23,640
But the other could be really whatever
reward you would want to get out of it.

1877
01:56:23,641 --> 01:56:28,641
So it could be the acclaim and
receiving awards and prizes and so on.

1878
01:56:29,520 --> 01:56:31,730
It could be anything else.
But I mean really,

1879
01:56:32,360 --> 01:56:34,550
I mean the, the real, I guess,

1880
01:56:34,760 --> 01:56:39,760
I mean the gift of any teachers to see
whatever the goals of the student are,

1881
01:56:40,701 --> 01:56:45,470
as long as they are righteous
goals be achieved, you know. So,

1882
01:56:45,880 --> 01:56:50,390
you know, I would probably want to
teach students that were, you know,

1883
01:56:50,750 --> 01:56:55,460
probably had just wanted to tell good
stories and then I would want them to see

1884
01:56:55,461 --> 01:56:56,294
them,

1885
01:56:56,510 --> 01:57:01,510
make them as well as they could and then
have them connect with as many people

1886
01:57:01,730 --> 01:57:06,650
as they could. The awards, the
money, that's all silly stuff.

1887
01:57:06,680 --> 01:57:08,390
I mean,
it's great for everything,

1888
01:57:08,391 --> 01:57:12,890
but it's really has as many
issues with it as good things.

1889
01:57:13,400 --> 01:57:15,920
So, um, I mean it's,

1890
01:57:15,921 --> 01:57:19,970
it's just you want to find people and I'd
want to find students that really just

1891
01:57:19,971 --> 01:57:23,270
want to tell stories and entertain and
they not that they want to be a filmmaker

1892
01:57:23,271 --> 01:57:28,271
quicker because where the rock star of
the present day or the NBA basketball

1893
01:57:28,431 --> 01:57:32,390
player of the day, you know, where it's
because that's what they want to do.

1894
01:57:32,420 --> 01:57:36,890
Like when I started telling stories,
it wasn't like when I was a kid,

1895
01:57:37,280 --> 01:57:42,200
no one knew what Spielberg did.
We heard the name Lucas and Spielberg.

1896
01:57:42,201 --> 01:57:46,790
But that was it, you know, but
not really, you know, no one,

1897
01:57:46,850 --> 01:57:48,920
how do you become a director?
And when I started to do it,

1898
01:57:48,921 --> 01:57:52,580
even in the early nineties,
it wasn't really,

1899
01:57:52,610 --> 01:57:56,960
it was early Sundance days. It wasn't
really this track record of how to do it.

1900
01:57:57,500 --> 01:58:01,070
So I wasn't like looking for
the reason to be, you know,

1901
01:58:01,610 --> 01:58:04,760
that it could lead to
something that was clear.

1902
01:58:04,820 --> 01:58:07,160
It was just something that was
interesting and fascinating to me.

1903
01:58:07,161 --> 01:58:11,890
So at this point when there are
all these paths too, you know, um,

1904
01:58:12,020 --> 01:58:15,050
fame and money and all that and you know,

1905
01:58:15,051 --> 01:58:19,220
if you make one film you can go and do
a marvel movie or something like that,

1906
01:58:19,250 --> 01:58:20,930
which is happening all the time now.

1907
01:58:21,350 --> 01:58:25,550
I think you want to find people that
are looking to tell the stories and then

1908
01:58:25,551 --> 01:58:29,420
help them tell stories. And like when
I, the last class I taught at Nyu,

1909
01:58:29,870 --> 01:58:34,700
my best student was a Turkish kid who
was going back to Turkey to tell a small

1910
01:58:34,701 --> 01:58:37,220
story about an apple tree on the,
on the,

1911
01:58:37,280 --> 01:58:42,100
on the side of mount are at that
starts a village fight and tiny story.

1912
01:58:42,160 --> 01:58:43,840
It could be huge,
who knows?

1913
01:58:44,500 --> 01:58:46,720
But he was serious and you
just wanted to tell that story.

1914
01:58:46,721 --> 01:58:50,350
And so I gravitated to him and I spent
most of my time in the class working with

1915
01:58:50,351 --> 01:58:54,520
him to help him because he was the guy
who was going to go make a movie and was

1916
01:58:54,521 --> 01:58:57,250
serious and knew what he was doing.
And I said,

1917
01:58:57,850 --> 01:59:00,520
let me focus on this kid
so the other kids can see,

1918
01:59:01,480 --> 01:59:04,330
be inspired by his path.
Any

1919
01:59:05,010 --> 01:59:08,580
top scripts, if somebody has never read
a screenplay and you're like, look,

1920
01:59:08,581 --> 01:59:11,460
just start,
start with a

1921
01:59:11,550 --> 01:59:15,540
BC. I mean, the guy's working
today, Eric Roth, Scott silver,

1922
01:59:15,930 --> 01:59:20,160
read any of their scripts that great
writers. I'm Chris Terrio. I mean,

1923
01:59:20,161 --> 01:59:23,650
there's a lot of great writers working
right now. I mean there's, there's,

1924
01:59:23,660 --> 01:59:26,640
there's a lot of good, great
scripts that I've read. I mean,

1925
01:59:26,641 --> 01:59:29,610
Charlie Kaufman scripts
are great and fun to read.

1926
01:59:29,860 --> 01:59:34,690
It's enough to start with. Yeah, I think
so. Where can people find the film?

1927
01:59:34,750 --> 01:59:39,550
Where should they learn more about it?
I've never had something. Yes, exactly.

1928
01:59:40,090 --> 01:59:43,690
And I've had just for everybody listening,
I highly recommend you check it out.

1929
01:59:44,610 --> 01:59:49,030
Like Darren said, like, no, you're
signing up for a roller coaster.

1930
01:59:49,390 --> 01:59:50,560
And uh,

1931
01:59:50,561 --> 01:59:55,030
but I've had nothing
produce this really unique.

1932
01:59:55,630 --> 01:59:58,420
I'll get yelled at for modifying unique
by someone I know, but that's okay.

1933
01:59:58,930 --> 02:00:00,970
I'm going to just for him,
very unique,

1934
02:00:01,300 --> 02:00:05,520
a dreamlike state for about 18 hours
afterwards. It was amazing. Yeah,

1935
02:00:05,590 --> 02:00:09,290
it was really profound. But
where can people learn more
about it? Well, I mean it's

1936
02:00:09,370 --> 02:00:12,010
mother with a low case.
I'm in an exclamation point,

1937
02:00:12,011 --> 02:00:16,570
which causes all different
type of difficulties with
social media because of the

1938
02:00:16,571 --> 02:00:21,040
exclamation point. But, um, I mean
by the time this comes out, I hope,

1939
02:00:21,390 --> 02:00:26,050
uh, it's going to be
around, um, if not, um,

1940
02:00:26,080 --> 02:00:30,700
you know, uh, that, I mean just
Google mother movie and you'll,

1941
02:00:30,701 --> 02:00:32,590
you'll be seeing a bunch of bat it out,
I hope.

1942
02:00:33,030 --> 02:00:34,110
Where can people,

1943
02:00:34,111 --> 02:00:37,660
if they want to check you out on social
media or was that something else?

1944
02:00:38,870 --> 02:00:43,860
Full name Darren Aronofsky ad on
Instagram and a Twitter. Yeah,

1945
02:00:43,940 --> 02:00:46,760
that's, I, I, you know,
Instagram is pretty cool. I've
been doing this cool thing.

1946
02:00:46,761 --> 02:00:47,870
I don't know if you've been following it,

1947
02:00:47,871 --> 02:00:52,730
but I found two young film students
and they were moving out to go to film

1948
02:00:52,731 --> 02:00:57,731
school in La and I rented them a big
projector and a cube truck and they'd been

1949
02:00:58,311 --> 02:00:59,840
driving through the country,

1950
02:00:59,900 --> 02:01:04,900
projecting the word mother in different
languages onto all different types of

1951
02:01:05,061 --> 02:01:08,840
structures around the country.
And so I've been posting these,

1952
02:01:08,841 --> 02:01:13,120
emit these beautiful images that these
young filmmakers have been making, um,

1953
02:01:13,640 --> 02:01:16,820
to help sell, promote my
film. But also, um, it's,

1954
02:01:16,821 --> 02:01:20,450
it's been a fun project to learn about
all these different places all over

1955
02:01:20,451 --> 02:01:23,590
America. It's kind of humans of New
York, is that humans have, sure.

1956
02:01:23,630 --> 02:01:26,970
Is that the name of the Cummins in
New York? Humans of New York. But, um,

1957
02:01:27,170 --> 02:01:28,730
more projections of mother.

1958
02:01:30,410 --> 02:01:34,370
Very cool. So people can say hi to
you on the interweb, check it out.

1959
02:01:35,090 --> 02:01:36,800
Any last,
uh,

1960
02:01:36,980 --> 02:01:41,550
asks or recommendations of
people listening besides
seeing the movie? I mean,

1961
02:01:41,551 --> 02:01:46,500
just keep, uh, keep seeing
the weird stuff. Go out and,

1962
02:01:46,501 --> 02:01:50,580
you know, let you know, support when
you, and then spread the word, you know.

1963
02:01:50,581 --> 02:01:52,740
So I think, you know,
if you dig the movie,

1964
02:01:52,741 --> 02:01:54,690
get it out there and get
everyone to go see it.

1965
02:01:55,250 --> 02:01:59,670
I'm hoping that it's type of film that
you'll want to talk to other people about.

1966
02:01:59,970 --> 02:02:04,200
Well, I will, I can attest certainly
with two people I saw it with,

1967
02:02:04,770 --> 02:02:06,210
we talked about it for hours afterwards.

1968
02:02:06,211 --> 02:02:08,920
So one of the things I
really enjoyed his head,

1969
02:02:09,630 --> 02:02:14,320
this is not follow the typical template.
Any typical template.

1970
02:02:14,530 --> 02:02:17,830
Yeah. And that I can, that I can see.
So it leads to a lot of conversation.

1971
02:02:18,100 --> 02:02:21,520
Dare to be different, dare
to be different. Well Darren,

1972
02:02:21,521 --> 02:02:24,310
I really appreciate the time. Thank
you to Sam. It's an amazing, yeah,

1973
02:02:24,311 --> 02:02:26,890
this has been really fun and
we, we can, we can keep going,

1974
02:02:26,891 --> 02:02:29,150
but I want to let you get
back to his film. Yeah,

1975
02:02:29,920 --> 02:02:33,820
well then polishing up everything
and to everybody listening,

1976
02:02:33,821 --> 02:02:37,990
you can find links to everything
we've discussed, including the movie,

1977
02:02:38,190 --> 02:02:43,180
the books and so on in the show notes at
tim.blog/podcast as per usual and every

1978
02:02:43,181 --> 02:02:47,650
other episode. And until next time,
thank you for listening. Bye Bye.

1979
02:02:48,150 --> 02:02:51,510
Hey guys, this is Tim again. Just a
few more things before you take off.

1980
02:02:51,870 --> 02:02:54,510
Number one,
this is five bullet Friday.

1981
02:02:54,810 --> 02:02:57,810
Do you want to get a short email from me?

1982
02:02:57,811 --> 02:03:00,420
Would you enjoy getting a short
email from me every Friday?

1983
02:03:00,690 --> 02:03:04,950
That provides a little more soul of
fun before the weekend and five bullet

1984
02:03:04,951 --> 02:03:09,570
Friday is a very short email where I share
the coolest things I've found or that

1985
02:03:09,571 --> 02:03:11,130
I've been pondering over the week.

1986
02:03:11,370 --> 02:03:14,130
That could include favorite new
albums that I've discovered.

1987
02:03:14,131 --> 02:03:17,580
It could include Gizmos and gadgets
and all sorts of weird shit that I've

1988
02:03:17,581 --> 02:03:21,900
somehow dug up in the uh,
the world of the esoteric as I do.

1989
02:03:22,200 --> 02:03:27,200
It could include favorite articles that
I've read and that I've shared with my

1990
02:03:27,870 --> 02:03:30,570
close friends for instance.
And it's very short.

1991
02:03:30,660 --> 02:03:35,640
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness
before you head off for the weekend.

1992
02:03:35,670 --> 02:03:37,860
So if you want to receive that,
check it out.

1993
02:03:38,130 --> 02:03:43,080
Just go to four hour work week.com that's
four hour workweek.com all spelled out

1994
02:03:43,140 --> 02:03:45,960

you will get the very next one.

1995
02:03:46,230 --> 02:03:48,060
And if you sign up,
I hope you enjoy it.

1996
02:03:48,570 --> 02:03:52,530
This episode is brought to you by audible,
which I've used for many, many years.

1997
02:03:52,590 --> 02:03:55,130
I absolutely love audio books.
And there.

1998
02:03:55,140 --> 02:03:58,260
One of my favorite ways to
pass the time when I travel,

1999
02:03:58,320 --> 02:04:02,550
I'm on the road all the time and audible
allows me to consume many more books

2000
02:04:02,551 --> 02:04:06,900
than I possibly could otherwise I have
to audio books to recommend right off the

2001
02:04:06,901 --> 02:04:10,860
bat. The first is perhaps my favorite
audio book of all time and it's the only

2002
02:04:10,861 --> 02:04:13,380
audiobook I've wanted to
listen to twice in a row.

2003
02:04:13,830 --> 02:04:17,940
The graveyard book by Neil Gaiman.
It's amazing and you will thank me.

2004
02:04:18,420 --> 02:04:19,860
There are a few different versions.

2005
02:04:20,130 --> 02:04:22,920
I like the version that
Neil narrates himself,

2006
02:04:23,370 --> 02:04:25,440
one of the most soothing
voices of all time.

2007
02:04:25,770 --> 02:04:30,150
The second book is vagabonding
by Rolf hots, p, o t t,

2008
02:04:30,180 --> 02:04:33,870
s which had a huge impact on my life
and formed the basis for a lot of what

2009
02:04:33,871 --> 02:04:36,030
would later become the four hour workweek,

2010
02:04:36,450 --> 02:04:40,980
so go to audible.com forward slash Tim

This episode is brought
to you by wordpress.

2020
02:05:11,311 --> 02:05:16,140
My goto platform for blogging, writing
online, creating websites, everything.

2021
02:05:16,500 --> 02:05:20,100
I love wordpress to bits.
My site,

2022
02:05:20,160 --> 02:05:25,160
every site just about that I have is run
on wordpress and the lead developer of

2023
02:05:25,621 --> 02:05:30,570
wordpress, Matt Mullenweg has
appeared on this podcast many times.

2024
02:05:31,260 --> 02:05:35,520
The very first episode in particular is
amazing. Second, I took a ton of notes on,

2025
02:05:35,790 --> 02:05:39,690
so he's checking out, but
wordpress, where do I even begin?

2026
02:05:39,750 --> 02:05:43,560
I mean the New Yorker uses it,
Jay z, Beyonce, they use it.

2027
02:05:43,710 --> 02:05:45,840
Five 38 tech crunch, Ted, CNN.

2028
02:05:45,841 --> 02:05:50,250
Time with you're looking to create
a personal blog, a business site,

2029
02:05:51,060 --> 02:05:53,250
both, neither. Something else.

2030
02:05:53,310 --> 02:05:58,310
You'll make a huge impact when you
build your website on wordpress.com and

2031
02:05:58,860 --> 02:06:02,880
directly from some friends at Google.
I'm not going to quote them by name,

2032
02:06:02,881 --> 02:06:07,830
but they say that wordpress offers
the best out of the box SEO.

2033
02:06:07,890 --> 02:06:12,150
That's search engine optimization
imaginable, so if you're on wordpress,

2034
02:06:12,420 --> 02:06:17,420
you immediately have a leg up on everybody
else on search engines and so forth.

2035
02:06:17,640 --> 02:06:22,590
In my experience, I'm no medical
doctor of search engine optimization,

2036
02:06:22,591 --> 02:06:27,591
but I will say that I used wordpress
for years and it fell in love with it to

2037
02:06:28,740 --> 02:06:33,690
the extent that I became very close
friends with Matt and then became an

2038
02:06:33,691 --> 02:06:36,990
investor slash advisor to automatic,

2039
02:06:37,020 --> 02:06:40,650
which runs wordpress.com that is how much
I believe in this and that's how a lot

2040
02:06:40,651 --> 02:06:45,651
of my most successful products and
investments have come about because I'm in

2041
02:06:45,931 --> 02:06:48,570
love with x and then I seek out x.

2042
02:06:48,840 --> 02:06:53,840
Nearly 30% of the Internet
is run on wordpress and that
includes everything from

2043
02:06:54,301 --> 02:06:58,770
the huge sites that I mentioned to
neighborhood sites and it is super easy to

2044
02:06:58,771 --> 02:07:02,460
get started. There's no need to worry
about security or upgrades or hosting.

2045
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:06,000
They offer 24 seven support
and handle all of that,

2046
02:07:06,030 --> 02:07:11,030
which allows you to focus on creating
the highest quality content you can with

2047
02:07:11,251 --> 02:07:14,490
the least amount of friction.
I don't have to worry about downtime.

2048
02:07:14,790 --> 02:07:18,600
I don't want to have to
worry about getting emergency
emails if I'm on vacation

2049
02:07:18,601 --> 02:07:23,040
or something like that, and wordpress
is my goto solution for all of this.

2050
02:07:23,041 --> 02:07:28,041
I trust all of my most important
text on the Internet to wordpress,

2051
02:07:29,400 --> 02:07:32,670
and they can't buy that with
a sponsorship. They can't
buy that with anything.

2052
02:07:32,880 --> 02:07:36,070
I want uptime, uptime,
uptime, and quality,

2053
02:07:36,071 --> 02:07:39,220
and that is what I have selected
after everything that I've looked at.

2054
02:07:39,520 --> 02:07:41,410
So check it out.
Go to wordpress.

2055
02:07:41,470 --> 02:07:46,470
That's w o r d p r e s s.com wordpress.com
forward slash Tim to receive 15% off

02:07:49,180 --> 02:07:50,410

02:07:50,800 --> 02:07:54,520
That's wordpress.com forward slash Tim.
