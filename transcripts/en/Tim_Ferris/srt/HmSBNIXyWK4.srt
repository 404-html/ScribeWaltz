1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,890
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02,891 --> 00:00:06,210
I can run flat out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,120
I'm a cybernetic organism living.

4
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:27,020
This episode is brought
to you by four sigmatic,

5
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:32,140
founded by the Genius Fin's who
lit the Internet on fire and a,

6
00:00:32,251 --> 00:00:34,010
you may have heard of
their mushroom coffee,

7
00:00:34,011 --> 00:00:38,600
which features Chaga and lion's mane,
which has taken Silicon Valley by storm.

8
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:41,540
I use it pretty much every day,

9
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:46,470
either that or the Chaga,
which is decaf as a separate version,

10
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:50,040
and I use both of these primarily
for focus and productivity.

11
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,390
They just get you going let
you up like a Christmas tree,

12
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,130
so definitely check it out.

13
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,810
People are always asking me what I use
for cognitive enhancement and for right

14
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:05,460
now this is the answer. I try to
force this on all of my house guests.

15
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:09,840
It is a hell of a thing if
I have employees or people
come over who are working

16
00:01:09,841 --> 00:01:10,591
on projects with me,

17
00:01:10,591 --> 00:01:14,430
I always try to feed it to them because
I'm going to get the limitless effect

18
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,110
and get a lot more out of them.

19
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,150
The first time I mentioned this product
and four sigmatic on the podcast,

20
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,340
their product sold out
in less than a week,

21
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:25,560
so you may want to check them out soon.

22
00:01:25,561 --> 00:01:28,860
If you're listening to this and
the coffee tastes like coffee,

23
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,580
it takes just seconds to
prepare with hot water.

24
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,750
And oddly enough only includes
40 milligrams of caffeine,

25
00:01:36,751 --> 00:01:39,600
so it has less than half of what
you'd get in a regular cup of coffee.

26
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:43,980
I don't get any jitters, acid reflux
or any stomach burn, any of that.

27
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,320
It's very unusual and very,
very cool.

28
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,070
So if you don't like caffeine,

29
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:52,790
they also offer very strong but
caffeine free mushroom elixirs,

30
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:56,660
which I will sometimes have
in the evening. I find Chaga
specifically to be very,

31
00:01:56,661 --> 00:01:59,600
very grounding and earthy.
So that is another option.

32
00:01:59,601 --> 00:02:03,260
And I have a cupboard full of
their products, uh, at the moment,

33
00:02:03,261 --> 00:02:06,350
which is right around the corner of
my kitchen. You can try something,

34
00:02:06,351 --> 00:02:07,910
you can try a sample pack,
which is great.

35
00:02:07,911 --> 00:02:12,710

39
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:28,070
if you are in the experimental mindset,
I do not think you'll be disappointed,

40
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:32,470
so try them out.
Well,

41
00:02:32,471 --> 00:02:33,460
hello boys and girls.

42
00:02:33,461 --> 00:02:36,850
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another
episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

43
00:02:36,851 --> 00:02:41,530
it is my job to tease out the
habits, routines, belief systems,

44
00:02:41,531 --> 00:02:46,060
life lessons from people who were the
best of what they do and the to hopefully

45
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:49,510
give you an opportunity to test
those things in your own life.

46
00:02:49,511 --> 00:02:53,410
And this episode we have
a power couple in fact,

47
00:02:53,411 --> 00:02:58,411
but let's go back in time to around 2009
or 2010 when was given a tee shirt and

48
00:03:00,821 --> 00:03:05,821
the tee shirt was an Avatar as in
the film and Avatar staff t shirt.

49
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:10,480
And on the front was a quote and the
quote was, hope is not a strategy.

50
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:14,080
Luck is not a factor.
Fear is not an option.

51
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:20,220
It is tributed to James Cameron who
is part of the dynamic duo who will be

52
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:23,650
featured in this episode.
Who's James Cameron.

53
00:03:23,651 --> 00:03:28,060
You ask James Cameron is a filmmaker
and deep sea explorer. He is writer,

54
00:03:28,061 --> 00:03:32,950
director and producer of many films
including the Terminator Aliens,

55
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:37,600
the Abyss Terminator Two true
lies, titanic and Avatar,
both titanic and Avatar.

56
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:41,320
The highest grossing film of All time won
the Golden Globe for best director and

57
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:44,760
Best Picture and were nominated
for a record number of awards.

58
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:49,270
Cameron was also at the vanguard of the
d renaissance developing cutting edge

59
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:54,271
three d camera systems as an explorer in
2012 cameras set the world's solo deep

60
00:03:54,971 --> 00:03:59,971
diving record of 35,787 feet in the
challenger deep in a vehicle of his own

61
00:04:02,021 --> 00:04:02,600
design.

62
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:07,150
He is dedicated environmentalist and
he has founded the Avatar alliance

63
00:04:07,151 --> 00:04:10,540
foundation to take action on climate
change, energy policy, deforestation,

64
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:13,690
indigenous rights, ocean conservation
and sustainable agriculture.

65
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:17,890
He's currently in production on
average are two three, four and five.

66
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:22,600
You can find him on
Twitter at Jim Cameron.

67
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:27,130
Susie Amos Cameron, his wife is
a noted environmental advocate,

68
00:04:27,131 --> 00:04:31,780
mother of five and the author of o m d,
which is one meal a day.

69
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:35,140
Omd Subtitle, the simple plant
based program to save your health,

70
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:39,850
save your waistline, and save the planet.
And the founder of the OMD movement,

71
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:43,540
a multipronged effort to transform
eating habits and the food system.

72
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:48,160
She's also a founder of plant power task
force focused on showing the impact of

73
00:04:48,161 --> 00:04:50,920
animal agriculture on climate
change in the environment.

74
00:04:50,921 --> 00:04:53,410
Founded in 2012 with her husband.

75
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,000
That is Jim and Craig McCaw.
In 2005 she founded Muse School,

76
00:04:58,001 --> 00:05:02,770
the first school in the country to be
100% solar powered with zero waste and a

77
00:05:02,771 --> 00:05:06,430
100% organic plant based lunch program.
Additionally,

78
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,710
she is founder of verdant foods,

79
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:13,980
Cameron family farms and
food forest organics along
with red carpet green dress.

80
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:18,550
As an actor,
she's been featured in more than 25 films,

81
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:23,320
including the usual suspects and titanic.
You can find her online. Facebook,

82
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:27,070
Susie, a Cameron. That's
Susie Suz. Why Twitter?

83
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:31,960
Suzy musing and Instagram.
Susie Amos. Cameron,

84
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,960
a few housekeeping notes right up front.

85
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:40,020
There are two other episodes that I'm
publishing simultaneously with James and

86
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,900
Susie on the tribe of mentors podcast.

87
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,920
Want to do an experiment and split things
up a little bit for a whole host of

88
00:05:47,921 --> 00:05:48,754
reasons.

89
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,620
In the shorter episode that you'll
find on the tribe of mentors podcast,

90
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:59,130
I include their answers to some of my
common questions including what is bad

91
00:05:59,331 --> 00:06:03,740
advice you often hear in your areas of
expertise are in your industry and I'll

92
00:06:03,741 --> 00:06:05,570
give you a teaser for that.

93
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:10,340
Do what you love is is one of the answers
that is elaborated on favorite books,

94
00:06:10,341 --> 00:06:14,210
books that had been most gifted to
others and then the favorite failures.

95
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:17,900
So failures they have learned the
most from. And the second episode,

96
00:06:17,901 --> 00:06:22,490
which is going to be on the tribe mentors
podcast is the full audio also not to

97
00:06:22,491 --> 00:06:24,980
be missed,
there's a bonus in text.

98
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,490
So James Mentions in the full audio
that unlike on previous films,

99
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:33,491
he did not get sick during
the simultaneous filming
slash production of Avatar

100
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,290
two and three, which is astonishing
considering as he put it,

101
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,490
that quote,

102
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,820
they meaning all staff know coming in
when they sign up that it's going to be

103
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:47,360
the most difficult production in human
history and quotes. So how did he do it?

104
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,600
He credits his stamina and health
during that period to his new routine,

105
00:06:53,001 --> 00:06:55,550
including plant based diet,
supplements, exercise and so on.

106
00:06:55,551 --> 00:07:00,551
So I asked him for a concrete daily
calendar with exact food supplements times

107
00:07:01,941 --> 00:07:03,710
and so on,
which he provided.

108
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:08,330
So you can find James Super dialed in
daily routine for after our two and three

109
00:07:08,331 --> 00:07:11,300
at Tim dot.
Blog forward slash a James Cameron,

110
00:07:11,301 --> 00:07:14,600
that's tim.blog four slash James Cameron.
All right,

111
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:18,710
so some of you who are long
term listeners have no doubt,

112
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:23,750
heard multiple guests on to discuss
the Ketogenic Diet to discuss,

113
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,040
uh,
alternate approaches to food and health.

114
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:32,840
And I thought that this episode would be
a good opportunity to give some airtime

115
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,000
to discussion of plant based diets.

116
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:40,390
And it should also be underscored that
there are chapters in the four hour body,

117
00:07:40,701 --> 00:07:45,701
two of them with the legendary ultra
endurance athletes got jerk about plant

118
00:07:45,801 --> 00:07:50,300
based diets and even if
you disagree with uh,

119
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:55,390
perhaps plant based diets or any of the
arguments you might hear from Suzy and

120
00:07:56,001 --> 00:08:00,560
James that suggest listening for
at least three reasons. Number one,

121
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:05,570
there's plenty of non plant talk and we
jumped right into it with discussion of,

122
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,500
of how they both respond to
feeling overwhelmed or distracted.

123
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,150
The second is patients.

124
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:15,560
In this podcast I do my
best to in a gentle way,

125
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,780
sometimes not so gentle,
but often a gentle way,

126
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:21,980
expose people to different viewpoints,

127
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:24,260
different perspectives in the world,

128
00:08:24,261 --> 00:08:27,710
which is why I have on
very often for instance,

129
00:08:27,711 --> 00:08:32,660
someone who's highly religious like
rabbi Jonathan Sacks and then I will have

130
00:08:32,661 --> 00:08:33,590
just a few episodes later,

131
00:08:33,591 --> 00:08:37,610
someone like Sam Harris who is phd in
neuroscience and very well known for being

132
00:08:37,611 --> 00:08:38,270
an atheist.

133
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:42,360
I might have someone who is far left and
then someone who is far right because I

134
00:08:42,361 --> 00:08:45,680
like to focus on some of the commonalities
and also the thought processes.

135
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:48,320
The only way you can
understand your argument,

136
00:08:48,321 --> 00:08:52,520
your position best is to also
understand the opposing viewpoints.

137
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:57,180
Or it says number two, this is an exercise
in, especially in these divisive times.

138
00:08:57,181 --> 00:09:01,390
I think it is a worthwhile
exercise. And third, Omd,

139
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,970
one meal per day that is plant based.
Uh,

140
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:10,070
I would recommend even if you don't plan
on converting to fully plant based as a

141
00:09:11,911 --> 00:09:15,840
consciousness practice and an exercise,
which is something I very often do,

142
00:09:15,841 --> 00:09:18,690
I will, I will impose certain
constraints on my eating,

143
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:24,080
eliminate a certain food product or I
will insist that I eat based on a spectrum

144
00:09:24,451 --> 00:09:29,451
of color as a way to make my subconscious
or automatic behaviors I eat.

145
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:34,260
Eating more conscious is that I'm
more aware of what I am doing and the

146
00:09:34,261 --> 00:09:35,880
decisions I am making.

147
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:41,330
So those are a few of the many reasons
I would suggest listening to this.

148
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:44,520
And without further ado,

149
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:48,930
let's just jump right into it
with Suzy and James Cameron.

150
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:56,880
Well, haul off baby. Well, Tim,
first of all, we want to say hi.

151
00:09:56,881 --> 00:09:59,310
And when we first met you,

152
00:09:59,311 --> 00:10:03,930
we were all flying around and
the parabolic flight with um,

153
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:07,620
well Ilan Musk and bunch
of other crazy folks. Yeah.

154
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:11,100
So that was doing somersaults
in zero g super fun.

155
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,880
Super Fun. So, hey Tim, sorry

156
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:18,010
that's on the show or we're,
we're honored to be here.

157
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:23,440
Yeah, really, really excited. I guess
you still call a podcast a show?

158
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:26,560
I guess you can, yeah, yeah,
the Tim Ferriss show. Oh, cool.

159
00:10:26,561 --> 00:10:29,350
Then I guess if it's called the Tim
Ferriss show, then it's gotta be a show

160
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:37,430
when you feel overwhelmed or unfocused
or have lost your focus temporarily.

161
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:42,480
What do you do if helpful?
What questions do you ask yourself?

162
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,420
So what do I do when I feel overwhelmed?

163
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:52,040
Uh, uh, clean off my desk, cause whatever,

164
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,670
I'm working at a high pace, you
know, everything piles up and uh,

165
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:59,370
just the act of cleaning off my desk,
like a reset.

166
00:10:59,371 --> 00:11:03,110
It's like re it's like power
cycler computer to reboot. And I,

167
00:11:03,111 --> 00:11:06,720
I usually find that about half the
stuff that's accumulated I can throw out

168
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:11,700
[inaudible]. And the other half I have
to, I have to put in piles, you know,

169
00:11:11,701 --> 00:11:15,030
I have to put them in the right place. So
now I'm prioritizing. Now I'm thinking,

170
00:11:15,031 --> 00:11:19,170
oh well that's, that's still important.
So I think that, you know, the, if you're,

171
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,400
if you're a team leader,

172
00:11:20,401 --> 00:11:23,160
you've got to get your own priorities
straight before you can generate

173
00:11:23,161 --> 00:11:24,870
priorities for the,
for the team.

174
00:11:24,871 --> 00:11:27,120
And I've found that whenever
I hit one of those moments,

175
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:31,620
I also find it's great to take a
day off, uh, or even half a day off.

176
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:35,070
Just force yourself to take a
day off, not, not to go play,

177
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:39,450
but to just reorganize.
Right. And just, you know,

178
00:11:39,451 --> 00:11:44,340
Kinda right now on the series of
priorities are kind of memos to yourself.

179
00:11:44,341 --> 00:11:44,851
And out of that,

180
00:11:44,851 --> 00:11:48,960
I typically will generate things that I
hand out to my team to give them their

181
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:51,570
marching orders to kind
of get us back on track.

182
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:57,080
And it's amazing things just pop into
focus and solutions present themselves

183
00:11:58,511 --> 00:12:00,190
because I haven't stopped running.

184
00:12:00,191 --> 00:12:05,050
I haven't gotten off the
treadmill until that moment to uh,

185
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:08,060
you know, to, to lift my head
out of the day to day battle,

186
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,990
to think about how are we going
to really win this war, right.

187
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:14,440
It was something like a big film
production is, is, is like a,

188
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,540
a campaign that takes place over sometimes
a period of years. And if you don't,

189
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:23,110
if you don't take a moment out to
kind of look at the big picture.

190
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,710
So most of the major strategic
decisions that I've made during the,

191
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:30,580
during the productions of the two avatar
films so far over the last couple of

192
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:34,690
years have come from that, that
down day, right? That catch up day.

193
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,780
It's not about taking a day off,
taking a nap. That's a good idea too.

194
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,053
And you know,

195
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,010
go swim or play with the kids or
whatever and you've got to do that too.

196
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:45,370
But just take a day for
yourself with no distractions,

197
00:12:45,371 --> 00:12:48,910
to just get everything in order.
That helps me a lot. If nothing else,

198
00:12:48,911 --> 00:12:52,570
I just feel better about it. Right?
I come in, there's a clean desk,

199
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,000
here's some memos.
You guys go do the work.

200
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,750
Well, I think we're really
similar on that. I mean, I,

201
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:02,190
I have a tendency to walk through the
House and get ridiculously overwhelmed

202
00:13:02,191 --> 00:13:02,761
with,
you know,

203
00:13:02,761 --> 00:13:07,761
all the kids and the cats and the
dogs and the bearded dragon people.

204
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:13,590
Yeah. So I always like to go in
and just reorganize the house,

205
00:13:13,591 --> 00:13:18,370
but I always start with my office as well.
And I,

206
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:22,630
I like to take a big piece of typing
paper and write out, you know,

207
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:27,270
I create columns and I write out all my
emails that I need to do in all my calls

208
00:13:27,271 --> 00:13:28,051
that I need to do.

209
00:13:28,051 --> 00:13:31,200
And then there's a whole section
in there just for household things,

210
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,070
work things and all of those.
And you know,

211
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:40,020
I know that the children are learning
this as well because when they,

212
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:44,100
you know, of course they roll their eyes
when I walk in and say, okay, we're gonna,

213
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,800
we're gonna take a clean day,
an organizing day,

214
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:51,060
and here's some boxes for giveaways.
They roll their eyes,

215
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:55,620
but in the end they love it and they
feel better and get into it and they get

216
00:13:55,621 --> 00:14:00,010
into it. So it's, it's, um,
it's the same sort of thing and,

217
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:02,880
and taking a walk and then realizing like,
okay,

218
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:08,240
what is the first thing I can do that's
going to get me on that journey towards

219
00:14:08,911 --> 00:14:12,300
my, towards my goal. But always
keeping that goal in mind of,

220
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,150
of whatever that is. You know, sometimes

221
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:18,290
best way to solve a problem is a
walk away from it for a second. Yeah.

222
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,460
It's counterintuitive for us type type
a types it to bash our heads against the

223
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:26,870
problem all day long. Boom, boom, boom,
boom. [inaudible] day after day. You know,

224
00:14:26,871 --> 00:14:29,660
I had an epiphany while
I was writing avatar.

225
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:33,890
It was working down in New Zealand.
Um, office was kind of in the,

226
00:14:33,891 --> 00:14:37,550
in the country and um, you
know, I was just having a,

227
00:14:37,551 --> 00:14:40,730
it was just impossible to solve some of
the dramatic problems. I just couldn't,

228
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:44,180
I couldn't solve it. I couldn't fix
the script and I was sitting there.

229
00:14:44,181 --> 00:14:46,790
I just walked away. I
sat down, sat outside,

230
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:51,791
and there was a glass cover to the veranda
and I watched this big fly and he was

231
00:14:53,001 --> 00:14:58,001
trying to get out and he was banging
against the glass and he just kept hitting

232
00:14:58,611 --> 00:15:03,200
the glass over and over and over and over
because that's how his little chip was

233
00:15:03,201 --> 00:15:04,820
programmed.
You go toward the light,

234
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:08,930
you go toward the sky and
he couldn't get to the sky,

235
00:15:08,931 --> 00:15:12,920
only had to do was drop down,
fly three feet sideways and come out.

236
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:16,340
But he couldn't process it. And I
thought, how often am I that fly?

237
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:21,610
How often is there some higher level of
perspective that I lack in my chip that

238
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:23,624
I'm missing?

239
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,260
That is so simple that some
fourth dimensional being
could look at the problem,

240
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:31,550
will go, oh you idiot, you just dropped
down. Go over three feet and you're out.

241
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:35,750
But the fly couldn't do it. And I
thought, what am I not seeing? You know?

242
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,700
And that's when I went back to
first principles and I looked,

243
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:43,340
I looked at the whole thing from a,
from a higher level.

244
00:15:43,341 --> 00:15:47,420
I'd got out of the trenches for
that moment. And that's how I,

245
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,830
that's how I solved the problem.

246
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:55,180
I think also too is learning when to
recognize when you're hitting that window

247
00:15:56,690 --> 00:16:01,690
and also learning to recognize when it's
the path of least resistance because

248
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:05,720
you know you're on the right
path when doors just continue to,

249
00:16:05,721 --> 00:16:07,600
oh well that's true.
That's the opposite. When,

250
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:11,570
when that's the other thing is important
to recognize when things are breaking

251
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:15,110
away way when when you have momentum,

252
00:16:15,111 --> 00:16:19,790
when you're not hitting the glass,
you take advantage of it and you,

253
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:23,510
you ride that tailwind.
There's a difference too. It's,

254
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:27,050
it's when you know you want
to do something and you
feel really strongly about

255
00:16:27,051 --> 00:16:29,720
it and you have a lot of
people around you saying, no,

256
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:34,520
oh well you shouldn't do it and
it's going to be too hard and that,

257
00:16:34,521 --> 00:16:36,260
I mean I know it works for you that way,

258
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:38,960
but I mean that just lights
and Ferno under my butt.

259
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:43,960
It's like okay really no watch me and I
love to say that to my team on Avatar.

260
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:48,590
Oh well we shouldn't do that guys.
Cause that's to be hard. Exactly.

261
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,620
When the,
when they know coming in,

262
00:16:51,621 --> 00:16:56,510
when they sign up that it's going to be
the most difficult production in human

263
00:16:56,511 --> 00:16:57,020
history.

264
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:02,020
Just by its nature where
every blade of grass in,

265
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:05,630
in, in, in the entire world
that we're creating is done,

266
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,610
is created by somebody,

267
00:17:07,611 --> 00:17:11,210
by a computer artists or by some kind
of algorithm that's self growing or

268
00:17:11,211 --> 00:17:15,740
whatever. You know by definition it's
going to be, it's going to be hard.

269
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:19,880
You're there because it's hard and you're
doing it because it's hard. You know?

270
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:24,050
That's because that's how you measure
yourself against that challenge and that's

271
00:17:24,051 --> 00:17:27,710
why everybody's that's on
the Avatar team is, is there,

272
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:31,610
cause they know it's going to be the
hardest motherfucker they ever work on and

273
00:17:31,611 --> 00:17:33,080
they want that now.

274
00:17:33,081 --> 00:17:36,320
They'll all go whine about it later and
say that was the hardest motherfucker I

275
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:39,830
ever worked on it and that's why I have
this reputation as a cruel task master.

276
00:17:39,831 --> 00:17:42,890
But in fact they've all showed
up because they want to do that.

277
00:17:42,891 --> 00:17:45,530
They want to climb that mountain
and they've learned from it. I mean,

278
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:48,290
that's how they're like the teachers
that mute their teaching in a way.

279
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:50,160
They've never,
nobody teaches

280
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,890
that way and it's really challenging.

281
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:56,220
But they learn now the kids don't like
holidays because they don't get to go to

282
00:17:56,221 --> 00:17:57,054
school.

283
00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:02,050
If you could have one gigantic
billboard anywhere with anything on it,

284
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,490
metaphorically speaking, getting a
message out to millions or billions,

285
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:08,590
what would it say and why?

286
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:13,540
Could be a few words or a paragraph if
helpful. It can be someone else's quote.

287
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:17,590
Are there any quotes you can
think of or live your life by?

288
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:23,410
Yeah, I'm terrible with
quotes and that sort of thing,

289
00:18:23,411 --> 00:18:24,244
but I think I would,

290
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:29,700
I would sum up philosophically
what I would ask people to do,

291
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:34,540
which is to live in a more connected way,

292
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:39,280
to see yourself as part of a big global
system and know that every action you

293
00:18:39,281 --> 00:18:44,140
take has a consequence.
Every choice you make as a consumer,

294
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:48,910
whether it's, you know, using
plastics are using electricity or,

295
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,740
or replacing that,

296
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:54,760
that iPhone that's only six months
old because there's a better one,

297
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:56,163
um,

298
00:18:56,350 --> 00:19:01,350
that that has an impact on somebody
somewhere or some animal somewhere or some

299
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:07,480
ecosystem somewhere that,
you know, um, when I,

300
00:19:07,481 --> 00:19:10,510
when I look at the history of
the human race up until now,

301
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,930
and this all doesn't go on the billboard,
by the way,

302
00:19:13,931 --> 00:19:16,720
I want to try to cut that this down,
but I look at the history.

303
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,250
Up until now we've been all about
expansion. It's an endless hunger to,

304
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:26,050
to conquer and expand and, and, and, and
we've, we've filled the planet where like,

305
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:30,550
um, we're like a bacterial culture that
that rapidly expands to the edge of the

306
00:19:30,551 --> 00:19:33,970
petri dish while we're hitting
the edge of the petri dish now.

307
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:37,630
And so everything that always worked
throughout human history is not going to

308
00:19:37,631 --> 00:19:38,740
work going forward.

309
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:42,670
We're going to have to have some
fundamental change in the way we think.

310
00:19:42,671 --> 00:19:47,671
We're going to have to stop being takers
and start being caretakers or we won't

311
00:19:48,221 --> 00:19:51,760
survive. It's that simple. Now,
maybe, maybe it's 50 years,

312
00:19:51,761 --> 00:19:53,800
maybe it's a hundred years,
maybe it's 200 years,

313
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:58,300
but it's not going to go on the way it's
been going on and we're going to have

314
00:19:58,301 --> 00:20:01,450
to change.
And I think it's a change for the better.

315
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:05,620
It's a change that's more empathic,
it's more compassionate. It, you know.

316
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:08,890
So I guess I would say stop
being a taker or, or take,

317
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:13,450
take less and caretake more.
And I mean that very generally as well.

318
00:20:13,451 --> 00:20:18,160
Think about how decisions that you make
and things you do are affecting people

319
00:20:18,161 --> 00:20:20,140
in other, in other countries. You know,

320
00:20:20,141 --> 00:20:22,660
all those people that are coming
up in that big care event,

321
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:25,480
a lot of them have been displaced by,
by drought.

322
00:20:25,481 --> 00:20:28,450
Their farms have collapsed and they can't
grow there. They can't grow their food.

323
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:33,370
It's not just about drug violence and all
that sort of thing. Uh, especially in a,

324
00:20:33,371 --> 00:20:37,110
in a water mala, uh, there
are, there are, you know,

325
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,380
hundreds of thousands,

326
00:20:38,381 --> 00:20:41,470
if not millions of people on the move
from farms that have collapsed due to

327
00:20:41,471 --> 00:20:42,970
unprecedented drought.
That's,

328
00:20:42,971 --> 00:20:47,630
that's drier conditions than
they've ever had in recorded. And,

329
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:49,270
and,
um,

330
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,350
the ability of science to look back
hundreds of thousands of years.

331
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:55,300
Well that's climate change at work.

332
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,710
And if that particular series of droughts
is not caused specifically by climate

333
00:20:59,711 --> 00:21:00,041
change,

334
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:05,041
it's a pretty damn good bellwether
for what it's going to look like when

335
00:21:05,591 --> 00:21:06,910
hundreds of thousands and then,

336
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,820
and then ultimately a hundreds of millions
of people are on the move because of

337
00:21:09,821 --> 00:21:10,481
climate change.

338
00:21:10,481 --> 00:21:14,560
So the choices that we're making in our
energy consumption and our consumption

339
00:21:14,561 --> 00:21:18,730
of natural resources in our
consumption of foods is impacting,

340
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:22,310
um, other people in other
parts of the world. Uh,

341
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:25,030
it'll eventually come back to haunt us,
uh,

342
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:28,370
with the kinds of political
systems that are now, uh, you know,

343
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:33,340
taking over all over the
world, these protectionist,
isolationist, nationalistic,

344
00:21:33,341 --> 00:21:36,790
hyper nationalistic
populist systems that are,

345
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,510
that are about closing borders and
shutting down and all that sort of thing.

346
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:43,810
I see it all interlink
and I see it all as a,

347
00:21:43,811 --> 00:21:46,600
as a feedback loop that's just
going to get worse and worse.

348
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:51,370
So I would say we have to change this
from the inside out from the way we view

349
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:56,020
the world. And our place
in it. And um, so yeah,

350
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:59,980
stop being a taker. Start being a
caretaker right now. That's my billboard.

351
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,790
Can about the timeline.

352
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:07,080
The United Nations just came out a
couple of weeks ago with a report.

353
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:08,063
Um,

354
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:13,340
and from the IPC saying that we have
to do something by 2032 to turn things

355
00:22:16,921 --> 00:22:20,910
around if we are going
to survive on this earth.

356
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,310
And you know,
one of the things that,

357
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:27,690
that I really resonate with is the,

358
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:33,090
the native American tribes, the
first nations, they always say,

359
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:35,070
no matter what you're doing,

360
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:39,840
realize that it's going to affect
the next seven generations.

361
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:44,820
So just being really conscious in your
everyday actions and tread lightly.

362
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,100
Tread lightly on the earth.

363
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:52,430
Yeah. Yeah. I mean not look,

364
00:22:52,431 --> 00:22:54,410
we all struggle to do it and we're not,

365
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:57,320
we don't want to come off as holier
than now. That's the thing about,

366
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:01,760
about vegans in general. As they
all, they're all such, you know,

367
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,660
assholes. Tell your joke. Okay,

368
00:23:05,661 --> 00:23:09,560
how many vegans does it take to screw
in a light bulb? Doesn't matter.

369
00:23:09,561 --> 00:23:13,200
We're better than you. All. Right,
right, right. So, you know, so the, the,

370
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:17,120
the problem is people tend
to reject, reject what, um,

371
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:21,080
you know what, we could tell them
all right. But I, I, you know,

372
00:23:21,081 --> 00:23:24,110
I think the answer to that is say,
well don't, don't take our word for it.

373
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:26,000
Read the books.
It's all online.

374
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:31,600
The problem is that people
tend to entrench around
their belief systems and now

375
00:23:31,731 --> 00:23:35,540
with, with the, with
digital news the way it is,

376
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:37,550
we can pre select the inputs,

377
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:42,050
we can pre select our inputs to
support only what we already believe.

378
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:44,900
And so everybody lives in these,

379
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:48,620
in these kind of isolated echo chambers,
you know,

380
00:23:48,621 --> 00:23:52,550
and it's all exacerbated by,
by social media and so on.

381
00:23:52,551 --> 00:23:55,340
And so it's really going to be another
thing that we're going to have to just

382
00:23:55,341 --> 00:23:57,110
get a whole lot better at as a,

383
00:23:57,230 --> 00:24:02,230
as a species and as a society is checking
our facts and looking at alternative

384
00:24:04,221 --> 00:24:07,670
opinions and especially look at the,
at the facts that the, that the,

385
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,700
that the other guys have,
if to have any,

386
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,080
yeah.

387
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:17,400
I just did a little calm from confirmation
bias swerve at the end there. Yeah.

388
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:18,320
If the avenue,

389
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:23,950
yeah. Right. Exactly. Um, alright,

390
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:26,830
so next question.

391
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,950
What are you currently most excited about?

392
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:33,350
Um,
all right.

393
00:24:33,351 --> 00:24:38,270
I'm not going to talk about about plant
based nutrition other than to say for

394
00:24:38,271 --> 00:24:43,271
one second that I was pretty hopeless
about being able to get a handle on

395
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,560
climate change.

396
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:49,130
Just looking at it from
an energy perspective and
transportation and all that.

397
00:24:49,131 --> 00:24:49,910
And,

398
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:54,530
and when I realized the environmental
connection from eating plant based,

399
00:24:54,531 --> 00:24:55,670
I got excited about that.

400
00:24:55,671 --> 00:24:58,070
But that's kind of old news because
that's six years ago for us.

401
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:01,370
I guess right now I'm excited
about the Avatar films I get,

402
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:03,560
I have the coolest job in the world.
I get to go in and,

403
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:08,480
and create a world and ecosystem populated
with creatures and cool characters

404
00:25:08,481 --> 00:25:13,100
and do that all day long and uh, you
know, live in that fantasy world.

405
00:25:13,101 --> 00:25:14,750
So yeah,
I'm pretty excited about it.

406
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:19,140
Yeah. So just to piggy back on, you know,

407
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:23,640
feeling hopeful because I am going
to talk about plant based eating. Uh,

408
00:25:23,641 --> 00:25:28,641
Jim actually has a t shirt and one
of the lines on it says hope is not a

409
00:25:29,011 --> 00:25:33,270
strategy. And um, he's
a doomsday kind of guy.

410
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,490
He watches movies,

411
00:25:35,491 --> 00:25:40,491
they're kind of like the end of the world
apocalyptic and he never used the word

412
00:25:42,811 --> 00:25:43,350
hope.

413
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:47,490
And six and a half years ago we were
walking on the beach and he said to me,

414
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:53,190
for the first time in my life, I
feel hopeful. And needless to say,

415
00:25:53,191 --> 00:25:55,620
I almost, you know, fell into the surf,

416
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,310
but it's planted a seed, you know, that,

417
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:02,880
that the more people we can
inspire to eat, plant based,

418
00:26:02,881 --> 00:26:05,280
the more we can move the
needle on climate change.

419
00:26:05,281 --> 00:26:10,281
And it was that seed that was planted
that made me think about creating content

420
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:17,770
and writing a book.
And I'm most excited about about the book,

421
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:23,210
about my book and MD changing
one meal a day for the planet.

422
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:29,180
And it starts out with the
education of the health.

423
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:33,810
I worked with a brain trust of doctors,
so it's very,

424
00:26:33,811 --> 00:26:38,430
very heavily researched in the medical
field around plant based eating.

425
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:42,900
And then I worked with people from
Chatham House and Oxford University in La,

426
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,620
Loma Linda,
climate scientists to help me with the,

427
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:51,060
the environmental impacts of animal
agriculture. And then it's a guide.

428
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,740
It's a guide of how to do one
meal a day or two meals a day,

429
00:26:55,741 --> 00:26:58,410
or blow up your kitchen
like Jim and I did.

430
00:26:58,411 --> 00:27:02,760
And go cold Turkey as recipes,
shopping lists, meal plans,

431
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:07,370
and I'll hold your hand.
I won't judge you. It's,

432
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:11,130
it's not about being perfect.
You can keep your burger if you want to.

433
00:27:11,131 --> 00:27:14,580
It's just about one meal
a day. Oh, M d. Right.

434
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:18,840
So I think there's one more question
there is one more question. Um,

435
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:21,450
if you had a request,

436
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:26,880
an ask or suggestion for the listeners
of this podcast, what would it be?

437
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:29,950
Oh,
I think people that listen to,

438
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:34,390
to Tim and his guests are looking for
a hacks to make their life better,

439
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:40,000
uh, to, to learn how to live in
this, this perplexing world and, and,

440
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:44,770
and live better and kind of be
smarter. So I think that, uh, you know,

441
00:27:44,771 --> 00:27:49,630
I would just say, read a lot,
check your facts. And, uh,

442
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:53,980
you know, don't, don't, don't follow us
because we're so sweet and compelling.

443
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:58,610
Check the facts.
Just the facts ma'am.

444
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:03,380
Yeah, I mean, you know, it's
all out there, but I would
say also take to take the,

445
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:05,180
uh,
uh,

446
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:09,890
be willing to look outside
your confirmation bias bubble.

447
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,090
And I, I like, I,

448
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,980
I forced and challenge myself to do
this all the time to get outside that,

449
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:21,410
to get outside that bubble. Um, and so,
you know, whatever your beliefs are,

450
00:28:21,411 --> 00:28:23,570
ask yourself one where they came from,

451
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:29,230
when did you double down on that and
what have you done to look at it sort of

452
00:28:29,271 --> 00:28:34,010
from an objective point
of view. Um, and you know,

453
00:28:34,011 --> 00:28:36,650
I tried to do that as much as possible
and then something comes along that I

454
00:28:36,651 --> 00:28:40,590
don't understand that doesn't fit my
belief system. Like, uh, you know,

455
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:41,810
let me just give an example.

456
00:28:41,811 --> 00:28:46,050
Like Allan Savory's approach to
regenerative agriculture with, you know,

457
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,250
grass fed beef and all the claims
that were made around that.

458
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:52,610
I looked into it and I thought,
wow, maybe there's something here.

459
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:55,960
And I went pretty far down the
rabbit hole on that before and,

460
00:28:55,961 --> 00:28:57,960
and looked at the science on,

461
00:28:57,961 --> 00:29:02,840
on both sides of it and ultimately
saw that it wasn't the right answer,

462
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:06,710
but uh, but I didn't just reject it
out of hand because it didn't fit my,

463
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:10,810
my, you know, my belief system. Right.

464
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:16,750
Well I think my ask would
be to take the OMD pledge,

465
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:22,140
they pledge one meal a day or two meals
a day or go all in because it will help

466
00:29:24,551 --> 00:29:28,270
your health and it'll help the
planet. It'll help your, the animals,

467
00:29:28,271 --> 00:29:32,980
your waistline and your sex life. Yes,
yes. Not necessarily in that order.

468
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:38,590
Anyway. Um, thanks Tim. This was,

469
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:42,070
this was really fun and for having us on.

470
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,170
It's been a pleasure.
Thank you. Yeah, thank you.

471
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:49,020
Hey guys, this is Tim again. Just a
few more things before you take off.

472
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:51,990
Number one,
this is five bullet Friday.

473
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:55,290
Do you want to get a short email from me?

474
00:29:55,291 --> 00:29:57,900
Would you enjoy getting a short
email from me every Friday?

475
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:02,430
That provides a little more soul of
fun before the weekend and five bullet

476
00:30:02,431 --> 00:30:07,050
Friday is a very short email where I share
the coolest things I've found or that

477
00:30:07,051 --> 00:30:08,610
I've been pondering over the week.

478
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:11,610
That could include favorite new
albums that I've discovered.

479
00:30:11,611 --> 00:30:15,030
It could include Gizmos and gadgets
and all sorts of weird shit that I've

480
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:19,380
somehow dug up in the other
world of the esoteric as I do.

481
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:24,680
It could include favorite articles that
I've read and that I've shared with my

482
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:28,050
close friends for instance,
and it's very short.

483
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:33,090
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness
before you head off for the weekend.

484
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:35,340
So if you want to receive that,
check it out.

485
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:40,260
Just go to a four hour work week.com

486
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:44,160

488
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:49,710
This episode is brought
to you by four sigmatic,

489
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:54,800
founded by the Genius Fin's who lit
Internet on fire and you may have heard of

490
00:30:55,561 --> 00:30:59,130
their mushroom coffee,
which features Chaga and lion's mane,

491
00:30:59,131 --> 00:31:01,260
which has taken Silicon Valley by storm.

492
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:06,770
I use it pretty much every
day either that War II Chaga,

493
00:31:07,051 --> 00:31:12,030
which is a separate version and I use
both of these primarily for focus and

494
00:31:12,031 --> 00:31:17,010
productivity. They age get you going
let you up like a Christmas tree,

495
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,780
so definitely check it out.

496
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:23,490
People are always asking me what I use
for cognitive enhancement and for right

497
00:31:23,491 --> 00:31:28,170
now this is the answer. I try to
force this on all of my house guests.

498
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:32,520
It is a hell of a thing if
I have employees or people
come over who are working

499
00:31:32,521 --> 00:31:33,271
on projects with me,

500
00:31:33,271 --> 00:31:37,140
I always try to feed it to them because
I'm going to get the limitless effect.

501
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:38,790
It's a lot more out of them.

502
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:43,830
The first time I mentioned this product
and four sigmatic on the podcast,

503
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,020
your product sold out in less than a week,

504
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:48,240
so you may want to check them out soon.

505
00:31:48,241 --> 00:31:51,480
If you're listening to this and
the coffee tastes like coffee,

506
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:56,750
it takes just seconds to prepare with
hot water and oddly enough only includes

507
00:31:57,991 --> 00:31:59,340
40 milligrams of caffeine,

508
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:02,250
so it has less than half of what
you'd get in a regular cup of coffee.

509
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:06,630
I don't get any jitters, acid reflux
or any stomach burn, any of that.

510
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:11,730
It's very unusual and very, very
cool. So if you don't like caffeine,

511
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:15,480
they also offer very strong,
but caffeine free mushroom elixirs,

512
00:32:15,481 --> 00:32:19,350
which I will sometimes have
in the evening. I find Chaga
specifically to be very,

513
00:32:19,351 --> 00:32:20,820
very grounding and earthy.

514
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:25,170
So that is another option and I have
a cupboard full of their products, uh,

515
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:27,210
at the moment, which is right
around the corner of my kitchen.

516
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:30,600
You can try something. You could
try sample pack, which is great.

517
00:32:30,601 --> 00:32:35,601
Also right now by going to
foursigmatic.com/tim that's four Sigmatic,

518
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,140
f, O, u, R, s, I, g, m, a, t, I,

519
00:32:39,141 --> 00:32:44,141
c.com/tim and use the Code Tim Tim to
get 20% off of your first order and

520
00:32:45,441 --> 00:32:48,650
they're not that expensive anyway,
if you are in the experimental mindset,

521
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:51,420
I do not think you'll be
disappointed to try mine.
