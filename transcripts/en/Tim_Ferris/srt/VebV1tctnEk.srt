1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,870
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02,871 --> 00:00:06,870
I can run flat out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking. No else.

3
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:08,683
Now

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,070
I'm a cybernetic organism living.

5
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,870
This episode is brought
to you by a cent protein,

6
00:00:26,871 --> 00:00:31,871
the cleanest least process protein I've
ever consumed and I have tried just

7
00:00:32,271 --> 00:00:35,510
about everything since well
before the four hour body.

8
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:39,170
I've started my day with
20 to 30 grams of protein.

9
00:00:39,171 --> 00:00:41,210
First thing that has
been part of my routine,

10
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:45,950
but I don't always have the time or
necessarily the desire to cook an entire

11
00:00:45,951 --> 00:00:47,540
meal.
So what to do.

12
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:52,460
Protein powders can be a fast way
to get this protein needs met,

13
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:56,690
but most products are full of crap.
They're bleached, they have excess sugar,

14
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:00,590
terrible artificial sweeteners or
just straight forward low grade,

15
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,800
low quality protein ascent contains zero
artificial ingredients and the parent

16
00:01:06,771 --> 00:01:08,390
company is actually a cheese manufacturer,

17
00:01:08,391 --> 00:01:12,890
so they produce their own native proteins.
It's,

18
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:17,030
it's really fascinating and I've looked
at they're processing it takes where it

19
00:01:17,031 --> 00:01:19,130
took them about five years to develop.

20
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:24,290
You can mix the protein in as little as
four ounces without any clumps or issues

21
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:28,100
of mixed ability whatsoever.
And they nailed the taste.
They tested, for instance,

22
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:32,510
the chocolate version
282 different versions.

23
00:01:32,511 --> 00:01:37,511
They put a lot of money and a lot of
time into r and D for this particular

24
00:01:37,581 --> 00:01:42,130
product. If you love coffee, they also
have a brand new cappuccino flavor,

25
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,530
which is a variation I've enjoyed.

26
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,970
If you prefer to test something outside
of the traditional vanilla or chocolate

27
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,280
and they have both way
and my seller casing,

28
00:01:51,281 --> 00:01:56,170
so if you want to say improve body
composition and recovery overnight

29
00:01:56,290 --> 00:02:00,490
slow-release, you can take the my seller
casein or in my case, whey protein.

30
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:04,360
I would take postworkout for instance,
or in the morning, so check it out.

31
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,770
These guys were really fascinating.

Hello Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls.

69
00:04:20,711 --> 00:04:24,070
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another
episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

70
00:04:24,071 --> 00:04:28,240
each episode is my job to
tease out the habits, routines,

71
00:04:28,241 --> 00:04:32,740
belief systems, decision
making, frameworks, whatever
it might be, backstories,

72
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:33,551
failures,

73
00:04:33,551 --> 00:04:38,170
and what they've learned from them that
you can borrow from performers and apply

74
00:04:38,171 --> 00:04:41,230
in your own lives in some fashion.
In this episode,

75
00:04:41,231 --> 00:04:44,020
we're going to feature three guests,
so [inaudible],

76
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:48,550
Susan Cain and Graham Duncan and I
won't get into their bio's right now.

77
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:51,390
So mentioned Nani was introduced
to me by Brian complements.

78
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:56,170
Some of you may know as the cocreator
of the hit show billions as well as a

79
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:57,280
filmmaker,
writer,

80
00:04:57,281 --> 00:05:01,360
director known for
flicks such as rounders,

81
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:05,080
the illusionist, and the
list goes on and on. Uh,

82
00:05:05,081 --> 00:05:09,610
Susan Cain speaking myself as someone who
considers himself an introvert who can

83
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:12,250
for short periods,
pretend to be an extrovert.

84
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,930
What she writes about is
very, very applicable to my
own life. And Graham Duncan,

85
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:21,550
very understated person who tends to
stay out of the public eye out of the

86
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,940
limelight. And you may notice for
those of you who spotted the names,

87
00:05:24,941 --> 00:05:27,100
all three of them are
featured in my latest book,

88
00:05:27,101 --> 00:05:31,690
tribe of mentors that Grim Duncan has
no social media profiles in the book.

89
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:34,390
And that tells you a lot about Graham.

90
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:38,740
All three of them I should
note share something in common.

91
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:43,690
And that is that I would view
all three is people who are very,

92
00:05:43,691 --> 00:05:46,390
very expert at mitigating risk.

93
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:51,420
So I don't view them as a throw
caution to the wind risk at all bunch

94
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:53,950
whatsoever.
Nonetheless,

95
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:59,130
they had been very good at capping
the downside and making various career

96
00:05:59,931 --> 00:06:04,160
decisions and bets that have paid
off. Very, very, very, very large.

97
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:08,770
So I hope you enjoy this as much as I did.
And uh,

98
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:12,590
I will let these three brilliant
guests take it from here.

99
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:20,780
Our guest today is so chain
Nani on Twitter at [inaudible],

100
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,830
s o m a n c h, a, I n a n,

101
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:29,570
I on Instagram at [inaudible] c
or you can find more about him.

102
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:34,590
So [inaudible] dot net soman is a detailed
planner filmmaker in New York Times

103
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:37,460
bestselling author,
his debut fiction series.

104
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:40,280
The school for good Knievel has
sold more than a million copies,

105
00:06:40,281 --> 00:06:43,670
has been translated into more than
20 languages across six continents,

106
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,670
and will soon be a film
from universal pictures,

107
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:50,900
a graduate of Harvard University and
Columbia University's Mfa Film Program.

108
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:54,950
So in began his career as a screenwriter
and director with his films playing at

109
00:06:54,951 --> 00:06:57,410
more than 150 film
festivals around the world.

110
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:02,620
He was recently named to the out 100 and
has received the $100,000 Shasha grant

111
00:07:02,811 --> 00:07:06,140
and Sun Valley Writers Fellowship,
both for debut writers.

112
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:13,030
So the right book can slip right inside
of you and somehow wake up the part of

113
00:07:13,031 --> 00:07:14,020
you that's asleep.

114
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:18,970
It can actually put words to the thoughts
that your soul can quite get ahold of

115
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,620
without at least a little help.

116
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:23,350
And there's so many books
that have done this for me,

117
00:07:23,351 --> 00:07:26,830
but there's three in particular that
I've read over and over and over.

118
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:31,270
The first is the war of art by Steven
Pressfield, which is this slim,

119
00:07:31,271 --> 00:07:33,620
tiny little book about the
creative process. It's,

120
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:38,650
it's almost like a Tao te
Ching for artists that every
time you read that you go

121
00:07:39,401 --> 00:07:44,260
deeper and deeper into
this idea of overcoming the
innate resistance that faces

122
00:07:44,261 --> 00:07:47,830
anybody who wants to make a change in
their life, especially a creative one,

123
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,810
and every time I read it at lights,

124
00:07:49,811 --> 00:07:54,811
this crazy bonfire inside of me that
reminds me just how far I have to go in

125
00:07:55,361 --> 00:07:59,830
order to trust the creative voices
inside of me instead of the eagle voices.

126
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,760
Because that's the real crisis with our
creative work is that it requires us to

127
00:08:03,761 --> 00:08:06,570
trust the silent voices, the
ones that we actually, you know,

128
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:11,580
don't hear as loud as the positive and
negative ones that are always judging the

129
00:08:11,681 --> 00:08:12,610
work that we do.

130
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:16,630
And it's easy to mix all these voices up
and end up quietly abandoning your own

131
00:08:16,631 --> 00:08:19,120
ambition often before you
even start your project.

132
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:24,580
These eagle voices are also why I became
a pharmaceutical consultant at 21 years

133
00:08:24,581 --> 00:08:28,990
old hocking Viagara instead of writing
fantasy books and movies like I do now,

134
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:33,250
because at the time of pharmaceutical
consultant belt, like a safe job,

135
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:37,240
the kind of normal job that you tell
your parents about and they tell their

136
00:08:37,241 --> 00:08:40,360
friends about and makes you feel like
you're doing something right with your

137
00:08:40,361 --> 00:08:41,140
life.

138
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:46,090
And so these ego voices are also why I'm
afraid to date Ivy Leaguers, I guess,

139
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,060
even though I reluctantly
have to admit that I am one,

140
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:52,980
because when you go to an Ivy
League school, you're tagged as,

141
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:57,990
as a success before even accomplished
anything before you even know who you are.

142
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:01,580
And so it's stokes this very fragile
sense of self and it makes you play

143
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,760
completely safe. And ultimately to
make any real progress in my own life,

144
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,470
I had to decondition myself from my own
education and really believed that I had

145
00:09:10,471 --> 00:09:14,190
nothing to lose. So yes,
Pressfield's war of art.

146
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:19,150
That's where I would say the yellow
brick road starts for a second book, um,

147
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:23,700
uh, to something unusual, which is
a little life by Hanya Yanagihara,

148
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:27,450
which is a whopper of a novel that tracks
the friendship of four male friends in

149
00:09:27,451 --> 00:09:30,600
New York City over the
course of almost 40 years.

150
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:34,020
You honestly won't find a book
more polarizing or divisive,

151
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:37,110
but to me it's the greatest
work of fiction I've ever read,

152
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,590
primarily because it hits a nerve that
I've struggled with my whole life,

153
00:09:40,591 --> 00:09:45,591
which is that all of us have baggage
and wounds and pain that have shaped the

154
00:09:46,111 --> 00:09:50,130
way we see the world. But we so
often hide it or compartmentalize it.

155
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,061
And because of that,

156
00:09:51,061 --> 00:09:54,900
we close off parts of ourselves
and make our lives a lot smaller.

157
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:58,860
A little life reminds us that the pain
we feel is shared and it's a common human

158
00:09:58,861 --> 00:10:00,930
bond.
We shouldn't be ashamed of it.

159
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:03,540
And that if we talk about
it and shine a light on it,

160
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:07,530
it's the first step to becoming a whole
person instead of a fragmented one.

161
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:13,190
I honestly can't imagine a more
ambitious or healing or moving book.

162
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,850
But what's also funny is that a lot of
people hate a little life and consider it

163
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:22,100
the worst book ever written. Um, my
brother despises it and he says, quote,

164
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:26,460
it's trash. Basically the
literary equivalent of
rubbernecking at a car accident.

165
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,770
So take that for what you will. Uh, Tim,

166
00:10:28,771 --> 00:10:31,140
if any of your listeners ended
up reading a little life,

167
00:10:31,141 --> 00:10:34,230
I'd be curious to hear
which camp they end up then.

168
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:38,700
And then I was thinking for the
third book, given my profession,

169
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:42,300
it made sense to think a little younger
because I honestly think the greatest

170
00:10:42,301 --> 00:10:46,470
exercise you can do when you're stuck
or in a Rut in your life is to remember

171
00:10:46,471 --> 00:10:48,060
what your favorite children's book was.

172
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:52,920
A book that you read over and over
and over again and never got tired of.

173
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:57,090
Because somewhere in that book is a
clue to not only what makes you tick,

174
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:00,960
but also to your life's purpose.
My book was Peter Pan,

175
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,980
which featured a title character who
is at once charming and also a complete

176
00:11:04,981 --> 00:11:07,050
narcissistic pathological demon.

177
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:11,190
And I think it was at ambiguous space
between good and evil that I sparked to as

178
00:11:11,191 --> 00:11:15,030
a kid. And I'm now exploring
for a living as an adult.

179
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:20,610
What purchase of $100 or less has most
positively impacted your life in the last

180
00:11:20,611 --> 00:11:25,050
six months or in recent
memory? Oh, this is easy.

181
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:29,670
It's called mother dirt.
It clears your skin and it costs $49.

182
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:35,630
My skin was a hot mess for most of my
adolescence and into my twenties and when

183
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,530
skin problems fall you into adulthood,

184
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:42,560
it's so frustrating because it becomes
completely demoralizing and it psychs you

185
00:11:43,201 --> 00:11:46,860
out and it wreaks havoc on your
self esteem. And in my case,

186
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,540
I tried to fix them with willpower,

187
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,440
which meant that I tried every single
product on earth and I tried to

188
00:11:51,441 --> 00:11:55,030
antibiotics, which kill your
stomach. I tried harsh cleansers,

189
00:11:55,031 --> 00:11:58,600
which dry out your skin and really
make everything so much worse.

190
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:02,110
And then I was trying every three step
cleansing program, this side of Sephora,

191
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,660
which just that my skin even
more inflamed and wrung out.

192
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:10,030
But then four years ago, I discovered
mother dirt in a New York Times profile.

193
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:13,360
Back then,
I think it was known as a plus biome.

194
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,430
And their theory was super simple.

195
00:12:15,431 --> 00:12:20,431
It was that skin naturally needs a o B
a which is short for ammonia oxidizing

196
00:12:20,891 --> 00:12:25,150
bacteria in order to stay healthy
and clear. But soaps, creams,

197
00:12:25,151 --> 00:12:29,200
and all the things we use to help our
skin end up killing all that natural

198
00:12:29,201 --> 00:12:33,300
bacteria. So if you stop using those
products and restore that bacteria,

199
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,810
naturally, then all of a sudden your skin
goes back to its normal healthy state.

200
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:43,180
So my brain instantly connected with
this. I was like, yes, this makes sense.

201
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,830
I want to try this.

202
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:48,820
So I wrote them begging them to become
one of their Beta testers. And um,

203
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:52,330
luckily they agreed and mother
dirt came in a little spray bottle,

204
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,120
which I kept in my fridge.
And within a week of using it,

205
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,360
my skin was really completely clear
and I've been using it for four years,

206
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:01,720
every single day.

207
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:05,140
The trick to making it work though is not
to use other products that'll kill the

208
00:13:05,141 --> 00:13:07,390
bacteria while you're using mother dirt.

209
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:11,770
Mother dirt literally becomes your
routine. So I threw out all my fantasies.

210
00:13:11,771 --> 00:13:14,620
It's Zapping pore,
unclogging oil and shining micro dorming.

211
00:13:14,621 --> 00:13:17,890
We promise this will make you look like
Natalie Portman creams and toners and

212
00:13:17,891 --> 00:13:21,190
cleansers, all of it. And it
was really the best day ever.

213
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,730
And all I do now is spray my face
twice a day with mother dirt.

214
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,570
I don't use anything
else. It's that easy. Uh,

215
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,290
their website is mother dirt.com and I
have tons of experience with this product

216
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,160
so your listeners should feel free to
shoot me questions if they have any of

217
00:13:36,161 --> 00:13:39,160
them, uh, if they want to try
it or if they're using it.

218
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:44,080
How has a failure or apparent
failure set you up for later success?

219
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,780
Do you have any favorite failure of yours?

220
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:51,940
Oh, this story. Hearts to tell. I
don't know if I've ever told it.

221
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:58,200
The biggest failure I ever had was with
my thesis film at Columbia's Graduate

222
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,380
Film School and movie.

223
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:04,381
I poured all my savings into at that point
about $25,000 and worked on for eight

224
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:09,040
months and a day before my
final showing to the faculty,

225
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:12,610
I suddenly got a really bad
case of cold feet. And um,

226
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,990
there was a reason for this,

227
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:18,490
which goes back to what I said earlier
about Ivy Leaguers and fragile egos.

228
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:21,610
Columbia film school had this
diabolical little system,

229
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:26,140
which I don't even know if they still
have today, but after the first year,

230
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:29,590
the faculty all got together and
gave out this one big cash prize.

231
00:14:29,591 --> 00:14:34,591
I think it was $16,000 to whoever they
thought was the most promising director.

232
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:37,690
I ended up getting that prize,

233
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:42,010
which ended up being a lot more of a
curse than anything since it directly led

234
00:14:42,011 --> 00:14:44,920
to the failure that happened next.
So with my thesis film,

235
00:14:44,921 --> 00:14:48,520
I wanted to prove so badly
that I deserve that price,

236
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,970
that I was the most promising director
that put their faith in the right

237
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:57,740
student. So the night before
my jury showing, you know,

238
00:14:57,741 --> 00:15:01,640
instead of being content with all
the work I put into that film,

239
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,750
I completely panicked and decided I
should show it to one of the professors on

240
00:15:05,751 --> 00:15:09,680
the jury hoping that he'd
reassure me he didn't.

241
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,650
He thought it was slow and quote,
feckless.

242
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:17,680
That word still stings anytime I hear it
or read it and recommended I slash the

243
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,690
whole movie to pieces and
make it half the length.

244
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:25,310
Instead of looking for a second opinion
or balancing his feedback against my own

245
00:15:25,311 --> 00:15:29,180
thoughts of my work. I panicked.
Like I was a headless rooster.

246
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:32,180
This professor was obviously on the
jury and I wanted to stay the faculty's

247
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:36,260
blesseds son. And so I trusted external
validation at this point in my life,

248
00:15:36,261 --> 00:15:40,790
more than my own creative compass. So
like a lemming. I followed his advice.

249
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:44,330
I spent the whole night and doing eight
months of work and re cutting the film.

250
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,820
And the next day I presented at,
uh,

251
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:51,850
this hacked up Frankenstein to the
faculty who absolutely demolished it.

252
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:55,130
They literally thought it was
the worst movie in our class.

253
00:15:55,131 --> 00:15:58,740
Probably one of the worst movies they'd
seen. Um, you know, come into the,

254
00:15:58,741 --> 00:16:00,110
the thesis presentations.

255
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,340
Our credibility I'd earned over the
past three years went up in smoke.

256
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:08,210
I wasn't invited to participate in
the public film school for Festival.

257
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,290
Lots of gossip about how I never should
have gotten that scholarship floated

258
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:16,220
around how I had no talent,
how I'd let the prize get to my head.

259
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,670
And of course it did,
just not in the way that they all thought.

260
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:23,300
A few weeks later I ran into one of
those disappointed faculty members,

261
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:27,110
one who'd been a huge supporter of my
work before this and now could barely look

262
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:27,944
at me.

263
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,250
I told them the story of the last minute
cutting I'd done the night before my

264
00:16:31,251 --> 00:16:35,000
presentation and he asked me if
he could see the original version.

265
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,970
So I showed it to him and I
just remember the way his,

266
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,050
his eyes kind of lit up
like stars and he said, ah,

267
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,550
there you are. Now I
see you. Incidentally,

268
00:16:46,551 --> 00:16:51,290
that short film in its original version
went on to great success and it started

269
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:55,170
my whole career. But here's
the lesson that I, you know,

270
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:58,550
remind myself of constantly and
I hope you can take away from it,

271
00:16:58,551 --> 00:17:03,230
which is that don't let someone knock
you off your course after you've put in

272
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:05,750
all the work.
You have to trust the work you've done.

273
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,370
You have to always trust the work.

274
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:11,630
If you could have a gigantic billboard
anywhere with anything on it,

275
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,310
what would it say and why?

276
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:15,700
If I was in Hollywood,

277
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:20,730
the billboard would say their line and
actually have to remind this to myself

278
00:17:21,581 --> 00:17:22,360
all the time.

279
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:26,050
Every time I'm on a call with a Hollywood
producer or a studio studio executive,

280
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:29,620
I actually pull up a screen
saver with those two words.

281
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:34,360
They're lying in all caps and I watch it
sort of spread across the screen during

282
00:17:34,361 --> 00:17:35,590
the call over and over,

283
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:40,450
and it makes the whole experience a lot
more productive and less frustrating.

284
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,300
This reminds me of my first
experience in Hollywood.

285
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:44,860
I was coming out of film school.

286
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:48,670
I had written a script that a lot of
producers and studios were interested in

287
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,500
and at my first ever studio meeting,
the exact sweeps into the room.

288
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:56,160
[inaudible] it's the best grip that
he's ever read. And he's like, kid,

289
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:59,340
we are making this movie.
And he slams his fist on the table.

290
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:04,920
After that meeting, I never heard
from him again. And uh, yeah,

291
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:07,050
obviously he didn't make the movie.

292
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:12,210
But I think it's a depressing
billboard to focus on Hollywood's lies.

293
00:18:12,211 --> 00:18:15,870
So let's pick another one
if I'm anywhere but la,

294
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:19,290
the billboard would say
if you can conceive of it,

295
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:24,620
it's probably wrong and use a meditation
taught me that most of the ideas and

296
00:18:25,261 --> 00:18:28,380
opinions and rules and fix
systems I have in my mind,

297
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:31,170
those aren't the real truth there.

298
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,790
The residues of past experience that
I haven't found a way to let go of

299
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:40,610
and to be open to life, to be truly
ourselves. It's our job to be aware,

300
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:44,990
only aware, not to clutter that
precious awareness with judgements.

301
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:50,200
So I need meditation as my primary weapon
to survive life to let me study my own

302
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:52,010
brain like,

303
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:56,540
like a detective looking for thoughts or
thought patterns that I can let go of.

304
00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:01,580
Because the secret to happiness I've
learned isn't really happiness at all.

305
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:04,830
But cultivating silence
and say to me this,

306
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:09,831
this big blank beautiful space and the
only way I know how to make more blank

307
00:19:09,921 --> 00:19:14,150
space is through meditation.
So 20 minutes a day, every day,

308
00:19:14,151 --> 00:19:19,040
wherever I am. Often I use the headspace
app because it logs your progress. So,

309
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:22,040
um, it gives you a little bit of an
incentive to keep a streak going,

310
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,210
but all you need is a comfortable chair
and silence and meditation becomes the

311
00:19:26,211 --> 00:19:27,530
portal to the rest of my day.

312
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:32,860
What is one of the best or most worthwhile
investments you've ever made? Oh,

313
00:19:32,861 --> 00:19:34,960
it's definitely flying trapeze lessons.

314
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:38,650
Those are like shock therapy for the
soul because as soon as you get on the

315
00:19:38,651 --> 00:19:41,320
platform for your first class,
it's 50 feet high.

316
00:19:41,321 --> 00:19:44,470
And so you're instantly making all these
cerebral calculations. You're like,

317
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,040
I'm going to jump this way and then I'm
going to do this and then my legs are

318
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:50,920
going to go over the bar here and
I'm going to drop into the net there.

319
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:54,910
And it's all complete and utter bs
because once you jump off the platform,

320
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,790
you realize in an instant
that you have two choices.

321
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:00,460
Either you trust your body or you die.

322
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:03,640
And for someone who makes
a living with my head,

323
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:08,090
I need that kind of primal therapy
to reintegrate with my body in a,

324
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:12,080
in a very sort of forceful violent way.
And just one class,

325
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,320
we'd be realized that
underneath my mind's chatter,

326
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:18,490
my body actually has everything under
control. If I'm willing to just, you know,

327
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:22,960
take the plunge and fly.
This reminds me of a related story,

328
00:20:22,961 --> 00:20:27,961
which is that I'm a compulsive crossfitter
and at first my favorite skill when I

329
00:20:28,091 --> 00:20:30,070
started the classes was box jumps.

330
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:35,140
It felt so controllable that if you just
jump on a box of a certain height and

331
00:20:35,141 --> 00:20:39,290
you clear it, you get to build the box
higher and try it again. It was linear,

332
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:43,510
it was Pavlovian and rewards of control
freak like me in the clearest possible

333
00:20:43,511 --> 00:20:46,810
way. But at some point I hit a
plateau and I couldn't jump any.

334
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:49,810
I got frustrated,
I tried to will myself higher.

335
00:20:49,811 --> 00:20:52,810
I was watching youtube videos all day
trying to find out like what I was doing

336
00:20:52,811 --> 00:20:56,170
wrong and it just led to me
forcing it again, again and again.

337
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:00,610
And compromising my form and wiping
out a lot. Yeah. And you know,

338
00:21:00,611 --> 00:21:03,430
no matter how much I grit my
teeth and did it again and again,

339
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:08,620
I couldn't get past my max of 42 inches.
So I finally said, that's my Max.

340
00:21:08,621 --> 00:21:12,640
I told my trainer, uh, Dave,
I said, 42 inches. That's it.

341
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:16,630
That's my complete Max. And
he disagreed. He's like,

342
00:21:16,631 --> 00:21:20,530
you've gotten to this height by jumping.
Anyone can jump,

343
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,910
you can control a jump,

344
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:25,630
but the only way you're going
to get any higher is by flying.

345
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,030
And you can't think
your way through flight.

346
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:32,470
So I had to relearn box jumping
to get past my imposed Max,

347
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,920
my cerebral Max,
and find my real maximum.

348
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:41,050
And this required the same trust in
my body as a trapeze. Did jump commit,

349
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:44,650
let the body do the work. And if there's
one thing you can take from this,

350
00:21:44,651 --> 00:21:48,460
it's that you can find something in your
own life that forces you to have this

351
00:21:48,461 --> 00:21:50,500
experience. Jump, commit,

352
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:54,640
let the body do the work for there's
trapeze lessons or an Improv class or just

353
00:21:54,641 --> 00:21:58,420
freestyle dancing in your room to Rihanna.
Let your body show you.

354
00:21:58,421 --> 00:22:01,330
It's natural intelligence.
Give it the chance to show you.

355
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,720
It's going to be the most intimate
experience you'll ever have with yourself.

356
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:09,530
What is an unusual habit or
an absurd thing that you love?

357
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:14,360
I feel like this is a guilty pleasures
question and I have so many of those.

358
00:22:14,361 --> 00:22:18,500
Everything from Celine Dion to peanut
butter slather popcorn to the movie

359
00:22:18,501 --> 00:22:21,650
showgirls. So that horrible TV show, Alf.

360
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:26,200
But here's one, I guess that's
more important to me, which is an,

361
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:30,560
it's not something I confess to regularly,
but every night before I go to bed,

362
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:33,770
I pull out old issues of
Archie comics and read them.

363
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:35,630
It's not a new habit.

364
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:39,260
I used to read Archie as a kid
before I went to bed back then also.

365
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:44,630
And it's because Riverdale's and the
comic always seems so crisp and bright and

366
00:22:44,631 --> 00:22:48,560
welcoming. Riverdale was a complete
opposite of the kind of school I went to,

367
00:22:48,561 --> 00:22:53,561
which always felt so dark and morose
and always made me feel scared somehow

368
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:59,360
before having to go there
on, um, Monday mornings.

369
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:04,510
And so just reading the Archie
comics gave me this suit,

370
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:08,690
little soothing, warm feeling,
um, before I drifted off to sleep.

371
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:11,450
Then I still get to this
very day when I read them,

372
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:15,830
but maybe more importantly closing the
day by reading the same thing I did when

373
00:23:15,831 --> 00:23:20,510
I was younger, gives my life this
sense of perfect order somehow.

374
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:23,120
Maybe there's a deeper
lesson in this also,

375
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:26,180
I know I'm technically a writer
of young adult literature,

376
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:30,320
but I never think of my audience that way
or I never think of myself as a writer

377
00:23:30,321 --> 00:23:34,910
for kids because I think the things
we'd love when we're young are still the

378
00:23:34,911 --> 00:23:36,980
things we love when we're older,

379
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:42,220
we just forget or we give up or we
quote grow up and that's why the old

380
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:47,750
fairytales always held so much for
me because they worked for everyone,

381
00:23:47,751 --> 00:23:49,640
young or old.
It didn't matter who you were.

382
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:54,080
Just like Archie works for me on our old
and so maybe we all grow up in body one

383
00:23:54,081 --> 00:23:54,680
day,

384
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:59,680
but I'm not sure our soul ever does and
that's why the best stories somehow can

385
00:24:00,681 --> 00:24:05,681
touch us all and transcend things like
age or nationality or culture or anything

386
00:24:06,681 --> 00:24:08,990
like that.
That's why the best stories are universal.

387
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:12,010
In the last five years,
what new belief,

388
00:24:12,011 --> 00:24:14,590
behavior or habit has
most improved your life?

389
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:18,260
I know I should offer
something deeply profound here,

390
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:23,240
but honestly the thing that's most
improved my life in the last year is

391
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:25,850
unfollowing hot people on Instagram.

392
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,040
There's this amazing short story by
Ted Chiang that started all this called

393
00:24:31,041 --> 00:24:34,960
liking what you see that did a real
number on me. The story of sorts,

394
00:24:34,961 --> 00:24:37,280
that beauty has become this kind of alien,

395
00:24:37,281 --> 00:24:41,240
modern day super drug that with filtered
and face doing social media and we

396
00:24:41,241 --> 00:24:44,180
touched models on ads and
porn so easily accessible.

397
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,440
We've completely overloaded the centers
and overstimulated ourselves so that our

398
00:24:48,441 --> 00:24:52,700
natural instincts can no longer recognize
or react to real beauty anymore and

399
00:24:52,701 --> 00:24:56,360
that's making us confused and miserable
both in how we judge ourselves.

400
00:24:56,630 --> 00:25:01,630
And also how we judge others and that
crystal clear warning that beauty is

401
00:25:02,271 --> 00:25:03,710
literally ruining our lives.

402
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:08,030
Like the worst drug woke me up
because if we're not careful,

403
00:25:08,031 --> 00:25:11,270
and this is where I fell into this
trap and was completely guilty of it,

404
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,140
our social media feeds become filled with
people we follow only because they're

405
00:25:15,141 --> 00:25:18,920
beautiful or because we're envious of
their lives and without really realizing

406
00:25:18,921 --> 00:25:23,180
it, your feed turns into this
torture device and assault
of beauty and perfection

407
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,430
designed to make you feel inadequate.

408
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:29,150
And so opening up Instagram doesn't
inspire, inspire you anymore.

409
00:25:29,151 --> 00:25:33,440
It just makes you start to hate live
your own life since you can't possibly

410
00:25:33,441 --> 00:25:37,610
measure up to the gods and goddesses of
all these perfectly filtered pictures

411
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:41,450
and it makes you intolerant of
other people's real imperfections.

412
00:25:41,451 --> 00:25:45,920
And then it makes you start to despise
the weight of real people and real life

413
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:49,430
and invest in shallow, flimsy,
kind of two d mirrors of it.

414
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:52,280
It makes you constantly judge
your own life against others.

415
00:25:52,281 --> 00:25:55,100
It makes you fragment and
your own consciousness
because you're living outside

416
00:25:55,101 --> 00:25:57,530
of your own life in order to
get the perfect picture of it.

417
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,380
It's completely and utterly deadly.

418
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:05,900
And so I would say you have to use
social media to make yourself better,

419
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,740
to make yourself feel better,
not to punish yourself.

420
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:15,190
And that honestly has been the most
valuable change in my life in the last

421
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,390
couple of years.

422
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:20,110
What advice would you give to a smart
driven college student about to enter the

423
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:21,690
real world?
Hmm.

424
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:23,860
Let's start with the advice that I'd give,

425
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:27,370
which is make sure you have something
every day that you're looking forward to.

426
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,320
Hopefully it's your job,
but if it's not,

427
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:32,110
which isn't completely universal
and understandable condition,

428
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:35,890
maybe it's a basketball game after work
or a voice lesson or your writing group

429
00:26:35,891 --> 00:26:38,560
or an open Mike night,
maybe it's a date.

430
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:43,170
Have something every day that lights you
up because it'll keep your so hungry to

431
00:26:43,171 --> 00:26:47,400
create more of these moments instead of
getting dragged down and to kind of the

432
00:26:47,401 --> 00:26:50,910
Rut of having you know,
a job that you're not excited about.

433
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:54,570
And I'll also remind you what
really fulfills you in life.

434
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,200
When I was a pharmaceutical consultant
and I was completely miserable,

435
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:01,830
I used to come home from work and work
on my novel that would eventually become

436
00:27:01,831 --> 00:27:04,890
the score for good and evil.
I never intended to publish it.

437
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,660
I never intended anyone to read it.

438
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:10,140
I just did it to offset the
misery of a job that I hated.

439
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,710
And over time I loved
writing the book so much.

440
00:27:13,711 --> 00:27:18,711
So they used to leave early sometimes in
order to work on it and slowly the work

441
00:27:19,051 --> 00:27:23,010
started to, to, you know, the, the novel
starts to take over my work life too.

442
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:26,610
I found myself secretly working
on it, you know, in the mornings,

443
00:27:26,611 --> 00:27:29,820
during meetings in the corner,
during office, during lunch.

444
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:33,090
And eventually I got fired because they
figured out I wasn't doing any of the

445
00:27:33,091 --> 00:27:38,091
real work and I was actually working on
my book and the truth was I wasn't upset

446
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:42,000
because I had discovered what
had made me happy at that point,

447
00:27:42,001 --> 00:27:45,630
which was telling stories and nothing
was going to put that genie back in the

448
00:27:45,631 --> 00:27:46,464
bottle.

449
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:51,480
US for advice that ignore a little part
of me dies every time someone tells me

450
00:27:51,481 --> 00:27:55,620
that they've taken a job as a stepping
stone to something else when they clearly

451
00:27:55,621 --> 00:27:57,840
have no interest in that job whatsoever.

452
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:01,560
And I think it's because the truth
is you only have one life to live.

453
00:28:01,561 --> 00:28:02,580
Time is super valuable.

454
00:28:02,581 --> 00:28:05,640
It's the one currency that we're
all fighting to get more of.

455
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,330
And so if you're using the idea of
stepping stones and jobs that you're not

456
00:28:09,331 --> 00:28:11,250
really interested in
to get somewhere else,

457
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:15,540
you'll probably relying on somebody
else's path or definitions of success that

458
00:28:15,541 --> 00:28:19,080
was created in the past and I think
it's more important to live in your own

459
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,270
present and try to make your own path.

460
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,000
It's going to end up being more
fulfilling for your own life.

461
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:28,580
What are bad recommendations that you
hear in your profession or area of

462
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:29,414
expertise?

463
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,550
Too often aspiring artists put
this pressure on themselves
to make the creative

464
00:28:34,551 --> 00:28:38,150
work their only source of income that
they can't be an artist unless they're a

465
00:28:38,151 --> 00:28:38,990
full time artist.

466
00:28:38,991 --> 00:28:43,991
Somehow and in my experience it's just a
road to complete another misery because

467
00:28:44,061 --> 00:28:48,080
of art is your only source of income.
Then there's unrelenting pressure on that.

468
00:28:48,081 --> 00:28:52,130
Art and mercenary pressure isn't just the
enemy of the creative elves inside you

469
00:28:52,131 --> 00:28:53,510
trying to get the work done.

470
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:57,830
But mercenary pressure also often
leads to really bad and rushed work.

471
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:03,260
So having another stream of income dreams,
the pressure on your creative engine,

472
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:07,670
if nothing comes of your art or
it flops and miserably, whatever,

473
00:29:07,671 --> 00:29:11,480
you still have an iron clad plan to
support yourself and so you quit of soul,

474
00:29:11,481 --> 00:29:14,510
feels a lot lighter.
It feels free to do its best work.

475
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,010
And I'm still a personal practitioner
of this, even though I could easily be,

476
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:22,160
you know, full time writer because
after four books in a movie deal,

477
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:26,300
I want a separate side stream of income
in order to be able to write without

478
00:29:26,301 --> 00:29:30,110
feeling like it's a matter of life and
death. So I tutor kids on the side.

479
00:29:30,111 --> 00:29:34,160
I help them with their
college applications and
I've been doing that for the

480
00:29:34,161 --> 00:29:39,140
last 10 years and really no plans to
stop because it makes the books better in

481
00:29:39,141 --> 00:29:41,800
the end if I don't feel like,
um,

482
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,350
the books are my only source of livelihood

483
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:49,420
in the last five years, what have
you become better at saying no to?

484
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:54,060
I am convinced that the reason Hollywood
movies are often so terrible is because

485
00:29:54,061 --> 00:29:57,210
everyone is so busy hedging their bets
that they're working on a thousand

486
00:29:57,211 --> 00:29:57,991
projects at once.

487
00:29:57,991 --> 00:30:00,570
They don't want to commit to anything
for fear that it's going to fail.

488
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,570
No one is giving anything
their full focus.

489
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:06,720
So when I worked on the
school for good and evil,

490
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,700
I decided to take the opposite track.

491
00:30:08,701 --> 00:30:13,701
I decided to commit completely and
the series has taught me to be patient

492
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:15,870
because when I'm writing a new book,

493
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:19,170
that's all I work on and I say no
to all other creative projects,

494
00:30:19,171 --> 00:30:23,760
no matter how lucrative do I
miss opportunities. Absolutely.

495
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,560
But it means that when
the books hit the shelves,

496
00:30:25,561 --> 00:30:29,220
I know that I've left everything on the
page and they're the absolute best I

497
00:30:29,221 --> 00:30:30,054
could have done,

498
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:33,630
which then gives a series the greatest
chance to survive through time.

499
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,760
It's easier to say no though.

500
00:30:35,761 --> 00:30:39,370
When professionally I know what my
driving need is because if you're driving

501
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:41,520
this to build income and
provide for your family,

502
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:45,090
then you'll say no to anything
that doesn't further that goal,

503
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:47,760
but if you're driving, you need to
stop your own business for example,

504
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:51,720
then you need to be a bit more promiscuous
and trying out ideas until the right

505
00:30:51,721 --> 00:30:55,140
one hits. In my case, my driving
need is always unequivocal,

506
00:30:55,141 --> 00:30:59,460
which is I want to make something that
lasts and that means committing to my

507
00:30:59,461 --> 00:31:00,001
current work,

508
00:31:00,001 --> 00:31:03,360
like a marriage and believing that if
I give these six books in the series,

509
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:07,890
everything I have then
better opportunities will
eventually rise to replace the

510
00:31:07,891 --> 00:31:09,150
ones that I passed up.

511
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:13,420
When you feel overwhelmed or unfocused,
what do you do?

512
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,200
So feeling overwhelmed usually
means one of two things.

513
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:22,670
Either my blood's trapped in my head
and I need to get out there and exercise

514
00:31:22,671 --> 00:31:25,130
and move the blood around and you know,

515
00:31:25,131 --> 00:31:30,131
give myself space to breathe or more
likely my to do list as become completely

516
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,290
overpacked and my brain.
No,

517
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:37,550
there's no way I can reasonably get done
everything I've set out to do and so

518
00:31:37,551 --> 00:31:41,210
that's when the solution is taking out
the calendar and start canceling things,

519
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:43,460
moving things around,
you know,

520
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:48,490
seeing what I can take off my plate and
then I can feel the promises of operate.

521
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:53,180
Once I hit that threshold of knowing that
I can reasonably accomplish whatever I

522
00:31:53,181 --> 00:31:53,751
want to do.

523
00:31:53,751 --> 00:31:58,751
Now feeling unfocused is all different
because it usually means I haven't quite

524
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:03,530
locked into whatever I'm working on that
a part of me still thinks I can pull

525
00:32:03,531 --> 00:32:05,720
the ripcord and bail
and is afraid to commit.

526
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:09,740
It usually happens in the first three
months of writing a new book because that

527
00:32:09,741 --> 00:32:12,560
lack of focus is usually just fear.

528
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:16,580
Fear that the new book is terrible fear
that is going to fail miserably and sync

529
00:32:16,581 --> 00:32:21,140
my career early on. I used to give
into that fear and four books later.

530
00:32:21,141 --> 00:32:23,240
Now I know that I just
have to hold on tight,

531
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:26,180
grip my teeth and blow right
through it like a ghost.

532
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:33,790
Our guest today is Susan Cain.
See a I n on Twitter at Susan Cain,

533
00:32:33,791 --> 00:32:38,230
Facebook author Susan Cain,
quiet rev.com is her website.

534
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:42,440
Susan is the cofounder of quiet revolution
and the author of the best sellers,

535
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:43,970
quiet power,
subtitle,

536
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,900
the secret strengths of introverted
kids and quiet subtitle,

537
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,840
the power of introverts in a
world that can't stop talking,

538
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,590
which has been translated
into 40 languages and has
been on the New York Times

539
00:32:54,591 --> 00:32:57,800
bestseller list for more than four years.
Straight.

540
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:01,130
Quiet was named the best book of
the year by Fast Company magazine,

541
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:04,970
which also named Susan, one of its
most creative people in business.

542
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:09,830
Susan is the cofounder of the quiet
schools network and the quiet leadership

543
00:33:09,831 --> 00:33:13,250
institute and her writing has appeared
in the New York Times, the Atlantic,

544
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:15,320
The Wall Street Journal,
and other publications.

545
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:18,620
Her Ted talk has been viewed
more than 17 million times,

546
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:20,300
probably more than 20
million at this point.

547
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:23,900
And it was named by Bill Gates as
one of his all time favorite talks.

548
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:31,880
How has a failure or apparent
failure set you up for later success?

549
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,580
Do you have any favorite failure of yours?

550
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:40,330
So a very long time ago I used to be
a corporate lawyer and I was a very

551
00:33:40,671 --> 00:33:44,030
ambivalent corporate lawyer and anyone
could have told you that it was in the

552
00:33:44,031 --> 00:33:48,740
wrong profession, but still I had
dedicated tens of time to it. Um,

553
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:52,340
you know, three years of law school when
you're clerking for a federal judge,

554
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:54,710
six and a half years at
a Wall Street law firm.

555
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:58,730
And I had a lot of very deep
relationships with fellow attorneys,

556
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:04,120
but the day came when I was very well
along on partnership track that the senior

557
00:34:04,881 --> 00:34:09,650
partner in my firm came to my office and
sat down and told me that I would not

558
00:34:09,651 --> 00:34:13,550
be put up her partner on schedule.
And to this day,

559
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:17,840
I really don't know whether he meant that
I would never be put up for partner or

560
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,460
just delayed for a long time,

561
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:24,940
but all I know is that I burst into tears
right in front of him and then asked

562
00:34:25,791 --> 00:34:29,780
for a leave of absence.
And I left work that day.

563
00:34:29,781 --> 00:34:34,781
And I remember bicycling around and
around Central Park in New York City,

564
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,100
having no idea what I
was going to do next.

565
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:42,700
I thought I'd probably travel and I had
all kinds of plans to go to India and so

566
00:34:42,951 --> 00:34:45,720
on. But instead, and,

567
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:50,570
and this all happened in such a kind of
Seddon and cinematic way that it will

568
00:34:50,571 --> 00:34:51,620
defy belief.
But

569
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:56,300
what happened is I remembered that
I had always wanted to be a writer,

570
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:57,560
which seems strange.
You would think.

571
00:34:57,561 --> 00:35:00,160
I had always had that in the
back of my mind. But, um,

572
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:05,330
my writing dreams where something I forgot
about had forgotten about for a very

573
00:35:05,331 --> 00:35:09,020
long time. Um, but I started
writing that very night.

574
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,430
And then the next day I signed up for
a class at Nyu and creative nonfiction

575
00:35:13,431 --> 00:35:14,264
writing.

576
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:19,160
And the next week I went to the very
first session of that class and it really

577
00:35:19,161 --> 00:35:22,730
was like a kind of epiphany moment.
I felt like I was finally home.

578
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:28,160
I had no expectation of ever making a
living through writing because you always

579
00:35:28,161 --> 00:35:29,720
hear about how difficult that is,

580
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:33,560
but I was just clear to me that from
then on I was going to put writing at my

581
00:35:33,561 --> 00:35:38,070
center and so I decided to just look for
freelance work that would give me lots

582
00:35:38,071 --> 00:35:41,910
of free time to to feed my hobby.
Now,

583
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:45,840
if I had succeeded at
making partner on schedule,

584
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,940
I might still be there today.
You know,

585
00:35:47,941 --> 00:35:52,470
kind of miserably negotiating
corporate transaction 16 hours a day.

586
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:58,140
It's not that I had never thought about
what else I might want to do other than

587
00:35:58,141 --> 00:35:58,740
law,

588
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:03,240
but there's something about being
inside of very intense 16 hour a day.

589
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:04,770
Her medic culture,

590
00:36:04,771 --> 00:36:09,771
like a lot of practice that makes it
really difficult to figure out what else

591
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:10,734
you might want to do.

592
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:15,030
What is one of the best or most
worthwhile investments you've ever made?

593
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:20,400
Best Investment I ever made was the seven
years of time that it took me to write

594
00:36:20,401 --> 00:36:21,234
quiet.

595
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:25,950
I really didn't care how long it took
and though I very much wanted the book to

596
00:36:25,951 --> 00:36:30,510
succeed, I felt good about that investment
of time regardless of the outcome.

597
00:36:30,511 --> 00:36:32,490
Cause I really didn't know
what was gonna happen,

598
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:37,410
but I felt so certain that writing in
general and that writing that book in

599
00:36:37,411 --> 00:36:42,330
particular was the right thing to do.
So what happened is, well first of all,

600
00:36:42,331 --> 00:36:45,930
I had two kids along the way. So
of course that slowed me down. Um,

601
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:50,960
but also I handed in a first draft
after the first two years and my editor

602
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:55,890
basically said this is very crappy.
And she said,

603
00:36:55,891 --> 00:37:00,180
take all the time you need and start from
scratch and go home and get it right.

604
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,290
And you might think that that was
a moment of grand discouragement,

605
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,120
but it was actually exactly the opposite.

606
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:11,330
I remember leaving her office elated
because I agreed with her and I knew I

607
00:37:12,961 --> 00:37:15,600
needed a lot of time to get it right.
Um,

608
00:37:15,601 --> 00:37:18,060
and I was thrilled at the publisher
was giving it to me. You know,

609
00:37:18,061 --> 00:37:21,870
I had never published a word before quiet
and I felt like I was learning how to

610
00:37:21,871 --> 00:37:23,490
write a book from,
from scratch.

611
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:28,520
And most publishing houses rush books
to market a long time before they're

612
00:37:28,831 --> 00:37:33,240
really fully done, you know, just
because of economic exigencies and, and,

613
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:36,690
and I feel like if she had done that,
there would be no quiet revolution.

614
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:42,070
What is an unusual habit or
an absurd thing that you love?

615
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:47,930
I really love sad,
minor key music.

616
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:52,940
And the funny thing is I find that kind
of music very elevating and transcendent

617
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:54,860
and not actually sad at all.

618
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:59,810
And I think it's because there's kind of
music is really about the fragility and

619
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,090
the preciousness of life and love.

620
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:06,920
So if you're curious about
some examples for me,

621
00:38:06,921 --> 00:38:09,470
Leonard Cohen is my patron saint.
Ah,

622
00:38:09,471 --> 00:38:13,700
you could try listening to dance me
to the end of love or to famous blue

623
00:38:13,701 --> 00:38:17,630
raincoat or pretty much to anything
that he's ever written. Um,

624
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:22,010
if you're not familiar with his work,
I'm sure you know his song. Hallelujah.

625
00:38:22,011 --> 00:38:25,820
That has been made into a
cover a gazillion times,

626
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:29,270
but that really is only
the tip of Leonard Iceberg.

627
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:34,810
I also love this song
called [inaudible] by um,

628
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:37,090
an amazing guy named Eden Rice.
Hell,

629
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:42,810
it's a really gorgeous song of
a man longing for his beloved.

630
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:45,400
And it's really about longing in general,

631
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:48,160
whether you're longing for
God or for heaven or whatever.

632
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:52,630
My favorite word in any
language is the word, so dodgy,

633
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:56,980
which is the Portuguese word that's at
the heart of Brazilian and Portuguese

634
00:38:56,981 --> 00:38:57,880
culture and music.

635
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:03,120
And it basically means a kind of sweet
longing for a beloved thing or person

636
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,090
that will likely never returned to you.

637
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:11,890
And I know that sounds a long
so desperately sad, but again,

638
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,420
it's so hard to articulate it,

639
00:39:13,421 --> 00:39:18,100
but there's something so incredibly
beautiful and transcendent in that very

640
00:39:18,101 --> 00:39:22,300
idea. And if you want to hear
the music expressing that idea,

641
00:39:22,301 --> 00:39:27,301
you could try a band called modular
deus or the singers sees area,

642
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:31,150
I'm not sure I'm pronouncing her name
correctly, but sees Adria, a Vora,

643
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:34,570
something like that. And by the way, my,

644
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:39,660
then my next book or my whole kind of
nixed work chapter of my life is all about

645
00:39:39,731 --> 00:39:41,110
this topic of,

646
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:47,100
of how loss and longing are
such an essential part of
love and art and growth in

647
00:39:48,101 --> 00:39:48,934
general.

648
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:53,140
What advice would you give to a smart
driven college student about to enter the

649
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:53,974
real world,

650
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:56,900
smart driven college student?
Um,

651
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:01,290
you're going to hear so many stories of
people who risked everything in order to

652
00:40:01,291 --> 00:40:05,220
achieve this goal or that goal, especially
when it comes to creative goals.

653
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:09,750
But I don't believe that your best
creative work is done when you're stressed

654
00:40:09,751 --> 00:40:12,840
out because you're like on the edge
of bankruptcy or some other personal

655
00:40:12,841 --> 00:40:15,090
disaster.
It's really just the opposite.

656
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:20,120
So you should be setting up your life
in a way that's as comfortable and happy

657
00:40:20,461 --> 00:40:21,270
as possible.

658
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:24,960
And that often means setting it up in a
way that doesn't appear very creative on

659
00:40:24,961 --> 00:40:25,561
the outside.

660
00:40:25,561 --> 00:40:29,520
Because here you're tapping into kind
of more conservative structures, um,

661
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:33,180
but what you're really doing is freeing
yourself up to accommodate your creative

662
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:34,014
work.

663
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:38,910
So I often ask myself whether all
those years of of Wall Street law,

664
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,090
we're a waste.
Given that what I really was meant,

665
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:46,360
I think to be doing the whole time was
to explore human psychology and you know,

666
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:47,370
do what I love to do.

667
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:51,960
Now I'm writing about what
it's like to be alive.

668
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:54,460
It's really how I think of my work.
Um,

669
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:58,500
but the answer is that no,

670
00:40:58,501 --> 00:41:02,760
it was totally not a waste for so
many reasons. I mean, first of all,

671
00:41:02,761 --> 00:41:06,360
because I learned so much about the
so called real world that would have

672
00:41:06,361 --> 00:41:09,240
otherwise been a mystery to me.
And second,

673
00:41:09,241 --> 00:41:13,920
because a front row seat at a Wall Street
negotiation is as good a place as any

674
00:41:13,921 --> 00:41:17,820
to study the ridiculousness
of being human. Um,

675
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:23,270
but most of all maybe is because it
gave those years that I spent practicing

676
00:41:23,971 --> 00:41:24,341
law,

677
00:41:24,341 --> 00:41:29,341
gave me a financial cushion when I was
ready to use it to try out a creative

678
00:41:29,791 --> 00:41:34,640
life. I wasn't a huge cushion. I
had not managed to see if that much,

679
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:39,830
but it didn't make a huge difference.
So even once I started my writing life,

680
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:44,750
I spent tons of time setting
up this little freelance
business on the side where

681
00:41:44,751 --> 00:41:47,210
I taught people negotiation skills.

682
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:51,350
And it was something that I felt I could
use as long as I needed to to support

683
00:41:51,351 --> 00:41:54,920
myself when my,
my real center always was writing.

684
00:41:55,490 --> 00:41:57,570
And I like the,

685
00:41:57,571 --> 00:42:00,980
the thing I was trying to do the whole
time was take the pressure off the

686
00:42:00,981 --> 00:42:04,900
writing so that the writing
could always be a source of,

687
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:06,770
of joy and satisfaction.

688
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:10,430
So I told myself that my goal was to get
something published by the time it was

689
00:42:10,431 --> 00:42:13,790
75 years old and that was it.
Um,

690
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:17,450
so I met my goal a lot earlier than that.
Okay.

691
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:22,600
So I am not saying by the way that the
smart driven college student who wants to

692
00:42:24,171 --> 00:42:28,610
have a creative life should spend 10 years
in corporate finance first. Very much.

693
00:42:28,611 --> 00:42:33,380
Not saying that I'm really making a
more basic point that you should just be

694
00:42:33,381 --> 00:42:36,680
planning how you're going to make
ends meet and have a way to do that.

695
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:39,890
And that way, the time that you do
spend on your creative projects,

696
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,710
and it could be 30 minutes a day,
it could be 10 hours a day,

697
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:47,950
but you want those moments to be about
focus and flow and occasional glimpses of

698
00:42:49,221 --> 00:42:52,970
joy and you do not want them to be
associated with financial stress.

699
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:57,210
When you feel overwhelmed or unfocused,
what do you do?

700
00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:02,580
I Love Espresso and I would
happily consume it all day long,

701
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:08,540
but I'm really afraid of habituating
to it and losing its magic powers.

702
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:14,840
So I only allow myself to have one latte
a day and I save it for when I'm doing

703
00:43:16,201 --> 00:43:20,880
my most creative work of the day because
it really does jumpstart my mind and

704
00:43:20,881 --> 00:43:24,720
this almost magical.
It has a kind of magical power.

705
00:43:24,930 --> 00:43:29,930
And also by now I associate latte
and it kind of pub bloviate way,

706
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:35,420
um, with writing, which then
gets associated in a pub,

707
00:43:35,421 --> 00:43:39,570
Low v and way with the pleasure of coffee.
So it's all really good feedback loop.

708
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:44,680
My guest today is Graham Dunkin.

709
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:47,590
You can find out more
about him at east rock cap,

712
00:43:57,161 --> 00:44:00,310

Before starting these truck 12 years ago,

713
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:04,330
Greg worked at two other investment firms.
He started his career by cofounding,

714
00:44:04,331 --> 00:44:08,380
the Independent Wall Street research
for a medley global advisors grand.

715
00:44:08,381 --> 00:44:11,650
Graduated from Yale with a Ba in ethics,
politics and economics.

716
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:16,950
He is a member of the council on Foreign
Relations and serves as Cochair of the

717
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:19,690
Sohn Conference Foundation,
which funds pediatric cancer research.

718
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:24,220
Our mutual friend Josh Waitzkin who
introduced us and you should look up Josh

719
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:26,020
Waitzkin if you don't know who he is,
I'll give you a hint.

720
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:29,200
Searching for Bobby Fischer.
Josh Calls Graham quote,

721
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:32,670
the tip of the spear in the realms of
talent tracking in judgment of human

722
00:44:32,671 --> 00:44:36,450
potential in high stakes mental arenas
and quote, and that is a mouthful,

723
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:37,591
but Graham is,

724
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:41,940
I've gotten to know him over the years
is more and more impressive with every

725
00:44:41,941 --> 00:44:46,080
encounter that I have with them. And if
you want to hear more from Graham ideas,

726
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:47,520
his thinking frameworks,

727
00:44:47,521 --> 00:44:52,521
everything you can sign up for his monthly
email newsletter@grahamdunkin.blog.

728
00:44:56,540 --> 00:45:00,230
What is an unusual habit or
an absurd thing that you love?

729
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:01,741
So Tim,

730
00:45:01,741 --> 00:45:06,390
I wear the SUBPAC wearable physical sound
system while I commute on the subway

731
00:45:06,391 --> 00:45:09,090
to my office and sometimes I
wear it while I work at my desk.

732
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:13,140
You strap the system to your back and
chest and I'll let you feel the vibration

733
00:45:13,141 --> 00:45:17,130
of music through your whole
body. Music producers, gamers,

734
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:19,890
and deaf people are the primary users.

735
00:45:20,290 --> 00:45:24,600
And I find the full body experience of
music makes listening to music or even a

736
00:45:24,601 --> 00:45:26,130
podcast that has a lot of base,

737
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:31,290
more of an immersive somatic experience
rather than just a conceptual head

738
00:45:31,291 --> 00:45:32,124
thing.

739
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:35,680
If you could have a gigantic billboard
anywhere with anything on it,

740
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:37,360
what would it say and why?

741
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:42,350
So I have two candidates. First,
it's not how well you play the game.

742
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:46,490
It's deciding what game you want to play.
That's by Kwame Appiah,

743
00:45:46,491 --> 00:45:48,680
who's a philosophy professor at Nyu.

744
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:53,780
And I like it because it
separates striving from
strategy and reminds me to take

745
00:45:53,781 --> 00:45:55,490
a macro view of whatever I'm doing.

746
00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:58,790
Like in a video game where you can zoom
out and you suddenly see you've been

747
00:45:58,791 --> 00:46:01,610
running around in one corner of the maze.

748
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:07,460
It loosens my relationship
to the game too. It's Kinda,
it's the game of the game.

749
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:08,750
Helping to separate,

750
00:46:08,751 --> 00:46:13,430
having ambition from being ambitious
or accessing hustle without actually

751
00:46:13,431 --> 00:46:14,360
becoming a hustler.

752
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:18,200
Another quote that I really like is from
the Buddhist novelist George Saunders

753
00:46:18,201 --> 00:46:21,500
who said in an interview with the New
Yorker that he has an image of people's

754
00:46:21,501 --> 00:46:25,970
nectar indicating containers
from Buddhist like Saunders.

755
00:46:25,971 --> 00:46:29,570
Think everyone has a Buddha nature.
That good core of your being.

756
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:32,660
Some people sometimes lose lose
track of it, but it's there.

757
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:35,570
I think it's such a good
assumption to have about everyone,

758
00:46:35,571 --> 00:46:37,550
even if you're wrong
sometimes that that's there.

759
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:42,890
And I also love that image it of nectar
and decaying containers that helps me

760
00:46:43,790 --> 00:46:48,790
visualize the stream of Buddha nature
flowing through all the lovely flawed

761
00:46:49,850 --> 00:46:52,830
living and slowly dying creatures
that we all encounter every day.

762
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:56,630
And I sometimes get this glimpse
of how my three year old daughters,

763
00:46:56,750 --> 00:47:01,750
three year old self is so temporary
Buddhist like to say we're all on fire and

764
00:47:02,031 --> 00:47:05,420
it's so beautiful. Sometimes
tune in, just see the flickering.

765
00:47:07,270 --> 00:47:10,510
What are one to three books that
are greatly influenced your life?

766
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:16,960
So the psychiatrist's Sam Burundis has
a book called making sense of people.

767
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:21,400
That had a huge impact on my thinking
and I sometimes give a copy to people who

768
00:47:21,401 --> 00:47:25,600
are building a new team and doing a lot
of hiring or even a friend that might be

769
00:47:25,601 --> 00:47:29,740
deciding whether or not to get engaged.
As part of my role, an investor,

770
00:47:29,741 --> 00:47:33,880
I interview four to 500 people a year
to decide whether to hire them or invest

771
00:47:33,881 --> 00:47:37,570
in their various startups and investment
funds and most useful mental model.

772
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:39,370
I've found to help understand,

773
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:44,260
help me understand what makes people
tick is the one that Brenda's described

774
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:45,250
eloquently in his book.

775
00:47:45,610 --> 00:47:50,610
The model is called the big five or
ocean and the o stands for open minded.

776
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:54,490
The C stands for conscientious,
the e for extroverted,

777
00:47:55,030 --> 00:47:59,710
a for agreeable in for
neurotic and the academics,

778
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:03,520
academics who developed the model clumped
every English adjective that can be

779
00:48:03,521 --> 00:48:06,790
used to describe somebody's into
categories and then they reduced them to a

780
00:48:06,791 --> 00:48:08,380
small set of factors as they could.

781
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,950
So have lots of people agreed they
could call somebody both gregarious and

782
00:48:11,951 --> 00:48:12,784
outgoing.

783
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:16,990
Then they decided that was the same thing
and they kept reducing that down until

784
00:48:16,991 --> 00:48:19,450
they got,
say extroversion as a primary factor.

785
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:21,580
And in the academic
literature on personality,

786
00:48:21,581 --> 00:48:23,140
the big five is like the
equivalent of gravity.

787
00:48:23,141 --> 00:48:27,220
There've been thousands of studies and
it's considered much more statistically

788
00:48:27,221 --> 00:48:29,590
accurate than alternatives
such as Myers breaks.

789
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:33,430
And so if you want to picture it
like for a high openminded picture,

790
00:48:33,431 --> 00:48:38,431
Leonardo Divinci for high conscientious
picture Robo cop for high extroverted

791
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:40,810
picture Bill Clinton.

792
00:48:41,230 --> 00:48:45,760
And for the opposite highly introverted
picture Obama for low neuroticism

793
00:48:45,761 --> 00:48:50,760
pictured the dude from the big Lebowski
or any stereotypical Californian and for

794
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:55,770
high neuroticism picture of Woody Allen
or Kanye West or most New Yorkers I

795
00:48:56,741 --> 00:48:58,570
could free associate about the big five,

796
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:00,840
but I'll leave it there if
you want more than checkout.

797
00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:04,870
San Brenda says book and Scott Barry
Kaufman is also obsessed with the big five

798
00:49:04,871 --> 00:49:06,670
and writes a bunch of
useful stuff about it.

799
00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:11,350
There are two other mental models that
have greatly influenced my thinking about

800
00:49:11,351 --> 00:49:15,140
people and teams. The first
is Harvard professors. Uh,

801
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:17,500
Robert Keegan's model
of adult development.

802
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:22,810
Keegan argues that adults develop and
make sense of reality in five discreet

803
00:49:22,811 --> 00:49:23,644
phases.

804
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:28,120
He lays out his theory in his
1994 book in over our heads,

805
00:49:28,121 --> 00:49:30,490
which is unfortunately
not available on kindle,

806
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:34,960
but his velum paper back in the title
in over our heads is a reference to how

807
00:49:34,961 --> 00:49:38,830
the vast majority of adult Americans are
at this socialized stage of development.

808
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:43,390
We call it level three that have and they
have difficulty taking other people's

809
00:49:43,391 --> 00:49:48,310
perspectives and they tend to follow
assumptions given to them by society as

810
00:49:48,311 --> 00:49:52,660
opposed to assumptions they freely choose
and he points out like in modern life

811
00:49:52,661 --> 00:49:55,270
that many activities such
as parenting benefit,

812
00:49:55,271 --> 00:49:58,690
if you can set boundaries and not care
what your kid thinks it needs to direct

813
00:49:58,691 --> 00:50:00,010
them and doing what you
think they should do.

814
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:04,680
I feel like I sometimes
see what I imagined to be
socialized stage parents who

815
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:08,530
are afraid of, they're almost afraid
of their kid on some level they they,

816
00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:11,410
they take what their kids think too
seriously and I want to be their friends

817
00:50:11,411 --> 00:50:12,640
first and parents second.

818
00:50:13,670 --> 00:50:16,960
There is when I'm interviewing somebody
there's something that can feel a little

819
00:50:16,961 --> 00:50:20,530
bit icy when you're interacting with
self authored people cause they aren't

820
00:50:20,531 --> 00:50:23,060
sourcing their approval from you.
You can either,

821
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:28,061
there's something about the tone of the
interview that is distinctive and to try

822
00:50:28,281 --> 00:50:29,300
to make this more concrete.

823
00:50:29,301 --> 00:50:33,140
There's this amazing example in chapter
nine of in over our heads or Keegan

824
00:50:33,141 --> 00:50:37,190
describes a couple who are both operating
from my self authored mindset and it's

825
00:50:37,191 --> 00:50:40,340
a very distinctive description of the
way they make sense of each other and of

826
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,240
being married.

827
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:45,590
That totally reminds me of one of Tim's
podcast with Laird Hamilton and Gabby

828
00:50:45,590 --> 00:50:48,620
Reese where Gabby is describing the
way she relates to layered into their

829
00:50:48,621 --> 00:50:53,621
marriage in a way that to my ear is super
unusual self authored way for people

830
00:50:55,101 --> 00:50:57,170
who are interested in
learning more about the model.

831
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:01,370
I recommend Keegan's later book immunity
to change where he describes the model

832
00:51:01,371 --> 00:51:02,570
briefly at the beginning of the book,

833
00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:06,680
I'll read a quick excerpt
just so people have a feel.

834
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:12,160
Having a socialized mind dramatically
influences the sending and receiving of

835
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,220
information at work.

836
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:17,150
If this is the level of mental complexity
through which I view the world than

837
00:51:17,151 --> 00:51:20,910
what I send will be strongly influenced
by what I believe others want to hear.

838
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:24,020
Let's contrast this with
the self authoring mind.

839
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:26,810
If I view the world from this
level of mental complexity,

840
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:31,520
what I send is more likely
to be a function of what
I deem others need to hear

841
00:51:31,521 --> 00:51:34,670
to best further the agenda
or mission of my design.

842
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:39,590
Consciously or unconsciously, I have
a direction and agenda, a stance,

843
00:51:39,591 --> 00:51:42,290
a strategy and analysis of what is needed,

844
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:45,650
a prior context from which
my communication arises.

845
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:49,880
The self authoring mind creates a filter
for what it will allow to come through.

846
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:54,380
It places a priority on receiving the
information that is sought information

847
00:51:54,381 --> 00:51:57,380
that I haven't asked for it in which
is not have obvious relevance to my own

848
00:51:57,381 --> 00:52:00,980
design for action as a much tougher
time making it through my filter.

849
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:05,570
It's easy to see how all of this could
describe an admirable capacity for focus

850
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:09,620
for distinguishing the important from
the urgent for making best use of one's

851
00:52:09,621 --> 00:52:10,460
limited time,

852
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:14,150
but having a means to cut through the
unending and ever mounting claims on one's

853
00:52:14,151 --> 00:52:14,984
attention.

854
00:52:15,290 --> 00:52:18,560
The speaks to the way the self authoring
mind is in advanced over the socialized

855
00:52:18,561 --> 00:52:23,060
mind, but the same description may also
be a recipe for disaster if one's plan or

856
00:52:23,061 --> 00:52:24,470
stances flawed in some way.

857
00:52:24,471 --> 00:52:26,960
If it leaves out some crucial
element of the equation,

858
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:30,980
not appreciated by the filter or if the
world changes in such a way that a once

859
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:32,600
good frame becomes an antiquated one.

860
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:38,680
Contrast this self transforming mind
both values and is wary about any one

861
00:52:38,751 --> 00:52:40,490
stance,
analysis or agenda.

862
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:44,750
It is mindful that powerful though a
given design might be this design almost

863
00:52:44,751 --> 00:52:46,010
inevitably leave something out.

864
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:50,390
It is aware that it lives in time and
that the world is in motion and that what

865
00:52:50,391 --> 00:52:54,200
might've made sense today may not make
as much sense tomorrow. Therefore,

866
00:52:54,201 --> 00:52:57,620
when communicating people with self
transforming minds are not only advancing

867
00:52:57,621 --> 00:53:01,220
their agenda and design. There are
also inquiring about the design itself.

868
00:53:01,910 --> 00:53:06,320
Information sending is not just on behalf
of driving does also to remake the map

869
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:07,760
or reset the direction

870
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:12,740
someone wants to hear how a person's
sounds when they make sense of reality at

871
00:53:12,741 --> 00:53:14,000
the self transforming stage.

872
00:53:14,030 --> 00:53:17,930
Then I direct them to listen to
Tim's early podcasts but ed Catmull,

873
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:20,780
the Pixar founder and president,

874
00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:25,530
the loose but strong grip that
kept mall has on his own beliefs,

875
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:28,110
his fluid and flexible
relationship to time.

876
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:32,100
There's this slightly a femoral quality
and comfort with paradox that comes

877
00:53:32,101 --> 00:53:36,270
through in the interview and he in the
interview when Tim's interview with him,

878
00:53:36,271 --> 00:53:39,600
he's actually a bit of a
difficult interviewee and he
feels a little hard to pin

879
00:53:39,601 --> 00:53:40,980
down at times.
For instance,

880
00:53:40,981 --> 00:53:44,310
he refuses to answer Tim's question
about what he would tell his 20 year old

881
00:53:44,311 --> 00:53:48,180
self because he says now he has a way of
understanding that his 20 year old self

882
00:53:48,181 --> 00:53:49,440
simply couldn't understand.

883
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:53,820
This is all very consistent with a self
transforming mindset which happens later

884
00:53:53,821 --> 00:53:57,540
in life for most people if it
happens at all, it's an example.

885
00:53:57,541 --> 00:54:02,120
It would surprise me to hear Catmull
say or think any version of quote.

886
00:54:02,130 --> 00:54:06,640
I'm just trying to stay relevant as he
gets older and from one perspective you

887
00:54:06,641 --> 00:54:10,470
might be losing ground versus younger
people in this industry or he fails to get

888
00:54:10,471 --> 00:54:11,490
his phone calls return,

889
00:54:12,210 --> 00:54:15,930
but his way of making sense is likely
that he gets to define who or what is

890
00:54:15,931 --> 00:54:18,630
relevant not as peers in silicon
valley or the movie industry.

891
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:23,340
One last self-transforming example I
would give is the voice of the narrator of

892
00:54:23,341 --> 00:54:28,050
the home parable by Louise Gluck. If
you Google it, she's really amazing.

893
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:33,240
The third mental model that I
find myself recommending lately,

894
00:54:33,350 --> 00:54:38,350
not in a book but on a slightly obscure
website called work with source.com and

895
00:54:39,241 --> 00:54:43,080
it's based on a European
management consultant who
studied hundreds of startups

896
00:54:43,470 --> 00:54:45,900
and realize that even when
there are multiple cofounders,

897
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:50,520
there's actually always in every case
he found an actual single source.

898
00:54:50,970 --> 00:54:53,790
The person who took the first
risk on a new initiative,

899
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:58,170
even if that risk was only picking up
the phone and calling the other cofounder

900
00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:03,360
and he argues that that source maintains
a unique relationship with the gestalt

901
00:55:03,390 --> 00:55:07,770
because of the gestalt of the original
idea and has that person has an intuitive

902
00:55:07,771 --> 00:55:10,410
knowledge of what the right
next step for the initiative is,

903
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:14,490
whereas others who joined later to
help with the execution often lack that

904
00:55:14,491 --> 00:55:17,100
intuitive connection to the
founder's original insight.

905
00:55:18,330 --> 00:55:22,140
And these guys argue that many
organizational tensions in power struggles

906
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:26,700
actually often revolve around lack of
explicit acknowledgement of who the source

907
00:55:26,701 --> 00:55:30,170
of the initiative is.
I was talking about this with a common,

908
00:55:30,171 --> 00:55:31,410
an angel investor recently,

909
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:35,850
and he had found that consistent with
his sample of startups and he noted that

910
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:41,580
many founders seem to hire friends as
cofounders more to quell their own anxiety

911
00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:46,410
during the early highly ambiguous days
of a new company than to fulfill a

912
00:55:46,411 --> 00:55:47,310
specific role.

913
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:51,790
This can work fine as long as everyone
is clear on who the sources their spa.

914
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:53,610
And it's a little paradoxical,

915
00:55:53,611 --> 00:55:57,510
here's the responsibility to fully own
the role of source rests in large part

916
00:55:57,511 --> 00:55:58,620
with a source of themselves.

917
00:55:59,970 --> 00:56:04,970
Handing off the source role of an
issue to another person is possible but

918
00:56:05,281 --> 00:56:07,710
extremely difficult and
it's often mishandled.

919
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:12,480
And these guys know that a key to a
successful transition is for the original

920
00:56:12,481 --> 00:56:17,481
source to actually move on and allow
the new leader Remnick move this.

921
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:21,060
Um, I was speaking with an investment
manager about this and he had,

922
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:25,180
it was consistent with a study he had
done of stock performance following

923
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:27,610
founders,
CEOs departing their businesses.

924
00:56:28,210 --> 00:56:31,780
And you found that any subsequent positive
stock performance was correlated with

925
00:56:31,781 --> 00:56:35,590
the founder completely leaving the board
rather than hanging around to mentor

926
00:56:35,591 --> 00:56:39,010
the next CEO.
So through that Lens,

927
00:56:39,010 --> 00:56:42,670
Gates remaining on the Microsoft
board during bombers tenure may have

928
00:56:42,671 --> 00:56:46,120
contributed to subsequent lack luster,
stock performance,

929
00:56:46,121 --> 00:56:49,630
embalmers inability to kind of
exert his own creative vision,

930
00:56:49,930 --> 00:56:54,820
whereas bomber leaving the Board has
allowed Satya Nadella to fully assert his

931
00:56:54,821 --> 00:56:56,710
own creative vision.

932
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:02,550
I encounter this dynamic of myself
sometimes in running a multifamily office

933
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:07,720
where we manage money for Forbes 500
families and second and third generation

934
00:57:07,721 --> 00:57:11,400
sometimes struggle with how to relate
to the original patriarch and the quote

935
00:57:11,401 --> 00:57:13,440
source of their wealth.
And it's,

936
00:57:14,370 --> 00:57:19,370
my observation is often the responsibility
room for real transition is in the

937
00:57:19,831 --> 00:57:21,090
hands of the original source.

938
00:57:21,450 --> 00:57:26,450
It's the lesson from George
Washington's song in Hamilton musical.

939
00:57:26,790 --> 00:57:30,840
As Washington declines, Hamilton's plead
around for a third term and he sings,

940
00:57:30,841 --> 00:57:32,430
we're going to teach
them how to say goodbye.

941
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:38,420
What purchase of $100 or less has most
positively impacted your life in the last

942
00:57:38,421 --> 00:57:40,520
six months or in recent memory?

943
00:57:41,370 --> 00:57:44,520
So I recently bought the
fitness F I n I s swim pedals.

944
00:57:44,850 --> 00:57:49,850
They somewhat magically lengthen out my
freestyle stroke and when I combine them

945
00:57:51,030 --> 00:57:54,050
with some fins, I use the
ones from Cressy, crae,

946
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:59,060
Ssi feel sometimes like almost flying
through the water for non-swimmers.

947
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:04,390
I highly recommend the canned
sardines from [inaudible] mat I. Z.

948
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:08,880
I feel like one of my
proudest accomplishments as
a dad is that my two younger

949
00:58:08,881 --> 00:58:11,670
kids eat sardines with me
most mornings for breakfast.

950
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:14,700
They're super high protein,
high good fats.

951
00:58:14,701 --> 00:58:18,780
There's no need to supplement fish
oil and Mathias sardines aren't fishy.

952
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:23,730
I usually add avocado with salt and
lemon and the kids love him and I often

953
00:58:23,731 --> 00:58:26,760
alternate the sardines with
canned wild salmon belly,

954
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:31,860
which they call [inaudible], r e s t
r Eca from the company. Vital choice.

955
00:58:32,850 --> 00:58:36,050
The bonus on both of those is that
when the Zombie apocalypse comes,

956
00:58:36,051 --> 00:58:38,340
she you'll have canned food ready to go.

957
00:58:39,530 --> 00:58:43,580
How has a failure or apparent
failure set you up for later success?

958
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:46,280
Do you have any favorite failure of yours?

959
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:48,410
I have so many failures.

960
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:53,650
I'm just going to pick one and my role
in in investing in and seating investment

961
00:58:54,321 --> 00:58:54,920
firms,

962
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:58,910
I do really extensive reference checks
on people in order to try to accelerate

963
00:58:58,911 --> 00:59:02,990
the process of building mutual trust
with them and I should note that I have a

964
00:59:02,991 --> 00:59:06,980
somewhat oddly specific aspiration to
be the best in the world are among the

965
00:59:06,981 --> 00:59:09,920
best in the world in terms of being
able to really do a reference on someone

966
00:59:10,770 --> 00:59:13,970
they feel like it's a real art form to
gather private information in the form of

967
00:59:13,971 --> 00:59:18,890
multiple perspectives about how someone
has played a repeat iteration game in

968
00:59:18,891 --> 00:59:22,700
the past and then try to accurately
how you're going to play in the future.

969
00:59:23,370 --> 00:59:26,690
I had to find success as gathering
enough honest perspectives on someone to

970
00:59:26,691 --> 00:59:30,620
mimic how I would know someone if I had
sat next to them at work for five years.

971
00:59:31,790 --> 00:59:32,601
We at least truck.

972
00:59:32,601 --> 00:59:36,560
We tried to do references in person and
it's a huge time investment and link

973
00:59:36,620 --> 00:59:40,130
2007 I was about to back a firm and we
conducted a final reference check with

974
00:59:40,131 --> 00:59:40,851
the investment manager,

975
00:59:40,851 --> 00:59:45,380
his former boss who was quite negative
and skeptical about his former analyst.

976
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:49,580
I remember I asked him what percentile
the analyst was in terms of all the

977
00:59:49,581 --> 00:59:53,630
analysts who'd ever worked for him
and he said top 60% which I thought I

978
00:59:53,631 --> 00:59:57,890
misheard it first and I've never gotten
that response again in a reference and

979
00:59:57,891 --> 01:00:00,740
it surprise me given that the analysts
had given me this guy's name as a

980
01:00:00,741 --> 01:00:02,300
reference.
It wasn't an off list reference.

981
01:00:02,301 --> 01:00:06,230
He was on his list and it made me pause.
I'm proceeding with the investment,

982
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:09,470
which then proceeded to
work out amazingly well.

983
01:00:09,471 --> 01:00:13,550
As the financial crisis unfolded and I
had a lot of regret about the size of the

984
01:00:13,551 --> 01:00:15,830
profits I missed.
Later on an emergency,

985
01:00:15,850 --> 01:00:19,430
the reference source may have had an
agenda to sabotage his former proteges new

986
01:00:19,431 --> 01:00:20,130
firm.

987
01:00:20,130 --> 01:00:23,510
Then several years later I was evaluating
another investment manager to partner

988
01:00:23,511 --> 01:00:26,330
with in toward the end of our diligence
process. I got another reverence,

989
01:00:26,370 --> 01:00:28,160
not quite as negative as that one,

990
01:00:28,161 --> 01:00:32,150
but it was mixed and but I felt like
at this point I was better able to hold

991
01:00:32,180 --> 01:00:36,710
multiple prospective simultaneously
without experiencing cognitive dissonance.

992
01:00:37,190 --> 01:00:40,910
It's like the state of negative capability
that Keith's referring to as useful

993
01:00:40,911 --> 01:00:41,744
to writers.

994
01:00:42,170 --> 01:00:46,400
And this time having those mixed data
points only me only made me do more work

995
01:00:46,401 --> 01:00:50,180
and I gained even more conviction in the
character and competence of the miss my

996
01:00:50,181 --> 01:00:53,930
manager and that investment has ended
up being super profitable and I think

997
01:00:53,931 --> 01:00:55,130
absent my earlier failure,

998
01:00:55,310 --> 01:00:58,010
I wouldn't have had the ability to
see the reality of the situation.

999
01:00:58,580 --> 01:01:02,480
And it also just helped me
appreciate something I try to do,

1000
01:01:02,481 --> 01:01:05,210
which is I try to hold people's
perspectives with a light grip,

1001
01:01:06,050 --> 01:01:09,500
which is the knowledge that they and I
have very incomplete maps of reality.

1002
01:01:10,310 --> 01:01:14,060
What are bad recommendations that you
hear in your profession or area of

1003
01:01:14,061 --> 01:01:18,800
expertise? So I think people
massively overuse the term hedge fund.

1004
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:21,200
They fetishize it a little too much.

1005
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:26,210
It reminds me a little bit of a similar
issue is that Ray Dalio found when they,

1006
01:01:26,420 --> 01:01:30,890
when he used the word depression in
2008 to describe some of the underlying

1007
01:01:30,891 --> 01:01:31,910
dynamics in the economy,

1008
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:34,970
he found that his readers had
too much baggage with the word.

1009
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,250
So we switched to using
the word deep process.

1010
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:43,240
And Yuval Harari makes a similar kind
of reframing move by referring to us as

1011
01:01:43,571 --> 01:01:47,200
CPS because we have so much baggage.
But being human and being in the Senate,

1012
01:01:47,210 --> 01:01:47,391
you know,

1013
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:52,391
being in the center of the species who
the most important species and in a

1014
01:01:53,271 --> 01:01:55,940
similar way I think people
now have weighed too much
baggage with the word hedge

1015
01:01:55,941 --> 01:01:59,660
fund. The press and the
managers themselves have made,
it almost jumped the shark.

1016
01:02:00,290 --> 01:02:03,320
And I've been telling people lately I
think we should start using h structure or

1017
01:02:03,321 --> 01:02:03,981
something like that,

1018
01:02:03,981 --> 01:02:07,910
but to instead capture the
concept of incentive compensation,

1019
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:12,770
I don't think it's useful to see a hedge
fund or a product or even the hedge

1020
01:02:12,771 --> 01:02:17,330
fund industry because these are just
temporary collections of flawed brilliant

1021
01:02:17,331 --> 01:02:21,030
people who in any given year decide to a
sequel to the movie they made the prior

1022
01:02:21,030 --> 01:02:21,770
year.

1023
01:02:21,770 --> 01:02:25,670
The only product is the set of future
decisions that the portfolio manager makes

1024
01:02:25,830 --> 01:02:28,880
think get divorced or the crest if
they're second in command leaves.

1025
01:02:29,270 --> 01:02:31,310
The quote product completely changes.

1026
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:35,480
And I think thinking of it as a product
ignores the reality that the only source

1027
01:02:35,481 --> 01:02:40,400
of stability is actually whether the
mindset of the team leader is resilient or

1028
01:02:40,401 --> 01:02:41,570
even antifragile,

1029
01:02:41,690 --> 01:02:46,280
which is the Nassim Taleb thing about
actually getting stronger with volatility

1030
01:02:46,281 --> 01:02:47,540
rather than just enduring it.

1031
01:02:48,710 --> 01:02:51,980
When you feel overwhelmed or unfocused,
what do you do?

1032
01:02:53,110 --> 01:02:56,290
So I asked myself what would be
the worst thing about that outcome,

1033
01:02:56,291 --> 01:03:00,610
not going the way I want and actually
started using it out loud with my kids.

1034
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:03,880
And we recently, my eight year old
daughters started asking it back to me,

1035
01:03:04,450 --> 01:03:05,920
which was karmic full circle.

1036
01:03:06,310 --> 01:03:09,550
I really like to be punctual and
we were late to drop her at school.

1037
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,180
And I was impatiently hurrying
her along and she asked me, dad,

1038
01:03:13,181 --> 01:03:15,430
what exactly would be the
worst thing about being late?

1039
01:03:16,270 --> 01:03:18,820
And it in the moment it
completely shifted my mindset.

1040
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:22,840
I like the question cause it often
surfaces a hidden assumption in this case,

1041
01:03:22,841 --> 01:03:27,220
maybe some UB subconscious script of
I'm playing the role of father and our

1042
01:03:27,221 --> 01:03:30,280
family meets our commitments
or some version of that.

1043
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:35,830
And another good related question is
Byron Katie's thing about the opposite of

1044
01:03:35,831 --> 01:03:39,190
your story be true. I think that
that question serves the same role

1045
01:03:40,410 --> 01:03:43,020
in the last five years.
What new belief,

1046
01:03:43,021 --> 01:03:45,750
behavior or habit has
most improved your life?

1047
01:03:47,230 --> 01:03:52,230
I began swimming most mornings and I
find it often shifts my mindset for the

1048
01:03:53,141 --> 01:03:55,590
entire rest of my day there.

1049
01:03:55,780 --> 01:03:58,690
Some swimmers talk about
this concept of water feel,

1050
01:03:58,750 --> 01:04:02,500
which is getting a grip in the water
and pulling your body past that point

1051
01:04:02,530 --> 01:04:04,300
instead of ripping your
hand through the water,

1052
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:07,210
ripping your hand would through
the water moves you forward.

1053
01:04:07,211 --> 01:04:09,640
But it's a lot less
efficient and less graceful.

1054
01:04:10,690 --> 01:04:13,600
And I really liked David
Foster Wallace's speech.

1055
01:04:13,601 --> 01:04:16,840
This is water and where he's making
the point that so much a water,

1056
01:04:16,870 --> 01:04:19,270
so much of life is water to us.
We're swimming in it,

1057
01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:23,320
we can't see it cause we were either in
a hurry or not awake to our context or

1058
01:04:23,321 --> 01:04:25,240
in key and language.
We are subject to it.

1059
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:29,200
And when I stopped to really
feel the water before I pull,

1060
01:04:29,350 --> 01:04:33,700
it shifts my way of being in from one
of kind of thrashing towards the end of

1061
01:04:33,701 --> 01:04:38,701
the pool somewhat mindlessly to a more
effortless flow of working with the

1062
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:40,390
reality of the water where I am.

1063
01:04:41,430 --> 01:04:45,150
What advice would you give to a smart
driven college student about to enter the

1064
01:04:45,151 --> 01:04:45,984
real world?

1065
01:04:46,890 --> 01:04:51,000
So lately I've been thinking about careers
through Dan Siegel's model of mental

1066
01:04:51,001 --> 01:04:56,001
health where he says picture river flowing
between two banks where one side is

1067
01:04:56,311 --> 01:04:58,470
chaos and the other side is rigidity.

1068
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:02,640
And Dan points out that mental illness
is all reside on one bank or the other.

1069
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:04,890
Schizophrenia is on the chaos side,

1070
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:10,080
OCD is rigidity and basically healthy
integration is swimming in the middle of

1071
01:05:10,081 --> 01:05:11,370
the river is his argument.

1072
01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:17,110
And most college students have started
life closer to the rigidity bank is my

1073
01:05:17,111 --> 01:05:17,651
observation.

1074
01:05:17,651 --> 01:05:21,130
And over the course of their careers
will experiment with swimming toward the

1075
01:05:21,131 --> 01:05:25,210
middle. And I've come to think of
the lane right next to rigidity,

1076
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:29,840
the rigidity bank as an appropriately
conventional one four w in your twenties

1077
01:05:29,860 --> 01:05:34,120
when you're in your twenties and you're
kind of acquiring the skill of refining

1078
01:05:34,121 --> 01:05:34,830
reality.

1079
01:05:34,830 --> 01:05:39,010
It's a place to swim where it's important
to learn the jargon of an industry and

1080
01:05:39,011 --> 01:05:42,970
apprentice under somebody to develop
judgment and discover your own zone of

1081
01:05:42,971 --> 01:05:43,710
genius.

1082
01:05:43,710 --> 01:05:46,900
And I think swimming in the Middle Lane
happens most often in people's thirties

1083
01:05:46,901 --> 01:05:50,980
or forties to stage where you begin
crafting your own language for what you do

1084
01:05:51,190 --> 01:05:54,850
as an increasingly strong poet.
You, you make your craft, your own,

1085
01:05:55,140 --> 01:05:58,570
you feel your life is more self
expression than simply playing out other

1086
01:05:58,571 --> 01:05:59,740
people's roles for you.

1087
01:06:00,490 --> 01:06:04,030
And then some small percentage of people
will pedal over to the lane next to

1088
01:06:04,031 --> 01:06:04,864
chaos,

1089
01:06:05,050 --> 01:06:09,400
which is a place where you find novelists
like Robert Parasail egg and David

1090
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:13,990
Foster Wallace investors like Mike burry
or Eddie Lampert or entrepreneurs like

1091
01:06:13,991 --> 01:06:18,520
Steve jobs and Elon Musk and I
experienced them as consistently asserting

1092
01:06:18,521 --> 01:06:22,390
reality a through k through
powerful storytelling,

1093
01:06:22,630 --> 01:06:26,350
while always bearing the risk that their
egos grow too big and their creative

1094
01:06:26,351 --> 01:06:28,270
narcissism gets to well defended,

1095
01:06:28,690 --> 01:06:31,970
they lose situational awareness and they
basically lose their feedback loop with

1096
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:36,130
reality. I visualize them almost
flopping onto the bank of chaos.

1097
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:39,270
And so if you look at it through
this lens, then precincts,

1098
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:43,060
wrestling with sanity towards the end
of his life, Steve Jobs is magical.

1099
01:06:43,061 --> 01:06:47,690
Thinking about his illness and Eddie
Lampert's and Randy and framing of his

1100
01:06:47,691 --> 01:06:51,520
investment in seniors may have all been
examples of these guys losing their feel

1101
01:06:51,521 --> 01:06:55,060
for where they can mythologize to the
point of bending our collective reality.

1102
01:06:55,061 --> 01:06:56,980
And then they suddenly
briefly appear crazy.

1103
01:06:58,420 --> 01:07:02,410
I think Musc in particular drives hedge
fund managers of the wall as half of

1104
01:07:02,411 --> 01:07:06,430
them are short as shares because he exudes
so much promotional hucksterism as he

1105
01:07:06,431 --> 01:07:07,300
asserts reality.

1106
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:11,200
And half of them are long because he's
actually thinking on a hundred year

1107
01:07:11,201 --> 01:07:14,740
timescale and it's very confusing.
And East truck,

1108
01:07:14,890 --> 01:07:18,190
we always say that if you want to have
variant perception it helps to be variant.

1109
01:07:18,460 --> 01:07:21,220
And I remember interviewing Mike Burry,

1110
01:07:21,250 --> 01:07:23,500
Steve Eisman and all the
other somewhat fringe,

1111
01:07:23,501 --> 01:07:27,250
somewhat variant investors who were
shorting subprime mortgages in 2006.

1112
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:29,440
And uh,
the all the,

1113
01:07:29,441 --> 01:07:32,200
basically all the characters that Michael
Lewis captured so accurately in the

1114
01:07:32,201 --> 01:07:36,130
big short and the housing
bubble is obvious in retrospect,

1115
01:07:36,131 --> 01:07:39,070
but at the time almost everyone thought
they were completely smoking dope.

1116
01:07:39,340 --> 01:07:42,220
And the current crypto scene.

1117
01:07:42,370 --> 01:07:46,330
The cryptocurrency scene reminds
me a lot of the subprime short, uh,

1118
01:07:46,331 --> 01:07:51,331
ecosystem because the opportunity attracts
the most or the more variant players

1119
01:07:52,031 --> 01:07:56,240
have nothing to lose from disrupting
the status quo. So I'm crip,

1120
01:07:56,250 --> 01:07:59,410
you've got all the libertarians and the
end employed macro hedge fund managers

1121
01:07:59,411 --> 01:08:00,244
and all the kids.

1122
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:04,750
There's this great quote by one of
the characters and Tom Stoppard's play

1123
01:08:04,751 --> 01:08:08,710
Arcadia, the crypto guys like,
which is the future is disorder.

1124
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:13,720
A door like this has cracked open five
or six times since we got up on her hind

1125
01:08:13,721 --> 01:08:14,554
legs.

1126
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:18,380
It's the best possible time to be alive
when almost everything you thought you

1127
01:08:18,381 --> 01:08:19,214
knew is wrong.

1128
01:08:20,820 --> 01:08:24,090
I think that mentality of
saying bring it on to chaos,

1129
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:28,320
that now that now is the best
possible time to be alive. To quote,

1130
01:08:28,321 --> 01:08:32,370
learn to love the rain is Josh Waitzkin
says it's really hard for people who

1131
01:08:32,371 --> 01:08:34,890
have succeeded in the status quo context.

1132
01:08:36,060 --> 01:08:40,710
And so I think bitcoin could just be
a bubble due to QE post the financial

1133
01:08:40,711 --> 01:08:44,580
crisis or it can be a change in how we
organize human activity at the level of

1134
01:08:44,581 --> 01:08:46,320
the Internet itself or both.

1135
01:08:47,030 --> 01:08:50,640
And I'm at the moment trying to hold both
perspectives without needing to decide

1136
01:08:50,641 --> 01:08:55,320
yet trying to stay, I think of as an open
chair instead of striving for closure.

1137
01:08:57,620 --> 01:09:00,490
I'll finish up the career question
with one last quote from the very self

1138
01:09:00,491 --> 01:09:04,760
transforming Charlie Munger,
who at 93 has no filters left and he,

1139
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:08,420
he's more wisdom percentage than
almost anyone I read. He says,

1140
01:09:09,050 --> 01:09:12,350
I've noticed in a long lifetime that
the people who really love you are the

1141
01:09:12,351 --> 01:09:15,290
people where you scrambled together with
difficulty and you've jointly gotten

1142
01:09:15,291 --> 01:09:19,490
through and in the end those people will
love you more than somebody who just

1143
01:09:19,491 --> 01:09:21,830
shared in an even prosperity
through the whole thing.

1144
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:26,720
So this adversity that seems so awful
when you're scrambling through actually is

1145
01:09:26,721 --> 01:09:29,900
the sinecure of your success, your
affection, every other damn thing.

1146
01:09:30,830 --> 01:09:34,730
The idea that life is a
series of adversities in
each one is an opportunity to

1147
01:09:34,731 --> 01:09:39,170
behave well instead of badly is a very,
very good idea and he says,

1148
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:42,710
and it works so well in old age because
you get so many adversities you can't

1149
01:09:42,711 --> 01:09:46,430
fix, so you better have some technique
for welcoming those adversities.

1150
01:09:47,730 --> 01:09:51,120
Hey guys, this is Tim again. Just a
few more things before you take off.

1151
01:09:51,450 --> 01:09:54,120
Number one,
this is five bullet Friday.

1152
01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:57,360
Do you want to get a short email from me?

1153
01:09:57,390 --> 01:10:00,000
Would you enjoy getting a short
email from me every Friday?

1154
01:10:00,270 --> 01:10:04,530
That provides a little more soul of
fun before the weekend and five bullet

1155
01:10:04,531 --> 01:10:09,150
Friday is a very short email where I share
the coolest things I've found or that

1156
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:10,740
I've been pondering over the week.

1157
01:10:10,950 --> 01:10:13,740
That could include favorite new
albums that I've discovered.

1158
01:10:13,741 --> 01:10:17,190
It could include Gizmos and gadgets
and all sorts of weird shit that I've

1159
01:10:17,191 --> 01:10:21,510
somehow dug up in the other
world of the esoteric as I do.

1160
01:10:21,780 --> 01:10:26,780
It could include favorite articles that
I've read and that I've shared with my

1161
01:10:27,421 --> 01:10:30,150
close friends, for instance,
and it's very short.

1162
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:35,220
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness
before you head off for the weekend,

Tim,

1194
01:12:25,710 --> 01:12:28,530
this episode is brought
to you by a cent protein,

1195
01:12:28,531 --> 01:12:33,531
the cleanest least processed protein
I've ever consumed and I have tried just

1196
01:12:33,931 --> 01:12:37,140
about everything since well
before the four hour body.

1197
01:12:37,470 --> 01:12:40,770
I've started my day with
20 to 30 grams of protein.

1198
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:42,840
First thing that has
been part of my routine,

1199
01:12:43,410 --> 01:12:47,640
but I don't always have the time or
necessarily the desire to cook an entire

1200
01:12:47,641 --> 01:12:49,140
meal,
so what to do.

1201
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:54,090
Protein powders can be a fast way
to get this protein needs met,

1202
01:12:54,150 --> 01:12:58,290
but most products are full of crap.
They're bleached that excess sugar,

1203
01:12:58,770 --> 01:13:02,220
terrible artificial sweeteners or
just straight forward low grade,

1204
01:13:02,490 --> 01:13:07,490
low quality protein ascent contains zero
artificial ingredients and the parent

1205
01:13:08,431 --> 01:13:12,660
company is actually cheese manufacturer
so that they produced their own native

1206
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:14,640
proteins.
It's,

1207
01:13:14,730 --> 01:13:18,720
it's really fascinating and I've looked
at they're processing it takes or it

1208
01:13:18,721 --> 01:13:20,850
took them about five years to develop.

1209
01:13:21,330 --> 01:13:25,980
You can mix the protein in as little as
four ounces without any clumps or issues

1210
01:13:25,981 --> 01:13:29,760
of mixability whatsoever and they nailed
the taste. They tested, for instance,

1211
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:35,430
the chocolate version 282 different
versions. They put a lot of money in.

1212
01:13:35,431 --> 01:13:39,600
A lot of time into r and D
for this particular product.

1213
01:13:39,810 --> 01:13:43,770
If you love coffee, they also have
a brand new cappuccino flavor,

1214
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:46,170
which is a variation I've enjoyed.

1215
01:13:46,470 --> 01:13:50,610
If you prefer to test something outside
of the traditional vanilla or chocolate,

1216
01:13:50,850 --> 01:13:52,950
and they have both way
and my seller casing,

1217
01:13:52,951 --> 01:13:57,780
so if you want to say improve body
composition and recovery overnight

1218
01:13:57,930 --> 01:14:02,070
slow-release, you can take the micellar
Casein or in my case with whey protein,

1219
01:14:02,220 --> 01:14:06,030
I would take postworkout for instance,
or in the morning. Check it out.

1220
01:14:06,060 --> 01:14:08,390
These guys were really fascinating.
