1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,890
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02,891 --> 00:00:06,100
I can run flat out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:07,603
Posting a question.

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,540
I'm a cybernetic organism.

5
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,620
This episode is brought
to you by freshbooks.

6
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,460
Freshbooks is become the goto cloud
accounting software for literally millions

7
00:00:30,461 --> 00:00:32,710
of small business owners
who found a faster,

8
00:00:32,711 --> 00:00:35,950
more efficient and much less stressful
way to deal with their numbers and

9
00:00:35,951 --> 00:00:39,730
ultimately this helps you to
focus on what you are best at.

10
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:43,610
It is used by many of the fastest growing
startups I've invested in or advise

11
00:00:43,611 --> 00:00:47,500
and it's equally used by many of the best
freelancers I work with on a daily or

12
00:00:47,501 --> 00:00:51,880
weekly basis. It is one of the easiest
ways to send invoices, get paid,

13
00:00:51,881 --> 00:00:55,780
track your time and track your clients
if you're self employed and managing

14
00:00:55,781 --> 00:00:58,600
business sometimes means
wrestling with spreadsheets,

15
00:00:58,601 --> 00:01:02,500
crumbled receipts and other scattered
pieces. Freshbooks can really help.

16
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,800
Freshbooks allows you to do many,
many different things very easily.

17
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:09,550
Preparing and sending a polished branded
invoice. It takes about 30 seconds.

18
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:12,970
You can set yourself up to receive online
payments from your clients in about

19
00:01:12,971 --> 00:01:13,630
two clicks,

20
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:17,320
which on average we'll get you paid
twice as fast they're new proposals.

21
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,530
Feature means you can include a project
summary and timeline is part of your

22
00:01:20,531 --> 00:01:23,440
estimate. There are many, many
other things. Tracking your time,

23
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:26,980
the quick proposals that I mentioned,
formatting free, super easy,

24
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:30,700
late payment reminders so you don't have
to chase people. Automatic expenses,

25
00:01:30,701 --> 00:01:34,660
sharing files and messages with your
client's award winning customer service.

26
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,540
They are extremely responsive.

27
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:41,500
The interface is super intuitive and
there's almost no learning curve,

28
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,870

This episode is brought
to you by legal zoom,

37
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,620
which more than 2 million Americans have
used to help start their businesses.

38
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:24,090
Past guests even such as,
well, wordpress lead developer,

39
00:02:24,091 --> 00:02:28,350
CEO of Automattic, Matt Mullenweg now
valued at more than a billion dollars,

40
00:02:28,351 --> 00:02:30,930
have used legal zoom to help
with their business needs,

41
00:02:30,931 --> 00:02:33,060
specifically in his case
to form his company,

42
00:02:33,061 --> 00:02:36,150
but legal zoom isn't just
for launching your business.

43
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,260
Their services include everything from
helping you to manage changing tax laws,

44
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:44,820
reviewing contracts, creating Ndas,
nondisclosure agreements, important stuff,

45
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:49,680
handling lease agreements and assisting
with really any other legal challenge,

46
00:02:49,681 --> 00:02:54,120
hurdle, inconvenience that typically takes
time and effort away from running your

47
00:02:54,121 --> 00:02:54,954
business.

48
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,410
The best part is that you
won't get charged by the
hour because legal zoom isn't

49
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,100
a law firm,

50
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:04,100
so they won't be running the clock up
and spinning circles just to raise your

51
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,830
bill.
Instead,

52
00:03:05,831 --> 00:03:09,430
they just ask you to pay one low upfront
price for whatever it is that you're

53
00:03:09,431 --> 00:03:10,870
looking to get all the card style.

54
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,520

56
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:22,150
that's the terminology in
the copy that they suggest.

57
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,110
I don't know what the special savings
is folks, but it's titillating.

61
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,091
Hello boys and girls.

62
00:03:42,091 --> 00:03:45,150
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another
episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

63
00:03:45,151 --> 00:03:49,050
it is my job to interview and
deconstruct world class performers of all

64
00:03:49,051 --> 00:03:53,430
different types from business,
sports, military chess, you name it,

65
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:54,383
science.

66
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:59,510
We bounced all over the place and this
episode is going to be wide ranging,

67
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:02,040
not only focused on business or investing,

68
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,290
although we do have an all
star in both of those arenas.

69
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,840
The guest is Scott Belsky.

70
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:12,440
He is one of the people I call most
for advice on a wide range of topics.

71
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:15,720
Who Scott at Twitter at?
Scott Belsky,

72
00:04:15,721 --> 00:04:20,550
B L S K Y Scott belsky.com Scott is
an entrepreneur, author, investor,

73
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:24,000
and currently chief product
officer of Adobe. Big,

74
00:04:24,001 --> 00:04:27,480
big company might have heard of it.
He's also a venture partner at benchmark,

75
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:31,500
one of the most famous venture
capital firms anywhere.

76
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:33,390
But this one based in San Francisco,

77
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:38,160
Scott cofounded by Hanson 2006 and served
as CEO until Adobe acquired the hands

78
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:42,300
in 2012 millions of people use the hands
to display their portfolios as well as

79
00:04:42,301 --> 00:04:45,240
track and find top talent
across creative industries.

80
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:50,690
He is also a incredibly successful early
stage investor and advisor who has been

81
00:04:53,731 --> 00:04:56,910
involved with companies like
Pinterest, Uber, periscope, among many,

82
00:04:56,911 --> 00:04:58,890
many other fast growing startups.

83
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:03,570
And his latest project is a compendium
of insights and tactics for what Scott

84
00:05:03,571 --> 00:05:05,400
calls the messy middle.

85
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:10,350
We all know we have that initial euphoric
start to big projects or companies.

86
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:14,940
And then you enter what you
might have heard of in uh,

87
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:17,850
perhaps incubator parlance.
In this case,

88
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:21,750
y Combinator I believe refers to
it as the, the trough of sorrow.

89
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:26,810
So you have this initial burst of
adrenaline and then there is a long middle

90
00:05:26,821 --> 00:05:29,160
period with any type of creative endeavor.

91
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:34,140
They can get really messy and that is
where a lot of people give up or get

92
00:05:34,141 --> 00:05:36,150
destroyed in one fashion or another.

93
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,810
And then there are people who make it to
the last mile and ultimately complete,

94
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:44,040
uh, many of these projects or have type
some type of acquisition or exit with

95
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:47,190
startup.
So this episode covers a lot of ground.

96
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:50,490
We talked about a lot
of these tactics and uh,

97
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:54,360
if for whatever reason you're thinking,
you know what, I want to listen to this,

98
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,620
Scott sounds interesting,

99
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:59,570
but I don't want to focus exclusively
business stuff or business building.

100
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:03,590
Don't worry. There's a lot
in here that transcends that.

101
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:08,650
And specifically we shift locations and
number of times in this episode we end

102
00:06:11,331 --> 00:06:12,830
up in the sauna at one point.

103
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:18,220
And if you want a real life example of
how I ask my friends for help because I

104
00:06:18,741 --> 00:06:20,930
was getting all wound up about a very,

105
00:06:20,931 --> 00:06:24,050
very top of mind situation when
Scott showed up at my house,

106
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:29,410
jump about 55 minutes ahead from
where we begin the interview.

107
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,150
Uh, so the easiest way to
do that if you want to,

108
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:37,130
that's when we are in the sauna and I
ask him for help is as soon as we start

109
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:42,020
kind of hop an hour into the audio or
so and then jump back like five minutes

110
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,610
and it should be around there.

111
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:48,260
But there's a ton of of stuff that you
can mine that it's interview Scott is a

112
00:06:48,261 --> 00:06:52,550
great guy and I had a blast
hanging with him and uh,

113
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:57,820
with that I will let you also through
your ears hang with none other than Scott

114
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:00,613
Dusky.

115
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:07,530
Scott, welcome to the show. Thanks to
him. Here we are at the kitchen table.

116
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,900
I didn't think we would
have a chapter two today.

117
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:14,930
We met earlier for some oysters and
beverages and caught up and I was picking

118
00:07:17,821 --> 00:07:22,740
your brain on a number of different
things and we were trading stories and I

119
00:07:22,741 --> 00:07:25,680
realized that you have, and you're
gonna know what I'm referring to,

120
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:30,870
how many Evernote notes?
Well a lot of Evernote notes,

121
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,800
but specific to what we'll be talking
about, I think it was a, this,

122
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:39,120
it started at maybe 830 or so a couple
of years ago when I started trimming it

123
00:07:39,121 --> 00:07:43,650
down.
And you've been capturing lessons learned,

124
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:49,040
Maxim's mantras for yourself in the
process of developing this career.

125
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:56,490
And I hope this doesn't come off the
wrong way, but you've worn so many hats.

126
00:07:56,491 --> 00:07:57,870
It isn't a single career.

127
00:07:57,871 --> 00:08:01,890
It seems like you've lived many different
lives and people have already heard

128
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,370
the bio that I read in the intro,

129
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:10,400
but perhaps you could indicate the
roles that you've had in the companies,

130
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:14,040
uh, that you've been a part
of because they are so varied.

131
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:18,030
And I just want to underscore
how eclectic it is. Yeah.

132
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:20,850
A collectic for better or
for worse. Um, but, uh,

133
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,440
I was an entrepreneur back in
2005 starting a very small,

134
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:29,730
almost a lifestyle business at that point
to help organize the creative world.

135
00:08:29,731 --> 00:08:33,210
A company called [inaudible],
five years of bootstrapping, um,

136
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:38,010
as a small team valuing resourcefulness
over the resources. We didn't have,

137
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,400
uh, a few near death
experiences in that process.

138
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:43,380
Then became a venture backed company,

139
00:08:43,381 --> 00:08:47,210
which is a little bit more of a
traditional silicon valley like story. Um,

140
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,730
being venture backed for a few
years, growing really fast. Um,

141
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:53,300
went through an acquisition,
then started, uh,

142
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:58,330
found myself working in a very big company
as a vice president given what I came

143
00:08:58,441 --> 00:09:02,190
in with as well as a few other
projects and a few new muscles.

144
00:09:02,191 --> 00:09:06,750
They're navigating a big, a big
corporate experience. Then I decided,

145
00:09:06,751 --> 00:09:09,600
you know what, I've been a seed
investor for a while. I like this.

146
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,490
People are telling me I should be.
An investor.

147
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:14,760
Jumped in and became a general
partner at a venture capital firm.

148
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:19,920
Total context switch, uh, learned a
lot of things. I'm the hard way. Um,

149
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:24,600
then realized I miss building,
wanting to get back to it. Now, uh,

150
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:27,630
am an executive at a big
public company. Um, Adobe,

151
00:09:27,631 --> 00:09:31,740
the same company that acquired
us, but totally new position.
And I would say that,

152
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:36,070
uh, whenever I think about, um, best
practices, if there was ever such a.
