1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,320
The common characteristic of the people
who had the most time and the highest

2
00:00:04,321 --> 00:00:06,840
income is the ability to single task.

3
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:10,860
So single tasking being the
opposite of multitasking.

4
00:00:10,861 --> 00:00:14,700
So to identify the
critical few objectives,

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:20,150
separate them from the trivial many
and focus exclusively on one of them to

6
00:00:21,001 --> 00:00:24,390
completion without interruption.
Because the

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,920
default mode in especially a web 2.0 user
generated universe and I would include

8
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:36,840
email and user generated is it's very
easy to simulate forward motion without

9
00:00:36,841 --> 00:00:41,310
accomplishing anything. And you cannot
possibly as much as we'd like to think so,

10
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:45,330
uh, organize and consume the
information that is presented to you.

11
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,350
So the only option left is to cultivate
this selective ignorance where you act

12
00:00:49,351 --> 00:00:53,520
on the most important things. So I'll,
I'll, I want to hit a few concepts,

13
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,350
a few findings that you can
apply immediately and then
we'll jump into Q. And. A.

14
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:04,190
So the first is a concept you may be
familiar with called the 80 20 principle.

15
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,630
Hence,
you could look at a company like Ryan Air,

16
00:01:06,631 --> 00:01:08,040
which has some ridiculous number,

17
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:11,690
like one point $4 million of
profit per employee. Okay.

18
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,060
There's a related principle

19
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:21,860
called Parkinson's law, uh, which I'd like
to explain briefly and then people can,

20
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:22,723
can play with it.

21
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,860
Parkinson's law indicates that a task
will swell and perceived importance and

22
00:01:27,901 --> 00:01:32,160
complexity in direct correlation to
the time that you allotted. Okay.

23
00:01:32,161 --> 00:01:35,190
So we generally think that if I have
more time I'll do a better job. Uh,

24
00:01:35,191 --> 00:01:36,720
this is very,
very seldom the case.

25
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,520
So there are actually two ways that
you can identify the critical few and

26
00:01:41,521 --> 00:01:43,680
separate them from the trivial many.
Number one is to do an 80,

27
00:01:43,681 --> 00:01:46,590
20 analysis with the
metrics that you've chosen.

28
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:51,030
And the number two is to limit the time,

29
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,460
so to use very short deadlines.
So in essence,

30
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:58,490
you're limiting the tasks to very few
to limit the time invested or you're

31
00:01:58,921 --> 00:02:03,921
limiting the time invested to force you
to focus on the critical few decreasing

32
00:02:04,681 --> 00:02:05,400
inputs.

33
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,480
And increasing output I
think is the easiest way to
frame how we want to look at

34
00:02:09,481 --> 00:02:13,260
time. And, uh, there are a few
ways to do that, but one of the,

35
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:16,470
one of the key variables
as information intake.

36
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,440
So you can either consume information
or you can focus on production and you

37
00:02:19,441 --> 00:02:20,880
could really can't do
both at the same time.

38
00:02:20,881 --> 00:02:25,470
It's a one way street before you
look at delegating, you can automate,

39
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:30,660
but related to both of those is
taking the most time consuming tasks.

40
00:02:30,661 --> 00:02:35,550
So there will be some that remain and
really defining the process. Okay.

41
00:02:35,551 --> 00:02:39,330
Now this sounds like Gobbledygook tech
business talk and I'll put it into

42
00:02:39,331 --> 00:02:43,830
concrete terms.
Most people check email in very,

43
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:48,000
very specific ways and email being one
of the most time consuming activities.

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,270
They're afraid of outsourcing that or
delegating it to someone else because I'm

45
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:53,310
the only one who can check my email.
Well,

46
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:58,170
the fact of the matter is I get somewhere
between four and 5,000 email a week.

47
00:02:58,290 --> 00:02:59,530
Okay.
So it's,

48
00:02:59,531 --> 00:03:04,030
I'm pretty sure I'm at the top of the
room here or at least towards the top and

49
00:03:04,031 --> 00:03:06,280
I have multiple email accounts
and multiple people helping me.

50
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:11,310
But one of my key assistants
has a document called Tim
Ferriss processing rules

51
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:17,680
and this is a working document
of explicitly how I check email.

52
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:22,090
So I had to take my internal process
and define it and put it on paper.

53
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:26,080
What am I looking for? How do I decide
which I reply to which I delete,

54
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:28,120
which I postpone.
How do I archive?

55
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:33,280
And she has essentially a step by
step guide to my cognitive process for

56
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:34,270
processing email.

57
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:38,620
She receives 90% of my
email goes through it.

58
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,990
And then each day we have
a call at 4:00 PM where it,

59
00:03:42,991 --> 00:03:47,050
she'll have the name of the
person, company affiliation,
what they want me to do.

60
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,100
All the rest are details.

61
00:03:48,101 --> 00:03:52,060
So those are the three top disqualifiers
I've taken a task that would take me

62
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:56,800
well over a hundred hours a week and it
drops it down to less than five minutes

63
00:03:56,801 --> 00:03:59,800
a day. I listened to her voicemail.
As I'm typing out the email,

64
00:03:59,801 --> 00:04:03,670
she numbers each of the to do items.
So I just do one, do this, two do this,

65
00:04:03,671 --> 00:04:06,850
three do this. Okay. And
that's not limited to CEOs.
