1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,840
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:06,180
I can run flat out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,980
I'm a cybernetic organism living.

4
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:26,630
This episode is brought
to you by four sigmatic.

5
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,450
You might remember Fort Sigmadek
for their mushroom coffee,

6
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,650
which was created by those clever finished
founders and when I first mentioned

7
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,040
that coffee on this podcast,
the product sold out in less than a week.

8
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:41,120
It lights you up like a Christmas tree,
which can be really useful. However,

9
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:45,530
recently I've been testing the opposite
side of the spectrum of new product and

10
00:00:45,531 --> 00:00:50,360
that is their Reishi mushroom elixir
to help me end my day to get to sleep.

11
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:53,270
As you guys may know,
longtime listeners,

12
00:00:53,271 --> 00:00:55,370
at least I struggled with
insomnia for decades.

13
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,120
I have a largely fixed that but still
shutting off my monkey brain has never

14
00:00:59,121 --> 00:01:02,810
been easy, still isn't easy
very often and I found Reishi,

15
00:01:02,811 --> 00:01:06,200
which I've been fascinated by for
a few years now, has been very,

16
00:01:06,201 --> 00:01:09,470
very effective and
calming their old formula,

17
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:13,730
however four Sigmadek old formula
included Stevia and I like to avoid

18
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,050
sweeteners,

19
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:20,050
all sweeteners for a host of reasons
and I then just ping them and asked,

20
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:25,550
hey guys, I would love to experiment
with this and maybe actually suggested,

21
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:29,000
but I'd like a version without
sweeteners if you'd be open to it,

22
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,290
if too much of a headache,
don't worry.

23
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:34,430
And they are always game
for experimentation.

24
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:38,150
So they created a special custom version
without the Stevia, without sweeteners.

25
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:40,730
Now it is part of my nightly routine.

26
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,820
Their ratio elixir comes
in single serving packets,

27
00:01:43,821 --> 00:01:46,790
which are perfect for travel and in fact
I'm about to leave the country right

28
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:48,320
now and I have a packet in front of me.

29
00:01:48,321 --> 00:01:51,860
This just going to sit in
the end of my carry on bag.

30
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,820
You only need hot water and it mixes very,
very easily.

31
00:01:56,330 --> 00:02:00,590
Here's some recommended copy
that they put in the read,

32
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:03,620
so I'm going to read it and then
I'll give you my take quote,

33
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,900
a warning for those in
the experimental mindset,

34
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,440
Reishi is strong and bitter in
parentheses, like any great medicine.

35
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,000
So if the bitterness is too much,

36
00:02:11,001 --> 00:02:15,330
I recommend trying it with honey end or
nut milk such as almond milk and quote.

37
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,480
So I'm going to say no,

38
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:22,010
you should suck it up and you should drink
the tea because it's not that bitter.

39
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,240
And maybe should take the advice of all
Chinese people when they're criticizing

40
00:02:26,241 --> 00:02:28,760
younguns. When they say
Boone Ung. Sure. Cool.

41
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:33,680
Which means you're not able to eat
bitterness. Bitter is in many cases,

42
00:02:33,681 --> 00:02:37,280
an indication of things that help
liver detoxification and so on.

43
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,080
Not saying that's the case here,

44
00:02:39,081 --> 00:02:43,850
but I've tested this ratio
lecture on family members,

45
00:02:43,851 --> 00:02:47,690
on friends. Everybody has liked it. It's
a little bit earthy. It's not that hard.

46
00:02:47,691 --> 00:02:50,180
So I would just say suck it up and no,

47
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:54,350
don't put in honey or milk or any of
that shit. Just drink the goddamn tea.

48
00:02:54,351 --> 00:02:57,470
It's delicious, I think. Right? If
you like poo air, that kind of stuff,

49
00:02:57,471 --> 00:03:01,000
that type of tea, you're going
to dig it. So just try it. Okay.

50
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,110
Back to then my read. If you'd like
to naturally improve your sleep,

51
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,030
both onset and quality,

52
00:03:07,031 --> 00:03:12,031
I think naturally you might just enjoy
this ratio lecture without any sweet

53
00:03:12,471 --> 00:03:16,780
nurse. It has organic, Reishi
extract, organic fueled, mint extract,

54
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:21,250
organic rose hips extract, organic
Tulsi extract. And that's it.

55
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:26,410
No fancy stuff, no artificial watching
McCall at anything. So check it out.

68
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,200
This episode is brought to you
by fresh books, man. Oh Man.

69
00:04:23,201 --> 00:04:27,670
Do a lot of listeners of this podcast
and readers of mine love fresh books to

70
00:04:27,671 --> 00:04:31,330
the extent that I ended up meeting
with the CEO not very long ago.

71
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,460
Why are they so popular?
Well,

72
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,690
they are the number one cloud accounting
software designed exclusively for self

73
00:04:37,691 --> 00:04:39,040
employed professionals.

74
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,830
That's many of you and used by
more than 10 million people.

75
00:04:41,831 --> 00:04:45,820
You can send invoices, track your
time, and get paid very, very quickly,

76
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:50,410
which suits the needs of a
lot of freelancers, a lot
of [inaudible] and beyond.

77
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,660
You can't take pictures of receipts.

78
00:04:52,661 --> 00:04:54,130
You can link your credit
card and debit card,

79
00:04:54,131 --> 00:04:59,110
so all the things you buy automatically
appear in your fresh books in the right

80
00:04:59,111 --> 00:05:02,710
category, so on and so forth. Makes
taxes easy, makes invoices easy,

81
00:05:02,711 --> 00:05:07,420
it makes your life easier.
And also in fact I would recommend a pdf.

82
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,340
Uh, they didn't ask me to
read this part by the way.

83
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:14,170
They'd put the other pdf a while back
called breaking the time barrier subtitle,

84
00:05:14,171 --> 00:05:17,200
how to unlock your true earning potential
so you can search for breaking the

85
00:05:17,201 --> 00:05:19,450
time barrier.
A lot of people ask me,

86
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:22,960
how can I get a four hour work
week with a service business?

87
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:27,670
And the story in that Ebook, it's pdf is
the short answer is really, really good.

88
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:30,460
So I think you should also check that out.
So breaking the time error,

89
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:34,090
checking out,
but also why not test out freshbooks.

00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,930
Hello boys and girls,
ladies and germs.

97
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:09,280
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another
episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

98
00:06:09,281 --> 00:06:13,630
it is my job every episode to
deconstruct world class performers,

99
00:06:13,631 --> 00:06:18,100
people who are excellent, if not the
best at what they do in many, many,

100
00:06:18,101 --> 00:06:18,851
many different fields.

101
00:06:18,851 --> 00:06:23,851
And that scratchiness is Tim Ferriss
coming off of antibiotics because I had

102
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,450
some little gremlins inside me that
I brought back from the Amazon.

103
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:33,130
That's a separate story. In
any case, my job dot. De de,
De de, De, de construct, Dah,

104
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,630
Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah many fields.

105
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:39,100
And this particular episode
we have a wonderful guest,

106
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:43,340
Jack Kornfield.
Alice Walker Calls Jack Quote,

107
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,830
one of the greatest spiritual teachers
of our time and quit jack trained as a

108
00:06:47,831 --> 00:06:51,180
Buddhist monk in the monasteries
of Thailand, India and
Burma. Shortly thereafter,

109
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:54,640
becoming one of the key teachers to
introduce Buddhist mindfulness practice to

110
00:06:54,641 --> 00:06:55,474
the West.

111
00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:00,540
He has taught meditation internationally
since 1974 that's before I was even a

112
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,940
glimmer in my papa die.
So it's been teaching for a very,

113
00:07:03,941 --> 00:07:08,941
very long time and he has had a profound
and direct impact directly on my life.

114
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:15,100
So I'm thrilled to finally have him on
the podcast to share our shared history,

115
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:20,370
his incredible stories and the practical
tactics and very detailed techniques

116
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,530
that you can use and we
dig into all of that.

117
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:28,580
You can also say hi to him on the
Internet at Jack Kornfield on Twitter.

118
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:33,490
Check it out. Jack's history.
Just a little bit, won't
spend too much time on it.

119
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,490
Jack cofounded,
the insight meditation society in Barre,

120
00:07:36,491 --> 00:07:39,490
Massachusetts with fellow meditation
teachers, Sharon Salzberg,

121
00:07:39,491 --> 00:07:43,600
who's also been on this podcast and
Joseph Goldstein and the later the spirit

122
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:47,650
rock center in Woodacre, California, which
is where I did my first silent retreat.

123
00:07:47,651 --> 00:07:50,980
And we talk about that.
He holds a phd in clinical psychology,

124
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:54,370
which is important to me and comes into
this conversation because he's a very,

125
00:07:54,371 --> 00:07:58,990
very diverse toolkit for dealing
with many different types of personal

126
00:07:58,991 --> 00:08:02,890
challenges, issues, questions and so on.
And as a father, husband and activist,

127
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,010
his books have been translated into 20
languages and sold more than a million

128
00:08:06,011 --> 00:08:09,130
copies. He is prolific. His books include,

129
00:08:09,131 --> 00:08:12,670
and I pulled some of you for
your favorites, a wise heart.

130
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:15,730
That's number one,
a lamp in the darkness,

131
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:20,260
a path with heart after the ecstasy,
the laundry,

132
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:22,840
one of my favorite book title of all time.
And his most recent book,

133
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:25,390
no time like the present subtitle,
finding freedom,

134
00:08:25,391 --> 00:08:26,920
love and joy right where you are.

135
00:08:26,921 --> 00:08:31,921
He is quite possibly the most purely
compassionate human being I've ever

136
00:08:32,231 --> 00:08:35,140
interacted with. And compassion
isn't a word that I use very much,

137
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:40,620
but Jack is unique and I'm thrilled to
give you a window into his story and his

138
00:08:42,401 --> 00:08:43,480
teachings.
Without further ado,

139
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:47,160
please enjoy this wide ranging
conversation with Jack Cornfield.

140
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:54,490
Jack, welcome to the show. Oh, thank
you Tim. And pleasure to reconnect.

141
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,920
I have

142
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:00,980
wanted to have you on the show for some
time now and you've had certainly a

143
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,850
tremendous impact on my life,
uh,

144
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:09,480
both through your writing and through
a firsthand in person interaction,

145
00:09:09,481 --> 00:09:10,590
which I think we'll touch upon.

146
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:16,010
But first I wanted to ask you a
complete non sequitur from that,

147
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:18,900
which is something that our mutual friend,

148
00:09:18,901 --> 00:09:22,410
Adam Gazzaley suggested I ask you about.
And Adam,

149
00:09:22,411 --> 00:09:25,050
for people who don't know
him is an incredible, uh,

150
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:29,550
PhD MD neuroscientist based at UCF.

151
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,530
And he suggested that I
ask you about hang gliding.

152
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:39,750
And I have no idea why he suggested that,
but I'm going to start there.

153
00:09:39,751 --> 00:09:42,930
And if it doesn't go anywhere,
we can, we can change direction.

154
00:09:42,931 --> 00:09:45,750
But I figured we would just start with
that and then we're going to rewind the

155
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:49,230
clock. But why did he suggest
I ask you about hang gliding?

156
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:50,450
Well,

157
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:55,450
it started many years ago when I cross
country with a friend who had a hang

158
00:09:57,441 --> 00:10:02,100
glider and we would stop periodically
and go off different hills.

159
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,680
Um,
and it was fantastic.

160
00:10:03,681 --> 00:10:06,950
And then I wanted to do paragliding
and started to learn it.

161
00:10:06,951 --> 00:10:11,720
Now because everything is developed
and paragliding slot, you know,

162
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:15,590
is a lot more official. You need
a license, which I don't have,

163
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:20,890
but one of my favorite things is to
tandem paraglide and go off the top of

164
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,590
places like Grindle walled in, uh, uh,

165
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:31,780
in Switzerland where you can take the
ski lift up to 9,000 feet and then jump

166
00:10:32,181 --> 00:10:34,610
off and float silently.

167
00:10:34,611 --> 00:10:38,330
Like you're a bird among the clouds.

168
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,990
The birds actually do come by sometimes
and like check out what's this big bird

169
00:10:41,991 --> 00:10:46,700
flying up here? You can catch thermals
and go way up above the glaciers.

170
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,880
And um,

171
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:52,490
it's one of the most thrilling and
delicious experiences that I know.

172
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:57,960
That's incredible. So you've, you
first experienced that at what age?

173
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:02,770
Uh, probably in my late twenties. Um,

174
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:06,220
and did some and then
sort of put it aside. Uh,

175
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:09,620
and then I was traveling
and teaching in Europe. Um,

176
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,360
and I saw a sign for paragliding and I
said, oh gosh, I really want to do it.

177
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:15,530
Um,

178
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:20,120
and started and now each time I go where
there's high mountains and paragliding,

179
00:11:20,121 --> 00:11:24,530
that's one of my things that I love
doing. You know, there's something about,

180
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:29,840
I've had most people have these dreams
once in a while. If you're lucky,

181
00:11:29,841 --> 00:11:33,890
a dream of flying or maybe in your
meditation you have the sense of not being

182
00:11:33,891 --> 00:11:36,370
limited to your body. Um, and,

183
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:41,470
and this is the closest thing that I
know cause it's absolutely silent and

184
00:11:41,481 --> 00:11:43,790
you're floating there.
It's quite fantastic.

185
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:49,330
And this is something you still do it
and hope to do it and hope to do it next

186
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:54,340
summer when I'm back in the Alps.
And how, how old are you now? 72

187
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:56,350
72. Good man. Well,

188
00:11:56,351 --> 00:12:01,351
we're going to then go back a bit in
chronology and ask about childhood.

189
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:07,750
I would love to hear you
describe your childhood.

190
00:12:07,751 --> 00:12:10,660
What were you like as a child?
What was your upbringing like?

191
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:14,280
Well,
first thing to say is,

192
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:19,320
I remember when I got to
Dartmouth College in 1963,

193
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:20,310
um,

194
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:25,310
and I called my mom from the payphone
in the dorm sometime in that fall.

195
00:12:25,321 --> 00:12:29,640
I didn't call very often, but you
know how it is. And I said, mom,

196
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:31,350
I said,
guess what?

197
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:35,100
There are a lot of other really
fucked up fat is the side.

198
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:42,440
So that's kind of where we,
where we, where we start. So, uh,

199
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,930
there, uh, yeah, I had three,

200
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:54,110
three brothers and my father was a mixture
of a tyrant and in a really abusive

201
00:12:56,581 --> 00:12:58,910
person and a brilliant guy.
Um,

202
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,610
I was born on and on the Marine base in,
uh,

203
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,190
toward the end of World War Two.

204
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,550
And they didn't send him overseas to do,

205
00:13:08,551 --> 00:13:13,551
they put him in the medical part of the
marines because he tested so high on

206
00:13:13,651 --> 00:13:17,790
their tests that they, you know, okay,
we're gonna use them for something. Um,

207
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:21,770
so he was brilliant in certain
ways. He was a biophysicist who, uh,

208
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:25,230
help design some of the first
artificial hearts and lungs.

209
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,790
Worked on the space program,

210
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:31,791
but also did other kinds of weird
stuff like work for the army,

211
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:36,990
um, biological weapons, people
not making biological weapons.

212
00:13:36,991 --> 00:13:41,340
We're trying to design things
that were kind of computer,

213
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:46,170
um, biological interfaces, all
kinds of creative stuff. But he was,

214
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:49,080
uh,
he was all,

215
00:13:49,081 --> 00:13:52,920
he had mental problems and so we
didn't know when the car pulled in,

216
00:13:52,921 --> 00:13:56,130
whether we were going to get Dr Jekyll
and Mr. Hyde. He would come in and,

217
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:00,810
you know, either he
could shout, be abusive.

218
00:14:00,811 --> 00:14:05,700
Thrilled my mother down the stairs, rant,
Jace after us strive to hit us, whatever.

219
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,210
Or We'd get this
interesting creative person.

220
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,640
But we hardly ever had people come over
when he was around during the daytime is

221
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:17,990
a way we would, um, because you never
knew what you would get. And so, um,

222
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:22,230
our family life in my family
life in some way was also,

223
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,460
there were great parts of it cause I
had my brothers and we were like our own

224
00:14:26,461 --> 00:14:30,050
gang. We moved all the time,
but we had each other. Um,

225
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:34,170
and because he was a
wacky as well as smart,

226
00:14:34,171 --> 00:14:37,860
my father either quit or
got fired every year or two,

227
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,390
and then we would go from one place
to another. I went to, I dunno,

228
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:45,900
eight schools by the time
I finished high school. Um,

229
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:50,010
so my childhood, uh, partly it was,

230
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,450
there were the happy of rough
housing and being a boy with,

231
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:58,220
with three other boys,
um, uh, and adventures.

232
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:03,110
Um, and then in the basement, my father
had all kinds of scientific equipment.

233
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:06,100
He had all this stuff from World War II,

234
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:11,120
this huge radio from a battleship that
you could tune into a thousand different,

235
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:16,220
you know, shortwave stations
around the world. Um, and projects.

236
00:15:16,221 --> 00:15:18,230
He was trying to design stuff.
And so we learned from him,

237
00:15:18,231 --> 00:15:23,030
you could pretty much take or design
or do anything in the physical world.

238
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:26,900
Um, and at the same time, uh,

239
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:32,030
I felt like my whole childhood was also,
uh,

240
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:40,030
how to say it colored with the fear of
his violence and his unpredictability.

241
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:48,590
Um, so and I became kind of
a peacemaker in the family.

242
00:15:48,591 --> 00:15:52,370
We all sort of had our roles and duck.
Now I do it as a profession, right?

243
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:57,140
I'm trying to kind of make it a little
smoother between my parents so they kill

244
00:15:57,141 --> 00:16:01,550
each other. Um, and each of my
brothers had their own strategy.

245
00:16:01,551 --> 00:16:06,140
My twin brother who was a lot
bigger, um, and much more outgoing,

246
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:11,030
um, who played football, which I certainly
didn't. I was skinnier and you know,

247
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,900
I was in the orchestra and he was
the football player. But anyway,

248
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,500
I remember when he first got in a

249
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,360
fist fight with my dad cause
my father was abusing, um,

250
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,490
our mom and,
um,

251
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:32,120
my twin brother had been as young men
sometimes do that was probably 13,

252
00:16:32,121 --> 00:16:35,900
14. I mean, grew pretty big and it
was looking in the mirror, you know,

253
00:16:35,901 --> 00:16:40,640
making muscles in the mirror to see how
strong he'd become. Anyway, he just,

254
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:45,520
you know, uh, got into a fist
fight with my father. Um,

255
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:49,730
and I was both thrilled and terrified.
Um,

256
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:55,560
and uh, but it worked in some
way because of the abuse, uh,

257
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:58,490
settled down quite a lot after that.
So that was his,

258
00:16:58,491 --> 00:17:02,870
his strategy was just to get angry and
then later kind of to go his own way.

259
00:17:02,871 --> 00:17:07,680
Somewhat moral though. We're all all
had been very close as brothers. Um,

260
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:12,350
so there was that at the same
time there was a lot of interest,

261
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:17,240
intellectual interest. So we read and
learned about all kinds of things.

262
00:17:17,241 --> 00:17:21,890
Both my parents were, um, really
interested in the world around us.

263
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,140
And, um, uh,

264
00:17:24,141 --> 00:17:27,890
so it was sort of this
mixed a thing of the,

265
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:29,210
you know,

266
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:33,620
the gift of being together
with my brothers and a mom
who was basically pretty

267
00:17:33,621 --> 00:17:34,280
nurturing,

268
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:39,280
although she kept trying to leave
him and never got it together.

269
00:17:39,561 --> 00:17:44,540
I think it was too scary in the 50s
to have four boys, you know, no job.

270
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:49,010
Um, and so we were in the middle of
this and the kind of healing that it,

271
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,560
it took a long time,
um,

272
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,340
to do the inner healing work from,
um,

273
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:57,800
the pain of my family.
Um,

274
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:02,870
and I remember when I became a Buddhist
monk and I was sitting these first years

275
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,520
with my teacher,

276
00:18:05,521 --> 00:18:10,521
Rajan Cha in the forest monasteries of
Thailand on the border of Thailand and

277
00:18:11,011 --> 00:18:12,470
Laos.
Um,

278
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:18,020
and I've been sitting quietly and then
some of these memories are energy would

279
00:18:18,151 --> 00:18:23,070
come where I remember one monk who
had a hot near mine and the forest did

280
00:18:23,071 --> 00:18:27,270
something that annoyed me and
I just got enraged inside.

281
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,890
And I sat and then I went to the
teacher and I said, you know, um,

282
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:38,640
I'm really getting angry here.
And, uh, he smiled. He said, yeah,

283
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,260
we're, where do you think that comes from?
Or something like that. And I said, well,

284
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:45,660
I don't know. I said, I
thought it was a peaceful guy.

285
00:18:45,661 --> 00:18:49,260
It wasn't never going to be like my
father. I won't, you know, be peaceful.

286
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:52,080
But it turned out I just
stuffed all that stuff.

287
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:55,920
And so when I told my teacher
about it, he said, good. He said,

288
00:18:55,921 --> 00:18:57,960
go back in your heart.
It's the hot season.

289
00:18:57,961 --> 00:19:01,680
You've got a little tin roof and close
the doors and windows and put all your

290
00:19:01,681 --> 00:19:05,310
robes on. And if you're going to be angry,
do it right. Sit in the middle of that,

291
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,181
you know,

292
00:19:06,181 --> 00:19:09,770
and sit in the middle of the fire and
don't be so afraid of it because you're

293
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:13,200
afraid of it. You're just going to keep
stuffing it. And on the other hand,

294
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:17,010
or if you're afraid of it,
it'll just explode. There's
another way to be with it.

295
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,310
Um, and so that was the
beginning of some healing,

296
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:24,800
just to realize that I could
actually tolerate the suffering. Um,

297
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:30,140
and the energy that was in my still
carried from trauma in my body and heart.

298
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:35,010
So we're going to absolutely come
back to [inaudible] cause I have many

299
00:19:35,011 --> 00:19:39,690
questions on that chapter in your life,
but just,

300
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,210
just so that I can create the
proper visual in my own head.

301
00:19:42,211 --> 00:19:46,560
So you sat there in your hut in the
sweltering heat with all of your robes on

302
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,040
when you were,
were you angry in silence?

303
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:54,700
Well, I was pretty much angry in silence.
And that's an interesting question.

304
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,450
Yeah. I, you know, in the
monastery, the culture was not,

305
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:00,340
was not much that you would yell,

306
00:20:00,341 --> 00:20:03,580
you could go somewhere out in
the forest and yell, but it was,

307
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:08,020
it wasn't decorous or something. People
are with the Hell's wrong with that monk.

308
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,440
Um, so mostly, uh,

309
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:15,250
I was sitting in silence and then scenes
would come. Then I would realize, wow,

310
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:19,150
you know, I thought I was
peaceful. I carry every,

311
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:24,110
in every cell of my body.
I also carry both the pain and anger,

312
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,370
my childhood and my father,
and just the,

313
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:29,770
the anger that comes with being a
human being and human incarnation.

314
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:34,450
And I was never going to have that,
but of course there it was. Um,

315
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:39,580
and it lasted, you know, this was,
I had days of and, and actually,

316
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,910
um,
much longer weeks or months of waves of,

317
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,150
of this coming and learning how to,
you know,

318
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,700
be present it and not
get overwhelmed by it.

319
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:54,230
So I want to backtrack and
then connect those dots.

320
00:20:54,231 --> 00:20:59,231
So between childhood and
ending up in Thailand,

321
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:03,440
you mentioned Dartmouth earlier
and from what I've read,

322
00:21:03,441 --> 00:21:07,490
at least you were initially premed
and then ended up Asian Studies.

323
00:21:07,491 --> 00:21:12,491
Could you describe that experience in
Dartmouth or how you went from premed to

324
00:21:14,421 --> 00:21:15,254
Asian Studies?

325
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,421
Well,
you know,

326
00:21:16,421 --> 00:21:21,280
we all get turned in these
mysterious ways in our life.

327
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:26,580
We think we're going one direction and
then something happens unexpectedly and a

328
00:21:27,971 --> 00:21:29,350
gateway opens.

329
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:34,380
So I was coming from an organic chemistry
class to the class that I'd signed up

330
00:21:36,191 --> 00:21:40,280
for out of interest on Asian Studies,
uh,

331
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:42,100
raise in philosophy or something.

332
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:45,760
And it was an old professor
and doctor winks it.

333
00:21:45,761 --> 00:21:48,100
Chan who would come up from Harvard.

334
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,730
He was kind of emeritus there.
Um,

335
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,320
and he even said cross-legged,
sometimes, you know,

336
00:21:56,321 --> 00:22:01,210
in the front of the room and would
talk about loud too. And that was him.

337
00:22:01,211 --> 00:22:06,211
And they talk about Buddhist teachings
and how the Buddha taught suffering and

338
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:13,580
its causes and its end.
And that really all of a sudden I sat up,

339
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,780
I said, there's an end of suffering,
there's a way to do. And he said, oh,

340
00:22:16,781 --> 00:22:20,920
there's all these teachings and practices
where you can transform your heart and

341
00:22:20,921 --> 00:22:21,730
mind.

342
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:26,680
And I became thrilled about it and realize
that whatever impulse I had to go to

343
00:22:26,681 --> 00:22:28,420
medical school,
um,

344
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:32,680
probably part of it came from
wanting to heal myself. Um,

345
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:35,710
and so I started taking more and
more courses and then it was,

346
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:39,880
it was the 60 [inaudible] and I
became a card carrying hippie.

347
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,850
I'm a card carrying LSD,

348
00:22:42,851 --> 00:22:47,010
taking hippie as a matter of fact.
And um,

349
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:51,820
Eh, at the end of, in, yeah,

350
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:55,420
when I was getting ready to graduate,
there was still the draft and I thought,

351
00:22:55,421 --> 00:22:59,140
well I'm definitely know we want to go
over and kill people in a war that I,

352
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,760
that I've been protesting
it protesting against. Um,

353
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:07,360
so I decided to go into the Peace Corps
instead and ask them to send me to a

354
00:23:07,361 --> 00:23:09,790
Buddhist country where
maybe I could find it.

355
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:13,630
One of those old Zen masters
that you read about, um,

356
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:17,800
and got assigned to Thailand.
Um, and when I got there,

357
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,053
um,

358
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:25,180
people you could kind of request
where you went, they, and, and I said,

359
00:23:25,181 --> 00:23:28,720
send me to the most remote place you can.
I wanted adventure.

360
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:32,170
But I also wanted to kind of
reading all those old zen stories.

361
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:37,180
I wanted to see if that,
that still existed. So, um,

362
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:38,801
you know,

363
00:23:38,801 --> 00:23:42,430
and there were little detours like being
in Haight Ashbury in the summer of love

364
00:23:42,431 --> 00:23:47,150
and things like that,
that definitely, um, they,

365
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:50,820
it changed my life also
in a very deep way, um,

366
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:53,360
because for at least for a time,

367
00:23:53,361 --> 00:23:56,450
there was a window when people
were just giving things away.

368
00:23:56,451 --> 00:24:00,380
There was such a sense that the
world could be transformed. Um,

369
00:24:00,381 --> 00:24:04,520
some of it as we know, very, very
naive. One in the other hand,

370
00:24:04,521 --> 00:24:09,521
it also felt like a greater sense of
brotherhood and sisterhood than I had ever

371
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:12,730
known. Um, um,

372
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:15,830
except with my own brothers who I love
a lot and we've done a lot of things

373
00:24:15,831 --> 00:24:20,480
together and I started to feel like
there are other ways for me and for the

374
00:24:20,481 --> 00:24:25,010
world to be and live. Um, and
that was, that was also very,

375
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,420
um,
wonderful.

376
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,540
You mentioned,

377
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:31,450
you mentioned a three letter acronym that
we're probably not going to spend too,

378
00:24:31,451 --> 00:24:34,690
too much time on, but I, I, you and I,

379
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:39,400
you and I have had quite a number of
conversations where I've wanted to ask you

380
00:24:39,401 --> 00:24:43,870
about some of your experiences,
uh, with psychedelics,

381
00:24:43,871 --> 00:24:45,970
including LSD,
but we've never really gotten into it.

382
00:24:45,971 --> 00:24:49,600
So I figure why not do it in front
of a few million people, uh, the,

383
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:53,920
the Lsd at that point,
your experiences with that,

384
00:24:53,921 --> 00:24:58,921
did that inform your decisions at all to
then go into the peace corps and end up

385
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,050
in a remote area?

386
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,121
It did.

387
00:25:03,121 --> 00:25:06,660
And I've written out a little bit about
it and in a couple of different of my

388
00:25:06,661 --> 00:25:11,661
books and chapters in books I've
written because I'm the most,

389
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:19,060
oh, Buddhist teachers and
teachers of my generation, um,

390
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:21,670
also started with academics.
You know,

391
00:25:21,671 --> 00:25:26,200
myself and almost all my
colleagues, um, you know,

392
00:25:26,201 --> 00:25:31,000
in the spiritual industry that I'm in,
um, that was the beginning and for me,

393
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,020
um,

394
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:36,850
it showed an incredible possibility that
all is created out of consciousness.

395
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,000
Um, and the possibilities
of inner freedom and,

396
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:42,670
or basically I was able at the,

397
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:47,620
at the best of it to see
my body and my personality,

398
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:48,730
um,

399
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:53,730
and my history and realized that that's
not who I am to become much more the

400
00:25:54,191 --> 00:25:58,000
conscious witness of it all.
To See yes,

401
00:25:58,001 --> 00:26:02,920
birth and death and to go through
those kind of, um, uh, death,

402
00:26:02,921 --> 00:26:05,000
rebirth experiences that can happen,
um,

403
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,200
at times in a deep session with Lsd or
death of ego or sense of self or removing

404
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:15,670
and realizing, wow, there's
a freedom and a life force.

405
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,350
It's what we're made of.
Um,

406
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:22,620
and that profoundly influenced my interest
in spirituality and also interest in

407
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:28,450
what the world can be. Now.
Um, just a few days ago,

408
00:26:28,451 --> 00:26:30,880
I was on,
um,

409
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,590
loudly with my beloved wife Trudy.
Um,

410
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:37,480
and we were visiting
spending time with Ron Doss,

411
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,150
who for listeners that don't know,

412
00:26:40,151 --> 00:26:44,970
was I'm the author of this bestseller
in the 60s called be here now and now,

413
00:26:44,971 --> 00:26:49,520
easy 86 and in a wheelchair.
Um, but Ron Doss,

414
00:26:49,521 --> 00:26:53,850
who had been at Harvard University and
was one of the early explorers of LSD

415
00:26:53,851 --> 00:26:57,880
before he went to India and
became a spiritual teacher, um,

416
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:59,653
uh,

417
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:05,190
in the living room while we
were there two days ago. Um,

418
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,150
Roland Fischer,

419
00:27:06,151 --> 00:27:11,151
who is one of the senior professors in
psychopharmacologists at Johns Hopkins

420
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:16,530
University Medical School over rolling,
rolling, rolling, rolling. Griffis rather,

421
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:20,200
and Roland, excuse me, Roland
Griffiths and Roland, um,

422
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:26,360
laid out all the research that's happening
now on the silicide and that he's

423
00:27:27,451 --> 00:27:31,470
been doing and it's success for people,

424
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:35,880
terminal cancer patients,
all of losing a great deal of their,

425
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:39,450
the fears that they had. Um, uh,

426
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:43,970
working with people with
severe depression. Um,

427
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:48,930
and it was a beautiful session because
you could hear how these sacred

428
00:27:48,931 --> 00:27:53,850
substances and these mind altering
substances when they're used in the right

429
00:27:53,851 --> 00:27:58,530
context, can really
transform human beings. Um,

430
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,540
and Nyu Johns Hopkins,

431
00:28:00,541 --> 00:28:04,620
there's a whole series of studies that
are happening now that are finally

432
00:28:04,621 --> 00:28:06,990
bringing it back into the mainstream.

433
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:13,120
So I'd love to underscore just a few
things that you mentioned. Uh, number one,

434
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:16,630
uh, Ron Doss, for those people
who want to do additional reading,

435
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:20,200
formerly known as Richard Alpert,
if I'm getting that right,

436
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:26,070
also has a fascinating story coming
full circle with psychedelic research

437
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:31,780
beginning, I guess at Harvard in some
respects as it makes sense to me,

438
00:28:31,781 --> 00:28:35,920
why Roland's research would
be so meaningful to him. Uh,

439
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:40,420
and a number of other, just,
just quick comments for people.

440
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,640
Number one is if you're interested in,
in looking into these sole Simon,

441
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:47,500
which is,
uh,

442
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:52,800
considered the active psychoactive
ingredient in magic mushrooms,

443
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,500
uh,
at Johns Hopkins and elsewhere,

444
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:01,030
I've actually been involved with
a crowdfunding and funding myself,

445
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:06,020
some of the research related to a
treatment resistant depression, uh,

446
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:10,190
at Johns Hopkins with Roland Griffiths
as the senior investigator. Uh,

447
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,040
and I'll be posting some updates to that.

448
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:14,800
But fascinating work
looking at everything from,

449
00:29:14,801 --> 00:29:16,410
and this is also as you mentioned,

450
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:20,560
Nyu and at other very well
regarded universities,

451
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:23,650
uh,
alcohol addiction,

452
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:27,700
nicotine slash tobacco
addiction as you mentioned, uh,

453
00:29:27,701 --> 00:29:31,990
end of life anxiety in cancer patients.
The implications are,

454
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,710
are really profound and the data very,
very promising.

455
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:40,690
And I wanted to also mention to folks who
are perhaps saying to themselves, well,

456
00:29:40,691 --> 00:29:43,210
I'm interested in taking
cell psychedelics myself,

457
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,000
that there are people I know,

458
00:29:46,001 --> 00:29:49,900
good friends of mine who do
not currently use psychedelics,

459
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:53,350
but had the ego dissolving,

460
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:59,090
a experience of a non ordinary reality
through psychedelics that then led them

461
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:03,730
to become, uh, or contributed to
them becoming very, very delicate,

462
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:07,240
diligent meditators.
S and, uh, Sam Harris,

463
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,240
who's a phd in neuroscience,
uh,

464
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:14,310
and thought of are very well
known as a and an atheist.

465
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:15,491
Uh,
or you know,

466
00:30:15,491 --> 00:30:20,491
one of the four horsemen of the atheist
apocalypse along with Richard Dawkins

467
00:30:20,741 --> 00:30:25,480
and others, uh, is a very close friend
and extremely diligent meditator.

468
00:30:25,481 --> 00:30:28,990
And He's, he's written about
how his psychedelic experiences,

469
00:30:28,991 --> 00:30:30,820
which were in some respects very,

470
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,780
some of them uncontrolled and you
really have a coin flip there. Uh,

471
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,640
it's in terms of which
direction you can go,

472
00:30:36,641 --> 00:30:41,641
but showed him possibilities within
his own mind that then led to a very,

473
00:30:42,521 --> 00:30:44,860
very, uh, I'm not going to call it devout,

474
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:49,240
although I should just a
bathroom diligent practice.

475
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:52,240
So I don't want to take
us too far off the rails,

476
00:30:52,241 --> 00:30:55,840
but you go to Southeast Asia.

477
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,790
Oh, sure. We move on because
we are talking about this.

478
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:04,940
It turns out for those who were listening,

479
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,810
that set and setting an intention
are extremely important.

480
00:31:08,811 --> 00:31:13,811
If one uses these psychedelics
like psilocybin or something
to set the intention

481
00:31:14,751 --> 00:31:19,550
to learn, to open, to have a quiet,
it's not, not as a party experience,

482
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:22,160
absolutely makes,
you know,

483
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:28,250
brings your attention inward.
And then all the kinds of discoveries,

484
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,353
um,

485
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:34,360
become right in front of
your right in front of you.

486
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,351
Um,
the,

487
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:40,351
but the other thing is that whether it's
right for somebody to use psychedelics

488
00:31:40,791 --> 00:31:44,280
or do you use meditation,
these are all, uh,

489
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:49,400
invitations to step back and
see the mystery of your life.

490
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,670
Because we tend to live in the,
you know,

491
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:58,510
daily Minutia and checking off our
list of tasks that we have to do and

492
00:31:58,701 --> 00:32:01,040
completing them by work or,
or you know,

493
00:32:01,041 --> 00:32:05,900
or eating or all the kind of things
that make up a day and we go on to

494
00:32:05,901 --> 00:32:07,640
automatic.
Um,

495
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:12,290
and whether it's meditation and difference
or other spiritual disciplines or for

496
00:32:12,291 --> 00:32:17,291
some people it also can just be that
they have what in Greek is called a Kata

497
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:22,400
Bossam below, you know, somebody
close to them gets cancer or,

498
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:27,470
or is dying or they have some accident
or something and all of a sudden you sit

499
00:32:27,471 --> 00:32:31,280
back and you realize, whoa, life is an
uncertain the way I've been taking it.

500
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:36,360
It's not just checking off the list and
this is a mystery human incarnation and

501
00:32:37,251 --> 00:32:40,940
what am I going to do with it? And Wow
at this, how did I get in this body?

502
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:44,510
Look at plants and trees. And, and, um,

503
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:49,370
language that air coming out of your
mouth that you shape it different ways in

504
00:32:49,371 --> 00:32:51,800
it vibrates a little drum
and the ear of someone else.

505
00:32:51,801 --> 00:32:54,500
And I can say Golden Gate
Bridge and they can envision it.

506
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:58,490
And you start to realize that all of
it is alive and made of consciousness.

507
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:03,790
And then the whole sense of who you
are and what matters begins to shift.

508
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:09,320
And you start to realize that life is
not just getting through the hoops,

509
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:14,740
but it actually also can be a celebration
of the heart of something that you

510
00:33:15,561 --> 00:33:20,400
have to bring to the world that you come
out of life. And my friend melanoma.

511
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:24,470
So Mary, who's a west African
Shaman and medicine man,

512
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:28,490
also two PhDs are kind of remarkable guy.
Um,

513
00:33:28,491 --> 00:33:33,491
he says with the dog or up people in
West Africa that he's from that um,

514
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:37,720
they say that every child
comes into the world, uh,

515
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,800
with a certain cargo.

516
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:44,890
Is there a metaphor like the cargo ships
that ply the rivers of West Africa and

517
00:33:45,351 --> 00:33:46,010
that,

518
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:51,010
that they're given gifts to bring into
the world and that we have gifts to bring

519
00:33:53,301 --> 00:33:55,910
to this mystery which
include opening to it.

520
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,580
And as we do love grows,

521
00:33:58,581 --> 00:34:03,581
connection grows and in a whole different
way of being in the world happens that

522
00:34:03,591 --> 00:34:06,740
we need, um, so much at this time.

523
00:34:06,741 --> 00:34:11,690
So that's a little interlude there.
Before we move on to the net,

524
00:34:11,691 --> 00:34:12,520
your next question,

525
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:17,520
I welcome as many interludes as you would
like to interject and I wanted to just

526
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:20,140
ask you to say one more time that it was,

527
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:24,280
I believe Greek word for caught them off,
which means a blow.

528
00:34:24,281 --> 00:34:28,030
It's like something comes and it just
sets your life spinning an entirely

529
00:34:28,031 --> 00:34:31,750
different direction. Right? Like a
catalyzing event and that the, exactly,

530
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:35,350
I've had a few of those recently that I'd
like to selfishly ask you about later,

531
00:34:35,351 --> 00:34:40,120
but I can bookmark just so
I can bookmark this name,

532
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:44,200
uh, s uh, Stanislav Grof if
I'm saying that correctly.

533
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:48,310
That's correct.
When just when did you meet him?

534
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:50,590
Roughly what age or what date,

535
00:34:50,591 --> 00:34:53,530
just so I can come back to it because
this is another thing I've been meaning to

536
00:34:53,531 --> 00:34:56,350
ask you about for a long time and get
into. But I haven't had the chance.

537
00:34:57,110 --> 00:35:01,290
So I had, there's two things to say. Um,

538
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:05,780
when I came back from the
monastery and now it's,

539
00:35:05,781 --> 00:35:10,730
you know, I guess the year that I
connect with Stan was maybe 1973.

540
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:12,910
I made two really important connections,
right.

541
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,360
And came back and start

542
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:19,590
eight psychology in graduate
school. Um, I was in Boston. Um,

543
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:24,350
and first really important connection
happened when I went to a meeting of the

544
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:28,160
Massachusetts Psychological Association.

545
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:32,710
And there was this guy who looked like he,

546
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:36,860
he didn't look just like the straight
psychologists and it turned out he'd just

547
00:35:36,861 --> 00:35:41,790
come back from India not long before
named Dan Goleman, who was it,

548
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:45,750
who was a graduate student at Harvard
and he had projected on the screen this

549
00:35:45,751 --> 00:35:50,751
Tibetans wheel of birth and death that
you see in the Tibetan Tonka is that that

550
00:35:52,411 --> 00:35:56,400
normally would be taken as
some kind of affirmative, um,

551
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:01,510
icon, iconic, uh, you know,
symbol. And he said, no,

552
00:36:01,511 --> 00:36:03,510
no,
this is a psychological diagram.

553
00:36:03,511 --> 00:36:07,080
The Buddha was actually
more than anything else. Um,

554
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:11,650
he was a scientist of the mind and a us,

555
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,470
a profound psychologists.

556
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:17,370
And here is how craving
turns into contentment,

557
00:36:17,371 --> 00:36:22,371
and here's how aggression can be
transformed into powerful energy to heal

558
00:36:22,801 --> 00:36:24,000
yourself and others.

559
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:27,780
And he were going through this diagram
and I went and I talked to him and he

560
00:36:27,781 --> 00:36:32,470
said, Oh, you, you come back from
monastery, you've got to come over. Um,

561
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:35,370
and so he took me to David Mcclellan,

562
00:36:35,371 --> 00:36:40,371
who had been the chairman of the social
science and Psychology Department at

563
00:36:40,591 --> 00:36:44,940
Harvard at that time,
the one who hired Tim leary and Ram Das.

564
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:48,880
And then later had to fire
them for their LSD work. Um,

565
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:52,920
and his house, he and his
wife Mary, were Quakers.

566
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:56,940
His home was a kind of soiree,
um,

567
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:02,120
where Ron doss and Tibetan lamas like
Chogyam Trungpa and I think Krishna Murti

568
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:06,160
and various spiritual figures would come.
Um,

569
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:09,800
people were going to MBN
coming back. Um, and, and, um,

570
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:15,110
I connected with this whole group of
folks who have now been friends for 45

571
00:37:15,361 --> 00:37:19,590
years. Um, Richie Davidson
was another that I met there,

572
00:37:19,591 --> 00:37:24,270
who's now one of the preeminent
neuroscientists in the world on studying

573
00:37:24,271 --> 00:37:28,530
contemplative neuroscience and an
affective emotional neuroscience.

574
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:30,660
It was a whole collective of people,

575
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:35,690
Dan Goleman who wrote
emotional intelligence that
sold 10 million copies and

576
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:41,170
many others.
And then I got a job working for a,

577
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:45,660
an Esselyn like growth center in Boston
at that time cause I was excited at all

578
00:37:45,661 --> 00:37:50,250
the new gestalt bioenergetics what are
the things that are transformative here.

579
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:54,210
Um, and they asked me to help set
up programs and I thought, well,

580
00:37:54,211 --> 00:37:56,850
who do I want to,
who do I want to meet?

581
00:37:56,851 --> 00:38:01,851
So I set up a program with John Lilly
and I set up a program with Stan Grof who

582
00:38:02,341 --> 00:38:07,050
was still at Johns Hopkins and married
at that time just married to Joan,

583
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:11,000
Halifax, Joan Groff. And we
became friends. And so we've,

584
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:15,330
Stan and I have now worked
together for 45 years.

585
00:38:15,331 --> 00:38:19,590
I went out to join him at SLN for many,
many years,

586
00:38:19,591 --> 00:38:21,180
spending many months together,

587
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:24,930
helping during his development of the
holotropic breath work that's at this

588
00:38:24,931 --> 00:38:28,560
powerful breath transformation. And, um,

589
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:31,590
he has been a partner and a,

590
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:35,950
and a in a heart friend for exploration.

591
00:38:35,951 --> 00:38:40,150
And we've traveled where we've
taught in Russia and in, you know,

592
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:44,560
places in Europe and various
places around the world.

593
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:47,230
So this is,

594
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:52,440
this is definitely a path that we're
going to come down and dig further into,

595
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:58,600
but I, I'm going to steer us to, uh,

596
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,800
[inaudible] I want to know how do you
land with the Peace Corps in ever more

597
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:04,961
remote?
Well,

598
00:39:04,961 --> 00:39:08,440
what most people would consider a
remote corner of the world and ended up

599
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:13,060
finding a living master. How does
that, how does that actually happen?

600
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:16,300
I don't know. I, but I assume you
didn't speak Thai at the time.

601
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:21,040
I did actually did the Peace Corps.
Right.

602
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,750
And then I had to learn Lao.

603
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:26,260
I did because the Peace
Corps at that time,

604
00:39:26,261 --> 00:39:29,890
it was a very early in the peace corps
had really good language training.

605
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:34,050
They borrowed it from the Monterey
Language Institute. So, you know,

606
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:36,880
initially I didn't speak that well,
but um,

607
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:41,770
because I'd also studied Chinese
at Dartmouth, he came more easily.

608
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:45,150
Um, and I was there working in these, um,

609
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,290
in the health rural health department,
on tropical medicine teams,

610
00:39:50,291 --> 00:39:51,580
mostly malaria,

611
00:39:51,581 --> 00:39:56,380
but also typhoid and teams going up
to different villages and taking,

612
00:39:56,381 --> 00:40:00,490
drawing blood and um,
giving out medicine and things like that.

613
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:02,730
And then somebody said,
there's a,

614
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:06,240
there's a western bank in this
province we heard about, um,

615
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:08,560
do you want to meet her? I
said, of course I do. So I,

616
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:13,920
I went to this little mountain and
walked up to thousand steps to the old

617
00:40:15,521 --> 00:40:19,840
Cambodian temple, ruined at the top.
And there was this very interesting guy,

618
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:21,053
um,

619
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:25,780
who had just finished a couple of
years before the first peace corps,

620
00:40:25,781 --> 00:40:26,890
I think in Borneo.

621
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:30,850
And then got interested in Buddhism
and common ordained as a monk.

622
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:35,990
And I talk with him. He's now, he's
named Dot Johnson. Tomato is, is, um,

623
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:37,830
amongst name cause he's still a monk.

624
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:42,840
And he became quite famous and Thailand
and then became the abbot of a temple

625
00:40:43,731 --> 00:40:45,620
in, in England. Um,

626
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:50,470
and I became friends with
him and he said, oh, I found,

627
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,320
I found a really fine teacher.
He said, you know, a lot of them,

628
00:40:53,321 --> 00:40:56,200
they kind of take you, you're a Westerner
and they treat you special. He said,

629
00:40:56,201 --> 00:41:00,520
this guy doesn't treat you any
differently than anyone else.

630
00:41:00,521 --> 00:41:04,720
He just wants you to do that work,
you know, and learn that, learn,

631
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:10,150
learn the deepest way you can.
And he's in this forest jungle.

632
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,840
And I said, I'm going
there. So having heard that,

633
00:41:13,841 --> 00:41:18,841
I went and I visited a Jen Cha and he
was a little bit like the Dalai Lama.

634
00:41:18,941 --> 00:41:22,520
He was funny and wise
and very warmhearted,

635
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:26,110
but also very strict and very demanding.

636
00:41:26,111 --> 00:41:30,640
But he did it in this loving way. Um, and
I thought, okay, this is the real deal.

637
00:41:30,641 --> 00:41:35,210
This guy looks like, uh, like what was
reading about and all those in stories.

638
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:40,790
So I,
I read that he said to you,

639
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:44,420
and I'd love for you to tell
us when he said this to you,

640
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:49,160
I hope you're not afraid to
suffer. Uh, if that's true.

641
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:52,010
When did he say that in?
Why did he say that?

642
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,310
Hey,
I,

643
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:57,830
so I visited him a number of times and
told him I was going to become a monk and

644
00:41:57,831 --> 00:42:02,510
then I ordained in the village where
I was living in the peace corps.

645
00:42:02,511 --> 00:42:04,940
People wanted me to do that.
It was a beautiful ritual.

646
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:08,560
And then after some days,
um,

647
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:12,350
made my way down to his
temple and he said, that's,

648
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:16,880
that was his opening gambit. I'm walking
in and did the gate and I see him,

649
00:42:16,881 --> 00:42:21,710
I vow as I'm here and he looks at me,
you know,

650
00:42:21,711 --> 00:42:25,850
kind of leans back a little, a
little skeptical. He said, all right,

651
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:29,900
I hope you're not afraid to suffer.
Welcome. And it was, it was, uh,

652
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:35,450
it was like, you know, you didn't come
here just to kind of do some interesting,

653
00:42:35,451 --> 00:42:40,190
cool anthropological experiment
or something like that.
If you're going to do it,

654
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:45,170
we're going to put you
through the training. Um,
and, and, and he did, but he,

655
00:42:45,171 --> 00:42:48,680
you know, there was like this little
smile as he said it. Like, okay,

656
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:52,040
you are you up for it? All
right, dude. Come on in.

657
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:57,630
Well, and what did, what did the
training consist consist of? What were,

658
00:42:57,631 --> 00:43:00,460
what were some of the first things
that you had to do and then what,

659
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,500
what was the suffering that he alluded to?
What were some of,

660
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:08,010
well, that'd be some examples.
Um, okay. So of course the,

661
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:12,150
the first training was just how to walk
around and not have my robe, you know,

662
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:15,190
fall on the ground and embarrass me
and everyone, a hose that comes to,

663
00:43:15,191 --> 00:43:17,840
they all loved it. Oh yeah. All
right. Look at the western. He's,

664
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:22,320
he can't even wear his
robes, right. Or whatever.

665
00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:27,060
So part of it was just the unfamiliarity
of it culturally and otherwise.

666
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:30,990
Um, uh, there were the,

667
00:43:30,991 --> 00:43:34,560
there were the two kinds of suffering.
The big suffering of course,

668
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:39,300
was being alone with my own mind.
I mean, there you go, you know,

669
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:42,770
having to do hours of meditation,
um,

670
00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:45,720
when I didn't know what
the hell I was doing. Um,

671
00:43:46,050 --> 00:43:50,760
and then as I talked about with anger
or fear or confusion or, you know,

672
00:43:50,761 --> 00:43:52,860
all those kinds of states,
um,

673
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:57,060
learning to deal in a very
conscious and mindful way.

674
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:00,480
And then more importantly
in a compassionate way,

675
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:05,630
in a kind and loving way with all the
energies that make up my humanity and our

676
00:44:06,631 --> 00:44:10,500
humanity. Um, and that means that
when you sit and you get quiet,

677
00:44:10,770 --> 00:44:15,060
anything unfinished in your heart will
also come up all the unfinished business.

678
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:18,240
So, you know, um,

679
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:23,340
relationships that I'd had that
ended badly in college or, or,

680
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:23,910
um,

681
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:28,740
certainly stuff from my childhood
and family dreams that I carried,

682
00:44:28,741 --> 00:44:33,510
things will fill the, not all
of that up. It's, um, yeah,

683
00:44:33,511 --> 00:44:37,140
my friend Danny,
the mot humorist and writer says,

684
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:40,650
my mind is like a bad neighborhood.
I try not to go there alone.

685
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:45,060
And there's some way in
which, um, in community,

686
00:44:45,061 --> 00:44:48,750
sitting together with others in
meditation and then sitting in my hot, um,

687
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:53,790
it was really facing myself and
my full humanity. That was the,

688
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,560
that was probably the most difficult
thing because then you get insanely bored,

689
00:44:58,561 --> 00:45:02,250
are insanely restless or, and then how
do you deal with all those energies?

690
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:06,450
Normally what we're restless or bored,
you know, what do we do? We, you know,

691
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:09,160
um,
open the refrigerator or you know,

692
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:14,180
go online or something because we can't
be with our own loneliness or fear.

693
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:17,340
Um,
so those are the inner,

694
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:22,350
and then there's the outer with bordering
the outer one or ones were things

695
00:45:22,351 --> 00:45:26,010
like, uh, getting up.

696
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:31,160
The bell would ring at three 30 in the
morning and I'm not an early riser by

697
00:45:31,531 --> 00:45:34,440
nature. I go, Oh God, here
we go. And we walked through.

698
00:45:34,441 --> 00:45:38,520
It was actually very beautiful. Then
we'd walk through the forest at night,

699
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:43,530
either by moonlight or sometimes you'd
have a tiny little flashlight. Um,

700
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:47,610
and one of the forest monasteries
where there were a lot of cobras,

701
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:52,200
we'd have a little stick and you'd tap
the path so that the snakes would know

702
00:45:52,201 --> 00:45:56,830
you would feel you coming and move out
of the way. We wouldn't step on them. Um,

703
00:45:57,390 --> 00:46:02,280
and then we would sit silently for a
couple of hours and then do an hour of

704
00:46:02,281 --> 00:46:05,580
chanting on a hard stone
floor. Mind you, when we,

705
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:09,210
everybody else seemed comfortable
in my body was killing me. Um,

706
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:14,610
and then at least once a week we would
sit up all night with the teacher and he

707
00:46:14,611 --> 00:46:17,220
would sit there comfortably meditating,

708
00:46:17,221 --> 00:46:21,300
maybe talking with another colleague that
it would come and we'd just be sitting

709
00:46:21,301 --> 00:46:25,190
and meditating and he would kind of peak
over at us. Like, how are you doing? I go,

710
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,510
God, it's been four hours. When are we,

711
00:46:27,511 --> 00:46:30,960
when is he going to let us go back
to sleep? And he didn't, you know,

712
00:46:30,961 --> 00:46:33,600
so sitting up all night,
um,

713
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:37,100
it got very cold in the cold season,
um,

714
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:41,130
and it got insanely hot and hot season.
Um,

715
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:46,430
and somehow learning to live extremely
simply where the set of sandals and a set

716
00:46:48,811 --> 00:46:53,610
of robes and an alms bowl and then you
would eat what you got offered in the

717
00:46:53,611 --> 00:46:58,290
village. And we would share it in
that monastery with others around us.

718
00:46:58,650 --> 00:46:59,370
Um,

719
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:04,370
and sometimes you'd get nice food and a
lot of times in the dry season you get

720
00:47:04,921 --> 00:47:09,850
really, really skimpy food and
there wasn't that much to eat. Um,

721
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:14,490
and so picture a day where you get up
at three 30 in the morning, you know,

722
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:15,750
um,

723
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:20,610
you sit for a couple of hours in
meditation and do long than an hour long

724
00:47:20,611 --> 00:47:25,200
chanting on a stone floor. Then it's
getting dawn and you walk barefoot,

725
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:26,880
you know, three miles, five miles,

726
00:47:26,881 --> 00:47:31,390
10 miles with the alms bowl and a handful
of other monks and get your food and

727
00:47:31,391 --> 00:47:35,830
come back, whatever you've been offered
in. That's the food for the day. Um,

728
00:47:36,070 --> 00:47:40,780
and then you go back to your meditation
or to the work of the monastery of

729
00:47:40,781 --> 00:47:45,340
sewing robes or drawing water
from the well, um, and it's,

730
00:47:45,370 --> 00:47:50,260
you know,
McGee and 105 degrees hot season.

731
00:47:50,590 --> 00:47:53,380
Um,
and uh,

732
00:47:53,650 --> 00:47:57,940
then you go back and you join in the
community for more meditation and then the

733
00:47:57,941 --> 00:48:01,220
teacher smiles and say, how
are you doing? You know? Um,

734
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:05,740
and then other kinds of practices. For
example, we had a charnel ground there.

735
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:10,120
And so I've charnel ground,

736
00:48:10,121 --> 00:48:15,010
which is where a cremation ground
where people bodies would be burned.

737
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:20,460
And so on occasion would go to a
cremation and then sit up all night.

738
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:26,680
And contemplate death, um, and you know,

739
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:31,740
look at the body and then watches it
burned and then do these meditations where

740
00:48:31,781 --> 00:48:33,010
you would reflect on,
well,

741
00:48:33,011 --> 00:48:35,710
this is going to happen to the body
that you're inhabiting as well.

742
00:48:35,711 --> 00:48:39,400
Who Do you think you are? Do you think
you're this physical body made of,

743
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:44,200
you know, hamburgers or lettuce
or whatever you happen to eat?

744
00:48:44,201 --> 00:48:48,450
Is that, are you hamburgers
and let us, you know, or Oh,

745
00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:51,940
where are you?
Your feelings or your thoughts?

746
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:56,060
Who are he really born into this body?
Um,

747
00:48:56,140 --> 00:49:00,050
like Koans. Um, so anyway,

748
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:03,890
and the alms bowls.
So you'd be,

749
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:09,850
did you eat whatever you gathered in
one meal? Was it spread throughout

750
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:12,250
one meal?
You eat one meal a day,

751
00:49:12,251 --> 00:49:16,320
which makes you very easy
to make your life easy. Um,

752
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:19,690
and at the same at that monastery,
things were shared.

753
00:49:19,691 --> 00:49:23,290
There was other monasteries I stayed in
where you would just eat what was put in

754
00:49:23,291 --> 00:49:26,820
your own bowl. Um, uh, and, um,

755
00:49:26,890 --> 00:49:29,590
you didn't have to eat
everything that was given to you.

756
00:49:29,591 --> 00:49:31,780
There were some things that were,
you know,

757
00:49:31,781 --> 00:49:36,781
in the dry poor season there would be
Curry's that were too hot for me to eat

758
00:49:38,771 --> 00:49:43,420
cause they use the chili's to
kind of um, preserve, preserve,

759
00:49:43,421 --> 00:49:45,700
preserve the food. But you know, when,

760
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,490
when it was a really poor
village or something, you know,

761
00:49:48,491 --> 00:49:50,770
they would have to make curries out of um,

762
00:49:51,610 --> 00:49:55,840
field bias or field new apps
or bat or bats or, you know,

763
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:58,200
I remember eating, there was a, um,

764
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:03,780
curry that was made out of basically
the grasshoppers that had come scrap

765
00:50:04,961 --> 00:50:09,190
through and there was this whole
big, you know, insect wave of

766
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:16,000
insects that were kind of eating the
crops and they, they collected them all,

767
00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:20,590
made curry out of it. So, you know, okay,
this is what you get for your food today,

768
00:50:20,591 --> 00:50:25,420
dude. I think I might take
the grasshoppers over the,
over the bats I, but yeah.

769
00:50:25,421 --> 00:50:30,020
Well yeah, but when it's highly spice, you
can't tell what is mystery. That's true.

770
00:50:30,021 --> 00:50:32,630
We all had mystery meat and middle school.
Anyway,

771
00:50:32,631 --> 00:50:37,100
this was like mystery meat on steroids,
exotic mystery mean.

772
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:38,480
What was the,

773
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:42,320
what was the longest period of time that
you spent in silence during that time

774
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:43,490
in Thailand?
Well,

775
00:50:43,491 --> 00:50:48,491
then I went to a Burmese monastery
because I wanted to do this very intense

776
00:50:48,591 --> 00:50:52,310
meditative training and
I spent about 500 days,

777
00:50:52,311 --> 00:50:55,730
so less,
less than a year and a half in silence.

778
00:50:56,090 --> 00:51:01,040
That with the exception that I
would talk to the teacher, um, uh,

779
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:04,670
every couple of days I'd have a little
10 minute conversation about what was

780
00:51:04,671 --> 00:51:07,040
happening in my meditation and the rest.

781
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:12,340
I was just sitting and walking
18 hours a day when I could or,

782
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:16,670
or so sleeping a little
bit. Um, and I remember

783
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:22,910
at one point, uh, it
was relatively early on,

784
00:51:22,911 --> 00:51:27,620
I've been sitting and walking and, and
pushing it as young men. Do, you know,

785
00:51:27,621 --> 00:51:31,600
I'm going to get enlightened
and all of that and not moving,

786
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:33,020
sitting with a lot of pain,

787
00:51:33,410 --> 00:51:37,430
which is also part of what happened that
at the forest monasteries sitting on a

788
00:51:37,431 --> 00:51:41,360
stone floor for hours without moving.
Um,

789
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:44,300
he really had to learn how to
deal with your own physical pain.

790
00:51:44,870 --> 00:51:49,870
And I was exhausted from sitting and
walking in my little hot that I had for

791
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:56,390
that long retreat. And after a couple
of months I thought, I'm really tired.

792
00:51:56,391 --> 00:51:59,330
I got to lie down. But
then I thought, well,

793
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:01,710
but I'm not going to nap
for a very long cause I'm,

794
00:52:02,270 --> 00:52:06,860
I'm on my way to enlightenment,
whatever. Um, I'm going to
do this. Right. So I said,

795
00:52:06,861 --> 00:52:07,101
all right,

796
00:52:07,101 --> 00:52:11,930
I'll lie down on the wooden floor rather
than on the little map that I had and

797
00:52:11,931 --> 00:52:16,410
that way it won't sleep so
long and I'm lying there. Um,

798
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:22,360
and then I wake up and I get up and I
walked very slowly doing this mindful slow

799
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:29,260
walking to the end of the hot and look
out the window toward where some of the

800
00:52:29,721 --> 00:52:32,900
other monks in the teachers live in some,
some way down,

801
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,750
some way down through the trees.
Um,

802
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:40,310
and then I turned around and I start
walking the other direction in this,

803
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,860
this meditation hut that I had.

804
00:52:42,861 --> 00:52:47,150
Then you could walk probably
it was maybe 15, 18 feet long.

805
00:52:47,151 --> 00:52:48,530
It was long and Arrow.

806
00:52:49,190 --> 00:52:54,190
And I see this body lying on the
floor and all of a sudden I go,

807
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:57,230
oh,
that's me.

808
00:52:57,770 --> 00:53:01,310
And then I realized that I'm
having out of body experience.

809
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:05,660
And what had happened is that I was so
intent, I'm not going to sleep long.

810
00:53:05,661 --> 00:53:08,510
I'll get up very soon.
That intention was really strong,

811
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:12,630
but my body didn't want to get
up. So I got up, but it was,

812
00:53:12,770 --> 00:53:14,060
it wasn't in my body.

813
00:53:14,330 --> 00:53:17,930
And I've walked very slowly and I peered
down at my body and I turned around and

814
00:53:17,931 --> 00:53:21,800
walked the other way and walk back.
And then the second time I walked back,

815
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:26,790
I got closer and then I fell into my
body and I woke up. I said, Oh wow,

816
00:53:26,791 --> 00:53:29,490
that's interesting.
But what I saw out the window,

817
00:53:29,491 --> 00:53:33,240
it wasn't just like a dream
because I was watching, you know,

818
00:53:33,241 --> 00:53:36,930
my teacher and talking to these
other monks. And then I got up again.

819
00:53:36,931 --> 00:53:38,520
And that's exactly what was happening.

820
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:43,890
And that was the first of a series of
all kinds of very interesting experiences

821
00:53:43,891 --> 00:53:45,720
that happen.
And those

822
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:52,680
other examples of those
types of unusual experiences.

823
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:53,850
B and D,

824
00:53:53,910 --> 00:53:58,770
Was it your time in Burma that found you
experiencing these for the first time?

825
00:53:59,730 --> 00:54:03,420
Well,
first of all,

826
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:08,310
to first experiences, even though I
had experiment with meditation back in,

827
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:12,610
in a senior, in college and so forth, um,

828
00:54:12,970 --> 00:54:16,950
worry experiences again that
came through psychedelics. Um,

829
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:21,510
and so I was familiar with
all kinds of weird and,

830
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:26,900
and powerful and mysterious or
mystical kind of experiences.

831
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:28,650
Um,
but they,

832
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:33,120
but there's something about learning
how to navigate it without taking a

833
00:54:33,121 --> 00:54:38,121
substance and learning that your own
consciousness is the field that you can,

834
00:54:39,670 --> 00:54:44,670
that you can learn to navigate first
all the personality and emotions and

835
00:54:45,361 --> 00:54:49,080
history and so forth. But then you start
to realize that you're bigger than that.

836
00:54:49,081 --> 00:54:54,060
That who you are is not just your
thoughts and feelings in your mind. Um,

837
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:58,470
and so whether it's out of body experience
or the experience of vastness of

838
00:54:58,471 --> 00:55:00,610
becoming the sky,
um,

839
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:05,660
within which everything arises and passes
or the experience of profound silence,

840
00:55:06,691 --> 00:55:08,580
we're of the void where you enter,

841
00:55:08,970 --> 00:55:13,970
enter a stillness before experience even
arises or the experience of luminosity

842
00:55:16,621 --> 00:55:20,790
where, um, uh, where my body
would dissolve into light, uh,

843
00:55:20,791 --> 00:55:23,790
their time sitting.
As you get concentrated in somebody,

844
00:55:23,791 --> 00:55:28,650
your concentration builds that your whole
body and mind open up. And you know,

845
00:55:28,651 --> 00:55:33,600
first you get the elements,
your body can feel heavy like a stone,

846
00:55:33,601 --> 00:55:37,200
the earth element or can fuel so
light that you have to peak your,

847
00:55:37,201 --> 00:55:40,140
open your eyes and make sure you're
not floating cause it feels like you're

848
00:55:40,141 --> 00:55:43,530
floating in the air or it can be filled
with fire and you feel like you're in

849
00:55:43,531 --> 00:55:47,860
the middle of a raging fire
or can get icy cold, you know,

850
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:51,570
or all kinds of vibrations and
couldn't delete the energies.

851
00:55:51,571 --> 00:55:55,590
And chakras start to open. And sometimes
it's pleasant, sometimes it's not.

852
00:55:55,920 --> 00:56:00,000
You know, as deep energies
start to move through your body,

853
00:56:00,001 --> 00:56:02,310
they also kind of push open.

854
00:56:02,311 --> 00:56:07,311
The places that are held close so that
when your heart starts to open in deep

855
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:11,430
meditation, sometimes it feels
like you're having a heart attack.

856
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:13,740
They've physically
painful because all the,

857
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:18,090
all the things that you've held around
your heart to protect yourself start to

858
00:56:18,110 --> 00:56:22,350
loosen. Or when the energy hits
your throat and it starts to open,

859
00:56:22,590 --> 00:56:24,760
weird was come out,
you know,

860
00:56:24,761 --> 00:56:29,570
and then you get to visions
that come and, uh, you know,

861
00:56:29,990 --> 00:56:31,150
Brow Chakra,

862
00:56:31,450 --> 00:56:36,450
you start to see all kinds of colors
and visions and hear things that all

863
00:56:36,610 --> 00:56:41,380
possibilities of the play of
consciousness can start to open after,

864
00:56:41,710 --> 00:56:43,840
um,
both period of silence,

865
00:56:44,050 --> 00:56:47,350
but also really deeply training
attention and concentration,

866
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:54,070
these experiences just to put
them in or at least part of, uh,

867
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:58,620
what you said in context
for people listening. Uh,

868
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:01,530
there, there were a number
of things you mentioned,

869
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:06,620
but one in particular that opening in the
chest that I experienced in the 10 day

870
00:57:07,921 --> 00:57:12,420
retreat, done it a spirit rock, uh, which,

871
00:57:12,450 --> 00:57:17,270
which for which you are one of the, the
instructors or the lead instructor. Uh,

872
00:57:17,490 --> 00:57:22,290
and I,
it was an incredibly powerful experience.

873
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:26,190
And listening to your description
of some of the feelings.

874
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:32,300
It makes me want to go to the jungle and
spend time doing this type of training.

875
00:57:32,701 --> 00:57:33,534
However,

876
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:37,560
the 10 day retreat as you know from
firsthand observation and interacting with

877
00:57:37,561 --> 00:57:41,220
me was incredibly difficult
for me and terrifying it.

878
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:46,340
A number of points where I felt like I
had crossed a boundary into maybe even

879
00:57:46,771 --> 00:57:51,270
madness where I, I was fearful I
wouldn't be able to return from.

880
00:57:51,990 --> 00:57:56,990
And so I'm curious to know during that
period of time in Thailand and Burma

881
00:57:58,710 --> 00:58:01,740
could be afterwards as well,
but when you were in the,

882
00:58:01,741 --> 00:58:04,590
in the jungle and doing
this very intense work,

883
00:58:05,130 --> 00:58:09,310
were there any particular points when
you wanted to quit to go to go home?

884
00:58:10,190 --> 00:58:12,900
Absolutely. I mean, I remember I,

885
00:58:13,130 --> 00:58:15,500
I got what I think was malaria.

886
00:58:15,501 --> 00:58:19,370
I would have a really high fever and I
was sick as a dog and I'm lying in the

887
00:58:19,371 --> 00:58:22,490
bottom of my little hot there.
Um,

888
00:58:22,910 --> 00:58:27,910
high fever and shivering and Odg and
chalk came to visit me and in allow

889
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:32,600
language and he was,
he was also funny and quite blunt.

890
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:36,290
And the allow language is a
very straightforward kind of,

891
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:41,030
the sentence structures are really simple.
So he looked at me and he said, sick,

892
00:58:41,031 --> 00:58:45,980
Huh? I said, yeah. And he said,
hurts all over. Huh? I said,

893
00:58:45,981 --> 00:58:50,300
it's your just, he said hot and
cold. Yeah. He said, you know,

894
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:54,020
makes you afraid. I nodded. He said, makes
you want to go home and see your mother,

895
00:58:54,021 --> 00:58:58,400
doesn't it? And I'm not there. And then
he looked at me and he said, you know,

896
00:58:58,610 --> 00:59:02,750
this is the jungle fever. This
is malaria. We've all had it. Um,

897
00:59:02,990 --> 00:59:04,550
but now there's some good medicine.

898
00:59:04,551 --> 00:59:08,790
I'll send the medicine monk over and
then a couple of days you'll be fine. Um,

899
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:12,170
um, and then he looked at me and he
said, you could do this. You know,

900
00:59:12,171 --> 00:59:14,030
you can do this.
So I mean,

901
00:59:14,031 --> 00:59:17,930
that was an example of wanting to go
home to my mother. What am I doing?

902
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:22,820
What gets me, what kept going? I mean,
I don't want to interrupt, but psych,

903
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:26,660
what kept you going for,
I'm imagining 500 days of silence.

904
00:59:26,661 --> 00:59:30,920
I could barely handle 10
days. You know, Tim, I mean,

905
00:59:30,950 --> 00:59:32,360
what's kept you going?

906
00:59:32,361 --> 00:59:37,010
What keeps any of us going about things
that we care about? I had somehow,

907
00:59:37,011 --> 00:59:40,940
I don't know, kind of a
wacky, but I think also, um,

908
00:59:41,130 --> 00:59:46,130
important kind of passion to
say I want to understand or I,

909
00:59:46,401 --> 00:59:49,640
I, you know, I've started down this
road and I want to see where it goes.

910
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:54,020
And I think all of us find at a
certain point in our life that there,

911
00:59:54,110 --> 00:59:57,800
or if we're lucky that something really
matters and you've done it in your work

912
00:59:57,801 --> 01:00:01,610
and your travel, you want to
explore what your human capacity is.

913
01:00:02,690 --> 01:00:06,300
And I'd read, read these old
zen stories in this. I said,

914
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:10,130
I want to see if this is true. I want
to find out. And then as I, I started,

915
01:00:10,131 --> 01:00:11,600
things started to happen like that,

916
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:16,490
out of the body experience and
rapture and changes in and openings.

917
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:20,240
Um, and I realized that there's
really something to learn here.

918
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:24,560
But there are a couple of other
things that I want to add to this. Um,

919
01:00:24,770 --> 01:00:29,770
one of them that's the most important
is that it turns out that it wasn't,

920
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:35,960
and it isn't so much about
the actual experiences. So,

921
01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:36,890
ah,
Jen Cha,

922
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:41,920
my teacher talked about how in his album
training for the first eight years in

923
01:00:42,891 --> 01:00:44,570
the jungle,
um,

924
01:00:44,870 --> 01:00:49,820
he had been a very ardent meditator and
had all kinds of insights and dissolving

925
01:00:49,821 --> 01:00:54,480
and somebody in John Experiences
all kinds of, he is a weakened.

926
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:58,450
Yeah.
Or how would you try to found,

927
01:00:58,730 --> 01:01:01,160
somebody has a lot of meanings as a word,

928
01:01:01,161 --> 01:01:06,161
but it can mean profound states of
concentration in which the mind dissolves

929
01:01:06,201 --> 01:01:10,490
into light or into joy or bliss or,
um,

930
01:01:10,790 --> 01:01:14,600
becomes absorbed with anyone
of all kinds of states.

931
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:17,900
So we went to the most
famous teacher of that time,

932
01:01:17,901 --> 01:01:22,090
another odd going on Jenman and told
them not all of these experiences in the

933
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:25,760
master looked back and Vince
said, Cha, you missed the point.

934
01:01:25,761 --> 01:01:28,340
These are just experiences.
You know,

935
01:01:28,341 --> 01:01:31,880
it's like gone to the movies and you
have a romantic comedy and you have a war

936
01:01:31,881 --> 01:01:36,760
movie and you've a documentary,
you know, and uh, you know it.

937
01:01:36,770 --> 01:01:41,160
Disney movies, they're just movies on the
screen. Some pleasants a month. I wasn't.

938
01:01:41,420 --> 01:01:45,380
The only question is
to whom do they happen?

939
01:01:46,190 --> 01:01:49,790
Turn your attention back and ask,

940
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:53,780
look to see who is the witness of these.

941
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:58,780
What is the consciousness that is
knowing these ever changing experiences?

942
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:02,690
This is where your liberation will come.
He said,

943
01:02:02,691 --> 01:02:07,580
become his language.
If I translate it is the one who knows.

944
01:02:07,581 --> 01:02:10,940
Become the knowing rather
than the experiences.

945
01:02:11,150 --> 01:02:15,170
And then you can tolerate anything
and you can respond with love and

946
01:02:15,171 --> 01:02:20,171
understanding because you rest
in the timeless consciousness,

947
01:02:20,431 --> 01:02:21,840
which is your true nature.

948
01:02:22,350 --> 01:02:27,350
So part of what I also learned
in meditation and teach
is that it's not so much

949
01:02:28,231 --> 01:02:31,620
about the experiences, Oh, I want
to have this or that experience,

950
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:36,150
but it's this profound
turning back to ask who am I,

951
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:38,760
what is this consciousness itself?

952
01:02:39,070 --> 01:02:42,030
And that was born into this
body that will leave it.

953
01:02:42,031 --> 01:02:45,060
And we can talk about death
at some point if you want. Um,

954
01:02:45,810 --> 01:02:50,730
what is this mysterious consciousness
itself? Um, so there was that.

955
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:53,220
Um, and then, um,

956
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:59,270
then I also had the opportunity of
being with a few other teachers.

957
01:02:59,790 --> 01:03:01,870
And one of my,
uh,

958
01:03:03,060 --> 01:03:07,490
one of the people that I
was very close to and, um,

959
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:13,280
inspired me profoundly was a Cambodian
monk named Maha goes and under who was

960
01:03:14,731 --> 01:03:17,760
the Gandhi of Cambodia.
And what I met him,

961
01:03:17,761 --> 01:03:21,180
we were living in training together
in a forest monastery in Thailand.

962
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:25,660
And it was during the time the
Khmer Rouge came to power and,

963
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:30,510
and eventually killed 2 million
Cambodians in a kind of genocide.

964
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:34,500
And he was,
he survived because he wasn't in country,

965
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:37,650
but all 19 of his family
members were killed.

966
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:42,570
His temple burned. Um,
you know, uh, all the,

967
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:47,250
all the Buddhist texts and
so forth were destroyed. Um,

968
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:51,660
and when he was able to,
he went to the refugee camps,

969
01:03:51,670 --> 01:03:56,010
refugees were pouring out of Cambodia
by the hundreds of thousands,

970
01:03:56,370 --> 01:04:00,950
and he went to the refugee camps on the
border of Thailand and Cambodia. And, um,

971
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:05,340
I was able to go with him
and at a certain point

972
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:11,490
and he decided to open a temple in the
middle of one of the biggest refugee

973
01:04:11,491 --> 01:04:15,720
camps. Here's 50 or a hundred thousand
people, these tiny little bamboo huts,

974
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:20,670
um,
and got permission from the UN,

975
01:04:20,850 --> 01:04:24,150
HCR High Commissioner of refugees,
uh,

976
01:04:24,230 --> 01:04:29,230
and build a platform with a little
roof over it and put an altar with a

977
01:04:30,390 --> 01:04:32,880
traditional Cambodian
Buddha on it and so forth.

978
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:37,830
But it was a camp with the Camaro
rouge underground, um, lots of them.

979
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:43,280
And so they put the word out that
if anyone went to be with this monk,

980
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:47,940
when they got out of the camp back
to Cambodia, they would all be shot.

981
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:53,160
So we wondered who would,
if anyone would come and,

982
01:04:53,190 --> 01:04:56,760
uh,
went through the camp the day,

983
01:04:56,761 --> 01:05:01,761
the opening day with a big kind of
Temple Gong ringing it and 25,000 people

984
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:09,800
poured into the central square around
this little 10 point God and he logos.

985
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:12,360
And the sat there and he was a scholar.

986
01:05:12,361 --> 01:05:16,500
He spoke 15 languages
and he was, uh, you know,

987
01:05:16,540 --> 01:05:17,590
extremely

988
01:05:20,310 --> 01:05:25,210
kind hearted human being who
had suffered enormously, um,

989
01:05:25,270 --> 01:05:29,730
and had transformed it into the kind of
compassion that we think are with the

990
01:05:29,740 --> 01:05:33,550
dollar alarm or something like that.
In fact, they became friends and go,

991
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:35,890
Sonata became the head of
all of Cambodian boozing.

992
01:05:35,891 --> 01:05:38,080
But there he was at this point,

993
01:05:38,650 --> 01:05:43,650
sitting looking out at 25,000 people
who had suffered immense traumas.

994
01:05:44,861 --> 01:05:49,330
And you could see there was a
grandmother and the only two surviving

995
01:05:49,331 --> 01:05:50,710
grandchildren that she had,

996
01:05:50,711 --> 01:05:55,180
or an uncle and one niece and their
faces were the faces of trauma,

997
01:05:55,600 --> 01:06:00,520
um, and of survivors. And I thought, all
right, what is he going to say to them?

998
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:04,570
And he sat very quietly for a long time,

999
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:06,550
just in their presence.

1000
01:06:07,090 --> 01:06:11,770
And then he put his hands together
in this kind of modest way,

1001
01:06:12,150 --> 01:06:14,830
um,
and began to chant in the microphone,

1002
01:06:14,831 --> 01:06:19,831
yet it sound system in Cambodian
and in Sanskrit are Pali,

1003
01:06:20,801 --> 01:06:25,600
the Buddhist language. One of the
first verses from the Buddhist texts,

1004
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:27,790
um,
they'd goes,

1005
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:31,120
hatred never ceases by hatred,

1006
01:06:31,690 --> 01:06:33,850
but by love alone is healed.

1007
01:06:34,210 --> 01:06:37,120
This is the ancient and eternal law.

1008
01:06:37,870 --> 01:06:42,870
And he chanted it over and over
in Cambodian and in Sanskrit,

1009
01:06:43,481 --> 01:06:44,314
Pali.

1010
01:06:44,470 --> 01:06:49,470
And pretty soon the chant was
picked up and in a little while,

1011
01:06:49,721 --> 01:06:53,620
25,000 people were chanting
this averse with him.

1012
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:57,070
And I looked out and they were weeping,
many of them,

1013
01:06:57,071 --> 01:07:02,020
cause they hadn't heard their
sacred chants for years. Um,

1014
01:07:02,350 --> 01:07:07,350
but also because he was offering them
a truth that was even bigger than their

1015
01:07:09,371 --> 01:07:13,300
sorrows.
That hatred never ends by hatred,

1016
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:17,920
but by love alone is healed.
This is the ancient and eternal law.

1017
01:07:18,370 --> 01:07:21,100
And they were sitting in
the middle of the, the,

1018
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:23,760
the healing energy of the Dharma,

1019
01:07:23,761 --> 01:07:27,040
of the teachings of the
heart that can liberate us.

1020
01:07:27,940 --> 01:07:29,620
Later on goes to Nanda,

1021
01:07:29,621 --> 01:07:34,060
who was nominated for the Nobel
peace prize a number of times.

1022
01:07:34,490 --> 01:07:34,990
Um,

1023
01:07:34,990 --> 01:07:39,660
spent 15 years walking through
the killing fields and the,

1024
01:07:39,670 --> 01:07:41,830
you know,
mind areas and so forth,

1025
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:44,860
leading people on foot
back to their village.

1026
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:47,380
And he said to the refugees,

1027
01:07:47,381 --> 01:07:52,381
you can't go back in a boss or the
back of a truck or something like that.

1028
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:55,270
You have to reclaim your land with love.

1029
01:07:56,320 --> 01:08:01,180
And so he would lead a thousand people
and he'd be in the front with a bell and

1030
01:08:01,181 --> 01:08:06,181
a Gong and a few other monks and the
whole way back they would be chanting the

1031
01:08:06,431 --> 01:08:11,410
chance of lovingkindness so that by
the time they got to their village,

1032
01:08:11,890 --> 01:08:16,340
uh, whatever had been destroyed, there
was the sense that they were reclaiming

1033
01:08:16,340 --> 01:08:20,480
not just the land,
but they were reclaiming their own hearts.

1034
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:26,000
That's a beautiful,
really beautiful story.

1035
01:08:26,150 --> 01:08:27,560
And it,

1036
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:33,160
it prompts me to ask a question that
I struggle with answering myself.

1037
01:08:33,830 --> 01:08:34,170
Uh,
and,

1038
01:08:34,170 --> 01:08:39,170
and it's also a question
many of my friends have asked
themselves and I'll take

1039
01:08:40,101 --> 01:08:41,510
a stab at it.
Uh,

1040
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:46,840
how do you decide when
to do deep inner work?

1041
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:52,360
And take an extended period to do that
versus being in the world and trying to

1042
01:08:55,850 --> 01:08:58,070
impact others and the world.

1043
01:08:58,220 --> 01:09:01,010
And to just provide a little
bit of background on that.

1044
01:09:01,610 --> 01:09:06,350
I have friends who are building businesses
or building careers of some type or

1045
01:09:06,351 --> 01:09:10,940
families.
And I at this point do not have wife,

1046
01:09:10,941 --> 01:09:14,510
kids or company to build,
at least with a large organization.

1047
01:09:15,230 --> 01:09:18,800
And I've come back from
various experiments,

1048
01:09:18,801 --> 01:09:23,270
sojourns experiences over weeks or
months and shared these with them.

1049
01:09:23,271 --> 01:09:25,520
And they've,
they've expressed this longing,

1050
01:09:25,521 --> 01:09:28,340
this deep yearning to
do something similar.

1051
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:32,900
And then they asked this question
like, how do I, how do I best decide

1052
01:09:34,580 --> 01:09:39,580
if and when to do the deep extended
work versus being in the world?

1053
01:09:40,041 --> 01:09:44,750
And I know it might be a false dichotomy.
You might not have to choose, but, um,

1054
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:49,670
I'll talk a little bit more just just
to fill the space. But the, uh, I,

1055
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:54,530
I had this experience personally not
long ago when I was in South America and

1056
01:09:54,531 --> 01:09:59,000
had someone telling me, uh,
in sec in Spanish, which was
not their native language.

1057
01:09:59,030 --> 01:10:01,400
Uh, this is an indigenous
tribe, but this, uh,

1058
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:05,980
Upal this mayor effectively who
worked a lot with different, um,

1059
01:10:06,110 --> 01:10:11,110
plant medicines and he said that
he recommended one 15 month diet,

1060
01:10:11,510 --> 01:10:16,280
very, very strict, 15 month period
with many different restrictions,

1061
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:20,060
uh, no sex, no alcohol, no pork, etcetera,

1062
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:25,120
and to develop certain capacities
and to practice in effect,

1063
01:10:25,881 --> 01:10:29,180
I mean at certain types
of meditative practices.

1064
01:10:30,620 --> 01:10:32,480
So I struggle with this myself as well.
How do you,

1065
01:10:32,510 --> 01:10:36,980
how do you suggest someone think through,
so did you give up sex and pork?

1066
01:10:37,590 --> 01:10:41,240
I've done it for short periods of time.
I'm not a year and a half.

1067
01:10:41,241 --> 01:10:44,360
I've done it for weeks at a time,
but not for 15 months.

1068
01:10:44,390 --> 01:10:48,740
But what appealed to me about that,
definitely not the lack of sex and pork.

1069
01:10:48,741 --> 01:10:50,660
I like both of those things.
It was,

1070
01:10:50,661 --> 01:10:53,870
he said that's something you only have
to do once in your life and it opens

1071
01:10:53,871 --> 01:10:58,250
doors and it creates
opportunities that are difficult,

1072
01:10:58,251 --> 01:11:02,960
if not impossible to achieve otherwise.
So of course that's very tantalizing,

1073
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:07,690
but 15 months is a really, really long
time to opt out of everything else. Um,

1074
01:11:07,820 --> 01:11:11,480
and I'm not saying it has to be 15
months for some people as you know,

1075
01:11:11,510 --> 01:11:14,010
setting aside even 10 days
to do silent treat as hard.

1076
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:18,120
And I know there are things that
they can do on an ongoing basis,

1077
01:11:18,121 --> 01:11:19,980
like morning meditation and so on.
But for,

1078
01:11:19,981 --> 01:11:24,420
for those who are really drawn
to this extended deeper work,

1079
01:11:24,450 --> 01:11:25,560
how do you think about,

1080
01:11:25,561 --> 01:11:29,130
and that's why I go Sananda brought it
up for me because he'd spent so much time

1081
01:11:29,131 --> 01:11:31,770
outside of his country and then
went back and was really on the,

1082
01:11:32,070 --> 01:11:35,280
on the ground doing work with locals had.

1083
01:11:35,281 --> 01:11:37,590
How do you think about that or
suggest someone think about it?

1084
01:11:39,340 --> 01:11:41,770
Uh,
first my answer is yes

1085
01:11:43,690 --> 01:11:47,910
because all of the things that you say
are true that yes, there, you know,

1086
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:53,050
most cultures, um, encourage
at some point human beings,

1087
01:11:53,051 --> 01:11:57,160
most wise culture as human beings to step
out of their ordinary roles and their

1088
01:11:57,161 --> 01:12:01,650
ordinary routine. Whether you go to the
mountains or the ocean, you know, or,

1089
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:06,680
or a temple or a change in how you're
living so that you can open up to the

1090
01:12:07,121 --> 01:12:08,600
mystery.
Um,

1091
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:13,000
and so that you also can open up to love
because what I saw with my teachers and

1092
01:12:13,001 --> 01:12:16,180
go sonata as well, nudge
in chat and other is, um,

1093
01:12:16,690 --> 01:12:21,250
that they were able to love no
matter what it was really, eh,

1094
01:12:21,340 --> 01:12:22,210
because they,

1095
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:27,360
they inhabited consciousness in a very
different way than just a small sense of

1096
01:12:28,361 --> 01:12:28,721
self.

1097
01:12:28,721 --> 01:12:33,721
There was something much a possibility
that we could live with forgiveness and

1098
01:12:35,201 --> 01:12:39,650
love and be really effective in
the world at the same time. Um,

1099
01:12:39,730 --> 01:12:42,070
so they're not separate.
And that's sort of what your question is,

1100
01:12:42,071 --> 01:12:46,150
how do we live in the world? Um,
and at the same time, you know,

1101
01:12:46,151 --> 01:12:50,890
what trainings and how do we connect
with something deeper and part of it is

1102
01:12:50,891 --> 01:12:54,580
just intuitive. You know, Tim, um,

1103
01:12:55,110 --> 01:12:59,770
Eh, if you have new more than, you
know, or young children and so forth,

1104
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:04,480
it's not the time to go on a long retreat.
Your kids are your practice.

1105
01:13:04,810 --> 01:13:05,643
And in fact,

1106
01:13:05,740 --> 01:13:10,740
you can't get as zen master who is
going to be more demanding then,

1107
01:13:12,010 --> 01:13:16,450
you know, an infant with
colic. Right. Or, you know,

1108
01:13:16,451 --> 01:13:21,430
or a teenage, you know, certain teenage
kids where you, but with the young ones,

1109
01:13:21,790 --> 01:13:23,200
you know,
years end master might say,

1110
01:13:23,210 --> 01:13:25,420
you've got to get up early
in the morning and you know,

1111
01:13:25,421 --> 01:13:28,600
once in a while you might roll over,
the kid is crying and sick.

1112
01:13:28,630 --> 01:13:33,430
You have to get up. Um, your family
needs tending and the, you know,

1113
01:13:33,431 --> 01:13:36,400
if you're even vaguely,
um,

1114
01:13:37,180 --> 01:13:41,060
a responsible and caring parent as you,

1115
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:45,220
that becomes your practice.
And if you think, well,

1116
01:13:45,970 --> 01:13:50,110
if only I could be in the great zen
temple of Kyoto or an Ashram in India are

1117
01:13:50,111 --> 01:13:53,230
down in the Amazon with Tim,
you know,

1118
01:13:53,620 --> 01:13:58,060
taking Iowasca or whatever that
plant medicine they give, you know,

1119
01:13:58,210 --> 01:14:02,710
your kid is, can be like
Iowasca on steroids. Okay.

1120
01:14:02,711 --> 01:14:07,390
You want to, you want to face yourself
and your own limitations and your own,

1121
01:14:07,660 --> 01:14:08,493
you know,

1122
01:14:08,650 --> 01:14:13,030
you want to look at the smallest sense
self and find out how to live with it,

1123
01:14:13,270 --> 01:14:15,400
where the freer and bigger spirit here,

1124
01:14:15,401 --> 01:14:20,170
we just hired someone to live with you
and train you full time. So it's really,

1125
01:14:20,410 --> 01:14:23,640
you know, um, and that's an
important thing. But what,

1126
01:14:23,670 --> 01:14:27,170
what makes it work is that,
um,

1127
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:32,350
you have that intention not
just to soldier through it,

1128
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:37,920
but to say,
let this be a place where I awake and um,

1129
01:14:38,650 --> 01:14:43,650
graciousness and inner sense of freedom
and peace as things come and go where I

1130
01:14:44,081 --> 01:14:46,660
awaken the possibility of presence,
um,

1131
01:14:47,050 --> 01:14:51,760
in pleasure and pain and joy and sorrow
and gain and loss and all the changes

1132
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:55,060
that I find, uh, uh, an invite, a more,

1133
01:14:55,220 --> 01:15:00,220
a timeless place of becoming
the loving witness of it all,

1134
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:04,330
becoming the loving awareness that says,
yeah,

1135
01:15:04,510 --> 01:15:09,510
now I'm having a family experience and
this is the place to find freedom because

1136
01:15:10,481 --> 01:15:13,330
freedom is not in the
Himalayas or in the Amazon.

1137
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:18,250
The only place it's found is in your
own heart exactly where you are.

1138
01:15:18,820 --> 01:15:22,180
And that's what goes to Nanda,
Todd. And when, what Jen Cha,

1139
01:15:22,390 --> 01:15:26,560
that's really what they wanted to
communicate. Now that being said,

1140
01:15:26,710 --> 01:15:31,330
if you have an opportunity and you're
drawn to it like somebody you might do,

1141
01:15:31,331 --> 01:15:34,280
you know Jack Dorsey? Jack. Yeah.

1142
01:15:34,510 --> 01:15:39,510
So Jack just did his first 10 day
meditation retreat and he tweeted about,

1143
01:15:41,471 --> 01:15:45,460
I wouldn't say it otherwise, but he
tweeted about it and it was, you know,

1144
01:15:45,461 --> 01:15:48,970
one of the top transformative
experiences of his life.

1145
01:15:48,971 --> 01:15:52,270
And it's not to say 10 day retreats
are the be all and end all. They are.

1146
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:55,900
They're very powerful and
compelling. Um, but you,

1147
01:15:55,930 --> 01:15:59,380
even if you have a company
or even if you have a family,

1148
01:15:59,590 --> 01:16:04,590
there might be a period of a week or
some days where you can in fact get away,

1149
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:09,580
um, and step out of those
roles and turn inward.

1150
01:16:09,790 --> 01:16:13,210
And that can be tremendously valuable.
So I think both are important.

1151
01:16:13,211 --> 01:16:14,950
You just have to listen what the,
when the time

1152
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:19,180
it's right.
So there are so many things that this,

1153
01:16:19,210 --> 01:16:20,670
this brings up the,

1154
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:24,350
the first though is just a housekeeping
for people who may not recognize the

1155
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:27,910
named Jack Dorsey. Uh,
that's Jack at Jack,

1156
01:16:27,940 --> 01:16:30,180
I believe it is on Twitter of a,

1157
01:16:30,190 --> 01:16:35,110
you might add then wonder how did
he get that user handle? Well, uh,

1158
01:16:35,230 --> 01:16:36,820
he's,
he's one of the people behind Twitter.

1159
01:16:36,821 --> 01:16:40,960
So you use of Twitter and square fame
among many others. A fascinating,

1160
01:16:40,961 --> 01:16:45,310
fascinating guy. Uh, so
people can check him out. The,

1161
01:16:46,030 --> 01:16:46,863
uh,

1162
01:16:47,020 --> 01:16:51,790
the comment on the infant being the
full time trainer working with you, 24,

1163
01:16:51,791 --> 01:16:56,030
seven reminded me also since you
mentioned Ron doss earlier of a,

1164
01:16:56,031 --> 01:16:59,650
a quote of his that I like, and
I'm going to paraphrase, I'm sure,

1165
01:16:59,651 --> 01:17:02,590
but if you think you're enlightened,
go spend a week with your family.

1166
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:04,860
Yeah,
yeah.

1167
01:17:05,350 --> 01:17:09,850
Which I think is a fantastic one. And
that's part of the reason, uh, and,

1168
01:17:09,910 --> 01:17:13,010
and you know, some of the
backstory, but, uh, we all have,

1169
01:17:13,790 --> 01:17:17,540
I would imagine we all have tough things
that happen to us. Experienced trauma,

1170
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:22,550
traumatic experiences as children have
a lot of triggers related to family

1171
01:17:22,551 --> 01:17:25,940
members typically. And, uh, for me,

1172
01:17:25,941 --> 01:17:30,350
the forced to break takes a
number of different forms,

1173
01:17:30,380 --> 01:17:35,380
but that includes a trip every six months
and extended trip of two to four weeks

1174
01:17:35,661 --> 01:17:39,300
with my parents and my brother
when he can make it. Um,

1175
01:17:39,380 --> 01:17:44,360
so that's only after being
introduced to meditation,

1176
01:17:44,361 --> 01:17:48,660
something that I would even consider
as a practice. And, uh, the,

1177
01:17:48,780 --> 01:17:52,220
the last point I'll mention just out
of my personal experience is that a,

1178
01:17:52,730 --> 01:17:56,930
there's a piece of paper I have in my
wallet and I've had in my wallet for a few

1179
01:17:56,930 --> 01:17:58,340
years now.
It's getting a bit worn down.

1180
01:17:59,370 --> 01:18:03,960
It's a piece of construction paper and
an ex girlfriend gave it to me who,

1181
01:18:04,310 --> 01:18:08,480
who knew me very well. And it says, the
task that hinders your task is your task

1182
01:18:09,890 --> 01:18:10,723
beautiful.

1183
01:18:11,740 --> 01:18:14,080
And uh,
that's a good reminder for me.

1184
01:18:14,140 --> 01:18:17,800
I wanted to ask you two questions that,

1185
01:18:18,370 --> 01:18:22,270
uh, are personally important, uh, but,

1186
01:18:22,271 --> 01:18:23,530
but also may apply to other people.

1187
01:18:23,531 --> 01:18:28,000
The first is the question that I believe
you mentioned Adrienne Cha perhaps

1188
01:18:28,001 --> 01:18:31,870
others have indicated is
the question versus the,

1189
01:18:32,350 --> 01:18:37,350
the experiences or movies of these
say out of body experiences and so on.

1190
01:18:37,690 --> 01:18:41,800
To whom do they happen? Right? To
whom do they happen? Is this a Koan?

1191
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:45,700
Like what does the sound
of one hand clapping where
there isn't really an answer?

1192
01:18:45,701 --> 01:18:48,430
You're are,
you're expected to arrive at is,

1193
01:18:48,490 --> 01:18:52,030
is the value in contemplating the
question more than any answer?

1194
01:18:54,060 --> 01:18:58,710
Yes. Both. Yes. Both. And no,

1195
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:02,820
because, um, it is,

1196
01:19:02,910 --> 01:19:07,540
it's a profound contemplation for
us. One of the great, you know,

1197
01:19:07,950 --> 01:19:12,110
questions of human incarnation. Who
are we? How do we get into that?

1198
01:19:12,111 --> 01:19:16,620
How did you get into this body with the
wiggly things on the end of your limbs,

1199
01:19:16,621 --> 01:19:20,610
you know, little fits of a
clause that you have, you know,

1200
01:19:20,611 --> 01:19:24,960
his nails and this digital tail and that
whole at one end into which you stuffed

1201
01:19:24,961 --> 01:19:28,200
dead plants and animals and glug
them down through the tube. I mean,

1202
01:19:28,201 --> 01:19:32,490
the whole incarnation thing is
really pretty wild. So who are we?

1203
01:19:32,850 --> 01:19:34,980
And then what are, what, how
do we make meaning of it?

1204
01:19:34,981 --> 01:19:39,510
What this is that this is a lifetime
question and that way that it's a on,

1205
01:19:39,870 --> 01:19:43,200
but in another way,
it also actually does have an answer.

1206
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:47,010
And the answer,
of course has to be found by each person.

1207
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:50,740
The answer to point toward it.
Um,

1208
01:19:50,940 --> 01:19:54,900
it's very clear that you're not just your,
you know,

1209
01:19:55,830 --> 01:19:59,970
salad and vegetables and hamburger
body and you're not just your emotions.

1210
01:19:59,971 --> 01:20:03,060
I hope cause they're always changing
and your thoughts. Good God,

1211
01:20:03,061 --> 01:20:06,840
I hope you're not your thoughts. Um,
so you start to realize, all right,

1212
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:12,060
why is there then,
what is this self?

1213
01:20:12,061 --> 01:20:14,130
Who am I in neuroscience?
You know,

1214
01:20:14,660 --> 01:20:19,660
there was a Time magazine issue on
modern neuroscience where it said

1215
01:20:20,191 --> 01:20:24,750
neuroscience to search throughout the
brain over many decades now and come to

1216
01:20:24,751 --> 01:20:29,751
the conclusion that they cannot find
the self located anywhere in the neural

1217
01:20:30,241 --> 01:20:33,720
mechanisms of the brain and
that it simply does not exist.

1218
01:20:34,710 --> 01:20:39,710
But what does exist is a sense of
self that's built out of a sense of

1219
01:20:40,710 --> 01:20:44,430
identification with our thoughts and
body and so forth. It's all wise,

1220
01:20:44,431 --> 01:20:45,900
inappropriate.
We should be,

1221
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:51,380
but we also know that it's not the end
of the story and you know it from walking

1222
01:20:54,931 --> 01:20:59,370
in the high mountains or listening to an
extraordinary piece of music or making

1223
01:20:59,371 --> 01:21:03,240
love or taking some ex, some
sacred medicine, you know,

1224
01:21:03,241 --> 01:21:06,480
are sitting at the bedside
of someone when they die.

1225
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:11,480
That mysterious moment when spirit
leaves the body or when a child is born.

1226
01:21:12,420 --> 01:21:17,420
We have these moments where we open to
mystery and realize that who we are is

1227
01:21:17,881 --> 01:21:21,750
not just our personal history
or our body and emotions,

1228
01:21:22,170 --> 01:21:25,140
that we become the consciousness itself,

1229
01:21:25,590 --> 01:21:27,870
the witnessing awareness,

1230
01:21:27,871 --> 01:21:31,350
that we are the loving awareness
that was born into this body.

1231
01:21:31,830 --> 01:21:35,850
And that becomes actually
a direct knowing,

1232
01:21:35,851 --> 01:21:37,580
a direct experience.
So there is a,

1233
01:21:38,990 --> 01:21:43,990
a way in which we also can come home
to ourselves and it brings a tremendous

1234
01:21:44,881 --> 01:21:49,080
sense of freedom and wellbeing,
um,

1235
01:21:49,350 --> 01:21:53,550
as all the movies of haver
changing life happened to us.

1236
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:58,370
So that's why I said yes, yes
and no. And both. Um, and I,

1237
01:21:58,380 --> 01:22:02,460
there's just a little aside thinking
about you going back to your family as a

1238
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:05,220
practicing twice a year as you're doing,

1239
01:22:05,610 --> 01:22:08,760
I just want to remind you
in the listeners that, um,

1240
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:12,660
Buddha and Jesus both had a hard time
when they went back to their family.

1241
01:22:12,661 --> 01:22:17,190
So don't think that it, you know,
there's something wrong with you,

1242
01:22:17,970 --> 01:22:22,260
part of it. So that's why they call it
nuclear family. I think some, anyway,

1243
01:22:23,490 --> 01:22:27,370
uh, the, uh, there's another,

1244
01:22:27,730 --> 01:22:32,110
I guess it's a word more than a question
that I'd love to ask you to define and

1245
01:22:32,111 --> 01:22:37,060
that is compassion or compassionate. When
you use that word or those words, what,

1246
01:22:37,061 --> 01:22:40,510
what do you mean exactly? Or what
would you like it to me and for people?

1247
01:22:41,090 --> 01:22:41,923
Um,

1248
01:22:41,980 --> 01:22:46,980
I would like to distinguish
compassion from empathy.

1249
01:22:48,580 --> 01:22:51,490
Um,
and I'll use a simple illustration.

1250
01:22:52,150 --> 01:22:57,150
If you're on the playground and you
see a kid being bullied and you feel,

1251
01:22:57,490 --> 01:23:01,630
oh, that must feel terrible, that
hurts, right? That's an empathy.

1252
01:23:02,020 --> 01:23:04,960
And empathy can be useful.
It also can,

1253
01:23:05,170 --> 01:23:08,080
you can get overwhelmed by empathy
if you don't know what to do with it.

1254
01:23:08,081 --> 01:23:12,790
But there's some way in which you
start to feel resonating. You,

1255
01:23:12,791 --> 01:23:15,190
because we are not
limited to these bodies.

1256
01:23:15,191 --> 01:23:18,280
We are actually a and interconnected

1257
01:23:20,530 --> 01:23:23,560
system of consciousness.

1258
01:23:23,561 --> 01:23:28,000
And I'll talk about that
a little bit more. Um, uh,

1259
01:23:28,150 --> 01:23:29,570
in a minute.
Um,

1260
01:23:29,650 --> 01:23:34,650
but we all know whether it's mirror
neurons from neuroscience or the field of

1261
01:23:35,471 --> 01:23:37,660
presence as, as neuro, you know,

1262
01:23:38,410 --> 01:23:43,410
scientists like Dan Siegel talk about
extended presence that we can feel empathy

1263
01:23:44,231 --> 01:23:47,770
with one another. When someone's sadness,
someone's angry, um, someone's hurting.

1264
01:23:49,090 --> 01:23:53,650
Compassion is the next step.
You, you, you see or recognize,

1265
01:23:53,651 --> 01:23:57,520
you feel,
and then you care.

1266
01:23:57,910 --> 01:24:00,010
You care about it and you want to,

1267
01:24:00,011 --> 01:24:04,810
if you can do something that helps so
that you see the kid being bullied and you

1268
01:24:04,811 --> 01:24:09,040
realize, um, I want to tell
the teacher or the principal,

1269
01:24:09,041 --> 01:24:10,630
or I want to just walk over there and,

1270
01:24:10,670 --> 01:24:15,370
and say something or intervene to
help stop it. And so compassion,

1271
01:24:15,730 --> 01:24:19,680
it's called the quivering of the heart,
um,

1272
01:24:19,960 --> 01:24:24,960
when it wants to move to alleviate the
suffering of yourself because you can

1273
01:24:25,001 --> 01:24:28,750
have self compassion.
It's very important or those around you.

1274
01:24:29,020 --> 01:24:33,670
And it's born into,
and the earliest studies of infants,

1275
01:24:33,910 --> 01:24:38,650
um, you know, at Yale and various
places like that show that even very,

1276
01:24:38,651 --> 01:24:43,360
very, very small children have this
resonance and this kind of care.

1277
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:46,690
Um,
and so it's not shut down in us.

1278
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:51,040
We were a species that's interconnected
and we care for one another.

1279
01:24:51,041 --> 01:24:55,090
And this is your birthright,
this natural, natural compassion.

1280
01:24:55,210 --> 01:24:59,830
And through practice in meditation,
you can reawaken it, you can extend it,

1281
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:01,053
um,

1282
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:06,120
and it can become your way of
living and moving in the world.

1283
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:10,650
Um, as a little aside, and I'll
just bookmark this one, um,

1284
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:15,650
just got back from a conference
with our dear friend Adam Gozali,

1285
01:25:15,651 --> 01:25:17,920
our mutual friend,
Richie Davidson,

1286
01:25:17,921 --> 01:25:21,550
who is another of the most
famous neuroscientists,

1287
01:25:21,551 --> 01:25:25,030
especially in this area.
Um, and a number of other,

1288
01:25:25,060 --> 01:25:30,060
some contemplative lives
and neuroscientists and
some technologists from the

1289
01:25:30,131 --> 01:25:35,131
valley and VC talking about how to build
compassion into our interface with the

1290
01:25:36,491 --> 01:25:39,640
technological world, compassion tech. Um,

1291
01:25:39,730 --> 01:25:43,150
and in from starting from the
very simplest things of projects,

1292
01:25:43,151 --> 01:25:45,700
like can you build a
fitbit for compassion,

1293
01:25:46,300 --> 01:25:51,300
where instead of your body where you
can either no moments of care around you

1294
01:25:52,131 --> 01:25:56,260
are in yourself or be prompted
to care for yourself, you know,

1295
01:25:56,261 --> 01:25:59,920
or when you say to Siri or Alexa,
you know, I'm feeling lonely,

1296
01:25:59,921 --> 01:26:03,260
or you know, and so forth. Um,

1297
01:26:03,470 --> 01:26:05,480
what kind of response
do you get from them?

1298
01:26:05,570 --> 01:26:10,570
From the algorithms and
all of that because the UK,

1299
01:26:11,900 --> 01:26:14,060
England, uh, just, uh, uh,

1300
01:26:14,061 --> 01:26:19,010
pointed their first minister of loneliness
for the country and I think it was a

1301
01:26:19,011 --> 01:26:23,780
joke, but it's not like an old
Beatles song. All the lonely people,

1302
01:26:23,910 --> 01:26:26,150
there are 10 million
lonely people in England,

1303
01:26:26,151 --> 01:26:30,140
Dave estimated and this minister
has got cut and it's, you know,

1304
01:26:30,290 --> 01:26:35,290
it's for isolation and loss of capacity
and health and all kinds of reasons that

1305
01:26:35,421 --> 01:26:37,190
loneliness makes things way worse.

1306
01:26:37,580 --> 01:26:42,580
But there's some way in which
compassion is that which connects us.

1307
01:26:43,910 --> 01:26:47,600
And it's a beautiful thing. Even if you
walked on the street and you see someone,

1308
01:26:47,990 --> 01:26:50,180
you know who's struggling and so forth,

1309
01:26:50,300 --> 01:26:53,810
it doesn't mean you have to fix the
whole world. That's not your job.

1310
01:26:53,811 --> 01:26:57,530
That would be egotistical.
But you can reach your hand out in men,

1311
01:26:57,531 --> 01:26:58,700
the things that you can,

1312
01:26:58,701 --> 01:27:03,050
you can tend to things that you can
and you can do it not because, oh,

1313
01:27:03,051 --> 01:27:06,860
you pity them, those poor people,
but because they're your family,

1314
01:27:07,220 --> 01:27:11,900
you recognize that we're common humanity.
We're in this together.

1315
01:27:15,020 --> 01:27:20,020
I'd like to build on that and preface
it with a comment on the tech.

1316
01:27:20,761 --> 01:27:25,761
So you mentioned collaborating with Adam
and he's discussing the potential of

1317
01:27:26,300 --> 01:27:31,300
combining or utilizing technology to
help people to develop and harness

1318
01:27:32,121 --> 01:27:34,760
compassion. And some folks listening
might be like, oh, come on,

1319
01:27:34,790 --> 01:27:35,690
that's so pie in the sky.

1320
01:27:35,691 --> 01:27:40,640
But I'd like to point out that you've
already collaborated successfully with

1321
01:27:40,641 --> 01:27:45,470
Adam on software like meditrain,
uh, m, e, d, I, t, r, a,

1322
01:27:45,471 --> 01:27:46,220
I n,

1323
01:27:46,220 --> 01:27:50,660
which was one of the tools Adam has
used in his end of one or end of two

1324
01:27:50,661 --> 01:27:55,661
experiments in a rejuvenating
his mental capacity to,

1325
01:27:55,881 --> 01:27:59,420
I want to say in his twenties and
Adams Adams, one of those guys,

1326
01:27:59,421 --> 01:28:02,480
you can't tell if he's
28 or 45 and he's just a,

1327
01:28:02,540 --> 01:28:05,450
a silver Fox will always looks young. So
I don't know how old he is, but he's not,

1328
01:28:05,451 --> 01:28:10,370
he's not 22. Uh, but the Mediterranean
was one of the tools that he utilized.

1329
01:28:10,430 --> 01:28:15,140
And uh, I don't remember the name that
he used for this run of experiments.

1330
01:28:15,141 --> 01:28:18,410
You might know that the training that
he did neuro man or something like that

1331
01:28:18,950 --> 01:28:20,510
was very, very successful. Uh,

1332
01:28:20,810 --> 01:28:24,320
so you already have a track record
of collaborating successfully with

1333
01:28:24,321 --> 01:28:28,220
neuroscientists and technologists.
The on the,

1334
01:28:28,280 --> 01:28:29,960
the compassion front,

1335
01:28:29,961 --> 01:28:34,961
I'd love to use that as a
segue to loving kindness.

1336
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:38,750
And by way of personal example,

1337
01:28:39,380 --> 01:28:43,280
I failed but failed as a strong word.
I quit,

1338
01:28:43,370 --> 01:28:47,960
I stopped meditating after many,
many attempts,

1339
01:28:47,990 --> 01:28:52,990
had very absurdly high number
of false starts over many years.

1340
01:28:53,930 --> 01:28:55,050
Uh, and it's, it,

1341
01:28:55,260 --> 01:28:59,360
it really stuck after a number
of experiments and experiences.

1342
01:28:59,361 --> 01:29:04,361
I had a doing three or four
day trainings with say,

1343
01:29:04,411 --> 01:29:06,900
transcendental meditation and
having the Social Accountability,

1344
01:29:06,930 --> 01:29:08,700
being accountable to someone else's.
Very helpful.

1345
01:29:08,940 --> 01:29:13,940
But another turning point
was experimenting with
loving kindness meditation.

1346
01:29:14,340 --> 01:29:18,330
And I think in part it's exceeded because
it took the focus off of me, me, me,

1347
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:22,470
and allowed me to focus on others.

1348
01:29:22,471 --> 01:29:27,471
But I'd like to read a brief paragraph
from a profile of you in the New York.

1349
01:29:30,290 --> 01:29:35,290
New York Times is from 2014 and feel free
to correct anything that is incorrect,

1350
01:29:35,431 --> 01:29:39,450
but I'll, I'll give it a read
first. And I quote in the West,

1351
01:29:39,510 --> 01:29:40,950
Kornfield says,
quote,

1352
01:29:40,980 --> 01:29:44,470
we encounter a lot of intense striving
ambition and a lot of self criticism,

1353
01:29:44,471 --> 01:29:47,940
self judgment and self
hatred and quote concerned.

1354
01:29:47,941 --> 01:29:49,770
He initially turned to
the Dalai Lama for advice,

1355
01:29:49,771 --> 01:29:52,860
but self hatred was such a foreign
concept to the Tibetan Buddhist that he

1356
01:29:52,861 --> 01:29:55,560
wasn't able to offer any real insight.
Over time,

1357
01:29:55,561 --> 01:29:58,890
cornfield and his colleagues began to
believe that Americans needed particular

1358
01:29:58,891 --> 01:30:00,690
meditation closely.
I'm sorry,

1359
01:30:00,691 --> 01:30:05,340
practice closely linked to the concepts
of self forgiveness and loving kindness.

1360
01:30:05,700 --> 01:30:09,000
A training and the unconditional
acceptance of imperfection without such a

1361
01:30:09,001 --> 01:30:11,670
foundation says cornfield
meditation can easily become,

1362
01:30:11,671 --> 01:30:15,150
and this is the part that I underlined
and starred without this foundation says

1363
01:30:15,151 --> 01:30:18,990
cornfield meditation can easily become
yet another form of striving quote,

1364
01:30:19,020 --> 01:30:22,860
another thing you do to make yourself
better and quote instead of a path to true

1365
01:30:22,861 --> 01:30:27,060
contentment.
So could you please describe for folks,

1366
01:30:28,330 --> 01:30:28,800
uh,

1367
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:33,800
what loving kindness meditation practice
looks like and elaborate in any way

1368
01:30:33,991 --> 01:30:36,960
that you feel might be,
might be useful or helpful for folks?

1369
01:30:37,630 --> 01:30:41,200
Yeah. Um, and, um, that meeting,

1370
01:30:41,201 --> 01:30:44,530
which was some decades ago
with the Dalai Lama, yeah.

1371
01:30:44,531 --> 01:30:47,280
He didn't understand when we talked
about south hatred, he couldn't eat.

1372
01:30:47,300 --> 01:30:52,030
There is no word for it back and forth
with his translator. What does this mean?

1373
01:30:52,300 --> 01:30:56,350
Fine. He looked up, he said, man, but this
is a mistake. Why would anyone do this?

1374
01:30:56,351 --> 01:30:58,510
But then he asked,
how many of you,

1375
01:30:58,740 --> 01:31:02,020
there was a group of us who were
teachers have experienced this and almost

1376
01:31:02,021 --> 01:31:03,220
everyone raised their hand.

1377
01:31:03,640 --> 01:31:08,640
So we see that when people begin in our
culture and in the west to meditate or

1378
01:31:12,581 --> 01:31:16,540
to try to in turn inward really, that, um,

1379
01:31:16,630 --> 01:31:21,630
it's very common to encounter
a lot of self criticism,

1380
01:31:22,430 --> 01:31:26,170
self judgment, or even self hatred. Um,

1381
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:29,140
and you know,
they're all the causes from are,

1382
01:31:29,290 --> 01:31:34,060
these are all kind of conditioning
that we got from, from our childhood,

1383
01:31:34,061 --> 01:31:35,650
our education and so forth.

1384
01:31:35,950 --> 01:31:39,190
But what it means is that you're sitting
there saying, I'm not doing it right.

1385
01:31:39,430 --> 01:31:42,550
I'm no good.
You turn meditation into one other,

1386
01:31:42,580 --> 01:31:45,490
one of the things that you don't do
right cause you can't control your mind.

1387
01:31:46,030 --> 01:31:50,890
The truth is that you can't control your
mind easily. That's not the point. Um,

1388
01:31:51,130 --> 01:31:56,130
there's a different way of approaching
your mind which gives you tremendous

1389
01:31:56,210 --> 01:31:58,960
capacities, but it's not, oh
I have to stop my thinking.

1390
01:31:59,050 --> 01:32:01,960
I don't want to have these fields and
I hate having all these judgments.

1391
01:32:01,961 --> 01:32:05,860
I don't want to be so judgmental islands
thought I hate this judging mind.

1392
01:32:06,010 --> 01:32:07,360
What does it just more judgment.

1393
01:32:07,990 --> 01:32:12,990
So instead is you become first
able to become the loving witness,

1394
01:32:13,580 --> 01:32:16,390
the,
the mindful loving awareness that says,

1395
01:32:16,420 --> 01:32:20,440
oh this is the judging mind and
it's been trying to protect me.

1396
01:32:20,441 --> 01:32:24,490
Thank you for trying to protect me.
I don't need you now. Thank you. Um,

1397
01:32:24,640 --> 01:32:26,860
all of a sudden there's
a distance from the,

1398
01:32:27,910 --> 01:32:32,800
from the painful or destructive or,
or um,

1399
01:32:32,801 --> 01:32:37,801
self critical thoughts simply by
witnessing them with loving awareness and

1400
01:32:38,291 --> 01:32:39,340
acknowledging them.

1401
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:44,740
This becomes the gateway to the
practice of lovingkindness and self.

1402
01:32:44,950 --> 01:32:47,200
Self compassion.
Um,

1403
01:32:48,190 --> 01:32:50,770
and very often people
can't do it for themselves.

1404
01:32:50,771 --> 01:32:55,450
They feel that's too much of a stretch.
Like why would I wish myself well,

1405
01:32:55,451 --> 01:32:57,490
it feels egotistical.
Um,

1406
01:32:57,550 --> 01:33:02,140
and so the way that this practice,

1407
01:33:02,240 --> 01:33:05,560
um, begins for, uh,

1408
01:33:06,010 --> 01:33:07,270
skillfully for,

1409
01:33:07,310 --> 01:33:12,310
for such folks is instead to think of
someone that you really care about a lot.

1410
01:33:14,230 --> 01:33:17,630
Um, and to picture them, remember them,

1411
01:33:17,650 --> 01:33:22,390
put them in your mind's eye and feel the
kind of well wishing you would want for

1412
01:33:22,391 --> 01:33:23,560
them.
You know,

1413
01:33:23,561 --> 01:33:27,970
may they be protected
and safe from difficulty.

1414
01:33:28,420 --> 01:33:31,540
May they be held in loving kindness,

1415
01:33:32,200 --> 01:33:35,020
may they be well, healthy, strong,

1416
01:33:35,560 --> 01:33:39,370
and you wish them that may they be happy.
And you do this for a time,

1417
01:33:39,371 --> 01:33:42,370
a kind of inner well-wishing.
Um,

1418
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:47,700
and also maybe you feel as you think
of this person that you care about,

1419
01:33:48,760 --> 01:33:52,540
if you let yourself also tune in to
the measure of sorrows they have,

1420
01:33:52,900 --> 01:33:56,170
the struggles that every human being has,
you know,

1421
01:33:56,171 --> 01:34:00,700
and it tenderizes your heart as you think
of them because you don't want them to

1422
01:34:00,701 --> 01:34:04,540
suffer. You feel the kind of
rising of compassion and care.

1423
01:34:04,990 --> 01:34:07,240
So may they hold
themselves and compassion.

1424
01:34:07,241 --> 01:34:10,210
May they be safe and protected and well,

1425
01:34:10,420 --> 01:34:13,930
and you do that with water to people
that you care about for a time.

1426
01:34:15,880 --> 01:34:20,110
And then you can imagine
even as I'm describing this,

1427
01:34:20,111 --> 01:34:21,730
and you following your own heart,

1428
01:34:22,120 --> 01:34:27,120
you could imagine these two loved ones
looking back at you it with the same

1429
01:34:29,861 --> 01:34:31,870
kindness and saying,

1430
01:34:31,930 --> 01:34:36,930
just as you wish us protection and safety
and happiness and wellbeing and oh and

1431
01:34:37,931 --> 01:34:41,710
compassion,
they gaze at you and they say you too.

1432
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:45,130
May you be safe and protected.

1433
01:34:45,820 --> 01:34:50,820
May you be filled with tender
compassion for yourself and kindness.

1434
01:34:51,670 --> 01:34:56,670
May you too be healthy and well,

1435
01:34:57,330 --> 01:35:01,160
may you be happy. They want
you to be happy. I think about,

1436
01:35:01,161 --> 01:35:02,240
and when I'm doing this,

1437
01:35:02,241 --> 01:35:05,960
I'm visualizing some loved ones
and I know that as I do it,

1438
01:35:05,961 --> 01:35:09,830
I can feel they want that for me.
And then finally,

1439
01:35:10,340 --> 01:35:13,850
as you feel that from these loved ones,

1440
01:35:14,120 --> 01:35:17,360
you can put your hand on your body
or your heart even if you like,

1441
01:35:17,810 --> 01:35:18,840
and take it in and,

1442
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:22,820
and then begin to realize that
you can wish this for yourself.

1443
01:35:22,821 --> 01:35:27,821
May I hold all of the joys and sorrows
of my life with tenderness and kindness.

1444
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:31,790
May I hold my struggles with compassion?

1445
01:35:32,330 --> 01:35:36,530
May I be filled with loving
kindness and loving awareness.

1446
01:35:37,220 --> 01:35:39,320
May I be safe and protected?

1447
01:35:40,070 --> 01:35:43,670
May I be well strong,
are healed.

1448
01:35:44,090 --> 01:35:49,090
And as you repeat these
simple interventions that
have been done for thousands

1449
01:35:50,240 --> 01:35:53,510
of years,
it's as if your cells are listening.

1450
01:35:53,511 --> 01:35:58,511
And this is the research of people like
Liz Blackburn and Alyssa Apple Hoo Hoo.

1451
01:35:59,060 --> 01:36:04,060
There's blackboard and got the Nobel
prize for discovering the telomerase and

1452
01:36:05,210 --> 01:36:09,200
the telomeres mirrors at the
end of the caps and the DNA. Um,

1453
01:36:09,830 --> 01:36:14,690
it turns out that your cells listen to
your heart and that to your intention,

1454
01:36:14,691 --> 01:36:18,740
that consciousness affects your body.
And little by little,

1455
01:36:18,890 --> 01:36:23,270
even though it can bring up its opposite,
I hate myself, I'm never be good enough.

1456
01:36:23,271 --> 01:36:26,330
And you see all those and you just say
thank you for trying to protect me.

1457
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:30,740
I appreciate that. May I be well,
may I be safe, may I be held in love.

1458
01:36:31,010 --> 01:36:33,440
And little by little
like water on a stone,

1459
01:36:33,770 --> 01:36:38,770
it starts to soften the places that are
holding your lack of self forgiveness,

1460
01:36:40,431 --> 01:36:45,431
your lack of care and love and
kindness starts to grow in you.

1461
01:36:45,710 --> 01:36:49,670
And it's a very beautiful
practice. There's lots of
places you can find it on my,

1462
01:36:49,970 --> 01:36:54,970
in my work and teachers like
Sharon Salzberg and family
children and Tara Brock

1463
01:36:55,611 --> 01:36:59,960
and [inaudible] and so forth.
Are there any particular,

1464
01:36:59,990 --> 01:37:02,720
do you have any guided,

1465
01:37:02,840 --> 01:37:06,950
loving kindness meditations or audio
that you can recommend people listen to?

1466
01:37:07,730 --> 01:37:11,930
I do. Um, and uh, I don't know.

1467
01:37:12,080 --> 01:37:16,490
They could go on my website,
Jack kornfield.com. I think
they will be on there.

1468
01:37:16,491 --> 01:37:21,491
I do know for sure I have a whole series
of great programs with sounds true with

1469
01:37:21,820 --> 01:37:24,810
soundstrue.com that include,
um,

1470
01:37:25,070 --> 01:37:30,070
meditations on the mine vast as the sky
meditations on compassion and loving

1471
01:37:30,111 --> 01:37:34,750
kindness. Um, and I did a book, one
of the books I've done is called, um,

1472
01:37:35,330 --> 01:37:39,590
a lamp in the darkness and it contains,
uh,

1473
01:37:40,490 --> 01:37:42,670
I think eight or nine different,
um,

1474
01:37:42,710 --> 01:37:45,950
guided practices that you can
get either with it on the CD,

1475
01:37:45,951 --> 01:37:48,740
but you can get it as a
download basically. Um,

1476
01:37:48,980 --> 01:37:53,390
and sounds true also has that and has
a compassion practice and a grounding

1477
01:37:53,391 --> 01:37:58,391
practice in a kind of a vast sky
like mine practice and so forth.

1478
01:37:58,501 --> 01:38:02,000
So you, so you can look off,
look for all of those. Wonderful.

1479
01:38:02,420 --> 01:38:04,260
The beautiful thing is
that you can learn this.

1480
01:38:04,261 --> 01:38:09,261
And I was couple of years ago invited
to be part of the first White House

1481
01:38:10,231 --> 01:38:13,740
Buddhist leadership gathering.
Um,

1482
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:17,430
there were 120 Buddhist leaders
from around the country,

1483
01:38:17,431 --> 01:38:21,000
from different communities. I don't think
that's going to happen again very soon,

1484
01:38:21,001 --> 01:38:24,210
but there it was. Um, and uh,

1485
01:38:24,300 --> 01:38:26,220
one good hope and um,

1486
01:38:27,420 --> 01:38:32,420
we talked most of the communities did
beautiful things that were involved in the

1487
01:38:33,691 --> 01:38:38,210
soup kitchens and tending the
homeless in projects, you know, um,

1488
01:38:38,520 --> 01:38:42,600
to support healing for
whether it was malaria.

1489
01:38:42,601 --> 01:38:46,500
Are there other diseases in different
other parts of the world and so forth.

1490
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:50,430
All kinds of great stuff.
And certainly meditation.

1491
01:38:51,420 --> 01:38:53,040
And when I got to talk,

1492
01:38:53,041 --> 01:38:57,360
which was kind of a summary talk toward,
uh,

1493
01:38:57,510 --> 01:38:59,070
toward the end of it,
um,

1494
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:03,660
I mentioned that in the historical record,

1495
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:05,360
whether it's true or not,

1496
01:39:05,361 --> 01:39:10,361
that the techs and so forth describe the
Buddha meeting with kings and princes

1497
01:39:10,831 --> 01:39:12,390
and ministers and so forth.

1498
01:39:12,391 --> 01:39:16,080
And probably if the Buddha were or around
now would go to the White House if you

1499
01:39:16,081 --> 01:39:20,160
were invited. He certainly would have bet
with Obama and who knows. And now, um,

1500
01:39:20,590 --> 01:39:23,730
Eh, end, he had advice about why society,

1501
01:39:24,750 --> 01:39:26,910
which he would give to
leaders and you'd say,

1502
01:39:27,120 --> 01:39:32,120
if you can train your people to meet
one another with respect to listen,

1503
01:39:34,290 --> 01:39:39,180
with respect to differences and to come
together peacefully listening to one

1504
01:39:39,181 --> 01:39:43,740
another and then, then you're pro
society will prosper and not decline.

1505
01:39:44,040 --> 01:39:48,480
And if your society tends to
the vulnerable among them, the,

1506
01:39:48,690 --> 01:39:51,210
the young people, the old
people, those who are sick,

1507
01:39:51,330 --> 01:39:53,070
it will prosper and not decline.

1508
01:39:53,070 --> 01:39:57,840
And if your society tends to the
environment around it in a healthy way,

1509
01:39:57,841 --> 01:40:02,010
it will prosper and not decline.
And so these are,

1510
01:40:02,130 --> 01:40:06,660
these are principles of compassion and
why society that you could read perhaps

1511
01:40:06,661 --> 01:40:10,800
in a number of great traditions from
the Iroquois nation or from the Taoist

1512
01:40:11,160 --> 01:40:15,660
sages. But here's the beautiful
piece. Yes, these are,

1513
01:40:15,780 --> 01:40:16,710
these are good things,

1514
01:40:16,711 --> 01:40:20,820
meeting and harmony and discussing and
harmony and being respectful for one

1515
01:40:20,821 --> 01:40:22,680
another and so forth.
Um,

1516
01:40:23,490 --> 01:40:28,490
there are practices that you can teach
and learn that develop this capacity so

1517
01:40:31,051 --> 01:40:34,740
that in our elementary schools now,
you know,

1518
01:40:34,741 --> 01:40:36,810
through organizations like castle,

1519
01:40:36,811 --> 01:40:41,430
which is a consortium for social and
emotional learning that's worked in,

1520
01:40:41,850 --> 01:40:44,160
you know, 10,000 schools. Um,

1521
01:40:44,460 --> 01:40:49,230
kids learn social and emotional learning.
They learn compassion,

1522
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:54,040
um, and it changes their lives.
They're better academically.

1523
01:40:54,330 --> 01:40:58,510
Um, and all these kids carry that,
you know, the troubles of our times.

1524
01:40:58,510 --> 01:41:02,210
They hear the news, they see the
trauma even in their own family. Um,

1525
01:41:02,440 --> 01:41:06,820
to teach you how to steward your own
hard, um, from when you're young.

1526
01:41:07,180 --> 01:41:10,690
And then these capacities are now
being incorporated as we know,

1527
01:41:10,691 --> 01:41:15,090
mindfulness based stress reduction in
clinics and hospitals in businesses in,

1528
01:41:15,400 --> 01:41:19,480
you know there's the mindfulness
teachers that for the,

1529
01:41:19,800 --> 01:41:24,800
when the Seattle Seahawks
won the championship or the
the Chicago Bulls in the

1530
01:41:26,350 --> 01:41:28,220
La Lakers when there were
championship teams, they had a,

1531
01:41:28,720 --> 01:41:31,750
they had a meditation coach, a
mindfulness coach, George Mumford,

1532
01:41:31,751 --> 01:41:36,751
a good friend that these capacities
can be learned wherever we are and they

1533
01:41:37,601 --> 01:41:39,010
transform our life.

1534
01:41:39,130 --> 01:41:42,700
It's not just by accident or that you
have this beautiful experience on the

1535
01:41:42,701 --> 01:41:44,710
mountains or making love,

1536
01:41:44,920 --> 01:41:49,630
but you can make that alive for you
through these trainings every day,

1537
01:41:49,810 --> 01:41:50,980
every part of your life.

1538
01:41:53,200 --> 01:41:57,310
Jack, there was a question I was
planning on asking at some point. Anyway,

1539
01:41:57,311 --> 01:41:59,560
and I think this is a good segue,

1540
01:41:59,561 --> 01:42:04,330
which is how can you get a busy person
hooked on my fullness practice and what

1541
01:42:04,331 --> 01:42:07,540
would be a first step or how to start
and since we're talking about loving

1542
01:42:07,541 --> 01:42:12,040
kindness, I would like to give a bit
of a hard sell for loving kindness.

1543
01:42:12,041 --> 01:42:15,700
Meditation is one option because I recall,

1544
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:17,350
perhaps it was two years ago,

1545
01:42:17,351 --> 01:42:21,370
I was really beating myself up and for
people who don't know this about me,

1546
01:42:21,590 --> 01:42:26,200
I've spent the majority of
my life being, uh, the, the,

1547
01:42:26,201 --> 01:42:31,020
my own worst enemy in terms of inner
dialogue and be extremely brutal and

1548
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:35,640
hypercritical and load
some of myself, uh, in,

1549
01:42:35,780 --> 01:42:37,300
in so many different respects.

1550
01:42:38,030 --> 01:42:42,460
And I was going through a particularly
intense and difficult time with that

1551
01:42:42,490 --> 01:42:46,420
inner critic, just ruthlessly,
uh, beating myself up.

1552
01:42:46,570 --> 01:42:50,740
And at that point, another
friend of mine, a shade Manc 10,

1553
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:55,000
who created the search inside yourself,
classic Google.

1554
01:42:55,001 --> 01:42:56,920
He was a very early engineer,

1555
01:42:57,460 --> 01:43:01,480
which became w the most oversubscribed
class for employees at Google,

1556
01:43:02,230 --> 01:43:05,490
uh, recommended that I take a look
at lovingkindness meditation and,

1557
01:43:05,491 --> 01:43:09,460
and I didn't have any particularly
sophisticated approach to it,

1558
01:43:09,790 --> 01:43:13,900
but I decided with nothing to lose and
that I was having so much trouble during

1559
01:43:13,901 --> 01:43:17,230
that period,
sitting still and trying to focus on say,

1560
01:43:17,231 --> 01:43:18,490
the breath or anything like that,

1561
01:43:19,330 --> 01:43:24,250
that at night this was happened to
coincide with book deadline. Probably, uh,

1562
01:43:24,310 --> 01:43:29,310
not pure coincidence that
my beating myself up was
exacerbated during that time.

1563
01:43:29,561 --> 01:43:33,220
That was a few years ago
and I began at night, uh,

1564
01:43:33,221 --> 01:43:38,200
in my case in a, when I would take
a shower at night or sit in a sauna,

1565
01:43:38,201 --> 01:43:40,450
I ha I very often go to hotels to write,

1566
01:43:40,451 --> 01:43:44,440
which is something Maya Angelou and a few
others that convinced me it might be a

1567
01:43:44,441 --> 01:43:48,760
good idea, uh, that I
would consider to people.

1568
01:43:48,820 --> 01:43:52,640
Just like you had mentioned two people
I really cared for and wish them well,

1569
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:58,280
that's all I did. And a shaded said to
me, Mang is usually what I would call him,

1570
01:43:58,730 --> 01:44:03,730
that at one point a woman in one of his
classes had done this for a one day at

1571
01:44:05,601 --> 01:44:07,520
work.
Every hour on the hour,

1572
01:44:07,521 --> 01:44:11,240
she would just look out of her office
and wish someone well that she could see

1573
01:44:11,241 --> 01:44:13,580
in our mind's eye for 60 seconds or so.
And she says,

1574
01:44:13,610 --> 01:44:16,100
she said it was her best
day of work in seven years.

1575
01:44:16,101 --> 01:44:18,830
And I found that unbelievable.
So I decided to try it myself.

1576
01:44:19,310 --> 01:44:24,310
And that week of just spending maybe two
to four minutes at night before going

1577
01:44:24,501 --> 01:44:29,360
to bed ended up being one
of the most blissful weeks,

1578
01:44:29,650 --> 01:44:32,450
uh, in memory. Certainly
at that point, uh,

1579
01:44:32,520 --> 01:44:36,500
in several years it was really profound
and I couldn't pick out any other

1580
01:44:36,501 --> 01:44:39,980
variable that had changed.
Uh, so for me, I just want to,

1581
01:44:39,981 --> 01:44:42,860
for people who are listening and saying,
ah, you know what, I'm type a driven,

1582
01:44:42,861 --> 01:44:44,150
super hyper competitor.

1583
01:44:44,390 --> 01:44:49,250
This doesn't apply to me that
it very well could apply to you.

1584
01:44:49,251 --> 01:44:54,140
And that by taking a little
bit of the harmful edge off,

1585
01:44:54,141 --> 01:44:58,700
you don't automatically remove your
competitive edge. Uh, and in fact,

1586
01:44:58,701 --> 01:45:02,540
I would argue just as you mentioned
that the bowls and so on used to have or

1587
01:45:02,541 --> 01:45:03,021
still do,

1588
01:45:03,021 --> 01:45:08,021
but you used to have a mindfulness coach
for competitive advantage that that it

1589
01:45:09,201 --> 01:45:13,640
can be another tool in your toolkit
and doesn't take you out of the game,

1590
01:45:13,641 --> 01:45:16,550
so to speak. It just makes you more
aware of the games that you're playing.

1591
01:45:16,580 --> 01:45:21,580
So that's a long sort of infomercial sales
pitch that I wanted to just make sure

1592
01:45:22,821 --> 01:45:24,380
I got in,
uh,

1593
01:45:24,410 --> 01:45:29,360
because I discounted a lot of these
practices for a very long time because I

1594
01:45:29,361 --> 01:45:34,040
thought it would at best be
a waste of time and at worse,

1595
01:45:34,670 --> 01:45:35,503
uh,

1596
01:45:35,860 --> 01:45:40,860
take away some of my skills or tendencies
that allowed me to get to where I am.

1597
01:45:42,080 --> 01:45:45,770
Um, so that, that, that is more
of a confessional than a question.

1598
01:45:45,771 --> 01:45:49,070
But I would love to hear your thoughts.
Any additional thoughts on,

1599
01:45:49,220 --> 01:45:53,750
on loving kindness meditation,
but also any additional thoughts on how,

1600
01:45:53,810 --> 01:45:56,790
if you wanted to get a, a busy, uh,

1601
01:45:56,840 --> 01:46:00,620
maybe even an impatient person
hooked on mindfulness practice,

1602
01:46:00,980 --> 01:46:03,980
what first steps or
approaches you might suggest?

1603
01:46:05,240 --> 01:46:05,940
Uh,

1604
01:46:05,940 --> 01:46:10,940
so a lot of different questions
sort of woven into what you said.

1605
01:46:11,300 --> 01:46:15,360
Um, and the first is that there's a kind
of misunderstanding in our culture that

1606
01:46:15,361 --> 01:46:20,250
love is a weakness and it's not,
there is a way in which,

1607
01:46:20,580 --> 01:46:25,020
um,
it's the force that can,

1608
01:46:25,470 --> 01:46:30,120
it probably the only force that can meet
the level of aggression or violence and

1609
01:46:30,390 --> 01:46:34,800
other such things that are happening.
And, um, you know, in the world, um,

1610
01:46:35,130 --> 01:46:38,730
it's the power that lets mothers
lift cars off their children,

1611
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:43,290
or it'll let somebody like Dr.
Martin Luther King Stand. Um,

1612
01:46:43,620 --> 01:46:47,640
you know, after his church was bombed
and children were killed and say,

1613
01:46:47,641 --> 01:46:51,540
we will meet your
violence with soul force.

1614
01:46:51,541 --> 01:46:52,650
We will not harm you,

1615
01:46:52,651 --> 01:46:56,940
but we will love you so deeply that
we will not only transform ourselves,

1616
01:46:56,941 --> 01:46:59,910
but we will transform you in the process.

1617
01:47:00,150 --> 01:47:03,670
And so the notion that love
is somehow a weakness, um,

1618
01:47:03,810 --> 01:47:07,890
I think we do everything out of love. We
want to be loved even in our, you know,

1619
01:47:08,070 --> 01:47:12,360
ambition and our desire for,
for success underneath it,

1620
01:47:12,710 --> 01:47:16,140
um, is, you know, we want
to be well, we want to be,

1621
01:47:16,141 --> 01:47:20,060
find our happiness and that's
part of part of love. So it's,

1622
01:47:20,100 --> 01:47:24,300
it's actually a power. And
my colleague and friend, um,

1623
01:47:24,620 --> 01:47:28,920
west Nessc or when to interview
Gary Snyder a couple of years ago,

1624
01:47:29,250 --> 01:47:33,040
Gary is a pure literary
prize winning poet, um,

1625
01:47:33,090 --> 01:47:37,440
and environmentalist for 50 years when
writing about bio regionalism and one of

1626
01:47:37,441 --> 01:47:42,441
our great kind of elders in
this environmental movement,

1627
01:47:42,541 --> 01:47:46,440
he said, Gary, what do you have to
say to us now that oceans are rising,

1628
01:47:46,441 --> 01:47:49,860
the world climate is changing,
you know,

1629
01:47:49,880 --> 01:47:54,060
the hotter and hotter the
species extinction. And Gary
looked back and he said,

1630
01:47:54,600 --> 01:47:57,960
don't feel guilty if
you're going to save it.

1631
01:47:58,410 --> 01:48:01,050
Don't save it out of
guilt or anger or fear.

1632
01:48:01,050 --> 01:48:05,880
Those are the very things that are
actually making the world worse. Save it.

1633
01:48:05,881 --> 01:48:09,930
Cause he would love it because it's
part of you because it, and that's the,

1634
01:48:09,990 --> 01:48:13,230
that is the, is the power. Um,

1635
01:48:13,710 --> 01:48:17,790
whether you're starting a company but
also it's not just that you, you know,

1636
01:48:17,791 --> 01:48:22,730
some vision, okay, now I'm going to
become this wealthy playboy or whatever,

1637
01:48:23,070 --> 01:48:25,110
you know, a Zillionaire, um,

1638
01:48:25,530 --> 01:48:29,850
that what is your life mean for
you and what do you really want?

1639
01:48:30,240 --> 01:48:34,110
And when you listen, there is something
in you and it's part of your birthright,

1640
01:48:34,330 --> 01:48:35,010
um,

1641
01:48:35,010 --> 01:48:40,010
to both be able to give your gifts but
also to love and be loved in return.

1642
01:48:40,171 --> 01:48:45,030
And it's turns out that it's a power.
So then what you're talking about is that,

1643
01:48:45,330 --> 01:48:50,010
um, it doesn't take much to begin
the training and you're, you know,

1644
01:48:50,011 --> 01:48:54,570
two minutes or four minutes in the evening
or this woman at her work taking once

1645
01:48:54,571 --> 01:48:55,620
an hour,
you know,

1646
01:48:55,650 --> 01:49:00,650
30 seconds or a minute to look at somebody
there and offer a well-wishing can

1647
01:49:03,451 --> 01:49:06,020
transform everything.
Um,

1648
01:49:06,150 --> 01:49:10,770
for people who want the practical support
because it is hard to do on your own

1649
01:49:11,070 --> 01:49:14,830
if you go to sounds true.com and look up,
um,

1650
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:17,370
the programs that I have first,

1651
01:49:17,371 --> 01:49:20,370
there's a 40 day program
called mindfulness daily,

1652
01:49:20,580 --> 01:49:25,580
which is 15 minutes a day or 12 minutes
a day depending on the segment that both

1653
01:49:26,041 --> 01:49:30,660
gives instructions in mindfulness, loving
awareness and loving kindness practice.

1654
01:49:30,990 --> 01:49:35,820
Um, and it's 12 or 15 minutes a day
and by the end of those 40 days,

1655
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:40,040
you really have learned the inner
skills and then it builds up. There's,

1656
01:49:40,050 --> 01:49:42,510
and then a deeper training
called power of awareness.

1657
01:49:42,511 --> 01:49:46,380
And for those who are interested were
about to open an online teacher training

1658
01:49:46,381 --> 01:49:50,230
for people interested in mindful, um, in,

1659
01:49:50,231 --> 01:49:53,950
in passing along mindfulness and
loving kindness to others. Jack,

1660
01:49:53,951 --> 01:49:56,350
just to interject for one
second for people listening,

1661
01:49:56,440 --> 01:50:00,490
I will also link to all of these
resources in the show notes,

1662
01:50:00,520 --> 01:50:03,430
which you can find at tim.blog/podcast.

1663
01:50:03,790 --> 01:50:05,830
So you don't necessarily have
to remember all these things.

1664
01:50:05,831 --> 01:50:10,360
You can go to the URL and uh, we will
have direct links to these resources. Uh,

1665
01:50:10,390 --> 01:50:13,660
sorry to interrupt Jack just wanted to
mention that for people listening and

1666
01:50:13,661 --> 01:50:16,450
with it.
Then there is also of the programs there.

1667
01:50:16,451 --> 01:50:20,540
There's one called guided meditations.
That's, you know, a download.

1668
01:50:20,541 --> 01:50:24,030
It's like 10 bucks or something and
it has a loving kindness practice of

1669
01:50:24,031 --> 01:50:27,060
compassion, practice of
forgiveness practice. Um,

1670
01:50:27,310 --> 01:50:32,200
I think it may even have a joy practice,
uh, and and so forth. So you can,

1671
01:50:32,380 --> 01:50:36,580
and it's really helpful to have guided
meditations at first cause otherwise your

1672
01:50:36,581 --> 01:50:37,414
attention,

1673
01:50:37,630 --> 01:50:42,070
we have a very short attention
span in modern society.

1674
01:50:42,160 --> 01:50:45,250
Albert Einstein,
at least according to scientific American

1675
01:50:46,810 --> 01:50:50,710
said, if you can drive
safely while kissing a girl,

1676
01:50:51,100 --> 01:50:54,250
you're simply not giving the
kiss the attention it deserves.

1677
01:50:55,500 --> 01:51:00,500
And we are in this kind of multitasking
world with our devices and we've

1678
01:51:01,811 --> 01:51:04,060
forgotten how to tend to our own hearts.

1679
01:51:04,060 --> 01:51:09,060
We've forgotten how in some ways to
really be present for one another and more

1680
01:51:10,091 --> 01:51:11,650
importantly for our own life.

1681
01:51:12,070 --> 01:51:17,070
And so getting guided meditations
is tremendously helpful.

1682
01:51:17,530 --> 01:51:21,040
And doing these little mini practices
that you talk about one minute,

1683
01:51:21,041 --> 01:51:23,800
two minutes, several times a day, um,

1684
01:51:24,220 --> 01:51:28,960
can transform you now. Oh, I was
just going to mention to people also,

1685
01:51:28,961 --> 01:51:31,810
if you look at behavioral change,
if you look at Bj Fogg,

1686
01:51:32,230 --> 01:51:36,610
formerly of the persuasion laboratory
at Stanford, you look at Diet,

1687
01:51:36,690 --> 01:51:40,510
a dietary change, any
of these things, uh, do,

1688
01:51:40,540 --> 01:51:44,870
doing less than you think you're capable
of doing is a really good long term

1689
01:51:44,871 --> 01:51:49,871
strategy in terms of starting off rigging
the game so that you can win in the

1690
01:51:50,531 --> 01:51:54,250
beginning so that your pass fail
mark and your mind is a really,

1691
01:51:54,251 --> 01:51:58,840
really low hurdle. So I just wanted to
reiterate, guided, guided meditation.

1692
01:51:58,870 --> 01:52:02,410
Don't white knuckle in the beginning
I'd make it beautiful, easy as possible.

1693
01:52:02,890 --> 01:52:06,230
And that the same principle from
the, from the ancient, you know,

1694
01:52:06,350 --> 01:52:10,630
texts say that you start and
the easiest way for some people,

1695
01:52:11,050 --> 01:52:12,940
kindness for themselves seems impossible.

1696
01:52:12,941 --> 01:52:17,050
But then you pick a child you care about
or someone else or even when you do go

1697
01:52:17,051 --> 01:52:20,870
to yourself, you think of yourself
when you were an innocent child, um,

1698
01:52:20,950 --> 01:52:22,090
and wish yourself well.

1699
01:52:22,270 --> 01:52:27,270
The game is to do wear whatever
naturally opens the gateway.

1700
01:52:28,390 --> 01:52:30,700
Whatever's the easiest.
For some people it's their dog.

1701
01:52:30,730 --> 01:52:32,430
You'd come home and you know the,

1702
01:52:32,431 --> 01:52:36,760
the most nonjudgmental being in their
life wags its tail and loves you and it

1703
01:52:36,761 --> 01:52:39,220
doesn't care.
You know what's going on in your head.

1704
01:52:39,670 --> 01:52:44,670
So you take the avenue that most naturally
opens your heart and then you do this

1705
01:52:44,741 --> 01:52:48,380
just a little at a time as you said.
And it doesn't take long.

1706
01:52:48,680 --> 01:52:52,190
But the other thing that's important
is that sometimes as you do it,

1707
01:52:52,520 --> 01:52:57,520
it can actually display or show you
the hypercritical nature of your mind,

1708
01:52:59,151 --> 01:53:03,560
the shame that you
carry. Um, the, you know,

1709
01:53:03,680 --> 01:53:08,240
the self judgment or self loathing.
And so then you, then you say,

1710
01:53:08,241 --> 01:53:10,220
well what do you do then?
Or it brings,

1711
01:53:10,221 --> 01:53:15,221
it brings up its opposite is that's the
place that you just breathe and hold all

1712
01:53:15,261 --> 01:53:19,790
that stuff with kindness because this
is our humanity and we all have some of

1713
01:53:19,791 --> 01:53:20,420
that.

1714
01:53:20,420 --> 01:53:23,900
And the point isn't to get rid of it or
judge yourself for having it or try to

1715
01:53:23,901 --> 01:53:27,680
fix it. It's almost as if you put your
hand on your heart and you say, you know,

1716
01:53:28,010 --> 01:53:31,070
this is like mindful self
compassion of deep training.

1717
01:53:31,610 --> 01:53:36,500
This is part of the measure of
struggles that I've been given,

1718
01:53:36,501 --> 01:53:37,760
like every human being,

1719
01:53:38,130 --> 01:53:43,070
these things have tried to protect me
and now I can hold them with tenderness

1720
01:53:43,370 --> 01:53:46,490
and say, alright, you know, thank you,
but I don't need your help anymore.

1721
01:53:46,491 --> 01:53:49,010
I can be kind to myself. And, and, and,

1722
01:53:49,220 --> 01:53:53,990
and in that way you're not trying to
fix yourself or perfect yourself. Um,

1723
01:53:54,560 --> 01:53:58,870
if anything, you're trying to perfect
your love. This is Jack. I want to do, we

1724
01:53:58,890 --> 01:54:03,890
give you credit for help that you gave
me and also tactical advice that you gave

1725
01:54:05,521 --> 01:54:08,640
me during the 10 day silent retreat.
You give me a lot, but I want it,

1726
01:54:08,840 --> 01:54:11,010
I want to highlight one that's
related to what you just said.

1727
01:54:11,610 --> 01:54:14,160
I was going through a very,
very difficult time,

1728
01:54:14,161 --> 01:54:17,160
particularly a days seven,
eight,

1729
01:54:17,170 --> 01:54:19,920
nine and you,

1730
01:54:20,100 --> 01:54:24,990
you gave me the advice that you
just mentioned. And there's,

1731
01:54:24,991 --> 01:54:27,840
there's one component I want to
really underscore for people.

1732
01:54:27,841 --> 01:54:31,050
And that is when you're,
for instance,

1733
01:54:31,080 --> 01:54:35,310
trying to do loving kindness meditation
and instead you get the opposite or you

1734
01:54:35,311 --> 01:54:39,960
get this self ridicule,
uh, who are you to try it,

1735
01:54:39,990 --> 01:54:44,640
to meditate in this self indulgent way.
This is ridiculous.

1736
01:54:44,641 --> 01:54:49,530
Or this voice starts to pop up that is
angry or hateful, whatever it might be.

1737
01:54:50,070 --> 01:54:55,070
The process of not simply dismissing
it or fighting against it,

1738
01:54:56,820 --> 01:55:01,820
but recognizing it as a coping strategy
that helped you in the past in some way

1739
01:55:02,341 --> 01:55:05,790
that you developed. Because
in my case, you know,

1740
01:55:05,791 --> 01:55:10,530
the rage was a fuel that if I had without,

1741
01:55:10,531 --> 01:55:14,370
which I probably would never have left
long island where I had friends who later

1742
01:55:14,400 --> 01:55:16,730
overdosed on opiates and so on.
So it,

1743
01:55:16,760 --> 01:55:21,270
it was a gift in a way and the tool,
and as you said,

1744
01:55:21,510 --> 01:55:26,510
you can thank that response or that
part of yourself and then put it,

1745
01:55:29,100 --> 01:55:31,950
and I remember you
recommended even visualizing,

1746
01:55:31,951 --> 01:55:34,110
and please correct me if
I'm wrong or elaborate,

1747
01:55:34,111 --> 01:55:37,800
but visualize taking that part
of you that is a coping strategy,

1748
01:55:37,801 --> 01:55:42,000
thanking it and then putting
it say on a shelf, uh,

1749
01:55:42,030 --> 01:55:46,410
where you can use it later
if need be along with say,

1750
01:55:46,411 --> 01:55:49,400
other icons are figures who,
uh,

1751
01:55:49,650 --> 01:55:52,650
whether it's Buddha or other
that that you recognize as wise.

1752
01:55:53,010 --> 01:55:56,880
And then continuing with the meditation
so that thanking that part of yourself

1753
01:55:56,881 --> 01:56:00,210
for the function that it wants serve,
even if it is not serving you now,

1754
01:56:00,940 --> 01:56:05,940
was such a key insight for
me that then helped me to,

1755
01:56:07,190 --> 01:56:10,560
uh,
manage my internal states or,

1756
01:56:10,650 --> 01:56:15,510
or observe and appreciate my internal
states for the next several days where I

1757
01:56:15,511 --> 01:56:17,970
really felt like I was lost at that point.

1758
01:56:17,970 --> 01:56:21,180
So that was a really direct tool
that helped me tremendously.

1759
01:56:21,180 --> 01:56:22,410
Mostly.
Yeah.

1760
01:56:22,530 --> 01:56:27,530
Thank you for bringing it up because
it's so important for people when we come

1761
01:56:27,991 --> 01:56:32,430
to that hypercritical, shame.
Shame place. Um, we're,

1762
01:56:32,610 --> 01:56:36,130
we feel very vulnerable and we've
been identified with it. Um,

1763
01:56:36,150 --> 01:56:39,840
because you needed it. I needed
these things for survival. So,

1764
01:56:39,920 --> 01:56:42,030
and if you try to get rid of this stuff,

1765
01:56:42,270 --> 01:56:45,210
you just end up in a fruitless
battle against yourself.

1766
01:56:45,211 --> 01:56:48,000
And it's just more judgment.
So what you described with saying,

1767
01:56:48,210 --> 01:56:50,780
thank you for helping me survive.
I appreciate it.

1768
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:52,740
Let me put it on the shelf or the altar.

1769
01:56:52,741 --> 01:56:56,100
I'll put it in the lap of the
Buddha or whoever, you know,

1770
01:56:56,101 --> 01:56:59,820
the goddess of infinite compassion.
You hold it for me. If I need it,

1771
01:56:59,821 --> 01:57:04,380
I'll pull it back. Um, and that
sense that this isn't who you are,

1772
01:57:05,340 --> 01:57:08,460
it doesn't describe who you are.
It isn't who you are. It was,

1773
01:57:08,580 --> 01:57:13,410
it was a strategy because we're
vulnerable beings and you were tender as a

1774
01:57:13,411 --> 01:57:17,970
child, you know, and you had to make sure
you could survive. Thank you for that.

1775
01:57:18,180 --> 01:57:21,470
And now I have a different capacity.
Um,

1776
01:57:22,170 --> 01:57:26,190
and let me just talk about that capacity
a little bit because the capacity for

1777
01:57:26,191 --> 01:57:27,740
presence,
um,

1778
01:57:28,170 --> 01:57:32,960
and the great heart of compassion
that's said to be your birthright, um,

1779
01:57:33,480 --> 01:57:37,950
is a really mysterious thing.
Talk about identity. Um,

1780
01:57:38,610 --> 01:57:41,160
and when my,
um,

1781
01:57:42,060 --> 01:57:46,770
youngest brother's wife
Esta was dying of cancer,

1782
01:57:47,270 --> 01:57:48,103
um,

1783
01:57:48,720 --> 01:57:53,460
and she was just a beautiful being and
I spent quite a bit of time with her and

1784
01:57:53,461 --> 01:57:58,140
with my brother. Um, I had gone
home, she was close to dying.

1785
01:57:58,141 --> 01:58:01,860
I'd gone home to sleep and I want to
get up early in hurry back cause it was

1786
01:58:01,861 --> 01:58:06,330
very close and I, uh, got my car,

1787
01:58:06,630 --> 01:58:11,490
I had to stop the drug store to pick up
a prescription, um, hurriedly running,

1788
01:58:11,520 --> 01:58:14,160
you know,
dashing through the aisles and so forth.

1789
01:58:14,340 --> 01:58:19,340
And I'm at the checkout counter and all
of a sudden my whole body relaxed and I

1790
01:58:19,381 --> 01:58:21,300
thought, oh, Hesta died.

1791
01:58:21,920 --> 01:58:26,910
And I got out to the car and I called my
brother. I said, how's it going? He said,

1792
01:58:26,911 --> 01:58:31,520
oh, as to died a few minutes ago.
And I said, I know, you know,

1793
01:58:31,560 --> 01:58:36,450
I'll be there shortly. Um, and
we've all had these experiences.

1794
01:58:36,451 --> 01:58:37,590
If I ask in a room,

1795
01:58:37,591 --> 01:58:41,560
how many have had this particular kind
of where you knew someone died when they

1796
01:58:41,561 --> 01:58:46,450
died, you know, a quarter of the
hands will go up. Why is this?

1797
01:58:46,870 --> 01:58:50,680
It's because who we are is not this body.
We are,

1798
01:58:50,980 --> 01:58:55,090
we are the consciousness itself.
And so with all of these practices,

1799
01:58:55,330 --> 01:59:00,330
what they allow us to do is to step out
of what's called the small sense of self

1800
01:59:00,971 --> 01:59:04,210
or the body of fear
and reconnect with the,

1801
01:59:04,630 --> 01:59:09,250
with a field of connection,
interdependence of compassion.

1802
01:59:09,740 --> 01:59:14,470
Um, and to take our history and to
honor it, but not be bound by it.

1803
01:59:14,600 --> 01:59:19,060
One of my favorite stories
is a rum dos.

1804
01:59:19,150 --> 01:59:19,641
Again,

1805
01:59:19,641 --> 01:59:24,640
this wonderful spiritual teacher in the
early years when he came back from being

1806
01:59:24,641 --> 01:59:29,350
with his guru in India, uh,

1807
01:59:29,380 --> 01:59:33,430
he was sitting up there and teaching,

1808
01:59:34,090 --> 01:59:35,710
um,
you know,

1809
01:59:35,800 --> 01:59:40,800
devotional practices and
meditation practices and he
had a beard and white robes

1810
01:59:41,441 --> 01:59:42,280
and uh,
and,

1811
01:59:42,370 --> 01:59:47,370
and beads and you sort of in the guru
outfit and a woman in the front row raised

1812
01:59:47,921 --> 01:59:50,290
their hand and say, rob does
around us. Aren't you Jewish?

1813
01:59:50,291 --> 01:59:54,050
What's with this Hindu stuff? And Rhonda,
I said, well, yes I am actually. Yeah,

1814
01:59:54,051 --> 01:59:57,010
it was bar Mitzvah'd is as I was too.
Um,

1815
01:59:57,370 --> 02:00:01,840
and there are many things I love
about the Jewish spiritual tradition,

1816
02:00:02,110 --> 02:00:06,420
the generosity of it, the, the
Kabbalah. All did great. You know,

1817
02:00:06,560 --> 02:00:10,060
teachings on the many stages
in states of consciousness.

1818
02:00:10,061 --> 02:00:12,490
The Hasidic masters who
were like Zen Masters.

1819
02:00:12,910 --> 02:00:14,590
And then he paused and
looked at and he said,

1820
02:00:14,591 --> 02:00:18,850
but remember I'm only
Jewish on my parents' side.

1821
02:00:20,590 --> 02:00:23,290
And there is something both Whiti,
which he was,

1822
02:00:23,291 --> 02:00:28,291
but also profound about it because we
are not just our parental history or,

1823
02:00:31,841 --> 02:00:36,490
or the historical circumstances of this
place and body that we were born into.

1824
02:00:36,790 --> 02:00:40,600
And something in us knows this
so that when you look at the,

1825
02:00:40,601 --> 02:00:43,170
there's a wonderful book
that came out last year,

1826
02:00:43,180 --> 02:00:44,980
the year before called the book of Joy,

1827
02:00:45,370 --> 02:00:49,810
which was a conversation between
the Dalai Lama and Archbishop Tutu.

1828
02:00:50,050 --> 02:00:52,600
And both of them have marvelous laughs.

1829
02:00:52,660 --> 02:00:56,320
I think people go to hear the Dalai
Lama by the tens of thousands,

1830
02:00:56,560 --> 02:00:58,900
not just for the Tibetan teaching,

1831
02:00:58,901 --> 02:01:02,100
some of which are actually
hard to understand. Um,

1832
02:01:02,380 --> 02:01:05,800
or even the fact that he's this
Nobel prize winning, you know,

1833
02:01:06,610 --> 02:01:07,570
world figure.

1834
02:01:07,990 --> 02:01:12,580
I think people go to hear him laugh
that somebody who's carried so much

1835
02:01:13,030 --> 02:01:18,030
suffering from the loss of his country
where he can't return and the burning of

1836
02:01:18,701 --> 02:01:20,710
temples and texts and all of those things,

1837
02:01:21,070 --> 02:01:24,380
and he and two had a week together
when they were asked and to,

1838
02:01:24,520 --> 02:01:27,640
and this created this book,
how can you be joyful?

1839
02:01:27,640 --> 02:01:31,810
How can you laugh like this when you've
lived through apartheid and the death of

1840
02:01:31,811 --> 02:01:35,070
so many people around you?
And Dalai Lama,

1841
02:01:35,210 --> 02:01:39,290
they banter back and forth and like
brothers. And the Dalai Lama says,

1842
02:01:39,440 --> 02:01:41,540
so much has been taken from me.

1843
02:01:42,680 --> 02:01:44,900
He know they've taken our sacred texts,

1844
02:01:44,901 --> 02:01:49,250
they've taken our ability to make
prayers in public. They've taken,

1845
02:01:49,280 --> 02:01:51,980
you know, um, so much of our culture,

1846
02:01:52,130 --> 02:01:56,420
why should I let them take my
happiness? And then two, two,

1847
02:01:56,421 --> 02:02:00,510
starts to laugh and giggle and say, you
know, I've been through so much, um,

1848
02:02:00,620 --> 02:02:03,590
but I am not going to let
myself live in that place.

1849
02:02:03,800 --> 02:02:07,310
I'm going to let myself live in
that which affirms life and in a,

1850
02:02:07,311 --> 02:02:08,960
in a kind of profound,

1851
02:02:09,210 --> 02:02:12,950
a joy that we made it
that were still alive,

1852
02:02:12,951 --> 02:02:16,580
that we can contribute, that we can
be here in this beautiful earth.

1853
02:02:17,510 --> 02:02:22,040
And this shift of consciousness
is what's needed for the world.

1854
02:02:22,390 --> 02:02:24,950
Um, because we look honestly, um,

1855
02:02:25,640 --> 02:02:30,640
no amount of technology alone is going
to save us nano technology and space

1856
02:02:31,791 --> 02:02:35,870
technology and biotechnology and
worldwide web, Internet, computer,

1857
02:02:35,871 --> 02:02:40,871
a super computer technology is going to
stop continuing warfare and racism and

1858
02:02:42,470 --> 02:02:45,080
tribalism and environmental destruction.

1859
02:02:45,650 --> 02:02:50,650
Those are happening based on
consciousness of the human heart.

1860
02:02:51,530 --> 02:02:53,580
And so we are now, you know, these have,

1861
02:02:53,581 --> 02:02:58,581
you've made these enormous developments
outwardly where you have the Great

1862
02:02:58,610 --> 02:03:01,820
Library of Alexandria and your smartphone
in your pocket along with it million

1863
02:03:02,110 --> 02:03:06,860
cat you tubes or whatever. But
there it is, it's all in there.

1864
02:03:07,520 --> 02:03:08,740
And then,
um,

1865
02:03:11,270 --> 02:03:13,540
what we need is,
um,

1866
02:03:13,640 --> 02:03:18,290
collectively to develop a
transformation inwardly of,

1867
02:03:18,530 --> 02:03:23,530
of our inner life that is parallel to
this enormous outer transformation.

1868
02:03:24,660 --> 02:03:26,780
Um, and that's that, you know,

1869
02:03:26,781 --> 02:03:29,810
one of the chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of staff some years ago said,

1870
02:03:29,811 --> 02:03:33,680
we are a nation of nuclear
giants and ethical infants.

1871
02:03:34,300 --> 02:03:38,600
You know, you know how old, I don't
know how old humanity is, but it's time,

1872
02:03:38,630 --> 02:03:42,260
you know, um, it's time to
grow up. So, so that this,

1873
02:03:42,261 --> 02:03:45,920
this work that we're talking
about is both individual.

1874
02:03:46,340 --> 02:03:51,340
But as you learn to meet your own
life with greater understanding and

1875
02:03:52,041 --> 02:03:53,480
compassion,
um,

1876
02:03:53,930 --> 02:03:58,310
it empowers you to move through the world
in a different way and to help others

1877
02:03:58,550 --> 02:04:01,400
do the same.
And then you get the kind of joy of two,

1878
02:04:01,401 --> 02:04:05,030
two in the Dye Lama that you're
somehow part of an awakening.

1879
02:04:05,031 --> 02:04:07,520
That humanity now needs more than ever.

1880
02:04:08,740 --> 02:04:11,140
Jack,
I'd love to ask you,

1881
02:04:12,340 --> 02:04:16,960
these interviews are always
driven by some self interest.

1882
02:04:17,230 --> 02:04:19,960
I always have somebody issue or challenge
or problem that I'm trying to figure

1883
02:04:19,961 --> 02:04:22,360
out. So I reached out to someone
like you to help me do it.

1884
02:04:22,361 --> 02:04:25,980
But I record the conversation, uh, as,

1885
02:04:26,300 --> 02:04:29,140
as we chatted about before we hit
record, and you know, this already,

1886
02:04:29,141 --> 02:04:32,080
but the last several years have been very,

1887
02:04:32,081 --> 02:04:35,800
very important for me in terms
of addressing certain traumas.

1888
02:04:35,801 --> 02:04:36,880
In the last eight weeks in

1889
02:04:38,160 --> 02:04:41,070
have been transformative
and a lot of beautiful ways.

1890
02:04:42,090 --> 02:04:46,740
And the periods, the, the,

1891
02:04:46,920 --> 02:04:50,220
the duration of periods,
uh,

1892
02:04:51,120 --> 02:04:55,680
within which I don't berate or
attack myself have become longer.

1893
02:04:56,100 --> 02:05:00,750
But there are still times when
the wheels fly off the car.

1894
02:05:00,780 --> 02:05:05,400
And this last week has been one
such example. Uh, and I tend to,

1895
02:05:05,790 --> 02:05:10,380
when I make a mistake or feel like I'm
backsliding or relapsing to compound the

1896
02:05:10,381 --> 02:05:13,170
problem by beating myself up,
which then I start to,

1897
02:05:13,350 --> 02:05:16,470
then I beat myself up about beating
myself up. And you know where that goes.

1898
02:05:16,920 --> 02:05:18,970
So let me paint a picture.
So I,

1899
02:05:19,010 --> 02:05:24,010
I found out recently that
my Japanese host father,

1900
02:05:24,330 --> 02:05:27,390
and I've been in touch with this
family since I was 15. I'm very,

1901
02:05:27,391 --> 02:05:32,250
very close to them, 40 now. And I
found out that he just was admitted,

1902
02:05:32,520 --> 02:05:32,780
uh,

1903
02:05:32,780 --> 02:05:37,380
because of the host mother sent me an
email to the hospital with liver cancer.

1904
02:05:37,590 --> 02:05:41,580
And, and this there, they
don't have the details yet.

1905
02:05:41,581 --> 02:05:45,660
I just sent a followup email. They don't
know what the prognosis is exactly, but,

1906
02:05:46,060 --> 02:05:50,200
uh, needless to say, the
worst case scenarios are,

1907
02:05:50,201 --> 02:05:55,201
are certainly being conjured in my mind
or the potential of those and then,

1908
02:05:55,800 --> 02:05:58,680
uh,
simultaneously have been contending with.

1909
02:05:59,370 --> 02:06:02,830
And I believe you have some
experience with this, uh,

1910
02:06:02,910 --> 02:06:07,910
contending with a what should be a very
simple construction project of a cabin

1911
02:06:10,140 --> 02:06:12,720
up in the mountains. Uh, and it is,

1912
02:06:13,140 --> 02:06:16,930
it has been delayed and delayed and
delayed and there've been cost overruns in

1913
02:06:16,950 --> 02:06:21,210
cost over in cost overruns
and his promises made
promises, broken expectations,

1914
02:06:21,211 --> 02:06:22,590
set expectations missed.

1915
02:06:23,310 --> 02:06:28,260
And a friend of mine called with a whole
new slew of problems yesterday related

1916
02:06:28,261 --> 02:06:32,010
to this place. And I lost my shit, for
lack of a better term. I mean there,

1917
02:06:32,011 --> 02:06:34,050
there are many other things
going on simultaneously.

1918
02:06:34,050 --> 02:06:35,940
But I got really pissed and I was like,
you know what,

1919
02:06:36,630 --> 02:06:38,100
this extending the olive branch,

1920
02:06:38,110 --> 02:06:42,090
being understanding can't gambit is
not working with these people. Like I,

1921
02:06:42,190 --> 02:06:43,380
I need to,
I need to,

1922
02:06:43,410 --> 02:06:47,580
I need to take out the baseball bat and
like pull old Tim off the shelf who was

1923
02:06:47,581 --> 02:06:51,390
just this like juggernaut
head through brick walls and
be like, listen, fuck face.

1924
02:06:51,391 --> 02:06:55,140
Like if you don't do a, B,
c, d and e here, these are
going to be the consequences.

1925
02:06:55,560 --> 02:06:58,560
And then I'm like, well wait,
I'm supposed to be compassionate,

1926
02:06:58,561 --> 02:07:00,210
but how do I not be a pushover?

1927
02:07:00,720 --> 02:07:05,720
And it turns into this big dramatic
play inside my head and then I wait,

1928
02:07:05,820 --> 02:07:08,280
then this is going to end soon.
I'm not going to keep going.

1929
02:07:08,281 --> 02:07:12,990
But what I then often do is
self medicate with caffeine.

1930
02:07:13,410 --> 02:07:18,210
And I think it's a way of
feeling productive without
actually being productive.

1931
02:07:18,211 --> 02:07:21,990
And it also creates so
much volume on the noise.

1932
02:07:21,991 --> 02:07:26,730
I think I use it to tune
out a lot of feelings. Uh,

1933
02:07:26,790 --> 02:07:31,790
so when someone relapses or
has this kind of experience,

1934
02:07:32,640 --> 02:07:36,100
what do you suggest to them?
I mean, is there, uh, is

1935
02:07:36,100 --> 02:07:41,100
there a particular pattern interrupt or
approach that you've found helpful for

1936
02:07:41,891 --> 02:07:46,330
regaining footing? Oh, so there's
a number of things to say.

1937
02:07:46,720 --> 02:07:51,060
Um, yeah. First of all, um,

1938
02:07:51,220 --> 02:07:55,630
you could call it relapsing or you could
just call it like, yeah. Is being human.

1939
02:07:58,300 --> 02:07:59,110
One of the Po,

1940
02:07:59,110 --> 02:08:03,760
the most most beloved poet in Japan
was a zen master named Rio Kahn.

1941
02:08:04,300 --> 02:08:09,300
And there's a two line verse that of
his that I particularly find fitting for

1942
02:08:10,721 --> 02:08:15,430
this where he wrote last year
of foolish monk this year.

1943
02:08:15,730 --> 02:08:17,620
No change.
You know,

1944
02:08:18,220 --> 02:08:23,130
and you can sort of feel the
humor and the tenderness. Um, and,

1945
02:08:23,150 --> 02:08:26,650
and there's a way in which you see
your personality, that point, you know,

1946
02:08:26,651 --> 02:08:29,710
you have a body and you
have this particular body
you're born with and you can

1947
02:08:29,711 --> 02:08:33,940
transform it in certain ways within the
limits of the body that you were given.

1948
02:08:34,330 --> 02:08:37,570
Um,
and similarly have a personality.

1949
02:08:37,570 --> 02:08:41,230
And anybody who has a number
of kids realizes that you
don't come in Tabula Rasa,

1950
02:08:41,231 --> 02:08:44,470
that you actually, this kid is born.
It has this kind of temperament.

1951
02:08:44,830 --> 02:08:48,350
So we have a personality and just like
you don't want to look too closely to the

1952
02:08:48,351 --> 02:08:51,270
Bot at the body. Sometimes you
don't want to look back closely.

1953
02:08:51,280 --> 02:08:53,380
The personality either. Um, you know,

1954
02:08:53,381 --> 02:08:57,430
it has its foibles and its fears
and you know, all of that. Um,

1955
02:08:57,460 --> 02:09:00,130
and so you start to kind
of look at it and say, oh,

1956
02:09:00,131 --> 02:09:04,880
now there's a really good example of how
neurotic I can get. Thank you. Thank you.

1957
02:09:04,881 --> 02:09:06,790
I'm pretty sure reminding me,
you know,

1958
02:09:06,940 --> 02:09:09,670
and then you get a little sort
of like the keeper of the zoo,

1959
02:09:09,671 --> 02:09:14,550
a little more tender with this,
those kinds of creatures. So that's,

1960
02:09:14,551 --> 02:09:17,860
that's it's bringing in the nonjudgment,
you know,

1961
02:09:18,200 --> 02:09:23,200
or loving kindness for the way that
you actually are and not your ideal.

1962
02:09:23,470 --> 02:09:26,050
Um, or bringing compassion,
you could say, yeah,

1963
02:09:26,200 --> 02:09:29,560
this is a tough one in this triggered,
I get triggered. So what? Um,

1964
02:09:29,800 --> 02:09:34,800
now the other thing is if I have the
same experience when we had a big remodel

1965
02:09:35,231 --> 02:09:39,640
of our house when I was some years ago,
um,

1966
02:09:39,800 --> 02:09:41,620
and raising my daughter and,

1967
02:09:41,710 --> 02:09:46,180
and in my first marriage and we were
supposed to go and teach and travel in

1968
02:09:46,181 --> 02:09:49,270
Europe and this guy who was a
good contractor, but you know,

1969
02:09:49,271 --> 02:09:51,190
everything of course gets
more expensive and you know,

1970
02:09:51,270 --> 02:09:54,580
news and it just kept getting
slowed down and I said,

1971
02:09:54,581 --> 02:09:57,310
you weren't going to get this done so
we could make these decision for went to

1972
02:09:57,311 --> 02:09:59,860
Europe and it's not happening.
You've got to hurry up.

1973
02:10:00,130 --> 02:10:02,920
I do that like three or four
different times and it doesn't happen.

1974
02:10:03,280 --> 02:10:07,420
Finally I go in, I get
pissed and I say, listen,

1975
02:10:07,960 --> 02:10:10,310
you know,
you said this in our contract,

1976
02:10:10,311 --> 02:10:13,690
it was going to be done by and if you
don't fucking get this done by the time of

1977
02:10:13,690 --> 02:10:13,691
day,

1978
02:10:13,691 --> 02:10:18,400
I'm going to haul your ass in court and
sue you because I need this done and I'm

1979
02:10:18,401 --> 02:10:22,390
not going to pay you that God damn money.
Oh. He looked at me and he said, Oh,

1980
02:10:22,391 --> 02:10:27,040
you really want this done, don't you? I
said, yes. Next day there's a huge crew.

1981
02:10:27,041 --> 02:10:29,500
It starts to compound
that. I realized, okay,

1982
02:10:30,070 --> 02:10:34,400
what I've been sort of talking
meditation speak Nice, get it done.

1983
02:10:34,670 --> 02:10:37,790
He was a fucking contractor
and I decided to keep,

1984
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,310
I had to speak contractor ease,

1985
02:10:40,520 --> 02:10:45,290
get the God damn job done or I'll haul
your ass. Oh, okay. I got it. Yeah, I'll,

1986
02:10:45,291 --> 02:10:47,600
I'll send a team over.
And that's all it took.

1987
02:10:47,930 --> 02:10:52,550
So there's something playful about
that as well. It's not that you can't,

1988
02:10:52,890 --> 02:10:55,460
I've seen the Dalai Lama
get angry at people.

1989
02:10:55,670 --> 02:11:00,140
It's not that you can't use that
power and that understanding,

1990
02:11:00,440 --> 02:11:01,730
um,
you know,

1991
02:11:01,820 --> 02:11:06,500
when it's necessary to get to
the very strong or forceful, um,

1992
02:11:06,950 --> 02:11:09,770
uh, and you don't have to judge
yourself unless you hurt people.

1993
02:11:09,771 --> 02:11:13,730
And then of course, that's the
misuse of it. Um, but it's just,

1994
02:11:13,731 --> 02:11:16,050
it's part of being human.
Um,

1995
02:11:16,620 --> 02:11:20,790
is there, so you say to
yourself when, no, I think,

1996
02:11:21,930 --> 02:11:25,910
I don't know. You are, uh,
certainly in person and any,

1997
02:11:25,950 --> 02:11:28,350
with any contact I've had of you with you.

1998
02:11:29,220 --> 02:11:33,870
One of the most compassionate
people I've ever met. And I, I,

1999
02:11:33,970 --> 02:11:36,270
I've, I don't use that
word very much, but your,

2000
02:11:37,070 --> 02:11:42,070
your presence of listening and being
with someone is really incredible.

2001
02:11:42,530 --> 02:11:47,040
Uh, and I don't know how much of that
is an in intrinsic versus trained,

2002
02:11:47,070 --> 02:11:51,270
but for better or for worse,
you're coming out of the womb.

2003
02:11:51,300 --> 02:11:55,860
I've been very, uh,
impatient since day one,

2004
02:11:56,370 --> 02:12:00,590
so I worry about,
I can get my,

2005
02:12:00,660 --> 02:12:05,430
it seems like my default is the yell is,
is speaking contractor ease to,

2006
02:12:06,300 --> 02:12:08,460
uh,
more than just the

2007
02:12:10,040 --> 02:12:14,100
way the wayward contractor who's,
uh, who's putting off work.

2008
02:12:14,760 --> 02:12:15,930
Is there some,

2009
02:12:16,020 --> 02:12:21,020
when I feel that the sensations
of anger beginning to bubble up,

2010
02:12:21,690 --> 02:12:26,690
is there something that you would
suggest as self talk or just a temporary

2011
02:12:27,391 --> 02:12:28,890
pumping of the brakes to

2012
02:12:30,690 --> 02:12:34,110
make it an informed decision
versus just a lashing out?

2013
02:12:37,800 --> 02:12:39,540
Well, um, I could give you an answer,

2014
02:12:39,541 --> 02:12:43,830
but in a minute I'm going to guide you
in a little practice so that you can find

2015
02:12:43,831 --> 02:12:48,090
the, find the better answer.
First I just want to say that, um,

2016
02:12:48,720 --> 02:12:52,590
that anger, you know, yes, it's your
habit or maybe your temperament,

2017
02:12:52,950 --> 02:12:56,710
that's energy. And there's nothing
wrong with energy. You know, it's,

2018
02:12:56,711 --> 02:12:58,870
it's the power of that.
Let you do all the kinds of things you've,

2019
02:12:58,880 --> 02:13:01,590
you've done in your life that
are tremendously, you know,

2020
02:13:01,830 --> 02:13:05,790
creative or resourceful or daring
or whatever kinds of things.

2021
02:13:06,030 --> 02:13:10,920
So you want to respect, okay, I'm getting
filled with energy and you might be,

2022
02:13:10,921 --> 02:13:14,940
then you want to lash out. But first
you want to respect that energy. Wow,

2023
02:13:15,060 --> 02:13:18,930
let me feel this in my buddy who
anger, how big is it? Woo. Okay,

2024
02:13:19,290 --> 02:13:23,970
then your question is then your question
is, what can I do to modulate it?

2025
02:13:23,970 --> 02:13:27,450
I could give you, you know, okay,
take some breaths, ground yourself,

2026
02:13:27,690 --> 02:13:32,160
look at that other person
number, blah, blah, blah. But
instead, as we were talking,

2027
02:13:32,700 --> 02:13:34,790
um, let yourself, um,

2028
02:13:36,690 --> 02:13:41,100
picture a circumstance recently, it
might've been with your, you know,

2029
02:13:41,101 --> 02:13:44,860
the contractor is doing your cabin or
something else and you're, you know,

2030
02:13:44,880 --> 02:13:47,350
that uprising of,
um,

2031
02:13:48,090 --> 02:13:51,930
the injustice of it and how right you are,
you know,

2032
02:13:51,931 --> 02:13:55,230
and how you're going to get this
goddamn thing done. You know,

2033
02:13:55,231 --> 02:13:57,750
and how you have to have
to be hard and strong.

2034
02:13:57,751 --> 02:14:00,270
You feel all of that and feel
that energy in your body.

2035
02:14:00,480 --> 02:14:04,500
First thing is just remember what it
felt like. And now you're becoming the,

2036
02:14:04,740 --> 02:14:08,310
the kind of mindful loving
witness of it and saying, wow,

2037
02:14:08,490 --> 02:14:12,960
this is a lot of energy. Can you
feel that? And remember that?

2038
02:14:14,670 --> 02:14:19,260
Okay. Now, next step, um, is that,

2039
02:14:19,290 --> 02:14:23,370
um, the wisest, you know,
figure you can imagine,

2040
02:14:23,371 --> 02:14:27,090
maybe it's the Buddha or, or maybe
it's, I don't know. It doesn't,

2041
02:14:27,310 --> 02:14:31,500
it doesn't matter. Some great master
martial arts master, you know,

2042
02:14:31,770 --> 02:14:34,090
who's mastered themselves
as well as their are,

2043
02:14:34,100 --> 02:14:39,100
comes to you and let yourself imagine
somebody who's going to teach you how to

2044
02:14:39,840 --> 02:14:44,840
manage this powerful energy
and see who appears,

2045
02:14:44,850 --> 02:14:47,610
somebody appears to you.
Um,

2046
02:14:47,880 --> 02:14:52,350
and first they look at you and they smile
and then they say, yeah, this is really,

2047
02:14:52,351 --> 02:14:56,790
this is the big energy. Um, and they
appreciate you. So instead of saying, Oh,

2048
02:14:56,791 --> 02:15:00,120
you're a doofus, you know, they
say, Oh yeah, you actually,

2049
02:15:00,210 --> 02:15:02,340
you actually carry some powerful energy.

2050
02:15:02,341 --> 02:15:06,550
And they acknowledged that they bow to
you. Yeah, Tim, you got it all right.

2051
02:15:07,170 --> 02:15:10,890
And then you say, yeah, but how do
I manage this when it takes me over?

2052
02:15:12,030 --> 02:15:14,520
And so this zen master,
whoever comes,

2053
02:15:14,730 --> 02:15:19,730
reaches under their robe and
pulls out a gift for you,

2054
02:15:20,880 --> 02:15:25,880
which is a clear symbol of exactly what
you need in that moment to help you

2055
02:15:27,031 --> 02:15:29,460
regulate it so that you
can keep the energy,

2056
02:15:29,610 --> 02:15:32,430
but doing it in a way that doesn't
cause harm to you or another.

2057
02:15:32,700 --> 02:15:36,210
And this clear symbol you'll be able
to see, to adjust what you need.

2058
02:15:36,660 --> 02:15:40,950
So let yourself picture the gift that
they put in your hand and let yourself

2059
02:15:40,951 --> 02:15:45,000
imagine. See, envision,
picture what it, what it is.

2060
02:15:46,620 --> 02:15:51,450
And if you can't see it clearly hold it
up to the sunlight, you'll be able to,

2061
02:15:51,750 --> 02:15:56,100
and then let me know what
you get. You want me to tell
you what it is? Yeah, yeah.

2062
02:15:56,280 --> 02:16:00,470
All right. So the person who came to
mind for me, I went through a few,

2063
02:16:00,980 --> 02:16:05,800
was the creator of judo.
Fascinating guy named Gigo Takano.

2064
02:16:05,900 --> 02:16:09,350
Really smoke a small guy, uh, who

2065
02:16:09,750 --> 02:16:13,780
yes. Who could, who could
throw all the big guys and
smile at the same time. Right,

2066
02:16:13,920 --> 02:16:18,080
exactly. Changed a lot also in Japanese
government. Fascinating guy. The,

2067
02:16:18,390 --> 02:16:22,590
the symbol,
I don't know why this is to be honest,

2068
02:16:22,591 --> 02:16:23,710
but it's a

2069
02:16:25,440 --> 02:16:28,080
pyramid the size with,
with,

2070
02:16:28,110 --> 02:16:32,560
with straight edges about little
too big to holding your palm.

2071
02:16:32,650 --> 02:16:36,550
That is uh, uh, blue.

2072
02:16:36,730 --> 02:16:41,560
It's like a sort of, almost a, a
mixture of Scott pure sky blue,

2073
02:16:41,561 --> 02:16:46,561
like a blue bird blue with a bit of
electric blue mixed in and it's sort of a,

2074
02:16:49,030 --> 02:16:54,030
a smoky vapor that's floating
around inside this glass pyramid.

2075
02:16:54,671 --> 02:16:57,160
I don't, I have no idea why that's
the case, but that's what came up.

2076
02:16:57,780 --> 02:17:00,260
All right. So we'll stay with it. And
then there's one more little piece.

2077
02:17:00,500 --> 02:17:03,800
So he gives you this, this pyramid, um,

2078
02:17:05,150 --> 02:17:10,150
free associate a little bit on what it
might possibly mean cause the assembles

2079
02:17:10,731 --> 02:17:14,600
or like dream images and they have, they
come from a deep place in your psyche.

2080
02:17:15,110 --> 02:17:18,830
And this pyramid has a message for you.
This blue pyramid.

2081
02:17:19,160 --> 02:17:20,870
Just guess what it might be.

2082
02:17:21,690 --> 02:17:26,640
I think it's very, very stable. Uh,
it's an extremely stable structure.

2083
02:17:27,540 --> 02:17:31,500
And uh,
for me it also,

2084
02:17:33,390 --> 02:17:36,060
I could imagine it
representing power also.

2085
02:17:36,061 --> 02:17:40,800
It seems like a very powerful symbol in
many different cultures. Certainly. Yup.

2086
02:17:41,040 --> 02:17:45,630
Uh, the blue, the blue is
a little easier for me.

2087
02:17:45,660 --> 02:17:49,760
It's a very cooling,
soothing color where, uh,

2088
02:17:49,860 --> 02:17:54,600
certainly red is the,
the Colorado CCA with a fire with the,

2089
02:17:55,650 --> 02:17:57,760
the uh, hi, uh,

2090
02:17:57,930 --> 02:18:02,930
a resonance anger energy would
be more of a red fire element.

2091
02:18:03,320 --> 02:18:04,940
Uh,
so the blue would be a,

2092
02:18:05,040 --> 02:18:09,000
a cooling or countering
balancing force for that.

2093
02:18:09,630 --> 02:18:10,071
All right.

2094
02:18:10,071 --> 02:18:15,071
So now what I want you to do is
imagine taking this blue pyramid gift,

2095
02:18:15,770 --> 02:18:20,570
which represents a kind
of extreme stability, um,

2096
02:18:20,630 --> 02:18:25,580
and also a kind of power and cooling
that's given to you by Jugaad Oconto and

2097
02:18:25,581 --> 02:18:30,080
taking this into your body so that there
you are filled with this energy and

2098
02:18:30,081 --> 02:18:33,400
anger. You know, this huge wave of, um,

2099
02:18:34,040 --> 02:18:39,040
you let that be there and you take this
pyramid in and you let that energy be

2100
02:18:39,771 --> 02:18:41,930
inside this stable,

2101
02:18:41,931 --> 02:18:46,931
grounded place of power and feel what
it's like to be inside this blue pyramid

2102
02:18:48,951 --> 02:18:52,280
with this energy and feel how
it feel, how to, it affects it.

2103
02:18:52,560 --> 02:18:55,550
Just notice as if they're,
you're in that circumstance.

2104
02:18:55,551 --> 02:18:59,390
And now I'm remembering I am
the blue pyramid with the,

2105
02:18:59,870 --> 02:19:02,390
and what do you, you know,
what does it feel like

2106
02:19:03,480 --> 02:19:08,040
wife, the Ma, the most noticeable
thing. And uh, you know,

2107
02:19:08,070 --> 02:19:09,900
I wonder of course how
much of this is the,

2108
02:19:10,050 --> 02:19:15,050
the actual visualization versus the
timeout I permit myself to have,

2109
02:19:15,871 --> 02:19:16,704
but others,

2110
02:19:16,740 --> 02:19:20,940
there's very often a tightness
on the left side of my chest,

2111
02:19:20,941 --> 02:19:21,774
right by the sternum.

2112
02:19:22,480 --> 02:19:26,220
And I feel when I start
getting a wound up.

2113
02:19:26,590 --> 02:19:31,590
And that is absent when after taking
this gift and then visualizing it being

2114
02:19:35,391 --> 02:19:36,224
incorporated.

2115
02:19:36,840 --> 02:19:39,990
So that dissipates while you're
practicing and you know, and,

2116
02:19:40,010 --> 02:19:43,440
and you know this very well in
athletics, that yes, you practice things,

2117
02:19:43,590 --> 02:19:46,890
but other times you also practice
envisioning whether it's playing piano or

2118
02:19:46,891 --> 02:19:48,150
whether it's, you know, some,

2119
02:19:48,450 --> 02:19:52,450
some Olympic training that some
of the times you just do it, um,

2120
02:19:52,770 --> 02:19:56,490
in through visualization and it activates
a lot of the same neural circuitry.

2121
02:19:56,760 --> 02:20:01,140
So here you're starting to get the feeling
of what it's like to be in the middle

2122
02:20:01,141 --> 02:20:05,100
of this upwelling of anger and so forth.

2123
02:20:05,370 --> 02:20:09,960
And then taking a couple of breaths
and feeling the Blue Pyramid and the

2124
02:20:09,961 --> 02:20:14,961
connection with the earth and the
stability of it and the power then of that

2125
02:20:16,020 --> 02:20:21,020
presence that cools you and allows the
anger to be there but not in the same

2126
02:20:21,450 --> 02:20:22,770
uncontrolled way.

2127
02:20:23,310 --> 02:20:27,540
Now there's one more thing and
that is if you imagine again,

2128
02:20:28,040 --> 02:20:32,130
you got Oakano, I believe you
said his name is, he comes,

2129
02:20:32,131 --> 02:20:36,330
he comes up to you after
giving you this gift.

2130
02:20:36,870 --> 02:20:41,870
And he touches you kindly on the shoulder
and he has a few words of advice of

2131
02:20:42,121 --> 02:20:46,260
how to handle this powerful energy that
comes up in you because he knows all

2132
02:20:46,261 --> 02:20:47,094
about it.

2133
02:20:47,280 --> 02:20:51,420
And what does he whisper
into your ear constantly?

2134
02:20:52,240 --> 02:20:56,160
Well, he whispers this, this,
this came to mind immediately.

2135
02:20:57,470 --> 02:21:01,460
He, he says zen, you'll
cuisine y'all, which is,

2136
02:21:02,450 --> 02:21:05,990
uh, you know, I, I still
have this actually there too.

2137
02:21:06,860 --> 02:21:09,800
He has many famous quotes, but he, he has,

2138
02:21:09,990 --> 02:21:14,150
you might consider proverbs
short aphorisms that I,

2139
02:21:14,180 --> 02:21:17,030
I've actually carried with me
since I was 15, but they're packed.

2140
02:21:17,390 --> 02:21:21,530
They're packed away somewhere. I
have two of them are on cloth. Uh,

2141
02:21:21,710 --> 02:21:24,470
and the,

2142
02:21:24,860 --> 02:21:28,310
the firstest stomata but still made a
bot cannot have the thoughts though.

2143
02:21:28,311 --> 02:21:32,420
It's means basically if you, if
you work hard, you will achieve,

2144
02:21:32,421 --> 02:21:35,900
you will reach your, your target.
It's not the best translation,

2145
02:21:35,901 --> 02:21:38,930
but that's the idea. The other
one is then New York was in your,

2146
02:21:38,931 --> 02:21:43,931
which is effectively the
most efficient use of energy.

2147
02:21:44,361 --> 02:21:49,130
But it could also be the, the best
slash most benevolent use of energy.

2148
02:21:49,430 --> 02:21:52,010
And it's,
it's a principle of judo,

2149
02:21:52,011 --> 02:21:55,240
but it's something that he
applied to everything, uh,

2150
02:21:55,250 --> 02:21:56,810
includes including education.

2151
02:21:56,930 --> 02:22:01,520
So it would be that very
short bite sized aphorism,

2152
02:22:01,521 --> 02:22:04,790
which is a, and I'm sure some
scholars probably disagree with me,

2153
02:22:04,791 --> 02:22:08,450
but roughly translated
here at least as I take it,

2154
02:22:08,480 --> 02:22:13,430
is the maximum or most
efficient use of energy.

2155
02:22:14,340 --> 02:22:19,050
So take that in, take his, his
intention zones and Yoko's annual,

2156
02:22:19,590 --> 02:22:24,240
um, the benevolent and efficient use
of it. Feel that pyramid. And now,

2157
02:22:24,500 --> 02:22:28,260
um, you were assigned,
is that the next, um,

2158
02:22:28,560 --> 02:22:31,650
five times that this comes with your will,

2159
02:22:31,651 --> 02:22:35,940
maybe tomorrow or next week or so forth,
bringing in the blue pyramids, stable,

2160
02:22:36,090 --> 02:22:38,880
powerful cooling.
So the energy is still there.

2161
02:22:38,970 --> 02:22:42,780
And then you hear his voice ses and
you'll go [inaudible] and you go, oh yeah,

2162
02:22:42,781 --> 02:22:46,800
I can use this, but I can use
it in a benevolent way, um,

2163
02:22:46,980 --> 02:22:51,390
and try it five times and
then then, um, text me,

2164
02:22:51,600 --> 02:22:54,630
let me know what happened because of that.
We're closing the loop.

2165
02:22:54,660 --> 02:22:57,750
If you do it and see now you're,
now you're responsible.

2166
02:22:57,751 --> 02:23:00,420
If you've agreed that you're going
to do it, it's sort of goose.

2167
02:23:00,510 --> 02:23:02,470
It gooses the game a little bit.
You Go,

2168
02:23:02,471 --> 02:23:05,550
okay now I better do it cause I have
to let Jack know where we know what

2169
02:23:05,551 --> 02:23:08,600
happened and let me know what happened.
Well I'll be able to do,

2170
02:23:08,900 --> 02:23:12,860
be able to use it this week cause I'm
flying out to the site of this cabin to

2171
02:23:12,861 --> 02:23:14,000
meet with everybody and see what,

2172
02:23:14,570 --> 02:23:18,380
so I'll, I'll have at least
five opportunities to do that.

2173
02:23:18,390 --> 02:23:20,460
Have you have your zen training ahead?

2174
02:23:20,640 --> 02:23:25,640
I mean the other thing that it's great
and then that you can hear in this rather

2175
02:23:25,741 --> 02:23:30,741
than my giving you a cookie cutter answer
is that we actually have the wisdom

2176
02:23:33,150 --> 02:23:37,920
that we're seeking or that's available.
We have it in ourselves.

2177
02:23:38,190 --> 02:23:40,600
I mean you didn't have to fly to,
you know,

2178
02:23:40,770 --> 02:23:45,320
Kyoto and getting your time machine to
go back and see did you go to Ocado, um,

2179
02:23:45,630 --> 02:23:45,991
you know,

2180
02:23:45,991 --> 02:23:50,250
or whoever it happens to be the di La
or whoever happens to come to you. Um,

2181
02:23:50,280 --> 02:23:51,150
the booter or,

2182
02:23:51,270 --> 02:23:56,270
or some other great figure that actually
the goddess of compassion that we carry

2183
02:23:57,601 --> 02:23:59,460
that wisdom in our own heart.

2184
02:23:59,760 --> 02:24:04,760
And part of what these
contemplative trainings do is
they give us access just by

2185
02:24:05,671 --> 02:24:09,750
taking a little, little pause. It didn't
take you 30 seconds. Okay? He appears,

2186
02:24:10,110 --> 02:24:12,870
what do I do? Oh, here's how
my body would feel. What,

2187
02:24:12,930 --> 02:24:15,120
what perspective should I bring up?

2188
02:24:15,240 --> 02:24:19,230
Here's efficient and
benevolent use of energy. Okay?

2189
02:24:19,380 --> 02:24:22,950
Now I remember.
So these answers for the,

2190
02:24:22,980 --> 02:24:27,980
for the questions of the psyche in the
heart don't require going somewhere.

2191
02:24:31,050 --> 02:24:35,730
They ask us to quiet and begin to listen.
And as you do,

2192
02:24:35,970 --> 02:24:40,970
then you discover your own and your own
inherent wisdom and your own compassion

2193
02:24:41,161 --> 02:24:45,930
as well because the,
the benevolent use that he offers to you,

2194
02:24:46,320 --> 02:24:50,640
where does that live? It
lives in Tim. It lives in you.

2195
02:24:52,220 --> 02:24:56,590
S one of the,
one of the reasons I've,

2196
02:24:56,591 --> 02:25:01,180
I've wanted to have you on the
podcast for so long is that for me,

2197
02:25:01,181 --> 02:25:06,181
you represent a very
wide spectrum of tools.

2198
02:25:06,501 --> 02:25:11,501
So you have developed a toolkit that has
enabled you to work with everyone from

2199
02:25:12,490 --> 02:25:17,310
the, uh, the, the seekers
of say, the Buddhist, uh,

2200
02:25:17,330 --> 02:25:22,330
along the lines of the Buddhist traditions
to say adolescents who are cutters to

2201
02:25:23,020 --> 02:25:28,010
war vets with PTSD, missing limbs and
so on. You've worked with a very, uh,

2202
02:25:28,060 --> 02:25:33,060
diverse set of students
and a patients maybe even,

2203
02:25:34,300 --> 02:25:37,270
uh, in, that leads me to
my next question, which is,

2204
02:25:37,420 --> 02:25:40,300
after these experiences abroad,

2205
02:25:40,330 --> 02:25:44,680
why did you decide to pursue,
to come back?

2206
02:25:44,681 --> 02:25:46,960
Why did you decide to come
back to the U s period?

2207
02:25:46,961 --> 02:25:51,961
And then why did you decide to go back
to school and study clinical psychology?

2208
02:25:54,400 --> 02:25:59,270
So after the first five years in Asia,
um,

2209
02:25:59,650 --> 02:26:03,580
there were certain, there were a few
other westerners who would become monks.

2210
02:26:03,630 --> 02:26:07,540
It was a handful and some were going
to stay for the rest of their lives.

2211
02:26:07,750 --> 02:26:11,980
I've learned a lot. And so that was kind
of a choice. Am I just going to stay?

2212
02:26:12,670 --> 02:26:17,320
And I realized, no, I want
a family. I want a lover.

2213
02:26:17,770 --> 02:26:19,660
You know,
I was a young man after all.

2214
02:26:19,661 --> 02:26:23,650
And just the celibacy for those
years was actually pretty hard. Um,

2215
02:26:24,190 --> 02:26:25,580
I want,
um,

2216
02:26:26,350 --> 02:26:31,350
I want to see if what I have learned
really translates into the life back home.

2217
02:26:34,091 --> 02:26:37,600
I don't want to just leave it.
Um, and so I was some wrestling,

2218
02:26:37,601 --> 02:26:39,940
but it became very clear to me that,
uh,

2219
02:26:39,980 --> 02:26:44,710
that I wasn't fit for the
monastery for the rest of my life.

2220
02:26:44,711 --> 02:26:48,940
I had other, not only other
desires, but also and longings. Um,

2221
02:26:49,150 --> 02:26:53,730
but also we're real interest to say, does
this work elsewhere? Um, so I came back,

2222
02:26:53,731 --> 02:26:57,700
I thought, well, what can I do? I got
it, got a couple of jobs and right away,

2223
02:26:58,030 --> 02:27:00,550
and of course I knew how
to do is be a student,

2224
02:27:00,551 --> 02:27:04,180
but I was now a student of the mind
and the heart. And I thought, well,

2225
02:27:04,181 --> 02:27:08,410
how do I learn more about what
happened to me in the monastery? Oh,

2226
02:27:08,411 --> 02:27:10,450
I'll study western psychology.

2227
02:27:10,900 --> 02:27:15,900
And so that started me on that
particular path and I learned a lot of

2228
02:27:16,091 --> 02:27:17,350
complimentary things.

2229
02:27:17,351 --> 02:27:20,650
There are some very good trauma work in
the West that I've learned about that

2230
02:27:20,890 --> 02:27:24,310
really enhances the compassion
and loving kindness.

2231
02:27:24,311 --> 02:27:28,420
And mindfulness things that I
learned in, in the temple. Um,

2232
02:27:28,930 --> 02:27:30,790
and, uh, you know,

2233
02:27:31,210 --> 02:27:35,080
now I've done a lot of years of teaching
eastern or Western psychology together.

2234
02:27:35,560 --> 02:27:40,090
These principles that I've learned are
spreading so widely in western psychology.

2235
02:27:40,090 --> 02:27:44,890
I went to the largest therapy
conference in, in, um, the country,

2236
02:27:45,150 --> 02:27:45,520
um,

2237
02:27:45,520 --> 02:27:50,200
in December and down in Anaheim
and gave a talk and you know,

2238
02:27:50,201 --> 02:27:53,200
here's a room full of
3000 or 5,000 people.

2239
02:27:53,410 --> 02:27:55,630
And I ask how many of you have,
um,

2240
02:27:55,990 --> 02:27:58,960
some experience of meditation
or mindfulness practice?

2241
02:27:59,410 --> 02:28:04,120
And the majority of the hands went up and
that would not have happened, you know,

2242
02:28:04,270 --> 02:28:07,230
20 or 30 years ago. So, um,

2243
02:28:07,720 --> 02:28:12,640
the eastern psychology is now
becoming more invisibly woven into the

2244
02:28:12,641 --> 02:28:16,900
understandings of clinical
psychology and the West.

2245
02:28:16,901 --> 02:28:21,260
And it's beautiful. Now I want
to say something else. You know,

2246
02:28:21,261 --> 02:28:26,150
when you talk about working with
a variety of population, you know,

2247
02:28:26,420 --> 02:28:30,980
um, s yes. People in prisons. Yes,

2248
02:28:31,340 --> 02:28:36,260
that's our kids coming out
of gangs, but also, um, CEOs.

2249
02:28:36,261 --> 02:28:41,180
And there's a dialogue that
bill forward. And I did.

2250
02:28:41,181 --> 02:28:46,090
He was that that time the
chairman of Ford Motors. Um,

2251
02:28:46,190 --> 02:28:49,330
he was actually the CEO
perhaps before that, but,

2252
02:28:49,331 --> 02:28:53,840
and then it was as he's the chairman of
Ford Motors and he talks about it too.

2253
02:28:54,080 --> 02:28:57,500
It was in, um, 2008,

2254
02:28:57,501 --> 02:29:02,501
I guess when the auto industry
was just about to melt down.

2255
02:29:03,200 --> 02:29:06,230
Um, and uh, he called,

2256
02:29:06,231 --> 02:29:09,500
we'd had some contact and he's a
meditator and he said, you know,

2257
02:29:09,501 --> 02:29:10,350
I'm going to lose the,

2258
02:29:11,180 --> 02:29:14,990
my grandfather's company and maybe the
whole industry on my watch and it's hard

2259
02:29:14,991 --> 02:29:19,430
to sleep. What can I do? And we
did loving kindness practices and,

2260
02:29:19,850 --> 02:29:23,070
and, um, mindfulness practices
together and so forth.

2261
02:29:23,071 --> 02:29:26,720
Then I gave him some practices
that he could use. Um,

2262
02:29:26,810 --> 02:29:29,570
and it turns out that at
whatever level you're on,

2263
02:29:29,870 --> 02:29:34,340
whether you're incarcerated or whether
you're a CEO or whether you're a

2264
02:29:34,341 --> 02:29:35,390
returning,
that,

2265
02:29:35,780 --> 02:29:40,780
that these inner capacities that we
have to be present without getting lost,

2266
02:29:42,921 --> 02:29:44,620
to bring a, um, uh,

2267
02:29:44,780 --> 02:29:49,250
an understanding attention to these
energies just as you were doing with anger

2268
02:29:49,251 --> 02:29:53,000
in ourselves, um, are
really, really liberating.

2269
02:29:53,630 --> 02:29:56,060
And sometimes you know,
what's needed,

2270
02:29:56,061 --> 02:30:00,410
like for the vets are that the
people coming back from the war is,

2271
02:30:00,411 --> 02:30:05,000
I'm also a kind of forgiveness
practice in trauma work. Um,

2272
02:30:05,060 --> 02:30:09,230
and we'll come together and, you
know, they'll say things like,

2273
02:30:10,550 --> 02:30:14,930
um, I can't tell you what
I saw because in fact,

2274
02:30:15,110 --> 02:30:18,740
people don't want to hear the horrors
of war. They can't tell the story.

2275
02:30:18,741 --> 02:30:19,371
And if they do,

2276
02:30:19,371 --> 02:30:24,371
often they retraumatize themselves and
the people around them couldn't bear it.

2277
02:30:25,430 --> 02:30:28,400
But there's something
worse because they'll say,

2278
02:30:28,580 --> 02:30:30,530
I can't tell you what I had to do.

2279
02:30:31,640 --> 02:30:35,420
And so it's locked up in their hearts,
you know, and then what do they have?

2280
02:30:35,450 --> 02:30:39,930
They can drink or they can, you
know, um, distract themselves or, or,

2281
02:30:39,960 --> 02:30:43,130
or get in, you know,
blind rages periodically.

2282
02:30:43,520 --> 02:30:48,520
But if you get a room of returning
combat vets and hold it with,

2283
02:30:49,480 --> 02:30:53,510
um, a proper space of
understanding and compassion,

2284
02:30:53,720 --> 02:30:58,490
not only can they tell their stories,
which they've never told,

2285
02:30:58,850 --> 02:31:02,270
but they can listen to one another
and say, Oh yeah, I've been there,

2286
02:31:02,540 --> 02:31:05,450
and all of a sudden they're
not so alone anymore. And,

2287
02:31:05,510 --> 02:31:10,400
and that release of the
weight on their heart. Um,

2288
02:31:11,180 --> 02:31:15,530
so there's a social dimension to trauma
where we need to tell the story, um,

2289
02:31:15,680 --> 02:31:19,010
helps them release also what's carried
in their nervous system and in their,

2290
02:31:19,470 --> 02:31:20,303
and there's some,

2291
02:31:20,400 --> 02:31:25,400
some correlation between between those
two together that becomes very powerful

2292
02:31:27,540 --> 02:31:28,710
and we need that.
We need,

2293
02:31:28,800 --> 02:31:33,120
I do a lot of teaching of forgiveness
practice and self forgiveness and those

2294
02:31:33,121 --> 02:31:36,330
are also on those,
those guided meditations that I teach.

2295
02:31:36,870 --> 02:31:38,970
And for a lot of us self forgiveness,

2296
02:31:39,150 --> 02:31:41,880
like self compassion becomes a very,

2297
02:31:41,881 --> 02:31:46,881
very important way to liberate ourselves
from what we had to do to survive in

2298
02:31:47,161 --> 02:31:50,370
the past so that we're
actually be free in our life.

2299
02:31:51,540 --> 02:31:55,680
How do you set the stage, for
instance, with those, with those vets,

2300
02:31:56,310 --> 02:32:01,310
what do you say to them or what would
exercise might you do that opens a door

2301
02:32:01,441 --> 02:32:04,590
for them to share these stories?
So a couple of images.

2302
02:32:04,591 --> 02:32:08,160
One with gang kids and then one with that.
Um,

2303
02:32:10,270 --> 02:32:10,730
for,

2304
02:32:10,730 --> 02:32:14,910
for gang kids who come in are these kids
who are trying to get out of gangs and

2305
02:32:14,911 --> 02:32:18,300
might come with a mentor or something
like that to some events. We've had

2306
02:32:20,050 --> 02:32:23,880
any of these guys in
there, you know, ah, their,

2307
02:32:24,690 --> 02:32:26,460
their hoods are up in,

2308
02:32:26,461 --> 02:32:29,790
their hats are on backward and their
lean back and saying like, come on man,

2309
02:32:29,791 --> 02:32:32,190
you're gonna teach this meditation.
You're going to teach us,

2310
02:32:32,191 --> 02:32:36,210
give us some poem stories or bit listen,
we're out on the street.

2311
02:32:36,570 --> 02:32:38,190
People got nine millimeters,
you know,

2312
02:32:38,191 --> 02:32:43,070
you gotta give us something better
than that. So we try to make, uh,

2313
02:32:44,630 --> 02:32:49,630
a setting that honors who they
are from the very beginning.

2314
02:32:50,251 --> 02:32:50,731
We say,
well,

2315
02:32:50,731 --> 02:32:55,731
we can't talk yet about the real things
that we came here to do because there

2316
02:32:55,861 --> 02:32:59,760
are too many people in this room
who have not been acknowledged, um,

2317
02:33:00,420 --> 02:33:03,120
and not been respected.

2318
02:33:03,480 --> 02:33:08,040
So would you go out in the parking lot
and pick up a stone for every young

2319
02:33:08,041 --> 02:33:09,780
person you know who's been killed?

2320
02:33:10,530 --> 02:33:13,770
And we light one candle and put
it in the center of a table,

2321
02:33:15,150 --> 02:33:19,970
say bring it back in and say their name
and put their stone by this candle to

2322
02:33:19,971 --> 02:33:21,720
simple as possible ritual.

2323
02:33:22,200 --> 02:33:26,370
And these guys and sometimes gals will
come in and their hands are full of

2324
02:33:26,371 --> 02:33:30,900
stones. No young people should
know that many dead people. And,

2325
02:33:30,930 --> 02:33:35,580
and they'll say, this is for Tito and
this is for RJ and this is for home girl.

2326
02:33:36,540 --> 02:33:41,540
And pretty soon there's a mound of stones
and the names of people they've lost,

2327
02:33:43,860 --> 02:33:46,700
um, were, were put into the,

2328
02:33:47,070 --> 02:33:49,020
the fabric of the air of that room.

2329
02:33:49,290 --> 02:33:52,470
And their hoods are no longer over their
heads. They're sitting up like, okay,

2330
02:33:52,471 --> 02:33:55,560
this is the place where we can
talk about what's really going on.

2331
02:33:56,310 --> 02:33:59,870
So there's something about
making, whether it's through, um,

2332
02:34:00,030 --> 02:34:05,000
as the simplest ritual or making a
container in which people realize that,

2333
02:34:05,001 --> 02:34:09,120
that this is a safe place to talk about
what we've never done before with the

2334
02:34:09,121 --> 02:34:12,660
vets. One of the things that
Michael Meade, Luis Rodriguez,

2335
02:34:12,690 --> 02:34:17,070
these guys from Mosaic
Multicultural Foundation that
I've worked with for years,

2336
02:34:17,200 --> 02:34:20,990
a really wonderful, um, Michael,
who, who's in, you know,

2337
02:34:21,340 --> 02:34:25,630
a great drummer and a storyteller and
mythologist who's also been working in

2338
02:34:25,631 --> 02:34:28,810
prisons and with vets and gang
kids for years. And I'll say,

2339
02:34:28,811 --> 02:34:33,190
let me tell you an ancient
story of returning warriors.

2340
02:34:33,610 --> 02:34:38,610
And he has a handful of stories from
Africa to bat or the Mayan tradition about

2341
02:34:39,041 --> 02:34:43,900
warriors coming back, you know, with
their hands covered, with blood. Um,

2342
02:34:44,230 --> 02:34:48,250
and you know, their eyes,
uh, filled with, um,

2343
02:34:48,870 --> 02:34:53,260
the, the Mars with the Marshall
Energy that they would,

2344
02:34:53,500 --> 02:34:56,890
that they can't stop the violence
cause it's taken them over.

2345
02:34:57,250 --> 02:35:02,250
And here's a myth or a story that tells
about how ancient warriors were brought

2346
02:35:02,711 --> 02:35:05,410
back into their community.
Um,

2347
02:35:05,620 --> 02:35:08,500
I'll tell you the myth if you want
to hear one of them. Oh yes, please.

2348
02:35:09,550 --> 02:35:12,370
So here we are. You
know, and there's these,

2349
02:35:12,580 --> 02:35:17,000
there's these vets and already stories
of started to pour out about, um,

2350
02:35:17,110 --> 02:35:21,230
I can't tell you what I saw. I
can't tell you what I had to do. Um,

2351
02:35:21,310 --> 02:35:25,420
and Michael stood up and he said,
let me tell you an old Irish story of a,

2352
02:35:25,990 --> 02:35:30,730
um, an Irish warrior name, Coco Lane, or
I'm not sure how his name is pronounced,

2353
02:35:30,731 --> 02:35:32,200
something like that.
Um,

2354
02:35:32,360 --> 02:35:36,400
and he was the most fierce and
famous of all Irish warriors.

2355
02:35:36,640 --> 02:35:41,240
And the Irish warriors were, were mad
men, um, because they would go out,

2356
02:35:41,260 --> 02:35:43,270
they'd paint their bodies and
they'd go out and make it.

2357
02:35:43,271 --> 02:35:46,840
And sometimes you just see them coming
and you'd run the other way. But anyway,

2358
02:35:46,841 --> 02:35:51,640
there was some marauding king, King,

2359
02:35:51,641 --> 02:35:55,120
King and army that had come
to threaten their area.

2360
02:35:55,121 --> 02:35:59,620
And so coco lane went out and almost
single handedly chased them and defeated

2361
02:35:59,621 --> 02:36:00,454
them.

2362
02:36:00,550 --> 02:36:05,550
But then he was coming back
to his own town in a chariot,

2363
02:36:07,990 --> 02:36:12,610
covered with blood, uh,
and, um, his eyes blazing,

2364
02:36:12,820 --> 02:36:14,230
bearing down in his own town,

2365
02:36:14,231 --> 02:36:18,640
still possessed with the violence
of war with the god Mars.

2366
02:36:18,960 --> 02:36:23,590
Um, and they were all terrified he
would come and do violence there too.

2367
02:36:24,010 --> 02:36:28,840
And so they now look, can we
do, what can we do? Um, and, uh,

2368
02:36:29,530 --> 02:36:34,180
they went to ask the old wise woman in
the village and she said three things.

2369
02:36:35,060 --> 02:36:38,860
And so the first thing they lined up
all the women in the village who bared

2370
02:36:38,861 --> 02:36:42,970
their breasts and this slowed him down,
um,

2371
02:36:43,390 --> 02:36:47,890
as if it reminded him of his
mother's milk or something. Um,

2372
02:36:48,610 --> 02:36:53,080
and because he was slowed down and the
second thing they did was take a rope and

2373
02:36:53,170 --> 02:36:58,170
tie it around him and put him in
a huge cauldron of cold water,

2374
02:36:58,301 --> 02:37:00,010
which hist off his body.

2375
02:37:00,430 --> 02:37:04,790
And then they filled it three times
with cold water and find his body cooled

2376
02:37:04,791 --> 02:37:05,624
down.

2377
02:37:06,520 --> 02:37:11,520
And then the third thing they did is they
took him and still bound and they lay

2378
02:37:12,881 --> 02:37:17,070
him on a carpet in the
court of the local king. Um,

2379
02:37:17,660 --> 02:37:22,660
and they sang to him the stories and
myths and songs of warriors who had

2380
02:37:25,220 --> 02:37:30,220
protected the kingdom and then come back
and released the violence and the fears

2381
02:37:32,210 --> 02:37:37,210
that they carried and planted their
crops again and love their families.

2382
02:37:38,120 --> 02:37:38,570
Um,

2383
02:37:38,570 --> 02:37:43,400
and resumed living in harmony with
the community from which they came.

2384
02:37:43,820 --> 02:37:47,840
And they told the ancient stories and
sang the songs for three days and nights.

2385
02:37:48,170 --> 02:37:52,010
And when it was over cocoa
lane, eyes open, they let his,

2386
02:37:52,070 --> 02:37:56,060
they untied him and he was back
as a normal human being again.

2387
02:37:56,750 --> 02:38:00,150
And after Michael told
this story to that too,

2388
02:38:00,151 --> 02:38:05,151
had been telling terrible accounts
of things that happened in this room.

2389
02:38:07,220 --> 02:38:08,010
Um,

2390
02:38:08,010 --> 02:38:12,950
a hundred men stood up and we'd been
working with a simple African chant,

2391
02:38:12,951 --> 02:38:17,660
a song that was really an African
chant of a prayer, you know, um,

2392
02:38:17,840 --> 02:38:20,990
earth hold me for this.
Living is hard. Um,

2393
02:38:21,500 --> 02:38:24,390
we all sang to the vets,
um,

2394
02:38:24,530 --> 02:38:29,530
together for a long time as if we could
sing them back into their bodies from

2395
02:38:30,861 --> 02:38:35,580
this as if they were low lying there
and the, the court of the king. Um,

2396
02:38:36,050 --> 02:38:38,750
so this is, you asked
the question, how do you,

2397
02:38:38,870 --> 02:38:43,870
how do you make a setting that allows
people to truly feel that they can tell

2398
02:38:44,151 --> 02:38:47,480
their stories, um, and
be held in compassion?

2399
02:38:47,840 --> 02:38:50,360
Whether it's the grief of these gang kids,

2400
02:38:50,660 --> 02:38:54,650
that no one's really given them the
place to give voice to, you know,

2401
02:38:54,651 --> 02:38:57,650
or the vet who says,
I can't tell you what I had to do.

2402
02:39:00,680 --> 02:39:02,900
That's very powerful.

2403
02:39:03,530 --> 02:39:08,530
And it makes me also think back
to conversations I've had with uh,

2404
02:39:11,510 --> 02:39:13,580
Sebastian younger who was,
uh,

2405
02:39:14,630 --> 02:39:17,770
a wartime journalist as,
as,

2406
02:39:17,771 --> 02:39:22,771
as a co produced and shot a number
of really hiring a documentary films,

2407
02:39:24,531 --> 02:39:27,110
including Ristreppo,
uh,

2408
02:39:27,111 --> 02:39:32,111
and most recently wrote a book called
tribe that touches on some similar topic

2409
02:39:35,271 --> 02:39:38,390
area.
And leads me to ask you,

2410
02:39:39,350 --> 02:39:43,040
are there any rites of passages
or rituals that you feel

2411
02:39:44,690 --> 02:39:49,610
would be useful for every
man or woman to experience?

2412
02:39:50,990 --> 02:39:55,190
This is something that I've felt
a longing for and a lack of,

2413
02:39:55,790 --> 02:40:00,050
uh, since my teenage years
because I, I, I'm not Jewish,

2414
02:40:00,051 --> 02:40:01,680
did not have a bat mitzvah,
Bar Mitzvah.

2415
02:40:01,880 --> 02:40:04,790
I don't know if that
serves that purpose in the,

2416
02:40:04,880 --> 02:40:08,630
in the Jewish tradition necessarily.
But are there any,

2417
02:40:09,260 --> 02:40:14,010
any rituals or rites of passage that
you think we could use in, let's

2418
02:40:14,010 --> 02:40:16,590
just say the United States?
Uh,

2419
02:40:16,830 --> 02:40:20,040
that would be helpful too.

2420
02:40:20,940 --> 02:40:25,770
Whether it's a specific population,
specific group or uh,

2421
02:40:26,190 --> 02:40:27,023
anyone.

2422
02:40:27,510 --> 02:40:31,740
So while you're talking about is a
really big subject that's a subject of

2423
02:40:31,741 --> 02:40:35,400
initiation and unfortunately bar Mitzvahs,
at least when I was in there,

2424
02:40:35,810 --> 02:40:39,180
whereas it was a relatively
lightweight and meaningless thing.

2425
02:40:39,181 --> 02:40:42,270
You get up there and you recite your,
you know,

2426
02:40:42,300 --> 02:40:46,350
Hebrew portion of the Bible and now
you're a man and they give you a bunch of

2427
02:40:46,351 --> 02:40:49,160
presence and there wasn't a
lot of meaning in it. But the,

2428
02:40:49,410 --> 02:40:54,410
the problem that you raise is that of
the lack of initiation and what's true is

2429
02:40:54,451 --> 02:40:57,270
that it's been forgotten in our culture.
Um,

2430
02:40:57,420 --> 02:41:01,650
one of the few places you get
initiation is going into the military.

2431
02:41:01,651 --> 02:41:06,600
That's an initiation. Um, but a lot
of these gang kids, for example,

2432
02:41:06,810 --> 02:41:10,050
they're trying to initiate themselves,
which can't really happen.

2433
02:41:10,050 --> 02:41:14,190
You need elders and you needed in a
ritualized way, but they'll go on that,

2434
02:41:14,210 --> 02:41:17,340
you know, if you're in the Mussai, uh,

2435
02:41:17,580 --> 02:41:21,800
tradition in east Africa
and the Messiah people, um,

2436
02:41:22,800 --> 02:41:27,540
as everybody's heard, you know, a young
man at a certain age of 14 or something,

2437
02:41:27,780 --> 02:41:30,290
we'll go out and kill a lion,
um,

2438
02:41:30,450 --> 02:41:35,010
to prove that they're now an adult member
of the society and that they're brave.

2439
02:41:35,011 --> 02:41:37,320
And that's part of their initiation.

2440
02:41:37,670 --> 02:41:41,910
There were initiations for young women
as well. Um, and it's not just an Africa.

2441
02:41:41,911 --> 02:41:44,730
The Mayans had initiations.
And in Thailand,

2442
02:41:44,731 --> 02:41:49,560
when I lived there back starting
in the 1960s, at that point,

2443
02:41:49,800 --> 02:41:52,830
almost every young man
and many young women,

2444
02:41:53,280 --> 02:41:56,820
when they reached the age of 1920,

2445
02:41:57,300 --> 02:42:02,300
they became a monk for three months or
for a year and lived in an austere way.

2446
02:42:02,371 --> 02:42:07,260
And it was part of their initiation to
learn both the inner life of themselves

2447
02:42:07,500 --> 02:42:11,970
and also a kind of discipline. We
don't have it. And because of it,

2448
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:15,690
you know, kids who are trying to initiate
themselves on the streets by, you know,

2449
02:42:15,840 --> 02:42:19,550
shooting somebody or doing something,
you know, that shows that they're brave,

2450
02:42:19,551 --> 02:42:23,220
but it's not a lion, it's
another person or it's, you know,

2451
02:42:23,640 --> 02:42:27,510
I'm trying to get the attention
of the others and say, prove how,

2452
02:42:27,720 --> 02:42:30,150
how powerful or strong they are.

2453
02:42:30,540 --> 02:42:35,490
So we desperately need these and we need
them built into our education and to

2454
02:42:35,491 --> 02:42:38,580
our psychology. Um, and I
can't give you a simple answer,

2455
02:42:38,760 --> 02:42:43,560
but one of the people who's has the
most intelligence about this is a man of

2456
02:42:43,561 --> 02:42:48,360
colleague of mine named Michael
Meade. Um, and if you look on mosaic,

2457
02:42:48,361 --> 02:42:53,361
multicultural foundation is the writings
on initiation and what's possible here

2458
02:42:53,731 --> 02:42:58,170
and the things he's led our very,
very inspiring.

2459
02:42:58,640 --> 02:43:02,790
Um, so that's a place that I would look,
that's a good starting point. Wonderful.

2460
02:43:02,940 --> 02:43:05,400
I will certainly find that. Well, Jack,

2461
02:43:05,401 --> 02:43:09,540
I think we could go for hours and hours
and hours and I always love chatting

2462
02:43:09,541 --> 02:43:12,070
with you and I'd love to
perhaps even consider doing

2463
02:43:12,070 --> 02:43:16,480
a part two sometime. But given that
we've already gone for two plus hours,

2464
02:43:16,540 --> 02:43:21,340
I want to ask just a few
more questions and uh,

2465
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:24,700
I'll actually start with just
reading something very short,

2466
02:43:24,760 --> 02:43:28,690
which is from your 2017 year end message.

2467
02:43:29,470 --> 02:43:33,700
And uh, this is, I think this
is just to inject some more,

2468
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:40,930
uh, optimism into our conversation,
which we've already had plenty of.

2469
02:43:40,931 --> 02:43:45,400
But, uh, this is, this is just a small
portion of your year end message.

2470
02:43:46,210 --> 02:43:49,270
A Martin Luther King Jr describes
our collective journey with hope.

2471
02:43:50,050 --> 02:43:51,850
The arc of the moral universe is long,

2472
02:43:51,851 --> 02:43:56,020
but it bends towards justice and quote
and Pablo Neruda Explains Further,

2473
02:43:56,440 --> 02:43:59,410
you can cut all the flowers,
but you cannot keep spring from coming.

2474
02:44:00,400 --> 02:44:02,620
Renewal is happening.
This is back to your voice.

2475
02:44:03,070 --> 02:44:04,780
Take quiet time to listen to your heart,

2476
02:44:04,781 --> 02:44:07,270
to meditate and to rest of
midst the great turnings.

2477
02:44:07,300 --> 02:44:11,710
Feel the renewal of spring that can be
born in you. Align yourself with goodness.

2478
02:44:12,070 --> 02:44:15,820
Let yourself blossom like a Lotus or
whatever unique flower you are shining in

2479
02:44:15,821 --> 02:44:20,290
the world, offering tiny seeds of love
amidst it all. Blessings to you in 2018,

2480
02:44:20,890 --> 02:44:25,030
Jack.
And I want this,

2481
02:44:25,600 --> 02:44:29,990
this note to then lead into,
uh,

2482
02:44:30,070 --> 02:44:31,840
in certainly you're
welcome to comment on that,

2483
02:44:31,841 --> 02:44:36,610
but which book you would recommend of
yours people start with or where they

2484
02:44:36,611 --> 02:44:39,760
start with all of the many materials,
recordings,

2485
02:44:39,761 --> 02:44:42,340
readings that you
produced because you're a,

2486
02:44:43,080 --> 02:44:45,540
a fantastic writer and a prolific writer.
Uh,

2487
02:44:45,550 --> 02:44:48,430
you have some of my favorite book
titles I've ever heard by the way,

2488
02:44:48,460 --> 02:44:52,210
including after the ecstasy, the
laundry, which maybe we could touch on,

2489
02:44:52,211 --> 02:44:55,960
but where would you suggest people start,
uh,

2490
02:44:55,961 --> 02:45:00,100
of the many things that
you've, that you've written
and shared with the world. Uh,

2491
02:45:00,300 --> 02:45:03,760
and, and if you have any comments
on that year end message,

2492
02:45:03,790 --> 02:45:04,990
you're welcome to share that as well.
Cool.

2493
02:45:05,590 --> 02:45:10,300
So from books, if you want
something simple, I have books like,

2494
02:45:10,330 --> 02:45:14,200
um, you know, an introduction
to meditation that sounds true.

2495
02:45:14,201 --> 02:45:17,800
Publishes or I have, um, um,

2496
02:45:17,801 --> 02:45:20,890
a little book called the art of
forgiveness, loving kindness and peace,

2497
02:45:20,891 --> 02:45:25,040
which is very simple
stories and practices. Um,

2498
02:45:25,210 --> 02:45:28,150
if you want something
that's richer and fuller,

2499
02:45:28,151 --> 02:45:30,040
then you could look at
one of my bigger books,

2500
02:45:30,041 --> 02:45:32,680
like a path with heart or the wise heart,

2501
02:45:32,681 --> 02:45:37,320
the guide to the two principals
of Buddhist psychology. Um,

2502
02:45:37,450 --> 02:45:37,871
and again,

2503
02:45:37,871 --> 02:45:42,070
I think lots of stuff
online and SoundsTrue's
particularly a good place to go

2504
02:45:42,071 --> 02:45:45,940
along with my website. Um, then,

2505
02:45:46,090 --> 02:45:48,580
and that 40 day mindfulness
mindfulness daily,

2506
02:45:48,581 --> 02:45:52,140
which is think it's like 30 bucks
or something. And you, you know, um,

2507
02:45:52,270 --> 02:45:55,070
is a really wonderful way to start.
Um,

2508
02:45:55,450 --> 02:45:59,830
in terms of what I had written,
uh, about the trusting heart,

2509
02:45:59,831 --> 02:46:04,831
one of the greatest zen techs from
thousand years ago says to be awakened or

2510
02:46:05,351 --> 02:46:09,290
enlightened is one with
trusting heart and mind.

2511
02:46:09,830 --> 02:46:12,830
And it doesn't mean that,
that we won't go through hard times.

2512
02:46:12,831 --> 02:46:16,520
We always have and we will again,
and we are now in many ways,

2513
02:46:17,120 --> 02:46:22,120
but that we also have born within us
the capacity to meet these difficulties

2514
02:46:23,601 --> 02:46:28,460
with, uh, understanding, um, and
with courage, with compassion,

2515
02:46:28,790 --> 02:46:31,880
and to transform them.
And in that way,

2516
02:46:31,910 --> 02:46:34,780
one of my favorite recent books is,
um,

2517
02:46:35,120 --> 02:46:39,350
called the better angels of our
nature by Steven pinker. Um,

2518
02:46:39,380 --> 02:46:42,830
and he's a remarkable professor
at Harvard anthropologist,

2519
02:46:42,831 --> 02:46:45,020
historian talking about,
um,

2520
02:46:45,260 --> 02:46:50,260
the growing consciousness of humanity in
spite of the kind of wars and conflict

2521
02:46:50,301 --> 02:46:51,320
and environmental things.

2522
02:46:51,490 --> 02:46:56,480
There are so many good things that have
happened that he charts over the last

2523
02:46:56,480 --> 02:47:00,260
few centuries of the development
of, um, you know, uh,

2524
02:47:00,290 --> 02:47:03,010
certain certain abilities for peacemaking.

2525
02:47:03,020 --> 02:47:07,970
There's actually less for than there
had been. Um, you know, respect for,

2526
02:47:08,120 --> 02:47:12,890
for women. Um, the reduction
in, uh, you know, child labor,

2527
02:47:12,891 --> 02:47:16,380
all kinds of things. And,
and in that same regard, um,

2528
02:47:16,430 --> 02:47:19,160
there's a wonderful book
called very the chains,

2529
02:47:19,430 --> 02:47:22,670
which is about the ending of
slavery in the British Empire,

2530
02:47:22,880 --> 02:47:26,220
starting with this handful of men,
um,

2531
02:47:26,240 --> 02:47:31,240
who met in a British tea shop or printing
shop and spent 30 years riding around

2532
02:47:33,591 --> 02:47:37,100
the country bringing ex
slaves who are well spoken to,

2533
02:47:37,101 --> 02:47:39,770
talk about the middle passage and the,
you know,

2534
02:47:39,771 --> 02:47:42,020
the horrors of slavery and so forth.

2535
02:47:42,110 --> 02:47:46,850
And even though the British Empire's
economic engine was built around slavery

2536
02:47:46,851 --> 02:47:51,320
and sugar by the end of their work,
um,

2537
02:47:51,680 --> 02:47:55,910
of 30 years, uh, the
British parliament, um,

2538
02:47:56,260 --> 02:47:59,440
outlawed slavery and the British Empire,
you know,

2539
02:47:59,480 --> 02:48:04,480
decades before it happened in the u s
and the Quakers were a big part of this.

2540
02:48:04,641 --> 02:48:07,880
And the Quakers famously wouldn't
take their hats off for the king.

2541
02:48:09,710 --> 02:48:13,070
But when, um, what is his name?

2542
02:48:13,071 --> 02:48:15,380
Thomas Clarkson,

2543
02:48:15,740 --> 02:48:20,360
who was the center of this group trying
to end slavery and going everywhere to

2544
02:48:20,361 --> 02:48:24,770
do it. When Thomas Clarkson died,
the goal, the Quakers of the England,

2545
02:48:24,950 --> 02:48:27,560
England took their hats off because he'd,

2546
02:48:27,840 --> 02:48:31,370
he's freed so many
spirits and so many lives.

2547
02:48:31,640 --> 02:48:35,600
So the possible we have these amazing
possibilities that human beings,

2548
02:48:35,780 --> 02:48:40,430
and we're just growing into them now
culturally. Um, and it's about time.

2549
02:48:40,780 --> 02:48:42,400
Um, but it's, it, they're the,

2550
02:48:42,401 --> 02:48:45,920
they are possible and we each have a,

2551
02:48:46,230 --> 02:48:47,960
have a contribution to make in it.

2552
02:48:50,050 --> 02:48:54,970
Jack, I'm going to ask you one more
question before we wrap up with, uh,

2553
02:48:55,100 --> 02:48:55,790
just,
uh,

2554
02:48:55,790 --> 02:48:58,690
letting people know where they can
find you on social media and elsewhere,

2555
02:48:58,730 --> 02:49:02,760
the website and so on. But last question
is, one I like to ask, and this is,

2556
02:49:02,761 --> 02:49:04,730
this is a metaphor,

2557
02:49:05,090 --> 02:49:09,390
but if you could a short
message on a billboard,

2558
02:49:10,410 --> 02:49:14,160
in other words, get them. I get a message
out to millions or billions of people.

2559
02:49:14,400 --> 02:49:17,940
It could be a few words, one
word, a phrase, a quote of yours,

2560
02:49:17,941 --> 02:49:21,270
a quote of someone else's. Uh, what
might you put on that billboard?

2561
02:49:22,420 --> 02:49:23,253
Yeah.

2562
02:49:23,450 --> 02:49:26,930
Um, well, two things come to mind.

2563
02:49:28,910 --> 02:49:33,910
One is a question that when I sit with
sat with people many times at the end of

2564
02:49:34,160 --> 02:49:36,100
their life that they,

2565
02:49:36,120 --> 02:49:39,650
that they then ask of themselves
silently or out loud is,

2566
02:49:40,040 --> 02:49:44,820
did I love well, because in the
end what matters is really, um,

2567
02:49:45,650 --> 02:49:49,790
the billboard would have a question
rather than a statement. Um,

2568
02:49:50,150 --> 02:49:53,060
and it would have a
question. Something like, um,

2569
02:49:55,550 --> 02:50:00,300
I don't know, how could I love myself
better or what, what, you know,

2570
02:50:00,360 --> 02:50:05,280
so that it actually, it's not that
I'm going to tell them something,

2571
02:50:05,520 --> 02:50:07,290
they already know this,

2572
02:50:07,500 --> 02:50:12,500
but I'm going to remind those who read
that there is something that's asking to

2573
02:50:12,901 --> 02:50:17,220
be awakened in them. How could I
love myself? And this world better.

2574
02:50:17,790 --> 02:50:21,290
And then you know, or what gets
and you know, then you'd go, well,

2575
02:50:21,291 --> 02:50:23,190
it gets in the way of that.
And how can I love that too?

2576
02:50:23,430 --> 02:50:26,240
How can I love myself in
this world better? Hmm.

2577
02:50:28,010 --> 02:50:32,660
Well, Jack, I want to of course,
thank you for your time today,

2578
02:50:32,661 --> 02:50:36,860
but, uh, beyond that, I want to
thank you and this is, this is very,

2579
02:50:37,500 --> 02:50:41,240
um,
very much from deep in my heart.

2580
02:50:41,750 --> 02:50:46,750
Thank you for helping me to learn to
love myself better and quite frankly,

2581
02:50:47,120 --> 02:50:51,650
to see something in the first
place that is worth loving.

2582
02:50:51,651 --> 02:50:55,860
That's not a where I've spent
most of my life. So it's,

2583
02:50:55,861 --> 02:50:59,090
it's turned into, uh, if not my,

2584
02:50:59,091 --> 02:51:00,950
I hesitate to say my top
priority because I'm,

2585
02:51:01,570 --> 02:51:04,250
I worry about sounding
it's self indulgent,

2586
02:51:04,251 --> 02:51:09,251
but it's become one of the most important
and fruitful tasks in my life is

2587
02:51:11,660 --> 02:51:14,990
asking that question,
how could I love myself better?

2588
02:51:15,020 --> 02:51:19,900
Or how could I learn to love
myself better? So thank you
very, very sincerely, uh,

2589
02:51:20,180 --> 02:51:24,950
for that. And that the words don't do
it justice, but, uh, uh, I'll, I'll,

2590
02:51:25,130 --> 02:51:27,470
that's all. That's the best I
can do right now, remotely is to,

2591
02:51:27,471 --> 02:51:30,170
is to put it into words.
So thank you for that.

2592
02:51:30,710 --> 02:51:32,450
Thank you Tim.
This was,

2593
02:51:32,510 --> 02:51:37,510
this was a pleasure to do and what I feel
and I know is it as you tend your own

2594
02:51:38,571 --> 02:51:40,730
heart,
I'm in a wise way,

2595
02:51:40,880 --> 02:51:44,090
then it makes you available
to bring the gifts,

2596
02:51:44,150 --> 02:51:48,180
the many gifts you have to the
world, you personally and others. Um,

2597
02:51:48,500 --> 02:51:51,980
but to do it in a way that's on the
carrier wave of connection and love and it

2598
02:51:51,981 --> 02:51:56,210
transforms everything. So
thank you to, Well Jack, I uh,
you know, I'm looking at it

2599
02:51:56,230 --> 02:51:59,680
texts one of ours and I'm feeling
the necklace around my neck,

2600
02:51:59,681 --> 02:52:00,850
which is really a thread,

2601
02:52:00,930 --> 02:52:05,170
a red thread that was used to
close the one of the elements,

2602
02:52:05,320 --> 02:52:07,840
the closing of the 10 day silent retreat.

2603
02:52:08,470 --> 02:52:13,470
And I shot you a text not too long ago
asking what the three nots meant because

2604
02:52:14,291 --> 02:52:17,920
I'd forgotten.
And this is what you wrote back first,

2605
02:52:17,921 --> 02:52:22,420
not equals refuge in whatever you hold
is most inspiring and sacred. Second,

2606
02:52:22,870 --> 02:52:25,630
commitment to compassion
for self and others. Third,

2607
02:52:25,870 --> 02:52:27,850
following your highest intention.

2608
02:52:28,420 --> 02:52:33,420
And the intention that I've said at the
end of that 10 day retreat was to learn

2609
02:52:33,971 --> 02:52:38,890
to love myself so I could
love others more fully. Uh,

2610
02:52:38,920 --> 02:52:43,920
but I've realized that maybe what it is
is learning to love myself so I can help

2611
02:52:44,111 --> 02:52:48,610
others learn to do the same.
And you've been an integral piece of that.

2612
02:52:48,970 --> 02:52:50,230
And uh,

2613
02:52:50,350 --> 02:52:55,350
I just love that I have the opportunity
to introduce you and your work and these

2614
02:52:56,141 --> 02:53:00,910
traditions to more people. And uh,
I will certainly be linking to,

2615
02:53:01,380 --> 02:53:03,850
uh,
where everyone can find you online,

2616
02:53:03,851 --> 02:53:06,470
but are there any particular
best places just to,

2617
02:53:06,550 --> 02:53:10,120
to reiterate where people can find you
and I'll link to these in the show notes.

2618
02:53:10,290 --> 02:53:11,123
Uh,

2619
02:53:11,230 --> 02:53:16,230
Jack kornfield.com and also look up Jack
Cornfield on soundstrue.com for those

2620
02:53:16,571 --> 02:53:19,720
programs that I talked about.
And then spirit rock.org,

2621
02:53:19,721 --> 02:53:24,220
which is our great
meditation center in the Bay,

2622
02:53:24,221 --> 02:53:25,450
San Francisco Bay area.

2623
02:53:26,080 --> 02:53:27,730
Absolutely stunning,
stunning,

2624
02:53:27,731 --> 02:53:32,731
beautiful location worth visiting
just to bathe in the scenery,

2625
02:53:33,070 --> 02:53:37,030
but many more reasons to visit as well.
Uh,

2626
02:53:37,780 --> 02:53:42,280
well Jack, thank you again and thank
you. Thank you Tim. It's a pleasure.

2627
02:53:42,430 --> 02:53:46,450
And to everybody listening,
you can find show notes,

2628
02:53:46,451 --> 02:53:50,380
links to all the resources, books, and
everything that we discussed at Tim. Dot.

2629
02:53:50,381 --> 02:53:55,270
Blog slash podcast. And until next
time, thank you so much for listening.

2630
02:53:58,580 --> 02:54:02,000
Hey guys, this is Tim again. Just a
few more things before you take off.

2631
02:54:02,330 --> 02:54:04,970
Number one,
this is five bullet Friday.

2632
02:54:05,300 --> 02:54:08,240
Do you want to get a short email from me?

2633
02:54:08,270 --> 02:54:12,410
Would you enjoy getting a short email
from me every Friday that provides a

2634
02:54:12,411 --> 02:54:15,720
little more soul of fun before the
weekend and five bullet Fridays,

2635
02:54:15,740 --> 02:54:20,300
a very short email where
I share the coolest things
I've found or that I've been

2636
02:54:20,301 --> 02:54:21,590
pondering over the week.

2637
02:54:21,830 --> 02:54:24,590
That could include favorite new
albums that I've discovered.

2638
02:54:24,591 --> 02:54:28,070
It could include Gizmos and gadgets
and all sorts of weird shit that I've

2639
02:54:28,071 --> 02:54:32,360
somehow dug up in the, uh, the
world of the esoteric as I do.

2640
02:54:32,630 --> 02:54:37,630
It could include favorite articles that
I've read and that I've shared with my

2641
02:54:38,331 --> 02:54:41,030
close friends, for instance.
And it's very short.

2642
02:54:41,120 --> 02:54:46,100
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness
before you head off for the weekend.

2643
02:54:46,160 --> 02:54:48,320
So if you want to receive that,
check it out.

2644

2646
02:54:55,971 --> 02:54:58,520
next one. And if you sign

2647
02:54:59,750 --> 02:55:02,690
This episode is brought to you
by fresh books, man. Oh Man.

2648
02:55:02,691 --> 02:55:07,280
Do a of listeners to this podcast and
readers in mind love fresh books to the

2649
02:55:07,281 --> 02:55:10,850
extent that I ended up meeting
with the CEO not very long ago.

2650
02:55:11,360 --> 02:55:12,980
Why are they so popular?
Well,

2651
02:55:13,130 --> 02:55:17,150
they are the number one cloud accounting
software designed exclusively for self

2652
02:55:17,210 --> 02:55:18,560
employed professionals.

2653
02:55:18,590 --> 02:55:21,770
That's many of you and use by more
than 10 million people and you can send

2654
02:55:21,771 --> 02:55:25,310
invoices, track your time and
get paid very, very quickly,

2655
02:55:25,520 --> 02:55:27,230
which suits the needs
of a lot of freelancers.

2656
02:55:27,231 --> 02:55:29,900
I'll have to onto my
friend Louis and beyond.

2657
02:55:30,470 --> 02:55:32,180
You can't take pictures of receipts.

2658
02:55:32,181 --> 02:55:33,650
You can link your credit
card and debit card,

2659
02:55:33,651 --> 02:55:38,630
so all the things you buy automatically
appear in your fresh books in the right

2660
02:55:38,631 --> 02:55:42,230
category, so on and so forth. Makes
taxes easy, makes invoices easy,

2661
02:55:42,231 --> 02:55:46,970
it makes your life easier.
And also in fact I recommend a pdf.

2662
02:55:47,050 --> 02:55:48,860
Uh, they didn't ask me to
read this part by the way.

2663
02:55:49,100 --> 02:55:53,690
They'd put the other pdf awhile back
called breaking the time barrier subtitle,

2664
02:55:53,691 --> 02:55:56,720
how to unlock your true earning potential
so you can search for breaking the

2665
02:55:56,721 --> 02:55:58,940
time barrier.
A lot of people ask me,

2666
02:55:59,660 --> 02:56:02,480
how can I get a four hour work
week with a service business?

2667
02:56:02,690 --> 02:56:07,160
And the story in that Ebook, it's pdf is
the short answer is really, really good.

2668
02:56:07,220 --> 02:56:10,550
So I think should also check that out.
So breaking the time error, check it out,

2669
02:56:10,790 --> 02:56:13,580

2676
02:56:40,580 --> 02:56:43,310
This episode is brought
to you by four sigmatic.

2677
02:56:43,340 --> 02:56:46,130
You might remember four sigmatic
for their mushroom coffee,

2678
02:56:46,190 --> 02:56:50,300
which was created by those clever finished
founders and when I first mentioned

2679
02:56:50,390 --> 02:56:53,720
that coffee on this podcast,
the product sold out in less than a week.

2680
02:56:53,721 --> 02:56:57,800
It lights you up like a Christmas tree,
which can be really useful. However,

2681
02:56:58,070 --> 02:57:02,180
recently I've been testing the opposite
side of the spectrum of new product and

2682
02:57:02,181 --> 02:57:07,010
that is their Reishi mushroom elixir
to help me end my day to get to sleep.

2683
02:57:07,790 --> 02:57:09,950
As you guys may know,
longtime listeners,

2684
02:57:09,951 --> 02:57:13,610
at least I struggled with insomnia for
decades. I have a largely fixed that,

2685
02:57:13,640 --> 02:57:16,730
but still shutting off my monkey
brain has never been easy.

2686
02:57:16,731 --> 02:57:19,460
It still isn't easy very
often and I found Reishi,

2687
02:57:19,461 --> 02:57:22,850
which had been fascinated by for
a few years now has been very,

2688
02:57:22,851 --> 02:57:26,750
very effective and calming
their old formula. However,

2689
02:57:26,770 --> 02:57:31,670
four sigmatic old formula included
Stevia and I like to avoid sweeteners,

2690
02:57:31,730 --> 02:57:36,730
all sweeteners for a host of reasons
and I then just ping them and asked,

2691
02:57:37,940 --> 02:57:42,230
hey guys, I would love to experiment
with this and maybe actually suggested,

2692
02:57:42,290 --> 02:57:45,650
but I'd like a version without
sweeteners if you'd be open to it.

2693
02:57:45,840 --> 02:57:46,940
Too much of a headache,
don't worry.

2694
02:57:47,360 --> 02:57:51,080
And they are always game
for experimentation.

2695
02:57:51,110 --> 02:57:54,020
And so they created a special
custom version without the Stevia,

2696
02:57:54,021 --> 02:57:57,350
without sweeteners.
Now it is part of my nightly routine.

2697
02:57:57,920 --> 02:58:00,500
Their ratio looks or comes
in single serving packets,

2698
02:58:00,501 --> 02:58:02,130
which are perfect for travel.
And in fact,

2699
02:58:02,131 --> 02:58:04,980
I'm about to leave the country right
now and I have a packet in front of me

2700
02:58:04,981 --> 02:58:08,460
that's just going to sit in
the end of my carry on bag.

2701
02:58:08,730 --> 02:58:12,420
You only need hot water and it mixes very,
very easily.

2702
02:58:13,110 --> 02:58:17,220
Here's some recommended copies
that they put in the read,

2703
02:58:17,430 --> 02:58:20,250
so I'm going to read it and
I'll give you my take quote,

2704
02:58:20,580 --> 02:58:22,560
a warning for those in
the experimental mindset,

2705
02:58:22,650 --> 02:58:26,100
Reishi is strong and bitter in
parentheses, like any great medicine.

2706
02:58:26,310 --> 02:58:27,660
So if the bitterness is too much,

2707
02:58:27,661 --> 02:58:30,750
I recommend trying it with honey
end or nut milk such as almond milk.

2708
02:58:31,230 --> 02:58:34,140
And so I'm going to say,
no,

2709
02:58:34,200 --> 02:58:38,640
you should suck it up and you should drink
the tea because it's not that bitter.

2710
02:58:39,090 --> 02:58:42,900
And maybe should take the advice of all
Chinese people when they're criticizing

2711
02:58:42,901 --> 02:58:45,390
younguns when they say who and sure.
Cool,

2712
02:58:45,450 --> 02:58:47,820
which means you're not
able to eat bitterness.

2713
02:58:47,821 --> 02:58:52,821
Bitter is in many cases and indication
of things that help liver detoxification.

2714
02:58:53,581 --> 02:58:55,740
It's on,
not saying that's the case here,

2715
02:58:55,741 --> 02:59:00,540
but I've tested this ratio
lecture on family members,

2716
02:59:00,541 --> 02:59:03,000
on friends. Everybody has liked
it. It's a little bit, or if the,

2717
02:59:03,001 --> 02:59:06,810
it's not that hard,
so I would just say suck it up and no,

2718
02:59:06,900 --> 02:59:11,010
don't put in honey or milk or any of
that shit. Just drink the goddamn tea.

2719
02:59:11,011 --> 02:59:14,820
It's delicious. I think if you like to
air that kind of stuff, that type of tea,

2720
02:59:15,300 --> 02:59:19,490
you're going to dig it. So just
try it. Okay. Back to them by read.

2721
02:59:19,770 --> 02:59:23,670
If you'd like to naturally improve
your sleep, both onset and quality,

2722
02:59:23,700 --> 02:59:28,700
I think naturally you might just enjoy
this ratio lecture without any sweet

2723
02:59:29,210 --> 02:59:33,420
nurse. It has organic, Reishi
extract, organic fueled, mint extract,

2724
02:59:33,421 --> 02:59:37,890
organic rose hips extract, organic
Tulsi extract, and that's it.

2725
02:59:38,460 --> 02:59:43,080
No fancy stuff, no artificial watching
McCall at anything. So check it out.
