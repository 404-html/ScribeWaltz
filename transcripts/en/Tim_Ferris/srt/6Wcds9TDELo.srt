1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,880
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02,881 --> 00:00:06,970
I can run flat out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking. No else,

3
00:00:06,971 --> 00:00:07,804
you posting a question?

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,460
I'm a cybernetic organism living tissue.

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,100
This episode is brought
to you by four sigmatic.

6
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:29,950
You might remember four sigmatic
for their mushroom coffee,

7
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,740
which was created by those
clever finished founders,

8
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,560
and when I first mentioned
that coffee on this podcast,

9
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:39,040
the product sold out in less than a week
at lights you up like a Christmas tree,

10
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:41,590
which can be really useful.
However,

11
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:46,000
recently I've been testing the opposite
side of the spectrum and new product and

12
00:00:46,001 --> 00:00:50,830
that is their Reishi mushroom elixir
to help me end my day to get to sleep.

13
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,740
As you guys may know,
longtime listeners,

14
00:00:53,741 --> 00:00:57,460
at least I struggled with insomnia for
decades. I have a largely fixed that,

15
00:00:57,461 --> 00:01:00,550
but still shutting off my monkey
brain has never been easy,

16
00:01:00,551 --> 00:01:03,280
still isn't easy very often,
and I found Reishi,

17
00:01:03,281 --> 00:01:06,670
which I've been fascinated by for
a few years now, has been very,

18
00:01:06,671 --> 00:01:10,600
very effective and calming
their old formula. However,

19
00:01:10,601 --> 00:01:15,490
four sigmatic old formula included
Stevia and I like to avoid sweeteners,

20
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,310
all sweeteners for a host of reasons,

21
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:22,300
and I then just ping them and asked,
hey guys,

22
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:26,050
I would love to experiment with
this and maybe actually suggested,

23
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,470
but I'd like a version without
sweeteners if you'd be open to it,

24
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:30,760
if too much of a headache,
don't worry.

25
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:34,900
And they are always game
for experimentation.

26
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,840
And so they created a special
custom version without the Stevia,

27
00:01:37,841 --> 00:01:41,200
without sweeteners.
Now it is part of my nightly routine.

28
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,320
Their ratio elixir comes
in single serving packets,

29
00:01:44,321 --> 00:01:47,260
which are perfect for travel and in fact
I'm about to leave the country right

30
00:01:47,261 --> 00:01:51,100
now and I have a packet in front of me
that's just going to sit in the end of my

31
00:01:51,101 --> 00:01:55,630
carry on bag.
You only need hot water and it mixes very,

32
00:01:55,631 --> 00:01:56,464
very easily.

33
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:01,060
Here's some recommended copy
that they put in the read,

34
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,120
so I'm going to read it and then
I'll give you my take quote.

35
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:08,380
A warning for those in the experimental
mindset ratio is strong and bitter in

36
00:02:08,381 --> 00:02:11,470
parentheses, like any great medicine.
So if the bitterness is too much,

37
00:02:11,471 --> 00:02:15,760
I recommend trying it with honey end or
nut milk such as almond milk and quote.

38
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,980
So I'm going to say no,

39
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:22,480
you should suck it up and you should drink
the tea because it's not that bitter.

40
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:26,050
And maybe you should take the advice
of all Chinese people when they're

41
00:02:26,051 --> 00:02:29,230
criticizing ins. When they
say Boone, I'm sure cool.

42
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,630
Which means you're not
able to eat bitterness.

43
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:36,660
Bitter is in many cases and indication
of things that help liver detoxification

44
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:39,550
and so on.
Not saying that's the case here,

45
00:02:39,551 --> 00:02:44,350
but I've tested this ratio
lecture on family members,

46
00:02:44,351 --> 00:02:48,160
on friends. Everybody has liked it. It's
a little bit earthy. It's not that hard.

47
00:02:48,161 --> 00:02:50,650
So I would just say suck it up and no,

48
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,820
don't put in honey or milk or any of
that shit. Just drink the goddamn tea.

49
00:02:54,821 --> 00:02:57,910
It's delicious I think. Right? If you
like [inaudible], that kind of stuff,

50
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:01,480
that type of tea, you're going
to dig it. So just try it. Okay.

51
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,590
Back to then my read. If you'd like
to naturally improve your sleep,

52
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:10,660
both onset end quality, I think
naturally you might just enjoy this.

53
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:15,580
Reishi Elixir without any sweeteners.
It has organic, Reishi extract,

54
00:03:15,581 --> 00:03:20,230
organic fueled, mint extract, organic
rose hips extract, organic Tulsi extract.

55
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,380
And that's it.
No fancy stuff,

56
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:26,890
no artificial watching McCall at anything.

69
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:23,900
This episode is brought to
you by helix sleep. Last year,

70
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:27,680
I committed to making
sleep a top priority,

71
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:32,840
trying to fix onset insomnia or
continuing to fix that depth of sleep,

72
00:04:32,841 --> 00:04:34,850
quality of sleep.
I tracked a lot.

73
00:04:34,851 --> 00:04:39,851
I tested a lot and I revisited really
everything from the daily routine to the

74
00:04:40,521 --> 00:04:43,370
surfaces. I slept on playing
with the chilly pad, whatever,

75
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,890
and when I moved to
Austin I got all new beds,

76
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,530
including mattresses from Helix,

77
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:52,250
working with the world's leading
sleep experts. Certainly some of them.

78
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:56,150
He looks sleep developed mattresses
personalized to your preferences and sleep

79
00:04:56,151 --> 00:05:00,500
style to make sure that you can have
the best sleep possible without costing

80
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:02,210
thousands upon thousands of dollars.

81
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,470
He looks sleep has recently added a new
layer to customize sleep with the helix

82
00:05:06,471 --> 00:05:07,250
pillow.

83
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:10,730
The all new pillows are fully adjustable
so you can achieve perfect comfort

84
00:05:10,731 --> 00:05:14,660
regardless of sleep position or body type,
or if you're a shifty type like me,

85
00:05:14,661 --> 00:05:16,190
I move around quite a bit when I sleep.

86
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:20,600
Just take their simple two to three
minute sleep quiz to get started and that

87
00:05:20,601 --> 00:05:24,980
will help ensure that they can build a
mattress or pillow that you will love the

88
00:05:24,981 --> 00:05:29,170
mattress, whatever this be spoke,
mattresses that you arrive at a,

89
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,790
we'll get to you within a week and
the shipping is completely free.

90
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:35,300
You can try the mattress for 100 nights
and if you're not completely happy,

91
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:37,220
they'll pick it up and
offer a full refund.

92
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:41,420
I tested that refund policy because I
test all of these sponsors and kick the

93
00:05:41,421 --> 00:05:41,991
tires a lot.

94
00:05:41,991 --> 00:05:46,430
We tested it and they came through and
making sure that we got ultimately the

95
00:05:46,431 --> 00:05:50,840
right mattress for my body.

100
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,370
Why?
Hello boys and girls.

101
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:14,850
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to
another episode of the Tim Ferriss show.

102
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:19,320
[inaudible],
my beautiful little [inaudible] this show,

103
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:24,060
as some of you may know, is about
deconstructing world class performers,

104
00:06:24,061 --> 00:06:29,040
teasing out the habits, routines, life
lessons, thought processes, frameworks,

105
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:32,400
and so on from people in
many different industries,

106
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:37,200
many different areas of expertise that
you can hopefully apply to your own lives.

107
00:06:37,201 --> 00:06:42,201
And my guest today is Steve Jurvetson
who really has his hand in many,

108
00:06:43,081 --> 00:06:47,520
many different worlds. You can say
hello to him on Twitter at DFJ. Steve,

109
00:06:47,521 --> 00:06:48,900
he is a venture capitalists,

110
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,850
but a lot more than that
focused on founder led mission
driven companies at the

111
00:06:53,851 --> 00:06:57,690
cutting edge of disruptive technology.
Now you might think to yourself,

112
00:06:57,691 --> 00:07:00,870
well that's what I might hear
many venture capitalists say,

113
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:05,070
but he was recommended to me
by a past guest as a guest,

114
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,780
Matt Mullenweg who I trust
very implicitly. And uh,

115
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,050
to give you an idea of the street cred,

116
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:14,790
he has been the founding venture capital
investor in for public companies and

117
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:18,180
many rapidly growing companies
like planet Memphis, meats,

118
00:07:18,181 --> 00:07:21,570
mythic and Nirvana and e r. V. Nirvana.

119
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:26,370
He also led investments in startups that
were later collectively acquired for

120
00:07:26,371 --> 00:07:29,070
$12 billion.
Probably much more at this point.

121
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:33,060
Before cofounding the firm,
DFJ draper Fisher,

122
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:36,320
Jurvetson Steve was a r and d
engineer at Hewlett Packard,

123
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:39,690
worked in product marketing
at apple and next many,

124
00:07:39,691 --> 00:07:44,220
many stories about his mentors there and
then spent a short stint in management

125
00:07:44,221 --> 00:07:45,300
consulting at Bain.

126
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:48,510
He completed his electrical engineering
degree at Stanford and two and a half

127
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:50,460
years.
Think about that for a second.

128
00:07:50,461 --> 00:07:54,750
Graduating number one in his class and
went on to earn all sorts of degrees,

129
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,820
MSW, NBA, et cetera.

130
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:01,740
In 2016 President Barack Obama appointed
Steve as a presidential ambassador for

131
00:08:01,741 --> 00:08:02,880
global entrepreneurship.

132
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:08,210
Steve was also chosen as one of tech's
best venture investors and quote by

133
00:08:08,341 --> 00:08:12,780
Forbes and as the venture capitalist
of the Europe by Deloitte. Steve,

134
00:08:12,781 --> 00:08:16,260
we'll be launching a brand new venture
fund sometime later this year and you can

135
00:08:16,261 --> 00:08:19,050
read about it@future.ventures,

136
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:23,700
so not future.com but future.ventures.

137
00:08:23,701 --> 00:08:25,740
That's how you would spell it out.
Not surprisingly,

138
00:08:25,741 --> 00:08:29,190
he will be focusing on passionate
founders who are on a mission to make the

139
00:08:29,191 --> 00:08:33,090
world a better place with a penchant
for unique ideas and disruptive

140
00:08:33,091 --> 00:08:36,960
technologies.
And disruptive may be an overused term,

141
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:41,640
but Steve really understands what that
means and we dig into some very, very,

142
00:08:41,641 --> 00:08:46,440
very specific examples that might make
your mind explode. So without further ado,

143
00:08:46,441 --> 00:08:51,330
please enjoy this wide ranging
conversation with Steve Jurvetson.

144
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,980
Steve,
welcome to the show.

145
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,270
Thank you.
Come here.

146
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:02,280
I am looking here at all my notes when
you were kind enough to send links to

147
00:09:02,281 --> 00:09:05,790
various resources,
interviews, discussions,

148
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:10,650
and I have to tell you I feel a little
overwhelmed because usually I have

149
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:12,240
someone on the shell.
It's like, all right,

150
00:09:12,241 --> 00:09:14,700
we have person a and they're
really good at rock climbing.

151
00:09:14,701 --> 00:09:18,600
I think we'll start with rock climbing
and in this case we're not even going to

152
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:22,320
cover 10% of the notes that I have in
front of me and they've already been

153
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,510
winnowed down.
But there is,

154
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:29,540
I think one story that I came upon that
I'd love for you to describe for people

155
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:35,870
just as a starting point and it's a quote
and then you can give the background

156
00:09:36,151 --> 00:09:40,590
from Professor David Deutsch out
of Oxford. And it begins with,

157
00:09:40,591 --> 00:09:41,730
and please correct me if I'm wrong,

158
00:09:41,731 --> 00:09:45,780
the only way this computer can be
as powerful as it is dot, dot, dot.

159
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:49,620
What does this quote? Sure. Um,

160
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,150
and I may be paraphrasing cause it's,
uh, stuff you wrote back in 2002,

161
00:09:54,151 --> 00:09:58,290
2001 at least I read the book fabric or
valid in 2002 and he's talking about the

162
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:01,620
power of quantum mechanics and the
potential for quantum computers.

163
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,900
And in so doing,

164
00:10:03,901 --> 00:10:07,560
he and Richard Fineman both realized that
a quantum computer to be fundamentally

165
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:10,190
unlike anything we have
in this world today. Uh,

166
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:14,730
and the way that quote roughly ends is
that the only way to explain the power of

167
00:10:14,731 --> 00:10:19,590
these computers is to invoke the
notion that it is sort of engaging the

168
00:10:19,591 --> 00:10:21,420
resources across parallel universes.

169
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:24,510
That if you just use the
resources of one university,

170
00:10:24,511 --> 00:10:26,700
now there's so much you can do.
But in this case,

171
00:10:26,701 --> 00:10:28,800
you actually are in the most poetic sense,

172
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:32,100
harnessing almost refractive echoes
across apparel universities to do

173
00:10:32,101 --> 00:10:33,900
computation in a
fundamentally different way.

174
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,680
And that usually bends the
mind of most scientists,

175
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,770
even physicists to the point of
breaking or looking the other way.

176
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,420
And the common response to this is,

177
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,290
I don't understand one bit of
that and it had me captivated.

178
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:51,650
So I want to jump into a number of
areas that I know nothing about or very

179
00:10:52,651 --> 00:10:53,220
little about,

180
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:57,110
even though I might use the
words occasionally as people
who spent a lot of time

181
00:10:57,111 --> 00:10:58,830
in silicon valley are,
are want to do,

182
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,320
but for people who don't
have the background,

183
00:11:01,321 --> 00:11:04,680
I want to highlight a few things
about you or actually one,

184
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,990
just as we're delving into
some of the science. Sure.

185
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:10,710
So your background or a lot of
your background is engineering.

186
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:12,350
So electrical engineering,

187
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,170
I tried doing bachelor's and master's
and started a phd and you were able to do

188
00:11:16,171 --> 00:11:19,680
so much of that partially because you
finished your Undergrad in two and a half

189
00:11:19,681 --> 00:11:22,920
years. That's right. Okay. The
point I wanted to make with that,

190
00:11:22,921 --> 00:11:26,540
and we're gonna come back to that because
I don't know how that even happens, uh,

191
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,460
is that you have technical literacy,

192
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,790
but also learning like a child.
Right?

193
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:37,791
So can you walk us through one of the
terms I was hoping to understand for

194
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:42,250
myself and that is quantum computing.
What is a quantum computer, right? Uh,

195
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,790
a quantum computer is a device.

196
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:49,380
It's usually something that is either
cooled down to almost absolute zero or has

197
00:11:49,381 --> 00:11:53,620
some other phenomenon that
it takes advantage of that
is at the edge of what is

198
00:11:53,621 --> 00:11:55,990
the known universe.
Meaning when you cool something to zero,

199
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:59,400
behavior of materials changes
dramatically if you have a superconductor.

200
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:02,320
The way it works is dramatically
different from normal conductors.

201
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:06,700
And so what people have found is that
rather than look at quantum mechanics as

202
00:12:06,701 --> 00:12:11,020
something that is spooky and bizarre the
way a Albert Einstein even described it,

203
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:12,760
this spooky action at a distance,

204
00:12:12,761 --> 00:12:17,170
this ability to entangle things to have
them to have their fates intermingled

205
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:22,240
can be not just used for things like
really unbreakable cryptography and data

206
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:25,120
transmission. It could also be used in
a very bizarre way to build a computer.

207
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,091
And this computer,

208
00:12:26,091 --> 00:12:31,091
it looks something like a row of let's
say rings that are either magnetically in

209
00:12:31,121 --> 00:12:33,520
one direction or the other. You can
think of it in a traditional computer,

210
00:12:33,521 --> 00:12:34,660
it's a one or a zero,

211
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,810
but actually it can be everything
in between simultaneously.

212
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:40,780
Much like when you dive into
how an Adam actually works,

213
00:12:40,781 --> 00:12:43,030
there isn't an electron any given point.
It's a cloud.

214
00:12:43,031 --> 00:12:46,570
It's a probability function
around the Adam. Well,

215
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:49,600
that cloud is something we're
not used to in the real world.

216
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,410
We're used to the statistical aggregation
of many items and it's like there's a

217
00:12:53,411 --> 00:12:55,540
table. It's hard. I can't put
my hand through the table.

218
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:59,080
It's not sometimes here and sometimes
over there, but the farther down you look,

219
00:12:59,081 --> 00:13:01,150
the closer and closer to,
let's say the atomic scale,

220
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,870
you notice the behavior of physics becomes
quantum physics and rather than being

221
00:13:04,871 --> 00:13:05,681
something spooky,

222
00:13:05,681 --> 00:13:08,440
you can actually harness this to
compute in a very peculiar way,

223
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:11,890
in a way that in a very,
in a very simple level,

224
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:15,580
you could say it's as if all of your
memory bank and the computer was a one and

225
00:13:15,581 --> 00:13:19,090
a zero simultaneously. So you
instantly jump or tunnel to the answer.

226
00:13:19,091 --> 00:13:20,500
You're looking forward
to particular problem.

227
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:24,100
So rather than exhaustively searching
millions or billions or trillions of

228
00:13:24,101 --> 00:13:27,640
possibilities to find, let's say the
key that unlocks it digital lock,

229
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,380
you just jump to the answer.

230
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:35,980
That's a seemingly science fiction.
But these,

231
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:40,660
these computers do exist. Yes. Um, and
even within scientific communities,

232
00:13:40,661 --> 00:13:43,630
there's some backbiting that says, well
wait, do they really exist as this one?

233
00:13:43,631 --> 00:13:45,860
An example is that just
a fast analog computer?

234
00:13:45,861 --> 00:13:50,010
So it is at the edge of a what
people believe is possible. And uh,

235
00:13:50,011 --> 00:13:53,080
I think we actually need literally
at this period of history where these

236
00:13:53,081 --> 00:13:54,520
computers are starting to come out.

237
00:13:54,521 --> 00:13:58,840
I've been on the board of directors
of one for Gosh over 15 years now.

238
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:01,580
So I was a little early and thinking
when this was ready for prime time.

239
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,880
It's now at the point where,
for example,

240
00:14:03,881 --> 00:14:06,810
Google says that their quantum computer
that they bought from a company called D

241
00:14:06,811 --> 00:14:07,900
wave outperforms,

242
00:14:07,901 --> 00:14:11,670
they're entitled to entire data center
on certain computational tasks and that

243
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,700
are important to what they do.

244
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:16,180
And other tasks that are meant
to really show how fast is it.

245
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:20,290
They found 100 million fold speed up over
the best computer they could buy from

246
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:22,810
anyone else.
How big is such a quantum computer?

247
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,230
They're almost all about the same size.
Not because the computer is big,

248
00:14:26,231 --> 00:14:29,350
but because the cooling apparatus and the
shielding from me that it flux is high.

249
00:14:29,351 --> 00:14:32,650
So thinking about a refrigerator size,
slightly bigger like two refrigerators,

250
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:36,190
the actual computer is just done a little
silicon ship that's as small as any

251
00:14:36,191 --> 00:14:36,850
other silicon chip.

252
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:40,870
It's just cool to literally 500 times
colder than the most remote part of outer

253
00:14:40,871 --> 00:14:44,440
space. I mean like a few Milli
Kelvin above absolute zero,

254
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:49,560
which is really cool too to put
the speed for power in perspective.

255
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,960
Uh, could you please describe a
graph that I've seen you present,

256
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:00,710
which I believe might start with,
is it 2002 right.

257
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,960
And it looks like it,

258
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:06,410
it progresses up to the right
almost out of a 45 degree angle.

259
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:09,800
Now that the angle is, is that important?
I mean it depends on what's on the axes,

260
00:15:09,801 --> 00:15:13,820
but uh,
could you describe what these different,

261
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,200
what these points are points represent?

262
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:19,070
It's something I have affectionately
called roses law with a sort of homage to

263
00:15:19,071 --> 00:15:22,340
Moore's law. Um, because Moore's law
is actually named by carver mead.

264
00:15:22,341 --> 00:15:26,670
It wasn't Gordon Moore himself who labeled
his law Moore's law and nor did nor

265
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:28,110
did Jordy rose,
the founder of D-Wave.

266
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:31,720
But when I was first speaking with him
in 2002 having just read David Deutsch,

267
00:15:31,721 --> 00:15:33,890
his book,
he had produced a single cubit,

268
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,100
they're called cubits for like quantum
bits. So I'll just use the acronym cubit.

269
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:41,270
He had manufactured one of these untested
and characterized it and had sent to

270
00:15:41,271 --> 00:15:43,760
the manufacturing facility. It was
the cubit, the entire computer.

271
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:47,250
And think of it as a buy loosen algae,
like a memory array.

272
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,220
It would be like a one bit memory ray.
Got It.

273
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,600
That's a really powerful memory rate.

274
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:54,800
So when you go from one to two u s you're
now able to explore all possibilities

275
00:15:54,801 --> 00:15:58,550
of two to the second power of, so for
memory states, if you have three cubits,

276
00:15:58,551 --> 00:16:01,520
you could simultaneously explored eight
possible memory states if you have four

277
00:16:01,521 --> 00:16:05,330
16 and so forth. Right? It's a
doubling. So as you add a single cubit,

278
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,730
you've roughly,
even by with some hand waving,

279
00:16:07,731 --> 00:16:11,420
doubled the power of your computer roughly
speaking on the order of a two to the

280
00:16:11,421 --> 00:16:15,110
end phenomenon. So if you were
to add one new cubit every year,

281
00:16:15,111 --> 00:16:17,690
which he just stayed it. So coming
to like where this graph come from,

282
00:16:17,691 --> 00:16:21,530
he just stayed in 2002 I think we're
going to double the number of cubits and a

283
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:24,290
functional quantum computer
every year in perpetuity.

284
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,200
And so I had to ask is that just because
Gordon Moore said something that sounds

285
00:16:27,201 --> 00:16:30,560
kind of similar and we had a conversation,

286
00:16:30,561 --> 00:16:33,760
I don't remember being particularly
persuaded other than it's a semiconductor

287
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:36,560
process. It takes roughly a year. Did
that just the prior generation? Yeah,

288
00:16:36,561 --> 00:16:39,110
we should. We should. Why shouldn't we
be able to do this? And sure enough,

289
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:42,950
that's helpful today. Right? So
that's been 16 years of doublings.

290
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:46,850
The way the graph gets interesting
though is as with Moore's law,

291
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,610
it comes out of nowhere.
Like, so Moore's law,

292
00:16:49,611 --> 00:16:52,010
you get to actually trace
back hundreds of years,

293
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:55,370
arguably that our capacity to compute
as a species has been doubling roughly

294
00:16:55,371 --> 00:16:58,850
every year since we started to compute,
since we had any kind of advocates.

295
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,760
I mean like it's kind of weird how this
has been growing and the semiconductor

296
00:17:01,761 --> 00:17:04,700
industry is just the modern version
of that on a quantum computer.

297
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:09,140
That doubling starts to reach thresholds
where you can do things that you

298
00:17:09,141 --> 00:17:11,960
couldn't do with any computer on earth.
So on this graph he was,

299
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,990
if you look forward and here's where
there's been a little bit of a time delay

300
00:17:14,991 --> 00:17:17,950
by the way, just to full disclosure,
where the power something's computers,

301
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,260
there has been a bit of overhead,
there's been a bit of, you know,

302
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,740
set up and read out times.

303
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:25,850
There's been a bit of noise and other
things that have made the power of it not,

304
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:29,270
it's still scales like the original curve,
like that 45 degree angle.

305
00:17:29,271 --> 00:17:32,530
You're painting in people's minds.
But the power that that represents is,

306
00:17:32,531 --> 00:17:33,800
you know,
imagine you have to go like a little,

307
00:17:33,801 --> 00:17:35,990
maybe two or four times bigger
to hit some of these thresholds,

308
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,720
but unless something falls off the rails,

309
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:42,110
we will soon and like the next couple
of years have computers that can

310
00:17:42,111 --> 00:17:43,610
outperform any computer on earth.

311
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,090
Then you give it another couple of years
and it would outperform all computers

312
00:17:47,091 --> 00:17:48,380
that could ever be built on earth,

313
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:50,880
even if you use entire matter
of the earth to build them.

314
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,880
And then this is where David Deutsch
started to run this thought process out,

315
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,200
give it another couple of years.

316
00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:00,030
He would outperform all computers that
could possibly be built if you use the

317
00:18:00,031 --> 00:18:04,890
entire matter of the universe as at your
disposal to build in the best possible

318
00:18:04,891 --> 00:18:06,360
computer.
Any human could ever design.

319
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,570
And you gave it the length of the
university and time to work on a problem.

320
00:18:09,571 --> 00:18:12,090
It's still couldn't solve these
problems and the quantum cuter could.

321
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:14,220
And in due course like
in less than an hour,

322
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:17,580
like that's when if your head hasn't
already drilled out of your ears,

323
00:18:17,581 --> 00:18:22,581
it just really explodes like pulp and
what there's places where nature gives you

324
00:18:23,221 --> 00:18:25,800
a peak into its wonders, right?
And as a scientist or engineer,

325
00:18:25,801 --> 00:18:28,050
we get these in almost
any field of exploration,

326
00:18:28,051 --> 00:18:31,470
whether it's innerspace of quantum physics
or outer space and the frontiers of

327
00:18:31,471 --> 00:18:32,160
the unknown.

328
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,420
And here's one of those examples that
just opens your eyes to how little we know

329
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,920
in that you'll sometimes see
this may be an experiment. Um,

330
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:44,310
I give an example of one that David
Deutsch also likes that some people might

331
00:18:44,311 --> 00:18:46,970
remember from your high school
physics. If you have two slits, um,

332
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,750
two very narrow slits and
you shine light through them,

333
00:18:48,751 --> 00:18:51,180
you get this diffraction
pattern on a screen,

334
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:53,370
on the falling on the
wrong side of the table.

335
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,420
And that's always been
something we learned at the
bulk statistical physics of a

336
00:18:57,421 --> 00:19:00,030
lot of photons, a lot of lights going
and interfering with each other.

337
00:19:00,031 --> 00:19:01,940
It was interference patterns.
Well,

338
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:05,160
it's fascinating is if you
send single photons at a time,

339
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:08,910
they will shoot through and if
you just tally up to statistics,

340
00:19:08,911 --> 00:19:13,680
they'll end up creating a distribution
pattern just as if it were many photons

341
00:19:13,681 --> 00:19:15,240
interacting.
So the whole explanation,

342
00:19:15,241 --> 00:19:17,790
the wave theory of light is that
waves interact with each other,

343
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:21,060
and that's what creates this pattern
is ripple pattern on the other side.

344
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:24,180
But there's no interaction when you're
single and single photon at a time.

345
00:19:24,181 --> 00:19:27,120
It's not interacting with anything other
than its sister photon in a parallel

346
00:19:27,121 --> 00:19:29,790
universe. Right. And David
Joyce, she was like, well,

347
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:33,840
that's obviously the explanation that
makes all of this work other than it bends

348
00:19:33,841 --> 00:19:36,780
people's minds. And so the two schools
of thought are, that's the answer,

349
00:19:36,781 --> 00:19:41,200
or I don't want to talk about it.
What is David's background? Is He, oh,

350
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,340
he's a physicist, but yeah. Yeah. Just
to make sure. Yes, absolutely. No,

351
00:19:44,341 --> 00:19:48,990
he knows a lot way more than me
because he's not a charlatan.

352
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:53,550
Yeah.
How do you even make sense of that?

353
00:19:53,551 --> 00:19:57,390
I mean in terms of considering the
implications because this isn't,

354
00:19:57,391 --> 00:19:59,280
we're not talking about thousands
of years away potentially,

355
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,850
and this is in the
relatively near term future.

356
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:07,860
What are the implications of that? So the
key to answering that question as well,

357
00:20:07,861 --> 00:20:09,120
what are these computers good for?
Right.

358
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:11,970
And either good news or bad news depending
on your point of view is they're very

359
00:20:11,971 --> 00:20:12,804
hard to program,

360
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:17,130
at least historically speaking is a years
would go by between major advances in

361
00:20:17,131 --> 00:20:17,941
the software,
if you will,

362
00:20:17,941 --> 00:20:20,790
the algorithms that one can run on a
quantum computer and do anything useful.

363
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,080
Right.

364
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,790
There was something called
shores algorithm that came
out a few years back that

365
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:25,440
said, hey, you can
actually factor integers,

366
00:20:25,441 --> 00:20:28,230
meaning break the number
15 into its prime factors.

367
00:20:28,231 --> 00:20:31,920
Three times five is 15 so if I give you
15 tell me what the prime factors are.

368
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,390
You know,
if the number is small,

369
00:20:33,391 --> 00:20:36,570
we can kind of work our way randomly
threw it through either exhaustive search

370
00:20:36,571 --> 00:20:39,750
or some heuristic, but we don't really
have a mathematical way to get the answer.

371
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:42,420
And the quantum computer now
can just give you the answer,

372
00:20:42,421 --> 00:20:45,340
which it turns out would break
most of cryptography. Um,

373
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,490
any of these mathematically symmetries
are at the core of public key crypto.

374
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:50,700
So that's kind of worrisome.
Um,

375
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:55,360
when it's useful for beyond something
that spooks should be interested in is we

376
00:20:55,361 --> 00:20:57,670
literally also in a renaissance
of software discovery.

377
00:20:57,671 --> 00:21:01,060
So things are that it really seems
to be coming to the top of near term

378
00:21:01,061 --> 00:21:04,660
opportunities or quantum chemistry and um,
deep learning or machine learning,

379
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,340
both of which are very interesting.

380
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:10,480
Quantum chemistry is quite
simply predicting accurately
what a small molecule

381
00:21:10,481 --> 00:21:11,260
will do.

382
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:14,370
It turns out if you use a normal computer
and you try to solve shortens great

383
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:17,890
Schrodinger's equations and do like the
what's called the bottoms up ab initio

384
00:21:17,891 --> 00:21:21,910
model, like what does a water
molecule do, what does aspirin do,

385
00:21:21,911 --> 00:21:25,000
how does it behave?
You can't actually model this.

386
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,710
It just computation that grinds to a halt.

387
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:29,530
A quantum computer could do this
almost on a one to one mapping.

388
00:21:29,531 --> 00:21:33,250
So the quantum computer about the same
complexity as h two o and all of its

389
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:35,110
electrons is about the size of computer.

390
00:21:35,111 --> 00:21:38,460
You'd need the model it perfectly like
when does it freeze? How this whatever,

391
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:39,340
what's phase transitions,

392
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:43,030
all these weird properties of water that
we take for granted that really don't

393
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,040
come from the physics, right?
We learned this in chemistry,

394
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:46,030
but you don't learn in physics.

395
00:21:46,031 --> 00:21:49,220
And because of the math it's
computationally to complex. Um,

396
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,340
more interesting to me
personally. I mean, by the way,

397
00:21:51,341 --> 00:21:53,470
I first invested in quantum
computing for quantum chemistry.

398
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,380
That was the reason I got excited about
this is what we'd be able to design

399
00:21:56,381 --> 00:22:00,220
drugs more quickly. Figure out, let's give
an example. Let's say you have some new,

400
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:00,640
uh,

401
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,470
h one n one virus and you're trying to
figure out how can I design a molecule

402
00:22:05,471 --> 00:22:08,680
that would dock to this virus at a
particular place that like if I could only

403
00:22:08,681 --> 00:22:12,760
attach they're chemically, I could
kill it. Well, that's very hard to do.

404
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,940
Very easy to state, very hard to
solve. So you can test a drug,

405
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,850
but you can't have an issue of
just design it out of scratch.

406
00:22:18,851 --> 00:22:22,450
And that's what these hopefully we'll be
able to do soon rapidly accelerate drug

407
00:22:22,451 --> 00:22:23,080
design.

408
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,500
The other area that has enormously wide
applicability is in deep learning and we

409
00:22:26,501 --> 00:22:28,840
can talk more about that field later.
But generally speaking,

410
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,700
building little brains that can learn
something very quickly and like let's say

411
00:22:33,701 --> 00:22:38,290
it's pattern recognition
or image recognition for
any number of applications,

412
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:43,150
um, and do that much better. So that's
why perhaps it's not surprising.

413
00:22:43,151 --> 00:22:46,270
Google's been the primary customer of
quantum computers for the last 10 years

414
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,610
cause they use deep learning everywhere.

415
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,850
So we're going to, I'm sure get to deep
learning. I shouldn't be so confident.

416
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:57,660
Well like 75 pages on it comes
back to 75 pages of notes. Sure.

417
00:22:57,661 --> 00:22:59,580
I'll do my best to come
back to deep learning folks.

418
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:05,130
I'm not yet a deep learner by clearly
with all the notes are neural networks.

419
00:23:05,131 --> 00:23:07,410
That's the same thing basically.
All right, so this is,

420
00:23:07,411 --> 00:23:09,500
you want to come back to that.
Great. All right. So I'll,

421
00:23:09,501 --> 00:23:12,330
I'll put this anonymous
on my mysterious pad here,

422
00:23:12,331 --> 00:23:15,240
but question that is

423
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,990
tangentially related,
but since you mentioned entanglement,

424
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:22,320
this is something that's become very
interesting to me as a non physicist.

425
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:27,000
Of course, my ability to dig into
it as is limited, but I heard,

426
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,580
I believe it was radio lab,
I could be making that up,

427
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:32,520
but an episode of radio lab
where they talked about the,

428
00:23:32,521 --> 00:23:37,521
some of the experimental design and
the results of using lasers to impact,

429
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:43,440
uh, entangled. Suppose it'd be
Adam's, does that sound right? Uh, or,

430
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,100
um, I'm not sure. There may be. They can

431
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,490
create what's called the booze
Isand Einstein condensate
with lasers in a sense,

432
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:53,420
trapping light and making it stop
or doing really bizarre things.

433
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:57,140
So they were looking at entanglement
across, not just distances within a room,

434
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:01,880
but I didn't know, I think they sent it
on a loop at cern or at 60, 70, 80 miles,

435
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:02,720
which,
right.

436
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,890
And so I started wondering myself again
as like a professional amateur is not

437
00:24:06,891 --> 00:24:10,310
terribly good at any one thing. It's
was like, well, wait a second. If, if,

438
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,560
if you were to ask David Deutsch,

439
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:13,550
she might just laugh this
off as a ridiculous question,

440
00:24:13,551 --> 00:24:18,500
but if the Big Bang theory
or if the big bang happened,

441
00:24:18,501 --> 00:24:22,100
as many people imagine it to have happened
or, or think of too to have happened,

442
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:26,720
is it possible that everything
that we can see, hear, feel,

443
00:24:26,721 --> 00:24:28,550
touch is entangled?
Like is,

444
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:31,880
is there the possibility that
everything is entangled anyway?

445
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,610
That's a question that I think about,
but I've never asked a physicist.

446
00:24:34,611 --> 00:24:35,810
I'm not sure. Not, not in the,

447
00:24:35,811 --> 00:24:40,070
well my gut is not in the powerful way
that the quantum theory takes advantage

448
00:24:40,071 --> 00:24:44,830
of it, but there is the possibility
of, well first off, let me just,

449
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,580
for those who don't know
the experiment referring to,

450
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:51,560
they sent two entangled photons down sort
of opposing fiber optic rings and then

451
00:24:51,561 --> 00:24:54,290
when they were far apart from each other,
like miles apart from each other,

452
00:24:54,291 --> 00:24:58,010
they would observe one and notice
that the other resolve that state

453
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,750
instantaneously at the same time.

454
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:03,200
So in other words that there's this
notion of quantum indeterminacy that you

455
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:05,930
don't know whether it's a one or a zero
or somewhere routine until you look at

456
00:25:05,931 --> 00:25:08,600
it, the moment you look at
it, it changes the state.

457
00:25:08,601 --> 00:25:13,601
It's this really both strange and and
provocatively provocative notion of the

458
00:25:14,781 --> 00:25:15,614
quantum physics.

459
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:18,710
And literally if you look at one of them
over let's say on left field, you know,

460
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:19,700
miles away,

461
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:24,320
it'll instantaneously resolve the other
one as well as if they were a single

462
00:25:24,321 --> 00:25:27,080
unit.
And in fact you can't have,

463
00:25:27,081 --> 00:25:29,870
like you can't imagine information passing
between them because it's faster than

464
00:25:29,871 --> 00:25:33,050
the speed of light that this is like
it's at the exact same moment that these

465
00:25:33,051 --> 00:25:35,890
things resolve. Oh, I'm coming,

466
00:25:35,891 --> 00:25:38,380
I'm going to get out of
my depth on the takeaway.

467
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:40,340
I think the main takeaway
that fascinated me,

468
00:25:40,341 --> 00:25:44,570
and maybe the hopefully every listener
is we are just beginning to scratch the

469
00:25:44,571 --> 00:25:47,330
surface of understanding
what these phenomenon are
about and taking advantage of

470
00:25:47,331 --> 00:25:51,590
them in any useful way. Right. So
usually quantum physicists literally for,

471
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:52,453
you know,

472
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:56,630
since the beginning of the field have
been more theoretical than experimental,

473
00:25:56,810 --> 00:26:00,320
more a bit more theoretical than
useful. You know, it might you say,

474
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:04,880
and I think the potential crashing of
this onto business shores is potentially

475
00:26:04,881 --> 00:26:07,520
upon us where, uh, again,
when we talk about it,

476
00:26:07,521 --> 00:26:08,480
let's say the power of deep learning,

477
00:26:08,481 --> 00:26:12,230
if you could build an
artificial intelligence
broadly defined of any kind is

478
00:26:12,231 --> 00:26:16,250
simple one that plays games or a simple
one that recognizes cancer in, you know,

479
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:21,080
pathology slides or recognizes,
uh, anything in an x ray
in medical imaging sense.

480
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,270
If you can do that better
than anyone else on earth,

481
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:24,860
that's a business opportunity.

482
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:29,270
And that capability might start to lend
itself to those who have the cutting

483
00:26:29,271 --> 00:26:30,770
edge of computation.
And in the past,

484
00:26:30,771 --> 00:26:33,830
anyone could buy a computer
and catch up with, you know,

485
00:26:33,831 --> 00:26:36,530
someone who has another computer.
It was a commodity, right? I just,

486
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,390
we'll just go buy some
more computers myself.

487
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:43,310
But what if the practitioners of
this sort of field are so esoteric,

488
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:47,010
limited that there's only a handful of
companies that know how to do powerful

489
00:26:47,011 --> 00:26:49,890
computing. That's kind of a
worrisome feature, potentially.

490
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:55,140
Not to dedicate too much time
to worry some futures, but what,

491
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:00,200
what do you see as the
most likely existential or
greatest existential risks to

492
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,170
humans, animals, people,
things on this planet? Oh,

493
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:08,880
I think it'd be very different for humans,
animals and things.

494
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:09,910
Let's talk about that.
Yeah.

495
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,290
Because I think there's all kinds of
things we can do to hurt ourselves that

496
00:27:13,291 --> 00:27:14,390
nature won't have any problem with.

497
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:17,520
And all these like March right along the
cockroaches will still be out there, uh,

498
00:27:17,521 --> 00:27:21,690
for many years. Um, since my cockroach
audience is still very small,

499
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,880
we'll go with humans.
They're incredible creatures.

500
00:27:23,881 --> 00:27:25,920
They're going how they're going
to laugh through a lot. So, um,

501
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:31,640
I worry about the way in
which cultural evolution is,

502
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:34,380
while it's progressing,

503
00:27:34,381 --> 00:27:38,820
it's not progressing fast enough and
we as a society are going through more

504
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,050
rapid and gut wrenching change of
various sorts that we may or may not be

505
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:47,430
prepared to handle. So, for example,
we may be in the midst, I would argue,

506
00:27:47,431 --> 00:27:51,810
have a ever accelerating rich poor gap
that politicians and policymakers just

507
00:27:51,811 --> 00:27:55,980
don't have their head around and could
lead to a future of abundance is Peter

508
00:27:55,980 --> 00:28:00,000
Diamandis writes about where everything's
great because physical things are so

509
00:28:00,001 --> 00:28:03,600
inexpensive that even the poorest of the
poor can live like kings of just a few

510
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,970
years prior. Um, but I
think the cultural, um,

511
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:12,330
in a sense set up for this
is not necessarily right,

512
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:16,680
which is we don't have a lot of people
thinking about it. Whether it's, you know,

513
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,780
how will,
let's say 10 years from now,

514
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:21,240
20 years now we provide for
basic human needs globally.

515
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:23,400
Is it going to be normal
capitalism in a democracy?

516
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:26,400
Is that going to work just fine for
everyone or will it be some that are

517
00:28:26,401 --> 00:28:28,760
horribly left behind? And I think, um,

518
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:32,200
social unrest is something that
worries me more and more, I guess in,

519
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,450
in a succinct way.
Um,

520
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:37,230
there are other things I've been involved
with a nonprofit looking for, you know,

521
00:28:37,231 --> 00:28:38,340
astroid defense.

522
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:41,100
That's an existential threat of
another kind that's easily addressed.

523
00:28:41,101 --> 00:28:42,900
I mean for you know,
less than $400 million,

524
00:28:42,901 --> 00:28:46,150
you could take that one off the table.
So hopefully that will happen. Um,

525
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:51,300
pandemic flu or bioterrorism, pause for
a second. So take it off the table by Oh,

526
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:53,370
so somehow destroying the nose.

527
00:28:53,371 --> 00:28:55,170
It key is just detecting them
long before they hit her.

528
00:28:55,171 --> 00:28:57,150
It's so unlike the movies
Armageddon or deep impact,

529
00:28:57,151 --> 00:28:59,840
you don't want to wait until final
approach to try and do anything about it

530
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:01,800
seems like a good breaking it apart.

531
00:29:01,801 --> 00:29:05,550
It turns a bolt until shotgun shell like
it's way too late. What you want to do,

532
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:06,360
and it's actually,

533
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:11,040
this is what's so interesting is for the
first time ever we can put satellites

534
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:13,800
up that had these infrared sensors
that can detect these objects at great

535
00:29:13,801 --> 00:29:18,330
distances and track them and
we have enough computational
power to from a couple

536
00:29:18,331 --> 00:29:19,920
of them,
a lot from three observation points,

537
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:24,240
model out the inbody problem of what
will the next hundred years of this

538
00:29:24,241 --> 00:29:27,720
object's orbit look like and will it hit
earth at any point in the next hundred

539
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,840
years? So that that is a computationally
complex thing we can do today.

540
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:34,230
So putting up one of those
satellites in a near Venus orbit,

541
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:37,800
looking out to capture all the threads
to earth we could do today with less

542
00:29:37,801 --> 00:29:39,810
budget than some museums have.
Right.

543
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,530
And the key then is when you see
something that will hit earth,

544
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:46,000
let's say 50 years from now or 30
years from now, you just bump it.

545
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:50,200
All you have to do is like give it the
slightest little Delta v today and all of

546
00:29:50,201 --> 00:29:53,410
its orbits around the Sun. By the time
it eventually intersects with earth,

547
00:29:53,411 --> 00:29:55,990
it's in a totally different place
and we can computationally no,

548
00:29:55,991 --> 00:29:59,890
yeah he was rear ended by a tiny bit or
hit it head on by a tiny bit and then

549
00:29:59,891 --> 00:30:02,410
you're done. Right. Problem solved. Wow.

550
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:06,310
But you need time on your side that
it takes years for that tiny nudge to

551
00:30:06,311 --> 00:30:09,490
accumulate enough distance delta that
you miss something as big as earth.

552
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:12,070
So interrupted.
I think your segue to bioterrorism,

553
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:16,270
bioterrorism worried me a lot post nine
11 cause I realized looking into it and

554
00:30:16,271 --> 00:30:19,840
from investments I'd made
that it's increasingly
becoming the case that a small

555
00:30:19,841 --> 00:30:23,500
number of people in fact individual with
let's say a college education in this

556
00:30:23,501 --> 00:30:26,620
field could build weapons of mass
destruction. It used to take armies,

557
00:30:26,621 --> 00:30:27,670
it used to take,
you know,

558
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:32,170
despots and fascist leaders of countries
and resources of countries to wield a

559
00:30:32,171 --> 00:30:35,140
weapon of mass destruction to build
going to the CRISPR gene editing,

560
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:38,900
things like that. Yeah, exactly. So, you
know, synthesizing smallpox, you know,

561
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:42,610
weaponizing it, doing something like
in injecting the interleukin four gene,

562
00:30:42,611 --> 00:30:45,580
which makes it incredibly deadly in,
in mouse pox.

563
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:49,390
Pox viruses affect all organisms that
get to a certain concentration level and

564
00:30:49,391 --> 00:30:52,840
the planet. So aunts, dear,
anything that live in dense areas,

565
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:56,050
chickenpox develop a unique
pox virus for that thing.

566
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:58,660
It's kind of nature's way of telling you
there's way too many of you people on

567
00:30:58,661 --> 00:31:02,350
this planet than the um,
they can be bio engineered like crazy.

568
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:06,520
And this worried me because when I
spoke to people in various government

569
00:31:06,521 --> 00:31:10,180
agencies who spend their time modeling
and doing red team simulations of

570
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:12,910
bioterrorism outbreaks, there
only answer at the time was, well,

571
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:14,380
we hope they wouldn't do this.

572
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:19,060
I just kind of like a leap of faith that
this is such a horrible thing to wield

573
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:21,610
that that people would stop short.
And at the time I,

574
00:31:21,611 --> 00:31:24,790
they gave me no comfort
and as time passes,

575
00:31:24,791 --> 00:31:26,590
I'm actually think there is
an element of truth to that.

576
00:31:26,591 --> 00:31:29,890
That's not the kind of thing that typical
terrorist cell can get someone fired

577
00:31:29,891 --> 00:31:34,180
up about it. There is a weird
thing, even within the worst,

578
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:37,970
if whatever we put in quote marks, worst
parts of societal, uh, troublemakers,

579
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,750
if you will, on the planet where this
isn't a place they tend to go, right?

580
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:44,110
Flying a plane in a building is more
natural vector of getting attention for

581
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:47,560
your mission and getting someone to
volunteer for the duty than saying, oh,

582
00:31:47,561 --> 00:31:49,760
I'm going to go kill a bunch of
innocent people. You know, with,

583
00:31:49,761 --> 00:31:53,560
with a contagious agent, it's kind
of weird cross product of a threat.

584
00:31:53,561 --> 00:31:56,980
How did you convince yourself of that?
Why am I worried about it too? Okay. Yeah.

585
00:31:56,981 --> 00:32:00,910
It's on my top three list of worries.
Yeah. What are the others? Um, let's see.

586
00:32:00,911 --> 00:32:05,440
Let's see. The inequality slash
unrest. Um, bioterrorism. Oh shoot.

587
00:32:05,441 --> 00:32:09,940
What is my other one? Uh,
well, climate change of course.
Oh my God. Climate Change.

588
00:32:09,941 --> 00:32:13,240
She said the thing about climate change
that worries me is the things I didn't

589
00:32:13,241 --> 00:32:14,470
know.
I'll give one example.

590
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,320
Last week I learned of a new thing that
I really didn't learn to worry about

591
00:32:17,321 --> 00:32:20,830
until last week,
which is of all places out of NASA ames,

592
00:32:20,831 --> 00:32:23,740
the former director was telling me they'd
been doing these interesting studies

593
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:26,110
trying to figure out how can we
induce hibernation and mammals,

594
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:29,170
which for interstellar travel
would be great. You know,
then the movies, the human,

595
00:32:29,171 --> 00:32:30,760
somehow I'll go into hibernation mode,
right?

596
00:32:30,761 --> 00:32:32,080
And then all in all the movies we see,

597
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:35,200
and then we're doing studies with rats
and they could actually get rats to

598
00:32:35,201 --> 00:32:39,040
hibernate for two days at a time by
exposing to the hydrogen sulfide.

599
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:42,380
And that immediately led me to ask,
well, wait, why is that adaptive? I owed,

600
00:32:42,381 --> 00:32:46,160
we have this sort of latent pathway that
really doesn't seem useful for anything

601
00:32:46,161 --> 00:32:50,180
that puts rats to sleep for two days
at a time and they would die if it was

602
00:32:50,181 --> 00:32:53,660
longer than that and it turned out back.
One of the major extinction events,

603
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:56,540
and I'll try to be more concise
here than I might otherwise be.

604
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,600
If there was a major volcanic,
we have plenty of numbers.

605
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:03,290
It led to major climate change and the
polar ice caps melted a greenhouse gas

606
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,320
greenhouse effect in the
palm of the ice caps melting.

607
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,970
Wasn't that sea level levels Rose
Rose that just affects Bangladesh,

608
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:13,640
Miami and Yup, but it doesn't take
out humanity if sea levels rise,

609
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:17,360
the thing that could take out humanity
is it's the ocean current start,

610
00:33:17,361 --> 00:33:21,710
stop going and part of that was driven
by a freshwater or melt off the pulse.

611
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:25,610
So potentially long before the polls are
completely gone or perhaps completely

612
00:33:25,611 --> 00:33:28,250
unrelated, the temperature change.
If the ocean stops circulating,

613
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:33,440
you get this complete dead zones
where there's organisms depend on the

614
00:33:33,441 --> 00:33:38,441
circulation of nutrients to survive and
basically purple and brown bacteria took

615
00:33:38,451 --> 00:33:40,480
over and they are these
hydrogen sulfide is,

616
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:44,780
you'd have these waves usually coupled
up to two days at a time of just

617
00:33:44,781 --> 00:33:48,920
literally lethal gasses sweeping across
the landscape that the survivors learn

618
00:33:48,921 --> 00:33:51,050
how to hibernate through.
It's an a long winded way.

619
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,640
The thing that both was both interesting,

620
00:33:52,641 --> 00:33:55,610
like maybe here's a hint of how we can
induce hibernation and mammals like

621
00:33:55,611 --> 00:33:56,444
humans,

622
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:59,930
but also a reminder that we've had
climate change many times in this planet.

623
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:03,440
And really bad things can happen that
have nothing to do with carbon or methane

624
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:05,140
or all the things we're focused on.
Uh,

625
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,520
it could be the hydrogen
sulfide gas that kills us,

626
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:11,080
which is the rotten smell of eggs. You
know, you'll, you'll see, you know,

627
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,350
it's nasty stuff

628
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:18,920
on the social and recipes and just
because I know there are many people out

629
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:23,390
listening who will be wondering this,
what do you see as the preventative steps,

630
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:27,500
if any, that can be taken
to mitigate that risk? Yeah.

631
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:32,120
So first I was looking at it like, well,
does it feel like it's self correcting?

632
00:34:32,121 --> 00:34:33,140
Is it self rectifying?

633
00:34:33,141 --> 00:34:35,480
Is there something that's a
natural governing feedback loop,

634
00:34:35,481 --> 00:34:37,820
a negative feedback loop that
says, well, the rich get richer.

635
00:34:37,821 --> 00:34:40,610
Is there something that naturally
makes that not continue further?

636
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:44,510
And unfortunately there's a lot of
positive feedback loops, not in the, uh,

637
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,670
not in the sort of normative sense,

638
00:34:46,671 --> 00:34:50,270
but in just a regulatory sense of it
just there's a runaway thing, right?

639
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:54,980
Like runaway climate change and
that is you can get, um, well,

640
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:58,820
first off in is every business becomes
an information business over time.

641
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:02,090
Like when, what I mean by that
is if the basis of competition,

642
00:35:02,091 --> 00:35:06,080
why is company a winning over company B?
Is it the way they process information?

643
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:09,500
Is it a software layer to their business
that I think is rippling through every

644
00:35:09,501 --> 00:35:12,320
part of industry, whether
it's the aerospace industry,
the automotive industry,

645
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:17,000
agriculture, right? It's
not, oh, he worked harder. He
was an artisan in his field.

646
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:20,250
That's why he's a better farmer. Or
She, it's, oh no, he's got better genes,

647
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:23,660
scripts from Monsanto or whoever.
And the basis of competition.

648
00:35:23,661 --> 00:35:27,260
Agriculture's moved to information
tech as every industry goes that way,

649
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:30,440
those industries will start to look
more like where do you see Google and

650
00:35:30,441 --> 00:35:34,760
Facebook a winner take all kind of
dynamic where eat between firms,

651
00:35:34,761 --> 00:35:37,380
you have very few winners and within
firms you have very few winners,

652
00:35:37,381 --> 00:35:39,840
so at every fractal scale it's
kind of like a winner take all.

653
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:43,050
There's a few people within these firms
that Garner most of the wealth and

654
00:35:43,051 --> 00:35:45,240
there's few companies that Garner
most of the wealth in each industry.

655
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:50,160
Now that's perhaps so that trend is
somewhat negative in that technology takes

656
00:35:50,161 --> 00:35:53,000
over more and more. It didn't
innovates more and more of the economy.

657
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:57,090
It subsumes or eats the world, if you
will, that I think it'll be a side effect.

658
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:00,900
One other side effect that's negative is
people sometimes reject maternity when

659
00:36:00,901 --> 00:36:04,590
they can't keep up. Like you sometimes
subscribe to a different belief system,

660
00:36:04,591 --> 00:36:08,040
not science and math is the progress
of vector of humanity. It's like,

661
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:09,570
I'm going to reject science,
I'm going to reject math.

662
00:36:09,571 --> 00:36:11,730
And there's entire countries
that are taking this stance,

663
00:36:11,731 --> 00:36:14,210
which is scary because
they'll fall farther,

664
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:17,400
farther behind perhaps with an inability
to catch up to maternity when and if

665
00:36:17,401 --> 00:36:20,580
they choose to. So that worries
me. The only current quote,

666
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:23,840
negative feedback loop thing that prevents
welcoming from completely crazy is

667
00:36:23,841 --> 00:36:27,040
that luckily, and I think
maybe understandably, um,

668
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:31,170
the wealthiest tech entrepreneurs tend
not to live like rock stars and you know,

669
00:36:31,171 --> 00:36:35,250
are rap stars in, in La. They tend to
give back in a simple explanation for me,

670
00:36:35,251 --> 00:36:38,790
having seen many of these people before
they made billions of dollars and after

671
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,790
is that if you've made goings at
dollars and let's say under five years,

672
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:46,650
you don't tend to ascribe that to
your incredible hard work and superior

673
00:36:46,651 --> 00:36:49,110
intelligence, right? It is a farce, right?

674
00:36:49,111 --> 00:36:51,660
To hold onto the belief that
I am better than others.

675
00:36:51,661 --> 00:36:55,080
That's why I'm a billionaire.
And so they give back like in droves.

676
00:36:55,081 --> 00:36:58,560
I like incredible acts of philanthropy.
And so right now the philanthropy, um,

677
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:03,540
governor is the one thing I see that's
at least a positive that says, well,

678
00:37:03,541 --> 00:37:07,140
maybe this actually will allow people
like gates and others to take on multi

679
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:10,290
year quests,
like eradicating malaria or polio,

680
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:14,550
now polio and next malaria in a way that
governments can't even take on, right?

681
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:18,180
You have projects that exceed
the budget of the GDP of nations.

682
00:37:18,181 --> 00:37:20,820
You have projects that exceed
the lifespan of any politician.

683
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:25,110
And luckily this is what these people
are choosing to do rather than just show

684
00:37:25,111 --> 00:37:28,010
off. Right? Uh, and so I'm
really happy about that. Um,

685
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,550
and I'm trying to live
my life that way as well.

686
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:34,380
So the question of going
forward is there's a lot of
debates about basic income,

687
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:38,790
universal basic income and experiments
that are trying to get funded to see if

688
00:37:38,791 --> 00:37:40,810
it works the way people think it might.
Um,

689
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:45,990
I think there could be all
kinds of experiments in
almost corporate health plans

690
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:49,140
writ large. So right now most companies
in the more than a thousand employees,

691
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:50,790
we'll manage the health
plan of care in place.

692
00:37:50,791 --> 00:37:52,260
It's cheaper than going to a third party,

693
00:37:52,261 --> 00:37:55,800
like I will actually pay
for your healthcare because
let me paying some third

694
00:37:55,801 --> 00:37:56,490
party,
you know,

695
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:59,340
they're just making money off that and
I've got enough critical mass with a

696
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,980
thousand employees. Does that make
sense? Well, imagine food, shelter,

697
00:38:01,981 --> 00:38:04,410
clothing and healthcare
are all equally cheap.

698
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:08,040
Meaning everything costs a dollar a pound
in the world. That's a physical thing.

699
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:08,450
That's,

700
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:10,800
that's where we're heading in the end
point was all physical things should be

701
00:38:10,801 --> 00:38:14,840
the same cost bag of potatoes,
dollar, pound, bag of chips,
dollar pound. Why Heart?

702
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,880
Because, um, and, and then what
you'll pay for is the software,

703
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:18,721
the intellectual property,

704
00:38:18,721 --> 00:38:21,560
the thing that that in certain
places could lock up the mail.

705
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:24,870
Maybe that Ferrari costs more because
it's the design, not the materials,

706
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:27,270
but it's just manufacturing
methods are all converging.

707
00:38:27,271 --> 00:38:29,670
Whether you think of it as additive
manufacturing or just traditional

708
00:38:29,671 --> 00:38:30,181
manufacturing,

709
00:38:30,181 --> 00:38:33,990
that stuff is not the rare commodity
you pay for intellectual content like

710
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,530
entertainment and software.

711
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,610
It's like that's what all feature Connie's
will based on in physical stuff's all

712
00:38:38,611 --> 00:38:42,220
at the same. What are the
means of manufacturer? Well,

713
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:43,631
we're going to grow things.

714
00:38:43,631 --> 00:38:46,400
I think increasingly in the future
I think we're going to grow, uh,

715
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,440
with algae and other things, chemicals
like so we think much sheer, you know,

716
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,390
metric tons of stuff,
you know,

717
00:38:52,391 --> 00:38:55,030
liquid chemicals is a big
part of it and we get all,

718
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:58,300
almost all that 90 plus percent from
oil today and the petrochemical economy,

719
00:38:58,301 --> 00:38:59,410
it's all going to shift to renewables.

720
00:38:59,411 --> 00:39:02,830
And so that sort of manufacturing stuff
like the stuff that goes into plastics,

721
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,860
which is more and more of the
physical world that we're in. Um,

722
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,250
obviously metals will still come from,
you know, no, unfortunately metal sources,

723
00:39:09,251 --> 00:39:10,084
but,
um,

724
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:13,660
I think we'll shift to carbon and other
kinds of materials increasingly for

725
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:16,940
structural stuff. Um, this
is potentially in the,

726
00:39:16,941 --> 00:39:19,900
the nanotech slash carbon economy
of the future that, you know,

727
00:39:19,901 --> 00:39:24,460
building things out of carbon nanotube
like structures and meshes is just a much

728
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,370
lighter materials,
uh,

729
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:31,330
sort of effective and efficient way of
doing things. So we can look to nature.

730
00:39:31,331 --> 00:39:35,920
And how does a spider silk
thread outperform on almost
any other modern material

731
00:39:35,921 --> 00:39:38,770
and like white, there are startups
that are building synthetic silk.

732
00:39:38,771 --> 00:39:42,790
Now with these old nano machines
that reproduce the, what the spinner,

733
00:39:42,791 --> 00:39:45,550
it doesn't a spider so across it,

734
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:48,050
but just coming back to just
this inequality point, uh, in,

735
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:50,270
in the corporate path potentially there.
Um,

736
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:53,740
or it could be like a peace
corps equivalent that says
if you work for x number

737
00:39:53,741 --> 00:39:58,300
of years, you get healthcare in
theory for a longer period of time.

738
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,440
Right?
In,

739
00:39:59,441 --> 00:40:02,080
why couldn't that start to subsume the
way some companies already provide lunch

740
00:40:02,081 --> 00:40:06,640
for free? Why couldn't in a sense, basic
food, shelter, clothing and healthcare,

741
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,790
the provided for free
and the health care part,

742
00:40:09,791 --> 00:40:12,190
by the way right now is a huge part of
the economy. But it shouldn't be right?

743
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:15,810
I think we're also, and this is
something I want to invest in, um,

744
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:19,030
we're going to find a way to make the
information search of health free so we

745
00:40:19,031 --> 00:40:20,860
don't have to pay for the diagnosis.

746
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:24,880
And I can't imagine a future where
knowing what I need to do to make myself

747
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:26,980
healthy, it would be something
I'd pay for it. The actual doing,

748
00:40:26,981 --> 00:40:29,320
if it involves surgery,
maybe the pills,

749
00:40:29,321 --> 00:40:33,610
they should all be in dollar a pound
and the physical thing and that future.

750
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:37,200
I think we'll be incredibly enabling
for changing society to a stable and we

751
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:40,180
don't fear for the health of your
children or their ability to live.

752
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:44,380
Then you could have almost
like a renaissance where
you pursue the things that

753
00:40:44,381 --> 00:40:47,170
are meaningful to you, whether it's
poetry or science or what have you.

754
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:50,050
Meaningful work online.
People do this all the time.

755
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:52,790
We spend a ridiculous amount of our
time on things that aren't paid right,

756
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:53,860
but are meaningful to us.

757
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:56,450
And that I think increasingly is what
the world will look like in the future.

758
00:40:56,451 --> 00:41:00,520
And meaningful work and contributions,
not a job in the traditional sense.

759
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:03,820
If the pills are dollar pound is the,

760
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:08,110
how do you maintain the ability to
develop and innovate those drugs?

761
00:41:08,111 --> 00:41:13,111
Is it just because the computational
power become so inexpensive that you have

762
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:18,070
then, uh, competitors to the
current incumbents who of course,

763
00:41:18,071 --> 00:41:21,660
hi incentivize to protect. Exactly.
It's the long run has because you, you,

764
00:41:21,661 --> 00:41:25,340
you can imagine any,
any current phase or even long term,

765
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:28,150
whether you call it transition phase or
just this is how the new ones come to

766
00:41:28,151 --> 00:41:29,740
market as you have to reward of course,

767
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:33,040
that effort in to the extent that effort
is still as expensive as it is today,

768
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:35,120
you would, you need to recoup it. Right?

769
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,790
And that would be in the hills real
property questions, sort of the,

770
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:39,520
it's almost again, like
the software of it. The,

771
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:41,660
the generic manufacturers know
how to make the drug. It's,

772
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:44,000
but for law around intellectual
property that it costs more.

773
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:46,210
So the physical manufacturing is
still gonna be a dollar found.

774
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:50,000
And now the question is, is it priced
as such? And so in my model of, of this,

775
00:41:50,001 --> 00:41:53,960
you'd start with the generics and um, and
have this massive distribution channel.

776
00:41:53,961 --> 00:41:55,940
Like, if you want to reach
a billion people, you know,

777
00:41:55,970 --> 00:41:57,650
you can sign on to this platform for the,
you know,

778
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:00,470
the poorest of the poor
and reach a billion people,

779
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:03,890
had some sort of reasonable
costs position for a generic.

780
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:07,950
But I think the cost of discovery will
also come down back to the computation

781
00:42:07,951 --> 00:42:11,300
and the one quantum chemistry side so
that it doesn't need to take so long and

782
00:42:11,301 --> 00:42:12,134
be so expensive.

783
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,530
And right now you have an FDA regulatory
system that's a bit archaic in that

784
00:42:15,531 --> 00:42:18,800
regard where they aren't quite set up
yet and they're trying to transition,

785
00:42:18,801 --> 00:42:22,250
but they're slow at this into a world
where you have personalized medicine in a

786
00:42:22,251 --> 00:42:26,000
world where my medicine is different than
yours and therefore the clinical trial

787
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:30,760
concept really changes. Right.
So we've been talking mostly, uh,

788
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:33,950
current,
Rsa Present and future tense.

789
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:38,510
I want to go back to that two and a half
years. Oh, sure. Undergrad. How does,

790
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:43,340
how does such a thing happen?
Well, I mean, how's that
possible? It's interesting.

791
00:42:43,341 --> 00:42:46,940
I took it as a challenge
when I started at college.

792
00:42:46,941 --> 00:42:50,570
I was going to Stanford and I realized
it was expensive and my folks are

793
00:42:50,571 --> 00:42:55,571
immigrants from Estonia and I kind of
found it difficult and we were middle

794
00:42:55,701 --> 00:42:56,990
class people at the time.

795
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:59,460
So I didn't get financial aid and I was
looking at this, I'm like, you know,

796
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:01,160
this costs a lot.
I just felt guilt.

797
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:05,900
So I looked at the various
rules for graduation and it
felt like a simple system

798
00:43:05,901 --> 00:43:08,390
of equations like this plus
that equal to this was like,

799
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:09,890
I actually boil it down to,
oh I see.

800
00:43:09,891 --> 00:43:12,740
They're just trying to get four
years of tuition Nadia, so what,

801
00:43:12,741 --> 00:43:14,300
where can I explore the corner cases?

802
00:43:14,301 --> 00:43:16,700
And so I came in with the
maximum number AP credits.

803
00:43:16,701 --> 00:43:19,670
So it actually goes back to my
high school saint Mark's in Dallas.

804
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:22,520
That incredibly well
prepared me for college.

805
00:43:22,521 --> 00:43:25,100
So I took the maximum number
of AP units that I could.

806
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:29,390
But of course universities limit, not
surprisingly, how much of that applies.

807
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:33,680
I also took a couple of summer classes
that I could transfer in from another

808
00:43:33,681 --> 00:43:36,680
school. They'd have a certain number
you could do. I Max that out one summer.

809
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:39,410
While I was doing summer jobs at hps,
it took a night classes.

810
00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:42,140
But most of all I got learned
a trick from the Grad students.

811
00:43:42,141 --> 00:43:45,410
This is the key answer actually. Um, by
the time you get to be a Grad student,

812
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,320
you realize that you're limited to
something like nine units a quarter.

813
00:43:48,321 --> 00:43:50,990
And that's kind of limiting the, if you
take five minute classes, well shoot,

814
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:52,400
you know,
you're taking class in half.

815
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:56,870
So what they realized is you can sign
up for a class for less units than it's

816
00:43:56,871 --> 00:44:00,500
listed, just not more. So the check
sum on the computer algorithm was not,

817
00:44:00,501 --> 00:44:04,100
did you say it's a five unit class and
it's or say at six and it's the only five.

818
00:44:04,101 --> 00:44:05,960
It's you know,
is it that or or less.

819
00:44:05,961 --> 00:44:09,710
So you can just say it's a even a zero
unit class or one you use and make it

820
00:44:09,711 --> 00:44:12,170
whatever you want. So you aren't
taking more than 20 minutes a quarter.

821
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:16,160
So you meet that algorithm yet you've
got all the prerequisite classes you

822
00:44:16,161 --> 00:44:18,560
needed for the next one. He had to look,
you have to map this out early on, right?

823
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:20,570
You have to start freshman
year to make this work. Oh.

824
00:44:20,571 --> 00:44:24,680
And I had to get a physics teacher to
let me take a class and a teacher sort of

825
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:28,640
against the prerequisites and
look, I really can do this. Let me,

826
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:31,740
let me try to take your class a year
earlier than I should so that I could get

827
00:44:31,741 --> 00:44:32,700
the prereq chain going.

828
00:44:32,701 --> 00:44:34,500
So there's all these simultaneous
equations you have to solve.

829
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:37,080
But the signing up for
more classes with the key,

830
00:44:37,081 --> 00:44:40,140
there was like one winter quarter when I
took the Quillon of eight classes where

831
00:44:40,141 --> 00:44:43,950
you'd normally take a load of four, um,
that made that possible. So when did it,

832
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:44,813
if it did,

833
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:50,030
when did the budgeting stop
being a concern because you
then went on to continue

834
00:44:53,161 --> 00:44:57,480
your schooling, right? It'll
flip completely total mode shift.

835
00:44:57,481 --> 00:45:00,460
When I started my master's program and I
became a research assistant and cause I

836
00:45:00,461 --> 00:45:04,410
paid for school. Uh, so
the moms that HP at HP,

837
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,560
I started a master's in which engineering?
Right?

838
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:09,720
So it's Phil at Stanford and I see that
was a research assistant professor,

839
00:45:09,721 --> 00:45:10,470
Hennessy,
who went,

840
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:13,740
who went on to do amazing things there
and was an entrepreneur himself. Um,

841
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:17,850
at one point. And, uh, and I shifted
gears. I didn't want to leave school.

842
00:45:17,851 --> 00:45:20,190
I mean like going through two and
half years. The problem is like, wow,

843
00:45:20,191 --> 00:45:24,630
I kind of missed out on a lot of
the social life and like living. Um,

844
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:29,250
and so I basically at that point stretched
down and try to stay as long as I

845
00:45:29,251 --> 00:45:32,280
could. Got a balloon payment. It's
Kinda funny how incentives change. Yeah.

846
00:45:32,281 --> 00:45:33,840
Now I want to stay, I
don't want to leave. Right.

847
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:37,290
And I found a way to be in the
freshman dorms as a Grad student,

848
00:45:37,291 --> 00:45:39,600
which is awesome as a
computer coordinator there,

849
00:45:39,601 --> 00:45:42,150
which meant I kept the computers running
and kept the paper in the printers.

850
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:42,690
But man,

851
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:45,630
I could have sort of freshman dorm
life all over again as a Grad student.

852
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:48,290
And that was fun.
Uh,

853
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:53,820
so if we look then at your masters,
and I suppose it would have been,

854
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:54,810
maybe it was simultaneous,

855
00:45:54,811 --> 00:45:59,811
but if or after you could tell us the
NBA since all that came later that came

856
00:46:00,151 --> 00:46:01,740
later.
So the NBA,

857
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:07,040
why did you decide to get an Mba
and if would you do it again?

858
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:09,300
If,
why or why not?

859
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:14,490
A lot of folks who I knew and know or
asking that same question and I think,

860
00:46:14,491 --> 00:46:18,300
uh, it's, I think it's a challenge a
lot of higher ed is facing, which is,

861
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:22,320
is this a vocational thing? Is this mean
one unusual thing about business school,

862
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:25,740
it's the only educational program I know
of where everyone comes in with prior

863
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:29,520
work experience, you know, even law
school and Med school and what have you,

864
00:46:29,521 --> 00:46:31,350
you know, you're just going
straight in from undergrad.

865
00:46:31,351 --> 00:46:33,930
And so it's got a very different
kind of feel to it that way.

866
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:34,890
And then people might ask,

867
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:37,800
especially when there's something
like a.com boom going on in the 90s.

868
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:41,250
Do I want to step out for a couple of
years from the economy and miss maybe that

869
00:46:41,251 --> 00:46:43,620
window,
that opportunity that might be so ripe.

870
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:48,480
So the main reason I went is a
networking really to uh, expand the,

871
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:51,770
uh, the sort of an end to
learn frankly, um, two x,

872
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:54,990
but the networking came first to mind to
meet a bunch of people who've come from

873
00:46:54,991 --> 00:46:58,030
all kinds of different backgrounds
that I could learn from, uh,

874
00:46:58,110 --> 00:47:02,010
not only at school but throughout my life.
And one of the sub points on that is,

875
00:47:02,011 --> 00:47:05,850
for example, pretty basic questions
like, what do I want to do in my life?

876
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:10,860
I had bounced around from engineering to
management consulting prior to business

877
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:13,710
school and thought, well,
from what I know today,

878
00:47:13,711 --> 00:47:16,470
I'd maybe want to go to product marketing.
I thought that's what I wanted to do.

879
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,800
I don't know. I don't know anyone
that's done that. They know. And, well,

880
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:23,310
if I've got a business goal in
winter where I want to look,

881
00:47:23,311 --> 00:47:25,410
there's going to be plenty of students
who've done that in the past and they're

882
00:47:25,411 --> 00:47:27,240
looking to do something new.
And so you get all the,

883
00:47:27,241 --> 00:47:29,230
of all the consultants generally to
consulting, you know, all the, you know,

884
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:31,980
I bankers trying to leave I banking
and learn about something new. Um,

885
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:33,400
what better place.

886
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:36,790
And then especially with your employer
hoping to leave his bang for it. Exactly.

887
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:39,490
That's exactly right. In fact,
that's exactly what happened to me.

888
00:47:39,491 --> 00:47:43,450
I was financed by my former employer,
so I had that sort of safety net.

889
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:45,070
And then when I decided not to go back,

890
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:47,070
I had to pay for all my
tuition in one on one check.

891
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:52,690
That was don't let that one go that
you have a, it's a loan. And I mean,

892
00:47:52,691 --> 00:47:55,840
rightly so. I didn't expect to get a
free ride and not go back. But, um,

893
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:59,260
but it did raise a barrier to leaving. Um,
oh, the other thing is learning. I mean,

894
00:47:59,261 --> 00:48:02,920
I should, it should go. I
mean the business was not
what I went to learn per se.

895
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:06,640
I knew there'd be some classes about
business that I thought would be helpful,

896
00:48:06,641 --> 00:48:09,880
but I'd done so much at Bain that I kind
of had a small business degree already.

897
00:48:09,881 --> 00:48:14,140
And I taken the classes back when I was
an Undergrad and a Grad student prior in

898
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:16,480
accounting and finance. So I'd
already taken a lot of, again,

899
00:48:16,481 --> 00:48:19,550
the core courses I placed out of every
core course at business school too. And,

900
00:48:19,610 --> 00:48:22,690
and went right into the sort
of the electives and the
more interesting classes.

901
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:27,010
But I also knew that it was an opportunity
to take classes in other departments,

902
00:48:27,011 --> 00:48:29,950
you know, to brush up on actually the
molecular stimulation of all things.

903
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:33,330
And one of the classes I took
was on modeling, you know,

904
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:35,200
quantum mechanical
properties of materials.

905
00:48:35,201 --> 00:48:39,760
Like you normally don't get to
take a class like that. Um, and,

906
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:43,840
and that really all played out. So it
gave me, so did it do what I expected?

907
00:48:43,841 --> 00:48:47,710
In a way it did. I didn't know a venture
capital existed when I grew up in Texas.

908
00:48:47,711 --> 00:48:49,750
I'd heard the term,
I never met a venture capitalist.

909
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:53,800
Never knew anything about them. Didn't,
wouldn't know how to reach one. No idea.

910
00:48:53,801 --> 00:48:55,180
Right now man,
I grew up there wasn't internet,

911
00:48:55,181 --> 00:48:56,650
so like they literally would
not know how to reach one.

912
00:48:56,651 --> 00:48:59,410
They're not in the phone book and you
know, there's no way to find them. Um,

913
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:03,300
they really aren't putting up billboards
or advertising in any way. So, um,

914
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:04,720
the entire transition,

915
00:49:04,721 --> 00:49:09,721
the venture occurred because of people
I met there and got a good location for

916
00:49:10,241 --> 00:49:12,760
it too. That's true in the middle of
Silicon Valley. That's true. Yeah.

917
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:14,860
And that was the only school I applied
to by the way. You think about it.

918
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:15,641
Do you want to go visit school?

919
00:49:15,641 --> 00:49:18,220
I did not apply to any other
school because there was
another school that would

920
00:49:18,221 --> 00:49:22,390
have met that goal.
Right, right. So, uh, uh,

921
00:49:22,391 --> 00:49:25,070
and also I learned a lot and the
network back to the network, uh,

922
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:26,650
almost every investment I made,

923
00:49:26,651 --> 00:49:30,160
I think it was almost for the first
year or two out of business goal.

924
00:49:30,190 --> 00:49:32,200
And that was a lot because
it's middle of the.com boom.

925
00:49:32,201 --> 00:49:34,000
For me had some business will connection.

926
00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:36,580
It was either literally entrepreneurs
were from business school or it was sent

927
00:49:36,581 --> 00:49:39,400
to me by a professor from that business
school or like do like for the first

928
00:49:39,401 --> 00:49:43,790
year. That's how I jump started.
Everything I did and I don't know. So

929
00:49:45,350 --> 00:49:48,560
my madness slash method is usually,
uh,

930
00:49:48,890 --> 00:49:52,940
not chronological sewer charge. Uh,
we're going to zoom out a little bit.

931
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:57,470
What mistakes do you see otherwise?

932
00:49:57,471 --> 00:50:02,000
Very smart venture capitalists making?
Are there any patterns?

933
00:50:02,001 --> 00:50:05,690
Are there any particular
types of mistakes? Could be
investors broadly speaking,

934
00:50:05,691 --> 00:50:10,580
but yeah. Oh my God, tons all over
the place. And to be fair, uh,

935
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:13,010
I'll try to drop in and mention
when I made those same mistakes.

936
00:50:13,011 --> 00:50:16,130
So I by no means I'm trying to
judge as if I know better. Um,

937
00:50:16,670 --> 00:50:17,840
but two that jump to mind.

938
00:50:17,841 --> 00:50:22,841
One is way too many seem to be a of
loss avoidance or fearful and I'll come,

939
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:24,740
I'll elaborate that in a moment.
And then,

940
00:50:24,741 --> 00:50:26,770
but the other one that jumps
to mind equally is, um,

941
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:32,180
they think that they've hit upon
the only formula for success. And,

942
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:37,330
yeah, that has many different levels
at which that's worry something.

943
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:40,470
So the first one, um, this
notion that of being fear driven,

944
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:44,570
I've come across so many investors
who will say something like, well,

945
00:50:44,571 --> 00:50:47,600
we have a strategy to try not to try not
to lose any company as if that's like

946
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:50,330
we're in the trenches. You know,
every company will succeed.

947
00:50:50,331 --> 00:50:53,510
And if you've just been at
this game for a few decades,

948
00:50:53,511 --> 00:50:56,510
you'll realize that's just
folly, right? The earlier ego,

949
00:50:56,540 --> 00:50:59,150
the higher your death rate's going to
be a startup, the majority will fail.

950
00:50:59,190 --> 00:51:02,900
Just give them time. And that's sad.
Reality took awhile to sink in for some,

951
00:51:03,110 --> 00:51:05,780
but until it does, you're going to
be very timid in your investing.

952
00:51:05,781 --> 00:51:10,781
So most investors I see just let all of
the biggest home runs passed them by,

953
00:51:11,770 --> 00:51:15,200
uh, almost every term sheet I've written
to a company that's turned out to be a

954
00:51:15,201 --> 00:51:18,400
spectacular home run. I had no
competition at the time of the series.

955
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:20,840
It was kidding. Like nobody else
would invest in the company.

956
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:24,260
What would the reasons for not
investing? Oh yeah, it's crazy. Uh,

957
00:51:24,261 --> 00:51:27,400
it's way too early. It's a science
project, no traction home. Yeah,

958
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:30,110
there's no product. I mean, so, um, so
first off, I almost everything I'm doing,

959
00:51:30,111 --> 00:51:33,560
there's no product, no customers
yet. It's an idea. It's in prototype,

960
00:51:33,561 --> 00:51:37,640
stage of development or there's no even
prototype yet or they just don't agree

961
00:51:37,641 --> 00:51:41,510
the world is going to change in this
way. So, uh, and in often cases,

962
00:51:41,511 --> 00:51:43,160
conventional wisdom would
support their point of view.

963
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:46,170
Like let's not invest in any automotive
company because every investment,

964
00:51:46,171 --> 00:51:50,030
since Henry Ford has filled like 100%
of them that are just roadkill scattered

965
00:51:50,031 --> 00:51:53,360
on the highway and there's been,
but it's, by the way, many,

966
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:57,790
many startups funded well over $10
million, you know, so it was like back,

967
00:51:57,870 --> 00:52:00,920
you know, decades ago. That's a lot
of money. And the automotive sector,

968
00:52:00,921 --> 00:52:05,330
all of which have failed, um, many and
batteries, many and solar, I mean just,

969
00:52:05,331 --> 00:52:08,720
just scores. I mean maybe hundreds of
companies that failed. So when you've,

970
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:12,140
let's say lost four times in a row,
you just give up on the category.

971
00:52:12,141 --> 00:52:14,350
So sometimes it's the more
experience grizzled investors like,

972
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:15,081
well that whole sector,

973
00:52:15,081 --> 00:52:17,510
I'm just going to like steer clear of
it because I'm too many scar tissues

974
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:21,500
neither. Um, but that's not
really the thing I'm talking
to think about, you know,

975
00:52:21,501 --> 00:52:24,800
new entrance to the venture business
people who you would think would take a

976
00:52:24,801 --> 00:52:28,670
strategy of differentiating myself from
my peers and a bait like having a basic

977
00:52:28,671 --> 00:52:30,440
strategy.
Let's say they say,

978
00:52:30,441 --> 00:52:33,440
why would an entrepreneur want to work
with me versus all the other firms?

979
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:36,740
And if it's like, well, I'm investing
in the hot sector, pick whatever it is,

980
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:39,290
dishwasher, you know, consumer
internet or social this or you know,

981
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:42,770
blockchain that it's like, well
it's the hot thing. Well, yeah,

982
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:45,310
but this is also a hundred other people
who had the exact same idea you just did.

983
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:49,210
It's the hot things. Like
why are you different? And
there's like no answer. Right?

984
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:54,350
So, um, this, this lack of
strategic thinking about a,
and also lack of thinking of,

985
00:52:54,370 --> 00:52:57,790
of, of, of a longterm
strategy. Like, okay, whatever
you're doing today was that,

986
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,150
is that going to work 10 years from now?

987
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:02,870
Whatever that strategy is and like I don't
hear strategy from anyone. Like okay,

988
00:53:02,871 --> 00:53:05,300
here's how I'm going to stand out
over a sustained period of time.

989
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:07,610
Here's how I will, um, you know, either,

990
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,310
and it can be simple things like
I'll have a niche, I'll only do x, Y,

991
00:53:10,311 --> 00:53:13,220
Z and there'll be known for
my niche or my specialty.

992
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:15,920
What worked for you in the early days
when you're just getting started?

993
00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:20,240
It was um,
well first it was a stroke of great luck,

994
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:22,970
which is the.com boom as we now call it,
you know,

995
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:27,270
was just starting to happen and was
ready for that and open minded enough.

996
00:53:27,271 --> 00:53:29,280
So I didn't have the scar tissue,
which is by the way,

997
00:53:29,281 --> 00:53:31,890
scar tissue for traditional investors
was if you invest in anything,

998
00:53:31,891 --> 00:53:36,270
it was like entertainment or media or
shrink wrap software as they called it,

999
00:53:36,271 --> 00:53:38,100
which is low price software for consumers.

1000
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:40,200
That would be the
consumer software segment.

1001
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:43,080
But it was just a horrible place
and games hits driven business.

1002
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:48,470
It still is a horrible segment is to
do non Internet consumer price points

1003
00:53:49,591 --> 00:53:51,630
stuff.
I just said that zone.

1004
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:54,540
So they thought the Internet was that
they didn't realize it's an entirely

1005
00:53:54,541 --> 00:53:57,360
different business model. The whole
what we now know around cloud computing,

1006
00:53:57,361 --> 00:53:59,870
around subscription services, around
viral marketing, its potential.

1007
00:53:59,890 --> 00:54:02,910
None of this was known at the beginning.
And if you put it into a prior bucket,

1008
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:04,200
it would be all those are bad sectors.

1009
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:08,100
So unbelievably one of the
biggest investment opportunities
probably the venture

1010
00:54:08,101 --> 00:54:10,680
industry has ever seen was a largely
avoided by most venture capital firms.

1011
00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:14,910
And when I started in 1995 we did
about a third of all internet investing

1012
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:18,720
industry wide. Wow. Like
the entire venture industry.

1013
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:21,750
And that quickly changed in
[inaudible] 86 87 and excuse me,

1014
00:54:21,751 --> 00:54:24,000
96 [inaudible] 97 and when
Netscape at its IPO, boom,

1015
00:54:24,001 --> 00:54:26,700
everything changed because now
there was know example of a winter,

1016
00:54:27,450 --> 00:54:29,660
this pattern will come again and
space investing in everything.

1017
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:31,740
Like as soon as you have a single winner,

1018
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:35,190
then the sheep phenomenon in the
herd mentality kicks in, right?

1019
00:54:35,191 --> 00:54:38,940
So you have scores of people and then
investing in the sector after he's had his

1020
00:54:38,941 --> 00:54:41,430
first one. So to your question, um,

1021
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:44,880
being under the tutelage
of Tim draper to say, Hey,

1022
00:54:44,910 --> 00:54:46,320
actually let's try to think big.

1023
00:54:46,321 --> 00:54:50,230
I mean I credit him for being my
mentor into the industry to say not,

1024
00:54:50,310 --> 00:54:53,130
let's think about it the way bankers do.
Let's not be fearful.

1025
00:54:53,131 --> 00:54:57,420
Let's ask the entrepreneur how they're
underestimating the market size to think

1026
00:54:57,421 --> 00:54:59,340
how much bigger might this opportunity be.

1027
00:54:59,341 --> 00:55:02,820
Then even the people pitching it or
imagining that's a thought experiment I

1028
00:55:02,821 --> 00:55:05,840
often like to go through and there'll
be times when the occasional,

1029
00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:09,210
not often where I'll be like, wow, you
are so underselling your opportunity.

1030
00:55:09,211 --> 00:55:09,780
Cause normally I,

1031
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:13,260
I'm just trying to sell to the maximum
extent possible to predict the largest

1032
00:55:13,261 --> 00:55:16,470
possible addressable market to think,
well phase one of my business, I do this.

1033
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:18,360
Then phase two I take over
the world in some way, right?

1034
00:55:18,361 --> 00:55:22,380
And then to actually try to push them
further and then want to invest in them,

1035
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:22,800
you know,

1036
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:26,760
is an interesting adjunct because then
they know you're on the same page. So I,

1037
00:55:27,050 --> 00:55:31,410
so I credit Tim draper, I could at the
Internet. And then most importantly, um,

1038
00:55:31,950 --> 00:55:34,830
is there's a,
there was a simple rule.

1039
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:37,260
I started implementing it and I
don't remember when it started.

1040
00:55:37,261 --> 00:55:41,130
It just seemed like the natural thing
to do, um, around early stage investing.

1041
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:45,270
So when I thought about this, I was
like, okay, most things fail. If they,

1042
00:55:45,271 --> 00:55:47,670
when they've got to be huge, okay,
check. They should change the world.

1043
00:55:47,671 --> 00:55:49,890
They should be disruptive. You know,
those are words people use. Well,

1044
00:55:49,891 --> 00:55:53,400
how would I know if something really is
big and disruptive? Like, Oh, everyone,

1045
00:55:53,401 --> 00:55:54,750
everyone entrepreneur claims it,
right?

1046
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:58,260
Like he'd be doing a payment processing
thing for backend, whatever, you know,

1047
00:55:58,261 --> 00:56:00,780
payroll systems. Like we're going to
change the world of payroll. Right. Okay.

1048
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:04,430
What really is going to make
an enormous opportunity is,

1049
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:07,980
it seemed to me that a, they're
describing an enormous market, but B,

1050
00:56:07,981 --> 00:56:10,320
here's the killer.
No one else has done it before.

1051
00:56:10,830 --> 00:56:14,250
Like instill the simple rule I've used
throughout my entire career investing is

1052
00:56:14,251 --> 00:56:16,770
I wanna invest in things that are
unlike anything I've seen before.

1053
00:56:17,190 --> 00:56:20,490
And there's all kinds of correlates to
come out of that. The first is, yeah,

1054
00:56:20,491 --> 00:56:23,410
you're investing in some unusual things
like d wave, you know, back in 2002,

1055
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:26,410
there were no other quantum computer
startups, zero on the planet earth.

1056
00:56:26,411 --> 00:56:28,570
There was not a single company
claiming to build a quantum computer,

1057
00:56:28,690 --> 00:56:31,720
big or small actually for about
five years afterwards as well.

1058
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:34,270
So that one is like the most extreme
like well maybe for good reasons.

1059
00:56:34,270 --> 00:56:36,970
No one was doing it back
then when hotmail first came.

1060
00:56:36,971 --> 00:56:39,510
There's nothing like it that we'd
seen when I first invested in Skype.

1061
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:41,560
There was anything quite
like that. The, the,

1062
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:45,610
the way they did peer to peer voiceover
Ip. Um, as similarly with Tesla,

1063
00:56:45,611 --> 00:56:46,301
an electric vehicles.

1064
00:56:46,301 --> 00:56:49,870
And I can get it to why that one maybe
is the most corner case of we'll wait.

1065
00:56:49,871 --> 00:56:52,060
There are a lot of electric car startups.
Why is that one specialty?

1066
00:56:52,070 --> 00:56:54,280
And we can talk about it, but
certainly space x, you know,

1067
00:56:54,330 --> 00:56:58,330
who would qualify as well as unique
ideas at the time in the startup domain.

1068
00:56:59,140 --> 00:56:59,973
And,

1069
00:57:00,310 --> 00:57:04,360
but the benefit for my career was it has
me perpetually searching for the next

1070
00:57:04,361 --> 00:57:05,200
great technology wave.

1071
00:57:05,201 --> 00:57:09,310
So just when the.com boom was
getting to it's fevered pitch,

1072
00:57:09,550 --> 00:57:11,340
I wasn't smart enough.
I know that this is a kid.

1073
00:57:11,350 --> 00:57:13,030
I wasn't not smart enough
to predict a crash.

1074
00:57:13,350 --> 00:57:16,930
I know that it wasn't
cause I was contributing in
writings and other things at

1075
00:57:16,931 --> 00:57:19,780
that time saying well it's a boom is just
starting, it's going to go up, up, up, up.

1076
00:57:19,781 --> 00:57:22,450
Right. I believe that because
I just want to do that.

1077
00:57:22,451 --> 00:57:25,280
It's going to keep going and then we
wouldn't have like a correction. Um,

1078
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:27,850
but on the other hand,
I was not finding anything unique.

1079
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:30,850
I sought for business plans for
selling pantyhose on the web.

1080
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:34,270
Like all we're going to do cause l.com
that venture back like, like three others.

1081
00:57:34,271 --> 00:57:38,290
Like really like for business plans to
sell pantyhose or just balls.com and like,

1082
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:41,410
Oh God, what is just balls
do? Oh yeah, just balls.

1083
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:45,630
Venture backed just sells false. The name
was awesome. We got just false. Come.

1084
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:48,580
What do we sell balls? You want to bat?
No. You want a glove? No, we got balls,

1085
00:57:48,910 --> 00:57:52,450
balls and all kinds of small balls.
Big Balls, golf balls, tennis balls.

1086
00:57:52,451 --> 00:57:54,940
Wait a second, where were you? A
founder? No. Okay. Just making sure.

1087
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:56,440
But this shows you how
absurd it got to say.

1088
00:57:56,470 --> 00:57:58,840
Take the economy and like the
Internet changes everything.

1089
00:57:58,841 --> 00:58:02,110
We're going to like divide up the economy
in weird ways that hasn't been divided

1090
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:03,340
up before and make that a business.

1091
00:58:03,341 --> 00:58:06,700
Like that's when I knew this is crazy and
I started investing in nanotechnology.

1092
00:58:07,110 --> 00:58:09,490
I total left field shift.
Um,

1093
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,620
and there's a reason I picked
that particular sector.

1094
00:58:11,621 --> 00:58:15,190
But the important point is I didn't
keep investing in the Internet companies

1095
00:58:15,191 --> 00:58:18,640
long past their prime. Not because I was
smart on when the correction would come,

1096
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,110
but because they weren't unique anymore.

1097
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:24,070
There's like every viral marketing idea
that I at the time that I could find had

1098
00:58:24,071 --> 00:58:27,690
come now to my, so I avoided
a lot of pain. We love,

1099
00:58:27,691 --> 00:58:31,000
we like if you add up every internet,
remember we did so many of them.

1100
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:34,120
If you had every internet company
we invested in that lost money,

1101
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:36,820
add them all up.
It was less than single deals,

1102
00:58:36,821 --> 00:58:39,850
lost from other firms like [inaudible]
dot com lost more money than everything

1103
00:58:39,851 --> 00:58:43,870
we've ever done combined because
we didn't load up the boat,

1104
00:58:43,871 --> 00:58:46,360
sort of drink our own koolaid too
deep in any one of them. And we were,

1105
00:58:46,390 --> 00:58:49,160
every one of them was unique so
there wasn't like this sector risk.

1106
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:50,750
So you get diversification for frequent,

1107
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:53,890
I definition your diversified portfolio
and it had any movement and has been

1108
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:56,920
throughout my career always on
lookout to learn something new,

1109
00:58:56,921 --> 00:58:58,630
knowing that I'm going to
have to hop to new sector,

1110
00:58:58,631 --> 00:59:01,900
not saying going to spend my whole life
as a semi conductor investor or as a

1111
00:59:01,901 --> 00:59:05,230
consumer software investor because
that is so limiting. Yeah. Right.

1112
00:59:05,231 --> 00:59:06,640
That might have a good 10 year run,

1113
00:59:07,150 --> 00:59:10,840
but if you're not continually learning
something new at the edge is pivoting

1114
00:59:10,841 --> 00:59:13,000
from the edges of what you already know,
just something slightly different.

1115
00:59:13,390 --> 00:59:14,260
You're going to be constantly,

1116
00:59:16,270 --> 00:59:20,430
why did you choose now the technology
that was a bit of a mistake, but um,

1117
00:59:20,470 --> 00:59:23,630
it was a mistake in retrospect.
Um,

1118
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:28,310
but it's the only thing I felt I
differentially knew better than others.

1119
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:30,480
It was hearkening back to which,
which,

1120
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:33,610
which fortunately it wasn't that many
years prior that I had been studying some

1121
00:59:33,650 --> 00:59:37,700
really hard technologies like molecular
modeling and you know, chip design.

1122
00:59:37,701 --> 00:59:39,560
It did some chip design
it at Hewlett Packard.

1123
00:59:39,770 --> 00:59:43,550
So I had enough as I looked at the venture
landscape differential knowledge air

1124
00:59:43,551 --> 00:59:43,881
to say,
well,

1125
00:59:43,881 --> 00:59:47,450
there's something I could Harken back
to that's not the internet because the

1126
00:59:47,451 --> 00:59:49,040
Internet anyone could do at this point.
Right.

1127
00:59:49,070 --> 00:59:51,520
And the angel investors to flooding
in like, you know, every banker,

1128
00:59:51,530 --> 00:59:54,890
consultants flooding is like the
landscape littered with capital and people

1129
00:59:54,891 --> 00:59:58,820
investing in that sector.
Well, there's nothing, we're
not in nanotech. I had been,

1130
00:59:59,000 --> 00:59:59,301
uh,

1131
00:59:59,301 --> 01:00:02,270
exploring at the foresight institute a
number of other sort of think tank like

1132
01:00:02,271 --> 01:00:06,080
conferences that the radical potential
has had to revolutionize a bunch of

1133
01:00:06,081 --> 01:00:06,410
things.

1134
01:00:06,410 --> 01:00:10,790
And the one part that I think was
indicative of what's to come later in my

1135
01:00:10,791 --> 01:00:15,380
career, it was not really an end in
any way an industry. It isn't a sector,

1136
01:00:15,381 --> 01:00:16,580
it doesn't describe a company.

1137
01:00:16,581 --> 01:00:19,850
There's no such thing as a nanotech
company unless you're building tools to

1138
01:00:19,851 --> 01:00:23,910
service that industry. You know in a weird
way, manufacturing equipment maybe now,

1139
01:00:23,911 --> 01:00:25,160
but not any attractive sectors.

1140
01:00:25,370 --> 01:00:30,370
It more was a set of science
and technology capabilities
that would strap across

1141
01:00:30,381 --> 01:00:31,101
many industries,

1142
01:00:31,101 --> 01:00:36,050
so even today there'll be companies
that will meet with and things that were

1143
01:00:36,051 --> 01:00:40,130
unique in that from that era will play
out like well the value of simulation on

1144
01:00:40,131 --> 01:00:42,790
any molecular system. Like, well
how, how good is your simulation?

1145
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:43,760
I need physical thing.

1146
01:00:43,761 --> 01:00:48,260
You're building in general these questions
or process questions like like how do

1147
01:00:48,261 --> 01:00:51,320
you do innovation? How do you do
entrepreneurship? That carries through,

1148
01:00:51,321 --> 01:00:54,680
but that platform technology, which,
let me just tell you what I'm,

1149
01:00:54,681 --> 01:00:57,890
what I mean by this. Nano tech was
like a platform applied to men or ears,

1150
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,480
new ways of doing material
science if you will.

1151
01:01:00,090 --> 01:01:02,330
Then there's this whole
field of synthetic biology,

1152
01:01:02,331 --> 01:01:04,700
like if you can manipulate DNA
with CRISPR or other technologies,

1153
01:01:04,701 --> 01:01:08,000
what are all the things you could do
with that capability and it's very broad.

1154
01:01:08,001 --> 01:01:12,530
It's not just health and food and then
more recently deep learning neural

1155
01:01:12,531 --> 01:01:15,920
networks,
what we might describe as narrow AI.

1156
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:19,310
That whole field is widely applicable.

1157
01:01:19,311 --> 01:01:23,420
I think every company will
use it eventually. So again,
we can come to that later.

1158
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:27,080
But that's like a platform that's not
they other shirt today there was some

1159
01:01:27,081 --> 01:01:28,160
quote machine learning companies,

1160
01:01:28,161 --> 01:01:29,840
all they do is stuff
related to machine learning.

1161
01:01:29,841 --> 01:01:33,560
But much more interesting is all of the
industries that will be changed by the

1162
01:01:33,561 --> 01:01:37,340
use of machine learning, the
vertical industries. Um, and so

1163
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:42,160
yeah, to put it, to put a cap on it and
nanotech you know, if you look, think,

1164
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:44,810
look back at it today,
well no there isn't any now tech industry,

1165
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:47,910
it'd be like saying, well
where's the thermodynamics
industry? Well Shit, you know,

1166
01:01:47,911 --> 01:01:51,530
version one right bit the sort of is like
thermodynamics as a concept. You know,

1167
01:01:51,531 --> 01:01:55,220
there was a time when actually companies
named themselves thermo electron and

1168
01:01:55,310 --> 01:01:56,143
you know,

1169
01:01:56,530 --> 01:02:00,290
through medics there were all these ones
that it's just now subsumed into the

1170
01:02:00,291 --> 01:02:03,470
fabric of science and engineering. So
as a geek, I've always been fascinated.

1171
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:05,810
Are there see changes in basically
how we do science and engineering?

1172
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:07,100
Maybe that's the simplest
way of saying it.

1173
01:02:07,490 --> 01:02:11,120
And I think today deep learning is
the best example that a fundamentally

1174
01:02:11,121 --> 01:02:14,870
different way of doing engineering.
So that one more time. The loss of,

1175
01:02:14,970 --> 01:02:17,000
of fundamental.
So I think deep learning,

1176
01:02:17,001 --> 01:02:21,050
or let me just call it machine learning
cause there's a bunch of sub branches.

1177
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:25,710
This is everything from generative design
in, in, in, in sort of the autodesk cad,

1178
01:02:25,711 --> 01:02:30,090
Cam Sands. It's, you know, it's,
it's studying seller Tom. By the way.

1179
01:02:30,091 --> 01:02:32,670
Steve Wolff from does its genetic
proteins sell automata. Ah,

1180
01:02:32,671 --> 01:02:35,520
these are simple little,
a simple little,

1181
01:02:35,521 --> 01:02:39,840
a mathematical construct that just says
if you're going to draw, oh my God,

1182
01:02:39,841 --> 01:02:41,740
you're probably to edit this out
of the final thing cause it's the,

1183
01:02:41,780 --> 01:02:44,490
it may not relate to anything
other than it created this book,

1184
01:02:44,491 --> 01:02:47,300
a new kind of science and it really a
series of epiphany's for Wolfrem and

1185
01:02:47,301 --> 01:02:47,790
others that,

1186
01:02:47,790 --> 01:02:51,080
that the world is really interesting
when you look at iterative algorithms and

1187
01:02:51,081 --> 01:02:52,200
applied millions and billions at times.

1188
01:02:52,290 --> 01:02:57,290
So seller trauma is just imagine you
start with a random dot or two and then x

1189
01:02:57,430 --> 01:03:00,540
line automaton. But with,
yeah, it's sort of unveil.

1190
01:03:00,541 --> 01:03:02,940
So you have this little simple rule,
almost like a turning machine that says,

1191
01:03:02,941 --> 01:03:05,940
I'm just going to go left to right
and look at the dots above me.

1192
01:03:05,941 --> 01:03:08,400
And if the dot above me,
I'll look at the three dots about me,

1193
01:03:08,401 --> 01:03:11,640
one directly above me left and to the
right and based on all possibilities of

1194
01:03:11,641 --> 01:03:15,840
those three dots, which is, you know, to
the third power, um, uh, possibilities.

1195
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:18,270
I'll have either a daughter,
not a.here.

1196
01:03:18,330 --> 01:03:21,420
And so you would think that such
a simple rule that just says,

1197
01:03:21,421 --> 01:03:22,830
look at the three dots into,

1198
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:27,690
and there's literally only
16 possible things that I'm
going to, you know, uh, uh,

1199
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:31,990
conditions that I could be seeing up
there. Um, I'll have some other, you know,

1200
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:35,820
I'll do some something.
In most cases it's very boring.

1201
01:03:35,821 --> 01:03:39,450
It's just like the whole thing is
black or it's got like a nice pattern

1202
01:03:39,490 --> 01:03:42,150
triangles. But in a few
cases, like real 31,

1203
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:45,930
it unpacks into this incredible
complexity that is not repeating.

1204
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:50,070
And there's no way to jump to, let's
say the fourth, the fifth or the 50th,

1205
01:03:50,071 --> 01:03:54,060
their hundredth Le Layer of this
unfolding. You have to run the experiment.

1206
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:57,720
And the reason I find
this so philosophically
interesting is this is the same

1207
01:03:57,721 --> 01:04:00,720
thing in evolution. It's the same thing
in neural networks. It's the same thing.

1208
01:04:00,721 --> 01:04:04,260
And all these new engineering modalities
where you can't mathematically get a

1209
01:04:04,261 --> 01:04:07,360
shortcut to the answer, you actually have
to just run this little algorithm over.

1210
01:04:07,361 --> 01:04:11,390
No, no, no her again. So you can't, like
for example, you can't reverse evolve.

1211
01:04:11,410 --> 01:04:16,050
You can't figure out where did we come
from in any direct way. It's sort of lost.

1212
01:04:16,051 --> 01:04:18,330
You can run the tape forward,
but you can't run it backwards.

1213
01:04:18,331 --> 01:04:20,670
You can't do mathematical
shortcut across it.

1214
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:24,180
And so an example of why this is as
a thought experiment is important is

1215
01:04:24,450 --> 01:04:25,990
whenever you're developing these
neural networks, when you're,

1216
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,790
whenever you're training,
let's say these little ais,

1217
01:04:27,830 --> 01:04:29,640
and I think this is the
path to AI in general.

1218
01:04:29,730 --> 01:04:31,500
So it's important that
this is how it works.

1219
01:04:32,730 --> 01:04:34,410
You can't understand
the thing you've made,

1220
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:38,070
nor can you predict as you train the
further and further what you're going to

1221
01:04:38,071 --> 01:04:41,490
get. There's a bit of discovery
emergence, if you will.

1222
01:04:41,491 --> 01:04:44,370
It's kind of like raising a teenager or
parenting more than it is programming

1223
01:04:44,570 --> 01:04:46,860
that you can learn about
the process of creation.

1224
01:04:46,861 --> 01:04:48,270
Like I know how to make a teenager,

1225
01:04:48,630 --> 01:04:50,760
but I can't tell you exactly
how it all works. Right.

1226
01:04:50,761 --> 01:04:53,440
And I certainly can't go in there after
I'm done and tweak a few neurons to make

1227
01:04:53,441 --> 01:04:55,500
him smarter or French speaking
or whatever. It's like, no,

1228
01:04:55,501 --> 01:04:59,310
that's a really weird artifact
that works really powerfully.

1229
01:04:59,580 --> 01:05:04,410
But it's not purposeful design.
It doesn't do what I tell it to do.

1230
01:05:04,411 --> 01:05:08,430
Exactly. It can learn to do what
I trained it to do. But you know,

1231
01:05:08,431 --> 01:05:12,110
with some edge cases it's a little out
of control and that's what I think the

1232
01:05:12,111 --> 01:05:13,980
AI's of the future will look like.
So I,

1233
01:05:14,490 --> 01:05:17,100
I can come back to it if you want to talk
about AI and deep learning, but I just,

1234
01:05:17,140 --> 01:05:21,370
you asked about seller Tamida
and the process learning.

1235
01:05:21,910 --> 01:05:24,010
The key with this question started
with his engineering, right? Yep.

1236
01:05:24,050 --> 01:05:24,760
So they wanted,

1237
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:27,670
that I wanted to say is I think deep
learning slash machine intelligence is the

1238
01:05:27,671 --> 01:05:31,540
biggest advance in how
we can do engineering.

1239
01:05:32,370 --> 01:05:35,410
Specifically engineering since
the scientific method itself.

1240
01:05:35,620 --> 01:05:37,290
So can you weigh that gland engineering,

1241
01:05:37,291 --> 01:05:39,670
I've been random like I think
astrologists jewel, I think this is true.

1242
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:40,870
And then you have the scientific method.

1243
01:05:40,871 --> 01:05:42,850
You leased a method of
compounding knowledge over time.

1244
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:44,970
This is a different way of innocence,

1245
01:05:45,010 --> 01:05:47,470
growing solutions to problems
instead of purposely designing them.

1246
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:49,570
But you can build things that
exceed human understanding.

1247
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:51,940
We're doing this all over the
place in molecular engineering,

1248
01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:55,000
in software design and
in a variety of fields.

1249
01:05:55,030 --> 01:05:58,660
We have sort of reached the limit
in many cases of what a human,

1250
01:05:58,661 --> 01:06:02,980
any human or even group of humans can
put their heads together and design and

1251
01:06:02,981 --> 01:06:06,160
now we can push way past that and build
things beyond our own understanding,

1252
01:06:06,690 --> 01:06:10,630
which is pretty powerful. Yeah.
Could you define, uh, just revisit,

1253
01:06:10,631 --> 01:06:11,920
you might have already done it indirectly,

1254
01:06:11,950 --> 01:06:15,430
but the deep learning and neural networks.
Yeah,

1255
01:06:15,490 --> 01:06:18,400
I guess I have sort of an
approximate equal sign here.

1256
01:06:18,401 --> 01:06:20,920
I'm not sure if like they're
synonymous in the 80s.

1257
01:06:20,921 --> 01:06:23,650
They call it neural
networks and deep learning.

1258
01:06:23,650 --> 01:06:25,570
There is a reason the word deep Cayman.

1259
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:28,540
Well first you want a new name when
something kind of came and went and let's

1260
01:06:28,541 --> 01:06:29,241
pass a,
you know,

1261
01:06:29,241 --> 01:06:32,740
a couple of decades ago because I studied
neural networks second eighties. Um,

1262
01:06:33,070 --> 01:06:34,060
you know,
I think of it a new moniker,

1263
01:06:34,061 --> 01:06:36,180
but there is a reason deepen
the sense of more layer.

1264
01:06:36,181 --> 01:06:37,690
So what do they have in common?

1265
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:41,530
And in fact in general that works I
think is could be a more generic term for

1266
01:06:41,531 --> 01:06:43,000
all this.
It's inspired by the brain.

1267
01:06:43,450 --> 01:06:47,650
It's a way of simulating
a brain like subsets.

1268
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:48,491
So not the whole brain.

1269
01:06:48,491 --> 01:06:50,850
But imagine if you were to take a
little tiny chunk of your brain,

1270
01:06:50,870 --> 01:06:53,290
the cortical column or some area and
say, well, what's really going on? Well,

1271
01:06:53,291 --> 01:06:56,980
you have cells that connect to
a bunch of others in our brain.

1272
01:06:56,981 --> 01:07:01,090
It's usually a fan out of a thousand or
so to 10,000 connections from each one.

1273
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:02,140
So huge fan out.

1274
01:07:02,230 --> 01:07:05,740
Each cell connects a whole bunch of
others and when one fires it sort of goes

1275
01:07:05,741 --> 01:07:08,380
down and write and then little synapse
fires and it triggers another one.

1276
01:07:08,381 --> 01:07:11,420
We all have some vague sense of, okay,
neurons are in our brain and they,

1277
01:07:11,421 --> 01:07:13,870
and they sort of wired together
and they fire together.

1278
01:07:15,010 --> 01:07:17,560
So now if you want to simulate one
of those in a very simplistic way,

1279
01:07:17,561 --> 01:07:20,440
in a way that you like imagined the
programmers back in the eighties and I had

1280
01:07:20,441 --> 01:07:22,000
pretty not very powerful computers,

1281
01:07:22,450 --> 01:07:24,280
well how could you make
a computer like brain?

1282
01:07:24,281 --> 01:07:25,890
Well we don't need all that complexity.

1283
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:29,170
Maybe we don't need all the details
of ion channels in synapses and,

1284
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:32,590
and all the neurotransmitter chemicals
that are artifacts of our biology.

1285
01:07:32,591 --> 01:07:34,450
What really is the essence
of what's going on here?

1286
01:07:34,451 --> 01:07:37,270
And the essence is something activates it,
fires,

1287
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:41,860
it's connected in a network to some
others. And if there's enough, you know,

1288
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:44,200
inputs that are firing
and beyond a threshold,

1289
01:07:44,410 --> 01:07:47,710
then then downstream neuronal fire too.
So the simple idea is if I,

1290
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:51,550
to recap is neurons fire.
They're wired to other ones.

1291
01:07:51,580 --> 01:07:54,370
You sum up all your inputs,
everything that's connected on the input.

1292
01:07:54,371 --> 01:07:58,390
There's like thousands of inputs. And if
it crosses some threshold, then you fire.

1293
01:07:58,870 --> 01:08:02,020
That's it. And then, then you
just lay on tons of these.

1294
01:08:02,021 --> 01:08:04,990
And so the deep learning is having more
and more of these layers instead of just

1295
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:09,730
like one or two or three layers having
scores of these layers and a variety of

1296
01:08:09,731 --> 01:08:11,050
other algorithmic advances.

1297
01:08:11,051 --> 01:08:14,740
But really the biggest breakthrough is
has been that we have a lot of data today

1298
01:08:14,741 --> 01:08:18,170
that we have back in the
80s from the Internet, from
Mechanical Turk, you name it,

1299
01:08:18,290 --> 01:08:20,810
all kinds of data sets to train on.
Um,

1300
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:23,900
like if you want to pictures of cats with
the label, that's a cat. That's a dog.

1301
01:08:23,901 --> 01:08:25,680
I mean that's obviously they would
take it for granted. Like, oh,

1302
01:08:25,681 --> 01:08:27,110
of course you want a million of those.
You want to billion,

1303
01:08:27,111 --> 01:08:29,900
how many pictures of cast? One
right in the eighties. Good luck.

1304
01:08:29,930 --> 01:08:32,510
You could spend your whole career trying
to get a good data set to train these

1305
01:08:32,511 --> 01:08:34,670
neural networks with them. Plus we didn't
have digital cameras. I mean it's like,

1306
01:08:34,671 --> 01:08:36,830
it's crazy if you think how little
data we had an eighties. Okay,

1307
01:08:36,860 --> 01:08:40,700
so data is the first. The
other is, um, gps from nvidia.

1308
01:08:41,180 --> 01:08:43,400
They started about 10 years ago.

1309
01:08:43,401 --> 01:08:47,870
It wasn't a side project in scientific
computing realizing abuse, right?

1310
01:08:48,220 --> 01:08:49,190
So any gamer would be like,

1311
01:08:49,191 --> 01:08:53,120
I want the latest to play my video
games to do all these polygon renderings

1312
01:08:53,270 --> 01:08:55,460
offloaded from your main computing chip,

1313
01:08:55,490 --> 01:08:58,760
the Intel chip usually off on the
side where it used to be a peripheral

1314
01:08:58,850 --> 01:09:01,820
processor, a coprocessor,
an afterthought if you will,

1315
01:09:01,821 --> 01:09:05,060
that only gamers cared about if
you were a business computing user,

1316
01:09:05,061 --> 01:09:08,090
you in the old days in the 90s you
didn't care about your Gpu, right?

1317
01:09:08,090 --> 01:09:10,490
And he only cared about was your CPU
the thing that computes your excel

1318
01:09:10,491 --> 01:09:11,840
spreadsheet or whatever your database.

1319
01:09:11,841 --> 01:09:15,800
But the GPU people were like pushing a
whole different kinds of computational

1320
01:09:15,830 --> 01:09:20,030
math forward, which was on a lot
of math. Like a lot of polygons.

1321
01:09:20,031 --> 01:09:23,120
The more polygons, the more
you know, sort of you know,

1322
01:09:23,150 --> 01:09:24,440
resolution you have in your game.

1323
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:27,380
And so when a very exciting way
with a different objective function,

1324
01:09:27,381 --> 01:09:31,460
not do a program that a human
wrote faster and faster,

1325
01:09:31,490 --> 01:09:35,810
but take the same damn simple math of
basically it turned out to be made what's

1326
01:09:35,811 --> 01:09:36,950
called Matrix multiply.
And add,

1327
01:09:38,010 --> 01:09:40,880
multiply a whole bunch of numbers together
and add them up, multiply, add them up.

1328
01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:43,730
It's like that core multiple
sort of mathematical operation.

1329
01:09:44,090 --> 01:09:46,370
The more you could do,
the better your graphics were.

1330
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:49,730
And so they had an economic incentive
to really push the envelope where if you

1331
01:09:49,731 --> 01:09:53,300
asked, let's say in the
eighties or nineties, what else
could that be used for it?

1332
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:56,060
The answer was, well, nothing, right?
That, that just does graphics, cds,

1333
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:59,360
I totally optimized for
rendering graphics. Right?

1334
01:10:00,350 --> 01:10:02,480
But somewhere along the way people
realized, well, wait a second,

1335
01:10:02,510 --> 01:10:05,720
there's other areas in the scientific
community worldwide. By this I mean,

1336
01:10:05,990 --> 01:10:08,970
let's say modeling the weather,
you know, modeling how, you know,

1337
01:10:08,990 --> 01:10:11,690
nuclear explosions occur in government
labs where they were like, you know,

1338
01:10:11,691 --> 01:10:15,530
we do a lot of that matrix multiply and
add to can we try to see if we could use

1339
01:10:15,531 --> 01:10:19,820
it? And so it was like a
skunkworks project management
had no resources against

1340
01:10:19,821 --> 01:10:20,001
this.

1341
01:10:20,001 --> 01:10:23,630
I knew actually one of the first four
customers working on this r and d area of

1342
01:10:23,631 --> 01:10:26,960
all things to model how neurons fire,
um, scientific model model model.

1343
01:10:26,961 --> 01:10:27,930
How Neuron Actually,
oh,

1344
01:10:27,940 --> 01:10:31,620
how actual biology of a neuron down to
as much detail as possible coming to call

1345
01:10:31,621 --> 01:10:34,360
it evolves machines. And uh,
they were using gps and I,

1346
01:10:34,470 --> 01:10:38,600
and I remember years ago seeing, wait,
you just bought for $2,000 at the local,

1347
01:10:38,780 --> 01:10:42,440
we call it was Fry's and
then Fry's electronics store.

1348
01:10:42,590 --> 01:10:46,010
You just bought more power than any
supercomputer of just two years ago for

1349
01:10:46,011 --> 01:10:48,710
$2,000 because of this domain.
Right?

1350
01:10:48,711 --> 01:10:52,490
So this incredible computer resource
was pushed to the limits from gaming.

1351
01:10:52,820 --> 01:10:57,050
And I think almost poetically when you
think about rendering three dimensional

1352
01:10:57,051 --> 01:10:58,670
worlds in making the photorealistic,

1353
01:10:58,700 --> 01:11:00,980
you're doing something our brain
does exquisitely well, right?

1354
01:11:00,981 --> 01:11:04,520
We get an avalanche of information on
our retina, in our CORTEX and wheat down.

1355
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:09,410
Scale that to image recognition,
building over there, your face,

1356
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:10,890
the symmetry of your eyes and,
and,

1357
01:11:10,891 --> 01:11:14,700
and much like a neural network when you
train them. It recapitulates our biology,

1358
01:11:14,701 --> 01:11:18,270
it builds edge detectors
and then symmetry detectors.

1359
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:20,680
And then I face things and you,

1360
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:22,950
cause you can probe what's been built a
little bit and get a sense, oh my God,

1361
01:11:22,951 --> 01:11:26,070
it just recapitulated the sensory
cortex in an artificial system.

1362
01:11:26,070 --> 01:11:30,300
That's when the recapitulated meaning
recreate it from scratch. It's an analog,

1363
01:11:30,301 --> 01:11:33,720
sorry. Cause you're just training it like
a baby gets born, right. Opens its eyes,

1364
01:11:33,730 --> 01:11:34,790
starts learning. Right, right.

1365
01:11:34,950 --> 01:11:37,020
That's the same general thing going
on with these neural networks.

1366
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:40,440
The fact that it has similar layers
in his visual system as our babies do.

1367
01:11:40,710 --> 01:11:44,580
But it's just like, that's
when people like me like, oh
my God, this is incredible.

1368
01:11:44,581 --> 01:11:48,630
Right. So, um, back to, uh, the GPU thing,

1369
01:11:48,810 --> 01:11:52,860
what I think is poetic is that something
that in a sense is meant to be as

1370
01:11:52,861 --> 01:11:56,820
realistic as possible to our vision system
has the kind of computational systems

1371
01:11:56,821 --> 01:11:59,850
we need to in fact do vision
systems in like, let's do,

1372
01:11:59,860 --> 01:12:03,660
let's recognize cats and internet or
let's recognize cancer and a pathology

1373
01:12:03,661 --> 01:12:08,280
slide that those general constructs
occur because our brain has evolved to do

1374
01:12:08,281 --> 01:12:13,281
data reduction and pattern recognition
in the world in a way that is optimal for

1375
01:12:13,801 --> 01:12:16,530
what we do. So that when we
build these neural networks,

1376
01:12:16,531 --> 01:12:19,590
what do they really good at?
All the same stuff like,

1377
01:12:19,740 --> 01:12:22,290
and so all the applications they
are in like speech processing,

1378
01:12:22,470 --> 01:12:25,260
visual processing, which is the
simple stuff, the edge of our cortex.

1379
01:12:25,261 --> 01:12:28,320
And then naturally it's gonna start
moving into emotional systems and in the

1380
01:12:28,321 --> 01:12:31,590
frontal lobe and the rest
of our critical systems.

1381
01:12:31,650 --> 01:12:33,930
And so that's why I think it's
the obvious path to AI in the,

1382
01:12:33,931 --> 01:12:34,830
in the broadest sense.

1383
01:12:37,340 --> 01:12:39,080
So many questions. Jay, the,

1384
01:12:39,420 --> 01:12:44,420
I love that story for where that story
slash explanation for a number of

1385
01:12:44,661 --> 01:12:46,040
reasons.
One is,

1386
01:12:47,130 --> 01:12:47,690
yeah,

1387
01:12:47,690 --> 01:12:52,690
how careful one should be with dismissing
certain fields or even if they seem

1388
01:12:54,141 --> 01:12:56,810
trivial or a wait to be a waste
of time like gaming, right.

1389
01:12:56,811 --> 01:13:01,280
If you look at the byproduct
of the incentives that
drove that and then the off

1390
01:13:01,281 --> 01:13:04,490
label uses of GP use our gps,

1391
01:13:04,550 --> 01:13:09,550
I'm mistaken in thinking that they also
have a role in a cryptocurrency mining.

1392
01:13:10,030 --> 01:13:12,370
Oh absolutely. Right. So the, the um, the,

1393
01:13:12,470 --> 01:13:16,390
that's a very computationally intense
task and so it moved definitely from until

1394
01:13:16,391 --> 01:13:20,890
like CPU to GPU but then even went
further than I went to these field

1395
01:13:20,891 --> 01:13:21,800
programmable gateways.

1396
01:13:21,850 --> 01:13:25,210
And then the custom chips designed from
scratch and sort of it quickly went down

1397
01:13:25,211 --> 01:13:27,340
that path and deep learning
chips will as well.

1398
01:13:27,550 --> 01:13:30,610
There was one of my investment themes
the last few years is that deep learning

1399
01:13:30,611 --> 01:13:32,380
is doing the exact same thing.
Two custom chips.

1400
01:13:33,100 --> 01:13:36,050
She mentioned something much earlier.
One last thing on this.

1401
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:40,480
So you gotta take a Nvidia summarize
something amazing and also out of Google

1402
01:13:40,481 --> 01:13:41,200
did a paper,

1403
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:46,120
the majority of code at Google
now is built by a computer,

1404
01:13:46,121 --> 01:13:46,954
not by human.

1405
01:13:47,110 --> 01:13:49,990
Cause that's one weird way of summarizing
this is when you train a neural

1406
01:13:49,991 --> 01:13:51,550
network, you're not coding, you know,

1407
01:13:51,551 --> 01:13:55,750
if then else you're setting up the
same thing you set up every time.

1408
01:13:55,900 --> 01:13:58,600
I mean that's to fungible. It's a
very fungible skill set, by the way.

1409
01:13:59,020 --> 01:14:02,950
And you train it and use the computers
generating its own executable.

1410
01:14:02,951 --> 01:14:03,790
At the end of the day,

1411
01:14:04,450 --> 01:14:09,220
the majority of programming is that
way now by by a factor of 10 so wild.

1412
01:14:09,221 --> 01:14:13,000
Yeah. And every product that Google
embodies it from search to you name it,

1413
01:14:13,001 --> 01:14:15,600
it's like that is the
key technological things.

1414
01:14:15,601 --> 01:14:16,960
Striping across every Google product.

1415
01:14:17,770 --> 01:14:21,940
So you're so excited by the science,
by the engineering.

1416
01:14:23,650 --> 01:14:28,360
You mentioned product manager while
back and you did in fact do that for a

1417
01:14:28,361 --> 01:14:32,350
period of time. Right. So Yep.
What I've observed, not always,

1418
01:14:32,351 --> 01:14:35,440
but very often at least did
when I lived in Silicon Valley.

1419
01:14:35,441 --> 01:14:40,441
Certainly that a lot of engineers have
a severe disdain or at the very least a

1420
01:14:41,531 --> 01:14:46,180
distaste for all things. Most things
marketing related. Right, right.

1421
01:14:46,210 --> 01:14:49,960
It's just, I remember that HP, just
a bunch of like hand waving. Yeah.

1422
01:14:50,090 --> 01:14:54,700
The shyness them, I mean hell yeah. So
many levels. So, so what, why did you,

1423
01:14:54,701 --> 01:14:59,560
with the background, you have set
your sights on product managing.

1424
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:02,930
Yeah, so I remember exactly how this
happened. I was at I getting that right,

1425
01:15:03,610 --> 01:15:05,450
product management, product
marketing, product management,

1426
01:15:05,980 --> 01:15:07,620
that's actually the word I
was looking for. Sorry. In,

1427
01:15:07,621 --> 01:15:10,670
in different firms use the terms
differently, but I was open to both. Um,

1428
01:15:10,671 --> 01:15:13,860
some cases it's more engineering
rich, other cases, it's whatever.

1429
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:15,520
So when I was at HP,

1430
01:15:15,521 --> 01:15:19,660
I was in chip design and marketing was
in a different building as it often is.

1431
01:15:20,170 --> 01:15:25,170
And I basically was getting frustrated
even though it was not there very long on

1432
01:15:26,951 --> 01:15:28,780
what I saw all around me,
at least at HP,

1433
01:15:28,781 --> 01:15:30,820
which was where promote from
within culture, you know,

1434
01:15:30,821 --> 01:15:33,520
over 20 years it'll become an engineering
manager. And he's like, you know,

1435
01:15:33,521 --> 01:15:37,900
most people, they were lifers as we
call them. And that seem kind of long.

1436
01:15:37,901 --> 01:15:40,750
It's like I really, really dedicate the
rest of my life to that career path.

1437
01:15:40,751 --> 01:15:42,220
And then I was like, well,
how can I accelerate this?

1438
01:15:42,221 --> 01:15:45,790
And that's one of the first idea came off.
I somewhat got into marketing and had,

1439
01:15:45,820 --> 01:15:45,971
you know,

1440
01:15:45,971 --> 01:15:48,900
it seemed like the boss has more than
just one narrow functional domain.

1441
01:15:48,940 --> 01:15:49,271
Like I mean,
yeah,

1442
01:15:49,271 --> 01:15:52,750
she gets an experience over there and
then I'd be more of an engineering manager

1443
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:55,750
if I could know more than just my
narrow bear end of engineering.

1444
01:15:55,751 --> 01:15:58,690
I thought being in a dream manager was
the end goal and learning a bit about

1445
01:15:58,691 --> 01:16:01,540
marketing and product marketing
because that was the mystery. Like how,

1446
01:16:01,930 --> 01:16:04,360
how are all these decisions that
seem to implicate, you know,

1447
01:16:04,361 --> 01:16:07,570
the sort of impact our product development
cycles and products it and canceled,

1448
01:16:07,870 --> 01:16:10,980
you know, things succeeding or failing
in the market. That seemed important on,

1449
01:16:11,290 --> 01:16:14,230
on what I was doing and not just didn't
make a breakthrough. So I wasn't,

1450
01:16:14,231 --> 01:16:18,280
I guess you could say I wasn't a scientist
in my profession of well I'm just

1451
01:16:18,281 --> 01:16:21,070
doing it to learn the
best way to do something.

1452
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:24,970
I was engineering the through and through,
which is I want to have an impact.

1453
01:16:25,090 --> 01:16:27,880
I don't want to design a widget that's
going to sit in a room and they will get

1454
01:16:27,881 --> 01:16:29,440
used just cause I like to design widgets.

1455
01:16:29,441 --> 01:16:31,900
It's like it really would love to have
something to be meaningful in the world.

1456
01:16:31,930 --> 01:16:34,960
And so that's why I thought about that.
And yes,

1457
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:36,660
there was a big disdain for marketing,
uh,

1458
01:16:36,661 --> 01:16:39,970
amongst the engineers
that I worked with and uh,

1459
01:16:40,270 --> 01:16:42,330
and I did finally get
the chance that that is,

1460
01:16:42,340 --> 01:16:43,540
I wanted to work with Steve Jobs as well.

1461
01:16:43,541 --> 01:16:47,200
So I got a chance to work at apple and
next software it's called next is when

1462
01:16:47,201 --> 01:16:49,930
they were moving out of the hardware
business into the software only. So,

1463
01:16:49,990 --> 01:16:54,390
but next as it was called, um, and I would
leave wasn't for me either though. Uh,

1464
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:56,890
I just didn't,
some things just didn't click about.

1465
01:16:56,920 --> 01:17:00,870
I think maybe in my short attention span
and my interest in diverse things, uh,

1466
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:05,350
that hunkering down to any one thing
in committing to do it for five years

1467
01:17:05,380 --> 01:17:08,350
seemed anathema to my s my course.

1468
01:17:08,351 --> 01:17:10,320
That's why I left the phd
program after two quarters.

1469
01:17:10,321 --> 01:17:12,020
And like I'm not going to
write a thesis that's like,

1470
01:17:12,250 --> 01:17:14,900
like spent four years on one little
narrow area of actually neural networks

1471
01:17:14,901 --> 01:17:16,350
would have been my thesis area,

1472
01:17:16,351 --> 01:17:19,250
specifically neural networks and played
the parallel processing computers was

1473
01:17:19,251 --> 01:17:20,990
what I was starting down.
Uh,

1474
01:17:21,020 --> 01:17:22,760
I would have been fascinated by
that but it would have been 20,

1475
01:17:22,761 --> 01:17:25,220
20 years too early. Um, anyway. Uh,

1476
01:17:25,970 --> 01:17:28,010
same thing in any operating job.

1477
01:17:28,070 --> 01:17:31,130
It's like I would be either job
hopping the way some people do, um,

1478
01:17:31,310 --> 01:17:36,020
who have this problem I have or I'd have
to be on Hattie I think in my job cause

1479
01:17:36,021 --> 01:17:38,870
it just the pace of change and
learning would stagnate so quickly.

1480
01:17:38,870 --> 01:17:40,850
I could see these patterns over months,

1481
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:44,150
not years that like I'm not learning
them as much anymore and they just

1482
01:17:44,151 --> 01:17:45,590
executing the same thing
over and over again.

1483
01:17:46,070 --> 01:17:49,190
And so management consulting was
an interesting way to play to that.

1484
01:17:49,191 --> 01:17:50,900
And like all kinds of
different client engagements,

1485
01:17:50,901 --> 01:17:54,650
it just didn't have the same agency
of making a meaningful impact.

1486
01:17:54,710 --> 01:17:58,340
You could point to sure. Very
vicarious, very diffused and ambiguous.

1487
01:17:58,341 --> 01:17:59,720
Whether you've accomplished anything.

1488
01:17:59,930 --> 01:18:02,330
And so that's why all the management
solving from say we, you know,

1489
01:18:02,390 --> 01:18:05,090
adding value all was talking about mad
at and you're measuring how much value we

1490
01:18:05,091 --> 01:18:05,924
added.

1491
01:18:06,890 --> 01:18:09,230
All these things are being said because
everyone knows in their heart and I

1492
01:18:09,231 --> 01:18:10,110
can't tell them any value.

1493
01:18:10,530 --> 01:18:13,490
How do I know if it was me or that it's
usually then we can't really sing our

1494
01:18:13,491 --> 01:18:17,180
own praises that much. So, um, so I love
the diversity of management consulting.

1495
01:18:17,180 --> 01:18:20,860
I didn't like the life balance
nor the agency. And so when,

1496
01:18:20,870 --> 01:18:23,790
when finally I discovered venture
capital and learned what it was about,

1497
01:18:23,791 --> 01:18:27,290
it was like the perfect combination
for me. Well, your investment, uh,

1498
01:18:27,350 --> 01:18:30,500
or at least that facet of
things you haven't seen the,

1499
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:33,740
the Lens of looking for things
you haven't seen before. Right?

1500
01:18:33,860 --> 01:18:38,360
That's where that also speaks right into
that. Your programming, so to speak.

1501
01:18:39,260 --> 01:18:41,360
You can see maybe that's the origin.
I hadn't connected those dots.

1502
01:18:41,361 --> 01:18:43,100
But it seems obvious now
as I say this to you,

1503
01:18:43,101 --> 01:18:48,101
that that desire to seek something new
may have been a driver of that simple

1504
01:18:48,801 --> 01:18:51,530
rule that I've been living my life by it,
which is an injustice. Something that,

1505
01:18:51,531 --> 01:18:54,950
uh, you haven't seen before. So when
you, when you're looking at companies,

1506
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:56,570
and I am going to come back to Steve Jobs,

1507
01:18:56,571 --> 01:18:59,350
I have some questions about
Steve and Ilan. I know you,

1508
01:18:59,450 --> 01:19:02,970
you've spent a good amount of time both,
uh,

1509
01:19:03,050 --> 01:19:06,080
when you're looking at these
companies that have no product,

1510
01:19:06,410 --> 01:19:08,810
that are in the idea stage,

1511
01:19:08,811 --> 01:19:13,250
I mean there may be some white papers
or publications from think tanks or

1512
01:19:13,490 --> 01:19:17,790
conference panels that
discuss these subjects. Uh,

1513
01:19:18,590 --> 01:19:23,210
how do you evaluate deals
or how do you vet deals?

1514
01:19:23,211 --> 01:19:27,620
Because I've seen a lot of people
attempt to go as early as you do,

1515
01:19:27,860 --> 01:19:32,030
but have just gotten their faces
ripped off routinely. Right? So, yeah,

1516
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:36,860
I mean there's, there are and it
particularly if you're trying to be bold,

1517
01:19:36,861 --> 01:19:41,861
so not just invest at the early stage
but also go for things that are,

1518
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:46,310
how are times, however many times
out of 10 going to fail. Uh,

1519
01:19:46,311 --> 01:19:49,340
how do you avoid running out of bankroll?
Right.

1520
01:19:49,341 --> 01:19:54,341
I mean I'd love to just hear
a little bit about what you,

1521
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:59,870
what you look for in a situation
like that at that embryonic stage.

1522
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:03,260
What are the check boxes that
help you to risk mitigate,

1523
01:20:03,350 --> 01:20:07,920
if that's even a consideration though
is um, well, sort of risk mitigation.

1524
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:09,990
Windex spray. Yeah. This is the last one.

1525
01:20:10,050 --> 01:20:14,440
How many up cause but part of the luck I
had in starting in the best dinner sort

1526
01:20:14,441 --> 01:20:17,940
of economic boom for venture, you
could imagine the.com boom, right?

1527
01:20:17,941 --> 01:20:21,660
No small amounts of capital hello
companies to scale incredibly rapidly.

1528
01:20:21,661 --> 01:20:24,510
There wasn't really historical precedent
for something that good for venture

1529
01:20:24,511 --> 01:20:26,970
capital.
So chock part of this up to luck.

1530
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:30,810
But the side effect then lasted is
that I didn't have that fearful moment.

1531
01:20:30,811 --> 01:20:34,110
I didn't slog through 10 years of just
banging my head against the wall of

1532
01:20:34,111 --> 01:20:35,520
failure, failure, failure, failure.

1533
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:38,610
It just was like shooting fish
in a barrel to start, right?

1534
01:20:38,611 --> 01:20:42,660
So that I think helped me a build enough
track record that people would give me

1535
01:20:42,661 --> 01:20:46,020
a bit more slack to pursue something
right within my partnership, for example,

1536
01:20:46,021 --> 01:20:47,090
to pursue ideas that,

1537
01:20:47,190 --> 01:20:50,400
that I can't imagine what life would be
like how I was stuck in a partnership

1538
01:20:50,580 --> 01:20:53,190
that wouldn't give me credibility or
let me run with some ideas. Right.

1539
01:20:53,191 --> 01:20:55,400
And they certainly would push
back, believe me, Oh, space.

1540
01:20:55,410 --> 01:20:57,630
The next bunch of companies like
really you're going to doesn't rugged.

1541
01:20:57,631 --> 01:21:00,060
So you kidding me? So I get, I'd
have to defend some of these,

1542
01:21:00,061 --> 01:21:02,850
but I didn't get the, no, no,
no, you can't do this. Right.

1543
01:21:02,851 --> 01:21:07,630
So that if I hadn't had that capacity to,

1544
01:21:08,410 --> 01:21:13,380
in other words, to avoid the inner voice
of doubt and the overt expert, a critic,

1545
01:21:13,410 --> 01:21:14,550
right.
And both internal and external,

1546
01:21:14,551 --> 01:21:18,920
I don't think I could've done what I did
in the, in the subsequent years. So, um,

1547
01:21:19,710 --> 01:21:22,720
fast forward to let's say midway through
my career into the present day. Um,

1548
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:25,470
so was the startup phase is a little
different than the steady state.

1549
01:21:25,471 --> 01:21:28,470
So now that we're in a steady
state and I can realize, okay,

1550
01:21:28,471 --> 01:21:29,220
there'll be some failures,

1551
01:21:29,220 --> 01:21:33,360
that's fine in what I then look for is a
combination of some personal attributes,

1552
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:38,900
marketing attributes and weirdly of late
sort of process technology attributes.

1553
01:21:39,660 --> 01:21:40,950
So I would have in the past said,
oh,

1554
01:21:40,951 --> 01:21:43,960
technology breakthrough of course there
has to be, you know, people, you know,

1555
01:21:44,010 --> 01:21:47,730
huge market and something disruptive in
the technology domain that didn't like

1556
01:21:47,731 --> 01:21:50,580
to nanotechnology or something that like
we couldn't have done this five years

1557
01:21:50,581 --> 01:21:50,910
ago.

1558
01:21:50,910 --> 01:21:55,350
Oh that's another question I always ask
every entrepreneur either explicitly or

1559
01:21:55,351 --> 01:21:57,180
implicitly if I know the
answer I need to ask it,

1560
01:21:57,181 --> 01:22:00,630
which is could you start this business
five years ago? And if the answer is yes,

1561
01:22:00,631 --> 01:22:04,560
then I don't want to invest. What are
their questions? What are other questions?

1562
01:22:04,730 --> 01:22:05,850
One I love to ask is,

1563
01:22:05,851 --> 01:22:08,850
so what does this business look
like in 10 years and 20 years out?

1564
01:22:09,030 --> 01:22:14,030
And what is mind boggling is unfortunately
how this weeds out the charlatans and

1565
01:22:14,761 --> 01:22:17,190
the, you know, arbitrage seeking
opportunities like nothing else.

1566
01:22:17,191 --> 01:22:18,210
Or they just like deer in the headlights.

1567
01:22:18,210 --> 01:22:20,700
They never thought 10 years or 20
years old, they don't have any idea.

1568
01:22:21,150 --> 01:22:24,540
And it's not because things change so
rapidly that you can't predict 10 or 20

1569
01:22:24,541 --> 01:22:25,650
years so that they don't have a mission,

1570
01:22:25,980 --> 01:22:28,320
they don't have a purpose for why
they're starting their business. Right.

1571
01:22:28,321 --> 01:22:30,900
If you ask Elon Musk that he knows
right away, he has planet labs,

1572
01:22:30,901 --> 01:22:32,220
he knows right away,
yes Zuckerberg,

1573
01:22:32,260 --> 01:22:35,190
he knows right away you ask Larry
Page and Larry and Sergei Brin,

1574
01:22:35,310 --> 01:22:39,720
they know right away what their business
looks like in 10 and 20 years and they

1575
01:22:39,721 --> 01:22:43,020
have a mission statement that they hold
to throughout their entire life and it

1576
01:22:43,890 --> 01:22:46,840
galvanizes the team. It
motivates them to, you know,

1577
01:22:46,970 --> 01:22:49,140
that's why they're in business.
Other people that are,

1578
01:22:49,180 --> 01:22:50,690
I call them arbitrize seekers,
uh,

1579
01:22:50,820 --> 01:22:53,190
when people flock from some industry
cause there's gold in the hills,

1580
01:22:54,420 --> 01:22:57,190
you want to weed that out, this is a great
way to weed that out, right? He's just,

1581
01:22:57,210 --> 01:23:00,750
people don't tend to have
long term visions if they
don't really have a purpose

1582
01:23:00,751 --> 01:23:05,070
for what they're doing. Um,
so, uh, so on the people side,

1583
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:08,620
I increasingly have become enamored
with purpose driven businesses as I was

1584
01:23:08,621 --> 01:23:11,410
mentioning or mission driven businesses
were making money is not the prime

1585
01:23:11,411 --> 01:23:11,831
objective.

1586
01:23:11,831 --> 01:23:15,520
It's the byproduct of the way they
intend to change the world to usher in,

1587
01:23:15,850 --> 01:23:16,181
you know,

1588
01:23:16,181 --> 01:23:20,500
the transition to sustainable transport
in clean energy to colonize Mars as a

1589
01:23:20,501 --> 01:23:24,340
couple of easily understood examples.
Those are both unique.

1590
01:23:24,370 --> 01:23:26,140
There aren't any other
startups at the time, you know,

1591
01:23:26,141 --> 01:23:28,200
proposing that to colonize Mars.
Um,

1592
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:31,750
nor is it something that you get
done in a short period of time.

1593
01:23:31,780 --> 01:23:34,930
It's like the star on the horizon that,
that galvanizes so much action.

1594
01:23:36,430 --> 01:23:39,520
Do you want me to look back though
the to the, the overall categories,

1595
01:23:39,521 --> 01:23:44,130
the process stuff and the other little
and here about some of the attributes?

1596
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:46,480
Yeah, sure. So on the
market size, I think,

1597
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:49,960
I think a lot of venture investors in
the early stage would have the following

1598
01:23:49,961 --> 01:23:51,040
common answer to your question.

1599
01:23:51,070 --> 01:23:55,900
I invest in good people pursuing big
ideas in enormous markets. Right. Okay.

1600
01:23:56,440 --> 01:24:00,460
Um, but sometimes they actually won't
execute on that because enormous markets

1601
01:24:00,490 --> 01:24:04,960
usually means that it's
something really radical,

1602
01:24:04,961 --> 01:24:06,790
that changing.
There's a lot of unpredictability.

1603
01:24:06,791 --> 01:24:10,330
So if you're investing in ride sharing
as you did right before it was obviously

1604
01:24:10,331 --> 01:24:10,781
a good idea.

1605
01:24:10,781 --> 01:24:13,210
It was not obviously a good idea and most
of them people probably thought it was

1606
01:24:13,350 --> 01:24:15,010
a really bad idea. Well, there was a,

1607
01:24:15,020 --> 01:24:19,510
there was an email that a naval
Ravikant put up not too long ago, uh,

1608
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:23,770
which was the, the email that
was sent out through Angel List,

1609
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:24,940
which was uh,

1610
01:24:25,110 --> 01:24:29,860
ignored by something like
297 people out of 300.

1611
01:24:30,370 --> 01:24:33,530
Exactly.
It was not clearly a great idea actually.

1612
01:24:33,820 --> 01:24:36,490
I would say like when I first
invested in Hotmail, I felt this,

1613
01:24:36,491 --> 01:24:39,700
I felt that when we first invested
in Skype side note really quickly,

1614
01:24:39,701 --> 01:24:43,120
just cause I'm cheating, I'm cheating a
little bit here and I didn't know this.

1615
01:24:43,210 --> 01:24:47,140
Uh, where'd the name come from?
How much? One. Oh, hot hotmail. Um,

1616
01:24:48,510 --> 01:24:52,960
uh, it was spelled with a
capital h. T m. L. So it was, oh,

1617
01:24:52,961 --> 01:24:57,010
we're going to do web based email over
html. It's getting big age smaller. Yeah,

1618
01:24:57,011 --> 01:25:00,370
exactly. It was that Dorky
and uh, that was it. Yeah.

1619
01:25:00,371 --> 01:25:03,910
And even more interesting they,
because they are offering free email,

1620
01:25:03,911 --> 01:25:07,030
they put a lot of effort
into the free aspect of this.

1621
01:25:07,031 --> 01:25:10,810
So they located in Fremont,
California on Liberty Avenue.

1622
01:25:11,050 --> 01:25:14,140
They launched on the 4th of July,
which is a national holiday.

1623
01:25:14,141 --> 01:25:18,630
So they got no news
pickup. Yeah, that's right.

1624
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:23,100
It's all free TV. So anyway,
those companies were widely
regarded as bad ideas.

1625
01:25:23,410 --> 01:25:26,860
Severe of hotmail famously was turned
down by 21 venture capitalist before he

1626
01:25:26,861 --> 01:25:30,400
found us.
And I would say without a doubt,

1627
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:34,270
because I've met the number
these venture people at the time,

1628
01:25:34,300 --> 01:25:36,640
the series a was happening
for Ebay and Google.

1629
01:25:36,820 --> 01:25:40,060
The vast majority venture capitalists
would not invested in series a. In fact,

1630
01:25:40,330 --> 01:25:43,180
after the series they of Google that two
primary investors demanded to get their

1631
01:25:43,181 --> 01:25:47,320
money back. They want it to be redeemed
at cost because of a little spat.

1632
01:25:47,321 --> 01:25:49,180
They're having lots of
founders not getting a new CEO,

1633
01:25:49,630 --> 01:25:52,540
a not well known fact or one
of the major venture investors.

1634
01:25:52,541 --> 01:25:56,070
And apple sold their entire steak pre IPO.
You know,

1635
01:25:56,071 --> 01:25:57,970
they still brag about being an
investor in apple of course.

1636
01:25:57,971 --> 01:26:02,971
But people lose faith in the greatest
companies that have invested in a newer

1637
01:26:03,050 --> 01:26:07,760
bouncing around a lot. But I that that is,
that is what I like to do. So I, I was,

1638
01:26:07,940 --> 01:26:10,010
I was doing a bit of homework and uh,

1639
01:26:10,011 --> 01:26:14,210
you were very helpful in sending
me links to a few things.

1640
01:26:14,211 --> 01:26:17,390
One was an interview with Jason
Calacanis. Oh yeah, I love that guy.

1641
01:26:17,450 --> 01:26:22,450
And you had created a very
nifty index of subject on your,

1642
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:25,550
on your, uh, flicker account.

1643
01:26:25,610 --> 01:26:30,610
And one of the bullets was why I never
sell shares of our companies and biggest

1644
01:26:32,571 --> 01:26:36,340
misses also. But, uh, could you
explain what you mean by that?

1645
01:26:36,390 --> 01:26:39,620
I'm sure we listen what is never so never,
never sell.

1646
01:26:39,650 --> 01:26:42,830
It's a wonderfully liberating stance.
And at first people were like, yeah,

1647
01:26:43,010 --> 01:26:46,400
I can see your fish. Like, wait, that
doesn't make sense. You know, buy low,

1648
01:26:46,401 --> 01:26:49,910
sell high is kind of a munch.
Yeah, no, I've never sold a share.

1649
01:26:49,911 --> 01:26:54,300
Now let me add the caveat when I have
control. So the vast majority of time, uh,

1650
01:26:54,620 --> 01:26:57,380
in our business this would apply,
which is we invest in a startup.

1651
01:26:57,410 --> 01:26:59,540
It either has an IPO or it gets acquired.

1652
01:26:59,541 --> 01:27:03,710
Those are the two outcomes where it
has a quote liquidity event, an IPO,

1653
01:27:03,711 --> 01:27:08,360
some point after the IPO, you know,
years later, or at least 180 days later,

1654
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:11,000
a venture for, and we'll distribute
those shares to its investors.

1655
01:27:11,001 --> 01:27:14,850
So I as the general partner gets shared,
so I get shares of Tesla,

1656
01:27:14,851 --> 01:27:18,260
I get shares of you name it right now
what I choose to do that as my own

1657
01:27:18,261 --> 01:27:21,230
personal decision, right? And from
that point on, I've never sold a shirt.

1658
01:27:21,260 --> 01:27:24,020
Now what I do is give him
the charity over time.

1659
01:27:24,050 --> 01:27:25,940
And some might argue that's
kind of a sales decision,

1660
01:27:25,941 --> 01:27:30,590
but not entirely be partially because
it's not like I'm trying to time the

1661
01:27:30,591 --> 01:27:34,240
market. I'm betting on
them in perpetuity. And,

1662
01:27:34,420 --> 01:27:36,920
and I'll give you another answer to why
I do this. In a moment, but let me just,

1663
01:27:36,980 --> 01:27:40,500
let me flesh this one out a little
more. This has been wonderfully, um,

1664
01:27:40,640 --> 01:27:44,810
goal aligning with entrepreneurs because
if I'm thinking when is the time to

1665
01:27:44,811 --> 01:27:45,291
punch out?

1666
01:27:45,291 --> 01:27:48,920
It's kind of a corrosive thought process
when they're thinking I the ones I like

1667
01:27:49,220 --> 01:27:51,590
one of my, what's the next 20
years look like for this business?

1668
01:27:51,591 --> 01:27:53,840
How can we make the most out of
it in this next phase of growth?

1669
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:58,460
Because the best companies are like
these sort of power laws of compounding

1670
01:27:58,461 --> 01:27:59,690
potential. They, you know,

1671
01:27:59,691 --> 01:28:02,780
would you want to be punching out and
you wouldn't write if Facebook or Google,

1672
01:28:02,781 --> 01:28:06,110
if you know, 10 years ago, God, that
would have been really bad mistake. Right.

1673
01:28:06,890 --> 01:28:09,290
And I love, actually, let me
jump to the point number two.

1674
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:13,070
Some of the very first advice I got
when I was entering this field was from

1675
01:28:13,071 --> 01:28:17,210
someone who had spent their entire
career at the Rockefeller Group.

1676
01:28:17,211 --> 01:28:17,931
I forget what she was,

1677
01:28:17,931 --> 01:28:20,810
foundation or somethings and he's Peter
Crisp and I remember him vividly because

1678
01:28:20,811 --> 01:28:22,490
we were,
I think my first week on the job,

1679
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:25,280
it was our first pitch to
people who give us money.

1680
01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:29,480
And here I met someone who has
just coming off a long career,

1681
01:28:29,481 --> 01:28:32,230
sort of winding down, slowly off a
long illustrious career investing.

1682
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:36,650
Some of the best companies
you can imagine. And he's
two comments to me were, wow,

1683
01:28:36,651 --> 01:28:37,940
first I'm super envious.

1684
01:28:37,980 --> 01:28:40,880
And this young group of people that
starting your career right now,

1685
01:28:40,881 --> 01:28:43,100
this looks like you're going to love this.

1686
01:28:43,101 --> 01:28:46,550
I wish I was your age doing this again,
this whole second wave.

1687
01:28:46,551 --> 01:28:47,360
So I just liked it.

1688
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:50,090
Here I am changing careers as we mentioned
earlier and not sure which careers

1689
01:28:50,091 --> 01:28:51,740
are made from me that I had
to hear something like that.

1690
01:28:52,190 --> 01:28:54,170
And the second thing is looking
back over his whole career,

1691
01:28:54,171 --> 01:28:56,780
he wished he had never sold anything
and that I had a similar reaction.

1692
01:28:56,810 --> 01:28:58,280
What do you mean? He goes, well,

1693
01:28:58,310 --> 01:29:03,030
I tried to time the market and if I had
just held onto my apple shares, right,

1694
01:29:03,090 --> 01:29:06,330
and who cares what it happened. Everything
else like the, as if held value today,

1695
01:29:06,360 --> 01:29:08,850
it would've trumped everything else.
I'd be a much richer man.

1696
01:29:08,851 --> 01:29:10,290
I would have avoided all that anxiety.

1697
01:29:10,590 --> 01:29:13,500
And that echoed in the back of
my mind to this day. So in my,

1698
01:29:13,860 --> 01:29:15,000
I won't show this specifics,

1699
01:29:15,001 --> 01:29:17,850
but in my personal portfolio there was
a similar power of mother as a single

1700
01:29:17,851 --> 01:29:20,670
company that's worth more than everything
else combined because I've never sold

1701
01:29:20,671 --> 01:29:23,100
a share.
And then if I look at number two,

1702
01:29:23,130 --> 01:29:25,800
may I have to actually go back and do
the math number two plus number three

1703
01:29:25,801 --> 01:29:28,980
probably that kind of think about it
as long tail exceeds everything else

1704
01:29:28,981 --> 01:29:33,630
combined. So it's like a traditional
power law and that is pretty amazing.

1705
01:29:34,530 --> 01:29:39,000
So I just like when I made this decision
and also around the same time to give

1706
01:29:39,001 --> 01:29:39,661
it all to charity.

1707
01:29:39,661 --> 01:29:42,660
That was another thing that created a
living trust to give everything about a

1708
01:29:42,661 --> 01:29:45,690
small fixed dollar amount to the kids.
Everything else going to go to charity.

1709
01:29:46,140 --> 01:29:48,900
Then when you have a major crashes,
it's not like,

1710
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:51,050
I know this is gonna sound weird.
I don't stress it.

1711
01:29:51,051 --> 01:29:53,670
I just lost 90% of my net worth.
Cause that happened once. It's like,

1712
01:29:53,700 --> 01:29:56,020
oh the charity just lost 90%
of his net worth, you know.

1713
01:29:56,070 --> 01:29:59,250
And so I was able to write it through
when it came right back cause I didn't

1714
01:29:59,251 --> 01:30:03,930
panic and sell when I literally lost 90%.
My net worth. Um, I don't recall seeing,

1715
01:30:03,931 --> 01:30:06,240
I don't remember who it was,
but one of the,

1716
01:30:06,241 --> 01:30:08,060
and there aren't that many as you know,
uh,

1717
01:30:08,100 --> 01:30:13,100
but a tier venture capital
firms looked at their return on

1718
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:20,460
something or they're returned
to limited partners of the,

1719
01:30:20,461 --> 01:30:24,510
let's just call it 10 companies that had,
uh,

1720
01:30:24,660 --> 01:30:27,630
reached IPO and that they
subsequently distributed.

1721
01:30:28,100 --> 01:30:33,100
And they compared that with the amount
made by someone who would have invested

1722
01:30:35,010 --> 01:30:39,720
the amount in the companies at first
opportunity at IPO and written it out

1723
01:30:39,721 --> 01:30:44,500
something like five years. And they would
have made just as much money in, in,

1724
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:47,010
in most of the cases. Uh, yeah,

1725
01:30:47,011 --> 01:30:49,830
there was a fun called
technology crossover ventures
I think formed with that

1726
01:30:49,860 --> 01:30:53,650
insight in mind that says if you can
pick some winners still private in,

1727
01:30:53,680 --> 01:30:55,950
in and have a judgment from
seeing the track record,

1728
01:30:56,010 --> 01:30:59,400
the passion of the entrepreneur
or a number of years, and
then load up the boat,

1729
01:30:59,430 --> 01:31:01,420
either just pre IPO or at IPO.
Yeah.

1730
01:31:01,580 --> 01:31:04,050
That you can put a large amount
of capital to work in that.

1731
01:31:04,051 --> 01:31:07,350
But the key was it was those prior
years of exposure that really gave you

1732
01:31:07,351 --> 01:31:07,771
confidence.

1733
01:31:07,771 --> 01:31:12,000
So like my years with elan allow me to
look at him in a very different way than

1734
01:31:12,001 --> 01:31:12,990
other than entrepreneurs. Right. Yeah.

1735
01:31:12,991 --> 01:31:16,650
And if you just literally had no prior
data and he just walked in off the street,

1736
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:19,800
I would, you really know.
You see, you mentioned deal.

1737
01:31:19,810 --> 01:31:24,810
So you spent time with jobs, Elon,
many other impressive folks. But what,

1738
01:31:24,811 --> 01:31:27,360
what are the commonalities
you've observed?

1739
01:31:27,390 --> 01:31:31,860
Biggest commonalities,
biggest differences between those two?

1740
01:31:32,340 --> 01:31:32,821
Sure.
Well,

1741
01:31:32,821 --> 01:31:36,540
let me start with differences because I
think it's tempting to draw an analogy

1742
01:31:36,541 --> 01:31:38,970
and I have been tempted to trust me.
Um,

1743
01:31:39,060 --> 01:31:41,250
but I think it's really important to
keep in mind. So I'll start there.

1744
01:31:41,251 --> 01:31:42,570
There's pretty big differences.

1745
01:31:42,571 --> 01:31:47,571
Jobs was as a marketing centric individual
with very weak engineering shops.

1746
01:31:48,030 --> 01:31:48,420
Uh,

1747
01:31:48,420 --> 01:31:53,420
Ilan is more of a physicist
turned engineer slash
computer scientist basically

1748
01:31:54,150 --> 01:31:55,320
deep engineering chops,

1749
01:31:55,350 --> 01:32:00,130
thinks of everything from first principles
of what can be done from physics and

1750
01:32:00,131 --> 01:32:04,720
then scales up to the product vision
jobs. It's much more of a, you know,

1751
01:32:04,721 --> 01:32:06,850
like almost a zen Buddhist approach too.

1752
01:32:06,870 --> 01:32:11,870
Parsimonious design and the and the
visceral agitation of its imperfection in

1753
01:32:12,311 --> 01:32:13,570
design space.
You know,

1754
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:18,040
his famous calligraphy font thing and
getting rid of all the buttons from the

1755
01:32:18,041 --> 01:32:21,670
phone. There's all these like maniacal
missions he'd had where at no point did he

1756
01:32:21,671 --> 01:32:23,860
clearly lay out like,
well here's the business strategy.

1757
01:32:23,861 --> 01:32:26,590
Like you get rid of the buttons,
everything lives in the cloud.

1758
01:32:26,591 --> 01:32:28,780
You have software services layer
you can iterate more quickly.

1759
01:32:28,930 --> 01:32:31,780
Like this is going to be an
awesome business opportunity
from get rid of all the

1760
01:32:31,781 --> 01:32:34,870
buttons and things like that and say no
buttons or ugly. Get rid of them though.

1761
01:32:35,330 --> 01:32:38,090
That's that shit. That design is
shit. You know, he would say, um,

1762
01:32:38,140 --> 01:32:42,400
but it wouldn't really give this like, ah,
I get it. That's the master plan, right?

1763
01:32:42,580 --> 01:32:46,360
Whereas Ilan is like master plan, part
one, master plan part do in the French.

1764
01:32:47,290 --> 01:32:50,110
He lays it all out and he's basically
executed according to the master plan and

1765
01:32:50,111 --> 01:32:55,000
there's actually a really well thought
out series of steps to get from here to

1766
01:32:55,001 --> 01:32:58,420
colonize Mars, a series of steps to
get rid of the petrochemical economy,

1767
01:32:58,421 --> 01:33:01,930
which is pretty amazing.
And it's all there for anyone through EAD.

1768
01:33:02,070 --> 01:33:05,110
That's like night and day difference.
Now, similarities, simple one, you know,

1769
01:33:05,111 --> 01:33:08,460
CEO of two companies. I think that's
interesting. Structurally, uh,

1770
01:33:08,470 --> 01:33:11,680
not too many people have the shuts
but to do that and I think by the way,

1771
01:33:11,681 --> 01:33:16,300
in both cases it allows you to focus
interestingly in a way that you couldn't

1772
01:33:16,301 --> 01:33:19,720
have ice. You're saying, sorry, I heard
that sentence to the CEO. Two companies,

1773
01:33:19,750 --> 01:33:22,630
each of them independently,
CEOs of two companies.

1774
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:25,810
[inaudible] you got Pixar and,
and and,

1775
01:33:25,860 --> 01:33:27,850
and either next or apple
depending on timeframe.

1776
01:33:28,060 --> 01:33:32,950
To be fair jobs was really not quite
the CEO at Pixar, but he was by title.

1777
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:37,750
In any case, what you can do though
is avoid meetings. Imagine, you know,

1778
01:33:37,751 --> 01:33:40,810
it's the company Holiday Party and
you just don't want to go, right?

1779
01:33:41,350 --> 01:33:42,420
No one's going to double guessing.

1780
01:33:42,421 --> 01:33:44,710
Like if you're normal CEO and then we'll
come and you avoid your own holiday

1781
01:33:44,711 --> 01:33:47,950
party. He's like, well what really,
what better thing is you have to do? Um,

1782
01:33:48,460 --> 01:33:49,690
but this,
this is awesome.

1783
01:33:49,691 --> 01:33:54,400
You can basically avoid time wasting
meetings and you have to delegate more.

1784
01:33:54,430 --> 01:33:58,630
And so in both cases it is an intriguing
thought experiment that being CEO more

1785
01:33:58,631 --> 01:34:02,440
than one company has some interesting
benefits for both companies, Huh? Yeah.

1786
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:04,750
Never thought of it. That
one. Yeah. Um, the similarity,

1787
01:34:04,751 --> 01:34:08,500
I think there's one area
in design where the, the,

1788
01:34:08,501 --> 01:34:11,760
the maniacal attention to detail.
I'm, I, I described it as this,

1789
01:34:11,810 --> 01:34:13,330
this visceral agitation that,

1790
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:17,470
I mean almost painful to Steve jobs
to see things that were not right. Um,

1791
01:34:17,500 --> 01:34:19,540
there's a bit of that in any line as well.

1792
01:34:19,570 --> 01:34:22,270
I interviewed him once about
design and it sounds so spooky.

1793
01:34:22,271 --> 01:34:26,170
We still similar in that regard,
but in a completely different wrapper,

1794
01:34:26,200 --> 01:34:31,150
meaning you wouldn't really know or
see it as a similar vector of like,

1795
01:34:31,320 --> 01:34:34,940
like both think it's just easy and maybe
it's a sign of brilliance, but it just,

1796
01:34:35,090 --> 01:34:40,090
there's certain parts of this whole
space that are intuitive and they do

1797
01:34:40,211 --> 01:34:44,530
naturally. And I wish I knew how to a
do it myself and be spotted and others,

1798
01:34:44,890 --> 01:34:46,420
right. So everyone wants
to, wants to ask like,

1799
01:34:46,450 --> 01:34:48,810
how can I raise my kid to be like
Elon? Or how can I, you know,

1800
01:34:48,940 --> 01:34:51,580
find entrepreneurs that are like him.
And if you,

1801
01:34:51,610 --> 01:34:55,660
if you think about just one element of
that and how miraculous it is to be able

1802
01:34:55,661 --> 01:34:59,550
to go into a number of industries,
you know, commercial banking,

1803
01:34:59,551 --> 01:35:02,780
are you leave with paypal,
the aerospace industry with space x,

1804
01:35:02,781 --> 01:35:07,190
the automotive sector, um, the, you know,
the energy competing with utilities,

1805
01:35:07,191 --> 01:35:10,250
with the solar city idea, really
left field. Now it's part of Tesla.

1806
01:35:10,251 --> 01:35:13,280
But when it started, it was really a left
field sector. It wasn't one industry.

1807
01:35:13,281 --> 01:35:14,630
I was like, well, that's
energy generation.

1808
01:35:14,631 --> 01:35:17,120
That's like competing with
regulated utilities. Um,

1809
01:35:17,480 --> 01:35:21,680
without any prior business experience
in those sectors to become the dominant

1810
01:35:21,681 --> 01:35:24,020
company in all of them,
to have failed at none of them,

1811
01:35:24,350 --> 01:35:28,610
to be the most important company in all
those fields is kind of mind boggling.

1812
01:35:29,110 --> 01:35:31,250
So as an immigrant, I forgot, right?

1813
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:35,210
And the thing that I look for in companies
that say we've got this mission as I

1814
01:35:35,211 --> 01:35:35,721
was mentioning,

1815
01:35:35,721 --> 01:35:38,030
but we're going to get this through
incremental steps and engaging with

1816
01:35:38,031 --> 01:35:38,900
customers along the way.

1817
01:35:38,901 --> 01:35:41,570
We're not just going to like hunker
down for 20 years and then pop out with

1818
01:35:41,571 --> 01:35:44,570
colonizing Mars and the other end
to actually paint the picture.

1819
01:35:44,571 --> 01:35:48,260
How we get from here to there,
that's even more miraculous in some ways.

1820
01:35:48,290 --> 01:35:50,450
It's like everyone can have
a big dream like, oh yeah,

1821
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:53,780
like thousands of people could
have the dreams that Elon has.

1822
01:35:54,290 --> 01:35:56,660
Almost none of them can paint a
compelling picture how to get there.

1823
01:35:58,140 --> 01:35:59,600
That's where the,
what's your 10 year vision?

1824
01:35:59,620 --> 01:36:01,290
What's your 20 year
vision comes into play?

1825
01:36:01,740 --> 01:36:05,850
So Elon has this mythical status
for so many people. I mean,

1826
01:36:05,851 --> 01:36:09,440
just this kind of superman who's
got everything figured out. Uh,

1827
01:36:09,640 --> 01:36:11,280
I found this

1828
01:36:13,110 --> 01:36:17,760
article on business insider that
was talking a little bit about your

1829
01:36:17,761 --> 01:36:22,690
relationship with him. And there are two
things. One, I'll just, uh, actually two,

1830
01:36:22,691 --> 01:36:23,510
two questions I'm gonna ask.

1831
01:36:23,510 --> 01:36:26,940
The first is called him the most
risk immune person I've ever met.

1832
01:36:28,140 --> 01:36:32,910
Uh, and then, then I have a
follow up to that. But what does,

1833
01:36:32,940 --> 01:36:37,320
what does that, what's, what's, what's
an example of him being risk immune?

1834
01:36:37,680 --> 01:36:38,140
Yeah.
I,

1835
01:36:38,140 --> 01:36:42,630
is it because he does it because he
feels differently in the face of the same

1836
01:36:42,870 --> 01:36:45,510
risk or is it because he defines
risk differently or something?

1837
01:36:45,770 --> 01:36:46,161
Yeah,

1838
01:36:46,161 --> 01:36:48,830
that's a great question because I think
it's passed through the filter of the

1839
01:36:48,831 --> 01:36:52,580
Observer. We perceive risk, incredible
risk, and some of the things he's done,

1840
01:36:52,581 --> 01:36:56,410
I don't know that we have perfect vision
on kind of how could we unreal. He does,

1841
01:36:56,420 --> 01:36:59,060
he perceive the risk the same way
we do, right. As external observers.

1842
01:36:59,510 --> 01:37:02,660
And so I think part of the answer and
his brother made it somewhat similar

1843
01:37:02,661 --> 01:37:05,420
statement once I feel comfortable
at least talking about this, uh,

1844
01:37:05,810 --> 01:37:09,800
not as if I'm speaking out of school that,
um,

1845
01:37:11,060 --> 01:37:13,040
they're like, here, here's
one I can say to externally.

1846
01:37:13,041 --> 01:37:17,600
I've never seen an entrepreneur go all
in for his companies and I say plural,

1847
01:37:17,660 --> 01:37:22,460
um, as, as Elan, like some entrepreneurial
take risks, they'll quit a job,

1848
01:37:22,461 --> 01:37:25,790
they'll spend their entire life savings
on some idea. They'll do whatever. Right?

1849
01:37:25,791 --> 01:37:27,440
The personal commitment,
personal sacrifice.

1850
01:37:27,530 --> 01:37:31,820
I've never seen anything like Ilan and
I think this story came out and where I

1851
01:37:31,821 --> 01:37:35,390
was referring back to December,
2008 yeah. This, uh, and the,

1852
01:37:35,391 --> 01:37:37,660
and the darkest period for Tesla.
Yeah.

1853
01:37:38,230 --> 01:37:41,200
So yeah, muscular. It would take 50
million to get his first trip to Mars.

1854
01:37:41,860 --> 01:37:46,300
And then next sentence, he was 200
million, 200 million in and had quit,

1855
01:37:46,301 --> 01:37:49,510
spent all of his money between that and
Tesla and he went into personal debt by

1856
01:37:49,511 --> 01:37:50,210
2008.

1857
01:37:50,210 --> 01:37:50,691
Exactly.

1858
01:37:50,691 --> 01:37:54,350
So 2008 for those that might remember
with financial crisis was happening for

1859
01:37:54,351 --> 01:37:58,270
context. At that time, Tesla had
just gotten rid of a CEO. Um,

1860
01:37:58,860 --> 01:37:59,680
Elan was not,

1861
01:37:59,680 --> 01:38:04,320
it had not been the CEO up
until then and it was tough.

1862
01:38:04,420 --> 01:38:05,640
A large investment bank,

1863
01:38:05,641 --> 01:38:07,810
one of the most prestigious had
just failed to do a fundraise.

1864
01:38:07,811 --> 01:38:09,980
This is where you hot hire them,
pay them lots of money,

1865
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:11,490
go out and get us the money.
You know,

1866
01:38:11,491 --> 01:38:14,370
you expect it to come in at the end
of this process. They're like, sorry,

1867
01:38:14,371 --> 01:38:17,550
we have nothing for you. And the company
was rapidly running out of money.

1868
01:38:17,580 --> 01:38:20,770
In fact,
it was heading towards December,

1869
01:38:20,770 --> 01:38:22,920
2008 in and they couldn't
even make payroll.

1870
01:38:22,921 --> 01:38:25,740
And so Ilan wrote a check personally
for $3 million just so they can make the

1871
01:38:25,741 --> 01:38:28,050
December,
Christmas time payroll of the employees.

1872
01:38:28,260 --> 01:38:31,200
But like January is gonna be just as
bad and there's like no money anywhere.

1873
01:38:31,220 --> 01:38:34,140
There was. And by the way, for context,
there was no government program.

1874
01:38:34,141 --> 01:38:36,210
There was no Daimler
investment at this point.

1875
01:38:36,211 --> 01:38:39,990
It was just a company that had a
roadster that was negative gross margin,

1876
01:38:40,020 --> 01:38:44,220
meaning every car you sell, you lose more
money. Um, it was a surprise discovery.

1877
01:38:44,221 --> 01:38:48,120
How bad the proposition was is when the
CEO was let go, it was like, oh my God.

1878
01:38:48,460 --> 01:38:51,960
Like contrary to our belief, we're
actually losing money on every car. Um,

1879
01:38:52,380 --> 01:38:53,940
and that's not easy to
fix. By the way, you know,

1880
01:38:53,941 --> 01:38:56,920
sell more cars does not solve
this problem right? Readily. Um,

1881
01:38:57,720 --> 01:38:59,730
and you had your largest insight investor.

1882
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:01,830
This is a term of art in
the venture community.

1883
01:39:02,130 --> 01:39:06,000
There's a lot of symbolism
when your largest investor
is or is not supportive of

1884
01:39:06,001 --> 01:39:07,190
what you're doing. It doesn't, no,

1885
01:39:07,200 --> 01:39:09,150
it doesn't mean they actually
have a thing that can, a lever,

1886
01:39:09,151 --> 01:39:10,530
they can pull that kill you are.

1887
01:39:10,530 --> 01:39:12,840
But the symbolisms bags that
are in the trenches with you,

1888
01:39:12,841 --> 01:39:14,580
and if they're refusing to write a check,

1889
01:39:14,581 --> 01:39:16,380
that's a really hard
fundraising environment.

1890
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:20,430
And the largest investor was as
hostile as I've ever seen an investor.

1891
01:39:20,431 --> 01:39:23,250
They did not want Ilana CEO. They did
not want anything do with the company.

1892
01:39:23,251 --> 01:39:27,210
They want it to pivot to a different
business strategy that seemed a little too

1893
01:39:27,211 --> 01:39:29,400
cozy, that it would support
one of their limited partners.

1894
01:39:29,401 --> 01:39:33,750
And it felt really icky. And
they were openly hostile. So, oh,

1895
01:39:33,751 --> 01:39:37,590
and he was going through a divorce and
SpaceX rockets were blowing up by the way.

1896
01:39:38,190 --> 01:39:40,590
And he spent every penny he had.
So what does he do?

1897
01:39:40,591 --> 01:39:45,570
He borrowed $20 million and
he said, okay, we don't,

1898
01:39:45,571 --> 01:39:48,180
our lead investors not here,
this large investment bank has failed.

1899
01:39:48,210 --> 01:39:51,590
I'm going to invest the $40 million
that's needed. He didn't have $49. She's,

1900
01:39:51,630 --> 01:39:53,990
I'm going to invest the $40
million is needed to hell.

1901
01:39:53,990 --> 01:39:56,190
A lot of you hear the terms and
not to help, but I'm doing it.

1902
01:39:56,220 --> 01:40:00,750
Train's leaving the station. And it
flipped this design guys, if you will,

1903
01:40:00,751 --> 01:40:03,850
from fear degreed. Right? And,
and, and this is what it is.

1904
01:40:04,250 --> 01:40:05,280
Meaning everyone's thinking,

1905
01:40:05,540 --> 01:40:08,760
I want to be part of that is he see
that I don't see. And, and to be fair,

1906
01:40:08,761 --> 01:40:11,850
there is a, um, there is a dynamic
which I'm sure you've seen,

1907
01:40:12,150 --> 01:40:14,850
which is you can have a bunch of
people around the table like we were,

1908
01:40:15,220 --> 01:40:17,340
Dfj was very enthusiastic
and wanted to invest,

1909
01:40:17,341 --> 01:40:20,640
but we can't do the full 40 million and
we need somebody to be the lead investor

1910
01:40:20,641 --> 01:40:23,400
and we'll do our full share. Right? We
actually did more than our full share,

1911
01:40:23,880 --> 01:40:27,060
but somebody's got to step further this
missing nut when your largest insider

1912
01:40:27,080 --> 01:40:29,700
won't and you don't have any outside my,
someone's got to set them up.

1913
01:40:29,700 --> 01:40:30,840
So he stepped up and said,
I don't care.

1914
01:40:30,841 --> 01:40:32,760
I'll do the whole thing
if need be who's with me?

1915
01:40:33,240 --> 01:40:35,010
And we took as much as we could.

1916
01:40:35,160 --> 01:40:38,700
We brought our growth fund in
for the first time. Um, and it,

1917
01:40:38,730 --> 01:40:42,660
it is an easier decision to say, will I
write a check, let's say for $2 million.

1918
01:40:42,690 --> 01:40:46,170
Let's say you were just one of the random
investors there as part of 40 knowing

1919
01:40:46,171 --> 01:40:49,670
that at least as 40 at least we're
going to get through this roaster cost

1920
01:40:49,671 --> 01:40:52,350
problem and, and, and be able to
turn some cards if you will. See,

1921
01:40:52,351 --> 01:40:55,110
does the government through, does the
Daimler relationship actually happened?

1922
01:40:55,111 --> 01:40:56,860
Cause there's verbal
conversations going on.

1923
01:40:57,250 --> 01:40:59,500
We'll get resolution at
least those major things.

1924
01:40:59,501 --> 01:41:02,650
And so that there'll be hope to get to
the next phase of actually building the

1925
01:41:02,651 --> 01:41:06,370
model s car. If all that falls in
our favor, let's be part of it.

1926
01:41:06,370 --> 01:41:09,370
So our $2 million check
leverages the $40 million check.

1927
01:41:09,371 --> 01:41:11,510
I'm just saying to
arbitrarily, yeah. So if you,

1928
01:41:11,511 --> 01:41:13,180
if all you can do is
write $2 million checks,

1929
01:41:13,181 --> 01:41:16,240
you would never just write it to him.
The dollar check. That's like, like a,

1930
01:41:16,300 --> 01:41:18,610
like a peer. It's not a bridge to
something. It's like, uh, you know,

1931
01:41:18,790 --> 01:41:22,630
and that's what a Elon was willing to do
in December, all by himself. And then B,

1932
01:41:22,631 --> 01:41:24,900
he was willing to do another one
all by himself. I've never seen it.

1933
01:41:24,940 --> 01:41:28,900
I get so he in retrospect
was perfectly right.

1934
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:31,860
Everything went exactly according to plan.
This is going to change the world.

1935
01:41:31,861 --> 01:41:33,610
It's going to be an
enormously valuable company.

1936
01:41:33,611 --> 01:41:37,390
This was eight an incredibly
good investment to make at
the time. In retrospect,

1937
01:41:38,020 --> 01:41:40,120
at the time it seemed like the
riskiest thing I've ever seen.

1938
01:41:40,121 --> 01:41:43,030
I've never seen an entrepreneur
fund their own company,

1939
01:41:44,380 --> 01:41:49,380
you know first when no one else would
second go net negative by $20 million.

1940
01:41:50,600 --> 01:41:54,700
Unbelievable. Did you, have you asked
him what he was thinking at the time?

1941
01:41:55,060 --> 01:41:59,380
Not Directly. I didn't
want to, I liked it.

1942
01:42:00,130 --> 01:42:00,851
This is great.

1943
01:42:00,851 --> 01:42:05,770
It just felt like the right thing is like
I could see the fear of going to greed.

1944
01:42:05,990 --> 01:42:06,670
By the way,

1945
01:42:06,670 --> 01:42:11,080
in tough times you sometimes also learn
who is going to stand by you and who

1946
01:42:11,081 --> 01:42:11,590
won't.

1947
01:42:11,590 --> 01:42:15,040
Well and so that that lead investor
and then also maybe I won't mention the

1948
01:42:15,041 --> 01:42:17,350
names, there's at least one board
member who was like, oh my gosh.

1949
01:42:17,351 --> 01:42:21,430
They showed their stripes and there's
nothing like a crisis to know if you're in

1950
01:42:21,431 --> 01:42:24,040
the trench with the right person, maybe
who you're a fair weather friends are.

1951
01:42:24,110 --> 01:42:27,430
Yeah.
To that point,

1952
01:42:28,180 --> 01:42:31,970
it's mentioned in this piece that you
don't call to you around the darkest times

1953
01:42:31,971 --> 01:42:35,020
were. And so during some of these
really tough periods, what does,

1954
01:42:35,021 --> 01:42:39,490
and it doesn't of course keeping it
whatever private should be private,

1955
01:42:39,491 --> 01:42:43,840
but what is someone like Elon and
you've interacted with a number of these

1956
01:42:43,870 --> 01:42:48,730
people who have incredible
capacity to do big things.

1957
01:42:49,470 --> 01:42:54,100
Uh, what is someone like that say to a
friend during their dark times? I mean,

1958
01:42:54,101 --> 01:42:57,640
why do they call friends?
So I'm not going to relay any specifics,

1959
01:42:57,641 --> 01:42:59,170
but I can try to get to
the gist of the question.

1960
01:42:59,171 --> 01:43:01,510
I won't really any specifics of the
phone call. And, and to be fair,

1961
01:43:01,511 --> 01:43:04,090
I don't even really remember the specifics
because I'm in so many calls over so

1962
01:43:04,091 --> 01:43:06,310
many times. So, so with
the caveat of, because,

1963
01:43:06,311 --> 01:43:09,820
because if you look at the list of
difficulties he was going through,

1964
01:43:09,821 --> 01:43:13,460
like any one of those, yeah. Be
Soul crushing, soul crushing.

1965
01:43:13,480 --> 01:43:18,130
I mean will completely paralyze and
send millions of people into a downward

1966
01:43:18,131 --> 01:43:19,540
spiral.
So it,

1967
01:43:19,541 --> 01:43:22,440
so he has said some things cause I don't
want to speak out of school but there

1968
01:43:22,441 --> 01:43:23,920
is something I can share
that might be helpful.

1969
01:43:24,100 --> 01:43:27,700
He has spoken himself and it was like
eating glass that this was like really

1970
01:43:27,701 --> 01:43:29,740
terrible time.
So he's made some comments personally,

1971
01:43:29,741 --> 01:43:32,230
I'll just let him speak for
what it felt like for him.

1972
01:43:32,830 --> 01:43:36,310
But I would say that what I've observed
in that crisis and other crises that we

1973
01:43:36,311 --> 01:43:41,311
generalize is that he goes into a
battle mode of focus that is really

1974
01:43:41,831 --> 01:43:43,080
remarkable.
Um,

1975
01:43:43,480 --> 01:43:47,050
in this battle mode is allows him I
think to ignore distraction and to have a

1976
01:43:47,051 --> 01:43:49,650
laser focus on what needs
to get done. So, um,

1977
01:43:49,930 --> 01:43:54,930
it'll sometimes be observant as these
sort of thoughtful deep moments of like,

1978
01:43:55,190 --> 01:43:58,370
wow. Like you see it on his face and, and
you, you want to give him space to think.

1979
01:43:58,371 --> 01:44:00,710
Cause I think there's like four people
that can be times when your generative

1980
01:44:00,770 --> 01:44:04,520
and thoughtful and brainstorming and
thinking about all possibilities and the

1981
01:44:04,521 --> 01:44:06,170
wonder of the world.
And other times when you're like,

1982
01:44:06,320 --> 01:44:09,350
you've got to like solve the problem and
like focus in, in, in, in those modes,

1983
01:44:10,010 --> 01:44:12,860
he can avoid distraction
like no one else I've seen.

1984
01:44:12,861 --> 01:44:17,420
So a lot of the smart CEOs and
entrepreneurs I've worked with are,

1985
01:44:17,740 --> 01:44:20,210
are some of them share
afterwards that I have in spades,

1986
01:44:20,211 --> 01:44:21,680
which is I'm interested in many things.

1987
01:44:21,681 --> 01:44:25,880
I'm easily distracted by something and
sometimes I'd rather avoid the tough

1988
01:44:25,910 --> 01:44:27,590
crisis in my,
you know,

1989
01:44:27,591 --> 01:44:30,710
in thinking about it when
there's something more fun
to spend time on. Right.

1990
01:44:30,711 --> 01:44:34,330
And so I'm almost the opposite of this
exist to give credit to how valuable this

1991
01:44:34,331 --> 01:44:38,630
says. Um, when, let's say Tesla has faced
various, um, manufacturing challenges,

1992
01:44:38,631 --> 01:44:41,120
these sort of production hell
times that he's described.

1993
01:44:41,420 --> 01:44:45,260
He physically sets up his office on the
production floor in a very visible area

1994
01:44:45,261 --> 01:44:45,980
with no walls.

1995
01:44:45,980 --> 01:44:49,190
So everyone can see that he's there
through the weekend and I'm the vice

1996
01:44:49,191 --> 01:44:52,760
presidency that and that ripples out.
Um, when he's calling a supplier,

1997
01:44:52,761 --> 01:44:55,540
let's say he was often the cause of
a problem is like Angela, like, well,

1998
01:44:55,541 --> 01:44:57,310
I'm here in the factory.
Where were you going?

1999
01:44:57,410 --> 01:45:00,470
Why aren't you here solving this word? I
said, yeah, it has a lot of impact, right?

2000
01:45:00,500 --> 01:45:04,070
That personal attention to right now,

2001
01:45:04,370 --> 01:45:07,400
everything else needs to be gone.
I'd have to solve this problem.

2002
01:45:07,430 --> 01:45:11,690
I witnessed this for example, uh,
in a, in a, in a more subtle way,

2003
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:16,040
more recently when I was setting up
or trying to set up rather a very

2004
01:45:16,041 --> 01:45:18,920
interesting phone call between the
Marzano persons or the Mars exploration

2005
01:45:18,921 --> 01:45:20,290
program for NASA,
uh,

2006
01:45:20,330 --> 01:45:24,110
Craig Vendor who's a pioneer and study
biology and gene sequencing and gene

2007
01:45:24,111 --> 01:45:27,300
synthesis. And I want to just getting
along on a half hour call because we,

2008
01:45:27,320 --> 01:45:31,500
the sort of idea had occurred amongst us
that we could do a much cheaper Marzia

2009
01:45:31,510 --> 01:45:35,180
turned mission. In other words,
fine. If there's any life
on Mars, either, you know,

2010
01:45:35,240 --> 01:45:37,310
um,
archaic or currently living,

2011
01:45:37,580 --> 01:45:40,850
the best way to explore it would
be not to send it back from Mars,

2012
01:45:40,851 --> 01:45:41,601
which is very difficult.

2013
01:45:41,601 --> 01:45:45,620
But the Senate gene sequencer to Mars
sequence a locally beam the data back and

2014
01:45:45,621 --> 01:45:48,140
create the living organism on earth.
That's actually is doable.

2015
01:45:48,560 --> 01:45:50,810
And I thought Elan's should
certainly be inserted in this cause.

2016
01:45:50,811 --> 01:45:53,000
I'm like the next phase of
Mars exploration, terraforming,

2017
01:45:53,001 --> 01:45:55,190
finding out what organisms
do live on Mars or not.

2018
01:45:55,460 --> 01:45:58,700
If they mutate and margin actually
start thriving, send the data back,

2019
01:45:58,701 --> 01:46:01,760
create a version on earth to study, adhere
and more rapidly telephone terraform,

2020
01:46:01,761 --> 01:46:04,940
Mars. He's like, you know,
that's great. He said,

2021
01:46:05,570 --> 01:46:07,970
I can't take that from only
half hour phone call one day.

2022
01:46:07,971 --> 01:46:09,970
That will be important right now.
I get it, get it fucking heavy.

2023
01:46:09,971 --> 01:46:14,210
They fly or they won't be that need
for me to be doing that. So I'm like,

2024
01:46:14,211 --> 01:46:16,430
I would love this half hour phone
call with you once the three of them,

2025
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:19,820
he's like that. That can wait a few
years and it can, right. Yeah. Um,

2026
01:46:20,120 --> 01:46:23,330
and that remarkable ability to push
aside all these interesting things when

2027
01:46:23,331 --> 01:46:27,330
there's, I got to get Xyz to
ship or fix the problem. Um,

2028
01:46:27,410 --> 01:46:30,860
and so fixing the gross margin
problem back in 2008 getting a CEO,

2029
01:46:30,890 --> 01:46:31,910
which didn't have to be himself,

2030
01:46:32,090 --> 01:46:37,090
I'm in place and solving on all the
myriad problems that were in place was

2031
01:46:37,521 --> 01:46:41,570
battle mode. And he would also lean on
confidence and friends. So it'd be fair.

2032
01:46:41,571 --> 01:46:42,910
There were others like Antonio Grassy,

2033
01:46:42,911 --> 01:46:46,310
us and others who really rolled up their
sleeves got on the factory floor and

2034
01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:50,440
close friend. Yeah, he's, he's
amazing. So folks that um,

2035
01:46:50,610 --> 01:46:51,910
really come and,
you know,

2036
01:46:52,030 --> 01:46:54,810
prove that there was some little stable
investors out there, Antonio's happy to,

2037
01:46:54,880 --> 01:46:57,460
to, to fight to support his
friends too. Oh, exactly.

2038
01:46:58,470 --> 01:47:01,380
I'll just say he's my favorite investor
I've ever met in my entire network,

2039
01:47:02,070 --> 01:47:06,570
so I mean get up more over, over
a bottle of wine about this. But,

2040
01:47:06,780 --> 01:47:09,900
so we were, Antonia and I were in
the Henry Crown Fellowship program.

2041
01:47:09,901 --> 01:47:11,110
The other thing that's been institutes,
we,

2042
01:47:11,170 --> 01:47:14,880
we've had a chest spent a lot of time
together. Um, yeah, great guy. Absolutely.

2043
01:47:14,881 --> 01:47:17,820
Great Guy. Said two things
come to mind. The first is,

2044
01:47:18,750 --> 01:47:20,290
and I'm sure I'm going to butcher this,
but I,

2045
01:47:20,370 --> 01:47:22,230
I hate to quote attributed to Steve Jobs.

2046
01:47:22,231 --> 01:47:24,950
I feel like there are a
lot of mistreated quotes.

2047
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:26,130
I'm pretty sure this is accurate.

2048
01:47:26,190 --> 01:47:29,070
I don't think it's enabling
can situations on the Internet,

2049
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:33,090
but that innovation is saying no
to a thousand things that the,

2050
01:47:33,360 --> 01:47:36,140
I haven't heard that
button but in any case, uh,

2051
01:47:36,210 --> 01:47:39,630
the other was he's also by the way jobs
was very proud of and that's what his

2052
01:47:39,631 --> 01:47:41,700
greatest creation or grades
contribution to the world.

2053
01:47:41,780 --> 01:47:46,200
Greatest invention as great. It's
thing on his death, but it was apple,

2054
01:47:46,260 --> 01:47:50,760
the organization and it was really the
process learning coming back to something,

2055
01:47:50,761 --> 01:47:51,720
I was starting to have it earlier.

2056
01:47:52,050 --> 01:47:54,990
He was focused on physical space design
and keeping the engineer's in the

2057
01:47:54,991 --> 01:47:57,150
marketing people thinking about
where the bathrooms aren't Pixar,

2058
01:47:57,151 --> 01:47:58,980
so you have to walk by
certain areas to get to them.

2059
01:47:59,490 --> 01:48:03,210
He was maniacal about architecting
the way people communicate,

2060
01:48:03,211 --> 01:48:05,010
kicking people out of
meetings at the too big.

2061
01:48:05,011 --> 01:48:08,260
So he had an intuitive sense about
team size along before I did.

2062
01:48:08,261 --> 01:48:12,680
And now I know that people are over a
certain weight class or you don't want

2063
01:48:13,500 --> 01:48:15,840
people on anything productive.
No development team.

2064
01:48:15,841 --> 01:48:19,380
Actually five the ideal number five
plus or minus two boards of directors,

2065
01:48:19,530 --> 01:48:21,540
development teams,
creative groups.

2066
01:48:22,020 --> 01:48:24,270
That's the one of the secret of managers
of small companies that they have less

2067
01:48:24,271 --> 01:48:26,580
people and they get shit
done when it's a big company,

2068
01:48:26,581 --> 01:48:29,740
has hundreds of people and sclerotic
layers of management that Dave lost the

2069
01:48:29,741 --> 01:48:34,020
small team dynamic.
So I always like to ask about,

2070
01:48:34,040 --> 01:48:36,990
I asked about it with Elan, uh, the,

2071
01:48:36,991 --> 01:48:39,810
some of the tougher times because
more challenges because it's,

2072
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:42,900
it's easy I think.
And I explore this with uh,

2073
01:48:43,050 --> 01:48:47,290
lots of everybody who's on the show.
I tried to ask her about how they are,

2074
01:48:47,490 --> 01:48:50,730
how they try to deal with overwhelm or
if they feel scattered, what do they do?

2075
01:48:51,210 --> 01:48:55,060
And uh, it was, we talked a little
about, a little bit about Elan,

2076
01:48:55,080 --> 01:48:58,500
I'd love to ask you,
because you recently had an experience in,

2077
01:48:58,501 --> 01:49:01,470
a lot of people have in the sense that I,

2078
01:49:01,471 --> 01:49:05,400
and many others get their turn as
kind of the, uh, the punching bag.

2079
01:49:05,700 --> 01:49:06,720
If you're public facing,
I mean,

2080
01:49:06,721 --> 01:49:10,710
you're going to run into things and you
had an experience recently that I'd love

2081
01:49:10,711 --> 01:49:13,170
for you to describe if you're open to it.

2082
01:49:13,590 --> 01:49:18,450
And then I have some follow up questions
just about how you then reacted to it,

2083
01:49:18,510 --> 01:49:20,860
right. Self talk and things
like that. So maybe, uh, if,

2084
01:49:20,861 --> 01:49:24,810
if I could just leave it open. So, uh,
yeah, maybe it's an elephant in the room,

2085
01:49:24,811 --> 01:49:29,550
but in the last couple months I have
faced the most surreal experience of my

2086
01:49:29,551 --> 01:49:31,040
career, which is, you know, what's,

2087
01:49:31,041 --> 01:49:35,220
I'm 23 years of venture capital in
many before that all positive press

2088
01:49:35,221 --> 01:49:38,400
experiences.
And then I faced a bizarre,

2089
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:42,210
so almost auto catalytic,
you know,

2090
01:49:42,240 --> 01:49:47,230
self-generating theme that I hosted
a sex party with my fancy, um,

2091
01:49:47,470 --> 01:49:51,070
in silicon valley. And at first I laughed.
Oh, there's a hilarious, you know,

2092
01:49:51,071 --> 01:49:52,180
as an ex geek,
you know,

2093
01:49:52,181 --> 01:49:55,360
growing up my whole life with
glasses and braces and what have you,

2094
01:49:55,361 --> 01:49:58,120
like the notion, I mean, my first
date was in college and you're like,

2095
01:49:58,150 --> 01:50:00,220
I really thought that
was hilarious at first.

2096
01:50:00,221 --> 01:50:04,000
And then it got a little more serious. I'm
like, wait, this, this is ridiculous. Um,

2097
01:50:04,590 --> 01:50:07,930
and, and it really, the thing
that's even when it came,

2098
01:50:07,960 --> 01:50:12,520
it derived from a book that came out
in February where there's no such claim

2099
01:50:12,521 --> 01:50:15,370
that we hosted a sex party but it's in
a chapter about sex parties that other

2100
01:50:15,371 --> 01:50:16,204
people had.

2101
01:50:16,240 --> 01:50:19,390
And we just happened to be the only party
that has been anyone mentioned by name.

2102
01:50:19,391 --> 01:50:20,400
And then it,

2103
01:50:20,401 --> 01:50:23,710
I mean if I tried to put a simplistic
spin on this or try to make sense of it,

2104
01:50:24,040 --> 01:50:26,530
it looks like people just didn't read
the chapter very carefully and they wait

2105
01:50:26,531 --> 01:50:31,240
blog posts or other like very sort of
nonprofessional postings online that oh my

2106
01:50:31,241 --> 01:50:33,760
gosh, the sex party who was at
Steve's house. And I'm like,

2107
01:50:33,761 --> 01:50:37,990
well what she not only did the
book not say that it wasn't true.

2108
01:50:38,350 --> 01:50:39,101
And by the way,

2109
01:50:39,101 --> 01:50:43,240
there's 150 people that attended this
thing that no one's not true and like 10

2110
01:50:43,241 --> 01:50:44,230
of them go publicly on,

2111
01:50:44,231 --> 01:50:46,990
which is kind of a risky thing to do is
say I was at this party and there was no

2112
01:50:46,991 --> 01:50:49,330
sex. Like including Ilan
and I, Elon Musk is like,

2113
01:50:49,331 --> 01:50:51,490
this is irresponsible journalism.
Or something to that effect.

2114
01:50:51,491 --> 01:50:53,490
And he condemned the writer and like,
like,

2115
01:50:54,120 --> 01:50:58,960
and it's kind of bizarre because I know
this author, I've been on her, you know,

2116
01:50:58,990 --> 01:51:01,690
Bloomberg television program many times.
She knows my email,

2117
01:51:01,691 --> 01:51:04,360
she knows my cell phone.
She never called me for a fact check,

2118
01:51:04,600 --> 01:51:07,100
which I didn't realize in
book publishing today, uh,

2119
01:51:07,150 --> 01:51:10,630
in what's ostensibly a nonfiction
category that the publishers do.

2120
01:51:10,631 --> 01:51:11,371
No fact checking.

2121
01:51:11,371 --> 01:51:15,520
And that's just a fact
now it's transformed from
decades ago and they leave it

2122
01:51:15,521 --> 01:51:19,900
up to the writer and the writer just blue
just didn't even try to see how it was

2123
01:51:19,901 --> 01:51:24,901
true and more disturbingly would retweet
even though she never said we had a sex

2124
01:51:25,241 --> 01:51:28,590
party. She would retweet other
people who did. So some, you know,

2125
01:51:28,690 --> 01:51:31,840
other publication in Europe would
say, oh the, the orgy, right?

2126
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:36,520
So it starts to grow the orgy at our house
and she retweets it really, you know,

2127
01:51:36,521 --> 01:51:38,680
this isn't true.
And I know she knows it isn't true,

2128
01:51:38,860 --> 01:51:40,960
but she keeps re tweeting it
because it sells more books.

2129
01:51:41,500 --> 01:51:43,030
And I know executives for example,

2130
01:51:43,031 --> 01:51:46,600
who've been pressured by their PR people
to say positive things about the book

2131
01:51:47,080 --> 01:51:49,550
because of her ongoing role
is a Bloomberg reporter.

2132
01:51:49,551 --> 01:51:53,770
So you have this weird conflict of
interest when you want to sell books and

2133
01:51:53,771 --> 01:51:57,190
salacious stories sell to propagate
something that's not true.

2134
01:51:57,191 --> 01:52:01,300
Even if you didn't say it yourself and
then turn around and use your leverage

2135
01:52:01,360 --> 01:52:05,350
and your bully pulpit on Twitter and
elsewhere to gain support for your book.

2136
01:52:05,351 --> 01:52:06,184
Because you know,

2137
01:52:06,190 --> 01:52:09,190
people want to continue working with you
and you're going to be the journalist

2138
01:52:09,191 --> 01:52:11,740
of record in the tech industry at one
of the biggest news organizations.

2139
01:52:11,740 --> 01:52:15,550
It's kind of unfair. Feels
really horrible. Yeah.

2140
01:52:15,551 --> 01:52:17,020
Well I was going to ask
you like how did it,

2141
01:52:17,080 --> 01:52:21,100
how did it feel and what was your
self talk may be in the short term.

2142
01:52:21,101 --> 01:52:26,070
And then I ask a lot of people about
self-talk, uh, which I'm fascinated by it,

2143
01:52:26,071 --> 01:52:27,940
right?
So sort of the day of,

2144
01:52:27,970 --> 01:52:32,620
let's just say when it ceases
to be funny and then maybe,

2145
01:52:33,580 --> 01:52:35,170
I don't know,
I'm making this up in terms of timeline,

2146
01:52:35,171 --> 01:52:37,660
but like a few days later when you've had
a chance to maybe gather your thoughts

2147
01:52:37,661 --> 01:52:42,320
a bit. Yeah. So despite the initial
burst, almost like a defensive Aha,

2148
01:52:42,340 --> 01:52:44,800
this is funny, you know, and then
when I really allowed it to sink,

2149
01:52:45,030 --> 01:52:47,540
they probably took some number of hours.
I'm like, wait a minute, this, you know,

2150
01:52:47,541 --> 01:52:48,980
like for example,
the 150,

2151
01:52:49,550 --> 01:52:52,750
probably more until about 150 that really
knew there was nothing there and they

2152
01:52:52,751 --> 01:52:53,370
were there the whole time.

2153
01:52:53,370 --> 01:52:55,400
They had to explain to their
spouses and others are like, no,

2154
01:52:55,401 --> 01:52:58,760
I really wasn't at a sex
party. It's really embarrassing
when those poor people,

2155
01:52:59,150 --> 01:53:03,070
totally innocent. Um, anyway, and again,
not to condemn a sex party. I mean,

2156
01:53:03,710 --> 01:53:05,450
and there've been invited to one,
I'd never held one.

2157
01:53:05,480 --> 01:53:08,630
I don't want to say it's a terrible thing.
I'll just say I haven't been the one,

2158
01:53:08,631 --> 01:53:09,860
I don't want to be accused of one.
Right.

2159
01:53:09,890 --> 01:53:12,620
Well just as to inject
some levity real quickly.

2160
01:53:12,621 --> 01:53:16,820
So I just moved to San Francisco,
this was a long time ago. And uh,

2161
01:53:16,821 --> 01:53:18,980
one of my neighbors said, oh,
welcome to the neighborhood.

2162
01:53:18,981 --> 01:53:21,590
You should come over Saturday like
we're having a party. I was like, sure,

2163
01:53:21,620 --> 01:53:25,460
no problem. So, uh, I ended up like
having a late dinner. I'm like, okay,

2164
01:53:25,461 --> 01:53:28,730
it's too late. No, it's not too late.
Come on over. So I walk in and I'm like,

2165
01:53:29,540 --> 01:53:30,620
what's happening here?

2166
01:53:30,620 --> 01:53:35,620
Like people in various states of
undress and a just in time to realize,

2167
01:53:37,190 --> 01:53:40,040
oh my God, I'm actually at a sex
bar. Like there's food served,

2168
01:53:40,460 --> 01:53:43,910
but I'm like fully clothed with a
beanie and a and a and a Hoodie on.

2169
01:53:44,180 --> 01:53:44,811
And then they go,
okay,

2170
01:53:44,811 --> 01:53:46,940
everybody sit down and we're going
to do a round of introductions.

2171
01:53:46,970 --> 01:53:50,600
And so I sit down and like, wait, how do
I get out of this? Cause they're like 40,

2172
01:53:50,601 --> 01:53:52,400
50 people there.
And a,

2173
01:53:52,401 --> 01:53:56,120
I did manage to scurry out and then
then say to my neighbor, uh, wow,

2174
01:53:56,121 --> 01:53:59,600
I won't name by name, but I was just
like, please in the future, let me know,

2175
01:54:00,590 --> 01:54:02,900
give me a heads up like,
and I have nothing against it,

2176
01:54:02,901 --> 01:54:05,660
but it's like let me know
what's going on in any case.

2177
01:54:05,680 --> 01:54:08,090
So that's like you're in the
bay area, right? So it's like,

2178
01:54:08,810 --> 01:54:13,100
I'm sure these things happen. I literally
invited to one. It's not my thing. So, um,

2179
01:54:13,101 --> 01:54:15,140
so I don't want to sound too
preachy because you know,

2180
01:54:15,380 --> 01:54:16,220
but it's just not my thing.

2181
01:54:16,221 --> 01:54:20,240
And it does feel weird to have a room
full of tech executives and some of our

2182
01:54:20,241 --> 01:54:25,010
closest business colleagues, scores of
them, um, maligned in this indirect way.

2183
01:54:25,220 --> 01:54:26,053
So,
um,

2184
01:54:26,270 --> 01:54:31,270
the way I felt though is I felt
really betrayed and there were,

2185
01:54:31,281 --> 01:54:34,790
and it wasn't just a single journalists
that I've highlighted, like, wow,

2186
01:54:35,180 --> 01:54:37,140
what happened to professional
journalistic ethics?

2187
01:54:37,141 --> 01:54:39,830
It's like just fact checking
and caring about the truth.

2188
01:54:40,070 --> 01:54:44,150
That's one branch of disappointment. The
other was, um, a little more invisible.

2189
01:54:44,151 --> 01:54:45,260
I'll keep this anonymous,

2190
01:54:45,261 --> 01:54:48,800
but there were a number of people I
noticed who would immediately lend support

2191
01:54:48,801 --> 01:54:52,130
to this idea online.
Like either simple things like you know,

2192
01:54:52,180 --> 01:54:54,380
retweeting something without
checking with me. You know,

2193
01:54:54,381 --> 01:54:57,680
people who extensively know me.
Um, that was really disappointing.

2194
01:54:57,681 --> 01:55:00,590
So I felt betrayed by
luckily only a handful.

2195
01:55:00,650 --> 01:55:03,350
I mean a remarkably small
number of people who just,

2196
01:55:03,380 --> 01:55:06,160
and frankly there was somebody
at least well known context.

2197
01:55:06,161 --> 01:55:08,200
So these aren't close personal
friends that are like mid state,

2198
01:55:08,201 --> 01:55:10,070
other venture capitalists lists.
I just as a category,

2199
01:55:10,260 --> 01:55:14,570
you know on the other side I was blown
away by the outpouring of support by

2200
01:55:14,571 --> 01:55:17,150
people who do know me. So
a couple of um, you know,

2201
01:55:17,390 --> 01:55:21,200
coworkers of ex employees that I used
to work with came out with blog posts.

2202
01:55:21,310 --> 01:55:25,430
And in every case it was
after they published that I
even knew they were putting

2203
01:55:25,431 --> 01:55:27,050
something together and
coming in my defense,

2204
01:55:27,080 --> 01:55:30,320
it's like a female entrepreneurs
of all types. You're like, no,

2205
01:55:30,321 --> 01:55:34,460
it was anything but this happened at this
event and we'll be eternally grateful

2206
01:55:34,490 --> 01:55:36,410
for again, when, when
time is really tough,

2207
01:55:36,420 --> 01:55:40,730
you find out a bit more about people's
character and you find out who is really

2208
01:55:40,850 --> 01:55:45,840
someone who knows. You get somebody who
knows me knows is not true. Right. And uh,

2209
01:55:45,930 --> 01:55:48,360
what's weird is that I thought
that'd be obvious for larger set,

2210
01:55:48,420 --> 01:55:51,690
but at least the ones who really know me,
they don't even need to ask about it.

2211
01:55:52,530 --> 01:55:54,570
Oh my God, dude, what's
going on? This is crazy.

2212
01:55:56,710 --> 01:56:00,760
What prevented you,
I mean you had the outpouring of support.

2213
01:56:00,820 --> 01:56:03,850
You also had a few people
show their true colors.

2214
01:56:04,810 --> 01:56:07,840
Some people when they get hit with
something like that, anything,

2215
01:56:07,841 --> 01:56:10,630
I mean I've had periods where it's like,

2216
01:56:10,631 --> 01:56:13,410
I remember this kind of hit
piece came out on me. Uh,

2217
01:56:13,560 --> 01:56:14,770
and I'm not saying these
are the same thing,

2218
01:56:14,771 --> 01:56:18,820
but like it's hippies came out on me and
it came out on my birthday at one point

2219
01:56:18,821 --> 01:56:19,180
where I have it,

2220
01:56:19,180 --> 01:56:22,540
I have this annual gathering of my closest
friends and it was through a credible,

2221
01:56:22,541 --> 01:56:27,541
I mean a very well known publication that
had not only they had contacted me for

2222
01:56:27,761 --> 01:56:28,960
fact checking via phone,

2223
01:56:29,230 --> 01:56:32,950
I had corrected a bunch of misquotes and
then they ran it as is without making

2224
01:56:32,951 --> 01:56:37,951
any of the changes and it really bummed
me out like I was considering not doing

2225
01:56:39,341 --> 01:56:40,960
any interviews ever in the future.

2226
01:56:41,260 --> 01:56:44,740
Maybe I'll have to make a
number of changes to my life
so that I'm not a exposed

2227
01:56:44,741 --> 01:56:48,010
and I think that there are certain ways
you can mitigate like always doing fact

2228
01:56:48,011 --> 01:56:51,850
checking email, email responses as
opposed to be a thousand. They can't deny.

2229
01:56:51,851 --> 01:56:53,620
You always direct it to email.

2230
01:56:53,621 --> 01:56:56,980
I mean there are a number of different
ways that you can risk mitigate there, but

2231
01:56:59,920 --> 01:57:00,341
was there,

2232
01:57:00,341 --> 01:57:03,430
was there anything that you said to
yourself or the other people said to you

2233
01:57:03,460 --> 01:57:05,380
that was particularly helpful at the time?

2234
01:57:08,620 --> 01:57:12,750
Let me think about that
for a second. Um, well the,

2235
01:57:13,030 --> 01:57:15,760
the thing that jumps to mind is how
supportive my fiance Genevieve was

2236
01:57:15,761 --> 01:57:16,451
throughout this.
I mean,

2237
01:57:16,451 --> 01:57:20,740
she's a fighter and she was at my side
throughout in some ways it was incredible.

2238
01:57:20,770 --> 01:57:23,530
Um, and I'm incredibly thankful
for her support throughout.

2239
01:57:23,531 --> 01:57:26,860
This is the beginning
of what you were saying.

2240
01:57:27,280 --> 01:57:30,670
The part that it was going through my
mind as you were asking the question is

2241
01:57:30,671 --> 01:57:34,870
that one of the toughest things in it
relates to advice other people gave me was

2242
01:57:34,871 --> 01:57:36,220
the advice to not say anything.

2243
01:57:37,090 --> 01:57:40,540
The advice to be just mum.

2244
01:57:40,570 --> 01:57:42,880
I got advice from people who focus on PR.

2245
01:57:42,881 --> 01:57:45,550
I got advice from people who've been
through similar situations or worse,

2246
01:57:45,551 --> 01:57:48,990
I've been accused of crazy
things or like crimes, right?

2247
01:57:49,480 --> 01:57:53,700
Falsely accused of crimes. Uh, which
luckily I've never been accused of. Um,

2248
01:57:54,490 --> 01:57:59,490
and in every single case
like with like zero crack of,

2249
01:58:00,370 --> 01:58:03,190
there's another side to this point
of view is like you say, nothing,

2250
01:58:03,790 --> 01:58:07,960
you do not point out the obvious flaws in
these false accusations. In the, in the,

2251
01:58:07,961 --> 01:58:08,291
in the,

2252
01:58:08,291 --> 01:58:12,880
in the research supporting this is
disturbing but true that anything you say

2253
01:58:12,910 --> 01:58:17,910
even definitively proving your innocence
will only worsen people's perception of

2254
01:58:18,731 --> 01:58:19,564
you at large.

2255
01:58:19,840 --> 01:58:24,840
Just the mere recanting or resurfacing
of that topic to then say it has been

2256
01:58:25,631 --> 01:58:26,890
decidedly proven false.

2257
01:58:27,280 --> 01:58:30,370
It will make people think worse of
you on average now from from media

2258
01:58:30,371 --> 01:58:33,190
perspective. So in private
conversations that that's not the case.

2259
01:58:33,430 --> 01:58:34,630
And I've asked psychologists about this,

2260
01:58:34,631 --> 01:58:39,631
I don't know all of the studies like real
clinical slash science driven studies

2261
01:58:39,901 --> 01:58:42,790
show that you do not to say anything.
Even the prove your own essence.

2262
01:58:42,791 --> 01:58:45,790
So that's horrible,
right?

2263
01:58:45,791 --> 01:58:49,030
It's like that's where you're torn up
with all the virtual conversations you'd

2264
01:58:49,031 --> 01:58:52,690
like to have with the people who've
done you wrong with the media.

2265
01:58:52,810 --> 01:58:54,610
It cause you know,
you can set the record straight.

2266
01:58:54,611 --> 01:58:58,270
It's like I wrote pages of
stuff that I never used.

2267
01:58:58,570 --> 01:59:01,050
Like well let's just set the
record straight like I can I,

2268
01:59:01,130 --> 01:59:04,750
my mind played for months. It
would play through, you know? Well,

2269
01:59:04,810 --> 01:59:08,440
here's what I would say that with
just either a, clear it all up or B,

2270
01:59:08,590 --> 01:59:11,680
get back at the person who I know is
being dishonest to prove they're being

2271
01:59:11,681 --> 01:59:15,560
dishonest right now. Fess up
like you own this one. Yeah.

2272
01:59:16,010 --> 01:59:17,830
So that is the most difficult.

2273
01:59:17,860 --> 01:59:20,690
I really had a hard time with
that because in every ad,

2274
01:59:20,691 --> 01:59:22,120
that aspect of my life
I don't have to do that.

2275
01:59:22,840 --> 01:59:25,600
You can speak openly about
like I disagree with you.

2276
01:59:25,601 --> 01:59:28,720
Well that didn't really happen or
that's a science based fact, you know,

2277
01:59:28,721 --> 01:59:32,920
or something like x scientist. I hate
that. It's so it seems like this,

2278
01:59:33,250 --> 01:59:38,250
I mean you were able to
withstand the flak very well.

2279
01:59:38,680 --> 01:59:42,790
If you think back on,
it could be at any point in your life,

2280
01:59:42,791 --> 01:59:46,490
but has there ever been a particularly
difficult period for you? I mean,

2281
01:59:46,540 --> 01:59:51,250
and that you know,
I mean my whole high school I could say,

2282
01:59:51,251 --> 01:59:55,570
but that was a long retracted series of
pain of just feeling insecure and like

2283
01:59:56,110 --> 01:59:58,540
that was a late bloomer. I mean, they
sort of, I can tell you about tough times,

2284
01:59:58,541 --> 02:00:01,390
but there wasn't like a shock to the
system and it wasn't like, I mean,

2285
02:00:01,500 --> 02:00:05,620
I was deeply hurt when my dad
died. I mean that, that was tough,

2286
02:00:05,621 --> 02:00:10,220
but it was something that's, that's
life. It was a natural cause, you know,

2287
02:00:10,630 --> 02:00:12,880
I'm not Paul Funds, so it was tough. Yeah.

2288
02:00:12,910 --> 02:00:15,940
I mean I remorse and so I've
gone through some tough things,

2289
02:00:15,941 --> 02:00:18,940
but nothing that was quite
like this, which is, yeah. Wow.

2290
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:23,180
That really someone did me wrong. Yeah.
I had been betrayed as opposed to, yeah.

2291
02:00:23,470 --> 02:00:23,770
You know,

2292
02:00:23,770 --> 02:00:28,540
life has its cycles and I can feel sad
about the passing of a dear loved one,

2293
02:00:28,541 --> 02:00:32,200
but it's a different category I think.
Yeah. No, totally different categories.

2294
02:00:32,201 --> 02:00:36,120
But the, I'm interested still
in the coping mechanisms or the,

2295
02:00:36,200 --> 02:00:40,120
the thinking that goes with it.
So when your dad died, uh, no,

2296
02:00:40,300 --> 02:00:43,510
I'm sorry for your loss. Um,
and it's hard for me to imagine,

2297
02:00:43,960 --> 02:00:48,960
but what was most helpful
during the period of grieving
or recovering from that?

2298
02:00:52,390 --> 02:00:53,230
It wasn't,

2299
02:00:53,620 --> 02:00:58,000
I didn't have a playbook of what
to do and what seemed most natural,

2300
02:00:58,001 --> 02:01:01,180
and it may have been the habit of mind,
was to focus on my mom and helping her.

2301
02:01:01,310 --> 02:01:04,700
Yeah. Uh, who survived him, who was
there. I decided when he passed, um,

2302
02:01:05,680 --> 02:01:09,010
of a heart attack. Um, it's just
one of those things where like,

2303
02:01:09,011 --> 02:01:10,840
why you're trying to revive him,
you're trying to call nine one one for,

2304
02:01:10,841 --> 02:01:11,500
I was like,
oh,

2305
02:01:11,500 --> 02:01:15,460
my heart went out so much to her and how
her situation was worse than mine in a

2306
02:01:15,461 --> 02:01:18,790
way that that consumed almost all my
thoughts for some period of time dealing

2307
02:01:18,791 --> 02:01:19,624
with,
you know,

2308
02:01:19,870 --> 02:01:23,080
I'm the only child in that family
dealing with what needs to be dealt with.

2309
02:01:23,130 --> 02:01:23,590
They just,

2310
02:01:23,590 --> 02:01:28,590
I want it to sort of almost nonemotional
operations mode and may have been

2311
02:01:29,380 --> 02:01:32,510
sometime late that night or the
next day that I finally was.

2312
02:01:32,520 --> 02:01:37,120
I allowed myself to cry, um,
and really face what I had lost.

2313
02:01:37,840 --> 02:01:42,840
Part of what gave incredible solace is
perhaps some wisdom I could pass on to

2314
02:01:42,981 --> 02:01:47,480
others who worry about parents who go
and I know Tim urban and others have

2315
02:01:47,481 --> 02:01:49,670
written some wonderful pieces about,
you know, thinking about your parents,

2316
02:01:49,671 --> 02:01:51,050
if you have anyone near
our parents' generation,

2317
02:01:51,051 --> 02:01:54,110
like how many days do you have left
with them yesterday? The tail end? Yes.

2318
02:01:54,140 --> 02:01:55,730
Everybody should read it.
Absolutely.

2319
02:01:55,731 --> 02:01:58,490
It was recommended to me just as a
quick side note by Matt Mullenweg,

2320
02:01:58,760 --> 02:02:00,220
mutual friend,
favorite people,

2321
02:02:00,260 --> 02:02:05,260
wonderful person who also lost his father
not too long ago and he recommended it

2322
02:02:05,811 --> 02:02:07,700
to me before it happened.
Exactly.

2323
02:02:07,880 --> 02:02:11,840
So maybe the thing that I took
solace in that I'll share for others,

2324
02:02:12,800 --> 02:02:15,790
it's not what you do and the
weeks before someone passes,

2325
02:02:15,791 --> 02:02:18,590
it really defines your relationship. It's
what you've done over your, your life.

2326
02:02:18,860 --> 02:02:21,650
And so I had been going to the Ted
Conference. I brought him with me.

2327
02:02:21,651 --> 02:02:24,620
It was just one of the greatest
joys of his life for years prior.

2328
02:02:24,690 --> 02:02:26,330
The fact that we had all
those weeks together,

2329
02:02:26,331 --> 02:02:30,050
sort of these one on one
times of intellectual pursuits
in this in a way almost

2330
02:02:30,051 --> 02:02:31,160
a welcome into my world.

2331
02:02:31,670 --> 02:02:36,080
Like take dad to workday in a sense in
this sort of sort of virtual world of

2332
02:02:36,081 --> 02:02:40,000
like ideas and science technology.
Um, when he, he went through his, uh,

2333
02:02:40,040 --> 02:02:43,990
he went through a pancreatic
surgery procedure and uh, uh, uh,

2334
02:02:44,210 --> 02:02:47,450
just around Thanksgiving
and came out of it.

2335
02:02:47,480 --> 02:02:50,620
And then I was told by the nurse who
first saw him when he came out of it.

2336
02:02:50,630 --> 02:02:54,080
Was that because there was a chance he
would make it even through the procedure?

2337
02:02:55,200 --> 02:02:59,920
I get to go to Ted again. It was like
the first piece. That's, that's all.

2338
02:02:59,990 --> 02:03:01,700
That's amazing.
It's so hearing that then,

2339
02:03:01,701 --> 02:03:04,190
and then he had complications a few
weeks later that he passed from.

2340
02:03:04,191 --> 02:03:08,030
But just knowing how much that meant to
him and how much time I did get to spend

2341
02:03:08,031 --> 02:03:11,060
with them purposefully,
it was really took the edge off.

2342
02:03:11,061 --> 02:03:12,310
Like if we were estranged,

2343
02:03:12,320 --> 02:03:16,910
if I was at odds with him than I had
really I think be torn up with guilt of

2344
02:03:16,911 --> 02:03:20,120
having not come to closure and we
had nothing. I mean, he's my hero.

2345
02:03:21,340 --> 02:03:24,050
I've only had positive thoughts
about him filling my life,

2346
02:03:24,051 --> 02:03:27,260
so I made it easier ironically to lose
the guy that I had the best relationship

2347
02:03:27,261 --> 02:03:31,760
with. Yeah, I mean this is like, as
you said, it's part of the cycle. Um,

2348
02:03:31,761 --> 02:03:34,190
I'm certainly not looking forward to
it. I mean, people will ask me like,

2349
02:03:34,191 --> 02:03:36,650
what do you fear? What are you
afraid of? And there, you know,

2350
02:03:36,651 --> 02:03:40,480
there are certainly things, uh, not,
not as many as one might expect. I mean,

2351
02:03:40,510 --> 02:03:41,810
I don't want to be eaten
by sharks or anything,

2352
02:03:41,870 --> 02:03:45,110
but I don't spend a lot of time
dwelling on the fear of that happening,

2353
02:03:45,420 --> 02:03:50,330
that just watching my parents get older
and ultimately pass away is something

2354
02:03:50,331 --> 02:03:54,230
that I, yeah, I think qualify
as definitely something
that occupies my mind and I,

2355
02:03:54,231 --> 02:03:57,800
oh, Matt, a huge debt of gratitude
because he led me to the tail end.

2356
02:03:58,190 --> 02:04:01,610
I read the tail end and that led me
a number of years ago to start taking

2357
02:04:01,611 --> 02:04:04,370
extended trips with my
parents, uh, twice a year.

2358
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:09,110
So at six month intervals we have
not just the trip, which is usually,

2359
02:04:09,350 --> 02:04:12,510
let's just call it two to three weeks,
but uh,

2360
02:04:12,540 --> 02:04:14,120
where I usually take them
somewhere they haven't been,

2361
02:04:14,570 --> 02:04:19,570
but also the entire period in between
during which we can look forward to the

2362
02:04:19,851 --> 02:04:23,210
trip and plan the trip and talk
about the trip and that anticipation,

2363
02:04:23,211 --> 02:04:28,130
I feel like hiss or 70, 80% of
the enjoyment of it. Exactly.

2364
02:04:28,190 --> 02:04:31,280
And so I had a huge thank you
and he recommended a book to me.

2365
02:04:31,281 --> 02:04:33,170
I haven't yet read, but
um, I'm hoping to soon,

2366
02:04:33,171 --> 02:04:38,130
which I believe is on grief and grieving.
Um, and uh, he's been on the podcast

2367
02:04:38,130 --> 02:04:41,790
that people look up his last
name and grief and grieving.
Sure. The correct title,

2368
02:04:41,791 --> 02:04:42,900
if that isn't,
it will pop up.

2369
02:04:42,901 --> 02:04:46,830
But he recommended that everyone read
it even before passing of loved ones.

2370
02:04:47,250 --> 02:04:49,380
So we talked about Matt Mullenweg,

2371
02:04:49,980 --> 02:04:54,980
I pinged him to ask him what subjects
or questions might be interesting to

2372
02:04:55,501 --> 02:04:58,890
explore. And one of them was
parenting. So it's, it's a good segue.

2373
02:04:59,970 --> 02:05:04,970
How do you think about parenting or do
it maybe doing it differently is too

2374
02:05:05,191 --> 02:05:06,380
awkward question to answer,

2375
02:05:06,390 --> 02:05:11,370
but what are some of the things that
you think are important in parenting?

2376
02:05:12,250 --> 02:05:15,280
Well, you know, we don't really get
manuals on how to do it. Yeah. The people,

2377
02:05:15,370 --> 02:05:16,050
young parents,

2378
02:05:16,050 --> 02:05:19,540
the first time parents are sort of thrust
into it and then you find your own way.

2379
02:05:19,870 --> 02:05:21,640
The thing I,

2380
02:05:21,641 --> 02:05:24,880
the only thing I did to prepare for being
a parent was to read scientists in the

2381
02:05:24,881 --> 02:05:28,150
crib by Alison Gopnik.
It's a not a parenting book.

2382
02:05:28,151 --> 02:05:31,380
It's basically about the neuroscience
of infants and uh, you know,

2383
02:05:31,410 --> 02:05:36,340
through two and three years old
that made it fascinating to study.

2384
02:05:36,341 --> 02:05:39,760
And I mean literally this incredible
creature when they were pre verbal,

2385
02:05:39,761 --> 02:05:42,790
it sort of created a
bond that some dads lack.

2386
02:05:42,791 --> 02:05:45,050
I think when they don't have that
physical connection and you know,

2387
02:05:45,051 --> 02:05:46,690
say in nursing or what have you,

2388
02:05:46,691 --> 02:05:51,520
that a mom might have and yet to marvel
at this, this is creation that, uh,

2389
02:05:51,570 --> 02:05:54,670
is in front of you.
The things like how they pick up language,

2390
02:05:54,671 --> 02:05:58,210
how they envision system develops it.
That actually gave me straight,

2391
02:05:58,211 --> 02:05:59,440
I'm going to under strange rat hole here,

2392
02:05:59,441 --> 02:06:01,150
but it gave me strange
stranger experiments to run,

2393
02:06:01,151 --> 02:06:05,230
like pushing the bassinet on the first
day of life under a light overhead that

2394
02:06:05,231 --> 02:06:08,260
was an l shape and the baby's
eyes would open immediately.

2395
02:06:08,261 --> 02:06:10,810
Every time I went over there cause he
could actually see it through the closed

2396
02:06:10,811 --> 02:06:13,930
eye and any edge detection just fires up
the brains. I was like, she had visitors,

2397
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:18,340
hey watch this puffy, the eyes open. Um,
and then during phony and development,

2398
02:06:18,341 --> 02:06:21,490
meaning learning language,
practicing Buh Buh sounds cause it's like,

2399
02:06:21,610 --> 02:06:22,240
it's sort of,

2400
02:06:22,240 --> 02:06:24,310
we take it for granted but we learn
how to speak by watching others.

2401
02:06:24,311 --> 02:06:26,500
Like what are you doing with your
lips to make that sound right?

2402
02:06:26,501 --> 02:06:30,370
So it made young childhood development
easy. Then I got into my groove,

2403
02:06:30,371 --> 02:06:31,510
which is like my power alley,

2404
02:06:31,511 --> 02:06:34,450
which is playing with like kids
getting down at their level,

2405
02:06:34,451 --> 02:06:38,410
whether it's Legos or blocks or whatever.
And just exploration and fun.

2406
02:06:38,411 --> 02:06:42,580
So what I loved about being a parent
in the early years was an excuse to

2407
02:06:42,581 --> 02:06:46,320
rediscover Mindstorms NXT or commercial
lego's in general. Then Mindstorms,

2408
02:06:46,330 --> 02:06:47,440
which got so much better.

2409
02:06:47,441 --> 02:06:49,900
The toys have gotten so much better
drones and I'm looking right,

2410
02:06:49,901 --> 02:06:51,190
so when the kids are older,

2411
02:06:51,191 --> 02:06:56,191
but basically playing with kids to me is
super invigorating and metaphorically,

2412
02:06:58,190 --> 02:07:02,410
uh, I think a lot of engineers,
scientists and people close to that field,

2413
02:07:02,411 --> 02:07:07,411
like even venture capitalists would do
well to try to be creative like a child

2414
02:07:07,601 --> 02:07:11,230
to engage like a child does with the
world. Well in that childlike wonder.

2415
02:07:11,810 --> 02:07:13,310
Yeah. Not to interrupt, but this,

2416
02:07:13,330 --> 02:07:16,160
this brings to mind and
just for longtime listeners,

2417
02:07:16,161 --> 02:07:19,010
the reason that I'm not going to ask a
lot of my rapid fire questions that I

2418
02:07:19,011 --> 02:07:21,020
normally do is because Steve,

2419
02:07:21,021 --> 02:07:25,010
you were kind enough to answer how good
a good number of them in my last book,

2420
02:07:25,011 --> 02:07:25,611
tribe of mentors.

2421
02:07:25,611 --> 02:07:28,790
But in that I asked you what you would
put on a billboard and you said celebrate

2422
02:07:28,791 --> 02:07:31,250
the child. Like mind. Yeah. So I,

2423
02:07:31,560 --> 02:07:34,090
I mean I don't want to interrupt
the discussion with parents.

2424
02:07:34,110 --> 02:07:36,040
It's almost like a mantra
came out of parenting,

2425
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:39,610
which is, I could see how, and
then this is something by the way,

2426
02:07:39,611 --> 02:07:42,580
that hearkens back indirectly to
this book scientist in the crib,

2427
02:07:42,581 --> 02:07:46,630
that babies are like scientists.
They form conjectures and hypotheses.

2428
02:07:46,631 --> 02:07:48,700
They test the world of an inverse
to putting things in their mouth.

2429
02:07:48,701 --> 02:07:51,250
They're playing with everything.
Sometimes it frustrates a parent,

2430
02:07:51,251 --> 02:07:54,220
but when you see them as scientists doing
experiments and learning how the world

2431
02:07:54,221 --> 02:07:55,900
works from a sort of boot up phase,

2432
02:07:56,470 --> 02:08:00,520
it is metaphorical for what we lose
after oftentimes after many years of

2433
02:08:00,521 --> 02:08:03,010
traditional education that can
beat the creativity out of you.

2434
02:08:03,400 --> 02:08:07,630
And I think the best engineers in the
best scientists have that kind of a

2435
02:08:07,631 --> 02:08:11,160
childlike mind. You can see it in the
writings of fine mine and find it.

2436
02:08:11,170 --> 02:08:14,500
And even Einstein and Newton and others
like Newton I think once famously said,

2437
02:08:14,501 --> 02:08:18,490
I felt like nothing but a child
playing on this on the shoe store. Um,

2438
02:08:18,970 --> 02:08:23,120
that there's something
deeply resonant about, um,

2439
02:08:24,220 --> 02:08:29,080
seeing the conductivity and things as a
child would and avoiding the strictures

2440
02:08:29,110 --> 02:08:31,750
and mental ruts that academic disciplines,

2441
02:08:31,751 --> 02:08:36,220
foster and job sort of tracks.
I think about discipline,

2442
02:08:36,340 --> 02:08:38,260
track.
Those are both two things I don't like.

2443
02:08:39,010 --> 02:08:41,590
I'd rather have less discipline
and less tracks, right?

2444
02:08:41,591 --> 02:08:45,660
I'd rather be exploratory
and creative. And so, um,

2445
02:08:46,090 --> 02:08:48,520
I found children and to be
a wonderful opportunity,

2446
02:08:48,760 --> 02:08:50,620
it's in such a wind when
you're connecting with them,

2447
02:08:50,621 --> 02:08:54,340
you're mindful of your presence and
that later rolls into reading with them.

2448
02:08:54,341 --> 02:08:57,550
And I spent a lot of time and tried to,
whenever I'm with them,

2449
02:08:57,551 --> 02:08:59,260
do what they like to do,
right.

2450
02:08:59,261 --> 02:09:02,080
Engage with them in the kinds of toys
and things that they like and then push

2451
02:09:02,081 --> 02:09:06,520
that a little further with all kinds
of, uh, uh, actually put it, you know,

2452
02:09:06,640 --> 02:09:10,580
tech infused adjuncts to what they
might normally be playing with. We,

2453
02:09:10,810 --> 02:09:14,740
we probably don't have time to go into it
right now on in this conversation, but,

2454
02:09:14,780 --> 02:09:18,820
uh, people working, people learn about
your rocket. Oh, rocket building.

2455
02:09:19,270 --> 02:09:22,930
So I did a short ted talk on the,
the joys of rocketry or, yeah,

2456
02:09:22,931 --> 02:09:27,850
I think it's called the joys of rocketry.
Uh, so ever since my son turned three,

2457
02:09:28,120 --> 02:09:30,250
we started launching motto rockets.
I in this story there was,

2458
02:09:30,251 --> 02:09:33,900
I just went to a local toy store back
when they had them, um, you know,

2459
02:09:33,910 --> 02:09:38,410
physical place and saw this
Estes rocket kit, you know,
ready to fly. I'm like, wow,

2460
02:09:38,411 --> 02:09:41,200
I sorta remember rockets and has little,
I wasn't that into them.

2461
02:09:41,201 --> 02:09:45,160
I built a couple. Um, and so we did
this. And to make long story short,

2462
02:09:45,161 --> 02:09:46,840
I found a mentor that could teach me like,
you know,

2463
02:09:46,841 --> 02:09:50,920
you can get really bigger engines in
bigger rockets to f to the present day.

2464
02:09:50,920 --> 02:09:53,170
I've probably launched
thousands of rockets.

2465
02:09:53,500 --> 02:09:56,320
I Three d print these designs is to my
son and I have been working on this.

2466
02:09:56,321 --> 02:09:59,110
We got to the black rock desert every
year and launch like really big things

2467
02:09:59,380 --> 02:10:04,270
going well, past supersonic speeds, uh,
routinely, um, launching large rockets.

2468
02:10:04,271 --> 02:10:06,910
The rockets he could fit
inside, um, as a, as a hobby.

2469
02:10:07,570 --> 02:10:10,120
That's by the way where he
first met planet labs was
out in the desert launching

2470
02:10:10,121 --> 02:10:13,360
rockets as an aside. So occasional
good business comes out of it too.

2471
02:10:13,720 --> 02:10:17,230
But most of all it's this
incredible hobby of um,

2472
02:10:17,260 --> 02:10:19,500
making science real light
when something fails,

2473
02:10:19,501 --> 02:10:22,000
launched or explodes
in the pad or you know,

2474
02:10:22,340 --> 02:10:25,120
comes back in because the parachute
didn't deploy properly. Um,

2475
02:10:25,300 --> 02:10:28,750
it is just visually exciting.
I don't know, I just,

2476
02:10:29,110 --> 02:10:32,620
I can't really put my finger on why
it's not universally exciting to me.

2477
02:10:32,621 --> 02:10:34,940
It just feels like something
everyone should do a little bit of.

2478
02:10:36,090 --> 02:10:39,880
So tongue, my main science real,
there were, there were a few

2479
02:10:41,560 --> 02:10:44,350
tidbits that I pulled from one of your,

2480
02:10:44,950 --> 02:10:49,120
your indices on various talks and uh,

2481
02:10:49,690 --> 02:10:53,880
they were just seemed like fantastic
attention grabbing headlines that they're

2482
02:10:54,760 --> 02:10:56,080
not intended to be, that
I was like, you know,

2483
02:10:56,110 --> 02:10:58,990
I'd be interested in hearing the answer
or just a little bit of elaboration on

2484
02:10:58,991 --> 02:11:03,550
this one was drones and how to
eliminate the TSA. So what's,

2485
02:11:03,580 --> 02:11:07,030
what's the short ish?
It doesn't have to be super short,

2486
02:11:07,031 --> 02:11:10,810
but explanation of what that means. Sure.
And so the Jones' thing is peripheral,

2487
02:11:10,811 --> 02:11:14,950
but how to eliminate the TSA
was an epiphany I had back,

2488
02:11:14,951 --> 02:11:17,950
I think it was around 2005,

2489
02:11:19,450 --> 02:11:24,240
uh, or maybe earlier, maybe 2003,
um, post nine 11 TSA is, you know,

2490
02:11:24,630 --> 02:11:27,030
God in full effect doing all
kinds of crazy things. You know,

2491
02:11:27,031 --> 02:11:30,300
I think they just implemented the shoe
thing, you know, for the first time.

2492
02:11:30,810 --> 02:11:34,650
And I met this sort of brainstorming
effort with them where they gave us the

2493
02:11:34,651 --> 02:11:35,810
challenge,
you know,

2494
02:11:35,820 --> 02:11:40,820
how can we rapidly are
radically streamline airport
security operations to get

2495
02:11:40,950 --> 02:11:45,180
on the plane sooner. And this was
at the time looking at 18 years,

2496
02:11:45,240 --> 02:11:48,610
I don't know why, 18 years, maybe
it was 2002 and it'd be 2020 maybe.

2497
02:11:48,810 --> 02:11:53,160
Maybe it was 2002. Okay. And so I came to
that, I think it was only tech guy there.

2498
02:11:53,430 --> 02:11:56,520
Um, the only, well 18 years, that's
a long time to predict things.

2499
02:11:56,521 --> 02:11:58,920
We'd invested by the way in some
airport security technology stuff,

2500
02:11:58,921 --> 02:12:00,840
but I didn't really talk about
any of that. I was like 18 years,

2501
02:12:00,841 --> 02:12:04,560
that's going to be, you know,
perhaps 18 doublings of Moore's law,

2502
02:12:04,590 --> 02:12:09,070
which would be 256,000 x compute power.
Hmm.

2503
02:12:09,330 --> 02:12:14,040
What might someone do then that they
couldn't do? Now we'll autonomous flight.

2504
02:12:14,041 --> 02:12:16,380
It was like, there's a lot, by the
way, as long before autonomous driving,

2505
02:12:16,400 --> 02:12:20,520
autonomous flight or drones was a thing.
Um, that those words didn't exist,

2506
02:12:22,350 --> 02:12:24,870
at least not in the vernacular
products. And I said, well,

2507
02:12:25,170 --> 02:12:27,630
there's no question that we could
have a Thomas flight by then.

2508
02:12:27,631 --> 02:12:30,180
18 years in the future about your 20,
20 like autonomous planes.

2509
02:12:30,181 --> 02:12:33,060
Cause we already can today. Right?
By the way, Airbus and Boeing,

2510
02:12:33,061 --> 02:12:34,980
every one of those planes can
land better than the pilot.

2511
02:12:34,981 --> 02:12:39,030
Good and take off everything. But taxing
is easy compared to autonomous driving.

2512
02:12:39,630 --> 02:12:42,930
Any case, um, no one else was on
that page. And I said, well wait,

2513
02:12:42,931 --> 02:12:44,290
do you guys what happened?
Is there no cockpit?

2514
02:12:44,291 --> 02:12:45,840
They made that a really
nice first class lounge.

2515
02:12:45,870 --> 02:12:50,280
The plane can't be used as a weapon,
right? So why have any security gateway?

2516
02:12:50,370 --> 02:12:53,370
Right? So just what you could do
instead is go in with some biometrics.

2517
02:12:53,371 --> 02:12:54,360
We know who's on the plane,

2518
02:12:54,510 --> 02:12:57,750
have video surveillance in the plane as
the trade off and bring whatever weapon

2519
02:12:57,751 --> 02:13:00,990
you want on the plan. This would be a
really bad place to go kill 200 people,

2520
02:13:01,320 --> 02:13:04,050
right? Because you're going to get
caught, right? If you're a terrorist cell,

2521
02:13:04,051 --> 02:13:06,570
you will get caught.
If you can't use it as a terrorist weapon,

2522
02:13:06,600 --> 02:13:11,050
then why have the TSA at all?
And then there was the wall web.

2523
02:13:11,051 --> 02:13:14,220
We will it really work and it will to
have autonomous flight. And we, we should,

2524
02:13:14,221 --> 02:13:16,500
we should be doing it today with
today's technology. No doubt about it.

2525
02:13:16,501 --> 02:13:20,250
And you could telematically operated at
each airport for the taxi part if that's

2526
02:13:20,251 --> 02:13:21,930
really so hard.
Um,

2527
02:13:22,200 --> 02:13:25,100
but anything that's that hard and then
you get to go a step further to say, well,

2528
02:13:25,101 --> 02:13:27,270
okay, well what about bombs? You know,
made the plane falls out of the sky.

2529
02:13:27,280 --> 02:13:30,480
Your luggage could fly separately in the
autonomous thing from the plane itself,

2530
02:13:30,481 --> 02:13:33,630
you'd have a smaller only plane.
Uh, for the actual cargo part.

2531
02:13:33,930 --> 02:13:36,410
You could have smaller
planes, you know, the,

2532
02:13:36,411 --> 02:13:39,270
the whole design space starts to change
in terms of what the optimal design is.

2533
02:13:39,271 --> 02:13:42,870
If you're not amortizing a pilot anymore
in terms of that operational costs.

2534
02:13:42,930 --> 02:13:45,870
And you could have multiple flights
where there was a single one before.

2535
02:13:46,080 --> 02:13:48,840
Now there's even less people per plane
and more flexibility in your roots.

2536
02:13:48,841 --> 02:13:51,160
All the unpacks.
And I asked them like,

2537
02:13:51,300 --> 02:13:54,120
have you even calculated the
economic impact of the shoe policy?

2538
02:13:54,330 --> 02:13:55,360
And they didn't know what I meant.
Like,

2539
02:13:55,470 --> 02:13:58,350
well you could just take like how much
time does that just add to the queue or

2540
02:13:58,351 --> 02:14:02,020
the average traveler times average salary
of the average American and just the

2541
02:14:02,040 --> 02:14:04,650
economic deadweight loss,
like, you know, and,

2542
02:14:04,690 --> 02:14:07,770
and part of what I tried to show them is
that the immune response of a system is

2543
02:14:07,771 --> 02:14:10,290
often worse and what kills
you not pathogen. Right?

2544
02:14:10,291 --> 02:14:13,320
So it's often our own immune system
that kills us literally as the method of

2545
02:14:13,321 --> 02:14:17,880
death. And I said, well, how long till
someone like puts a battery on fire,

2546
02:14:17,910 --> 02:14:19,980
you're going to keep the laptops
and cell phones off the plan.

2547
02:14:19,981 --> 02:14:22,290
Do you realize the economic impact of
that and they don't want to hear it.

2548
02:14:22,291 --> 02:14:24,330
And I was, I'm glad that it hasn't
happened quite yet, but I'm like,

2549
02:14:24,720 --> 02:14:27,090
that's what the terrorist cell should
be doing to cause the most harm.

2550
02:14:27,091 --> 02:14:28,290
Just like have one Yahoo,

2551
02:14:28,650 --> 02:14:32,410
make a halfassed attempt delight battery
and fire on a plane and now look what

2552
02:14:32,411 --> 02:14:35,610
it did do. I was like, I was in a
flight from, I want to say it was,

2553
02:14:35,640 --> 02:14:36,790
I mean I was in a far flung place,

2554
02:14:36,791 --> 02:14:40,860
but I think it was Uzbekistan to
is stumble or stumble to London.

2555
02:14:40,861 --> 02:14:41,760
It was one of the two.

2556
02:14:42,090 --> 02:14:47,090
And we actually had to surrender all of
our laptops and it created the amount of

2557
02:14:47,311 --> 02:14:52,311
confusion and congestion and craziness
that that created was just unbelievable.

2558
02:14:53,940 --> 02:14:58,800
Yeah. Yeah. So the, the end
of the TSA. That's right.

2559
02:14:59,580 --> 02:15:01,860
Wouldn't that be wonderful?
How do you,

2560
02:15:01,890 --> 02:15:06,890
how do you budget as a technology
investor for regulatory or political

2561
02:15:08,760 --> 02:15:13,290
opposition from incumbents? Right,
right. And you could look at,

2562
02:15:13,760 --> 02:15:17,650
uh, I mean many different
examples of this, whether it's uh,

2563
02:15:17,760 --> 02:15:22,760
lobbyists or extremely powerful unions
of various types that would be strongly,

2564
02:15:22,921 --> 02:15:23,371
strongly,

2565
02:15:23,371 --> 02:15:28,371
strongly incentivized to
not allow something like the
Tsa to no pilots' unions.

2566
02:15:29,761 --> 02:15:33,090
I mean, some people would point out the
uh, the, the usual like, well, you got to,

2567
02:15:33,091 --> 02:15:37,650
it got a bit of an issue here.
Um, so in the past and the 90s,

2568
02:15:37,651 --> 02:15:39,330
especially when the Internet was like,

2569
02:15:39,390 --> 02:15:41,250
you could just do Internet
for awhile and that was fine.

2570
02:15:41,460 --> 02:15:44,220
We had the mantra that never
invested in a regulated sector.

2571
02:15:44,930 --> 02:15:46,230
And still to this day,
try not to,

2572
02:15:46,260 --> 02:15:49,710
I try not to invest in
anything that requires any
law to get past in order to be

2573
02:15:49,711 --> 02:15:53,460
in business. The one exception is
when all in an autonomous driving,

2574
02:15:53,500 --> 02:15:57,060
what the product is currently illegal,
but we know it's going to become legal,

2575
02:15:57,090 --> 02:15:58,530
right?
Fully level five autonomous driving,

2576
02:15:58,800 --> 02:16:01,680
but without exception
recently and the old school,

2577
02:16:02,070 --> 02:16:04,230
if we not only try to avoid regular,
they did invite us.

2578
02:16:04,231 --> 02:16:08,070
We try to avoid if you had to deal with
in any way as a customer and a partner

2579
02:16:08,071 --> 02:16:11,550
with utilities or the government
or in any of that sector.

2580
02:16:11,790 --> 02:16:16,790
But I think frankly that left a
lot of large sectors just plump,

2581
02:16:17,460 --> 02:16:19,590
like a lot of entrepreneurs,
we're avoiding them like the plague.

2582
02:16:19,591 --> 02:16:21,870
So when Elon opened our eyes,

2583
02:16:21,871 --> 02:16:25,590
it says you can actually take on what
might be perceived to be the most uh,

2584
02:16:25,860 --> 02:16:28,680
non market if you will. Uh, you
know, or non market factors,

2585
02:16:28,681 --> 02:16:31,750
not like the best product doesn't
necessarily win up the military industrial

2586
02:16:31,751 --> 02:16:35,290
complex, right? You can take that on head
on and just win with a better product.

2587
02:16:36,160 --> 02:16:36,760
Right.

2588
02:16:36,760 --> 02:16:40,330
And similarly going up against a regulated
utilities with solar cities and like

2589
02:16:40,340 --> 02:16:42,760
sort of distributed solar solution.
And yes,

2590
02:16:42,761 --> 02:16:44,950
they're fighting with every dirty
trick you can imagine. Right?

2591
02:16:44,951 --> 02:16:46,150
They're trying every angle,

2592
02:16:46,151 --> 02:16:49,450
but sometimes there's just
such a compelling advantage
because there's been no

2593
02:16:49,451 --> 02:16:50,760
new injury for like 25 years.

2594
02:16:51,130 --> 02:16:54,520
They haven't faced a competitive
threat in their institutional lifetime.

2595
02:16:55,090 --> 02:16:59,020
They really don't know how to behave in
response. So you have on one hand, yes,

2596
02:16:59,021 --> 02:17:01,990
they'll try to do Daschle things and I
don't know what to say other than you

2597
02:17:01,991 --> 02:17:04,870
just kind of hope that enough of
normal democracy will flourish,

2598
02:17:04,871 --> 02:17:07,870
that you can overcome that and not
have critical wounds. We'll see.

2599
02:17:08,830 --> 02:17:12,190
But on the other side,
you don't usually know.

2600
02:17:12,220 --> 02:17:14,410
Like when I was in software
investing as a primary focus,

2601
02:17:14,650 --> 02:17:18,270
you don't usually find opportunities to
make a hundred fold or a thousandfold

2602
02:17:18,280 --> 02:17:21,220
cost advantage in a product, but
you do. And some of these areas,

2603
02:17:21,221 --> 02:17:24,550
because they literally have faced
no competitive threat for so long,

2604
02:17:24,551 --> 02:17:27,630
they don't even know what it's like
to compete. They take like, um,

2605
02:17:27,730 --> 02:17:28,541
the aerospace industry,

2606
02:17:28,541 --> 02:17:32,260
there's a number of Chinese ministers
who early on once basics give their

2607
02:17:32,261 --> 02:17:37,120
pricing for the Falcon nine, they
said, w those prices are not real.

2608
02:17:37,150 --> 02:17:39,340
We could not compete
at those price points.

2609
02:17:39,370 --> 02:17:40,960
Even if we had all of Western technology,

2610
02:17:40,990 --> 02:17:44,740
like it's game over and other
US competitors said, well,

2611
02:17:44,741 --> 02:17:46,500
we basically have to shut down
our product lines. I'm like,

2612
02:17:46,610 --> 02:17:50,020
imagine if some competitive oracle or
Microsoft said we're going to come out

2613
02:17:50,021 --> 02:17:53,050
with something like, Oh yeah,
you're right, we'd better
stop selling windows. Right.

2614
02:17:53,200 --> 02:17:56,110
Or we're just going to not
do databases anymore. Cause
I, yeah. That, that's better.

2615
02:17:56,350 --> 02:17:57,250
And I think they know,

2616
02:17:57,251 --> 02:18:01,690
company responds with we're shutting
down our entire product line and we were

2617
02:18:01,691 --> 02:18:06,330
the monopoly. Oh by the way,
with a monopolist prior,
we were the thing. Right.

2618
02:18:06,520 --> 02:18:08,350
And, uh, you know, you know, and, and,

2619
02:18:08,380 --> 02:18:11,980
and the only caveat is they say that
we're shutting down our product lines,

2620
02:18:12,130 --> 02:18:16,780
but government, you got to have
another company. So give us $4 billion,

2621
02:18:16,781 --> 02:18:19,210
we'll build a better one. We can do
it. We can build and get us $4 billion.

2622
02:18:19,450 --> 02:18:22,530
Like we forgot to innovate for 25 years,
but now it give us a pile of money.

2623
02:18:22,540 --> 02:18:26,480
We'll start. Right. It's wild. Yeah.
I never seen anything like it. Um,

2624
02:18:27,220 --> 02:18:31,570
so one thing that we chatted a little
bit about before recording that I wanted

2625
02:18:31,571 --> 02:18:36,571
to ask you about is printed
organs and synthetic meat.

2626
02:18:39,040 --> 02:18:42,240
So, hopefully not in the same dish
that hopefully not in the same dish.

2627
02:18:42,320 --> 02:18:47,080
You never know you the organ meats, the
old nose to tail. But uh, in this case,

2628
02:18:47,300 --> 02:18:50,620
um, you'd have to, I suppose,
imagine the exterior would be,

2629
02:18:50,710 --> 02:18:54,130
would be a figment of your imagination,
uh, in the case of synthetic meat.

2630
02:18:54,131 --> 02:18:55,000
But can you,

2631
02:18:55,300 --> 02:18:58,900
where are things currently with synthetic
meat and where will they be in the

2632
02:18:59,200 --> 02:19:02,600
relatively near term? Yeah. And why is it
important for that matter? I think it's,

2633
02:19:02,620 --> 02:19:05,490
that's a great question. So, um, and
the reason I think it's great as is,

2634
02:19:05,500 --> 02:19:10,090
I think it's one of the major tech themes
or factors that will affect a lot of

2635
02:19:10,091 --> 02:19:12,190
people's lives over the
next 10 to 20 years.

2636
02:19:12,250 --> 02:19:15,460
And not everyone is fully aware of it yet.
And it's an inevitability.

2637
02:19:15,461 --> 02:19:18,670
So back when we were talking about,
you know, these inevitable futures,

2638
02:19:18,671 --> 02:19:21,100
like all cars will be electric,
all vehicles will be autonomous.

2639
02:19:21,340 --> 02:19:25,150
This is one of those we will not
slaughter animals to get meat in though.

2640
02:19:25,151 --> 02:19:27,740
The question is, is that 50
years out is that 500 years out?

2641
02:19:27,770 --> 02:19:30,320
But just like we won't burn
oil and gas 500 years out,

2642
02:19:30,321 --> 02:19:32,530
there's just no way we would
do that in 500 years out.

2643
02:19:32,900 --> 02:19:35,810
Especially not in small
internal combustion engines
that we won't slaughter a

2644
02:19:35,811 --> 02:19:38,030
cow to get a steak.
And so the,

2645
02:19:38,240 --> 02:19:43,240
the insight occurs when you realize first
it's a much cheaper and efficient way

2646
02:19:43,701 --> 02:19:46,840
to grow the product you need without
the whole cow. Like the hide.

2647
02:19:46,850 --> 02:19:50,000
You don't need the methane production,
you don't need all the inefficiency.

2648
02:19:50,001 --> 02:19:53,420
That was an artifact of biological
evolution. You don't leave the land,

2649
02:19:53,421 --> 02:19:55,310
use the water,
use the energy use.

2650
02:19:55,311 --> 02:19:58,310
You can cut all that somewhere between
10 and a hundred x, all of those factors,

2651
02:19:58,640 --> 02:20:00,530
which by the way, for the, for
the listeners who don't know this,

2652
02:20:00,531 --> 02:20:04,730
about a third of all usable land on
earth is, goes to meet to production.

2653
02:20:05,030 --> 02:20:08,600
So this is the grain that gets fed to
cows and pigs and chickens and the land

2654
02:20:08,601 --> 02:20:12,710
that those animals live on. So like a
third of all usable land. It's astounding,

2655
02:20:12,711 --> 02:20:15,890
right? It's like one of the biggest
water problems, the biggest methane gas,

2656
02:20:15,891 --> 02:20:18,590
which is one of the most serious,
uh, greenhouse gas problems.

2657
02:20:18,591 --> 02:20:21,710
It's sort of on par with the whole
petrochemical economy or in another hands.

2658
02:20:21,711 --> 02:20:22,520
If you could say,

2659
02:20:22,520 --> 02:20:25,700
I will get rid of oil and gas forever
or it'll get rid of meat production,

2660
02:20:25,790 --> 02:20:28,280
you'd be better off getting rid of meat
production in the short term in terms of

2661
02:20:28,281 --> 02:20:31,880
greenhouse gases in the environment.
So pretty big, big deal. Okay.

2662
02:20:32,750 --> 02:20:33,770
So why is this possible?

2663
02:20:34,700 --> 02:20:37,610
There are two major branches of
companies that are trying to solve this.

2664
02:20:37,611 --> 02:20:40,760
One branch is to replace meat with
something that's not meat and there's an,

2665
02:20:40,761 --> 02:20:42,010
I applaud those efforts.
Um,

2666
02:20:42,050 --> 02:20:44,570
it's a little bit of a more of an
engineering challenge to get it past the

2667
02:20:44,571 --> 02:20:46,850
consumer and each product
has its own engineer.

2668
02:20:46,851 --> 02:20:49,760
Each and every product is challenging
and make the duck tastes like duck,

2669
02:20:49,761 --> 02:20:52,680
make the chicken tastes like Jagan and
have it not just be like, you know,

2670
02:20:52,730 --> 02:20:53,710
sausages and hotdogs,

2671
02:20:53,750 --> 02:20:57,170
but actually filet if you want to
take on the whole core of the market.

2672
02:20:57,650 --> 02:21:01,530
So that will make a meaningful impact.
And be important.

2673
02:21:01,531 --> 02:21:04,220
It's just gonna be slow moving because
of how hard it is to do each product and

2674
02:21:04,221 --> 02:21:08,120
to make it anything passable
as challenging. Extremely
hard. I mean exactly.

2675
02:21:08,121 --> 02:21:10,640
I've tried a lot of people been trying
every which way to do a Veggie Burger.

2676
02:21:10,641 --> 02:21:14,700
There's big breakthroughs recently
by using heme and plant based team.

2677
02:21:15,480 --> 02:21:19,940
Just like a possible, that means you get
a veggie burger that bleeds basically.

2678
02:21:19,940 --> 02:21:20,510
Exactly.

2679
02:21:20,510 --> 02:21:23,990
Cause that they found a route of soy
plant that has a molecular cage that holds

2680
02:21:23,991 --> 02:21:26,090
an iron atom in the center
that's called the Porphyrin.

2681
02:21:26,390 --> 02:21:28,390
That's the same molecule
kind of structures.

2682
02:21:28,430 --> 02:21:31,220
We have an hemoglobin that makes your
blood red, that makes it, you know,

2683
02:21:31,221 --> 02:21:35,480
turn color when it gets out of your body.
Um, that makes you right. Steak turn red,

2684
02:21:35,481 --> 02:21:38,440
that makes it tastes the way it does.
That makes it barbecue the way it does.

2685
02:21:38,450 --> 02:21:41,090
The way it browns, when you buy all
those things you put in a plant, right?

2686
02:21:41,210 --> 02:21:44,210
You can also put it by the way, you can
make chicken and red meat is kind of fun.

2687
02:21:44,240 --> 02:21:48,440
But anyway, that's the plant based
approach. It's a lot of engineering,

2688
02:21:48,470 --> 02:21:50,030
a lot of effort,
a lot of money per product.

2689
02:21:50,060 --> 02:21:53,750
The other pushes when we invested in
called Memphis meats and others like that

2690
02:21:54,090 --> 02:21:56,570
says let's just make steak,
let's make chicken,

2691
02:21:56,600 --> 02:21:59,720
let's make any of these products
in like not just the subject,

2692
02:21:59,721 --> 02:22:03,190
make the exact same thing
but don't grow it in account.

2693
02:22:03,200 --> 02:22:06,050
So it's more of a change in the
manufacturing method quite simply. Right.

2694
02:22:06,140 --> 02:22:08,420
Do you have the cow making the steak
or do you have it in a lab now?

2695
02:22:08,421 --> 02:22:10,200
How do you make it in the lab?
Well the,

2696
02:22:10,210 --> 02:22:13,930
the team came from cardiology and other
medical backgrounds yet people that have

2697
02:22:13,931 --> 02:22:16,250
done work in stem cell biology
and people have worked in,

2698
02:22:16,251 --> 02:22:19,640
you know the whole synthetic biology
area and it's pretty straight forward to

2699
02:22:19,641 --> 02:22:21,260
grow cells.
You take stem cells,

2700
02:22:21,530 --> 02:22:24,680
you can induce them be pluripotent or
reducing the being mortal basically and

2701
02:22:24,681 --> 02:22:28,830
you can just grow an infinite number of
these cells that could become anything.

2702
02:22:28,831 --> 02:22:32,280
They could become skeletal muscle, they
become nerves. They could become skin.

2703
02:22:32,820 --> 02:22:35,040
And the way you differentiate
them into skeletal muscle,

2704
02:22:35,041 --> 02:22:38,820
which is like our muscles and our arms
is you put them on a scaffold that causes

2705
02:22:38,821 --> 02:22:42,020
them to differentiate into that kind
of thing. A scaffold that is um,

2706
02:22:42,150 --> 02:22:45,480
it's an edible gelatin like thing kind of,
you know,

2707
02:22:45,481 --> 02:22:48,320
it's basically some other food products
and things like we had college in and

2708
02:22:48,321 --> 02:22:50,280
other stuff you have the
scaffold is things Arrow Gel.

2709
02:22:50,520 --> 02:22:54,690
The cells differentiate and they merged
together and he's long fibers just like

2710
02:22:54,691 --> 02:22:55,530
our muscle cells.

2711
02:22:55,680 --> 02:22:59,190
So what were formerly discreet stand
on the cells form into one long multi

2712
02:22:59,220 --> 02:23:01,710
multinucleated cell. It
twitches, it does everything.

2713
02:23:01,711 --> 02:23:05,550
Like a normal muscle is a muscle cell.
That species where I have tasted the duck,

2714
02:23:05,610 --> 02:23:06,443
but most recently,

2715
02:23:06,630 --> 02:23:11,630
so it's duck muscle and over time you
can add the irregularities of sinew and

2716
02:23:12,541 --> 02:23:14,820
all this very, now it's just like a
perfect cut of duck muscle. You know,

2717
02:23:14,821 --> 02:23:19,710
the mouthfeel everything. It's just the
same thing. Everything's a filet Mignon.

2718
02:23:19,770 --> 02:23:22,350
Exactly. By the way, in the
future, you can make it healthier.

2719
02:23:22,380 --> 02:23:25,470
You can make it all a mega three
rich oils. You could tune things,

2720
02:23:25,471 --> 02:23:28,600
but let's just start with a simple,
don't confuse the market with it's,

2721
02:23:29,050 --> 02:23:32,310
it's not Turducken, it's Turkey
arts dog. It's not a blend.

2722
02:23:32,670 --> 02:23:34,500
But you imagine blending
is like a simple thing.

2723
02:23:34,530 --> 02:23:36,180
Like there's no reason you
can do infinite blending,

2724
02:23:36,181 --> 02:23:38,190
like blending a wine and make
it just the right mouthfeel,

2725
02:23:38,330 --> 02:23:40,770
just the right whatever.
Right? So, but in their term,

2726
02:23:40,800 --> 02:23:42,900
let's not jump ahead of ourselves.
It's just a substitute.

2727
02:23:43,440 --> 02:23:46,290
And you can do this in
small, like, you know,

2728
02:23:46,291 --> 02:23:48,270
like a Chinese shipping
container kind of things.

2729
02:23:48,271 --> 02:23:49,920
You could put this near
the point of consumption.

2730
02:23:49,921 --> 02:23:52,830
You could have this in urban areas and
you're not shipping meet all around the

2731
02:23:52,831 --> 02:23:55,090
country is growing the steak,
you know,

2732
02:23:55,140 --> 02:23:59,610
sort of to order the end cost
point should be much, much lower.

2733
02:23:59,820 --> 02:24:03,870
And so to me this had one of those sort
of lightning bolt moments of this is the

2734
02:24:03,871 --> 02:24:07,590
inevitable future. There's no technical
risks that says this couldn't happen.

2735
02:24:07,620 --> 02:24:09,440
There isn't like we have to
invent some that element.

2736
02:24:09,630 --> 02:24:12,590
There's a lot of system engineering, the
optimize it, the feed stocks, you know,

2737
02:24:12,600 --> 02:24:15,120
whatever. That's it. You know,
spilling the right reactor size,

2738
02:24:15,130 --> 02:24:16,140
it's gonna take some engineering,

2739
02:24:16,141 --> 02:24:17,730
but it's not going to
take breakthrough science.

2740
02:24:18,690 --> 02:24:20,900
It's the same epiphany that when
I first wrote in an electric car,

2741
02:24:20,920 --> 02:24:24,870
when I first had an autonomous ride early
on with the Google ones, uh, you know,

2742
02:24:24,871 --> 02:24:28,980
the, the old, uh, is that they had an
automated, it's like this is the future.

2743
02:24:28,981 --> 02:24:29,370
Like you could,

2744
02:24:29,370 --> 02:24:33,000
you could just see it like a clarion
bell ringing in your head and then a few

2745
02:24:33,001 --> 02:24:37,620
implications started the head like,
wow, this will transform the world.

2746
02:24:37,621 --> 02:24:40,740
And a lot of ways the amount of land
and resources and real estate plays that

2747
02:24:40,770 --> 02:24:44,610
relayed to me production today. Not
to mention, oh, mad cow disease,

2748
02:24:44,611 --> 02:24:47,720
influenza h one n one,
all these other things that we don't like,

2749
02:24:47,880 --> 02:24:51,450
those collaterals that the climate has
of the food industry and we haven't

2750
02:24:51,451 --> 02:24:55,760
gotten to that. Um, you can see how we'll
get from here to there that the buyers,

2751
02:24:55,770 --> 02:24:59,010
the largest buyers of meat
would absolutely like to
diversify their supply chain.

2752
02:24:59,011 --> 02:25:01,530
So they are not vulnerable
to and for sure,

2753
02:25:01,531 --> 02:25:03,840
or mad cower or any other
disruption of their supply chain,

2754
02:25:03,870 --> 02:25:05,670
you can see how they're going to want
to feather that in. So by the way,

2755
02:25:05,671 --> 02:25:06,540
Tyson and Cargill,

2756
02:25:06,780 --> 02:25:11,280
two larges me companies in America
invested in this company as well as in the

2757
02:25:11,281 --> 02:25:15,720
series a with us. And um, but then
I realized something about myself,

2758
02:25:16,170 --> 02:25:19,320
I realized for the first time something
where my future self will condemn my

2759
02:25:19,321 --> 02:25:23,590
present self is immoral. Yeah. Right.
So I know that 50 years from now,

2760
02:25:23,620 --> 02:25:27,430
once I'm eating the bacon and stake
that is not killed an animal and its

2761
02:25:27,520 --> 02:25:31,210
production, will I be able to visit
a slaughterhouse for the first time?

2762
02:25:31,580 --> 02:25:32,950
I W I won't do that today.

2763
02:25:33,010 --> 02:25:35,860
I like eating meat so much that I
refused to go visit a slaughterhouse.

2764
02:25:35,861 --> 02:25:40,000
In fact of the USTA meat inspectors,
they,

2765
02:25:40,030 --> 02:25:43,030
99% of them become vegetarian.
They don't start that way.

2766
02:25:43,260 --> 02:25:47,110
It's like if you see how it's made, you
wouldn't need it. And yet I won't do that.

2767
02:25:47,111 --> 02:25:48,190
And,
and when I say moral,

2768
02:25:48,191 --> 02:25:51,970
I think our humanity circle of empathy
expands over time. You know, first it was,

2769
02:25:51,971 --> 02:25:54,960
you know, family unit and the
tribes and the nation state,

2770
02:25:55,010 --> 02:25:59,670
then maybe global citizens. Now I think
the Inter species, if you will, um,

2771
02:25:59,830 --> 02:26:03,760
empathy is inevitable trajectory
where I would welcome that.

2772
02:26:03,761 --> 02:26:07,960
That would just be more thoughtful
about other sending organisms and their

2773
02:26:08,680 --> 02:26:11,740
wellbeing that we just
look right past today.

2774
02:26:11,920 --> 02:26:16,720
It's kind of like being a slave owner
in America back in the 17 hundreds, eh,

2775
02:26:16,800 --> 02:26:17,950
the economy depends on it.

2776
02:26:17,980 --> 02:26:20,200
I don't want to ask questions
about how those slave ships,

2777
02:26:20,220 --> 02:26:22,990
like I'm sure slave owners didn't
visit slave ships in the few that did.

2778
02:26:22,991 --> 02:26:24,820
And we're like, oh my God,
we've got to change this. Right?

2779
02:26:25,090 --> 02:26:27,310
You just don't want to look.
And when you had the,

2780
02:26:27,460 --> 02:26:30,550
once you have the economic alternative
that doesn't have any money,

2781
02:26:30,610 --> 02:26:33,670
any compromises, it's not like, oh, it's
not really bacon or it's not really stake.

2782
02:26:33,730 --> 02:26:37,450
It's the same thing. Just no animal
died. Then you'll have the moral shift.

2783
02:26:37,570 --> 02:26:41,140
I think profoundly we're, what
is the current state? I mean,

2784
02:26:41,141 --> 02:26:44,980
what products do they have that they're
still in development because of the cost

2785
02:26:45,070 --> 02:26:48,490
side at scale.
So sure that this company's so,

2786
02:26:48,491 --> 02:26:51,220
so when I mentioned the challenge
of the plant based substitutes,

2787
02:26:51,221 --> 02:26:55,600
is engineering something
that people mistake? I mean
the, the the taste as good.

2788
02:26:56,020 --> 02:26:57,670
That's the key engineering challenge here.

2789
02:26:57,671 --> 02:26:59,710
The whole thing is just cost cause
you can make something that's

2790
02:26:59,711 --> 02:27:02,050
indistinguishable you, it just
costs too much right now. Right.

2791
02:27:02,500 --> 02:27:05,530
And there's three vectors are making it
cheaper too are like total gimmes and

2792
02:27:05,531 --> 02:27:08,800
one just was engineering.
The gimmes are just making a bigger plant.

2793
02:27:08,860 --> 02:27:10,360
So if you say you brew beer,

2794
02:27:10,361 --> 02:27:13,650
if you just have a one liter of facility
on your desktop at home and you're

2795
02:27:13,651 --> 02:27:15,850
amortize the cost of your home to
make one liter of beer at a time,

2796
02:27:15,851 --> 02:27:16,990
it's gonna be expensive liter of beer,

2797
02:27:16,991 --> 02:27:20,140
even if the formula is the same
as a production planner. So scale.

2798
02:27:20,560 --> 02:27:24,130
The second is a cheaper feed. Stocks just
feed it something other than the very,

2799
02:27:24,220 --> 02:27:25,350
very expensive serum.

2800
02:27:25,370 --> 02:27:29,440
Using analogies in RND
purposes to minimize variables
using pharmaceutical grade

2801
02:27:29,770 --> 02:27:32,800
inputs to the sort of feed the cells
if you will. What do they feed them?

2802
02:27:32,880 --> 02:27:36,790
It's like a glucose mixture
with amino acids, like a
ceremony, like a blood serum.

2803
02:27:36,820 --> 02:27:39,340
It's kind of like what you'd find in
your blood doesn't make your blood cells

2804
02:27:39,341 --> 02:27:40,930
live, you know? Wow. So, uh,

2805
02:27:41,200 --> 02:27:43,360
it's a variety stuff that's
used for very research purposes,

2806
02:27:43,361 --> 02:27:46,990
but there's no reason it couldn't be that.
But the reason it doesn't exist,

2807
02:27:46,991 --> 02:27:50,290
there's no market for
food grade, uh, you know,

2808
02:27:50,320 --> 02:27:53,630
plant based feedstocks that
cells can grow off of. Um,

2809
02:27:54,220 --> 02:27:57,690
and now we have a good reason to do
that. And then the third is just, uh,

2810
02:27:57,940 --> 02:28:02,710
various engineering optimizations on
the cells and the mixtures and like what

2811
02:28:02,711 --> 02:28:05,990
combinations of cells do you want
to try to boost the fat content?

2812
02:28:05,991 --> 02:28:08,110
They've each cell or have
separate, you know, muscle and fat.

2813
02:28:08,111 --> 02:28:11,440
Do you want to have it all be like
one, you know, one bite does all,

2814
02:28:11,441 --> 02:28:14,350
or do you want to have two different
types, you know? Well, I mean, if you,

2815
02:28:14,351 --> 02:28:16,900
a few thoughts occurred to me as
you're describing this. The first is,

2816
02:28:17,830 --> 02:28:22,730
would this company,
would this company utilize

2817
02:28:22,760 --> 02:28:23,593
the,

2818
02:28:24,440 --> 02:28:28,370
the technology to produce human tissue,
uh,

2819
02:28:28,371 --> 02:28:31,970
for regenerative medicine
or other purposes? And then
I thought to myself, wow,

2820
02:28:31,971 --> 02:28:36,290
you could also, you could become
a moral cannibal if you wanted,

2821
02:28:36,320 --> 02:28:37,520
like you could produce,

2822
02:28:37,950 --> 02:28:40,220
not that you would want it to
produce human burgers and eat them,

2823
02:28:40,221 --> 02:28:43,760
but you could ostensibly do that. But that
was just more of a thought. I was like,

2824
02:28:43,761 --> 02:28:45,150
wow, that's, that's, that's well,

2825
02:28:45,160 --> 02:28:47,930
you could also that small
donor to revive and restore,

2826
02:28:47,931 --> 02:28:50,030
which is trying to bring back
the mammoth and extinct species,

2827
02:28:50,031 --> 02:28:52,370
he could go back to have the
mammoth. That's true. That's true.

2828
02:28:53,360 --> 02:28:56,480
Without growing the mammoth.
Yeah, that's right. Yeah. The
little Panini Ganey, it's,

2829
02:28:56,600 --> 02:29:01,400
this really gave me the
brand burger brand. Uh,

2830
02:29:01,430 --> 02:29:04,220
but, uh, it, is that maybe
a, just a distraction or,

2831
02:29:04,221 --> 02:29:07,780
I don't know the technology well enough
to think of it from a, from a, from a, uh,

2832
02:29:08,060 --> 02:29:11,180
from a medical, human medical
is a good question. Yes.

2833
02:29:11,500 --> 02:29:15,880
The first sort of clean meat
or alternative meat company
that I came across was

2834
02:29:15,881 --> 02:29:18,910
using, ironically, the
reverse sequence, which is,

2835
02:29:19,150 --> 02:29:22,210
it spun out of a company that was doing
Oregon's, they'd printed bladders.

2836
02:29:22,211 --> 02:29:24,580
There's a kid I met who's
name is 18 years old.

2837
02:29:24,581 --> 02:29:29,440
He's lived with a grown bladder
for many years now. Um, and, and,

2838
02:29:29,530 --> 02:29:30,850
but that was more like a three d printer.

2839
02:29:30,851 --> 02:29:34,510
So when you're growing a specific Oregon
that needs to be functional, it's super,

2840
02:29:34,540 --> 02:29:39,130
super important to get a lot
of the details right. Um, a
chunk of skeletal muscle,

2841
02:29:39,160 --> 02:29:42,340
you know what, if you just take it from
the center piece versus the end with sin,

2842
02:29:42,341 --> 02:29:43,300
you, you know, there's variation.

2843
02:29:43,301 --> 02:29:47,000
If you want to make it function like a
muscle and the connection to your sinews

2844
02:29:47,040 --> 02:29:50,530
and what have you is you're making crown
beef from scratching just a chunk of

2845
02:29:50,531 --> 02:29:51,940
meat out of the middle.
It's just a chunk of meat.

2846
02:29:51,970 --> 02:29:56,410
So do you have much bigger challenges
with the printed Oregon's that lent itself

2847
02:29:56,411 --> 02:29:58,420
naturally to a three d printer
kind of approach and it,

2848
02:29:58,421 --> 02:30:00,510
and it works wonderfully for some organs.

2849
02:30:00,530 --> 02:30:04,150
They've been going kidneys and they're
some of the connective tissue stuff

2850
02:30:04,151 --> 02:30:07,210
around the reconstructive surgery,
um, for the face and what have you.

2851
02:30:07,900 --> 02:30:12,030
But it's slow and it's also great example
of personalized one on one marketing.

2852
02:30:12,031 --> 02:30:14,410
Like you want to go cells
that are compatible with
your body. So that you know,

2853
02:30:14,411 --> 02:30:17,880
they would source of your stem cells
to grow year Oregon for you. And it's,

2854
02:30:17,881 --> 02:30:21,370
it's kind of a different approach and a
number of ways intuitively from what you

2855
02:30:21,371 --> 02:30:23,550
want to mass produce for consumption,
where you could just have, you know,

2856
02:30:23,560 --> 02:30:24,460
who cares where the cal,

2857
02:30:24,760 --> 02:30:28,000
it could all be the same cow clone that
you're growing the B from where every

2858
02:30:28,001 --> 02:30:32,050
human implant wants to be a immune,
uh, compatible with what you've got.

2859
02:30:32,050 --> 02:30:36,130
So the spinout didn't make as
much sense to me to say, well,

2860
02:30:36,131 --> 02:30:40,370
let's try to produce metric tons of
meat using that three d printer. Again,

2861
02:30:40,390 --> 02:30:41,500
any sense of a three d printer?

2862
02:30:41,710 --> 02:30:45,790
And I'm sure they're gonna figure
out some way to scale that up.

2863
02:30:45,791 --> 02:30:48,540
But I just felt like, to me there was a
definite technology risks there. Just,

2864
02:30:48,730 --> 02:30:50,320
I couldn't see the hand
waving argument says,

2865
02:30:50,321 --> 02:30:52,540
why is that gonna get a thousand
times better if for sure it could,

2866
02:30:52,541 --> 02:30:56,080
but I don't see why it has to. It
might not. Whereas this other thing,

2867
02:30:56,081 --> 02:30:59,380
growing cells in a VAT inherently scales,
it's like just have a bigger fat.

2868
02:30:59,381 --> 02:31:02,080
It's like it's three d to start with.
It's not a tutee lettering.

2869
02:31:02,380 --> 02:31:05,290
There's something about the manufacturing
method I guess that's been borne out

2870
02:31:05,291 --> 02:31:09,150
and things like brewing beer and in a
variety of fermentation tasks where you

2871
02:31:09,160 --> 02:31:12,760
kind of understand how to generate metric
tons of stuff with the fermentation.

2872
02:31:13,610 --> 02:31:18,610
For people listening like
myself who are not particularly,

2873
02:31:19,380 --> 02:31:20,213
uh,

2874
02:31:20,990 --> 02:31:22,950
I'm being generous,
not technically trained,

2875
02:31:23,680 --> 02:31:26,110
I'm certainly not an
engineer by any stretch, uh,

2876
02:31:26,130 --> 02:31:29,700
who want to make themselves
more scientifically literate.

2877
02:31:30,030 --> 02:31:33,540
Are there any books or resources or
approaches that you would recommend?

2878
02:31:35,110 --> 02:31:36,900
Yeah,
there's two things that jumped to mind.

2879
02:31:36,901 --> 02:31:40,260
One is the general purpose
overview of what's important.

2880
02:31:40,680 --> 02:31:44,010
Almost like a survey level where if
you're just a business executive and you

2881
02:31:44,011 --> 02:31:47,000
want to make sure you're not blindsided
by some development that may be relevant

2882
02:31:47,001 --> 02:31:50,010
than not be a practitioner. And then
there could be a question of, well,

2883
02:31:50,070 --> 02:31:52,980
is there something that like
let's say you're a farmer,

2884
02:31:53,280 --> 02:31:55,680
autonomous vehicle driver and now
you're looking for the next thing,

2885
02:31:55,681 --> 02:31:59,490
like what might you want to study to
engage in the economy as a practitioner?

2886
02:31:59,491 --> 02:32:03,990
And there are some areas that are more,
I think easily approached to another.

2887
02:32:04,020 --> 02:32:06,270
So on the,
so first than the overall survey,

2888
02:32:06,330 --> 02:32:11,330
I think there are some writers who do
a good job bringing you with a sort of

2889
02:32:11,790 --> 02:32:14,220
overview mentality too.
Like what's really going on in the world.

2890
02:32:14,221 --> 02:32:16,910
People like Kevin Cavey, Kevin Kelly, um,

2891
02:32:17,460 --> 02:32:21,950
and maybe Matt Ridley and maybe,
um, and a few others like this, uh,

2892
02:32:22,050 --> 02:32:26,250
going back with Hostetler and
good electric Bach. There's,
there's been a variety,

2893
02:32:26,460 --> 02:32:28,020
but I might highlight,
let's say Kevin Kelly. Yeah.

2894
02:32:28,170 --> 02:32:31,200
Because the single book that's had the
most influence on me and my entire life

2895
02:32:31,201 --> 02:32:33,180
is one of his earlier ones
called out of control.

2896
02:32:33,290 --> 02:32:38,100
And it really started my lifelong
fascination of the biological metaphors in

2897
02:32:38,101 --> 02:32:38,580
technology.

2898
02:32:38,580 --> 02:32:41,330
Everything from all that stuff we're
talking about earlier about selling

2899
02:32:41,350 --> 02:32:45,690
automata and iterative
algorithms and evolution is
itself an iterative algorithm.

2900
02:32:46,260 --> 02:32:48,930
The power of evolution, the power of
genetic engineering, all this stuff.

2901
02:32:48,931 --> 02:32:50,580
So he was ahead of his time.

2902
02:32:50,581 --> 02:32:54,540
He wrote this book last century and it
recently got translated to mandarin and

2903
02:32:54,541 --> 02:32:56,030
it's just in the current days,

2904
02:32:56,070 --> 02:32:59,610
one of those is probably the most
popular books in China today,

2905
02:32:59,611 --> 02:33:01,560
even though he wrote it decades ago.
Um,

2906
02:33:01,680 --> 02:33:04,500
because it's actually very relevant today.
So that'd be a good starting point.

2907
02:33:04,501 --> 02:33:08,850
I think it segues into the technology
that either as a practitioner or just you

2908
02:33:08,851 --> 02:33:11,310
can read about this. Um, if
you just direct yourself,

2909
02:33:11,340 --> 02:33:16,340
either simple Google searches or there's
the particular book I point out just to

2910
02:33:16,351 --> 02:33:18,240
learn about deep learning,
learning about, and y'all networks.

2911
02:33:18,300 --> 02:33:23,300
The reason I say that is I've never seen
a greater demand for a technology and a

2912
02:33:24,661 --> 02:33:25,740
scarcity of supply,

2913
02:33:25,770 --> 02:33:28,860
like the salaries being afforded through
the engineers in this area or out of

2914
02:33:28,861 --> 02:33:31,500
control, you know, half a
million dollars for beginners.

2915
02:33:31,710 --> 02:33:36,390
Who are some of the more credible thinkers
or practitioners who talk publicly

2916
02:33:36,540 --> 02:33:40,220
about deep learning? Uh, let me
think. Yeah, I'm trying to think.

2917
02:33:40,221 --> 02:33:42,360
There's a good overview that the places,

2918
02:33:42,361 --> 02:33:47,361
well I know that Coursera and some of
these places are trying and I'm Sebastian

2919
02:33:48,120 --> 02:33:49,320
runs a,
um,

2920
02:33:49,920 --> 02:33:52,800
you'd acidy are trying to do deep learning
courses and such as an intro and I

2921
02:33:52,801 --> 02:33:55,470
haven't taken those. I don't know how good
they, I would imagine even some of the,

2922
02:33:55,500 --> 02:34:00,500
the very technical people have given
non technical talks or whether it's at

2923
02:34:00,780 --> 02:34:05,360
Google or elsewhere. I would imagine
some of the thinkers that might be, uh,

2924
02:34:06,570 --> 02:34:11,520
in their day to day work way too technical
or specialized. I've probably given,

2925
02:34:11,730 --> 02:34:13,380
this is a tough one,
maybe for your show notes,

2926
02:34:13,381 --> 02:34:14,430
I can try to come up with something.

2927
02:34:14,431 --> 02:34:16,890
So part of the challenge I had is
because I started a phd in this,

2928
02:34:16,891 --> 02:34:18,850
I didn't seek the generic.
Right.

2929
02:34:19,210 --> 02:34:21,020
And I've been reading once in the
back of my hand, I'm like, well,

2930
02:34:21,021 --> 02:34:23,680
is that too technical? But I bet
you I can dig some up. Yeah, sure.

2931
02:34:23,770 --> 02:34:25,090
And it may sound self serving,

2932
02:34:25,091 --> 02:34:30,040
but I've tried to give some of those talks
and when I go to conferences a number

2933
02:34:30,041 --> 02:34:34,120
of times, there's a real dearth of other
people doing that same summarization.

2934
02:34:34,330 --> 02:34:36,790
But I would say that, uh,
the group out of Canada,

2935
02:34:36,820 --> 02:34:41,820
so everything from Hinton to Yoshua
Bengio oil to Andrew Ng who's coming back,

2936
02:34:42,821 --> 02:34:46,710
coming back to the u s in his
case they are both of you know,

2937
02:34:46,780 --> 02:34:51,220
leading edge of R and D and and such
and they give really good talks.

2938
02:34:51,280 --> 02:34:53,330
It's just not all of them.
Some of them are deeply technical,

2939
02:34:53,380 --> 02:34:56,980
some of them are overview.
So I'll try to find other for you.

2940
02:34:56,981 --> 02:35:00,940
Some examples of toxic gave that are for
the average person. Perfect. Perfect.

2941
02:35:00,941 --> 02:35:02,900
So that's, that's what we'll do.
Then the last thing I want to say,

2942
02:35:02,920 --> 02:35:04,270
but if someone actually
wants to get into it,

2943
02:35:04,720 --> 02:35:07,690
is it's actually remarkably easy to learn.
When I said it's weird,

2944
02:35:07,780 --> 02:35:09,760
the labor market arbitrage is,

2945
02:35:10,870 --> 02:35:13,990
I don't think it takes more than six
to eight months to become really domain

2946
02:35:13,991 --> 02:35:14,824
expert in this.

2947
02:35:15,100 --> 02:35:18,860
And you don't have to be spectacularly
good at computer science before you,

2948
02:35:19,060 --> 02:35:21,540
the background is, it's just so different
from normal computer science. Yeah.

2949
02:35:21,850 --> 02:35:25,540
That arguably a new entrant has a great
opportunity to just learn how these

2950
02:35:25,541 --> 02:35:29,650
things are trained and forget about normal
computer science. And you know, I can,

2951
02:35:29,651 --> 02:35:32,510
uh, I can say a few things
in response to that.

2952
02:35:32,560 --> 02:35:35,740
The first is to recommend
people check out.

2953
02:35:35,741 --> 02:35:38,770
So we talked about Tim urban a little
earlier and the tail end and so on.

2954
02:35:38,771 --> 02:35:43,180
So I had Tim urban on this podcast and
I asked him how he got up to speed on

2955
02:35:43,210 --> 02:35:44,870
topics and he went through his exact,
he just

2956
02:35:47,830 --> 02:35:50,060
laid it out to them, just calls
you call the guru on the mountain,

2957
02:35:50,061 --> 02:35:53,770
just calls you on the, for
those people interested,

2958
02:35:53,771 --> 02:35:57,100
if they just search Tim Ferriss show
Tim Urban, that'll pop right up.

2959
02:35:57,101 --> 02:36:01,420
And he spends about 20 minutes talking
about exactly this, getting up to speed,

2960
02:36:01,421 --> 02:36:04,450
which, which should be I think
helpful for a lot of folks. Uh,

2961
02:36:04,480 --> 02:36:07,570
and then in the show
notes at tim.blog/podcast,

2962
02:36:07,571 --> 02:36:10,960
you can just find this and we'll have
some additional resources for people who

2963
02:36:10,961 --> 02:36:15,250
want to include myself, uh, dig
into this and learn, learn more.

2964
02:36:15,790 --> 02:36:19,000
Uh, have you ever given a kid will be
maybe the last question or second to last

2965
02:36:19,001 --> 02:36:21,700
question. Have you ever given a
commencement speech? Oh, funny.

2966
02:36:21,701 --> 02:36:26,260
You should ask once for my high school
and it was the most terrifying thing I've

2967
02:36:26,261 --> 02:36:28,540
ever done. Like, like
I love public speaking.

2968
02:36:28,541 --> 02:36:32,600
I did debate back in high school and
when I'm speaking to an audience that

2969
02:36:32,601 --> 02:36:35,170
somewhat similar to the
audiences I've spoken to before,

2970
02:36:35,260 --> 02:36:38,920
check if it's on subjects that I've spoken
about before, check is my power alley.

2971
02:36:38,921 --> 02:36:41,050
I don't mind that.
Oh my God.

2972
02:36:41,051 --> 02:36:45,910
Trying to be relevant to a
bunch of 18 year olds. Uh Wow.

2973
02:36:45,911 --> 02:36:48,550
That was, that was back in Dallas.
Yeah. But I did that for years back.

2974
02:36:48,551 --> 02:36:52,690
What did you talk with? Did you talk about
what did, and maybe if, if it's broad,

2975
02:36:53,140 --> 02:36:57,070
what did people respond most strongly
to of what you told them? Oh,

2976
02:36:57,580 --> 02:36:58,670
I can actually give you the shownotes.

2977
02:36:58,740 --> 02:37:03,520
I managed to keep a copy and someone even
translated in Spanish. Oh yeah. Great.

2978
02:37:04,630 --> 02:37:06,460
So I'm trying to remember what it was.
I was trying to,

2979
02:37:06,461 --> 02:37:10,210
well here's it was the advice I got that
really helped was think about when you

2980
02:37:10,211 --> 02:37:13,900
were their age and the more time I spend
thinking about what life was like with

2981
02:37:13,901 --> 02:37:16,400
me, for me as a senior exes,
I went to that same school,

2982
02:37:17,150 --> 02:37:20,540
it all sort of clicked into place.
The, what do I want to do with my life,

2983
02:37:20,541 --> 02:37:21,800
what's going on in the world?

2984
02:37:21,830 --> 02:37:25,580
And sort of weaving what I was learning
from much capital and all the amazing

2985
02:37:25,581 --> 02:37:28,790
entrepreneurs that I was seeing to convey
to them like why you are entering the

2986
02:37:28,791 --> 02:37:30,350
most exciting period of human history.

2987
02:37:30,650 --> 02:37:33,660
And I shared a little bit about things
we spoke about on this podcast around

2988
02:37:34,040 --> 02:37:36,590
things going on in synthetic biology,
things going on in AI and what have you.

2989
02:37:37,070 --> 02:37:39,350
Each of these areas is
so rich with opportunity.

2990
02:37:39,650 --> 02:37:44,650
And I gave him some general advice about
just thinking about your career as a

2991
02:37:45,651 --> 02:37:48,680
pursuit of passion, thinking about
what you're uniquely good at,

2992
02:37:48,681 --> 02:37:51,140
that no one else in your random
walk through life may have done.

2993
02:37:51,350 --> 02:37:55,880
And to keep that in mind as you hopefully
infuse with a bit of technical open

2994
02:37:55,881 --> 02:37:57,830
mindedness and creativity
and childlike mind,

2995
02:37:58,550 --> 02:38:00,860
an exploration of what you want to do,
that they're just like,

2996
02:38:00,880 --> 02:38:03,770
it's no better time to be entering the
world and trying to make a difference.

2997
02:38:03,771 --> 02:38:06,350
I tried to encourage them a
lot to think entrepreneurially,

2998
02:38:06,530 --> 02:38:08,940
to think about being change
agents for the world.

2999
02:38:08,941 --> 02:38:11,860
That everything that history books we've
written about it is some new entrants

3000
02:38:11,890 --> 02:38:14,510
entering a field they didn't
know much about prior. Um,

3001
02:38:15,170 --> 02:38:18,620
and encouraging them that this is what
increasingly defines the world we live in.

3002
02:38:20,540 --> 02:38:20,900
You know,
one,

3003
02:38:20,900 --> 02:38:25,900
one question is somebody post to me
when I was considering the question,

3004
02:38:28,030 --> 02:38:30,100
we're considering unique strengths.
I was like,

3005
02:38:30,101 --> 02:38:33,010
I don't know if I have unique strengths.
I do a lot of things kind of well,

3006
02:38:33,310 --> 02:38:35,050
but I'm not sure. Yeah, maybe that's it.

3007
02:38:35,080 --> 02:38:36,490
Maybe it's the pattern
matching across those.

3008
02:38:36,880 --> 02:38:39,850
And the question that they asked
me was, what are, what are you,

3009
02:38:40,180 --> 02:38:44,170
what do you find easy that some that
a lot of your friends find hard?

3010
02:38:44,530 --> 02:38:48,870
And I was like, Huh. And that actually
ended up being very helpful, uh,

3011
02:38:48,970 --> 02:38:53,970
question for somewhat indirectly landing
on the strengths because I had a lot of

3012
02:38:54,491 --> 02:38:58,450
trouble with that. Um, so maybe folks
find that five is a good question.

3013
02:38:58,451 --> 02:38:59,050
That helpful.

3014
02:38:59,050 --> 02:38:59,230
Yeah,

3015
02:38:59,230 --> 02:39:04,090
because everyone does have
some acid element to that
question and they also have

3016
02:39:04,091 --> 02:39:07,500
something they've done that back to that
early question when I was in an venture

3017
02:39:07,501 --> 02:39:10,270
capital, well, how am I different from
every other venture capitalist who's,

3018
02:39:10,400 --> 02:39:13,510
you know, trying to do this job. There's
something about your personal background.

3019
02:39:13,511 --> 02:39:16,210
It could be a language
skill. It could be, wow,

3020
02:39:16,211 --> 02:39:19,270
you had to take care of an aging
grandmother in your youth and you,

3021
02:39:19,271 --> 02:39:22,060
so you have a sympathy and empathy for
what the age are going through that

3022
02:39:22,061 --> 02:39:22,860
others lack.

3023
02:39:22,860 --> 02:39:25,540
Like that actually could be a
superhero strength if you want to be an

3024
02:39:25,541 --> 02:39:30,190
entrepreneur for this aging demographic of
baby boomers, uh, not everyone. In fact,

3025
02:39:30,191 --> 02:39:31,810
very few entrepreneurs
think about the agent,

3026
02:39:32,790 --> 02:39:33,390
for example.

3027
02:39:33,390 --> 02:39:37,800
And I think you and your unique strength
can also be an unusual combination of

3028
02:39:37,801 --> 02:39:40,740
two strengths, right? I've heard
of Marc Andreessen talk about, uh,

3029
02:39:40,800 --> 02:39:44,850
layering public speaking on top of
anything else and separating yourself.

3030
02:39:44,880 --> 02:39:46,740
Warren Buffet would say
something very similar. Uh,

3031
02:39:46,800 --> 02:39:49,140
Scott Adams of Dilbert
famous talked about this.

3032
02:39:49,141 --> 02:39:52,350
Let's say you have an unusual
combination, right? So maybe you have,

3033
02:39:52,590 --> 02:39:55,620
that's exactly double degree and
then you have an Mba that's right.

3034
02:39:55,740 --> 02:39:57,570
And then you know how to debate.

3035
02:39:57,571 --> 02:40:00,390
You don't have to be the best at
the world at any of those things.

3036
02:40:00,420 --> 02:40:02,260
There's a lot of wisdom there
because it's that pairing

3037
02:40:02,310 --> 02:40:02,670
that,
anyway,

3038
02:40:02,670 --> 02:40:05,640
that's I think why most scientific
breakthroughs are interdisciplinary.

3039
02:40:05,670 --> 02:40:08,900
There are someone outside of the field
of chemistry working with someone maybe

3040
02:40:08,910 --> 02:40:11,630
in the field to come with a breakthrough,
not someone at the core of, again,

3041
02:40:11,640 --> 02:40:12,570
an academic discipline.

3042
02:40:12,571 --> 02:40:16,440
And this is why universities are such
areas of foment of innovation is because

3043
02:40:16,441 --> 02:40:18,720
they have all the disciplines
and the one physical campus.

3044
02:40:19,350 --> 02:40:22,110
But if you just had a chemistry
department or just the chemistry college,

3045
02:40:22,111 --> 02:40:24,180
it wouldn't make world breaking changes.
Right.

3046
02:40:24,181 --> 02:40:26,730
The people who figured
out the structure of DNA,

3047
02:40:26,731 --> 02:40:29,290
we're like an orange theologists and a
physicist, not chemists, right? Yeah.

3048
02:40:29,291 --> 02:40:30,270
Crystallographers we'll actually,

3049
02:40:30,271 --> 02:40:32,580
Roseland parks needs to get credit
and it was going to shout out to her.

3050
02:40:32,581 --> 02:40:34,620
So she's the traditionalist
in that regard.

3051
02:40:35,130 --> 02:40:37,470
But more and more people think about Elan,

3052
02:40:37,500 --> 02:40:41,040
not domain expert entering a new domain.
It's the cross pollination, right?

3053
02:40:41,040 --> 02:40:44,960
Being let's say software design with
LEDs to the aerospace industry or

3054
02:40:45,120 --> 02:40:47,700
[inaudible] Griffey into
personal computers. Exactly.

3055
02:40:47,701 --> 02:40:51,150
And so that pairing I think hearkens back
to one other thought that might bring

3056
02:40:51,151 --> 02:40:52,080
this whole thing full circle,

3057
02:40:52,380 --> 02:40:55,470
which is every great idea is
a recombination prior ideas.

3058
02:40:55,530 --> 02:41:00,180
This is a a really powerful and simple
idea that was popularized in three

3059
02:41:00,181 --> 02:41:01,440
different books at the same time,

3060
02:41:01,441 --> 02:41:04,980
which I think is Metta ironic that their
argument at the same time as every good

3061
02:41:04,981 --> 02:41:06,330
idea that happens around the same time.

3062
02:41:06,780 --> 02:41:10,140
And the reason that's interesting is
you can think in history of Edison and

3063
02:41:10,141 --> 02:41:13,500
Tesla and Marconi is like the time was
ripe given the breakthroughs that had

3064
02:41:13,501 --> 02:41:14,311
just having electricity,

3065
02:41:14,311 --> 02:41:18,270
magnetism to think about AC induction
motors and radio and everything else got

3066
02:41:18,271 --> 02:41:22,200
invented by all those same people are all
within months of each other today writ

3067
02:41:22,201 --> 02:41:23,700
large.
We have many more ideas.

3068
02:41:23,701 --> 02:41:26,310
We have the Internet allowing us to
cross pollinate ideas like never before.

3069
02:41:26,311 --> 02:41:28,950
These two things that are unique to you,
Paul on it together,

3070
02:41:28,951 --> 02:41:31,740
the calligraphy and the, you know,
computer design for jobs or what have you.

3071
02:41:32,160 --> 02:41:35,760
The number of possible pairings is growing
common editorially and I think that's

3072
02:41:35,761 --> 02:41:37,500
why we have accelerating
change technology.

3073
02:41:37,530 --> 02:41:40,220
That's why Moore's law exists
over such a long timeframe.

3074
02:41:40,400 --> 02:41:42,150
It's not because of the
semiconductor industry,

3075
02:41:42,330 --> 02:41:46,140
it's because the number of idea pairings
is growing as a to the end factor

3076
02:41:46,770 --> 02:41:48,870
called Reed's law with the
number of ideas and the planet.

3077
02:41:48,930 --> 02:41:51,930
And once you break down the barriers
between formerly discrete academic

3078
02:41:51,931 --> 02:41:55,140
disciplines and strip all that vernacular
way of their independent ways of

3079
02:41:55,141 --> 02:41:57,180
communicating with each
other that are so isolating.

3080
02:41:57,540 --> 02:41:59,070
And you see the common
patterns like wait isn't,

3081
02:41:59,100 --> 02:42:02,610
that's just like a information theory I
saw there and then my on the microbial

3082
02:42:02,611 --> 02:42:04,380
design front,
it's like then that same problems,

3083
02:42:05,070 --> 02:42:08,790
all these rich array of new ideas
is a sort of Meta reasonably,

3084
02:42:08,791 --> 02:42:10,890
you can't really quantify
how strongest would be.

3085
02:42:10,900 --> 02:42:13,350
We'll probably see more innovation than
ever before and it's not just because we

3086
02:42:13,351 --> 02:42:15,570
all will see more innovation than
ever before. It's because it's common,

3087
02:42:15,571 --> 02:42:19,800
it's real explosion of idea parents is
happening globally and oh by the way,

3088
02:42:20,100 --> 02:42:23,910
it's about to explode when the next 4
billion people come online and we go from

3089
02:42:23,911 --> 02:42:27,300
two to 6 billion people online because
of satellite broadband that space x and

3090
02:42:27,301 --> 02:42:31,500
others are developing. That's all coming
in the next five years. Like Holy Shit,

3091
02:42:31,501 --> 02:42:34,200
we're going to have a just explosion idea,

3092
02:42:34,201 --> 02:42:39,110
possibilities and innovation across the
plant. Exciting time to be alive. Exactly.

3093
02:42:39,210 --> 02:42:42,420
Especially when you have quantum
computers accessing potentially parallel

3094
02:42:42,421 --> 02:42:46,770
universes. It's right and where does
it end? It doesn't. Uh, well, Steve,

3095
02:42:46,771 --> 02:42:50,730
thank you so much for taking the time
and as soon as a really fun and a is

3096
02:42:50,750 --> 02:42:53,730
meandering is as the path I forged.

3097
02:42:53,731 --> 02:42:58,230
Hopefully you had fun as well and
to be continued. Hopefully we have,

3098
02:42:58,260 --> 02:43:02,850
we have many more conversations. Uh,
and I've saw any more questions for you.

3099
02:43:03,330 --> 02:43:05,220
So another fortunate for another time,

3100
02:43:05,340 --> 02:43:09,300
but where can people find you online to
say hello? See what you're up to? Sure.

3101
02:43:09,330 --> 02:43:12,910
So on Facebook I'm just username
Jurvetson and flicker username.

3102
02:43:12,911 --> 02:43:15,490
Jurvetson uh,
those are the ones,

3103
02:43:15,520 --> 02:43:18,640
that's the ones I like most of my old
writings or like the old stuff going back

3104
02:43:18,641 --> 02:43:23,410
2004 is mostly on flicker. And then
my social network addiction does your,

3105
02:43:23,411 --> 02:43:27,870
is Facebook and what is next
for you? What's next? Oh,

3106
02:43:27,871 --> 02:43:30,680
I'm going to start a new venture
fund some point this year. Um,

3107
02:43:30,820 --> 02:43:31,840
I haven't picked the name yet,

3108
02:43:31,841 --> 02:43:34,900
but I'm bouncing some ideas around
to focus entirely on purpose driven

3109
02:43:34,901 --> 02:43:38,050
businesses with really long timeframes
where we never sell a share.

3110
02:43:38,230 --> 02:43:41,440
At least I don't. And, um, we, uh,

3111
02:43:41,470 --> 02:43:43,930
we'll be investing in the kinds of
things we've talked about today,

3112
02:43:44,170 --> 02:43:47,140
companies that hopefully history books
we've written about companies whose

3113
02:43:47,141 --> 02:43:51,160
founders have a purpose greater than
their own life on this planet in a purpose

3114
02:43:51,161 --> 02:43:52,600
greater than certainly
making a quick buck.

3115
02:43:53,050 --> 02:43:56,410
And there are more opportunities and
more industry sectors and I've ever seen

3116
02:43:56,880 --> 02:43:58,000
but not as if he's seen the 90s.

3117
02:43:58,001 --> 02:44:00,820
It was like software semiconductors
in life sciences. That was it.

3118
02:44:00,940 --> 02:44:05,940
Like I never imagined I would invest
and just [inaudible] dot com [inaudible]

3119
02:44:06,340 --> 02:44:07,173
horribly wrong for a while.

3120
02:44:07,360 --> 02:44:11,270
Just balls and all being the
pinnacle or the Nadir of, of uh,

3121
02:44:11,320 --> 02:44:14,110
intellectual curiosity.
But now it's just a flourishing,

3122
02:44:14,111 --> 02:44:17,980
coral reef was innovation everywhere and
incredibly interesting tiny investing

3123
02:44:17,981 --> 02:44:20,890
startups. Well, can't wait to
see you do next. Thank you.

3124
02:44:20,980 --> 02:44:22,780
And to everybody listening,

3125
02:44:23,160 --> 02:44:26,740
there will be plenty of links in the show
notes including the things we promised

3126
02:44:27,160 --> 02:44:29,840
a resources to deep
learning and much more.

3127
02:44:29,841 --> 02:44:34,020
And you can check that out at
tim.blog/podcast and as well always.

3128
02:44:34,110 --> 02:44:38,310
Thank you for listening.
Hey guys,

3129
02:44:38,311 --> 02:44:42,180
this is Tim again. Just a few more
things before you take off. Number one,

3130
02:44:42,510 --> 02:44:47,430
this is five bullet Friday.
Do you want to get a short email from me?

3131
02:44:47,460 --> 02:44:51,630
Would you enjoy getting a short email
from me every Friday that provides a

3132
02:44:51,631 --> 02:44:55,170
little more soul of fun before the
weekend and five bullet Friday is a very

3133
02:44:55,171 --> 02:44:59,520
short email where I share the coolest
things I've found or that I've been

3134
02:44:59,521 --> 02:45:00,810
pondering over the week.

3135
02:45:01,050 --> 02:45:03,810
That could include favorite new
albums that I've discovered.

3136
02:45:03,811 --> 02:45:07,260
It could include Gizmos and gadgets
and all sorts of weird shit that I've

3137
02:45:07,261 --> 02:45:11,550
somehow dug up in the uh,
the world of the esoteric as I do.

3138
02:45:11,850 --> 02:45:16,850
It could include favorite articles that
I've read and that I've shared with my

3139
02:45:17,521 --> 02:45:20,220
close friends for instance.
And it's very short.

3140
02:45:20,340 --> 02:45:25,290
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness
before you head off for the weekend.

3141
02:45:25,380 --> 02:45:27,540
So if you want to receive that,
check it out.

3142
02:45:27,810 --> 02:45:32,460
Just go to four hour work week.com that's
four hour work week.com all spelled

3143
02:45:32,461 --> 02:45:35,610
out and just drop in your email
and you'll get the very next one.

3144
02:45:35,990 --> 02:45:37,710
And if you sign up,
I hope you enjoy it.

3145
02:45:38,550 --> 02:45:41,010
This episode is brought
to you by helix sleep.

3146
02:45:41,310 --> 02:45:45,900
Last year I committed to
making sleep a top priority,

3147
02:45:46,320 --> 02:45:51,090
trying to fix onset insomnia or
continuing to fix that depth of sleep,

3148
02:45:51,091 --> 02:45:53,100
quality of sleep.
I tracked a lot.

3149
02:45:53,101 --> 02:45:58,101
I tested a lot and I revisited really
everything from daily routine to the

3150
02:45:58,771 --> 02:46:01,540
surfaces that slept on, playing
with the chilly pad, whatever.

3151
02:46:01,740 --> 02:46:06,740
And when I moved to Austin I got all new
beds including mattresses from Helix,

3152
02:46:07,320 --> 02:46:11,270
working with the world's leading sleep,
certainly some of them he looked sleep,

3153
02:46:11,271 --> 02:46:15,230
develop mattresses personalized to your
preferences and sleep style to make sure

3154
02:46:15,231 --> 02:46:20,231
that you can have the best sleep
possible without costing thousands upon

3155
02:46:20,420 --> 02:46:21,201
thousands of dollars.
He looked.

3156
02:46:21,201 --> 02:46:25,160
Sleep has recently added a new layer to
customize sleep with the helix pillow

3157
02:46:25,510 --> 02:46:25,761
you all.

3158
02:46:25,761 --> 02:46:29,510
New pillows are fully adjustable so you
can achieve perfect comfort regardless

3159
02:46:29,570 --> 02:46:32,870
of a sleep physician or body type
or if you're a shifty type like me,

3160
02:46:32,871 --> 02:46:34,370
I move around quite a bit when I sleep.

3161
02:46:34,880 --> 02:46:38,840
Just take their simple two to three
minute sleep quiz to get started and that

3162
02:46:38,841 --> 02:46:43,220
will help ensure that they can build a
mattress or pillow that you will love the

3163
02:46:43,221 --> 02:46:47,390
mattress, whatever this be spoke
mattresses that you arrive at. Uh,

3164
02:46:47,420 --> 02:46:50,030
we'll get to you within a week and
the shipping is completely free.

3165
02:46:50,031 --> 02:46:53,540
You can try the mattress for 100
nights and if not completely happy,

3166
02:46:53,541 --> 02:46:55,430
they'll pick it up and
offer a full refund.

3167
02:46:55,940 --> 02:46:59,660
I tested that refund policy because I
test all of these sponsors and kick the

3168
02:46:59,661 --> 02:47:00,231
tires a lot.

3169
02:47:00,231 --> 02:47:04,670
We tested it and they came through on
making sure that we got ultimately the

3170
02:47:04,671 --> 02:47:09,050
right mattress for my body.

3175
02:47:25,760 --> 02:47:28,490
This episode is brought
to you by four sigmatic.

3176
02:47:28,520 --> 02:47:31,340
You might remember four sigmatic
for their mushroom coffee,

3177
02:47:31,370 --> 02:47:34,130
which was created by those
clever finish founders.

3178
02:47:34,310 --> 02:47:36,950
And when I first mentioned
that coffee on this podcast,

3179
02:47:37,280 --> 02:47:40,430
the product sold out in less than a week,
it lights you up like a Christmas tree,

3180
02:47:40,431 --> 02:47:42,950
which can be really useful.
However,

3181
02:47:43,280 --> 02:47:47,390
recently I've been testing the opposite
side of the spectrum of new product and

3182
02:47:47,391 --> 02:47:52,190
that is their Reishi mushroom elixir
to help me end my day to get to sleep.

3183
02:47:52,970 --> 02:47:55,130
As you guys may know,
longtime listeners,

3184
02:47:55,131 --> 02:47:58,790
at least I struggled with insomnia for
decades. I have a largely fixed that,

3185
02:47:58,820 --> 02:48:01,940
but still shutting off my monkey
brain has never been easy.

3186
02:48:01,960 --> 02:48:05,990
It still isn't easy very often and I
found Reishi which had been fascinated by

3187
02:48:05,991 --> 02:48:08,060
for a few years now has been very,

3188
02:48:08,061 --> 02:48:11,960
very effective and calming
their old formula, however,

3189
02:48:11,990 --> 02:48:16,850
four Sigmadek old formula included
Stevia and I like to avoid sweeteners,

3190
02:48:16,910 --> 02:48:21,910
all sweeteners for a host of reasons
and I then just ping them and asked,

3191
02:48:23,180 --> 02:48:27,440
hey guys, I would love to experiment
with this and maybe actually suggested,

3192
02:48:27,470 --> 02:48:30,860
but I'd like a version without
sweeteners if you'd be open to it.

3193
02:48:31,040 --> 02:48:32,150
Too much of a headache,
don't worry.

3194
02:48:32,540 --> 02:48:37,490
And they are always game
for experimentation and
so they created a special

3195
02:48:37,491 --> 02:48:40,010
custom version without the Stevia,
without sweeteners.

3196
02:48:40,340 --> 02:48:42,560
Now it is part of my nightly routine.

3197
02:48:43,100 --> 02:48:46,370
Their ratio looks or comes in single
serving packets which are perfect for

3198
02:48:46,371 --> 02:48:47,330
traveling.
In fact,

3199
02:48:47,331 --> 02:48:50,180
I'm about to leave the country right
now and I have a packet in front of me

3200
02:48:50,181 --> 02:48:53,660
that's just going to sit in
the end of my carry on bag.

3201
02:48:53,900 --> 02:48:57,680
You only need hot water and it mixes very,
very easily.

3202
02:48:58,310 --> 02:49:02,420
Here's some recommended copy
that they put in the read,

3203
02:49:02,630 --> 02:49:06,230
so I'm going to read it and I'll
give you my take quote, a warning.

3204
02:49:06,231 --> 02:49:07,770
For those in the experimental mindset,

3205
02:49:07,830 --> 02:49:11,280
Reishi is strong and bitter in
parentheses like any great medicine,

3206
02:49:11,520 --> 02:49:12,840
so if the bitterness is too much,

3207
02:49:12,841 --> 02:49:17,190
I recommend trying it with honey end or
nut milk such as almond milk and quote.

3208
02:49:17,670 --> 02:49:19,320
So I'm going to say,
no,

3209
02:49:19,410 --> 02:49:23,850
you should suck it up and you should
drink the tea because it's not that fitter

3210
02:49:24,270 --> 02:49:28,070
and maybe should take the advice of all
Chinese people when they're criticizing

3211
02:49:28,071 --> 02:49:30,570
young ins. When they
say, well, I'm sure cool.

3212
02:49:30,660 --> 02:49:33,030
Which means you're not
able to eat bitterness.

3213
02:49:33,090 --> 02:49:38,090
Bitter is in many cases and indication
of things that help liberty toxification

3214
02:49:38,761 --> 02:49:40,950
and so on.
Not saying that's the case here,

3215
02:49:41,010 --> 02:49:45,750
but I've tested this ratio,
Letcher on family members,

3216
02:49:45,751 --> 02:49:49,530
on friends, everybody has liked it. It's
a little bit or the, it's not that hard,

3217
02:49:49,531 --> 02:49:52,020
so I would just say suck it up and no,

3218
02:49:52,080 --> 02:49:56,220
don't put him honey or nut milk or any
of that shit. Just drink the goddamn tea.

3219
02:49:56,221 --> 02:50:00,030
It's delicious. I think if you like poo
air, that kind of stuff, that type of tea,

3220
02:50:00,480 --> 02:50:04,710
you're going to dig it. So just
try it. Okay. Back to then my read.

3221
02:50:04,950 --> 02:50:08,880
If you'd like to naturally improve
your sleep, both onset and quality,

3222
02:50:08,881 --> 02:50:13,881

enjoy this reishi elixir without any

3223
02:50:14,161 --> 02:50:18,630
sweeteners. It has organic, Reishi
extract, organic fueled, mint extract,

3224
02:50:18,631 --> 02:50:23,070

Tulsi extract, and that's it.

3225
02:50:23,670 --> 02:50:28,290

McCall it anything. So check it out.
