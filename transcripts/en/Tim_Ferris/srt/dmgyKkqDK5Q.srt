00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,180
Hello Ladies and gents. This is Tim
Ferriss and welcome to another episode,

2
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:08,510
God damn optimal.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:10,680
At this altitude,

4
00:00:10,681 --> 00:00:13,890
I can run flat out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking.

5
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:15,650
You posting a question.

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,090
I'm a cybernetic organism,
living tissue infoscope.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,590
That's the usual intro music,

8
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,210
but I'd like you to hear a brand new
version reimagined by none other than

9
00:00:38,211 --> 00:00:39,860
Justin Barreda of the glitch mob.

10
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,660
Whenever you find yourself
on the side of the majority,

11
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:47,000
it's time to pause and reflect.

12
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,200
This podcast is brought
to you by Mizzen and main.

13
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,080
Don't worry about the spelling.
All you need to know is this.

14
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,240
I have organized my entire life around
avoiding fancy shirts because you have to

15
00:01:30,241 --> 00:01:34,470
iron them. You sweat through
them, they smell really easily.

16
00:01:34,471 --> 00:01:35,640
They're a pain in the ass.

17
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:40,050
Mizzen and main has given me
the only shirt that I need.

18
00:01:40,051 --> 00:01:42,990
And what I mean by that and Kelly
Starr at loves the shirts as well,

19
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,270
is that you can trick people.

20
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,990
They look really fancy so you can take
them out to nice dinners, whatever,

21
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,170
but they're made from athletics,
sweat wicking material.

22
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,130
So you can throw this thing into your
luggage in a heap or on your kitchen table

23
00:01:56,131 --> 00:02:00,240
like I did recently, and then pull
it out, throw it on with no ironing,

24
00:02:00,241 --> 00:02:02,700
no steaming, no nothing. Walk out,

25
00:02:02,701 --> 00:02:06,660
and you could probably wear this thing
for a week straight or make it your only

26
00:02:06,661 --> 00:02:10,380
dress shirt and take it on trips
for weeks at a time. Never wash it.

27
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:12,480
It will not smell.
You will not sweat through it.

28
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:15,220
You got to check these things out.
So go to a four hour work,

29
00:02:15,221 --> 00:02:17,300

order one of their dress shirts in the

31
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:25,200
next week, you will get a Henley shirt
for free. That's worth about 60 bucks.

32
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,750
So put them both in the cart.
You use the code,

33

46
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:26,041
I s s or on facebook@facebook.com forward
slash at Tim Ferriss with two r's and

47
00:03:26,141 --> 00:03:30,130
two s's.
This is Tim Ferriss.

48
00:03:30,131 --> 00:03:34,090
And welcome to another episode of the Tim
Ferriss Show where I deconstruct world

49
00:03:34,091 --> 00:03:38,950
class performers to find the tools,
tricks, routines, habits that you can use.

50
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:43,300
And of course those experts range from
billionaire investors to chess prodigies

51
00:03:43,301 --> 00:03:47,800
to Arnold Schwarzenegger, to everyone in
between. And you do find commonalities.

52
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:52,060
And in this particular episode we delve
into a world that I know very little

53
00:03:52,061 --> 00:03:53,620
about and that is the world of music.

54
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:58,660
We have Justin Beretta who is a
founding member of the glitch mob.

55
00:03:58,661 --> 00:04:01,870
And if you haven't heard that name
or you don't recognize that name,

56
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:07,050
you will definitely recognize some of
their music and it could range from their

57
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,280
trailers and where the trailers
in which their features.

58
00:04:11,281 --> 00:04:15,020
So you could list sincerely to
edge of tomorrow, Captain America,

59
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:19,330
Spiderman to their commercial work.
So commercials for Fiat,

60
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:24,220
Audi and so on.
They also debuted their last album,

61
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,970
love, death and mortality incredibly
well on billboard number one,

62
00:04:27,971 --> 00:04:32,080
electronic album, number
one, indie labels, number
four, overall digital albums.

63
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,470
And this is fascinating because
from an entrepreneurial standpoint,

64
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,590
not only are they indeed are
not associated with a big label,

65
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:41,710
they're artists owned and
we delve into all of this.

66
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,700
How did they go from unknown to
on top of the world plankton,

67
00:04:45,701 --> 00:04:49,210
90,000 people in Quebec
with dead mass for instance.

68
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,530
We dig into the war stories, the
creative stories, the process,

69
00:04:53,531 --> 00:04:58,531
how that has been refined over time and
you get to hear some never heard before,

70
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:04,200
early drafts of some of their biggest
hits and Justin walks through exactly how

71
00:05:04,241 --> 00:05:09,241
those were refined over time to become
what millions of people now love and

72
00:05:10,931 --> 00:05:14,590
listened to all the time. It's a
fascinating discussion with an artist.

73
00:05:14,591 --> 00:05:17,890
Even if you feel like you have
no interest in music process,

74
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:23,070
you will find things ranging from his
schedule to his meditative practice that

75
00:05:23,081 --> 00:05:27,310
you can use. It's a really fun interview.
I hope you enjoy it. Without further ado,

76
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:28,990
here is Justin Burrito.

77
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,710
Justin, welcome to the show. Hey,
how's it going Tim? It's going well.

78
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,910
I appreciate you making the time.
And as a long time fan,

79
00:05:39,911 --> 00:05:42,340
I appreciate you making the
music first and foremost.

80
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,650
Oh yeah. It's my pleasure to be here.
I'm a, I'm a huge fan of, of all the,

81
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:50,160
the four hour empire as well. So it's,
it's an honor to, to get to talk to you.

82
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:55,330
And I know we, I guess initially connected
via Twitter. I think it was, is how we,

83
00:05:55,331 --> 00:05:59,150
we came in contact. Is that how the the
pieces came together? Yeah, I think so.

84
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:02,810
I think you, you had posted
something on sound tracking,

85
00:06:02,811 --> 00:06:06,680
which is a app that we both used and I
started following on there and then, yeah,

86
00:06:06,681 --> 00:06:08,600
we just kind of just
started chatting from there.

87
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:12,110
That had to be a year or two
ago. Yeah, yeah, it probably was.

88
00:06:12,111 --> 00:06:16,700
And then I've continued as a consumer of
music and now we finally have a chance

89
00:06:16,701 --> 00:06:20,960
to dig into the music. So the first
question I really wanted to ask you,

90
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,580
uh,
is.
