mile before my hands start shaking

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,090
does seem like

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:15,410
I'm a cybernetic organism living tissue.
I wasn't either.

I've used them for book covers,

10

Hello my darling little mark.

35
00:02:04,961 --> 00:02:08,270
Why this is Tim Ferriss and welcome to
another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show

36
00:02:08,271 --> 00:02:12,920
where it is my job to interview world
class performers from every discipline

37
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:16,850
imaginable. To tease out the habits,
the patterns, the belief systems,

38
00:02:16,851 --> 00:02:20,180
favorite books, whatever it might be
that you can apply to your own life.

39
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,760
In this episode is going to be
a slightly different format.

40
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:28,210
You will get to what I just mentioned
and it will be with one of the biggest

41
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:34,060
surprise hit guests that I've ever had
on the podcast and you wanted me to have

42
00:02:34,371 --> 00:02:39,371
him back on to pick up where we left
off and to ask the rapid fire questions

43
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,930
that are your favorites,

44
00:02:41,931 --> 00:02:46,931
which we didn't get to and that is the
purpose of this recording and he does

45
00:02:48,681 --> 00:02:51,470
deliver. His name is Adam.
So without further ado,

46
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,690
let's get into it.

47
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,770
Our guest today is Adam Robinson.

48
00:02:59,771 --> 00:03:04,771
You
can
find
them
on
twitter@iamadamrobinsonoratrobinsonglobalstrategies.com

49
00:03:06,071 --> 00:03:11,020
Adam has made a lifelong
study of outflanking and
outsmarting the competition.

50
00:03:11,021 --> 00:03:15,940
He is rated chess master and has been
awarded a life master title by the United

51
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,560
States Chess Federation as a teenager.

52
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:21,610
He was personally mentored by Bobby
Fisher in the 18 months leading up to his

53
00:03:21,611 --> 00:03:22,780
winning the world championship.

54
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,400
And Adam and I talked a lot about this
in our first conversation on the Tim

55
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,520
Ferriss show, what you guys can
check out, but back to the bio.

56
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,830
Then in Adam's first career,

57
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:36,880
he developed a revolutionary approach to
taking standardized tests as one of the

58
00:03:36,881 --> 00:03:39,040
two original cofounders
of the Princeton Review,

59
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:43,210
his paradigm breaking or category killing
as they say in publishing test prep

60
00:03:43,211 --> 00:03:44,470
book cracking the system.

61
00:03:44,471 --> 00:03:48,340
The sat is the only test prep book
to have ever become a New York Times

62
00:03:48,341 --> 00:03:51,160
bestseller. After selling his
interest in the prince interview,

63
00:03:51,161 --> 00:03:54,430
Adam turned his attention in the early
nineties to the then emerging field of

64
00:03:54,431 --> 00:03:58,030
artificial intelligence developing a
program that could analyze texts and

65
00:03:58,031 --> 00:03:59,650
provide humanlike commentary.

66
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:03,730
He was later invited to join a well
known quant fund to develop statistical

67
00:04:03,731 --> 00:04:07,990
trading models and since he's established
himself as an independent global macro

68
00:04:07,991 --> 00:04:11,560
advisor to the chief investment officers
of a select group of the world's most

69
00:04:11,561 --> 00:04:15,370
successful hedge funds and ultra
high net worth family offices.

70
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:22,350
If you could have a gigantic billboard
anywhere with anything on it,

71
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:24,060
what would it say and why?

72
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,740
Well, first Tim, thanks
for having me back.

73
00:04:26,741 --> 00:04:29,380
It's always a great joy and
a privilege and a pleasure.

74
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:33,520
I'll leave aside the danger of having a
text heavy billboard that would distract

75
00:04:33,521 --> 00:04:37,390
passing drivers. Instead, I'll
focus on four core quotes.

76
00:04:37,391 --> 00:04:42,391
I live my life by two by others and to
buy me first the two quotes by others.

77
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:48,550
The first is Rudyard Kipling,
if you did not get what you want,

78
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:53,290
it's assigned either that you did not
seriously want it or you tried to bargain

79
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:58,240
over the price. And the second
quote is immediately Earhart's.

80
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,700
The most difficult thing is the decision
to act. The rest is merely tenacity.

81
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:08,410
Kipling, an Earhart almost
capture the secret to achievement,

82
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,850
but we need to qualify them because
they can lead to obstinate persistence.

83
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:18,270
Either the goals or methods that aren't
working and because they ignore or

84
00:05:18,731 --> 00:05:21,880
dismiss the emotional
component of achieving goals.

85
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:26,620
So I'll add two quotes of my own and
the first, and I think this is my

86
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:31,780
favorite personal quote, if you're
not getting the results you want,

87
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:35,260
change what you're doing,
you'd think that would be obvious.

88
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:38,680
You think people of course would change,
they would pivot, but they don't.

89
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:42,520
They do more of the same. They doubled
down on what they've already done.

90
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:46,390
They try harder. Okay, so how
do you change what you're doing?

91
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:50,320
A good starting point is to take
a step in the opposite direction.

92
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:53,230
So if he's been spending a lot of money,
spend less,

93
00:05:53,231 --> 00:05:55,000
if you've been making
a lot of phone calls,

94
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:57,040
make fewer phone calls or none at all.

95
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:01,550
So these new steps might not work either
in which case change and change. Again,

96
00:06:01,551 --> 00:06:05,480
keep pivoting until you find something
that works and then do more of that.

97
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:10,640
My second quote is, if you experience
any negative emotion, doubt,

98
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:13,460
fear, frustration, anger,

99
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:18,790
it's almost always assign to redirect
your attention either to the task at hand

100
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:20,510
or do others.

101
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,680
Michael Jordan once said that he's
never thought about missing a shot.

102
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,980
And the reason he's never thought about
missing a shot is that it's attention is

103
00:06:27,981 --> 00:06:30,080
totally focused on making the shot.

104
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:34,130
So it would be wrong to say that Michael
Jordan was self confident about making

105
00:06:34,131 --> 00:06:37,880
the shot because the attention there
would be focused not on making the shot,

106
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,390
but on himself.
So self confidence in this sentence,

107
00:06:41,391 --> 00:06:46,100
it's almost as bad as self doubt. Your
attention is focused on the wrong thing.

108
00:06:46,101 --> 00:06:50,510
It's focused on yourself as opposed to
the shot you're trying to make or the

109
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:54,290
task at hand, whatever it might
be or the other, the other person.

110
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,860
So I've doesn't actually hundreds of
other quotes that resonate with how I live

111
00:06:58,861 --> 00:07:02,000
in my life, but for a billboard I
would confine myself to those four.

112
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:06,410
What are bad recommendations that you
hear in your profession or area of

113
00:07:06,411 --> 00:07:07,244
expertise?

114
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:13,270
My field is that of global finance and
virtually all investors had been told

115
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:18,230
when they were younger or implicitly
belief or tacitly encouraged to do so.

116
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:22,880
But I think cookie cutter curriculum's a
business schools, they all attend that.

117
00:07:22,881 --> 00:07:27,140
The more they understand the world,
the better their investment results.

118
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,610
It makes sense,
doesn't it?

119
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:32,300
The more information we acquire
and evaluate the air quotes,

120
00:07:32,301 --> 00:07:35,720
better informed we become
and the better our decisions.

121
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:40,220
Accumulating information becoming better
informed is certainly an advantage in

122
00:07:40,221 --> 00:07:45,050
numerous, if not most fields, but not in
the counterintuitive world of investing.

123
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,890
We're accumulating information can
actually hurt your investment results.

124
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,920
So in 1974 Paul Slovic,

125
00:07:51,921 --> 00:07:56,270
a worldclass psychologist and a pure
of Nobel laureate, Daniel Kahneman,

126
00:07:56,630 --> 00:08:00,020
decided to evaluate the effect of
inflammation on decision making.

127
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:03,500
This study should be taught at every
business school in the country.

128
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:07,640
Slovak gathered eight professional course
handicappers and announced to them,

129
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,900
I want to see how well you predict
the winners of horse races. Now,

130
00:08:11,901 --> 00:08:16,070
these handicappers were all seasoned
professionals who made their living solely

131
00:08:16,071 --> 00:08:18,610
on their gambling skills,
so love it,

132
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:22,400
told them the test would consist of
predicting 40 horse races in four

133
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:25,160
consecutive rounds in the first round.

134
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:29,360
Each gambler would be given the five
pieces of information he wanted on each

135
00:08:29,361 --> 00:08:32,630
horse, which would vary from
handicapper to handicapper,

136
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,380
one handicap or for example,

137
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:37,850
it might want the years of experience
the jockey has had as one of his top five

138
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:40,880
variables. While another might
not care at all about that,

139
00:08:40,881 --> 00:08:44,630
but want the fastest speed for any given
a horse that achieved in the past year

140
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,260
or the weight of the jockey or whatever.
Finally,

141
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:51,980
in addition to asking the handicappers
to predict the winner of each race,

142
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,910
he asked each one to also state how
confident he was in his prediction.

143
00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:01,350
Now, as it turns out, they were an
average of 10 horses in each race,

144
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:04,020
so we would expect by blind chance,

145
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,700
random guessing that each handicapper
would be right 10% of the time and that

146
00:09:08,701 --> 00:09:13,701
their confidence with a blind guests
to be 10% so in round one let's see how

147
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:18,540
they did with just five pieces
of information. The handicappers,

148
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:21,120
we're 17% accurate,
which is pretty good,

149
00:09:21,121 --> 00:09:26,121
actually 70% better than the 10% chance
they started with given zero pieces of

150
00:09:26,521 --> 00:09:28,830
information.
And interestingly,

151
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:33,860
their confidence was 19% almost exactly
as confident as they should have been.

152
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:38,700
They were 17% accurate and 19%
confident in their predictions.

153
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,230
Excellent calibration.

154
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:45,860
In round two they were then
given 10 pieces of information
in round three 20 and

155
00:09:46,891 --> 00:09:49,220
in the fourth and final
round each handicapper,

156
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,570
it was given 40 pieces of information.

157
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:56,130
That's a whole lot more statistics than
the five pieces of information they each

158
00:09:56,131 --> 00:09:58,440
started with.
Surprisingly,

159
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:03,680
their accuracy had flat lined at 17%
there were no more accurate with the

160
00:10:03,991 --> 00:10:08,640
additional 35 pieces of information
they had. Unfortunately,

161
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:13,790
their confidence in their predictions
had nearly doubled to 31% so the

162
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:18,780
additional information made them no more
accurate but a whole lot more confident,

163
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,170
which would have led them to increase
the size of their bets and lose money.

164
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:26,520
As a result,
beyond a certain amount of information,

165
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:27,870
a certain minimal amount,

166
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,790
additional information only
feeds confirmation bias.

167
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,320
Leaving aside the considerable cost
and delay occasioned and acquiring that

168
00:10:37,321 --> 00:10:38,154
information,

169
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:42,380
the additional information we gained that
conflicts with our original assessment

170
00:10:42,381 --> 00:10:43,214
or conclusion,

171
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:47,540
we conveniently ignore or dismiss
while the information that confirms our

172
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:51,770
original decision makes us increasingly
certain that our conclusion was correct.

173
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:53,870
So to return to investing.

174
00:10:53,871 --> 00:10:58,760
The second problem with
trying to understand the world
is that is simply far too

175
00:10:58,761 --> 00:11:02,750
complex to grasp and the more dog at
our attempts to understand the world,

176
00:11:02,751 --> 00:11:06,200
the more earnestly we want
to explain that's air quotes,

177
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:07,940
explain events and trends in it.

178
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,870
The more we become attached
to our resulting beliefs,

179
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,870
which are almost always
more or less mistaken,

180
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:19,160
blinding us to the financial trends that
are actually unfolding right in front

181
00:11:19,161 --> 00:11:22,040
of our eyes. Worse, we think
we understand the world,

182
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:26,630
giving us a false sense of confidence
when in fact we are almost always more or

183
00:11:26,631 --> 00:11:27,740
less mistaken.

184
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:32,480
You hear all the time from even the most
seasoned investors and financial expert

185
00:11:32,481 --> 00:11:34,850
that this trend or that
doesn't make sense.

186
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:39,050
It doesn't make sense for the dollar keeps
going lower or it makes no sense that

187
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,510
stock's keep going higher.

188
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:45,830
But what's really going on when investors
say that something makes no sense is

189
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:50,120
that they have a dozen or whatever reasons
why the trend should be moving in the

190
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:53,290
opposite direction. Yet it keeps
moving in the current direction.

191
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:57,850
So they believe the trend
air quotes makes no sense,

192
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,460
but what makes no sense is
their model of the world.

193
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,700
That's what doesn't make sense.
The world always make sense.

194
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:06,790
We just don't understand it.
In fact,

195
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:10,930
because financial trends involve human
behavior and human beliefs on a global

196
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:11,764
scale,

197
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:15,280
the most powerful trends won't make
sense until it becomes too late to profit

198
00:12:15,281 --> 00:12:19,540
from them. By the time investors
formulate an understanding, again,

199
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:23,380
a false understanding that gives them
the feeling of confidence to invest.

200
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:27,070
The investment opportunity
has likely already past.

201
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:31,900
So when I hear sophisticated investors or
financial commentators say for example,

202
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:35,050
that it makes no sense how
energy stocks keep going lower.

203
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:39,130
I know that energy stocks have a lot lower
to go because all those investors are

204
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:41,560
on the wrong side of the trade in denial,

205
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:45,400
probably doubling down on their
original decision to buy energy stocks.

206
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,970
Eventually there'll be forced to throw
in the towel and have to sell those

207
00:12:48,971 --> 00:12:51,460
energy stocks.
Driving prices still lower.

208
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:55,350
What is one of the best or most
worthwhile investments you've ever made?

209
00:12:56,010 --> 00:13:00,360
I've made many investments in my
life of money, of time, of energy,

210
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:02,880
of passion and emotion,

211
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:07,590
and one of the best payoff for the
amount invested was learning to meditate.

212
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,160
I've always been driven,
excited by the world,

213
00:13:11,161 --> 00:13:15,630
so my mind is continually racing at a
thousand miles per hour pursuing this

214
00:13:15,631 --> 00:13:19,560
question or that creating
this system or that nonstop,

215
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:23,160
24 hours a day,
365 days a year,

216
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:25,980
366 on leap years.
Now,

217
00:13:25,981 --> 00:13:29,820
all that nonstop mental and psychic
stimulation gets exhausting of course,

218
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,940
and if you want to perform
optimally at anything,

219
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:36,720
you need to find a way to recover
from the stresses of that activity.

220
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:42,300
So I knew that though I should find a
way to turn off my mind and air quotes,

221
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:46,380
just relax, just enjoy, just be.

222
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:51,900
For years I had failed to find
a way. I tried everything. Yoga,

223
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,750
exercise.
I even tried hypnosis.

224
00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:00,560
I researched once the best hypnotist in
New York City as a way to somehow turn

225
00:14:01,411 --> 00:14:02,760
off my hyperactive mind,

226
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:06,990
but after four attempted and usually
expensive sessions with this guy,

227
00:14:06,991 --> 00:14:08,520
the hypnotist gave up saying,

228
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:12,840
your mind is too active to submit to
the hypnosis will. Thanks a lot. Dark.

229
00:14:12,841 --> 00:14:16,290
I told I'm not concealing my annoyance.
That's exactly why I had come to him.

230
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:20,610
Then about two years ago,
my bestie, Josh Waitzkin,

231
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:25,640
recognizing that I couldn't unwind or
disengage from my relentless analyzing the

232
00:14:26,191 --> 00:14:30,780
world, especially in the financial world,
recommended that I take up meditation.

233
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,030
Sorry,
I said it doesn't work for me.

234
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:37,020
I can't sit still long enough for any
benefits of meditating to kick in.

235
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:41,460
So we asked, have you ever tried
heart rate variability training,

236
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:45,270
HRV training? And I said, no. What's that?

237
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:50,570
He said that you just focused on your
breathing using biofeedback to measure the

238
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:56,780
and the amplitude. Hence the word
variability of your heart rate.

239
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:00,050
The heart not surprisingly,

240
00:15:00,051 --> 00:15:03,470
registers all our realtime
emotions and stresses.

241
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:07,760
So the normal heartbeat is highly erratic
staying within a tight band around an

242
00:15:07,761 --> 00:15:08,600
average.

243
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,950
The goal with the VI biofeedback training
is to gain control over your own heart

244
00:15:12,951 --> 00:15:14,810
rate by focusing on your breathing,

245
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:18,890
making your Jagat heart rates
smooth out like a sine curve,

246
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,520
and to widen its amplitude.
That sounded interesting,

247
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:26,120
but it wasn't until I reframed
meditation that I submitted a trying it.

248
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:31,460
The problem with meditation I thought
was that it wasn't practical and worse.

249
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:35,240
The time I spent meditating was time.
I could have spent analyzing the world,

250
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:39,890
but I eventually reframe meditation
as a way to relinquish control of my

251
00:15:39,891 --> 00:15:44,891
conscious mind so that my more powerful
unconscious mind could take over and my

252
00:15:45,261 --> 00:15:49,400
analysis of the world would improve
motivated by that reframing.

253
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:54,430
I enthusiastically adopted biofeedback
HRV training and in a few weeks learn to

254
00:15:54,861 --> 00:15:59,480
quiet my mind after just a single
deep diaphragm belly breath,

255
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:04,040
getting the ability to achieve
a zen like calm on demand. Now,

256
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:07,850
whenever I need to detach from the world
or from the stresses of daily life and

257
00:16:07,851 --> 00:16:09,590
to allow my mind arrest,

258
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,920
I simply get centered and inhale from my
diaphragm and I do so numerous times a

259
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:19,010
day, a minute here, a minute there,
and at least once a day I waste.

260
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:19,850
That's air quotes.

261
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:24,260
I waste a larger 15 to 20 minute
block of time meditating in this way,

262
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,360
but it's not waste of time.
Of course,

263
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:31,361
since the increased creativity and
productivity from these many restorative

264
00:16:31,641 --> 00:16:36,641
sessions is far more valuable than
the time I spend being unproductive.

265
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:43,310
Again, air quotes. While meditating,
meditation is one of the most practical,

266
00:16:43,311 --> 00:16:46,700
powerful productivity
enhancing tools ever created,

267
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:50,660
and learning to meditate is one of
the best investments I've ever made.

268
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:55,760
What purchase of $100 or less has most
positively impacted your life in the last

269
00:16:55,761 --> 00:16:58,520
six months or in recent memory?
Well,

270
00:16:58,521 --> 00:17:03,521
this purchase is not less than $100 but
159 it is too close to pass up the heart

271
00:17:06,051 --> 00:17:10,880
math, inner balance, biofeedback,
monitor. It detects your hearts,

272
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,140
my nudist rhythms,

273
00:17:12,141 --> 00:17:16,730
and send a graph to your smartphone
facilitating HRV training.

274
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:20,870
And while you're at it,
get the book heart math solution.

275
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:25,370
In the last five years,
what new belief, behavior,

276
00:17:25,371 --> 00:17:27,890
or habit has most improved your life?

277
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:33,860
The understanding which has become a
habit that is most improved my life in the

278
00:17:33,861 --> 00:17:38,861
last five years dramatically
so is recognizing the
importance of others and not

279
00:17:39,711 --> 00:17:44,600
only changing the world, but in
enjoying it by nature. I'm an introvert.

280
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:49,690
So much so that some friends revealed
after high school that there were

281
00:17:49,801 --> 00:17:53,250
students, classmates of mine
who had never seen me speak,

282
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,870
not once in all of high school.

283
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,740
By the time I graduated from Oxford,

284
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,920
after doing my undergraduate work at
the Wharton school at the University of

285
00:18:01,921 --> 00:18:06,540
Pennsylvania, I had begun to emerge from
my interior world to a great extent,

286
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:10,620
but I was still 95 to five on
the introvert extrovert scale.

287
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,000
I very much enjoyed the company of other
people, but only for brief periods,

288
00:18:15,001 --> 00:18:19,740
1530 minutes beyond which I'd reach
overload and I need to seclude myself to

289
00:18:19,741 --> 00:18:23,190
recharge after college.
In my career,

290
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:27,240
my success in the world was the product
of my insights and imagination and

291
00:18:27,241 --> 00:18:28,074
thinking.

292
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:32,730
So I inhabited the world of ideas far
more than I did the world of people.

293
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:37,140
The more and better ideas I came up with,
the more success I achieved.

294
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:41,190
So it came as a surprise,
relatively late in life. In fact,

295
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,910
only in the past year that if
you want to change the world,

296
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:49,230
you have to enroll others in your
plans and vision. Not only that,

297
00:18:49,231 --> 00:18:53,070
but I discovered the immense pleasures
and satisfactions that can be derived

298
00:18:53,071 --> 00:18:58,071
from focusing on others and putting them
first and the surprising discovery that

299
00:18:58,321 --> 00:19:00,540
the more I gave to others,
which I'd always done,

300
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,120
the more the universe
gave me back in return.

301
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,710
Whereas in the past when I went
outside and encountered others,

302
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:12,090
I would invariably be lost in thought.
Now I am solely focused,

303
00:19:12,091 --> 00:19:15,990
not inwardly and my ideas,
but outwardly and connecting with others.

304
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:20,400
I mentioned this discovery publicly for
the first time in a live group podcast I

305
00:19:20,401 --> 00:19:25,080
did with Utm back in December,
2016 and was inspired shortly thereafter,

306
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:29,280
the right of book and invitation to
the great game, a parable of love,

307
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:34,310
magic and everyday miracles in which I
articulate my three guiding rules of life

308
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:39,030
first, whenever possible,
connect with others. Second,

309
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:44,160
with enthusiasm. Strive always to
create fun in the light for others.

310
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:45,510
And third,

311
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:50,780
lean into each moment and every
encounter expecting magic or miracles.

312
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:54,810
This discovery so profoundly
altered my life path,

313
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:59,190
revealing for the first time I true
mission on this planet then and now divide

314
00:19:59,191 --> 00:20:03,690
my life into two periods,
prediscovery of others and post discovery.

315
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:08,220
Now I so eagerly look forward to leaving
my home each day wondering what magic

316
00:20:08,221 --> 00:20:12,060
I'll create encountering others
that I can scarcely contain myself,

317
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:17,140
my days now have a natural rhythm between
introversion and extroversion that is

318
00:20:17,141 --> 00:20:19,390
akin to breathing when I'm alone.

319
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,740
I inhale my ideas and
then I exhale with others.

320
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:28,180
The number of remarkable people in
serendipities and successes that have come

321
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:31,270
into my life since I've adopted
this awareness of others,

322
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:35,680
which quickly developed into a reflexive
habit of directing my attention solely

323
00:20:35,681 --> 00:20:40,270
on them when I am not alone has been
nothing short of astonishing. So Tim,

324
00:20:40,271 --> 00:20:45,271
I have to thank you for inspiring that
book with that question at the 92nd

325
00:20:45,521 --> 00:20:46,061
street y,

326
00:20:46,061 --> 00:20:51,061
what have you learned this year and a
the book and invitation with the great

327
00:20:51,281 --> 00:20:53,800
game will be coming out soon in January.

328
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,600
What advice would you give to a smart
driven college student about to enter the

329
00:20:58,601 --> 00:21:02,710
real world? Yikes. I could write a
book in response to this question.

330
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:07,060
So instead I'll just toss out
a hodgepodge of observations,

331
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,390
truths, Maxim's, caveats,

332
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,920
and exhortations that I wish I had known
or at least fully appreciated when I

333
00:21:14,921 --> 00:21:19,150
just entered the real word myself.
Congratulations.

334
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:22,480
You recently left or you'll
soon be leaving an ecosystem.

335
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:27,481
You've known your whole life for an
entirely new one to switch analogies.

336
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:32,740
You're leaving a game you've played since
at least first grade with a rule book.

337
00:21:32,741 --> 00:21:34,090
You've consciously,

338
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:39,070
if not unconsciously assimilated and
more or less mastered for an entirely new

339
00:21:39,071 --> 00:21:41,440
game with no formal rule book handed out.

340
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,450
You'll have to write your own rule book.

341
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:47,530
You'd think the point of education would
be to prepare you for the real world,

342
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:51,970
but the real world is more unlike
school than like it. Indeed,

343
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:56,320
you'll find that many of the traits and
habits and behaviors that served you

344
00:21:56,321 --> 00:22:00,970
well in school, well either not work in
the real world or will work against you,

345
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:04,930
so you'll have to adopt an experimental
attitude towards everything,

346
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:08,530
continually testing what works
for you and what doesn't.

347
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:12,220
Graduating from college or leaving
behind your formal schooling,

348
00:22:12,221 --> 00:22:17,221
whatever form it took to enter the real
world is a major step since it marks the

349
00:22:17,441 --> 00:22:21,490
first time in your life when you'll be
making most of the decisions that affect

350
00:22:21,491 --> 00:22:26,140
that life rather than being told what
to do or being assigned what to do.

351
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:30,340
You won't receive a clear course
syllabus every few months detailing the

352
00:22:30,341 --> 00:22:34,510
assignments and exactly what is expected
of you and the standards by which a

353
00:22:34,511 --> 00:22:35,530
single person,

354
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:40,090
your professor will evaluate your work
and award you a single letter grade.

355
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,850
So I'll have to find your own incentives.

356
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:46,840
Another enormous difference is that for
the first time you won't be needing to

357
00:22:46,841 --> 00:22:49,390
navigate simply a cohort of peers,

358
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:53,470
more or less exactly your age and
from very similar backgrounds if not

359
00:22:53,471 --> 00:22:54,370
aspirations,

360
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:59,650
no longer now you'll be interacting with
a broad spectrum of humanity in all its

361
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:02,260
delightful but sometimes
challenging diversity.

362
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:06,580
So you'll need to acquire a whole new set
of people skills and ways to relate to

363
00:23:06,581 --> 00:23:10,540
others and cultivate what's
known as emotional intelligence.

364
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:15,790
So the rhythms of your life from the
daily to the weekly to the monthly to the

365
00:23:15,791 --> 00:23:20,440
yearly will be ones you established on
your own rather than the structures and

366
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:23,290
timetables dictated by the
academic calendar year.

367
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:26,950
You'll find this lack of structure
more or less disorienting,

368
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:32,020
and the more you develop routines
daily and weekly, at least the better.

369
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:38,080
Another recommendation,
instead of asking yourself air quotes,

370
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:42,670
what do you want to do? Ask
Rather, who do you want to be?

371
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:48,170
Whatever you're doing for work, whatever,
throw yourself into it wholeheartedly.

372
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:51,350
Even if you realize it's a transitional
gig while you search for something

373
00:23:51,351 --> 00:23:54,860
better.
Don't ever worry that air quotes,

374
00:23:54,861 --> 00:23:57,620
you'll be doing this for the
rest of your life you want,

375
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,800
but if that's your attitude,
you're missing out on the next point.

376
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:06,320
If there were a single
quality underappreciated by
recent graduates that will

377
00:24:06,321 --> 00:24:08,870
most ensure your career success.

378
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,730
It's not the obvious ones
like intelligence and good
habits and discipline and

379
00:24:13,731 --> 00:24:15,320
the capacity for hard work,

380
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:20,150
but rather this enthusiasm in all matters,

381
00:24:20,151 --> 00:24:23,960
be enthusiastic and others
will want to be around you,

382
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:28,880
including work with you and you'll
flourish. Unrelenting enthusiasm.

383
00:24:28,881 --> 00:24:31,910
I can't recommend that.
Strongly enough. Unrelenting.

384
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:35,180
As long as you're following
all the other rules here,

385
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:40,270
have patient's life moves at once much
slower than you expect and much faster.

386
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:44,270
You can be doing everything right,
paying your dues,

387
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:48,260
and for months or years it seems like
you're not making any progress and then

388
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,610
all of a sudden, boom, your life
explodes forward. At lightspeed,

389
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:57,140
Benjamin Disraeli said that the secret
to success was being ready for your

390
00:24:57,141 --> 00:25:01,610
opportunity when it presents
itself. Until then, pay your dues.

391
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:06,230
Your success in the world rests largely
on your ability to create compelling,

392
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:10,790
positive visions of the future that
others feel irresistibly drawn to be.

393
00:25:10,791 --> 00:25:13,970
A part of that goes not only
for your professional life,

394
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,860
but also for your personal and even
romantic life. As early as you can.

395
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:21,560
Try to connect to your personal mission.

396
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,940
Who are you here on this planet to be?
Mark Twain said,

397
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:30,080
the two most important days in your life
are the day you're born and the day you

398
00:25:30,081 --> 00:25:32,660
discover why.
I promise you,

399
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:36,200
the sooner you become aware of a mission
larger than yourself that you are

400
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,940
devoted to the exponentially more.
Yeah,

401
00:25:38,941 --> 00:25:42,340
more rapidly your personal and
professional goals will be achieved.

402
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:47,170
Find out what you love to do and do best
and cultivate that talent or talents.

403
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:51,580
Then be relentless and finding jobs or
situations in which those strengths and

404
00:25:51,581 --> 00:25:53,710
passions are most in demand.

405
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,930
No what your hammer is in a sense,
and then look for nails to hit.

406
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:04,510
The most important gifts and goals
in life, including love, success,

407
00:26:04,511 --> 00:26:06,910
and happiness are never achieved.

408
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:10,840
I want to underscore that never
achieved by pursuing them directly.

409
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:14,530
Those people focused on finding love,
for example,

410
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:18,700
have their attention and priorities
diverted from being the kind of loving,

411
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:22,180
lovable person that would actually
attract the love they're looking for.

412
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:26,560
And if your focus is on becoming
successful or wealthy or whatever,

413
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:31,830
your attention isn't focused on the
activities and tasks and others that will

414
00:26:31,961 --> 00:26:36,310
actually lead to that success
and wealth. Love, success,

415
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:39,010
and happiness catch you best by surprise.

416
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:43,740
While your attention is focused on doing
in the world and being your best in

417
00:26:43,741 --> 00:26:47,850
that world.
When you feel overwhelmed or unfocused,

418
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,300
what do you do?
When I'm feeling unfocused,

419
00:26:51,301 --> 00:26:55,800
the first question I ask myself is,
am I rehearsing my best self?

420
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,750
And if the answer is no,

421
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:02,780
I ask myself how I can reset each
day presents us with 86,400 seconds,

422
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:10,230
which means each day presents
us with virtually countless
opportunities to reset,

423
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:14,850
recover our balance,
and continue rehearsing our best selves.

424
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:19,650
If I realize my focus is off and certainly
when I'm experiencing any negative

425
00:27:19,651 --> 00:27:24,150
emotions, I asked myself, where
should my attention be right now?

426
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:27,150
Almost always the answer is my mission,

427
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,420
which is like a beacon
that always backends,

428
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:34,740
but sometimes I take on too
many commitments because
I sometimes have trouble

429
00:27:34,741 --> 00:27:37,140
saying no to others,
eager to work with me.

430
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:42,000
I can become a bit over committed and
overwhelmed. So when that happens,

431
00:27:42,001 --> 00:27:46,050
rather than attempting to do
everything badly, I ask myself,

432
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,910
what activity or commitment can I cut
out right now that will free up the most

433
00:27:50,911 --> 00:27:55,320
time? Reminds me in a funny way of this
new story I read ages ago about a small

434
00:27:55,321 --> 00:27:56,280
European town,

435
00:27:56,340 --> 00:28:00,690
I won't say what country lest I offended
unnecessarily in which the postal

436
00:28:00,691 --> 00:28:03,300
workers had trouble keeping
up with their deliveries.

437
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:06,180
So on Monday they do their
best to deliver the mail,

438
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:10,590
but they'd have some pieces
leftover, which they'd add
to Tuesdays delivery pile.

439
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:15,270
Tuesday they'd fall further
behind of course, and
Wednesday and Thursday for the,

440
00:28:15,271 --> 00:28:19,350
still by Friday they'd have an
enormous pile of undelivered mail,

441
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:22,680
which they burn.
So they could start fresh on Monday.

442
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:27,330
The process where we'd repeat the next
week, a small bonfire every Friday,

443
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:30,360
purging their delivery vans of
that week's undelivered mail.

444
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,780
Now that was a highly dubious
way of resetting each week,

445
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:35,040
which I don't recommend,

446
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:39,690
but the idea of having a fresh restart
whenever overwhelmed is excellent.

447
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:45,230
So let's say by noon on any given day
I'm falling behind and it's clear I'm in

448
00:28:45,661 --> 00:28:50,580
danger of becoming overwhelmed in short
order rather than attempting to keep all

449
00:28:50,581 --> 00:28:53,620
of my afternoon appointments,
which I'd reach later in later in the,

450
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:57,930
as the day progressed,
I scan my calender and I asked myself,

451
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,000
which is the earliest
appointment as it were,

452
00:29:00,001 --> 00:29:03,030
I can burn by postponing
it to another day.

453
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:07,050
I'd rather reschedule one appointment
and make the other three on time.

454
00:29:07,051 --> 00:29:10,200
Then be late and frazzled for all
four appointments that afternoon.

455
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:15,860
Speaking of which each week I leave
one day completely open and schedule a

456
00:29:15,991 --> 00:29:20,400
pretend trip out of the city so that
I'm not tempted to fill it in any way,

457
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:24,480
not even meeting with friends
or having other fund diversions.

458
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:29,190
Then if an emergency arises or I
fall behind and become overwhelmed,

459
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:33,780
I know I have a free day air quotes,
a free day to use anyway. I'd like.

460
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:38,010
So when I get overwhelmed trying to
juggle too many balls simultaneously,

461
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:39,210
I ask myself,

462
00:29:39,211 --> 00:29:43,930
which one or two balls can I sit for the
moment so that I can get caught up on

463
00:29:43,931 --> 00:29:47,530
all the others in the last five years?

464
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:52,240
What have you become better at saying
no to? This is such an important lesson.

465
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:54,400
Being able to say no,

466
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:59,970
it's especially hard for me because of
my inherent optimism and my unflagging

467
00:30:00,491 --> 00:30:04,810
enthusiasm and because they always leaned
into each moment in every encounter

468
00:30:04,811 --> 00:30:09,811
expecting magic or miracles and because
life has rewarded me increasingly with

469
00:30:10,121 --> 00:30:11,770
tantalizing offers.

470
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:16,570
So I not infrequently say yes too
often to my regret because I wind up

471
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:21,070
overloading my cognitive or physical or
energy bandwidths are simply run out of

472
00:30:21,071 --> 00:30:21,904
time.

473
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:27,010
So I found a powerfully useful editing
principle as it were in deciding whether

474
00:30:27,011 --> 00:30:32,011
to say yes or no to any particular
request or proposal or invitation where

475
00:30:32,111 --> 00:30:33,700
opportunity is answering.

476
00:30:33,701 --> 00:30:38,170
The following question will saying
yes to this option in advance.

477
00:30:38,171 --> 00:30:42,100
Any important goals in my life,
especially in my calling or my mission.

478
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:47,170
The key point there is to have
a personal mission in the world,

479
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,490
which will not only give you a stronger
sense of direction and structure and

480
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:55,780
energy and motivation personally
as well as professionally,

481
00:30:56,620 --> 00:31:01,620
but it's also a filter with which you
can decide whether to say yes to any

482
00:31:01,661 --> 00:31:05,560
particular short term or long term options
or opportunities that arise for you

483
00:31:05,561 --> 00:31:06,760
on any given day.

484
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:10,990
Keep in mind that the time
spent on pursuits and not
related to your mission is

485
00:31:10,991 --> 00:31:12,640
time that could have been spent on it.

486
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:16,210
Not that all your time of course
should be devoted to your mission.

487
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:19,150
You'll have other goals in your life,
personal and professional,

488
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:22,510
and sometimes you'll just want to goof
off or otherwise enjoying yourself,

489
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,180
but the sooner you
connect to your mission,

490
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:29,200
the sooner all aspects of your
life will fall into place.

491
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:34,710
What is an unusual habit or an absurd
thing that you love and the old television

492
00:31:35,171 --> 00:31:40,150
show? Candid camera reprise
by Ashton Kutcher, punk.

493
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:44,470
In more recent times,
unsuspecting people were videotaped,

494
00:31:44,471 --> 00:31:48,370
coping in realtime with an
insane prearranged situation.

495
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:53,260
Usually to great and suing hilarity.
I get endless little light,

496
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:58,410
covertly ambushing unsuspecting
strangers with random acts of kindness.

497
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:02,230
So for example,
after ordering my ice Latte,

498
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:07,320
I'll give a Starbucks Barista a $20 bill
and tell him or her to calm the person

499
00:32:07,421 --> 00:32:10,810
right after the person behind
me for whatever he or she wants.

500
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,450
And to give that person
that change as well.

501
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:17,530
I don't do the person immediately behind
me who might suspect that I was the

502
00:32:17,531 --> 00:32:18,670
mystery benefactor.

503
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:23,530
Then I set my latte from afar and watch
the confusion give way to smiles when

504
00:32:23,531 --> 00:32:26,920
the random beneficiary
realizes the unexpected bounty,

505
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:30,130
sometimes the person leaves
all the changes that tip.

506
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:35,140
Sometimes he or she will pay it forward
and gift the next person behind a free

507
00:32:35,141 --> 00:32:35,974
coffee,

508
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:40,720
but the beneficiary always leaves smiling
broadly and I know that I've unleashed

509
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:45,320
a positive ripple effect in that person's
community and to anyone he or she

510
00:32:45,321 --> 00:32:48,680
encounters that day.
I love spreading the magic.

511
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:54,210
Hey guys, this is Tim again. Just a
few more things before you take off.

512
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:57,180
Number one,
this is five bullet Friday.

513
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:00,420
Do you want to get a short email from me?

514
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:04,620
Would you enjoy getting a short email
from me every Friday that provides a

515
00:33:04,621 --> 00:33:08,160
little more soul of fun before the
weekend and five bullet Friday is a very

516
00:33:08,161 --> 00:33:12,510
short email where I share the coolest
things I've found or that I've been

517
00:33:12,511 --> 00:33:13,800
pondering over the week.

518
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,800
That could include favorite new
albums that I've discovered.

519
00:33:16,801 --> 00:33:20,250
It could include Gizmos and gadgets
and all sorts of weird shit that I've

520
00:33:20,251 --> 00:33:24,570
somehow dug up in the other
world of the esoteric as I do.

521
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:29,840
It could include favorite articles that
I've read and that I've shared with my

522
00:33:30,511 --> 00:33:33,240
close friends for instance,
and it's very short.

523
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:38,280
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness
before you head off for the weekend,

524
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:40,530
so if you want to receive that,
