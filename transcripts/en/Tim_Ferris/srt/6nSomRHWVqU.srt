1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,840
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02,841 --> 00:00:06,050
I can run flat out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,250
I'm a cybernetic organism.
Living

4
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,430
episode is brought to
you by a cent protein.

5
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,620
I am really excited about this discovery.

6
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:33,390
I became aware of these guys when I
found out that they'd spent five years

7
00:00:33,391 --> 00:00:37,860
trying to manufacture a better version
of whey protein and the result is

8
00:00:37,861 --> 00:00:41,010
something called native proteins,
which represents cleaner, pure,

9
00:00:41,011 --> 00:00:44,310
less processed protein.
So here's a mini tutorial.

10
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:49,200
There are only a handful of companies
worldwide that can extract native proteins

11
00:00:49,201 --> 00:00:52,050
directly from milk.
Traditional whey protein.

12
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,190
What you've probably bought before
is a byproduct of making cheese.

13
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,590
So a company must have the resources,

14
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:03,090
knowhow and a large customer
base to invest in extracting
proteins directly from

15
00:01:03,091 --> 00:01:06,900
the milk without the ability to also
profit from the associated cheese.

16
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,560
That means that net net is
native proteins are super rare.

17
00:01:10,561 --> 00:01:15,561
So a scent is the only us based company
that offers native proteins both way and

18
00:01:15,871 --> 00:01:17,880
my seller casein directly to the consumer.

19
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,880
They're able to do that because the
parent company Laprino is a huge cheese

20
00:01:23,131 --> 00:01:23,820
manufacturer.

21
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:28,110
They've been filtering proteins for
more than 30 years and there are few

22
00:01:28,111 --> 00:01:31,440
important things to take away from this.
Number one, zero artificial ingredients.

23
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:36,090
That is a solid claim. It's much
stricter than all natural. Number two,

24
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,040
they've done extensive testing,

25
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:41,100
so the chocolate which I've been using
after every workout and also in the

26
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:46,101
mornings was finalized after 282
recipes were vetted and the perhaps most

27
00:01:49,801 --> 00:01:52,170
important,
I talked about less processed.

28
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:57,980
They avoid steps like bleaching and
this is important to understand so it's,

29
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,850
it's a very big deal but hasn't
yet caught on for sports nutrition.

30
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,810
Traditional whey proteins are a byproduct
of cheese making. Like I mentioned,

31
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,320
many of the proteins are therefore
orange in color because they were sourced

32
00:02:10,321 --> 00:02:14,250
from say cheddar cheese production because
companies can't sell orange powders,

33
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,700
vanilla or strawberry, they have
to bleach the proteins, wipe this,

34
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,970
harms the proteins and leaves trace
amounts of bleach in the product.

35
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:24,900
That is no window, no good infant
formula companies, for instance,

36
00:02:24,901 --> 00:02:29,010
a banned the use of bleached proteins
already in their products and that is why

37
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,630
a sense parent company,

38
00:02:30,631 --> 00:02:33,990
Leprino foods is the number one
supplier of protein to infinite formula

39
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:38,520
companies. So all that said, if you want
cleaner, pure, less processed protein,

40
00:02:38,521 --> 00:02:43,521
which I certainly do and I'm
really excited to be using
this protein and I just

41
00:02:44,551 --> 00:02:47,490
ran out of chocolate, so I
need another bag, check it out.

42
00:02:47,491 --> 00:02:51,480
Go to a cent protein.com
forward slash Tim, that's a s,

slow carb diet or after workout.

46
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:07,810
This is a great option.
They also have my seller Casein,

Tim

50
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:20,370
this episode is brought
to you by four sigmatic,

51
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,570
founded by the Genius Fin's
who lit the Internet on fire.

52
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,420
And you may have heard
of their mushroom coffee,

53
00:03:27,421 --> 00:03:32,040
which features Chaga and lion's mane,
which has taken Silicon Valley by storm.

54
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,980
I use it pretty much every day,

55
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:39,920
either that or he chaga,
which is decaf as a separate version,

56
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:43,430
and I use both of these primarily
for focus and productivity.

57
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:47,810
They just get you going let
you up like a Christmas tree.

58
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,550
So definitely check it out.

59
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:54,210
People are always asking me what I use
for cognitive enhancement and for right

60
00:03:54,211 --> 00:03:58,860
now this is the answer. I try to
force this on all of my house guests.

61
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:03,240
It is a hell of a thing if
I have employees or people
come over who are working

62
00:04:03,241 --> 00:04:03,991
on projects with me,

63
00:04:03,991 --> 00:04:07,860
I always try to feed it to them because
I'm going to get the limitless effect

64
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,510
and get a lot more out of them.

65
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:14,550
The first time I mentioned this product
and four sigmatic on the podcast,

66
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,740
their product sold out
in less than a week,

67
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,960
so you may want to check them out soon.

68
00:04:18,961 --> 00:04:22,260
If you're listening to this and
the coffee tastes like coffee,

69
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,980
it takes just seconds to
prepare with hot water.

70
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:30,150
And oddly enough,
only includes 40 milligrams of caffeine,

71
00:04:30,151 --> 00:04:33,000
so it has less than half of what
you'd get in a regular cup of coffee.

72
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:37,380
I don't get any jitters, acid reflux
or any stomach burn, any of that.

73
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,750
It's very unusual and very,
very cool.

74
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,520
So if you don't like caffeine,
they also offer very strong,

75
00:04:44,521 --> 00:04:48,150
but caffeine free mushroom elixirs, which
I will sometimes have in the evening.

76
00:04:48,151 --> 00:04:51,570
I find Chaga specifically to be very,
very grounding and earthy.

77
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:56,190
So that is another option. And I have
a cupboard full of their products, uh,

78
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,930
at the moment, which is right
around the corner of my kitchen.

79
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:01,320
You can try something. You can
try a sample pack, which is great.

80
00:05:01,321 --> 00:05:05,790

84
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,410
If you are in the experimental mindset,

85
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:22,060
I do not think you'll be
disappointed to trauma.

86
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:29,150
You sexy little minx. Oh,
stop it. This is Tim Ferriss.

87
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:33,340
Welcome to another episode of the Tim
Ferriss show and a parent's sorry.

88
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,400
Have to define minx for your children
and listening in the car during the drive

89
00:05:37,401 --> 00:05:40,160
to school, but so it goes.
That's how the cards have fallen.

90
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:46,030
It is my job to deconstruct world class
performers on the show and we do that in

91
00:05:46,761 --> 00:05:50,930
many different areas.
Whether they come from say the military,

92
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:54,380
from entertainment, from
research, from sports.

93
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:58,610
You've can spot common patterns
and my is to tease out the details,

94
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,910
the philosophies,
the habits that you can use.

95
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:07,360
This episode features Bill Rasmussen
at bill underscore ESPN on Twitter.

96
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:10,760
I'll keep this short.

97
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,500
He gives where we want to jump right into
a bill is the founder of ESPN and the

98
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:19,850
creator of the 24 hour programming
cycle that all networks use today.

99
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:23,950
I was really excited to be able
to sit down with them and uh,

100
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,850
we really recorded a lot.

101
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:30,850
We recorded three hours material and only
one hour was used for my new TV show,

102
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,540
which I'm going to get to in a second.

103
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:35,330
And this podcast episodes
is almost entirely new.

104
00:06:35,331 --> 00:06:39,200
Exclusive content that did not
appear on the TV show. The TV show,

105
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,460
if you want to check it out,

106
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:44,810
is fearless with less in parentheses
because the goal is not to be fearless,

107
00:06:44,811 --> 00:06:46,790
but to learn to fear less.

108
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:50,480
Where I interview people like this world
class performance about how they've

109
00:06:50,481 --> 00:06:54,170
overcome doubt, fear, and
made their toughest decisions.

110
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,250

112
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:05,120
I highly recommend it.
Check it out. It's awesome.

113
00:07:05,121 --> 00:07:07,850
And he does a lot on stage and

120
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:31,730
So without further ado,

121
00:07:31,731 --> 00:07:35,900
please enjoy my wide ranging
conversation with Bill Rasmussen.

122
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,010
I'm your host Tim Ferris

123
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:43,510
stage.

124
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:47,440
We will be deconstructing world class
performers of all types to uncover the

125
00:07:47,441 --> 00:07:50,380
specific tactics and strategies
they've used, overcome doubt,

126
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:54,640
tackle heart decisions,
and ultimately succeed by show of hands.

127
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:58,960
How many people here wait for say the
morning paper to get their sports scores?

128
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,000
It's a big fat zero.

129
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:05,770
How many of you can remember
when television wasn't
available? 24 hours a day.

130
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:09,970
Anyone of my generation are a little
bit older. I've got a few hands.

131
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,330
And when I say Bristol,
Connecticut, what do you think of

132
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,210
after meeting my guest tonight?

133
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:20,590
You'll associated with one thing
and that is sports against all odds.

134
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:24,250
Heat set out to change the
course of television and
the status quo as we know it

135
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,390
and in the process he created one of the
most iconic and recognizable brands in

136
00:08:28,391 --> 00:08:32,830
the world. Please welcome the
founder of ESPN, Bill Rasmussen.

137
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:38,080
[inaudible].

138
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,300
What was your grandfather like?

139
00:08:48,301 --> 00:08:50,940
Describe for us your relationship
with your grandfather.

140
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:55,950
He was literally a dyed in the wool,
a white sox fan.

141
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,830
He took me to Kaminski
Park when I was very,

142
00:08:58,831 --> 00:09:03,390
very young and I can remember he lived,
if you're familiar with Chicago,

143
00:09:03,391 --> 00:09:04,190
35th Street,

144
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:09,190
it was 35th and shields is where the
Comiskey park was and he lived at 33rd and

145
00:09:09,211 --> 00:09:09,661
bell.

146
00:09:09,661 --> 00:09:14,310
I can remember these details like I
can't believe that they're there and he

147
00:09:14,311 --> 00:09:15,900
would walk me to the street car and say,

148
00:09:15,901 --> 00:09:18,180
now when all of the people start
getting off here at the Ballpark,

149
00:09:18,181 --> 00:09:19,920
like I would know where
the ballpark was there.

150
00:09:19,921 --> 00:09:23,310
It is right in front of me and I
can remember finding out early,

151
00:09:23,311 --> 00:09:25,110
and this was in the early 1940s

152
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:30,570
the ballpark would open if it
was one o'clock game and it was,

153
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,250
they opened the gates at 11 o'clock in,

154
00:09:32,251 --> 00:09:35,190
my goal was always to
be there to be one day,

155
00:09:35,191 --> 00:09:40,170
be the first one in the ballpark and
one day I did do it and my grandmother

156
00:09:40,171 --> 00:09:45,171
would give me a sandwich and a little
coke bottle with those little green

157
00:09:45,481 --> 00:09:49,050
bottles. I would take that off
under the rug, out of the streetcar,

158
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,350
a nickel or whatever it was to go on
the street car and get off Comiskey Park

159
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,600
and being there one day they were worried.

160
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:59,430
Red sox and white sox played
a doubleheader first game
when 13 innings and the

161
00:09:59,431 --> 00:10:01,140
second one went to the
bottom of the ninth.

162
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:05,630
Both games were seven to six and it took,
you know,

163
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:08,700
half a day to play all that.
I didn't leave.

164
00:10:08,701 --> 00:10:12,750
I was there from two hours before the
first pitch to the end of the second game

165
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:16,890
and that my grandfather allowed us how
at that point I became an official white

166
00:10:16,891 --> 00:10:20,850
sox fan. So anything allowed
as long as it's white sox,

167
00:10:20,851 --> 00:10:23,730
as long as it was the one lane as well.
And it was really, it's only a few blocks.

168
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:24,763
Yes,

169
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:29,100
I you're reciting these statistics.
The,

170
00:10:29,101 --> 00:10:32,160
for one of the first thoughts that jumped
to mind was you'd make a really good

171
00:10:32,161 --> 00:10:36,750
intelligence officer and then I
thought of something that I had heard,

172
00:10:36,751 --> 00:10:40,780
which was you played war games as a kid.
Am I making this up or did you have,

173
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:44,620
yeah, we used to, well, everybody
did. Okay. Every, I mean,

174
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:48,010
when 1941 occurred,

175
00:10:48,011 --> 00:10:52,840
I was in the fourth grade and before,
I think before Christmas,

176
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,150
we're all talking about everybody.

177
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:58,960
Everybody in America was talking about
we all have to be together though, or no,

178
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,930
right. Left up, down or anything.
We were all on the same,

179
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:05,570
same team and at the
early part of the war,

180
00:11:05,571 --> 00:11:07,960
before they started saying,
you couldn't do this.

181
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:11,380
I can remember my father's shirts come
back from the cleaners or the piece of

182
00:11:11,381 --> 00:11:16,381
cardboard in pretty much like they do
today I suppose in some some places and we

183
00:11:16,631 --> 00:11:18,760
used to draw whatever we want it to do.

184
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:21,850
If I was going to be a master sergeant
for the games the next day we would draw

185
00:11:21,851 --> 00:11:24,520
it on a board, then color
with crayons, you know,

186
00:11:24,521 --> 00:11:26,590
red and green and blue or whatever it was,
cut them out.

187
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:30,490
And with rubber bands we put them on our
arms and off we go the next day to do

188
00:11:30,491 --> 00:11:33,820
whatever battle we had decided we were
doing and we did that basically all

189
00:11:33,821 --> 00:11:35,050
through the war.
It was kind of crazy,

190
00:11:35,051 --> 00:11:39,020
but we had to start using
other things because uh,

191
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,920
hangars and cardboard, we're
all confiscated. We went out.

192
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:47,740
Oh yeah, they had everything went to the
war effort. We, we picked up newspapers,

193
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:51,400
everything went and was, we didn't use,
they didn't use the word recycle then,

194
00:11:51,401 --> 00:11:54,730
but that's what it was. They
were recycling and producing
anything. It's pretty,

195
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:55,430
pretty cool.

196
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:58,370
Do you remember where you were
when you heard about Pearl Harbor?

197
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,390
Absolutely.
What a picture.

198
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:05,320
55 south Mount Vida Avenue
and Columbus manner,

199
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,160
just south of 90 to today.

200
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:13,420
Back then 95th street was highway 12
and 20 on the south side. Chicago,

201
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:17,950
two lanes, one in each direction. Today
is 12 lanes, six in each direction,

202
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:23,980
but my happened and my father got
us all around the radio and we sat.

203
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:28,540
We sat literally on the living
room floor watching the radio,

204
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:33,140
listening to news reports, and we were
not unique. Happened all across America.

205
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:39,950
Also, if we flash forward just a little
bit to say high school and look at your

206
00:12:39,951 --> 00:12:42,830
experience in high school, you played
baseball. Did you try any other sports?

207
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,080
Oh yeah.

208
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,870
I tried football once because my father
encouraged me to do that because I was

209
00:12:46,871 --> 00:12:51,010
really fast. Had football, go
for it. Yeah, well I was so fast.

210
00:12:51,011 --> 00:12:54,940
One afternoon I intercepted a pass.
You wouldn't even,

211
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,120
maybe you would understand some of
the football technology of the day.

212
00:12:58,121 --> 00:13:01,000
We had defensive halfbacks and we had,

213
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,360
we didn't have all of these white
outs and slots and safe with them with

214
00:13:04,361 --> 00:13:05,111
different things.
Anyway,

215
00:13:05,111 --> 00:13:09,280
I was a defensive halfback intercept
of the past and because I was so fast,

216
00:13:09,281 --> 00:13:13,360
I went around very quickly. I didn't see
anybody in front of me and I thought,

217
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:16,180
what a great,
this is really going to be great.

218
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:19,360
Touchdown was insight and
I woke up under the bench.

219
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:25,150
Sweet. What happened?
Somebody was faster than I was

220
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:28,580
and when they were
faster than I was and I,

221
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,800
when it's not expected and you get
tackled from behind, I was literally late,

222
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:39,150
light out, game over football,
career over that was it done.

223
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:43,830
So did you, was it your choice to end
the football or did you decide, okay,

224
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:45,763
happen

225
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:47,571
and with baseball and,

226
00:13:47,571 --> 00:13:52,010
but then I did find out playing
baseball one day in a practice.

227
00:13:52,011 --> 00:13:54,230
We were just doing an inner
squad game and I turned around,

228
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,060
you know what the cardinal
rule is in baseball?

229
00:13:56,061 --> 00:13:59,120
Never ever take your eye off the
ball. Right. And if you're playing in,

230
00:13:59,121 --> 00:14:00,800
never ever take your eye off the ball.

231
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,800
I went like this one time and
turned back and that's all it goes.

232
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,810
And as I turned back,
I get hit right in the face of the baby.

233
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,700
And maybe that's why. Well,
no, we're not going to go away.

234
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,320
That's why I look this way today. I
think you look fine. I don't know.

235
00:14:13,321 --> 00:14:14,490
I think my nose is more quick.

236
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:17,220
The nearest maybe I got hit by a
baseball and don't remember it.

237
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:18,960
Actually I didn't actually know I did.

238
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:22,340
This is true because I
remember my first day, uh,

239
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:27,470
little league tryouts in deep in left
field fly ball right in the middle of the

240
00:14:28,591 --> 00:14:30,180
face.
That was the end of my baseball career.

241
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:32,400
That would be embarrassing
for an outfielder. Oh,

242
00:14:32,401 --> 00:14:35,280
it was embarrassing for anything fielder,

243
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:39,480
especially as whatever I was a third or
fourth grader is the runt of the litter

244
00:14:39,481 --> 00:14:42,660
as it was. And now I have lack of
hand eye coordination to go with it.

245
00:14:42,661 --> 00:14:44,360
It was terrible.
Uh,

246
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:48,490
tell me about a little
bit about high school. Uh,

247
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:52,940
in doing research,
I read about an essay contest,

248
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:56,530
the ended up sending you
ultimately to me suppose the,

249
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:59,750
the president or soon to be president.
Can you, could you describe that for us?

250
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:05,220
And I was a junior in high school in 1948.

251
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,210
Started my junior year that September
and there was a Chicago Sun Times,

252
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:15,980
had an essay contest for all students.
That six of from the city,

253
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:18,860
we're going to be chosen to go to a
president, Harry Truman, his inauguration.

254
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:22,970
That was the famous selection where the
Chicago Tribune and put out the headline,

255
00:15:22,971 --> 00:15:23,960
Dewey wins.

256
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:28,040
And then Truman held up the paper the
next day and his picture was in there

257
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:32,620
holding up the picture of the newspaper.
And of course do we didn't win. But uh,

258
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,250
the deal was we'd write
an essay and so on.

259
00:15:37,251 --> 00:15:42,020
And my father decided that I could
write an essay on becoming a lawyer.

260
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:46,760
I was going to become a
lawyer and I must've done a
really persuasive job on why

261
00:15:46,761 --> 00:15:51,650
I want it to be a lawyer because I was
one of the six winners and we got to go

262
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:56,510
to a Washington, we got to sit
on the, the capital, whatever.

263
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:59,060
I'm not sure what they call it,
but up there with all the dignitaries,

264
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:01,710
a senator Dayas or whatever
it might be. Well, you know,

265
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:05,930
it's where the senators and
the representatives were
included in that. And uh,

266
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:10,931
there was six of us and watched Harry
Truman take his oath of office in 1949.

267
00:16:12,001 --> 00:16:14,420
I got this, watch them take
the actual, uh, we were,

268
00:16:14,421 --> 00:16:18,110
we were right there in 1949 and
we went that night. Of course,

269
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:21,380
they have all these different parties
and one of the things that stands out,

270
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,030
we were all 16 year old kids.

271
00:16:23,031 --> 00:16:27,230
So we were chaperoned everywhere we went
and we were standing at the Shoreham

272
00:16:27,231 --> 00:16:31,430
hotel and I turned to my left and General
Omar Bradley was standing right there

273
00:16:31,431 --> 00:16:33,590
and he'd put his hands, said,
hi, how are you? You know,

274
00:16:33,591 --> 00:16:37,370
what are you doing here in the General?
Omar Bradley was a,

275
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:42,180
an icon to the people of that
era that was unknown. And I,

276
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:43,160
I've never forgotten that.

277
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:46,270
So we were able to maintain your
composure through all of that. I mean,

278
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:51,271
you get flown to the president or it's
going to be president being sworn in.

279
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,220
Then you turn,
you see an icon on the other side.

280
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:57,050
Were you able to maintain your
composure through all of that?

281
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:59,350
Yeah, I think I was just numb
through it all. I didn't even,

282
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,150
she didn't even register, you know. No,

283
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:04,540
I mean obviously I knew who he
was and then I was very, uh,

284
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,760
we were all very honored to be selected.

285
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:13,640
So you get to college and were there any
particular teachers? They're there too.

286
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:15,600
I've read about a history and Econ,

287
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:18,570
but were there any particular
teachers we had a large impact on you?

288
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,310
Um, the, uh,

289
00:17:22,311 --> 00:17:27,311
the one professor in economics financial
organization had investment was a,

290
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:30,560
he was the head of the
economics department,

291
00:17:30,561 --> 00:17:35,330
Doctor Joe me and he was an interesting
channel one to say the least.

292
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:38,120
And if you weren't paying
attention and he had a great arm,

293
00:17:38,121 --> 00:17:39,350
he should've been a shortstop.

294
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:44,060
I don't think these schools
exist this way today,

295
00:17:44,061 --> 00:17:46,970
but we used to have blackboard all the
way across the front of the room and all

296
00:17:46,971 --> 00:17:47,781
the way down the side of the room.

297
00:17:47,781 --> 00:17:51,480
And he would start at the class
over here at the left hand side,

298
00:17:51,481 --> 00:17:55,350
putting things up and talking
and on and on, lecturing.

299
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,950
And his suit would get all
covered with chalk dust and so on.

300
00:17:58,951 --> 00:18:01,260
And then he turned around out
of nowhere and he'd say, Tim,

301
00:18:01,261 --> 00:18:03,770
what about whatever the question was,
if you didn't get it,

302
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:07,680
he'd take that eraser and he'd hit you
in the forehead, hit you in the shoulder,

303
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:12,020
and then your mark was, if you came out
of the class with no chalk marks on it,

304
00:18:12,021 --> 00:18:16,110
who was a successful afternoon.
And I can also,

305
00:18:16,111 --> 00:18:17,640
just to put it in a little perspective,

306
00:18:17,641 --> 00:18:21,990
I remember the day the
Dow Jones average hit 3000

307
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:24,720
and you know how we used to get,

308
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,780
there was no online follow button.

309
00:18:28,781 --> 00:18:32,760
Minute by minute he would bring
in after the market closed, the,

310
00:18:32,761 --> 00:18:36,240
the Wall Street Journal would publish
everything in printed form and he would

311
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:38,820
bring that in the next day. And that's
how we learned about the stock market.

312
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,470
Crazy stuff.

313
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:45,740
And uh, was there another
professor who did reenactments?

314
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:49,900
Oh yeah, Andrew Crandall. Dr
Crandall. He was actually,

315
00:18:49,901 --> 00:18:52,930
he was a noted civil war
expert in the country.

316
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:55,780
And every year he would,

317
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:01,500
the only place big enough to
hold his lectures if you will,

318
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,150
was um, what's the name,
Mitchell Hall, the uh,

319
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:09,560
chemistry laboratory with all of the,
the theater types aits and down front.

320
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:15,120
And he would set up huge
tables and reenact the battle
of Gettysburg or whatever

321
00:19:16,361 --> 00:19:20,500
it was. And he had little, it
was like kids toys. Really.

322
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:25,560
He was so engrossed and he too, he would
start off with a shirt and tie and coat.

323
00:19:25,561 --> 00:19:28,630
And before long as the war,
as the battle progressed,

324
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:33,930
raging bull comes up and they
were standing room only lectures.

325
00:19:34,031 --> 00:19:35,080
It was just amazing.

326
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:38,890
People wanted to see because
he was entertaining but
so knowledgeable about the

327
00:19:38,891 --> 00:19:39,724
civil war.

328
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:44,910
And He created an awareness in so many
students about that period in our history

329
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,470
that I can remember it very,
very vividly. He was a,

330
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:51,640
he was an enthusiastic and a very,

331
00:19:51,641 --> 00:19:54,130
very knowledgeable person about it all.

332
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,730
And we talked about
Pickett's charge or Robert E.

333
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:01,600
Lee doing this and grant doing it.
I mean it was, it was incredible.

334
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:03,040
I never missed come on four years,

335
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,790
I seem to recall.
And you can,

336
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:09,640
you can shoot this down as
a figment of my imagination.

337
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:15,700
A stint as you had a lot of different
gigs and part time gigs that seem as a

338
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:19,600
collection to have really informed
what you did later at the ESPN.

339
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,690
Did you not have some experiences?
A weatherman?

340
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,590
Oh yeah. Oh, is that fun? And you,

341
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:29,000
and you started inserting things into
the weather. Well, what, what happened?

342
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:32,760
It's coming. Bear with us. So Mike,

343
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:37,160
let's talk about being, yeah,
yeah. I, well first of all,

344
00:20:37,161 --> 00:20:38,990
you had to understand why I ended up,

345
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:43,350
why I even ended up at the station
talking about being a weatherman. I, um,

346
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,970
lived in Amherst, Massachusetts and
there were, you have to remember now,

347
00:20:48,971 --> 00:20:53,290
this is in 1964,

348
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:54,610
1965.

349
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:59,380
We had two stations once NBC
station when ABC Station,

350
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:03,490
that's all a television there was. And
the entire western part of Massachusetts,

351
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:05,920
the NBC station had news,

352
00:21:05,921 --> 00:21:10,570
weather and sports from 11 to 11 or
seven to seven 30 and 11 to 1130.

353
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:15,700
The ABC Station at 11 o'clock just
did 15 minutes news and signed off.

354
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:17,830
So I said,

355
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:23,310
I'm not going to get the guy's job at
the one that does 11 hours a half hour at

356
00:21:23,311 --> 00:21:28,150
11 why don't I go talk to the station
managers at the ABC station and tell him

357
00:21:28,151 --> 00:21:32,260
he needs a sports show? It's
part of the confidence, I guess.

358
00:21:32,261 --> 00:21:36,610
And so I went and met him, call for an
appointment. He said, sure, come on down.

359
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:40,090
He said, what is it you want
to do? I said, well, the
other guys are doing sports.

360
00:21:40,091 --> 00:21:42,970
You should be doing sports.
Ah, we don't want under sports.

361
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:48,580
So we talked a while and he
said, well, all right. All
right, I'll pay a $10 a show.

362
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:53,260
I had to drive 40 miles to get
there. 20 miles, 40 miles round trip.

363
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:58,420
So taking that loss.
So it's a net loss. So,

364
00:21:58,421 --> 00:22:02,890
and you can start Monday. Okay,
well I knew I could do sports.

365
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:07,990
So I get down there and I'm walking in
the door on Monday, whatever it was,

366
00:22:07,991 --> 00:22:12,070
the 3rd of January, the 5th of January.
And he said, I've changed my mind.

367
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,790
I have you.
What do you mean you've changed your,

368
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:18,920
I thought I'd fired and I wasn't fired.
He said, you're going to do the weather.

369
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,510
We're not going to do sports. You're
going to do the weather. I said,

370
00:22:22,511 --> 00:22:26,020
I don't know anything about whether
shoveling snow doesn't qualify you to,

371
00:22:26,021 --> 00:22:28,810
you know, he said, here's the
way we're going to do the,

372
00:22:28,811 --> 00:22:32,830
whether you call Bradley field,
talk to the Noaa,

373
00:22:32,831 --> 00:22:35,380
the national weather people at Bradley.

374
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:39,380
Feel calm around 10 30 find out what
the world looks like around, you know,

375
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:42,250
this general area.
Scratch a few things.

376
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:46,210
We didn't have clay strong nines and all
of these kinds of things back then we

377
00:22:46,211 --> 00:22:50,320
had a grease pencil and a
whiteboard and write something down.

378
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:54,850
Draw a picture of Springfield if you
like or Massachusetts and just say it's

379
00:22:54,851 --> 00:22:56,830
going to be 68 degrees in rain tomorrow.
That's,

380
00:22:56,831 --> 00:23:00,940
that's all people are going to
get. So I can, and I can remember,

381
00:23:00,941 --> 00:23:03,340
and just to digress for a second visit,

382
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:07,720
some nine or 10,000 live shows a goal.
But this was the very first one.

383
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:13,500
I can remember when they said one minute
I turned around and put my back to the

384
00:23:13,871 --> 00:23:17,980
camera and the sweat running down the
center of my back. And I remember saying,

385
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:23,200
why am I subjecting myself to this?
And they turned said, you know,

386
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:27,130
10 seconds, five, four. I turned around
and I decided I really like this.

387
00:23:27,131 --> 00:23:28,120
This is pretty good stuff.

388
00:23:28,121 --> 00:23:31,880
I'm going to it to be telling people
about the weather. And I decided just,

389
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:35,980
I had followed the Springfield Indians
hockey team in the American hockey league

390
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:41,140
and the Boston Bruins and the rangers,
everybody in the area. So I said,

391
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:44,020
well, we're going to do is we're going to
find the weather from different cities,

392
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:47,150
especially where the
team was playing and say,

393
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:52,910
tonight it's a 32 degrees in Pittsburgh
and the white snow falling on the

394
00:23:52,911 --> 00:23:56,550
Indians won three to two and I
would just write three to two.

395
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,920
So I thought,
well this will get me fired for sure.

396
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:08,300
So you didn't ask this was a forgiveness,
not permission. Oh yeah, forgive. Oh,

397
00:24:08,301 --> 00:24:12,600
it's much easier to ask
forgiveness. So, uh,

398
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:13,430
that's what we did.

399
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:17,660
And the next day I didn't see the
general manager didn't say anything.

400
00:24:17,661 --> 00:24:21,810
So the next night I did a couple of
more scores and the next day I found out

401
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,660
some people call the station and
said, you know, this new sports idea.

402
00:24:24,661 --> 00:24:27,920
And whether they thought it was a, they
thought it was, I guess it was a plan Gig,

403
00:24:27,921 --> 00:24:31,640
but it wasn't. It just happened.
And grand collaborative innovation.

404
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:37,280
And then the
gentleman at the NBC station was promoted,

405
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:42,800
went down to Charlotte, North Carolina,
and before he left, because he had,

406
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:45,680
obviously we had met along the
way because competitors do that.

407
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:51,130
And he recommended me for that job and
in the things happen for a good reason

408
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,413
kind of thing.

409
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,740
I went up to that station and I was only
doing the weather and the sports for

410
00:24:57,741 --> 00:24:59,720
about four months.
And then I went to the other station,

411
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:01,790
the NBC station started doing sports.

412
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,940
And it happened to be in the year that
Mohammed Ali and Sonny Liston fought.

413
00:25:07,941 --> 00:25:12,230
And Louis did main pick fight and
his headquarters were in Chicopee,

414
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:13,783
Massachusetts.

415
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:18,850
And I was the guy able to go down and I
met him back then and we met each other

416
00:25:19,401 --> 00:25:22,130
several times after that.
But you never know.

417
00:25:22,131 --> 00:25:25,370
I mean here was a station
that wasn't doing something.

418
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:29,630
I talked him into something I guess or
they decided they were going to do it and

419
00:25:29,631 --> 00:25:33,440
then the other guy leaves and I get
his job and all of a sudden listen.

420
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:35,360
And back then it was Cassius clay.

421
00:25:35,361 --> 00:25:38,330
We're going to have this big
fight and I can tell you,

422
00:25:38,331 --> 00:25:42,380
and people who know Cassius
Clay, you know, pretty bum,

423
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,620
bombastic person,
and he was,

424
00:25:45,621 --> 00:25:49,250
we had a lunch in one day
and he was his usual self.

425
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:50,720
And then he said he was going upstairs.

426
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:54,830
It was a long way from where his
training camp was to the station.

427
00:25:54,831 --> 00:25:59,260
So I decided to stay there and I
just sat in the lobby and an hour.

428
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:00,260
So after lunch I,

429
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:04,310
I just kind of dozing off waiting for
the four o'clock press conference and I

430
00:26:04,311 --> 00:26:09,050
sense somebody sitting down over and is
Cassius clay. I ain't doing, what do you,

431
00:26:09,051 --> 00:26:11,570
you know, we'd said that we
talked for probably an hour,

432
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:17,840
normal tones just to just a great guy. We
were just, it was a young guy obviously,

433
00:26:17,841 --> 00:26:19,460
and we were,
he said,

434
00:26:19,461 --> 00:26:22,670
well I guess I better go up and we're
going to do this four o'clock writing.

435
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,720
And I was, they didn't call it that,
but I was called the question asker,

436
00:26:26,721 --> 00:26:27,620
the pool announcer.

437
00:26:27,621 --> 00:26:29,840
I was going to ask all the questions
and he was going to answer for every,

438
00:26:29,841 --> 00:26:34,730
for everybody. So as I'd seen little
wine. Yeah. Good. Looking forward to it.

439
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:40,400
A few minutes later, white
suit, white shoes, white shirt,

440
00:26:40,401 --> 00:26:45,140
white tie, big. Everybody. Wow.
Here he come. He came down,

441
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,840
he looked right to me.
Like he had never even seen me before.

442
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:52,650
Did his press conference with all
the usual bombast that he did.

443
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,890
And I've never forgotten that. And I
saw many years later and he remembered,

444
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,170
he put on a stage. So it on and he put
on a show. He was, but he was, he was,

445
00:27:01,171 --> 00:27:03,490
he was quite a guy.
I was privileged to meet him.

446
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:08,280
What's most, what were the most memorable
aspects of that encounter to you?

447
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,200
The fact that he could turn it on,
turn it off that way,

448
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,280
turn it on and turn it off in his
personality. And he was really, I mean,

449
00:27:14,281 --> 00:27:18,060
he talked just like you and I are
talking. It wasn't, it wasn't, it wasn't,

450
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:21,900
I'm the champ and you're just a guy here
in Massachusetts. It wasn't that at all.

451
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:24,930
And I never forgot that.
And I saw many,

452
00:27:24,931 --> 00:27:28,770
many years later and uh,
it was the same and it was the same way.

453
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:32,760
You mentioned something just a minute ago,
the things happen for a reason.

454
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:36,160
Is that a core belief of yours, the
things happen for a reason? Has It always?

455
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:40,800
Yeah. Sometimes. Maybe we make it
happen and sometimes it just happens.

456
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:46,580
If you had to say teach, let's just
call it, you can pick the grade,

457
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:49,070
ninth grade class,
college class doesn't really matter.

458
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:54,440
To help students develop confidence.
What,

459
00:27:54,441 --> 00:27:56,510
how would you approach that or
how would you even think about it?

460
00:27:56,670 --> 00:28:00,480
Are there any, you know, a lot of
people ask me that question and I'm not,

461
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:01,830
this is going to sound odd.

462
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:06,860
I'm not sure I'm qualified to do that
in the form of a college curriculum,

463
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:14,180
but if I can somehow transmit that
belief and the feeling of success and

464
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:20,370
positive approach to things that you
have to have and be able to take the

465
00:28:20,371 --> 00:28:21,990
negatives and get past them.

466
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:26,370
And I don't know how you'd do that in
a college curriculum, but it's, I just,

467
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:30,930
you know, whether it's stealing bases
or selling products or whatever.

468
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,770
As I said earlier,
I think that when somebody says no,

469
00:28:34,771 --> 00:28:37,950
they've made the mistake and I don't,
I don't know how you,

470
00:28:37,951 --> 00:28:39,150
I don't know how I would do that.

471
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,620
The other leg of the table,
it seems as advertising,

472
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:47,940
so you shortly, while, I don't
know if it was shortly after,

473
00:28:47,941 --> 00:28:50,640
but after getting the NCAA to commit,

474
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,570
we were a little ahead of that little
ad. Yeah, we were. We were floating them.

475
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:58,080
They were one of the,
so we told them who we were talking to.

476
00:28:58,081 --> 00:29:02,700
We didn't tell them we had them.
This is a well known beer company,

477
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:06,690
Spas. It is. And so can you tell
us a little bit about how that was,

478
00:29:06,691 --> 00:29:08,850
was that happening concurrently?
Was that another ball in the air?

479
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:14,610
That was happening in early January.
Okay. We had hired as an advertiser Bush.

480
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,100
Yeah.
We had hired a gentleman from Connecticut,

481
00:29:17,101 --> 00:29:19,140
general insurance to be
our general sales manager.

482
00:29:19,141 --> 00:29:23,250
He was the general sales manager.
They're like the sports idea and I said,

483
00:29:23,251 --> 00:29:23,850
we have to,

484
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:28,850
obviously the obvious choice is Anheuser
Busch largest sports advertiser in the

485
00:29:29,071 --> 00:29:30,780
world. Then and maybe today, I don't know,

486
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:35,370
but we had a very specific
plan to take them.

487
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:38,940
That sounds odd when I say all these
other vagaries that we're just juggling,

488
00:29:38,941 --> 00:29:43,540
but we had a very specific
plan. We decided that if we
could get eight sponsors,

489
00:29:43,541 --> 00:29:46,270
a 2 million,
$760,000 a year,

490
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,220
that would finance total of the sum
total of the eight sponsors? No, no.

491
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:55,060
Total eight times. So it'd be
20 $20 million. Got It. Got It.

492
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:59,470
So we, uh, went down to New York,

493
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:03,460
got invited down to Darcy
Mcmanus and the vice president,

494
00:30:03,461 --> 00:30:06,340
Jane Patrola was his name and
he listened and he was a trig.

495
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:10,660
He has to be intrigued. It's his business
sports business, Budweiser. He said,

496
00:30:10,661 --> 00:30:14,780
I'll take it to the brewery, I'll get
back to you a couple of days later.

497
00:30:14,781 --> 00:30:16,300
And we went back down
to New York and he said,

498
00:30:16,301 --> 00:30:18,460
I've been to the brewery
will give you a $500,000.

499
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:23,020
That's the first sign we ever had of
any money coming our way are 9,000 have

500
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:27,580
gone out the door. My family and friends
had gone out the door, k a suite of,

501
00:30:27,581 --> 00:30:30,340
puts the money in and we were, we were
running on just the first black ink,

502
00:30:30,341 --> 00:30:31,600
like real influences.
Yeah.

503
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:36,100
And Bob and I looked at each other
and we shook our heads and said,

504
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:39,950
and this just, I was sitting right
the way I'm sitting with you, Tim.

505
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:42,530
And as you know in New York out windows,

506
00:30:42,531 --> 00:30:46,090
they're advertising things
on the sides of buildings,

507
00:30:46,091 --> 00:30:48,220
on the front of buildings
and mark keys and everywhere.

508
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,350
And it just so happened over jeans.

509
00:30:50,351 --> 00:30:55,351
Left shoulder was a big ad
for Miller Miller high life.

510
00:30:56,770 --> 00:31:01,120
And I looked at Bob and he looked at me
and I took my eyes from gene and I said,

511
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:03,850
we can't accept that and we were
going to have to pursue other avenues.

512
00:31:03,851 --> 00:31:07,300
And I just looked over that way. And
he said, before you do that, he knew,

513
00:31:07,301 --> 00:31:12,250
he knew what ad was out the window.
He said, let me have an exact word,

514
00:31:12,251 --> 00:31:16,120
let me have another go at the brewery.
He called a couple days later and he said,

515
00:31:16,121 --> 00:31:19,360
I'll tell you what, nobody's ever
done this and cable television,

516
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:23,650
we'll give you a million,
$380,000 and let's go.

517
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,150
And that's the way it was.

518
00:31:25,151 --> 00:31:28,750
So we had 1,000,380 committed before
we had the programming committee.

519
00:31:28,751 --> 00:31:32,680
And then before we had the financing
committed, which is kind of, you know,

520
00:31:32,681 --> 00:31:34,960
when all the eggs are running and it
doesn't make any difference which order

521
00:31:34,961 --> 00:31:36,130
they come in just to get them home.

522
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:41,660
What were some of the
more say, costly, uh,

523
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:46,180
decisions or missteps that
you guys had early on? Um,

524
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:49,960
there had to been something I
would have been, yeah, well we did,

525
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:53,080
we did Canadian football.
We tried to do some,

526
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:55,360
we tried to do a lot of
different things with different,

527
00:31:55,370 --> 00:32:00,040
we always tried to overreach.
And even to this day, uh,

528
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:04,780
just a couple of years ago, I was
in, uh, Dallas talking to ESPN radio,

529
00:32:04,781 --> 00:32:08,920
which by the way is now the biggest
radio network. You know, it's just crazy.

530
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:10,330
Uh,

531
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:15,330
and I asked that very same question about
what happens in what are the mistakes?

532
00:32:15,341 --> 00:32:18,310
And this fellow had worked
for ABC and so I said,

533
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:22,210
what's the difference between the
two same market? He worked for ABC,

534
00:32:22,211 --> 00:32:26,320
now he's working for ESPN
because obviously they were
all bought by Disney and

535
00:32:26,321 --> 00:32:29,800
they're all in the same
house, so to speak. He said,

536
00:32:29,801 --> 00:32:33,340
ABC always sent out
directives to us saying,

537
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:37,480
don't rock the boat. We're doing well
in this market. We're doing well here.

538
00:32:37,481 --> 00:32:41,600
We're doing all these, they don't rock
the boat. He, ESPN on the other hand says,

539
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:45,740
try everything that pops into your
mind. If it works, great. If it doesn't,

540
00:32:45,741 --> 00:32:49,940
forget it and move on.
Two totally different approaches.

541
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:53,850
Sounds like the bill Rasmussen got into
life. That's like the mantra, right?

542
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:56,170
Well, but eh, but if we think about that,

543
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:59,470
how discouraging it would
be to your employees to say,

544
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,650
I don't want you to come in and telling
me anything. He might have a greater,

545
00:33:02,651 --> 00:33:05,590
I don't want to hear your great idea
after you've given them an opportunity to

546
00:33:05,591 --> 00:33:09,910
work for you. Now you don't want to hear
from him. So encourage everybody in,

547
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,360
but let's do it all. And if
you met someone, if he mess up,

548
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:16,330
nobody's going to shoot you and there's
no debtor's jail. There's no, you know,

549
00:33:16,331 --> 00:33:19,690
no guillotine. This
isn't whatever. And uh,

550
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:24,400
I thought that was interesting from them.
They've tried a number of things.

551
00:33:24,401 --> 00:33:27,700
We did a thing with, uh,
not when I was there,

552
00:33:27,701 --> 00:33:31,450
but with a cell phones.
When they first came in,

553
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:35,650
there was some gigantic program when
they were testing it with kids of all the

554
00:33:35,651 --> 00:33:38,500
employees and everything else.
And it didn't work.

555
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,620
So they just moved on.
Of course,

556
00:33:41,621 --> 00:33:44,710
they've changed that around a little bit
now with streaming and everything else

557
00:33:44,711 --> 00:33:47,440
in cell phones today of course a little
different than they were 10 years ago.

558
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:50,170
Did we even have cell phones 10 years ago?
I don't even remember.

559
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:54,570
We did. They just, they were closer
to the Gordon Gekko. Yeah, Rick.

560
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:58,700
Uh, okay. But yes, we did have the,

561
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:01,330
what I'd love to do because
we're talking about,

562
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:05,520
of course ESPN arguably your
best known for that. Uh,

563
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:08,380
but to sort of bring it
full circle for a second,

564
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:13,060
we're going to bring out a prop.
It's not really a prop. This is,

565
00:34:13,061 --> 00:34:15,850
this is a real, it's a
real thing. A real thing.

566
00:34:15,851 --> 00:34:17,930
I don't want to spoil the surprise,
so we're going to get that.

567
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:18,764
That's going to come out.

568
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:23,910
But I thought we might do if the team in
the back can bring up the then and now

569
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,340
some of the stats,

570
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:31,660
because you mentioned radio and I just
thought just to put this in perspective

571
00:34:31,661 --> 00:34:36,661
for people starting with Irish hurling
and juggling five different balls,

572
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:38,163
telling everyone,

573
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:42,340
each person that everyone else is in
until ultimately you get them all in.

574
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:46,990
I think it's pretty staggering when
you look at the before and after and

575
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:51,040
if you, so I'm not going to read
all of these stats for you guys.

576
00:34:51,041 --> 00:34:54,940
We can see subscribers and 1.3
million to more than 90 million,

577
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:56,223
80 employees,

578
00:34:56,590 --> 00:35:00,940
more than 8,000 than one
acre just in Bristol alone,

579
00:35:00,941 --> 00:35:02,500
223 radio,

580
00:35:02,501 --> 00:35:06,250
none to 20 million and that's not
even counting the publishing arm.

581
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:09,880
No huge magazine and everything else.

582
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:13,600
Yeah,
it's an amazing their subscriber fees.

583
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:18,880
This is a staggering number to me.
We started off asking for a penny,

584
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:22,090
one penny at it, would you pay me,
Tim if I came to and I said, Tim,

585
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:26,830
give me a penny day, 30 cents a month
and you can watch sports 24 hours a day.

586
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:30,070
I can give you a penny a day. Does
that sound good? That sounds good. Cut.

587
00:35:30,071 --> 00:35:33,400
Turned down and got left out. As a matter
of fact, just to digress for a moment,

588
00:35:33,401 --> 00:35:36,280
one of those people that I said, you
could make money doing this. I said,

589
00:35:36,281 --> 00:35:39,450
not only that,
we're to give you a local availabilities.

590
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,700
I got this funny look like what's
a local availability? Yeah,

591
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:47,200
I was going to ask you. Yeah, well, what
we're going to do is answer ESPN. Whoa.

592
00:35:47,201 --> 00:35:51,510
Pause, and you can put in a
local sponsored Joe's pizza,

593
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:56,400
somebody Sam's Toyota or whatever in
your market and your telecast. Nuke him.

594
00:35:56,401 --> 00:36:00,450
Advertise. Oh, you know what the answer
was? Why would I want to do that?

595
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:06,000
I kind of did just what you
said like this, what? He said,

596
00:36:06,001 --> 00:36:09,990
I'd have to hire somebody to go sell.
I said,

597
00:36:09,991 --> 00:36:12,390
here's how I did it.
Very this,

598
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:14,580
that was probably rude that
I shouldn't have done this,

599
00:36:14,581 --> 00:36:18,210
but I did it cause it's a knee jerk
reaction to me. So said, here's an idea.

600
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:20,370
He sells a hundred he keeps tending.
You get 90

601
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:25,380
oh well maybe we can talk again.

602
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:29,670
Well now today,
back then cable,

603
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:34,080
the cable systems didn't make much money
advertising today it's a multibillion

604
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,870
dollar business as you know,
they just make all kinds of money.

605
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,920
So let's,
let's bring in what I've mentioned before.

606
00:36:40,921 --> 00:36:43,530
So if we could bring in what we have here,

607
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:48,540
I'll do my best to hold this in pieces.
Let me fall apart.

608
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:52,800
Pieces may fall apart. He tell us
what this is please. This is a,

609
00:36:52,801 --> 00:36:57,120
this is the latest and
greatest love of at the time,

610
00:36:57,121 --> 00:37:01,500
a third baseman in 1947
this is my original baseball
glove in high school when I

611
00:37:01,501 --> 00:37:04,950
was at high school, Sophomore.
And if you can see it,

612
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:09,510
I don't try and put your hand in there,
Tim, as if you were playing third base.

613
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:14,100
I'll be the guy who destroys
it on national television.

614
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:18,600
Can you imagine catching balls with that?
And it was,

615
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:21,510
that was not the easiest thing in the
world. This looks like cookie monster.

616
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:28,740
Now you know,
here's another baseball fans of the day.

617
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:31,350
This was what you had to do
when the evening was over.

618
00:37:31,351 --> 00:37:35,160
You turned around and you through your
glove back onto the outfield grass.

619
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:38,370
Major Leagues did it. We
did it. Say that again.

620
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:43,400
I didn't know this all virtually all
through the first half century when the

621
00:37:43,711 --> 00:37:45,470
infielders came off the
field or the outfields,

622
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,390
they never brought their glove
in with them into the dugout.

623
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,800
They left him the third basement
drop as long the fall line,

624
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:53,070
shortstop and throw his in short leftfield
second baseman in short right field.

625
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:58,860
Why nobody?
I mean today there's so if there's a,

626
00:37:59,490 --> 00:37:59,881
I dunno,

627
00:37:59,881 --> 00:38:03,240
a clean expos across field time out and
you have to get out and clean in here.

628
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:07,260
They were just littering the field with
their own gloves. But what amazes me,

629
00:38:07,261 --> 00:38:09,060
I found this in some storage.

630
00:38:09,061 --> 00:38:14,061
Obviously this was absolutely the most
expensive thing I had ever had in my life

631
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:18,960
to do with baseball at that point in 19,

632
00:38:18,961 --> 00:38:23,280
it was to be the spring of 1947
and I look at the gloves today.

633
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:28,700
Softball gloves are so much
better than this. And uh, I don't,

634
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:33,060
I don't know how we ever, I don't know
how everybody didn't have about a 500, uh,

635
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:36,520
feeling average because how we
caught things. I don't know.

636
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,840
It's pretty amazing though,

637
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:41,830
and I'm really pleased with that because
it does bring back lots of memories.

638
00:38:41,831 --> 00:38:46,090
Did you collect anything as a kid? I
what? Did you collect anything as a kid?

639
00:38:46,091 --> 00:38:50,410
Did you clicked? No statistics.
Statistics. I was into,

640
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,160
we had a, we had a little board game
where you spun an Arrow and it wouldn't,

641
00:38:54,161 --> 00:38:55,450
you know,
they sent out,

642
00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:00,460
I think maybe it was one of the bubble
gum companies that pay this little game

643
00:39:00,461 --> 00:39:01,900
and whoever they had on their cards,

644
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:05,050
they'd make the all star team for the
National Union American Legion that you're

645
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:09,010
gonna need to spin any, make up games
and percentages and to do all that.

646
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:11,050
I was forever drawing little things.

647
00:39:11,051 --> 00:39:15,760
I remember my father worked at the Ford
aircraft engine division and during the

648
00:39:15,761 --> 00:39:18,440
war and he brought me home,
uh,

649
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:23,560
what did they call a
mimeographed scorecards and
I would use those scorecards

650
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:26,850
and play a game and eight or nine or
10 minutes and fill out a scorecard and

651
00:39:26,851 --> 00:39:29,470
it's still that one and start
all over again. And I was just,

652
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:34,660
I guess now that I think about it, I had
a pretty long obsession with statistics.

653
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:42,120
If you were to give advice to yourself
on a day before ESPN launched,

654
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:48,220
not necessarily about the next day, but
just any advice whatsoever, would you,

655
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:49,540
would you give yourself any advice?

656
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:54,040
I probably would have hoped that we were
a little farther along going on the air.

657
00:39:54,041 --> 00:39:59,040
I W I always want to be the next step.
Um,

658
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:02,890
and it didn't turn out that the next
step would have been a whole lot better

659
00:40:02,891 --> 00:40:04,630
because everything turned out pretty well.

660
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:09,700
Are there any pitches that come to
mind that were complete disasters,

661
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:14,260
complete failures in any,
I certainly can. I mean,

662
00:40:14,261 --> 00:40:18,940
I've had my fair share. I'm just wondering
with regard to ESPN or, or anything,

663
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:23,080
anything just oh yeah.
Entrepreneurs start,

664
00:40:23,081 --> 00:40:26,830
lots of businesses very convinced
that everything's going to work fine.

665
00:40:26,831 --> 00:40:27,780
I did the,
uh,

666
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:34,050
radio networks for Massachusetts
University of Massachusetts
and then expand it.

667
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:38,830
They're doing basketball networks
and hockey that works every time.

668
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:40,570
I thought they were really
good, somebody to say, well,

669
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:44,770
we're not going to do that anymore.
And I said, okay. And you know,

670
00:40:44,771 --> 00:40:48,010
that's the way it is. Obviously
you're disappointed. Yeah.

671
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:53,890
But you can't stop living. It's not the
end of the world. I mean, you keep eating,

672
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:59,410
that's all there is to it.
And uh, I don't know if it's,

673
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:03,760
if it's luck,
if it's coincidence,

674
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:05,920
if it's,
I dunno what,

675
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:10,320
whenever I've had a moment to
come, uh, we had, uh, we had a,

676
00:41:10,321 --> 00:41:15,321
a home automation company that we bought
into long before all of the technology

677
00:41:16,061 --> 00:41:19,450
could make it really happen.
Not a good idea.

678
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:24,340
Sounded like a great idea at the
time, but you know, what, we tried,

679
00:41:24,341 --> 00:41:27,850
it didn't work.
Push aside and keep on going.

680
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:32,110
So you, you've been thought
of as this, for instance,

681
00:41:32,111 --> 00:41:34,610
with the NCAA as sort of not Nostradamus

682
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:37,280
of college sports, right? Because you,

683
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:40,640
you got the programming
and then Lo and behold,

684
00:41:40,641 --> 00:41:45,480
we have Larry Bird Magic Johnson. All
of a sudden it's the rage, right? Yeah.

685
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,920
And it seems like, Eh, certainly I've,

686
00:41:47,921 --> 00:41:50,180
I've seen this a lot where
I live in Silicon Valley,

687
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:54,680
that you've had a lot of great bets,
but some of them,

688
00:41:54,681 --> 00:41:58,100
like the home automation had been early
and you've paddled for the long. Really?

689
00:41:58,370 --> 00:42:03,320
Yeah. How do you, how do you think about
evaluating opportunities like that?

690
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:05,660
I mean,
you've made plenty of investments as well.

691
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:10,940
Well, what I would, I think about is
obviously we all think about the success.

692
00:42:10,941 --> 00:42:14,100
I bet if I might think about success
a little bit differently, you know,

693
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:19,310
we put together a business
plan, right? What's your,
what's your mission statement?

694
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:23,390
Have you ever seen mission
statements? Sure. Page long three. Oh,

695
00:42:23,391 --> 00:42:25,680
I know what you have. But I mean,
some of them are page long summer,

696
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:29,870
three paragraphs.
They get beyond 10 or 12 words.

697
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:33,290
I think we've lost focus ESPN to this day.

698
00:42:33,291 --> 00:42:34,940
You know what their mission statement is?
Six words,

699
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:39,980
six words drive ESPN to serve
sports fans anytime, anywhere.

700
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,660
That's it. Does that say it
for ESPN or does it, yeah,

701
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:50,490
if I can't reduce it

702
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:53,530
to some simple that I can see it.

703
00:42:53,890 --> 00:42:57,400
Let's make it work this way. Um, we're,

704
00:42:57,401 --> 00:43:02,230
we're involved in a new
business. No, sounds funny.
At my age, right? I'm an old,

705
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:04,020
but I'm not that whole,
I'm not too old.

706
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:07,960
I want to do things like your brain
works 10 times faster than mine. So yeah,

707
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:09,040
I have no sympathy,

708
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:15,280
but this has to do with streaming.
What do I know about streaming?

709
00:43:15,281 --> 00:43:17,410
I didn't know anything about satellites,
but I'll find out.

710
00:43:17,411 --> 00:43:21,400
But I don't have to know about streaming.
You dream it. We streaming. How's that?

711
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:27,360
Six words. Six words.
Good statement. Good,

712
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:28,540
good mission statement.

713
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:33,730
But it really isn't everything
that we all undertake.

714
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,380
If you decide you're going
to go to the movie yet,

715
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:39,130
the second pick a good movie that you
want to go, say, pick the wrong one,

716
00:43:39,131 --> 00:43:43,030
what do you do? Well, we'll try it
again. Or do you go home and say,

717
00:43:43,031 --> 00:43:44,710
I'm never going to the movies
again because that didn't work.

718
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,250
When you make an investment,

719
00:43:46,251 --> 00:43:50,360
how do you decide how big it
is and do you cap the downside?

720
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:52,810
Is there a point where you say,
all right, you know what, this,

721
00:43:52,811 --> 00:43:55,700
this isn't where we want it to be.
I'm going to cut my losses.

722
00:43:55,701 --> 00:43:56,900
How do you think through that?

723
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:00,950
That I think that there, I think you
have to set a threshold, if you will,

724
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:04,260
that is both upper and lower.
[inaudible] uh,

725
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:08,330
I always think the sky's the limit
once you have to think at the bottom.

726
00:44:08,331 --> 00:44:13,160
And if it's not going to work,
take your medicine and,

727
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:16,100
and check out.
That's all I on theirs.

728
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:20,960
I can't tell you how many things and how
many times, how many cars do you buy.

729
00:44:20,961 --> 00:44:25,030
And then of course when you go into the
day, you buy the car. Oh, you're so,

730
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:29,640
oh this is perfect. And so what,
and what? Two years later, you know,

731
00:44:29,641 --> 00:44:31,140
maybe you're just slapping
things around the car,

732
00:44:31,141 --> 00:44:33,630
you throw things in the trunk
or something on the front seat,

733
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:35,190
you don't pay much attention to it.

734
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:37,560
And then pretty soon you
don't want that car anymore.

735
00:44:37,561 --> 00:44:39,630
You have to get another new car.
So that was gone.

736
00:44:39,630 --> 00:44:41,670
So you cut your losses and you get
rid of that. I want to get to know it.

737
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,600
And that would, life is all about
really what, what's your choice?

738
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:47,140
What are we going to do in the next hour?

739
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,770
What are we going to do the next day
or the week or the month that follows.

740
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:53,520
And then I've just been a,
I'm a positive.

741
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:55,320
I approached life from a positive side.

742
00:44:55,321 --> 00:44:59,040
And when you say it's a loss and how
do you cut your losses? Sure you,

743
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:02,250
you would rather not do that.
It's not the end of the world.

744
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:04,900
And part of the education
part of the education.

745
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:08,560
So when you look at, I mean you've,
you've used your time very well.

746
00:45:08,590 --> 00:45:13,590
I mean clearly putting together ESPN just
to make that series of miracles happen

747
00:45:15,490 --> 00:45:18,190
can't depend on a miracle.
I mean you had some good timing,

748
00:45:18,191 --> 00:45:21,100
but you made a lot of good decisions
when you were at your peak,

749
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:25,270
when you were just a machine,
what did your days or weeks look like?

750
00:45:25,271 --> 00:45:28,840
How did you manage your time and maybe
the better question is how you do things

751
00:45:28,841 --> 00:45:29,674
differently.

752
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:34,860
What I would do is every day,
if I had to meet you someplace,

753
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:37,850
you were on the schedule tomorrow,
you,

754
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:39,300
you were the next thing
that I was going to do,

755
00:45:39,301 --> 00:45:42,180
but seven other things might come up.
Vinny Twain and I'd have to figure it out,

756
00:45:42,181 --> 00:45:46,890
how to do them and some of my put back
to after you and I really, it sounds fun.

757
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:50,700
It's funny, it sounds like
maybe I'm at a pinball machine.

758
00:45:50,701 --> 00:45:51,780
I've gone from area to area,

759
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:57,410
but each one of those stops had
meaning in of some sort. Uh,

760
00:45:57,570 --> 00:46:01,640
back in the soliciting
cable operators time we,

761
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:05,870
there was a book back then called standard
rate and data service. There was no,

762
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:08,400
remember that you remember that big book.

763
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:14,000
We would look up sports directors or
radio or a presence of cable system.

764
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:19,140
We decided we were just going to
go pitch the top 20 cable systems.

765
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:23,010
Two of US split. I took the
top first. Then the next
guy, Eddie Egan was his name,

766
00:46:23,011 --> 00:46:28,011
took the next 10 and we had a young lady
sitting in our hallway in our office

767
00:46:28,411 --> 00:46:31,560
that was her office was in the hallway
outside two offices. We only had two

768
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:37,950
and we had her call each of those cable
operators and say here in Los Angeles

769
00:46:37,951 --> 00:46:38,910
for through was one.
We'd say,

770
00:46:38,911 --> 00:46:42,450
you know bill is going to be in Los
Angeles on Thursday and it would like to

771
00:46:42,451 --> 00:46:45,660
meet with Tim at two o'clock. I
don't know who Tim is, I don't,

772
00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:47,340
I don't even know where your officers,

773
00:46:47,341 --> 00:46:51,090
I'm going to have to get out there and
find a map and find you. We did that.

774
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:54,840
She called 10 cable system,
the 10 biggest cable session at the time,

775
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:58,260
all 10 of them for convening
all 10 of them,

776
00:46:58,261 --> 00:47:01,140
so five of them were in Denver and I
just went right down the street and met

777
00:47:01,141 --> 00:47:04,900
with them all and kept him. Those
kinds of things. Don't be a,

778
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,620
don't be afraid to try crazy things.
I mean,

779
00:47:07,621 --> 00:47:09,210
who would have thought
something like that would work?

780
00:47:09,430 --> 00:47:11,930
I'd probably be saying what?
What happens today?

781
00:47:11,931 --> 00:47:15,220
If your cell phone rings and a phone
number says unknown, I don't answer it.

782
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:19,830
Don't answer. Does anybody answer? Not
me. I had two of those today. Hang Up.

783
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:24,840
So now here we are calling. You have to
have to do with this way. Put the dial.

784
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:30,790
That's a long way back.
And, and I, I just think

785
00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:33,580
if you're,

786
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:38,580
if your intentions are not honorable
and you're not trying to do a good thing

787
00:47:39,161 --> 00:47:41,740
for yourself and the customer,
you shouldn't make the call.

788
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:47,540
But if you're trying to [inaudible]

789
00:47:49,270 --> 00:47:54,270
so two things I want to point out just
to underscore first is that you had two

790
00:47:54,671 --> 00:47:56,080
offices,
three people,

791
00:47:56,530 --> 00:48:01,530
but you very adeptly gave the
impression of having a larger company,

792
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:05,680
right? Oh yeah. We were big. We
had this big thing, huge hallway.

793
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:10,710
And then number two is this gambit of
So-and-so's is going to be in town for two

794
00:48:11,921 --> 00:48:14,050
days.
Can you take the meeting if you had said,

795
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:17,620
I'm based in La and I'd love to take
the meeting and the next two days never

796
00:48:17,621 --> 00:48:20,800
would have happened. Right. I
don't know why for whatever reason,

797
00:48:20,801 --> 00:48:24,040
this psychological judo
moves just works so well,

798
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:25,630
but it works for just about everything.
Yeah.

799
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:28,210
To this day I'm calling from Hartford,
Connecticut.

800
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:31,680
Good. Then I'm going to or
will Plainville, Connecticut
at the time. DENVER,

801
00:48:31,681 --> 00:48:34,740
Colorado as long way off
Houston, Texas, by the way,

802
00:48:34,741 --> 00:48:38,430
on that swing of 10 yeah.
You've got two customers

803
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:41,430
so I, okay, so I have a
question. So you're like,

804
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:44,430
just so happens that a bill
is going to be in Denver,

805
00:48:44,431 --> 00:48:47,070
Colorado next week for
two days when you show up.

806
00:48:47,071 --> 00:48:49,050
Did they ever ask you while
you're in Denver, Colorado?

807
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:50,503
No.

808
00:48:50,810 --> 00:48:54,740
They knew it because apparently at that
point they would have figured out by

809
00:48:54,741 --> 00:48:57,740
then, but who we were.
Yeah, I do remember though,

810
00:48:57,770 --> 00:49:02,160
visiting TCI and I'm not sure TCI is Iran.
I do remember them.

811
00:49:02,161 --> 00:49:03,800
I don't know if they're still don't.
I Dunno.

812
00:49:03,830 --> 00:49:06,440
I think maybe at and t bought
them at one point. But anyway,

813
00:49:06,650 --> 00:49:08,810
I went in to meet with this
fellow and I hit my 11 law.

814
00:49:08,930 --> 00:49:13,010
Literally when you asked earlier I at
one piece of paper type written 11 lines.

815
00:49:13,011 --> 00:49:14,600
That was my whole pitch.
That was it.

816
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:17,600
Verse any of these 11 lines.
This is like the holy grail.

817
00:49:18,010 --> 00:49:20,760
Not really, but I mean it was,
we're going to do 24 hour sports,

818
00:49:20,761 --> 00:49:23,070
we're going to do college and et Cetera,
et cetera.

819
00:49:23,071 --> 00:49:25,590
We're going to be financed by Getty.
We're going to be financed.

820
00:49:25,591 --> 00:49:26,670
We didn't say by getting it right,

821
00:49:26,910 --> 00:49:30,240
we expect to be the largest
cable provider to turn her.

822
00:49:30,241 --> 00:49:33,620
Only had 3 million subscribers at that
point. It took us a year to slow. Best.

823
00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:34,920
Damn. Yeah, that was fun.

824
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:39,150
But I went to an enemy to TCI and this
older gentleman that I was meeting with,

825
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:40,530
I mean he was my age,

826
00:49:40,531 --> 00:49:44,670
but he was not a rookie and vice
president of something and he had been a

827
00:49:44,671 --> 00:49:47,940
broadcaster in Minneapolis and
he looked across at me and he,

828
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:52,530
and he kind of smiled and he said, no,
this isn't gonna work. You said, you know,

829
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:55,440
we both been in as a tip broadcast.
I do know it's going to work.

830
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:58,800
Cable television. I said, you're working
for TCI. Well, yeah, he said that.

831
00:49:58,801 --> 00:50:01,830
He admitted that we went back and
forth a little bit and he said,

832
00:50:02,070 --> 00:50:04,170
I'm telling you any, he
did just this. He said,

833
00:50:04,171 --> 00:50:07,710
I'm telling you it's not going to work,
but if it does,

834
00:50:07,711 --> 00:50:10,800
I want to be your first customer.
I thought trip to Denver,

835
00:50:10,801 --> 00:50:14,160
it's been a success and he was in
fact the third customer, he didn't,

836
00:50:14,161 --> 00:50:16,290
he didn't make it fast.
Now it could be the first customer.

837
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:19,950
So a lot of those things
just happen on the spot.

838
00:50:21,210 --> 00:50:26,160
You have to kind of know all of the
general areas you want to go and stay with

839
00:50:26,161 --> 00:50:29,480
it and then at,
and it still works to this day.

840
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:33,990
This is the first is from Facebook,
from Sid Jacobson.

841
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:35,910
Why don't they show
Australian rules football,

842
00:50:35,911 --> 00:50:38,220
the world's strongest man and
sticker tournament's anymore.

843
00:50:38,790 --> 00:50:41,460
My favorite part is the
second part of this.

844
00:50:41,461 --> 00:50:44,460
And what happened to this cool jackets?
They're reporters had dual air.

845
00:50:45,090 --> 00:50:47,490
So now that the first part,
I don't know if it,

846
00:50:47,491 --> 00:50:51,210
if it applies perfectly because I have
seen if so many channels now world's

847
00:50:51,211 --> 00:50:52,350
strongest man for instance.

848
00:50:52,351 --> 00:50:57,150
But is there anything that has been that
you got rid of? So you didn't take the,

849
00:50:57,210 --> 00:50:58,780
the rooftop tennis?

850
00:50:58,890 --> 00:51:00,000
No, no. That would never happen.

851
00:51:00,030 --> 00:51:04,740
A Australian rules football is
actually on ESPN Australia. Got It.

852
00:51:04,741 --> 00:51:07,110
All right, so just found
its way home. Yeah.

853
00:51:07,111 --> 00:51:10,700
It's just found its way back there and
not an occasion that will will show there.

854
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:14,580
There are layers of ESPN, ESPN, the
mothership, that's what they call,

855
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:17,400
it's like star wars only. It's
ESPN sports, the mothership.

856
00:51:17,430 --> 00:51:21,870
But then it's to a news and you
and Xyz and around the world,

857
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:26,190
but then they have a Australia and so on.
And as a matter of fact,

858
00:51:26,191 --> 00:51:29,670
it's intriguing. The show
Australia, the national,

859
00:51:29,671 --> 00:51:33,680
the a cricket championship, right.
They sent a crew to Australia,

860
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:37,590
do a lot of uh,
preproduction a tape,

861
00:51:38,130 --> 00:51:41,370
brought it back and actually produce
the cricket championship from Bristol,

862
00:51:41,371 --> 00:51:44,370
Connecticut while they
were playing in Australia.

863
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:48,480
And you know how that works with
satellites? I don't have any idea,

864
00:51:48,930 --> 00:51:51,360
but they are an Australian rules.
Football is,

865
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:55,230
I'll never forget those guys in the
white hats and that was pretty cool.

866
00:51:55,470 --> 00:51:57,300
Never it never understood
it but it was pretty good.

867
00:51:57,510 --> 00:52:00,830
It's a cool sport to for those of you
haven't seen these, these athletes,

868
00:52:00,831 --> 00:52:05,140
a lot of them have accuracy with kicking
that quarterbacks in the u s have with

869
00:52:05,141 --> 00:52:05,770
their,
with their,

870
00:52:05,770 --> 00:52:09,220
no. So it was cool jackets that we used
to have one of the cool jackets you're

871
00:52:09,221 --> 00:52:10,630
talking about the Getty red,

872
00:52:10,631 --> 00:52:15,070
the orange and as soon as possible
and practicable we got it.

873
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:20,600
No there's shortly after the
check arrived, got rid of the,

874
00:52:21,230 --> 00:52:24,740
the right dead poet's society.
Slash [inaudible] we used to have to

875
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:28,100
pin little ESPN zone,

876
00:52:28,101 --> 00:52:31,010
those jackets that we didn't have them
embroidery cause we didn't have the

877
00:52:31,011 --> 00:52:32,600
budget. I guess. I don't know why but

878
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:37,650
wait. All right, well I may have to go
hunt down one of those jackets for myself.

879
00:52:37,651 --> 00:52:41,970
Next question is from Twitter at Neil.

880
00:52:41,971 --> 00:52:43,950
Oh Martin,
I may be saying that incorrectly.

881
00:52:43,951 --> 00:52:46,740
What sports do you wish
were more popular on ESPN?

882
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:48,801
There's so many.
I mean,

883
00:52:48,801 --> 00:52:52,820
I like college football and I like college
basketball and Major League Baseball,

884
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,780
uh, and I don't know how much
more they can put on. Yeah. Um,

885
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:01,760
they just put together a new,
190,000 square foot digital center,

886
00:53:01,761 --> 00:53:02,660
new digital center.

887
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:07,460
And in there they have one studio devoted
to the NFL only it's a half a football

888
00:53:07,461 --> 00:53:11,360
field.
They have rising whatever,

889
00:53:11,361 --> 00:53:15,110
and they have things that flow down and
balconies and stairsteps as you can walk

890
00:53:15,111 --> 00:53:19,250
up on all over. Uh, and that's,
that's pretty impressive.

891
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:22,430
And I don't know what else they could
do for the NFL besides that. I mean,

892
00:53:22,431 --> 00:53:25,620
they're, they're doing everything except
having Roger Goodell and for breakfast,

893
00:53:25,621 --> 00:53:26,454
I guess on

894
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:31,530
odd sport or Esoteric sport that
you guys had on in the early days,

895
00:53:31,531 --> 00:53:34,490
did you have a particular favorite?
You know,

896
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:37,920
we had an amateur boxing series
and I've forgotten what it was,

897
00:53:37,921 --> 00:53:38,850
what the name who was,

898
00:53:38,851 --> 00:53:43,851
but what I remember about it as I was
in the Dallas Airport when they had the

899
00:53:44,371 --> 00:53:47,370
trains underground,
not the way they are now elevated.

900
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,550
And I was getting on a
train and I heard somebody,

901
00:53:50,551 --> 00:53:52,770
I was just stepping through the door and
you know, you stepped through the door,

902
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:53,700
closes right behind it.

903
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:59,240
I heard somebody calling me and
we were Bob Arum and Don King,

904
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:00,481
I'm getting on.

905
00:54:00,481 --> 00:54:03,980
And then somebody said the calling my
name and I looked back and here it is and

906
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:06,450
he's pounding on the windows
and he wanted to talk to me.

907
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:11,520
But the train pulled out and before
he ever got back into the discussion,

908
00:54:11,521 --> 00:54:15,420
we signed an agreement with Bob Arum,
some of those crazy things.

909
00:54:15,421 --> 00:54:18,590
And that happened on a train and the
randomness of walking down a tree,

910
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:22,050
a stairs to get on a tram
to go to another flight.

911
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:27,060
The guy comes down the door closes,
he lost his program chance. Wow.

912
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:30,960
Crazy stuff. I mean that's just the
way it was. It's like terrifying.

913
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:33,090
Slash meets like when Harry met Sally,

914
00:54:33,091 --> 00:54:35,560
it's kind of like a
misconnection don king.

915
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:38,880
But that boxing series to answer
the question and that was,

916
00:54:38,881 --> 00:54:41,130
that was a really interesting,
a lot of boxers,

917
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:45,540
no name boxers at that time when a couple
of them I guess did rise through the

918
00:54:45,541 --> 00:54:49,160
ranks. That was kind of fun. I'm
so glad I'm not a boxing fan. Oh,

919
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:54,180
I am a, I am a huge boxing fan,
but uh, also a huge hurling fan.

920
00:54:54,570 --> 00:54:55,980
So for those of you who haven't seen it,

921
00:54:55,981 --> 00:54:59,760
I definitely recommend checking out
the senior nationals of Irish hurling.

922
00:54:59,790 --> 00:55:03,120
It will blow your mind. It's
like football, meats, Lacrosse,

923
00:55:03,121 --> 00:55:06,300
but they're playing with ax handles and
can hit each other and hit it like a

924
00:55:06,301 --> 00:55:10,800
baseball. It's terrifying. I la,
I had, I was invited to do an,

925
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:12,660
uh,
an interview in Dublin.

926
00:55:12,690 --> 00:55:16,800
We did via Skype and I agreed to do it
only if the host would explain to me

927
00:55:16,950 --> 00:55:17,820
Irish early,

928
00:55:17,910 --> 00:55:22,320
which he did and I used to describe it
as two guys with baseball bats and the

929
00:55:22,321 --> 00:55:24,150
right hand and left hand betters boxes,

930
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:27,880
the ball on a tee in the middle
and the somebody reached in,

931
00:55:27,910 --> 00:55:28,490
throws it in the air.

932
00:55:28,490 --> 00:55:31,440
They both take mighty swipes at
it and hope they miss each other.

933
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:33,710
I'm not so sure.
Sometimes they hope they miss each other,

934
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:38,490
then they go right after each other.
If you want to see, uh, yeah. What,

935
00:55:38,491 --> 00:55:41,190
what the, uh, the Irish do when they're
not drinking Guinness. And by the way,

936
00:55:41,191 --> 00:55:43,770
the senior nationals are
sponsored by Guinness generally.

937
00:55:43,771 --> 00:55:48,030
So Internet don't go crazy. Uh,
then you should check it out.

938
00:55:48,070 --> 00:55:52,620
It is fantastic. We did have
those, by the way, at one time.

939
00:55:52,621 --> 00:55:56,250
Did you ever see that those early red
jackets that had ESPN and the circle

940
00:55:56,251 --> 00:55:59,100
around it? The original, I
can imagine though. I mean,

941
00:55:59,101 --> 00:56:02,100
knowing what the logo looks like.
Well, it happens in the jacket.

942
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:05,280
It's one of the greatest
marketing stories.

943
00:56:05,850 --> 00:56:09,270
Espn ahead in the early days. Let's
get into it. We had these red jackets,

944
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:12,300
little logo on the front,
the, it wasn't ESB network,

945
00:56:12,301 --> 00:56:14,700
it was the ESPN with the lips around it.

946
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:20,660
And we had the bright red jackets and
in white on the back it had ESPN and the

947
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:25,600
logo and Scotty Connell said,
we, we were credentialed.

948
00:56:25,601 --> 00:56:27,190
We could go to college football games.

949
00:56:27,850 --> 00:56:30,430
He hired kids and gave him
a notebook and a red jacket,

950
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,060
send them to any game
CBS was doing and said,

951
00:56:34,061 --> 00:56:35,940
I want one of you on the 25 yard line,

952
00:56:35,950 --> 00:56:39,880
one of you on the 50 yard line and one
of you on the other 25 yard line and two

953
00:56:39,881 --> 00:56:42,850
more stay with the line of
scrimmage backfield and offense.

954
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:47,650
Now if you're familiar with the way of
football game was covered cameras around

955
00:56:47,651 --> 00:56:49,120
the 25 or 30 yard line.

956
00:56:49,121 --> 00:56:53,170
They shoot down field and there's one
high in the middle and then there's

957
00:56:53,171 --> 00:56:56,140
usually some down in the field near the
backfield or the line of scrimmage and

958
00:56:56,141 --> 00:56:56,974
so on.

959
00:56:57,220 --> 00:57:01,900
So every shot that CBS did that first
week had an ESPN logo or product placement

960
00:57:02,290 --> 00:57:04,840
right in, right in the middle of
Monday morning. The phone rang,

961
00:57:04,841 --> 00:57:09,730
we're going to suit you guys, you can't
do that. CanNot do that. Scotty said,

962
00:57:09,731 --> 00:57:13,000
okay, fine. We're CBS planning. Next week.

963
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:18,200
I did the same thing and after the second
week they called and said, alright,

964
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:21,520
we surrender.
And so he didn't change very much,

965
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:24,260
but he cut it down I guess
from five to three either side.

966
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:25,113
That's about all he did.

967
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:31,150
Mother advertising that case was the
necessity was the mother of invention and

968
00:57:31,151 --> 00:57:34,540
that one, oh, that's genius. But
those red jackets counted a lot.

969
00:57:36,430 --> 00:57:40,000
I was in the fourth grade that
morning that we had Pearl Harbor,

970
00:57:40,001 --> 00:57:43,150
the day of infamy and I've read the,
uh,

971
00:57:43,690 --> 00:57:46,720
midway and Pearl Harbor and
all of the books around that.

972
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:49,090
And I have a library of about,

973
00:57:51,370 --> 00:57:53,920
it's probably a hundred to 150 books of,

974
00:57:54,010 --> 00:57:58,540
from the early thirties all the
way through up to the Vietnam War,

975
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:00,310
Korean War.

976
00:58:01,130 --> 00:58:06,130
Coldest winter is one that
I would recommend a David
Halberstam wrote that one.

977
00:58:06,521 --> 00:58:09,940
Coldest butter. Yeah. And there are just,

978
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:14,260
I don't know what it is. I really just
enjoy reading it. It's not that I'm,

979
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:19,900
I'm lucky, obviously I'm lucky that
I'm here and able to do this, but,

980
00:58:19,901 --> 00:58:20,734
uh,

981
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:25,480
the things that people have done
for us in this country are amazing.

982
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:29,590
This, this point I think is really
important. So only in the last,

983
00:58:29,591 --> 00:58:34,300
I would say six months have I started
reading more books related to war

984
00:58:34,390 --> 00:58:36,370
specifically in this country.

985
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:40,440
And one of the main reasons is that,
uh,

986
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:41,770
spoken with a number of folks,

987
00:58:41,771 --> 00:58:45,460
including former navy seal
commander named Jocko Willink,

988
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:46,960
is very well known.

989
00:58:47,950 --> 00:58:50,980
And the point that he makes is that
if you want to study human nature,

990
00:58:51,850 --> 00:58:53,890
you can learn,
and I'm paraphrasing of course,

991
00:58:53,891 --> 00:58:58,810
but you can learn so much by looking
at it when it's forced to the extremes,

992
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:03,250
when you see the most
unbelievable levels of kindness,

993
00:59:03,251 --> 00:59:08,251
the most unbelievable levels of brutality
and everything in stark relief when

994
00:59:08,651 --> 00:59:10,750
you study Warren Warfare.

995
00:59:11,050 --> 00:59:13,900
So if you are a student of human nature,

996
00:59:13,930 --> 00:59:17,560
which of course transcends
this conversation and applies
to just about anything,

997
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:20,950
that was one of the points that he made.
And just to,

998
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:23,390
to pull it into say
new media for a second,

999
00:59:23,391 --> 00:59:26,840
if people are wondering if anybody
here knows who Casey Neistat is,

1000
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:30,770
might have a few hands.
He is an extremely well known utuber.

1001
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:34,160
He has hundreds and hundreds and
hundreds of millions of views, very,

1002
00:59:34,161 --> 00:59:36,140
very well known a filmmaker.

1003
00:59:36,290 --> 00:59:40,670
And he says that everything he
learned about business and life,

1004
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:45,480
he learned from studying World War II.
Effectively. It's that powerful. Uh,

1005
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:52,180
when you say that, just people
don't, they think of America.

1006
00:59:52,230 --> 00:59:53,700
We're just here.
We won the war.

1007
00:59:55,290 --> 00:59:58,800
All our planes were built in the
interior of the country because they were

1008
00:59:58,950 --> 01:00:02,400
worried about Japan coming to
the Pacific and in Germany,

1009
01:00:02,401 --> 01:00:06,630
the submarines were made in Manitowoc,
Wisconsin.

1010
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:08,100
You think of a submarine,

1011
01:00:08,101 --> 01:00:11,580
why would you do a submarine
and that walkway for safety?

1012
01:00:11,610 --> 01:00:15,990
Because they had German u boats on
the East Coast and Japanese may be,

1013
01:00:15,991 --> 01:00:18,660
they don't know. On the
west coast, like Michigan,

1014
01:00:18,661 --> 01:00:22,380
the Naval Air Station in plain view had
an aircraft carrier in Lake Michigan,

1015
01:00:22,381 --> 01:00:25,100
and that was where they learned to fly.
That's where they got their wings.

1016
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:30,690
Who knows? It's gotta be
hard to transport. Yeah,
but just think about that.

1017
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:33,840
Lake Michigan is right outside Chicago,

1018
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:36,900
pled will enable it and cleanse your
naval air stations right outside Chicago.

1019
01:00:37,530 --> 01:00:40,770
The navy is training in the middle
of the country for two oceans.

1020
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:46,380
Why aren't they in the San Diego area
or Los Angeles or Philadelphia enabled

1021
01:00:46,381 --> 01:00:51,120
yards. But you learn, you can
really learn a lot about the,

1022
01:00:52,110 --> 01:00:56,870
the, the operation of
life. One thing that I,

1023
01:00:57,290 --> 01:01:00,030
and I, every time I've mentioned
this, somebody is surprised.

1024
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:06,680
We always hear about women at work
during World War II and especially in the

1025
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:10,950
aircraft industry and making those
submarines and Manitowoc, Wisconsin,

1026
01:01:11,430 --> 01:01:15,900
the majority of the labor force were women
because they were more able to do the

1027
01:01:15,901 --> 01:01:20,520
delicate detailed work detail work
and the wiring for the wiring.

1028
01:01:20,521 --> 01:01:24,000
Then for radio and for all of those
things with a lot different than right to

1029
01:01:24,001 --> 01:01:25,980
today. Well today they wouldn't
wire that would all be,

1030
01:01:26,410 --> 01:01:31,210
I'll be at a chip someplace but we
never hear about that. Yup. And uh,

1031
01:01:31,370 --> 01:01:32,970
it was an all out effort,
believe me.

1032
01:01:35,270 --> 01:01:39,530
So this, this is going to be a bit of a
left turn, but I want to ask you about it.

1033
01:01:39,531 --> 01:01:43,630
Your signal, you're signaling
at least left turn strike.
Oh wait, no, I forgot to,

1034
01:01:44,020 --> 01:01:46,850
I would be terrible. Empire. I tell
you, even worst baseball player,

1035
01:01:46,851 --> 01:01:47,780
but that's a different story.

1036
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:53,540
Your best or one of your best or most
worthwhile investments you've ever made.

1037
01:01:53,690 --> 01:01:57,350
And I want to explain what I mean by
that. It could be money, it could be time,

1038
01:01:57,380 --> 01:02:02,360
it could be energy, could be anything.
And an example that comes from, uh,

1039
01:02:02,361 --> 01:02:05,150
someone I've chatted with
separately is Amelia Boone.

1040
01:02:05,290 --> 01:02:08,450
Amelia Boone's a three time a
world's toughest mudder champion.

1041
01:02:08,451 --> 01:02:10,850
She's the most decorated obstacle
course racer in the world.

1042
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:13,100
Also a full time attorney at Apple.

1043
01:02:13,101 --> 01:02:15,740
She's one of the most
impressive humans I've ever met.

1044
01:02:16,430 --> 01:02:21,150
In her answer to that was the entrance
fee for her first major competition,

1045
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:24,480
which was I think about $450.
A huge stretch at the time for her.

1046
01:02:24,481 --> 01:02:29,310
But she did it and it produced this
incredible open door and trajectory to

1047
01:02:29,311 --> 01:02:33,660
something she never would
have anticipated. What are
one of your best investment?

1048
01:02:33,890 --> 01:02:36,050
That $9,000 credit card cash advance?

1049
01:02:36,530 --> 01:02:37,363
Yeah.

1050
01:02:42,210 --> 01:02:43,990
I have to tell you,
I have to tell you that

1051
01:02:44,070 --> 01:02:47,340
brief story about that.
I spoke to a group of um,

1052
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:52,140
Merrill Lynch and I think
it was bank of America,

1053
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:56,640
all senior executives in Greenwich,
Connecticut, some a couple of years ago.

1054
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:02,790
And one of the topics that came up in the
discussion because these banks like to

1055
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:07,200
lend money and you should have bank
loans and start your business and we will

1056
01:03:07,201 --> 01:03:11,190
work with you and we'll do you know,
I'm not, I'm not 100% subscriber that.

1057
01:03:11,550 --> 01:03:14,610
So when it was my turn to speak, I
get up and I said, well first of all,

1058
01:03:14,611 --> 01:03:19,611
you'll all be happy to know that I
started ESPN with bank financing and they

1059
01:03:21,181 --> 01:03:24,510
were all sitting, every single one of
them, a tie in pinstripe suits and so on.

1060
01:03:25,350 --> 01:03:29,100
I said, well, it depends on how you define
financing. It was a $9,000 credit card,

1061
01:03:29,101 --> 01:03:32,970
cash advance. Well, I was talking about
an icebreaker that got me through to them,

1062
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:36,570
but the real thing that got me through
that group was there were a couple of

1063
01:03:36,571 --> 01:03:40,100
Hartford whaler from New England whalers
fans in the audience that salvage that

1064
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:43,470
sealed the deal. But to me, he's
a speak to a group like that.

1065
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:45,840
They all,

1066
01:03:46,350 --> 01:03:50,010
and I hope I'm not insulting anyone in
the audience watching or sitting here

1067
01:03:50,011 --> 01:03:50,844
today.

1068
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:55,200
There is a certain confidence,

1069
01:03:55,890 --> 01:04:00,890
a certain bearing and feeling that
people have because they help others down

1070
01:04:02,371 --> 01:04:06,330
below them. And as I walked into the
room, I was the oldest guy in the room.

1071
01:04:06,331 --> 01:04:08,310
They were all like some of my kids' age.

1072
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:10,570
So they weren't intimidating to me at all.
I just,

1073
01:04:10,770 --> 01:04:13,800
we started talking before the meeting was
over there at loosening their ties and

1074
01:04:13,801 --> 01:04:17,450
we had just a great, great
session with them. And, uh,

1075
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:22,980
which I think reaching people is part
of what you have to do to win here.

1076
01:04:29,150 --> 01:04:29,983
I want to talk,

1077
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:33,640
talk about reaching people in a,
in a very particular instance.

1078
01:04:33,641 --> 01:04:36,560
So when you got that cash advance,

1079
01:04:36,590 --> 01:04:40,120
$9,000 cash advance on a credit card
where you married or are you saying,

1080
01:04:40,150 --> 01:04:44,620
oh yeah. Okay. So now three kids, couple
of them in college doesn't matter.

1081
01:04:44,621 --> 01:04:48,400
So in today's dollars, I don't know
what that would be. It's maybe 40 grand.

1082
01:04:48,401 --> 01:04:51,400
I'm just pulling a number out.
Yeah, I have no idea. It was that,

1083
01:04:52,390 --> 01:04:54,250
was that a lot of money
for you guys at the time?

1084
01:04:54,251 --> 01:04:55,810
And was that a conversation
that you've had that,

1085
01:04:56,330 --> 01:05:01,090
let me put it in context.
We had a drawer in the kitchen,

1086
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:03,980
a little counter and so on. And the
checkbook was it there? You know,

1087
01:05:04,060 --> 01:05:06,620
cause then we wrote, wrote, check, we
didn't have all this internet stuff.

1088
01:05:06,750 --> 01:05:11,560
I couldn't pay no bill payer.
Right. And I was writing a check in,

1089
01:05:11,561 --> 01:05:14,600
my youngest son walked by me and he said,

1090
01:05:16,450 --> 01:05:18,940
is everything all and all,
he was kind of concerned and I was,

1091
01:05:18,941 --> 01:05:22,390
cause I hit the checkbook laying
there and we open the checkbook is,

1092
01:05:22,391 --> 01:05:25,660
it was just before pay day and
he said that can't be right.

1093
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:27,820
And there were 17 cents
in the bank account,

1094
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:31,960
not in the bank but in the
checkbook. Right. 17 cents.

1095
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:36,660
And he said, are you worried? And I said,
why? He said, well that's not gonna.

1096
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:38,390
You know,
we're not going far.

1097
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:43,780
He was a maybe a junior in college
at that point. But I never,

1098
01:05:43,781 --> 01:05:46,450
I never had any doubt because pay day
came and I know something else would

1099
01:05:46,451 --> 01:05:51,220
happen. And obviously did what's
your wife were at all? No. Nope.

1100
01:05:51,430 --> 01:05:55,330
Nope. Nope. She was, she
was nearly 11 bullet points.

1101
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:59,770
She knew all of it right down the
line yet. She was there for 56 years.

1102
01:05:59,771 --> 01:06:02,590
She was there. So it was
okay. That's incredible.

1103
01:06:02,940 --> 01:06:07,940
[inaudible]

1104
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:12,440
if we had a golf ball,

1105
01:06:13,550 --> 01:06:18,550
how would ask you about golf with
one of this country's presidents?

1106
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:21,650
I was hoping you could maybe
tell us a little bit about golf.

1107
01:06:21,651 --> 01:06:24,380
I think it was with George.
Yeah,

1108
01:06:24,410 --> 01:06:29,330
George 41 so tell us about,
I think there's one part in particular.

1109
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:34,130
Oh, well yeah, I would, maybe I was
a little irreverent, but, well, yeah,

1110
01:06:35,150 --> 01:06:38,720
I was invited to play with President
Bush and a Naples, Florida,

1111
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:42,590
and a, and just a great
guy. We went out and

1112
01:06:44,510 --> 01:06:47,330
met the only appropriate people, went
to the driving range, did all that,

1113
01:06:47,350 --> 01:06:49,760
had pictures, you know, thousand
pictures taken and so on.

1114
01:06:49,761 --> 01:06:53,360
And then we started playing and we
all hit on the green first green and,

1115
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:58,800
and he was maybe, I dunno, three or
four feet from the, from the, uh,

1116
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:02,750
the hole. And he was a
golfer. He used as longs,

1117
01:07:02,810 --> 01:07:05,840
the long putter where he put it up
under his Chin and gave the, you know,

1118
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:10,060
putting like this and he kept
swinging back and forth and,

1119
01:07:10,910 --> 01:07:13,640
and like, okay, who's going
to give me the Putt? You know,

1120
01:07:13,641 --> 01:07:15,500
because I guess you're supposed to.
But,

1121
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:18,070
so after about the fourth
time he stepped back again,

1122
01:07:18,071 --> 01:07:21,710
they looked over at us and I,
I don't know why I said,

1123
01:07:22,570 --> 01:07:26,630
it's just one of those things I said,
presidential privilege only goes so far.

1124
01:07:26,631 --> 01:07:27,464
Putt.

1125
01:07:29,850 --> 01:07:34,850
[inaudible] he looked up and he

1126
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:40,380
smiled and he said,
game on.

1127
01:07:40,620 --> 01:07:44,820
And so we had a $2 bet for the game
and I had to put this long at the,

1128
01:07:44,821 --> 01:07:45,631
on the 18th.

1129
01:07:45,631 --> 01:07:48,630
And obviously since he didn't get the
first one you with a bucket and I missed

1130
01:07:48,631 --> 01:07:53,100
it and he made his butt and one the
whole and one of the $2 and took the ball

1131
01:07:53,101 --> 01:07:57,390
out and said, I want you to have
this in honor of losing $2 to me.

1132
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:02,550
But I don't know why I said that to him.
It was probably inappropriate,

1133
01:08:02,551 --> 01:08:06,390
but he cracked up. Seems to have
turned out pretty well when you fly.

1134
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:07,950
Fly by the cuff.
Yeah.

1135
01:08:10,330 --> 01:08:14,510
[inaudible]

1136
01:08:23,510 --> 01:08:26,930
hey guys, this is Tim again. Just a
few more things before you take off.

1137
01:08:27,230 --> 01:08:29,900
Number one,
this is five bullet Friday.

1138
01:08:30,140 --> 01:08:33,160
Do you want to get a short email from me?

1139
01:08:33,170 --> 01:08:37,310
Would you enjoy getting a short email
from me every Friday that provides a

1140
01:08:37,311 --> 01:08:41,300
little morsel of fun before the weekend
and five bullet Friday is a very short

1141
01:08:41,301 --> 01:08:45,800
email where I share the coolest things
I've found or that I've been pondering

1142
01:08:45,801 --> 01:08:49,520
over the week. That could include
favorite new albums that I've discovered.

1143
01:08:49,521 --> 01:08:52,940
It could include Gizmos and gadgets
and all sorts of weird shit that I've

1144
01:08:52,941 --> 01:08:57,260
somehow dug up in the uh,
the world of the esoteric as I do.

1145
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:02,560
It could include favorite articles that
I've read and that I've shared with my

1146
01:09:03,231 --> 01:09:05,930
close friends for instance.
And it's very short.

1147
01:09:06,020 --> 01:09:11,000
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness
before you head off for the weekend.

1148
01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:13,220
So if you want to receive that,
check it out.

1149
01:09:13,490 --> 01:09:18,170
Just go to a four hour work week.com
that's four hour work week.com all spelled

1150
01:09:18,171 --> 01:09:21,350
out and just drop in your email
and you'll get the very next one.

1151
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:23,420
And if you sign up,
I hope you enjoy it.

1152
01:09:24,620 --> 01:09:27,380
This episode is brought
to you by four sigmatic,

1153
01:09:27,470 --> 01:09:32,470
founded by the genius Fin's who
that the Internet on fire and the,

1154
01:09:32,580 --> 01:09:34,370
you may have heard of
their mushroom coffee,

1155
01:09:34,371 --> 01:09:38,930
which features Chaga and lion's mane,
which has taken Silicon Valley by storm.

1156
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:41,900
I use it pretty much every day,

1157
01:09:41,901 --> 01:09:46,850
either that or the Chaga,
which is decaf and a separate version.

1158
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:50,390
And I use both of these primarily
for focus and productivity.

1159
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:54,710
They just get you going let
you up like a Christmas street,

1160
01:09:54,770 --> 01:09:56,480
so he's definitely check it out.

1161
01:09:56,870 --> 01:10:01,160
People are always asking me what I use
for cognitive enhancement and for right

1162
01:10:01,161 --> 01:10:05,870
now this is the answer. I try to
force this on all of my house guests.

1163
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:10,190
It is a hell of a thing if
I have employees or people
come over who are working

1164
01:10:10,191 --> 01:10:10,941
on projects with me,

1165
01:10:10,941 --> 01:10:14,810
I always try to feed it to them because
I'm going to get the limitless effect

1166
01:10:15,450 --> 01:10:16,460
and get a lot more out of them.

1167
01:10:16,910 --> 01:10:21,500
The first time I mentioned this product
and four sigmatic on the podcast,

1168
01:10:21,770 --> 01:10:23,720
their products sold out
in less than a week,

1169
01:10:23,750 --> 01:10:25,910
so you may want to check them out soon.

1170
01:10:25,911 --> 01:10:29,240
If you're listening to this and
the coffee tastes like coffee,

1171
01:10:29,390 --> 01:10:34,390
it takes just seconds to prepare with
hot water and oddly enough only includes

1172
01:10:35,661 --> 01:10:37,100
40 milligrams of caffeine,

1173
01:10:37,101 --> 01:10:39,950
so it has less than half of what you
would get in a regular cup of coffee.

1174
01:10:40,550 --> 01:10:44,360
I don't get any jitters, acid reflux
or any stomach burn, any of that.

1175
01:10:44,390 --> 01:10:46,700
It's very unusual and very,
very cool.

1176
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:51,440
So if you don't like caffeine,
they also offer very strong,

1177
01:10:51,441 --> 01:10:55,100
but caffeine free mushroom elixirs, which
I will sometimes have in the evening.

1178
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:58,490
I find Chaga specifically to be very,
very grounding and earthy.

1179
01:10:58,790 --> 01:11:02,870
So that is another option. And I have
a cupboard full of their products, uh,

1180
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:04,850
at the moment, which is right
around the corner of my kitchen.

1181
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:07,760
You can try something,
you can try a sample pack,

1182
01:11:07,761 --> 01:11:12,761
which is great also right now by
going to foursigmatic.com/tim that's

1183
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:17,970
foursigmatic, f, O, u,
R s, I g, m a t I c.com,

1184
01:11:17,971 --> 01:11:22,971
forward slash Tim and use the Code Tim
Tim to get 20% off your first order and

1185
01:11:23,101 --> 01:11:26,340
they're not that expensive. Anyway, if
you are in the experimental mindset,

1186
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:29,130
I do not think you'll be
disappointed to trim up.

1187
01:11:29,370 --> 01:11:32,220
This episode is brought
to you by a sense protein.

1188
01:11:32,430 --> 01:11:34,410
I am really excited about this discovery.

1189
01:11:34,860 --> 01:11:39,120
I became aware of these guys when I
found out that they'd spent five years

1190
01:11:39,121 --> 01:11:42,240
trying to manufacture a better
version of weight protein.

1191
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:46,330
And the result is something called native
proteins, which represents cleaner,

1192
01:11:46,340 --> 01:11:50,100
purer, less processed protein.
So here's a mini tutorial.

1193
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:54,960
There are only a handful of companies
worldwide that can extract native proteins

1194
01:11:54,961 --> 01:11:57,840
directly from mill
traditional whey protein.

1195
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:01,980
What you've probably bought before
is a byproduct of making cheese.

1196
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:04,320
So a company must have the resources,

1197
01:12:04,321 --> 01:12:08,850
no hell and a large customer
base to invest in extracting
proteins directly from

1198
01:12:08,851 --> 01:12:12,690
the milk without the ability to also
profit from the associated cheese.

1199
01:12:13,230 --> 01:12:17,010
That means the net net is native
proteins are super rare. So a sentence,

1200
01:12:17,011 --> 01:12:22,011
the only us based company that offers
native proteins both way and my seller

1201
01:12:22,081 --> 01:12:23,640
casing directly to a consumer,

1202
01:12:23,641 --> 01:12:28,641
they're able to do that because the
parent company Laprino is a huge cheese

1203
01:12:28,891 --> 01:12:29,550
manufacturer.

1204
01:12:29,550 --> 01:12:33,870
They've been filtering proteins for
more than 30 years and there are a few

1205
01:12:33,871 --> 01:12:35,670
important things to take away from this.
Number one,

1206
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:40,110
zero artificial ingredients that is a
solid claim is much stricter than all

1207
01:12:40,111 --> 01:12:43,800
natural. Number two, they've
done extensive testing.

1208
01:12:43,801 --> 01:12:46,860
So the chocolate which I've been using
after every workout and also in the

1209
01:12:46,861 --> 01:12:48,920
mornings because uh,

1210
01:12:49,050 --> 01:12:54,050
finalized after 282 recipes were
vetted and perhaps most important,

1211
01:12:56,670 --> 01:12:57,930
I talked about less processed.

1212
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:03,680
They avoid steps like leaching and this
is important to understand so it's,

1213
01:13:04,860 --> 01:13:08,580
it's a very big deal but hasn't
yet caught on for sports nutrition.

1214
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:12,540
Traditional whey proteins are a byproduct
of cheese making. Like I mentioned,

1215
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:16,050
many of the proteins are therefore
orange in color because they were sourced

1216
01:13:16,051 --> 01:13:19,970
from say cheddar cheese production because
companies can't sell orange powders

1217
01:13:19,990 --> 01:13:22,620
of Noah or strawberry.
They have to bleach the proteins white.

1218
01:13:23,070 --> 01:13:26,700
This harms the proteins and leaves
trace amounts of bleach in the product.

1219
01:13:26,701 --> 01:13:30,660
That is no Winham, no good infant
formula companies, for instance,

1220
01:13:30,661 --> 01:13:34,230
abandon banned the use of bleach proteins
already in in their products and that

1221
01:13:34,231 --> 01:13:36,390
is why a sense parent company,

1222
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:40,650
Leprino foods is the number one supplier
of protein, infinite formula companies.

1223
01:13:40,890 --> 01:13:44,250
So all that said, if you want
cleaner, pure, less process protein,

1224
01:13:44,430 --> 01:13:49,430
I certainly do and I'm really excited
to be using this protein and I just ran

1225
01:13:50,521 --> 01:13:54,070
out of chocolate so I need another
bag. Check it out. Go to a center,

1226
01:13:54,130 --> 01:13:57,240
protein.com forward slash Tim,
that's a s,

1227
01:13:57,300 --> 01:14:02,300
c e n t protein.com sent protein.com
forward slash Tim and you can receive 20%

1228
01:14:03,721 --> 01:14:08,370
off of your entire order and want a
quick 25 gram dose to start your day.

1229
01:14:08,371 --> 01:14:10,830
For instance, you're falling
slow carb diet or after workout.

1230
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:14,770
This is a great option. They also have my
cell key scene, which is slower release,

1231
01:14:14,771 --> 01:14:18,040
and you can check that out.
So take a look, go to a sense,

1232
01:14:18,050 --> 01:14:20,260
protein.com forward slash Kim.
