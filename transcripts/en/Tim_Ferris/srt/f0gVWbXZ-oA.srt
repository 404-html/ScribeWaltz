Good day.

23
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:40,600
This is Tim Ferriss.
I'm sitting in a park.

24
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:44,110
It's a beautiful park in San Francisco.
In the fall, weather is upon us.

25
00:01:44,111 --> 00:01:49,111
The leaves are turning color and the
eucalyptus are still standing tall.

26
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:52,270
The foliage has not yet fallen.
It's a beautiful day.

27
00:01:52,271 --> 00:01:55,750
For those of you who have not listened
to the Tim Ferriss show before.

28
00:01:56,050 --> 00:02:00,340
This is where I tried to use all of
my contacts and research to dissect

29
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,640
excellence, to figure out whether
it's a billionaire investor,

30
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:08,770
a chess prodigy and actor, or in this
episode's case and actor and a comedian.

31
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,540
How do they do what they do?

32
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:14,500
What are the tools and tactics and
tricks that you can use? So we dig very,

33
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:15,334
very deep,

34
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:20,730
but I'll start off with a
bit of linguistic trivia
and I will ask apologies,

35
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:25,180
or rather not apologies,
that'd be a weird way to phrase it.

36
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:29,860
Forgiveness from the Turkish speakers.
I love the Turkish language.

37
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:32,260
It's a fascinating language,
fascinating culture,

38
00:02:32,261 --> 00:02:36,730
a real collision of European
and Middle Eastern cultures.

39
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:42,400
And I also have found the similarity
between Turkish and Japanese.

40
00:02:42,401 --> 00:02:44,500
Very,
very interesting.

41
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:49,540
But I'll give you an idea of how I
deconstruct languages just by memorizing

42
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:53,620
phrases. You can pick out patterns.
So for instance, if you say,

43
00:02:53,621 --> 00:02:58,450
good day as translated into English
and Turkish. And I guess again,

44
00:02:58,451 --> 00:03:03,350
I've read, not, not set it a
lot, but it's Egan, Eagan large.

45
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:04,810
Okay,
good evening is

46
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:11,110
[inaudible] [inaudible] and then the,
the way you would say child,

47
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:16,170
I believe it's choke Cho Cho took or choke
hook and then you have a choco color.

48
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:20,890
Okay. So you noticed the lot at the
end. So to churn child into children,

49
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:26,100
you have the Lord at the end and it
turns out that literally good day is good

50
00:03:26,561 --> 00:03:29,110
days or good evenings in Turkish.

51
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:32,020
And so you can start to piece it
together without a dictionary,

52
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,310
without a gram reference
just by memorizing a handful,

53
00:03:36,311 --> 00:03:40,630
even like a hundred words or
phrases. Anyway, I'm a nerd.

54
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,913
There you have it.

55
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,100
But we're gonna move on to Brian Kellen
who's the guest for this episode.

56
00:03:45,101 --> 00:03:50,101
He is a prolific actor who has acted
in more shows than I can count,

57
00:03:50,411 --> 00:03:53,680
certainly, but includes pretty
much all the shows at the,

58
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,320
at the top of the rankings, Frasier, uh,

59
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:59,380
Nyp de Bleu entourage law and order,

60
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:04,510
CSI sex and the city king of Queens.
It goes on and on and on.

61
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:08,800
He's also a worldclass comic who travels
the globe performing standup comedy for

62
00:04:08,801 --> 00:04:10,630
sold out audiences all over the world.

63
00:04:10,631 --> 00:04:14,440
He's also one of the best
read people I've ever met.

64
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:17,710
So we're going to dig into all sorts
of things. The craft of comedy,

65
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:21,880
how he boost his boost is
boosts his own creativity,

66
00:04:21,881 --> 00:04:26,881
which sounds like I could stand to gain
from ideas for improving education,

67
00:04:26,951 --> 00:04:31,480
both self education and institutional
education. Uh, many different, uh,

68
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:33,820
book recommendations,
influences of his.

69
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,810
We really dig into a lot of
details that I found fascinating.

70
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:41,260
Brian's one of my favorite people to
hang out with. So without further ado,

71
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:46,330
here's Brian, Callan.
Ladies and gentlemen,

72
00:04:46,331 --> 00:04:49,570
this is Tim Ferriss and welcome
to the Tim Ferriss show.

73
00:04:49,571 --> 00:04:52,840
But we also have 50% of this episode,

74
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:57,430
which is the Brian Collins show. Brian,
welcome to the show. Thank you sir.

75
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,020
I am excited to have you on
for many different reasons,

76
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,950
not the least of which, as
we were discussing before
we started recording, uh,

77
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,830
you are known as the best body and comedy,
if I'm not mistaken.

78
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,200
That's right. And so just think
about, you guys don't have any videos.

79
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:16,150
Just think of a, if you were to take
human skin and stretch it over a Cheetah,

80
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:19,390
I think that's why that's not me.
That's just what my critic,

81
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,430
the critics, that's what, that's, that's,
that's the worst they can come up with.

82
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,930
Well, my admirer say, but that's
just, that's just what the critic

83
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,920
and uh, you know, I'm
trying to piece together,

84
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:36,750
it's been a number of years now,
but how did we first meet,

85
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:37,830
what was the first

86
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:41,620
Neil Brennan who is the
creator of the Chappelle show,

87
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,490
knew I was in the fitness
and all that and he sent me,

88
00:05:45,491 --> 00:05:50,110
I believe a Ted talk you had done
about a guy named Tim Ferriss. He said,

89
00:05:50,111 --> 00:05:53,620
what do you think of this guy?
And I, I watched it and I,

90
00:05:53,621 --> 00:05:56,710
and I was very taken with the way
you were explaining things and,

91
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:00,730
and how you use your body as a,
as a human Guinea pig. And I,

92
00:06:00,731 --> 00:06:04,340
I think I texted him back. I
said, well, I know one thing.

93
00:06:04,341 --> 00:06:08,140
I'm going to go out and get the
book, the four hour body. And, uh,

94
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:09,590
of course that sent me,
basically,

95
00:06:09,591 --> 00:06:11,990
I started with the four hour body and
then I got into the four hour work week.

96
00:06:11,991 --> 00:06:16,480
And then of course I listened to, uh, uh,
and then I read the four hour shifts. Um,

97
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:20,840
so I became sort of this, but what
I really, some of the concepts.
