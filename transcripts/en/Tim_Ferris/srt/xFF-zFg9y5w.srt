1
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:07,920
I always struggle with this
question in part because I,

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,810
this is going to sound so cliched,

3
00:00:09,811 --> 00:00:13,830
but I'm very forward marching and
that can be debilitating at times.

4
00:00:13,831 --> 00:00:17,760
I feel like I have blinders on that are
just looking towards the future. Uh,

5
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,820
and sometimes that affects me because
it prevents me from reflecting well on

6
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,300
mistakes. But the first
that comes to mind, uh,

7
00:00:27,301 --> 00:00:29,160
and this was not just a mistake,

8
00:00:29,161 --> 00:00:34,161
it was maybe a collection
of what I perceived at the
time it'd be disasters was

9
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:35,310
in college,

10
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:40,550
Undergrad when I had a huge
dispute with my thesis advisor.

11
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,010
I also felt like I was being
funneled into one of two industries,

12
00:00:47,011 --> 00:00:49,980
management consulting or investment
banking. This is at Princeton.

13
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,470
Very few industries come to recruit there.

14
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:58,190
And as a competitor I was compelled,

15
00:00:59,011 --> 00:01:03,660
I felt compelled just as I had
in school to try to get a is etc.

16
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:07,980
To compete for the McKinseys
and Goldman Sachs of the world.

17
00:01:07,981 --> 00:01:11,160
And I remember getting through one
round of interviews and just thinking to

18
00:01:11,161 --> 00:01:14,220
myself,
I don't want to do either of these things,

19
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:17,970
but everyone else wants them.
Therefore,

20
00:01:17,971 --> 00:01:21,960
perhaps I should want them to. And
that's a big, big warning signal.

21
00:01:21,961 --> 00:01:25,050
That's a red flag.
It took me awhile to identify that.

22
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,900
And with the help of an entrepreneurship,
high tech entrepreneurship,

23
00:01:27,901 --> 00:01:31,950
teaching them Ed Shao, Z, s,
c, h, a u, incredible man.

24
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,510
But due to the issues with my thesis,

25
00:01:36,511 --> 00:01:39,000
I wasn't going to finish it
on time for a host of reasons.

26
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:43,980
If people want to learn more
about that, they can look up, uh,

27
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,040
some thoughts on suicide,

28
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:52,070
pretty intense and morbid title or some
practical thoughts on suicide and my

29
00:01:52,381 --> 00:01:53,520
name and it should pop right up.

30
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:57,720
But I went into a deep depression
after leaving Princeton for a year.

31
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:01,710
So I decided to take a year off to
do two things to work on the thesis.

32
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:05,100
And I was told very
surprisingly by my advisor,

33
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:07,800
better be the best thesis I've ever seen.
In effect,

34
00:02:07,801 --> 00:02:10,230
I'm going to give you a
terrible, terrible grade. Um,

35
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:13,320
and there's a lot of background there
I won't bore people with right now. Um,

36
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:17,730
but I felt like I was completely
trapped in a corner with that end. Uh,

37
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,810
on the positive side,

38
00:02:18,811 --> 00:02:23,811
I decided to test working at
companies of different sizes.

39
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,050
So I worked at Berlitz for a period of
time helping to redesign some of their

40
00:02:28,051 --> 00:02:30,570
Japanese instruction curriculum.

41
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:36,380
And I also worked at a political asylum
research firm and that was very small,

42
00:02:38,311 --> 00:02:41,070
two or three people and I learned a lot.

43
00:02:41,071 --> 00:02:45,060
So where it led me was realizing I
didn't want to work in a company of say

44
00:02:45,061 --> 00:02:48,390
10,000 people or many thousands of people,
which Berlitz was,

45
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,530
and I was working remotely.

46
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:52,470
So I also realized there was a social
component that was really important to me.

47
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:57,330
I liked to work around people,
even if my team were remote,

48
00:02:57,331 --> 00:03:00,880
I want it to be surrounded by people
and ended up at home by myself a lot.

49
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:02,830
And it was mentally destructive.

50
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:09,120
The political asylum research
was fantastic because it
really put my issues at

51
00:03:10,331 --> 00:03:13,480
that time into perspective because
I was dealing with people who were,

52
00:03:13,481 --> 00:03:17,800
let's just say homosexuals in a country
where they were going to be killed or

53
00:03:17,801 --> 00:03:22,330
had been threatened with death where
family members had been killed or for

54
00:03:22,331 --> 00:03:26,400
religious differences. And
they were filing for asylum
in the United States, uh,

55
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,810
to try to escape this type of persecution.

56
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:33,960
And my job was to find experts who could
be witnesses and determine what they

57
00:03:34,031 --> 00:03:38,080
would call the meritorious
nature of these cases and, uh,

58
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:42,670
brutal work because there were
instances where their case was valid.

59
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:47,670
But for a host of technicalities or
process reasons in the U s system of

60
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:51,040
addressing such things, we couldn't help
them. And so literally it'd be like,

61
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:51,903
sorry,

62
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:54,340
you have to go back to this country where
you're probably going to be killed or

63
00:03:54,341 --> 00:03:58,540
your family's going to be killed, or
your kids are going to be, um, attacked.

64
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:00,040
And that those very,

65
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:04,250
very brutal but very helpful at
the same time for putting my, uh,

66
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:08,440
first of all problems should we say into
perspective which Nola serious, uh, in,

67
00:04:08,441 --> 00:04:13,390
in many respects I should point out I
don't fetishize that like a lot of people.

68
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,910
And the,

69
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:21,540
the very process of having to contend
with these existential issues,

70
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:26,970
seeing my classmates graduate a graduate
a year before me because I went back to

71
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:30,820
school, I felt completely alone
during this period of a year.

72
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:32,950
And it reinforced a few things for me,

73
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:36,400
like the importance of exercise.

74
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,520
So that is when I focused on boxing.
I went to this gym in Trenton.

75
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:42,760
I don't know if I've talked about this
stuff before. Went to a gym in Trenton.

76
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:46,420
I was the only white guy there. Uh,
almost everyone was on work release.

77
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:49,300
And I remember the first workout,
they're like, oh, let's see how you move.

78
00:04:49,301 --> 00:04:52,690
They put me in the ring with this guy
who was a heavyweight and immediately

79
00:04:52,691 --> 00:04:55,000
broke my nose and just bled everywhere.

80
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:59,230
And people laughed initially and
then they were like, Jesus, this is,

81
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,260
this guy's bleeding all over the ring.

82
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:07,200
And pulled me out and I kept training
there and that from that point on they

83
00:05:07,201 --> 00:05:10,810
were fine with me. But uh, the exercises,

84
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:15,160
what kept me sane and that's when I
did the kickboxing training and so on.

85
00:05:15,161 --> 00:05:18,670
That led to the nationals later in 1999.
That's when that was.

86
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,550
And that story ended up
in the four hour workweek.

87
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,390
So a lot of these existential
issues led me to make decisions.

88
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:30,420
Then this is leading to a better thing
coming back into school and continuing to

89
00:05:32,621 --> 00:05:37,621
study under Ed Shell and
look at entrepreneurship
and starting my own thing as

90
00:05:38,081 --> 00:05:41,620
the path as opposed to
having forged ahead,

91
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:46,480
perhaps looking back on it, trying to
spin it with some silver lining. If my,

92
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:51,280
if, if I hadn't had the issues in college
that I did that led me to drop out and

93
00:05:51,281 --> 00:05:55,600
have all of that pain,
there's a very nontrivial chance,

94
00:05:55,601 --> 00:05:59,390
let's just call it 60 70% chance that
I would have ended up at a Mckinsey or

95
00:05:59,391 --> 00:06:01,850
Goldman Sachs.
Nothing wrong with those things.

96
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:06,740
There are some people who are just
hardwired to succeed in those environments

97
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:07,790
and they're perfect fit.

98
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:12,290
But you can't take an undergraduate body
of 5,000 people and just divvy it up

99
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:15,410
into two industries and expect
everyone to be a good fit. I wasn't,

100
00:06:15,411 --> 00:06:18,500
but there's a very good chance I would
have ended up in one of those career

101
00:06:18,501 --> 00:06:20,750
paths and I think it
would have been miserable.

102
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:25,060
I think therefore would not have been
terribly good at it and I would've had

103
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:29,360
ended up changing direction
five, 10, 20 years later.

104
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:33,740
And instead the universe kicked me in the
nuts and uppercutted me in the fucking

105
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:37,580
teeth.
And that was a good thing.

106
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,790
So in the span of six months,

107
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:45,050
I figured out what could have taken me
10 to 15 years to figure out. So, uh,

108
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:49,240
thanks for that universe. I don't need
too many of those in my life. Uh, but uh,

109
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:53,600
at the time, uh, that was a good course
correction. If you enjoyed this video,

110
