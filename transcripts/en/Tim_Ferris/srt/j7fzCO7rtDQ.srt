1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,810
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02,811 --> 00:00:06,150
I can run flat out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:07,900
You posted a question.

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,330
I'm a cybernetic organism,
living tissue.

5
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:27,870
This episode is brought to
you by Wealthfront and this
is a very unique sponsor.

6
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,670
Wealthfront is a massively disruptive
in a good way, set it and forget it.

7
00:00:32,671 --> 00:00:37,020
Investing service led by technologists
from places like apple and world famous

8
00:00:37,021 --> 00:00:37,770
investors.

9
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,460
It has exploded in popularity in the last
two years and they now have more than

10
00:00:41,461 --> 00:00:44,490
two and a half billion dollars
under management. In fact,

11
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,840
some of my very good friends,

12
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,050
investors in silicon valley have millions
of their own money in Wealthfront.

13
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,110
So the question is why? Why is
it so popular? Why is it unique?

14
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:56,400
Because you can get services previously
reserved for the ultra wealthy but only

15
00:00:56,401 --> 00:00:58,410
pay pennies on the dollar for them.

16
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,130
And this is because they use smarter
software instead of retail locations,

17
00:01:02,131 --> 00:01:04,860
bloated sales teams, et cetera. And
I'll come back to that in a second.

18
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:10,020
I suggest you check out wealthfront.com
forward slash Tim take the risk

19
00:01:10,021 --> 00:01:13,290
assessment quiz which only takes two to
five minutes and they'll show you for

20
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:17,100
free exactly the portfolio they'd put
you in and if you just want to take their

21
00:01:17,101 --> 00:01:21,000
advice, run with it, do it yourself.
You can do that or as I would,

22
00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:22,890
you can set it and
forget it and here's why.

23
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:27,210
The value of Wealthfront is in the
automation of habits and strategies that

24
00:01:27,211 --> 00:01:31,680
investors should be using on a regular
basis but normally aren't great investing

25
00:01:31,681 --> 00:01:33,300
is a marathon,
not a sprint,

26
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,990
and little things that you may or may
not be familiar with like automatic tax

27
00:01:36,991 --> 00:01:39,120
loss harvesting,
rebalancing your portfolio,

28
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,620
cross more than 10 asset classes and
dividend reinvestment add up to very large

29
00:01:43,621 --> 00:01:47,310
amounts of money over longer periods
of time. Wealthfront, as I mentioned,

30
00:01:47,311 --> 00:01:49,920
since it's using software
instead of retail locations,

31
00:01:49,921 --> 00:01:54,120
etc. Can offer all of this at low
costs that were previously completely

32
00:01:54,121 --> 00:01:55,590
impossible right off the bat,

33
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:58,140
you never pay commissions or
account fees for everything.

34
00:01:58,141 --> 00:02:03,141
They charge 0.25% per year on assets above
the first 15,000 which is managed for

35
00:02:03,781 --> 00:02:07,470
free. If you use my link,
wealthfront.com forward slash Tim,

36
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:12,630
that is less than $5 a month to invest
a $30,000 account for instance. Now,

37
00:02:12,631 --> 00:02:14,250
normally when I have a
sponsor on this show,

38
00:02:14,251 --> 00:02:17,790
it's because I use them and
recommend them. In this case,
it's a little different.

39
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:22,110
I don't use Wealthfront yet because
I'm not allowed to. Here's the deal.

40
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:26,370
They wanted to sponsor this podcast,
but because of sec regulations,

41
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:30,030
companies that invest your money are
not allowed to use client testimonials.

42
00:02:30,031 --> 00:02:32,850
So I couldn't be a user end
have them on the podcast,

43
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,960
but I've been so impressed by Wealthfront
that I've invested a significant

44
00:02:36,961 --> 00:02:40,800
amount of my own money, at least for me,
uh, in the team and the company itself.

45
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:43,950
So I am an investor and hope
to soon use it as a client.

46
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:47,430
Now back to the recommendation
as a Tim Ferriss show listener,

47
00:02:47,431 --> 00:02:51,300
you'll get $15,000 managed for free
if you decide to open an account.

48
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,330
But just start with seeing the portfolio
that they would suggest for you.

49
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:58,530
Take two minutes, fill out their
questionnaire@wealthfront.com
forward slash. Tim,

50
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,920
it's fast,
it's free.

51
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,600
There's no downside that I can think of.

52
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,010

to you by 99 designs.

he, she booties on the, uh, my friends.

69
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:04,230
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another
episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

70
00:04:04,231 --> 00:04:07,530
it is my job to deconstruct
world class performers,

71
00:04:07,531 --> 00:04:12,030
whether they be from the world
of chess, entertainment, sports,

72
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,700
military,
or in this case,

73
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,820
generalized Human Guinea pig.

74
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:23,610
And that means my guest is a comrade
in arms of sorts in this wacky world of

75
00:04:25,021 --> 00:04:26,910
self experimentation.
Aga Jacobs,

76
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,500
one of my favorite people out there at
Aga Jacobs on Twitter and elsewhere is

77
00:04:31,501 --> 00:04:34,080
the author of four New
York Times bestsellers.

78
00:04:34,081 --> 00:04:36,690
And he chronicles all
sorts of Shenanigans.

79
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,690
His books include the know it all,

80
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:43,710
which was about his quest to read the
entire Encyclopedia Britannica and learn

81
00:04:43,711 --> 00:04:47,580
everything in the world. And, uh, in
case you haven't picked this up yet.

82
00:04:47,581 --> 00:04:49,500
He is a hilarious,
hilarious human being.

83
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:54,000
The year of living biblically about his
quest to follow all of the rules of the

84
00:04:54,001 --> 00:04:57,780
Bible as literally as possible.
Fantastic,

85
00:04:57,781 --> 00:05:02,040
fantastic book drop dead healthy about
his quest to become the healthiest person

86
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:05,070
alive, uh, in which, uh,

87
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:08,430
with many a ill advised and
sometimes well advised experiments.

88
00:05:08,431 --> 00:05:11,100
I was involved as one of said advisers,

89
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:16,310
the Guinea pig diaries collection of
various mishaps but also insightful quests

90
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:21,390
like outsourcing his entire life and
radical honesty. It's all relative.

91
00:05:21,391 --> 00:05:22,700
We're just coming out in 2017.

92
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:27,710
So that has to be read about a quest to
connect all of humanity in one family

93
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:32,880
tree. He is also the host of the new
podcast twice removed by gimlet media.

94
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:35,160
Of course,
they are the blockbuster factory.

95
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,000
The podcast that is twice removed
is about finding connections.

96
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:42,720
Aja takes a celebrity guests and at the
end of each episode of introduces them

97
00:05:42,721 --> 00:05:44,940
to a surprise cousin they
didn't know they had.

98
00:05:44,941 --> 00:05:48,690
So it could be one of their heroes and old
friend, a teacher, et Cetera, et cetera.

99
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:52,080
AJ and I talk about a lot in this episode.
We talk about some of his habits,

100
00:05:52,081 --> 00:05:55,860
what he's learned from many of these
experiments we talk about his creative

101
00:05:55,861 --> 00:06:00,410
process has writing certain
tipping points in his life. Uh,

102
00:06:00,411 --> 00:06:04,610
how he learned to love marketing as an
author who distinct it for very, very,

103
00:06:04,611 --> 00:06:07,550
very long time and a lot more.

104
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:11,690
We cover a lot of ground and I think
you will have a blast. That's my hope.

105
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,340
I hope you enjoy listening to it as
much as I enjoyed chatting with Aja.

106
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,530
So without further ado,
as I always say,

107
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,860
please enjoy my wide ranging
conversation with a Jay Jacobs.

108
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,290
Aja? Good sir. Welcome to the show.

109
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:29,510
Thank you Tim.
Delighted to be here

110
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:33,480
and I thought we could start
maybe at the beginning.

111
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:37,650
How did we meet? I remember
specifically where I was sitting.

112
00:06:37,651 --> 00:06:39,450
We had our first conversation,

113
00:06:39,451 --> 00:06:42,480
but how did I reach out to you
or was it through the website?

114
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,400
It was great.
Yes,

115
00:06:44,401 --> 00:06:49,401
it was either an email but then we talked
on the phone soon after and you said,

116
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,650
I'm a first time writer.
I'm writing a book.

117
00:06:52,651 --> 00:06:56,460
At that point it was called
drug dealing for fun and profit.

118
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:01,680
And you said you had read an article I
had written where I outsourced my life to

119
00:07:01,681 --> 00:07:05,310
India, so hired a team of people in
Bangalore to do everything for me,

120
00:07:05,311 --> 00:07:08,990
like answer my email
and argue with my wife.

121
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:14,230
And you said that you were writing a
book about a similar topic of trying to

122
00:07:15,171 --> 00:07:20,171
find ways to hack work and could you
talk to me about it and could you reprint

123
00:07:20,631 --> 00:07:24,750
that in your book? And I
was like, well this guy,

124
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:29,460
like he's writing a book about drug
dealing, I don't know, should I trust him?

125
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:33,170
And I'm like, you know
what the hell. So it,

126
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:36,630
it came out and then the
vast part was a year later,

127
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:41,800
like I had forgotten about it and I
got a call from you and you're like,

128
00:07:41,801 --> 00:07:44,140
my book's coming out in case
you want to check it out.

129
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,750
And it's number one on Amazon.
And I'm like,

130
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:51,010
you mean number one in like 20
something career advice. You're like,

131
00:07:51,011 --> 00:07:54,670
no number one on Amazon,
you are a genius.

132
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:59,800
How the hell did you do that? The
first time writer. So now I'm like,

133
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:02,680
uh, yeah, and now you are
my mentor in publishing.

134
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:06,610
Like you called me for advice
and now like I need to,

135
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,100
a year later I needed
to call you for advice.

136
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:14,430
This is my chance to ask for more advice.
Aha.

137
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:19,460
Because I realized that we talked about
your writing at the time and we're going

138
00:08:19,461 --> 00:08:21,670
to get into all sorts of experiments.
But since,

139
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,350
since we were talking about writing,

140
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:28,740
a number of people in my fan base asked
about your writing process and so we've

141
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:32,680
talked about your writing,
the subject matter of your writing,

142
00:08:32,681 --> 00:08:36,070
but I don't know if we've ever
talked about your writing process.

143
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:40,630
Yeah, I'm happy to talk about it. I think
we actually did because when you were,

144
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:43,220
you were researching how to write a book.

145
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:48,620
That's true. I asked him, I asked you a
little bit about structure. Yeah. And uh,

146
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:51,470
but I don't know at the time
I remember I was in Argentina,

147
00:08:51,471 --> 00:08:53,720
I was in Buenos Aires.
So sitting in a coffee shop,

148
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:59,000
drinking a Cappuccino,
which was a double espresso.

149
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:00,860
This must have been around,
uh,

150
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:06,130
late 2005 or early 2006 near this place.

151
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:10,870
Well, it's a large cemetery
and in near plus a fancy,

152
00:09:10,871 --> 00:09:13,360
I remember exactly where I was
sitting when we had the conversation.

153
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:16,430
Could you describe for folks,
like I said,

154
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,730
there are two questions
about writing process.

155
00:09:18,731 --> 00:09:23,260
One is micro on say a daily basis
when you are writing a book,

156
00:09:23,261 --> 00:09:24,670
what that day looks like.

157
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:29,350
And then there's the how do you
decide what to write about. So,

158
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:34,530
which do you want to tackle
first? Whichever you would
like to tackle first. Well,

159
00:09:34,531 --> 00:09:38,340
let me take, tackle the micro
really quickly, which would be,

160
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:43,680
mmm. One thing I like to
do first a little, uh,

161
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,020
mental calisthenics before
I start writing. So, uh,

162
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:51,390
just to warm up my brain,
so I'll, I'll brainstorm.

163
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,300
Maybe it's about the book
event itself or an article,

164
00:09:54,301 --> 00:09:58,760
but it could just be random stuff. Like it
could be like, you know, ah, I saw snow,

165
00:09:58,761 --> 00:10:03,600
man, what can we do with that? Maybe
we could do a, uh, uh, Snow Tran,

166
00:10:03,601 --> 00:10:06,910
ginger person or us know neanderthal like,

167
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,260
and 99% of the ideas suck as you can tell.

168
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,590
But the idea is just to get
your creative juices flowing.

169
00:10:14,591 --> 00:10:16,830
You get writing those down or are
you just doing them and said, yes,

170
00:10:16,831 --> 00:10:20,970
I'm typing them down. And you
know, as I say, none of them,

171
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,030
very few of them are ever
see the light of day.

172
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:27,660
But that's just to get my
fingers typing is another thing.

173
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:32,690
I feel just the movement of my fingers
on the key gets me revved up and gets me,

174
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,080
uh, so that uh, I'm,

175
00:10:37,081 --> 00:10:38,640
I'm more comfortable typing.

176
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
The other thing I like to think about
is I know that the first half hour of of

177
00:10:45,031 --> 00:10:49,180
actual writing my book that
that is probably going to suck.

178
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:54,720
And so I just have to accept that
and be okay with throwing it out.

179
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:59,920
But you got to do that half hour
before a year, your brain clicks in.

180
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,920
So, so that's what I do. I do need,

181
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:06,940
I do need like three solid hours.
I am not one.

182
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:10,600
Some people can do it where they
can write in spurts of 20 minutes.

183
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,950
I am not one of those.

184
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:13,350
I can't do it either.
Yeah.

185
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:18,710
And I remember I got some very good advice
a few years ago because I was getting

186
00:11:19,171 --> 00:11:21,840
very frustrated by the,

187
00:11:21,841 --> 00:11:26,400
in my mind wasted half hour that
you mentioned. Uh, and someone said,

188
00:11:26,401 --> 00:11:30,990
well you have to realize that if you
write 10 pages and you only get one really

189
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:35,190
good page at the very end,
those nine pages are not a waste of time.

190
00:11:35,191 --> 00:11:38,940
You needed those nine pages to get to
the 10th page. Yeah, exactly. Okay.

191
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:41,520
I prefer to have a better ratio.
I'll take it.

192
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,370
No. Yeah, there is some warm up. Uh, yeah.

193
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,440
I wish it could be more
like high intensity interval
training. You're Indian,

194
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:50,770
you're out. But it is
more like stretching. And

195
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:54,070
do you tend to do it first thing
in the morning or when do you I do,

196
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:58,210
well, I have kids so that, that
makes my life a pain in the ass.

197
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,140
So I have had to train myself
to tie it to write at all hours.

198
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:07,360
So sometimes in the morning, sometimes
at night. And uh, do you drink coffee?

199
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:11,500
Do you drink coffee? Um, I also,

200
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:15,040
I have to say I enjoy my white wine.
Uh,

201
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:19,210
mostly mornings I am a day drinker.

202
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:23,260
I actually prefer drinking during
the day. Um, but yeah, you know,

203
00:12:23,261 --> 00:12:27,730
there are studies that show that you're
slightly more creative after like I

204
00:12:27,731 --> 00:12:30,640
think after one glass,
like after two or three glasses,

205
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:35,560
then it all goes to hell. But one
glass, it sort of loosens up the, uh,

206
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:39,490
the frontal cortex allows
you to make more connections

207
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:43,530
or it convinces you that you should be
more loosened up and you have the placebo

208
00:12:43,531 --> 00:12:45,660
effect benefit there.
You Guy, and you said,

209
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:50,640
you sent me over a quote and I don't know
if this is a quote of yours or if it's

210
00:12:50,641 --> 00:12:51,690
tributed to someone else,

211
00:12:51,691 --> 00:12:55,620
but I really enjoyed this and I think
it applies to a lot of what you do,

212
00:12:55,621 --> 00:12:59,850
not just your writing, but
it, here's the quote quote,

213
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,990
it's easier to act your way into a new
way of thinking than to think your way

214
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:05,310
into a new way of acting.

215
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:11,270
Can you elaborate on that or provide
us some more context for that?

216
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:14,800
Yeah, I love that quote and I
think it applies to both of us.

217
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:18,580
Definitely applies to both of us. Yeah.
I think a lot of what your work and yeah,

218
00:13:18,581 --> 00:13:19,870
I wish I could say I made it up.

219
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:23,920
It was the founder of habitat for
humanity whose name escapes me right now,

220
00:13:23,921 --> 00:13:28,570
but it was a wonderful, and
the idea is just, you know, uh,

221
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:32,800
when you is, it's basic
cognitive behavioral psychology.

222
00:13:32,801 --> 00:13:36,970
When you act in a certain way,
then your brain will catch up.

223
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:42,420
But that's a lot of insight in terms
of change. I find that much easier.

224
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:46,640
Like I wrote a book about the Bible
and living by the Bible and one of the

225
00:13:46,641 --> 00:13:49,940
things was you had to be
more compassionate and a,

226
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:55,590
so I had a friend in the hospital, I
hate hospitals, hate them. So I was like,

227
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,720
I'm not going to visit that guy.
But then I thought,

228
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:01,120
what would a compassionate person do?

229
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,480
And I acted as if I were
a compassionate person.

230
00:14:04,481 --> 00:14:06,670
I forced myself to go to
the hospital and visit him.

231
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,660
And then in my brain I'm like, oh, you
know what, I am kind of compassionate.

232
00:14:10,661 --> 00:14:14,650
You sort of trick your brain,
your brain catches up. Uh, and,

233
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:18,760
and I've done that and especially with
optimism and confidence, you know,

234
00:14:18,761 --> 00:14:20,860
I don't think I'm a
naturally confident person,

235
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:25,861
but I act as if I'm confident and
eventually you become more confident.

236
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,210
So what

237
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:32,060
in the realm of confidence would
embodies confidence for you?

238
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,800
It's like what are the
ways in which you act?

239
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:37,330
Well, for instance, when I
wrote a book about health,

240
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:40,930
it was a sort of my um,
my uh,

241
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:44,320
attempt at the four hour body, uh, and uh,

242
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,720
Aye I was so overwhelmed because it's
such a huge topic and I was trying to be

243
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:53,260
the healthiest person alive
aside from Tim Ferris. Uh,

244
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:55,760
and so there was such a,

245
00:14:55,761 --> 00:15:00,170
it's such an undertaking because there's
so much their sleep and their sacks and

246
00:15:00,171 --> 00:15:02,990
there's food and exercise.
So I was all stressed out,

247
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:07,160
but then I acted every morning
I would wake up full of despair,

248
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:11,210
but then I would act as if
I was confident. So I would
call my publisher and say,

249
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:14,360
okay,
when we have the release party,

250
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,360
let's have a Kale Martinis.
What do you think of that? Uh,

251
00:15:18,361 --> 00:15:20,490
so I was acting all cocky as if you know,

252
00:15:20,491 --> 00:15:22,200
this is going to come
out and be a big hit.

253
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:27,060
And after two or three hours your brain
catches up and I actually felt more

254
00:15:27,061 --> 00:15:29,670
confident and I really find it so helpful.

255
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:34,080
So I've, I've been thinking
about this a lot recently, uh,

256
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:39,160
because there's so much talk of,
of mind over body.

257
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:42,310
And so this is I guess a
corollary to this quote,

258
00:15:42,311 --> 00:15:45,550
but I've been thinking a lot
about, uh, body over mind.

259
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,290
And this is something Tony
Robbins talks a lot about.

260
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:51,400
If you want to change your psychology,
changing your physiology first,

261
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:56,850
and it's a lot easier also in the sense
that if you haven't reasoned yourself

262
00:15:57,801 --> 00:16:00,320
into a position of say,
lack of confidence,

263
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:02,030
or at least you haven't
done it consciously,

264
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:06,710
it's very hard to reason your way out of
it. Uh, so you just have to act as if,

265
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:11,440
oh yeah, I absolutely, I agree.
And it's in every part of my life.

266
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:16,270
Like I did one experiment where I, I
tried to be the best husband ever, and,

267
00:16:16,271 --> 00:16:17,104
uh,

268
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:22,510
I forced myself to buy a
present for my wife every day,

269
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,990
like just a little trinket.
Uh,

270
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:29,040
even if I was totally pissed at her and
like you want to, nothing to do with her,

271
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:34,290
but just that act of giving it to her, it
was like, oh, I'm giving her a present.

272
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:37,920
I must love her.
And it really changed my view.

273
00:16:37,921 --> 00:16:41,340
So I am a big fan and there, and
we're not the only ones. You know, I,

274
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:45,990
I read about Teddy Roosevelt
when he was a, he for a while,

275
00:16:45,991 --> 00:16:48,690
he was trying to be a cowboy.
He was actually in,

276
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,100
I think it was Montana and someone asked
him, aren't you terrified? And he's like,

277
00:16:53,101 --> 00:16:55,530
of course I'm terrified when
the bullets is coming at me,

278
00:16:55,531 --> 00:17:00,270
but I just act as if I'm courageous
and they become a little more correct.

279
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:05,220
Yes. So it sounds like, and I read
this comparison on I think 99 you,

280
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:11,110
uh, one piece, maybe method acting,
although I know nothing about it.

281
00:17:11,111 --> 00:17:15,640
I'm just using the label. Uh, and
then there's the second component,

282
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,490
which is something that,
uh, I, I didn't, I,

283
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:25,530
I like this phrase and it's capital
d capital owed delusional optimism.

284
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:31,030
Uh, can you, can you elaborate
on that? Cause it seems
like there they go together.

285
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:35,720
Yes. I am a, I am a fan
of delusional optimism,

286
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,520
which is very similar to what
we've been talking about. Uh,

287
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:43,010
I think it's nothing would get
done without delusional optimism.

288
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,173
And I actually,

289
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:48,740
one example as I interviewed
George Clooney once for a Esquire,

290
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:53,340
who by the way is as charming
as you expect George Clooney to.

291
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:58,080
He gave me a, a
unsolicited, a shoulder rub,

292
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:02,250
shoulder massage, so that like,
I'll always have that. Uh,

293
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:05,280
but anyways,
so I asked him about his,

294
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:09,690
whether his secret to success and
he said one philosophy he has his,

295
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:10,710
uh,

296
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:15,060
he used to be a baseball player in high
school and when he got up to the plate,

297
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:19,150
he would, he wouldn't just say to
himself, am I going to hit a home run?

298
00:18:19,151 --> 00:18:22,400
He would say,
not only am I going to hit a home run,

299
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:26,880
but the only question is am I going to
hit it over the left wall or the right

300
00:18:26,881 --> 00:18:31,830
wall? And I loved that just like, and
of course, most of the time he did it,

301
00:18:31,831 --> 00:18:33,090
most of the time he struck out,

302
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:38,091
but it raised the percentage of times
that he did hit a home run because he had

303
00:18:38,281 --> 00:18:43,110
that delusional optimism. Uh, and I love
that. And you have to be careful. I mean,

304
00:18:43,111 --> 00:18:47,580
you don't want, it can lead to terrible
things. So you have to have some,

305
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,940
especially if you're in an organization,
you want the CEO to be delusional,

306
00:18:50,941 --> 00:18:55,110
he off to a optimistic and then you
want someone else to be sort of the bean

307
00:18:55,111 --> 00:19:00,060
counter and be like, I don't
know about this, a balance.
But you really do, I think,

308
00:19:00,061 --> 00:19:02,820
need that delusional
optimism to get things done.

309
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:08,570
And if we're then rewinding a little bit
and going from the micro book process,

310
00:19:09,811 --> 00:19:12,060
book writing process,
uh,

311
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:15,540
actually before we leave
the daily writing process,

312
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:20,880
I've talked to a lot of my friends
who are typically journalists that in

313
00:19:20,881 --> 00:19:25,881
newspapers and they drive me crazy and
they make me very envious because they

314
00:19:26,371 --> 00:19:31,371
talk about how writing or writer's block
doesn't exist and they can kick out

315
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:36,120
1500 beautiful words every few hours
and they seem to be able to do it.

316
00:19:36,121 --> 00:19:40,300
A lot of my friends who've worked
at different papers do you have,

317
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:45,430
do you experience blocks
or extended periods where
you're just stuck on projects

318
00:19:45,431 --> 00:19:49,390
and if so, what do you do to help get
yourself out of those folks? Yep. Yeah,

319
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:49,790
blocked

320
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:52,670
all the time. I actually
wrote an article once on, uh,

321
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:56,630
on writer's block and the way that
great writers have overcome it.

322
00:19:57,050 --> 00:20:00,770
I remember, uh, I think Ben
Franklin wrote in the nude,

323
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:05,720
a lot of writers wrote standing
up like a Nabokov wrote,

324
00:20:05,721 --> 00:20:09,770
standing up. There is a philosopher
and German philosopher named Schiller,

325
00:20:09,771 --> 00:20:14,660
who he needed rotten apples to
inspire him. So I tried them.

326
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:18,560
I've went, like Tim Ferriss, I, I
tried them all like at the same time,

327
00:20:18,561 --> 00:20:22,640
like standing up naked
with rotten rotten apples.

328
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,350
I don't know if that was successful,

329
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:28,820
but I will say one of them is similar to
what I said before where you just start

330
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:31,670
writing and it doesn't have to be,

331
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:37,040
as long as you accept that it's going
to suck, uh, it lowers the pressure.

332
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:41,150
So I'll, a lot of times
if I, uh, if I'm stuck,

333
00:20:41,151 --> 00:20:44,390
I'll just start writing,
you know, about the, the,

334
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:49,060
the Coffee Cup or the
on the window sill are,

335
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:52,870
you know, how, um, my
elbow itches and just,

336
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,610
just the fact of moving your fingers,

337
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:59,180
like we talked about how much
your body affects your mind,

338
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:04,500
moving the fingers gets you
going, uh, and helps. But yeah,

339
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:07,550
I, it's a problem. It is a certainly, uh,

340
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,910
people who say they don't have writer's
block, they, they drive me crazy.

341
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,173
And uh,

342
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,530
you mentioned this is going to jump
around because it's the style of my mental

343
00:21:17,531 --> 00:21:19,780
like brain.
But you mentioned,

344
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:22,370
and this is a question that
came up from quite a few, uh,

345
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:27,580
listeners to the podcast, the year
of living biblically, which was, uh,

346
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,120
one of my favorite books. Yours. I really,

347
00:21:30,121 --> 00:21:31,650
really enjoyed it and
I've told you this before,

348
00:21:31,651 --> 00:21:34,710
but I learned more about
as someone who developed a,

349
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:40,400
an allergy to organized religion pretty
early on and therefore it never learned

350
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:41,610
much about it.

351
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:45,690
It was a fantastic Trojan horse for me
through the entertainment value in the

352
00:21:45,691 --> 00:21:50,580
humor of the book to actually learn a
lot about a number of different religious

353
00:21:50,581 --> 00:21:55,290
traditions. Well bless you. Bless
you Tim. Thanks. So while that,

354
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:58,230
bless you, that leads me to
the question, which is, uh,

355
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,180
what are the things that
have stuck with you?

356
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,250
Yeah,
that and

357
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:03,840
because there's one that stuck with me,

358
00:22:03,841 --> 00:22:07,350
which railings a while you talked
about wearing white. Ah, yeah.

359
00:22:07,351 --> 00:22:10,740
And so maybe you could, you could,
you could explain what that means,

360
00:22:10,741 --> 00:22:13,590
but it's actually something that I've
ended up doing on a fairly regular basis

361
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:14,603
since I run me.

362
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:18,030
Although you're wearing dark blue and
wearing dark blue right now cause all my

363
00:22:18,031 --> 00:22:18,864
wife's stuff is,

364
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:23,640
imagine how much better this interview
would be. And, and I was wearing light.

365
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:26,910
I'm wearing white socks.
Uh, yeah. Well this book,

366
00:22:26,911 --> 00:22:30,020
just to give a very quick background
for those who don't know it was, um,

367
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:33,870
I grew up with no religion at all.
Uh, as I say in the book, I'm Jewish,

368
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:38,070
but I'm Jewish in the same way. The
olive garden is Italian, so not very,

369
00:22:38,071 --> 00:22:38,850
no offense,

370
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:43,800
but I thought one way to learn about
religion would be to dive in and actually

371
00:22:43,801 --> 00:22:48,150
follow every rule in the Bible. So the
famous ones like the 10 Commandments,

372
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:51,090
uh, and, but also the last famous ones,

373
00:22:51,091 --> 00:22:53,640
like it says you can't shave
the corners of your beard.

374
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:56,910
I didn't know where the corners were,
so I just let the whole thing grow.

375
00:22:56,911 --> 00:23:01,440
And I had this huge topiary and I got
stopped at airport security. So it was,

376
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:06,340
hey, uh, it was a, it was a
crazy year, but one of the rules,

377
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,460
the robes probably didn't help it.
Airports

378
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,570
and the sandals and the walking
stick. Yeah. Has He say, you know,

379
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,150
getting into it physically
really makes a difference.

380
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:19,540
And one of the rules in the Bible,
and I think it's Ecclesiastes,

381
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:24,220
he says that your garments should always
be white. So I took that literally,

382
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,970
and I only wore white pants,
white shirts and white robes.

383
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:32,800
And it was weird how it affected my,
uh,

384
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,410
my mind as, you know, like,

385
00:23:35,411 --> 00:23:39,880
it made me feel lighter or more energetic,

386
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:44,140
uh, and I felt like, you know, it's,

387
00:23:44,141 --> 00:23:49,010
there's just something wearing white,
like I'm going to, you know, uh,

388
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:53,460
p Diddy's Hamptons party or I'm gonna
play Wimbledon, you know, it's, it's,

389
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:58,190
it's got positive associations.
So I fell.

390
00:23:58,191 --> 00:24:02,060
And here in New York, people wear dark
clothes all the time. And I think door,

391
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:05,610
yeah, it affects your,
your mind have, you can,

392
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:10,640
is that continued to be a piece or what
have continued to play a part in your

393
00:24:11,481 --> 00:24:15,830
life from that book, from that experience?
I do like the little brighter clothes,

394
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:20,320
more than I used to. I, I would
say, you know, a lot of it I,

395
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:25,310
I gave, I did shave the beard,
um, because my wife would not,

396
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:29,210
she wouldn't touch me with that thing.
Uh, even though I kept very clean,

397
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:31,920
I like moisturized,
conditioned it.

398
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:37,210
Shampooed but in terms of stuff
that I have actually kept,

399
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:40,970
uh,
I would say one thing that,

400
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:45,800
that really has stuck with me is that
the Bible talks about that you should be

401
00:24:45,801 --> 00:24:49,730
grateful all the time. He says he should
be thankful, say prayers of thanksgiving.

402
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:54,770
So I, when I was doing
the, the book, I would, I,

403
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:57,740
I took that literally,
so I would be thankful for everything.

404
00:24:57,741 --> 00:25:01,400
So I would press the elevator button,
I'd get in the elevator,

405
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:06,110
I'd be thankful it didn't plummet to
the basement. Uh, I, uh, it, you know,

406
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,580
I get it,

407
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:13,150
press the elevator button and I'd be
thankful the doors opened and I got to my

408
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:16,940
floor. So it was like hundreds
of little tiny things a day.

409
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:21,320
And it was a weird way to live, very
time consuming, but it was also,

410
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:24,530
there was something wonderful about
it because it made you realize very

411
00:25:24,531 --> 00:25:25,364
concretely,

412
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:29,300
there are hundreds of things that go
right every day that you totally take for

413
00:25:29,301 --> 00:25:30,080
granted.

414
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,700
And at least I used to focus on the three
or four that went wrong and just stew

415
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:35,510
on them.

416
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:40,310
So I've tried to keep that radical shift
in perspective of being thankful for

417
00:25:40,311 --> 00:25:44,640
all the tiny little things that go
right. And it has made me happier. It,

418
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:48,990
it's definitely had an impact.
So I want each of you,

419
00:25:48,991 --> 00:25:51,740
if you wouldn't mind,
describe for people, uh,

420
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:56,240
one of my favorite stories in the book,
uh, stoning adulterers. Well, yes,

421
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:59,150
I was doing a lot with the Old Testament,
the Hebrew scriptures,

422
00:25:59,151 --> 00:26:03,590
and it says over and over again you
have to stone adulterers. So I thought,

423
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:08,840
all right, let me try to get this, check
this off the list. So I was, uh, uh,

424
00:26:08,841 --> 00:26:12,540
one day I was in central park and
I was wearing my whole, I had my,

425
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,390
I had to get up the sandals and
a man came up to me and he said,

426
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,570
why are you dressed like
that? And I said, well,

427
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:24,260
I'm trying to follow all the rules of
the Bible from the 10 commandments to

428
00:26:24,261 --> 00:26:27,980
stoning adulterers. And he
said, well, I'm an adulterer.

429
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:31,730
I ain't going to stone me. And I
said, well, that would be fantastic.

430
00:26:31,731 --> 00:26:35,960
Thank you for the offer.
So kind. So I took a, uh,

431
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:41,360
a handful of stones out of my robe pocket
because I had been carrying around for

432
00:26:41,361 --> 00:26:44,100
weeks. Hoecakes because
there was no specification

433
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,450
in terms of the size of the,

434
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:49,450
exactly. That was the key. I showed
it to him and I'm like, you know,

435
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:51,250
there's small stones and you know,

436
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:54,940
I can check it off the list
even if they're small stones.

437
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:57,520
And he was very aggressive adulterer.

438
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:00,940
He grabbed the stones out out of
my hand and threw them at my face.

439
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:04,300
So I thought an eye for an eye,

440
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:08,020
I can chuck one back at him.
So that's how I chucked it off.

441
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:11,350
I checked it off the list and yeah,
I didn't continue that.

442
00:27:11,351 --> 00:27:12,860
There were quite a few.
Uh,

443
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:17,590
I did not continue including if you
follow Leviticus really strictly,

444
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:22,840
you can't touch a woman when she's
menstruating cause she's impure.

445
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,440
But if you take it really literally
a woman, if she's meant joining,

446
00:27:27,441 --> 00:27:31,760
if she sits on something, a
chair, that chair becomes impure.

447
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:37,150
And my wife found that offensive so she
sat in every chair in our apartment and

448
00:27:37,611 --> 00:27:41,750
I had to stand for most of the year. Which
as you know, is probably good for you.

449
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:45,020
Good for your health. Well
you had a travel stool, right?

450
00:27:45,021 --> 00:27:49,610
It was one of those exact sporting
event. Yeah, those are great. Yeah,

451
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,320
they were, um, you know,

452
00:27:51,321 --> 00:27:56,321
they're usually used by people
who are either 83 or 600 pounds,

453
00:27:56,961 --> 00:27:58,250
but I found it very useful,

454
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,190
suited a number of folks.

455
00:28:00,191 --> 00:28:05,191
And then we're not going to get too deep
into the audience questions right now,

456
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:11,490
but we quite a few questions about
your wife and how you manage your

457
00:28:13,181 --> 00:28:17,800
relationship with your wife,
given all of these odd experiments.

458
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:21,700
And do you, did you,

459
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:26,170
did you in some indirect or subconscious
way select someone who have a high

460
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:29,830
tolerance for all of this?
Great question. How do you,

461
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:32,680
how do you repair damage
when damage is done?

462
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:38,160
It is, it is interesting. I mean there
are, first of all, she has veto power.

463
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:41,460
So there are like,
I'm sure you get this all the time,

464
00:28:41,461 --> 00:28:45,970
readers suggesting
ideas. One suggested, uh,

465
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:50,280
become the greatest lover in the world
and do all the positions in the Kama

466
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:54,240
Sutra, which you kind of did in the
four hour body. Uh, but you know,

467
00:28:54,241 --> 00:28:58,620
I've been married for 12 years, so
that was not going to happen. Um,

468
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:01,890
I did pitch it to her and she,
and she's like, no, that is,

469
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,700
and I have to say I was a
little relieved because I,

470
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:09,480
I don't think I can bend my
back like that anymore. Uh,

471
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:14,460
so, so she has veto power.
That's rule number one. Um,

472
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:17,430
and to I think she does get,

473
00:29:17,431 --> 00:29:22,431
she gets a lot of reader feedback
about how she's so patient that helps.

474
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:25,920
So please keep sending those
in positive reinforcement. Um,

475
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:30,480
I will say probably the worst
one for our marriage was,

476
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:36,070
uh, you know, the, the lifelogging
movement where you, you,

477
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:39,760
you take keep track. It's like,
yeah, and record everything.

478
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:44,410
It's like the self tracking, quantified
self taken to the extreme. So you,

479
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,191
I wore,

480
00:29:45,191 --> 00:29:50,191
I had a little tiny camera like smaller
than a Gopro on my ear and I recorded

481
00:29:50,201 --> 00:29:55,090
every moment of my life for about
three months. And it was fascinating.

482
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,790
It really, you know, and I think
it's a glimpse of the future.

483
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:01,570
I think we are all going towards
that for better or worse.

484
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:03,970
But one of the things was I was like,
you know,

485
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:08,680
70% of my arguments with my
wife are about where she says,

486
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:11,920
you didn't tell me that. And I'm like,
yeah, I did. I did tell you that.

487
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,690
So now I'm like,
you know what?

488
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:18,840
Now we can rewind and we can
see what we actually said.

489
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:23,620
So we had a huge argument about something,
whether I had,

490
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:28,810
she had asked me to order Mexican food,
something ridiculously small and trivial,

491
00:30:28,811 --> 00:30:33,280
but it blew up and I was able to, I
was like, the next day I'm like, okay,

492
00:30:33,281 --> 00:30:36,940
let's rewind and watch the argument.
Um,

493
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:41,470
and it was so terrible for our
marriage because it's like,

494
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:46,210
I can't remember.
I think I might've been 60% right,

495
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:51,211
but the net was that I was 0%
right because she was so upset.

496
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:55,840
And you don't want to show
someone yelling or angry.

497
00:30:55,841 --> 00:31:00,370
It just is not,
I don't recommend that as a,

498
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:05,290
a way to navigate a marriage. In fact,
there was a black, you ever go see black?

499
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:10,540
There's a great episode, I think it
was in the first or second season,

500
00:31:10,541 --> 00:31:13,810
the UK edition of Black
Mirror tastic episode.

501
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:16,660
It was the same exact premise,
very similar premise,

502
00:31:16,661 --> 00:31:21,010
but you record through your eye.
It was great. I loved that show.

503
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:23,950
And that was an in the episode,
you know,

504
00:31:23,951 --> 00:31:27,190
things go horribly awry with his marriage,

505
00:31:27,191 --> 00:31:30,200
I think is probably also likely to happen.
Exactly.

506
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:32,360
It becomes ubiquitous technology.

507
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:37,860
What did you learn from that experience
aside from not to replay the Mexican

508
00:31:38,201 --> 00:31:41,530
takeout debate?
I think,

509
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:44,560
well one thing I learned is to,
um,

510
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:50,110
I of course I have hundreds
of hours of material,

511
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:54,910
so, uh, I'll, I'll never be able
to watch it because, you know,

512
00:31:54,911 --> 00:31:56,920
it's just an infinite loop.

513
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:01,960
But I think one is to enjoy
the small moments. You, you
know, if you do watch it,

514
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:06,550
he just realized that 90% of your day,
as you know,

515
00:32:06,551 --> 00:32:09,640
when I'm getting my kids ready for school,

516
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:14,560
if you are annoyed during those half
hour because it's a pain in the ass,

517
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:18,070
that's a half hour of your way,
a life wasted.

518
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:22,810
Like you have to realize this is it.
Like this is what most of life is.

519
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:26,150
So try to enjoy that as well as the,

520
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:29,170
when you know you're playing
laser tag or whatever,

521
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,870
cause that's very rich serving
kill Martinis at your launch party.

522
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,350
That never happened. Uh, so that was one,

523
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:41,240
I mean also the implications for
the future of fascinating, you know,

524
00:32:41,241 --> 00:32:42,590
how's it gonna Affect Crime?
Like,

525
00:32:42,591 --> 00:32:47,591
how will anyone mug someone when it's
all being uploaded immediately to the

526
00:32:47,961 --> 00:32:51,410
cloud? So it will, I think help crime,

527
00:32:51,411 --> 00:32:55,880
but it'll be terrible for
marriages. And you know, I,

528
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:59,600
I feel for a future adulterers,

529
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,890
my heart goes out to them because I can't
imagine how you're going to get away

530
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:08,540
with sneaking around when
everything is fully recorded. Uh,

531
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:09,191
well,

532
00:33:09,191 --> 00:33:14,191
I mean it will also on the flip side
and it will clarify a lot of crimes that

533
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,830
are not committed where people
are wrongly accused. Well,

534
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:20,460
you have the flip side also

535
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:25,270
true. Yeah. It'll be, um,
and I think it'll also,

536
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:30,330
it might make us more tolerant of people's
mistakes because we all do something,

537
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:35,900
you know, every, the youtube
video of people melting down and,

538
00:33:35,901 --> 00:33:39,520
and acting like idiots. Everyone
will have one of those. Yeah.

539
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,850
So we're all going to
have no one's purple.

540
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:45,620
We're all going to have our
flaws right out there on display.

541
00:33:45,621 --> 00:33:49,640
So we have to accept
those and ourselves and,

542
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:52,580
and be a little more tolerant of others.
So it'll be,

543
00:33:52,581 --> 00:33:56,420
it's going to be a weird future, I
really believe. Fascinating but weird.

544
00:33:56,590 --> 00:34:01,360
Yeah, it's a, I mean, the question for me
is who in all these cases, you know who,

545
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:06,930
who are going to be the dominant owners
of this information and controllers of

546
00:34:07,751 --> 00:34:11,930
the bits and bites right there
represent all of these videos. Yeah. Uh,

547
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:16,950
but I want to come back
to tolerance and I'm not,

548
00:34:16,951 --> 00:34:18,780
I'm not sure this is a perfect segue,

549
00:34:18,781 --> 00:34:23,450
but I'm going to force it a radical
honesty. So you wrote a piece,

550
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:28,040
believe it was titled,
I think you're fat. Uh,

551
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:32,520
that is about radical honesty.
Could you describe for people,

552
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:36,570
and then I want to come back and I'm
going to ask you about your thoughts on

553
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:41,460
marriage and parenting, but I
want to talk this, this ties in,

554
00:34:41,461 --> 00:34:45,480
I think on some level, so radical on
safety. Could you describe absolutely the,

555
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:49,470
the origins of this experiment and what
you did and, and where you ended up,

556
00:34:49,471 --> 00:34:50,970
which I don't think we've really talked

557
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,890
no. Well, and to be
radically honest, thank you.

558
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:58,891
You tweeted about it a few
weeks ago and as per usual,

559
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:02,230
like your endorsement class,
mentor readers,

560
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:05,830
one tweet. Then I get like, you know,

561
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:09,730
from months trying to publish they space.

562
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:11,120
I love the piece smiling.

563
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:15,630
Thank you. Uh, yeah. This
piece came about because I was,

564
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,840
I read about this guy in Virginia,

565
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:22,920
a psychologist named Brad Blanton.
Fantastic character,

566
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:24,510
one of the greatest interviews in my life.

567
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:29,640
And he believes that you should never
lie, but he goes further. He says,

568
00:35:29,641 --> 00:35:32,100
whatever's on your brain
should come out of your mouth.

569
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:36,600
No filter like Jim Carrey and liar liar.
So it is insane.

570
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,410
And I was like, well, let me
try this and see what happens.

571
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:45,170
How maybe he's right. Maybe it
will make my life better. Uh,

572
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,130
despite the challenges.
So I did it and all my God,

573
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:54,030
it was the worst month
of my life in many ways.

574
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:58,500
In some ways it was wonderful,
liberating, terrific. In other ways,

575
00:35:58,501 --> 00:36:02,070
it was just dreadful. And to give you
one of the dreadful ones, there was like,

576
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:06,570
we would go to a restaurant
and we would see my wife,

577
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:11,140
friends of my wife's that she hadn't
seen since, since college and they'd be,

578
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:15,540
they said, oh, we should all get together
and have a play date with our kids.

579
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:18,120
And I had to say what was on my brain,
which was,

580
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:22,890
you guys seem nice but I have no
interest in ever seen you again.

581
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,130
Cause I don't have time
to see my own friend.

582
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:29,520
And they were just looked at me aghast.

583
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:32,520
And my wife of course was furious.

584
00:36:32,521 --> 00:36:36,090
And I mean the one thing is
we never did see them again.

585
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:41,210
So in that way it was the fact that
I felt terrible and I still feel,

586
00:36:41,371 --> 00:36:46,140
you know, it was totally terrible
thing to say. So there was that. Um,

587
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:51,480
uh,
but it did affect me in that I still,

588
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:56,130
I'm not radically honest, like, cause
he's crazy. He's like also, you know,

589
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:59,040
if you see a beautiful woman
on the street, you say, hello,

590
00:36:59,041 --> 00:37:01,760
I'm very attracted to you. I
would like to sleep with you. Uh,

591
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:05,730
which I got weirdly a lot
of people and you know,

592
00:37:05,731 --> 00:37:10,670
20 something guys saying they were
using that as a through masterful pickup

593
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:15,240
line. Exactly. And they said, you
know, the rejection rate was like 95%,

594
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:20,640
but if you're okay with that, then 5% of
the women were like, hmm. Interesting.

595
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:22,110
Just in preposition,

596
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,460
I was like the confidence
slash Asperger's.

597
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:31,350
But uh,
so what I have kept from that is I,

598
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:35,930
I tried to do what I call a
radical sustainable honesty or,

599
00:37:35,931 --> 00:37:40,920
or positive radical honesty because I
don't need to tell people, you know, uh,

600
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:45,030
I'm staring at your mole. Like that
just doesn't help the world I think.

601
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:50,190
But for instance, one of the things
I did was when I was doing that,

602
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:53,940
I would be thinking,
you know what,

603
00:37:53,941 --> 00:37:58,941
I really liked that boss of mine
when I was 22 at the small newspaper.

604
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:02,730
He had a very nice influence on me.
Let me call him up and thank him.

605
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,380
So I would call them out of the blue.

606
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:08,220
And it was very awkward because men are
not supposed to express emotions like

607
00:38:08,221 --> 00:38:08,900
that.

608
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:13,890
But I would tell him how much he meant
to me and it made me feel so much better

609
00:38:13,891 --> 00:38:16,410
and I hope,
I think it made him feel better.

610
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:20,700
And so I feel that that's
something I've tried to keep.

611
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:25,230
If I have a positive thought,
then even if it's embarrassing or weird,

612
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:30,150
then I will, I will say like, I love
you man. That kind of thing. Uh,

613
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:32,460
and I think that has made my life better.

614
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:36,040
So I was given a similar assignment

615
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:40,270
by an ex girlfriend a number of years ago.

616
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:41,590
I was having trouble,

617
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:45,970
and this is no secret to people who've
read certainly a few of the chapters in

618
00:38:45,971 --> 00:38:50,260
tools of titans or in other places that
I've had had my ups and downs in my

619
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:53,080
managing of depressive periods
and whatnot. And she said, well,

620
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:54,850
if you're having trouble
making yourself happy,

621
00:38:54,851 --> 00:38:57,820
maybe you should identify
one person every day.

622
00:38:57,821 --> 00:39:01,900
You can send a short thank you
to or call to give a thank you.

623
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:06,930
And specifically people from long ago
or people you used to be close to or who

624
00:39:07,961 --> 00:39:10,060
had a huge influence on you
that you are no longer close to.

625
00:39:10,061 --> 00:39:14,710
And so I started doing this and calling
teachers I had in high school or

626
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:19,030
childhood friends and it was a,
it had a hugely uplifting impact on me.

627
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:23,860
I did it ever go wrong? Did ever
thumb, no, it never went wrong.

628
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:28,100
And sometimes it wasn't even
about speaking in person.
So if I got a voicemail,

629
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:32,970
just leave a heartfelt voicemail. It
never went sideways for me. Uh, and uh,

630
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:37,330
in fact it re re invigorated
I guess are resurrected.

631
00:39:37,331 --> 00:39:41,800
A few childhood friendships and now I'm
back in close contact with a number of

632
00:39:41,801 --> 00:39:46,801
these guys I went to grade school with
and used to play with on a daily basis on

633
00:39:48,521 --> 00:39:50,170
BMX bikes or whenever the hell throwing,

634
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,870
throwing dirt clods into each other's
eyes in the middle of the forest or

635
00:39:52,871 --> 00:39:55,780
whatever we were doing at the time.
So it's been great. It's been really,

636
00:39:55,781 --> 00:39:59,650
really great. I love that.
Uh, how do you, if, if you're,

637
00:39:59,651 --> 00:40:04,420
if you've dismissed the option
of being able to say to someone,

638
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,950
you seem very lovely, but I don't want to
ever see you again, which in a sense is,

639
00:40:08,951 --> 00:40:11,980
is fantastic because you're
able to cut down on all of this.

640
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,770
There's all these social
expectations and commitments.

641
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,250
I think a lot of people are just
drowning and coffee, invitations,

642
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,330
cocktail invitations. Let's do
this. Let's do that. If you're,

643
00:40:22,331 --> 00:40:26,260
if you're trying to practice this
more, a moderate honesty, uh,

644
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:31,570
how do you think of handling in a
place like New York City in particular,

645
00:40:31,571 --> 00:40:35,770
where you have endless options?
I need your advice on that. I am,

646
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:40,060
I am terrible at it. I mean, I will tell
people the truth, which is right now,

647
00:40:40,061 --> 00:40:45,061
I am so overwhelmed that I don't have
time for basic hygiene and that they

648
00:40:45,791 --> 00:40:50,770
wouldn't want to hang out with me anyway
because I smell and I've got yellow

649
00:40:50,771 --> 00:40:55,630
teeth. So that the, and that
is the truth. So maybe that's,

650
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:59,410
that's my best answer. But
yeah, it's a tough one.

651
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:00,790
The Best I've been able to figure out.

652
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:03,010
This was actually
something I borrowed from,

653
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:05,410
I'm not going to mention him by name
because I don't know if you'd want this to

654
00:41:05,411 --> 00:41:09,130
be public,
but a very well known a tech investor,

655
00:41:09,131 --> 00:41:13,120
billionaire tech investor in
Silicon Valley who's always
been very generous with

656
00:41:13,121 --> 00:41:13,900
his time.

657
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:18,310
And we'd met up a number of times and
I asked him if he'd be open to grabbing

658
00:41:18,311 --> 00:41:21,970
dinner. No, I wasn't vague about it
because I think at this point in my life,

659
00:41:21,971 --> 00:41:26,971
I've learned like let's hang out isn't
good enough for someone who has that so

660
00:41:27,131 --> 00:41:28,690
many demands on their time.
So it was like,

661
00:41:28,691 --> 00:41:32,200
I'd love to meet up to chat about this,
this, and this only if you have time.

662
00:41:32,201 --> 00:41:36,290
But we'd had dinner a number of times in
the past and he said, I would love to,

663
00:41:36,291 --> 00:41:39,430
but I'm on, uh, uh, I'm
taking a meeting vacation.

664
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:42,270
And so I started applying this
to everything. I was like, oh,

665
00:41:42,271 --> 00:41:45,630
that's brilliant because it's not
personalized. It's not, I can't do it.

666
00:41:45,631 --> 00:41:49,350
Tim Ferris, because I don't like you. It's
no, I'm not doing any meetings. He said,

667
00:41:49,351 --> 00:41:52,680
I'm not doing any meetings.
I'm actually doing no phone calls.

668
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:56,850
I'm just responding to things via email
because that's the only way I can manage

669
00:41:56,851 --> 00:41:57,750
my schedule right now.

670
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:03,050
And it was so generalized that
I felt totally fine with that.

671
00:42:03,111 --> 00:42:05,210
So I started applying that to
anything I didn't want to do.

672
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,670
I'm taking a conference called vacation,
I'm taking the meeting vacation,

673
00:42:07,671 --> 00:42:12,080
I'm taking a fill in the blank vacation
and also began putting that in my

674
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:15,790
autoresponders so that
I didn't feel obligated.

675
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:20,180
A couple of those you've most certainly,
everyone gets a lot from me.

676
00:42:20,181 --> 00:42:24,770
I love that. Uh, angry when you're taking
a vacation. Everyone needs a vacation,

677
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:27,680
a vacation. Well, and it
is interesting. I, um,

678
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:33,100
uh, yeah, another thing
that I do is a, and,

679
00:42:33,101 --> 00:42:36,970
and some people don't improve
this. You may not, but okay.

680
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:41,830
If I'm totally swamped and someone
asks me out to lunch, then I say,

681
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:42,340
uh,

682
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:47,340
what would you think about a Skype lunch
where we both order in food and we have

683
00:42:47,441 --> 00:42:50,680
lunch and we get to talk to each other.
We get to see each other,

684
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:53,890
but we don't have to Schlep,
we don't have to like waste time.

685
00:42:53,891 --> 00:42:57,370
We don't have to get, you know,
ask the waiter like for the,

686
00:42:57,430 --> 00:42:59,920
for the check and you know,

687
00:42:59,921 --> 00:43:02,800
I'd say 30% of people are offended,

688
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:07,360
but 70% are willing to try.
And I found it very useful.

689
00:43:07,361 --> 00:43:11,560
Skype loads, type lunch, dinner,
Skype, breakfast, whatever you want.

690
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:16,450
And I did it once with this guy who was
tech savvy and he like had a background

691
00:43:16,451 --> 00:43:20,980
of us in a cafe like in Paris.
So it was very nice.

692
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:28,370
A CID or on a lady in the trip moment
virtually. That's fair. That sounds very,

693
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:32,690
I don't know whether I was lady or
the tramp or both. You can be both.

694
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:38,120
She's, there were a couple of bullets
we in preparation for this because I've,

695
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:41,700
I've, so I'm very familiar with
a lot of your work. I've read,

696
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:46,280
I think all of your books up to
this point and just, yeah, it's,

697
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:51,040
so you set a number of
bullets that I, I didn't, uh,

698
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:54,960
expect or I wasn't familiar with.
So I wanted to talk about a few. I,

699
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:59,620
and I feel like some of these, uh,
we have maybe touched on briefly,

700
00:43:59,621 --> 00:44:03,280
but I wanted to revisit being
kind to your older self.

701
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:06,450
Can you explain what this means?
This was,

702
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:07,331
uh,

703
00:44:07,331 --> 00:44:12,290
I learned this while doing the
health book and the idea was,

704
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:16,950
um, I think it was, it
was a Yale professor. Uh,

705
00:44:16,951 --> 00:44:20,930
I forget his name, but ego nomics
I think is the, what he called it.

706
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:26,530
And the idea was when they do experiments
and they remind people of that,

707
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,590
that they are going to
be around in 20 years,

708
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:32,460
people make more responsible decisions.

709
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:37,380
Like financially they invest more in
their four zero oneK and also health wise

710
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:41,550
they act more responsibly.
So I thought this was fascinating.

711
00:44:41,551 --> 00:44:46,110
So I took it and I took a,
uh, just a selfie of an,

712
00:44:46,111 --> 00:44:50,340
I digitally aged it on one of those apps.
And so I now look,

713
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:53,100
I've got this weird,
I looked like I have a skin disease,

714
00:44:53,101 --> 00:44:56,400
but it's me at like 82.

715
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:59,460
And I put printed it out
and put it over my desk.

716
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:04,560
And that older age a is always
looking down and saying, you know,

717
00:45:04,561 --> 00:45:07,020
treat me well treatment,
remember,

718
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:10,200
treat me like you would
treat a friend and you know,

719
00:45:10,201 --> 00:45:14,390
just don't eat that fourth oatmeal cookie,
you know,

720
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:18,660
just get on that treadmill.
So I find that,

721
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:21,750
I find that very inspiring and motivating.

722
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:27,310
And does it something that you're able
to continually notice or do you tune it

723
00:45:27,311 --> 00:45:30,700
out after a while? This is a challenge
that I've had with certain reminders.

724
00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:33,260
So I have a quote for instance from,
uh,

725
00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:38,770
Marcus really is on my refrigerator in
San Francisco and it's about not being,

726
00:45:41,290 --> 00:45:44,050
trying to regain the harmony as quickly
as possible, et Cetera, et cetera.

727
00:45:44,051 --> 00:45:47,230
It's one of these very Marcus
Aurelius type quotes. Uh, there,

728
00:45:47,231 --> 00:45:48,850
there are a number of
them around my house,

729
00:45:48,851 --> 00:45:53,851
but I will occasionally schedule rotating
of the quote or even location because

730
00:45:54,941 --> 00:45:58,870
otherwise it just becomes part of
the scenery and I don't notice it. So

731
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:02,630
that, and I was, I have
the exact same thing.

732
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:05,780
Like if you leave it in the same
place you're going to forget about.

733
00:46:05,781 --> 00:46:10,781
What I do is I make it part of
my rotating screen saver so that,

734
00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:15,230
okay, this makes sense. So that
it pops up every, you know,

735
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:19,040
couple of days and then, oh yeah,
I should, but you're totally right.

736
00:46:19,041 --> 00:46:22,970
We are so good at tuning
things out that have been there

737
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
necessarily. Right. But I mean, it's
evolutionarily, it's like, all right,

738
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:27,080
if there's a piece of furniture,

739
00:46:27,081 --> 00:46:31,370
I don't need to have some type of
acute fighter flight intensity level

740
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:32,780
observation of it.
Right.

741
00:46:32,781 --> 00:46:36,950
Because it's clearly not having a
direct impact of my survival. Uh,

742
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:41,710
and, and I had that same
experience with photos.

743
00:46:41,711 --> 00:46:44,350
I had a screensaver that
was a photo of my family,

744
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:46,960
totally tuned it out after three days.

745
00:46:47,290 --> 00:46:50,830
So I started rotating photos
to remind myself. Oh yeah,

746
00:46:50,831 --> 00:46:55,060
we did do a fun thing there.
And you know, it's not all, uh,

747
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:59,740
tantrums, tantrums and debates
over Mexican food. Exactly.

748
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:04,420
What, uh, what else have you continued
to do from drop dead healthy?

749
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:09,190
I still do love, uh, treadmill desks.

750
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,830
I made my own,
I didn't buy the fancy one,

751
00:47:11,831 --> 00:47:16,450
but I do find it
energizing, you know, and I,

752
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:17,980
I only walked like one and a half,

753
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:23,250
two miles per hour when I'm writing
a or answering emails. But, uh,

754
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:27,250
I find it if I'm sitting
in front of a computer,

755
00:47:27,251 --> 00:47:31,630
I am tempted to just like rest my
head on the space bar and fall asleep.

756
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:37,150
So I you can't do that when you're
on a treadmill. So I do like that.

757
00:47:37,151 --> 00:47:41,020
And I also still like, uh, the,

758
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,680
the competition.
Some people are not motivated by this,

759
00:47:44,681 --> 00:47:48,970
but I am like getting friends,
uh,

760
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:54,690
making sure that I get to 10,000
steps or my friends can mock me,

761
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:58,370
that they can see there's like a
leaderboard and that they can, would,

762
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:01,810
would you use for that right now
in terms of sharing that with them?

763
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,120
I have been a use,

764
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:08,100
I like hooked up my
fitbit to my apple health.

765
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:11,290
It was complicated. It
took, it took a while. Yeah.

766
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:15,960
And how do you encourage your friends
to mock you if you don't get 10,000?

767
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:18,550
Are they the type of friends who don't
need much instruction in the market

768
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:22,940
apartment? Yeah, I'm trying to think. I
used to, it's been awhile, but, um, the,

769
00:48:22,941 --> 00:48:26,650
this great writer who
wrote the, uh, the seek,

770
00:48:26,690 --> 00:48:31,330
the Henrietta lacks book. Uh Oh,
right, sure, sure, sure. Anyway,

771
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:34,190
she is,
she is great and also very,

772
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,880
so I think he just got to
find the people who, uh,

773
00:48:37,990 --> 00:48:42,760
are most adept at mockery. I
am motivated by mockery. Uh,

774
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,020
some people are not.

775
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:46,020
So there's a,

776
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:49,080
there's a story that I've told quite
a bit because I think that it's very

777
00:48:49,081 --> 00:48:53,850
practical in a lot of ways and
that there are variations of this.

778
00:48:53,851 --> 00:48:58,680
But I'd like you to tell probably the
more accurate version because I feel like

779
00:48:58,681 --> 00:49:02,880
I get details of this wrong when I
retell it. Blackmailing yourself. Yeah.

780
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:05,060
Sly with cell on it.
I went to,

781
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:09,510
let's talk about the cake that's
talking about the gay, Gay, Gay, uh,

782
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:13,600
which I do not support just to get
that out there right up front. Uh,

783
00:49:13,890 --> 00:49:14,641
but I launched,

784
00:49:14,641 --> 00:49:18,540
I've watched many of your talks and and
in a couple of them you mentioned that

785
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:20,640
very flattering. Thank you. Uh,

786
00:49:20,670 --> 00:49:24,180
this is an idea by that
same Yale professor and the,

787
00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:28,410
his idea was if you want to quit something
or you want to stop doing a terrible

788
00:49:28,411 --> 00:49:31,830
behavior,
then you can blackmail yourself.

789
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:36,730
Is this the same Yale professor ended up
leader or currently being involved with

790
00:49:36,731 --> 00:49:41,480
stick.com? Yes, that's
right. S T I C K k.com.

791
00:49:41,481 --> 00:49:45,520
Where this is built into sort of the
mechanics of how the site works. Exactly.

792
00:49:45,590 --> 00:49:49,600
Okay. This is where you choose the
anti charity. It's the anti charity.

793
00:49:49,601 --> 00:49:54,370
It's sort of motivated. You took
it to the next level. Well I was,

794
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:56,040
excuse me,

795
00:49:56,040 --> 00:50:01,040
I was and I'm doing the health book and
I was eating all of these dried mangoes

796
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:05,430
cause they sort of have the
veneer of health cause they're,

797
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:10,200
they're fruit but, but really they're
just sugar. I just so much sugar.

798
00:50:10,201 --> 00:50:14,690
So I knew I had to quit. So I
arranged it. I said to my wife,

799
00:50:15,090 --> 00:50:19,710
if I eat another dried mango,
then I'm instructing you.

800
00:50:19,711 --> 00:50:21,120
Now you have to do this,

801
00:50:21,121 --> 00:50:25,260
you have to send a $100 check to the KKK.

802
00:50:26,070 --> 00:50:28,640
And I,
it was so effective.

803
00:50:28,641 --> 00:50:33,641
It was crazy because just the thought of
that check going out made me physically

804
00:50:34,171 --> 00:50:37,860
ill and I was able to quit cold Turkey.
So,

805
00:50:38,570 --> 00:50:41,840
and he talks about people
smoking use this, uh,

806
00:50:42,350 --> 00:50:45,440
strategy and yeah.
Have you ever tried it?

807
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:49,830
I have tried the anti
charity and it's incredible.

808
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:53,700
I've also done this with bedding
because I think that for instance,

809
00:50:53,701 --> 00:50:56,250
if you have a betting pool with
five people who have a certain goal,

810
00:50:56,280 --> 00:51:00,300
let's just say that's body re composition.
So they're each getting,

811
00:51:00,330 --> 00:51:03,660
this is actually a real example from a
friend of mine who recently lost 40 or 50

812
00:51:03,661 --> 00:51:07,980
pounds. They're each getting
dexa scans. So these scans,

813
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:12,030
it'll indicate body fat percentage
and muscle mass. And so on, every,

814
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:14,880
let's just call it two weeks
or something like that,

815
00:51:14,881 --> 00:51:19,620
which is actually surprisingly
inexpensive. It's a big
30, 40 bucks. Hmm. And uh,

816
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:24,290
whoever has the most successful
recomposition of their
body by the end would get

817
00:51:24,350 --> 00:51:28,730
the pot and each person, I think it was
putting in $100 and so it was $500 total,

818
00:51:28,731 --> 00:51:30,140
but people will,

819
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:35,000
I don't think it's the $500 that gets
people to lose the weight in this case

820
00:51:35,001 --> 00:51:37,700
lose fat.
I think that it is the two things,

821
00:51:37,701 --> 00:51:42,701
the the social mockery and a at grab
asking and ball busting in this case is

822
00:51:43,521 --> 00:51:47,690
five guys and it is the losing of $100.

823
00:51:47,691 --> 00:51:51,170
It's the loss aversion I think
more than the prospect of gain.

824
00:51:51,171 --> 00:51:56,171
And so this is one of the many
issues that I suppose I take with the

825
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:02,930
43rd place gets a gold star ever.
Everyone's a winner.

826
00:52:02,931 --> 00:52:05,240
We should only focus on
positive reinforcement,

827
00:52:05,630 --> 00:52:09,890
a sort of fetishizing of the patting
on the head in the u s at least where I

828
00:52:09,891 --> 00:52:10,724
think the,

829
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:15,800
the s the stick instead of the carrot and
the like the shame and humiliation and

830
00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:18,780
all of these, all of these
things that are thought of as,

831
00:52:18,781 --> 00:52:23,210
as negative actually really,
really useful tools if you recognize how,

832
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:24,583
uh,

833
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:28,970
how ingrained they are as
incentives in human beings.

834
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:31,430
I find that very useful.
I mean,

835
00:52:31,431 --> 00:52:35,210
you've got to be careful not to crush
someone's ego so they curl up in a fetal

836
00:52:35,211 --> 00:52:39,830
position. So it's a fine line.
But, uh, but good natured,

837
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:44,870
uh, sticks, I think, you know,
like a soft maybe, uh, you know,

838
00:52:44,871 --> 00:52:49,280
nerf sticks I think are,
are incredibly helpful. Uh,

839
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:55,310
so this is one that I may have read
about. It didn't ring a bell. Uh,

840
00:52:55,960 --> 00:53:00,630
the, uh, trip to Jerry
Falwell's church. Oh yeah. Yes.

841
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:06,170
This is when I was writing the Bible and
I sent you this in the context of just

842
00:53:07,441 --> 00:53:09,600
the joy of being a mentor.
Uh,

843
00:53:10,590 --> 00:53:14,190
and I can say that because this guy,
my mentee,

844
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:17,460
my protege has far
surpassed me in success.

845
00:53:17,910 --> 00:53:22,380
His name is Kevin Reus and he was a
writer for the New York Times in New York

846
00:53:22,381 --> 00:53:26,940
magazine. Now he's at fusion and he's
written a couple great books, but he,

847
00:53:27,150 --> 00:53:29,970
I met him because I was
writing my book on the Bible.

848
00:53:29,971 --> 00:53:33,840
He was a freshman at my
Alma Mater Brown University.

849
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:38,160
And he wrote me a very funny letter
saying he wanted it to be a writer.

850
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:42,210
So immediately that's a good lesson.
Like just the Chutzpah,

851
00:53:42,211 --> 00:53:44,040
I call it a strategic Chutzpah,

852
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:48,330
just writing out of the blue instead
of going through alumni relations,

853
00:53:48,331 --> 00:53:50,460
he just wrote me out of the blue,
I want to be a writer,

854
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:54,380
I'll work for you for free
while I reason for it.

855
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:57,030
So that I was like,
you know,

856
00:53:57,031 --> 00:54:02,031
I was already impressed and at the time
I was trying to follow all the rules of

857
00:54:02,551 --> 00:54:06,150
the Bible and the Bible
actually in the Old Testament,

858
00:54:06,151 --> 00:54:08,700
slavery is,
is fine.

859
00:54:08,970 --> 00:54:13,050
So I was really struggling with how
do I deal with that in my life because

860
00:54:13,230 --> 00:54:17,790
obviously slavery not so
fine, not so legal. Thank God.

861
00:54:18,030 --> 00:54:22,110
Uh, so I said the closest
thing to slavery, uh, in,

862
00:54:22,111 --> 00:54:24,360
in my life isn't an into an internship.

863
00:54:24,390 --> 00:54:27,540
So if you can come and
be my intern and uh,

864
00:54:27,550 --> 00:54:32,280
and let me call you my biblical
slave, then let's do it. So He's like,

865
00:54:32,281 --> 00:54:36,330
I'm in and he was great.
So proactive.

866
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:37,710
And then as a thank you,

867
00:54:37,711 --> 00:54:41,670
I took him on one of the trips I made
for that book where I was going around

868
00:54:41,671 --> 00:54:44,370
trying to see how different people
interpreted the Bible. Literally.

869
00:54:44,670 --> 00:54:48,840
And I took him to Jerry
Falwell's church and he was,

870
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:51,900
he was fascinated. He was
like, this is amazing.

871
00:54:51,901 --> 00:54:56,250
This is like an alternate universe.
I live in a bubble. I want to,

872
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:00,790
what if I transferred from Brown,
the most liberal college, uh,

873
00:55:00,870 --> 00:55:03,900
in the United States to Liberty College,

874
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:07,980
which is one of the most conservative
where you can't watch an r rated movie.

875
00:55:07,981 --> 00:55:09,080
You get in trouble for,

876
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:14,240
you can't like holding hands with
someone of the opposite sex is like,

877
00:55:15,470 --> 00:55:19,920
you know, that's for
voting. So, uh, I was like,

878
00:55:19,921 --> 00:55:22,650
that's an interesting idea.
And I said,

879
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:26,190
encouraged them to write a proposal and
I helped him a bit and hooked him up

880
00:55:26,191 --> 00:55:31,191
with an agent and he did it and
he went and got the book contract,

881
00:55:31,321 --> 00:55:35,760
wrote a great book, which is Great.
Not just because it's interesting,

882
00:55:35,761 --> 00:55:38,150
but because it's very nuanced and he's,

883
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:42,540
he shows that these are people and that
there are benefits to this way of life.

884
00:55:42,541 --> 00:55:46,650
And, uh, so it's not, he
didn't villainize him. Uh,

885
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:48,890
and anyway,
uh,

886
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:52,110
I thought that that was a fantastic,

887
00:55:52,111 --> 00:55:57,111
so just this idea of like
being a mentor gives,

888
00:55:58,290 --> 00:56:03,060
gives so much pleasure. I
think it's, uh, you know,

889
00:56:03,061 --> 00:56:06,210
in one way it's a waste of time,
but in another way it's just,

890
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:10,050
and it's also from a very practical
point of view, it's paid off.

891
00:56:10,051 --> 00:56:13,650
Like now he's so much smarter than me
and more connected with the Internet that

892
00:56:13,651 --> 00:56:18,480
he can help me.
What if we look at,

893
00:56:18,570 --> 00:56:19,403
uh,

894
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:24,160
your toolkit and set rules that you have

895
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:28,260
done a lot of experiments for
many, many different things. If,

896
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:29,770
if you were trying to

897
00:56:32,210 --> 00:56:35,540
give someone who is saying
about to get married,

898
00:56:35,690 --> 00:56:40,690
recommendations for
marriage and parenting,

899
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:46,520
if you, if you had to be as not summer,
but as, as, as serious as possible, what,

900
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:49,370
what, what, what would, what would,
what would the real advice be?

901
00:56:50,090 --> 00:56:54,050
Well, a couple of things come to
mind. One is, you know, the Cliche,

902
00:56:54,051 --> 00:56:57,170
don't go to bed angry.
I fully disagree with that.

903
00:56:57,230 --> 00:57:02,120
I go to bed angry all the time and I
find it so helpful because my wife gets

904
00:57:02,121 --> 00:57:05,060
cranky at night.
If I tried to argue it out with her,

905
00:57:05,061 --> 00:57:09,140
she would be furious and neither of us
would get sleep. It would be a disaster.

906
00:57:09,870 --> 00:57:13,020
He go to sleep, you wake up in the
morning, you have a fresh perspective,

907
00:57:13,021 --> 00:57:16,170
you can talk about it rationally.
And I do that with my kids too.

908
00:57:16,171 --> 00:57:19,710
Like we start to get an argument. I
say, you know what? Let's cool down.

909
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:23,930
Let's think about this.
I'm not forgetting about this argument,

910
00:57:23,990 --> 00:57:27,830
but let's reconvene in in a few hours.

911
00:57:28,410 --> 00:57:32,490
So I actually, I do like that.
So don't go do, go to bed.

912
00:57:32,670 --> 00:57:36,190
Angry is my first,
uh,

913
00:57:36,210 --> 00:57:40,950
another one is from my wife's
a Stepdad who died recently,

914
00:57:40,951 --> 00:57:43,770
but he said when we were getting married,
I thought he gave very good advice.

915
00:57:43,770 --> 00:57:47,510
He said,
you both think Europe,

916
00:57:47,511 --> 00:57:52,511
both gonna think that you're doing like
70% of the work in the marriage and

917
00:57:52,941 --> 00:57:54,080
you're both wrong,
you know,

918
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:59,140
so just be aware of how much the other
person is doing and you're taking for

919
00:57:59,511 --> 00:58:02,940
granted. Uh, and, and for
one of my experiments,

920
00:58:02,941 --> 00:58:05,220
the one I said where I tried
to be the best husband,

921
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:08,170
I was one of the,

922
00:58:08,290 --> 00:58:12,920
one of the things we did was we wrote a
list of everything she does in our lives

923
00:58:12,921 --> 00:58:14,450
around the house and everything I do.

924
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:17,780
I honestly thought it was
going to be about 50, 50,

925
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:22,790
and it was like 80 her and 20 me.
So it was very humbling experience.

926
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:24,690
It was in one sense,

927
00:58:24,691 --> 00:58:28,380
terrible because now she
realizes too how little I did.

928
00:58:28,830 --> 00:58:32,880
So it's made my life worse in one sense,
but it's also,

929
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:37,240
it was very revolutionary and I
got to see, you know, like the,

930
00:58:37,270 --> 00:58:40,040
the little um, liquid soap thing. I,

931
00:58:40,041 --> 00:58:42,970
I just figured they refilled themselves.

932
00:58:42,971 --> 00:58:47,560
It was like a self cleaning oven or
something, but I was like, oh yeah,

933
00:58:47,561 --> 00:58:48,730
someone has to do that.

934
00:58:50,230 --> 00:58:55,120
So be aware of how much the other person
is doing. Even if you, you don't see it,

935
00:58:55,230 --> 00:58:59,540
you know, it's the, it's the conference,
you know, what the whatever biases,

936
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:02,990
you're not seeing it so
you're not aware of it. Well,

937
00:59:03,090 --> 00:59:06,780
can I just pop that back
at you and ask you what,

938
00:59:06,870 --> 00:59:10,050
what you would suggest to someone

939
00:59:10,650 --> 00:59:15,390
going into a relationship? Ah, I think
this is probably above my pay grade.

940
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:23,500
I have not yet decided how I feel about
marriage or gained much clarity related

941
00:59:24,171 --> 00:59:27,460
to, uh, to marriage. But
you know, I think I would,

942
00:59:27,610 --> 00:59:32,380
I would give the advice
that Amanda Palmer,

943
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:37,500
the musician received from a mentor
furs and for any type of conflict

944
00:59:37,571 --> 00:59:41,010
resolution, say less. I think
that would be the starting point.

945
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:45,450
Just say less like that because my
inclination and I think that my entire

946
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:49,800
families are much of my family is this
way. Certainly my brother's this way.

947
00:59:50,190 --> 00:59:55,190
The desire to be right sometimes
overrides the pragmatic

948
00:59:57,450 --> 01:00:01,860
road to being effective,
at least with uh,

949
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:09,080
my brother and I can both get kind of
righteously indignant and that does not

950
01:00:09,390 --> 01:00:13,950
help with conflict resolution. It
turns out. So I would say say less.

951
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:14,900
I've become better at it.

952
01:00:14,970 --> 01:00:18,150
I love, and that there are a
couple of things that come to mind.

953
01:00:18,151 --> 01:00:23,151
Phrases like I've heard you can be right
or you can be married but not both,

954
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:26,370
which I think is a good one.

955
01:00:26,550 --> 01:00:29,610
And then I asked some 80 year old guy
who would have been married for 50 years,

956
01:00:29,611 --> 01:00:33,820
what his secret is and he said,
okay, tooth marks on the tongue.

957
01:00:33,970 --> 01:00:37,210
That's the secret to a happy marriage.
Just bite your tongue,

958
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:38,500
bite it by the bite it.

959
01:00:39,070 --> 01:00:40,190
It's funny,
there's some,

960
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:42,710
there's some funny bits of advice
that I've heard thrown around.

961
01:00:42,711 --> 01:00:46,130
I'm not saying this is the advice I
would give. I also talked to a friend,

962
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:51,440
he's soon to be, who was it?
It was not as father in law.

963
01:00:51,470 --> 01:00:52,840
It was not as direct father in law.
It,

964
01:00:52,841 --> 01:00:55,730
he was about to get married
literally the day of the wedding.

965
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:58,850
And I think it was the
grandfather from the old country,

966
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:02,270
like Poland or somewhere grabbed him
and he's like, let's take a walk.

967
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:05,390
Took him for a walk and he said, this
is all you need to know. He goes,

968
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:08,000
only professionals only on the road.

969
01:01:09,050 --> 01:01:13,340
So I'll let people figure that out
for themselves. But yeah, some,

970
01:01:13,341 --> 01:01:15,550
some credit relationship advice out there.

971
01:01:16,330 --> 01:01:19,990
Other advice I would give would be

972
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:21,971
no.

973
01:01:21,971 --> 01:01:26,110
What you need to work on and ideally find
someone who's really good at what you

974
01:01:26,111 --> 01:01:31,060
need to work on. Um,
because I, I do think,

975
01:01:31,061 --> 01:01:32,740
at least for me,
the,

976
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:38,400
there's a complimentary polarity that
needs to exist for a relationship to have

977
01:01:38,410 --> 01:01:41,500
any longevity. And uh, it's, uh,

978
01:01:41,890 --> 01:01:45,160
it's a complementary set of skills,

979
01:01:45,161 --> 01:01:47,950
but those could overlap
very much with attributes,

980
01:01:48,250 --> 01:01:52,840
just God given or nature
given predispositions.

981
01:01:53,010 --> 01:01:57,610
Uh, and then the, you know, something that
I don't know if I've ever written about,

982
01:01:57,611 --> 01:01:59,710
but I've noticed for a
lot of relationships,

983
01:01:59,711 --> 01:02:04,711
and this goes for Hetero normative or
homosexual goes for anything sexual as far

984
01:02:06,401 --> 01:02:08,440
as I can tell, uh, at least in,

985
01:02:08,441 --> 01:02:13,441
in many cases that if you were to imagine
a sliding scale and you have 100%,

986
01:02:15,911 --> 01:02:19,650
and this, this is going to get people
up in a tizzy, no matter I phrase it.

987
01:02:19,651 --> 01:02:21,810
So I'm going to try to state it simply,
uh,

988
01:02:22,290 --> 01:02:26,550
100% what we would consider feminine
attributes on one end of the scale,

989
01:02:26,551 --> 01:02:29,700
and then 100% masculine attributes
at the other end of the scale.

990
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:34,260
And in the middle you have perfect
Androgyny, just a complete perfect 50,

991
01:02:34,261 --> 01:02:38,010
50 androgyny in all respects,
physical, mental, emotional,

992
01:02:38,011 --> 01:02:43,011
and otherwise that wherever
you are on the slider,

993
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:47,670
you will be most attracted to and
have the most longevity. Well,

994
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:48,900
actually I should not say longevity.

995
01:02:48,901 --> 01:02:53,901
You'll be most attracted to and perhaps
most compatible with someone who is the

996
01:02:54,810 --> 01:02:56,130
opposite.
So if you are,

997
01:02:56,131 --> 01:03:01,110
say 70% male attributes
or a masculine attributes,

998
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:02,760
30% feminine attributes,

999
01:03:02,850 --> 01:03:07,710
then you will be most rejected someone
who is 70% feminine attributes,

1000
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:09,210
30% masculine attributes,

1001
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:14,540
and that that sort of equal polarity from
the center 50 50 proof androgyny seems

1002
01:03:16,201 --> 01:03:20,310
to work pretty well.
And that when you find someone who

1003
01:03:21,870 --> 01:03:22,830
generally,

1004
01:03:22,831 --> 01:03:26,880
and this is just very abstract
speculation on my part,

1005
01:03:26,881 --> 01:03:31,881
but it seems to be the case when you see
if people who are say overlap too much

1006
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:36,180
in on one side of that spectrum,

1007
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:41,470
very rarely works. And from what
I've observed, very, very rarely, uh,

1008
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:43,440
so that,
that's not so much advice,

1009
01:03:43,441 --> 01:03:46,860
but maybe I conceptual framework for
thinking about, yeah, that's interesting.

1010
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:50,220
I was trying to apply it to
my own merits to theater. Uh,

1011
01:03:50,530 --> 01:03:54,280
and if I lined up and I
think actually 70 30 is,

1012
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:57,430
is about where I am. Salmon maybe. Yeah,

1013
01:03:57,510 --> 01:03:59,640
maybe 65 35 and

1014
01:04:01,190 --> 01:04:04,970
I don't know if different people would
say lower. So those are, those are the,

1015
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:09,420
some of my passing thoughts. Um,
Bilin ones working on it. Yeah.

1016
01:04:09,450 --> 01:04:10,770
This is something I'm working on a lot.

1017
01:04:10,771 --> 01:04:15,030
I'm hoping to have a number of people
on the podcast to discuss these types of

1018
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:18,510
questions as the Perella would
be one there a handful of others.

1019
01:04:18,511 --> 01:04:22,620
Have you had Dan savage on the, I haven't,
you know, he would be another, he'd be,

1020
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:27,000
he'd be another mind to pick on this.
And uh, he's been recommended to,

1021
01:04:27,090 --> 01:04:31,500
to quite a few, uh, by quite a
few listeners of mine as well.

1022
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:36,030
Uh, so it's, it's, uh, so I was
chatting with a friend of mine,

1023
01:04:36,210 --> 01:04:39,160
I don't know if you've spent any time
with Neil Strauss before. All right,

1024
01:04:39,190 --> 01:04:42,300
so back, so Neil, eight time New
York Times bestselling author,

1025
01:04:42,301 --> 01:04:45,360
he's one of those guys who never gets
writer's block. It makes me crazy.

1026
01:04:45,390 --> 01:04:48,810
But he wrote a piece recently,

1027
01:04:48,811 --> 01:04:52,950
I think it was for rolling stone and
just like the age of fear. But the point,

1028
01:04:52,951 --> 01:04:56,670
I might be getting the headline wrong,
but it,

1029
01:04:56,700 --> 01:05:01,500
the basic premise was that we've never
lived in safer times and yet everyone is

1030
01:05:01,501 --> 01:05:04,440
more afraid than they've ever more
fearful than they've ever been.

1031
01:05:04,980 --> 01:05:08,970
So for a while you wrote a column for,

1032
01:05:08,971 --> 01:05:11,100
I guess it was mental floss.
Yes.

1033
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:15,510
Can I just say one thing about Neil
Strauss that I love is that he is so

1034
01:05:15,511 --> 01:05:18,160
generous with his ideas.
And this is something

1035
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:21,510
I've come around to
like, uh, you know, he,

1036
01:05:21,870 --> 01:05:25,300
he gave me two or three book ideas.
I never pursued them,

1037
01:05:25,301 --> 01:05:29,230
but they're good book ideas. Like he
had one where he said, you should just,

1038
01:05:30,130 --> 01:05:34,480
you know what, it's kind of similar to
your podcast. You should find the best,

1039
01:05:34,650 --> 01:05:38,700
the Michael Jordan of everything and
learn their secrets and then write a book.

1040
01:05:38,701 --> 01:05:42,180
It's kind of tools for titans kind of
exactly what I did. That's hilarious.

1041
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:43,350
I didn't realize that.

1042
01:05:43,830 --> 01:05:47,610
But I love the idea of being
generous with your ideas.

1043
01:05:47,611 --> 01:05:52,200
Cause when I first started my career, I
was so paranoid. I wouldn't, people say,

1044
01:05:52,201 --> 01:05:55,560
what are you working on? Oh, I can't tell
you. Even though it was like, you know,

1045
01:05:55,561 --> 01:05:58,770
it was probably some lean thing
that no one's going to steal.

1046
01:05:58,771 --> 01:06:02,610
And if they did steal it. So what?
It's all about execution. Uh,

1047
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:07,520
so I, this is a crazy story.
This is, I'm much older than you.

1048
01:06:07,521 --> 01:06:10,550
So when I very first started,
I got out of college,

1049
01:06:10,580 --> 01:06:14,150
they were still libraries and that's
where you would go to research things.

1050
01:06:14,450 --> 01:06:17,540
And I was doing a book on,
it was like a joke book on the eerie,

1051
01:06:17,541 --> 01:06:22,430
similarities between Jesus and Elvis
because Elvis had said that he was,

1052
01:06:22,820 --> 01:06:24,350
he believed he was the second coming.

1053
01:06:24,590 --> 01:06:28,430
And I was so paranoid that I
went to two different libraries.

1054
01:06:28,580 --> 01:06:32,210
So I went to one to get books about
Elvis and wanting to get books.

1055
01:06:32,580 --> 01:06:36,530
Anybody to put two and two together.
Yeah. Is that an insane level of delusion?

1056
01:06:36,531 --> 01:06:38,210
They're like,
who cares?

1057
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:43,480
And then now I feel telling people my
ideas at the positives outweigh the

1058
01:06:44,661 --> 01:06:47,900
negatives that you've,
you meet people who are interesting,

1059
01:06:47,901 --> 01:06:51,300
who can help you or expand the idea.
Um,

1060
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:56,460
I dunno if you know Adam Mansbach,
uh, who wrote go the, I don't know.

1061
01:06:56,480 --> 01:07:00,910
Are you loud? Do you want the e on this
or no? Go the F to sleep. Oh No, you.

1062
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:03,260
Oh yeah, yeah, absolutely. You
don't know. We have lots of cursing,

1063
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:07,310
so deliberately not,
uh, Falwell compliant.

1064
01:07:08,450 --> 01:07:12,740
So yes, go the fuck to sleep. Really.
Yeah. And he really, it's brilliant,

1065
01:07:12,770 --> 01:07:17,600
which became a huge bestseller because
it got leaked as far as I can tell as a

1066
01:07:17,601 --> 01:07:20,630
pdf among people in the publishing
world. Oh, that's so interesting.

1067
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:22,820
Part of how it became a huge bestseller.

1068
01:07:22,850 --> 01:07:27,850
Well that's similar to because he had put
it up as a Facebook update and like as

1069
01:07:28,101 --> 01:07:32,000
a joke, he said, I'm going to write
a book called go after sleep and,

1070
01:07:32,190 --> 01:07:33,780
and people are like,
you should do that.

1071
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:38,280
So the idea of sharing and being out
there with your ideas, um, that's,

1072
01:07:38,281 --> 01:07:39,990
I've been a big change in my career.

1073
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:43,830
So just to touch on that because I
think it's really important ideas. Uh,

1074
01:07:43,970 --> 01:07:47,990
Neil Strauss does this all though,
when he is working on something,

1075
01:07:47,991 --> 01:07:49,790
he is tremendously paranoid about it.

1076
01:07:49,791 --> 01:07:52,700
And when he's already
committed to writing something,

1077
01:07:52,790 --> 01:07:55,370
I've known Neil forever
and he's still will not,

1078
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,270
he's afraid of letting out the meme now.

1079
01:07:58,310 --> 01:07:59,720
But I do think these are
two different things.

1080
01:07:59,721 --> 01:08:04,020
Once you fully committed
to doing something and when
you're testing the waters I

1081
01:08:04,021 --> 01:08:07,720
think are two distinct phases. But I
remember when I was proofreading his book,

1082
01:08:07,721 --> 01:08:09,520
emergency number one,

1083
01:08:09,521 --> 01:08:14,521
the only reason he let me write about
it or rather a read it was because he

1084
01:08:14,621 --> 01:08:17,030
wouldn't tell what he was writing about.
He wouldn't tell me, he wouldn't tell me.

1085
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:21,830
And I just threw out this hail Mary and I
said, what is it? Some five flags stuff,

1086
01:08:21,831 --> 01:08:26,831
which is very sort of insider terminology
for all sorts of kind of prepper

1087
01:08:27,021 --> 01:08:30,740
survivalist,
multiple passport communities.

1088
01:08:30,860 --> 01:08:35,090
And his eyes got about the
size of, of, of, of uh,

1089
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:39,860
of a dinner plate. And he
said, what have you heard,

1090
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:40,753
what have you heard?

1091
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:46,680
And then he would give me printed
out like 15 to 20 pages at a time to

1092
01:08:46,911 --> 01:08:47,421
proofread.

1093
01:08:47,421 --> 01:08:50,630
And then I would have to give those
back before I could have the next set.

1094
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:54,970
I love it. Where are they color
coded? I color coded, although the,

1095
01:08:54,980 --> 01:08:56,100
I'm sure knowing the,
Oh,

1096
01:08:56,101 --> 01:08:59,450
there's probably some type
of identification like serial
numbers on them, but uh,

1097
01:08:59,451 --> 01:09:01,970
but he,
he is very generous as ideas.

1098
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:06,020
Until he decides where he's going
to go all in. And Kevin Rose,

1099
01:09:06,021 --> 01:09:09,560
very close friend of
Mine, serial entrepreneur,
extremely successful investor,

1100
01:09:09,561 --> 01:09:14,510
does the same thing. And the Kevin
Kelly founding editor of wired,

1101
01:09:14,511 --> 01:09:17,900
one of my favorite people out there, I
think he's, he's probably the real world,

1102
01:09:17,930 --> 01:09:20,530
most interesting man in
the world. Uh, you know,

1103
01:09:20,540 --> 01:09:24,740
a technology futurist who spends time
with the Amish almost every year to

1104
01:09:24,741 --> 01:09:29,120
determine how they, how they
accept and vet technology. I mean,

1105
01:09:29,210 --> 01:09:30,110
fascinating guy.

1106
01:09:30,380 --> 01:09:35,380
He also tries to give away or kill as
many of his own ideas as possible and if

1107
01:09:35,961 --> 01:09:37,340
he can't give them away,

1108
01:09:37,490 --> 01:09:42,430
he can't kill them and they
stick with him and uh, he,

1109
01:09:42,460 --> 01:09:47,000
you know, he alone then those are the
ideas he conceived, he considers pursuing.

1110
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:47,871
So in a way,

1111
01:09:47,871 --> 01:09:52,871
giving ideas away is one of his filters
for determining what he should work on

1112
01:09:54,051 --> 01:09:56,900
because he is, he's a man
of a lot of ideas. He might
have 20 different projects,

1113
01:09:56,930 --> 01:10:00,470
right? The ones he can't
give a give away. Uh,

1114
01:10:01,220 --> 01:10:03,860
when that group overlaps
with, or I should say, rather,

1115
01:10:04,250 --> 01:10:07,490
when you combine the ones he can't
give away with the ones that, uh,

1116
01:10:08,030 --> 01:10:11,840
he can't kill because he can't find
flaws in them, some fatal flaw.

1117
01:10:12,170 --> 01:10:13,240
Those are the projects ends up.

1118
01:10:13,290 --> 01:10:15,630
That's so interesting. I love that. Yeah.

1119
01:10:15,990 --> 01:10:18,130
So we were, but we were, uh, we were,

1120
01:10:18,131 --> 01:10:21,660
we were talking about earlier on
being grateful for the little things.

1121
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:26,520
And then Neil came up because he
wrote this rolling stone piece on the,

1122
01:10:26,650 --> 01:10:30,030
the age of fear and how
everyone's terrified and
thinks that the world's going

1123
01:10:30,031 --> 01:10:33,180
to hell in a hand basket and every
possible respect. But objectively,

1124
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:35,130
things seem pretty good.

1125
01:10:35,230 --> 01:10:39,130
Oh yeah. I totally believe that. And, and
there's that great Steven pinker book,

1126
01:10:39,131 --> 01:10:40,450
the better angels of our nature,

1127
01:10:40,451 --> 01:10:44,050
which traces the history of violence
and how we are in the safest time ever,

1128
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:49,420
even with the horrors of the 20 20th
century wars. And, um, yeah, and I,

1129
01:10:49,570 --> 01:10:54,130
uh, there was a great magazine called
mental floss that just folded a month ago,

1130
01:10:54,190 --> 01:10:58,560
but they still have a web presence.
And I wrote a monthly column. Uh,

1131
01:10:59,470 --> 01:11:03,040
I can't remember. I want it to
call it the good old days sucked.

1132
01:11:03,340 --> 01:11:07,750
But I don't think it ended up being called
that, but, but the premise was we all,

1133
01:11:07,780 --> 01:11:12,120
we have this powder and problems. Oh yeah,
exactly. Modern problem. There we go.

1134
01:11:12,340 --> 01:11:15,380
You are, let me see.
You're better than me. Uh,

1135
01:11:15,870 --> 01:11:19,350
I just happened to read your Wikipedia
more, more recently than you.

1136
01:11:20,790 --> 01:11:21,900
Uh,
yeah,

1137
01:11:21,901 --> 01:11:26,490
so the idea was every month I would
take a different topic and shell how

1138
01:11:26,491 --> 01:11:31,290
horrible life used to be and, and
how grateful we should be. You know,

1139
01:11:31,291 --> 01:11:32,130
not all of us,

1140
01:11:32,131 --> 01:11:36,270
there are still people in other countries
and even in our country living in

1141
01:11:36,271 --> 01:11:39,000
horrible conditions. But
uh, if you're lucky enough,

1142
01:11:39,510 --> 01:11:43,980
we live in by far the best times.
And there are so many examples I did.

1143
01:11:43,981 --> 01:11:48,030
The first one I think was on
medicine and the one that came, uh,

1144
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:52,320
the one I talked about in the first
paragraph I believe was the, uh,

1145
01:11:52,350 --> 01:11:56,850
the smoke enema, left tobacco,
Anima, which is, you know,

1146
01:11:56,851 --> 01:12:01,260
the phrase blow smoke up your ass.
Like that was a literal thing.

1147
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:06,560
It came because they would have a hose
and a and a pump and they would shoot

1148
01:12:07,530 --> 01:12:10,070
tobacco up your butt,
uh,

1149
01:12:10,470 --> 01:12:13,860
because they believed that it was good
for your stomach and good for your health

1150
01:12:13,861 --> 01:12:17,460
kid. This might explain something that
I've been trying to figure out for

1151
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:21,191
years now.

1152
01:12:21,191 --> 01:12:26,191
So a friend of mine sent me a photograph
of the menu of a whorehouse in like the

1153
01:12:28,651 --> 01:12:33,540
early 18 hundreds and it was
like blow job, $2, you know,

1154
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:37,560
whatever. This type of sex,
$3, this type of sex, $1.

1155
01:12:37,561 --> 01:12:41,190
And then it had smoke up the ass
$30. And I was like, wait a second,

1156
01:12:42,150 --> 01:12:44,100
I want to know what the
smoke up the ass is about.

1157
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:47,010
I was very curious because
it's like what was the,

1158
01:12:47,190 --> 01:12:51,420
but maybe this was actually like the
medicinal option of the venue. Exactly.

1159
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:55,560
It was like,
that is fascinating.

1160
01:12:55,561 --> 01:13:00,561
How did something not so highly prized
come to be associated with a deceitful

1161
01:13:00,751 --> 01:13:04,700
flattery? Blowing smoke up your ass.
It is, it's a weird, a weird segue.

1162
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:09,510
Uh, I don't know. Let to make, all right,
so the tobacco enema back in the day.

1163
01:13:09,540 --> 01:13:14,070
So yeah. Uh, I'm sure you can still find
it. I'm sure there's someone out there.

1164
01:13:14,071 --> 01:13:18,180
If you Google it, uh, oh, you
know what else to be thankful.

1165
01:13:18,181 --> 01:13:20,330
If you era for feeling down,
uh,

1166
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:25,000
I would Google the words surgery
without anesthesia and uh,

1167
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:30,680
and read the first person accounts of
people who had surgery and it is just,

1168
01:13:32,310 --> 01:13:34,290
Oh my God,
it is just,

1169
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:39,060
does not sound appealing or pleasant
in the least? No, it was cray. Yeah.

1170
01:13:39,061 --> 01:13:43,440
This one woman wrote one and it was just,
you know, I couldn't sleep for days,

1171
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:48,060
so even when I'm going to the
hospital for a procedure, I'm like,

1172
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:53,070
all right, at least we got anesthesia
so it has made my life better.

1173
01:13:53,071 --> 01:13:56,040
This idea and, uh, people out there.

1174
01:13:56,041 --> 01:13:58,650
You can definitely find
Neil's piece on this as well,

1175
01:13:58,651 --> 01:14:03,610
which I think is a good two
good recalibration. Yeah.

1176
01:14:03,660 --> 01:14:06,240
I remember something was
really bothering me. Uh,

1177
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:09,840
I was maybe I ran across
something about isis,

1178
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:12,050
drowning people in cages or,

1179
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:15,010
or burning people alive, both of which
are of course, horrible, horrible,

1180
01:14:15,011 --> 01:14:18,900
horrible things. And I was having a
conversation with someone I won't mention,

1181
01:14:18,901 --> 01:14:23,340
but very, very famous and successful
technologists. And he said, well,

1182
01:14:23,910 --> 01:14:27,030
he's like all terrible, but thank God
we're not in the Middle Ages. He's like,

1183
01:14:27,660 --> 01:14:32,020
broadly speaking, humanity would be much
worse off than we are right now with,

1184
01:14:32,021 --> 01:14:33,030
with these edge cases.

1185
01:14:33,460 --> 01:14:34,293
Absolutely.

1186
01:14:34,510 --> 01:14:39,250
And on that theme you can also
Google Louis C K on Conan.

1187
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:43,840
I think it's something like everything
is great and everyone's miserable.

1188
01:14:44,430 --> 01:14:47,410
Yes. All right. So as far as long as
you're doing stand up, I was, I was,

1189
01:14:47,550 --> 01:14:48,690
I was not going to mention this,

1190
01:14:48,691 --> 01:14:51,510
but I will because I think it's so
hilarious living in San Francisco.

1191
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:56,900
I get a overdosed on San
Francisco sometimes and there
may be a place for this.

1192
01:14:57,411 --> 01:15:02,411
So people out there who are aficionados
try not to freak out and just laugh at,

1193
01:15:03,250 --> 01:15:07,740
uh, yourselves or laugh at this because
I think it's pretty funny. Patton Oswald.

1194
01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:11,090
So one of my favorite
comedians has this piece, uh,

1195
01:15:11,130 --> 01:15:13,070
where he opens in effect
saying, you know, if,

1196
01:15:13,100 --> 01:15:18,100
if one of my whole foods friends
lectures me one more time on home birth,

1197
01:15:18,191 --> 01:15:22,180
so I'm going to punch all the soy and
the planet and he goes on to talk about,

1198
01:15:22,181 --> 01:15:23,710
and I'm not going to do it justice,
but he's like,

1199
01:15:23,711 --> 01:15:28,090
you know what women were dreaming about
on the frontier when there were like

1200
01:15:28,091 --> 01:15:32,400
squatting on the mud in a shack,
giving birth hospitals,

1201
01:15:32,420 --> 01:15:36,430
these amazing sterile environments
where you didn't have to worry about the

1202
01:15:36,431 --> 01:15:39,380
wolverines sneaking in and
stealing the afterbirth. And He, I,

1203
01:15:39,390 --> 01:15:43,140
I want people to listen to it cause I
think it's so good. I love that. Uh, yeah,

1204
01:15:43,150 --> 01:15:46,930
it's easy to Romanticize it itself and
the good old days when in fact the good

1205
01:15:46,931 --> 01:15:51,000
old days are very frequently terrible,
terrible. The terrible old is

1206
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:55,320
fat. And actually that brings to mind
when I was researching the Bible, uh,

1207
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:59,480
there is a line in the
Bible where God says,

1208
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:02,870
because of Eve eating the apple,
uh,

1209
01:16:02,871 --> 01:16:07,871
women shell have pain in childbirth and
when anesthesia for childbirth was first

1210
01:16:09,341 --> 01:16:14,050
introduced, there were some, uh, super
religious people who are like, oh no,

1211
01:16:14,051 --> 01:16:17,470
we can't have that. Women
have to suffer. And a,

1212
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:22,150
so thank God I and my wife,
she was like,

1213
01:16:22,330 --> 01:16:24,730
gimme that drug Kimmy,
give it to me now.

1214
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:29,620
It was no chance she was going to
do it naturally. How did you choose,

1215
01:16:29,660 --> 01:16:33,190
use your [inaudible] projects?
I mean these,

1216
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:38,050
these are big projects, book projects,
very time consuming. What are,

1217
01:16:38,230 --> 01:16:42,350
what are some of the, and maybe
this is a way to to edge into it.

1218
01:16:42,410 --> 01:16:47,120
What are some of the ideas you came close
to doing that you ended up not doing

1219
01:16:47,121 --> 01:16:47,954
it?

1220
01:16:47,990 --> 01:16:50,780
Uh, yeah. Well, there
was the, the Kama Sutra,

1221
01:16:50,781 --> 01:16:55,070
which my life up vetoing the
Bosch on. Uh, I think, uh,

1222
01:16:55,090 --> 01:16:57,540
the answer and maybe
not the most surprising,

1223
01:16:57,550 --> 01:17:01,600
but I have to be totally
passionate about it because, uh,

1224
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:05,480
it can't just be something that I think
will be popular and has to be something

1225
01:17:05,481 --> 01:17:10,250
that I am super excited about.
Cause like you, uh, you know,

1226
01:17:10,370 --> 01:17:15,370
I commit to these things and maybe
not to the level of Tim Ferriss,

1227
01:17:16,071 --> 01:17:20,150
but I do, I go in, I go in hard and I try,

1228
01:17:20,151 --> 01:17:24,650
I try to be Tim Ferris, he or
my, I am the less successful,

1229
01:17:24,651 --> 01:17:27,030
less famous Paris.
Uh,

1230
01:17:27,470 --> 01:17:31,680
but how many best sellers should bad for
you're ahead of me bow not in tonight

1231
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:36,470
in terms of quantity. Uh, but
yeah, I would say there's that.

1232
01:17:36,471 --> 01:17:40,250
And
if it makes me laugh,

1233
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:43,730
I once talked to a daily show writer,
uh,

1234
01:17:43,820 --> 01:17:48,820
about his writing process and he said
one of the most important things to him

1235
01:17:49,220 --> 01:17:53,120
was that he could surprise
himself while he was writing.

1236
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:57,770
And I love that idea.
Just being able to surprise yourself.

1237
01:17:58,130 --> 01:18:01,370
And I feel that same way about big ideas.

1238
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:05,990
You have to the like when you come
up with the idea, you'd be like,

1239
01:18:05,991 --> 01:18:08,630
Oh man, I love that idea. I like you.

1240
01:18:08,690 --> 01:18:13,640
You amuse yourself or just going
like, hmm, when that happens,

1241
01:18:13,790 --> 01:18:17,510
I've tried to become better at that
because I've noticed a Bj Novak who's a

1242
01:18:17,540 --> 01:18:21,800
fantastic writer and a excellent of
course actor and everything else,

1243
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:26,720
producer, well known for the office
and many other things. But uh, he,

1244
01:18:26,721 --> 01:18:27,770
Scott Adams as well,

1245
01:18:27,771 --> 01:18:32,420
creator of Dilbert really pay a lot of
attention to the kinesthetic sort of body

1246
01:18:32,421 --> 01:18:36,410
response to what they're writing.
And so I've tried to really,

1247
01:18:36,411 --> 01:18:41,030
really hone in on paying more attention
to that as I'm writing or drafting or

1248
01:18:41,031 --> 01:18:43,940
brainstorming or anything that's
only making a note here that,

1249
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,530
cause I've never talked about this,

1250
01:18:45,531 --> 01:18:50,480
but when I'm writing and I write
something that I, I think might be funny,

1251
01:18:50,481 --> 01:18:55,481
I can tell there's sort of a
little ping in the back of my head,

1252
01:18:55,521 --> 01:18:59,000
like a little dopamine rush and yeah,

1253
01:18:59,001 --> 01:19:02,600
I do try to pay attention to that.
That's so interesting. I never,

1254
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:07,310
never verbalized it. Um, and
then just the idea I do love,

1255
01:19:07,311 --> 01:19:09,910
like I think you do is taking,
uh,

1256
01:19:09,950 --> 01:19:14,300
an idea and just pushing it to its logical
extreme just to reductio ad absurdum.

1257
01:19:14,301 --> 01:19:18,890
So like, you know, when I first read
about outsourcing and I was like,

1258
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:22,900
well this is cool,
how can I push this to the extreme?

1259
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:26,730
How can I outsource every
single thing in the world? Uh,

1260
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:30,560
and that's how I came up with
the idea for, for those folks,

1261
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:35,600
beauty of Reductio ad absurdum
also underestimated and
I think its power and its

1262
01:19:36,471 --> 01:19:41,330
humor. Uh, why so you were saying I
have to be really excited about it.

1263
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:44,930
I have to on some level maybe
find a funny why genealogy.

1264
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:50,870
Well then not something that people
generally think of as the slapping.

1265
01:19:51,350 --> 01:19:54,860
It's true. Well genealogy is a dean.
Yeah. I try not to use that word.

1266
01:19:54,861 --> 01:19:58,780
I say a family history that sounds, but
there we go. Really connections or, uh,

1267
01:19:59,210 --> 01:20:02,770
but this came about because a
couple of years ago I was, uh,

1268
01:20:02,870 --> 01:20:05,630
at my desk and I got an
email from a guy and he said,

1269
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:10,170
you don't know me but your 12th
cousin. And I thought, okay,

1270
01:20:10,710 --> 01:20:12,990
next comes,
he's going to say please,

1271
01:20:12,991 --> 01:20:17,610
why are $10,000 to my name Nigerian
bank account? But he didn't.

1272
01:20:17,670 --> 01:20:21,000
And I looked into it more.
And he's one of this group people,

1273
01:20:21,030 --> 01:20:23,980
they're researchers and scientists,
uh,

1274
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:28,860
and geneticists who are building a family
tree, the biggest family tree ever,

1275
01:20:28,861 --> 01:20:33,450
the biggest possible family tree ever
of every human on earth connecting

1276
01:20:33,451 --> 01:20:37,530
everyone on earth in one family
tree. And I was like, that is a bold,

1277
01:20:37,531 --> 01:20:42,030
crazy idea. I love it. So
that's how I dove into it. And,

1278
01:20:42,290 --> 01:20:46,080
and it's crazy. You know, as I say,
there are two ways you do it with DNA,

1279
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:51,000
but one way is on the Internet where
you almost a Wikipedia like model where

1280
01:20:51,540 --> 01:20:55,080
thousands, millions of people are
working on the same big family tree.

1281
01:20:55,380 --> 01:20:58,680
So I'm on this tree,
which now has 100 million people.

1282
01:20:59,130 --> 01:21:03,120
And one of the fun things that will take
up like a week of your life as he can

1283
01:21:03,121 --> 01:21:05,850
figure out how you're related
to almost anyone else.

1284
01:21:06,030 --> 01:21:08,190
Like Barack Obama for instance.

1285
01:21:08,191 --> 01:21:13,191
This is true is my fifth grade aunt's
husband's brother's wife's seventh great

1286
01:21:13,621 --> 01:21:16,500
nephew. So, uh, so we're pretty close.

1287
01:21:16,501 --> 01:21:19,830
I'm sure when he's out of office
soon he'll be hang in with me.

1288
01:21:20,130 --> 01:21:24,480
So I loved this idea.
It's like six degrees of Kevin Bacon,

1289
01:21:24,481 --> 01:21:27,450
but everyone is Kevin Bacon. Uh, and,

1290
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:30,420
and I became entranced and I
decided this is my next book.

1291
01:21:31,110 --> 01:21:32,550
And for your listeners,

1292
01:21:32,551 --> 01:21:37,551
actually it has very practical
implications because you
were article here on the

1293
01:21:38,641 --> 01:21:41,310
Tim Ferriss show. Yeah.
This is, uh, this is a,

1294
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:45,030
this is a tool I believe four titans or,

1295
01:21:45,750 --> 01:21:50,460
or non titans. But it is, it's like
the greatest social network ever.

1296
01:21:50,461 --> 01:21:54,450
It's like linkedin on
steroids because I was trying,

1297
01:21:54,630 --> 01:21:58,770
I threw an event of trying to hold the
biggest family reunion ever and I needed

1298
01:21:58,771 --> 01:22:03,510
publicity. So I would find
a reporter or a TV producer.

1299
01:22:03,660 --> 01:22:08,070
I would figure out how I was related to
them. I would send them an email and say,

1300
01:22:08,550 --> 01:22:13,530
listen, this may sound weird, but
you are my, uh, seventh cousin,

1301
01:22:13,531 --> 01:22:17,670
three times removed, husband's son. Uh,

1302
01:22:18,450 --> 01:22:19,740
so we're,
we're family.

1303
01:22:19,830 --> 01:22:24,830
Would you do a favor for a cousin
and write about my project?

1304
01:22:25,620 --> 01:22:29,930
And I'd say, you know, 20% of the time
they were freaked out and like, you know,

1305
01:22:29,970 --> 01:22:34,290
stop stalking me. But 80% of the time
they were intrigued. They're like, really?

1306
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:36,320
We're cousin. Oh, that's
so interesting. And,

1307
01:22:36,620 --> 01:22:41,520
and I got more publicity that way than
anything. So what was the subject line?

1308
01:22:41,610 --> 01:22:43,960
Do you remember what the subject
line it might've been? Uh,

1309
01:22:43,990 --> 01:22:48,600
I think it was from Asia. Your relative?
Yeah, from Adj, your distant cousin.

1310
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:50,790
I wanted to,
for my book about it,

1311
01:22:50,791 --> 01:22:55,140
I wanted to interview George h w Bush.

1312
01:22:55,230 --> 01:22:58,650
So, you know, cause he's
like, got this huge family.

1313
01:22:59,340 --> 01:23:04,050
So I emailed his chief of staff and
is like, you know, uh, and she said,

1314
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:08,050
oh, we're where he's not doing interviews.
And I said, well, but I am a cousin.

1315
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:12,100
She's like, oh, well your cousin,
I guess we can make an exception,

1316
01:23:12,870 --> 01:23:16,820
probably go down and interview them.
So until for,

1317
01:23:16,870 --> 01:23:20,170
for another like three years, this will
work and then everyone will realize,

1318
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:22,600
oh wait, everyone's cousins. So, uh,

1319
01:23:22,630 --> 01:23:25,360
but I highly recommend
it as a strategy for now.

1320
01:23:25,550 --> 01:23:28,660
Gotta make it gotta make it
count while you can. Right. Uh,

1321
01:23:29,110 --> 01:23:33,010
why did you decide to do a podcast?

1322
01:23:33,910 --> 01:23:37,960
Yes. I am now a number of fans,

1323
01:23:38,540 --> 01:23:39,830
uh,

1324
01:23:41,020 --> 01:23:46,020
of yours and mine said they'd
love to your audio books.

1325
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:51,060
Ah, that's nice. And have you,

1326
01:23:52,060 --> 01:23:52,601
God,
you know,

1327
01:23:52,601 --> 01:23:55,750
this went in a need to edit this out
if this is not the right anecdote,

1328
01:23:55,751 --> 01:24:00,520
but I could swear that you told me at
some point that you went into record your

1329
01:24:00,521 --> 01:24:04,240
audio book and the People at the studio,

1330
01:24:04,900 --> 01:24:09,700
I want to say this was you. They
said, well, you seem to have a cold,

1331
01:24:09,701 --> 01:24:12,970
so why don't you come back when
you don't have a cold? Is this,

1332
01:24:12,971 --> 01:24:15,820
is this the right story? Oh, that's
hilarious. But I, you know what,

1333
01:24:15,850 --> 01:24:19,010
it might well have been, I don't
trust my memory. So I have a,

1334
01:24:19,690 --> 01:24:23,200
one of my friends at least who, who has
gone on Abe's, you or somebody else.

1335
01:24:23,530 --> 01:24:27,670
And he, he went into record his
audio book and he was so excited

1336
01:24:29,290 --> 01:24:32,170
when they went on to be hugely successful.
And the Andy,

1337
01:24:32,260 --> 01:24:34,960
he recorded for a 10 minutes and
the producer and the students like,

1338
01:24:34,961 --> 01:24:39,700
you know what, let's, let's take a
break. And, uh, when, uh, what we have,

1339
01:24:39,701 --> 01:24:41,920
you come in in a few days when you're
cold is over. And he's like, no,

1340
01:24:41,921 --> 01:24:44,140
I don't have a goal. This is
just what I sound like. Love it.

1341
01:24:44,141 --> 01:24:48,380
I know I have an odd voice. I
have an invoice. It hasn't, uh,

1342
01:24:48,430 --> 01:24:51,070
it hasn't hindered me to my own.
I'm not saying you have an odd voice.

1343
01:24:51,071 --> 01:24:53,980
I was bringing it up because I thought
that it was from you, but I love that.

1344
01:24:54,010 --> 01:24:57,010
Well, I will tell you when I had
recorded my audio book, I, um,

1345
01:24:57,400 --> 01:25:01,600
I apparently had a very active stomach.
I, and so it was growing a lot.

1346
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:02,411
Uh,

1347
01:25:02,411 --> 01:25:05,800
so I had to do a lot of rethinks and I
was apologize and the producers and they

1348
01:25:05,801 --> 01:25:08,590
said, no, no to everyone
that have with everyone.

1349
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:13,800
And they in fact had a file of all these
famous authors like body sounds like,

1350
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:19,600
like Susan Sontag's farts or
whatever. Uh, and I was like,

1351
01:25:19,601 --> 01:25:23,200
you got to put that out.
Like that would be the most awesome album,

1352
01:25:23,710 --> 01:25:28,420
famous people's bodily functions.
Uh, but I don't think they did.

1353
01:25:28,450 --> 01:25:33,220
So anyway, the podcast, so I took us off
the rails podcast. I'm very excited about.

1354
01:25:33,250 --> 01:25:34,040
It's a,

1355
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:39,040
it's called twice removed and it's sort
of an interview show mixed with hardcore

1356
01:25:39,971 --> 01:25:44,140
history mixed with a game show.
So it's an odd mix.

1357
01:25:44,170 --> 01:25:49,170
And the idea is we take a notable person
and then we go through their family

1358
01:25:50,410 --> 01:25:55,410
history and find the most interesting
inspirational stories and then talk about

1359
01:25:56,111 --> 01:25:56,440
those.

1360
01:25:56,440 --> 01:26:00,850
And then at the end we introduced them
to a cousin they didn't know they had.

1361
01:26:01,450 --> 01:26:04,700
So it's sort of this like surprise ending.

1362
01:26:04,701 --> 01:26:09,110
And it could be someone
like that bear their hero,

1363
01:26:09,170 --> 01:26:13,220
maybe their mentor. It could be a, you
know, an ex girlfriend. It could be.

1364
01:26:13,820 --> 01:26:18,040
It could be anyone. And we don't,
we haven't done that yet, but,

1365
01:26:18,420 --> 01:26:23,180
uh, but yeah,

1366
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:27,770
exactly. You, our wives, we all
our cousins with your spouse. Uh,

1367
01:26:28,010 --> 01:26:28,910
but yeah, no, I,

1368
01:26:29,090 --> 01:26:34,090
and it's being produced
by Gimlet who start up,

1369
01:26:34,700 --> 01:26:39,680
uh, which I'm sure because you're
friends with Chris Saka and so,

1370
01:26:39,681 --> 01:26:43,970
uh, yeah, uh, startup,
which is, as you might know,

1371
01:26:44,490 --> 01:26:46,240
your listeners might know. It's like, uh,

1372
01:26:46,340 --> 01:26:50,770
it was a podcast about starting
a podcast company, very metta.

1373
01:26:51,350 --> 01:26:52,100
Um,

1374
01:26:52,100 --> 01:26:56,780
so they are doing it and they
are amazing because they are,

1375
01:26:57,680 --> 01:27:01,490
they're all like this
American life, uh, alumns.

1376
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:06,550
And so they are just so good at editing
and crafting the story and music.

1377
01:27:06,891 --> 01:27:08,540
And I,
I know nothing about it.

1378
01:27:08,541 --> 01:27:12,760
So it's been a fascinating learning
experience and learning also how to tell

1379
01:27:12,770 --> 01:27:17,690
stories in an audio way, which
is just different. And, uh,

1380
01:27:17,990 --> 01:27:22,970
so I've, I've found it, uh,
it's fascinating. Uh, it's been,

1381
01:27:23,010 --> 01:27:27,800
uh, uh, we'll see. We'll see how it
does, but I'm, I'm excited. Yeah.

1382
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:31,520
They have a really good team. I
mean, Alex Bloomberg, he's actually,

1383
01:27:31,521 --> 01:27:33,170
he's also in tools of titans.
Really,

1384
01:27:33,171 --> 01:27:35,100
really good at asking
questions because he's, he's,

1385
01:27:35,300 --> 01:27:40,220
he records really long tape and is
good at eliciting emotion and stories

1386
01:27:40,250 --> 01:27:44,240
specifically like you said, from interview
subjects. And he, uh, he gives me,

1387
01:27:44,241 --> 01:27:47,090
I'm sure I, since you interviewed
him, like, yeah, the silence.

1388
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:51,230
He's like brilliant at using the silence.
Just like waiting on,

1389
01:27:51,260 --> 01:27:54,440
getting the silence, do the work.
Oh yeah. He's really, really good.

1390
01:27:54,530 --> 01:27:58,670
And they've had a whole string of
really successful shows me and reply all

1391
01:27:58,970 --> 01:28:03,680
mystery show. They've had a very,
very consistent hit rate. So, uh,

1392
01:28:04,470 --> 01:28:08,600
cost. I will be certainly
checking that out. And uh,

1393
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:12,200
and we actually had one that's sort of
related to some of the stuff you do.

1394
01:28:12,201 --> 01:28:17,060
We had, um, Abby Jacobson
who's on broad city,

1395
01:28:17,061 --> 01:28:21,980
she's a hilarious comedian, but one of
her ancestors was this entrepreneur,

1396
01:28:22,250 --> 01:28:23,480
a woman entrepreneur.

1397
01:28:23,481 --> 01:28:27,640
So we did like a whole segment on female
entrepreneurs through history, uh,

1398
01:28:27,720 --> 01:28:32,000
including Betsy Ross. Like we all
think of her dislike, so in the flag.

1399
01:28:32,001 --> 01:28:36,470
But apparently she's like, she had
like a team. She was, cause she was,

1400
01:28:36,650 --> 01:28:40,440
she was a kitten. Yeah.
Uh, and same with, um,

1401
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:42,410
JFK is great.

1402
01:28:42,411 --> 01:28:47,230
Grandma came over and opened
a like a button shop and it's,

1403
01:28:47,300 --> 01:28:51,020
the Kennedys would not have existed
if she hadn't been an entrepreneur and

1404
01:28:51,021 --> 01:28:56,021
funded her kids' education and then they
whatever got into liquor and then that

1405
01:28:56,601 --> 01:28:59,900
spawned the political dynasty,
the gateway to all good things.

1406
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:02,350
Is it

1407
01:29:02,350 --> 01:29:07,350
to you or of course going
to be promoting the podcast?

1408
01:29:07,470 --> 01:29:10,770
You've promoted books in the past,

1409
01:29:10,980 --> 01:29:15,340
done various types of PR and marketing.
Uh,

1410
01:29:16,770 --> 01:29:20,460
one of the bullets that I
wanted to talk about was,

1411
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:25,140
and this is in your voice, but how I
learned to love marketing these, a lot of,

1412
01:29:25,170 --> 01:29:26,370
a lot of authors,

1413
01:29:26,940 --> 01:29:31,940
a lot of artists certainly
think of marketing as a
sullying their hands with the

1414
01:29:33,220 --> 01:29:37,850
dirty work of commercialism or, uh, a,

1415
01:29:37,880 --> 01:29:42,020
an evil to be avoided.
So how did you learn to

1416
01:29:42,460 --> 01:29:45,790
I didn't, well, you know, partly
inspired by Tim Ferris. Uh,

1417
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:50,350
but partly it was,
I reframed marketing,

1418
01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:55,480
I'm trying to think of it, not as the
sullying, uh, that selling my art,

1419
01:29:55,990 --> 01:29:59,290
but as something that could
be creative in its own right.

1420
01:29:59,650 --> 01:30:02,470
And part of this was I interviewed
the artist Christo, you know,

1421
01:30:02,471 --> 01:30:06,790
the guy who raps islands and uh,
the, the gates in central park,

1422
01:30:06,791 --> 01:30:08,920
a really interesting guy.

1423
01:30:09,310 --> 01:30:14,310
And he was working on this
one project for 24 years.

1424
01:30:14,820 --> 01:30:18,810
He was trying to put up
these gates in central park,

1425
01:30:18,811 --> 01:30:23,160
these like flat, uh, these curtains
and arches in central park,

1426
01:30:23,161 --> 01:30:26,100
like 10,000 orange, uh, arches.

1427
01:30:26,340 --> 01:30:31,340
And he had to deal with city
bureaucracy for 24 years.

1428
01:30:31,691 --> 01:30:36,600
So I asked him, you know,
God, that must have been so
frustrating. And he said, well,

1429
01:30:36,601 --> 01:30:37,980
yes and no.
He said,

1430
01:30:38,220 --> 01:30:43,220
I actually see dealing
with the bureaucracy and as
part of my art is like all

1431
01:30:44,321 --> 01:30:47,140
part of one big art project.
Uh,

1432
01:30:47,141 --> 01:30:51,140
so I don't separate it from the
actual designing of the, uh,

1433
01:30:51,620 --> 01:30:55,120
of the pieces. And I was like, that's
an interesting way to look at it.

1434
01:30:55,240 --> 01:31:00,240
So I tried to apply that to marketing
and instead of seeing it as this horrible

1435
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:04,360
pain in the ass, like, what can
I do that's creative with it?

1436
01:31:04,690 --> 01:31:09,690
And one of the things when I was
doing the year of living biblically,

1437
01:31:09,691 --> 01:31:10,860
for instance,
I was like,

1438
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:15,920
how can I a section this off so it,
uh,

1439
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:21,400
I can appeal to like
50 different audiences.

1440
01:31:22,730 --> 01:31:27,290
So I wrote a piece for a music
magazine about music in the Bible.

1441
01:31:27,470 --> 01:31:30,410
Uh,
I did for Glamour magazine.

1442
01:31:30,411 --> 01:31:32,930
I wrote sex advice in
the Bible cause there's,

1443
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:37,210
there's a good amount of sex
in the Bible. Um, and uh,

1444
01:31:37,650 --> 01:31:41,000
and it was actually, it
was very interesting. I've,

1445
01:31:41,130 --> 01:31:46,130
I became a fan of this way of
thinking as opposed to being an end.

1446
01:31:47,181 --> 01:31:49,790
The same thing with speeches.
I used to hate giving speeches,

1447
01:31:50,090 --> 01:31:53,750
but like we said before, the whole
fake it till you make it. Uh, I,

1448
01:31:53,820 --> 01:31:58,490
I forced myself to do every speech I
could and now I just, you know, I love,

1449
01:31:58,491 --> 01:31:59,324
I actually,

1450
01:32:00,120 --> 01:32:04,740
I, I'm not a fan of sitting down
in front of the keyboard, but I,

1451
01:32:04,741 --> 01:32:09,130
I'd much rather be on stage talking.
Well that's part of the, uh,

1452
01:32:10,300 --> 01:32:12,430
the dangerous Siren Song of marketing.

1453
01:32:13,170 --> 01:32:15,400
So when I was working on tools of titans,

1454
01:32:15,430 --> 01:32:19,420
I uses a program called scrivener to put
together my books that I've done that

1455
01:32:19,421 --> 01:32:23,800
for the last three books. And
there is a, I had a working file,

1456
01:32:23,801 --> 01:32:28,801
which was marketing ideas and I found it
was very dangerous to have that within

1457
01:32:29,501 --> 01:32:34,501
a stone's throw of my writing because it
was always easier to or more enjoyable

1458
01:32:36,220 --> 01:32:41,220
for me to work on the marketing ideas
and put off the actual work of writing.

1459
01:32:43,811 --> 01:32:46,940
So it had marketing ideas
and I modified the file name.

1460
01:32:46,941 --> 01:32:50,320
So it was marketing ideas,
Ha Dash,

1461
01:32:50,950 --> 01:32:55,750
focus on writing in all caps,
exclamation points.

1462
01:32:56,280 --> 01:32:57,200
Uh,
that's it.

1463
01:32:57,250 --> 01:33:00,970
But now if you had to rank the different
parts of your job in terms of enjoyment

1464
01:33:01,300 --> 01:33:05,420
and enjoyment that they give you,
what would you say? Well, it's a,

1465
01:33:06,010 --> 01:33:08,410
funny enough,
this past this,

1466
01:33:08,470 --> 01:33:12,460
this last book was the first one
that I've enjoyed writing. I enjoy,

1467
01:33:12,550 --> 01:33:15,250
I love doing what I'm doing right now,

1468
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:18,190
which is my favorite part of
writing without the writing,
right? The interviewing,

1469
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:22,210
I love the interviewing and
the researching. Do. I do
enjoy the experimentation,

1470
01:33:22,211 --> 01:33:24,760
but there's sometimes go
sideways as you and I both know.

1471
01:33:25,150 --> 01:33:29,250
So there's a always turn out
as intended or hoped. Uh,

1472
01:33:29,350 --> 01:33:32,980
and then the probably historically
would have been marketing and then the

1473
01:33:32,981 --> 01:33:37,810
writing, but the writing
was right there. I would say

1474
01:33:39,390 --> 01:33:43,510
yes. Not at par with the marketing, maybe
even ahead of it this time around, which,

1475
01:33:43,550 --> 01:33:45,340
what do you think that was?
Was it the,

1476
01:33:45,450 --> 01:33:48,930
the topic or what did you discover
some who enjoy their work?

1477
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:49,751
There were a few things.

1478
01:33:49,751 --> 01:33:54,751
I think that primarily it was the
enjoyment and assimilation of,

1479
01:33:57,480 --> 01:33:58,271
this is kind of Meta,

1480
01:33:58,271 --> 01:34:03,271
but absorbing the lessons
and recommendations of the
people I interviewed as I

1481
01:34:06,251 --> 01:34:10,600
was editing and reviewing and taking
multiple passes on these chapters.

1482
01:34:10,630 --> 01:34:15,070
Interesting. So I was, I was
actually incorporating a lot of the,

1483
01:34:15,130 --> 01:34:17,700
what's an example? Do you remember
one? Sure. Oh yeah, I was,

1484
01:34:17,810 --> 01:34:22,360
I ended up having a routine
where, for instance, I did a,

1485
01:34:22,361 --> 01:34:23,650
used a barrel sauna,

1486
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:27,990
which with the exact same specs as Rick
Ruben who recommended it to me, uh,

1487
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:32,620
and alternated that with cold
exposure at specific times of the day.

1488
01:34:32,650 --> 01:34:33,970
Just like Wim Hoff Wood.

1489
01:34:34,420 --> 01:34:39,160
And in the mornings I would listen to
say a guided meditation from Tara Brock,

1490
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:44,050
specifically the 2010
summer smile meditation,

1491
01:34:44,051 --> 01:34:47,890
which Ray proposal recommended to me.
So I started incorporating,

1492
01:34:47,891 --> 01:34:50,830
and then I would take say exogenous
ketones, which of these powders,

1493
01:34:50,831 --> 01:34:54,100
synthetic ketones, which Dominic
D'Agostino had recommended to me.

1494
01:34:54,101 --> 01:34:56,770
So all of these bits and
pieces from the actual

1495
01:34:58,780 --> 01:35:02,740
became part of my daily routine
for working on the chapters,

1496
01:35:02,830 --> 01:35:06,940
which is kind of wild. And then there's
the deeper kind of philosophical stuff.

1497
01:35:06,941 --> 01:35:11,500
I was writing this mostly over the summer
and early fall and there were a few

1498
01:35:11,501 --> 01:35:12,610
people in the book,

1499
01:35:12,611 --> 01:35:16,420
like Bj Miller who is a palliative
care physician who's helped more than

1500
01:35:16,420 --> 01:35:19,540
thousand people die. Ed Cooke,
memory champion who taught,

1501
01:35:19,541 --> 01:35:23,740
you might remember a book
called moonwalking with
Einstein. Yeah. So Ed Cooke is,

1502
01:35:23,741 --> 01:35:28,220
who is the the memory champion
slash coach who taught in this case?

1503
01:35:28,221 --> 01:35:31,520
I think it was Joshua Four.
Yeah, there's four brothers.

1504
01:35:32,120 --> 01:35:35,330
Both amazing writers. Uh, three of
you now there are three. That's right.

1505
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:41,070
So to become national membrane champion
in the U S in one year. So Ed Cooke,

1506
01:35:41,410 --> 01:35:42,141
NBJ Miller,

1507
01:35:42,141 --> 01:35:46,790
both use stargazing is a way to reduce
anxiety and they both have particular

1508
01:35:46,791 --> 01:35:48,080
ways that they go about it.
So,

1509
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:53,200
so I did that every night before going
to bed and it just went on and on and on.

1510
01:35:53,750 --> 01:35:56,810
So I think that the subject matter itself
had a huge impact on the writing of

1511
01:35:56,811 --> 01:35:57,200
the book,

1512
01:35:57,200 --> 01:36:02,200
which was unexpected in a
way that is the mark helpful.

1513
01:36:02,650 --> 01:36:02,830
Yeah.

1514
01:36:02,830 --> 01:36:07,580
And the marketing at this point for me
is fun because I try to make it fun in

1515
01:36:07,581 --> 01:36:10,130
the sense that I very often ask myself,

1516
01:36:10,580 --> 01:36:13,940
how can I make the
launch itself PR worthy,

1517
01:36:15,110 --> 01:36:19,400
if that makes sense. And that forces
me to do sometimes absurd things.

1518
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:23,660
And even if some of the
absurd things are, uh, what,

1519
01:36:23,780 --> 01:36:27,140
what I might consider or people
might consider a waste of money,

1520
01:36:27,560 --> 01:36:30,770
like doing billboards in New York City
right now I have 80 plus billboards in

1521
01:36:30,771 --> 01:36:35,600
New York City with the answers
from guests to the question,

1522
01:36:36,350 --> 01:36:39,260
what would you put on a billboard if
you could put anything on a billboard to

1523
01:36:39,261 --> 01:36:40,850
get a message out to millions of people.

1524
01:36:41,060 --> 01:36:45,170
So we've got all these answers and took
some of my favorites and now they're on

1525
01:36:45,171 --> 01:36:49,130
actual physical billboards all throughout
New York City that probably doesn't

1526
01:36:49,131 --> 01:36:50,090
sell a lot of books.

1527
01:36:50,120 --> 01:36:55,120
But that gives me such childlike joy
to do something that absurd and to make

1528
01:36:58,281 --> 01:37:01,550
guests happy themselves,

1529
01:37:02,450 --> 01:37:06,800
that even if it is a waste of money,
it's probably not a waste of money,

1530
01:37:07,130 --> 01:37:09,500
meaning an isolation.
Maybe it's a waste of money,

1531
01:37:09,501 --> 01:37:14,150
but because of the infusion of enthusiasm
that it's given me an excitement,

1532
01:37:14,151 --> 01:37:16,310
it's created in a,

1533
01:37:16,311 --> 01:37:20,120
among many of the of the guests and
people who ended up in the book.

1534
01:37:20,660 --> 01:37:25,310
It's acted as fuel for a lot of other
things that actually do have a good

1535
01:37:25,490 --> 01:37:27,720
financial return or at
least a clear financial.

1536
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:32,840
I love that. Funny. Yeah. I had a
similar experience. I actually have,

1537
01:37:32,900 --> 01:37:36,470
I'm finishing my book on the family now,

1538
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:40,400
but as part of it last
summer, I through, uh,

1539
01:37:41,330 --> 01:37:45,710
the biggest worldwide
family reunion, uh, ever,

1540
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:49,150
and that was like financially not a great,

1541
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:53,150
but it was,
uh,

1542
01:37:53,510 --> 01:37:57,380
it was so fun and so interesting. Uh, and,

1543
01:37:57,381 --> 01:38:01,620
and I hope raised the profile enough
that it will pay off in the end.

1544
01:38:02,220 --> 01:38:05,670
But, um, yeah, cause it was
like 4,000 people in New York.

1545
01:38:05,671 --> 01:38:09,990
But then there were 40
simultaneous reunions around
the world and sister sledge

1546
01:38:09,991 --> 01:38:14,760
came and saying, we are a
family. One thing, this was a,

1547
01:38:14,761 --> 01:38:18,900
this was a revelation. You know, I was
sister sledge, we are family. I'm like,

1548
01:38:18,901 --> 01:38:22,260
this is the perfect. So this is, uh,

1549
01:38:22,500 --> 01:38:26,380
but it turns out like one of the sisters,
like he's not talking

1550
01:38:26,470 --> 01:38:28,330
to the other lawsuit.

1551
01:38:28,810 --> 01:38:33,250
So their family in the sense that
every family is dysfunctional.

1552
01:38:35,300 --> 01:38:36,133
Uh,

1553
01:38:36,220 --> 01:38:41,110
let's grab a couple of the end questions
and then we'll jump into some rapid

1554
01:38:41,111 --> 01:38:44,320
fire questions. Yeah. This is a
question you probably get a lot.

1555
01:38:44,321 --> 01:38:47,470
I certainly get it a lot,
but I'm curious how you would answer.

1556
01:38:47,471 --> 01:38:51,740
This is from Constantine.
He knows them stiffs of, as,

1557
01:38:51,850 --> 01:38:56,230
I can't pronounce it, but
it's a I. N o z. E m t.

1558
01:38:56,231 --> 01:38:59,800
S. E. V. Which experiment or approached
turned out to be a total dud.

1559
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:02,860
Something that you had extremely high
hopes for? The completely flopped.

1560
01:39:04,250 --> 01:39:08,480
I did star, uh, and you probably will
remember this guy's name, but, uh,

1561
01:39:08,840 --> 01:39:13,250
the man who invented a,
the idea of micro expressions where you,

1562
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:17,990
right Paul? I come in, yes,
there we go. And it was,

1563
01:39:18,020 --> 01:39:23,020
his idea was he was like the
show about the lie catcher,

1564
01:39:23,540 --> 01:39:28,220
you know, the people you can tell who's
lying based on their facial expressions.

1565
01:39:28,730 --> 01:39:33,470
So I interviewed him, great interview,
and I tried it and I just couldn't do it.

1566
01:39:33,471 --> 01:39:34,304
I don't know.

1567
01:39:34,370 --> 01:39:38,680
I don't know whether it's because
it's a pseudoscience or whether,

1568
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:43,940
because it's my failure probably
the ladder, but I, it just,

1569
01:39:44,270 --> 01:39:46,420
uh,
and it's fun to write about failures,

1570
01:39:46,530 --> 01:39:51,530
but not when there's just nothing but
can eat a little know lesson learned.

1571
01:39:51,571 --> 01:39:55,850
Just couldn't do. Exactly. Uh, all right.

1572
01:39:55,851 --> 01:39:59,480
This is from Miguel flea
gear, I think it is, uh,

1573
01:40:00,270 --> 01:40:03,780
book outtakes from your
year of living biblically.

1574
01:40:04,330 --> 01:40:08,660
Is there anything that didn't make it in
that interesting? I did, yes. There was,

1575
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:13,190
in Orlando, there's a theme park
called the Holy Land Experience,

1576
01:40:13,191 --> 01:40:17,180
which is the Disney version of,
uh,

1577
01:40:17,500 --> 01:40:21,900
ancient Jerusalem. And so
you've got, and you know,

1578
01:40:21,910 --> 01:40:25,750
instead of mascots like Disneyworld,
you've got, you know, Jesus,

1579
01:40:25,751 --> 01:40:30,751
you got this guy with robes and the
beard and he's got a little Madonna,

1580
01:40:31,390 --> 01:40:33,610
Ted face, Mike. And he's, you know,

1581
01:40:33,940 --> 01:40:37,020
talk and you've got
these guys like lepers.

1582
01:40:37,410 --> 01:40:41,550
That was my feet like a blind leper
begging on the street with his little

1583
01:40:41,551 --> 01:40:46,470
microphone. Uh, so, and then
they read it. But, but anyway,

1584
01:40:46,471 --> 01:40:51,471
I went there and it could have been
a funny chapter in that it was,

1585
01:40:52,900 --> 01:40:57,250
I found it very ridiculous, but it was
also like shooting fish in a barrel.

1586
01:40:57,251 --> 01:41:00,790
It was like, or I think PJ
O'rourke said, uh, you know,

1587
01:41:00,850 --> 01:41:05,800
shooting cows with a sawed off
shotgun. It was just too easy. And um,

1588
01:41:05,950 --> 01:41:09,550
and there, and there are people,
I'm sure that it was meaningful too.

1589
01:41:09,551 --> 01:41:13,870
So why, why ruin their lives
just for a cheap laugh?

1590
01:41:13,900 --> 01:41:14,920
So that didn't make it,

1591
01:41:16,090 --> 01:41:20,730
so this is, I mean, these
are all related, I suppose.

1592
01:41:20,731 --> 01:41:25,080
This is from Anna Lamont and I'll,
I'll try to simplify this a little bit,

1593
01:41:25,081 --> 01:41:27,090
but that,
or I might rephrase that for I read,

1594
01:41:27,091 --> 01:41:31,540
it would be great to hear you take on
whether it's possible to completely rewire

1595
01:41:31,570 --> 01:41:35,200
our subconscious to ignore the norms
and expectations instilled by society,

1596
01:41:35,201 --> 01:41:38,470
family, environment, et Cetera, or
is it a never any work in progress,

1597
01:41:38,471 --> 01:41:41,140
something that you need to become
aware of and focus on every single day?

1598
01:41:41,440 --> 01:41:45,700
So I think part,
if I could read into this,

1599
01:41:45,730 --> 01:41:49,960
maybe what is being asked is or implied,

1600
01:41:49,961 --> 01:41:52,420
is that we both do all
these crazy experiments.

1601
01:41:53,230 --> 01:41:57,070
How have you trained yourself to ignore
the norms and conventions? But, uh,

1602
01:41:57,130 --> 01:41:58,960
and this was directed at both of us.
For me,

1603
01:41:58,961 --> 01:42:03,370
I would say the writing is
just the ultimate excuse.

1604
01:42:04,090 --> 01:42:04,810
It's the,

1605
01:42:04,810 --> 01:42:09,810
it's the perfect alibi to do any absurd
thing you could possibly conceive of.

1606
01:42:10,061 --> 01:42:12,610
And then just say, I'm doing
it and writing it out. And
people are like, oh, okay.

1607
01:42:12,611 --> 01:42:15,880
Then, I mean, but if you were
doing it seriously, right, if you,

1608
01:42:15,881 --> 01:42:18,760
if you didn't have the pretext of
writing about it for the year of living

1609
01:42:18,761 --> 01:42:21,730
biblically, like I'm sure plenty of
people thought you were crazy anyway,

1610
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:25,600
but there are people who would have
assumed you were completely insane who

1611
01:42:25,601 --> 01:42:28,480
otherwise were like, oh, that's
so genius. Oh, what a great idea.

1612
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:30,700
Yeah, absolutely. I
think that's it. I mean,

1613
01:42:30,701 --> 01:42:35,701
I think if you on a fee yourself as a
method writer or instead of a method actor

1614
01:42:36,671 --> 01:42:41,240
and just get into character, um,
I, I often do that. I'm like,

1615
01:42:41,270 --> 01:42:45,230
I'm going to get into character now. I,
you know, this is not me. This is me.

1616
01:42:45,530 --> 01:42:48,800
And I think that you don't have to
be a writer to do that. Actually,

1617
01:42:48,801 --> 01:42:51,770
I think the idea of
experimenting on your own life,

1618
01:42:51,800 --> 01:42:56,000
even if you're not writing a book, is
I think it's great to just, you know,

1619
01:42:56,030 --> 01:42:58,820
try eight different toothpastes
and see which works.

1620
01:42:59,150 --> 01:43:03,360
But there is a sense where
you have to commit and you're
like, you know what, I'm,

1621
01:43:03,390 --> 01:43:04,810
I'm going to force myself to do this.

1622
01:43:04,811 --> 01:43:07,720
I'm going to take on a character
and I'm going to do it. Uh,

1623
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:10,270
so that I find very helpful.
And I think

1624
01:43:10,370 --> 01:43:15,370
also I would say this to Anne or
anyone is that if you frame something,

1625
01:43:17,781 --> 01:43:19,940
even if you're not writing
about it as an experiment,

1626
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:23,060
I'm doing x for y number of months.

1627
01:43:23,570 --> 01:43:27,710
You also can kind of get away with murder
in the sense that if you're worried

1628
01:43:27,711 --> 01:43:32,711
about trying something unusual
or uncommon and you can get to,

1629
01:43:32,781 --> 01:43:37,420
what should I test by the extension to
reductio ad absurdum, right. Like, okay,

1630
01:43:37,470 --> 01:43:41,450
if people are outsourcing like you did,
what is the most absurd,

1631
01:43:41,870 --> 01:43:45,340
exaggerated place where, where's
the most absurd, exaggerated place?

1632
01:43:45,341 --> 01:43:47,000
I can take this. Yeah,
right. Like, all right.

1633
01:43:47,001 --> 01:43:49,580
Passive aggressive bickering with my wife.

1634
01:43:49,700 --> 01:43:54,040
Like I'm going to have someone that on
my behalf or an uh, or having eaten,

1635
01:43:54,080 --> 01:43:58,130
I actually, ah, you know, this
might be another misattribution
but had no, it's not,

1636
01:43:58,131 --> 01:44:00,860
it's not this one. I think
I'm getting right. Were you,

1637
01:44:01,340 --> 01:44:06,170
you hired someone to be worried
on your behalf? I saw an extreme.

1638
01:44:06,650 --> 01:44:10,100
I thought that was, you found it really
helpful and that sounded so absurd.

1639
01:44:10,101 --> 01:44:11,570
But I remember,
I think it was a four hour body.

1640
01:44:11,571 --> 01:44:13,490
I was really stressed
out about the deadline.

1641
01:44:13,970 --> 01:44:17,870
And so I paid her a virtual assistant
to worry about my deadline for me.

1642
01:44:18,530 --> 01:44:22,670
And it was just, it was
such a weird, uh, form of,

1643
01:44:22,671 --> 01:44:24,080
not necessarily self deception,

1644
01:44:24,081 --> 01:44:28,670
but like taking advantage of a quirk of
human psychology to know that someone

1645
01:44:28,671 --> 01:44:32,810
else was on the job. So then I, I
then, who is your virtual assistant?

1646
01:44:32,811 --> 01:44:37,660
Was it like an Indian or, uh, in from
Philippines. The Philippines. Yeah.

1647
01:44:37,670 --> 01:44:42,210
Good Warriors. Yeah. And
that is awesome. Well, I,

1648
01:44:42,211 --> 01:44:45,620
and I also think calling it an
experiment gives you permission to fail

1649
01:44:47,240 --> 01:44:49,910
because it's an experiment.
Sometimes experiments fail.

1650
01:44:49,910 --> 01:44:53,930
So if you do a change in your life
and say, I'm experimenting with this,

1651
01:44:53,931 --> 01:44:57,370
it makes it, and it reminds me of, uh, uh,

1652
01:44:58,010 --> 01:44:59,300
I'm probably gonna get this wrong,

1653
01:44:59,301 --> 01:45:04,301
but I think it was a French writer named
Montonya who came up with a little word

1654
01:45:04,701 --> 01:45:07,400
essay,
which means to try.

1655
01:45:07,880 --> 01:45:12,530
So that's what I find that so freeing.
Like when you write something,

1656
01:45:12,531 --> 01:45:15,350
it's you're just trying it,
let's try and may work, may not.

1657
01:45:15,710 --> 01:45:19,100
And the more that at least
has been true for me,

1658
01:45:19,101 --> 01:45:24,080
the more experiments you attempt and
the more you try to push the absurd,

1659
01:45:24,600 --> 01:45:26,390
uh,
in certain respects,

1660
01:45:26,510 --> 01:45:30,710
the easier it gets because you realize
the penalties are generally not that

1661
01:45:30,711 --> 01:45:33,500
severe with some of the
stupid stuff that I do at,

1662
01:45:33,501 --> 01:45:36,740
they end up physically being pretty
severe and you can get very injured.

1663
01:45:37,070 --> 01:45:40,400
Like don't try to learn park where in a
week it turns out to be a bad idea for

1664
01:45:40,401 --> 01:45:43,930
your knees. I saw you recently after
that you had done that and you were,

1665
01:45:44,120 --> 01:45:47,480
I was good. I was not in good shape.
He's still have injuries from that.

1666
01:45:47,810 --> 01:45:50,660
But generally if you're doing these,

1667
01:45:50,780 --> 01:45:53,720
these experiments that you think you're
going to be judged very harshly for,

1668
01:45:54,050 --> 01:45:56,750
if you're presenting them in,
in the right way,

1669
01:45:56,751 --> 01:45:59,420
if you feel compelled to explain them,
uh,

1670
01:45:59,810 --> 01:46:02,540
generally they're very few repercussions
and people were actually more

1671
01:46:02,541 --> 01:46:04,370
supportive and interested
in then you would expect.

1672
01:46:04,640 --> 01:46:08,180
And also if you get something good
out of it, uh, for your own life,

1673
01:46:08,210 --> 01:46:12,470
then it's probably worth it.
Unless you inflict massive pain on others.

1674
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:17,300
Like with radical honesty.
Yes. Radical honesty.

1675
01:46:17,750 --> 01:46:19,910
That's the other one I
want to explore a bit.

1676
01:46:19,911 --> 01:46:23,600
There's a great book called
lying by Sam Harris. I read that.

1677
01:46:23,870 --> 01:46:26,630
I think it's a great, great
book. Very complimentary to the,

1678
01:46:26,750 --> 01:46:31,580
I think you're fat as a, uh, okay.

1679
01:46:31,610 --> 01:46:34,640
So here's,
this is from Charlotte Chapman,

1680
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:38,090
most embarrassing
failure at an experiment.

1681
01:46:38,091 --> 01:46:42,200
So aside from the micro
expressions, right? Uh,

1682
01:46:42,230 --> 01:46:46,310
most embarrassing failure and experiment,
did he give up or refine his approach?

1683
01:46:46,490 --> 01:46:50,010
Interesting. Yeah. Well, I mean,
I think my life been a series of

1684
01:46:50,010 --> 01:46:54,810
embarrassments and humiliations.
So in a way you engineer your,

1685
01:46:55,260 --> 01:46:58,440
that's true. I experiments to
be embarrassing. Yes, exactly.

1686
01:46:58,500 --> 01:47:03,300
Because I'd also think that makes me
better, a better copy is, you know,

1687
01:47:03,890 --> 01:47:07,770
and that is actually one thing I was
thinking about that I learned doing this

1688
01:47:07,771 --> 01:47:12,771
podcast is that I'm being humiliated on
radio is actually sometimes makes for

1689
01:47:16,111 --> 01:47:18,430
better radio. So, uh,

1690
01:47:18,990 --> 01:47:23,310
when I'm doing interviews and I ask a
question and the person is like, God,

1691
01:47:23,311 --> 01:47:28,260
that's a dumb question. That is beautiful.
That makes the cut. That's gold.

1692
01:47:28,290 --> 01:47:32,010
Yeah. So I, I may not look that sound,

1693
01:47:32,011 --> 01:47:36,780
that good on the podcast, but I
think it's entertaining. So, um,

1694
01:47:36,990 --> 01:47:41,370
but yeah, I would say many humiliations
I, I don't know if this counts,

1695
01:47:41,371 --> 01:47:43,340
but this is the first one
that comes to mind is, uh,

1696
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:46,770
I was working at Esquire magazine
and we asked the actress,

1697
01:47:46,771 --> 01:47:51,480
Mary Louise Parker to pose
nude. And I was, uh, uh, uh,

1698
01:47:51,481 --> 01:47:55,320
tasked with asking her and she
said, well, I will pose nude,

1699
01:47:55,321 --> 01:47:59,850
but only if the editor of the piece
also poses nude. And I was the editor.

1700
01:48:00,060 --> 01:48:04,680
So, uh, I went to my editor in chief
and he was like, all right, well do it.

1701
01:48:04,710 --> 01:48:06,810
Take off your pants. That's your job. Uh,

1702
01:48:06,920 --> 01:48:11,920
so I had to pose nude for a very
well known celebrity photographer.

1703
01:48:12,300 --> 01:48:16,240
And it was, it was quite humiliating
and, and, uh, vulnerable and,

1704
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:20,820
and also highly insulting
because I was, you know, he was,

1705
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:23,910
he's a big photographer, so you'd
like 10 assistants, like Gorgeous,

1706
01:48:23,911 --> 01:48:28,470
20 something female assistance. And I was
like, oh my God, this is so embarrassing.

1707
01:48:28,830 --> 01:48:32,190
But they could not care less.
They were like, you were like,

1708
01:48:32,490 --> 01:48:36,210
no interest in my nude form.
So that was like,

1709
01:48:36,300 --> 01:48:37,770
that was tough for my ego.

1710
01:48:38,130 --> 01:48:41,970
And then they came out and they actually
published the picture and we got some

1711
01:48:42,390 --> 01:48:47,070
subscription cancellations, I
believe. So it was a, overall,

1712
01:48:47,071 --> 01:48:51,960
I was a, it was a dark
time. All right, let's,

1713
01:48:51,961 --> 01:48:56,730
let's do some rapid fire questions, which
may in fact be misnamed. Uh, but there,

1714
01:48:56,731 --> 01:48:59,100
there's short questions.
The answers don't need to be short.

1715
01:49:00,060 --> 01:49:02,340
When you hear the word successful,

1716
01:49:02,520 --> 01:49:06,570
who's the first person who comes
to mind or who comes to mind?

1717
01:49:07,620 --> 01:49:12,060
Uh, well, this is a little schmaltzy
even answer, but I would say my dad, uh,

1718
01:49:12,061 --> 01:49:16,270
he is a lawyer who loves his job.
Like,

1719
01:49:16,320 --> 01:49:21,090
he literally has no hobbies because only
loves is spending time with his family

1720
01:49:21,091 --> 01:49:25,890
and his job. So if you can derive
that much pleasure from your job,

1721
01:49:26,100 --> 01:49:28,800
uh, I think that's a success. I mean,

1722
01:49:28,801 --> 01:49:31,530
to me they're two criterion for success.

1723
01:49:31,830 --> 01:49:35,040
One is that you're happy and the other
is that you're making the world a better

1724
01:49:35,041 --> 01:49:38,640
place. So, um, and I think he does both.

1725
01:49:39,150 --> 01:49:42,540
And he's also like,
he is definitely in,

1726
01:49:42,900 --> 01:49:47,900
in our genre of like taking
things to the ridiculous extreme.

1727
01:49:48,670 --> 01:49:53,500
He, he writes law books and he holds
the world record for the most number of

1728
01:49:53,501 --> 01:49:55,660
footnotes in a law article.

1729
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:59,850
4,280.
Yeah.

1730
01:50:00,700 --> 01:50:02,740
So he finds something
and he just goes with it.

1731
01:50:02,830 --> 01:50:07,620
Wow. Apple does not fall too far
from the tree on that one. Uh,

1732
01:50:09,630 --> 01:50:12,810
what is, I don't ask this with
everyone, but I'll, I'll ask you,

1733
01:50:12,811 --> 01:50:16,590
what is something you believe that other
people think is insane or that very few

1734
01:50:16,591 --> 01:50:17,610
people who would agree with you on?

1735
01:50:17,860 --> 01:50:22,150
Yeah, I love this question. And there,
there are many, many things. Uh,

1736
01:50:22,480 --> 01:50:25,390
so let me just go over a
couple of them quickly. Uh,

1737
01:50:25,420 --> 01:50:29,080
without trying to alienate too many of
your listeners are so alienated away.

1738
01:50:29,140 --> 01:50:33,150
Yeah, they're tough. All right.
One is a cannibalism. Uh,

1739
01:50:33,900 --> 01:50:35,620
what about it? You're
up. You're a proponent.

1740
01:50:35,650 --> 01:50:38,720
I am a proponent of ethical
camel cannibalism. Okay.

1741
01:50:38,770 --> 01:50:42,970
I'm very interested in excited
about in vitro meat, lab grown meat.

1742
01:50:43,240 --> 01:50:46,720
Like you take a little cell from
a chicken and grow, uh, you know,

1743
01:50:46,721 --> 01:50:48,250
a chicken breast or,
um,

1744
01:50:48,270 --> 01:50:53,270
so I'm very excited that I think in 10
or 20 years it's going to be reality and

1745
01:50:53,471 --> 01:50:57,000
it's going to open up. You don't have
to just eat cows or chickens, you know,

1746
01:50:57,600 --> 01:51:01,090
you get a human burger. Yeah. Human
burial. Well, I was thinking like, yeah,

1747
01:51:01,091 --> 01:51:04,010
giraffe are endangered animals, but
yeah, take it to the extreme. You get,

1748
01:51:04,400 --> 01:51:08,120
what is the harm in eating another human,
a human burger.

1749
01:51:08,360 --> 01:51:10,760
And this is my idea for a startup.
I know.

1750
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:14,240
I think you've pulled back on
angel investing, so yeah. But um,

1751
01:51:14,580 --> 01:51:18,430
and maybe some money. Plenty
of them listening. All
right. This may have already,

1752
01:51:18,431 --> 01:51:22,690
someone may already be doing this,
but my idea is a celebrity meat.

1753
01:51:22,960 --> 01:51:26,760
So like you can eat a Brad Pitt
Burger. Yeah. Either Ebita,

1754
01:51:26,770 --> 01:51:31,420
Clooney Burger or eat a, you know, a
j Lo Burger or, and it could even be

1755
01:51:32,060 --> 01:51:34,780
specific body parts like that.
Little creepy.

1756
01:51:34,781 --> 01:51:38,140
But I wonder what will end up
being the Kobe beef of humans.

1757
01:51:38,470 --> 01:51:41,680
So it's like if you can, if you
can choose gender, race and so on,

1758
01:51:41,820 --> 01:51:45,280
like where do we end up? Right, right.
Yeah. That's interesting. I Dunno,

1759
01:51:45,670 --> 01:51:49,780
I dunno for that. You have questions just
begging to be answered. So cannibalism.

1760
01:51:49,840 --> 01:51:50,800
Okay,
that's one.

1761
01:51:51,100 --> 01:51:55,510
Um, another one I like Sam Harris.
I don't believe in free will,

1762
01:51:55,900 --> 01:51:58,610
which I think,
uh,

1763
01:51:58,680 --> 01:52:01,920
is some people see that as depressing,

1764
01:52:02,010 --> 01:52:06,020
but I actually find it
liberating and when,

1765
01:52:06,660 --> 01:52:11,660
because it's so much easier to forgive
yourself for doing stupid things if he

1766
01:52:11,911 --> 01:52:15,300
realize that you really didn't have,

1767
01:52:15,330 --> 01:52:18,140
there was no other die has been
cast the die as we can endure.

1768
01:52:18,200 --> 01:52:21,600
And I think you're more forgiving of other
people and the stupid things they do.

1769
01:52:21,930 --> 01:52:26,320
No, no. Conversely though wouldn't,
couldn't you also be more uh,

1770
01:52:27,120 --> 01:52:32,120
forgiving or accepting of things that
should not be condoned or is that that

1771
01:52:36,590 --> 01:52:38,740
just come back to the lack of
free will and your, your sort of,

1772
01:52:39,160 --> 01:52:44,160
my feeling is there's a difference
between a fatalism and determinism.

1773
01:52:44,331 --> 01:52:46,710
So you can believe that
you don't have freewill.

1774
01:52:46,790 --> 01:52:49,190
But of course our decisions
make a difference.

1775
01:52:49,191 --> 01:52:54,170
Like if I just for the rest of the month
old lay here on this couch, you know,

1776
01:52:54,200 --> 01:52:57,200
my life would, would fall
apart. I realize that.

1777
01:52:57,230 --> 01:53:00,650
So I'm not saying our
decisions make a difference.

1778
01:53:00,680 --> 01:53:05,660
It's just those decisions are
predetermined. That's a big subject.

1779
01:53:06,200 --> 01:53:10,610
Uh Oh and I did have, wait, what was
the other one that I wanted to bring up?

1780
01:53:10,850 --> 01:53:15,080
Shoot, it'll come back to it and go
back to it. Oh well the last one,

1781
01:53:15,260 --> 01:53:16,740
which is multi versus a,

1782
01:53:16,741 --> 01:53:20,360
I know a lot of physicists
believe in multi verses and,

1783
01:53:20,390 --> 01:53:25,390
but it really hit me with this election
cycle because it is so like I can see at

1784
01:53:27,801 --> 01:53:31,700
the convention of of universes
all of the multiverse is an ICC.

1785
01:53:31,700 --> 01:53:36,680
Our Universe is going to be like
getting just ton of crap. Like guys,

1786
01:53:36,681 --> 01:53:40,130
this is the universe where
Donald Trump is president.

1787
01:53:40,160 --> 01:53:42,730
Like can you believe that we'd be like,

1788
01:53:43,540 --> 01:53:46,220
if the multiverse is actually
collection of kids in school,

1789
01:53:46,221 --> 01:53:50,420
you're saying that we're
going to be taunted? I think
so. I do believe that. Uh,

1790
01:53:50,450 --> 01:53:55,160
so yeah, that's what I've been
thinking about recently. What books,

1791
01:53:55,790 --> 01:54:00,230
what book or books have you gifted the
most to other people besides your own? Uh,

1792
01:54:00,710 --> 01:54:04,790
I would say, I can't remember whether you
had them on as a gas, but Jonathan Heit,

1793
01:54:05,210 --> 01:54:08,060
I have not heard him on as a guest.
He's a great writer.

1794
01:54:08,180 --> 01:54:11,060
How do you spell his last
name? H. A. I. D. T and I,

1795
01:54:11,061 --> 01:54:13,580
maybe he's come up a few times
in conversation with friends.

1796
01:54:13,581 --> 01:54:15,230
Recently did a great ted talk.

1797
01:54:15,231 --> 01:54:19,730
He wrote a book called the righteous
mind and it's all about trying to figure

1798
01:54:19,731 --> 01:54:23,210
out the,
the gap between the red and blue states,

1799
01:54:23,240 --> 01:54:26,330
Republican and Democrat.
And it's really interesting.

1800
01:54:26,960 --> 01:54:29,090
And he likens it to almost taste buds.

1801
01:54:29,120 --> 01:54:33,890
Like Republicans have different moral
tastes buds than Democrats. And,

1802
01:54:33,891 --> 01:54:34,580
uh,

1803
01:54:34,580 --> 01:54:38,570
I think the righteous mind may have been
recommended to me by a neuroscientist

1804
01:54:38,870 --> 01:54:42,710
about a year ago,
a phd in neuroscience.

1805
01:54:43,280 --> 01:54:45,710
So the righteous mind,
uh,

1806
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:52,000
what purchase of $100 or less has most
positively impacted your life in recent

1807
01:54:52,041 --> 01:54:54,500
memory? Is a good question. Uh,

1808
01:54:55,160 --> 01:55:00,080
well one thing I do love the, my
elastic shoe laces and my, uh,

1809
01:55:00,380 --> 01:55:02,630
do you use those? No, I
like this idea though.

1810
01:55:02,720 --> 01:55:07,720
I was just fussing with
shoelaces yesterday and got
so fed up that I went and

1811
01:55:07,851 --> 01:55:12,020
found a different pair of shoes that
I had packed, uh, which you know,

1812
01:55:12,021 --> 01:55:15,830
if she likes it. So elastic shoe
laces. Yeah. So you just replace the,

1813
01:55:15,831 --> 01:55:18,890
the cloth shoe laces with these,
alas,

1814
01:55:18,920 --> 01:55:21,680
I think it's called lace
lock is of the brand I use.

1815
01:55:22,490 --> 01:55:25,580
And yet lay shoe laces
seem like such like 19th,

1816
01:55:25,581 --> 01:55:29,660
18th century technology. It's
so crazy. We still use them.

1817
01:55:30,290 --> 01:55:34,670
And these ones you just slip them
on and they, they, for me at least,

1818
01:55:34,671 --> 01:55:38,630
they're just as tight and uh,
and secure.

1819
01:55:39,080 --> 01:55:43,590
And also they're also not as sort of
mental institution is like velcro shoes.

1820
01:55:44,070 --> 01:55:47,640
You don't have to make the jump to Velcro,
you can go in between with the

1821
01:55:47,710 --> 01:55:51,700
right. Yeah, the velcro. If you're
under seven or like over 80,

1822
01:55:51,701 --> 01:55:55,870
you can get away with velcro.
But in between it's hard.

1823
01:55:57,460 --> 01:56:01,850
Uh, do you have any
particular morning rituals?

1824
01:56:02,660 --> 01:56:07,660
Anything that is particularly
important to you that is not obvious?

1825
01:56:07,761 --> 01:56:08,061
Like,
yes,

1826
01:56:08,061 --> 01:56:12,650
you want to keep your kids alive and
I'm imagining feed them in some form and

1827
01:56:12,651 --> 01:56:14,090
fashion,
but as a,

1828
01:56:14,100 --> 01:56:17,120
are there any other morning routines
or rituals that are important for you?

1829
01:56:17,320 --> 01:56:20,770
Well, one we talked about is sort
of the, the mental calisthenics.

1830
01:56:20,771 --> 01:56:24,220
I find that helpful.
Another you talk about in your books,

1831
01:56:24,221 --> 01:56:28,090
which is the sort of restricting
information, information diets.

1832
01:56:28,450 --> 01:56:33,450
And I have tried sometimes successfully
to stop reading the newspaper or any

1833
01:56:34,961 --> 01:56:37,720
news in the morning because,
you know,

1834
01:56:37,721 --> 01:56:40,790
then I just get depressed and spiral.
Uh,

1835
01:56:40,840 --> 01:56:44,510
I find it good to read news right before
I go to bed cause then I get depressed

1836
01:56:44,530 --> 01:56:49,150
and I'm able to fall
asleep. So, uh, that for me,

1837
01:56:49,390 --> 01:56:54,340
keeping your mind clear away from
news in the morning is, is crucial.

1838
01:56:56,030 --> 01:57:00,210
Uh, if you were to give a Ted talk
on something you are not known for,

1839
01:57:00,270 --> 01:57:01,500
so you've given a lot of talks,

1840
01:57:01,501 --> 01:57:04,650
but something that you are not
associated with or known for whatsoever,

1841
01:57:05,540 --> 01:57:10,150
what would it be on? Oh,
that's a good one. That's a
good one. I, um, let me think.

1842
01:57:11,100 --> 01:57:12,870
Uh,
I don't know if this might be repetitive,

1843
01:57:12,871 --> 01:57:17,250
but just talking about all
of the horrible, the ways
that the past is horrible.

1844
01:57:17,340 --> 01:57:21,030
I think I could go on for like, I know you
only have 20 minutes of, or a Ted talk,

1845
01:57:21,031 --> 01:57:22,830
but I could go on for like four hours.

1846
01:57:24,540 --> 01:57:29,320
Uh, do you have any, anything,
is there anything that you, uh,

1847
01:57:29,740 --> 01:57:33,190
obsess on or over on the
evenings or weekends?

1848
01:57:33,400 --> 01:57:37,660
It's just something I got a
pet obsession of yours that is,

1849
01:57:37,661 --> 01:57:39,010
that you have not talked about.

1850
01:57:39,790 --> 01:57:43,780
Let's see. I mean, yes,
I'm sure I'm, I'm a,

1851
01:57:43,810 --> 01:57:47,710
a slightly obsessive
person as are you. So, um,

1852
01:57:48,210 --> 01:57:51,310
yeah, slightly, it's slightly, is
very generous in my case at least.

1853
01:57:52,140 --> 01:57:56,620
Uh, I, I'm trying to think.
I would say, I guess,

1854
01:57:57,920 --> 01:58:02,040
uh, that I'm, I do have
the fear of missing out,

1855
01:58:02,041 --> 01:58:05,010
not on parties, but on ideas. Like I am,

1856
01:58:05,100 --> 01:58:07,440
I'm always nervous like that.

1857
01:58:07,441 --> 01:58:12,441
I haven't read enough and that there's
great ideas and I'm just willfully

1858
01:58:12,691 --> 01:58:17,260
ignorant. Uh, so, so
that's, I guess something.

1859
01:58:19,370 --> 01:58:23,730
You read the newspaper before you go to
bed, exit breast and Wallah that then, uh,

1860
01:58:24,440 --> 01:58:28,880
if you think about bad advice, what is,

1861
01:58:28,970 --> 01:58:33,970
what is some bad advice that you
hear given out often in your world?

1862
01:58:34,071 --> 01:58:37,130
And you can define that any way you
want. It could be writing, could be,

1863
01:58:37,270 --> 01:58:41,980
I do have one, I have one that's like a
pet peeve of mine, which is be yourself,

1864
01:58:42,320 --> 01:58:46,480
uh, because you know what,
if yourself is an asshole,

1865
01:58:46,540 --> 01:58:51,160
like Stalin, he was being himself
just lets down would be stolen.

1866
01:58:51,290 --> 01:58:55,300
That guy was really being
himself. So I think, uh,

1867
01:58:56,080 --> 01:59:00,250
if you think about this a little more,
a little less flippantly,

1868
01:59:00,460 --> 01:59:05,200
I think there are things that are very
deep in us. You know, if you're gay,

1869
01:59:05,201 --> 01:59:09,230
you're gay, don't try to
change that. But there are, uh,

1870
01:59:09,410 --> 01:59:13,280
aspects of our personality
that we think are ingrained,

1871
01:59:13,310 --> 01:59:18,080
but that can be changed.
Like I don't think I'm a very
outgoing person. Naturally.

1872
01:59:18,081 --> 01:59:18,914
I think I,

1873
01:59:18,980 --> 01:59:23,450
I would spend most days
just indoors reading,

1874
01:59:23,810 --> 01:59:27,720
but I forced myself to be social,
uh,

1875
01:59:28,570 --> 01:59:32,110
sort of force myself to be a, um, uh,

1876
01:59:32,400 --> 01:59:36,150
to get out there and it's made my life
better because you interact with people,

1877
01:59:36,151 --> 01:59:40,500
you're happier. So don't
just be yourself, try to,

1878
01:59:40,860 --> 01:59:42,930
you know,
be the best parts of yourself,

1879
01:59:42,960 --> 01:59:45,870
but then take the worst parts of
yourself and try to change those,

1880
01:59:47,130 --> 01:59:48,050
which I think you do.

1881
01:59:48,570 --> 01:59:50,810
No, no, I agree with that.
I agree with that bias.

1882
01:59:50,900 --> 01:59:55,900
And I think there's also be
yourself implies that you're
a finished product in a

1883
01:59:55,911 --> 02:00:00,010
sense to, which is where I take
issue with the [inaudible],

1884
02:00:00,460 --> 02:00:02,920
the obsession with discover yourself,
where

1885
02:00:04,590 --> 02:00:08,670
maybe as a compliment to that at
least maybe even at an alternative,

1886
02:00:08,671 --> 02:00:12,630
the create yourself maybe
in some ways more accurate.

1887
02:00:12,690 --> 02:00:15,840
Even though we think of this
persistent, I, this persistent Tim,

1888
02:00:15,841 --> 02:00:19,170
this persistent Aaj, uh, I mean from,

1889
02:00:19,200 --> 02:00:23,290
from the cells in our body to just
about every other aspect of our being.

1890
02:00:23,320 --> 02:00:26,620
We were constantly in
flux. I love that, uh,

1891
02:00:27,570 --> 02:00:28,500
works in progress.

1892
02:00:28,560 --> 02:00:32,880
So I may not have time to put
this up in the next few weeks,

1893
02:00:33,480 --> 02:00:34,520
but if you get,

1894
02:00:34,521 --> 02:00:38,220
have one gigantic billboard anywhere to
get a message out to millions of people,

1895
02:00:38,250 --> 02:00:42,210
they could not be an advertisement.
Uh, any short message,

1896
02:00:42,490 --> 02:00:45,130
I was thinking about this
cause I know you ask it.

1897
02:00:45,720 --> 02:00:50,340
I mean one thought that occurred to
me is it's something like, you know,

1898
02:00:50,370 --> 02:00:55,370
life is too complicated and subtle and
filled with grace to be summed up on a

1899
02:00:56,071 --> 02:01:00,990
billboard. So don't pay attention to
billboards, something metta like that.

1900
02:01:01,320 --> 02:01:05,280
Um, I did a piece on, on effective
altruism. I know you introduced,

1901
02:01:05,400 --> 02:01:10,170
interviewed McCaskill. Yeah, I
am a fan of that way of thinking.

1902
02:01:10,171 --> 02:01:14,400
Just, you know, how lucky we
are and trying to give back.
So maybe like, you know,

1903
02:01:15,340 --> 02:01:17,280
I is that,
but that would be an advertisement.

1904
02:01:17,340 --> 02:01:19,650
No, not necessarily. I mean
you could have a, you know,

1905
02:01:19,651 --> 02:01:23,070
if you make more than 68 k per year,
you're in the global 1%.

1906
02:01:23,180 --> 02:01:25,570
Yeah. Something like that. Yeah.

1907
02:01:25,790 --> 02:01:30,310
It was interesting cause like
you got to use guilt, um,

1908
02:01:30,740 --> 02:01:35,720
very guilt will only get you so far like
that that might get you in the door.

1909
02:01:35,721 --> 02:01:38,180
But then this feeling of,

1910
02:01:38,181 --> 02:01:43,181
of empowerment of helping others I think
is a better motivator for altruism.

1911
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:45,391
Yeah.

1912
02:01:45,391 --> 02:01:50,391
Well I think it's more if you're looking
to optimize the lifetime value of a

1913
02:01:51,991 --> 02:01:55,980
donor as opposed to a single transaction
that the then resent then yeah.

1914
02:01:56,010 --> 02:01:59,540
Guilt is not the primary tool.
Right. At least it seems that way.

1915
02:01:59,580 --> 02:02:01,750
Just working with a number of nonprofits,
um,

1916
02:02:02,970 --> 02:02:05,340
myself we'll say in educational stuff.

1917
02:02:05,670 --> 02:02:08,670
So I sometimes ask people what advice
they would give their younger self.

1918
02:02:08,671 --> 02:02:11,280
I'm going to pose it a different
way because you have this,

1919
02:02:11,820 --> 02:02:14,160
this aged photo of yourself,
your,

1920
02:02:14,430 --> 02:02:18,240
your 82 year old self in your house.
What,

1921
02:02:18,241 --> 02:02:21,720
what advice do you think your 82 year
old self would give your current self?

1922
02:02:22,370 --> 02:02:27,170
That is a good one. I
like that twist. I think,

1923
02:02:27,440 --> 02:02:29,510
um,
and I tried to do this.

1924
02:02:29,511 --> 02:02:34,370
I think my 82 year old self
hopefully will be wiser and happier.

1925
02:02:34,460 --> 02:02:39,170
I do think overall my level
of happiness has arisen, uh,

1926
02:02:39,710 --> 02:02:43,520
which is nice. Um, so hopefully
trending in the right direction,

1927
02:02:43,850 --> 02:02:47,390
hopefully fingers crossed
that continues. Uh, and I,

1928
02:02:47,410 --> 02:02:51,860
I guess I battled this to
even today is um, uh, don't,

1929
02:02:52,100 --> 02:02:53,840
uh,
don't be so opinionated,

1930
02:02:53,841 --> 02:02:58,841
don't have such strongly held beliefs
that they can't be changed with evidence.

1931
02:03:00,500 --> 02:03:04,220
Uh, you know, I think that
this society is a weird,

1932
02:03:05,180 --> 02:03:10,040
as a weird fetish with a
strongly held beliefs and like,

1933
02:03:10,041 --> 02:03:13,070
you know, these are my deep seated
beliefs and if you change him,

1934
02:03:13,071 --> 02:03:17,060
you're a flip flopper and I, you know,
I think we should got to rebrand.

1935
02:03:17,061 --> 02:03:21,500
Flip flopping is great as long as you're
doing it based on evidence and not on

1936
02:03:21,501 --> 02:03:25,880
whims like you are,
you have the ability to,

1937
02:03:26,290 --> 02:03:29,200
uh, you know, the courage
to change your conviction.

1938
02:03:29,201 --> 02:03:32,420
It's not just the courage
of your convictions, but
the courage to change them.

1939
02:03:32,930 --> 02:03:37,520
So maybe I would tell myself, you know,
work on that part of your personality.

1940
02:03:38,480 --> 02:03:42,380
That's what makes a good scientist
as well now. Exactly right.

1941
02:03:43,550 --> 02:03:45,780
What is [inaudible]

1942
02:03:45,890 --> 02:03:48,710
one of your favorite personal failures?

1943
02:03:49,010 --> 02:03:53,960
What I mean by that is
specifically a failure that

1944
02:03:55,780 --> 02:04:00,780
led in some way to a later success or
set the stage for the later success.

1945
02:04:03,940 --> 02:04:07,330
Well, I have had many, many failures,
have ways as we've discussed.

1946
02:04:07,331 --> 02:04:11,500
And I am a big fan of them. I, uh,
you know, and rejection. I try,

1947
02:04:11,560 --> 02:04:14,440
that's one of the things I try to teach
my kids all the time. Like, you know,

1948
02:04:14,830 --> 02:04:18,760
you're going to get rejected 98% of the
time. He just got to keep going. One,

1949
02:04:18,850 --> 02:04:22,160
I don't know if this falls into
the right category, but I, uh,

1950
02:04:22,240 --> 02:04:26,080
NBC a couple of years ago options my life,

1951
02:04:26,980 --> 02:04:31,040
one of my books and that it
was going to be a comedy, uh,

1952
02:04:31,060 --> 02:04:35,590
where every week it was this writer
did another wacky experiment and chaos

1953
02:04:35,610 --> 02:04:40,270
ensued. Uh, and it was a total
failure. It didn't get picked up.

1954
02:04:41,620 --> 02:04:46,350
What the lesson I learned was I
actually made a conscious effort.

1955
02:04:46,360 --> 02:04:48,770
I was like, you know what, this
may or may not get picked up,

1956
02:04:48,771 --> 02:04:53,771
but I am going to consciously enjoy this
experience and get everything I can out

1957
02:04:54,621 --> 02:04:59,230
of it. Uh, you know, I got to meet Donald
Sutherland, played my father in law.

1958
02:04:59,470 --> 02:05:04,390
Um, my wife was played by this woman
who had much bigger boobs than she did,

1959
02:05:04,391 --> 02:05:08,800
so she loved it
and it was just a blast.

1960
02:05:09,220 --> 02:05:12,640
And I would go into meetings and I would
see, he'd be like, you know what if,

1961
02:05:12,700 --> 02:05:16,720
what if the main character who is
named Aja, what if he did this?

1962
02:05:16,721 --> 02:05:21,540
And they're like, oh, a Jay would never do
that. I'd be like, ah, well I am. I don't,

1963
02:05:21,541 --> 02:05:24,970
maybe he would.
But it was just so much fun.

1964
02:05:24,971 --> 02:05:29,830
And there's one producer who I read
a book of hers and she's like, yeah,

1965
02:05:29,831 --> 02:05:32,290
if you cannot enjoy the process,

1966
02:05:32,830 --> 02:05:36,610
then you're screwed because the chances
of getting a movie actually made are so

1967
02:05:36,611 --> 02:05:41,080
infinitesimal. So enjoy the process,
enjoy the walk up the mountain,

1968
02:05:41,140 --> 02:05:44,170
not just the summit. That
was a, that was a big lesson.

1969
02:05:45,220 --> 02:05:48,340
What's a, if you think
back, can you think of

1970
02:05:50,440 --> 02:05:55,030
the best or one of the best investments
you've ever made? And that could be time,

1971
02:05:55,031 --> 02:05:57,100
energy, money. I'll give you an example.

1972
02:05:57,101 --> 02:06:00,760
So a Amelia Boone three time
world's toughest mudder champion,

1973
02:06:00,761 --> 02:06:05,080
most decorated obstacle course racer
in the world, full time attorney,

1974
02:06:05,081 --> 02:06:06,010
also at Apple.

1975
02:06:06,011 --> 02:06:10,710
But it was her first entrance
fee for one of these races,

1976
02:06:10,920 --> 02:06:15,360
which was I think at the time,
$400, $450, which was a stretch.

1977
02:06:15,361 --> 02:06:17,700
I mean it was a,
a real expenditure for,

1978
02:06:18,470 --> 02:06:22,640
but it opened up this entirely new
career and she not taken that. Who knows?

1979
02:06:23,170 --> 02:06:27,330
Uh, can you kidding? It doesn't have
to be analogous to that, but, uh, he,

1980
02:06:27,360 --> 02:06:31,920
can I go the other way? I have two
ideas. One is about a month ago,

1981
02:06:31,921 --> 02:06:36,921
I wrote an article for Esquire where I
got the most expensive haircut in the

1982
02:06:37,131 --> 02:06:39,920
world in New York City and $800 haircut.

1983
02:06:40,610 --> 02:06:44,680
And it was crazy cause, uh,
you know, as this guy, uh,

1984
02:06:44,860 --> 02:06:48,810
it was on Park Avenue, his name is
Julien Farel and he was very friendly.

1985
02:06:48,811 --> 02:06:52,070
She said, Eric got. Um, and I was like,

1986
02:06:52,810 --> 02:06:55,740
and it was a fascinating
learning experience because
of course it's not worth

1987
02:06:55,741 --> 02:06:58,890
$800. It's like, that's
insane. It's like, you know,

1988
02:06:59,080 --> 02:07:02,140
20% better than my super cuts,
which cost 20 bucks.

1989
02:07:02,590 --> 02:07:06,310
But just learning,
he gets clients,

1990
02:07:06,460 --> 02:07:09,850
he is booked all the time. Like
how does he do this? And you know,

1991
02:07:09,851 --> 02:07:14,720
he's got Goldman Sachs guys who've come
in every week for an $800 haircut and

1992
02:07:14,721 --> 02:07:18,040
it's, it's all about the experience
because the actual cutting,

1993
02:07:18,041 --> 02:07:19,270
it's not that different.
Right.

1994
02:07:19,510 --> 02:07:23,950
But the experience of the Cappuccino
and the music and you know,

1995
02:07:23,951 --> 02:07:26,350
he'll talk to you,
stare,

1996
02:07:26,351 --> 02:07:30,820
you deepen the eyes and talk to you about
what your hair means to you and how it

1997
02:07:30,821 --> 02:07:34,250
can change your life and tough
task ahead of them with me if I go

1998
02:07:36,140 --> 02:07:36,973
maybe,

1999
02:07:36,980 --> 02:07:39,950
although there the lot small remaining
parts I have. Do you mean a lot to them?

2000
02:07:40,140 --> 02:07:44,540
Yeah. So yeah, it was fascinating.
I mean that's how he does it. It's,

2001
02:07:44,970 --> 02:07:47,670
and he'll look at your
skull for like five minutes,

2002
02:07:47,671 --> 02:07:50,970
like an artist like
knowledgist for knowledge.

2003
02:07:51,660 --> 02:07:55,290
So he's able to get clients
by making the experience,

2004
02:07:55,320 --> 02:07:57,600
even though the price
is just so ridiculous.

2005
02:07:57,910 --> 02:08:01,500
Maybe it's because the prices
are ridiculous. That's a
good part of it. Exactly.

2006
02:08:01,740 --> 02:08:06,000
He has just Jack. So anyway,
I thought that was an eye.

2007
02:08:06,120 --> 02:08:09,420
I did not pay for it,
luckily ask why are paid for it.

2008
02:08:09,930 --> 02:08:14,930
So I guess one of my first books was
about reading the Encyclopedia Britannica

2009
02:08:15,420 --> 02:08:20,220
when they still actually printed that
till they were like 40, 33 volumes.

2010
02:08:20,520 --> 02:08:23,570
And uh,
I read them all and that costs,

2011
02:08:23,630 --> 02:08:26,060
that costs $1,500 to buy that set,

2012
02:08:26,840 --> 02:08:30,320
which is an absurd amount for a,
a book,

2013
02:08:30,321 --> 02:08:32,420
but it turned out it paid off.

2014
02:08:32,580 --> 02:08:35,250
So would you say,
was that book

2015
02:08:37,020 --> 02:08:41,190
one of the biggest inflection points
for you as a writer? I mean, did that,

2016
02:08:41,191 --> 02:08:44,180
would you, would, if something
put you on the map as a writer,

2017
02:08:44,700 --> 02:08:48,480
was it that book or was it
an earlier piece where you,

2018
02:08:48,600 --> 02:08:52,310
Saffron Atlee that took it to
a different level. And, uh,

2019
02:08:52,340 --> 02:08:54,390
I had written a couple
of other books before,

2020
02:08:54,391 --> 02:08:57,570
but they were sort of novelty
short books like, you know,

2021
02:08:57,780 --> 02:09:01,830
one was called America offline about
this wonderful world outside of the

2022
02:09:01,831 --> 02:09:06,240
Internet where you can actually meet
people face to face and it's all like four

2023
02:09:06,241 --> 02:09:10,290
copies. I it came out, I think it
was, uh, it, it would probably suck,

2024
02:09:10,291 --> 02:09:14,190
but it's also ahead of its time.
So that probably both play.

2025
02:09:14,520 --> 02:09:19,240
But that I think the key was that that
was the first one with real emotion.

2026
02:09:19,750 --> 02:09:23,650
Uh, and, and, and it's sort
of an emotional arc. And
I talked about my father,

2027
02:09:23,660 --> 02:09:28,020
I talked about the meaning of life and,
and you know,

2028
02:09:28,120 --> 02:09:32,860
little lane way I, I tried but it,
and that connected with people.

2029
02:09:32,890 --> 02:09:35,770
I think emotion really does that.

2030
02:09:35,771 --> 02:09:39,460
And that's one of the big lessons of this
podcast that I'm doing with gimlet is

2031
02:09:39,461 --> 02:09:43,870
like getting those emotional
moments really makes a difference.

2032
02:09:45,370 --> 02:09:50,120
So let's, let's wrap up on
a question directed at you,

2033
02:09:50,121 --> 02:09:54,580
but for the audience of, for
people listening and I'll
certainly tell them, uh,

2034
02:09:54,590 --> 02:09:56,110
we'll have two questions,
but the first one is,

2035
02:09:56,111 --> 02:09:58,730
is not related to where
they can find you and so on,

2036
02:09:58,731 --> 02:10:01,040
which is going to be the last question.
This one is really,

2037
02:10:01,041 --> 02:10:04,880
do you have any suggestions,
recommendations,

2038
02:10:04,881 --> 02:10:06,800
parting thoughts for people listening,

2039
02:10:06,950 --> 02:10:11,060
something they could try or something
that they can just carry with them that

2040
02:10:11,061 --> 02:10:14,540
might be helpful or useful in some,
ah,

2041
02:10:16,120 --> 02:10:20,610
aside from all the brilliant stuff we
talked about for the last two hours, uh,

2042
02:10:20,730 --> 02:10:23,470
it could be one that you want to
underscore. Well, I definitely,

2043
02:10:23,740 --> 02:10:25,690
I think we've both talked about this.

2044
02:10:25,691 --> 02:10:30,691
The idea of experimenting with your life
is so important because I think if you

2045
02:10:33,471 --> 02:10:37,670
do the same, routines are good in some
ways because they automate things.

2046
02:10:37,730 --> 02:10:40,250
So some parts of your
life should be automated,

2047
02:10:40,790 --> 02:10:45,510
but sometimes the routines caused
you to get in a Rut, like the,

2048
02:10:45,740 --> 02:10:49,290
the neurons actually get in a neural rut.
Uh,

2049
02:10:49,310 --> 02:10:54,050
so doing simple tricks to
just shake up your life.

2050
02:10:54,380 --> 02:10:58,850
I've found it incredibly
enriching. I think you have
for sure. Uh, and it can be,

2051
02:10:58,851 --> 02:11:02,480
as I said, it could be just
trying a different toothpaste
every month. You know,

2052
02:11:02,510 --> 02:11:03,440
there's millions of to,

2053
02:11:03,441 --> 02:11:08,441
I used crest for like 28 years because
some kid at my camp use crest and I

2054
02:11:10,631 --> 02:11:13,300
thought he was cool. So I kept
buying it and like, you know,

2055
02:11:13,301 --> 02:11:17,830
I actually don't like it. I don't like
what it took me 28 years. I mean like,

2056
02:11:17,831 --> 02:11:21,290
you know what, let me
try some other stuff. And

2057
02:11:21,720 --> 02:11:25,770
you said also, I think this is worth
repeating and I'm paraphrasing here,

2058
02:11:25,771 --> 02:11:30,180
but it's often easier to act your way
into thinking differently as opposed to

2059
02:11:30,181 --> 02:11:31,590
thinking your way into acting differently.

2060
02:11:31,670 --> 02:11:35,330
Totally. Yeah. And the, yeah, the
quote is, which is not mine, but yeah,

2061
02:11:35,331 --> 02:11:39,410
it's easier to act your way into a new
way of thinking than to think your way

2062
02:11:39,411 --> 02:11:42,020
into a new way of acting.
It. I, I do love that.

2063
02:11:43,140 --> 02:11:46,140
Hey Jay, always fun to
hang out. We've had a,

2064
02:11:46,430 --> 02:11:48,710
we've seen each other a little
bit this trip in New York City,

2065
02:11:48,711 --> 02:11:53,270
which has been fun and great.
And where can people find you,

2066
02:11:53,330 --> 02:11:58,330

Hey guys, this is Tim again. Just a
few more things before you take off.

2079
02:12:46,060 --> 02:12:48,760
Number one,
this is five bullet Friday.

2080
02:12:49,030 --> 02:12:52,030
Do you want to get a short email from me?

2081
02:12:52,031 --> 02:12:54,640
Would you enjoy getting a short
email from me every Friday?

2082
02:12:54,880 --> 02:12:59,140
That provides a little more soul of
fun before the weekend and five bullet

2083
02:12:59,260 --> 02:12:59,490
Fridays,

2084
02:12:59,490 --> 02:13:04,060
a very short email where
I share the coolest things
I've found or that I've been

2085
02:13:04,061 --> 02:13:05,380
pondering over the week.

2086
02:13:05,590 --> 02:13:08,350
That could include favorite new
albums that I've discovered.

2087
02:13:08,351 --> 02:13:11,800
It could include Gizmos and gadgets
and all sorts of weird shit that I've

2088
02:13:11,801 --> 02:13:16,150
somehow dug up in the uh,
the world of the esoteric as I do.

2089
02:13:16,390 --> 02:13:21,390
It could include favorite articles that
I've read and that I've shared with my

2090
02:13:22,090 --> 02:13:24,790
close friends for instance.
And it's very short.

2091
02:13:24,850 --> 02:13:29,830

2100
02:13:56,220 --> 02:13:59,670
I used 99 designs to get book cover
prototypes for the four hour body,

2111
02:14:35,820 --> 02:14:39,870
This episode is brought to
you by Wealthfront and this
is a very unique sponsor.

2112
02:14:40,290 --> 02:14:44,670
Wealthfront is a massively disruptive
in a good way, set it and forget it.

2113
02:14:44,671 --> 02:14:49,020
Investing service led by technologists
from places like apple and world famous

2114
02:14:49,021 --> 02:14:49,800
investors.

2115
02:14:49,800 --> 02:14:53,490
It has exploded in popularity in the last
two years and they now have more than

2116
02:14:53,491 --> 02:14:56,490
two and a half billion dollars
under management. In fact,

2117
02:14:56,520 --> 02:14:57,870
some of my very good friends,

2118
02:14:57,900 --> 02:15:01,050
investors in silicon valley have millions
of their own money in Wealthfront.

2119
02:15:01,390 --> 02:15:04,110
So the question is why? Why is
it so popular? Why is it unique?

2120
02:15:04,410 --> 02:15:08,430
Because you can get services previously
reserved for the ultra wealthy but only

2121
02:15:08,431 --> 02:15:10,380
pay pennies on the dollar for them.

2122
02:15:10,920 --> 02:15:14,130
And this is because they use smarter
software instead of retail locations,

2123
02:15:14,131 --> 02:15:16,890
bloated sales teams, et cetera. And
I'll come back to that in a second.

2124
02:15:17,400 --> 02:15:22,050
I suggest you check out wealthfront.com
forward slash Tim take the risk

2125
02:15:22,051 --> 02:15:22,771
assessment quiz,

2126
02:15:22,771 --> 02:15:26,700
which only takes two to five minutes and
they'll show you for free exactly the

2127
02:15:26,701 --> 02:15:29,640
portfolio they'd put you in.
And if you just want to take their advice,

2128
02:15:29,850 --> 02:15:33,030
run with it, do it yourself.
You can do that or as I would,

2129
02:15:33,031 --> 02:15:34,890
you can set it and forget it.
And here's why.

2130
02:15:35,220 --> 02:15:39,210
The value of Wealthfront is in the
automation of habits and strategies that

2131
02:15:39,211 --> 02:15:42,630
investors should be using on a
regular basis but normally aren't.

2132
02:15:42,990 --> 02:15:45,300
Great investing is a marathon,
not a sprint,

2133
02:15:45,360 --> 02:15:48,990
and little things that you may or may
not be familiar with like automatic tax

2134
02:15:48,991 --> 02:15:51,120
loss harvesting,
rebalancing your portfolio,

2135
02:15:51,270 --> 02:15:55,620
cross more than 10 asset classes and
dividend reinvestment add up to very large

2136
02:15:55,621 --> 02:15:59,340
amounts of money over longer periods
of time. Wealthfront, as I mentioned,

2137
02:15:59,341 --> 02:16:01,950
since it's using software
instead of retail locations,

2138
02:16:01,951 --> 02:16:06,120
etc. Can offer all of this at low
costs that were previously completely

2139
02:16:06,121 --> 02:16:07,650
impossible right off the bat,

2140
02:16:07,800 --> 02:16:10,170
you never pay commissions or
account fees for everything.

2141
02:16:10,171 --> 02:16:15,171
They charge 0.25% per year on assets above
the first 15,000 which is managed for

2142
02:16:15,811 --> 02:16:17,850
free.
If you use my link,

2143
02:16:17,880 --> 02:16:22,200
wealthfront.com forward slash Tim that
is less than $5 a month to invest a

2144
02:16:22,201 --> 02:16:24,630
$30,000 account for instance.
Now,

2145
02:16:24,631 --> 02:16:28,170
normally when I have a sponsor on this
show is because I use them and recommend

2146
02:16:28,171 --> 02:16:29,830
them. In this case,
it's a little different.

2147
02:16:30,130 --> 02:16:34,090
I don't use wealth front yet because
I'm not allowed to. Here's the deal.

2148
02:16:34,360 --> 02:16:38,350
They wanted to sponsor this podcast,
but because of sec regulations,

2149
02:16:38,560 --> 02:16:42,040
companies that invest your money are
not allowed to use client testimonials.

2150
02:16:42,041 --> 02:16:44,860
So I couldn't be a user end
have them on the podcast,

2151
02:16:45,340 --> 02:16:48,970
but I've been so impressed by Wealthfront
that I've invested a significant

2152
02:16:48,971 --> 02:16:52,780
amount of my own money, at least for me,
uh, in the team and the company itself.

2153
02:16:52,840 --> 02:16:55,900
So I am an investor and hope
to soon use it as a client.

2154
02:16:56,110 --> 02:16:59,470
Now back to the recommendation
as a Tim Ferriss show listener,

2155
02:16:59,530 --> 02:17:03,310
you'll get $15,000 managed for free
if you decide to open an account.

2156
02:17:03,730 --> 02:17:06,340
But just start with seeing the portfolio
that they would suggest for you.

2157
02:17:06,400 --> 02:17:07,211
Take two minutes,

2158
02:17:07,211 --> 02:17:11,890
fill out their
questionnaire@wealthfront.com
slash Tim it's fast, it's free.

2159
02:17:12,340 --> 02:17:13,660
There's no downside that I can think of.
