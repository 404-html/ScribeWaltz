1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,820
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02,821 --> 00:00:06,140
I can run flat out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:13,530
I'm a cybernetic organism.

4
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,380
This episode is brought to you by wealth
front and this is a very unique sponsor.

5
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,180
Wealthfront is a massively disruptive
in a good way, set it and forget it.

6
00:00:32,181 --> 00:00:36,530
Investing service led by technologists
from places like apple and world famous

7
00:00:36,531 --> 00:00:37,280
investors.

8
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,000
It has exploded in popularity in the last
two years and they now have more than

9
00:00:41,001 --> 00:00:44,000
two and a half billion dollars
under management. In fact,

10
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:45,350
some of my very good friends,

11
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:48,560
investors in silicon valley have millions
of their own money in Wealthfront.

12
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,650
So the question is why? Why is
it so popular? Why is it unique?

13
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,940
Because you can get services previously
reserved for the ultra wealthy but only

14
00:00:55,941 --> 00:00:57,920
pay pennies on the dollar for them,

15
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,640
and this is because they use smarter
software instead of retail locations,

16
00:01:01,641 --> 00:01:04,370
bloated sales teams, et cetera. And
I'll come back to that in a second.

17
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:09,560
I suggest you check out wealthfront.com
forward slash Tim take the risk

18
00:01:09,561 --> 00:01:12,800
assessment quiz which only takes two to
five minutes and they'll show you for

19
00:01:12,801 --> 00:01:16,610
free exactly the portfolio they'd put
you in and if you just want to take their

20
00:01:16,611 --> 00:01:20,540
advice, run with it, do it yourself.
You can do that or as I would,

21
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:22,430
you can set it and
forget it and here's why.

22
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:26,720
The value of Wealthfront is in the
automation of habits and strategies that

23
00:01:26,721 --> 00:01:31,190
investors should be using on a regular
basis but normally aren't great investing

24
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:32,810
is a marathon,
not a sprint,

25
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:36,500
and little things that you may or may
not be familiar with like automatic tax

26
00:01:36,501 --> 00:01:38,630
loss harvesting,
rebalancing your portfolio,

27
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:43,130
cross more than 10 asset classes and
dividend reinvestment add up to very large

28
00:01:43,131 --> 00:01:46,820
amounts of money over longer periods
of time. Wealthfront, as I mentioned,

29
00:01:46,821 --> 00:01:49,460
since it's using software
instead of retail locations,

30
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:53,630
etc. Can offer all of this at low
costs that were previously completely

31
00:01:53,631 --> 00:01:55,130
impossible right off the bat,

32
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:57,650
you never pay commissions or
account fees for everything.

33
00:01:57,651 --> 00:02:02,651
They charge 0.25% per year on assets above
the first 15,000 which is managed for

34
00:02:03,321 --> 00:02:07,010
free. If you use my link,
wealthfront.com forward slash Tim,

35
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,140
that is less than $5 a month to invest
a $30,000 account for instance. Now,

36
00:02:12,141 --> 00:02:15,680
normally when I have a sponsor on the
shows because I use them and recommend

37
00:02:15,681 --> 00:02:17,330
them, in this case,
it's a little different.

38
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,610
I don't use wealth front yet because
I'm not allowed to. Here's the deal.

39
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:25,870
They wanted to sponsor this podcast,
but because of SCC regulations,

40
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,560
companies that invest your money are
not allowed to use client testimonials.

41
00:02:29,561 --> 00:02:32,380
So I couldn't be a user end
have them on the podcast,

42
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:36,460
but I've been so impressed by Wealthfront
that I've invested a significant

43
00:02:36,461 --> 00:02:40,330
amount of my own money, at least for me,
uh, in the team and the company itself.

44
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,450
So I am an investor and hope
to soon use it as a client.

45
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,960
Now back to the recommendation
as a Tim Ferriss show listener,

46
00:02:46,961 --> 00:02:50,830
you'll get $15,000 managed for free
if you decide to open an account.

47
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,860
But just start with seeing the portfolio
that they would suggest for you.

downside that I can think of.

50
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,600
Just take a look, see what
portfolio they would create for you,

51
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,580

Hello boys and girls.

68
00:04:02,781 --> 00:04:05,900
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another
episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

69
00:04:05,901 --> 00:04:10,460
each episode it is my job to deconstruct
world class performers to tease out the

70
00:04:10,461 --> 00:04:13,070
habits, routines, favorite books, serials,

71
00:04:13,071 --> 00:04:16,250
whatever it might be that you can
test and apply in your own life.

72
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:21,610
And this episode is an interview you've
been asking for since before I started

73
00:04:21,621 --> 00:04:23,900
the podcast,
Morgan Spurlock.

74
00:04:23,901 --> 00:04:28,901
He would also have been on my top 10 dream
list when I was drafting up potential

75
00:04:29,511 --> 00:04:31,670
guests for this podcast.
In the very beginning,

76
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:36,410
Morgan Spurlock at Morgan Spurlock on
Twitter is an Oscar nominated documentary

77
00:04:36,411 --> 00:04:39,890
filmmaker based in New York, which is
where we did this interview in his office.

78
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:44,480
He is a prolific writer,
director, producer, and Human
Guinea pig. His first film,

79
00:04:44,481 --> 00:04:46,550
which many of you will know,
supersize me,

80
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:50,300
premiered at the Sundance Film Festival
in 2004 winning best directing honors.

81
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,660
The film went on to win the writer's
guild of America best documentary

82
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,370
screenplay as well as Garner and Academy
Award Nomination for best feature

83
00:04:58,371 --> 00:05:00,140
documentary. Since then, he's directed,

84
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,960
produced and distributed
a ton multiple film,

85
00:05:02,961 --> 00:05:06,530
TV and digital projects
including some that I love,

86
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:11,240
arguably even more than supersize me
and I enjoyed that movie a ton including

87
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,050
the CNN series, Morgan Spurlock
inside man, the FX series,

88
00:05:15,051 --> 00:05:18,290
30 days and the films were in
the world is a song of bin Laden,

89
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,950
confessions of a superhero freakonomics.
The greatest movie ever sold,

90
00:05:21,951 --> 00:05:25,730
which you talk about quite a bit in
this podcast and many, many others.

91
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,390
Morgan's latest project is a
tech startup called collect,

92
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,570
c l e c t.com.
Check it out.

93
00:05:32,571 --> 00:05:37,571
CLE CT like collect c l e c t.com
which is a community for high spending

94
00:05:38,781 --> 00:05:42,920
collectors with a onestop
marketplace where people can browse,

95
00:05:42,921 --> 00:05:46,400
sell and buy collectibles of any type
imaginable. And for a nerd like me,

96
00:05:46,401 --> 00:05:49,640
this is just heaven,
Star Wars, smurfs comics,

97
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:54,440
a Millennium Falcon made from motorcycle
parts is one actual real example.

98
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,131
If you go to the website,

99
00:05:55,131 --> 00:05:59,900
you can see that imagine comic con
Pinterest and Ebay with a lot more thrown

100
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:04,700
into the mix and as someone who owns
10,000 poly bagged cardboard back to comic

101
00:06:04,701 --> 00:06:06,290
books at home.
Yes,

102
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:11,180
I am a Dork and this episode we cover a
ton and I wanted to ask Morgan many of

103
00:06:11,181 --> 00:06:14,810
these questions for years we talk about
how Morgan got his biggest breaks and in

104
00:06:14,811 --> 00:06:16,220
some cases made his own luck.

105
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:19,250
We talk about tips for aspiring
creators and filmmakers,

106
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:22,010
how to get people to care
about important issues.

107
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:26,930
That is a very tough needle to thread.
Favorite books, documentaries, movies,

108
00:06:26,931 --> 00:06:31,400
et cetera. Morgan's thoughts on the
future of media and storytelling and much,

109
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:34,790
much more.
Before I recorded this episode,

110
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:39,791
I threw up on Facebook and Twitter
a request for questions for Morgan.

111
00:06:39,831 --> 00:06:43,490
And there were two links that popped
up a couple of times that I wanted to

112
00:06:43,491 --> 00:06:47,450
address because it underscores a
scientific literacy problem that I want to

113
00:06:47,451 --> 00:06:49,340
highlight.
So everyone listening,

114
00:06:49,341 --> 00:06:53,780
if you haven't read bad science
by Ben Goldacre or the Appendices,

115
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:57,250
which are an excerpt from that in the
four hour body, you should read these. Uh,

116
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,610
because a number of
folks asked, well, why a,

117
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:05,210
are there particular articles that have
trouble replicating the results that

118
00:07:05,211 --> 00:07:07,640
Morgan had in supersize me?
The first one,

119
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:12,590
which is related to a teacher who lost
61 pounds using caloric restriction,

120
00:07:12,591 --> 00:07:15,380
but with junk food,
losing weight does not apply.

121
00:07:15,381 --> 00:07:19,400
It is fundamentally completely a different
protocol so that you can just dismiss

122
00:07:19,401 --> 00:07:20,234
out of hand.

123
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:25,300
And then the second one was related to
a study by Frederick Nystrom in Sweden.

124
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:32,560
And the article that was most often cited
was actually preliminary data and the

125
00:07:33,201 --> 00:07:35,000
preliminary data,
as it turns out,

126
00:07:35,001 --> 00:07:38,450
just like with split testing ended
up getting flipped in a lot of ways.

127
00:07:38,451 --> 00:07:39,590
When it got to the final results,

128
00:07:39,591 --> 00:07:44,591
which I tracked down and ultimately the
results are as follows and this is from

129
00:07:45,141 --> 00:07:47,520
Skyler tanner.com but uh,

130
00:07:47,521 --> 00:07:51,350
it is a reprint effectively
others suffered almost as
much as Spurlock with one

131
00:07:51,351 --> 00:07:55,160
volunteer taking barely two weeks to
reach the maximum 15% weight gain a lot by

132
00:07:55,161 --> 00:07:56,930
the ethics committee that
had approved the study.

133
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:01,550
And it goes on to say that these results
are highly individualized and this was

134
00:08:01,551 --> 00:08:06,530
a study that allowed exercise and I
should highlight that as not what Morgan

135
00:08:06,531 --> 00:08:07,041
did.
So again,

136
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:12,041
you need to be basically scientifically
literate to assess when the media spins

137
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:16,730
studies to serve their own interests
in the form of a headline very often.

138
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:20,060
So I feel very comfortable supersize me
at this point and there are some people

139
00:08:20,061 --> 00:08:23,210
who said it's impossible to eat 5,000
calories a day. I would beg to differ.

140
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,550
You can eat a lot more
than that on a daily basis.

141
00:08:25,551 --> 00:08:29,210
You could read the four hour body for
more on that. With all of that said,

142
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:33,050
please enjoy my wide ranging
conversation with Morgan Spurlock.

143
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,530
Morgan, welcome to the show. Thank
you. I'm stoked to be here. Yeah,

144
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:40,820
I'm really excited to be in your offices.
Finally.

145
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:44,220
I know we've had a couple of lunches,
a couple of dinners over time. Yeah.

146
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,430
And it's nice to see the operation.

147
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,660
And I thought we were talking just before
we started recording about breakfast

148
00:08:50,661 --> 00:08:53,240
and he said, well I don't
usually have breakfast, but
if it's a breakfast meeting,

149
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:56,040
I can't be the guy sitting there
kind of judging the other person.

150
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:59,970
That's right. Do you get that a lot
after supersize me, what happened?

151
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,410
Whenever I'm at a restaurant,

152
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,400
people will walk by and they'll look at
what I'm eating and sometimes they'll

153
00:09:06,401 --> 00:09:09,670
comment and so they'll look at what
I'm eating and though, and you know,

154
00:09:09,671 --> 00:09:11,890
sometimes I'll see what's
on my plate and another time

155
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:15,560
better than Mcdonald's. Right.
And so I get it and I'm like,

156
00:09:15,561 --> 00:09:17,810
it's been 12 years like that.
I'm going to be, that is my,

157
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:21,650
I'm married to that forever. That's your
thing thing. I'm all, I'm okay with that.

158
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,060
I was at the Russian baths yesterday
here just about to pull off the underwear

159
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,090
and uh, there were two fans who
walked up and they're like, Hey,

160
00:09:29,091 --> 00:09:32,780
trying to get four hours where the sauna
in 15 minutes. And I was like, Yup,

161
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:36,140
I kind of deserve that. I guess I'll be
the four hour guy. And definitely, yeah.

162
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:40,650
When somebody asks you, what do
you do, how do you answer that?

163
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,710
I say I'm a storyteller. That's what
I am. I'm a professional storyteller.

164
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:51,720
Where did that first start in
terms of being bitten by the bug?

165
00:09:51,721 --> 00:09:56,721
Was there a particular experience or
mentor who steered you in that direction?

166
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:58,880
Yeah,
I mean I made,

167
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:02,160
my mom was probably the biggest
one when I look back as a kid. Um,

168
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,810
like I loved comic books.

169
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:07,450
I started drawing and writing my own
comic books when I was really young. Um,

170
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,670
just in a notebook like this.

171
00:10:08,671 --> 00:10:11,810
Like I would make the squares draw the
blocks in making your draw the characters

172
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:14,520
tell the stories and uh, and so, yeah,

173
00:10:14,521 --> 00:10:17,010
I mean that was when I was like
maybe eight or nine years old.

174
00:10:17,011 --> 00:10:20,280
My mom was really encouraging of that.
So I think she was probably the first one.

175
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,820
And then at the same time they
were, you know, it was the 70s,

176
00:10:23,821 --> 00:10:26,970
so the parents took you to see things you
should never take kids to see in movie

177
00:10:26,971 --> 00:10:30,660
theaters. We didn't wear helmets on
bikes, we didn't wear seat belts in cars.

178
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:33,540
You pack 10 kids into the back of the
cutlass and took them to baseball to cat,

179
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:35,310
listen to going to baseball practice.
But like,

180
00:10:35,311 --> 00:10:39,360
so my parents would take me to see
movies like jaws, the exorcist,

181
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,880
things you would never take a kid
to see today. It's this, this,

182
00:10:41,881 --> 00:10:45,720
this wrong in so many levels. But um,
so they were taking me see these movies,

183
00:10:45,721 --> 00:10:48,180
but these were the movies that
made me want to make movies.

184
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:50,820
Like I loved horror films.
And so like the movie scanners,

185
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:54,060
like when that guy's had
exploded in scanners, that
was the moment where I said,

186
00:10:54,061 --> 00:10:56,580
I have to do that,
whatever that is now.

187
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,910
What was it about the head
explosion was just the shock value,

188
00:10:59,911 --> 00:11:03,270
the ability to grab someone's attention
and just the way that it looks like the

189
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,000
for, cause when I was a kid, I
originally wanted to be Rick Baker.

190
00:11:06,001 --> 00:11:09,300
I wanted to be Tom Savini. Like when
I saw American Werewolf in London,

191
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:10,850
I mean it blew my mind what great,

192
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,350
it's a great movie and
what the effects did then.

193
00:11:13,351 --> 00:11:16,620
And these were all practical effects
from his hand growing to a snout growing.

194
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,840
Um, there was no CGI,
it was all, they was,

195
00:11:18,841 --> 00:11:21,330
all things that somebody made and
created and figured out how to do.

196
00:11:21,331 --> 00:11:23,850
So that was kind of the
bug that I had first.

197
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,650
It was kind of wanting
to be in that side of it.

198
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:28,020
And then once I learned you could actually
go to college and learn how to make

199
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:30,840
movies and you know, direct
movies and produce movies, I said,

200
00:11:30,841 --> 00:11:34,200
well that's the path I want to go on.
So you went to film school? I went to,

201
00:11:34,201 --> 00:11:36,230
I went to film school first at,
at Ua.

202
00:11:36,231 --> 00:11:38,700
I tried to get into USC
film school and I applied.

203
00:11:38,701 --> 00:11:42,990
I got into the broadcast
journalism school, this was
like in 1989. And so I said,

204
00:11:42,991 --> 00:11:45,760
well, I'll go to USC, I'll go there.
Cause like if you're going to make moves,

205
00:11:45,761 --> 00:11:47,760
you've got to go to California,
you got to go to Hollywood.

206
00:11:47,761 --> 00:11:50,580
And I grew up in West Virginia and so
Hollywood was a million miles away.

207
00:11:50,581 --> 00:11:54,070
Good wrestling state, good rest,
exact rates. They for wrestling, even,

208
00:11:54,071 --> 00:11:57,700
especially when they're not family
members. But, um, so I went,

209
00:11:57,701 --> 00:12:00,610
so I went to Hollywood because I
said this is where I have to be.

210
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:04,270
And so every semester I would apply to
film school at USC and every semester I

211
00:12:04,271 --> 00:12:07,090
would get rejected from film school
at USC, I applied five times.

212
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:10,460
I still have all the rejection letters.
I keep them all. I kept them all. Um,

213
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:11,830
and so finally,
the fifth time I was like,

214
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:14,800
I can't keep putting all
my eggs in this USC basket.

215
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,600
And I was so stupid at the time.

216
00:12:16,601 --> 00:12:19,180
Like I wouldn't apply to
UCLA just out of principle,

217
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:24,190
which is so dumb when you think about
it because UCLA is in such a better part

218
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:27,730
of town. It's such a more beautiful
cancer. You just adopted the rivalry.

219
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,400
Israel already, like I was a Trojan
through and through. I was like,

220
00:12:30,401 --> 00:12:32,860
I'm not going to go to UCLA. I'm not
getting even apply to their film school.

221
00:12:32,861 --> 00:12:36,520
So I applied to Nyu and I got into Nyu
and so I moved to New York and New York

222
00:12:36,521 --> 00:12:39,160
is so much better for me as a person.
I think,

223
00:12:39,161 --> 00:12:42,630
I think it suits my personality much more.
Not to mention my skin tone because I,

224
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:46,450
I'm spectacularly Pale over, but we're
both on the tail end of the spectrum.

225
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:49,860
How did it fit your personality? I
see. I think that I grew up in a,

226
00:12:49,861 --> 00:12:54,160
in a place and in a family and are in a
culture were you mean what you say and

227
00:12:54,161 --> 00:12:56,980
you say what you mean.
And that's kind of how I was brought up.

228
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:00,850
And I think that New York is
very much a city that, you know,

229
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:04,030
says what it says and means what it
says and we'll tell you to your face,

230
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,790
you know, it will stab you right in
the chest and tell you like, you suck.

231
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:09,910
And here's why. And his word, what we
don't like about you and what you do.

232
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,620
Whereas in a, you know, Los Angeles,

233
00:13:11,621 --> 00:13:16,270
it's the inverse yet is the university
in la at least we'll actually sit in New

234
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,740
York rather if it's about money,

235
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,860
you'd know how to interact with
someone and if they're blunt,

236
00:13:20,861 --> 00:13:24,220
it might be a brace of beliefs. It saves
you time and you know where you stand.

237
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,370
At least.
I know from the,

238
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,820
I know from minute one where I stand
with somebody in New York City,

239
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,250
whereas in La you talked to somebody and
the whole time they're talking to you,

240
00:13:30,251 --> 00:13:33,160
they're like looking over your shoulder
to see who more important or more

241
00:13:33,161 --> 00:13:36,820
interesting might be coming into the
room. That's so disconcerting. Yeah.

242
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:39,370
Like life first futures to La. I was
like, well, what is happening right now?

243
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:43,430
Like somebody else here. What
about, what about me? I got here,

244
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:48,220
uh,
the experience in film school.

245
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:52,840
What were the most important lessons
that you learned in film schools? Well,

246
00:13:52,841 --> 00:13:56,530
the cool thing was, I mean it didn't want
you, when I was at film school, there is,

247
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:57,910
it taught you the hustle.

248
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:01,000
Like the thing about Nyu is you had to
raise your own money for your movies.

249
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,660
You had to, you had defined by Hook
or by crook anyway to make the film.

250
00:14:04,661 --> 00:14:05,291
So I mean that was,

251
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:09,040
it was so realistic and I mean it was a
much more independent mindset I think of

252
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:12,340
preparing you for life after film school.
Whereas at USC,

253
00:14:12,341 --> 00:14:13,570
like if you were in film school there,

254
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,150
they paid for your movies and your
pendant. Bird. Yeah. And they,

255
00:14:16,151 --> 00:14:18,850
and they own your movies
like so he basically USC
pays for your films then they

256
00:14:18,851 --> 00:14:22,840
own the films. I had no idea. Yeah. Um,
cause it's kind of part of their legacy.

257
00:14:22,841 --> 00:14:24,820
Like people who go through the
directing program, we pay for the films,

258
00:14:24,821 --> 00:14:28,260
but now we own Ron Howard's movie,
his student film forever. Um,

259
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:32,740
so I think for me it prepared me
much more for what was coming next,

260
00:14:32,741 --> 00:14:35,500
which was the hustle. You know, what,
what you have to do when you get out.

261
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,400
What was your first, uh, in your mind?

262
00:14:39,401 --> 00:14:42,880
Major project after film school?
Um,

263
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:46,150
what was my first major project
after film school? I mean,

264
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,920
and by major I mean in your own mind and
my mind, I tell you that. Here's what,

265
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:52,670
well, there's, there's an interesting that
it had happened to me after school. So,

266
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,170
um,
I got a job,

267
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:58,490
my first job was being a PA on the
professional at the Lucas on film.

268
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:01,970
And so it's a pretty sweet gig. It was
a pretty sweet gig. And so here I was,

269
00:15:01,971 --> 00:15:05,390
I was 22,
23 years old and it was awesome.

270
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:08,390
Like it was so exciting to get to be
on this movie and kind of see him.

271
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:11,690
And so I was kind of Schlepping, you
know, being a PA for the next three,

272
00:15:11,691 --> 00:15:14,060
two to three years working
on any movie I could get on.

273
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,680
So I was a pa on that
movie and then I was on,

274
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:19,000
I worked on woody Allen's
bullets over Broadway and, um,

275
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:23,390
barbay Schroeder's kiss of death.
And so it was on kiss of death where,

276
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:26,870
um, I got offered a job. I've
got a friend of mine, a job,

277
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,690
a girl named Sarah Casper, who
I'm, I went to film school,

278
00:15:29,691 --> 00:15:31,160
which she produced my senior thesis film.

279
00:15:31,161 --> 00:15:32,950
It's one of those things where you get
out of film school, you finish your thing,

280
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,310
your senior thesis film,
you're like,

281
00:15:34,311 --> 00:15:37,190
now I'm going to send this out to film
festivals and this is going to win all

282
00:15:37,191 --> 00:15:40,910
kinds of awards. Hollywood's going to come
calling, I'm going to get my big movie.

283
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:43,290
And then none of that happened
and nothing, I'm nothing happened.

284
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:46,610
So you convince yourself that I'm going
to finish this thing and everything's

285
00:15:46,611 --> 00:15:48,560
gonna Change and I'm going
to get these big movie deals.

286
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:49,910
And of course none of that happens.
The,

287
00:15:49,911 --> 00:15:54,140
I'm probably 2.01% that happens
to everybody else. It doesn't.

288
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:59,000
Um, and so I got out, you
know, not that didn't happen.

289
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:03,080
So I was like just hustling through you
kind of inching my way up the ladder of,

290
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,450
of production.
And I got a friend of mine,

291
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,430
a job on this movie in
the casting department.

292
00:16:07,431 --> 00:16:10,460
She was working for a woman named Tracy
Moore Maribelle who I to this day,

293
00:16:10,461 --> 00:16:13,250
I look at it as kind of one of my mentors
cause she changed my life completely

294
00:16:13,251 --> 00:16:14,780
by what happened next.
I'm,

295
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:20,020
Sarah was casting for this job for
someone to be the spokesperson for Sony

296
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:23,360
Electronics. She goes, so she goes, yeah.
She goes, I can send anybody in for this.

297
00:16:23,361 --> 00:16:26,060
You should go audition for this job.
And I was like, I don't have an agent.

298
00:16:26,061 --> 00:16:27,560
She goes, I can send
anyone, it doesn't matter.

299
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,980
And so I went downtown to
pick up film from set one day,

300
00:16:30,981 --> 00:16:34,250
dropped it off at technicolor on
my way back to the office. Um,

301
00:16:34,251 --> 00:16:37,940
I ran an audition for this thing and two
weeks later I found out I got the job.

302
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:41,030
And so everybody in the, I was like, oh
my God, that's great. Congratulations.

303
00:16:41,031 --> 00:16:43,790
Here's the bag. See you later. Like,
everybody was so happy. I was sleeping.

304
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:47,780
I was like, good, get out please out. Get
out of this. They get out of this movie.

305
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,850
Um,
and so over the next two and a half years,

306
00:16:49,851 --> 00:16:54,290
I traveled around the country working
for Sony as like this carnival barker on

307
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:57,740
stage like that. So they went to trade
shows, they went to sporting events,

308
00:16:57,741 --> 00:16:59,600
they went to colleges,
you name it.

309
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:02,870
And they were one of the sponsors of the
bud light pro beach volleyball league.

310
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:07,310
Yeah. So it's so it's sorta
like Ron Popeil origins,

311
00:17:07,311 --> 00:17:09,930
like selling Sony from the
state. It's a big, chose this,

312
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:13,250
it was this giant tour truck that
when I first went on the road with it,

313
00:17:13,251 --> 00:17:14,780
it was all about Sony auto sound.

314
00:17:14,781 --> 00:17:17,110
Like Sony had launched this
big car stereo division.

315
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:19,610
So it was all about getting P and I
didn't have to know anything about the

316
00:17:19,611 --> 00:17:21,110
product.
I just had to get people to come over.

317
00:17:21,111 --> 00:17:24,320
And so I would just like on this stage,
say, come on over, check this out, blah,

318
00:17:24,321 --> 00:17:26,630
blah, blah. And people would come up and
toward the truck and look at everything.

319
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,180
And then the next year it
became Sony playstation.

320
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:32,630
Then the next year it became Sony Vio
when they launched their computers.

321
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:36,020
And while I'm on the road with
them, my boss on this, at the time,

322
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:37,370
a guy named David [inaudible] said,

323
00:17:37,371 --> 00:17:39,770
we need to make a video about this
tour and what we're doing. Um,

324
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:42,230
who should we have do that? And I said,
you should have me do that. I said,

325
00:17:42,231 --> 00:17:43,580
I went to film school,
let me make that.

326
00:17:43,581 --> 00:17:45,710
And so I made this film
for them about this.

327
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:48,530
And then I made a bigger film
for Sony about mini disk.

328
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,270
And then I made bigger film
about something else for them.

329
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:54,180
And then probably then my biggest project
that I ever did with them was there

330
00:17:54,181 --> 00:17:58,920
kind of ces, the consumer electronic
show in like 1990 burning man for nerds.

331
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:02,370
It's like burning man for nerds is exactly
what it is, is it's super nerd prom.

332
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,140
And so I made kind of their ces
experience movie where you went into this

333
00:18:07,141 --> 00:18:09,930
theater and I mean they spent
millions of dollars on it.

334
00:18:09,931 --> 00:18:11,460
And it was like the biggest
thing I'd ever done.

335
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,440
So the biggest thing I
did out of film school,

336
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:17,250
the first biggest gigantic thing
I did was that wow. And so,

337
00:18:17,251 --> 00:18:20,420
and it was so like off track of where I
thought my career was going to be going

338
00:18:20,421 --> 00:18:21,600
or what I thought I'd be doing.

339
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:24,900
But little did I know that all of those
things that I was doing were ultimately

340
00:18:24,901 --> 00:18:26,370
putting me on a path where I am now.

341
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:31,200
So this is a theme that recurs a lot in
these interviews with say for instance

342
00:18:31,201 --> 00:18:31,891
Jamie Foxx,

343
00:18:31,891 --> 00:18:35,490
where these things that were seemingly
unrelated to his end destination prepared

344
00:18:35,491 --> 00:18:36,780
and perfectly for it.
Totally.

345
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:41,100
And I was going to ask you a little
later in our conversation about how you

346
00:18:41,101 --> 00:18:45,510
build rapport with people. Yeah.
But let's dig into it right now.

347
00:18:45,511 --> 00:18:50,450
So if I watch say inside man jet
love or a, you know, 30 days. Yeah.

348
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:55,800
I'm consistently impressed with how you
get people to embrace you from different

349
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:59,670
worlds and accept you and trust you.
How did you develop that?

350
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:02,430
Or have you always been
hardwired for that? Oh,

351
00:19:02,431 --> 00:19:06,120
I think the biggest thing you have
to do is, is you just have to listen.

352
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,860
The minute you start listening,

353
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:11,190
it's amazing how people will talk to
you and how people will embrace you.

354
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:14,760
We live in a culture where we don't listen
to begin with. I think that's one. Um,

355
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:17,340
and I think we also live in a culture
and we live in a world where a lot of

356
00:19:17,341 --> 00:19:20,850
people aren't honest with each other
and just don't kind of openly have

357
00:19:20,851 --> 00:19:22,020
conversations with you and,

358
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:24,720
and talk about things that are hard to
talk about or talk about things that may

359
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:28,830
be difficult or, or hurtful,
um, or potentially hurtful.

360
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,950
And I think that if you come in
to those types of moments, just,

361
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:37,310
I think I'm wanting to kind of wanting
to understand and wanting to understand

362
00:19:37,711 --> 00:19:40,470
where somebody else is coming from.
It doesn't have to be confrontational,

363
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,220
it doesn't have to be ugly.
Um,

364
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:46,650
you can have a really honest above
board conversation that is meaningful.

365
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:49,500
And I think that's, so for me, I
think that's the biggest thing is I,

366
00:19:49,501 --> 00:19:53,370
I think the best thing I do
sometimes is shut up and listen.

367
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:56,280
So if you had,
let's just say you were teaching,

368
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
went back to Nyu and you're giving a
guest lecture to would be documentarians

369
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,160
and somebody came up to you and they said,
you know what,

370
00:20:05,161 --> 00:20:06,690
I just had some incredible opportunity.

371
00:20:06,691 --> 00:20:11,400
I'm actually going out this weekend to
interview 10 people for my film for the

372
00:20:11,401 --> 00:20:15,150
first time. Yeah. I've never
done this before. How do I
get them to open up? Right.

373
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,620
What would you say to them?
Um,

374
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,350
I would say first talk about things
that they care about. You know,

375
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:22,370
get them to talk about things that are
meaningful to them in the beginning. Uh,

376
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,790
things that they like,
things that they love.

377
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:26,610
You don't want to go right in to like,
so what's it like to have cancer?

378
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,730
You don't want that to be
the first key question.

379
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,680
How do you want to kind of work up to
this? Cause you want to, you want to have,

380
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,670
it's it's relationship.

381
00:20:32,671 --> 00:20:35,640
You're building a relationship with
someone over the course of a conversation

382
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,880
and you want to have them trust you.
Um,

383
00:20:38,881 --> 00:20:42,120
and part of what you also want to do
in that conversation is offer up things

384
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:46,950
that are similar and kind of where
they're coming from or experiences that

385
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,020
you've had that kind of put them in a,
in a comparative level.

386
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,230
And I think that then you kind of build
up and build up and then you can start

387
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,600
chipping away at the
information you really want,

388
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:59,950
but you need to take the time to build
that, that relationship. I think the, uh,

389
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:03,840
the providing of, she lets me ruining
the podcast right there with my thoughts.

390
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:08,590
Okay. This is, this is
cinema, audio verite, the, Ah,

391
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,930
the advice you just in the movie theater,
everyone,

392
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:17,680
the advice you just gave about
being, well, I'm paraphrasing here,

393
00:21:17,681 --> 00:21:20,470
but you're being vulnerable
yourself to illicit vulnerability.

394
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:24,100
It was also something that was underscored
for me by a guy named Neil Strauss

395
00:21:24,101 --> 00:21:27,460
who's an author but wrote for rolling
stone and New York Times did a lot of

396
00:21:27,461 --> 00:21:31,380
interviews and it's incredible how that
gear shifts the entire dynamic. Yeah.

397
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:35,830
Uh, why warrior poets? Why
warrior poets? That's, yeah,

398
00:21:35,831 --> 00:21:37,660
that's the name of your company
is the name of my company.

399
00:21:37,661 --> 00:21:42,070
And it came a few years ago by,
I'll give credit where credit is due.

400
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:45,850
There was a, a former assistant at the
Gersh agency who's now a full agent,

401
00:21:45,851 --> 00:21:50,170
a guy named Sean Barclay, who right after
supersize me, I went out to La to have,

402
00:21:50,171 --> 00:21:51,510
you know, it's like when you go
out and they have the meetings,

403
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:53,110
like we want you to meet all these people,

404
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,330
the deathstar meetings with like
you have already been meetings.

405
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:58,090
And so I'm being driven all around town,
meeting with all the studios,

406
00:21:58,091 --> 00:21:59,900
meeting with all the folks.
And so I,

407
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,460
as I'm being driven around by
then assistant Shawn Barclay, um,

408
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:07,780
he were just talking about, you know, you
know what I want to do, what I want, my,

409
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:09,730
what, what, what are we going to do next?

410
00:22:09,731 --> 00:22:11,350
And by that point we'd
already sold 30 days,

411
00:22:11,351 --> 00:22:14,200
30 days was already going to be the
thing we did after supersize me.

412
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,260
And so we were talking about kind of
the path that I want to be on and the

413
00:22:17,261 --> 00:22:19,720
stories I want to tell. And you
know, what's important to me.

414
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,840
And then I said I want to, I'm
starting a new company. I need,

415
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,860
I need a new name because my
old company, this is, this is,

416
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:29,710
I'll have a quick aside.
My first company was a web company,

417
00:22:29,711 --> 00:22:32,050
so we started off in
2000 with a web company.

418
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:35,890
The idea as the bubble was
exploding was I wanted to create a,

419
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,170
a content company where we would create
programming online and then spring

420
00:22:39,171 --> 00:22:40,390
boarded off to film or television.

421
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:44,230
So we created a company called the
interactive consortium. Terrible name,

422
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,600
terrible name, but it's been, it's
that interactive in the title.

423
00:22:46,601 --> 00:22:49,840
So it must've been something and it was
a consortium of talented people that

424
00:22:49,841 --> 00:22:52,090
came together to tell stories.
And so there was,

425
00:22:52,091 --> 00:22:54,820
there was a logic in my mind just
to [inaudible] name was terrible,

426
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:57,790
but we call herself the con for short
cause we called ourself the consortium,

427
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:58,840
which,
and it was the con,

428
00:22:58,841 --> 00:23:01,720
if you look at supersize
me at the beginning it says
the con that's the title of

429
00:23:01,721 --> 00:23:03,400
Guinea, which I thought was
a great name for a company.

430
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,960
Not when you're trying to raise money,

431
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:09,090
it's not a good name for a company
that's not a good chasing financier's.

432
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:12,640
You don't want to be called the
con Jd Salinger and associates

433
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,870
and associates. And so this
was, so that was the, uh,

434
00:23:16,871 --> 00:23:18,310
so that was the previous
name of the company. I said,

435
00:23:18,311 --> 00:23:21,640
I want to start a new company.
Um, and, and so he said, well,

436
00:23:21,641 --> 00:23:24,310
what about warrior
poets? And I said, as a,

437
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,250
as a big brave heart fan and as a
Scotsman, I said, why? Because I,

438
00:23:27,251 --> 00:23:29,580
because I'm Scottish and because of
Braveheart, he goes, hey, he goes,

439
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,950
warrior poets has nothing to do with
Braveheart. He goes, that's a, that is a,

440
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:36,910
a phrase. It was stolen by, by
Mel Gibson for the movie. He goes,

441
00:23:36,911 --> 00:23:41,350
warrior poets were around throughout
history. Like these were people who, um,

442
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:43,990
who were poets or who were
musicians or who were,

443
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:48,170
who were people who the masses
with their wit and their in their,

444
00:23:48,171 --> 00:23:49,280
in their writings,
their music.

445
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:52,070
But when time came to fight
for what they believed in,

446
00:23:52,071 --> 00:23:56,240
they would lay down their instruments
and pick up swords or pick up or pick up

447
00:23:56,241 --> 00:23:59,270
whatever they had to go fight or spears
to go fight for what they believed in to

448
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:02,060
fight for their country. And I was like, I
said, that's exactly what we are. I said,

449
00:24:02,061 --> 00:24:05,420
we are warrior poets. Yes, that's the
name. And so that's where it came from.

450
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:09,470
And how do you choose your projects?
Should it be more specific?

451
00:24:09,471 --> 00:24:13,250
How did you decide to do 30 days after?

452
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:17,520
Supersize me cause I mean Bam suddenly
got the iron, you know, the, the,

453
00:24:17,521 --> 00:24:19,610
the irons hot. Yeah. And as,

454
00:24:19,611 --> 00:24:23,150
and this was before we got the idea
for 30 days before supersize me,

455
00:24:23,151 --> 00:24:28,090
he was even finished. So we were in
post on the movie. Um, we said, I said,

456
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:29,840
I decided we just submitted
the movie to Sundance.

457
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,570
So we had even gotten into Sundance yet.
We just submitted the film and I said,

458
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:36,090
we should have a test screening of the
movie just so we see what's happening.

459
00:24:36,091 --> 00:24:38,600
And cause that's what you did. You had
test screenings. The studios all did it.

460
00:24:38,601 --> 00:24:41,000
I said, we should do what they do
to be successful. We should do that.

461
00:24:41,001 --> 00:24:44,150
So we got clipboards cause clipboards
make you look 30% more official.

462
00:24:44,151 --> 00:24:47,200
And we stood outside of the Angelica
right up the street on the corner of house

463
00:24:47,201 --> 00:24:49,880
in and Broadway and we said, excuse me,
is people were coming out of the movies.

464
00:24:49,881 --> 00:24:50,200
We like,

465
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,280
would you like to come to the test
screening of a new independent documentary

466
00:24:52,281 --> 00:24:54,080
and be like Ooh yes I would.
That would be great.

467
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:57,950
So we signed up like 50 people who came
over to the gold crest screening room on

468
00:24:57,951 --> 00:25:01,850
the west side. And it was myself
and my two editors. Um, Julie,

469
00:25:01,851 --> 00:25:06,020
Bob and Stella went over to the screening
and the 50 people watched the movie.

470
00:25:06,021 --> 00:25:09,200
And then after the film, this one woman
stood and we came down front and we said,

471
00:25:09,201 --> 00:25:11,090
anybody have any questions or
anything in this? One woman said,

472
00:25:11,091 --> 00:25:12,470
I just want to say thank you.

473
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:17,770
Thank you for making this
movie and showing the world
finally how terrible these

474
00:25:17,841 --> 00:25:22,310
corporations are, that they're
screwing us and they're killing us.

475
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,310
And then a guy on the other
side of the is a hold on, what,

476
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:27,500
what movie did you watch? And he's like,
what are you out of your mind? He says,

477
00:25:27,501 --> 00:25:30,080
that's not what this movie's about it
all. And so they start you, you're crazy.

478
00:25:30,081 --> 00:25:31,410
You're crazy, you're crazy, you're crazy.

479
00:25:31,411 --> 00:25:33,280
So the yelling at one
another and I just lean over,

480
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:38,150
lean over to my editors and I'm like,
this is awesome. This is amazing.

481
00:25:38,151 --> 00:25:39,950
This is going to be,
she was incredible.

482
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:43,790
But it elicited this like awesome
visceral reaction in people.

483
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,140
Like it really struck a chord.

484
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:47,840
And so the next day when we were
back in the edit room, I said,

485
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:51,530
how do we do that every, every
day? How do we do that every week?

486
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,440
Like how do we transition this into
something because of the film and the film

487
00:25:54,441 --> 00:25:54,981
was fast.

488
00:25:54,981 --> 00:25:59,981
Like I got the idea for the film on
Thanksgiving of 2002 and a year and a day

489
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:00,890
later,
the day after Thanksgiving,

490
00:26:00,891 --> 00:26:04,790
2003 I got the phone call that we got
into Sundance. So I mean it was fast. Wow,

491
00:26:04,791 --> 00:26:08,080
that's really fast. For a
docket super fast. Like from,

492
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:10,760
from idea to like delivery
in the film festival.

493
00:26:10,761 --> 00:26:14,600
What happened on Thanksgiving that
triggered this? I was sitting,

494
00:26:14,601 --> 00:26:19,150
I was sitting on my mom's couch in a
spectacular trip to fan haze when a news

495
00:26:19,151 --> 00:26:22,600
story came on about these two girls
that were suing Mcdonald's. Um,

496
00:26:22,601 --> 00:26:24,980
and so these girls said, we're fat, we're
sick and it's your fault. And I'm like,

497
00:26:24,981 --> 00:26:28,160
well that come on. That's
crazy. Said. He's like, you're
going to sue somebody for,

498
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:28,580
you know,

499
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:31,610
selling you food that you bought that you
ate and then blame them for it. I said,

500
00:26:31,611 --> 00:26:34,010
how can you do that? And
then a spokesperson for
Mcdonald's came on and said,

501
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,960
you can't link our food
to these girls being sick.

502
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,270
Can't link our food and these girls
being obese, our food is healthy,

503
00:26:38,271 --> 00:26:40,160
it's nutritious, it's good
for you. And I was like, well,

504
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:42,350
I don't know if you could say that either.
And I said,

505
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:45,210
cause if it's that good for me then
shouldn't I be able to eat it for 30 days

506
00:26:45,211 --> 00:26:48,750
straight with no side effects? And I
was like, oh, that's it. That's it.

507
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:51,110
And so that was the, that was the,
that was the moment. And then, yeah.

508
00:26:51,111 --> 00:26:54,570
So then a year later we got into
the festival and, and so it was,

509
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,430
we were in the edit. I
said, how do we do that?

510
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:59,520
How do we do that on a regular basis?
And we said, let's make it a series.

511
00:26:59,521 --> 00:27:01,160
Let's make it a series where,
and,

512
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:04,020
and the original idea was it was going
to be me and every episode kind of

513
00:27:04,021 --> 00:27:06,630
putting myself into these situations.
At which point my girlfriend said,

514
00:27:06,631 --> 00:27:08,190
you're not going to have
a girlfriend very long,

515
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:11,330
cause I guess it makes me then I'm gone
for six months at a time when we do that

516
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,350
six episodes of that show.
Um,

517
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:16,350
but as soon as the movie exploded
at Sundance and we sold it,

518
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,960
I was on a plane to la and we sold that,

519
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:21,540
we pitched that show and
sold it to FX the next week.

520
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:23,580
So it was a week after Sundance,
we'd already sold that.

521
00:27:23,581 --> 00:27:25,580
So the movie wasn't even in
theaters and we'd set up that show.

522
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,960
And in 30 days we,
were there any particular shows or,

523
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:33,600
yeah,

524
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,910
proposals that you weren't able to
make weather with that or incitement.

525
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:38,800
Was there anything that got
vetoed their results there?

526
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:41,490
The only thing that ever got vetoed
is when we were doing the immigration

527
00:27:41,491 --> 00:27:44,840
episode. I wanted to have a great
episode by the way. Thanks. No, I mean,

528
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:46,450
I'm really proud of that
really strong episode.

529
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,900
And for me the best episodes of that
show are the shows that I'm not in.

530
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:51,900
Like I understand why everybody's like
now the ones that you're under the best,

531
00:27:51,901 --> 00:27:52,860
but it's like, but that's, for me,

532
00:27:52,861 --> 00:27:55,950
that's not the best because the best
proof of that show is people who have to

533
00:27:55,951 --> 00:27:59,760
defend their beliefs and when somebody
has to get in there and basically to

534
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:02,280
people that disagree with
them or contract them to say,

535
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:06,300
here's what I believe and why, and to
have the courage to continue to one,

536
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:09,930
you have those beliefs be questioned
and also be open to kind of seeing the

537
00:28:09,931 --> 00:28:13,130
world in a different way. It takes a
tremendous amount of, of, of courage. So,

538
00:28:13,131 --> 00:28:17,100
I mean, I think that's the, I love those
episodes, but the immigration episode,

539
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:19,490
when we first came up with that,
um,

540
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:23,430
I wanted to go across the border and
have a coyote bring me over. I said,

541
00:28:23,431 --> 00:28:24,630
I want to go to Mexico.
And I said,

542
00:28:24,631 --> 00:28:27,660
and I want to come over with a bunch of
illegal immigrants and who are basically

543
00:28:27,661 --> 00:28:29,970
sneak into the country with a
coyote and show how it's done.

544
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:34,590
And Big FX lawyer said, no. And I said,
well, come on. I said, and then if I said,

545
00:28:34,591 --> 00:28:35,850
well,
let's talk to the Fox lawyer.

546
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:37,790
So then they went to the
next person above that,

547
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,160
the coyote being the term for someone
who facilitates. That's right. So, yeah,

548
00:28:41,161 --> 00:28:44,460
so the, yeah, the coyotes are the guys
who bring you across the border illegally.

549
00:28:44,461 --> 00:28:47,880
And so then I went to big
Fox, his attorney in big
boxes turning. He was like,

550
00:28:47,881 --> 00:28:51,360
absolutely not. And so it
was the only thing that, uh,

551
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,430
that I really wanted to do
for the show that we wouldn't,

552
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:55,230
because they basically
said, if I, if I, and I did,

553
00:28:55,231 --> 00:28:58,590
if I did it against their will and
I just, cause I said, why don't we,

554
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,900
why don't we just do it? We'll just go
shoot it and we can put it in the show.

555
00:29:00,901 --> 00:29:03,100
And they're like, if you do
that, then, you know, they're,

556
00:29:03,101 --> 00:29:04,000
they basically threatened it,

557
00:29:04,001 --> 00:29:06,870
like cancel the show and then take
us off the air and not insure us.

558
00:29:06,871 --> 00:29:10,080
And so I said, all right, we won't
do that. I got, and they're like,

559
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:13,670
if you hadn't asked us, that's right.
That's plausible deniability. I,

560
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:17,670
you've gone and screwed both. Now you've
gone and brought it up. So now it's a,

561
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,370
I'm a real believer in that it's
better to beg forgiveness than ask for

562
00:29:20,371 --> 00:29:23,510
permission these days. Yeah. What, uh,

563
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:28,890
for someone who's unfamiliar with your
work, yeah. If you had to choose, say,

564
00:29:28,891 --> 00:29:33,891
two or three films or television
episodes that you would,

565
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:39,820
if you could make mandatory viewing for
all Americans, what would they be? Um,

566
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,650
let's think. I mean, the supersize
me, I feel like everybody's seen.

567
00:29:44,651 --> 00:29:46,420
So I'd be like everybody, I'm, I'm
stopping to people all the time.

568
00:29:46,421 --> 00:29:50,950
We've seen that, which is
still mind blowing to me. Um,
but I think I'm in 30 days.

569
00:29:50,951 --> 00:29:52,180
I love the,
uh,

570
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:56,860
the prison episode of 30 days I think
is a great episode people should watch.

571
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:00,640
Um, especially as we live in a country
where we're still sending people to prison

572
00:30:00,641 --> 00:30:05,090
and we've turned prisons into
profit. Um, I think it's a, it's a,

573
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:09,010
it's a great episode to watch and it will
make you so angry. So I think that's,

574
00:30:09,011 --> 00:30:11,680
that's one. Um, I love
greatest movie ever sold.

575
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:15,340
I think greatest movie ever sold in just
the conceit of that film is spectacular

576
00:30:15,341 --> 00:30:17,140
for people. Haven't seen it. I'll
just give you the quick rundown.

577
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:19,300
It's a movie about product placement,

578
00:30:19,301 --> 00:30:21,490
marketing and advertising
where the whole film,

579
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:24,820
it's paid for and made possible by product
placement, marketing and advertising.

580
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:29,590
Very Meta if spectacularly matter.
It's so good. Um, Mane and tail.

581
00:30:29,591 --> 00:30:32,450
One of my favorite sponsors of all time
is they sponsored that movie for is you

582
00:30:32,451 --> 00:30:35,680
don't know what Mane and tail his mane
and tail is a magical shampoo that it's

583
00:30:35,681 --> 00:30:40,420
for both horses and people.
Yeah. Which I which I also love.

584
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:44,110
I love it cause cause you know how many
times have we all been there where we're

585
00:30:44,111 --> 00:30:46,120
in the shower with our horse

586
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:51,530
and we say why?
Why do I need to products high heart.

587
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:56,260
Why is there just not one shampoo
for both of us? I'll tell you,

588
00:30:56,261 --> 00:30:56,981
I'll tell you a quick story,

589
00:30:56,981 --> 00:30:59,620
which is my favorite things when we were
making that movie because when I saw

590
00:30:59,621 --> 00:31:03,280
this I found it and you see it, you see
in the film when I find this in a store,

591
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:06,250
like I had no idea this existed and I
find this product and I'm like it is one

592
00:31:06,251 --> 00:31:09,370
of the greatest days of my life that
I have found this product that I'm,

593
00:31:09,371 --> 00:31:12,400
and you read the label and it gives you
like the instructions on the back of a

594
00:31:12,401 --> 00:31:15,300
bottle of mane and tail are amazing.
Like is it tells you how old are you?

595
00:31:15,301 --> 00:31:18,880
Use It to watch your horse.
It's ridiculous. And so I keep,

596
00:31:18,881 --> 00:31:21,550
so I start calling Devon Catsa Devin,

597
00:31:21,551 --> 00:31:25,810
who is now a very good friend and he's
the president, president of the company.

598
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,760
So I'm like calling you.
I'm stalking him,

599
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:31,000
trying to get him to return my call to
be in the movie, to be in the movie.

600
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:35,260
And finally he calls me back and he
says, um, Egos. So, so just tell me,

601
00:31:35,261 --> 00:31:36,350
what is this movie about?
Anyway,

602
00:31:36,351 --> 00:31:38,020
so I explained that what the
movie is and he goes, so what,

603
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:39,940
so how would you see us in the movie?
Like how would we,

604
00:31:39,941 --> 00:31:43,730
because we don't pay to be in movies,
you know, we don't do that, you know, so,

605
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,940
so how would you see? And I said,
okay, well here's, here's how it is.

606
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:50,920
So now picture of this. So it's a
close up on a bottle of Mane and tail,

607
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:54,460
and the camera slowly starts to pull back.
And as the camera pulls back,

608
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:57,850
you see me washing my little
boy's hair in, the camera,

609
00:31:57,851 --> 00:31:58,990
pulls back a little bit more.

610
00:31:58,991 --> 00:32:02,500
And then you see me and we're in a bath
tub and you just see me washing my hair

611
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:05,530
in the bathtub and then the camera pulls
back a little bit more and it pulls by

612
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:10,540
more in the ECB turned to my left and
I'm washing my Shetland pony and the guy

613
00:32:10,991 --> 00:32:14,200
goes into the phone is silent
for a minute, and then he goes,

614
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:18,280
that's the greatest integration I've ever
heard in my life. It's amazing. He goes,

615
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,800
oh, that's fantastic.
Oh for a minute there,

616
00:32:20,801 --> 00:32:22,570
I thought you were gonna do
something weird with the product.

617
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:26,980
But then he goes on to tell me,
he goes on to tell me,

618
00:32:26,981 --> 00:32:30,910
because apparently it was
in the Will Ferrell movie
blades of glory. And he said,

619
00:32:30,911 --> 00:32:33,730
he goes, so, so I said to will, I
said, listen, I just want to make sure,

620
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:36,100
like you're not going to do anything
like masturbate with it, are Ya?

621
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:39,680
And I was like, I love it. That's where
he draws the line of what's weird.

622
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:44,360
We'll barrel masturbating with Mane and
tail in blades of glory would be weird.

623
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:49,440
Me In the bathtub with a horse. Totally
fine. Totally fine. Oh my God. Yeah.

624
00:32:49,441 --> 00:32:53,780
It's amazing. Okay, so back to the
results. So there's that movie inside man.

625
00:32:53,781 --> 00:32:58,580
There's so many episodes of inside man
that I love the season one of inside man,

626
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:01,040
we do an episode about elder
care and this is on Netflix.

627
00:33:01,041 --> 00:33:02,810
All three seasons of
inside man or on Netflix,

628
00:33:02,811 --> 00:33:07,811
all three seasons of in 30 days or
on Netflix season one of inside man,

629
00:33:07,881 --> 00:33:09,140
we do an episode about uh,

630
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:14,530
about elder care where I move in
with my grandmother and it is for me,

631
00:33:14,721 --> 00:33:19,490
it's one of the most raw,
honest and powerful things
I've ever made. Yeah. Awesome.

632
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:24,140
Yeah. Uh, the, the marijuana
episode also a super,

633
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:25,130
super strong,

634
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:28,370
such a good show and it's like that Guy
Steve de Angelo and what they're doing

635
00:33:28,371 --> 00:33:32,390
up at harborside medical in, in Oakland
is phenomenal. Like, cause you go there,

636
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,060
you have these visions of
what dispensaries are going
to be and everybody thinks

637
00:33:35,061 --> 00:33:38,420
they're like dodgy and shady and it's
going to bring crime to the neighborhoods.

638
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:39,890
And this place is beautiful.

639
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:43,010
It looks like a health clinic and they
run it like a health clinic. They have,

640
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:47,060
they have a health instructors who were,
there are, they have reiki instructors,

641
00:33:47,061 --> 00:33:49,250
they have psychiatrists
that you can meet with.

642
00:33:49,251 --> 00:33:51,200
Not to mention all the product
that you can buy there. I mean,

643
00:33:51,201 --> 00:33:53,510
and it's run like a proper
clinic and it's phenomenal.

644
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,730
Like that's how every clinic in America,

645
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:58,880
it should be like every dispensary
should be. When did you go?

646
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,580
Just since we're talking about health,
I think it was the inside man, uh,

647
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:06,410
when you went to Thailand Bumrungrad yeah.
And Bronwyn Grad and Thailand,

648
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:09,860
which is incredible facility.
It's phenomenal.

649
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:13,760
Would you ever w why or why not?

650
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:18,260
Would you go to Butler and
Grad for medical treatment
yourself? I mean, I would,

651
00:34:18,261 --> 00:34:19,370
I would go back after being there.

652
00:34:19,371 --> 00:34:22,730
I had such a great experience and
depending on what I had to have done,

653
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,690
like if I had to have surgery that had
real serious recuperation where I was

654
00:34:26,691 --> 00:34:30,560
going to be laid up for like weeks going
there and having the surgery done and

655
00:34:30,561 --> 00:34:32,480
then knowing that I'm going to uh,

656
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:34,700
be on a beach for like the
next four weeks in a place,

657
00:34:34,701 --> 00:34:39,690
it's going to cost me a fraction.
Um, I think is worth it. And uh,

658
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:42,590
and I've spoken to people who since
that episode had gone there for medical

659
00:34:42,591 --> 00:34:44,990
procedures just because they
saw the show and they're like,

660
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:49,220
it's half of what it was going to cost
me in the states or less, you know, it's,

661
00:34:49,221 --> 00:34:51,140
it's remarkable. Yeah. Particularly,

662
00:34:51,141 --> 00:34:55,670
I mean if you're doing say an elective
surgery or something that doesn't have,

663
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,390
you're not having a brain tumor treated
right necessarily might not be covered

664
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:02,330
or it might not be covered. Exactly. I
mean, I went to Nicaragua at one point,

665
00:35:02,331 --> 00:35:05,630
this is when I was writing the four
body and realized, wait a second,

666
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:09,500
if I just do say my,
my full panel of blood testing,

667
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,900
what is considered sort
of the highest end,

668
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:15,020
and I don't necessarily recommend
Nicaragua for everybody, but uh,

669
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:18,620
while I'm there on vacation, it
will pay for my vacation. Yeah,

670
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:21,830
that's what she was incredible.
That's right. And not only that,

671
00:35:21,831 --> 00:35:25,310
but they did a stat, which means
for people who aren't familiar,

672
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:27,260
you get your results back in 24 hours.

673
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:31,790
So it was like literally turned around
everything in the hospital in four or

674
00:35:31,791 --> 00:35:33,710
five hours. It was just phenomenal. Well,

675
00:35:33,711 --> 00:35:36,080
that's what I love it when I was a
bummer Grad, you'd get a blood test,

676
00:35:36,081 --> 00:35:37,190
everything's in one building.

677
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:40,860
She'd get a test on downstairs and I'd
go upstairs to see my next doctor and

678
00:35:40,861 --> 00:35:44,700
whether it was an MRI or
a blood test or other,

679
00:35:44,701 --> 00:35:46,950
other panels they were doing,
and you have your blood test.

680
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,320
I get it done downstairs.
And by the time I got upstairs,

681
00:35:49,321 --> 00:35:51,450
the doctor already had all the results,
like in real time.

682
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,150
They were getting the results to them
because they also process the blood in the

683
00:35:54,151 --> 00:35:57,570
hospital. So it wasn't being sent out to
a lab like they do here in the states.

684
00:35:57,571 --> 00:35:58,590
You didn't go down to the,

685
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:01,200
what are those lab clinics that you always
end up going through their own popups.

686
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:06,100
Oh, Labcorp, Labcorp, labcorp. Where it's
like a guy in like a basement with like,

687
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:09,810
you feel like you're going to a
methadone clinic. It's rough. So dodgy.

688
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:11,880
But it's like everything,
everything in one place.

689
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:14,700
And part of the reason they said
why we can do it so cheaply is cause

690
00:36:14,701 --> 00:36:17,730
everything's under one roof.
We're not kind of third partying anything.

691
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:20,490
And he's like, and I'm there and I'm like,
why can't we just do more of that here?

692
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:25,350
Why can't that just happen here? Medical
tourism, that's, I feel like I should,

693
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,290
I should. Uh, well people go watch the
episode. Can people, there we go. Episode.

694
00:36:28,291 --> 00:36:29,490
Yeah, they can watch it. It's a,

695
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:33,780
it's a season three of inside
man album run Grad U. M r u n g.

696
00:36:33,781 --> 00:36:38,730
R. A. D. Correct. And uh, people will
be very, very impressed. It's, it's,

697
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,830
it looks like a more seasoned,
not at all. Yeah, exactly.

698
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:43,470
It's not what you would
expect at all. Yeah. Uh,

699
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:48,210
one of the questions that came quite
a bit from my fans was how do you get

700
00:36:48,211 --> 00:36:52,860
people to care about important issues
in an environment where there's such a

701
00:36:52,861 --> 00:36:57,720
delusion, such a barrage of noise?
Yeah. How do you accomplish that?

702
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:01,170
Yeah, that's a great question. Cause
it's like every day we feel like,

703
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:04,020
are we even doing anything they did.
I'd actually are people paying attention,

704
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:04,520
you know,
you,

705
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,650
you hope that you make things that will
make a difference or that people will

706
00:37:07,651 --> 00:37:10,380
listen to or at least create
some level of empathy and,

707
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,320
and change of viewpoint for someone.
And I think that,

708
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:17,160
I think the hardest thing is one,
getting people just to watch.

709
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:18,750
So I think once you get them to watch,

710
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,520
I think that the way that I hope people
get affected is because when we tell the

711
00:37:23,521 --> 00:37:26,340
stories, I get affected by them. Um, once
you get immersed in them, and I mean,

712
00:37:26,341 --> 00:37:28,890
you know this better than anyone is once
you kind of get into these worlds and

713
00:37:28,891 --> 00:37:32,460
see it, it's a part of you forever.
Like that becomes a part of your life.

714
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:36,980
And whether it's me going to a foreign
country for medical tourism or um,

715
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:40,200
you know, me was, I was doing in, in,

716
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:43,650
in this past season where I'm just
like eliminating toxins from my house,

717
00:37:43,651 --> 00:37:46,440
all these like poisons and
cleaning products and stuff
that we use everyday that

718
00:37:46,441 --> 00:37:51,140
we just don't even realize. Um, I
think that, uh, I think for me it's,

719
00:37:51,141 --> 00:37:53,820
it's taking people on this
vicarious journey with me.

720
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:56,940
And so long as I am open
and honest with you,

721
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:01,290
then you're willing to pay attention.
And I think that's a big one. Um,

722
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:04,200
a friend of mine a few
years ago gave some,

723
00:38:04,201 --> 00:38:06,960
gave me some good advice
where he said, uh, he said,

724
00:38:06,961 --> 00:38:10,920
you can't be afraid to show your scars.
He goes, that's, that's, that's what you,

725
00:38:10,921 --> 00:38:12,930
that's who you are.
And he goes and you can't,

726
00:38:12,931 --> 00:38:14,780
you have to continue to stay true to that.
And I think that's,

727
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:16,290
it was some of the best advice I ever got.

728
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:18,390
What would you consider
some of your scars?

729
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:22,060
I think it's just being open and honest
about your life. I think it's, you know,

730
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:24,300
talking about the fact that,
you know,

731
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:29,250
I'm divorced and talking about the fact
that, you know, I uh, um, you know,

732
00:38:29,251 --> 00:38:31,130
kind of what led to that and,
and,

733
00:38:31,131 --> 00:38:34,200
and being open and honest about your life
and the things you've experienced and

734
00:38:34,201 --> 00:38:35,950
not being afraid to talk
about that you know,

735
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:39,730
your upbringing and how that affected you.
I think the more you can have those,

736
00:38:39,731 --> 00:38:43,510
the, that, that honesty in those
relationships that you build with people,

737
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:46,440
that creates a trust and it creates a
trust not only with the people who watched

738
00:38:46,441 --> 00:38:48,190
the show, but with the people
that you're talking to.

739
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:54,210
If you are looking at a particular idea
that you want to put force in the world

740
00:38:54,971 --> 00:38:59,971
or explore and it could be adapted to
documentary format or television format,

741
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:03,610
what are the factors that lead
you to choose one or the other?

742
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,210
You mean whether it's movie or TV? That's
right. I think it's about, I think it's,

743
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:11,170
it's can it sustain one because there's
some movies that are meant to be some

744
00:39:11,171 --> 00:39:13,150
ideas that are going to
be movies and there's,

745
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:16,930
and you see this a lot of time when you
watch documentaries when 45 minutes and

746
00:39:16,931 --> 00:39:19,330
you're like, this should
be done now as, but,

747
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:21,400
but everybody wants to make
a feature movie like, no, no,

748
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:22,810
I'm going to make it a
feature. And it's like, no,

749
00:39:22,811 --> 00:39:25,540
this should have been about 40
minutes, 45 minutes, 50 minutes.

750
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:29,140
But they end up making it 75 80 and
that lasts 30. You're just like, oh,

751
00:39:29,141 --> 00:39:31,300
it's just trudging along and it
should have been over. So for us,

752
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:34,270
we avoid that by never kind
of putting ourselves there.

753
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,910
And so we say this is this,

754
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:38,260
there's things that are meant to be
90 minutes because they're big, big,

755
00:39:38,261 --> 00:39:39,190
deep explorations.

756
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:42,100
But especially now there's other ones
that you can take to TV and I can have an

757
00:39:42,101 --> 00:39:45,340
even deeper exploration if I can do two
to three episodes on it and therefore

758
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:47,470
episodes on it, um, that are hour long.

759
00:39:47,471 --> 00:39:51,820
And then you can have a real deep dive
into these topics. Um, I think that,

760
00:39:51,821 --> 00:39:54,910
uh, so for us, what, I mean
this was, that's why it's great.

761
00:39:54,911 --> 00:39:58,330
Like I loved being a storyteller right
now. I love being a content creator,

762
00:39:58,331 --> 00:40:00,580
being a filmmaker, a director,
whatever you wanna call it,

763
00:40:00,581 --> 00:40:02,680
because there are places now
to tell all these stories,

764
00:40:02,681 --> 00:40:05,980
whether it's 90 minutes or 30 minutes
or 20 minutes or 10 minutes or three

765
00:40:05,981 --> 00:40:10,710
minutes, like we made an amazing bunch
of movies, um, a few years ago, uh,

766
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:12,690
called focus forward,
um,

767
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:16,060
that GE paid for where we basically
made these three minute short films that

768
00:40:16,061 --> 00:40:17,860
were all about innovators
around the world,

769
00:40:17,861 --> 00:40:19,760
people who are doing incredible things.
Um,

770
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:22,420
and each one of these movies were three
minutes long and they're powerful.

771
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:22,871
They're,

772
00:40:22,871 --> 00:40:27,490
they're so beautiful and inspiring and
now like they've seen like they'd been

773
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:30,250
seemed like 100 million people around
the world because it's one of those where

774
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:31,870
anybody will give you around the boxing.

775
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:34,450
Like anybody will give you three
minutes and once you watch one,

776
00:40:34,451 --> 00:40:36,870
then you'll watch too. You watch three.
What we saw is it whoever, if you,

777
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,420
if you made it through one, then you
watched five, the average was five,

778
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:45,250
which is awesome. So going back
to the guest lecture at, uh,

779
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:48,460
Nyu. Yeah. So I'm going to, we're
going to be calling me soon now.

780
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:53,690
Hey, uh, we heard the lecture.
Yeah, the podcast and Tim's right.

781
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:57,330
You should come to a guest lecture
in Septic, the administration at Nyu.

782
00:40:57,930 --> 00:41:01,830
And so you have all these bright eyed
bushy tailed students who are say fixated

783
00:41:01,831 --> 00:41:06,150
on the feature film
documentary and they say,

784
00:41:06,151 --> 00:41:09,810
I know you say that we, we, we could do
these short things but you know, really,

785
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:12,290
really obsessed with this
idea of doing a feature. Uh,

786
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:15,150
what cat warnings or
advice would you give them?

787
00:41:15,151 --> 00:41:17,760
And I just want to repeat one thing that
you mentioned before we got started to

788
00:41:17,761 --> 00:41:20,370
be, we're looking at my, the
audio equipment and I have
here, which is very simple.

789
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:25,050
It's, it's a zoom h six which h with XLR
cables that plug into simple is good,

790
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:28,950
simple, good. Sm 58 sure. Mikes.
And we were talking about, you know,

791
00:41:28,951 --> 00:41:31,320
fancy every time I tried to get fancy
and could they give this to you or you

792
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:34,100
have a big assignment? I hope
they gave no, no zoom. That

793
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:38,480
one's on me next time call me. Uh, the,

794
00:41:38,481 --> 00:41:40,970
and you said once you get fancy,
fancy gets broken. That's right.

795
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:45,860
And it's just such a nice mantra I think
to keep in mind that could really help

796
00:41:45,861 --> 00:41:50,450
someone. What did, what warnings or advice
would you give to aspiring documentary?

797
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:52,880
Me, the biggest thing is we
try to overcomplicate things.

798
00:41:52,881 --> 00:41:55,160
When you start making movies or
even TV shows, whatever it is,

799
00:41:55,570 --> 00:41:58,250
you have these grandiose
ideas of everything that
you need and everything that

800
00:41:58,251 --> 00:42:00,590
has to, has to be done.
And especially today,

801
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:05,150
like the youtube of vacation of content
creation and content consumption has

802
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:08,450
shifted our,
our concept of what,

803
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:11,570
what it means to make something
good or palatable. Um,

804
00:42:11,571 --> 00:42:15,920
we are infinitely more forgiving of
stuff that looks dodgy for good story.

805
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:18,890
You can sacrifice quality for great story.
So for me it's like,

806
00:42:18,891 --> 00:42:20,510
it's all about the story.
It doesn't matter.

807
00:42:20,511 --> 00:42:22,400
Like I'll watch shaky camera footage now.

808
00:42:22,401 --> 00:42:24,500
I'll watch somebody like
shitty thing on their phone.

809
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:28,040
So long as it's a great story and I'm
engaged because we've gotten to the point

810
00:42:28,041 --> 00:42:31,450
now where we are past that we're forgiving
of all that. True Vadio too. Yes.

811
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:32,240
Rubato like you'll,

812
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:36,170
you'll so long as I can hear it and
it's not just the whole time I will,

813
00:42:36,171 --> 00:42:39,770
I will be, I will still be forgiving of
it. Um, and I think that's what I tell.

814
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:43,070
I tell young filmmakers all the time, his
story first, it's all about the story.

815
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:45,470
It's like everything else about what you
want it to be or how long you want it

816
00:42:45,471 --> 00:42:48,860
to be. It should be as long
as it needs to be ultimately,

817
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:50,000
but it's all about the story.

818
00:42:50,001 --> 00:42:52,310
And if you've gotten the beginning and
middle and an end and you've told your

819
00:42:52,311 --> 00:42:55,070
core in 40 minutes or 60 minutes,

820
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:57,820
then don't stretch it out because
now you're just putting your,

821
00:42:57,830 --> 00:42:59,690
just your dressing ups on the,
it doesn't need it.

822
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:05,200
If you wanted to give people examples
or resources for masterful storytelling,

823
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:10,430
there are any particular books,
films, resources. For me,

824
00:43:10,431 --> 00:43:14,330
the best of the best resources
are the movies themselves.
Like, I mean I'm such a,

825
00:43:14,350 --> 00:43:18,140
I am such a movie freak,
um, for nonfiction movies,

826
00:43:18,141 --> 00:43:20,840
like if you're watching nonfiction sounds
like my favorite nonfiction film of

827
00:43:20,841 --> 00:43:25,190
all time, which kind of pushed me
to seeing documentaries, excuse me,

828
00:43:25,191 --> 00:43:25,870
seeing documentaries.

829
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:29,240
I was like a viable outlet for
my creativity as I got older was,

830
00:43:29,241 --> 00:43:33,470
it was when I was in college, I saw the
Joe Berlinger and Bruce and off ski film,

831
00:43:33,471 --> 00:43:35,580
Brother's keeper, brother's
keeper, brother's keeper,

832
00:43:35,581 --> 00:43:38,420
which is one of the greatest
films. Everyone, this is
like, it is in New York City.

833
00:43:38,421 --> 00:43:41,630
As you guys can hear. This is what happens
in New York. We get a train going by,

834
00:43:41,631 --> 00:43:43,850
you can hear everything rumbling in
the office. Sounds like an earthquake.

835
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:48,620
It's an earthquake. Like all the glasses
shaking. It'll stop in a second. This is,

836
00:43:48,621 --> 00:43:52,340
this is New York. Um, the, so it's
a film called brother's keeper.

837
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:54,380
And I saw it in a movie theater.
Uh,

838
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:56,000
cause I heard everybody
talking about it and was like,

839
00:43:56,001 --> 00:43:57,080
I have to go see this film.

840
00:43:57,081 --> 00:44:00,050
And it was the first time I think I
probably ever paid to see a movie,

841
00:44:00,051 --> 00:44:03,130
a documentary in a movie
theater. And um, cause I,

842
00:44:03,131 --> 00:44:06,120
I was in film school so we were watching
a lot of docs in school but never been

843
00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:08,840
never gonna actually where I bought
a ticket. And so I bought a ticket,

844
00:44:08,841 --> 00:44:13,580
went to see his film and the film is so
good, it's so dark and it's so creepy.

845
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:17,360
And it's about these three brothers
where one of them is accused,

846
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:18,380
it's an upstate New York.

847
00:44:18,381 --> 00:44:20,780
So it's like these three country
brothers where one of them is accused of

848
00:44:20,781 --> 00:44:22,070
murdering another one.

849
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:26,300
And as it goes on in the trial of the
sky being brought up for murder charges,

850
00:44:26,301 --> 00:44:29,540
that there was like,
there was like incest and it's like,

851
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:32,670
I mean it gets dark and weird and so good,

852
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:34,670
but that's one of his
films were that there's,

853
00:44:34,671 --> 00:44:37,260
there was so many levels of emotion
you feel when you're watching that.

854
00:44:37,261 --> 00:44:38,550
And it was so beautifully shot.

855
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:41,790
And one a years later when I got
to meet Joe and Bruce, I just,

856
00:44:41,791 --> 00:44:45,240
I mean I gushed over them like this movie.
I was like, that movie changed my life.

857
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:48,150
Like it is one of the greatest movies
I've ever seen in my life and I to this

858
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:51,030
day, I mean I'm still such a fan. Like
when I see people, I'm a little fan boy.

859
00:44:51,031 --> 00:44:52,380
When I see somebody that I look up to,

860
00:44:52,381 --> 00:44:55,710
it's like I will go over and just
like and just like cover them with fan

861
00:44:55,711 --> 00:44:59,700
girlness. Yeah. Who else falls in that?

862
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:03,390
I mean Errol Morris is a genius.
Like Errol Morris, Errol Morris,

863
00:45:03,391 --> 00:45:07,770
who is like that guy. His the amazing,
here's the thing about if you,

864
00:45:07,771 --> 00:45:10,540
if you go to Errol Morris Morris's website
arrows, Morris is such a craftsman.

865
00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:14,070
Can you describe who he is and I apologize
them is the Errol Morris did the fog

866
00:45:14,071 --> 00:45:18,660
of war. Errol Errol Morris did
the thin blue line like years ago.

867
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:22,710
Errol Morris was one of the
guys who started putting
like real dramatic produced

868
00:45:22,711 --> 00:45:25,170
recreation's in movies.
Like when he did the thin blue line,

869
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:26,550
people attack to the film.

870
00:45:26,551 --> 00:45:29,250
And this is crazy to think about back
when he made this and whatever 80

871
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,730
something, they're like, this isn't a
documentary. It's like you got real yet.

872
00:45:32,790 --> 00:45:36,990
Yet you fake get actors in there doing
things. You've got stuff that you staged,

873
00:45:36,991 --> 00:45:40,410
you stage things in a movie that's not a
documentary. And when you look at that,

874
00:45:40,411 --> 00:45:43,470
like the movies gorgeous but it,
but it set the tone and it's like,

875
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:48,210
it basically changed what we think of
what a documentary could be. And so, um,

876
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:49,710
you know,
at the same thing happened years later.

877
00:45:49,711 --> 00:45:51,990
I remember when I was on a panel
with Al Maysles and Al Maysles,

878
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:55,350
there's like right when supersize me
came out and Al Maysles told me, he goes,

879
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:58,290
he goes, yeah, what you do, they use
what you do isn't documentary. He goes,

880
00:45:58,291 --> 00:46:00,780
you don't, you don't make
documentaries. And I, and again,

881
00:46:00,781 --> 00:46:02,980
it was like there was a
transformational moment, um,

882
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,030
of I think what people's interpretation
of what a dot could be was why did he

883
00:46:06,031 --> 00:46:10,020
say that? Because he saw it being
like from a first person standpoint,

884
00:46:10,021 --> 00:46:14,820
he didn't see like me telling a first
person story as being a documentary. Um,

885
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:18,760
same thing. He didn't think Michael Moore
made documentaries. Um, and so he's,

886
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:22,320
so that was said that was kind of his
idea. But like Errol Morris, you know,

887
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:23,980
back to this amazing craftsmen,

888
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,390
like his stuff is so beautiful
and if you go to his website,

889
00:46:27,391 --> 00:46:31,260
like how Errol Morris like really pays
the bills as he makes commercials. Um,

890
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:33,120
because there's not, it's not like
we're going out and buying boats,

891
00:46:33,121 --> 00:46:34,500
making documentaries say,
let's be honest.

892
00:46:34,501 --> 00:46:36,910
Like we don't have like a fleet of
Ferraris outside. It's like you,

893
00:46:36,911 --> 00:46:39,510
you make these movies because you
believe in them and what they represent.

894
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:42,960
But if you go to his website, it's like
if I, and I think it's Errol morris.com.

895
00:46:42,961 --> 00:46:44,760
I'm not sure if you go there.
It's like,

896
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:47,610
it has like all these commercials that
he's made and just experiments that he

897
00:46:47,611 --> 00:46:50,860
does with the cameras, which is
awesome. Like, and you see like how he,

898
00:46:50,890 --> 00:46:54,330
he will take somebody crazy commercial
money and do something he's never done.

899
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:55,380
And then once you tries that,

900
00:46:55,381 --> 00:46:58,380
he starts to apply those
tricks and transplant and
transplant it to his movies.

901
00:46:58,381 --> 00:47:02,290
And it's cool. It's so cool to see.
But it's like he's a, he's a talent.

902
00:47:02,291 --> 00:47:03,510
Like I have mad respect for him.

903
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:07,140
And then there's somebody like Steve
James who I think Steve James is just a

904
00:47:07,141 --> 00:47:11,400
great storyteller. Steve James did hoop
dreams. He did Stevie, he did life itself.

905
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:15,810
Um, apart from Steve James
just being an epic human being,

906
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:19,020
like he's a magnificent human, like I'd
say all the time. Like when I grow up,

907
00:47:19,021 --> 00:47:21,210
I want to be Steve James because he's a,

908
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:25,560
he's just a great individual who
treats people well, you know,

909
00:47:25,561 --> 00:47:29,440
his is, you know, we'll return
anybody's phone call, talks anyone,

910
00:47:29,441 --> 00:47:32,550
he's the last guy to leave when students
are asking him questions. You know, I,

911
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:34,890
I really admired that. And
so there's, there's Pete,

912
00:47:34,891 --> 00:47:38,350
things like that that I take from people,
but, but he's also a great filmmaker.

913
00:47:38,370 --> 00:47:40,030
You know,
he really believes in what he does.

914
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:43,150
And so I think when you look at his films
and he's one of those guys who makes

915
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:46,900
movies over years, you know, like he'll
make a movie for like five, seven,

916
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:51,160
eight years and, and that type of
dedication I really, I really look up to.

917
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:55,210
That's a huge commitment. That's right.
And on the, on the point of films,

918
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:57,460
so do,
do you still,

919
00:47:57,490 --> 00:48:01,360
why still make films and the reason I
ask is that when we're talking about

920
00:48:01,361 --> 00:48:04,690
formats and say the future of media,
I think about this quite a lot.

921
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:07,510
There are people who say can create very,

922
00:48:07,511 --> 00:48:12,511
very popular blogs and then get courted
by the big publishers in New York City

923
00:48:12,911 --> 00:48:13,840
and published books.

924
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:18,100
And the book still to this
day for whatever reason,

925
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:23,350
occupies a unique part of mind,
space and human beings.

926
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:27,100
It just carries a level of Gravitas that
is not associated with the Internet.

927
00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:28,750
Right. Quite wrongly, I think. Yeah.

928
00:48:28,810 --> 00:48:32,890
But people can become sort of part of
the cultural zeitgeist and have a real

929
00:48:32,891 --> 00:48:36,670
impact with books in a way that is very
difficult with something that is viewed

930
00:48:36,671 --> 00:48:38,150
as a femoral online.
Yes.

931
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:43,230
Do documentaries still have that in and
maybe it's just something I perceive

932
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:48,010
that difference compared to say TV
or is that, am I making that up? No,

933
00:48:48,011 --> 00:48:50,290
I mean I think that what's happened
though now is there's been a couple of

934
00:48:50,291 --> 00:48:50,861
things that have happened.

935
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:55,300
One on the heels of like Hbo and Netflix
and showtime and especially Netflix

936
00:48:55,301 --> 00:48:55,871
where more people,

937
00:48:55,871 --> 00:48:58,960
I think I've seen the things I've
made on Netflix than anywhere else,

938
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:00,130
which is fantastic.

939
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:03,550
I think that they have created a larger
audience for documentaries than ever

940
00:49:03,551 --> 00:49:04,384
before.

941
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:09,420
And I think that type of hunger is what's
also starting to drive this push into

942
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,950
smarter nonfiction television.
Um,

943
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:14,050
both from a Netflix standpoint
and from a television standpoint.

944
00:49:14,051 --> 00:49:16,360
Because what happened in television
is there were all of these people,

945
00:49:16,990 --> 00:49:19,900
all these networks, and it started
with like FX. It's diverse, diverse.

946
00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:22,480
It was HBO who raised the
Bar for scripted television,

947
00:49:22,481 --> 00:49:25,990
started making scripted television beyond
what any of us thought was possible

948
00:49:25,991 --> 00:49:29,320
for TV. I mean, they just started crushing
it. And so then other people said, well,

949
00:49:29,321 --> 00:49:31,390
we should be creating that level
of television. That's, I mean,

950
00:49:31,410 --> 00:49:34,480
when I was working with FX back in the
day, John Land Graph, brilliant guy,

951
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:38,560
one of the smartest PV people you'll
ever meet in your life, um, said this.

952
00:49:38,561 --> 00:49:42,250
That's what we like. We want to be naive
to HBO for, for Commercial Television.

953
00:49:42,251 --> 00:49:43,210
And that's what he created.

954
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:46,780
Like he was the champion that made that
and raise that bar for FX. And then,

955
00:49:46,781 --> 00:49:50,200
you know, then showtime did. And now
if you look across the spectrum of TV,

956
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:54,070
every network has at least one
amazing show. Like USA has Mr. Robot,

957
00:49:54,071 --> 00:49:56,950
which is spectacular. Like every, you go
down the line, everybody's got one big,

958
00:49:56,980 --> 00:50:00,730
big fiction show,
but nobody had smart nonfiction.

959
00:50:00,731 --> 00:50:03,270
Everybody kind of left that down here.
It was lowest common denominators.

960
00:50:03,271 --> 00:50:05,770
So while the rising tide lifted
all the ships for fiction,

961
00:50:05,890 --> 00:50:09,130
it didn't happen for nonfiction.
And now people are realizing as,

962
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:12,580
as they're abandoning ship with these
all these crappy TV shows that were

963
00:50:12,581 --> 00:50:13,414
missing the boat.

964
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:16,990
There's higher expectations from our
audience and now they're starting to push

965
00:50:16,991 --> 00:50:18,970
that, you know, as HBO did
with the Genx. And again,

966
00:50:18,971 --> 00:50:22,120
HBO leading the charge of Let shanks
was great. It was fantastic. They said,

967
00:50:22,121 --> 00:50:26,710
let's show people that you can make
smarter nonfiction, dark, dark, so dark.

968
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:27,650
And so there was that,

969
00:50:27,651 --> 00:50:30,680
there was making a murderer on
Netflix and now everybody's like, oh,

970
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:33,110
people want to see smart non fiction.
We should be doing that.

971
00:50:33,710 --> 00:50:37,910
Which is great for us. It's great for
people like Alex. Give me, um, who's, uh,

972
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,260
Alex give me who did smartest Enron.
Smartest guys in the room. Yeah,

973
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:46,280
he did the Scientology movie going clear,
going clear. Oh God, another creepy one.

974
00:50:46,310 --> 00:50:48,470
Alex, he's, he's a great person
I should talk to on the podcast.

975
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:50,060
He's an amazing filmmaker.
And again,

976
00:50:50,061 --> 00:50:53,570
somebody I really look up to because I
think he's, he's incredibly cerebral,

977
00:50:53,571 --> 00:50:55,100
very smart. That was a, I mean,

978
00:50:55,101 --> 00:51:00,101
the amount of data crunching and just
review required to make going clear was so

979
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:04,910
evident. Threat in the making.
And the thing about it, and he's,

980
00:51:04,911 --> 00:51:09,500
he is a deep researcher and I
really, I, I think he's fantastic.

981
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:10,580
But,
uh,

982
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:13,160
but it's one of the things that for people
like us who have been kind of living

983
00:51:13,161 --> 00:51:15,140
in the space and making this
type of conduct for a long time,

984
00:51:15,141 --> 00:51:18,800
it's fantastic because now it just opens
up and broadens the spectrum. So for me,

985
00:51:18,801 --> 00:51:22,370
I feel like there's still a place to
make movies and, and then there's,

986
00:51:22,371 --> 00:51:24,860
now there's a, now there's
more places to make smarter TV,

987
00:51:24,890 --> 00:51:26,210
which I think is really exciting.

988
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:31,590
What do you think you will be few
head to speculate. What do you, what,

989
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:35,960
what do you think you'll be creating
an five or t three, five or 10 years,

990
00:51:35,961 --> 00:51:36,820
whichever we're,

991
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:39,960
we're about to start doing some
really awesome VR projects like that.

992
00:51:39,961 --> 00:51:43,550
It'll be this year we're going to be
doing some incredible stuff. We've, we've,

993
00:51:43,551 --> 00:51:46,640
we've held back for, I didn't want
it to kind of jump in early, um,

994
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:49,070
as everybody else is kind of jumping
on the Vr bandwagon. And we've been,

995
00:51:49,071 --> 00:51:52,340
we've been smart about what we've been
navigating through and the projects that

996
00:51:52,341 --> 00:51:53,270
we want to make.
And so that's,

997
00:51:53,271 --> 00:51:55,860
that's going to be something
that's going to be real. And,

998
00:51:55,970 --> 00:51:59,870
and I think that VR has the ability
to become an empathy machine.

999
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:03,230
I think it has the ability to put you
in places and experience things and

1000
00:52:03,231 --> 00:52:05,990
feelings in a way you never have before.
Um,

1001
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:10,700
so that's super exciting for
me as somebody who believes
that you can actually,

1002
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:11,810
you know,

1003
00:52:11,810 --> 00:52:14,570
start to chip away and make the world
a better place with entertainment.

1004
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:14,781
You know,

1005
00:52:14,781 --> 00:52:19,070
I think movies and TV shows have a
profound impact on our belief system and I

1006
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:21,740
think that, uh, there's just something we
can do there. So for me, I think that's,

1007
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,720
that's where it will be. I
think we'll be doing, I mean,

1008
00:52:23,721 --> 00:52:27,980
it's in five years probably won't
be exactly five, maybe closer to 10,

1009
00:52:27,981 --> 00:52:30,050
but there's going to be one
pipe that delivers everything.

1010
00:52:30,110 --> 00:52:32,510
There's gonna be one pipe where I watch
everything, whether it's on my TV,

1011
00:52:32,511 --> 00:52:37,430
at home, I'm on my, on my tablet, on
my phone. It'll be everywhere. I mean,

1012
00:52:37,431 --> 00:52:38,690
one pipe that feeds everything.

1013
00:52:38,691 --> 00:52:41,900
And that's going to be an exciting
time for a couple reasons because now

1014
00:52:41,901 --> 00:52:44,600
anything I want to see is suddenly going
to be right at my fingertips, wherever,

1015
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:47,000
whenever, wherever, I'll be
able to watch anything awesome.

1016
00:52:47,390 --> 00:52:49,280
But simultaneously you're
going to be to the point of,

1017
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:53,510
still back to the Youtube effication of
our viewing habits, where, how do now,

1018
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:56,270
how do you now bring eyeballs?
How do you let people know it's there?

1019
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:58,790
And I think that's the next step.
You know, there were three stages of,

1020
00:52:58,791 --> 00:53:01,610
of real shifts in entertainment
that I think were big.

1021
00:53:01,611 --> 00:53:04,430
And one of the first one really helped
me because it made supersize me possible.

1022
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:07,010
And there was like this
democratization of production,

1023
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:10,880
democratization of cinema where suddenly
anyone with a camera and a computer and

1024
00:53:10,881 --> 00:53:13,850
a good idea could make
a movie that was huge.

1025
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:16,530
So now suddenly everybody
had access to the tools. Um,

1026
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:17,960
you could put in the sweat equity,

1027
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:20,690
you can make something really cheaply and
easily get it out for the world to see.

1028
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:23,780
Next was kind of this democratization of
distribution where now I didn't need to

1029
00:53:23,781 --> 00:53:26,370
have, you know, Sony or or,

1030
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:30,360
or paramount put out a movie and a
movie theater. I can put it online now.

1031
00:53:30,361 --> 00:53:32,560
Anybody in the world could have
access to my content, you know,

1032
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:35,730
via youtube or via Vimeo.
But now how do you get people to see it?

1033
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,980
That's the problem. So it's
out there, but it's invisible.

1034
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:42,030
Now comes the next big step, which
will be huge as the pipelines converge,

1035
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,490
which is almost like this
democratization of curation,

1036
00:53:44,491 --> 00:53:46,050
this democratization of marketing,

1037
00:53:46,170 --> 00:53:50,570
how to now we point people towards what
matters and that's where it's going to

1038
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:52,200
be.
Influencers are gonna be people like you.

1039
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:56,850
It's going to be people like me who
people trust and those voices are going to

1040
00:53:56,851 --> 00:54:00,480
be even more resonant as we move forward
because people are going to trust in

1041
00:54:00,481 --> 00:54:03,180
them even with even more,
I think importance

1042
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:07,010
here. Here. Yeah, I agree.

1043
00:54:07,011 --> 00:54:12,011
I was a VR skeptic until I had a demo
with the HTC vive running valve software

1044
00:54:15,230 --> 00:54:20,230
in Seattle where I was fully kitted out
and in maybe a 20 by 20 foot space and

1045
00:54:20,810 --> 00:54:24,500
where you can walk around, we can walk
around else come up yet. Oh God. And what,

1046
00:54:24,501 --> 00:54:29,060
just what struck me as
someone who for a long,

1047
00:54:29,090 --> 00:54:30,950
long time listeners to this podcast know,

1048
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:34,640
maybe I may or may not have dabbled in
various types of plant medicine or other

1049
00:54:34,641 --> 00:54:35,474
molecules,

1050
00:54:36,050 --> 00:54:40,670
the time distortion that I
experienced in that immersive Vr,

1051
00:54:40,671 --> 00:54:45,671
which is still model t by comparison
looking towards say what's going to exist

1052
00:54:45,681 --> 00:54:49,280
three years from now. Yeah. I thought
I was in for five or six. No, no.

1053
00:54:49,281 --> 00:54:52,400
I thought I was in for five or six minutes
and I was in for almost 25 minutes.

1054
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:54,740
Wow. And I, that's when I was like, okay,

1055
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:58,370
there is something really
fundamental going on. Yeah.

1056
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:00,740
And you said this empathy machine,
I mean,

1057
00:55:00,741 --> 00:55:04,000
just like the simulacrum and uh,

1058
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:09,220
the ability to elicit emotion is so
far beyond anything coming from a flat

1059
00:55:09,891 --> 00:55:12,920
screen. That's right. It
was just mind blowing. Yeah.

1060
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:16,890
It was just that I was just at Google
this past week and meeting with their VR

1061
00:55:16,891 --> 00:55:19,740
guys and seeing some of the
stuff they're working on and you,

1062
00:55:19,741 --> 00:55:21,750
it's like you're in the matrix.
Like suddenly it's like,

1063
00:55:21,751 --> 00:55:25,410
it's the closest thing I could imagine
to suddenly being neo and taking the pill

1064
00:55:25,411 --> 00:55:29,430
and being thrust into the machine that,
that, that I could. And it's, I mean,

1065
00:55:29,431 --> 00:55:32,510
what's coming is incredibly exciting.
Yeah.

1066
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:35,940
And it just as and as a and as a content
creator and as a storyteller to it just

1067
00:55:35,941 --> 00:55:39,960
makes you realize we've barely begun to
scratch the surface of what's possible.

1068
00:55:40,050 --> 00:55:43,500
Like it is, as you said, it's a
model t like it is so early and it's,

1069
00:55:43,501 --> 00:55:47,100
that excites me. Like we've always been
a very early adopter of technology. I,

1070
00:55:47,101 --> 00:55:48,090
you know,
we've always been,

1071
00:55:48,091 --> 00:55:50,010
we've always tried to be a
little ahead of the curve and,

1072
00:55:50,170 --> 00:55:52,710
and what we use the tools we use
to tell stories. And so for me,

1073
00:55:52,711 --> 00:55:54,120
I think this is going to be incredible.

1074
00:55:54,670 --> 00:55:58,750
Which filmmakers out there do you feel
are pushing the envelope in terms of

1075
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:02,740
technology or innovations in the space?

1076
00:56:02,741 --> 00:56:05,440
Because I know Vibey for instance like
James Cameron and his cameras phenomena.

1077
00:56:05,441 --> 00:56:06,380
I mean James Cameron I think

1078
00:56:06,410 --> 00:56:08,630
invented the camera that
he used on the last movie.

1079
00:56:08,631 --> 00:56:12,290
Like it was him and his partner created
the pace camera and camera to use on

1080
00:56:12,291 --> 00:56:16,250
Avatar. Like they changed the whole
box that made that movie. It's bonkers.

1081
00:56:16,251 --> 00:56:21,110
He invented the technology
that created like the, the the,

1082
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:24,980
what was it like the chrome, the chrome
cop in terminator two because, no,

1083
00:56:24,990 --> 00:56:27,460
but everybody's like we can't do this.
And He's like I'll fund it myself.

1084
00:56:27,490 --> 00:56:28,820
And what's,
what's so cool about that?

1085
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:31,270
Creating like a storm to
basically do that technology.

1086
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:34,150
Which a correct me if I'm wrong,
cause you'd be the person to correct me.

1087
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:37,990
That the abyss,
which I enjoyed but was not,

1088
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:42,070
I understand the commercial success is
where he honed that technology that later

1089
00:56:42,071 --> 00:56:46,030
enabled him to, to create the use it in
terminator two. That's exactly right.

1090
00:56:46,090 --> 00:56:47,500
Which is such an awesome story.

1091
00:56:47,530 --> 00:56:49,360
And it was out of that yet cause
it was out of that where he,

1092
00:56:49,361 --> 00:56:51,760
that's where he got the idea of what
could happen with this other character.

1093
00:56:51,761 --> 00:56:55,150
And what it could be. And He poured all
his own money into making that a reality,

1094
00:56:55,151 --> 00:56:58,420
which I love. I mean, I'm
somebody who fly. I mean,

1095
00:56:58,421 --> 00:57:01,720
I'm a real believer that you should
always bet on yourself first and pre.

1096
00:57:01,721 --> 00:57:04,600
When we made supersize
me, I remember I was, uh,

1097
00:57:05,050 --> 00:57:06,580
because this was right when we sold our,

1098
00:57:06,581 --> 00:57:08,920
showed MTV the first show we
created online when, you know,

1099
00:57:08,921 --> 00:57:12,460
from the interactive consortium when we
had that company, because here's the con.

1100
00:57:12,461 --> 00:57:15,070
So when we created the first show we
created under the con was a show called,

1101
00:57:15,071 --> 00:57:15,904
I bet you will.

1102
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:19,600
And so we sold that show to CBS and
then to MTV and then nine 11 happened.

1103
00:57:19,630 --> 00:57:21,430
So we had proof of concept,
we proved that we create,

1104
00:57:21,431 --> 00:57:23,320
could create programming
online in spring boarded off.

1105
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:26,590
So we created the first show to really
go from the web to television as a series

1106
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:29,440
sold at the MTV. Then nine 11
happened. Everything stopped.

1107
00:57:29,441 --> 00:57:33,040
Like production just came to a stand still
in New York City. So we had no money.

1108
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:34,720
I was evicted from my apartment.

1109
00:57:34,721 --> 00:57:37,050
I was sleeping in a hammock in
my office that was so that's,

1110
00:57:37,051 --> 00:57:39,160
so every morning I would get up and
go to the gym around the corner,

1111
00:57:39,161 --> 00:57:41,050
The New York sports club
to like shower and workout.

1112
00:57:41,110 --> 00:57:43,720
I was in great shape because it
says I didn't have a choice. Um,

1113
00:57:43,721 --> 00:57:46,000
and that would come back
to my office and we had,

1114
00:57:46,090 --> 00:57:48,640
I still have people coming to work and
to make sure that they could pay their

1115
00:57:48,641 --> 00:57:50,260
rent and pay their bills.

1116
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:53,500
I took out credit cards and so I was
basically paying their rent with credit

1117
00:57:53,501 --> 00:57:55,180
cards. I was paying their
bills with credit cards.

1118
00:57:55,181 --> 00:57:58,720
I was paying credit cards with credit
cards and I amassed about a quarter of a

1119
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:03,370
million dollars in credit card debt,
um, in, in about a year. Wow. And so,

1120
00:58:03,430 --> 00:58:06,550
but I still had an office and I still had
a business and I was like, I'm not, as,

1121
00:58:06,551 --> 00:58:08,560
I was like, you know, I'm,
I'm still betting on us.

1122
00:58:08,890 --> 00:58:12,760
And so that's when MTV green
with the series and we did
53 episodes of that show.

1123
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:16,570
And during that time I paid off
like $50,000 worth of that debt.

1124
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:19,120
And then when they cancelled it,
I had another 50 grand in the bank.

1125
00:58:19,121 --> 00:58:19,511
And I was like,
well,

1126
00:58:19,511 --> 00:58:23,650
I can either pour this $50,000 into that
bottomless pit of debt or we can make a

1127
00:58:23,651 --> 00:58:26,110
movie because we owned all the
equipment. Again, is the same thing.

1128
00:58:26,111 --> 00:58:27,940
We had the cameras, we have the
computers, let's make a film.

1129
00:58:28,090 --> 00:58:31,470
And that film was supersize me and it
changed everything. Oh Wow. Yeah. So I,

1130
00:58:31,471 --> 00:58:32,950
so that's why I mean like James Cameras,

1131
00:58:32,951 --> 00:58:36,370
when those people that I really look at
and admire because he will always bet on

1132
00:58:36,371 --> 00:58:38,340
him and he'll always bet on his ability.

1133
00:58:38,370 --> 00:58:41,830
If you haven't read the New Yorker
article about James Cameron when he was

1134
00:58:41,831 --> 00:58:46,480
making, um, when he was making
Avatar, not only is he a genius,

1135
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:50,020
but he also is a bit of a bully and says
like some terrible things to people who

1136
00:58:50,021 --> 00:58:50,854
work for him.

1137
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:54,520
There's some of the greatest lines that
you'll ever hear him say to human beings,

1138
00:58:54,670 --> 00:58:57,940
which there's a guy who's like rigging
lights. Um, and he says to the guy,

1139
00:58:57,941 --> 00:59:01,060
and he goes watching you lights,
like watching a monkey fuck a football.

1140
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:05,890
And he yells to another guy, he's like,
hiring you is like firing too good men.

1141
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:09,640
It's like, ouch. Some of
the lines are phenomenal.

1142
00:59:09,641 --> 00:59:12,790
It's like I read that and I worked with,
but he was a thing. But it's like, I mean,

1143
00:59:12,791 --> 00:59:16,540
pardon me is, he may be saying this
and I worked with a guy years ago, um,

1144
00:59:16,541 --> 00:59:21,010
a guy named gene Licht who ran a printing
shop back when I was in college and

1145
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:24,770
worked for, I worked for gene
through a friend of mine at Nyu, um,

1146
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:26,120
who worked there,
ran the print shop.

1147
00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:29,960
And so I would go to this print shop
and gene was one of those guys who would

1148
00:59:29,961 --> 00:59:33,080
basically yell and scream at the top
of his lungs and say terrible insulting

1149
00:59:33,081 --> 00:59:33,861
things that I thought.

1150
00:59:33,861 --> 00:59:37,610
I thought it was spectacularly funny
and really entertaining and um,

1151
00:59:37,670 --> 00:59:40,880
and so for me, but I also think
he did it in jest to be funny,

1152
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,460
even though he was mean about it.
But he was also saying it in jest also.

1153
00:59:43,461 --> 00:59:46,400
Make other people laugh, which I feel like
James Cameron is doing the same thing,

1154
00:59:46,430 --> 00:59:50,360
but it's a, so gene, you know, rest in
peace. He was a, he was a phenomenal guy.

1155
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:54,350
James, uh, this is a quick side note.

1156
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:57,680
I remember it down the podcast. He
hasn't, I would love to do with him.

1157
00:59:57,681 --> 00:59:58,520
I've met him once.

1158
00:59:58,521 --> 01:00:03,521
I went on the zero gravity like zero g
flight where the the like the payload was

1159
01:00:03,771 --> 01:00:04,461
ridiculous.

1160
01:00:04,461 --> 01:00:07,910
I mean if we're really fortunate the plane
didn't go down cause it was like Elon

1161
01:00:07,910 --> 01:00:11,280
Musk, James Cameron, like you go down
the list. It was nuts. Amazing. And uh,

1162
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:16,070
I had a chance to get some schwag
advertise Schwag because it was a,

1163
01:00:16,071 --> 01:00:16,904
it was uh,
I,

1164
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:21,920
I obviously I paid for the flight and
brought a reader along actually who want

1165
01:00:22,821 --> 01:00:24,020
some type of competition I'd thrown.

1166
01:00:24,350 --> 01:00:28,940
And we all got tee shirts that
had been given to the staff, uh,

1167
01:00:28,970 --> 01:00:33,140
and the crew working on Avatar. And
this shirt was great. The shirt said,

1168
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:34,910
and I might be getting
this slightly wrong,

1169
01:00:34,911 --> 01:00:38,510
but it was in huge font right across
the check and it's a chest. It said,

1170
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:43,490
hope is not a strategy, luck is not
a factor. Failure is not an option.

1171
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:47,960
Hyphen James Cameron. It was like, wow.

1172
01:00:48,370 --> 01:00:52,910
It's like setting the tone,
setting the tone for production.

1173
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:56,990
And I wore that shirt when I
was reading the four hour body,

1174
01:00:56,991 --> 01:01:00,410
which just about killed me
literally and figuratively.

1175
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:05,540
But one experience. Yeah. And it's,
you know, it's like, is there anybody,

1176
01:01:05,570 --> 01:01:09,770
you know,
who is that exacting and forward thinking?

1177
01:01:09,771 --> 01:01:13,430
Who is it brutal in some respect? I
mean I think, no, cause, pardon me,

1178
01:01:13,431 --> 01:01:16,310
it feels like you have to be so steadfast
in your belief. You have to go to,

1179
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:19,340
if you don't drink the Koolaid,
nobody drinks the Kool aid. Um,

1180
01:01:19,370 --> 01:01:22,040
I mean it's got to be, who's the
other person that's probably in that,

1181
01:01:22,070 --> 01:01:23,120
in that same type of state?

1182
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:26,150
Like Kanye is Kanye there and I meet
Connie is probably aren't even a different

1183
01:01:26,151 --> 01:01:28,040
level than like James Cameron,
but,

1184
01:01:28,130 --> 01:01:32,750
but comparable I think and kind of
maybe a mega, mega maniacal way. Um,

1185
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:36,590
but I think that, uh, I think you have
to, you have to believe in you first.

1186
01:01:36,650 --> 01:01:41,270
Toray um, the, who's the, he's
a great writer. I'm commentator.

1187
01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:44,660
Uh, was, did, he told me the story
where he went to Connie's house once.

1188
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:49,190
And so he's in Connie's house and inside
Connie's house there's a big giant

1189
01:01:49,490 --> 01:01:53,630
poster of Kanye,
like right inside the living room.

1190
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:57,590
And so it's a Tory said to him,
he goes, um, he goes, Kanye,

1191
01:01:57,591 --> 01:02:02,150
why do you have a giant
picture of you on the wall?

1192
01:02:02,690 --> 01:02:06,890
And he goes, well, I got to cheer for
me before anyone else can cheer for me.

1193
01:02:07,550 --> 01:02:11,720
And I was like, there's some fantastic
logic and that's actually a good response.

1194
01:02:11,870 --> 01:02:15,080
Good logic.
I don't know if I can stomach the grief.

1195
01:02:15,081 --> 01:02:18,450
I would get for putting a huge,
like Tim Ferris posters herself,

1196
01:02:18,590 --> 01:02:19,990
like Burt Reynolds centerfold,

1197
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:23,490
kind of. And if you've ever seen white
chicks, there's this one, Terry crews.

1198
01:02:24,270 --> 01:02:27,620
I don't know if my friends will
let me get away with that. Well,

1199
01:02:27,710 --> 01:02:29,100
as you come into my
office and there's like,

1200
01:02:29,130 --> 01:02:31,650
there's like posters of the
films that I've made the wall.

1201
01:02:31,651 --> 01:02:34,080
So it's like those are my, that's
my guess. My con you moment.

1202
01:02:34,110 --> 01:02:38,550
Got to cheer for yourself first. I know
we only have a few more minutes. Sure.

1203
01:02:39,810 --> 01:02:42,380
Just a couple more questions and then
hopefully we'll do a round two sometime.

1204
01:02:42,390 --> 01:02:46,200
But the, I'm not going to go through
all my usual rapidfire questions,

1205
01:02:46,201 --> 01:02:50,070
but one I would love to ask is what is
the book that you have gifted most to

1206
01:02:50,071 --> 01:02:50,904
other people?

1207
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:55,020
Oh, um, I tell you what
though, there was a,

1208
01:02:55,290 --> 01:02:59,040
I gave the Bhagavad Gita to
a lot of people. Um, yeah,

1209
01:02:59,220 --> 01:03:00,570
this was right after,

1210
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:05,010
I guess it would have been
right after my son was born.

1211
01:03:05,011 --> 01:03:08,400
And then right after I got divorced,
somebody gave it to me.

1212
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:11,850
Andy and I got a lot out of it. And
then again, it's, there's been multiple,

1213
01:03:11,851 --> 01:03:16,560
multiple interpretations, multiple
writings of it. Um, um, but, uh,

1214
01:03:17,070 --> 01:03:19,920
there was one in particular
interpretation. I can't
remember who the writer was.

1215
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:24,210
Um, the guy who basically did this, this
translation, but I gave that book to,

1216
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:25,770
I don't know,
a couple dozen people

1217
01:03:25,870 --> 01:03:28,600
who they like. Yeah. I'm just like, tell
him I'm having a hard time right now.

1218
01:03:28,601 --> 01:03:30,400
I don't know what to do. And I was
like, you should read this book.

1219
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:34,540
This is one of these books that has come
up so many times in my life that I have

1220
01:03:34,541 --> 01:03:37,570
not yet read. So this might be the final
I'm going to, I'm going to send you,

1221
01:03:37,571 --> 01:03:41,010
I'm going to send you the translation
that I read. Cool. Yeah, I appreciate it.

1222
01:03:41,011 --> 01:03:44,550
It's, it's kind of like the tout
ditching. It's like I put it off for,

1223
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:45,430
I didn't put it off.

1224
01:03:45,431 --> 01:03:49,270
It just never took the step to read
it for decades and decades. Cool.

1225
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:52,430
This is good. This is a nudge
that I need. And, uh, we,

1226
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:55,900
we talked about technology earlier.
You have a lot of irons in the fire.

1227
01:03:56,410 --> 01:04:00,360
Would you like to tell people about what
you're up to in, in the tech space? Um,

1228
01:04:00,470 --> 01:04:03,140
yeah, so we, uh, this is,
this is a great thing.

1229
01:04:03,141 --> 01:04:07,510
I was just out at Jason Calacanis launch
in San Francisco where we give it,

1230
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:08,360
we had a,

1231
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:12,530
we had a company that had been in his
incubator slash accelerator for the last

1232
01:04:12,531 --> 01:04:16,660
four months called collect. And this
is a company that you can go to it,

1233
01:04:16,670 --> 01:04:18,980
you can go to [inaudible] dot com where
you can download the apps in the iTunes

1234
01:04:18,981 --> 01:04:23,300
store, but it's a, it's a, a company that
is held as you would expect l e c t got.

1235
01:04:23,310 --> 01:04:27,260
Yeah. Yeah. So it's the whole
genesis of this and what it is.

1236
01:04:27,261 --> 01:04:31,490
It's basically like a geek collectible
marketplace. So anything that is geek,

1237
01:04:31,491 --> 01:04:34,060
anything that you would imagine at
comicon that you love from, you know,

1238
01:04:34,061 --> 01:04:36,740
walking dead to whatever, you
know, posters to action figures,

1239
01:04:36,741 --> 01:04:40,220
whatever those geeky things you
love. Vinyl. Like I collect a lot of,

1240
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:43,430
a lot of like uh, um,
like vinyl characters,

1241
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:47,980
characters made by pop artists.
So anything, no matter what it is,

1242
01:04:47,981 --> 01:04:51,890
is that you can like find it on collect.
And so I was being chased by,

1243
01:04:51,891 --> 01:04:54,280
I was finishing a movie in London
and the founder of the company,

1244
01:04:54,281 --> 01:04:57,290
this Guy Steve Bromwell was
chasing me, chasing me, chasing me.

1245
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:00,770
And he finally said a, and
I said, what is it? He goes,

1246
01:05:00,771 --> 01:05:02,060
you're the only person
that's going to get this.

1247
01:05:02,061 --> 01:05:03,500
Like you'll understand
in a couple of years ago,

1248
01:05:03,501 --> 01:05:06,140
I made a movie with Stanley
and Joss Wheaton about comicon.

1249
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:09,680
And then two years before that I made
the Simpsons 20th anniversary special for

1250
01:05:09,681 --> 01:05:14,180
Fox. Like, so I'm, I'm like a geek to
core into my core. Um, and so I said,

1251
01:05:14,181 --> 01:05:16,550
what does it show it to me? So he showed
me just like a flip deck of what it was.

1252
01:05:16,551 --> 01:05:18,730
And I was like, I love
this. And so we sat down,

1253
01:05:18,731 --> 01:05:20,800
we talked about the company I
came on board is one of the,

1254
01:05:20,830 --> 01:05:23,740
one of the founders early on,
um, put money into the company.

1255
01:05:23,740 --> 01:05:26,140
And it's one of those where I just,
I believe in this like of the,

1256
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:29,560
what is it to think? It's $18
billion a year that's spent on Ebay.

1257
01:05:29,561 --> 01:05:33,340
A third of that 6 billion is everything
that lives within this Keke space.

1258
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:37,390
So I think there's a great place to give
people a better experience where you

1259
01:05:37,391 --> 01:05:40,150
can actually have a geek too,
geek experience. So there's a,

1260
01:05:40,151 --> 01:05:43,490
there's kind of a great
social atmosphere to it. Um,

1261
01:05:43,510 --> 01:05:46,990
but then there's also the ability to buy,
to sell, to trade with fellow geeks and,

1262
01:05:46,991 --> 01:05:47,710
and you know,

1263
01:05:47,710 --> 01:05:49,720
feel like you're actually getting
something you love because that's,

1264
01:05:49,770 --> 01:05:50,410
that's awesome.

1265
01:05:50,410 --> 01:05:54,280
Do you have any particular
favorite categories or items
that you've seen on the

1266
01:05:54,281 --> 01:05:56,080
site? Oh my gosh, there's so much fan art.

1267
01:05:56,110 --> 01:05:58,990
Like there's so much stuff that people
create on their own, which is awesome.

1268
01:05:59,140 --> 01:06:02,410
And so I love seeing the stuff that
people draw on their own posters.

1269
01:06:02,410 --> 01:06:06,940
They create a, it's, it's spectacular. So
for me, I love seeing things like that.

1270
01:06:07,270 --> 01:06:07,721
Um,

1271
01:06:07,721 --> 01:06:10,510
I love the people who have stuff that's
still in the original packaging that's

1272
01:06:10,511 --> 01:06:11,940
been on their shelves since like 19.

1273
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:15,400
Some people have like original star wars
toys from like when you and I were kids,

1274
01:06:15,401 --> 01:06:18,220
it's still in original packaging
and like that's, that is dedication.

1275
01:06:18,221 --> 01:06:21,640
A lot of decades. A lot of self control
to, even when I was a little kid,

1276
01:06:21,641 --> 01:06:24,520
I still have all my old stuff like
original star wars toys. Yeah.

1277
01:06:24,550 --> 01:06:28,510
But like the heads are not on the hands
always got chewed off because it was a

1278
01:06:28,511 --> 01:06:30,190
little animal. Yeah. Like I still have,

1279
01:06:30,191 --> 01:06:33,910
like I have my original Darth Vader carry
case that's in my kid's room with that

1280
01:06:33,911 --> 01:06:37,090
I wouldn't let him play with for years
until like last year when I knew he

1281
01:06:37,091 --> 01:06:38,600
wouldn't totally like junk all the toys.

1282
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:43,300
So now he can actually play with the
action figures. So Click C l e c t.com.

1283
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:46,890
Correct. Yeah. And so, uh,
yeah, we just went through,
we just went through like our,

1284
01:06:46,891 --> 01:06:49,780
our kind of seed round. It's, it's,
it's exciting. It's a cool thing.

1285
01:06:49,781 --> 01:06:53,230
And it's like I love having had
my first startup, which I started,

1286
01:06:53,231 --> 01:06:56,350
you know what it was that 16 years ago
and was going around and doing all the

1287
01:06:56,351 --> 01:06:57,520
angel meetings back then.

1288
01:06:57,550 --> 01:07:00,130
I mean for me it was exciting to kind
of be back in that space. And it is,

1289
01:07:00,131 --> 01:07:03,850
it is a very similar hustle to
raising money for movies. Um,

1290
01:07:03,940 --> 01:07:04,661
you're just talking to,

1291
01:07:04,661 --> 01:07:07,780
I think a lot smarter people like with
the people that live and breathe in that

1292
01:07:07,781 --> 01:07:09,540
space are blue or people
who pretend to be.

1293
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:12,370
That's right. That's true. That's true.
You meet, you meet a lot of them as well.

1294
01:07:15,060 --> 01:07:18,310
Okay. Last, last question
before we wrap for this.

1295
01:07:18,340 --> 01:07:22,740
This round one is if you could put a
billboard anywhere with anything on it,

1296
01:07:23,220 --> 01:07:25,740
not an advertisement necessarily
for anything you're doing,

1297
01:07:26,010 --> 01:07:29,850
what would you put on it? Um, oh.
I feel like right now it has to,

1298
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:33,900
it would have to be a, has to be
something Trump related. Right now I just,

1299
01:07:33,930 --> 01:07:35,940
I would, I would have to
have something with like his,

1300
01:07:35,941 --> 01:07:39,990
with his tiny little hands and remind
people what that means when he gets to the

1301
01:07:39,990 --> 01:07:41,880
White House. Do you want these
little hands on the button?

1302
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:43,193
I feel like I want to be,

1303
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:50,460
do you want these puckered lips
yelling at foreign dignitaries?

1304
01:07:50,461 --> 01:07:53,460
Do all these little hands on
the button. Oh, please. God,

1305
01:07:54,930 --> 01:07:59,790
it's, it's becoming for reals right now.
It's, it's unbelievable. Yeah. I mean,

1306
01:07:59,850 --> 01:08:04,130
I'm in all, I'm speechless. I'm absolutely
speech. I feel like, I feel like it's, I,

1307
01:08:04,131 --> 01:08:06,390
it is, it takes a lot to make
Morgan Spurlock speechless,

1308
01:08:06,490 --> 01:08:08,940
but I feel like I'm in the middle of a
reality show. You're watching. It's like,

1309
01:08:08,941 --> 01:08:10,140
how is this actually happening?

1310
01:08:10,350 --> 01:08:14,960
I don't understand all this is happening.
Oh, good golly, Miss Molly. Yes, it was,

1311
01:08:15,470 --> 01:08:20,040
dude, these are, these are
scary, desperate and surreal
times that we live in. A,

1312
01:08:20,150 --> 01:08:25,010
where can people find you on line? Learn
more about you. Say Hello on social,

1313
01:08:25,460 --> 01:08:29,500
on Facebook, on, which is just, you know
me, it's a Morgan Spurlock. Then on,

1314
01:08:29,590 --> 01:08:34,580
on Twitter at Morgan Spurlock. Uh,
Instagram's at Morgan Spurlock NYC.

1315
01:08:34,630 --> 01:08:38,240
Um, snapchat. You'll be able to track
me down. I'm all over. I'm all over the,

1316
01:08:38,330 --> 01:08:40,120
all over the social media,
all over the interwebs.

1317
01:08:40,130 --> 01:08:43,340
So the interweb which do you tend to
eat? What is your primary, would you,

1318
01:08:43,341 --> 01:08:46,190
if I'm on Twitter all the time because
Twitter has become my newsfeed,

1319
01:08:46,220 --> 01:08:47,900
like Twitter is my AP exactly.

1320
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:50,810
Like I'm on Twitter all day long
and it's just constant updates.

1321
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:53,210
I use it in the same way. Yeah.
And I love that. It's like,

1322
01:08:53,211 --> 01:08:55,670
it is a constant new source. Um, we're,

1323
01:08:55,671 --> 01:08:57,920
I'll check in to other newspapers
along the day. Like, you know,

1324
01:08:57,921 --> 01:09:01,350
y'all check in with the times and, or
like, you know, talking points memo or,

1325
01:09:01,351 --> 01:09:02,870
or the New York Post or whatever.

1326
01:09:02,871 --> 01:09:06,030
Cause New York post is spectacular and
you have to, um, but I feel better,

1327
01:09:06,050 --> 01:09:09,440
but it'd be like the Twitter I'm, I'm
on, I'm on on Twitter all day long,

1328
01:09:09,441 --> 01:09:14,190
five like eight, nine, 12 times at Morgan
Sperlock at Morgan Spurlock. And uh,

1329
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:16,670
I'll give you just since
we're talking about tech,

1330
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:18,380
one tip that I found really useful,

1331
01:09:18,381 --> 01:09:23,270
which is a service called Nuzzel and use
the z e l, uh, made by friend of mine,

1332
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:28,300
which effectively looks for patterns
among the people you follow.

1333
01:09:30,290 --> 01:09:31,071
And it will take,

1334
01:09:31,071 --> 01:09:36,071
say the top five stories that are being
spread and pushed out by the people you

1335
01:09:36,141 --> 01:09:38,900
already follow. That's awesome.
Create a digest for you that smart.

1336
01:09:38,901 --> 01:09:39,950
So it's a really,

1337
01:09:39,980 --> 01:09:42,710
really cool service that I'm
surprised Twitter didn't make itself.

1338
01:09:42,711 --> 01:09:44,570
You're saying I should stop
following Kim Kardashians?

1339
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:48,940
Well it depends. Yeah, it depends
on who else you're following.

1340
01:09:48,941 --> 01:09:51,670
I guess you might want to stop calling
all of the Kardashians. That's right.

1341
01:09:54,910 --> 01:09:59,340
Great Fun. A really fun to hang
out and to be continued into.

1342
01:09:59,380 --> 01:10:02,710
Everybody listening, of course show notes,

01:10:44,281 --> 01:10:47,760
It could include Gizmos and gadgets
and all sorts of weird shit that I've

1356
01:10:47,761 --> 01:10:52,080
somehow dug up in the, uh, the
world of the esoteric as I do.

1357
01:10:52,350 --> 01:10:57,350
It could include favorite articles that
I've read and that I've shared with my

1358
01:10:58,050 --> 01:11:00,750
close friends, for instance.
And it's very short.

1359
01:11:00,810 --> 01:11:05,790

1377
01:12:14,740 --> 01:12:18,730
this episode is brought to
you by Wealthfront and this
is a very unique sponsor.

1378
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:23,500
Wealthfront is a massively disruptive
in a good way, set it and forget it.

1379
01:12:23,501 --> 01:12:27,850
Investing service led by technologists
from places like apple and world famous

1380
01:12:27,851 --> 01:12:28,630
investors.

1381
01:12:28,630 --> 01:12:32,320
It has exploded in popularity in the last
two years and they now have more than

1382
01:12:32,321 --> 01:12:35,290
two and a half a billion dollars
under management. In fact,

1383
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:36,670
some of my very good friends,

1384
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:39,880
investors in silicon valley have millions
of their own money in Wealthfront.

1385
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:42,970
So the question is why? Why is
it so popular? Why is it unique?

1386
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:47,260
Because you can get services previously
reserved for the ultra wealthy but only

1387
01:12:47,261 --> 01:12:49,210
pay pennies on the dollar for them.

1388
01:12:49,750 --> 01:12:52,960
And this is because they use smarter
software instead of retail locations,

1389
01:12:52,961 --> 01:12:55,720
bloated sales teams, et cetera. And
I'll come back to that in a second.

1390
01:12:56,230 --> 01:13:00,880
I suggest you check out wealthfront.com
forward slash Tim take the risk

1391
01:13:00,881 --> 01:13:04,120
assessment quiz which only takes two to
five minutes and they'll show you for

1392
01:13:04,121 --> 01:13:07,960
free exactly the portfolio they'd put
you at and if you just want to take their

1393
01:13:07,961 --> 01:13:11,860
advice, run with it, do it yourself.
You can do that or as I would,

1394
01:13:11,861 --> 01:13:13,720
you can set it and forget it.
Here's why.

1395
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:18,040
The value of Wealthfront is in the
automation of habits and strategies that

1396
01:13:18,041 --> 01:13:21,430
investors should be using on a
regular basis but normally aren't.

1397
01:13:21,850 --> 01:13:24,130
Great investing is a marathon,
not a sprint,

1398
01:13:24,190 --> 01:13:27,820
and little things that you may or may
not be familiar with like automatic tax

1399
01:13:27,821 --> 01:13:29,950
loss harvesting,
rebalancing your portfolio,

1400
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:34,450
cross more than 10 asset classes and
dividend reinvestment add up to very large

1401
01:13:34,451 --> 01:13:38,170
amounts of money over longer periods
of time. Wealth Front, as I mentioned,

1402
01:13:38,171 --> 01:13:40,780
since it's using software
instead of retail locations,

1403
01:13:40,790 --> 01:13:44,950
etc. Can offer all of this at low
costs that were previously completely

1404
01:13:44,951 --> 01:13:46,450
impossible right off the bat.

1405
01:13:46,630 --> 01:13:49,000
You never pay commissions or
account fees for everything.

1406
01:13:49,001 --> 01:13:54,001
They charge 0.25% per year on assets above
the first 15,000 which is managed for

1407
01:13:54,641 --> 01:13:58,330
free. If you use my link,
wealthfront.com forward slash Tim,

1408
01:13:58,630 --> 01:14:03,460
that is less than $5 a month to invest
a $30,000 account for instance. Now,

1409
01:14:03,461 --> 01:14:07,000
normally when I have a sponsor on this
show is because I use them and recommend

1410
01:14:07,001 --> 01:14:08,620
them. In this case,
it's a little different.

1411
01:14:08,980 --> 01:14:12,910
I don't use wealth front yet because
I'm not allowed to. Here's the deal.

1412
01:14:13,180 --> 01:14:17,170
They wanted to sponsor this podcast,
but because of sec regulations,

1413
01:14:17,410 --> 01:14:20,890
companies that invest your money are
not allowed to use client testimonials.

1414
01:14:20,891 --> 01:14:23,680
So I couldn't be a user end
have them on the podcast,

1415
01:14:24,190 --> 01:14:27,790
but I've been so impressed by Wealthfront
that I've invested a significant

1416
01:14:27,791 --> 01:14:31,660
amount of my own money, at least for me,
uh, in the team and the company itself.

1417
01:14:31,690 --> 01:14:34,720
So I am an investor and hope
to soon use it as a client.

1418
01:14:34,930 --> 01:14:38,320
Now back to the recommendation
as a Tim Ferriss show listener,

1419
01:14:38,350 --> 01:14:42,160
you'll get $15,000 managed for free
if you decide to open an account.

1420
01:14:42,550 --> 01:14:45,160
But just start with seeing the portfolio
that they would suggest for you.

1421
01:14:45,220 --> 01:14:49,330
Take two minutes, fill out their
questionnaire@wealthfront.com
forward slash. Tim,

1422
01:14:49,660 --> 01:14:53,980
it's fast, it's free. There's no downside
that I can think of. Just take a look,

1423
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:55,900
see what portfolio they
would create for you,

1424
01:14:55,990 --> 01:14:57,880
and you can use that
information however you want.

1425
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:01,930
wealthfront.com forward slash
Tim and until next time,

1426
01:15:02,380 --> 01:15:03,190
thank you for listening.
