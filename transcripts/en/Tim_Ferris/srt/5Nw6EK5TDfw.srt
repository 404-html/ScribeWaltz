1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,260
Hey guys,
Tim Ferriss here.

2
00:00:01,261 --> 00:00:06,261
I want to show you what I have in my
bag for Doug tricks and dog training.

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:11,490
This is a question that I've had a fair
amount and I do think there are some key

4
00:00:11,491 --> 00:00:15,600
elements. So first of all,
fashion is not a priority.

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,490
So you can see I have
the rock in Venice beach,

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,600
1980s fanny pack, rollerblader
style doesn't matter. Uh,

7
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:28,290
I have tried different versions
with carabiners and whatnot.

8
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:32,130
Some of them look like chalk bags. They
have a drawstring, all a huge hassle.

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,000
So I would not use those.
This is a dog gone.

10
00:00:36,001 --> 00:00:40,470
Good exclamation point, which I actually
find very good for a number of reasons.

11
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,390
There is a magnet,

12
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,730
so you can just do that and it
will close this to a draw string.

13
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,390
This becomes important when
food starts breaking apart.

14
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,550
So a couple of elements that
I want to point out here.

15
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:55,970
The first is that I have
primary pocket with dog treats.

16
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,200
All right, now I have a Ziploc bag
to prevent continual washing of this.

17
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,800
As far as the dog treats go,
you can use kibble.

18
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,810
You can use really cheap crap.

19
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,850
But as one of the trainers that I worked
with said to me, it's a crowded bar.

20
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,840
You got a tip of 20s. So if you're
giving them kibble, for instance,

21
00:01:15,841 --> 00:01:18,180
there was a period of two
or three weeks where Bali,

22
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:22,740
my pup wasn't responding to
anything, wasn't replying to
recall, meaning, you know,

23
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,710
come Molly wasn't doing anything
and it's giving you this kibble.

24
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:29,310
And it worked for a while and it didn't
compute that I needed to up the ante and

25
00:01:29,311 --> 00:01:31,290
go from ones to fives
to tends to twenties.

26
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:36,710
And that's when I started using
these lamb treats from origin, uh,

27
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,200
which are the equivalent
of 20s and immediately,

28
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:43,440
no difference in the
training within a week. Uh,

29
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:48,300
things took a complete hockey street,
a hockey stick trajectory. So, uh,

30
00:01:48,301 --> 00:01:51,330
that is part one.
Now on the inside pocket,

31
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,670
I do like that this has multiple pockets.

32
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,690
This was more useful and necessary when
she was a pup, but it had one of these,

33
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,970
and I use this for
getting her into the car.

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,260
I use this for getting her attention. And
this is a squeaker from a squeaker toy,

35
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:07,590
so it's usually inside some
type of plush animal, but

36
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,740
that is an irresistible sound to most
young dogs and gets their attention

37
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,850
immediately. So this was used very
early on. I don't use it as much,

38
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:22,140
if at all these days. All right. Few
other things that I want to point out.

39
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:25,590
There aren't that many. I keep this
on my right side. Almost always.

40
00:02:25,591 --> 00:02:29,280
Molly is very consistently on my left
side and there were some differences of

41
00:02:29,281 --> 00:02:32,220
opinion among trainers as to
which side you should have it on.

42
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,060
I don't think by and large
it matters all that much. Uh,

43
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,120
what I like to do is have this side
pocket immediately available for the

44
00:02:41,371 --> 00:02:41,791
clicker.

45
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:45,570
Now you'll notice that I've positioned
the clicker so that as soon as I pull it

46
00:02:45,571 --> 00:02:47,640
out,
sort of like positioning a handgun,

47
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:52,500
as soon as I have this and I pull
it out, it's ready to click. Okay.

48
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:56,310
That is a reward marker.
So if I say, Molly,

49
00:02:56,311 --> 00:03:00,700
come hand marker, she comes
poke, I can pick this out,

50
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:03,610
click and then give her a treat.
All right.

51
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,370
And there's obviously a lot more to it,

52
00:03:06,371 --> 00:03:08,500
but the clicker is a
constant companion for me.

53
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:11,950
I use it for precision if we're
working on new behaviors, new skills,

54
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:15,040
and the best books for that that I found,
I've read 20 or 30.

55
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,600
I'm sure there are other
good ones out there,

56
00:03:16,601 --> 00:03:21,601
but the most concise and I
think actionable are don't
shoot the dog by Karen

57
00:03:22,571 --> 00:03:27,250
prior with the extra chapter on clicker
training and a very hard to find book

58
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:31,180
called command performance, which is
a compilation by whole dog journal.

59
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,290
I'm sure it's in Berkeley or
Portland or somewhere and uh,

60
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,720
that is effectively one behavior every
two pages and it gives you a good

61
00:03:37,721 --> 00:03:41,200
overview of positive enforcement training,
opera and classical conditioning,

62
00:03:41,201 --> 00:03:45,940
etc. Okay,
next we have emergency pocket.

63
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,410
All right. So I have a very
weak whistle. Meaning if I'm,

64
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:55,120
it's not going to work for my dog is
200 feet away or 200 yards away. Right?

65
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:59,830
I've tried to learn how to whistle with
my fingers. It's comical. It's terrible.

66
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:04,250
It's completely tragic. So until
I'm able to do that, I have the,

67
00:04:04,251 --> 00:04:05,590
the emergency pocket.

68
00:04:05,591 --> 00:04:09,760
Now this is to get ahold of Molly if
she just goes Gonzo into red line and

69
00:04:09,761 --> 00:04:13,590
starts taking off.
There are two options and uh,

70
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:18,470
it depends really a, this is going
to be my first course of action. Um,

71
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:22,240
and this is a dog whistle.
All right?

72
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:26,740
So kind of like Mariah Carey record
sort of dog whistles. This is,

73
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:31,660
that's all that you hear. All right?
So it doesn't bother other humans.

74
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:35,230
She will hear this for sure.
Okay. So that's option number one.

75
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:38,170
And then if I really need
to pull the emergency brake,

76
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:43,060
this one is the regular old whistle.
Okay.

77
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:46,420
And I have a very particular whistle.

78
00:04:46,421 --> 00:04:49,450
I'm not going to give it out cause I
don't want other people imitating it,

79
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:54,430
but I do have a particular
whistle and cadence to recall it,

80
00:04:54,431 --> 00:04:58,030
Molly, right? So yours
could be like whatever.

81
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:02,870
It might be making it more
unique than just rover. But, uh,

82
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,210
everybody has the same whistle.

83
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:09,510
So pick up something that is your own
unique sort of code or Morse code for

84
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,000
recalling your dog. And, uh,

85
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:17,020
those are the items in my bag
that are most consistently used,

86
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,710
very versatile,
very easy to travel with.

87
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:25,330
I keep this fully stocked at all times
and just leave it by the door as is,

88
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:30,640
and I can grab the leash, grab this,
and off I go. If you enjoyed that video,

89
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,670
let's talk about a list. Arnold
Schwarzenegger, Jamie Foxx,

90
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:37,540
undisputed King of Big Wave Surfing.
Laird Hamilton. The list goes on and on.

91
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:40,420
What do they have in common?
They're sharing their secrets,

92
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:44,050
their morning routines, favorite books,
