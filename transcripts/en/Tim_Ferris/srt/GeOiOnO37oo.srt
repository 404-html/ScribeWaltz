00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,790
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02,791 --> 00:00:07,340
I can run flat out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking. Question,

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,080
I'm a cybernetic organism living.

I've used them for many years.

8
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,830
I used them to create book cover
prototypes for the four hour body,

9
00:00:37,831 --> 00:00:40,200
which went on to becoming number
one New York Times bestseller.

10
00:00:40,201 --> 00:00:44,460
I've also used them for
banner ads, illustrations, and
much more. With 99 designs.

This episode is brought to you by
gymnastic bodies.com this is the training

20
00:01:17,651 --> 00:01:21,580
system that I am most obsessed with
at the moment and I don't get paid any

21
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:22,990
commissions or anything like that.

22
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,890
You may have heard coach summer on
the podcast who designed the program,

23
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:30,070
former national team coach
for men's gymnastics.

24
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:34,660
I am not easily impressed and I've
just been completely blown away by the

25
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:38,020
sophistication of his programming
and the elegance of his programming.

26
00:01:38,021 --> 00:01:42,580
I've been using gymnastic bodies for
just a few months now and I feel more

27
00:01:42,581 --> 00:01:46,180
flexible, stronger, and
younger than I have in years.

28
00:01:46,181 --> 00:01:49,480
And it sounds cheesy to hear
myself say that, but it's true.

29
00:01:49,481 --> 00:01:52,420
That's the hardest part to
believe and you can check it out.

36
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,220
Hello boys and girls.
Ladies and germs.

37
00:02:19,221 --> 00:02:22,830
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another
episode of the Tim Ferriss show where

38
00:02:22,831 --> 00:02:26,960
it is usually my job to interview world
class performers and tease out the

39
00:02:26,961 --> 00:02:31,220
habits, routines, tools, tricks,
et cetera that you can use.

40
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,800
This episode is a role reversal.

41
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:38,830
I went to New York City and I sat down
with Stephen Dubner freakonomics fame and

42
00:02:39,261 --> 00:02:40,400
I was grilled.

43
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:44,150
I was hit with all sorts of questions
I had never heard before and we had a

44
00:02:44,151 --> 00:02:45,260
blast doing it.

45
00:02:45,261 --> 00:02:50,261
We had so much fun and their team did an
incredible job with post production and

46
00:02:50,751 --> 00:02:51,291
editing.

47
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:55,730
I wanted to share it with all of you and
you can of course find Steven and his

48
00:02:55,731 --> 00:03:00,731
team and his coauthor@freakonomics.com
at freakonomics on Twitter and

49
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:06,790
freakonomics radio in the podcasts
sphere and without further preamble,

50
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:11,791
please enjoy my wide ranging sometimes
very odd conversation with Stephen

51
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,073
Dubner.

52
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:19,000
If you don't try hard,
no matter how much talent you have,

53
00:03:19,001 --> 00:03:22,270
there's always going to be someone else
who has a similar amount of talent who

54
00:03:22,271 --> 00:03:26,110
out works you and therefore
outperforms you. It's very easy.

55
00:03:26,111 --> 00:03:30,790
I think in a digital age easier than
ever to confuse being busy with being

56
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:32,650
productive and they're just
not the same thing. Well,

57
00:03:32,651 --> 00:03:34,930
what if I did something
with some more passion?

58
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:37,210
What if I found something to
be a deeper interest to me?

59
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:42,040
I thought maybe I should give it a go
and see if it was actually possible to

60
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:42,874
improve.

61
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:48,370
Let's start with in 60 seconds or less
what you actually do in a given day if

62
00:03:48,371 --> 00:03:49,780
you have such a thing as a given day.

63
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,520
I would say interviewing experts,

64
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:59,090
tracking down eccentric Weirdos who are
really good at one thing or another.

65
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:04,750
Formulating a plan for some
type of experiment involving
their observations are

66
00:04:05,031 --> 00:04:09,830
findings and then recording it.
That is what I do most days.

67
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,930
That is Tim Ferriss.
He is,

68
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,920
hmm.
What is he exactly?

69
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:18,530
I am a human Guinea pig and
professional dilettante.

70
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,600
For our final self improvement episode,

71
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:28,220
a man whose entire life and career are
one big pile of self improvement of

72
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:32,950
accelerated self improvement as
evidenced by his book titles.

73
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:37,150
The four hour work week,
the four hour chef,

74
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,070
the four hour body,

75
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:44,080
Tim Ferris is in fact such a poster boy
for self improvement that you might be

76
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:46,540
as I first was a bit suspicious,

77
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,040
I'd seen your face and I knew that you
were the four hour blank guy and of

78
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,980
course I assumed that you were a
total charlatan. Of course. Right?

79
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:59,040
Cause that's how could you not with a
title like that Tim Ferris Charlatan or

80
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,520
self improvement wizard,

81
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:04,990
you'll be the judge as we cover
everything from his humble beginnings,

82
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,740
I mean very much the runt of the litter
in school and some rough patches.

83
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:13,830
So I've had extended periods of depression
that I've become better at mitigating

84
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:18,730
over time to his good
fortune in startup investing.

85
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:23,140
Facebook also did very well to the
reason that millions of people do every

86
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:25,630
single thing the Tim
Ferriss tells him to do.

87
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:31,350
So the objective is to provide you with
tools and principles for 10 x in your

88
00:05:31,961 --> 00:05:32,794
hourly output.

89
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:38,260
Is there anyone here who isn't interested
in 10 exing their hourly output?

90
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,870
No,
I didn't think so.

91
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:55,380
From wny c studios,
this is freakonomics radio.

92
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,340
The podcast that explores the
hidden side of everything.

93
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,980
Here's your host,
Steven Dubner.

94
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,500
Tim Ferris

95
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:11,030
recently stopped by our studio with a
head full of ideas and as you'll hear,

96
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,280
a belly full of sardines.

97
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:18,640
I suppose my professional life can be
split into writing books that all sound

98
00:06:18,641 --> 00:06:20,230
like infomercial products,

99
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:24,070
most notably the four hour
workweek and then tech investing.

100
00:06:24,071 --> 00:06:29,071
So if you had to pick a noun or maybe two
to describe what you think of yourself

101
00:06:29,561 --> 00:06:32,710
as, what is the noun?
Noun will be teacher.

102
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,410
I don't view myself as a
writer first and foremost.

103
00:06:35,411 --> 00:06:39,580
I always thought I was
gonna end up teaching ninth
grade specifically because I

104
00:06:39,581 --> 00:06:42,790
had a lot of really formative influences.

105
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:46,900
I think at that fork in the road or a lot
of crucial decisions are made by young

106
00:06:46,901 --> 00:06:51,880
folks, but I view my job as testing
many, many different things,

107
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:55,990
performing experiments and then
providing the cliff notes to people.

108
00:06:55,991 --> 00:06:56,824
As a teacher.

109
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:01,330
Not long ago you also started a podcast
which is called the Tim Ferriss show.

110
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,980
Now why did you want to go
and do a thing like that?

111
00:07:02,981 --> 00:07:04,930
Cause we all know that
podcasting is not where it's at.

112
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:10,680
It was intended to be a break between
large book projects and I have this nasty

113
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:12,240
habit of writing along books.

114
00:07:12,241 --> 00:07:15,690
So the four hour chef was 670 pages.

115
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:20,490
So weird in the best way. They're
not narrative from beginning to end.

116
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:24,870
Even when they kind of feel a little bit
like those self help books with boxes

117
00:07:24,871 --> 00:07:29,870
and charts, you are just zany in a way
that reminds me, I'll be honest with you,

118
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:32,550
of one person where anyone else,
which was my mom,

119
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,820
my mom was this kind of Brooklyn girl who
ended up in upstate New York trying to

120
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,850
be a pioneer woman and raise
eight kids and she did it.

121
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,630
She had to figure out all this stuff and
that's what strikes me is what you have

122
00:07:42,631 --> 00:07:47,631
this intense either curiosity or need or
something to figure out stuff and then

123
00:07:50,311 --> 00:07:52,770
tell other people about it, which
is, you know, generous of you.

124
00:07:52,771 --> 00:07:55,290
Where does that come from?
Why?

125
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:58,650
Why are you not satisfied with
just being like everybody else?

126
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,220
I think the answer's
twofold. So, number one,

127
00:08:02,221 --> 00:08:06,040
my mom always encouraged me to
march to my own drummer. So that

128
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,570
how,
how'd you do that?

129
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,460
She exposed. Me and my brother. I have
one sibling, a younger brother, too many,

130
00:08:13,461 --> 00:08:16,010
many different environments. My parents
didn't have much money growing up,

131
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,570
but they always had a budget for books.

132
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:21,290
And my mom would take us to
experience things firsthand,

133
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:26,291
like go to the beach and take leftover
chicken bones and tie them to strings and

134
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:30,350
fish for crabs, which we threw back.
But the, the list just went on and on.

135
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:34,580
And if we grasped on anything and became
really passionate, then she would, uh,

136
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:35,660
and,
and my father as well.
