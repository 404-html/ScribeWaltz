1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,960
All that stuff that I'm sure that'll
equal if not surpass whenever you got it.

2
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:16,350
Okay. It looks like
it's recording. Okay. So

3
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:24,530
that's fine.
You got to do

4
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,860
what's great about it is
the most important position.

5
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,310
So we get great feedback from it.
So,

6
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:44,600
so we're skipping through the,
you know,

7
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:49,620
a lot more like work on with major
league guys is the timing of his swing.

8
00:00:50,401 --> 00:00:53,460
That's an important thing for them
because really the main thing for it,

9
00:00:53,461 --> 00:00:58,200
for a picture it is, is to throw off
their time. But at the same time,

10
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,200
once they do swing, guys have, you know,

11
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,570
guys are missing out on a tremendous
amount of opportunity even through the

12
00:01:06,571 --> 00:01:10,710
swing. So basically my job is
to park. I look at, you know,

13
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,440
there's the stride,
which is basically a whole nother level.

14
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:18,980
So with you, we're just going to
work mainly on the ones you swing.

15
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,280
So what I'd like to see you do is I want
you to first feel most of your weight

16
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,810
on your heels.
And when I say that,

17
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,130
I would say about 60 40 and the reason
why I said it's because there is no,

18
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,940
no need for our cats and baseball.

19
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:43,550
So the only thing that calves will do
is get your center of gravity or ask one

20
00:01:44,921 --> 00:01:49,140
of the fuel that right. Whether
it be through your, okay.

21
00:01:49,141 --> 00:01:52,770
Cause we're going to use that
for the week. When we straighten,

22
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,900
we're going to straighten
it and push that up. Okay.

23
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:59,400
So I'd like you to feel
that's the one thing,

24
00:01:59,401 --> 00:02:02,720
and I'm not going to put too much in
your head, but that's the one thing.

25
00:02:02,721 --> 00:02:06,720
We'll take some swings,
feeling the weight in that proper place.

26
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,880
And the only other thing I want you
to feel for now, and you do this well,

27
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,270
you get an a slop,
but get into the slot Lao,

28
00:02:15,271 --> 00:02:18,810
your arms and drop and your
spine angle from this angle,

29
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,890
keeping it straight so they're
actually cannot throw three things.

30
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,920
And you can think about just one
would be just one quick question.

31
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,250
What's the weight distribution

32
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,060
by back?

33
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,553
Yeah.

34
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:43,710
You are 50 50 or a little
bit more on your back leg.

35
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,430
Okay. Whatever's really,
whatever's comfortable,

36
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,190
but you're going to take a step over.
You aren't going to ship.

37
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,920
So it's more, what I've been
trying to do is line up like that,

38
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,590
less of that stuff actually

39
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:14,980
start like this. So the
star rating is not, okay.

40
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:19,150
So let's just go with the stripe
and that's right there. Perfect.

41
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:24,420
So what I'd like to see you do is keep
your bags exactly right there and close

42
00:03:24,701 --> 00:03:29,350
the Shul. Okay? Okay. Now,

43
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:32,620
once Tim starts to open up the swing,

44
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:35,650
that's when this arm drops.
So from here,

45
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,650
just like you could think about a pitcher,
pitcher goes like this,

46
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:42,820
boom is here.
Now the needle himself.

47
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:50,320
So say the same thing. They
basically been noon, I'll read it.

48
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,930
So basically your same swing
because you're swinging.

49
00:03:55,931 --> 00:03:57,310
I mean really it was,

50
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:02,460
there's not much to mess with as far
as anything. But what I'm saying.

51
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,750
Okay,
so,

52
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:09,280
so you're just gonna stand here or what
I want you to do is the weight is the

53
00:04:09,281 --> 00:04:12,130
weight distribution as it is
on your heels and your foot.

54
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,790
I want you to feel as you step
towards the bag and just like I said,

55
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:19,870
doing natural step,

56
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:23,830
you don't have to think about it
because you do a very big step. Okay?

57
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:27,690
So you do a natural step.
The only thing on what you think about is,

58
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,020
yeah,
I want you to,

59
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:36,130
as the foot lands feel coiled and we're
not going to do any pausing with the leg

60
00:04:36,131 --> 00:04:40,650
or anything like that. I just want
you to do a coiled all right here.

61
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:45,540
We you're going to explode into get a

62
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:52,240
down for, um, it's,

63
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:57,270
it's a preference thing choking up
would be about here and no choke up.

64
00:04:58,961 --> 00:04:59,890
And being about here,

65
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:05,260
I used to when I played like just
to hold it with a little joke. Okay.

66
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:11,410
But there are guys it like,
and I'm not really sure why,

67
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:16,060
but um, if you want to, let's
talk about Greg, just recite

68
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,750
to me,
you know,

69
00:05:19,751 --> 00:05:23,830
this is the one contact you
have with your weapon and um,

70
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,530
the mass is being transformed.
We call about that.

71
00:05:26,531 --> 00:05:30,220
So you want to have what
I call a consistent grip.

72
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:34,120
And that's not just from the beginning.
That's not just at the end,

73
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:37,630
but that's through the swing shift.
And I say that because

74
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:39,520
hitters,

75
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,990
lucid hitters just lose consciousness
through the swing that are focused on the

76
00:05:43,991 --> 00:05:47,970
ball. Unfortunately, they don't
do the training that I do.

77
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:53,110
So there were, their hands
will come off, you know,

78
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,020
especially if they do
the hands personally.

79
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:57,740
Hands just simply cannot be the on back.

80
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:02,270
That was too vast logo or so what I tell
kids and sometimes that's completely

81
00:06:02,271 --> 00:06:06,440
changed their swing is keep the hand
every part of the is on the bed,

82
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:11,380
keep it on throughout the whole swing.
And that's a seminar that would,

83
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:16,340
that grabs the entire hand.
So then you know,

84
00:06:16,341 --> 00:06:20,730
it forces you kind of hear
so,

85
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:21,843
so go ahead.

86
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:26,330
And I would say just don't worry about

87
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:31,440
that. Right. Okay.

88
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,273
Okay.

89
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:51,430
So the one that you're
focused on is actually for
now just get used to it in the

90
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:56,450
back. Don't even think
about that. Good. Yeah.

91
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,183
Good.

92
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:32,960
Okay.
Yeah.

93
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:43,370
So
the reason why it's going the small over,

94
00:07:43,371 --> 00:07:48,200
I was going to be a little
more speed. Okay. Okay. So, uh,

95
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,650
so,
uh,

96
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:54,960
I want you to feel as your foot lands,

97
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,590
and this is just going to be a momentary
feeling. Feel the shoulders developable.

98
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,553
Yep.

99
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:05,300
So you're one is going to land
facing down the first baseline. Yep.

100
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:07,681
Well,

101
00:08:07,681 --> 00:08:12,270
your shoulders are going to be portable
and then as you slow from the ground up,

102
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:13,390
you're going to unwind that.

103
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,303
Okay.

104
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:45,503
Good.

105
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:25,190
And her shoulders.

106
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,280
So it's going to be, it's going to look
like that. It's really just thinking about

107
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,460
your fully wound up

108
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:52,230
only as your shoulders start to open

109
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:06,550
new field. So it's like this. Boom.

110
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:22,050
Okay. So yeah, that's the only thing.

111
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,063
What

112
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:30,870
I'll do is help in baby steps here to say,
okay,

113
00:10:30,871 --> 00:10:34,740
let's just do this in a second
shoulder. Let's just do that. Yeah.

114
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,480
Don't worry about
anything else. Fall. Work

115
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,270
a little bit

116
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:57,620
about what you just did
right there. Perfect. Okay,

117
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:00,590
good.
Do it three more times.

118
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,220
You jumped the gun and

119
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:17,660
okay. There was one more
time and stay there. Okay.

120
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:21,920
So I'm just going to go boom.
That's it. That's enough.
