1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,690
Hey folks, we're going to talk
about meditation for a second.

2
00:00:03,691 --> 00:00:05,970
I get a lot of questions
about how to start meditating.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,870
Keeping in mind that I had a,

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:13,140
a very severe allergy to the word and
concept of meditation for a very long

5
00:00:13,141 --> 00:00:14,580
time,
more than a decade,

6
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:19,140
and I've only really consistently
started meditating and,

7
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,080
uh, implemented meditating for
the last two to three years.

8
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:25,650
There are few easy ways to get started,
but before I talk about that,

9
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,830
what is meditation?
There are a few ways you can look at it.

10
00:00:28,831 --> 00:00:33,780
I think the simplest way to look at it
as a type a personality is either as a

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,200
warm bath for your mind so
that you relax in such a way.

12
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,800
Maybe it's only 10% to reduce your
anxiety so you can be more effective and

13
00:00:43,801 --> 00:00:46,530
productive, less reactive, in other words,

14
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:51,810
don't get carried away by knee
jerk emotions and judgments,

15
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:53,370
obsessing on the past,

16
00:00:53,371 --> 00:00:56,130
something that happened or something
in the future planning, etc.

17
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,450
You're able to actually single task
and focus. That is one of the outcomes,

18
00:01:00,451 --> 00:01:03,570
one of the benefits of different
types of meditating. All right.

19
00:01:03,571 --> 00:01:06,540
And that can take the form of something
very short or something a little more

20
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:09,270
involved.
I'll talk about both the other,

21
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:14,300
and this is why I think meditation
can be viewed in a way as

22
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:22,710
stoic training or a in
some ways similar to CBT,

23
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,740
cognitive behavioral therapy because
the objective is to help you to observe

24
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:33,570
your state and your thoughts so that
you are less controlled by them.

25
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,040
What does this mean? I'll
use an analogy that, uh,

26
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,730
I think was originally shared
with me by Andy Puddicombe, uh,

27
00:01:41,731 --> 00:01:43,590
who is the founder of
something called headspace,

28
00:01:43,591 --> 00:01:48,570
which I'll talk about in a second,
which is the difference in effect being,

29
00:01:48,571 --> 00:01:51,450
say,
standing out in the storm,

30
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:55,530
getting pelted with rain and hail and
wind and staying in your eyes and so on,

31
00:01:55,531 --> 00:01:58,650
being soaking wet or standing inside,

32
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,540
looking through the glass at the storm.

33
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:05,040
The ladder is meditation the way I've put
it before, which is slightly different.

34
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:09,060
It's the difference between being in
the washing machine or standing outside

35
00:02:09,061 --> 00:02:10,500
looking into the washing machine.

36
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,040
And when you have that somewhat
detached observer perspective,

37
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:18,660
you can just be much calmer,
much more appreciative,

38
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,070
and ultimately effective.

39
00:02:20,071 --> 00:02:24,000
I do not think that meditation
causes you to lose your edge.

40
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:27,810
This was a concern of mine and I think
it's a concern of a lot of type a driven

41
00:02:27,811 --> 00:02:28,644
people.

42
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:34,700
But even if it did cause you to lose
saying 10% who cares ultimately are trying

43
00:02:36,181 --> 00:02:38,190
to succeed and make more
money and do all these things,

44
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:42,540
build a bigger business to improve the
quality of life for yourself, for others.

45
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:45,070
And you achieve that I
think more directly, uh,

46
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:48,840
in many cases by even if you had to take,
say,

47
00:02:48,841 --> 00:02:53,430
a 10% haircut on your edge by improving
your present state awareness by,

48
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,610
uh, much, much more, 50
to a hundred percent.

49
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,400
So let's jump into a couple of
options, right? So if you're not a dog,

50
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,710
because dogs are always present,
state aware,

51
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,120
then you need some human tools.
One option,

52
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:08,980
and this is the way I
started very early on,

53
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:11,770
meditating was listening to one song.

54
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:16,240
So find one song that puts you into a
good mood and in the morning all you're

55
00:03:16,241 --> 00:03:19,810
going to do is sit comfortably.

56
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:24,100
So this could be sitting in a chair,
feet on the floor,

57
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:27,040
just like this.
Hands in your lap,

58
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,930
you generally you're going to want
some type of backs and forth. Uh,

59
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,600
you do not need a dog
chewing on a squeaky toy.

60
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:38,410
So I may intervene molecule here,

61
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:41,830
camp or you can sit like this,

62
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:46,930
which is how I tend to sit when I
meditate. So this is not full lotus,

63
00:03:46,931 --> 00:03:49,100
this is half lotus,
not even half load.

64
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:53,610
It's really just one foot tucked
into the crease of my calf and thigh.

65
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:57,340
And then I'm going to kind
of pull the butt cheeks.

66
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,800
So then I have a nice little seat here,

67
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:04,810
back flat and then my hands are either
going to be in my lap like so or I will

68
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:07,630
actually post my hands
on my thighs like this,

69
00:04:07,631 --> 00:04:10,780
which can also help if you have a
tendency of slouching to keep your back

70
00:04:10,781 --> 00:04:15,010
straight. All right, listen
to one song. For me it was a,

71
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:17,440
we're going to party
like it's 1999 prince.

72
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:20,140
It's hard to be as stressed
out worrying about things.

73
00:04:20,141 --> 00:04:24,670
If you listen to that song, trust me,
you can pick whatever poison you like,

74
00:04:24,671 --> 00:04:29,671
but this was shared with me by Kemal
Robert Kahn and he suggested listening to

75
00:04:30,341 --> 00:04:35,200
one song doing nothing in particular
other than listening to the song and

76
00:04:35,201 --> 00:04:38,020
breathing, and that's three
to four minutes. That's it.

77
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,640
So you could try that in the morning.

78
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:43,360
That was one of the first approaches
I took. The second approach,

79
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,350
which I think is very,

80
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:49,351
very effective and best for many people
is some form of guided meditation.

81
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:55,890
This means that instead of sitting by
yourself and being completely dependent on

82
00:04:56,501 --> 00:05:00,160
whatever's happening in your mind and
developing that skill of observation,

83
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:01,750
you're listening to something.

84
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:05,740
And that could be any number
of different types of audio.

85
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:06,910
So one would be,

86
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,740
and there are many different types and
recorded guided meditations by people

87
00:05:11,741 --> 00:05:13,000
like Sam Harris.

88
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:18,030
So same harris.org he is a neuroscience
phd or Tara Brock said Tara Brock,

89
00:05:19,391 --> 00:05:19,851
B R,
a,

90
00:05:19,851 --> 00:05:24,851
c h who I've had on the podcast and fair
shell has a fantastic audio called the

91
00:05:25,691 --> 00:05:29,020
2010 summer smile meditation.

92
00:05:29,021 --> 00:05:32,740
You can find it for free and some
incredible folks like Maria Popova for

93
00:05:32,741 --> 00:05:33,970
instance,
who runs brain pickings,

94
00:05:33,971 --> 00:05:38,230
listened to that every morning and credit
it with a really changing their lives.

95
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:41,860
So those are two you can find immediately
just searching right after this video.

96
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,600
You can also use guided meditation
that is more progressive.

97
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,860
It's almost like weight training.

98
00:05:47,861 --> 00:05:52,450
There's progressive resistance
or progressive difficulty
and there are many good

99
00:05:52,451 --> 00:05:57,380
options out there. So I've used say
headspace for weeks and weeks at time.

100
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,260
Uh, it is a very easy way to
meditate. Also, if you're,

101
00:06:00,261 --> 00:06:04,490
say sitting in a plane or sitting in a
car and you can drop in your ear phones

102
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:08,240
and you're good to go,
another would be calm.

103
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,270
There are a number of different
varieties and options here.

104
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,720
Let's say that you've listened this
far in. You're like, God, I just,

105
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,880
I'm not some hippy woo person.

106
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:20,300
I just want to perform better.

107
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,420
Really don't care about this thing
that you're calling meditation. Okay,

108
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:26,420
well I have an option for you
because even in my own mind,

109
00:06:26,421 --> 00:06:30,530
I wonder when I see the
benefits of meditation, which
are generally better sleep,

110
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,760
less dependence on caffeine,

111
00:06:31,761 --> 00:06:35,240
you become much more sensitive to
things like caffeine and alcohol. Uh,

112
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,350
better ability to execute and
focus on the important things.

113
00:06:38,351 --> 00:06:41,960
So maybe I'm not doing a hundred things.
I'm doing 20,

114
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:46,430
but the 20 or better thought through
and more important, in fact, uh,

115
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:48,830
I wonder though,

116
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:52,820
is the benefit coming from simply sitting
with really good posture for 10 to 20

117
00:06:52,821 --> 00:06:54,770
minutes?
Is it coming from the breathing?

118
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:57,140
Is it coming from closing my
eyes and doing the breathing?

119
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,440
Is it coming from the exercise that
I'm doing inside my own head river that

120
00:07:00,441 --> 00:07:04,730
might be, or something else? I happen to
think a lot of it is from the breathing.

121
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:10,040
All right?
Now if you then want to skip meditation,

122
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:13,220
you could download an APP
called apnea trainer, uh,

123
00:07:13,221 --> 00:07:17,570
which has pranayama breathing and
it is designed for free divers.

124
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,470
I do not recommend doing any of these
breathing exercises before getting in

125
00:07:21,471 --> 00:07:25,520
water. You can cause yourself a lot of
trouble unless you have highly qualified

126
00:07:25,521 --> 00:07:29,540
professional instruction.
Okay. But the apnea trainer,

127
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:33,320
which was introduced to me by Gabby Reese,
who's married to Laird Hamilton,

128
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:37,850
so Gabby, incredible world class athlete
in her own right. And then layered,

129
00:07:37,851 --> 00:07:39,020
who is the,

130
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:42,260
I think most people would
say the undisputed King of
Big Wave Surfing at least

131
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:43,100
was for decades,

132
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:46,640
introduced me to this and it will have
you do different types of breathing

133
00:07:46,641 --> 00:07:50,000
patterns and we'll count you down.
So it might say five seconds.

134
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:54,710
Inhale five second,
hold ten second, exhale,

135
00:07:54,711 --> 00:07:55,460
five second holds.

136
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:59,870
That would be one type that you could
use plenty amo or you could do something

137
00:07:59,871 --> 00:08:04,340
like five seconds. Inhale
22nd, hold ten second exhale.

138
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,540
And then back to repeat that cycle
and just listening to the counting and

139
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:13,220
breathing along with it. I find to
be extremely calming and centering.

140
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,170
Uh, I almost do all of my meditation
earlier in the day, in the morning.

141
00:08:18,171 --> 00:08:21,950
I try to do it before
turning on the phone.

142
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:25,010
So if you look at my phone right now,
well first it was a coyote on it,

143
00:08:25,011 --> 00:08:26,330
but that's a longer story.

144
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:30,650
There is an airplane icon up here in the
corner because I almost always have my

145
00:08:30,651 --> 00:08:32,420
phone on airplane mode when I go to bed.

146
00:08:32,421 --> 00:08:36,410
It's an airplane mode and I try not to
turn it on because you then you get the

147
00:08:36,411 --> 00:08:40,610
barrage of bullets, IEE, text messages,

148
00:08:40,611 --> 00:08:44,630
and different notifications, which
immediately puts you into a reactive mode.

149
00:08:44,631 --> 00:08:48,770
So before that, I like to
meditate, feed my pooch, et cetera.

150
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,120
And then, and only then, maybe after some
journaling, turn on the phone. All right,

151
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,440
other options for meditation
if you really want to into it.

152
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,110
What caused it to finally stick for me?

153
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,030
And now I can play around with
all these different options.

154
00:09:00,031 --> 00:09:05,031
But what really got me to
meditate consistently was
taking a class and I took a

155
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:09,330
transmittal meditation class.
That's tm.org.

156
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,230
These are not cheap. I think there's
somewhere between a thousand and $2,000,

157
00:09:13,231 --> 00:09:16,950
which is in my mind, kind of silly. Uh,

158
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,200
but Rick Rubin,

159
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:22,920
legendary music producer had asked
me if I'd ever tried TM at one point.

160
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:26,520
And then, uh, I took his advice, but I, I,

161
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:30,300
I looked into it and I decided that I
don't want to have to pay 1000 bucks for

162
00:09:30,301 --> 00:09:32,520
someone to give me a month from
what the hell's a mantra? Anyway,

163
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,120
it's very skeptical, but continued
to be very, very stressed out.

164
00:09:36,121 --> 00:09:37,140
And then Chase Jarvis,

165
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:41,130
it was a very well known photographer
and CEO of critical and creative,

166
00:09:41,131 --> 00:09:44,370
live creative, live.com.
Check it out. It's fantastic.

167
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,720
I said, what do you have
to lose? You can afford it.

168
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:52,560
So even if it ends up being a complete
waste of money now he was the second

169
00:09:52,561 --> 00:09:57,420
person saying, I do TM twice
a day. Why not just do it?

170
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:01,080
You can afford to lose it even if
it's a total waste of time. So I did.

171
00:10:01,081 --> 00:10:01,861
And Lo and behold,

172
00:10:01,861 --> 00:10:06,660
having someone to be accountable
to who was teaching me every day,

173
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:11,710
generally during lunch hour and in between
sessions was giving me the homework

174
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:15,870
assignment of to meditation sessions,
which I then had to report back on it,

175
00:10:15,871 --> 00:10:17,790
discuss with sed teacher.

176
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:22,970
It was enough social pressure to get me
to finally do it twice a day for four or

177
00:10:23,371 --> 00:10:27,120
five days, and at that point
that started an unbroken streak.

178
00:10:27,121 --> 00:10:31,260
I want to say I have about a year and a
half of meditating at least once a day,

179
00:10:31,261 --> 00:10:34,050
often twice a day. So that
was really, I would say,

180
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:37,650
one of the tipping points for me,
if you want to get the gist of TM,

181
00:10:37,651 --> 00:10:40,650
and there's some weird aspects of the
organization that I'm not a huge fan of,

182
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:43,350
but it's,
it's surprisingly secular.

183
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,560
Once you get past the first
meeting and the first meeting,

184
00:10:46,561 --> 00:10:49,800
you have to bring fruit and flowers and
they make an offering to the founder and

185
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:53,970
it's a little culty. But once you
get past that, then it's like, okay,

186
00:10:53,971 --> 00:10:54,691
what do you do?

187
00:10:54,691 --> 00:10:58,140
If you're in a hotel and room service
comes in and you're halfway through

188
00:10:58,141 --> 00:11:00,660
meditation, what do you do? Do
you stop? Do you talk to them?

189
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:04,170
Do you just ignore them? What are the
coping mechanisms? So it's very tactical,

190
00:11:04,171 --> 00:11:06,810
practical in my experience.
Uh,

191
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:11,840
but they insist that you need someone
sort of as life support indefinitely to

192
00:11:11,911 --> 00:11:15,830
teach UTM. The basics
are, you get a mantra, uh,

193
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,960
I think they're probably
all two syllables.

194
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:23,130
And if you want it to get a flavor for
what that type of meditation is like,

195
00:11:23,131 --> 00:11:26,580
although I do think there's incredible
value in having a teacher who holds you

196
00:11:26,581 --> 00:11:29,340
accountable, you could take, and
they would disagree with this,

197
00:11:29,341 --> 00:11:34,341
but you could take some two syllable
word could be nonsense or not.

198
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,980
You could use nature, right?
Nature, nature, nature,

199
00:11:37,981 --> 00:11:42,450
and say that over and over and literally
you're effectively just repeating that

200
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:47,010
ad nauseum for the period of time in
which you're doing the meditation for

201
00:11:47,011 --> 00:11:49,860
trends and the meditation.
And the generally recommend 20 minutes,

202
00:11:49,861 --> 00:11:52,410
first thing in the morning,
and then 20 minutes, let's say,

203
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:55,480
is chase does it right
before dinner. All right? Uh,

204
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,150
I almost always just do
the morning meditation.

205
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:02,110
Back in the day I was more diligent
about doing it twice a day.

206
00:12:02,111 --> 00:12:05,830
I do think there's a lot of value there,
but if you just get it in the morning,

207
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:10,840
there is a lot of value to be had.
And beyond that,

208
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,020
I would say if you wanted
to start super small,

209
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:20,010
you could just do an experiment and
the experiment is not 20 minutes in the

210
00:12:20,261 --> 00:12:22,750
morning, not 30 minutes, twice a day.

211
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:26,830
It's not a long guided meditation,
nothing like that. And by the way,

212
00:12:26,831 --> 00:12:31,780
the apps I mentioned are generally
a modifiable in terms of duration.

213
00:12:31,781 --> 00:12:34,720
So you do 10 minutes, 15. I did, I did 10,

214
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:37,210
four weeks at a time when I was
on book deadline for instance.

215
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:41,590
But let's make it even shorter. What you
could try. They're two different types.

216
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:45,880
So one is something that I started doing
for myself whenever I would get anxious

217
00:12:45,881 --> 00:12:48,850
or I felt myself may
be getting angry or uh,

218
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,830
a ground swell of emotion that I
felt was unpleasant or unproductive,

219
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:56,230
I would take what I call
the three breaths break.

220
00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:00,310
So three rough break is exactly what it
sounds like. You stop what you're doing.

221
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,440
That's one.

222
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,440
Just do that three times and it's
amazing how well that diffuses what could

223
00:13:11,381 --> 00:13:15,520
otherwise become really
stupid or rash decisions, uh,

224
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,560
and pretty easy.

225
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:21,700
So try to remember to do a three breath
break and you could do that for a day or

226
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:23,560
two.
And very important,

227
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:27,400
set that intention in the morning set
that is a clear objective for the day.

228
00:13:27,401 --> 00:13:30,100
And then at night review
how often you used it,

229
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:31,690
when you could have
used it when you didn't.

230
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,240
This type of pre and post
game is very important.

231
00:13:34,241 --> 00:13:36,760
If you're going to do an experiment
with something very small like that.

232
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:41,740
And then I would say
the next you could test,

233
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:46,440
and this was in my latest book, tools of
titans, but the basic gist, this is a,

234
00:13:46,441 --> 00:13:48,310
I believe his loving kindness meditation.

235
00:13:48,311 --> 00:13:51,100
But forget about the label
because it sounds too woo
woo and it's weird sounding,

236
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:54,940
but, uh, Meng, so chade Meng ton,

237
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:58,330
who was previously at Google's,
one of the very early engineers,

238
00:13:58,331 --> 00:14:01,960
he developed a course at Google
available to employees called,

239
00:14:01,961 --> 00:14:03,400
I think it was search inside yourself.

240
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:06,880
And it quickly became the most
popular course within Google.

241
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:09,610
Thousands of employees.
There's a waitlist for I think six months.

242
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:15,030
And I taught many different tools laid
to mindfulness and meditation and one of

243
00:14:16,211 --> 00:14:17,460
them which end,

244
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:21,700
he tells a story that is in tools of
titans about a woman who tried it.

245
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:26,080
I'd never done meditation before and she
said, I had my best day in seven years.

246
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,750
Okay,
well what provoked that?

247
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:32,860
It's a very simple approach and I've
heard said a number of people have said

248
00:14:32,861 --> 00:14:34,050
before that,
uh,

249
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,860
I think Andy I mentioned before has also
said 10 minutes of meditating on other

250
00:14:38,861 --> 00:14:43,210
people or the wider world is
worth 10 hours of meditating
on yourself. All right,

251
00:14:43,211 --> 00:14:44,440
so let's assume that's true.

252
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:48,940
One very easy way to test
that out is when you're doing,

253
00:14:48,941 --> 00:14:52,310
say you're three breath break
or you just take a few minutes,

254
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:57,080
five minutes to sit down and
in the morning for instance,

255
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:59,000
or whenever you're feeling stressed out,

256
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:04,150
think about a few people you're grateful
for and then wish them to be happy.

257
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:08,550
That's it. So you just imagine three
people you're really grateful for.

258
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,700
They could be new relationships,
old relationships,

259
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,770
maybe childhood friends who
haven't seen in a really long time,

260
00:15:12,771 --> 00:15:14,000
teachers for long ago.

261
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:19,420
Think about them and then you're just
going to wish them happiness and hope that

262
00:15:19,641 --> 00:15:23,660
they are happy and hold that
in your mind for a few minutes.

263
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:26,880
It sounds so silly and so simple.
Uh,

264
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:30,950
yet that is what this woman did
where she was in her office.

265
00:15:30,951 --> 00:15:35,330
And I think every hour she thought of
a coworker and wish them happiness.

266
00:15:35,331 --> 00:15:38,450
And she did that for a few hours and I
had the best day in the office I've had

267
00:15:38,451 --> 00:15:43,050
in seven years. So you can try that also.
Very, very simple. So if you're like, ah,

268
00:15:43,051 --> 00:15:47,030
I don't want to think about my breath or
my, this, my, that, track my thoughts,

269
00:15:47,031 --> 00:15:48,710
I'm too scattered rent,
blah, blah. Okay, fine.

270
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:53,990
Just think about a handful of
other people, two or three and uh,

271
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,630
wish them happiness.
It's so simple.

272
00:15:56,631 --> 00:15:59,780
I did this when I was finishing tools of
titans or I was about two thirds of the

273
00:15:59,781 --> 00:16:04,250
way through and I was overseas and I did
a sauna every night because a bunch of

274
00:16:04,251 --> 00:16:05,600
my guests do is every night.

275
00:16:05,601 --> 00:16:08,780
So I started doing it and I would sit
there and it's sometimes we doing editing

276
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,720
by hand. I get too sweaty, get to
a point where I couldn't do that.

277
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:13,970
And I would sit there and I'll do
this loving kindness meditation.

278
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:19,330
And I remember getting to the end of the
week and thinking to myself and asking,

279
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,440
why am I so happy?
I mean,

280
00:16:21,441 --> 00:16:24,080
you kind of know you need to fix
things if you asked yourself that.

281
00:16:24,081 --> 00:16:26,150
But I tend to be pretty tightly wound,

282
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:31,460
a very aggressive and I focused a lot
more on achievement than say contentment

283
00:16:31,461 --> 00:16:34,210
or happiness in most of my life.
But man,

284
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:37,070
that week was amazing and there
were other elements as well.

285
00:16:37,071 --> 00:16:41,630
But the main variable that I tweaked
was this tiny, tiny exercise.

286
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,960
And so in meditation,
as in everything else,

287
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:50,350
I think it pays to look for the very
little tweaks that have very big payoffs.

288
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,710
So hopefully that helps.

289
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:55,790
Those are a few of the things that helped
me to develop a mindfulness meditation

290
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:57,950
habit.
And last but not least,

291
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,190
if you meditate for a period of time
and then you fall off the train,

292
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,650
don't beat yourself up.
Just get back on the train.

293
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:08,360
It doesn't do any good to self
flagellate because you missed one or two

294
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:11,000
meditation sessions.
This isn't the Olympics of meditating.

295
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:13,330
So just get back on and uh,

296
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:17,210
then you will see the results and you
then have the recipe that you can use

297
00:17:17,211 --> 00:17:21,410
anytime you want. Thanks for
watching guys. I hope you enjoyed it.

298
