1
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:10,630
So I wanted to ask you if all the many,

2
00:00:10,631 --> 00:00:15,250
many things of the hundreds and thousands
of things that you could do with your

3
00:00:15,251 --> 00:00:16,084
time.

4
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:20,770
How did you get exposed to coding and,

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,850
and walk me through your first
experience or experiences with that.

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,440
Although I love the way that you,

7
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:29,380
you explain it as language
and that's really what it is.

8
00:00:29,381 --> 00:00:32,440
And I think that like any language,

9
00:00:32,441 --> 00:00:34,900
it's a medium that you
can express yourself,

10
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:37,630
that you can express creative ideas.

11
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:40,540
And that is what I,

12
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:42,700
why I think it's so powerful.

13
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:47,710
I got exposed to it because I'm
just a super curious, like annoying,

14
00:00:47,711 --> 00:00:49,120
like her curious person.

15
00:00:49,121 --> 00:00:53,230
I ask a lot of questions and I
love understanding how things work.

16
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:57,320
I love understanding like how
the world around me works and,

17
00:00:57,321 --> 00:01:00,820
and how science and math can
be ways to explain that. I,

18
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:05,150
but I work in a really creative
industry and, and I, I dunno,

19
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:08,890
I guess I at a certain point
in a couple of years ago,

20
00:01:08,891 --> 00:01:13,600
I wanted to understand what code was.
It was the term they kept hearing.

21
00:01:13,601 --> 00:01:17,020
Did it I person a
conversation. Yeah. I mean,

22
00:01:17,021 --> 00:01:18,820
I was meeting a lot of entrepreneurs,

23
00:01:18,821 --> 00:01:22,840
I was watching the entire world,

24
00:01:22,841 --> 00:01:26,980
especially fashion and media be
transformed by technology. And I was like,

25
00:01:26,981 --> 00:01:31,981
what is it that a handful of people
who are engineers and building huge

26
00:01:32,861 --> 00:01:33,850
enterprise value,

27
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:38,980
what is the sake secret language that
they know that the rest of us don't and

28
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:43,180
code. And I was like, what is code and
how can I learn it? So I took a boot camp,

29
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:45,670
I took one one week and even in where,

30
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,820
where was it in New York at the flat iron
school. Who introduced you to that? Um,

31
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:50,561
this guy,

32
00:01:50,561 --> 00:01:55,561
Avi fluff bomb and he's a great teacher
and he started this school and he taught

33
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,340
me ruby similar exactly as yeah.

34
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:01,360
So like it's a very intuitive
kind of language. And,

35
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:06,480
and even in a short time I was able
to kind of understand high level big

36
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:14,041
principles and the fact
that you can use code to,

37
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:19,720
you know, write a line of code that
performs a function and you can build,

38
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,660
you can build ideas using this language.

39
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:28,080
And that to me was just so mind blowing
to understand like how the tech that we

40
00:02:28,841 --> 00:02:32,680
touch every day, how it works
and to take it one step further,

41
00:02:32,681 --> 00:02:34,120
but to actually be able to,

42
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,260
to write it yourself and to express
your ideas and to be able to, I mean,

43
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:42,580
you're a man, you're so efficient,
Tim. It's really inspiring.

44
00:02:42,581 --> 00:02:46,390
You're so organized and so fishing
organized for maybe like two hours a day,

45
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,450
two hours and you are,
it's impressive.

46
00:02:49,451 --> 00:02:54,190
And I just think that like even you can
build tech to enable that and to scale

47
00:02:54,191 --> 00:02:54,850
that.

48
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:59,170
And that's what's so powerful is the
ability to scale ideas or scale problem

49
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,870
using code.
And,

50
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:07,470
and I think that there's so much
opportunity that has yet to really even be

51
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:13,450
built in this kind of
intersection of kind of, uh,

52
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:17,380
many intersections of,
of kind of creative industries with,

53
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:22,750
from the perspective of someone writing
code who has different life experiences

54
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,270
or passions may be then,
um,

55
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:30,300
then most engineers sitting in Silicon
Valley today and you take this class,

56
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:32,463
yeah.

57
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:37,040
You learn the basics of ruby with avi,

58
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:41,140
with Avi.
And how does the,

59
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:44,020
what is Kode with Klossy?
So Kode with Klossy

60
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:50,470
is my organization where we teach girls
to learn how to code and empower the

61
00:03:50,471 --> 00:03:52,480
next generation of tech leaders.

62
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,520
So we do that by running summer
camps across the country.

63
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:01,960
And we teach girls the ABC's.
So Ruby html,

64
00:04:01,961 --> 00:04:06,730
javascript, CSS, enough to
be able to build something.

65
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:10,540
So our camps are across the country and
there are two weeks long and they're

66
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,380
totally free.

67
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:16,860
And we have these amazing
girls who come into our,

68
00:04:16,971 --> 00:04:19,930
our,
our camps and learn these skills.

69
00:04:19,931 --> 00:04:22,450
And it's amazing what
they're able to build.

70
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,620
And not only just the way that
they're able to build their ideas,

71
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:31,750
but what they're passionate about. So
if it's like making social impact, uh,

72
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:34,420
helping their community, um, but they,

73
00:04:34,421 --> 00:04:38,740
they're able to build something and
recognize the impact that they can have.

74
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:43,810
Um, and that's really
empowering and that's that,

75
00:04:43,811 --> 00:04:47,290
that for a girl who's kind of,
you know,

76
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:51,490
at that point in life where you're like
figuring out what you think you can be

77
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:54,580
or what you think you can't,
like, that's really empowering.
