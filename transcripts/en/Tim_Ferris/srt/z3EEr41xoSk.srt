1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,790
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02,791 --> 00:00:06,010
I can run flat out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:08,823
No,

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,940
I'm a cybernetic organism living.

5
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,860
This episode is brought
to you by boll and branch,

6
00:00:25,861 --> 00:00:28,800
which is what I have on my
bed at home in San Francisco.

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,600
I use myself and there's a lot of
nonsense in the bedding business.

8
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:38,430
For instance, thread count, not a measure
of quality. Total myth. Egyptian cotton,

9
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:42,390
well guess what? It's a plant called
gossipy and Barbara didn't say,

10
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,850
I don't think that's how you say it,
but that is how I read it.

11
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:49,200
Generally not even grown in Egypt and
the made in Italy label that you're so

12
00:00:49,201 --> 00:00:50,040
proud of.
Well,

13
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,730
you know you shouldn't necessarily pay
extra for that because it often means

14
00:00:53,731 --> 00:00:56,970
that it's just finished in Italy
and woven in places like China.

15
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,100
The general industry markup for betting
is 700 to 800% at the usual retail

16
00:01:02,101 --> 00:01:04,470
stores.
You'd go to Boland branch,

17
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,580
which is B o l l is
incredibly high quality.

18
00:01:08,581 --> 00:01:11,040
They have a higher cost of
goods than many products.

19
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,270
You might buy it three to four x their
prices because they sell direct consumer,

20
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,133
so check it out.

21
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:21,440

Chicken out boll and
branch.com Promo Code Tim,

29
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:49,990
this episode is brought
to you by exo protein.

30
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:52,750
It's one of the startups that I work with.
I love what they do.

31
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,280
These guys are making protein bars
using crickets, protein powder,

32
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,250
and before you screw your
face up and look disgusted,

33
00:01:59,251 --> 00:02:02,220
I bet they taste better than any
protein bar you've ever had before.

34
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:06,060
I devour these bars after lifting
sessions. I take them with me on the road.

35
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,940
The recipes were developed by
a three Michelin Star Chef,

36
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,920
former head of r and d at the fat duck,

37
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,770
which was ranked the number one
restaurant in the world during his tenure.

38
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:18,820
The bars are paleo friendly, no gluten,
no grains, no soy, no dairy, et cetera.

39
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:23,310
They're high in protein and flavor and
extremely unique and they do not pop your

40
00:02:23,311 --> 00:02:25,650
glycemic response up oddly enough,

41
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:30,980
and you can look that up on line to
see some stories on that Ferrin Stein.

42
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,810
That's the journalist who
looked at it on top of all that.

43
00:02:33,811 --> 00:02:37,140
They are less processed than nearly all
protein bars. You'll be able to find.

44
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:40,620
This is your chance to see what the hype
is about and the founders were just on

45
00:02:40,621 --> 00:02:44,970
the Forbes 30 under 30 list and they are
offering a deep discount to Tim Ferriss

46

That's extra protein.com forward slash
Tim and I would doing it relatively fast

and that's not a bs scarcity thing.

52
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,610
They're startup with limited inventory
and they sell out all the time.

53
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,430
That is what happened last time I
mentioned them, so check it out.

Exo protein.com forward slash Tim

55
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,960
well greetings ladies and germs.

56
00:03:17,961 --> 00:03:20,960
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to
another episode of the Tim Ferriss show.

57
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:26,260
This is a shorter episode instead of a
long format interview with an expert of

58
00:03:26,421 --> 00:03:29,360
some type and we're
going to focus on Seneca,

59
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:32,240
my favorite stoic thinker
and author Seneca,

60
00:03:32,241 --> 00:03:36,170
the younger his writing that I'm going
to highlight and excerpt is roughly 2000

61
00:03:36,171 --> 00:03:37,004
years old.

62
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:42,100
Yet it is timeless and we are going
to listen to on the shortness of life.

63
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:45,770
This is an essay that I revisit
at least once a quarter,

64
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,410
along with all of his other
letters that you can listen to.

65
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:53,650
If you would like through the Tao of
seneca@audible.com forward slash Tim's

66
00:03:54,051 --> 00:03:58,160
books and this particular letter,
I will highlight my favorite portion,

67
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,110
which begins with quote,

68
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:05,090
why do you torment yourself and lose
weight over some problem dot, dot dot,

69
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,050
and on it goes.

70
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:11,500
This is a fantastic reminder to mind the
critical few to ignore the trivial many

71
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,070
and much, much more. I hope you enjoy it.

72
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:24,030
Letter 49 on the shortness of life

73
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:30,710
a man is indeed lazy and careless might
do Lucas if he has reminded of a friend

74
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:36,000
only by seeing some landscape
which there's the memory.

75
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,720
And yet there are times when the old
familiar haunts stir up a sense of loss

76
00:04:41,821 --> 00:04:46,290
that has been stored away in the soul,
not bringing back dead memories,

77
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:51,630
but rousing them from their dormant
state just as the site of lost friends,

78
00:04:51,631 --> 00:04:56,631
favorite slave or his cloak or his
house renews the mourners grief,

79
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,940
even though it has been softened
by time. Now, Lo and behold,

80
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Campania and especially Naples in your
beloved Pompei struck me when I viewed

81
00:05:07,761 --> 00:05:11,030
them with a wonderfully fresh
sense of longing for you.

82
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,670
You stand in full view before my eyes.

83
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,190
I am on the point of parting from you.

84
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:21,690
I see you choking down your tears
and resisting without success.

85
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,830
The emotions that well up at the very
moment when you try to check them,

86
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:31,440
I seem to have lost you but
a moment ago for what is not,

87
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:35,340
but a moment ago when one
begins to use the memory.

88
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:40,710
It was about a moment ago that I sat as
a lad in the school of the philosopher

89
00:05:40,711 --> 00:05:44,430
Celltrion, but a moment ago that
I began to plead in the courts,

90
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:47,850
but a moment ago that I
lost the desire to plead,

91
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:53,630
but a moment ago that I lost the ability
infinitely swift as the flight of time.

92
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:00,760
As those see more clearly are looking
backwards for when we are intent on the

93
00:06:00,801 --> 00:06:03,110
present,
we do not notice it.

94
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,070
So gentle is the passage
of times headlong flight.

95
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,260
Do you ask?

96
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:13,670
The reason for this all past
time is in the same place.

97
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,780
It all presents the same aspect to us.
It lies together.

98
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:24,490
Everything slips into the same abyss
besides an event which in its entirety as

99
00:06:25,971 --> 00:06:29,330
of brief,
compass cannot contain long intervals.

100
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,080
The time which we spend in living is
about a point nay even less than a point,

101
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:37,760
but at this point of time,

102
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:42,970
infant decimal method is nature has marked
by making it seem outwardly of longer

103
00:06:43,881 --> 00:06:44,714
duration.

104
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:49,820
She has taken one portion thereof and
made it infancy and other childhood,

105
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,600
another youth, another the
gradual slope, so to speak,

106
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:58,750
from youth to old age and old age itself
is still another how many steps for how

107
00:07:00,591 --> 00:07:02,960
shorter climb it was.

108
00:07:02,961 --> 00:07:07,550
But a moment ago that I saw you off on
your journey and yet this moment ago

109
00:07:07,551 --> 00:07:11,270
makes up a goodly share of our existence,
which is so brief.

110
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:16,390
We should reflect that it will soon come
to an end all together in other years.

111
00:07:17,451 --> 00:07:21,440
Time did not seem to me to go so swiftly.
Now,

112
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:26,860
it seems fast to beyond belief perhaps
because I feel that the finish line is

113
00:07:27,171 --> 00:07:32,171
moving closer to me or it may be that I
have begun to take heed and racking up

114
00:07:32,871 --> 00:07:35,510
my losses.
For this reason,

115
00:07:35,511 --> 00:07:40,511
I am all the more angry that some men
claim the major portion of this time for

116
00:07:40,731 --> 00:07:45,050
superfluous things, time, which
no matter how carefully it is,

117
00:07:45,051 --> 00:07:48,380
guarded cannot suffice
even for necessary things.

118
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:52,940
CICERO declared that if the
number of his days were doubled,

119
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:58,010
he should not have the time to read the
lyric poets and you may rate the dialect

120
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:02,960
Titian's in the same class, but they
are foolish and a more melancholy way.

121
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,410
The lyric poets are avowedly frivolous,

122
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:11,120
but the dialect Titian's believe that
they are themselves engaged upon serious

123
00:08:11,121 --> 00:08:15,320
business.
I do not deny that one must cast a glance,

124
00:08:15,321 --> 00:08:20,321
a dialectic where it ought to be a mere
glands or sort of greeting from the

125
00:08:20,811 --> 00:08:25,760
threshold merely that one
may not be deceived or judge
these pursuits to contain

126
00:08:25,761 --> 00:08:27,500
any hidden matters of great worth.

127
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:32,630
Why do you torment yourself and
lose weight over some problem,

128
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:35,960
which it is more clever to
have scorned than to solve.

129
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,800
When a soldier is undisturbed
and traveling at his ease,

130
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,440
he can hunt for trifles along his way,

131
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:47,480
but when the enemy is closing in on the
rear and a command is given to quicken

132
00:08:47,481 --> 00:08:48,260
the pace,

133
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:52,100
necessity makes him throw away everything
which he picked up in moments of peace

134
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:53,203
and leisure.

135
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:59,170
I have no time to investigate disputed
inflections of words or to try my cunning

136
00:08:59,761 --> 00:09:03,690
upon them. Behold, the gathering clans,

137
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:08,910
the fast shut gates and weapons
wetted ready for the war.

138
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:15,030
I need a stout heart to hear without
flinching this din of battle,

139
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:20,270
which sounds roundabout and all would
rightly think me mad if when gray beards

140
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:25,590
and women were heaping up rocks for
the fortifications when the armor clad

141
00:09:25,591 --> 00:09:30,390
youths inside the gates were awaiting
or even demanding the order for a Sally

142
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:35,280
when the spears of the foam and were
quivering in our gates and the very ground

143
00:09:35,281 --> 00:09:38,190
was rocking with minds
and subterranean passages,

144
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:43,020
I say they would rightly think
me mad if I were to sit idle.

145
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:48,510
Putting such pretty posers as this
what you have not lost. You have,

146
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,910
but you have not lost any horns.

147
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:56,330
Therefore you have horns or other tricks
constructed after the model of this

148
00:09:57,001 --> 00:10:02,001
piece of sheer silliness and yet I may
well seem in your eyes no less mad if I

149
00:10:03,601 --> 00:10:07,170
spend my energies on that sort of thing.
For even now,

150
00:10:07,171 --> 00:10:12,171
I am in a state of siege and yet in the
former case it would be merely apparel

151
00:10:13,021 --> 00:10:13,920
from the outside,

152
00:10:13,921 --> 00:10:18,921
the threatened me and a wall that sundered
me from the foe as it is now death

153
00:10:19,741 --> 00:10:22,140
dealing perils or in my very presence,

154
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:27,690
I have no time for such nonsense.
A mighty undertaking is on my hands.

155
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,310
What am I to do?

156
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,480
Death is on my trail and
life is fleeting away.

157
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:38,460
Teach me something with which to face
these troubles, bring it to pass,

158
00:10:38,461 --> 00:10:42,720
that I shall cease trying to escape from
death and that life may cease to escape

159
00:10:42,721 --> 00:10:46,530
from me.
Give me courage to meet hardships.

160
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:49,230
Make me call him in the
face of the unavoidable,

161
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:52,980
relax the straightened limits of
the time which has allotted me.

162
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:57,200
Show me that the good in life does
not depend upon life's length,

163
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,600
but upon the use we make of it also that
it is possible or rather usual for a

164
00:11:03,721 --> 00:11:08,721
man who has lived long to have lived
two little say to me when I lie down to

165
00:11:09,241 --> 00:11:10,074
sleep,

166
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:15,380
you may not wake again and when I
return you may never go forth again.

167
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:22,260
You are mistaken if you think that
only on an ocean voyage there is a very

168
00:11:22,261 --> 00:11:26,580
slight space between life and death.
No,

169
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:32,040
the distance between is just as narrow
everywhere. It is not everywhere.

170
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:34,200
That death shows himself so near at hand,

171
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:37,590
yet everywhere he has as near at hand

172
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,610
rid me of the shadowy terrors,

173
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,310
then you will more easily delivered to me.

174
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:49,610
The instruction for which I have prepared
myself at our birth nature made us

175
00:11:49,861 --> 00:11:53,290
teachable and gave us reason not perfect,

176
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:58,390
but capable of being perfected.
Discuss for me justice,

177
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:01,510
duty thrift and that two fold purity,

178
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:06,160
both the purity which abstains
from another person and
that which takes care of

179
00:12:06,161 --> 00:12:07,210
one's own self.

180
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:13,020
If you will only refuse to lead me along
bypaths I shall more easily reached the

181
00:12:13,331 --> 00:12:17,740
goal at which I am aiming for.
As the tragic poet says,

182
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,270
the language of truth is simple.

183
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:28,860
We should not therefore make that language
intricate since there is nothing less

184
00:12:29,651 --> 00:12:34,450
fitting for a soul of great endeavor
than such crafty cleverness.

185
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,753
Farewell.

186
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,690
Hey guys, this is Tim again. Just a
few more things before you take off.

187
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:44,660
Number one,
this is five bullet Friday.

188
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,930
Do you want to get a short email from me?

189
00:12:47,931 --> 00:12:52,070
Would you enjoy getting a short email
from me every Friday that provides a

190
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:55,640
little more soul of fun before the
weekend and five bullet Friday is a very

191
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:59,960
short email where I share the coolest
things I've found or that I've been

192
00:12:59,961 --> 00:13:01,250
pondering over the week.

193
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:04,250
That could include favorite new
albums that I've discovered.

194
00:13:04,251 --> 00:13:07,700
It could include Gizmos and gadgets
and all sorts of weird shit that I've

195
00:13:07,701 --> 00:13:12,020
somehow dug up in the, uh, the
world of the esoteric as I do.

196
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,320
It could include favorite articles that
I've read and that I've shared with my

197
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:20,690
close friends, for instance.
And it's very short.

198
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:25,760
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness
before you head off for the weekend,

199
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,980
so if you want to receive that,
check it out.

200
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:32,930
Just go to a four hour work week.com
that's four hour work week.com all spelled

201
00:13:32,931 --> 00:13:36,800
out and just drop in your email and you
will get the very next one and if you

202
00:13:36,801 --> 00:13:41,570
sign up, I hope you enjoy it. This
episode is brought to you by exo protein.

203
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:44,270
It's one of the startups that I
work with and love what they do.

204
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:47,840
These guys are making protein bars
using crickets, protein powder,

205
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,840
and before you screw your
face up and look disgusted,

206
00:13:50,841 --> 00:13:53,750
I bet they taste better than any
protein bar you've ever had before.

207
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:57,590
I devour these bars after lifting
sessions. I take them with me on the road.

208
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,530
The recipes were developed by
a three Michelin Star Chef,

209
00:14:00,531 --> 00:14:02,420
former head of r and d at the fat duck,

210
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:06,050
which was ranked the number one restaurant
in the world during his tenure bars

211
00:14:06,051 --> 00:14:10,400
or paleo friendly, no gluten, no
grains, no soy, no dairy, et cetera.

212
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:14,720
They are high in protein and flavor and
extremely unique and they do not pop

213
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:17,240
your glycemic response up oddly enough,

214
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,600
and you can look that up on line to
see some stories on that Ferran Stein,

215
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:25,340
that's the journalist who
looked at it on top of all that.

216
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:28,700
They're less processed than nearly all
protein bars. You'll be able to find.

217
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,210
This is your chance to see what the hype
is about and the founders were just on

218
00:14:32,211 --> 00:14:36,560
the Forbes 30 under 30 list and they are
offering a deep discount to Tim Ferriss

219
00:14:36,561 --> 00:14:37,161
show listeners.

220
00:14:37,161 --> 00:14:42,161
If you go to exo protein.com forward
slash 10 minutes e x o protein.com/tim

221
00:14:42,651 --> 00:14:43,340
today,

222
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,820
you can try a sampler pack with all of
their most popular flavors for less than

223
00:14:46,821 --> 00:14:47,630
10 bucks.

224
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:52,040
That's exo protein.com forward slash
Tim and I would recommend it relatively

225
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,010
fast and that's not a bs scarcity thing.

226
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:58,130
They're startup with limited inventory
and they sell out all the time.

227
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:01,620
That is what happened last time I
mentioned them, so check it out. EXO,

228
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,980
protein.com forward slash.
Tim,

229
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:07,070
this episode is brought
to you by boll and branch,

230
00:15:07,071 --> 00:15:10,040
which is what I have on my
bed at home in San Francisco.

231
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:14,840
I use myself and there's a lot of
nonsense in the bedding business.

232
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:19,640
For instance, thread count, not a measure
of quality. Total myth. Egyptian cotton,

233
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:23,630
well guess what? It's a plant called
gossip and Barbara didn't say,

234
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:26,060
I don't think that's how you said,
but that is how I read it.

235
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,440
Generally not even grown in Egypt and
the made in Italy label that you're so

236
00:15:30,441 --> 00:15:31,274
proud of.
Well,

237
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:34,940
you know you shouldn't necessarily pay
extra for that because it often means

238
00:15:34,941 --> 00:15:38,180
that it's just finished in Italy
and woven in places like China.

239
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:43,340
The general industry mark up for betting
is 700 to 800% at the usual retail

240
00:15:43,341 --> 00:15:46,430
stores. You'd go to Boll
and branch, which is B o.

241
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:49,790
L l is incredibly high quality.

242
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:52,280
They have a higher cost of
goods than many products.

243
00:15:52,281 --> 00:15:56,000
You might buy it three to four x their
prices because they sell direct to

244
00:15:56,001 --> 00:16:00,380
consumer. So check it out. Go to
boll and branch.com that's B, O,

245
00:16:00,381 --> 00:16:03,080

and not that you'd need to,

247
