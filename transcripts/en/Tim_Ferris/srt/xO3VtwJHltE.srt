1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,790
Optimal.
At this altitude,

2
00:00:02,791 --> 00:00:05,970
I can run flat out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:13,530
I'm a cybernetic organism,

4
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,830
so does brought to you by headspace.

5
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,040
More than 80% of the
people I've interviewed,

6
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,240
world class performers across
the military, entertainment,

7
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,100
sports, and beyond all have some
type of meditative practice.

8
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,280
I tried for years and
years and failed miserably.

9
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:45,300
The key is making it simple and you can
dramatically improve your life in just

10
00:00:45,301 --> 00:00:47,160
10 minutes a day and
technology can help you.

11
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:51,630
This change comes through
guided meditation and
headspace is by far the most

12
00:00:51,631 --> 00:00:56,010
popular app for this purpose.
More than 4 million users.

13
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,630
It's meditation made simple,

14
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,110
so what I recommend is that you
take this practice meditation,

15
00:01:01,111 --> 00:01:02,940
which is rooted in thousands
of years of tradition,

16
00:01:02,941 --> 00:01:07,941
supported by thousands of
scientific studies and try
it for 10 minutes a day for

17
00:01:09,001 --> 00:01:11,250
10 days.
That's all you need to do.

18

24
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,590

26
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:46,230
this episode is brought to
you by Wealthfront and this
is a very unique sponsor.

27
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:51,000
Wealthfront is a massively disruptive,
in a good way, set it and forget it.

28
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:55,350
Investing service led by technologists
from places like apple and world famous

29
00:01:55,351 --> 00:01:56,070
investors.

30
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:59,790
It has exploded in popularity in the last
two years and they now have more than

31
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:02,820
two and a half billion dollars
under management. In fact,

32
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,170
some of my very good friends,

33
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,380
investors in silicon valley have millions
of their own money in Wealthfront.

34
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,440
So the question is, why? Why is
it so popular? Why is it unique?

35
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:14,730
Because you can get services previously
reserved for the ultra wealthy but only

36
00:02:14,731 --> 00:02:16,740
pay pennies on the dollar for them.

37
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,460
And this is because they use smarter
software instead of retail locations,

38
00:02:20,461 --> 00:02:23,190
bloated sales teams, et cetera. And
I'll come back to that in a second.

39
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:28,350
I suggest you check out wealthfront.com
forward slash Tim take the risk

40
00:02:28,351 --> 00:02:29,101
assessment quiz,

41
00:02:29,101 --> 00:02:33,000
which only takes two to five minutes and
they'll show you for free exactly the

42
00:02:33,001 --> 00:02:35,940
portfolio they'd put you in.
And if you just want to take their advice,

43
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,330
run with it, do it yourself.
You can do that or as I would,

44
00:02:39,331 --> 00:02:41,250
you can set it and forget it.
And here's why.

45
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,540
The value of Wealthfront is in the
automation of habits and strategies that

46
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:48,960
investors should be using on a
regular basis but normally aren't.

47
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,630
Great investing is a marathon,
not a sprint,

48
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,940
and little things that you may
or may not be familiar with.

49
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:57,450
Like automatic tax loss harvesting,
rebalancing your portfolio,

50
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:01,930
cross more than 10 asset classes and
dividend reinvestment add up to very large

51
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:05,650
amounts of money over longer periods
of time. Wealthfront, as I mentioned,

52
00:03:05,651 --> 00:03:08,260
since it's using software
instead of retail locations,

53
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:12,430
etc. Can offer all of this at low
costs that were previously completely

54
00:03:12,431 --> 00:03:13,930
impossible.
Right off the bat,

55
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,480
you never pay commissions or
account fees for everything.

56
00:03:16,481 --> 00:03:21,481
They charge 0.25% per year on assets above
the first 15,000 which is managed for

57
00:03:22,121 --> 00:03:24,130
free.
If you use my link,

58
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:28,510
wealthfront.com forward slash Tim that
is less than $5 a month to invest a

59
00:03:28,511 --> 00:03:30,250
$30,000 account for instance.

60
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,030
Now normally when I have a sponsor on
this show is because I use them and

61
00:03:34,031 --> 00:03:36,130
recommend them.
In this case it's a little different.

62
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:40,420
I don't use wealth front yet because
I'm not allowed to. Here's the deal.

63
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:44,680
They wanted to sponsor this podcast,
but because of sec regulations,

64
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:48,370
companies that invest your money are
not allowed to use client testimonials.

65
00:03:48,371 --> 00:03:51,160
So I couldn't be a user end
have them on the podcast,

66
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:55,270
but I've been so impressed by Wealthfront
that I've invested a significant

67
00:03:55,271 --> 00:03:59,140
amount of my own money, at least for me,
uh, in the team and the company itself.

68
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:02,260
So I am an investor and hope
to soon use it as a client.

69
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:05,770
Now back to the recommendation
as a Tim Ferriss show listener,

70
00:04:05,771 --> 00:04:09,640
you'll get $15,000 managed for free
if you decide to open an account,

71
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,670
but just start with seeing the portfolio
that they would suggest for you.

72
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:16,840
Take two minutes, fill out their
questionnaire@wealthfront.com
forward slash. Tim.

73
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,960
It's fast, it's free. There's
no downside that I can think of.

74
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,510
Now I do have to read
a mandatory disclaimer.

75
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:26,350
Wealthfront Inc is an SEC
registered investment advisor.

76
00:04:26,351 --> 00:04:29,380
Investing in securities involves risks
and there's the possibility of losing

77
00:04:29,381 --> 00:04:31,570
money. Past performance is no
guarantee of future results.

79
00:04:36,191 --> 00:04:37,540
This is one of the hottest,

80
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:41,380
most innovative companies coming out of
Silicon Valley and they're killing it.

81
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:44,410
They've become massively popular.
Just take a look,

82
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,710

for you and you can use that information

Hello boys and girls.

85
00:04:54,431 --> 00:04:57,250
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to
another episode of the Tim Ferriss show.

86
00:04:57,251 --> 00:05:01,210
It is usually my job to deconstruct
world class performers of some type,

87
00:05:01,211 --> 00:05:05,800
whether they are from sports,
military, chess, entertainment,

88
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,190
God knows where they come from everywhere
and you find a lot of commonalities

89
00:05:09,191 --> 00:05:11,740
across them.
This episode though is a special episode.

90
00:05:11,741 --> 00:05:14,530
I'm going to hand the mic over to Seneca,

91
00:05:14,531 --> 00:05:18,910
the younger and what you are going to
hear is roughly 2000 years old and it

92
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:23,970
teaches you how to deconstruct
or construct a world class life.

93
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:27,790
And suffice to say,
Seneca and his letters,

94
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:32,000
I've had an enormous impact on my
life. I revisit his writing, uh,

95
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:37,080
many dozens of times per year and this
particular letter has affected me in

96
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:42,430
myriad of ways,
litter 18 on festivals and fasting.

97
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:47,560
And I want you to pay particular attention
to a few passages that began around

98
00:05:47,561 --> 00:05:52,561
two minutes and 20 seconds in with the
line set aside a certain number of days

99
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:58,170
and what this will teach you and Elucidat
is how to practice poverty and reduce

100
00:05:58,461 --> 00:05:59,420
fear.
Specifically,

101
00:05:59,421 --> 00:06:04,160
you can think of it as
inoculating yourself against
fear by practicing the worst

102
00:06:04,161 --> 00:06:05,090
case scenarios.

103
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:10,420
This is a an incredibly powerful concept
that you can rehearse the things that

104
00:06:11,661 --> 00:06:15,680
you fear to take the fear away
from them and out of yourself.

105
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:19,820
It is extremely practical and I
do this with short term fasting,

106
00:06:19,821 --> 00:06:22,070
which of course you shouldn't
do without medical supervision.

107
00:06:22,071 --> 00:06:24,200
I'm going to say that I'm not a doctor,
don't play one on the Internet.

108
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:28,610
I do that with wearing the same clothing
for instance and like white tee shirt

109
00:06:28,611 --> 00:06:33,200
and jeans for a week or so. Or you
could do it by eating very cheap food,

110
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:34,880
rice and beans for instance,

111
00:06:34,881 --> 00:06:38,720
two to $3 a day in total cost for a week,

112
00:06:38,721 --> 00:06:43,430
but I will let Seneca get into it because
he will do a much better job than I

113
00:06:43,431 --> 00:06:47,930
could ever dare to attempt. I implore
you to listen to more of these letters.

114
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:53,230
The 27 hours or so of audio that I
just put out is in the Tao of Seneca.

115
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,430
This is not a big money maker for me.

116
00:06:55,431 --> 00:06:58,190
It's something I've wanted to do for
decades just to make these letters

117
00:06:58,191 --> 00:07:01,850
available to you guys in
audio format so you can do it.

118
00:07:01,851 --> 00:07:06,851
Say on the way to coffee or on the way
to work once per day in the morning,

119
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,390
you can digest one of these letters
and they can set you up for optimal

120
00:07:11,391 --> 00:07:16,010
performance in high stress situations
so you don't overly react and hurt

121
00:07:16,011 --> 00:07:16,844
yourself and others.

122
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:22,150
So you can check out the
town of seneca@audible.com
forward slash Tim's books.

123
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,900
Check it out.
You can listen to samples.

124
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,320
And for those of you who
downloaded it a few days ago,

125
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:31,310
there was an issue with the longer
on the shortness of life essay.

126
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,800
So you can skip that.
We're going to be removing it,

127
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,560
but all the other letters
should be in fine form.

128
00:07:36,561 --> 00:07:40,670
And this is one of my favorites. Like I
said, letter 18 on festivals and fasting.

129
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:45,490
Pay Attention. It's changed my life. I
think he can do the same for you. And uh,

130
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:48,650
if you want additional resources, I will
try to include them in the show notes.

131
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:53,060
So four hour work week.com forward

133
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:04,820
letter h on festivals and fasting.

134
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:13,140
It is the month of December and yet the
city is at this very moment in a sweat

135
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:18,920
licenses given to the general merrymaking
everything resounds with mighty

136
00:08:18,921 --> 00:08:23,570
preparations as if the Saturnalia differed
at all from the usual business day.

137
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,041
So true.

138
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:29,150
It is that the difference is nil that I
regard as correct at the remark of the

139
00:08:29,151 --> 00:08:34,100
man who said once December, it
was a month. Now it is a year.

140
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,950
If I had you with me,

141
00:08:36,951 --> 00:08:40,850
I should be glad to consult you and
find out what you think should be done,

142
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:46,310
whether we ought to make no change in
our daily routine or whether in order not

143
00:08:46,311 --> 00:08:48,500
to be out of sympathy with
the ways of the public,

144
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:54,070
we should dine and gay or fashion
and off the Toca as it is now.

145
00:08:54,381 --> 00:08:58,800
We Romans have changed our dress for
the sake of pleasure and holiday making

146
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:03,900
though in former times that was only
customary when the state was disturbed and

147
00:09:03,901 --> 00:09:05,370
had fallen on evil days.

148
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:10,770
I am sure that if I know you are
right playing the part of an umpire,

149
00:09:10,771 --> 00:09:14,580
you would have wished that we should be
neither liked the liberty cap wrong in

150
00:09:14,581 --> 00:09:17,520
all ways.
Nowhere in all ways unlike them,

151
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:22,590
unless perhaps this is just the season
when we ought to lay down the law to the

152
00:09:22,591 --> 00:09:27,570
soul and bid it be alone in refraining
from pleasures just when the whole mob

153
00:09:27,571 --> 00:09:32,490
has led itself go and pleasures for this
is the surest proof which a man can get

154
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:37,200
his own constancy if he neither seeks to
things which are seductive and a lower

155
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:40,080
him to luxury nor is led into them.

156
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:45,690
It shows much more courage to remain
dry and sober when the mob is drunk and

157
00:09:45,691 --> 00:09:46,524
vomiting,

158
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:51,870
but it shows greater self control to
refuse to withdraw oneself and to do what

159
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:55,710
the crowd does, but in
a different way. Thus,

160
00:09:55,711 --> 00:10:00,711
neither making oneself conspicuous nor
becoming one of the crowd for one may

161
00:10:01,441 --> 00:10:04,440
keep holiday without extravagance.

162
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,230
I am so firmly determined. However,
to test the constancy of your mind,

163
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:13,230
that drawing from the
teachings of great men,

164
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,800
I shall give you also a lesson set aside
a certain number of days during which

165
00:10:19,981 --> 00:10:21,650
you shall be content with a scan,

166
00:10:21,651 --> 00:10:26,651
TST and cheapest fare with coarse and
rough dress saying to yourself the while

167
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:30,200
is this,
the condition that I feared,

168
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:36,270
it is precisely in times of immunity
from care that the soul should toughen

169
00:10:36,271 --> 00:10:40,770
itself beforehand for occasions
of greater stress and it is wild.

170
00:10:40,771 --> 00:10:44,670
Fortune is kind that it should
fortify itself against her violence.

171
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,300
In days of peace,
the soldier performs maneuvers,

172
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:53,490
throws up earthworks with no enemy in
sight and wearies himself by gratuitous

173
00:10:53,491 --> 00:10:57,600
toil in order that he may be
equal to unavoidable toil.

174
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:01,290
If you would not have a man
flinched when the crisis comes,

175
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,230
train him before it comes,

176
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,080
such as the course which
those men have followed,

177
00:11:07,081 --> 00:11:12,081
who in their imitation of poverty have
every month come almost to want that they

178
00:11:12,331 --> 00:11:15,300
might never recoil from what
they had so often rehearsed.

179
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:21,330
You need not suppose that,
I mean meals like to moans or poppers,

180
00:11:21,331 --> 00:11:26,331
huts or any other device which luxuries
millionaires use to beguile the tedium

181
00:11:27,301 --> 00:11:28,230
of their lives.

182
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:32,510
Let the pallet be a real
one and the course cloak.

183
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:35,610
Let the bread be hard and grimy.

184
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:39,450
Endure all this for three
or four days at a time,

185
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:44,790
sometimes for more that it may be a test
of yourself instead of a mere hobby.

186
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:48,120
Then I assure you my dear Luke Ileus,

187
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,350
you will leap for joy when filled with
a penny worth of food and you will

188
00:11:52,351 --> 00:11:57,351
understand that a man's peace of mind
does not depend upon fortune for even when

189
00:11:58,271 --> 00:12:01,270
angry she grants enough for our needs.

190
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,000
There is no reason,
however,

191
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:08,380
why you should think that you were doing
anything great for you will merely be

192
00:12:08,381 --> 00:12:13,240
doing what many thousands of slaves and
many thousands of poor men are doing

193
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,380
every day.

194
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:20,310
But you may credit yourself with this
item that you will not be doing it under

195
00:12:20,411 --> 00:12:25,240
compulsion and that it will be as easy
for you to endure it permanently as to

196
00:12:25,241 --> 00:12:27,430
make the experiment from time to time.

197
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,610
Let us practice our strokes on the dummy.

198
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:35,890
Let us become intimate with poverty so
that fortune may not catch us off our

199
00:12:35,891 --> 00:12:36,724
guard,

200
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:41,620
which will be rich with all
the more comfort if we once
learn how far poverty is

201
00:12:41,621 --> 00:12:42,820
from being a burden.

202
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:48,840
Even Epicurus the teacher of pleasure
used to observe stated intervals during

203
00:12:49,631 --> 00:12:52,480
which he satisfied his
hunger in niggardly fashion.

204
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:57,130
He wished to see whether he thereby fell
short of full and complete happiness,

205
00:12:57,131 --> 00:12:57,964
and if so,

206
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:02,890
by what amount he fell short and whether
this amount was worth purchasing at the

207
00:13:02,891 --> 00:13:06,190
price of great effort.
At any rate,

208
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,850
he makes such a statement in the well
known letter written to poly noose in the

209
00:13:09,851 --> 00:13:12,610
Orrcon ship of Karina Rhinos.
Indeed,

210
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,700
he boasts that he himself
lived on less than a penny,

211
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,750
but that Metro Dorros who is
progress was not yet so great.

212
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,490
Needed a whole penny.

213
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:26,530
Do you think that there can
be fullness on such fair? Yes,

214
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:31,390
and there was a pleasure also not
that shifty and fleeting pleasure,

215
00:13:31,391 --> 00:13:33,010
which needs a Philip now and then,

216
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:37,510
but a pleasure that is steadfast
and sure four though, water,

217
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:41,800
barley meal and crusts of barley bread,
or not a cheerful diet,

218
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:46,630
yet it is the highest kind of pleasure
to be able to derive pleasure from.
