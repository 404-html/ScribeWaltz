00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,080
Hey guys, Tim Ferriss here.
Before we jump into this episode,

2
00:00:04,081 --> 00:00:09,081
I'm going to do something I very rarely
do and that is to make a direct ask with

3
00:00:09,931 --> 00:00:13,740
Hatton hand,
my brand new book just came out today.

4
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,320
It is called tribe of mentors,
subtitle,

5
00:00:16,321 --> 00:00:19,800
short life advice from the best in
the world. If you like the podcast,

6
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,050
you will love this book.

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,850
I reached out to 130 people who are
the best at what they do in sports

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,500
investing, business, acting,
directing, you name it. We got it,

9
00:00:31,501 --> 00:00:36,501
cryptocurrency done and it turned out
better than I ever could have expected.

10
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,410
Many of my friends think of all my books.
It is the easiest to read,

11
00:00:40,411 --> 00:00:43,950
the easiest to use, so check
it out. Please take a look.

12
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,040
I put out so much free material.
The podcast is free.

13
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,380
The 700 plus blog posts are free.

14
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:53,640
Every once in awhile I put out something
like this and it's not that expensive,

15
00:00:53,641 --> 00:00:54,450
so please take a look.

16
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:59,450
Tribe of mentors.com and it does make a
great holiday gift or gift for others.

17
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,880
There's something for everybody in here.

18
00:01:02,881 --> 00:01:05,520
It is really a choose
your own adventure guide,

19
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,850
a buffet of options for
improving your life,

20
00:01:08,851 --> 00:01:13,140
both in business and in the
personal sphere. So take a look.

21
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,430
I appreciate you taking a look.

22
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,640
Tribe of mentors.com or
anywhere that books are sold

23
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,850
optimal. At this altitude, I can

24
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:24,873
start shaking.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,190
I'm a cybernetic organism,
living tissue.

26
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,270
This episode is brought
to you by me undies.

27
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:48,030
I've spent the last few years
wearing underwear from these guys,

28
00:01:48,031 --> 00:01:52,570
24 seven or close to it outside of showers
and sexy time and swimming and they

29
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:56,160
are the most comfortable and
colorful underwear I've ever owned.

30
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,250
You just check out the camouflage
boxer briefs. I'm a big fan.

31
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:04,440
Me undies are designed in La and made
from sustainably sourced micro Madell.

32
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,220
What's that? It is a fabric of three
times softer than cotton. Trust me.

33
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,130
Try it out. You'll understand
why I wear these so much.

34
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,810
If underwear isn't your thing though,

35
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,480
like I would imagine everyone wears
underwear, but if it isn't your thing,

36
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:20,070
Mandy's also makes socks. Their
socks are spun from premium material,

37
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:24,930
making them just as comfortable
as the underwear. Now, right now,

38
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:28,800

This episode is brought to you
by fresh books, man, oh man.

48
00:03:04,731 --> 00:03:09,230
Do a lot of listeners to this podcast
and readers of mine love fresh books to

49
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:12,860
the extent that I ended up meeting
with the CEO not very long ago.

50
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,020
Why are they so popular?
Well,

51
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,220
they are the number one cloud accounting
software designed exclusively for self

52
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,600
employed professionals.

53
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:23,360
That's many of you and used by
more than 10 million people.

54
00:03:23,361 --> 00:03:27,350
You can send invoices, track your
time, and get paid very, very quickly,

55
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:31,970
which suits the needs of a
lot of freelancers, a lot
of [inaudible] and beyond.

56
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:34,220
You can't take pictures of receipts.

57
00:03:34,221 --> 00:03:35,690
You can link your credit
card and debit card.

58
00:03:35,691 --> 00:03:40,670
So all the things you buy automatically
appear in your fresh books in the right

59
00:03:40,671 --> 00:03:44,270
category, so on and so forth. Makes
taxes easy, makes invoices easy,

60
00:03:44,271 --> 00:03:48,950
it makes your life easier. And also
in fact, I would recommend a pdf.

61
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,900
Uh, they didn't ask me to
read this part by the way.

62
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:55,730
They'd put together a pdf a while back
called breaking the time barrier subtitle,

63
00:03:55,731 --> 00:03:58,760
how to unlock your true earning potential
so you can search for breaking the

64
00:03:58,761 --> 00:04:01,010
time barrier.
A lot of people ask me,

65
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,520
how can I get a four hour work
week with a service business?

66
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:08,660
And the story in that Ebook, it's
pdf, is the short answer. It's really,

67
00:04:08,661 --> 00:04:11,060
really good.
So I think you should also check that out.

68
00:04:11,061 --> 00:04:15,620
So breaking the time error, check it out,
but also why not test out freshbooks?

71
00:04:26,421 --> 00:04:30,950
That sounds like we're going to get very
little tracking and it's a lot of work,

Yeah.

76
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,590
Why?
Hello Ladies and germs.

77
00:04:47,591 --> 00:04:50,680
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another
episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

78
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:55,630
it is my job each and every episode to
deconstruct world class performers from

79
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:59,950
every possible domain.
Whether we're talking about entertainment,

80
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:02,140
military,
athletics,

81
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:07,290
business or in this case something a
little bit different to tease out the

82
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,850
habits,
maybe routines,

83
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:14,851
maybe techniques definitely that you
can use and apply in your own life.

84
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:22,260
Now the subject matter and interviewee
in this episode I suppose could be

85
00:05:23,051 --> 00:05:28,051
introduced at least should be introduced
I think with a quote and that is those

86
00:05:28,481 --> 00:05:31,270
who are easily shocked
should be shocked more often.

87
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:33,490
That is by Mae West.

88
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:38,550
So if you find yourself getting a little
offended or find yourself recoiling or

89
00:05:40,091 --> 00:05:44,140
leaning forward with great
interest and enthusiasm,

90
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,540
notice that,
notice all of those things.

91
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:51,870
This is an unusual interview and it
came about because I was walking through

92
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,880
Dallas airport,

93
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:58,820
I want to say at one point to catch
connecting flight and I got a text from a

94
00:05:58,821 --> 00:06:03,050
friend and that the texts it Tim,
exclamation point, exclamation point,

95
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,550
hope all is well with you.

96
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:08,660
I have an interesting guest you might
consider for the show Alice Little top

97
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:12,620
earning core doesn't for the bunny
ranch long backstory on how I know her,

98
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,240
but seven figure earners, super smart.
He would definitely be out of left field.

99
00:06:17,241 --> 00:06:20,000
Let me know if I can make the intro.
Now for those of you who don't know,

100
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:25,310
the bunny ranch is a
legal brothel in Nevada,

101
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:30,140
so I received this text from Rob Wolf.

102
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:34,700
Yes, that's right. Rob, last
name Wolf, w o l f Robb,

103
00:06:34,701 --> 00:06:39,230
wolf.com. You can check him out. He is
the philosopher, king of the Paleo world.

104
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,680
And I will let rob explain why
he knows Alice some other time,

105
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:50,030
but I get this text. So
of course I say yes, yes,

106
00:06:50,031 --> 00:06:53,750
yes. Is she a good conversation? Zero
to 10. How good at storytelling is she?

107
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:57,560
And one thing led to
another and then boom,

108
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,410
I was connected with Alice.

109
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,790
So Alice Little on Twitter at the Alis,

110
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:08,990
little is considered the number one top
earning legal sex worker in the United

111
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:10,580
States.
She is a four foot eight,

112
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:15,560
hence Ellis little legal sex worker at
Nevada's world famous moonlight bunny

113
00:07:15,561 --> 00:07:16,394
ranch.
Uh,

114
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:20,840
and there are a number of associated
brothels within that family,

115
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:21,800
but we won't get into that.

116
00:07:21,801 --> 00:07:24,620
This episode is in case you
haven't picked it up already.

117
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:28,850
Definitely not suitable for work,
people not suitable for work.

118
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,530
And s f w can imagine you'd be
listening to this on speakers at work,

119
00:07:33,531 --> 00:07:36,470
but just in case you have no common sense.
There you go.

120
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:40,340
And in this wide ranging conversation,
we cover quite a lot,

121
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,960
including technical sex tips,
how Alice puts people at ease,

122
00:07:44,961 --> 00:07:49,880
including adult versions. Uh, and
apologize, apologize, apologize.

123
00:07:49,881 --> 00:07:52,820
My apologies for the
crunching in the background.

124
00:07:52,821 --> 00:07:56,360
That is my dog Molly
chomping on a bully stick,

125
00:07:56,510 --> 00:08:01,130
otherwise known as bolt puzzle,
otherwise known as bull penis.

126
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:05,870
So maybe very appropriate
for this episode. Okay,

127
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:10,640
back on track focus Ferris.
Uh, we talk about BDSM.

128
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:13,070
If you don't know what that is,
we'll define it. And power play.

129
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:17,780
We talk about three some do's and
don'ts plus what she calls the Big Kao

130
00:08:17,781 --> 00:08:22,100
finishing move, uh, misconceptions
about sex workers and the realities,

131
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:27,380
why, what she calls the
girlfriend experience. Gfe
is her most popular offering,

132
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:30,770
how she works with couples who
want to explore new boundaries,

133
00:08:30,771 --> 00:08:33,830
new worlds and much more.

134
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:39,070
Alice is also a vocal advocate for
legal sex workers and the founder of the

135
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:43,820
political movement, hookers for
healthcare. A lot of back story there.

136
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:48,410
She's been featured on ABC's Nightline
and is no stranger to the conversation of

137
00:08:48,411 --> 00:08:53,411
what is called sex surrogacy that we
get into a little bit and seeks to shift

138
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:59,070
America's perceptions of sex workers
and sex work. So there you have it.

139
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:03,900
You can check her
out@thealislittle.com and elsewhere.

140
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,770
I hope you enjoyed this.
Very unusual but very,

141
00:09:07,771 --> 00:09:11,670
very practical conversation
as much as I did.

142
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,090
So without further ado,
here is Alice Little

143
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:19,900
Alice,
welcome to the show.

144
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:23,560
Hey, how are you? Thanks
so much for having me.

145
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:27,760
I am fantastic and I'm well caffeinated.

146
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:32,200
I've been looking forward to this
conversation all day and if wanted to have

147
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:37,710
this conversation or some form of it
for many years because I want to say 10

148
00:09:38,051 --> 00:09:42,040
years ago after reading the
alchemist by Paulo Coelho,

149
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:45,970
which has sold 100 million plus
copies around the world, oddly enough,

150
00:09:45,971 --> 00:09:49,630
he ended up appearing in my last book,
but that's a digression.

151
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:54,160
I was in an airport and I picked up
another book of his without really knowing

152
00:09:54,161 --> 00:09:56,980
anything about it and it was
called 11 minutes, which is very,

153
00:09:56,981 --> 00:10:01,981
very different from his other books and
it is a novel about the experiences of a

154
00:10:03,701 --> 00:10:07,420
young resilience sex worker and her
journey to self realization through sexual

155
00:10:07,421 --> 00:10:07,991
experience.

156
00:10:07,991 --> 00:10:11,770
And it takes her around the world to
Geneva and all these different locations

157
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:15,400
and describes her lessons.
And experiences and hardship,

158
00:10:15,401 --> 00:10:19,240
but also peak emotional
experiences and so on.

159
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,860
And I remember thinking to myself after
finishing that, what a unique life.

160
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:29,040
And at some point in my
life it'd be amazing to sit
down and have a conversation

161
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:34,090
with someone in that world. And here we
are. So thank you for making the time.

162
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:38,170
Absolutely. I'm really excited.
Looking forward to this,

163
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:39,090
we're going to have some fun.

164
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:44,450
And on the book point I was looking
through these bullets and I have so many

165
00:10:44,451 --> 00:10:45,231
questions for you,

166
00:10:45,231 --> 00:10:50,231
but one of the bullets was antiquarian
rare book collector and I thought we

167
00:10:50,331 --> 00:10:54,800
would just start there for no good
reason other than I'm curious.

168
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:58,250
Do you ha, how did you get
into that? First of all,

169
00:10:58,251 --> 00:11:01,670
and do you have any particular
favorites that come to mind?

170
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:07,410
Yes, I'm a rare book collecting.
Almost came naturally to me.

171
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:12,390
My family has had a lot of heirlooms and
antiques and a number of those include

172
00:11:12,391 --> 00:11:16,470
older familiar bibles. That just kind
of sparked my interest from a young age.

173
00:11:16,471 --> 00:11:21,471
And then as I've grown my interests of
diversified and I started looking into

174
00:11:21,841 --> 00:11:25,590
other types of publications that
existed within that time period,

175
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:29,400
I've always been attracted to things
like leather bound books and the,

176
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:34,640
the history of a book that is aged and
has had ownership that there might be

177
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:39,990
perhaps pencil marks in there or notes
from the person who first owned at kind

178
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:42,630
of putting their thumb print
on that piece of history.

179
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:45,960
And so I kind of think of those books
is not just a piece of historical

180
00:11:45,961 --> 00:11:46,531
literature,

181
00:11:46,531 --> 00:11:50,910
but also a piece of historical evidence
oftentimes as to how it relates to a

182
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,170
particular person.

183
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:56,380
Right. No, absolutely. That's
one of my favorite thing.

184
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,940
One of my favorite things about
used books is, is in, in some cases,

185
00:12:00,941 --> 00:12:05,590
looking at the highlights and
discovering what someone else thought was

186
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:09,040
important in those pages. And you
were, you mentioned your family,

187
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:11,110
you were born in Dublin,
is that correct?

188
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,940
Yes.
Just outside of Dublin proper.

189
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,970
All right. Which might partially at
least explain the natural red hair, uh,

190
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:24,020
for which love known among other
things and move to the u s uh,

191
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,700
as I understand it at around age five.

192
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And how did you ultimately
then find your way to sex work?

193
00:12:32,491 --> 00:12:37,491
Do you remember your first
exposure or how that came to be?

194
00:12:37,741 --> 00:12:41,270
I would love to know the story,
which I don't know and I had, uh,

195
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:45,060
both myself and someone else
trying to do background research.

196
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:49,950
And part of what made me even more excited
to have the conversation is there's

197
00:12:49,951 --> 00:12:53,340
not a whole lot. I mean there's a
little bit, but there's not much.

198
00:12:53,341 --> 00:12:56,520
So I feel like this is very fresh,
at least for me.

199
00:12:56,521 --> 00:13:00,420
So how did you find your way to sex work?
How did that happen?

200
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:05,330
Growing up, I had always been
a very naturally curious child.

201
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,100
I would be the kid that asks one too
many questions that had a little bit too

202
00:13:10,101 --> 00:13:15,101
much to say that always wanted to know
more whatever it was that I wasn't

203
00:13:15,651 --> 00:13:20,570
supposed to know at that age. That's what
I was most interested in. For example,

204
00:13:20,571 --> 00:13:24,980
I remember being a fourth
grader and trying to check
out the diary of Anne Frank

205
00:13:24,981 --> 00:13:28,700
and being told it was
grossly inappropriate and
going so far as to have my

206
00:13:28,701 --> 00:13:32,780
parents take it to the school board and
petition for me to be allowed to read

207
00:13:32,781 --> 00:13:33,860
this book.

208
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,240
So as far as being in,

209
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:41,900
I guess connection to my
body and my sexuality,

210
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:44,330
as I progressed through my years,

211
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,270
it came very naturally to me
to be sexually inquisitive.

212
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:50,870
I asked questions such as
why is the model of monogamy?

213
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,970
Why are we limiting
ourselves to man and wife?

214
00:13:56,210 --> 00:14:00,020
What about other options? What
other paradigms are there? What,

215
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:02,600
what more is there to
discover and learn from this?

216
00:14:02,601 --> 00:14:05,900
And that led me to discovering
the cat house series,

217
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:09,740
which featured the moonlight
bunny ranch on Hbo.

218
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,960
That aired for a number of years.

219
00:14:11,961 --> 00:14:16,460
It was incredibly impactful and it
really kind of was the first sexual

220
00:14:16,461 --> 00:14:20,420
renaissance, at least in modern
society that we have had.

221
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:25,900
I watched that show growing up and I just
admired the free sexual attitude that

222
00:14:28,131 --> 00:14:30,410
they had and the energy that they had.

223
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:36,080
Were there any particular episodes
or scenes or anything like that that,

224
00:14:36,201 --> 00:14:38,190
uh,
stuck in your mind in particular?

225
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,380
And where were you when you were
watching this? Where were you living?

226
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,291
Oh goodness.

227
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:46,970
I was actually living on long island
in New York at the time and it would be

228
00:14:46,971 --> 00:14:48,530
way,
way late at night.

229
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,040
I grew up in long island,
part of Long Island.

230
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:55,750
Oh my gosh. Are you serious?
I grew up in Nassau County.

231
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:57,870
Oh yeah, I was, I was
at Suffolk by myself,

232
00:14:57,871 --> 00:15:02,730
but I spent a lot of time in NASA as well.
Okay. All right. Strong island reunion.

233
00:15:02,731 --> 00:15:07,350
Unexpected. I like it. Uh, so
you're watching this series.

234
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:11,910
Are there any particular moments or scenes
or characters are really stuck out to

235
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:12,744
you?

236
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:13,781
Air Force.

237
00:15:13,781 --> 00:15:18,781
Amy was definitely one of the most
prominently featured women on the show and

238
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:24,001
she captured me everything from the way
that she carried herself to the language

239
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:28,810
she used when talking about her job
and the relationships that you had with

240
00:15:28,811 --> 00:15:29,644
clients.

241
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:34,770
And she was willing to show things that
many people oftentimes didn't consider,

242
00:15:35,621 --> 00:15:40,060
such as couples being at the
ranch or BDSM being an option.

243
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,160
She's even had an episode
specifically showing pony play before,

244
00:15:45,161 --> 00:15:49,300
which is when somebody is hooked up to
a cart and actually pull somebody around

245
00:15:49,301 --> 00:15:51,130
acting as if they are acumen pony.

246
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:56,400
I was going to ask, I wasn't sure
if, uh, what variety of pony play.

247
00:15:56,401 --> 00:15:57,250
We were talking

248
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:01,070
pretty fantastic stuff.

249
00:16:01,071 --> 00:16:06,071
I just really loved that free ability
to explore and innovate in this sexual

250
00:16:06,651 --> 00:16:09,410
way.
And it really spoke to me.

251
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:15,010
I was at the time a BDSM educator
and still am to this day.

252
00:16:15,171 --> 00:16:16,610
I travel around the country.

253
00:16:16,611 --> 00:16:21,611
I presented all sorts of different events
and panels and could you decide next

254
00:16:22,641 --> 00:16:23,140
step,

255
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,660
sorry to,
to interrupt a Q defined for people.

256
00:16:25,661 --> 00:16:29,560
And I think we'll probably stop a few
times in this conversation to do this. Uh,

257
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:33,520
BDSM, having lived in the
bay area, I've since moved,

258
00:16:33,521 --> 00:16:37,300
but in the bigger there for 17 years and
having taken tours of the armory and so

259
00:16:37,301 --> 00:16:41,410
on, I am familiar with BDSM
or what it is at least.

260
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:48,000
Oh yeah, it's a wild spot. Uh,
for those people wondering. Yeah,

261
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:49,270
you can look it up.
The armory,

262
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:54,070
they buy a 50 gallon drums of
lubrication, uh, at a time,

263
00:16:54,071 --> 00:16:56,140
which apparently you
can get on Amazon prime,

264
00:16:56,141 --> 00:17:00,280
which I can't imagine as a net gain for
Amazon, but I'm going off the rails.

265
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,900
So BDSM,
what is BDSM?

266
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:07,050
There are multiple different ways
to define BDSM, but simply put,

267
00:17:07,051 --> 00:17:10,650
it's an acronym that can stand
for several different things.

268
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:15,390
Anything from bondage, discipline, sadism,

269
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,670
Mac masochism too.

270
00:17:17,671 --> 00:17:21,840
Sometimes it's been used
to describe say bondage,

271
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:25,350
discipline,
dominance and submission.

272
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:30,330
So the exact wordage and the exact
verbiage changes depending on the circles.

273
00:17:30,331 --> 00:17:35,100
There's not 100% agreement as to which
letter has which particular meeting.

274
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:36,660
But generally speaking,

275
00:17:36,661 --> 00:17:40,650
it's divided up into BD
for bondage and discipline.

276
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:45,920
D S for dominance and submission
and s m for sadism and masochism.

277
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,800
What of all of those,

278
00:17:49,801 --> 00:17:54,510
what I think many of those are somewhat
self evident or people can envision what

279
00:17:54,511 --> 00:17:58,530
they mean. What is discipline?
What does that mean?

280
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:05,110
Discipline in the context of Bdsm is
the exchange of a physical or emotional

281
00:18:09,201 --> 00:18:11,120
control over someone.

282
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:16,390
Where you're either say spanking them
or perhaps going so far as to verbally

283
00:18:17,631 --> 00:18:20,750
chastise them if that's the
agreed upon that dynamic,

284
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:25,580
it's set up to kind of
recreate that structure.

285
00:18:25,581 --> 00:18:29,540
Often found within the military where
there's this chain of command in this

286
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:34,220
understanding of who reports to
hill within the BDSM culture.

287
00:18:34,221 --> 00:18:39,221
Sometimes that discipline will enter
into a submissive dominant relationship

288
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:44,050
where that's used in combination
with their relationship.

289
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,530
And, uh, it makes me think of it, I don't
think this quote applies everywhere,

290
00:18:48,531 --> 00:18:50,180
but I want to say may west,

291
00:18:50,181 --> 00:18:54,590
but Mae West is kind of like the
female version of a Mark Twain.

292
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,330
You can kind of attribute
any quote to her.

293
00:18:56,331 --> 00:18:59,750
So I may be getting the attribution wrong,
but the quote was,

294
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:04,940
I don't think she'd mind either. The, the
quote was something along the lines of,

295
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:09,590
uh, everything in life is about sex
except for sex. Sex is about power.

296
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:12,560
And, uh, that the, at
least in the BDSM world,

297
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:15,080
I imagine that would
have some application,

298
00:19:15,081 --> 00:19:18,170
but the BDSM then it sounds
like based on what you said,

299
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:23,740
your fascination with that or
even teaching that predated your,

300
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:26,090
uh, work as a sex worker. Is that right?

301
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:27,561
Yes.

302
00:19:27,561 --> 00:19:32,561
I celebrated my 18th birthday by going
into a dungeon space in New York City for

303
00:19:34,191 --> 00:19:38,480
the first time and finally getting to
interact with this community that I had

304
00:19:38,481 --> 00:19:40,460
been waiting to for a number of years.

305
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:45,140
My interest in BDSM started
very organically in high school.

306
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:50,410
Things like tying up my first girlfriend
with rope and kind of enjoying that and

307
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:53,930
it led me to discover the BDSM community.

308
00:19:53,931 --> 00:19:57,830
And from there I was just chomping at
the bit to get that education and that

309
00:19:57,831 --> 00:19:58,664
knowledge.

310
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:01,430
And when did the then,
when did the uh,

311
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:05,110
or how really did the sex
work enter the picture?

312
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:11,750
There's a very fine line between BDSM
and sex work in the sense that both are

313
00:20:11,751 --> 00:20:14,380
very sexually charged activities.
It's,

314
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:18,710
it was very comfortable and easy almost
for me to make the jump from one to the

315
00:20:18,711 --> 00:20:19,430
other.

316
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:24,410
It was a very conscious decision where
I sat down one day and said to myself,

317
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,980
where do I see myself
going within the next year?

318
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:32,630
Where do I see myself going? The year
after that? What about five years?

319
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,360
And when I really sat
and thought about it,

320
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:40,610
I saw myself entering a profession that
allowed me to connect with people on a

321
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:45,230
intimate level more so than what
society generally allows for.

322
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:50,380
In the past, I've worked
as a massage therapist do I
got to develop that hands on

323
00:20:50,381 --> 00:20:52,150
relationship with the clientele,

324
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:57,490
but it kind of just fell short of that
deep personal intimacy that I was looking

325
00:20:57,491 --> 00:21:01,630
forward to. I've always felt
that life is about enrichment,

326
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:05,680
both for our own betterment as well
as the betterment of those around us.

327
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:10,060
And for me, sex work ended up being
the perfect channel to do that.

328
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:14,300
You've done a number of other things.
You mentioned massage therapist,

329
00:21:14,301 --> 00:21:17,870
and please correct me if I'm wrong
because of course you should.

330
00:21:17,871 --> 00:21:20,540
Everyone should be cautious
about believing everything
they read on the Internet.

331
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,590
But I, uh, emergency medical technician,

332
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:29,390
jockey at race tracks.
Those are other things that you tried,

333
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,373
correct?

334
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:31,600
Oh yes.

335
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:36,600
I have tried a little bit of everything
under the sun trying to find something

336
00:21:37,001 --> 00:21:39,220
that just felt right.

337
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:44,430
I wanted to find a job where not only
did I feel comfortable with what I was

338
00:21:44,741 --> 00:21:49,420
doing, but I also felt a more meaningful
calling than it just being a job.

339
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:52,330
But it actually had a
deeper purpose to it.

340
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:56,500
That kind of relates back to the book
you mentioned 11 minutes where she goes

341
00:21:56,501 --> 00:22:01,501
through the sexual journey and kind of
finds herself it various true for many of

342
00:22:01,751 --> 00:22:02,680
us sex workers,

343
00:22:02,681 --> 00:22:07,681
that message of self discovery and sexual
freedom and that ability to explore

344
00:22:08,861 --> 00:22:13,690
those parts of ourselves and share them
with what are formally strangers is

345
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,393
incredible.

346
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,980
What was your first,

347
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:22,590
or what you would consider your
first Gig? I suppose I'm, I,

348
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,700
I'm going to stumble a
little bit because I'm not,

349
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,380
I'm not sure which labels or words to
use. So if I offend, please forgive.

350
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:33,100
But what was your first, I guess,
client engagement as a sex worker?

351
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:37,300
Do you remember your first experience and
could you describe it for us or one of

352
00:22:37,301 --> 00:22:38,134
the first,

353
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,790
I remember it very,
very crystal clear.

354
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:47,300
The bunny ranch maintains a set of
forums online which allows for a greater

355
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:53,550
depth of communication and intimacy
before we even meet face to face.

356
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:56,970
It allows,
the lady is like myself to post photos,

357
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:01,080
different interests kind of share about
us on that humanistic level rather than

358
00:23:01,081 --> 00:23:03,780
just that appearance level.

359
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:09,180
I had posted about a particular interest
I had in one of these specialty rooms

360
00:23:09,181 --> 00:23:11,550
at the ranch. I had simply said, hey,

361
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,920
I'm something I'm really
looking forward to trying.

362
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,310
I'd love somebody to come out
and spend that time with me.

363
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:22,470
And within the week I had an email
and it was my first appointment.

364
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:23,760
The gentleman called,
yeah,

365
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:26,440
I'm sorry, what was the room?
Maybe we'll get to it, but

366
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:29,050
oh it is.

367
00:23:29,051 --> 00:23:34,051
This set up where it's an indoor Jacuzzi
with an attached suites next to it.

368
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:38,530
This way you can come and go between the
Jacuzzi and the bed as comfortably as

369
00:23:38,531 --> 00:23:39,364
you,
so please.

370
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:42,090
Got It. Okay. Please
continue. Sorry. So you,

371
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:45,590
so you received an email from a client?

372
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:51,160
Yeah. And they're like, I love this
idea. You have, I'm interested.

373
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:52,300
Let's do it.

374
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:56,230
So of course I have all the nerves
and anxiety that comes with the first

375
00:23:56,231 --> 00:24:01,231
appointment in a new industry and
everything ended up going as smooth as

376
00:24:02,831 --> 00:24:03,521
clockwork.

377
00:24:03,521 --> 00:24:08,521
It was just so much simpler
than my mind made it out to be.

378
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:13,720
I tend to overthink
and overanalyze things.

379
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:18,520
And so I naturally always prepare
for the worst. In any scenario,

380
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:22,300
what happens if I make a mistake?
What if we don't connect?

381
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:25,150
What if something happens
in the Jacuzzi brakes?

382
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:30,360
I tried to always plan for such
contingencies and at the end of the day,

383
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:34,930
the reality was, is the intimacy
just very natural and comfortable.

384
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:39,460
And to this day that client is still
one of my regulars that I get to see and

385
00:24:39,461 --> 00:24:41,230
connect with fairly often.

386
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:43,830
All right.
So you mentioned you were nervous,

387
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:47,340
highly analytical by nature and
then it went like clockwork.

388
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:51,750
What is the format of one
of those first encounters?

389
00:24:51,751 --> 00:24:55,200
And what I mean by that is I've read uh,

390
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:58,710
that and I actually don't
know where this term comes in,

391
00:24:58,711 --> 00:25:01,290
but I've read about negotiations.

392
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:06,291
So it seems like you get paired with a
big sister and then there's a sit down

393
00:25:06,331 --> 00:25:09,240
with the client. Is there a
negotiation today? Did I misread that?

394
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:13,230
And what role does the big sister
play or the more experienced woman?

395
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:15,830
Well to start with,

396
00:25:15,831 --> 00:25:19,160
I'd Kinda like to describe what it's
like when you come into the ranch cause

397
00:25:19,161 --> 00:25:23,580
that kind of helps set the stage for
what inexperienced there is. Like. Sure.

398
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:28,660
Either either somebody would set an
appointment with a particular lady or they

399
00:25:29,061 --> 00:25:32,690
would come in and request a lineup.
If you choose to request a lineup,

400
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,710
all of the available ladies will come
out to the parlor. We stand in the line,

401
00:25:36,711 --> 00:25:39,890
introduce ourselves and
after we introduce ourselves,

402
00:25:39,891 --> 00:25:42,290
you're free to walk up to
the lady of your choice,

403
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:45,440
take her by the hand and go
for a tour of the property.

404
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:48,770
The bunny ranch is an
incredibly historic property.

405
00:25:48,771 --> 00:25:53,771
It's been there since the 1950s it's
beautiful and has been many times

406
00:25:55,371 --> 00:25:57,860
remodeled,
revamped and renovated,

407
00:25:57,861 --> 00:26:01,070
so it really is a top of
the line gorgeous facility,

408
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,310
so we like to kind of showcase that
in addition to some of the different

409
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,750
specialty rooms,

410
00:26:05,751 --> 00:26:09,680
suites and offerings that we
happen to have at the ranch.

411
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,350
After the tour,
the guest in the lady,

412
00:26:12,351 --> 00:26:16,430
then go back to that ladies room
where they will then set and have a

413
00:26:16,431 --> 00:26:17,570
negotiation.

414
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:22,580
If the lady is Neil for the first couple
of times they'll introduce the big

415
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:25,640
sister or a mentor who's an older,

416
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:29,630
more experienced lady that's been there
for a little bit to kind of help you

417
00:26:29,631 --> 00:26:33,800
through those first couple of times until
you start to feel comfortable and more

418
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:38,750
confident during the negotiation. That's
where we kind of have a conversation.

419
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:44,250
I hate to use the word negotiation
because it feels very business.

420
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,520
I like to think of it more like
having a conversation with a friend.

421
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,280
It's something that
happens very organically.

422
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:54,540
It gives me the opportunity to get to
know who you are on that personal level

423
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:57,480
and also kind of let you know
a little bit about myself.

424
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:02,130
When it comes to intimacy and attraction,

425
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:06,450
it's so much more than just that
skin level. It certainly goes deeper,

426
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:11,040
so I really like to take that time during
that first few moments to really get

427
00:27:11,041 --> 00:27:15,210
to know who somebody is as a
person beyond their at a brothel.

428
00:27:15,211 --> 00:27:19,950
They're interested in services I like
to take a little bit longer than most in

429
00:27:19,951 --> 00:27:21,210
that particular regard.

430
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:26,010
During the negotiation we'll also talk
about what particular activities we're

431
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:27,330
interested in,

432
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:31,170
what sorts of fantasies they may have,

433
00:27:31,171 --> 00:27:33,930
what sort of special requests
that they would have,

434
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:37,940
and from there we kind of formulate what
our time together is going to look into

435
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:41,070
feel like. How long would it
be like to spend together?

436
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,040
Would we like to stay in my room or are
we interested in one of those specialty

437
00:27:45,041 --> 00:27:46,620
sweets I mentioned earlier?

438
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:51,120
Is there a particular activity that they
want to try or is there a second lady

439
00:27:51,121 --> 00:27:53,100
they would like to
involve in the encounter?

440
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:57,390
That's kind of where we get to shape
and figure out what we're going to do.

441
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,260
And after that point you
would then go to the office.

442
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:04,770
They handle all the financial
transactions very discreetly.

443
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:09,120
The ladies don't actually have any
interaction with the client's personal

444
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:13,170
information for their protection.
All of that is handled by the cashier.

445
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:16,200
We then get a set of sheets,
couple towels,

446
00:28:16,201 --> 00:28:20,550
perhaps a bottle of champagne for fun and
head back to my room where the Sweden.

447
00:28:20,551 --> 00:28:22,480
We're all fun and adventure.
Yeah.

448
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:27,940
So I want to dig into a
few followup questions.

449
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:32,680
Um, so you sit down and
I think in my mind, uh,

450
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:34,640
I'm,
I'm envisioning,

451
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:38,300
I've only seen the first
installment of the film,

452
00:28:38,301 --> 00:28:42,230
50 shades of gray where they're having
this conversation about what are the,

453
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:46,790
the go no go rules. Uh,
I suppose which, uh,

454
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:50,840
among my friends who do BDSM of
course is very, or it's on some level,

455
00:28:50,841 --> 00:28:53,840
seems very familiar. Uh, what are the,

456
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:57,980
what are some of the questions that
you'd like to ask or the most important

457
00:28:57,981 --> 00:28:59,630
questions that you ask?

458
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:06,230
I tend to work with a very wide variety
of people and more often than not I work

459
00:29:06,231 --> 00:29:10,220
with people that I've had the opportunity
to communicate with via email.

460
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:14,000
That's given me the opportunity to tech
to kind of get to know them and their

461
00:29:14,001 --> 00:29:15,500
personality a little bit.

462
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:19,880
So I'm able to better adjust the
types of questions I ask. For example,

463
00:29:19,881 --> 00:29:24,320
if I have a couple that is never had
a third person involved in any sort of

464
00:29:24,321 --> 00:29:25,400
sexual encounter,

465
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:29,600
the very first thing I'm going to
ask is what are you comfortable with?

466
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:31,480
What are you not comfortable with?

467
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:34,700
And allow them to start setting
their own particular boundaries.

468
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:37,880
Cause with a couple of you certainly
don't want to violate any sort of

469
00:29:37,881 --> 00:29:41,860
preexisting communication
agreements that have made.

470
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:47,130
And so I like to make pay on honor
almost to their relationship and kind of

471
00:29:47,141 --> 00:29:51,280
allow them to dictate in a way to me
where are they see me fitting into the

472
00:29:51,281 --> 00:29:56,080
puzzle of their preexisting
connection versus

473
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:59,820
what if, sorry, not to interrupt,
but I'll probably interrupt a lot. So

474
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:05,820
let's see.
A couple comes to you and as you noted,

475
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:08,010
perhaps they've never had this experience.

476
00:30:08,011 --> 00:30:13,011
And so you ask them what they're
comfortable with and they're not sure,

477
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:18,300
and they ask you, what would you suggest
as guidelines or how should we do this?

478
00:30:18,301 --> 00:30:19,410
We've never done this before,

479
00:30:19,411 --> 00:30:22,170
we're not sure what would make
us comfortable or uncomfortable.

480
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:26,340
What types of guidelines might
you offer them or suggestions?

481
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:32,630
The very first thing that I like to start
with is a very simple and really fun

482
00:30:32,631 --> 00:30:35,270
getting to know you. Exercise, of course,

483
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,670
dig into a little bit
more of an adult level.

484
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:40,610
I find that here,

485
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:43,680
and this is an adult show so we can
get into the details. It's okay.

486
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,100
Oh, fantastic. Here we go.

487
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:50,060
Yeah. For those parents in the
car with their kids right now,

488
00:30:50,061 --> 00:30:54,470
I'd recommend earmuffs or having a
pause break for birds and the bees

489
00:30:54,471 --> 00:30:57,260
conversation and we're back.
So please continue. Yep. So,

490
00:30:57,290 --> 00:31:00,860
so people are looking for suggestions
from you as a couple. What do you do?

491
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:02,150
And you mentioned an exercise.

492
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:07,220
Yes. The very first thing I like to
start with is a foreplay exercise.

493
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,760
Women take significantly longer
to become aroused, but then men,

494
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:14,780
that's a biological fact and
oftentimes in sexual encounters,

495
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:19,220
there's not enough of that warmup period,
especially during the get to know you,

496
00:31:19,221 --> 00:31:20,840
that first encounter with somebody.

497
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:26,080
That time needs to be even
more so explored and even
more so embraced and so I

498
00:31:26,481 --> 00:31:28,790
like to simply start by the two of us,

499
00:31:28,791 --> 00:31:33,791
either myself and the wife or myself
and the husband undressing one of the

500
00:31:34,401 --> 00:31:39,020
partners very, very slowly and essentially
while they have their eyes closed.

501
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:42,380
This does a couple of different things.
First,

502
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:45,680
when you close your eyes during
any sort of intimate encounter,

503
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:48,230
it's going tighten all
of your other senses.

504
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,750
Your sense of smell becomes
significantly sharper,

505
00:31:50,751 --> 00:31:54,350
where you're able to smell a hint of
perfume, where that width of Cologne,

506
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:58,190
when you close your eyes, you feel
every single touch of the fingertip,

507
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:02,900
the pressure of the nail sliding over
your backer, over your partner's nipples.

508
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:07,900
It's incredibly arousing and just that
one simple thing adds a certain depth and

509
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:14,500
really lets you sink into what's happening
and appreciate every single movement.

510
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:18,380
I kind of like to think of sex as a dance.

511
00:32:18,381 --> 00:32:21,950
In a way it's working with
a partner or partners.

512
00:32:21,951 --> 00:32:25,130
You're coordinating your
movements and your energy,

513
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:29,810
you're breathing oftentimes will become
subconsciously synchronized and just

514
00:32:29,811 --> 00:32:34,340
naturally fall into this flow where
you're exploring, kissing, touching,

515
00:32:34,341 --> 00:32:39,341
and just embracing and letting things
really naturally go with the flow and your

516
00:32:39,801 --> 00:32:44,801
mind kind of takeover instinctually
rather than pre programming and deciding,

517
00:32:45,351 --> 00:32:49,550
first I shall remove the top,
then I shall slowly remove this broad,

518
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:54,140
but with my teeth that that removes
all the sexual spontaneity out of it.

519
00:32:54,141 --> 00:32:56,930
There has to be that certain
organic element to it.

520
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:01,530
Otherwise you're looking at a porn,
not a true encounter.

521
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:07,330
Okay, so you get, so you get to, you
slowly address one of the partners.

522
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:09,670
Then then what happens?

523
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:15,430
Then we go to each of the other two and
turn either myself or the husband first,

524
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:18,460
whichever things just
happened to come naturally.

525
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:21,020
Same process repeated over again.

526
00:33:21,021 --> 00:33:25,720
And at this point I'm going to start
encouraging them to not just explore each

527
00:33:25,721 --> 00:33:28,630
other and spotless,
but also explore their body.

528
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:31,510
Or I also explore my body as well.

529
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:36,720
So I might take his hand and kiss his
fingertips and literally holding his hand,

530
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:40,320
trace it down my neck and
price it onto my breasts.

531
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:44,320
This way he feels comfortable and
that touch barrier has been breached.

532
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:45,910
Once that's happened,

533
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:50,230
I've had found that naturally people
settle in a little bit more and they start

534
00:33:50,231 --> 00:33:54,580
to give themselves permission to
enjoy that encounter. And Really, oh,

535
00:33:54,581 --> 00:33:58,090
that's really happening now.
Oh, I can do these things.

536
00:33:58,091 --> 00:34:02,170
I do have the power of the sexual
expression and freedom here.

537
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,940
So in that circumstance,

538
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:09,330
when you look over your
experiences with couples,

539
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,730
what this,
this is going to sent might sound funny,

540
00:34:14,731 --> 00:34:18,600
but what are the smarter guys do and
what do the not so smart guys do?

541
00:34:18,601 --> 00:34:23,601
And the reason I ask is I
recall a conversation I had
with a dear friend of mine

542
00:34:24,241 --> 00:34:29,100
who for a period of time, he's
happily married with kids now and has,

543
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:33,090
has voluntarily chosen a monogamy.
But uh,

544
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:37,680
back in his sort of peak
athletic, uh, years,

545
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:42,740
he was a master of threesomes and I mean
really just seemed to have near magical

546
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:47,000
powers. And he said, he said
to me at one point, he, he,

547
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,550
he observed that if you have,

548
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:55,350
if you want to have threesomes with
say, a girlfriend or a wife, he said,

549
00:34:55,351 --> 00:35:00,351
rule number one is you do not penetrate
the other woman on the first date.

550
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:04,470
And he said, if you do that, you can
have many, many, many threesomes.

551
00:35:04,471 --> 00:35:06,720
But if you penetrate the other woman,

552
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:09,480
I e not your girlfriend
on that first encounter,

553
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:14,840
you could completely shut her down in
meaning your girlfriend and then you've

554
00:35:14,881 --> 00:35:15,480
just,

555
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:20,480
you've just ruined your opportunity to
have an ongoing enjoyable experiences as

556
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:25,020
a, as a couple. So I don't know if that's
true. It sounds like it's plausible,

557
00:35:25,021 --> 00:35:28,800
but are there certain things
that smart guys do versus not?

558
00:35:28,801 --> 00:35:33,300
So smart guys are experienced
guys in that type of circumstance.

559
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:37,150
So the smart guys communicate,
they're very,

560
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:40,410
with their significant other
as to what their desire is,

561
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,640
what kinds of fantasies they want to
see and what kind of an experience they

562
00:35:44,641 --> 00:35:45,540
want to have.

563
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:50,730
They also have to be willing to wait
until their partner is comfortable and

564
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:54,390
ready to have that experience.
Trying to manipulate your partner,

565
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:59,100
intuit sexual encounter is the
absolute worst thing that you could do.

566
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:04,080
And that is typically the first thing
that I see couples do when they're doing

567
00:36:04,081 --> 00:36:09,060
it the wrong way. If the guy is doing it
for very selfish reasons where you know,

568
00:36:09,061 --> 00:36:12,960
he doesn't really care of his wife's
into it, this is all about him,

569
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,820
those guys,

570
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:19,050
they're not being respectful of the
woman's right over her own body,

571
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:23,580
let alone their agreed upon relationship.
So I would say that the very,

572
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:27,390
very first thing is communication
followed by consent.

573
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:33,880
Well, how do you help to break
the ice? If, let's say you,

574
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,770
you've removed the clothing,
you've traced someone's hand,

575
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,520
maybe both the, let's just assume
for the time being man and a woman.

576
00:36:42,521 --> 00:36:47,400
So both of their hands
on your bodies, uh, if,

577
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:51,280
if they're still not sure what to do,
what,

578
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:54,850
what is a good next move?
If you're directing things,

579
00:36:56,130 --> 00:37:00,990
if I'm kind of playing ringleader as it
was and we're still reaching this point

580
00:37:00,991 --> 00:37:04,530
where we're a little bit tentative and
that intimacy hasn't quite clicked into

581
00:37:04,531 --> 00:37:08,000
place, the next thing we'll
often go ahead is move onto,

582
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:11,160
but it's called an edible body massage.

583
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:16,520
This is where you use body safe products
that also are either flavored incented,

584
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:20,790
for example, um, uh, honey massage lotion,

585
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:25,740
and then we'll go ahead and lay one or
both of the partners down and slowly use

586
00:37:25,741 --> 00:37:29,970
that and warm them up that way.
Again, keeping with that Taj,

587
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,000
keeping with that sensory input and
really allowing everyone to participate.

588
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:39,720
This isn't a scenario where one partner
is on the other side of the bed.

589
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:44,310
This is the scenario where both myself
and the wife may be massaging the husband

590
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:49,400
or they must be massaging
me either which way.

591
00:37:49,561 --> 00:37:54,480
It just allows for that continuation and
natural flow of energy and chemistry.

592
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,670
Hmm.
What are other things that,

593
00:37:56,780 --> 00:38:01,780
that you do in those circumstances
to make the woman comfortable?

594
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:07,580
Are there any other particular tricks
of the trade or phrases or questions or

595
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,580
guidelines that that you use?

596
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:15,730
This is going to be an interesting one,
but since this is an adult show, yeah.

597
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:19,200
One of the things I liked to do to help
make it the woman relax a little bit

598
00:38:19,201 --> 00:38:21,420
more as I like to make her have an orgasm.

599
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:26,720
This can either be through
digital stimulation with my
fingers or perhaps with a

600
00:38:28,231 --> 00:38:29,280
sex toy.

601
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:33,090
Perhaps with the assistance of her partner
playing with her nipples are kissing

602
00:38:33,091 --> 00:38:33,924
her,

603
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:38,890
allowing the to go ahead and have
that first orgasm in that threesome,

604
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:44,370
it makes her feel secure that she's
not going to be a less than partner.

605
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:51,010
Many women have this concern about this
comparison between themselves and the

606
00:38:51,011 --> 00:38:51,844
other women.

607
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:56,200
I think it's one of the reasons why I
have so many couples is because being a

608
00:38:56,201 --> 00:38:58,060
forefoot eight petite redhead,

609
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:02,760
there's not a lot of women who can look
at themselves and feel compared to me,

610
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,420
the body type,
the height.

611
00:39:04,421 --> 00:39:08,890
It's such a complete night
and day difference that they
feel comfortable sharing

612
00:39:08,891 --> 00:39:12,340
their significant other with me because
they don't see me as a threat to their

613
00:39:12,341 --> 00:39:16,990
relationship. And then when we go ahead
and give that woman the first orgasm,

614
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:21,220
it's solidifying her place within
that sexual dynamics saying yes,

615
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,870
your feelings,

616
00:39:22,871 --> 00:39:27,871
your sexual experience is absolutely
important and it's going to be a part of

617
00:39:29,051 --> 00:39:32,200
this. Women are lucky we
get to come more than once.

618
00:39:32,201 --> 00:39:34,810
And so why not start
things off with a bang?

619
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,640
Why not indeed.
Uh,

620
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:43,510
what are some of your best practices
for helping a woman to orgasm?

621
00:39:43,971 --> 00:39:45,500
Do you have any favorite sex toys?

622
00:39:45,501 --> 00:39:50,501
Do you have any of many women
have difficulty orgasming or May,

623
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:55,400
may, may be coming into an
experience, perhaps not, uh,

624
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,330
with your clients, I don't
know, but in orgasmic, right,

625
00:39:59,331 --> 00:40:02,060
they haven't experienced
that before. Uh, what are,

626
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:06,590
what are some of the approaches or,
or sort of technical tips or,

627
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:11,680
or toys that you use that you've
found to be particularly helpful?

628
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:14,103
Sure thing.

629
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:18,820
I happen to work with both couples as
well as single women many times over this

630
00:40:18,821 --> 00:40:22,180
particular problem.
And believe it or not,

631
00:40:22,181 --> 00:40:26,470
it's a societaly endemic problem where
the majority of women have trouble

632
00:40:26,471 --> 00:40:30,640
reaching climax either single
by themselves or with a partner.

633
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:34,870
So I think talking about something like
this was really important personally.

634
00:40:34,871 --> 00:40:39,010
I always love to suggest the simplest toy,

635
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:43,180
which is a wall plug
in Hitachi magic wand,

636
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,690
great device.

637
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:47,970
It is the best.

638
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:51,270
And as far as sex safety
goes between partners,

639
00:40:51,271 --> 00:40:54,870
always make sure you're putting a condom
over the top of the Hitachi because we

640
00:40:54,871 --> 00:40:58,950
want to play safe with our toys. So when
we're going ahead and using the Hitachi,

641
00:40:58,951 --> 00:41:03,000
that is absolutely fantastic
for direct clitoral stimulation.

642
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:07,260
You can go ahead and an increase or
decrease the intensity by pushing down

643
00:41:07,261 --> 00:41:11,880
harder or softer and if that
still isn't quite doing it.

644
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:17,060
The second thing I like to do is a
simple one or two finger insertion.

645
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,350
Nothing too much more than that,

646
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:22,890
especially on the first orgasm
cause that's kind of a a warmup.

647
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:27,220
We're like diesel engines.
It takes us a moment to get warmed up,

648
00:41:27,221 --> 00:41:30,720
but once we're there we're going
to stay pairing for a while.

649
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:35,540
And so you're doing the one or two finger
insertion along with the Hitachi magic

650
00:41:35,541 --> 00:41:36,374
wand.

651
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:41,730
Yup. Just same slow,
repetitive motion in and out.

652
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:45,960
And the whole thing that a lot of guys
make the mistake on when trying to help

653
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:49,740
their partner climax is variation.
In my experience,

654
00:41:49,741 --> 00:41:54,360
most women actually prefer a more
rhythmic approach into at a simple one,

655
00:41:54,361 --> 00:41:56,340
two,
one two in,

656
00:41:56,370 --> 00:42:01,370
out in out tends to work a lot better
than one to one to Bonn too in out,

657
00:42:04,261 --> 00:42:09,180
in out like God, it's very difficult
for a woman to achieve climax that way.

658
00:42:09,181 --> 00:42:12,240
And that's just a biological
difference between men and women.

659
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:16,290
I've noticed that men tend to like
variation when pleasuring themselves are

660
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:19,980
receiving a hand job for a woman.
They liked the difference in strokes,

661
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:24,720
length and pressure, whereas when they
were pretty consistent about what we like,

662
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:28,320
we like to do what we
do and stick with that.

663
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:33,410
So it's okay if you're doing the same
thing over and over again if fits working.

664
00:42:33,511 --> 00:42:35,430
Trust me y'all now.

665
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,860
So a couple of a couple of notes on
the Hitachi Magic Wand for people. Uh,

666
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:43,800
a as you can certainly find
it at just about any sex shop,

667
00:42:43,801 --> 00:42:46,470
you can certainly buy it also online,
Amazon,

668
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:49,290
etc. End It can serve double duty.

669
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:54,330
For those of you who might've
read tools of titans for relaxing,

670
00:42:54,930 --> 00:42:59,490
uh,
hyper tonic or spasmed muscles.

671
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:03,420
So for instance, in the forearms,
in the forearm flexors and so on,

672
00:43:03,421 --> 00:43:07,530
if you've really tight
forearms, a gymnast's, in fact,

673
00:43:07,531 --> 00:43:10,600
former national team, men's coach, uh,

674
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:15,120
coach Summer Som Mer recommended the
Hitachi magic wand, but not for sex,

675
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:20,580
for relieving muscle tightness. So
if you need that excuse, uh, guys,

676
00:43:20,581 --> 00:43:23,610
you can grab one of those and then your
girlfriend will steal it from you. Um,

677
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:28,560
but that, that's, that's one. Do you use
the high or the low setting? Most often?

678
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:33,060
I'm kind of a low setting girl.
I kind of just prefer that,

679
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:35,670
that lower intensity level and I kind of,

680
00:43:35,671 --> 00:43:39,810
we'll save that higher mode for
more of the very end of the session.

681
00:43:39,811 --> 00:43:42,180
If you really want to ramp things up and,

682
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:47,190
well I guess the best way to describe
it is that the Hitachi has two settings

683
00:43:47,310 --> 00:43:50,310
strong and crawling up the walls strong

684
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,520
and uh, how long is, let's just say
in the case of the couple like uh,

685
00:43:56,890 --> 00:44:01,570
uh,
a minimum or an ideal length of session,

686
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:02,920
how much time do you have?

687
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:08,330
It completely varies from couple
to couple. Generally speaking,

688
00:44:08,331 --> 00:44:10,040
for somebody first encounter,

689
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:13,780
I like to go ahead and include
something called an outdate.

690
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:15,360
What an outdate is,

691
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:19,760
is that it actually allows us to leave
the brothel and then travel anywhere we

692
00:44:19,761 --> 00:44:23,720
would like in Nevada.
So perhaps we all go out for lunch first.

693
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:25,970
This way we get to have some conversation,

694
00:44:25,971 --> 00:44:29,450
get to have a little bit of that
mental stimulating for a play,

695
00:44:29,451 --> 00:44:32,040
not just the physical
stimulating for play.

696
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:36,450
Then after lunch we'll head back to the
branch and from there go ahead and kind

697
00:44:36,451 --> 00:44:40,470
of enjoy our sexual festivities.
Couples that are on say,

698
00:44:40,471 --> 00:44:45,471
a traveling time schedule where
they only have a couple of hours.

699
00:44:45,870 --> 00:44:50,870
It's absolutely okay to spend just two
hours with some day or even just a single

700
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:54,150
hour with someone,
but generally speaking for couples,

701
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:59,310
I recommend going ahead and investing
in a slightly more elaborate experience,

702
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:04,020
especially for their first time because
that attitude and that energy is going

703
00:45:04,021 --> 00:45:08,760
to make a huge difference in regards to
what you experience here at the ranch.

704
00:45:08,761 --> 00:45:09,594
With me,

705
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:13,410
that little bit of extra connection time
of just going and having a simple meal

706
00:45:13,411 --> 00:45:17,760
with someone, it gives all the
stress and moment to leave your body.

707
00:45:17,761 --> 00:45:21,570
It allows all of your
anxiety to kind of go,

708
00:45:21,571 --> 00:45:25,380
we'll buy in dissipate and by the
time we make it back to the bedroom,

709
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:29,670
you've already relaxed the butterflies
to have calmed down and you feel a little

710
00:45:29,671 --> 00:45:32,580
bit more comfortable with
where things are going next.

711
00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:38,300
What? What are some of the
most requested activities?

712
00:45:38,301 --> 00:45:42,530
You mentioned activities a few times what
or what or if you were looking at the

713
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:46,220
pie chart of requests
that you've received,

714
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:51,050
what are the most often
requested activities?

715
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:55,560
I would say that there are two different
things that would kind of fall into

716
00:45:55,561 --> 00:45:56,341
that pie chart.

717
00:45:56,341 --> 00:46:00,810
It would probably be more accurate to go
ahead and label it as both experiences

718
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:05,430
and specific activity requests and
sometimes those things go hand in hand or

719
00:46:05,431 --> 00:46:06,510
they go separately.

720
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:10,920
Probably my most requested experience
is something called the girlfriend

721
00:46:10,921 --> 00:46:11,754
experience.

722
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,980
It's where we take things to that next
level of intimacy and I oftentimes it's

723
00:46:16,981 --> 00:46:21,240
argued it could even border on sexual
surrogacy where you're taking things that

724
00:46:21,241 --> 00:46:25,650
next step further. That's where
we're going out to eat together.

725
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,140
We may choose to go to a concert together.

726
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:32,100
We're going to keep in touch
and communication between
our time together via

727
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:34,860
text or email or perhaps phone calls.

728
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:39,300
It allows for that depth and that
building of relationship that really

729
00:46:39,301 --> 00:46:43,530
transcends beyond just a single
standalone session. Absolutely.

730
00:46:43,531 --> 00:46:47,910
The majority of my couples and the
majority of my clients in general tend to

731
00:46:47,911 --> 00:46:51,000
fall into that more girlfriend
experience category.

732
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:56,450
The second most requested experience
is kink or BDSM and fetish activities.

733
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:01,260
This may be in the example of a couple,

734
00:47:01,530 --> 00:47:06,450
a couple that is interested in bondage
and discipline where I might teach the

735
00:47:06,451 --> 00:47:11,451
husband the safe way to use rope to tie
up his wife and then explore how to use

736
00:47:12,301 --> 00:47:15,780
floggers and sex toys to
give her that sexual release.

737
00:47:15,990 --> 00:47:18,870
Whereas say with a single male,

738
00:47:18,871 --> 00:47:23,871
he may be interested in having me dominate
him instead and he wants to explore

739
00:47:23,881 --> 00:47:26,250
his submissive side and
his submissive energy.

740
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:30,430
So I'd say that would probably be the
most second requested category I have.

741
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:34,510
And the third would probably
be two girl in counters.

742
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:38,620
Having a threesome is on almost
every single guys bucket lesson.

743
00:47:38,621 --> 00:47:41,860
There's no better place in the world
then the bunny ranch ticket to have that

744
00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:45,430
encounter. We're professionals. I mean
we'll take care of you the right way.

745
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:50,740
All right, so these, those
sound like the experiences,

746
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:53,790
if we were getting into specifics,
are there any

747
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:57,100
as in more so the specific
sex acts that ourselves

748
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,050
yeah. With, within any of those buckets.

749
00:48:00,590 --> 00:48:03,830
I'm just so curious to, to know, uh,

750
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:08,480
because I remember having a conversation
living in San Francisco for a long time,

751
00:48:08,481 --> 00:48:12,990
getting to know people who are very sex
positive and support sex workers in,

752
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:16,850
and one of them said,
for instance, that, uh,

753
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:19,820
they found,
uh,

754
00:48:20,310 --> 00:48:22,460
like oral sex blow jobs to be very,

755
00:48:22,461 --> 00:48:27,461
very commonly requested because a lot of
men are not given that by their primary

756
00:48:27,681 --> 00:48:31,010
partner. Maybe their primary partner just
doesn't enjoy that for whatever reason.

757
00:48:31,011 --> 00:48:33,620
But I don't know if that's accurate
since I'm not a sex worker myself.

758
00:48:33,621 --> 00:48:38,621
So w what are some of the most
frequently requested activities or act?

759
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:46,620
I think this one may be more specific
to me than necessarily the experience of

760
00:48:46,621 --> 00:48:47,454
other ladies.

761
00:48:47,670 --> 00:48:52,350
But very frequently I have men coming to
me that want to have sex while standing

762
00:48:52,410 --> 00:48:55,800
up because I'm so petite,
I only weigh 85 pounds.

763
00:48:55,830 --> 00:48:59,940
You can literally pick me up and have
sex while standing in a variety of

764
00:48:59,941 --> 00:49:00,960
different positions.

765
00:49:01,290 --> 00:49:04,980
I also happen to be extremely flexible
so I get a lot of requests for a

766
00:49:04,981 --> 00:49:09,981
Kamasutra positions or
perhaps some sexually creative
possessions where the man

767
00:49:10,651 --> 00:49:14,580
is standing and the woman is in doggy
position at the end of the bed or perhaps

768
00:49:14,581 --> 00:49:18,940
we're having sex using a chair or in
the case of someone with disabilities,

769
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:22,740
perhaps we're having sex and using
their wheelchair as sex furniture.

770
00:49:23,010 --> 00:49:25,650
All of those things often are requested.

771
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:30,690
Oral sex also huge, huge
request. It feels great.

772
00:49:30,691 --> 00:49:34,590
A lot of guys enjoy that sensation
because like you had mentioned earlier,

773
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:39,740
it truly is a rarity and for them it's
a treats as far as specific sexposition

774
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:44,070
goes when then you have got
to start writing your men.

775
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:48,180
They really like it when a girl is on
top and is willing to take control.

776
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:53,630
Oftentimes in modern society we still
see this paradigm of man on top woman

777
00:49:55,051 --> 00:50:00,051
below this standard missionary position
being the one and only position that men

778
00:50:00,271 --> 00:50:03,210
are getting to experience
with any sort of frequency.

779
00:50:03,390 --> 00:50:08,390
So a variety of positions
are often requested from
cow girl to reverse cow girl

780
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:12,900
doggy style and everything in between.

781
00:50:14,290 --> 00:50:18,130
You mentioned, I'm sure we'll come
back to a lot of different details,

782
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:23,160
but you mentioned in passing sex surrogacy
and I was hoping you could just take

783
00:50:23,981 --> 00:50:25,780
a minute and define what that is.

784
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:28,410
Oh,
absolutely.

785
00:50:28,411 --> 00:50:32,760
Sex surrogacy is kind of an interesting
thing because the definition tends to be

786
00:50:33,090 --> 00:50:35,430
personal.
With that being said,

787
00:50:35,431 --> 00:50:40,050
a universal way of looking at sex or I
guess see in the most simplest of forms

788
00:50:40,051 --> 00:50:45,051
is that rather than entering a
traditional relationship with say a,

789
00:50:47,311 --> 00:50:51,060
um, the average woman that
you would meet at a bar,

790
00:50:51,450 --> 00:50:56,450
you are instead choosing to enter
into a longer based relationship.

791
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:03,020
In this case with a sex worker in kind
of replacing the traditional girlfriend

792
00:51:03,811 --> 00:51:07,950
or wife with core doesn't
s court companion.

793
00:51:08,250 --> 00:51:12,390
You're filling that role with something
other than what is the societal norm.

794
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:15,540
It's very interesting though
because when you think about it,

795
00:51:16,110 --> 00:51:19,830
didn't the King of England have
multiple ladies in waiting?

796
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:24,840
Didn't he have multiple women that he
was having affairs with and having sex

797
00:51:24,841 --> 00:51:28,890
with? And that's really
true for a lot of history.

798
00:51:28,891 --> 00:51:33,891
When you look back that having this
secondary person or oftentimes in the case

799
00:51:34,741 --> 00:51:35,820
of sex surrogacy,

800
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,560
this primary person being the person who
is taking care of your sexual needs and

801
00:51:40,561 --> 00:51:45,300
desires, it certainly deviates from
what we would expect out of society.

802
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:48,053
And uh,

803
00:51:49,590 --> 00:51:54,150
does this combine then in some
cases or is it separate from a,

804
00:51:54,151 --> 00:51:56,490
because this is,
this is something else that I wrote down,

805
00:51:56,550 --> 00:51:58,740
a consensual nonmonogamous,

806
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:03,860
which it seems like you're an advocate
for or at least know quite a bit about or

807
00:52:05,110 --> 00:52:08,700
are there particular, and I know
this is a blended question, but are,

808
00:52:08,701 --> 00:52:13,260
do you have guidelines for people who
are interested in exploring consensual,

809
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:14,290
non monogamy?

810
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:18,720
Absolutely.
Consensual non-monogamy.

811
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:24,020
First off is defined as your
partner knowingly allowing
you to go ahead and have

812
00:52:25,581 --> 00:52:30,320
sex with another person.
In this particular case with a sex worker,

813
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:35,450
this has a couple of unique advantages
over any other kind of consensual

814
00:52:35,451 --> 00:52:39,080
non-monogamy because first off,
you know that we're professional.

815
00:52:39,081 --> 00:52:43,700
You know that I'm not seeking to steal
your husband and try to marry him.

816
00:52:43,701 --> 00:52:47,780
That could be the versus thing
from the case. And second,

817
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:53,290
oftentimes there's a medical reason
as to why people are interested in

818
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:56,780
consensual or non monogamy.
For example,

819
00:52:56,781 --> 00:53:01,781
the wife may have ovarian cancer and is
unable to have sex because of the simple

820
00:53:02,541 --> 00:53:05,930
medical recent that it's,
it's not feasible at that time.

821
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:11,200
She may go ahead and acknowledge that
her sexual needs and wants and desires.

822
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:14,570
She's not able to take care of
those for her husband at that time.

823
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:19,460
I'm a very firm believer that
sex is a need, not just a want.

824
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:21,310
It's been shown time and time again.

825
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:26,320
It has a positive psychological effect
on someone and it absolutely has positive

826
00:53:26,881 --> 00:53:30,210
effects in the overall experience of life.

827
00:53:30,390 --> 00:53:34,290
So by going ahead and allowing her
significant other to see the sex worker,

828
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:38,880
she is acknowledging not just his sexual
needs but also doing so in the most

829
00:53:38,881 --> 00:53:40,920
ethical way possible.

830
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:45,750
Your paying simply for a service
which I am simply providing.

831
00:53:45,751 --> 00:53:49,920
I'm taking care of the need that at
that particular time you're not able to

832
00:53:49,921 --> 00:53:54,780
fulfill. The wife has able to have a
say over that because it's consensual.

833
00:53:54,781 --> 00:53:56,700
She's able to dictate,
okay,

834
00:53:56,701 --> 00:54:00,150
these are this specific sex
acts that I am comfortable with.

835
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:05,300
Or instead say I am comfortable with
everything but these particular acts and

836
00:54:06,391 --> 00:54:09,630
then she's allowed to
then contribute her input.

837
00:54:09,930 --> 00:54:13,560
So as far as guidelines go for someone
that was interested in something like

838
00:54:13,561 --> 00:54:16,830
that, we have to go back to the
same number one I said earlier,

839
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:21,270
communication and the willingness to have
that communication followed by number

840
00:54:21,271 --> 00:54:25,140
two, consent. If you can get those
two bullet points checked off,

841
00:54:25,141 --> 00:54:29,190
then you're well on your way to going
ahead and entering this time of dynamic.

842
00:54:30,530 --> 00:54:34,000
Uh, you, you mentioned, uh,

843
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:37,270
before I completely derailed
the train of thought,

844
00:54:37,510 --> 00:54:42,510
one example of type of client
and you mentioned couples.

845
00:54:44,230 --> 00:54:44,890
Uh,

846
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:49,890
my understanding is that you also have
worked with a fair number of adult

847
00:54:51,011 --> 00:54:55,720
versions. Is that, is that
accurate? Can you explain,

848
00:54:57,580 --> 00:55:00,010
just walk us through what that
experience is like. I mean,

849
00:55:00,011 --> 00:55:04,090
how do you take someone,
uh, presumably male,

850
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:06,400
although that may not always be the case.
Uh,

851
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:09,550
and how do you make them comfortable?

852
00:55:09,551 --> 00:55:11,560
How do you walk them
through that experience?

853
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:17,510
The very, very first thing, and I keep
coming back to the same number one here,

854
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:22,100
it seems to be very prevalent throughout
my work is the very first thing is that

855
00:55:22,101 --> 00:55:26,870
communication aspect of getting to know
them as a human before getting to know

856
00:55:26,871 --> 00:55:28,640
them.
As a sexual cumin,

857
00:55:28,970 --> 00:55:32,420
I want to find out what someone's
hobbies and interests are.

858
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:37,540
I'd love to see a photo of someone's dog
or hear about a funny story from when

859
00:55:37,551 --> 00:55:38,390
they grew up.

860
00:55:38,690 --> 00:55:42,950
That allows us to connect first on that
friend level where we have that openness.

861
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:43,971
At that point,

862
00:55:43,971 --> 00:55:48,800
I'm able to then ask questions such as
what kind of sexual experiences have you

863
00:55:48,801 --> 00:55:53,420
had or what kind of sexual
experiences have you not had?

864
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:58,370
In many times of virgins,
adult versions have never been on a date.

865
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,290
They've never had a first kiss.

866
00:56:00,530 --> 00:56:04,970
They've oftentimes never proceeded
past first or second phase,

867
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,510
so in their heads,
they're really not just an adult virgin,

868
00:56:08,511 --> 00:56:13,280
but they're a virgin to the whole
dating experience. In America.

869
00:56:13,281 --> 00:56:18,281
Unfortunately society favorites women
when it comes to sex and relationships

870
00:56:19,370 --> 00:56:22,850
where women are sawed off to after by men,

871
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:26,170
but men aren't oftentimes
as sought after by women.

872
00:56:26,410 --> 00:56:31,030
Therefore we have a large sector of
the population which is male and also a

873
00:56:31,031 --> 00:56:34,600
virgin in their twenties
thirties forties and up.

874
00:56:34,810 --> 00:56:38,080
They've simply either never had
the time to have the encounter.

875
00:56:38,290 --> 00:56:40,660
The opportunity has
never presented itself.

876
00:56:40,661 --> 00:56:45,220
They've never specifically sought out
something like that or perhaps they hire

877
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:46,083
anxious.

878
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:49,660
Perhaps they haven't had the ability
to do so because they feel limited by a

879
00:56:49,661 --> 00:56:52,180
disability.
For example,

880
00:56:52,181 --> 00:56:56,860
a large number of the adult versions I
work with fall on the autism spectrum and

881
00:56:56,920 --> 00:57:01,600
for me it's understanding who someone is
as a person and then understanding who

882
00:57:01,601 --> 00:57:06,601
they want to be as a sexual person and
kind of developing our own customized

883
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:11,620
date experience that allows
them to experience the
things that is that they are

884
00:57:11,621 --> 00:57:12,454
missing.

885
00:57:12,990 --> 00:57:13,790
So this,

886
00:57:13,790 --> 00:57:18,790
this is fascinating with someone who
say has autism and there's of course an

887
00:57:19,221 --> 00:57:23,060
entire spectrum depending
on the severity of

888
00:57:25,070 --> 00:57:28,040
symptoms or the or the,
the way it's been diagnosed and so on.

889
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:33,140
But that would seem to also challenge
maybe in some ways the tool that you keep

890
00:57:33,141 --> 00:57:37,080
referring to, which is communication and
asking the right questions and so on. Uh,

891
00:57:37,790 --> 00:57:41,720
so what are some of the things
you've learned after you've,

892
00:57:41,721 --> 00:57:45,230
say heard a story or two,
looked at a photo of a dog,

893
00:57:45,530 --> 00:57:49,520
had a little bit of time to get the,
get to know them as a person.

894
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:55,300
Now it's time to progress to maybe phase
two where you're starting to get to get

895
00:57:56,901 --> 00:58:00,140
to not only know them, but explore
them as a physical human being,

896
00:58:00,141 --> 00:58:01,100
a sexual human being.

897
00:58:01,970 --> 00:58:05,750
What are some of the things
that you do to facilitate that?

898
00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:10,420
I like to communicate on
several different levels.

899
00:58:10,510 --> 00:58:12,730
Communication isn't just a verbal,

900
00:58:12,731 --> 00:58:16,420
a lot of our communication is
humans comes from that more subtle,

901
00:58:16,421 --> 00:58:19,300
either facial features,
body posturing,

902
00:58:19,450 --> 00:58:22,060
how we lean in or lean
away from something.

903
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:24,970
And so when I'm working with
somebody physically hands on,

904
00:58:24,971 --> 00:58:28,510
I'm also trying to read some of their
body language and look for the social cues

905
00:58:28,511 --> 00:58:33,511
that someone is calming down in their
respiratory rate as relaxed or instead

906
00:58:34,181 --> 00:58:38,230
they're leaning into an embrace rather
than hesitant and pulling away and

907
00:58:38,231 --> 00:58:40,930
perhaps more nervous.
For me,

908
00:58:40,931 --> 00:58:45,931
I never proceed to the next step or the
next level of intimacy until we have

909
00:58:47,441 --> 00:58:52,270
reached that comfort barrier and then
we're both ready to progress forward. Um,

910
00:58:52,810 --> 00:58:57,810
a number of my clients are war vets
and they left for the military and

911
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:03,790
completely lost the ability to have
that normal first relationship.

912
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:06,790
Now that they're getting to
explore it for the first time,

913
00:59:06,791 --> 00:59:11,440
they're dealing with a number of
different things, some of which have PTSD,

914
00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:14,230
some of which have hearing
loss from explosives.

915
00:59:14,410 --> 00:59:17,980
And so I have to be willing to
communicate on whatever language basis,

916
00:59:17,981 --> 00:59:21,770
either verbally or non verbally
that they're communicating in.

917
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:25,490
So I have to have a certain
level of flexibility when
working with adult virgins

918
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:28,490
because you really want to cater that
experience and really create something

919
00:59:28,491 --> 00:59:29,720
that's going to be special,

920
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:34,990
memorable and personal ball because
this is a unique experience for them.

921
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:39,440
There will never be a another
first other than this one thing.

922
00:59:39,441 --> 00:59:41,720
So the way I look at it,

923
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:46,130
I want to make that first time
be everything they ever dreamed,

924
00:59:46,131 --> 00:59:47,270
hoped and desired.

925
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:51,170
So I'd like to get into some
specifics related to that.

926
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:56,260
So I remember when I lost my virginity
and as I suppose fortunate to be pretty

927
00:59:57,351 --> 00:59:58,700
young at the time,

928
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,600
but I was a nervous wreck.

929
01:00:02,601 --> 01:00:05,300
I mean I think that many guys are.

930
01:00:05,301 --> 01:00:07,700
So let's say that you're,

931
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:13,120
you're sitting down with someone who's
under very understandably nervous on,

932
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,440
on some or many different levels.

933
01:00:15,650 --> 01:00:20,000
What are some of the specific things that
you've done or questions you've asked

934
01:00:20,001 --> 01:00:25,001
or things that you've said to make
them less nervous to make them more

935
01:00:25,551 --> 01:00:27,170
comfortable?
I know it depends on the person,

936
01:00:27,171 --> 01:00:31,310
but what are some specific examples
that you can give of anything that that

937
01:00:31,311 --> 01:00:36,311
you've done across clients to help them
to melt into the moment so that they can

938
01:00:40,521 --> 01:00:42,620
be less preoccupied and nervous?

939
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:48,960
Absolutely. I think that happens
on multiple different levels.

940
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:52,860
The first thing I do is I like to create
a certain ambiance in my room when we

941
01:00:52,861 --> 01:00:53,521
walk in.

942
01:00:53,521 --> 01:00:57,540
I like to create a visual change by
going ahead and lowering the lights and I

943
01:00:57,541 --> 01:01:00,120
put on the little bit of
relaxing background music.

944
01:01:00,180 --> 01:01:03,690
This way the rest of the world and the
rest of the brothel and the rest of

945
01:01:03,691 --> 01:01:07,350
everything has the opportunity to
kind of melt away for a moment.

946
01:01:07,351 --> 01:01:11,370
It's creating a space specifically for
this encounter and kind of setting the

947
01:01:11,371 --> 01:01:15,480
stage that helps with that first
step of visual of relaxation.

948
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:19,390
Do I to go to background
music? Do you have any, any,

949
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:21,370
any particular background
music that you like?

950
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:26,840
I love Enya huge fan of Enya.
It's soft, it's melodic,

951
01:01:26,841 --> 01:01:27,920
it's relaxing.

952
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:33,100
It's very easy to take that to our
romantic place and it's not so dominating

953
01:01:33,291 --> 01:01:37,520
lyrically that it would inhibit
conversation and communication.

954
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:40,790
It just flows very calmly and
naturally in the background.

955
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:45,590
Another one I really enjoy is
Lindsey sterlings violin pieces.

956
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:48,950
Those can be a lot of fun if you want
something a little bit more upbeat and

957
01:01:48,951 --> 01:01:51,740
energetic,
that's a lot of fun to listen to.

958
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:56,980
And then the genre of chill step is the
third music choice I tend to go to tends

959
01:01:58,551 --> 01:02:02,510
to have a little bit more of a beat and
a rhythm to it and kind of help set more

960
01:02:02,511 --> 01:02:04,370
of that sexual tempo.

961
01:02:04,890 --> 01:02:08,010
Love it. All right, very
helpful. Okay, please continue.

962
01:02:08,011 --> 01:02:12,030
So you've set the the
room tone so to speak.

963
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:14,520
What's what,
what then?

964
01:02:15,620 --> 01:02:15,801
Well,

965
01:02:15,801 --> 01:02:20,801
go ahead and assume that the person I'm
working with here is a neurotypical male

966
01:02:21,121 --> 01:02:25,800
virgin who has never even so
much as kissed a woman before.

967
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:29,670
And this is something I see
almost every single week.

968
01:02:30,030 --> 01:02:34,410
So the very first thing that we need
to do is established a physical,

969
01:02:34,740 --> 01:02:35,670
physical connection.

970
01:02:35,671 --> 01:02:39,930
This starts oftentimes with handholding
and interlacing of the fingers playing

971
01:02:39,931 --> 01:02:44,760
with the fingertips and encouraging
them to reciprocate that same motion,

972
01:02:44,910 --> 01:02:48,150
touching my fingertip,
stroking my hand. From there,

973
01:02:48,151 --> 01:02:53,030
that progress is to perhaps gentle kisses
across the neck and shoulder for you

974
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:55,740
Jen. Something that is a
little bit less intimate.

975
01:02:55,830 --> 01:02:59,340
Then lips on lips contact
for that first time,

976
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:04,050
kind of allowing someone to experience
what that sensation is like cause just

977
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:07,380
just stop for a moment and imagine that
you've never kissed a woman before.

978
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:10,680
You have no idea what that sensation
is going to be like on your lips.

979
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:12,900
Is there a taste to the skin?

980
01:03:12,901 --> 01:03:17,400
How does the smell of her perfume
or the shampoo she used affect your

981
01:03:17,401 --> 01:03:21,450
experience?
By slowing things down and really,

982
01:03:21,451 --> 01:03:24,810
really exploring that first
few steps of intimacy,

983
01:03:25,890 --> 01:03:30,360
it allows you to explore the depth of it
and really appreciate that act for what

984
01:03:30,361 --> 01:03:35,040
it is for play.
Going ahead and just having very,

985
01:03:35,041 --> 01:03:36,990
very nontraditional foreplay,

986
01:03:36,991 --> 01:03:41,991
such as gentle shoulder rubbing using
my fingers to run them through someone's

987
01:03:42,361 --> 01:03:46,170
hair or tracing my fingertip
over the outer edge of their ear,

988
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:50,340
maybe running my fingers along
their lower edge of their jaw.

989
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:54,670
Those little acts of touching
connection communicates nonverbally.

990
01:03:54,870 --> 01:03:58,410
That one,
it's okay to touch me too and to,

991
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:01,530
this is going to be a relaxing experience.

992
01:04:01,531 --> 01:04:04,620
I'm not going to try to undress someone,
have them on the bed,

993
01:04:04,621 --> 01:04:09,150
on their back and try to hop on top
of them and ride them til they orgasm.

994
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:11,190
That's not good.

995
01:04:11,490 --> 01:04:16,490
That would be the exact opposite of the
kind of experience I want to create for

996
01:04:16,501 --> 01:04:17,610
my mail virgins.

997
01:04:17,850 --> 01:04:22,850
I want them to really appreciate
that sexual connection.

998
01:04:23,730 --> 01:04:26,010
Another thing that's
worth mentioning here too,

999
01:04:26,250 --> 01:04:28,170
and this is a very interesting thing,

1000
01:04:28,650 --> 01:04:33,650
that more frequently than
not male versions are not
able to reach orgasm during

1001
01:04:33,871 --> 01:04:37,410
their first sexual experience
because of nerves and anxiety.

1002
01:04:37,411 --> 01:04:42,330
It often does affect performance
and that is a very normal biological

1003
01:04:42,331 --> 01:04:43,164
occurrence.

1004
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:48,060
It's not something to be ashamed of or
feel as if that ruins your experience.

1005
01:04:48,090 --> 01:04:53,090
So I also like to set up the intention
that the goal is to explore each other

1006
01:04:53,231 --> 01:04:58,170
sexually. And if we manage
to achieve orgasm during
that process, all the better.

1007
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:02,880
But I don't like to place an emphasis
on we're going until you orgasm because

1008
01:05:02,970 --> 01:05:07,350
sex is so much more than the
big finish, sexist, the journey.

1009
01:05:07,350 --> 01:05:12,210
It's an adventure. It's not just
sex, penis and vagina. It's,

1010
01:05:12,211 --> 01:05:13,800
it's so much more than that.

1011
01:05:14,070 --> 01:05:18,940
And so I'd say overall from my virgins
to make them feel comfortable is I let

1012
01:05:18,941 --> 01:05:22,960
them know that it's not just sex,
it's the touches, it's the kisses,

1013
01:05:22,961 --> 01:05:27,010
it's their first kiss when I'm looking
at them directly in the eye and I'm

1014
01:05:27,220 --> 01:05:31,930
reaching my hand behind them and lowering
their head towards mind and giving

1015
01:05:31,931 --> 01:05:35,410
them that self confidence to reach
out and lean forward and kissed me,

1016
01:05:35,411 --> 01:05:40,060
that that's an incredibly powerful thing
and it's an amazing gift to be able to

1017
01:05:40,061 --> 01:05:41,530
give another human being.

1018
01:05:43,590 --> 01:05:44,770
Definitely.
Uh,

1019
01:05:45,910 --> 01:05:50,910
I think these examples you've given have
been very helpful in terms of a client

1020
01:05:52,980 --> 01:05:57,980
demographics and characteristics because
many people listening may have had

1021
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:02,100
before listening to this,

1022
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:07,520
a certain image in their
head of the client.

1023
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:12,180
Like who is the client who comes to,
who goes to a brothel,

1024
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:15,270
uh, or works with escorts, for instance,

1025
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:18,180
what I mean,

1026
01:06:18,181 --> 01:06:23,181
who goes to the ranch or
works with sex workers?

1027
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:28,230
If you had to, to, to, to broadly
paint, I mean, are there certain,

1028
01:06:28,670 --> 01:06:33,300
are there certain demographics or
psychographics that are particularly

1029
01:06:33,301 --> 01:06:34,134
prevalent?

1030
01:06:34,810 --> 01:06:39,810
The easiest picture that I can paint is
somebody who is over the legal age of

1031
01:06:40,091 --> 01:06:43,930
consent. And with this, I will mention
too, in that the northern brothels,

1032
01:06:43,931 --> 01:06:47,980
you have to be 18 years of age. In the
southern brothels which are near Vegas,

1033
01:06:47,981 --> 01:06:51,400
you do have to be 21 of age.
So do keep those things in mind.

1034
01:06:51,730 --> 01:06:56,350
You have to meet the age requirements
to enter the brothel and that's it,

1035
01:06:57,450 --> 01:07:01,900
that that's literally the only requirement
to be able to come to a brothel.

1036
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:04,810
I see men,
I see women,

1037
01:07:04,811 --> 01:07:09,160
I see individuals who are intersex.
I have folks that are trans.

1038
01:07:09,490 --> 01:07:13,360
I have folks that come to see me
with no interest in sex at all,

1039
01:07:13,361 --> 01:07:17,740
that are completely asexual and instead
they just want to have experiences and

1040
01:07:17,741 --> 01:07:20,920
cuddle with me.
I see couples and adult virgins.

1041
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:26,100
I see nonverbal individuals who have
to communicate using a tablet and I see

1042
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:32,740
folks that are in their seventies who
are mourning the loss of their wife of 50

1043
01:07:32,741 --> 01:07:33,574
years.

1044
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:38,640
I see everything from adult virgins who
are 18 years in age to adult virgins who

1045
01:07:38,861 --> 01:07:40,120
are 50 years of age.

1046
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:45,300
I see men who haven't had sex in 25
years and I see men who have sex on the

1047
01:07:45,371 --> 01:07:49,450
frequent but they have a very specific
fetish that they can't ask their general,

1048
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:52,750
like their general sex
partner to fulfill for them.

1049
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:58,160
It is such an incredible rainbow of people
that come to see me for just a huge,

1050
01:08:01,750 --> 01:08:06,750
huge variety of women and unfortunately
our society kind of has this stigma in a

1051
01:08:07,451 --> 01:08:07,601
way.

1052
01:08:07,601 --> 01:08:12,130
When we think of whoever awful client
is where we painted this picture of this

1053
01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:17,340
CD guy in his thirties isn't really
well kept and probably has tattoos and

1054
01:08:19,370 --> 01:08:24,370
piercings and just as disrespectful
negative character I'm society.

1055
01:08:24,740 --> 01:08:29,390
We have all these negative
connotations with sex work, sex, work,

1056
01:08:29,391 --> 01:08:33,890
clients with the reality of sex work
is in this country that when you take a

1057
01:08:33,891 --> 01:08:35,690
step back and look at the reality,

1058
01:08:36,110 --> 01:08:41,110
I see everybody from the mailman to
people who work in governmental office.

1059
01:08:42,290 --> 01:08:45,080
The range is absolutely incredible.

1060
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:50,570
What are some other
misconceptions about sex work?

1061
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:53,840
Sex Workers, clients thereof, uh, any,

1062
01:08:53,841 --> 01:08:56,770
any other misconceptions
in particular that you'd,

1063
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:59,000
that you'd like to speak to or

1064
01:09:01,060 --> 01:09:02,890
in regards to the women themselves?

1065
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:07,920
There's this misconception about sex
workers that we ended up here because of

1066
01:09:08,621 --> 01:09:13,390
something that rather than choosing were
reacting to something that happened to

1067
01:09:13,391 --> 01:09:16,480
us that could not be
further from the choose.

1068
01:09:16,810 --> 01:09:21,610
The majority of women that come to work
at the brothels are incredibly well

1069
01:09:21,611 --> 01:09:22,570
educated,

1070
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:27,600
come from a variety of
different backgrounds all
over the country and a whole

1071
01:09:27,611 --> 01:09:32,020
array of different ages and body types.
Like to give you an idea,

1072
01:09:32,021 --> 01:09:36,370
one of my coworkers, Emilia
heart, she is just incredible.

1073
01:09:36,371 --> 01:09:38,170
She has multiple college degrees.

1074
01:09:38,171 --> 01:09:43,171
She's a massage therapist and is truly
a brilliant mind meeting her for the

1075
01:09:43,301 --> 01:09:47,980
first time. You wouldn't realize just how
well educated she is until you get that

1076
01:09:47,981 --> 01:09:52,270
opportunity to sit down with her and you
hear the quality of what she's saying

1077
01:09:52,271 --> 01:09:57,271
and you realize this is somebody that
could be pursuing a doctorate if they so

1078
01:09:57,461 --> 01:09:58,294
chose,

1079
01:09:58,300 --> 01:10:03,300
but instead they've chosen to go
ahead and embrace sex work and the one

1080
01:10:04,361 --> 01:10:09,130
commonality that I have found between
the women who choose to do sex work and

1081
01:10:09,131 --> 01:10:14,131
then furthermore choose to do sex work
on a longterm basis for be that six

1082
01:10:15,041 --> 01:10:17,020
months, a year, two years.

1083
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:22,500
Those ladies all look as sex work as
a form of service to the community.

1084
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:26,080
It's something that we're
able to do a genuine need.

1085
01:10:26,081 --> 01:10:31,081
The society has and has always had that
we're fulfilling or fulfilling a service

1086
01:10:31,271 --> 01:10:36,040
just like anybody else, any other
legal profession. We pay our taxes.

1087
01:10:36,340 --> 01:10:41,340
We have to pass a stringent background
check in order to have a license to work

1088
01:10:42,551 --> 01:10:47,551
at the ranch for a required by law to
go ahead and be tested for STDs and STDs

1089
01:10:49,721 --> 01:10:53,050
every single week.
It's an incredibly professional,

1090
01:10:53,051 --> 01:10:57,610
upscale environment with
incredibly high class women.

1091
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:03,120
And I wish that Maura Society
would understand that sex
is truly a societal need

1092
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:11,260
and so long as that need exists, sex
work will always be the natural answer.

1093
01:11:12,450 --> 01:11:13,890
Well, I think this, this is

1094
01:11:14,610 --> 01:11:18,540
an important point because in the u
s at least and elsewhere, certainly,

1095
01:11:18,541 --> 01:11:20,640
I mean if you look at the war on drugs,

1096
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:25,320
which has been by almost any measure
in a bismal failure with all sorts of

1097
01:11:25,321 --> 01:11:30,300
perverse side effects and costs
and ruin lives associated.

1098
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:31,050
If you,

1099
01:11:31,050 --> 01:11:36,050
if you take something that
is even more so in a neat,

1100
01:11:38,490 --> 01:11:40,170
uh,
human,

1101
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:45,200
not just drive but need like sex and try
to in any way repress it or prevent it

1102
01:11:49,651 --> 01:11:50,670
completely,

1103
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:56,120
which certainly happens in many different
areas of the u s in different cultures

1104
01:11:56,671 --> 01:12:01,671
in the u s that it will find some type
of release valve whether you want it to

1105
01:12:02,701 --> 01:12:05,820
or not.
And that the more proactive,

1106
01:12:06,540 --> 01:12:08,560
intelligent,
uh,

1107
01:12:09,150 --> 01:12:13,830
sort of benevolent way to approach that
is to create a structure within which

1108
01:12:13,831 --> 01:12:18,831
you can explore that or
provide that safely with
proper regulation and taxes and

1109
01:12:20,791 --> 01:12:25,440
so on and so forth. So I really think
this is an important point to underscore,

1110
01:12:25,590 --> 01:12:30,300
uh, for many reasons. But the
question I wanted to ask you,

1111
01:12:30,301 --> 01:12:35,070
and maybe you can certainly provide
thoughts on some of the other ladies,

1112
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:40,071
but aside from the services component
and helping say these vets or,

1113
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:46,530
uh, clients who really need this,
what else do you get out of it? Like,

1114
01:12:46,531 --> 01:12:50,250
why do you, why do you do this? And it's
not a moral judgment at all. Like I, I'm,

1115
01:12:50,251 --> 01:12:53,730
I'm fascinated by it, uh,
clearly. But like what do you,

1116
01:12:53,790 --> 01:12:57,450
what do you personally get out of
this that makes you enjoy the work?

1117
01:12:58,860 --> 01:12:59,860
Well,
for me,

1118
01:12:59,890 --> 01:13:04,890
what I get out of it is a very honest
look at humanity and a very honest

1119
01:13:07,990 --> 01:13:12,990
connection with other human beings in
a deep and meaningful way that society

1120
01:13:15,251 --> 01:13:18,100
otherwise could not provide for me.

1121
01:13:18,340 --> 01:13:23,050
I've always long maintained that modern
America is trapped behind the cell

1122
01:13:23,051 --> 01:13:23,471
phone,

1123
01:13:23,471 --> 01:13:28,420
behind the computer screen or we no longer
interact with each other on that face

1124
01:13:28,421 --> 01:13:32,830
to face level. We don't hug each
other and we don't touch each other,

1125
01:13:33,130 --> 01:13:35,140
and by virtue of my job,

1126
01:13:35,170 --> 01:13:39,610
I don't get to just hug in touch
the other human beings in my world,

1127
01:13:39,910 --> 01:13:44,050
I get to interact with them in
incredibly deep, meaningful ways,

1128
01:13:44,051 --> 01:13:46,330
intimately,
intellectually,

1129
01:13:46,750 --> 01:13:51,130
and for me it's stimulating
and it's enriching in my life.

1130
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:55,630
I find that it gives my life value
and it gives my life purpose.

1131
01:13:56,320 --> 01:14:00,790
There's so much to be learned by just
getting to sit down with another human

1132
01:14:00,791 --> 01:14:04,540
being, let alone getting to enter
the bedroom with another human being.

1133
01:14:04,690 --> 01:14:07,450
It allows me to learn more
about myself at the same time.

1134
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:12,580
What have you learned about yourself
would you say over the two years?

1135
01:14:14,020 --> 01:14:14,590
Okay.

1136
01:14:14,590 --> 01:14:19,590
I've learned that I am an incredibly
confident woman and that I don't need to

1137
01:14:20,231 --> 01:14:22,540
overcompensate for anything.

1138
01:14:22,930 --> 01:14:27,930
Growing up four foot eight and being
head and shoulders below my peers,

1139
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:32,920
I always felt this internal competitive
nature like I'm not good enough.

1140
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:36,130
I have to work a little bit harder.
I have to be a little bit better.

1141
01:14:36,340 --> 01:14:40,180
I have to overcome what to
me felt like a handicap.

1142
01:14:40,420 --> 01:14:43,210
When you're very petite,
people look down on you.

1143
01:14:43,450 --> 01:14:47,620
They treat you like a young child
regardless of the fact that you're an

1144
01:14:47,621 --> 01:14:48,880
intelligent young woman,

1145
01:14:48,881 --> 01:14:53,230
they don't give you that
same level of respect.

1146
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:55,930
And so for me,

1147
01:14:55,931 --> 01:15:00,550
I learned to have that inner confidence
in myself and truly believe it and know

1148
01:15:00,551 --> 01:15:04,870
that my value and my worth is very,
very tangible.

1149
01:15:04,871 --> 01:15:05,651
It's very,

1150
01:15:05,651 --> 01:15:10,240
very real and it certainly isn't
inhibited by who I physically am.

1151
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:14,290
If anything, I've come to find my height
to be an advantage in my business,

1152
01:15:14,291 --> 01:15:17,050
which is kind of a great irony in a way.

1153
01:15:17,860 --> 01:15:22,490
Yeah, that's coming full circle.
I was looking at this description,

1154
01:15:22,670 --> 01:15:27,670
which was a striking with natural red
hair elfin features and a starting list

1155
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:30,830
startlingly petite four foot eight frames.

1156
01:15:30,831 --> 01:15:35,560
I mean that sounds to me like a very
strong set of differentiators, right?

1157
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:37,073
Right.

1158
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:41,850
You an idea like during the lineup I
literally will watch the guys will,

1159
01:15:41,851 --> 01:15:44,960
they'll make eye contact with each girls
and they'll reach me and you just see

1160
01:15:44,961 --> 01:15:48,410
their heads look all the way down because
they have to lower their head to make

1161
01:15:48,411 --> 01:15:52,550
eye contact with me in comparison to the
woman standing on my left and my right.

1162
01:15:52,850 --> 01:15:54,080
So it's very,
very fun.

1163
01:15:54,081 --> 01:15:57,380
You always get to see this funny little
head nod when I'm in a lineup and it

1164
01:15:57,630 --> 01:15:58,970
kind of makes me smile.

1165
01:15:59,670 --> 01:16:04,060
Uh, what, what have you learned about, uh,

1166
01:16:04,190 --> 01:16:08,150
what have you learned about men in the
last, it doesn't have to be two years,

1167
01:16:08,151 --> 01:16:12,170
but just in this work,
what are, what are, uh,

1168
01:16:13,910 --> 01:16:18,910
are there any particular insights that
you can share or things that you've

1169
01:16:20,031 --> 01:16:21,740
realized about men?

1170
01:16:21,741 --> 01:16:25,910
And I understand that there that men is
a huge category and that there are many,

1171
01:16:25,911 --> 01:16:26,361
many,
many,

1172
01:16:26,361 --> 01:16:30,380
many different types of men with
different likes and dislikes and so on.

1173
01:16:30,381 --> 01:16:33,770
But if you were trying to
generalize, are there any, are there,

1174
01:16:33,771 --> 01:16:38,090
is there anything in particular that
you would say you've learned about men?

1175
01:16:39,590 --> 01:16:44,590
I would say the biggest thing that I've
learned about men is that society judges

1176
01:16:45,651 --> 01:16:50,651
them and places this expectation of
toxic masculinity which prevents men from

1177
01:16:53,390 --> 01:16:58,390
embracing that emotional and
that sexual side of themselves.

1178
01:16:58,730 --> 01:17:01,490
That's incredible.
Lee limiting his society.

1179
01:17:01,491 --> 01:17:06,491
For us to have that kind of moral
judgment against 50% of the general

1180
01:17:06,711 --> 01:17:10,130
population. That's, that's craziness.

1181
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:13,520
We don't allow men to
express themselves sexually.

1182
01:17:13,521 --> 01:17:17,540
We don't allow men to express
themselves emotionally.

1183
01:17:17,780 --> 01:17:22,050
And when somebody comes to
see me at the ranch, all men,

1184
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:25,670
regardless of what they think that
they are coming to the brothel for,

1185
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:29,960
the primary reason that they are coming
to the brothel is because they want to

1186
01:17:29,961 --> 01:17:34,190
be heard. They want to be
listened to and most importantly,

1187
01:17:34,191 --> 01:17:35,930
they just want to be understood.

1188
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:39,860
What is,
what is it?

1189
01:17:39,861 --> 01:17:44,861
Is there a particular ask
or need or fantasy that guys
come to you with and they

1190
01:17:47,991 --> 01:17:52,190
think that it's somehow unique to them,
but in fact you see it all the time.

1191
01:17:52,220 --> 01:17:54,920
Is there anything that that
comes to mind that would,

1192
01:17:56,180 --> 01:18:01,180
that would I suppose fit
that fit those parameters?

1193
01:18:02,970 --> 01:18:06,180
I'd say there are two things that
I see that are most unexpected.

1194
01:18:06,510 --> 01:18:10,320
The first we've kind of already touched
on which our adult male virgins,

1195
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:14,520
many adult male versions come with this
fantasy of losing their virginity and

1196
01:18:14,521 --> 01:18:19,110
they don't realize that it's such a common
thing and they feel very insecure and

1197
01:18:19,111 --> 01:18:21,960
nervous about it when it's
actually a very common happening.

1198
01:18:22,140 --> 01:18:26,940
So that would probably be the first thing.
The second thing that I see very,

1199
01:18:26,941 --> 01:18:31,941
very frequently is men simply want to
have sex with a woman when she has her

1200
01:18:31,981 --> 01:18:32,850
eyes open.

1201
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:37,320
A lot of women have this interesting
habit where we close our eyes when we're

1202
01:18:37,321 --> 01:18:41,490
having sex where we don't want to make
that direct eye contact with our partner.

1203
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:44,490
For a lot of men,
they find that to be incredibly,

1204
01:18:44,491 --> 01:18:46,650
incredibly erotic and stimulating.

1205
01:18:46,770 --> 01:18:49,850
To see all the little micro
muscles move and twitches.

1206
01:18:49,860 --> 01:18:52,320
Somebody gets closer and closer to orgasm,

1207
01:18:52,650 --> 01:18:57,060
getting to feel their breath and also
see the expression change in their eyes

1208
01:18:57,061 --> 01:19:01,500
and in their face and watch their pupils
dilate and contract in response to what

1209
01:19:01,501 --> 01:19:06,090
you're physically doing. I mean, God,
it doesn't get much hotter than that.

1210
01:19:06,730 --> 01:19:08,290
No. Yeah, no it doesn't.

1211
01:19:08,291 --> 01:19:12,790
There's a site that I wrote about in my
second book for our body where they're

1212
01:19:12,791 --> 01:19:14,790
actually two chapters,
not just one,

1213
01:19:15,190 --> 01:19:18,250
two chapters dedicated to female
orgasm for this people interested,

1214
01:19:18,670 --> 01:19:22,960
but there's a site, I don't even know if
it's still around, I think it should be,

1215
01:19:22,961 --> 01:19:27,850
but it's called beautiful
agony and beautiful agony is,

1216
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:29,710
uh,
is

1217
01:19:31,450 --> 01:19:36,450
a site dedicated to user submitted videos
of faces as each person is orgasming.

1218
01:19:39,460 --> 01:19:43,390
So it's,
it's specifically focused on,

1219
01:19:44,250 --> 01:19:49,150
uh, faces during climax and orgasm.
So yes, I agree. That's, that's,

1220
01:19:49,420 --> 01:19:50,800
that makes perfect sense to me.

1221
01:19:50,801 --> 01:19:54,070
So men who wants to have sex with a
woman while she has her eyes open,

1222
01:19:55,130 --> 01:19:56,740
incredible.
Uh,

1223
01:19:57,700 --> 01:19:59,980
don't,
it seems such like a simple request to,

1224
01:19:59,981 --> 01:20:04,510
but honestly it can be kinda difficult
as women because you have to be really

1225
01:20:04,511 --> 01:20:08,220
confident in yourself,
sexually confident what you're doing,

1226
01:20:08,430 --> 01:20:12,060
a relaxed enough where you can make
eye contact and it not feel forced or

1227
01:20:12,061 --> 01:20:16,290
uncomfortable in an order for like eye
contact during sex to actually come off

1228
01:20:16,291 --> 01:20:18,420
in a way that's erotic.
You'd be surprised.

1229
01:20:18,421 --> 01:20:20,430
It's actually more difficult
than you would think.

1230
01:20:21,230 --> 01:20:24,650
Well,
just maintaining eye contact in general.

1231
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:27,440
I think in conversation for instance,

1232
01:20:27,441 --> 01:20:32,441
particularly particularly when talking
is difficult for a lot of people and like

1233
01:20:32,781 --> 01:20:37,640
anything else you have to
practice. It just requires mileage.

1234
01:20:37,641 --> 01:20:41,300
I mean, you really have to put in
the repetitions. A question for you,

1235
01:20:42,350 --> 01:20:44,750
uh,
I suppose it is,

1236
01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:49,820
is somewhat related because
you mentioned the, the Gfe,

1237
01:20:49,821 --> 01:20:54,020
right? The girlfriend experience
is the number one request,

1238
01:20:54,110 --> 01:20:56,000
the requested service that you offer.

1239
01:20:56,450 --> 01:21:01,450
Now I find this kind of puzzling in a
sense and I'd love to hear your additional

1240
01:21:01,791 --> 01:21:06,230
thoughts. And the reason I say
it's puzzling is that I know,

1241
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:07,153
uh,

1242
01:21:07,580 --> 01:21:12,580
I mean among say type a successful
males who have traveled a lot around the

1243
01:21:14,541 --> 01:21:19,490
world. It's, it's, at least in my
experience, I mean the vast majority,

1244
01:21:19,730 --> 01:21:23,570
particularly overseas,
but not necessarily limited to overseas,

1245
01:21:23,660 --> 01:21:27,560
have had experiences with sex workers.
Very, very, very, very common.

1246
01:21:27,950 --> 01:21:29,870
And for many of them,

1247
01:21:30,610 --> 01:21:35,610
they choose to go to sex workers because
they don't want to contend with the

1248
01:21:35,961 --> 01:21:40,490
emotional elements of a relationship
or potential attachment or follow up.

1249
01:21:40,850 --> 01:21:45,650
They have this sexual need and they view,
uh,

1250
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:50,680
visiting sex workers as a very sort of
clean and simple way to satisfy that.

1251
01:21:52,101 --> 01:21:53,930
So,
so why is the,

1252
01:21:54,020 --> 01:21:59,000
the girlfriend experience
the most requested?

1253
01:21:59,630 --> 01:22:02,600
I, it's, yeah, yeah,
yeah. No, it's, it's, uh,

1254
01:22:03,470 --> 01:22:07,880
that's very unexpected for me. Uh,
so maybe you can speak to that.

1255
01:22:09,370 --> 01:22:09,731
Sure.

1256
01:22:09,731 --> 01:22:14,350
And I'll even go ahead and speak as to
the specific example you gave these men

1257
01:22:14,351 --> 01:22:17,320
that travel for work,
they choose a specifically,

1258
01:22:17,321 --> 01:22:21,340
and this is a conscious decision to not
engaged in a traditional relationship.

1259
01:22:21,790 --> 01:22:25,570
Oftentimes what they will do is
they'll see the same lady on a frequent

1260
01:22:25,571 --> 01:22:28,780
reoccurring basis rather
than seeing different ladies.

1261
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:34,080
So in a way they are kind of entering
a unique committed sort of relationship

1262
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:42,480
within that bounded time constraints
that they are there together with that

1263
01:22:42,881 --> 01:22:47,290
person. It allows them to be in control
of the duration of the intimacy,

1264
01:22:47,530 --> 01:22:49,180
how that interaction goes,

1265
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:53,170
and you don't have to do any of that
maintenance and upkeep as a relationship

1266
01:22:53,171 --> 01:22:57,580
does. And then economically
speaking, interestingly enough,

1267
01:22:57,610 --> 01:23:02,020
it's cheaper to frequently visit sex
workers then actually have a wife and get

1268
01:23:02,021 --> 01:23:02,854
married.

1269
01:23:03,510 --> 01:23:06,130
Oh, that doesn't surprise me.
I mean I, I, yeah, I remember

1270
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:08,050
somebody,
I heard somebody say in a movie,

1271
01:23:08,051 --> 01:23:11,570
they said free sex is the
most expensive sexual ever.

1272
01:23:13,730 --> 01:23:14,451
Honestly,

1273
01:23:14,451 --> 01:23:19,451
it is so much easier to just seek out
a professional because if you have that

1274
01:23:20,451 --> 01:23:23,690
need and you need to get that need met,

1275
01:23:24,350 --> 01:23:28,760
going to the legal brothel is an
amazing solution. One, you know,

1276
01:23:28,761 --> 01:23:32,930
you're not going to catch anything because
we're literally tested every single

1277
01:23:32,930 --> 01:23:34,220
week.
Two,

1278
01:23:34,430 --> 01:23:38,570
you don't have to worry about any of
your private information being violated,

1279
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:43,040
especially for professional men that may
not want to be open or put themselves

1280
01:23:43,041 --> 01:23:45,050
at risk of doing any illegal activity.

1281
01:23:45,530 --> 01:23:50,000
Sex in Nevada at the brothels
is a hundred percent legal.

1282
01:23:50,270 --> 01:23:54,590
You can go ahead and pay for sex and
you don't have to worry about that legal

1283
01:23:54,591 --> 01:23:59,160
risk of things. So for a lot of men,
perhaps a huge advantage. Chill. Um,

1284
01:23:59,450 --> 01:24:03,410
another thing that I oftentimes see
with men that fall into that particular

1285
01:24:03,411 --> 01:24:08,411
situation is they enjoyed the
familiarity of the same individual girl,

1286
01:24:10,010 --> 01:24:14,930
but they know that they're not obligated
to do anything. They don't have to tax,

1287
01:24:14,931 --> 01:24:18,320
they don't have to call, they
don't have to say, where are you?

1288
01:24:18,321 --> 01:24:20,510
Why didn't you do the laundry?

1289
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:25,720
You don't get any of that nagging or any
of those negative relation things that

1290
01:24:26,030 --> 01:24:28,520
can be oftentimes detrimental and said,

1291
01:24:28,521 --> 01:24:31,340
you kind of get to cherry pick
the best parts of relationship.

1292
01:24:31,490 --> 01:24:34,100
You get to go out on
dates and have dinner.

1293
01:24:34,310 --> 01:24:38,750
We can rent a helicopter and fly over
Lake Tahoe and take photos together.

1294
01:24:39,190 --> 01:24:42,140
Whatever this scenario happens to be.

1295
01:24:42,860 --> 01:24:47,860
It gives you the exact experience you
want within the constraints of time that

1296
01:24:48,321 --> 01:24:52,940
you have available to yourself without
any sort of commitment or obligation

1297
01:24:52,941 --> 01:24:53,774
beyond that.

1298
01:24:54,550 --> 01:24:59,550
So I was just going to say it sort to
most of what you just said would lead the,

1299
01:25:00,490 --> 01:25:03,520
the friends that I mentioned before to
nod their heads and say yes, exactly.

1300
01:25:04,030 --> 01:25:04,863
So the,

1301
01:25:04,900 --> 01:25:09,490
where do we then find the
girlfriend experience,

1302
01:25:09,850 --> 01:25:14,430
uh, sort of falling in
terms of appeal, uh,

1303
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:17,770
because, uh, I'd love to
hear your thoughts on that.

1304
01:25:18,340 --> 01:25:20,740
And I should also say for people
listening, I mean, I think there is,

1305
01:25:21,310 --> 01:25:25,900
I certainly find value in relationships,
intimate relationships,

1306
01:25:25,901 --> 01:25:28,480
and sex with, with, uh,

1307
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:33,340
girlfriends that I'm in deep committed
relationships with. Nonetheless,

1308
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:36,850
I mean, this, this is,
I think another piece,

1309
01:25:36,851 --> 01:25:39,880
potentially another piece of the
puzzle that's worth at the very,

1310
01:25:40,060 --> 01:25:45,040
at a very minimum understanding.
So the, the Gfe, why is that?

1311
01:25:45,090 --> 01:25:49,180
Why, why is that the most requested?
Right? Because I mean, I guess in my mind,

1312
01:25:49,181 --> 01:25:50,800
maybe I'm just a savage,
but I'm thinking, all right,

1313
01:25:50,801 --> 01:25:52,120
if I'm going to pay for four hours,

1314
01:25:52,510 --> 01:25:54,550
I've already established
that I'm attracted to you.

1315
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:57,460
Why not have sex for four hours?

1316
01:25:58,580 --> 01:26:02,090
It certainly can do that.
No one is saying, no, no,

1317
01:26:02,710 --> 01:26:04,460
no stamina. Oh, please,

1318
01:26:08,260 --> 01:26:12,600
please, uh, please speak on the GFE. Why,

1319
01:26:12,601 --> 01:26:14,880
why is that the most
requested do you think?

1320
01:26:15,980 --> 01:26:16,790
Of course.

1321
01:26:16,790 --> 01:26:20,540
I think the first thing that needs to be
discussed is the girlfriend experience

1322
01:26:20,541 --> 01:26:23,810
is just that you are creating
an experience for somebody.

1323
01:26:24,110 --> 01:26:27,290
It's bounded by the constraints
of our time together.

1324
01:26:27,291 --> 01:26:30,590
It's not a perpetual relationship,
which is what makes it different than say,

1325
01:26:30,740 --> 01:26:35,210
a standard girlfriend.
It's an experience within that experience.

1326
01:26:35,211 --> 01:26:39,200
You're getting a couple of very
unique, um, let's call them features.

1327
01:26:39,680 --> 01:26:43,970
One of the features of the girlfriend
experiences that I specifically take my

1328
01:26:43,971 --> 01:26:48,770
time to get to know who somebody
is on an even greater level.

1329
01:26:49,100 --> 01:26:53,330
Because generally speaking,
within a GFE experience,

1330
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:55,970
we visit each other more than just once.

1331
01:26:55,971 --> 01:27:00,920
This isn't generally a
standalone encounter, but
rather a regular occurrence.

1332
01:27:00,921 --> 01:27:05,510
A couple times a year if somebody
lives locally, perhaps more frequently,

1333
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:09,020
whatever.
It's so maybe I digress a little bit here,

1334
01:27:09,170 --> 01:27:12,440
but it's kind of important to point
out that one of the classic features of

1335
01:27:12,441 --> 01:27:15,530
girlfriend experiences that
were frequently than not,

1336
01:27:15,531 --> 01:27:20,531
it tends to be a reoccurring experience
and it also allows us to develop a

1337
01:27:22,730 --> 01:27:26,270
relationship with each other.
For men,

1338
01:27:26,271 --> 01:27:30,230
emotion and sex very,
very frequently go hand in hand.

1339
01:27:30,380 --> 01:27:34,370
It's not just the pure physical arousal,
but it's also that mental stimulus.

1340
01:27:34,371 --> 01:27:38,000
It's being able to sit and have a quality
conversation with the woman you're

1341
01:27:38,001 --> 01:27:39,290
about to have sex with.

1342
01:27:39,291 --> 01:27:44,291
Like I think that's incredibly appealing
to sit down with somebody and have them

1343
01:27:45,050 --> 01:27:49,760
perhaps talk about astrophysics with me
before foreplay. Oh yeah. Bring it on.

1344
01:27:49,761 --> 01:27:52,160
That as foreplay for my brain right there.

1345
01:27:54,760 --> 01:27:55,593
What is the,

1346
01:27:55,720 --> 01:28:00,720
what is the average duration of
a girlfriend experience session,

1347
01:28:01,780 --> 01:28:02,613
so to speak?

1348
01:28:03,570 --> 01:28:08,100
I'd say on average between
the two to four hour range.

1349
01:28:08,340 --> 01:28:12,870
Of course I've had experiences more
limited that and then I've had experiences

1350
01:28:12,871 --> 01:28:14,850
more extend ewas than that sale.

1351
01:28:17,750 --> 01:28:19,670
I know this is going to seem
like a left turn, but we're,

1352
01:28:19,671 --> 01:28:21,900
we're going to jump all over the place.
What do you,

1353
01:28:22,050 --> 01:28:27,050
what are your feelings or
opinions of porn as a sex worker?

1354
01:28:29,070 --> 01:28:31,620
Ooh, that's a very
interesting question. Indeed.

1355
01:28:32,220 --> 01:28:35,250
I think that porn is ruining America.

1356
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:40,110
It's ruining relationships
and it's ruining intimacy.

1357
01:28:40,530 --> 01:28:45,530
What porn does is it creates this
almost addictive compulsion where you're

1358
01:28:46,801 --> 01:28:49,110
scrolling through,
you're watching the porn.

1359
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:53,730
We're going to assume it's a male
watching at this point, he's masturbating.

1360
01:28:53,731 --> 01:28:55,290
He is being very,

1361
01:28:55,291 --> 01:29:00,291
very rough with his genitalia and he
is just going at it for however long.

1362
01:29:00,391 --> 01:29:05,391
It's so May 1st rather than investing
his time and energy in a genuine

1363
01:29:06,631 --> 01:29:08,400
connection with a real human being.

1364
01:29:08,700 --> 01:29:13,700
He's watching the Broadway equivalent of
a sex act that is being overdramatized

1365
01:29:15,211 --> 01:29:18,870
for his entertainment because I'll tell
you right now that everything that women

1366
01:29:18,871 --> 01:29:23,130
do in porn is the exact opposite
of what happens in real life.

1367
01:29:25,140 --> 01:29:29,490
Secondly, it's causing men to
cause physical harm to themselves.

1368
01:29:29,700 --> 01:29:31,020
They're masturbating,

1369
01:29:31,021 --> 01:29:35,250
so roughly that oftentimes they'll lose
sensitivity and it makes it difficult

1370
01:29:35,251 --> 01:29:37,830
for them to orgasm and
climax with their partner,

1371
01:29:38,070 --> 01:29:43,070
which of course leads to the almost a
cycle of going back and masturbating

1372
01:29:43,741 --> 01:29:46,680
because they're not able to orgasm
with their significant other.

1373
01:29:46,681 --> 01:29:48,750
They have to have that rough stimulus.

1374
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:54,200
The third thing that it
does is it perpetuates this
culture where we look as sex

1375
01:29:57,811 --> 01:30:02,640
and we look at women as objects.
There is no real way to verify,

1376
01:30:02,730 --> 01:30:03,600
unfortunately,

1377
01:30:03,601 --> 01:30:07,890
that all of the porn that you're coming
across on these websites is consensual

1378
01:30:07,891 --> 01:30:12,510
porn. You have no idea how old are these
women necessarily are you have no, well,

1379
01:30:12,511 --> 01:30:14,820
if they've been
compensated for their time,

1380
01:30:15,180 --> 01:30:18,750
like unless you've really done your
research and you've picked an ethical porn

1381
01:30:18,751 --> 01:30:22,080
website that does perfect record
keeping based in the United States,

1382
01:30:22,081 --> 01:30:25,470
there's no guarantee and the
majority of guys that I know,

1383
01:30:25,471 --> 01:30:27,030
they just go to some website,

1384
01:30:27,031 --> 01:30:29,310
they just scroll through and they
clicked on the first thing that looks

1385
01:30:29,311 --> 01:30:32,940
interesting without a second thought as
to what the impact is on the lives of

1386
01:30:32,941 --> 01:30:37,710
the women and what kind of a
societal norm that perpetuates.

1387
01:30:37,980 --> 01:30:40,440
If we managed to remove
porn from our society,

1388
01:30:40,620 --> 01:30:45,180
I think you would see men spending more
time developing genuine connections with

1389
01:30:45,570 --> 01:30:47,910
other women.
They would be going out more.

1390
01:30:47,911 --> 01:30:52,620
They would be exploring those dynamics
and exploring those things rather than

1391
01:30:52,621 --> 01:30:57,000
that self-gratifying behavior
bitches also physically damaging.

1392
01:30:58,310 --> 01:31:00,510
Probably also be good for
business at the bunny ranch out.

1393
01:31:00,530 --> 01:31:05,030
Imagine if porn work to vanish overnight.

1394
01:31:05,300 --> 01:31:08,420
They suspect that you
guys would be overrun, but

1395
01:31:08,660 --> 01:31:10,690
it would be pandemonium.

1396
01:31:10,870 --> 01:31:14,770
And the very first thing that I
would have to do, believe it or not,

1397
01:31:15,100 --> 01:31:19,450
is invest in a ton of flash lights.
The number one,

1398
01:31:21,050 --> 01:31:24,890
my friend, my friend used to
sell this, he's, he was the,

1399
01:31:24,891 --> 01:31:28,220
he was the man behind the flashlight.
So maybe you can describe for people,

1400
01:31:29,880 --> 01:31:31,370
uh, why you would, why,

1401
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:33,860
what the fleshlight is and why you'd
be investing in the flashlight.

1402
01:31:35,070 --> 01:31:36,550
Well,
what the fleshlight is,

1403
01:31:36,551 --> 01:31:41,551
is it is an apparatus used for male sexual
gratification that is in a tube that

1404
01:31:43,331 --> 01:31:45,760
looks very much so like a flashlight.

1405
01:31:45,970 --> 01:31:48,850
But rather than having the
inner working light component,

1406
01:31:49,240 --> 01:31:54,240
instead it has an artificial vagina or
lips or Derriere or breast made out of

1407
01:31:58,031 --> 01:32:01,060
silicone or other
fleshlight feeling material,

1408
01:32:01,210 --> 01:32:06,100
which you then insert your penis
into for self gratification. Got It.

1409
01:32:06,140 --> 01:32:08,050
Wow.
That was really technical way to just,

1410
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:10,140
Oh,
so you would keep,

1411
01:32:10,590 --> 01:32:15,590
you would keep the fast running s porn
deprived maniacs at bay by sort of

1412
01:32:16,610 --> 01:32:21,610
hurling flashlights at them over some
type of barricade like hand grenades just

1413
01:32:21,621 --> 01:32:25,490
to make sure that,
that you can keep this tsunami

1414
01:32:27,130 --> 01:32:30,940
of sexual agitation at bay. Now
that makes sense. I like that. Uh,

1415
01:32:31,230 --> 01:32:33,660
be like Oprah Winfrey
and you get a flashlight.

1416
01:32:37,610 --> 01:32:37,900
Yeah.

1417
01:32:37,900 --> 01:32:41,680
Well you'd have to take all these guys
who spend too much time on laptops and

1418
01:32:41,681 --> 01:32:44,920
train them on how to catch things cause
you might just end up taking eyes out

1419
01:32:45,460 --> 01:32:47,200
with flashlights lots. But, but yes,

1420
01:32:48,620 --> 01:32:52,080
the reason why I specifically mentioned
flashlights is guys are hurting

1421
01:32:52,081 --> 01:32:54,660
themselves when they're masturbating
third gripping too tightly,

1422
01:32:54,661 --> 01:32:57,840
they're pulling too hard.
When you're using the flashlight,

1423
01:32:57,900 --> 01:33:01,950
it takes away that ability. It
completely takes it out of the equation.

1424
01:33:01,951 --> 01:33:05,100
So you're still able to get sexual
gratification with yourself,

1425
01:33:05,370 --> 01:33:09,240
but you're also not hurting yourself in
damaging your ability to enjoy sex with

1426
01:33:09,241 --> 01:33:12,240
a partner. So honestly, I
think all guys out there,

1427
01:33:12,241 --> 01:33:15,900
the number one things that they could
do for their own sexual wellness is by a

1428
01:33:15,901 --> 01:33:16,734
flashlight.

1429
01:33:18,580 --> 01:33:21,970
This episode of the Tim Ferriss show is
brought to you by the fleshlight. Okay.

1430
01:33:21,971 --> 01:33:22,870
That one was free.

1431
01:33:23,500 --> 01:33:28,270
Fleshlight please donate many
thousands of dollars to your favorite,

1432
01:33:28,410 --> 01:33:32,800
a benevolent cause, donorschoose.org
I'm sure we'll accept your money,

1433
01:33:33,310 --> 01:33:37,590
but a, yeah, you're welcome.
You're welcome. Flashlight.

1434
01:33:37,670 --> 01:33:41,270
You know, a couple slides, not a
replacement for a real human being.

1435
01:33:41,271 --> 01:33:44,750
It certainly isn't a replacement
for the true flesh and blood thing,

1436
01:33:45,080 --> 01:33:49,070
but it certainly is an alternative
option for single men out there who are

1437
01:33:49,430 --> 01:33:53,270
masturbating at home and are starting
to experience some of these sensitivity

1438
01:33:53,300 --> 01:33:53,930
issues.

1439
01:33:53,930 --> 01:33:57,800
It's something to bear in mind because
it's going to make her sexual experiences

1440
01:33:57,830 --> 01:34:00,470
so much more intense and so much better.

1441
01:34:01,230 --> 01:34:02,890
Yes. For the, uh,

1442
01:34:05,860 --> 01:34:10,710
for the real vagina deficient masses out
there who are masturbating themselves

1443
01:34:10,711 --> 01:34:14,760
into genital destruction.
Words to the wise. All right,

1444
01:34:14,761 --> 01:34:15,840
so let me,

1445
01:34:15,870 --> 01:34:20,870
let me segue on that
to googling your name.

1446
01:34:21,060 --> 01:34:21,331
All right.

1447
01:34:21,331 --> 01:34:26,331
So you have reviews online and
I've seen you described in very

1448
01:34:30,270 --> 01:34:35,010
laudable terms. So in one
word for instance, this is
one reviewer in one word. Wow.

1449
01:34:35,070 --> 01:34:38,640
In two words. Fuck Ya. In a sentence.
Drop Your Pants Ladies and gentlemen,

1450
01:34:38,641 --> 01:34:43,410
and see her now. Okay. So
you, you have, you have,

1451
01:34:43,770 --> 01:34:48,660
uh, as it were, very good Yelp reviews.
Like if you are a restaurant, I'd be like,

1452
01:34:48,661 --> 01:34:52,950
damn, I need to go to that
restaurant. So what separates a,

1453
01:34:53,460 --> 01:34:58,070
let's just focus on female sex workers.
What separates a female sex

1454
01:34:58,070 --> 01:35:02,280
worker from a great female sex worker,
right? Because you're sort of the, the,

1455
01:35:02,281 --> 01:35:06,890
the Michael Jordan of your sport. So, and,
and you're allowed to say communication,

1456
01:35:06,891 --> 01:35:09,500
but it can't be your full answer. And
if you say communication, you can,

1457
01:35:09,930 --> 01:35:13,870
you have to give me very specific
examples of what makes you different. Yep.

1458
01:35:13,950 --> 01:35:17,700
Thank you. Deal with communication in this
particular case. Okay. All right. Well,

1459
01:35:17,710 --> 01:35:21,180
I think the big differentiating
factor is passion.

1460
01:35:21,270 --> 01:35:22,920
That zest for life,

1461
01:35:22,980 --> 01:35:27,980
that inquisitive nature and desire
for more that lust overall for life,

1462
01:35:29,581 --> 01:35:32,040
not just necessarily for sex or money,

1463
01:35:32,310 --> 01:35:37,170
but rather that constant desire
and drive for what's next,

1464
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:38,220
what's more,

1465
01:35:38,221 --> 01:35:42,390
I'm passionate and I want to learn
and I want to explore and experience.

1466
01:35:42,660 --> 01:35:47,010
So I'd say being passionate about what I
do really is what separates me and kind

1467
01:35:47,011 --> 01:35:49,470
of puts me that head and
shoulders above everybody else.

1468
01:35:49,680 --> 01:35:54,600
I'm an incredibly vocal advocate
for sex workers, sex workers rights.

1469
01:35:54,810 --> 01:35:59,580
I'm an incredibly well educated
individual when it comes to sex,

1470
01:35:59,581 --> 01:36:02,160
sex needs, sex, intimacy.

1471
01:36:02,550 --> 01:36:06,960
And it's something that I really consider
myself to be not just an expert in,

1472
01:36:07,020 --> 01:36:09,810
but something that I'm truly
and genuinely passionate about.

1473
01:36:09,811 --> 01:36:14,811
It has such a great meaning and impact
on my life personally that it definitely

1474
01:36:16,411 --> 01:36:21,150
has left its thumbprint on the essence
of who I am because I've allowed it to

1475
01:36:21,151 --> 01:36:23,070
affect me on that deep personal level.

1476
01:36:23,100 --> 01:36:28,100
I'm also able to give of myself in a very
deep personal way that I think is kind

1477
01:36:28,321 --> 01:36:30,810
of rare in our society these days.

1478
01:36:30,940 --> 01:36:34,000
So give, give me an
example if you can. Uh,

1479
01:36:34,060 --> 01:36:36,160
because not to,

1480
01:36:36,220 --> 01:36:40,900
not to really beat the Michael
Jordan an analogy to death,

1481
01:36:40,901 --> 01:36:43,060
but it's like, all right,
Michael Jordan clearly had,

1482
01:36:43,420 --> 01:36:48,420
actually I heard an anecdote from one of
the mental performance coaches for the

1483
01:36:50,291 --> 01:36:53,990
bowls at the time who I think previously
had worked with the Lakers on a

1484
01:36:54,010 --> 01:36:56,810
meditative and mindfulness
practices who said that, you know,

1485
01:36:56,811 --> 01:37:01,811
Jordan was perhaps the only player who
reflected the skills he was trying to

1486
01:37:03,191 --> 01:37:05,300
impart to the other.
So, okay. But you were,

1487
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:10,320
so you have say his ability to generate
this being in the zone at well or

1488
01:37:12,191 --> 01:37:15,370
something like that. But then you
have, you have Jordan as a brilliant,

1489
01:37:16,370 --> 01:37:21,070
a technician and tactician and so on.
So the PA I will,

1490
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:25,120
I'm interested in digging into the
passion, but I need some examples.

1491
01:37:25,150 --> 01:37:28,150
Like how does that translate
to an experience for someone?

1492
01:37:30,020 --> 01:37:32,720
Hmm. Trying to think of the
best way to verbalize that.

1493
01:37:33,710 --> 01:37:38,710
I would say the easiest way to kind of
encapsulate what you're talking about is

1494
01:37:40,821 --> 01:37:45,821
to go back and reference something
that I'm very interested in,

1495
01:37:46,101 --> 01:37:51,020
which is the 48 laws of power.
It's really phenomenal book.

1496
01:37:51,170 --> 01:37:55,030
Really, really interesting. Yes.

1497
01:37:55,350 --> 01:38:00,350
Speaks quite a lot about the
mental capacity is of somebody,

1498
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:04,020
how we view and interact
with the world around us.

1499
01:38:04,021 --> 01:38:08,850
There's a certain level of mindfulness
that that book preaches to be cognisant

1500
01:38:08,851 --> 01:38:09,720
of your decisions,

1501
01:38:09,721 --> 01:38:14,721
where you're making your decisions rather
than letting yourself react to what's

1502
01:38:15,031 --> 01:38:16,320
happening around you.

1503
01:38:16,680 --> 01:38:20,250
So I guess one of the things that also
makes me different is that level of

1504
01:38:20,251 --> 01:38:23,730
mindfulness.
I always take that extra step.

1505
01:38:23,731 --> 01:38:27,870
I always do just a little bit more than
everybody else would if it's somebody's

1506
01:38:27,900 --> 01:38:31,860
birthday. And they told me that in
passing they enjoy chocolate cake. Well,

1507
01:38:31,861 --> 01:38:35,790
I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to
bake them a chocolate cake and then I'm

1508
01:38:35,791 --> 01:38:38,340
also going to go ahead
and get candles for it.

1509
01:38:38,520 --> 01:38:42,750
And then I'm also going to reference back
and find out what sort of interest in

1510
01:38:42,751 --> 01:38:46,620
hobbies they haven't get them a
birthday present and a birthday card.

1511
01:38:48,150 --> 01:38:51,390
I always like to take
things to that next level,

1512
01:38:51,391 --> 01:38:56,130
that next intensity,
whether it be from simply doing,

1513
01:38:57,120 --> 01:39:01,920
say my website and just
blogging casually. Oh, no.

1514
01:39:01,921 --> 01:39:05,280
I'm very, very careful and very
specific in the way that I blog.

1515
01:39:05,430 --> 01:39:09,810
I try and communicate my point
in my viewpoint, within my words.

1516
01:39:09,811 --> 01:39:14,811
I really tried to emphasize my beliefs
and place an importance on that

1517
01:39:16,770 --> 01:39:21,030
connectivity and that interaction
that we get to share. It's,

1518
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:26,120
it really is the encapsulating part of
the experience for me is being willing to

1519
01:39:28,831 --> 01:39:33,831
take the time and the effort to do a
little bit more than most when most people

1520
01:39:34,711 --> 01:39:39,510
would stop working. That's where I keep
going. I pushed just a little bit harder,

1521
01:39:39,750 --> 01:39:43,650
whether that be through marketing, whether
that be through clients interaction,

1522
01:39:43,950 --> 01:39:48,950
whether that be through how I
choose to present myself online.

1523
01:39:49,980 --> 01:39:53,610
All of those things is just a
little bit more, a little bit extra,

1524
01:39:53,611 --> 01:39:58,611
just really demonstrating that I
want to be known for this field.

1525
01:40:00,121 --> 01:40:05,121
I want to be known for creating these
incredible experiences for people and I

1526
01:40:05,281 --> 01:40:09,810
want people to have those encounters and
have those experiences and think about

1527
01:40:09,811 --> 01:40:11,910
them as a potential for their own life,

1528
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:13,330
so.
All right.

1529
01:40:13,330 --> 01:40:18,100
Let's talk about then
something you mentioned is on
the bucket list for a lot of

1530
01:40:18,101 --> 01:40:21,400
Ben and that is a threesome.

1531
01:40:21,450 --> 01:40:26,450
Say if you are working with say a one
of your female friends and who is also a

1532
01:40:28,721 --> 01:40:32,860
sex worker and providing
that experience for men,

1533
01:40:33,130 --> 01:40:38,130
what are some of the ways that you
guys would go above and beyond in that

1534
01:40:38,470 --> 01:40:41,640
experience and and specifically like I'm,

1535
01:40:41,650 --> 01:40:45,670
I'm curious about maybe
some of the technical stuff,
some of the acts themselves,

1536
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:46,480
uh,

1537
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:51,480
things that may not be obvious
or things that may be unexpected.

1538
01:40:52,120 --> 01:40:56,470
Anything really that that is that unfolds.

1539
01:40:57,490 --> 01:41:00,010
What are some of the, what, what
is, what's the secret sauce?

1540
01:41:00,011 --> 01:41:01,480
What are some of the magic ingredients

1541
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:08,000
when it comes to a threesome
encounter at the ultimate frosting?

1542
01:41:08,521 --> 01:41:13,521
Cherry on top of whipped cream dessert
of it all is honestly a two girl blow job

1543
01:41:16,921 --> 01:41:21,921
or where the two of us are kneeling
before a guy who was standing one position

1544
01:41:21,961 --> 01:41:23,580
on either side of his member,

1545
01:41:23,910 --> 01:41:28,680
both of our mouths and our hands on his
body looking up at him and pleasuring

1546
01:41:28,681 --> 01:41:33,060
him where he truly is the center
of our world. For that moment.

1547
01:41:33,870 --> 01:41:38,730
I have had guides rant and rave about
that kind of experience more so than

1548
01:41:38,731 --> 01:41:43,731
anything else when it comes to a threesome
cause just being able to feel like,

1549
01:41:43,771 --> 01:41:44,221
wow,

1550
01:41:44,221 --> 01:41:48,030
I am the center of someone's
sexual attention in the
center of someone's Sexual

1551
01:41:48,031 --> 01:41:50,130
Universe is hot.

1552
01:41:50,940 --> 01:41:54,530
Oh sure. Yeah. No, that's I am.

1553
01:41:54,930 --> 01:41:57,480
I am not confused or surprised.

1554
01:41:57,510 --> 01:42:02,510
The the related question I suppose for
people out there who are interested in

1555
01:42:04,830 --> 01:42:07,170
becoming better at giving blowjobs,
right,

1556
01:42:07,171 --> 01:42:10,660
what recommendations
would you have for them?

1557
01:42:10,661 --> 01:42:14,280
Are there any do's or
do nots common mistakes?

1558
01:42:14,940 --> 01:42:18,490
Anything that you can suggest
to enhance the experience? What?

1559
01:42:18,491 --> 01:42:21,540
What are your thoughts?
If you were teaching a class,

1560
01:42:21,541 --> 01:42:22,860
maybe you have taught a class on this,
right?

1561
01:42:23,120 --> 01:42:26,510
I haven't backed out this class on
how to give the better blow job.

1562
01:42:26,511 --> 01:42:27,344
It's a fun one.
Yeah.

1563
01:42:27,370 --> 01:42:29,270
All right, so what are,
what are some of the,

1564
01:42:30,110 --> 01:42:32,570
what are some of the key teachings?

1565
01:42:34,260 --> 01:42:38,340
The first thing you need to do is look
at what your general blow job routine is.

1566
01:42:38,341 --> 01:42:40,950
Are you doing the same
things over and over again?

1567
01:42:41,160 --> 01:42:44,880
Are you focusing on the head or
a particular part of the penis?

1568
01:42:44,881 --> 01:42:48,930
Are you making eye contact?
What are you doing right now?

1569
01:42:49,170 --> 01:42:50,880
Whatever it is that
you're doing right now,

1570
01:42:50,940 --> 01:42:55,290
the next step is to go ahead and add to
it, so if you're just a standard vo job,

1571
01:42:55,350 --> 01:42:58,050
focusing all the pause for a moment,

1572
01:42:58,320 --> 01:43:03,270
look up and make really direct eye contact
with your partner and then keep going

1573
01:43:03,271 --> 01:43:05,340
while keeping that eye contact maintained.

1574
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:08,820
It's going to change the energy
and change the interaction.

1575
01:43:09,090 --> 01:43:13,470
Then you can take it the next step further
and start playing with perhaps food.

1576
01:43:14,130 --> 01:43:18,270
Have you ever taken whipped cream and
put whipped cream on top of your man and

1577
01:43:18,271 --> 01:43:20,490
then had whipped cream off of his member?

1578
01:43:20,640 --> 01:43:23,670
That can be an incredibly
erotic way to do things.

1579
01:43:23,910 --> 01:43:28,350
Not to mention the fact that in a
technical term, by placing a food object,

1580
01:43:28,650 --> 01:43:30,090
it kind of gives you your mouth,

1581
01:43:30,091 --> 01:43:34,620
a taste guide for what parts of the body
you have and have not paid attention to

1582
01:43:34,650 --> 01:43:35,160
get.

1583
01:43:35,160 --> 01:43:39,570
It really creates this moment where you
have to slow down and you have to make

1584
01:43:39,571 --> 01:43:41,940
sure you clean up all
the whipped cream in.

1585
01:43:41,941 --> 01:43:46,941
It's a really pleasurable way to slow
things down and enjoy the moment and enjoy

1586
01:43:47,641 --> 01:43:51,590
the action. So it's about being willing
to try new things in your blowjob.

1587
01:43:51,950 --> 01:43:54,100
And of course ladies watched the teeth.

1588
01:43:56,510 --> 01:43:59,750
Yes. Watch the teeth. That'd
be a good bumper sticker.

1589
01:43:59,751 --> 01:44:04,751
It said the good message to impart a hand.

1590
01:44:05,510 --> 01:44:10,510
No hand if if hand involved
just fingers full hand.

1591
01:44:11,721 --> 01:44:14,870
I mean I guess your forefoot eights or
maybe if the time you may probably have

1592
01:44:14,871 --> 01:44:18,680
tiny hands. So I'm not sure. It must
have, they must make guys feel amazing.

1593
01:44:18,710 --> 01:44:19,820
They were like,
oh my God,

1594
01:44:20,780 --> 01:44:24,820
is my cock really huge or her hands
just really small. I don't care.

1595
01:44:24,821 --> 01:44:29,660
It's so amazing. Oh God.
Yeah. Uh, so yeah. So,

1596
01:44:29,661 --> 01:44:31,310
so what are your,
what are your thoughts on hand?

1597
01:44:32,330 --> 01:44:36,740
You Comfortable Cup them. Massage
them between my hands. Not to roughly.

1598
01:44:36,741 --> 01:44:40,970
You really don't want to pull on
them or put serious pressure on them.

1599
01:44:40,971 --> 01:44:44,300
But just having that added
sensation there for a lot of guys.

1600
01:44:44,301 --> 01:44:47,270
Can actually make their orgasms
significantly more intense.

1601
01:44:47,460 --> 01:44:51,290
Hmm. So wait, now you're talking
about like one hand is cupping,

1602
01:44:51,291 --> 01:44:53,300
like you're holding a baby
bird or something like that?

1603
01:44:54,440 --> 01:44:58,320
Yes, kind of as if you had
two eggs sitting in the
center of your hand and then

1604
01:44:58,321 --> 01:45:03,240
you're kind of spinning those two eggs
back and forth against each other,

1605
01:45:03,241 --> 01:45:06,270
kind of sliding them against each other.
We're sliding them against her hand,

1606
01:45:06,480 --> 01:45:09,930
kind of providing a light
tactile stimulation.

1607
01:45:10,170 --> 01:45:13,360
Got It. And then what are you doing
with the other hand or what might you,

1608
01:45:13,820 --> 01:45:18,820
I enjoy the sensation of feeling deep
inside a woman and how they tend to

1609
01:45:20,711 --> 01:45:21,580
perceive this.

1610
01:45:21,581 --> 01:45:24,310
And a lot of guys do this subconsciously
when they're masturbating,

1611
01:45:24,520 --> 01:45:28,870
whatever hand are not using their placing
on the the crook of their inner thigh

1612
01:45:29,050 --> 01:45:30,580
and they're placing pressure there.

1613
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:34,900
But that tree is for the
body is it transmits and
translates to the nerves that

1614
01:45:34,901 --> 01:45:37,870
makes them feel as if they are
deep inside of a woman's body.

1615
01:45:38,110 --> 01:45:42,820
So sometimes what I'll do is I'll place
my other hand that isn't on their balls.

1616
01:45:42,940 --> 01:45:47,110
I'll place it against their body,
against their shaft. At the very,

1617
01:45:47,111 --> 01:45:51,370
very base of it and kind of give that
pressure sensation as if they are deep

1618
01:45:51,371 --> 01:45:55,750
inside of a woman. That combined
with the pleasure I'm giving,

1619
01:45:55,751 --> 01:45:58,570
using my mouth and the pleasure
I'm giving, using my hand,

1620
01:45:58,720 --> 01:46:00,910
it can really create
a mind blowing orgasm.

1621
01:46:01,260 --> 01:46:02,093
Hmm.

1622
01:46:03,270 --> 01:46:07,890
Like if the guy, like if a guy normally
doesn't finish during a blow job,

1623
01:46:07,930 --> 01:46:11,990
a lot of guys find that they're not able
to by adding those two simple things,

1624
01:46:11,991 --> 01:46:15,800
it can completely change their mindset
on blow jobs and make it one of their

1625
01:46:15,801 --> 01:46:17,510
favorite ways to finish

1626
01:46:19,060 --> 01:46:20,950
what is,
all right.

1627
01:46:20,951 --> 01:46:25,951
So we're taught when I was mentioning
a five star Yelp reviews earlier.

1628
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:31,900
So in the context of a threesome
that you're in charge of, right?

1629
01:46:31,901 --> 01:46:35,140
You and another woman are
kind of running the show.

1630
01:46:35,141 --> 01:46:40,000
So you already talked about man
standing, two women on the floor. Uh,

1631
01:46:40,001 --> 01:46:42,100
if,
if you're looking at greatest hits,

1632
01:46:42,130 --> 01:46:45,940
like what gets the most
rave reviews for finishing?

1633
01:46:46,180 --> 01:46:50,070
What is the last,
what is the last five minutes look like?

1634
01:46:51,160 --> 01:46:52,360
The big K out.

1635
01:46:52,361 --> 01:46:57,361
So the big k o often looks like
the guy on his back myself.

1636
01:46:58,300 --> 01:47:00,550
On top in doggy style,

1637
01:47:00,820 --> 01:47:04,600
the other lady is reversed
where she's facing me,

1638
01:47:04,601 --> 01:47:09,370
but sitting on top of his face in such a
way that he's still able to see and her

1639
01:47:09,371 --> 01:47:14,050
and I are making out playing with these
Childers breasts and really getting into

1640
01:47:14,051 --> 01:47:16,720
the encounter.
I happened to be bisexual,

1641
01:47:16,721 --> 01:47:20,410
so I'm already head over heels
about everything that's happening.

1642
01:47:20,710 --> 01:47:25,480
And most of the ladies that I do too,
girl experiences with are also bisexual.

1643
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:28,960
So there's that energy of natural
chemistry between the two of Boston.

1644
01:47:28,961 --> 01:47:32,470
That attraction in addition
to the focus on his pleasure,

1645
01:47:32,710 --> 01:47:37,710
he is just so stimulating both visually
and then just in regards to how he's

1646
01:47:38,501 --> 01:47:42,700
feeling that a lot of guys come that
way and they come really, really hard.

1647
01:47:46,680 --> 01:47:47,520
Big K,

1648
01:47:47,950 --> 01:47:52,650
it's a lot of fun because if you have
never gotten to have sex like that,

1649
01:47:52,651 --> 01:47:54,060
you are missing out.

1650
01:47:57,250 --> 01:48:02,250
That is one of life's like life's eighth
wonder is a mind blowing threesome.

1651
01:48:03,490 --> 01:48:07,810
Oh No, no disagreement there. Agreed.
Agreed. Uh, yeah, that, that's,

1652
01:48:07,860 --> 01:48:10,840
that's unfortunate. There aren't more
threesomes in the world for sure.

1653
01:48:10,870 --> 01:48:14,920
The big chaos now just to really
hone in on the visual. So you are,

1654
01:48:15,610 --> 01:48:20,420
you are on top of the man mounted on
the man facing towards his head. You,

1655
01:48:20,421 --> 01:48:23,560
you had mentioned doggystyle, but you're
kind of in cowgirl, not really cowgirl.

1656
01:48:23,561 --> 01:48:27,580
I guess it's cowgirl only when you have
your knees up to your knees are down. Um,

1657
01:48:27,930 --> 01:48:30,030
Yep.
So it's still considered to be cow girl.

1658
01:48:30,031 --> 01:48:35,031
It's where I'm on top of him and my body
is upright rather than leaned or tipped

1659
01:48:35,351 --> 01:48:39,250
forward.
The other lady is facing me parallels.

1660
01:48:39,251 --> 01:48:40,900
So as we're looking at each other,

1661
01:48:40,901 --> 01:48:45,901
so she is facing him and she's sitting
on his face in such a way that he's able

1662
01:48:46,151 --> 01:48:48,070
to give her oral stimulation.

1663
01:48:48,310 --> 01:48:52,120
But then he's also able to see
everything that's going on.

1664
01:48:52,690 --> 01:48:56,680
Oftentimes we'll use the mirrors for this
if the angle is a little bit difficult.

1665
01:48:56,681 --> 01:49:01,030
A lot of our rooms already have them
installed to kind of give that visual

1666
01:49:01,031 --> 01:49:03,280
emphasis too,
not just the physical.

1667
01:49:05,110 --> 01:49:07,980
Sounds lovely. Uh, all right, fun.

1668
01:49:08,070 --> 01:49:12,310
I'm going to before I just get lost in
reverie. Uh, back to my interviewing.

1669
01:49:14,650 --> 01:49:17,350
I want to talk about the
negotiating again because um,

1670
01:49:17,410 --> 01:49:21,010
I'm very interested in this and I
know we touched on it very briefly,

1671
01:49:21,011 --> 01:49:25,810
but what types of points
are you negotiating?

1672
01:49:26,460 --> 01:49:28,420
Are you negotiating price or you know,

1673
01:49:28,421 --> 01:49:31,510
she like I loved it for you
to dig into the specifics,

1674
01:49:31,511 --> 01:49:35,920
like give some examples like what kind
of stuff is being agreed upon and settled

1675
01:49:35,921 --> 01:49:38,110
on in that,
in that conversation beforehand,

1676
01:49:39,330 --> 01:49:41,010
during the negotiation,

1677
01:49:41,250 --> 01:49:45,360
the very first thing that is
discussed is what we are doing,

1678
01:49:45,690 --> 01:49:47,440
where we're doing it,

1679
01:49:48,130 --> 01:49:52,960
what they desire to get out
of that experience and what
kind of a budget they're

1680
01:49:52,961 --> 01:49:55,150
working with. And at that point, yes,

1681
01:49:55,151 --> 01:49:58,780
we are definitely negotiating over price.
Of course,

1682
01:49:58,781 --> 01:50:03,160
some more flexible someone's budget is
the more in depth of an experience are

1683
01:50:03,161 --> 01:50:07,330
able to have. There definitely
is a correlation there
between those two things.

1684
01:50:07,750 --> 01:50:12,070
What's very interesting in our industry
is that there is nowhere else that we

1685
01:50:12,071 --> 01:50:17,071
can talk about price except at the
physical location of the brothel in our

1686
01:50:17,321 --> 01:50:18,100
bedrooms.

1687
01:50:18,100 --> 01:50:22,000
So this isn't something that can be
done in advanced online or over phone.

1688
01:50:22,210 --> 01:50:26,410
This system make that you actually have
to do in person due to how Nevada law is

1689
01:50:26,411 --> 01:50:30,040
written. There's no rates
posted online on my website.

1690
01:50:30,100 --> 01:50:32,320
None of that information
is anything we discussed.

1691
01:50:32,321 --> 01:50:37,321
So price is definitely one of the
things that we negotiate for it.

1692
01:50:37,600 --> 01:50:42,600
Of course it varies from person to
person and it's worth mentioning that the

1693
01:50:42,641 --> 01:50:47,080
ranch is built very discreetly so you
can feel comfortable using your debit or

1694
01:50:47,081 --> 01:50:51,160
credit card there because it
is a professional business
and not worry about that

1695
01:50:51,161 --> 01:50:52,120
being a concern.

1696
01:50:54,610 --> 01:50:58,910
Tax Consultation, uh, Sin City or

1697
01:51:00,610 --> 01:51:05,110
what is the descriptor? What shows up
on the statement? I'm so curious. Oh,

1698
01:51:05,111 --> 01:51:08,560
we actually usually don't publicize
that info. Okay. All right, that's fine.

1699
01:51:08,561 --> 01:51:13,120
That's fine. Gotcha. Oh, right,
right, right, right. I would
make thousands of enemies.

1700
01:51:13,150 --> 01:51:14,710
Sorry, sorry, I didn't,

1701
01:51:14,740 --> 01:51:17,950
I didn't really think that one through
all the like wives listening would be

1702
01:51:17,951 --> 01:51:22,930
like God immediately looking for all
of the things that might show up. Okay.

1703
01:51:23,230 --> 01:51:27,460
Got It. Got It. All right,
so Safeway, potato chips,

1704
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:31,900
a ranch. I think that's, that
would, that would be my code.

1705
01:51:33,450 --> 01:51:38,240
Alright. Uh, terrible. Oh my God. I
just said that out loud. Okay. So, uh,

1706
01:51:39,270 --> 01:51:42,220
all right, let's, let's keep
going. This, it's very discreet.

1707
01:51:44,370 --> 01:51:46,170
You'd definitely discuss price.

1708
01:51:46,590 --> 01:51:50,780
Some clients are very comfortable
talking about the intimate details of the

1709
01:51:50,781 --> 01:51:54,840
sexual experience that you want at
the client is interested in role play.

1710
01:51:54,841 --> 01:51:56,730
They may be very specific and say,

1711
01:51:56,970 --> 01:52:01,970
I want you to wear a red school girl
skirt with a white tight blouse top with

1712
01:52:03,931 --> 01:52:05,490
your heroin,
high pigtails.

1713
01:52:05,850 --> 01:52:10,650
It can be that specific or is
generic as I want to have sex.

1714
01:52:11,070 --> 01:52:14,550
If they're a male virgin and they're not
comfortable talking about sex at that

1715
01:52:14,551 --> 01:52:18,810
point. And so each person's negotiation
is going to go a little bit differently.

1716
01:52:19,110 --> 01:52:23,010
But generally speaking, I like to
cover the, where we want to go,

1717
01:52:23,011 --> 01:52:24,750
what we want to do.

1718
01:52:24,810 --> 01:52:28,320
Do they have a specific end goal in mind
or something that they really want to

1719
01:52:28,321 --> 01:52:32,010
experience and then I kind of
custom tailor and explain to them,

1720
01:52:32,190 --> 01:52:34,650
well based off of what you've told me,

1721
01:52:35,010 --> 01:52:38,310
I think the best encounter for
you is going to look like this.

1722
01:52:38,550 --> 01:52:40,890
Generally speaking,
we'll want to spend,

1723
01:52:40,891 --> 01:52:44,040
you know an afternoon together and this
is kind of what we're looking at but

1724
01:52:44,430 --> 01:52:47,600
price wise and then we just
kind of take it from there.

1725
01:52:48,380 --> 01:52:52,380
Either they're able to do that and we're
good to go and this is where it's a

1726
01:52:52,381 --> 01:52:55,820
negotiation because we can go,
oh I can't quite get there.

1727
01:52:55,850 --> 01:52:58,350
What if we take this activity away?

1728
01:52:58,430 --> 01:53:02,030
Can we still have plenty of time for
everything else we can have? Great,

1729
01:53:02,031 --> 01:53:03,010
let's focus on that.

1730
01:53:03,250 --> 01:53:07,180
What if I don't get the power windows
and I don't need the fancy rims?

1731
01:53:08,020 --> 01:53:12,670
Then where do we end up? What is the
range? If you're, if you're able to say,

1732
01:53:12,671 --> 01:53:14,800
I mean on kind of low end,

1733
01:53:14,860 --> 01:53:19,860
if we're going a lean
machine up to like the works,

1734
01:53:20,750 --> 01:53:23,620
what's like the, the, the full
Cadillac, I mean is there,

1735
01:53:23,650 --> 01:53:26,530
is it possible to give a
range on something like that?

1736
01:53:27,750 --> 01:53:28,583
Sure thing.

1737
01:53:28,710 --> 01:53:31,920
Of course it's going to vary from lady
to lady because we're all independent

1738
01:53:31,921 --> 01:53:33,900
contractors,
but a very,

1739
01:53:33,960 --> 01:53:38,220
very general range or a way
to framework it would be um,

1740
01:53:38,221 --> 01:53:42,720
a very brief encounter could be
in the three figure brain range.

1741
01:53:42,750 --> 01:53:45,600
Something a little bit more in depth,

1742
01:53:45,601 --> 01:53:49,950
like going out to dinner would be
somewhere in the four figure range and if

1743
01:53:49,951 --> 01:53:53,670
somebody chooses to spend a night
or a multiple of these with me,

1744
01:53:53,850 --> 01:53:55,350
then we can certainly approach that.

1745
01:53:55,360 --> 01:53:58,830
I figure range there been gentleman
who have stayed at the ranch,

1746
01:53:58,831 --> 01:54:02,730
have even spent in the six to seven figure
range because that just happens to be

1747
01:54:02,731 --> 01:54:07,530
what they're working budget is because
we see such a wide variety of clients,

1748
01:54:07,770 --> 01:54:11,100
someone's disposable income
is completely varied.

1749
01:54:11,130 --> 01:54:15,810
Somebody may be coming in and wanting to
spend an entire week with a lady versus

1750
01:54:15,811 --> 01:54:19,890
somebody coming in that really is just
looking to have a really amazing massage

1751
01:54:19,891 --> 01:54:20,790
and happy ending.

1752
01:54:21,210 --> 01:54:26,210
There absolutely is no wrong request and
there certainly isn't a write request.

1753
01:54:26,431 --> 01:54:31,380
It's whatever works for you for your
budget and just being willing to have a

1754
01:54:31,381 --> 01:54:34,590
conversation about, hey, you know, if
this is what I kind of had in mind,

1755
01:54:34,591 --> 01:54:36,000
this is what I'm interested in,

1756
01:54:36,270 --> 01:54:40,230
what can we make happen if someone
comes into my room with that attitude,

1757
01:54:40,231 --> 01:54:42,450
I have no doubt we'll be
able to make something work.

1758
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:43,393
Okay,

1759
01:54:43,810 --> 01:54:48,080
so I'm just listening to some of
these numbers on the high end debt.

1760
01:54:48,090 --> 01:54:51,860
Is Dennis Hoff still the proprietor
as he's still the owner or is it

1761
01:54:52,180 --> 01:54:53,013
yes.
Yes.

1762
01:54:53,140 --> 01:54:55,210
Okay. So Dennis is my, as I understand,

1763
01:54:55,211 --> 01:55:00,211
it was a frequent customer who purchased
the business in 1993 for $700,000 then

1764
01:55:01,361 --> 01:55:06,010
he invested I think another half
million in upgrades and improvements.

1765
01:55:06,011 --> 01:55:06,940
So that means,

1766
01:55:06,970 --> 01:55:09,640
and I don't know what the split is
between the ladies in the house,

1767
01:55:09,641 --> 01:55:11,950
so we can get into that
or not get into that,

1768
01:55:11,980 --> 01:55:16,450
but it would seem like with
one high roller who comes in,

1769
01:55:17,020 --> 01:55:21,790
he could have recouped his
entire investment or at
least the two trenches that I

1770
01:55:21,791 --> 01:55:23,860
mentioned in the business.
That's pretty amazing.

1771
01:55:23,920 --> 01:55:27,490
I mean if that is actually the case,
I have no idea how the economics work,

1772
01:55:27,491 --> 01:55:31,650
but it seems like it seems like a very,
a self sustaining,

1773
01:55:32,500 --> 01:55:36,070
a attractive economic model I guess.

1774
01:55:36,071 --> 01:55:40,540
I mean it particularly if you have some
of these folks flying in from God knows

1775
01:55:40,541 --> 01:55:44,070
where and they're dropping six or seven
figures. I mean that's got to cover a

1776
01:55:44,070 --> 01:55:46,470
lot of incidentals.

1777
01:55:47,780 --> 01:55:49,430
Oh,
it absolutely does that.

1778
01:55:49,431 --> 01:55:54,050
Dennis is gone and he has expanded
beyond just the bunny ranch as of this

1779
01:55:54,051 --> 01:55:57,380
moment.
He owns seven different brothels.

1780
01:55:58,010 --> 01:56:02,930
We have up in the northern half of the
state, we have the moonlight bunny ranch,

1781
01:56:03,230 --> 01:56:05,330
the love ranch north,

1782
01:56:05,540 --> 01:56:10,540
the kit Kat ranch and the sage
brush ranch down south near Vegas.

1783
01:56:10,881 --> 01:56:14,120
We have the alien cat
house and love ranch south.

1784
01:56:14,240 --> 01:56:15,890
So just to give you an idea,

1785
01:56:16,190 --> 01:56:21,140
this is somebody that definitely
found his industry, embraced it,

1786
01:56:21,170 --> 01:56:22,070
ran with it,

1787
01:56:22,071 --> 01:56:25,310
and it's created a tremendous opportunity
for the women that work at these

1788
01:56:25,311 --> 01:56:29,810
locations to kind of build their own
business within a business and a brand

1789
01:56:29,811 --> 01:56:30,710
within a brand.

1790
01:56:30,890 --> 01:56:33,550
So net you mentioned like alien,
what was it?

1791
01:56:33,620 --> 01:56:38,290
Alien Cat Ranch and uh, alien
cat house. Oh, so close. Yeah.

1792
01:56:38,620 --> 01:56:42,790
How sounds a lot better than cat ranch.
And are these,

1793
01:56:43,720 --> 01:56:46,210
are these different genres?

1794
01:56:46,250 --> 01:56:49,720
Are they different types of food
so to speak? It's kind of like, Oh,

1795
01:56:49,721 --> 01:56:52,720
if you want Italian, go here. If you want
Thai food, go here. If you want this,

1796
01:56:52,721 --> 01:56:56,140
go there.
Or is each of or each of those,

1797
01:56:57,220 --> 01:57:01,010
uh, sort of buffet choose
your own adventure of there?

1798
01:57:01,240 --> 01:57:05,230
There's everything here or do each of
them have a particular kind of personality

1799
01:57:05,231 --> 01:57:06,064
and style?

1800
01:57:07,040 --> 01:57:11,120
I think that each location definitely
has a unique energy to that location.

1801
01:57:11,390 --> 01:57:14,540
However, it's not like all
blondes go to the bunny ranch.

1802
01:57:14,541 --> 01:57:17,480
Nell brunettes go to love
ranch at each location.

1803
01:57:17,481 --> 01:57:21,440
You're going to find a variety of
women in all ages, shapes and sizes.

1804
01:57:21,710 --> 01:57:26,390
And so really there's not a wrong
place to go. As far as facilities go,

1805
01:57:26,510 --> 01:57:29,090
we're able to travel between
the different ranches.

1806
01:57:29,210 --> 01:57:33,410
So if somebody at Kit Kat ranches say
interested in having a threesome with

1807
01:57:33,411 --> 01:57:37,700
myself and Hannah Fox who works
over at the Kit Kat ranch,

1808
01:57:38,330 --> 01:57:41,600
Hannah would be able to come up to the
bunny ranch in and joined myself in a

1809
01:57:41,601 --> 01:57:43,490
client or in reverse,

1810
01:57:43,491 --> 01:57:47,510
I'd be able to travel to the kit Kat
ranch and join her own her client.

1811
01:57:47,660 --> 01:57:51,140
They're all within about three minutes
of each other. So this is very,

1812
01:57:51,141 --> 01:57:53,750
very close by as far
as the northern houses,

1813
01:57:54,140 --> 01:57:58,640
which is really fun because when you
think about it, it literally is a buffet.

1814
01:57:58,641 --> 01:58:03,641
There's 151 flavors and inevitably there's
gonna be somebody that is the perfect

1815
01:58:05,451 --> 01:58:06,630
match for you.

1816
01:58:07,110 --> 01:58:08,570
So I have,

1817
01:58:08,630 --> 01:58:13,630
I have friends who are say travel writers
and this is going somewhere and they

1818
01:58:14,901 --> 01:58:19,850
find it difficult to travel for pleasure
because as soon as they start traveling,

1819
01:58:20,420 --> 01:58:23,930
their mind clicks into work mode
and they think about the story,

1820
01:58:23,931 --> 01:58:27,580
they could tell the detail they
could write down and so on. Uh,

1821
01:58:27,950 --> 01:58:30,990
I suppose what I'm wondering is,
uh,

1822
01:58:31,370 --> 01:58:36,170
after exploring this and pursuing it
and dedicating yourself to this as a

1823
01:58:36,171 --> 01:58:41,090
profession, what are the things
that still turn you on the most?

1824
01:58:41,110 --> 01:58:46,110
Like what are the things
that you're hoping will get
requested or does that make

1825
01:58:47,831 --> 01:58:50,770
any sense? It's like a, in a given
week are like, God, you know,

1826
01:58:50,830 --> 01:58:55,730
it would really make my week if somebody
asked for this, this or this is,

1827
01:58:55,731 --> 01:58:58,420
is there anything that would fall,

1828
01:58:59,160 --> 01:59:02,110
we would come up in your mind?
Um,

1829
01:59:02,320 --> 01:59:03,153
oh one

1830
01:59:04,280 --> 01:59:09,280
I really like working with gentlemen
who are a little bit older in age.

1831
01:59:09,740 --> 01:59:13,730
The reason for this is that they
already know how to treat a lady, right?

1832
01:59:13,820 --> 01:59:18,800
They're oftentimes very familiar with
sex and they're looking for so much more

1833
01:59:18,801 --> 01:59:21,980
than just that casual,
quickie and counter.

1834
01:59:22,340 --> 01:59:27,340
They want to take things to that next
level of connection and intimacy.

1835
01:59:28,250 --> 01:59:33,250
And I really find that my guests who are
in their forties fifties sixties in up,

1836
01:59:34,580 --> 01:59:38,240
they tend to have a certain
maturity that I find incredibly,

1837
01:59:38,241 --> 01:59:39,800
incredibly attractive.

1838
01:59:40,320 --> 01:59:45,100
Oh, Holy Shit. I just turned 40
I'm now an older gentlemen. Oh Wow.

1839
01:59:45,130 --> 01:59:48,830
I'm not sure if, I guess sounds
like a good thing I guess. Uh Huh.

1840
01:59:49,090 --> 01:59:52,780
I like to think of it as,
rather than being older, it's,

1841
01:59:53,450 --> 01:59:58,450
it's being experienced where at a certain
point you develop an appreciation for

1842
01:59:59,081 --> 01:59:59,441
women.

1843
01:59:59,441 --> 02:00:03,250
And I think for men that sometimes can
take a little bit longer and sometimes

1844
02:00:03,270 --> 02:00:07,720
doesn't quite click into place until
they reach a certain emotional maturity

1845
02:00:07,721 --> 02:00:11,350
where they're able to look at the
woman is more than just a sex object.

1846
02:00:11,351 --> 02:00:16,351
But as being these incredibly
intelligent and interesting beings,

1847
02:00:16,930 --> 02:00:21,930
a lot of guys struggle to see women as
more than just sex objects for a number

1848
02:00:23,350 --> 02:00:26,680
of years. And so sometimes it can take a
little bit longer for guys to reach that

1849
02:00:26,681 --> 02:00:27,341
threshold.

1850
02:00:27,341 --> 02:00:32,341
And honestly at that certain point to a
lot of those older gentlemen expressed

1851
02:00:34,331 --> 02:00:35,200
to me, Oh, you know,

1852
02:00:35,201 --> 02:00:39,820
I just don't feel comfortable having sex
with people my own age because I want

1853
02:00:39,821 --> 02:00:40,750
somebody who's younger.

1854
02:00:40,751 --> 02:00:45,280
I want somebody who's a little bit more
vicious and energetic and maybe they

1855
02:00:45,281 --> 02:00:49,090
have a little bit of a
harder time finishing and so
they're looking for somebody

1856
02:00:49,091 --> 02:00:53,380
who has the energy and stamina to really
work with them and try exciting new

1857
02:00:53,381 --> 02:00:57,700
things and I really enjoy
that interaction, that end.

1858
02:00:57,701 --> 02:01:00,430
I'd say adults, virgin as well, really,

1859
02:01:00,431 --> 02:01:03,220
really fulfilling to me to
spend time with those people.

1860
02:01:04,610 --> 02:01:05,443
What,

1861
02:01:06,800 --> 02:01:11,150
what was the experience like telling
your family about your decision to pursue

1862
02:01:11,151 --> 02:01:11,780
this work?

1863
02:01:11,780 --> 02:01:16,780
Can you walk us through that
conversation or that day?

1864
02:01:16,850 --> 02:01:17,900
What did that look like?

1865
02:01:19,350 --> 02:01:20,910
Oh goodness.
Well,

1866
02:01:20,911 --> 02:01:24,930
I definitely could have done
that a lot better than I did.

1867
02:01:25,140 --> 02:01:27,800
I decided that much like a bandaid.

1868
02:01:27,810 --> 02:01:31,910
I was just going to pull it
off and just be like, hi,

1869
02:01:31,911 --> 02:01:35,370
I'm a sex worker. I am going to work
at the Moonlight Bunny ranch and no,

1870
02:01:35,371 --> 02:01:37,260
you can not change my mind.

1871
02:01:37,770 --> 02:01:42,500
And I pretty much set it about that
directly and just very confidently said,

1872
02:01:43,040 --> 02:01:48,040
this is where I want to go and this is
the next step for me and if you want to

1873
02:01:50,121 --> 02:01:54,200
judge me for that you can go ahead but
you're not going to change my mind.

1874
02:01:54,530 --> 02:01:58,700
I had already made up my mind at that
point and nothing under the sun was going

1875
02:01:58,701 --> 02:01:59,660
to change it.

1876
02:02:00,550 --> 02:02:02,830
It was at the time,
not to interrupt,

1877
02:02:02,980 --> 02:02:06,880
but like what did your parents think
you were doing at the time before that

1878
02:02:07,240 --> 02:02:08,073
announcement?

1879
02:02:09,660 --> 02:02:14,550
Well at that moment I was actually
working as a massage therapist and I was

1880
02:02:14,551 --> 02:02:18,600
getting ready to move out of the state
for a couple of weeks just to try the job

1881
02:02:18,601 --> 02:02:19,740
and make sure I liked it.

1882
02:02:19,741 --> 02:02:24,690
And so the first piece of news was I was
leaving for two weeks and here is why.

1883
02:02:25,290 --> 02:02:30,290
And I decided in all of my stubborn
wisdom that I was going to inform them of

1884
02:02:31,981 --> 02:02:36,981
this the day before I was scheduled to
travel out to Nevada for the first time.

1885
02:02:38,520 --> 02:02:43,110
So I definitely should have gone ahead
and given them a little bit more notice.

1886
02:02:43,410 --> 02:02:44,490
But at the same time though,

1887
02:02:44,491 --> 02:02:49,491
I was going into it with almost this armor
meant around myself for I'm expecting

1888
02:02:50,431 --> 02:02:54,720
to overcome objections and I'm expecting
to have to explain and go into like

1889
02:02:54,721 --> 02:02:58,500
this whole presentation
about what sex in Nevada is,

1890
02:02:59,160 --> 02:03:03,900
and the response I got back was
pretty much, Oh, okay sweetie.

1891
02:03:03,901 --> 02:03:07,020
If that's what you want to do, are you
sure that's something you want to do?

1892
02:03:07,021 --> 02:03:11,610
Is it safe? Are you going to be safe?
You are okay, you can go do that.

1893
02:03:12,060 --> 02:03:16,560
Oh, okay. Then that was a much
better reaction than I expected.

1894
02:03:16,700 --> 02:03:19,850
Did you call a family
meeting or what was the,

1895
02:03:20,300 --> 02:03:23,300
did you go out to the olive
garden? I mean, what was the,

1896
02:03:23,360 --> 02:03:26,960
what was the setting for this? Right. Like
keep key pass the breadsticks and, oh,

1897
02:03:26,961 --> 02:03:31,870
by the way, I mean, what does breadsticks
and sex works? They pair together.

1898
02:03:32,420 --> 02:03:36,710
Yeah. So what, what was the setting, I
mean, how did you, how did you tee it up?

1899
02:03:38,110 --> 02:03:40,950
I'm just at home what?
We were in the living room.

1900
02:03:40,951 --> 02:03:45,480
I have a younger sibling who
isn't of the legal age of consent,

1901
02:03:45,481 --> 02:03:49,200
and so of course they're not
aware of what I do professionally.

1902
02:03:49,350 --> 02:03:52,950
So I went ahead and specifically
pulled my mother aside and had that

1903
02:03:52,951 --> 02:03:55,440
conversation with her
privately in the living room.

1904
02:03:56,530 --> 02:03:56,930
Yeah.

1905
02:03:56,930 --> 02:03:59,030
And was she watching TV where you're like,
hey,

1906
02:03:59,031 --> 02:04:04,031
let's just DVR what you're watching
or was she doing a crossword puzzle?

1907
02:04:04,671 --> 02:04:06,720
I just,
I liked trying,

1908
02:04:08,860 --> 02:04:13,060
at the time she was just hanging out
in the arm chair reading the magazine.

1909
02:04:13,300 --> 02:04:16,020
I sat down next to her and said, you
know, I want to tell you something.

1910
02:04:16,030 --> 02:04:19,810
She put the magazine down and I
just kind of blurt it all out there.

1911
02:04:19,900 --> 02:04:22,510
So I'm going to be illegal sex worker
and I'm going to go work in Nevada.

1912
02:04:22,511 --> 02:04:23,230
And I just,

1913
02:04:23,230 --> 02:04:28,230
a cascade of information kind of came
tumbling out of my mouth as I'm trying to

1914
02:04:29,320 --> 02:04:30,790
explain things.

1915
02:04:30,791 --> 02:04:34,660
And my mom's face is completely
unfazed at this point,

1916
02:04:34,661 --> 02:04:38,220
which I have to say Bravo to her for that.

1917
02:04:38,221 --> 02:04:43,221
I definitely didn't expect her to take
the news quite as well as she did and I

1918
02:04:43,801 --> 02:04:48,000
was very happily surprised that she
was just, Oh, okay. That's nice.

1919
02:04:48,090 --> 02:04:51,690
Another crazy adventure that you
want to go on. That's about normal.

1920
02:04:51,800 --> 02:04:55,550
How, how do you explain
that? I mean, did you just,

1921
02:04:56,180 --> 02:05:01,180
was your mom like a free wheeling free
thinking hippie back in the day or I mean

1922
02:05:03,020 --> 02:05:05,810
having come from Ireland,
I don't know the full background.

1923
02:05:05,811 --> 02:05:07,340
Is She from Ireland herself?

1924
02:05:08,280 --> 02:05:10,560
Yes,
she is extremely,

1925
02:05:10,561 --> 02:05:14,160
extremely on the more
conservative side of things,

1926
02:05:14,190 --> 02:05:18,120
which is one of the reasons why I
was expecting some of the objections

1927
02:05:20,040 --> 02:05:21,240
to the states.

1928
02:05:21,420 --> 02:05:25,290
She's kind of adapted a little bit
more of the liberal standpoints here in

1929
02:05:25,291 --> 02:05:28,080
Ireland,
especially in Northern Ireland right now,

1930
02:05:28,081 --> 02:05:31,500
and especially back then when we
lived over there in the country,

1931
02:05:31,680 --> 02:05:34,440
there is a very negative
stigma attached to sex work.

1932
02:05:34,570 --> 02:05:38,190
I had kind of done the research is what
sex work is like in other countries and

1933
02:05:38,191 --> 02:05:42,600
other places and what are the things I
came across is information about how sex

1934
02:05:42,601 --> 02:05:45,660
work exists in Ireland,
which it does not.

1935
02:05:46,320 --> 02:05:50,130
And I kind of, again, in that way,

1936
02:05:50,131 --> 02:05:51,870
but I tend to overthink things,

1937
02:05:52,200 --> 02:05:57,150
had this mental impression of what her
reaction would be and the way that she

1938
02:05:57,151 --> 02:05:59,670
looked at it, she's
like, Hey, you know what?

1939
02:05:59,700 --> 02:06:03,840
So long as you're not racing those
damn horses anymore and falling off and

1940
02:06:03,841 --> 02:06:08,400
breaking your arm, you're just going
to go have sex in Nevada. Cool.

1941
02:06:08,760 --> 02:06:12,660
That's not bad compared to some of the
crazy things that I have done with my

1942
02:06:12,661 --> 02:06:15,460
life.
It's very understanding.

1943
02:06:15,500 --> 02:06:19,770
Just kind of interesting when you
think about it from the sheer safety

1944
02:06:19,780 --> 02:06:20,613
standpoint,

1945
02:06:20,970 --> 02:06:24,960
being a jockey was certainly a riskier
profession than being illegal sex worker

1946
02:06:24,961 --> 02:06:29,100
in Nevada. My job is actually
incredibly, incredibly safe,

1947
02:06:29,280 --> 02:06:34,050
both because of how the location is set
up in addition to the legality and laws

1948
02:06:34,051 --> 02:06:35,340
that protect the ladies.

1949
02:06:36,720 --> 02:06:40,260
So let's, uh, let's, uh,
shift gears a bit now.

1950
02:06:40,290 --> 02:06:45,060
I'll ask just a handful of rapid fire
questions that I asked just about

1951
02:06:45,061 --> 02:06:47,160
everybody and,
uh,

1952
02:06:47,220 --> 02:06:51,640
we'll just spend a few
minutes going through four or
five of these and then, uh,

1953
02:06:52,140 --> 02:06:54,570
I will let you get back to your day.
This has been so much fun.

1954
02:06:54,571 --> 02:06:56,160
I could go for hours and hours and hours,
but the,

1955
02:06:56,700 --> 02:07:00,330
I was going to say, I am enjoying
this so much. I am having a blast.

1956
02:07:00,930 --> 02:07:05,800
No, this is, this is, uh, I'm
really glad we were able to
connect and I will, I will,

1957
02:07:05,860 --> 02:07:10,860
I will have already thanked the person
who made the mutual introduction in the

1958
02:07:11,160 --> 02:07:15,360
intro. But, uh, let's talk about
books because you collect books.

1959
02:07:16,260 --> 02:07:21,060
Uh, are there any books that you
have gifted the most to other people?

1960
02:07:21,600 --> 02:07:22,171
Are there,

1961
02:07:22,171 --> 02:07:27,171
are there any books that you have given
out more than once as gifts that come to

1962
02:07:27,901 --> 02:07:30,000
mind or that you would give as gifts?

1963
02:07:31,090 --> 02:07:35,170
Definitely. I would say the top three
books that I tend to give as gifts.

1964
02:07:35,500 --> 02:07:39,880
The first one would be a book that's
written by Dennis Hoff called the art of

1965
02:07:39,881 --> 02:07:43,240
the pen.
It literally talks about his journey.

1966
02:07:43,420 --> 02:07:46,930
How he ended up getting the Bunny ranch
in a lot of the intimate details in

1967
02:07:46,931 --> 02:07:51,310
relationship to sex in Nevada. For
anybody that's interested in what I do.

1968
02:07:51,311 --> 02:07:53,710
Wanting to learn a little
bit more about the industry.

1969
02:07:53,830 --> 02:07:58,830
That is always the first book I give is
this is kind of your handbook as it were

1970
02:07:59,390 --> 02:08:01,690
to the world of legal sex in Nevada.

1971
02:08:02,050 --> 02:08:05,980
The second book that I give out
most frequently is to my coworkers.

1972
02:08:06,160 --> 02:08:08,410
It would be the 48 laws of power.

1973
02:08:08,650 --> 02:08:12,640
A lot of the ladies haven't
had the opportunity or
haven't been exposed to that

1974
02:08:12,641 --> 02:08:13,270
book,

1975
02:08:13,270 --> 02:08:17,050
and so I think that it's a great tool
to get into the hands of women and get

1976
02:08:17,051 --> 02:08:20,110
that positive thinking,
going.

1977
02:08:20,110 --> 02:08:24,010
That energy that that book
really tends to encapsulate.

1978
02:08:24,810 --> 02:08:28,300
And the third book is kind
of an interesting one.

1979
02:08:28,660 --> 02:08:32,650
It's a book called memoirs of a Geisha.

1980
02:08:33,250 --> 02:08:38,250
It speaks as to the life of a woman who
ended up being a geisha in Japan during

1981
02:08:43,541 --> 02:08:48,541
the World War Two era who was kind of
purchased from her family and unwillingly

1982
02:08:49,660 --> 02:08:54,660
brought into this very foreign world
that could not be any more different than

1983
02:08:56,081 --> 02:08:57,490
what her life was.
The light.

1984
02:08:58,330 --> 02:09:02,650
The reason why I tend to recommend this
book for other people is that there's

1985
02:09:02,651 --> 02:09:07,651
this incredibly beautiful humanistic
element in the way that she describes the

1986
02:09:09,040 --> 02:09:12,520
author uses language that is very,

1987
02:09:12,521 --> 02:09:14,140
very rich and colorful,

1988
02:09:14,141 --> 02:09:19,141
and it sits you into that time and place
where you smell the fish in front of

1989
02:09:20,501 --> 02:09:24,310
you. You hear the sound of the
Shemy San that she's playing.

1990
02:09:24,311 --> 02:09:29,290
Like you can really immerse yourself into
that world and kind of get a sense of

1991
02:09:29,291 --> 02:09:31,420
what things were like at that time.

1992
02:09:33,190 --> 02:09:34,990
Yeah, it's a fan. Fantastic book.

1993
02:09:35,080 --> 02:09:40,020
And the author actually wrote the
entire book twice. Uh, he wrote the,

1994
02:09:40,270 --> 02:09:44,950
he wrote it first, was dissatisfied
with how it turned out, scrapped it,

1995
02:09:44,951 --> 02:09:48,790
and started over and wrote it
a second time, which is just

1996
02:09:51,040 --> 02:09:54,760
speaking as a writer's unimaginable.
I've thrown out showers,

1997
02:09:54,770 --> 02:09:59,740
know what the entire
novel, Oh my God. And uh,

1998
02:10:00,180 --> 02:10:01,450
yeah, it's, it's really,

1999
02:10:01,600 --> 02:10:06,600
it also sheds light on some of the
craft and art form related to being a

2000
02:10:07,010 --> 02:10:10,780
cortison during that period of time. And
I actually had the opportunity to go to,

2001
02:10:11,140 --> 02:10:14,140
to spend some time in,
I think it was cured or in Japan.

2002
02:10:14,141 --> 02:10:17,400
I spend a lot of time Japan and to uh,

2003
02:10:18,390 --> 02:10:20,350
to see a range,

2004
02:10:20,410 --> 02:10:24,760
a formal dinner with performances,

2005
02:10:25,030 --> 02:10:28,690
with a number of friends of mine
with two what they call gate goal.

2006
02:10:28,720 --> 02:10:33,660
So instead of Gay Shah, uh, it's,
they would call them gay cold Karl

2007
02:10:34,010 --> 02:10:37,970
with a k o at the end and at the
same idea, different dialect,

2008
02:10:38,240 --> 02:10:40,670
different label,
effectively no sex involved,

2009
02:10:41,030 --> 02:10:45,240
but came in and played the Shami Sen.
And uh,

2010
02:10:45,400 --> 02:10:50,400
I did a number of traditional
dance routines and prepared
t and went through all

2011
02:10:52,161 --> 02:10:56,240
of this ritual is very
beautiful experience, uh,

2012
02:10:57,050 --> 02:11:01,090
that, um, that are highly recommend if
people have the opportunity. So those,

2013
02:11:01,130 --> 02:11:04,870
those are those very diverse
set of three books. Uh,

2014
02:11:05,600 --> 02:11:06,860
next question is

2015
02:11:08,720 --> 02:11:12,380
a purchase of less than a hundred dollars
doesn't have to be less than a hundred

2016
02:11:12,380 --> 02:11:12,381
dollars.

2017
02:11:12,381 --> 02:11:17,381
It has most improved your life in
the last year or recent memory.

2018
02:11:17,810 --> 02:11:20,330
Any,
any purchase that has

2019
02:11:22,040 --> 02:11:23,960
improved your quality of
life that comes to mind?

2020
02:11:23,961 --> 02:11:27,950
Could be something that costs $5. It
could be something it's free actually, uh,

2021
02:11:27,951 --> 02:11:30,020
or anything sort of in that range.

2022
02:11:33,090 --> 02:11:35,800
Hmm.
That is a really interesting question.

2023
02:11:36,610 --> 02:11:41,260
I would have to say the leave it or not
and it seems like such a strange little

2024
02:11:41,261 --> 02:11:42,094
thing.

2025
02:11:42,820 --> 02:11:47,620
I like to cook for myself a lot and
I tend to eat very clean and healthy.

2026
02:11:47,621 --> 02:11:49,150
I enjoy a lot of vegetables.

2027
02:11:49,630 --> 02:11:54,630
The one contraption that I find myself
using time and time again as one of those

2028
02:11:54,971 --> 02:11:59,971
little spaghetti creations where you
insert the squash or Zucchini and you kind

2029
02:12:00,911 --> 02:12:05,860
of twist it and it turns it into a noodle
instead it makes the vegetable really

2030
02:12:05,861 --> 02:12:06,700
easy to cook.

2031
02:12:06,730 --> 02:12:11,470
It's great for meal prep and
given how hectic my work week is,

2032
02:12:11,680 --> 02:12:16,540
having that easy to use tool available
to me, it has made my life a lot easier.

2033
02:12:16,660 --> 02:12:21,280
So it's a, it's a vegetable spaghetti
maker effectively. So it'll,

2034
02:12:21,850 --> 02:12:22,150
it'll,

2035
02:12:22,150 --> 02:12:27,150
it'll push it through some type of press
to slice it into these thin strips.

2036
02:12:27,700 --> 02:12:28,533
Is that what it does?

2037
02:12:29,380 --> 02:12:33,700
Yes. And then if I had to
go slightly above $100,

2038
02:12:34,150 --> 02:12:39,150
I would have to say that my cordless
Hitachi has it been a gift from God.

2039
02:12:39,490 --> 02:12:43,750
Okay. The cordless Hitachi
magic wand, which has,

2040
02:12:43,880 --> 02:12:46,570
which has more setting has
a lot more settings. Yup.

2041
02:12:47,290 --> 02:12:52,150
And now you're not limited to
just being harnessed by this cord.

2042
02:12:52,210 --> 02:12:54,760
Now you have a lot more freedom
of movement with the toy.

2043
02:12:55,030 --> 02:13:00,030
And having that available within the
context of my job has been a ton of fun.

2044
02:13:01,301 --> 02:13:06,100
We have had so many great experiences
with it. It's been fantastic.

2045
02:13:08,430 --> 02:13:09,530
Alright.
Hitachi,

2046
02:13:10,610 --> 02:13:15,020
same thing I said to the fleshlight
first one's on me, call me.

2047
02:13:15,320 --> 02:13:20,180
We can figure out your official
sponsorship. Uh, right.
So the Hitachi cordless,

2048
02:13:21,170 --> 02:13:24,590
if you were to be given a billboard,

2049
02:13:25,050 --> 02:13:27,690
you could put anything on the billboard,
uh,

2050
02:13:28,110 --> 02:13:32,850
and metaphorically speaking to get a
message out to millions or billions of

2051
02:13:32,851 --> 02:13:36,330
people. So it could be a few words, could
be a single word, could be a paragraph,

2052
02:13:36,780 --> 02:13:38,070
it could be someone else's quote.

2053
02:13:38,670 --> 02:13:40,710
What would you put on it or
what might you put on it?

2054
02:13:42,770 --> 02:13:44,750
Well, the first part of
that would be as to where,

2055
02:13:44,751 --> 02:13:49,280
and I think that I would go ahead and
choose to put mine as close to the White

2056
02:13:49,280 --> 02:13:50,750
House as physically possible,

2057
02:13:50,751 --> 02:13:55,100
where people in legislature going to
have eyes on this thing as frequently as

2058
02:13:55,101 --> 02:13:59,000
possible. And my vest message
would be very, very simple.

2059
02:13:59,630 --> 02:14:02,510
Sex is the need,
not a want.

2060
02:14:02,750 --> 02:14:06,110
Sex legalization is the future of America.

2061
02:14:07,080 --> 02:14:10,290
I like it. Sex is a need, not a want.

2062
02:14:11,910 --> 02:14:15,450
Legalization, it's, it's
the next logical step.

2063
02:14:15,840 --> 02:14:19,860
The fact that our country has it in
one single state and only within the

2064
02:14:19,861 --> 02:14:24,270
constraints of specific locations
within that straight is of course very

2065
02:14:24,271 --> 02:14:25,104
limiting.

2066
02:14:25,260 --> 02:14:28,890
It means that you're required to travel
to Nevada in order to legally spend time

2067
02:14:28,891 --> 02:14:30,780
with a sex worker in the United States.

2068
02:14:30,810 --> 02:14:34,410
And for a lot of people
that's not feasible.

2069
02:14:34,560 --> 02:14:39,560
And so having a legal options that are
run very similar to the Nevada brothels

2070
02:14:39,561 --> 02:14:40,170
system,

2071
02:14:40,170 --> 02:14:44,970
but in other locations I think is where
our country is going to inevitably be

2072
02:14:44,971 --> 02:14:45,804
going.

2073
02:14:46,090 --> 02:14:47,140
Yeah,
it's ridiculous.

2074
02:14:47,141 --> 02:14:51,250
I mean I eat because if we're viewing
it through the lens of a need,

2075
02:14:51,310 --> 02:14:56,310
of course sex workers are everywhere and
they just get pushed underground where

2076
02:14:56,920 --> 02:15:01,920
safety is compromised and there's
no oversight in the case that it is

2077
02:15:02,020 --> 02:15:05,170
maintained, is illegal in
those locations. So it's,

2078
02:15:05,200 --> 02:15:10,200
it's going to exist whether regulators
choose to ignore it or systematize it and

2079
02:15:11,921 --> 02:15:16,000
embrace it in some capacity and they
might as well get the tax revenue and

2080
02:15:16,090 --> 02:15:19,680
decrease the risks for everyone involved.
So I agree.

2081
02:15:19,870 --> 02:15:24,870
It's often said that prostitution is
the oldest profession and that really is

2082
02:15:26,951 --> 02:15:27,281
true.

2083
02:15:27,281 --> 02:15:32,281
I mean if you look back into history and
you go back into ancient soon there and

2084
02:15:32,381 --> 02:15:35,170
Mesopotamia and Babylonian society,

2085
02:15:35,171 --> 02:15:40,171
you have this incredible conceptual
realization of something called sacred

2086
02:15:40,361 --> 02:15:43,720
sexuality where by doing sex work,

2087
02:15:43,721 --> 02:15:46,570
that's what brought them closer
to their deities at that time.

2088
02:15:46,571 --> 02:15:49,030
That's what brought them
closer to the divine.

2089
02:15:49,510 --> 02:15:51,580
The sex workers or in this case,

2090
02:15:51,581 --> 02:15:55,240
they were also priestesses
of their particular deity.

2091
02:15:55,700 --> 02:15:59,560
We're incredibly revered.
They lived in the temples themselves.

2092
02:15:59,561 --> 02:16:02,110
They were treated like gold.

2093
02:16:02,111 --> 02:16:05,920
They were incredibly well respected for
the service they provided to society.

2094
02:16:06,280 --> 02:16:10,930
When you look back on how the
Kings of Europe treated their,

2095
02:16:11,650 --> 02:16:15,400
their, um, mistresses for example,

2096
02:16:15,401 --> 02:16:20,080
oftentimes gifting them with titles
and nobility and land lavish jewels,

2097
02:16:20,860 --> 02:16:23,920
sex workers that have always
been treated as a treasure.

2098
02:16:24,130 --> 02:16:28,570
And it's only in recent societal times
that we've instead taking this negative

2099
02:16:28,571 --> 02:16:31,960
connotation kind of attached
that on to sex work.

2100
02:16:34,430 --> 02:16:36,860
Yeah, yeah. No, it's a,

2101
02:16:38,240 --> 02:16:39,073
yeah.

2102
02:16:39,280 --> 02:16:42,400
Ah, there's so many, there's so
many changes needed in this country,

2103
02:16:42,460 --> 02:16:46,660
but that's certainly one
of them. Uh, if you were,

2104
02:16:47,260 --> 02:16:49,870
let's say you had a chance to educate

2105
02:16:51,910 --> 02:16:53,350
a class of young minds,

2106
02:16:53,410 --> 02:16:58,230
so you are given the
opportunity to teach a class.

2107
02:16:58,780 --> 02:17:03,780
So say once per week seminar for semester
for college freshmen or a college

2108
02:17:05,591 --> 02:17:08,560
seniors. It could be even high
school, let's say high school,

2109
02:17:08,561 --> 02:17:11,170
senior or college freshmen.
Let's just say that.

2110
02:17:11,680 --> 02:17:15,220
What would you teach and what would you,
what would you focus on?

2111
02:17:15,221 --> 02:17:16,480
It does not have to be sex related,

2112
02:17:16,481 --> 02:17:20,290
but if you had to teach something that
you feel you know a lot about that you'd

2113
02:17:20,291 --> 02:17:23,440
be qualified to teach on in some way,
what would you teach?

2114
02:17:23,500 --> 02:17:24,370
What would the class be?

2115
02:17:26,750 --> 02:17:31,700
I think I would give
lectures about interpersonal
relationships and connectivity

2116
02:17:31,701 --> 02:17:33,920
as it relates to our society as a whole.

2117
02:17:34,550 --> 02:17:39,550
Why we should be more cognizant of how we
treat our service staff, waitresses, um,

2118
02:17:40,070 --> 02:17:42,920
hotel, Khan, share staff,
things of that nature,

2119
02:17:43,370 --> 02:17:47,990
how we interact with humanity around
us as a whole. How do we treat,

2120
02:17:48,050 --> 02:17:52,070
say, the Mcdonald's worker or the
person checking us out at Walmart?

2121
02:17:52,280 --> 02:17:55,610
How do we interact with our
classmates and our colleagues?

2122
02:17:55,611 --> 02:18:00,050
What about the interpersonal relationship
between that student teacher dynamic?

2123
02:18:00,290 --> 02:18:05,290
I think I'd want to really go into talking
about the depth and meanings of those

2124
02:18:05,751 --> 02:18:09,080
different connections and how they can
be used to better and enrich our lives in

2125
02:18:09,081 --> 02:18:09,914
society.

2126
02:18:10,820 --> 02:18:15,110
If we're able to change that generational
mindset of the youth and get them to

2127
02:18:15,111 --> 02:18:18,680
put their cell phone down and sit down
and have a meal where they're talking

2128
02:18:18,681 --> 02:18:23,000
amongst their peers,
that's going to generate new ideas,

2129
02:18:23,001 --> 02:18:25,100
that's going to generate new innovations.

2130
02:18:25,101 --> 02:18:28,970
That's what's going to take us to that
next point in our society where all of

2131
02:18:28,971 --> 02:18:32,780
these things we say we'd
like to accomplish within
our society will actually be

2132
02:18:32,781 --> 02:18:36,650
achievable through that unitive mind,

2133
02:18:36,830 --> 02:18:41,830
that cognitive collection of everyone
contributing and interacting and working

2134
02:18:42,891 --> 02:18:47,570
together and kind of forming this
unity and this bond. And sure,

2135
02:18:47,571 --> 02:18:50,390
you could say that it could be about sex,

2136
02:18:50,750 --> 02:18:55,730
but really I think that it comes
down to that level of connectivity,

2137
02:18:55,731 --> 02:19:00,500
that level of interpersonal
relationship is vital to humankind.

2138
02:19:03,010 --> 02:19:03,843
I agree.

2139
02:19:04,600 --> 02:19:09,600
So now we're at the tail end of this
conversation of this round one at least,

2140
02:19:10,660 --> 02:19:15,660
and people can find you online if
they wanted to say hello at Alice,

2141
02:19:15,971 --> 02:19:20,110
little on Twitter. Then you're on
the bunny ranch bunny ranch.com.

2142
02:19:20,111 --> 02:19:23,920
Forward Slash Alice Hyphen little,
uh,

2143
02:19:24,280 --> 02:19:27,140
where else can people find you online?
Okay.

2144
02:19:27,650 --> 02:19:31,210
Yup.
My Twitter is actually at the Alison.

2145
02:19:32,460 --> 02:19:36,750
Sorry about that at Alice Little,
uh,

2146
02:19:37,520 --> 02:19:41,650
all right. Then I also maintain
my own personal website and blog,

2147
02:19:42,040 --> 02:19:47,040
the alis little.com and you can go
on there to see photos of myself,

2148
02:19:48,010 --> 02:19:52,210
go through my blog and see
about the different topics
I write about the websites.

2149
02:19:52,211 --> 02:19:55,570
Also designed to kind of walk you
through the different experiences and

2150
02:19:55,571 --> 02:19:57,100
encounters that are available.

2151
02:19:57,520 --> 02:20:01,420
And of course any questions
related to sex work I'm open to.

2152
02:20:01,690 --> 02:20:05,260
It's very important that we talk about
these things that it's very important to

2153
02:20:05,500 --> 02:20:07,240
embrace that curiosity.

2154
02:20:07,241 --> 02:20:11,230
So if anyone wants to know anything
about what it is I do on the service I

2155
02:20:11,231 --> 02:20:15,110
provide, I would love to get to know
you and I'd love to interact with you.

2156
02:20:16,210 --> 02:20:19,270
Email is probably the,
the best way to do it,

2157
02:20:19,300 --> 02:20:23,530
which is aliceLittle@bunnyranch.com.

2158
02:20:24,120 --> 02:20:26,160
Oh God, you just did it. Okay.

2159
02:20:26,730 --> 02:20:31,380
You may have to modify your
email management approach,

2160
02:20:33,210 --> 02:20:35,640
which is fine. We're just
fine. You will be getting a,

2161
02:20:35,641 --> 02:20:39,210
I don't think you'll have to worry
about getting too few email. Uh, so,

2162
02:20:40,130 --> 02:20:43,510
Hey, I look forward to it. I am all in.

2163
02:20:43,730 --> 02:20:48,510
All right. Do you may, you
may, you may get the hug of
death. This is one of those,

2164
02:20:48,511 --> 02:20:49,800
be careful what you ask for things.

2165
02:20:49,830 --> 02:20:54,830
Is there anything else that you would
like to suggest to the people listening or

2166
02:20:57,691 --> 02:20:59,970
to recommend to them to ask of them?

2167
02:20:59,971 --> 02:21:04,971
Is there anything else you'd like to
communicate or impart before we wrap up

2168
02:21:06,421 --> 02:21:07,680
this conversation?

2169
02:21:09,320 --> 02:21:11,270
I would say as an overarching message,

2170
02:21:11,271 --> 02:21:14,060
if there was really one thing that
I had to ask of your viewership,

2171
02:21:14,540 --> 02:21:19,310
it would be to have an honest
conversation about sex with someone.

2172
02:21:19,610 --> 02:21:23,000
It doesn't have to be your significant
other. It could be a friend,

2173
02:21:23,001 --> 02:21:27,080
it could be a peer, it could be
a professor, it could even be me.

2174
02:21:27,380 --> 02:21:29,780
But let's talk about sex.

2175
02:21:29,990 --> 02:21:34,640
Our society as a whole isn't talking
about this and sex isn't going away.

2176
02:21:34,641 --> 02:21:39,380
It's a natural and normal part of being
an adult in society and it's something

2177
02:21:39,381 --> 02:21:41,540
that we should feel more
comfortable talking about.

2178
02:21:41,810 --> 02:21:45,710
So go ahead and try to have that
conversation and might be a little bit

2179
02:21:45,711 --> 02:21:48,420
uncomfortable at first.
But I guarantee you,

2180
02:21:48,430 --> 02:21:51,920
if you push yourself and you actually
engage in that kind of interaction,

2181
02:21:52,040 --> 02:21:54,290
you're going to grow as a
person for it and really,

2182
02:21:54,320 --> 02:21:56,150
really benefit from it as a whole.

2183
02:21:58,210 --> 02:22:02,530
Good advice. Very, very good
advice. And, uh, and you know,

2184
02:22:02,531 --> 02:22:05,800
another tool in the toolkit that I'll
recommend for people is to check out a

2185
02:22:05,801 --> 02:22:08,330
book called,
uh,

2186
02:22:08,710 --> 02:22:12,250
and I think this applies
in many circumstances, uh,

2187
02:22:12,251 --> 02:22:14,830
to things that we are loath to talk about.

2188
02:22:14,860 --> 02:22:18,220
But there's a book called
radical acceptance by Tara
Brock has also been on this

2189
02:22:18,221 --> 02:22:19,990
podcast that I think is a useful,

2190
02:22:20,560 --> 02:22:25,560
perhaps a useful wedge for getting your
foot in the door to be open to accept

2191
02:22:26,881 --> 02:22:30,990
certain things about yourself and
then then discussed them. Uh, Alice,

2192
02:22:30,991 --> 02:22:33,540
this has been so much fun.
Thank you so much for taking the time.

2193
02:22:34,490 --> 02:22:37,490
Oh, absolutely. I had a blast.
Thank you so much for having me.

2194
02:22:37,491 --> 02:22:40,010
I really appreciate it and
everything that you do.

2195
02:22:40,650 --> 02:22:42,840
Thank you. Uh, this is, this has been,

2196
02:22:42,880 --> 02:22:47,400
I feel like this conversation has been
a longtime coming since 11 minutes.

2197
02:22:47,430 --> 02:22:52,430
Found me 10 years ago and so
much more food for thought.

2198
02:22:52,621 --> 02:22:54,210
And I'm sure I'll have many,
many more questions.

2199
02:22:54,211 --> 02:22:58,830
So perhaps we'll do around two at some
point. But for everyone else that, yeah,

2200
02:22:59,100 --> 02:23:03,510
I'm sure that there will be many
followups and uh, God saved your inbox.

2201
02:23:03,840 --> 02:23:04,673
But

2202
02:23:05,200 --> 02:23:08,440
Hey, send me your sex questions.
Here we go. Let's do that

2203
02:23:10,070 --> 02:23:12,890
and for everybody listening, uh, as usual,

2204
02:23:12,920 --> 02:23:15,710
you can find links to everything
that we've talked about,

2205
02:23:15,711 --> 02:23:20,480
including the books,
the websites, the Alis,

2206
02:23:20,481 --> 02:23:21,980
little.com at the Alis,

2207
02:23:21,981 --> 02:23:25,490
little on Twitter and so on in the show
notes along with the show notes for

2208
02:23:25,491 --> 02:23:28,280
every other episode@tim.blog
forward slash,

2209
02:23:28,610 --> 02:23:32,120
podcast and as always,
until next time,

2210
02:23:32,420 --> 02:23:33,890
thank you for listening.

2211
02:23:35,040 --> 02:23:38,430
Hey guys, this is Tim again. Just a
few more things before you take off.

2212
02:23:38,790 --> 02:23:41,400
Number one,
this is five bullet Friday.

2213
02:23:41,700 --> 02:23:44,640
Do you want to get a short email from me?

2214
02:23:44,700 --> 02:23:48,840
Would you enjoy getting a short email
from me every Friday that provides a

2215
02:23:48,841 --> 02:23:52,830
little morsel of fun before the weekend
and five bullet Friday is a very short

2216
02:23:52,831 --> 02:23:57,600
email where I share the coolest things
I found or that I've been pondering over

2217
02:23:57,601 --> 02:24:01,020
the week. That could include favorite
new albums that I've discovered.

2218
02:24:01,021 --> 02:24:04,500
It could include Gizmos and gadgets
and all sorts of weird shit that I've

2219
02:24:04,501 --> 02:24:08,790
somehow dug up in the other,
the world of the esoteric as I do.

2220
02:24:09,090 --> 02:24:14,090
It could include favorite articles that
I've read and that I've shared with my

2221
02:24:14,731 --> 02:24:17,460
close friends for instance,
and it's very short.

2222
02:24:17,550 --> 02:24:22,530
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness
before you head off for the weekend,

2223
02:24:22,620 --> 02:24:24,750
so if you want to receive that,
check it out.

2224
02:24:25,050 --> 02:24:29,700
Just go to four hour work week.com that's
four hour work week.com all spelled

2225
02:24:29,701 --> 02:24:33,840

will get the very next one if you sign

2226
02:24:33,841 --> 02:24:38,460
up. I hope you enjoy it. This episode
is brought to you by fresh books,

2227
02:24:38,520 --> 02:24:39,211
man.
Oh Man.

2228
02:24:39,211 --> 02:24:43,710
Do a lot of listeners to this podcast
and readers of mind love fresh books to

2229
02:24:43,711 --> 02:24:47,370
the extent that I ended up meeting
with the CEO not very long ago.

2230
02:24:47,880 --> 02:24:49,530
Why are they so popular?
Well,

2231
02:24:49,680 --> 02:24:53,700
they are the number one cloud accounting
software designed exclusively for self

2232
02:24:53,730 --> 02:24:55,080
employed professionals.

2233
02:24:55,110 --> 02:24:57,860
That's many of you and used by
more than 10 million people.

2234
02:24:57,900 --> 02:25:01,860
You can send invoices, track your
time and get paid very, very quickly,

2235
02:25:02,040 --> 02:25:04,490
which suits the needs of a lot
of freelancers I locked onto,

2236
02:25:04,500 --> 02:25:08,700
I forgot the words and beyond.
You can't take pictures of receipts.

2237
02:25:08,701 --> 02:25:10,170
You can link your credit
card and debit card,

2238
02:25:10,171 --> 02:25:15,150
so all the things you buy automatically
appear in your fresh books in the right

2239
02:25:15,151 --> 02:25:18,750
category, so on and so forth. Makes
taxes easy, makes invoices easy.

2240
02:25:18,751 --> 02:25:23,440
It makes your life easier. And
also in fact, I recommend a pdf.

2241
02:25:23,920 --> 02:25:25,360
They didn't ask me to
read this part by the way.

2242
02:25:25,630 --> 02:25:30,220
They put the other pdf awhile back called
breaking the time barrier. Subtitle,

2243
02:25:30,221 --> 02:25:33,250
how to unlock your true earning potential
so you can search for breaking the

2244
02:25:33,251 --> 02:25:35,470
time barrier.
A lot of people ask me,

2245
02:25:36,220 --> 02:25:40,120
how can I get a four hour work week
with a service business and the story in

2246
02:25:40,121 --> 02:25:43,690
that Ebook, it's pdf is the short
answer's really, really good.

2247
02:25:43,750 --> 02:25:46,480
So I think you should also check that out.
So breaking the time error,

2248
02:25:46,620 --> 02:25:50,140
check it out,
but also why not test out fresh bucks.

Enjoy. This episode is
brought to you by me undies.

2255
02:26:18,700 --> 02:26:21,400
I've spent the last few years
wearing underwear from these guys,

2256
02:26:21,401 --> 02:26:25,930
24 seven or close to it outside of showers
and sexy time and swimming and they

2257
02:26:25,931 --> 02:26:29,500
are the most comfortable and
colorful underwear I've ever owned.

2258
02:26:29,620 --> 02:26:32,590
You just check out the camouflage
boxer briefs. I'm a big fan.

2259
02:26:33,010 --> 02:26:37,750
Me undies are designed in La and made
from sustainably sourced microbe down.

2260
02:26:37,840 --> 02:26:41,530
What's that? It is a fabric and three
times softer than cotton. Trust me.

2261
02:26:41,770 --> 02:26:44,470
Try it out. You'll understand
why I wear these so much.

2262
02:26:44,710 --> 02:26:47,930
If underwear isn't your thing though,
I would imagine everyone wears under,

2263
02:26:47,940 --> 02:26:51,250
but if it isn't your
thing me also makes socks.

2264
02:26:51,310 --> 02:26:53,380
Their socks are spun
from premium material,

2265
02:26:53,440 --> 02:26:58,240
making them just as comfortable
as the underwear. Now, right now,

02:26:58,530 --> 02:27:02,170
