1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,820
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02,821 --> 00:00:07,360
I can run flat out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking it.

3
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:16,190
I'm a cybernetic organism
living tissue over

4
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,630
this episode is brought to you

5
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,390
by four sigmatic.

6
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:30,190
I reached out to these
Finnish entrepreneurs after
a very talented acrobat,

7
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,140
introduced me to one of their products,

8
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:37,590
which blew my mind and the best
way possible it is mushroom coffee.

9
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,740
What on earth is this? Well,
it includes Chaga mushroom,

10
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:44,800
very powerful antioxidant,
considered a super food.

11
00:00:44,801 --> 00:00:47,350
I was introduced to
Chaga by Laird Hamilton,

12
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:49,480
the King of Big Wave
Surfing of all things,

13
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:53,590
and it includes another mushroom that
is considered a no tropic, a smart drug,

14
00:00:53,591 --> 00:00:57,800
and this is lion's mane in the entire
packet. You just add it to hot water.

15
00:00:57,801 --> 00:01:02,560
It tastes like coffee.
There is only 40 milligrams of caffeine,

16
00:01:02,561 --> 00:01:05,830
so less than half what you
would find in a cup of coffee.

17
00:01:05,831 --> 00:01:07,450
So I do not get any jitters.

18
00:01:07,451 --> 00:01:12,451
I do not get any acid reflux or any type
of stomach burn and it put me on fire

19
00:01:13,871 --> 00:01:17,470
for an entire day and I
only had half of the packet.

20
00:01:17,471 --> 00:01:19,630
So this stuff is really amazing.

21
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:23,320
People are always asking me what I use
for cognitive enhancement. Right now.

22
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:27,850
This is the answer, so it is legal.
It will not give you visuals.

23
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:32,470
That's something else and you can try it

Tim

29
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,290
this episode is brought to
you by Wealthfront and this
is a very unique sponsor.

30
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,060
Wealthfront is a massively disruptive
in a good way, set it and forget it.

31
00:02:03,061 --> 00:02:07,440
Investing service led by technologists
from places like apple and world famous

32
00:02:07,441 --> 00:02:08,160
investors.

33
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,880
It has exploded in popularity in the last
two years and they now have more than

34
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:14,910
two and a half billion dollars
under management. In fact,

35
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,260
some of my very good friends,

36
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:19,470
investors in silicon valley have millions
of their own money in Wealthfront.

37
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,530
So the question is why? Why is
it so popular? Why is it unique?

38
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,820
Because you can get services previously
reserved for the ultra wealthy but only

39
00:02:26,821 --> 00:02:28,830
pay pennies on the dollar for them.

40
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,550
And this is because they use smarter
software instead of retail locations,

41
00:02:32,551 --> 00:02:35,280
bloated sales teams, et cetera. And
I'll come back to that in a second.

42
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:40,440
I suggest you check out wealthfront.com
forward slash Tim take the risk

43
00:02:40,441 --> 00:02:41,191
assessment quiz,

44
00:02:41,191 --> 00:02:45,090
which only takes two to five minutes and
they'll show you for free exactly the

45
00:02:45,091 --> 00:02:48,030
portfolio they'd put you in.
And if you just want to take their advice,

46
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:51,420
run with it, do it yourself.
You can do that or as I would,

47
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,310
you can set it and forget it.
And here's why.

48
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:57,630
The value of Wealthfront is in the
automation of habits and strategies that

49
00:02:57,631 --> 00:03:01,030
investors should be on a regular
basis but normally aren't.

50
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,730
Great investing is a marathon,
not a sprint,

51
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,040
and little things that you may
or may not be familiar with.

52
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:09,520
Like automatic tax loss harvesting,
rebalancing your portfolio,

53
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:14,020
cross more than 10 asset classes and
dividend reinvestment add up to very large

54
00:03:14,021 --> 00:03:17,740
amounts of money over longer periods
of time. Wealthfront, as I mentioned,

55
00:03:17,741 --> 00:03:20,350
since it's using software
instead of retail locations,

56
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:24,520
etc. Can offer all of this at low
costs that were previously completely

57
00:03:24,521 --> 00:03:26,020
impossible.
Right off the bat,

58
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,570
you never pay commissions or
account fees for everything.

59
00:03:28,571 --> 00:03:33,571
They charge 0.25% per year on assets above
the first 15,000 which is managed for

60
00:03:34,211 --> 00:03:36,220
free.
If you use my link,

61
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:40,600
wealthfront.com forward slash Tim that
is less than $5 a month to invest a

62
00:03:40,601 --> 00:03:44,650
$30,000 account for instance.
Now, normally when I have
a sponsor on this show,

63
00:03:44,651 --> 00:03:48,220
it's because I use them and
recommend them. In this case
it's a little different.

64
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:52,510
I don't use wealth front yet because
I'm not allowed to. Here's the deal.

65
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,770
They wanted to sponsor this podcast,
but because of sec regulations,

66
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:00,430
companies that invest your money are
not allowed to use client testimonials.

67
00:04:00,431 --> 00:04:03,280
So I couldn't be a user end
have them on the podcast,

68
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:07,360
but I've been so impressed by Wealthfront
that I've invested a significant

69
00:04:07,361 --> 00:04:11,200
amount of my own money, at least for me,
uh, in the team and the company itself.

70
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:14,350
So I am an investor and hope
to soon use it as a client.

71
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,860
Now back to the recommendation
as a Tim Ferriss show listener,

72
00:04:17,861 --> 00:04:21,730
you'll get $15,000 managed for free
if you decide to open an account.

73
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:24,760
But just start with seeing the portfolio
that they would suggest for you.

74
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:28,930
Take two minutes, fill out their
questionnaire@wealthfront.com
forward slash. Tim,

75
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:32,050
it's fast, it's free. There's
no downside that I can think of.

76
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,870
Little Boys and girls,
one bets and squirrels.

77
00:04:36,871 --> 00:04:40,440
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another
episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

78
00:04:40,441 --> 00:04:43,620
it is my job to deconstruct world
class performers, tease out the habits,

79
00:04:43,621 --> 00:04:47,040
routines, favorite books, etc.
That you can use in your own life.

80
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:51,570
And I'm speaking in hushed tones
cause I'm in the airport in,

81
00:04:51,571 --> 00:04:55,020
I don't like to yell and scream like a
lunatic one in the airport lest I get a

82
00:04:55,021 --> 00:04:58,890
boot on my head.
So the guest Mike Birbiglia,

83
00:04:58,891 --> 00:05:00,720
I've wanted to interview Mike for years.

84
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,970
You can find them on Twitter
at [inaudible] Bir vigs.

85
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:08,790
He is one of the best known and
busiest working comedians in the world,

86
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:12,750
both behind and in front of the camera.
His standup blends a lot of elements,

87
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,900
different elements, theater,
film, storytelling and comedy.

88
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:20,010
This is of interest to me because
he's been very deliberate in studying

89
00:05:20,011 --> 00:05:24,060
different crafts and tying them together
and this is reflected in his string of

90
00:05:24,061 --> 00:05:28,020
successes which include sold out
tours as a solar theater act.

91
00:05:28,021 --> 00:05:30,510
He just did a hundred
cities not too long ago,

92
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:33,930
New York Times bestselling books
off Broadway shows, feature film TV,

93
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:37,860
and much more in the last few years
has work has started to appear on this

94
00:05:37,861 --> 00:05:38,730
American life,

95
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:44,070
which is an incredible show and a podcast
for those interested where he began a

96
00:05:44,071 --> 00:05:48,210
meaningful collaboration with the host
and producer Ira glass who I'd love to

97
00:05:48,211 --> 00:05:51,450
have on the podcast at some point.
Currently Mike is the creator,

98
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:54,960
writer and star of the new film,
don't think twice,

99
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:58,250
which is hilarious.
Heartrending

100
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:00,590
just a wonderful watch.

101
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:05,320
I saw an early preview copy and it
blew me away, so I highly recommended.

102
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,850
I don't say that lightly.
It's a great movie.

103
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:12,680
If you've struggled with notions
of feeling like a failure,

104
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,500
hoping for success,
achieving some degree of success,

105
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:18,290
and then getting more or less
than you bargained for, it's,

106
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:19,700
it's an incredible journey.

107
00:06:19,701 --> 00:06:24,080
So I do recommend you check that out and
had hell does he pull all of this stuff

108
00:06:24,081 --> 00:06:27,890
off? He seems to be juggling
a million projects. I am to
find out. We dig into it.

109
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:31,430
So without further ado,
please enjoy Mike Birbiglia.

110
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,860
Mike, Welcome to the show. Thanks. Damn.

111
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:42,070
It's a very exciting and timely
for me to be here and uh,

112
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:46,370
because I, because I'm, I'm, I'm,
I'm digging into all of your stuff.

113
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,730
I'm immersing myself in.
It is affecting my life in real time.

114
00:06:49,731 --> 00:06:54,320
So speaking with you is almost a
virtual reality experience. Well,

115
00:06:54,321 --> 00:06:59,321
I think this is a mutual feeling since
I've been a consumer and fan of your

116
00:06:59,631 --> 00:07:04,631
comedy for so long and I've
started thinking after Elon
Musk hints that we could

117
00:07:04,701 --> 00:07:09,701
be logically speaking players in
some sophisticated future entities,

118
00:07:10,401 --> 00:07:14,960
video game, uh, that, um, this
might all be a virtual reality.

119
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:17,810
I'll be at a very sophisticated one.

120
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:22,010
But if I want it to bring
us back to the earth,

121
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,660
at least as we understand it for a second,

122
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:29,180
I painted a number of mutual friends
of ours, Brian Koppelman of course,

123
00:07:29,181 --> 00:07:32,810
fame, screenwriter, all around.
Good guy. Uh, Chris Saka,

124
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,400
both of whom had been on
the podcast before because
they've spent some time with

125
00:07:37,401 --> 00:07:38,234
you.

126
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:43,220
And I wanted to ask a number
of things that they brought up.

127
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,910
So the first was from compliment
and I asked very specifically,

128
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,120
does he have any obsessions that you know
of outside of comedy and one word back

129
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:57,200
pizza. That's correct. So can
you elaborate on this please?

130
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:02,290
If that's an embarrassing,
uh, session is, it's simple,

131
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,160
you know, it's, it's, it's bread and
cheese and sauce. I mean, if that,

132
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:10,940
hearing you say that makes me realize
how simple of a human being I am.

133
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:15,260
I have a joke for my first album to drink
Mike, which is, I love pizza so much.

134
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:16,520
I would marry,
it would,

135
00:08:16,521 --> 00:08:19,760
it would just be an elaborate ploy to
eat her whole family at the reception,

136
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:25,190
but it's a [inaudible]. So seven,
so stupid. Yeah. I love pizza.

137
00:08:25,191 --> 00:08:29,300
I think it's just, you know, it's the
simplicity of it. It's from my childhood.

138
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:32,570
It's, Eh, there's no deeper
meaning other than my,

139
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:37,190
by the time my mom raised me,
um,

140
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,450
that's,

141
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:41,480
that's Friday and saying that because
I was raised by my mother and father,

142
00:08:41,481 --> 00:08:44,870
but my mother was around more often.
Um,

143
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:49,970
she really kind of gave up on
parenting and ordered pizza a lot.

144
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,790
Yeah. You know, like she
didn't want to cook that much
then, so she'd just be like,

145
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:57,450
let's just order pizza. So just got
very used to it and now I figure,

146
00:08:57,451 --> 00:09:01,410
well, in my adulthood I might as well
be a connoisseur and have good pizza.

147
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:04,650
So what now qualifies
for you is good pizza.

148
00:09:04,651 --> 00:09:09,180
If you could have one type
of pizza delivered to you.

149
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,460
And I'm sure there are many options,
but a is, are you a deep dish?

150
00:09:14,461 --> 00:09:17,970
Are you a New York style thin crust?
What are we talking? Yeah. Yeah,

151
00:09:17,971 --> 00:09:22,200
I think there's two kinds of pizza
that I liked most. One is New York,

152
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,230
New York, uh, thin crust,
uh, coal oven, and um,

153
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:32,240
places like Arturo's and
Lucali. Uh, Lewd. So,

154
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:37,560
and then I have this odd, you know, from
my childhood, just in Massachusetts,

155
00:09:37,561 --> 00:09:39,090
there's a ton of Greek people.
