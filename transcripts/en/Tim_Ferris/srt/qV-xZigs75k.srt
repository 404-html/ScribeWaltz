1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,860
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02,861 --> 00:00:06,760
I can run flat out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking it.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:08,573
Question,

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,970
I'm a cybernetic organism living.

5
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:28,450
This episode is brought to you by Inc
tell and I've used them personally ever

6
00:00:28,451 --> 00:00:29,800
since I wrote the four hour workweek.

7
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:33,880
I've been asked over and over again
how I choose to delegate tasks,

8
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,850
how I do 80 20 analysis and so on.

9
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,780
At the root of many of those
decisions is a simple question.

10
00:00:40,781 --> 00:00:42,010
Actually two questions.
Number one,

11
00:00:42,011 --> 00:00:44,800
how can I invest money to
improve my quality of life?

12
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:47,500
I use that in investing as well.
The second,

13
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:52,770
how can I spend a little money or moderate
money to save significant time inc

14
00:00:53,231 --> 00:00:57,250
tell is one of those investments there
a turnkey solution for all of your

15
00:00:57,251 --> 00:00:58,930
imaginable customer care needs.

16
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:03,160
I used Intel during the launch of
the four hour body, which was very,

17
00:01:03,161 --> 00:01:07,570
very involved and they provided 24
seven customer service for my land rush

18
00:01:07,571 --> 00:01:12,130
campaign because it was critical for
me to take care of every person who

19
00:01:12,131 --> 00:01:13,690
purchased my books and participated.

20
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:18,340
This allowed me to focus on the things
that I am better. At my strengths,

21
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:21,700
like the marketing plan that
we'd worked on for six months,

22
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:24,790
implementing that until
trains their experience,

23
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:28,780
customer service reps to
know your business and your
products inside and out and

24
00:01:28,781 --> 00:01:30,730
make it your customers are raving fans.

25
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,840
They answer more than a million customer
service requests every year and they

26
00:01:34,841 --> 00:01:39,610
can do so across all platforms, including
email, phone, social media, texts,

27
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:40,683
even chat,

28
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:44,980
leaving your customers with poor
service or just mediocre service,

29
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:48,970
which by the way,
in a competitive pool is a huge liability.

30
00:01:48,971 --> 00:01:53,971
Long wait times are unanswered messages
carries a massive cost and risk to your

31
00:01:54,671 --> 00:01:55,750
business.
Uh,

32
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:59,860
Intel removes the logistics and
headaches of this type of communication,

33
00:01:59,861 --> 00:02:04,000
allowing you to focus on your
strengths and grow your business.

34
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,700
It can be a real competitive advantage.
And I see many,

35
00:02:06,701 --> 00:02:11,701
many ecommerce companies
and tech companies thinking
of customer service as a

36
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,800
good enough checkbox or an afterthought.

37
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:20,070
And it just like airbnb use design and
innovative ways to be a competitor and to

38
00:02:22,001 --> 00:02:24,400
when you can do the same
thing with customer service.

of my businesses and many of the icons on

used legal zoom. For instance,

48
00:02:58,161 --> 00:03:02,710

doing a proper trademark search,
forming an LLC,

53
00:03:14,681 --> 00:03:19,540
setting up a nonprofit or finding simple
cease and desist letter templates. Man,

54
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:22,930
do I use a lot of those? Uh,
legal zoom is not a law firm,

67
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:17,080
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another
episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

68
00:04:17,081 --> 00:04:21,490
it is my job to deconstruct world class
performers of all different types from

69
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:26,170
the worlds of business, military,
entertainment, athletics,

70
00:04:26,171 --> 00:04:29,110
and sometimes combinations
of different fields,

71
00:04:29,111 --> 00:04:32,080
and that is the case with this interview.
Of course,

72
00:04:32,081 --> 00:04:35,710
the objective is to tease out
tactics, routines, habits,

73
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,570
specifics that you can use.

74
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,740
And my guest this time
around is by popular request,

75

77
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:54,430
He is one of the fittest men in the world,

78
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:59,520
a title that was officially his when he
earned it at the crossfit games and won

79
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:04,120
the crossfit games in 2008 he is an
eight time crossfit games competitor,

80
00:05:04,121 --> 00:05:08,800
a three time team USA crossfit member
and among other athletic feats.

81
00:05:08,801 --> 00:05:10,630
He is dead,
lifted 550 lbs,

82
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:15,660
squatted 450 pounds and performed 64
pullups at a body weight of 210 pounds.

83
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:17,920
This podcast,

84
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:22,810

90
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:41,320
Jason is also a very
successful entrepreneur.

91
00:05:41,321 --> 00:05:43,720
He is the founder and CEO of NC fit,

which has more than 20 locations in
eight different cities and he is the co

the hardest workouts he's ever performed,

the mentor who taught
him how to sell anything,

100
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:16,880
which is hilarious how he and his family
have coped with his daughters battle

101
00:06:16,881 --> 00:06:21,620
with cancer. How he has navigated going
from competitive athlete. Two very,

episode as much as I did.

104
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,350

forward slash Tim Ferris.

108
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,590
Jason,
we'll do a quick sound check.

109
00:06:45,591 --> 00:06:47,930
Could you please tell me
what you had for breakfast?

110
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,860
I had Kale smoothie and
an egg with Bacon on top.

111
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:56,330
One egg with Bacon on top.
One egg, a whole egg. Nope.

112
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,450
Cause I was on the road at 4:00 AM I went
to Starbucks and I took the sandwich.

113
00:06:59,451 --> 00:07:02,510
I took it apart and I just had the
egg with the Bacon on top. Nice.

114
00:07:02,511 --> 00:07:05,990
And then the Kale smoothie was before he
left the house. A Kale smoothie was, uh,

115
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,250
at the gym before I, yeah, shortly after.

116
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:15,480
What is in the Kale smoothie besides Kale,
Cale peanut butter. Um, some of this, uh,

117
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:19,740
projects, uh, like protein
powder and almond milk.

118
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,821
Fantastic.
Well,

119
00:07:20,821 --> 00:07:23,910
I think we're just gonna keep rolling
since that sound check was so successful.

120
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,420
And while my pooch, Molly's gonna make
a racket thrown around an elk antler,

121
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:33,660
we're just going to get to it. So
welcome to the show and we'll be my look.

122
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:35,880
My living room. Thanks for
calling. It's great to be here.

123
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:40,950
And we just had some fun demoing
things and certainly learning things.

124
00:07:40,951 --> 00:07:44,370
I wasn't doing anything I was
observing in the gym, in the garage.

125
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,240
So for people who are listening and want
some additional video, which I highly,

126
00:07:48,241 --> 00:07:48,881
highly encourage,

127
00:07:48,881 --> 00:07:53,881
just go to tim.blog/podcast and click on
this episode or you can go to youtube,

128
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,820
Tim Ferriss, two r's, two s's.
And you can find a bunch of video.

129
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,230
Now you are considered,
and I know you're not going to say this,

130
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:05,310
but a Demi God within the world
of crossfit by a lot of people,

131
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:09,380
people look up to you for good reason.
And I'm curious to know,

132
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:14,410
if you were to look back at
your peak competitive, uh,

133
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:15,403
success,

134
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:19,790
what do you think the advantages
were that you had or developed?

135
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:22,280
Like why were you as
successful as you were?

136
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:27,020
And of course you have
incredible work ethic and so on,

137
00:08:27,021 --> 00:08:31,460
but if you, if you had to sort of dig
into that, what do you think the, the,

138
00:08:31,461 --> 00:08:34,140
the elements were that made
you as successful as you were?

139
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:38,650
I think primarily it was that
I really enjoyed training.
I didn't do it, you know,

140
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:40,090
a lot of people,
they like to compete.

141
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:42,940
I didn't necessarily like to
computer or did like to compete.

142
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:45,910
I enjoyed competing,
but I enjoyed training more.

143
00:08:45,911 --> 00:08:49,270
I like being in an environment that
just pushed me. I liked, I liked,

144
00:08:49,271 --> 00:08:51,670
I'm getting comfortable,
uncomfortable.

145
00:08:51,671 --> 00:08:54,250
I liked leaving the gym and feeling
like I just got my buck kicks.

146
00:08:54,251 --> 00:08:57,270
It made me feel good
about what I accomplished.

147
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:00,810
And then I went on and try to accomplish
that same concept in the rest of my

148
00:09:00,811 --> 00:09:01,644
life.
Right.

149
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:06,040
And I think that was something I really
picked up on early on when I first found

150
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:10,480
crossfit back in 2006 and then I won
the crossfit Games in Oh eight and I was

151
00:09:10,481 --> 00:09:14,440
able to compete eight more times, mainly
because I just love to train, you know,

152
00:09:14,441 --> 00:09:14,800
and,
and,

153
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,280
and the byproduct or the expression of
that was my ability to go out there and

154
00:09:18,281 --> 00:09:19,114
compete.

155
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Are there any particular workouts
that come to mind or exercises?

156
00:09:25,071 --> 00:09:28,880
Anything that you find
particularly enjoyable,

157
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,980
even though they might be very painful?

158
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:34,050
I mean, I, I liked the ones that give
you the biggest return, right? I mean,

159
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,720
I think if you're doing thrusters,
yes, they're very challenging,

160
00:09:36,721 --> 00:09:39,840
but they give you a huge
return in terms of benefit,

161
00:09:39,841 --> 00:09:42,960
in terms of the way you look in terms
of whether you feel the byproduct of

162
00:09:42,961 --> 00:09:45,450
strengths. I think thrusters,
burpees, those type things.

163
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,760
If I had to pick several
items I would only do,

164
00:09:47,761 --> 00:09:49,560
or several movements I'm wanting
to do for the rest of my life,

165
00:09:49,561 --> 00:09:51,050
it'd be things like that.
[inaudible]

166
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:55,030
if we were to say, look, while we're
going to look forward in a second,

167
00:09:55,031 --> 00:09:58,780
I want to keep focusing on that
for a moment. Any particular, uh,

168
00:09:58,781 --> 00:10:02,570
if you wanted to gage, say
the, the fitness right,

169
00:10:02,571 --> 00:10:05,510
they cross fitness of
anyone for that matter.

170
00:10:05,511 --> 00:10:08,840
Are there any particular tests that you
would put them through to evaluate that?

171
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:12,110
Whether it's like a certain variation
of Fran or anything like that?

172
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,190
I would just look at like different
metrics. I look at, you know,

173
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:18,710
what is your mile time? Uh, how
many pull ups can you complete? Uh,

174
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:23,390
what is your Max deadlift,
back squat press, um, and
then start looking at a few,

175
00:10:23,391 --> 00:10:26,030
like the movements that combine both.
Right.

176
00:10:26,031 --> 00:10:28,190
And so I think sometimes there's people
that are really good at running and

177
00:10:28,191 --> 00:10:30,380
there's some people that are
really good at, um, lifting.

178
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:34,160
But I think the beauty is when he can
combine those two. And so you know,

179
00:10:34,161 --> 00:10:36,800
a lot of like the Franz and
the different types of work.

180
00:10:36,801 --> 00:10:40,520
I like a fight gone bad score. Those are
good ways. And what is a fight going bad?

181
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:45,200
So Phicom vow was originally created
a with Bj Penn and Greg Glassman.

182
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,840
Oh yeah. Long time ago.
And baseball was, was,

183
00:10:47,841 --> 00:10:51,040
this was back when Bj was probably
training at the Health Gracie Academy in

184
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:55,700
mountain view old school long time ago.
And essentially what it is is one minute,

185
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,070
one minute, one minute,
five, five movements,

186
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,800
and then you one minute rest
and do that for three rounds.

187
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:04,970
What are the five movements? So it's a
Sumit old high pole. There's a push press,

188
00:11:04,971 --> 00:11:05,691
there's a rower,

189
00:11:05,691 --> 00:11:10,410
a wall ball and a box jump and all the
movements are light enough that you can

190
00:11:10,411 --> 00:11:14,130
keep moving on them. And so you know,
when Bj finished the, as the story goes,

191
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:16,980
when Bj finished it was like, aw
man, I feel like a fight gone bad.

192
00:11:16,981 --> 00:11:18,570
And so that's kind of how the story goes.

193
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:23,460
Just as a random side note,
I used to go to these chiropractors,

194
00:11:23,461 --> 00:11:27,630
the Jansens who worked on a lot of
fighters and I remember they described Bj

195
00:11:27,631 --> 00:11:31,020
Penn's hip flexors as the
hip flexors of a camel.

196
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:35,650
They said they were just like a
quadricep done normal humans. Just, uh,

197
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:42,180
if you were to say want to get someone
hooked on exercising because you enjoyed

198
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:47,500
the training, not everyone
enjoys training. So let's
say you're taking someone,

199
00:11:47,501 --> 00:11:50,950
you want to get them hooked
on that drug of training. Uh,

200
00:11:50,951 --> 00:11:52,660
is there any particular approach
that you would take? I mean,

201
00:11:52,661 --> 00:11:54,520
you've coached lot of people,
you've,

202
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:58,990
I'm sure encountered every different
type of person from NFL player to say

203
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:02,750
engineer who's never played sports
and everybody in between. Uh,

204
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:07,120
what do you do to get someone hooked so
that they continue to come to the gym?

205
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:11,340
Yes. I mean, I've been really
fortunate, you know, over the years. Um,

206
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:14,520
I started a company NC fit and we have
a ton of members and I've been able to

207
00:12:14,521 --> 00:12:18,630
look at it and say, hey, what is generally
gets them to kind of stay with us?

208
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:22,740
And more times than not, it's starting
off slow and then working their way up.

209
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:25,710
I think a lot of people get Gung Ho,
right? They come in, Oh, you know,

210
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:27,270
I want to lose weight.
I want to do this one or that.

211
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,540
I'll eat whatever you tell me,
I'll do whatever you told me.

212
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,340
And then all of a sudden a
month later they're gone. Right?

213
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,340
So I think the secret to success is, hey,
just take your time, right? This is not a,

214
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,590
this is, this is a
lifelong journey, right?

215
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:41,340
It's not like a one month you
don't fad. It's, you know,

216
00:12:41,341 --> 00:12:43,440
I want to be fit and I want to
be fit for the rest of my life.

217
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,410
And so I think it's important to recognize
that and it makes small steps towards

218
00:12:46,411 --> 00:12:50,440
the right direction. You
know, take out sugar, do this,
do that small little steps,

219
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,420
then go into the gym and
start doing certain stuff.

220
00:12:52,421 --> 00:12:55,120
But I think finding a comradery,
finding a coach,

221
00:12:55,121 --> 00:12:57,430
and find a community support you.
Our rule number one,

222
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,070
I think that doing it on your own
is very challenging. You know,

223
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:02,740
you and I were talking about cooking
earlier and it's like if I want to learn

224
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:06,130
how to cook, really, really learn how
to cook, I could learn from a book,

225
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,530
I could learn from maybe watching a show,

226
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,970
but to really kind of
dive into the nuances,

227
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,990
I would need to have someone to kind of
show me in the kitchen what I would do

228
00:13:13,991 --> 00:13:16,570
next. At least for me. Right. I
don't have enough experience with it.

229
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,930
And some people going to the gym, sure
they can read books, you can do stuff.

230
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,250
But I think having someone there,

231
00:13:21,251 --> 00:13:23,730
like a coach advise them
on different things is,

232
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:26,340
is is going to be an easy way for
them to get more success from it.

233
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:29,120
Yeah. I think the, just to reiterate that,

234
00:13:29,121 --> 00:13:32,600
I think the social accountability
piece is huge. So having some type of,

235
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,450
of social cohesion just gigantic.

236
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:38,840
And for people who are listening
who might be in the sticks,

237
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,460
don't think you have access to that.

238
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:44,810
You can certainly find communities online
like coach.me and other, uh, other,

239
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:47,300
other sites or services along those lines.
But the,

240
00:13:47,301 --> 00:13:51,760
the point you made also that I think is
really important to underscore is in the

241
00:13:51,761 --> 00:13:52,594
beginning,

242
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:58,410
focusing on the good program that you
will follow versus the perfect program

243
00:13:58,861 --> 00:14:02,100
that you'll fit that you'll quit. Because
a lot of people come in, like you said,

244
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:04,680
they're like, okay, I haven't
done anything since college.

245
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,670
Now I'm going to do a two hour workout
five times a week as my new year's

246
00:14:08,671 --> 00:14:12,760
resolution. And they just flame out or
they get injured or fill in the blank.

247
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:16,060
And like you said, they're gone a few
weeks later as opposed to saying, look,

248
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:20,530
since you're starting from zero,
let's just do whatever it might be,

249
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:25,930
half hour workout twice a week so that
you develop the habit and then you can

250
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:26,764
always make it harder,

251
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:29,590
more complex later. But if you make it
too hard, too complex in the beginning,

252
00:14:29,591 --> 00:14:30,640
you're going to be gone.
Yeah.

253
00:14:30,641 --> 00:14:34,030
Like we have a program that
we've incorporated calls
the rise program and what

254
00:14:34,031 --> 00:14:38,710
it incorporates, the nutritionist, a
mindset coach and I, and a fitness coach.

255
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:42,910
And for a lot of people, it's all a
mindset, right? It's all for decades.

256
00:14:42,911 --> 00:14:46,750
They haven't exercise, they've use food
as an outlet or whatever it may be. Right?

257
00:14:46,751 --> 00:14:47,584
And that's okay,

258
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:52,800
but they need to get over that in their
head to truly make an impact and change

259
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,610
for, for a long time. Right.

260
00:14:55,611 --> 00:14:58,220
Instead is making it like the short term
thing that you really get down to the

261
00:14:58,221 --> 00:15:03,221
root of the problem and make it as more
of a part of their daily routine instead

262
00:15:03,711 --> 00:15:06,170
of just something they do.
Right. And that starts,

263
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:10,500
but to start it slowly then work it up
is much easier than just to kind of go

264
00:15:10,501 --> 00:15:14,310
crazy. And then it just, I
haven't seen it work as well.

265
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:18,770
And then I have a nuclear meltdown and
have to restart again for your next new

266
00:15:18,771 --> 00:15:21,590
year's resolution. That's right. Uh,

267
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,890
I'm going to take a couple of
questions here that have been, uh,

268
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,850
volleyed over via the Internet because
there's some really good ones and they

269
00:15:28,851 --> 00:15:32,600
range from training to
family, to business. Uh,

270
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:35,360
so we're going to get to that in a
second, but I wanted to ask you, uh,

271
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:39,980
you mentioned NC fit.
How many locations do you currently have?

272
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,340
24,
24 locations.

273
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:48,730
So you've been very successful as an
athlete and many people who put in the

274
00:15:50,571 --> 00:15:51,950
effort and focus that you did.

275
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:56,030
And athletics are so singularly
focused that they have trouble.

276
00:15:56,031 --> 00:16:00,860
And I've observed this and friends
transferring them to a career outside of

277
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,250
competitor, rent sponsored athlete. Uh,

278
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:08,740
if you were sitting down with
an accomplished athlete or not,

279
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,540
who wanted to say,
uh,

280
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,910
get into business and let's
just for the sake of simplicity,

281
00:16:12,911 --> 00:16:16,330
say it's a similar business
there somewhere in the
Midwest and they want to get

282
00:16:16,331 --> 00:16:19,690
into fitness and gyms and so on.

283
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:24,460
What advice would you give them or
resources would you point them to, uh,

284
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,980
to increase the likelihood of success?

285
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:31,170
Yeah, I mean, one of the things I'd ask
them, and I could ask this often is,

286
00:16:31,171 --> 00:16:33,630
you know, hey, I want to open up a
gym. What do you think? I'm like, okay,

287
00:16:33,631 --> 00:16:37,110
well let's start with these three
simple questions, right? Number one,

288
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:39,660
are you qualified to do so?
Right?

289
00:16:39,661 --> 00:16:42,000
What makes you qualified
to open up this business?

290
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:45,210
Do you have an expertise in it?
Do you how?

291
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:49,890
How are you going to
basically give yourself this
competitive advantage that you

292
00:16:49,891 --> 00:16:53,010
know that when you go to open up,
you're going to win, right? Right.

293
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,240
What is your competitive, what's
the credibility, right? Yeah.

294
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:57,090
Just because you like to work out,

295
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:01,500
does it mean you should necessarily go
open up a gym? I love to eat, I love food,

296
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:03,930
but I sure as hell are not going to
open up a restaurant because I'm not

297
00:17:03,931 --> 00:17:06,420
qualified to do so. I don't have
the training, the expertise. Right,

298
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:08,630
and it's okay if you
don't in certain areas,

299
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,350
just go find an expert in those other
areas right there and ask of you is,

300
00:17:13,351 --> 00:17:17,490
you know the, are you doing it with a
strong intention is strong. Why? Right?

301
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:21,030
Like what is your why? Why do you want to
open this business? Is it to make money?

302
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:24,840
Because if it's just to make money,
just like competing at the crossfit games,

303
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,090
you didn't have a strong internal why?

304
00:17:27,091 --> 00:17:29,610
Because when your back's up against
the wall, it's very challenging.

305
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:31,710
You need to revert back to that.
Why?

306
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:35,640
To push through and in business
it's not always, you know,

307
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,680
rainbows and Unicorns,
right?

308
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:41,490
There's challenging times and senior to
be able to revert back to your internal

309
00:17:41,491 --> 00:17:44,460
why of why you started to be able
to do well. So I would say, hey,

310
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,080
how are you going to win? Right?
Tell me how you're going to win. Why?

311
00:17:47,081 --> 00:17:50,280
Why are you better than the other guy
down the street to do you have a strong

312
00:17:50,281 --> 00:17:52,560
reason why you want to open it?
And then three,

313
00:17:52,561 --> 00:17:54,420
is it a good time in
your life to do it right?

314
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:58,000
Is it a good time for you to open
it? Do you just have a baby? Um,

315
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:00,810
do you have tons of mortgages in
different types of stuff, right?

316
00:18:00,811 --> 00:18:03,090
Or is it a good time in your
life to go ahead and, you know,

317
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,730
go open up this business is
really what I like to ask people.

318
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:11,030
What are the most common mistakes that
you see or that you think you avoided?

319
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,380
Like if you look back at your business,

320
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,610
another way to phrase it so you can tackle
it however you want is what were some

321
00:18:17,611 --> 00:18:21,450
of the most important decisions
that you made? Looking back,

322
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:22,890
I think looking back,

323
00:18:22,891 --> 00:18:27,150
it was understanding that back in the
day you weren't going to make money off

324
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,980
your competitive fitness career.

325
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:33,180
And so I had to open up a business and
I had to open it and I think one of the

326
00:18:33,181 --> 00:18:36,000
best things I ever did was I recognize it,

327
00:18:36,001 --> 00:18:38,850
try and rob and steal as much as I can,
knowledge from people around me.

328
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:42,210
So when I was in high school, I worked
at the front desk at a conventional gym.

329
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:45,120
Then when I graduated high school,
I went to college,

330
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:48,510
I started working as a sales associate
there and I started making good money.

331
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:51,690
So as I'm going to a junior college,
you went to vast valley. Actually.

332
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:55,590
I was there and I, I just got woken
up like no one cares about me.

333
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:58,110
I was like the jock and I was like the,
you know,

334
00:18:58,111 --> 00:18:59,730
kind of like the class
clown in high school,

335
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:02,100
they'll have a sudden you get to college.
It's like they don't care about you.

336
00:19:02,101 --> 00:19:05,520
Right? So I really turned a
corner. I say, hey look, you know,

337
00:19:05,521 --> 00:19:07,770
I need to take responsibility
for what I need to get done.

338
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:11,160
I want to be successful. And so I
started going to school full time,

339
00:19:11,161 --> 00:19:15,570
working full time mode. I also did
was I learned how to talk to people.

340
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,010
I learned how to sell,

341
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:21,150
which was really important because in
my line of work in the fitness industry,

342
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,850
your coach and you're, you're talking
to people, you're coaching him.

343
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,040
But if you're a business owner,
you also need to learn how to sell.

344
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:28,980
But one of the things I would
also do is on the, you know, dot.

345
00:19:28,981 --> 00:19:33,090
Twice a week I would go and ride the
elliptical with the owner of the business

346
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:35,820
and I would just pick his brain,
understand what's going on.

347
00:19:35,821 --> 00:19:39,510
I think one of those things early on
was recognizing how wanting to learn

348
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:42,240
everything I could from his mistakes.
I didn't make as many.

349
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:47,550
And one of the things that we've done
a lot is delegate out things, right.

350
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,660
Not, you know, have enough of a
humbleness to be like, hey look,

351
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:55,440
I can't do everything best the
best I need to hire outside people.

352
00:19:55,441 --> 00:19:58,950
And I think I learned that early on
from him learning from him some of his

353
00:19:58,951 --> 00:20:03,000
mistakes. How did you convince
him to do the elliptical with you?

354
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:04,500
What was the pitch,
right? You were in sales.

355
00:20:04,501 --> 00:20:08,490
So how did you get the owner to hang
out with the former class clown on the

356
00:20:08,491 --> 00:20:12,720
elliptical? So funny enough he really took
me on as like a mentor. He really like,

357
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:15,960
he really mentored me really well and
he would ride the elliptical as part of

358
00:20:15,961 --> 00:20:17,160
his fitness routine routine.

359
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,920
And I would just go over there
and it just go meet with him.

360
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:23,070
And I don't think he disliked it because
we would just, you know, bullshit.

361
00:20:23,071 --> 00:20:23,881
Have good conversation.

362
00:20:23,881 --> 00:20:26,400
I think it kind of made the time
go by a little bit quicker. Got It.

363
00:20:26,401 --> 00:20:31,050
So you just roll up when he was working
at [inaudible] rolling. And, uh,

364
00:20:31,051 --> 00:20:33,210
when your back is against the wall,
you mentioned the why.

365
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:37,230
So when you were competing and say,

366
00:20:37,231 --> 00:20:40,380
this is actually a question that
came up at least once from, uh,

367
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,970
people who are listening to the podcast.
One wanted me to ask you what,

368
00:20:44,971 --> 00:20:48,990
why did you go back to when
you were competing in the
games? I mean at the time,

369
00:20:48,991 --> 00:20:49,860
right? Or, or

370
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,740
uh,
sorry to keep rephrasing my questions,

371
00:20:51,741 --> 00:20:54,200
but I've had too much
caffeine and that is uh,

372
00:20:55,320 --> 00:21:00,270
when you were say behind or you
saw someone gaining on you, uh,

373
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:05,330
the why or like what is the self talk
to make sure that you don't fall out of

374
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:10,680
that you don't drop the ball or otherwise
just get, get psyched out. Well,

375
00:21:10,681 --> 00:21:13,860
I think positive self talk is
a really hard thing to learn,

376
00:21:13,861 --> 00:21:17,430
but it's an important trait to
develop. And I've learned that, um,

377
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:20,770
over the years with a mindset
coach I work with where, you know,

378
00:21:20,771 --> 00:21:23,580
you try and find ways to reframe things
in your head if something's going wrong,

379
00:21:23,581 --> 00:21:25,680
instead of saying, oh,
my legs hurt, you say,

380
00:21:25,681 --> 00:21:28,440
hey folks on mid foot strike if
you're running or whatever. Right?

381
00:21:28,441 --> 00:21:31,830
You try and rephrase it in a positive
and reverting back to your why.

382
00:21:31,831 --> 00:21:34,230
I think it's really important
that going into these games,

383
00:21:34,231 --> 00:21:38,580
what I would do is I would tell myself
that I've made a commitment to myself,

384
00:21:38,581 --> 00:21:41,430
my family,
to go out there and do this.

385
00:21:41,431 --> 00:21:43,800
And I wanted to do it because I wanted to
get comfortable with the uncomfortable.

386
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:47,340
I wanted to see where I stack up against
my competitors and I wanted to do it

387
00:21:47,341 --> 00:21:51,240
for me. Right? And at the time I
didn't have as many other obligations.

388
00:21:51,241 --> 00:21:55,950
Now as life changes, right? Things
change. But at the time, my why was, hey,

389
00:21:55,951 --> 00:21:56,970
I made a commitment.
I'm gonna do this.

390
00:21:56,971 --> 00:22:00,360
And I remember one year we did
this camp Pendleton race and I was,

391
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:05,430
it's a 10 mile, just crazy Hilron and I
was like, halfway done. I just, you know,

392
00:22:05,431 --> 00:22:08,870
I'm like going through like this desert
and I look around, there's no one around.

393
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:09,840
I'm just like,
oh gosh,

394
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:13,140
and I see a translates to the
true story just walking across.

395
00:22:13,141 --> 00:22:16,020
I'm just looking at him like, what
the hell or a biggest spider? Maybe.

396
00:22:16,021 --> 00:22:19,530
It was interesting. It was big ass. I
was like, well, what am I doing out here?

397
00:22:19,531 --> 00:22:22,320
Right? And I had an instantly revert
back of my head. You know what?

398
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:25,830
I made a commitment. That commitment was
I was going to finish out these games,

399
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:29,040
so I bet her slap myself in the face,
stop being a wimp and finish it.

400
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:32,490
Because if I allowed myself to give in
and then what other things would I allow

401
00:22:32,491 --> 00:22:33,540
myself to give into?
Right?

402
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:36,390
I made a commitment to myself and
I wanted to live up to that. Now,

403
00:22:36,391 --> 00:22:39,000
over the years, because of other
things happened in my life,

404
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:41,220
I haven't been able to make
that strong of commitment.

405
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:45,210
So therefore I choose not even to go
out there and, and, and, and attempt

406
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:47,430
and the,

407
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:52,550
I'm very fascinated by these
little moments or days or weeks.

408
00:22:52,681 --> 00:22:56,070
It can really affect the complete
trajectory of people's lives.

409
00:22:56,071 --> 00:23:00,570
And you mentioned a couple of minutes ago,
you get to college age,

410
00:23:00,571 --> 00:23:05,070
you realize all right and no longer the
class clown in high school and you did a

411
00:23:05,071 --> 00:23:06,990
course correct, right? You
started going to school full time.

412
00:23:06,991 --> 00:23:10,320
So what triggered that?
Was it a particular conversation?

413
00:23:10,321 --> 00:23:14,940
Was it a particular afternoon?
What was it? So, you know,

414
00:23:14,941 --> 00:23:15,774
so

415
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:18,360
going out of high school,
I thought it was gonna play football at,

416
00:23:18,361 --> 00:23:22,640
ended up not working out. So I ended
up going to West Valley and you know,

417
00:23:22,641 --> 00:23:24,630
first day it wasn't that big
of a deal. Right. I get it.

418
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:27,380
I get there the first day I'm like, Oh,
I'm not West Valley and no big deal.

419
00:23:27,381 --> 00:23:28,940
I'll transfer another
school in a couple of years.

420
00:23:28,941 --> 00:23:31,100
But all my friends had gone to a
four year Santa Claire University,

421
00:23:31,101 --> 00:23:32,830
which is where I ended up graduating from.
Right.

422
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,270
But I just remember first day of school,

423
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,270
we're going round and we're all saying
our names, right? And it's like, Hey,

424
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:42,980
I'm John, this is my first, second
year. Hey, I'm Mary, this is my,

425
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,560
you know,
whatever second semester it is.

426
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:49,410
And then all of a sudden you have this
woman next to me and I kid you not write

427
00:23:49,411 --> 00:23:53,220
my first class on my first day
at West Valley and lady goes, hi,

428
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:58,680
my name is uh, Suzanne. I can't remember
the name exactly. She has that for a fact.

429
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,840
This is my seventh year at West Valley.

430
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:04,740
And I just remember looking at her and
looking at this teacher and just be like,

431
00:24:04,741 --> 00:24:09,000
dude, I gotta get my ass in check and
you'd get my shit together. Right.

432
00:24:09,001 --> 00:24:12,480
That's what I told myself. Right.
And so that moment I left there,

433
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:14,820
I went to the counselor's
opposite, said, hey, look,

434
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:17,160
I need to figure out the best way
to get the heck out of this school.

435
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:21,990
And so I ended up on taking full
class loads, do whenever I had to do.

436
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:26,220
I ended up applying to Santa Clara two
times after that and not being accepted

437
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,760
because I tried after one year,
I didn't get accepted.

438
00:24:28,761 --> 00:24:30,440
I tried for like a year and
a half getting to accepted.

439
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:35,180
Then after two years I was accepted,
which got me on track to graduate in four.

440
00:24:35,181 --> 00:24:38,660
So I graduated with all my peers, which
was great. I graduated my wife actually,

441
00:24:38,661 --> 00:24:40,080
which was really cool.
Um,

442
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:43,190
but that was the moment that really
like kinda sparked it. Like, dude,

443
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:46,460
like playtime's over high school's
done. It's, you're in the wheel rolled.

444
00:24:46,461 --> 00:24:48,770
No one really cares about you.
You better get your ass in check.

445
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:52,910
And when you applied, make me think of
Rudy a little bit. So you get, he applied,

446
00:24:52,911 --> 00:24:55,160
didn't get in, applied, didn't
get in and applied and got in.

447
00:24:56,180 --> 00:25:01,010
What did you change in between the not
getting accepted and getting accepted?

448
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:03,910
Well Matt had more courses
underneath my belt. Swag.

449
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:06,800
They didn't have to use my
high school GPA anymore. Right.

450
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,840
You're able to only you they call it,
you could use your trend,

451
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:12,040
your credits that would transfer.
That's right. Got It. All right, so,

452
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,800
so many questions,

453
00:25:13,801 --> 00:25:17,700
but I'm going to pull some in from
the audiences from fern Hernandez.

454
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:22,500
What are your thoughts on the frequency
of doing crossfit as another way?

455
00:25:22,501 --> 00:25:26,490
What benefits do you lose or gain from
doing say twice a week versus four to

456
00:25:26,491 --> 00:25:27,324
five times a week?

457
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,200
I mean,
I think by design,

458
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:33,850
when you look at it like a program and
if it's constantly varied by design,

459
00:25:33,851 --> 00:25:36,310
he should be able to do it, you know,
five days a week and you should be okay.

460
00:25:36,311 --> 00:25:40,000
If the programming is an appropriate in
the volume is good and you're listening

461
00:25:40,001 --> 00:25:42,970
to your body, you should be able
to perform that program, you know,

462
00:25:42,971 --> 00:25:45,580
five days a week because of the variance,
right?

463
00:25:45,581 --> 00:25:48,400
You should be able to go long
one day heavy one day, you know,

464
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,660
below parallel one day.

465
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,840
And that just depends on how much effort
people put into the program itself.

466
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:55,090
So two days is better than no days,

467
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:57,270
but two days also
challenging cause you go in,

468
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,560
you get really sore and then you're,

469
00:25:59,561 --> 00:26:02,350
you recover it and you get really sore
again and your body never gets into this

470
00:26:02,351 --> 00:26:05,440
rhythm. So assuming you go
to a gym as good programming,

471
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:07,540
I think you can go five days a week.

472
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:10,010
And you and I were also though,

473
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:14,030
just to touch on good programming in
the gym when we were messing around,

474
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:14,691
messing around,

475
00:26:14,691 --> 00:26:18,470
you were demonstrating backs while we're
talking about a five by five and so on

476
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:21,350
these five,
five sets of five reps and so on.

477
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:26,270
If the variance doesn't exist and
someone's trying to do five by five,

478
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,370
seven times a week with the squad.

479
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:33,120
Yeah, I mean you got, you got to have a
program that has variants, right? So we,

480
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:36,000
we do it at our gym and he's going to
have one person creates this template,

481
00:26:36,001 --> 00:26:36,561
the skeleton,

482
00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:39,870
and then he creates the workouts and
then we have a peer reviewed by six other

483
00:26:39,871 --> 00:26:42,240
of our coaches and then
it gets back to him.

484
00:26:42,241 --> 00:26:45,570
So we try to have a lot of and balances
our program because regardless of who's

485
00:26:45,571 --> 00:26:46,680
programming the program,

486
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:49,780
there's always going to be some type of
bias towards what you like. Sure. Yeah,

487
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:53,010
always. And so you need to have other
people have checks and balances on that.

488
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:56,370
How might someone create
a skeleton of a program?

489
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,880
And I'm not saying just Joe blow in the
street. I'm saying one of your coaches,

490
00:26:59,881 --> 00:27:02,010
right?
W what does that process look like?

491
00:27:02,011 --> 00:27:04,320
What are they thinking about or
considering as they do it? Well,

492
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:07,350
and I think they're looking
at time domains, right? So
you're looking at, you know,

493
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:10,410
are we talking five minutes? We talk
in 12 and as we talk in 20 minutes,

494
00:27:10,411 --> 00:27:13,860
we're talking in 30 or 40 minute
long workouts, total duration,

495
00:27:13,861 --> 00:27:17,790
total duration of the actual, you know,
rap email, whatever they're doing, right?

496
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:22,230
Things are look just for non crossfit
is as many rounds or reps as possible.

497
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,800
And then you know, you start talking
about in the skill work, right?

498
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,020
What is a theme for the month that
we tie in to develop someone's hand,

499
00:27:29,021 --> 00:27:32,040
Stan and we tried to, there's a lot
of things in play. It's, it's, it's a,

500
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:35,280
it's a challenging topic
to discuss briefly,

501
00:27:35,281 --> 00:27:40,080
but in theory it's hey, let's have
a, let's have some big macro goal,

502
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:42,750
right? Maybe it's to get everybody
ready for a five kids coming up.

503
00:27:42,751 --> 00:27:45,930
Maybe it's to get this skill of maybe
we start noticing that our gym members

504
00:27:45,931 --> 00:27:50,040
need benefit in x. Let's create that
macro goal. And then during our warm ups,

505
00:27:50,041 --> 00:27:52,080
make sure we touch base on
it several times a week.

506
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:55,470
Then let's have these other goals where
it's like we go heavy to three times a

507
00:27:55,471 --> 00:27:57,510
week, right? Then we go longer.

508
00:27:57,511 --> 00:28:00,690
Metcons are metabolic conditioning
workouts couple times a week,

509
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,150
and we add any short burst,
high intensity, one's a
couple times a week. So in,

510
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,120
in skeleton you want to think about,

511
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:09,600
you want to push you on to pull you
on a squat once a week, right? Um,

512
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:12,930
you want to incorporate the Olympic
lifts as you know, when you can.

513
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:16,320
And that's kind of the big picture
stuff. But you also, when you program,

514
00:28:16,321 --> 00:28:18,900
you want to think about kind
of this idea of, you know,

515
00:28:18,901 --> 00:28:20,160
if I'm programming workout,

516
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:22,170
I want to think about what's
going to keep people moving.

517
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:27,090
So you wouldn't want to do, for
example, uh, squats, lunges,

518
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:28,930
jumping here, squads, uh,

519
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,520
jumping lunges and what it was
like a bunch of whatever he's,

520
00:28:31,521 --> 00:28:34,530
what'll end up happening is people will
just burn out their legs and let us sit

521
00:28:34,531 --> 00:28:38,050
there and stand there until they can
recover. But now if you did, you know,

522
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:42,620
jumping lunges followed by
pushups, they're not the
same muscle Muslims, right?

523
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:44,820
They're different functions.
And so you can keep your body moving.

524
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:49,290
And as you mentioned, uh, when we were
chatting before recording just the audio,

525
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:54,710
the Olympic lifts generally would
come after say a familiarity,

526
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,900
at least familiarity,
maybe a mastery of the mechanics of say,

527
00:28:57,901 --> 00:29:01,800
power lifting movements and
some gymnastic components. Well,

528
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:04,560
I think we incorporate the
Olympic lifts early on. We do.

529
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,820
How do you do that safely?

530
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,250
I think it ultimately just comes down
to the coaches that are doing it right.

531
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,570
How do you,
you start off,

532
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,870
you make sure that people can do it right
with just the PVC pipe or a light bar

533
00:29:12,871 --> 00:29:13,800
and then you can work your way up.

534
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,620
But I think the difference is
that whereas with the power lifts,

535
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:20,580
it doesn't take as long to develop the,
all the techniques incorporated with it.

536
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,900
With the Olympic lifts it does.

537
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:25,380
And so you need to be okay with doing
the Olympic lifts early on, right?

538
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:26,850
Almost from the beginning.
It's okay,

539
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:31,680
but you need to do them at a moderate
controlled level verse the back's way.

540
00:29:31,681 --> 00:29:34,330
You can kind of push a little bit more.
I mean, you could push them all be,

541
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:36,150
don't want to push the
Olympic lifts so much.

542
00:29:36,151 --> 00:29:39,920
So the start developing bad habits and
the same thing applies to the backwash is

543
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:44,860
a little bit less. So the Olympic lifts a
little bit easier to Incor uh, you know,

544
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:46,460
they're, they're highly technical. Sure.

545
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:51,600
Let's just say you have average person
off the street or powerlifter comes in.

546
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,870
I want to learn Olympic weightlifting if
they have really bad thoracic mobility

547
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:59,530
and shoulder extension. Right?
So they're, they're here, right?

548
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:03,210
They can barely get there.
Their biceps past there.
They're yours. Do you have any,

549
00:30:03,211 --> 00:30:07,300
any favorite approaches to helping address
that or, or any suggestions? You know,

550
00:30:07,301 --> 00:30:10,720
our friend Kelly has some good
tools. Mobilitywod Riley start. Yeah.

551
00:30:10,721 --> 00:30:11,501
Kelly's threat.
I mean,

552
00:30:11,501 --> 00:30:14,800
I think that there's multiple different
things you could do but ultimately

553
00:30:14,801 --> 00:30:18,760
needed commit to it, right? I mean,
if you have poor, uh, you know,

554
00:30:18,761 --> 00:30:21,400
shoulder range of motion, it's going
to take you out to develop that.

555
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:25,600
And you know, that doesn't mean you
have to avoid all lifts all together,

556
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:30,120
still doing them. Just recognize you need
to put in the time, you know a couple,

557
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:34,510
you know, 10 20 minutes a day to develop
the range of motion and mobility.

558
00:30:34,511 --> 00:30:38,260
And the best way to do that
is by incorporating the
movements slow and control

559
00:30:38,261 --> 00:30:40,440
with light to little note no weight,
right?

560
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,190
If you want to really
develop a good squat,

561
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:46,180
try and work on the squat up against
the wall with no weight and work through

562
00:30:46,181 --> 00:30:48,610
the full range of motion of it up against
the wall. You mean facing the wall?

563
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,130
Yeah.
Question from Luke Campbell,

564
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:55,270
ask about his training with
former endurance athlete.
Now coach Chris Henshaw's.

565
00:30:55,271 --> 00:30:58,360
It was interesting to hear how a giant
like Jason could build his aerobic

566
00:30:58,361 --> 00:31:02,500
capacity without sacrificing size or
strength. How does he do it specifically?

567
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:06,430
That's a great question. Um, you
know, Hinshaw is great. You know,

568
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:09,760
years ago I started looking at summary
results from across the games and it

569
00:31:09,761 --> 00:31:13,870
would be like, you know, top 10 top 10 top
10 top 10 50th you know, top 10 top 10.

570
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:16,030
I'd be like, Oh boy, I got
a glaring weakness there.

571
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:19,630
And so I found Chris and he really helped
me out and he made running fun for me.

572
00:31:19,631 --> 00:31:23,310
He made running. Who is who? Who
is Chris? Just for [inaudible].

573
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:27,340
He's a local guy raise here out of
Palo Alto area yet. And he's a former,

574
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:30,700
you know, iron man triathlete.
Really successful but he,

575
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:34,390
but he has a unique way of making
running quantifiable and fun.

576
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,190
And what I mean by that is,
you know,

577
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:38,620
I'll go to the track and before I'd
just be like, oh run 400 meters.

578
00:31:38,621 --> 00:31:42,340
I would just like run it aimlessly. But
it felt good for him to give me, you know,

579
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,550
a hundred meter pace goals, 200
meter pays goals, et cetera.

580
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:48,880
And then those goals then
turn into something I could
really try and shoot for.

581
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:53,110
And I think going back to the whole thing
about someone going to the gym is for

582
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:55,360
those people who are interested
in doing running or doing types,

583
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:59,860
does having a program that kind of gives
you quantifiable numbers is shoot for,

584
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,030
I believe it's a great way,

585
00:32:01,031 --> 00:32:03,310
not only to get better results
but also to keep it more fun.

586
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,640
You don't need this go out for a five
k on your own. That's cool. I get it.

587
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:09,130
But you should start quantifying
what you're targeting,

588
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:11,380
the numbers are and your target paces.

589
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:13,480
And that's what I did with him and
that's why I was able to maintain those

590
00:32:13,481 --> 00:32:16,960
numbers.
When you were at your peak of of training,

591
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:22,290
what did your nutrition look like and
were there any goto supplements on top of

592
00:32:23,411 --> 00:32:23,531
that?

593
00:32:23,531 --> 00:32:27,430
It's a tricky sort of murky waters that
we get into sometimes and it's fine if,

594
00:32:27,431 --> 00:32:31,780
if any of them were sponsors, but if you
could just indicate which, which were,

595
00:32:31,781 --> 00:32:34,240
if that's the case,
but a diet.

596
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:38,080
So would your nutrition look like in
at the height of training and then any

597
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:40,070
particular supplements that
were kind of your go to?

598
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:45,350
So I never have and I until this day
eat as much as what most people probably

599
00:32:45,351 --> 00:32:49,460
think I eat. Um, but with the amount
of his training, sometimes, you know,

600
00:32:49,461 --> 00:32:52,610
just Broccoli and cauliflower weren't
cutting it for the carbohydrates I need to

601
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:55,550
do retain. So sweet potatoes had to
be thrown in and things like that.

602
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:58,760
I try to eat real food, right? I still do,

603
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:02,390
I try and eat real food and I try
and avoid excess amounts of sugar and

604
00:33:02,391 --> 00:33:03,081
different types of things.

605
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:05,780
But that doesn't mean that if my
daughter wants to go out and you know,

606
00:33:05,781 --> 00:33:07,380
if it's her birthday,
I'm not going to eat her birthday.

607
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:10,130
Kicking it and never has meant
that. Right. I'm okay with that.

608
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:15,050
I trained because at times I want to be
able to go and in and enjoy a, you know,

609
00:33:15,051 --> 00:33:18,890
a Margarita with my wife.
Right. That's okay. And it
always has been that same way,

610
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:22,010
whether I've been training at the
highest level or, or where I'm at today.

611
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:26,300
And you know, as far as recovery and I
partnered with a company called progenics.

612
00:33:26,301 --> 00:33:29,030
I think they make a good
recovery tool for me.

613
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:33,170
That's something I use outside of
that. Maybe some fish oil and, and,

614
00:33:33,171 --> 00:33:35,930
and that's pretty much the extent
of it, right? It's just real food.

615
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:40,931
I think people don't realize the value
you can get from just consuming real

616
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,170
regular food.

617
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:46,340
And did you track macros
and all that type of stuff?

618
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:49,560
Just know a lot of the guys at the
top don't really track all the macros.

619
00:33:49,561 --> 00:33:52,670
Some of them do, but not, not
a lot of the guys, you know,

620
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,930
a lot of them just work hard,
train hard and just eat appropriately.

621
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:01,130
All right. This is, this is
a question that I would love
to hear your thoughts on.

622
00:34:01,131 --> 00:34:02,330
This is from Lee Jackson.

623
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:07,040
What do you picture your workout
to be when you hit 60 years of age?

624
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:11,300
That is, I mean I think my workout is
gonna be roughly the way it is right now.

625
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:14,570
Just just basically scaled
down. Meaning you know, the,

626
00:34:14,571 --> 00:34:18,590
the demands that I have at, you know,
my age with, you know, my street.

627
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:21,760
Like we all need a squall, we only
oppressed. We only lift. So what are,

628
00:34:21,761 --> 00:34:25,490
I'm 60 30 50 I still want to
be doing those same movements.

629
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:28,730
I just might do it a little
bit of a less intensity. Right.

630
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:33,230
And even now being 31 the intensity
that can bring the workouts a little bit

631
00:34:33,231 --> 00:34:37,400
different than when I was 25 my body's
been beat up a lot by doing that and so I

632
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:40,280
just need to recognize it, listen to
my body and recover as well as I can.

633
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:43,250
But the amount of volume I'm putting
in isn't as much as it used to be.

634
00:34:43,251 --> 00:34:46,010
And I assume the time I'm 60 the
amount of volume I'm putting,

635
00:34:46,011 --> 00:34:47,960
it wouldn't be as much,
but the movements would be similar.

636
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:51,920
Is there any particular type of movement,

637
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:53,930
a conditioning strength,

638
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:59,000
fill in the blank that you'd really
like to work on and develop more now?

639
00:34:59,001 --> 00:35:02,600
In other words, you talked about
like top 10 top 10 top 10 50th place,

640
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:05,600
top 10 the top 10 are there any particular
weaknesses that you're trying to work

641
00:35:05,601 --> 00:35:07,760
on now? It doesn't have to
be limited to the gym either.

642
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:10,940
Like is there anything that you're there
they're working on currently? I mean,

643
00:35:10,941 --> 00:35:12,710
obviously, you know, I
like rolling Jujitsu.

644
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,990
There's a ton of things
get better at there.

645
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,570
But for me it's really on the business
side, on the family side, right?

646
00:35:17,571 --> 00:35:21,620
I'm trying to be the best dad I can be
the best husband I can be and I'm trying

647
00:35:21,621 --> 00:35:26,240
to support our business [inaudible] and
run it the best way possible and treat

648
00:35:26,241 --> 00:35:29,210
people that way. And that's what
I'm really focused on. You know,

649
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:32,570
stealing a line from Mark Cuban is just
the sport of business and I'm trying to

650
00:35:32,571 --> 00:35:35,540
win at that right now
for myself in particular.

651
00:35:35,541 --> 00:35:39,300
So that's what I'm focused on my fitness
side, I'm still hitting it all the time.

652
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:41,250
Right?
I still work out really hard,

653
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,880
but don't have any specific goals
other than just to maintain my fitness.

654
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:47,250
So this is,
this is actually a segue there.

655
00:35:47,251 --> 00:35:49,970
We're talking about family
a little bit and uh,

656
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,070
these were very highly uploaded.
So this,

657
00:35:53,071 --> 00:35:55,200
this is a question from Sherry Gall.

658
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,200
I've so admired him as an
athlete and businessmen,

659
00:35:58,201 --> 00:36:00,900
his work ethic and determination
to continue to improve,

660
00:36:00,901 --> 00:36:03,570
as well as his humility of pushed
him to great levels of success.

661
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:07,200
I've also watched his journey through
Ava's illness and seem him give back in

662
00:36:07,201 --> 00:36:10,710
the midst of it, blood drives, etc. I know
behind all of this is a good marriage.

663
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:13,110
I'd like him to talk about
marriage and how ava is doing.

664
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:16,020
I would also be fun to hear his
perspective on the evolution of the sport,

665
00:36:16,021 --> 00:36:18,030
but let's,
let's keep that separate.

666
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:23,450
Could you talk a little bit just about
the components of a good marriage and

667
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:27,190
also just tell us a little bit about
your, about your family and, and Ava.

668
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:31,020
A lot of people listening are going to be
familiar. Sure. Yeah. So my wife and I,

669
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:34,320
Ashley, we started dating
freshman year of high school,

670
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:39,000
so 1415 years old.
And we've been together almost ever since.

671
00:36:39,001 --> 00:36:41,820
What happened is we started dating
for a week, two weeks. Actually,

672
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:45,360
I thought we were in love, right? I went
home. I told her mom, I'm like, mom,

673
00:36:45,361 --> 00:36:49,260
I found a woman I'm gonna
marry. Right. And I was all
fired up. And then of course,

674
00:36:49,261 --> 00:36:52,620
two weeks later she dumps me
cause she said I was too nice.

675
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:58,890
Well, you know, a year
later, right. She knew,

676
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:01,170
she knew, you know, we
are meant to be together.

677
00:37:01,171 --> 00:37:03,360
So we ended up getting back
together again a year later.

678
00:37:03,361 --> 00:37:07,650
We haven't been separated since. Right. So
that was, you know, 15, 16 years old. And,

679
00:37:07,651 --> 00:37:11,070
um, so, you know, we went to college,
Graduate College together, did our thing.

680
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:16,200
We got married in 2009, uh,
had our first child in 2011,

681
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:19,770
Ava. And then we had our second
child. She has a 14. Kayden. Uh,

682
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:24,550
ava was diagnosed with
Leukemia January 21st, uh,

683
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:28,890
2016.
So about a little over a year ago.

684
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,500
And uh,
you know,

685
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:35,040
I think when you talk about what makes
a marriage successful, I think it,

686
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:37,680
it's an obviously a number of things.
You have to respect each other.

687
00:37:37,681 --> 00:37:38,820
You have to become best friends.

688
00:37:38,821 --> 00:37:43,170
You need to be able to be okay with
supporting each other on their journeys,

689
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,310
but you also need to, um,
align well on difficult times.

690
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:51,120
And I didn't know that until ava got sick.
You know, when you're in high school,

691
00:37:51,121 --> 00:37:53,880
you don't know how your wife is going
to react or girlfriend is going to react

692
00:37:53,881 --> 00:37:55,350
to a negative situation life.

693
00:37:55,351 --> 00:37:58,590
And I think what's really intriguing
about what happened to us is my wife and I

694
00:37:58,591 --> 00:38:02,340
and my family in general has gotten
a lot closer through Ava's diagnosis

695
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:06,530
primarily because she was so strong
and she still is. And that's the,

696
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:09,870
that's really exciting for me because
I take on like, Hey, you know,

697
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:11,730
we're going to get after this,
we're going to be successful.

698
00:38:11,731 --> 00:38:15,240
And she was the one who
really started that from the
beginning. You know, when we,

699
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:19,290
we first find out ava
had a leukemia, we, uh,

700
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,210
we were called the Er at Stanford Er.

701
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:23,960
Before that she was having a lot of
leg pain in different types of things.

702
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:28,560
It was, when did that start? How old was
she? Uh, so she, she right now she's five,

703
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:33,450
she'll be six in a month. You know,
it's, look, looking back on it now,

704
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:37,900
it probably, we probably have
identified the shit leukemia earlier,

705
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,770
but everything like had a reason
like sure shedding your infection.

706
00:38:41,771 --> 00:38:43,860
Then she had another one, then she
had another one and then you know,

707
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,510
the doctors are just the
worst ear infection I've
ever seen. We were like, wow,

708
00:38:46,511 --> 00:38:48,340
well her immune system
seems kind of suppressed.

709
00:38:48,341 --> 00:38:49,720
Like we didn't really think
about it. We're just like, oh,

710
00:38:49,721 --> 00:38:52,540
we'll just keep getting her medicine.
She has an ear infection. Then it's like,

711
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:57,070
oh my legs really hurt. I can't walk more
than a hundred feet without stopping.

712
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:01,180
Oh man, it must be growing beans. Let's
get you a trampoline was get you in a PT,

713
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:02,103
all these different things.

714
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:05,800
Then she started having bruising and
that's where we knew something was up and

715
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:06,790
so we're waiting for blood work.

716
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:10,600
We called it in the Er and when they
told us that night that she had leukemia,

717
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:14,630
he was at like 2:00 AM in the morning
and I should remember, you know,

718
00:39:14,631 --> 00:39:16,570
as he was a,
it was a very challenging time for us.

719
00:39:16,571 --> 00:39:19,840
And now I've had a lot of time to reflect
on it, so I'm a little less, you know,

720
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:21,340
uh,
you know,

721
00:39:21,341 --> 00:39:24,060
I used to talk about it as a lot harder
now that I've reflected on a lot,

722
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:27,400
it's a little bit easier to talk about,
but I just remember when I told my wife,

723
00:39:27,401 --> 00:39:29,410
you know, she just went out,
you know, we're, you know,

724
00:39:29,411 --> 00:39:33,460
I was crying and she just looks at me.
She's like, hey look, you tell our family,

725
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:37,330
uh, you know, tell her family,
let them know she has leukemia,

726
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:40,750
but just tell them that they want to cry.
They can crowd outside.

727
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,370
But as soon as he walked in the doors,

728
00:39:42,371 --> 00:39:45,520
they'd better be happy and they better
have a smile on their face or I'll stay,

729
00:39:45,521 --> 00:39:49,930
can't be let it. Right. And it was kind
of that mentality that was just like,

730
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:53,020
you know, Kinda like, you know,
she's just like, yeah, hell yeah,

731
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:55,390
we're going to crush this shit. And
then it made me realize like, oh yeah,

732
00:39:55,391 --> 00:39:59,320
we're going to crush it. Like it was
this very much so like football, like,

733
00:39:59,321 --> 00:39:59,531
you know,

734
00:39:59,531 --> 00:40:03,060
you're in the huddle and like you're in
the fight of your life and it's like, no,

735
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:04,450
no, we're going to
crush this thing. Right.

736
00:40:04,451 --> 00:40:08,620
And we've had that mentality ever since.
And you know, her strength has been,

737
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:11,230
has been awesome to see from a
marriage perspective. Right. So that's,

738
00:40:11,231 --> 00:40:15,160
that's a kind of a cool, cool thing to
find out about your spouse for sure.

739
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:20,140
What types of practices or routines,

740
00:40:20,141 --> 00:40:21,850
anything really,
uh,

741
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:27,040
do you have that helps the family
to be as cohesive as possible?

742
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:29,200
Well, I think we have a lot
of really good family support.

743
00:40:29,201 --> 00:40:31,900
So we've been super blessed. You know,
the night that my daughter was diagnosed,

744
00:40:31,901 --> 00:40:35,170
my mom and dad took my son
and took him for a month.

745
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:39,580
We were in the hospital for five
weeks. Right. Um, Lucille Packard,

746
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,390
they've done some really great things
for us. Um, but you know, like when,

747
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,850
when you see that family around and then
all of a sudden my father in law would

748
00:40:45,851 --> 00:40:48,610
be there every day my phone, I would just
be sitting in the waiting room, right?

749
00:40:48,611 --> 00:40:50,590
We didn't, we wouldn't call them when
doing it. You'd just be sitting there.

750
00:40:50,591 --> 00:40:54,310
And that family dynamic has been something
that's been really special to see.

751
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:58,390
And, uh, it's something that will
never, I'll never forget. And even now,

752
00:40:58,391 --> 00:41:02,290
here we are over a year later and we
still have a lot of challenging times and

753
00:41:02,291 --> 00:41:06,070
it's a family that helps us get through
all of it, right? Because my, for example,

754
00:41:06,071 --> 00:41:09,940
on Saturday, we were in Vegas, my mom
and dad helped watch our children set,

755
00:41:09,941 --> 00:41:12,160
my wife and I could go have
a night out to ourselves.

756
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:15,880
And those are really important things
in life to my wife and I since the

757
00:41:15,881 --> 00:41:18,520
beginning, I've always said, hey,
look, it's, we love our children,

758
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:22,360
but it's me and you first
for our relationships. If
our relationship isn't good,

759
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:24,760
then we're not gonna be able to
have a solid home for our children.

760
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,120
And so we've really tried to set aside
time to do date nights and do this and do

761
00:41:28,121 --> 00:41:29,380
that,
which has really been helpful,

762
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:32,170
especially during this time because
sometimes we have to have adult

763
00:41:32,171 --> 00:41:33,004
conversations.

764
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,900
Like right after this I'm going to
go see a counselor because you know,

765
00:41:35,901 --> 00:41:39,530
we need to get some support to help us
with this situation in my wife Ad have

766
00:41:39,531 --> 00:41:42,650
adult conversation about that
to go see a counselor. Yeah.

767
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:45,890
If you were giving advice to someone who,

768
00:41:45,891 --> 00:41:48,860
for instance just found out
their child is diagnosed with x,

769
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:54,070
some type of very intimidating disease
and they wanted any thoughts or advice

770
00:41:54,111 --> 00:41:57,200
from you whatsoever, like for
instance, what your wife said,

771
00:41:57,201 --> 00:42:01,190
which was you can cry but has to be
outside once you come in yet you have to

772
00:42:01,191 --> 00:42:03,410
have a smile on your face as it is there.

773
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:06,410
Is there anything else that you
wish that you'd share with them?

774
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:08,240
I think it's really important
to educate yourself,

775
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:10,730
educate yourself on the disease.
So my daughter has all,

776
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:15,590
it's a specific type of leukemia. Uh,
she's, uh, it's, it's a very treatable,

777
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:18,980
which is awesome, right? There's a
lot of them that aren't as treatable.

778
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,800
And my heart goes out to his families.
I mean,

779
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:26,300
you come sit in the oncology department
for a day with me and you'll just be

780
00:42:26,301 --> 00:42:30,080
humbled. So what I would say
to them is educate yourself.

781
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:32,660
We've had phenomenal health care,
phenomenal.

782
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:35,840
But there's been one or two times where
we've had to catch the doctors because

783
00:42:35,841 --> 00:42:38,810
sometimes, you know, they have other
things going on. But for me, there's no,

784
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,670
there's nothing else going on.
It's just this.

785
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,940
But I need to be able to educate myself
on it with all the different medications.

786
00:42:43,941 --> 00:42:46,400
What's going on here?
What is this one of the side effects?

787
00:42:46,401 --> 00:42:49,010
What should we be looking for?
Because those things are critical,

788
00:42:49,011 --> 00:42:49,821
especially for us.
I mean,

789
00:42:49,821 --> 00:42:54,760
we ended up in the ER probably once
every two weeks because of, um, uh, uh,

790
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:58,040
temperatures. But we have to be actively
engaged to take the temperature.

791
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,620
We had to be actively engaged on what the
side effects are of certain medicines.

792
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:02,270
I think that's the most critical pieces.

793
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:05,540
Educate yourself on what's going on
cause no one's going to care more than

794
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:08,540
you're going to care. This is going
to seem maybe like a gear shift,

795
00:43:08,541 --> 00:43:12,350
but I think it could be related.
When we were talking about transfer,

796
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:17,300
when we're in the gym earlier looking
at say modeling your pushup position so

797
00:43:17,301 --> 00:43:20,000
that it transfers to other movements.
Your elbows are flaring out,

798
00:43:20,001 --> 00:43:24,080
looking at deadlifting say first and
foremost and a conventional stance that it

799
00:43:24,081 --> 00:43:25,670
transfers more to and everything else.

800
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:29,650
You mentioned Amref
earlier the as many reps,

801
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:33,260
as many rounds as possible and you
mentioned an rep philosophy before I hit

802
00:43:33,261 --> 00:43:36,530
record and I was like, okay, I want to
come back to that. So what does that,

803
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:40,340
what does that mean?
Does it apply to areas outside of the gym?

804
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:43,130
So it's actually something
I've been working on for a
while and I've given talks

805
00:43:43,131 --> 00:43:47,330
about is called the Amorette mentality.
And to me it's the way that, you know,

806
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:50,090
I kind of live my life and
I'm trying to live my life.

807
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:53,630
And with the emirate mentality really
means is think about if someone said you,

808
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,330
Hey, I want you to do as
many pushups as you can in,

809
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:58,260
in a minute while you're doing and
you're just focused on that right now.

810
00:43:58,261 --> 00:44:00,260
Focus on anything else.
She's folks on the pushups.

811
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:03,920
And then when you're done with that, you
move on right now on podcasts with you.

812
00:44:03,921 --> 00:44:06,770
This one focused on, on, um,
am rapping with you right now.

813
00:44:06,771 --> 00:44:08,720
We're trying to do the
best we can together,

814
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:12,140
but what I'm not doing is on my phone.
Right?

815
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,900
And talking to you and trying to
work out at the same time. Right?

816
00:44:14,901 --> 00:44:19,280
I'm not doing that because, you know, I
think nowadays I would make the argument,

817
00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:23,000
I don't know if we're less productive
or more productive than we were 20 years

818
00:44:23,001 --> 00:44:26,750
ago because 20 years ago when you're at
work, you're working, when you're at home,

819
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:29,390
you're at home.
Now it's this huge carryover.

820
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:31,560
So what I found myself
doing for many years,

821
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:33,210
and I had to really knit
myself in the button,

822
00:44:33,211 --> 00:44:37,770
I still am trying to get a lot better
is I wouldn't be focused on my family,

823
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:40,080
are focused on what I was doing,
I'd be focusing on are things,

824
00:44:40,081 --> 00:44:43,020
there's times where I would go to dinner
and I would be having dinner with my

825
00:44:43,021 --> 00:44:45,360
wife and I wouldn't remember anything we
talked about cause I would be thinking

826
00:44:45,361 --> 00:44:47,880
about the crossfit competition
I had coming up. Right.

827
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:51,960
And that was an example of [inaudible]
am happy not being present and focused on

828
00:44:51,961 --> 00:44:55,980
what I was doing. So the theory
is you identify your focus, right?

829
00:44:55,981 --> 00:44:59,400
Whatever it may be, you know, for
me it's family fitness business,

830
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:02,610
then you work hard at it,
right? Whatever it may be.

831
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,270
Then you switch gears and you do this
throughout your day and then every now and

832
00:45:06,271 --> 00:45:08,280
then you need to reevaluate.
So I'll give you an example.

833
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:12,720
For a while I was going competing
at the highest level in crossfit,

834
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:16,360
owning the business. And I had the
family that I had more children in.

835
00:45:16,361 --> 00:45:18,630
The business grew and the
competition got harder.

836
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:22,680
So I decided to switch gears and go team
because I didn't have as much time to

837
00:45:22,681 --> 00:45:24,660
allocate to these other things.
So I had to switch gears,

838
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:27,300
evaluate what was really important to me,
and then do that.

839
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,100
But then when my daughter got sick,

840
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:33,390
it was another time for me to reevaluate
what am I trying to really focus on and

841
00:45:33,391 --> 00:45:35,160
how many things can I actually am rap.

842
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:40,380
So now I chose not to compete because I
want to do the best I can in business.

843
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:44,100
Then I want to switch gears and go best
I can with family and then I still want

844
00:45:44,101 --> 00:45:45,990
to work out,
but I can't spend as much time on it.

845
00:45:45,991 --> 00:45:48,780
And that's kind of the Amorite
mentalities. Identify her focus,

846
00:45:48,781 --> 00:45:52,860
work hard at it and switch gears and then
every now and then reevaluate and get

847
00:45:52,861 --> 00:45:55,920
rid of some of the stuff on your plate.
And when you're, when you're reevaluating,

848
00:45:57,030 --> 00:46:02,030
do you sit down with a pad
and a pen and write it out?

849
00:46:03,211 --> 00:46:03,660
Do you see,

850
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:06,600
do you have a set time when you might
do that in the morning or at night?

851
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:11,790
If you could just describe perhaps some
of the details of what that looks like.

852
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:12,511
I mean,

853
00:46:12,511 --> 00:46:16,740
reevaluating happens with big moments in
your life such as your daughter getting

854
00:46:16,741 --> 00:46:18,780
sick or you're getting
married or you have children,

855
00:46:18,781 --> 00:46:20,640
you have reevaluate with
the things you're going on.

856
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:23,430
You used to love maybe playing
video games for three hours a day.

857
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:26,100
Once you have a kidney reevaluate,
you can't do it anymore, right? You,

858
00:46:26,110 --> 00:46:29,190
you just can't, it, you need
to reevaluate those times.

859
00:46:29,191 --> 00:46:33,720
And so reevaluation happens kind of
internally for me. Uh, whether, um,

860
00:46:33,870 --> 00:46:37,550
you know, uh, on the bike,
just kind of like, you know,

861
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:40,070
thinking in my thoughts or
whatever it may be. But I, I,

862
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:43,560
I identify every so
often when I reevaluate,

863
00:46:43,561 --> 00:46:47,670
but on a consistent daily basis, I try
and check in with myself. I trust myself,

864
00:46:47,671 --> 00:46:52,260
hey, did I do the best job
today as I could to be a father,

865
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:57,000
to be a husband, to be a business
owner and did I maintain my fitness?

866
00:46:57,180 --> 00:47:00,660
Did I do that today? And if the
answer is yes, fuck hell yeah,

867
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:03,730
but if the answer's no, then
there's always tomorrow. Right? And,

868
00:47:03,731 --> 00:47:06,750
and I think if you do those
micro goals on a daily basis,

869
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:10,350
it doesn't lead to these oh shit moments
where you wake up and you've been doing

870
00:47:10,351 --> 00:47:12,960
the same thing for five years
and you're unhappy. Right?

871
00:47:12,961 --> 00:47:15,840
You need to start taking that into your
own hands on daily basis and really

872
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:20,100
evaluating what are some of your goals
right now from a business standpoint?

873
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:23,640
I mean, I just think that's service based.
Fitness is a way to go. I really do.

874
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:26,340
I feel very passionate about it. I think
that you would say, what does that mean?

875
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:28,890
You just service like you walk into a gym.
I want to be,

876
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:32,110
so once the want to help me, I want
their guidance and direction. You know,

877
00:47:32,111 --> 00:47:35,830
think about hotels. You go into a hotel,
gym, the four seasons everywhere else.

878
00:47:35,831 --> 00:47:38,590
It's like, hello sir, how can I help
you? This that you're going to the gym,

879
00:47:38,591 --> 00:47:39,424
there's no one there.

880
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:42,580
You just get on the elliptical and you
have an aimless workout. No direction,

881
00:47:42,581 --> 00:47:44,440
no guidance.
So from a business perspective,

882
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:46,600
I want to bring service to the hotels.

883
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:50,530
I want to bring service to corporate
wellness where instead of people is going

884
00:47:50,531 --> 00:47:52,750
to the gym and you know,
wearing their headphones.

885
00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:55,420
Now all of a sudden they're creating
connections and that helps with

886
00:47:55,421 --> 00:47:58,740
productivity in the workplace.
It creates with foster and his sense of,

887
00:47:58,741 --> 00:48:02,080
of more culture in that workplace
and then also wanting to that on the

888
00:48:03,310 --> 00:48:05,050
commercial side,
open to the public.

889
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:09,970
I want to be experts in the best
at service based fitness, right.

890
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Bringing the highest level of of of
quality coaching combined with quality

891
00:48:15,191 --> 00:48:18,840
programming in a fun atmosphere. That's
what we're really focused on right now.

892
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:23,500
This then, if we could rewind the clock,
this is from Pilar Eggman think it is.

893
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:27,910
If you, I mean it's Jason could go back
to 2008 after winning the crossfit games,

894
00:48:27,911 --> 00:48:32,911
what advice would you give yourself in
regards for training for the Games and or

895
00:48:33,301 --> 00:48:35,920
business? Yeah. What advice would you give

896
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,250
your self at that time?

897
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:40,410
It doesn't have to be actually related
to games. Business, I'd say, Eh,

898
00:48:40,430 --> 00:48:41,330
what advice period?

899
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:44,820
The advice I would say is earlier on
identify this whole concept of Mri

900
00:48:44,850 --> 00:48:48,890
mentality and evaluate more regularly
because there's times in my life that I,

901
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:53,750
that I regret not spending
quality time with. You know,

902
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:57,170
I mean I don't necessarily regret
cause he's got us where we're at today,

903
00:48:57,620 --> 00:49:00,740
but there's been times where I
haven't been the most present father.

904
00:49:00,741 --> 00:49:04,400
I've been doing a lot different things
and I wish I had learned that earlier on.

905
00:49:05,090 --> 00:49:07,870
At least now when I
travel or like the small,

906
00:49:07,871 --> 00:49:09,950
I left the house at four and I'm
not going to be home until later.

907
00:49:10,130 --> 00:49:14,650
At least now every time I do that I
recognize that it's a sacrifice I'm making

908
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:18,980
but that I have to except
it and then you know,

909
00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:20,790
try and make it right in the future.
Right.

910
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:23,430
But at least being aware
that there's sacrifice.

911
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:26,340
I think before it was just kinda
like I was trying to just do so much.

912
00:49:26,610 --> 00:49:30,150
Now I need to identify and say no to
more things so I could really start

913
00:49:30,151 --> 00:49:31,560
pinpointing my focus.

914
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:35,940
The question I had earlier about how
you go about doing that is still one I'd

915
00:49:35,941 --> 00:49:38,880
like to dig into a little bit cause I
think it's so important. For instance,

916
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:42,770
I was chatting a few months
ago with this older gent.

917
00:49:42,830 --> 00:49:47,830
He's in his sixties he has a couple of a
bunch of kids and every quarter he gets

918
00:49:48,351 --> 00:49:53,351
a report card from his wife and the
report card is a zero to 10 in four

919
00:49:55,081 --> 00:49:59,520
categories. He's got
provider, husband, father,

920
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:03,520
lover. Those are the
four. Wow. And he for,

921
00:50:03,521 --> 00:50:07,310
he owns his own company,
at least one company and travels a lot.

922
00:50:07,311 --> 00:50:08,270
So let's say he's traveling,

923
00:50:08,271 --> 00:50:12,050
but it's for business purposes and he's
opening up new manufacturing plants or

924
00:50:12,051 --> 00:50:15,020
whatever it might be in China. Who
knows? So he's gone. So he'll get,

925
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:17,330
he might get a 10 out of 10 and provider,

926
00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:21,860
but he's going to probably be very low on
the lover score and so on and so forth.

927
00:50:21,861 --> 00:50:22,041
You know,

928
00:50:22,041 --> 00:50:26,880
may five out of six on the others who
knows and it's allowable as long as he has

929
00:50:26,881 --> 00:50:27,830
a good average.

930
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:33,180
So it's like one can drop as long as
the others are higher and so on it,

931
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:38,260
how do you keep track
of reprioritizing or,

932
00:50:39,351 --> 00:50:40,790
or think about that?
Is it,

933
00:50:40,791 --> 00:50:45,500
is it all in the head or do you put it
down anywhere or is it something that you

934
00:50:45,501 --> 00:50:48,020
try to do at the end of each work day?
I know we talked about it a little bit.

935
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:51,380
Yeah, I think it's just in
my head. I think it's just
constant evaluation whether,

936
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:55,580
um, um, you know, I like to,
let's just say, you know,

937
00:50:55,581 --> 00:50:59,270
be alone with my thoughts and like in
the garage working out and I just think

938
00:50:59,271 --> 00:51:02,150
about, you know, hey, what am I doing
right now? What am I doing well,

939
00:51:02,151 --> 00:51:05,450
what can we do better at? How can I be
better at this, this, this, this, this,

940
00:51:05,451 --> 00:51:08,420
and it's just that constant pursuit
of being better at whatever I'm doing.

941
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:10,820
And I think it's an internal
conversation with myself.

942
00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:13,490
And I think that if I ever
get complacent or comfortable,

943
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,560
that's where I start getting nervous.

944
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:17,810
And I think I want to get
uncomfortable in business.

945
00:51:17,811 --> 00:51:20,780
I want to get uncomfortable and get out
there and start sharing my message of

946
00:51:20,781 --> 00:51:23,570
what I'm trying to do and what we're
trying to accomplish and provide for more

947
00:51:23,571 --> 00:51:25,070
people to do what they love for a living.

948
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:28,880
And these are the conversations
I have in my head, right, is hey,

949
00:51:29,290 --> 00:51:32,330
eva is getting better now. I can start
focusing a little bit more on this,

950
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:35,240
but don't forget about this,
you know, and things like that.

951
00:51:35,450 --> 00:51:39,920
Do you have any favorite books or books
that you've gifted to other people?

952
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:44,150
Either or both. The one that stands
out to me the most. I read a lot.

953
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:48,890
I think there's some really poor books
at the airport. I really do. Sure.

954
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:51,530
Anyways, for me, I like more
of a Pratt publication book.

955
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:54,830
I like a book like Mark
Cuban's sportive business.

956
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:56,510
I like it because it gets me fired up.

957
00:51:56,540 --> 00:52:00,560
I like it cause it's a real story from
a real guy just saying like it is and

958
00:52:00,561 --> 00:52:04,610
it's easy reading. It's not so
analytical and things like that. And uh,

959
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:06,200
so that's the look I like.
Got It.

960
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:11,390
Let's talk about morning rituals if you
have any. So this is from dot. S G no.

961
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:12,980
Or Sj,
excuse me.

962
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:18,020
What are some morning rituals
or reflections that he
does to keep passion alive

963
00:52:18,021 --> 00:52:20,390
while juggling children and
life's twists and turns?

964
00:52:20,450 --> 00:52:23,910
So I would say let's focus on the, on the
routines or rituals. Like do you have,

965
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:27,170
do you have any, if we look at
the first 90 minutes of your day,

966
00:52:27,171 --> 00:52:31,430
and I'm sure it varies, but generally
speaking, are there certain routines,

967
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,890
habits,
elements that you have?

968
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:37,100
I'd say in general it's probably
some type of exercise in general.

969
00:52:37,130 --> 00:52:40,340
There's exceptions to that, right?
But in general it's exercise,

970
00:52:40,341 --> 00:52:44,450
whether it be Jujitsu or you know,
hitting it in my garage, whatever it is.

971
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:47,510
I like to get the body moving and I like
to get flowing early in the morning.

972
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:51,620
Do you do that before breakfast? After
breakfast. Before, before breakfast.

973
00:52:51,890 --> 00:52:53,420
So that's before the kids get up.

974
00:52:53,421 --> 00:52:56,840
That's before my wife is up
as before everything that,

975
00:52:56,841 --> 00:53:00,470
what time is that typically would
you say? I mean it varies. You know,

976
00:53:00,471 --> 00:53:03,260
used to be a lot earlier.
Now it's like, I mean,

977
00:53:03,290 --> 00:53:05,210
well this morning I left
early yesterday I left early,

978
00:53:05,211 --> 00:53:09,200
but on average it's probably
six, six. Yeah, because some
days it's a lot earlier.

979
00:53:09,201 --> 00:53:12,200
Sundays is seven. And you're
exercising on an empty stomach. Yeah.

980
00:53:12,470 --> 00:53:14,990
Did you drink coffee? I do. I love coffee.

981
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:18,710
Do you drink coffee before your workout?
Would you say that for later?

982
00:53:18,711 --> 00:53:22,400
How many cups of coffee do you have a
day? Um, I probably have one and a half.

983
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:27,180
Okay. To maybe modern.
Maybe. I love coffee. Um,

984
00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:30,570
what I'll do is normally exercise, come
in, see the kids. I'll make my coffee,

985
00:53:30,571 --> 00:53:33,150
like doing pour overs. I want to
get a really cool espresso machine.

986
00:53:33,151 --> 00:53:36,540
That's what I'm working on next. Um,
and you know, hanging out with the kids,

987
00:53:36,541 --> 00:53:39,610
they get breakfast, boom, they go off
to school and I go off to work and uh,

988
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:42,620
we do our thing and then
I'll be there and I'll, you,

989
00:53:42,670 --> 00:53:44,490
I'll go to meetings or
go to different gyms.

990
00:53:44,491 --> 00:53:48,580
I'll try and just see what's going on.
Then sometimes I'll do, uh, you know,

991
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:53,230
workout. I'll take one of
our classes right throughout
the bay area. And then, um,

992
00:53:53,310 --> 00:53:56,850
I'm always home for dinner
at five 30 with the family.

993
00:53:57,030 --> 00:54:00,090
And then I get back on emails and
different stuff around seven, eight, uh,

994
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:04,350
around seven 30 till about 10 when
the key, because the kids go to sleep.

995
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:07,740
So basically his regiment, my day is
like, it's exercise, get the body moving,

996
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:12,000
it's time with the family briefly in the
morning, they go to school, I go to work.

997
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:15,390
Then when I get home at five
30, we have dinner, we hang out.

998
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:18,840
Then for the rest of the night
I'm doing work and I go to bed.

999
00:54:18,841 --> 00:54:22,980
I check my bed by 10 30, 10, 10,
30, and then do it all over again.

1000
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:25,590
Do you have any particular,
and maybe this doesn't happen to you,

1001
00:54:25,591 --> 00:54:28,080
but when you have so many different hats,
right?

1002
00:54:28,081 --> 00:54:32,550
I mean you have your business
owner, father, husband, uh,

1003
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:34,760
certainly competitor make,

1004
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:38,160
perhaps not going into
the games necessarily,

1005
00:54:38,161 --> 00:54:41,040
but still you have extreme athletic drive.

1006
00:54:41,310 --> 00:54:43,080
Do you have insomnia or do
you find it easy to sleep?

1007
00:54:43,081 --> 00:54:46,170
Do you ever have insomnia or you, so I
find it pretty easy to sleep, you know,

1008
00:54:46,171 --> 00:54:49,830
you'd think with, with the different
stresses I have, uh, I, no,

1009
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:52,530
I think it's because I exhaust
myself throughout the day. Right.

1010
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:56,570
I generally run it a high, like some
people say it's like the, the um,

1011
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,410
full throttle or like,
you know,

1012
00:54:58,411 --> 00:55:02,460
like I generally run on a high level
throughout the duration of the day.

1013
00:55:02,610 --> 00:55:03,700
Kind of like a kid,
you know,

1014
00:55:03,701 --> 00:55:06,710
it's like [inaudible] and then all
of a sudden they get to you like,

1015
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:09,840
like a bedtime.
It's like you just don't happen to me.

1016
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:13,140
You definitely have a
sort of high standard Rpm,

1017
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:15,293
which is good.

1018
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:20,040
Do you have any wind down routines or
anything you'd like to do before bed?

1019
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:21,110
I mean,
generally it's,

1020
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:24,030
it's answering a lot of emails because
during the day I'm doing a lot of other

1021
00:55:24,031 --> 00:55:26,160
stuff is dancing, a lot of
emails, getting back to people.

1022
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,800
And then sometimes my wife and I,
we'll watch a show together.

1023
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:32,550
But that's pretty much it. That's it.
And then Facebook and then face plant.

1024
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:34,680
And on the weekends I'm like,
you know, we like to travel,

1025
00:55:34,681 --> 00:55:37,740
we like to go do things like last
weekend or this week can come up,

1026
00:55:37,741 --> 00:55:39,960
we're going to Disneyland
with my daughter. And uh,

1027
00:55:40,290 --> 00:55:42,780
that weekend after we're going to Mexico
to see one of our locations balls have

1028
00:55:42,781 --> 00:55:46,860
a good time. So we try and travel
as a family and have those times.

1029
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:50,130
Who Do you go to for business advice?
And I got a few. I mean, you know,

1030
00:55:50,131 --> 00:55:54,630
we have a few mentors have really helped
out some of our corporate partners.

1031
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:55,980
Western digital is one of them.

1032
00:55:56,190 --> 00:56:00,750
Some executives in there have really
been amazingly helpful just in asking you

1033
00:56:00,751 --> 00:56:04,380
about things. Because for me and my
industry, sometimes I get overwhelmed.

1034
00:56:04,530 --> 00:56:07,860
So I need to get outside. My industries
are asking what's going on. And you know,

1035
00:56:07,861 --> 00:56:11,370
I have also friends through different
sponsorships that I have that they really

1036
00:56:11,371 --> 00:56:15,000
helped me out from, you know,
Paul and I have a lot of people.

1037
00:56:15,001 --> 00:56:18,660
And then in the beginning,
who would they? Paul Gomez.

1038
00:56:18,661 --> 00:56:23,010
It's got my core Donohoe
Jerry. Um, and then Joe Jagan
Tino back in the day. Right.

1039
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:26,200
Was like the original guy that really
kind of took me under his wings from a

1040
00:56:26,201 --> 00:56:27,460
business perspective.
And then this guy,

1041
00:56:27,461 --> 00:56:31,750
men taught me everything to do with
sales. Okay. So wait, so as Joe,

1042
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:34,210
the fellow on the elliptical. Yup. Josie,

1043
00:56:34,211 --> 00:56:37,840
elliptical and men was guy who
came over on a ship from Vietnam,

1044
00:56:38,210 --> 00:56:40,180
got in a concentration camp in uh,

1045
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:43,780
I want to say like career something and
ended up getting here selling perfume

1046
00:56:43,781 --> 00:56:47,710
door to door. And now he's doing really
well for himself. So straight up hustling.

1047
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:48,610
How did you meet men?

1048
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:52,270
He was the gym sales guy and I wanted
to be like him because he was making big

1049
00:56:52,271 --> 00:56:52,690
checks.

1050
00:56:52,690 --> 00:56:57,400
So you met him at the same time that you
were also later doing the elliptical?

1051
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:00,670
Yeah, mentoring sessions
happening. How ambushing him.

1052
00:57:00,870 --> 00:57:04,660
I was working the front desk and so
men would put in his sales slips and I

1053
00:57:04,661 --> 00:57:07,240
looked at his commission slips and
I was like, dude, what's going on?

1054
00:57:07,450 --> 00:57:09,160
Teach me how to sell.
And he did.

1055
00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:12,910
And that was really a cool experience
because I learned at a talk to different

1056
00:57:12,911 --> 00:57:16,090
people, identify what their wants
and needs were and you know,

1057
00:57:16,091 --> 00:57:16,601
see what's going on.

1058
00:57:16,601 --> 00:57:19,480
But it was also a time of my life where
I started recognize that you need to run

1059
00:57:19,481 --> 00:57:22,000
an ethical business just
because you make money.

1060
00:57:22,001 --> 00:57:25,240
Making money is not everything in life.
Running a very ethical,

1061
00:57:25,241 --> 00:57:26,980
successful businesses critical for me.

1062
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:30,280
And what would happen is I would
sell them the dream like, Hey,

1063
00:57:30,281 --> 00:57:32,500
join our gym for nine, nine
nine a month. And you know,

1064
00:57:32,590 --> 00:57:34,510
you're getting the best shape
of your life, but they wouldn't.

1065
00:57:34,570 --> 00:57:36,280
And I knew I was selling
them a false hope.

1066
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:40,630
And so that's when I got into the kind
of like the Group, uh, coaching style,

1067
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:45,490
which just changed the game for me. I want
to talk about two, two pieces of that.

1068
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:49,060
What made been so good at selling?
I mean,

1069
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:52,270
the best way to describe him as a
straight up hustler. I mean just,

1070
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:53,910
just hustling like right.

1071
00:57:55,170 --> 00:57:57,580
But for some people that's going to
conjure the image of like some guy with a

1072
00:57:57,581 --> 00:57:59,050
foldout table and three card Monte.

1073
00:57:59,051 --> 00:58:01,800
He was like picks up and runs away
from the cops when the siren, sorry.

1074
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:04,480
He lived by the code, you
know, abcs always be closing.

1075
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:08,440
Huges identify what someone needed to
hear and he would work really hard at

1076
00:58:08,441 --> 00:58:11,920
doing it and there was no sugarcoating.
He would follow up with people.

1077
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:12,880
You would tour people.

1078
00:58:12,881 --> 00:58:17,500
Well he showed me from an early age
that there's no easy answer in life.

1079
00:58:17,501 --> 00:58:20,230
You've got to put in the work and you've
got to get on the phones and hustle it

1080
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:21,670
and you want to,
you want to get leads,

1081
00:58:21,970 --> 00:58:25,090
go to the collections who like
all the members who are past due,

1082
00:58:25,410 --> 00:58:26,800
call them all and try and collect it.

1083
00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:31,420
Go back to people who visited the gym
from five years. Go and call them.

1084
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:34,630
And I would just end it with stacks, be
on the phone that Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah,

1085
00:58:34,631 --> 00:58:38,620
Dah, Dah, Dah. You got, maybe you
get one. What's the, uh, so what,

1086
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:43,680
what would be an example of say and a
potentially successful script or question

1087
00:58:43,930 --> 00:58:44,291
when you're,

1088
00:58:44,291 --> 00:58:48,250
when you're calling up the Glengarry
leads that you have from five years ago,

1089
00:58:48,810 --> 00:58:52,990
what, what, what does a good call
look like if you were you, if you,

1090
00:58:52,991 --> 00:58:55,900
if someone in your company had
that job today and you're like,

1091
00:58:56,170 --> 00:58:59,710
here's a stack that have starts smiling
and dialing, what would you tell them?

1092
00:59:00,010 --> 00:59:01,990
I mean, I think you start off
just saying, Hey, I'm, you know,

1093
00:59:01,991 --> 00:59:05,110
I'm Jason [inaudible] with NC fit. Uh,
I just want to follow up with your,

1094
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:08,980
you know, whatever. Um, I
think really what you would
try and do is just identify,

1095
00:59:08,981 --> 00:59:12,610
hey, so you know, you know, how has
your experience, we're just checking up.

1096
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:15,910
Did you enjoy your experience? What were
you looking for out of your experience?

1097
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:19,210
And you identify with they're looking
for, right? And they say, Oh, well,

1098
00:59:19,211 --> 00:59:22,400
did you hear that? We actually
just added program that, you know,

1099
00:59:22,401 --> 00:59:24,110
kind of tailors to what
they were looking for.

1100
00:59:24,111 --> 00:59:26,240
And I think finding out
what people are looking for,

1101
00:59:26,241 --> 00:59:27,021
I think it's really important.

1102
00:59:27,021 --> 00:59:29,420
Instead of trying to force
feed what you think they want,

1103
00:59:29,690 --> 00:59:33,890
find out what they do want. Asking
good questions. What's, what's,

1104
00:59:33,891 --> 00:59:38,300
what are the magic ingredients to a good
tour? He said men toward, well, oh man,

1105
00:59:38,330 --> 00:59:40,640
he had toward the best,
you know, you know,

1106
00:59:40,641 --> 00:59:44,420
to some people just be treadmills
and ellipticals, but to him it was,

1107
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:49,040
it was money making pieces of
machinery that you could sell. Hey,

1108
00:59:49,070 --> 00:59:50,220
this is the,
you know,

1109
00:59:50,570 --> 00:59:55,520
lifestyle 10 32 top of its class.

1110
00:59:55,850 --> 00:59:58,820
It comes to the fan. It
seems music to you, right?

1111
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:03,230
And you just like selling a Mercedes
and then you'd talk about the treadmill.

1112
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:07,550
You talk about this and that. Oh by the
way, let me show you downstairs. Did we,

1113
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:10,790
you know, and then finally get
down to the DA. And it's like, oh,

1114
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:14,300
did we tell you though that you could,
for an additional $8 a month,

1115
01:00:14,301 --> 01:00:16,700
you can get teleservice and let
me show you where those towels go.

1116
01:00:16,710 --> 01:00:19,250
Let me show you what they look like and
let me show you the quality of them.

1117
01:00:19,250 --> 01:00:21,410
Right. And those are the types
of things that you learn, right?

1118
01:00:21,411 --> 01:00:25,520
It's just if you have a, did he have
a strong accent or no. Oh yeah. No,

1119
01:00:25,521 --> 01:00:28,460
that's great though because it just
shows you like it does not matter.

1120
01:00:28,490 --> 01:00:31,520
You're very strong views. No,
nobody powered through it. I mean,

1121
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:34,220
I used to live in San Jose
and, and uh, you know,

1122
01:00:34,270 --> 01:00:37,130
used to go to a Vietnamese
barbershop and it's,

1123
01:00:37,131 --> 01:00:41,460
it's one of my best friends growing up was
Vietnamese on long island. And I, when,

1124
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:44,240
when anyone has a strong accent,
it's a heart. It's a strong accent.

1125
01:00:44,241 --> 01:00:49,241
But he was able despite that to just
power through and become one of the top,

1126
01:00:49,401 --> 01:00:53,480
if not the top. Oh, it was, he was a
dude. Oh yeah, he was, he was a baller.

1127
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:58,220
I learned a lot from him.
All right.

1128
01:00:58,221 --> 01:01:01,060
I'm going to ask just a few more questions
and then maybe we can do around two

1129
01:01:01,070 --> 01:01:04,180
sometimes since we're basically in
the same, same neighborhood. Uh,

1130
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:07,760
one would be if you could put
any message on a billboard,

1131
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:09,260
and this is a metaphor really,

1132
01:01:09,261 --> 01:01:12,320
but just to get a message
out to millions of people,

1133
01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:15,470
let's assume it's noncommercial,
right? So it can't be an advertisement,

1134
01:01:16,010 --> 01:01:19,280
but what might you put on a billboard?
I mean I would,

1135
01:01:19,850 --> 01:01:22,940
I would love to get this out to as many
people as you could possibly push us too.

1136
01:01:23,690 --> 01:01:26,540
It would just say like be easy.

1137
01:01:28,010 --> 01:01:29,690
It's like life is good.

1138
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:34,990
And I mean that because I really believe
that meaning when you seen children,

1139
01:01:36,290 --> 01:01:38,870
you know, when you seen
children, oncology,

1140
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:41,390
it changes your whole perspective.

1141
01:01:41,690 --> 01:01:45,200
Yesterday I was on the road and this
woman is just tailing me so hard coming

1142
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:49,460
around, get all crazy. I just look
over at her. I'm just like easy, easy,

1143
01:01:49,461 --> 01:01:51,980
like life is good.
You have a beautiful car,

1144
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:56,180
you look healthy and young
and pretty whatever. Like
chill the hell out. You know?

1145
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:57,530
And I think people,

1146
01:01:57,531 --> 01:02:01,850
they get so caught up in these little
problems and he let it manifest into

1147
01:02:01,851 --> 01:02:05,780
something so great that they stopped to,
they never stopped reflect that,

1148
01:02:05,781 --> 01:02:10,190
hey look, life is okay. But I,
I choose to look at the world.

1149
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:15,020
Me Personally, I choose, look at the world
in a pair of glasses, not sunglasses.

1150
01:02:15,021 --> 01:02:19,020
I choose to look at things in a brighter
light because especially after you,

1151
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:21,930
I spent three nights in the ICU and I,

1152
01:02:21,990 --> 01:02:26,640
my daughter was on the brink of not good.
You know,

1153
01:02:26,641 --> 01:02:28,980
you don't go to the ICU as a cancer
patient. I mean it was really,

1154
01:02:28,981 --> 01:02:30,030
really not good.
Right.

1155
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:32,760
It was the only time that we really felt
like it was a life and death situation.

1156
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:37,470
I'm sitting there and there's this baby
to my left and he's seven months old and

1157
01:02:37,471 --> 01:02:38,340
his dad comes in.

1158
01:02:38,850 --> 01:02:43,030
The baby had never left the ICU before
and all night they were there were

1159
01:02:43,031 --> 01:02:47,040
sucking fluid out of this
kid's lung because he had
pneumonia or whatever it was.

1160
01:02:47,490 --> 01:02:51,090
And I'm sitting there for
two days straight, right up
all night eating muffins,

1161
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:55,030
looking at my daughter over here,
like really not in good shape.

1162
01:02:56,060 --> 01:02:58,910
And this guy or this baby over here in
the dead, I'm just sitting there like,

1163
01:02:59,580 --> 01:03:03,360
and people are complaining that there's
traffic and fucking plane and it's just,

1164
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:07,560
no, I'm not expecting people. I never want
anybody to be in our position. I don't.

1165
01:03:07,860 --> 01:03:10,530
But what I want you to do is to really
reflect on their life and realize that

1166
01:03:10,531 --> 01:03:13,200
everybody has something to be grateful
for. If you think about it, right,

1167
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:14,400
you're alive,
you're well,

1168
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:18,070
you have the ability to get up and go do
some amazing things, you know? And, uh, I,

1169
01:03:18,071 --> 01:03:20,700
I think that sometimes people get
caught up and they forget that.

1170
01:03:21,220 --> 01:03:22,690
I think they could use a reminder of that.

1171
01:03:23,170 --> 01:03:27,950
Yes. I think that is where, shoot,
we should wrap up. That is, uh,

1172
01:03:28,060 --> 01:03:33,010
I think that is if among many other
things, what I want people to remember.

1173
01:03:33,070 --> 01:03:37,660
So that's a, that's a fantastic
point. And just in closing,

1174
01:03:37,661 --> 01:03:41,050
where can people find you online,
learn more about you,

1175
01:03:41,051 --> 01:03:43,330
learn more about your
business and, and, and

1176
01:03:43,390 --> 01:03:48,010
anything else you'd like them
to take a look at? Yeah, I
mean, I, uh, NC fit right?

1177
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:52,920
nc.fit would be great. Um, I'm very
active on Instagram. Jason Cleave, uh, um,

1178
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:57,430
I don't use Facebook as much.
I probably should. In Twitter,
I leave a k, h, k, h, a, l.

1179
01:03:57,431 --> 01:04:00,280
I, p, h. And. M. You know, I do
these things called box of business.

affiliate owners or, or gym owners.

1181

My partner and I had JP. We do, I'm all
for charity and pediatric cancer. And so,

1182
01:04:07,871 --> 01:04:11,320
you know, back to one of the questions,
we have a blood drive cut up in September.

1183
01:04:11,830 --> 01:04:14,980
We do that on a nationwide scale at
different crossfit gyms around the world,

1184
01:04:15,010 --> 01:04:18,100
just to place it since people who might
be listening five years from now as it's

1185
01:04:18,101 --> 01:04:22,350
2017. Okay, good. We're gonna do it on a
yearly basis. Oh, you are? Okay. Go. Yeah.

this is five bullet Friday.
Do you want to get a short email from me?

1208
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:42,160
Would you enjoy getting a short email
from me every Friday that provides a

1209
01:05:42,161 --> 01:05:45,700
little more soul of fun before the
weekend and five bullet Friday is a very

1210
01:05:45,701 --> 01:05:50,050
short email where I share the coolest
things I've found or that I've been

1211
01:05:50,051 --> 01:05:51,340
pondering over the week.

1212
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:54,340
That could include favorite new
albums that I've discovered.

1213
01:05:54,341 --> 01:05:57,790
It could include Gizmos and gadgets
and all sorts of weird shit that I've

1214
01:05:57,791 --> 01:06:02,110
somehow dug up in the, uh, the
world of the esoteric as I do.

1215
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:07,380
It could include favorite articles that
I've read and that I've shared with my

1216
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:10,780
close friends for instance,
and it's very short.

1217
01:06:10,870 --> 01:06:15,850

1243

Tell use them personally. Ever since
I wrote the four hour work week,

1244
01:07:57,700 --> 01:08:01,780
I've been asked over and over again
how I choose to delegate tasks,

1245
01:08:02,020 --> 01:08:04,720
how I do 80 20 analysis and so on.

1246
01:08:04,990 --> 01:08:08,920
At the root of many of those decisions
is a simple question. Actually.

1247
01:08:08,921 --> 01:08:12,730
Two questions. Number one,
how can I invest money to
improve my quality of life?

1248
01:08:12,790 --> 01:08:14,440
I use that in investing as well.

1249
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:19,920
The how can I spend a little money or
moderate money to save significant time

1250
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:22,730
inc tell is one of those investments.

1251
01:08:22,820 --> 01:08:26,840
They're a turnkey solution for all of
your imaginable customer care needs.

1252
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:31,070
I used eight tell during the launch
of the four hour body which was very,

1253
01:08:31,071 --> 01:08:35,450
very involved and they provided 24
seven customer service for my land rush

1254
01:08:35,451 --> 01:08:40,040
campaign because it was critical for
me to take care of every person who

1255
01:08:40,041 --> 01:08:43,850
purchased my books and participating in
this allowed me to focus on the things

1256
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:45,470
that I am better at.

1257
01:08:45,471 --> 01:08:49,610
My strengths like the marketing plan
that we'd worked on for six months,

1258
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:52,700
implementing that until
trains their experience.

1259
01:08:52,701 --> 01:08:56,690
Customer service reps to
know your business and your
products inside and out and

1260
01:08:56,691 --> 01:08:58,610
make your customers raving fans.

1261
01:08:58,670 --> 01:09:02,750
They answer more than a million customer
service requests every year and they

1262
01:09:02,751 --> 01:09:07,490
can do so across all platforms including
email, phone, social media, text.

1263
01:09:07,750 --> 01:09:12,750
You can chat leaving your customers with
whore service or just mediocre service,

1264
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:16,850
which by the way,
in a competitive pool is a huge liability.

1265
01:09:16,851 --> 01:09:21,851
Long wait times are unanswered messages
carries a massive cost and risk to your

1266
01:09:22,581 --> 01:09:23,430
business.
Uh,

1267
01:09:23,690 --> 01:09:27,770
Intel removes the logistics and
headaches of this type of communication,

1268
01:09:27,771 --> 01:09:31,850
allowing you to focus on your
strengths and grow your business.

1269
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:34,610
It can be a real competitive advantage.
And I see many,

1270
01:09:34,611 --> 01:09:39,611
many ecommerce companies
and tech companies thinking
of customer service as a

1271
01:09:39,830 --> 01:09:42,680
good enough checkbox or an afterthought,

1272
01:09:42,980 --> 01:09:47,980
and it just like airbnb use design and
innovative ways to be a competitor and to

1273
01:09:49,881 --> 01:09:52,250
win that. You can do the same
thing with customer service.

1274
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:54,590
