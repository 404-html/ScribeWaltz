1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,830
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02,831 --> 00:00:06,530
I can run flat out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking it.

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,440
I'm a cybernetic organism living tissue.

4
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,500
This episode is brought
to you by a cent protein,

5
00:00:26,501 --> 00:00:31,501
the cleanest least processed protein
I've ever consumed and I have tried just

6
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:35,170
about everything since well
before the four hour body.

7
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:38,830
I've started my day with
20 to 30 grams of protein.

8
00:00:38,831 --> 00:00:40,870
First thing that has
been part of my routine,

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:45,610
but I don't always have the time or
necessarily the desire to cook an entire

10
00:00:45,611 --> 00:00:47,200
meal.
So what to do.

11
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:52,120
Protein powders can be a fast way
to get this protein needs met,

12
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:56,350
but most products are full of crap.
They're bleached, they have excess sugar,

13
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:00,250
terrible artificial sweeteners or
just straightforward low grade,

14
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,420
low quality protein.

15
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:06,990
Ascent contains zero artificial
ingredients and the parent
company is actually a

16
00:01:07,121 --> 00:01:11,620
cheese manufacturer so that they
produce their own native proteins.

17
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:12,700
It's,

18
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,690
it's really fascinating and I've looked
at they're processing it takes or it

19
00:01:16,691 --> 00:01:18,790
took them about five years to develop.

20
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,950
You can mix the protein in as little as
four ounces without any clumps or issues

21
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:27,760
of mixed ability whatsoever.
And they nailed the taste.
They tested, for instance,

22
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:32,170
the chocolate version
282 different versions.

23
00:01:32,171 --> 00:01:37,171
It put a lot of money and a lot of
time into r and D for this particular

24
00:01:37,241 --> 00:01:39,790
product, and they have both
way and my seller casing.

25
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:44,791
So if you want to say improve body
composition and recovery overnight slow

26
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:49,000
release, you can take the my seller
casein or in my case, whey protein.

27
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:52,870
I would take postworkout for instance,
or in the morning. So check it out.

28
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,280
These guys were really fascinating.

29
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:58,990

36
00:02:19,961 --> 00:02:23,860
chicken up a scent,

It's my goto platform for
blogging and creating websites.

40
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:41,450
I use wordpress.com for
everything every day. My site,

41
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:46,340
tim.blog is built on it. The websites
for my books, including tools of titans,

42
00:02:46,341 --> 00:02:51,260
tribe of mentors. It's all
in wordpress.com and the
founder Matt Mullenweg,

43
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,440
one of my close friends has
appeared on the show many times.

44
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:58,670
Just search Matt Mullenweg,
Tequila Ferris for quite an exciting time.

Beyonce, five 38 tech crunch, Ted, CNN,

49
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:19,710
and time just to name a handful and one
of my friends at Google who shall remain

50
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,303
nameless,

51
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:26,520
has told me that wordpress.com offers the
best out of the box SEO imaginable and

52
00:03:27,551 --> 00:03:28,120
quote,

53
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:32,650
and it's one of the many reasons that
nearly 30% of the Internet is run on

54
00:03:32,651 --> 00:03:33,484
wordpress.

55
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:37,330

someone that's perhaps the best part.

00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:40,000
wordpress.com guide you
through the entire experience.

need to worry about security upgrades,

59
00:03:48,131 --> 00:03:52,510
hosting any of that there for 24
seven support, and they're very,

60
00:03:52,511 --> 00:03:54,940
very responsive. If you have
questions, they get right back to you,
