1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,880
Optimal, minimal. At this altitude,

2
00:00:02,881 --> 00:00:06,060
I can run flat out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:07,990
I don't know how else you
would pose a question.

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm a cybernetic organism,
living tissue over metal.

5
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:27,370
This episode is brought to you
by fresh books, man. Oh Man.

6
00:00:27,371 --> 00:00:31,840
Do a lot of listeners of this podcast
and readers in mind love fresh books to

7
00:00:31,841 --> 00:00:35,500
the extent that I ended up meeting
with the CEO not very long ago.

8
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,600
Why are they so popular?
Well,

9
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:41,830
they are the number one cloud accounting
software designed exclusively for self

10
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:43,210
employed professionals.

11
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,000
That's many of you and used by
more than 10 million people.

12
00:00:46,001 --> 00:00:49,960
You can send invoices, track your
time, and get paid very, very quickly,

13
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:54,580
which suits the needs of a
lot of freelancers, a lot
of entrepreneurs and beyond.

14
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:56,830
You can't take pictures of receipts.

15
00:00:56,831 --> 00:00:58,310
You can link your credit
card and debit card.

16
00:00:58,311 --> 00:01:03,130
So all of the things you buy automatically
appear in your fresh books in the

17
00:01:03,131 --> 00:01:06,880
right category, so on and so forth.
Makes taxes easy, makes invoices easy.

18
00:01:06,881 --> 00:01:11,840
It makes your life easier. And also
in fact, I would recommend a pdf. Uh,

19
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,510
they didn't ask me to
read this part by the way.

20
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:18,340
They'd put the other pdf a while back
called breaking the time barrier subtitle,

21
00:01:18,341 --> 00:01:21,370
how to unlock your true earning potential
so you can search for breaking the

22
00:01:21,371 --> 00:01:23,620
time barrier.
A lot of people ask me,

23
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:27,130
how can I get a four hour work
week with a service business?

24
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:31,840
And the story in that Ebook, it's pdf is
the short answer is really, really good.

25
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,630
So I think you should also check that out.
So breaking the time error,

26
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:38,230
check it out,
but also why not test out freshbooks.

That sounds like we're going to get very

This episode is brought to you by
[inaudible] dot com the world's largest on

33
00:02:10,911 --> 00:02:12,560
demand massage service.

34
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:17,900
I have been broken so many times over
the years that I usually have body work

35
00:02:17,901 --> 00:02:21,800
done at least once a week. I have a very,
very high bar for this type of thing.

36
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:26,060
And I was very skeptical of sue
with until I tested them. Not once,

37
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:31,330
but I would say at least a dozen times
around the country in different cities.

38
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:36,410
I do not accept anything less than
excellent for any type of soft tissue

39
00:02:36,411 --> 00:02:38,020
treatment.
And uh,

40
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:41,570
would not suggest that you accept
anything less than excellence.

41
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:46,310
So I can affirm personally
that sooth delivers a licensed,

42
00:02:46,311 --> 00:02:51,290
experienced and above all effective in
my book massage therapist and the comfort

43
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:55,220
of your own home hotel or
office in as little as an hour.

44
00:02:55,221 --> 00:02:59,500
So you can think of it as Uber for
massages available and 55 cities at this

45
00:02:59,501 --> 00:03:02,680
point across the US, UK,
Canada, and Australia.

46
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,010
So you can relax just about any time,
any where.

47
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,120
And I've tried many different types of
massage that they offer in the process is

48
00:03:10,121 --> 00:03:14,020
super, super simple. Download
the sue, the APP, that's s o t,

49
00:03:14,021 --> 00:03:17,560
h e or go to [inaudible] dot com
choose the kind of massage you want.

50
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,520
You can select Swedish sports, deep
tissue, or even couples massage.

51
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:26,110
I usually do deep tissue myself or I'll
do couple's massage and then tell both

52
00:03:26,111 --> 00:03:30,430
of the therapists that I'm actually
intending to get a four handed massage

53
00:03:30,431 --> 00:03:33,730
instead of it having two people get
to him massages, if that makes sense.

54
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:37,900
Then you set the length of your massage,
whether 60 9,120 minutes.

55
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:39,460
If you're looking to get fixed,

56
00:03:39,461 --> 00:03:44,461
I usually do 90 or ideally 120 you select
the gender of your therapist and then

57
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:48,550
boom, you're done and you will
see who picks up the call.

58
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:53,910
The service is available from 8:00 AM
to midnight and sooth brings everything

59
00:03:53,951 --> 00:03:57,970
that you need to create a spa experience
in your home and the therapist handles

60
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:01,750
all of this. The massage table, linens,

This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another
episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

67
00:04:31,261 --> 00:04:36,030
it is my job to deconstruct world class
performers of all different types from

68
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:39,810
philosophy, chess, business,
entertainment, you name it,

69
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,650
academia research to tease out the
habits, routines, favorite books,

70
00:04:43,651 --> 00:04:47,730
favorite cereals, morning
routines, whatever it might
be that I think is tactical,

71
00:04:47,731 --> 00:04:50,460
practical that you can
apply to your own life.

72
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:55,200

one of the fastest growing social
networking apps in the world.

She launched bumble into those and 14

please enjoy this conversation
with Whitney Wolfe heard

87
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,310
Whitney, welcome to the show.
Thanks for having me. A local,

88
00:05:58,690 --> 00:05:59,523
a local

89
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:01,270
Austin, Texas. Yeah,

90
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,600
so I wanted to start at the beginning and
for those people who are familiar with

91
00:06:08,321 --> 00:06:12,040
the, a bit of the genesis
story and also the name itself.

92
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:15,610
So how did bumble come to be?
Why did it come to me?

93
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:20,740
So bumble is somewhat of a unique story
in the sense that it wasn't just a

94
00:06:21,171 --> 00:06:23,090
singular Aha moment somewhere.

95
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:26,390
It was really a response to a
couple of different things in life.

96
00:06:26,391 --> 00:06:29,870
And then there was a little
bit of serendipity involved.

97
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:35,230
I had just started becoming the kind
of the center of this attacking,

98
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:39,261
you know,

99
00:06:39,261 --> 00:06:44,261
violent internet abuse and all sorts of
strangers and random people online were

100
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:50,030
just ripping me apart all day long in the
media and in the comments sections and

101
00:06:50,031 --> 00:06:54,440
on Twitter. And it sounds silly to
think that that could affect you.

102
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:55,663
Um,

103
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:01,400
but it devastated me and it made me just,

104
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,520
it just made me so depressed and I started
to realize that there was something

105
00:07:07,611 --> 00:07:08,444
wrong with the Internet.

106
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:13,430
I started to realize that the lack of
accountability on these social networks,

107
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:17,610
that was a real thing and there was a
real risk to that. And I was, I was on,

108
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:21,260
you know, I was a perfect example
of how dangerous it could be.

109
00:07:21,261 --> 00:07:25,610
And if I at 24 who had already
had somewhat, you know,

110
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:30,890
successful career and had great friends
and family around me and I still could

111
00:07:30,891 --> 00:07:35,020
barely get out of bed and I could barely
see straight, I mean, it, it just,

112
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:39,560
it depleted every,
every ounce of confidence that I've ever,

113
00:07:39,561 --> 00:07:40,394
ever had.

114
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:45,260
It scared me for what it would mean for
a 13 year old or 14 year old or 15 year

115
00:07:45,261 --> 00:07:48,380
old who was in junior high
going through this. Right.

116
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:53,090
And so I started to really understand
the danger of the internet and it was

117
00:07:53,091 --> 00:07:56,960
around that time that I started thinking,
what am I going to do next?

118
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,850
Because obviously I'm not going to,
you know,

119
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:03,880
just do nothing at 25 after being part
of this really high growth startup and

120
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,420
having this,
you know,

121
00:08:05,421 --> 00:08:09,830
awesome exposure to so many different
areas of the tech industry. Um,

122
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:14,150
and so I was going to start a female only
social network where you could only be

123
00:08:14,151 --> 00:08:17,720
kind to one another, so you could
only share complimentary behavior.

124
00:08:17,721 --> 00:08:20,810
And the thought process behind it
was compliments are contagious,

125
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:25,440
just like hatred is contagious. Is
it going to be called mercy? Yeah.

126
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,630
Thank you. Right. So it was, it was
supposed to be a kind of social network,

127
00:08:29,631 --> 00:08:32,050
which had never been done.
And um,

128
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:36,920
it was around that time that things kind
of parlayed into where we are now. Um,

129
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:41,540
my now business partner on bumble,
who's been a huge force and you know,

130
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:46,390
bumble coming to life and, and
the, the course of bumble, he, uh,

131
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,250
tried to hire me as his
CMO at his dating company.

132
00:08:49,251 --> 00:08:54,230
He has this huge dating company that's
the match of Europe and South America.

133
00:08:54,231 --> 00:08:58,380
His name is Andre have and ever,
right.

134
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:02,820
So James Bond, um, yeah,
he's, he's pretty awesome.

135
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,930
But he,

136
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,400
he wanted me to go run marketing and is
dating company and I thought he had lost

137
00:09:08,401 --> 00:09:11,820
his mind. Um, and so I told
him what I was going to do.

138
00:09:11,821 --> 00:09:15,690
I'm going to start this new way,
this new age of social media.

139
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:20,400
And he was like, no, you're not. You're
going to do that in dating with me.

140
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:24,180
And I was like, you've lost your mind. Um,

141
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:28,920
but we actually ended up talking through
it and the more thought I gave to this

142
00:09:28,921 --> 00:09:33,330
new concept of a dating app that could
be engineered for women by women,

143
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,990
um, the, the need became more apparent.

144
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:42,270
And so that's how I shifted from this
concept of mercy into what is now bumble,

145
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:47,160
which was, you know, very much
similar concept if you think about it,

146
00:09:47,161 --> 00:09:47,670
you know,

147
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:51,570
creating a brand rooted in kindness
or product rooted in good behavior and

148
00:09:51,571 --> 00:09:55,860
really putting women in charge of that,
creating the female internet. And uh,

149
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:58,110
that was really the beginning of bumble.

150
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:03,420
It was the first name of a
bumbler word, Moxie. Moxie.

151
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:07,770
Yes, it was, I really wanted it
to be moxie. Um, so you know,

152
00:10:07,771 --> 00:10:09,850
for anyone that's familiar with that word,

153
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:14,520
it insinuates that someone
has gall or guts and is brave.

154
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:18,750
And because bumble was going to be this
platform turning society on its head

155
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:23,070
where women were going to make the
first move, which according to society,

156
00:10:23,071 --> 00:10:26,490
that's not something women should do.
Definitely not in dating, right? I mean,

157
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:31,100
it's a tale as old as time men
do that men need to go first. Um,

158
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:35,610
or so society said and says, um, and
so mocks who's going to be the name,

159
00:10:35,611 --> 00:10:38,420
but I couldn't trademark it.
Why couldn't you trademark it?

160
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:43,260
There's somebody else had totally
trademark every corner of it.

161
00:10:43,261 --> 00:10:45,210
It's actually a soda somewhere.

162
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:49,800
And then there's some big PR firm or
some consulting agency that's trademarked

163
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:52,950
the heck out of it. And I couldn't do
it. So how did you land on bumble than,

164
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:57,060
I actually hated the name bumble
at first I thought bumble.

165
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,420
How did it occur to you? And I did not
think of the name bumble. Actually.

166
00:11:00,421 --> 00:11:02,370
Someone on our team or early team did.

167
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,840
And she had actually called her husband
a bumbling idiot and she's got this

168
00:11:06,841 --> 00:11:09,480
British accent. She was like,
you know what about bumble?

169
00:11:09,481 --> 00:11:11,730
Because we'd all been
searching the internet.

170
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:15,860
We literally putting random letters
together to come up with words and mean

171
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,890
anything. What were the other
top contenders? Um, oh goodness.

172
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:23,460
Yeah, because women were going to
take the leap and make the first move.

173
00:11:23,461 --> 00:11:27,570
And actually leap year is a very
interesting story. So in leap year,

174
00:11:27,571 --> 00:11:31,260
folklore says that women would
propose to men during leap year.

175
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,720
And so we thought leap and then we,
you know,

176
00:11:33,721 --> 00:11:38,450
we played with Sadie for
like Sadie Hawkins dance. We
played with several names.

177
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,470
Hawkins, you don't know what the city
Hawkins dances or surprise. Okay.

178
00:11:43,471 --> 00:11:44,310
This is awesome.

179
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:50,030
So the Sadie Hawkins Dance started in
the 1930s and it was based off of a

180
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:55,130
cartoon by al Cap where these women during
leap year would make the first move.

181
00:11:55,901 --> 00:11:56,590
Essentially they,

182
00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:01,590
they'd ask them men to marry them and
this got consolidated into a dance that US

183
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:06,850
school system started putting into place
and it became so popular, you know,

184
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:07,900
the Sadie Hawkins dance,

185
00:12:07,901 --> 00:12:11,290
they'd wear the poodle skirts and
the black and white shoes. Okay.

186
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:12,640
You're going to have to look into this,
but

187
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:16,460
no. Is it a dance? It's
not an actual dance style.

188
00:12:16,461 --> 00:12:17,960
Like a mating ritual dance.

189
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,230
No, it's, it's like a school dance.
So you have the prom, right? Right.

190
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:25,250
And then you had the Sadie Hawkins
dance and the Sadie Hawkins dance was

191
00:12:25,251 --> 00:12:30,251
different from the prom because boys ask
girls to the prom girls asked boys to

192
00:12:30,561 --> 00:12:31,730
the Sadie Hawkins dance.

193
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:35,360
They asked the boy to the
dance and something really
interesting took place when

194
00:12:35,361 --> 00:12:38,570
the Sadie Hawkins dance went into effect.
It became so popular,

195
00:12:38,571 --> 00:12:43,571
they made it a national holiday and it
became so popular because parents felt

196
00:12:44,151 --> 00:12:48,920
that it was a safer option because the
way the boys behaved when the girls asked

197
00:12:48,921 --> 00:12:53,210
to the dance was much less aggressive.
Girls were not crying, feeling left out.

198
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:58,390
So it recalibrated these gender norms
around flirting and dating and courting.

199
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:03,560
And so that was a big inspiration
behind bumble. You know,

200
00:13:03,561 --> 00:13:06,320
when we were thinking about
women making the first move,

201
00:13:06,321 --> 00:13:10,850
it was almost the digital
rendition of that. Did you,

202
00:13:10,851 --> 00:13:15,590
you did or did not like bumble them when
it came up? I did not like it at first.

203
00:13:15,591 --> 00:13:19,850
And I'll tell you why bumble sounded
like fumble. You know, you were,

204
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:23,270
you're fumbling through a
dating experience and we
wanted this to be an app that

205
00:13:23,271 --> 00:13:26,390
was empowering for women where
they felt confident and in control.

206
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:31,960
And it was not until all of these really
cute catchphrases start started being,

207
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:37,620
you know, coming, coming up, people on
our team and friends when, you know,

208
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,860
we're asking, what do you think about
this name or this name or this name?

209
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:44,990
And all of a sudden, um,
these catchphrases were
coming up like, you know,

210
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:48,620
be the Queen Bee of bumble,
find your honey on bumble.

211
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:53,870
And it was in that moment that
we said, okay, this is it.

212
00:13:53,871 --> 00:13:56,780
This is brand ability.
This is how you brand something.

213
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:00,360
And that was that. Was it
off to the races? We went,

214
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:01,810
yeah. If it sticks, it sticks.

215
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:07,380
One of the first things I ask proofreaders
who are typically friends of mine who

216
00:14:07,631 --> 00:14:10,870
are writers or lawyers because they're
really good at spotting sloppy language

217
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:13,510
or words that don't need to be. There are
things that are confusing. In any case,

218
00:14:13,511 --> 00:14:18,511
one of the first questions I ask after
they've read a chapter is I will give it

219
00:14:19,661 --> 00:14:22,570
some time. So like a half hour have
a cup of coffee. I'll say, okay,

220
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:24,610
what do you remember?
And I'll see what,

221
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:26,830
I'll see what the first few
things are that come to mind.

222
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:27,910
It's really interesting.

223
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:33,340
A lot about top of mind like yeah,
I don't think about it too hard.

224
00:14:33,341 --> 00:14:36,340
Like top top line. If it takes
too long, it's like, all right,

225
00:14:36,341 --> 00:14:40,890
I need to rework the entire chapter.
Now,

226
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,920
how many people roughly at
this point use use bumble?

227
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,830
And I know there are many different,
many,

228
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,170
many different metrics and
was he give about it? But we,

229
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:52,490
we look at kind of overall user
base in terms of registrations.

230
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,250
How many times has somebody
download our platform?

231
00:14:55,251 --> 00:14:57,230
How many people have
registered for our APP?

232
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:01,580
We've had over 29 million registrations
now in just over three years.

233
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,970
It's a lot of people. That's
good. It's a few people. Yeah.

234
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:10,230
I saw the part of the beauty of the,
of the approach,

235
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:15,130
and I know that there's a lot of
complexity hidden behind a very simple

236
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,800
interface. Believe me, with the amount
of time that I've spent with startups,

237
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:22,230
I started using bumble very early on.
I mean sort of,

238
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,840
I'm not going to call it Alpha or Beta,
but very early on,

239
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:30,900
and what I realized very quickly is
that by having the woman make the first

240
00:15:31,871 --> 00:15:35,500
move, you also remove one of the biggest
pain points. And you know this for men,

241
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,920
which is women receiving
500,000 unwanted messages.

242
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,930
And even if prince charming
is hiding in there,

243
00:15:43,931 --> 00:15:47,620
even if you are the ones she would
pick, it's too much noise. This,

244
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:52,860
the signal to noise ratio
is so unfavorable that as
a guy you could put out a

245
00:15:53,381 --> 00:15:56,870
hundred messages and get
zero responses and it,

246
00:15:56,871 --> 00:16:00,730
it just cuts out that first
leg of wasted work completely.

247
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:02,110
So thank you for that.

248
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:06,780
Well that's awesome feedback.
It's interesting that you highlight that.

249
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,170
That just plays into these
gender dynamics. You know,

250
00:16:10,171 --> 00:16:15,171
women from the time they start thinking
about who they like or having crushes,

251
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:19,710
it's that it's going to be inbound,
right?

252
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:22,110
They were trained to think
that's going to come to us, that,

253
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,600
that the boys were supposed
to chase the girls and,

254
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,120
and then that turns into the
men chasing the women and,

255
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:32,130
and that we're supposed to essentially
play hard to get and not give in. Right.

256
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,800
And so when the good guy does show up,

257
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:39,990
you oftentimes miss that given those,
you know, those broken dynamics.

258
00:16:39,991 --> 00:16:43,590
And so yeah, when you do flip
the switch it, it does allow,

259
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:46,800
it does allow for better and
more genuine connections.

260
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:53,300
So people might be listening or watching
and they've read a bit about your story

261
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:58,860
and you're on top of the world. Right in
so many ways. Stepping up to the plate,

262
00:16:58,861 --> 00:17:03,861
hitting home runs every time out that
but you mentioned when we got started

263
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:07,350
this, this depressive
period, this dark period.

264
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:11,220
So I wanted to read something that I
found in the course of doing some research

265
00:17:11,221 --> 00:17:14,910
and it may be a paraphrase
but I think it's,

266
00:17:14,911 --> 00:17:19,230
it's somewhat accurate based on checking
with you beforehand but I don't know

267
00:17:19,231 --> 00:17:24,030
the elaboration.
So the quote here,

268
00:17:24,031 --> 00:17:28,350
it's from refinery 29 and it talks about
how you wanted to build a company that

269
00:17:28,351 --> 00:17:29,250
encourages empowerment,

270
00:17:29,251 --> 00:17:31,830
confidence and respect because when you
have self respect it's really hard to

271
00:17:31,831 --> 00:17:34,680
get you down. This is the part I
wanted to dig into for a second.

272
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:38,910
I've been in a place in my life where
I've had no confidence, no self respect,

273
00:17:38,911 --> 00:17:41,340
zero self worth and it was
really easy to hurt my feelings.

274
00:17:41,341 --> 00:17:42,900
Anything would trigger me to be sad.

275
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,380
Then when you rebuild some
of that you become stronger.

276
00:17:46,381 --> 00:17:49,830
So I was hoping you could describe us,

277
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,080
whether it's that episode,

278
00:17:52,081 --> 00:17:56,100
that period that you talked
about or another and I just
one of the darker harder

279
00:17:56,101 --> 00:17:57,210
times.
Sure.

280
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:02,240
And like what a day looked like during
that time and then the things you did or

281
00:18:02,401 --> 00:18:06,270
the things that helped you get
out of that depressive state.

282
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:09,090
And it doesn't have to be depressive,
could be anxiety, could be anything else.

283
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,150
Um, well, you know,

284
00:18:10,151 --> 00:18:13,750
and I still have days like that and I
think that's healthy for listeners or

285
00:18:13,751 --> 00:18:18,751
watchers to understand that just because
something's going well or what pro,

286
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,850
you know,
what people perceive to be going well,

287
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:25,990
it doesn't mean every day is perfect and
I think the hard times in my life have

288
00:18:25,991 --> 00:18:27,820
really shaped the good times in my life.

289
00:18:27,821 --> 00:18:31,450
And I think many people can
agree with that. So, you know,

290
00:18:31,451 --> 00:18:36,451
the inspiration behind bumble
was really driven from self,

291
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,200
you know, self experience and what I've
gone through in my life. Basically.

292
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:45,040
There's been a common theme with every
tough time I've ever gone through.

293
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,800
And that always comes
down to mental abuse.

294
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:52,870
And that has been not just in romantic
endeavors, that could be friendships,

295
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:57,820
toxic friendships. And so there's this
been this recurring theme. And you know,

296
00:18:57,821 --> 00:19:02,590
when I was under so much scrutiny from
the Internet from strangers and I was

297
00:19:02,591 --> 00:19:06,910
allowing these random strangers to
define me and to dictate my day.

298
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:09,780
Can you think of any particular example?
I've personally,

299
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:13,110
I can certainly think of certain
examples. I'm like, oh my God,

300
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:16,470
that one year when that thing came out
on my birthday and it was a hatchet job

301
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:21,190
piece is, can you think of one where
you're like, Oh God, that day. So

302
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:26,170
it was, it was actually right after my
birthday. Funny you say that. It was,

303
00:19:26,171 --> 00:19:26,590
um,

304
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:31,420
the summer of 2014 and all of these
articles were running and I hadn't,

305
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,930
I wasn't speaking to anyone,
I wasn't commenting on any articles.

306
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:38,200
I knew nothing about the
media at that time. Nothing.

307
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:43,230
And I could not have been more naive
when it came to PR and press at that,

308
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:48,940
at that time. And yeah, there'd
be dragons. Got To be careful.
Yeah. And uh, you know,

309
00:19:48,941 --> 00:19:53,170
this story came out one morning,
one afternoon, my dad sent it to me

310
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:58,690
and it was disgusting.
It was talking about,

311
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:04,030
you know, the, basically the,
the piece painted me as this,

312
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:05,950
um,
you know,

313
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:11,850
like at the gone girl of Tech, you
know, she was a seductress and Dah,

314
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:14,890
Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, and all
of these awful, you know,

315
00:20:14,891 --> 00:20:19,891
insinuations and it was talking about
ridiculous things like really personal

316
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:26,190
details that were completely inaccurate
and it was really gross and ugly.

317
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:31,010
And it just made me feel undressed. I
felt naked. Your Dad's commentary like,

318
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,240
well, and that was what
was so devastating. My Dad
was just like, you know,

319
00:20:34,241 --> 00:20:38,320
having your father send you an article and
be like, is this true? Like, of course,

320
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:42,760
no, but what, you know, how do
you have to justify that at 24,

321
00:20:42,761 --> 00:20:46,330
just turning 25 years old
to your father? What, how,

322
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:51,490
how can journalism be that? No one
asked me for comment on that. You know,

323
00:20:51,491 --> 00:20:56,491
no one asked if those allegations were
true and to be this young woman feeling

324
00:20:56,951 --> 00:21:00,430
like I was part of this
like mean girl club.

325
00:21:00,431 --> 00:21:02,590
And you know that the girl that was,
you know,

326
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:06,430
being pointed at and laughed at
by a group of people. I mean,

327
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:10,530
it was awful with the rest of your
day look like I was devastated. I,

328
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:13,060
I actually became physically ill.

329
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:17,650
He's now my husband and thank God for him.
He,

330
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:21,730
I was having such a mental breakdown.
I was actually having a,

331
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:27,520
what they call it, clinical panic attack.
I was hyperventilating, I was distraught.

332
00:21:27,521 --> 00:21:32,500
I couldn't breathe at my site was not
right and he had to take me to his primary

333
00:21:32,501 --> 00:21:32,831
doctor,

334
00:21:32,831 --> 00:21:37,831
like his family doctor and the doctor
literally had to prescribe me one to two

335
00:21:39,221 --> 00:21:42,670
days worth of some. Well, I don't
know, I don't take any medicine.

336
00:21:42,671 --> 00:21:44,110
I'm scared of even Advil,

337
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:49,140
but I think it was like
volume or something to Jay
to physically call me down.

338
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:54,450
I was having a mental breakdown because
I had no way to defend myself and I just

339
00:21:54,761 --> 00:21:59,290
felt helpless and I felt literally
undressed on a huge stage and it was,

340
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,273
it was awful.

341
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:03,680
Yes. Not a great feeling at all.
And it's even worse. I mean,

342
00:22:03,681 --> 00:22:06,620
it's even worse for women. It's bad
for men, but it gets even worse.

343
00:22:06,621 --> 00:22:09,290
I think for women, it can be
terrible for men, don't get me wrong,

344
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,220
but it was talking about that

345
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:14,130
very misogynistic things that really only
apply to women and that's what made it

346
00:22:14,131 --> 00:22:14,964
worse.
You know,

347
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:20,160
making insinuations about who I was as
a woman and my intentions as a woman,

348
00:22:20,161 --> 00:22:23,580
not, it wasn't even about business,
if that makes sense. You know? It was,

349
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:24,920
it was very,

350
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:25,843
it was a very

351
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:30,110
salacious and exciting
compared to the business stuff.

352
00:22:30,111 --> 00:22:33,980
So apparently so paint the picture,
they want to pick out some clicks.

353
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:35,660
No.

354
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:39,620
One thing I'd love to chat about because
it came up in a number of places when I

355
00:22:39,621 --> 00:22:41,510
was doing homework for this,

356
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:46,490
and this is certainly not
uncommon among founders.

357
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:50,130
I know people think, Oh, when the times
are going well, you're doing well.

358
00:22:50,131 --> 00:22:54,500
When the times are going poorly, you're
doing poorly. But a lot of founders,

359
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,020
even when they're starting
up to doing really well,

360
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:02,120
have a certain baseline of low
grade or high grade anxiety.

361
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,970
So plus,

362
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:08,380
so I've heard Peter that points
tell me this. It's the Internet,

363
00:23:08,381 --> 00:23:09,440
so who knows if it's true or not,

364
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:13,250
but at some point you were waking up
every two hours to check your email or

365
00:23:13,251 --> 00:23:14,920
you'd wake up at four 30 check your email,

366
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:19,100
then go back to sleep and wake up
again at six 30 I did that for years.

367
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:20,023
You did that for years

368
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:23,410
actually,
that has just now started to slow down

369
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,550
and I have you at one time been anxious.

370
00:23:25,551 --> 00:23:28,190
Is that been a sort of an
emotional home of sorts?

371
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:32,330
Anxiety paired with drive
and ambition and passion.

372
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:37,010
I'm so dedicated to what I'm doing.
I can't explain it to you. I mean

373
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:43,070
it's just part of my blood at
this point and it's almost like a,

374
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:46,670
it's built into my system.
Yeah,

375
00:23:46,671 --> 00:23:50,600
the anxiety has been really scary over
the years. And there's days where,

376
00:23:50,601 --> 00:23:55,490
you know, I couldn't feel my fingers for
hours or I didn't think I could breathe.

377
00:23:55,491 --> 00:24:00,491
I mean this started manifesting into
physical ailments and God bless my doctor,

378
00:24:00,681 --> 00:24:03,620
he's really going to have to block
my cell phone number at some point.

379
00:24:03,621 --> 00:24:08,420
But you know, it's scary. If you don't
deal with anxiety will take advantage.

380
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:10,790
It will take control over your life.
How have you dealt with it?

381
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:14,780
What are the habits or
routines or self talk?

382
00:24:14,781 --> 00:24:19,781
Anything has helped you to keep it
from going from a fuel to a handicap?

383
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:25,730
Takes control. It definitely
has become a handicap at points,

384
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:28,730
but I would say 85% of
the time it's a fuel.

385
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:31,970
And actually back to the doctor talk,
um,

386
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:35,930
my doctor said something
really interesting to me and
it's something that stuck

387
00:24:35,931 --> 00:24:38,270
with me. I said to him
one day, I was like,

388
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:41,900
I don't know if I can deal with this
anymore. My anxiety is just so extreme.

389
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:45,440
It's paralyzing me at certain points.
Do I need to get on a medicine?

390
00:24:45,441 --> 00:24:48,800
Do I need to be medicated for this?
And he responded,

391
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:51,650
just keep doing good work.
It will,

392
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:54,230
it will recalibrate the way you feel.

393
00:24:54,231 --> 00:24:57,350
And when I thought through that and it
was like, you know what, when I can just,

394
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:59,270
if I can channel this energy and this,

395
00:24:59,271 --> 00:25:02,300
this anxiety and channel
it into doing good work,

396
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:05,570
meaning work that affects
others in a positive way,

397
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,780
it genuinely works.
It actually,

398
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:11,360
if you shift your focus to
shift it and you have to,

399
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:15,050
you've got to harness it and control it.
And my husband's great about this too,

400
00:25:15,051 --> 00:25:17,770
you know, he's just like,
what are your thoughts?

401
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:19,610
Let's get your thoughts under control,
you know,

402
00:25:19,611 --> 00:25:23,060
and how do we harness this and just,
you know,

403
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:28,120
focus on what's causing this and then
how do we shift it into something that's

404
00:25:28,461 --> 00:25:33,020
positive versus you, you know, doing
the, the self doubt thing on repeat

405
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:39,410
with any type of help like journaling
or is it just a conversation with your

406
00:25:39,411 --> 00:25:43,190
husband and are there any, when you
feel it starting to spiral, I mean,

407
00:25:43,191 --> 00:25:45,890
do you have pattern interrupts
that you can use? You know,

408
00:25:45,891 --> 00:25:49,370
I tried to get outside and take a walk
and then my phone and I've found that

409
00:25:49,371 --> 00:25:50,930
that's really helpful.
And also sleep.

410
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:54,920
Nothing is more nourishing to your mind,

411
00:25:54,921 --> 00:25:56,840
body and soul and a good night's sleep.

412
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:00,440
And I think if you can have
uninterrupted sleep for, even if you're,

413
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:03,380
if you're a person that's like, oh, I
only need five or six hours of sleep.

414
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:07,130
If you can try to have a good
seven, eight, nine hours sleep,

415
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:11,870
it really changes the game.
I've also observed,

416
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:16,250
and I think these are actually very
closely related in some people,

417
00:26:16,251 --> 00:26:18,350
but that at least in the

418
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:24,700
for people with depressive symptoms going
to bed before or by say 11 o'clock mix

419
00:26:24,701 --> 00:26:27,830
it very big difference. Absolutely
sure. The words, you know,

420
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:29,950
sleeping from 2:00 AM if you're,

421
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:34,130
let's say self employed and have this
ability or unemployed from to sleep from

422
00:26:34,131 --> 00:26:39,131
say two to 10 is not the same caliber of
sleep that you're going to get from 11

423
00:26:39,801 --> 00:26:44,490
to eight or 11.
So I'm going to flash

424
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:49,470
back to
books specifically.

425
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:54,390
And so I had read at one point a,
I don't think we're going to spend a ton,

426
00:26:54,391 --> 00:26:57,240
ton, ton of time on this right now, but
you ask about your team's mood every day,

427
00:26:57,241 --> 00:27:00,720
which I thought was very interesting
and having have them rank it. Uh,

428
00:27:00,721 --> 00:27:04,470
but what I caught at the end
of this I was curious about,

429
00:27:04,471 --> 00:27:08,400
so it says a box in the corner
contains copies of originals, subtitle,

430
00:27:08,401 --> 00:27:12,690
how nonconformist moved the world by Adam
Grant and wolf tells everyone to take

431
00:27:12,691 --> 00:27:14,700
one home so they can
have a group discussion.

432
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:19,050
Why did you choose to
do that with this book?

433
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:24,030
And do you do it with other books? Are
there other books that you've also used,

434
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:28,130
uh, for employees in the company or
two years whenever it might be? Yeah.

435
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,780
So Mike,
we were saying earlier,

436
00:27:30,781 --> 00:27:35,120
Internet time is like different time
zone from every other, you know,

437
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,083
measure of time.

438
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,100
When we were doing that we were a team of
something like six or seven. I got you.

439
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,950
Great. We were really a tiny team.
We were still in our apartment,

440
00:27:43,951 --> 00:27:46,350
in our conference room,
was in a bathtub and you know,

441
00:27:46,351 --> 00:27:51,351
we were really just trying to keep the
wheels turning and I felt that a good

442
00:27:53,251 --> 00:27:57,300
mechanism of kind of keeping everyone
as fast and as crazy as it was all going

443
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:02,600
can keep keeping everyone on some
form of a thread of commonality.

444
00:28:03,691 --> 00:28:03,961
You know,

445
00:28:03,961 --> 00:28:07,890
where there'd be something everyone could
talk about together that wasn't bumble,

446
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,270
right?
So how could we,

447
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:14,040
how could we have interesting conversation
together as a small team that wasn't

448
00:28:14,041 --> 00:28:16,770
just like, okay, what are we going to do
with our downloads are about new product?

449
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:17,603
Are we going to do,
did it,

450
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:21,600
how could we focus on kind of
interesting insights from someone else?

451
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:25,860
And so we did kind of a poll early on,
what books should we read it together?

452
00:28:25,861 --> 00:28:27,330
Let's try to do a book club together.

453
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:31,920
And this was one of those
pivotal moments of growth.

454
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:36,030
And so it did not last very long.
The Book Club,

455
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:38,700
the book love did not last,
but the intentions were good,

456
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:42,690
the intentions were good and everyone
really liked the idea of trying to turn

457
00:28:42,691 --> 00:28:42,841
off.

458
00:28:42,841 --> 00:28:47,841
Another purpose of that was I was trying
to encourage the team to turn off a

459
00:28:48,181 --> 00:28:50,970
little bit at night. Sure.
And instead of, you know,

460
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:55,890
getting deep into your emails after
you've come home from dinner, open a book,

461
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:58,200
you know,
Reed did detach,

462
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:02,010
do something that is going to challenge
your mind in a way that you're not being

463
00:29:02,011 --> 00:29:06,990
challenged all day long. And so that was
the premise of it all. And um, you know,

464
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:11,310
as you grow, we're now, we're
approaching 100 employees here soon.

465
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:16,380
It's very hard to do, uh, uh, a check on,
you know, how you're feeling every day.

466
00:29:16,381 --> 00:29:18,960
You can't really go around the room with,
you know,

467
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:23,970
so many people and it's really hard to
get everybody together for book club when

468
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:25,350
things are just going so fast.

469
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,253
Yeah.

470
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:31,440
Are there any books personally that
you've gifted often to other people or

471
00:29:32,051 --> 00:29:33,760
re-read allot yourself?

472
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:37,840
Yes, I have, um, several different books,

473
00:29:37,841 --> 00:29:42,841
but to that we can talk about something
I've always gifted and kind of held

474
00:29:43,331 --> 00:29:47,770
close over the years. Is the book
Shantaram have you read Shantaram okay.

475
00:29:47,771 --> 00:29:49,300
I became obsessed with Shandra.
I'm like,

476
00:29:49,301 --> 00:29:53,050
I tried to join the Shantaram
fan club line, like a book club.

477
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,150
It got weird for a second,
but um,

478
00:29:55,510 --> 00:30:00,510
the point is I loved Shantaram and I
loved that it took you into this different

479
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:04,450
element of human understanding.

480
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:08,350
And I wanted my team to read it because
I think it's actually a great marketing

481
00:30:08,351 --> 00:30:09,184
example,

482
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:14,280
how to build a product based on human
behavior and how to understand people

483
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:18,970
around you and what makes people tick,
not just what's the Roi on some billboard.

484
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,180
Right. Um, and so I don't know
what it is about that book.

485
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,890
I can't summarize it in one sentence,

486
00:30:23,891 --> 00:30:28,360
but it just gives you a peak
into the soul of humanity,

487
00:30:28,361 --> 00:30:31,250
if that makes sense.
And so that's a book that I've,

488
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:36,280
I've gifted frequently and I love
also the author has a really good,

489
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:41,890
effectively good by public world. You're
not going to hear from me for a while.

490
00:30:41,891 --> 00:30:44,590
I'm going to continue to do my work,
but I'm not going to appear anywhere.

491
00:30:44,591 --> 00:30:47,140
I'm not going to do anything.
And you've made this public proclamation,

492
00:30:47,141 --> 00:30:50,710
which I thought was very inspiring. I
fantasize about that all the time. Uh,

493
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,060
but wow,
this book,

494
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:57,090
a very powerful story that
catches people very often,

495
00:30:57,611 --> 00:31:01,120
catches people at the right time.
What's the second book?

496
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:04,810
So back to the right time when it
catches people at the right time.

497
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:07,450
I actually read that book. I,
when I graduated from college,

498
00:31:07,451 --> 00:31:12,451
I went and got a backpack at Rei and
went to Asia for a couple to few months.

499
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:18,670
I have no concept of years or time
anymore. And while I was over there,

500
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,060
I spent time in Singapore and,
and throughout several cities.

501
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:27,060
But I also spent time solo at
orphanages in northern Thailand,

502
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:32,350
in Cambodia. Um, and then did a
lot of travel through that area.

503
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:35,110
And that was the book I read on that trip.

504
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:39,880
And so I think as you are sitting on
this bus that breaks down with a bunch of

505
00:31:39,881 --> 00:31:43,360
local Cambodians eating crickets,
reading Shantaram,

506
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:47,590
you're almost taking yourself
out of everything you've
ever known to be true and

507
00:31:47,591 --> 00:31:52,591
understanding how big and vast and how
great the world is around you and really

508
00:31:53,771 --> 00:31:56,920
how small one is. Right. You know,

509
00:31:57,670 --> 00:32:00,820
it just gives you so much perspective.
So that's one book.

510
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,390
Another book that I've
been gifting and um,

511
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:06,370
he should probably make me an ambassador.
So if he listens to this,

512
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,550
this book called the plant
paradox of you heard of it,

513
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:12,490
this will destroy your life in a good way.

514
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:17,540
But it's basically telling you that
everything you've ever heard about health

515
00:32:17,621 --> 00:32:19,480
and wellness is completely false.

516
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:22,210
So he tells you plants are
bad for you essentially.

517
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,240
And I don't know what
it is about this book,

518
00:32:25,241 --> 00:32:29,620
but it might be a little
bit of Hocus pocus, but I,

519
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:33,280
I'm a full believer and so I think I've
sent that book to like a hundred people

520
00:32:33,281 --> 00:32:37,390
at this point. How has it
changed your behavior or? Well,

521
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,860
the big thing for me as I've been so much,

522
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:42,860
I'm also starting to understand
how health catches up.

523
00:32:42,861 --> 00:32:46,160
So for the first few years of bumble,
I mean, I was drinking every night,

524
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,770
not at a club. I mean,
I have not gone out,

525
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:53,210
I've not been social like a normal 20
something year old since I started bumble.

526
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,580
Right? Actually, I became almost a hermit.

527
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:59,600
I became very reclusive and I just
wanted to be with my boyfriend who became

528
00:32:59,601 --> 00:33:00,710
fiance now husband.

529
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:04,370
And I just wanted to be with people that
I really knew and trusted and I didn't

530
00:33:04,371 --> 00:33:08,780
want to go anywhere because I was so
paranoid that everyone hated me or assumed

531
00:33:08,781 --> 00:33:13,040
that these awful things about me
that I genuinely just went to work,

532
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:17,720
went home, maybe cooked dinner, maybe
cried a little bit, maybe drink some wine.

533
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,150
And that was it. And so, um,

534
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:25,240
this health thing has become
a bit more important now.

535
00:33:25,641 --> 00:33:26,474
You know,

536
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:30,260
here you go to work and you can create
as much success as you are able to,

537
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,300
but you have nothing without your health.

538
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:33,680
You have nothing without
your mental health,

539
00:33:33,681 --> 00:33:35,150
you have nothing without
your physical health.

540
00:33:35,151 --> 00:33:39,830
And so that's why I'm kind of getting
into these, these, these books.

541
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:43,520
Um, because I think it's important
to have that type of balance.

542
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:46,970
Has it changed your diet or anything
like that? It actually has. It's,

543
00:33:46,971 --> 00:33:49,700
it's scares you about, you know,
what you're putting in your body. So

544
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,210
it makes you think,
what is your diff?

545
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:54,480
What might a default breakfast or
lunch or dinner look like for you now?

546
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:57,730
Oh Gosh, yes. That's a crazy question. Um,

547
00:33:57,790 --> 00:34:00,370
there is no default is
whatever I can find generally,

548
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,350
but now I'm going to be more thoughtful.

549
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:05,620
So the roles according to
this guy are that, you know,

550
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:08,260
everything you put in your body
as essentially your health, right?

551
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:13,090
And you are what you eat. And so even
getting a piece of organic chicken,

552
00:34:13,091 --> 00:34:15,220
what you used to maybe think
was good for you. Well,

553
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:16,850
what does that chicken
eating, right? Yeah.

554
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:21,400
So it's just this awful rabbit
hole that you go down. But it's,

555
00:34:21,401 --> 00:34:23,680
it's interesting and it's
important to understand.

556
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:26,350
We know the effects on
the planet and you know,

557
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,940
that's a conversation for another time.

558
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:30,620
All right, cool. I'll
check it out. Yeah. The uh,

559
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:35,570
everything you put in your mouth on your
body is a drug and it has a biochemical

560
00:34:35,571 --> 00:34:35,871
effect.

561
00:34:35,871 --> 00:34:38,570
So you have to think of it that way when
you sent the plant paradox and plants

562
00:34:38,571 --> 00:34:39,750
are bad for you.
Uh,

563
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:44,260
there are a lot of plants that really
don't want you to eat them. Exactly.

564
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:47,690
That's what this is all about.
There are a lot of them. And uh,

565
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:49,070
made me think briefly,

566
00:34:49,071 --> 00:34:53,870
I'm not going to get into a bit of Zuko
who is the Creator Slash Cook Creator?

567
00:34:53,871 --> 00:34:56,570
I'm not sure which ofZ cash.
Cryptocurrency,

568
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:00,210
really smart guy who eats only meat,

569
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:03,410
does not eat any vegetables whatsoever.
And he's been doing that for years.

570
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:03,761
See,

571
00:35:03,761 --> 00:35:07,980
because a lot of the plants have defense
mechanisms and they will poison you.

572
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:12,790
Yup. Yeah. They're, they're
learning to plants. I mean, Nice.

573
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:16,760
Since they are fixed in their mobility,
they can't run away from predators.

574
00:35:16,761 --> 00:35:20,100
So they'd develop all sorts of very,
very, very clever defense mechanism.

575
00:35:20,101 --> 00:35:23,570
Currently beans are toxic
for you. Yeah. Beans. This,

576
00:35:23,571 --> 00:35:26,870
we don't have time to get into the
bean rabbit hole. The beans. Yes.

577
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:31,190
This is bins. This comes
up a lot. I'm not, well,

578
00:35:31,191 --> 00:35:35,090
I'll digress for a second just because
you have very strict like militant Paleo,

579
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:36,500
which is like if you eat beans,

580
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,910
your GI tract will explode while
you're walking down the street.

581
00:35:38,911 --> 00:35:42,690
Like you have to be, I'm exaggerating
a little bit there. They're like,

582
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:47,440
if you eat beans, it is like
swallowing broken glass. Uh,

583
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:51,360
I tend to, I tend to be more
moderate and my views of beans,

584
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:56,040
I find them somewhat helpful also given
their fiber content and so on for a lot

585
00:35:56,041 --> 00:36:00,960
of things including weight loss. But,
uh, if you look at certainly, uh,

586
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:06,110
many different plants that have something
as seemingly innocuous to say oxalic

587
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:07,680
acid,
which is why you get that,

588
00:36:07,681 --> 00:36:10,770
that certain feeling in your mouth
when you eat a lot of say, raw spinach,

589
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:11,581
which is,

590
00:36:11,581 --> 00:36:15,980
can be somewhat innocuous down to
[inaudible] and other things that can,

591
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:20,790
they can actually do a fair amount of
damage. But we should title this episode,

592
00:36:20,791 --> 00:36:22,800
bumble and bumble and

593
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:30,540
bumble and beans, uh, or bar in Austin

594
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,740
right next to me and
I'd cat. All right. Uh,

595
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:40,140
next question is what
purchase of $100 or less,

596
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:41,520
it doesn't have to be exactly that,

597
00:36:41,521 --> 00:36:46,260
but what purchase that is not something
exceptionally expensive, uh, has,

598
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,170
has positively impacted
your life in recent memory.

599
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:53,600
It could be a few years ago, could be, um,

600
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:58,520
coconut oil, coconut oil, what
do you use it for? Everything.

601
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:03,070
You can take a bath with it. You can
put it in a smoothie, you can cook,

602
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:07,230
you can actually put it on your skin.

603
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:13,020
I think coconut oil miracle by,
yeah.

604
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:18,000
Yeah, I agree. Has some
really fascinating, uh, uh,

605
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:22,020
it's like antifungal antibiotic properties
as well. Anytime I curb, you'll,

606
00:37:22,021 --> 00:37:23,580
I should say,
even if you get a cut,

607
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:27,740
they say you can put coconut
oil on it and it helps. Yeah.

608
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:31,980
Coconut oil is, uh, is really
fascinating on, on many different levels.

609
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:36,300
Useful for a bunch of diets maybe
that are contained and paradox,

610
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:40,280
probably not just because of the
concentration of MCT oil effectively. Uh,

611
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:44,680
but the thing you should always
keep one in your bathtub,

612
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:48,360
your bathtub, you can put a big
scoop of coconut oil in a hot bath,

613
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:53,610
nourishes your skin and it's actually
calming and relaxing and then you keep one

614
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:56,340
in the kitchen. Do everything
with it. Yeah, coconut oil,

615
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:00,660
almost used to cook it the other day,
but the burning point is, is not high,

616
00:38:00,661 --> 00:38:01,800
not low.
It's around the same,

617
00:38:01,801 --> 00:38:05,550
I believe are in the same as all the on
of like a smoking points around three 50

618
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:10,660
Fahrenheit.
Apparently oil's bad for you.

619
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:14,470
I don't want to go for cooking
groups is. Yep. Alright.

620
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:17,430
So olive oil varies greatly.
Uh,

621
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,640
your mileage may vary with
your olive oil purchase system.

622
00:38:20,641 --> 00:38:25,641
Ferris brought to you by
the bunch you by bumble.

623
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:30,180
Uh, good, good answer. Uh, yeah.

624
00:38:30,181 --> 00:38:33,840
Coconut oil also keeps forever. This
is a very useful to have around. Uh,

625
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:36,243
also

626
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:40,330
little, um, Smithson, um, journals,

627
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:44,260
the little, the little mini ones,
they come in yellow with a B.

628
00:38:44,261 --> 00:38:49,090
I like to gift those to people on my
team and just their low price point.

629
00:38:49,091 --> 00:38:51,460
I think they're like $60 for
actually a pretty big one.

630
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:54,070
And you can actually have it monogrammed.
Yeah.

631
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:57,670
And it's just a nice little
leather, um, notebook.

632
00:38:57,671 --> 00:39:01,480
And I just think taking
notes actually is really,

633
00:39:01,481 --> 00:39:05,860
really therapeutic and it's also
incredibly productive. I mean,

634
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:09,310
you'd be so shocked and I
know that you know this,

635
00:39:09,311 --> 00:39:14,311
but I was so shocked when I started just
writing things down as they came up and

636
00:39:15,791 --> 00:39:18,700
the stuff I was going back
to that I written down,

637
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:22,090
I would have never in a thousand years
remembered had I not written it down.

638
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:27,330
It's fascinating to see how much the
human mind actually just disposes of Oh,

639
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:31,360
in terms of memory.
And so I think that's a great little gift.

640
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:34,420
Yeah, it, it's really
powerful. And I mean,

641
00:39:34,421 --> 00:39:37,870
you're kind of preaching to the
converted since I've saw many notebooks,

642
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:40,600
but I think as a guy,

643
00:39:40,601 --> 00:39:45,280
especially there's this mental hurdle
with thinking of a journal is a diary that

644
00:39:45,281 --> 00:39:47,840
I just can't sleep over, so I can't, but,

645
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:52,360
but if I feel like this is my activity,
yellow pages,

646
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:57,390
then it serves the same function really.
You have that chronicle and uh,

647
00:39:57,490 --> 00:40:01,930
it's, it's true that we really think
we are going to remember forever.

648
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:06,310
The things that we will very soon forget
that was made so clear to me actually

649
00:40:06,311 --> 00:40:11,311
when I was 15 my first time abroad with
any real time was as an exchange student

650
00:40:13,601 --> 00:40:18,190
in Japan for a year. Totally changed my
life. Lived with Japanese in Tokyo. Wow.

651
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:22,330
Was the only, oh, so ended up the
only American in a Japanese school,

652
00:40:22,331 --> 00:40:26,500
5,000 Japanese kids. So if you want to
talk about where's Waldo school uniform,

653
00:40:26,501 --> 00:40:29,200
the whole nine yards. Yeah. It must have
been incredible. Every class in Japanese.

654
00:40:29,201 --> 00:40:30,034
Yeah.
It was wild.

655
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:35,070
And I had these phone calls with my
mom catching up with my parents and she

656
00:40:35,711 --> 00:40:40,711
would take copious notes every time after
we had spoken so that she could give

657
00:40:41,261 --> 00:40:42,130
it to me later.

658
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:46,900
And I look back at those notes
and I don't remember 98% of it.

659
00:40:46,901 --> 00:40:50,200
I mean now, now I do as a queue.
But if she hadn't done that,

660
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,950
all of those incredible experiences
just would have been gone. Wow.

661
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:57,010
That's fantastic. Uh,
it's really interesting.

662
00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:02,230
When is the last time you cried?
Tears of joy yesterday. Yesterday.

663
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:05,230
Got some big news,
can't tell you about it unfortunately,

664
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:11,760
but I got some big news and I got
the news in my office with two of my,

665
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:16,150
you know,
kind of closest allies and very,

666
00:41:16,151 --> 00:41:21,151
very early employees and key members of
the team and we all kind of freaked out

667
00:41:22,511 --> 00:41:26,170
and we were screaming in my office and
HR came over and was like, what's wrong?

668
00:41:26,171 --> 00:41:29,200
Everyone's worried or something, what's
going on in there? And I'm like, no,

669
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:32,320
everything's great. Can't tell you
what it is you'll see in a month.

670
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:35,660
But I'm actually cried tears of joy.
It's just,

671
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:41,020
it's awesome when when certain things
come up that you felt were so far away in

672
00:41:42,171 --> 00:41:47,120
terms of them being obtainable
were actually happening,
but you've worked really,

673
00:41:47,121 --> 00:41:50,510
really, really, really,
really hard to get there. Um,

674
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:55,280
when those two pieces
collide into actual reality,

675
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:57,380
it's just like such an emotional thing.

676
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:00,500
I also cried tears of
joy about a week ago.

677
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,040
So my husband broke his back in
an awful car accident a year ago,

678
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:07,580
exactly a year ago. And he had, you know,

679
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:09,500
they thought he was going
to be a quadriplegic.

680
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:11,630
They thought he was maybe going
to die in surgery, who knew,

681
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:14,810
who knew what was going to happen and he
was in critical condition for almost a

682
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:18,290
week and that hospital,
I mean I just didn't leave it.

683
00:42:18,291 --> 00:42:22,280
I stayed in that Icu with him the
whole time and this year, a year later,

684
00:42:22,281 --> 00:42:24,620
he was fortunate enough
obviously he's walking,

685
00:42:24,621 --> 00:42:28,340
thank God and he's healthy and he's
well and we went back to the hospital

686
00:42:28,341 --> 00:42:33,341
exactly a year later and
he very generously with his
family had donated the new

687
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:39,550
intensive care center at the
exact hospital and all of
his nurses that took care

688
00:42:40,251 --> 00:42:42,830
of him for that week who were,
you know,

689
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:47,240
literally holding me as I sobbed and
was terrified that they came to the

690
00:42:47,241 --> 00:42:47,811
ceremony.

691
00:42:47,811 --> 00:42:52,460
And that was just the craziest feeling
to go from being in the darkest,

692
00:42:52,461 --> 00:42:52,851
darkest,

693
00:42:52,851 --> 00:42:57,470
darkest possible situation in a certain
building to coming back and being in the

694
00:42:57,471 --> 00:43:01,080
best possible situation. That's just
like a really emotional situation.

695
00:43:01,081 --> 00:43:02,870
So I definitely cried tears of joy that

696
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,980
that day. Where were you born and
raised in Salt Lake City, Utah.

697
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:06,940
That's what I thought.

698
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:10,450
So when you're going through this
experience with your husband,

699
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,313
you're at the hospital,

700
00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:14,560
whether you're on the way there at
the hospital during that period,

701
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:20,760
were there any mantras or quotes or
prayers or anything that you relied on to

702
00:43:22,001 --> 00:43:25,630
help or reminded yourself on? If it
doesn't have to be during that period,

703
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:29,890
but I mean work questions you asked
yourself. I'm just wondering if there's,

704
00:43:29,891 --> 00:43:34,110
if there's anything that you go to
in moments like that, that you find,

705
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:39,110
you know, I do try to tap into
whatever the higher power is, right?

706
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:41,050
I'm not a religious person.
Um,

707
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:45,560
I do feel that I'm somewhat spiritual
and spirituality comes out in moments of

708
00:43:45,561 --> 00:43:48,350
darkness, you know, or in moments
of fear. And it's interesting,

709
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:52,960
you almost feel this sense of security
when you feel the least secure of

710
00:43:52,961 --> 00:43:56,090
possible. I don't know how to
explain that, but it's really spooky.

711
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:59,810
So actually the night before his accident,
I actually had a dream,

712
00:43:59,811 --> 00:44:01,250
something awful was
going to happen to him.

713
00:44:01,251 --> 00:44:05,030
And I called him that morning and I said,
I feel sick.

714
00:44:05,031 --> 00:44:07,850
I was like six in the morning. I woke
him up early and I said, I feel sick.

715
00:44:07,851 --> 00:44:09,440
I had this awful dream.
I need to come home.

716
00:44:09,441 --> 00:44:13,430
Cause he was actually not in Austin at
the time and he was in Tyler where his

717
00:44:13,431 --> 00:44:17,600
businesses and so home is kind of, we've
kind of commute is I need to come home.

718
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:20,600
I can't go to la today. I, I've got to get
home. I just don't feel good about this.

719
00:44:20,601 --> 00:44:23,180
And he was like, chill out. Like
I'm going to go walk the dogs.

720
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:26,690
You go downstairs like how some
coffee call me on your way to work.

721
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:31,470
And I just had this sick feeling and
this really bad feeling like something's

722
00:44:31,471 --> 00:44:32,400
not right.
Something's not right.

723
00:44:32,401 --> 00:44:34,230
And I called him on the way to
work and he didn't answer it.

724
00:44:34,231 --> 00:44:38,910
I just started sobbing in the car and I
had to kind of slap myself and both the

725
00:44:38,911 --> 00:44:40,620
window down and be like,
you're having a panic attack.

726
00:44:40,621 --> 00:44:45,060
Like this is so you had too much coffee.
And I just couldn't calm myself down.

727
00:44:45,061 --> 00:44:47,940
And Lo and behold, five
minutes later, you know,

728
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,970
I got the phone call back from his,
um,

729
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,370
chief operations officer who
was following an ambulance.

730
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:56,970
And so that really stuck with
me through the whole week.

731
00:44:56,971 --> 00:44:59,850
And I was trying to wrap my head
around that. I was trying to, you know,

732
00:44:59,851 --> 00:45:02,610
decipher why did I, why am I
feeling those things? So my,

733
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:06,790
my message in that not to ramble
is that I genuinely believe ev,

734
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:11,830
every person on this planet has a sense
of intuition and it's learning how to

735
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:17,360
separate that from fear or anxiety or
panic and really listen to your gut.

736
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:20,700
And, um, I really think that, that,

737
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:24,480
that's what has gotten me to where
I am today is that, you know,

738
00:45:24,481 --> 00:45:27,630
listening to your gut when
you can. And um, so yeah,

739
00:45:27,631 --> 00:45:31,680
that was my only really mantra was just
to kind of listen to what was going on

740
00:45:31,681 --> 00:45:33,930
and try to keep it under control.

741
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:40,170
So I won't go too far into this because
the people who don't already think I'm

742
00:45:40,171 --> 00:45:43,730
crazy, we'll definitely think I'm
crazy, but I probably think I'm psycho.

743
00:45:43,731 --> 00:45:48,600
I've been systematically reducing my
caffeine consumption so that there's less

744
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:53,660
noise in order that I can
better listen to those feelings.

745
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:59,990
Because I have found when I kind of
raised the level of volume and static with

746
00:46:01,591 --> 00:46:04,530
adrenaline and other stress hormones,

747
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:10,070
it drowns out some of the
signal and my dog is all sudden.

748
00:46:10,441 --> 00:46:13,620
This is not that uncommon.
I mean babies and dogs I think also,

749
00:46:13,621 --> 00:46:18,300
but my dog is very much every time she,
she never barks,

750
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:20,110
she really rarely barks at anyone.

751
00:46:20,111 --> 00:46:25,111
And if she barks are growls at any
journalist and member of the media,

752
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:29,040
what I've ignored it,
it is,

753
00:46:29,070 --> 00:46:33,750
it has within 24 hours,
uh,

754
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:36,390
ended up that I should
have heated that warning.

755
00:46:36,391 --> 00:46:39,670
So I'd use that as one
of my many checkboxes.

756
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:43,650
Of course I'm using using some
more left brain as well, but I am,

757
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:46,970
I'm valuing more highly the,

758
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:49,350
the less obvious,

759
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:55,240
less perhaps structured thinking because
the vast majority of our evolution is

760
00:46:55,321 --> 00:46:58,450
not prefrontal cortex. Let's sit
down with a spreadsheet. Yep.

761
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:02,290
And so if you have a funny
feeling, yeah, yeah, it's worth it.

762
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:04,060
It's worth exploring that.
So

763
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:08,260
interesting you say that because
every time I'm like, damn,

764
00:47:08,261 --> 00:47:10,270
why did I not do that?
Or why did I do that?

765
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:14,080
If I think back to when I made the
decision against our forest, something,

766
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,910
I always had the right answer,
if that makes sense. Yeah.

767
00:47:17,110 --> 00:47:20,020
But then you go on the other way for
whatever reason and you've kind of like,

768
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:23,740
she had to listen to myself.
Yeah. And for anybody out there,

769
00:47:23,741 --> 00:47:25,030
like even in business,

770
00:47:25,330 --> 00:47:29,620
I think that's such a good way to
have the answers because a lot of

771
00:47:29,621 --> 00:47:31,960
entrepreneurs we don't have the answer is,
you know,

772
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:35,890
even though I've had this amazing business
partner who has a lot of answers and

773
00:47:35,891 --> 00:47:38,050
I've been able to tap into his knowledge,

774
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:41,260
there's still so many days
where I have no idea what to do.

775
00:47:41,590 --> 00:47:44,380
And you're left with one thing
and that's your gut and that's it.

776
00:47:44,410 --> 00:47:46,750
And you have to try to listen.
But I'm with you on the coffee thing,

777
00:47:46,751 --> 00:47:50,710
like I've tried to have only one step
because I will literally start spinning

778
00:47:50,711 --> 00:47:54,250
out of control.
So I'm with you on the toning it down.

779
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:58,340
Yeah. To end a Emmy for it.
For people who are wondering,

780
00:47:58,341 --> 00:48:01,520
well how does that actually apply? How
do you listen to it? And yet in my case,

781
00:48:01,521 --> 00:48:02,720
one of the clearest examples,

782
00:48:02,721 --> 00:48:07,721
if I look back at the 70 to 90 startups
that I've invested in over a 10 year

783
00:48:08,391 --> 00:48:11,660
period from like 2007 to 2017,
uh,

784
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:14,030
and a lot of those were
passive at any given time.

785
00:48:14,031 --> 00:48:17,980
There are no more than like four or five
active needing my help. So it wasn't a,

786
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,920
it was in waves, certainly, but,
and not often make it as you know,

787
00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:24,700
how do you keep track all of that?
That's a whole set.

788
00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:27,650
We could talk about it with the whole
separate conversation. I call no bucks.

789
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:31,190
Well, I'll give you one once. One
thing that I borrowed from Japan,

790
00:48:31,191 --> 00:48:33,110
actually this is getting
a little off topic,

791
00:48:33,111 --> 00:48:36,530
but so there's something called the k
two in Japan where if you look at the

792
00:48:36,531 --> 00:48:37,550
conglomerates,

793
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:42,740
the very often they will buy a company
that can be a supplier or customer for

794
00:48:43,041 --> 00:48:48,041
another company within their portfolio
or that has some type of knowledge.

795
00:48:48,350 --> 00:48:51,220
It can be transferred to other divisions.

796
00:48:51,770 --> 00:48:53,660
Every time I looked at
a portfolio company,

797
00:48:53,661 --> 00:48:58,661
one of the ideal boxes to check was
how much can they be helped by end help

798
00:48:59,150 --> 00:49:01,520
another company in the
portfolio is in the portfolio.

799
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:05,150
Very smart way that decreases the,

800
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:09,110
it increases the efficiency,
uh, for everyone,

801
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:12,920
but also decreases the actual so heavy
lifting that I have to do as a solo

802
00:49:12,921 --> 00:49:16,820
operator. Uh, but when I look
at all of those companies,

803
00:49:17,690 --> 00:49:21,810
and there's the good, the bad and the ugly
within that, as you would imagine, uh,

804
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:27,760
the gut feeling and feeling good about a
company or feeling good about a founder

805
00:49:28,191 --> 00:49:29,840
isn't enough for me to invest,

806
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:34,310
but feeling off about a founder's
enough for me not to invest.

807
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:37,400
And when an agreement,
right. So because every,

808
00:49:37,670 --> 00:49:40,520
a lot of really good founders
are going gonna have a,

809
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:43,790
maybe not a Jobsian level
d reality distortion field,

810
00:49:43,791 --> 00:49:46,130
but they're gonna be very good at
selling and there can be very good at

811
00:49:46,131 --> 00:49:48,710
persuading. And if they're not, well,
guess what? That tells you something too,

812
00:49:48,770 --> 00:49:51,400
because they're, they should be. Yeah. Uh,

813
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:56,500
so it's very easy to drink the Koolaid
even if you think you're immune to their

814
00:49:57,081 --> 00:50:00,230
charismatic effects. So if I feel good
about it, it's like, all right, trust,

815
00:50:00,231 --> 00:50:02,720
but verify. Let me, let me,
let's get some documents. Yeah,

816
00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:07,010
let's look at the documentation. Let's
actually look into that feeling. But yeah,

817
00:50:07,011 --> 00:50:09,290
exactly.
Whenever I've violated that,

818
00:50:09,291 --> 00:50:11,810
which I did in some of the early cases
where it's like, well, we have this,

819
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:15,200
this leap that we have, all these
amazing investors were closing 48 hours,

820
00:50:15,201 --> 00:50:17,570
we're oversubscribed. We can fill
you out. And all that Fomo Shit.

821
00:50:19,430 --> 00:50:23,750
And then I invest on, and I'm
like, I fucking knew it. I
knew, I knew it within the,

822
00:50:23,870 --> 00:50:25,160
not even the first hour,

823
00:50:25,161 --> 00:50:28,790
like I knew within the first five minutes
didn't feel right with that person.

824
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:34,170
Okay. So that's enough. No, that's really
interesting though. Mumbo jumbo, but yeah,

825
00:50:34,171 --> 00:50:38,170
just like good advice to people. Yeah.
Seriously passionate about stuff. Yeah.

826
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:41,300
There's a book for people who are
thinking about how this might apply more

827
00:50:41,301 --> 00:50:44,750
broadly, uh, called the gift
of fear by Gavin de Becker,

828
00:50:44,751 --> 00:50:47,510
which talks about this and how
people get themselves into very,

829
00:50:47,511 --> 00:50:49,760
very awful situations.
Women,

830
00:50:49,761 --> 00:50:54,170
especially often by not paying
attention to that feeling,

831
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:56,600
that nagging feeling.
It's really important to pay attention to

832
00:50:58,190 --> 00:51:02,300
what is one of the best or most
worthwhile investments you've ever made.

833
00:51:02,301 --> 00:51:05,900
And that doesn't have to be money. It
could be money, but it could be time.

834
00:51:05,901 --> 00:51:08,010
It could be energy.
Uh,

835
00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:12,620
anything that you've invested into
that gave you a tremendously high Roi,

836
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:17,660
best thing I've ever invested into his
time and dedication into my team at

837
00:51:17,661 --> 00:51:21,920
bumble. Okay? 100%. The best thing
I've ever invested in. And you know,

838
00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:25,070
it's been such a,
um,

839
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:29,630
dedicated effort over the
last three and a half years,

840
00:51:29,631 --> 00:51:31,730
but really investing that extra,

841
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:36,410
that extra hour or that extra day
or that extra thought or that extra,

842
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:39,090
get to know someone. Right? Um,

843
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:43,490
that's the stuff that counts the
most because when you do that,

844
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:48,200
you instill more than just
a job opportunity. You know,

845
00:51:48,201 --> 00:51:51,170
you give more than just
an opening at a company.

846
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:56,560
You really leave them with the same values
and the mission becomes ingrained in

847
00:51:57,651 --> 00:52:00,080
them and they're able to do their job.

848
00:52:00,081 --> 00:52:03,410
And in a way that is almost,
um,

849
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:09,040
immune to competition because there so
on the same page with why you started the

850
00:52:09,621 --> 00:52:10,730
company to begin with,

851
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:14,630
what are, what are some ways
that you do that concretely? Uh,

852
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:20,240
whether it's in the onboarding
process or ongoing or otherwise,

853
00:52:20,241 --> 00:52:23,270
like anything you do on a monthly or
weekly or quarterly or whatever basis.

854
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:25,370
W can you give an example? Yeah. Yeah.

855
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:30,760
So I think that your first 10 hires
are what defines the future of your

856
00:52:31,221 --> 00:52:35,330
business. Because no singular
human can scale culture.

857
00:52:35,510 --> 00:52:36,560
It's impossible.

858
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:42,250
There's no way to have the time or the
bandwidth or the actual physical ability

859
00:52:42,530 --> 00:52:47,450
to go and instill your vision
and your values in, you know,

860
00:52:47,451 --> 00:52:50,480
hundreds of employees as things
grow if you're so fortunate.

861
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:55,370
So those first 10 people,
they are your culture warriors.

862
00:52:55,730 --> 00:52:59,360
And if you can invest everything
you've got into those people,

863
00:52:59,570 --> 00:53:03,980
those people will then invest everything
they've got into the people that work

864
00:53:03,981 --> 00:53:06,860
under them or you know,
beside them.

865
00:53:06,890 --> 00:53:11,240
And that's how you scale
culture. And I'm so, you know,

866
00:53:11,241 --> 00:53:13,730
in the early days we're talking weekends,

867
00:53:13,731 --> 00:53:17,180
like I would do whatever I could
to make experiences for my,

868
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:21,950
my key early hires so that they
felt they felt like family,

869
00:53:21,951 --> 00:53:25,140
but in a non boundary
crossing way, right. You know,

870
00:53:25,141 --> 00:53:27,870
we still had boundaries where they still
had their own lives and we were trying

871
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:31,620
to keep things healthy. So, you know,

872
00:53:31,621 --> 00:53:34,680
having everyone over to my house on a
Saturday and making sure that they had a

873
00:53:34,681 --> 00:53:35,221
great day,

874
00:53:35,221 --> 00:53:40,050
but really explaining to them my pain
points that I lived through in my life and

875
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:43,380
why this company's going to
make a difference and, you know,

876
00:53:43,381 --> 00:53:46,320
share with them how we can actually
have real impact on the world,

877
00:53:46,321 --> 00:53:50,580
not just a paycheck or the
potential to be a big, you know,

878
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:52,410
valuation one day.
Right.

879
00:53:52,411 --> 00:53:55,770
How do we actually change the world
through what we're doing and changing the

880
00:53:55,771 --> 00:54:00,510
world doesn't necessarily mean,
you know, uh, on the main scale,

881
00:54:00,511 --> 00:54:03,210
you can change the world by
affecting one person, right?

882
00:54:03,211 --> 00:54:04,860
That is putting good energy out there.

883
00:54:04,861 --> 00:54:09,440
And so investing that mantra and
kind of putting that time and,

884
00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:12,630
and really finessing that,

885
00:54:12,990 --> 00:54:17,990
that ethos has served me very well and
I'm so proud of them because they're all

886
00:54:18,211 --> 00:54:19,950
now leaders in their own right.
I'm,

887
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:24,780
I want them to feel like mini CEOs
of their own in their own way.

888
00:54:24,781 --> 00:54:27,510
And you know, I, if I'm not
in the office for two weeks,

889
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:29,700
I don't want it to be like,
oh, the boss is out because no,

890
00:54:29,730 --> 00:54:32,760
there every so many bosses in that
office and they're amazing and they're

891
00:54:32,761 --> 00:54:37,020
passionate and they're inspiring and
they're just as impactful as I am right to

892
00:54:37,021 --> 00:54:38,970
this company.
And that's how I wanted it to be.

893
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:42,670
What are some of the,

894
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:46,510
the rules are better
perhaps as the question is,

895
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:51,640
what advice have you been given by mentors
or others that has really helped you

896
00:54:51,730 --> 00:54:53,530
in the early stages of building a company?

897
00:54:54,430 --> 00:54:56,770
It doesn't have to be specifically
hiring but it, but it could.

898
00:54:56,860 --> 00:55:01,860
And if that's too tough or just
maybe not an interesting question,

899
00:55:02,650 --> 00:55:06,790
just advice that you've received from
mentors are key lessons you've taken away

900
00:55:06,791 --> 00:55:07,900
from any particular mentor?

901
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:09,060
Yeah,
I've,

902
00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:13,350
I've received a lot of interesting advice
and I think that the more you listen

903
00:55:13,351 --> 00:55:16,580
and the more you absorb,
the better you are. Um,

904
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:19,740
as much as I've tried to say,
you know,

905
00:55:19,770 --> 00:55:23,310
I'm going to do this my way and your
advice is nice and your advice was great,

906
00:55:23,311 --> 00:55:26,730
but I'm going to trust my gut and I'm
going to build the company that I want it

907
00:55:26,731 --> 00:55:29,850
to be. I have gotten great, um,

908
00:55:30,150 --> 00:55:33,990
great pieces of advice from
so many people. And I think
that my business partner,

909
00:55:33,991 --> 00:55:38,190
like I said, he had been in the dating
industry for almost a decade before me.

910
00:55:38,191 --> 00:55:41,460
And so there were times I would
call upon him and say, Hey,

911
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,290
I'm thinking about doing
this. And he'd say, well,

912
00:55:43,291 --> 00:55:46,500
I think you should think about it in a
different way because he had been through

913
00:55:46,501 --> 00:55:48,630
it. And so, I know this
is going to sound silly,

914
00:55:48,631 --> 00:55:51,390
but the best piece of advice I've
ever received was from my husband's

915
00:55:51,391 --> 00:55:56,391
grandfather and he said the most expensive
currency in the world is experience.

916
00:55:57,330 --> 00:56:02,310
There's nothing better than experience.
You cannot buy it. You can not pay for it.

917
00:56:02,311 --> 00:56:04,920
You cannot go out and get it overnight.

918
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:09,960
So tapping into people with experience
and actually trusting them when you feel

919
00:56:09,961 --> 00:56:12,390
that they're off base,
but really trusting them.

920
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:16,110
That's been such good advice that served
me so well because you've probably been

921
00:56:16,111 --> 00:56:18,420
here too. You know, here
I am, this like, you know,

922
00:56:18,421 --> 00:56:21,360
20 something year old a couple years ago.
I'm still 20 something year old,

923
00:56:21,361 --> 00:56:24,340
but going out and doing
things my own way and saying,

924
00:56:24,341 --> 00:56:27,340
oh well you just don't understand or I
want to do it my way or no, trust me,

925
00:56:27,341 --> 00:56:28,174
it's going to be like this.

926
00:56:28,810 --> 00:56:32,320
Tapping into someone who's done it before
and even if you disagree with them,

927
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:34,630
really thinking twice
before you shut them down.

928
00:56:34,631 --> 00:56:37,990
And so I just think that served me pretty
well over the years is to not write

929
00:56:37,991 --> 00:56:39,520
off people with experience.

930
00:56:41,490 --> 00:56:42,590
And then for the more,

931
00:56:42,591 --> 00:56:45,170
even if you feel like you're
strong enough to figure it out.

932
00:56:45,171 --> 00:56:48,410
I mean certainly looking at
a lot of founders, I know

933
00:56:50,090 --> 00:56:54,210
it can be very, you can feel
very isolating as a CEO and a,

934
00:56:55,130 --> 00:56:58,890
I remember chatting with Amanda Palmer,
the musician much more than musician, uh,

935
00:56:58,910 --> 00:57:00,440
certainly done a lot.

936
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:05,820
But if people search Amanda Palmer asking
for help or how to ask for help, it's,

937
00:57:05,910 --> 00:57:08,090
it's extremely helpful.
She's given talks on this as well.

938
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:12,470
But I found it very empowering to
realize at times when I have artificially

939
00:57:12,471 --> 00:57:14,990
isolated myself to be like, I don't want
to burden other people with my shit.

940
00:57:15,330 --> 00:57:18,800
Like let me just figure this out and sit
down and play a notepad and get stuck

941
00:57:18,801 --> 00:57:23,801
in my head and chase my own tail and self
flagellate and make this all worse and

942
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:29,020
then punish myself or feel upset when
I don't figure it all out. Absolutely.

943
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:33,830
And instead it's like, no,
your friends want to help you.

944
00:57:33,831 --> 00:57:38,300
Like give them the gift of allowing
them to help you and your friends.

945
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:39,970
They don't have to be a friend.

946
00:57:40,510 --> 00:57:43,620
Yeah. Even people that I, you
know, along the journey I'm,

947
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:45,400
I kind of have this syndrome where I,

948
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,270
I'm always impressed by everyone and I
don't feel impressive ever. It's just,

949
00:57:49,271 --> 00:57:53,440
it's something I've suffered with my
whole life. And you know, I've just, I've,

950
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:58,300
no matter who it is in front of me, it
literally could be someone that, you know,

951
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:01,550
career wise isn't even on the same,
you know,

952
00:58:01,570 --> 00:58:04,450
kind of contribution
level or whatever it is.

953
00:58:04,451 --> 00:58:07,360
But I'm just always impressed by
people because I think it's so,

954
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:12,040
it's important to really appreciate
everybody else's, you know,

955
00:58:12,041 --> 00:58:14,050
kind of story and where they've come from,
what they're doing.

956
00:58:14,051 --> 00:58:17,650
And so I've always been the last
few years scared, like you said,

957
00:58:17,651 --> 00:58:18,461
I've always been like,
well,

958
00:58:18,461 --> 00:58:22,090
I can't ask that person for advice because
they're so important and they're so

959
00:58:22,091 --> 00:58:24,550
impressive and they're gonna think I'm
annoying or they're going to think that

960
00:58:24,551 --> 00:58:26,440
I'm needy or they're going to think that,
you know what I mean?

961
00:58:26,441 --> 00:58:31,441
And so I've almost dug myself into this
hole of not asking enough people for

962
00:58:31,451 --> 00:58:32,284
help.
Yeah.

963
00:58:32,530 --> 00:58:36,700
And fear of them feeling
invaded or imposed on?

964
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:39,400
Not because I didn't care
about what they had to say,

965
00:58:39,401 --> 00:58:41,980
so that's a really
interesting perspective.

966
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:45,950
Let me give just a couple of thoughts
for people who are like, okay,

967
00:58:46,370 --> 00:58:50,900
I'm going to ask him for advice or ask
you for advice or whatever it might be.

968
00:58:50,901 --> 00:58:54,350
If you're, if you want to ask anyone for
advice who you perceive as very busy.

969
00:58:55,010 --> 00:58:58,070
One recommendation I
would make is do not say,

970
00:58:58,071 --> 00:59:01,240
can I take you out to lunch and pick
your brain? No one has time for lunch.

971
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:02,360
Let's do the brain picking.

972
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:08,100
Sounds awful and nobody wants to do it
because it's really nebulous and so the

973
00:59:08,101 --> 00:59:10,530
concern is I'm going to go
out to knock to be 15 minutes.

974
00:59:10,531 --> 00:59:14,210
It's going to be an hour of them trying
to figure out what they want to say and

975
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:18,290
it's not going to be a good use of
time. So you can, if you can say a,

976
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:19,630
I know you have a thought,

977
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:23,210
I'd get a thousand email if you don't have
time to respond. I totally understand,

978
00:59:23,630 --> 00:59:26,710
but I couldn't think of a
better person to reach out to.

979
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:29,840
Just one thing I'm really struggling with,
here's the situation,

980
00:59:30,110 --> 00:59:34,790
here's what I've tried to do or figure
out already had this is this is this is,

981
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:39,690
I've actually used Google. Yeah, right.
I'm not going to hit [inaudible].

982
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:42,050
I actually looked into it. I've, I've
tried to figure out this and this.

983
00:59:42,290 --> 00:59:46,490
This is where I am. Yup. Super specific
question. And again, if you're too busy,

984
00:59:46,491 --> 00:59:49,010
totally get it. No problem. And
if easier, here's my cell phone.

985
00:59:49,450 --> 00:59:54,450
I think that giving them an out
recognizing they're busier than hell,

986
00:59:54,590 --> 00:59:55,640
which they probably are,

987
00:59:56,660 --> 01:00:01,530
and having a really soft delivery but
showing that you've put in some work. Yes.

988
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:06,100
But you're not outsourcing your like
mechanical Turk stuff to them like yeah.

989
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:09,550
Do you put in some effort and
show that you've done that? So

990
01:00:10,350 --> 01:00:12,820
a follow up to that.
We actually do that in the office.

991
01:00:12,821 --> 01:00:16,330
So what I've told the team and what
the team has really learned in there,

992
01:00:16,331 --> 01:00:19,480
they do it on their own, which is
amazing. If you have a problem,

993
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:23,200
please don't come talk to me about
it unless you have a suggested yeah.

994
01:00:23,230 --> 01:00:25,570
Solution. Exactly. Yes. Absolutely.

995
01:00:25,670 --> 01:00:29,990
I can't just listen to problems come
with two potential solutions. Like,

996
01:00:30,140 --> 01:00:32,320
Hey Whitney, we've got a huge issue. Um,

997
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:36,740
this situation has completely crumbled
and we're committed to this or whatever

998
01:00:36,741 --> 01:00:40,820
happened. My suggested solution
is either a, we do x, Y,

999
01:00:40,821 --> 01:00:45,570
and Z or B, we could do this and here
are the consequences of both. Yup.

1000
01:00:45,710 --> 01:00:49,190
And this is what, um, is going
to happen in each scenario.

1001
01:00:49,490 --> 01:00:52,580
And then we can talk through that and it
goes to show that someone has actually

1002
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:56,720
thought through, you know, the other side
of the fire. How do we get out of here?

1003
01:00:56,721 --> 01:00:59,600
What's the exit strategy? Not
just, Oh, we were in a fire.

1004
01:00:59,670 --> 01:01:02,760
Yeah.
This is so important.

1005
01:01:02,850 --> 01:01:07,850
And if you think of problem solving
as an algorithm or software in a way,

1006
01:01:09,930 --> 01:01:13,860
if you add head count to
say really inefficient,

1007
01:01:14,430 --> 01:01:18,000
a software development project is just
going to make things take longer, right?

1008
01:01:18,001 --> 01:01:21,570
So the more people you have, in a way
you could argue this is really important,

1009
01:01:21,571 --> 01:01:26,370
especially when you have a tiny team,
but the amount of bloat and wasted money,

1010
01:01:26,910 --> 01:01:27,360
uh,

1011
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:32,360
that can really cause problems up
doesn't increase in a linear fashion.

1012
01:01:33,241 --> 01:01:35,250
When you then have a
hundred, 200, 500 people,

1013
01:01:35,251 --> 01:01:38,340
if you have 500 people who haven't
been coached on how to do this,

1014
01:01:38,341 --> 01:01:43,050
it gets even more expensive. And uh,
one thing I'd add to that is yeah,

1015
01:01:43,051 --> 01:01:47,040
this is so important. So when I hire
people part time, contract, full time,

1016
01:01:47,041 --> 01:01:49,470
whatever it might be,
they learn really quickly,

1017
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:52,890
do not come to me a with a problem
without a proposed solution.

1018
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:57,660
And if you come with a proposed solution,
don't give me a 12 item,

1019
01:01:57,661 --> 01:02:02,610
multiple choice questions. Yeah, you
can give me your top three or four.

1020
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:05,700
I also want to know which one do you
think we should do and why this one is the

1021
01:02:05,701 --> 01:02:08,370
best and why have you gotten to that?
And I might disagree with it,

1022
01:02:08,371 --> 01:02:11,820
but it's like put them, I want your top
four options or whatever it might be.

1023
01:02:11,821 --> 01:02:16,350
Three in ranked order and for you to
explain why you think number one is the

1024
01:02:16,351 --> 01:02:18,930
best. Yeah. And then
it's a yes, no, right.

1025
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:23,460
Or now let me take a closer look.
But it's, it saves so much time.

1026
01:02:24,550 --> 01:02:29,250
Uh, and I think what's important to,
to pair that with, and I remember, uh,

1027
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:34,650
Reid Hoffman, so the cofounder of
Linkedin, among many other things. I mean,

1028
01:02:34,651 --> 01:02:38,700
the guy is incredible investor
and critical guys. Couple guys,

1029
01:02:39,390 --> 01:02:42,270
and I'll add, I'll add this. I mean, I've
had him on this podcast so people can,

1030
01:02:42,330 --> 01:02:42,871
can look it up,

1031
01:02:42,871 --> 01:02:47,040
but he's also age from what
I've experienced of him
and many people who have

1032
01:02:47,041 --> 01:02:49,110
experienced a genuinely happy guy.

1033
01:02:49,470 --> 01:02:54,470
It's hard to overstate how rare
that is among a lot of these folks.

1034
01:02:55,681 --> 01:02:56,300
You would use,

1035
01:02:56,300 --> 01:03:00,120
how many people try to get out there and
become successful as a, as a coping or,

1036
01:03:00,121 --> 01:03:02,400
you know, this is gonna make me
happier. This is going to make me happy.

1037
01:03:02,401 --> 01:03:04,600
And then they get to the next level and
they're still not happy and then they

1038
01:03:04,601 --> 01:03:06,450
want to go to the next level.
So that's brilliant.

1039
01:03:06,570 --> 01:03:10,150
Resumes. Yeah. And, uh, and he, uh,

1040
01:03:10,510 --> 01:03:14,190
I mean you taught Wittgenstein classes
at Oxford also like in his spare time.

1041
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:17,380
The dude is amazing. He's done a lot.
And he was the fire, he was called,

1042
01:03:17,381 --> 01:03:22,150
he was referred to as the firefighter
in chief that's right by Peter Teal and

1043
01:03:22,210 --> 01:03:25,660
uh, read, uh,

1044
01:03:25,690 --> 01:03:27,220
hired a,

1045
01:03:27,790 --> 01:03:32,790
a young guy named Ben Casnocha to be his
chief of staff and to handle anything

1046
01:03:33,611 --> 01:03:34,031
and everything.

1047
01:03:34,031 --> 01:03:37,300
It's kind of like an aide to camp position
if anyone from militaries listening.

1048
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:42,550
In any case, what he told Ben Really
early on was, and I'm paraphrasing here,

1049
01:03:42,551 --> 01:03:47,551
but you can have something like a 10
to 20% footfall rate footfalls just a

1050
01:03:48,851 --> 01:03:50,150
tennis or a sports analogy.

1051
01:03:50,170 --> 01:03:53,590
Like you can have a 10 to 20%
error rate for the sake of speed.

1052
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:55,210
Like I want you to move quickly.

1053
01:03:55,211 --> 01:03:58,330
I want you to figure things out on your
own and like you're allowed to make

1054
01:03:58,331 --> 01:03:58,630
mistakes.

1055
01:03:58,630 --> 01:04:03,040
I expect you to make like
10 to 20% mistakes and just
try to not make this your

1056
01:04:03,041 --> 01:04:06,100
margin. And when you tell
people that and advance it,

1057
01:04:06,130 --> 01:04:10,540
it also manages XP to
help manage expectations.

1058
01:04:10,541 --> 01:04:14,200
And it helps to encourage them to do
what both of us are suggesting because

1059
01:04:14,201 --> 01:04:16,300
otherwise they're like, well, I'm,

1060
01:04:17,050 --> 01:04:21,550
if I'm afraid that I'm going
to be punished for making
every mistake or slight

1061
01:04:21,551 --> 01:04:21,980
error,

1062
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:26,110
then I'm going to come to you with to
try to get your opinion on everything

1063
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:30,310
because I don't want to get
that negative right. Uh,

1064
01:04:30,580 --> 01:04:33,860
suffer that negative consequence.
That's really interesting. Yeah. Yeah.

1065
01:04:33,861 --> 01:04:38,030
I read this study, uh, so
just, uh, just a few more, uh,

1066
01:04:38,050 --> 01:04:42,080
what is an unusual habit or an
absurd thing that you love and I'll,

1067
01:04:42,081 --> 01:04:45,880
I'll buy a little bit of time, uh,
because when I say absurd or weird,

1068
01:04:45,881 --> 01:04:48,550
I really do mean weirder. Absurd.
So for instance, and you know,

1069
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:52,080
I take a screenshot anytime
my phone says five 55, because

1070
01:04:52,650 --> 01:04:56,620
lucky number five 55, I screenshot
at five 55. Are you serious?

1071
01:04:56,621 --> 01:05:00,930
I cannot ask my husband. I
screenshot. If anything is by 55, I'm,

1072
01:05:00,931 --> 01:05:05,860
I'm a Weirdo with the number five. If I
see a door that is like five, five, five,

1073
01:05:06,010 --> 01:05:09,280
I do the same thing. I swear to
you. That's crazy. I'm not kidding.

1074
01:05:09,281 --> 01:05:13,350
I promise I've ever run into anyone else.
I have a freak thing with fives.

1075
01:05:13,890 --> 01:05:16,570
All right. Well we've, the
universe has brought us here.

1076
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:22,120
That's crazy. No. All
right. So that's one. Uh,

1077
01:05:22,270 --> 01:05:23,770
then you have someone
like say Cheryl strayed,

1078
01:05:23,771 --> 01:05:27,610
who wrote wild and a hugely impressive
woman's written a lot more than that.

1079
01:05:28,030 --> 01:05:32,650
She'll rearrange sandwiches because she
wants every bite to contain every layer

1080
01:05:32,651 --> 01:05:33,760
of said sandwich.
I could,

1081
01:05:33,761 --> 01:05:36,820
she doesn't want there to be a clump
of avocado on one half and so on.

1082
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:40,750
I get that. Right. But
it's understandable. It's
still pretty weird. Uh,

1083
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:42,360
so besides you're screenshotting,

1084
01:05:42,490 --> 01:05:46,440
what other odd habits or
absurd things do you do? I love

1085
01:05:46,770 --> 01:05:51,300
people think this is absurd. I just think
it's sweet. But, um, I guess I'm not,

1086
01:05:51,390 --> 01:05:52,620
I'm different.

1087
01:05:52,890 --> 01:05:56,400
I cannot sleep at night unless I text
my mom goodnight and say I love you. Oh,

1088
01:05:56,401 --> 01:06:00,900
that's sweet. I've been doing it since
I left home. I cannot sleep at night.

1089
01:06:01,380 --> 01:06:03,630
I have to like last
night I was so exhausted.

1090
01:06:03,631 --> 01:06:08,631
I had been doing south by stuff all day
and literally I had to roll over and get

1091
01:06:09,181 --> 01:06:11,040
my phone and say, Goodnight
Mommy, I love you.

1092
01:06:11,070 --> 01:06:13,890
I just can't go to sleep without doing it.
I know it sounds kind of crazy.

1093
01:06:13,891 --> 01:06:17,280
I'm literally a grown woman.
I was 28 years old. I just,

1094
01:06:17,281 --> 01:06:21,780
I just would never be able to live with
myself if the next day came and you

1095
01:06:21,781 --> 01:06:23,970
don't get to see your mom
again for whatever reason.

1096
01:06:23,971 --> 01:06:25,980
And I just have to say goodnight
and tell her I love her.

1097
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:30,400
Great practice. And you could argue it's
even more important the older you get.

1098
01:06:30,490 --> 01:06:33,220
And that is, I would
recommend everybody, people,

1099
01:06:33,460 --> 01:06:35,720
people who have listened to
this for a long time, a podcast,

1100
01:06:35,721 --> 01:06:39,850
you're gonna be sick of hearing this,
but read the tail end by Tim urban please.

1101
01:06:39,950 --> 01:06:44,200
It really paints an incredible picture
in a sense of urgency as it relates to

1102
01:06:44,201 --> 01:06:46,720
interacting with your parents.
And I think the number is something like,

1103
01:06:46,721 --> 01:06:50,140
by the time you graduate from
a May even be high school,

1104
01:06:50,141 --> 01:06:51,190
I don't even think it's college.

1105
01:06:51,230 --> 01:06:55,060
You have like 300 days or something
that you've spent 80 plus percent of the

1106
01:06:55,061 --> 01:06:56,940
time you will ever spend with
your parents before they die.

1107
01:06:57,010 --> 01:06:59,980
Something like that makes
me like, and uh, so yeah,

1108
01:06:59,981 --> 01:07:01,120
I think more people should do that.

1109
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:01,991
So yeah,

1110
01:07:01,991 --> 01:07:04,870
I guess you could call that upstart
because you don't hear a lot of a lot of

1111
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:08,200
adults doing that.
So it's probably classified as absurd.

1112
01:07:08,201 --> 01:07:12,250
But I do think that it's important, you
know, and no matter how busy you get,

1113
01:07:12,251 --> 01:07:13,810
or no matter where you are in the world,

1114
01:07:14,270 --> 01:07:16,540
but what's more important
than your family? Nothing.

1115
01:07:18,310 --> 01:07:20,080
Yes.
Yeah.

1116
01:07:20,420 --> 01:07:23,820
That have a lot of close friends pass
away this past 12 months in it's,

1117
01:07:23,830 --> 01:07:28,030
and almost all of them are entirely
unexpected. So you just don't know yet.

1118
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:31,630
You just don't know when your time is
up or someone else's. So don't Save,

1119
01:07:31,870 --> 01:07:36,760
don't save that stuff. Uh, in the
last few years, could be five years,

1120
01:07:36,761 --> 01:07:41,200
two years, doesn't really
matter. But what new belief,

1121
01:07:41,260 --> 01:07:44,230
habit, behavior, tool,

1122
01:07:44,231 --> 01:07:49,231
anything has most positively impacted
your life personally and not the company

1123
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:56,500
that your employees, but you, is
there any new habit or belief,

1124
01:07:57,400 --> 01:08:00,160
uh,
breakthrough breakdown,

1125
01:08:00,220 --> 01:08:05,200
anything that has ultimately ended up
having a very strong positive impact on

1126
01:08:05,201 --> 01:08:06,034
your life?

1127
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:09,650
That's a really good
question. Um, you know what?

1128
01:08:10,050 --> 01:08:14,520
Turning my phone off from time to time,
genuinely, that's helped me a lot.

1129
01:08:14,521 --> 01:08:18,020
I think I've this insane tech
addiction over the last few years,

1130
01:08:18,021 --> 01:08:22,370
just bumble is on my phone.
I mean literally everything
goes through my phone.

1131
01:08:22,371 --> 01:08:25,730
I'm communicating with people all day,
every day and it's nonstop.

1132
01:08:25,731 --> 01:08:27,560
And so turning it off,

1133
01:08:27,561 --> 01:08:31,270
putting it in a drawer for 30 minutes
is actually really helpful. All right,

1134
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:36,260
so last or second to last question is if
you get put, can't be an advertisement,

1135
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:40,250
but a word, a phrase, a quote, question,

1136
01:08:40,251 --> 01:08:41,990
anything on a billboard.

1137
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:45,680
So metaphorically getting this out
to millions or billions of people,

1138
01:08:46,820 --> 01:08:48,980
what might you put? Well, we did it.

1139
01:08:49,130 --> 01:08:52,850
We put be the CEO your parents always
wanted you to marry and we put that on

1140
01:08:52,851 --> 01:08:53,840
bunch of billboards everywhere.

1141
01:08:53,841 --> 01:08:56,870
We actually asked that exact
question in the office.

1142
01:08:56,900 --> 01:09:00,180
If we could share one message with the
world and we had a budget to do it,

1143
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:04,280
well we put up there and that was really
the sentiment that our team landed on.

1144
01:09:04,820 --> 01:09:06,980
It just speaks to everything
we're trying to do with bumble.

1145
01:09:06,981 --> 01:09:11,981
We want to encourage women to be equals
and to be seen as equal and in any court

1146
01:09:12,811 --> 01:09:15,560
ship through friendship or
business or love, whatever that is,

1147
01:09:16,010 --> 01:09:20,750
to really feel empowered and confident
and to get out there and be whatever they

1148
01:09:20,751 --> 01:09:23,210
want to be. Not Go and try
to find that in someone else.

1149
01:09:23,510 --> 01:09:27,050
You can find that in someone
else but tried to do within. Also

1150
01:09:28,850 --> 01:09:31,490
Whitney, thank you so
much. Thank you so much.

1151
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:34,190
Where can people say hello to you?

1152
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:38,650
Best places to wave a hand on the
Internet. Check out what you're up to.

1153
01:09:38,670 --> 01:09:43,250
As long as you're going to be nice on the
Internet, come to Instagram. Um, but no,

1154
01:09:43,251 --> 01:09:44,084
everybody

1155
01:09:45,810 --> 01:09:50,450
wolf heard and I would encourage
everybody to check out bumble.

1156
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:53,330
We've added friend finding business
connections and everything.

1157
01:09:53,331 --> 01:09:56,060
So I think that would be a great
thing for people to go check out.

1158
01:09:56,690 --> 01:09:58,250
And for everybody listening,
I will link

1159
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:03,480
everything in the show notes as per usual
and she can find a tim.blog/podcast.

1160
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:07,240
And until next time,
thank you for listening and watching.

1161
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:12,250
Hey guys, this is Tim again. Just a
few more things before you take off.

1162
01:10:12,610 --> 01:10:15,250
Number one,
this is five bullet Friday.

1163
01:10:15,580 --> 01:10:18,520
Do you want to get a short email from me?

1164
01:10:18,550 --> 01:10:22,690
Would you enjoy getting a short email
from me every Friday that provides a

1165
01:10:22,691 --> 01:10:26,260
little more soul of fun before the
weekend and five bullet Friday is a very

1166
01:10:26,261 --> 01:10:30,580
short email where I share the coolest
things I've found or that I've been

1167
01:10:30,581 --> 01:10:31,870
pondering over the week.

1168
01:10:32,110 --> 01:10:34,870
That could include favorite new
albums that I've discovered.

1169
01:10:34,871 --> 01:10:38,350
It could include Gizmos and gadgets
and all sorts of weird shit that I've

1170
01:10:38,351 --> 01:10:42,640
somehow dug up in the uh,
the world of the esoteric as I do.

1171
01:10:42,940 --> 01:10:47,940
It could include favorite articles that
I've read and that I've shared with my

1172
01:10:48,581 --> 01:10:51,310
close friends for instance.
And it's very short.

1173
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:56,380
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness
before you head off for the weekend.

1174
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:58,630
So if you want to receive that,
check it out.

1175
01:10:58,900 --> 01:11:02,050
Just go to four hour work
week.com that's four hour work,

1176
01:11:02,051 --> 01:11:06,250
week.com all spelled out and just drop
in your email and you will get the very

1177
01:11:06,251 --> 01:11:08,800
next one. And if you sign
up, I hope you enjoy it.

1178
01:11:09,730 --> 01:11:14,130
This episode is brought to you by
[inaudible] dot com the world's on demand

1179
01:11:14,131 --> 01:11:15,420
massage service.

1180
01:11:15,990 --> 01:11:20,970
I've been broken so many times over the
years that I usually have body work done

1181
01:11:20,971 --> 01:11:22,860
at least once a week.
I have a very,

1182
01:11:22,861 --> 01:11:27,570
very high bar for this type of thing and
I was very skeptical of sooth until I

1183
01:11:27,571 --> 01:11:28,920
tested them.
Not once,

1184
01:11:29,340 --> 01:11:34,230
but I would say at least a dozen times
around the country in different cities.

1185
01:11:34,350 --> 01:11:39,300
I do not accept anything less than
excellent for any type of soft tissue

1186
01:11:39,301 --> 01:11:44,301
treatment and I would not suggest that
you accept anything less than excellent.

1187
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:49,200
So I can affirm personally
that sooth delivers a licensed,

1188
01:11:49,201 --> 01:11:54,180
experienced and above all effective in
my book massage therapist and the comfort

1189
01:11:54,181 --> 01:11:58,110
of your own home hotel or
office in as little as an hour,

1190
01:11:58,111 --> 01:12:02,230
so you can think of it as
Uber for massages available
and 55 cities worldwide at

1191
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:05,550
this point across the US,
UK, Canada, and Australia,

1192
01:12:05,551 --> 01:12:08,880
so you can relax just about any time,
any where,

1193
01:12:09,330 --> 01:12:12,990
and I've tried many different types of
massage that they offer in the process is

1194
01:12:12,991 --> 01:12:13,830
super,
super simple.

1195
01:12:14,310 --> 01:12:19,310
Download the sue the APP that's s o o t
h e or go to [inaudible] dot com choose

1196
01:12:19,381 --> 01:12:22,290
the kind of massage you want.
You can slice Swedish sports,

1197
01:12:22,350 --> 01:12:24,390
deep tissue or even couples massage.

1198
01:12:24,810 --> 01:12:29,040
I usually do deep tissue myself or I'll
do couple's massage and then tell both

1199
01:12:29,041 --> 01:12:33,300
of the therapists that I'm actually
intending to get a four handed massage

1200
01:12:33,301 --> 01:12:36,600
instead of having two people get
to massages, if that makes sense.

1201
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:40,770
Then you set the length of your massage,
whether 60 90 or 120 minutes.

1202
01:12:41,070 --> 01:12:42,360
If you're looking to get fixed,

1203
01:12:42,361 --> 01:12:47,361
I usually do 90 or ideally 120 you select
the gender of your therapist and then

1204
01:12:47,791 --> 01:12:51,390
boom, you're done and you will
see who picks up the call.

1205
01:12:51,810 --> 01:12:56,810
The service is available from 8:00 AM
to midnight and suit brings everything

1206
01:12:56,851 --> 01:13:00,840
that you need to create a spa experience
in your home and the therapist handles

1207
01:13:00,841 --> 01:13:04,620
all of this, the massage table, linens,
oils, music, the whole nine yards.

1208
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:08,610
So try it out, download, soothe

This episode is brought to you
by fresh books, man. Oh Man.

1214
01:13:27,931 --> 01:13:32,400
Do a lot of listeners of this podcast
and readers of mine love fresh books to

1215
01:13:32,401 --> 01:13:36,060
the extent that I ended up meeting
with the CEO not very long ago.

1216
01:13:36,570 --> 01:13:38,190
Why are they so popular?
Well,

1217
01:13:38,370 --> 01:13:42,360
they are the number one cloud accounting
software design exclusively for self

1218
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:44,460
employed professionals.
That's many of you.

1219

And use by more than 10 million people.
You can send invoices, track your time,

1220
01:13:48,450 --> 01:13:52,470
and get paid very, very quickly, which
suits the needs of a lot of freelancers,

1221
01:13:52,471 --> 01:13:55,110
a lot of bumps.
By putting the willows and beyond.

1222
01:13:55,710 --> 01:13:57,390
You can't take pictures of receipts.

1223
01:13:57,391 --> 01:14:00,000
You can link your credit card and
debit card so all the things you buy

1224
01:14:00,001 --> 01:14:04,320
automatically appear in your
fresh books in the right category,

1225
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:09,000
so on and so forth. Makes
taxes easy, makes invoices
easy, makes your life easier.

1226
01:14:09,330 --> 01:14:12,190
And also in fact recommend a pdf.

1227
01:14:12,610 --> 01:14:14,050
They didn't ask me to
read this part by the way.

1228
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:18,910
They'd put the other pdf
awhile back called breaking
the time barrier. Subtitle,

1229
01:14:18,911 --> 01:14:21,940
how to unlock your true earning potential
so you can search for breaking the

1230
01:14:21,941 --> 01:14:24,160
time barrier.
A lot of people ask me,

1231
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:28,810
how can I get a four hour work week with
the service business and the story in

1232
01:14:28,811 --> 01:14:32,410
that Ebook, it's pdf is the short
answer is really, really good.

1233
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:35,170
So I think you should also check that out.
So bringing the time error,

1234
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:38,800
