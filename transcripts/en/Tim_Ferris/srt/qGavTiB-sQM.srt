1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,820
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02,821 --> 00:00:06,150
I can run flat out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,660
Now it does seem like

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,580
I'm a cybernetic organism,
living tissue over.

5
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,580
So it is brought to you by a new sponsor.
So listen up folks.

6
00:00:26,581 --> 00:00:30,540
This is a good one because have you ever
wanted to be as powerful as a bullet

7
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:35,541
wearing Ninja from an 1980s movie or as
flamboyant as big gay Al Big Al in south

8
00:00:36,991 --> 00:00:41,070
park or a sleek as a black panther
in the Amazon on the hunt wealth?

9
00:00:41,071 --> 00:00:45,150
There's great news because I've been
testing this product that you wrap around

10
00:00:45,151 --> 00:00:48,540
your genitals and it makes you feel
like a superhero and it is called

11
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:49,380
[inaudible].

12
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,950
I've spent the last two to three weeks
traveling with underwear from these guys

13
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,230
and they are comfy.
I gotta tell you,

14
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,880
it feels like a Geisha has giving your
groin a hug and it's not just for dudes.

15
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:04,590
But if you go to [inaudible] dot com

uh, I will also highlight my favorite,

19
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,900
you'll probably be able
to guess which it is.

20
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,550
These underwear made from micro Medallia,

21
00:01:18,551 --> 00:01:22,920
which is extruded from Austrian
beechwood trees in the Alps. Yes. Fancy.

scientifically tested using the
[inaudible] method developed in Kyoto.

24
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:33,300
And you know, those Japanese very

Hello my dangerous dainty friends.
This Tim Ferriss,

48
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:05,150
and this is another episode of the Tim
Ferriss Show where I try my best to

49
00:03:05,591 --> 00:03:09,070
deconstruct excellence and
world class performers.

50
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,800
That means interviewing people
who are the best at what they do,

51
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:16,930
or one of the best of what
they do, whether they're
investors or chess, prodigies,

52
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:20,110
actors, athletes, everyone in,

53
00:03:20,111 --> 00:03:22,750
anyone who fits the bill of top performer.

54
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,460
I will try to dig into the habits,
the routines,

55
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:31,540
the favorite books, the meals, the
mule timing, their sleep habits,

56
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:35,800
meditation techniques and so on and so
forth to provide you with recipes that

57
00:03:35,801 --> 00:03:37,000
you can test.

58
00:03:37,001 --> 00:03:41,980
So not a whole bunch of
Highfalutin abstract concepts,

59
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,900
although we explore some deep stuff.

60
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:48,370
But the really tactical tools
that you can implement on a daily,

61
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,940
weekly basis to become better at
whatever you do or want to do.

62
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,660
And this episode is no exception.
We have Whitney Cummings,

63
00:03:54,661 --> 00:03:57,100
so Whitney is hilarious.

64
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:01,780
Whitney is a Los Angeles based
comedian, actor, writer and producer.

65
00:04:01,781 --> 00:04:04,540
She's a multihyphenate.
And uh,

66
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:07,550
let me rattle off just a few things.
Uh,

67
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:11,410
she's executive producer end along with
Michael Patrick King cocreator of the

68
00:04:11,411 --> 00:04:12,940
Emmy nominated CBS comedy.

69
00:04:12,941 --> 00:04:17,740
Two broke girls not to
broke curls are a lot of ks,

70
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:21,340
two broke girls. You've
probably seen it, heard of it,

71
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,300
observed the advertisements for
it. It's all over the place. Uh,

72
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:28,660
which was recently picked up for
a fifth season. She also wrote,

73
00:04:28,661 --> 00:04:30,070
produced and starred in Whitney,

74
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:35,040
which aired on NBC from
2011 to 2013 not only that,

75
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:38,980
outside of television she has headlined
with comics including Sarah Silverman,

76
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:43,090
Louie Ck, Amy Schumer, Aziz
Ansari and many others.

77
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:44,620
Lots of big names.

78
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:49,830
She's famous for some other skills that
will explore like roasting other comics

79
00:04:51,371 --> 00:04:52,450
and celebrities.

80
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,620
That is a fascinating and fun conversation
that we dug into her first one hour

81
00:04:56,621 --> 00:04:58,300
stand up,
special money shot,

82
00:04:58,301 --> 00:05:02,230
premiered on comedy central and 2010
and was nominated for an American comedy

83
00:05:02,231 --> 00:05:04,930
award. Her second standup
special Whitney Cummings.

84
00:05:04,931 --> 00:05:09,931
I love you debuted on comedy central and
2014 and she is shooting a third hour

85
00:05:10,241 --> 00:05:11,710
for HBO this August,

86
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:16,860
which is set to air in 2016 in this
conversation and we talk about her process

87
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:22,480
for writing both comedy and other types
of writing difference between fiction

88
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:27,100
and nonfiction, we get really granular
on how she develops her jokes.

89
00:05:27,101 --> 00:05:30,850
I asked her questions like, if you had
eight weeks to take someone, I, he,

90
00:05:30,851 --> 00:05:33,160
me who's terrified of standup,

91
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:38,290
no experience to get them ready for a
real performance, what would those a week,

92
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,270
eight weeks of training look like?

93
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:44,770
And we also turn back the clock,
look at her childhood,

94
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:48,130
look at the things that have formed her
and informed her of the mistakes that

95
00:05:48,131 --> 00:05:51,290
she's made, managing other
people, Lessons learned, uh,

96
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:56,230
because she's had massive teams, hundreds
of people, which I did not know. Uh,

97
00:05:56,231 --> 00:06:01,231
and we even delve into some very esoteric
stuff like equine therapy using horses

98
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:06,440
for therapeutic work. Really
fascinating. I love this conversation.

99
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:11,210
I hope you do as well.
And she is,

100
00:06:11,211 --> 00:06:13,430
I've added funding lady making me laugh.

101
00:06:13,431 --> 00:06:16,790
So I hope you enjoy Whitney Cummings.

102
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:21,260
And I usually say without further ado,
Whitney Cummings,

103
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:24,500
but I've said when he come, he was
like 17 times already in this intro.

104
00:06:24,501 --> 00:06:26,840
So Whitney cat makes Whitney Cummings,

105
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,900
Whitney Cummings like Candyman enjoy

106
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:36,460
Whitney. Dear, thank you so much for
being on the show. Thank you sir.

107
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,540
Like I caught you opening your beaches.

108
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:43,390
Look, I'm really into beverages. I
don't know if you noticed this about me.

109
00:06:43,391 --> 00:06:48,280
It's my weird collection. I think I'm a
hoarder. Uh, I'm really into hydrating,

110
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:52,780
but like sneakily sell like nefarious
hydration. It can never be actual water.

111
00:06:52,781 --> 00:06:55,870
It's always like something just a,
they cost $8.

112
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:00,990
Right? We'll beat you us of, and a lot
of endurance athletes are big on beaches.

113
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,430
That's what I'm here to tell you.

114
00:07:02,431 --> 00:07:06,190
I said I've made my transition into
being an intern. That's my new,

115
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,160
that's why you were grilling. Yep. Yeah.

116
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:12,000
Like American Ninja Warrior competitor
who wandered water to the living room.

117
00:07:12,001 --> 00:07:13,700
Some of your questions and uh,
yeah.

118
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,130
Yeah, no, I um,

119
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:20,400
I feel like I didn't make a lot of great
health decisions in my early twenties

120
00:07:21,821 --> 00:07:26,500
so I feel like I'm overcompensating
now with, you know, things like this

121
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:29,480
better than going the other
direction right here. Like,
you know, I was so healthy,

122
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,230
I was so orthorexic I
was competitive athletes.

123
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:37,540
I feel like our parents just
kind of dropped the ball. I mean,

124
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:41,350
now that we know so much about
GMOs and high fructose corn syrup,

125
00:07:41,351 --> 00:07:43,150
I feel like I'm like on borrowed time.

126
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,650
Well,
I think that maybe they dropped the ball,

127
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,200
but they didn't know they were carrying
the ball in the first place or percent.

128
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:51,220
Yes. They didn't know that they
have plausible deniability. Right.

129
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:54,740
That'd be like a saw my fault that I gave
you chicken mcnuggets so why I smoked

130
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:58,490
when I was pregnant. Krispy Kreme. Oh,
exactly. The fruity pebbles every morning

131
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,820
go pubs here, right. Breakfast,
lunch and dinner. Um,

132
00:08:01,821 --> 00:08:05,810
so I feel like I'm kind of like trying
to rectify a lot of that damage that was

133
00:08:05,811 --> 00:08:06,590
done.

134
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:10,310
So, oh, look at this. I
just noticed. So I love you.

135
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,540
How is that on your arm?
And I've got that for you.

136
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,180
I have something else to tell you.

137
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,650
Pull of the exciting
confessions right off the bat

138
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:22,460
that you just said, uh, because as,
um, what you guys can't see, hopefully,

139
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:23,870
unless you're Weirdo Stalker,

140
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:28,900
I have a white tattoo on my lower left
forearm that says I love you and I don't

141
00:08:29,901 --> 00:08:34,100
think anyone has ever noticed it without
me having to point it out. How is that?

142
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,540
That's so interesting. Reduce. I have
another white one right here. Uh, oh yeah.

143
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:41,990
It's an anchor. Um, be, it's basically,

144
00:08:41,991 --> 00:08:44,540
this is like someone who's
incredibly commitment phobic,

145
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:48,430
who wants a tattoo but doesn't want
anybody to see it. Um, so that's, yeah,

146
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:48,500
so that's

147
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,080
one of my weaknesses.
But is it,

148
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:54,740
is it done with an electric needle
without any ink? Nope. With white ink,

149
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:56,130
but it has to go much

150
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:59,300
deeper. So it's more like scarification
so basically hurts like twice.

151
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,680
So I am fascinated by that.

152
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,360
Twice as much pain,

153
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:08,100
but half the recognition sounds
like a lot of business ideas.

154
00:09:08,101 --> 00:09:11,810
I've had worst investment Basel. Okay.

155
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:15,640
The, that's fascinating to me because
I've never seen a tattoo like that before.

156
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:18,660
But I read when I was in
Japan as an exchange student,

157
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,950
my first time abroad when I was 15,

158
00:09:20,951 --> 00:09:25,951
I became obsessed with Yakuza tattoos
and sort of deep traditional tattoos that

159
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:31,570
were associated with organized crime.
And I read about this type of Tattoo,

160
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,460
which is pretty much exactly
what you have on your arm.

161
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:38,200
They would only become visible when the
skin was flush at, say, the public baths.

162
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:38,830
Wow.

163
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:41,380
So if they wanted to keep it under wraps
that they were organized crime member,

164
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:44,110
but then wanted to scare the shit out of
everybody when they're in naked in the

165
00:09:44,111 --> 00:09:46,880
baths. Wow. You'll have
like full back white tech.

166
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:50,750
That is so cool. It's almost like
black light tattoos today or something.

167
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,610
I don't even know what a
black with a black light,

168
00:09:52,611 --> 00:09:54,590
you can do a black light tattoo.
This is mostly for,

169
00:09:54,591 --> 00:09:57,230
I guess people who do Lsd
and did like special k,

170
00:09:57,231 --> 00:10:00,440
but you can do it with black light ink so
you can only see it in her black lives.

171
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,690
This gotta be good for you.
Yeah.

172
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:05,420
This is so funny because I wrote my senior
honors thesis in college on Tattooing.

173
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:06,543
Really?
Yeah.

174
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:11,720
So I've, uh, no, I think you
also have, if I saw correctly,

175
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:14,240
something on the back of
one of your arms. Yes, yes.

176
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:17,840
I have a safety pin on
the back of my right arm,

177
00:10:17,841 --> 00:10:21,950
which I always forget I have because I
hid it so well that I always forget it's

178
00:10:21,951 --> 00:10:26,870
there. But what is the story of the
safety pins? Safety pin is sort of um, uh,

179
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,990
well the I love you is first uh,
for you Tim.

180
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:36,370
Thank you. I wanted to subtly, it's
really a requirement for podcast guests.

181
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:40,340
This is what I have it really divulged
sign the release. You get the Tattoo,

182
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,820
then we can talk. Right, right.
I've been Brandon, um, I got the,

183
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:47,510
well let me do them in order. I got
the anchor right here. I'm on my wrist.

184
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:50,900
Michael Patrick King and I created
a show called two broke girls,

185
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:53,570
which is on CBS. Michael Patrick
King, you know, did sex in the city.

186
00:10:53,571 --> 00:10:56,100
If you had a girlfriend at the time
you probably had to watch it. Uh,

187
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:00,470
he did a show called the comeback,
which is a brilliant show.

188
00:11:00,471 --> 00:11:01,550
It is so well done.

189
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:04,820
I'm sort of about an aging actress in
Hollywood and sexism in Hollywood and it's

190
00:11:04,821 --> 00:11:09,660
just, it's just incredibly well
written and performed and a,

191
00:11:09,661 --> 00:11:13,670
we did two broke girls together, a
simultaneous, I was doing a show on NBC,

192
00:11:13,671 --> 00:11:15,980
which was a Sitcom as well as a talk show.

193
00:11:15,981 --> 00:11:17,990
So I was doing three shows simultaneously,

194
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:22,010
which doing one is already going to say
glutton for punishment, Herculean task.

195
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:25,280
So, um, so I was just, I
was having a hard time, um,

196
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:29,750
I dealt with some just, you
know, as a comedian, you know,

197
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:32,570
you become a comedian because you
want people to like you, you know,

198
00:11:32,571 --> 00:11:35,930
and then all of a sudden you're sort
of thrust into the zeitgeists is like a

199
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,960
public figure and then, you know,
not everyone's gonna like you,

200
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:42,110
which in standup is usually a good
thing because that means you're being

201
00:11:42,111 --> 00:11:46,340
specific, you know, as you, I believe,
say, uh, when you try to please everybody,

202
00:11:46,341 --> 00:11:49,850
you please no one. Right. Exactly. So the
idea is you want to polarize some people,

203
00:11:49,851 --> 00:11:51,260
but then all of a sudden
its critics are like,

204
00:11:51,261 --> 00:11:54,640
wait a second and then you recreate your
childhood circumstances and you're like,

205
00:11:54,641 --> 00:11:55,720
Dad,
I mean,

206
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:00,160
critics just become your dad who won't
accept you or your mom whose approval

207
00:12:00,161 --> 00:12:03,880
you're trying to get. So you just sort
of time travel back and to being a kid.

208
00:12:03,881 --> 00:12:08,590
And so that was really hard
on me. And then, uh, I just
kind of eviscerated myself.

209
00:12:08,591 --> 00:12:13,591
I did everything wrong in terms of
being a boss and managing my time and

210
00:12:14,261 --> 00:12:17,440
managing people's Egos
and depleting myself,

211
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:20,320
which I've learned a lot in the last
thing you were working on when I was

212
00:12:20,321 --> 00:12:23,830
working on these three shoes, I was the
perfect example of what to never do.

213
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,590
This is before I knew about
you before I, you know, had a,

214
00:12:26,591 --> 00:12:31,000
I'm in a 12 step program for
codependence called Alanen. Uh,

215
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:33,340
and I do trauma therapy now.
I do all this stuff, whatever.

216
00:12:33,341 --> 00:12:38,170
But this was before I had any kind of
that recovery or had done any work on my

217
00:12:38,171 --> 00:12:39,490
sort of neuropathways.

218
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,450
I was using a lot of really old survival
skills and I was like people pleasing

219
00:12:43,451 --> 00:12:47,140
and caretaking and I couldn't fire anyone
and I was terrified to tell someone no

220
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:50,370
and I couldn't have uncomfortable
conversations and uh,

221
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:54,070
I was all of a sudden the boss of
like 400 people and I, it's a lot,

222
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:54,940
it's a lot of people.

223
00:12:55,180 --> 00:13:00,050
I was not the number x three different
show I've worked on big TV shows,

224
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:04,240
a TV show. It is very,
very minimal. 400 people.

225
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:07,630
It's a lot of people too. I mean it
was just between three different shows.

226
00:13:07,631 --> 00:13:09,340
I have three staffs, 200 each, you know,

227
00:13:09,341 --> 00:13:11,640
it was probably more like
600 over the year. Um,

228
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:16,730
and they're all looking to you for
clarity and being decisive and just saying

229
00:13:16,751 --> 00:13:20,440
yes or no instead of well, I just,
I feel like I'm so sorry. It just,

230
00:13:20,441 --> 00:13:24,890
I was so apologetic and so, you know,
desperate for everyone's approval, um,

231
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,470
which makes a great comedian,
terrible boss. And uh,

232
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,030
and so I was just having a really hard
time and I remember Michael Patrick King,

233
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,720
who's sort of one of my mentors, he gave
me a ring that had a, a anchor on it.

234
00:13:34,721 --> 00:13:38,200
Just sort of that, you know, who's like,
just stay grounded, stay in your shoes.

235
00:13:38,201 --> 00:13:41,410
Because anytime someone would come would
come to me, I would just like abandoned,

236
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,011
you know,

237
00:13:42,011 --> 00:13:45,670
myself and just jump out of my skin to
try and take care of them and manage them

238
00:13:45,671 --> 00:13:49,180
and please them instead of just
keeping my feet on the ground.

239
00:13:49,181 --> 00:13:51,400
And then of course, I
promptly lost the ring. Uh,

240
00:13:51,401 --> 00:13:54,850
so I decided to get the tattoo
of it in white of course,

241
00:13:54,851 --> 00:13:56,260
because being on television,

242
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,170
you have to go in like an hour
early to get tattoos covered.

243
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:02,470
And I don't want to give up, you know,
an hour a day, five hours of my week.

244
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:06,880
That's five minutes. That's it,
right. Every, yeah. Every, you know,

245
00:14:06,881 --> 00:14:09,490
an hour a day times five days
a week. Yeah. That's, you know,

246
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,870
five hours of tattoo covering, which I
just don't have time. So hence the white.

247
00:14:13,871 --> 00:14:16,690
And then the safety pin was
sort of, um, I grew up in,

248
00:14:16,691 --> 00:14:18,950
this is not funny and we're
going to get funny. Uh,

249
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:23,230
and you kind of to be in kind of
an unsafe environment. And, uh,

250
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:27,340
my parents would argue a lot when I
was a kid and I used to play with,

251
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:30,970
we didn't have a lot of money.
I was poor safety pins where my toys,

252
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:34,270
I just remember playing with safety pins
and I remember opening them and closing

253
00:14:34,271 --> 00:14:38,470
them. And I just remember that was
just, I did Emdr, which is like a, um,

254
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,360
a trauma thing, movement,
eye movement, uh,

255
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:46,120
deeper desensitized desensitization.

256
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:50,170
You can say that word station
and reprogramming. Got It.

257
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,280
Involves eye movements

258
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:55,430
for overcoming trauma or sure.

259
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:59,850
Basically Reprogram your trauma in terms
of putting them into putting a trauma

260
00:14:59,851 --> 00:15:01,810
to a different folder,
like in layman's terms.

261
00:15:01,811 --> 00:15:04,870
So the way that my trauma
therapist explained it to me was,

262
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:08,400
you remember the episode and I love Lucy
when there was the conveyor belts. Sure.

263
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:12,880
Of was it the bon bons or
was it bottles with gloves?

264
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:14,230
I want to see it was bottles.

265
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,630
I want to say it was bottles and
she was putting the glove on it.

266
00:15:16,631 --> 00:15:18,130
That was in the open.
But anyways,

267
00:15:18,131 --> 00:15:22,150
so she explains it as our brains taken 3
billion pieces of information a second.

268
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:26,710
Right. So, you know, Tim shirt is,
you know, camouflage and how he feels,

269
00:15:26,711 --> 00:15:30,760
how he looks, how this house
feels, trampoline outside.
That's the longer story.

270
00:15:30,761 --> 00:15:35,200
Listeners is the trampoline that all I
want to do is leave this podcast to go

271
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:39,820
jump on it. Um, and, uh, and then when
we get traumatized, her brain freezes.

272
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:42,040
Uh,
but the information keeps coming in.

273
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:45,790
So if right now someone came in and
held up a gun to our heads, right,

274
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:50,470
the information would still come in
white walls, wood in a apple computer,

275
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,640
this cactus, and then it would be
filed into the folder of trauma. Right.

276
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:55,420
So later in five years,

277
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:58,000
I'm sitting at dinner and all of a sudden
there's a cactus and I'm anxious and

278
00:15:58,001 --> 00:16:01,270
stressed out and I don't know why
exactly. And I'm triggered, you know,

279
00:16:01,271 --> 00:16:04,690
so it's like reprogramming some of those
triggers into a folder that is more

280
00:16:04,691 --> 00:16:06,220
benign. Got It. Essentially.

281
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:11,340
And so did the tattoo
come after that Emdr? Yes.

282
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:12,990
Yes. Got It. Yeah.

283
00:16:12,991 --> 00:16:15,720
When I started doing EMDR and sort
of like getting into sort of like,

284
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:20,640
um, neurological recovery
essentially from trauma and was the,

285
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:26,370
was the safety pin a trigger
for negative feelings?

286
00:16:26,371 --> 00:16:29,060
And if so, why did you choose to put
on your arm? That's interesting. It was

287
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:32,120
kind of my, and it wasn't
necessarily a trigger for me.

288
00:16:32,121 --> 00:16:35,250
I think it was more like a symbol
for me of sort of a time. And the,

289
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,710
I think this is sounds kind of Corny,

290
00:16:36,711 --> 00:16:40,310
but like it was open when I was a kid
and I would sort of like, you know,

291
00:16:40,311 --> 00:16:42,770
not in like a masochistic way,

292
00:16:42,771 --> 00:16:45,050
but I was sort of like pricked
myself with it when things would get,

293
00:16:45,051 --> 00:16:47,840
it was just like a tick kind of like as
someone bites her nails or something.

294
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:50,240
And so I sort of closed it.

295
00:16:50,241 --> 00:16:53,450
So the tattoo is a closed
safety pen that's sort of
like you're safe. It's over.

296
00:16:53,451 --> 00:16:56,000
Cause a lot of times if you have
any kind of trauma as a kid,

297
00:16:56,001 --> 00:16:58,730
you become an adult and you constantly
are recreating our childhood

298
00:16:58,731 --> 00:17:01,070
circumstances and having
these completely obsolete,

299
00:17:01,071 --> 00:17:05,030
inappropriate feelings to present
situation. So I had, uh, you know,

300
00:17:05,031 --> 00:17:09,350
it was working with somebody who triggered
all these feelings that my family of

301
00:17:09,351 --> 00:17:10,760
origin used to cause.
And it was like,

302
00:17:10,761 --> 00:17:12,350
this is a completely
inappropriate reaction.

303
00:17:12,351 --> 00:17:13,910
This is an employee who works for me,

304
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:17,360
who's trying to get a scrubbed on and
all of a sudden I'm like, you know,

305
00:17:17,361 --> 00:17:20,870
reliving these historical wounds,
it's not appropriate.

306
00:17:20,871 --> 00:17:24,740
So I think it was a sort of me really
trying to put an end to that story and

307
00:17:24,741 --> 00:17:29,510
respond to present circumstances
with presence, appropriate emotions.

308
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:34,070
Got It. That makes any sense. It
does make sense. And the I love you.

309
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:38,770
I love you is um, a couple things. Uh,

310
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,310
my last special was called I love you.
Uh,

311
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:45,740
but I actually did that
after I got the tattoo. I um,

312
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:47,790
interesting.
I'm trying to like,

313
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,760
figure out how to say this
without seeming like ridiculous,

314
00:17:50,761 --> 00:17:55,710
but something that I sound ridiculous
sometimes I'm on the podcast, maybe,

315
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:58,140
you know what I mean? I'm just
admitting like pretty embarrassing.

316
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:59,880
It's pretty hard to embarrass me,
but this,

317
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:02,550
but any kind of vulnerability tends
to be a little bit embarrassing for a

318
00:18:02,551 --> 00:18:03,670
comedian.
Um,

319
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:08,670
I was struggling a little bit
with patience and compassion and,

320
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:12,510
um, again, I'm codependent or like
I grew up in an alcoholic home,

321
00:18:12,511 --> 00:18:15,500
which a lot of times people get a,

322
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:19,050
we have a lot of trouble with patients
and control and we want everyone to do

323
00:18:19,051 --> 00:18:20,790
what we want to do when
we want it to be done.

324
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,500
And that's sort of how
we survived as children,

325
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:25,500
is that if I could just organize
my drinks in the right row,

326
00:18:25,501 --> 00:18:26,700
I'm going to be fine,
you know,

327
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:31,080
and I found myself and I travel a
tremendous amount as I'm sure you do also,

328
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:35,190
or, and I have in the past
and I just found myself
getting frustrated with people

329
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:39,300
not doing things my way.
I don't know if you've ever tasted,

330
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,290
it's like every minute of
every hour of my life. Okay.

331
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:46,560
So I might have a pamphlet for you.
Yeah. Um, but I found myself just being,

332
00:18:46,561 --> 00:18:48,240
and I think that's one of
the reasons I gravitated,

333
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:52,230
gravitated towards being a writer and a
comedian is I get to do it all on my own.

334
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:56,580
Right. You know, I write the material, I
perform it. I critique it, I rewrite it.

335
00:18:56,581 --> 00:19:00,720
I tore, I do everything on my own because
when other people get involved, I just,

336
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:03,030
you know, it's an efficient, and I
don't like the way you're doing things.

337
00:19:03,031 --> 00:19:05,200
I don't like the way you're saying that.
I don't like the way you're sitting,

338
00:19:05,201 --> 00:19:06,980
like everything.
So

339
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:12,300
is really a low stress to have 600 people
constantly just working on projects

340
00:19:12,371 --> 00:19:13,020
here.

341
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,000
Exactly. Like it's, you're
wearing flip flops to work.

342
00:19:15,001 --> 00:19:18,090
I mean it was just this like just
a way to not focus on myself.

343
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:21,600
And I think ultimately sometimes
when we judge other people,

344
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:25,200
it's just a way to not look at
ourselves as a way to feel superior or

345
00:19:25,201 --> 00:19:26,760
sanctimonious or whatever. So, um,

346
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:30,600
my trauma therapist said like every time
you meet someone just in your head say

347
00:19:30,601 --> 00:19:33,810
I love you before you have a conversation
with them and that conversation's

348
00:19:33,811 --> 00:19:35,710
going to go a lot better. Cool. I like,

349
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,190
it was just an interesting
little trek for 28 days,

350
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,480
which is how long it takes to make a
neural pathway a new neuropathway. Um,

351
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,380
I would just, uh, when I
meet someone in my head,

352
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:46,890
whether it's the lady at the DMV
who's making me wait two hours,

353
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:50,370
and essentially it's just the notion
of everybody is doing the best they can

354
00:19:50,371 --> 00:19:53,660
with what they have. Yeah. Which is
really hard for a lot of us to accept

355
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:57,540
super hard. This is, I'm
enjoying this because, uh,

356
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:02,570
I've been trying to work on a lot
of these weaknesses that I have,

357
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:08,690
which fall pretty squarely right into
the inpatient Dick category and a very

358
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:12,200
perfectionist.
Yeah.

359
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:17,780
Very meticulous in sometimes a helpful
detail oriented way oftentimes.

360
00:20:18,121 --> 00:20:21,630
And I like monkish
overbearing way. Yeah. And

361
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,060
great when you're writing a book yourself,

362
00:20:24,061 --> 00:20:26,820
but when all of a sudden you're getting
a relationship or have employees,

363
00:20:26,821 --> 00:20:27,650
it doesn't work as well

364
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:30,750
or have other people involved in
the process. You become, you know,

365
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:33,970
a problem author, which is sort
of my label. Yeah. Uh, and there,

366
00:20:33,971 --> 00:20:37,250
there are pros and cons to being a problem
author. You get the cover you want,

367
00:20:37,251 --> 00:20:38,084
but then,
you know,

368
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:41,690
so and so at the publisher wants to stab
you in the face with the pencil. Right.

369
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,700
Uh, repeatedly and people still use
pencils. I'm not sure, you know,

370
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:52,060
I'm really clawing my way through a vat
of vocab decaffeinated at the moment.

371
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:54,290
But, uh, the, um,

372
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,580
two things that are very related
that really helped me were one,

373
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:03,430
always assuming that people are fighting
battles, you know, nothing about.

374
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:06,640
Like everyone's fighting some intense
battle internally that you know nothing

375
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:07,400
about. Number one, okay

376
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:11,040
thing that is a battle for them might
be super easy for you. Right. You know,

377
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:11,691
and that's,

378
00:21:11,691 --> 00:21:16,100
I think my dad said something really
who is not known for excellent advice,

379
00:21:16,101 --> 00:21:18,140
but he said something to me,
um,

380
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:22,340
once that was super helpful because
I was having a lot of trouble in

381
00:21:22,341 --> 00:21:26,230
relationships where I felt like I
wasn't getting my needs met. And uh,

382
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:29,420
he was like, you just have to
understand how strong you come off.

383
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,210
Like people don't think you need anything.
Right?

384
00:21:32,211 --> 00:21:33,620
So that's why people don't help you.

385
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,740
And it was this interesting
thing where I was like, oh,

386
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:39,260
I mean I have a lot of weaknesses
and I'm bad at a lot of things,

387
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,600
but when I'm good at something,
which maybe you can relate to,

388
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:45,260
I'm really good at it, right? Because
I've just worked really hard at it.

389
00:21:45,261 --> 00:21:48,830
So I'm really good at things that a lot
of people might not be and vice versa.

390
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,260
So it's like, I'm like, how come?
Yeah. He hasn't finished that book yet.

391
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:53,780
How could he ever, it's been two
days. Right. And it's like, okay,

392
00:21:53,781 --> 00:21:56,690
not everyone reads a book or
whatever it is, you know, being,

393
00:21:56,691 --> 00:21:58,130
having compassion for everybody,
right?

394
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:02,950
Yeah. Not something that comes
naturally to me at least. Uh,

395
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,380
and it's not that I'm a complete like
apathetic serial killer or whatever. It's,

396
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,250
uh,
but the impatience is really pronounced.

397
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:14,720
One of my favorite quotes, one of my
favorite people is Katherine Hepburn.

398
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:18,470
And in a Philadelphia story, I think
it was Cary grant said, you, uh,

399
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:21,830
to Katharine Hepburn's character,
you have no tolerance for human weakness.

400
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:24,620
And I remember that
resonating a little bit.

401
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:28,010
Yeah. Which is, it's,

402
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:32,150
it's easy to rationalize lease. I find
ways to rationalize why it's acceptable,

403
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:37,280
but you just leave this sort of
string of collateral damage. And, uh,

404
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:42,380
the, uh, the, the two things that
that brought to mind for me were one,

405
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,140
I remember somebody told me,
you know,

406
00:22:44,141 --> 00:22:48,230
if you walk outside and you go about
your day and you meet an asshole,

407
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,220
that person's an asshole.

408
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:53,380
If you walk outside and everyone
you meet is an asshole. I love that.

409
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:57,830
I love that. And so whenever I have
one of those days where I'm like, man,

410
00:22:57,831 --> 00:23:00,580
everybody's so ungrateful and
since they're such assholes,

411
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,350
well,
wait a second now wait a second.

412
00:23:02,351 --> 00:23:06,340
I'm the common denominator in all
these interactions more my problem.

413
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:11,260
That was exactly. So that was my way
of, uh, just, it's a shortcut and it's,

414
00:23:11,261 --> 00:23:14,860
it's, as soon as I meet someone
in my hat, I just say, I love you.

415
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:19,690
And then, yeah, I love you. Can I please
get a diet coke with it? Whatever.

416
00:23:19,691 --> 00:23:23,710
I mean forever everybody and a Tsa,
can you please draw my computer?

417
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:29,520
I'm getting felt up by the TSA
guy. Um, you too. And, well,

418
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,670
I'm Tsa pre now,

419
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:37,010
that's like third base and I get
it filled up with my shoes on. Um,

420
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,590
and another thing that was super
helpful because at least in my field,

421
00:23:41,591 --> 00:23:43,510
I don't know the case for years,
I can't speak to it,

422
00:23:43,511 --> 00:23:47,030
but a lot of people who
are in a performance based
field, whether it's writing,

423
00:23:47,031 --> 00:23:50,870
acting, um, as, this is
a huge generalization,

424
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:56,170
but you can sometimes assume they didn't
get a ton of attention as a child or

425
00:23:56,931 --> 00:23:59,270
need more attention than most.
They have a compulsion to be,

426
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:02,540
need to be seen and heard and appreciated.

427
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:07,040
And humor is usually developed as
a shield slash defense mechanisms.

428
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:09,050
So what were they defending against?
We don't know,

429
00:24:09,051 --> 00:24:12,430
but it was something everyone had a thing
they had to defense defend against us

430
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:17,270
child. My last name is Cummings. That was
probably what I was managing as a child.

431
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:20,330
Um, and uh, whatever was
going on in my household.

432
00:24:20,331 --> 00:24:25,250
So you get a bunch of really fragile
people who have all these defense

433
00:24:25,251 --> 00:24:29,840
mechanisms in one room to constantly
show up everyday to be rejected because

434
00:24:29,841 --> 00:24:32,480
you're in a writer's room. All you're
doing is pitching and the boss is saying,

435
00:24:32,481 --> 00:24:36,650
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
And you're just hearing no all
day. You're not good enough.

436
00:24:36,651 --> 00:24:38,990
You're not funny enough.
Which is what we all translate to.

437
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:43,280
So much of really fragile,
sensitive people in one room and uh,

438
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:46,610
who may or may not have done the kind
of recovery that I've committed to our

439
00:24:46,611 --> 00:24:49,550
therapy. We all always just knew everyone
works as hard on ourselves as we do.

440
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,810
They know,
you know.

441
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,670
Well that,
that brings up a couple of things for me.

442
00:24:53,671 --> 00:24:58,671
One is I have at points tried
to chill the fuck out and a,

443
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,350
that takes many forms. Uh,
meditation has been very helpful.

444
00:25:04,351 --> 00:25:08,370
I do have a simple sort of daily morning
meditation practice after two of my

445
00:25:08,371 --> 00:25:13,260
friends were just like, you're being an
idiot. Maybe you should try sitting still.

446
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,400
Uh,
just

447
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:20,520
I find sitting still and focus,
returning my attention to something,

448
00:25:20,521 --> 00:25:25,140
whether that's breath or a sound or a
word for 20 minutes a day allows me not to

449
00:25:25,141 --> 00:25:26,400
feel overwhelmed.
Yup.

450
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:32,280
That is due to over responding to things
imaginary or outside of my control.

451
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:37,350
But what I wonder is for you,
I've sometimes thought, you
know what, I'm impatient,

452
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,260
but I don't want to totally fix it.
I want to dial it back,

453
00:25:40,261 --> 00:25:43,050
but I don't want to totally fix it because
there are a lot of benefits that come

454
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:45,000
from being impatient.

455
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:50,520
Sometimes it's a strength in moderation
or sometimes in extremes. I mean,

456
00:25:50,521 --> 00:25:54,540
in the end we could, we could
dig into that. But do you,

457
00:25:55,230 --> 00:26:00,230
do you worry or have you experienced
that doing the work that you've done a,

458
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:05,340
has negatively impacted your comedy in
any way doing the work I've done has it,

459
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:09,120
oh, the work I've done,
I see you're removing,

460
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:12,990
removing the shield or reducing
that codependency. Right.

461
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:15,330
Has it removed some of the magic?

462
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:20,150
Great question. Um, I think
the short answer is no.

463
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:21,080
Uh,

464
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:25,940
one of my biggest fears when I went
into a recovery program and intensive

465
00:26:25,941 --> 00:26:28,910
therapy,
like not talk therapy like trauma therapy,

466
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:32,360
which is actually kind of the opposite
of talk therapy because talk therapy

467
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:36,640
largely I'm not disapproving of
therapy, but for me personally, um,

468
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:38,420
mine has more of a
neurological perspective,

469
00:26:38,421 --> 00:26:40,730
which is when you have some kind
of trauma and you talk about it,

470
00:26:40,731 --> 00:26:43,610
you just reinvest the trauma and it
actually makes it worse. Right. Um,

471
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:47,130
so I do like, I can't talk about
a certain topic for 28 days.

472
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:50,340
I have to replace a negative thought with
a positive thought for 28 days. I mean,

473
00:26:50,341 --> 00:26:54,300
it's like a pretty hard work. I get
really worried. I was like, you know,

474
00:26:54,301 --> 00:26:58,380
talking to my therapist and a bunch
of people in my program, I was like,

475
00:26:58,381 --> 00:27:02,610
I'm just really afraid that I'm not going
to be as funny if I'm not as dark and

476
00:27:02,611 --> 00:27:03,600
in pain all the time.

477
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:08,160
And it was actually the opposite because
I wasted so much time trying to manage,

478
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,730
you know, unhealthy
relationships and the, you know,

479
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:15,810
having low self esteem and
my perfectionism, which
can be really paralyzing,

480
00:27:15,811 --> 00:27:18,360
you know, perfect perfectionism
leads to procrastination,

481
00:27:18,361 --> 00:27:19,410
which leads to paralysis.

482
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:23,040
So I could go a couple of days or like
getting any writing done because my self

483
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:23,671
esteem was too low.

484
00:27:23,671 --> 00:27:27,570
I didn't think I was good enough and
just these old sort of obsolete messages

485
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,630
and a survival instincts.
And um,

486
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:35,250
I think that it has given me so much
more mental energy, physical energy. Um,

487
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:39,450
I have much more balance in my life now
and I'm much more productive and much

488
00:27:39,451 --> 00:27:42,540
more vulnerable, which as a
writer you have to be vulnerable.

489
00:27:42,541 --> 00:27:46,680
I think before I was so overworked,
I was such a chronic workaholic

490
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:53,130
that I didn't have a life.
And in order for art imitate life,

491
00:27:53,131 --> 00:27:56,640
you have to have a life.
I saw a really profound statement.

492
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:59,940
For me art was imitating
art because I was,

493
00:27:59,941 --> 00:28:04,860
all I was doing was working turns into
this weird like recursive self reflexive.

494
00:28:04,861 --> 00:28:06,540
Yeah.
And then all of a sudden I'm just in like,

495
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:09,600
it's just so Mehta and I'm sitting in
there and I remember being in the writer's

496
00:28:09,601 --> 00:28:13,530
room and the second season of a TV
show about sort of relationships and

497
00:28:13,531 --> 00:28:15,510
someone's like, oh, what if they
go to a baby shower? And I'm like,

498
00:28:15,511 --> 00:28:19,500
no one goes to baby showers. And
everyone room was like, you don't,

499
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:24,210
but most people do on a Sunday, go to a
baby shower. And I was like, oh my God,

500
00:28:24,211 --> 00:28:28,740
I was just so work.
I was so myopic and I was so,

501
00:28:28,741 --> 00:28:32,400
I hadn't had a conversation, you
know, this is going to come off bad,

502
00:28:32,401 --> 00:28:33,510
but I'm just going to be honest,

503
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:38,340
I haven't had a conversation with
someone that I didn't pay in months. Wow.

504
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:41,550
Which is scary pay not meaning
you've paid them to talk to you,

505
00:28:41,551 --> 00:28:43,860
but an employee I've been playing.
Yeah. I only talked to though.

506
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:48,820
No one else is laughing at her script.
The compliments are all

507
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,510
memorize it. But I don't hate
that idea. That's how sick I am.

508
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:58,850
Um, but yeah, I didn't, I
hadn't had like an organic,

509
00:28:58,851 --> 00:29:01,640
healthy sort of conversation with someone.

510
00:29:01,641 --> 00:29:05,510
Not that the people that I hire are
like obsequious to me and won't walk on

511
00:29:05,511 --> 00:29:10,000
eggshells around me. I have is a
good word. That is a good word. Um,

512
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:14,820
not bad, not bad. I don't use it often,
but that felt like the right context.

513
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:19,100
But what I do and comes in with aplomb and

514
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:23,600
so I felt like, um, you know, it was
really important to me to have balance.

515
00:29:23,601 --> 00:29:25,850
Like I didn't have any hobbies.
Like I had to,

516
00:29:25,851 --> 00:29:29,900
I got assigned homework from my
trauma therapist that I had to do two,

517
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:31,130
uh,

518
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:36,130
two hours a week chunks of something
that was purely fun with no work motives

519
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:41,210
purely. So I took up a equine therapy, um,

520
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:44,650
and like some other hobbies and stuff,
but it was really a struggle. I was like,

521
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,920
I can do that. And I mean, I
get hour in, I was restless.

522
00:29:47,921 --> 00:29:51,850
I was felled on productive. I felt
like I was making notes in my phone.

523
00:29:51,851 --> 00:29:55,420
I'm like working. I
realized like, Oh my God,

524
00:29:55,421 --> 00:29:58,780
I'm doing bits with horses. What's the
deal or I mean, I was like, it was,

525
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:02,920
it was a struggle and I mean even like
listening to podcasts or I was always a

526
00:30:02,921 --> 00:30:06,130
motive of like, oh, I can get a joke out
of this or if I listen to it, you know?

527
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:10,270
And it was,
it made me realize how a work driven I was

528
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:15,730
the, so going from burning the
candle at both ends, workaholic,

529
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:21,550
what was the kind of defining moment
where you're like, no more like,

530
00:30:21,551 --> 00:30:25,570
I can't continue this way. What was the
conversation or the day or the experience

531
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:28,720
by the way in the workaholism and
you know more about this than anyone.

532
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,660
A lot of it was buisiness.
It wasn't actual work.

533
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:35,830
I was taking on a lot of tasks that I
had no business doing just because I had

534
00:30:35,831 --> 00:30:36,970
been so sort of,
um,

535
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:40,780
I think one of the most important things
you can do as an artist or in any field,

536
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:43,960
I can really only speak to Comedians,
actors, writers, performers,

537
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:47,460
is to get a handle on your issues.
Like both.

538
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:51,340
You will never be successful if you're
dysfunctional and your relationships and

539
00:30:51,341 --> 00:30:53,800
with your employees and stuff,
if you have trust issues,

540
00:30:53,801 --> 00:30:57,940
if you have abandonment issues, if you're
a narcissist, whatever it is, you know,

541
00:30:57,970 --> 00:31:01,690
um, if you are controlling, because
I found like I remember when I was,

542
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:05,860
I was so apologetic and I was so
afraid to ask for help that I was doing

543
00:31:05,861 --> 00:31:09,720
everybody's job right, which ends up
disenfranchising them. They get pissed,

544
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:12,670
they feel micromanaged and
they feel micromanaged.

545
00:31:12,671 --> 00:31:15,780
They feel you can't ultimately
pick up all that slag. Yes.

546
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,290
And I'm exhausting myself and making
them feel bad. No, everybody loses.

547
00:31:20,291 --> 00:31:23,200
And I remember I was like punching
holes in his script and there was like

548
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:28,430
literally 40 other people in that
room who wanted to do it. I mean,

549
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,200
I just had a bunch of employees that
were like, can we please do something?

550
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:34,060
Was so bored. And I was like,
I got it. I got it. I was just,

551
00:31:34,061 --> 00:31:36,250
so coming from standup comedy,

552
00:31:36,251 --> 00:31:39,520
I'm so used to doing everything
myself that asking for help,

553
00:31:39,521 --> 00:31:41,080
I realized how hard it was for me.

554
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:45,040
So there's no point in having a great
script or being a great writer actor if

555
00:31:45,041 --> 00:31:49,420
you can't let people help
you. Um, so I think a lot of,

556
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:53,440
I realized because again,
being like you and I, um,

557
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:56,350
just in terms of your, you
know, in patients and all that,

558
00:31:56,351 --> 00:31:59,380
like it works really well
up into a certain point.

559
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:03,130
So all of these defects had worked
really well for me until I had a staff,

560
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:07,330
until I had people who were I had to
collaborate with and all of a sudden I'm

561
00:32:07,331 --> 00:32:11,620
like, um, was sort of a codependent mass.
What's wrong with you people? Oh wait,

562
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:15,160
I know, why does it if you were all
just psychic and did everything my way,

563
00:32:15,161 --> 00:32:17,050
everything would be fine.
Um,

564
00:32:17,051 --> 00:32:20,620
and so I think that when I realized
that I couldn't fire someone, like,

565
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:24,430
I mean I literally would get a pit in my
stomach when I had to tell someone that

566
00:32:24,431 --> 00:32:27,700
I, you know, didn't like the script
or didn't like their joke, I realized,

567
00:32:27,701 --> 00:32:28,001
I was like,

568
00:32:28,001 --> 00:32:31,720
I can't believe how hard it is for me to
feel like I'm disappointing someone or

569
00:32:31,721 --> 00:32:33,160
just to tell the truth.
Quite frankly,

570
00:32:33,161 --> 00:32:37,420
I had so I was so apologetic and
afraid of people not liking me. Sure.

571
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:38,210
That a,

572
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:42,980
it was really paralyzing and really a
unproductive and slow down the writing

573
00:32:42,981 --> 00:32:47,570
process, uh, confused employees. I
remember in the room like, you know,

574
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:49,270
people would pitch jokes
and I would just say yes,

575
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:51,890
all of them because I didn't want to
hurt anyone's feelings and then I have to

576
00:32:51,891 --> 00:32:53,900
go later and change it and
then all of a sudden the,

577
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:56,750
the script comes out and they're jokes
aren't there and they feel betrayed and

578
00:32:56,751 --> 00:33:01,540
lied to. And you know, a, a phrase that
I love that when I first went to on,

579
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:05,330
I heard someone set up people
pleasing is a form of assholery,

580
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:09,470
which I just loved. Yeah. Because
you're not pleasing anybody.

581
00:33:09,471 --> 00:33:12,680
You're just making them resentful because
you're being disingenuous and you're

582
00:33:12,681 --> 00:33:16,190
also not giving them the dignity of their
own experience and assuming they can't

583
00:33:16,191 --> 00:33:20,930
handle the truth.
It's so patronizing.

584
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:25,380
Yeah. It's a, it's a bandaid that hurts
a lot when it gets ripped off. Yeah.

585
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:30,300
And it just, there's a very short
book called lying by Sam Harris,

586
00:33:30,301 --> 00:33:33,090
who's a phd in neuroscience,
has been on the podcast,

587
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,600
which digs into a lot of this
in a very interesting way.

588
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,580
Telec 30 leads a day or something.

589
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:43,560
Oh, I'm sure it's a three, 338.

590
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:44,870
Who does think it depends on the,

591
00:33:44,871 --> 00:33:49,000
it depends on the person
or which politician you're
listening to you. But the, uh,

592
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:53,270
the point being like when you tell
white lies or you omit certain things,

593
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:57,850
they can ultimately have the same negative
impact as an outright kind of bold

594
00:33:57,851 --> 00:34:01,930
faced lie to someone. Uh, so I,

595
00:34:01,931 --> 00:34:02,960
I apologize for interrupting.

596
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,300
No, no, that's super,

597
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:09,490
I love that. The, I want to come
back to one thing you mentioned,

598
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:12,490
which is, uh, actually before I do that,

599
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:16,900
so was there a particular breaking
point where like I need to address this?

600
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:21,270
Yes. And again, I wish I had,
I wish I lied more actually.

601
00:34:21,271 --> 00:34:25,140
I probably should lie.
And then your response to his question,

602
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,333
I um,

603
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:32,300
got pneumonia and I didn't notice
and it got really bad and uh,

604
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:36,750
turned into something called Costco.
Chondritis sounds bad,

605
00:34:36,751 --> 00:34:41,640
which is does that you get it at Costco?
The good news.

606
00:34:41,641 --> 00:34:44,570
It's really affordable and it's um,

607
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:49,420
basically the infection
from the pneumonia gets, uh,

608
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,650
in the muscles of your chest,
which is called pleurisy,

609
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:55,290
which people got like in like the civil
war. I mean it's like nobody gets this,

610
00:34:55,291 --> 00:34:59,620
like you have to go so long without
polio.

611
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:04,050
It's like and a, and then it gets inflamed
the cartilage under your rib cage.

612
00:35:04,051 --> 00:35:05,190
So it starts to just sort of,

613
00:35:05,191 --> 00:35:09,150
your chest is really sore and essentially
I just wasn't taking care of myself

614
00:35:09,151 --> 00:35:13,640
because I was so busy. I
mean, I was sleeping like
four hours a night and was in,

615
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,380
had to be in every meeting and every
editing session. And when I rewriting,

616
00:35:16,381 --> 00:35:19,560
I was writing for scripts at a time
and I was just super over extended.

617
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,210
I had some family things happen.

618
00:35:21,211 --> 00:35:25,740
My mom had a stroke at a family member
going to rehab and I just had no concept

619
00:35:25,741 --> 00:35:29,220
of boundaries and you can't
give what you don't have.

620
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:33,540
I was the queen of giving everything
away. All my energy, all my time,

621
00:35:33,541 --> 00:35:36,960
all my money, all my, you know, I was
like, I would cook a five course meal for,

622
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:40,620
but then I wouldn't eat dinner, you
know. Um, so I think, uh, you know,

623
00:35:40,621 --> 00:35:44,790
I had this doctor say to me,
you know, he's like, you're
killing yourself. You know,

624
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:49,260
like you really like need to figure
out a way to be healthier because,

625
00:35:49,261 --> 00:35:53,610
and that's when I kind of learned about
neurology and stress and cortisol and

626
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:58,020
adrenaline and F and F run
and, and how damaging they
can be on your body. And, um,

627
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:01,560
you know, I was like, I'm 27 and I
have three jobs. This is awesome,

628
00:36:01,561 --> 00:36:05,490
but then it's all fun and games
until you know, until yeah,

629
00:36:05,491 --> 00:36:10,200
you have leprosy till
your lungs. Yeah, exactly.

630
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:13,730
I just remember being like,
and I,

631
00:36:13,731 --> 00:36:17,840
I think that to that point I
remember being at the doctor and,

632
00:36:17,841 --> 00:36:19,590
and having this realization
because you know,

633
00:36:19,591 --> 00:36:24,591
I grew up on Rosanne and mad about you
and three's company and like these like

634
00:36:24,781 --> 00:36:27,450
multi cams and I love comedy. I
love Comedians, timer and be like,

635
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:32,451
I'm living my dream at 27
I have everything I wanted
for my whole life and I'm

636
00:36:32,701 --> 00:36:36,840
not enjoying it. I'm at the doctor and
I have pneumonia and I'm like, you know,

637
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:39,870
managing people's Egos instead
of just like having a great time.

638
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:44,720
What's allowed you or what are the things,

639
00:36:44,721 --> 00:36:48,770
and this comes back to something
you said about being very,

640
00:36:48,771 --> 00:36:51,650
very good at some things and
very, very, very bad at others.

641
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:57,710
And I'd be curious to know what you
think the factors or beliefs or behaviors

642
00:36:57,711 --> 00:37:01,730
were that allowed you to get
to that point at 27 I mean,

643
00:37:01,731 --> 00:37:04,130
a lot of people will say, Holy
Shit, that's really young.

644
00:37:04,131 --> 00:37:09,131
How would you get to that point from a
success standpoint and professionally?

645
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,290
Right? What were the things
that that contributed?

646
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:14,030
It got me to success.

647
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:19,100
I failed so many times and um,
wasn't deterred by it.

648
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,020
I for whatever reason,

649
00:37:21,021 --> 00:37:25,460
saw failure as practice instead
of as the end the finish line,

650
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:28,850
you know,
if that makes any sense.

651
00:37:28,851 --> 00:37:33,851
Like I wrote three pilots before
anyone even read a pilot I had written,

652
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:36,330
I um,

653
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,390
now pilot for those people who
are not sort of in the business.

654
00:37:39,391 --> 00:37:42,180
That's is that a single episode on Spec,

655
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:46,230
single episode of like basically
the first episode of a TV show,

656
00:37:46,231 --> 00:37:48,930
which is sort of has to introduce all
the characters and it's just a little

657
00:37:48,931 --> 00:37:50,460
different than a traditional episode.

658
00:37:50,461 --> 00:37:54,000
And I'm asked to be introduced
the world and be very specific.

659
00:37:54,001 --> 00:37:56,840
So I wrote one about,
um,

660
00:37:57,390 --> 00:38:02,390
the news in 2040 and it was like about
a new station and the news in 2040.

661
00:38:04,311 --> 00:38:08,280
And it was kind of this apocalyptic take
on what the news was going to be like.

662
00:38:08,281 --> 00:38:12,980
And the screen was like all covered an
ads and all of the news casters would

663
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:17,010
dress like NASCAR drivers with like
brands all over them. And you know,

664
00:38:17,011 --> 00:38:21,240
they literally, every other sentence they
said, you know, they'd be like, you know,

665
00:38:21,241 --> 00:38:25,140
so Costcos, you know,
Cincinnati is 72 degrees.

666
00:38:25,141 --> 00:38:29,070
Like every state was sponsored by an ad.
It was just kind of a ridiculous, um,

667
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:33,510
sort of hyperbolic sort of, um,
thing and sort of about, you know,

668
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:37,720
there's a drought and there's no
water and it was like 180 degrees out,

669
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:42,990
which may end up not being far from the
tree. It might just be a documentary. Um,

670
00:38:42,991 --> 00:38:47,260
so I, I, and everyone thought that was
kind of insane and no one really read it.

671
00:38:47,261 --> 00:38:51,550
And then I wrote one that was,
uh, based on this book called, um,

672
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:57,040
uh, uh, it was about, uh, something
about, it was like a psychology book,

673
00:38:57,041 --> 00:38:59,920
I think it was called, uh,
the, uh, I don't remember,

674
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:03,580
but it was about the 14 different
kinds of personalities, you know,

675
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:08,500
and uh, and I wrote about three
sisters that had the same mother,

676
00:39:08,501 --> 00:39:09,670
but three different fathers.

677
00:39:09,671 --> 00:39:13,420
And how those three different personality
types produce different sort of girls

678
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:16,180
and their relationship.
Foxton picked that up.

679
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:20,190
I wrote a pilot for comedy central,
uh,

680
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:23,200
which I still today till today I think
is the best thing I've ever written.

681
00:39:23,201 --> 00:39:27,580
It was about, was based on
me and about, uh, just me,

682
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:28,953
uh,

683
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:33,850
falling in love with a guy who was in AA
and he can't date anyone outside of Aa.

684
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:38,850
So I pretend to be an alcoholic to get
in his life and I go to Aa and pretend

685
00:39:40,421 --> 00:39:45,421
I'm getting sober to like get in his
life and then I fake a relapse and to get

686
00:39:46,241 --> 00:39:49,570
his attention and the pilot and then have
to like drink and that actually become

687
00:39:49,571 --> 00:39:54,040
an alcoholic. It's this really
ridiculous premise. And uh,

688
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:55,420
and they didn't pick that up,

689
00:39:55,421 --> 00:39:59,100
but that's what Michael Patrick King
read that made him interested in me to

690
00:39:59,101 --> 00:40:01,570
write two girls with him.
So everything that I,

691
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:04,270
and then I wrote a Spec for
a pilot that didn't even go,

692
00:40:04,271 --> 00:40:08,800
that was Dane Cook's pilot or something.
So I was just constantly,

693
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:12,460
you know, IC. Yeah, IC comedy
and writing like med school.

694
00:40:12,461 --> 00:40:15,370
It's like this is the only profession
where people think they should be famous

695
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:17,020
and be making millions
of dollars two years in.

696
00:40:17,021 --> 00:40:20,130
It's like doctors go to med school
for 10 years, 12 years. Like, yeah,

697
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:21,460
it's not that different.

698
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,200
That's really interesting.
I had to Adam Gazzaley,

699
00:40:24,201 --> 00:40:27,590
he's a neuroscientist at Ucla
on the podcast and he was like,

700
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:31,430
I was in school for 18
years. Yeah. Wow. Yeah.

701
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,850
Again, I've, comedians come up to me now
because with youtube and how fat famous,

702
00:40:35,851 --> 00:40:38,640
everyone gets so fast or some visibility,
which I think is great.

703
00:40:38,641 --> 00:40:41,790
They don't democratization
of comedy and entertainment,

704
00:40:41,791 --> 00:40:43,830
but people like three years in,
or like I just,

705
00:40:43,831 --> 00:40:45,750
I'm working on a Sitcom and I
don't have an agent. And I'm like,

706
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:51,450
you should in six years
we'll talk. Right. Get good.

707
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:54,090
And then we'll talk.
There's this entitlement now have,

708
00:40:54,091 --> 00:40:58,830
I have 10 minutes of jokes and like,
where's my sitcom? Right. You know,

709
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:01,170
it's like, it's like a doctor going
to school for two years and be like,

710
00:41:01,171 --> 00:41:04,500
I think I'm ready to operate. It's
like, no, Kelsey, in 10 years.

711
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:07,340
Yeah. Well there's a,
there's an expression in, um,

712
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:11,600
I think I'm getting this
right in Japanese, just
like he has the Samei Assay,

713
00:41:11,601 --> 00:41:15,750
which is like gets hot ease that which
gets hot easily gets cold easily.

714
00:41:15,751 --> 00:41:16,980
But I mean it's,
it's,

715
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:22,700
it's usually referred to people who find
a passion that they're really excited

716
00:41:24,091 --> 00:41:27,750
about and they go all in and then
quickly drop it, which is kind of,

717
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:32,670
I guess my entire business
model, but the, the, uh, the,

718
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:37,750
I think that can be applied to so many
different industries and skillsets and

719
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,391
just a,
for instance,

720
00:41:38,391 --> 00:41:41,720
I get asked all the time because I've
written a handful of books that have,

721
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:46,190
that have, uh, done decently well.
Uh, how do I hit the bestseller list?

722
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:49,580
And my point is,
you can game hitting the best seller list.

723
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,910
You cannot game staying on the
bestseller list and the ladder should,

724
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:55,250
the ladder should be your
focus. And they're like, well,

725
00:41:55,251 --> 00:41:56,720
how should I market my book?
And I'm like,

726
00:41:56,721 --> 00:42:01,721
it starts with writing a good book
because that is how you sort of perpetuate

727
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:08,060
and, uh, the popularity and get the word
of mouth. And I think it's, it's, I mean,

728
00:42:08,061 --> 00:42:09,440
that's a sort of a content

729
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,780
one is to make the best seller list.
And I'm really care it wasn't that good.

730
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:15,450
Yeah. You know, cause that's
like the hypes and syndrome.

731
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:18,100
Yeah. And then it drops
off. And I think that, um,

732
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:20,010
if you haven't built that foundation,

733
00:42:20,011 --> 00:42:22,890
it's very hard to have
any sustained success,

734
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,900
which is why certain
people like Justin Bieber,

735
00:42:24,901 --> 00:42:28,770
very impressive that he came out
of that sort of a youtube. Yeah.

736
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,140
Farming's you know,

737
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:34,380
scouts scouting area and has been able
to sustain it as long as he has. I mean,

738
00:42:34,381 --> 00:42:38,010
granted, I'm sure he's dealt with
his own, his own stuff, but, uh,

739
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:41,850
no one should be famous at 20. Can you
imagine if you were famous to 20? No.

740
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:44,130
The things you did when you were,
and by the way, my judgment,

741
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:47,910
my judgment was bad enough when you
were 20 with $50 million. Well, right.

742
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:51,680
It'll like take every bad decision
in pour gasoline on it had been,

743
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:56,470
had $50 million at 20. So many people
would be dead. The horrible things.

744
00:42:56,471 --> 00:43:01,320
What about that? Uh, when
you do your best writing,

745
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:02,370
uh,

746
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:07,260
whether that's the pilot
that you mentioned that
involves AA or anything else,

747
00:43:07,261 --> 00:43:09,800
when you do your best writing,
uh,

748
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:14,640
what does the process look like when you
look back at like the best stuff you've

749
00:43:14,641 --> 00:43:19,440
done? Okay. What contributed
to that writing? It's awful.

750
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:23,370
It's awful. It's awful. Writing is
awful. Yeah, I agree with that. Yeah.

751
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:28,120
It's not sexy. It's not
glamorous. It's not easy.

752
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:33,220
It's, the more I've done it, the
harder it's gotten. Uh, you know,

753
00:43:33,221 --> 00:43:36,340
because you don't want to become a parody
of yourself. You don't want to keep,

754
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:39,310
you know,
doing the same things.

755
00:43:39,311 --> 00:43:43,690
You get sort of disgusted by
your own instincts. You know,

756
00:43:43,691 --> 00:43:47,410
I've written that joke, I've written that
character or like, and then, you know,

757
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:50,770
it's gotten a little bit better cause
my inner monologue is a little bit nicer

758
00:43:50,771 --> 00:43:53,020
to me these days. You
know, I worked on that.

759
00:43:53,021 --> 00:43:57,820
I've worked on detaching from my negative,
uh, beating myself up. But writing is,

760
00:43:57,821 --> 00:44:02,110
um, writings nasty, you
know, and you know, I've,

761
00:44:02,111 --> 00:44:05,500
I've also gotten better as I've learned
about neurology in terms of like not

762
00:44:05,501 --> 00:44:09,310
trying to multitask, not, you know, I,
my internet is cut off when I write.

763
00:44:09,311 --> 00:44:11,650
I don't have my phone near me.
Um,

764
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,870
I don't try to edit and
write simultaneously.

765
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:19,790
You do sort of brainstorming or first
drafts on a computer or by hand?

766
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:25,010
I am really, um, very, uh, meticulous.

767
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,380
I'm, which I think a lot
of people have shame about.

768
00:44:27,381 --> 00:44:30,740
A lot of people wanna be like, no, I
just like, I don't, I'm not like a,

769
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:36,180
I don't wing it. I write things out.
I'm very dorky. It's note cards. It's,

770
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:40,110
you know, 30 pages of a word
document of just all my thoughts.

771
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:45,120
And then I put my dialogue into at the
entire script goes into a word document

772
00:44:45,121 --> 00:44:46,650
before I even open final draft.

773
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:50,730
So I'm pretty much done with it in a
word document with the dialogue because I

774
00:44:50,731 --> 00:44:54,060
don't like to write in final draft because
it's just harder to go back and edit.

775
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:54,750
Okay.
Got It.

776
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:57,780
And because writing and editing or two
separate parts of the brain going back

777
00:44:57,781 --> 00:45:00,420
and forth is just kind of paralyzes me.

778
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:04,720
[inaudible] I'm very easy to,
it's very easy for me to collapse.

779
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:06,970
So really I just,
I think the,

780
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:10,020
the most important thing is just
knowing your strengths and weaknesses.

781
00:45:10,021 --> 00:45:14,420
So I know that it's hard for me to
stay focused if I'm looking at a, uh,

782
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:18,300
uh, um, a final draft document and
seeing the names of the characters.

783
00:45:18,301 --> 00:45:21,600
I feel like all my God, I'm
screwing this up. This sucks inputs.

784
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:26,070
I like it to suck in word. So
the aesthetic of it is, oh,

785
00:45:26,071 --> 00:45:28,810
this is just a rough thing.
It doesn't have to be good.
Yeah. Right, right, right,

786
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:33,120
right. It's a final draft.
I'm like, that's interesting.
The aesthetic. I'm like, oh,

787
00:45:33,121 --> 00:45:36,180
did you feel like it should be better to,
exactly.

788
00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:38,820
When I see the form of final draft,
it's like, oh my God, I suck. I said,

789
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:40,720
what am I doing in here? Right. So I've,

790
00:45:40,721 --> 00:45:45,040
I've learned how to sort of like
quell my own fears and anxieties. Um,

791
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:49,140
it's a lot of pacing. It's a lot of
eating. It's a lot of going on walks.

792
00:45:49,141 --> 00:45:54,030
It's a lot of, do you have a
set time or did you like when,

793
00:45:54,031 --> 00:45:54,864
during these periods where you,

794
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:57,930
where you felt like you put out really
good work and that could be now obviously,

795
00:45:57,931 --> 00:46:00,750
but, uh, morning, night,

796
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:04,860
middle of the night coffee one, like
what's the cocktail? The whole thing.

797
00:46:04,861 --> 00:46:07,270
I do not drink pretty much.
Um,

798
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:11,200
when I'm writing I try not to
drink at all because I think, um,

799
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:15,390
since I've started eating so healthy,
my body just metabolizes out. I mean,

800
00:46:15,391 --> 00:46:16,710
I used to,
I'm 32 now.

801
00:46:16,711 --> 00:46:21,150
Something happened to me when I turned
30 where I just could not drink the way I

802
00:46:21,151 --> 00:46:23,910
used to.
I on my 30th birthday,

803
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:28,620
someone sent me two shots of Tequila and
I'm pretty competitive, so he's like,

804
00:46:28,621 --> 00:46:30,950
I bet you can't drink those faster
than me. And I was like, boom.

805
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:34,310
Okay.
So like the oldest trick in the book?

806
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:40,400
I did not. No, it's not that I
do that, but it's like, you know,

807
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:42,440
I, I can recognize it.
I'm like, Oh my God,

808
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:47,870
I bet you can take these two goofy's
fast timber roofing eating competition.

809
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:48,973
I just was like,

810
00:46:49,190 --> 00:46:53,510
and I was like on an empty stomach and
literally I woke up in my bed the next

811
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:54,740
morning and I had like 30 minutes

812
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:57,840
calls and texts and people were like,
did you go home with John Mayer?

813
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:01,210
And I was like, you're like, I
hope so. I know. I'm kidding.

814
00:47:02,770 --> 00:47:06,220
Did anyone get photos? I
don't even remember seeing
John Mayer. I was just like,

815
00:47:06,221 --> 00:47:09,960
okay, I, I can never drink
tequila again. Certainly. Um,

816
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:12,910
but so I'm just like honoring
the fact that okay, I just,

817
00:47:12,911 --> 00:47:15,270
I can't be as productive
and prolific when I drink,

818
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:17,630
so I don't drink when
I'm writing. I wait, wake

819
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:22,370
up. Um, I, uh, have like 30
minutes online. You know, I'd, I,

820
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:26,050
I really try to keep it to like four
basic sites. What are the, what are the,

821
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:30,310
I always do Huffington Post.
I do salon. I do slate,

822
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:35,680
one of Madison, Ashley Madison,
the Haka, Laura, Ashley,

823
00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:40,810
Ashley Madison. Um, and then one
kings lane, which is like my sort of,

824
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:42,640
you know, um, thing.

825
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:46,960
And Dig sometimes and it kind of depends
what I'm working on because it's also,

826
00:47:46,961 --> 00:47:47,950
if I'm writing right now,

827
00:47:47,951 --> 00:47:52,190
I'm writing a pilot for HBO
that's sort of about gender and,

828
00:47:52,191 --> 00:47:56,260
and it's got a lot of science in it. So
I'll go to psychology today. Jazz Bell,

829
00:47:56,290 --> 00:48:00,130
the Frisky, which are kind of um,
the Friskies, the Friskies is like a,

830
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:05,830
it's like a website for girls that's
got a lot of like studies and this many

831
00:48:05,831 --> 00:48:09,610
women admit to having orgasms and
masturbation is good for your health.

832
00:48:09,611 --> 00:48:13,420
Sort of like edgy. It's like
cosmo. Some citations. Yes.

833
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:19,420
Smart cars,
smart guy.

834
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:24,680
And uh, so if there's anything
that's relevant or you know, and uh,

835
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,130
I'll look at Twitter,
you know,

836
00:48:27,131 --> 00:48:29,730
I sort of follow all the major
news things on Twitter, but I,

837
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:31,030
once I get into that,

838
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:34,720
it activates a part of my brain that's
a little too self conscious and what's

839
00:48:34,721 --> 00:48:35,860
everybody else doing?

840
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:40,300
So I tried to not do that cause I do know
that all of this is an addiction and I

841
00:48:40,301 --> 00:48:43,480
have to sort of keep it under control.
I do coffee,

842
00:48:43,481 --> 00:48:48,280
I do vitamins. How do you do
your coffee? I do my coffee. Um,

843
00:48:48,330 --> 00:48:53,290
in a Keurig. Yeah, I do. Correct.
That's a hard one. Pure Ag. I know.

844
00:48:53,291 --> 00:48:58,150
I couldn't say d. What was it? Decent
today. It's a lot of syllables.

845
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:00,840
That's that I need to do.
I need, I'm going to do,

846
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:03,910
I did any of that one out of the park.
Um,

847
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:07,580
I do a with almond milk and this
something all natural sugar.

848
00:49:07,581 --> 00:49:10,120
I had this woman come in and take
all the carcinogens out of my house,

849
00:49:10,121 --> 00:49:14,320
so I'm like making my own almond milk,
like an Amish slave these days.

850
00:49:14,570 --> 00:49:16,660
It's really lives,
make amazing coffee.

851
00:49:19,350 --> 00:49:22,540
Um, so, but I usually tie those beards
back. That's right. That's right.

852
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:26,500
And I try not to do too much
coffee and then I do on a smoothie.

853
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:28,410
Would you heard about,
but it's,

854
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:30,220
it's like kind of like
everything I need for the day,

855
00:49:30,221 --> 00:49:32,800
so I'm not worrying later about
what I should eat for lunch.

856
00:49:32,801 --> 00:49:35,620
Have I had enough time? Are you
waking up generally? Usually about,

857
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:39,280
depending on how late I'm doing shows
right now I'm touring to get ready for my

858
00:49:39,281 --> 00:49:42,790
special.
So on the weekends when I am on the road,

859
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:45,790
I'll wake up more like 10 or 11
but when I'm writing, I try to,

860
00:49:45,791 --> 00:49:49,600
I try to wake up early and when
I was writing a script last year,

861
00:49:49,601 --> 00:49:52,870
I would wake up at like 5:00 AM and try
to work from like five to nine and go

862
00:49:52,871 --> 00:49:56,830
back to sleep. Cause isn't that when our
brain is the most kind of for awhile?

863
00:49:56,890 --> 00:50:00,710
Well yeah, it depends. I mean the of the
writers I know who are really prolific,

864
00:50:01,070 --> 00:50:05,420
uh, and put out good work,
it seems like they all,

865
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:09,020
there are a couple of exceptions and I
hate them because I can't do what they do,

866
00:50:09,021 --> 00:50:11,790
which is like, they're like, oh yeah, from
one to 2:00 PM I'll kick out an article.

867
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:15,380
No, can't do it. No. These writers,

868
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:19,010
the more common case I, they write
when other people are asleep. Yeah.

869
00:50:19,011 --> 00:50:22,370
Whether that means staying up really,
really late, which I can't do.

870
00:50:22,450 --> 00:50:25,610
Or waking up early really early yet. And
I was always the night owl version. Yeah.

871
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:29,080
But yeah, it's great to wake up at 5:00
AM cause you're not getting emails,

872
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:31,730
you're not on the mass emails
and whatever, you know.

873
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,020
So I would do that and then
go back to sleep. Got It.

874
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:40,430
Which was super helpful cause
my circadian rhythms are, um, I,

875
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:44,390
my nap game is pretty strong, I
believe. Very strongly enough.

876
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:47,470
Okay. So wait, let's, so let's
revisit that time period then. Okay.

877
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:51,310
So you wake up at five,
five, you do a four hour

878
00:50:53,070 --> 00:50:55,900
blitz, like go back to
bed. When do you wake up?

879
00:50:56,320 --> 00:51:01,030
I'll go back to bed at like noon or one.

880
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:05,470
A lot of times I'll sleep for like two
hours and then take another nap from like

881
00:51:05,471 --> 00:51:08,080
seven to eight because then
I'll go to stand up at night.

882
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:11,290
So what I usually try to do
is break my day into two days,

883
00:51:11,650 --> 00:51:15,610
like too many days because I mean,
I don't know how can be,

884
00:51:15,611 --> 00:51:17,050
I think a lot of comedians
sleep really late.

885
00:51:17,051 --> 00:51:20,440
But if I'm gonna wake up at eight and
then I have to perform at 10 right?

886
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:22,570
By the time it's 10 o'clock,
everyone else's winding down.

887
00:51:22,571 --> 00:51:25,300
And then all of a sudden I have
to be like hilarious and charming.

888
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:29,500
So I'll usually take a nap at like six
to seven so that I wake up and like I'll

889
00:51:29,501 --> 00:51:33,230
have a little bit of coffee and then
like go do stand up. Yeah, game on.

890
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:37,460
Very large, very Argentinian.
That's what they do kind of for the,

891
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:41,570
for the tango. I lived in Argentina for
nine months and the, in the tango world,

892
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:46,490
nothing really get started until 11
o'clock at night or, or midnight.

893
00:51:47,150 --> 00:51:50,500
And so people would do exactly
what you're describing. Yeah,

894
00:51:51,590 --> 00:51:55,240
the, okay. Got It. So then, uh,

895
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,890
during that four hour blitz,
you wake up,

896
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:01,070
are you still doing the 30 minutes
of Internet in the beginning?

897
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:05,500
I guess I don't, yeah, I'll do
it in the morning. Okay. To me,

898
00:52:05,501 --> 00:52:10,501
that's always my eye because I know how
many interests we all have and how many

899
00:52:11,561 --> 00:52:14,230
priorities we have. So it's, we
want to know what the news is.

900
00:52:14,410 --> 00:52:16,630
We want to put nutrients in our body,

901
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:20,530
we want to connect with our parents
or loved ones or whatever it is.

902
00:52:20,650 --> 00:52:24,040
So I'll try to get that all done as early
as possible so it's not looming over

903
00:52:24,041 --> 00:52:26,920
me all day. So it's like if I've
just checked all the news, okay,

904
00:52:26,921 --> 00:52:29,890
I know everything that I checked box,

905
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:32,470
I have my smoothie with all
my nutrients and it checkbox

906
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:37,070
can, you know, I know during the sound,
the sound check, which was spectacular,

907
00:52:37,710 --> 00:52:40,370
but I made a solemn
promise not to use that.

908
00:52:40,371 --> 00:52:42,250
So could you elaborate on this movie?

909
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:47,040
Okay. So I, um, uh, this woman, uh,

910
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:50,240
her name is Lori Cohen. Peter's,
uh, she's pretty amazing.

911
00:52:50,241 --> 00:52:53,210
And she comes to Your House and tells
you everything in your house that's

912
00:52:53,211 --> 00:52:57,380
killing you. Uh, basically your
cleaners, your food. I mean,

913
00:52:57,381 --> 00:53:01,670
I thought I was like going to this
super all natural grocery store and she

914
00:53:01,671 --> 00:53:02,391
literally,
I mean,

915
00:53:02,391 --> 00:53:06,950
I had almond milk and Hummus
and raw and a mommy. I mean,

916
00:53:06,951 --> 00:53:09,020
I think I'm nailing it right?
And literally, I'm like,

917
00:53:09,021 --> 00:53:10,820
this one's going to come over
and I'm gonna get a refund.

918
00:53:10,821 --> 00:53:14,660
She opens and she looks at me like,
like horrified. And she was like,

919
00:53:14,661 --> 00:53:17,690
you're eating this. And I
was like, almond. She's like,

920
00:53:17,691 --> 00:53:19,430
it's full of let the sin and level of law.

921
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:24,050
So cause I was also having some trouble
with 'em and my energy level and my

922
00:53:24,051 --> 00:53:29,051
liver was a little and I wasn't
converting folic acid properly.

923
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:32,480
They were just like a couple
things that were up. And uh,

924
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:37,890
so she put the smoothie together
for me that it's uh, uh,

925
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:42,890
Kale of course that shovel of the
hour cause like guys do vegetable.

926
00:53:43,270 --> 00:53:47,130
Um, I was in Savannah like two weeks
gone. Some was like, are you eating Kale?

927
00:53:47,131 --> 00:53:50,960
And I was like, Kales officially made it.
It's in Savannah. People know about Kale.

928
00:53:50,970 --> 00:53:55,020
It's fish, it's, it's officially in
the Zike guys. It's Kale, carrots,

929
00:53:55,021 --> 00:53:59,220
Kiwi raspberries, avocado, olive oil,

930
00:53:59,221 --> 00:54:02,580
flax oil,
some kind of green powder.

931
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:05,820
And then we put all my
sort of pills in there,

932
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:12,740
which is like a adrenal
support cod liver oil.

933
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:18,340
Yes. That's good. Uh, no
mercury, vitaminK , uh,

934
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:22,950
Alpha lipoic acid. Okay, thank you. Um,

935
00:54:22,990 --> 00:54:27,590
desensitization, uh, uh, think,

936
00:54:27,690 --> 00:54:28,590
oh co Q 10,

937
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:34,460
and I think that is maybe
that's playing 2% of the pelvis.

938
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:40,350
And then we actually make the shit.
And then we add the ingredient, right.

939
00:54:40,351 --> 00:54:41,184
That's step one.

940
00:54:41,610 --> 00:54:44,760
Uh, got it. And um,

941
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:49,270
okay. That all the old
released of like, okay,

942
00:54:49,330 --> 00:54:52,300
I can kind of eat whatever I want all
day and I've gotten everything I needed

943
00:54:52,301 --> 00:54:55,030
cause I could be, so I don't
know if this is the case for you.

944
00:54:55,270 --> 00:54:56,470
If I need somebody to be done,

945
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:58,510
I can't stop thinking about it
until it's been accomplished.

946
00:54:58,930 --> 00:55:01,690
So I just have to do it right away. I
can't be like, oh, eat a healthy dinner.

947
00:55:01,691 --> 00:55:06,010
Cause then I'll just like worry about
it. That's on it. Have it on loop. Yeah.

948
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:08,620
So I know my limitations
and I try to just,

949
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:12,930
and so, so let's take,
uh, if you think, well,

950
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:17,070
let me ask a couple of kind of rapid fire
questions just for people who want to

951
00:55:17,071 --> 00:55:20,370
get more familiar with your stuff.
So if you could recommend

952
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:26,100
that someone listen, listen, or
watch five minutes of your material,

953
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:30,480
of your stuff, five to 10, let's just
say, what would you point them to?

954
00:55:31,330 --> 00:55:34,810
I would first tell you to
put your kids away. Yeah. Um,

955
00:55:35,470 --> 00:55:40,310
I would point them to my last standup
special, uh, as you can see on my arm is,

956
00:55:40,311 --> 00:55:43,000
it's called I love you as part
of the advertising campaign.

957
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,770
Um,
and I would,

958
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:52,360
I would just do the first five
minutes of my last special. Okay.

959
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:55,570
The first or the last first five
minutes of the last five minutes. Okay.

960
00:55:56,100 --> 00:56:00,060
So if we, if we take a look
then at the first five minutes,

961
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:03,450
and I don't want to give away any secret
sauce necessarily, or the punchline,

962
00:56:03,690 --> 00:56:07,200
literally, I guess, but,
uh, if, if we look at that,

963
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:10,230
where did it start?
Like what was the,

964
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:14,220
the kind of development process
of one of the five minutes? Yeah.

965
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:17,160
Or of like one of the bits, if
that's the right word. Yeah.

966
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:20,620
I don't know in those five minutes, like
where did it, where did it come from?

967
00:56:20,621 --> 00:56:24,280
Them were, or, uh, I'd love to
just kind of track the, sure.

968
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:29,320
The growth and development of
that idea from pain. It came,

969
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:33,800
my stand up is, I'm always comes from, uh,

970
00:56:33,970 --> 00:56:38,970
sublimating or alchemizing really painful
situations and to figuring out how to

971
00:56:39,881 --> 00:56:44,260
make it funny. Okay. Uh, and so I went,
I was in a sort of really codependent,

972
00:56:44,261 --> 00:56:46,870
unhealthy relationship.
I'm going to get an embarrassing question.

973
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:48,760
What does codependent mean?
Go to Bennett.

974
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:52,060
I was actually heard it used a
lot and I'd never been 100% clear.

975
00:56:52,090 --> 00:56:55,480
That's actually a great, uh, question
because most people use it wrong.

976
00:56:55,890 --> 00:56:58,570
Most people think codependence means
spending a lot of time with people or I

977
00:56:58,571 --> 00:57:01,000
can't be alone or whatever,
which could be an element of,

978
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:04,870
but codepen dense is essentially that
you look to other people to decide how

979
00:57:04,871 --> 00:57:08,980
you're feeling. So I go up, Tim's in a
bad mood. Uh, okay, now I'm in a bad mood.

980
00:57:08,981 --> 00:57:13,270
It's like essentially you're a reactive
person and you put other people's needs

981
00:57:13,271 --> 00:57:16,510
before your own. I got it. All
right. Thank you. That, so, you know,

982
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:19,030
I have a doctor's appointment.
Tim asked me to drive him to the airport.

983
00:57:19,031 --> 00:57:21,430
I'm going to drive you to the airport
and I'm going to forego my doctor's

984
00:57:21,431 --> 00:57:23,680
appointment. Your comfort
comes first, essentially.

985
00:57:23,890 --> 00:57:26,300
And it usually codependence
breeds resentment, right?

986
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:28,090
So I'm going to do this for you.

987
00:57:28,091 --> 00:57:30,100
And then two weeks later you're five
minutes late. And I'm like, well,

988
00:57:30,101 --> 00:57:32,470
I drove you to the airport and you're
like, well, I didn't want you to,

989
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:37,450
you offered you martyr yourself,
essentially. Got It. Um, which is,

990
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:41,730
it's pretty nefarious because you're,
uh,

991
00:57:41,830 --> 00:57:46,240
masquerading as really kind of Nice. So
everyone, when I was in the height of my,

992
00:57:46,450 --> 00:57:48,320
my codependent glory days,
uh,

993
00:57:48,330 --> 00:57:52,810
I was like the next person who would help
you move and I'd pay for the bill and

994
00:57:52,811 --> 00:57:57,730
I was like the nicest person yet
people pleasing as far of assholery.

995
00:57:57,850 --> 00:58:02,470
So then I was like annoyed at everybody
for not taking better care of me and

996
00:58:02,471 --> 00:58:04,720
keeping score. And then, you know,

997
00:58:04,721 --> 00:58:07,740
it's not a truly nice thing if you're
expecting something in return, you know?

998
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:11,680
So it's just a way to victimize
yourself and a way to, I'm like,

999
00:58:11,681 --> 00:58:14,260
I don't know if you've ever dated someone
like this or had an employee like this

1000
00:58:14,261 --> 00:58:16,780
where some of that does nice things for
you and then gets mad at you for not

1001
00:58:17,050 --> 00:58:20,800
receiving the gifts the way they
wanted you to have them. Yes, yes.

1002
00:58:20,801 --> 00:58:22,470
Which is a way for your,

1003
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:26,930
like you just started this fight
and made me a jerk. Do me a favor.

1004
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:30,820
I didn't ask for it. Then the Lord it over
me. I just made you a four course meal.

1005
00:58:30,821 --> 00:58:34,300
It's like I didn't ask you to do any
of those things. Why are you, you know,

1006
00:58:34,301 --> 00:58:37,150
and then you get mad when they don't
appreciate it the way you'd want them to.

1007
00:58:37,450 --> 00:58:39,500
So codependence breeds resentment.
So,

1008
00:58:39,530 --> 00:58:43,660
but it's a tricky thing to catch and
recover from because again, your story is,

1009
00:58:43,661 --> 00:58:48,250
I'm just being nice. Um, so I was kind
of in a, in a relationship like that,

1010
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:52,420
uh, with someone that sort of
recreated my childhood circumstances.

1011
00:58:52,421 --> 00:58:57,310
So it just felt familiar
and um, uh, I, yeah,

1012
00:58:57,311 --> 00:59:01,120
so that's the answer to that,
but I can't remember the material.

1013
00:59:01,121 --> 00:59:04,300
The bitten is five minutes
from your painful experience.

1014
00:59:04,301 --> 00:59:07,960
So I had all this rage after
I got out of it. Not Rage,

1015
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:11,950
but just sort of like I was disrespected
in a relationship and I just took like,

1016
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:14,470
you know, for I, I,

1017
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:17,530
the reason I think I'm proud of that
first five minutes is because that was my

1018
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:21,250
sort of more, I think getting your
heartbroken is really important.

1019
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:26,020
If you're an artist, I encourage you
to get your heartbroken, get hurts,

1020
00:59:26,510 --> 00:59:30,710
fall on your face, make
mistakes, um, thaw the ice,

1021
00:59:30,711 --> 00:59:35,150
break through the defenses and get
vulnerable because I think that there's a

1022
00:59:35,151 --> 00:59:37,220
difference between getting your heart
heartbroken and getting your heart broken

1023
00:59:37,221 --> 00:59:40,850
open. And when it gets broken
open, you know, you can really,

1024
00:59:40,851 --> 00:59:45,410
that's where the meat is. That's where,
that's where you write great characters.

1025
00:59:45,411 --> 00:59:49,850
That's how you get vulnerable. And it's
important because I think Comedians,

1026
00:59:49,851 --> 00:59:53,120
we pride ourselves on how tough
we are. Yeah. But you know,

1027
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:56,180
we're porcupines under there.
It's all marshmallow.

1028
00:59:56,181 --> 00:59:58,430
Just get to the marshmallow
cause that's where the gold is.

1029
00:59:58,431 --> 01:00:02,150
I promise if you just tell the truth
and get your heartbroken as a comedian,

1030
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:05,960
you will have a house. That's cool. Yeah.

1031
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:10,370
So I think you may mean a
lot of professions being
tough is what's valued in

1032
01:00:10,371 --> 01:00:12,440
comedy being weak.
It's like power through Vulnera

1033
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:16,160
ability. The um, uh,

1034
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:20,460
the speech that brings to mind for me
as a commencement speech by a writer I

1035
01:00:20,461 --> 01:00:25,200
really admire named Neal gay men love
them. Yeah. Make good art. Cat exploded,

1036
01:00:25,201 --> 01:00:28,060
make good on this happened,
make good art. And uh,

1037
01:00:29,190 --> 01:00:31,860
I think I'm quoting him correctly.
This is paraphrased of course. Yeah.

1038
01:00:31,890 --> 01:00:35,430
But I think I know that knew that you
liked him because on one of your podcasts

1039
01:00:35,431 --> 01:00:36,264
you brought him up.

1040
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:39,100
Big Fan. Yeah. A little
bit of a fanboy, a yeah.

1041
01:00:39,101 --> 01:00:43,300
A bit of Ben is like understatement
of the podcast, but he, um,

1042
01:00:43,690 --> 01:00:47,920
amazing guys who have, I met him for
the first time, uh, in SF very briefly,

1043
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:49,600
and I'd heard his audio books.

1044
01:00:49,601 --> 01:00:54,601
So it was extremely surreal to hear him
sound so erudite and extremely British

1045
01:00:54,671 --> 01:00:57,820
in person. And I was like, am I
listening to an audio book right now?

1046
01:00:58,750 --> 01:01:03,100
This is amazing. And uh, but the
line was something along the lines.

1047
01:01:03,101 --> 01:01:06,790
I'm saying lines a lot of, I'm
on, I'm on the home, on the line,

1048
01:01:07,690 --> 01:01:10,110
on the line theme, but he said, uh,

1049
01:01:10,210 --> 01:01:12,910
when you start to feel
extremely uncomfortable,

1050
01:01:12,911 --> 01:01:14,470
like you're walking down the street naked,

1051
01:01:14,890 --> 01:01:18,580
then maybe you're starting to get
it right. Oh, that's so great.

1052
01:01:20,140 --> 01:01:21,850
And when I put out,

1053
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:26,890
I've experienced in my own writing where
I'll spend disgusting amount of time on

1054
01:01:26,891 --> 01:01:28,630
a given a blog posts,
let's say,

1055
01:01:28,631 --> 01:01:33,631
that I think is going to kill it and
they just flops or it was just crickets.

1056
01:01:34,210 --> 01:01:38,020
And then when I have that
extreme discomfort and, um,

1057
01:01:38,170 --> 01:01:41,590
I hesitate drafting it and
I hesitate publishing it.

1058
01:01:41,591 --> 01:01:44,320
Those are almost always the
pieces that do the best.

1059
01:01:44,321 --> 01:01:48,670
So even outside of comedy and
writing, I find that to be true. Um,

1060
01:01:49,090 --> 01:01:53,230
okay, so you have to take
this pain. Yeah. Did you,

1061
01:01:53,950 --> 01:01:58,950
did you take notes on the pain as you
were experiencing it or did you recall it

1062
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:02,650
in one of your writing
sessions and put down the bone?

1063
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:04,640
I remember actually,

1064
01:02:04,641 --> 01:02:09,120
and this might be cheating a little
bit and are not cheating, but, um,

1065
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:14,920
I actually remember sharing and an Al
Anon meeting something that was really

1066
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:18,440
hurt my feelings. And I was
like, and then he did this,

1067
01:02:18,441 --> 01:02:23,360
then he did this and people started
laughing and I was like, is this like,

1068
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:28,050
and I realized, Oh my God, this is funny
because it's happened to other people.

1069
01:02:28,650 --> 01:02:30,390
People are relating and it's resonating.

1070
01:02:30,391 --> 01:02:35,391
And when you tell the truth about your
embarrassing moments and show your shadow

1071
01:02:36,990 --> 01:02:41,370
catharsis happens, which is what
laughter is, which is people go, me too.

1072
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:44,190
You know? So it was
basically like, I was like,

1073
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:47,950
the whole premise of that first five
minutes was what does love mean?

1074
01:02:47,951 --> 01:02:50,190
Because I feel like my whole
life love has been a very,

1075
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:54,300
I think just in our culture in general,
love is a very confusing, vague,

1076
01:02:54,301 --> 01:02:57,930
manipulative word,
right? And, um, you know,

1077
01:02:57,931 --> 01:03:02,310
this is why I love working with animals
so much is that you only communicate

1078
01:03:02,311 --> 01:03:04,650
through behavior, not their words.
Because words can be so confusing.

1079
01:03:04,651 --> 01:03:07,710
Words mean something different
to everybody, you know?
And they have no bumps,

1080
01:03:07,711 --> 01:03:10,620
like can't get it. They have no, they
can't open your doors, steal your stuff.

1081
01:03:10,830 --> 01:03:13,960
That's true. That's true. They
can't read your blog and day.

1082
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:16,530
This wasn't as good as the last
one. Right. Just love them.

1083
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:20,890
They're your biggest fan.
Um, and uh, and so law of I,

1084
01:03:20,891 --> 01:03:24,420
I kept being in these difficult
relationships where it was always like,

1085
01:03:24,421 --> 01:03:26,640
but I love you but I love you.
And then it was like,

1086
01:03:26,641 --> 01:03:30,270
it would just undermine all of the bad
behavior and I feel like I was, you know,

1087
01:03:30,271 --> 01:03:32,220
the definition of insanity,
doing the same thing over and over again,

1088
01:03:32,221 --> 01:03:33,930
expecting a different
result. I was like, I keep,

1089
01:03:34,290 --> 01:03:38,250
I kept justifying being in
bad relationships because
of this vague amorphous

1090
01:03:38,251 --> 01:03:41,940
thing called love, which I was
like, so love means you hate you.

1091
01:03:41,970 --> 01:03:44,670
I love you means I hate you. Basic.
Like I just was. So I was like,

1092
01:03:44,671 --> 01:03:47,340
we need to all agree on
a universal definition.

1093
01:03:47,341 --> 01:03:49,980
I think that was my sort of
solution. I was like, we should,

1094
01:03:50,010 --> 01:03:53,910
because I see so many people getting
hurt and disappointed because their

1095
01:03:53,911 --> 01:03:55,110
definitions are different.

1096
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:58,830
And then I sort of laid out what
I think my definition of love is.

1097
01:03:58,831 --> 01:04:02,490
And it should be very simple.
I'm not going to be happy and do the bit,

1098
01:04:02,491 --> 01:04:04,560
but it was like,
I was like,

1099
01:04:04,561 --> 01:04:09,390
my definition of love is being willing
to die for someone that you yourself want

1100
01:04:09,391 --> 01:04:14,130
to kill that. In my experience,
it's kind of the deal.

1101
01:04:15,090 --> 01:04:19,890
And uh, and if you love me, don't do
these 10 things that I had been through.

1102
01:04:19,890 --> 01:04:24,740
Like if I'm in the shower with you,
don't pee. It was like stuff like that.

1103
01:04:24,741 --> 01:04:27,670
Like is that so much to ask?
Like things like that. Like,

1104
01:04:27,710 --> 01:04:30,960
and I just listed all of my
grievances and I was like,

1105
01:04:30,990 --> 01:04:33,420
it's so great to be able to, um, you know,

1106
01:04:33,421 --> 01:04:36,450
that is what is great about comedy
is every time something bad happens,

1107
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:39,020
I'm now conditioned to go like, oh,
this is gonna be a great joke. Yeah.

1108
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:43,710
So every thing that sox ends up
being a gift somehow like, um,

1109
01:04:43,740 --> 01:04:47,190
when I first had money, like I grew
up without any money and I, uh,

1110
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:50,940
got a car like seven years ago,
maybe it was,

1111
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:53,100
I got my first car that I paid for myself.

1112
01:04:53,130 --> 01:04:57,480
It was a Lexus hybrid and
the first day I got it,

1113
01:04:57,481 --> 01:04:58,920
I filled it up with diesel fuel

1114
01:05:00,660 --> 01:05:04,140
and not the right thing to do.
Just destroyed it.

1115
01:05:04,141 --> 01:05:06,900
I mean it costs like six grand
or something. It was awful.

1116
01:05:06,901 --> 01:05:11,040
And I got this great joke
out of it though. I got like
a seven minute bit that,

1117
01:05:11,250 --> 01:05:13,640
you know, probably paid for
all the damage, you know, that.

1118
01:05:13,641 --> 01:05:16,040
So now I'm in this place where when
something bad happens I'm like, Oh God,

1119
01:05:16,050 --> 01:05:19,880
I can use that good material.
Exactly. So that organic, yeah.

1120
01:05:20,150 --> 01:05:22,270
Is the upside of being a comedian.

1121
01:05:23,740 --> 01:05:25,750
And um, oh, what was I going,

1122
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:28,780
I was going to dig a little
bit further into that,

1123
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:34,870
but maybe I can take a step back.
I was looking on Wikipedia,

1124
01:05:34,871 --> 01:05:38,560
which is, we all know he was always,
always a hundred percent factual, factual,

1125
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:43,660
but it said genres, observational
comedy, blue comedy,

1126
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:48,610
insult comedy. Oh. And I wasn't sure
what blue comedy was, quite frankly.

1127
01:05:48,670 --> 01:05:51,850
The other ones seemed a little more
straightforward. What is blue comedy?

1128
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:56,540
Blue comedy? Um, I mean, I take, uh,

1129
01:05:57,010 --> 01:06:01,050
the fence to that. It's kind of,
it's not a lost thing. It's true.

1130
01:06:01,051 --> 01:06:05,210
I don't even know where it came to me
because I don't tell you blue comedies

1131
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:08,570
thought it was like dirty cop,
edgy comedy, you know, and edgy.

1132
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:13,570
Like Dan Carlin, Carlin, George
Carlin's up, a podcaster,

1133
01:06:13,590 --> 01:06:16,500
idolize. Oh, hardcore history.
George Carlin, George Carlin.

1134
01:06:16,501 --> 01:06:18,360
But it's tricky because it's like,
what is it again?

1135
01:06:18,361 --> 01:06:20,370
What is the definition of love?
What is the definition of dirty?

1136
01:06:20,371 --> 01:06:24,090
So for me it's like if you're talking
about an doing airplane jokes,

1137
01:06:24,091 --> 01:06:26,100
but using curse words,
is that dirty?

1138
01:06:26,310 --> 01:06:31,170
Or it's talking about sex
without Cursewords dirty kind
of, you know what I mean?

1139
01:06:31,171 --> 01:06:31,981
What's dirty to you?

1140
01:06:31,981 --> 01:06:36,981
And in our sort of puritanical society
where sex is still this really taboo,

1141
01:06:37,111 --> 01:06:41,400
uncomfortable saying. It's so interesting
to me cause it's like I do talk about,

1142
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:42,930
I don't talk about sex.

1143
01:06:42,930 --> 01:06:46,500
Like I just talk about my personal
experiences and my confusion.

1144
01:06:46,501 --> 01:06:49,680
Cause to me sex is about power
dynamics and it's about masculinity and

1145
01:06:49,681 --> 01:06:54,270
femininity and um, and just
so many primal things. And it,

1146
01:06:54,271 --> 01:06:57,180
it fascinates me because I think we
think we have so much more choice than we

1147
01:06:57,181 --> 01:07:00,630
actually do in a lot of stuff.
And it causes the most of us,

1148
01:07:00,631 --> 01:07:04,640
the most amount of pain of any other
thing in our lives. Yeah. I mean you know,

1149
01:07:04,650 --> 01:07:08,130
being cheated on or being in love and
getting heartbroken. I mean this is like,

1150
01:07:08,220 --> 01:07:11,850
I mean every movie plot,
every where every,

1151
01:07:11,851 --> 01:07:14,400
all the money is spent on
Valentine's is all about this.

1152
01:07:14,401 --> 01:07:17,550
So to me it's like how can
anything be more relevant?

1153
01:07:17,551 --> 01:07:19,620
So the fact that I talk about
sex and someone calls it blue,

1154
01:07:19,621 --> 01:07:23,010
I'm like this is all anybody cares about.
Why is this still taboo?

1155
01:07:23,070 --> 01:07:27,840
Why Blue Blue? Oh good question.
Like in terms of why is blue,

1156
01:07:27,841 --> 01:07:30,750
cause why was usually the
symbol more for sadness?

1157
01:07:31,050 --> 01:07:35,610
Oh yeah. Blue comedy.
That's a good, I don't know.

1158
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:40,620
I will look that up. That's an interesting
ediology goal. Ideological conundrum.

1159
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:45,930
Ediology well, sure. The,
the, the words words,

1160
01:07:46,530 --> 01:07:50,670
uh, the study of
morphological. Oh, there we go.

1161
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:55,140
Now you're pushing it. No, no. I
said obsequious let's not forget that

1162
01:07:56,510 --> 01:07:59,360
Asian studies major. So I can pull out the
linguistics word, the rules in a while.

1163
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:04,590
A morphological. I haven't probably ever
used that in the spoken language before,

1164
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:08,120
so, okay. That's blue. That's blue. Uh,

1165
01:08:10,050 --> 01:08:12,410
let's talk about insult comedies. So, uh,

1166
01:08:13,230 --> 01:08:16,100
you've done roasts before I in rows,

1167
01:08:17,030 --> 01:08:21,140
which, which roasts, what are some risks
that you've participated in Joan Rivers?

1168
01:08:21,410 --> 01:08:25,880
I did David Hasselhoff.
I did, uh, Donald Trump.

1169
01:08:26,510 --> 01:08:29,090
And now roasts are,
I mean,

1170
01:08:29,091 --> 01:08:32,750
just if those seem like treasure
troves of material. Well,

1171
01:08:32,751 --> 01:08:36,740
it's interesting because whenever
someone thinks that that is always a trap

1172
01:08:36,770 --> 01:08:40,340
because it's too obvious. Yes.
Too obvious. So Donald Trump,

1173
01:08:40,341 --> 01:08:41,390
everyone's gonna do hair jokes.

1174
01:08:41,391 --> 01:08:44,060
The first comment is going to do all the
hair joke. So by the time I go up six,

1175
01:08:44,090 --> 01:08:47,200
I have to have some other angle
that nobody's even have to think of.

1176
01:08:47,201 --> 01:08:50,780
Like the butterfly effect. Yes,
exactly. So we start with the hair,

1177
01:08:50,781 --> 01:08:54,140
but I went more for the, you
know, Russian mail order bride,

1178
01:08:54,141 --> 01:08:57,280
wife five to go to like a totally
different angle or, you know, you're

1179
01:09:00,070 --> 01:09:03,590
totally, I've got to go to this like
weird angle. And you know, John River is,

1180
01:09:03,591 --> 01:09:06,290
everyone's going to laugh at
the same thing. And, and um,

1181
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:11,450
and David Hasselhoff is actually kind
of tricky because he's just more of a

1182
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:15,980
general, he's just silly, you know,
like what, like what, you know,

1183
01:09:15,981 --> 01:09:17,360
so the angle on him was tricky to get,

1184
01:09:17,361 --> 01:09:21,110
but then there's a ton of other people on
the day as to, I did that in the early,

1185
01:09:21,111 --> 01:09:25,730
so I was a writer on the roast before I
was a performer on the roast. And, um,

1186
01:09:26,270 --> 01:09:26,541
you know,

1187
01:09:26,541 --> 01:09:29,690
I think it's tricky because I guess I
get defensive around that because maybe I

1188
01:09:29,691 --> 01:09:33,050
have some shame because I do feel
like they've gotten really mean.

1189
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:37,310
And the way that roast, uh, originated
was actually the friars club roast,

1190
01:09:37,311 --> 01:09:41,690
which is a bunch of comedians roasting
other Comedians, Friar's Club in New York.

1191
01:09:41,691 --> 01:09:45,050
And it was all comedians roasting
other comedians. It wasn't comedians.

1192
01:09:45,051 --> 01:09:49,850
Roasting comedians are very
different than normal people there.

1193
01:09:49,851 --> 01:09:54,300
Their brain chemistry is different. Their
Migdal is different there. I mean it's,

1194
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:59,720
I have a series of comedians should not
be let out in public. They're dangerous.

1195
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:02,930
They're like armed and day.
They're just not safe. I mean,

1196
01:10:02,931 --> 01:10:06,230
it took me a silver tongue.
It just fell adjusted.

1197
01:10:06,380 --> 01:10:10,490
It just took me a long time to realize
you can't talk to regular well adjusted

1198
01:10:10,491 --> 01:10:12,830
people the same way you talk to comedians.
Cause we were like, hey asshole,

1199
01:10:12,831 --> 01:10:16,190
what's up? And we just make fun of each
other. And that sort of, it's not healthy,

1200
01:10:16,191 --> 01:10:19,070
but that's sort of how we show love to
each other is that we rip each other and

1201
01:10:19,071 --> 01:10:22,280
make fun of each other. And,
uh, you know, and it's, it's,

1202
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:25,790
it's funny because actually you'll know
this is that, you know, Brian Callan,

1203
01:10:25,820 --> 01:10:28,010
which is how I know you own,
which you met him on,

1204
01:10:28,011 --> 01:10:29,360
what was it through apple Tinder,

1205
01:10:32,210 --> 01:10:36,050
we first connected. It was, it was, it
was very funny. First we met on Grindr,

1206
01:10:38,810 --> 01:10:40,610
most of his photos did
not involve his face.

1207
01:10:41,490 --> 01:10:44,030
And then we met again on Thrinder,

1208
01:10:44,570 --> 01:10:49,280
which is Tinder for threesomes.
And finally we were like,

1209
01:10:49,281 --> 01:10:52,220
you know, not that attracted to each
other, but we share a lot in common.

1210
01:10:52,340 --> 01:10:56,660
It's just books and drink some coffee,
be friends. I actually don't know.

1211
01:10:56,690 --> 01:11:00,500
I don't recall how I first met Brian. I,
yeah, this is like common issue for me.

1212
01:11:00,540 --> 01:11:05,090
Just sort of creeps into your life
in a very insidious way. Yeah.

1213
01:11:05,091 --> 01:11:08,630
He's like a bill due or like an
STD shows up. You don't know why.

1214
01:11:08,631 --> 01:11:11,510
And you just spend the rest of your
life trying to get rid of him. Um,

1215
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:17,060
so I remember him, you know, he,
and, uh, Brendan have a podcast yet,

1216
01:11:17,061 --> 01:11:18,750
which I think you've done right.

1217
01:11:19,020 --> 01:11:22,650
And I remember going on the podcast
and Collin and I, I was just,

1218
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:27,240
we were trashing each other. I
mean, it was like bad. I mean,

1219
01:11:27,270 --> 01:11:28,081
and then Brendan,

1220
01:11:28,081 --> 01:11:32,010
who's not a comedian and I'm trashing
him and I know when he's like,

1221
01:11:32,011 --> 01:11:35,490
are you guys fight it? I mean,
like it does look like a lawful,

1222
01:11:35,491 --> 01:11:38,760
and then I'm sort of treating
Brendan the same way.

1223
01:11:38,761 --> 01:11:43,590
And Brendan was like so insulted and upset
and it was just, I was like, oh my God.

1224
01:11:43,591 --> 01:11:47,660
Like, sorry. It's a completely
different language. So the roasts,

1225
01:11:47,730 --> 01:11:50,160
again initiated with Comedians,
roasting Comedians,

1226
01:11:50,161 --> 01:11:51,270
and then when it got on comedy central,

1227
01:11:51,271 --> 01:11:55,590
all of a sudden they start bringing
in like Pamela Anderson and you know,

1228
01:11:55,620 --> 01:12:00,620
just these perfectly nice people with
feelings who aren't numb to the core and

1229
01:12:01,021 --> 01:12:04,080
you aren't sociopaths. Right? And
so when you start mixing that,

1230
01:12:04,081 --> 01:12:05,040
that's when it started getting,

1231
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:08,910
you start seeing people
getting their feelings hurt
and you know, and also again,

1232
01:12:08,911 --> 01:12:11,160
Comedians,
I actually are more sensitive than anyone.

1233
01:12:11,161 --> 01:12:14,430
So when you start having people who aren't
comedians making fun of us, it's like,

1234
01:12:14,431 --> 01:12:17,790
oh no, you haven't earned the right to
call me up. You don't have your straps.

1235
01:12:18,030 --> 01:12:19,140
Jeff Ross can call me a whore,

1236
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:22,280
call me more. It's like all of a sudden
we have these boundaries. Well, that's,

1237
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:24,800
well, that's funny you mentioned
that because it's like, I am. Okay.

1238
01:12:24,801 --> 01:12:28,310
There was this piece in the New York
Times, which was a, uh, sort of a,

1239
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:33,440
it wasn't a takedown piece because it was
too funny. It was like a parody piece,

1240
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:38,690
uh, related to the four hour body. And the
guy was like, it's like the New England,

1241
01:12:39,340 --> 01:12:40,490
uh,
what would he say?

1242
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:43,520
It was like the New England Journal
of health or something like that.

1243
01:12:43,521 --> 01:12:45,910
I was hijacked by the skymall
catalog or whatever, and he was like,

1244
01:12:45,950 --> 01:12:48,530
actually very funny stuff.
Didn't bother me at all.

1245
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:50,870
But then there's someone
who tries to be funny,

1246
01:12:50,871 --> 01:12:53,870
but it's not a good writer who
slams me. And I'm like, no, no, no.

1247
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:57,590
If you're Gunna do it, yeah. If
you're gonna do it, do it. Well,

1248
01:12:57,650 --> 01:13:00,470
I always say, uh, in order
for a roast joke to work,

1249
01:13:00,471 --> 01:13:05,150
it has to be funnier than it is mean. Ah.
So if it's not funnier than it is mean,

1250
01:13:05,151 --> 01:13:08,360
it's always going to bomb. So it's like
you're walking this tightrope of like,

1251
01:13:08,361 --> 01:13:11,570
if you're going to make it a joke,
at better be an a plus joke.

1252
01:13:11,571 --> 01:13:14,270
If you make a c h joke, you get
a boo. If you make an April,

1253
01:13:14,450 --> 01:13:17,780
which is sort of what I like. Excuse
me, I'm being attacked by bugs. Um,

1254
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:20,660
something that I loved about the
roast is sort of the math of it.

1255
01:13:20,661 --> 01:13:22,100
Cause those jokes are all math jokes.

1256
01:13:22,490 --> 01:13:27,320
You know what I think about the adding
and subtracting a word can completely

1257
01:13:27,321 --> 01:13:31,640
change the response there. They basically
tight Catskills jokes. For example,

1258
01:13:31,641 --> 01:13:33,950
one of my favorite jokes,
I'm cause I won't say my own jokes,

1259
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:37,130
cause that would be
narcissistic and give me shame.

1260
01:13:37,130 --> 01:13:41,330
So I'll say one of my favorite, uh, Rose
Comedians, Jeff the ledge, Greg Geraldo,

1261
01:13:41,990 --> 01:13:45,740
he had a joke for ice tea once.
He said ice tea. You're so old.

1262
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:49,160
You used your first residual
check to buy your freedom,

1263
01:13:49,820 --> 01:13:53,790
which is just a brilliant joke.
Um, but it's all math, you know,

1264
01:13:53,900 --> 01:13:58,460
it's just set up turn, you know. Those
were the kind of jokes that, uh, you know,

1265
01:13:58,461 --> 01:14:00,160
we do with the roasts
where it's like a few,

1266
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:04,250
any other word combination would
not be as funny. Yeah. You know,

1267
01:14:04,251 --> 01:14:08,090
you change one word. Um,
I remember, uh, some more,

1268
01:14:08,210 --> 01:14:13,030
I wrote this joke that was, it's a
horrible, really dark joke, but, um,

1269
01:14:13,330 --> 01:14:16,870
I said, uh, it was a flavor flavor host.
I was right around that. And it was,

1270
01:14:16,871 --> 01:14:20,950
the joke was flave you look like what
Magic Johnson should look like. Right.

1271
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:28,440
So I wrote that joke and she
delivered it in a way that it moms,

1272
01:14:30,910 --> 01:14:34,690
she was like, you look like how Magic
Johnson should be looking right now.

1273
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:39,070
And it's just too many words. So I, yes,

1274
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:40,630
I love the economy of words.

1275
01:14:40,631 --> 01:14:43,600
You can take two words out
and use a different screen
laughing and pause. Break.

1276
01:14:43,650 --> 01:14:48,400
Yeah. So that kind of stuff is still feel
like Twitter is good training for that.

1277
01:14:48,430 --> 01:14:51,000
Interesting. Yeah. I've,

1278
01:14:51,001 --> 01:14:54,480
I've been astonished when I tried to
draft something and I'm like, God damn it,

1279
01:14:54,481 --> 01:14:58,570
you know, negative 23, oh, how
do I get what I want to keep it,

1280
01:14:58,571 --> 01:15:00,930
I want to keep it and then I trim it down
and I'm like, it's so much better. Yeah.

1281
01:15:01,060 --> 01:15:03,670
Concision is Yep.
100%.

1282
01:15:03,910 --> 01:15:07,840
So I love that is sort of something I
loved about the roast ultimately. Um,

1283
01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:09,000
you know,
I think that rose,

1284
01:15:09,001 --> 01:15:12,250
so I think it's important to know when
to to stop doing something. You know,

1285
01:15:12,251 --> 01:15:17,251
one of my favorite Steve jobs things is
what I don't make is just as important

1286
01:15:17,351 --> 01:15:18,490
as what I do make sure,
right?

1287
01:15:18,491 --> 01:15:21,580
Like what you say no to is just as has
just as big of an impact on your career.

1288
01:15:21,581 --> 01:15:24,780
So I did three of them and it
felt like, you know, that was,

1289
01:15:24,790 --> 01:15:28,870
I was getting known as the roast girl
and I was getting known as this insult

1290
01:15:28,871 --> 01:15:30,730
mean insult comic.
And I'm not like that at all.

1291
01:15:30,731 --> 01:15:35,731
I'm like the super fragile sort of scare
Burson and I would have by being an

1292
01:15:36,821 --> 01:15:38,920
airport and someone be like,
Hey Kotton I'd be like Whoa,

1293
01:15:38,921 --> 01:15:40,780
it's two o'clock on a Tuesday.

1294
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:44,470
Like if people just thought they could
talk to me like that and it would really

1295
01:15:44,471 --> 01:15:46,660
freak me out. It's crazy.
People would say that.

1296
01:15:46,661 --> 01:15:49,600
Words like that to me on the
street, it's so wild. I mean it's,

1297
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:51,040
it's very unusual dynamic.

1298
01:15:51,041 --> 01:15:55,060
Obviously when you're public facing
and people feel like they know you

1299
01:15:55,061 --> 01:15:58,690
intimately and in some cases they,
they might right.

1300
01:15:58,691 --> 01:16:00,640
If they've read all your stuff,
washed all your stuff,

1301
01:16:00,641 --> 01:16:04,810
they actually probably know quite a lot
about you but you can have that type of

1302
01:16:04,811 --> 01:16:08,470
experience or like I'll have guys come
up to me in the like I'll be taking a

1303
01:16:08,471 --> 01:16:12,370
piss at a urinal and some guy like come
up and like give you a slap on the back

1304
01:16:12,371 --> 01:16:13,810
and start like kind of breathing into my,

1305
01:16:13,811 --> 01:16:17,250
you're talking to me as if he's
like my buddy from high school.

1306
01:16:18,610 --> 01:16:22,090
Never. Yeah. Speaking with
there. I did. Granted,

1307
01:16:22,091 --> 01:16:26,300
I did respond to that for a good time
call and the inside of the bathroom I was

1308
01:16:26,301 --> 01:16:29,830
in an airport, you know, surprise
me, especially in the airport.

1309
01:16:29,831 --> 01:16:31,810
I'm thinking security,
the guy must work here.

1310
01:16:31,810 --> 01:16:35,260
Isn't that a violation of some
kind of TSA regulation? But uh,

1311
01:16:35,350 --> 01:16:39,040
it is very interesting
because I think, uh, you know,

1312
01:16:39,041 --> 01:16:43,270
when it's so rewarding to be able to
share the intimate details of your life

1313
01:16:43,271 --> 01:16:46,630
with people and help people laugh at it
or in your case, help them, you know,

1314
01:16:46,870 --> 01:16:49,510
with their confidence or their
business or their goals or whatever.

1315
01:16:49,511 --> 01:16:50,390
But people laugh at me

1316
01:16:52,380 --> 01:16:56,080
and then to sort of compromise
this level of privacy. It's,

1317
01:16:56,670 --> 01:16:59,800
it's usually okay for me,
but I just don't have very thick skin.

1318
01:17:00,130 --> 01:17:04,000
And I have this theory that
the third thing someone says,

1319
01:17:04,030 --> 01:17:08,440
a stranger says to you is always
an insult. Hey, such a big fan.

1320
01:17:08,441 --> 01:17:10,070
Love your work.
You're so much bigger

1321
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:13,970
in person. Cause the third one
is always there. Honest answer.

1322
01:17:13,971 --> 01:17:16,310
The first two is just their adulation.

1323
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:20,480
So I always try to just get out after
the second compliment. That's really,

1324
01:17:20,481 --> 01:17:24,540
that's really funny. Yeah.
I was listening to, uh,

1325
01:17:24,620 --> 01:17:29,570
I'm an avid consumer of, of stand up.
Definitely afraid of ever doing it.

1326
01:17:29,650 --> 01:17:33,700
That's a, that's something maybe
talking about, but uh, I think it was,

1327
01:17:33,701 --> 01:17:38,120
I was other Demitri Martin or Mitch
Hedberg love I think when they're saying,

1328
01:17:38,121 --> 01:17:38,241
you know,

1329
01:17:38,241 --> 01:17:40,910
when like when I take photos I like to
count to five because that's when people

1330
01:17:40,911 --> 01:17:44,390
get real play one here.

1331
01:17:44,391 --> 01:17:48,990
It's coming to the last tier
three smile for what? Five,

1332
01:17:49,130 --> 01:17:53,360
what the fuck. And then
I take the photo. So fun.

1333
01:17:53,370 --> 01:17:55,800
I'd like to meet Jay.
Demetrius linear. Yes.

1334
01:17:55,900 --> 01:17:58,300
Great. He has a lot of great
photo jokes. He was, he's like,

1335
01:17:58,301 --> 01:18:02,260
I love a camera phones cause
you can reminisce immediately.

1336
01:18:03,090 --> 01:18:07,530
We were so young. He has his, a lot of
good word play jokes too. So it's like

1337
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:10,270
delightful,
playful joke.

1338
01:18:10,390 --> 01:18:13,480
Yeah. Like the silent, the silent G. Yeah.

1339
01:18:13,481 --> 01:18:17,850
We use that screw up foreigners like in
foreigner. I'm right there, you know. So

1340
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:20,800
hello. It's such a, um, you know, there's
a lot of different kinds of comedy.

1341
01:18:20,801 --> 01:18:23,420
I had a sort of argument about
this with someone recently.

1342
01:18:23,421 --> 01:18:25,630
It was a kind of notion would
come you so negative, you know,

1343
01:18:25,631 --> 01:18:28,690
and it was like there's a lots of
different kinds of comedy is just like,

1344
01:18:28,691 --> 01:18:33,010
there's lots of different kinds of music
and art and whatever. Um, but you know,

1345
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:36,800
Dimitri and, and um,
Zach Galifianakis and uh,

1346
01:18:37,170 --> 01:18:40,800
Mitch Hedberg and Steven Wright are
in this sort of Ashkelon of certain,

1347
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:44,940
this playful tickling sort of
stuff. I mean, like Dimitri,

1348
01:18:44,950 --> 01:18:46,720
one of my favorite jokes of
his, his, he's like, you know,

1349
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:49,750
it's like people always want to show
me photos of their kids and then I show

1350
01:18:49,751 --> 01:18:50,830
them photos of their kids and

1351
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:54,650
think I'm weird. I mean it's just
little stuff like that that's sort of

1352
01:18:54,850 --> 01:18:59,500
fantastical, surreal comedy
should the economy to it. I mean,

1353
01:18:59,501 --> 01:19:03,970
which I really like also. It's like
precise Haiku comedy. Yeah. It's very fun.

1354
01:19:03,971 --> 01:19:06,580
It's repeatable. There's something
democratic about it cause you can,

1355
01:19:06,820 --> 01:19:07,870
you can't rehearse,

1356
01:19:07,950 --> 01:19:11,980
say one of my beds to someone that's long
and convoluted and requires too much.

1357
01:19:12,010 --> 01:19:16,970
It requires too much narrative
practice. It's physical. You know,

1358
01:19:16,990 --> 01:19:19,900
there's also a guy named Dan [inaudible]
who tells the kind of jokes that you

1359
01:19:19,901 --> 01:19:23,200
can easily suppose. Man's m. I. N. T, z.

1360
01:19:23,201 --> 01:19:28,000
He wrote for Louis C K show on
HBO. Uh, he's doing something now,

1361
01:19:28,001 --> 01:19:32,720
but, um, he has a great show. Kiko
is a, it's a little bit, you know,

1362
01:19:32,740 --> 01:19:35,140
blue, but he goes, um, he goes, you know,

1363
01:19:35,141 --> 01:19:38,710
it'd be really confusing if someone was
performing an abortion and someone ran

1364
01:19:38,711 --> 01:19:40,800
in and yelled,
abort a horse.

1365
01:19:41,820 --> 01:19:46,260
Oh God, that is blue. It's very fun.
It's obviously a joke, you know,

1366
01:19:46,261 --> 01:19:49,950
but it's just one of those is you hear
it once and you can repeat it a parties

1367
01:19:49,951 --> 01:19:52,680
forever, you know, it's
like the one, I'm not,

1368
01:19:52,690 --> 01:19:56,890
not to make this the Dmitri Martin's
show, but yeah. Uh, the, uh,

1369
01:19:57,080 --> 01:20:00,690
the one, uh, I think this is
all on the same album too,

1370
01:20:00,691 --> 01:20:05,040
and I'm blanking on the name of the album,
but he says, he says like, you know,

1371
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:07,500
it's along the lines of, you know, like

1372
01:20:08,490 --> 01:20:13,100
what does it, what does a Dalmatian
think when he sees a cow? You're like,

1373
01:20:13,890 --> 01:20:18,090
am I hiring? And then the
cows, like he looks amazing.

1374
01:20:19,220 --> 01:20:20,910
I like to tell the ground over here.
You know,

1375
01:20:21,690 --> 01:20:24,920
it was like a part of your brain that's
never activate like things where you're

1376
01:20:24,921 --> 01:20:28,070
like, I've never thought about
that. But I mean think about it.

1377
01:20:28,071 --> 01:20:31,490
People like us and anyone who's listening
to this is probably an overthinker,

1378
01:20:31,491 --> 01:20:35,060
but we've thought of everything, you know,
we've overthought everything 50 times.

1379
01:20:35,061 --> 01:20:38,240
And so when someone puts of the visual
in your mind that you've literally never

1380
01:20:38,241 --> 01:20:41,740
entertained, it's just so like, it's
like being a kid again or something.

1381
01:20:41,750 --> 01:20:42,710
That's what I feel watching it.

1382
01:20:42,770 --> 01:20:46,960
Mitri uh, the um, the
roast. Yes. Thinking Bruce,

1383
01:20:47,050 --> 01:20:48,830
part of what makes them so

1384
01:20:50,510 --> 01:20:55,190
different now aside from the fact
that you have non comedians being like

1385
01:20:55,191 --> 01:20:59,960
harpooned by 20 professionals is a,
that it's preserved.

1386
01:21:00,110 --> 01:21:03,410
So instead of being in a
club with an expiration date,

1387
01:21:03,411 --> 01:21:07,130
that was the end of the day. It's
on youtube, comedy central forever.

1388
01:21:07,160 --> 01:21:11,460
Good plant and a very different
sort of persistence. Yeah. Yeah.

1389
01:21:11,770 --> 01:21:15,610
Well also I see the roasts
as more of a sport. Like,

1390
01:21:15,611 --> 01:21:18,910
it's like watching boxing or football or
something where you're watching someone,

1391
01:21:18,911 --> 01:21:21,850
you know, get schooled and someone comes
back and bites him back and you know,

1392
01:21:21,851 --> 01:21:26,320
it's, I think that activates that very
primal part of your brain of kick his ass.

1393
01:21:26,410 --> 01:21:30,070
Yeah. You know, and I think I, you
know, it started getting so nasty and,

1394
01:21:30,071 --> 01:21:33,910
and I think the roasts were better.
They're better when you're the underdog,

1395
01:21:34,510 --> 01:21:38,140
you know? And people like to see a
Rudy come on, you know? So I for it,

1396
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:41,680
but in my first roast and it was like,
who's this girl? And then I, you know,

1397
01:21:41,710 --> 01:21:43,570
came out of the gate and
like knew what I was doing.

1398
01:21:43,571 --> 01:21:46,570
And then when I started to sort of,
it was like my,

1399
01:21:46,690 --> 01:21:49,870
I had an acumen for it and people start
to expect all of a sudden when people

1400
01:21:49,871 --> 01:21:52,900
expect you to be good, I think we're
down. So then they think either you suck,

1401
01:21:52,930 --> 01:21:55,630
you're like, wait a minute, you thought
it was great when you never heard of me,

1402
01:21:55,631 --> 01:21:58,300
now you've heard of me, and now you want,
you know, everyone wants to build you up.

1403
01:21:58,301 --> 01:22:02,100
So they can just tear you down. Yeah.
And then I felt like, okay, right.

1404
01:22:02,130 --> 01:22:04,880
It's good to know when to go out and,
um,

1405
01:22:04,910 --> 01:22:07,300
and I'm sure she'd be fine with me
sharing this, but then the last,

1406
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:11,610
the Donald Trump rose, Lisa Lampanelli
and I, we just cried after the roast.

1407
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:15,880
We were like, it was just two below
the belt. It was like, yeah. You know,

1408
01:22:15,881 --> 01:22:19,600
the Goto for me and I, again, I've
been in the writer's room of the roast.

1409
01:22:19,630 --> 01:22:21,130
I know the math of it.

1410
01:22:21,131 --> 01:22:23,380
I know that it's like we're going
to make fun of what you look like.

1411
01:22:23,650 --> 01:22:28,450
I try to not make fun of things about
people that they can't control as a

1412
01:22:28,451 --> 01:22:32,190
general rule. Yeah. Cause it
just feels a little too mean. Um,

1413
01:22:32,250 --> 01:22:36,250
with the exception of some jokes I
wrote about carrot top, but come on. Um,

1414
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:40,600
uh, but I regret those and
then I feel bad about them. Um,

1415
01:22:41,050 --> 01:22:43,270
and that one was just a
little below the belt.

1416
01:22:43,271 --> 01:22:45,840
It was like people were calling me a slut.

1417
01:22:45,970 --> 01:22:50,290
Like I was in a relationship at the time.
It was just like, what are you doing?

1418
01:22:50,291 --> 01:22:52,630
Like this didn't cause an argument.
Like it was just,

1419
01:22:53,330 --> 01:22:57,970
it's so salacious and incendiary
that I felt like I, it was,

1420
01:22:58,240 --> 01:23:00,730
I was so,
it just hurt my feelings after awhile.

1421
01:23:00,790 --> 01:23:02,470
And Lisa Lampanelli and I were both like,

1422
01:23:02,471 --> 01:23:05,200
she had just lost all this weight and
they used to make fun of how, you know,

1423
01:23:05,201 --> 01:23:07,870
that she was overweight and she had lost
weight and now they're making five skin.

1424
01:23:07,890 --> 01:23:12,280
It was just like, oh, you can't win. It's
whack them all. Yeah. You know? So, uh,

1425
01:23:12,790 --> 01:23:16,800
we were like, I think it's probably
good to switch. Take a break. Yes.

1426
01:23:17,140 --> 01:23:18,010
Switch sports.

1427
01:23:18,210 --> 01:23:22,410
What, um, what would you do if you had,

1428
01:23:22,411 --> 01:23:24,900
say this is all hypothetical,

1429
01:23:24,901 --> 01:23:29,580
obviously eight weeks you take someone
who's never done standup but has spent a

1430
01:23:29,581 --> 01:23:34,260
little bit of time on the stage. Yeah.
Let's call that person a friend of mine.

1431
01:23:36,050 --> 01:23:38,120
I, he just wondering for myself, uh,

1432
01:23:39,050 --> 01:23:44,050
eight weeks to get them ready to do five
minutes on stage at like an open mic.

1433
01:23:45,230 --> 01:23:47,780
Right. Uh, what would you do?

1434
01:23:48,380 --> 01:23:52,940
Uh, that's a great question. I would
get them on stage the first night,

1435
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:57,620
the first night. Yep. First Day of
eight weeks. Yep. Okay. And this entire,

1436
01:23:57,710 --> 01:24:00,860
every night for all of the eight weeks,
whether they had material or not,

1437
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:06,520
because the material is like 10%
of it being comfortable on stage.

1438
01:24:07,041 --> 01:24:09,890
It's all of it, you know. So I
would say just get on stages.

1439
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:12,560
I say always say the
first year and a half,

1440
01:24:12,561 --> 01:24:14,660
two years of standup is just
getting comfortable on stage here.

1441
01:24:14,661 --> 01:24:19,040
Material doesn't matter.
Like it's like, um, uh,

1442
01:24:19,310 --> 01:24:21,740
boxing or whatever, you know. Um, but, uh,

1443
01:24:21,770 --> 01:24:24,330
I would just say get on stage
as much as possible and um,

1444
01:24:24,410 --> 01:24:27,110
because your material and the for the
first couple of years is never going to,

1445
01:24:27,170 --> 01:24:30,830
no one's ever going to see it, you know,
it's just an excuse to get up there. Um,

1446
01:24:30,890 --> 01:24:35,890
and I would also ascertain where they
are in terms of their self awareness and

1447
01:24:36,231 --> 01:24:40,670
PR and opinion. Like I would ask them
50 questions about where they're from,

1448
01:24:40,700 --> 01:24:41,550
what makes them different.

1449
01:24:41,551 --> 01:24:44,600
Because I think a lot of people have
this dysmorphic view about what's

1450
01:24:44,601 --> 01:24:49,030
interesting about them. So I have
this girlfriend, she's a comedian. Uh,

1451
01:24:49,130 --> 01:24:50,640
and what was the thing? Oh, uh,

1452
01:24:50,930 --> 01:24:54,440
she goes on stage and she was talking
about like smoking pot and hooking up with

1453
01:24:54,441 --> 01:24:55,400
guys and you know,

1454
01:24:55,401 --> 01:24:59,090
she's sort of a younger comedian and it
was just sort of everyone kind of does

1455
01:24:59,091 --> 01:24:59,271
that.

1456
01:24:59,271 --> 01:25:02,270
And then later I found out that she was
a competitive diver in college and I was

1457
01:25:02,271 --> 01:25:05,690
like, why don't you talk about that? I
have in your mind to that. And she's like,

1458
01:25:05,691 --> 01:25:09,290
oh no, I mean it just seems boring.
I'm like, no one else has that.

1459
01:25:09,380 --> 01:25:12,080
Like I'll do it if you don't do
it, I'm stealing it. You know,

1460
01:25:12,081 --> 01:25:13,260
like a lot of people,

1461
01:25:13,460 --> 01:25:15,500
a lot of times people don't know
what's interesting about them.

1462
01:25:15,860 --> 01:25:18,710
So it takes a while. Cause
I think we all, you know,

1463
01:25:18,711 --> 01:25:22,730
are so sick of ourselves in some ways
are we inflate things and deflate other

1464
01:25:22,731 --> 01:25:25,070
things and have denial about things.
Um,

1465
01:25:25,490 --> 01:25:28,850
so tap into what's makes you,
you and why.

1466
01:25:28,851 --> 01:25:30,800
What's interesting about you
also help you figure out,

1467
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:34,070
it took me a long time to realize
that as soon as you get on stage,

1468
01:25:34,071 --> 01:25:36,110
you need to address what the
audience is already thinking.

1469
01:25:36,380 --> 01:25:37,310
I was just going to ask

1470
01:25:37,610 --> 01:25:40,460
if you like if you grabbed the gun
and shoot yourself with it before.

1471
01:25:40,890 --> 01:25:44,230
Yup. Yup. So they, uh, I don't
know who says this quote that um,

1472
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:47,920
comedians become comedians so they
can control why people laugh at them.

1473
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:53,320
Just so interesting. So for me, I really,
I wish I could do that. I need this skill.

1474
01:25:53,890 --> 01:25:58,030
I realized right away that people thought
my last name being Cummings was funny.

1475
01:25:58,110 --> 01:25:59,560
Yeah.
And I didn't never understood.

1476
01:25:59,561 --> 01:26:02,260
So I get onstage and I started
talking and then I'd be like, oh,

1477
01:26:02,261 --> 01:26:03,980
my last name is comics.
Everyone start laughing.

1478
01:26:03,981 --> 01:26:06,170
Like she just put the
needle in the balloon. Now

1479
01:26:06,310 --> 01:26:11,140
I can move on. You know,
your tweets. What was it?

1480
01:26:11,141 --> 01:26:14,650
I wouldn't let any husband take my last
name unless it's first name is Dick

1481
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:19,270
thought that was pretty good. Always
held out as husband took her last name.

1482
01:26:19,271 --> 01:26:22,120
I think. I was like, thinking about it.
Um, you know, cause I always say like,

1483
01:26:22,121 --> 01:26:23,170
people are like, do you
wanna get married? I'm like,

1484
01:26:23,171 --> 01:26:25,210
I just want to change my last name.
You don't have to marry me,

1485
01:26:25,211 --> 01:26:26,710
but can I just take your last name?

1486
01:26:27,460 --> 01:26:32,170
We don't have to sign anything and my
last name be verus bleed. Um, but I have,

1487
01:26:32,171 --> 01:26:35,230
I am grateful to that last name because
I think at a very young age I had to

1488
01:26:35,231 --> 01:26:39,580
learn to defend myself against ridicule.
So I, you know, had to get quick.

1489
01:26:39,581 --> 01:26:40,414
Witted um,

1490
01:26:40,750 --> 01:26:44,050
so how would you do an
inventory for someone to figure
out what those things are

1491
01:26:44,140 --> 01:26:44,681
about them?
Yeah,

1492
01:26:44,681 --> 01:26:47,440
so you can like slay the pink
elephants before they have a chance to,

1493
01:26:47,441 --> 01:26:48,274
like I would ask,

1494
01:26:48,630 --> 01:26:53,250
right. I would, um, you know,
I'm very, uh, very direct person.

1495
01:26:53,251 --> 01:26:55,680
Like I remember seeing a, you
know, there's a lot of like, um,

1496
01:26:55,740 --> 01:26:58,320
I don't know what is the social and
the politically correct thing to say.

1497
01:26:58,710 --> 01:26:59,760
Is it little people now?

1498
01:27:01,660 --> 01:27:03,800
Is it not endorsed?

1499
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:09,470
I don't know what the proper
term is. A little people. Okay.

1500
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:13,240
I think midgets,
not the m word is the new n word.

1501
01:27:14,290 --> 01:27:18,850
And we're definitely not, and not the
Amara calling her calling food oriented.

1502
01:27:19,810 --> 01:27:22,600
I, it's a little people.
So a friend of mine,

1503
01:27:22,630 --> 01:27:25,760
it's a little person and
he's a comedian and uh,

1504
01:27:25,870 --> 01:27:29,050
he goes on stage and he's just like, so I
was with this girl then I was like, you,

1505
01:27:29,170 --> 01:27:33,010
your first 10 minutes is talking about
being a little barbs barbicide now how do

1506
01:27:33,011 --> 01:27:38,011
you prevent that from being much like
going after Donald Trump for the hair,

1507
01:27:38,260 --> 01:27:43,240
right? Two obvious. Like they expect
you to do that. Well, first you have to,

1508
01:27:43,570 --> 01:27:45,940
I mean it's, you know, a lot of
people say standup is like sex,

1509
01:27:45,941 --> 01:27:48,130
but like you have to be in

1510
01:27:48,290 --> 01:27:49,670
it's really malicious and very,

1511
01:27:49,671 --> 01:27:54,180
really malicious and violence
and like 10 minutes long. Um, uh,

1512
01:27:54,230 --> 01:27:57,430
basically you have to admit it to,
what am I staying?

1513
01:27:59,630 --> 01:28:03,020
Secret to happiness is low expectations.
Please four hour work week,

1514
01:28:03,021 --> 01:28:05,500
the four minutes,
um,

1515
01:28:06,490 --> 01:28:09,640
and, but you have to understand what
their needs are and be able to feed and

1516
01:28:09,641 --> 01:28:10,540
ascertain.
Like I say,

1517
01:28:10,541 --> 01:28:13,240
so much of comedy is just
listening and it's a conversation.

1518
01:28:13,270 --> 01:28:14,950
It seems like a monologue ostensibly,

1519
01:28:14,951 --> 01:28:17,830
but it's actually a conversation so
you're constantly checking in with them.

1520
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:21,280
I always tell a lot of comedians who in
the beginning aren't doing well and I'm

1521
01:28:21,281 --> 01:28:23,500
like, well, are you making eye
contact with the people in the crowd?

1522
01:28:23,501 --> 01:28:28,090
And there was like, no. I'm like, oh, it's
so intimate. Like you have to, I mean,

1523
01:28:28,091 --> 01:28:30,280
I literally look all of them
in the eyes all the time. It's,

1524
01:28:30,281 --> 01:28:33,550
you're constantly checking in, constantly
checking in. The sound is one thing,

1525
01:28:33,551 --> 01:28:37,720
but you also have to be checking in with
them and knowing what they need from

1526
01:28:37,721 --> 01:28:39,610
you, you know? And so for me,

1527
01:28:39,611 --> 01:28:41,860
the first couple years I had
to address the last name,

1528
01:28:41,861 --> 01:28:44,500
Cummings in the beginning
everyone was like, cool,

1529
01:28:44,530 --> 01:28:46,450
we don't have to think about this
anymore because other people did too.

1530
01:28:46,451 --> 01:28:49,060
They just hit Cummings is her last name,
comma, and then they're distracted.

1531
01:28:49,061 --> 01:28:52,990
So you just have to take it off the
table or we, can we move on here? Okay.

1532
01:28:52,991 --> 01:28:55,940
My last name is Cummings. Now let's
get to some other stuff. I've always,

1533
01:28:57,960 --> 01:29:00,700
it's one of these things where
you think it's going to get old.

1534
01:29:00,770 --> 01:29:01,900
I'll you what it is,
it's

1535
01:29:01,990 --> 01:29:06,730
Jim Gaffigan's voice that he
does to imitate the crowd. Yeah,

1536
01:29:08,250 --> 01:29:12,750
exactly. It's so empowering. That's
freedom. Yeah. And just the, yeah,

1537
01:29:12,751 --> 01:29:15,360
I just thought it was
such a, it's such a, uh,

1538
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:19,350
such a clean,
that kind of elegant way

1539
01:29:19,420 --> 01:29:23,620
the audience in on nail it. Yes. You know?
Yeah. It's so great because it, it just,

1540
01:29:23,830 --> 01:29:26,500
it takes the elephant, like you said,
out of the living room. You know,

1541
01:29:26,501 --> 01:29:29,410
another thing I did recently and just
when I kind of thought, okay, enough,

1542
01:29:29,411 --> 01:29:32,620
people know me, I don't have to. Um, so I,

1543
01:29:33,340 --> 01:29:37,780
this is such a weird thing to say. Uh,
I like get like, I mean I put a lot of,

1544
01:29:38,290 --> 01:29:40,480
I take good care of my skin.
I try at least.

1545
01:29:40,740 --> 01:29:42,810
But one of the crowd questions was,
how is your,

1546
01:29:43,190 --> 01:29:46,670
how do you get your skin so glowing?
So maybe, so maybe you could explain,

1547
01:29:47,160 --> 01:29:48,580
talk about that. Um, but,

1548
01:29:48,970 --> 01:29:53,260
but sometimes on stage it I look
really shiny and I look all the time,

1549
01:29:53,370 --> 01:29:55,750
we know that this is what you're,
I mean I can't totally,

1550
01:29:55,751 --> 01:29:57,760
but you look just like your
my face cause you look good.

1551
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:00,640
You're just like an orb of light.

1552
01:30:00,700 --> 01:30:04,840
Yeah but the same as me so I get really
shiny and then one time I was on stage

1553
01:30:04,841 --> 01:30:06,520
and I was like do I look really shiny?

1554
01:30:06,521 --> 01:30:10,090
And everyone just burst out laughing
because it was like the elephant in the

1555
01:30:10,091 --> 01:30:14,740
living room. I'm like why is
she wet coming from a storm?

1556
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:17,260
And I was like Oh my God you guys,
I'm not wearing any makeup.

1557
01:30:17,261 --> 01:30:21,820
And I put like cream like oil on before
I came onstage number was like oh like

1558
01:30:21,821 --> 01:30:24,070
it was like now we can talk about that.
We can move on right now.

1559
01:30:24,071 --> 01:30:25,630
I can pay attention to what you're saying.
Totally.

1560
01:30:25,631 --> 01:30:28,360
So it's like just sort of being able
to have that kind of self awareness,

1561
01:30:28,361 --> 01:30:29,194
which is,

1562
01:30:29,290 --> 01:30:31,840
it's hard because it's like you want
self awareness but you don't want self

1563
01:30:31,841 --> 01:30:35,420
absorption. You want to be able to
self reflect would not be a narcissist.

1564
01:30:35,450 --> 01:30:38,530
You have to, you know, it's,
it's, it's a delicate balance.

1565
01:30:38,531 --> 01:30:39,570
I think I would also work,

1566
01:30:39,710 --> 01:30:42,240
who are some comedians who come to
mind like right off the bat, I'm sure,

1567
01:30:42,290 --> 01:30:45,410
I mean there are a lot of
really good comedians out
there, but just like offhand,

1568
01:30:45,610 --> 01:30:49,760
people who are good at walking
that tightrope between self aware

1569
01:30:50,110 --> 01:30:54,670
and self absorbed. Ooh,
good. Um, good, good,

1570
01:30:54,671 --> 01:30:59,470
good, great question.
David. Tell, Oh yeah,

1571
01:30:59,860 --> 01:31:04,810
David Tell I couldn't have
more love for David towl. No,

1572
01:31:04,870 --> 01:31:08,320
kind of, I feel like he's
not, he doesn't penetrate,

1573
01:31:08,590 --> 01:31:13,360
I mean too much emotionally. Like I
feel like Dave's not super vulnerable,

1574
01:31:13,361 --> 01:31:16,750
at least onstage, offstage. He is. Um,

1575
01:31:17,020 --> 01:31:22,020
but I would say like is a great Greg Bill
Burr Bill Burr Wilbur is a monster and

1576
01:31:23,650 --> 01:31:27,430
he has this great ability
to, I mean he's, you know,

1577
01:31:27,431 --> 01:31:30,850
on stage is somewhat obsessive
and neurotic and you know,

1578
01:31:30,851 --> 01:31:34,540
he's got podcasts and he, you know,
um, gets really obsessed with things,

1579
01:31:34,541 --> 01:31:37,510
but he's able to move on real quickly
and not make it about him. It's,

1580
01:31:37,511 --> 01:31:39,870
he's not myopic, you know, he's a

1581
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:41,790
really good at responding
to the crowd too.

1582
01:31:42,310 --> 01:31:46,340
And he'll say something and he's
really, really good and he'll go, Ooh,

1583
01:31:46,680 --> 01:31:49,170
I lose Ya. You were with me and
now I feel like you're pulling it

1584
01:31:49,640 --> 01:31:53,330
when he does that because even
in it, and it's such a, you know,

1585
01:31:53,331 --> 01:31:55,520
maybe this will interest your fans that,

1586
01:31:55,521 --> 01:32:00,521
that he is one of my favorite comedians
to watch because he will almost ordain a

1587
01:32:02,681 --> 01:32:04,330
bombing so that he can,

1588
01:32:04,360 --> 01:32:07,420
because he's so successful now and I've
seen him be on stage and just be killing

1589
01:32:07,421 --> 01:32:09,920
and he's like, that wasn't that
funny. You're laughing cause he wants,

1590
01:32:10,010 --> 01:32:11,680
he'll like premeditated.
He,

1591
01:32:11,740 --> 01:32:16,010
he'll sort of like Holby like black
people are different and people go ooh.

1592
01:32:16,011 --> 01:32:17,050
And he'll be like,
just let me,

1593
01:32:17,110 --> 01:32:20,050
so he'll throw at something so incendiary
that he loses the crowd like on

1594
01:32:20,051 --> 01:32:21,520
purpose just so we can get them back.

1595
01:32:22,420 --> 01:32:27,420
Which is so cool because it's like what
do you do when you're that skilled is

1596
01:32:28,121 --> 01:32:29,650
you have to keep it so you don't plateau.

1597
01:32:29,651 --> 01:32:33,340
You have to keep creating Roy Jones jr
at his peak when he would just like drop

1598
01:32:33,341 --> 01:32:36,370
his arms and do these like rooster
fighting posture is cause he's like,

1599
01:32:36,371 --> 01:32:39,950
how do I make this interesting for myself?
100%. That's exactly it. You know, I,

1600
01:32:39,970 --> 01:32:44,380
it doesn't Laird Hamilton, uh,
uh, swim with a cement block.

1601
01:32:44,710 --> 01:32:49,510
He does exercise, uh, in
pools underwater with weights.

1602
01:32:49,540 --> 01:32:51,880
Yeah. Something like Riddick
where you're just like, oh,

1603
01:32:51,881 --> 01:32:54,910
you're just bored at this
point. Um, so I'll see him,

1604
01:32:54,911 --> 01:32:56,800
he'll throw something out
where he'll be like, you know,

1605
01:32:56,801 --> 01:33:01,060
maybe the Holocaust was good for us. And
then everyone's like, Ooh. And he's like,

1606
01:33:01,061 --> 01:33:03,040
well, and then he gets
a Mac. Right. You know,

1607
01:33:03,041 --> 01:33:05,740
and it's like he'll throw something out
that you think is like the point of no

1608
01:33:05,741 --> 01:33:09,430
return. You think like his
career is over and, uh,

1609
01:33:09,910 --> 01:33:14,550
and then he gets a Mac, you know, so he's
so cool, but he's not like, you know,

1610
01:33:15,370 --> 01:33:18,880
a narcissist. He's not stuck in his
own. I think one of the biggest dangers,

1611
01:33:19,170 --> 01:33:20,050
you know,
as a comedian,

1612
01:33:20,051 --> 01:33:22,840
and I always worry about comedians who
aren't friends with other comedians

1613
01:33:22,841 --> 01:33:27,310
because we're who we check each other
and keep each other sort of sane is when

1614
01:33:27,311 --> 01:33:29,590
comedians get to sequestered they,

1615
01:33:29,620 --> 01:33:34,030
or any big personality or someone with
opinions who ends up being surrounded by

1616
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:38,110
staff and the Jim Carey's of the world
who gets sequestered and all of a sudden

1617
01:33:38,111 --> 01:33:42,430
they have no point of reference with
reality and that kind of lose touch. Um,

1618
01:33:42,460 --> 01:33:44,100
you know,
so bill is also great about,

1619
01:33:44,120 --> 01:33:46,990
he's in the trenches is the comedy store
every night. He's talking to people.

1620
01:33:46,991 --> 01:33:50,860
I mean, he's, that's part of the reason I
think is, you know, comedy song decisive.

1621
01:33:51,340 --> 01:33:56,170
Who are some of the most underrated
comedians? Great question.

1622
01:33:56,690 --> 01:33:59,740
Um, uh, great question. Sebastian.

1623
01:33:59,741 --> 01:34:03,370
Maniscalco that's a hell of a name.
It's a hell of a name a,

1624
01:34:03,390 --> 01:34:06,200
I'll send you his stuff.
He's, um, he's just

1625
01:34:07,750 --> 01:34:11,140
n I.
S C a.

1626
01:34:11,530 --> 01:34:15,670
L c o Sebastian is,
uh,

1627
01:34:15,690 --> 01:34:20,690
I encourage any creative people to
watch him because he is all Calco.

1628
01:34:21,820 --> 01:34:24,050
He, uh, has some Italian, uh,

1629
01:34:24,100 --> 01:34:29,100
blood and he's almost like a Brian
Regan or like a more flamboyant Jerry

1630
01:34:30,280 --> 01:34:33,610
Seinfeld. He's completely
clean. And I, this isn't,

1631
01:34:33,611 --> 01:34:36,280
he's one of my favorite comedians. So I
hope this doesn't come off pejorative,

1632
01:34:36,281 --> 01:34:40,000
but he almost doesn't have jokes per se.

1633
01:34:40,001 --> 01:34:43,590
Like if you were to transcribe his
act, you wouldn't see jokes. Huh?

1634
01:34:43,700 --> 01:34:48,370
It's so much in his performance and
essentially his sort of thing is just

1635
01:34:48,371 --> 01:34:51,130
discussed with humanity,
like whole,

1636
01:34:51,131 --> 01:34:54,460
and I'm not going to embarrass myself by
doing his act, but he'll just say like,

1637
01:34:54,461 --> 01:34:59,270
uh, he'd be like, so, uh, anybody
have the, uh, the Blue Ray? Like,

1638
01:34:59,271 --> 01:35:02,810
and he'll just like say facts
about the blue it right. His just,

1639
01:35:02,811 --> 01:35:07,811
his point of view is so specific and
authentic and he's so genuinely angry that

1640
01:35:10,371 --> 01:35:14,750
it's just hilarious. So it's like whatever
you are, be that if you're annoying,

1641
01:35:14,751 --> 01:35:17,780
be that if you're a republican,
it'd be like, whatever it is,

1642
01:35:17,810 --> 01:35:19,320
exaggerate what you already is.

1643
01:35:19,590 --> 01:35:22,910
As long as you're pretending to be someone
you're not, and the audience knows.

1644
01:35:23,030 --> 01:35:26,840
So stand up is the ultimate exercise
and accepting exactly who you are,

1645
01:35:26,841 --> 01:35:31,280
as ugly as it is,
as long as you tell the truth they're in,

1646
01:35:31,490 --> 01:35:33,740
because they can tell,
most people can tell when you're,

1647
01:35:34,010 --> 01:35:36,980
which is why equine therapy is
actually been really helpful for me.

1648
01:35:37,090 --> 01:35:41,910
So talk to me more about the
horses. What's, what's going on. So,

1649
01:35:41,960 --> 01:35:43,970
so the metastatic

1650
01:35:44,690 --> 01:35:47,990
oh yeah, it's smashing. It's got to go.
If, if any comedy nerds want to know more,

1651
01:35:48,010 --> 01:35:52,970
um, underrated people, uh,
Sebastian Maniscalco is great. Um,

1652
01:35:53,120 --> 01:35:56,410
Gerard Carmichael is great.
I think he's probably, um,

1653
01:35:56,990 --> 01:35:59,840
you're going to be hearing
his name a lot more soon.

1654
01:35:59,841 --> 01:36:04,790
Natasha Ligero is very funny. Tig Notaro
I'm sure you guys all know her by now.

1655
01:36:05,150 --> 01:36:08,960
Um, crystal Leah, I'm a fan. Uh,

1656
01:36:09,020 --> 01:36:13,640
you probably already know him. Um,
Brian Callan is actually overrated.

1657
01:36:13,641 --> 01:36:14,474
I would say.

1658
01:36:15,670 --> 01:36:16,503
Um,

1659
01:36:17,160 --> 01:36:21,650
this is where retractable
claws to eviscerate our friend.

1660
01:36:22,130 --> 01:36:27,040
And you're like, I know. He's our friends.
That's why I'm going to humiliate him.

1661
01:36:28,300 --> 01:36:31,720
I'm Neal Brennan cocreated, the
Chappelle show with Dave Chappelle had,

1662
01:36:31,721 --> 01:36:34,620
has now started doing stand
up and it's super, um,

1663
01:36:35,410 --> 01:36:37,660
incisive and funny,
uh,

1664
01:36:38,530 --> 01:36:42,760
commentary on race and gender that very
few white people can get away with.

1665
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:47,460
Yes. That's hard to get away. He's
very hard to get away with a win.

1666
01:36:47,860 --> 01:36:49,630
Especially if you look like
me. American history. Yeah.

1667
01:36:51,140 --> 01:36:55,770
You're kind of asking for very
unfavorable media covering American.

1668
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,330
Go buy it. Well, you know,

1669
01:36:57,380 --> 01:37:00,860
I'll take it that it must be because
my skin is so luscious and well, yeah,

1670
01:37:00,861 --> 01:37:04,550
I mean between your skin and my skin. I
mean we are, we need to turn the AC on.

1671
01:37:05,740 --> 01:37:09,590
I want to,
so I will come back to the equine therapy,

1672
01:37:09,950 --> 01:37:14,570
but before we get there, I want to come
back to the eight week training program.

1673
01:37:14,940 --> 01:37:19,720
Right. So for your friend? For
my friend Jim, Sarah's, uh,

1674
01:37:20,300 --> 01:37:22,070
I,
because for instance,

1675
01:37:22,071 --> 01:37:24,650
and I think I'm probably not the
only person with this insecurity,

1676
01:37:24,651 --> 01:37:29,060
but I don't feel like a
very funny person and,

1677
01:37:29,400 --> 01:37:31,220
and I worry about,
so for instance,

1678
01:37:31,221 --> 01:37:36,221
there are certain circumstances that
literally like maybe three where I'm like,

1679
01:37:38,570 --> 01:37:41,120
someday if I ever do stand up,
this could be funny.

1680
01:37:41,121 --> 01:37:44,480
But there are so few of them that I'm
like, wow, I would be, I would just get,

1681
01:37:44,660 --> 01:37:45,500
I'd be roadkill.

1682
01:37:45,630 --> 01:37:49,370
We tried to go up for five minutes and
actually one of them earlier before we

1683
01:37:49,371 --> 01:37:51,680
started recording, you came out of the
bathroom and you're like, I just want to,

1684
01:37:52,420 --> 01:37:56,970
I did not create the mess in there. Uh,
and so, you know, my thing has been like,

1685
01:37:56,971 --> 01:38:00,870
what do you do when you like walk into
the bathroom and some like bashful person

1686
01:38:00,871 --> 01:38:03,480
comes out and the next scurries away
and then you walk in, you're like,

1687
01:38:03,720 --> 01:38:05,610
this is a fucking disaster.
But like,

1688
01:38:05,611 --> 01:38:09,120
I'm in an airplane and somebody is
behind me. I fucking clean it up.

1689
01:38:09,121 --> 01:38:12,180
Or do I leave it? Like, I'm not
going to have a conversation
after it. Right, right.

1690
01:38:12,181 --> 01:38:15,060
But I only have like two or three of
those over several decades of being on the

1691
01:38:15,061 --> 01:38:18,930
planet. Right. How do you come
up with, here's the good news.

1692
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:21,170
Yeah. She'll love is it's a muscle. Okay.

1693
01:38:21,470 --> 01:38:23,390
So the more you work at
the stronger I guess,

1694
01:38:23,391 --> 01:38:26,870
and then you'll be like me and you'll
be haunted by everything you look at.

1695
01:38:26,871 --> 01:38:28,790
All you can think of is how
to make it a joke. You know,

1696
01:38:28,791 --> 01:38:32,990
it starts being more and more and then
you're up at night and like you're having

1697
01:38:32,991 --> 01:38:35,060
sex with someone and you're like, oh, this
would be a good joke. And you're like,

1698
01:38:35,061 --> 01:38:37,670
oh my God, can I just get
a second? Anatomies yeah.

1699
01:38:37,671 --> 01:38:41,450
So it starts becoming like pretty
relentless. But yeah, it's a muscle.

1700
01:38:41,451 --> 01:38:43,620
Like any muscle, you know, the first
couple of weeks you go to the gym,

1701
01:38:43,621 --> 01:38:44,454
you're going to be a little sore.

1702
01:38:44,840 --> 01:38:47,240
So what is the, if it's the
muscle, if it's a muscle,

1703
01:38:47,241 --> 01:38:49,760
what is the workout look like?
What are potential exercise

1704
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:53,600
to potential exercises is, um, you know,
I remember like when I first started,

1705
01:38:53,601 --> 01:38:55,180
I would like go around my
house and be like, Trashcan,

1706
01:38:55,190 --> 01:38:58,610
what's funny about a trash
can? Like what's I think
the best way to do it is to,

1707
01:38:58,640 --> 01:39:02,870
which is also helps to, um,
what's the word? Uh, uh,

1708
01:39:02,900 --> 01:39:06,810
when you, um, when you, I'm making weird

1709
01:39:07,160 --> 01:39:11,170
yeah. Model you're making,
you're making hand gestures.

1710
01:39:11,171 --> 01:39:12,940
It looks like a squid

1711
01:39:16,040 --> 01:39:16,873
called debate.

1712
01:39:17,080 --> 01:39:19,960
When you cultivate your voice,
figure out what interests you.

1713
01:39:19,961 --> 01:39:23,980
So what I would first do is figure
out what pisses you off so people's

1714
01:39:23,981 --> 01:39:27,790
limitations piss you off the airport.
Bathrooms piss you off.

1715
01:39:27,791 --> 01:39:29,020
What pisses you off?

1716
01:39:29,021 --> 01:39:33,550
Because I always say comedy is for
the most part just an obsession with

1717
01:39:33,551 --> 01:39:38,230
injustice. So most comedians have a
very deep obsession with injustice.

1718
01:39:38,260 --> 01:39:42,160
This isn't fair. And that's what
we get on stage and talk eight,

1719
01:39:42,161 --> 01:39:44,680
unless you're Demitri Martin and Mitch
Hedberg and you're sort of doing those

1720
01:39:45,430 --> 01:39:50,140
sort of one liner, a sort of
more playful, surreal jokes.

1721
01:39:50,460 --> 01:39:53,140
Um, so what pisses you off?
And you know, Louis Ck says,

1722
01:39:53,141 --> 01:39:54,880
if you think about something
more than three times a week,

1723
01:39:54,881 --> 01:39:58,870
you have to write about it. What's, yeah,
what's haunting you? What's plaguing you?

1724
01:39:58,871 --> 01:39:59,890
What's pissing you off?

1725
01:39:59,891 --> 01:40:03,790
What do you spend most of your
time thinking about anyway? So,

1726
01:40:04,450 --> 01:40:05,590
um,
you know,

1727
01:40:06,250 --> 01:40:11,250
you can't stand your ex boyfriend and
you are ex girlfriend and she's posting

1728
01:40:11,501 --> 01:40:13,900
photos on Facebook and
anything that pisses you off

1729
01:40:13,980 --> 01:40:17,980
just cause I was on grinder grind, me
and I have a boyfriend. Let's be clear.

1730
01:40:17,981 --> 01:40:22,080
There you go. Whatever. I
know you're not monogamous.

1731
01:40:22,081 --> 01:40:25,860
That's what they say on the message
boards. Schreiner um, I did some research,

1732
01:40:27,030 --> 01:40:28,890
so it's actually,
whereas

1733
01:40:29,350 --> 01:40:33,040
most, and it's interesting, I
remember it, you or listen to a,

1734
01:40:33,041 --> 01:40:36,730
one of your podcasts episodes where you
were talking about negative thinking.

1735
01:40:37,410 --> 01:40:39,850
There's positive thinking,
but then the uh,

1736
01:40:40,130 --> 01:40:42,550
I'm going to botch it and
plagiarize it horribly.

1737
01:40:42,551 --> 01:40:45,820
But the power of negative
thinking to prevent or something,

1738
01:40:46,060 --> 01:40:50,080
it's almost like common pursing the
worst case scenarios to avoid them,

1739
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:51,520
which is so cool to me.

1740
01:40:51,521 --> 01:40:55,420
So I always say that comedy is like a
very delicate combination of positive

1741
01:40:55,421 --> 01:40:58,780
thinking and incredibly negative
thinking because you know,

1742
01:40:58,781 --> 01:41:03,781
you take the toilet thing and then you
times that times a million and you go to

1743
01:41:03,821 --> 01:41:06,820
it's worst extreme of what's the worst
possible thing that could happen,

1744
01:41:07,120 --> 01:41:10,330
the catastrophe. And then you
make it a joke. So I, you know,

1745
01:41:10,331 --> 01:41:14,920
you mentioned Louis C K I feel like he
has gotten a lot better at infusing the

1746
01:41:14,921 --> 01:41:17,860
positive. Uh, and I, again, I'm not,

1747
01:41:17,950 --> 01:41:22,670
this is just going from some of, uh, some
of his albums, which are still very fun.

1748
01:41:23,200 --> 01:41:25,810
But then getting on say a late
night show and talking about like,

1749
01:41:25,990 --> 01:41:29,920
everything's awesome and nobody, nobody's
happening the Wifi on the airplanes.

1750
01:41:29,940 --> 01:41:31,330
Yeah. Well he's also, I mean,

1751
01:41:31,331 --> 01:41:35,140
it's interesting because comedians are
also human beings who grow and change. So,

1752
01:41:35,141 --> 01:41:37,690
you know, a lot of people say you
about Howard Stern in the 90s.

1753
01:41:37,691 --> 01:41:40,330
He was much angrier because he was in
a bad marriage and now he's in a great

1754
01:41:40,331 --> 01:41:43,300
marriage and he's much happier,
you know, so it's also, you know,

1755
01:41:43,330 --> 01:41:46,240
I think you have to be very flexible
in your standup. So my first hour,

1756
01:41:46,241 --> 01:41:50,410
I mean I was 26 or something, so I
wasn't even a person yet. But, uh,

1757
01:41:50,411 --> 01:41:53,340
I was very like, I thought it was
right about everything. And you know,

1758
01:41:53,341 --> 01:41:55,660
in your twenties you think you
know everything and you know,

1759
01:41:55,661 --> 01:41:58,750
I was like loud and you know,
um,

1760
01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:02,080
and then my second special I had sort of
life had kicked my ass a little bit and

1761
01:42:02,081 --> 01:42:05,470
I was more humble and I was more
like, I don't know anything, you know,

1762
01:42:05,471 --> 01:42:09,060
my neck specialists sort of in and even
more so all of my specials are just,

1763
01:42:09,061 --> 01:42:13,990
so it's a different person in each
one, you know. So, um, you know,

1764
01:42:13,991 --> 01:42:18,991
Louis C K I think now that he's gotten
so successful and so exalted in lauded,

1765
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:24,910
it's like he's almost like, you know,
just a different guy who was 10 years ago.

1766
01:42:24,940 --> 01:42:27,550
Yeah. He has less anger and he's able
to come from a different perspective.

1767
01:42:27,551 --> 01:42:31,210
So I also think it's important to not
become a parody of yourself and to be able

1768
01:42:31,211 --> 01:42:35,330
to be flexible. Yeah. Yeah. Well that's
why when people ask me, for instance, uh,

1769
01:42:35,750 --> 01:42:40,180
how would you edit your
first book? [inaudible] uh,
if you went back to edit it.

1770
01:42:40,270 --> 01:42:40,520
Yeah.

1771
01:42:40,520 --> 01:42:43,300
This has come up because the
10th anniversary is coming
up in about two years.

1772
01:42:43,720 --> 01:42:46,090
And my answer is almost always,

1773
01:42:46,091 --> 01:42:51,091
I wouldn't edit much because I wrote it
when I was 29 and I was in a different

1774
01:42:51,551 --> 01:42:54,400
place in my perspectives
have shifted. Yeah. Yeah.

1775
01:42:54,610 --> 01:42:59,610
But that book strikes a chord with a lot
of people who are facing similar thanks

1776
01:42:59,741 --> 01:43:04,210
to, I tried to rewrite it now I don't
have the kind of boots on the ground

1777
01:43:04,990 --> 01:43:07,840
experience with those issues right
now to the extent that I did then.

1778
01:43:07,841 --> 01:43:09,240
And I would fuck it up.
Right, right, right, right.

1779
01:43:09,250 --> 01:43:14,170
I would rob it of that kind of immediate
relevance. Um, that's interesting. What,

1780
01:43:14,260 --> 01:43:15,093
uh,

1781
01:43:17,480 --> 01:43:22,130
what would you do night of? So
eight weeks past? Yep. Okay.

1782
01:43:22,160 --> 01:43:24,980
All right. Got a crowd, not just your mom,

1783
01:43:25,100 --> 01:43:27,470
not just your friend or the novice.

1784
01:43:27,500 --> 01:43:30,200
This is for the novice you've taken
from ground zero over eight weeks.

1785
01:43:31,610 --> 01:43:35,210
But just so you know, over the eight
weeks, I'm having them go up every night,

1786
01:43:35,360 --> 01:43:39,050
whether they're bombing or not. Three
spots a night, at least three spots

1787
01:43:40,930 --> 01:43:44,360
on stage. Three times you're
driving to three different things.

1788
01:43:44,930 --> 01:43:47,960
Three different clubs. You're
driving to a club, to a coffee house,

1789
01:43:47,961 --> 01:43:48,800
to a bowling alley.

1790
01:43:48,950 --> 01:43:52,190
When I first started for the first
three years was doing bowling alleys,

1791
01:43:52,490 --> 01:43:55,480
parking lots, uh, Sushi restaurants,

1792
01:43:57,960 --> 01:44:00,180
just ambush a,

1793
01:44:00,190 --> 01:44:05,000
what is that with these Audis?

1794
01:44:05,060 --> 01:44:08,600
Probably easier to get it for you to get
away with the drunk guys lie. Oh Hey,

1795
01:44:08,601 --> 01:44:12,830
I shanked a couple times they got
amazed. Um, but no, in La, I mean,

1796
01:44:12,831 --> 01:44:17,030
and this was the time of my space.
So it was a time when there was all these,

1797
01:44:17,200 --> 01:44:17,510
you know,

1798
01:44:17,510 --> 01:44:21,380
shows at restaurants and bowling alleys
and laundromats and people would just do

1799
01:44:21,381 --> 01:44:24,410
these sorts of shows everywhere.
And I would say, can I get on?

1800
01:44:24,411 --> 01:44:27,380
And you just had to constantly hustle and
you're my spacing all day to get spots

1801
01:44:27,381 --> 01:44:30,530
and then driving around all day,
all night to do them, you know,

1802
01:44:30,531 --> 01:44:33,140
sometimes three minutes,
sometimes whatever. And uh,

1803
01:44:33,141 --> 01:44:36,410
your first minute is going to make or
break you for the most part if you're

1804
01:44:36,411 --> 01:44:37,244
doing a short set.

1805
01:44:37,490 --> 01:44:41,690
So doing three minutes set
is enough practice cause
that first minute is the key

1806
01:44:41,691 --> 01:44:44,000
because as soon as you get,
it's like a first impression of anything.

1807
01:44:44,330 --> 01:44:46,880
If you get onstage and you
have power and you have status,

1808
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:48,740
it doesn't really matter after that.

1809
01:44:48,770 --> 01:44:53,000
But if you go on stage apologetic
and scared and codependent, yeah.

1810
01:44:53,960 --> 01:44:57,290
Even the best materials and Obama.
Yeah. So I say that first minute,

1811
01:44:57,291 --> 01:45:00,850
it's kind of what counts
the most. So, um, so, uh,

1812
01:45:00,920 --> 01:45:04,670
doing three spots a night for eight weeks
and recording your sets and listening

1813
01:45:04,671 --> 01:45:07,790
to them, uh, not only to sort
of get it into your memory,

1814
01:45:07,791 --> 01:45:09,370
but also to see what's
really getting laughs.

1815
01:45:09,371 --> 01:45:11,200
Sometimes we hear that we're bombing,

1816
01:45:11,300 --> 01:45:13,970
we're actually getting laughs
or we hear the lots are smaller.

1817
01:45:13,971 --> 01:45:15,470
It's just important to listen to it back.

1818
01:45:15,530 --> 01:45:19,760
You're actively later when you're not
sort of in the sort of deer in the

1819
01:45:19,761 --> 01:45:22,310
headlights. Yes. And um,

1820
01:45:23,150 --> 01:45:26,960
and then the day of when I do an hour
at night or when I do two hours a night,

1821
01:45:26,961 --> 01:45:28,910
when I'm doing,
I'm getting ready for my hour.

1822
01:45:28,911 --> 01:45:32,390
I don't leave my hotel room and I
don't talk all day, which is like,

1823
01:45:32,391 --> 01:45:33,980
I try not to talk on the phone.

1824
01:45:33,981 --> 01:45:37,490
I try not to just deplete too much of my
energy so that I'm super excited to get

1825
01:45:37,491 --> 01:45:40,430
on stage and talk so that
I almost am like, uh,

1826
01:45:41,060 --> 01:45:45,440
what would the metaphor be
like? Um, a boiling pot?

1827
01:45:45,990 --> 01:45:50,510
No. Of Balloon? No, I'm not sure what
you're going to be either of those.

1828
01:45:50,511 --> 01:45:54,030
Depends what comes up. I mean like when
you're like chomping at the bit. Yeah.

1829
01:45:54,050 --> 01:45:56,060
You know,
I kind of deprive myself.

1830
01:45:56,061 --> 01:45:58,640
It's almost like starving
yourself before meal. You know?

1831
01:45:58,670 --> 01:46:01,430
Like I kinda like sit in my hotel
room all day. I just do work.

1832
01:46:01,670 --> 01:46:05,900
I don't talk on the phone so that I'm
super amped to talk. So I would say like,

1833
01:46:05,901 --> 01:46:10,520
don't go out to dinner first. Don't
go to lunch, hang out, watch TV. Yes.

1834
01:46:11,090 --> 01:46:13,870
Exactly. Deprive yourself. So
by the time you get onstage,

1835
01:46:13,900 --> 01:46:18,330
you're just like super connected and
human connection you have all day. Yes.

1836
01:46:18,680 --> 01:46:21,790
Craving intimacy, you
know, instead of shutdown.

1837
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:26,210
And you've already filled your,
um, quota for connection all day.

1838
01:46:26,600 --> 01:46:31,080
And when do you know that your material
is ready for three minutes set?

1839
01:46:31,730 --> 01:46:35,900
In other words,
someone that hasn't even done the,

1840
01:46:35,901 --> 01:46:39,170
what's funny about a garbage can. Yeah.
Like we're talking, it's like RF Ferris,

1841
01:46:39,171 --> 01:46:43,760
you're on in an hour. Do I get up and
do, what the fuck do I talk about? Well,

1842
01:46:43,761 --> 01:46:47,630
here's the thing. You're already,
you're already naturally funny,

1843
01:46:47,870 --> 01:46:51,810
so you're and you're smarts, so you're
going to be fine because you're going to,

1844
01:46:52,230 --> 01:46:56,590
I mean, uh, um, pending any, uh,

1845
01:46:57,120 --> 01:46:58,980
anxiety attacks.

1846
01:47:02,670 --> 01:47:05,460
I think I'm the only funny one. I'm
not trying to be fun. Here's the thing,

1847
01:47:05,461 --> 01:47:08,400
I feel like you are a public
speaker naturally. I mean,
you're very good at this.

1848
01:47:08,401 --> 01:47:11,980
Like, I mean in front of a crowd, I mean,
you're not gonna have a problem. Um,

1849
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:15,090
and you're going to react to the situation
and be honest and self deprecate and

1850
01:47:15,091 --> 01:47:16,620
whatever or like,
um,

1851
01:47:17,070 --> 01:47:21,240
but I think the only time you really get
in trouble is when you attach yourself

1852
01:47:21,241 --> 01:47:24,480
to a script and are flexible,
right? So if you're like,

1853
01:47:24,720 --> 01:47:28,500
go off on a thing of, Oh, you know who I
am, you read my, if someone heckles you,

1854
01:47:28,501 --> 01:47:30,330
I've read your book and now you're right.
And then you're like,

1855
01:47:30,570 --> 01:47:32,190
so I was at the supermarket today.

1856
01:47:32,191 --> 01:47:36,300
And if you can't respond
in a conversational,

1857
01:47:36,301 --> 01:47:40,460
present way, it's like boxing. Yep.
Like if someone throws some new,

1858
01:47:40,470 --> 01:47:42,510
you got to change your
combination or whatever it is.

1859
01:47:43,200 --> 01:47:47,880
You have to be relentlessly present.
And flexible and detached from your plan.

1860
01:47:48,300 --> 01:47:51,270
So it's make a plan and
then be ready to completely

1861
01:47:52,890 --> 01:47:57,630
adaptive, adaptive needed with
the your essay two hours a night.

1862
01:47:57,840 --> 01:48:02,570
Yeah. Right. Let's see. You're getting
now you're getting ready. Do that. And uh,

1863
01:48:02,640 --> 01:48:04,890
well two I guess two
very related questions.

1864
01:48:04,891 --> 01:48:08,430
So you have the two hours a night in
preparation for like recording the big

1865
01:48:08,431 --> 01:48:09,990
special yes. Is that right? Yes.

1866
01:48:10,050 --> 01:48:12,840
Then you have like the night of
recording the big special yes.

1867
01:48:12,870 --> 01:48:15,150
What are your pregame rituals look like?
Love it.

1868
01:48:15,210 --> 01:48:18,630
Like in the two hours before each
of those? Yeah. What happened?

1869
01:48:18,690 --> 01:48:20,370
So in the two hour,
okay.

1870
01:48:20,371 --> 01:48:24,210
So I am right now I'm touring
to get ready for my HBO special,

1871
01:48:24,211 --> 01:48:28,070
which I'm shooting in August. So every
other weekend I'm on the road. Uh,

1872
01:48:28,110 --> 01:48:29,940
in clubs I like to a performance,

1873
01:48:29,941 --> 01:48:34,530
small spaces to really ascertain if
things are working and seeing people's

1874
01:48:34,531 --> 01:48:38,160
faces. Like, cause you can, in a
theater you can get an applause break,

1875
01:48:38,430 --> 01:48:41,730
but when you're up close and you
see someone you can't fake laughter,

1876
01:48:41,731 --> 01:48:43,120
you can't fake it, bottle
it. Imagine if you have

1877
01:48:43,240 --> 01:48:47,590
30 people, if you have 200 people,
10 people clap really loudly,

1878
01:48:47,591 --> 01:48:49,780
you think you're killing it.
Whereas if you have 30 people in,

1879
01:48:49,781 --> 01:48:51,130
one person clapped yet.
Oh Shit.

1880
01:48:51,270 --> 01:48:53,220
Yeah, exactly. So, but
if you get a theater,

1881
01:48:53,221 --> 01:48:56,970
you get sort of this false sense of
bravado and false sense of success.

1882
01:48:56,971 --> 01:48:58,350
Whereas like when you're in a club,

1883
01:48:58,351 --> 01:49:00,960
like people are drinking and
they're eating at, you know,

1884
01:49:00,961 --> 01:49:05,190
it's like you're up against more.
So I like to practice in clubs and uh,

1885
01:49:05,550 --> 01:49:09,660
and so when the day actually
comes, I will, I have two dogs.

1886
01:49:09,661 --> 01:49:13,660
I will send them with the dog people
so that they're not in the house, um,

1887
01:49:13,710 --> 01:49:16,830
for those two days because they'll wake
me up early or the whole, you know,

1888
01:49:16,831 --> 01:49:21,420
whatever. Um, even though they provide
me with a lot of emotional support, um,

1889
01:49:21,450 --> 01:49:26,370
just avoiding any curve balls. Um, and
I'll wake up, I'll do my normal routine.

1890
01:49:26,460 --> 01:49:30,420
I'll probably,
I'll listen to the set a couple times,

1891
01:49:30,900 --> 01:49:34,320
even though I know it inside and out,
just more, because I know I'm neurotic.

1892
01:49:34,590 --> 01:49:36,270
So this is a previous performance.

1893
01:49:36,310 --> 01:49:40,440
I'd like the hour that I'm planning
on doing essentially like the script.

1894
01:49:40,530 --> 01:49:43,500
It's like going over a script.
I have it recorded and I'll go for a run,

1895
01:49:43,501 --> 01:49:45,900
probably got it.
And with it in my year,

1896
01:49:46,060 --> 01:49:49,780
the recording is you reading the script
or according as an actual performance.

1897
01:49:49,810 --> 01:49:50,071
I got it.

1898
01:49:50,071 --> 01:49:53,770
So I'll record all of my hours when
I'm in the clubs on a voice memo on my

1899
01:49:53,771 --> 01:49:58,360
iPhone and then I'll label them. This
was good at this point. This, you know,

1900
01:49:58,361 --> 01:50:02,080
I did this new chunk of this. I'll be
really specific about which one is which.

1901
01:50:02,350 --> 01:50:04,570
The one that I feel should
be the one that's recorded.

1902
01:50:04,840 --> 01:50:08,980
I will go for a run and
listen to it in my I Pod Pad,

1903
01:50:09,390 --> 01:50:14,110
pad phone, Samsung, sidekick, Atari,

1904
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:19,870
just a five phones page or
pager, sky, pager. And then um,

1905
01:50:20,650 --> 01:50:25,540
I'll kind of lie in bed. I'll take a nap,
I'll eat. Uh, and that's pretty much it.

1906
01:50:25,870 --> 01:50:26,140
Got It.

1907
01:50:26,140 --> 01:50:29,620
And then I have to get there at four for
hair and makeup and I'll meditate twice,

1908
01:50:29,890 --> 01:50:33,010
20 minutes in the morning, 20 minutes
before the show, like trends and all that.

1909
01:50:33,960 --> 01:50:37,370
You got your mantra, mantra? Yeah.
Don't tell anyone. Help me. Joe Public.

1910
01:50:38,590 --> 01:50:40,060
Oh my God,
I can't believe we're sitting outside

1911
01:50:43,690 --> 01:50:46,960
and, uh, really, um,

1912
01:50:48,070 --> 01:50:50,430
very economical with my energy,
the death.

1913
01:50:50,590 --> 01:50:55,120
And so you've got the,
let's just say the warmup acts new.

1914
01:50:55,121 --> 01:50:57,310
That's probably not, that's
probably not a polite way to say it,

1915
01:50:57,340 --> 01:51:02,110
but the opening scene, mark got
the openers. You know, you're,

1916
01:51:02,200 --> 01:51:06,040
you've got 15 minutes to go time. Yeah.
What do you do in those 15 minutes?

1917
01:51:07,980 --> 01:51:11,010
That's a good question.
Uh,

1918
01:51:11,250 --> 01:51:16,250
I'm usually managing a or
practicing wardrobe malfunctions.

1919
01:51:17,580 --> 01:51:21,000
So practicing like Janet
Jackson nipple exposure. Yeah.

1920
01:51:21,001 --> 01:51:25,980
I'll walk through sort of my most extreme
movements with my wardrobe, right.

1921
01:51:25,981 --> 01:51:29,850
To make sure you know, like, you know what
I mean? Uh, it's uh, what's it called?

1922
01:51:29,851 --> 01:51:34,290
Like, um, catastrophe, a troubleshooting.
Yeah. Actually, you know,

1923
01:51:34,680 --> 01:51:38,360
um, I'll just close my eyes and meditates.
Troubleshooting other residents.

1924
01:51:38,370 --> 01:51:40,340
Catastrophe sniping. Yeah.
I took what I could touch.

1925
01:51:40,350 --> 01:51:42,210
The reason I think I like that.
Um,

1926
01:51:42,720 --> 01:51:47,310
and then sometimes something super
normal because I think I'm, you know,

1927
01:51:47,730 --> 01:51:49,440
I'm a strong believer in this.
Everybody is,

1928
01:51:49,441 --> 01:51:53,310
I'm not special cause I believe proven
science, but it's very Pavlovian.

1929
01:51:53,340 --> 01:51:56,010
So it's like all of a sudden I'm doing
something I've never done before before a

1930
01:51:56,011 --> 01:51:57,480
show,
then it's gonna feel weird.

1931
01:51:57,481 --> 01:52:00,270
So before I go on stage at the comedy
store tonight, on any given night,

1932
01:52:00,271 --> 01:52:03,930
I'm looking at Instagram,
I'm on Twitter, I'm texting,

1933
01:52:03,931 --> 01:52:05,130
so I'll do something just kind of,

1934
01:52:05,160 --> 01:52:08,640
that I always do before I
go on stage because if you
put too much pressure on it,

1935
01:52:08,641 --> 01:52:10,100
like this is a different show.
Your,

1936
01:52:10,110 --> 01:52:12,570
I'm doing the same thing I've been doing
the last four months. Right, right, right.

1937
01:52:12,600 --> 01:52:16,470
You know what I mean? And it's like, it's
basically my, my work isn't done tonight.

1938
01:52:16,471 --> 01:52:17,670
My work was done three months ago.

1939
01:52:18,520 --> 01:52:23,410
Right, right. I just have to show up.
Yeah. I had, um, conversation with,

1940
01:52:23,440 --> 01:52:26,800
uh, with, uh, Paul Levesque
of residents, triple h,

1941
01:52:26,801 --> 01:52:29,710
the professional wrestler who was on his
podcast and he was telling me a story,

1942
01:52:30,220 --> 01:52:34,600
uh, why am I blanking here? He just fought
Manny Pacquiao or Floyd Mayweather Jr.

1943
01:52:34,601 --> 01:52:38,260
Yeah. And he was saying, he was
telling me a story about how he,

1944
01:52:38,380 --> 01:52:42,040
he visited Floyd in his dressing
or right before a huge fight.

1945
01:52:42,070 --> 01:52:44,240
And he was just sitting there watching TV
and he's like, oh yeah, sit down. Like,

1946
01:52:44,241 --> 01:52:46,010
let's have a conversation. And then
Paul's like, I don't want to bother

1947
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:49,600
you. Like, I don't want you to get
knocked out of the zone and blah, blah,

1948
01:52:49,610 --> 01:52:51,920
aren't you nervous? And he's like, what
good is being nervous is going to do me.

1949
01:52:51,921 --> 01:52:53,150
It's like,
if I'm not ready now,

1950
01:52:53,790 --> 01:52:58,150
yeah, hundred percent. So it's like, if
I need to do some weird ritual right now,

1951
01:52:58,151 --> 01:53:01,720
then I'm the, I big got bigger problems.
Yeah. You know? So I think for me,

1952
01:53:01,721 --> 01:53:04,930
just keeping it very simple and, um,
you know, if I'm shooting a special,

1953
01:53:04,931 --> 01:53:08,950
my mom and dad or they have
to come different nights,
but, um, we'll come salt,

1954
01:53:08,980 --> 01:53:12,780
like take a picture for that or
something that just feels benevolent and,

1955
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:15,220
and connected. And I, you know,

1956
01:53:15,221 --> 01:53:19,000
I'm very dorky about gratitude and I'll
just be grateful and I'll thank the crew

1957
01:53:19,001 --> 01:53:22,720
and I'll talk to my director and just
say thank you and like just really do

1958
01:53:22,721 --> 01:53:25,240
whatever I have to do to go out there
and just like, have a good time.

1959
01:53:25,300 --> 01:53:28,750
I'm not taking myself seriously.
I'm not stressed, I'm not in a zone.

1960
01:53:28,751 --> 01:53:31,810
It's like I know this backwards
and forwards at this point.

1961
01:53:31,811 --> 01:53:35,410
So the only work I have to do
is just be relentlessly present.

1962
01:53:35,411 --> 01:53:39,280
And this sounds so Geeky, but I truly
have to have a good time. Yeah. Um,

1963
01:53:39,550 --> 01:53:41,860
because my work is already
done. Right. You know,

1964
01:53:41,861 --> 01:53:46,240
that's kind of the misery of standup
and the joy of standup is that the,

1965
01:53:46,270 --> 01:53:49,000
when you're actually shooting it on TV,
you're just showing off at that point.

1966
01:53:49,240 --> 01:53:52,360
There's no, you're not in the trenches.
Yeah. You know, everything works.

1967
01:53:52,361 --> 01:53:55,770
You've done it. I, anything
I do on showing that I've
done a hundred times. Right.

1968
01:53:55,810 --> 01:53:56,830
And I know it works

1969
01:53:56,950 --> 01:53:59,790
well. That's part of the reason I
love watching and I've seen, you know,

1970
01:53:59,800 --> 01:54:03,640
Brian do this, but work on
material. Yeah. When it's not 100%.

1971
01:54:03,680 --> 01:54:08,360
Yeah, I find that fascinating. It's pretty
cool. Yeah, it's really, there is a,

1972
01:54:08,720 --> 01:54:10,620
if you're a comedy nerd in any way,
uh,

1973
01:54:10,700 --> 01:54:14,300
Kevin Nealon does a show at the laugh
factory on Tuesday nights and it's new

1974
01:54:14,301 --> 01:54:17,960
material night. This is in loss of
in Los Angeles. Yes. So, um, and I,

1975
01:54:18,020 --> 01:54:21,170
but I think they put videos on the laugh
factory website or something and it's

1976
01:54:21,171 --> 01:54:22,220
Comedians,
you know,

1977
01:54:22,221 --> 01:54:26,060
big comedians who are only allowed to
do new material and we will call each

1978
01:54:26,061 --> 01:54:28,970
other out if I'm like, dude, I know
you've been doing that joke and I know,

1979
01:54:28,971 --> 01:54:29,541
you know,
you know,

1980
01:54:29,541 --> 01:54:32,780
cause we really try to be vulnerable and
go up and do sort of fresh premises and

1981
01:54:32,781 --> 01:54:35,000
then some of us are bombing and you know,

1982
01:54:35,001 --> 01:54:39,480
we're really struggling and it's like
being a beginner open miker again.

1983
01:54:39,980 --> 01:54:44,480
Have you seen the documentary, the
comedian Jerry Seinfeld and Warnie? Yes.

1984
01:54:44,510 --> 01:54:46,190
What is,
how do you feel about [inaudible]

1985
01:54:46,530 --> 01:54:51,360
I love it. I love it. I love Jerry.
I think his work ethic is really,

1986
01:54:51,370 --> 01:54:53,340
um, he just kind of nailed it. I mean,

1987
01:54:53,341 --> 01:54:55,050
you know about this more
than anyone obviously,

1988
01:54:55,051 --> 01:54:58,440
but his whole thing is just do the
work. It's, yeah, there's no shortcuts.

1989
01:54:58,441 --> 01:55:00,650
There's no, um, you know,

1990
01:55:00,660 --> 01:55:03,390
there's a linear relationship and stand
up of how much you do it and how good

1991
01:55:03,391 --> 01:55:08,220
you are. It's super simple,
very merit driven. Um,

1992
01:55:08,280 --> 01:55:11,460
and so I like that.
I like his methodical approach.

1993
01:55:11,820 --> 01:55:15,510
I've learned a lot from him and been
inspired by that. And he's also, you know,

1994
01:55:15,570 --> 01:55:20,340
I think it's good to glamorize health
cause I think in stand up especially,

1995
01:55:20,580 --> 01:55:25,020
um, uh, drug addiction and alcoholism
is so glamorized, you know,

1996
01:55:25,021 --> 01:55:25,920
in Jerry's Kinda,

1997
01:55:25,921 --> 01:55:30,900
he does yoga and drink smoothies and
he's doesn't drink on stage. You know,

1998
01:55:30,901 --> 01:55:32,850
he takes it very seriously,
stand up as a job.

1999
01:55:32,850 --> 01:55:35,810
And I think a lot of people
see it more as a hobby. Um,

2000
01:55:35,850 --> 01:55:38,940
cause we all really just secretly want
to be rock stars but aren't cool enough.

2001
01:55:39,240 --> 01:55:40,290
Um,
but you know,

2002
01:55:40,291 --> 01:55:43,470
I think there was this generation of
comedians obviously in the 70s, 80s,

2003
01:55:43,471 --> 01:55:48,030
who were all on coke and hookers and now
I think the pendulum has kind of swung,

2004
01:55:48,031 --> 01:55:52,350
everyone's like in therapy. And Drinks
Jamba juice and things like vegan.

2005
01:55:52,620 --> 01:55:55,590
And I think that Jerry in
that documentary sort of him

2006
01:55:57,330 --> 01:55:59,640
admitting how seriously he takes it.
Yeah.

2007
01:55:59,700 --> 01:56:03,610
Like the nerd in the class who gets a
straight A and all the jocks hate like,

2008
01:56:03,690 --> 01:56:06,750
who's a loser. Like it's high school
all over again. Yeah. You know,

2009
01:56:06,751 --> 01:56:10,590
it's like he makes trying look cool.
Yeah. Um, and then Arnie, you know,

2010
01:56:10,591 --> 01:56:15,540
I think it's tricky because he just was
so angry in that documentary and I, I,

2011
01:56:15,780 --> 01:56:19,680
I worry a little bit that people were
like, oh, that's how all comedians are.

2012
01:56:19,740 --> 01:56:20,790
Right.
You know?

2013
01:56:20,791 --> 01:56:24,810
But it's a documentary and if someone
thinks that that's their generalization.

2014
01:56:24,830 --> 01:56:29,430
Yeah. Yeah. But warranty
is very, very funny.

2015
01:56:29,820 --> 01:56:34,800
And I think that that documentary,
um, was a big, uh, what was it?

2016
01:56:34,830 --> 01:56:39,750
What would it be when something
is, um, uh, injury to his career?

2017
01:56:40,050 --> 01:56:42,140
Yeah. Yeah. I think he would have
been really big if it was [inaudible].

2018
01:56:42,650 --> 01:56:45,860
Yeah. That was a fascinating documentary
for those who haven't seen it,

2019
01:56:45,861 --> 01:56:47,420
but it's basically tracking.
Yeah.

2020
01:56:47,720 --> 01:56:52,720
A younger up and coming comedian
with Jerry working on new material.

2021
01:56:52,850 --> 01:56:57,170
Yes. Uh, yes. And a friend's ex
girlfriend actually popped up. Yeah,

2022
01:56:57,171 --> 01:57:00,830
I was watching it with him and he's
like, wait, what is that like? No, no.

2023
01:57:00,831 --> 01:57:03,500
She popped up.
It was just her leading Jerry to the stage

2024
01:57:03,630 --> 01:57:06,090
and he's like, wait a second.
Was that, it's not my girlfriend.

2025
01:57:08,540 --> 01:57:12,610
Yeah. Really bizarre shilling
a twist. Let me ask, um,

2026
01:57:12,770 --> 01:57:15,860
I don't want to chew up
your entire afternoon. Uh,
this is, this is really fun.

2027
01:57:16,010 --> 01:57:20,510
So maybe we'll do round two some time,
but I'd love to ask you a number one.

2028
01:57:21,440 --> 01:57:22,650
Equine therapy.
Yes.

2029
01:57:23,530 --> 01:57:28,520
Well, my therapy, the horse rides you.
Is that when you, how does this work? No,

2030
01:57:28,521 --> 01:57:31,280
that's Ashley Madison. Oh, that's the
how we've been through that. Catherine.

2031
01:57:31,281 --> 01:57:35,870
The Great. Yeah. Right. So, um,
okay. Actually sounded a little much.

2032
01:57:36,330 --> 01:57:38,540
It did not come out the
way I intended it to Sarah.

2033
01:57:38,630 --> 01:57:43,230
That that's my attempt to blue
comedy. And I think, you know,

2034
01:57:44,110 --> 01:57:46,650
a successful a time, so I don't
think you'd have to wait a week.

2035
01:57:47,060 --> 01:57:51,290
You should go on tonight. You can
be my warm up and he makes me angry.

2036
01:57:51,900 --> 01:57:56,330
Horses riding women talk about it. So I, I

2037
01:57:56,560 --> 01:57:59,620
think this might interest you
or interest you because, um,

2038
01:57:59,680 --> 01:58:03,900
and I hope that I do justice to it and
explain it in a educated enough way to

2039
01:58:03,901 --> 01:58:08,260
her. It doesn't sound ridiculous,
but horses are prey animals.

2040
01:58:08,680 --> 01:58:12,500
So they are incredibly attuned to
any kind of threats. I mean it's,

2041
01:58:12,520 --> 01:58:16,000
I mean they're constantly scanning for
threats, which the human brain does also.

2042
01:58:16,001 --> 01:58:19,300
And we try to like pretend it's not,
but essentially,

2043
01:58:19,330 --> 01:58:23,860
I mean constantly they owe a horse can
look at a bobcat and tell if it's hungry

2044
01:58:23,861 --> 01:58:27,550
or not. I mean it's fight or
flight one on one. You know,

2045
01:58:27,551 --> 01:58:30,340
they can literally read
faces they can read. Um,

2046
01:58:30,790 --> 01:58:35,410
so when you are around a horse,
a horse is codependent,

2047
01:58:35,530 --> 01:58:40,180
if you will, uh, looking at you and their
behavior depends on your behavior. Um,

2048
01:58:40,510 --> 01:58:45,510
so essentially what you do in equine
therapy is it's my goal was to practice

2049
01:58:45,521 --> 01:58:50,521
being more direct and clear with my
intention versus what I'm asking someone.

2050
01:58:51,010 --> 01:58:51,940
Cause you know,
a lot of times,

2051
01:58:51,941 --> 01:58:55,420
and you can't see this if you're listening
to this podcast, but I'll say like, um,

2052
01:58:55,840 --> 01:59:00,820
no, I'm fine. I'm not mad. I'm
obviously mad. I mean I don't my face,

2053
01:59:00,821 --> 01:59:03,340
I'm, I'm betraying my
own face. And you know,

2054
01:59:03,341 --> 01:59:07,060
humans tend to be manipulative and passive
aggressive and say one thing and mean

2055
01:59:07,061 --> 01:59:10,740
another thing. And I think
that's something, you know,

2056
01:59:11,170 --> 01:59:14,650
that maybe people in my field maybe do
more than you know, you and what you do.

2057
01:59:14,651 --> 01:59:19,020
You seem very like clear and effective.
Great actor,

2058
01:59:19,080 --> 01:59:23,400
pathological liar, sociopath, American
psycho, American history X. Um,

2059
01:59:23,950 --> 01:59:28,950
but I found that I was really struggling
with not being with saying one thing

2060
01:59:29,201 --> 01:59:34,201
and meaning another thing and being
apologetic and not being present and not

2061
01:59:34,601 --> 01:59:36,580
getting the results out
of people that I wanted.

2062
01:59:36,581 --> 01:59:40,030
There was a great documentary called
Buck. That's about the guy. Yes.

2063
01:59:40,031 --> 01:59:42,160
It's about the guy that
was the horse whisper.

2064
01:59:42,640 --> 01:59:46,960
And essentially the whole premise of the
documentary is that in order to control

2065
01:59:46,961 --> 01:59:48,670
something,
you have to give it more control.

2066
01:59:49,240 --> 01:59:53,530
So in order to get power over someone,
you have to empower them.

2067
01:59:53,531 --> 01:59:58,420
So people bring these problem horses and
they pulling them and trying to control

2068
01:59:58,421 --> 02:00:02,320
them and the first thing he does is
give them more rains and give them the

2069
02:00:02,321 --> 02:00:05,590
opportunity to make the right decision
so you can control something when you

2070
02:00:05,591 --> 02:00:07,780
give them more control.
So that really fascinated me,

2071
02:00:07,781 --> 02:00:11,530
that documentary and the way that he
was able to nonverbally communicate with

2072
02:00:11,531 --> 02:00:15,190
horses because we waste so
much time trying to verbally
communicate with people.

2073
02:00:15,191 --> 02:00:19,790
And a lot of times we just confused them.
And words are so subjective and um,

2074
02:00:20,950 --> 02:00:25,210
we talk way too much so people don't
actually understand what we're saying. Uh,

2075
02:00:25,480 --> 02:00:27,640
you know, I don't know if this has
ever happened to you, but I, you know,

2076
02:00:27,641 --> 02:00:29,590
a lot of times when I'm
writing a script or a TV show,

2077
02:00:29,591 --> 02:00:32,770
I'll get notes from an executive and I'll,
you know,

2078
02:00:32,771 --> 02:00:34,330
I'm sure your editors or whatever,

2079
02:00:34,720 --> 02:00:38,440
I'll be in a meeting for an hour and I'll
walk out and I'm like, I have no idea.

2080
02:00:39,130 --> 02:00:41,620
No idea.
We spoke for an hour.

2081
02:00:42,010 --> 02:00:46,360
I have no clue what my objective is.
I don't know what the notes are.

2082
02:00:46,361 --> 02:00:47,380
I don't know if they liked it,

2083
02:00:47,381 --> 02:00:51,460
like we just bloviate to the point
of just like be talking in circles.

2084
02:00:51,840 --> 02:00:55,960
So, um, I went in, um, uh,

2085
02:00:56,050 --> 02:00:59,260
with the horses, uh, a girlfriend
of mine took me for my birthday.

2086
02:00:59,530 --> 02:01:03,160
And the first thing you do is you
pick a horse and there's four horses.

2087
02:01:03,161 --> 02:01:06,100
They all various degrees
of damage and backgrounds,

2088
02:01:06,101 --> 02:01:08,650
and she tells you about each
one and you choose your horse,

2089
02:01:08,651 --> 02:01:12,730
which already says everything that she
needs to know about you based on the one

2090
02:01:12,731 --> 02:01:14,770
that you choose.
It's like a word shock test or something.

2091
02:01:15,070 --> 02:01:16,360
So that's really interesting.

2092
02:01:16,361 --> 02:01:21,160
And then the first objective is get
the horses from one end to the, uh, uh,

2093
02:01:21,190 --> 02:01:24,160
corral to the other, which is probably
like half of a football field. I mean,

2094
02:01:24,161 --> 02:01:27,220
it's big and you're like,
how am I going to, hello?

2095
02:01:27,250 --> 02:01:31,090
What's the best phone that's
about phone? Um, that's, uh,

2096
02:01:31,780 --> 02:01:36,300
Ashley Madison Customer Service. Uh,
so I'm like, how do you get a heart?

2097
02:01:36,340 --> 02:01:40,520
How do you get horses with no rain from
one end to the other? Right. Right.

2098
02:01:40,521 --> 02:01:44,480
This is crazy. Without controlling
them or hitting them or, uh,

2099
02:01:44,840 --> 02:01:48,740
you can't use treats. I can't use any of
my, I can't use charm. I can't use humor.

2100
02:01:49,090 --> 02:01:52,780
I can't use intelligence. I can't
use any of the things that I rely on,

2101
02:01:52,781 --> 02:01:56,230
on a daily basis to manipulate
and beguile people. Right?

2102
02:01:56,420 --> 02:02:01,420
And so essentially you have to use your
intention so you let them know we're

2103
02:02:02,241 --> 02:02:05,210
going to the other end.
You can use words if you want,

2104
02:02:05,540 --> 02:02:08,630
as long as you're saying something and
meaning it, they're going to buy it.

2105
02:02:08,660 --> 02:02:11,810
If you're going, you know, you can't see
me doing this, but if you're going like,

2106
02:02:11,811 --> 02:02:15,890
I need you to come with me. Is that
okay? If you're asked, there are no,

2107
02:02:16,010 --> 02:02:18,290
there aren't clear. They don't
trust you. You're not in charge.

2108
02:02:18,291 --> 02:02:20,600
You don't have status.
So I go and I'm,

2109
02:02:20,660 --> 02:02:22,070
I'm leading them from
one end to the other.

2110
02:02:22,071 --> 02:02:24,950
They're following me and it's like magic.
They're following me.

2111
02:02:25,160 --> 02:02:27,290
And then halfway through I
start like to see my friend,

2112
02:02:27,300 --> 02:02:30,270
I've got to following me and they
stopped and I was like, Whoa,

2113
02:02:30,290 --> 02:02:31,220
what just happened? She, she's like,

2114
02:02:31,221 --> 02:02:33,830
you lost your connection to them because
you focused on something else. I mean,

2115
02:02:33,831 --> 02:02:38,680
it was just this, like, it was like magic
almost. It was this amazing. So I just,

2116
02:02:38,960 --> 02:02:42,230
it's a way to practice being present
and connected and having a consistent

2117
02:02:42,231 --> 02:02:47,231
intention with essentially these sort of
animals that are basically a mirror to

2118
02:02:47,271 --> 02:02:51,290
your psyche. That's very cool. It's super
cool when they, when you stop focusing,

2119
02:02:51,291 --> 02:02:53,870
they stop focusing and whenever you lie,

2120
02:02:54,200 --> 02:02:56,450
they freeze because they
don't understand why.

2121
02:02:56,451 --> 02:02:58,850
Because they just see
she's mean something,

2122
02:02:58,851 --> 02:03:00,590
but she's saying something
else and they freeze.

2123
02:03:01,100 --> 02:03:04,490
So as soon as you're disingenuous or
pretend you're not scared and you are,

2124
02:03:04,491 --> 02:03:07,700
they just freeze and look at you
like, don't get it. They're just like,

2125
02:03:07,701 --> 02:03:12,440
grow up and you're like, oh, sorry. Let me
be clear. You know, it's this really cool,

2126
02:03:12,441 --> 02:03:17,180
uh, sort of, um, way that I think, and
I'm not saying I'm one of these people,

2127
02:03:17,181 --> 02:03:22,181
but I think that smart people who
have so much therapy and we've so over

2128
02:03:22,461 --> 02:03:26,330
therapize sometimes it's just like,
keep it simple. Bread and butter.

2129
02:03:26,760 --> 02:03:31,370
Another animal in a cage. Yeah. Yes or no.

2130
02:03:31,760 --> 02:03:34,070
It's so primal and simple.

2131
02:03:34,640 --> 02:03:38,870
I've almost learned so much from that
than any other book or therapy I've ever

2132
02:03:38,871 --> 02:03:39,704
done.

2133
02:03:39,860 --> 02:03:42,670
That's a for those people interested in,
uh,

2134
02:03:43,010 --> 02:03:46,990
a lot of this stuff I'm really tempted to,
to experience that.

2135
02:03:47,040 --> 02:03:51,450
It's here, it's in the, the woman that I
go to is out in Topanga and it's awesome.

2136
02:03:51,530 --> 02:03:53,310
Cool. It's called the
reflective horse, you know,

2137
02:03:53,311 --> 02:03:56,900
a lot of rehab patients do equine therapy.
Um,

2138
02:03:57,600 --> 02:04:01,850
while I was going, I was going
to say that, uh, reflective,

2139
02:04:01,860 --> 02:04:05,520
I think it's reflective, reflective
for us, I'm taking notes, uh,

2140
02:04:05,910 --> 02:04:10,910
is temple Grandin worked a lot with
horses early on and that's how she started

2141
02:04:11,401 --> 02:04:15,750
to realize like, wow, I'm actually very
good at understanding what they need,

2142
02:04:15,930 --> 02:04:19,010
what they're afraid of, et
cetera. Um, so fast now,

2143
02:04:19,011 --> 02:04:22,380
and you mentioned book and then you said
therapy. So I'll ask you a question,

2144
02:04:22,590 --> 02:04:26,670
which is, what book or books have
you gifted to other people the most?

2145
02:04:26,860 --> 02:04:29,320
Ooh,
that's a great question.

2146
02:04:30,280 --> 02:04:35,280
I like to pretend that I read
fiction and I just don't.

2147
02:04:36,400 --> 02:04:40,860
Okay. So I went through
this phase of giving people,

2148
02:04:40,861 --> 02:04:44,550
cause I read one fiction book in the
last like three years called Super Sad,

2149
02:04:44,551 --> 02:04:48,780
true love story by Gary Shrank Art,
which is phenomenal. Super Sad,

2150
02:04:48,781 --> 02:04:51,040
true love story.
Gary Sign Guard.

2151
02:04:51,210 --> 02:04:56,070
It's super sad but very
funny and I'm not super,

2152
02:04:56,071 --> 02:04:57,360
it's,
it's um,

2153
02:04:57,690 --> 02:05:02,690
it's like a dystopian satire on the future
and essentially it's like that we all

2154
02:05:03,571 --> 02:05:08,020
have cell phones sort of
embedded in our chest. And um,

2155
02:05:08,070 --> 02:05:11,340
as soon as I see you, I can know
everything about you, your cholesterol,

2156
02:05:11,520 --> 02:05:16,470
your genetics, your dad had a stroke.
Like I can know at your bank account,

2157
02:05:16,471 --> 02:05:18,030
your credit report.

2158
02:05:18,031 --> 02:05:21,330
Like essentially we know everything about
everyone instantaneously and it's just

2159
02:05:21,331 --> 02:05:25,170
very interesting and like could happen.
Uh,

2160
02:05:25,230 --> 02:05:27,150
and I read that because I had to,

2161
02:05:27,210 --> 02:05:31,200
because a friend of mine who's sort of
successful and has everything and had a

2162
02:05:31,201 --> 02:05:33,780
birthday weekend and you can't
get or anything. So her gift,

2163
02:05:34,290 --> 02:05:37,980
our gift to her was we all had to read
the same book, which was so annoying.

2164
02:05:37,981 --> 02:05:42,130
Don't be friends with rich celebrities.
Um, it was like your homework.

2165
02:05:43,080 --> 02:05:45,870
And I was like so annoyed and an
ended up obviously being excellent.

2166
02:05:45,871 --> 02:05:47,100
Gary Shine Guard is phenomenal.

2167
02:05:47,340 --> 02:05:51,690
So I started giving it to everyone
more as an ego, as a conglomerate,

2168
02:05:51,990 --> 02:05:53,070
as I read fiction guys.

2169
02:05:53,071 --> 02:05:56,430
Like I'm so every night I'm so
cultured and as a pat on the back.

2170
02:05:56,431 --> 02:05:59,340
But I don't want to mislead you into
thinking I actually read fiction.

2171
02:05:59,640 --> 02:06:03,370
I'm not that um, normal. Uh, I, you,

2172
02:06:03,371 --> 02:06:07,770
I give the drama of the gifted child
a lot, uh, to people. You know,

2173
02:06:07,780 --> 02:06:09,030
this book has come up,

2174
02:06:09,090 --> 02:06:14,010
I bet you just in the last week
with a number of very talented,

2175
02:06:14,040 --> 02:06:17,510
yeah, high performers. Yes. Drama,

2176
02:06:18,030 --> 02:06:22,260
the drama of the gifted child.
It's very much,

2177
02:06:23,520 --> 02:06:26,250
yes. If you're a creative person, um,

2178
02:06:26,670 --> 02:06:31,670
if you have any kind of anxiety
or discomfort or just read it,

2179
02:06:31,950 --> 02:06:35,760
it's hard to sum up.
Uh,

2180
02:06:35,761 --> 02:06:38,670
another one I give a
lot is the fantasy bond,

2181
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:43,080
which is incredibly dense and clinical,
but it's about,

2182
02:06:43,860 --> 02:06:44,430
uh,

2183
02:06:44,430 --> 02:06:49,230
essentially what happens between ages
one and three sort of ordained your whole

2184
02:06:49,231 --> 02:06:52,500
life. It's kind of about attachment, um,

2185
02:06:52,530 --> 02:06:56,610
like our attachment strategies based on
how much eye contact we got as a child,

2186
02:06:56,611 --> 02:07:00,000
how we were breastfed,
how much physical contact we got,

2187
02:07:00,001 --> 02:07:03,690
what our dynamics we walked
into as a child, and uh,

2188
02:07:04,230 --> 02:07:06,990
how we see the world according
to those formative years,

2189
02:07:07,320 --> 02:07:11,730
which is pretty fascinating
stuff. Um, about,

2190
02:07:12,150 --> 02:07:13,410
you know,
I think is when you're,

2191
02:07:13,710 --> 02:07:17,730
I think I have a lot of shame around the
fact that I'm almost like an attention

2192
02:07:17,731 --> 02:07:20,490
seeker, if that makes any
sense. Like being a comedian,

2193
02:07:20,491 --> 02:07:22,740
there's just a little bit of
shame for me when it's like,

2194
02:07:22,741 --> 02:07:26,550
why do I have this much of a compulsion
to be seen and heard? Like what is this?

2195
02:07:26,551 --> 02:07:30,180
And once I got a got a handle on the fact
that as a kid I wasn't seen and heard

2196
02:07:30,181 --> 02:07:31,560
enough and I had this,

2197
02:07:31,561 --> 02:07:35,010
I was trying to get these childhood
needs met as an adult through my,

2198
02:07:35,800 --> 02:07:40,100
once I got a handle on that understanding,
it made me need it less. Right.

2199
02:07:40,120 --> 02:07:42,580
You know, I was like, oh my God, I don't
want to be famous. What am I doing?

2200
02:07:42,581 --> 02:07:47,140
This is horrible. I'm like, you can't
undo this. You know, so I feel like,

2201
02:07:47,780 --> 02:07:49,540
you know, I, because I read this book,

2202
02:07:49,570 --> 02:07:53,290
I took like a year off of like being
on TV cause I didn't need that anymore.

2203
02:07:53,590 --> 02:07:56,830
It wasn't like I just need to be seen
as much as possible by as many people as

2204
02:07:56,831 --> 02:08:00,280
possible. That's not unhealthy
compulsion. And, and I,

2205
02:08:00,420 --> 02:08:02,650
that backfired in some ways.

2206
02:08:02,651 --> 02:08:07,180
So I was able to kind of take
control of my self. The fantasy bond.

2207
02:08:07,320 --> 02:08:12,070
You the fantasy Mont it's um, Firestone
rubber Firestone. Maybe it's, yeah,

2208
02:08:12,071 --> 02:08:14,900
it was recommended by, um,
Mark Marin. Actually the, the,

2209
02:08:15,150 --> 02:08:16,570
the epitome of mental health.

2210
02:08:18,830 --> 02:08:23,630
Mark is in large part responsible for me
wanting to experiment with podcasting.

2211
02:08:24,500 --> 02:08:27,260
It's so cool. It's such a great
experience on his podcast. Yeah.

2212
02:08:27,410 --> 02:08:31,940
Joe Rogan's podcast, the Nerdist
podcast. I was like, oh yeah, one thing.

2213
02:08:31,941 --> 02:08:33,560
It's really fun. Yeah. All my faves.

2214
02:08:34,310 --> 02:08:39,220
Yeah. So we were on tour together last
summer and he was reading it and uh,

2215
02:08:39,620 --> 02:08:40,281
I was sort of,

2216
02:08:40,281 --> 02:08:42,770
I think things come in your life exactly
when you need them kind of thing.

2217
02:08:42,771 --> 02:08:46,040
Like this book, the job and the
gifted child. Maybe there's something,

2218
02:08:46,430 --> 02:08:50,150
someone obviously want the universe wants
you to read this book I guess. But, uh,

2219
02:08:50,390 --> 02:08:53,720
I was just didn't a receptive moment and
he was reading it and I was like boom.

2220
02:08:53,750 --> 02:08:57,590
And it was just the perfect time. Cool.
Like, you know, I'll check it out.

2221
02:08:57,770 --> 02:08:59,630
So I've been giving those,
uh,

2222
02:09:00,290 --> 02:09:02,330
another good one because a
lot of my friends having kids,

2223
02:09:02,331 --> 02:09:06,350
it's called the continuum concept and
it's about sort of attachment parenting.

2224
02:09:06,790 --> 02:09:07,270
Is this

2225
02:09:07,270 --> 02:09:10,900
basically like you don't, you
keep the kid with you 24, seven,

2226
02:09:10,920 --> 02:09:12,550
it's all they crawl away kind of thing.

2227
02:09:13,500 --> 02:09:18,390
Yes. And the point is, what was it called?
The continuum. Continuum concept. Okay.

2228
02:09:18,690 --> 02:09:23,690
And oddly it was recommended by my
equine therapy teacher and it's about

2229
02:09:24,930 --> 02:09:27,420
essentially the reason we,

2230
02:09:27,810 --> 02:09:32,070
there's all sorts of chemical reasons
like dopamine and oxytocin that are given

2231
02:09:32,071 --> 02:09:35,520
off when we touch each other and
especially people we love and bond with.

2232
02:09:35,820 --> 02:09:39,780
But that if you always go
to a child when they cry,

2233
02:09:40,020 --> 02:09:42,810
they learn. If I need something,
my needs will get met,

2234
02:09:43,290 --> 02:09:45,480
I can trust that someone
else will meet my needs.

2235
02:09:45,660 --> 02:09:48,720
So attachment parenting is when
your child cries, you go to them,

2236
02:09:48,990 --> 02:09:50,580
you can't necessarily solve their problem,

2237
02:09:50,581 --> 02:09:54,240
but they know that their voice is
being heard and they feel heard.

2238
02:09:54,420 --> 02:09:57,330
So they're more secure, they're
more trusting of their environment.

2239
02:09:57,331 --> 02:09:59,310
They don't deny their
own reality as adults,

2240
02:09:59,770 --> 02:10:02,990
essentially their expectations
for the rest of their future. So

2241
02:10:03,100 --> 02:10:04,950
why did your, if you don't,
let me ask you. Sure.

2242
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:08,620
Equine therapy instead of going to
say x, I was like, oh no, no, no.

2243
02:10:08,621 --> 02:10:10,480
Why did your the

2244
02:10:11,120 --> 02:10:14,110
equine therapy recommend
that? Yeah, we um,

2245
02:10:14,450 --> 02:10:18,530
we're talking about attachment I think,
and we were talking about like,

2246
02:10:18,531 --> 02:10:19,570
oh the horse.
Like I,

2247
02:10:19,580 --> 02:10:23,540
I didn't have trust that the horse
was going to follow me or something.

2248
02:10:23,541 --> 02:10:25,670
Like I was like kept
checking in and she's like,

2249
02:10:25,671 --> 02:10:30,560
you keep cause equine therapy
is so fascinating because
of what comes up the way

2250
02:10:30,561 --> 02:10:32,870
that we, uh, relate to.

2251
02:10:33,630 --> 02:10:37,720
It just says so much about how we try to
run businesses, marriages, relationships.

2252
02:10:37,730 --> 02:10:41,030
It's just a metaphor for everything
because of the way you do anything is the

2253
02:10:41,031 --> 02:10:42,620
way you do everything.
Right.

2254
02:10:42,830 --> 02:10:47,450
So I kept checking in and doubting that
the reality that the horse was following

2255
02:10:47,451 --> 02:10:49,790
me, I was like incredulous that
it was happening. And she's like,

2256
02:10:49,791 --> 02:10:51,590
you really question reality.

2257
02:10:51,591 --> 02:10:54,530
You always doubt yourself and you think
that your perception is wrong and that

2258
02:10:54,560 --> 02:10:57,170
you know that the Damocles
sword is going to fall.

2259
02:10:57,170 --> 02:10:58,730
You're always looking for the catastrophe.

2260
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:03,050
And so she was like read this book and
I did to kind of get an understanding of

2261
02:11:03,051 --> 02:11:05,540
like, oh, something must have happened.
That may be constantly be like,

2262
02:11:05,840 --> 02:11:06,351
and it's true.

2263
02:11:06,351 --> 02:11:08,720
I'm always waiting for the other shoe
to drop when something's going well.

2264
02:11:08,721 --> 02:11:11,750
I'm just like looking around and
said I'm enjoying the moment.

2265
02:11:11,751 --> 02:11:15,280
I'm just waiting for the catastrophe,
you know?

2266
02:11:15,910 --> 02:11:19,390
So it was sort of about
all that blue comedy

2267
02:11:21,590 --> 02:11:26,200
really confusing to me and the expression
waiting for the other shoe to drop.

2268
02:11:26,201 --> 02:11:27,610
And I'm just like,
I interesting.

2269
02:11:27,760 --> 02:11:30,280
Well cause you know what I always think
of when I think of waiting for the other

2270
02:11:30,281 --> 02:11:35,281
shoe to drop his shoes on a
phone line in a bad neighborhood.

2271
02:11:37,960 --> 02:11:42,030
What do you think that means?
Wait a second. You know,

2272
02:11:42,560 --> 02:11:47,440
what do I think of your envisioning?
That means wait.

2273
02:11:47,920 --> 02:11:50,200
Okay.
I always think of bad,

2274
02:11:50,201 --> 02:11:52,540
she was in the neighborhood when I think
of waiting for the other shoe to drop.

2275
02:11:52,570 --> 02:11:56,050
That's the vision that
comes to mind. Yeah. Also,

2276
02:11:56,470 --> 02:11:59,620
do you know what it means when shoes
are hanging in a bad neighborhood?

2277
02:12:00,330 --> 02:12:03,640
I don't know. You've seen it,
right? I always thought it
was just kids being dicks.

2278
02:12:03,641 --> 02:12:05,710
But martial artist,

2279
02:12:06,200 --> 02:12:09,760
I think I'm probably totally wrong
apparently. Right. It's cause you know,

2280
02:12:09,761 --> 02:12:11,290
like in a photo you'll see a fall in line,

2281
02:12:11,291 --> 02:12:13,480
you'll see a pair of sneakers
hanging in bad neighborhoods.

2282
02:12:13,840 --> 02:12:17,650
Apparently it's where someone
died of heroin. So you know,

2283
02:12:17,651 --> 02:12:22,300
that's where the best heroin is. So when
people see shoes hanging, thank you.

2284
02:12:22,750 --> 02:12:27,490
I got it. Right. Ninja. I got an injury
on an approved Hashtag on it. Um,

2285
02:12:27,820 --> 02:12:29,770
and then you know,
that's where you should buy heroin.

2286
02:12:29,771 --> 02:12:33,530
Cause that's the purest stuff cause
it killed someone. That's insane.

2287
02:12:33,890 --> 02:12:35,090
Insane blue comedy.

2288
02:12:37,730 --> 02:12:41,870
That's Travis brewer. I,
he brewer making a cameo.

2289
02:12:42,320 --> 02:12:45,200
Uh,
when you think of the word successful,

2290
02:12:45,201 --> 02:12:48,440
who's the first person that comes to mind?
Steve Jobs. Steve Jobs. Is that weird?

2291
02:12:48,441 --> 02:12:49,610
I like him anyway though.

2292
02:12:49,611 --> 02:12:54,560
So that was like on the
tip of my brain brain when,

2293
02:12:55,390 --> 02:12:58,520
okay. However, if you had, if you
had to choose a second person,

2294
02:13:00,860 --> 02:13:04,490
uh, it has to be the tip of my
brain does not, I'm overthinking it.

2295
02:13:05,970 --> 02:13:06,271
Well,

2296
02:13:06,271 --> 02:13:10,440
I was just going to say something that
is just going to open up a weird can of

2297
02:13:10,441 --> 02:13:13,230
worms because I was
Gunna say Shel Sandberg,

2298
02:13:13,231 --> 02:13:18,160
cause I feel like she had this well
rounded life and a personal life also, um,

2299
02:13:18,480 --> 02:13:23,080
which recently imploded,
um, which is not funny.

2300
02:13:23,140 --> 02:13:25,300
Uh,
but like someone who had,

2301
02:13:25,301 --> 02:13:28,030
I think I used to define success as
someone at the top of their field

2302
02:13:28,060 --> 02:13:29,080
professionally only.

2303
02:13:29,081 --> 02:13:33,990
And now I also view it as someone who has
balanced like a good relationship with

2304
02:13:34,260 --> 02:13:37,080
friends and family.
You know,

2305
02:13:37,980 --> 02:13:42,600
time has fun. Uh, when they're not
working, they're actually not working.

2306
02:13:42,870 --> 02:13:45,990
Um, so that's why I was thinking
about her and Drew Barrymore.

2307
02:13:46,020 --> 02:13:47,880
This is really weird,
but I follow her on Instagram.

2308
02:13:48,060 --> 02:13:51,330
She really seems to go to the beach a lot.
She's got a cosmetic less,

2309
02:13:51,331 --> 02:13:54,840
she has two kids. She seemed to have
kind of nailed it. I was just like, God,

2310
02:13:54,841 --> 02:13:59,500
it's just, that must be
nice. Um, Steve Johnson,

2311
02:13:59,520 --> 02:14:03,000
Drew Barrymore, that's you know, and
Sheryl Sandberg, that's a Trifecta.

2312
02:14:05,130 --> 02:14:07,950
Motley Crue.
Elon Musk is a good one.

2313
02:14:07,980 --> 02:14:11,940
I mean I don't really know about his
personal life, but he's in terms of,

2314
02:14:12,630 --> 02:14:15,660
you know, making an impact. I think
he's probably done a pretty good job.

2315
02:14:16,860 --> 02:14:19,860
Yes, you're pretty successful. He's,

2316
02:14:19,920 --> 02:14:22,650
he's very good at betting the
farm and pulling it off. Yeah.

2317
02:14:22,651 --> 02:14:26,550
Like I mean I think you made 180 million
from the sale of paypal and he took all

2318
02:14:26,551 --> 02:14:30,720
of it and put it into three companies
and had to borrow money for rent.

2319
02:14:30,860 --> 02:14:32,230
Yeah.
He's like a bill burr.

2320
02:14:33,110 --> 02:14:36,950
He keeps making himself poor so
he has to get rich again. Yeah.

2321
02:14:36,980 --> 02:14:40,100
Like how to fill bombs in comparison yet.
You know,

2322
02:14:40,280 --> 02:14:44,270
cause it's interesting cause I want to,
all these comedians came to mind.

2323
02:14:45,130 --> 02:14:48,220
Like I was thinking Richard Pryor and
Louis C K and Jerry Seinfeld and I,

2324
02:14:48,230 --> 02:14:51,410
all these comedians were coming to mind.
But I think for me,

2325
02:14:51,440 --> 02:14:56,030
because I've seen the other,
what the success has cost
them. Yeah. You, you know,

2326
02:14:56,031 --> 02:14:57,380
how the sausage is made.
Yes.

2327
02:14:57,381 --> 02:15:02,381
So I don't know a lot or Steve jobs
is what it costs them emotionally,

2328
02:15:03,240 --> 02:15:05,930
family wise. So I'm a little
bit naive about it. Yeah.

2329
02:15:06,200 --> 02:15:10,010
So in job's case a lot. A Lot,
I'm sure. Well, cause yeah,

2330
02:15:10,011 --> 02:15:11,450
and it was interesting
because everybody always,

2331
02:15:11,780 --> 02:15:14,270
I think the reason I sort
of latched on to him,

2332
02:15:14,271 --> 02:15:17,680
I mean it's obviously a
pretty hacky on original, uh,

2333
02:15:18,080 --> 02:15:22,700
inspiring figure. But I think when
I was the boss for the first time,

2334
02:15:22,701 --> 02:15:26,270
I think I for some reason looked up to
him in a way because everyone was like,

2335
02:15:26,271 --> 02:15:28,550
oh, he's an asshole. He's
crazy. And I was like, I just,

2336
02:15:28,910 --> 02:15:32,690
maybe everyone who's the US is crazy
because no one likes their boss because

2337
02:15:32,691 --> 02:15:36,860
they're telling them to do work, you
know? And I remember people were like, oh,

2338
02:15:36,861 --> 02:15:40,550
he was such a Dick. Like he would,
you know, if something wasn't perfect,

2339
02:15:40,580 --> 02:15:43,950
he'd make them fix it. And I'd be
like, oh, what's so wrong with that?

2340
02:15:43,980 --> 02:15:46,760
What you're supposed to do. I mean,
that sounds like a great boss, you know,

2341
02:15:46,761 --> 02:15:48,260
he sounds like a great leader,
you know?

2342
02:15:48,261 --> 02:15:51,380
And I hear all these horror stories and
I think that I started getting paranoid

2343
02:15:51,381 --> 02:15:54,920
that people thought I was difficult.
And I do, you know? And I'm like,

2344
02:15:54,921 --> 02:15:57,210
why is it difficult to say I
think we can do better? Yeah.

2345
02:15:57,330 --> 02:16:02,120
I think we can beat this
joke. Like I'm not, I'm just
like, I want this to be good.

2346
02:16:02,121 --> 02:16:03,200
All of our names are on it.

2347
02:16:03,201 --> 02:16:05,420
You're getting paid a tremendous
amount of money to be here.

2348
02:16:05,421 --> 02:16:06,950
Why am I such a jerk?
You know?

2349
02:16:07,310 --> 02:16:11,150
And I think that through the lens of
people's Egos and, and feelings and stuff,

2350
02:16:11,151 --> 02:16:14,030
it just ends up being like, oh, he's
crazy. He's an asshole. You know?

2351
02:16:14,070 --> 02:16:18,200
I'm yet to meet or know of one successful
person who everyone doesn't think is

2352
02:16:18,201 --> 02:16:19,034
crazy.

2353
02:16:19,300 --> 02:16:23,900
Yeah, yeah. Right. Yeah. It's pretty much
just means they're par for the course.

2354
02:16:23,920 --> 02:16:27,260
Yeah. Generally speaking.
Yeah. He's crazy. He's fucking
notice a psycho. It's like,

2355
02:16:27,261 --> 02:16:30,030
okay. Or are you just catch someone on an
off day? You know what I mean? Like, I've,

2356
02:16:30,030 --> 02:16:34,450
I've met some people who are celebrities
who in person every time I've seen them

2357
02:16:34,480 --> 02:16:36,520
in interaction with other people with me,
they've been great.

2358
02:16:37,030 --> 02:16:40,890
But I'd read things about them
online at some point where, you know,

2359
02:16:40,960 --> 02:16:41,980
someone's like, oh my God, you know,

2360
02:16:41,981 --> 02:16:45,100
I was touring with this guy and
he wouldn't sign fans, autographs.

2361
02:16:45,101 --> 02:16:47,350
He was a dick that it, I'm
like, maybe just had a bad day.

2362
02:16:47,380 --> 02:16:50,140
I like how you broke up
with his girlfriend or like,

2363
02:16:50,260 --> 02:16:53,860
who the hell knows it was in
the airport. And um, you know,

2364
02:16:53,861 --> 02:16:55,630
people were asking for pictures and I,

2365
02:16:55,750 --> 02:16:58,360
my dad had just had a stroke and I
was like, I'm just sorry I can't.

2366
02:16:58,361 --> 02:17:00,990
And I'm sure that those people are
going, she's such an asshole. Like,

2367
02:17:01,120 --> 02:17:05,770
I'm sure they were, you know, but it's
just not, you know, we just can't concern.

2368
02:17:05,860 --> 02:17:09,070
What do you think of me is none of my
business, et cetera. You know, Louis C K,

2369
02:17:09,310 --> 02:17:11,530
I don't know if you know
this, it interests me. Uh,

2370
02:17:11,560 --> 02:17:14,530
he doesn't take photos with people,
but he says,

2371
02:17:14,890 --> 02:17:17,800
I won't take a photo with you but I
will talk to you for five minutes.

2372
02:17:18,700 --> 02:17:22,270
And he says, almost
everybody declined. Oh,

2373
02:17:22,271 --> 02:17:26,680
I bet they just want the photo now. Why
doesn't he do the photos? I don't know.

2374
02:17:26,681 --> 02:17:29,250
I think it's, I don't remember. I guess,

2375
02:17:29,410 --> 02:17:32,260
I guess maybe it's like if
you're going to occupy this time,

2376
02:17:32,261 --> 02:17:33,580
I want you to have to
do some work as well.

2377
02:17:35,350 --> 02:17:38,350
Maybe like what am I going to get
out of this? Well, no, not even that,

2378
02:17:38,351 --> 02:17:41,410
but it's just, you know, if we're going
to have an exchange that's an exchange.

2379
02:17:41,930 --> 02:17:44,200
Let's, if you want to connect, let's
really connect. I think, I mean,

2380
02:17:44,201 --> 02:17:48,340
I'm sure he has a really interesting
reason why he doesn't. Um,

2381
02:17:48,760 --> 02:17:52,240
but uh, I think because also
it's like there's no, you know,

2382
02:17:52,241 --> 02:17:54,550
I say getting your picture
taken is just so weird. I mean,

2383
02:17:54,551 --> 02:17:56,170
especially on like a press
line. Like, you know,

2384
02:17:56,171 --> 02:17:59,110
an actress has have to go down a
press line and just like pose, I said,

2385
02:17:59,500 --> 02:18:01,690
I mean I've stopped kind
of doing it cause I'm like,

2386
02:18:01,810 --> 02:18:06,490
unless someone gives me a healthy inner
monologue to recite while I'm doing that,

2387
02:18:06,491 --> 02:18:08,200
I'm not going to do it. Cause
what are you, you're just like,

2388
02:18:08,380 --> 02:18:10,440
look at me and my sexy, my thin
enough. Do you want to say like,

2389
02:18:10,450 --> 02:18:14,200
it's just such unhealthy things that
you're thinking what's in my head every

2390
02:18:14,201 --> 02:18:18,230
time I read somewhere
that you ride the subway.

2391
02:18:18,700 --> 02:18:20,560
So it's like,
I'm sure when he's posing with someone,

2392
02:18:20,561 --> 02:18:22,660
it's just like you just in San Francisco,

2393
02:18:22,661 --> 02:18:25,840
it's kind of like the Mad Max
Marauder version of the subway.

2394
02:18:25,900 --> 02:18:28,720
I like that outdoor one.

2395
02:18:28,721 --> 02:18:33,230
And who would you ever carpet
a place is filthy car? I Dunno.

2396
02:18:33,390 --> 02:18:38,230
It's not the trolley. No
anything. Yeah, exactly.

2397
02:18:38,850 --> 02:18:41,580
They get along
hyperloop,

2398
02:18:42,900 --> 02:18:47,530
the hyper carpet hypercarbia load.
Hypercarbia and uh, so I think that, yeah,

2399
02:18:47,531 --> 02:18:49,930
I think he just felt like he feels like,
you know,

2400
02:18:50,350 --> 02:18:52,930
you can feel kind of violated someone
just ambushing you. And, I mean,

2401
02:18:52,931 --> 02:18:55,510
he's with his kids and he's, you
know, I think when you have a family,

2402
02:18:55,511 --> 02:18:58,450
I can only imagine if one person gets one,

2403
02:18:58,451 --> 02:19:01,900
then all of a sudden everybody wants
one and then you're going to, you know,

2404
02:19:01,901 --> 02:19:05,170
so I think he just, you
know, whatever, for whatever
reason, I'm sure he has a, um,

2405
02:19:06,100 --> 02:19:09,430
you know, dignified reason
for it. But nobody ever, like,

2406
02:19:09,510 --> 02:19:11,540
I mean to talk to Louis
C K for five minutes,

2407
02:19:11,541 --> 02:19:14,590
it could be the best five minutes of your
life. And people are like, no thanks.

2408
02:19:15,430 --> 02:19:18,340
We just want, I just wanted to Instagram,
I didn't show off that I met you.

2409
02:19:18,430 --> 02:19:21,940
This is about me. It's not about you.
I mean this like culture of narcissism.

2410
02:19:21,941 --> 02:19:24,190
I remember I was at the
People's choice awards,

2411
02:19:24,191 --> 02:19:28,700
which is like a really silly
award show. Um, but you know,

2412
02:19:28,701 --> 02:19:32,150
they have seat fillers,
fillers. The fillers is like,

2413
02:19:32,151 --> 02:19:33,440
there's all the celebrities there,

2414
02:19:33,441 --> 02:19:37,280
but then everyone else that's
in the audience are like
paid seat fillers who are

2415
02:19:37,281 --> 02:19:41,130
super attractive and it's like
an Indonesian political round.

2416
02:19:42,640 --> 02:19:47,060
Yeah, absolutely. That's
so funny. Yeah, no,

2417
02:19:47,061 --> 02:19:47,894
I didn't know that.

2418
02:19:48,410 --> 02:19:52,010
I love you and I as reference points are
so different and yours are so much more

2419
02:19:52,011 --> 02:19:53,660
impressive. Um, and uh,

2420
02:19:53,661 --> 02:19:56,390
so they get paid 50 bucks to dress pretty
and look good because they're going to

2421
02:19:56,391 --> 02:20:00,470
be on camera, maybe in a pan shot or
something. And so I'm sitting in front of,

2422
02:20:01,220 --> 02:20:05,210
I want to say Allen's in front of me,
but Ellen had gone on stage,

2423
02:20:05,211 --> 02:20:07,940
so this is actually so, but there's
all these seat fillers. A Beautiful,

2424
02:20:07,941 --> 02:20:09,000
I can't tell who the,

2425
02:20:09,050 --> 02:20:12,500
I mean the seat fillers are more attracted
than celebrities. I mean, it's like, um,

2426
02:20:13,190 --> 02:20:18,080
and so on stage, is that what I say?
Ellen and Chris Pine, who was that?

2427
02:20:18,110 --> 02:20:19,730
You know, whatever actor, a famous actor.

2428
02:20:20,210 --> 02:20:25,210
And I see these people holding up
their cameras and I'm like looking at,

2429
02:20:25,960 --> 02:20:30,530
we're trying to look over them and
I see that they're taking selfies of

2430
02:20:30,531 --> 02:20:33,500
themselves. And I'm like, no,
the celebrities are that way.

2431
02:20:34,010 --> 02:20:35,970
You're not the celebrity. I mean, people,

2432
02:20:35,971 --> 02:20:38,840
there's a celebrity two feet in front
of them and they're taking a picture of

2433
02:20:38,841 --> 02:20:42,410
themselves. Yeah. I mean
it's just like, you know,

2434
02:20:42,960 --> 02:20:46,890
it was crazy. Yeah. It's a
bizarre flip it around. Yeah.

2435
02:20:47,090 --> 02:20:51,410
It's a bizarre world we live in. Yeah.
Just to just a few last questions.

2436
02:20:51,800 --> 02:20:56,800
You could put a billboard anywhere and
have anything you want on the billboard

2437
02:20:57,760 --> 02:21:00,260
texts photo. What would
it be? Where would it be?

2438
02:21:00,320 --> 02:21:04,580
Like a message I would want to get out
or message or it could be a photo of

2439
02:21:04,581 --> 02:21:08,810
anything. Anything. Wow. This
is a really good question.

2440
02:21:08,811 --> 02:21:12,920
You should have a podcast. Um, if I could,

2441
02:21:13,610 --> 02:21:17,280
well,
everyone's got their things right there.

2442
02:21:17,720 --> 02:21:21,980
Thing causes and my cause is dogs.

2443
02:21:22,720 --> 02:21:25,610
That's, everyone's got their
thing and I'm sure that, you know,

2444
02:21:25,611 --> 02:21:28,670
when something else touches me
that will be my thing. You know,

2445
02:21:28,671 --> 02:21:32,330
and cancer touches my family or whatever.
Alcoholism has touched my family,

2446
02:21:32,331 --> 02:21:36,560
but I haven't been compelled to
like get super in the trenches of,

2447
02:21:37,160 --> 02:21:37,971
of that.

2448
02:21:37,971 --> 02:21:42,971
But I'm a statistic that really affected
me to statistics that I just sort of

2449
02:21:43,761 --> 02:21:48,761
wish people knew was that 3 million dogs
die a year in shelters and 17 million a

2450
02:21:50,571 --> 02:21:54,500
year get bought.
So it's just like

2451
02:21:56,320 --> 02:22:00,740
the three. Shouldn't it crazy math. Yeah,
it should be. Don't make me do this math.

2452
02:22:00,741 --> 02:22:05,330
Yeah. 14 a year I bought that should
just be the statistic. Right. So,

2453
02:22:05,331 --> 02:22:07,970
uh, that was something that just
hearing that I was like, God,

2454
02:22:07,971 --> 02:22:08,930
that is such a waste.

2455
02:22:08,960 --> 02:22:13,960
That's just so much death and it's just
so karmically bad for just this species.

2456
02:22:15,471 --> 02:22:18,830
And so, um, uh, so yeah, that's
something that's sort of one,

2457
02:22:18,880 --> 02:22:21,620
I was always kind of trying to do dog
rescue and I didn't really know how.

2458
02:22:21,621 --> 02:22:24,170
And once I got that statistic, I felt
kind of emboldened to be like, all right,

2459
02:22:24,171 --> 02:22:27,210
I know exactly where my energy can go.
It was very empowering to learn that.

2460
02:22:27,600 --> 02:22:28,650
And another thing is,
um,

2461
02:22:28,651 --> 02:22:32,220
I work with this a charity called
the Beagle freedom project. Um,

2462
02:22:32,280 --> 02:22:34,890
that's bagels that are tested on in labs,
um,

2463
02:22:34,950 --> 02:22:37,710
that the tests are usually an ain
and like don't do much. It's just,

2464
02:22:37,711 --> 02:22:40,530
you can say a product is tested
on an animal and that it's safe.

2465
02:22:40,890 --> 02:22:42,930
And this statistic kind of blew my mind,

2466
02:22:43,190 --> 02:22:46,190
which is that beagles are chosen to be,
um,

2467
02:22:46,500 --> 02:22:51,300
the dog's tested on in labs because
they're the most forgiving of all dog

2468
02:22:51,301 --> 02:22:52,020
breeds.

2469
02:22:52,020 --> 02:22:54,720
So you can hurt them a bunch of times
and they'll still give you the benefit of

2470
02:22:54,721 --> 02:22:58,190
the doubt and they'll still keep
forgiving you. Heartbreaking.

2471
02:22:58,200 --> 02:23:02,760
So once I heard that, I was like, I'm in,
you're preying on the weakest, sweetest.

2472
02:23:02,761 --> 02:23:05,790
And so I got involved in that and uh,
you know,

2473
02:23:05,791 --> 02:23:09,480
I think that if you don't have
kids, you know, and if you're busy,

2474
02:23:09,481 --> 02:23:13,920
like you and I are and you travel a lot,
dogs is just a really sort of easy,

2475
02:23:13,921 --> 02:23:18,060
rewarding sort of healthy
thing and those two.

2476
02:23:18,061 --> 02:23:20,280
So I feel like I would just
put those on billboards maybe

2477
02:23:21,840 --> 02:23:24,450
in China at the dog meat festival.

2478
02:23:27,210 --> 02:23:30,540
That's probably the location I would pick.
The Yulin dog meat festival.

2479
02:23:31,620 --> 02:23:36,210
It makes me crazy. Is there a dog be fest?
Oh my God. The Yulin dog meat festival.

2480
02:23:36,211 --> 02:23:40,170
Yeah. So, uh, this obviously means
you don't follow me on Instagram. Um,

2481
02:23:40,590 --> 02:23:45,270
which is Stop Ulan 2015 is my, a
big obsession right now. But yeah,

2482
02:23:45,271 --> 02:23:48,390
there's a dog meat festival that's
going on I think right now in China, uh,

2483
02:23:48,630 --> 02:23:51,600
where they actually kidnapped
people's domesticated dogs.

2484
02:23:51,980 --> 02:23:55,560
So you just wake up and
your dogs are gone. And then
there's a dog meat festival.

2485
02:23:55,650 --> 02:23:57,780
It's, I mean, here's the thing with China,

2486
02:23:57,781 --> 02:23:59,490
they don't treat their
people that great either.

2487
02:23:59,590 --> 02:24:02,580
I'm much less their dogs
or their children. So, uh,

2488
02:24:02,581 --> 02:24:06,550
that's a bigger issue that I'm not really
qualified to talk about. But yeah. Wow.

2489
02:24:07,240 --> 02:24:10,650
Dog me Puzzle. But whenever I tell
people whenever I'm like doing,

2490
02:24:10,710 --> 02:24:13,950
I think a lot of people want to help dogs.
It's just such an or animals or cats,

2491
02:24:13,951 --> 02:24:17,760
anything too big of an issue.
And like as soon as they hear that,

2492
02:24:17,761 --> 02:24:20,160
like beagles the most that people like,
how do I help?

2493
02:24:20,190 --> 02:24:23,570
And a lot of people don't even know
they're getting arrested on the goals.

2494
02:24:23,620 --> 02:24:26,910
The goals are the most tested on dog
species. They're also the most forgiving.

2495
02:24:28,510 --> 02:24:32,600
What'd you call ms.com buy tickets.
There we go. Download my stuff off.

2496
02:24:32,920 --> 02:24:37,170
Delo myself. No, I'm using it.
Actually donate. Donate just to me.

2497
02:24:38,090 --> 02:24:39,300
I just got this to get your attention.

2498
02:24:40,590 --> 02:24:44,310
I just wanted to capture your heart so
then I could then manipulate you into

2499
02:24:44,311 --> 02:24:48,760
buying me a vacation home. Gotcha. Gotcha.

2500
02:24:51,090 --> 02:24:55,440
That's political circle research. It's
like, I'm glad you asked that question.

2501
02:24:55,500 --> 02:24:56,520
Let me

2502
02:24:59,440 --> 02:25:03,120
also think that like donating to animals
is just my drug of choice. I guess.

2503
02:25:03,121 --> 02:25:05,370
I don't drink, I drank,
but I'm not, you know,

2504
02:25:06,300 --> 02:25:10,650
not like to access and I know do drugs
like when I give money to and I feel as

2505
02:25:10,651 --> 02:25:14,580
good. So I just feel like a lot of
people, like once they start it's,

2506
02:25:14,581 --> 02:25:17,940
you feel good if you give 20 bucks
to whatever, you know, it's like,

2507
02:25:18,600 --> 02:25:20,550
I think everyone would be,
everybody wins.

2508
02:25:21,510 --> 02:25:26,510
What advice would you give
to your 25 year old self?

2509
02:25:29,130 --> 02:25:33,790
25. Uh, there's so much advice.

2510
02:25:33,850 --> 02:25:38,030
I would say don't wear any of what
you're wearing right now, which was,

2511
02:25:38,440 --> 02:25:40,060
which was, you know, it's funny,

2512
02:25:40,061 --> 02:25:45,061
I dressed like a boy from the 70s
until I was like 29 new vintage,

2513
02:25:46,601 --> 02:25:51,460
new balance sneakers, bell bottoms,
and a Hoodie with a backpack. You know,

2514
02:25:51,461 --> 02:25:54,710
I was very, that was my uniform. Um,

2515
02:25:54,730 --> 02:25:58,720
which was kind of like my shield of like,
please don't see me as a sexual being.

2516
02:25:58,721 --> 02:26:01,660
Like when I did stand up, you know,
I tried to really like neutralize my,

2517
02:26:01,661 --> 02:26:04,900
like gender, um, and uh,

2518
02:26:05,320 --> 02:26:09,190
stop drinking diet coke,
stopped drinking aspartame.

2519
02:26:09,700 --> 02:26:13,720
I feel like I just missed
the new thing of that.

2520
02:26:13,721 --> 02:26:17,910
That was like my early twenties in
college was all artificial sweeteners and

2521
02:26:17,920 --> 02:26:19,300
crap that I feel like I'm going to be,

2522
02:26:19,720 --> 02:26:22,600
that's why I'm drinking
the stupid beet juice. Um,

2523
02:26:22,990 --> 02:26:26,170
and I think it really compromise
my productivity and my, you know,

2524
02:26:26,171 --> 02:26:30,610
who knows what that was doing to
my brain chemistry. Um, and uh,

2525
02:26:31,180 --> 02:26:36,180
I think maybe the main thing is those
mistakes are actually getting you to

2526
02:26:36,971 --> 02:26:41,560
exactly where you want to go.
They're rerouting you to your dreams,

2527
02:26:41,980 --> 02:26:46,420
you know, and they're not, I hate
the word failure because I always,

2528
02:26:46,450 --> 02:26:49,840
I always think it's just like a step
in the right direction, you know?

2529
02:26:49,841 --> 02:26:53,140
So all the things that I agonized
over the jobs I didn't get.

2530
02:26:53,141 --> 02:26:55,600
I mean I like was in bed,

2531
02:26:56,110 --> 02:27:01,110
like crying my eyes out for like a week
cause I didn't get it job as a VH one,

2532
02:27:04,080 --> 02:27:08,560
like host of account down.
I mean something that would
just be so embarrassing.

2533
02:27:08,561 --> 02:27:10,450
If you saw my Wikipedia page day,
I'd be like,

2534
02:27:10,451 --> 02:27:12,730
can we really don't talk about that?
It would have been a thing that I said,

2535
02:27:12,731 --> 02:27:15,460
please don't talk about it on the podcast.
So would've been so embarrassing now,

2536
02:27:15,670 --> 02:27:20,320
but at the time it was like I was just
the holy grail. I was destroyed over it.

2537
02:27:20,321 --> 02:27:22,030
You know what? I didn't
realize, oh my God.

2538
02:27:22,031 --> 02:27:24,730
And a couple of years
like I dodged a bullet,

2539
02:27:25,240 --> 02:27:27,130
so I wished that I had kind of,

2540
02:27:27,131 --> 02:27:29,530
I would have saved a lot of
time and energy and anguish.

2541
02:27:29,600 --> 02:27:32,950
Mistakes are taking you where you
want to go. Yes, exactly. Exactly.

2542
02:27:34,030 --> 02:27:37,300
This has been great.
Where can people learn more about you?

2543
02:27:37,910 --> 02:27:42,910
Ashley Madison Whitehouse.

2544
02:27:44,240 --> 02:27:48,800
Dot. Porn. I literally got this call
the other day. My lawyer was like, Hey,

2545
02:27:48,801 --> 02:27:52,480
we need to buy your.porn. And I was like,
are we, we changed in the game plan.

2546
02:27:53,200 --> 02:27:56,770
Is there something I don't know down?
Yeah,

2547
02:27:58,160 --> 02:28:03,040
but dop, the dop, porn is about to come
out, so you have to buy your domain.

2548
02:28:04,210 --> 02:28:08,440
You're welcome. Thank you.
Yeah, Yours Tim Ferriss.

2549
02:28:08,441 --> 02:28:10,990
Stop Porn we routed to your blog,

2550
02:28:12,760 --> 02:28:17,020
to your website. There you go. Uh,

2551
02:28:18,640 --> 02:28:21,590
so the homebase is

2552
02:28:22,010 --> 02:28:22,843
where should people go?

2553
02:28:22,940 --> 02:28:26,030
Uh, well, well my tour dates and
stuff are all Whitney cummings.com.

2554
02:28:26,090 --> 02:28:28,070
And then I have Twitter,
Whitney Cummings,

2555
02:28:28,370 --> 02:28:33,370
my Instagram is Whitney a Cummings
because Whitney Cummings is a 15 year old

2556
02:28:33,441 --> 02:28:37,340
black aspiring singer who
is pretty talented actually.

2557
02:28:37,341 --> 02:28:41,780
It has a lot of followers. Thanks to
me in the eyes has posted two photos.

2558
02:28:42,080 --> 02:28:45,770
Um, but uh, yeah, Whitney
a Cummings. Got It. Yeah.

2559
02:28:46,350 --> 02:28:49,620
And any last ask of the audience,

2560
02:28:49,621 --> 02:28:52,080
if you could ask the audience to
do one thing, what would it be?

2561
02:28:54,030 --> 02:28:58,980
Um, besides visit the
website. So provocative.

2562
02:28:59,010 --> 02:29:00,870
I'm like using birth of my brains.
I never use,

2563
02:29:01,080 --> 02:29:05,490
if I could ask the audience to
do one thing, what would it be?

2564
02:29:06,120 --> 02:29:10,590
Um, God, that's a really deep
question. I have so many thoughts.

2565
02:29:11,280 --> 02:29:13,740
Um,
I mean,

2566
02:29:14,940 --> 02:29:19,770
do you do your thing live out loud,

2567
02:29:19,830 --> 02:29:24,390
be authentic? I don't know.
Is that you ask that question.

2568
02:29:24,391 --> 02:29:27,300
I've having heard your house,
I don't ask it too often.

2569
02:29:27,480 --> 02:29:31,500
If you could ask the
audience to do one thing. Um,

2570
02:29:32,220 --> 02:29:33,660
watch comedy.
It's good for you.

2571
02:29:34,690 --> 02:29:37,180
Okay. No, I'll, I'll dig
on that for a second.

2572
02:29:37,660 --> 02:29:41,710
If somebody who's seen comedy
occasionally, but it's not a connoisseur,

2573
02:29:41,740 --> 02:29:46,240
wants to enjoy comedy more, get
more out of it. If they're watching,

2574
02:29:46,241 --> 02:29:47,200
say a Stan Oh,
special,

2575
02:29:47,740 --> 02:29:52,740
what should they pay attention to or
think of to see kind of an extra layer or

2576
02:29:53,651 --> 02:29:55,000
ask themselves anything?

2577
02:29:56,710 --> 02:30:01,480
I think that there's,
I think look at what offends you.

2578
02:30:02,710 --> 02:30:05,740
If something offends you.
Watch Richard Pryor.

2579
02:30:05,741 --> 02:30:09,940
Watch Daniel tosh watched the
most incendiary comedians,

2580
02:30:10,180 --> 02:30:10,871
Bill Burr,

2581
02:30:10,871 --> 02:30:15,871
maybe Louis C k his monologue that he
just did on SNL that there was this outcry

2582
02:30:16,391 --> 02:30:20,110
because you talked about pedophiles or
something. If something offends you,

2583
02:30:20,740 --> 02:30:24,610
look inward, that's a sign
that there's something there.

2584
02:30:25,480 --> 02:30:29,750
What offends someone says a lot
about them. Agreed. You know,

2585
02:30:29,980 --> 02:30:32,170
I think it was may west to
said those were shocked easily.

2586
02:30:32,171 --> 02:30:33,250
She'd be shocked more often.

2587
02:30:33,950 --> 02:30:38,600
I like that. I like that. I love, I have
a huge poster of West in my office. Um,

2588
02:30:38,650 --> 02:30:39,483
but uh,

2589
02:30:39,670 --> 02:30:43,740
who a lot of people think was a man
and a lot of people think she was wet.

2590
02:30:44,460 --> 02:30:48,670
Huh. Interesting. Their original
Rachel Doughlas all, is that her name?

2591
02:30:48,700 --> 02:30:53,170
The girl who just pretended to be black?
The Naacp woman? I don't know. Yeah,

2592
02:30:53,171 --> 02:30:57,660
she was like, uh, I was on a plane
yesterday. I was way too deep into, uh,

2593
02:30:57,850 --> 02:31:00,070
the news. Um, but uh, yeah,

2594
02:31:00,071 --> 02:31:03,520
I would say look at what offends you and
it'll probably help you with some self

2595
02:31:03,521 --> 02:31:04,300
awareness.

2596
02:31:04,300 --> 02:31:08,770
That's great. Yeah. I love
it. Thank you so much for the
time. This is great. Thanks.

2597
02:31:08,830 --> 02:31:11,350
All right to be continued.
And until next time,

2598
02:31:11,470 --> 02:31:13,210

ropes may says steel clubs.

2605
02:31:40,570 --> 02:31:42,720
It sounds like a torture
chamber and it kind of is.

2606
02:31:42,721 --> 02:31:44,730
It's a torture chamber
for self improvement.

2612
02:32:05,670 --> 02:32:08,730
this episode is brought to you by
a new sponsor. So listen up folks.

2613
02:32:08,731 --> 02:32:12,690
This is a good one because have you ever
wanted to be as powerful as a bullet

2614
02:32:12,691 --> 02:32:17,691
wearing Ninja from an 1880s movie or
as flamboyant as big gay Al Big Al when

2615
02:32:18,870 --> 02:32:23,200
South Park or a sleek as a black
panther in the Amazon on the hunt? Well,

2616
02:32:23,220 --> 02:32:27,300
there's great news because I've been
testing this product that you wrap around

2617
02:32:27,301 --> 02:32:30,660
your genitals and it makes you feel
like a superhero and it is called

2618
02:32:30,690 --> 02:32:31,523
[inaudible].

2619
02:32:31,530 --> 02:32:35,070
That's been the last two to three weeks
traveling with underwear from these guys

2620
02:32:35,130 --> 02:32:37,380
and they are comfy.
I gotta tell you,

2621
02:32:37,680 --> 02:32:42,030
it feels like a Geisha has giving your
groin a hug and it's not just for dudes.

2622
02:32:42,031 --> 02:32:46,530

uh, I will also highlight my favorite,

2626
02:32:56,580 --> 02:33:00,120
you'll probably be able to guess which
it is these underwear made from micro

2627
02:33:00,121 --> 02:33:05,070
model, which is extruded from Austrian
beechwood trees in the Alps. Yes. Fancy.

2628
02:33:05,250 --> 02:33:06,840
And it's two times softer than cotton,

2629
02:33:07,050 --> 02:33:11,550
scientifically tested using the Kawabata
method developed in Kyoto. You know,

2630
02:33:11,551 --> 02:33:15,930
those Japanese very crafty and uh,
