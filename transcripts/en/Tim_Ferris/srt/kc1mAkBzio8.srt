00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,180
Hello Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:01,181 --> 00:00:05,050
this is Tim Ferriss and welcome to
another episode of the Tim Ferriss show.

3
00:00:05,051 --> 00:00:05,950
Thank you for listening.

4
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:11,370
We have an incredible guest
today and his name is Ed Catmull.

5
00:00:11,531 --> 00:00:13,900
He's the cofounder of
Pixar Animation Studios,

6
00:00:13,901 --> 00:00:18,190
which you started with Steve Jobs and
John Lasseter and president of Pixar

7
00:00:18,191 --> 00:00:20,140
animation and Disney animation.

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,940
It has also received five academy awards
and as a computer scientist he has

9
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:28,720
contributed to many of the most important
developments in computer graphics.

10
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,710
He has done a hell of a lot and in this
episode we talk about many different

11
00:00:32,711 --> 00:00:35,110
things.
The birth of Pixar,

12
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,860
his background going from a
technician to more of a manager,

13
00:00:38,861 --> 00:00:43,120
president in this particular case,
the creative process, storytelling,

14
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:48,040
how they embrace it and developed it
within Pixar, the mistakes they've made,

15
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:50,410
what they've thrown out and much,

16
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,500
much more including the
lessons that he's learned,

17
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:58,120
the things he's observed working with
people like George Lucas and Steve Jobs.

18
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,210
Before we get to the interview,
two things that I like to provide.

19
00:01:01,211 --> 00:01:02,080
The first as a quote,

20
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:07,030
and this is from Harry
Truman and it is as follows.

21
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:11,350
It is amazing what you can accomplish
if you do not care who gets the credit.

22
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:15,700
And in fact, Ronald Reagan has very,
very similar quote to this effect.

23
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:19,840
The next is a Japanese proverb. Of
course, you know, I'm a Japanophile.

24
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:24,870
I used to live there and I love
sharing Cotto Aza or Japanese proverbs.

25
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:29,340
And there are many,
we talked about the Saudi Milky got,

26
00:01:29,341 --> 00:01:34,341
oh she did a few episodes back and
this time we have sheet on new shit.

27
00:01:34,811 --> 00:01:35,830
A Nigga hot,
okay,

28
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:39,820
she'd on noon is not knowing
God as a subject marker.

29
00:01:39,821 --> 00:01:43,540
Basically hotel can. So not knowing is
Buddha. What the hell does that mean?

30
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,640
She'd on new and got Hotel k means
ignorance is bliss or what you don't know

31
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:49,474
can't hurt you.

32
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:54,750
And the way that I interpreted this as
it applies to this particular episode,

33
00:01:54,761 --> 00:01:59,560
is sometimes to do the incredible,
you have to go in somewhat naive.

34
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,600
And if you knew what you
were getting yourself into,

35
00:02:01,601 --> 00:02:04,030
you probably wouldn't sign
up in the first place.

36
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:09,270
So beginner mind or being a novice or
jumping into the unknown can sometimes

37
00:02:09,401 --> 00:02:12,760
allow you to do what you would
otherwise be told that is impossible.

38
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:16,180
Without further ado,
I want to get us to the interview.

39
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,930

before my hands start shaking.

47
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:52,570
I'm a cybernetic organism living tissue.

48
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:00,150
Ed.

49
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:03,430
Thank you so much for joining me
today for a conversation. I hope.

50
00:03:03,431 --> 00:03:06,670
I hope you enjoy it and I've been looking
forward to it for quite some time.

51
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,083
Oh my pleasure.

52
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:13,260
This is a somewhat of a landmark moment
for me because I feel like destiny has

53
00:03:13,391 --> 00:03:18,190
had this in the cards. I remember 1995
very clearly for a lot of reasons,

54
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:23,490
but one of them was that I bought my
first ever share of stock and that was in

55
00:03:23,741 --> 00:03:24,640
Pixar.
Uh,

56
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,810
and it was also I guess the
last year of Calvin and Hobbes.

57
00:03:28,811 --> 00:03:30,610
So it was a very emotional year for me,

58
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:36,030
but I have been following Comic Book Art
Animation and Pixar for as long as I've

59
00:03:37,031 --> 00:03:40,350
known of it.
And of course as as cofounder,

60
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:45,360
you've had a a key role in creating a
lot of the stories that I can pretty much

61
00:03:46,331 --> 00:03:48,970
play back sort of frame by frame,
line by line.

62
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:52,030
And of course I'd like to talk about that,

63
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:55,150
but also creativity inc and
the book that you've put out,

64
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:58,390
which Forbes is said might just be
the best business book ever written,

65
00:03:58,391 --> 00:04:01,030
which is a very strong testimonial.

66
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:06,600
What I'd love to ask you
is perhaps starting with a
defining moment and maybe it

67
00:04:07,271 --> 00:04:11,440
wasn't a defining moment
when picks are went public,

68
00:04:11,441 --> 00:04:13,060
what did that feel like?

69
00:04:13,061 --> 00:04:17,140
Do you remember that day extremely
clearly or was it not a defining moment?

70
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:18,960
Well public,

71
00:04:18,961 --> 00:04:23,961
which was in 1995 was actually very
close to a number of other events that

72
00:04:24,451 --> 00:04:25,740
happened around the same time.

73
00:04:25,741 --> 00:04:30,390
So I look at it as a period of time
and for me it was a pivotal year,

74
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:34,710
but we went public one week
after the movie came out.

75
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:36,100
Right.
Very smart.

76
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:40,510
So, uh, Steve Jobs, the
logic was that, well,

77
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,200
he wanted us to go public and he had
some reasons for which we were skeptical

78
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:46,034
off,
to be honest,

79
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:50,200
but he wanted to do it after the film
came out to demonstrate to people that in

80
00:04:50,201 --> 00:04:53,530
fact in new art form was being born.
And that was right in investing in.

81
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:57,520
So the film came out,
it was a big success.

82
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:02,910
It was a success for me in the sense that
we had made a film and it wasn't just

83
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:05,380
a technical tour de force.

84
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,030
I never thought of this as we can
demonstrate technically we can do it,

85
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:13,450
but we actually wanted to make a real
honest to goodness complete film.

86
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,900
I'll just have that goal in mind.
And that's what we achieved.

87
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:22,480
It was also the culmination of
20 years of pursuing this dream.

88
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:28,780
So there is within the short period
of time, the culmination of 20 years,

89
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:32,530
the achieving of a goal going public.

90
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:38,070
Starting off on our next
film and the accident,

91
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,300
we began to think about two films,

92
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:45,550
the other being poor story to
having a relationship with Disney.

93
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,880
And while all this was going on,

94
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,850
hi personally felt a sense of loss.

95
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:57,010
And there was a curious one because
I had just achieved this goal.

96
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,990
The loss was in having achieved the goal.

97
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,270
I was now missing

98
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,550
one of the defining frameworks.

99
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:12,300
So I went through a period of a year of
trying to sort this out and I realized

100
00:06:12,341 --> 00:06:17,341
as I went through that year that there
were some really exciting things observed

101
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,420
along the way.

102
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:24,720
And one of them that I observed was that
most successful companies have this arc

103
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:29,110
where they rise.
And then with that success,

104
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:33,370
most of them fail, fail quickly.
But a lot of them, they take longer.

105
00:06:33,371 --> 00:06:38,050
But ultimately they fall apart.
And so the question was,

106
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,810
okay, how do you make it
so that it's sustainable?

107
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,500
Because the people that I knew
of who were in these companies,

108
00:06:44,501 --> 00:06:49,501
and I had a lot of friends in silicon
valley or smart and they were creative and

109
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:52,210
they were hardworking.

110
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:58,410
So whatever the problem was there was
actually leading them astray was really

111
00:06:59,351 --> 00:07:03,400
hard to see. And the implication
was that whatever that force was,

112
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:05,890
it would also apply to us at Pixar.

113
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:11,620
So this then became the interesting
question. These forces are at work,

114
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,470
can we find them before they do us in?

115
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:20,130
And so at the end of the earth that I
realized this is actually the next goal.

116
00:07:20,131 --> 00:07:22,520
It's not a film if,

117
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,750
how do we have an environment in
which we can find an address problems.

118
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,970
So, so that was the big thing that I
got in the year at a personal level.

119
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:35,780
There was another one also,
which was not in the book,

120
00:07:35,781 --> 00:07:39,620
but I will tell you about it because
it was a personal thing for me.

121
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:43,100
And that was when I was younger,

122
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:46,790
because I remember this thinking at some
point I want to be best in the world.

123
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:50,490
It's something, all right.
So this is a goal that I had.

124
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,860
So now it's 20 years later, the film
comes out and then I were successful.

125
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,700
And there are these phenomenal people
here. There are the technical people,

126
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:02,020
most of whom aren't well known.
But you've got Bill Reeve and Eben Osby,

127
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:07,160
he's liked out of that to help build
the technology. Uh, and besides, uh,

128
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,640
Jon laster and Steve Jobs,

129
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,890
there also is an understanding and Joe
ramped and Leon Creech and Pete docter

130
00:08:13,891 --> 00:08:15,780
and a whole bunch of
people were a part of this.

131
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:20,610
So now being part of this group
that had achieved something,

132
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:23,790
there was a question that I asked myself,

133
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:29,340
which I did admit to anybody at
the time. And that was, well,

134
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:32,400
all of this work of us were part of this,
but how much of it was me?

135
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,180
Right? So this is this
background question. So, well,

136
00:08:38,181 --> 00:08:40,410
I know I'm part of it
and I'm only part of it.

137
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:43,050
But how was critical was I to this,

138
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:47,730
and at the end of the year,
as the goal became clear,

139
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:52,440
I also realized that the question
was not a useful question.

140
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,220
And that in somehow trying to do that,
I was actually misleading myself.

141
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:00,481
Now,

142
00:09:00,481 --> 00:09:05,481
the only reason I bring this up was that
I now recognize that a lot of people

143
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,930
when they reach that place
where they're successful,

144
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,980
they ask that question and
most people won't admit it,

145
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:17,700
but they do ask the question and a lot
of people reach the wrong conclusion.

146
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:26,890
Well, what I believe is
that what we did together,

147
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:29,850
it was not something that
I can separate myself from.

148
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:33,460
And this is true of most enterprises.

149
00:09:33,461 --> 00:09:38,461
It's this desire to separate oneself out
is like asking for a clean answer to a

150
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:41,350
question when there is no clean answer.

151
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:46,360
And it is true of most of
the things in our lives,

152
00:09:46,361 --> 00:09:48,130
whether it's personal or business,

153
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:53,760
is that the inner connection between them
and the way they're all mixed together

154
00:09:54,161 --> 00:09:59,161
is inherently messy and confusing
and there aren't clear boundaries.

155
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:05,760
And the desire for complete
clarity actually leads one
away from addressing the

156
00:10:06,221 --> 00:10:07,480
mess that's in the mill

157
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:17,420
trader on Wall Street is said it's better
to be roughly correct than precisely

158
00:10:17,421 --> 00:10:18,050
wrong.

159
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:21,890
And it seems like that mess in the
middle is something that a lot of people

160
00:10:21,891 --> 00:10:26,090
strive to avoid. You. The, an
incredible technical pedigree.

161
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:29,870
And of course we could talk about the
Arba Group. We could talk about, uh,

162
00:10:29,871 --> 00:10:33,650
your work early on with all sorts
of technologies that then have,

163
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:37,850
have become standard technologies
in the use of animation,

164
00:10:37,851 --> 00:10:41,300
texture mapping and so on.
One of my close friends actually,

165
00:10:41,301 --> 00:10:44,180
who was a musician by training
ended up working at Pixar.

166
00:10:44,181 --> 00:10:47,210
I believe he's still there because he
wrote his thesis at Princeton about

167
00:10:47,211 --> 00:10:49,400
texture mapping of all
things and coded it himself.

168
00:10:49,401 --> 00:10:54,401
But what I'd love to get your thoughts
on is as someone who's exceptionally well

169
00:10:54,831 --> 00:10:56,810
trained in computer
science and engineering,

170
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:01,100
how did you take that precision of,
of thought,

171
00:11:01,101 --> 00:11:06,040
that logical approach to problem solving
and replicating issues and so on, which,

172
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:11,041
which I find translates into
many different areas and
apply it to storytelling.

173
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,620
And what is in your,

174
00:11:12,621 --> 00:11:16,160
in your current role and in previous
roles would have been your sort of key

175
00:11:16,161 --> 00:11:19,580
observations with how to apply framework.
And I'll,

176
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:24,260
and just one more comment that related
to my, my one and only tour of Pixar.

177
00:11:24,261 --> 00:11:25,810
I live in San Francisco and uh,

178
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:29,870
ended up having a friend of a friend who
was an engineer at Pixar besides rob,

179
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:34,580
my previous friend. And I was so
impressed by the process. I mean,

180
00:11:34,581 --> 00:11:37,880
you do have processes and it doesn't
mean everything has a home run.

181
00:11:37,881 --> 00:11:41,230
But I remember looking at
the color, sort of, uh, the,

182
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:45,020
the color coding of different
segments of the films.

183
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:47,840
And I had never observed it and it was,

184
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:52,610
it was so genius to me want to see it
laid out in front of me and that it was a

185
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:54,100
deliberate decision.
So

186
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,460
that's a mouthful that I just put out
there. But with an engineering mind,

187
00:11:57,461 --> 00:12:02,461
what have you observed about storytelling
and why can't other companies get it

188
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,740
right so consistently or people

189
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:12,890
three or four things through
responded. There is one of those.

190
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:17,810
It has to do with the relationship between
the precision of the science and then

191
00:12:17,811 --> 00:12:19,790
the r side for that.
I,

192
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:25,190
I go back to when I was growing up in
the 50s and a rather unique time and post

193
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:29,000
World War II,
but also a very safe time.

194
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,160
And as I was growing up,

195
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:36,140
my two people that I aspire to
follow with Walt Disney and,

196
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:41,000
and Albert Einstein, but for most of my
childhood, I want it to be an artist.

197
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:46,510
I wanted to be an animator and I studied
art and I did very well on arc in high

198
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:49,610
school and I also did
very well in physics.

199
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:55,220
But as I got to near the end of
high school and going into college,

200
00:12:55,910 --> 00:13:00,910
I didn't see the path to get to the
level of what the animators were at at

201
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:03,920
Disney. So when I went to college,
I switched over into physics.

202
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:10,040
Now the interesting thing to me is that
over the years I've actually told that

203
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:12,200
anecdote to people when I've given talks,

204
00:13:12,201 --> 00:13:16,010
how I said I switched over and I say
it rather abruptly like that when I was

205
00:13:16,011 --> 00:13:16,240
talking to,

206
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,700
I switched over to physics and usually
there's a kid or in the audience

207
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,583
sort of like hello,

208
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,260
that's an incongruous statement.

209
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:25,590
Right?

210
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:28,200
But then that caused me to
think about it. It's like, okay,

211
00:13:28,201 --> 00:13:30,650
why is that in Congress?

212
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:35,460
Because most people to this day think
of them as a so radically different from

213
00:13:35,461 --> 00:13:39,660
each other. But I want to pause
it a different way to look at it.

214
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:45,500
And it comes from I think what is a
fundamental misunderstanding of art on the

215
00:13:46,591 --> 00:13:48,090
part of most people.

216
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:54,000
Because I think of art as learning
to draw or it's an learning,

217
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:55,500
a certain kind of self expression.

218
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:59,370
But in fact what artists
do is they learn to see,

219
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:01,470
yeah,

220
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:05,400
the actual training is one of observation.
So now if you,

221
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:09,060
if you look at it from
that point I do is okay,

222
00:14:09,061 --> 00:14:12,180
so which are the professions in
which observations, not important,

223
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:13,620
how about doctors or

224
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:15,543
they're scientists.

225
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,990
You want the skills of observing.

226
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:25,150
And for me there are different
ways of looking at things.

227
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,670
And if you look at the storytelling side,

228
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:33,100
then the first realization I think
I understood this fairly early on,

229
00:14:33,101 --> 00:14:38,101
is that storytelling is
the way we communicate with
each other all the way from

230
00:14:38,501 --> 00:14:40,900
when you're reading to your
children when they're young.

231
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:46,830
But it's also the news magazines and the
movies and television and storytelling

232
00:14:48,281 --> 00:14:52,430
is a way we do things. But even
in higher, our good teachers,

233
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:56,750
the good teachers are telling us good
stories, their way of communicating,

234
00:14:56,751 --> 00:15:01,751
understanding and what our scientists
and biologists and neuroscientists trying

235
00:15:02,331 --> 00:15:03,164
to do.

236
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:08,420
They're trying to reach an understanding
and then they're trying to find ways of

237
00:15:08,421 --> 00:15:11,990
communicating that
understanding to other people.

238
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:17,140
These are all different elements of the
way we communicate with each other. And,

239
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:20,120
and it's even stronger than most
people think. Because if you,

240
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:23,960
if you take something complicated
like making a movie as an example.

241
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,450
So you've got a few hundred people working
on a movie, like it can be toy story,

242
00:15:29,451 --> 00:15:32,870
but it can be more recent films.
Well,

243
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:35,880
what is the story of the
making of the film? Well,

244
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:40,280
it turns out it's too complicated to tell.
Nobody writes that story down.

245
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:45,850
And if you wrote down all the complexities
of what it took to do any one of

246
00:15:45,921 --> 00:15:48,170
these major complexities,

247
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:52,790
that fullstory is too boring.
It's too long.

248
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:57,791
So what do you do when you tell a story
but you edit it down and you simplify

249
00:15:58,191 --> 00:15:59,024
it?

250
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:04,810
So you simplify in order to convey
certain of the ideas that are critical.

251
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:08,000
But you can't capture all of them.

252
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:13,660
So you end up with a kind of mythology
and mythology is a way of us teaching

253
00:16:14,091 --> 00:16:15,650
basic principles to each other.

254
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:19,550
But then the theologies don't capture
everything and they never can.

255
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:26,480
So we are in a continual state of
trying to create our own mythologies.

256
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,180
And even when we come up with mythology,

257
00:16:29,181 --> 00:16:34,181
like the things we did on toy story
to the people who are here at Pixar,

258
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:38,120
a lot of them weren't here
when we made towards story too.

259
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:43,400
So the pivotal experiences that are there,
which are part of our history,

260
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,400
we're not experienced by a lot
of the people who are here.

261
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:52,100
And you can't actually pass that on as
a story because then begins to take on,

262
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:56,360
you'd like,
it fades over time to a pithy essence.

263
00:16:56,361 --> 00:16:57,980
But in along there's a personal thing.

264
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:04,350
So what you want is a new crisis
and in solving the new crisis,

265
00:17:05,841 --> 00:17:07,460
which they experience,

266
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:12,740
then they get something different than
they can get by hearing about somebody

267
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:13,574
else's story.

268
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:19,420
So we have a combination
of both storytelling and
experiencing and we need both

269
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:29,330
organically appear in the making of
every movie or are they things that you

270
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:35,030
deliberately bring to a
head or manufacturer in some
way to galvanize the troops

271
00:17:36,481 --> 00:17:39,270
and and spur creativity?

272
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,960
Well, I think in order
for them to be successful,

273
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:44,940
they essentially need to be organic.

274
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:50,190
So if you manufacture a crisis and
you can, is somewhat obviously,

275
00:17:50,191 --> 00:17:54,330
because like you said it budget or
you set a schedule for instance,

276
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:59,220
and it's very difficult then to some
extent you are creating a crisis.

277
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:04,320
But even that's a little artificial
because the fact is if you don't meet the

278
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:07,220
schedule or can we meet the budget,
you have a different crisis, right?

279
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:13,280
So what you want are the kinds of crises
that arise out of the thing that you're

280
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:18,510
doing, but, but you don't
artificially generated.

281
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:23,940
So I don't think of setting a budget or
a schedule as an artificial generation

282
00:18:23,941 --> 00:18:24,774
of a crisis.

283
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:30,510
But if we have a surprise that happens
because things never go according to plan,

284
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,210
then what you wanted to do was use the
problem that's there as a way of getting

285
00:18:36,211 --> 00:18:37,140
you as a group.

286
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,700
The forced the change in the process or
is to figure out problems in order to

287
00:18:41,701 --> 00:18:43,500
solve it.
And in doing so,

288
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:48,950
it becomes a combined joint effort to
move everybody forward and everybody has

289
00:18:49,531 --> 00:18:50,364
ownership in it.

290
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:59,270
Joseph Campbell's hero's
journey or the hero.

291
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:03,730
Are there any other books or
resources besides your own? Of course,

292
00:19:03,731 --> 00:19:08,731
which I would recommend everybody that
people can use to learn about mythology

293
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:15,010
or these sort of archetypal structures
to aid them in developing their own

294
00:19:15,011 --> 00:19:16,480
ability to tell stories.

295
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,720
Are there any other books or resources
that come to mind as being particularly

296
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,313
outstanding?

297
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:24,800
Okay.

298
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,820
Or people,
yeah.

299
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:30,090
Yeah. It's fairly broad because I've been
influenced by so many people in so many

300
00:19:30,091 --> 00:19:34,530
different things. I will say one thing
that I did, which was informative,

301
00:19:34,531 --> 00:19:36,180
but in ways that are hard to articulate.

302
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,050
You came from this thing and
just my brain works differently.

303
00:19:40,051 --> 00:19:43,410
It turns out I am unable to read poetry.

304
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:44,770
No kidding.

305
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:48,340
Because reading poetry within a
few seconds shuts my brain down.

306
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,173
Okay,

307
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:55,480
well it was just differences that
what I was actually describing this to

308
00:19:55,481 --> 00:19:59,110
somebody, this is many
years ago. And they said,

309
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,990
well don't read it,
listen to it.

310
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:06,400
And then all this came about because there
was a new translation of the Iliad by

311
00:20:06,401 --> 00:20:08,920
Thomas Fagles and it was in verse form.

312
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,310
So the thing is I couldn't read it.

313
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:16,750
So this woman at a dinner said,
well don't read it, listen to it.

314
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:22,230
So I bought the Cape and I listened to
it and I found that I was completely

315
00:20:23,471 --> 00:20:24,610
enthralled with it.

316
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:30,610
And then I was surprised by the fact
that here's a story that was orally

317
00:20:30,611 --> 00:20:35,500
transmitted 2,800 years ago in a
different language to a different culture.

318
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:39,850
And it was meant for oral
transmission of course,

319
00:20:39,851 --> 00:20:42,010
cause they have kind of that rhythm to it.

320
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:46,810
But now translated all these
years later into English,

321
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:52,120
the fact that I have this oral nature to
it still worked and captivated me and I

322
00:20:52,121 --> 00:20:56,110
was able to enjoy and pull in
this entire story. So that,

323
00:20:56,111 --> 00:20:57,700
so that got me started down this path.

324
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:02,170
So what I did was I then started listening
to these lectures from the teaching

325
00:21:02,171 --> 00:21:06,520
company and they have these
absolutely marvelous lecturers.

326
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:12,150
So what I did was I tried to listen
to lectures of all of human history.

327
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:17,620
So there's ancient Egypt and
Mesopotamia and Israel in China,

328
00:21:17,621 --> 00:21:19,460
on India,
uh,

329
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:24,070
and going up through the Roman era,
through the dark ages,

330
00:21:24,071 --> 00:21:27,760
the Middle Ages, the
renaissance. It took a few years.

331
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:30,490
So every day in the car
I would listen to this,

332
00:21:30,491 --> 00:21:35,080
but I felt like I had this
grants sweep of history.

333
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,850
Now at some level it's all pretty high
level because it's listening to the

334
00:21:39,851 --> 00:21:40,780
lectures and the car,

335
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:41,723
right?

336
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:46,480
But there was something about that which
gave me a sense which I loved and it

337
00:21:46,481 --> 00:21:49,720
gave me a different feeling about
people and how things relate,

338
00:21:49,721 --> 00:21:52,090
like to each other.
So that was one level of things.

339
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:57,040
The second is there are like the wisdom
books out of various traditions and

340
00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:02,070
China and India and meditation and things
coming out of Greece and Israel and so

341
00:22:03,851 --> 00:22:07,990
forth. And somehow reading all of those.
And the way people rest of those things,

342
00:22:07,991 --> 00:22:11,680
which are the foundations of our culture.
I found informative.

343
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,960
The what type of,

344
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:29,070
you take all of those and say, okay,
there's something about a breath.

345
00:22:29,071 --> 00:22:30,370
So I don't try to grab one of them.

346
00:22:30,371 --> 00:22:35,371
I try to get some breadth there because
I do believe that we are better off if

347
00:22:35,471 --> 00:22:38,590
we experience wide breath.
That's what a general education is.

348
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,910
And then there's some point
at which we dive really deep

349
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:46,870
and some of you will want to specialize.
Like I just want to do this,

350
00:22:46,871 --> 00:22:50,170
I just want to be an artist so I
just want to be a scientist so forth.

351
00:22:50,171 --> 00:22:55,171
So I understand that and there's an
experience of diving deep into something

352
00:22:55,511 --> 00:22:57,340
which is indescribable.

353
00:22:57,341 --> 00:23:02,341
So it's good to have that experience and
I think one has to breath that you need

354
00:23:02,441 --> 00:23:06,790
a combination of the two and once you
experienced the depth in something,

355
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:09,940
you're actually in a better
position to go deeper into an area.

356
00:23:09,941 --> 00:23:12,070
Once you've discovered
what your area of love is,

357
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,730
then there's the more monitoring in
terms of neuroscience and how we work.

358
00:23:16,731 --> 00:23:21,731
And then the other is just the observation
of if you look at what took place in

359
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:26,470
in silicon valley and continues to
take place in Silicon Valley and in San

360
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:30,610
Francisco and the rise and the fall of
the companies and the way they interact

361
00:23:30,611 --> 00:23:33,160
and the amazing things that happened
in the bad things can happen.

362
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:38,940
That human drama I find very interesting
and we're kind of in the middle of it.

363
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,553
Absolutely.

364
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:46,340
That's cool.
How do you look at the mess that we,

365
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,080
that we're in and the
good things that we're in?

366
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,560
Moved to the bay area,

367
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:55,460
up to San Francisco from the
peninsula was because of that,

368
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:00,430
that chaos chaos.
You mentioned specialization.

369
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:05,320
When you've obviously done a lot of
work with George Lucas and Steve Jobs,

370
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:09,400
do you view them as generalists,

371
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,980
specialists or both?

372
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:15,290
What were some of the key
habits or routines, rituals,

373
00:24:15,291 --> 00:24:18,320
anything that either of them had
that that still stick in your memory?

374
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,313
Well,

375
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:24,820
what was particularly
interesting there is the,

376
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:28,540
while he was a successful filmmaker,
he,

377
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:30,730
even though he was not a technical person,

378
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:35,530
he viewed and believed whose core
the technology was going to change.

379
00:24:35,531 --> 00:24:36,820
The art of filmmaking.

380
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:40,660
So with the success that
he had it with star wars,

381
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:45,550
he was willing to do something that was
not done anywhere else in the industry.

382
00:24:45,551 --> 00:24:49,090
So he was the sole person
that did this and he said,

383
00:24:49,091 --> 00:24:52,810
I'm going to invest in bringing
technology into filmmaking.

384
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:56,890
And so that meant not
only graphics and uh,

385
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:01,660
but also meant a digital audio
and video editing. So I'm not,

386
00:25:01,661 --> 00:25:05,170
was fortunate to be connected
with George at that time,

387
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,240
but he was unique in this.

388
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,670
Why do you think he decided that?

389
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:16,830
Where it seemed to be lacking in
other people? What allowed him,

390
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,810
well,
I think the thing that triggered him,

391
00:25:19,811 --> 00:25:22,700
and it's not that he ever told
me exactly what the trigger was,

392
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:26,060
but in the making of star wars,

393
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,720
it required the best use of the advanced
state of the art of special effects at

394
00:25:33,561 --> 00:25:36,470
that time.
And there were two parts to that.

395
00:25:36,471 --> 00:25:41,270
One was the precision control of optical
printing and blue screen matting.

396
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:46,160
So this is an optical process and required
a great deal of technical skill on

397
00:25:46,161 --> 00:25:50,150
the part of the people who were there.
And the second thing,

398
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:53,720
which was a new idea for star wars,

399
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:58,750
but what's critical for effects
whenever appreciates this, but it was I,

400
00:25:58,751 --> 00:26:03,751
one of the breakthroughs for the film
is that it's important to have objects

401
00:26:04,341 --> 00:26:06,380
blurred in the direction of motion.

402
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,390
Oh, interesting. That makes perfect sense.

403
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:14,450
Okay. And if it doesn't happen because
of the way the projection systems work,

404
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,720
then I picks it up and we
actually see a double image,

405
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:21,110
but we're not conscious of it, but we're
conscious of it if something is wrong.

406
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:28,060
So what they did was they had a technical
group that moved the spaceships while

407
00:26:28,881 --> 00:26:29,840
the shutter was open.

408
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:35,450
So they captured the blur on
the blue screen matting film,

409
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:41,140
and then with great precision work to
keep that blur of these space ships as

410
00:26:42,021 --> 00:26:46,830
they then mad at the objects together.
So this was for the time,

411
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:51,210
very high level technical skill. And
then star wars is this enormous success.

412
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:57,090
And George realized that technical
expertise there was rot in by this amazing

413
00:26:57,091 --> 00:27:01,740
group of people was one of the things
that helped elevate this cell and put it

414
00:27:01,741 --> 00:27:05,370
into a different category. So
with asked success, he said, well,

415
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,020
let's keep going down this path.

416
00:27:07,021 --> 00:27:12,021
How far can we go because of that world
outside there is continuing to change.

417
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:17,550
Now what's different about George was
he made that little leap or big leap.

418
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,793
Okay.

419
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:23,710
From saying technology was a
key part of this is saying, oh,

420
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:25,930
that world outside is still changing.

421
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:30,250
I'm going to be part of it and
try to incorporate it. All right.

422
00:27:30,251 --> 00:27:34,600
So that was why he was that way. I don't
know. But he was the guy that did it.

423
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:41,600
Tuxedo park who was an amateur scientist,

424
00:27:41,601 --> 00:27:45,440
but he took interest in radio and uh,

425
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:50,470
later had a huge impact on detecting
you votes and whatnot in the war itself.

426
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,610
Did George and Steve have anything
in common or much in common?

427
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,380
Well, I mean they were
quite different. I mean,

428
00:27:58,381 --> 00:27:59,550
they're very different from each other.

429
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:04,200
Steve was an extraordinary person and
I wrote him about him at the end of the

430
00:28:04,201 --> 00:28:06,810
book. But there, I allude
to him throughout the book.

431
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,180
But there was something there,

432
00:28:09,181 --> 00:28:13,260
which I find a stressing because I
watched the arc of Steve over his life.

433
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:19,220
And the image of Steve that people know
publicly about the way he worked was

434
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,980
from when he was younger and I wouldn't,
some of those behaviors,

435
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:25,890
and a lot of them weren't
nice at that time,

436
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:31,860
but as a result of being cast out of
apple and starting next and then buying

437
00:28:31,861 --> 00:28:36,600
Pixar from Lucas Salomon and
being part of starting up Pixar,

438
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,920
Steve who was so incredibly intelligent,
he actually,

439
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:46,010
he just figured out that some of those
things he did in the past didn't work and

440
00:28:46,051 --> 00:28:51,051
he changed his behavior and he became a
more empathetic person and he changed in

441
00:28:52,061 --> 00:28:53,460
the way that he dealt with them.

442
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:59,540
Now what the outside world sees is the
mythology of the young Steve and then

443
00:28:59,581 --> 00:28:59,970
this,

444
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:04,970
all of a sudden this gigantic success
of apple and then the iPhone and they

445
00:29:05,851 --> 00:29:06,990
connect the two together,

446
00:29:06,991 --> 00:29:11,400
but they didn't realize the arc that
Steve went through. Why did they miss it?

447
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:17,300
And the reason they missed it was that
once Steve went through this change in

448
00:29:17,301 --> 00:29:19,730
his life, when he figured
this out about 15 years ago,

449
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:25,280
then basically everybody that knew Steve
stayed with Steve for the rest of his

450
00:29:25,281 --> 00:29:29,600
life. Right? So we all
witnessed that part of Steve.

451
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:33,260
He was always an intelligent
and incisive and what he did.

452
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:36,560
But his way of working
with people changed.

453
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:42,610
So when it came to the mythologizing
about Steve and would call me from since

454
00:29:43,471 --> 00:29:44,770
then to talk about them all,

455
00:29:44,771 --> 00:29:48,520
I was not going to psychoanalyze Steve
Ali was alive. Right? And nobody would.

456
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,190
So our boss,
our friends,

457
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:59,400
so Steve, my friend is, I mean at
the end, it wasn't actually my boss,

458
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:00,990
he was on the board of
directors at Disney,

459
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:05,790
but for all those years afterwards
that he still checking all the time and

460
00:30:05,791 --> 00:30:10,170
talked and he had this passionate
interest and it was going on and he was a

461
00:30:10,171 --> 00:30:11,740
caring person.
You know,

462
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,800
when I was in the hospital with my hips
being replaced and they were Steven

463
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:18,900
there visiting and checking up and
wanting to make sure that had the best

464
00:30:18,901 --> 00:30:19,621
medical help.

465
00:30:19,621 --> 00:30:24,621
And so that image of Steve was not
conveyed to people because the people that

466
00:30:25,441 --> 00:30:27,350
knew about them viewed in,
there's just,

467
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,260
what's their private relationship
with Steve? So we talked about it,

468
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:32,263
right?

469
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:36,380
So the mythology about Steve was
actually a mixture of things when that

470
00:30:36,381 --> 00:30:39,840
recognizing that as in,

471
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:43,460
as you're pointing out in Campbell's book,
there was this hero's journey, right?

472
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,930
And Steve went through that
journey and by the end of his life,

473
00:30:47,931 --> 00:30:50,090
he was a very different person
than he wasn't the first.

474
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:01,490
What were the reasons for that?
People were skeptical of that. He had,

475
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,560
well, okay, so we're,

476
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:08,610
we're now making the first film and to
then become a public company for the rest

477
00:31:09,981 --> 00:31:13,070
of us because none of us had ever been,
even in a public company,

478
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:16,370
let alone knowing what it means.
It's like this can be a major distraction.

479
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:21,260
And you guys stories about, well,
okay, what does Wall Street expect?

480
00:31:21,261 --> 00:31:25,370
Does this actually kind of mislead you
into the wrong direction so you have the

481
00:31:25,371 --> 00:31:29,750
wrong values in place?
So there was the view of what,

482
00:31:29,751 --> 00:31:33,530
let's make some films and prove our worth
and get that under our belt before we

483
00:31:33,531 --> 00:31:37,670
go public. But Steve had a
different logic. He said,

484
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:42,700
right now we have a three picture deal
with Disney and the financial terms of

485
00:31:45,441 --> 00:31:46,274
the deal.

486
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:50,360
While they were as good as we could
have gotten under the circumstances,

487
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:52,430
once we're a successful company,

488
00:31:52,431 --> 00:31:54,890
then our share of the profits
were actually pretty small.

489
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,560
So Steve wanted to renegotiate the deal,

490
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:04,580
although he had and always had a
very good relationship with Disney.

491
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,930
But Steve said at the end of three years,

492
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:12,970
if we then split off as a separate
company and we're no longer with Disney,

493
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,750
we will be their worst nightmare.

494
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:17,750
Yeah.
Have

495
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:20,970
they will have helped launch
a successful competitor.

496
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:26,970
So what will happen is that
when toy story comes out,

497
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:30,900
all of this is before it happens. So
we're, we're guessing about scams,

498
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:35,000
but this is Steve prognosticating because
he now believes that film's going to

499
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:39,590
be a big success. So he said what will
happen is as soon as the film is, is out,

500
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:44,690
that Michael Eisner, we'll realize
that he's helped create a competitor.

501
00:32:44,691 --> 00:32:46,790
So he will want to renegotiate.

502
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,760
And if we renegotiate,

503
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:54,810
then what we want is to be 50 50 partners,

504
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:58,580
I should say right there.
That's a different Steve.

505
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:02,550
Then years before were years where Steve
of shot for the fences and try to get

506
00:33:02,551 --> 00:33:03,750
almost everything for himself.

507
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,860
He now has reached the point we
said that's not a good place to be.

508
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,370
A good place to be is a 50 50 partnership.

509
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:16,560
So it's like a good standing
and it's a high road to pay.

510
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,320
But if we're 50 50 partners,

511
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:24,060
it also means that we have to
put up half the money. Well,

512
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:28,970
Pixar doesn't have any,
so we need a war chest.

513
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:32,840
So if we go public,
we will get a war chest.

514
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:35,450
Then when we would negotiate,

515
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:38,750
we can come in and go
for the kind of deal,

516
00:33:38,751 --> 00:33:40,520
which is a 50 50 deal.

517
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:45,350
So the film came out and within
a few months it's the route,

518
00:33:45,351 --> 00:33:49,820
the call from Mike saying, let's
renegotiate. And so c says,

519
00:33:49,821 --> 00:33:50,480
okay,

520
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:55,480
we want it to be 50 50 and all of that
happened as Steve predicted it would.

521
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:59,330
And for me it was rather amazing.
Wow.

522
00:33:59,331 --> 00:34:04,331
He's completely called it correctly and
it was coming from a place of the high

523
00:34:06,201 --> 00:34:10,100
ground of a true partnership. That's
the way he wanted to think about it.

524
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:11,680
It's a more sustainable structure

525
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,930
all the years.

526
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:17,840
He ultimately had trouble with Eisner
but it's because he didn't think the eyes

527
00:34:17,841 --> 00:34:22,480
and was I partner with him.
Well you know,

528
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:26,740
it had to do with certain things that I
was nervous said about in the public and

529
00:34:26,741 --> 00:34:28,900
so forth and about Disney and so forth.

530
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:34,000
You just didn't feel like it was a partner
relationship you would expect and at

531
00:34:34,421 --> 00:34:36,310
this time Steve had doubt,

532
00:34:36,311 --> 00:34:41,311
place value on equitable partnerships
and there was a value he brought to the

533
00:34:41,771 --> 00:34:45,130
table and in bringing that,

534
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:48,250
because it was a value was
actually when we could hang onto,

535
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:53,850
but he was always very careful to say
Disney itself as a corporation is one that

536
00:34:54,911 --> 00:34:58,930
we really admire. They've done a
great job of marketing our films.

537
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:02,410
They've done a fantastic job
with the parks and so forth.

538
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:04,360
So through all of this,

539
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:09,160
he worked very hard to keep
a great relationship with
Disney because he believed

540
00:35:09,161 --> 00:35:13,210
in the end that it was going
to lead to something good.

541
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:16,840
No guarantees.
Mc was always realistic about that.

542
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:20,670
But he believed that if we behave well
with them as partners, that would,

543
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,090
we would end up in the right place.

544
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:32,040
I think people would look at Steve or
they oftentimes we look at Pixar and say,

545
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:35,420
well my God, they're batting a thousand.
They've always gotten it right.

546
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:39,120
What I'd love to you
is sort of a two part,

547
00:35:39,121 --> 00:35:41,370
it won't be one of my
eight parts questions,

548
00:35:41,371 --> 00:35:46,320
but what was the hardest film for you
to make and why? And then secondly,

549
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:48,420
related to George Lucas. Uh, I've,

550
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:53,010
I've heard on numerous accounts that he
was hospitalized at least once during

551
00:35:53,011 --> 00:35:55,300
the making of star wars with,
you know, and he was, I mean,

552
00:35:55,301 --> 00:35:56,740
a really young guy at the time,

553
00:35:56,741 --> 00:36:00,180
but it was just from overexertion
and panic attacks and whatnot.

554
00:36:00,181 --> 00:36:01,290
That's at least what I've heard.

555
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:03,240
Which has been the hardest
for you to make and why?

556
00:36:03,241 --> 00:36:06,960
And then do you think for a film
to truly be a landmark film,

557
00:36:06,961 --> 00:36:11,430
that it is necessary for at least one
person to make a sacrifice of that

558
00:36:11,431 --> 00:36:15,270
magnitude where they just are at the
brink of falling to pieces or not?

559
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:22,730
I wasn't here for star wars for whatever
was called the first star wars. In fact,

560
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,160
I never heard that. So I don't
know whether it was true or false.

561
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:30,570
I just didn't hear so I don't know.
But the bigger question is like,

562
00:36:30,571 --> 00:36:34,560
which is the hardest?
They do vary in their hardness.

563
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,950
I would say there have been several,

564
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,960
which were extremely difficult
and some were only difficult.

565
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:44,150
Right?

566
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:46,950
I think originally we thought,
well, if you do SQL, it's
easier, but we send it out.

567
00:36:46,951 --> 00:36:48,680
If you're going to do something original,
it's always hard.

568
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:52,860
Right. I would imagine more
difficult in some ways.

569
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:55,610
Yeah, because you have to take them
in a different place and you're,

570
00:36:55,611 --> 00:36:57,830
you're constrained by the
certain world that you've got,

571
00:36:57,831 --> 00:37:02,831
but you're expected to add something
in terms of that world that really is

572
00:37:03,561 --> 00:37:05,150
interesting.
And not obvious.

573
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:11,080
So the only thing that makes a film hard
is if you keep going at it and it's not

574
00:37:11,391 --> 00:37:13,970
working.
So you can't solve the problems.

575
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:17,420
And then what happens
is for all directors,

576
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:22,910
they are emotionally invested in their
films and they also get lost in them

577
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,860
having us, everybody, it
doesn't matter who they are,

578
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,680
whether they're new or
whether their experience.

579
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:32,300
And what we have found is that
since it happens to all of them,

580
00:37:32,301 --> 00:37:36,860
what you want is this collection of
people, we call it the brain trust.

581
00:37:36,861 --> 00:37:41,861
But essentially it's a group of colleagues
who have been through it to help

582
00:37:43,881 --> 00:37:48,881
navigate when you're kind of lost in
this swirling mass because it's very

583
00:37:49,491 --> 00:37:50,324
difficult.

584
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:55,070
And so the most difficult thing
is on the people themselves.

585
00:37:55,130 --> 00:38:00,130
And we've had some films
where the original director
who had the idea got lost

586
00:38:01,401 --> 00:38:02,690
in it and couldn't get out.

587
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:08,450
And so we had to make some changes
in order to get the film done.

588
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:12,920
So in our view, we've had
failures, but we basically,

589
00:38:12,921 --> 00:38:15,730
we tried to keep the failures inside.

590
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:18,020
And it's not that they're
secret that we've had failures,

591
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:23,510
but we don't release the film that fails.
We will abandon it all.

592
00:38:23,511 --> 00:38:27,980
We'll restart and we've had several
restarts. We just get a state,

593
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:32,990
it's not working. We have to do a major
rethink to get this to be where it is.

594
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:35,410
So we had to do that with toy story
and we had there the Ratatouille.

595
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,540
Wow. No kidding. I've seen Reddit's,

596
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,390
I've seen both of those
movies dozens of times.

597
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:43,220
At what point do you stop trying
to fix something and abandoned it?

598
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:47,250
Are there cases of total abandonment
and in which case or shelving something

599
00:38:47,251 --> 00:38:48,240
permanently,
in which case,

600
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:53,690
how do you decide to go completely
scorched earth blank slate as opposed to

601
00:38:53,881 --> 00:38:56,430
reworking something if that's been done,
I don't know.

602
00:38:56,930 --> 00:39:00,890
Well usually there's a buildup to,
this says all of our films to begin with,

603
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:06,770
really rough

604
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:15,440
that people have is that a new film was
like the baby version of the final film

605
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:19,650
when in fact sometimes the final film
bears no relationship to what you started

606
00:39:19,651 --> 00:39:24,300
off with. And what we found is
that first version always sucks.

607
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:29,310
And I don't mean this because I'm self
effacing or that were modest about it.

608
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:32,160
I immediate in the sense
that they really do, sorry,

609
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:37,670
the storyboarding level or what? How
is it appearing? What's the form?

610
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:39,751
Yeah,

611
00:39:39,751 --> 00:39:42,850
you're going through phases of where
we come with the idea that you pitched.

612
00:39:42,851 --> 00:39:44,400
The idea is you rework them.

613
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:48,180
Then you'll do a strep and
you have a script read,

614
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:52,620
have actors read through it and then you
go through a couple of versions of that

615
00:39:52,621 --> 00:39:57,600
and then you start to storyboard of the
APP and you put it up and it isn't until

616
00:39:57,601 --> 00:40:02,280
you get to, you know if Q versions
in that you begin to find,

617
00:40:02,281 --> 00:40:07,280
okay, these elements of it are
sticking their holding. We, we've now,

618
00:40:07,281 --> 00:40:10,710
I've got the tent poles for the
film that we can build around,

619
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:16,080
but it's a discovery process now and the
reason it takes long as you're trying

620
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:20,970
to do something that's new.
If we just want to throw up a story,

621
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:24,000
it turns out we know how to do that
really quickly and we know how to make it

622
00:40:24,001 --> 00:40:24,834
quickly.

623
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:30,420
But it's not a good movie unless you
can try to find some way of touching

624
00:40:30,421 --> 00:40:33,570
people's emotions are bringing
something new to the story.

625
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:39,090
So the reason we go out on field trips
and do an research trips is that we're

626
00:40:39,091 --> 00:40:44,091
trying to take ourselves and our
directors into a place where they bring

627
00:40:45,241 --> 00:40:48,900
something that they didn't know or in
the general audience wouldn't know.

628
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:50,821
And I mean I'll,

629
00:40:50,821 --> 00:40:55,821
I'll use an example as ratatouille
where the filmmakers went to into the,

630
00:40:56,790 --> 00:41:00,600
the three star restaurants in France
and the one to Thomas Keller's French

631
00:41:00,601 --> 00:41:04,060
laundry and so forth. Now a lot of
people watching the cooking channel,

632
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:07,700
but the cooking channel is not
like a real, the inside of a real,

633
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:10,140
okay.

634
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:14,070
The thing is almost nobody has been
inside of a real high end restaurant,

635
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:16,290
so they don't actually know
what goes on inside there.

636
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:23,150
So when we take elements of the way they
work in the audience and we put them in

637
00:41:23,461 --> 00:41:25,230
the Ratatouille as elements,

638
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:29,550
then the audience does know whether they
are true or not because they haven't

639
00:41:29,551 --> 00:41:32,550
been there.
But they sense that it is.

640
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:36,770
So when you're watching
those people in that kitchen,

641
00:41:36,771 --> 00:41:39,200
the way they're working in
and the way she's talking,

642
00:41:39,201 --> 00:41:43,190
cause he was teaching him how to
cook, right? You have the sense like,

643
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:46,510
oh this is real and you,

644
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:50,990
you only get that by going out into the
world and finding something new and then

645
00:41:50,991 --> 00:41:55,610
you bring that in. Then you have to
Meld it into a story and it's a long,

646
00:41:55,611 --> 00:41:59,390
slow, painful process and involves
a lot of people and a lot of time.

647
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:03,250
So now the question is, or what
your question was like, you know,

648
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:07,610
what do you do if you abandoned it
or restart? How'd you do that? Okay.

649
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:09,050
In our history here,

650
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:14,080
we have only abandoned one film if the
other ones will either that evolved into

651
00:42:14,271 --> 00:42:19,271
what they were or we did a restart
and the one that we abandon,

652
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:22,820
the only reason we
abandoned it is that we,

653
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:25,220
we realized we needed
to bring fresh blood in.

654
00:42:25,221 --> 00:42:29,720
And so the person we brought in said,
yes, I will do a restart on the film,

655
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:34,790
but essentially we're restarting. I have
an idea, which I think is even better,

656
00:42:34,791 --> 00:42:38,510
which is a completely different idea.
And when he pitched that idea, we said,

657
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:41,720
you're absolutely right.
That's a brilliant idea.

658
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:43,013
What movie?

659
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:45,280
This is the one that's
coming out next to him.

660
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:48,773
Okay.

661
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,480
So rather than being a restart,
it was say, okay, this is,

662
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:53,950
this is the film you're going to do.

663
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:56,800
So because we believe that
it was a brilliant idea,

664
00:42:57,850 --> 00:43:02,050
but for the others it was a restart.
If you compare it with baseball,

665
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:06,580
like baseball has got this notion that
you got the starting pitcher and then

666
00:43:06,581 --> 00:43:08,800
you've got through the really
version and you've got the finisher.

667
00:43:08,801 --> 00:43:12,970
So you've got multiple pitchers
in the game. So there's an ideal.

668
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:15,730
And the ideal is that you'd
like to pitch the perfect game.

669
00:43:15,731 --> 00:43:20,731
So one guy takes it all the way through
the game and finishes up other wind.

670
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:25,840
So that's the ideal. But the
ideal use, it rarely happens.

671
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:31,510
The concept which we accept is there
multiple people that do it. Not In film.

672
00:43:31,511 --> 00:43:36,160
When we do something, we have someone
who starts it, but their idea,

673
00:43:36,161 --> 00:43:38,920
which is to take all the way through.
If they don't take all the way through,

674
00:43:38,921 --> 00:43:41,410
then they think of
themselves as having failed.

675
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:42,350
Right?

676
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:46,070
You step back and say,
you know they launched the idea,

677
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:47,570
they had a good idea,

678
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:51,200
they couldn't see any shit cause it's a
different kind of thing when you finish

679
00:43:51,201 --> 00:43:52,040
and when you start

680
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:57,770
the value of the world is it frequently
you the value the first person and you

681
00:43:57,830 --> 00:43:59,510
give high value to the second person.

682
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:04,460
But the reality is it's kind of all parked
together and you have to acknowledge

683
00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:09,260
the fact that the contributions came from
a lot of people over a great length of

684
00:44:09,261 --> 00:44:12,590
time. And it's what makes it
painful is it in this world,

685
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:14,960
if you have to make that change,

686
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:20,150
it's a personal thing that somebody
has and that's where the pain comes.

687
00:44:20,151 --> 00:44:20,984
It's not the work.

688
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:31,860
Rapid fire questions.

689
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:36,690
Okay. That a very short form. You can
answer them as briefly as you'd like.

690
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:38,340
And uh,

691
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:43,460
the first of that is what is the book
you've given most often as a gift?

692
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:46,440
The books I've given most often.

693
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,480
I wouldn't say there is a single one.

694
00:44:56,110 --> 00:45:00,580
Okay, got it. Is there any that you've
given more multiple times than others?

695
00:45:01,090 --> 00:45:01,490
No,
I,

696
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:05,940
I would say there are certain children's
books which I've given out a few times.

697
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:09,630
One monster after another by Mercer Meyer.

698
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:12,120
That's terrific. I love that. Perfect.

699
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:15,960
What is your favorite documentary
or any favorite documentaries?

700
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,590
All the documentaries, you
know, he used to go to Sundance.

701
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:23,260
I love documentaries is,
or favor one though.

702
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:27,520
Honestly I can't remember
a favor one for me.

703
00:45:27,521 --> 00:45:31,960
The documentary gives us a slice and
something we don't see. And so I actually,

704
00:45:31,961 --> 00:45:34,980
I liked them as a class. I've
been so busy. The last couple

705
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:36,933
problem,

706
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:38,400
many recently.

707
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:42,840
Are there
any that stick out in your mind?

708
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:48,010
Well, for me personally, there
it is. They'll have a range
of things, similar video,

709
00:45:48,011 --> 00:45:49,750
they're science oriented and so forth.

710
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:53,470
They've got them on economics
and on Shakespeare and so forth,

711
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:58,270
but the thing that had the greatest
impact on me was the set of them,

712
00:45:58,271 --> 00:46:00,850
which was the whole
sweep of world history.

713
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:04,390
You have to take it like
section at a time to do it.

714
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:09,160
Although I must admit there was one which
was around the time of King Henry the

715
00:46:09,161 --> 00:46:12,220
eighth there's that,
the tutors and the stewards.

716
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:15,790
I was so blown away with that
that as soon as I listened to it,

717
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:20,060
I listened to it again.
The tutors and the stewards,

718
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:22,400
that particular one,

719
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:23,420
I'll have to check that out.

720
00:46:25,030 --> 00:46:28,220
There's a podcast that
only three months or so,

721
00:46:28,221 --> 00:46:30,050
three to four months
called hardcore history,

722
00:46:30,051 --> 00:46:35,030
and there's a series called the
wrath of the cons, which I highly,

723
00:46:35,031 --> 00:46:38,410
highly recommend it. It might have
the same effect on you. When you think

724
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:39,890
hardcore,

725
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:43,910
hardcore, hardcore histories,
the podcast and there's a series,

726
00:46:43,911 --> 00:46:48,050
there are four or five parts called the
wrath of the cons and it's about as it

727
00:46:48,051 --> 00:46:50,630
turns out,
Genghis Khan as opposed to gang iskcon.

728
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:53,420
It's incredible and the delivery

729
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:56,790
read a book
thoroughly enjoyed

730
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,130
a covers.

731
00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:06,130
It covers a number of different cons but
provides the pretext that the current,

732
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:09,410
I would say the then current
context and the delivery.

733
00:47:09,411 --> 00:47:11,480
It's a synthesis from
many different sources,

734
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:16,780
but give the first episode Alyson and
I think that you will very quickly then

735
00:47:17,151 --> 00:47:21,290
devour the entire series.
It's, it's amazing.

736
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:25,250
When you think of the word successful,
who's the first person who comes to mind?

737
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:26,873
Oh,

738
00:47:29,570 --> 00:47:31,620
and the way I view success is actually in,

739
00:47:31,621 --> 00:47:36,621
in terms of people's happiness and so
there are people let others normally know

740
00:47:37,481 --> 00:47:41,950
about that's the real success and
they were friends and so forth.

741
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:46,690
I think while they've achieved
this equanimity in life
and I just valued it that

742
00:47:46,691 --> 00:47:48,000
a lot when they were sheep people,

743
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:49,400
do you meditate?

744
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:56,320
I do. I meditate between a half hour, an
hour a day and have for several years,

745
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:02,360
single session in the morning,

746
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:07,290
in the morning
or anything else.

747
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:12,920
I actually got started because of
visiting this involvement and center,

748
00:48:12,921 --> 00:48:17,040
which is batten,
but in fact because I lived in Marina,

749
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:20,450
I live in San Francisco, we're
close to spirit rock, right?

750
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:21,460
Oh wonderful.

751
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:25,150
Become quite engaged with the community.
How to spirit rock,

752
00:48:25,151 --> 00:48:27,100
which is of that particular style.

753
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:32,990
Fantastic.
What would it be?

754
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:34,110
Well,

755
00:48:34,110 --> 00:48:38,930
I did your heart to ask because I view
myself as is constantly needing to

756
00:48:38,931 --> 00:48:39,430
change.

757
00:48:39,430 --> 00:48:40,263
Sure.

758
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:45,400
Others and looking at saying, okay,
well how can I do a better job?

759
00:48:45,401 --> 00:48:47,020
So it's not like just one thing.
It's like,

760
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:51,160
oh well there are a whole bunch of
things where I would like to evolve or

761
00:48:51,161 --> 00:48:54,940
improve and alter the view and,
and look at the world in different ways.

762
00:48:54,941 --> 00:48:56,950
So for me it's not so much changing.

763
00:48:56,951 --> 00:49:01,951
Something is can I take on a different
perspective so I understand or view

764
00:49:01,961 --> 00:49:03,130
things I didn't see before.

765
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:12,850
A few pieces of advice to your 20 year
old self. What would that advice be?

766
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:19,020
Well,
it's a tough one because to some extent,

767
00:49:19,050 --> 00:49:24,050
if I had told my 20 year old stuff a
lot of things that I know now just about

768
00:49:24,961 --> 00:49:28,530
life, I don't know if I
would have understood it.

769
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:32,370
So I come to the position where,
because I think,

770
00:49:32,371 --> 00:49:35,940
I mean the reason I wrote the book was
to try to explain things to people,

771
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:37,013
right?

772
00:49:39,170 --> 00:49:40,160
20 years old.

773
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:45,110
But the way I view this or any other
book is that you read things or you learn

774
00:49:45,111 --> 00:49:49,610
about them because you want to figure
out how to address issues and problems in

775
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:53,150
life.
But the danger is always that,

776
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:54,920
whether it's me or somebody else,

777
00:49:54,921 --> 00:49:59,921
if we can look at these things as a way
of somehow sidestepping the problems and

778
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:04,280
there's a subtle distinction there and
not everybody knows what they're doing.

779
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:10,010
But I think advice is actually one of
like you always face towards the problem.

780
00:50:10,070 --> 00:50:12,290
You actually can't avoid
the mess in the middle,

781
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:17,630
what you want or mechanisms to deal
with the mess. And in, in doing that,

782
00:50:17,631 --> 00:50:20,870
you will end up in a better place and
you'll get experiences that you can't get

783
00:50:20,871 --> 00:50:23,030
any other way than by experiencing them.

784
00:50:23,830 --> 00:50:24,090
What,

785
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:27,950
what do you think the advice whether he
would have taken or not year old self

786
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:30,620
most would have needed
to here would have been?

787
00:50:31,410 --> 00:50:35,910
Well, the reason it's hard is so much
enjoying my life and the people around it.

788
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:41,550
And I'm aware that if you make a change
and then the little minuscule changes

789
00:50:41,551 --> 00:50:46,120
can actually send you down radically
different paths. And so I'll say,

790
00:50:46,121 --> 00:50:49,770
well, okay, even if I've
made mistakes at the time,

791
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:50,773
right?

792
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:53,190
What I want to give myself advice,

793
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:56,610
which would have had me avoid that mistake
because then steak was part of who am

794
00:50:56,611 --> 00:50:58,230
I am that made me where I am?

795
00:50:58,490 --> 00:50:59,323
Right?

796
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:02,810
So I can look back and say, well, if
some of those things were painful,

797
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:07,070
I wish I hadn't done them
or done that or said that.

798
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:09,370
But it's not like I could say,
well,

799
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:13,070
avoid doing that because to some extent
going through the pain of making that

800
00:51:13,071 --> 00:51:14,740
mistake helped ultimately.

801
00:51:15,090 --> 00:51:15,923
Right.

802
00:51:16,450 --> 00:51:18,700
Hard to go back and see, okay,
do something differently.

803
00:51:21,810 --> 00:51:25,100
Unpredictable butterflies act
and what it could do to the rest.

804
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:28,840
Well this has been a lot of fun.
I really appreciate you making the time.

805
00:51:29,230 --> 00:51:34,230
Where should people learn more about you
or what would you encourage them to go

806
00:51:35,111 --> 00:51:37,510
check out? Of course I will
also put in the show notes,

807
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:41,710
links to the book and other resources.
But any, any parting thoughts?

808
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:46,850
I mean we've really touched on the
topics of course and when we've been 15

809
00:51:46,851 --> 00:51:49,070
minutes on this for me,

810
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,940
all the issues of what it means to
engage with others and dealing with

811
00:51:52,941 --> 00:51:57,941
uncertainty and how you address fear
and how you make safe environments are

812
00:51:59,210 --> 00:52:03,040
critical ones and how you looked at
the world and perceive it. And, and uh,

813
00:52:03,410 --> 00:52:08,300
our moral and ethical position in that
environment are all really important.

814
00:52:08,301 --> 00:52:12,830
And I don't have any short way of saying
them, but to me they're important and,

815
00:52:12,890 --> 00:52:13,341
and the help,

816
00:52:13,341 --> 00:52:17,870
I get at least touched on a few of them
in the book and then talking about some

817
00:52:17,871 --> 00:52:20,300
of our experiences as
we grew as a company.

818
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:23,420
And I want to make it clear
that we haven't figured it out,

819
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:26,930
the challenges in front of us,
every bit as big as they've always been.

820
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:30,083
Oh,

821
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:36,220
I can't wait to see what you guys produce
next and given how many mutual friends

822
00:52:36,691 --> 00:52:39,810
we have, hopefully we'll at some point
bump into each other in the bay area,

823
00:52:39,870 --> 00:52:43,440
but for now at least I will let you get
back to your day and thank you very much

824
00:52:43,441 --> 00:52:47,810
for taking the time. Thank
you very much, Tim. Thanks.

825
00:52:48,270 --> 00:52:49,103
