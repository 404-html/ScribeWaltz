1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:01,600
What are, what are the top, say,

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:07,110
two or three books that you
either discovered or delved
into while researching?

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,550
I was told us away. I mean, if you had to
pick your top two to three, you're like,

4
00:00:12,551 --> 00:00:15,950
all right, if you want to maximally
gain in whatever way, I'll let,

5
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:20,140
I'll leave it open to, to you read
these two or three bucks. Like,

6
00:00:20,141 --> 00:00:23,750
if these are the only two or three
books you read this year, you'll be,

7
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:24,730
you'll be better off

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,200
for having, okay. Well,

9
00:00:26,201 --> 00:00:30,160
I'm looking at the bibliography right
now and some that jumped out at me that

10
00:00:30,161 --> 00:00:31,330
were total favorites.

11
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:36,410
Ron Chernow's biography of John
D Rockefeller, which is Titan,

12
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:40,210
though the life of John d Rockefeller
was like a total game changer to me.

13
00:00:40,211 --> 00:00:44,770
It was an amazing biography. Um,
I like Sarah Bakewell, his book,

14
00:00:44,771 --> 00:00:45,604
how to live.

15
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:50,760
It's like a series of essays about
Montana who invented the essay. Yeah.

16
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,920
Um, he's really
fascinating. Sarah Bakewell.

17
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:55,840
Hmm,

18
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,760
cool. Um, I like, uh, let's
see. Oh, I read this book.

19
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:04,060
Um, the, uh, the fish that ate the whale,

20
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:09,190
the life and times of America's
banana king. He was this, uh,

21
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:15,010
a totally fascinating but relatively
unknown historical figure who started,

22
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:19,520
he started a fruit company
buying spoiling like the,

23
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,070
the day old, not daily, but
the, about to expire bananas.

24
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:28,300
Um, that would be important in
like late 18 hundreds, America.

25
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:32,980
And he would sell them, um, like
he would sell them by train car.

26
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,590
He ends up,
he ends up buying United fruit.

27
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:39,730
He starts a small fruit company that it
grows to be so big that it buys United

28
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:42,560
Fruit company, which is the biggest
fruit company in the world. Um,

29
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,590
so that's why he's known as
the fish that ate the whale.

30
00:01:44,591 --> 00:01:48,370
He's this sort of fascinating,
a Jewish businessman. Um,

31
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:53,340
I read a really good biography
of Edison by Matthew,

32
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:56,620
uh,
Josephson called Edison a biography.

33
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:57,950
Okay.

34
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:01,940
Got It. And if there was any
others, I'm trying to think.

35
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:04,690
Yeah, those were some, oh,

36
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:08,140
and I read a really good biography of
Ulysses s grant called Ulysses s grant,

37
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:11,170
triumph over adversity that I loved a lot.
