00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,450
Hello,
you sexy people out there.

2
00:00:01,451 --> 00:00:06,280
This is Tim Ferriss and this episode
of the Tim Ferriss podcast has a very

3
00:00:06,281 --> 00:00:08,560
special guest,
Josh Waitzkin,

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:13,630
whom I met in 2007 after reading his
spectacular book, the art of learning.

5
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,660
Josh, you may know from
searching for Bobby Fisher,

6
00:00:16,661 --> 00:00:20,950
he was the subject of both the book and
the movie he's thought of as a chess

7
00:00:20,951 --> 00:00:21,784
prodigy.

8
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:26,620
Although that term prodigy I don't believe
applies to him well at all because he

9
00:00:26,621 --> 00:00:30,610
has a method for learning,
mastering, refining any skill,

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,750
whether that is chess,

11
00:00:31,751 --> 00:00:36,250
whether that is Tai Chi in which he's
multiple time world champion Brazilian

12
00:00:36,251 --> 00:00:39,280
Jujitsu in which he's a
black belt under the phenom,

13
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,990
the Michael Jordan of the sport Marcella
Garcia and he's worked with people

14
00:00:43,991 --> 00:00:48,991
ranging from mark [inaudible] six time
Stanley Cup winner to cal Ripken Jr to

15
00:00:49,301 --> 00:00:51,040
the top hedge fund managers in the world.

16
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:56,220
He is a performance specialist and also
very dear friend of mine now at this

17
00:00:56,591 --> 00:00:59,350
point and I ended up loving his book,

18
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:03,730
the art of learning so much that I
acquired the rights to his audio book.

19
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:08,770
If you want to find that it's read by
Josh himself and a you can just go to for

20
00:01:08,771 --> 00:01:13,771
our blog for h o U R B l o g.com and
search for Tim Ferriss book club or go to

21
00:01:14,801 --> 00:01:16,990
Google and do the same.
So without further ado,

22
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:20,440
let's get straight to the meat of
the interview. I hope you enjoy it.

23
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:22,700
Optimal.
And then

24
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,630
my hands start shaking.

25
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:35,130
I'm a cybernetic organism living tissue.

26
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,360
So Josh,
I figured we might as well start

27
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:46,940
at the top and do a little retrospective.

28
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:51,080
What led you initially to
write the art of learning?

29
00:01:51,081 --> 00:01:55,160
And of course that's how I was in many
ways introduced to your work and then

30
00:01:55,161 --> 00:01:59,690
through our mutual friend Max ended
up connecting. But what was the,

31
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,000
what was the reason you
decided to write that book?

32
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,290
Um,

33
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:18,290
so I transitioned into meditating and
just studying East Asian philosophy and

34
00:02:18,501 --> 00:02:22,040
then I started getting into each
one and ultimately into the Marshall

35
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:22,731
application of it,

36
00:02:22,731 --> 00:02:27,731
pushed him and I started to experience
this very interesting transition from,

37
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,110
from the principals my level.

38
00:02:30,111 --> 00:02:33,470
And Chester's began to translate
directly over into the martial arts.

39
00:02:33,471 --> 00:02:35,960
And I think, I think it was
primarily one experience I had,

40
00:02:35,961 --> 00:02:38,960
but it was something around two
years into my tattoo training,

41
00:02:38,961 --> 00:02:41,480
I was giving a simultaneous
chest exhibition in Memphis,

42
00:02:41,481 --> 00:02:46,020
Tennessee at a fundraiser razor for
muscular dystrophy and I was playing 45 or

43
00:02:46,021 --> 00:02:46,970
50 boards at once.

44
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,990
I was at someone walking down the
middle of this big square of chess.

45
00:02:49,991 --> 00:02:51,320
Paypal's everyone's playing one game.

46
00:02:51,321 --> 00:02:55,850
I'm playing each of them and about
40 minutes into the Simon I had this

47
00:02:55,851 --> 00:02:57,440
experience that was so interesting.

48
00:02:57,441 --> 00:03:01,360
I began to feel like I was riding
the energetic wave of the game.

49
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,930
Like I was in my push hands training.
I wasn't playing chess,

50
00:03:04,931 --> 00:03:07,570
I wasn't thinking in chest language,
I wasn't calculating variations.

51
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,240
I was feeling the flow,
filling the space behind,

52
00:03:10,241 --> 00:03:13,870
like they wouldn't have martial arts.
And I had this realization, you know,

53
00:03:13,871 --> 00:03:16,780
I was playing beautiful chess,
but I wasn't consciously playing chess.

54
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:20,860
But the barriers between these two
different or to dissolve in my mind and

55
00:03:20,861 --> 00:03:25,861
that's when I started to conceive of
the idea of the book and a lot of the

56
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:29,580
process of I spent five
years taking notes, me four,

57
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:32,020
500 pages of notes in the book before
I actually sat down and wrote it.

58
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:35,800
And a lot of that process was
deconstructing what I'd been doing rather

59
00:03:35,801 --> 00:03:37,510
intuitively.
Um,

60
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:41,470
so essentially what it felt like before
his translation of parallel learning.

61
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,590
These are two rather abstract terms of
that's the language that I was using

62
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:46,900
internally when I was first thinking
about the book because it felt like I was

63
00:03:46,901 --> 00:03:49,990
just taking the essence of one art
and translate it over into another.

64
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:54,720
And in the process of writing it involved,
deconstructing what I'd been doing, um,

65
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:57,460
somewhat abstractly and is something that
can be replicated more systematically.

66
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:07,920
Simon,
you 10,

67
00:04:07,921 --> 00:04:10,560
20, 30, 40 boards simultaneously.

68
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,150
I'll try to ask a better question then.
How does someone do that?

69
00:04:15,151 --> 00:04:16,500
But at what point,

70
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:22,100
what happens to a chess player when they
go from an inability to play multiple

71
00:04:22,681 --> 00:04:26,490
boards simultaneously to being able to
play multiple boards simultaneously?

72
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,430
What is the sort of
framework or thinking or, or,

73
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,120
or experience and so in bolts up that
allows them to do something like that,

74
00:04:33,121 --> 00:04:37,230
which to the average person
seems like a rain man, like feet

75
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,950
know. I think it's different
for every chess player. I mean,

76
00:04:40,951 --> 00:04:43,350
one of the beautiful things about chess
is that you can approach it so many

77
00:04:43,351 --> 00:04:45,090
different ways and to be world class,

78
00:04:45,091 --> 00:04:49,140
what you need to do essentially
is expressed the core of
your being through the

79
00:04:49,141 --> 00:04:49,974
art.
I think that's just,

80
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,740
this is true of many arts
and that's probably something
that we'll get into more

81
00:04:52,741 --> 00:04:56,530
deeply. Um, so you can have a very
mathematical person who plays chess.

82
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:00,600
Mathematically, you can have a very
musical person who plays chess music.

83
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:05,760
Someone might be much more kinesthetic
like myself and sort of a feeling for

84
00:05:05,761 --> 00:05:07,300
flow and hidden harmonies and,

85
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,520
and almost a physically energetic
relationship to chest. Um,

86
00:05:11,521 --> 00:05:14,970
when I first learned to play chess when
I was six years old in Washington square

87
00:05:14,971 --> 00:05:18,570
park, it was, it was a battle.
I love the feeling of, of the,

88
00:05:18,571 --> 00:05:23,070
of just going to into a fight with
someone and finding these hidden harmonies

89
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:26,580
and finding where these animal pet
passions and mixed with this technical

90
00:05:26,581 --> 00:05:27,150
complexity.

91
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:32,150
And when I get late much later when
I got much better playing Simos um,

92
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:36,960
it was sort of a higher
level manifestation of
that same kind of dynamic.

93
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:41,990
I mean for me playing Simos was something
akin to juggling a lot of balls and,

94
00:05:42,931 --> 00:05:47,820
and all of the, to each chest. I wasn't
playing 40 different games for example,

95
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:48,870
separately,

96
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:53,870
the flow of all 40 games would sort of
coalesce into one larger sense of flow.

97
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,460
And it was actually really
interesting whenever,

98
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,380
as often when I give a Simon and there'd
be a youth competition and the winners

99
00:06:00,381 --> 00:06:01,820
of the youth competition
would play against me.

100
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,970
And so sometimes kids would would cheats,

101
00:06:04,971 --> 00:06:06,520
they'd really want to be and
these two they would sheets. I've,

102
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:07,970
you're walking around this big thing.

103
00:06:07,971 --> 00:06:10,630
And then I get to the table and it
shifted the position to try to win because

104
00:06:10,631 --> 00:06:11,690
they're getting when it
would be a big thing.

105
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:16,430
And my experience when that
happened was as if you had,

106
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,760
imagine you would like 40 balls up in
the air and suddenly then it all crashed

107
00:06:19,761 --> 00:06:23,660
into the floor. And I would know
that they had changed the position,

108
00:06:23,661 --> 00:06:27,110
not by reaching the board and remembering
what the position was and then seeing

109
00:06:27,111 --> 00:06:27,830
they changed it.

110
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,830
It would initially be this feeling of
the energetic flow has been interrupted.

111
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:36,230
Um, and then I'd have to reverse engineer
myself back to that one, what one game,

112
00:06:36,231 --> 00:06:37,460
that one component of the flow.

113
00:06:37,461 --> 00:06:40,400
And then I remember the game and then I
would remember exactly division had been,

114
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:43,490
and then I'd say that
this was the position. Um,

115
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,920
and then would take me two or three
times going back around and they get that

116
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,980
all the balls back up in the air and
they get back to the energetic flow.

117
00:06:48,981 --> 00:06:50,480
So actually for me,

118
00:06:50,481 --> 00:06:55,460
giving Simos sort of felt similar
to playing chess one Cheskin. Um,

119
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:56,690
but that was my own relationship to it.

120
00:06:56,691 --> 00:06:58,790
I think that probably if
you're adding 10 different,

121
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:01,340
very strong chess players that all
give somewhat different answers.

122
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:08,790
Spending time with a friend of yours

123
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:15,290
when we went to Washington square park
and seeing him play game at least for the

124
00:07:15,931 --> 00:07:17,760
first portion without
looking at the board.

125
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,880
And I'm not gonna I won't
give away too much of the two.

126
00:07:20,881 --> 00:07:25,760
Most of the punch lines since we,
uh, we captured it all on a film.

127
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:29,040
It was pretty amazing.
But just his ability to track the board,

128
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:30,811
uh,

129
00:07:30,811 --> 00:07:35,670
it seemed like by chunking portions
of the board into sort of larger,

130
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:40,080
um, like distal pieces. I, I don't know
if that's the best way to express it,

131
00:07:40,081 --> 00:07:45,081
but it seemed like his
ability to seemingly remember
all these disparate pieces

132
00:07:45,211 --> 00:07:48,160
was because he had it broken,
the,

133
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:52,890
the board broken down into sort
of a component chunks as it were.

134
00:07:52,891 --> 00:07:57,500
But, uh, I don't want to take us
to down that, that fine line. Um,

135
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,160
let's, let's shift gears. I want to,
what I'd be very curious to know is, um,

136
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:04,050
you know, at this point what, what,

137
00:08:04,051 --> 00:08:06,810
because I know of course a little
bit of the background, but, uh,

138
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:08,640
I want to dig into the details.

139
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,720
What type of people do you personally
work with these days and why do they work

140
00:08:15,301 --> 00:08:17,100
with you?
What type of things do you do with them?

141
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:19,523
Yeah,

142
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:26,370
three major dimensions
to my creative life.

143
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,940
I guess the most important
one is my son Jack,

144
00:08:29,941 --> 00:08:33,390
who I use it a little over two
years old and loving my life.

145
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:37,650
So that's maybe the most important part
of my life. No question about it. Um,

146
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:40,140
I run a nonprofit educational
foundation and we have, um,

147
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:42,830
a couple of JW foundation and
the art of learning projects. Um,

148
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,800
and we have a couple of hundred programs
in schools around the country and

149
00:08:46,801 --> 00:08:47,640
internationally as well.

150
00:08:47,641 --> 00:08:50,610
And so this is integrating
these principles that have
been developing in, in,

151
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:52,320
in schools,
working with teachers,

152
00:08:52,321 --> 00:08:56,280
parents and children around
this individualized and
automatic relationship to

153
00:08:56,281 --> 00:08:58,050
learning and development.
So this is one dimension.

154
00:08:58,051 --> 00:09:00,140
The other one is I own
a martial arts school.

155
00:09:00,141 --> 00:09:03,330
Of Brazilian Jujitsu to school with um,
Marcello Garcia,

156
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:05,800
who's the nine time world
champion. You know, I'm well Tim,

157
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:09,580
he's just make really the Michael
Jordan of the grappling world. Um,

158
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,440
so there's this world class athletes
training there and then I run a consulting

159
00:09:13,441 --> 00:09:16,380
business where I'm training people who
are at the cutting edge of the finance

160
00:09:16,381 --> 00:09:16,800
world.

161
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,550
And this is really interesting work
cause we're focusing on that last one or

162
00:09:20,551 --> 00:09:23,310
0.1% of the learning process,
which is really my specialty.

163
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:25,590
It's highly individualized,

164
00:09:25,591 --> 00:09:28,230
this cutting edge work on their learning
process that their idea generation,

165
00:09:28,231 --> 00:09:32,580
their creativity, that performance
psychology, their resilience. Um,

166
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:37,760
fascinating work. And you know what I
discovered, it's interesting because I,

167
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:41,850
I wrote this book called
the art of learning years
ago and so people are always

168
00:09:41,851 --> 00:09:43,200
coming to me to speak about learning,

169
00:09:43,201 --> 00:09:47,580
but much of what I've been focused on
in recent years has been learning when I

170
00:09:47,581 --> 00:09:50,700
think, when I think about that
last, that last movement, you know,

171
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:53,250
from the equivalent of being say
number 10 to number one in the world.

172
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,870
And number five being
number one in the world.

173
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:59,730
It's much more about finding subtle
obstructions, finding friction points,

174
00:09:59,731 --> 00:10:04,220
releasing, um, identify and cognitive
biases and make blocking your way.

175
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:07,160
It's sort of, it's the movement
towards unobstructed self expressions.

176
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:10,550
Every think about about your
creative process as a hose with a,

177
00:10:10,551 --> 00:10:11,730
with a big crimp in it.

178
00:10:11,731 --> 00:10:15,210
If you're released it just unbelievable
pressure can be released. Um,

179
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:19,350
and a lot of what I'm doing with
people is trying to move them from,

180
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,820
from very good to great or
from great to truly elite, um,

181
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:29,220
just deeply individualized
work and helping them really
find ways to express the

182
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:33,030
core of their being through
their art, which is, as you know,

183
00:10:33,031 --> 00:10:36,000
a big theme in my life from when I
played chess at my highest level.

184
00:10:36,001 --> 00:10:39,220
That's what I was doing when I had a
period of being really locked up in my

185
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:41,850
check his career, which we can go
into in more detail if you want.

186
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,640
I was doing the opposite. I was trying
to fit into someone else's mold.

187
00:10:44,641 --> 00:10:47,220
And then ultimately when I transitioned
away from Chason to the martial arts,

188
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,400
I returned to that experience of,
of self expression.

189
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,010
And that's what I really start
to understand it very deeply.

190
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:55,740
I think it was the crisis towards
the end of my chess career,

191
00:10:55,741 --> 00:11:00,390
which really literally the foundation
for the work that I used today with,

192
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:04,020
with brilliant mental performance who
are just trying to make that movement to

193
00:11:04,021 --> 00:11:05,520
the equivalent to a world champion.

194
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,350
Yeah.

195
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:17,390
And you've, you've gone to war
with him and I've watched you,

196
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:22,250
I've gone to war with him,
which I, if there's anything
at stake, I don't recommend

197
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,530
you guys got to be a lot of pain.

198
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:30,970
He's a tough guy,
but also a sweetheart of a guy and

199
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:38,120
he's so fluid. Uh, what I'd love to hear
from you, of course, because in the,

200
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:41,330
the, in the art of learning, which,

201
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:45,330
which some people might be familiar
with the read about your experiences and

202
00:11:45,331 --> 00:11:47,830
chest,
your experiences in Tai-chi,

203
00:11:47,831 --> 00:11:52,831
the parallels between them and this
sort of over arching a framework for

204
00:11:54,551 --> 00:11:59,080
optimizing mental and physical
performance, if that's a
fair way to put it. Uh,

205
00:11:59,081 --> 00:12:00,330
which is, you know, the, the,

206
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:03,590
the art of learning these different
techniques and strategies. What,

207
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,600
what have you learned through this
third art or Brazilian Jujitsu?

208
00:12:08,891 --> 00:12:09,221
What are,

209
00:12:09,221 --> 00:12:14,221
what are some insights or strategies that
you've had since moving from Tai Chi,

210
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:21,190
which is in some ways similar but also
very different from Brazilian Jujitsu,

211
00:12:21,191 --> 00:12:24,790
which a lot of people would be familiar
with through the UFC and mixed martial

212
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:25,624
arts

213
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:33,200
learning ends with the 2004 world
championship. It ends with it.

214
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,400
It was just absolutely
hiring crazy experience. Um,

215
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:42,210
I won't give the punchline but,
but it was, it was really intense.

216
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:46,260
And after this I just started,
I decided I wanted to be a beginner,

217
00:12:46,261 --> 00:12:49,530
getting to put on a white belt,
um, literally and figuratively.

218
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:53,790
And so I took on this third major mountain
in my life, preserving, you should sue.

219
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,840
I was training out in the west coast
for about a year when I was actually

220
00:12:57,841 --> 00:12:59,910
writing the art of learning.
I was training Brazilian Jiu Jitsu twice,

221
00:12:59,911 --> 00:13:03,750
a twice a day. Um, this was after
I'd spent five years taking notes.

222
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:06,450
Then I had the 2004 worlds
when I was writing it. Um,

223
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:09,810
I started training with John Machado
out there. Then I came back to New York.

224
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:11,670
I started training with
Marco Austin does here,

225
00:13:11,671 --> 00:13:13,980
and I started to develop this
relationship with Marcello,

226
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:17,370
who's just the greatest
grappler to ever live.

227
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:21,060
And we were doing a lot of
private lessons. Um, I was,
we developed a friendship,

228
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:24,240
then he moved to Florida and I would
travel to Florida to work with him.

229
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,340
And ultimately I made the decision,

230
00:13:26,341 --> 00:13:28,860
I wanted to bring him to
New York mostly because I,

231
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,160
I was at that point planning to make a
run for the world championship and this

232
00:13:32,161 --> 00:13:36,270
art and there was no better way to do
it then to get my ass kicked by the very

233
00:13:36,271 --> 00:13:39,540
best to ever live in the sport.
And he's just a wonderful guy. Um,

234
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,450
and he's just unbelievable
martial artists.

235
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,960
And so we opened up the school together
and [inaudible] I've been on the mass

236
00:13:45,961 --> 00:13:47,180
with him,
you know,

237
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:51,030
other than when one of us has been
injured and it's been a lot of injuries in

238
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:52,740
these sports just all the time.

239
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:57,060
And it's been a fascinating experience
and more solar was so profoundly

240
00:13:57,061 --> 00:14:01,410
different from me. I'm a really
conceptual guidance. I think abstractly,

241
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:04,200
of course my foundation and chest
Marcello is one of the most,

242
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:07,440
well he's the most kinesthetically
overdeveloped person they've ever met.

243
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:11,160
And of course over development under
development tend to come hand in hand

244
00:14:11,161 --> 00:14:12,840
conceptually.
Um,

245
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:17,280
an example of that would be an example

246
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,010
of overdevelopment own development,

247
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:23,510
uh, of kinesthetic. What it
means to be kinesthetically

248
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,270
his physical intelligence
is mind boggling.

249
00:14:26,271 --> 00:14:27,950
And then when he'd come fishing with me,
you know,

250
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:32,090
you throw him on a standup paddleboard
in three foot shop and everyone just

251
00:14:32,091 --> 00:14:35,180
flies off of paddle boards and they
should just stand up on them and he's just

252
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:38,800
beautiful. I'm just, you just find the
balance points I've never seen one soon.

253
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:43,310
Someone learn so quickly how to handle um,
waves,

254
00:14:43,311 --> 00:14:47,750
boats, handling, fishing lines
being, you know, free diving,

255
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:51,260
being on riding waves on paddle
boards. You know, when you,

256
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:54,320
when you're in the marsh. I've been
a stand up fighter for many years.

257
00:14:54,321 --> 00:14:58,700
I mean throwing as my core, my core when
I'm doing standup training with Marcel,

258
00:14:58,701 --> 00:15:03,350
I caught him with most of the
throws of my repertoire one time.

259
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:06,420
I don't think I've ever caught
him with a throw twice. Wow.

260
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,080
As you were world class while
I was training with, you know,

261
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:14,520
I catch them thousands of times.
This is a guy, he, he just,

262
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:18,540
you almost never see Marcello get
caught more than once with something.

263
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,063
Um,

264
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:24,450
and it's amazing to see how he relates
to the world through is kinesthetic

265
00:15:24,451 --> 00:15:25,920
intelligence. So for
example, if you're looking,

266
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:27,840
when we were looking for
spaces for our school,

267
00:15:27,841 --> 00:15:31,500
we'd walk into a big room and I be
thinking about the dimensions, you know,

268
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,420
the square footage where this would be,

269
00:15:33,421 --> 00:15:36,120
where that would be more so it would
know if it felt good or felt bad.

270
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:37,291
If he meets you,

271
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:40,740
he's going to know whether he feels good
about you or he feels bad about you and

272
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:42,960
his intuition is incredibly dead on.

273
00:15:42,961 --> 00:15:45,540
But he navigates the world through
this Kenneth Static intelligence.

274
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:49,320
And it's been a really fascinating having
the school with him and diving deep

275
00:15:49,321 --> 00:15:50,380
with them.
Um,

276
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:53,790
because we've been having
conceptual dialogue these
three and a half years or so,

277
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:56,250
and he's really deepened,
um, conceptually,

278
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:02,400
but I've learned even more deeply in the
importance of the lesson that there are

279
00:16:02,401 --> 00:16:03,750
many paths to greatness.

280
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:07,950
And to take a guy like Marcello and to
try to fit them into a chess players,

281
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:08,670
you know,

282
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:13,530
hyper conceptual molds would be terrible
because you'd be killing is shine.

283
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:19,140
And he is so great because of his just
unbelievable commitment to doing it his

284
00:16:19,141 --> 00:16:22,500
way. And he's done things in
extraordinary ways. I mean, for example,

285
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,000
you know how in these competitive arts,

286
00:16:24,001 --> 00:16:26,740
everyone's very secret about
the repertoires. Yep. Um,

287
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:29,820
well we have this program which you know
well called Mgu inaction where people,

288
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:34,680
just two guys from around the world log
in to watch all of our sorrows training

289
00:16:34,681 --> 00:16:37,110
sessions, his sparring
sessions, his lessons,

290
00:16:37,111 --> 00:16:39,570
everything when he was competing
it not with Dobie submission,

291
00:16:39,571 --> 00:16:41,250
grappling world championship.
And when jobs,

292
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:43,920
which is the Brazilian Jujitsu
world championship, we were spoiled.

293
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:47,310
We were streaming is sparring
sessions every night.

294
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:51,250
So he was basically showing
these competitors what he
was about to two weeks.

295
00:16:51,251 --> 00:16:53,810
In three weeks, four weeks.
And his attitude about this,

296
00:16:53,811 --> 00:16:57,950
which is completely unique,
if you're studying my game,

297
00:16:57,951 --> 00:17:00,190
you're entering my game and
I'll be better at it, you know?

298
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:05,160
Yeah.

299
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,300
I'm the opposite of what most chess
players would do and most of your district

300
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:12,980
guys would do. And so he's wide open
to constant learning and they look at,

301
00:17:12,981 --> 00:17:15,310
the beautiful thing about Marcello is,
you know,

302
00:17:15,311 --> 00:17:18,390
if people call him the king of scrambles
and if you watch his training style,

303
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,590
he's always in transition,

304
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,740
which is a really interesting idea to
think about in a cross disciplinary manner

305
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:26,340
because most people get
their egos involved in their
training and they're trying

306
00:17:26,341 --> 00:17:28,050
to dominate all the time and to dominate.

307
00:17:28,051 --> 00:17:30,900
And almost anything you find a
position of dominance and you keep it.

308
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,870
But Marcello always led
to the opponent's move.

309
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,940
And so he's constantly
playing in transition.

310
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,470
And so if you think about what worldclass
martial arts means, and you brought up,

311
00:17:40,471 --> 00:17:43,890
for example, Merissa Ashley and it
playing chess and Washington square,

312
00:17:43,891 --> 00:17:46,440
it's similar. If you're at a
much higher level than someone,

313
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:50,070
you can always seem mystical because
you're things which are outside of their

314
00:17:50,071 --> 00:17:50,880
conceptual scheme.

315
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,270
The way that operates in the martial
arts is if you think about it through the

316
00:17:54,271 --> 00:17:55,620
lens of frames,
right?

317
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:00,000
If you and I are looking at a position
and in your mind there's this position,

318
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,200
this position, this position. Um, so
there's three positions in my mind.

319
00:18:04,201 --> 00:18:07,490
If I'm constantly training at the
transitions between these petitions,

320
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:12,500
these actually expand in
these transitional frames
become positions to me.

321
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:16,920
And so if I'm seeing a hundred
positions when you're seeing take two,

322
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:21,780
then I can play in your blind spots and
they could see mystical to you because

323
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:24,930
you haven't trained there.
And that's what Marcella does,

324
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,730
like spending all of
his time in transition.

325
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:30,030
He's cultivated the art to play in the,
in between,

326
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,280
which is really what level is all about.
Um,

327
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:36,510
or one of the core things that highlight
the worldclass martial arts is all

328
00:18:36,511 --> 00:18:41,250
about playing in transition and
gaps in your opponents. Syep pattern

329
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,000
just blew me away because if you look
at it as an uninformed spectator or even

330
00:18:55,011 --> 00:18:58,490
just a moderately informed spectator,
you're blown away by how fast he is,

331
00:18:58,491 --> 00:19:00,250
how effectively he is.
But the,

332
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:05,860
the nuance of sort of eliciting movement,

333
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:09,200
allowing space to open
manufacturing space by let's say,

334
00:19:09,201 --> 00:19:14,201
applying pressure and then leaving it is
so subtle and so incredibly effective.

335
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:18,260
I mean,
then you start to notice it from these,

336
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:22,650
these principles of carry over to
many, many hundreds of possible, uh,

337
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,710
positions. Let's just say. Um, it's
really, yeah, it's really amazing. I mean,

338
00:19:27,711 --> 00:19:32,500
it reminds me of something I heard
once from a musician, which was, uh,

339
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:35,090
I don't know who the original quote
is from, but he said that, you know,

340
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:39,170
music is the space between the
notes. And I was like, Huh,

341
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:42,030
that's a really interesting way
to look at it. Uh, but, but,

342
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:42,883
but what were you gonna say?

343
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,260
I think that's just a gorgeous quote and
I think that that are defined by that,

344
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,340
that space in between.

345
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:53,710
Yeah. Well, it's like writing, writing
is the same way, right? It's like,

346
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:58,720
when in doubt, leave it out. It's
just like, you know, it's uh, I think,

347
00:19:58,721 --> 00:19:59,730
uh,
yeah.

348
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,850
Beautiful, beautiful plan.
Yeah, of course. It's,

349
00:20:01,851 --> 00:20:06,851
think about Marcello is that it can
often seem initially that he's moving so

350
00:20:07,381 --> 00:20:08,000
fast,

351
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,480
but what's incredible is that he can also
move very slow and do things that you

352
00:20:12,481 --> 00:20:13,314
don't see.

353
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:16,350
I'm just like a great side of sleight
of hand artist who's just practicing the

354
00:20:16,351 --> 00:20:17,860
art of illusion when
we're not practicing it.

355
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,700
It's amazing what can
be done with intention,

356
00:20:20,701 --> 00:20:23,160
with controlling someone's intention.
Um,

357
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:27,930
and this is a lot of my training and
push hands related to finding ways to,

358
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:33,770
to essentially control someone's intention
so that you were ahead of them even

359
00:20:34,591 --> 00:20:37,840
if, if they were ultimately
moving first. Um,

360
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,270
you were there before they
arrived. This is fascinating. Um,

361
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:45,480
psychological component of really
high level training in anything.

362
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,940
Well, I, uh, I remember an
interview or it wasn't an interview,

363
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:51,300
a window wasn't interview actually with,
um,

364
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:55,110
one of the top k one fighters
back in the day. Yeah. Uh,

365
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,880
and they were talking about Peter air,
et cetera.

366
00:20:57,881 --> 00:21:02,470
If you remember the Dutch lumberjack,
huge guy and he,

367
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:07,120
he seemed fast.
And I remember what people said.

368
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:11,080
A number of opponents said, you know,
he's, he's actually not that fast.

369
00:21:11,081 --> 00:21:12,700
He's kind of a big lumbering guy,

370
00:21:12,701 --> 00:21:17,701
but he's so good at predicting timing
that he sees you telegraph before you even

371
00:21:20,561 --> 00:21:24,940
have the thought to throw the Punch and
he beats you to the punch as a result of

372
00:21:24,941 --> 00:21:28,810
that. But it's because he's, he picks
up on the cues faster than other people.

373
00:21:28,811 --> 00:21:31,030
And I thought that was
very interesting to, uh,

374
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:35,770
to try to bridge this to something else.
I mean, what you work with, of course,

375
00:21:35,771 --> 00:21:36,640
I'm not gonna mention names,

376
00:21:36,641 --> 00:21:41,641
but you work with some of the
most stunningly successful
and famous traders and

377
00:21:43,931 --> 00:21:47,920
people in finance. I mean some real kind
of masters of the universe type folks.

378
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,570
What,
what have you,

379
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:54,310
what have you found unique
about that group of people?

380
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,150
Uh, let's, let's, let's
just start with that. Um,

381
00:21:57,151 --> 00:21:59,140
I'm curious to know kind of what you've,

382
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,150
what you've noticed being as observant
as you are about that group of folks.

383
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:07,490
Oh,
that's a big question.

384
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,680
It is a big question.

385
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,083
I mean,

386
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:20,870
each one of these guys who's really
world class is doing it his way and he's

387
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,910
harnessing that

388
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:28,050
he's cultivating or his or her
strengths as a way of life. Um,

389
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:31,950
there's not an excessive focus on
weakness. There's just an embracing of

390
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:33,901
deep,

391
00:22:33,901 --> 00:22:37,980
deep study of the preconditions to
someone's finest moments of expression and

392
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:39,010
building lifestyle surrounded.

393
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:42,840
And that's a lot of what I do is help
people understand what makes them tick on

394
00:22:42,841 --> 00:22:47,100
a very, very deep level
relative to, um, you know,

395
00:22:47,101 --> 00:22:51,600
the cognitive biases where they locked
up and were there reasons has become, um,

396
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:54,000
what kind of external conditions,
what kind of internal conditions.

397
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,810
And the ones who were really
at the top are people who,

398
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:03,920
who have mastered this art
of deep introspection and
taking the result of these

399
00:23:04,291 --> 00:23:09,090
interspective processes and turn them
into training systems and into a way of

400
00:23:09,091 --> 00:23:12,300
life. Um, and it's fascinating how, how,

401
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:17,070
how the process works. And what
I do with these guys is I, I, um,

402
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,110
if after I do my initial
diagnostic process,

403
00:23:19,111 --> 00:23:21,240
I have ways of revamping
of the daily architecture,

404
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:24,480
the way they live their life
so that they're, for example,

405
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:28,710
aligning their peak energy periods
where there be creativity work.

406
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:33,510
They're building lifestyles that
are just relentlessly proactive,

407
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:38,490
um, as opposed to reacting to inputs.
They're building a daily architecture,

408
00:23:38,491 --> 00:23:41,130
which is based on maximizing
the creative process.

409
00:23:41,131 --> 00:23:43,550
And if you think about this
relative to most people, um,

410
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:46,640
simple case in point is email checking,
right?

411
00:23:46,641 --> 00:23:50,750
And most people when they finish a break,
even, even top guys and industries,

412
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:53,210
when they finish a break, whether they
wake up first thing in the morning,

413
00:23:53,211 --> 00:23:53,930
what do most people do?

414
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:56,600
They check their email when
they come back from a workout,

415
00:23:56,601 --> 00:24:00,700
whether they check their email,
when they come back from lunch ways,

416
00:24:00,701 --> 00:24:02,420
do they check their email?
And so what you see is this,

417
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:07,230
whenever they're coming back from
something after a break there soaking in

418
00:24:07,231 --> 00:24:10,430
inputs. And so they live this
reactive lifestyle there.

419
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:14,780
Their creative process is dominated by
external noise as opposed to internal

420
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,400
music.
Um,

421
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:21,520
and a lot of what I work on with guys
is creating rhythms and their life that

422
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,240
really are based on feeding the
unconscious mind, which is really,

423
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:30,490
which is the wellspring of
creativity information. Um,

424
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:32,120
and then tapping it.
So for example,

425
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:36,140
ending the workday with high quality focus
on a certain area of complexity where

426
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,990
you could use an insight and then waking
up first thing in the morning pre input

427
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,800
and applying your mind to
it. Journaling on it. Um,

428
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:47,360
not so much to do a big brainstorm
but to tap what you've been working on

429
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:48,290
unconsciously overnight,

430
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:52,340
which of course is a principle
the Hemingway wrote about
when he spoke about the

431
00:24:52,341 --> 00:24:57,040
two core principles in his
creative writing process
where one ending the workday

432
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,130
with something left to right.

433
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,213
Yup.

434
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:04,300
Right.
So not doing everything he had to do,

435
00:25:04,301 --> 00:25:06,580
which most people do because they feel
the sense of guilt if they're not working.

436
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:08,680
Um,
you and I have discussed this at length,

437
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,710
but leaving something left to right
and then waking up and then the second

438
00:25:11,711 --> 00:25:14,200
principle, release your mind from
it. Don't think about it all night.

439
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:17,840
Really let go. Have a glass of wine
and wake up first thing in the morning,

440
00:25:17,841 --> 00:25:18,970
then reapply your mind to it.

441
00:25:18,971 --> 00:25:22,540
And it's amazing because you're basically
feeding the mind complexity and then

442
00:25:22,541 --> 00:25:25,240
tapping that complexity our top
and what you've done with it.

443
00:25:25,241 --> 00:25:28,110
And I mean this rhythm,
you know, the, the,

444
00:25:28,111 --> 00:25:30,400
the large variation of it is overnight.

445
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:33,280
Then you can do micro bursts of it
throughout the day before workouts.

446
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:37,270
Pose a question and do a workout, release
your mind after workout, return to it,

447
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:40,570
and do a creative burst before you go
to the bathroom, before you go to lunch,

448
00:25:40,571 --> 00:25:41,404
before anything.

449
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:46,060
And there's a way of systematically
training yourself to generate the

450
00:25:46,061 --> 00:25:47,920
crystallization experienced ah ha moment.

451
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:49,960
That can happen once a
month or once a year.

452
00:25:49,961 --> 00:25:53,980
A lot of what I do is work on systems to
help it happen once a day or four times

453
00:25:53,981 --> 00:25:54,920
a day.
Um,

454
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,980
and when you're talking about guys who
run by answer groups of 20 to $30 billion,

455
00:25:59,981 --> 00:26:02,560
for example,
if they have a huge insight that can,

456
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,240
that can have unbelievable value.

457
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:08,800
And so if you can really train people
to get systematic about nurture in their

458
00:26:08,801 --> 00:26:11,170
creative process,
it's unbelievable what can happen.

459
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,860
And most of that work relates
to getting out of your own way.

460
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:19,120
At a very high level. It's,
it's unlearning, it's the
constant practice of sure.

461
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:22,080
Subtraction, reducing friction. Um,

462
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:28,460
you mentioned cognitive people who
may not be familiar with that term,

463
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:35,330
cognitive biases and how
someone might work on them,

464
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:40,640
right? Well, there are a lot
of cognitive biases that are,

465
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:45,210
that are specific to certain disciplines
like chess or finance or philosophy.

466
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:49,530
Um, but if we just think about
it in terms of everyday life, um,

467
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:54,560
let's say we make a decision and we then
feel the need to justify that decision.

468
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,800
And so we make more decisions to
justify that Mitchell decision.

469
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:01,590
And then we basically get
herself into this deep wormhole,

470
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:05,420
which is caused by the attempt to justify.

471
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:08,940
Exactly.

472
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:12,120
So this is in the financial group who
were one of the world's talking about sunk

473
00:27:12,121 --> 00:27:16,410
cost fallacy, right? Um, but this is
very interesting for, for example,

474
00:27:16,411 --> 00:27:21,411
a chess player who makes a
certain decision and there's
a certain emotional and

475
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:27,390
intellectual and time component to the
value we put into the thought process

476
00:27:27,391 --> 00:27:32,100
behind that decision. And what we often
have to do is release it because the, the,

477
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:35,670
the position changes shape.
A very interesting way that
this manifests in chest,

478
00:27:35,671 --> 00:27:37,380
which you can think
about rather universally,

479
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:41,340
is let's say that there is a certain
evaluation to the position, right?

480
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,021
You and I are playing,

481
00:27:43,021 --> 00:27:45,630
Tim and I have a slight advantage in
the position that I'm nurturing that

482
00:27:45,631 --> 00:27:47,970
advantage of nurturing
them nurturing and um,

483
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,740
and a lot of complexity and make a spider.

484
00:27:49,741 --> 00:27:51,570
And suddenly the addition is equalized,
right?

485
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:55,740
So if I'm holding on to the past
evaluation emotionally where I had the

486
00:27:55,741 --> 00:27:56,574
advantage,

487
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:59,850
then what I'm going to do very subtly
is I'm going to reject positions that

488
00:27:59,851 --> 00:28:01,290
don't give me that advantage.

489
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:06,470
But if that I no longer have an advantage
that I'm going to be reaching too far,

490
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,900
right? Um, and then I'm only
rejecting things they should accept,

491
00:28:09,901 --> 00:28:11,820
which will make my position to
slip more and more and more.

492
00:28:11,821 --> 00:28:13,500
And you fall into what I call it,
downward spiral.

493
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:15,450
So this relates to a lack of presence,

494
00:28:15,451 --> 00:28:19,230
which really connects to a cognitive bias
and addiction to a past evaluation as

495
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:22,750
opposed to a present one. Um, so
that's a very simple example of,

496
00:28:22,751 --> 00:28:25,410
of a cognitive bias.
Um, a mental addiction,

497
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:30,170
I thought constructs something that we
hold to be true because of some comp

498
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:34,770
complicated twist in our mind.
It's no longer actually true.

499
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:39,330
And so of course a very simple antidotes,
motion, most of us is presence.

500
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:43,710
If we can look at a moment or chest
position or an investment decision or any

501
00:28:43,711 --> 00:28:47,640
decision with very clean presence
outside of kind of emotional inertia,

502
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:49,050
um,

503
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:54,050
then we can often slice through just
amazing amounts of fat with just very,

504
00:28:54,991 --> 00:28:57,480
very simple decisions. If you think
about the learning process, for example,

505
00:28:57,481 --> 00:28:59,490
and this is one thing that I love
about your approach to learning,

506
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:05,070
I language that you and I
use is, you know, I call you
a master of deconstruction.

507
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:10,240
You look at the way people approach
different sports and you find the biases,

508
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,430
the false construct,

509
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,473
right?

510
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,240
And you find a way to learn

511
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:19,850
a very straight path to learning as
opposed to people getting mired and all

512
00:29:19,851 --> 00:29:22,870
sorts of tangled webs of complexity,
which, which are, you know,

513
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:25,880
essentially caused by cognitive biases,
wouldn't, isn't how you'd put it.

514
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:36,230
I think you and I have very complimentary
approaches and like you've said before,

515
00:29:36,231 --> 00:29:39,510
and I tend to focus on
the 80 20 analysis as it,

516
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:44,440
as it applies to people getting up and
off the ground as quickly as possible to

517
00:29:44,441 --> 00:29:48,550
say, you know, top whatever, five
to 10% in the general population.

518
00:29:48,551 --> 00:29:53,551
Whereas what's so cool about
our conversations would I
enjoy so much in part is

519
00:29:53,741 --> 00:29:57,790
that, you know, you're really focusing
on that, that, that final leap.

520
00:29:57,791 --> 00:30:01,750
How do you go from being great
to being the best? Right?
And they're, they're very,

521
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:07,240
they're, they're very complimentary
skill sets. I think that, uh,

522
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,480
yeah, but when I'm looking
at, and this is a, is a,

523
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,940
is a way to unearth cognitive biases.

524
00:30:12,941 --> 00:30:15,190
And just as a side note for
people who want to look into this,

525
00:30:15,191 --> 00:30:19,000
you can just go to Wikipedia and search
list of cognitive biases and there's,

526
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:23,350
there's a long list which is
pretty fun to read. Um, and, uh,

527
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:27,100
there are a number of books about these
types of things to think twice I think

528
00:30:27,101 --> 00:30:31,450
is another one. Um, the, the
question that I ask myself,

529
00:30:31,451 --> 00:30:35,710
and I'm always interested in the questions
that people ask themselves because I

530
00:30:35,711 --> 00:30:39,610
find it in to my mind that those,

531
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:43,660
that internal dialog is what defines your
day to day thinking and what you think

532
00:30:43,661 --> 00:30:47,950
you become. So it's so critical that
you ask yourself the right questions.

533
00:30:47,951 --> 00:30:52,180
And in my mind what, or I
should say, rather, when I'm
trying to deconstruct, say,

534
00:30:52,181 --> 00:30:56,920
a sport, all I'll ask it is
to start with, you know, what,

535
00:30:56,921 --> 00:31:01,690
what rules are people following
that are not required?

536
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:05,710
Right? So, you know, outside
of the law and science, uh,

537
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:10,210
and even within science and within law,
reality's gonna negotiable. So I mean,

538
00:31:10,211 --> 00:31:14,830
a good instance, a of that
is the high jump and, uh,

539
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:16,080
the Fosbury flop.

540
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:20,470
So Dick Fosbury and it was really the
first guy to go backwards over the high

541
00:31:20,471 --> 00:31:24,130
joke and up to that point there had
been straddled kicks and all sorts of

542
00:31:24,131 --> 00:31:28,120
different approaches and he was ridiculed
at first and then he was called a

543
00:31:28,121 --> 00:31:32,680
cheat because he won the gold medal. And
now everybody uses that approach. And uh,

544
00:31:32,681 --> 00:31:36,130
so you know, having, uh, a list of
questions, right, who's good at this,

545
00:31:36,131 --> 00:31:40,180
who shouldn't be is another one that
I love to ask because you might find

546
00:31:40,181 --> 00:31:41,140
someone,
for instance,

547
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:45,140
you were talking about the
different styles and in
chess or Jujitsu or in chess,

548
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,073
you know,

549
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:51,380
as sort of a reference to
your first book, uh, you know,

550
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:54,040
you have attacking chessplayers,
right? Then you have,

551
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:57,940
you have very different stylistic
differences and you've very quantitative

552
00:31:57,941 --> 00:32:02,620
players. Uh, and for the, for the, the
TV show for the Tim Ferriss experiment,

553
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:06,460
I did an episode on poker and I've avoided
poker my whole life because of viewed

554
00:32:06,461 --> 00:32:11,440
it as a game of chance. And I had a, a
former computer science guy who said, no,

555
00:32:11,441 --> 00:32:11,830
no,
no,

556
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:15,460
I'm not going to teach you to be lucky
because I can't teach you to be lucky. Uh,

557
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:20,640
but I can teach you to run
some probabilities and only
bet when you have a good

558
00:32:21,131 --> 00:32:24,130
likelihood of a positive,
a positive outcome. Right?

559
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:28,570
And what what was so fascinating is you
look at a guy like that and you'll find

560
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:31,420
a highly quantitative, say,
Hedge Fund managers for instance,

561
00:32:31,421 --> 00:32:34,920
or a or investors of different types,
tech investors who,

562
00:32:34,921 --> 00:32:37,390
who go to the world series of
poker and they run the numbers.

563
00:32:37,391 --> 00:32:38,171
That's how they play.

564
00:32:38,171 --> 00:32:42,140
And then there are other guys who were
completely seemingly flying by the seat

565
00:32:42,141 --> 00:32:44,030
of their pants. I mean,
they're very kinesthetic.

566
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:48,380
They're playing intimidation
game. They're very physical. Um,

567
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:53,330
and, uh, so asking myself, for instance,
who's good at this? Who shouldn't be,

568
00:32:53,331 --> 00:32:57,200
if the assumption is you have to be very
good at math to be good at poker, right?

569
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:02,840
Who, who admits to using no math,
which might be misinformation, but,

570
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:06,740
and let me look into how they do it.
And then the second question is,

571
00:33:06,741 --> 00:33:08,870
you have they replicated their results?

572
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:12,230
Are there other people they've taught to
do what they do to try to separate out

573
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:16,740
the, the nature from the
nurture where possible. But, uh,

574
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:20,000
I want to come back to, you know, the,

575
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:25,070
the finance guys just for a second and
to ask you about a rituals and routines

576
00:33:25,401 --> 00:33:29,700
and I'm going to ask you about your
own, but what are some habits, uh,

577
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:32,750
and it doesn't have to be across the board
with all these guys because they have

578
00:33:32,751 --> 00:33:36,920
such different personalities
and approaches, but with
some of these, uh, you know,

579
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:41,570
really super high level finance guys
who are managing tens of billions of

580
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:41,630
dollars,

581
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:45,250
what are some of the habits that you've
observed that you find interesting? Uh,

582
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:46,550
or rituals?

583
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:49,400
Let me answer that by describing some of

584
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:54,440
the keystone habits that I recommend
for people to internalize it and in the

585
00:33:54,441 --> 00:33:57,470
field.
Um,

586
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:01,820
what will mean first of all,
meditation. I mean we're,

587
00:34:01,821 --> 00:34:05,400
we're speaking about this
theme of cognitive biases or,

588
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:08,960
or find it basically observing your mental
dictions the moment that they said in

589
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:13,770
meditation is as deep and
as powerful a tool as, um,

590
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,770
as I could possibly describe.
I mean, it's, it's an,

591
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:20,870
and maybe six or seven years ago when I
was first talking about meditation with

592
00:34:20,871 --> 00:34:23,170
guys and the finance world,
it seemed like some woo,

593
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:25,020
strange thing for them to take on.
Um,

594
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:27,600
but as more and more people are
integrating into the process, I mean,

595
00:34:27,601 --> 00:34:30,290
you wouldn't believe how many of the
most powerful players in the world are

596
00:34:30,291 --> 00:34:35,090
meditating very deeply. Um, it's
just an amazing way of deepening, um,

597
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:38,620
deep into the creative process,
deepening presence, um,

598
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:42,670
expanding your energetic relationship
to the world, gaining insight, um,

599
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:47,860
and realizing that most of the thinking
that we do basically springs from mental

600
00:34:49,431 --> 00:34:53,810
addiction and much of people's lives
are spent in an emotional swirl,

601
00:34:53,811 --> 00:34:57,230
which is a reactive one.
And having a relationships presidents,

602
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:02,170
which allows you to see through the kind
of illusion of that emotional swirl or

603
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:05,180
those mental addictions.
I mean, meditation is an
incredibly powerful tools.

604
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:09,020
I know, you know, like deeply, I've been
meditating since I was 1718 years old.

605
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:13,010
You know, it's a big part of your
life as well, Tim. So that's a very,

606
00:35:13,011 --> 00:35:13,880
very important habit.

607
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:18,290
The idea of waking up first thing in
the morning and turning your mind to

608
00:35:18,291 --> 00:35:22,880
creative work, pre input as opposed to
checking email and getting reactive.

609
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:26,120
Um, opening up your channel
to the unconscious mind first.

610
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:27,980
Then when you wake up in
the morning doing the same,

611
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:31,410
ending the workday with
quality, hugely important. Uh,

612
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:34,970
I remember why I went skiing with Billy
Kidd, who is my recall at one of them,

613
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:38,910
the Great Danielle ratios from back in
the think the sixties Olympic ski team.

614
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:43,800
Awesome dude. Now he's, he's
out in Colorado wearing a
cowboy hat. Timeless guy.

615
00:35:43,801 --> 00:35:45,790
Brilliant Dude.
And you know,

616
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,120
he was saying to me years ago when
I first skied with them, Josh,

617
00:35:48,121 --> 00:35:50,580
what do you think of the three most
important terms of the ski run?

618
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:54,660
And you know I've asked that question
to a lot of people since and most people

619
00:35:54,661 --> 00:35:56,520
will say the middle
cause it's the hardest,

620
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:59,670
the beginning cause they're getting
momentum really describes the three most

621
00:35:59,671 --> 00:36:02,310
important terms of the ski run in the
last three before you got in the lift.

622
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:06,510
And it's a very, very subtle point. And
it, for those of you who are skiers,

623
00:36:06,511 --> 00:36:08,790
you know that you know,
that's when the slope is leveled off.

624
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,980
There's less challenge.
Most people are very sloppy.

625
00:36:10,981 --> 00:36:13,170
Then they're taking the mussels off of um,

626
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:16,110
they're taking the weight off the muscles.
They've been using that bad form.

627
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,270
Problem with that is
that on the lift ride up,

628
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:21,720
unconsciously you're internalizing and
bad body mechanics. As Billy points out,

629
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:25,310
if you were here, last returns are
precise than what you're internalizing.

630
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:30,000
Lift right up his precision. So I
kind of did this on to, you know,

631
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:32,520
the guys who are trained in
the finance world, for example,

632
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,920
ending the workday with very high quality,

633
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:38,160
which opens up for one thing.
You're,

634
00:36:38,161 --> 00:36:42,870
you're internalizing quality overnight
and were nurturing themes as well as

635
00:36:42,871 --> 00:36:44,670
skills, right? It's one
thing to learn skills,

636
00:36:44,671 --> 00:36:46,440
but the hire artists to learn themes or,

637
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:50,640
or Meta themes that will
ultimately spontaneously
opens to the amendment to the

638
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:54,890
internalization of hundreds of, of
what I would call local habits. Um,

639
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:58,560
and, and so if you're practicing
quorum or the, you're,

640
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:02,940
you're deepening the muscle of quality
and you're also focusing the unconscious

641
00:37:02,941 --> 00:37:05,610
mind them and Eric complexity, which
will then tap first thing in the morning.

642
00:37:05,611 --> 00:37:07,770
So this is a core habit.
Um,

643
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:12,420
journaling certain postmortem
procesees is reflecting on the,

644
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:16,950
you know, doing the ending your day with
a reflection on the quality of the work.

645
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:20,190
Um, what are the core areas of complexity
that you're, that you're wrestling with?

646
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:22,080
Um, hugely important. You know,

647
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,900
if
someone

648
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:35,860
I time at the end of the workday before
the problem with doing these things and

649
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:37,220
right before bed is it,

650
00:37:37,221 --> 00:37:39,680
then you're sort of consciously going
to bed thinking about these things.

651
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:43,760
At that point, I find you want to release
it. So I'm in a very core idea is,

652
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:47,660
you know, when you go home as best you
can, unless you're red hot inspired,

653
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:50,370
release your mind from the work.
Um,

654
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:54,920
it's very important to give your stress
and recovery. Um, core habit, right?

655
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:57,610
We want to be turning it on and turning
it off and keep and teaching people

656
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:02,650
people to turning it off is a huge part
of teaching them to turn on much more

657
00:38:02,721 --> 00:38:04,700
intensely.
And so stress and recovery workouts,

658
00:38:04,701 --> 00:38:08,960
interval training and meditation together,
our beautiful habits to develop,

659
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:11,630
to cultivate the art of turning
it on and turning it off.

660
00:38:11,631 --> 00:38:15,200
So if you're undulating your heart
rate, for example, between one 71 72,

661
00:38:15,201 --> 00:38:19,340
one 74 and say one 40 for the practice
of lowering your heart rate over the

662
00:38:19,341 --> 00:38:23,270
course of say,
45 seconds is akin to falling asleep,

663
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:28,280
releasing your tension. Um, and then as
you're pushing your heart rate back up,

664
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:32,300
you're learning and turn it on is you're
using a physical metaphor to train at

665
00:38:32,301 --> 00:38:36,750
the art of turning on
incredible intellectual and
then turn it off Marcel with,

666
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:41,020
see if we were talking about one of my
most beautiful memories of him and you

667
00:38:41,021 --> 00:38:43,510
know, world championship fight
before going into the semifinals.

668
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,210
Bronchus bleacher, everyone's
screaming, yell, and he's sleeping,

669
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,200
sleep,
wake them up.

670
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:49,750
He sort of stumbled into the ring.

671
00:38:49,751 --> 00:38:53,230
You've never seen a guy more relaxed
before going into a world championship

672
00:38:53,231 --> 00:38:57,730
fight. Um, and then he can turn it off so
deeply in man, when he goes in the ring,

673
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:59,860
you can't turn on with any
more intensity than he can.

674
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:04,210
And his ability to turn it off is directly
aligned with how intensely you can

675
00:39:04,211 --> 00:39:06,850
turn it on.
So training people to do this,

676
00:39:06,851 --> 00:39:11,560
have stress and recovery
undulation throughout their
day. Um, and then, you know,

677
00:39:11,561 --> 00:39:14,930
thematically this ties into
again, this internal, um,

678
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:18,880
proactive orientation and you know,
building a daily architecture,

679
00:39:18,881 --> 00:39:23,770
which is around understanding your
creative process as opposed to reacting to

680
00:39:23,771 --> 00:39:25,630
things,
feeling guilty that you're not working,

681
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:29,420
really teaching people to tap
into their internal compass. Um,

682
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:31,930
so those are some of the core
themes and habits that I would,

683
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:35,350
that I would bring up first,
but I could go on,

684
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,380
I could spend three hours
talking about this. Okay.

685
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:43,510
A little important to

686
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,110
touch on for a second.
I mean, as you know,

687
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,880
I've been taking that very
seriously for particularly,

688
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:54,420
particularly last six months or so.

689
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:59,690
And I received an email
the other day from the, uh,

690
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:02,380
the teacher that I used for
a transcendental meditation.

691
00:40:02,381 --> 00:40:04,930
And there are many different
types of meditation. I'm curious,

692
00:40:04,931 --> 00:40:08,800
I'm going to ask you about what, how you
format your own meditating in a second.

693
00:40:08,801 --> 00:40:11,980
But there are many different types.
I have my issues,

694
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:15,380
my likes and dislikes as it relates
to almost all of them, but, uh,

695
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:18,900
received an email with a link
to an article, uh, in the,

696
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:23,320
the title is Bridgewater founder Ray Daleo
credits transcendental meditation for

697
00:40:23,321 --> 00:40:26,050
his success.
And for those who don't know,

698
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:29,380
he's the founder of the world's largest
hedge fund, Bridgewater associates.

699
00:40:29,381 --> 00:40:34,060
They have what, 100 billion
plus under under management,
I think. Um, and his quote,

700
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:36,910
his quote is meditation more than any
other factor has been the secret to

701
00:40:36,911 --> 00:40:40,780
whatever success I've had, uh, that
that is a hell of an endorsement.

702
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:45,250
So it's, for me, it's been, uh,

703
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:49,960
getting over that resistance to what I
perceived as sort of a woo new agey type

704
00:40:49,961 --> 00:40:52,810
thing. Um, and the, uh,

705
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:57,760
the ability to sort of view it almost
as just a warm bath for the mind.

706
00:40:57,930 --> 00:41:01,450
That where I'm taking a mini
vacation from my own brain in a way,

707
00:41:01,451 --> 00:41:04,280
which may or may not
depending on who you ask,

708
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:08,260
be the most helpful way to look at it.
But I found that a very,

709
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:13,090
very kind of useful lens through
which to view it. But how do you,

710
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:16,680
uh, what, what, uh, if there
is a particular type of,
of meditation you followed,

711
00:41:16,681 --> 00:41:20,980
what is it or how do you
personally meditate? I mean,

712
00:41:20,981 --> 00:41:23,500
what do you think of or not think
of? How long do you do it, et Cetera?

713
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:34,430
Very simple, contemplative
Buddhist sitting meditation.

714
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:38,030
Um, or I would focus on my breath. Um,

715
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:41,390
and you know,

716
00:41:41,391 --> 00:41:46,391
this is when I was a late teenager and
then I started getting involved with Tai

717
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:49,460
Chi and I started studying East
Asian philosophy very deeply.

718
00:41:49,461 --> 00:41:53,730
And this is where I got increasingly
into moving meditation, which,

719
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:58,250
which is the most deep practice or the
practice that I've personally done most

720
00:41:58,251 --> 00:42:00,940
deeply Tai Chi for meditation.
I,

721
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:05,470
so the medics data form
of techy is sort of the,

722
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:06,620
the essence of the art.

723
00:42:06,621 --> 00:42:08,720
And then the fighting application
is what I was competing in.

724
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:14,300
And so I spent many years
meditating for five,

725
00:42:14,301 --> 00:42:17,470
six hours a day, three
tight with techy. Um,

726
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:22,320
today I combine my, my tattoo practice
with sitting meditation again.

727
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:27,050
Um, well most people when they,
when they enter meditation, what I,

728
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:29,960
what I suggested, they just practice
very simple sitting meditation.

729
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:33,770
I'm following the breath and it's a
practice which doesn't have to be very

730
00:42:33,771 --> 00:42:35,420
complex.
They can for example,

731
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:40,720
just sit either cross legged
or comfortably in a chair
and have their and follow

732
00:42:40,881 --> 00:42:41,540
their breath.

733
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:44,180
And it's very interesting because they'll
notice after one or two seconds of

734
00:42:44,181 --> 00:42:45,230
their mind starts racing off.

735
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:48,680
And usually what happens when you have
really driven guys who are trying to

736
00:42:48,681 --> 00:42:51,240
meditate for the first time and
their mind races off, they get those,

737
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:55,520
they get all pissed off,
angry frustration.

738
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:58,010
They feel like the failing at meditation.

739
00:42:58,370 --> 00:43:02,330
And one of the most important things
to do is to embrace the fact that

740
00:43:02,331 --> 00:43:05,810
meditation isn't about perfection.
It's about the return to breath.

741
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:07,490
So when you find your mind racing,

742
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:09,680
you observe that and you
return to your breath.

743
00:43:09,681 --> 00:43:11,390
And that's a tough emotional
hurdle for a lot of guys.

744
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:16,310
And it's very interesting because over
time, you know, you know, the metaphor of,

745
00:43:16,311 --> 00:43:18,060
of basically the mind is a,

746
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:22,580
is a wild stallion that over time your
attainment and you ultimately learn to

747
00:43:22,581 --> 00:43:26,300
still at its racing, it's fucking, it's
pulling against anything. You put it,

748
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:29,030
you paint kind of line you put on it.
Um,

749
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:33,760
but ultimately the circles get
smaller and smaller and you,

750
00:43:33,761 --> 00:43:38,761
you learn to observe when your mind is
getting caught up in some kind of mental

751
00:43:39,261 --> 00:43:41,960
or emotional addiction more
and more quickly and fluidly.

752
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:45,410
And the returning to breath becomes easier
and easier. And it's very interesting,

753
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:49,850
by the way, as a competitor
because I relate to the theme of,

754
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:53,840
of channeling and emotion or fear,
whatever is rising it. And you know,

755
00:43:53,841 --> 00:43:56,750
as a world class competitor in very
much the same way we might speak about

756
00:43:56,751 --> 00:44:01,220
meditation. Um, you know, I spoke
at a conference on grid, uh,

757
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:05,210
recently and it was very interesting
for me because for the most part when I

758
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:08,160
listened,
resilience trit yeah.

759
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:12,350
Which is of course core
educational principle and a
lot of charter schools these

760
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:15,460
days is hugely important.
Teaching kids to be resilient. Um,

761
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:17,280
and it's very interesting because what,

762
00:44:17,281 --> 00:44:22,040
when I hear people speak
about resilience, um, from,

763
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:24,770
and this is sort of a, we're moving
a little bit of size of meditation,

764
00:44:24,771 --> 00:44:29,690
but we'll bring it back. Um,
the focus is on, for example,

765
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:34,020
overcoming difficulty, um,
suffering, learning to,

766
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:36,030
to basically push through.

767
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:39,450
What people don't realize is
that world class performers,

768
00:44:39,451 --> 00:44:42,330
what they've done is they've reoriented
their relationship to suffering or that

769
00:44:42,331 --> 00:44:44,220
to the point of versus since
they've learned to embrace it,

770
00:44:44,221 --> 00:44:48,390
they've learned to see the beauty
in these moments where there's pain.

771
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:50,040
Cause that's incredible room for growth.

772
00:44:50,041 --> 00:44:54,810
And I think that a lot of what you
learned to do in meditation is observe the

773
00:44:54,811 --> 00:44:58,770
addictive way. You might be defining
something. And if you want to,

774
00:44:58,771 --> 00:45:03,540
you can simply alter that definition so
you can change your relationship to pain

775
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:08,550
or the rain or a huge
storm or fear or anger.

776
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:13,110
So for example, people from the outside,
we'll use the term fearlessness, right?

777
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:19,100
But if you speak to any great soldier or
a seal team member or a fighter or UFC

778
00:45:19,141 --> 00:45:23,130
guy, they'll tell you mixed martial law,
right? You know, world class fighters,

779
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:25,230
they'll tell you that they feel fear.

780
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:27,300
They just know how to sit with their
fear and how to work with it and how to

781
00:45:27,301 --> 00:45:28,134
channel it.

782
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:32,640
So the idea of fearlessness is sort of
a false idea which is imposed from the

783
00:45:32,641 --> 00:45:35,220
outside by a spectator.
Um,

784
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:37,950
and when you observe
world class performers,

785
00:45:37,951 --> 00:45:42,330
what they've learned how to do
is harness fear, nerves, anxiety,

786
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:44,250
bring them in,
embraced them,

787
00:45:44,251 --> 00:45:46,890
have a working relationship with
them and channel them into intensity.

788
00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:50,490
And Meditation is an
incredible forum or vehicle,

789
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:54,210
which you can do this because you learn
to observe where you have addictive

790
00:45:54,211 --> 00:45:57,750
relationships and you realize that
they're not absolute and you can actually

791
00:45:57,751 --> 00:46:02,310
transform your relationship
to any of these thought
patterns, thought, Constructs,

792
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:04,500
cognitive biases,
what emotional patterns.

793
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:12,760
But it's one of my favorite quotes, who,

794
00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:17,670
boxers like Floyd Patterson,
you know, Jose Torres,

795
00:46:17,671 --> 00:46:19,320
most famously perhaps Mike Tyson.

796
00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:24,420
And he would say to the hero and
the coward both feel the same thing,

797
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:27,780
but the hero of uses this fear of projects
it onto his opponent while the coward

798
00:46:27,781 --> 00:46:31,050
runs. It's the same thing. Fear, but
it's what you do with it that matters.

799
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:33,980
And I,
uh,

800
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:38,370
I started meditating and
gave up meditating many,

801
00:46:38,371 --> 00:46:40,530
many times because I had the,

802
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:43,890
the response that you mentioned about
type a personalities where I'd be sitting

803
00:46:43,891 --> 00:46:46,050
there and I thought the
objective was to quiet my mind.

804
00:46:46,051 --> 00:46:48,450
And I'll come back to that in a second.
And so when,

805
00:46:48,451 --> 00:46:52,620
so when I failed at quieting my mind
because it would be ticking off the to do

806
00:46:52,621 --> 00:46:53,470
list or being Aiga,

807
00:46:53,590 --> 00:46:56,880
that fucker who said B and c to me the
other day and it was just like harp on

808
00:46:56,881 --> 00:46:59,850
these ridiculous things and I'd get then
pissed and then I'd get pissed that I

809
00:46:59,851 --> 00:47:04,851
was getting pissed and get up and have a
cup of coffee and like storm out of the

810
00:47:05,461 --> 00:47:09,960
house, which didn't seem like a
productive meditation session. Um,

811
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:13,870
I actually started doing
it consistently when, uh,

812
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:17,520
I kept it really short and a friend
of mine recommended this where I would

813
00:47:17,521 --> 00:47:22,380
number one be comfortable. So I would, I
would sit down, but to avoid back pain,

814
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:23,760
I would actually lean against a wall,

815
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:25,860
which is very commonly
thought of as a big no, no.

816
00:47:25,861 --> 00:47:29,620
So it would lean against a wall to keep
my back straight and I would listen to

817
00:47:29,621 --> 00:47:34,180
one music track. I listened to one song
every morning, the same song as a Q.

818
00:47:34,181 --> 00:47:39,181
And I would just pay attention
to my breath and focus on
being an observer of my

819
00:47:40,451 --> 00:47:42,910
thoughts,
but not trying to control them at all.

820
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:46,510
So if all I did was think about my to
do list the entire time, that's fine.

821
00:47:46,511 --> 00:47:51,511
As long as I'm paying attention to my
breath and that non attachment to an

822
00:47:51,850 --> 00:47:55,580
outcome I controlling my thoughts
was, was very helpful. And the,

823
00:47:55,590 --> 00:48:00,210
the format that I followed
subsequent to that. Um, and you know,

824
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:03,460
we can have a longer conversation
about why it finally clicked,

825
00:48:03,461 --> 00:48:04,960
but the short answer is accountability.

826
00:48:04,961 --> 00:48:08,470
I had a teacher who was going to
give me a hard time if I didn't do my

827
00:48:08,471 --> 00:48:13,060
meditating and then report
back, uh, was toy 20 minutes,

828
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:15,010
let's just say 10 to
20 minutes twice a day.

829
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:20,040
And when I found was by allowing the
thoughts to occur and not judging myself,

830
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:24,880
because let's say I'm thinking about
email or the grocery shopping I need to do

831
00:48:24,881 --> 00:48:28,750
or whatever, just letting that happen.
But getting good at observing it,

832
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:33,940
I was able to then have more
emotional awareness and later,

833
00:48:33,941 --> 00:48:37,810
which would prevent cognitive
biases and bad judgments.

834
00:48:37,811 --> 00:48:42,640
So what I mean by that is, as a concrete
example, uh, I'm a, I'm an impatient guy.

835
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:46,780
I always have been ever since I was a
little, literally little kid, like 12,

836
00:48:46,781 --> 00:48:50,050
13 years old, if I was at the
restaurant with my mom and dad and,

837
00:48:50,090 --> 00:48:54,340
and the server didn't come over and pour
water after we'd been gone dry for like

838
00:48:54,341 --> 00:48:54,761
five minutes,

839
00:48:54,761 --> 00:48:57,260
I'd just get up and walk into the
kitchen and like grab a picture and walk

840
00:48:57,261 --> 00:49:02,140
lockup. And, uh, I'm really impatient and,

841
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:03,700
uh,
I get angry.

842
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:08,560
I get angry about things that I view
as deliberately slow and sloppy.

843
00:49:08,561 --> 00:49:11,610
So for me, uh, and,

844
00:49:11,611 --> 00:49:14,950
and that anger can be harnessed sometimes
and do really productive aggression,

845
00:49:14,951 --> 00:49:17,740
but it's also, it wears
you down and both ends. Um,

846
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:22,630
and so what I've found is after meditating
consistently for even a week or so,

847
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:26,560
uh,
when that anger would start,

848
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:30,520
I was better at not just become,

849
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:35,580
I was better at observing
Tim as a third person,

850
00:49:35,711 --> 00:49:37,420
right? Like, oh, look at that.

851
00:49:37,421 --> 00:49:41,020
Like Tim's getting angry about
something really small and stupid, uh,

852
00:49:41,230 --> 00:49:45,310
as opposed to simply becoming angry
and then causing problems for myself,

853
00:49:45,311 --> 00:49:49,440
whether it's just internal or interacting
with other people. So, uh, yeah,

854
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:52,780
I agree with you completely on,
on the meditation and

855
00:49:54,690 --> 00:49:58,970
12 year old racing into the kitchen
and bring up a metaphor for your life.

856
00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:12,170
Let's, let's do a couple of
rapid fire questions that are,

857
00:50:12,171 --> 00:50:14,300
that are all tied into
this, this, this stuff.

858
00:50:14,301 --> 00:50:18,450
But we can just do short questions
with a couple of short answers. Um,

859
00:50:19,970 --> 00:50:24,950
so complete the following statement.
My favorite time of day is blank.

860
00:50:25,850 --> 00:50:30,850
My favorite time of day is holding my son
in my arms after I've done my woken up

861
00:50:32,001 --> 00:50:35,250
within a 20, 30 minutes journaling
session. And I get my son, I can,

862
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:39,040
I bring him downstairs and I give him
his bottle of milk and I hold them.

863
00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:43,130
And I looked at him in the eye and I
told them how proud I am of them and we

864
00:50:43,131 --> 00:50:46,660
talk about what he's thinking about and
what he's working on. Willie I smell can.

865
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:49,520
I think it's the most magical
part of my day these days

866
00:50:49,990 --> 00:50:50,823
in the morning.

867
00:50:51,310 --> 00:50:51,760
Okay.

868
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,910
Yeah, that's a, I wake up, I wake
up about half an hour before him.

869
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:59,950
I do a big creative burst. Um,
this has been, as a parent,

870
00:50:59,951 --> 00:51:02,710
your sleep patterns change
pretty dramatically,

871
00:51:02,711 --> 00:51:05,750
but I found this rhythm where I
wake up and I do that personally.

872
00:51:05,950 --> 00:51:10,330
I just love that first morning energy
Tom with him and we have this deep

873
00:51:10,331 --> 00:51:14,020
connection while he's
having his, um, his milk.

874
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:16,360
What time do you wake up?

875
00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:22,770
I usually wake up around seven seven
oh five and he's usually wake up around

876
00:51:24,101 --> 00:51:25,240
seven 37 35.

877
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:27,280
I'm endlessly fascinated by

878
00:51:30,550 --> 00:51:34,150
digging. I'm digging into the
minutia. But when you wake up,

879
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:39,400
it sounded like you wake up and you have
30 minutes to journal before bringing

880
00:51:39,401 --> 00:51:42,810
your son downstairs. Do you brush
your teeth, drink a cup of coffee,

881
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:46,180
any of that before you journal
or do you just roll out of bed,

882
00:51:46,210 --> 00:51:47,950
walk into the office
and sit down to write?

883
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:52,770
I
brush my teeth.

884
00:51:53,070 --> 00:51:58,070
I go downstairs and I sit down with
my journal and I started writing and I

885
00:51:58,530 --> 00:52:03,300
immediately applied myself to two or
reflection that I sort of targeted my mind

886
00:52:03,301 --> 00:52:08,290
at [inaudible] and evening
or late afternoon before. Um,

887
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:12,750
and then when I, when after and I just
let it rip, I have a big creative search.

888
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:15,510
Um, and then once I hear my
son, I go get them. And then,

889
00:52:16,690 --> 00:52:20,770
then I have my breakfast,
um, usually, uh, below,

890
00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:23,190
um, while he has his, you know,

891
00:52:23,191 --> 00:52:26,850
after he has his note and then I have a
cup of coffee about half an hour after

892
00:52:26,851 --> 00:52:27,684
that

893
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:32,180
related to me,
the happy guy.

894
00:52:32,350 --> 00:52:37,100
Obviously we all have our
challenges then and again,

895
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:42,490
uh,
like a remodeled at the moment.

896
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:50,830
I won't go into a diatribe at the moment.
I'm very excited about it, but it's my,

897
00:52:50,831 --> 00:52:51,381
uh,
you know,

898
00:52:51,381 --> 00:52:54,580
a 12 year old Tim wanting to go get the
water pitchers is not being very helpful

899
00:52:54,581 --> 00:52:58,180
right now. The, what are three things?

900
00:52:58,230 --> 00:53:01,180
It can be two or three things that you
believe you need in order to be happy.

901
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:05,080
And that can be for you. Uh, it could be
for people in general. I'm just curious.

902
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:09,730
Uh, what, how you would think of that
question or answer that question.

903
00:53:10,890 --> 00:53:11,723
Okay.

904
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:17,420
Being different and having
these conversations is that
you tend to be very good

905
00:53:17,421 --> 00:53:18,254
at thinking and bullets.

906
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:21,870
I can tell you the
essence of how I really,

907
00:53:23,470 --> 00:53:26,550
I'm not going to give you three
bullet answer cause I just,

908
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:28,170
that's just not how this brain operates.

909
00:53:31,190 --> 00:53:35,450
Built a lifestyle around
being true to myself. Largely.

910
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:37,700
Maybe a big reason is because of,
you know,

911
00:53:37,701 --> 00:53:41,930
my mom used to always tell me as a kid
to follow my heart, follow my dreams. Um,

912
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:46,930
I never made decisions for money
or for external things. Um,

913
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:51,500
and it was trusted. If I was true to
myself, these things would follow. And so,

914
00:53:52,010 --> 00:53:54,950
you know, my professional
life, my foundation, my school,

915
00:53:55,520 --> 00:54:00,520
I only work with people who I feel are
ethically aligned to have a good energy,

916
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:05,000
who I feel really good about intuitively.
Um,

917
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:08,220
I keep empty space in my life.
Um,

918
00:54:08,330 --> 00:54:11,230
I rarely have more than one
or two meetings a day. Um,

919
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:15,530
my life is about quality and not quantity
and it's about depth and not breadth.

920
00:54:16,010 --> 00:54:18,710
Um,
I businesses based on doing very,

921
00:54:18,711 --> 00:54:23,030
very deep and very a excellent work,
work with just a handful of people.

922
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:27,080
And so I really liked to cultivate
quality as a way of life.

923
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:29,750
And I believe that when you're
not cultivating quality,

924
00:54:29,751 --> 00:54:32,330
you're essentially cultivating
sloppiness. And so, you know,

925
00:54:32,490 --> 00:54:36,350
the idea of building the musculature of
quality and being like a heat seeking

926
00:54:36,351 --> 00:54:36,830
missile form.

927
00:54:36,830 --> 00:54:41,000
And I take great pleasure in observing
the beauty of the little moments in life.

928
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:46,130
Um, and so for me, my lifestyle is based
on, you know, I'm working out every day.

929
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:50,090
I just focused on structured and data
will allow for my creative process to be

930
00:54:50,091 --> 00:54:53,480
rich. I'm present with my son.
I have my office is at home,

931
00:54:53,910 --> 00:54:56,330
I'm with them in the morning, I'm with
him, I see him throughout the day.

932
00:54:56,331 --> 00:54:59,230
I'm with him, give him his bath
and read them a story. And I,

933
00:54:59,231 --> 00:55:03,750
and with them I've eliminated almost
all travel. That takes me away. Um,

934
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:07,090
from, from my boy going to
a conference this weekend,

935
00:55:07,091 --> 00:55:10,600
I'm taking my wife and my baby
are coming with me. Um, and I,

936
00:55:10,601 --> 00:55:15,601
I really build a life around being true
and I don't build it around anything

937
00:55:15,921 --> 00:55:16,754
material.

938
00:55:17,090 --> 00:55:20,600
And that's really the essence of how
I personally relate to this question.

939
00:55:20,601 --> 00:55:22,500
Of course there's different
solutions for everybody, but um,

940
00:55:22,990 --> 00:55:24,110
works for me.

941
00:55:31,190 --> 00:55:34,670
I think it's a goal that most people
have at least in the abstract.

942
00:55:34,671 --> 00:55:36,440
But I'd love to dig into

943
00:55:38,150 --> 00:55:41,840
some concrete details of that.
Perhaps you could share

944
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:45,620
an example of something you changed,

945
00:55:45,630 --> 00:55:50,090
like maybe where you got slightly off
the path and made a correction to be true

946
00:55:50,091 --> 00:55:51,680
to yourself and what that looked like.

947
00:55:56,730 --> 00:56:01,400
A very clear example is my public life.
So I was a young kid,

948
00:56:01,401 --> 00:56:04,120
fell in love with chess when I was,

949
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:08,510
I won my first national championship
when I was a lead eight, early nine.

950
00:56:09,050 --> 00:56:12,600
Um, when I was 11, a book came
out searching for I Fisher. Um,

951
00:56:12,690 --> 00:56:17,420
and then when I was 15 movie came out
about my life based on the same book that

952
00:56:17,421 --> 00:56:21,050
my dad initially wrote. And
so I was really thrust into
the spotlight. And so I,

953
00:56:21,410 --> 00:56:25,150
you know, without me wanting
to, I was just, you know, a
young, passionate artist.

954
00:56:25,151 --> 00:56:26,860
I love playing chess
and competing and chest.

955
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:31,420
I was put out there and I had Paparazzi
following me everywhere. I was, um,

956
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:33,440
you know, I was really living in the, in,

957
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:37,750
in the spotlight in a way I wasn't
necessarily emotionally prepared for.

958
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:43,000
And I felt in my teens how that challenged
my love for this art cause my love

959
00:56:43,001 --> 00:56:46,300
for it was so pure initially. Um, and,

960
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:51,370
and that tension, you know, that that
fight, that fight to stay true to my art,

961
00:56:51,730 --> 00:56:54,190
um,
taught me some very deep lessons.

962
00:56:54,191 --> 00:56:56,740
And then I know after
I finished high school,

963
00:56:56,741 --> 00:56:59,330
I took off and I left the
country largely to study chess.

964
00:56:59,331 --> 00:57:03,930
Very deeply undistracted from publicity.
I moved to Eastern Europe. Um,

965
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:07,600
my girlfriend at the time
was from Slovenia. Um,

966
00:57:07,601 --> 00:57:11,200
no one knew me out there and it was a
beautiful life and I just left the public

967
00:57:11,201 --> 00:57:14,020
world. And since then have,
you know, when I came back,

968
00:57:14,021 --> 00:57:17,570
I've had these periods where I've been
exposed to publicity and I've been

969
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:21,580
periods where I've been deep in the
cave and moved away from it. And,

970
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:26,440
and I think that this is a very clean
example of, I mean, other than you

971
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:28,753
drag me out,

972
00:57:33,210 --> 00:57:34,760
you have a way of doing that to me,

973
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:40,590
but in a beautiful way. And I mean, I,
I've found that the privacy of my life,

974
00:57:41,190 --> 00:57:44,890
I'm not doing things,
not getting caught up in,

975
00:57:44,950 --> 00:57:49,950
in the swirl of fame or seeking external
adulation is a very important thing for

976
00:57:50,911 --> 00:57:55,230
me personally. Everyone's different.
But, but for me, I mean, I am amazed,

977
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:59,460
maybe I have a little bit of
a, um, an over sensitivity
to this because of, of my,

978
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:03,360
my youth, because I was out there so
intensely as a young, as a young guy.

979
00:58:03,390 --> 00:58:07,840
And I think it really challenged
my love for the game. Um,

980
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:11,850
and this is an example of the kind
of decision that I'll make. I mean,

981
00:58:11,851 --> 00:58:14,080
I think it's very important for me to,
to,

982
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:17,160
to live the vast majority
of my life privately.

983
00:58:17,190 --> 00:58:21,000
I don't do very much that will allow
me to be recognized in the street and

984
00:58:21,001 --> 00:58:24,330
living my life as a celebrity because
I've gone down that path and I,

985
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:26,670
I love my prophecy.
Um,

986
00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:31,620
and I also have built a career around my
business is working with people who are

987
00:58:31,621 --> 00:58:33,330
similar,
who are not seeking the limelight,

988
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:36,710
who are not out there on television
every day, who are world class, but her,

989
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:40,590
no one around them. Um, other
than people, you know, very close,

990
00:58:40,890 --> 00:58:44,880
had any idea that they have been so
incredibly successful from a monetary way.

991
00:58:44,881 --> 00:58:48,420
They try to raise their kids,
um, not to be spoiled. Um,

992
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:53,370
the kids are gritty kids there,
you know, great philanthropists,

993
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:56,820
um, really good people.
And you know, I love,

994
00:58:56,821 --> 00:59:00,390
I'm very drawn to people who have
been enormous to successful, um,

995
00:59:01,230 --> 00:59:06,230
but don't get caught up in the external
crap that comes with success and a real,

996
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:11,300
you know, who were living their
life, tapped into the love. Um,

997
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:12,510
and that's how I try to lift.

998
00:59:16,110 --> 00:59:17,520
What are the books

999
00:59:21,650 --> 00:59:26,650
either most gifted to other people
or most recommended to other people.

1000
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:30,170
Uh, because there are many people
listening to this probably who

1001
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:36,270
won't necessarily have the opportunity
to interact with the types of,

1002
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:38,360
of high level folks, uh, that,

1003
00:59:38,361 --> 00:59:41,750
that you and I are so fortunate to
have the chance to interact with,

1004
00:59:41,751 --> 00:59:46,520
but they can do that. Visa
the books or narratives, uh,

1005
00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:47,790
documentaries,
et cetera.

1006
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:50,630
What are some books that have
had a formative impact on you?

1007
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:57,810
A huge impact on my life,
on the road, Dharma bums.

1008
01:00:00,450 --> 01:00:05,370
His books were initially kind of taps
me into the idea that life could be

1009
01:00:05,371 --> 01:00:08,530
ecstatically beautiful. And
I moved into studying, um,

1010
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:12,750
that wasn't so loud to the
Dao de Jing. Hugely. Um,

1011
01:00:12,870 --> 01:00:16,440
just unbelievably deep for the course of
translation of that book that you read

1012
01:00:16,441 --> 01:00:17,550
will be formative.
And I,

1013
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:22,140
my favorite translation is the GF who
sang and Jane English translation of the

1014
01:00:22,141 --> 01:00:25,350
diversion, um, Zen and the
art of motorcycle maintenance.

1015
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:29,160
I think one of the most important books
ever written by Robert Person who has

1016
01:00:29,161 --> 01:00:32,810
become a very dear friend over
the years. He, he, he, when my,

1017
01:00:33,060 --> 01:00:34,800
when the order of learning came
out and my publisher asked me,

1018
01:00:34,801 --> 01:00:37,290
who would you love to read
this book? And I said, well,

1019
01:00:37,291 --> 01:00:41,310
the one person that really want to
read that book is, um, Robert Person.

1020
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:44,010
And to me that it was just, you know, he,

1021
01:00:44,020 --> 01:00:47,730
he lived like a deeply secluded life.
Um,

1022
01:00:48,090 --> 01:00:50,070
but they somehow manage to
get them a copy of the book.

1023
01:00:50,071 --> 01:00:53,460
He got an a big Bushel from his publisher
and he read it and he contacted me and

1024
01:00:53,461 --> 01:00:56,430
wrote, I mean, I was so honored that he,
that he was moved by it. And he and I,

1025
01:00:56,431 --> 01:00:59,440
and over the years it developed
really interesting dialogue. Um,

1026
01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:02,400
is that his motorcycle maintenance is one,

1027
01:01:02,401 --> 01:01:05,760
I think one of the most important books
in the world. The focus on quality,

1028
01:01:05,761 --> 01:01:07,030
dynamic, quality, um,

1029
01:01:07,290 --> 01:01:11,730
finding art in learning the
fine art in anything equally,

1030
01:01:11,731 --> 01:01:15,870
deeply brilliant. Um,
philosophical book. Um,

1031
01:01:16,830 --> 01:01:21,470
shanter on one of the most
beautiful novels I have. I
never had Gregory Roberts.

1032
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:26,010
Also someone I've gotten to know very
well. Um, just to ecstatically beautiful,

1033
01:01:26,070 --> 01:01:29,130
beautiful book. And you know, of course
I'm also a lover of fiction. I mean,

1034
01:01:29,131 --> 01:01:33,710
Hemingway has been, he's probably the
most important writer of my life. Um,

1035
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:37,490
almost everything of his effort.
Any particular novel stand out for you?

1036
01:01:41,590 --> 01:01:44,530
I mean,
I think that for whom the bell tolls,

1037
01:01:44,531 --> 01:01:48,550
just exquisite novel of Green
Hills of Africa. Amazing. Um,

1038
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:53,380
his short stories are utterly magnificent.
Um,

1039
01:01:53,770 --> 01:01:55,390
I think green hills of
Africa is one of the most,

1040
01:01:55,510 --> 01:01:57,550
is one of the most underrated
books that he's written.

1041
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:02,140
His is complete collection
of short stories.

1042
01:02:02,141 --> 01:02:05,290
I mean there's one magnificent
gem after the next, um,

1043
01:02:05,590 --> 01:02:09,910
of course old man and the sea is,
everyone thinks about and beautiful book.

1044
01:02:10,450 --> 01:02:13,450
Um, I guess if I had to have
a favorite, it would be,

1045
01:02:13,451 --> 01:02:14,530
it would be for whom the bell tolls

1046
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:21,740
insight into his writing style.
Uh,

1047
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:24,000
a moveable feast is okay.

1048
01:02:24,090 --> 01:02:28,530
Magnificent book. Yeah. Yeah. Also
really speaks to his writing process.

1049
01:02:29,490 --> 01:02:33,810
So fascinating. Uh, there's a
great book, by the way, Tim,

1050
01:02:34,610 --> 01:02:35,460
I think you've read

1051
01:02:38,490 --> 01:02:43,230
Hemingway and writing this book. I
did read it. I also read that, yeah,

1052
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:46,620
you want it. If someone was just
get to know a Hemingway to do,

1053
01:02:46,670 --> 01:02:51,160
it's just a fantastic compilation of all
of Hemingway's writing and letters in

1054
01:02:51,161 --> 01:02:53,530
his books, in his articles everywhere. Um,

1055
01:02:53,620 --> 01:02:56,170
put together thematically basically
Hemingway on the writing process.

1056
01:02:56,171 --> 01:02:59,940
I think it's one of the most important
little collections of, of um,

1057
01:03:00,220 --> 01:03:02,860
on creativity that I've ever run into.
Absolutely brilliant.

1058
01:03:04,820 --> 01:03:05,830
I remember I read it,

1059
01:03:06,430 --> 01:03:11,240
read it on kindle on a short flight
that I had and just like jammed right

1060
01:03:11,241 --> 01:03:13,190
through the whole thing.
The uh,

1061
01:03:15,050 --> 01:03:19,700
one of the recommendations was
write drunk,

1062
01:03:19,701 --> 01:03:24,701
edit sober and I realized that write
drunk edit sober does not translate to

1063
01:03:25,701 --> 01:03:30,140
podcasts very well. The last podcast
that I did with a buddy Kevin Rose,

1064
01:03:30,870 --> 01:03:33,260
if you record drunk and
tried to edit sober,

1065
01:03:33,261 --> 01:03:35,420
it doesn't really
actually work the same way

1066
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:41,540
a man.
What a,

1067
01:03:42,580 --> 01:03:45,800
and we'll just do a couple more
questions because this has been fun. The,

1068
01:03:46,550 --> 01:03:51,320
but if you had to run out of your house
and just take a handful of things with

1069
01:03:51,321 --> 01:03:55,280
you, obviously your family is safe
so that that's accounted for. Uh,

1070
01:03:55,340 --> 01:03:56,600
what would you take and why

1071
01:03:58,380 --> 01:04:02,610
and what kind of situation
in a very dangerous tuition

1072
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:07,830
you don't have to fend for yourself with,
with weaponry or,

1073
01:04:07,831 --> 01:04:12,050
or create fire with Flint or
anything like that. Um, there's a,

1074
01:04:12,110 --> 01:04:13,230
there's a fire in your house,

1075
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:16,930
you just have to get out to the street
and then you're going to obviously sort

1076
01:04:16,931 --> 01:04:21,760
things out later, but assuming your
family is safe, uh, what would you,

1077
01:04:21,820 --> 01:04:24,370
what would you take with you?
You just what you can carry basically.

1078
01:04:26,470 --> 01:04:27,303
Yeah.

1079
01:04:36,910 --> 01:04:39,650
How crazy it was. I
was, um, there was, uh,

1080
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:43,460
I was studying chess with his brilliant
Russian grand masters [inaudible] who

1081
01:04:43,461 --> 01:04:47,030
actually wrote about my book. And
there was a, I was in the fifth,

1082
01:04:47,031 --> 01:04:51,740
fifth floor of a walkup through the old
one bedroom. I had my first apartment.

1083
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:53,150
And um,

1084
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:56,240
and there was something that we were deep
deep into chest study and there was a

1085
01:04:56,241 --> 01:04:59,080
huge fire.
I looked at,

1086
01:04:59,081 --> 01:05:02,430
there were like five fire engines and
dude screaming at us and we had it,

1087
01:05:02,470 --> 01:05:03,420
did it go out the fire escape.

1088
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:06,520
And I ended up going back in and grabbing
my computer with all my chest analysis,

1089
01:05:06,521 --> 01:05:07,390
which is just a random thing.

1090
01:05:12,970 --> 01:05:16,180
Yeah. And it ended up being, we had been
seconds from being an updraft in bloom,

1091
01:05:16,181 --> 01:05:20,350
the whole building on, um,
yeah. So I wouldn't do that.

1092
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:23,440
Think
honestly,

1093
01:05:23,441 --> 01:05:25,890
when you asked me the question now
I think that my family was safe.

1094
01:05:26,730 --> 01:05:30,530
I have nothing material that I would,
that I would grab.

1095
01:05:35,660 --> 01:05:39,850
Uh, all right. I'm going
to ask you one more,

1096
01:05:39,990 --> 01:05:43,690
uh, actually in, I'll give
you a choice of two questions.

1097
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:50,070
So the first option is what did
you want to be when you grew up,

1098
01:05:51,130 --> 01:05:54,780
when you were a kid,
and now how would you answer the question?

1099
01:05:55,020 --> 01:05:57,870
What do you want to be when you grow
up? That's, that's question one.

1100
01:05:58,110 --> 01:06:01,170
Question number two is if
you had a committee of three
people living or dead to

1101
01:06:01,171 --> 01:06:02,910
help you make decisions,
who would you choose and why?

1102
01:06:05,650 --> 01:06:06,860
These are great questions,
man.

1103
01:06:07,110 --> 01:06:08,640
Thanks. Um, by, by the way,

1104
01:06:08,641 --> 01:06:13,230
I'm borrowing liberally from like every
good interviewer I've ever come in

1105
01:06:13,231 --> 01:06:16,440
contact. But, so it goes

1106
01:06:17,310 --> 01:06:19,400
and we answer them. Both of you
have an answer, one of them, uh,

1107
01:06:19,510 --> 01:06:22,180
you can answer very different
questions. I mean, this is tough man.

1108
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:25,150
Yeah. I mean if they, if they, uh, I'm
just trying to be respectful of your time,

1109
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:28,030
but if you have time and you have
some thoughts on both, let's, let's,

1110
01:06:28,070 --> 01:06:28,903
let's go for it.

1111
01:06:29,750 --> 01:06:34,310
When I grew up, when I was a kid, I wanted
to be a professional baseball player.

1112
01:06:34,311 --> 01:06:38,270
I just love, I love them. So
there's something about sports. Um,

1113
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:42,780
so I think that there was a, I'm going
to, and I spend a lot of my life as a,

1114
01:06:42,781 --> 01:06:46,100
as a competitor from age
basically six until you know,

1115
01:06:46,110 --> 01:06:50,290
35. I was basically a
professional competitor field,

1116
01:06:50,970 --> 01:06:53,540
um,
today and about,

1117
01:06:53,550 --> 01:06:57,660
my mom always said to me that she felt
like that was the phase and that I was a

1118
01:06:57,661 --> 01:06:59,220
healer.
I was holding her language.

1119
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:04,900
And a lot of what I do today is try to
figure out how to help people express

1120
01:07:06,061 --> 01:07:09,900
themselves in is pure way as possible
artistically in a way that gives them joy.

1121
01:07:09,940 --> 01:07:10,290
I mean,

1122
01:07:10,290 --> 01:07:15,290
I think that my plan is sometime in the
next four or five years now I'm 37 now.

1123
01:07:17,431 --> 01:07:22,320
I'm thinking about it when I'm 40, 41. Um,
I guess that'd be three, four years now.

1124
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:24,720
Yep.

1125
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:27,540
Turn my mind to everything.

1126
01:07:27,750 --> 01:07:30,360
Taking everything I've been doing in
these different laboratories and apply it

1127
01:07:30,361 --> 01:07:34,890
to a, a world changing education
initiative. Um, helping children in, uh,

1128
01:07:35,010 --> 01:07:38,280
just fulfill themselves
in a very deep way,

1129
01:07:38,281 --> 01:07:41,380
I think is a central
column, which I'm, that's,

1130
01:07:41,381 --> 01:07:44,700
that's I'm not going to say is my
end game, but that's the next, um,

1131
01:07:44,820 --> 01:07:48,750
major chapter I think of my life that
I'm building towards and running my

1132
01:07:48,751 --> 01:07:52,380
foundation for for many years now.
And we do beautiful work,

1133
01:07:52,381 --> 01:07:55,950
but I have an allergy to scaling if
it's going to dilute quality in any way.

1134
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:59,640
And so I've been sort of
building up the foundation,

1135
01:08:00,140 --> 01:08:03,030
the ground work to ultimately be able to,

1136
01:08:03,430 --> 01:08:05,880
to do something hugely
important in education.

1137
01:08:05,881 --> 01:08:10,400
So I think that that's going to be, um,
the core of how I would, I would, um,

1138
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:12,990
I'm building towards that in a few years.
Um,

1139
01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:14,300
in terms of the committee of three people

1140
01:08:15,050 --> 01:08:16,100
to interject for a second,

1141
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:17,450
that's also,

1142
01:08:17,451 --> 01:08:21,740
I think my calling and of course
we've spoken at length about this.

1143
01:08:21,741 --> 01:08:26,420
So if you need a coconspirator
count me in for that one. Certainly

1144
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:31,393
years

1145
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:34,190
sounds like a plan.

1146
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:41,670
Taps that movement away from
self as a competitor. You're,

1147
01:08:41,671 --> 01:08:46,400
you're constantly, you're fighting and
in many ways you're, you know, you're,

1148
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:49,850
there's something about the
focus inward on oneself and I,

1149
01:08:50,580 --> 01:08:54,480
and becoming a paradigm. I've
definitely felt this movement. Um,

1150
01:08:55,020 --> 01:08:57,860
it's away from that. I mean, my,
my son is just my love for him,

1151
01:08:58,140 --> 01:09:02,040
so transcend anything I ever, I
ever felt before. It's been really,

1152
01:09:02,130 --> 01:09:05,040
really important to experience
when you become a dad man,

1153
01:09:05,041 --> 01:09:07,660
then we're going to have some fun.
What would you have sleepless nights?

1154
01:09:07,780 --> 01:09:09,650
Oh Man.
You're going to see,

1155
01:09:19,570 --> 01:09:20,403
what are your thoughts?

1156
01:09:28,940 --> 01:09:33,600
Well, one person who would be on
that committee as someone who,

1157
01:09:33,601 --> 01:09:38,410
um, who I know very, very deep friend
of mine who happens to be in the,

1158
01:09:39,010 --> 01:09:40,530
in the finance world,

1159
01:09:42,940 --> 01:09:47,640
I can't speak about his last
name is deeply meditative spirit,

1160
01:09:47,820 --> 01:09:52,050
great wisdom, um, as insightful human
beings I've ever known in my life.

1161
01:09:52,051 --> 01:09:55,800
And I think that that he would
definitely be on, um, on that list.

1162
01:09:56,610 --> 01:10:00,410
Um, I mean, can we go,
can we go into kick?

1163
01:10:00,411 --> 01:10:03,870
Can I say outrageous?
There's like, like Gandhi.

1164
01:10:04,050 --> 01:10:04,883
Yeah,

1165
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:10,900
I mean I think of that
Gandhi loud,

1166
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:13,720
the Buddha. I mean, my God, what, what,

1167
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:18,210
what am but if she needs
to be is a certain,

1168
01:10:18,660 --> 01:10:21,570
yeah. I don't know, man. I don't
know if I can answer this question.

1169
01:10:21,571 --> 01:10:25,610
Very intelligent. Like
you could put it, yeah.

1170
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:30,080
I don't know. And Tim, of
course you, man, you give me,

1171
01:10:30,150 --> 01:10:31,910
you give me so much crap in life

1172
01:10:34,050 --> 01:10:36,040
you because you'd be the one just to,
just to keep,

1173
01:10:36,420 --> 01:10:41,320
definitely be wanting displays through
all the nonsense yet. And my mom,

1174
01:10:41,420 --> 01:10:46,260
that's the most important one. My
mom, she has given me the most, um,

1175
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:48,940
deep advice in my life.
I mean,

1176
01:10:48,941 --> 01:10:53,941
my mom is the one person who has really
embraced these crazy decisions that I've

1177
01:10:54,671 --> 01:10:57,610
made when I've left arts,
when I was at the tops of their field.

1178
01:10:57,630 --> 01:11:01,780
If those fields and because of some
strange calling ahead inside, I think, um,

1179
01:11:02,650 --> 01:11:05,010
no, I'm gonna have to do the top of
any of us like that. She's my hero.

1180
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:06,540
I'm the greatest person
if your normal life,

1181
01:11:07,750 --> 01:11:08,583
awesome

1182
01:11:12,570 --> 01:11:16,590
conversations. Uh, is there anything
you want to, any parting thoughts,

1183
01:11:17,010 --> 01:11:21,090
advice, suggestions, anything like
that, the, that you'd like to impart?

1184
01:11:21,570 --> 01:11:26,010
If not, we can, we can, we can call
it a day. But, uh, the mic is yours.

1185
01:11:26,011 --> 01:11:27,540
If you have anything you'd like to add.

1186
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:34,413
Well,

1187
01:11:37,970 --> 01:11:41,450
one thing that I've been doing
in the last years, um, after,

1188
01:11:41,451 --> 01:11:44,330
since writing the amount of learning
is I've been exposed to know the most

1189
01:11:44,331 --> 01:11:46,700
brilliant thinkers and these
different fields. Um, and I've,

1190
01:11:46,701 --> 01:11:50,840
I've studied the patterns behind them and
I've studied the people who study them.

1191
01:11:51,410 --> 01:11:56,410
And one of the things we have to
be wary of in life is studying the,

1192
01:11:57,320 --> 01:12:01,820
the people who study the artist as
opposed to the artists themselves. Um,

1193
01:12:02,210 --> 01:12:05,360
person who the other of them, they are the
most cycle maintenance. As I mentioned.

1194
01:12:05,630 --> 01:12:09,380
He uses this great term, the philosophers
and the full philosophy ologists right?

1195
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:12,440
That's a lot of colleges are the ones who
are basically philosophizing about the

1196
01:12:12,441 --> 01:12:14,000
philosophers as supposed
to do in philosophy.

1197
01:12:14,510 --> 01:12:17,420
And the vast majority philosophers today
actually are just philosophy ologists

1198
01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:19,090
similarly, these, you know,
you don't have to discuss,

1199
01:12:19,091 --> 01:12:20,630
there's the writers and
his literary critic.

1200
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:22,550
There's the artist and the art critic.

1201
01:12:23,150 --> 01:12:26,360
And I think that we have
to be very careful when we,

1202
01:12:26,390 --> 01:12:31,250
when we study excellence
and we're thinking about our
own path to excellence, um,

1203
01:12:31,340 --> 01:12:32,780
that we're studying the,

1204
01:12:33,050 --> 01:12:36,050
then we're tuning into the direct
experience of people who've actually been

1205
01:12:36,051 --> 01:12:38,270
there as opposed to the arms. You have
professors who were talking about it,

1206
01:12:38,470 --> 01:12:41,120
right? Because you know, it,

1207
01:12:41,150 --> 01:12:44,900
if we spend our life in the trenches
and we spend our life studying that last

1208
01:12:44,901 --> 01:12:47,070
like 0.1% of the learning process,
what we see is that,

1209
01:12:47,630 --> 01:12:52,490
that that final passage to excellence
is really about navigating that razor's

1210
01:12:52,491 --> 01:12:56,780
edge where you have to be willing to go
right up against a potential enormous

1211
01:12:56,781 --> 01:12:58,940
blender. And you have to
improvise, for example,

1212
01:12:59,150 --> 01:13:02,570
trust your intuition and moments
where all of the objective, um,

1213
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:05,690
mathematical faculties you've
developed a telling you something else,

1214
01:13:05,691 --> 01:13:08,250
but your intuition is operating
at a higher level. Um,

1215
01:13:08,330 --> 01:13:13,330
you have to really be willing to
go up to the brink of disaster,

1216
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:18,320
um, to, to succeed in moments
where you're, for example,

1217
01:13:18,321 --> 01:13:21,780
fighting in the finals of
a world championship or in
the very last second of the

1218
01:13:21,781 --> 01:13:25,970
Superbowl or an NBA finals. And,
and in navigating these things,

1219
01:13:26,660 --> 01:13:30,950
the arms, your professors will often
have the exact opposite of good advice,

1220
01:13:31,060 --> 01:13:35,990
right? And so, so what I would say
is, is for one thing, you know,

1221
01:13:37,070 --> 01:13:41,900
listen deeply internally to, to the core
of your being and build your game plan.

1222
01:13:41,901 --> 01:13:44,540
From there, it trust your gut.
And then build a lifestyle

1223
01:13:46,460 --> 01:13:48,710
around listening to that
and cultivate the love.

1224
01:13:48,740 --> 01:13:51,710
And that's the other thing I'd say is
that whether you're talking about at the

1225
01:13:51,711 --> 01:13:54,240
beginning of the learning process
or that were the very, you know,

1226
01:13:54,350 --> 01:13:57,920
the very final surge or surges,

1227
01:13:58,790 --> 01:14:01,220
it's about the love and we're thinking
about parenting and cultivating

1228
01:14:01,221 --> 01:14:03,020
resilience because of any
excellence called the van.

1229
01:14:03,021 --> 01:14:07,520
Creativity with the armature professors
all forget about is the love.

1230
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:09,460
Um,

1231
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:14,290
and that's what I see consistently with
people who have found the most pleasure,

1232
01:14:14,291 --> 01:14:16,090
the most happiness,
um,

1233
01:14:16,330 --> 01:14:20,590
and created the greatest start is that
they have a profound passion for what

1234
01:14:20,591 --> 01:14:22,480
they do. Not only the big
moments but the little moments,

1235
01:14:22,481 --> 01:14:26,080
but the moments that others would call
pain. They learned to love practice.

1236
01:14:26,110 --> 01:14:30,030
They learned to love the point
of resistance. Um, I said,

1237
01:14:30,031 --> 01:14:31,910
don't forget about the love.
I guess that's what I'd like to say.

1238
01:14:36,790 --> 01:14:40,000
I'm sure we will be talking next time.
We'll have some wine

1239
01:14:42,850 --> 01:14:46,600
and I hope everybody checks out.

1240
01:14:46,660 --> 01:14:51,660
Obviously the art of learning and really
keeps an eye on what you have come in

1241
01:14:51,790 --> 01:14:54,800
when you decide to push
stuff out of the cave.

1242
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:06,370
