1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,610
Quick sound test.
This is transition from t to Tequila.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,070
How do you feel about that decision?
I'm pretty excited and off we go

3
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:16,950
at this altitude I can run flat out
before my hands start shaking the oils.

4
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:17,880
You posted a question.

5
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:26,190
I'm a cybernetic organism
living this year.

6
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,230
Hello boys and girls.

7
00:00:35,231 --> 00:00:39,700
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another
episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

8
00:00:39,701 --> 00:00:44,320
I interview some of the world's top
performers, whether that be in investing,

9
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:49,060
sports, entrepreneurship or
otherwise film art, you name it,

10
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:54,480
to extract the tools and resources and
habits and routines that you can use and

11
00:00:54,491 --> 00:00:59,170
in this episode I have the pleasure in
beautiful San Francisco to interview an

12
00:00:59,171 --> 00:01:01,000
icon of tech,

13
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:05,020
but you do not have to be involved with
tech or even understand tech to get a

14
00:01:05,021 --> 00:01:09,250
lot out of this conversation.
Matt Mullenweg is one of my close friends.

15
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:14,490
He's been named one of PC world's top 50
people on the Web Inc coms 30 under 30

16
00:01:15,131 --> 00:01:18,730
and businessweek's 25 most
influential people on the web.

17
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,920
Why you might ask, has he received all of
these accolades? Well, he's a young guy,

18
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:27,160
but he is best known as a
founding developer of wordpress,

19
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:32,050
the open source software that powers
more than 22% of the entire web.

20
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:35,920
It's huge.
He's also the CEO of Automattic,

21
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:39,850
which is valued at more than $1 billion
and has a fully distributed team of

22
00:01:39,851 --> 00:01:43,060
hundreds of employees around the world.
However,

23
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,420
Matt started off as a
barbecue chomping Texas boy.

24
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:48,220
So how did this all come together?

25
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:52,930
It certainly was not the grand
vision from day one at all.

26
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:56,350
And Matt is an incredible human being,
is a gifted musician.

27
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,120
He is able to eat more than a hundred
chicken mcnuggets and in one sitting,

28
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:05,350
and we'll talk about why and how he
did that and we really dig into the

29
00:02:05,351 --> 00:02:09,250
specifics of how he hires,
what he looks for in people.

30
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:14,350
We get really, really nitty gritty
into his favorite books, his routines,

31
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:16,930
music habits,
work style.

32
00:02:16,931 --> 00:02:19,210
He's one of the most productive
people I've ever met in my life.

33
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:23,170
I think you're really gonna enjoy this
episode. Be prepared to take notes,

34
00:02:23,171 --> 00:02:26,470
but if you want all the links and
resources and everything else,

35
00:02:26,471 --> 00:02:29,380
of course you can find them.
As always in the show notes,

show notes. So without further
ado, please enjoy Matt Mullenweg.

39
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:49,000
Matt, sir, welcome to the show
had Hattie, Hattie, Hattie.

40
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,770
So let's explain the how to howdy
because there's some context missing.

41
00:02:53,771 --> 00:02:57,870
Of course we know each other.
Where does the howdy from? Uh,

42
00:02:57,871 --> 00:02:59,800
I was born and raised in Texas,

43
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:05,120
fine state. He was a fine, greatest
country in the world. And uh,

44
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:09,850
you've taught me a great many
things related to barbecue
related to photography,

45
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:10,661
so thank you for that.

46
00:03:10,661 --> 00:03:13,660
You got me very interested in photography
and we've traveled a lot together.

47
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:18,160
But for those people who don't know who
you are, when, uh, when someone asks you,

48
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,620
what do you do,
how do you answer that?

49
00:03:20,621 --> 00:03:25,621
These days I'm probably best known
for once eating 104 chicken nuggets.

50
00:03:25,751 --> 00:03:29,530
And one setting. Are you serious?
Yeah. Wow. I did not know.

51
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:34,020
How old are you need does that like
last week. Now you won't forget it. Um,

52
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,190
and then on the side I do,
uh,

53
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,190
we're going to open source
publishing platform called wordpress,

54
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:43,630
which power is such an amazing sites such
as the four hour, everything for Tim.

55
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:48,290
That's true. And others like New
York Times, Wall Street Journal, um,

56
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:53,140
about 23% of all websites now
are on wordpress. That's amazing.

57
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:58,210
And how did wordpress start for people
who don't know the origin story?

58
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:02,750
Sure. Uh, well it's an open source
project and it actually started, uh,

59
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:06,280
as a fork or a derivative of an
already existing open source project.

60
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:09,600
So it was this thing out there
called [inaudible], which um,

61
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:13,660
I was using and blogging with myself
and the, the crater disappeared.

62
00:04:13,661 --> 00:04:16,930
So the development stopped and myself
and this guy in England named Mike Little

63
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:21,730
picked it up and kept working on it.
How old were you at the time? 19. 19.

64
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:25,810
And were you self taught from, from
the standpoint of programming? Yeah,

65
00:04:25,811 --> 00:04:29,290
I tried to take some classes in school
and they were just all terrible.

66
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:33,880
So I would programming,
especially open source programming,

67
00:04:33,881 --> 00:04:37,780
like the web was the best place to learn
it. And what made the class is terrible.

68
00:04:37,781 --> 00:04:40,180
I'm just, I'm always curious
why, why did they fail?

69
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:43,300
Why did they not appeal to you? Well, I
didn't go to a great school to start with.

70
00:04:43,301 --> 00:04:46,630
I was at University of Houston.
I had amazing high school experience,

71
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,820
a high school for the
performing and visual arts.

72
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:52,030
One of the best experiences of my life.
But then I stayed in Houston.

73
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:56,410
You have h was all right. But uh,
the computer classes in particular,

74
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,330
I think like 20 or 30 years ago,

75
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:02,080
Microsoft basically
changed the curriculums are
influenced the curriculums of

76
00:05:02,081 --> 00:05:06,370
May these colleges. So even
though this was 2002, 2003 there,

77
00:05:06,371 --> 00:05:09,830
the web had already happened, you
know. Right. It was a thing. Yeah.

78
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:14,410
But they are still teaching you like
Microsoft visual basic and like you're

79
00:05:14,411 --> 00:05:18,820
building like buttons on
Windows Apps, sons, sons,

80
00:05:18,821 --> 00:05:21,770
really a white knuckle stuff as I did.

81
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,420
And so you see began working on this fork.

82
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:29,530
And could you explain what
open source means? Sure.

83
00:05:29,531 --> 00:05:30,670
For people who aren't familiar with it,

84
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:34,660
open source is for me the
most important idea of,

85
00:05:34,661 --> 00:05:37,030
and it's supposed to in my
lifetime, I actually, uh,

86
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:40,660
so think of open source like
a bill of rights for software.

87
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:44,920
And I think this is incredibly important
now that more and more of our lives are

88
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,540
influenced or governed by software.

89
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:52,020
It basically says that here's a four
freedoms that are inalienable rights you

90
00:05:53,021 --> 00:05:56,710
have when you use open source software
and the licenses that wordpress is under.

91
00:05:56,711 --> 00:06:00,260
The GPL says you have the freedom
to use the software for any purpose.

92
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,810
So that means you can make a,

93
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:08,170
Matt has funny hair blog if you want or
you can it or whatever you like and you

94
00:06:09,561 --> 00:06:11,360
can see how the software works,

95
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,980
you can modify the software and then you
can distribute those modifications to

96
00:06:15,981 --> 00:06:18,890
your friends.
And this sounds pretty basic and trivial,

97
00:06:18,891 --> 00:06:23,891
but a lot of what we use it would be the
equivalent of if you open the hood of

98
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:29,420
your car on there was just a black box
and you could be fined or go to jail for

99
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,080
trying to modify things, tampering with
it. Yeah. We're trying to understand it.

100
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,070
And let's, uh, so you,

101
00:06:37,071 --> 00:06:38,780
you're working on this fork.

102
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:43,760
At what point does it become
wordpress from the beginning actually.

103
00:06:43,761 --> 00:06:47,200
So with a capital w and a capital p for
everyone wondering that if you want to,

104
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,070
I don't see Mech at angry much,

105
00:06:49,071 --> 00:06:52,520
but if you want to really hit one of
his pet peeves, it's the lowercase B,

106
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,110
lowercase B.
Actually,

107
00:06:54,111 --> 00:06:58,400
it's not possible to write wordpress
with an uppercase w and a lower case B on

108
00:06:58,401 --> 00:07:03,130
wordpress as it should be, as you
should. It'll auto correct it.

109
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:08,120
I also feel badly for every transcendental
meditation teacher and I brought up,

110
00:07:08,121 --> 00:07:08,391
I was like,

111
00:07:08,391 --> 00:07:12,530
does it bother you when your TM always
turns into a trademark symbol in there?

112
00:07:12,531 --> 00:07:16,760
Like, oh my God, how did you know that
they need their own platform? Evidently.

113
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,260
Uh, so when did it become
wordpress? When was it,

114
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:25,580
when was it Chris and wordpress as the
name actually was one of the first things

115
00:07:25,581 --> 00:07:30,230
that came up with a friend in Houston
named Christine had the idea for the name

116
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:35,420
and um, she checked to the.org was
available and I registered at that day.

117
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:40,160
And that really brought it together
because [inaudible] slash cafe log,

118
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:44,390
if you have a slash her name, something
wrong in the beginning, but, um,

119
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:47,810
wordpress, I just liked it from the
moment I heard it. I was like, oh,

120
00:07:47,811 --> 00:07:50,660
this feels like something that
has a little bit of Gravitas,

121
00:07:50,661 --> 00:07:52,730
but still it's pretty accessible.

122
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:55,910
And the focus is in the early days,

123
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:59,240
which kind of distinguished us
from what we're at fort from.

124
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,200
I focused on web standards,
um, cleaning up the code,

125
00:08:03,201 --> 00:08:07,610
making sure that what we were out
putting was really tight and then

126
00:08:07,611 --> 00:08:11,660
installation. So it created
something called the famous
five minute installation.

127
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:15,440
Um, so the standards would be like, and I,

128
00:08:15,441 --> 00:08:17,150
I'm using maybe a sloppy metaphor,

129
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:21,800
but making sure that the
grammar and everything is
standards so that it can have

130
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:25,940
the widest adoption and tinkering
possible. It was more at the time,

131
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,140
the web platforms,

132
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:30,860
you would build a website for Netscape
and you build a website for Internet

133
00:08:30,861 --> 00:08:34,550
explorer and you'd use different
code for both our sites.

134
00:08:34,551 --> 00:08:36,210
We've worked with one and not the other.
I said,

135
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:39,110
so web standards who create a common
platform between them. Got It.

136
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:43,010
And the installation ended up being the
biggest thing we called it the famous

137
00:08:43,011 --> 00:08:45,470
five minute install,
even though it was neither famous,

138
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:49,610
it's famous to the two of you guys.
But it became a self fulfilling prophecy,

139
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,950
right? Because people said, oh it's,

140
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,980
it's famous and it's only five minutes
and competitive software at the time

141
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,330
would take 30 minutes an hour to set up.

142
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:02,340
And also that's how some
of our contemporaries like
movable type made their

143
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:04,770
money in the beginning cause you
could pay them to install it for you.

144
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,770
So the economic incentive was not
to make the installation easier.

145
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,730
So we just came in with that from the
beginning and it was really appealing to

146
00:09:11,731 --> 00:09:12,564
folks.

147
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:15,710
So you were right simplifying to get the,
well,

148
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,620
it's very interesting because
you were open source at the time.

149
00:09:18,621 --> 00:09:20,360
He did not have a profit motive.
Nope.

150
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,380
And therefore you are not incentive
on is to complicate the profit.

151
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:27,470
There were no golden handcuffs,
right, like likened to loose,

152
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:30,290
which is true for a lot of industries.

153
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:34,250
Professional Training for instance,
uh, is very much like that.

154
00:09:34,251 --> 00:09:38,270
There are very few trainers
are incentivized to make
themselves unnecessary,

155
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,550
right?
To make themselves obsolete.

156
00:09:40,551 --> 00:09:45,551
So they'll have a rotating schedule and
different types of mezzo cycles and so

157
00:09:45,561 --> 00:09:48,470
on that keep you tethered to
an ongoing program of training.

158
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:52,610
What's the Mezo Cycle? Well, you, you
can have different types of cycling.

159
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,480
For instance,

160
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:57,650
if you were leading up to a power
lifting competition or a wedding,

161
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:02,330
a trainer, it could very similar. Uh, you
always want to look like a power lifter,

162
00:10:02,331 --> 00:10:05,180
especially if you're a lady
for your wedding. Uh, you can,

163
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:08,000
you can cycle the type of training.
So you might have,

164
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:11,420
let's just say arbitrarily,
uh,

165
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:16,450
70% of your one rep Max and you work
between 70 and 75% of your one rep Max for

166
00:10:17,301 --> 00:10:20,270
four to eight week period, something like
that. And then you go into a new cycle,

167
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,720
which is, uh, I'm making this up again,

168
00:10:23,721 --> 00:10:28,460
but like 90% of your one rep
max are between 85 and 90. And,

169
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:32,240
uh,
so that would be that that has a place,

170
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:37,270
but I feel like just to bring it
back to two wordpress is that,

171
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,690
uh, I feel like the, the,

172
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:46,190
the number one priority of any good
physical training trainer or nutritionist

173
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:51,580
should be to enable their client with
the know how and tools that make them

174
00:10:53,871 --> 00:10:57,350
themselves obsolete. Uh, so
this complicate the profit is a,

175
00:10:57,351 --> 00:10:59,810
is is a real problem in a lot
of industries. What actually,

176
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:02,940
so my favorite classes in college where
the political science and philosophy

177
00:11:02,941 --> 00:11:07,941
ones and because you think about
systems instead of necessarily just and

178
00:11:09,631 --> 00:11:14,400
incentives versus, uh, what works
or what gets you to the next thing.

179
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,090
So, uh, again, kind of like what you said,

180
00:11:18,091 --> 00:11:21,450
a personal trainer is not going to be
incented to put themselves out of a job.

181
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,570
Um, can you create a system,
something you've done with,

182
00:11:24,571 --> 00:11:29,571
through your work where people can
self enable and from the early days of

183
00:11:29,671 --> 00:11:33,990
wordpress, we, we'd always think,
okay, well if we do x today,

184
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:39,030
what does that result in tomorrow,
a year from now, 10 years from now?

185
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:43,020
And it was kind of silly to think
about 10 years from now, but it's now

186
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:46,920
12 years old.
So I did that longterm vision

187
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:53,110
develop. What were the components that
helped you to develop that longterm view?

188
00:11:53,111 --> 00:11:54,910
Because you're a young guy.
I mean, you still aren't,

189
00:11:54,911 --> 00:11:57,580
despite the fact that you don't have
a three in front. How old are you now?

190
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,740
31 as of last week,

191
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,340
I was so tired of the under 30 awards that
you're getting every year. I was like,

192
00:12:03,341 --> 00:12:06,850
God, can this guy just turned 30 already?
I feel badly about myself every year.

193
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:10,990
It's award season. Huh?
Here we go again. But, uh,

194
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:16,090
what helped you to develop that,
that longterm view besides maybe these,

195
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,790
these political poly sign classes?

196
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:21,090
Yeah,

197
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:22,920
I think the, uh, political science really,

198
00:12:22,921 --> 00:12:27,921
really helps because any particular
aspect or figure I've really loved,

199
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:33,540
uh, to cities. It's actually
a classic. Um, he wrote, uh,

200
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:37,950
I think it was the Peloponnesia book
about the Peloponnesian War and he was one

201
00:12:37,951 --> 00:12:41,040
of the first what we
see now as historians.

202
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:43,860
So he would go back and writing
about this series of events.

203
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:49,340
We'll kind of look at the why and what
was the environment which created these

204
00:12:50,461 --> 00:12:52,980
things rather than saying Xyz happened,

205
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:58,260
saying this is what the world was like
and that caused Xyz had happened. Um,

206
00:12:58,650 --> 00:12:59,483
but the,

207
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:04,020
the metaphor I think of the most because
as simple as just like a dog chasing

208
00:13:04,021 --> 00:13:07,380
the car, right? Like what does the
dog do if he catches the car? Right.

209
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,880
It doesn't have a plan for it.
Yeah.

210
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:11,820
So I find it just as often
an entrepreneurial side,

211
00:13:11,821 --> 00:13:13,810
people don't play for success either.
Hmm.

212
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:16,680
Like if we create a
marketplace for plugins, right?

213
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,880
What is the natural conclusion of that?
If it's really, really successful, um,

214
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:24,720
well it's really, really successful.
There's not that many free plugins, right?

215
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:28,290
It looks more like an APP store on
Ios or android where everything's paid

216
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,740
because that's what the incentives will
be for the developers over the long term.

217
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:33,503
And

218
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:39,470
so let me ask you, this is a somewhat
oblique question or unrelated seemingly,

219
00:13:39,471 --> 00:13:42,920
but do you, are there any hedge fund
managers that you really get along with?

220
00:13:42,921 --> 00:13:47,840
You don't have to name them by name,
but you could sir. Our investors. Okay.

221
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:51,450
Who are some of your investors and we'll
talk about what they've invested in

222
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,210
tiger global.

223
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:56,920
So there's an amazing guy, Lee Fixel
over there. He works on the private side,

224
00:13:56,921 --> 00:14:00,310
not the public equity side, but it's
a hedge fund that end of the day, uh,

225
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,820
insights, true ventures. I
have. Some were actually,

226
00:14:03,821 --> 00:14:05,740
you've been blessed from the very
beginning with really great investors.

227
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:11,280
I know of a handful of hedge fund managers
very closely who were extremely good,

228
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,570
but a lot of them are macro.

229
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:16,920
They would describe themselves as
sort of macro guys, uh, which, uh,

230
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:18,990
I'll hope to go into another time.
But the point being,

231
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:23,940
they are very good at looking at sort
of primary effects, secondary effects,

232
00:14:23,941 --> 00:14:25,890
tertiary effects and trying to,

233
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:31,530
trying to predict the various butterflies
effect that can then inform a trade

234
00:14:31,531 --> 00:14:35,020
that other people aren't thinking of
or a position that other people are

235
00:14:35,021 --> 00:14:38,820
thinking of. A, I think you're
very good at that. Um, what,

236
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:39,800
okay.

237
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:43,670
If you had to call yourself a world
class at something besides eating chicken

238
00:14:43,671 --> 00:14:47,360
mcnuggets, what, what would
you, what would you say that is?

239
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,580
It might be related that because

240
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:56,470
the mcnuggets now thinking of systems,
um,

241
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,890
and sort of environments and ecosystems
and how things sort of cascade because

242
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:06,260
the, uh, you know, running an open
source project there. The, the,

243
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:10,910
the joke in term is BDFL so benevolent
dictator for life is technically my role

244
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:11,923
within wordpress,

245
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:16,470
but it's the most powerless
dictatorship ever because, uh,

246
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:20,200
oh, obviously you don't have an army,
you don't have the ability to tax. Uh,

247
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,400
but you don't really
have a carrot or a stick.

248
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:26,510
You're not paying people to do things
and you're not punishing them if they

249
00:15:26,511 --> 00:15:30,650
don't do things.
So you really earn a position where you,

250
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:32,450
the things you do have control over,

251
00:15:32,451 --> 00:15:36,680
like let's say the website or how
the code works or the license. Um,

252
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:38,300
you have to think of the
implications of that.

253
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,890
And then it's really just the power of
a bully pulpit, you know, once a years.

254
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:47,890
It's like the state of the Union
speech is happening from Obama. Uh,

255
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,870
once a year I give a state of
the word speech and try to,

256
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,640
that's at word cope at word camp.
Yeah.

257
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:57,290
I tried to think what are the things
that have been influencing me and the

258
00:15:57,291 --> 00:16:01,340
things that won't happen naturally in
the wordpress ecosystem that might need

259
00:16:01,341 --> 00:16:05,270
another push or might need to expose the
community is something that they're not

260
00:16:05,271 --> 00:16:07,590
thinking about. So a lot of
times at Word Camp San Francisco,

261
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:11,510
I'll bring in speakers like yourself or
other folks who aren't in the day to day

262
00:16:11,511 --> 00:16:14,750
wordpress, you know, hubbub, right.

263
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:18,190
Despite my best efforts to muck things up,

264
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,420
I was very happy, very,
very pleased that, uh,

265
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:28,200
our friend Nathan was so kind at the
barbecue world championships that sponsors

266
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,120
a,
do you still sponsor a team there?

267
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:33,960
I didn't last year as a first year.
I haven't been in a couple of years.

268
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:34,680
All right.

269
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,980
And Mason,
who's a tremendous developer,

270
00:16:37,981 --> 00:16:41,010
help to build a plugin called probation,

271
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:46,160
which allows me to white list someone
who leaves in a good comment that has

272
00:16:47,101 --> 00:16:51,660
aspects of, of questionable behavior,
whether it's too much cursing,

273
00:16:51,661 --> 00:16:55,090
maybe attacking someone else,
putting in too many links, um,

274
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:58,860
which is a hugely helpful
features. So thank you. Listen, uh,

275
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,990
and the, that customize that, that,

276
00:17:01,991 --> 00:17:05,550
that ability to customize has always
appealed to me about wordpress.

277
00:17:05,551 --> 00:17:08,910
What are other, uh, we can look
at it through a different Lens.

278
00:17:08,911 --> 00:17:13,911
What are some of the mistakes that would
be competitors to wordpress have made

279
00:17:13,921 --> 00:17:16,500
that prevented their wide,
wider spread adoption?

280
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:22,260
Hmm. Most of our, uh,

281
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:27,760
most contemporary competitors,
so the wix.com Squarespace,

282
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:32,840
etc. They focus more on it being a
service rather than it be something that's

283
00:17:33,311 --> 00:17:37,460
super extensible. So, for example,
that feature you just described, um,

284
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:41,790
we'll never be in court precedent. It will
never be what in core wordpress. It's,

285
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:42,340
um,

286
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:47,340
you know that it's a relatively small
audience isn't useful for the edge case.

287
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:48,130
Yeah.

288
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:52,440
And you know what to be like other people
who maybe have the same prominence as

289
00:17:52,441 --> 00:17:55,350
your blog, it would be useful for,
so there is an audience out there,

290
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,470
but it's not the tens of millions.
They use wordpress.

291
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:02,630
So if you're building a service like
wordpress.com or like Squarespace,

292
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,050
one of these others,
ah,

293
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,390
because you essentially have one
code base that everyone runs,

294
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:10,780
you have to sort of designed for the
majority or what you think the majority

295
00:18:10,781 --> 00:18:14,400
he's going to want or be a
where with wordpress with.

296
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,390
It's sort of infinite good
sensibility of themes and plugins. Uh,

297
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:21,800
there can be a million
Neesha's and in fact, uh,

298
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:26,190
with the way plugins are distributed for
people that run wordpress themselves,

299
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:29,010
almost no two are alike.
Right?

300
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:32,400
L when you think of the theme
plus the plugins at each blog,

301
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:36,210
each one's its own unique,
beautiful snowflake, right?

302
00:18:36,211 --> 00:18:39,810
So you're not trying to decide what the
average Susa shoe sizes in the world and

303
00:18:39,811 --> 00:18:43,530
give everyone a nine, uh, well,
so our competitors will say, ah,

304
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,950
it's this checklist of features and we're
going to do these 10 things wordpress

305
00:18:46,951 --> 00:18:49,860
does, and maybe we'll do this one better
than this one better. And honestly,

306
00:18:49,861 --> 00:18:54,170
like a smart team of a couple
of developers could probably
do that in a year. Um,

307
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,610
but to replicate the,
you know,

308
00:18:56,670 --> 00:19:01,560
35,000 plus plugins and themes is
sort of, it's a huge moat. I mean,

309
00:19:01,561 --> 00:19:02,400
it'd take lifetimes.

310
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,000
and@whatpointdidyoudecidetocreateautomaticwordpress.com?

311
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:14,340
Sure. So, uh, I should say what automatic
is. I'm a master company where I work,

312
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:18,300
um, and I became CEO last
year and basically it's,

313
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,030
they'd wait until he had a three in front
of your day and they had to wait until

314
00:19:21,031 --> 00:19:22,650
I was 30.
Um,

315
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:26,760
so it was basically taking the idea that
there are some services for wordpress

316
00:19:26,761 --> 00:19:31,200
that aren't appropriate for the open
source side is this distributed nonprofit

317
00:19:31,201 --> 00:19:32,880
thing.
And so,

318
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:36,360
and also that I wanted to create a
company that I wanted to work at.

319
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:41,310
And so that became automatic.
Um, what was the question? Uh,

320
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:45,840
how did you decide to create automatic?
Ah, you know, what it was, is it was spam.

321
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:50,250
Okay. Tell me more. So you know,

322
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:54,630
things on the web get spam. Oh yes. I'm
very well aware whether it's your email,

323
00:19:54,631 --> 00:19:56,760
a contact form, you know, spammers will,

324
00:19:56,761 --> 00:20:00,780
I think I have 100,000 more than a
hundred thousand spam comments in my wow.

325
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:04,110
Spinning. Righto. So what's been
protecting you as a plugin called Akismet?

326
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:06,810
Correct.
So kismet is anti-spam system.

327
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:11,760
And what had happened was I kept riding
anti-spam plugins that were just plugins.

328
00:20:11,761 --> 00:20:15,960
So there was just code that would run on
your blog and they would work for like

329
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:18,450
an ever decreasing amount of time.

330
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:21,510
So like the first one stopped spam for
like a year and the second one stopped it

331
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:22,380
for like six months.

332
00:20:22,381 --> 00:20:25,920
And then it got to the point where I'd
release a new version and like the next

333
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,390
day the spammers would work
around. I was like, these,

334
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:32,310
I always had like an idea of like a,
I apologize to anyone Russia name Ivan,

335
00:20:32,311 --> 00:20:36,440
but like I like this guy in Russia, I
like to download a plugin like, oh ha ha,

336
00:20:36,441 --> 00:20:40,290
I can work around this so easily.
And um, and so I thought, Huh,

337
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:42,450
like this is asymmetric warfare.

338
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,840
We're never going to beat the spammers
cause they are like the bully on the

339
00:20:45,841 --> 00:20:47,650
playground unless we team up.
Right.

340
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:51,550
And so Akismet is sort of a assist pack
of wolves that tear the bullies apart.

341
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:53,830
Yeah, it's a pack of wow, I like that.

342
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:59,170
Or maybe it's like circling the wagons,
you know, it kind of protects you for,

343
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:04,070
it's more like visually less violent
and it's able to adapt as quickly as a

344
00:21:04,071 --> 00:21:07,630
spammer spammers where, um,
because it's a centralized service.

345
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:12,900
I built some centralized services before
that were expensive to run and costing

346
00:21:14,501 --> 00:21:15,610
me a lot out of my own pocket.

347
00:21:15,611 --> 00:21:18,370
So I wanted to make it a business
so it can be self sustainable.

348
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:21,850
I didn't want this something sort of
running on my charity or if I went away

349
00:21:21,851 --> 00:21:22,570
this would stop.

350
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:27,340
So that's why we also need money
for food and I don't need that much.

351
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:32,650
We'll talk more about that
later. Got It. Not to interrupt.

352
00:21:32,651 --> 00:21:37,651
So akismet spam and that was the first
part of auto of automatic and it made

353
00:21:37,661 --> 00:21:41,080
perfect sense because it was something
that wordpress, the software couldn't do.

354
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,610
It was something that was a service.

355
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,230
It was something that I wanted to have
a sustainable business model and I'm,

356
00:21:47,231 --> 00:21:50,620
so that was actually the first
thing. I kind of the, I left seen it.

357
00:21:50,621 --> 00:21:53,620
So I moved out to San Francisco, I
got a job at CNN. It was awesome.

358
00:21:53,621 --> 00:21:56,440
I was there for about a year and
basically the weekend after I left I just

359
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:00,070
hacked like the whole time and
released the first version of a Kismet.

360
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,100
What year was that roughly?

361
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:08,650
I believe it was 2005 2005 and was
that the period in which you were

362
00:22:08,681 --> 00:22:13,150
experimenting with Polyphasic Sleep?
Or was it before or after that question?

363
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:17,200
Um, no, I did the polyphasic
sleep before then. Okay.

364
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:19,780
So that was a,
that was when I was still in Houston.

365
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,620
And for those people who don't know Polly
physics leaves is very controversial

366
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:27,490
concept of taking what
would normally require,

367
00:22:27,491 --> 00:22:32,290
say eight hours sleeping Mano phasic
meaning one block in breaking it up into

368
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:35,800
multiple fragments. I wrote about
this in the four hour body and men,

369
00:22:35,801 --> 00:22:39,700
do people get excited about that?
You did positively or negatively. Uh,

370
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:44,230
so what was it you were experimenting
with? Was it Uber Man? Uh Huh.

371
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,080
So it's about, what is it between
two and two and a half hours,

372
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:50,540
something like that in a 24 hour
cycle in a 24 hour cycle. So it,

373
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,810
the four hours on and then
2030 minutes of sleep.

374
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:56,170
What happens if you miss one
of those neps your wrecked.

375
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,560
But this was probably one of the
most productive periods of my life.

376
00:22:59,561 --> 00:23:03,250
So I wrote wordpress and that time
and also something called BB press.

377
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:08,230
And I remember, I remember your
answer, but I'm curious if, uh,

378
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,860
if you remember what you told me, why
you stop polyphasic sleep, what happened?

379
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:15,190
What did I tell you? Um,
you got a girlfriend.

380
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:19,710
It turns out, I know girlfriends
don't like that sleep cycle.

381
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:23,330
No one would have predicted that the
getting into the girlfriend and maybe the

382
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:26,640
beginning of the girlfriend.
Um, and maybe that's that.

383
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:29,840
Maybe that's why Mary someday, you know,
someone who also be on polyphasic sleep,

384
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:33,910
but the seems like you're
really tense household.

385
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:39,220
She has to type, double rack and do
polyphasic sleep. What? All right,

386
00:23:39,221 --> 00:23:43,210
you brought it up. Why are you
obsessed with divorce check? Oh yeah.

387
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:46,460
So Devorah is an alternative keyboard.
So instead of that,

388
00:23:46,461 --> 00:23:49,280
I was going ASD F it's
a oh EU for example.

389
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:53,250
And all the letters it's f for a and m
actually are in different places. So it's,

390
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:58,310
it would be a competitor to Qwerty.
Yes. Right. And it's more efficient.

391
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:01,130
So I think I was 14 or
15, I thought, well,

392
00:24:01,131 --> 00:24:03,020
I'm going to probably be
typing the rest of my life.

393
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:07,460
And so if there's a more
efficient way to do it, um,

394
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:11,000
I should learn that.
And it took about a month.

395
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:13,500
It's Kinda like learning a
new instrument actually. Uh,

396
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,560
and I just kind of went cold Turkey

397
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,330
and learn a type of work and I've been
doing it. Yeah, we're 15 years now. Gosh,

398
00:24:20,331 --> 00:24:24,650
I'm old. And do you still offer rewards
to employees who pick up the work?

399
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:28,670
It's more like public shaming
and or highlighting. Um,

400
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:33,320
we do a little hints like it's a, it's
a dictator with a little more teeth. Uh,

401
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:35,600
we'll, we'll, uh, you know,

402
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:38,840
in our Christmas pack we sent out like
a Devorah keyboard cover for your laptop

403
00:24:38,841 --> 00:24:40,520
or little a DV Xen,

404
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:44,330
which is a DV z.org is actually a great
website that tells you all the benefits

405
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:48,380
of work even better than I have.
So there's things like in a,

406
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:51,200
I'm making up the numbers,
but in a year of typing and query,

407
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:54,890
your fingers move like 18 miles and a
divorce, they move like two miles. Wow.

408
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,980
I guess almost an order of
magnitude more official.

409
00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:00,980
I never thought of it this way, but
there's the speed benefit, which uh,

410
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,250
I'm very impressed.
I was very impatient with the divorce.

411
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:07,670
I did play with it for awhile and then I
had to switch laptops with people and I

412
00:25:07,671 --> 00:25:11,360
wasn't tech savvy enough to to figure
it out or not. It was in Europe I think.

413
00:25:11,361 --> 00:25:13,160
And I was just like having trouble
with the settings and they got very

414
00:25:13,161 --> 00:25:15,500
frustrated.
But uh,

415
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:20,870
would you say there's an argument for
Devorah tech being easier on your tendons

416
00:25:20,871 --> 00:25:24,710
and carpal tunnel and all that? I'd say
that's the most, um, the biggest benefit.

417
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:29,840
So I, you know, again, a type for a
living and I've never had any problem.

418
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:34,160
What type of keyboard do you use? Uh, I
just use the keyboard of my laptop mostly.

419
00:25:34,161 --> 00:25:35,540
Now do I?
Yeah.

420
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,770
They used to have this funky ergonomic
keyboard that kept your hands,

421
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:42,050
your palms, more verticals
that right? Yeah.

422
00:25:42,051 --> 00:25:44,600
You emailed me about that the
other day. What was it called? Oh,

423
00:25:44,601 --> 00:25:48,290
I have no idea what I'm asking.
I looked it up and I told you what it was.

424
00:25:48,291 --> 00:25:52,080
But yeah, it was where the
keys were actually sort of
slanted in. Right. And um,

425
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,650
so it's almost like
you're holding joysticks.

426
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:56,990
I mean in that hand position with your,
with your fingers extended and it is,

427
00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:01,100
you know what, that keyboard
is very comfortable and I
like it, but honestly the,

428
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:05,990
just the, I'm not really limited
when I'm on my computer by the speed,

429
00:26:05,991 --> 00:26:08,810
I can type meaning unless I
was transcribing something.

430
00:26:08,811 --> 00:26:09,710
Like right when you're talking,

431
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:14,390
I'm limited by the space of extra dollars
transcribing and or have it every now

432
00:26:14,391 --> 00:26:18,080
and then, um, you know, I'm really
limited by speed I can think, right.

433
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:22,430
Which is much slower than 120 words per
minute or whatever I can type and um,

434
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,400
so really the comfort
is what does it for me.

435
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:29,030
It's also kind of a cool security
mechanism when someone sits down at your

436
00:26:29,031 --> 00:26:30,840
laptop and like they can't do
anything quickly, anything,

437
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:34,520
but it is Devorah is built into
every single modern day computer,

438
00:26:34,521 --> 00:26:37,310
windows and Mac.
So you can just as a setting,

439
00:26:37,311 --> 00:26:40,350
if you go to into international
keyboards and you can do it. Um,

440
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:43,860
and I'd highly recommend, you know, you
have a pretty hardcore of listeners,

441
00:26:43,861 --> 00:26:48,670
so pretty hard core habit of writing too.
Um, yeah, I would check out the work,

442
00:26:48,671 --> 00:26:51,880
but there's also a slightly more efficient
one called coal Mac that if I were

443
00:26:51,881 --> 00:26:56,340
starting today, I might do call Mac. How
do you spell Comac? C. O. L. E m. A. K.

444
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:59,910
Um, now the difference between
Courtney and Devorah is like,

445
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,350
let's call that 50% in between like
Devorah can call Mac is like two or 3%.

446
00:27:04,351 --> 00:27:08,250
So got it. I haven't switched again,
just because it's only marginal. But, um,

447
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,640
if you're coming from Courtney, yeah.
Pick one of them. Huge. Cool. All right.

448
00:27:11,641 --> 00:27:15,690
We will link to all that in
the show notes. Uh, automatic.

449
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:16,903
Hmm.

450
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:22,840
Is it coincidence that automatic is
spelled with an m a t t in the middle?

451
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,750
That was a typical egotistical founder.

452
00:27:25,751 --> 00:27:30,340
I tried to work my name and
everything and uh, should do that.

453
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,800
I should, I could, I could, Tim is short.

454
00:27:32,801 --> 00:27:35,680
I could stick it in the
middle of a lot of stuff. Uh,

455
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,950
automatic itself is,

456
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:43,180
it's a unique company in a lot of ways.
How,

457
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:47,320
how has automatic different from
the average tech startup out there

458
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:53,310
had a lot of ways. So the first and
foremost is that everything we put out,

459
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:57,000
we're open source to the core.
So most technology companies,

460
00:27:57,001 --> 00:28:00,030
the Ip of our software is one
of the chief values of it,

461
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:02,610
and we open source from
released to the public.

462
00:28:02,611 --> 00:28:07,260
The vast majority of the Ip we create.
So that's the first and foremost,

463
00:28:07,261 --> 00:28:11,100
and it's really the key to the
philosophy of automatic. And the second,

464
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:14,820
which is I think the future of work
and the future of all companies,

465
00:28:14,821 --> 00:28:16,020
is that we're totally distributed.

466
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:21,710
So we're now over 300 people and 37
countries and well over 200 cities.

467
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:25,650
So most people work from home or in
coworking spaces, wherever they are.

468
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,450
We have a headquarters
here in San Francisco,

469
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,220
but it's only got about
20 ish people in it.

470
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:33,960
And every time I've been to the
headquarters, look, where's everybody?

471
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:36,860
Oh wait there teach tee shirts.
I can get that deck.

472
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:37,703
They're going to be a teacher.

473
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:40,110
But we just needed a place
to get mail and subpoenas.

474
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,590
Do you get a lot of subpoenas? Ah, yeah.
It's like everyone who publishes them,

475
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:49,410
it's like if Bill Gates, Scott takedown
notices for people using Microsoft word,

476
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,290
like we just get everybody
contacting us for everything.

477
00:28:52,291 --> 00:28:56,370
Every type of a disagreeable content
that's published on wordpress results in

478
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:59,370
some type of letter. Yup.
That sounds like fun. Well,

479
00:28:59,371 --> 00:29:02,650
the more clueless the attorney, the more
likely they're all the contact us. Right,

480
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:07,260
right. And, uh, focusing on
the distributed aspect, uh,

481
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,880
how did you make that decision
and how early on, I mean, what,

482
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:11,940
what was the process like?

483
00:29:11,941 --> 00:29:15,000
Tell me the story of how you made that
decision is literally from day one and

484
00:29:15,001 --> 00:29:17,670
it's, it was influenced by
the fact that, you know,

485
00:29:17,671 --> 00:29:20,790
wordpress is an open source project
before I created the company automatic.

486
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:26,230
So the first four or five
people at Automattic, we're
all in different cities. Um,

487
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:29,820
you know, we had Vermont's Texas,
I was in San Francisco actually.

488
00:29:29,821 --> 00:29:34,460
The very first guy was in Blarney Ireland,
Cork County, which is like the Texas.

489
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:37,920
I were the blarney stone. Is it as it
over the blind? This is the blarney stone.

490
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:42,040
So you, uh, you climb to the top
of this castle thing and you kind

491
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,370
of hang off the side and Eric kind of
upside down and you kiss this stone.

492
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,300
She's as old guy was trying to hold you

493
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,900
and it's probably not
sanitary, but yeah. Um,

494
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:55,000
I was very shy before I
kissed it about 10 years ago.

495
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:59,680
And now you're down talking
to you. Okay, well hold on.

496
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:04,690
I want to talk about nervousness and
boldness and shyness for a second.

497
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:09,370
We are going to come back
to the distributed nature
of automatic. This is not,

498
00:30:09,371 --> 00:30:12,280
in fact the first time that I've
interviewed you. Do you remember,

499
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,260
do you remember the very first,

500
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,680
maybe you can tell people about the very
first phone call that I made to you?

501
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,073
Was that an interview?

502
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:24,660
No, I was saying I was, I was calling
you to ask if I could interview. Yes.

503
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:28,380
So Tim, this was pre for our
work week, right? Yeah, it was,

504
00:30:28,381 --> 00:30:31,260
I think it was 2006 so it
was an old school or early,

505
00:30:31,261 --> 00:30:34,530
early 2007 my Tim Bona Fides out
of like, oh yeah, back in the day.

506
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:38,940
Um, and I got the I, my phone never
rings and I almost never answered,

507
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:43,960
but for some reason I answered this and
I'm this weird guy who talked very fast,

508
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:45,710
did

509
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:48,980
monologue for like 10 minutes. I don't
know, it was actually 10 minutes.

510
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:54,500
It was really bad. But this was
a Timbo Tim Ferriss and he was

511
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:57,860
telling me about something,
I don't know,

512
00:30:57,861 --> 00:30:59,940
I think it was like verbal shock and awe.
It was,

513
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:05,630
I was trying to establish my
credentials and a mutual friend,

514
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:10,760
Mj Kim had had made the intro and I was
worried you would hang up because I was

515
00:31:10,761 --> 00:31:14,570
aware, I was aware of vaguely that you
did not, you weren't really a phone guy,

516
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:19,160
so you're trying to get an all the words
before I hung up. That's right. Which,

517
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:23,480
which is not the best policy in the world.
But we did end up,

518
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:27,440
it worked getting know each other and
I wanted that story to be told because

519
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:32,770
it's easy for listeners or
readers to assume that, you know,

520
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:36,650
my pitches have always been great
and then I was born that way. No,

521
00:31:36,651 --> 00:31:39,440
I've had thousands of horrible pitches.

522
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:44,090
Some of them just by the luck of the
day you happen to contact someone work.

523
00:31:44,091 --> 00:31:47,120
But it's despite your, despite your
technique, not because of it. So

524
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,710
distributed from day one,

525
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:55,140
what are the tools that you
currently use to make that work?

526
00:31:56,790 --> 00:32:01,740
So open source projects mostly work like
this and basically what they do is they

527
00:32:01,741 --> 00:32:03,480
say you use things like,

528
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:06,120
well back in the day I'm going to say
some old technologies and then we'll get

529
00:32:06,121 --> 00:32:07,770
some new technologies,
IRC,

530
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:12,810
which is sort of a old text
chat or I am system. Um,

531
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,060
you collaborate using
distributed source control.

532
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:18,300
So we use subversion is the modern day
equivalent would be something like get

533
00:32:18,301 --> 00:32:22,680
hub. So you basically have ways that
you can, we get email mailing lists, um,

534
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:24,890
forms, all the things that, you know,

535
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:28,020
people do even when they're in the
same office. [inaudible] they, they,

536
00:32:28,021 --> 00:32:32,240
I am each other. You just make that the
primary way you communicate and that,

537
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:35,190
so that's what we did from the very
beginning. I mean, what our Max started,

538
00:32:35,191 --> 00:32:38,160
we literally, it was
bootstrapped beginning, had
no money. And I thought, well,

539
00:32:38,161 --> 00:32:39,650
why would I was in San Francisco?

540
00:32:39,651 --> 00:32:44,180
But why would I move all these people
to the most expensive place in America,

541
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:49,940
right? When we also have no money?
And I'm most investors. Fact,

542
00:32:49,941 --> 00:32:51,650
a lot of them said, oh
yeah, when you raise money,

543
00:32:51,651 --> 00:32:55,580
you can finally move everyone there.
But you know, Donica and Ireland's was,

544
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:58,100
became ready to start a family.
And you know,

545
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:01,510
people are different places for
different reasons and it's true.

546
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:05,720
The Bay area has some amazing talent,
but you also have, well two, two things.

547
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:09,800
You have some incredibly talented people
all over the world who for whatever

548
00:33:09,801 --> 00:33:13,420
reason don't want to live here, even
though it's a pretty cool place. Yeah. Um,

549
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,610
you also have, you know,
some of the largest,

550
00:33:16,611 --> 00:33:20,480
most successful companies in the world
market caps of over a trillion dollars

551
00:33:20,481 --> 00:33:25,310
combined competing for the same 20 or
30,000 engineers in one place in one

552
00:33:25,311 --> 00:33:29,780
place, right? So when you add
up Cisco, oracle, apple, Google,

553
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,220
just go down to the dimensional, the
startups, linkedin, Facebook, Twitter.

554
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:37,490
Plus all startups. Um, they're, uh,

555
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:42,210
they're all fishing in this pond, which
is a little bit over fished. Yeah. Um,

556
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,170
again, not to say there's not
great people, it's just that, uh,

557
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:49,610
perhaps back in the day when you had
to go to like one of these universities

558
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:54,611
like Stanford or MIT to learn the things
to create a scalable webscale startup

559
00:33:56,871 --> 00:33:59,480
or service. Um, it was
important to be clustered there,

560
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:02,450
but now you can learn all this stuff
on hacker news and you can read,

561
00:34:02,451 --> 00:34:03,780
read it and you can,
you know,

562
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:08,120
learn everything you need to do to build
the next wordpress from anywhere in the

563
00:34:08,121 --> 00:34:09,500
world and in place.
You have an internet connection.

564
00:34:09,501 --> 00:34:14,450
So there's some super smart people all
over. And so we just started to say,

565
00:34:14,451 --> 00:34:18,350
well, just like it's silly to discriminate
on the basis of the, just say gender.

566
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,660
I've said,
we're not going to hire a man or a woman.

567
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:23,950
It's dumb because you're just cut
out half of the possible hiring pool.

568
00:34:23,951 --> 00:34:28,190
So by definition, people who hire would
be not as good as if you looked at 100%.

569
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:29,691
We said,
well,

570
00:34:29,691 --> 00:34:34,691
we're going to look at the 99.9% of
the world that doesn't live in the San

571
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:36,343
Francisco Bay area.

572
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:40,700
So not only are you getting better
talent because you have a larger pool to

573
00:34:40,701 --> 00:34:41,534
filter from.

574
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:45,290
What can you do with the cost savings
of not having to build out a huge

575
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:46,640
infrastructure for a campus?

576
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:51,170
I don't know if there's actually a cost
savings because once you start flying

577
00:34:51,171 --> 00:34:54,970
people around and things like that,
like it does add up and we give people a,

578
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,700
an allowance for example,
a $250 per month coworking allowance,

579
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:03,050
they can use it at Starbucks or cafes,
they can use it at a coworking space. We,

580
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:06,980
so we, we invest in people's a space
because we want them to be productive.

581
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:12,760
But I think what it really comes down
to is just allowing people freedom,

582
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:16,610
autonomy and something that was actually
inspired when I finally read your book

583
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:18,830
is some lifestyle arbitrage.
Yeah.

584
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:23,990
I mean you can make us San Francisco
salary and live in Argentina or Alabama or

585
00:35:23,991 --> 00:35:26,240
wherever you want to. Cause
a lot goes, it goes very,

586
00:35:26,241 --> 00:35:29,990
very far and that's kind of
cool. And um, or like myself,

587
00:35:29,991 --> 00:35:33,770
like I travel most of the
time. Where is the, uh,

588
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:36,680
your 37 countries,

589
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,720
what are the most heavily weighted
countries were represented?

590
00:35:42,721 --> 00:35:47,040
Countries. Oh, an order. It's probably
it's English speaking countries in order.

591
00:35:47,041 --> 00:35:51,870
So it's a United States is about two
thirds. So again, more than majority. Ah,

592
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:56,400
we love us some Canadians.
I love Canadian. Um,

593
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:01,470
UK, Australia. Those are kind of
the top four or five. Yup. Ireland.

594
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:05,130
So because we're still,
although we're totally distributed,

595
00:36:05,131 --> 00:36:09,040
we're still speak English,
right? So places where, uh,

596
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:14,360
so that's like the top five and
then have the other 32 countries.

597
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:17,310
Um, many of them, we just have
one person in them, right.

598
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,840
We only have one person in India.

599
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:22,890
We have I think three or four people
in Argentina, one person in Brazil.

600
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:27,870
So it just kind of ends up being
whoever the coolest, most. Uh,

601
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,393
I was going to say

602
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:31,580
bad,
but I don't wait

603
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:36,760
for a few who don't know. Matt. He
never curses. He has a lot of trouble.

604
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:40,270
It'd be like forcing Mr.
Rogers to say fuck on the air.

605
00:36:40,271 --> 00:36:44,980
It would just be the most excrutiatingly
painful thing to watch. So yes,

606
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,630
there are bad, bad button
bad, but engineers, Tim, now
I can't send this to my mom.

607
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:52,540
We can, we can bleep the f.
It's all right. You know,

608
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:55,120
I actually don't have a problem with
cursing. I just don't do it myself.

609
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:59,110
And how long has that been? Has
that always been the case? No,

610
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:03,250
I don't mean you're from Texas.
And again,

611
00:37:03,251 --> 00:37:05,590
I don't let them in and get
all the tech ops curse a lot,

612
00:37:05,591 --> 00:37:07,450
but I'm from Long Island.
It's like you can't avoid it.

613
00:37:07,451 --> 00:37:08,410
That's half of what we say.

614
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:11,550
This is actually a myth in the company
that you can't curse around me or I'll

615
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:15,760
get mad. But it's just not true at all.
Um, I have no personal problem with it.

616
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:19,330
I feel like I would've picked up on that.
How long have you not been cursing?

617
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,640
I feel like I must have read
a book when I was younger,

618
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:26,640
like a James Bond type book or something.
And I, cause I recall the sentence,

619
00:37:26,641 --> 00:37:28,710
I just don't remember the
context and if someone's like,

620
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:32,010
you know the English language has more
words in it than any other language in

621
00:37:32,011 --> 00:37:32,844
the world.

622
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:36,690
And so you can find your way to express
yourself and some of these other

623
00:37:36,691 --> 00:37:38,010
hundreds of thousands of words

624
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:42,760
now obviously words like f word are so
versatile you can use them in a million

625
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:45,970
different ways. But the, there's
a lot of other really good ones.

626
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:49,240
So I tried to have all
expressed myself in another way.

627
00:37:49,241 --> 00:37:54,241
It's always struck me and I feel like
such a course unrefined sort of knuckle

628
00:37:54,491 --> 00:37:58,630
dragger with the amount that I curse,
which is I, I enjoy being around you.

629
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:01,780
And a the is something we've talked about
on the podcast before with other folks

630
00:38:01,781 --> 00:38:05,080
is surrounding yourself with people
you want to be the average of.

631
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:08,800
And so I like one of the reasons I
enjoy being around you is that you,

632
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:12,910
you forced me to become very
aware of how much I curse,

633
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:18,970
which oftentimes I think it is reflective
of lazy thinking just in the way that

634
00:38:18,971 --> 00:38:22,900
if you overuse the word interesting, like
Oh, interesting. That is a garbage word.

635
00:38:22,901 --> 00:38:26,890
It means nothing like come up
with a better word or, uh, my,

636
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:31,000
my particular crutch was
pretty, oh, that's pretty
good. That's pretty expensive.

637
00:38:31,001 --> 00:38:33,190
I was pretty awesome.
And I got so annoyed with it.

638
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:36,100
The way that I tried to fix it,
which very

639
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:40,930
well actually for a period of time was
requiring that every time I say pretty,

640
00:38:40,931 --> 00:38:45,280
I add fucking after it no matter who I
was with that guy that's pretty fucking

641
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:49,180
expensive on it's pretty fucking pretty
or whatever, which, which solved it. But,

642
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:53,920
um, the, what are the
current tools that you use?

643
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,220
So you had IRC and so on,
but what, what do you,

644
00:38:57,221 --> 00:38:59,710
what's the state of the art
within automatic for managing,

645
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:02,770
keeping that machine running
with the distributed teams.

646
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,830
So we actually ended up
creating a tool called P two.

647
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,200
So you can get it at [inaudible] dot com

648
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:13,600
and that is a basically
a replacement for email.

649
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:16,060
So automatic basically sends no emails.

650
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:19,390
I get all the emails I get is
from people outside the company.

651
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:21,320
And think of pizza too.

652
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:25,090
Almost like a social cast or a Yammer
or can like an internal Twitter or

653
00:39:25,091 --> 00:39:28,510
Facebook, but really work oriented
where people can post short things,

654
00:39:28,511 --> 00:39:33,070
long things, blog posts and bed,
youtube, rich media, mockups, images,

655
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:36,520
audio, anything. And it's a
threaded asynchronous discussion.

656
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:38,830
But because it's not email,

657
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:41,590
I honestly don't know why people
use email so much in companies.

658
00:39:41,591 --> 00:39:43,390
Because imagine that you're a company,

659
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:46,000
you're a team of 10 people
and you joined that team.

660
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:48,730
How do you catch up with a past
two years of conversations?

661
00:39:48,731 --> 00:39:51,430
Do you get people to forward you like
all the emails they've been doing,

662
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:54,430
if someone leaves,
like does everything in their inbox,

663
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:56,260
what does everything in
their inbox disappears?

664
00:39:56,261 --> 00:39:58,390
And all that sort of locked
in knowledge has gone.

665
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:02,590
So everything in automatics public by
default, all of our stats, all of our,

666
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:06,920
everything, everything, everything
like Saturdays, equity. Uh,

667
00:40:06,921 --> 00:40:11,890
so we're not buffer where we publish, you
know, salaries and equity, but the, um,

668
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:16,610
so just for context for people who are
not in this world of tech buffer apps,

669
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:19,840
actually a, an app I use every day
are very useful for scheduling,

670
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:24,640
but a buffer app allows you to schedule
a different types of Facebook posts,

671
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:27,780
Twitter posts, etc. Uh, among many,
many other things. But they're,

672
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:32,110
they're extremely transparent,
uh, in, in with their information.

673
00:40:32,111 --> 00:40:35,410
So they publish a formula essentially.
Yeah. That how they determine their,

674
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:36,850
it's like a base salary,

675
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:41,250
like salary is 50 k for support plus
a multiplier for experience plus a,

676
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,890
you can get equity or more salary or
things like that. So theory, the formulas,

677
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:49,440
public, um, I think some of that stuff
goes a little bit too far and it,

678
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,550
it had reads as many
problems as it solved.

679
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:55,120
How do you draw the line or how do
you decide where to draw the line?

680
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,700
It's really a judgment call.

681
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,760
And also thinking about what is
the logical conclusion of this.

682
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:06,700
So how does that system work?
One,

683
00:41:06,701 --> 00:41:10,390
we're 10,000 employees
or 100,000 employees. Uh,

684
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:13,630
and does it just sort of
kick the can down the road?

685
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:16,840
So the thing I think about
the buffer system isn't,

686
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:20,110
it's not bad that their salaries are
public. In fact, government jobs,

687
00:41:20,111 --> 00:41:24,910
salaries are public and many companies
have sort of stated titles and levels

688
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:27,850
that have certain ranges,
but then it just kind of,

689
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:30,010
it kind of kicks the can down the road.

690
00:41:30,011 --> 00:41:34,880
That why is this guy again in spirits
multiplier of 1.3 and mine 1.1 you still

691
00:41:34,881 --> 00:41:38,720
have the kicking the can
down the road, man. Uh, it's,

692
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:44,110
if it purports to solve the idea
of compensation to inequity,

693
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,790
right? Um, there's still

694
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:52,880
a subjective measures that have a big
impact on what the formula at the output

695
00:41:52,881 --> 00:41:55,750
of the formula. That
doesn't really help. Um,

696
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,020
so is it what I think of is,

697
00:41:59,021 --> 00:42:03,170
is this going to make the company either
solve a problem that we can't solve

698
00:42:03,171 --> 00:42:07,250
otherwise or is it going to make
it better overall? And so, uh,

699
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:12,050
so all of our communication being
public does, and it's all searchable.

700
00:42:12,051 --> 00:42:14,140
It's all indexed. It's all tagged. Um,

701
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:17,880
I could look you up in our system and
see every meeting anyone's ever had. Wow.

702
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:22,070
This guy really doesn't know how to use
computers. Yeah. The going back now,

703
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:24,710
you know, almost 10 years,
we turned 10 this year.

704
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:28,340
So that's pretty powerful to have that
sort of record of everything and it's all

705
00:42:28,341 --> 00:42:32,000
searchable and indexed.
So that I think makes sense.

706
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:36,980
And we're very trusting internally.
Like if we're working on an acquisition,

707
00:42:36,981 --> 00:42:40,070
for example, in my status
updates, I do weekly,

708
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:43,340
I'll put that I worked on this
acquisition in theory that could leak,

709
00:42:43,341 --> 00:42:45,440
it could whatever.
But I find that when you trust people,

710
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:49,310
they tend to do the right thing versus
if we try to like really lock everything

711
00:42:49,311 --> 00:42:53,510
down, I feel like that would
engender a two way loyalty. Uh,

712
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:57,200
so p two a slack I really
loved. Can, you know,

713
00:42:57,201 --> 00:43:02,160
slack has come up a lot recently for
me, including for very small teams. Uh,

714
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:06,740
can you explain slack it? Sure. As
I pour water all over this table.

715
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:10,600
That's all right. That's right. It's,
it's, it's would supposedly, you know,

716
00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:14,170
I would assume the tree is exposed
to water. That's going to be okay.

717
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:19,250
So at some point, so slack is kind of,
for us, it's a replacement for IRC.

718
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,740
So imagine a,

719
00:43:21,741 --> 00:43:25,340
it's a real time chat platform
that actually has a lot
of the benefits of p two.

720
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:29,570
You can embed media in it and things,
but it just makes sense for, for I am,

721
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:33,590
so we used Skype before,
but again it didn't really scale for us.

722
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:38,540
So if you're the hundred and fourth 101st
person to join Automattic and we use

723
00:43:38,541 --> 00:43:40,460
Skype for all of our messaging each other,

724
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:44,120
you have to add a hundred people to your
contact list and be accepted by each

725
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:45,210
one of them.
Um,

726
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:48,200
rooms have limits for how many people
they can have and just all these arbitrary

727
00:43:48,201 --> 00:43:52,290
things. It's not suited. And slack,
you can DM anyone in the company. Uh,

728
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:55,690
everything's, they also have a really
great search. There is public channels.

729
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:58,070
Anyone can join this
private groups and it just,

730
00:43:58,071 --> 00:43:59,840
it's done by some of the
folks behind flicker,

731
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:03,500
Stuart Butterfield calendars
and it's just really well done.

732
00:44:03,501 --> 00:44:06,230
Like it's pleasant to use.
Loved the name. So it's a, yeah,

733
00:44:06,231 --> 00:44:09,860
it's a positive association just in
the name. It's an enterprise tool,

734
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:12,740
although you can use it for, I have,
I'm on like four or five teams down,

735
00:44:12,741 --> 00:44:15,530
including some that are just
groups of friends. Uh, but it's,

736
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:19,190
it's really pleasant to use like it's
consumer grade and I'm in consumer grade

737
00:44:19,191 --> 00:44:21,260
as a compliment.
You mean the Ui?

738
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:24,860
Like the user experience is
consumer friendly and user friendly.

739
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:29,950
It could compete with a Facebook or a
Twitter for its usability versus where

740
00:44:30,051 --> 00:44:31,500
most enterprise software just,

741
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:37,020
and I was looked by as designed by
someone who was very unhappy. And

742
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:43,800
why not use p two for
the IRC? Like chat. Oh,

743
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:48,180
um, it's not chat. Okay.
So p two is threaded.

744
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:51,740
It is real time, but you wouldn't use
it like a chat client. Got It. Um,

745
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:55,680
where slack is a chronological,

746
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:59,450
so there's no threading and
yeah, it's instantaneous. It
comes to your phone. It's,

747
00:44:59,451 --> 00:45:01,290
it's more like I am application.
Got It.

748
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,060
And would you use [inaudible] for project
management type stuff as well? We do,

749
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:08,980
yeah. Okay. We have bug trackers.
Different teams use different things.

750
00:45:08,981 --> 00:45:12,160
I mean as fabricators, some use
get hub, some use track, uh,

751
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:15,420
we allow teams a lot of autonomy in
choosing the tools there. But, um,

752
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:19,070
all the communication really happens on
Pto. So think PTO replacement for email,

753
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:23,340
a slack or replacement
for Skype, Skype. I am,

754
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:28,180
and that's really between those two.
You can take over the world. I love it.

755
00:45:28,870 --> 00:45:33,240
And, uh, for those people
who are not aware of, uh,

756
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:37,240
who are not part of the tech
world, no, no, that was a,

757
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:41,760
that was a coaster that was
a very metallic Scandinavian
coaster that was stuck

758
00:45:41,761 --> 00:45:45,330
to the bottom of the glass. It's, that's
the downside of these coasters. Uh,

759
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,760
we're sitting at my place,
chilling.

760
00:45:47,761 --> 00:45:52,350
We were going to do Tequila sipping a,
I don't want to incriminate Matt,

761
00:45:52,830 --> 00:45:56,700
but I have to get on the
road a little bit later.

762
00:45:56,701 --> 00:45:57,950
So I don't want to have a,

763
00:45:58,070 --> 00:46:00,330
I don't wanna be swimming in
the Casa that are going to us,

764
00:46:00,331 --> 00:46:04,530
which is my favorite spectacular. But
it's my favorite too. It's so good.

765
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:08,880
It is good. And just to digress because
this is worth digressing on. Uh,

766
00:46:08,881 --> 00:46:10,290
I was introduced to
customs that are going to,

767
00:46:10,291 --> 00:46:15,291
is the first time because I ended up
doing some military training with uh,

768
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:18,510
some, some active guys, uh,

769
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:23,160
and some deployed guys when they were
back for a brief period and they would,

770
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:27,210
uh, they would do a full day of shooting
exercises and then they would dismantle

771
00:46:27,211 --> 00:46:30,490
their guns and clean their guns while
slowly sipping. Casa did I go in,

772
00:46:30,491 --> 00:46:35,160
it's like the most manly session ever
and had no ammo around, very safe.

773
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:38,190
And I never liked Tequila.

774
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:43,280
I'd always disliked to kill him and he'd
given me a horrible hangover and a Casa

775
00:46:43,591 --> 00:46:48,510
dog [inaudible] is not intended to be
mixed with anything and it's just amazing.

776
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:52,380
I think Tequila is the most underrated
alcohol actually. And it's very expensive.

777
00:46:52,381 --> 00:46:57,000
So for people who it's something,
it's for special occasions for sure.

778
00:46:57,180 --> 00:47:00,270
People have a bad impression of Tequila
because they drink a bunch of stuff and

779
00:47:00,271 --> 00:47:01,950
then at end at night
they do it Tequila shot.

780
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:05,300
So they've mixed like 20
different alcohols or they
drink things like Margaritas

781
00:47:05,301 --> 00:47:09,720
that are full of sugar that are like
incident hangovers from me. But just like,

782
00:47:09,721 --> 00:47:11,550
uh, yeah, I love Casa turn on us.

783
00:47:11,551 --> 00:47:14,220
I was introduced to it by a friend in
New York named Shanti and she was like,

784
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:16,470
you have to check this out.
I was like, oh, come on.

785
00:47:16,471 --> 00:47:19,530
Why am I going to pay it as much? I was
like, wow, this to is delicious. Yeah,

786
00:47:19,531 --> 00:47:22,240
it's amazing actually if you drink,
I believe that.

787
00:47:22,241 --> 00:47:24,960
So if you stick to just Tequila
and it's a good Tequila,

788
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:27,510
like I don Julio 1942 is also pretty good.

789
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:29,710
If stick to good Tequila all night long.

790
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:33,910
Obviously with limits, you don't, you're
not hung over in the morning. No, I agree.

791
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,580
So if you're looking for
a hangover cure guys, uh,

792
00:47:36,670 --> 00:47:41,670
you could test responsibly a
civic tequila personal tools.

793
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:45,670
I'd love to talk about some tools
that you have, say on your laptop.

794
00:47:46,090 --> 00:47:50,800
So one of them that you introduced
me to that I love is momentum. Yeah.

795
00:47:50,830 --> 00:47:51,850
Could you explain momentum?

796
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:56,590
So momentum is an extension for
chrome that when you launch a new tab,

797
00:47:57,010 --> 00:48:01,870
it shows you a beautiful picture. Uh,
it says, you know, Hi Matt. Hi Tim.

798
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:05,320
You put in your name, you, I guess you
could have been, could put in my name,

799
00:48:05,321 --> 00:48:09,310
but I have to be creepy
and it asks you a question,

800
00:48:09,311 --> 00:48:12,130
what is your focus for today?
It has a light to do thing I don't use,

801
00:48:12,131 --> 00:48:13,220
but really for me it's,

802
00:48:13,221 --> 00:48:16,240
it shows the time and she's this beautiful
picture and often like a nice little

803
00:48:16,241 --> 00:48:19,900
quote at the bottom, whether in the
corner, just, it's kind of a clean,

804
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:23,770
fun thing that when you launch a tab,
because by default and chrome,

805
00:48:23,771 --> 00:48:27,400
I feel like before it was like your
most recently or most frequently visited

806
00:48:27,401 --> 00:48:29,890
sites,
which is distractions essential for me.

807
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,430
So I'd be launching a new tab and be like,
oh, let me click this tech meme. Like,

808
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:36,790
oh. And then 20 minutes later you're
like, what am I doing? Not only that,

809
00:48:36,791 --> 00:48:40,520
but if you open a new tab, uh, I find
it useful. Personally. It's, I'm,

810
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:42,640
the photos are just amazing.
They're so gorgeous.

811
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:46,270
It bugs me that the quotes have
no attribution at a new feature.

812
00:48:46,271 --> 00:48:48,880
If you hover over the quote,
it will tell you who it's from.

813
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:53,770
I feel like that should just be displayed.
They removed it a little while ago.

814
00:48:53,771 --> 00:48:56,590
I don't know why, but now if you hover
over the quoted, I'll tell you it's fine.

815
00:48:56,770 --> 00:49:00,790
But the photos are absolutely stunning,
which catches your attention.

816
00:49:00,791 --> 00:49:03,790
And the reason that's
important is when you,

817
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:08,820
each day it'll prompt you to type an
answer for what is your focus for today.

818
00:49:09,310 --> 00:49:11,920
And then it will display that every
time you open a new tab. And for me,

819
00:49:11,921 --> 00:49:15,430
if I open a tab to do
something unimportant, trivial,

820
00:49:15,431 --> 00:49:19,300
or just that is a pure distraction,
I'll be like, oh, oh yeah,

821
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:21,610
I should really get back to that.
The road,

822
00:49:21,611 --> 00:49:25,420
the heck is paid with lots of
new tap tone down language.

823
00:49:25,421 --> 00:49:29,560
This is a family program, man.
Uh, so what other, what other, uh,

824
00:49:29,650 --> 00:49:34,300
tweaks or tools do you have on
your laptop you find helpful?

825
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:37,570
Ah, definitely, uh, among
constantly simple notes.

826
00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:41,020
So that's actually a company. I
liked it so much. We acquired it.

827
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:46,240
The company automatic bought a few years
ago and it's a very simple notes app

828
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:50,950
that synchronizes instantly
basically across web, Ios,

829
00:49:50,951 --> 00:49:53,380
android, desktop. There's a
great desktop client for Mac,

830
00:49:53,381 --> 00:49:57,190
so I pretty much live
in that new additions.

831
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:00,070
I started using Wunderlist.
Wunderlist,

832
00:50:00,071 --> 00:50:01,560
I've heard a lot of good
things about funder list.

833
00:50:01,561 --> 00:50:06,040
It's like w analyst Chad Feller works
there now. Oh cool. I'm good guy.

834
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:09,940
Really liked it. So I just started
doing that this year actually. Um,

835
00:50:10,190 --> 00:50:14,800
is on my computer, Spotify,
you know, standard stuff.

836
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:18,550
What, uh, what are some of your
other most used apps on your,

837
00:50:19,210 --> 00:50:24,160
your smartphone? Hmm, well, obviously
wordpress. Yeah, of course. Okay.

838
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:27,750
I'll get the plugs out of the way in the
beginning. So let's say wordpress note.

839
00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:32,420
Got It. Chan from messaging,

840
00:50:32,421 --> 00:50:36,500
I've actually become really in the
telegram, telegram. So telegram.org,

841
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:40,970
it is a free fast and uh,
encrypted,

842
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:45,980
optional, really good encryption by
the way, a messaging app that's isn't,

843
00:50:45,981 --> 00:50:46,701
Facebook isn't,

844
00:50:46,701 --> 00:50:49,730
whatsapp isn't anything else and it's
super good and they have a desktop client

845
00:50:49,731 --> 00:50:53,540
as well. I like what's that? But like I'm
on my computer the majority of the day,

846
00:50:53,541 --> 00:50:55,250
so I need to be able
to message from there.

847
00:50:55,700 --> 00:51:00,470
And I message only works with iPhone,
other ios devices. So it's pretty nice.

848
00:51:00,471 --> 00:51:05,060
So telegram you can use on your phone and
on your laptop. Yeah. Which I love. My,

849
00:51:05,061 --> 00:51:07,700
I is broken. I won't, I won't
pull you in for tech support,

850
00:51:07,701 --> 00:51:12,380
but I'll do it after he's
telegraph. Um, slack,

851
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:16,340
uh, something. So in terms of like
making myself a better person,

852
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,570
the row is the seven minute workout app.
Uh,

853
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:25,000
calm.com which I'm an investor in and
kindle in a reading kindles meditation up.

854
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:29,090
Now I'm not, not, that is
not the meditation APP.

855
00:51:29,390 --> 00:51:32,630
I need to do some more dual dual end
back training though. I got those.

856
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:36,530
Those terrible called is a meditation mat.
Yes.

857
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:41,690
How often do you meditate? Not
Enough. I feel like that's dodge.

858
00:51:41,990 --> 00:51:44,840
Is that once a month or what's not enough?
Um,

859
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:49,730
so where I am in this New Year is I'm
trying to do it for five minutes per day.

860
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:51,920
That's perfect.
That's just where I'm starting out.

861
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:56,270
I'm actually inspired a lot by you talking
and telling me about how meditation's

862
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:59,870
becoming a big part of your life. Uh, I'd
like to work up to where it's, you know,

863
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:02,840
maybe a twice a day or media session.
Um,

864
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:05,420
but I've struggled a little bit
even when that five minutes.

865
00:52:05,421 --> 00:52:09,740
So putting call on my home screen and
just kind of just saying, you know,

866
00:52:09,741 --> 00:52:11,180
you can do anything for five minutes.

867
00:52:11,490 --> 00:52:14,250
There's really no excuses for
not doing five minutes a day, um,

868
00:52:14,930 --> 00:52:16,430
can eat tonight for fitness.

869
00:52:16,431 --> 00:52:20,650
One of the things I did a while back
was I would just try to do like, oh,

870
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:23,720
it started with one. So just before
I got in the shower, do one pushup.

871
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:27,440
And no matter how late you're running,
no matter what's going on in the world,

872
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:31,100
you can't argue against doing one pushup.
Like, right, come on, there's no excuse.

873
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:32,630
So I have to find,

874
00:52:32,631 --> 00:52:37,040
I just need to like get over that initial
hump yet with something that's almost

875
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:41,510
embarrassingly small as a goal
and then that can become a habit.

876
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:46,370
I think this illustrates a
really important principle,
which is rigging the game.

877
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:49,640
So you can win. People don't like
to fail. And if you set the pass,

878
00:52:49,641 --> 00:52:52,760
fail mark too high for an activity.
For instance,

879
00:52:52,790 --> 00:52:55,340
a lot of people make
new year's resolutions.

880
00:52:55,341 --> 00:52:57,350
They decide they're going to go
to the gym four times a week.

881
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,920
That's too much for someone who
doesn't go to the gym at all. Yeah.

882
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:02,050
And if that's the past,
Phil,

883
00:53:02,051 --> 00:53:04,430
Mark and you go three times a week
are going to feel like a failure.

884
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:09,431
Whereas if you psychologically set the
the hurdle at one time per week for

885
00:53:12,111 --> 00:53:14,870
instance, and you only have to
spend 15 minutes of the gym,

886
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:20,480
then you can earn bonus credits by doing
what would've previously been viewed as

887
00:53:20,481 --> 00:53:24,530
a failure. Right? Someone should
write a book on that, right?

888
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:26,160
God,
I can't do another

889
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:26,993
600 pager.

890
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:31,260
We're the four hour body has another
point that I think is very important,

891
00:53:31,261 --> 00:53:32,680
which is,
uh,

892
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:36,390
the layering of behaviors
or sequencing and behaviors.

893
00:53:36,391 --> 00:53:39,600
So if someone has a 100 pounds
to lose or 50 pounds to lose,

894
00:53:39,601 --> 00:53:42,370
I think exercise is the
wrong place to start. Uh,

895
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,240
for a whole host of
reasons because of diet.

896
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:47,910
Exercise is the wrong place to start.

897
00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:52,590
A diet is the right place to start
because exercise is an additive behavior.

898
00:53:52,591 --> 00:53:55,110
It's something they don't currently
do that they have to make time for.

899
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:57,900
Whereas especially if they're overweight,
they're definitely eating.

900
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:04,940
So they have set aside time to eat and
they're just substituting in different

901
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:08,160
default meals, which is
very, very, very easy. Uh,

902
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:12,780
met my first a slow carb follower
who's lost 200 pounds recently.

903
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:16,800
Wow. Yeah, that's a lot. That's a lot
of pounds. That's a lot of pounds.

904
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:19,860
It was a question I wanted to ask
you if it's okay to, yeah, sure.

905
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:22,650
I've been reading a little bit more
about fasting and intermittent fasting,

906
00:54:22,651 --> 00:54:23,340
so yeah,

907
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:26,940
there was like a couple of tweets worth
of advice you would give for fasting.

908
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,550
Yeah, definitely. All right.

909
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:32,970
I think interim if you have
incredible discipline. Uh,

910
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:37,140
I think the intermittent
fasting, uh, for instance, um,

911
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:41,940
I think his name is Martin Birkin, lean
gains. I think he does quite a bit here.

912
00:54:42,590 --> 00:54:46,440
Uh,
he may or may not be a fan of my stuff.

913
00:54:46,441 --> 00:54:48,960
He's not a fan of a lot of people up,
but that's fine.

914
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:51,090
I'm okay with it because
even if he doesn't like me,

915
00:54:51,091 --> 00:54:52,950
I think he's a good resource
for intermittent fasting.

916
00:54:53,510 --> 00:54:57,630
A lot of people who sustain
intermittent fasting.

917
00:54:57,750 --> 00:54:58,531
And I'm not saying Martin,

918
00:54:58,531 --> 00:55:03,060
I'm saying a lot of other people who
are figureheads in that community, uh,

919
00:55:03,090 --> 00:55:07,020
consume massive amounts of two
things on the male side. Caffeine,

920
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:10,140
they consume a lot of stimulants and uh,

921
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:12,660
some of them consume
anabolics like Diana Ball,

922
00:55:12,661 --> 00:55:16,290
which is an oral anabolic intergenic
steroid that inhibits appetite

923
00:55:16,291 --> 00:55:19,350
significantly. Uh, so you want to,

924
00:55:19,410 --> 00:55:23,700
I would encourage you to test
intermittent fasting and see how you feel.

925
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:29,970
But I personally prefer, and I'll be
writing quite a bit about this, uh,

926
00:55:29,971 --> 00:55:34,020
to do a,
I did a seven day distilled water fast.

927
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:35,400
And I think the,

928
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:40,460
I think the longevity benefits known and
unknown and health benefits known and

929
00:55:41,281 --> 00:55:43,950
unknown of doing that are,
are very significant.

930
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:47,650
And it happens if you don't
distill the water. Well, you know,

931
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,590
that is a great question.
They don't,

932
00:55:49,591 --> 00:55:53,400
the doctors who supervise me did not
want me to be consuming any supplemental

933
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:54,840
minerals or electrolytes,

934
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,150
which was interesting because I
thought it would be the opposite.

935
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:59,490
And in some cases when
people get very weak,

936
00:55:59,491 --> 00:56:04,170
they'll supplement with say bully on
broth or something like that. But uh,

937
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:07,920
they don't want you to be ingesting any
type of supplemental minerals, vitamins,

938
00:56:07,970 --> 00:56:12,150
etc. And, uh, that was
a tremendous experience.

939
00:56:12,151 --> 00:56:15,480
I actually want to do that at least
once a quarter and possibly do a 14 day.

940
00:56:15,930 --> 00:56:19,140
I just read where like after the
third day of like a water fast,

941
00:56:19,141 --> 00:56:23,290
you start producing more white blood
cells, your body starts to say, uh, yeah,

942
00:56:23,291 --> 00:56:25,630
I mean that, that wouldn't surprise me
at all. I'd have to look at my labs.

943
00:56:25,630 --> 00:56:28,200
Of course I did tonight.
I did your analysis every day and,

944
00:56:28,610 --> 00:56:29,840
and loud you way your poop.

945
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:32,980
I did not weigh my poo because I got
to tell you there's not much poo.

946
00:56:32,981 --> 00:56:36,920
When you're not eating for
seven days, uh, by, uh, you,

947
00:56:36,930 --> 00:56:39,370
you have to be careful with the amount
of water you drink because if you're not

948
00:56:39,371 --> 00:56:43,690
consuming any sources
of salt, uh, you can,

949
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:46,810
you can develop, you can overconsume
water just like anything else.

950
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:51,550
And there have been examples of people
who've died as a result of say radio show

951
00:56:51,551 --> 00:56:54,700
competitions where they have competitions
to see who can drink the most water.

952
00:56:54,701 --> 00:56:55,534
It's a terrible idea,

953
00:56:56,740 --> 00:56:59,320
I think it's called is things aren't
ready or Cambodian new tree mia,

954
00:56:59,321 --> 00:57:01,450
I think it is, which is a, a,

955
00:57:01,451 --> 00:57:06,451
an extreme lack of sodium and other
things that that interferes with your

956
00:57:07,271 --> 00:57:11,200
ability to conduct electricity
and muscles like the heart. Uh,

957
00:57:11,230 --> 00:57:14,200
but the intimate fasting for the,

958
00:57:14,490 --> 00:57:17,020
it works for a lot of people very well.

959
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:22,270
But the vast majority of people I have
seen who use it end up using crutches of

960
00:57:22,271 --> 00:57:23,860
some type like stimulants.

961
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:27,670
So you trade one problem for
another and in fact you can,

962
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:31,360
you can also end up losing fat,
not because of the intermittent fasting,

963
00:57:31,361 --> 00:57:35,060
but because you're consuming
six cups of coffee a day. Uh,

964
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:39,910
so I just don't drink coffee. What's
that? I still don't drink coffee. Why not?

965
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:43,280
You know, I think I have enough
vices in my life. Are you an,

966
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:46,050
are you an investor in a coffee company?
Blue bottle coffee.

967
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:50,020
So I don't drink coffee,
but when I do blue bottle is the,

968
00:57:50,690 --> 00:57:54,610
uh, no. Okay. You don't have to
answer this, but I'm curious.

969
00:57:54,850 --> 00:57:57,030
What are some of your other,
uh,

970
00:57:58,450 --> 00:58:02,980
suitable for Mr. Rogers vices? What
are some of the other advices? Wine,

971
00:58:02,981 --> 00:58:07,030
women and song, right. It's all goes back
to the classics. Those are places again.

972
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:09,640
Um,
no,

973
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:14,750
I feel like probably the thing I struggle
with the most is because my work and

974
00:58:16,581 --> 00:58:19,580
what I do is connected.
Now I'm talking to people online.

975
00:58:19,581 --> 00:58:24,200
I'm on my computer and especially
since taking over as CEO the past year,

976
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:28,650
what I really had to do is
unscheduled more on my life. Right.

977
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:30,950
Create more space. Right. Um,

978
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:36,520
read a lot more than I used to because
I find that when I don't have that space

979
00:58:36,591 --> 00:58:40,370
where I'm just in the, I'm not going to
call it flow. When a men sort of like the,

980
00:58:41,030 --> 00:58:46,030
the hedonistic treadmill of pings
and chats and tweets and not even,

981
00:58:46,670 --> 00:58:49,010
not even necessarily being distracted
by like Facebook or Twitter,

982
00:58:49,011 --> 00:58:50,610
but like even just work stuff,
right?

983
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:56,000
You don't take that step back that allows
you to have the creative inspiration

984
00:58:56,001 --> 00:58:58,880
or the ideas for the
next big thing or the uh,

985
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:02,990
your mind works to the problem in a
different way. Right. The deloading phase,

986
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:04,340
there's blocks of time.

987
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:09,680
What have you found helpful
for creating that space?

988
00:59:10,730 --> 00:59:13,940
Oh, another interesting thing about
automatic is we have almost no meetings.

989
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:15,660
Let's talk about it.

990
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:20,030
And so I only have three standing
meetings at automatic standing,

991
00:59:20,031 --> 00:59:22,220
meaning physically
Staley. Oh No. Standing.

992
00:59:22,221 --> 00:59:24,800
Like it's always standing on a calendar.
I see.

993
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:29,750
So every other week.
What makes those meetings worth doing?

994
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:31,610
Um,

995
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:36,380
so there are meetings with
groups of people who are
responsible for three areas.

996
00:59:36,381 --> 00:59:40,940
That automatic, one for
all of wordpress.com and
everything related there.

997
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:43,850
One for jet pack and
all the plugins we make.

998
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:48,500
And then one we just called business,
they're called a.com.

999
00:59:48,501 --> 00:59:52,880
Dot org.biz. So the commission, the
organization and the Bids Group,

1000
00:59:53,210 --> 00:59:54,620
um,
and businesses,

1001
00:59:54,621 --> 00:59:58,760
basically all the people who work on
making money at automatic. Right. Got It.

1002
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:03,580
It's all the VIP guys on
that team adds, so the, the,

1003
01:00:03,581 --> 01:00:05,300
the commercial side,
because to be honest,

1004
01:00:05,301 --> 01:00:10,160
the vast majority of [inaudible]
don't think about revenue at all.

1005
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:13,640
Yeah. There's just a few of us at
shoulder. The burden for everyone else.

1006
01:00:14,690 --> 01:00:16,130
It's really a good thing. I mean, what,

1007
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:20,840
what do the other people
primarily focus on? Um,

1008
01:00:20,930 --> 01:00:24,680
I don't know. Comics, Tequila,

1009
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:28,340
what they're having for lunch. I
mean, you think about the user,

1010
01:00:28,670 --> 01:00:33,080
you think about the experience,
you think about what is the thing,

1011
01:00:35,450 --> 01:00:40,450
the hardest thing is spending the most
time on the most important things just in

1012
01:00:40,551 --> 01:00:43,310
life in general. Definitely. And
especially when building products,

1013
01:00:43,311 --> 01:00:44,061
like it's so easy.

1014
01:00:44,061 --> 01:00:47,390
There's a term in open source called
bike shedding and it's this idea,

1015
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:50,540
do you know what I do? But I want
you to explain it. This is concept,

1016
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:52,670
I'm going to butcher the story,
but you know,

1017
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:57,880
someone brings a proposal for a nuclear
plant and a to a city council and it's,

1018
01:00:58,491 --> 01:01:02,480
you know, this 200 page thing and they
kind of flipped through it and um,

1019
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:05,810
but it's like too much for people to
comprehend and then not nuclear physicist

1020
01:01:05,811 --> 01:01:08,360
or activist anyway,
so they're just kind of rubber stamp it.

1021
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:13,280
And then the next person up wants to
build a bike shed off the main road and

1022
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:16,280
everyone has an opinion like what
color the bike shed should be.

1023
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:19,130
Should it accommodate
tandem bicycles should,

1024
01:01:19,870 --> 01:01:21,470
which color should it be?

1025
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:26,270
And so there's an amazing website called
bike shed.org and a cool feature of it

1026
01:01:26,271 --> 01:01:28,520
is that you can type in
as a sub domain a color.

1027
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:33,380
So we type green.bike shed.org
it'll give you a green background.

1028
01:01:33,381 --> 01:01:35,600
And then the text of this
original mailing list posts,

1029
01:01:35,601 --> 01:01:40,130
which is like a BSD thing from like
probably 13 or 14 years ago now. Um,

1030
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:45,250
that tells a story and talks about how
usually proportionately the more trivial

1031
01:01:45,981 --> 01:01:46,641
something is,

1032
01:01:46,641 --> 01:01:50,960
the more likely it is that lots of people
have opinions and feel like they can

1033
01:01:50,961 --> 01:01:54,320
have an impact on it.
That's so true.

1034
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:59,380
And I want to talk about also
you're auditioning process,

1035
01:02:05,290 --> 01:02:09,430
but first we're going to hear a few words

1038

We're going to talk about
his auditioning process,

1039
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:20,790
what he has in his carry on bag.
This man travels the world all the time.

1040
01:02:20,791 --> 01:02:24,300
We're going to talk about
investing Warren buffet music,

1041
01:02:24,450 --> 01:02:29,450
his rituals around productivity as it
relates to music and on and on and on.

1042
01:02:29,881 --> 01:02:33,600
So please don't go away and here you go.

And now back to our show,

1064
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:55,680
we've taken a potty break,

1065
01:03:55,681 --> 01:04:00,210
which gave us a chance to upgrade our
beverage since I've canceled my driving

1066
01:04:00,211 --> 01:04:05,070
plans this evening from t to Tequila.
So bear with me one moment,

1067
01:04:05,130 --> 01:04:05,881
uh,
actually met,

1068
01:04:05,881 --> 01:04:10,881
perhaps you could elucidate enlightened
us about some of your favorite music at

1069
01:04:11,191 --> 01:04:15,690
the moment while I, while I very geisha
like pour us some lovely Tequila.

1070
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:19,730
I will be monitoring your
technique. Um, yeah, I,

1071
01:04:19,830 --> 01:04:22,970
I'm so late to the game
by just discovered, uh,

1072
01:04:23,670 --> 01:04:26,790
about say Tila Tequila because
I did not just as governor,

1073
01:04:27,090 --> 01:04:30,900
I discovered Sam Smith the
opposite of Tila Tequila, um,

1074
01:04:31,530 --> 01:04:35,520
who just, his voice is super haunting.
Um, but enjoying milky chance.

1075
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:39,330
Lately they have a cool song
called stolen Tila Tequila.

1076
01:04:39,630 --> 01:04:44,520
Now they have a cool song called a
stolen dance. What type of music is that?

1077
01:04:44,550 --> 01:04:48,120
What would you call that?
That's interesting. So they
have kind of a reggae feel,

1078
01:04:48,630 --> 01:04:52,860
but it's like a guy with a guitar and
sings combined with a guy who kind of

1079
01:04:52,861 --> 01:04:56,400
plays the laptop, like more of like
a beat, almost like a DJ. Very cool.

1080
01:04:56,490 --> 01:05:00,680
And I saw them live in San Francisco.
Great show. And I'm that same I,

1081
01:05:00,681 --> 01:05:05,340
I listened to a lot of hip hop and a lot
of jazz. And you play instruments also?

1082
01:05:06,090 --> 01:05:09,830
Yeah, primarily saxophone. When did
you learn to play the saxophone? Well,

1083
01:05:09,831 --> 01:05:13,140
I started in second or third grade.
Really? Yeah. So I started pretty young.

1084
01:05:13,141 --> 01:05:15,180
My Dad Played Sax so I
always want to do it.

1085
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:19,660
And I had gotten kicked out of
piano for doing what? I don't know.

1086
01:05:19,661 --> 01:05:22,630
They said I had no musical talent,
so on to prove them wrong.

1087
01:05:23,890 --> 01:05:28,750
What is wrong with some teachers?
Believable. Cheers by the way. Cheers

1088
01:05:31,090 --> 01:05:32,020
Andy.
Uh,

1089
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:37,780
so the saxophone was your
transition from piano and, uh,

1090
01:05:39,850 --> 01:05:40,900
is there anything,

1091
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:46,420
are there any skills that you
developed through the, uh,

1092
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:49,750
through the sacs that have had,
that have translated to coding

1093
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:55,030
or anything else? You do?
Almost everything. Um,

1094
01:05:55,750 --> 01:06:00,750
so from how to breathe and be on stage
in front of people for speaking gigs and

1095
01:06:03,881 --> 01:06:07,660
whatnot or just anything, you know,
you're in front of a group of people, um,

1096
01:06:08,140 --> 01:06:11,800
how to interact. So in jazz is all about
listening and responding. You know,

1097
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:16,270
you're kind of co composing on the fly
when you're improvising or in a quartet

1098
01:06:16,271 --> 01:06:19,300
or something.
I had to learn new things.

1099
01:06:19,301 --> 01:06:22,450
So sometimes for different,

1100
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:25,210
if I played in like I'm musical
theater band or something like that,

1101
01:06:25,211 --> 01:06:29,730
like I need to double on Piccolo or
flute or clarinet or another instrument.

1102
01:06:29,731 --> 01:06:34,390
So I'd have to learn that
fairly quickly. Um, and just,

1103
01:06:34,450 --> 01:06:36,880
I would say most importantly,
the concept of deliberate practice,

1104
01:06:37,780 --> 01:06:39,850
which I know you're a big fan of,
just absolutely.

1105
01:06:40,150 --> 01:06:44,200
I remember I had a teacher once who told
me like if you only practice the things

1106
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:47,530
ray sound good, you're never
going to get better. You recap,

1107
01:06:47,650 --> 01:06:50,140
you reach kind of a local
maximum and that was a trap.

1108
01:06:50,170 --> 01:06:51,680
I actually had fallen Eczema.

1109
01:06:52,450 --> 01:06:55,930
I need to learn what this
is just a a constrained,

1110
01:06:57,010 --> 01:06:58,850
constrained maximum.
Yeah.

1111
01:06:58,851 --> 01:07:02,380
You reached the best that you're going
to get within this sort of limited sphere

1112
01:07:02,381 --> 01:07:03,250
of limited sphere.

1113
01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:08,460
You're not moving on to the next fear
and especially back when I was young,

1114
01:07:09,191 --> 01:07:13,420
I think I was more self conscious and
so when I practice and it'd be at school

1115
01:07:13,421 --> 01:07:14,254
or at home,

1116
01:07:14,380 --> 01:07:19,380
I'd want to sound good for whoever
might walk by or hear me or anything and

1117
01:07:19,871 --> 01:07:20,920
that's not how you get better.

1118
01:07:20,921 --> 01:07:24,700
You just kind of get really good at
the 10 things that you're practicing.

1119
01:07:25,090 --> 01:07:27,760
But the people who practice
the best sound terrible.

1120
01:07:28,150 --> 01:07:32,070
I think they're squawking and squeaking
and doing long tones and overtones.

1121
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:33,940
They sound like they're,
it's funny,

1122
01:07:33,941 --> 01:07:36,480
one of the most best things you can
do to sound better on saxophone is,

1123
01:07:36,490 --> 01:07:37,600
was what's called long tones,

1124
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:42,610
which just playing a single note for a
really long time and then go into the

1125
01:07:42,611 --> 01:07:45,460
next note and playing that for a really
long time. Why does that make you better?

1126
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:49,600
Um, is it an endurance thing? It helps
your ambition and your tone. Your what?

1127
01:07:49,860 --> 01:07:51,070
Ombre. Sure. What does that,

1128
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:56,100
so the ombre shirt is basically the
position and firmness of your mouth around

1129
01:07:57,191 --> 01:08:00,010
the mouthpiece and
basically that it's the,

1130
01:08:00,030 --> 01:08:04,770
it's basically the seal around the
maltreatment jokes or think of like a,

1131
01:08:04,771 --> 01:08:06,910
a brass instrument when,
you know,

1132
01:08:06,911 --> 01:08:10,060
they have this sort of circular mouthpiece
and they do like that sort of thing

1133
01:08:10,061 --> 01:08:13,540
inside of it. Um, they use an
Omniture to change the pitch.

1134
01:08:13,870 --> 01:08:17,780
So you, the position of the math,
it's also the position of your throat,

1135
01:08:17,810 --> 01:08:20,510
the way the air is flowing, the position
of your tongue inside your mouth,

1136
01:08:20,511 --> 01:08:23,030
that determines where the air goes.
It's different for different instruments,

1137
01:08:23,031 --> 01:08:27,610
but ultimately that, and the breast
support is what determines your tone. Hmm.

1138
01:08:28,190 --> 01:08:29,023
And

1139
01:08:32,530 --> 01:08:33,363
Yeah.

1140
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:37,570
You, uh, listen to a lot of music.

1141
01:08:37,571 --> 01:08:39,010
You're an avid consumer of music.

1142
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:44,520
Do you still listen when you work to one
track or a handful of tracks on repeat?

1143
01:08:46,630 --> 01:08:50,770
I do. Tell it to explain
this. Explain what, uh,

1144
01:08:51,550 --> 01:08:55,660
the last thing that you, that you listened
to in this way and why you do that. Um,

1145
01:08:55,750 --> 01:09:00,250
literally today, this Sam Smith
Song, uh, I'm not the only one, uh,

1146
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:03,880
which is actually just blogged about it.
Check it. Oh, I can plug my blog man. Dot.

1147
01:09:03,881 --> 01:09:07,360
T t does a great domain
name. Thank you. Yeah. Um,

1148
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:08,910
where's t t Trinidad and Tobago.

1149
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:11,770
Trinidad and Tobago actually just
renewed it for another three years,

1150
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:17,230
the wildly three years. I'm curious
out. It's a really weird, you know,

1151
01:09:17,231 --> 01:09:21,490
it was unregistered when I got it. So
just luck of the draw. Yeah. I literally,

1152
01:09:21,550 --> 01:09:23,800
well, it wasn't luck of the jar,
just no one went through the,

1153
01:09:24,220 --> 01:09:27,770
the jump you had to go through to
register it as it's a pain in the ass and

1154
01:09:27,780 --> 01:09:31,900
trying to wire money to Trinidad.
And I was in my,

1155
01:09:31,901 --> 01:09:34,150
I was in like the Bank of America
on third and Brandon or something,

1156
01:09:34,151 --> 01:09:37,330
fourth and Brandon and they're like, sir,
are you sure about this? I'm like, yeah,

1157
01:09:37,331 --> 01:09:40,780
yeah, it's fine. I read on the Internet,
it's fine. The internet said it's,

1158
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:45,240
it's okay. Someone contacted me, I'm going
to send them a couple of grand and I,

1159
01:09:45,370 --> 01:09:45,490
yeah,

1160
01:09:45,490 --> 01:09:49,300
they were very concerned about the money
I was wearing to this Trinidadian Bank.

1161
01:09:49,930 --> 01:09:51,690
But um, yeah, the,

1162
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:57,000
I find that on your blog you put a video
of just a youtube music video for the

1163
01:09:59,681 --> 01:10:01,020
song, but the, um,

1164
01:10:01,090 --> 01:10:04,600
that's just because youtube is the
easiest way to share music now. Sure. The,

1165
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:09,010
the Nice thing about a song on
repeat is that I can really enjoy it,

1166
01:10:09,340 --> 01:10:13,000
but something about it allows my
brain to background it as well. Um,

1167
01:10:13,050 --> 01:10:15,790
I have a couple of albums that I
can do the entire album on repeat,

1168
01:10:16,210 --> 01:10:18,220
but what I can't do is
something new or novel.

1169
01:10:18,220 --> 01:10:23,110
So like a Pandora or Spotify or radio
distracts me because I'm like, oh,

1170
01:10:23,111 --> 01:10:25,510
what's this?
And then I'll start next day.

1171
01:10:25,511 --> 01:10:28,480
I know I'm like on the artist's page
and on their Wikipedia and like really

1172
01:10:28,481 --> 01:10:31,630
digging into it. So I really want
something I've heard sometimes,

1173
01:10:31,631 --> 01:10:33,040
literally a thousand times before.

1174
01:10:33,100 --> 01:10:36,490
What are some of the other songs that
you've heard a thousand times? Um,

1175
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:40,990
I really like, uh, John Mayer's
who says who says I can't,

1176
01:10:40,991 --> 01:10:44,920
kids don't, which is kind
of funny cause I don't, uh,

1177
01:10:45,820 --> 01:10:49,920
what is another one? Um, some
Connie songs like gorgeous, um,

1178
01:10:50,350 --> 01:10:55,150
power. Yeah, there's just different,
whatever it is at the moment. Um,

1179
01:10:55,420 --> 01:10:58,570
oh, it's Kendrick Lamar is amazing. So
Kendrick Lamar has a song rigor mortis.

1180
01:10:58,590 --> 01:11:00,940
It's actually kind of upbeat,
so it's a pretty intense song.

1181
01:11:00,941 --> 01:11:03,460
And his lyrics are fast and
furious. He's, in my opinion,

1182
01:11:03,461 --> 01:11:06,000
the greatest lyricist of this generation.
What was the name of it?

1183
01:11:06,010 --> 01:11:10,230
I don't even recognize the
name. I'm Lamar. Kendrick
Lamar. Oh Man. Yeah. He um,

1184
01:11:10,570 --> 01:11:14,100
ever when someone told me that a year
ago who Taylor swift was, I'm really

1185
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:17,380
out of the slipstream of
pop culture. Um, yeah,

1186
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:21,750
Kendrick Lamar is definitely in my top
five favorite rappers right now. And He,

1187
01:11:21,751 --> 01:11:23,550
um,
yeah,

1188
01:11:23,551 --> 01:11:27,080
his music actually has a lot of jazz
influence on many things he does in their

1189
01:11:27,081 --> 01:11:31,620
song, rigor mortis samples,
a jazz track and um, it's,

1190
01:11:31,740 --> 01:11:36,580
all of these tracks are shorter.
So the, um, the Sam Smith is like,

1191
01:11:36,581 --> 01:11:41,490
I think three and a half minutes,
uh, who says is like two 56 or so,

1192
01:11:41,870 --> 01:11:44,970
um, rigor mortis is under three
minutes and just put them on a loop.

1193
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:46,620
So I borrowed that habit.

1194
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:51,680
Now remember you told me about this and
then I thought it was genius because uh,

1195
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:53,390
I,

1196
01:11:53,390 --> 01:11:57,780
I had used different albums for different
books and for those people who haven't

1197
01:11:57,781 --> 01:11:58,440
heard this,

1198
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:02,880
because it does help some people a lot
to write if you're writing period is best

1199
01:12:02,881 --> 01:12:06,000
at night and you feel very isolated,
which I did late at night,

1200
01:12:06,001 --> 01:12:09,060
I generally did my best synthesis,
not research, not interviewing,

1201
01:12:09,061 --> 01:12:13,680
but synthesis from about 10:00 PM
to 5:00 AM and would be a loan.

1202
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:18,030
And it was just very
hermit like,

1203
01:12:18,270 --> 01:12:22,650
and I felt very isolated to be in
the quiet and darkness about myself.

1204
01:12:22,651 --> 01:12:26,730
So I would put in earphones, listened
to music on, repeat it very often,

1205
01:12:26,731 --> 01:12:30,450
something without vocals
and pendulum for instance.

1206
01:12:30,990 --> 01:12:35,820
And I would then watch the same
movie over and over and over again.

1207
01:12:35,821 --> 01:12:39,090
But it would just be my peripheral
vision because the images of human beings

1208
01:12:39,091 --> 01:12:43,430
would make me feel less isolated and
it was very comforting. So I had, uh,

1209
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:45,360
the Bourne identity,

1210
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:49,170
the first and Shaun of the dead
for the four hour work week.

1211
01:12:49,220 --> 01:12:52,560
You wanted the bond movies
too. Rail, I've seen hundreds,

1212
01:12:52,650 --> 01:12:55,260
probably thousands of times because
I would just leave it on repeat.

1213
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:58,440
So I might play five, six times a
night if I'm really in a session.

1214
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:01,140
And then for the four hour chef,

1215
01:13:01,141 --> 01:13:06,141
the funny addition was the first thing
that I clicked on Amazon prime that was

1216
01:13:06,181 --> 01:13:09,540
available on Amazon prime, which was
babe. So I ended up watching all the,

1217
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:13,590
with the pig with the pig farmer hogget
it. And it's actually a really movie.

1218
01:13:13,620 --> 01:13:17,220
Yeah, it's a brilliant movie.
There's a lot hidden in that movie.

1219
01:13:17,221 --> 01:13:18,270
There are a lot of subtle details.

1220
01:13:18,271 --> 01:13:23,070
Just like Kung Fu panda is g as a
genius that I have not seen. Oh,

1221
01:13:23,071 --> 01:13:25,350
it's, it's fantastic. I love when
they made these movies for kids,

1222
01:13:25,351 --> 01:13:28,590
but they put cool stuff
in there for adults, like
Aladdin and many other movies.

1223
01:13:28,620 --> 01:13:32,610
Yeah. Yeah. Really fantastic.
So, all right, so that's
the, that's the music trick.

1224
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:36,780
The repeat. I have a colleague who does
the movie thing and like I do. Yeah.

1225
01:13:36,950 --> 01:13:40,080
And I get the movie on mute
though. Oh really? Yeah.

1226
01:13:40,380 --> 01:13:44,280
And I listened to the music for him. He
does big Lebowski and a few others. But,

1227
01:13:44,310 --> 01:13:45,660
um,
the only,

1228
01:13:45,690 --> 01:13:48,990
the only variation I've introduced in
the past few years is that I like this

1229
01:13:49,050 --> 01:13:52,230
electronic Edm type group
called the Jane Doe's.

1230
01:13:52,590 --> 01:13:55,920
They're also friends and they do
some mixes and they have some,

1231
01:13:56,010 --> 01:13:58,350
I guess it's called trap music and rap.

1232
01:13:58,380 --> 01:14:01,020
This is where I'm getting out of
my element a little bit. But, um,

1233
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:04,650
I find that if I'm doing things like
email where I need to be a little bit

1234
01:14:04,651 --> 01:14:08,280
higher energy and go through a lot of
things, uh, that's really good for me.

1235
01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:12,250
I love it. Uh, auditions.

1236
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:17,200
Tell me about auditions.
What are, what are auditions,

1237
01:14:17,201 --> 01:14:20,050
how do they work in automatic?
Why auditions?

1238
01:14:22,030 --> 01:14:26,020
So one thing that's really important
when you're in a distributed company is,

1239
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:29,110
I mean there's no one looking over.
Your shoulder is no manager walking by.

1240
01:14:29,380 --> 01:14:32,290
There's no one even who knows
whether you started work,

1241
01:14:32,620 --> 01:14:34,840
where if you started work
at all or what time he did.

1242
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:39,520
So you really need to hire people
who are self motivated and can manage

1243
01:14:39,521 --> 01:14:40,720
themselves to some extent.

1244
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:46,200
A Ton of autumn additions were formerly
freelancers or Ctos at other companies

1245
01:14:46,211 --> 01:14:50,260
or things like that because they really
need a lot of ability to self direct,

1246
01:14:50,620 --> 01:14:53,860
have self management,
which is a tough skill.

1247
01:14:53,890 --> 01:14:56,560
Like it's still something that
I work on everyday of my life.

1248
01:14:57,250 --> 01:15:00,970
So what we found,
we've tried every hiring,

1249
01:15:01,540 --> 01:15:04,450
especially when we started, you know,
I was much younger and I thought,

1250
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:07,690
oh well we should do it like the other
companies do it. So we tried, you know,

1251
01:15:07,691 --> 01:15:11,350
how many manhole covers are there in
Manhattan and Mckinsey and Google Brain

1252
01:15:11,351 --> 01:15:14,020
teaser is the brain teasers or
the Google stopped doing them.

1253
01:15:14,290 --> 01:15:17,590
I think Microsoft is most famous for him.
So we did brain teasers,

1254
01:15:17,591 --> 01:15:18,610
we did coding tests,

1255
01:15:18,611 --> 01:15:21,940
we did a thing where you like ask a hard
technical problem and have them write

1256
01:15:21,941 --> 01:15:25,490
the code on the whiteboard.
We did it where 20 people
would interview the person,

1257
01:15:25,491 --> 01:15:26,620
not literally 20,
but you know,

1258
01:15:26,950 --> 01:15:31,950
like la interview after interview and
then you sort of get a consensus and not

1259
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:38,440
had a great correlation
with how productive and
great that person wasn't the

1260
01:15:39,101 --> 01:15:43,300
company later. Um, and I also
started seeing no correlation.

1261
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:45,040
I think because I dropped out of college,

1262
01:15:45,310 --> 01:15:47,920
I was very entranced by
people with masters or PhDs.

1263
01:15:48,110 --> 01:15:51,870
It turns out it has no correlation
with how effective they were in an

1264
01:15:51,871 --> 01:15:54,850
organization.
So it we started to do is we found,

1265
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:58,180
I looked back to the first
couple of people, I said, well,

1266
01:15:58,570 --> 01:16:01,870
I worked with these guys before we worked
together on the open source project

1267
01:16:02,290 --> 01:16:07,290
and so how can we sort of set up a hiring
system that where you actually do the

1268
01:16:07,991 --> 01:16:10,630
work that you're going to do in the job
and that's all you're judging them by.

1269
01:16:10,780 --> 01:16:12,790
You don't care about anything else.

1270
01:16:12,820 --> 01:16:16,150
And so we try to make the interview
process as much like the actual work as

1271
01:16:16,151 --> 01:16:18,460
possible so we don't do voice or video.

1272
01:16:18,790 --> 01:16:22,690
It's all text chat because that's how we
primarily communicate also prevents you

1273
01:16:22,691 --> 01:16:27,691
from any subconscious bias
getting romanced by whatever
voice or presentation of

1274
01:16:28,690 --> 01:16:30,250
the person might have. Yeah. Um,

1275
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:32,380
or maybe they have a funny
accent or something like that.

1276
01:16:32,650 --> 01:16:34,870
That doesn't matter in our company.
Um,

1277
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:38,890
unless maybe they're a salesperson
and their ability to convince you of

1278
01:16:38,891 --> 01:16:42,730
something or have a charisma
is important for their job. Um,

1279
01:16:43,420 --> 01:16:44,500
there's really no benefit.

1280
01:16:44,501 --> 01:16:48,700
So these in person or even
voice or video interactions.

1281
01:16:49,210 --> 01:16:53,080
So we, uh, we have a pretty
good system for this. Now.

1282
01:16:53,081 --> 01:16:54,280
We get a ton of applications.

1283
01:16:54,281 --> 01:16:58,920
I'm actually over a thousand
applications behind now. Okay.

1284
01:16:59,020 --> 01:17:02,590
How do you filter a thousand applications?
Uh, so I book in the process now.

1285
01:17:02,620 --> 01:17:05,860
So where we've evolved to is I
review all the incoming applications.

1286
01:17:06,250 --> 01:17:10,610
I do a first pass at them and
I pass them on to a team if it,

1287
01:17:11,090 --> 01:17:15,550
if they seem promising or
interesting to you look for a while.

1288
01:17:15,551 --> 01:17:16,384
I can't tell you everything.

1289
01:17:16,510 --> 01:17:19,840
Okay.
When you look for or disqualify against,

1290
01:17:21,210 --> 01:17:25,000
I look for passion,
attention to detail, um,

1291
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:29,850
drive beyond the things that they
need to do. You know, and I'm totally,

1292
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:31,920
I'm totally down with quirky,
you know,

1293
01:17:32,010 --> 01:17:36,480
what questions do you ask to
get an indication of those
things? So at this point,

1294
01:17:36,481 --> 01:17:40,530
all I'm doing is looking at emails. So
literally there's no chat, no anything.

1295
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:45,090
So it's purely based on the Karen
effort that they put into this email.

1296
01:17:45,330 --> 01:17:48,270
And we've tried forms and things they
fill out before and we've gone back to

1297
01:17:48,271 --> 01:17:51,690
just a free form email because I want
to see what kind of attachment that use

1298
01:17:52,020 --> 01:17:53,490
and want to see how their email client is.

1299
01:17:53,670 --> 01:17:56,670
I want to see if you can tell they've
copy and pasted things because different

1300
01:17:56,671 --> 01:17:58,050
texts, different font sizes, right?

1301
01:17:58,650 --> 01:18:03,030
So all of those are indicators and not
any one of them he's displaying textbooks.

1302
01:18:04,690 --> 01:18:08,760
Any one of those would not be a
Yay or nay, but the combination,

1303
01:18:08,761 --> 01:18:12,300
you get a pretty good sense. And then
I pass it onto a team. The team has,

1304
01:18:12,810 --> 01:18:17,040
for example, for engineering, they have a
system where everyone again looks at it,

1305
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:18,240
they kind of rate it,
uh,

1306
01:18:18,270 --> 01:18:20,310
they choose a certain number of
people would make it the next stage,

1307
01:18:20,311 --> 01:18:24,270
which is like a very simple code test,
takes about half an hour.

1308
01:18:24,750 --> 01:18:27,660
Sometimes it's called a
fizzbuzz test and programming.

1309
01:18:27,661 --> 01:18:28,560
And just what does that mean?

1310
01:18:29,380 --> 01:18:34,000
It just a basic super basic
thing that anyone was,

1311
01:18:34,550 --> 01:18:36,630
does it stand for something
that, yeah. So you,

1312
01:18:36,631 --> 01:18:38,430
you move some variables around that,

1313
01:18:38,431 --> 01:18:41,550
our fears and buzz and your range of
different ways or you repeat them or you

1314
01:18:41,790 --> 01:18:43,530
sorta array or something like that.

1315
01:18:43,531 --> 01:18:47,010
But it got it a basic thing that anyone
can figure out and that's filters out a

1316
01:18:47,011 --> 01:18:50,040
surprising number of people even who
make it through these first few screens,

1317
01:18:50,310 --> 01:18:55,020
simple coding tests, and then
they screw that up. I don't know.

1318
01:18:56,140 --> 01:18:59,650
Okay. All right. Fair enough.

1319
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:04,450
I had this application for this managing
editor position and I was astonished at

1320
01:19:04,451 --> 01:19:08,620
how people would go through
75% of the application.

1321
01:19:08,890 --> 01:19:12,850
This is a woof woof form. They'd get
to a question that asked, let's say,

1322
01:19:12,851 --> 01:19:15,490
you know how you would get
the rock to be on the podcast,

1323
01:19:15,491 --> 01:19:19,570
what would your process look like? And
they would say, now on second thought,

1324
01:19:19,571 --> 01:19:20,740
I'm not interested in this job.

1325
01:19:20,770 --> 01:19:25,360
And then they would go to the
bottom and still hit submit. Wow.

1326
01:19:25,450 --> 01:19:28,270
I was very puzzled by that.
Yeah.

1327
01:19:28,271 --> 01:19:30,850
There's a lot of odd behavior
and jot out a job application,

1328
01:19:30,851 --> 01:19:34,060
so I don't know if you know,
but I'm hiring a new executive assistant,

1329
01:19:34,061 --> 01:19:38,270
personal assistant, and I
referenced you're managing
editor, hiring post. Ah, I,

1330
01:19:38,650 --> 01:19:42,010
I blocked, quoted the section where you
say why it's terrible to work with you.

1331
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:46,420
Yeah. I think it's important.
I've tried to not disguise that,

1332
01:19:46,421 --> 01:19:49,000
but I haven't been super explicit
about it in the past. And I,

1333
01:19:49,001 --> 01:19:54,001
if I just need someone who finds that
Shackleton expedition type description

1334
01:19:54,850 --> 01:19:58,260
appealing as opposed to off pudding, you
know, someone who wants a perfectionist,

1335
01:19:58,270 --> 01:20:03,270
someone who wants to see someone who wants
a person like me to edit the hell out

1336
01:20:03,701 --> 01:20:08,040
of their work. Yeah. And uh, so I found
it very important, but so you have

1337
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:10,140
them go through a simple coding
test. I liked that, by the way.

1338
01:20:10,141 --> 01:20:13,920
I went to Antarctica last month in the
South Pole and so I've been reading the

1339
01:20:13,921 --> 01:20:17,790
Shackleton, I think it's the endurance
book. Yeah. It's such a fascinating story.

1340
01:20:17,791 --> 01:20:19,070
So fascinating. Yeah. The,

1341
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:23,610
for those people who don't know the
classified ad read something like seeking

1342
01:20:23,611 --> 01:20:28,110
men for dangerous journey,
return, uncertain glory,

1343
01:20:28,260 --> 01:20:31,770
glory upon success. Something
on hate, low pay. Hey,

1344
01:20:32,670 --> 01:20:36,930
harsh conditions. I had a friend who
jokes, she should make that her a Okcupid,

1345
01:20:40,070 --> 01:20:44,260
right? The Tinder description. Probably
get a lot of responses. Uh, the,

1346
01:20:44,470 --> 01:20:47,520
the code test and then what happens?
We'll do a trial project.

1347
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:50,070
So basically we don't actually,

1348
01:20:50,430 --> 01:20:52,860
we're not trying to get code out
of people or anything like that.

1349
01:20:52,861 --> 01:20:57,120
We just do something that looks like the
actual work and we're not just looking

1350
01:20:57,121 --> 01:21:01,500
at the code they produce, but how
they communicate, how they commit.

1351
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:05,580
And that's a paid project. Yeah. So
we put everyone on just a flat rate,

1352
01:21:05,581 --> 01:21:09,810
$25 per hour contract. Um, and from it,

1353
01:21:09,811 --> 01:21:11,520
most people who apply how jobs are ready.

1354
01:21:11,521 --> 01:21:13,300
So it's often a nights and weekends thing,
right.

1355
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:15,330
As long as the expectations are set,
that doesn't matter.

1356
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:19,560
If you could only work one hour a week,
that's okay. Just let us know. Um,

1357
01:21:19,561 --> 01:21:21,210
some people will actually
take vacation to do it,

1358
01:21:21,660 --> 01:21:24,780
so they'll take time off from their job
and you know, kind of go at it full time.

1359
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:27,960
Um, if you're applying for
happiness engineer position,

1360
01:21:27,990 --> 01:21:30,660
you'll answer tickets or
do live chats. So, um,

1361
01:21:30,780 --> 01:21:33,210
we try to replicate the real
position as much as possible.

1362
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:35,430
And then if they make it
through all of this, um,

1363
01:21:35,670 --> 01:21:39,290
they get sent back to me for a final
chat and that we'll do on slack. Now.

1364
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:41,710
He used to do it on Skype and I just um,

1365
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:44,670
go back and forth to them usually
like three or four hours actually.

1366
01:21:45,020 --> 01:21:47,100
But because you're typing
so it takes a little longer.

1367
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:52,700
And for that I try to
determine a cultural fit,

1368
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:57,930
um, really get to know the
person because I have a,

1369
01:21:58,950 --> 01:22:01,260
afterwards I like,
let's say we're hiring engineer,

1370
01:22:01,830 --> 01:22:05,750
before I send the offer letter, I decided
what team they go on. So kinda like the,

1371
01:22:05,810 --> 01:22:10,410
that's the thing where you put on a hat
in Harry Potter and it decides which, oh,

1372
01:22:10,470 --> 01:22:11,041
I don't know.

1373
01:22:11,041 --> 01:22:13,230
I know you're talking about it decides
which school you're going to. Yeah.

1374
01:22:13,231 --> 01:22:15,450
So by yeah, right. By talking to them,

1375
01:22:15,810 --> 01:22:18,420
I'm partly determining like which
team will they fit best with?

1376
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:21,900
Because the other 300 people in the
company I've done this with and so I know

1377
01:22:21,930 --> 01:22:24,450
what their strengths and weaknesses
are over their personalities are,

1378
01:22:24,451 --> 01:22:25,261
what time zones there.

1379
01:22:25,261 --> 01:22:28,170
And so really putting a lot of variables
into deciding where someone goes.

1380
01:22:28,290 --> 01:22:33,120
Are there any simple questions that give
you a particular amount of depth into

1381
01:22:33,121 --> 01:22:36,760
someone's personality? Yeah, I'm,

1382
01:22:36,780 --> 01:22:40,680
I'm constantly iterating the question
list and I'm happy to show it to you after

1383
01:22:40,681 --> 01:22:43,560
the vodcasts. But, um, every
interview is different.

1384
01:22:43,561 --> 01:22:47,610
I'm just almost every single one.
I try out something new or very it.

1385
01:22:47,670 --> 01:22:50,940
Or what is your spirit animal?
Um, what is your spirit animal?

1386
01:22:50,941 --> 01:22:55,170
I mean [inaudible]
you know,

1387
01:22:55,171 --> 01:22:56,550
it doesn't matter.
And you know,

1388
01:22:56,551 --> 01:23:00,450
some questions I retire and it's totally
different and it's not like a preset

1389
01:23:00,451 --> 01:23:01,141
script or anything.

1390
01:23:01,141 --> 01:23:05,030
Like sometimes things go one direction
and then just go with it. Um,

1391
01:23:05,140 --> 01:23:07,690
but at the end of it,
if decide to make an offer,

1392
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:11,350
we talk about compensation and
then I send out the letter.

1393
01:23:11,830 --> 01:23:15,610
What percentage of people fall
out in that last chat with you?

1394
01:23:16,390 --> 01:23:18,400
Falling out in the last
chat is pretty rare.

1395
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,890
Especially now that the
systems before it are so good.

1396
01:23:21,490 --> 01:23:24,040
So the hiring teams have gotten quite,
quite good at automatic.

1397
01:23:24,250 --> 01:23:26,920
It's tough because hiring is not
something that you get good at.

1398
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:30,760
And T we've done at five or 10 times
and you've seen people work out and not

1399
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:33,880
workout. So it's really just something
that you need experience. So I,

1400
01:23:34,060 --> 01:23:37,780
I tell people like when they go
in this new role, my, you know,

1401
01:23:38,890 --> 01:23:40,960
in the beginning here and make
some mistakes and that's okay,

1402
01:23:40,990 --> 01:23:44,090
we'll plan for that. Um, but then you
learn from that and your triangle it.

1403
01:23:44,620 --> 01:23:49,210
Do you have an opinion of top grading?
Do you know anything about top grading?

1404
01:23:49,870 --> 01:23:53,980
I find references completely useless.
So yeah,

1405
01:23:53,990 --> 01:23:55,510
including when you go outside,

1406
01:23:55,511 --> 01:23:58,510
what they give you as references and
you try to contact people. It just,

1407
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:00,340
I haven't found any,

1408
01:24:00,341 --> 01:24:04,990
it's takes a ton of time and I haven't
found any sort of correlation with the

1409
01:24:04,991 --> 01:24:06,040
ultimate quality of the person.

1410
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:09,540
So I heard about top grading and tried
it for a few months, wasn't worth it.

1411
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:12,400
It didn't work very well.
I have an article I can,

1412
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:16,450
we can go to the show notes and Harvard
Harvard Business Review where I wrote a

1413
01:24:16,510 --> 01:24:19,050
kind of five or 10 pages on this.
So that's the process.

1414
01:24:19,330 --> 01:24:20,470
I would love to include that at the,

1415
01:24:20,471 --> 01:24:24,950
I actually have that printed out because
of an old man and highlighted. Cool.

1416
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:28,000
Which is a weird thing I do. Sometimes
I'll print something out, take notes,

1417
01:24:28,001 --> 01:24:32,290
highlight, and then rescan it back
into Evernote to be OCR. Cool. Yeah.

1418
01:24:32,470 --> 01:24:36,520
Which uh, which I like a lot cause I think
better tactically. Is that a real word?

1419
01:24:36,550 --> 01:24:39,880
I think so. Uh, uh,

1420
01:24:41,140 --> 01:24:45,430
what is the book that you have
given as a gift most often

1421
01:24:47,710 --> 01:24:50,800
besides the year without pants, which
you can feel free to mention? Oh yeah,

1422
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:54,220
there is a book about
automatic and wordpress.com
called the hero without pants

1423
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:59,050
written by a great orthoscopic. And um,
it tells a story about how it work. Uh,

1424
01:24:59,080 --> 01:25:01,840
I give a lot of different books as
gifts because everyone's different.

1425
01:25:01,841 --> 01:25:06,670
So there's one by and apologize now
because I can't pronounce anything cause I

1426
01:25:06,671 --> 01:25:07,181
just read,

1427
01:25:07,181 --> 01:25:10,570
I don't actually talk that lunch while
you were pronouncing crayons is crowns

1428
01:25:10,571 --> 01:25:13,540
earlier, which round, which I thought
was amazing. I was like, crowns,

1429
01:25:13,541 --> 01:25:17,290
what are crowns? They eat?
I was like, oh, crayons.

1430
01:25:18,070 --> 01:25:21,910
Maybe it's a southern thing. I don't
know. But, um, now for example,

1431
01:25:21,911 --> 01:25:26,140
I've given a few times a book called how
Proust can change your life by Elaine.

1432
01:25:26,141 --> 01:25:30,550
Did baton field guide to getting lost
by Rebecca Solnit is one I've given.

1433
01:25:30,610 --> 01:25:34,660
That's cool. What does that about? Uh, I
don't know if I can summarize that one.

1434
01:25:34,661 --> 01:25:39,100
Actually getting lost. Yeah.
Um, there's Rebecca Solnit.

1435
01:25:39,130 --> 01:25:42,010
Why doesn't she look? Oh, actually
she is, that's what she's written.

1436
01:25:42,011 --> 01:25:46,990
She writes for New York or a little bit
everything. Um, the effective executive.

1437
01:25:47,380 --> 01:25:51,100
That's great. Well that's Peter Drucker
read anything by Peter Drucker. So good.

1438
01:25:51,170 --> 01:25:55,030
His goal. So good. So I recommend
that a lot in the company, uh,

1439
01:25:55,031 --> 01:25:58,870
words that work by Frank Luntz. I did.
I read that on your recommendation. Oh,

1440
01:25:58,871 --> 01:26:02,290
did you like it? I did, yeah.
How would you describe that?

1441
01:26:02,291 --> 01:26:07,040
Let's say former
or Carl or has current,

1442
01:26:07,460 --> 01:26:10,750
yeah, he's like the, the linguistic
head of the Republican party,

1443
01:26:10,940 --> 01:26:13,460
right. So inheritance tax, death tax,

1444
01:26:13,850 --> 01:26:17,990
or controlling the labels of conversation
and understanding of what language

1445
01:26:17,991 --> 01:26:19,310
works well for certain purposes.

1446
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:22,770
Really fascinating. So, and depending
on how, if someone likes that book,

1447
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:24,390
I liked that book,

1448
01:26:24,690 --> 01:26:28,770
then I might point them to George Lake
off like he has a great seminal work from

1449
01:26:28,771 --> 01:26:33,360
the 70s called woman fire and dangerous
things or just other books about framing

1450
01:26:33,361 --> 01:26:36,120
and language. Um, so there's, you know,

1451
01:26:36,121 --> 01:26:38,910
there's a book for every purpose
and I find myself finding new ones.

1452
01:26:38,911 --> 01:26:40,890
So for example, last year I just
started reading fiction again.

1453
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:44,640
I hadn't read fiction for about 15 years.
I did the same thing.

1454
01:26:44,670 --> 01:26:46,280
What did and any favorites so far y'all?

1455
01:26:46,290 --> 01:26:49,940
I didn't read fiction for probably 15
to 20 years and is one called the hard

1456
01:26:49,941 --> 01:26:52,870
boiled wonderland at the end of
the universe. Work Hubby. Yeah,

1457
01:26:52,980 --> 01:26:56,910
I really liked the quirky one and he
has a lot of jazz references and things.

1458
01:26:56,911 --> 01:27:00,270
I like the majors. I
have not read. It was a,

1459
01:27:00,271 --> 01:27:03,540
it was a really good one and I'm working
through a few different ones now.

1460
01:27:03,541 --> 01:27:07,380
Like Shanti Rom and the untethered soul.

1461
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:09,990
I've just been trying to carve
out more time for reading.

1462
01:27:10,620 --> 01:27:13,890
The kindle is the device that even
if I don't use it for a month or two,

1463
01:27:13,891 --> 01:27:18,891
I'll still keep in my pack and
just because it's aspirational.

1464
01:27:19,020 --> 01:27:21,840
But when I can get in a good flow,
I'll read a little bit every day,

1465
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:26,580
sometimes first thing in the morning. And
that's, uh, just my whole life is better.

1466
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:28,830
Well, you're the one who
convinced me to get a kindle.

1467
01:27:28,860 --> 01:27:31,980
I don't know if you remember, we've gone,
we've got a number of trips together.

1468
01:27:32,070 --> 01:27:37,070
Thelma and Louise Style and attended
WordCamps in Greece and Turkey and uh,

1469
01:27:38,460 --> 01:27:41,190
well Vietnam was a trip for room to read,
which is a great organization.

1470
01:27:41,550 --> 01:27:46,550
But I remember in Greece had this
backpack full of 14 books and I was just

1471
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:53,400
popping my, you know, my, my discs in
my spine lugging this damn thing around.

1472
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:56,190
And you had your tiny little
kindle touch and you're like,

1473
01:27:56,280 --> 01:27:58,920
how's that working out for
you? It's like, it's terrible.

1474
01:27:59,310 --> 01:28:01,350
Although what you would
do when we were waiting,

1475
01:28:01,351 --> 01:28:04,350
because you would actually lift it like
a weights. That's true. That's true.

1476
01:28:04,351 --> 01:28:07,800
I use my backpack. Uh, I have
a, I have a hemp backpack.

1477
01:28:07,801 --> 01:28:12,120
That's reinforced that I can use
for exercises and swings and stuff.

1478
01:28:12,121 --> 01:28:14,040
I remember Kevin Rose
once when we were in,

1479
01:28:14,130 --> 01:28:19,130
we went to China on a trip for tea
tasting and I would wake up in the morning

1480
01:28:20,340 --> 01:28:22,590
and I would do exercises.
It was so hot there.

1481
01:28:22,860 --> 01:28:26,300
I would do exercises with
this backpack in my, you know,

1482
01:28:26,340 --> 01:28:28,810
tidy whities like expos,
you underwear.

1483
01:28:29,590 --> 01:28:34,520
Kevin took a video of me doing upright
rows in my underwear, which uh,

1484
01:28:34,540 --> 01:28:36,480
I had to confiscate and delete,
thankfully,

1485
01:28:36,930 --> 01:28:39,390
although I don't think it
would do anything bad to my
reputation because I don't

1486
01:28:39,391 --> 01:28:41,490
have one to protect at this point.

1487
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:43,660
I think if you looked at a side by side,

1488
01:28:43,690 --> 01:28:47,140
you have the backpack full of book
muscles and I have the kindle muscle.

1489
01:28:49,010 --> 01:28:51,770
That's true. Although
to your credit, uh, you,

1490
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:56,550
you did get into a physical
fitness and kettle bells and so on.

1491
01:28:56,880 --> 01:29:01,470
How's that a, has that, has that continued
or is that, is that paused the moment

1492
01:29:02,310 --> 01:29:05,820
it has continued pretty well. Look,
can you look leaner than the usual?

1493
01:29:06,150 --> 01:29:08,880
I shouldn't say the usual.
That's not fair. Then puffy mat,

1494
01:29:09,180 --> 01:29:12,210
and there's a puffy Tim too, but I
haven't seen you puffy in quite a while.

1495
01:29:12,660 --> 01:29:15,870
So the thing that I started
doing just most recently,

1496
01:29:15,871 --> 01:29:19,920
this most recent summer was running
and it's kind of randomly like I was in

1497
01:29:19,921 --> 01:29:23,190
Italy. It was really pretty. I thought,
now let me try going for a run.

1498
01:29:24,090 --> 01:29:27,900
And it killed me. Like I barely made it
like half a mile before I had a walk.

1499
01:29:27,940 --> 01:29:30,060
And then it just kind
of started building it.

1500
01:29:30,061 --> 01:29:31,850
I think my next one was
like a month later I get,

1501
01:29:31,851 --> 01:29:35,340
it wasn't like I was instantly
attached, but this, um,

1502
01:29:35,341 --> 01:29:36,180
there's a guy in the company,

1503
01:29:36,850 --> 01:29:40,910
he calls himself the crazy
running guy and he let him,

1504
01:29:41,010 --> 01:29:45,930
who's this joy Joe Boyd sting
and he actually, or boats,
boat boats then, sorry,

1505
01:29:46,350 --> 01:29:47,640
sorry, job. Um,

1506
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:51,330
he started doing this thing where he'd
land at the airport and then run to the

1507
01:29:51,331 --> 01:29:54,330
word camp from the airport.
So 20,

1508
01:29:54,331 --> 01:29:59,100
30 for our grand meetup in Utah,
he ran from Salt Lake City to park city.

1509
01:29:59,700 --> 01:30:03,970
It was I think 50 or 60 miles.
That's insane. And so, uh,

1510
01:30:03,971 --> 01:30:05,880
at our grand meetup this year,
which was in park city,

1511
01:30:06,060 --> 01:30:07,740
he ran little running
workshops every morning.

1512
01:30:07,741 --> 01:30:10,650
And so I went out with him and he
was like, Hey, don't focus on speed.

1513
01:30:11,080 --> 01:30:13,470
Tried to do 180 strides per minute.
So smaller steps,

1514
01:30:13,471 --> 01:30:15,780
even if you're on slower
focus on your heart rate,

1515
01:30:15,781 --> 01:30:16,980
like all these sort of different things.

1516
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:20,970
And it completely transformed me where
before I had my legs would always be

1517
01:30:20,971 --> 01:30:24,450
really sore, like my whole body would her
and after I ran, even though I loved it,

1518
01:30:24,451 --> 01:30:26,280
like I was just in too much pain,

1519
01:30:26,940 --> 01:30:30,090
I just slowed down and then start
being able to go much further.

1520
01:30:30,870 --> 01:30:33,120
There's really interesting
guy named Doctor Romanov.

1521
01:30:33,210 --> 01:30:35,720
I don't know if you've ever
come across the stage. He,

1522
01:30:36,230 --> 01:30:41,230
he founded a method of running called
the pose method and talks a lot about the

1523
01:30:41,281 --> 01:30:45,900
forward lean and using gravity to
assist your money is your money.

1524
01:30:46,410 --> 01:30:47,070
You could use gravity.

1525
01:30:47,070 --> 01:30:50,370
If I could figure that out then I Mesic
gravity do assist you're running as

1526
01:30:50,371 --> 01:30:55,350
opposed to heel striking and pushing.
And,

1527
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:59,760
uh, there are some really
fascinating videos of him
running on ice, for instance,

1528
01:30:59,820 --> 01:31:03,270
by using that forward lean. Very,
very cool stuff. So you might enjoy,

1529
01:31:03,420 --> 01:31:05,550
I started with the vibrams.
Yeah,

1530
01:31:06,060 --> 01:31:08,760
I switched to just some super
thin trail running shoes,

1531
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:12,510
but I still run more on the
front or middle of my foot. Yeah,

1532
01:31:12,511 --> 01:31:14,490
you have to be careful with the
minimalist shoes. You can really,

1533
01:31:14,491 --> 01:31:18,090
if you get too aggressive in the
beginning, particularly since the,

1534
01:31:18,120 --> 01:31:22,860
it's not just the impact on the soft
tissues of the foot and the connective

1535
01:31:22,861 --> 01:31:26,100
tissues. Most people who
have walked with an elevated,

1536
01:31:26,101 --> 01:31:28,230
he'll even an inch for
a long period of time,

1537
01:31:28,231 --> 01:31:31,020
have a chronically
shortened Achilles tendon.

1538
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:34,830
So suddenly when you stand flat footed
and you're leaning forward on top of that

1539
01:31:35,370 --> 01:31:39,720
to run, you can cause Achilles
tendon tendinitis or tendinosis,

1540
01:31:39,721 --> 01:31:42,780
which is really painful. Really bad. Yeah,
I've done that before. And it's true.

1541
01:31:42,781 --> 01:31:46,500
Like for awhile, my right Achilles
was kind of sore, but I had a friend,

1542
01:31:46,501 --> 01:31:49,530
we were training up for a half marathon
together and he ended up really injuring

1543
01:31:49,531 --> 01:31:51,180
his feet,
which is tough because he's a fireman.

1544
01:31:51,181 --> 01:31:55,080
So is that my best friend in
Houston, Renee? So the, um,

1545
01:31:55,680 --> 01:31:57,300
he ended up,
you gotta be careful with this.

1546
01:31:57,301 --> 01:32:00,190
So I know you're not a huge fan of running

1547
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:04,780
and that's high impact and it's a, it's
not that I'm, it's not that I'm not a fan,

1548
01:32:04,781 --> 01:32:05,890
it's that,
uh,

1549
01:32:09,150 --> 01:32:14,150
I choose my exercise based on my
objectives and thus far I have not found

1550
01:32:16,020 --> 01:32:20,010
running to stack up favorably compared
to other things. I could say that. Yeah.

1551
01:32:20,130 --> 01:32:25,130
And I think that it running is much
easier to justify as a moving meditation.

1552
01:32:27,010 --> 01:32:29,490
Uh,
and certainly it's fantastic for travel,

1553
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:33,540
but that's why I have my bag that
I can use as a weight. Also. Uh,

1554
01:32:33,610 --> 01:32:35,250
I would like to get better at running,

1555
01:32:35,251 --> 01:32:37,200
do the Lyme disease and
everything that I've dealt with.

1556
01:32:37,201 --> 01:32:40,530
I have partial tears in both acs,
both elbows and both hips.

1557
01:32:40,830 --> 01:32:44,430
So I'm going to have to work up to any
type of impact. So I'll start with,

1558
01:32:44,460 --> 01:32:45,630
I'll start with,
uh,

1559
01:32:46,830 --> 01:32:51,830
some of the calisthenics I'm doing now
and then graduate to a low impact jumping

1560
01:32:53,431 --> 01:32:57,270
rope oh yeah. To, to really condition
the lower legs in particular.

1561
01:32:57,720 --> 01:33:02,460
And then, um, I'm doing long walks, also
his way wave of, of conditioning the feet.

1562
01:33:02,610 --> 01:33:06,810
So I'll do two to three hour walks
very routinely and make phone calls,

1563
01:33:07,140 --> 01:33:10,800
batch my phone calls my I love when
I'm in a new city and I can do a run.

1564
01:33:10,830 --> 01:33:13,170
It's a great way to see a city.
Oh definitely.

1565
01:33:13,200 --> 01:33:14,820
Because you're at just the right speed.

1566
01:33:14,821 --> 01:33:18,450
I did one in Washington DC we could
tear ago and he's just so cool.

1567
01:33:18,451 --> 01:33:20,070
I felt like I was on an episode of House,
a car.

1568
01:33:20,071 --> 01:33:23,340
It's like I'm going back to Washington
monuments and like the Lincoln memorial

1569
01:33:23,341 --> 01:33:25,380
and like running around the mall.
It was so cool.

1570
01:33:25,410 --> 01:33:26,460
That's what Bruce Lee used to do.

1571
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:28,920
You just traveled with his running shoes
and when he first landed he would go

1572
01:33:28,921 --> 01:33:31,170
for an orientation run.
Nice.

1573
01:33:31,260 --> 01:33:36,260
So one of the first things I do in lieu
of the jog or running is a bike tours.

1574
01:33:37,770 --> 01:33:41,280
So I'll do sort of cruiser bike tours
in any new city that I want to get

1575
01:33:41,281 --> 01:33:42,720
acquainted with.
Uh,

1576
01:33:43,260 --> 01:33:48,210
I would love to ask a couple of
questions that came in through Twitter

1577
01:33:48,240 --> 01:33:52,140
specifically. Uh, I am at t
Ferriss. Two R's, two s's.

1578
01:33:52,141 --> 01:33:56,790
You are at photo p h o
t o m. A t. T also upon,

1579
01:33:57,320 --> 01:34:00,420
yeah. Remember you used, Oh,

1580
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:04,660
I never noticed that. Wow.
You just realize that.

1581
01:34:04,661 --> 01:34:08,710
I just noticed that you are,
I forgot you're the pun master.

1582
01:34:09,220 --> 01:34:12,730
And in Japanese they call
those. Oh yeah. IGETC Yoga,

1583
01:34:12,740 --> 01:34:17,650
which is dad jokes Yad gags.
And you do puns all the time.

1584
01:34:17,651 --> 01:34:21,750
You have as long as I've known you. Okay.
I should have known. All right. Photo Mat.

1585
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:26,140
That makes perfect sense. So
we've covered some of these, uh,

1586
01:34:26,141 --> 01:34:30,980
Joe Pella Koski acts, asked about how
you, uh, acquired developers. We are,

1587
01:34:30,990 --> 01:34:35,910
we already talked about that.
Uh, this is from Andy Von A.

1588
01:34:36,220 --> 01:34:40,660
Would you still bootstrap versus
taking angel money, seed money,

1589
01:34:40,900 --> 01:34:44,710
a software tool like wordpress if
you were starting over in 2015,

1590
01:34:45,640 --> 01:34:48,280
why or why not?
That's an interesting question.

1591
01:34:48,281 --> 01:34:50,860
I'm not sure if he thinks we're totally
bootstrapped or that we've raised money.

1592
01:34:51,310 --> 01:34:56,000
So the, I'll say what we did
and what I would do again. Um,

1593
01:34:56,540 --> 01:34:58,010
we bootstrapped

1594
01:34:58,010 --> 01:35:00,560
for the first few months and then
I raised about a million dollars.

1595
01:35:00,860 --> 01:35:05,120
This was automatic. This is automatic.
Yeah. Wordpress is a whole separate nd.

1596
01:35:05,590 --> 01:35:05,960
Um,

1597
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:10,960
so for automatically raises about a
million dollars in 2006 and that was in

1598
01:35:12,141 --> 01:35:13,190
hindsight,
we didn't need it,

1599
01:35:13,580 --> 01:35:18,580
but I'm glad we did it because I felt
responsible for these other lives.

1600
01:35:18,680 --> 01:35:18,921
You know,

1601
01:35:18,921 --> 01:35:23,150
the other people who were sort of betting
on joining this company that was run

1602
01:35:23,151 --> 01:35:27,630
by like a 20 year old. And um,
so I want to have some certain,

1603
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:30,500
I want to have some money in the bank
that said even if things went to zero,

1604
01:35:30,740 --> 01:35:32,150
we all have a job for at least a year.

1605
01:35:32,300 --> 01:35:37,190
So that's why we raised that first money
2008 we had an acquisition offer for

1606
01:35:37,191 --> 01:35:40,790
north of $200 million, even though we
were just, I think 18 people at the time.

1607
01:35:41,510 --> 01:35:46,510
And so use that to turn into a round and
did about 12 million a primary capital

1608
01:35:46,641 --> 01:35:50,420
there. And then we didn't raise
money again until last year, 2014.

1609
01:35:50,930 --> 01:35:52,400
So I was pretty anti raising money.

1610
01:35:53,060 --> 01:35:55,310
As you can imagine for the six years that
we didn't do it. How much should you,

1611
01:35:55,370 --> 01:35:58,850
is it public health she raised last
year or is 160 million? That's a,

1612
01:35:58,870 --> 01:36:03,560
that's a big number. It is the valuation
public. Uh, it was over $1 billion. Yeah.

1613
01:36:04,010 --> 01:36:08,180
It's also big number, even
bigger number. Uh, if you were,

1614
01:36:08,240 --> 01:36:11,150
if you were starting over
again developing wordpress,

1615
01:36:11,151 --> 01:36:15,920
would you make a for profit entity
like wordpress.com or automatic sooner?

1616
01:36:17,660 --> 01:36:21,440
Um, so it wasn't a matter
of nonprofit and for profit,

1617
01:36:21,441 --> 01:36:24,110
it was just a matter of
not even thinking about it.

1618
01:36:24,111 --> 01:36:27,920
Loose amalgamation of random
people working together
and then a for profit that

1619
01:36:27,921 --> 01:36:31,580
came later. Nonprofits, I'm not as
much of a fan of his, I used to be,

1620
01:36:31,880 --> 01:36:33,440
wordpress does have a
wordpress foundation.

1621
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:37,670
Just the rules around them are mostly
designed to prevent people from cheating

1622
01:36:37,671 --> 01:36:41,320
on their taxes, which we don't care about.
And they restrict what you can meet.

1623
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:46,690
Yes. Meaning we paid taxes
to the cows go home. Right?

1624
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:53,080
So those rules to prevent abuse end up
constricting the good and organization.

1625
01:36:53,181 --> 01:36:54,230
Can do a lot of ways.

1626
01:36:54,680 --> 01:36:58,600
So I don't think I would start another
nonprofit in terms of raising money when

1627
01:36:58,620 --> 01:36:58,811
things,

1628
01:36:58,811 --> 01:37:03,440
it became very clear to me once I became
CEO is the opportunity costs of being

1629
01:37:03,441 --> 01:37:07,910
as lean and sort of break managing
the company to break even as we were,

1630
01:37:08,360 --> 01:37:11,270
we can do big acquisitions.
We couldn't invest in infrastructure,

1631
01:37:11,271 --> 01:37:15,410
we couldn't do a lot of things that make
a lot of sense. Now. Like for example,

1632
01:37:15,411 --> 01:37:18,950
since we raise money, we're building
at a 11 data centers worldwide.

1633
01:37:19,460 --> 01:37:21,110
So for worldwide he's is a wordpress.

1634
01:37:21,111 --> 01:37:24,050
It's going to start getting a lot
faster because we'll be closer to you

1635
01:37:24,051 --> 01:37:25,400
physically.
Um,

1636
01:37:25,700 --> 01:37:29,960
I was [inaudible] that we would have
considered before and we're doing now, so.

1637
01:37:30,410 --> 01:37:32,060
Got It. I would, you know,

1638
01:37:32,061 --> 01:37:37,061
if you can set expectations correctly
with investors and raise money on terms

1639
01:37:37,730 --> 01:37:42,620
that allow you to stay true to your
principles and remain in control of the

1640
01:37:42,621 --> 01:37:46,960
things that you want to be in control
of. I think it can be, you know,

1641
01:37:46,970 --> 01:37:48,600
I would highly recommend it.
Um,

1642
01:37:48,770 --> 01:37:50,960
but there's shared expectations
are really important.

1643
01:37:51,560 --> 01:37:56,160
So I think that would be an expectation
that's important to you. Um,

1644
01:37:56,190 --> 01:37:58,590
an expectation that we're
not going to IPO this year,

1645
01:37:58,591 --> 01:38:01,430
next year or the year after that. Like
it's not a priority of ours. Got It.

1646
01:38:01,500 --> 01:38:05,780
Just time, just agreeing on the timeline
and example for us would be, um,

1647
01:38:06,300 --> 01:38:09,320
that we don't monetize
step back. So, you know,

1648
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:11,760
can you explain for people
what jetpack is? Oh, sure.

1649
01:38:11,761 --> 01:38:13,620
So jet pack is a plugin for wordpress,

1650
01:38:13,621 --> 01:38:16,650
so it gives you all the
best of the cloud services,

1651
01:38:16,651 --> 01:38:21,090
a wordpress.com things that like resize
and optimize your images for whatever

1652
01:38:21,091 --> 01:38:23,790
client is visiting, whether
on mobile or desktop, um,

1653
01:38:23,850 --> 01:38:27,780
things that auto posts your
blog post to Twitter, Facebook,

1654
01:38:28,380 --> 01:38:32,190
Pinterest path everywhere.
Um, stats, you know,

1655
01:38:32,191 --> 01:38:34,980
this is all the things built into jetpack.
Um,

1656
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:38,640
that for us is really about
getting more users of wordpress.

1657
01:38:38,760 --> 01:38:40,890
It's not about charging
for some of those features.

1658
01:38:40,891 --> 01:38:43,260
And now jetpack has huge amounts of usage.

1659
01:38:43,320 --> 01:38:46,680
It reaches a very influential audience
and investor looking at the company might

1660
01:38:46,681 --> 01:38:49,530
say, Ah, if he's Charles like a little
bit of money for this jet pack thing,

1661
01:38:49,531 --> 01:38:50,790
you'd make hundreds of
millions of dollars,

1662
01:38:50,791 --> 01:38:54,480
but we need to be on the same page that
that's not something that we're planning

1663
01:38:54,481 --> 01:38:57,420
on. And so let's do it. You
have the optional, the same.

1664
01:38:58,260 --> 01:39:00,840
It's always good to have an option,
but for me,

1665
01:39:00,841 --> 01:39:03,800
the thing that's been messaged as being
super transparent and super upfront,

1666
01:39:04,300 --> 01:39:06,390
and I think it's true of
relationships of anything.

1667
01:39:06,391 --> 01:39:09,090
Like if you can set your
expectations with your investors,

1668
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:14,190
that's what they appreciate and um,
it, you invest in a lot of things.

1669
01:39:14,190 --> 01:39:17,220
I invested a lot of things at automatic.
Yeah.

1670
01:39:17,550 --> 01:39:19,470
I haven't Jummah which I'm honored to be.

1671
01:39:19,950 --> 01:39:22,200
It's been really fantastically fun so far.

1672
01:39:22,920 --> 01:39:27,450
There's an asymmetry to what you do
because you will hear maybe hundreds of

1673
01:39:27,451 --> 01:39:30,060
pitches for every company
that you have invested in.

1674
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:33,870
So I find the smartest guys in the world,
when you get to the very top echelon,

1675
01:39:34,260 --> 01:39:38,700
they have perfect bs detectors.
Yeah. It's much better to say,

1676
01:39:38,701 --> 01:39:39,534
I don't know.

1677
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:41,850
Then they try to make up an answer
to something you don't actually know.

1678
01:39:41,910 --> 01:39:46,230
So we'll just kind of refreshing actually
that just honesty and transparency is

1679
01:39:46,260 --> 01:39:50,700
actually, even when you're raising at
north of $1 billion is the best policy.

1680
01:39:51,090 --> 01:39:53,850
Yeah.
Such a fascinating landscape.

1681
01:39:55,050 --> 01:39:59,910
This is a question from Chris Saka ask
Matt if he will take you shopping for a

1682
01:39:59,911 --> 01:40:02,560
bad ass suit. I guess I
should say a bad butts. Who?

1683
01:40:03,240 --> 01:40:05,190
It's funny cause I actually say bad ass.

1684
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:07,920
I just didn't because you
did this whole setup so

1685
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:13,980
I was trying to set expectations
if you,

1686
01:40:14,130 --> 01:40:18,030
I mean you have some pretty good suits.
I've seen. I do, I have some suits but um,

1687
01:40:18,090 --> 01:40:22,440
I like suits because it removes all the
decision making. I don't like matching.

1688
01:40:23,460 --> 01:40:27,840
I don't like picking out outfits that
will match, which is why I like suits.

1689
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:32,400
It's either tee shirt and jeans or
suit.

1690
01:40:32,460 --> 01:40:37,320
I do very little in between.
If you're going to go for a
suit, Tom Ford, Tom Ford,

1691
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:40,890
the way to go. They're pretty
amazing. Any particular soup now? No.

1692
01:40:40,891 --> 01:40:43,770
Go into the store. They'll set you up
and your body types different to mine.

1693
01:40:43,771 --> 01:40:46,380
They'll, they'll find something that
makes you look great, but they, they,

1694
01:40:46,381 --> 01:40:49,840
they're cut as much younger
and much slimmer, a much, um,

1695
01:40:50,580 --> 01:40:51,690
more shaped in a way.

1696
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:55,600
I love Catone or Loro Piana
or like different folks,

1697
01:40:55,601 --> 01:41:00,460
but they tend to be made for older men
to be honest. So I lived their materials,

1698
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:03,280
but I ended up tailoring
them and re cutting them.

1699
01:41:03,310 --> 01:41:07,270
How did you get into clothing and fashion?
Because it wasn't always this way?

1700
01:41:08,490 --> 01:41:10,750
Um,
I have no idea.

1701
01:41:10,751 --> 01:41:15,751
It might've been the influence of my
good friend Ome on MOLEC and know he,

1702
01:41:16,780 --> 01:41:20,470
he appreciates the finer things in life
and I think that for who created giggle

1703
01:41:20,471 --> 01:41:22,090
and for people who don't
know, yeah, go home.

1704
01:41:22,091 --> 01:41:25,840
He's a journalist now VC at true
ventures. Um, and one of my best friends,

1705
01:41:25,841 --> 01:41:30,250
one of the first users of wordpress too.
I think that of course in anything,

1706
01:41:30,340 --> 01:41:32,420
like if we're talking about Tequilas,
if we're talking about class,

1707
01:41:32,421 --> 01:41:34,050
where if we're talking about microphones,

1708
01:41:34,060 --> 01:41:38,230
like there is as a spectrum and
you can go deep on any topic.

1709
01:41:38,680 --> 01:41:41,470
And I find it fascinating, you
know, when he meets someone,

1710
01:41:42,850 --> 01:41:44,260
that's one thing I always keep in mind,

1711
01:41:44,261 --> 01:41:47,860
like everyone is interesting if
you're ever bored in a conversation,

1712
01:41:47,980 --> 01:41:50,770
the problems with you and not with
the other person because 100% agreed.

1713
01:41:51,190 --> 01:41:53,410
That's what any good journalists
will tell you also. Yeah,

1714
01:41:53,590 --> 01:41:55,670
it's just all about figuring
out what someone's really into,

1715
01:41:55,710 --> 01:41:58,510
what they're passionate about, and then
when you find those passions, it's just,

1716
01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:02,560
I find it fascinating that like go deep
on chicken raising or whatever it is.

1717
01:42:03,490 --> 01:42:05,590
So on purchases,

1718
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:10,920
what is the last hundred dollars or less
purchase that you made that had a very

1719
01:42:11,591 --> 01:42:12,970
positive impact on your life

1720
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:17,290
are the first thing that comes
to mind is quite embarrassing.

1721
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:21,160
The gimp suit. No, I'm just kidding.

1722
01:42:21,370 --> 01:42:26,370
I used to make so much fun of like Marin
moms who were a Lulu Lemon all day,

1723
01:42:27,180 --> 01:42:30,210
but since I started running and
working out more, she's out.

1724
01:42:30,240 --> 01:42:34,290
Lulu lemon is freaking awesome,
like really great stuff.

1725
01:42:34,330 --> 01:42:36,650
Now it's kind of expensive.
Like it's definitely what this,

1726
01:42:36,740 --> 01:42:39,430
it's like shopping at whole foods where
you walk out in the check and I'm like

1727
01:42:39,431 --> 01:42:43,700
Whoa, how did that happen? About like two
tee shirts and some sweatpants. But um,

1728
01:42:44,180 --> 01:42:47,470
super high quality. I love how the
tax tear out so there's no tags allow.

1729
01:42:47,490 --> 01:42:51,970
The shorts are reversible and I found
especially as a travel constantly some of

1730
01:42:51,971 --> 01:42:56,890
these sort of long sleeve material
shorts will be super sharp, super soft,

1731
01:42:56,891 --> 01:43:01,180
super warm. I can run them, I can
sleep in them, I can do whatever the,

1732
01:43:01,181 --> 01:43:03,520
speaking of packing,
I will link to this in the show notes,

1733
01:43:03,521 --> 01:43:08,521
but you recently put up a post about what
you have in your carry on bag and that

1734
01:43:09,041 --> 01:43:12,160
is a genius carry on bag.
I shouldn't say that.

1735
01:43:12,161 --> 01:43:16,690
Maybe since I haven't seen the article
yet, but based on previous experience,

1736
01:43:17,050 --> 01:43:18,100
you're very methodical.

1737
01:43:18,700 --> 01:43:22,610
What's the one thing people can do one
or two things with carry on luggage that

1738
01:43:22,611 --> 01:43:23,920
will make the biggest
difference in your opinion?

1739
01:43:23,970 --> 01:43:27,250
It's supposed to about my backpack.
So it's about the things that, I mean,

1740
01:43:27,251 --> 01:43:30,820
I brought my backpack here, I carry
my backpack almost constantly. Um,

1741
01:43:31,150 --> 01:43:36,150
especially being what type of backpack
is up ads that is a very Indiana Jones.

1742
01:43:36,220 --> 01:43:37,041
I thank you.
It's,

1743
01:43:37,041 --> 01:43:40,440
it's from a company called hard graft
and linked to it in the most, um,

1744
01:43:41,050 --> 01:43:44,050
it's leather. They, it's, it's a
little pricey but it's really good.

1745
01:43:44,080 --> 01:43:46,540
I'll keep that for the next decade.
Um,

1746
01:43:47,440 --> 01:43:52,340
so because I can work from anywhere,
I have to work from everywhere.

1747
01:43:52,370 --> 01:43:53,630
That's the downside.
Yes.

1748
01:43:53,690 --> 01:43:56,210
And you never know when an emergency
he's going to pop up or anything.

1749
01:43:56,210 --> 01:44:01,210
So I tend to have within sort
of a 10 to 15 minute radius,

1750
01:44:01,790 --> 01:44:04,310
um, the tools I need to be
productive anyplace in the world,

1751
01:44:04,580 --> 01:44:07,100
including if I'm an Antarctica,
that might be a satellite phone.

1752
01:44:07,130 --> 01:44:11,600
If I'm in a different country,
maybe that's a local Myfi card or,

1753
01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:16,160
um, and so I'm just constantly bringing
things in and out. I was hesitant to,

1754
01:44:16,180 --> 01:44:19,310
to do a post about it. You asked me to
do a post about this years ago. I did.

1755
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:21,350
And I kept putting it off
because it kept changing.

1756
01:44:21,630 --> 01:44:24,110
So every time I'd start I'd like to take
a picture of my bag and then it would

1757
01:44:24,111 --> 01:44:27,740
change. By the time I wanted to email.
You still use, I think it's cold.

1758
01:44:29,290 --> 01:44:33,740
Oh, this is, I have one right
here. This is since I am packing.

1759
01:44:34,330 --> 01:44:38,900
Uh, well this is gritted technology
by cocoon. You still use this? Oh Wow.

1760
01:44:39,890 --> 01:44:41,300
Yeah.
I use a big grid it,

1761
01:44:41,330 --> 01:44:45,350
but this is a company called cocoon
for you people who can't see with

1762
01:44:45,351 --> 01:44:48,680
clairvoyance. What we're
looking at. It is a,

1763
01:44:49,160 --> 01:44:53,860
it's basically a sheet. Mine is
about five inches by 10 inches. Uh,

1764
01:44:54,030 --> 01:44:55,670
mine's eight by 10 I think.
Yeah,

1765
01:44:55,671 --> 01:45:00,671
your zip by 10 and it's a perpendicular
straps of elastic that you can stick

1766
01:45:02,780 --> 01:45:05,030
cables into iPhones,
into batteries,

1767
01:45:05,031 --> 01:45:09,320
into chapstick into as opposed to just
having a big mess of stuff in 15 pockets.

1768
01:45:10,220 --> 01:45:13,280
I find my stuff always falls out.

1769
01:45:13,340 --> 01:45:15,320
Like I just pulled it out
and it was like half empty.

1770
01:45:15,560 --> 01:45:17,420
So things are constantly
falling out of it.

1771
01:45:17,421 --> 01:45:20,480
I don't know if the way I walk or
whatever, but I always put it back in.

1772
01:45:20,840 --> 01:45:25,730
So the key for me, I used to lose
things all the time. In fact,

1773
01:45:25,731 --> 01:45:28,610
at one point I would lose
my keys so much. Um, I've,

1774
01:45:28,640 --> 01:45:31,910
I still have an old car so it has a
different door, key and ignition key.

1775
01:45:32,240 --> 01:45:37,240
So I made literally 15 copies of my Dorky
and I wrote photo mat on it and then I

1776
01:45:37,821 --> 01:45:40,910
gave it to all my friends.
And even like some random people I meet,

1777
01:45:40,911 --> 01:45:41,810
like instead of a business card,

1778
01:45:41,811 --> 01:45:45,200
I just give them a key to my
car with the idea of being,

1779
01:45:45,850 --> 01:45:47,840
you have as when I lost my keys.

1780
01:45:47,841 --> 01:45:50,400
So one would have the ability or
when I locked my keys in the car,

1781
01:45:51,530 --> 01:45:55,880
we need to teach you how to had a, had
a Jimmy your door. We need to get you,

1782
01:45:55,910 --> 01:46:00,380
we need to get you some, uh,
some locksmith keys. I'm not
sure if that's legal. So,

1783
01:46:00,790 --> 01:46:05,690
uh, with it within the
boundaries of legality in your
state or jurisdiction. Uh,

1784
01:46:06,470 --> 01:46:06,921
but yeah,

1785
01:46:06,921 --> 01:46:11,921
so I find that now I have
places where everything goes.

1786
01:46:12,650 --> 01:46:16,880
So my mouse for example, always goes in
the right front pocket of my backpack.

1787
01:46:17,270 --> 01:46:20,900
And if any time something's not that,
like I keep a bowl by my front door.

1788
01:46:21,030 --> 01:46:23,660
The is always going there.
You said that it was a bowl,

1789
01:46:23,720 --> 01:46:25,440
a bowl right by the front door.
Um,

1790
01:46:26,180 --> 01:46:28,850
anytime something's not in that
place and I see it, it's a bug.

1791
01:46:29,420 --> 01:46:32,030
So I try to put it in that place as soon
as possible because otherwise I know

1792
01:46:32,031 --> 01:46:35,630
I'll forget. And then you know,
I'm coming over, I have a meeting,

1793
01:46:35,830 --> 01:46:38,780
I spend 10 minutes looking for my wallet
because I just stuck it someplace.

1794
01:46:38,840 --> 01:46:42,590
It's in the fridge or something, you
know, I'm always losing something.

1795
01:46:42,591 --> 01:46:46,910
Actually I lost one of our
initial investment checks.
It's a check for $400,000.

1796
01:46:46,911 --> 01:46:51,330
That's not good to lose. It
was a investor, Phil Black,

1797
01:46:51,390 --> 01:46:54,360
who is actually still on the board
today and he wrote a paper check,

1798
01:46:54,361 --> 01:46:57,720
like the kind that you would use the
grocery store or like from normal things.

1799
01:46:58,470 --> 01:47:01,110
As a foreigner, as most money I've
ever seen in my life. I was like,

1800
01:47:01,140 --> 01:47:04,350
I was 20 years old. I was like, what
is this? I expect it to be a check,

1801
01:47:04,351 --> 01:47:08,880
like a publisher's clearing the you have
a table, you could surf Lego, right,

1802
01:47:08,910 --> 01:47:12,240
like a floating carpet from Aladdin
down to the bank. So we raised,

1803
01:47:12,270 --> 01:47:15,750
luckily the other investors wired
their money because, and this place,

1804
01:47:15,751 --> 01:47:17,700
this check and I was thinking,
oh my goodness,

1805
01:47:17,701 --> 01:47:19,410
like what do I do with this situation?

1806
01:47:19,411 --> 01:47:24,411
Like cause obviously like he could stop
the check but then he's just and trusted

1807
01:47:25,681 --> 01:47:27,540
me with 400,000 and I've lost it.

1808
01:47:27,541 --> 01:47:30,630
Like what's the most irresponsible
thing you can do? So like do I tell him,

1809
01:47:30,631 --> 01:47:33,720
do I not tell him? Is he going to
notice at some point and months pass,

1810
01:47:33,730 --> 01:47:35,850
literally months pass.
He doesn't say anything.

1811
01:47:35,851 --> 01:47:37,440
I don't say anything because
you didn't want to ask him.

1812
01:47:37,890 --> 01:47:42,060
I didn't ask him and I'm going back to
Houston for Thanksgiving and I opened the

1813
01:47:42,061 --> 01:47:44,490
book I'm reading and
I'd use it as a bookmark

1814
01:47:47,480 --> 01:47:50,700
and it kind of fill out the book on the
plane. I was like, oh, oh my goodness.

1815
01:47:51,120 --> 01:47:55,860
It's quite a fine. That's better than
$20 at the pants you just washed. And uh,

1816
01:47:55,880 --> 01:47:58,650
so first thing I did when I landed,
I went to the Bank of America also.

1817
01:47:58,680 --> 01:48:01,770
I expected it to be like when you
hit Jackpot on like a slot machine,

1818
01:48:01,771 --> 01:48:04,980
like you've deposited 400 grand
checked like bell should go off.

1819
01:48:05,010 --> 01:48:08,220
Like they should like give you a
gospel of champagne or something.

1820
01:48:08,221 --> 01:48:13,221
But total non just dishonor events at
this local branch of Bank of America.

1821
01:48:13,571 --> 01:48:16,500
I just was like, oh, here
we go. Like okay, goodbye.

1822
01:48:16,520 --> 01:48:18,240
It's the most anti climatic thing ever.

1823
01:48:18,241 --> 01:48:21,320
But besides here you have
people behind you. I didn't,

1824
01:48:21,330 --> 01:48:24,870
I told them like a year later and he was
like, oh man. Yeah, he just hadn't looked.

1825
01:48:26,790 --> 01:48:31,050
So speaking of big numbers, how the hell
did you end up beating 140 or whatever?

1826
01:48:31,410 --> 01:48:35,190
Chicken mcnuggets why did that happen?
104 hundred and four.

1827
01:48:36,630 --> 01:48:39,900
I don't remember how long ago. It was
probably about 10 years ago at this point.

1828
01:48:39,940 --> 01:48:44,880
11 years ago. But the Superbowl was
in Houston, Texas. And, um, you know,

1829
01:48:44,881 --> 01:48:48,940
I lived like a mile from the reliant
stadium where they were doing the super

1830
01:48:48,941 --> 01:48:52,980
bowl. And so I was watching
and as for the super bowl,

1831
01:48:53,280 --> 01:48:58,280
all the Mcdonald's did a special where
he get 20 big nuggets for like $4 and I

1832
01:49:00,991 --> 01:49:03,000
was super broke at the time.
And so it was like, man,

1833
01:49:03,001 --> 01:49:06,950
I'm just going to stock up on these at
the way you might get like cans or you

1834
01:49:06,951 --> 01:49:09,210
know, things or ramen or
like cans of Campbell's,

1835
01:49:09,510 --> 01:49:11,430
which I would do when they went on sale.
I always buy a bunch of them.

1836
01:49:11,670 --> 01:49:13,750
So I just like got a bunch of
mcnuggets and then I was just stuck.

1837
01:49:13,770 --> 01:49:17,520
I love me nuggets and I the kind
of like sweet talk the person.

1838
01:49:17,521 --> 01:49:21,450
So they gave me lots of extra that sweet
and sour sauce and the Mcdonald's sweet

1839
01:49:21,451 --> 01:49:23,940
and sour sauce is not like sweet and
sour sauce anywhere else in the world.

1840
01:49:24,660 --> 01:49:27,630
Like all sweet and sour sauce is red.
And for some reason there's this brown,

1841
01:49:28,590 --> 01:49:32,760
I don't know why you might
been genetically engineered
to be as addictive as

1842
01:49:32,761 --> 01:49:35,730
possible. I don't know. It's so
good. So I just start popping them.

1843
01:49:35,731 --> 01:49:38,850
And next thing I knew it was 104 so
it wasn't even a better or anything.

1844
01:49:38,851 --> 01:49:43,830
You just rampaged through
104 while watching the super
bowl. That's it. Was this,

1845
01:49:43,910 --> 01:49:48,130
it was the Superbowl where Janet Jackson
had the wardrobe malfunction. Yeah, the

1846
01:49:48,130 --> 01:49:52,270
breast explosion. Sorry, I missed
that. How was, it was a gratifying,

1847
01:49:53,620 --> 01:49:58,210
I was watching it with my family and
there was like this moment of silence

1848
01:49:58,211 --> 01:50:00,730
afterwards were like,
what just happened?

1849
01:50:01,330 --> 01:50:06,330
I was completely mortified and I think
I had a laptop and the Internet and Wifi

1850
01:50:07,071 --> 01:50:09,610
I had the time. So I was like,
I put like what just happened?

1851
01:50:09,611 --> 01:50:11,050
Like I'm going to go on
the Internet and see.

1852
01:50:11,350 --> 01:50:15,580
And it turns out like what happened
happened. Like there was a wardrobe

1853
01:50:15,750 --> 01:50:20,370
function and I'm a good friend of mine
was in the audience about 15 feet away

1854
01:50:20,371 --> 01:50:22,980
from her. And you know, there's all
the theories that it was planned.

1855
01:50:23,080 --> 01:50:27,790
Yeah. And she said she was so pissed
off, like looked so angry. She has,

1856
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:31,780
it was not abs. Absolutely
not planned. I could've, yeah,

1857
01:50:31,781 --> 01:50:33,010
I would have bet that it was planned to.

1858
01:50:33,011 --> 01:50:35,530
This reminds me you're
shocking moment with your,

1859
01:50:35,890 --> 01:50:37,390
you're mortified little
bit with your parents.

1860
01:50:38,380 --> 01:50:43,070
When I went to the movies
with my entire family, uh,

1861
01:50:43,540 --> 01:50:47,320
and I was sitting next to my brother
and my parents were sitting on the other

1862
01:50:47,321 --> 01:50:50,020
side of my brother. We went to see
the girl with the Dragon Tattoo,

1863
01:50:50,021 --> 01:50:50,770
which I had read.

1864
01:50:50,770 --> 01:50:54,670
My brother had one credit and those of
you who've read the book or seen the

1865
01:50:54,671 --> 01:50:59,671
movie will know there's one particularly
just mortifying seeing a minute or two

1866
01:51:00,671 --> 01:51:03,590
beforehand. I was like, oh
yeah, excuse me. I have to
go get to go to the bathroom.

1867
01:51:03,591 --> 01:51:06,100
When I came back and my brother's like,
you fucker,

1868
01:51:07,890 --> 01:51:11,220
you knew exactly what was going to happen,
didn't you? And I was like, Yep. Yeah,

1869
01:51:11,290 --> 01:51:13,870
I did. Sorry about that. My
identical story was titanic,

1870
01:51:13,871 --> 01:51:15,520
which as much as much tamer,

1871
01:51:15,700 --> 01:51:18,250
but I just for some reason went to see
titanic with my mom and I was like, oh,

1872
01:51:18,251 --> 01:51:20,860
I think it's about to
happen that sees the car.

1873
01:51:20,861 --> 01:51:23,140
Seeing the car scene are there where
he's drawing hers. And I was like,

1874
01:51:23,380 --> 01:51:26,070
I'm just going to leave for
a few minutes and I cope.

1875
01:51:26,090 --> 01:51:30,610
It's over by the time I get back.
Uh, to switch gears a little bit,

1876
01:51:30,611 --> 01:51:32,110
when you think of the word successful,

1877
01:51:32,111 --> 01:51:34,120
who's the first person
who comes to mind and why?

1878
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:36,593
Hmm.

1879
01:51:37,010 --> 01:51:39,320
It's funny because he's getting
totally panned in the press right now,

1880
01:51:39,321 --> 01:51:40,400
but I think of Jeff basis.

1881
01:51:42,130 --> 01:51:42,963
Why'd you phases?

1882
01:51:44,410 --> 01:51:47,390
Well, why didn't you getting
pin? This is how I get informed.

1883
01:51:47,620 --> 01:51:49,810
Ah,
the fire phone was a complete flop.

1884
01:51:49,811 --> 01:51:52,240
They went down hundreds of
millions of dollars of inventory.

1885
01:51:52,270 --> 01:51:54,260
Obviously it didn't sell well.
Um,

1886
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:57,970
and articles have come out since then
saying how like he micromanage the whole

1887
01:51:57,971 --> 01:52:01,420
process and things like that. Um, I'm
actually gonna do a blog post about this.

1888
01:52:01,421 --> 01:52:05,470
One of my favorite business books is
called the halo effect and it talks about

1889
01:52:05,770 --> 01:52:10,240
the case study they use is Cisco and
sort of the 98 to 2002 time period.

1890
01:52:10,810 --> 01:52:11,643
How,

1891
01:52:11,950 --> 01:52:14,590
and sort of when they were on the rise
and one of the most valuable companies in

1892
01:52:14,591 --> 01:52:17,650
the world, high stock. And when
Saint John Chambers is genius,

1893
01:52:18,010 --> 01:52:21,420
they acquire companies, they don't have
to invent everything. They can, you know,

1894
01:52:22,090 --> 01:52:24,970
acquire dozens of companies and integrate
them and the competitors just can't

1895
01:52:25,030 --> 01:52:28,210
compete.
And then once they started crashing again,

1896
01:52:28,211 --> 01:52:30,790
nothing changed about the business.
But the stock goes down the same.

1897
01:52:30,820 --> 01:52:35,370
Sometimes the same writers were saying,
Oh, it's a mishmash of infighting.

1898
01:52:35,380 --> 01:52:39,280
They have all this like technology that
doesn't integrate and they can't invent

1899
01:52:39,281 --> 01:52:40,960
things so they have to acquire it.
So Lou,

1900
01:52:40,961 --> 01:52:44,390
the same strategy is viewed
in a totally different realm.

1901
01:52:44,391 --> 01:52:46,070
And this is halo effect as

1902
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:48,980
a case study going on right now with
Amazon. So we're a few years ago,

1903
01:52:48,981 --> 01:52:51,410
everyone said how Amazon
makes these big bets.

1904
01:52:51,560 --> 01:52:54,800
They're willing to lose money for years
and years and something like the kindle

1905
01:52:55,010 --> 01:52:57,770
and just ruthlessly iterate over
and over Amazon web services,

1906
01:52:57,890 --> 01:53:02,720
they go into places where no one says they
should go. Um, the fire phone flopped.

1907
01:53:02,780 --> 01:53:05,780
And everyone's saying, Ah,
these idiots, you know, this,

1908
01:53:05,960 --> 01:53:09,140
the attention to detail becomes
micromanaging, you know that everything.

1909
01:53:09,380 --> 01:53:13,970
But ultimately what I admire in the
longterm as Jeff Bezos has convictions

1910
01:53:13,971 --> 01:53:17,630
around things and he's going to be wrong
sometimes I don't expect them to be

1911
01:53:17,631 --> 01:53:18,464
perfect,

1912
01:53:18,680 --> 01:53:23,600
but I do expect him in my idolize mine
to continue making those big bets and

1913
01:53:23,900 --> 01:53:28,160
he's probably not taking it for risk if
he doesn't super mess it up every couple

1914
01:53:28,160 --> 01:53:31,330
of years. Oh, I totally agree.
And just the story of basis.

1915
01:53:31,340 --> 01:53:33,290
I haven't read the everything store.
I would like to,

1916
01:53:34,160 --> 01:53:37,240
I don't know if you have
excellent book. Yeah. Uh, but uh,

1917
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:40,010
sounds like a good time to buy Amazon.
This is not investment advice.

1918
01:53:40,190 --> 01:53:44,390
Consult your regulatory attorney
and professional wealth advisor,

1919
01:53:44,391 --> 01:53:49,391
but it's when those types of sort of
capricious judgements are made based on a

1920
01:53:49,641 --> 01:53:53,120
one off event,
especially in the,

1921
01:53:54,530 --> 01:53:56,930
well sometimes this macro related,

1922
01:53:56,931 --> 01:54:00,770
sometimes it's just a
single launch related. God,

1923
01:54:00,771 --> 01:54:03,410
it's so funny how quick,
how quickly people are deterred.

1924
01:54:03,411 --> 01:54:07,130
All though I will tell you most of the
time I don't believe the words as they're

1925
01:54:07,131 --> 01:54:11,300
written on the page. I think they're
just journalists with a tough job,

1926
01:54:11,960 --> 01:54:14,690
which sometimes I think
borders on unethical,

1927
01:54:14,691 --> 01:54:19,460
which is having to churn out a lot of
content and tenuously on an unreasonable

1928
01:54:19,461 --> 01:54:24,461
schedule and to come up with insights
that are with rare exception,

1929
01:54:24,831 --> 01:54:27,140
very,
very difficult to produce

1930
01:54:29,090 --> 01:54:33,620
on demand as Aha moments once a day
or five times a day or 12 times a day.

1931
01:54:33,620 --> 01:54:37,460
So they end up regurgitating or rewording
things they've written before and the

1932
01:54:37,461 --> 01:54:41,300
people with the most knowledge about a
given topic don't necessarily have any

1933
01:54:41,301 --> 01:54:43,640
incentive to write about it.
Absolutely not.

1934
01:54:43,910 --> 01:54:48,440
So do you buy and sell individual stocks?
I don't right now.

1935
01:54:48,680 --> 01:54:53,630
My personality, my intestinal fortitude
is not well suited to public stocks.

1936
01:54:54,180 --> 01:54:54,520
Uh,

1937
01:54:54,520 --> 01:54:59,520
I don't like having the option
on a daily basis to buy and sell.

1938
01:54:59,900 --> 01:55:04,730
Yeah. I like doing a ton of
due diligence, investing in,

1939
01:55:04,910 --> 01:55:08,280
for instance, a startup and
then betting on a seven to nine,

1940
01:55:08,570 --> 01:55:12,500
seven to nine year growth
curve or longer or longer.

1941
01:55:12,560 --> 01:55:17,000
Now automatics coming up on 10
yeah. And I'm not, I'm not overly,

1942
01:55:17,660 --> 01:55:19,280
that doesn't,
that doesn't concern me.

1943
01:55:19,281 --> 01:55:24,281
It actually consoles me because it forces
me to do more homework on the front

1944
01:55:24,561 --> 01:55:29,190
end. I agree. Um, I use wealth
front and also an investor in,

1945
01:55:29,220 --> 01:55:31,910
but or both an investor and Melbourne's,
I get individual stocks,

1946
01:55:31,911 --> 01:55:34,790
like if I like maker bought and
sold to a company called Stratasys.

1947
01:55:34,790 --> 01:55:38,570
So I ended up with a bunch of Stratasys
doc and it was really knowing to have

1948
01:55:38,571 --> 01:55:42,200
like this minute,
the minute number that moves.

1949
01:55:42,201 --> 01:55:45,930
Like that's the one thing I wouldn't
look forward to it being a public company

1950
01:55:46,500 --> 01:55:50,700
is, oh, raising money is hard as well
because basically saying something,

1951
01:55:50,970 --> 01:55:54,960
your life's work, this is what it's
worth, right? They're quantifying it.

1952
01:55:55,320 --> 01:55:57,060
I can't imagine what it's
like with the minute,

1953
01:55:57,061 --> 01:56:00,930
the minute vagaries of the market.
Public markets.

1954
01:56:01,940 --> 01:56:02,340
I'm so,

1955
01:56:02,340 --> 01:56:07,340
I'm so continually impressed by people
like nuts and Talib or many of the hedge

1956
01:56:09,211 --> 01:56:14,211
fund guys out there who are develop a
hypothesis about a particular way to

1957
01:56:17,011 --> 01:56:19,530
approach a short,
a short sale or short position.

1958
01:56:19,890 --> 01:56:24,890
So they're looking at the
subprime mortgage crisis
and they're trying to bet on

1959
01:56:25,561 --> 01:56:30,540
that happening or the sovereign
debt issues in Europe for instance.

1960
01:56:31,320 --> 01:56:36,320
And their ability to just bleed for
extended periods of time with these option

1961
01:56:36,511 --> 01:56:40,650
positions and function as normal human
beings and be okay with losing money

1962
01:56:40,651 --> 01:56:43,650
every, all losing money every day and
having people tell you you're an idiot.

1963
01:56:43,800 --> 01:56:48,090
Yeah. Uh, where you, I just,

1964
01:56:48,120 --> 01:56:52,890
I can't fathom actually handling that
well personally. So oddly enough,

1965
01:56:52,891 --> 01:56:57,891
the binary nature of startups suits
my psychology well because it,

1966
01:56:58,920 --> 01:57:03,390
it's applying a constraint and removing
decisions than I might otherwise botch

1967
01:57:03,630 --> 01:57:04,230
emotionally.

1968
01:57:04,230 --> 01:57:09,230
So I can be very highly rational on the
front end and make a specific type of

1969
01:57:09,271 --> 01:57:12,150
investment that precludes me from
making stupid emotional decisions.

1970
01:57:12,360 --> 01:57:16,830
And emotionally you want to buy high
and sell low at that? Oh, definitely.

1971
01:57:16,860 --> 01:57:19,470
If it's dropping, I got like I get out
of it. So if it's rising and like, oh,

1972
01:57:19,471 --> 01:57:20,730
it's great,
I'm going to buy some more.

1973
01:57:21,150 --> 01:57:26,100
Are there any particular
books on investing or books
that you've read that have

1974
01:57:26,310 --> 01:57:30,810
helped you think about investing?
My, he said that the man, uh,

1975
01:57:31,320 --> 01:57:36,240
[inaudible] you're the one who introduced
me to the Black Swan actually I was in

1976
01:57:36,241 --> 01:57:40,950
Greece. I don't recommend
that to everyone. So I love
the Black Swan. I love it.

1977
01:57:41,100 --> 01:57:44,370
Uh, fooled by randomness.
Antifragility his latest one.

1978
01:57:44,610 --> 01:57:46,110
I love his book of Aphorisms.

1979
01:57:46,550 --> 01:57:48,960
I kids writing has been super
influential on me both in,

1980
01:57:49,080 --> 01:57:53,100
in and of itself and also in the works
that he's pointed me towards because he

1981
01:57:53,101 --> 01:57:56,550
makes a ton of sometimes annoyingly
so references to other things. Yeah.

1982
01:57:56,700 --> 01:58:01,700
But I came introduced me to emerge a
echo and other really fantastic author.

1983
01:58:02,121 --> 01:58:06,000
So, um, he's great. And then, you
know, reading Warren Buffett's letters.

1984
01:58:06,240 --> 01:58:08,520
I was leading a Warren Buffett friend Fan.

1985
01:58:09,150 --> 01:58:13,040
I wish I were a big Warren Buffett
friend. I am a big Warren Buffett Fan. Uh,

1986
01:58:13,380 --> 01:58:15,810
and I know that name is,

1987
01:58:15,870 --> 01:58:18,450
is bandied about a lot by of
course millions of investors,

1988
01:58:18,451 --> 01:58:19,470
but the annual letters,

1989
01:58:20,310 --> 01:58:23,190
getting it straight from the horse's
mouth as opposed to the second or third

1990
01:58:23,191 --> 01:58:28,110
hand interpretations is just phenomenal.
It is something I can say.

1991
01:58:28,111 --> 01:58:32,880
You asked about what we look for for
candidates hiring, um, clarity of writing.

1992
01:58:33,960 --> 01:58:36,570
I think clarity of writing
indicates clarity of thinking.

1993
01:58:36,840 --> 01:58:40,130
Writing is honestly one of the hardest
things they do everyday at various.

1994
01:58:40,260 --> 01:58:42,070
You've written a couple
now I've tried to write

1995
01:58:42,070 --> 01:58:45,850
a book. I can't, I haven't been able to
do it. It's a very masochistic process.

1996
01:58:46,210 --> 01:58:49,000
I would not want to inflict on,
on anyone unduly.

1997
01:58:49,630 --> 01:58:53,770
But I love reading about writers in the
process of writing like bird by bird and

1998
01:58:53,780 --> 01:58:57,360
Lamont or on writing. Well,
I Williams enzyme, um,

1999
01:58:57,730 --> 01:58:59,080
there Ernest Hemingway and writing,

2000
01:58:59,081 --> 01:59:01,800
which I think I got from
this podcast actually. Yeah,

2001
01:59:02,020 --> 01:59:05,530
that's a funny one because when you
can rent well you can think well.

2002
01:59:05,590 --> 01:59:07,960
And so when I find obviously
in Warren Buffet's letters,

2003
01:59:07,961 --> 01:59:09,400
the thinking is so clear.

2004
01:59:09,910 --> 01:59:12,610
And so that's something I look for in
these sort of random emails we get our

2005
01:59:12,611 --> 01:59:16,870
cover letters or resumes is a well
written. If someone's a great writer,

2006
01:59:16,930 --> 01:59:21,280
they tend to be a great
programmer or efficient or
something else. So, um, again,

2007
01:59:21,281 --> 01:59:26,150
it's not everything, but it's
a strong indicator. So just
a few more questions. Uh,

2008
01:59:26,230 --> 01:59:28,900
the first is

2009
01:59:30,430 --> 01:59:35,110
from wow. Valora Thor, that
is a fantastic name, sir.

2010
01:59:35,740 --> 01:59:40,240
What role will wordpress spelled correctly
play in online content outside of the

2011
01:59:40,241 --> 01:59:43,840
browser example, given mobile apps,
Apis, et cetera. In the near future.

2012
01:59:45,340 --> 01:59:47,110
It's inside baseball,
but a very good question.

2013
01:59:47,380 --> 01:59:51,070
So there's been basically two
waves and WordPress's history. Uh,

2014
01:59:51,100 --> 01:59:55,270
we started to just blogging Lily's just
a blog and you'd have the rest of your

2015
01:59:55,271 --> 01:59:57,760
website doing something else. Then
you'd plug the blog in your wordpress,

2016
01:59:58,420 --> 01:59:59,830
we'd spend it to be a CMS.

2017
02:00:00,050 --> 02:00:03,430
It was the second wave of wordpress and
then it started powering your entire

2018
02:00:03,431 --> 02:00:04,780
site.
So,

2019
02:00:05,180 --> 02:00:08,170
and that's been really the past five or
six years where we become almost like

2020
02:00:08,171 --> 02:00:10,540
the dial tone of the web.
Like if you're starting a website,

2021
02:00:10,750 --> 02:00:13,510
he started with wordpress and then
you plug other things into wordpress,

2022
02:00:13,840 --> 02:00:17,440
whether that's ecommerce
management, CRM, whatever it is,

2023
02:00:17,470 --> 02:00:18,640
it's a plugin for wordpress.

2024
02:00:19,270 --> 02:00:22,030
This third wave that we're going
through right now is word press as an

2025
02:00:22,031 --> 02:00:22,990
application platform.

2026
02:00:23,860 --> 02:00:28,360
So people are using the primitives
and the things afforded by WordPress's

2027
02:00:28,361 --> 02:00:29,194
infrastructure,

2028
02:00:29,560 --> 02:00:33,970
the things that we wrote to write a
blog and CMS to write other things.

2029
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:38,290
The primitives are the elements of the
infrastructure that we're used to create

2030
02:00:38,291 --> 02:00:40,240
those things in the first place.
Yeah.

2031
02:00:40,241 --> 02:00:43,000
So think of a primitive as a
basic building block. Got It.

2032
02:00:43,001 --> 02:00:46,870
So like a social primitive one that
Kevin Rosen invented was like this

2033
02:00:47,080 --> 02:00:50,200
embeddable button that lets you vote
on things, right? The dig it button,

2034
02:00:50,201 --> 02:00:52,900
which is now the like button,
the tweet button, et cetera. Um,

2035
02:00:53,020 --> 02:00:57,100
that's a primitive semis. So we have
primitives around user authentication,

2036
02:00:57,101 --> 02:01:00,220
around content types,
around caching, around URLs,

2037
02:01:00,221 --> 02:01:02,680
around lots of things that if you're
building something from scratch,

2038
02:01:02,681 --> 02:01:05,230
you got to do all this stuff, right?
So if you can start with wordpress,

2039
02:01:05,231 --> 02:01:09,430
it's saves you months. Um,
not for everything, not for
everyone. But if you know,

2040
02:01:09,431 --> 02:01:13,330
wordpress, it, you know, you start, um,

2041
02:01:13,960 --> 02:01:16,450
I'm gonna ask you [inaudible] 80 miles
per hour because I like asking silly

2042
02:01:16,451 --> 02:01:20,360
questions. Uh, as a, as
a nun, non programmer,

2043
02:01:20,890 --> 02:01:24,910
how does, uh, and I know it
differs significantly, but
how does that differ from,

2044
02:01:24,911 --> 02:01:27,970
say, ruby on rails, whoever be
in real estate and they similar,

2045
02:01:28,240 --> 02:01:32,140
it's people using wordpress
as a framework. It's a
framework which does a lot,

2046
02:01:33,400 --> 02:01:36,610
has a lot more things built
out than like a ruby might. Um,

2047
02:01:37,390 --> 02:01:42,080
so think of it as the thing
that wordpress does built.

2048
02:01:43,340 --> 02:01:48,080
If what you want to build looks like that.
So not a game, not a chat application,

2049
02:01:48,081 --> 02:01:49,760
not something like that.
If it looks like content,

2050
02:01:50,360 --> 02:01:54,200
we've already managed more content than
anyone else in the world at this point.

2051
02:01:55,160 --> 02:01:57,680
I'm using our data
structures using our APIs.

2052
02:01:57,681 --> 02:01:58,880
It's probably the best way to go about it.

2053
02:01:59,060 --> 02:02:03,770
What are some of the big companies or
publications that use your platform?

2054
02:02:04,850 --> 02:02:07,550
It's pretty much all of them
at this point. Washington
Post, Wall Street Journal,

2055
02:02:07,610 --> 02:02:12,140
New York Times, um,
international papers, uh,

2056
02:02:12,170 --> 02:02:16,550
new media. So Giga Ohm, tech crunch,
recode, all the tech blogs basically.

2057
02:02:17,030 --> 02:02:21,050
Um, years mean it's really
the technique, very flattered.

2058
02:02:24,160 --> 02:02:26,870
But I try it,
if you look at tech meme,

2059
02:02:26,900 --> 02:02:31,610
like we'll typically power 50 to 70% of
all the sites that are in tech meme on a

2060
02:02:31,610 --> 02:02:34,430
given day. Um, tech meme. For
those people who don't know,

2061
02:02:34,431 --> 02:02:37,220
would you say it's fair to say it's a
roundup of tech news from around the web?

2062
02:02:37,460 --> 02:02:39,470
It's one of my vices.
We talked about vices earlier.

2063
02:02:39,471 --> 02:02:43,550
So t e c h m e m e.com.
It's um,

2064
02:02:43,970 --> 02:02:47,630
it's algorithmic and human. It's the
best tech newspaper in the world like it,

2065
02:02:47,870 --> 02:02:50,960
and it just links you to places.
So almost like a drudge report,

2066
02:02:50,961 --> 02:02:54,290
but it's so much better. Um,
you go to the primary sources.

2067
02:02:54,500 --> 02:02:57,980
So what sometimes might be not even news,
like a tech crunch or verge,

2068
02:02:57,981 --> 02:03:01,160
but the actual person like you or me,
real interested,

2069
02:03:01,190 --> 02:03:04,160
they'll link to the originals as well,
which is really nice.

2070
02:03:04,880 --> 02:03:09,880
What if you had to point
a 20 year old entrepreneur

2071
02:03:12,770 --> 02:03:16,370
who's looking to start a company, let's
just say it's tech for the time being,

2072
02:03:16,760 --> 02:03:21,760
what two or three books or resources
would you give to them or suggest to them?

2073
02:03:24,980 --> 02:03:29,630
I'm going to repeat with the effective
executive or anything from Peter Drucker.

2074
02:03:29,631 --> 02:03:32,090
He actually has one, I think it's
called the art of entrepreneurship.

2075
02:03:32,120 --> 02:03:34,640
It's got entrepreneurship in
the title. Super good. Again,

2076
02:03:34,641 --> 02:03:37,250
these are old now and like from
the seventies or eighties though,

2077
02:03:37,820 --> 02:03:38,660
but they're so good.

2078
02:03:38,661 --> 02:03:41,990
He's just one of the clearest thinkers
about all these things about management,

2079
02:03:41,991 --> 02:03:44,560
about entrepreneurship.
When I was getting started,

2080
02:03:44,561 --> 02:03:48,200
I actually really loved the art
of the start by Guy Kawasaki.

2081
02:03:48,840 --> 02:03:52,450
Aggregate it since then. Yeah, no,
it, it stands up pretty well there,

2082
02:03:52,451 --> 02:03:55,870
but I'm really inspired me.
I think she read the four hour work week.

2083
02:03:56,130 --> 02:04:00,320
Just I'm going to plug you go and
a recent one, like a brand new one.

2084
02:04:00,800 --> 02:04:03,650
Um, I'll say two brand new ones. I'm
sorry you asked for three to give.

2085
02:04:03,660 --> 02:04:05,410
You can keep going. You can go. Um,

2086
02:04:05,480 --> 02:04:08,810
the hard things about hard things
by Ben Horowitz. Pretty good.

2087
02:04:08,840 --> 02:04:11,480
Entertaining more than anything.
Like I read that book, I was like,

2088
02:04:11,510 --> 02:04:16,040
I would never work for this guy but
I'm entertaining and some good lessons.

2089
02:04:16,041 --> 02:04:19,250
And then Peter teals zero to
101 I thought was excellent.

2090
02:04:19,730 --> 02:04:21,960
It's to one is great and
people should definitely,

2091
02:04:21,961 --> 02:04:24,110
if they find that interesting
and they are going into tech,

2092
02:04:24,140 --> 02:04:28,550
I think try to read the original
classmates as well. Yeah.

2093
02:04:28,580 --> 02:04:32,240
By Blake masters I believe. Exactly.
They're really just tremendous.

2094
02:04:32,660 --> 02:04:37,440
All of these guys. I mean don't take them
as Gospel, like disagree with them, uh,

2095
02:04:37,500 --> 02:04:39,670
interpreted in your own way.
Um,

2096
02:04:40,080 --> 02:04:44,370
if some people who are admire quite a
bit like saying Marc Andreessen, uh,

2097
02:04:44,640 --> 02:04:45,990
when we first pitched him,

2098
02:04:46,590 --> 02:04:49,860
the whole meeting was about
how distributed companies
were a terrible idea.

2099
02:04:51,120 --> 02:04:51,811
And he was like,
well,

2100
02:04:51,811 --> 02:04:55,530
what do you know that every other tech
company that's been big in history

2101
02:04:55,700 --> 02:04:59,220
doesn't the Facebooks, the googles,
the Microsofts to everything.

2102
02:04:59,270 --> 02:05:01,910
And so why should you do
something different? Um,

2103
02:05:02,760 --> 02:05:06,210
and it turns out it was a good meeting.
I thought it was terrible.

2104
02:05:06,240 --> 02:05:08,490
Me I thought was the worst
meeting of my like entire career.

2105
02:05:08,580 --> 02:05:11,430
And I thought that's his style is he
challenges you and sees how you spot.

2106
02:05:11,460 --> 02:05:14,840
But um, you know, sometimes
going against the orthodoxy,

2107
02:05:14,850 --> 02:05:17,760
doing the things that other people can't
do. I think of it like business judo.

2108
02:05:18,300 --> 02:05:22,170
What can we do that now Google makes
tens or hundreds of billions of dollars

2109
02:05:22,171 --> 02:05:25,080
more than us? What can we
do that we can't do? Well,

2110
02:05:25,470 --> 02:05:29,370
they're set up best to work in the office
culture and where's it at best to work

2111
02:05:29,371 --> 02:05:33,030
in an office culture so we can get
the smartest people in the world who

2112
02:05:33,031 --> 02:05:36,840
sometimes leave Google cause they want
to live in Salt Lake City or Adelaide,

2113
02:05:36,841 --> 02:05:40,740
Australia or someplace else for whatever
reason, it doesn't matter. But, um,

2114
02:05:41,280 --> 02:05:43,980
they're just as good as anyone
inside the mountain view offices,

2115
02:05:44,340 --> 02:05:47,100
but they just don't happen to be
in mountain view. It's like the,

2116
02:05:47,101 --> 02:05:50,610
it makes me think of the book, the
starfish and the spider. And, uh,

2117
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:53,690
particularly with the open source
component, right. Open sources.

2118
02:05:53,691 --> 02:05:57,240
I'm going to the open source.
Wordpress isn't going to die. Uh,

2119
02:05:57,241 --> 02:06:01,250
even if even if automatic
were to cease operations. Uh,

2120
02:06:04,100 --> 02:06:05,000
well even to this day,

2121
02:06:05,001 --> 02:06:08,390
we compete with people 10 times their
size and 10 or a hundred times a

2122
02:06:08,391 --> 02:06:12,570
capitalization. Uh, in 2014,
one of our competitors,

2123
02:06:12,580 --> 02:06:16,490
Squarespace spent north of
$45 million on advertising.

2124
02:06:16,550 --> 02:06:18,590
They did Superbowl
advertiser, didn't they? Yeah,

2125
02:06:18,630 --> 02:06:22,540
they're going to do more this year.
That's expensive. But they had to. Yep.

2126
02:06:22,790 --> 02:06:24,800
You know, that's the only
way they can get customers.

2127
02:06:24,830 --> 02:06:27,310
Where because we have this
community because we have these, uh,

2128
02:06:27,730 --> 02:06:31,200
hundreds of thousands of developers
all over the world because we have, um,

2129
02:06:31,700 --> 02:06:33,860
the sort of intrinsic, I think,
goodness of the software.

2130
02:06:34,490 --> 02:06:37,790
We don't have to spend advertising in
2014 we spent about a million dollars on

2131
02:06:37,791 --> 02:06:41,540
advertising and that was mostly events.
And you do love events.

2132
02:06:41,930 --> 02:06:46,640
I love your events too. They're
very well done. Thank you. Uh, okay.

2133
02:06:46,641 --> 02:06:47,450
Two more questions.

2134
02:06:47,450 --> 02:06:52,450
If you were sent to desert island
and you could bring one album

2135
02:06:55,420 --> 02:06:57,710
fest, a lot of book questions, I'm
trying to come up with something else.

2136
02:06:57,770 --> 02:06:58,603
One album,

2137
02:07:01,970 --> 02:07:06,080
one album and two other items that were
non survival related, what would they be?

2138
02:07:09,340 --> 02:07:11,040
The album's really tough.

2139
02:07:13,090 --> 02:07:16,750
There are some really perfect albums out
there. Like I think Radiohead's okay.

2140
02:07:16,751 --> 02:07:19,480
Computer. It's like just a perfect
album and it works as an alum.

2141
02:07:19,540 --> 02:07:24,070
The individual songs don't
work as well or like, uh, uh,

2142
02:07:24,071 --> 02:07:26,650
frank ocean's mix tape,
alternate out. I like that.

2143
02:07:26,651 --> 02:07:30,310
Some of these that are just so good.
Kendrick Lamars, good kid. Matt City,

2144
02:07:30,640 --> 02:07:31,930
you got check checkout chick,
Kendrick Lamar.

2145
02:07:31,931 --> 02:07:34,330
I know you're not as in as the
hippity hop. Oh that's not true.

2146
02:07:34,450 --> 02:07:36,100
If it's break beats are danceable and

2147
02:07:36,100 --> 02:07:40,270
I like the lyrics. I'm all for it
like Eric B and Rakim and that.

2148
02:07:40,271 --> 02:07:43,120
Ill How old are you?
67.

2149
02:07:43,530 --> 02:07:46,410
I'm just giving you a hard time but
this is a new guys that are super close.

2150
02:07:46,420 --> 02:07:47,290
There are some good guys.

2151
02:07:47,320 --> 02:07:52,320
I what I don't like is the homogenates
we have a lot of the beat structure

2152
02:07:54,010 --> 02:07:57,460
that has been sort of commoditized for
top 40. That stuff makes me insane.

2153
02:07:58,090 --> 02:08:00,250
But if it's,
if it has some unique

2154
02:08:00,630 --> 02:08:03,790
flavor rhythms yeah. All for it.
Yeah. You like Kendrick Lamar. Um,

2155
02:08:04,120 --> 02:08:08,200
so probably one of those albums and if
I have to pick one, I'll pick a jasmine,

2156
02:08:08,620 --> 02:08:10,990
uh,
Sonny Rollins saxophone colossus.

2157
02:08:11,590 --> 02:08:14,290
I could listen to that album the rest
of my life and learn something new every

2158
02:08:14,291 --> 02:08:19,090
day. Uh, in terms of other
nonessential items that aren't books,

2159
02:08:19,210 --> 02:08:21,210
I'm not going to say a kindle
or an encyclopedia or something.

2160
02:08:21,250 --> 02:08:25,690
Know a 50 millimeter,
1.4 Prime Lens. Okay.

2161
02:08:25,780 --> 02:08:30,780
Is the Lens I would take to a
deserted islands and I burned easily,

2162
02:08:30,791 --> 02:08:31,900
so probably a umbrella.

2163
02:08:33,940 --> 02:08:37,770
You and I bond over that. I thought I
was the only human who didn't tell him,

2164
02:08:38,130 --> 02:08:42,300
but alas, Hark. Matt Mullenweg.

2165
02:08:42,750 --> 02:08:44,430
Uh,
last question.

2166
02:08:44,970 --> 02:08:49,620
If you could give your 20 year
old self a piece of advice,

2167
02:08:49,680 --> 02:08:53,700
one piece of advice, what would
it be? Slow down. Slow down.

2168
02:08:54,660 --> 02:08:55,493
Why

2169
02:08:56,980 --> 02:09:01,880
we talked about it with running earlier,
like slow down to go further. Um,

2170
02:09:02,800 --> 02:09:05,620
I think a lot of the mistakes in my
youth where mistakes have ambition,

2171
02:09:05,740 --> 02:09:10,090
not mistakes of sloth,
sloth and um,

2172
02:09:12,130 --> 02:09:15,850
I think building foundations, building
things that last for the long term.

2173
02:09:16,300 --> 02:09:18,700
Obviously some of that's
happened, but, um,

2174
02:09:19,030 --> 02:09:22,420
some of it I think I
rushed through education. I
definitely kind of squandered,

2175
02:09:22,540 --> 02:09:23,710
you know,
even when I was in high school,

2176
02:09:23,711 --> 02:09:25,450
like they put great books in front of us,

2177
02:09:25,451 --> 02:09:29,330
like the great Gatsby or
subsidies or something,

2178
02:09:29,331 --> 02:09:31,750
and they said it is I dug into,
but like others like Fitzgerald,

2179
02:09:32,170 --> 02:09:36,370
I just can't do the bare minimum to pass
the class or pass the test when now I

2180
02:09:36,371 --> 02:09:40,000
would kill for the luxury to just like
really sit down with one of his books and

2181
02:09:40,001 --> 02:09:42,410
dive into it and discuss it.
Um,

2182
02:09:43,660 --> 02:09:47,140
and so just slowing down
whether that's meditating,

2183
02:09:47,141 --> 02:09:49,510
whether that's taking time for yourself,
away from screens,

2184
02:09:50,200 --> 02:09:54,130
whether that's really focusing in on who
you're talking to or who you're with.

2185
02:09:54,970 --> 02:09:57,640
But as I've aged,

2186
02:09:59,710 --> 02:10:01,400
I know it sounds ridiculous.
Yes.

2187
02:10:02,620 --> 02:10:06,190
It's interesting because I had a
lot of living in dog years though.

2188
02:10:06,220 --> 02:10:10,120
I mean the amount of experience that you
can press into each years. Unbelievable.

2189
02:10:10,121 --> 02:10:10,400
Well,

2190
02:10:10,400 --> 02:10:11,000
I have a lot of,

2191
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:14,750
I had a lot of success at a young age
was intimidating because you sometimes

2192
02:10:14,751 --> 02:10:15,140
think,

2193
02:10:15,140 --> 02:10:20,140
am I ever going to top this or did
I peak at 20 or 21 when I was doing

2194
02:10:20,151 --> 02:10:23,670
polyphasic sleep? And writing these
new things and everything since then,

2195
02:10:23,671 --> 02:10:25,610
some downhill.
Um,

2196
02:10:25,640 --> 02:10:29,210
you wonder about impact on the world.

2197
02:10:29,690 --> 02:10:34,690
But ultimately it's funny that now
what I more about is a lot narrower.

2198
02:10:34,820 --> 02:10:39,110
It's like the people who you love and
the people that love you and you don't

2199
02:10:39,111 --> 02:10:41,850
always choose either of
those, right. It's not as,

2200
02:10:41,851 --> 02:10:44,810
he can't help you fall in love with life
would be so much easier if you could.

2201
02:10:45,680 --> 02:10:49,040
That's true. And do you don't always
choose who falls in love with you and,

2202
02:10:49,041 --> 02:10:50,420
but there's responsibility on both.

2203
02:10:50,840 --> 02:10:54,830
And really focusing on those people I
found has contributed more to my happiness

2204
02:10:54,900 --> 02:10:58,400
and I want to say anything else. I
think that's a great place to end. Matt,

2205
02:10:58,401 --> 02:11:02,480
where can people learn more about you?
Find you on the Internet?
