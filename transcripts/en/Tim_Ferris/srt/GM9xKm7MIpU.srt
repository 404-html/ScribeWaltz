1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,850
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02,851 --> 00:00:06,910
I can run flat out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking. No else.

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:07,920
You were posting a question.

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,440
I'm a cybernetic organism living tissue.

5
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,090
This episode is brought to you by
gymnastic bodies.com this is the training

6
00:00:28,091 --> 00:00:32,020
system that I am most obsessed with
at the moment and I don't get paid any

7
00:00:32,021 --> 00:00:33,430
commissions or anything like that.

8
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,300
You may have heard coach summer on
the podcast who designed the program,

9
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,480
former national team coach
for men's gymnastics.

10
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,070
I am not easily impressed at and I've
just been completely blown away by the

11
00:00:45,071 --> 00:00:48,460
sophistication of his programming
and the elegance of his programming.

12
00:00:48,461 --> 00:00:52,990
I've been using gymnastic bodies for
just a few months now and I feel more

13
00:00:52,991 --> 00:00:53,800
flexible,

14
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:58,300
stronger and younger than I have in
years and it sounds cheesy to hear myself

15
00:00:58,301 --> 00:00:59,890
say that,
but it's true.

16
00:00:59,891 --> 00:01:02,830
That's the hardest part to
believe and you can check it out.

gymnastic bodies.com forward slash Tim
you can take a look at the fundamentals

19
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,660
course, which I'll help you diagnose
your weakest points, areas to improve,

20
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:17,843
et Cetera,

21
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:21,490
and I highly encourage you take a look
at this bodyweight training system.

22
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,270
It is incredible.

23
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:28,520
Okay,

24
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,620
this podcast is brought
to you by trunk club.

25
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:35,570
I hate shopping with a passion and you
guys know this and I'm honestly not any

26
00:01:35,571 --> 00:01:39,590
good at it anyway, which means I end up
looking like I'm colorblind or homeless.

27
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,660
This is where trunk club comes in,

28
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,290
which provides you with your own personal
stylist and makes it easier than ever

29
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:47,510
to shop for clothes that
look great on your body.

30
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,400
Even if you suck at picking clothing,

31
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,630
just go to trunk club.com forward slash
Tim and answer a few questions and then

32
00:01:53,631 --> 00:01:57,590
you'll be sent a trunk full of awesome
clothes. They base this on your sizes,

33
00:01:57,591 --> 00:02:02,360
preferences, all that jazz. The trunk is
then delivered free of charge both ways,

34
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:04,340
so you only pay for clothes that you keep.

35
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:08,630
So you have prepaid stickers and whatnot.
If you keep none, it costs you nothing.

36
00:02:08,631 --> 00:02:13,130
It's super easy. Trunk Club is not a
subscription service I wanted to avoid.

37
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:16,940
There are no monthly fees. Also want
to avoid that your stylist is free.

38
00:02:16,941 --> 00:02:19,910
Shipping is always free and you
have 10 days to try on the clothes.

39
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:23,060
Risk free and trunk club
is backed by Nordstrom,

40
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:26,390
which means they have
the highest standards and
quality and customer service.

44
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,600
Hello Ladies and germs.

45
00:02:40,601 --> 00:02:44,140
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another
episode of the Tim Ferriss show where

46
00:02:44,141 --> 00:02:48,550
it is usually my job to deconstruct
world class performers to tease apart the

47
00:02:48,551 --> 00:02:51,220
habits, routines,
favorite books, et Cetera,

48
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:55,930
dozens of things so that you can act on
from people ranging from chess prodigies

49
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,340
to four star generals.

50
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:01,360
Special OPS commander is to everybody
in between professional athletes,

51
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:03,610
you name it.
In this particular episode,

52
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:08,620
we have an in between a sewed
with Seth Goden, his last episode,

53
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:13,210
which covers a lot of his
bio and everything else. We
really dug into the weeds.

54
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:17,230
Super Fun is long. That one was
about two, two and a half hours long.

55
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,160
This one is short,

56
00:03:18,161 --> 00:03:23,161
it's about 30 minutes long and you can
think of it as philosophical steroids.

57
00:03:23,441 --> 00:03:27,220
I listened to this. It takes a couple
minutes to get warmed up, so be patient.

58
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:32,520
But there are some incredible gems and
I listened to a few times including how

59
00:03:33,071 --> 00:03:37,240
to keep track of the right things and
creating a narrative that serves you as

60
00:03:37,241 --> 00:03:40,690
opposed to handicaps you.
It's very, very simple,

61
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:45,070
but it's a foundational
skill and mindset that I

62
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:48,430
try to practice myself.
And this was a fantastic reminder there.

63
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,330
Just some really pithy,

64
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:54,070
actionable things that you can implement.
Uh,

65
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:58,340
and I would suggest that you
reflect on in journaling and so on.

66
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:02,540
Seth is the author of 17
bestselling books. He is at,

67
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,330
this is sets blog on Twitter.

68
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:08,140
They've been translated
into more than 35 languages.

69
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:12,280
He writes about the way ideas spread,
marketing, strategic quitting leadership,

70
00:04:12,281 --> 00:04:15,940
and most of all challenging the status
quo in all areas. His books include,

71
00:04:15,941 --> 00:04:19,480
and I'm sure many of you have read
more than one linchpin tribes,

72
00:04:19,481 --> 00:04:23,770
the dip purple cow, what to do when it's
your turn and it's always your turn.

73
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,650
He's founded companies.
His blog,

74
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,920
which you can find by typing Seth into
Google is one of the most popular in the

75
00:04:29,921 --> 00:04:30,670
world.

76
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:35,670
In 2013 he was inducted into the
direct marketing hall of fame and he is

77
00:04:36,961 --> 00:04:40,920
constantly shaking things
up and pushing the envelope,

78
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:44,330
testing the impossible.
Very, very brilliant guy.

79
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,120
And with all of that said,

80
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:50,910
please enjoy this round
two with Seth Goden.

81
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:56,300
Thanks Tim for having me.
What a pleasure to be back.

82
00:04:56,570 --> 00:05:01,310
I will start by pointing out
how uh, erudite, intelligent,

83
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:03,500
good looking,
generous and thoughtful.

84
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:07,400
Most of the people who
listen to this podcast are,

85
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:12,880
I was optimistic that as we dive through
these questions and as Tim continues to

86
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,910
long arc of what he's
trying to talk about,

87
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,940
people will see over and over again.

88
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,450
And then in an economy
based on connection,

89
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:28,990
real connection comes from people who
seek to contribute to the community first

90
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:35,660
and that that asset, the trust
that comes from that is priceless.

91
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,210
So looking through these questions,

92
00:05:38,211 --> 00:05:43,211
skipping the one about why I look like
a lizard and a few other questions that

93
00:05:43,221 --> 00:05:45,250
have to do with um,

94
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,850
what it was like to be in a movie
with James Franco who I've never met.

95
00:05:49,851 --> 00:05:51,860
So I've never been in a
movie with James Franco.

96
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:57,020
I find that there are a few groupings.
One gooping was,

97
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,650
uh,
talking about education and parenting.

98
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,310
Another grouping was the
mechanics of marketing.

99
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:09,640
And I would say the biggest grouping was
an understanding of the fear then each

100
00:06:10,401 --> 00:06:14,240
of us has to deal with in
order to do this original work.

101
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,530
I tried alphabetizing the questions
in grouping. I've failed at that.

102
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:23,620
So maybe what I'll do is go through
them and as they prompt other thoughts,

103
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,520
I'll weave those together.

104
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,480
So it started with a James Roelof
who kicked us off with a question.

105
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:33,800
What's the one thing that
most marketers do wrong?

106
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:39,290
And this is easy. We're
selfish. We are narcissists,

107
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:44,400
infant tile narcissists who believed
that our need for more and our desire for

108
00:06:45,111 --> 00:06:48,140
attention trumps everything else.

109
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:53,620
We justify and rationalize
our work and interrupt people,

110
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,820
spam people,

111
00:06:55,850 --> 00:07:00,560
yell at people to save people and playing
the short term game again and again.

112
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,453
And again,

113
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:06,320
successful marketers are successful
because they don't do that.

114
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:12,340
And it turns out that that scares the
folks who are willing to build a story

115
00:07:13,161 --> 00:07:14,000
that's true,

116
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:19,390
to earn permission to create a product
or service that spreads merely because

117
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:25,970
it's remarkable.
That mindset almost never shows up.

118
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:31,400
Next question from Paul Van [inaudible].
How do you build a tribe from scratch?

119
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:35,480
So the idea of tribes I think
is fundamental to humanity.

120
00:07:35,481 --> 00:07:37,850
It's been around for thousands
and thousands of years,

121
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:41,450
but in the modern world in which we live,

122
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:46,480
we can get confused because it might seem
that our job is to build a tribe from

123
00:07:47,421 --> 00:07:50,830
scratch, but most of the time
that's not what happened.

124
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:54,320
Nike did not invent the running tribe.

125
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:57,710
There were already runners
before Nike showed up.

126
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:03,020
Harley Davidson did not
invent the outside or tribe,

127
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:08,300
a group they called themselves the 1%
long before the other 1% showed up.

128
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:13,780
That what we do when we lead a tribe
often is we find people who are already

129
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,760
connected and we merely
show up to lead them.

130
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:24,170
And for most businesses, most
opportunities, we don't even lead them.

131
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,560
We merely serve as a
tribe that already exists.

132
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:32,300
So then when you find a group of people
who share an instinct and interest,

133
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:34,610
a connection, a leader, a goal,

134
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:40,010
and you give that group of
people something with which
they can take action to

135
00:08:40,011 --> 00:08:45,011
where I BVH that long sentence is
people like us do things like this.

136
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,210
Once you were able to say people
like us do things like this,

137
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:56,110
then you have found a tribe that
can revolve around what you do.

138
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,100
Switching over to the fear side,

139
00:08:59,101 --> 00:09:04,101
Jenny Western camp asked what limiting
self beliefs did I change in order to

140
00:09:04,171 --> 00:09:07,740
become successful and how
did I change them? Uh,

141
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,660
this was actually work
that I did on myself, uh,

142
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:16,710
in college and have tried to continue
doing and myself for a long time since

143
00:09:16,711 --> 00:09:20,490
then. The self limiting beliefs, in fact,

144
00:09:20,491 --> 00:09:24,450
all of us because all of
us like being competent,

145
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,630
we like being respected.
We like being successful.

146
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:32,340
And when something shows up that
threatens to undo all of those things,

147
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,340
well then it's really easy to avoid it.

148
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And what goes hand in hand
with that is the sour mindset.

149
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:44,070
The mindset of we're not
getting what we deserve.

150
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:49,200
The mindset of the world is not fair.
The mindset of why should I even bother?

151
00:09:49,201 --> 00:09:52,260
It's probably not going to work.
And one thing,

152
00:09:52,261 --> 00:09:56,820
those of us who were lucky enough to
live in a world where we have enough,

153
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,820
when we have a roof and we have food,
uh,

154
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:04,880
is we find ourselves caught in this cycle
of keeping track of the wrong things.

155
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,890
Keeping Track of how many
times we've been rejected,

156
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,200
keeping track of how many
times it didn't work,

157
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:15,440
keeping track of all the times someone
has broken our heart or double crossed us

158
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:20,280
or let us down. Of course, we can
keep track of those things, but why,

159
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,820
why keep track of them?
Are they making us better?

160
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,020
Wouldn't it make more sense to keep track
of the other stuff to keep track of it.
