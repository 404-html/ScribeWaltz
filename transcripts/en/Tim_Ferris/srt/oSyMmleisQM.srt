1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,810
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02,811 --> 00:00:06,150
I can run flat out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:08,133
No question.

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,420
I'm a cybernetic organism living tissue.

5
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:25,600
This episode is brought to you by wealth.
Front.

6
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,150
Wealth Front is the future
of financial advice.

7
00:00:28,151 --> 00:00:32,530
They become incredibly popular among my
friends in silicon valley and across the

8
00:00:32,531 --> 00:00:36,670
country because they provide the same
high end financial advice that the best

9
00:00:36,671 --> 00:00:38,980
private wealth managers deliver
it to the ultra wealthy,

10
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:43,330
but for any account size and at a
fraction of the cost. For instance,

11
00:00:43,331 --> 00:00:47,110
they monitor your portfolio every day
across more than a dozen asset classes to

12
00:00:47,111 --> 00:00:51,340
look for opportunities to rebalance
or harvest tax losses. Now,

13
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:55,840
would you do the same? Are you
doing the same? Probably not.

14
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:00,370
And the powers and the software wealth
front now manages more than $4 billion in

15
00:01:00,371 --> 00:01:03,310
assets,
which is up from around 2.5 billion.

16
00:01:03,311 --> 00:01:05,020
When they started
advertising on this podcast,

17
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,490
they're growing incredibly quickly. Unlike
old fashioned private wealth managers,

18
00:01:09,491 --> 00:01:11,830
wealth front is powered
by innovative technology,

19
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:16,570
making it the most tax efficient,
low cost, hassle free way to invest.

20
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,030
They don't have bloated sales
teams or retail locations,

21
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,800
so they can deliver all of this
sophisticated financial advice and these

22
00:01:23,801 --> 00:01:27,260
services at a fraction of the cost
of a traditional financial advisor.

23
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:28,400
So at the very least,

24
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:33,080
go to wealthfront.com forward slash
Tim and take their free risk assessment

25
00:01:33,081 --> 00:01:35,830
survey. It only takes a couple
of minutes and Wealthfront.

26
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,780
We'll recommend a personalized portfolio
of investments. In other words,

27
00:01:38,781 --> 00:01:41,150
they'll tell you exactly where
they would put your money.

28
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:43,190
So even if you don't use their service,

29
00:01:43,191 --> 00:01:46,280
you have a huge leg up and you have
additional information for making good

30
00:01:46,281 --> 00:01:47,114
decisions.

31
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:51,470
They use investment theory to automate
good financial behavior and decisions

32
00:01:51,471 --> 00:01:53,090
that people typically don't make,

33
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:58,330
but should so go to wealthfront.com
forward slash Tim to get your first 15 k

36
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,140
this episode is brought
to you by 99 designs.

37
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:13,040
I've used 99 designs for years for
all sorts of graphic design needs,

38
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,950
whether you need a logo, website,
book cover, anything else.

39
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:20,180
99 designs was created to make great
designs accessible to everyone and to make

40
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:24,140
the process of getting designs much,
much easier. So when I first started out,

41
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,940
for instance,
testing,

42
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,510
prototype covers and getting prototype
covers for the four hour body,

43
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,750
I want the contest drop. That is one
option. This is a great solution.

44
00:02:32,751 --> 00:02:36,530
If you're looking for fast affordable
design work and the ability to choose from

45
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:40,760
dozens of options risk-free.
Let's say you need something late night,

46
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:42,830
quick turnaround while
people in other time zones,

47
00:02:42,831 --> 00:02:46,400
other countries can also help you
solve that problem. Since then,

48
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:51,490
I've worked with 99 designs on a separate
path or a different option and uh,

49
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:57,740
that is the one to one project service.
So enact number of cases.

50
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,850
And I'll give you one example.

51
00:02:58,851 --> 00:03:02,740
When I wanted to create the cover
for my audio book, the Tao of Seneca,

52
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,210
this was a very important project to me.

53
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:07,480
I decided to use their one
to one project service.

54
00:03:07,481 --> 00:03:10,660
And with this service you can invite
a specific designer to your project,

55
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,711
agree on a price,

56
00:03:11,711 --> 00:03:14,320
and then work together until you're
satisfied and they allow you to iterate.

57
00:03:14,321 --> 00:03:18,010
And provide feedback and all of this
stuff and I haven't shared it yet,

58
00:03:18,011 --> 00:03:20,260
but we also got some incredibly good,

59
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:25,500
really some of the best illustrations
I've ever seen from using this one-to-one

60
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,840
project service with a handful of
different designers and illustrators.

61
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:29,674
It blew my mind.

62
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:34,390
99 designs makes this all very easy and
efficient so you can check out the Tao

63
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:38,830
of Seneca design and other work that I
and your fellow listeners for that matter

64
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:43,690
have done on 99
designs@ninetyninedesigns.com
forward slash Tim.

65
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,290
Again,
that's 99 designs.com forward slash Tim

66
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:50,871
little boys and girls.

67
00:03:50,871 --> 00:03:54,080
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to
another episode of the Tim Ferriss show.

68
00:03:54,081 --> 00:03:56,920
That is Molly chewing a bully stick,
otherwise known as bold,

69
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,300
fizzle in the background,
but you're not here for that.

70
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,770
You were here for what we do every
episode that is deconstruct world class

71
00:04:03,771 --> 00:04:08,360
performers, whether they are from the
worlds of business, sports, entertainment,

72
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:13,100
chess or otherwise, to tease out the
habits, routines, philosophies, beliefs,

73
00:04:13,101 --> 00:04:14,840
etc. That you can apply to your own life.

74
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:19,880
And this time around we have someone by
popular request who is perhaps all of

75
00:04:19,881 --> 00:04:22,670
those categories wrapped into one.
Adam Robinson.

76
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:27,200
Adam first appeared on this podcast in
the becoming the best version of you

77
00:04:27,201 --> 00:04:27,711
episode,

78
00:04:27,711 --> 00:04:32,711
which was number two 10 so episode
number 210 alongside Josh Waitzkin,

79
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:37,190
who is best known for chest
Jujitsu investing and Rameet Seti,

80
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:40,580
best known for personal
finance and entrepreneurship.
So we had this round table,

81
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,460
how do you end your year?
All sorts of great stuff came up,

82
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,170
so I encourage you to
listen to that as well.

83
00:04:45,171 --> 00:04:49,970
But this is a dedicated episode full
of Adams stories and life lessons.

84
00:04:49,971 --> 00:04:52,130
He came out to San Francisco
to spend time with me.

85
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:55,820
I wanted to learn from him
and that is how it came to be.

86
00:04:55,821 --> 00:05:00,020
Adam Robinson has made a lifelong study
of outflanking and outsmarting the

87
00:05:00,021 --> 00:05:00,800
competition.

88
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,430
He has a rated chess master who was
awarded a lifetime by the United States

89
00:05:04,431 --> 00:05:05,270
Chess Federation.

90
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:10,130
And as a teenager he was personally
mentored by Bobby Fischer in the 18 months

91
00:05:10,131 --> 00:05:11,840
leading up to his winning
the world championship.

92
00:05:11,841 --> 00:05:14,840
Bobby Fischer is considered by many to
be the best chess player who has ever

93
00:05:14,841 --> 00:05:17,690
lived.
Then in his first career,

94
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:22,040
Adam developed a revolutionary approach
to taking standardized tests as one of

95
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:26,150
the two original cofounders of the
Princeton Review, his paradigm breaking,

96
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:30,830
or as they say in publishing category
killing test prep book, the sat,

97
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:31,431
subtitle,

98
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:34,430
cracking the system is the only test
prep book ever do with become a New York

99
00:05:34,431 --> 00:05:38,600
Times bestseller. Then after selling
his interest in the Princeton Review,

100
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:42,620
Adam turned his attention in the early
nineties to the then emerging field of

101
00:05:42,621 --> 00:05:44,810
artificial intelligence
developing a program.

102
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:50,140
They could analyze texts and provide
human like commentary is a Jack of all

103
00:05:50,961 --> 00:05:55,040
trades, master of many. He was later
invited to join a well known quant fund.

104
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:59,750
Uh, we can get into that another but well
known quant fund to develop statistical

105
00:05:59,751 --> 00:06:00,584
trading models.

106
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:05,740
And since he's established himself as an
independent global macro advisor to the

107
00:06:06,531 --> 00:06:07,790
chief investment officers,

108
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:10,640
have a select group of the world's
most successful hedge funds and family

109
00:06:10,641 --> 00:06:11,690
offices.
So in other words,

110
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:16,990
he is brought in to give
advice to billionaires and
mega billionaires and beyond

111
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,220
in his spare time.
For instance,

112
00:06:20,221 --> 00:06:24,840
he's also become pen pals with Warren
Buffet and we dig into lots that he's

113
00:06:24,841 --> 00:06:28,830
learned from Warren. This is
a wide ranging conversation
with a lot of takeaways.

114
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,400
I hope you enjoy listening to it
as much as I enjoyed recording it.

115
00:06:32,401 --> 00:06:36,660
So without further ado, please enjoy
my conversation with Adam Robinson.

116
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:42,580
Adam. Good. Sarah, welcome back to
the show. Thanks for having me, Tim.

117
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:47,710
And we are sitting here
and constant Ferris on this
comfortable couch in viewing

118
00:06:47,711 --> 00:06:49,960
distance of my lovely dog,
Molly.

119
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:55,040
And we could start just about anywhere
we have a thousand topics we could

120
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:55,521
explore it.

121
00:06:55,521 --> 00:06:59,420
And I thought we'd start with an anecdote
that made an impression on me and I'd

122
00:06:59,421 --> 00:07:00,320
like to explore it a little bit.

123
00:07:00,321 --> 00:07:03,220
Could you talk about Warren
Buffett and his day planner

124
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:06,340
please? Huh. So, uh,

125
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,710
we were having dinner, 10 of us with, uh,

126
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:14,970
with Warren and he held up with the,

127
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:19,870
with great dramatic affect his day
planner for the year. And he said,

128
00:07:19,871 --> 00:07:23,230
time is the most precious thing I have.
He said,

129
00:07:23,231 --> 00:07:26,200
I'm going to show you how precious it is.
I'm going to show you my day planner.

130
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:27,780
And He,

131
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:32,780
so it's a little two inch by three
inch little booklet that you get at any

132
00:07:34,001 --> 00:07:35,530
stationery store for the year.

133
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:41,070
And he held it up for all of us and he
rift through it and every page was empty

134
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:48,120
and that was his day planner
for the year. So, so it's,

135
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,280
it's really important to,

136
00:07:49,281 --> 00:07:53,510
to warn that his time is
his most valuable asset.

137
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:58,850
And what does he do with all
that empty space? He reads
all day, everyday, all day,

138
00:07:58,851 --> 00:08:00,380
every day.
Reads,

139
00:08:00,381 --> 00:08:05,381
thinks and hunts for his next acquisition.

140
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:09,060
And so that's,
that's what he does with his time.

141
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:14,560
Does he think of himself as an investor
or an acquirer of businesses at this

142
00:08:16,451 --> 00:08:17,900
point in time? How do you think he, he

143
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,670
thinks of himself,
you know,

144
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,480
everyone calls him the world's greatest
investor and he's certainly the world's

145
00:08:23,481 --> 00:08:25,820
greatest something.
But I think he's,

146
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:30,880
he's is actually the world's greatest
builder of businesses and acquire of

147
00:08:31,401 --> 00:08:34,310
businesses. And so that's what
he does. He acquires a business,

148
00:08:34,311 --> 00:08:36,380
intends to hold it forever.
Let's,

149
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:40,760
let's talk about talking about investing
but take us a slightly different tack.

150
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:45,890
We were chatting over Thai food
a little bit about a book called,

151
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:49,320
and I'm Mike at titles slightly wrong,
but I believe it is a,

152
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:52,460
you can be a stock market genius.

153
00:08:52,461 --> 00:08:56,400
It's something along those lines
by Joel Greenblatt. Absolutely.

154
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,420
And that,

155
00:08:57,421 --> 00:09:02,040
that book had in him made an impression
on me and had an impact on me when I was

156
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,800
pretty young. I think I was a
little too young for it. Uh,

157
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,070
when I was around 16 or 17 and uh,

158
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:12,450
directly proceeded my first stock
purchase f ever, which was Pixar.

159
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:17,040
And uh, when I, when I met Joel
many, many, many years later,

160
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:18,450
this is probably just a few years ago,

161
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:23,750
he said that in some respects
people should read his books in the,

162
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:29,540
the reverse order of their publication
because the stock market genius book

163
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:35,890
really covers a lot of what some people
might consider event based investment or,

164
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:36,743
or training.

165
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,320
And I was wondering if you
had any thoughts you brought
up and I said, hey, let's,

166
00:09:40,321 --> 00:09:44,550
let's talk about it in the conversation
when we're recording. You mentioned,

167
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,990
yes you are familiar with,

168
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:50,430
with Joel and then also you
brought up Lynch Peter Lynch.

169
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:54,530
And so I'd love to just hear you expand
on what you're going to say, but I,

170
00:09:54,531 --> 00:09:56,730
I cut you off during dinner cause
I wanted to save it for this.

171
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:01,360
Right. So, so Peter Lynch one up on Wall
Street and, and uh, and Joel Greenblatt,

172
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,040
both brilliant investors,

173
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:07,920
both investing geniuses and, and uh, my,

174
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:12,980
my only concern about about empowering
individual investors is that when you

175
00:10:15,901 --> 00:10:18,200
invest as an individual,
you are entering the,

176
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:22,890
the fiercest Gladys tutorial
arena ever invented.

177
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:23,933
And uh,

178
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:28,860
you're competing with highly incentivized
participants around the world,

179
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,270
uh, who are out for your lunch
and going to eat it if you're, if,

180
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,830
if you don't have an edge.

181
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:40,260
So I just want to be sure that individual
investors, when they choose to do that,

182
00:10:40,261 --> 00:10:44,700
realize that it's, again,
a gladiatorial pit and a,

183
00:10:44,701 --> 00:10:47,430
and you need an edge when you invest.

184
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:53,130
So what is your take on then
say a lynch or a Greenblatt in,

185
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:54,340
in that capacity?

186
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:59,940
And I don't know if it was [inaudible]
who could have been elsewhere when

187
00:11:00,101 --> 00:11:01,870
there's a discussion about the edges,

188
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:05,770
the types of edges you could have and
one would be informational advantage.

189
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,010
One could be a analytical advantage.

190
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,710
Another could be say perhaps
a behavioral advantage.

191
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:16,090
And reading a lot about buffet, it seems
like at least one of his advantages,

192
00:11:16,091 --> 00:11:20,890
behavioral, he's very unemotionally it
seems like affected by market movements.

193
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,420
Absolutely.
Uh,

194
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:27,220
and can divorce himself emotionally
from these temporary ups and downs.

195
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,730
Um, but, uh,

196
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:33,780
do you have any particular observations
related to Peter or Joel is relates to

197
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,210
advantages,
edges or otherwise?

198
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:41,140
You know, it's, it's so funny and before
we go any further, you know, I, cause we,

199
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:45,850
this is so much more intimate
than a conversation than
we had at the 92nd street

200
00:11:45,851 --> 00:11:48,520
y in front of a thousand people. And, uh,

201
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:52,490
this is almost a like park or jumping,
um,

202
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:56,890
but a conversational version of that
where you leap from topic to topic,

203
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:01,280
not knowing where you're going.
Um, so the edge, Warren Buffet,

204
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:03,910
one of my favorite quotes
of Warren Buffet is, um,

205
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,870
if you're in a poker game for 30 minutes
and you don't know who the Patsy is,

206
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:12,040
you're the patsy.
And so you need an edge,

207
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:15,280
but you need to know that you
have an edge over the market.

208
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:20,050
And in terms of information
since, uh, 2000,

209
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,130
uh,
the,

210
00:12:21,131 --> 00:12:25,780
a sec published a regulation
FD fair disclosure.

211
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:30,550
So in a sense, everyone has access to
the same information at the same time.

212
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,710
So information edges are very,
very difficult,

213
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:37,300
especially with modern
technology and, and, uh, um, uh,

214
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:40,630
other resources.
So information edges are tough,

215
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:44,440
behavioral edges are really important.
And you said buffet,

216
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,230
he's completely unemotional.
So yes,

217
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:51,970
when everyone is panicking,
uh, is when he gets greedy.

218
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:57,040
In fact, Buffett said a buffet
articulated in one sentence, the,

219
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:02,770
uh, the secret to investing. And
uh, and that's, uh, he said that we,

220
00:13:02,771 --> 00:13:07,771
meaning he and Charlie Munger are
fearful when others are greedy and we are

221
00:13:11,981 --> 00:13:16,800
greedy only when others are fearful.
And so the secret to investing in, in,

222
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:20,830
uh, public securities is knowing when to
be afraid. And knowing when to be greedy.

223
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,490
So what I'd like to do in this,

224
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:29,260
in this American Ninja Warrior course
of conversational park core is maybe,

225
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:34,290
maybe take a step back really far back
and did discuss a few of the experiences

226
00:13:35,361 --> 00:13:40,180
of your childhood because I was not aware
that you had spent, was it two years,

227
00:13:40,181 --> 00:13:43,720
two and a half years and a half years,
yeah. In the hospital. When you were,

228
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:47,440
when you were a kid, could
you describe why that was the
case? What happened? Sure,

229
00:13:47,441 --> 00:13:52,000
sure. Well, it was a Blythedale children's
hospital, which was started in, in um,

230
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:56,800
wow, I think in the forties
by Eleanor Roosevelt. And uh,

231
00:13:56,830 --> 00:14:00,910
it was for children with
longterm congenital illnesses
and I had a bone disease.

232
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,980
And uh, back then, uh,

233
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:08,130
the only way to cure it to was to put
you in a bed and wait for the disease to

234
00:14:08,201 --> 00:14:12,940
kind of run its course. And so, um, I
don't know if you remember Forrest Gump.

235
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,460
I did the beginning.
He had those leg braces.

236
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,980
So between the ages of
four and six and a half,

237
00:14:17,981 --> 00:14:21,640
I was wearing those leg braces in a
bed in the children's hospital. Yeah.

238
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:25,360
So what was,
what was your childhood like?

239
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:31,660
Ah, when, where did you grow up? It's,
so I grew up, I was born in New York,

240
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:35,320
uh,
and then was put in the hospital.

241
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,210
And then when I got out we moved
to, um, to Chicago, to Evanston,

242
00:14:40,211 --> 00:14:44,830
Illinois, which sort of Northwestern
is. So if you've seen any of the movies,

243
00:14:44,831 --> 00:14:48,180
like Ferris Bueller's day off
for home alone was raw, filmed,

244
00:14:48,181 --> 00:14:52,010
and within a mile of where
I grew up. So that was, that

245
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:55,190
was the where, what would you
in debt if you were to paint,

246
00:14:55,191 --> 00:14:59,510
because we talked a little bit about
in the last episode, Princeton Review.

247
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,080
Yeah. And we talked about that
chapter of your life in part,

248
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:09,010
but what were some of the formative
influences in your life up to say,

249
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:14,510
end of high school influences or
events, anything like that. You know,

250
00:15:14,511 --> 00:15:15,500
being in the hospital

251
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,720
for two and a half years
as you're growing up, you,

252
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:23,010
you get divorced from your body
in a hospital bed and, and you,

253
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,740
you get divorced from the world.

254
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:28,460
The world is something out there that
you can't touch and you can't participate

255
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:31,850
in and you,
but you observe it and you think about it.

256
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:33,283
And,
um,

257
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:38,060
I guess one of the format of influences
was, was a meeting Bobby Fischer, um,

258
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:39,403
was my hero.

259
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,690
How did you meet Bobby Fischer?

260
00:15:40,691 --> 00:15:43,360
And for those people who don't
know who Bobby Fischer is,

261
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:45,540
how would you encapsulate?
Ah,

262
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49,520
Fisher is said by some to be the
greatest chess player of all time.

263
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:53,630
And I met him right before he won the
world championship and knew him right

264
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,880
through the world championship.
And then

265
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:01,460
sadly afterwards he began
to lose his mind, uh, to,

266
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:05,870
to paranoia and died in 2007,
uh,

267
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:10,460
sad. Um, but I knew him at the height of
his powers right before he won the world

268
00:16:10,461 --> 00:16:14,930
championship. And, uh, it's
funny. Hi, I met him. He, um,

269
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:19,340
freshman year when I was in high school,
uh,

270
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:23,870
somebody beat me in a game of chess in
homeroom, beat me in like five most,

271
00:16:23,871 --> 00:16:25,280
like I knew how the pieces moved,

272
00:16:25,281 --> 00:16:29,030
but that was the extent of my knowledge
and this self frustrated me. I thought,

273
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:32,420
okay, I'm going to challenge them a
game the next day. And he beat me again.

274
00:16:32,421 --> 00:16:35,830
In fact, he beat me every day
that week. So I resolved that. Um,

275
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,940
I would study this game,
uh,

276
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:43,190
and just in order to beat this kid by the
end of the year, that was my sole goal.

277
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,950
And uh, cause I was really into
swimming at the time, you know,

278
00:16:45,951 --> 00:16:48,830
something four or five hours
a day, six, seven days a week.

279
00:16:48,831 --> 00:16:53,390
And chess was really much a sideline
for me. But I got into the game and,

280
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,980
and I,
I decided to go to the library,

281
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:00,410
actually a bookstore and get a chest book.

282
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:04,760
And the only book that they had was a
book called my 60 memorable games by Bobby

283
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,560
Fischer.
And at the time,

284
00:17:06,561 --> 00:17:09,710
this was four years before he
would win the world championship.

285
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:14,630
So I played over these games every
night there's 60 games and I realized,

286
00:17:14,631 --> 00:17:18,830
but wait a second, he's played hundreds
of games. So I went to the library.

287
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:23,480
This is pre Internet for those of you
millennials who don't know what a library

288
00:17:23,481 --> 00:17:27,910
is. And uh, and I, I got one,

289
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,650
it was the slow version of the Internet.
Yeah. This lowers and or the Internet.

290
00:17:30,651 --> 00:17:34,370
Yes. When you actually had to
look up things yourself. And um,

291
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:38,210
I went through 20 years of
back issues of chess magazines,

292
00:17:38,211 --> 00:17:42,740
laboriously every chest magazine that I
could find in the world and went through

293
00:17:42,741 --> 00:17:46,340
page by page. And if I found a
fissure game, I would write it down.

294
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,640
So I compiled my own notebook of 700
of his games that he had played and I

295
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:55,800
played over these games for two,
three years and I knew them by heart.

296
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,260
When you say played over,
yes.

297
00:17:58,261 --> 00:18:01,850
Does that mean you would set up a board
or did you do this in your head and you

298
00:18:01,851 --> 00:18:06,810
would go move by, move through
both players? Exactly. Decisions.

299
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:09,620
Exactly. If you do it on a
board, not a board. Yes. Um,

300
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:12,030
some people could do it in their heads.
I mean,

301
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:17,220
you'd like Magnus Carlsen World Champ,
uh, or Josh Waitzkin, our buddy,

302
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:22,260
uh, they can do it in their head.
I had to use a board. And, um,

303
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,800
so, so I remember it was, um, my,

304
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:30,860
I was 16 years old with my mother on
Easter Sunday and a visiting her in New

305
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:35,850
York and we were walking up sixth
avenue towards Central Park,

306
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:38,700
beautiful April Day.

307
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:43,650
And I'm across the street
across sixth avenue,

308
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:48,750
right in front of Macy's. I saw Bobby
Fischer. So imagine this was my hero.

309
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:50,040
Right.
And again,

310
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:53,820
this was a year and a half before he would
win the world championship. And again,

311
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:58,200
for those of you don't know that it
would be like spotting bigfoot or,

312
00:18:58,201 --> 00:19:02,600
I mean he was, or JD Salinger Baga sure.
Right. Right. Back in the day. And um,

313
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:08,340
so I said, mom, I, I know I, I said I
would spend today with you, but that's,

314
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:12,810
that's Bobby Fisher over the, I'll see
you later. So I had to cross traffic.

315
00:19:12,811 --> 00:19:15,750
I ran up to him and I,
I said that Mr. Fisher,

316
00:19:15,751 --> 00:19:20,751
Mr. Fisher in 1962 when you were playing
with Shefsky and the US championship,

317
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,640
you know,
cause I had years of,

318
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:28,590
of questions for him and I knew
all his games by heart and he just,

319
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:32,230
and he was, by the way, he
was a notorious reckless,

320
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:36,390
he had maybe two friends in
the entire world. And uh,

321
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:40,050
and he just looked at me kind of bemused
because I knew his games so well and he

322
00:19:40,051 --> 00:19:44,160
said, well, I dunno, we're
going, I'm going to lunch. You
want to join me? And I said,

323
00:19:44,161 --> 00:19:45,630
sure. Of course. Like right.

324
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,530
And that was the beginning of a friendship
that lasted two and a half years.

325
00:19:49,531 --> 00:19:54,090
It actually stretched beyond that, but
after the world championship. But I,

326
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:58,770
I fell out of touch with them for about
a dozen years because he fell off the

327
00:19:58,771 --> 00:20:01,380
map, the map where it doesn't
yours. So you met him, you,

328
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:06,210
how old were you at the time? He said 16
he was 28. 16 yeah. What was that first?

329
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:09,930
What was that first lunch like
if, I mean fantastic. I mean,

330
00:20:09,931 --> 00:20:14,790
imagine you're meeting your hero that
no one gets to talk to. And here he is,

331
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:19,490
I'm inviting you to lunch.
I mean a fantastic, and uh,

332
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:24,240
I wish I realized at the time how,
how lucky I was and uh,

333
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:25,590
but I wasn't thinking about that.

334
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:30,430
I was only thinking about him
and his chess games and, and uh,

335
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,360
I remember talking with him
and people don't know. I mean,

336
00:20:33,361 --> 00:20:37,010
I think of chess players
as um, you know, uh,

337
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:41,970
intellectual nerds and
very, uh, I'm not athletic,

338
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:46,670
but he was built like a, an Olympic
athlete. He was six, three, um, um,

339
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:51,810
an eight, literally two meals over
lunch, like two simultaneous meals,

340
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,670
two simultaneous meals. He just
demolished. Uh, again, um, uh,

341
00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:00,670
and when I say an Olympic athlete, I don't
mean like a power lifter. He was, uh,

342
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,970
like a, like a, an American football
player I just for, but very lean and um,

343
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,350
had incredible, uh, energy when we walked
down the street. Again, I'm five, eight,

344
00:21:11,351 --> 00:21:16,150
he's six, four, he towered over me
and walk with these huge strides.

345
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:18,280
I mean you have incredible power,
you know,

346
00:21:18,281 --> 00:21:21,010
and the amazing thing
about Fisher was that,

347
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:25,000
and I don't think this has ever
been done in the history before,

348
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,060
he was entirely self taught.

349
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:32,980
He learned the game at the age of six
and then decided to take on the Russians

350
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,370
for whom chess was their national sport.

351
00:21:36,371 --> 00:21:41,371
It was proof of their superiority during
the height of the Cold War and single

352
00:21:41,381 --> 00:21:45,430
handedly beat them at their own game.
He had no coaches, no nothing, um,

353
00:21:45,431 --> 00:21:49,690
and did it all on his own.
And a remarkable,

354
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,830
remarkable guy. We all, we, we,

355
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,840
I remember debating Motown songs with him.
Um,

356
00:21:56,050 --> 00:22:00,190
we were at a diner, um, and we had,

357
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,240
we had dollars between us,

358
00:22:01,241 --> 00:22:06,241
but we had no coins and they just have
these little juke boxes at each dining

359
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:10,540
table that you put in a quarter
and you have three songs.

360
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:11,860
We had a quarter between us.

361
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:16,240
And so we were debating which three
songs we were going to choose.

362
00:22:16,241 --> 00:22:19,780
He loved Motown and so did I. So, uh,

363
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,900
I can't remember which songs we picked,
but I remember doing that with him.

364
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:28,170
How did that first lunch turn
into an ongoing relationship?

365
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:34,860
And maybe a better question to be to
what happened at in the last half or

366
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,000
quarter of that meal that led to a second
meeting. You can tackle it either way.

367
00:22:40,001 --> 00:22:42,670
I'm just so curious because
people have these opportunities,

368
00:22:42,671 --> 00:22:44,310
these golden opportunities,
right?

369
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:48,760
And then they're not able to capitalize
on them or it's a flash in the pan.

370
00:22:48,761 --> 00:22:52,460
They have a great single story, but that
turned into an ongoing relationship. Why,

371
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,050
why?

372
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:58,050
Because I was totally focused on him
and that it never occurred to me when I

373
00:22:59,081 --> 00:23:02,440
first approached him that he
would say, get lost kid. Um,

374
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,560
I just had questions and,

375
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:09,190
and he was my hero and it
was entirely innocent and,

376
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:13,960
and, and I'd done my homework. I
knew his games better than he did.

377
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:19,250
So I remember talking about games and
we played hundreds of games of speech

378
00:23:19,251 --> 00:23:19,840
chess.

379
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,370
And so imagine playing pickup basketball
and you're a very good basketball

380
00:23:24,371 --> 00:23:28,780
player, but you're playing with, you know,
Coby Bryant or more or, or curry, right?

381
00:23:28,781 --> 00:23:31,300
I mean, what one of the grades? And, um,

382
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:36,750
and I remember I would play his moves
against him because I knew all of his

383
00:23:36,761 --> 00:23:40,930
games by heart and then he would correct
me. Like he would say, I'd say, Oh,

384
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:45,680
I don't understand why he played that
because you said black is better in your

385
00:23:45,681 --> 00:23:50,180
book. And he said, I did. I said,
yeah you did. And he said, oh,

386
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:53,350
I was wrong. It's better
and crushed me. Um,

387
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,510
and so it was a,

388
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:01,340
I think it was just because I knew it
was games so well I'd done my homework.

389
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:05,120
And, and I think the lesson
for, for everyone is,

390
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,420
is it if you've done your homework to,
to,

391
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:11,220
to be focused on the other person,
um,

392
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,960
and not your fears and reservations and,
and uh,

393
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:17,000
and uh,
yeah.

394
00:24:17,001 --> 00:24:21,170
So in terms of continuing the relationship
focused on them in the sense of being

395
00:24:21,171 --> 00:24:24,530
curious about them as opposed to
worrying what they're thinking about you.

396
00:24:24,531 --> 00:24:27,890
Exactly. Totally focused on them. And, um,

397
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,760
it's interesting cause he would
then reflect it back on me.

398
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:35,660
So the next year when he was
preparing for the Spassky match,

399
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:39,320
am I got to spend two weeks with them
Spassky these world championships for the

400
00:24:39,321 --> 00:24:43,670
world championship right now you'd think
if there was any time that he wanted to

401
00:24:43,671 --> 00:24:45,710
be alone, it was like preparing
for the oil change it. But I,

402
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,170
he invited me to spend
two weeks of them at a,

403
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:53,200
at gross singers and of gross singers at
the time was a resort in the Catskills.

404
00:24:53,421 --> 00:24:57,170
And uh,
Muhammad Ali used to train there and uh,

405
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:02,450
so they invited Fisher to train for the
Spassky match and I got to spend a week

406
00:25:02,451 --> 00:25:04,860
with him, uh, sorry,
two weeks with him at a,

407
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:10,090
they're all alone and watched him
prepare for the Spassky match,

408
00:25:11,481 --> 00:25:13,920
which was really fascinating.
So he,

409
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:17,360
he play over games studying and then
he would turn to me and say, well,

410
00:25:17,361 --> 00:25:21,230
what would you do here? And I said,
and when you say play over games,

411
00:25:21,231 --> 00:25:24,500
and I apologize because I
wouldn't consider myself a
chess player, but sure, sure.

412
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,170
That means that he's sitting
in front of a board by himself.

413
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:33,680
He's sitting over a board by himself.
Well with me, I'm sitting next to him,

414
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:34,460
uh,

415
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:38,600
or rather across the table from him and
he's got a full chessboard and a book of

416
00:25:38,601 --> 00:25:42,020
Spassky his games. It was
a red book, like 600 games.

417
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,300
And just as I did with Fischer's games,

418
00:25:44,301 --> 00:25:48,080
he had a little red book of Spassky
these Games and he just played over these

419
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:49,063
over and over.

420
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:54,340
And it was really fascinating and I don't
think people realized Fisher conducted

421
00:25:55,340 --> 00:26:00,050
the longest con in sports history,

422
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:05,180
a long con. And, and uh, if you're
not sure what a long con is, I mean,

423
00:26:05,181 --> 00:26:09,740
I know you know Tim but, but uh, for,
for listeners along con is a, is a,

424
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:11,850
is a,
um,

425
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:17,530
is when a confidence man sets you
up and the payoff is years away,

426
00:26:18,261 --> 00:26:20,360
not like later that day.

427
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:23,600
And so official when he was growing up,

428
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:28,370
played always pawn to king
for his, his first move, and,

429
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:33,680
and, and had a very limited opening
repertoire in terms of, in football terms.

430
00:26:33,681 --> 00:26:38,681
He had a very limited playbook and he
always played the same opening moves and

431
00:26:38,871 --> 00:26:43,871
he defied the Russians and defied
the world to beat him by essentially,

432
00:26:44,191 --> 00:26:48,240
he's giving, here's my playbook, these
are my opening moves. Do your best.

433
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:53,660
And so from the age of 12
till the age of 29 when he,

434
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:59,640
right, so this is 17 years, he played
exactly the same opening moves.

435
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:05,150
And what was curious for me was that
when I was with him about a month before

436
00:27:05,671 --> 00:27:09,780
the two, sorry, two months before the
match began, I noticed he was playing,

437
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:14,500
studying games outside is
opening repertoire. And I,

438
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:18,210
I asked him, I said, Bobby, what are
you like, why are sending those games?

439
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:23,040
And he just kind of smiled. Cryptically
um, and uh, he said, I dunno,

440
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:27,360
we'll see. And, and sure enough
against Spassky. Now mind you,

441
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:32,960
Spassky was supported by the
Russian chess machine, right?

442
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:38,090
Dozens of the world's top
players were all Russian. Uh,

443
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:42,270
who were supplying Spassky with
analysis of all of fishers,

444
00:27:42,271 --> 00:27:43,320
old games,

445
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,820
but then he played an entirely
new opening repertoire.

446
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:51,300
He set them up for 17 years. He said,
these are the moves I'm going to play.

447
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,530
So imagine it'd be like a,

448
00:27:53,531 --> 00:27:58,531
a box or always backed by leading with
his right hand and then all of a sudden

449
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,410
he's leading with his left and
they didn't know what to do.

450
00:28:01,411 --> 00:28:04,820
They were totally flummoxed, dread pirate
Roberts and the princess bride. Oh,

451
00:28:04,821 --> 00:28:08,670
that I'm not lefthanded yeah. Out
of those. That's exactly right.

452
00:28:08,671 --> 00:28:11,010
The princess bride.
I a cane.

453
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:15,210
If we're talking about
her yesterday and what,

454
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:20,070
what are some of the other things that
you observed about Fisher or learned from

455
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:25,290
Fisher? Does anything come to mind? He
was very childlike. Um, very simple.

456
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:29,970
Um, in his analysis of,
of the Games, you know,

457
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,980
Oliver Wendell Holmes,
one of my favorite quotes is he said,

458
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:40,130
I wouldn't give anything for the
simplicity on this side of complexity,

459
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,340
but I'd give my life for the simplicity
on the far side of complexity.

460
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:48,960
And Fisher was the simplicity
on the far side of complexity.

461
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:53,850
It was the informed simplicity, not the
uninformed yes, like Picasso. You know,

462
00:28:53,851 --> 00:28:58,500
it's funny, I always dismissed Picasso
is a painter. Not that I'm an art expert.

463
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:02,010
Um, but it's only when you,
when you see his paintings as a,

464
00:29:02,011 --> 00:29:05,280
as a 16 year old and he's
painting like Rembrandt.

465
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:08,520
So when he went over and,
and Eh,

466
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:12,810
as an adult and started painting like
a child, it was an informed simplicity.

467
00:29:12,811 --> 00:29:16,200
It was a choice. Um, and
Fisher was like that.

468
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:20,970
In what other ways did the
childlike nature manifests itself?

469
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:26,190
Isn't Doozy, ASM? Um, always he was
enthusiastic about everything, uh,

470
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,890
in the way that he
explained things. Like, um,

471
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:34,170
I remember once we were looking at a
position on the board and he had, again,

472
00:29:34,171 --> 00:29:38,140
he was six [inaudible] four. He
was a normous and he, he, he, he,

473
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:43,120
he's trying to teach me a lesson about
the position of chess pieces on the board.

474
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:46,540
And he held his hand over a
few pieces and he said, if,

475
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:51,310
if your pieces can move outside of
your hand, they're too far apart.

476
00:29:51,311 --> 00:29:55,900
They're not well coordinated. Like
it was a physical, an intuitive,

477
00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:01,900
mm. Uh, encapsulation of
a very profound principle,

478
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:04,260
um, that, uh, the,

479
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:07,240
the illustrated again
physically with his hand,

480
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:11,650
your pieces move outside your
hand. Uh, the, the too far apart.

481
00:30:11,651 --> 00:30:15,160
They can't coordinate and you're like,
do you mean your size?

482
00:30:15,161 --> 00:30:20,050
Pancake my little head. Right, exactly.

483
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:23,280
Um, yeah cause he's hand
privately is half the board. Um,

484
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:29,650
yeah. So, so, um, so that, that's
how genius manifests itself. Uh,

485
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:32,380
as, as, as a child like simplicity.

486
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,100
What are other,

487
00:30:35,101 --> 00:30:40,101
if there are other essences of
genius in your mind because you,

488
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,560
you and we talked about this a bit in the
first episode and I'm sure we'll touch

489
00:30:43,561 --> 00:30:47,220
on this in a few different
ways in this conversation,

490
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:52,260
but you have been successful
in many different worlds
and you've met many people

491
00:30:52,261 --> 00:30:56,930
who are geniuses in different domains.
So s aside from this,

492
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:58,080
okay.

493
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,930
Childlike simplicity that is on
the other side of complexity.

494
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,840
What are other essences of

495
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:06,260
genius in your mind?

496
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:12,280
I think the American
psychologist Maslow said,

497
00:31:13,261 --> 00:31:16,410
if your only tool is a hammer,

498
00:31:16,411 --> 00:31:18,570
you view every problem is a nail.

499
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:22,230
And I would flip that
and say that if you're,

500
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:26,730
the geniuses have very limited tool sets.

501
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:32,040
They have a hammer and they're
geniuses in looking for nails,

502
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:37,380
right? That's their genius, right?
They have a very limited skill set. Um,

503
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:42,090
but they, they master it and apply
it incredibly well. You know,

504
00:31:42,091 --> 00:31:46,980
I'm reminded, uh, of the,
of the movie karate kid,

505
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:51,810
right? Or is wax on, wax
off, um, you know, uh, uh,

506
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:56,440
sand a floor. Right? And then he
had that crane kicky move. Yeah.

507
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,850
And he won the California State
Championship on the base of those three.

508
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:04,700
And I'm goofing here on, on, on,
on, on, um, on the karate kid. But,

509
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:08,100
but I think it illustrates
a, a, a profound point to,

510
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:12,960
to master a few skills.
Well and,

511
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:17,350
and then look for domains when you
can apply those skills and stay out of

512
00:32:17,351 --> 00:32:20,710
everything else. Warren Buffett does
the same thing with [inaudible].

513
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:24,250
I was going to ask you, and, uh,
then, then I want to come back to you,

514
00:32:24,251 --> 00:32:25,810
but in the case of say a buffet,

515
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:31,060
what are his wax on wax off,
crane kick, etc. What is his,

516
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,090
what are his primary,
uh,

517
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:39,610
superpowers and how much
are they neat versus

518
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:45,410
developed or acquired? Maybe
there's a better way to put
it. Right. Well, you know,

519
00:32:45,411 --> 00:32:50,060
the, one of the great partnerships
of all time was, was, uh,

520
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:54,380
Charlie monger and, and, and
uh, and Warren Buffet and, um,

521
00:32:55,730 --> 00:33:00,530
and, and, and the two of them spend all
their time just reading and just looking.

522
00:33:00,531 --> 00:33:03,440
And I, and by the way, other
great ambassadors like Sam's,
I'll do the same thing.

523
00:33:03,441 --> 00:33:05,990
They spent all their time on the prowl,

524
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,950
the prowl for ideas or
prowl for businesses.

525
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,140
Are they reading primarily filings?

526
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:16,130
Are they reading far ranging
books on different subjects,

527
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,380
on everything,
on everything?

528
00:33:18,381 --> 00:33:20,540
You just don't know where you're
going to get your next idea.

529
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:24,680
Not so much filings I'm in. They would
look, read those two, of course. Um,

530
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:28,430
but read far and wide because you just
don't know where you're going to get your

531
00:33:28,431 --> 00:33:31,300
next investment idea. And, um,

532
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,760
I think that's one of
their superpowers. And, uh,

533
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:39,940
and the other is a longterm
focus with the buffet and Munger.

534
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,720
So, um, when everyone is
panicking say, and in, in, uh,

535
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:49,040
2007 when the world seems to be imploding,

536
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:52,730
they're eagerly looking
for, for values. Um,

537
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:57,940
so they invest for the long haul and they
don't get distracted by vicissitudes,

538
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:04,730
economic or, or otherwise. Um,

539
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:10,280
you mentioned, so I'm going to go
back to you in the library. Sure.

540
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:15,210
All right. You're going through hundreds
of games and taking notes. Yeah.

541
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:20,360
On the Bobby or going through years back,
he was a magazines sure.

542
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:25,370
And taking down all the
Fisher Games. Yeah, I would
imagine. It's all I did. Right.

543
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:25,741
So I'm not,

544
00:34:25,741 --> 00:34:29,870
I'm imagining there were not many kids in
your class or your school who did this.

545
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,540
So the question is,

546
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:39,370
what do you think your core strengths
are and what are some of the core

547
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:44,930
strengths you've developed that you
didn't have at, at a young age, right,

548
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:48,740
or weaknesses that you have have overcome?
Well,

549
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:50,420
I always look for,

550
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:55,280
and we talked about this at the 92nd
street y for things that don't make sense.

551
00:34:55,610 --> 00:35:00,170
I look for patterns. Um,
I look for, for quirks,

552
00:35:00,171 --> 00:35:04,340
even in my own mind. Uh, I
remember, let's see how old I was,

553
00:35:04,341 --> 00:35:07,760
nine years old and I was
listening to Ms. Callahan,

554
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:12,750
who is my teacher and I was in love
with her and she was using, she, she,

555
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,570
she,
she was talking about something again,

556
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:16,630
I was just totally in
love with her and I don't,

557
00:35:16,631 --> 00:35:21,470
I forgot what she was talking about,
but she, she's spoken and I realized,

558
00:35:21,471 --> 00:35:25,190
she spoke the word of and I realized,

559
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:30,740
Oh, I don't know how to spell that
word. Now what was fascinating is,

560
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:35,450
I mean I had learned how to read when
I was five and in the hospital. Um,

561
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:40,560
but I was stunned that I didn't
know how to spell a two letter word.

562
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:45,950
And so I spent the rest of the
day trying to spell the word of,

563
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,650
and this is the way it did it. My
job is nine years old. I said, okay.

564
00:35:49,651 --> 00:35:52,350
I knew the first letter was a vowel.

565
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:56,070
So on a sheet of paper
I wrote a e, I, O, u.

566
00:35:56,130 --> 00:36:00,660
And then I wrote why cause sometimes wise.
And then I wrote all the consonants,

567
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,700
right, B, c, d and so on.

568
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:07,980
And I spent the rest of the day going
through every possible pattern, like a B,

569
00:36:07,981 --> 00:36:11,700
and it's an APP is that of okay,
that's not, and then a c and a d.

570
00:36:11,701 --> 00:36:15,720
And I went through every single
permutation trying to find the word of,

571
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:20,490
and um, I never found it because
of his is not a, uh, it's not,

572
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:24,390
it's not phonetic stuff. Another gay
phonetic, a tough language that way. Yes.

573
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:27,100
I didn't realize that at the age of nine.
Yeah.

574
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:29,930
But I think that was one
of my core strengths, uh,

575
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:34,590
looking for patterns and things that don't
make sense and being amused by my own

576
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:38,460
mind and failings. And, um, but I,

577
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:42,410
I can I interject for a second? For sure.
You can. Why do you, whenever you win,

578
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:47,130
why didn't you ask how to spell it as
opposed to going through that exercise?

579
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,800
Because I,
I wanted to,

580
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:53,790
because the real question was
why I couldn't spell it. Not,

581
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:58,200
not what is the answer,
what is the answer?

582
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,900
And it's such an important thing,
you know.

583
00:37:00,901 --> 00:37:05,760
Thank you for bringing that up because
the questions you ask about the world

584
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:08,790
determine the success you,
you, you get in the world.

585
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:11,250
And one of my favorite
questions is Tony Robbins. Uh,

586
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,190
what would you do if you
knew you couldn't fail? And,

587
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:17,430
and so the questions we
ask are, are, are key.

588
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:21,520
So I wasn't interested in the answer how
to, how to spell the word of, I mean, I,

589
00:37:21,521 --> 00:37:24,240
I knew that was trivial.
I knew it was a two letter word,

590
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:28,530
but what wasn't trivial is
that I couldn't spell it.

591
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:32,670
Why do you think that is?
Because that's an odd, that is,

592
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:36,660
it strikes me as very unusual that
you would have learned to read,

593
00:37:36,661 --> 00:37:38,370
but then four years,
three,

594
00:37:38,371 --> 00:37:41,850
four years later would have this word
that sticks out as something that you

595
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,460
couldn't spell away. It was
just one. It was one second.

596
00:37:44,461 --> 00:37:47,790
I knew it was the way you can
forget somebody's, you know,

597
00:37:47,791 --> 00:37:49,960
the name of vernacular in
a movie or something. Like,

598
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:54,610
I knew it was a momentary glitch, but
I was, I was fascinated by it. And,

599
00:37:54,611 --> 00:37:58,470
and looking back on it, I was, I'm
fascinated that the age of nine, I, I,

600
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,760
I was very systematic.

601
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,690
I had two columns and spent the rest of
the day ignoring Ms. Callahan and the

602
00:38:03,691 --> 00:38:07,410
rest of the class since I spent
most of my time daydreaming anyway.

603
00:38:07,411 --> 00:38:11,040
And she would just let me trying to
figure out how to spell the word of very

604
00:38:11,041 --> 00:38:14,640
systematically and that, and I thought
that was a good use of my time.

605
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:19,080
You mentioned questions and uh,

606
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:24,030
love to ask you because I
think they're related. You can,

607
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,500
you can place this at any time.

608
00:38:25,501 --> 00:38:28,380
We're going to jump around
chronologically because that's our core.

609
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:32,970
That's park court. Never
know what, what's, what, uh,
obstacles coming up next.

610
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,100
Yeah. Decision making. What

611
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:41,100
is your decision making process for
choosing opportunities or your criteria or

612
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:48,570
how do you think about
choosing opportunities or
more so than finding when you

613
00:38:48,881 --> 00:38:53,080
have
a number of different opportunities,

614
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:55,060
a number of different
paths you could go down.

615
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:58,540
What is your decision making
process or your selection process?

616
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:02,750
The problem is I'm so intellectually
curious that I really have to be careful

617
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,980
cause it's, it's going
down a rabbit hole. Um,

618
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:09,560
I'm going to have to limit the things
that I allow myself to be interested in.

619
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:15,080
And, uh, I think I choose
the one that's the most fun.

620
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:19,790
And, and, and I guess my
life is like par Corp Right.

621
00:39:19,791 --> 00:39:23,840
Just jumping in and, and,
and, and knowing that Joel,

622
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:28,430
be resourceful than and land on your
feet and then be able to jump from there

623
00:39:28,431 --> 00:39:32,960
too. So, um, I look also for,

624
00:39:32,961 --> 00:39:36,500
for for areas that we touched on this,
the ball bearings principle, right.

625
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:42,520
For opportunities with things that
people haven't explored before and uh,

626
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,970
or they've explored the death and they,
they're no longer interested.

627
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:51,560
And so I tried to look for things
with, uh, with fresh eyes. Yeah.

628
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:54,900
And for the ball bearing spokes
we could go into it, but we,

629
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:57,570
we spent quite a bit of time on it.
And in the first episode of that,

630
00:39:57,571 --> 00:39:58,860
I'm so you guys can explore that there.

631
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:02,680
I'd like to talk about post Fisher.

632
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,930
Where'd you go to college?

633
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:10,000
I went to Wharton Undergrad and then
I got a lot of great Oxford. Hmm.

634
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:15,500
And how did you choose
Oxford? And then, then,

635
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:20,170
then we're going to talk about
apples. Ah, Oh yes, yes. Apples.

636
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:24,670
I Granny Smith apples.
Okay. I chose Oxford. My, I,

637
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,470
you know,
my,

638
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:30,470
my father died when I was 19 and I was
pretty lost and I could have finished

639
00:40:30,731 --> 00:40:35,020
Wharton in, in, in two years. Um, um,

640
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:40,090
two and a half years anyway, cause it's,
it takes six or seven courses a term.

641
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:43,190
And, uh, cause I, I found
everything really interesting.

642
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:47,980
And you were only required to take
four, take six or seven. And, um,

643
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,070
my father died and I,
I didn't know what to do and I,

644
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:56,250
I wanted to get away and I don't speak
any foreign language fluently enough to,

645
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,330
to go to a country other than like,
say England.

646
00:41:01,331 --> 00:41:05,890
So I chose Oxford and I thought law would
be an interesting way to beguile. Um,

647
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:09,110
a couple of years, two,
three years. So, uh,

648
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:12,550
was kind of a default actually.
And, and while I was there,

649
00:41:12,551 --> 00:41:16,150
I spent most of my time taking
dance classes in London. Um,

650
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:20,570
hip hop dancing in London.
Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. I,

651
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:23,300
I only,
I was the,

652
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:28,740
not the most conscientious law
student at Oxford. Um, but,

653
00:41:28,741 --> 00:41:31,030
uh, but anyways, so that's
what I did. Yeah. If

654
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,020
you don't mind me asking, we don't
have to get into it if you don't want,

655
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:34,940
but how did your,
how did your dad pass?

656
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:36,810
I,
he took his life

657
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:43,110
and he suffered from depression as I did.
And,

658
00:41:43,111 --> 00:41:45,660
uh, uh, you know,

659
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:51,420
I remember the last thing
he said to me before, before
he did, so, um, he said, uh,

660
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:56,130
you know, I'll always remember that
you did everything on your own.

661
00:41:56,790 --> 00:42:01,290
And I didn't realize that he was
using past tense then. Right. He said,

662
00:42:01,291 --> 00:42:04,100
I'll always remember that you did
everything on your own. This was the law.

663
00:42:04,101 --> 00:42:06,390
And then two years, two hours
later, he was, you know,

664
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:10,890
the police called and said
he was dead. And, um, I, um,

665
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,730
and he did me a disservice because for,

666
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:19,740
and we'll get to this later in our
par core, uh, excursions. But, uh,

667
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:22,320
you know, for, for decades,

668
00:42:22,321 --> 00:42:27,321
I th I did do everything on my own and
it's only this last year that I realized

669
00:42:27,751 --> 00:42:30,570
the importance of the
other with a capital t,

670
00:42:30,571 --> 00:42:35,460
capital o that magic is,
is unleashed in the world.

671
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:40,380
Only when you're, uh,
a circuit is, is, is,

672
00:42:40,381 --> 00:42:43,710
is opened when you're,
when you're connecting with someone else.

673
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:47,730
And that's where the magic and
the miracles occur. And, uh,

674
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:52,950
I wish I had known that earlier. Why
don't you think you explored that earlier?

675
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:58,560
I wasn't aware of it. You mean the
other, yeah, the magic that occurs. Um,

676
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:04,350
cause I was always in my own world,
right? I mean, I was an introvert.

677
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:07,740
Um, in high school, I didn't
discover this till later.

678
00:43:07,741 --> 00:43:09,510
There were people that
had never seen me speak.

679
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:14,430
People that were around me every day for
four years had never seen me speak. And,

680
00:43:14,431 --> 00:43:18,840
um, and then, and yet I was so
animated with Fisher, right.

681
00:43:18,841 --> 00:43:20,640
And running up to him.
Um,

682
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:25,540
so I lived in my own world and, um, and I,

683
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:27,330
the world of ideas.

684
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:32,540
So I'm an aware of other people
and of course we all are. Um,

685
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:37,740
um, but I was an introvert to,
to an other worldly extreme. And,

686
00:43:37,741 --> 00:43:38,574
um,

687
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:43,230
and then only this year have
I realized and been excited,

688
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:45,280
really excited.
I'm um,

689
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:48,870
by engaging other people and you know,

690
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:54,030
and we should revisit those three rules
of success that we talked about it at

691
00:43:54,031 --> 00:43:57,870
the 92nd street y um,
cause they're all about other people.

692
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:02,810
We can talk about them now if you'd
like or we can come back to it. Um,

693
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:06,800
do you have a preference? Nope.
Nope. You're the, uh, I'm the,

694
00:44:06,801 --> 00:44:09,920
I'm the conductor here. Yes.
You're the ringmaster. All
right, we're going to come,

695
00:44:09,921 --> 00:44:11,450
we'll come back to that after the,

696
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:15,350
the tragedy with your father
involving your father,

697
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,210
you head to Oxford,

698
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:23,080
you're taking dance lessons extensible.
You're there for law. Yeah. Yeah.

699
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,700
Uh, this is, this is
the left turn yet again,

700
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,690
but how do we talked about this
a bit last night and night.

701
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:32,160
I just remember saying what,
so how

702
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:36,000
do, how do apples enter
the scene? Oh yeah.

703
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:41,790
You mean my, my nutritional odyssey. You
Nutritional Odyssey. And why, why did it,

704
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:46,680
why did it become what it was?
Yeah. So, so I arrive at Oxford and,

705
00:44:46,681 --> 00:44:50,910
and I had prepaid for room
and board and, um, you know,

706
00:44:50,911 --> 00:44:53,280
it's a cliche to say,
again, this is back then.

707
00:44:53,281 --> 00:44:57,870
Actually the food you can get
in England now is fantastic.

708
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:02,880
Um, but back then when I was a student,
it was a cliche to say English food was,

709
00:45:02,890 --> 00:45:07,170
was awful. Um, but then
English institutional food was,

710
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:11,250
it was inedible. And I,
and I couldn't afford,

711
00:45:11,251 --> 00:45:16,110
I could only afford to eat a one
meal a day and a out I, you know,

712
00:45:16,111 --> 00:45:21,111
pay in a restaurant and a
cause I'd already paid for
room and board and I refuse

713
00:45:21,181 --> 00:45:23,670
to eat the food. So I
used to go to this, uh,

714
00:45:23,671 --> 00:45:27,840
the only restaurant that I could afford
in Oxford was a vegetarian restaurant.

715
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:32,400
And I started eating vegetarian food.
And I,

716
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:37,260
and I realized as the days went on that,
that there were three food groups.

717
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:41,130
Um, there were foods that
made me feel really good. Um,

718
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,890
foods that were neutral and
foods that made me feel bad,

719
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:48,990
and the foods that made me feel good. The
Granny Smith, apples, carrots, raisins.

720
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:53,940
Oh, I remember what the fourth
word, cabbage, cabbage, cabbage.

721
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:59,070
And um, the, the neutral
foods were vegetables,

722
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:04,320
green vegetables, red vegetables, um,

723
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:08,640
but not white,
like rice or corn.

724
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:12,540
Anything, any grains were
negatives. Uh, meet was a,

725
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:17,580
became a negative. Uh, and dairy
products were negative. And, uh,

726
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:21,540
so my whole life I'd been training
for five hours a day, swimming,

727
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:22,433
plus weight lifting.

728
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:27,420
And then at Oxford I do nothing except
eat granny Smith apples basically.

729
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:32,550
Um, how did the negative effect you? Oh,

730
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:37,050
Oh, if I had, oh, I love, for example,

731
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:41,250
milk with my coffee, and if I had so
much as a teaspoon of milk in my coffee,

732
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:46,170
I'd get a sore throat. I'd
get instantly congested. Um,

733
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:48,420
I'd get tired.
Um,

734
00:46:48,990 --> 00:46:53,010
and so I just weeded all those things
out so that by the end of the year,

735
00:46:53,011 --> 00:46:55,020
I was basically a fruitarian.

736
00:46:55,710 --> 00:47:00,120
I think Steven jobs for a while was
a fruitarian. And, uh, and so as I,

737
00:47:00,121 --> 00:47:04,080
and I was a board to be
around cause people would say
let's go out for lunch and

738
00:47:04,081 --> 00:47:07,870
I'd, I'd, I'd have like
a salad or fruit cop.

739
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:11,310
The Mr had special please. Yeah.
It's exactly the Mister Ed special.

740
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:15,450
And so I come back and I had lost 20
pounds and it puts it in perspective for

741
00:47:15,451 --> 00:47:18,150
people. I mean you are
not Bobby Fischer. Right?

742
00:47:18,151 --> 00:47:21,100
So at the time before you lost
the 20 pounds, what was, what was,

743
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:25,620
what were your dimensions like? I
was a one 35 pretty solid muscle. Um,

744
00:47:25,650 --> 00:47:28,470
cause I've been an athlete my
whole life and I'm at five,

745
00:47:28,471 --> 00:47:33,430
eight said if I ever yeah, yeah. So then
you, you lost 20 pounds. Yeah. Yeah.

746
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:38,530
And, but I wasn't aware
that I was that skinny. Um,

747
00:47:39,070 --> 00:47:42,790
cause your, I guess your body get mid
shifts with it, but I just wasn't hungry.

748
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:48,030
Like a meal for the for the day might
be a pound of apples or two pounds of

749
00:47:48,221 --> 00:47:51,470
apples, maybe some carrots
really Mister Ed. Right.

750
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:56,060
And then I just wasn't hungry and some
days I would need it all. And, uh, anyway,

751
00:47:56,070 --> 00:47:59,380
so I come back, uh, uh, to, uh,

752
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:03,800
to New York where I was living at the
time. Uh, my mother was living and, um,

753
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:07,330
I go to my brother's health club cause
I decide I should get back in shape.

754
00:48:07,331 --> 00:48:10,720
I hadn't trained for a year.
Right. And imagine you Tim Ferriss,

755
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:14,340
not training for a year.
Right. And, um, so I, I,

756
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:19,270
I remember the first machine I sat on was
this Nautilus, a shoulder press. And I,

757
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:22,090
I set it for five plates,
like 50 pounds.

758
00:48:22,091 --> 00:48:26,110
And because I didn't want to Overdo it
and my arms shot up, they were weightless.

759
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:30,010
And then, and then I asked my brother,
who was standing next to me, I said, man,

760
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:35,040
you just blow it a couple of plates
and then make a 70 also shut up.

761
00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:36,820
And I said, okay, Matthew
loaded a couple more cars.

762
00:48:36,821 --> 00:48:41,320
I need a little weight that's too
light. So he does so and, and then I,

763
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:45,700
I, I pressed like 20 times and said,
yeah, that's about right. And, um,

764
00:48:45,970 --> 00:48:49,330
he comes around to the front of the,
of the machine and he said, okay,

765
00:48:49,331 --> 00:48:52,300
I'm not going to do anything. I just
wanted to come back around to the cause,

766
00:48:52,301 --> 00:48:55,180
the plates, the setting, we're
behind you right where I said it.

767
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:59,140
And he'd set it on the very lowest
setting. Um, like the full stack,

768
00:48:59,141 --> 00:49:03,670
like the football players. Right.
Um, and every machine was like that.

769
00:49:03,671 --> 00:49:08,230
I could max out on all
the machines easily,

770
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:13,180
um, with no effort. So odd.
It's so odd because I had,

771
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:17,740
you know, lost all this weight,
hadn't, hadn't trained for,

772
00:49:18,010 --> 00:49:22,780
for over a year. And even at that
when I was at it's peak condition,

773
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:28,320
I wasn't able to do that prior to
the dietary odyssey that I went on.

774
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:32,500
And, um, had to explain
that to yourself. Well, I,

775
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:36,070
I actually then started doing research,
like I discovered for example,

776
00:49:36,071 --> 00:49:40,060
that primitive man ate only
fruit. They've done, they,

777
00:49:40,450 --> 00:49:43,480
they did a molar studies. They have, um,

778
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:46,960
they found of skeletons and things and um,

779
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:51,780
primitive man that if you ate to
vegetables, there were fibers,

780
00:49:51,781 --> 00:49:55,540
scratches on the, on the
molars. And there were none.

781
00:49:55,541 --> 00:49:59,590
So they concluded that primitive man
had basically eaten mostly fruit.

782
00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:04,060
Um, and uh, so I don't
know. I think that was just,

783
00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:09,670
you know what, now that I think about
it, Tim, it's exactly what you do. Um,

784
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:14,790
you endlessly experiment to find the
optimal combination of whatever to Max out

785
00:50:18,010 --> 00:50:22,960
your performance on whatever dimension.
And that's what I did unwittingly. And,

786
00:50:22,961 --> 00:50:23,561
uh,
you know,

787
00:50:23,561 --> 00:50:28,250
I weeded out the foods that made me feel
bad and focused on the foods that made

788
00:50:28,251 --> 00:50:30,560
me feel good. And that's what I did. So

789
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:35,320
I was at, I was a Tim Ferriss
acolyte there before you were around.

790
00:50:35,590 --> 00:50:39,970
Have you, and I'm guessing you
probably not replicated the,

791
00:50:40,790 --> 00:50:44,190
the, the Granny Smith
experiment I'm very curious at,

792
00:50:44,191 --> 00:50:47,170
and I'm not recommending folks by the way,
that you go out and do the,

793
00:50:47,190 --> 00:50:48,280
the apple only diet.

794
00:50:48,281 --> 00:50:53,281
But we were joking last night about how
there are at least two foods that I've

795
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:56,740
experienced during
certain training periods.

796
00:50:56,741 --> 00:51:01,150
It seemed to have an odd performance
enhancing effect. That one.

797
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:04,600
So this is a long story, guys. I'm
not going to get into this too much,

798
00:51:04,601 --> 00:51:07,480
but for whatever reason,
tart apples. Yeah.

799
00:51:07,570 --> 00:51:11,920
And lentils for me also, uh, which,
which many people don't respond well to,

800
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:15,140
but, uh, very, very odd

801
00:51:15,290 --> 00:51:18,710
and well, you know, it's not
an an an, you know, and again,

802
00:51:18,711 --> 00:51:20,320
neither of us is advocating,
you know,

803
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:24,390
that you start consuming
granny Smith apples, um,

804
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:25,490
exclusively,

805
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:30,140
but certainly you should pay attention
to your body's responses to any food.

806
00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:35,120
And, and again, I, I had a
taxonomy of three food groups.

807
00:51:35,270 --> 00:51:36,500
Those that made me feel good,

808
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:41,510
those that were neutral and
those best avoided and, and, uh,

809
00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:44,720
and all of us should do that.
Um, not just with our foods,

810
00:51:44,721 --> 00:51:47,530
with everything in our
lives. Right. Um, um,

811
00:51:47,990 --> 00:51:50,390
optimize our functioning and
that's what you're all about

812
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:53,230
it, it isn't a lot of ways.
Now these days though,

813
00:51:53,231 --> 00:51:56,260
you do consume your coffee with milk.
Sure.

814
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:59,980
So then I think this is how the io came,
powder came up. So have you, have you,

815
00:52:00,010 --> 00:52:02,950
did you gradually reintroduce these foods,

816
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:06,680
including negatives that you
wanted to include or, sure.

817
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:10,270
I mean the,
I was a board a be with,

818
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:15,300
because people would invite me out
to a Japanese restaurant and I'd say,

819
00:52:15,581 --> 00:52:20,380
oh, I really can't eat anything on the
menu. Do you have apples to apples?

820
00:52:20,410 --> 00:52:24,960
Uh, um, and, uh, so, so it,

821
00:52:24,990 --> 00:52:28,090
it took me a couple of years actually
to get back to normal eating.

822
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:32,150
And so right now I eat healthily.
Um,

823
00:52:32,470 --> 00:52:37,180
but I eat some negatives. So, you know,
I, I try to limit dairy products, but, uh,

824
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:42,240
but I love, I love milk in my coffee,
so what the hell, you know? Um,

825
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:46,990
I know it's not optimal for
my body, but, but I enjoy it.

826
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:50,540
Was it, it was maybe Elizabeth
Taylor, I want to say. He said,

827
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:52,150
yeah,

828
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:55,690
something along the lines of the problem
with people who don't have vices is

829
00:52:55,691 --> 00:52:58,060
that you can be pretty sure
they very annoying virtues.

830
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:03,800
Y'All need a few vices here and there.
Let's,

831
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:06,320
let's go back to the
three rules for success.

832
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:08,103
Uh,

833
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,240
can you, I'll let you take it
from here. The mic is yours.

834
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:14,580
Well, you know, and uh,

835
00:53:16,770 --> 00:53:20,520
just by way of, of, uh, of, of background,

836
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:25,290
it began when you asked me how you, you
mark the end of a year. And I said, I,

837
00:53:25,350 --> 00:53:29,730
I reflect on the lessons I learned the
the past year and I make a conscious

838
00:53:29,731 --> 00:53:32,610
effort to apply them in the coming
new year. Cause you asked me this,

839
00:53:32,630 --> 00:53:35,970
what a month ago, right? And it's
right, right back in December. And, uh,

840
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:40,830
and so I thought you asked me what
did I learn in, in 2016? And I said,

841
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,490
I learned three things and,
and I,

842
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:49,800
I learned the importance of fun,

843
00:53:49,801 --> 00:53:54,180
enthusiasm, and delight in everything
you do. Absolutely everything.

844
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:59,490
Um, and first and foremost, um, fun,

845
00:53:59,491 --> 00:54:01,530
enthusiasm and delight.
And we'll come back to that.

846
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:06,860
The second is connecting with everyone
you encounter on however fleeting a

847
00:54:08,851 --> 00:54:13,410
basis. And you've been with me and
you see, I do that Uber drivers,

848
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:17,450
uh, maitre ds, everybody,
you name it, I, right. I'm,

849
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:21,370
I put that into action. You really
connect with the person, um,

850
00:54:22,990 --> 00:54:25,580
in however fleeting that connection is,
but you,

851
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:29,340
you make an effort to make
a connection. Um, and, uh,

852
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:35,780
and the third is to lean into each moment
and each encounter and everyone you

853
00:54:37,861 --> 00:54:41,550
meet expecting magic or miracles.
And,

854
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:44,070
and those were the three things I learned.

855
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:48,930
And the interesting thing about all of
them is that none of them have anything

856
00:54:48,931 --> 00:54:53,550
to do with me. It's all about
the other person, right?

857
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:57,580
And when I say fun, delight and
enthusiasm, it's to create fun,

858
00:54:57,581 --> 00:55:01,260
to lighten and enthusiasm for
the other person. Um, and that,

859
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:05,140
that goes for if you're
going to a meeting, um,

860
00:55:05,490 --> 00:55:09,540
and you want us with a venture capitalist
because you're looking for funding for

861
00:55:09,541 --> 00:55:13,890
your startup, or you're going on a
date, uh, or you're, you're, you're,

862
00:55:13,891 --> 00:55:17,880
you're going on a job interview.
Forget the fact that it's an interview.

863
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,040
You're going to delight the other person.

864
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:24,270
That's what you're there for first
and foremost, and to make connection.

865
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:25,740
And if you do,

866
00:55:25,830 --> 00:55:29,460
if that's your focus as opposed to
getting the job or getting the funding,

867
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:35,850
then you get magic and miracles. But
that should be your primary focus. And,

868
00:55:35,851 --> 00:55:39,270
uh,
and what it does is it,

869
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:44,640
it gives you infinite power
because you want nothing.

870
00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:49,960
And you're offering everything
all I want. I mean, that's what I,

871
00:55:49,961 --> 00:55:54,610
in this moment now with you sitting as
sitting in front of you on your couch, um,

872
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:58,500
is to,
is to connect with you and to delight you.

873
00:55:59,400 --> 00:55:59,941
So it's,

874
00:55:59,941 --> 00:56:04,200
I'm playing a game I can't lose and
I'm in total control and I don't want

875
00:56:04,201 --> 00:56:07,330
anything. And, uh, so, uh,

876
00:56:08,310 --> 00:56:13,200
that's such a revelation for me and
I wish I had known that earlier.

877
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:18,660
How did, how did that, I'd be curious
to hear how that revolution came about.

878
00:56:18,661 --> 00:56:21,810
So you mentioned depression earlier,
which I definitely want to talk about.

879
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:23,800
And I've certainly

880
00:56:24,430 --> 00:56:28,060
talked and written about my
own battles with extended, uh,

881
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:32,620
depression and some very
severe episodes over the years.

882
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:37,660
And uh, you mentioned Tony
Robbins earlier. So Tony Robbins,

883
00:56:37,661 --> 00:56:41,050
I remember underscored something
for me maybe a year and a half ago,

884
00:56:41,110 --> 00:56:45,820
which was effectively suffering
is an excessive focus on yourself.

885
00:56:46,250 --> 00:56:47,610
There you go. Yourself. Right.

886
00:56:48,290 --> 00:56:53,290
That was a lesson that I underlined and
highlighted and revisited many times

887
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:58,840
since he imparted that to me because it
seemed like the best medicine for fixing

888
00:56:59,181 --> 00:57:02,690
myself was to stop focusing on
myself in the, in many respects.

889
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:04,930
Absolutely. I, and I,

890
00:57:04,950 --> 00:57:09,490
I've taught Tony Robbins
one of the greats, right.

891
00:57:09,550 --> 00:57:13,450
Um, however, with respect to depression,

892
00:57:13,870 --> 00:57:18,550
one of the insidious things, um,
Nah, insidious isn't the right word.

893
00:57:18,790 --> 00:57:23,230
One of the sinister things about
depression is that it, it's a,

894
00:57:24,730 --> 00:57:25,563
okay,

895
00:57:25,930 --> 00:57:28,900
it works by getting a vice
grip on your thinking,

896
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:33,850
so you're incapable of
thinking outside of yourself.

897
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:37,920
Um,
that and really the,

898
00:57:37,921 --> 00:57:39,730
the worst aspect of depression

899
00:57:41,970 --> 00:57:44,880
between the ages of,
Oh golly,

900
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:49,260
14 and say 30. There wasn't a day. I,

901
00:57:50,010 --> 00:57:54,360
I didn't wrestle with the hamlet
question to be or not to be. Um,

902
00:57:55,590 --> 00:58:00,540
and, uh, the worst thing about, and some
days for example, um, I remember a period,

903
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:02,280
yeah,

904
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:06,150
for a couple of months I didn't leave my
apartment. I had the, the blinds drawn.

905
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:11,340
Um, I would order in from,
from a deli. Um, and the,

906
00:58:11,341 --> 00:58:14,520
the, the worst aspect of,
of depression is that you,

907
00:58:14,850 --> 00:58:19,230
you come to despise yourself and you,
you,

908
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:22,920
you believe that only now in depression.

909
00:58:23,310 --> 00:58:28,020
Are you thinking clearly? Yes. And
that before you were delusional,

910
00:58:28,050 --> 00:58:30,890
yes. This is [inaudible] and
you hate yourself for you.

911
00:58:31,110 --> 00:58:35,910
You hate yourself for being diluted,
and that nobody understands.

912
00:58:35,911 --> 00:58:36,420
Now.

913
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:41,420
Now I am thinking clearly
now nothing matters.

914
00:58:42,210 --> 00:58:45,030
And, and, uh, and that's,

915
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:49,680
that's really the devil at work.
That's why I say sinister. Um,

916
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:55,400
because depression traps your thinking
and it hijacks your thinking like a virus

917
00:58:58,470 --> 00:59:01,710
and, um, and you despise yourself.

918
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:05,910
You despise yourself for
being diluted previously.

919
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:09,000
And a lot of people in their
lives despising themselves.

920
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:13,250
What took you out of that pattern?

921
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:16,820
You mentioned, uh, I'm
blanking on the exact ages,

922
00:59:16,821 --> 00:59:21,050
but you said something like
14 to 30 years. Sure. And
then, and then episodically.

923
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:26,270
Okay. After that point, um, I
mean, between 14 and 30, it was,

924
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:29,900
it was unrelenting. Um, it was a siege

925
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:36,020
of me against my, my depression. Um,

926
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:39,950
and then it was episodic. And
then I'm not sure. It just,

927
00:59:41,450 --> 00:59:44,160
I don't know if it was biochemical.
Um,

928
00:59:44,510 --> 00:59:48,010
but it just lifted.
And how,

929
00:59:48,350 --> 00:59:50,780
if you don't mind me asking him when,
when it lifted,

930
00:59:50,781 --> 00:59:54,800
how old were you when I say
lifted it again? It would get,

931
00:59:54,801 --> 00:59:58,790
could come back. Sure. Um,
but I haven't, for example,

932
00:59:58,791 --> 01:00:03,470
now I haven't had an episode
of depression and probably

933
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:09,460
a decade. That's a long
story, long stretch. And I,

934
01:00:09,550 --> 01:00:14,300
I think it's a biochemical shift
cause depression also, as you know,

935
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:16,850
and the word depression

936
01:00:18,350 --> 01:00:21,200
reflects not just the mental state,
but the physical state.

937
01:00:21,201 --> 01:00:26,000
Your energy level is low. And I think,
you know, and to go back to Tony Robbins,

938
01:00:26,001 --> 01:00:26,181
you know,

939
01:00:26,181 --> 01:00:29,570
one of the great things about Tony
Robins is he's high energy and you think

940
01:00:29,571 --> 01:00:33,320
about all like Richard
Branson and Elon Musk and you,

941
01:00:33,321 --> 01:00:38,180
Tim high energy and, and, and one way to,

942
01:00:38,181 --> 01:00:39,270
to, to, uh,

943
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:43,820
escape from slipping
into depression is to,

944
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:48,880
is to be ever vigilant about keeping
your energy level high and to notice the

945
01:00:50,330 --> 01:00:54,530
biochemical markers
that precede depression.

946
01:00:54,830 --> 01:00:59,570
So you can, uh, headed off at the
pass before you, you slip into it.

947
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:02,830
Because once you slip
into it, I mean, yeah,

948
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:06,110
you're no very difficult.
You're essentially,

949
01:01:06,111 --> 01:01:09,740
you're going to go down that slope for
a while and then it's going to take,

950
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:13,820
you know, days, a weeks or months to
come out of it. What are some of the,

951
01:01:13,970 --> 01:01:17,720
I guess not red flags,
but orange flags for yourself?

952
01:01:17,721 --> 01:01:22,130
The biochemical markers that would
tell you check engine light. Okay.

953
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:24,290
Something,
something's going in the wrong direction.

954
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:28,910
Certain seasonal things like in the
winter and people suffer from seasonal

955
01:01:28,911 --> 01:01:29,930
affective disorder.

956
01:01:30,710 --> 01:01:34,310
I think it's really just noticing
your energy levels day to day.

957
01:01:34,311 --> 01:01:36,920
For me personally,
that was the marker for me.

958
01:01:37,190 --> 01:01:40,430
And each individual will
have markers that will be,

959
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:43,250
if you suffer from depression.
And by the way,

960
01:01:43,430 --> 01:01:45,560
neither of us has giving medical advice.

961
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:49,280
Of course we're not the thing
we're invested in advice
or advice of any kind, um,

962
01:01:49,281 --> 01:01:53,030
informational purposes, only
informational purposes only. But, uh, but,

963
01:01:53,090 --> 01:01:57,410
but all of us should become aware of,
and again this is a,

964
01:01:57,411 --> 01:02:02,360
a Ferris principle,
a Ferris first principle or axiom is,

965
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:03,553
is to,

966
01:02:03,830 --> 01:02:08,480
is to be aware of what works and what
doesn't work and and keep experimenting

967
01:02:08,481 --> 01:02:09,530
and,
and,

968
01:02:09,950 --> 01:02:14,470
and doing more of what works and less
of what doesn't work and uh, and,

969
01:02:15,050 --> 01:02:17,780
and eventually you,
you,

970
01:02:18,650 --> 01:02:22,650
you optimize and become a very
high functioning individual.

971
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:25,920
So I'm going to come back to depression.
I'm going to shift gears a little bit.

972
01:02:25,921 --> 01:02:28,650
I'm going to come back to because it,
my interactions with you,

973
01:02:28,651 --> 01:02:32,070
I know that your brain works very well in
this conversational format. Sure, sure.

974
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:35,320
So I'm going to allow the
question on depression,

975
01:02:35,321 --> 01:02:40,321
which is going to be 10 years ago
when you seem to click out of that,

976
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:44,350
sure. Condition, what things
correlated, where there other things,

977
01:02:44,370 --> 01:02:48,670
new people in your life, new behaviors,
dietary changes, whatever it might be.

978
01:02:48,671 --> 01:02:49,870
We don't have to hit it right now,

979
01:02:49,930 --> 01:02:52,810
but I'm going to let that we've added
as a parenthesis, we'll come back to it.

980
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:55,330
We'll come back to it because I know
that that will be working on the back

981
01:02:55,331 --> 01:02:59,770
burner in your head, things
that work. And to provide some,

982
01:02:59,771 --> 01:03:00,820
some context for folks.

983
01:03:00,821 --> 01:03:05,821
So you were very kind to come out
and visit me in San Francisco and a,

984
01:03:06,490 --> 01:03:11,490
you brought a lot of ideas with you and
I remember this was after at the 92 why

985
01:03:11,860 --> 01:03:16,720
Josh agreed that you were one of the best
gift givers in the world and the gift

986
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:20,830
said would take you some time to prepare
and then they were ideas for me and you

987
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:23,490
came out to share them. And we've been
spending a lot of time together. Yeah.

988
01:03:23,590 --> 01:03:28,590
You have also been writing a book and uh,

989
01:03:29,290 --> 01:03:32,710
you've been taking a lot of bats.
And I remember asking,

990
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:38,160
do you always take baths when you are
working on some type of creative product,

991
01:03:38,770 --> 01:03:42,580
uh, project? And he said, well, are you
familiar with the three bs of creativity?

992
01:03:42,850 --> 01:03:46,150
I said, no, I'm not. So speaking
of things that, that work,

993
01:03:46,180 --> 01:03:49,510
can you describe the three bs of
creativity or this is the three bs of

994
01:03:49,511 --> 01:03:50,344
creativity.

995
01:03:50,370 --> 01:03:51,930
Uh,
you know,

996
01:03:51,931 --> 01:03:56,790
creativity is getting in touch
with your unconscious and, and,

997
01:03:56,791 --> 01:03:58,170
uh, you know, you, you,

998
01:03:58,230 --> 01:04:03,230
you consciously pose a question to your
mind and you allow your unconscious too

999
01:04:06,470 --> 01:04:10,250
to percolate on it. And,
and Josh are bestie.

1000
01:04:10,910 --> 01:04:14,250
It's written extensively
about this. And, and, and,

1001
01:04:14,251 --> 01:04:17,180
and few people in the world
do it better than he does. Um,

1002
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:19,220
but the three B's are bed,

1003
01:04:20,180 --> 01:04:24,290
bath and a boss and a,

1004
01:04:24,620 --> 01:04:28,670
and buses a is a, is a metaphor
for traveling. So when you want to,

1005
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:31,280
when you have a problem
that you're, you've, your,

1006
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:35,420
your conscious mind has
thoroughly exhausted,

1007
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:40,700
then you give it over to your
unconscious and, uh, so you go to sleep,

1008
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,750
right? That's bad. Um,

1009
01:04:42,830 --> 01:04:45,920
for me,
which could be a long overnight sleep or

1010
01:04:45,990 --> 01:04:48,820
it could be an APP, right?
It could be a nap. Um,

1011
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:52,810
you want to get to the
dream state, um, a bath,

1012
01:04:53,410 --> 01:04:56,150
which you could do at any point also.
Um,

1013
01:04:56,290 --> 01:04:59,410
or you switch location bosses.
Again,

1014
01:04:59,411 --> 01:05:04,210
a metaphor just for
alliterative per purposes. Um,

1015
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:09,570
[inaudible] you switch your,
your location and, um, and,

1016
01:05:09,610 --> 01:05:14,500
and that allows your, your unconscious
mind to, uh, to address the problem.

1017
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:18,860
And that again, that's where the magic
occurs. Your unconscious, we in, in,

1018
01:05:19,060 --> 01:05:22,990
in Western civilization over the
last few thousand years, we've,

1019
01:05:23,050 --> 01:05:26,650
we've deified logic and rationality.
Um,

1020
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:31,710
and the irrational intuitive
mind has gotten, uh, you know,

1021
01:05:31,810 --> 01:05:35,410
short the short end of the
stick and we dismiss it.

1022
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:39,310
But that's actually our intuitive
mind and our unconscious mind.

1023
01:05:40,030 --> 01:05:43,840
I would say our primitive mind in that
sense is far more advanced and far more

1024
01:05:43,841 --> 01:05:44,674
powerful than,

1025
01:05:45,670 --> 01:05:50,200
than the advances we've made in logic
and deductive thinking, which is,

1026
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:54,940
um, you know, our unconscious
mind is like a supercomputer, uh,

1027
01:05:55,540 --> 01:05:58,780
compared to the trivial apparatus of,
uh,

1028
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:00,550
of our logical mind.

1029
01:06:01,070 --> 01:06:01,640
I've been,

1030
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:05,400
this is something I've been thinking
about a lot in the last three years. Uh,

1031
01:06:05,580 --> 01:06:10,400
and some of it relates
to psychedelic research,

1032
01:06:10,430 --> 01:06:13,880
we'll call it. Ah, but ah,

1033
01:06:13,881 --> 01:06:18,800
that's there two episodes on that for
people interested. Uh, so Martine Planko,

1034
01:06:18,801 --> 01:06:20,810
Martin Polanco and uh,

1035
01:06:21,170 --> 01:06:23,870
Dan Angle and James Fadiman
if you want to look those up,

1036
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:25,520
we're not going to dig
too deep there right now,

1037
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:30,820
but I've tried in the last three years
to really pay more attention to and

1038
01:06:31,461 --> 01:06:36,461
sensitize myself to
these tiny perturbations.

1039
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:41,120
Is that a real word? And uh, my,

1040
01:06:41,150 --> 01:06:46,150
my visceral response to things and to
really hone what I had trained myself to

1041
01:06:48,981 --> 01:06:50,330
ignore for so long.

1042
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:54,260
And you were talking last night and also
today about being detached from your

1043
01:06:54,261 --> 01:06:57,500
physical body after the,
the hospital experience and so on,

1044
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:02,360
and only sort of reintegrating those
sensory inputs and really relishing them

1045
01:07:02,361 --> 01:07:04,760
and paying attention to them recently.
And for me,

1046
01:07:04,761 --> 01:07:07,760
I've been doing the same thing in the
last three years instead of powering ahead

1047
01:07:07,761 --> 01:07:11,840
and ignoring all these physical cues
and what you might call intuition,

1048
01:07:11,841 --> 01:07:14,900
which has gotten a bum rap for
very understandable reasons.

1049
01:07:14,901 --> 01:07:17,990
I think it's abused and
misapplied and a lot of places,

1050
01:07:17,991 --> 01:07:22,820
but I've been paying attention,
trying to pay more attention to this,

1051
01:07:22,821 --> 01:07:26,390
what we might call primitive
but certainly evolved. Yes.

1052
01:07:26,450 --> 01:07:29,540
Instinctual reflexive response to things.
Absolutely.

1053
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:31,560
And you know, the, the thing is that

1054
01:07:33,210 --> 01:07:36,720
actually I'll share a
fascinating experience. Um,

1055
01:07:37,710 --> 01:07:42,570
I was at a chess tournament 20 years
ago and I'm, I'm a rated master,

1056
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:46,890
very, very strong. And I was playing
another rated master to big tournament.

1057
01:07:46,891 --> 01:07:50,730
The world opened in Philadelphia,
this is like 20 years ago. And, um,

1058
01:07:51,390 --> 01:07:56,390
and I had had a strong opening
advantage against this opponent.

1059
01:07:57,900 --> 01:08:00,180
And if you're unfamiliar
with the game of chess,

1060
01:08:00,420 --> 01:08:03,060
it would be imagine a
wrestling match where,

1061
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:05,700
where you haven't pinned the upon it yet,
but you've,

1062
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:10,410
he's having a hard time moving and,
and, and if it goes on much longer,

1063
01:08:10,411 --> 01:08:11,520
you are going to pin him.

1064
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:16,610
So my opponent was squirming and cause
I had opening advantage and then I

1065
01:08:16,611 --> 01:08:21,110
blundered I lost a piece. Actually
I lost what's known as the exchange,

1066
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:25,100
a rook for a night. Um, and uh, which is,

1067
01:08:25,190 --> 01:08:30,020
I lost one of my stronger pieces
for one of his weaker pieces.

1068
01:08:30,380 --> 01:08:35,380
So he had an edge and he was really happy
and I knew I'm going to lose the game.

1069
01:08:35,511 --> 01:08:38,450
I mean I was really pissed with myself
cause I blundered I wasn't paying

1070
01:08:38,451 --> 01:08:42,710
attention. And as I'm staring
at the board, and again,

1071
01:08:42,711 --> 01:08:46,160
I'm just really pissed with myself,
I hear a voice,

1072
01:08:46,490 --> 01:08:50,930
somebody whispers from behind and says,
uh, you can wait in this position.

1073
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:55,580
Just like that. And I spun around
cause it Chester tournaments,

1074
01:08:55,581 --> 01:08:59,480
you're not allowed to give advice, give
advice. And there was no one there.

1075
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:04,820
And I, I thought, oh, well
that's odd. I was like, sure.

1076
01:09:04,821 --> 01:09:08,900
Someone had just whispered in my ear and,
you know,

1077
01:09:08,901 --> 01:09:09,860
just to jump ahead,

1078
01:09:09,861 --> 01:09:14,510
it was my unconscious mind that was
tapping me on the shoulder. And, uh,

1079
01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:19,280
but it manifested itself as a
voice and a really distinct,

1080
01:09:19,370 --> 01:09:21,380
so I, I, um,

1081
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:24,950
if you can imagine I'm looking at the
chess board and I don't want the opponent

1082
01:09:24,951 --> 01:09:27,950
to see that, uh, that I
have any hope or anything.

1083
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:32,360
So I'm doing my best woody Allen
Imitation, you know, like, ah,

1084
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:34,610
I'm going to lose this.
And, but meanwhile,

1085
01:09:34,611 --> 01:09:38,720
I'm studying the board really closely
and I see an incredible combination,

1086
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:42,290
like the kind of combination
that Magnus Carlson would,

1087
01:09:42,291 --> 01:09:45,800
it would have been pleased with
himself if he had seen. And, um,

1088
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:48,350
and I won the game. And, uh,

1089
01:09:48,650 --> 01:09:52,560
I lost every game after that
in the, in the, in the, um,

1090
01:09:53,420 --> 01:09:56,000
in the tournament because I wasn't
interested in the games anymore.

1091
01:09:56,001 --> 01:10:00,200
I wanted to hear the voice
that spoke to me. And, uh,

1092
01:10:00,410 --> 01:10:04,910
and the thing is that your
unconscious mind, um, the muses,

1093
01:10:05,060 --> 01:10:07,310
the gods, the universe, um,

1094
01:10:07,820 --> 01:10:11,120
are all whispering to you
all the time. And, and,

1095
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:14,390
and you need to close
out your conscious mind.

1096
01:10:14,660 --> 01:10:19,280
Find ways to shut it down to hear those
voices because they're whispering all

1097
01:10:19,281 --> 01:10:23,560
the time and, um, and,
and you need to hear,

1098
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:29,210
hear them and heat them.
Um, so, uh, like you, I,

1099
01:10:29,270 --> 01:10:33,920
uh,
had been actively looking for ways to,

1100
01:10:33,921 --> 01:10:37,860
to hear those voices because
they're there all the time. And, uh,

1101
01:10:38,390 --> 01:10:40,340
I think for myself,
at least,

1102
01:10:40,970 --> 01:10:45,970
I prided myself on not being
distracted by some of those things,

1103
01:10:46,070 --> 01:10:46,131
uh,

1104
01:10:46,131 --> 01:10:51,131
meaning emotional insights that
we're not tapping me on the shoulder,

1105
01:10:51,891 --> 01:10:54,950
probably punching me in the shoulder or
many years. And I remember at one point,

1106
01:10:54,951 --> 01:10:57,140
this is probably two
thousand four thousand five,

1107
01:10:57,710 --> 01:11:02,710
I was agonizing over this contract.

1108
01:11:03,470 --> 01:11:06,710
It was a, uh, it was going to
be a longterm business deal.

1109
01:11:07,370 --> 01:11:10,490
And I had a number of issues,

1110
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:14,370
a number of issues with it as
well as the parties involved.

1111
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:18,330
And I created these huge pro and con
lists. And I remember at one point,

1112
01:11:18,930 --> 01:11:22,410
agonizing over this for weeks and it was
just consuming my thoughts 24, seven.

1113
01:11:23,130 --> 01:11:28,080
And my girlfriend at the time asked me,
she goes, do you even trust this guy?

1114
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:32,820
And I looked at her and I
go, not really. And she goes,

1115
01:11:32,821 --> 01:11:35,790
then don't do the deal. And I
was like, good advice. Right?

1116
01:11:37,170 --> 01:11:39,000
And of course if I had,

1117
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:43,260
I immediately knew the answer and I was
trying to override it with some type of

1118
01:11:43,261 --> 01:11:44,430
hyper rational,

1119
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:50,920
logical apparatus and it would have
been self defeating in retrospect.

1120
01:11:51,321 --> 01:11:54,170
I absolutely should not have done
the deal. And I'm glad that I didn't.

1121
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:58,890
Right. So, so, so three
things jump to mind. Um,

1122
01:11:59,070 --> 01:12:02,610
so first you had a choice there,
right?

1123
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:07,290
You didn't have to do the deal,
but because you want it to do the deal,

1124
01:12:07,470 --> 01:12:12,450
you were looking for ways to rationalize
what your unconscious mind was telling

1125
01:12:12,451 --> 01:12:17,250
you. Right? Your unconscious mind was
saying don't do the deal. Um, and uh,

1126
01:12:17,370 --> 01:12:21,420
in the same way that a,
so you don't have to take every deal.

1127
01:12:21,421 --> 01:12:24,330
And that's one of theW to
jump back to Warren Buffet.

1128
01:12:24,390 --> 01:12:28,680
That's one of his advantages is any,
he's written extensively about this,

1129
01:12:28,860 --> 01:12:29,693
that uh,

1130
01:12:29,730 --> 01:12:34,730
it's like the market is a pitcher and
an everyday it's going to pitch lots of

1131
01:12:36,661 --> 01:12:41,320
balls to you and you don't have to swing.
But you know,

1132
01:12:41,330 --> 01:12:42,840
once we got any of them that day,

1133
01:12:42,930 --> 01:12:47,460
you just wait for a fat pitch
and then you swing for it. Um,

1134
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:52,200
so, so one of the, one of the dangers
when you really want something,

1135
01:12:52,350 --> 01:12:54,990
whether it's a relationship
or a business deal,

1136
01:12:55,230 --> 01:13:00,230
your conscious mind will rationalize and
will shut down your unconscious mind,

1137
01:13:00,781 --> 01:13:03,240
which is screaming at this point.
Don't do it.

1138
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:07,710
Walk away whenever things seem a
little strange or a little off,

1139
01:13:08,730 --> 01:13:12,150
that's your unconscious mind
telling you they're really strange.

1140
01:13:12,151 --> 01:13:17,070
And really off and walk away cause
you always have a choice. Again,

1141
01:13:17,071 --> 01:13:20,220
whether it's a relationship or
a business deal, just walk away.

1142
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,160
Okay.
Uh,

1143
01:13:22,250 --> 01:13:27,250
in a minute I'm going to come back to
the clicking out of repeated episodes of

1144
01:13:28,971 --> 01:13:32,480
depression. Then ask what might have
correlated or correspondence. Sure.

1145
01:13:32,660 --> 01:13:34,310
Even if it's not causal,
I'm just curious,

1146
01:13:34,820 --> 01:13:39,080
but I'm going to give you a taste of
things to come. This is a new exercise.

1147
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:43,700
I'm going to be, Hey, wait, wait,
where's, where's? Oh, there she is.

1148
01:13:43,730 --> 01:13:45,860
I was looking for Molly.
She's asleep. Oh yeah. No.

1149
01:13:45,861 --> 01:13:48,170
Mollys mollys resting and typical pose,

1150
01:13:48,171 --> 01:13:53,171
which is half of her body on dog bed
head on the extremely hard floor.

1151
01:13:53,740 --> 01:13:57,550
You know, for those who you
don't know that Molly is,

1152
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:02,920
if I have ever met a sweeter,
better behaved,

1153
01:14:03,220 --> 01:14:08,200
more beautiful dog in my life,
I don't recall. And, and uh,

1154
01:14:08,380 --> 01:14:12,970
so I was hoping she would come on over
and sit in my lap while, by the way,

1155
01:14:12,971 --> 01:14:17,540
she's 60 pounds. Isn't that like an easy
sit in the lap? But, but, um, she's,

1156
01:14:17,650 --> 01:14:21,160
maybe she'll grace us a little later
with her, with her, with her presence,

1157
01:14:21,161 --> 01:14:22,720
with her,
with her joy.

1158
01:14:22,830 --> 01:14:27,510
She's, she's, she is being
a good intro interview dog.

1159
01:14:27,660 --> 01:14:32,310
She's, she's figured out that this
is, this is usually a sideline gig.

1160
01:14:32,490 --> 01:14:36,810
Okay. But, uh, I'm going to
pull out a random question.

1161
01:14:37,090 --> 01:14:40,290
Allah,
the Tao Te Ching,

1162
01:14:40,291 --> 01:14:44,610
which is one of Joshua's favorite books.
So in the spirit of Josh,

1163
01:14:44,790 --> 01:14:47,790
who was a, in a, in
absentia here at the moment,

1164
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:52,400
just going to pick a random question.
If I don't like any of these more Parker,

1165
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:55,500
let's jump. Let's do it. What
are you, okay, here we go.

1166
01:14:56,010 --> 01:14:59,490
This is just pulled out of a,
a selection of questions.

1167
01:14:59,491 --> 01:15:01,200
What are you most daring about?

1168
01:15:01,990 --> 01:15:05,560
Wow. Oh boy. That, that,
that, that, that, uh,

1169
01:15:06,270 --> 01:15:09,070
I got to think about that. What
am I most during about? Well,

1170
01:15:09,071 --> 01:15:13,660
I'll tell you something. Um, 2017 is a
year about being daring about everything.

1171
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:16,540
I don't know that there's a most daring,

1172
01:15:16,570 --> 01:15:19,870
I'm daring about everything
I'm doing about the future.

1173
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:22,720
Do you view yourself as a risk taker?

1174
01:15:24,290 --> 01:15:28,280
You know, it's funny. Let's reframe
risk. I would love that. Yeah.

1175
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:32,030
Which is why I throw it out
there. Sure. Of course. Um, uh,

1176
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:36,800
so there are two ways to, to,
to, to live life and one is,

1177
01:15:37,370 --> 01:15:41,750
is in the pursuit of
gain or to avoid loss.

1178
01:15:42,410 --> 01:15:45,830
And those are the two options.
I think if there's another,

1179
01:15:45,831 --> 01:15:50,120
I think it's pretty binary.
Yup. Um, and, uh, you know,

1180
01:15:50,121 --> 01:15:51,670
nature has,

1181
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:56,580
has evolved us as a species
to be risk averse, um,

1182
01:15:56,930 --> 01:16:01,910
to avoid taking chances and,
and not to lose

1183
01:16:02,330 --> 01:16:05,070
and to overreact to perceive threats,
right.

1184
01:16:05,180 --> 01:16:09,430
Because the penalty for overreaction
to perceived threats is less than

1185
01:16:09,910 --> 01:16:10,740
underreacting

1186
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:12,780
right. Mc. And to go back to Fisher,

1187
01:16:12,781 --> 01:16:16,200
the great thing about Fisher
was he wasn't afraid to lose.

1188
01:16:16,740 --> 01:16:19,860
He wanted to win. And if it meant
he was going to lose a game,

1189
01:16:20,100 --> 01:16:24,160
so be it because he wanted to win and,

1190
01:16:24,460 --> 01:16:28,770
and he was willing to lose
in order to win. And, um,

1191
01:16:29,250 --> 01:16:33,930
you know, I, I play a game now
with myself, with the world,

1192
01:16:34,570 --> 01:16:37,710
um, that I can't lose. So there's no risk.

1193
01:16:38,250 --> 01:16:42,540
It goes back to those three things,
connecting with people, which I can do.

1194
01:16:43,170 --> 01:16:45,420
And I think I do pretty well.
Um,

1195
01:16:46,230 --> 01:16:51,060
creating fun and delight and
approaching each person with enthusiasm,

1196
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:54,990
um, which again, I'm in
total control of. Um,

1197
01:16:55,770 --> 01:16:59,880
and leaning into each moment expecting
magic. I'm in control of all three.

1198
01:17:00,330 --> 01:17:04,560
So what's the risk? I mean I
have nothing to lose and, and um,

1199
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:08,410
I'm in, it's a game that, uh,

1200
01:17:10,310 --> 01:17:14,660
yeah, it's game you can't lose. So
what's the risk? The simultaneously,

1201
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:17,120
you made an astute observation earlier,

1202
01:17:17,540 --> 01:17:20,270
which we don't necessarily have to get
into the weeds on, but I do think it's a,

1203
01:17:20,271 --> 01:17:22,100
it's a good observation.
And it came up,

1204
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:27,280
we were having Thai food and I mentioned
a book that I enjoyed a great deal.

1205
01:17:30,610 --> 01:17:34,370
Uh, but when I read it about, I'm guessing
now maybe seven or eight years ago,

1206
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:38,560
called more money than God by,
I think his name is Sebastian Mallaby.

1207
01:17:38,580 --> 01:17:39,450
I'm not sure to get it.
Yeah.

1208
01:17:39,700 --> 01:17:44,700
But which I thought it was a very
intelligent overview of the origins of the

1209
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:50,630
hedge fund and some of the,
the characters and styles in the,

1210
01:17:50,631 --> 01:17:52,290
in the hedge fund world.
Yeah, I know. Wow.

1211
01:17:53,870 --> 01:17:58,870
But you observed that many hedge
funds do not in fact hedge hedge.

1212
01:17:59,330 --> 01:18:00,163
Yeah.

1213
01:18:01,170 --> 01:18:01,460
Okay.

1214
01:18:01,460 --> 01:18:06,090
Right. Um, so, so yes.

1215
01:18:06,091 --> 01:18:06,980
So hedge funds,

1216
01:18:06,981 --> 01:18:11,840
the concept of a hedge fund
was originated in 1948,

1217
01:18:11,841 --> 01:18:14,510
however many years ago. That is, uh, um,

1218
01:18:14,630 --> 01:18:18,190
I'm not gonna interrupt the
flow of the magic of the moment.

1219
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:21,380
Try to calculate that. That's
okay. We'll go with 40 or 52. Wait,

1220
01:18:21,381 --> 01:18:25,640
I'm going to do it right now. If need
to at 16. It's 68 years ago. Oh, no. 69,

1221
01:18:25,641 --> 01:18:30,641
because this is 2017 and I'm so the notion
of hedge funds was invented 69 years

1222
01:18:30,801 --> 01:18:35,080
ago and um, okay. But yeah, most,

1223
01:18:35,950 --> 01:18:40,270
most funds do not truly hedge.
And by hedge,

1224
01:18:41,740 --> 01:18:44,320
that means taking a position,

1225
01:18:44,610 --> 01:18:49,610
say buying apple stock or
selling gold or whatever it is,

1226
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:55,280
and then simultaneously executing another
transaction that will protect you if

1227
01:18:56,371 --> 01:19:00,260
you're wrong about the first. Um, um,

1228
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:05,190
so yeah, most hedge funds don't hedge. Um,

1229
01:19:07,140 --> 01:19:08,490
even though they think they are,

1230
01:19:08,491 --> 01:19:12,750
that there are various strategies
like being long and short, but um,

1231
01:19:13,890 --> 01:19:18,780
yeah, they, they're hedge funds
in, in name only. Uh, not,

1232
01:19:18,810 --> 01:19:19,800
not in fact.

1233
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:23,153
Okay.

1234
01:19:23,380 --> 01:19:27,630
Let me grab another, another
question. Open up another card.

1235
01:19:27,830 --> 01:19:32,010
We just called this the park or debt. This
the stack. Yeah. The conversation. Right.

1236
01:19:32,011 --> 01:19:34,590
We have the rapid fire questions,
many of which we hit the last episodes.

1237
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:38,430
We're not going to, uh, we're not
going to beat those to death, but,

1238
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:44,340
okay. Uh, I'm gonna, I'm
gonna pick a new one. Oh,

1239
01:19:44,341 --> 01:19:49,010
come on. Come on. I'm not
afraid. This question, I,

1240
01:19:49,110 --> 01:19:54,050
I'm not this, this is ridiculous. This
is a presumptive question. I didn't away.

1241
01:19:54,390 --> 01:19:55,380
I didn't,
I didn't write this.

1242
01:19:55,381 --> 01:19:59,400
Why is it suspicious when
your lover starts talking
baby talk. That's ludicrous.

1243
01:19:59,430 --> 01:20:01,800
I actually have Chris, let me pick
it. Let me pick a different one.

1244
01:20:03,940 --> 01:20:08,670
When have you lost your way? Oh, well,

1245
01:20:08,770 --> 01:20:13,310
I, I think I lost my way years ago.

1246
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:18,140
I think I only found my
way this last year. Um, and

1247
01:20:19,970 --> 01:20:20,870
again,
it was,

1248
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:25,490
it was getting out of myself and
realizing it's all about the other person.

1249
01:20:26,210 --> 01:20:29,870
Um, you know, by way of metaphor

1250
01:20:32,890 --> 01:20:35,830
to create an electric circuit,
you need

1251
01:20:37,770 --> 01:20:41,080
to, you, you can't do it
alone. Right? And when you,

1252
01:20:41,110 --> 01:20:45,310
when you're charged with another
person, um, you, you, you,

1253
01:20:45,370 --> 01:20:49,360
you open up a cosmic circuit. I
don't, it's very hard to explain.

1254
01:20:49,750 --> 01:20:53,940
Um, but I've seen it in
real time and, and, uh, you,

1255
01:20:53,941 --> 01:20:57,010
you create magic. And, um, so I'm,

1256
01:20:57,970 --> 01:21:02,510
I'm on the hunt for it all
the time. I'm, I'm, I'm, um,

1257
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:04,330
I'm on the hunt for magic.

1258
01:21:05,170 --> 01:21:08,890
So let's, let's talk about that
hunt for s for a second or a,

1259
01:21:09,230 --> 01:21:12,510
a potentially related tangent.
Sure.

1260
01:21:13,230 --> 01:21:15,690
At some point over the last two days,
you said,

1261
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:20,430
let's talk about stoicism
and then you mentioned, uh,

1262
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:21,840
you mentioned hedonism.

1263
01:21:22,290 --> 01:21:25,780
And so I'm going to let you run with
that and you got what you were requested.

1264
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:28,170
I was hoping for Molly's right next to me.

1265
01:21:31,410 --> 01:21:34,240
Um, so, so stoicism,

1266
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:37,510
which is an enlightened philosophy,

1267
01:21:37,511 --> 01:21:42,400
but at the same time that stoicism
all Molly, yeah, you can't see this,

1268
01:21:42,401 --> 01:21:46,430
but I'm getting, I'm getting links
from Molly here. Sweet dog. Um,

1269
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:51,820
um, hedonism in modern culture has, uh,

1270
01:21:52,450 --> 01:21:56,420
the pursuit of pleasure, physical
pleasure, but in fact, it was a,

1271
01:21:56,460 --> 01:22:01,460
it was a profound Greek philosophy that
originated simultaneously roughly three

1272
01:22:02,261 --> 01:22:05,620
50 BC, uh, with, uh, with stoicism.

1273
01:22:06,070 --> 01:22:09,790
And it was the pursuit of pleasure,
but for them,

1274
01:22:09,791 --> 01:22:13,840
the highest pleasure was a spiritual
pleasure and intellectual pleasure.

1275
01:22:13,841 --> 01:22:16,240
And for me,
the highest pleasure is,

1276
01:22:16,660 --> 01:22:20,920
is creating delight for the other person.
Um,

1277
01:22:22,060 --> 01:22:22,960
so,
so I'm a,

1278
01:22:22,961 --> 01:22:27,640
I'm a hedonist about creating
delight and magic for others.

1279
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:31,950
Um, and, um, so to go back, I,

1280
01:22:32,010 --> 01:22:33,520
I'm forgetting what the question is now.

1281
01:22:33,670 --> 01:22:34,451
It wasn't really a question,

1282
01:22:34,451 --> 01:22:37,180
it was more of a statement that I wanted
you to come at them. Maybe you're a,

1283
01:22:37,310 --> 01:22:40,900
you know, with soap, pathetically
hedonistic, stoic, well, maybe yes,

1284
01:22:41,020 --> 01:22:42,810
but like I admire the story yo x,

1285
01:22:42,810 --> 01:22:43,321
but for me,

1286
01:22:43,321 --> 01:22:48,321
the stoics are stoics are impassive,

1287
01:22:48,930 --> 01:22:51,180
impassive,
meaning not feeling and to,

1288
01:22:51,181 --> 01:22:55,980
to greet a success and failure
with indifference. And, and,

1289
01:22:56,040 --> 01:23:00,760
and I disagree. I believe
life should be celebrated. Um,

1290
01:23:01,020 --> 01:23:04,500
and the stoics, for me, and again,
they're enlightened or alias and Seneca,

1291
01:23:04,530 --> 01:23:05,363
these are

1292
01:23:06,550 --> 01:23:10,000
such wise people. Um, but,

1293
01:23:11,170 --> 01:23:15,370
but for me, there's something lacking
in, in, in stoicism because it's a,

1294
01:23:16,090 --> 01:23:18,790
to go back to our,
our earlier choice,

1295
01:23:19,180 --> 01:23:23,170
it's playing not to lose as
opposed to playing to win.

1296
01:23:23,650 --> 01:23:28,650
And we are physical creatures
on this plane to delight.

1297
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:34,180
Um,
and I think that's what life is all about,

1298
01:23:34,210 --> 01:23:38,230
creating delight for others.
And in doing so,

1299
01:23:39,190 --> 01:23:42,780
you have the light for
yourself. Um, and um,

1300
01:23:42,970 --> 01:23:46,520
which is why I joked on stage and you
know, Jassa greed, you know, I said, I'm,

1301
01:23:46,521 --> 01:23:51,400
I'm the world's best gift giver and I,
I came here bearing gifts for you. And,

1302
01:23:51,401 --> 01:23:55,310
uh, I'm really, really
excited because, uh,

1303
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:59,740
my pen Pal Warren Buffet, I'm, I'm,
uh, I'm creating a gift for him.

1304
01:23:59,741 --> 01:24:04,450
He keeps encouraging me to write,
uh, cause he sends the stuff I write,

1305
01:24:04,470 --> 01:24:09,220
he sends it on to his friends. And,
um, and so I'm, I'm writing a book,

1306
01:24:09,730 --> 01:24:12,850
um,
that I started right after our podcast,

1307
01:24:13,460 --> 01:24:17,170
a parable and I'm, I'm, I'm
rushing to finish it because, uh,

1308
01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:21,280
I'm going to see them on the
19th, um, in a couple of weeks.

1309
01:24:21,550 --> 01:24:26,230
So I have a week to finish
this bloody thing. And give
it to him as a present. Um,

1310
01:24:26,830 --> 01:24:30,400
and I, I'm, I'm really
excited about the book. Um,

1311
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:35,350
I get such delight giving away presence.
Uh,

1312
01:24:35,490 --> 01:24:39,420
and people don't realize I'm totally
selfish because I'm the one relishing and

1313
01:24:39,421 --> 01:24:41,280
enjoying it.
Whatever pleasure they get,

1314
01:24:41,281 --> 01:24:42,990
nowhere close to what
I'm getting out of it.

1315
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:48,610
And I think that also,
whether it's hedonism or stoicism,

1316
01:24:48,611 --> 01:24:49,840
that those are in fact

1317
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:56,520
large umbrellas under which there are
many different species and a derivative

1318
01:24:59,860 --> 01:25:04,800
types of stoicism or hedonism,
sex almost. Right? Right.

1319
01:25:04,810 --> 01:25:07,630
Yeah. So if you look at say
stoicism, there are those who would,

1320
01:25:09,070 --> 01:25:12,670
who might talk about the practice
of stoic joy, which is joy,

1321
01:25:12,671 --> 01:25:17,671
but a joy that is not in tandem with a
commensurate emotional overreaction to

1322
01:25:20,201 --> 01:25:22,300
negative events. But I've
always, for instance,

1323
01:25:22,301 --> 01:25:25,840
one of the things that I've always
thought, well, you know, if I,

1324
01:25:25,841 --> 01:25:30,280
if I'm say 80% s stoic,

1325
01:25:30,310 --> 01:25:34,510
let's just say for, for the sake of
thought exercise, if I were 80% stoke,

1326
01:25:34,511 --> 01:25:39,220
what would the other 20% B and
with Seneca did,

1327
01:25:39,221 --> 01:25:43,680
which is actually what's in, in a
way what Charles Darwin did with, um,

1328
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:48,390
to, to effectively hater
proof or critic proof. Uh,

1329
01:25:49,490 --> 01:25:49,870
his,

1330
01:25:49,870 --> 01:25:54,870
his writing was to insert his
position of his staunch as opponents.

1331
01:25:57,720 --> 01:25:59,900
Yes. In a, not only plausible,

1332
01:25:59,901 --> 01:26:02,880
but almost complimentary
way in his own work.

1333
01:26:02,881 --> 01:26:07,881
So Seneca knowingness as a
incredible order and also just,

1334
01:26:08,470 --> 01:26:12,890
uh, w what do we need to color red
or addition or a debater? And so on.

1335
01:26:14,420 --> 01:26:15,141
Took a,

1336
01:26:15,141 --> 01:26:20,141
he was his letters in his letters to Luke
Ileus when of his students who he knew

1337
01:26:20,901 --> 01:26:22,580
was a fan of Epicurus.

1338
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:28,240
He would take choice tidbits of Epicurus
of the epicurean school and insert them

1339
01:26:29,361 --> 01:26:33,410
into his own letters, the moral
letters to Lucilius and, uh, and the,

1340
01:26:33,411 --> 01:26:38,300
the epicureans and a lot of ways we're
viewed as being the opposite. The stoics,

1341
01:26:38,390 --> 01:26:38,780
they were,

1342
01:26:38,780 --> 01:26:41,900
they were happy to tend their gardens
and they focused on the little pleasures.

1343
01:26:41,901 --> 01:26:44,870
And I'm simplifying it here,
but I always thought, well,

1344
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:47,660
he did such a good job of embedding those,

1345
01:26:47,661 --> 01:26:51,860
that I would probably be at least
10% epicurean. And then the last 10%,

1346
01:26:51,890 --> 01:26:54,830
maybe that's,
maybe that's a some type of,

1347
01:26:57,260 --> 01:27:02,260
some type of a sympathetic hedonist or
at least maybe that's the aspiration.

1348
01:27:02,451 --> 01:27:06,500
Yeah. Uh, are there
any particular, you've,

1349
01:27:06,530 --> 01:27:09,670
you're a very widely read human being.

1350
01:27:09,671 --> 01:27:14,290
Are there any particular philosophers
who draw your attention or who you wish

1351
01:27:14,770 --> 01:27:18,800
people would pay more attention to or,
I realize this is a lot of commas. Uh,

1352
01:27:18,980 --> 01:27:21,820
if you had to prescribe,
say,

1353
01:27:22,870 --> 01:27:27,870
high school seniors to become familiar
with one or more philosophers,

1354
01:27:29,170 --> 01:27:33,160
do any, any names or even
schools come to mind? Oh Gee.

1355
01:27:33,430 --> 01:27:38,230
Um, could just be thinkers. It
doesn't have to be philosophers.

1356
01:27:38,260 --> 01:27:40,540
Right. Well, I mean, I mentioned this,

1357
01:27:40,780 --> 01:27:43,600
you asked a similar question
at the 92nd street y and I,

1358
01:27:44,440 --> 01:27:48,610
I'm going to start just to buy
myself a little time as I, as I,

1359
01:27:48,670 --> 01:27:53,140
I searched my memory for philosophers
that I would broadly recommend is Rumi,

1360
01:27:53,141 --> 01:27:56,920
the poet Rumi. And the wonderful
thing about Rumi as a poet,

1361
01:27:56,921 --> 01:27:59,530
and he was also a philosopher, is, um,

1362
01:28:01,170 --> 01:28:05,320
as he gets you in touch with the
magical and the mysterious and,

1363
01:28:05,770 --> 01:28:08,680
and I think we need to
be in touch with that,

1364
01:28:08,681 --> 01:28:12,670
all of us in everyday life.
Um,

1365
01:28:13,510 --> 01:28:16,660
and so I would say that,
um,

1366
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:22,540
the, I would read Plato, um,

1367
01:28:22,750 --> 01:28:26,590
because Plato in the dialogues would,

1368
01:28:28,270 --> 01:28:32,950
would create an, an an interlocutor, a,
he would start arguing against himself.

1369
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:37,900
Um, and again, in, in philosophical
discourse and in your own reasoning,

1370
01:28:38,590 --> 01:28:42,070
you have to place yourself
in the position of the other.

1371
01:28:42,940 --> 01:28:44,860
And if there was one theme today,

1372
01:28:45,870 --> 01:28:50,870
and certainly in my life in
2016 and moving forward in
my life is the importance

1373
01:28:51,301 --> 01:28:55,800
of the other. And, and
what is he or she thinking,

1374
01:28:56,240 --> 01:29:01,170
uh, or what does he or she want as
opposed to what I want or what I think.

1375
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:05,910
And, um, and by the way, you
have to do this in chess. Um,

1376
01:29:07,290 --> 01:29:08,123
you know,
you're,

1377
01:29:08,130 --> 01:29:12,060
you're playing against an opponent
who also has plans in fact plans

1378
01:29:12,270 --> 01:29:16,200
diametrically opposed to
yours. Um, and so you,

1379
01:29:16,260 --> 01:29:21,000
it's well to take the other person, uh, in
mind and, and, and what they're planning.

1380
01:29:23,220 --> 01:29:27,420
We're going to jump back to that
bookmark that I sat a while ago,

1381
01:29:28,640 --> 01:29:33,120
the depressive ongoing depressive period,
intermittent episodes.

1382
01:29:33,330 --> 01:29:36,570
And then about a decade ago
or so, lifting, uh, lifting.

1383
01:29:37,740 --> 01:29:41,610
Did anything correspond to that? Well,
there any things you introduced or,

1384
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:44,230
I think there was at
that point in my life,

1385
01:29:44,231 --> 01:29:47,890
so this is 20 2007 I,

1386
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:50,560
I just made an abrupt decision to

1387
01:29:51,740 --> 01:29:52,340
okay.

1388
01:29:52,340 --> 01:29:55,900
To move away from everything in the past,
um,

1389
01:29:55,940 --> 01:30:00,170
that I had made many mistakes. Gosh, I've
made so many mistakes in my life, but,

1390
01:30:00,470 --> 01:30:02,880
but to, to, to,

1391
01:30:02,900 --> 01:30:07,700
to re to go back to first
principles and fundamentals and,

1392
01:30:08,210 --> 01:30:12,860
and, uh, and by the way, I
turned my back on, on, on,

1393
01:30:12,980 --> 01:30:17,870
on, on a couple of successful careers
and, and decided to embark on,

1394
01:30:18,020 --> 01:30:20,780
on a new one and to set myself up as a

1395
01:30:22,430 --> 01:30:26,790
advisor to two major
hedge funds. And, uh, um,

1396
01:30:27,320 --> 01:30:29,150
so I,
I think it was a decision,

1397
01:30:29,151 --> 01:30:34,151
a break from the past and
in it and a conscious one.

1398
01:30:35,420 --> 01:30:40,100
And I think that was,
that was the marker only

1399
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:44,940
on a, let's just say you, you decide
that on a macro level to break from the,

1400
01:30:45,470 --> 01:30:47,530
yeah.
The past and many things in the past.

1401
01:30:48,520 --> 01:30:52,480
Let's say you do that after
dinner one day you go to bed.

1402
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:54,280
How was your next day different?

1403
01:30:55,330 --> 01:30:59,470
Are you separating yourself from
contact with certain people?

1404
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:04,390
Are you identifying when
old thought patterns come up
and stopping and trying to

1405
01:31:04,391 --> 01:31:07,210
replace them? What, what
is, what is the difference?

1406
01:31:07,510 --> 01:31:12,160
Well, you know, what the differences
are you, we talked about it when, when,

1407
01:31:12,161 --> 01:31:16,810
when we were walking Molly
earlier. So, um, again,

1408
01:31:16,870 --> 01:31:21,380
you're listening, so you, you the,
the, the, the, the, the, the audience.

1409
01:31:21,540 --> 01:31:26,500
You just, uh, you have to imagine
this. We're walking Molly on,

1410
01:31:26,501 --> 01:31:30,810
on the streets of San
Francisco and, uh, in, uh, in,

1411
01:31:30,811 --> 01:31:35,811
in a wonderful Selvin Canyon and Clave,

1412
01:31:36,450 --> 01:31:40,940
uh, that, that I've never known
about and where anyway, uh,

1413
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:45,320
Tim resides. And so we're
walking Molly and, uh,

1414
01:31:46,470 --> 01:31:46,810
yeah,

1415
01:31:46,810 --> 01:31:49,450
Molly, when we're walking on
the left side of the street,

1416
01:31:49,451 --> 01:31:53,590
you always want Molly away from the
traffic. And so we're walking along and,

1417
01:31:54,300 --> 01:31:57,010
and on, on the left side, Molly is okay,

1418
01:31:57,011 --> 01:31:59,320
but when we switched to the
other side of the street,

1419
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:03,550
Molly has to be on your right side,
which is again,

1420
01:32:03,820 --> 01:32:08,020
away from the traffic.
And, and Molly, again,

1421
01:32:08,021 --> 01:32:12,990
this is by way of metaphor you
said that Molly is, is more,

1422
01:32:13,610 --> 01:32:15,200
it's a little more awkward for her.

1423
01:32:15,201 --> 01:32:16,890
So she's got to be a
little more conscious and,

1424
01:32:17,070 --> 01:32:20,780
and thoughtful about what she does when
we're walking on the right side of the

1425
01:32:20,781 --> 01:32:24,620
street. And when I made a
conscious break to end, uh,

1426
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:29,720
I mean I ended a relationship and I ended
a business and sided start a new and,

1427
01:32:33,021 --> 01:32:35,870
um, you become conscious, you know,

1428
01:32:35,871 --> 01:32:39,860
I think too much of our lives
aren't automatic pilot and,

1429
01:32:39,890 --> 01:32:44,890
and so like Molly walking on the
right side of the street just,

1430
01:32:45,431 --> 01:32:47,840
uh, it's, it's a little different for her,

1431
01:32:47,841 --> 01:32:51,530
so she becomes conscious of
everything she does. And I think,

1432
01:32:52,690 --> 01:32:53,170
okay,

1433
01:32:53,170 --> 01:32:57,880
that's really important to, to be,
to live consciously and mindfully.

1434
01:32:58,330 --> 01:33:02,110
And one way to do that is
to get yourself out of, um,

1435
01:33:03,250 --> 01:33:06,470
old ways of being, um, take a,

1436
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:09,790
a new path to work.
Um,

1437
01:33:10,010 --> 01:33:14,510
I'm not saying you should
be dramatic and an end,

1438
01:33:14,511 --> 01:33:19,280
everything is, I didn't start
a new, but, um, you can, uh,

1439
01:33:19,790 --> 01:33:23,870
you can make little choices and again,
to live mindfully and consciously.

1440
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:25,153
Um,

1441
01:33:26,410 --> 01:33:28,270
yeah, so that, that's uh, the,

1442
01:33:29,530 --> 01:33:34,530
the decision you made and you've pointed
out some very cool word origins or,

1443
01:33:36,370 --> 01:33:39,790
uh, I should say word components
at the very least. No, his mic up,

1444
01:33:39,791 --> 01:33:43,330
mix up etymology and entomology,
but I'm pretty sure the etymology,

1445
01:33:44,350 --> 01:33:49,150
we're not talking about if we're eating
Paleo for instance, what would we,

1446
01:33:49,151 --> 01:33:52,840
what would a new replacement
for companion be if companion,

1447
01:33:53,320 --> 01:33:54,460
which if you were to look at this,

1448
01:33:54,550 --> 01:33:58,660
let's just say since I don't speak Latin
Spanish combined with bread, with bread,

1449
01:33:58,690 --> 01:33:59,920
breaking bread with someone else,
you know,

1450
01:33:59,921 --> 01:34:03,970
what would the paleo equivalent of that
be or matrix the fact that if you look

1451
01:34:03,971 --> 01:34:08,380
at Matriarch or matrimony, uh,
there, there's a mother component,

1452
01:34:08,381 --> 01:34:13,290
mother related, uh, the, the
decision you made. And uh,

1453
01:34:13,340 --> 01:34:16,960
I might be making this up,
but I don't think I am making it up.

1454
01:34:17,170 --> 01:34:20,710
Incision decision to cut away.
Yes.

1455
01:34:20,711 --> 01:34:25,420
A cutting away to decide is to
cut, to cut away incision. Correct.

1456
01:34:25,450 --> 01:34:30,040
So the cutting away of relationship
business, all of these things,

1457
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:35,680
if, well, I shouldn't,
I shouldn't project,

1458
01:34:35,710 --> 01:34:37,840
but for myself to do something like that,

1459
01:34:38,510 --> 01:34:40,990
it's very often something
I know I need to do.

1460
01:34:40,991 --> 01:34:45,430
It's something that on many levels I
want to do, but I put it off for a very,

1461
01:34:45,431 --> 01:34:47,810
very long time. I get
close and then I, sure,

1462
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:50,440
then I flinch and then
I go back to my easier,

1463
01:34:50,590 --> 01:34:53,680
automatic way of doing things
or the devil that I know,

1464
01:34:53,710 --> 01:34:57,040
the comforts that I'm afraid to
replace because of the unknown.

1465
01:34:58,760 --> 01:35:02,900
What led you to get to the point and
was there a certain conversation,

1466
01:35:02,901 --> 01:35:04,940
a certain journaling exercise,
was there?

1467
01:35:05,270 --> 01:35:10,170
What led you to finally make the
Drager and make the break? I,

1468
01:35:10,580 --> 01:35:12,180
I think you just realize that,
um,

1469
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:16,333
okay.

1470
01:35:17,350 --> 01:35:19,480
For me, I mean, it's different
for each person. You just,

1471
01:35:20,110 --> 01:35:22,940
whether you're being authentic and,

1472
01:35:23,030 --> 01:35:27,850
and I realized I wasn't being authentic
and I had to make a break and, and, and,

1473
01:35:27,851 --> 01:35:31,180
um, and start a new life. And, and, um,

1474
01:35:31,960 --> 01:35:36,140
and so I think authenticity
is a big thing. Um,

1475
01:35:39,320 --> 01:35:43,990
it's hard to be authentic
and, and, uh, but it's,

1476
01:35:44,360 --> 01:35:49,360
and their challenges and, and, and, uh,
I was going to say risks, but I, again,

1477
01:35:49,361 --> 01:35:49,931
to go back,

1478
01:35:49,931 --> 01:35:53,500
I don't know that there are risks if you
play a game and the game is all about

1479
01:35:54,160 --> 01:35:57,630
creating fun and a light for
everyone around you. And, uh,

1480
01:35:58,840 --> 01:36:02,870
you know, this reminds me of a joke. Um,

1481
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:07,530
so, uh, I don't know if
you've heard this one.

1482
01:36:07,740 --> 01:36:10,680
So guy walks into a bar and a,
by the way,

1483
01:36:10,681 --> 01:36:13,500
this is a profound philosophical
point that I'll make,

1484
01:36:14,310 --> 01:36:17,880
but it'll only become clear once
I tell you the joke. So, um,

1485
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:22,080
this guy walks into a bar and, um, and uh,

1486
01:36:22,140 --> 01:36:24,690
it goes into the bar tender and orders
a drink. And the bartender looks at me,

1487
01:36:24,710 --> 01:36:28,500
goes, I, I haven't seen you
in the bar before. Yeah.

1488
01:36:29,610 --> 01:36:33,480
Uh, and the bar, the, the, the,
the customer says, well, no, I'm,

1489
01:36:33,481 --> 01:36:36,550
I just came to town. And the
bartender goes, oh, whoa,

1490
01:36:36,551 --> 01:36:39,930
what brings you town and what do
you do? And he says, I'm a gambler.

1491
01:36:40,860 --> 01:36:45,270
And the bartender says, really?
And, uh, and, and he says, yeah,

1492
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:50,040
I, uh, I'm a Gambler, a professional
gamblers, what I do for a living.

1493
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:53,130
And the bartender goes, really?
You can make a living at
that? And he says, uh, yeah,

1494
01:36:53,190 --> 01:36:57,150
I never lose. And the bartender
goes, oh, Kimmy, a break.

1495
01:36:57,570 --> 01:37:01,830
And the the gambler guy, or the customer
says, yeah, no, I've never, I don't lose.

1496
01:37:02,610 --> 01:37:07,470
And, um, so, uh, the bartender goes, okay,

1497
01:37:07,710 --> 01:37:12,570
uh, give me an example. Let
that make me a bet. And so,

1498
01:37:12,571 --> 01:37:17,340
uh, the customer says, uh, to the, the
bartender, look, I'm warning you, I'm a,

1499
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:20,790
I'm a professional gambler.
I just warn you that I never lose.

1500
01:37:20,791 --> 01:37:25,020
Are you sure you want to do this? And the
bartender goes, absolutely. And he says,

1501
01:37:25,021 --> 01:37:28,770
okay, uh, I'll bet you $50.

1502
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:35,010
Hold on. I gotta make sure I get
this bet right. I bet you $50 that

1503
01:37:36,690 --> 01:37:39,910
I can, um, bite my left eye.

1504
01:37:42,070 --> 01:37:46,840
And the bartender rolls his eyes and slams
down 50 bucks, then it goes, you're on,

1505
01:37:47,920 --> 01:37:52,810
you're on. And um, so,
uh, the, uh, the, the, uh,

1506
01:37:54,360 --> 01:37:57,990
the gambler guy out his
left eye and bites it

1507
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:04,530
in his mouth and, and, and pops it
back in and the bartender is furious,

1508
01:38:04,531 --> 01:38:09,240
but the gambler guy says, I, I warned
you and scoops up the money. And, um,

1509
01:38:10,370 --> 01:38:15,360
and, and the, and the, uh, have you heard
this one before? Oh, okay. So, um, again,

1510
01:38:15,361 --> 01:38:18,660
the path is really funny and then I'll
make the philosophical point about life.

1511
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:23,970
And, um, so, uh, the bartender
goes, okay, give me another chance.

1512
01:38:24,270 --> 01:38:28,350
And, and the gamma guy says, look, I,
I'm a professional. I just warn you,

1513
01:38:28,351 --> 01:38:32,130
I just took $50.
Are you sure you want to do this?

1514
01:38:32,220 --> 01:38:35,250
And the bartender goes, yeah,
give me another chance. And the,

1515
01:38:35,490 --> 01:38:36,960
and the gambler guy says,
okay,

1516
01:38:37,770 --> 01:38:41,550
I'll bet you another $50
that I can bite my other eye.

1517
01:38:43,140 --> 01:38:46,050
And the bartender goes,
wait a second. Okay,

1518
01:38:46,051 --> 01:38:48,690
I missed the fact that
that one I was glass,

1519
01:38:49,260 --> 01:38:54,120
but there's no way that you're blind. I
know you don't have to glass eyes. Okay,

1520
01:38:54,140 --> 01:38:57,420
you're bros down 50 box.
And by the way,

1521
01:38:57,480 --> 01:39:02,130
other patrons are now circling around
watching what's going on and egging the

1522
01:39:02,131 --> 01:39:04,040
bartender on.
And um,

1523
01:39:05,010 --> 01:39:07,380
so the gambler guy takes
out his dentures and,

1524
01:39:07,550 --> 01:39:12,300
and gently bites his eye, the other
eye with the, with his dentures.

1525
01:39:12,570 --> 01:39:16,890
And the bartender is steaming
now because he's lost two bats.

1526
01:39:16,920 --> 01:39:20,640
He's furious. And, uh, the
gamma guy says, I want you.

1527
01:39:22,110 --> 01:39:25,440
And Anyway, the Gambler guy throughout
the evening is getting drunk.

1528
01:39:25,441 --> 01:39:28,860
He's buying drinks for everybody.
He goes to the back of the bar. Um,

1529
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:32,310
and then he comes back to
the bartender and says, look,

1530
01:39:32,311 --> 01:39:35,730
I'm going to make it up to you.
I'll make another bet.

1531
01:39:36,450 --> 01:39:40,920
And now the whole premise of the whole bar
is around him. And, um, and so he says,

1532
01:39:41,010 --> 01:39:46,010
I'll bet you $500 that I can stand
on this bar right here on the bar.

1533
01:39:47,990 --> 01:39:51,870
Uh, stand up on one leg and you
see that vodka bottle behind you.

1534
01:39:52,050 --> 01:39:56,610
I can pee into that bottle and not
a drop of PE will go anywhere else.

1535
01:39:56,640 --> 01:39:59,670
But that bottle and the
parts in the course,

1536
01:39:59,940 --> 01:40:04,500
there is no way that that's going
to have any, a puts down 500 bucks.

1537
01:40:04,501 --> 01:40:06,960
And so as the gambler guy, so
the gambler guy, and by the way,

1538
01:40:06,961 --> 01:40:09,000
he's pretty drunk at this point.
He can barely stand up.

1539
01:40:09,150 --> 01:40:13,410
He gets up at the top
of the bar, um, uh, uh,

1540
01:40:13,470 --> 01:40:16,290
pulls it out and pees everywhere.

1541
01:40:16,291 --> 01:40:20,970
But the bod cabal pees all
over the bartender and the
bartender is laughing his

1542
01:40:20,971 --> 01:40:25,860
head off and, and so is everyone
else, right? And, uh, and the, uh,

1543
01:40:26,250 --> 01:40:28,880
the guy, the Gamba guy gets
a, you know, it does this,

1544
01:40:28,881 --> 01:40:31,550
finish this business and gets
down off the bar and, and the,

1545
01:40:31,551 --> 01:40:35,860
and the bartender triumphantly
grabs the, the 500 bucks, uh,

1546
01:40:35,940 --> 01:40:40,270
from the, the Gamma Guy. And
he says, ah, Ha, I, uh, I, uh,

1547
01:40:40,350 --> 01:40:44,940
thought she never lose. And the Gamma
Guy says, uh, I didn't. He said,

1548
01:40:44,941 --> 01:40:48,870
what do you mean I just took $500 from
you? And he said, uh, the Gamer guy says,

1549
01:40:48,871 --> 01:40:51,570
yeah, but you see that table, those
guys back there, those costs guys,

1550
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:56,710
I bet them $2,000 that I could stand
up on this Barn, pee all over you.

1551
01:40:56,711 --> 01:41:01,120
And not only would you not object,
you'd be laughing when I did it. And,

1552
01:41:01,660 --> 01:41:06,550
and so, so, so the interesting thing
there, tie, we'll talk about a hedged bet,

1553
01:41:06,551 --> 01:41:09,310
right? The, as we were talking
about hedge funds earlier,

1554
01:41:09,850 --> 01:41:12,980
is that the power off is a,

1555
01:41:13,990 --> 01:41:17,910
there's a huge payoff.
He lost. Okay. The 500.

1556
01:41:17,911 --> 01:41:20,850
But there was a much bigger payoff.
And in life,

1557
01:41:21,870 --> 01:41:26,640
if your focus is on the other person
and delighting the other person,

1558
01:41:27,030 --> 01:41:31,290
again, whether it's a job interview
or a relationship, a date,

1559
01:41:31,320 --> 01:41:35,610
or you're looking to get funding for
your startup or pee all over him and give

1560
01:41:35,611 --> 01:41:38,550
him $500, right? But the payout,

1561
01:41:38,580 --> 01:41:43,320
the universe pays you
back on the back end. And,

1562
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:46,890
and, and that's a faith. So that's,

1563
01:41:47,190 --> 01:41:51,130
that's the gospel that I preach
is the gospel of the other. And,

1564
01:41:51,250 --> 01:41:55,020
and focus on the other and exclusively,

1565
01:41:55,230 --> 01:41:59,550
and you'll get tremendous
delight yourself and, and, uh,

1566
01:41:59,551 --> 01:42:03,960
and the universe has a way
of throwing you, uh, uh,

1567
01:42:03,990 --> 01:42:07,610
extra. Uh, okay.

1568
01:42:08,900 --> 01:42:11,600
So much more than you could think.
And I'll give you an example of magic.

1569
01:42:11,990 --> 01:42:16,520
And I said before the, the, the, uh,
it's something I stop me if I said this,

1570
01:42:16,550 --> 01:42:17,310
the nice secretary.

1571
01:42:17,310 --> 01:42:21,290
Why did I talk about getting a present
for Warren Buffet and then, and then, uh,

1572
01:42:21,340 --> 01:42:26,110
the, the gallery. Okay. So,
so I, I, uh, I create, uh,

1573
01:42:26,720 --> 01:42:29,270
a Christmas present for Warren Buffet.
I want to send it to him. Right.

1574
01:42:30,530 --> 01:42:32,420
And my pen pal. And, uh,

1575
01:42:33,080 --> 01:42:38,080
and so I created a framed
pack of Beeman's gum,

1576
01:42:40,250 --> 01:42:41,780
which used to sell as a child.

1577
01:42:42,920 --> 01:42:47,550
And so it took me the Beeman's gum for
those of you who don't know, Eh, um,

1578
01:42:48,860 --> 01:42:52,580
the company that made Beeman's gum went
out of business about a decade ago.

1579
01:42:54,110 --> 01:42:58,390
And, uh, and Warren Buffet
when he was a child,

1580
01:42:58,550 --> 01:43:00,710
used to sell it and,

1581
01:43:01,940 --> 01:43:06,640
and I tracked down on the
Internet a candy collector and,

1582
01:43:07,160 --> 01:43:12,160
and asked him if he had a pack of
Beeman's gum from like 50 years ago,

1583
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:17,140
like, like an old ancient pack. And he
said, I might in my warehouse in Montana.

1584
01:43:17,141 --> 01:43:21,820
And sure enough, he found it and I said,
I'll pay any price for it. I bought it.

1585
01:43:22,450 --> 01:43:27,310
And then I had a calligrapher right. From
small beginnings. Anyway, I had a framed

1586
01:43:28,840 --> 01:43:32,080
pack of gum that I was going to
send a Warren Buffett for Christmas.

1587
01:43:32,860 --> 01:43:35,890
So this is December 20 20th or so.
And I'm in,

1588
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:39,020
I'm in the gallery and in
Tribeca and the gallery owner.

1589
01:43:39,021 --> 01:43:43,090
See Your City New York City. Yes. I'm
sorry. And, um, the gallery owner says,

1590
01:43:43,210 --> 01:43:46,810
do you like the frame? It
just been framed. And I said,
Oh, this is so beautiful.

1591
01:43:46,811 --> 01:43:47,860
He's just going to love this.

1592
01:43:48,180 --> 01:43:51,470
[inaudible] she doesn't know who I am
and doesn't know who this is going to.

1593
01:43:51,471 --> 01:43:55,760
It doesn't say for anybody.
And um, and I said, oh,

1594
01:43:56,000 --> 01:44:00,680
how am I going to get this to
Nebraska?

1595
01:44:02,330 --> 01:44:06,230
And she said, what do you mean?
I said, well, if I send it FedEx,

1596
01:44:06,710 --> 01:44:10,970
I don't care how many times I bubble
wrap at the gum will fall off the frame.

1597
01:44:10,970 --> 01:44:14,630
Like it'll fall off the backing.
That's shadow box shadow box. Right.

1598
01:44:14,870 --> 01:44:19,850
And I thought, oh, it's going to,
it has to be couriered. And I said,

1599
01:44:19,851 --> 01:44:21,950
how am I going to get it there? And
she said, oh, I'll take care of that.

1600
01:44:22,490 --> 01:44:26,990
And I said, oh, great. You know, a
delivery service. And she said, uh,

1601
01:44:28,480 --> 01:44:31,280
that'll liver presently. She said, yeah,
I'll take care of it. I said, well,

1602
01:44:31,281 --> 01:44:33,830
what delivery service? Cause I'd like to
know, just for future reference. She said,

1603
01:44:33,890 --> 01:44:38,600
Oh, I'm sorry, I don't think
I'll deliver this personally.

1604
01:44:39,560 --> 01:44:42,230
I said, what? I squinted at her.
I said, what? She said, yeah,

1605
01:44:42,231 --> 01:44:46,460
I'll take care of this free of charge.
I said, excuse me, this is Nebraska,

1606
01:44:47,930 --> 01:44:51,640
right? It's not like going
to some fun location, like

1607
01:44:54,080 --> 01:44:56,660
with respect to those of
you who are from Nebraska,

1608
01:44:56,661 --> 01:45:01,490
I mean to get all kinds of hate mail.
Um, but for the winter it's the winner.

1609
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:04,070
It's the winter. Right,
right, right, right.

1610
01:45:04,400 --> 01:45:08,990
Why would you want to be going
to Nebraska? And um, she said,

1611
01:45:08,991 --> 01:45:11,000
she looked at me and she said,
I'll do it for free.

1612
01:45:11,900 --> 01:45:16,160
I can see how important this is to you.
And I,

1613
01:45:16,220 --> 01:45:20,720
I was so stunned and I just looked
at her young woman, maybe 28,

1614
01:45:20,721 --> 01:45:25,100
29. And I said, um, I said, you
know, I can't let you do that.

1615
01:45:25,101 --> 01:45:28,370
That's the best gift anyone's ever given
me. And I'm the world's best gift giver.

1616
01:45:28,640 --> 01:45:33,440
And here I was like, I like,
like ya'll one up. I got one up.

1617
01:45:34,010 --> 01:45:38,570
And I said, uh, I said, oh my gosh, I'm
really this kind of thing I would've said.

1618
01:45:38,960 --> 01:45:43,340
And I said, I can't let you do
that. I, I'll pay for you to do it.

1619
01:45:43,970 --> 01:45:47,840
I'm not going to ruin the magic cause
there was some impulse in you that wanted

1620
01:45:48,110 --> 01:45:51,890
to do that, to offer that to
me and I'm going to have to,

1621
01:45:52,760 --> 01:45:56,990
I'll, I'll pay for the
trip. So thank you. And,

1622
01:45:58,220 --> 01:46:02,270
and that's an example of the magic. She
didn't know who it was going to, uh,

1623
01:46:02,300 --> 01:46:03,710
didn't know who I was.

1624
01:46:04,130 --> 01:46:08,210
She just knew it was important
to me and in the, in the,

1625
01:46:08,600 --> 01:46:13,600
because I was so focused on getting this
present to someone that I cared about

1626
01:46:15,470 --> 01:46:19,070
and she could see that she
was swept into the magic.

1627
01:46:19,850 --> 01:46:23,600
And that's an example of the magic that
happens when you're just focused on

1628
01:46:23,601 --> 01:46:28,250
someone else instead of yourself
and a boy. I was humbled by that.

1629
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:33,350
I mean, wow, I'm really went up in the,
in the present giving department. Um,

1630
01:46:33,980 --> 01:46:38,180
so the magic of focusing on the
other, on the other, yeah. Yeah.

1631
01:46:39,710 --> 01:46:44,480
Well I think you're a master of,
and I didn't know the pre,

1632
01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:50,460
let's say we met, when did we first
meet? I'm not sure if it was 2014,

1633
01:46:50,460 --> 01:46:54,280
1514.
I think [inaudible] 14 through Jackson.

1634
01:46:54,330 --> 01:46:59,330
I didn't know the Adam pre 2014 but
you strike me as an expert in what,

1635
01:47:01,291 --> 01:47:06,120
another podcast guest I, Gabrielle
Reece, Gabby Reese. Sure. Going first.

1636
01:47:06,121 --> 01:47:08,280
She said go first. Yeah.
I asked her if she,

1637
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:12,270
if she had any parting request for
the audience, she should go first.

1638
01:47:12,271 --> 01:47:15,900
Meaning smile first,
make eye contact first to say hi first.

1639
01:47:16,350 --> 01:47:20,400
You're very good at that. And
I think that's part of, uh,

1640
01:47:20,610 --> 01:47:25,320
eliciting the potential magic of,
of that situation. Absolutely.

1641
01:47:25,321 --> 01:47:26,700
When you're really

1642
01:47:29,440 --> 01:47:31,540
the secret to everything

1643
01:47:33,510 --> 01:47:35,130
to creating in the world,

1644
01:47:35,880 --> 01:47:39,270
whether it's creating a
relationship or creating a business,

1645
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:41,340
I don't care what it is,

1646
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:45,540
is you have a vision of what's possible.

1647
01:47:46,930 --> 01:47:47,550
Okay.

1648
01:47:47,550 --> 01:47:48,390
And you

1649
01:47:51,780 --> 01:47:56,040
convey that vision to
the potential partner,

1650
01:47:56,700 --> 01:48:00,150
whether it's a business or a
romantic partner of what's possible.

1651
01:48:01,530 --> 01:48:02,190
And,

1652
01:48:02,190 --> 01:48:06,210
and you get them excited about it and
you get other people excited about it if

1653
01:48:06,211 --> 01:48:09,090
it's a business and so on. And, um,

1654
01:48:10,020 --> 01:48:13,290
and so yeah,
it's about having visions,

1655
01:48:13,470 --> 01:48:18,180
positive visions of what's possible.
Um, you know, and this is 2017 and I'm,

1656
01:48:18,390 --> 01:48:22,470
I think the world is in a
very perilous place right now,

1657
01:48:22,770 --> 01:48:25,080
but I'm very excited
for the world because,

1658
01:48:25,940 --> 01:48:30,410
because this is a fulcrum
moment and by fulcrum moment,

1659
01:48:30,860 --> 01:48:34,820
I mean a moment when you
can achieve great results,

1660
01:48:35,360 --> 01:48:39,980
maximally leveraging whatever
resources you've got,

1661
01:48:40,010 --> 01:48:43,240
like now is the time to act.
Um,

1662
01:48:43,430 --> 01:48:48,430
and we get fulcrum moments in our lives
as individuals and as countries and as a

1663
01:48:50,961 --> 01:48:54,770
planet. And this is a fulcrum year. Um,

1664
01:48:55,070 --> 01:48:59,420
and we all sense it,
um, that great changes,

1665
01:48:59,421 --> 01:49:03,680
positive or negative. We
gotta be careful, um, and,

1666
01:49:04,710 --> 01:49:07,230
and, and to, to seize the fulcrum moment.

1667
01:49:07,890 --> 01:49:12,510
Now is the time to press hard.
Um,

1668
01:49:12,720 --> 01:49:15,660
and I think the world's
got to do that, um, with,

1669
01:49:16,470 --> 01:49:21,030
with positive visions and excite.
Again, it's all about the other,

1670
01:49:21,750 --> 01:49:26,750
excite everyone with a positive vision
and we can create magic in the world or

1671
01:49:27,510 --> 01:49:30,240
not. And then we're in trouble. Um,

1672
01:49:30,690 --> 01:49:35,040
I'm really excited about 2017
for myself and for the world. Um,

1673
01:49:36,100 --> 01:49:36,933
yeah,

1674
01:49:38,640 --> 01:49:41,310
before we wrap up,
I think we might,

1675
01:49:41,340 --> 01:49:45,850
we might have a date with a Russian
bath. In Our Future. But, uh,

1676
01:49:45,870 --> 01:49:48,610
before we close the conversation,

1677
01:49:48,790 --> 01:49:52,810
do you have any parting
requests for the audience?

1678
01:49:52,840 --> 01:49:55,750
Questions for the audience,
suggestions for the audience,

1679
01:49:56,230 --> 01:49:57,910
anything you'd like
them to take with them?

1680
01:49:58,620 --> 01:50:03,060
Well, that was a big one, that this
is a fulcrum a year. I'm telling you,

1681
01:50:03,061 --> 01:50:07,230
just intuitively,
I know for myself and I'm sure as a,

1682
01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:10,670
as you the listener
reflect on your life and,

1683
01:50:10,710 --> 01:50:13,320
and there are great opportunities.

1684
01:50:13,830 --> 01:50:18,830
The world is such tremendous
beauty and possibility.

1685
01:50:19,320 --> 01:50:24,220
It's so exciting right now. And, and,

1686
01:50:24,230 --> 01:50:26,900
and yet everyone's focused
on the negative and,

1687
01:50:27,330 --> 01:50:31,940
and instead focus on the other and,
and positive and creating magic,

1688
01:50:32,650 --> 01:50:37,440
uh, lean into each moment and each
encounter creating magic. And,

1689
01:50:37,441 --> 01:50:41,330
um, and by the way, that's a great
editing principle. Like when you're,

1690
01:50:41,600 --> 01:50:46,130
you're in an, you're about to
argue with a cab driver or, or,

1691
01:50:46,160 --> 01:50:50,120
or with your spouse or with
your best friend or whatever,

1692
01:50:50,630 --> 01:50:52,190
ask yourself is what you're going to say.

1693
01:50:52,191 --> 01:50:56,030
Create the light and the other person
or magic. And if not, don't say it.

1694
01:50:56,510 --> 01:50:58,130
Um,
and

1695
01:50:58,660 --> 01:51:03,250
well, I saw you do that last
night with a, uh, with a hostess.

1696
01:51:03,251 --> 01:51:06,640
At a restaurant when the restaurant was
fully booked up. It's raining outside.

1697
01:51:06,641 --> 01:51:09,190
We walk in and,
uh,

1698
01:51:10,570 --> 01:51:14,830
and in fact it wasn't we, it was just
the two of us walked in because we had,

1699
01:51:14,860 --> 01:51:18,280
we had another party with us waiting in
the Uber because we didn't think it'd be

1700
01:51:18,281 --> 01:51:20,050
possible potentially to get a table.
Right.

1701
01:51:20,200 --> 01:51:23,190
And I don't remember the
exact wording that you used,

1702
01:51:23,860 --> 01:51:28,690
but you walked up and to brand.
I remember rolling at her. Yeah.

1703
01:51:28,750 --> 01:51:29,850
And,
uh,

1704
01:51:30,160 --> 01:51:35,160
and you just walked into
the exchange opening first,

1705
01:51:35,651 --> 01:51:39,490
second, expecting us to get a
table. Right. And Lo and behold,

1706
01:51:41,410 --> 01:51:44,800
she said, I feel like your chances
are very good after, you know,

1707
01:51:44,801 --> 01:51:47,680
30 seconds of Adam turning on the charm.

1708
01:51:47,710 --> 01:51:52,240
And then I called call their whole
Party in. And a few short minutes later,

1709
01:51:52,241 --> 01:51:54,250
after some, a little bit of, uh, of,

1710
01:51:54,370 --> 01:51:59,110
of me drinking wine and all of us
drinking sparkling water, we got, uh,

1711
01:51:59,170 --> 01:52:00,490
arguably the best table in the house.

1712
01:52:00,740 --> 01:52:02,890
It was the best table in
what's the most stable now.

1713
01:52:02,990 --> 01:52:05,180
Yeah. And, uh, because,

1714
01:52:06,260 --> 01:52:06,700
okay.

1715
01:52:06,700 --> 01:52:09,510
I just couldn't, I really,
I, I still remember, um,

1716
01:52:10,310 --> 01:52:13,510
which just about creating some fun for
her and she realized we were fun people

1717
01:52:13,511 --> 01:52:17,500
and fun energy and damn straight.
She was going to give us a table.

1718
01:52:18,410 --> 01:52:20,470
Shizam yeah,

1719
01:52:21,600 --> 01:52:22,433
Adam.
Uh,

1720
01:52:23,310 --> 01:52:28,310
I always love our conversations and
many more head conversational park war.

1721
01:52:29,730 --> 01:52:31,920
Exactly right.
She'll park where,

1722
01:52:32,220 --> 01:52:36,800
which is my favorite kind of park cord
because I can't damage my knees. And uh,

1723
01:52:36,900 --> 01:52:40,740
is there any where you would like
people to learn more about you online or

1724
01:52:40,741 --> 01:52:43,980
elsewhere, website, anything else
that you'd like to mention? Well,

1725
01:52:43,981 --> 01:52:48,440
they can always get in touch with through
my website, Robinson global strategies.

1726
01:52:48,441 --> 01:52:53,441
There's a contact form there and they
want to talk about global strategy or,

1727
01:52:54,470 --> 01:52:59,250
or magic. Um, they can
always drop me a line and,

1728
01:52:59,330 --> 01:53:02,870
and uh, and I'll respond. All right,

1729
01:53:02,871 --> 01:53:06,830
well on that note,
I think this is a great place to,

1730
01:53:07,550 --> 01:53:12,290
to temporarily table this ongoing
conversation that we have.

1731
01:53:12,470 --> 01:53:16,280
Andy Puberty, listening,

1737
01:53:37,620 --> 01:53:41,040
Hey guys, this is Tim again. Just a
few more things before you take off.

1738
01:53:41,340 --> 01:53:44,010
Number one,
this is five bullet Friday.

1739
01:53:44,280 --> 01:53:47,280
Do you want to get a short email from me?

1740
01:53:47,281 --> 01:53:51,420
Would you enjoy getting a short email
from me every Friday that provides a

1741
01:53:51,421 --> 01:53:54,960
little more soul of fun before the
weekend and five bullet Friday is a very

1742
01:53:54,961 --> 01:53:59,310
short email where I share the coolest
things I've found or that I've been

1743
01:53:59,311 --> 01:54:00,630
pondering over the week.

1744
01:54:00,840 --> 01:54:03,600
That could include favorite new
albums that I've discovered.

1745
01:54:03,601 --> 01:54:07,050
It could include Gizmos and gadgets
and all sorts of weird shit that I've

1746
01:54:07,051 --> 01:54:11,400
somehow dug up in the, uh, the
world of the esoteric as I do.

1747
01:54:11,670 --> 01:54:16,670
It could include favorite articles that
I've read and that I've shared with my

1748
01:54:17,340 --> 01:54:20,040
close friends, for instance.
And it's very short.

1749
01:54:20,130 --> 01:54:25,110
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness
before you head off for the weekend.

1750
01:54:25,170 --> 01:54:27,360
So if you want to receive that,

1754
01:54:38,190 --> 01:54:40,620
This episode is brought
to you by 99 designs.

1755
01:54:40,621 --> 01:54:44,460
I've used 99 designs for years for
all sorts of graphic design needs,

1756
01:54:44,820 --> 01:54:47,400
whether you need a logo, website,
book cover, anything else.

1757
01:54:47,460 --> 01:54:51,660
99 designs was created to make great
designs accessible to everyone and to make

1758
01:54:51,661 --> 01:54:55,620
the process of getting designs much,
much easier. So when I first started out,

1759
01:54:55,890 --> 01:54:57,420
for instance,
testing,

1760
01:54:57,600 --> 01:55:00,990
prototype covers and getting prototype
covers for the four hour body,

1761
01:55:01,380 --> 01:55:04,230
I want the contest drop. That is one
option. This is a great solution.

1762
01:55:04,231 --> 01:55:05,220
If you're looking for fast,

1763
01:55:05,550 --> 01:55:09,180
affordable design work and the ability
to choose from dozens of options

1764
01:55:09,450 --> 01:55:13,020
risk-free. Let's say you need something
late night, quick turnarounds,

1765
01:55:13,050 --> 01:55:14,310
well people in other time zones,

1766
01:55:14,311 --> 01:55:17,850
other countries can also help you
solve that problem. Since then,

1767
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:18,641
I've worked with nine,

1768
01:55:18,641 --> 01:55:23,641
nine designs on a separate
path or a different option
and that is the one to one

1769
01:55:26,041 --> 01:55:30,330
project service. So in a number of
cases, and I'll give you one example,

1770
01:55:30,331 --> 01:55:34,230
when I wanted to create the cover
for my audio book, the Tao of Seneca,

1771
01:55:34,260 --> 01:55:35,640
this was a very important project to me.

1772
01:55:36,060 --> 01:55:38,940
I decided to use their one
to one project service.

1773
01:55:38,941 --> 01:55:42,120
And with this service you can invite
a specific design of your project,

1774
01:55:42,380 --> 01:55:45,050
agree on a and then work together
until you're satisfied me.

1775
01:55:45,090 --> 01:55:48,450
I need to iterate and provide feedback
and all of this stuff and I haven't

1776
01:55:48,780 --> 01:55:51,720
shared it yet,
but we also got some incredibly good,

1777
01:55:51,990 --> 01:55:56,990
really some of the best illustrations
I've ever seen from using this one to one

1778
01:55:57,151 --> 01:56:00,300
project service with a handful of
different designers and illustrators.

1779
01:56:00,330 --> 01:56:04,260
It blew my mind. 99 designs makes
this all very easy and efficient.

1780
01:56:04,261 --> 01:56:09,000
So you can check out the Tao of Seneca
design and other work that I and your

1781
01:56:09,001 --> 01:56:10,290
fellow listeners for that matter.

1782
01:56:10,530 --> 01:56:15,120
I've done on 99
designs@ninetyninedesigns.com
forward slash Tim.

1783
01:56:15,360 --> 01:56:18,330
Again, that's [inaudible] 99
designs.com forward slash.

1784
01:56:18,510 --> 01:56:21,270
Tim this episode is brought
to you by wealth front.

1785
01:56:21,350 --> 01:56:23,790
Wealth Front is the future
of financial advice.

1786
01:56:23,791 --> 01:56:28,200
They become incredibly popular among my
friends in silicon valley and across the

1787
01:56:28,201 --> 01:56:32,340
country because they provide the same
high end financial advice that the best

1788
01:56:32,341 --> 01:56:34,650
private wealth managers deliver
it to the ultra wealthy,

1789
01:56:34,860 --> 01:56:39,000
but for any account size and at a
fraction of the cost. For instance,

1790
01:56:39,001 --> 01:56:42,450
they monitor your portfolio every day
across more than it does an asset class

1791
01:56:42,451 --> 01:56:47,010
classes to look for opportunities to
rebalance or harvest tax losses. Now,

1792
01:56:47,700 --> 01:56:51,480
would you do the same? Are you
doing the same? Probably not,

1793
01:56:51,810 --> 01:56:53,100
and the power's in the software.

1794
01:56:53,560 --> 01:56:56,460
Wealth Front now manages more
than $4 billion in assets,

1795
01:56:56,461 --> 01:56:58,980
which is up from around 2.5 billion.

1796
01:56:58,981 --> 01:57:00,690
When they started
advertising on this podcast,

1797
01:57:00,870 --> 01:57:05,160
they're growing incredibly quickly. Unlike
old fashioned private wealth managers.

1798
01:57:05,161 --> 01:57:07,500
Wealth front is powered
by innovative technology,

1799
01:57:07,770 --> 01:57:12,210
making it the most tax efficient,
low cost, hassle free way to invest.

1800
01:57:12,930 --> 01:57:13,740
They don't upload it.

1801
01:57:13,740 --> 01:57:18,150
Sales teams or retail locations so they
can deliver all of this sophisticated

1802
01:57:18,151 --> 01:57:22,050
financial advice and these services at
a fraction of the cost of a traditional

1803
01:57:22,051 --> 01:57:24,090
financial advisor.
So at the very least,

1804
01:57:24,120 --> 01:57:28,770
go to wealthfront.com forward slash Tim
and take it they're free risk assessment

1805
01:57:28,771 --> 01:57:31,460
survey. It only takes a couple
of minutes and Wealthfront.

1806
01:57:31,480 --> 01:57:34,470
We'll recommend a personalized portfolio
of investments. In other words,

1807
01:57:34,471 --> 01:57:36,780
they'll tell you exactly where
they would put your money.

1808
01:57:37,050 --> 01:57:39,930
So even if you don't use their service,
you have a huge leg up.

1809
01:57:40,290 --> 01:57:42,480
And do you have additional
information for making good decisions?

1810
01:57:43,140 --> 01:57:47,160
They use investment theory to automate
good financial behavior and decisions

1811
01:57:47,161 --> 01:57:49,590
that people typically don't make,
but should.
