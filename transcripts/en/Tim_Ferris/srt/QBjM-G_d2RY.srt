I can run flat out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking. Question,

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,650
I'm a cybernetic organism.

for instance.

20
00:01:10,231 --> 00:01:12,710
That's actually one of the places
I started with legal zooms,

21
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,110
looking at wills and so on,
related to estate planning. Legal.

30
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:54,980
This episode is brought to
you by wordpress.com I go
to platform for blogging

31
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:56,420
and creating websites.

32
00:01:56,690 --> 00:02:01,610
wordpress.com which I've used for ages
now is the online home for this podcast,

33
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:06,440
tim.blog/podcast, my blog and
all of my standalone book sites.

34
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:10,130
So whether you're looking to create a
personal blog, a business site, or both,

35
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,150
creating your website on wordpress.com
helps others to find you,

36
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:16,550
remember you and connect with you.

37
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,540
Wordpress is designed for nontechnical
businesses and bloggers. That's me.

38
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,090
I am not getting nitty gritty in the code.

39
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:26,180
You do not need experience
setting up a website.

40
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:29,480
They take care of the technical side
so it's easy to get your site up and

41
00:02:29,481 --> 00:02:30,170
running.

42
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:34,670
Their customer support team is available
to help 24 hours a day and not just

43
00:02:34,671 --> 00:02:38,870
Monday through Friday, but also weekends
and if you look at the bigger picture,

44
00:02:38,871 --> 00:02:42,320
28% of all websites run on wordpress,

45
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:46,550
which is mind blowing when you consider
it in plans. Start at just $4 per month.

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Listeners of this podcast can receive

50
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,720
Hello boys and girls.

51
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:11,110
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to
another episode of the Tim Ferriss show.

52
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:16,450
This episode is going to be a bit of an
anomaly and experiment and instead of my

53
00:03:16,451 --> 00:03:21,100
usual long form interviews
where I deconstruct world
class performers to tease

54
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:24,760
out the habits, routines,
favorite books and so on.

55
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:30,150
I will share some details from my own
life and decision making and so on,

56
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:35,730
based on questions that have been up voted
by subscribers to five bullet Friday.

57
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:38,200
What is five bullet?
Friday?

58
00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:43,201
Five bullet Friday is a free newsletter
that I send out every Friday that

59
00:03:43,391 --> 00:03:47,950
includes the five coolest things I've
found or explored that week can include

60
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:52,570
what I'm reading, books, articles,
gadgets, uh, tech work arounds,

61
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:56,420
any type of experiments that I'm doing,
favorite purchases, et Cetera, et Cetera,

62
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:00,670
et cetera. And this newsletter has
proven to be very, very popular.

63
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:06,270
More than a million people subscribe has
more than a 60% open rate for those of

64
00:04:06,491 --> 00:04:11,400
you in the email world, you know,
that is absolutely astonishing. Uh,

65
00:04:11,401 --> 00:04:13,720
so people do look forward to this.
It's free.

66
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:15,460
It will always be phrased
if you want to check it out.

67
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:20,320
And they're also exclusive
meetups, opportunities to
ask me questions and so on.

68
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,240
Check it out at Tim Dot.

69
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:27,241
Blog forward slash Friday tim.blog
forward slash Friday and it's super short.

70
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:31,990
Five bullet point email with
lots of fun stuff every Friday,

71
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,080
something to help you get a little
morsel to chew on for your weekend,

72
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,410
so let's just jump right into
question number one. Hi Tim.

73
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:45,310
What are the top five health markers
to check and watch regularly?

74
00:04:45,311 --> 00:04:49,810
This is a very tough question to
answer because so much of it would be

75
00:04:49,811 --> 00:04:53,620
predicated on your personal situation,
biochemistry,

76
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:58,150
family history and so on. I'm not
going to totally dodge, but I will say,

77
00:04:58,151 --> 00:04:59,500
and I'm paraphrasing here,

78
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:04,270
the words of much wiser doctors
that I work with. However,

79
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,310
above the age of 40 or so,

80
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:11,340
I want to say with a 70% or
greater likelihood you are
going to be killed or you

81
00:05:12,681 --> 00:05:15,730
are going to die from one of
four things. Cancer, stroke,

82
00:05:15,731 --> 00:05:20,230
heart attack or neurodegenerative
disease or complications thereof.

83
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,210
Looking at family history,

84
00:05:22,211 --> 00:05:26,590
you can pretty quickly figure out which
are the primary candidates. In my case,

85
00:05:26,591 --> 00:05:31,591
it's hard attack and neurodegenerative
disease like Alzheimer's and someone.

86
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,200
Therefore,
many of the things I do,

87
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:40,620
both track end preemptively
or preventatively treat
are going to be related to

88
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:45,820
heart attack, cardiovascular disease
or neurodegenerative disease.

89
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:50,230
All right, so that would dictate
say the use of Curcumin, like uh,

90
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:53,860
I think it's called a thera cumin,
something like that for instance,

91
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:56,920
or on the heart attack side
looking at other things.

92
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:02,320
But I want to refer everyone
to tim.blog forward slash A.

93
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,550
Tia, a t T. I a.

94
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:08,750
This will take you to episodes featuring
Dr Peter Attia who is one of the best

95
00:06:08,751 --> 00:06:12,590
mds I know and I know a lot of mds.
He works with many,

96
00:06:12,591 --> 00:06:17,540
many name brand folks as a concierge
doctor you would recognize has very

97
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:21,920
credible, uh, background. He is
exceptionally evidence-based,

98
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:27,340
also former ultra endurance athletes
swimming 25 plus mile swimming races and

99
00:06:28,701 --> 00:06:29,331
things of that type.

100
00:06:29,331 --> 00:06:34,331
So he understands and appreciates the
implications and also trade offs of say,

101
00:06:35,331 --> 00:06:39,230
longevity versus performance,
which are very often at odds.

102
00:06:39,231 --> 00:06:42,410
Does that mean you want 100% of one
and none of the other probably not.

103
00:06:42,411 --> 00:06:47,030
So how do you navigate that
blend in any case specifically,

104
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:47,661
if you go to Tim dot.

105
00:06:47,661 --> 00:06:52,661
Blog forward slash Tiaa look at episode
65 because he answers this question in

106
00:06:55,491 --> 00:06:59,000
great detail and I may be
getting some of this wrong,

107
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:02,750
but I'm looking at the show notes and
here's what I see listed under medical

108
00:07:02,751 --> 00:07:07,190
terminology, a apo e genotype. All right,

109
00:07:07,191 --> 00:07:11,540
this can be indicative of your
predisposition to things like Alzheimer's,

110
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,130
Ldl particle number.
Alright,

111
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,900
particle number is a critical
piece of this Lp. Little a.

112
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:23,510
The next we have OGT that stands
for oral glucose tolerance test.

113
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:28,640
Then you have IGF one insulin
like growth factor one,

114
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,950
uh, does mohs drawl and few
other things are listed here. Uh,

115
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:37,940
and uh, very frequently if
you're talking with say Peter,

116
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:43,110
at least the way that he and I often do
things using either intermittent fasting

117
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:46,730
or extended periods of fasting,
say three contiguous days per month,

118
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:50,270
and then longer periods a few
times per year as a purge fast.

119
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:55,390
As discussed in my episode with Dr Dominic
D'agostino who was introduced to me

120
00:07:55,581 --> 00:08:00,080
by Peter. Uh, this can be used as a, uh,

121
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:04,340
a plausible preventative
measure to counter cancer,

122
00:08:04,341 --> 00:08:08,480
which is not one of my most likely
candidates to kill me personally,

123
00:08:08,481 --> 00:08:10,340
although it certainly
is for a lot of folks.

124
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,930
And going between phases of say,
hypertrophy,

125
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:19,070
meaning muscle building and
performance optimization, uh,

126
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:22,560
alternating that with
periods of Autophagy, uh,

127
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:27,290
which you can help trigger this type of
cellular self cleaning through things

128
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:31,760
like fasting among others. Uh, exercise
certainly plays a role. All right,

129
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:37,150
so long story short, I defer to Peter.
Tia, go to Tim dot. Blog forts hush. Tia,

130
00:08:37,151 --> 00:08:40,070
check out episode 65 specifically.

131
00:08:40,071 --> 00:08:44,690
And this question is answered as his
first question from y'all. All right,

132
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:50,620
next I'm going to answer how do
you manage all of your contacts,

133
00:08:51,561 --> 00:08:53,990
you know, so many people and
how they are all interrelated.

134
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:56,730
Do you have a specific system
or software to help you?

135
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:00,880
And I'm going to answer this with
a non answer, which is no, uh,

136
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,990
because I don't want to make it
seem like I have all the answers.

137
00:09:03,991 --> 00:09:08,250
And that I'm selectively picking those I
have great answers to which will create

138
00:09:08,251 --> 00:09:12,120
that illusion. So no, I do not have
software for this. I wish I did,

139
00:09:12,121 --> 00:09:16,560
but simultaneously I am
nervous.

140
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:21,590
I suppose creeped out would be another
way to put it by the amount of data,

141
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,430
Google,
Facebook and so on.

142
00:09:23,431 --> 00:09:28,320
Have Apple included and what they're
able to correlate without any input from

143
00:09:28,321 --> 00:09:29,250
me.
For instance,

144
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:34,280
auto correcting names I've been texting
with or that I have off of what I

145
00:09:34,681 --> 00:09:37,800
perceive to be the apple
platform and my phone. Uh,

146
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:42,600
or for instance a Facebook in some way,

147
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,790
a correlating based on
the app use on the phone.

148
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,140
People I've just added to contacts or
been texting with or names I've mentioned

149
00:09:52,141 --> 00:09:54,900
with their suggested people
you should know on Facebook.

150
00:09:54,901 --> 00:09:59,040
All of these things creep me out.
So I don't think I put in enough data,

151
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,061
uh,

152
00:10:00,061 --> 00:10:05,061
or detail into my contacts to make
this a easily solvable by software.

153
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,710
Because even if you were to pull by
area code, say I'm traveling to Texas,

154
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:14,700
so I want to know who has a five one,

155
00:10:14,701 --> 00:10:15,810
two area code,

156
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,100
let's just say so that I can ask certain
people out to lunch or dinner. Well,

157
00:10:20,101 --> 00:10:25,101
people's physical addresses change
more often then their phone numbers.

158
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:30,000
Uh, so that is not an accurate
indicator. So the short answer is no.

159
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,870
What I try to do with my contacts,
because rightly,

160
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:37,080
I mean you have a,

161
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:41,310
I suppose inferred by the question that
I know thousands and meet thousands of

162
00:10:41,311 --> 00:10:43,320
new people every single year.

163
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:48,890
I try to simply know one or two people
who are very strong in each given field

164
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:55,290
and through those people I can get to
anyone I might need. In other words,

165
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:00,740
I'm focusing on just in time
introductions and contacts,

166
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,300
not just in case contacts.

167
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:08,310
And this is a corollary to something that
Kathy Sierra taught me long time ago,

168
00:11:08,311 --> 00:11:12,900
which was to focus on just in
time information. In other words,

169
00:11:12,901 --> 00:11:16,530
and knowing how to find the information
you need when you need it as opposed to

170
00:11:16,531 --> 00:11:18,090
just in case information.

171
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:22,020
Good example of that would
be reading business books.

172
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:25,440
Say on how to sell your company when
you're running a startup in the early

173
00:11:25,441 --> 00:11:29,610
stages because you are going
to take notes properly,

174
00:11:29,611 --> 00:11:33,840
forget everything and then have to reread
that book at a later point in time if

175
00:11:33,841 --> 00:11:37,110
you ever pick it up again.
And that is a sunk cost.

176
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:41,790
So just in time information instead of
just in case information and just in time

177
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:42,624
contacts,

178
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:47,870
Visa v one or two highly competent
people in each field versus collecting

179
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,040
hundreds and thousands of business
cards and figuring out what to do with,

180
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:56,770
which is a more reactive way
to go about it. Next question,

181
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:02,430
have you or your guests any strategies
to prevent or minimize binge eating

182
00:12:02,501 --> 00:12:05,290
during periods of stress?
Yes,

183
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,660
and the last two weeks have
been very stressful for me.

184
00:12:07,661 --> 00:12:12,661
I've had many crises pop up at the same
time and it has been very challenging

185
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:20,070
and I will tell you that the first rule
is to eliminate from the home anything

186
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,090
that you would binge eat.

187
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:30,510
And this really underscores my belief
that your systems Trump willpower,

188
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:36,760
you should rely on proper
systems and restrictions,

189
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,110
environmentally speaking versus this
thing that we like to think of as

190
00:12:41,111 --> 00:12:45,970
discipline or willpower, which is
very fallible. And case in point,

191
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:46,840
uh,

192
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:51,490
I have come home from late dinners or say
two glasses of wine during this period

193
00:12:51,491 --> 00:12:54,430
of high stress, landed
home, gone into the Pantry,

194
00:12:54,431 --> 00:12:59,200
deliberately looking for things
to snack on, any bit of chocolate,

195
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,180
any bag of potato chips,

196
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:05,080
anything that might remotely
qualify as a chief food.

197
00:13:05,081 --> 00:13:09,280
And instead I find mustard MCT oil,
athletic greens,

198
00:13:09,281 --> 00:13:11,170
protein powder,
canned beans,

199
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,490
not interesting whatsoever
as late night cheat foods.

200
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:20,230
And therefore I don't end up bingeing
when I violate that. For instance,

201
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:21,940
about six days ago,

202
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:27,120
I was visiting a consumer packaged good
company and they gave me three amazing

203
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:30,850
bags of,
I'll say potato chips,

204
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:35,380
but they're really tortilla chips made
from different types of root vegetables

205
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:39,970
and so on. Delicious. And came
back one night and what did I do?

206
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:45,150
I had these three bags that are never
in my pantry and I promptly eight all

207
00:13:45,431 --> 00:13:50,080
three bags,
2100 calories of these tortilla chips,

208
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,770
and they were delicious. Did I regret
that? Yes. Did I feel guilty? Yes.

209
00:13:53,771 --> 00:13:56,980
Did I think less of myself for having done
it? Yes. So keep it out of your house.

210
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:01,150
If you have anything that is chief food
in your house, removed from your house,

211
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,430
that is system overwhelmed.
Power number one.

212
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:08,830
Number two is get your breakfast right.
So if you consume,

213
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:12,490
for instance,
what I would consider perhaps a,

214
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,530
an ideal breakfast for many people,

215
00:14:14,531 --> 00:14:17,620
30 grams of protein within 30 minutes
of waking up, which means you wake up,

216
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:22,030
you have breakfast,
and that could be say three eggs,

217
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:25,270
three whole eggs is what Gretchen
Ruben does as well. By the way,

218
00:14:25,271 --> 00:14:30,250
for those of you who heard her on
the podcast sometime ago, three eggs,

219
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,970
some spinach could be microwave.
It doesn't make a difference to me,

220
00:14:33,971 --> 00:14:35,480
but let's just say a
little bit of spinach.

221
00:14:35,481 --> 00:14:40,270
So you have that fiber and then you
also have some type of black beans or

222
00:14:40,271 --> 00:14:44,320
lentils or pinto beans.
Some type of beans and save three eggs,

223
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:47,800
uh, lentils or beans,
and then some spinach,

224
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:51,920
the composition of that meal,
the Macros, so to speak,

225
00:14:51,921 --> 00:14:56,921
the protein load plus the fiber content
will help to stave off any type of a

226
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,190
binge inclination for the rest of the day.
And there's a very,

227
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:08,300
very good chance if you just fix
that meal. If you just dial in,

228
00:15:08,301 --> 00:15:10,520
that is your new default
breakfast that you will consume,

229
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:15,790
say 15 to 30% fewer calories
for the rest of the day.

230
00:15:16,491 --> 00:15:17,181
This is very,

231
00:15:17,181 --> 00:15:21,950
very common and is also why
if you have a hundred pounds,

232
00:15:21,951 --> 00:15:23,900
150 pounds,
200 pounds to lose,

233
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:27,710
and many people have done this on the
slow carb diet and you can search how to

234
00:15:27,711 --> 00:15:32,360
lose a hundred pounds slow carb diet for
free case studies and instructions on

235
00:15:32,361 --> 00:15:35,480
how to do this with photographs.
Uh,

236
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:41,890
I will first ask that they do nothing
other than change their breakfast.

237
00:15:42,831 --> 00:15:47,831
Why is a lead domino that then has many
downstream effects that you could treat

238
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:53,630
as independent decisions otherwise,
but that would lead to decision fatigue.

239
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:58,910
So why not look at all these decisions
and ask yourself which of these if made

240
00:15:58,911 --> 00:16:03,530
or done correctly would make the
others automatic irrelevant or easier.

241
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,640
And the answer is fixing breakfast
and there are other guidelines,

242
00:16:07,641 --> 00:16:11,570
but really those are two of the
primaries. All right, next question.

243
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:15,500
What's next for you now that
your book is launched? Uh,

244
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:20,930
the book that is referred to in
this question is tribe of mentors.

245
00:16:20,931 --> 00:16:25,760
We'll try for mentors and thanks to
all of you. Thank you very, very much.

246
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:26,990
Ended up number one,

247
00:16:26,991 --> 00:16:31,991
New York Times Number One Wall
Street Journal and it is in orbit.

248
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:37,220
So it is reached escape velocity and
it is always my job just to get the

249
00:16:37,221 --> 00:16:40,880
flywheel spinning. And if the book is any
good, it sticks. If not, then it doesn't.

250
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:45,910
But this one appears to have stuck and
at this point I view my job as saying no

251
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:53,300
to a thousand things and
creating space to listen.

252
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:59,030
This is along the lines of what Tim
O'reilly has shared on this podcast and if

253
00:16:59,031 --> 00:17:01,370
you haven't heard that episode of
highly recommend you check it out.

254
00:17:01,371 --> 00:17:05,390
If you're asking yourself, Tim, who
all the more reason to go check it out,

255
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:07,400
but creating space to listen,

256
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:12,430
to really just exist and develop
a higher level of perception.

257
00:17:12,891 --> 00:17:17,510
So I am focused on all manner
of things to assist that, uh,

258
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:22,570
such as testing a Beta version of the
waking up APP by my friend Sam Harris,

259
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:26,000
who's also been on this pod before,

260
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:31,660
who manages to somehow speak in fully
formed pros paragraphs or blocking out

261
00:17:32,781 --> 00:17:35,210
time. Whether that is, for instance,

262
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,230
this weekend when I will be going to an
airbnb way out in the country here in

263
00:17:39,231 --> 00:17:41,090
Texas with no Wifi,

264
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:46,570
no reception whatsoever or
say more extended trips of
two to three weeks with my

265
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:52,650
family, which I do twice a year
after reading the tail end,

266
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:55,380
an essay by Tim urban on wait,
but why?

267
00:17:55,380 --> 00:18:00,210
Which put the remaining number of hours
as a percentage of the total that I'll

268
00:18:00,211 --> 00:18:01,980
spend with my family before they die,

269
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:06,981
my parents specifically into perspective
or a blocking out an entire month to

270
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
hopefully go off the grid without
using any social media or electronics,

271
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:17,550
which I'm in the process of planning now.
Why would I want to do this?

272
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:20,160
I mentioned this in brief earlier,

273
00:18:20,161 --> 00:18:25,161
but developing a higher sensitivity and
ability to perceive this can be helpful.

274
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:32,810
Whether you are doing some explicit type
of work such as cal Newport's deep work

275
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
say which requires extended
periods of uninterrupted time,

276
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,083
blocks of time,

277
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:44,120
or if you are simply trying to be more
aware and develop an awareness of how you

278
00:18:47,191 --> 00:18:48,510
feel,
how you think,

279
00:18:48,511 --> 00:18:53,190
how you react in perhaps a
vipassana meditation respect,

280
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:53,971
uh,

281
00:18:53,971 --> 00:18:58,971
so that your ability to parse
life and be less reactive is uh,

282
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,100
developed over time,

283
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:05,520
which is something certainly I'm
paying a lot of attention to right now.

284
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,890
Especially given the number of crises
that have hit in the last a week or two,

285
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:16,370
which has proven to me the value of
this type of training and deliberately

286
00:19:16,921 --> 00:19:19,110
creating space to listen.
Allah,

287
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:23,850
Tim O'reilly and that is o Apostrophe,
r.

288
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:27,750
E. I. L. L. Y. For those of you who
wants to check it out. All right.

289
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:31,830
Next question is about EDC.

290
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:36,630
Every day carry, what do you keep
on your person as part of your EDC?

291
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:41,250
How do you carry it? How does it change
during travel or other activities slash?

292
00:19:41,251 --> 00:19:43,800
Events? Bonus points if you
do a pocket dumb. All right.

293
00:19:43,801 --> 00:19:48,750
Short answer is I have a very
unimpressive EDC when you consider my pant

294
00:19:48,751 --> 00:19:51,720
pockets. I don't like keeping things
in my pant pocket so I don't have much.

295
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:57,230
I do use a Patagonia lightweight
fleece vest oftentimes as my walking,

296
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,360
uh,
portable bag that I wear on myself.

297
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,810
But the backpack is,

298
00:20:05,811 --> 00:20:10,230
is really the standard form and it travels
with the almost everywhere that I go.

299
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:15,120
And I have a number of different pack
backs including one made by dots with Sada

300
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,910
da t s u s a r a made out of hemp,

301
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:22,940
which was or is I should say a company
created by a reader after going through

302
00:20:24,901 --> 00:20:27,230
the four hour work week, which is fun. Uh,

303
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:31,810
and in that backpack there are
a number of things that, uh,

304
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:36,030
I travel with at all times,
including the rubs ball.

305
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:39,900
Are you busy ball? Looks like a golf
ball with a little prongs on it.

306
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:43,320
And that was introduced
to me by Amelia Boone,

307
00:20:43,321 --> 00:20:48,321
four time world champion in obstacle
course racing for you say before flights,

308
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:51,850
after flights, uh, during
any period of travel.

309
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:53,830
And it alleviates tightness and pain,

310
00:20:53,831 --> 00:20:58,450
not just in the feet but all the way up
through the legs, the posterior chain,

311
00:20:58,451 --> 00:21:03,040
the hips, it unlocks more than you would
expect. So that always travels with me.

312
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:07,300
A headlamp. I always have a headlamp
in a side pocket very often.

313
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:12,330
Black diamond sprayable
zinc for bolstering the
immune system and Melatonin,

314
00:21:13,271 --> 00:21:16,480
typically three milligram tablets.
Uh,

315
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:21,570
and everyone from art Devani to Dominic
D'agostino are fans of Melatonin and use

316
00:21:23,591 --> 00:21:26,260
of different points.
Voodoo floss for self care,

317
00:21:26,261 --> 00:21:30,520
different types of joint issues
created by Kelly Starr at,

318
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:34,300
you can Google that for more
of a journal of some type.

319
00:21:34,301 --> 00:21:37,240
Very frequently the five minute
journal or morning pages,

320
00:21:37,241 --> 00:21:41,440
but the morning pages paperback
is exceptionally heavy.

321
00:21:41,441 --> 00:21:45,160
So I often ditch that
earplugs most frequently.

322
00:21:45,161 --> 00:21:48,610
Max Silicone Potty earplugs.
So you can sleep on,

323
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:53,290
say your side without having
foam poke into your inner ear.

324
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:58,620
And then and I'm ask of some type and
the sleep master ims is one I use very

325
00:21:58,811 --> 00:21:59,590
frequently.

326
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:04,510
It also covers the ears and the outside
as opposed to digging in with an elastic

327
00:22:04,511 --> 00:22:05,344
strap.

328
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:10,530
The only caveat is that it can be very
warm so I also collect eye masks from

329
00:22:10,751 --> 00:22:15,460
various flights and so on. If you were
to look at what I carried some time ago,

330
00:22:15,461 --> 00:22:18,460
for instance when I was reading the four
hour chef and got really into prepper

331
00:22:18,461 --> 00:22:22,840
Ville and all of that, I would
have had a multi tool in my wallet.

332
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:26,910
It would look like a metal business
card with little nooks and crannies for

333
00:22:26,911 --> 00:22:30,850
Phillip's head screwdriver,
say saw edge et cetera.

334
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:35,490
That was recently confiscated by
the Tsa. Surprise, surprise. Uh,

335
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:39,520
I would also have potentially a sure fire,

336
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,200
a flashlight,

337
00:22:41,201 --> 00:22:46,201
tactical flashlight in my bag and
then I would have a para cord,

338
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:49,330
wrist band or bracelet of some type.

339
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:52,090
If you're wondering what
you could use para cord for,

340
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:55,660
the answer is almost
anything including bow drill,

341
00:22:55,900 --> 00:23:00,400
which is a bit of an edge case
for all practical purposes,

342
00:23:00,401 --> 00:23:01,840
but you can look up bow drill.

343
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,740
If you want to see how to make fire using
something like para cord that is woven

344
00:23:05,741 --> 00:23:06,574
into a bracelet.

345
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:11,700
And you could also look up Tim Ferriss
experiment Los Vegas escape to see some

346
00:23:15,641 --> 00:23:20,170
of the training I did with
onpoint tactical and Kevin
Reeve where we looked at

347
00:23:20,171 --> 00:23:21,370
getting out of zip ties,

348
00:23:21,371 --> 00:23:23,620
getting out of handcuffs and
all sorts of other craziness.

349
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:26,410
So you can check that out at your leisure.

350
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:30,160
But these days I don't have
a whole hell of a lot, uh,

351
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:34,060
in terms of EDC,
suppose now that I live in Texas,

352
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:38,950
I could go get my concealed carry and
that would add a whole new layer to

353
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:43,690
paranoia, danger and a potential
offense. So there you have it.

354
00:23:43,691 --> 00:23:45,980
Such defense, right? Next up,

355
00:23:45,981 --> 00:23:50,120
we have most valuable skills for financial
freedom and being better with money.

356
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:53,450
Question Mark.
This is a super dicey question.

357
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,650
So I'm going to add a
very important preamble,

358
00:23:57,651 --> 00:24:02,110
which is I am not a
professional investment advisor,

359
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:07,000
nor do I play one on the Internet. So this
is for informational purposes only. Uh,

360
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,950
a lot of people take
everything I say literally,

361
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:13,430
and that is dangerous.
So don't do that.

362
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:18,050
Use Your own brain and much like the
question of what are the top five health

363
00:24:18,051 --> 00:24:19,670
markers to check and watch regularly.

364
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:25,310
Most valuable skills for financial freedom
and being better with money is highly

365
00:24:25,311 --> 00:24:29,930
personalized. But what I would
say is that if you are in debt,

366
00:24:29,931 --> 00:24:33,080
if you have a substantial amount of debt,
uh,

367
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:35,290
I have found for instance,
or I've,

368
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:40,330
I've certainly heard from hundreds of
listeners and readers that Dave Ramsey is

369
00:24:42,411 --> 00:24:47,300
very helpful. Uh, some people
are very big fans of Rich Dad,

370
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,860
poor dad by Kiyosaki and the quadrants.
Pr In particular in that book,

371
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:57,260
uh, is something that many have
found useful. Uh, Rameet Seti,

372
00:24:57,290 --> 00:25:00,290
good friend of mine, a r a, M. I t. S.

373
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:05,320
E t h I is a very adept and I think
very smart in this particular arena.

374
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:12,370
And if you want to look up
automated finance system,

375
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:16,800
Rameet Ra, MIT and then Tim Ferris, uh,

376
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:21,740
he has a guest blog post on my blog.
A that is very,

377
00:25:21,741 --> 00:25:25,580
very popular, has been very popular over
the years and is worth taking a look at.

378
00:25:25,581 --> 00:25:28,970
So I,
I do think that if you are in debt,

379
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,290
those three places are
good places to start.

380
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:38,450
Beyond that, I can really only
speak from personal experience,

381
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:43,780
but financial freedom can entail a lot
and can mean many things to different

382
00:25:44,481 --> 00:25:47,660
people.
That could mean lack of debt.

383
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,470
It could mean being able to do whatever
you want, in which case, uh, the,

384
00:25:52,471 --> 00:25:53,540
the sky's the limit.

385
00:25:53,541 --> 00:25:56,690
Perhaps you need tens of millions
or hundreds of millions of dollars.

386
00:25:56,691 --> 00:25:58,040
If you want to buy that jet,

387
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:03,400
it could mean financial freedom that
you are free from financial worry.

388
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:08,920
It no longer occupies 20% of your ram at
all times and being better with money.

389
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:10,363
All right?

390
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:15,730
I would divide being better with
money into two different categories.

391
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:18,560
And keeping in mind that for me,

392
00:26:18,561 --> 00:26:22,670
a good investment is one that
increases your quality of life.

393
00:26:22,671 --> 00:26:24,530
Why otherwise would you invest?

394
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:30,100
So if you say are invested in crypto
and the percentage gains are very

395
00:26:31,821 --> 00:26:32,391
attractive,

396
00:26:32,391 --> 00:26:37,391
but you're a complete crackhead
compulsively checking the charts every 15

397
00:26:38,181 --> 00:26:40,280
minutes,
is that a good investment?

398
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,560
Well that's a question
for you to sit with,

399
00:26:43,561 --> 00:26:48,561
but if it progressively worsens your
quality of life or consistently creates

400
00:26:50,551 --> 00:26:52,530
more anxiety than you had beforehand,

401
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:57,600
is the marginal utility of the dollars
you are gaining as reflected in that

402
00:26:57,601 --> 00:27:02,601
percentage enough to offset that with
some type of lump sum payment of happiness

403
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:05,580
or improved quality of life at the end?
Maybe not,

404
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,720
but this is something worth considering
coming back to what I was saying though,

405
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:14,430
I tend to think of
money as a getting rich,

406
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,300
staying rich.

407
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:20,390
So there are different tools in the
toolkit for getting rich different tools

408
00:27:20,401 --> 00:27:25,100
then in the staying rich category.
And uh,

409
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:30,090
I would say if you're looking
at beating the market, so Alpha,

410
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:35,240
I th I don't do that in a
hands off styles of investing.

411
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:40,710
Uh, I, I have that very much
on one side of my barbell.

412
00:27:40,711 --> 00:27:42,640
So I personally,
uh,

413
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:47,960
partially by choice and partially
by fate have ended up with a very,

414
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:52,890
a barbell looking asset distribution.

415
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,590
And if you were to look at what I have,

416
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:59,280
you're going to have highly volatile
what most people would consider highly

417
00:27:59,281 --> 00:28:02,730
risky class of investments,

418
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:05,400
namely startups and cryptocurrency.

419
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:10,850
That's going to be more
than 50% of my total assets.

420
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:11,850
Uh,

421
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:16,650
and then you have real estate and cash
or cash equivalence and that's pretty

422
00:28:16,651 --> 00:28:18,600
much it.
So on opposite ends of the spectrum,

423
00:28:18,601 --> 00:28:22,590
and we could debate whether
or not real estate is risky,

424
00:28:22,591 --> 00:28:27,591
we could debate the benefits of cash if
you also have to contend with inflation.

425
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:28,471
Well,

426
00:28:28,471 --> 00:28:32,280
let's just keep it simple for the sake
of this discussion and say that you have

427
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:36,750
a highly volatile,
what most people would consider high risk,

428
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:41,220
high reward categories like privately
held startups and cryptocurrency on one

429
00:28:41,221 --> 00:28:45,180
end of the Barbell,
which is where I create my alpha.

430
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:47,880
And then you have real estate cash,

431
00:28:47,881 --> 00:28:51,960
cash like equivalents and
things like for instance,

432
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:56,990
a Muni bonds and so on where you
would then preserve that alpha.

433
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:00,960
Okay, so you create Alpha, take it
off the table and then preserve Alpha.

434
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:05,460
Now forget about the question
of converting crypto into
Fiat or keeping it in

435
00:29:05,461 --> 00:29:07,450
crypto. Let's just keep it simple. Uh,

436
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:12,740
so that is currently what my
asset allocation would look like.

437
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,870
That is very,

438
00:29:15,871 --> 00:29:20,790
very likely to change over time and I
should address a couple of questions that

439
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:21,720
likely come to mind.

440
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:26,750
One would be why on earth do you have
more than 50% of your net worth and

441
00:29:26,851 --> 00:29:31,851
startups and crypto and it is not because
I had a hundred units of assets and

442
00:29:34,201 --> 00:29:39,201
decided to put 50 plus percent of
those units into crypto and startups.

443
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:42,850
That would be complete insanity.
I think for almost anyone.

444
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:47,860
It's because I started off with
a very reasonable allocation.

445
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:52,210
Some of you might remember that
many years ago, 2008 or so,

446
00:29:52,211 --> 00:29:57,211
I created for myself a real world MBA
rather than going to a Stanford GSB or one

447
00:29:57,641 --> 00:29:59,470
of these graduate school
programs and business,

448
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:03,760
I decided to take the same amount of
money over two years. At that point,

449
00:30:03,761 --> 00:30:05,680
it was $60,000 a year for two years.

450
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:11,130
And invest that into the Tim Ferriss
Fund in quotation marks to try my hand at

451
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:15,220
startup investing in the very beginning,

452
00:30:15,221 --> 00:30:18,190
piggybacking and co-investing with
people who knew what they were doing.

453
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:22,600
And I assumed the network
built the skills, developed,

454
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:27,630
the knowledge acquired over that two
year period of time would benefit me more

455
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:33,340
than the $120,000,
which I assumed I would lose.

456
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,700
Or the assumption was much like
tuition that would be a sunk cost.

457
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:42,210
And that then set me on this accidental
career of being an early stage tech

458
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,370
angel investor and advisor.

459
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:50,700
And that tiny sliver of my
total pie chart at that time,

460
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:56,130
due to a lucky slash good investments
and companies selection has swollen to a

461
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:04,300
gigantic percentage of the total pie
chart with companies like Uber, Facebook,

462
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:09,340
Twitter, Alibaba, and so on. Uh,
crypto very similarly, uh, has,

463
00:31:09,341 --> 00:31:11,110
has not,
uh,

464
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:16,140
necessarily risen as it would have had
I gone in early with something like a

465
00:31:16,411 --> 00:31:17,860
theory, them, uh,

466
00:31:17,861 --> 00:31:22,360
but has nonetheless doubled and so
on over time, more than doubled.

467
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:26,860
So compete, if you look at my cost
basis, it was a very rational,

468
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:31,390
well semi rational decision at the t at
the time to allocate what I allocated.

469
00:31:31,391 --> 00:31:34,660
But due to growth, uh,
they now represent a very,

470
00:31:34,661 --> 00:31:39,490
very large percentage of my total holdings
and the crypto can be freely traded,

471
00:31:39,491 --> 00:31:41,860
the startups are locked up.
All right?

472
00:31:41,861 --> 00:31:46,861
So I am unable to decrease my
positions and balance those,

473
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:52,210
uh, for the most part. And that is why
my portfolio, it looks the way it does.

474
00:31:52,211 --> 00:31:54,500
I would not recommend my,
uh,

475
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:58,490
asset allocation to really anyone.
Um,

476
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,560
now this comes back to,
uh,

477
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:05,140
the question of financial freedom,
getting better with money.

478
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:09,610
If we're looking at the,
the getting rich part,

479
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:12,400
the building wealth for a
less crass way to put it,

480
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,560
a building wealth preserving off
sounds a lot fancier, much more, uh,

481
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:22,550
Rockefeller. Then nouveau riche. So
let's stick with that. All right.

482
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:27,490
Building wealth, preserving
wealth. The way that I have a,

483
00:32:27,491 --> 00:32:32,491
if we're assuming there's some aspect of
skill involved and that I'm not just a

484
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:36,160
lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky,
which could be the case, right?

485
00:32:36,161 --> 00:32:39,380
If you have a thousand orangutans
flip coins long enough,

486
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:41,750
as Warren Buffett would say, Oh,
actually, Warren buffet wouldn't say this.

487
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:45,200
The efficient market market
theorists folks would say this,

488
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,970
you have a thousand
monkeys flipping coins.

489
00:32:46,971 --> 00:32:49,410
Eventually you're going to find one
or two monkeys who flip, you know,

490
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:53,960
50 heads in a row and then end up writing
books about how to flip coins and so

491
00:32:53,961 --> 00:32:58,250
on. So maybe I'm that monkey. But, uh, if
we assume there's some element of skill,

492
00:32:58,251 --> 00:33:00,110
the way that I've thought
about it is number one,

493
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:05,680
a capping downside first versus evaluating
upside and looking at the minimal

494
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:10,380
downside. And this is borrowed
from a lot of folks, including, uh,

495
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:14,480
some famous names you might recognize.
Warren Buffett, for instance,

496
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:17,420
a WHO's a would be considered,

497
00:33:17,421 --> 00:33:21,560
I think by most a value investor or the
Charlie Munger has certainly informed

498
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:25,460
their, their leader investment styles. Uh,

499
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:28,970
Paul Tudor Jones of hedge fund fame.

500
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:34,320
And this is actually a quote that I
took from Tony Robbins book unshakeable,

501
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:41,060
uh, which is, which is very good or money
master the game also very, very good.

502
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:45,560
Is this truly the hard trade? And this
is from Paul Tudor Jones. Paraphrasing,

503
00:33:45,561 --> 00:33:47,300
is this truly the hard
trade question mark?

504
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:49,700
Meaning something others
can't easily replicate?

505
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:52,610
Does this really have
asymmetric risk reward?

506
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:57,530
Is it a five to one or three to one?
That means for every dollar he is risking,

507
00:33:57,531 --> 00:34:02,240
is there the potential or
expectation of a three or $5 Roi?

508
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:07,160
What's the entry point? What are your
stops? Right? These are all really,

509
00:34:07,161 --> 00:34:09,410
really good questions.

510
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:14,270
And the downside risk happening,
the downside risk is also something that,

511
00:34:14,271 --> 00:34:18,260
for instance, Richard Branson does and
when he started a Virgin Atlantic, uh,

512
00:34:18,261 --> 00:34:22,310
negotiating a lease with Boeing so that
he could return the plane or planes if

513
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:23,690
it didn't work out.

514
00:34:23,691 --> 00:34:27,800
So even these people who are
viewed as in veteran risk takers,

515
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:32,120
people to throw caution to the wind are
in fact determining how to limit their

516
00:34:32,121 --> 00:34:34,880
downside right up front and then
looking for asymmetric risks.

517
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:37,970
So in the startup world,
uh, that check the box,

518
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,510
you can put in 25 k Max,
you know,

519
00:34:41,511 --> 00:34:44,270
your maximum that you can lose because
you're not using leverage or anything

520
00:34:44,271 --> 00:34:46,370
else.
25 k is the maximum you can lose.

521
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:51,470
And yet there is the potential if you,
uh,

522
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:55,370
focus on an unfair advantage
and we'll come back to that,

523
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,710
that you could have a hundred,

524
00:34:57,711 --> 00:35:01,880
2000 x return and the startup world,

525
00:35:01,881 --> 00:35:04,880
much like a publishing book,

526
00:35:04,881 --> 00:35:08,820
publishing music and these are
hits driven businesses, uh,

527
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:13,830
a you are betting on companies or books
or musicians were albums that you hope

528
00:35:14,511 --> 00:35:15,770
will return the fund.

529
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:21,310
They will return all of the other losses
that you will incur a with your other

530
00:35:21,471 --> 00:35:26,450
bets. And uh, I do very well
with those types of decisions.

531
00:35:26,451 --> 00:35:29,030
They are binary,
they're not day trading.

532
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:34,060
They're certainly not a considering
buying or selling on a regular basis,

533
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,580
uh, at which point you become
very susceptible to mister market.

534
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:42,630
If you want to look up
Warren Buffet, Mr Market, uh,

535
00:35:42,631 --> 00:35:44,870
that is who I am in public markets.

536
00:35:44,871 --> 00:35:49,871
So I do not play much with public
ally traded equities for instance,

537
00:35:50,101 --> 00:35:52,950
even though that might be part
of my portfolio later. Uh,

538
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:55,830
instead I like to do a
ton of research upfront,

539
00:35:55,831 --> 00:35:59,940
make a Binary Decision Min,
min out, and then I'm stuck.

540
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:02,310
And that being stuck
is actually a benefit.

541
00:36:02,311 --> 00:36:06,870
It is a constraint that works for me
in this case because I can't make sell

542
00:36:06,871 --> 00:36:10,190
decisions at the wrong time.
It is out of my hands. Uh,

543
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,170
that does not suit everyone's
intestinal fortitude.

544
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:16,250
It just happens to suit
my weird psychology. Uh,

545
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:20,790
the unfair advantage I mentioned I would
come back to is really only playing

546
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,310
with a stacked deck.
Uh,

547
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:28,320
so I do not make investments in startups
where I cannot materially impact

548
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:35,600
directly the value of that company or
from the selection standpoint when I have

549
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:42,000
a, unless I have a significant
informational advantage.

550
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:45,090
And when I lived in silicon valley,
was there for 17 years,

551
00:36:45,091 --> 00:36:48,390
I lived in the middle of the switchbox
and I made every effort to ensure that I

552
00:36:48,391 --> 00:36:52,800
was in the hub of information flow.
So I knew about things,

553
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:57,180
uh, weeks, months in some
cases, years in advance.

554
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:02,610
And that enabled me to
make better decisions as to
where it should allocate the

555
00:37:02,611 --> 00:37:06,060
Tim first fund and the first two years
certainly, which worked out very,

556
00:37:06,061 --> 00:37:10,560
very well and had some great teachers who
have all talked about their approaches

557
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:15,210
for investing on this podcast.
Uh, naval Ravikant. Incredible.

558
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:19,920
So you can go to tim.blog forward slash
and if all you can go to tim.blog,

559
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:24,060
uh, forward slash. Let's see. Actually
it might not be a forward slash,

560
00:37:24,061 --> 00:37:28,950
but if you look up Mike maples and a p, l,
e s, he's another one who has been very,

561
00:37:28,951 --> 00:37:32,250
very consistently good and so
on and so forth. All right,

562
00:37:32,251 --> 00:37:35,880
so this is a long answer, but
for financial freedom, uh,

563
00:37:35,881 --> 00:37:40,470
first understanding how to get
out of debt or how to manage debt,

564
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:43,230
uh, I use very, very
little debt in my life.

565
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:45,570
Some people are very
comfortable with that. I am not.

566
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:50,700
And being better with money is in
part not being afraid of money.

567
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:53,280
And also,
uh,

568
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:58,310
learning how to take small steps and
moderate actions with limited downside

569
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:05,930
rather than being paralyzed by any
insecurities or fears you might have about

570
00:38:06,301 --> 00:38:06,900
money.

571
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:11,900
So book that I think holistically can
help with that is how to stop worrying and

572
00:38:12,271 --> 00:38:16,830
start living by Dale Carnegie has
nothing directly to do with money,

573
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:21,210
but it does have everything to do with
how you might interact with money.

574
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:22,170
Uh,

575
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:27,170
the last thing I would say is coming
back again to financial freedom is to

576
00:38:28,321 --> 00:38:33,321
correct a misconception about the
spectrum between full time employed an

577
00:38:36,191 --> 00:38:38,200
entrepreneur.
Uh,

578
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:41,580
there is the erroneous belief
of the false dichotomy that,

579
00:38:41,581 --> 00:38:45,670
that these things exist completely
separately. In other words that you,

580
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:50,820
you're either a nine to fiver or work
for someone else or you quit that job and

581
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:56,080
chase your dreams and your
full time entrepreneur. Uh,

582
00:38:56,081 --> 00:39:01,081
I don't recommend in most cases that
you make that black and white leap.

583
00:39:02,141 --> 00:39:02,740
In fact,

584
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:07,740
it makes much more sense to moonlight
to side Gig on the say the weekends or

585
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:14,130
Saturdays for a period of time so that
you can both assess and evaluate your

586
00:39:15,281 --> 00:39:17,980
ideas for a company.
Uh,

587
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:22,981
but also assess and evaluate your own
abilities as an entrepreneur to for

588
00:39:23,291 --> 00:39:26,260
instance, structure time that
is otherwise unstructured,

589
00:39:26,261 --> 00:39:31,060
to set your own rules and policies instead
of having them set by someone else or

590
00:39:31,061 --> 00:39:33,500
some type of company environment.
Uh,

591
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:38,550
and not everyone is suited
to the uncertainty that
you face as an entrepreneur

592
00:39:39,161 --> 00:39:42,880
on an ongoing basis. And there's
nothing wrong with that. Uh, it's,

593
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:46,530
it comes down to accurately assessing
your strengths and weaknesses, uh,

594
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:50,050
which certainly applies to investment.
And guess what? It's all investment,

595
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:55,180
investment of money, time,
energy, attention. These are
all investment decisions.

596
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:59,800
All right. I covered the asset allocation
and why you should never copy me.

597
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:05,170
And, uh, let's go to the
next. All right. Hi Tim.

598
00:40:05,171 --> 00:40:07,420
I know this is a bit out of your
normal focus, but I'm curious,

599
00:40:07,421 --> 00:40:10,770
do you have a philosophy about
having or not having children up?

600
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:14,620
This is one of the undecided
categories. Uh, so hopefully my,

601
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:19,480
my somewhat non-answer will be reassuring
to people who are in a similar place.

602
00:40:19,481 --> 00:40:22,850
But, uh, I'm conflicted about this, uh,

603
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:27,850
because on on one hand, if we're
talking about investing and betting,

604
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:32,910
let's just say if I look at the divorce
rates in the United States and the

605
00:40:32,951 --> 00:40:36,960
damage that can be done, certainly based
on talking to my friends who are the,

606
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:41,230
the children of divorced
parents by divorce, uh,

607
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:46,990
I wouldn't bet on marriage
the institution, uh,

608
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:49,270
to support,
uh,

609
00:40:49,271 --> 00:40:54,070
or rather to have a fantastic
outcome if I were betting on, uh,

610
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:58,900
on partnerships the way that
I would bet on startups,

611
00:40:58,901 --> 00:41:03,130
I wouldn't bet on partnerships period a
longterm and whether they're within the

612
00:41:03,131 --> 00:41:07,360
confines of marriage or
have some other arrangement.

613
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:08,610
Uh,

614
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:13,300
so there's a lot of hesitancy on
my part for all those reasons.

615
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:18,220
Uh, the, there are other ways to
look at this. Of course, very,

616
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:23,310
there are friends of mine who are either
divorced or are probably headed towards

617
00:41:24,341 --> 00:41:27,880
divorce. And I would ask them, uh,

618
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:32,530
if the only way they could have
their kids was to get married,

619
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:35,750
knowing they would absolutely get a
divorce, would they still have their kids?

620
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:40,430
And the answer is invariably, yes.
Now, is this confirmation bias?

621
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:41,031
At this point,

622
00:41:41,031 --> 00:41:45,860
probably it would be very hard for any
parent with a heart to say absolutely

623
00:41:45,861 --> 00:41:48,410
not. I would unwind the
clock and not have my kids.

624
00:41:48,411 --> 00:41:51,380
I have yet to meet anyone
who has said that. Uh,

625
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:55,850
and then there are folks, for
instance, Jersey Gregorich,

626
00:41:55,940 --> 00:42:00,140
the Olympic weightlifting champion
who's 63 right now, I believe in,

627
00:42:00,141 --> 00:42:02,570
I would consider one of my mentors.
He's in my ted talk,

628
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:06,290
if you're interested to learn more about
him. Uh, Tim. Dot. Blog forward slash ted.

629
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:11,360
But, uh, he has said to me privately, I
don't think he would mind me sharing this,

630
00:42:11,361 --> 00:42:14,000
but he's like, ah, because I asked him how
I should think about kids. And he said,

631
00:42:14,001 --> 00:42:17,030
well, you know, if you're a
guy you get past the age of x,

632
00:42:17,031 --> 00:42:19,730
I think he was saying like 45 50
and you don't have kids. He's like,

633
00:42:19,731 --> 00:42:24,320
that's just weird. He is
a very direct, he's like,

634
00:42:24,321 --> 00:42:28,640
you just go crazy inside your own head if
you don't have kids by that point. And,

635
00:42:28,641 --> 00:42:28,900
uh,

636
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:33,900
I think the simplicity that is actually
really profound and that the fact of the

637
00:42:33,921 --> 00:42:38,090
matter is I may get to a point
where my biological imperative,

638
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:43,150
the Darwinian evolution that has led me
to this point being alive on this planet

639
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:47,300
in this particular period in time,
uh,

640
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:51,560
to want to have kids or feel
the need to have kids, uh,

641
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:55,640
despite any arguments to the contrary.

642
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:57,110
And,
uh,

643
00:42:57,590 --> 00:43:02,420
at that point I might say fuck it
and pull the trigger and have kids.

644
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:06,830
Although I recognize that
it's not always that simple.

645
00:43:06,831 --> 00:43:11,831
And a lot of men assume that the fertility
piece of the equation is problematic

646
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:14,570
if the woman has problems.
But I will tell you right now,

647
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:19,600
given the trending that I have seen and
morphology motility in a sperm among men

648
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:25,460
and decreases in testosterone and
everything else due to factors,

649
00:43:25,461 --> 00:43:27,710
we can cover another time,
uh,

650
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:32,800
that it's never quite or very often not
as simple as people would like to think.

651
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:37,820
Uh, and that the fertility problems
experienced by couples are very much,

652
00:43:37,970 --> 00:43:38,421
uh,

653
00:43:38,421 --> 00:43:43,421
are very often attributable to the
men and not necessarily the woman.

654
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:45,140
All right?

655
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:50,140
Next you often ask your interviewees for
their advice for a younger person or a

656
00:43:51,111 --> 00:43:52,250
younger version of themselves,

657
00:43:52,251 --> 00:43:55,490
what advice have you distilled from your
guests or your own experience that we

658
00:43:55,491 --> 00:43:58,130
would be appropriate for those over 40?

659
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:00,920
And I'll keep this super short,
uh,

660
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:06,070
this answer or I say this question and
the assorted answers from guests are most

661
00:44:07,701 --> 00:44:09,770
represented in my last two books,

662
00:44:09,771 --> 00:44:13,520
tools of titans and especially tribe of
mentors where you see many, many, many,

663
00:44:13,521 --> 00:44:17,990
many different options.
And with rare exception,

664
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:23,560
the advice that would apply to those
over 40 is exactly the same advice that,

665
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:29,230
that these various guests would give to
younger people with the exception of,

666
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:34,850
uh, perhaps risking it all
in some capacity because you,

667
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:38,010
you don't have mortgages,
you don't have kids, right?

668
00:44:38,011 --> 00:44:41,760
So apart from the hey kid,

669
00:44:41,761 --> 00:44:44,370
you should try the crazy stuff
because you have no mortgage, no kids,

670
00:44:44,371 --> 00:44:49,080
no real responsibilities. Aside from that
advice, which is really a small subset,

671
00:44:49,081 --> 00:44:54,000
maybe 10 to 15% of the answers,
all of the rest of the advice applies.

672
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:57,030
Uh, the reason I ask, what would you,

673
00:44:57,150 --> 00:45:00,450
what advice would you give your younger
self or what advice would you give a

674
00:45:00,451 --> 00:45:04,770
high school senior or a college senior?

675
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:08,520
Is that the people I'm interviewing
feel qualified to give that advice.

676
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:10,080
Whereas if I said,

677
00:45:10,081 --> 00:45:15,081
what advice would you give to every four
year old and they're 35 or they're 45

678
00:45:15,511 --> 00:45:19,560
or maybe even 60,
they will be more reserved in,

679
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:24,870
in the prescription of advice
for those older groups than they,

680
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:27,910
than they will be with the younger groups.
And so it's,

681
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:32,960
it's really a tactical decision on my
part also just to get a more relaxed,

682
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:37,410
less edited answer from these
people. All right. Next question.

683
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:40,770
Do you think people who are
introverted should practice, develop,

684
00:45:40,771 --> 00:45:44,310
learn to be more extroverted or just
embrace being introvert? You can do both.

685
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,410
I would consider myself an introvert,

686
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:51,620
a at least as defined by someone who is
recharged by being alone are with very,

687
00:45:51,901 --> 00:45:54,670
very few people. And, uh,

688
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:57,150
I've never taken the Myers Briggs test,

689
00:45:57,210 --> 00:46:02,070
but I'm constantly told I'm an
I n t j second most frequent,

690
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:07,170
uh,
what the precise term diagnosis would be.

691
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:09,720
INTP but,
uh,

692
00:46:09,721 --> 00:46:14,190
certainly I would consider myself an
introvert who has trained himself to for

693
00:46:14,191 --> 00:46:15,390
short periods of time,

694
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:20,130
be an extrovert a and get up on
stage and give speeches and so on.

695
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:25,190
But I avoid large groups
nearly all of the time.

696
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:28,590
And even if I go to a large dinner party,

697
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:34,010
I will frequently take five minute breaks
every half hour or so just to recharge

698
00:46:35,701 --> 00:46:36,750
and gather my bearings.

699
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:41,220
So I take a lot of bathroom breaks when
I go to group events or conferences or

700
00:46:41,221 --> 00:46:42,054
anything like that.

701
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:47,370
So you don't need to be more extroverted
at all. It depends a lot on your goals,

702
00:46:47,371 --> 00:46:51,240
but they're certainly very introverted,
uh,

703
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:54,390
high performers with exceptional careers,

704
00:46:54,391 --> 00:46:59,391
both inside of companies as
employees or entrepreneurs.

705
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:03,840
And then outside of companies are in
their own companies as entrepreneurs and

706
00:47:03,841 --> 00:47:04,674
even CEOs,

707
00:47:04,710 --> 00:47:09,710
you do not need to be a flamboyant PT
Barnum Steve Jobs type to be an effective

708
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:11,890
executive at all.
So it's,

709
00:47:11,891 --> 00:47:14,970
it's really dependent on your objectives.

710
00:47:14,971 --> 00:47:19,200
I will say that I agree
with Warren Buffet, uh,

711
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:24,350
that public speaking is one of the best
investments you can make some type of

712
00:47:24,571 --> 00:47:25,404
training course.

713
00:47:25,590 --> 00:47:30,590
I believe that he was part of toastmasters
or it may have just been a course he

714
00:47:30,641 --> 00:47:31,600
took in public speaking.

715
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:36,670
But when you take the ability
to communicate messages
effectively to groups of

716
00:47:36,671 --> 00:47:39,310
people and layer it on top
of almost anything else,

717
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:43,790
you automatically put yourself
into rarefied company. Uh,

718
00:47:43,810 --> 00:47:48,220
so public speaking I do
think is a useful skill. Uh,

719
00:47:48,221 --> 00:47:50,510
and in fact even a necessary skill,
uh,

720
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:53,260
depending on where your
decision tree takes you in life.

721
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:56,710
So that would be one addition.
Even if you are introverted,

722
00:47:56,770 --> 00:48:00,760
I would suggest getting better at some
type and practicing public speaking.

723
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:04,060
All right. Next question. Uh,

724
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:09,010
how do you arrange the interior
of your home? Uh, example,

725
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:12,190
given layout items, displayed,
restored furnishings, et Cetera,

726
00:48:12,191 --> 00:48:16,000
to optimize your mental
state and effectiveness. Is
this a consideration? Yes,

727
00:48:16,001 --> 00:48:19,720
this is a major consideration
for me. And, uh,

728
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:22,030
I am not perfect by any
stretch of the imagination,

729
00:48:22,031 --> 00:48:27,031
but I do spend a lot of time at home
and I would say just a few things are,

730
00:48:27,690 --> 00:48:29,170
are particularly important to me.

731
00:48:29,171 --> 00:48:33,190
I dislike clutter in any of my living
spaces like a living room. For instance,

732
00:48:33,191 --> 00:48:34,330
I'm in my living room right now.

733
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:39,750
I have artwork up that
elicits very positive emotions
for me and I have books up

734
00:48:41,530 --> 00:48:45,850
that elicit positive enabling
emotions or memories for me.

735
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:50,800
So for instance, I have up on the wall,
I have a photograph that Matt Mullenweg,

736
00:48:50,801 --> 00:48:53,310
my buddy's CEO of Automattic,
uh,

737
00:48:53,410 --> 00:48:58,410
one of the lead developers of wordpress
took when we were traveling in Vietnam.

738
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:03,540
And that is up on a shelf to remind me
of that particular trip where I was able

739
00:49:04,271 --> 00:49:08,560
to say no and take time off the grid
without any side effects or negative

740
00:49:08,561 --> 00:49:09,880
consequences that I can recall.

741
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:15,660
Then I have a book from Jocko Willink
that is the discipline equals freedom

742
00:49:16,511 --> 00:49:17,610
field manual.
Uh,

743
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:22,450
because I'm a fan of Jocko and
whenever I'm being a complete wimp, uh,

744
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:25,090
with any decisions that
need to make ownership,

745
00:49:25,091 --> 00:49:28,540
I need to take or a
discomfort I need to face,

746
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:32,620
then Jacos on the shelf yelling at me.
There I have the Ketogenic Bible,

747
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:37,060
a book called less is more just an
anthology of writing on minimalism.

748
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:42,220
I have the essential Rumi poetry,
a book called braiding sweetgrass,

749
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:46,120
the novel Musashi, uh,
two books on Musashi,

750
00:49:46,121 --> 00:49:50,980
actually a Miyamoto Musashi who is
fought to be one of the greatest,

751
00:49:50,981 --> 00:49:54,370
if not the greatest swordsman
in Japanese history. Uh,

752
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:58,330
a book called the book of laughter
and forgetting by Milan Kundera,

753
00:49:58,331 --> 00:50:03,331
which I have a lot of positive association
with a Ray Daleo principles and then

754
00:50:04,390 --> 00:50:07,810
go boards and other things.
A woodblock prints.

755
00:50:08,230 --> 00:50:11,950
And I'm listing off a few things
here. Just see, you have an idea,

756
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:14,040
a photograph of a,

757
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:18,610
an Olympic weightlifter in a training
hall doing clean and jerk with several

758
00:50:18,610 --> 00:50:23,200
hundred pounds.
The nameplate in effect,

759
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:26,620
it's a piece of fabric that was stitched
into the back of my Judah uniform when

760
00:50:26,621 --> 00:50:31,130
I competed in judo as an exchange
student in Japan at age 15.

761
00:50:31,430 --> 00:50:36,050
So I unstitched that from my judogi when
I was 15 and I've carried it with me

762
00:50:36,051 --> 00:50:41,000
ever since with my name and my school
name underneath that and so on and so

763
00:50:41,001 --> 00:50:44,630
forth. A lot of wildlife,
a lot of scenery.

764
00:50:44,631 --> 00:50:49,631
So I have panoramic shots of waterfalls
and ponds in the Pacific northwest,

765
00:50:50,961 --> 00:50:55,310
like Oregon. I've photograph of a gigantic
grizzly bear coming out of the water,

766
00:50:55,610 --> 00:50:59,180
I think it's called majesty rising,
which is a photograph by Paul Nicklen,

767
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:03,200
a national geographic photographer.
He was just incredible.

768
00:51:03,201 --> 00:51:05,000
And one of the few people I follow,

769
00:51:05,001 --> 00:51:08,870
one of the few photographers
I follow on Instagram,

770
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:13,220
Cristina Mittermeier as well. Uh, it
would be, it would be high up, but yes,

771
00:51:13,221 --> 00:51:18,221
I think a lot about what is placed
around my home and what type of emotional

772
00:51:19,491 --> 00:51:21,620
states they prompt.
Uh,

773
00:51:21,621 --> 00:51:26,030
so that is short answer to that.
All right,

774
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:28,520
next question.
Uh,

775
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:32,940
productivity for non type a people,
much of your advice.

776
00:51:32,941 --> 00:51:36,290
And that of your guests seems to be aimed
at people who thrive with setting and

777
00:51:36,291 --> 00:51:37,400
maintaining routines.

778
00:51:37,401 --> 00:51:40,610
Do you have advice for those of us who
are ambitious but see routines is an

779
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:44,030
undesirable daily grind? Uh, yes,

780
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:46,760
I do have advice and it
is not avoid routines.

781
00:51:46,761 --> 00:51:51,761
It is to reframe routines as something
enabling it is a positive constraint that

782
00:51:54,381 --> 00:51:58,880
allows you to avoid decision fatigue
and allocate your brain power and the

783
00:51:58,881 --> 00:52:02,780
creative competitive advantages to
the things that actually matter,

784
00:52:02,781 --> 00:52:07,340
which is not choosing what to have for
breakfast in the morning or deciding

785
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:11,180
which coffee shop to go
to, etc. Uh, routines.

786
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:14,810
I think this is w h outdone from
getting the name correct. Uh,

787
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:18,120
should be seen as a in the
intelligent man be seen.

788
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:21,560
And that's of course people in general
seen in the intelligent man as a sign of

789
00:52:21,561 --> 00:52:22,720
ambition.
Uh,

790
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:27,940
so instead of seeing routines
as an undesirable daily
grind to reframe routines,

791
00:52:30,470 --> 00:52:31,101
rituals,

792
00:52:31,101 --> 00:52:36,101
if you prefer that word as scaffolding
around which you can craft your best life

793
00:52:38,210 --> 00:52:41,500
without that, every day is
a free for all. And it's,

794
00:52:41,530 --> 00:52:46,040
it's effectively an unwritten script
that you have to write every single day

795
00:52:46,041 --> 00:52:50,990
before you can even think about how to
perform the script best you have to write

796
00:52:50,991 --> 00:52:51,140
it.

797
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:56,140
And that draws upon your very limited
resources in an incredible draining way,

798
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:57,133
in my experience.

799
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:00,740
So my answer is not to get rid of
routines and not to avoid routines,

800
00:53:00,741 --> 00:53:03,080
but to reframe them as the scaffolding,

801
00:53:03,081 --> 00:53:08,081
the reliable scaffolding around which
you can then build your best life every

802
00:53:10,310 --> 00:53:15,310
day and utilize your unique strengths
in the least wasteful way possible.

803
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:23,750
All right. Uh, next question. And
I only have four or five left here.

804
00:53:24,170 --> 00:53:28,020
All right. So the next question
is, how's life in Austin?

805
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:31,320
Have you designed or chosen a new house
according to any changes that you've

806
00:53:31,321 --> 00:53:35,040
wanted to make in your lifestyle?
Uh, I'll answer the first piece. Uh,

807
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:36,360
Austin's great.
I've,

808
00:53:36,361 --> 00:53:41,361
I'm living in Austin has made me fall
more in love with the city then simply

809
00:53:41,971 --> 00:53:43,320
visiting.
And that was a concern.

810
00:53:43,321 --> 00:53:46,480
I wasn't sure what it would be like
living here as an Austinite, uh,

811
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:48,960
but it's absolutely spectacular
and I'm exceptionally,

812
00:53:48,961 --> 00:53:51,600
exceptionally bullish on Austin.
Uh,

813
00:53:51,601 --> 00:53:55,860
so I've doubled and tripled and quadrupled
down on this town. A very, very,

814
00:53:55,861 --> 00:53:58,800
very big fan. I'll keep it short. But if
you haven't visited at the very least,

815
00:53:58,950 --> 00:54:03,120
live music capital of the u s
fantastic barbecue friendly people.

816
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:07,980
It's, it's a great town. So I encourage
everybody to check it out. Next questions.

817
00:54:08,510 --> 00:54:09,090
Uh,

818
00:54:09,090 --> 00:54:14,090
what questions should they ask themselves
to determine there were of happiness.

819
00:54:14,821 --> 00:54:19,400
I've talked about where of happiness and
how I ended up at Austin for myself. Uh,

820
00:54:19,410 --> 00:54:23,790
the easiest way to determine, and just
as context people think about the what,

821
00:54:23,791 --> 00:54:26,520
what should I do? The who
should I spend time with, the Y,

822
00:54:26,550 --> 00:54:30,270
etc. Of determining
their optimal happiness,

823
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:33,540
what job should I do and what type
of people should I spend time around?

824
00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:38,040
And the wear is very important.
The geography,

825
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:43,220
the city or state place in which you
put yourself a determines a lot of these

826
00:54:44,521 --> 00:54:47,250
other things.
My recommendation is to do an 80,

827
00:54:47,251 --> 00:54:51,120
20 analysis of your last calendar year.

828
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:54,300
So I'm recording this in late February,
but it doesn't really matter.

829
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:57,120
Go back and look at your
calendar for the last year.

830
00:54:57,540 --> 00:54:59,220
This should only take an afternoon.
Really.

831
00:54:59,221 --> 00:55:01,200
You can do it on a Saturday for instance,

832
00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:05,890
or a Sunday and go through and uh,
you,

833
00:55:05,950 --> 00:55:07,470
you will fill in two columns.

834
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:12,470
The first column is the 20% of people
are activities that produced a peak

835
00:55:13,470 --> 00:55:16,770
positive emotional states.
Most of the time,

836
00:55:17,330 --> 00:55:20,160
my peak positive emotional states,

837
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:25,560
the 20% of say, people in activities
that produce 80% of the joy,

838
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:27,900
so to speak,
on the other side,

839
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:32,460
you're going to have the 20% of people
or activities that produced 80% of the

840
00:55:32,461 --> 00:55:37,290
negative emotional states, the
irritation, the frustration,

841
00:55:37,291 --> 00:55:40,230
the annoyance, uh, the anger,

842
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:45,120
etc. And you're going to make a list in
that column that's going to be or not to

843
00:55:45,121 --> 00:55:46,860
do list. All right? Uh,

844
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:51,750
then you're gonna look at the positive
and you're going to look for a different

845
00:55:51,751 --> 00:55:56,751
locations that have a high density
slash ease of encountering those things.

846
00:55:57,660 --> 00:55:58,291
So for instance,

847
00:55:58,291 --> 00:56:02,940
I noticed in my own calculus that
acroyoga correlated to a high degree of

848
00:56:02,941 --> 00:56:06,300
happiness for me. If I practice
acro yoga a few times a week,

849
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:10,140
and if you want to see what the hell
that is, just look up acro yoga,

850
00:56:10,590 --> 00:56:15,150
like acrobatic yoga, acro yoga,
Tim Ferris on, uh, the youtubes.

851
00:56:15,570 --> 00:56:19,290
Uh, you could also go to
youtube.com forward slash
timferriss and you'll see some

852
00:56:19,291 --> 00:56:24,040
video of this including me putting
a Jimmy Fallon up on my feet. And,

853
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:24,580
uh,

854
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:29,290
I then looked on Facebook at different
cities and the Acro Yoga community in

855
00:56:29,291 --> 00:56:34,090
Austin, Texas is gigantic. It's
larger, at least based on Facebook.

856
00:56:34,330 --> 00:56:38,320
Then the acro yoga community in
the bay area where it was created,

857
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:39,580
which blew my mind.

858
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:44,530
So that was then one of the positive
checkboxes when I was looking for density

859
00:56:44,531 --> 00:56:49,531
slash ease of things based on a calendar
audit that have created a reliable

860
00:56:52,510 --> 00:56:57,510
degree of happiness and improved quality
of life through doing that exercise.

861
00:56:58,930 --> 00:57:01,480
So that's what I would do next up.

862
00:57:01,510 --> 00:57:05,620
If for some reason or another you could
record only one more podcast who'd you

863
00:57:05,621 --> 00:57:10,600
interview and why they can be dead or
alive. I would interview my parents, uh,

864
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:15,630
because I would want to have that record
really just for myself of having a long

865
00:57:15,641 --> 00:57:20,170
form conversation with them and
capturing their story and their wisdom.

866
00:57:20,510 --> 00:57:25,210
I don't think I would share that for
public consumption, but just for me,

867
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:29,590
which is actually a recommendation that
I received from a name that I mentioned

868
00:57:29,591 --> 00:57:33,070
earlier in this podcast. Matt Mullenweg
one of the sweetest, smartest guys I know,

869
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:37,090
uh, who's also been on this podcast
talking about building companies, uh,

870
00:57:37,091 --> 00:57:39,670
automatic. His company's worth more
than a billion dollars at this point,

871
00:57:39,671 --> 00:57:44,590
I believe, and has a distributed
architecture of four or 500 employees.

872
00:57:44,591 --> 00:57:46,030
It's really fascinating.
In any case,

873
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:50,380
he made that recommendation to me and
this is a good reminder to get on it.

874
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:54,940
So thanks for that Matt. And thanks for
this question to remind me. Next question.

875
00:57:54,941 --> 00:57:58,540
What are the pros cons
of a silent retreat? Uh,

876
00:57:58,570 --> 00:58:03,570
the pros would be similar to
some psychedelic experiences.

877
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:09,480
Not that I would recommend those in any
illegal context or in an unsupervised

878
00:58:09,521 --> 00:58:13,240
fashion whatsoever.
But when you do a 10 day silent retreat,

879
00:58:13,241 --> 00:58:18,100
which I made significantly harder
for myself by fasting during,

880
00:58:18,101 --> 00:58:23,101
so I fasted for about seven days to prior
to ensure that I was to adapted five

881
00:58:24,131 --> 00:58:28,360
during a for the first half of
my 10 day silent retreat. It,

882
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:33,480
that type of experience shows you the
breadth and depth of experience possible

883
00:58:34,331 --> 00:58:37,720
through meditation. So you will see
the best you will see the worst.

884
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:40,930
You will be listless than you will be.
Uh,

885
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:45,160
you will be not fatigued.
You'll be restless. You'll want,

886
00:58:45,161 --> 00:58:48,880
you'll be bouncing off the walls
with no real clear explanation. Uh,

887
00:58:48,881 --> 00:58:53,230
you will have profound
moments of peace and uh,

888
00:58:53,410 --> 00:58:57,850
and thoughtlessness or your ego seems
to dissolve and then you will have times

889
00:58:57,851 --> 00:59:00,250
when, like me, right
before I broke my fast,

890
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:03,310
the only two thoughts in my head were
fried chicken, Calamari, fried chicken,

891
00:59:03,311 --> 00:59:05,350
Calamari, fried chicken,
calamine for like three hours.

892
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:08,790
And then the next day it
was like ass porn as porn.

893
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:11,950
Just thinking about porn
basically for three hours,

894
00:59:11,951 --> 00:59:16,630
which might sound reasonably
good. It was awful. Uh,

895
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:20,680
particularly when you're trying to focus
on your breathing or do something else

896
00:59:20,710 --> 00:59:21,950
other than thinking about such things.

897
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:26,720
So it will show you the breadth and
depth of the experience possible through

898
00:59:26,990 --> 00:59:31,610
meditation and that can then inform your
later practice. So when you have these,

899
00:59:32,270 --> 00:59:37,270
perhaps rare or at least intermittent
experiences of profound peace and feeling

900
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:40,910
at ease with yourself and
everything in the world,

901
00:59:41,510 --> 00:59:46,510
and perhaps even the disillusion of
the self in the sense that you feel

902
00:59:46,581 --> 00:59:47,840
connected to all people,

903
00:59:47,841 --> 00:59:52,841
all things that can be a
very tantalizing epiphany,

904
00:59:52,970 --> 00:59:55,220
uh, beautiful, uh,

905
00:59:55,940 --> 01:00:00,650
experience that then motivates
you to meditate later. Uh,

906
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:05,750
similar to the effect that
psychedelics had on Sam Harris Phd,

907
01:00:05,751 --> 01:00:09,950
who I mentioned earlier,
uh, who then, uh, has,

908
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:13,940
has passed on. Psychedelics no
longer uses psychedelics, but, uh,

909
01:00:13,941 --> 01:00:17,210
used that experience,
that promise, so to speak,

910
01:00:17,211 --> 01:00:18,230
the light at the end of the tunnel.

911
01:00:18,231 --> 01:00:23,030
Having the firsthand opportunity
to do that through psychedelics,

912
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:26,840
uh, to then drive his meditation
practice, which is now very,

913
01:00:26,841 --> 01:00:31,220
very well developed and a lifeline for
him that is available at any given moment.

914
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:32,633
Right?

915
01:00:32,950 --> 01:00:37,900
So those are few of the pros
of the seller treat cons.

916
01:00:38,230 --> 01:00:43,190
All right. And not unlike a
powerful psychedelic experience. Uh,

917
01:00:43,191 --> 01:00:44,570
I would say out of 100 people,

918
01:00:44,571 --> 01:00:49,571
10 to 15% are going to have a as close
to a psychotic break as one can imagine

919
01:00:51,951 --> 01:00:56,090
or an actual psychotic break.
And that is terrifying.

920
01:00:56,300 --> 01:01:00,980
And I was in that 10 to 15% in the
silent retreat and I think I had a longer

921
01:01:00,981 --> 01:01:04,010
conversation about this with uh,

922
01:01:04,070 --> 01:01:08,810
Dan Harris on his podcast,
10% happier. And also on a,

923
01:01:09,470 --> 01:01:10,820
an episode of this podcast,

924
01:01:10,821 --> 01:01:14,630
which should be out by the time you
hear this or it's coming up very,

925
01:01:14,631 --> 01:01:17,990
very shortly after this
episode with Jack Kornfield,

926
01:01:18,770 --> 01:01:23,770
who was in fact the person who saved me
and allowed me to return to having my

927
01:01:24,981 --> 01:01:28,430
feet on the ground well enough to leave
the silent retreat after that 10 day

928
01:01:28,431 --> 01:01:32,480
silent retreat at spirit rock and Woodacre
California. So I would encourage you,

929
01:01:32,481 --> 01:01:34,840
if you want more details on that,
oh,

930
01:01:35,450 --> 01:01:38,780
you didn't expect to be in that 10 to 15%,

931
01:01:38,781 --> 01:01:42,740
which you weren't even told in advanced.
But congratulations slash Oh,

932
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:44,480
you are in that 10 to 15%,

933
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:48,890
and you can really be destabilized in a
very serious way by such an experience.

934
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:49,420
Uh,

935
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:52,730
so I'd encourage you to check out Dan
Harris podcast with me for more than that

936
01:01:52,790 --> 01:01:54,260
or,
uh,

937
01:01:54,350 --> 01:01:59,350
even better perhaps is to listen to my
very in depth conversation with Jack

938
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:05,120
Kornfield about exactly this.
All right. Two more questions.

939
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:09,650
Why have you not illustrated
or sketched in your books?

940
01:02:09,651 --> 01:02:13,040
You've mentioned a few times
that you dreamed of being,
becoming a sketch artist.

941
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:15,740
Why not experiment and your books?
And this is true.

942
01:02:15,830 --> 01:02:19,950
I was actually an illustrator through
much of high school and part of college

943
01:02:19,951 --> 01:02:23,220
for paying my expenses. And
then I just stopped. I mean,

944
01:02:23,221 --> 01:02:28,221
there's also the graphics editor of the
Princeton Tiger magazine at Princeton

945
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:30,150
when I was there,
uh,

946
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:35,160
and have designed all of the covers of
my books with the exception of tools of

947
01:02:35,161 --> 01:02:35,870
titans.

948
01:02:35,870 --> 01:02:40,500
Then have had professional illustrators
slash designers come in to do the

949
01:02:40,501 --> 01:02:41,490
production versions.

950
01:02:41,491 --> 01:02:45,840
But I have drawn out all of the covers
of my books starting with four hour work

951
01:02:45,841 --> 01:02:49,980
week. Um, the, uh,

952
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:54,930
so there's no reason I couldn't do a
62nd sketch each day for say Instagram,

953
01:02:54,931 --> 01:02:56,790
but the books are after the Polish.

954
01:02:56,791 --> 01:03:01,680
I don't want to serve up
my trial runs in a book.

955
01:03:01,730 --> 01:03:05,460
Uh, but many of the illustrations that
you see in say four hour chef were in fact

956
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:07,910
originally sketched out by me and then,
uh,

957
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:12,980
the Polish was thrown on for
the production by someone
who actually does that as

958
01:03:13,591 --> 01:03:14,340
a full time job.

959
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:19,240
But if you guys would like to see me do
a say a 62nd sketch each day, or I dunno,

960
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:22,990
62nd Sunday or something like that
where I throw up one drawing a week,

961
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:28,230
that would be a good way for me to get
back into it. So maybe I'll do that.

962
01:03:28,290 --> 01:03:32,490
Let me know what you guys think.
Okay. And the last question,

963
01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:36,480
Tim, I'm a huge fan of how you constantly
experiment and challenge yourself.

964
01:03:36,510 --> 01:03:40,710
So I'm asking you to push me and your
other listeners to do a 30 day challenge.

965
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:43,230
I am happy to do that.
And in fact,

966
01:03:43,231 --> 01:03:46,800
it's the same challenge that I'm assigning
myself and it's one that I've done

967
01:03:46,801 --> 01:03:51,360
before. This is not a 30 day.
Make it easier. The 21 day,

968
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:54,420
no complaint experiment.
And you can put this in your calendar.

969
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:58,110
Certainly there is an
overabundance of negativity,

970
01:03:58,470 --> 01:04:03,470
complaining and criticism on the Internet
and we lose fact of we lose sight of

971
01:04:06,031 --> 01:04:11,031
the fact that it is really a positive
reinforcement and applauding what you

972
01:04:11,521 --> 01:04:13,350
want,
uh,

973
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:18,740
and not exclusively punishing
or criticizing what you
do not like or want that

974
01:04:18,961 --> 01:04:19,950
elicits change.

975
01:04:19,951 --> 01:04:24,720
You do need certainly at least both and
positive reinforcement and that goes for

976
01:04:24,721 --> 01:04:29,340
yourself and your inner monologue,
your inner voice as well.

977
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:30,900
So you want to improve your life.

978
01:04:30,901 --> 01:04:35,901
And this is already been tested by tens
of thousands of folks via the blog.

979
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:41,010
If you want to tip the domino,
uh, like we discussed earlier,

980
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:46,080
that affects many, many other dominoes,
increases your quality of life,

981
01:04:46,650 --> 01:04:50,190
uh, doing a 21 day, no complaint.
Experiment is a really,

982
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:52,020
really effective way to go about that.

983
01:04:52,170 --> 01:04:57,170
And it also very quickly illuminates just
how often most of us complain without

984
01:04:58,470 --> 01:05:02,340
any type of outcome or
action coming out of it.

985
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:07,290
So check it out. If you go to
tim.blog/complaint I created redirect.

986
01:05:07,650 --> 01:05:12,630
So tim.blog forward slash complaint
that will take you to a blog post,

987
01:05:12,870 --> 01:05:14,790
which a you will see is a little dated.

988
01:05:14,860 --> 01:05:18,790
So don't mind the discussion of switching
to the Mac. That was some time ago,

989
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:24,130
but the headline is real mind
control and then subtitle the 21 day,

990
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:27,000
no complaint,
experiment and uh,

991
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:32,050
it takes you right through exactly how
to do it and exactly how I'm going to be

992
01:05:32,051 --> 01:05:36,940
doing it, uh, starting, uh, right
meow. So check it out. Tim. Dot.

993
01:05:36,941 --> 01:05:38,440
Blog slash complaint,

994
01:05:38,470 --> 01:05:42,610
that is the 21 day challenge that
I would recommend to everyone.

995
01:05:43,390 --> 01:05:45,680
And that is it. That is
the last question. Uh,

996
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:50,320
so with out dragging this out too long,

997
01:05:50,321 --> 01:05:53,080
I would say if you'd like to
ask me questions directly,

998
01:05:53,081 --> 01:05:57,910
if you would like to see what I am finding
most interesting in any given week,

999
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:01,810
whether that's articles,
gadgets, new apps, uh,

1000
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:05,620
elegant tech fixes. And work arounds
that a lot of my friends share with me.

1001
01:06:05,950 --> 01:06:09,190
New Investments. Uh, you name it.

1002
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:13,060
Really anything cool that
I am experimenting with
that I've found that I'm

1003
01:06:13,061 --> 01:06:13,894
pondering.

1004
01:06:14,140 --> 01:06:19,140
I sent out five short bullets every
Friday in five bullet Friday and you can

on average.

1008
01:06:29,650 --> 01:06:33,040
It's a lot of fun for me to put
together and people seem to be enjoying.

1009
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:37,090

01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:45,370
until next time. Thank you
so, so much for listening.

1012
01:06:46,780 --> 01:06:50,140
Hey guys, this is Tim again. Just a
few more things before you take off.

1013
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:53,110
Number one,
this is five bullet Friday.

1014
01:06:53,470 --> 01:06:56,380
Do you want to get a short email from me?

1015
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:59,050
Would you enjoy getting a short
email from me every Friday?

1016
01:06:59,470 --> 01:07:03,580
That provides a little more soul of
fun before the weekend and five bullet

1017
01:07:03,581 --> 01:07:03,910
Fridays.

1018
01:07:03,910 --> 01:07:08,470
A very short email where
I share the coolest things
I've found or that I've been

1019
01:07:08,471 --> 01:07:09,760
pondering over the week.

1020
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,760
That could include favorite new
albums that I've discovered.

1021
01:07:12,761 --> 01:07:16,210
It could include Gizmos and gadgets
and all sorts of weird shit that I've

1022
01:07:16,211 --> 01:07:20,530
somehow dug up in the other
world of the esoteric as I do.

1023
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:25,800
It could include favorite articles that
I've read and that I've shared with my

1024
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:29,200
close friends for instance,
and it's very short.

1025
01:07:29,290 --> 01:07:34,240
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness
before you head off for the weekend,

1026
01:07:34,330 --> 01:07:36,490
so if you want to receive that,
check it out.

1027
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:41,710
Just go to four hour work week.com that's
four hour workweek.com all spelled out

1028
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:45,700
and just drop in your email and you'll
get the very next one and if you sign up,

1029
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,930
I hope you enjoy it. This episode
is brought to you by legal zoom,

1030
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:53,290
which has been a longtime sponsor because
I've seen it help so many different

1031
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:54,393
businesses.

1032
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:58,540
Hundreds of thousands of businesses of
yours is listeners and even including

1033
01:07:58,541 --> 01:08:01,180
some guests on this
show such as wordpress,

1034
01:08:01,181 --> 01:08:04,780
the developer and automatic
founder Matt Mullenweg.

1035
01:08:05,140 --> 01:08:09,420
Legal Zoom is a reliable resource that
more than 1 million people have used to

1036
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:11,860
successfully launch and run businesses.

1037
01:08:12,290 --> 01:08:14,950
Legal Zoom has been helping people
take care of their dreams and

1038
01:08:15,230 --> 01:08:19,790
responsibilities. I've got
to protect those dreams,
folks for more than 16 years.

1039
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:21,073
They're not a law firm,

1040
01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:24,020
but they have the resources
to keep you on the right path,

1041
01:08:24,021 --> 01:08:27,410
including advice from their network
of independent attorneys all at your

1042
01:08:27,411 --> 01:08:28,244
fingertips,

1043
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:31,490
whether you want to take your business
to the next level or take control of your

1044
01:08:31,491 --> 01:08:33,890
family's future with an estate plan,
for instance.

1045
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:36,410
That's actually one of the places
I started with legal zooms,

1046
01:08:36,411 --> 01:08:38,990
looking at wills and so on,
related to estate planning.

1047
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:43,520
Legal Zoom has options so you can take
care of the things that matter most.

1048
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:48,140
Go to legal zoom.com and get special
savings when you entered Tim.

1049
01:08:48,620 --> 01:08:52,070
That's capital t I m in
the Promo box at checkout.

1050
01:08:52,580 --> 01:08:55,300
Special savings. What does
that mean? I'm not sure.

1051
01:08:55,320 --> 01:09:00,320
Mystery savings could be 1000% could be
1% could be 10% could be 27 and a half

1052
01:09:01,521 --> 01:09:02,354
percent I don't know.

1053
01:09:02,690 --> 01:09:06,290

1055
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:16,670
This episode is brought
to you by wordpress.com my
goto platform for blogging

1056
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:18,080
and creating websites.

1057
01:09:18,410 --> 01:09:23,270
wordpress.com which I've used for ages
now is the online home for this podcast,

1058
01:09:23,330 --> 01:09:28,130
tim.blog/podcast my blog and
all of my standalone book sites.

1059
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:31,850
So whether you're looking to create a
personal blog, a business site or both,

1060
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:35,810
creating your website on wordpress.com
helps others to find you,

1061
01:09:36,170 --> 01:09:38,170
remember you and connect with you.

1062
01:09:38,450 --> 01:09:42,230
Wordpress is designed for non technical
businesses and bloggers. That's me.

1063
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:44,750
I am not getting nitty gritty in the code.

1064
01:09:45,110 --> 01:09:47,840
You do not need experience
setting up a website.

1065
01:09:47,930 --> 01:09:51,170
They take care of the technical side
so it's easy to get your site up and

1066
01:09:51,171 --> 01:09:51,890
running.

1067
01:09:51,890 --> 01:09:56,360
Their customer support team is available
to help 24 hours a day and not just

1068
01:09:56,361 --> 01:10:00,560
Monday through Friday but also weekends.
And if you look at the bigger picture,

1069
01:10:00,561 --> 01:10:04,010
28% of all websites run on wordpress,

1070
01:10:04,070 --> 01:10:08,300
which is mind blowing when you consider
it and plans start at just $4 per month.

1071
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:13,720
Listeners of this podcast can receive
15% off any new planned purchase.

1072
01:10:14,150 --> 01:10:18,020
It's a good wordpress.com forward slash
Tim to create your website and find a

1073
01:10:18,021 --> 01:10:19,010
plan that's right for you.

1074
01:10:19,011 --> 01:10:24,011
If that's wordpress.com forward slash
10 for 15% off a brand new website.
