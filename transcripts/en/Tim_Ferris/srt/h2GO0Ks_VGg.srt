22

worry about security upgrades,

have used legal zoom to help
with their business needs,

43
00:02:48,551 --> 00:02:50,650

but legal zoom isn't just

Their services include everything from
helping you to manage changing tax laws,

nondisclosure agreements,
important stuff,

48
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:07,270
handling lease agreements and assisting

49
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:11,710
hurdle, inconvenience that typically takes
time and effort away from running your

business.

51
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:16,030
The best part is that you
won't get charged by the
hour because legal zoom isn't

52
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:20,890
a law firms so they won't be running the
clock up and spinning circles just to

53
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,780
raise your bill.

54
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:26,920
Instead they just ask you to pay one low
upfront price for whatever it is that

55
00:03:26,921 --> 00:03:28,450
you're looking to get all the card style,

He saw,
she booted on there every episode.

67
00:04:06,431 --> 00:04:11,431
It is my job to deconstruct world class
performers of different types and that

68
00:04:11,591 --> 00:04:15,040
term world class is going to come up
again in this episode so you can pay

69
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,300
attention to the context.

70
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:21,870
And this particular conversation I have
with me and Mira Co who has been called

71
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:26,950
quote the most powerful woman in startups
and quote by Forbes and is a lecturer

72
00:04:26,951 --> 00:04:28,600
in entrepreneurship at Stanford,

73
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:33,250
the child of a rocket scientist at NASA
that's a literal rocket scientists and

74
00:04:33,251 --> 00:04:37,270
is a Palo Alto native and has been steeped
in technology startups since she was

75
00:04:37,271 --> 00:04:39,640
a teenager.
Prior to cofounding floodgate,

76
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,850
she worked at Charles River
ventures and Mckinsey and company.

77
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:47,200
Some of her investments include Lyft. I
Yazdi, I'm gonna screw this up. I know it.

78
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:52,410
Xamarin refinery 29 joy run taskrabbit
and mod cloth given the success of her

79
00:04:53,021 --> 00:04:53,854
many investments,

80
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:59,070
she was on the 2017 midas list of top
100 venture capitalists and I just found

81
00:04:59,741 --> 00:05:04,741
out today back on 2018 elbowing her way
to the top to steal the crown from her

82
00:05:06,311 --> 00:05:07,570
partner, Mike Maples, Jr.

83
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:12,280
It's all good spirited Mike and
is known for so many other things.

84
00:05:12,281 --> 00:05:17,281
I'm going to skip some of them because
we're going to touch on the seeds of her.

85
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:21,430
Many, many accomplishments in perhaps
some of the first few minutes of the

86
00:05:21,431 --> 00:05:23,020
conversation.
Uh,

87
00:05:23,021 --> 00:05:27,240
she has a Yeahi hope I'm getting that
right from Yale and a phd from Stanford

88
00:05:27,241 --> 00:05:30,580
and math modeling of computer security.
She lives with her husband,

89
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:31,930
three kids age 10,

90
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:35,650
eight and six very well spaced
and one spoiled the hog.

91
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,810
And welcome to the show.
Thanks for having me.

92
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,730
So there's so many places we could start.
And I was,

93
00:05:44,731 --> 00:05:49,100
I was hoping to humanize the ever
intimidating and Miraco, which I,

94
00:05:49,101 --> 00:05:51,720
I may only partially succeed at doing.

95
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:56,800
But could we start with explaining

96
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:03,380
why your brother used to introduce you
or how he used to introduce you on stage?

97
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:07,160
Yeah, so I, I had this brother,

98
00:06:07,161 --> 00:06:11,390
an older brother by exactly two years,
were born on the same day,

99
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:15,920
and he was one of these
guys was so confident.

100
00:06:15,921 --> 00:06:20,921
He knew that he wanted to stay cars and
airplanes from the time that I could,

101
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,460
I could remember him existing. Um, and,

102
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,520
and he was always confident with friends
and he was also confident on stage.

103
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:35,690
And so as any good Asian child would do,

104
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,080
we played musical instruments.
I played the piano,

105
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:44,210
he played the violin,
and we would always have to perform.

106
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:48,320
And I was painfully,
painfully shy.

107
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,400
And so I would get up on stage
and I would refuse to speak.

108
00:06:52,401 --> 00:06:56,840
And My mother and knowing this
wouldn't let this get in the way of our

109
00:06:56,841 --> 00:06:57,674
performing,

110
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:01,910
she would send my brother up on stage
to help announce whatever I was playing.

111
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:07,270
And I have this real clear memory of
being in junior high and having this

112
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:11,960
happen. Uh, my brother got up
on stage and said, you know,

113
00:07:11,961 --> 00:07:16,370
this is an Mira. She's going to
be playing a Chopin Nocturne,

114
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,190
um,
and go and,

115
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,600
and I looked over and I
remember thinking to myself,

116
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:24,600
you know,

117
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:29,030
like they think the mental dialogue
that's happening in a teenagers mind,

118
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:32,090
this is totally ridiculous.

119
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:37,660
And because I'm sitting there in front
of a room full of people and I felt fine

120
00:07:37,971 --> 00:07:40,970
playing the piano,
but I felt petrified speaking.

121
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:46,550
And that's one of like the clearest
memories that I have of my brother and me

122
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:50,030
and the difference that we
had between the two of us.

123
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:53,480
Why are you so shy or
nervous about speaking?

124
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:59,480
You know, I, I've always
been an introvert,

125
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:03,260
so I think it comes
probably directly from that.

126
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:08,300
Um, but I was also sort
of, I was a strange child.

127
00:08:08,301 --> 00:08:11,570
I have to admit, I, I had a
lot of different interests,

128
00:08:11,571 --> 00:08:15,900
but I love to do things
by myself. Um, and,

129
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:20,570
and so I just didn't, I wasn't really that
interested in talking to other people.

130
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,493
Um,

131
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:26,330
like one of the first thing my mom
actually discovered about me when I was a

132
00:08:26,331 --> 00:08:30,350
little kid when I was two,
I only spoke Japanese. Um,

133
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:35,520
and we were living in Michigan and I used
to be this very hostile little child.

134
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:41,110
And I would walk by anyone
speaking in English.

135
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:45,990
And in Japanese I would say,
I wish you would leave. So,

136
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:54,170
you know, like, I can't even for mom,

137
00:08:54,171 --> 00:08:59,130
my poor mom. And so she was like, oh,
we really should socialize. And, um,

138
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,460
with people who speak English
and were living in Michigan.

139
00:09:02,461 --> 00:09:07,110
So there's no shortage of these people.
Do you, do you still speak Japanese?

140
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,830
I do.
So I speak Japanese to my parents.

141
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:13,080
How do you say,
I wish you,

142
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:17,580
I wish you would leave just for people
who want to monitor that to people in the

143
00:09:17,581 --> 00:09:21,020
park or wherever they might
be as do you recall or how,

144
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,520
how might you have said that as a kid?
Do you have any idea?

145
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:26,940
I think I might've said,
let me think about it.

146
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:29,660
At [inaudible]

147
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,270
that is aggressive.
That's really aggressive.

148
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:42,310
You're not welcome in this house.
Oh my God.

149
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:48,010
Gory. It was like, it was, I think
probably more likely it was Ooda cy. Nah.

150
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:52,360
Right, right. Oh Wow.
That's even worse. Right.

151
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,570
And so I know,

152
00:09:55,090 --> 00:10:00,060
I was like something that like
a drunk dad says, yeah. Yeah.

153
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:03,720
It's kind of like shut up. Yeah, you're
really loud. You're really irritating.

154
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:06,500
But like,
like a little intransigent,

155
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:10,580
two year old saying that to a grown
up speaking English in her home.

156
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:14,110
Okay. I don't want to take us
too far off the rails, but we,

157
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,000
we may come back to that.
Okay.

158
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:19,670
So we were talking about you being
introverted and shy and weird. Yeah.

159
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,220
And it was,
um,

160
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:24,730
one of these things that I think
it really held me back and I knew,

161
00:10:24,731 --> 00:10:28,750
I knew actually it was holding me back.
Um,

162
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:34,560
the strange part though was my mom was
recently talking to me about this in a

163
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:40,480
few years prior to that experience where
I'm in junior high, my, I'm on stage.

164
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:45,950
I had actually done this
other thing, which was, um,

165
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,830
we had this summer school program where I,
uh,

166
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:53,120
I would go to local community college.

167
00:10:53,121 --> 00:10:56,660
It was foothill college and all
these schools around the area.

168
00:10:56,661 --> 00:10:58,450
And when they let out for summer,
uh,

169
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:02,680
the students would go to this community
college to take math classes and writing

170
00:11:02,681 --> 00:11:03,870
classes and whatnot.

171
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:08,290
So a lot of elementary school students
to high school students would be at

172
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:12,160
Foothill College. And,
um, and so my mom said,

173
00:11:12,161 --> 00:11:16,420
you have to pick two classes.
And one class was a math class obviously.

174
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,130
Um, and she said you could pick
your second class. And, uh,

175
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:26,160
my brother picked a normal junior high
school writing class and I was in fifth

176
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:29,890
grade at the time,
so 10 years old.

177
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:35,460
And I picked a negotiations class and
it was not in the summer school program.

178
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:42,110
It was an adult class. Why
did you pick that? And um,

179
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:46,480
I picked it because I remember
the book was getting to yes.

180
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:51,400
And my mom looked at me and she said,
why did you pick this class?

181
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:55,270
And I said, it's because they're
teaching you how to get to. Yeah.

182
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,760
And I want to know how to get to yes.

183
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,460
And I have this incredible experience,
this Co,

184
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:07,600
this community college of
having, um, a class with,

185
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:12,630
I imagine they were probably 30 to 50
year old adults taking this class and they

186
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:19,120
were probably the most patient,
wonderful people. And you know,

187
00:12:19,121 --> 00:12:20,620
we had this,
uh,

188
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:25,900
this experience where you had certain
supplies that you were given on pieces of

189
00:12:25,901 --> 00:12:27,460
paper and then you had to negotiate,

190
00:12:27,461 --> 00:12:32,350
you're on Mars and you had to negotiate
supply lines and whatnot and create a

191
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:34,280
real society.
Um,

192
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:40,020
in the simulation they're taking seriously
a 10 year old kid who's negotiating

193
00:12:40,651 --> 00:12:43,350
for supplies.
And I,

194
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:48,210
I remember taking that
experience and feeling like,

195
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:51,870
you know,
I was taken seriously in that environment,

196
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:54,450
but it was a great experience
because it was a small class,

197
00:12:54,451 --> 00:12:55,950
it was like 20 people.

198
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,880
And in that setting I
felt okay speaking up,

199
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,050
but then on stage I didn't still and,

200
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,430
and so it was sort of these small steps
that felt like I was getting closer and

201
00:13:08,431 --> 00:13:12,840
closer to realizing, oh, I need
to actually be able to speak up.

202
00:13:12,841 --> 00:13:16,320
I need to be able to say things
in front of a large audience.

203
00:13:16,321 --> 00:13:19,830
And so there was this
desire to face my fears.

204
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:22,510
What was the next step after that?

205
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:26,470
How did you go about facing
the fear of speaking on stage?

206
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:28,190
So in,

207
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:33,190
in high school I get to high school and
as every high school freshmen is doing,

208
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:37,160
they're looking for different
activities to, to participate in.

209
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:42,460
And I decided to dive into a speech
and debate and speech and debate.

210
00:13:42,861 --> 00:13:47,720
At this time at Palo Alto high
school was not a very big activity.

211
00:13:47,721 --> 00:13:50,360
There were probably about
20 students on the team.

212
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:54,830
And uh, I, I found that I,

213
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:59,850
I really enjoyed it and it was a
really great group of students,

214
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,950
um, and then not only from
Palo Alto high school,

215
00:14:03,951 --> 00:14:05,810
but from the local community.

216
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,320
And I just fell in love with the idea
that you could really seriously get up in

217
00:14:13,951 --> 00:14:15,900
front of an audience and,

218
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:20,700
and talk about really important
issues even as a high school student.

219
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,890
And so,
uh,

220
00:14:22,891 --> 00:14:26,670
I dove into that activity and
it was frankly terrible at it.

221
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I think freshman, sophomore year,
I didn't win any tournaments,

222
00:14:32,001 --> 00:14:35,330
didn't even come close. Uh, and that was,

223
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,960
that was sort of the way though
I decided I could face that fear.

224
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:44,520
What did you, what kept you going? I
mean, there's the, the answer that,

225
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,250
or perhaps potential answer
you gave just a moment ago,

226
00:14:47,251 --> 00:14:51,090
which is you really enjoyed it and you
loved it, but what did you love about it?

227
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,440
What,
what did you enjoy so much?

228
00:14:54,441 --> 00:14:58,700
They were able to persist through
failures over those first two years.

229
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,420
The first thing is just the people.
Yeah.

230
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:07,100
I reflect actually on the people that
I met in speech and debate and they're

231
00:15:07,101 --> 00:15:11,600
doing incredible things. We
have just in my, my year or low,

232
00:15:11,601 --> 00:15:16,450
not in my team, but in my local
community, uh, professors,

233
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,120
you know,

234
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,120
one's at Harvard and government ones
and Philosophy University of Colorado,

235
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,050
a one woman is now, um, on,

236
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:31,600
on the the morning show on NPR.
Um,

237
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,830
we have several venture capitalists.

238
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:37,910
It was just a really interesting
group of people, um, all in,

239
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,750
all in the same age group,
uh,

240
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:44,900
who wanted to talk about
really interesting things. Um,

241
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:50,050
I also found that the actual
activity itself was something,

242
00:15:51,531 --> 00:15:54,980
it challenged me in a way that
I hadn't been challenged before.

243
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:59,990
So I was really good at math and science
and those things really came naturally

244
00:15:59,991 --> 00:16:00,824
to me.

245
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:05,870
But getting up on stage and speaking was
not something that was natural to me.

246
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:11,590
But the piece that I did love that
came very naturally was competition.

247
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,960
And I'm,
I've always been this way.

248
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:20,530
No, I'm just checking.
Yeah, I can agree with that.

249
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:24,120
Right. I love, I love competition. You,

250
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:28,650
you put in points on
anything and I want more.

251
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:32,700
I want to, I want more
than the next person. And,

252
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:38,030
and I remember the coaches that
we had, we, we didn't have, um,

253
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:41,550
teachers at our school
who were able to coach.

254
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:45,930
And so we had to go across the street
to Stanford and find students who are

255
00:16:45,931 --> 00:16:49,860
willing to coach. And these,
these kids were, you know,

256
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:52,020
18 to 21 years old.

257
00:16:52,021 --> 00:16:56,100
So they would pump us up by saying,
Hey,

258
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:01,400
if phew can get someone to
cry in cross examination,

259
00:17:01,551 --> 00:17:04,730
I'll buy you a slice of
pizza. And so, you know,

260
00:17:04,731 --> 00:17:09,580
things like that were
extraordinarily motivating you,

261
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:14,900
like logic and arguments
could get you a step further.

262
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:19,640
It was just something that even though
I wasn't good at it at the time,

263
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:24,350
I just loved it. And I felt like if
I could just do one more tournament,

264
00:17:24,351 --> 00:17:28,770
I become even better at it. And you
would see that. Right. And so that's,

265
00:17:28,771 --> 00:17:29,990
that's the thing that I love.

266
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,730
So do you have any memory of,
this seems like a very,

267
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:39,300
very specific example that you
gave the crying in the pizza.

268
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,470
Did that actually happen?

269
00:17:41,471 --> 00:17:45,190
Did you succeed at making someone crying
cross examination for a slice of pizza

270
00:17:45,191 --> 00:17:48,360
or is it, was that just
something that can, can you

271
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,280
please describe that?
Yeah,

272
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:56,560
I feel like I'm not succeeding and my
desire to humanize me and make myself seem

273
00:17:56,561 --> 00:17:58,360
like a less of a dragon lady but

274
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:03,210
there, but this, I want to hit
here, I want to hear this story.

275
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,311
Several stories.

276
00:18:06,311 --> 00:18:11,311
So there were points in time or I
remember people would cry in the,

277
00:18:11,751 --> 00:18:15,920
they would crumble in the middle of
cross examination and run out of the room

278
00:18:15,921 --> 00:18:16,754
crying.

279
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:22,180
And my coach would see that and proudly
bring me a slice of pizza after this

280
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:26,840
happened multiple times. This wasn't
a single tournament. It was an,

281
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,320
and there were moments where I got,

282
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,740
they had courtesy points too.
So it wasn't just about winning.

283
00:18:33,741 --> 00:18:37,910
It was also whether you were
courteous during that. And there were,

284
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:41,300
there were rounds where I
got zero courtesy points and,

285
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,290
and my coaches,
you know,

286
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:48,980
they would say they would ask why we
got zero courtesy points just to really

287
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,410
understand if we were just being mean.

288
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:54,970
But a lot of times it was just
because we were, you know,

289
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:59,980
and I was particularly tenacious
in cross examination and,

290
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:04,370
and even at the point where I had the
person stumped, I would just keep going.

291
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:09,050
I would keep going, keep going
at it. Um, and so it was,

292
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:11,300
I remember at least,
you know,

293
00:19:11,301 --> 00:19:15,580
four or five occasions where
where someone cried and,

294
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:17,690
and left the room before the round

295
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:18,900
it was over.
So this,

296
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:23,870
this was like the Cobra Kai
of debating the bad team.

297
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:31,040
My, uh, my, my six year old at one
point right before kindergarten said,

298
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:35,390
hey mama,
I can make people cry just with my words.

299
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:39,500
Say it was like a really proud
moment for me. And then I had to,

300
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:42,360
I had to course correct and, and, and talk

301
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:46,940
to him about that. But no,

302
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,610
for someone knew who it was,

303
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:54,700
is wondering what I omitted from
the bio that I had in front of me.

304
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:59,760
You had two years of not doing well.

305
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,040
And then in the bio we have,

306
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:05,670
she placed first in the
National Tournament of champions
and second in the state

307
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:08,280
of California in high school.
And it goes on and I'll,

308
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:09,141
I'll mention one more thing.

309
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:12,510
And it was part of a five person team
at Yale that competed in the Robo Cup

310
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:14,700
competition in Paris, France. All
right, but let's focus on the debating.

311
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,170
So how did you go from

312
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:22,670
sort of miss flub with not succeeding
and debating to getting good at debating?

313
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:25,701
Yeah,

314
00:20:25,701 --> 00:20:30,380
this is where I think
it's the love of the game.

315
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:31,550
Has To,

316
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:34,870
were your parents supportive
through all of these, the,

317
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:36,580
these early trials and tribulations?

318
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,680
No. So you have to, you
have to remember, you know,

319
00:20:39,681 --> 00:20:43,430
I come from very traditional Japanese
parents who really want me to get into a

320
00:20:43,431 --> 00:20:44,660
great university.

321
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:50,230
And my mom at one right after sophomore
year looks at my record and my parents

322
00:20:51,221 --> 00:20:52,720
were incredibly supportive.

323
00:20:52,721 --> 00:20:56,950
They would go and judge these
tournaments every single weekend,

324
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:02,350
spent so much time doing it,
driving us all over the state. And,

325
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:07,810
and my, my parents pulled me aside and
said, you know, this isn't working.

326
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:12,840
You have a losing record in this activity
that you're doing and you appear to be

327
00:21:14,321 --> 00:21:17,290
doubling down on your
time with respect to this.

328
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:21,280
And if you want to get into
a good college, you have to,

329
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:25,180
you have to perform well in whatever
you're doing. You know, just,

330
00:21:25,181 --> 00:21:27,850
it's not just about effort,
you have to have results.

331
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:31,930
And I remember my mom said to me,

332
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:37,360
I've heard fencing is a great way
to get into an ivy league college.

333
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:43,040
And I remember looking at
her and I was like, how,

334
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,340
how is it possible that she's my mother?

335
00:21:45,341 --> 00:21:50,341
She clearly does not know anything
about my athletic abilities if she's

336
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:55,090
suggesting that I move into
fencing at this moment. Um,

337
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:59,650
and so I said to them,
point taken,

338
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:04,190
give me the summer and I'm going to,

339
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,830
to just work on it. I'm going to, and
this was back before the Internet,

340
00:22:08,831 --> 00:22:10,510
so I working on it men,

341
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:15,540
I was at Stanford Green Library reading
philosophy books and reading articles

342
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,650
about the,
I think they have 12 topics,

343
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:25,510
12 possible topics that they're
going to pull from for the next year.

344
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:29,860
And I just studied those topics.

345
00:22:29,861 --> 00:22:33,760
I lived in the library and then I,
um,

346
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:37,630
emerged that year to start competing.

347
00:22:37,631 --> 00:22:40,000
And when they announced that first topic,

348
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:45,510
I knew that topic cold and then I
could write my cases really quickly.

349
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:51,830
I had already done all this research
and I remember going into my very,

350
00:22:53,351 --> 00:22:57,070
very first round, uh, and,

351
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,230
and had this deal with my parents.

352
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:03,880
If I didn't win one of my first
two tournaments or at least place,

353
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:05,080
then I would quit.

354
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:11,430
And I have this distinct impression
walking into my very first round of debate

355
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:17,790
that fall and feeling as I looked across
at my opponent that there was no way

356
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:24,580
that they could have out prepared me.

357
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:30,300
And so I knew that whatever they said
I would have five arguments against.

358
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:38,340
And it was this incredible knowledge
that that it's not that you can be lucky

359
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,720
and turn your luck around,
you actually make your own luck.

360
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:49,380
And for me that was a profound lesson
because I placed in that tournament and I

361
00:23:50,241 --> 00:23:53,150
placed in the next tournament
and it was like that.

362
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,890
It just never stopped after that.

363
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:59,630
And I had a losing record all
through my freshmen sophomore year.

364
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:04,070
And it's like I turned it around
junior year very suddenly.

365
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:09,460
And the main difference was that I
was willing to outwork and outdo every

366
00:24:09,471 --> 00:24:11,390
competitor who walked
in through that door.

367
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:17,130
For people who don't know the format.

368
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:17,851
And I'll be honest,

369
00:24:17,851 --> 00:24:21,330
I've been surrounded by it and not
surrounded by but certainly in the same

370
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:24,900
universities and so on
where debate teams existed.

371
00:24:24,901 --> 00:24:29,901
But I've never seen a
debate competition what,

372
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:32,160
what is,
what is the format?

373
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,840
So it's, it's a bunch of
nerdy kids dressed in suits,

374
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:41,190
holding briefcases and
then maybe that's changed,

375
00:24:41,191 --> 00:24:42,630
but that's what it was back then.

376
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:48,260
And then you have a resolution
that's been announced nationwide.

377
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:54,920
And that resolution is generally
has some philosophical elements to,

378
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,150
this is also Lincoln Douglas
style of debate. And you have,

379
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:05,160
um, so, so it's one
person against one person.

380
00:25:05,161 --> 00:25:10,161
So it's individual and it's value
based and so you're really debating

381
00:25:11,161 --> 00:25:13,500
philosophy. So, um,

382
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:17,460
an example of one debate that we did,

383
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:22,490
the principle of majority rule ought
to be valued above the principle of

384
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:27,771
minority rights or resolved that
education is a privilege and not a right.

385
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:34,560
So, so all of these debates
are really surrounding,

386
00:25:34,561 --> 00:25:36,630
not a specific policy,

387
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,220
but it has some application in the real
world and what you're trying to debate

388
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:46,250
is a philosophical underpinning
behind that statement.

389
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:52,010
And what I loved about debate was you
are actually forced to debate both sides.

390
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:57,780
So you had to have cases ready for
both the affirmative and the negative.

391
00:25:57,781 --> 00:26:02,781
So pro the resolution and against
the resolution and the format is the

392
00:26:03,331 --> 00:26:08,130
affirmative goes up and talks about
this resolution and says all the reasons

393
00:26:08,131 --> 00:26:09,690
that that they support it.

394
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:15,270
And then there's a short cross
examination where the negative then cross

395
00:26:15,271 --> 00:26:18,420
examines the affirmative,
asks questions of the affirmative.

396
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:24,020
Then the negative gets up and talks about
all the reasons that they're against

397
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,960
the resolution and then goes point by
point against all of the arguments that

398
00:26:30,931 --> 00:26:33,690
the affirmative made and
talks about why they're wrong.

399
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:37,380
And then there's another cross
examination of the affirmative against the

400
00:26:37,381 --> 00:26:41,280
negative and then the
affirmative gets up for rebuttal.

401
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:43,200
Negative gets up for a rebuttal.

402
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:48,470
And then the affirmative Dez closing
arguments sort of shorter and shorter

403
00:26:48,871 --> 00:26:50,490
speeches towards the end.

404
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:56,870
How is the outcome determined?
What are the, the parameters?

405
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:00,260
Yeah. So, so it really
depends on the, yeah,

406
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,250
aside from courtesy,

407
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:05,620
courtesy points, it's
all about courtesy. Um,

408
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,630
there's two different types of tournaments
actually when, when I was debating,

409
00:27:10,631 --> 00:27:15,360
one was where you had parent judges
and that I would say really the,

410
00:27:15,361 --> 00:27:18,290
the style of speaking,
um,

411
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:22,980
your flare really would come into
play. Your sense of humor. It was,

412
00:27:22,981 --> 00:27:25,480
it really just a line by line arguments.

413
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:30,960
There was also a places where you would
go where college students were the

414
00:27:31,301 --> 00:27:35,590
judges or experienced
coaches where the judges,

415
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:40,890
and that's where really the line by line
logic becomes much more important than

416
00:27:41,771 --> 00:27:44,620
just the style of your debate.
Um,

417
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:48,490
so it really depends on your audience and
you had to read the audience correctly.

418
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:51,880
And did they just then say,

419
00:27:51,881 --> 00:27:56,881
I I choose a or B or do they have to rank
like the sort of Olympic style one to

420
00:27:58,601 --> 00:28:00,070
10 in some fashion?

421
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,990
So you only have two debaters that you're,

422
00:28:02,991 --> 00:28:06,350
you're judging and you
vote for one of them. And,

423
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:11,150
and in some of the rounds you have just
a single judge. And then in another,

424
00:28:11,151 --> 00:28:14,640
Anne, in the, the breakout
rounds and semifinals you,

425
00:28:14,641 --> 00:28:16,700
you might have a panel of judges

426
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:23,420
and they can't confer. They're just
sort of voting individually on who wins.

427
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,180
So you,

428
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:31,180
you may be at a point now with debate
and argument that you've reached the,

429
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:33,860
the,
uh,

430
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:38,390
it's an unconscious competency phase
in the sense that in skill acquisition,

431
00:28:38,391 --> 00:28:42,710
one framework that one could use to think
about skill acquisition as you go from

432
00:28:42,711 --> 00:28:46,340
unconscious incompetence
to conscious incompetence,

433
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,880
to conscious competence,
then unconscious competence.

434
00:28:49,881 --> 00:28:52,880
So I don't know if this question is
going to be a good one, but I'll,

435
00:28:52,881 --> 00:28:53,571
I'll try it anyway.

436
00:28:53,571 --> 00:28:58,571
For people who want to get better at
debating and structuring arguments and so

437
00:29:00,681 --> 00:29:05,390
on, are there any books or
approaches or resources, anything,

438
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,980
exercises that you would suggest?

439
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:12,290
Well, getting to yes, I
thought was always really good.

440
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:17,560
Uh, I actually found
the philosophical, uh,

441
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:20,870
texts to be extraordinarily informative.

442
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:26,030
So anything where you have
that Socratic method in a book,

443
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,500
I found really,
uh,

444
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:33,890
a great way of learning how people
debate the greatest philosophers,

445
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:37,640
Aristotle and Socrates. Even, you know,

446
00:29:37,641 --> 00:29:42,580
when you get into more modern,
um, literature around justice,

447
00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:46,760
you have people like John Rawls writing,
uh,

448
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:50,530
that is actually a dialogue
and a real logical debate.

449
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:55,800
And I always found those examples to be
really great to read how people argue

450
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:03,340
philosophical constructs. Um,
you know, presidential debates,

451
00:30:03,341 --> 00:30:08,140
to be honest in politics aren't real
debates because it's two ships passing in

452
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:12,670
the night and you don't have
real conflict between people.

453
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:16,960
Um, I've also found like the
British parliamentary system,

454
00:30:16,961 --> 00:30:19,180
if you've ever had the
chance to see that on,

455
00:30:19,181 --> 00:30:21,620
I think sometimes it's on c span at,

456
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:26,640
that's actually an interesting
observation of a real world debate as well

457
00:30:27,071 --> 00:30:32,071
because they will actually
engage in dialogue around
policy and it's not just ad

458
00:30:32,801 --> 00:30:35,410
hominem attacks.
Um,

459
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:40,660
though I find those sort of real world
examples much more powerful than someone

460
00:30:40,661 --> 00:30:44,380
going sort of point by point
in teaching you how to debate.

461
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:49,540
Because I think the how is much more
around how do you engage in the idea?

462
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:54,900
How do you read and research both sides
of an argument and what do you believe

463
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:58,810
on both sides. Um, and so, you know,

464
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:03,900
one way to do that would actually do take
a fairly controversial topic and then

465
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,190
actually read,

466
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:11,610
read a lot of literature on both sides
of the argument and then understand where

467
00:31:12,281 --> 00:31:15,340
actually the conflict happens.
You know,

468
00:31:15,341 --> 00:31:19,630
are there definitions that
people don't agree on? Are there,

469
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:24,820
uh, are there nuances that, that
people haven't thought about? Uh,

470
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,590
are they,
are they real?

471
00:31:26,591 --> 00:31:30,760
Is there a real conflict or are they
two ships passing in the night? Um,

472
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:33,610
I think you could do that with
even the gun control debate,

473
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:37,660
or you could do that with immigration
or you could do that with abortion and

474
00:31:37,661 --> 00:31:41,890
really understand, uh, both sides
of an argument and that that's,

475
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:45,940
that's the way to engage in the
process of debate, I believe.

476
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:48,091
And if we're,

477
00:31:48,091 --> 00:31:53,091
if we're reflecting back on your Cobra
Kai training for slices of Pizza,

478
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:56,583
uh,

479
00:31:56,730 --> 00:32:01,020
I'd be really curious to know if
there are any particular approaches or

480
00:32:01,021 --> 00:32:06,021
questions or playbooks that you find
very useful in a heated argument.

481
00:32:12,001 --> 00:32:14,040
And I'll give you some
hypotheticals, right? Look, let's,

482
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:18,240
let's say that you are on stage at an
event and you are doing a Q and a with the

483
00:32:18,241 --> 00:32:22,020
audience and you have someone who ends
up being really hostile attacks you or it

484
00:32:22,021 --> 00:32:22,950
could be on someone on stage.

485
00:32:22,951 --> 00:32:25,290
You're just having a
contentious debate of some time.

486
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:28,590
I find it fascinating to see how people,

487
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:33,630
even with no real logical
advantage shutdown opponents,

488
00:32:33,631 --> 00:32:37,050
and I'm not saying that's you
in this case, but for instance,

489
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,020
whatever people may of our,
of our

490
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,970
dear current president
of the United States,

491
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:44,970
I do find it fascinating how
effective he has been at saying,

492
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,050
check your facts right? And, and,

493
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:53,190
and it just throws enough imbalance
into the dynamic where someone's like,

494
00:32:53,311 --> 00:32:53,821
wait a second,

495
00:32:53,821 --> 00:32:58,230
maybe I did miss one piece
of due diligence that
they're on their heels and it

496
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:02,190
opens up a window and creates sort of a,
uh,

497
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:07,260
an illusion of them being stymied that is
really advantageous. And I'm like, wow.

498
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:12,000
I mean it's, it's kind of
gross on one level, but it's
also kind of brilliant. Uh,

499
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:16,170
and I also have a lot of lawyers in my
family. And so one thing that they'll do,

500
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:21,150
uh, not to say they all love arguing,
but a lot of them do. And you'll,

501
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:25,560
you'll say something and they will go,
so let me just get this straight.

502
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:27,660
You're so I understand you're,

503
00:33:27,661 --> 00:33:31,770
you're saying that acts and they'll
kind of take your argument and like inch

504
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:36,390
inch it a little closer to absurdity,
but just subtly enough that you'll say,

505
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:40,290
yeah, that's about right. And they'll say,
okay, so really what you mean is x. Right?

506
00:33:40,291 --> 00:33:44,820
And they start to edge you over before
they even counter with an argument to

507
00:33:44,821 --> 00:33:49,080
make you contradict yourself
or kind of seem ridiculous.

508
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:53,340
And then it's, they just have
to kind of finish you off. Uh,

509
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:56,940
but I've never taken, I've
never taken debate. Uh, and,

510
00:33:56,950 --> 00:34:00,660
but I do find this really
practical and really interesting.

511
00:34:00,661 --> 00:34:05,130
So it's a long winded way of enjoying.
But yeah, like, so what are your,

512
00:34:05,131 --> 00:34:06,390
what are your thoughts on any of that?

513
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:12,790
It's funny, my, my husband
has said to me in the past,

514
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:16,480
and this is a lesson that I continue
to try to learn and relearn,

515
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:18,400
is that life is not a debate.

516
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:21,653
Right?

517
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:27,280
And, and you know what he's saying? And
it's funny, he was a debater as well,

518
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:29,950
um,
in college and in high school.

519
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:34,690
And we joke that I would still have beaten
him in high school if we had actually

520
00:34:34,691 --> 00:34:38,140
gone head to head.
But,

521
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:44,180
but I think it's a really important
point that life isn't about winning the

522
00:34:44,181 --> 00:34:47,060
argument. And, um,

523
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:50,630
and he's also said to me in
the past, you know, it's not,

524
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:52,340
it's not about being right.

525
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:56,210
And I think that's so true.

526
00:34:56,330 --> 00:35:01,330
And it's something that I'm always
trying to really practice in life.

527
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:08,240
And I think it's the debate or
in me, um, makes it really hard.

528
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:11,990
The,
the things that you're pointing out are,

529
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:18,160
what's important about it is that
people have a tendency to have an inner

530
00:35:18,381 --> 00:35:20,510
dialogue where they're there,
right?

531
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:24,860
And instead of really
listening to the other person,

532
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:30,620
they're coming up with the next
argument that proves that person wrong.

533
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:32,413
And so,

534
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:36,980
so if you go back to what I really loved
about debate and what I felt like I got

535
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:41,490
out of it, it was actually this ability
to see both sides of an argument,

536
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:47,070
to really delve into a topic
and understand why the,

537
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:52,110
the side that I actually naturally
believed could actually be flipped on its

538
00:35:52,111 --> 00:35:54,270
head.
And,

539
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:58,020
and that was a really
important skill to develop.

540
00:35:58,050 --> 00:36:02,730
And I think that was so much
more important to develop
then the skill to argue

541
00:36:02,731 --> 00:36:07,170
for my side.
Because I think in the world today,

542
00:36:07,171 --> 00:36:12,171
what we don't see enough of his empathy
for people you might even disagree with

543
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:19,340
and we get stock in our version
of truth and what is right.

544
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:24,330
And we aren't truth seekers anymore.
As a result,

545
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:29,010
we're truth of winners.
And true. Yeah, very true.

546
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,140
And that, that's the piece that
really makes me sad is that, you know,

547
00:36:34,141 --> 00:36:35,190
when people are like,
oh,

548
00:36:35,191 --> 00:36:40,191
this debate skill is so great to have
because now you can like Ram people with

549
00:36:40,981 --> 00:36:42,570
your ideas and,

550
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:47,460
and I've never seen a situation where
you shouted people down and convince them

551
00:36:47,461 --> 00:36:49,920
you are right.
And I,

552
00:36:49,921 --> 00:36:54,921
I've seen situations where by developing
true empathy for the other side,

553
00:36:56,100 --> 00:37:01,100
you actually create bridges and you create
commonality and you create situations

554
00:37:01,441 --> 00:37:04,920
where you can actually
work together. And, um,

555
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:09,150
and I think that's the piece I would
take away from my debate experience.

556
00:37:09,151 --> 00:37:14,151
I would say actually making the person
crying cross examination probably is not

557
00:37:14,641 --> 00:37:17,710
the skill that I should be using in real
life. Although maybe sometimes I do.

558
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:18,543
I do.

559
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:24,290
Just when you're teaching your years,
your son the black magic,

560
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:30,850
I, I should point out just so people
don't think I'm completely, uh,

561
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:34,650
uh, sort of drinking the Koolaid
of the blood lust of this,

562
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:39,210
of this potential sport. Although I
do find it very, very fascinating,

563
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:42,840
uh, as an insight into
some parts of human nature.

564
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:44,920
But the book you mentioned getting to yes,

565
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:49,050
just part a or a B byproduct of the
Harvard negotiation project as I recall.

566
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:53,010
Yeah.
Is Not a book about proving you're right,

567
00:37:53,011 --> 00:37:55,650
it's a book about getting outcomes.
Yes.

568
00:37:55,710 --> 00:38:00,710
And there is another book which I believe
was coauthored by one of the coauthors

569
00:38:01,561 --> 00:38:06,390
of getting to yes. Called getting
past no. Which I also really,

570
00:38:06,391 --> 00:38:11,090
really like and it is about a,

571
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:11,941
well both of these books,

572
00:38:11,941 --> 00:38:16,941
any book really under negotiation is
about achieving a very particular outcome

573
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:23,420
or arriving at a a desired result as
opposed to proving that you're right.

574
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:28,160
So I just want to underscore that,
uh,

575
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:33,220
B because there is a very real world
differences you already noted between say

576
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,580
debate and negotiation.

577
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:41,230
I mean the tool kits are very
similar perhaps in some respects,

578
00:38:41,231 --> 00:38:45,250
but in, in debate you're not
going to have to think about,

579
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:50,230
I wouldn't imagine something like the
Batna that they talk about in getting to,

580
00:38:50,231 --> 00:38:53,520
yes, you're your best alternative
to negotiated agreement, right?

581
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:56,410
Like do you like walk away
power or what your options are?

582
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:58,810
You don't necessarily have to
go through that thought process,

583
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,750
but when you step into the real world
and you're not just trying to prove that

584
00:39:01,751 --> 00:39:02,291
you're right,

585
00:39:02,291 --> 00:39:06,880
you're trying to get someone to concede
something and agree to a certain set of

586
00:39:06,881 --> 00:39:11,881
terms or price or whatever it might be
a or amicably trying to break up with

587
00:39:13,271 --> 00:39:17,200
someone or get together with someone or
have a divorce or whatever it might be.

588
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:21,200
Uh, you're really trying to
manifest some type of outcome, uh,

589
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:26,260
or damage control. It's really, really
different from being a truth winter.

590
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:30,730
Uh, and, um, the,

591
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:35,910
the worldclass term that I mentioned in
the intro and use used a little bit of

592
00:39:36,401 --> 00:39:41,401
foreshadowing saying that I suspected
it might come up a little bit later.

593
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:47,410
So in doing,
in doing homework for this conversation,

594
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:56,350
uh, I read, and I don't think this
is a misquote, but that your dad,

595
00:39:56,410 --> 00:40:01,410
even when I think you were going to be
photocopying and the Dean's office would

596
00:40:02,261 --> 00:40:04,360
remind you to be world class

597
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:08,140
and you would ask you if you
turn it into calculus assignment.

598
00:40:08,141 --> 00:40:11,820
Is that a worldclass effort? Yeah. Uh,

599
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:16,020
could you talk a little bit
more about this? And, uh, uh,

600
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:19,720
that's not that,
that wasn't my experience growing up.

601
00:40:19,721 --> 00:40:24,520
My parents certainly encouraged
me to do a good job, but, uh,

602
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:30,180
tell us a little bit more about your
dad in this particular case and how that

603
00:40:31,511 --> 00:40:32,344
was used.

604
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:37,440
Yeah, so my, my dad grew up in Tokyo,

605
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:40,860
um,
right at the tail end of World War II.

606
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:46,190
And so one of his earliest memories
actually is just a plane's coming across

607
00:40:46,831 --> 00:40:51,831
Tokyo and the fire bombs and
he escaped to the countryside.

608
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:56,170
Um, and, and then came back
to Tokyo for high school. Um,

609
00:40:56,190 --> 00:41:00,470
his father passed away when
he was in college and he, um,

610
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:04,260
literally tutored kids. Uh, one,

611
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:08,270
one guy was like the prime
minister's son until he,

612
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:12,430
so that he could make enough
cash to support his family. Uh,

613
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:15,320
he had three other siblings,
um,

614
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:19,140
and he was one of these
incredible academics.

615
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:24,200
And so he was at the top of his class
in one of the famous high schools in

616
00:41:24,601 --> 00:41:27,990
Tokyo. Went to Tokyo University. Um,

617
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:30,360
was also then went to Toshiba,

618
00:41:30,361 --> 00:41:34,640
which at the time was one of
these great companies to work for.

619
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:39,710
And then he ran into a friend
who, um, who told him he was,

620
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:43,610
he was also a friend who was one of the
top at his high school who said, hey,

621
00:41:43,611 --> 00:41:48,530
there's great opportunities in
America. And this, this person had,

622
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:49,310
uh,

623
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:54,310
gone off to Princeton and gotten his
phd and was at that time working in,

624
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:57,710
uh,

625
00:41:57,710 --> 00:42:02,610
one of the great labs and Ibm and
was also becoming a professor. And,

626
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:07,810
and my dad decided that he also wanted
to go to the u s and he was the eldest

627
00:42:08,661 --> 00:42:09,494
son.

628
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:14,830
And so having a mother who's
a widow and three siblings,

629
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:18,080
uh, he had to take care of them
until he had saved up enough.

630
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:21,920
All of his siblings were married
and his mom had the courage to say,

631
00:42:21,921 --> 00:42:23,240
you know what,
you can go,

632
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:28,100
you can go to the u s so this is sort
of the backdrop for who my dad is. He,

633
00:42:28,101 --> 00:42:32,060
he comes to the United States
without speaking very much English,

634
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:36,830
gets a phd in mechanical engineering,
Aerospace Engineering,

635
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:38,023
um,

636
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:43,360
and then is in a la ultimately as a
postdoc and an associate professor.

637
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:45,530
Um,

638
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:50,530
my mom comes to marry him and they are
the only family members living in the

639
00:42:53,601 --> 00:42:56,960
United States. So really no support. Um,

640
00:42:57,020 --> 00:43:01,100
so my dad eventually makes his
way out to NASA at Moffett field.

641
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:04,940
And, and I, my memories of him,

642
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:07,670
he was very engaged on the academics,

643
00:43:07,671 --> 00:43:12,080
but he would wake up at five in the
morning and go to work and he'd bring back

644
00:43:12,081 --> 00:43:16,040
reams of paper and would continue
working late into the night. Uh,

645
00:43:16,041 --> 00:43:17,420
he loved what he did.

646
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:23,080
And so when he turned to me on anything
I ever did from the time I was a small,

647
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:29,630
small child, um, I would
be writing something.

648
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:33,170
And if the handwriting wasn't
neat enough, he would say, hey,

649
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:37,790
is this world class? And I remember
thinking to myself, you know,

650
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,730
four or five year old,
yeah this is world class.

651
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:45,230
But he would always push.

652
00:43:45,231 --> 00:43:48,740
He would always say is this really,
you know,

653
00:43:48,741 --> 00:43:52,360
the best that a five year
old could ever do. Um,

654
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:57,290
and it was a constant message and the,
the story you're pointing to is one,

655
00:43:57,291 --> 00:44:00,370
when I was in, in college, um,

656
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:05,150
after living through a lifetime of
this is this world class question,

657
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:10,310
I had a um,
a moment where I was starting my,

658
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:14,060
my financial aid package included,
you know,

659
00:44:14,061 --> 00:44:17,720
10 hours of work study
and I the opportunity to,

660
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:20,540
to work in the office of
the dean of Engineering.

661
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:25,760
And what was really funny to me at the
time it since I'm leaving to go to my

662
00:44:25,761 --> 00:44:27,710
first day of work,

663
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:31,740
I called my parents and my dad
gets on the phone. He said,

664
00:44:31,741 --> 00:44:35,340
make sure you do a world costs job.
And I thought,

665
00:44:35,341 --> 00:44:39,780
my dad thought I was like really doing
something important in the office.

666
00:44:39,781 --> 00:44:43,530
And in fact I was just photocopying. And
I said to my dad, I'm photocopying and,

667
00:44:43,531 --> 00:44:46,740
and filing, there's no such thing as
world class there. And he said, well,

668
00:44:46,741 --> 00:44:47,970
I'd still think about it.

669
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:54,020
And so I get to the office and I am
actually just photocopying and filing.

670
00:44:54,121 --> 00:44:57,780
And I remember standing in front of
this photocopy machine with a stack of

671
00:44:57,781 --> 00:44:59,730
papers thinking to myself,

672
00:44:59,731 --> 00:45:03,300
what is world class in this situation?

673
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:08,960
And I decided it was really crisp copies
where you couldn't tell that it was a

674
00:45:10,501 --> 00:45:15,330
photocopy.
And so I remember really trying to make,

675
00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:16,120
you know,
the,

676
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:20,730
the color match and
everything was straight.

677
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:21,720
Um,

678
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:26,340
and I spent a lot of time on the
details and when I was filing things,

679
00:45:26,341 --> 00:45:29,190
I didn't just handwrite it.
I got a label writer and I'm,

680
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:33,090
I made sure it was printed out on labels.
Um,

681
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:37,020
and I really tried to do everything as,

682
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:39,060
as well as I possibly could.

683
00:45:39,061 --> 00:45:43,410
And I remember I was getting donuts
and I would like make sure I got the,

684
00:45:43,411 --> 00:45:47,040
the fresh doughnuts instead of the
ones that had been standing out.

685
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:51,630
I'm in the basket for awhile.
So every step of the way,

686
00:45:51,631 --> 00:45:56,631
it was what can I do to
make this experience for the
dean or for his executive

687
00:46:00,391 --> 00:46:02,760
assistant?
A delight moment.

688
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:07,920
And it was a real lesson for me because
it was a case of real ownership.

689
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:11,790
I felt so much ownership
of the job I was doing,

690
00:46:11,791 --> 00:46:13,920
even though from the outside,

691
00:46:13,921 --> 00:46:18,390
I think most people would have thought
it was just sort of a grunt job. Um,

692
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:22,890
and I think that's sort of,
again, when I come back to you,

693
00:46:22,891 --> 00:46:27,440
don't just get luck.
You, you make, can you,

694
00:46:27,441 --> 00:46:32,040
you create these opportunities
for yourself. Um, to me was,

695
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:35,280
was a real well real learning experience,

696
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:37,900
right? I mean, you're, you're,

697
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:43,110
you're looking at the potential
precursors of luck and trying to set the

698
00:46:43,111 --> 00:46:46,320
conditions, even though they
might not always produce luck.

699
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:50,010
The you can increase the
likelihood of it happening,

700
00:46:50,011 --> 00:46:55,011
which I think is a perfect segue to
a discussion about spring breaks.

701
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:01,620
Don't worry, this isn't going anywhere
tricky. This isn't going anywhere tricky.

702
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:06,180
Uh, this relates to shadowing. I'll just,

703
00:47:06,181 --> 00:47:09,240
that'll be my cue, which
might bring you back. So,

704
00:47:12,310 --> 00:47:15,830
all right, we're, we're
to lead into this. Uh,

705
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:20,950
you were giving a man a tour around Yale.
Yeah.

706
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:25,170
Who is this man? Why were you
giving them a tour? What happened?

707
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:29,980
And I actually don't know all the
detail. I just, I found two lines in

708
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,140
a past interview and I was like,
you know what?

709
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:34,330
I don't want to dig into this because
I don't, there's more to this story.

710
00:47:34,331 --> 00:47:35,190
I know it.
Uh,

711
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:37,410
yeah.
So I'm like,

712
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:43,430
I'm a junior at the time at
Yale and doing this office work.

713
00:47:44,430 --> 00:47:49,290
And the dean of engineering was
this, this, this older gentleman, um,

714
00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:54,210
Alan Brom blame.
And he had no idea who I was.

715
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,880
And I'd been working in this
office for I think two years,

716
00:47:57,270 --> 00:48:01,650
but he barely knew my name, but he
was, he was just like this great.

717
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:05,310
He'd worked under George Bush, Sr. He was,

718
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:09,140
he was a legendary physicist.
Um,

719
00:48:09,141 --> 00:48:12,690
and I really look up to this man.
And so one day he,

720
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:17,400
he pokes his head out of the office and
the executive assistant was out and he

721
00:48:17,401 --> 00:48:21,960
said, who are you? And I said,

722
00:48:21,990 --> 00:48:26,880
I'm an Mira. I'm your, I'm your student
assistant in this office. And he said, Oh,

723
00:48:26,881 --> 00:48:27,720
I've heard of you.

724
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:32,430
I need you to go and give this,

725
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:35,940
this friend of mine a tour of
the engineering facilities.

726
00:48:36,930 --> 00:48:40,500
And he's like, I know you'll do a good
job. Sarah has told me, you're great.

727
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:46,580
And so I take this gentlemen and I take
him on a fairly thorough tour of the

728
00:48:48,481 --> 00:48:53,130
engineering facilities and we just
had a great conversation and he,

729
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:57,270
it started off with, you know, where,
where are you from? And I said,

730
00:48:57,271 --> 00:48:59,190
I was from Palo Alto and it turns out,

731
00:48:59,191 --> 00:49:04,191
this is also from Palo Alto and we're
just sort of talking about Palo Alto and

732
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:06,780
in the buildings that are around us.

733
00:49:06,781 --> 00:49:11,730
And my growing up back in Palo Alto
and in the middle of it he said, hey,

734
00:49:11,731 --> 00:49:14,130
you know,
what are you doing for spring break?

735
00:49:14,550 --> 00:49:18,390
And it just so happened I was going
to go back home and visit my family.

736
00:49:19,170 --> 00:49:23,250
And he said, well,
that's great because, uh,

737
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:28,251
I'm wondering if you want to come and
shadow me and see what I do for a living.

738
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:33,900
And in my complete self centered,
uh,

739
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:37,980
moment of being a, you know, Jr, uh,

740
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:42,270
I hadn't asked this guy what he did
for a living. And so I said, well,

741
00:49:42,271 --> 00:49:47,160
what do you do for a living? And he
said, I'm the CEO of Hewlett Packard.

742
00:49:51,510 --> 00:49:56,490
And I remember thinking to myself,
I'm such a moron. And, and I said,

743
00:49:56,520 --> 00:50:01,520
I think that would be amazing to be
able to shadow you for a couple of weeks

744
00:50:01,621 --> 00:50:05,280
during spring break. And
so this man, Lou plot,

745
00:50:06,090 --> 00:50:06,923
um,

746
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:12,500
invites me to just shadow him
in 1997 and I am going around,

747
00:50:16,290 --> 00:50:19,370
literally, he, you know, he, he
didn't have a driver. He was, is,

748
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:24,150
this was really just the,
the Hewlett and Packard error of CEOs.

749
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:28,820
He drove himself around in a Ford
Focus. I remember this. We'd go,

750
00:50:28,850 --> 00:50:33,850
go to different meetings and he took
me around and one of the days actually,

751
00:50:34,370 --> 00:50:38,810
uh, Bill Gates came to make
an announcement about.net,

752
00:50:39,630 --> 00:50:41,780
um,
with Hewlett Packard.

753
00:50:42,350 --> 00:50:46,520
And so it was an incredible
event that happened.

754
00:50:46,521 --> 00:50:50,120
I got to sit back stage and see
everything that was happening.

755
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:55,690
And Lou Platt that invited
the photographer to come
in and actually take a

756
00:50:56,871 --> 00:51:01,610
picture of me talking to Lou and
I didn't really think about it.

757
00:51:01,610 --> 00:51:02,990
But after the fact,

758
00:51:02,991 --> 00:51:07,991
I get back to my dorm and Lou Platt
has sent me a thank you letter.

759
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:12,110
Thank thanks for coming to visit.

760
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:17,030
I thought you would enjoy
these photographs and there's
two photographs in there.

761
00:51:17,031 --> 00:51:21,560
I framed them in my office.
Now one is a picture of me sitting on a,

762
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:23,810
on a seat talking to Lou.

763
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:29,290
And then the second picture is bill
gates sitting exactly in that spot that I

764
00:51:29,931 --> 00:51:33,620
was sitting in talking to Lou Platt.

765
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:36,380
And you know,

766
00:51:36,381 --> 00:51:39,410
to me like mentorship means
so many different things.

767
00:51:39,411 --> 00:51:42,170
I've had so many different
examples of mentors,

768
00:51:42,171 --> 00:51:46,660
but to a junior in college who,

769
00:51:47,090 --> 00:51:50,370
who literally is a no body,
um,

770
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:55,190
he was such an incredible
example of mentorship.

771
00:51:55,520 --> 00:52:00,170
He never asked for my resume.
He never asked for my GPA.

772
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:04,580
He just sort of took this girl and said,
you know what,

773
00:52:04,610 --> 00:52:08,000
you have,
you have something and I,

774
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:11,600
I see it and I'm going to show
you something even greater.

775
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:16,340
And, um, to me that is such,

776
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:17,840
it was such a gift.

777
00:52:17,870 --> 00:52:22,870
It was so incredible because I hadn't
even thought about my own personal

778
00:52:22,971 --> 00:52:26,330
potential ever.
No one had ever described anything to me.

779
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:30,980
And I came back from that
with my mind completely blown.

780
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:36,520
I met Anne Livermore who was an executive
and I never seen a female executive in

781
00:52:36,951 --> 00:52:40,830
my entire life. And here's
someone who I could look at and,

782
00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:44,870
and see and I can see that
people around her respect her.

783
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,840
Um, it was just a, it's a,

784
00:52:47,841 --> 00:52:52,841
it's a life changing moment
and it comes from that first.

785
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:58,090
Okay. You know, comment from,
um, Dean Bromley who says,

786
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:01,470
I've heard of you, I heard
you do a great job. Um,

787
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:03,760
and that's where the
opportunities opened up.

788
00:53:04,630 --> 00:53:05,231
You're the,

789
00:53:05,231 --> 00:53:08,740
you're the woman responsible for my
fresh doughnuts and crisp photocopies.

790
00:53:08,741 --> 00:53:13,210
I've heard good things.
Exactly. It's a little things,

791
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:15,700
steps, filing labels. No,

792
00:53:15,990 --> 00:53:18,150
I should note where you don't
have to go too deep into this,

793
00:53:18,151 --> 00:53:23,151
but in a way you were perfectly
primed for doing a good job with your

794
00:53:24,031 --> 00:53:26,220
photocopying and labeling

795
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:31,800
after spending. Was it summers in
Kanazawa in the stationary store?

796
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:33,143
Am I making that up?

797
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:37,790
Yeah, no, my first job
was literally helping my,

798
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:42,820
my uncle and grandmother sell office
supplies in Kanisawa Japan at our store.

799
00:53:45,141 --> 00:53:45,974
Taichii doll

800
00:53:46,210 --> 00:53:50,170
pikey though. Oh Man.
[inaudible] is just such,

801
00:53:50,171 --> 00:53:52,630
I'd never been to Kanazawa for
those people who don't know.

802
00:53:52,631 --> 00:53:54,190
I used to live in Japan long time.

803
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:58,150
My first time out of the U S was a
year in Japan as an exchange student,

804
00:53:58,220 --> 00:53:59,230
which is a whole separate story,

805
00:53:59,231 --> 00:54:03,880
but never made it to Kennesaw until
a few years ago. It's gorgeous.

806
00:54:03,881 --> 00:54:07,100
And it's not that far away
from Tokyo at all, but such a,

807
00:54:07,101 --> 00:54:11,920
it's such a cute spot with,
uh, so much to offer. Uh,

808
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:14,410
what did you, I'm sorry, go ahead.

809
00:54:14,730 --> 00:54:15,270
Yeah,
it's,

810
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:20,270
it's actually incredible because it's
one of the few cities in Japan that was

811
00:54:20,311 --> 00:54:22,920
protected by historians.
The US,

812
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:27,950
it did not get bombed in World War II
because of some of the historic elements

813
00:54:28,711 --> 00:54:29,251
of the city.

814
00:54:29,251 --> 00:54:33,690
So it's almost like a smaller version
of Kyoto and it has a historic,

815
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:35,940
a Japanese garden called Kevin Oakwyn.

816
00:54:36,470 --> 00:54:40,010
Yeah, it was unbelievable. Unbelievable.

817
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:43,380
Believable. So it's,
it's like an eye summers.

818
00:54:43,381 --> 00:54:46,940
I would spend maybe like two
blocks away from Kevyn Aucoin. Wow.

819
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:49,830
So it was an incredible
set of summers. But yes, I,

820
00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:54,090
I used to man the cashier register at the,
the office supply store.

821
00:54:54,091 --> 00:54:58,950
So I know my pens and notebooks and
in stamps like nobody's business.

822
00:54:59,010 --> 00:55:01,650
Do you have any favorite Goto?
Don't worry,

823
00:55:01,651 --> 00:55:04,320
I'm not going to spend
too much time on this,

824
00:55:04,321 --> 00:55:09,270
but do you have any favorite notebooks
or pens or items of those types that you

825
00:55:09,271 --> 00:55:10,030
use today?

826
00:55:10,030 --> 00:55:13,780
Yeah, yeah, totally. So I'm on pens.

827
00:55:13,870 --> 00:55:15,770
I love the juice up.

828
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:20,530
Oh four how do you spell giussep juice up.
Oh,

829
00:55:20,531 --> 00:55:25,300
juice up. Okay. Yeah. Juice up oh
four. You can get them on Amazon.

830
00:55:25,301 --> 00:55:29,680
They're super thin pens. Oh four that's
at the 0.4 millimeter or something? Yeah.

831
00:55:29,710 --> 00:55:32,380
Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And then, um,

832
00:55:32,470 --> 00:55:37,180
for notebooks it's the Nuna,
it's n u u n a,

833
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,730
some European brand,
but,

834
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:44,260
but I like any notebook that
has the dot matrix on it.

835
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:48,810
Um, and those, the, the paper
quality is really great.

836
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:53,140
I see. Dot Matrix. Just not, it's not,
it's not like graph paper, but there is,

837
00:55:53,170 --> 00:55:56,650
there are perpendicular lines
that are dotted. Yes, yes.

838
00:55:58,090 --> 00:56:01,000
I'm very particular. They
could go on and on. Oh,

839
00:56:01,130 --> 00:56:04,210
it appeals to the dungeons
and dragons nerd in me.

840
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:08,860
Anything that resembles craft papers to
the juice, apoe four and the Nuna. Yeah,

841
00:56:08,890 --> 00:56:11,410
definitely. Anything European
sounding with the repeating val,

842
00:56:11,411 --> 00:56:15,490
I'll pay 40% more for, um, maybe, maybe,

843
00:56:15,550 --> 00:56:17,980
maybe 100%. Okay. Maybe a hundred percent.

844
00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:22,420
You mentioned that you have these
photographs in your office. I'm curious,

845
00:56:22,421 --> 00:56:25,870
you're sitting in your right now.
Yeah. All right. So what else,

846
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:27,310
I'm sure you have photographs,
you were family,

847
00:56:27,311 --> 00:56:30,730
but outside of kind of the usual suspects,
is there,

848
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:34,270
what are other items that you have in
your office that are important to you?

849
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:36,681
Uh,
let's see.

850
00:56:36,681 --> 00:56:41,681
I have the original lift pink mustache
that used to go in the front of the cars,

851
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:48,680
um, which I love. I have,

852
00:56:48,710 --> 00:56:53,710
I'm also a picture and a set of
laser etched metal plates that,

853
00:56:57,950 --> 00:57:01,310
uh, students gave to me, um,

854
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:06,110
that have sort of a word graph of
all of the words that they thought,

855
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:10,640
uh, they could, they, they ascribed to me

856
00:57:11,930 --> 00:57:13,620
students. Of what, what,

857
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:16,420
what was the context for these students
interacting with you and what are some

858
00:57:16,421 --> 00:57:17,254
of the words?

859
00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:21,740
Yeah, so I had, um, I teach at Stanford.

860
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:23,270
So after my phd,

861
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:27,140
what I realized was I loved
teaching more than anything else.

862
00:57:27,141 --> 00:57:30,500
And so I stayed in contact with,
uh,

863
00:57:30,501 --> 00:57:35,501
Tina Seelig and Tom Byers over at
Stanford who run the Stanford Technology

864
00:57:36,141 --> 00:57:37,340
ventures program.

865
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:41,990
And they've given me the opportunity
to teach a few different classes.

866
00:57:41,991 --> 00:57:46,850
But the one that I got these metal
plates and the photograph from was,

867
00:57:47,150 --> 00:57:47,690
uh,

868
00:57:47,690 --> 00:57:52,690
the class of 2013 may field fellows
group and they have words like a thunder

869
00:57:56,811 --> 00:58:01,790
lizard,
bad ass inspiring,

870
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:04,130
um,
mother.

871
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:09,500
So, um, you know,

872
00:58:09,501 --> 00:58:12,380
it's just really fun to see
sort of what words they thought.

873
00:58:13,130 --> 00:58:15,830
What were you, what were you
teaching these Mayfield fellows?

874
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:16,981
Uh,

875
00:58:16,981 --> 00:58:21,981
so we were teaching them basic concepts
behind leadership and entrepreneurship

876
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:29,900
and it's sort of the first exposure that
they get as juniors and seniors into

877
00:58:30,930 --> 00:58:33,810
really, you know, startup ecosystem.

878
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:37,860
What does venture capital
do within that ecosystem?

879
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:43,050
What are the tough choices that you have
to make as a leader within these types

880
00:58:43,051 --> 00:58:44,310
of organizations?

881
00:58:44,790 --> 00:58:48,690
What does growth look like in
these types of organizations?

882
00:58:48,691 --> 00:58:53,310
So it's just sort of a startup one oh
one but what I love about it is it's only

883
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:56,820
12 students and it goes for nine months.
Wow.

884
00:58:56,910 --> 00:58:58,650
So if you get to be involved in it,

885
00:58:58,651 --> 00:59:02,610
you get to really know
some of the students.

886
00:59:02,611 --> 00:59:07,020
And I've been mentoring students and
sometimes teaching some of these classes

887
00:59:07,021 --> 00:59:12,021
since 2008 and you get this whole arc
of the career path of young people and,

888
00:59:17,910 --> 00:59:22,280
and I really love it. I think it's
just sort of you get, see, you know,

889
00:59:22,281 --> 00:59:27,281
students who start off as seniors
and then they start their career,

890
00:59:27,831 --> 00:59:32,810
they might go to Grad School, um,
then they go back and get a job.

891
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:35,780
Then they have, uh, they get married.

892
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:39,920
And then I think one is now
about to have a kid. Uh,

893
00:59:39,950 --> 00:59:43,580
so you just sort of see this whole arc.
Um,

894
00:59:43,790 --> 00:59:48,350
and it's just about 10 years, 20 years
behind where I was. And so I get,

895
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:53,270
I get to see this incredible progress
that the students make over time.

896
00:59:53,390 --> 00:59:54,950
So it's,
it's something that I love

897
00:59:55,640 --> 01:00:00,620
and Miraco Mother of Thunder Lizards,
Aka mother of dragons. We're gonna,

898
01:00:01,010 --> 01:00:02,300
we're gonna,
we're gonna,

899
01:00:02,330 --> 01:00:05,150
we're gonna come back to thunder lizard
because there's a whole lot wrapped

900
01:00:05,151 --> 01:00:09,860
around that. But, uh,
I'm going to try to keep,

901
01:00:09,861 --> 01:00:11,810
my brain's somewhat focused here.

902
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:15,850
Is there a reading list for that class or,
uh,

903
01:00:15,890 --> 01:00:20,890
do you recall anything that was on a
recommended or required reading list for

904
01:00:20,991 --> 01:00:21,824
that class?

905
01:00:22,130 --> 01:00:27,080
Yeah, so we actually teach a, I'm
starting a class today at Stanford,

906
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:31,670
um, for the new spring
quarter. And in this class,

907
01:00:31,671 --> 01:00:35,690
what we're teaching is what I
would call intelligent growth.

908
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:40,250
It's a little bit different than may
field fellows. Um, but my hypothesis,

909
01:00:40,251 --> 01:00:45,251
my belief is that just
like fake news in politics,

910
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:50,480
there's actually something that we would
call fake growth. And we've, we've,

911
01:00:51,330 --> 01:00:55,890
we've worshiped at the alter of
growth for about five to 10 years now.

912
01:00:56,280 --> 01:01:01,280
And what I've seen is that specifically
specifically within startups,

913
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:09,780
there's so much that we
see that it's fake and,

914
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:15,640
and no one has ascribed actual
adjectives to growth until now.

915
01:01:17,070 --> 01:01:22,070
And so the class that I'm teaching to
engineering students at Stanford is around

916
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:26,970
what is actually intelligent growth.

917
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:29,460
And so you asked about the reading for it.

918
01:01:29,461 --> 01:01:34,170
It's all around some of these
case studies that we've seen. Um,

919
01:01:34,230 --> 01:01:38,370
a great example of that
to me is Qualtrics.

920
01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:42,720
We're going to have Ryan Smith who is
the sea of Qualtrics come in and speak.

921
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:48,150
And I think he's a great example
because I think he was at $50 million in

922
01:01:48,151 --> 01:01:51,720
revenues before he raised a
dime of venture capital money.

923
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:53,520
And so as a result,

924
01:01:53,521 --> 01:01:58,521
he's going to own an incredible piece of
this company when it exits and it will.

925
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:04,650
Uh, and so I love the capital efficiency
with which he built his business.

926
01:02:05,190 --> 01:02:07,370
I also think, you know,
one of my companies,

927
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:12,380
Lyft is a great example of having
that kind of discipline early on.

928
01:02:13,530 --> 01:02:18,530
And not just not just wasting venture
capital dollars in the early days,

929
01:02:19,230 --> 01:02:21,300
they didn't have product market fit.

930
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:26,780
So they spent two and a half years
working on this platform called Zimride,

931
01:02:27,390 --> 01:02:30,970
knowing that they had to get
to density and writers. Um,

932
01:02:31,030 --> 01:02:32,400
and Zimride was just a,

933
01:02:32,401 --> 01:02:37,350
it was a platform where you could find
carpooling arrangements and it was being

934
01:02:37,351 --> 01:02:40,860
sold to universities and companies,

935
01:02:41,580 --> 01:02:45,720
but we couldn't get enough density to
get transactions really moving fast.

936
01:02:46,170 --> 01:02:49,350
And it was two and a half years
before they launched Lyft.

937
01:02:50,070 --> 01:02:54,390
And in the first six weeks you could start
to see that there was a real traction

938
01:02:54,391 --> 01:02:57,270
there.
And it was only after they,

939
01:02:57,271 --> 01:03:02,271
they knew what they were doing with Lyft
that they went and raised large round

940
01:03:02,821 --> 01:03:07,440
with founders fund and then
an even larger round with, um,

941
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:12,570
Andreessen Horowitz and, and
that, that story of really,

942
01:03:12,750 --> 01:03:16,380
really hacking value before you go out.

943
01:03:16,381 --> 01:03:20,520
And Hack growth is something
that I don't see often enough in,

944
01:03:20,580 --> 01:03:22,850
in silicon valley.
So it's something that I'm,

945
01:03:23,090 --> 01:03:26,610
I'm continuing to seek and
I love to see companies,

946
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:29,700
especially outside of Silicon
Valley, that, that do that.

947
01:03:29,701 --> 01:03:32,870
And that's when we come back
to hunting for thunder lizards.

948
01:03:32,930 --> 01:03:36,800
That's what I'm looking for.
When you mentioned the case studies,

949
01:03:36,801 --> 01:03:40,970
do you have written case studies
that you using it much like a,

950
01:03:40,971 --> 01:03:42,260
I don't know if Stanford uses these,

951
01:03:42,261 --> 01:03:44,810
but much like the Harvard
Business School case studies,

952
01:03:44,811 --> 01:03:48,050
which are these kind of three ring binder?
Yeah.

953
01:03:48,051 --> 01:03:51,500
A five to 10 page cases that
are published. You use those?

954
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:55,710
Yeah, we use, uh, so the,
the ones that we focused on,

955
01:03:55,711 --> 01:04:00,210
there's a Harvard business
case on flood gate,

956
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:05,100
uh, that you can purchase
off of the Harvard Business
Review website. All right.

957
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:05,740
So just

958
01:04:05,740 --> 01:04:09,070
so anyone can purchase these, you don't
have to be a student. And I, and I just,

959
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:12,610
yeah, I don't want to interrupt but keep
going because the format of these case

960
01:04:12,611 --> 01:04:14,470
studies is really interesting to me.

961
01:04:14,471 --> 01:04:18,340
In as an undergrad senior when I
took ed showers class in high tech

962
01:04:18,341 --> 01:04:20,950
entrepreneurship,
which is how I met Mike Maples Junior,

963
01:04:20,951 --> 01:04:24,500
who's going to be a recurring
character shortly. Uh,

964
01:04:24,940 --> 01:04:29,530
I remember how useful they were. So
that's, uh, that's the only interjection.

965
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:30,453
Sorry to interrupt.

966
01:04:30,780 --> 01:04:32,110
No, exactly. So we,

967
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:36,030
we use that case study for Qualtrics.

968
01:04:36,430 --> 01:04:40,650
There is one on flood gate, so if you
go to the Harvard Business Review Site,

969
01:04:40,651 --> 01:04:44,100
you can actually just search for flood
gate or Qualtrics and it'll come up in

970
01:04:44,101 --> 01:04:47,640
there somewhere between,
you know, five and $15.

971
01:04:47,650 --> 01:04:50,610
They're pretty easy to buy and download.
Um,

972
01:04:51,270 --> 01:04:54,570
but I think those two in
particular are quite valuable.

973
01:04:54,870 --> 01:04:57,990
We have then also,
uh,

974
01:04:58,020 --> 01:05:02,070
just people coming in and speaking about
some of the things that they've learned

975
01:05:02,071 --> 01:05:07,071
in how to grow that business from
zero to one and then one to ax and,

976
01:05:07,740 --> 01:05:09,220
uh, people like, uh,

977
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:14,300
Michael Siebel who is now a partner
at y Combinator but also was part of,

978
01:05:15,060 --> 01:05:18,940
uh, Justin TV. Um, and social cam.

979
01:05:19,150 --> 01:05:21,350
We have a Stephanie Schatz who,

980
01:05:21,351 --> 01:05:25,300
who was the fearless leader
on the sales side for Xamarin.

981
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:30,100
She had 18 straight quarters
of beating the stretch target.

982
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:34,770
Uh, so you can only imagine how
incredible she is as a sales leader,

983
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:39,310
taking a company from zero to
$50 million in revenues. Um,

984
01:05:39,610 --> 01:05:42,010
so we have a lot of
different types of people,

985
01:05:42,011 --> 01:05:47,011
whether they're CEOs or c Aros or venture
investors coming in to talk about the,

986
01:05:50,070 --> 01:05:53,250
the kinds of trade offs
they had to make and,

987
01:05:53,390 --> 01:05:57,970
and how they decipher growth,
uh, to make sure that they're,

988
01:05:57,971 --> 01:06:01,690
they have the real kind and not
just kind that they're buying.

989
01:06:02,630 --> 01:06:04,770
Right. It, just to elaborate on that,

990
01:06:04,771 --> 01:06:07,830
for people who may not be in the
startup world, if, if for instance,

991
01:06:07,831 --> 01:06:11,910
you're sitting in on an incubator,
a investor day,

992
01:06:11,911 --> 01:06:13,770
and you see 12,

993
01:06:13,771 --> 01:06:18,771
12 companies in a row that have 20%
month on month growth with very similar

994
01:06:19,021 --> 01:06:19,854
looking charts,

995
01:06:20,310 --> 01:06:25,310
there is some possibility that they
have been inflating or manufacturing the

996
01:06:25,321 --> 01:06:29,700
numbers with paid acquisition to raise
funding or do any number of things.

997
01:06:29,701 --> 01:06:32,280
And it's really easy to, uh, it's,

998
01:06:32,281 --> 01:06:36,720
it's relatively easy to spot once you
know the symptoms, but there are an end,

999
01:06:36,750 --> 01:06:40,440
then there are, I suppose, you know,
Richard Fiman would say the physicist,

1000
01:06:40,910 --> 01:06:44,340
you must be sure not to trick yourself
or fool yourself and you're the easiest

1001
01:06:44,341 --> 01:06:44,971
person to fool.

1002
01:06:44,971 --> 01:06:48,750
You can also get very caught up with
what you might consider vanity metrics.

1003
01:06:48,751 --> 01:06:52,590
But let me take a step back and
just ask. Well, before I ask people,

1004
01:06:52,591 --> 01:06:56,520
definitely take a look at the case
studies for both Harvard and if you search

1005
01:06:56,521 --> 01:06:59,640
Stanford GSB,
which is the business school case studies,

1006
01:06:59,641 --> 01:07:03,840
you'll also find a website with these uh,

1007
01:07:04,170 --> 01:07:06,120
profiles of companies
and not just companies,

1008
01:07:06,121 --> 01:07:11,121
but decisions they had to face generally
where you can determine for yourself

1009
01:07:11,371 --> 01:07:14,250
what you would do in a given situation.
Then read about what they did,

1010
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:15,450
whether it's Mongo DB,

1011
01:07:15,451 --> 01:07:18,600
I'm looking at this Stanford GSB
site in the case studies right now,

1012
01:07:18,601 --> 01:07:22,740
so nose and so on. Uh, how did you

1013
01:07:24,570 --> 01:07:25,920
go to investing?

1014
01:07:25,921 --> 01:07:30,420
How did you first be he become exposed
to save venture capital and what did you

1015
01:07:30,421 --> 01:07:33,630
think you were going to do in college
when you were in college junior year?

1016
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:36,330
What do you think? What did you expect
you're going to do when you grew up?

1017
01:07:38,150 --> 01:07:41,810
Yeah,
I actually had multiple different paths.

1018
01:07:41,811 --> 01:07:46,811
I started off when we were talking about
my brother describing this kid who knew

1019
01:07:46,851 --> 01:07:50,900
he wanted to work with cars or airplanes,
uh,

1020
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:53,300
from the get go.
And guess what he's doing right now,

1021
01:07:53,301 --> 01:07:57,470
he's in Germany working with
race cars. So, you know,

1022
01:07:58,100 --> 01:08:00,410
and I was the complete opposite.

1023
01:08:00,530 --> 01:08:04,490
I think when I was four I wanted to be
a farmer and then somewhere along the

1024
01:08:04,491 --> 01:08:08,900
lines I really wanted
to be a doctor and I,

1025
01:08:09,050 --> 01:08:13,190
I want it to be a doctor for
a fairly long period of time.

1026
01:08:13,250 --> 01:08:16,040
Where in you freshman year?

1027
01:08:16,041 --> 01:08:21,020
Summer I took organic chemistry.
It was in this premed track. Um,

1028
01:08:21,021 --> 01:08:22,130
I think sophomore year,

1029
01:08:22,131 --> 01:08:26,660
summer you take the m cats if you're
pretty sure you want to go to medical

1030
01:08:26,661 --> 01:08:27,494
school.

1031
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:32,680
And that summer I was with my best
friend who also really wanted to go to

1032
01:08:32,841 --> 01:08:37,220
medical school and she is right now,
uh,

1033
01:08:37,250 --> 01:08:42,170
studying leukemia. She's a
doctor, uh, at UCF. So she's,

1034
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:46,060
she's clearly gone down that
path and double down on it. Uh,

1035
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:49,850
but I remember going to study
for the mcats with her and I,

1036
01:08:50,060 --> 01:08:54,890
I turned to the side and I looked at
her and I had the sudden realization,

1037
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:59,780
which was that then, this is two days
before we're taking the amp cats.

1038
01:09:00,140 --> 01:09:04,820
I said, hey, Kathy, I hate hospitals.

1039
01:09:05,510 --> 01:09:09,210
Um, I don't like actually
being around sick people.

1040
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:14,280
I also don't love it when people
are always complaining to me.

1041
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:19,710
And, and I think that might get
in the way of me being a doctor.

1042
01:09:20,370 --> 01:09:24,270
And she looked at me like I was an alien.
And she said,

1043
01:09:24,271 --> 01:09:28,020
why are you saying this right now?
We're about to take me.

1044
01:09:28,021 --> 01:09:33,000
I'm cats and we need to go study
for it at Kaplan. And, but,

1045
01:09:33,030 --> 01:09:33,391
you know,

1046
01:09:33,391 --> 01:09:38,080
I was just constantly observing her and
she's just this incredible human being.

1047
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:42,900
And she continues to be. Um,
but this realization of wow,

1048
01:09:42,901 --> 01:09:47,901
like the actual job of being a Dr. May
not be something that I actually enjoy,

1049
01:09:48,900 --> 01:09:52,740
was really a hard realization when
you've been all in for this long.

1050
01:09:53,220 --> 01:09:58,170
And so, but it was, it was a
realization that I really had to face.

1051
01:09:58,200 --> 01:09:58,921
And I knew,

1052
01:09:58,921 --> 01:10:03,840
I knew my gut that I was doing it
because it was a really great path.

1053
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:07,500
It was a path where I knew
what the next step was.

1054
01:10:07,501 --> 01:10:11,040
I knew what next class I had to take,
I knew the next exam I had to take.

1055
01:10:11,041 --> 01:10:14,100
Then there was applications,
then there was school,

1056
01:10:14,101 --> 01:10:18,840
and then there was residency and
fellowship and it just felt like a really

1057
01:10:18,841 --> 01:10:20,730
predictable thing to do.

1058
01:10:21,030 --> 01:10:24,780
But the actual work at the end of the
day was not something that was going to

1059
01:10:24,781 --> 01:10:27,990
love or enjoy.
And that was really disturbing to me.

1060
01:10:28,860 --> 01:10:33,540
And so I really screeched
off of that path and I had,

1061
01:10:33,630 --> 01:10:37,710
and it was hard because I had actually
taken all of the requirements except for

1062
01:10:37,711 --> 01:10:42,711
biology and the premed requirements
did not actually overlap very much with

1063
01:10:43,651 --> 01:10:44,700
electrical engineering.

1064
01:10:44,701 --> 01:10:48,420
So I've taken a lot of extra
classes to make it a possibility,

1065
01:10:48,810 --> 01:10:53,810
but realize also it wasn't for me and
that's where I was sort of in this state

1066
01:10:54,091 --> 01:10:57,450
of not knowing what I wanted to be.
And that's okay

1067
01:10:57,790 --> 01:10:58,670
for one second.
Yeah.

1068
01:11:00,270 --> 01:11:03,340
What you just described illustrates a,

1069
01:11:04,540 --> 01:11:09,400
a degree of self awareness,
but also decision making that I think is,

1070
01:11:09,490 --> 01:11:14,490
is rather uncommon in the sense that I
know a lot of people who have gone on to

1071
01:11:14,491 --> 01:11:19,491
become doctors or lawyers or fill in
the blank that has a lot of prerequisite

1072
01:11:20,221 --> 01:11:25,221
training and schooling because of say
succumbing to this sunk cost fallacy.

1073
01:11:25,921 --> 01:11:30,420
Like, Ugh, God, I've put in so much time,
even though I have this intuitive feeling,

1074
01:11:30,421 --> 01:11:33,780
I'm not going to like it.
I really should do it.

1075
01:11:34,140 --> 01:11:39,140
And what was the conversation or the
background that allowed you to step off of

1076
01:11:44,041 --> 01:11:47,960
that path? And not to beat the
like Asian kid drum too hard, but,

1077
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:52,980
but let's be real. Right? I mean you're
also, I mean that's, that would be a very,

1078
01:11:53,710 --> 01:11:56,100
uh, admirable, well-respected,

1079
01:11:57,330 --> 01:12:01,470
happy to share at a dinner party with
friends type of path for your parents,

1080
01:12:01,471 --> 01:12:02,340
I would assume.

1081
01:12:03,530 --> 01:12:07,680
So all the more uncommon that
you would step off of that track.

1082
01:12:08,670 --> 01:12:12,510
So how has that, how has that the case,
why, why or why were you different?

1083
01:12:13,290 --> 01:12:17,960
So I think it goes back to actually
the moment in debate where I,

1084
01:12:18,210 --> 01:12:22,470
I, my mom is telling me, um, you should,

1085
01:12:22,620 --> 01:12:24,930
you should do fencing instead of debate.

1086
01:12:26,430 --> 01:12:31,430
There was this realization
of my parents really love me,

1087
01:12:32,220 --> 01:12:35,940
but they don't know me and they,
they don't actually,

1088
01:12:36,330 --> 01:12:41,330
no one really knows me in terms of my
capabilities and what I feel like I can

1089
01:12:41,791 --> 01:12:46,530
get done. No one knows that
better than I do. And, um,

1090
01:12:48,370 --> 01:12:49,031
and it was a,

1091
01:12:49,031 --> 01:12:54,031
it was an important lesson for me because
one other fact that I didn't mention

1092
01:12:54,910 --> 01:12:56,950
is that in as a kid,

1093
01:12:57,340 --> 01:13:01,420
there was no sign that I was
special except for, you know,

1094
01:13:01,430 --> 01:13:05,540
these weird characteristics where
I would go learn negotiations. Um,

1095
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:10,960
but I failed the Iq test multiple times
and the school district insisted I was

1096
01:13:13,581 --> 01:13:15,290
not gifted or talented.

1097
01:13:15,770 --> 01:13:20,600
My mom had to fight for me to be part
of this gifted and talented program.

1098
01:13:21,170 --> 01:13:24,050
Um,
as a two year old after I,

1099
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:28,100
I was a really hostile to
people who spoke English.

1100
01:13:28,370 --> 01:13:32,630
My Mom's stuck me in, tried to put
me into preschool to socialize me,

1101
01:13:32,990 --> 01:13:37,280
but I, um, ended up biting the
person who was interviewing me

1102
01:13:39,050 --> 01:13:43,970
for, for a preschool slot and
they put me in special education.

1103
01:13:44,660 --> 01:13:47,060
And, um, and I was,

1104
01:13:47,150 --> 01:13:51,560
I was one of those kids who got picked
up in a short yellow bus from our house

1105
01:13:51,590 --> 01:13:55,700
and take into a state run program for,
for,

1106
01:13:55,730 --> 01:14:00,410
for special children. And,
and I think for a long time,

1107
01:14:00,411 --> 01:14:03,770
my mom wasn't really sure what I was,

1108
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:08,870
but she just decided to be all in on
the fact that I was gifted and talented,

1109
01:14:09,170 --> 01:14:12,430
even if I wasn't.
And she really worried that I was,

1110
01:14:12,490 --> 01:14:16,390
I was one of these special
children. And, and,

1111
01:14:16,420 --> 01:14:21,420
and so I had sort of an environment around
me way before Yale where I knew what

1112
01:14:26,921 --> 01:14:30,970
I was capable of, even if the
test scores showed that I wasn't.

1113
01:14:31,570 --> 01:14:35,910
Hmm. And I knew that I
knew what I was capable of,

1114
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:38,940
even if my parents didn't see it in me.

1115
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:41,640
And I think there's sort of this,

1116
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:44,760
this moment in time that
people need to have where,

1117
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:50,300
where you realize that there's
no test for human potential,

1118
01:14:51,961 --> 01:14:55,350
there's no recognition for that.

1119
01:14:55,590 --> 01:14:59,280
It's something that you have
to find inside of yourself.

1120
01:14:59,790 --> 01:15:02,640
And I think for me, you know, that,

1121
01:15:02,641 --> 01:15:06,600
that one of those tests was
actually going back to, am I,

1122
01:15:06,601 --> 01:15:08,400
am I going to be a great doctor?

1123
01:15:09,030 --> 01:15:12,030
And if I revisit this question
that my dad had always asked me,

1124
01:15:12,060 --> 01:15:13,680
can you be world class?

1125
01:15:14,070 --> 01:15:18,030
I knew I couldn't cause I looked at
Kathy and she was going to be world class

1126
01:15:18,390 --> 01:15:19,350
cause she loved,

1127
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:24,800
she loved helping people and she
loved helping people from that kind of

1128
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:28,950
caretaking perspective,

1129
01:15:29,370 --> 01:15:32,820
which is not where I was
going to be world class.

1130
01:15:33,180 --> 01:15:38,040
But I felt like there was something in
me where I could be great at something

1131
01:15:38,250 --> 01:15:39,360
that just wasn't it.

1132
01:15:41,430 --> 01:15:44,880
And how did you have the, you've all
this technical training by this point?

1133
01:15:44,881 --> 01:15:49,210
Many have the chemistry, but you certainly
also have the, uh, let's see here.

1134
01:15:49,270 --> 01:15:52,360
At that point, the electrical
engineering probably. Yeah. Uh,

1135
01:15:53,230 --> 01:15:56,970
how does finance and
investing or startups,

1136
01:15:56,980 --> 01:15:59,080
I don't know which came
first enter the picture?

1137
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:02,840
Yes.
So having grown up in Palo Alto,

1138
01:16:02,841 --> 01:16:06,720
I was actually exposed to a lot of
startups as a, even as a kid. My,

1139
01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:10,820
I used to Babysit for a
serial entrepreneur, um,

1140
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:13,190
and he was always tinkering
around in his garage.

1141
01:16:13,191 --> 01:16:18,140
And I remember thinking to myself, oh,
he, he works for himself, which is very,

1142
01:16:18,141 --> 01:16:23,060
very cool. I also, I'm
on my debate team. Um,

1143
01:16:23,180 --> 01:16:28,180
was Lisa Brennan jobs who I didn't really
realize she was the daughter of Steve

1144
01:16:29,660 --> 01:16:34,580
Jobs until I was in her house. Um, and
we were, we were talking about debate.

1145
01:16:34,581 --> 01:16:35,090
I was,

1146
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:39,650
I was a senior at the time and I was
helping her through learning the ropes of

1147
01:16:39,651 --> 01:16:42,680
speech and debate. And Steve jobs
sort of appeared out of nowhere.

1148
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:47,260
And I remember thinking to myself, what
a Steve Jobs doing in this house? Um,

1149
01:16:48,530 --> 01:16:52,040
and so, you know, it was just
sort of, it was all around and,

1150
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:57,260
and so venture capital was something that
actually a friend of mine had brought

1151
01:16:57,261 --> 01:17:01,340
up when I was still struggling with
this notion of what should I be.

1152
01:17:01,670 --> 01:17:05,840
And he was a real finance guy
and he said, you know, you are,

1153
01:17:06,140 --> 01:17:10,460
you're really good at technology and
you're now in business because of this

1154
01:17:10,461 --> 01:17:14,090
exposure to loop plot. You know, have
you ever thought of venture capital?

1155
01:17:14,510 --> 01:17:18,980
And I remember kind of reading about it
and having heard a little bit about it

1156
01:17:18,981 --> 01:17:23,870
growing up, um, looking into it and
realizing, oh, you have like all,

1157
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:26,180
all this work experience you need to have.

1158
01:17:26,630 --> 01:17:31,250
I talked to a couple of former Yalies
who were venture capitalist and,

1159
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:36,020
and sort of had that in my,
in the back of my head. Um,

1160
01:17:36,021 --> 01:17:37,040
and so,
you know,

1161
01:17:37,041 --> 01:17:42,041
I went off to work at Mckinsey as a
consultant for three years and then in the

1162
01:17:43,581 --> 01:17:45,800
process of trying to
figure out what to do next,

1163
01:17:46,220 --> 01:17:50,090
I met a venture capitalist by
the name of Ted Denture Smith.

1164
01:17:50,750 --> 01:17:53,390
And in that interview with him,

1165
01:17:54,110 --> 01:17:57,560
we spoke about not about technology,

1166
01:17:57,561 --> 01:18:00,770
not about the research I'd
done or my work experience,

1167
01:18:00,771 --> 01:18:05,380
but he wanted to know what books I
was reading. He wanted to know, uh,

1168
01:18:05,470 --> 01:18:07,580
about the music that I loved.

1169
01:18:07,940 --> 01:18:12,620
And in that period I was really
into modern American literature.

1170
01:18:12,621 --> 01:18:16,730
So I was really into El
Doctorow. And uh, there,

1171
01:18:16,820 --> 01:18:21,290
there are a few books that
I just absolutely loved and
we talked about that for

1172
01:18:21,291 --> 01:18:25,760
a little while. And then when we
turned to music, I've played piano,

1173
01:18:25,761 --> 01:18:29,990
classical piano since I was four and he,

1174
01:18:30,380 --> 01:18:31,830
he and I talked about the,

1175
01:18:31,831 --> 01:18:36,831
the classical musicians that I really
loved and he happened to be an English lit

1176
01:18:37,281 --> 01:18:40,250
major along with being a physics major.
So he,

1177
01:18:40,430 --> 01:18:44,060
he loved books as much as I did,
maybe even more.

1178
01:18:44,061 --> 01:18:46,130
And then he was an opera nut.

1179
01:18:46,190 --> 01:18:51,190
And so we had all these things that we
could talk about and two hours into that

1180
01:18:51,381 --> 01:18:52,370
conversation,

1181
01:18:52,580 --> 01:18:56,420
never having touched upon technology.

1182
01:18:56,660 --> 01:19:00,530
He then basically said,
how would you like to come work with me?

1183
01:19:01,190 --> 01:19:04,790
And, um, I was living out
in Palo Alto at the time.

1184
01:19:04,970 --> 01:19:08,540
This is an opportunity in Boston.
And I remember not,

1185
01:19:08,541 --> 01:19:12,980
not even hesitating knowing that I
wanted to work with this, this person,

1186
01:19:12,981 --> 01:19:16,370
this human beings sitting
across the table from me, uh,

1187
01:19:16,371 --> 01:19:18,680
jumped at that opportunity.
And it wasn't,

1188
01:19:19,070 --> 01:19:21,140
it wasn't the fact that
was in venture capital,

1189
01:19:21,141 --> 01:19:26,141
but rather I really wanted the chance
to be working around someone like Ted

1190
01:19:27,290 --> 01:19:28,123
Dinner Smith at that time.

1191
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:31,650
Let's talk about that
interview for a second.

1192
01:19:31,810 --> 01:19:36,810
So that I think would strike some people
as a very unusual interviewing style.

1193
01:19:40,050 --> 01:19:42,810
Do you think in retrospect,
and maybe you know,

1194
01:19:42,870 --> 01:19:45,570
that he had already decided you
were fully capable of doing the job,

1195
01:19:45,571 --> 01:19:48,300
therefore didn't have to check that box
and just wanted to make sure that he

1196
01:19:48,301 --> 01:19:49,860
could work with you and
spend time with you.

1197
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:53,910
Was it that he was using the interview
to sell you so that when he made the

1198
01:19:53,911 --> 01:19:58,350
offer you would say yes. What do you
think was going through his mind before,

1199
01:19:58,351 --> 01:20:02,520
during, or after our, I suppose
before and during that conversation?

1200
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:04,280
You know,

1201
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:09,280
I think Ted is a very unique
human being in that when I,

1202
01:20:10,890 --> 01:20:15,750
I used to have this perception that
networking was work in a room and like you

1203
01:20:15,751 --> 01:20:20,751
shake a lot of hands and hold a lot of
babies and you learn a few names and you

1204
01:20:20,941 --> 01:20:21,774
move on.

1205
01:20:23,010 --> 01:20:28,010
I learned from Ted that networking is
actually a deep curiosity about the human

1206
01:20:30,151 --> 01:20:32,250
being who's sitting
across the table from you.

1207
01:20:32,790 --> 01:20:37,790
So I don't think he necessarily
had that kind of purpose in mind,

1208
01:20:38,161 --> 01:20:42,870
but that he was just really interested
in what I was interested in.

1209
01:20:42,990 --> 01:20:47,990
And we happened to find commonality and
he was trying to understand how my mind

1210
01:20:50,521 --> 01:20:54,460
worked in what I was interested in.
And I,

1211
01:20:54,461 --> 01:20:59,461
I've taken that as a real lesson
because I love the way he would network.

1212
01:21:00,871 --> 01:21:01,241
He,

1213
01:21:01,241 --> 01:21:06,241
he learned so much about
people in that process and um,

1214
01:21:07,830 --> 01:21:08,610
and,

1215
01:21:08,610 --> 01:21:13,560
and that's how he ministered
to his entrepreneurs.

1216
01:21:13,980 --> 01:21:16,650
He also,
um,

1217
01:21:16,710 --> 01:21:21,710
was capable of providing advice at the
right time because he really knew those

1218
01:21:22,111 --> 01:21:25,650
people. Uh, and so, so for me,

1219
01:21:26,220 --> 01:21:28,320
I felt like it was a
really unique interview.

1220
01:21:28,321 --> 01:21:31,110
It's stood out from all the
interviews I've ever had,

1221
01:21:32,190 --> 01:21:37,190
but I think he was learning more about
me than most other technical interviews

1222
01:21:38,881 --> 01:21:41,310
could have gotten to.
And then you know,

1223
01:21:41,340 --> 01:21:45,600
his other partners I think ease our mini
gave me sort of more of a case study

1224
01:21:45,601 --> 01:21:46,860
and could dive into that.

1225
01:21:46,861 --> 01:21:51,861
But Ted always had a deep curiosity
about the human being and not necessarily

1226
01:21:53,021 --> 01:21:54,790
just the skills.
Okay.

1227
01:21:55,360 --> 01:22:00,360
What else did you learn from
him or in that position in that,

1228
01:22:01,030 --> 01:22:01,863
in that job?

1229
01:22:04,870 --> 01:22:09,730
I thought that Ted was also an incredible
first principles thinker. So this,

1230
01:22:10,060 --> 01:22:14,960
my second day of work at
CRV was nine 11 and so,

1231
01:22:15,130 --> 01:22:20,010
so it was, you went from kind of
a bad economy to a horrible, um,

1232
01:22:20,050 --> 01:22:22,930
black whole economy and,

1233
01:22:23,470 --> 01:22:28,470
and so it was a really terrible time for
venture and they had just raised this

1234
01:22:29,350 --> 01:22:34,330
one point $4 billion fund.
And so that's,

1235
01:22:34,331 --> 01:22:35,470
I mean for venture,

1236
01:22:35,471 --> 01:22:40,471
that's a huge amount of money and it's a
huge accomplishment to convince so many

1237
01:22:41,441 --> 01:22:45,520
investors to invest in your venture
capital firm at that amount.

1238
01:22:46,390 --> 01:22:51,390
But then Ted took the time to actually
start to do analysis with me on how much

1239
01:22:53,491 --> 01:22:56,460
capital had gone into venture
capital at that moment.

1240
01:22:56,820 --> 01:23:00,000
And then the exits had stopped.
There are no more IPOs,

1241
01:23:00,030 --> 01:23:05,030
no one was acquiring companies at the
economy just came to a screeching halt and

1242
01:23:05,290 --> 01:23:10,290
he decided along with the other partners
in this firm to give back most of the

1243
01:23:12,761 --> 01:23:13,390
money.

1244
01:23:13,390 --> 01:23:18,390
So they reduced their fund from one
point $2 billion to $450 million.

1245
01:23:20,050 --> 01:23:25,050
And the reason why that's so interesting
and impressive is that the way a

1246
01:23:25,131 --> 01:23:27,070
venture capital firm makes money,

1247
01:23:27,610 --> 01:23:32,440
the way you have any salary or on the
operating money that you have for the firm

1248
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:36,520
is a direct percentage of
the fund that you raise.

1249
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:40,090
And so by shrinking the size of the fund,

1250
01:23:40,300 --> 01:23:44,890
you're shrinking the size of the
management fees that you get pretty

1251
01:23:44,891 --> 01:23:45,790
dramatically.

1252
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:49,290
Oh, for sure. Very dramatically.
I mean for people who don't know,

1253
01:23:49,291 --> 01:23:51,750
I mean you hear very often,
it's not always the case,

1254
01:23:51,751 --> 01:23:56,751
but in venture capital two and 22 and 20
and that means 2% management fee based

1255
01:23:57,931 --> 01:23:59,880
on the sort of assets under management,

1256
01:23:59,881 --> 01:24:03,750
meaning that particular fund and then
20% of the upside for people who don't

1257
01:24:03,751 --> 01:24:04,584
know.

1258
01:24:05,380 --> 01:24:09,610
And so, so they, they decided to
give back those management fees. And,

1259
01:24:09,970 --> 01:24:13,300
and to me that was really,
really impressive cause you're,

1260
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:18,400
you're facing now in a really terrible
economy and not only are you shrinking

1261
01:24:18,401 --> 01:24:23,110
the size of your fund to reflect that
you're also shrinking the size of your

1262
01:24:23,111 --> 01:24:27,190
management fees and you're,
you're taking that blow. Um,

1263
01:24:27,730 --> 01:24:32,650
and so, so things like that I learned,
I learned also, you know, how to,

1264
01:24:32,860 --> 01:24:37,860
how to shepherd companies through that
kind of difficult time and how to be a

1265
01:24:38,291 --> 01:24:42,190
true partner to an entrepreneur.
Um, and so, you know,

1266
01:24:42,191 --> 01:24:46,780
I think it was a really important lesson
to learn because I would argue most

1267
01:24:46,781 --> 01:24:48,940
people haven't seen real cycles.

1268
01:24:48,941 --> 01:24:52,930
People seem to think 2008 was a
real significant dip in the economy.

1269
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:58,560
But anyone who lived through 2001 knows
that 2008 was a blip compared to a real

1270
01:25:00,881 --> 01:25:04,740
downturn. And because
we've had a, you know,

1271
01:25:05,170 --> 01:25:10,170
raging bull market for such a long time
that that memory and that knowledge of,

1272
01:25:12,250 --> 01:25:14,310
of having survived,
you know,

1273
01:25:14,620 --> 01:25:19,620
2001 as a crisis period is something
that I hold with me really my war chest.

1274
01:25:20,981 --> 01:25:24,280
I know how to get through
that kind of time period.

1275
01:25:24,281 --> 01:25:25,810
And I don't think a lot of people do.

1276
01:25:27,020 --> 01:25:27,471
Yeah.

1277
01:25:27,471 --> 01:25:32,210
It makes me think of a lot of what I
heard in Silicon Valley still here.

1278
01:25:32,750 --> 01:25:36,590
I know before moving to Austin,
uh, which, which makes me think of,

1279
01:25:36,860 --> 01:25:37,970
I'm going to paraphrase this,

1280
01:25:37,971 --> 01:25:40,160
but it's a quote from Sir
John Templeton I think it is,

1281
01:25:40,161 --> 01:25:44,420
which is the most expensive words in
investing are this time it's different.

1282
01:25:46,010 --> 01:25:49,610
And uh,
it has been quite the bull run.

1283
01:25:49,611 --> 01:25:53,620
You mentioned first principles
thinking, uh, what, what are I want,

1284
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:56,690
I want to tie that into something
you mentioned related to your class.

1285
01:25:56,691 --> 01:25:58,310
Tough choices for leaders.

1286
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:02,540
What are some of the
toughest choices for leaders?

1287
01:26:02,541 --> 01:26:03,920
I suppose in this context,

1288
01:26:04,540 --> 01:26:09,410
CEO is or high level exacts
cofounders of companies, what does,

1289
01:26:09,411 --> 01:26:10,490
what are some of the,

1290
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:16,070
the toughest decisions that nonetheless
seem to come up fairly commonly?

1291
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:23,320
The most difficult thing
for a startup founders,

1292
01:26:23,321 --> 01:26:27,190
CEO leader is that especially when you're,

1293
01:26:28,780 --> 01:26:33,010
you, you witnessed multiple
phase changes in a business.

1294
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:38,470
And so if you imagine you're going
from absolutely nothing to something,

1295
01:26:38,471 --> 01:26:40,750
that's what I call the zero to one phase.

1296
01:26:41,260 --> 01:26:43,330
You're searching for product market fit,

1297
01:26:43,690 --> 01:26:45,940
you're trying to find the best customers,

1298
01:26:46,270 --> 01:26:51,040
you're trying to find where your
tenex advantage is truly valued.

1299
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:56,520
That's a very different business
process and truth seeking.

1300
01:26:57,640 --> 01:27:01,300
Then when you're going from one to acs,

1301
01:27:01,301 --> 01:27:06,010
which is now that I know what my value
proposition is, I'm going to add to that,

1302
01:27:06,011 --> 01:27:10,480
but I'm also going to pull on
some of these growth levers. The,

1303
01:27:10,540 --> 01:27:15,540
the fundamental job of a VP of marketing
who is in that zero to one phase

1304
01:27:17,260 --> 01:27:19,600
changes dramatically one to x.

1305
01:27:20,030 --> 01:27:25,030
It changes dramatically for the
salesperson in zero to one to one to x.

1306
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:25,950
Um,

1307
01:27:25,950 --> 01:27:30,950
and you go through this incredible Bermuda
Triangle where you have to navigate

1308
01:27:31,511 --> 01:27:34,630
that change. And so, so what,

1309
01:27:34,670 --> 01:27:37,350
what I see challenging for,

1310
01:27:37,351 --> 01:27:42,351
for startup founders is actually being
comfortable with your fundamental job

1311
01:27:44,710 --> 01:27:48,550
shifting from every three months.

1312
01:27:48,580 --> 01:27:53,050
You would have a massive shift in what
you need to focus on and how you need to

1313
01:27:53,051 --> 01:27:55,680
develop. And I think, you know, a,

1314
01:27:55,700 --> 01:28:00,440
an accompany is a
multidimensional thing in,

1315
01:28:00,441 --> 01:28:04,960
in, in Silicon Valley we spent so much
time thinking about product and product

1316
01:28:04,961 --> 01:28:09,961
market fit that we forget that there's
this huge emphasis you might want to

1317
01:28:10,961 --> 01:28:15,460
place on the fact that a
company is also an organization.

1318
01:28:16,120 --> 01:28:19,690
A company is also a category
that you're building.

1319
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:24,130
A company is also a business model,
you know, companies also a team.

1320
01:28:24,131 --> 01:28:26,470
And so it's,
it's,

1321
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:31,500
it's the skill set actually to balance
all of those things and knowing when

1322
01:28:32,920 --> 01:28:37,300
you've, you, you fundamentally need
to change out the talent in your team,

1323
01:28:38,140 --> 01:28:42,940
uh, the knowing when you actually
need to let go of a product.

1324
01:28:43,480 --> 01:28:48,070
Um, and knowing, actually to me
this is probably the hardest piece.

1325
01:28:49,060 --> 01:28:54,060
Knowing the difference between a winning
strategy versus a strategy not to lose.

1326
01:28:58,190 --> 01:29:02,190
Could you elaborate on
that please? Yeah. So

1327
01:29:02,190 --> 01:29:06,300
to me a strategy not to lose this
is a lot of different things.

1328
01:29:06,301 --> 01:29:09,480
It's to not to lose to a competitor,

1329
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:12,210
not to lose talent.
Uh,

1330
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:16,440
a strategy not to lose out on revenue.

1331
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:21,680
So it's all these fears that you
have of captured ground or uh,

1332
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:26,850
the fact that you might have someone
take over something that you're,

1333
01:29:26,970 --> 01:29:31,970
you want to do a competitor
who's breathing down your
neck versus a strategy for

1334
01:29:33,001 --> 01:29:35,790
winning is about where
do you double down on,

1335
01:29:35,910 --> 01:29:40,210
what do you do to capture
ground, to be aggressive, uh,

1336
01:29:40,350 --> 01:29:44,370
to play off offense and not defense.
To me,

1337
01:29:44,371 --> 01:29:49,200
that as a huge difference between that
strategy of I'm going to win in this

1338
01:29:49,201 --> 01:29:54,201
market versus I'm not going to lose and
not losing often invest in involves a

1339
01:29:56,221 --> 01:30:01,080
lot of hedging.
And when you feel that urge to hedge,

1340
01:30:01,140 --> 01:30:04,140
you need to focus. We,
you need to be offensive.

1341
01:30:04,210 --> 01:30:08,350
What, what, in what ways
might that hedging manifest?

1342
01:30:08,351 --> 01:30:13,351
What would be examples you've seen or
hypothetical's of the symptoms of a

1343
01:30:14,291 --> 01:30:17,860
defensive strategy in the form of hedging?

1344
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:22,660
Great question.
It might manifest itself in,

1345
01:30:23,140 --> 01:30:28,140
I am going to go after two very
different customer segments.

1346
01:30:29,050 --> 01:30:31,090
One is large enterprises.

1347
01:30:31,350 --> 01:30:36,350
There is small medium businesses and the
reason why that's really hedging is you

1348
01:30:37,271 --> 01:30:41,830
have two completely different ways of
selling to those organizations and you're

1349
01:30:41,831 --> 01:30:46,831
afraid to pick one because maybe
you have some revenue in both.

1350
01:30:47,500 --> 01:30:50,650
Right?
But in that situation,

1351
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:56,160
by not choosing to focus
on one group or the other,

1352
01:30:56,620 --> 01:31:01,420
you're probably a short changing your
team because you don't have a specialized

1353
01:31:01,421 --> 01:31:03,550
team to go after that opportunity.

1354
01:31:03,940 --> 01:31:07,180
You're short changing your business
model because you aren't pricing your

1355
01:31:07,181 --> 01:31:12,181
product correctly and you're shortchanging
the opportunity because probably your

1356
01:31:12,761 --> 01:31:16,030
product isn't optimized for that customer.
Set your,

1357
01:31:16,180 --> 01:31:20,950
your customer services and optimize
for that product set and your team is

1358
01:31:20,951 --> 01:31:24,460
ultimately confused because you're
heading in two completely different

1359
01:31:24,461 --> 01:31:28,840
conditions and directions. And
so I believe that, you know,

1360
01:31:29,090 --> 01:31:34,090
that's one of the most common ways that
I see people involved in a strategy of

1361
01:31:34,601 --> 01:31:37,260
not losing instead of
we're here to win it. Yeah.

1362
01:31:38,290 --> 01:31:38,530
Yeah.

1363
01:31:38,530 --> 01:31:43,530
All of those things you mentioned also
contribute to lighting money on fire.

1364
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:47,850
Right? I mean that's tests, that's
split focus. Just the bottom

1365
01:31:47,970 --> 01:31:49,730
fire,
the bonfire

1366
01:31:49,730 --> 01:31:54,440
of funding, uh, or cashflow
depending on where it comes from.

1367
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:58,970
Uh, the, this is really important and you
know this, but I want to underscore it.

1368
01:31:59,410 --> 01:32:00,280
People listening

1369
01:32:00,700 --> 01:32:05,700
and give a few other examples that might
be worth people might enjoy exploring.

1370
01:32:06,251 --> 01:32:11,251
So this winning versus not losing
distinction seems really subtle up,

1371
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:18,100
but you can get an in to, to feel
for it in a few different ways. Uh,

1372
01:32:18,340 --> 01:32:20,020
one is,
there's actually a,

1373
01:32:20,760 --> 01:32:25,760
I think it's a three part mini series
podcast called the making of Oprah and it

1374
01:32:26,471 --> 01:32:30,190
talks about the rise of Oprah.
I know this seems like an odd segue.

1375
01:32:30,610 --> 01:32:32,650
Oprah impresses the hell out of
me on a million different ways.

1376
01:32:32,651 --> 01:32:35,890
And after you listen to this, you'll
understand exactly why that's the case.

1377
01:32:35,891 --> 01:32:38,680
But she would constantly tell her team,

1378
01:32:39,640 --> 01:32:42,640
many of whom wanted to
respond to say Donahue,

1379
01:32:42,641 --> 01:32:45,280
who is the 800 pound gorilla at the time.

1380
01:32:45,310 --> 01:32:50,310
Like we need to raise our own race in the
sense that if you're on a thoroughbred

1381
01:32:50,951 --> 01:32:53,530
horse and you're in a race,
you need to focus on your race.

1382
01:32:53,530 --> 01:32:58,000
You can't be looking side to side
at the, the, the, the competitors,

1383
01:32:58,001 --> 01:33:00,550
the razors next year you get yourself
into a lot of trouble or you get really

1384
01:33:00,551 --> 01:33:04,760
injured. And the second is
if people want to Google, uh,

1385
01:33:04,840 --> 01:33:08,420
Dan Gable on aggression,
uh,

1386
01:33:08,460 --> 01:33:12,880
there's a short video I put on my
blog that hits this point exactly.

1387
01:33:12,881 --> 01:33:15,580
And I'm giving examples from
different disciplines because it is

1388
01:33:15,581 --> 01:33:19,320
crossdisciplinary. It's not just
investing in startups. Dan Gable is the,

1389
01:33:19,450 --> 01:33:23,230
the most legendary wrestling coach,
certainly of the last,

1390
01:33:23,231 --> 01:33:26,630
I would say a hundred years in
the United States. Uh, also, uh,

1391
01:33:26,770 --> 01:33:31,770
won a gold medal in the 1,972 Munich
Olympics without having a single point

1392
01:33:32,441 --> 01:33:37,120
scored on him. That just does
not happen. And uh, this video,

1393
01:33:37,121 --> 01:33:41,830
we'll show you a lecture that he's giving
one of his athletes after his athlete

1394
01:33:42,340 --> 01:33:47,320
tied and he said, you lost to him twice
before you just didn't want to lose.

1395
01:33:47,321 --> 01:33:51,640
He said, you never win that
way. You got to tie. And that's,

1396
01:33:51,670 --> 01:33:54,420
that's exactly why you got to tie and uh,

1397
01:33:54,640 --> 01:33:59,560
the differences is just so
powerful and it's, it's worth,

1398
01:33:59,590 --> 01:34:04,180
I just thought taking a
second to, to underscore it
because I think that uh, it's,

1399
01:34:04,230 --> 01:34:06,880
it's, it's really a critical
distinction that you brought up.

1400
01:34:08,850 --> 01:34:10,010
Like I think about it,

1401
01:34:10,430 --> 01:34:15,430
I love to ski and I had this instructor
once I was complaining about going

1402
01:34:15,741 --> 01:34:20,570
through powder and I was, I was saying
how it really hurt my, my thighs.

1403
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:23,660
He was like, my thighs are burning
and he looks at me and he said,

1404
01:34:23,900 --> 01:34:27,200
it's because you're not
leaning forward and,

1405
01:34:27,440 --> 01:34:31,700
and like the minute you lean forward,
suddenly you're just gliding.

1406
01:34:32,480 --> 01:34:37,480
And it's scary in that moment when you
lean forward because you feel like you're

1407
01:34:37,851 --> 01:34:42,851
gonna fall and yet it gives you so much
more control and it gives you so much.

1408
01:34:44,930 --> 01:34:47,780
It's so much less effort
counter intuitively.

1409
01:34:48,590 --> 01:34:52,010
And that to me is like
the perfect example of,

1410
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:57,400
oh like you have to actually have a
little bit of aggressiveness in order to

1411
01:34:58,701 --> 01:34:59,570
have the win.

1412
01:35:02,180 --> 01:35:07,120
I think you are, are well
suited in that respect. Uh,

1413
01:35:07,270 --> 01:35:09,420
how did, how did you meet the, uh,

1414
01:35:10,060 --> 01:35:15,060
how did you meet the man who
so famously tries to trick,

1415
01:35:15,640 --> 01:35:20,470
not trick that sounds too strong. Who so
commonly will say something like, well,

1416
01:35:20,890 --> 01:35:22,150
I'm just a southern boy.

1417
01:35:22,151 --> 01:35:25,720
Maybe you could slow down and explain
that one more time. Which by the way,

1418
01:35:25,721 --> 01:35:27,370
if you ever hear anything like that,

1419
01:35:27,371 --> 01:35:31,780
like really stop and pay attention because
you're, you are about to be tricked or

1420
01:35:33,510 --> 01:35:36,880
directed. I've actually borrowed that
and I use that for long, Long Island.

1421
01:35:36,881 --> 01:35:39,220
A lot of them like, you know, I'm just
a slow long island boy. Take a second.

1422
01:35:39,221 --> 01:35:43,410
Maybe you can explain that to me again.
How did you meet Mike Maples Jr?

1423
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:44,761
Yeah,

1424
01:35:44,761 --> 01:35:49,110
so this actually happened in one of the
classes that I was teaching at Stanford.

1425
01:35:49,170 --> 01:35:53,760
He was, uh, he was one of the
mentors for a bunch of teams.

1426
01:35:53,761 --> 01:35:57,330
So we had all these teams who
are creating business plans for,

1427
01:35:57,331 --> 01:35:59,640
for their own version
of a startup company.

1428
01:36:00,300 --> 01:36:04,530
And we had incredible mentors
to each of these teams. We had,

1429
01:36:04,830 --> 01:36:09,510
I think someone who was the
former CEO of verisign, we had,

1430
01:36:09,810 --> 01:36:12,810
I think Diane Greene might've
been a mentor to one of the teams

1431
01:36:13,230 --> 01:36:15,770
can we had Mike Maples and green
is for those who don't know,

1432
01:36:16,220 --> 01:36:20,210
Diane Greene is now the
head of Google cloud.

1433
01:36:20,211 --> 01:36:24,890
She was also the CEO of Vm ware.
Big Deal, a big, big deal, big deal,

1434
01:36:24,980 --> 01:36:28,040
big deal. Um, and what we,

1435
01:36:28,280 --> 01:36:32,990
what we did was we would team up some
of these entrepreneurs or people in

1436
01:36:32,991 --> 01:36:36,260
Silicon Valley with a student
team and Mike was one of them.

1437
01:36:36,710 --> 01:36:38,900
And for people who know Mike,

1438
01:36:38,901 --> 01:36:43,280
he's just this charming guy,
boy from Oklahoma.

1439
01:36:43,940 --> 01:36:47,660
He calls himself sometimes
a washed up enterprise, uh,

1440
01:36:48,190 --> 01:36:52,210
VC and are washed up
enterprise entrepreneur,

1441
01:36:53,890 --> 01:36:56,370
but he's not.
And uh,

1442
01:36:56,410 --> 01:37:00,490
so he came to our class and
he was mentoring this team,

1443
01:37:00,491 --> 01:37:02,530
but he was actually being too nice.

1444
01:37:03,010 --> 01:37:07,390
And so this team was having
like all sorts of weird issues.

1445
01:37:07,391 --> 01:37:10,510
They were fighting and they came to my
office hours and one of them started to

1446
01:37:10,511 --> 01:37:12,850
cry and

1447
01:37:13,360 --> 01:37:15,760
spotting a theme here within proximity of

1448
01:37:16,420 --> 01:37:19,190
right. I did not make this
teeth number cry. It was,

1449
01:37:19,330 --> 01:37:20,890
they were making each other cry.

1450
01:37:22,570 --> 01:37:25,660
And so I was just kind of,
I was really,

1451
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:30,990
I was kind of mad at Mike
because part of the, the,

1452
01:37:31,090 --> 01:37:36,090
the role of the mentor is to help
shepherd them through this tough points.

1453
01:37:36,910 --> 01:37:41,710
And he was just kind of checked out
on that front. And, and I emailed him,

1454
01:37:41,711 --> 01:37:45,910
he said, Oh yeah, my team's doing great.
And I said, well, I kind of beg to differ.

1455
01:37:46,230 --> 01:37:46,450
Uh,

1456
01:37:46,450 --> 01:37:50,050
they were just in my office and one of
them started crying and they're fighting

1457
01:37:50,051 --> 01:37:52,330
and right now if they
don't pull it together,

1458
01:37:52,331 --> 01:37:56,910
they're really gonna fail the class. And
he wrote me this message that said, well,

1459
01:37:56,911 --> 01:37:58,590
I think they're going to get an a plus.

1460
01:38:01,340 --> 01:38:04,890
And so I said, well, so
far, not tracking. And,

1461
01:38:05,100 --> 01:38:10,080
and so we just sort of have this friendly
banter and actually the team does turn

1462
01:38:10,081 --> 01:38:14,830
it around and they ended up getting
an a plus in the class. And, um,

1463
01:38:15,810 --> 01:38:19,280
or did he just throw some turtle shells
on a desk and like divine his way to

1464
01:38:19,281 --> 01:38:20,114
that outcome?

1465
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:22,150
I,
I'm not really sure,

1466
01:38:22,151 --> 01:38:26,440
but I actually take full credit for the
turnaround because had I not pointed it

1467
01:38:26,441 --> 01:38:30,760
out to Mike, then the team
would have just imploded and,

1468
01:38:30,820 --> 01:38:35,720
and so, um, so based on that interaction,

1469
01:38:35,750 --> 01:38:36,260
you know,

1470
01:38:36,260 --> 01:38:41,260
a few years later I was starting to
get to a point in my phd where I was

1471
01:38:42,111 --> 01:38:46,940
thinking of starting my own company
and I had started my phd in computer

1472
01:38:46,941 --> 01:38:51,941
security exactly because I knew that
it didn't matter when I graduated there

1473
01:38:52,731 --> 01:38:57,320
would be a computer security
problem out there and I would be,

1474
01:38:57,321 --> 01:39:00,020
I wouldn't be at risk of market timing.

1475
01:39:00,740 --> 01:39:05,740
And it was sort of a perfect opportunity
because just as I was going through my

1476
01:39:06,081 --> 01:39:07,010
research,

1477
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:12,140
it was from 2003 to 2007 at this point,

1478
01:39:12,410 --> 01:39:16,760
we had transformed from this world of
where security used to be a bunch of

1479
01:39:16,761 --> 01:39:21,761
vandalism problems to now there are
companies involved in like real money was

1480
01:39:22,371 --> 01:39:25,970
being involved.
And so real crime was being created here.

1481
01:39:26,270 --> 01:39:30,320
And then towards the end there was really
like nation state warfare starting to

1482
01:39:30,321 --> 01:39:33,230
happen.
And so my,

1483
01:39:33,290 --> 01:39:38,290
my research was really in risk management
of computer security and I knew that

1484
01:39:40,311 --> 01:39:42,440
this was becoming a huge issue.

1485
01:39:42,890 --> 01:39:46,940
And so I started to think
I'm going to make a company.

1486
01:39:48,770 --> 01:39:53,770
And so at that moment I turned to some
of my advisors and my advisors were nice

1487
01:39:56,481 --> 01:40:00,170
enough to say, hey, um, if you're
thinking about starting company,

1488
01:40:00,470 --> 01:40:03,290
you've been in the ivory towers
for literally four years,

1489
01:40:03,350 --> 01:40:07,730
so you should get out of the classroom
and go check out some angel investors.

1490
01:40:09,440 --> 01:40:14,270
And then Mike was one of the first people
I turn to and I asked him if I could

1491
01:40:14,271 --> 01:40:18,160
see his deal flow and he was
nice enough to say, sure,

1492
01:40:18,170 --> 01:40:22,040
why don't you just come in and take
a look at my deal flow on Wednesdays?

1493
01:40:22,041 --> 01:40:25,910
And so we would sit next to each
other and look at companies and

1494
01:40:26,210 --> 01:40:27,370
I mean, you get the, the,

1495
01:40:27,410 --> 01:40:31,330
the sort of top of the funnel companies
that he's considering potentially

1496
01:40:31,331 --> 01:40:32,164
investing in,

1497
01:40:32,350 --> 01:40:36,070
right? They would come in and pitch
for between 30 minutes and an hour.

1498
01:40:36,760 --> 01:40:41,090
And then at the end of that, I,
um, I think it was, you know,

1499
01:40:41,350 --> 01:40:46,350
March of 2008 he calls me is I'm
actually going up to Tahoe to ski.

1500
01:40:48,070 --> 01:40:53,020
He calls me to say, Hey, and
um, I have this great idea.

1501
01:40:54,610 --> 01:40:57,520
I just raised my first fund.

1502
01:40:57,640 --> 01:41:02,640
It's $35 million and I think that you
should drop out of your phd program and

1503
01:41:06,671 --> 01:41:07,504
join me.

1504
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:11,710
And it's not the venture back startup
that you've been thinking about,

1505
01:41:12,250 --> 01:41:14,980
but it's now a backed venture startup.

1506
01:41:15,510 --> 01:41:20,410
Let's go. I like that. That's really good.

1507
01:41:20,411 --> 01:41:23,190
Now was that an immediate yes.
Or is it a let me sleep on it.

1508
01:41:24,070 --> 01:41:28,900
I actually thought he was
crazy because first of all,

1509
01:41:30,180 --> 01:41:35,150
you know, I was literally, again, I was
a nobody. I, I'm, I'm a phd candidate.

1510
01:41:35,151 --> 01:41:38,210
I didn't even have my degree at Stanford.

1511
01:41:38,360 --> 01:41:42,140
So there's like all these business
school students, there's great, you know,

1512
01:41:42,141 --> 01:41:45,650
Angel investors milling around the,
the major question was like,

1513
01:41:45,651 --> 01:41:48,800
why does this guy think that I
would actually be a good investor?

1514
01:41:49,610 --> 01:41:54,610
And then the second piece
was there weren't a ton of
venture capital firms that

1515
01:41:56,331 --> 01:42:01,280
were being started up. So even when I
went back to people who were my mentors,

1516
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:05,060
some of them said,
why would you go to a no name VC?

1517
01:42:05,061 --> 01:42:10,061
Why won't chew go and be an associate
at Kleiner Perkins or excel or you know,

1518
01:42:12,921 --> 01:42:16,490
sequoia. Yeah. And I didn't
really have a good answer.

1519
01:42:16,790 --> 01:42:19,490
Um, just to set the stage
for folks who don't know,

1520
01:42:19,670 --> 01:42:24,670
maybe the recent history in Silicon
Valley at the time that Mike had proposed

1521
01:42:25,551 --> 01:42:26,384
this to you,

1522
01:42:27,020 --> 01:42:31,550
sort of microcap venture capital
was barely a thing, right?

1523
01:42:31,551 --> 01:42:32,900
I mean it's,
it's there,

1524
01:42:32,901 --> 01:42:35,870
there are a lot of funds of all
sorts of different sizes now,

1525
01:42:35,871 --> 01:42:38,300
but at the time this was very unusual.

1526
01:42:39,260 --> 01:42:42,480
Yeah. And so it was, you know,

1527
01:42:42,530 --> 01:42:46,990
this point and when you get to
2018 there's probably, you know,

1528
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:52,000
30 funds being pitched a week to a limited
partner who invest into these venture

1529
01:42:52,371 --> 01:42:55,280
capital firms. But back then
there was very, very few.

1530
01:42:55,850 --> 01:43:00,850
And so it was really a question
of is this the smart thing to do?

1531
01:43:01,610 --> 01:43:05,540
And I think this is sort of where, you
know, when you turned to an entrepreneur,

1532
01:43:05,750 --> 01:43:09,410
this is the feeling that
they get. Um, what I,

1533
01:43:09,470 --> 01:43:14,090
what I sensed was there was actually
a major change of foot. I'll,

1534
01:43:14,110 --> 01:43:19,110
all of the students around me at Stanford
didn't need $5 million to start a

1535
01:43:19,671 --> 01:43:23,750
company. And that's what venture
capital was offering to startups.

1536
01:43:23,810 --> 01:43:28,730
At that point they would say, I will
buy 50% of your company for $5 million.

1537
01:43:28,840 --> 01:43:33,630
Right? Is predicated on the entry costs
being very high. And some are very,

1538
01:43:33,631 --> 01:43:34,464
very high.

1539
01:43:34,510 --> 01:43:36,760
And like at that point,
you know,

1540
01:43:37,420 --> 01:43:39,610
we suddenly have open source software.

1541
01:43:39,611 --> 01:43:43,210
We really have what starting
to look like cloud computing,

1542
01:43:43,370 --> 01:43:45,010
we have all the shared resources.

1543
01:43:45,011 --> 01:43:50,011
So even though I was helping to run
servers and the closet at my Grad in our

1544
01:43:51,801 --> 01:43:56,060
lab, that was starting to become
something that we didn't need.

1545
01:43:56,061 --> 01:43:57,830
There was actually,
you know,

1546
01:43:57,831 --> 01:44:01,190
services that you can use
where you could rent services.

1547
01:44:01,580 --> 01:44:04,270
And so to me,
uh,

1548
01:44:04,660 --> 01:44:07,600
there was a dramatic
change that was happening.

1549
01:44:07,601 --> 01:44:10,450
And so you had to change
the financing environment.

1550
01:44:11,020 --> 01:44:15,520
And so I felt like I could see
something that everyone else didn't see,

1551
01:44:15,521 --> 01:44:20,080
that Mike was also seeing. And he used
to save 100,000 is the new 5 million.

1552
01:44:21,010 --> 01:44:22,560
And,
and,

1553
01:44:22,720 --> 01:44:26,020
and then the second piece
for me was this guy,

1554
01:44:26,021 --> 01:44:30,340
Mike maples had a skillset
I had never seen before.

1555
01:44:30,341 --> 01:44:33,940
I made maybe in like one or two
other people in my entire lifetime,

1556
01:44:34,270 --> 01:44:39,270
but he was this incredible marketer
and I used to believe you either build

1557
01:44:41,591 --> 01:44:43,060
things or you sold things.

1558
01:44:43,120 --> 01:44:47,680
Everything else just seemed like
an extraneous skillset to have.

1559
01:44:47,890 --> 01:44:52,890
Mike was incredible at
storytelling and positioning and,

1560
01:44:55,050 --> 01:44:56,440
and,
and strategy,

1561
01:44:56,441 --> 01:45:01,441
like real strategy for how do you create
a new category and how do you build

1562
01:45:03,251 --> 01:45:06,430
that category and how do you
create the king of that category.

1563
01:45:07,420 --> 01:45:09,520
And as an engineer,

1564
01:45:10,480 --> 01:45:14,170
I had a thought about what you
do after you build the product.

1565
01:45:14,740 --> 01:45:19,740
And so this magic of category creation
to me was something that almost felt like

1566
01:45:22,811 --> 01:45:26,380
magic.
And so I looked at Mike and I thought,

1567
01:45:26,500 --> 01:45:30,670
I really need to learn from this person.
And,

1568
01:45:30,671 --> 01:45:34,840
and not only is it a great skill
set that I'm learning from,

1569
01:45:35,020 --> 01:45:38,510
he is also genuinely one of
the best human beings that,

1570
01:45:38,660 --> 01:45:40,090
that I've ever encountered.

1571
01:45:40,091 --> 01:45:44,410
And so it was just sort of this magical
combination of someone whose values

1572
01:45:44,411 --> 01:45:49,090
really aligned with me and how I wanted
to build a firm and the things that I

1573
01:45:49,091 --> 01:45:54,091
wanted to do with that and how I wanted
to treat entrepreneurs and in a person

1574
01:45:54,401 --> 01:45:59,350
who was a mad genius. And so that
combination to me was irresistible.

1575
01:45:59,351 --> 01:46:02,890
And so a couple of months
into it, I said, sign me up

1576
01:46:04,020 --> 01:46:08,950
a couple of months. All right.
So question number one, just for,

1577
01:46:08,980 --> 01:46:11,210
for people who are wondering,
and I know a lot of people,

1578
01:46:11,211 --> 01:46:15,980
you seem very good at avoiding the sunk
cost fallacy and this is so, so, so key,

1579
01:46:16,250 --> 01:46:18,490
this cognitive bias.
Uh,

1580
01:46:18,890 --> 01:46:23,780
when you were looking at the
quitting of the PHD program,

1581
01:46:23,870 --> 01:46:27,370
did you, I don't know how it
works at Stanford, but did,

1582
01:46:27,530 --> 01:46:29,840
did you realize you could kind of,
you didn't have to quit?

1583
01:46:30,600 --> 01:46:31,950
I did not quit.
So,

1584
01:46:32,610 --> 01:46:37,610
so that first year and a half of my life
within at floodgate was crazy because

1585
01:46:38,730 --> 01:46:43,730
at that point I joined floodgate
and I have an 18 month old child,

1586
01:46:44,070 --> 01:46:48,510
my daughter Abby. And then I, you know,

1587
01:46:48,570 --> 01:46:50,850
I think it four or five months into it,

1588
01:46:50,940 --> 01:46:53,640
I am pregnant with my second child.

1589
01:46:53,940 --> 01:46:58,940
I've promised my mother as any good Asian
daughter would that I will finish this

1590
01:46:59,250 --> 01:47:00,960
phd if it's the last thing I do.

1591
01:47:00,961 --> 01:47:05,961
So I'm waking up at like four o'clock
in the morning doing research until,

1592
01:47:06,360 --> 01:47:07,700
you know,
seven when she went,

1593
01:47:07,740 --> 01:47:12,630
my daughter wakes up and then taking her
to daycare and then working from like

1594
01:47:12,900 --> 01:47:17,900
eight 30 to six 30 at floodgate and
then coming back doing dinner and then

1595
01:47:19,671 --> 01:47:22,010
working on my phd again,
Rinse and repeat.

1596
01:47:22,730 --> 01:47:27,730
And then I got pregnant with my second
child a few months into that and then,

1597
01:47:28,370 --> 01:47:31,550
um,
decided I was going to defend my phd.

1598
01:47:31,940 --> 01:47:35,780
They set the date for six weeks
after I gave birth to my son.

1599
01:47:36,200 --> 01:47:38,310
And so, you know, I,

1600
01:47:38,440 --> 01:47:42,050
I not only did my first
set of investments,

1601
01:47:42,080 --> 01:47:46,670
but also had gave birth to a child,

1602
01:47:46,820 --> 01:47:51,820
cared for another one and managed to
stay married and finish this phd all

1603
01:47:54,351 --> 01:47:58,580
between 2008 and 2009. And so, you know,

1604
01:47:58,700 --> 01:48:03,700
to me like that's like the most creative
and probably productive period of my

1605
01:48:04,821 --> 01:48:07,670
life ever and probably will be,
but,

1606
01:48:07,700 --> 01:48:12,700
but also showed me that I can actually
do a lot of things that everyone around

1607
01:48:13,311 --> 01:48:16,070
me was like, why would you do all
of those things at the same time?

1608
01:48:18,670 --> 01:48:23,360
How does, how does this seem like a non
sequitur? Kind of is, but uh, how does,

1609
01:48:23,860 --> 01:48:28,780
how does your mom say your name? Because
Anne is sort of an unusual first name.

1610
01:48:29,560 --> 01:48:32,800
Oh, no, but that's what my first
name, my first name is Nicole

1611
01:48:33,180 --> 01:48:34,013
nickel.

1612
01:48:34,490 --> 01:48:37,090
Yeah. So how does my
mom say she was like, no

1613
01:48:38,020 --> 01:48:41,300
Vaco Dayco chances going there.

1614
01:48:42,230 --> 01:48:45,740
I can barely, that's another word.
Everybody should look up and learn.

1615
01:48:45,800 --> 01:48:49,430
Shug I sequoia and uh,

1616
01:48:50,030 --> 01:48:51,770
that just means sort of awesome,
impressive,

1617
01:48:51,850 --> 01:48:56,780
whole all sort of things because I can
barely manage to brush my teeth and

1618
01:48:56,781 --> 01:48:58,760
shower on a daily basis.

1619
01:48:59,150 --> 01:49:02,540
And yet you're doing all
these things simultaneously.

1620
01:49:03,980 --> 01:49:08,980
I have to pause at this point
just to try to fill out the,

1621
01:49:10,610 --> 01:49:11,443
the,
some of the,

1622
01:49:11,880 --> 01:49:16,250
the colors of who [inaudible] is.

1623
01:49:17,900 --> 01:49:21,530
What have you struggled with? Like
have you had any dark, really,

1624
01:49:21,550 --> 01:49:24,260
d doesn't have to be dark,
but difficult times,

1625
01:49:24,261 --> 01:49:28,010
dark times that you could
tell us about and where you,

1626
01:49:28,040 --> 01:49:32,900
where you really struggled or is that
not part of your sort of lexicon?

1627
01:49:34,110 --> 01:49:36,690
No, I think we, we all
have struggles, right?

1628
01:49:36,691 --> 01:49:41,691
So I think even in this moment of like
the Phd and caring for my kids and caring

1629
01:49:45,781 --> 01:49:48,610
for myself and my,
and my family and all,

1630
01:49:49,090 --> 01:49:53,650
and trying to do a good job at
work, like things slip, right?

1631
01:49:53,680 --> 01:49:55,390
And, and I, I,

1632
01:49:55,510 --> 01:49:59,770
I struggle with this still today and this
is where the darkness comes in is like,

1633
01:49:59,800 --> 01:50:04,720
am I doing anything? Well, like,
am I a good mother? Am I, you know,

1634
01:50:04,760 --> 01:50:07,470
I, I didn't, I wasn't today, my,

1635
01:50:07,471 --> 01:50:10,840
my six year old is on a
field trip and he asked me,

1636
01:50:11,050 --> 01:50:13,630
why is it that you never
get to come on a field trip?

1637
01:50:14,320 --> 01:50:18,430
Like those are all these
moments where you wonder like,

1638
01:50:18,431 --> 01:50:22,490
am I failing at being a
parent or you know, Aye I,

1639
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:27,470
Aye not able to get to the dishes.
And My, I had a moment where my,

1640
01:50:27,600 --> 01:50:32,450
my front door neighbor is actually a
Japanese woman, a nosy Japanese woman.

1641
01:50:32,600 --> 01:50:35,980
She went up, she went up to my
mother and she said, you know,

1642
01:50:35,981 --> 01:50:37,690
your family is so strange.

1643
01:50:38,140 --> 01:50:42,430
I always see the husband doing
the dishes but never the wife,

1644
01:50:42,520 --> 01:50:43,540
never the wife

1645
01:50:45,170 --> 01:50:47,890
that is the most nosy Japanese
neighbor thing to say ever.

1646
01:50:48,850 --> 01:50:51,730
Like I spent two days like in,
in that,

1647
01:50:51,731 --> 01:50:56,590
in that front window doing dishes. And
at some point I was like, oh, screw this.

1648
01:50:56,940 --> 01:50:58,360
Um,
but,

1649
01:50:59,620 --> 01:51:04,620
but it's like all it is this constant
battle of how do I figure out what my

1650
01:51:05,981 --> 01:51:10,981
priority is so that I
have like minimum viable,

1651
01:51:12,040 --> 01:51:16,510
you know, progress on some fronts. And
then the thing that really matters,

1652
01:51:16,511 --> 01:51:20,170
I'm going to make massive
progress on. And so, so that,

1653
01:51:20,470 --> 01:51:25,030
that's where the darkness creeps
in. I think, you know, for me, my,

1654
01:51:25,031 --> 01:51:30,031
my really loser moments
have been things like,

1655
01:51:31,300 --> 01:51:31,630
you know,

1656
01:51:31,630 --> 01:51:36,630
early on I just described to you early
how there were tests that always said

1657
01:51:36,761 --> 01:51:40,960
like, I wasn't that smart.
There were, you know,

1658
01:51:41,110 --> 01:51:45,790
lots of examples where I wasn't good
at a lot of different things that other

1659
01:51:45,791 --> 01:51:47,440
people found very normal.

1660
01:51:47,470 --> 01:51:52,470
Like I was horrible at standardized tests
only until I got to like senior year

1661
01:51:53,770 --> 01:51:56,590
or junior year in high school.
Did I finally figure it out?

1662
01:51:56,591 --> 01:52:01,591
Like there's so many places where so
many people said distinctly average,

1663
01:52:03,340 --> 01:52:06,370
maybe not even that smart.
And,

1664
01:52:06,850 --> 01:52:11,850
and I think for me it's been learning to
tune out the naysayers and knowing that

1665
01:52:15,230 --> 01:52:18,220
there are certainly a lot of
things I'm not going to be good at,

1666
01:52:18,550 --> 01:52:22,490
but there are things that I
can actually be great at. Um,

1667
01:52:22,570 --> 01:52:25,750
a really good example of
that actually is my phd.

1668
01:52:26,170 --> 01:52:31,170
I remember when I got to my phd
at Stanford and I'm starting,

1669
01:52:31,900 --> 01:52:32,621
first of all,

1670
01:52:32,621 --> 01:52:37,621
like I took a math class and there were
high school or college freshmen in this

1671
01:52:37,871 --> 01:52:42,871
class and it felt like the math teacher
was speaking Greek and the freshmen are

1672
01:52:43,391 --> 01:52:47,300
flying through this material because
they're like little kid geniuses.

1673
01:52:48,080 --> 01:52:50,690
And I remember thinking to myself,
well,

1674
01:52:50,691 --> 01:52:54,860
clearly I should not be
getting a phd in math.

1675
01:52:54,861 --> 01:52:57,680
And thank goodness this
is an operations research.

1676
01:52:58,340 --> 01:53:03,340
Then I had this second
experience where the professor,

1677
01:53:03,561 --> 01:53:07,730
a new professor came in across the hall
from me. His name is Ramesh Johari.

1678
01:53:08,210 --> 01:53:08,960
And uh,

1679
01:53:08,960 --> 01:53:13,960
he was my age because I had taken
five years off to start my phd.

1680
01:53:14,420 --> 01:53:18,350
He was literally my age
and he was incredible.

1681
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:23,800
He could remember things about different
papers and theorems and how they were

1682
01:53:23,831 --> 01:53:27,890
proved from like years past,
compare and contrast them.

1683
01:53:28,340 --> 01:53:32,690
He just knew things that
I struggled to remember.

1684
01:53:32,750 --> 01:53:37,400
And I remember looking at him and being
in one of his seminars and thinking to

1685
01:53:37,401 --> 01:53:41,480
myself, that is world class
as an academic. And I'm,

1686
01:53:41,690 --> 01:53:46,250
I'm okay at it. But I would have
moments where I was like, I'm,

1687
01:53:46,340 --> 01:53:48,050
I'm actually not even good at it.

1688
01:53:48,890 --> 01:53:51,620
And then I would go to a
conference and like when you,

1689
01:53:51,650 --> 01:53:55,910
when you compare yourself against the
world of Phd students and obvious,

1690
01:53:56,220 --> 01:53:58,820
then you start to develop a
little bit more confidence.

1691
01:53:59,060 --> 01:54:01,940
Then you go back to Sanford and
you see what world classes and,

1692
01:54:02,270 --> 01:54:06,620
and I was thinking to myself,
this isn't the path and there's a,

1693
01:54:06,621 --> 01:54:10,130
there's a place where I actually can
use the skill sets that I do have,

1694
01:54:10,400 --> 01:54:15,110
where I can be really good at the
things that I'm doing. And so if, if I,

1695
01:54:15,111 --> 01:54:17,690
if I, I'm sitting here
saying, you know, oh,

1696
01:54:17,691 --> 01:54:20,900
I was always good at everything
that I did. It's just not true.

1697
01:54:20,901 --> 01:54:24,650
There are so many moments where I
realized it's like being a doctor.

1698
01:54:24,651 --> 01:54:28,610
I said I would not be
good at being a doctor.

1699
01:54:28,940 --> 01:54:33,680
I would not be great at being an academic.

1700
01:54:33,980 --> 01:54:37,460
I would not be great at a
lot of different things.

1701
01:54:37,640 --> 01:54:42,640
Just knowing and having the self awareness
of where I would double down is I

1702
01:54:42,891 --> 01:54:45,470
think what, what I was good at. And so,

1703
01:54:46,190 --> 01:54:47,900
so it makes the,

1704
01:54:47,901 --> 01:54:52,850
this emergent life where I was
going from one track to another,

1705
01:54:52,851 --> 01:54:57,620
I was going to be a doctor and then I
went to Mckinsey and then I went to VC and

1706
01:54:57,621 --> 01:55:01,340
then I went to get a phd
and then it went back to VC.

1707
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:07,000
This is all self discovery rather than
a stated path that I had career plan for

1708
01:55:07,851 --> 01:55:08,684
a long time.

1709
01:55:09,540 --> 01:55:11,420
Well it strikes me also that,

1710
01:55:12,070 --> 01:55:15,950
and maybe I'm trying to create narrative
where there isn't one or connection,

1711
01:55:15,951 --> 01:55:20,951
but it seems reasonable that Mike's
superpower or one of his abilities to help

1712
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:31,000
create categories and then sort of
mint kings within a given category is

1713
01:55:32,540 --> 01:55:36,620
actually a different species of
something that you're also good at,

1714
01:55:36,650 --> 01:55:40,220
which is kind of a Jack Welch,

1715
01:55:40,221 --> 01:55:44,400
Ian in a sense. And that is you're looking
at the different paths you could take.

1716
01:55:45,060 --> 01:55:49,020
And if you can't be saying number
one or number two in that thing,

1717
01:55:49,410 --> 01:55:53,160
it just gets rolled out and you're
asking this world class question over and

1718
01:55:53,161 --> 01:55:53,641
over again.

1719
01:55:53,641 --> 01:55:57,980
And one way is to find something where
you can dominate and really be world

1720
01:55:57,981 --> 01:55:58,321
class.

1721
01:55:58,321 --> 01:56:03,321
And the other is to create an
entirely new category in a sense.

1722
01:56:03,990 --> 01:56:08,340
So it seems like you and Mike are very
complimentary in that way and have that

1723
01:56:08,640 --> 01:56:11,060
shared programming. Uh, I've,

1724
01:56:11,130 --> 01:56:16,130
I've heard people describe you as an
investor when your strengths is being

1725
01:56:16,471 --> 01:56:20,940
technical, which I suppose seems
self evident given your background,

1726
01:56:20,970 --> 01:56:25,350
but how would your colleagues,
how would,

1727
01:56:25,380 --> 01:56:28,110
how would Mike,
let's say describe your,

1728
01:56:28,760 --> 01:56:31,370
if I asked him what her aunt
superpowers is an investor,

1729
01:56:31,420 --> 01:56:33,510
there are a lot of investors out there.
What is,

1730
01:56:34,070 --> 01:56:37,500
what is ends superpower set of
super powers? What would he say?

1731
01:56:40,660 --> 01:56:41,830
I think for me,

1732
01:56:42,400 --> 01:56:46,810
the super powers I have or a few folds.

1733
01:56:46,811 --> 01:56:50,250
So one is because of the,

1734
01:56:50,251 --> 01:56:55,251
the technical capabilities that I have
when someone is describing particularly

1735
01:56:56,020 --> 01:56:59,860
anything that has to do with math.
And Luckily for me right now,

1736
01:56:59,890 --> 01:57:04,890
math is having this incredible resurgence
in artificial intelligence and in

1737
01:57:05,430 --> 01:57:10,390
cryptocurrency, I, I can get that piece.

1738
01:57:10,630 --> 01:57:15,630
I can get that piece better than I would
say probably 99% of the investors out

1739
01:57:16,211 --> 01:57:19,540
there.
And so if I get a math paper,

1740
01:57:19,960 --> 01:57:22,540
that's something that I love to dig into.

1741
01:57:22,870 --> 01:57:27,870
And that technical insight is something
that I think I'm better at than most

1742
01:57:28,570 --> 01:57:30,040
other investors out there.

1743
01:57:30,820 --> 01:57:35,820
And then from there I can also start to
piece together what that company will

1744
01:57:37,181 --> 01:57:39,400
look like around that technology.

1745
01:57:39,940 --> 01:57:44,170
And so it's not just I'm looking
for great r and d projects,

1746
01:57:44,171 --> 01:57:49,171
but ones that are ripe to
be big D and little r and,

1747
01:57:50,380 --> 01:57:53,800
and I think that's a super power,
especially at the very early stage.

1748
01:57:53,980 --> 01:57:58,930
So one of the companies that I
invested in back in 2010, uh, Yosty,

1749
01:57:59,260 --> 01:58:02,680
they've gone over a hundred million
dollars in financing at this point.

1750
01:58:03,130 --> 01:58:06,250
And I found them when they were,

1751
01:58:06,700 --> 01:58:08,590
they didn't even have a business plan.

1752
01:58:08,591 --> 01:58:13,060
They had four math papers
that they sent to me. And,

1753
01:58:13,120 --> 01:58:17,980
and so to me that, that's something
that I, I doubled down on and it's a,

1754
01:58:17,981 --> 01:58:22,000
it's a part of the types of
investments that I like to do. Um,

1755
01:58:22,001 --> 01:58:25,050
that's very different from,
you know, the task grab.

1756
01:58:25,051 --> 01:58:29,440
It's refinery 29 and lift that
I've done in the past as well.

1757
01:58:30,550 --> 01:58:34,540
I think the other superpower that is a
little bit less, seven is more of an,

1758
01:58:34,600 --> 01:58:39,600
as I'm working with people is I feel like
I have a pretty good sixth sense about

1759
01:58:40,810 --> 01:58:43,630
the dynamics within an organization.

1760
01:58:43,930 --> 01:58:47,320
So I can tell when there's
actually in fighting happening.

1761
01:58:47,560 --> 01:58:52,560
I can sense when a executive
is starting to disengage.

1762
01:58:52,870 --> 01:58:54,730
Um,
and those are things that,

1763
01:58:54,731 --> 01:58:58,840
that I work on with a lot of
the CEOs that I work with.

1764
01:58:59,410 --> 01:59:00,890
Um,
and then the,

1765
01:59:00,891 --> 01:59:05,891
the last piece that I think I really
love to engage in is the fundamental data

1766
01:59:06,851 --> 01:59:09,310
behind the business. And so, um,

1767
01:59:09,370 --> 01:59:14,370
I love looking at the cohort
analysis and really engaging on data,

1768
01:59:15,210 --> 01:59:16,450
uh,
because that's,

1769
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:20,650
that's a piece of the puzzle that I
feel like I'm also good at encoding

1770
01:59:20,950 --> 01:59:21,783
uninviting.

1771
01:59:23,800 --> 01:59:26,980
What are you looking for now?
And water thunder lizards.

1772
01:59:26,981 --> 01:59:30,490
We mentioned hunting thunder
lizards earlier and I
promised I would come back to

1773
01:59:30,491 --> 01:59:30,581
it.

1774
01:59:30,581 --> 01:59:35,581
So maybe we define that first and perhaps
you could tell us what you're looking

1775
01:59:37,391 --> 01:59:38,770
for at the moment.

1776
01:59:40,150 --> 01:59:44,860
Yeah, so, so a thunder
lizard is inspired, um,

1777
01:59:45,300 --> 01:59:50,280
by Godzilla. It's a term that Mike, my
partner used to always tell this story,

1778
01:59:51,060 --> 01:59:56,060
which is that we are inspired by
entrepreneurs who are like Godzilla.

1779
01:59:58,440 --> 02:00:00,870
And so what is Godzilla like?

1780
02:00:00,871 --> 02:00:04,860
He's born from radioactive atomic eggs.

1781
02:00:04,861 --> 02:00:09,840
So the DNA of that entrepreneurs
already fundamentally different.

1782
02:00:10,410 --> 02:00:15,390
And then he swims across the Pacific
Ocean and depending on if you're Mike or

1783
02:00:15,391 --> 02:00:16,170
me,

1784
02:00:16,170 --> 02:00:21,170
he lands in either the bay area or
Tokyo and starts to wreak havoc and eats

1785
02:00:22,111 --> 02:00:27,111
trains and automobiles and buildings
and then proceeds to crush that,

1786
02:00:30,090 --> 02:00:34,950
that industry and creates disruption
and then build something out of that.

1787
02:00:35,250 --> 02:00:36,083
And,

1788
02:00:36,210 --> 02:00:40,470
and so you know that that idea
of disruption is something that,

1789
02:00:40,530 --> 02:00:45,530
that I always liked that imagery of like
the journey across the Pacific Ocean,

1790
02:00:45,810 --> 02:00:50,580
born from something fundamentally
different and then really starting to turn

1791
02:00:50,581 --> 02:00:54,950
things over. Um, and so,
so when we say, okay,

1792
02:00:54,951 --> 02:00:59,951
what are we looking for right now in
terms of where do we think the new thunder

1793
02:01:00,171 --> 02:01:02,090
lizards will exist?

1794
02:01:02,780 --> 02:01:07,270
There's sort of two different areas
that comes back to the math that I,

1795
02:01:07,290 --> 02:01:08,870
that I'm really interested in.

1796
02:01:09,320 --> 02:01:14,320
One is I do think that artificial
intelligence is about to disrupt a lot of

1797
02:01:15,411 --> 02:01:19,490
different types of enterprise software.
Um,

1798
02:01:20,030 --> 02:01:22,670
I think that enterprise
software is still socks.

1799
02:01:23,090 --> 02:01:27,650
And if we're going to be able
to really transform the way,

1800
02:01:28,030 --> 02:01:32,000
um, uh, an, uh, business
has actually operated.

1801
02:01:32,150 --> 02:01:33,470
We have to take these,

1802
02:01:34,040 --> 02:01:39,040
the software that just basically records
data and spits it back out to you into

1803
02:01:39,471 --> 02:01:41,210
something that's actually
more intelligent,

1804
02:01:41,211 --> 02:01:43,550
that tells you something
that you didn't know,

1805
02:01:43,940 --> 02:01:47,470
that gives you superpowers.
And,

1806
02:01:47,480 --> 02:01:51,560
and I think that we're going to see
more and more of that in the industry.

1807
02:01:51,590 --> 02:01:54,200
And so as an example,
like baseline examples,

1808
02:01:54,470 --> 02:01:59,470
why do we spend millions of dollars on
oracle or net suite when the CFO is still

1809
02:02:02,211 --> 02:02:04,220
has to make a budget for next year?

1810
02:02:04,580 --> 02:02:09,580
Why does it that financial planning just
automatically automagically generate

1811
02:02:10,401 --> 02:02:12,950
itself based on all the
history that it knows,

1812
02:02:13,160 --> 02:02:15,440
plus all the data from the external world.

1813
02:02:15,860 --> 02:02:19,640
So I think things like that we're going
to start to see happen more and more.

1814
02:02:19,910 --> 02:02:24,680
I also think, you know, fundamentally
the scientific method may also be dead.

1815
02:02:24,710 --> 02:02:29,480
Like we list used to have the scientific
method is developed in a time where we

1816
02:02:29,481 --> 02:02:34,481
didn't have enough data and data was
actually the fundamental bottleneck in

1817
02:02:35,541 --> 02:02:38,540
scientific research.
Well that's just not the case anymore.

1818
02:02:38,930 --> 02:02:43,930
And so why is it that we form a hypothesis
then look at the data and then come

1819
02:02:44,661 --> 02:02:49,630
to a conclusion. We should have
all of the data then have, uh,

1820
02:02:50,120 --> 02:02:55,120
an analysis of that that leads us to a
hypothesis or a belief system that we

1821
02:02:56,251 --> 02:02:58,730
fundamentally test further.
Um,

1822
02:02:58,820 --> 02:03:03,050
so I think these massive
changes are coming and,

1823
02:03:03,380 --> 02:03:07,200
and you see it even in,
in cryptocurrency. Um,

1824
02:03:07,670 --> 02:03:11,810
there's also really
philosophical, interesting
debates happening around, well,

1825
02:03:11,811 --> 02:03:16,760
you have this massive pull towards
centralization, whether it's an AI and ml.

1826
02:03:16,761 --> 02:03:19,920
We have to have all of that data in
one place in order to really train

1827
02:03:20,130 --> 02:03:21,530
MLP machine learning,

1828
02:03:21,960 --> 02:03:24,990
machine learning, um,
or in cloud computing.

1829
02:03:24,991 --> 02:03:29,991
You're also putting it up into the
data and to more in data centers.

1830
02:03:30,540 --> 02:03:33,720
Um, in crypto currency, uh,

1831
02:03:33,721 --> 02:03:37,500
we believe that there's going to
be more decentralized software.

1832
02:03:37,890 --> 02:03:41,610
And so how do you reconcile
those two types of systems?

1833
02:03:41,611 --> 02:03:46,611
I think there's lots of really interesting
themes that are just at the start of

1834
02:03:48,031 --> 02:03:52,460
being discovered. Um, I'm
really excited about what,

1835
02:03:52,461 --> 02:03:57,300
what's going to happen with autonomous
vehicles and the technology that it's

1836
02:03:57,301 --> 02:04:00,330
going to be required to
make that a reality. Uh,

1837
02:04:00,331 --> 02:04:04,410
and so all of those areas I
think are just fascinating.

1838
02:04:04,440 --> 02:04:07,470
And so it feels like,
uh,

1839
02:04:07,650 --> 02:04:12,650
the period of real intellectual abundance
and that we're headed into a period of

1840
02:04:13,831 --> 02:04:16,320
real great creative energy

1841
02:04:17,720 --> 02:04:22,720
end up at a time where a lot of your
philosophical training and reading will be

1842
02:04:24,211 --> 02:04:28,920
put into practice in the real
world, right? Where we have,
yeah, if you look at the,

1843
02:04:28,921 --> 02:04:33,270
uh, people can look up the
trolley scenario or that is
typically thought of as a

1844
02:04:33,271 --> 02:04:37,530
thought exercise, but if you're
programming, not take too

1845
02:04:38,640 --> 02:04:39,600
off on a tangent,

1846
02:04:39,601 --> 02:04:44,601
but if you're programming for autonomous
vehicles and there's some type of act

1847
02:04:45,001 --> 02:04:46,370
of God off hailstorm,

1848
02:04:46,400 --> 02:04:49,920
a huge boulder falls in the middle of
the street and the car has to swerve left

1849
02:04:49,921 --> 02:04:54,900
and hit to school kids or swerve
right and hit five geriatrics.

1850
02:04:54,930 --> 02:04:56,820
And how does it make the decision?

1851
02:04:57,000 --> 02:05:01,530
What is the logic embedded
into that machine? It's,

1852
02:05:01,650 --> 02:05:04,920
it's uh,
really bring,

1853
02:05:04,921 --> 02:05:07,170
it takes a lot of these philosophy,

1854
02:05:07,171 --> 02:05:12,171
one o one thought exercises and translates
them very directly into the real

1855
02:05:12,571 --> 02:05:16,770
world with real consequences and is,
it is a fascinating time

1856
02:05:17,690 --> 02:05:21,890
and how much, it's also like how much do
you want to know? Right? So deep learning,

1857
02:05:22,190 --> 02:05:26,390
it's actually very difficult to know
what's happened inside of this black box.

1858
02:05:26,920 --> 02:05:29,840
And,
and so there's more of a demand for,

1859
02:05:30,170 --> 02:05:33,800
let's know what is actually happening.
This inside of this black box,

1860
02:05:33,801 --> 02:05:37,760
especially if lives that are risk or have
billions of dollars are at risk and we

1861
02:05:37,761 --> 02:05:41,960
need to be able to audit these, these
algorithms. I think there's real,

1862
02:05:41,990 --> 02:05:46,990
real interest in new technologies now
that we can actually audit and know what's

1863
02:05:47,301 --> 02:05:52,220
going on inside the box so that, you
know, if the, the trolley example happens,

1864
02:05:52,490 --> 02:05:55,340
we actually know how the machines
will make their decisions.

1865
02:05:55,341 --> 02:06:00,110
And so I think there's a lot of work
to be done, a lot of opportunity,

1866
02:06:00,440 --> 02:06:05,150
but also a lot of thought that needs to
go into how we want to regulate all of

1867
02:06:05,151 --> 02:06:05,984
this.

1868
02:06:06,380 --> 02:06:08,370
Tricky. Tricky, tricky. Yeah.

1869
02:06:09,830 --> 02:06:12,530
Well it's going to be
going to be exciting. Very,

1870
02:06:12,531 --> 02:06:15,920
very interested to see how all
these things coalesce. Right?

1871
02:06:15,921 --> 02:06:20,120
Also you're looking at these
gigantic companies, the
Facebooks googles, the fangs,

1872
02:06:20,150 --> 02:06:20,720
right?

1873
02:06:20,720 --> 02:06:25,720
That are more and more so
converging onto the same territory.

1874
02:06:26,180 --> 02:06:31,180
To see how that resolves if it does
in some fashion is also really,

1875
02:06:33,591 --> 02:06:34,550
really exciting to me.

1876
02:06:34,640 --> 02:06:38,000
Or how something like y Combinator just
to do a little bit of inside baseball

1877
02:06:38,001 --> 02:06:43,001
can say we are interested in this type
of company or this particular aspect of

1878
02:06:43,971 --> 02:06:48,971
engineering or fill in the blank and
it's kind of steer the attention of

1879
02:06:51,770 --> 02:06:55,760
thousands or tens of thousands of would
be entrepreneurs into a particular

1880
02:06:55,910 --> 02:07:00,910
sector or type of project is also just
really interesting to think about from

1881
02:07:01,840 --> 02:07:06,560
the the ramifications five years
down the line. Right. But anyway,

1882
02:07:06,860 --> 02:07:07,270
maybe

1883
02:07:07,270 --> 02:07:07,601
we have,

1884
02:07:07,601 --> 02:07:12,550
I mean like I think we have
so many incredible societal
problems that need to be

1885
02:07:12,551 --> 02:07:17,551
solved and I believe that the private
sector is most capable of solving these

1886
02:07:20,171 --> 02:07:21,430
problems,
right?

1887
02:07:21,431 --> 02:07:26,431
Whether it's energy or health or you know,

1888
02:07:26,710 --> 02:07:29,560
the fact that we have so much trash.
How do we solve that?

1889
02:07:29,561 --> 02:07:32,710
How do we get clean water to people?
Um,

1890
02:07:33,010 --> 02:07:37,840
it's not just about the next social
network and how do we deliver a better

1891
02:07:37,841 --> 02:07:42,190
advertising to people. But
you know, the, the beauty of,

1892
02:07:42,790 --> 02:07:47,790
of this type of entrepreneurship is that
there are huge societal problems that

1893
02:07:49,181 --> 02:07:53,810
still need to be solved.
That I think, you know, is,

1894
02:07:53,910 --> 02:07:58,910
is a really exciting opportunity also
to build great businesses around.

1895
02:07:59,680 --> 02:08:00,850
Uh,
and so I think that's,

1896
02:08:00,880 --> 02:08:05,800
that's also what gets me up in the morning
and makes me believe that that what

1897
02:08:05,801 --> 02:08:07,330
we're doing is important work.

1898
02:08:09,380 --> 02:08:10,460
Yeah,
it is important work.

1899
02:08:10,461 --> 02:08:14,390
I don't think that sort of collective
interest in self interest have to be

1900
02:08:16,150 --> 02:08:19,670
misaligned, right? They're not
mutually exclusive. You can,

1901
02:08:19,671 --> 02:08:24,671
you can solve and there's a long history
of solving public problems with private

1902
02:08:26,091 --> 02:08:29,930
sector technologies and companies.
Uh,

1903
02:08:30,140 --> 02:08:34,230
and let me just ask a new,
we, uh, we've gone a little
bit longer than expected, uh,

1904
02:08:34,280 --> 02:08:35,570
which I should have expected.

1905
02:08:37,300 --> 02:08:40,910
Let me ask you just a few more questions
and then we'll wrap up with where

1906
02:08:40,911 --> 02:08:45,590
people can find you and learn more about
what you're up to. Besides getting to,

1907
02:08:45,591 --> 02:08:46,424
yes.

1908
02:08:47,060 --> 02:08:52,060
Are there any books that you've given a
lot as gifts or re-read a lot yourself?

1909
02:08:56,080 --> 02:08:58,250
Oh Gosh. For me, you know,

1910
02:08:58,251 --> 02:09:01,680
right now there is,

1911
02:09:02,400 --> 02:09:06,680
there's a couple books that I think
are, are super interesting. So,

1912
02:09:07,130 --> 02:09:08,430
um, my, the,

1913
02:09:08,470 --> 02:09:13,470
my mentor Ted Denture Smith just wrote
a book called what school could be,

1914
02:09:15,200 --> 02:09:20,200
and this goes back to sort of education
as a critical societal question.

1915
02:09:23,230 --> 02:09:25,280
Um,
how do we fix education?

1916
02:09:25,281 --> 02:09:29,600
And what he did was he
went on a 50 state tour,

1917
02:09:29,990 --> 02:09:30,710
um,

1918
02:09:30,710 --> 02:09:35,710
to look at schools and discover that the
answers are actually already there and

1919
02:09:36,591 --> 02:09:40,670
are incredible school teachers throughout
our country are already finding

1920
02:09:40,671 --> 02:09:44,990
solutions to teaching our kids the most
important skills they need to have.

1921
02:09:45,380 --> 02:09:49,280
And I think reading that book
has not only given me hope,

1922
02:09:49,310 --> 02:09:54,310
but also a desire to see real change
in the public school education system.

1923
02:09:55,310 --> 02:09:56,143
Um,

1924
02:09:56,410 --> 02:10:00,410
but I think that's a really important
problem for all of us to actually engage

1925
02:10:00,411 --> 02:10:04,100
in. And so that's one book that I
would really push on to other people.

1926
02:10:04,880 --> 02:10:05,713
Um,

1927
02:10:06,170 --> 02:10:10,220
the other one that has completely
on the opposite end of the spectrum,

1928
02:10:10,221 --> 02:10:13,730
but it is a fiction book. It is, uh,

1929
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:18,080
by Khaled Hosseini, um,
who also wrote kite runner.

1930
02:10:18,650 --> 02:10:23,340
He wrote this book called a
thousand Splendid Suns and, uh,

1931
02:10:23,390 --> 02:10:28,390
probably one of the most beautiful books
that I've read in a long time in terms

1932
02:10:28,491 --> 02:10:29,720
of fiction writing.

1933
02:10:29,721 --> 02:10:34,340
And I would encourage people to read
it because it gives you sense of,

1934
02:10:34,970 --> 02:10:38,510
uh, Afghanistan's incredible history, um,

1935
02:10:38,540 --> 02:10:41,490
and the role women have played
within that history. And I,

1936
02:10:41,610 --> 02:10:45,980
I just loved that book because it just
was eyeopening to me in a very different

1937
02:10:45,981 --> 02:10:49,040
way. Um, so two very
different types of books.

1938
02:10:49,041 --> 02:10:51,530
None of them like straight
forward business books,

1939
02:10:51,531 --> 02:10:54,860
but ones that I think are meaningful
for our society to read today.

1940
02:10:55,360 --> 02:10:59,350
What school could be in
1000 splendid suns. Yeah.

1941
02:11:00,880 --> 02:11:05,770
Is there any purchase of $100 or
less? It's kind of arbitrary, right?

1942
02:11:05,771 --> 02:11:10,000
But just not a Bugatti or something that
has most positively impacted your life

1943
02:11:10,030 --> 02:11:13,030
or positively impacted
your life in recent memory.

1944
02:11:15,650 --> 02:11:16,440
Okay.

1945
02:11:16,440 --> 02:11:18,300
$100 or laugh.

1946
02:11:18,410 --> 02:11:20,120
Yeah, it could be. I mean, look, if it's,

1947
02:11:20,180 --> 02:11:23,930
if it's like a foldable Kayak that
you've got for 400 that's fine too.

1948
02:11:23,960 --> 02:11:26,240
But it could be, could be anything,
could be $2, could be free.

1949
02:11:26,241 --> 02:11:29,900
It could be any recent
addition to your life

1950
02:11:30,360 --> 02:11:34,690
that
it's actually a foldable chair.

1951
02:11:34,691 --> 02:11:39,070
So I go to my daughter's
soccer tournaments a lot
and there's this incredible

1952
02:11:39,071 --> 02:11:42,190
foldable chair. I don't know what
it's called. You can get it on Amazon,

1953
02:11:42,460 --> 02:11:47,460
but it has this flip over
sunshade that goes over your head.

1954
02:11:48,430 --> 02:11:53,430
And for any parent who has been
at a swim tournament or anything,

1955
02:11:54,100 --> 02:11:59,100
this is life changing because oftentimes
I'm just baking in the hot sun and you

1956
02:11:59,321 --> 02:12:03,940
can be anywhere and you have your own
personal tent that like folds over your

1957
02:12:03,941 --> 02:12:08,470
head. It's been, it's like
saved me on multiple weekends.

1958
02:12:08,471 --> 02:12:10,900
My husband bought two of them.
I love it.

1959
02:12:12,420 --> 02:12:15,540
Can you send me a link to that and
I'll put it in the show notes if, uh,

1960
02:12:15,820 --> 02:12:18,430
if you can track it down. So
for people wondering, I'll,

1961
02:12:18,431 --> 02:12:21,450
I'll put that in the show notes at Tim
Dot. Blog slash podcast and you can,

1962
02:12:21,630 --> 02:12:25,520
you can find this miraculous
foldable chair, uh,

1963
02:12:27,460 --> 02:12:32,460
if you could have a giant billboard
anywhere with anything on it.

1964
02:12:32,980 --> 02:12:37,030
So metaphorically speaking, getting up
a word, a quote, a message, a question,

1965
02:12:37,031 --> 02:12:40,510
anything out to millions or billions
of people can't be an advertisement.

1966
02:12:41,500 --> 02:12:44,140
What might you put on that billboard?

1967
02:12:45,020 --> 02:12:46,490
Wow.
Hmm.

1968
02:12:47,480 --> 02:12:51,650
I wonder if it's like not
losing does not equal winning.

1969
02:12:51,910 --> 02:12:56,540
So one of my, one of my themes
these days, I like that. Yeah.

1970
02:12:59,120 --> 02:13:02,540
And I think actually finding
your world class life,

1971
02:13:04,240 --> 02:13:05,980
it's probably the other one
that I would think about.

1972
02:13:07,720 --> 02:13:10,060
We'll give you find your
work worldclass life.

1973
02:13:10,510 --> 02:13:14,940
And I think the reason for that is to me,
everyone is capable of that.

1974
02:13:14,941 --> 02:13:18,690
And I think oftentimes we forget it.
And uh,

1975
02:13:19,770 --> 02:13:24,480
and it, for every person it's different.
That's the beauty of humanity. So

1976
02:13:26,110 --> 02:13:29,920
what do the characters for vehicle mean?

1977
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:36,690
Oh my gosh.
So it means it's a small round bell.

1978
02:13:37,860 --> 02:13:41,970
And the reason for my parents named me
that was they were originally going to

1979
02:13:41,971 --> 02:13:44,730
name me something more like,
you know,

1980
02:13:45,150 --> 02:13:49,920
really beautiful child or you know,
genius child.

1981
02:13:49,921 --> 02:13:54,540
And my mom, my mom took one look at
me when I was born and she's like, no,

1982
02:13:54,690 --> 02:13:58,860
none of those.
She said,

1983
02:13:59,100 --> 02:14:03,150
your face was so perfectly
round when you were born.

1984
02:14:03,180 --> 02:14:07,710
It reminded me of this
bike perfectly round bell.

1985
02:14:09,770 --> 02:14:10,410
And I'm like,

1986
02:14:10,410 --> 02:14:13,190
mom,
like all these other friends that I have,

1987
02:14:13,220 --> 02:14:16,520
especially Chinese friends
are like super intelligent,

1988
02:14:16,550 --> 02:14:20,660
like world class dominating
dictator for life.

1989
02:14:20,661 --> 02:14:25,460
CEO, child, you know,
and I'm like small bell.

1990
02:14:26,010 --> 02:14:28,680
Hi.
Are they coachable?

1991
02:14:30,360 --> 02:14:34,500
Uh,
and where can people find you online?

1992
02:14:34,501 --> 02:14:38,340
Say Hello.
Learn more about what you are up to.

1993
02:14:39,810 --> 02:14:44,490
I think professionally the best
place is to see my Twitter,

1994
02:14:44,550 --> 02:14:49,410
which is an a maniac, a n n, n, I, m.

1995
02:14:49,411 --> 02:14:51,370
A, n. I.

1996
02:14:51,370 --> 02:14:56,280
A C or a on Instagram.
It's a m.

1997
02:14:56,281 --> 02:14:59,850
I you are a,
you'll see more of my life there.

1998
02:15:00,010 --> 02:15:04,640
Amy Muda. Yes. Three bays.
Is that what that means?

1999
02:15:04,641 --> 02:15:08,750
Muda something like that
maybe. Yeah. So Twitter,

2000
02:15:09,230 --> 02:15:10,340
Twitter,
and a maniac.

2001
02:15:10,370 --> 02:15:15,370
Instagram a Muda m I you
are a and best website,

2002
02:15:18,080 --> 02:15:21,130
floodgate,
floodgate.com.

2003
02:15:21,390 --> 02:15:25,540
[inaudible] dot Com why flood gate?
What is a flood gate?

2004
02:15:26,380 --> 02:15:28,190
Why, why is it called the floodgate? Yeah.

2005
02:15:28,670 --> 02:15:33,670
Yeah. Cause we think we're
at the forefront of like the,

2006
02:15:33,671 --> 02:15:38,480
the headwaters of, of
innovation and so, and,

2007
02:15:38,481 --> 02:15:41,450
and, and it sounded, I don't know,

2008
02:15:41,510 --> 02:15:43,520
kind of big and audacious

2009
02:15:45,610 --> 02:15:50,170
good enough reason.
A audacious,

2010
02:15:50,350 --> 02:15:54,070
audacious, yes. Uh, audacious,

2011
02:15:54,100 --> 02:15:58,660
aggressive but still the mother of
dragons, there is a nurturing mother.

2012
02:15:58,661 --> 02:16:03,120
Like there is den mother quality to him,

2013
02:16:03,720 --> 02:16:07,470
the Mama Bear, you know,
I'll, I'm very protective,

2014
02:16:07,471 --> 02:16:12,471
but also I'm going to push my kids and
the people around me to be the best they

2015
02:16:12,661 --> 02:16:13,494
can be.

2016
02:16:13,850 --> 02:16:18,130
Just don't get in. Don't get in
between the mother and the cub.

2017
02:16:18,600 --> 02:16:21,710
Good guideline. And I will say
for anybody who's wondering,

2018
02:16:21,711 --> 02:16:26,711
what would it be like to just go sort
of motto Amano with an I would say,

2019
02:16:27,620 --> 02:16:27,810
you know,

2020
02:16:27,810 --> 02:16:32,440
you're one of the few people I would
put Sam Harris in this category where if

2021
02:16:32,441 --> 02:16:35,620
you, if you are willing to
engage in at like eight,

2022
02:16:35,890 --> 02:16:37,930
eight public debate with either of you,

2023
02:16:37,931 --> 02:16:41,170
you just have to make sure that you have
practice defending it against having

2024
02:16:41,171 --> 02:16:46,171
your face ripped off and like the most
logical complimentary way possible.

2025
02:16:48,040 --> 02:16:50,800
Uh, I've just very impressed
by you and, and I've,

2026
02:16:50,860 --> 02:16:55,860
I've really wanted to have you on the
show for a long time and I'm thrilled that

2027
02:16:56,320 --> 02:17:01,320
you were willing to carve out a few hours
to spend chatting and it's always fun

2028
02:17:02,501 --> 02:17:03,334
chatting.

2029
02:17:03,760 --> 02:17:07,830
It's always fun. Tim, you, you've been
there from the very get go. You were,

2030
02:17:07,831 --> 02:17:11,640
you were the person behind my very
first investment in task rabbit,

2031
02:17:11,641 --> 02:17:14,220
so I have a lot to thank
you for it as well.

2032
02:17:15,090 --> 02:17:19,350
Well, the, the adventure shall
continue and I will certainly, I'm not,

2033
02:17:19,351 --> 02:17:22,800
I'm not as involved as I
used to be in the tech scene,

2034
02:17:22,801 --> 02:17:24,450
but I'll be cheering from the sidelines.

2035
02:17:24,640 --> 02:17:29,190
Is there anything else that you'd
like to say or suggest or mention?

2036
02:17:29,220 --> 02:17:31,320
Any parting words before we wrap up?

2037
02:17:33,010 --> 02:17:36,940
No, I hope the, the, your audience, uh,

2038
02:17:36,950 --> 02:17:40,240
enjoyed this and if they got
anything out of it that they,

2039
02:17:40,840 --> 02:17:42,040
if they want to contact me,

2040
02:17:42,041 --> 02:17:47,041
I'm always open to more conversations
and a hope that some of my story shows

2041
02:17:48,551 --> 02:17:52,570
that even if people tell you you
can't do something that, that you can,

2042
02:17:53,610 --> 02:17:57,870
Ken indeed just got to spend the
summer reading up on those 12 topics.

2043
02:17:58,400 --> 02:18:01,680
That's right. You would can't
always out talent everyone,

2044
02:18:01,710 --> 02:18:06,040
but if you out prepare them, you might
as well have out talented them. Maybe

2045
02:18:06,060 --> 02:18:09,760
the billboard sign,
his effort matters effort really does.

2046
02:18:09,970 --> 02:18:14,410
It does. Uh, well Ann, thank
you so much again. This is a,

2047
02:18:14,411 --> 02:18:16,510
this has been such a treat and a,

2048
02:18:16,511 --> 02:18:21,511
and a gift and I look forward to
hearing what people have to say on the,

2049
02:18:22,451 --> 02:18:27,310
on the interwebs. And perhaps we'll
do a round two in person, uh, during,

2050
02:18:27,400 --> 02:18:32,290
during one of, what was the name of the,
uh, was it the Tim Ferris wine hour?

2051
02:18:32,291 --> 02:18:36,690
What was, what was the true, yeah,

2052
02:18:39,110 --> 02:18:41,000
they call it Ferris time.

2053
02:18:41,310 --> 02:18:44,630
That's a Mike calls it Ferris time,

2054
02:18:44,730 --> 02:18:47,550
which was the, uh, yeah,
the little little wine,

2055
02:18:47,680 --> 02:18:51,810
a pair of TIF to smooth out the
edges that we could describe it.

2056
02:18:51,850 --> 02:18:55,100
He just grabs, he just grabbed the glass
and it's like, I think it's fair sour.

2057
02:18:57,790 --> 02:19:01,600
I'll take it. I will take it. Uh, and uh,

2058
02:19:02,270 --> 02:19:04,900
and I will talk to you
soon. See you soon. I hope.

2059
02:19:05,380 --> 02:19:08,320

we discussed, the books,

from me every Friday that provides a

2068
02:19:40,011 --> 02:19:43,550
little more soul of fun before the
weekend and five bullet Friday is a very

2069
02:19:43,551 --> 02:19:47,900
short email where I share the coolest
things I've found or that I've been

2070
02:19:47,901 --> 02:19:49,220
pondering over the week.

2071
02:19:49,430 --> 02:19:52,190
That could include favorite new
albums that I've discovered.

2072
02:19:52,191 --> 02:19:55,640
It could include Gizmos and gadgets
and all sorts of weird shit that I've

2073
02:19:55,641 --> 02:19:59,960
somehow dug up in the other
world of the esoteric as I do.

2074
02:20:00,260 --> 02:20:05,260
It could include favorite articles that
I've read and that I've shared with my

2075
02:20:05,901 --> 02:20:08,630
close friends, for instance,
and it's very short.

2076
02:20:08,720 --> 02:20:13,670
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness
before you head off for the weekend,

so if you want to receive that,

2080

I hope you enjoyed, this episode
is brought to you by legal zoom,

2081
02:20:29,900 --> 02:20:33,320
which more than 2 million Americans have
used to help start their businesses.

2082
02:20:33,710 --> 02:20:37,820
Past guests, even such as,
well. Wordpress lead developer,

2083
02:20:37,821 --> 02:20:42,080
CEO of Automattic, Matt Mullen leg, now
valued at more than a billion dollars,

2084
02:20:42,081 --> 02:20:44,660
have used legal zoom to help
with their business leads,

2085
02:20:44,661 --> 02:20:46,790
specifically in his case
to form his company,

2086
02:20:46,791 --> 02:20:49,880
but legal zoom isn't just
for launching your business.

2087
02:20:49,920 --> 02:20:53,990
Their services include everything from
helping you to manage changing tax laws,

2088
02:20:53,991 --> 02:20:58,520
reviewing contracts, creating Ndas,
nondisclosure agreements, important stuff,

2089
02:20:58,730 --> 02:21:03,410
handling lease agreements and assisting
with really any other legal challenge,

2090
02:21:03,411 --> 02:21:07,820
hurdle, inconvenience that typically takes
time and effort away from running your

2091
02:21:07,821 --> 02:21:08,654
business.

2092
02:21:08,690 --> 02:21:12,110
The best part is that you
won't get charged by the
hour because legal zoom isn't

2093
02:21:12,170 --> 02:21:12,801
a law firm,

2094
02:21:12,801 --> 02:21:17,801
so they won't be running the clock up
and spinning circles just to raise your

2095
02:21:18,290 --> 02:21:19,550
bill.
Instead,

2096
02:21:19,551 --> 02:21:23,150
they just ask you to pay one low upfront
price for whatever it is that you're

2097
02:21:23,151 --> 02:21:24,530
looking to get all the card style.

2098
02:21:24,950 --> 02:21:29,240

their business section for all of their

2099
02:21:29,241 --> 02:21:31,760
services.
And if you want special savings,

2100
02:21:32,600 --> 02:21:35,870
that's the terminology in
the copy that they suggest.

2101
02:21:36,080 --> 02:21:39,830
I don't know what the special savings
is folks, but it's titillating.

2102
02:21:39,831 --> 02:21:41,150
