1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,870
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02,871 --> 00:00:06,230
I can run flat out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,640
I'm a cybernetic organism.

4
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,380
This episode is brought
to you by four sigmatic.

5
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:30,230
You might remember four sigmatic
for their mushroom coffee,

6
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,020
which was created by those
clever finish founders.

7
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:35,870
And when I first mentioned
that coffee on this podcast,

8
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:39,350
the product sold out in less than a week.
It lights you up like a Christmas tree,

9
00:00:39,351 --> 00:00:41,870
which can be really useful.
However,

10
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:46,310
recently I've been testing the opposite
side of the spectrum of new product and

11
00:00:46,311 --> 00:00:51,140
that is their Reishi mushroom elixir
to help me end my day to get to sleep.

12
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:54,050
As you guys may know,
longtime listeners,

13
00:00:54,051 --> 00:00:57,740
at least I struggled with insomnia for
decades. I have a largely fixed that,

14
00:00:57,741 --> 00:01:00,860
but still shutting off my monkey
brain has never been easy,

15
00:01:00,861 --> 00:01:03,570
still isn't easy very
often and I found Reishi,

16
00:01:03,571 --> 00:01:06,950
which had been fascinated by for
a few years now, has been very,

17
00:01:06,951 --> 00:01:10,880
very effective and calming
their old formula. However,

18
00:01:10,881 --> 00:01:15,800
four sigmatic old formula included
Stevia and I like to avoid sweeteners,

19
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:18,590
all sweeteners for a host of reasons,

20
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:22,610
and I then just ping them and asked,
hey guys,

21
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:26,330
I would love to experiment with
this and maybe actually suggested,

22
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,780
but I'd like a version without
sweeteners if he'd be open to it.

23
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,070
If too much of a headache,
don't worry.

24
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:35,210
And they are always game
for experimentation.

25
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,930
So they created a special custom version
without the Stevia, without sweeteners.

26
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,480
Now it is part of my nightly routine.

27
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,600
Their ratio looks comes
in single serving packets,

28
00:01:44,601 --> 00:01:47,570
which are perfect for travel and in fact
I'm about to leave the country right

29
00:01:47,571 --> 00:01:51,410
now and I have a packet in front of me
that's just going to sit in the end of my

30
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:55,940
carry on bag.
You only need hot water and it mixes very,

31
00:01:55,941 --> 00:01:56,774
very easily.

32
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:01,370
Here's some recommended copy
that they put in the read,

33
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:05,150
so I'm going to read it and then I'll
give you my take quote, a warning.

34
00:02:05,151 --> 00:02:06,680
For those in the experimental mindset,

35
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:10,220
Reishi is strong and bitter in
parentheses like any great medicine.

36
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,750
So if the bitterness is too much,

37
00:02:11,751 --> 00:02:16,100
I recommend trying it with honey end or
nut milk such as almond milk and quote.

38
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,260
So I'm going to say,
no,

39
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:22,790
you should suck it up and you should drink
the tea because it's not that bitter.

40
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:26,990
And maybe should take the advice of all
Chinese people when they're criticizing

41
00:02:26,991 --> 00:02:29,510
younguns. When they say
Boone, unsure. Cool.

42
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:34,460
Which means you're not able to eat
bitterness. Bitter is in many cases,

43
00:02:34,461 --> 00:02:38,060
an indication of things that help
liver detoxification and so on.

44
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,860
Not saying that's the case here,

45
00:02:39,861 --> 00:02:44,630
but I've tested this ratio
lecture on family members,

46
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:48,470
on friends. Everybody has liked it. It's
a little bit earthy. It's not that hard.

47
00:02:48,471 --> 00:02:50,960
So I would just say suck it up and no,

48
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:55,130
don't put in honey or milk or any of
that shit. Just drink the goddamn tea.

49
00:02:55,131 --> 00:02:58,220
It's delicious, I think. Right? If
you like poo air, that kind of stuff,

50
00:02:58,221 --> 00:03:01,780
that type of tea, you're going
to dig it. So just try it. Okay.

51
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:05,860
Back to then my read. If you'd like
to naturally improve your sleep,

52
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:07,780
both onset and quality,

53
00:03:07,781 --> 00:03:12,781
I think naturally you might just
enjoy this reishi elixir without any

54
00:03:13,061 --> 00:03:17,530
sweeteners. It has organic, Reishi
extract, organic fueled, mint extract,

55
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:22,030
organic rose hips extract, organic
Tulsi extract. And that's it.

56
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:27,190
No fancy stuff, no artificial watching
McCall at anything. So check it out.

69
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:24,770
This episode is brought to you
by Athletic Greens every year.

70
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,320
Of course people look for
new ways to become healthier,

71
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:30,830
to take their fitness and so
on to the next level. For me,

72
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:35,090
step number one is having some
form of nutritional insurance.

73
00:04:35,091 --> 00:04:38,900
That's how I would look at it and the
nutritional insurance needs to make sure

74
00:04:38,901 --> 00:04:41,630
all of my basic needs are met.

75
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:46,220
All the boxes checked regardless of
travel schedule, missed meals and so on.

76
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:50,210
They're going to be times in the new
year when your diet and exercise will get

77
00:04:50,211 --> 00:04:54,890
interrupted. Life will interrupt it in
during those times. You want a safety net.

78
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:58,310
I get asked all the time, if you could
only use one supplement, what would it be?

79
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:01,190
And my answer is
inevitably Athletic Greens,

80
00:05:01,191 --> 00:05:03,710
it is your all in one
nutritional insurance.

81
00:05:03,711 --> 00:05:05,450
I recommended it in the four hour body,

82
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:09,440
did not get paid for that and I
travel with it to avoid getting sick.

83
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:12,470
I take it in the mornings to
ensure optimal performance.

84
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,940
It just covers all my basis.

85
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:17,960
If I can't get what I need through whole
food meals throughout the rest of the

86
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,390
day.

leaves me with less to worry about if,

91

Hello Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls.

95
00:05:51,461 --> 00:05:54,940
And welcome to another episode of the Tim
Ferriss Show where it is always my job,

96
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,120
each and every episode to interview
world performers and experts,

97
00:05:59,121 --> 00:06:00,320
leaders in all fields,

98
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:05,090
and that ranges from amazing athletes to
military personnel to chess prodigies,

99
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,360
to famous investors. And
beyond. In this episode,

100
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:11,450
we're going to set a new
podcast record for this show,

101
00:06:11,451 --> 00:06:14,180
at least with five different guests.

102
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,990
These are people that I have
interviewed remotely and uh,

103
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:22,550
this episode today features Adam Robinson,
Debbie Millman,

104
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:26,300
Neil Strauss, Scott Belsky,
and Veronica Belmont.

105
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:29,420
These are all people who are,

106
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:34,340
I consider the best at what they do or
at least one of the best in the world at

107
00:06:34,341 --> 00:06:39,200
the many things that they do. And that
of course includes investing, chess,

108
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:43,460
graphic design, writing
tech, and much, much more.

109
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:48,260
This particular round table discussion
covers topics pose to all of them,

110
00:06:48,261 --> 00:06:51,470
questions posed to all of them,
including best investments,

111
00:06:51,471 --> 00:06:53,030
what are the best investments
they've ever made,

112
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:56,240
what are their favorite failures?
In other words,

113
00:06:56,241 --> 00:07:00,680
failures that have led to later successes
and bad recommendations in their areas

114
00:07:00,681 --> 00:07:03,170
of expertise that you should avoid.

115
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:08,230
This is a composite episode which many
of you have requested explicitly because

116
00:07:08,811 --> 00:07:13,610
you wanna be able to see the patterns
and each guest offers a lot of actionable

117
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,370
life advice.
So without further ado,

118
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:21,540
please give a listen and I hope you
enjoy this as much as I did. Okay.

119
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:25,800
Our guest today is Adam Robinson.

120
00:07:25,801 --> 00:07:30,801
You
can
find
them
on
twitter@iamadamrobinsonoratrobinsonglobalstrategies.com

121
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:37,050
Adam has made a lifelong
study of outflanking and
outsmarting the competition.

122
00:07:37,051 --> 00:07:41,940
He has rated chess master and has been
awarded a life master title by the United

123
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,560
States Chess Federation as a teenager.

124
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:47,640
He was personally mentored by Bobby
Fisher in the 18 months leading up to his

125
00:07:47,641 --> 00:07:48,810
winning the world championship.

126
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:53,430
And Adam and I talked a lot about this
in our first conversation on the Tim

127
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:56,550
Ferriss show that you guys can check out.
But back to the bio.

128
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,860
Then in Adam's first career,

129
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:02,880
he developed a revolutionary approach to
taking standardized tests as one of the

130
00:08:02,881 --> 00:08:05,070
two original cofounders
of the Princeton Review,

131
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:09,450
his paradigm breaking or category killing
as they in publishing test prep book

132
00:08:09,451 --> 00:08:10,470
cracking the system.

133
00:08:10,471 --> 00:08:14,340
The sat is the only test prep book
to have ever become a New York Times

134
00:08:14,341 --> 00:08:17,190
bestseller. After selling his
interest in the Princeton Review,

135
00:08:17,191 --> 00:08:20,460
Adam turned his attention in the early
nineties to the then emerging field of

136
00:08:20,461 --> 00:08:24,060
artificial intelligence developing a
program that could analyze texts and

137
00:08:24,061 --> 00:08:25,650
provide human like commentary.

138
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:29,730
He was later invited to join a well
known quant fund to develop statistical

139
00:08:29,731 --> 00:08:33,990
trading models and since he's established
himself as an independent global macro

140
00:08:33,991 --> 00:08:37,590
advisor to the chief investment officers
of a select group of the world's most

141
00:08:37,591 --> 00:08:41,370
successful hedge funds and ultra
high net worth family offices.

142
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:49,120
What are bad recommendations that you
hear in your profession or area of

143
00:08:49,121 --> 00:08:49,954
expertise?

144
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:56,280
My field is that of global finance
and virtually all have been told

145
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:01,350
when they were younger or implicitly
belief or tacitly encouraged to do so.

146
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:06,000
But the cookie cutter curriculum is a
business schools. They all attend that.

147
00:09:06,001 --> 00:09:10,200
The more they understand the world,
the better their investment results.

148
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:11,700
It makes sense,
doesn't it?

149
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:15,420
The more information we acquire
an evaluate the air quotes,

150
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:18,780
better informed we become
and the better our decisions.

151
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:23,340
Accumulating information becoming better
informed is certainly an advantage in

152
00:09:23,341 --> 00:09:28,140
numerous, if not most fields, but not in
the counterintuitive world of investing.

153
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,950
We're accumulating information can
actually hurt your investment results.

154
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:35,040
So in 1974 Paul Slovic,

155
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:39,390
a worldclass psychologist and a pure
of Nobel laureate, Daniel Kahneman,

156
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:43,080
decided to evaluate the effect of
information on decision making.

157
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:46,590
This study should be taught at every
business school in the country.

158
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,730
Slavic gathered eight professional course
handicappers and announced to them,

159
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,020
I want to see how well you predict
the winners of horse races. Now,

160
00:09:55,021 --> 00:09:59,190
these handicappers were all seasoned
professionals who made their living solely

161
00:09:59,191 --> 00:10:01,740
on their gambling skills,
so love it.

162
00:10:01,741 --> 00:10:05,520
Told them the test would consist of
predicting 40 horse races in four

163
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:08,280
consecutive rounds in the first round.

164
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:12,480
Each gambler would be given the five
pieces of information he wanted on each

165
00:10:12,481 --> 00:10:16,920
horse, which would vary from handicapper
to handicapper. One handicap,

166
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,960
for example,
it might want the years of experience.

167
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:21,600
The jockey has had his one
of his top five variables,

168
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:24,000
while another might not
care at all about that,

169
00:10:24,001 --> 00:10:27,690
but want the fastest speed for any given
a horse that achieved in the past year

170
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,380
or the weight of the jockey or whatever.
Finally,

171
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:35,100
in addition to asking the handicappers
to predict the winner of each race,

172
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:39,960
he asked each one to also state how
confident he was in his prediction.

173
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,430
Now, as it turns out, there were an
average of 10 horses in each race,

174
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,100
so we would expect by blind chance,

175
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:51,810
random guessing that each handicapper
would be right 10% of the time at that,

176
00:10:51,811 --> 00:10:56,730
their confidence with a blind
guests to be 10% so in round one,

177
00:10:56,731 --> 00:11:00,480
let's see how they did with
just five pieces of information.

178
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:04,260
The handicappers where 17% accurate,
which is pretty good,

179
00:11:04,261 --> 00:11:09,261
actually 70% better than the 10% chance
they started with given zero pieces of

180
00:11:09,631 --> 00:11:11,970
information.
And interestingly,

181
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
their confidence with 19% almost exactly
as confident as they should have been.

182
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:21,780
They were 17% accurate in 19%
confident in their predictions.

183
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:27,050
Excellent calibration in round two they
were then given 10 pieces of information

184
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:31,260
in round three 20 and in
the fourth and final round,

185
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:34,650
each handicapper was given
40 pieces of information.

186
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:39,240
That's a whole lot more statistics than
the five pieces of information they each

187
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:41,520
started with.
Surprisingly,

188
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:46,790
their accuracy had flatlined at 17%
they were no more accurate with the

189
00:11:47,131 --> 00:11:51,750
additional 35 pieces of information
they had. Unfortunately,

190
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:56,900
their confidence in their predictions
had nearly doubled to 31% so the

191
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:01,900
additional information made them no more
accurate but a whole lot more confident,

192
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,290
which would have led them to increase
the size of their bets and lose money.

193
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:09,640
As a result,
beyond a certain amount of information,

194
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:10,990
certain minimal amount,

195
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:15,820
additional information only
feeds confirmation bias.

196
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:20,440
Leaving aside the considerable costs
and delay occasioned in acquiring that

197
00:12:20,441 --> 00:12:21,274
information.

198
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:25,500
The additional information we gained that
conflicts with our original assessment

199
00:12:25,501 --> 00:12:29,850
or conclusion we conveniently ignore
or dismiss while the information that

200
00:12:29,851 --> 00:12:34,170
confirms our original decision makes us
increasingly certain that our conclusion

201
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:36,990
was correct.
So to return to investing.

202
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:41,910
The second problem with
trying to understand the world
is that is simply far too

203
00:12:41,911 --> 00:12:45,870
complex to grasp and the more dog at
our attempts to understand the world,

204
00:12:45,871 --> 00:12:49,320
the more earnestly we want
to explain that's air quotes,

205
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:51,060
explain events and trends in it.

206
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,960
The more we become attached
to our resulting beliefs,

207
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,960
which are almost always
more or less mistaken,

208
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:02,280
blinding us to the financial trends that
are actually unfolding right in front

209
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:05,160
of our eyes. Worse, we think
we understand the world,

210
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:09,750
giving us a false sense of confidence
when in fact we are almost always more or

211
00:13:09,751 --> 00:13:10,830
less mistaken.

212
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:15,600
You hear all the time from even the most
seasoned investors and financial expert

213
00:13:15,601 --> 00:13:17,880
that this trend or that
doesn't make sense.

214
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:22,140
It doesn't make sense for the dollar keeps
going lower or it makes no sense that

215
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,570
stock's keep going higher.

216
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:28,950
But what's really going on when investors
say that something makes no sense is

217
00:13:28,951 --> 00:13:33,240
that they have a dozen or whatever reasons
why the trend should be moving in the

218
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:36,390
opposite direction. Yet it keeps
moving in the current direction.

219
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:40,950
So they believe the trend
air quotes makes no sense,

220
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,590
but what makes no sense is
their model of the world.

221
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,770
That's what doesn't make sense.
The world always makes sense.

222
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,920
We just don't understand it.
In fact,

223
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:54,030
because financial trends involve human
behavior and human beliefs on a global

224
00:13:54,031 --> 00:13:54,864
scale,

225
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:58,410
the most powerful trends won't make
sense until it becomes too late to profit

226
00:13:58,411 --> 00:14:02,670
from them. By the time investors
formulate and understanding, again,

227
00:14:02,671 --> 00:14:06,510
a false understanding that gives them
the feeling of confidence to invest.

228
00:14:06,511 --> 00:14:10,170
The investment opportunity
has likely already past.

229
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:15,030
So when I hear sophisticated investors or
financial commentators say for example,

230
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:19,110
that it makes no sense how energy stocks
keep going lower and know that energy

231
00:14:19,111 --> 00:14:22,980
stocks have a lot lower to go because
all those investors are on the wrong side

232
00:14:22,981 --> 00:14:24,660
of the trade in denial,

233
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,500
probably doubling down on their
original decision to buy energy stocks.

234
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:32,100
Eventually there'll be forced to throw
in the towel and have to sell those

235
00:14:32,101 --> 00:14:34,560
energy stocks.
Driving prices still lower.

236
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,790
What is one of the best or most
worthwhile investments you've ever made?

237
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:46,190
I've made many investments in my
life. If money of time, of energy,

238
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,680
of passion and emotion,

239
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:53,390
and one of the best payoffs for the
invested was learning to meditate.

240
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,990
I've always been driven,
excited by the world,

241
00:14:56,991 --> 00:15:01,460
so my mind is continually racing at a
thousand miles per hour pursuing this

242
00:15:01,461 --> 00:15:06,461
question or that creating this system
or that nonstop 24 hours a day,

243
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:11,060
365 days a year,
366 on leap years.

244
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:15,650
Now all that nonstop mental and psychic
stimulation gets exhausting of course,

245
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,770
and if you want to perform
optimally at anything,

246
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,520
you need to find a way to recover
from the stresses of that activity.

247
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:28,130
So I knew that though I should find a
way to turn off my mind and air quotes,

248
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,180
just relax.
Justin joy just be.

249
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:37,700
For years I had failed to find
a way. I tried everything. Yoga,

250
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:40,580
exercise.
I even tried hypnosis.

251
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:46,420
I research once the best hypnotist in New
York City as a way to somehow turn off

252
00:15:47,421 --> 00:15:48,590
my hyperactive mind,

253
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:52,820
but after four attempted and usually
expensive sessions with this guy,

254
00:15:52,821 --> 00:15:57,410
the hypnotist gave up saying, your mind
is too active to submit to the hypnosis.

255
00:15:57,411 --> 00:16:00,350
What's the thanks a lot dark.
I told them not concealing my annoyance.

256
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:05,030
That's exactly why I had come to him.
Then about two years ago,

257
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:06,470
my best g Josh Waitzkin,

258
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:11,500
recognizing that I couldn't unwind or
disengage from my relentless analyzing the

259
00:16:12,051 --> 00:16:16,550
world, especially in the financial world,
recommended that I take up meditation.

260
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,890
Sorry,
I said it doesn't work for me.

261
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:22,820
I can't sit still long enough for any
benefits of meditating to kick in.

262
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,320
So he asked, have you ever tried
heart rate variability training,

263
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,070
HRV training? And I said, no. What's that?

264
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:36,430
He said that you just focused on your
breathing using biofeedback to measure the

265
00:16:36,651 --> 00:16:39,500
smoothness and the amplitude.

266
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,590
Hence the word variability
of your heart rate.

267
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:45,890
The heart not surprisingly,

268
00:16:45,891 --> 00:16:49,280
registers all our realtime
emotions and stresses.

269
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:53,600
So the normal heartbeat is highly erratic
staying within a tight band around an

270
00:16:53,601 --> 00:16:54,434
average.

271
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,820
The goal with the VI biofeedback training
is to gain control over your own heart

272
00:16:58,821 --> 00:17:00,590
rate by focusing on your breathing,

273
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:04,760
making your Jagat heart rate's
smooth out like a sine curve,

274
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,360
and to widen its amplitude.
That sounded interesting,

275
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:11,960
but it wasn't until I reframed
meditation that I submitted a trying it.

276
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:17,270
The problem with meditation I thought
was that it wasn't practical and worse.

277
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:21,080
The time I spent meditating was Tom.
I could've spent analyzing the world,

278
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:25,730
but I eventually reframe meditation
as a way to relinquish control of my

279
00:17:25,731 --> 00:17:30,731
conscious mind so that my more powerful
unconscious mind could take over and my

280
00:17:31,101 --> 00:17:35,240
analysis of the world would improve.
Motivated by that reframing.

281
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:38,420
I enthusiastically adopted biofeedback,

282
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:43,450
HRV training and in a few weeks learn to
quiet my mind after just a single deep

283
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:48,830
diaphragm belly breath,
getting the ability to achieve
a zen like calm on demand.

284
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:50,100
Now,

285
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,700
whenever I need to detach from the world
or from the stresses of daily life and

286
00:17:53,701 --> 00:17:55,440
to allow my mind arrest,

287
00:17:55,770 --> 00:18:00,770
I simply get centered and inhale from my
diaphragm and I do so numerous times a

288
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:04,860
day, a minute here, a minute there,
and at least once a day I waste.

289
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:05,700
That's air quotes.

290
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:10,080
I waste a larger 15 to 20 minute
block of time meditating in this way,

291
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,180
but it's not wasted time.
Of course,

292
00:18:12,181 --> 00:18:17,181
since the increased creativity and
productivity from these mini restorative

293
00:18:17,491 --> 00:18:18,324
sessions,

294
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:23,760
it's far more valuable than the
time I spend being unproductive.

295
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:29,160
Again, air quotes while meditating,
meditation is one of the most practical,

296
00:18:29,161 --> 00:18:34,161
powerful productivity enhancing tools
ever created and learning to meditate is

297
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:36,420
one of the best
investments I've ever made.

298
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:44,720
Today's guest is Debbie Millman,
one of my favorite people,

299
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:48,890
Debbie Millman at Debbie Millman
on Twitter and Instagram.

300
00:18:48,891 --> 00:18:53,810
So please say hello and Debbie millman.com
she has been called one of the most

301
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,350
influential designers working
today by graphic design USA.

302
00:18:57,351 --> 00:18:59,780
She is the founder and
host of design matters,

303
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:03,590
the world's first and longest running
podcast about design where she's

304
00:19:03,591 --> 00:19:08,030
interviewed nearly 300 design luminaries
and cultural commentators including

305
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,760
Mossimo,
Vin Yeley and Milton Glaser.

306
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:14,510
Her artwork has been exhibited around
the world and she's designed everything

307
00:19:14,511 --> 00:19:18,680
from wrapping paper to beach towels,
greeting cards to playing cards,

308
00:19:18,681 --> 00:19:23,240
notebooks to tee shirts and star wars
merchandise to Global Burger King

309
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,920
rebrands.
She's done everything.

310
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:28,640
Debby is the president emeritus of a IGA,

311
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:32,420
one of only five women to
hold the position and the
organization's hundred year

312
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:33,230
history,

313
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:37,370
the editorial and creative director of
print magazine and the author of six

314
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,990
books in 2009 Debbie cofounded
alongside Steven Heller,

315
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:46,220
the world's first masters program in
branding at the school of visual arts in

316
00:19:46,221 --> 00:19:49,490
New York City,
which has received international acclaim.

317
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,620
Debbie is brilliant.

318
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:56,920
She is one of the sweetest humans
I know Andy has taught me so,

319
00:19:57,261 --> 00:20:01,760
so much including as you will learn,
busy is a decision.

320
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:02,780
So without further ado,

321
00:20:02,781 --> 00:20:07,550
please enjoy the ever interesting
and insightful Debbie Millman.

322
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:16,560
How has a failure or apparent
failure set you up for later success?

323
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:21,060
Do you have a favorite
failure and quote of yours?

324
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,600
Oh, Tim, I have so many failures.

325
00:20:24,601 --> 00:20:28,110
I think the first decade of my
career were experiments and failure,

326
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:31,800
rejection and humiliation,
but I do have a favorite,

327
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,420
so I will share that.

328
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:38,900
In early 2003 a good friend sent me an
email with a subject line that red begin

329
00:20:40,861 --> 00:20:45,861
drinking heavily before opening the
email contained a link to a blog titled

330
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,733
Speak Up.

331
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:52,780
The first ever online forum about
graphic design and branding in the world

332
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:56,230
suddenly sprawled before my eyes.

333
00:20:56,260 --> 00:21:01,240
I found myself reading an article
that disparaged my entire career.

334
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:06,880
This particular incident in tandem with
a number of historical rejections and

335
00:21:06,881 --> 00:21:11,881
setbacks and humiliations sent me into
a really deep depression and I seriously

336
00:21:13,361 --> 00:21:17,830
considered leaving the design
profession altogether. However,

337
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:21,550
however,
in the 14 years since this occurred,

338
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:26,830
this utter takedown of everything I'd
done to date and everything I thought was

339
00:21:26,831 --> 00:21:29,440
a complete and total failure for a long,

340
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:34,680
long time ultimately transformed into
the foundation of everything I've done

341
00:21:35,561 --> 00:21:36,394
since.

342
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:41,700
Everything I am doing now contains
the seeds of origin from that time.

343
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:48,270
So it turns out for me the
worst professional experience
I've faced ultimately

344
00:21:49,781 --> 00:21:54,781
became the most important
defining experience of my life.

345
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,380
What is one of the best or most
worthwhile investments you've ever made?

346
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:05,500
This answer might
surprise you or maybe not,

347
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:09,940
but the best investment I've
ever made was in psychotherapy.

348
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:11,500
When I first started,

349
00:22:11,501 --> 00:22:16,501
I was in my early thirties and
the bills practically killed me,

350
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:21,130
but I knew I needed to deeply understand
all the destructive things that had

351
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:26,131
happened to me in order to try to live
a remarkable life despite these things,

352
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:30,820
and I wanted this more than
anything over the years,

353
00:22:30,821 --> 00:22:35,110
I still sometimes smart at the moon,
at the monthly invoices,

354
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:39,370
but I've never doubted that
this investment has profoundly,

355
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:41,800
profoundly shaped who I've become.

356
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,980
And although I still think
I have a lot of work to do,

357
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:49,330
it's changed and then saved my
life in every imaginable way.

358
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:54,250
And I'm in what is called psychoanalytic
psychotherapy. Put another way,

359
00:22:54,251 --> 00:22:57,460
psycho analysis with an
emphasis on self psychology.

360
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:00,070
And so for me talk therapies,

361
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:05,050
the only thing that I've ever really felt
drawn to things like EMDR and behavior

362
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:08,320
modification might be really,
really helpful for other people,

363
00:23:08,321 --> 00:23:10,480
but they seem a little
bit to Voodoo for me.

364
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:14,440
So some things that I think are
important to consider strictly from my

365
00:23:14,441 --> 00:23:15,041
perspective,

366
00:23:15,041 --> 00:23:20,041
I'm not an expert at assessing or
analyzing the value or worth of psycho

367
00:23:20,991 --> 00:23:25,900
analysis only I am able to
convey what this has done for me.

368
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:31,230
Um, but for, for me, once a week therapy
did not work well twice and more,

369
00:23:31,231 --> 00:23:35,380
it gives you a continuity
and an opportunity to
germinate in a way that once a

370
00:23:35,381 --> 00:23:38,770
week doesn't. Also, once a week
almost feels like a catch up.

371
00:23:38,771 --> 00:23:42,160
You sort of bring the therapist up to
speed on what happened in the last week

372
00:23:42,161 --> 00:23:44,860
and then you have 20 minutes to sort of
talk about what's happening right now.

373
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:47,840
Sarah B takes time.

374
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:51,620
I often say that anything worthwhile
takes a long time and therapy is one of

375
00:23:51,621 --> 00:23:55,970
those things. I've been in therapy
for a really long time for decades,

376
00:23:56,420 --> 00:24:01,420
but I can now after those decades actually
point to empirical evidence of how my

377
00:24:02,421 --> 00:24:07,421
behavior in the world by my sense of
who I am has fundamentally fundamentally

378
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,670
changed.

379
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:15,980
And so being in therapy and being
therapy for any length of time,

380
00:24:15,981 --> 00:24:19,340
it takes dedication. It takes
stamina, it takes resilience,

381
00:24:19,341 --> 00:24:24,341
persistence and a lot of courage to face
things that you might be really afraid

382
00:24:25,431 --> 00:24:29,240
to look at. So it's not a
quick fix but, but like I said,

383
00:24:29,241 --> 00:24:30,770
it's really saved my life.

384
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,580
Try and tell your therapist everything.

385
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:39,380
If you edit who you are or if you pretend
to be something that you're not in

386
00:24:39,381 --> 00:24:41,390
order to impress the therapist.

387
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:44,840
If you want to project who
were how you want to be seen,

388
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:48,500
it will take that much longer.
So just be yourself.

389
00:24:48,501 --> 00:24:52,070
They've likely in their practice,
heard everything.

390
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,520
They understand humanity.
So just be yourself.

391
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,040
If you're afraid your
therapist will judge you.

392
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:02,450
Tell them that also because that
whole projection is really critical to

393
00:25:02,451 --> 00:25:06,230
understanding the dynamic that
you have with people in general.

394
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,410
So all of these things are
really important to talk about.

395
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:14,420
There is no shame in feeling shame.

396
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:17,900
And I'm saying this from
a place of deep empathy.

397
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:20,420
Almost everyone feels shame.

398
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:25,070
I think Bernay Brown says that anybody
that doesn't feel shame is likely, um,

399
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:27,380
a pathological person.

400
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:31,670
So almost everyone does in therapy
will help you understand it.

401
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:36,140
There was nothing like understanding
your motivations and insecurities to help

402
00:25:36,141 --> 00:25:41,030
you integrate all of those feelings
in your psyche in the most healthy and

403
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:45,230
authentic way.
So for me,

404
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:48,620
I would not recommend going to a
therapist that one of your friends goes to

405
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:51,140
asking your friends for,
for all,

406
00:25:51,141 --> 00:25:55,250
and then going to somebody that they
see might seem like a good idea because

407
00:25:55,251 --> 00:25:56,330
that person trusts them.

408
00:25:56,331 --> 00:25:59,210
And therefore by extension you
might feel like you can too.

409
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:04,780
But it ends up blurring things.
Um,

410
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:05,510
quite a bit.

411
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:09,440
And I think most therapists abide by
this rule now of not seeing friends of,

412
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:11,980
or clients of, of friends. Um,

413
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:16,820
things really do get very blurry and
boundaries can get weird and I just don't

414
00:26:16,821 --> 00:26:21,140
recommend that. Okay, big
elephant in the room here.

415
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:23,120
It is going to be expensive.

416
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:26,930
But what is more valuable than
better understanding who you are,

417
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:29,330
breaking intrinsic bad habits,

418
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:33,350
getting over much of your shit or at
least understanding why you do the shit in

419
00:26:33,351 --> 00:26:37,340
the first place and generally
living a happier, more contented,

420
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,450
more peaceful life. One thing that
I've come to understand recently,

421
00:26:41,451 --> 00:26:45,360
and this was actually not only through
the help of my therapist and guidance

422
00:26:45,361 --> 00:26:47,490
from my therapist,
but also through my dear,

423
00:26:47,491 --> 00:26:51,240
dear friend Seth Goden is understanding
the difference between happiness and

424
00:26:51,241 --> 00:26:52,074
pleasure.

425
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:57,380
And I think people are often trying to
reach for and strive for pleasure and,

426
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:04,670
and the response to trying to seek
pleasure is actually wanting more pleasure

427
00:27:05,581 --> 00:27:08,520
after that. You know, we live
on this hedonistic treadmill,

428
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:12,990
we metabolize our purchases
and our experiences very
quickly and so when we have

429
00:27:12,991 --> 00:27:16,560
that pleasure or experience that pleasure,
then we want more.

430
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:20,820
Happiness is very different. Happiness
essentially means you're okay as is.

431
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,390
You don't need more, you don't want
more, you feel good with what you have.

432
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:29,670
And I think that therapy really helps you
understand the difference between what

433
00:27:29,671 --> 00:27:31,590
you see,
what your motivations are,

434
00:27:31,591 --> 00:27:35,220
and ultimately what you want and how
you can manifest that in your life.

435
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:41,010
So breaking these intrinsic bad habits,

436
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:45,750
getting over much of your
shit and generally living
this happier, more contented,

437
00:27:45,751 --> 00:27:50,751
more peaceful life is something that I
think is the ultimate gift of therapy or

438
00:27:52,651 --> 00:27:55,470
the payoff. And, and Leslie,

439
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,470
my advice to anyone looking for a
therapist is to make sure they're really

440
00:27:58,471 --> 00:28:01,290
trained eye.
I highly recommend training here,

441
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:05,130
a phd and MD plus postdoctoral training.

442
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:09,630
You really do get what you pay for here
and I highly recommend somebody that is

443
00:28:09,631 --> 00:28:12,480
truly fully educated in what they do.

444
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:20,150
What are bad recommendations you hear
in your profession or area of expertise?

445
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,440
I don't believe in work life balance.

446
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,930
I believe if you view
your work as a calling,

447
00:28:24,931 --> 00:28:29,700
it is a labor of love rather than
laborious. When your work is a calling,

448
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:33,390
you're not approaching the amount of hours
you were working with with this sense

449
00:28:33,391 --> 00:28:38,370
of dread or counting the minutes until
the weekend you're calling can become a

450
00:28:38,371 --> 00:28:43,110
life affirming engagement that can
provide its own balance and spiritual

451
00:28:43,111 --> 00:28:47,220
nourishment and ironically,
it takes hard work to achieve this.

452
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:50,880
So when you were in your 20s and your
thirties and you want to have a remarkable

453
00:28:50,881 --> 00:28:53,670
fulfilling career,
you must work hard.

454
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:58,530
If you don't work harder than everyone
else, you will not get ahead. Also,

455
00:28:58,531 --> 00:29:02,610
if you're looking for work life balance
in your 20s or 30s you're likely in the

456
00:29:02,611 --> 00:29:05,430
wrong career.
If you're doing something that you love,

457
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:07,590
you don't want work life balance,

458
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:11,160
you want to be able to do this thing
that you love is often as possible.

459
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,210
Our guest today is Neil Strauss.

460
00:29:17,211 --> 00:29:22,211
You
can
find
him on
twitter@neilstraussinstagramatneal_straussandneilstrauss.com

461
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:27,710
he is an eight time New York
Times bestselling author.

462
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:32,450
He is a glutton for punishment,
likes to write a lot of books,

463
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,021
his books,

464
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:36,620
the game and rules of the game for which
he went undercover in a secret society

465
00:29:36,621 --> 00:29:37,490
of pickup artists,

466
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,350
made him an international celebrity in
an accidental hero to men around the

467
00:29:41,351 --> 00:29:43,630
world and his followup book,
the truth,

468
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,330
subtitle and uncomfortable
book about relationships.

469
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:50,380
Strauss dives deep into the worlds
of sex addiction, non monogamy,

470
00:29:50,381 --> 00:29:54,100
infidelity and intimacy and explores
the hidden forces that caused people to

471
00:29:54,101 --> 00:29:56,140
choose each other,
stay together and break up.

472
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:59,260
He most recently
coauthored with Kevin Hart,

473
00:29:59,261 --> 00:30:02,980
the instant Number One New York Times
bestseller. I can't make this up.

474
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,330
Life lessons.

475
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:11,920
How has a failure or apparent
failure set you up for later success?

476
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:14,620
Do you have any favorite failure of yours?

477
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:18,280
And it's funny, like it's
such a theme, right? Like,

478
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,800
like those failures
might hurt at the time,

479
00:30:20,801 --> 00:30:23,800
but I think anyone who's got anywhere say
those failures are the best thing that

480
00:30:23,801 --> 00:30:25,720
ever happened to them.
I mean for me,

481
00:30:25,721 --> 00:30:28,600
and it's kind of embarrassing because I
ended up writing for the New York Times

482
00:30:28,601 --> 00:30:32,620
for 10 years, is I was actually
rejected from journalism school. Right.

483
00:30:32,621 --> 00:30:36,100
What's the lesson there is like
if you're rejected from something,

484
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,530
it doesn't mean it's not right for you.

485
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:43,680
It just means it wasn't right for the
person who made that decision. And,

486
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:47,020
and especially if you're doing
something new or difference, uh,

487
00:30:47,021 --> 00:30:49,570
and you're trying to go
somewhere that's very status quo,

488
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,250
they're not going to get your except you.

489
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:54,970
So it's a powerful thing and not a lot
of people have this inner confidence to

490
00:30:54,971 --> 00:30:59,500
know this is my passion and I don't
need someone to give me a green light to

491
00:30:59,501 --> 00:31:03,310
live in my passion. So, so, uh,

492
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:07,210
so I got rejected from journalism
school and I think if I got accepted,

493
00:31:07,211 --> 00:31:09,760
I would have followed the regular routes
and like been covering like city hall

494
00:31:09,761 --> 00:31:13,300
meetings and like, you know,
Weehawken New Jersey or something.

495
00:31:13,301 --> 00:31:15,970
And no offense to anyone,
everything. Weehawken uh, yeah.

496
00:31:15,971 --> 00:31:18,310
So not getting into journalism school
was the only reason I became a journalist

497
00:31:18,311 --> 00:31:21,810
and wrote for the New York
Times. Uh, and often right there,

498
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,440
there's other paths to
get to where you want.

499
00:31:23,441 --> 00:31:25,960
And sometimes you have to trust that
the path you're on is the right path.

500
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,000
In fact, you have to trust it
because there's no other path,

501
00:31:28,001 --> 00:31:31,960
but the one you're on. And
the bigger idea is this, uh,

502
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,590
the outcome is not the outcome.

503
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:38,890
And what I mean by this is
there's that as the famous,

504
00:31:38,891 --> 00:31:41,740
I want to say it says
Zen parable and it's a,

505
00:31:41,741 --> 00:31:43,720
and I'm going to totally
misquote it and get it wrong,

506
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:48,870
but there's a farmer and uh,
his horse breaks its brakes.

507
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:53,590
Uh, uh, his horse, I
dunno, as horse runs away,

508
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,590
let's say horse runs away and to
say, that's too bad. I'm sorry,

509
00:31:56,591 --> 00:31:59,180
your horse ran away. It's really gonna
mess up your farm. He's like, Nah,

510
00:31:59,181 --> 00:32:00,660
it's all right. You
know, you know, I'd be,

511
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:03,940
don't know yet if it's for the good or
for the bad. And then maybe his horse,

512
00:32:03,941 --> 00:32:07,030
I think it's worse, came back with
like four other horses. And again,

513
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,240
I'm totally massacring this parable,
but you'll get the point.

514
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:13,390
His horse came back with four other horses
and they're like, wow, that's amazing.

515
00:32:13,391 --> 00:32:17,140
Now you have horses. How lucky are you?
He's like, well, I dunno. We'll see.

516
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:21,450
Then one day his son is riding the
horse. Uh, one of the new horses,

517
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:24,790
the Horse Buxom the son, his throne, and
he breaks his, you're like, you know,

518
00:32:24,791 --> 00:32:28,150
really bad. They shatters and breaks his
leg. And they said, oh, that's too bad.

519
00:32:28,151 --> 00:32:31,450
I'm sorry, your son break your leg, broke
his leg. That's horrible for you and him.

520
00:32:31,451 --> 00:32:35,700
And now he can't work on the farm and
all these bad things. And the pharmacist,

521
00:32:35,701 --> 00:32:38,200
I don't know, you know, we'll see.
I don't know if it's bad or good.

522
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:43,160
Then there's suddenly a war and they go
to kind of draft people into the war.

523
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:44,540
And uh,

524
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:48,770
turns out the son can't go off to fight
because he's broken his leg and his life

525
00:32:48,771 --> 00:32:50,960
was saved because he's broke
his leg. I said, oh my God,

526
00:32:50,961 --> 00:32:54,590
thank God that horse three year son, now
he was likely saved. And the farmer says,

527
00:32:54,591 --> 00:32:55,580
I don't know.
We'll see.

528
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,830
And the point is you don't
know if something's good
or bad because he only one

529
00:33:00,831 --> 00:33:01,850
handing right.

530
00:33:01,851 --> 00:33:04,880
And even at any of the university goes
on in your family and your loved ones,

531
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,480
they go on to. So the outcomes, not
the outcome. The end is not the end.

532
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,290
We measure these things by
these end points that are
not the real end points for

533
00:33:12,291 --> 00:33:15,980
the truth is you don't know,
you'll see keep moving forward.

534
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,200
You don't know the outcome
is not the outcome.

535
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:24,960
What is one of the best or most
worthwhile investments you've ever made?

536
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:29,880
I would just say that for me it was time.

537
00:33:29,881 --> 00:33:33,570
Time is obviously the most valuable
resource we have. Side note,

538
00:33:33,571 --> 00:33:35,340
and this is something that's
often talked about here,

539
00:33:35,341 --> 00:33:40,341
is just people are so careful with their
money even with getting ripped off or a

540
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:45,150
dollar, $3, $5, yet they're so, uh, um,

541
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:49,140
generous with their time. In
fact, I shouldn't even meet
you with this right now.

542
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,550
I got things to do.

543
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,770
A little exercise that I learned from
a marketer named Dan Kennedy is a,

544
00:33:55,771 --> 00:33:57,330
there's kind of a form that you can do,

545
00:33:57,331 --> 00:34:00,480
which is figure out what
you make in a year, uh,

546
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:02,663
um,

547
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:06,870
divided by the amount of work hours in
a year and then divide that by three

548
00:34:06,871 --> 00:34:08,990
cause the average person only
spends one third of each workout.

549
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:11,160
We're working and that's
what your time is worth.

550
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:15,360
It's the next time you feel like an
obligation to go to lunch with someone,

551
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,071
you know,
add,

552
00:34:16,071 --> 00:34:19,650
add up and see if you really want to be
giving that person however many dollars

553
00:34:19,651 --> 00:34:21,660
that is.
So the point is,

554
00:34:21,910 --> 00:34:25,110
the best events and I made was actually
an investment of time, which was,

555
00:34:25,111 --> 00:34:29,580
I was an unpaid intern at the village
voice. And I think like the secrets and,

556
00:34:29,581 --> 00:34:32,070
and again, Robert Greene says
this in his book mastery.

557
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:35,490
It's something that's often said,
but like being willing to work.

558
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,130
And this goes against everything in the
culture right now and a lot of ways,

559
00:34:38,131 --> 00:34:43,131
but really being willing to work for
free and to be totally exploited.

560
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:47,370
Uh, he is as a resource. Um,

561
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:52,400
just to be around people who are writing
around people who are creative in Sida,

562
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:57,310
sort of busy a newspaper newsroom
that was full of, you know,

563
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,960
culture and life and to be around
artists and critics and writers.

564
00:35:00,961 --> 00:35:03,030
I really admire that,
like changed my life.

565
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:06,750
If I was not an unpaid intern at the
village voice and got rejected from

566
00:35:06,751 --> 00:35:10,170
journalism school, again I wouldn't
be writing and talking to you.

567
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:14,670
I literally spent a year just opening
mail and doing people's expense reports

568
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:17,370
and waiting for the chance
just to write like once.

569
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:20,200
But the crazy thing is once I wrote once,
no one knew I was an intern.

570
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:23,430
They just thought it was a writer for the
village voice. And that got me really,

571
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:28,290
uh, you know, really far. I think I
stayed there for four years. I think they,

572
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:32,160
it was really hard for them to get
rid of me was so, uh, so that, that,

573
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:33,530
that actually was my,

574
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:36,960
my journalism school and I only learned
to write by having great editors.

575
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:42,620
So I would say like being willing to
listen to someone who is a more proficient

576
00:35:42,661 --> 00:35:43,320
at you.

577
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:48,000
Then something telling you what you're
doing wrong and internalizing that and

578
00:35:48,001 --> 00:35:52,320
not taking it personally is, is
huge. Are they always right? No,

579
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:56,820
but they might know more than he is. So
it's worth seriously considering. Um,

580
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:01,260
I've seen amazing people who
are just starting something new,

581
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:06,090
who let their ego get in the way
of a good lesson or opportunity.

582
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:10,050
I've sat there why maybe the greatest
surfer in the world is giving an amateur

583
00:36:10,051 --> 00:36:15,051
surfer advice and amateur surfer is so
worried that there'll be judged by the

584
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:16,560
famous guy.

585
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,430
Did they try to pretend when they think
they know what they're talking about and

586
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,480
what they know about surfing
instead of just shutting up,

587
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:25,500
listening and trying it.
Um, and here's what I,

588
00:36:25,501 --> 00:36:27,060
here's another thing about
everybody who's great.

589
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,670
I can go off on these questions forever,
but another thing,

590
00:36:29,671 --> 00:36:32,760
but everybody who's great is
even if they don't agree with it,

591
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:36,660
they're willing to try it if it won't
hurt them or someone else. So again,

592
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:39,660
if we talk about certificate,
adjust your stance for me with writing,

593
00:36:39,661 --> 00:36:41,910
I remember my editor saying,
brush off the academic dust.

594
00:36:41,911 --> 00:36:45,750
I would like to quote French postmodernism
to like show people I was smarter or

595
00:36:45,751 --> 00:36:48,960
something. I don't know what I was
thinking, but try it first. Seriously,

596
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:51,330
try it and see if it works
before you discard it.

597
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:54,060
The big idea that's going to change
your life are going to change your

598
00:36:54,061 --> 00:36:55,950
creativity is the one you disagree with.

599
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:59,820
If you have the resistance
to it and you try it anyway,

600
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,520
that's where the big breakthrough is.
The ones you agree with,

601
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:05,550
you're already doing or believing so
there won't be a big breakthrough there.

602
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:12,490
Today's guest is Scott Belsky.

So without further ado,

615
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:08,950
please enjoy a few questions with the
ever so interesting and insightful,

616
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,120
Scott Belsky,

617
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:18,710
what are bad recommendations you hear
in your profession or area of expertise?

618
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:24,080
The first thing that came to my mind, uh,
was that industries are led by experts.

619
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:28,790
You know,
we idolize the experts in our industry.

620
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:33,890
We often forget that industries are often
transformed by neophytes, right? I mean,

621
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,000
we could,
you know,

622
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:39,010
bold transformations like Uber disrupting
transportation or airbnb disrupting

623
00:38:39,011 --> 00:38:43,840
hospitality. These are all plays
that were led by outsiders.

624
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:46,180
I remember,
I remember talking to Joe Gebbia,

625
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:50,380
cofounder of Airbnb who was saying
that he didn't even know common hotel

626
00:38:50,381 --> 00:38:53,170
industry terms when he had started airbnb.

627
00:38:53,171 --> 00:38:58,171
He had no background of the business
and as such a concept that so many hotel

628
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:02,950
executives discounted as ridiculous that
the customer would never want, you know,

629
00:39:02,951 --> 00:39:07,630
they were more open to and uh,
which begs the question, you know,

630
00:39:07,631 --> 00:39:09,510
perhaps the playbook,
the change in industry,

631
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:13,840
it is to be naive enough at the start to
question these basic assumptions and to

632
00:39:13,841 --> 00:39:17,990
stay alive long enough to employ skills
that are unique and advantage as to the

633
00:39:17,991 --> 00:39:20,170
space that you see to change new.

634
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:25,060
Perhaps this naive excitement
and pragmatic expertise
are as equally important

635
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:27,220
traits. Uh, but just a different times.

636
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:33,220
The second bad recommendations you
hear in your profession, um, is,

637
00:39:33,221 --> 00:39:37,430
uh, is that customers know
best. And the only, Gosh,

638
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:42,600
the only focus group I ever ran at the
hands was in the very beginning in 2007

639
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:46,270
when we were debating a number of
different approaches towards our mission,

640
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:49,720
which was to organize the
creative world. We presented, uh,

641
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:53,610
the focus group that we've
gathered together with a
bottle of wine. And, uh, uh,

642
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:56,980
one evening, uh, we presented it to
this focus group of participants,

643
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,930
five or six different ideas.

644
00:39:58,931 --> 00:40:01,360
And then ask them to complete a survey
because we were really trying to

645
00:40:01,361 --> 00:40:04,090
triangulate and what we would be
doing for us and our business.

646
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:08,680
Universally participants said that the
last thing that they wanted was quote

647
00:40:08,681 --> 00:40:12,310
unquote, yet another social network
to connect with creative peers.

648
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:15,370
They figured that my space was
sufficient for this purpose,

649
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:19,930
but when they were asked by us
about their greatest struggles,

650
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:22,480
participants talked about, uh, you know,

651
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:26,620
the expense and efficiencies and
maintaining an online portfolio and how

652
00:40:26,621 --> 00:40:30,070
difficult it was to get attribution for
the creative work that they had made.

653
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:35,200
And so we were faced with a classic
example of don't ask customers what they

654
00:40:35,201 --> 00:40:37,180
want,
figure out what they need.

655
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:41,350
And we ultimately built a social network
for creative professionals that is now

656
00:40:41,351 --> 00:40:44,740
the world's leading creative professional
community with over 12 million numbers.

657
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,380
And you know,
six years later it was acquired by Adobe.

658
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:49,240
And so there was an
important message there,

659
00:40:49,241 --> 00:40:52,810
which is you do always have to be
seeking empathy with your customer.

660
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:57,190
You can't always necessarily expect them
to know what you're supposed to do for

661
00:40:57,191 --> 00:40:58,024
them.

662
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:04,810
What advice would you give to a smart
driven college student about to enter the

663
00:41:04,811 --> 00:41:08,530
so called real world? What advice
do you think they should ignore?

664
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:13,330
So the f I started with the fact that
they should not hold out for the perfect

665
00:41:13,331 --> 00:41:18,040
job or title. Don't optimize for the
slightly higher salary, you know,

666
00:41:18,041 --> 00:41:19,150
instead focus on,

667
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:22,480
I think the two things that actually
matter it early on in the career.

668
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:23,613
Number one,

669
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:27,970
every step in your early career must
get you incrementally closer to it ever

670
00:41:27,971 --> 00:41:29,230
genuinely interests you.

671
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:33,770
And the most promising coffee success is
pursuing genuine interests and setting

672
00:41:33,771 --> 00:41:38,150
yourself up for the
circumstantial relationships,
collaborations, experiences,

673
00:41:38,151 --> 00:41:41,090
or mistakes of the eye that will
make all the difference in your life.

674
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:45,680
I like to say that a labor of love
always pays off just not how and when you

675
00:41:45,681 --> 00:41:48,830
expect. So you want to say
yourself out by, uh, to succeed,

676
00:41:48,831 --> 00:41:53,030
by taking new jobs and roles that you
incrementally closer to the things that

677
00:41:53,031 --> 00:41:54,740
are genuinely interesting to you.

678
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:58,460
And I think we oftentimes fall into
that spotlight of seduction where we're

679
00:41:58,461 --> 00:42:01,170
offered a great opportunity.
That sounds great, but um,

680
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:03,800
isn't getting us closer to an
interest in us over the long term.

681
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:06,110
And that is I think where
we get off the rails,

682
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:10,130
have a great career via
the number two is uh,

683
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:14,540
is the fact that the greatest lessons
you learned in the beginning of a career

684
00:42:14,541 --> 00:42:18,500
are about people you know, how to work
with people, be managed by people,

685
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:21,740
manage expectations with people and
lead other people. And so as such,

686
00:42:21,741 --> 00:42:26,450
the team you choose to join and your
boss are obviously huge factors in the

687
00:42:26,451 --> 00:42:29,390
value of a professional experience
early in your career. And again,

688
00:42:29,391 --> 00:42:34,070
I see so many people optimizing
for higher salary or a, uh,

689
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:34,490
you know,

690
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:37,670
cooler sending job and not actually doing
the diligence on who they're actually

691
00:42:37,671 --> 00:42:39,920
going to be working for or with,

692
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:48,250
I guess today is Veronica Belmont.

the wisdom of Veronica Belmont.

710
00:43:56,490 --> 00:44:00,990
How has a failure or apparent
failure set you up for later success?

711
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:04,200
Do you have a favorite failure of yours?

712
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:07,720
This one is kind of tough to talk about.
Um,

713
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:12,500
my favorite failure I guess a was hosting
the season six premiere of game of

714
00:44:12,501 --> 00:44:16,180
Thrones for Hbo. Uh, it
was great outwardly. Um,

715
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:20,270
but of course I made the mistake of
going online afterwards and reading the

716
00:44:20,271 --> 00:44:23,030
comments, super bad idea. Um,

717
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:27,680
I spent what should have been a really
magical evening sitting in my hotel room

718
00:44:27,681 --> 00:44:30,860
sobbing into the phone with my husband.
Uh,

719
00:44:30,861 --> 00:44:33,720
but with that feeling like
really came certainty,

720
00:44:33,721 --> 00:44:38,040
I had been casually thinking about making
a career switch for the previous six

721
00:44:38,041 --> 00:44:42,000
months or so, but I was scared of trying
to do something I had never done before

722
00:44:42,001 --> 00:44:46,200
professionally. So sitting there
in that hotel room, I thought,

723
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:50,880
why am I spending my time doing something
that consistently makes me miserable?

724
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:54,840
Why not finally just take that chance?
So I did.

725
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:59,330
I stopped taking any freelance
gigs. I, I wrapped up all of my,

726
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:04,360
my video contracts and I spent all of my
time learning about product management

727
00:45:04,561 --> 00:45:08,190
and, and figuring out where I
best fit in. So overall, I mean,

728
00:45:08,191 --> 00:45:09,360
it was a horrible night,

729
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:13,770
but it was also the impetus for
something completely new and wonderful.

730
00:45:13,771 --> 00:45:18,771
And I don't know if I would've been able
to really make that leap if I hadn't

731
00:45:18,961 --> 00:45:23,650
had such a horrible experience
that particular night. I, I,

732
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:28,700
I can almost see myself just having
spent the next year waffling on that

733
00:45:28,771 --> 00:45:32,100
decision. Um, so it was
nice to have that finality.

734
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:38,730
What are bad recommendations that you
hear in your profession or area of

735
00:45:38,731 --> 00:45:39,564
expertise?

736
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:44,320
I think people assume that you have
to weigh all feedback on your product,

737
00:45:44,321 --> 00:45:48,400
you know, whether that's a
podcast or, or an APP, whatever.

738
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:49,880
Equally,
uh,

739
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:54,550
not all feedback is created equal and not
all ideas from your users are going to

740
00:45:54,551 --> 00:45:55,990
be good ones.
Uh,

741
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:59,980
taking too much stock in feedback can
really change the vision for your own

742
00:45:59,981 --> 00:46:03,100
product and, and suddenly it's not
going to feel like yours anymore.

743
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:10,760
What advice would you give to a smart
driven college student about to enter the

744
00:46:10,761 --> 00:46:11,594
real world?

745
00:46:12,910 --> 00:46:16,150
I've given this advice so many
times throughout my career. It's,

746
00:46:16,151 --> 00:46:17,500
it's kind of ridiculous,

747
00:46:17,501 --> 00:46:22,390
but I think it still holds true for
almost any kind of career path or,

748
00:46:22,391 --> 00:46:24,750
or project you're working on.
A,

749
00:46:24,970 --> 00:46:29,500
don't wait until you get a job to do
the thing you want to be doing for most

750
00:46:29,501 --> 00:46:30,334
careers.

751
00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:35,020
Showing that you have initiative
by working on projects
related to your future.

752
00:46:35,021 --> 00:46:39,460
Hopeful job is an amazing way to get
a foot in the door. So for example,

753
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:42,070
if you want to be a
writer or a journalist,

754
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,920
start keeping a blog that
you update regularly.

755
00:46:44,921 --> 00:46:47,500
Something that you can show
them later that says, Hey,

756
00:46:47,501 --> 00:46:50,380
I've been writing about this
topic for the past year.

757
00:46:50,381 --> 00:46:54,760
Now I'm an expert in this area. If you
want to be an engineer or a programmer,

758
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,880
create and maintain a project on get hub.

759
00:46:57,910 --> 00:47:00,400
Get hub is basically like the new resume.

760
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,960
Anything that you can point to on
your linkedin that is screaming, hey,

761
00:47:04,961 --> 00:47:08,080
I'm passionate about this
stuff is going to work.

762
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,990
Hey guys, this is Tim again. Just a
few more things before you take off.

763
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,960
Number one,
this is five bullet Friday.

764
00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:19,200
Do you want to get a short email from me?

765
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:21,870
Would you enjoy getting a short
email from me every Friday?

766
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:26,400
That provides a little more soul of
fun before the weekend and five bullet

767
00:47:26,401 --> 00:47:31,000
Friday is a very short email where I share
the coolest things I've found or that

768
00:47:31,001 --> 00:47:32,620
I've been pondering over the week.

769
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:35,590
That could include favorite new
albums that I've discovered.

770
00:47:35,591 --> 00:47:39,040
It could include Gizmos and gadgets
and all sorts of weird shit that I've

771
00:47:39,041 --> 00:47:43,360
somehow dug up in the other
world of the esoteric as I do.

772
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:48,630
It could include favorite articles that
I've read and that I've shared with my

773
00:47:49,301 --> 00:47:52,030
close friends for instance,
and it's very short.

774
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:57,070
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness
before you head off for the weekend,

775
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:59,320
so if you want to receive that,
check it out.

776
00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:04,240
Just go to a four hour workweek.com
that's four hour work week.com all spelled

777
00:48:04,241 --> 00:48:08,140
out and just drop in your email and you
will get the very next one and if you

778
00:48:08,141 --> 00:48:09,520
sign up,
I hope you enjoy it.

779
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:14,260
This episode is brought to you
by Athletic Greens. Every year.

780
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,810
Of course people look for
new ways to become healthier,

781
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:20,320
to take their fitness and so
on to the next level. For me,

782
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:24,610
step number one is having some
form of nutritional insurance.

783
00:48:24,611 --> 00:48:28,420
That's how I would look at it and the
nutritional insurance needs to make sure

784
00:48:28,421 --> 00:48:31,150
all of my basic needs are met,

785
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:35,740
all the boxes checked regardless of
travel schedule, missed meals and so on.

786
00:48:36,130 --> 00:48:39,730
They're going to be times in the new
year when your diet and exercise will get

787
00:48:39,731 --> 00:48:44,380
interrupted. Life will interrupted in
during those times. You want a safety net?

788
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:47,800
I get asked all the time, if you could
only use one supplement, what would it be?

789
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:50,710
My answer is inevitably athletic Greens.

790
00:48:50,711 --> 00:48:53,230
It is your all in one
nutritional insurance.

791
00:48:53,231 --> 00:48:56,110
I recommended it in the four hour body,
did not get paid for that,

792
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,960
and I travel with it
to avoid getting sick.

793
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,960
I take it in the mornings to
ensure optimal performance.

794
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:03,460
It just covers all my basis.

795
00:49:03,490 --> 00:49:07,480
If I can't get what I need through whole
food meals throughout the rest of the

796
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,940
day.

deal on one of my favorite products,

799
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:21,160
and it covers my basis.

800
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:25,180
Each day is part of my routine and it
leaves me with less to worry about. If,

801
00:49:25,181 --> 00:49:28,540
for instance, I have to skip a meal
or just can't get a high quality meal,

802

so check it out.

Tim and learn all about this episode is

804
00:49:36,251 --> 00:49:38,290
brought to you by four sigmatic.

805
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:41,110
You might remember four sigmatic
for their mushroom coffee,

806
00:49:41,170 --> 00:49:45,280
which was created by those clever finished
founders and when I first mentioned

807
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:48,700
that coffee on this podcast,
the product sold out in less than a week.

808
00:49:48,701 --> 00:49:52,750
It lights you up like a Christmas tree,
which can be really useful. However,

809
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:57,190
recently I've been testing the opposite
side of the spectrum of new product and

810
00:49:57,191 --> 00:50:01,960
that is their Reishi mushroom elixir
to help me end my day to get to sleep.

811
00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:04,900
As you guys may know,
longtime listeners,

812
00:50:04,901 --> 00:50:08,590
at least I struggled with insomnia for
decades. I have a largely fixed that,

813
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:11,710
but still shutting off my monkey
brain has never been easy.

814
00:50:11,711 --> 00:50:14,470
It still isn't easy very
often and I found Reishi,

815
00:50:14,471 --> 00:50:17,860
which had been fascinated by for
a few years now, has been very,

816
00:50:17,861 --> 00:50:21,730
very effective and calming
their old formula. However,

817
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:26,650
four sigmatic old formula included
Stevia and I like to avoid sweeteners,

818
00:50:26,710 --> 00:50:29,480
all sweeteners for a host of reasons,

819
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:33,470
and I then just ping them and asked,
hey guys,

820
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:37,220
I would love to experiment with
this and maybe actually suggested,

821
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:40,640
but I'd like a version without
sweeteners if you'd be open to it,

822
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:41,930
but too much of a headache,
don't worry.

823
00:50:42,350 --> 00:50:46,070
And they are always game
for experimentation.

824
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:49,010
And so they created a special
custom version without the Stevia,

825
00:50:49,011 --> 00:50:52,340
without sweeteners.
Now it is part of my nightly routine.

826
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,490
Their ratio elixir comes
in single serving packets,

827
00:50:55,491 --> 00:50:58,430
which are perfect for travel and in fact
I'm about to leave the country right

828
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:02,270
now and I have a packet in front of me
that's just going to sit in the end of my

829
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:06,800
carry on bag.
You only need hot water and it mixes very,

830
00:51:06,801 --> 00:51:07,634
very easily.

831
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:12,200
Here's some recommended copy
that they put in the read,

832
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:16,010
so I'm going to read it and I'll
give you my take quote, a warning.

833
00:51:16,011 --> 00:51:17,540
For those in the experimental mindset,

834
00:51:17,630 --> 00:51:21,080
Reishi is strong and bitter in
parentheses like any great medicine.

835
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:22,640
So if the bitterness is too much,

836
00:51:22,641 --> 00:51:26,950
I recommend trying it with honey end or
nut milk such as almond milk and quote,

837
00:51:27,470 --> 00:51:29,120
so I'm going to say,
no,

838
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:33,650
you should suck it up and you should drink
the tea because it's not that bitter.

839
00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:37,880
And maybe should take the advice of all
Chinese people when they're criticizing

840
00:51:37,881 --> 00:51:40,370
young ins. When they
say, well, I'm sure cool,

841
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:45,350
which means you're not able to eat
bitterness. Bitter is in many cases,

842
00:51:45,351 --> 00:51:48,920
an indication of things that help
liver detoxification. It's on,

843
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:50,750
not saying that's the case here,

844
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:55,520
but I've tested this ratio
lecture on family members,

845
00:51:55,521 --> 00:51:57,980
on friends. Everybody has liked
it. It's a little bit, or if the,

846
00:51:57,981 --> 00:52:01,820
it's not that hard,
so I would just say suck it up and no,

847
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:03,980
don't put it in honey or nut
milk or any of that shit.

848
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:07,670
Just drink the goddamn tea. It's
delicious. I think. All right.

849
00:52:07,671 --> 00:52:09,830
If you like to air and that kind of stuff,
that type of tea,

850
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:14,510
you're going to dig it. So just
try it. Okay. Back to then my read.

851
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:18,680
If you'd like to naturally improve
your sleep, both onset and quality,

852
00:52:18,681 --> 00:52:23,681
I think naturally you might just
enjoy this ratio lecture without any

853
00:52:23,931 --> 00:52:28,430
sweeteners. It has organic, Reishi
extract, organic fueled, mid extract,

854
00:52:28,431 --> 00:52:32,870
organic rose hips extract, organic
Tulsi extract. And that's it.

855
00:52:33,470 --> 00:52:38,060
No fancy stuff, no artificial watching
McCall at anything. So check it out.
