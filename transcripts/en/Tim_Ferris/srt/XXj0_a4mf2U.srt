1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,690
Why good morning you sexy beast. Would you
like me to make you some breakfast? Oh,

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,810
I'm sorry. I was having flashback
there folks. This is Tim Ferris.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:08,830
This is an addendum,

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:13,570
an urgent update recorded after this
episode is completed because I was going

5
00:00:13,571 --> 00:00:18,070
through a roster of all
of the most amazing things
I've been able to experience

6
00:00:18,071 --> 00:00:22,510
in my life and at the top of the
list was floating at zero gravity,

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:27,840
experiencing weightlessness in a shuttle
and being able to say chase after

8
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:32,830
globules of water floating in midair or
chase skittles that you've tossed into

9
00:00:32,831 --> 00:00:34,720
the air.
It's floating right in front of your face,

10
00:00:34,721 --> 00:00:39,370
say five feet away or scurrying around
all the way around the perimeter of the

11
00:00:39,371 --> 00:00:42,910
shuttle, like a hamster in a hamster
wheel if you were inverted. In a way,

12
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:47,350
it's really amazing and I loved it so
much that I decided to give away a flight.

13
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:51,970
So I am giving away a flight at
zero gravity and you can get it.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,810
There's no cost involved,
but it's only possible this week.

15
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:59,980
That is the week of Monday,
April 20th so jump on this right now.

16
00:00:59,981 --> 00:01:02,470
I would suggest that you

I've been using listen
headphones since they came out,

30
00:02:09,711 --> 00:02:13,280

the company after reading the four hour

workweek and now they're available
in Nordstrom and all over the place.

Hello Ladies and gentlemen,

55
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:48,910
this is Tim Ferriss and welcome to
another episode of the Tim Ferriss show.

56
00:03:48,911 --> 00:03:53,050
I am drinking tea with coconut
oil in it because I am in Ketosis.

57
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:57,850
So my brain is running like speedy
Gonzales on some type of biochemical

58
00:03:57,851 --> 00:04:00,610
advantage, but that's not
what I'm here to talk about.

59
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,930
I am here to do what I do every episode
and that is deconstruct world class

60
00:04:04,931 --> 00:04:09,490
performers to find the tools,
tricks, routines, habits,

61
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:13,420
and so on that you can use whether
those people are billionaire investors.

62
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:17,170
Like for instance Peter Teal,
who was the first money into Facebook,

63
00:04:17,171 --> 00:04:22,171
also co founder of paypal and Palentier
or celebrities and actors like Arnold

64
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:24,490
Schwarzenegger,
uh,

65
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:29,520
tech icons like Matt Mullenweg behind
a wordpress and wordpress.com and so on

66
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:31,690
and so forth.
Musicians,

67
00:04:31,691 --> 00:04:36,250
we've got everybody and I have wanted to
interview a professional wrestler for a

68
00:04:36,251 --> 00:04:39,160
very long time now after seeing the movie,
the wrestler,

69
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,230
but also having wrestled myself and uh,

70
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:47,280
having watched WWE and WWF
f before that and then the,

71
00:04:47,741 --> 00:04:52,741
the rise of MMA and I managed
to get ahold of a fantastic,

72
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:56,710
fantastic performer and
incredible athlete, triple h.

73
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:00,970
So triple h who is a 13 time
world champion in the WWE,

74
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:02,021
but that is not all.

75
00:05:02,021 --> 00:05:05,830
He's also the executive vice president
of talent live events and creative at the

76
00:05:05,831 --> 00:05:10,480
WWE. And we talk about just
about everything in this episode.

77
00:05:10,481 --> 00:05:15,481
His real name is Paul Levesque and we
dig into the questions of misconceptions

78
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:21,610
related to both triple h,
his, uh, his stage name,

79
00:05:21,611 --> 00:05:25,930
his stage persona and WWE the important
lessons he learned while training with a

80
00:05:25,931 --> 00:05:27,700
wrestler named killer Kuwalski,

81
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:32,170
including getting hit in the back of the
head with a phone book in a garbage bag.

82
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,190
Ouch. Uh, and, uh, we
get into his longevity,

83
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:40,720
how he avoids and also repairs injuries,
pregame rituals,

84
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,380
including input from a
trainer named Joe to Franco.

85
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:47,500
Of course his colleague and arms.
The undertaker and even Floyd Mayweather.

86
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:52,420
And who does he model? Uh,
how does he view parenting?

87
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:56,590
He has a bunch of daughters, uh, and uh,
it goes on and on. We really dig deep.

88
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,340
It's a turned out

89
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:01,340
better than I could have expected
and I expected it to be good.

90
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,190
So I hope you really enjoy this.
Of course I'll show notes.

91
00:06:04,191 --> 00:06:08,930
Can Be found a four hour workweek.com
forward slash podcast all spelled out and

92
00:06:08,931 --> 00:06:13,931
please enjoy my conversation with the
one and only triple h Paul Levesque.

93
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:19,640
Paul, welcome to the show. Thank you
very much medicine honor to be here.

94
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:22,220
I am so excited for this.
You are a massive human being.

95
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,670
It makes your job requirement then.

96
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,510
It does seem to be a job
requirement and the eye,

97
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:32,540
you have worn a lot of hats and
I've had a lot of different titles,

98
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:33,380
a lot of different jobs.

99
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,410
When someone asks you what do you
do if they don't recognize you,

100
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,580
how do you answer that question?

101
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,510
Oh God, it's funny now
because I'm kind of in that,

102
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:46,690
this weird kind of Combo twilight
zone of the last bits of my,

103
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:49,750
my in ring wrestling career, you know? Um,

104
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:54,570
even then when I did it then I used to
say I was an entertainer and because if

105
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:58,010
people are the WWE is a weird thing,

106
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:02,510
like one of those things, like
if you, if you're not into it,

107
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:06,980
no explanation can explain it to you to
make you like it and then you are into

108
00:07:06,981 --> 00:07:11,850
it. There's no explanation necessary, you
know, it, it just is what it is. And, um,

109
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:18,640
so to say, sometimes it, oh,
WWE, like it would go like,
oh, look at the rest of them,

110
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:22,720
you know? And it just had
a weird connotation to it.
When you say entertainer, oh,

111
00:07:22,721 --> 00:07:26,650
what kind of, Oh, you know, WWE, it just
took on a different meaning. Sure. Uh,

112
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:31,000
to people that don't understand what
we do. Um, so I was went with that.

113
00:07:31,001 --> 00:07:33,640
Right now it's, um, it's
kind of a combo. You know,

114
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:37,210
we have a saying that we use that WWE,

115
00:07:37,211 --> 00:07:41,380
which is our job is to put
smiles on people's faces
and it's kind of the overall

116
00:07:41,381 --> 00:07:45,490
thing of what we do.
But I spend 90% of my day as an executive.

117
00:07:45,491 --> 00:07:46,960
So there you go.

118
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,560
Okay.
We're going to also,

119
00:07:48,561 --> 00:07:51,890
we're going to dig into that and rewind
the clock and look at the trajectory,

120
00:07:51,891 --> 00:07:56,891
but what are misconceptions
that people have about you or

121
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,710
triple h or at WWT? Um, I
think they don't, you know,

122
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:07,070
they just see what they see
on TV. They see, you know, um,

123
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,840
okay.

124
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,260
The, the misconception for me is
that I'm very much what you see on,

125
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:17,250
on television or him that
I'm this character or they
see the simplistic things

126
00:08:17,251 --> 00:08:21,480
of what we do. You know, it's funny, even
if you have this huge fan of the WWE,

127
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:26,220
they get so upset over
things like, um, well good.

128
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:30,810
Why would this guy be that guy? Just Co,
you know, it's one of the terms right now.

129
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:35,220
It's buried them, you know,
it's, um, it's a show.

130
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:39,810
And what they don't get about our
show is we are like this never ending.

131
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:44,820
If you can compare it to whatever you
want, comic books, soap, opera, TV,

132
00:08:44,821 --> 00:08:48,930
drama, movie, but it never ends.
There's always another chapter.

133
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:51,990
And they get so upset in the moment
of not knowing that, you know,

134
00:08:51,991 --> 00:08:54,570
not liking maybe the end of
the chapter that they're on,

135
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,520
there's another chapter
to search tomorrow.

136
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,830
It actually started right now
when this one ended, you know,

137
00:08:58,831 --> 00:09:02,700
and they don't get that and they can't
wait for that and they don't understand

138
00:09:02,701 --> 00:09:06,360
all the complexities that goes
on, you know, go on behind
the scenes. So it's that,

139
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:10,520
that's probably the biggest misconception
is that we're just, you know, the,

140
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:13,140
that the WWE is just a bunch of guys,
um,

141
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,230
at its simplest form that just go to the
ring in their underwear and pretend to

142
00:09:16,231 --> 00:09:19,680
fight with each other, you know? Um,
but when you really break it down,

143
00:09:19,681 --> 00:09:22,230
it's a massive global business.

144
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:26,430
Oh, there's a lot behind it. Oh my God.
I've been so impressed by it for so,

145
00:09:26,431 --> 00:09:28,500
so long.
Not The least of which,

146
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:31,920
and we'll certainly explore the,

147
00:09:31,921 --> 00:09:34,290
the physical and mental stamina.

148
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:37,890
How many matches would
you say you have had

149
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:42,760
total to date? Televised or
otherwise? Thousands, you know, if,

150
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:47,400
if you break it down simplistically
in math is not my strong suit. So,

151
00:09:47,401 --> 00:09:51,590
but you know, I started
wrestling I think in like 93 ish,

152
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,750
just just training.
92 93 training.

153
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:58,680
And was this in New Hampshire or was
this in New Hampshire? I went to, um,

154
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:02,580
I trained with a guy named [inaudible]
wall ski and old who my Mama loves by the

155
00:10:02,581 --> 00:10:06,270
way. Oh really? Yeah. I wanted to dig
into that. Yeah, he was, uh, you know,

156
00:10:06,271 --> 00:10:10,800
one of the first guys to become kind
of like globally known and I started

157
00:10:10,801 --> 00:10:13,760
training with a Meta camp, a
school, if you want to call it that.

158
00:10:13,761 --> 00:10:18,600
It was like a little rundown mill
building with a boxing ring in it and a in

159
00:10:18,601 --> 00:10:20,700
Malden, Massachusetts. And I
started training under there.

160
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:25,730
So if you break it down from there to
today of 20 plus years and then when you

161
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,050
know,
once I made it to the WWE,

162
00:10:31,051 --> 00:10:34,920
which was 95 even if you just want to
look at it from there and just say 20

163
00:10:34,921 --> 00:10:36,510
years,
20 years,

164
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:41,511
I probably for a lot of those
years wrestled 250 280 days a year.

165
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,730
Sometimes on the weekends
we did double shots,

166
00:10:44,731 --> 00:10:48,990
so we'd wrestle a matinee in the afternoon
and then a night show. So it's a lot.

167
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,090
A lot of mileage. Yeah,
it's a lot of mileage. Yeah.

168
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:55,140
What were the most thing we always
said, it's not the years, it's the miles

169
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:01,550
it both figuratively and literally
and it's a hell of a lot of travel.

170
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,090
But before I get to asking you about
travel and all of these different training

171
00:11:05,091 --> 00:11:05,924
aspects,

172
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:10,870
what were the most important lessons you
learned while training with killer call

173
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:11,723
scheme?

174
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:12,991
It's funny.

175
00:11:12,991 --> 00:11:17,790
A lot of the things I think as in
life he taught me a lot of things.

176
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,430
Um, that I didn't know he
was teaching me at the time.

177
00:11:20,431 --> 00:11:22,650
He would tell me a lot of things
that I would be like, ah, he's,

178
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:26,780
he's just like the Mr
Miyagi approach. Yeah, yeah.

179
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:32,340
It was a very, it would have worked
very well in today's millennial age,

180
00:11:32,341 --> 00:11:34,100
but like he had that his
theory of telling you,

181
00:11:34,101 --> 00:11:36,270
you did something wrong was hitting you
in the back of the head with a phone

182
00:11:36,271 --> 00:11:41,130
book that was in like a shopping
bag, you know? And, um, but yeah,

183
00:11:41,131 --> 00:11:42,540
he,
he would just teach all the,

184
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,980
he wouldn't say a whole lot and then all
of a sudden he'd come in and he would

185
00:11:46,981 --> 00:11:51,160
say, um, you know, it needs to,

186
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:55,120
you need to be spectacular. Make
everybody look at you, no one else.

187
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,550
And then he would just walk away
and then you'd be like, well,

188
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,610
what does that mean? Like, I
don't, you know what I mean?

189
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,390
You kind of had to figure it out.

190
00:12:01,391 --> 00:12:05,200
Now there's a lot of things that he said
to me then that I find myself telling

191
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:09,220
the young guys now in a different way.
Um,

192
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:14,530
but it's the same lessons
kind of, you know? Um,

193
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,400
are there any examples that
come to mind? Well, just,

194
00:12:17,401 --> 00:12:20,320
just in how to be spectacular,

195
00:12:20,321 --> 00:12:25,030
but also out of to break things down into,
to just look at what you do.

196
00:12:25,031 --> 00:12:26,860
Like never be,

197
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,160
never be satisfied with what you do.

198
00:12:30,161 --> 00:12:34,630
If you don't do something well don't do
it unless you want to spend the time to

199
00:12:34,631 --> 00:12:37,510
improve that.
Like it's still to this day,

200
00:12:37,511 --> 00:12:40,810
I see a lot of guys do stuff in the ring
that I'm like, hm. He doesn't do that.

201
00:12:40,811 --> 00:12:44,530
Well he does it all the time. It's
just, you know, you shouldn't do that.

202
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:47,790
I have things that I don't do
well in the ring. Just don't know.

203
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:50,470
It's just what would
be, oh man. For example,

204
00:12:50,471 --> 00:12:52,970
there's this one thing that
guys take where they, they um,

205
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:58,330
they go through the top and middle
turnbuckle and hit the post right from the

206
00:12:58,331 --> 00:13:01,880
inside and uh, hit it with
their shoulder. I just,

207
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:05,170
it's one of those mental block
things for me. Like I can't,

208
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:08,950
I just can't seem to navigate
going between the two
turnbuckles and getting the

209
00:13:08,951 --> 00:13:09,251
thing.

210
00:13:09,251 --> 00:13:13,660
Like I always get stuck somehow or ab
tried to do it before and it's just one of

211
00:13:13,661 --> 00:13:16,810
those things like it doesn't work
out well for me, so I never do it.

212
00:13:16,811 --> 00:13:19,900
And if guys will grab me in the
ring over the years and say like,

213
00:13:19,901 --> 00:13:24,370
take the post and I'll just,
no, no. You know what I mean?

214
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:26,380
Cause I don't midflight correction,
I just don't do that.

215
00:13:26,381 --> 00:13:27,430
Well I'm not going to do it.

216
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:31,270
And I think there's little things like
that that guys don't analyze what they do,

217
00:13:31,271 --> 00:13:35,320
they do what they do and then
they go and they say, oh,

218
00:13:35,321 --> 00:13:38,230
that was really good in the
overall picture of things.
Right. It was really good.

219
00:13:38,231 --> 00:13:39,580
People really liked it.
It was,

220
00:13:39,581 --> 00:13:42,440
but there were some things in there
that weren't really good. So the,

221
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:46,060
it averaged out well, but there are
things they should have admitted. Yeah.

222
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,810
You know, and to me, I don't
know, I've always been the
kind of guy, if, if you're,

223
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:55,180
if you're doing it, why, why
wasn't everything, which you
wanted it to be in there,

224
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:56,950
there shouldn't be wasted movement.

225
00:13:56,951 --> 00:14:00,820
There shouldn't be things that
aren't what you want them to be.

226
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:04,750
I don't want to do something just to get
to the next thing, you know? No, I do.

227
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:08,920
And what are you particularly good at
in the, in that, in that environment,

228
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:11,650
what are the things that you,
the strengths that you focused on?

229
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:14,860
For me it was never about,
um,

230
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:19,900
he was never about individual moves.
And I think as the business,

231
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,150
maybe some guys now look at that and they,

232
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:25,380
they think differently because they
might look at my style and say, look,

233
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:28,840
I was never over the top spectacular guy,
but I wasn't supposed to be.

234
00:14:28,841 --> 00:14:33,190
I was usually the bad guy.
So I wanted to have that.

235
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:37,360
I want it to be that constant and let
the other guy be spectacular around me.

236
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:42,520
And it, for me, it was never
about the spectacular moves.

237
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:45,910
It was about the drama of the,
the match.

238
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,300
And I look at what we do is,
um,

239
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:55,670
we're, we're more like rocky the
movie, then we are legitimate,

240
00:14:56,310 --> 00:15:00,740
you know, like boxing, right? It's
about the story that you tell.

241
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,980
So if the story is really good going in
and you care about the two characters,

242
00:15:03,981 --> 00:15:07,280
and then you make that emotional story
play out through those two characters,

243
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,910
non-verbally in the ring,
that's the magic of what we do.

244
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,830
It doesn't matter if, you know, um,
yeah, it makes the highlight reel like,

245
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:19,130
oh my God, he did this one spectacular
move was crazy. I don't know how he,

246
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:22,950
he made it through that or whatever.
It's not really about that because

247
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:25,191
tomorrow there'll be,

248
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:28,130
I get another guy can do that move better
than you just did it and it will be

249
00:15:28,131 --> 00:15:30,500
even more spectacular.
He'll come up with another way to do it.

250
00:15:30,501 --> 00:15:31,910
That's even crazier.

251
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:35,440
Well, you mentioned rocky, right? It's,
it's, it's a, it's about the story arc,

252
00:15:35,441 --> 00:15:37,570
not just a handful of really
good lines of dialogue.

253
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,000
Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. And, and that's
the thing of it. And you'll watch,

254
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:44,360
it's one of the things that works.
We have the WWE network.

255
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,130
It's a lot of old content.

256
00:15:46,131 --> 00:15:50,240
People will go back and they'll
watch wrestlemania one, you know, um,

257
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,630
over and over again and
how great it is and,

258
00:15:53,631 --> 00:15:57,710
or wrestlemania three and all these
things is because it's an emotional story.

259
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,450
If it was just about the
moves, it wouldn't be so
impactful to you still it the,

260
00:16:01,451 --> 00:16:04,820
the emotional story of why people will
go back and watch the movie rocky over

261
00:16:04,821 --> 00:16:07,970
and over again because it's a great story.
Um,

262
00:16:07,971 --> 00:16:12,890
they very rarely go back and watch now
there's exceptions, Muhammad Ali and,

263
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:16,670
and for men or something, you
know, um, moments in time,

264
00:16:16,671 --> 00:16:21,100
but the average person,
unless they're like a boxing connoisseur,

265
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:23,570
doesn't go back and watch
boxing over and over again.

266
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:27,750
No. And you know, it's fascinating about
the examples you just gave, like a,

267
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,580
whether it's Ali Frazier or whatever,
those,

268
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:35,440
those in real life ended up being like
story arcs because you would have this

269
00:16:35,441 --> 00:16:38,260
back and forth in this drama
and the Thrilla in Manila.

270
00:16:38,261 --> 00:16:42,460
And there were all the elements of
sort of the, the monomyth or the, yeah.

271
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,750
Well, and even when you go back
and usually watch those fights,

272
00:16:45,751 --> 00:16:50,751
you go back and you watch them in a show
that now chronicles the story of the

273
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,390
ties them together. Yeah, yeah.
It chronicles the story of those,

274
00:16:54,391 --> 00:16:59,040
those epic contests, you know, and that's
the reality of the story. You know, it's,

275
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:04,380
um, you know, said all the time, if
you know who's in the ring fighting,

276
00:17:04,381 --> 00:17:08,700
you'll tune in and your watch to just
watch two guys fight for no apparent

277
00:17:08,701 --> 00:17:13,080
reason. It's not that interesting
unless you're a connoisseur of the,

278
00:17:13,081 --> 00:17:14,750
of what they're doing.
You know,

279
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,900
if you're watching the UFC and you're a
big mixed martial arts fan or all those

280
00:17:18,901 --> 00:17:22,500
things, and there's a lot of
those, but they're very into the,

281
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:26,280
what's going on scientifically
and you know, the, the chess game,

282
00:17:26,281 --> 00:17:27,810
the technical chess game that's going on.

283
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,440
But that's not the general
public to hit the general public.

284
00:17:31,441 --> 00:17:34,550
They need to know something about the
two guys and why they're fighting.

285
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:35,563
You know,

286
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:39,050
the, uh, the fighting

287
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,820
at your peak point in,
in your,

288
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:46,220
your onstage wrestling career,

289
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:49,410
he mentioned 200 and something
like 250 to 300 days of the year.

290
00:17:49,411 --> 00:17:53,490
You're probably traveling something
like that and traveling. Yeah. And uh,

291
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:59,920
what were some of the keys to your
longevity being able to maintain that?

292
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:04,200
And I know we have a common connection
and Joe to Franco and he's mentioned that

293
00:18:04,201 --> 00:18:04,801
you very,

294
00:18:04,801 --> 00:18:08,430
very rarely if ever miss training days
and then maybe you could speak to that,

295
00:18:08,431 --> 00:18:11,340
but even if that means coming in at
two to three in the morning to train,

296
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:12,810
what are,

297
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:16,860
what have been some of the keys are
practices that have allowed you to sustain

298
00:18:16,861 --> 00:18:20,380
that type of torturous schedule?
Um,

299
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,110
I think you know, you,
you speak a lot in your,

300
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,150
in your podcast, in, in,

301
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:30,990
in your books and everything about
routines and having things that you do.

302
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,780
And I'm very big in that way.
And I like,

303
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,820
I like to have my life
kind of like when it,

304
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,240
when it gets chaotic
and bothers me and it's,

305
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:44,250
which sounds silly because like
what we do is chaotic at all times.

306
00:18:44,251 --> 00:18:47,040
Like my day varies and you know,

307
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,850
people talk about when you do live TV,
like Monday night raw for us,

308
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:55,260
we work on that show and edited and done
and sometimes you guys are walking up

309
00:18:55,261 --> 00:18:57,960
the curtain and somebody shouting a
change to them as they're walking through

310
00:18:57,961 --> 00:19:00,570
the curtain. You know, it's,
it's, so the chaos is there,

311
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:04,950
but having that consistent thing.
So for me,

312
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:08,550
I had very distinct things.

313
00:19:08,551 --> 00:19:13,551
Like if I was in the beginning there
wasn't as much supplements and there is a

314
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:18,360
little bit more difficult,
but as supplements became more available,

315
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:22,230
I would,
I'm like big on the preparation part.

316
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:26,610
So like if I was going to get on a
plane to fly to Japan, I would take,

317
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,500
um, either containers or, or
later when they were there, the,

318
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,610
I would make my own protein shakes.
Right.

319
00:19:32,611 --> 00:19:36,560
I'd put the two scoops of protein and
the thing, I'd put some oil in there,

320
00:19:36,561 --> 00:19:39,330
I'd whatever I needed, I'd put
the top on it, no liquid in there,

321
00:19:39,331 --> 00:19:43,320
and I'd stick it inside my carry on
bag so, and I would time it in my head.

322
00:19:43,321 --> 00:19:46,520
So I'm on the flight for, it's a 16
hour flight. I've gotten three hours.

323
00:19:46,521 --> 00:19:49,320
I need to eat every three hours. I'm not
going to count on the food on the plane.

324
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,270
That will just be bonus food.

325
00:19:51,271 --> 00:19:55,800
So every three hours I have a shake for
every three hours and then set my watch

326
00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:00,620
to go off every three hours, time to
eat, and I'd get a shake out, get water,

327
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:03,960
drink my shake, put it in and go back to
sleep. Right. Whatever I needed to do.

328
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:07,710
When I landed, I would check into
the hotel. Second we checked in,

329
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:11,010
I'd ask them to the gym open,
can I go train?

330
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,860
Even if it was to get on a
bike and ride for 15 minutes,

331
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:19,380
reset that I learned early that it seemed
to me anytime I did that I didn't get

332
00:20:19,471 --> 00:20:23,090
jet lag. Anytime I did that,
I seem to like we can kit,

333
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:26,370
we use wrestling terms like I've
got to kick out faster, right?

334
00:20:26,371 --> 00:20:29,250
So while everybody else would be
in the building dragon that day,

335
00:20:29,251 --> 00:20:32,430
I'd be like feminine. I feel great.
You know, I don't feel so bad.

336
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:36,930
I'm getting your blood flowing,
resetting your clock. Um, you know,

337
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:38,370
if we were in Australia,

338
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:43,670
I would always like that last day there
I would force myself to stay up because

339
00:20:43,741 --> 00:20:45,000
then I could sleep the whole way home.

340
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,100
And by the time I landed I was landing
in the morning and it's perfect.

341
00:20:48,101 --> 00:20:51,740
Like I'm just waking up and it's great.
You want to do the same thing Atlanta,

342
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:55,450
try to find a gym, whether it hotel
something, ride a bike, you set my clock,

343
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,800
do the deal, you know? Um,

344
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:01,930
so those routines and regimented
stuff and same with my training.

345
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:05,830
Um,
when new guys would start a lot.

346
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:09,310
I'm on the road like internationally
when we're all traveling together.

347
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,940
It's hard when you go overseas,
you're on a bus there,

348
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,220
there's a gym set up for you,
but they don't know how,

349
00:21:15,221 --> 00:21:17,850
like how do I get to the gym? I'm not
sure. Am I supposed to go downstairs,

350
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:21,460
get on a bus? I don't know. The guys
would always come to me and say,

351
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:26,230
hey look, we've always heard that you go
to the gym every day. Can I go with you?

352
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,290
So yeah, I'd meet downstairs,
bunch of guys who come down,

353
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:32,470
we'd all go to the gym together
cause I would go every day.

354
00:21:32,471 --> 00:21:35,350
I didn't like missing it.
I didn't like, you know,

355
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,310
it was to me was that regimented thing
and I can look back at my career and say,

356
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:44,550
I think part of that regimented stuff
is why I was able to maintain it or,

357
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:50,380
or maintain that schedule because I
was one of the guides also that really,

358
00:21:50,381 --> 00:21:53,770
truly believed in that when you make it,
the job gets harder.

359
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:56,740
It's not the other way around. You
don't make it and then go, okay,

360
00:21:56,741 --> 00:22:01,600
now I can cruise because now I'm the guy.
And now that means I can say no,

361
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,630
and I can not do these things. I felt
the opposite. When you get there,

362
00:22:04,631 --> 00:22:08,450
now it's your responsibility
to not say no. So, you know, I,

363
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:13,420
I've had times where I've worked 64
straight days and just everybody else went

364
00:22:13,421 --> 00:22:16,090
home. I went on a media tour,
everybody else went back home.

365
00:22:16,091 --> 00:22:19,090
I went to something else. I did
that for years, you know, and,

366
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:23,080
and that, um, that regimented,

367
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:27,820
having those distinct
patterns so to speak,

368
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,670
um,
I think helped help keep that.

369
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:34,940
I think it helps preserve your bandwidth
also for making decisions about other

370
00:22:34,941 --> 00:22:35,450
things.

371
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:40,450
So you don't have to decide each morning
or each day what all the elements that

372
00:22:41,331 --> 00:22:44,830
your teen are going to look like.
A, it's funny, I heard you talk, uh,

373
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:45,681
it just recently,

374
00:22:45,681 --> 00:22:50,390
I listen to podcasts and my research
for this because I've read your books,

375
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:54,650
but you're hearing somebody
speak is different than
what you put in your mind of

376
00:22:54,651 --> 00:22:56,630
how they speak. Right? So
I want to feel like, God,

377
00:22:56,631 --> 00:23:00,330
that guy sounds a hot dumber on audio,
but you know,

378
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:02,900
you put something if you had
to then get there and go vote.

379
00:23:02,901 --> 00:23:05,630
It's not what I expected at all.
So I listened to it.

380
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:11,610
Yes. Um, you, um, you spoke, uh,

381
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:15,990
and I forgot what I was
talking about. That was bad
interview etiquette on my, no,

382
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,510
no, no. Yeah, we were talking
about routines. It's bad memory on

383
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:25,490
routine. Oh, I know what I was going
to say. Yeah. I believe that um,

384
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:30,200
like training is almost like a
meditation. Right? I totally agree.

385
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:34,250
The Anthony Robbins say he didn't, didn't
meditate cause you like shutting off.

386
00:23:34,251 --> 00:23:35,870
He's the opposite.
He wants to just keep going.

387
00:23:35,871 --> 00:23:40,160
But I also believe you need to reboot
your brain because your brain will get

388
00:23:40,161 --> 00:23:41,120
stuck in like,

389
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:43,700
it's like when you go to sleep and you
can't stop thinking about something you

390
00:23:43,701 --> 00:23:45,530
got going on at work and
you can't get it out.

391
00:23:45,531 --> 00:23:49,220
And in the morning you realize that it
was actually jibberish that was in your

392
00:23:49,221 --> 00:23:50,720
brain going on.
Um,

393
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:56,960
I think training when you do it well,
if you're into it,

394
00:23:56,961 --> 00:23:58,610
like you can't focus,

395
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:03,200
you can't be in the middle of trying
to do a heavy set of something and be

396
00:24:03,201 --> 00:24:05,180
thinking about another project.

397
00:24:05,181 --> 00:24:08,090
You have to be in that moment
and it allows you to reboot,

398
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:13,160
which I kind of believe is what
meditation and all that stuff is. Anyways.

399
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:16,580
It's just a reset button for a second
that just allows you to go like, okay,

400
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:21,140
start over, clean the plate and
knowledge, do this again. You know?

401
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:23,750
And that's really to me what training is.
Definitely

402
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:30,200
digging a little bit more on the
routines. For instance, on in the last,

403
00:24:30,201 --> 00:24:33,920
let's just say as you've gotten older in
the last handful of years, how do you,

404
00:24:33,921 --> 00:24:38,921
what is your pregame ritual if you have
one before you're going to go out and

405
00:24:39,111 --> 00:24:41,150
compete and perform?

406
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:44,330
Yeah, that's all that. But it
just became this as the of, uh,

407
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:49,940
of age of I never, and just for people
listening, if you don't mind me asking,

408
00:24:49,941 --> 00:24:53,000
how old are you at the
45? But, so, you know,

409
00:24:53,001 --> 00:24:56,280
for years when I was doing all that
stuff with wrestling, you know,

410
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:59,330
wrestling all those dates and everything.
Um,

411
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:02,750
it's funny because some of the younger
guys would, would joke with me about it.

412
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:04,370
Like you're like the old school guy.

413
00:25:04,371 --> 00:25:07,940
Like I would literally be
sitting in a chair up at,

414
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:11,050
we call it gorilla position right
before you walk out the curtain, uh,

415
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:13,580
named after an old wrestler,
grill monsoon. But um,

416
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:16,930
I would just be sitting in
a chair. My music, it is,

417
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,820
I'd get up and go to the ring and say,
you don't warm up at all.

418
00:25:19,821 --> 00:25:23,660
So I'll walk to the ring as good to get a
good warm up. You know, I'll start slow,

419
00:25:23,661 --> 00:25:24,494
it'll be fine.

420
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:31,150
Now I have to like stretch and warm up.
And Joe Franco,

421
00:25:31,151 --> 00:25:32,740
you mentioned my strength
and conditioning guys.

422
00:25:32,741 --> 00:25:36,960
One of the things when I'm
really bad with years and dates,

423
00:25:36,961 --> 00:25:41,390
but the four years ago was my career
was kind of winding down and I was,

424
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:45,750
but I was, I was still wrestling fairly
regularly and I had had this problem,

425
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:50,220
I thought it was a neck
injury and a really having
all this problem with my neck

426
00:25:50,221 --> 00:25:53,280
and my shoulder. And I, I um,

427
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:56,310
I got a new position with a company where
I needed to go make a couple of movies

428
00:25:56,311 --> 00:25:59,280
for them. Long story, but I
went to go make two movies.

429
00:25:59,281 --> 00:26:02,670
I ended up taking about a month off from
the ring to go make these two movies

430
00:26:02,671 --> 00:26:05,490
and then was supposed to come back
while I was making the movies.

431
00:26:05,491 --> 00:26:07,620
One day I went to the gym to train and um,

432
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:12,300
it had gotten to a point where I couldn't
raise my left arm up over my shoulder

433
00:26:12,301 --> 00:26:16,740
and my neck was really bad and I'd
been going to see our team physician,

434
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:19,620
you know, the guy that runs our
medical. And I'd been, you know,

435
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:23,610
getting stuck with needles and die and
Mris and things and they kept saying like,

436
00:26:23,611 --> 00:26:27,240
it looks great. We don't see this
clearly something nerve going on here,

437
00:26:27,241 --> 00:26:31,260
but we don't know what it is.
And they kept doing all this stuff and

438
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:37,740
when the gym one day and tore my bicep
and it didn't hurt at all, it likes snap.

439
00:26:37,741 --> 00:26:41,790
I looked down, I have the big gap in my
arm. I was just mad more than anything.

440
00:26:41,791 --> 00:26:44,070
I was like, Oh, you just rolled up

441
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:46,110
like a Venetian blind toward the top.

442
00:26:46,111 --> 00:26:49,860
So just talk down and made like this
divot there. Right. And I heard,

443
00:26:49,861 --> 00:26:52,230
I had headphones on, I heard it
and I looked down and it was just

444
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:55,780
David, I was like, son of a bitch,
I can't believe you tore my bicep.

445
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:59,050
So I'm like mad. I put my weights down
and like literally I was done training.

446
00:26:59,051 --> 00:27:01,600
It was just going to do like a couple
of extra sets of Bicep to wherever and,

447
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:05,560
and uh,
I called the guy to come back and get me.

448
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:08,920
And as I went to go outside,
like I was sweating and out and piss off,

449
00:27:08,921 --> 00:27:11,920
just going to leave and I go to
put my sweatshirt on. And as I did,

450
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:13,150
I put my sweatshirt,

451
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:15,910
like through my arm up over my head to
put my sweatshirt on and realize it,

452
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:17,523
wait a minute,

453
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,380
I can move my,

454
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:23,260
my arm all the way
around my head like that.

455
00:27:23,261 --> 00:27:25,750
I couldn't do their shoulder
mobility. Yeah. I was like,

456
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:27,700
everything came back and hey,
wait my neck,

457
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:32,210
it doesn't hurt.
It was all from like this a bicep.

458
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:36,560
And um, I had to get surgery
and the whole thing and it,

459
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:40,400
but it got me to a point in my head like,
I'm getting older,

460
00:27:40,401 --> 00:27:42,590
I'm falling apart a little bit.
Like I have to start,

461
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:46,700
maybe I should think about trying to
train like an athlete instead of just like

462
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:50,360
going to the gym, being a bodybuilder
and just looking good or whatever.

463
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:56,260
So I'm not like a guy that just like to
call the local gym, like I have to them,

464
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:57,500
like dig into it.

465
00:27:57,501 --> 00:28:02,501
So I started like researching
trainers and everything and um,

466
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:04,810
okay.

467
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:05,501
Ironically,

468
00:28:05,501 --> 00:28:09,490
I ended up probably where you did in your
quest to do when you did for our body,

469
00:28:09,491 --> 00:28:12,760
which is you start researching all these
guys that become the best at what they

470
00:28:12,761 --> 00:28:17,500
do. And I, I come across Joe de Franco,
it keeps coming back up. Joda Franco.

471
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:22,150
So then I called Joe to Franco out of the
blue one day and just say, um, you know,

472
00:28:22,151 --> 00:28:23,620
hey, I was, I was actually,

473
00:28:23,621 --> 00:28:25,990
because he was in Jersey and I was in
Connecticut and I was thinking maybe he

474
00:28:25,991 --> 00:28:30,580
could recommend me to somebody. And uh,
he said, can I come and meet with you?

475
00:28:30,581 --> 00:28:33,110
I'd like to meet with you.
And just so I can analyze thing.

476
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:35,920
I still had my arm in a
sling and everything had just
finished making the movies.

477
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:40,000
I didn't have the surgery until after
I finish making the movies. And um,

478
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:44,560
he came and said, uh, after we met, he's
like, you seem like a really great guy.

479
00:28:44,561 --> 00:28:46,790
I like to take a stab at doing
this with you. I'll drive up here,

480
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:50,300
I'm willing to do it, drive up. And
uh, there's the thing, he's awesome.

481
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:53,720
He's a great guy. And for people
who aren't familiar, uh, he's,

482
00:28:53,721 --> 00:28:57,950
he's very well known for a lot of reasons,
but it does a lot of work with, uh,

483
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:01,670
football athletes training for
the NFL combine. Yeah. And, uh,

484
00:29:01,671 --> 00:29:05,060
that's how he ended up that the
chapters in the four hour body where I,

485
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:09,440
I showed how unathletic I am. Uh, but how
much Joe could improve my performance,

486
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:13,130
attempting to simulate the combine for,
for a handful of chapters.

487
00:29:13,131 --> 00:29:15,230
But please continue. I just want
to give some context for you. Yeah,

488
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:17,580
yeah, yeah. Great Guy. Yeah.

489
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:22,380
And I'm just wealth of knowledge,
incredibly smart.

490
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:25,920
And um, he said to me, um,

491
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:30,300
so this will be a difficult transition
for you because your mindset is totally

492
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:33,600
different. You know, I'd never been
with a strength and conditioning guy.

493
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:37,050
Everything I learned in the gym was from
bodybuilders were power lifters. I just,

494
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:40,440
I just went to the gym and trained with
guys and learned everything I could,

495
00:29:40,441 --> 00:29:44,500
but I was a sponge, you know,
Arnold was my hero and you know,

496
00:29:44,501 --> 00:29:48,370
I'd like just was a sponge for all that
stuff. But that's how I learned it.

497
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:52,870
So strength and conditioning and the
whole stretching and mobility was totally

498
00:29:52,871 --> 00:29:57,370
foreign to me. And he said, uh, this
is going to be a tough thing for you.

499
00:29:57,371 --> 00:30:00,640
We'll see if you can do it. Cause
tough with old dogs, new tricks.

500
00:30:00,641 --> 00:30:04,780
And I just want him. And I said,
dude, I will tell you this. I am,

501
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:08,770
I'm all in. Tell me what to do. I'll
go do it. But it changed my life,

502
00:30:08,771 --> 00:30:12,610
changed my life athletically. I
went from a guy with, you know,

503
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:15,790
gimping going upstairs because
my knees were killing me.

504
00:30:15,791 --> 00:30:18,700
I've torn both of my quads and my
knees were really bad and all that.

505
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:22,900
I had zero knee pain now as
strong as they've ever been.

506
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:28,240
I don't have physical issues,
but it's because of that type of training.

507
00:30:28,241 --> 00:30:32,410
And Joe and um, you know, he
was one of the guys that got me.

508
00:30:32,411 --> 00:30:34,120
Like when you do wrestle,
here's what we're going to do.

509
00:30:34,121 --> 00:30:36,740
We're going to get you in this kind
of shape and then you're going to,

510
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:40,290
he's going to be your pre match ritual of,
you know,

511
00:30:40,291 --> 00:30:43,000
you're stretching in your mobility.
We're going to light your body up,

512
00:30:43,001 --> 00:30:46,640
get your nerves kicking in and firing, and
then you're going to go, you know, and,

513
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:49,090
um, that's what I do now and it
works out a whole lot better.

514
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,630
Well, what are, what are,

515
00:30:50,631 --> 00:30:53,480
as opposed to going from the gorilla
position straight out to the, to the ring,

516
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:56,980
what are a, and I can prep what
I'll provide for folks. Uh,

517
00:30:56,981 --> 00:30:59,480
obviously lots of links to
everything that you're up to,

518
00:30:59,481 --> 00:31:04,360
but also I'll pin gel and get some links
to exercises and some videos. What,

519
00:31:04,361 --> 00:31:08,270
what does that look like now? What are
some of the exercises or the sequence?

520
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:12,510
It's, um, it's a lot of mobility
stuff. Kasik squats. Um,

521
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:17,880
you know, um, is that a weighted
caustic squatters? Oh, no,
he'll, well, it's depends,

522
00:31:17,881 --> 00:31:20,670
but usually I don't like if I'm
getting ready to go for a match,

523
00:31:20,671 --> 00:31:24,480
but like he'll have me do
caustic squats into, um,

524
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:26,880
maybe just like a, uh, a squat.

525
00:31:26,881 --> 00:31:30,180
But when I come down and pushing my knees
out to decide to stretch my groin out

526
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,210
into some type of like, um, uh,

527
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,810
he centric explosive pushup.

528
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:41,580
But just getting things to fire my
nervous system, wake my nervous system up,

529
00:31:41,581 --> 00:31:45,900
but then also just open my joints up
a little bit and just warm my body up.

530
00:31:45,901 --> 00:31:49,950
But it's never anything like I see guys
running down hallways and doing all

531
00:31:49,951 --> 00:31:54,600
these things to get a sweat going. I'm
never at that point. But when I'm done it,

532
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:57,750
I always feel like alive,
you know,

533
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:01,070
as opposed to just kind
of physically shutdown,

534
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:04,800
but mentally aware because I'm about
to go to the ring. So you know,

535
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:07,440
no matter how many years
you've been doing this,

536
00:32:07,441 --> 00:32:11,640
you still like nervous and
like freaking out and um,

537
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:17,070
to, to then have your body
just kick in and wake up,

538
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:19,740
boom when you're there. You know what
I mean? And that's really what it is.

539
00:32:19,741 --> 00:32:24,310
But it's, it's just the, he varies it,
but it's a little series of exercises.

540
00:32:24,311 --> 00:32:25,144
It just makes me go,

541
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:29,810
how long does it typically take? Five,
10 minutes. Not Short and sweet. Yeah.

542
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:32,700
It's not the, I just go white
right from one thing to the other.

543
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,120
Awesome. Good little
deal. Yeah. I'll Ping Joe.

544
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:40,080
So people you can find that at the
show notes at a four hour blog com. Uh,

545
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:42,200
the fear factor,

546
00:32:42,201 --> 00:32:45,620
what you guys do is it
can be very dangerous.

547
00:32:45,621 --> 00:32:47,960
I mean there are risks
involved when you're,

548
00:32:47,961 --> 00:32:52,100
when you're nervous or have been nervous.
Uh,

549
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:56,810
what is your inner dialogue sound like
when you're preparing yourself to go out,

550
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:59,600
when you've been most nervous?
What are you saying to yourself?

551
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:01,953
Um,

552
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:06,550
so it's changed over the years.

553
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:12,510
I used to get really intense and really
like almost like I'm that same level of

554
00:33:14,111 --> 00:33:14,711
intensity.

555
00:33:14,711 --> 00:33:19,711
If you are going to go for a personal
record squat or something where you know,

556
00:33:19,871 --> 00:33:24,280
you just get in that zone of intensity
and just nothing else is around you in

557
00:33:24,281 --> 00:33:28,920
your, in your own little world and just
on fire ready to tear through this thing.

558
00:33:28,921 --> 00:33:32,410
And that when I was younger,
that used to be the thing for me.

559
00:33:32,411 --> 00:33:37,411
Now it's much more of an inner dialogue
of you had been doing this for 20 years,

560
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:43,990
you know how to do this.
Like relax and this is fun.

561
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:49,180
Like, and in some way there's
that inner dialogue and me saying,

562
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:53,440
could be the last time you do this,
enjoy it. You know what I mean? Like,

563
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:59,470
um, uh, an undertaker and I
had a conversation a couple
of years ago about this,

564
00:33:59,471 --> 00:34:04,210
like, you, you, it's, it's a little
bit of like, you can still do this,

565
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:08,260
like in calming yourself down, but
at the same point in time, like,

566
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,780
don't forget to enjoy this moment,
like when you're out there,

567
00:34:10,781 --> 00:34:13,770
because you might not get another one.
You don't know. You know, and, and,

568
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:16,360
and injuries do happen,
especially as you get older. So,

569
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:19,690
and you can't think about it once you're
out there. And that's the thing for me,

570
00:34:19,691 --> 00:34:24,691
it's always been this emotion and nerve
and the s my music hits and the second I

571
00:34:26,261 --> 00:34:27,690
walk out, it's gone. Like,

572
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:30,640
I don't have any of it when I'm in
the ring waiting for the other guy or

573
00:34:30,641 --> 00:34:33,700
whatever. I don't have any of it. Um,

574
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:36,380
and it's an interesting thing to me that,
um,

575
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:41,320
I'm friends with Floyd Mayweather
and incredible athlete. Yeah.

576
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:43,880
And I was walking him to
the ring one time and, uh,

577
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:47,140
I think we fought Marquez and,
um,

578
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:50,830
we have the early in the guys came and
got me and I wanted to watch some of the

579
00:34:50,831 --> 00:34:53,290
undercard and then they came and got
me and they said, you know, Florida,

580
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:56,800
just want to say hi before he
starts getting ready and stuff.

581
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,210
Chat with me for a few
minutes. So I came, we,

582
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:01,570
Steph and I went backstage
with my wife and, um,

583
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,200
we in his locker room and he's laying
down on the couch watching basketball game

584
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:09,390
and we come in and say hello and all that.
And he's a guy I haven't seen,

585
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,930
you know,
now we're talking a little bit,

586
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:14,740
but I'm trying to be ultra respectful
of him. He's about to go in, you know,

587
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:20,020
massive fight. And so I, uh, the second,
there's like a lull in the conversation.

588
00:35:20,021 --> 00:35:20,651
I'm like,
all right man,

589
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:24,040
well we're going to get out of your hair
and head back in and we'll come back

590
00:35:24,041 --> 00:35:27,610
here when it's time for us to get ready
for your deal. And he's like, man,

591
00:35:27,611 --> 00:35:29,560
you don't gotta take off. She
could sit down and we're, I'm,

592
00:35:29,561 --> 00:35:32,860
I'm enjoying the conversation. Have
funny. And he's like completely relaxed.

593
00:35:32,861 --> 00:35:36,580
And I said, so another low
in the conversation, I go,
we're going to run flood. I,

594
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:38,250
I don't want to be in your way.
And he goes,

595
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:39,733
honor,

596
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:44,150
I'm telling you I'm not. I'm just
chilling, watching the game. And I said,

597
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:47,180
you're not wound up about this at all.
And he goes,

598
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:52,520
why would I be wound up?
I'm either ready or I'm not worrying

599
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:56,450
bottle right now. I get to
change a damn thing. Right?

600
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:59,260
It was going to happen. It's
going to happen here. Right.

601
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,780
So I've either done everything I
can to be ready for this or I'm not.

602
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:07,580
It's a fair point. I sat back down, we
watch a game. You're like, all right,

603
00:36:07,581 --> 00:36:12,440
I want to be here. Right? Yeah.
Just as very calm and relaxed.

604
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,290
And I think when you feel in
your mind that you're ready,

605
00:36:15,291 --> 00:36:19,190
you're ready and you're going
to have those nerves, but
it's, you know, it's there.

606
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:23,090
When you were coming up,
let's just say when you,

607
00:36:23,091 --> 00:36:26,610
when you would hit your stride
somewhat. So you're starting to, uh,

608
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:30,050
make the ascent through the
ranks and really become popular.

609
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:32,570
When you thought of the word successful,

610
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,340
who was the person in
your head at that time?

611
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:37,423
MMM,

612
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:39,301
I don't know.

613
00:36:39,301 --> 00:36:44,301
It's hard to say because I looked at an
inside of the inside of our business.

614
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:47,790
There were guys like for me, um, you know,

615
00:36:47,791 --> 00:36:51,750
my favorite performer
character was ric flair. Um,

616
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:56,760
just kind of felt like overall he had
the best package of everything to offer.

617
00:36:56,761 --> 00:37:00,000
You know, there were guys that
were great showman, very popular,

618
00:37:00,001 --> 00:37:02,130
or guys that were great
at one thing or Bobby,

619
00:37:02,131 --> 00:37:05,790
he had the kind of the Combo
of great in ring performer.

620
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,460
It made everybody look good,
does great character, all,

621
00:37:08,461 --> 00:37:11,490
all these things inside
the wrestling business.

622
00:37:11,491 --> 00:37:15,210
That was a component of success for me.
Um,

623
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:19,860
just that level of performer,
the way he handled himself in the ring.

624
00:37:19,861 --> 00:37:23,790
I always want it to be the in ring kind
of general and understand. And I just,

625
00:37:23,791 --> 00:37:26,790
one of the things I prided myself
on at the peak of my career was

626
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:28,493
mmm.

627
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:34,190
I could tell you at any
given time if there was six
people involved in something,

628
00:37:34,191 --> 00:37:35,480
I can tell you at any given time,

629
00:37:35,481 --> 00:37:39,470
if I close my eyes in the ring where they
all were like no matter how much they

630
00:37:39,471 --> 00:37:42,260
were moving around and what they
were doing, I knew where they were.

631
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,670
I knew what they had in their hands.

632
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:46,790
I knew like just on glimpses as
I was moving around the ring,

633
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:51,140
I always felt like it was my job.
If something was going to screw up,

634
00:37:51,141 --> 00:37:54,320
that was my fault. It wasn't because
he didn't know what was coming.

635
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:58,210
It was because I didn't control that.
Um,

636
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,450
so I was felling to control was mine to
take because it was what I could count

637
00:38:02,451 --> 00:38:04,700
on. I couldn't rely on, you know,

638
00:38:04,701 --> 00:38:07,760
this might get screwed up because maybe
there's a confusion between those two

639
00:38:07,761 --> 00:38:09,560
guys over there.
It's supposed to do their thing.

640
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:14,330
So I always took it on me to make sure
I was there to tell them this is coming

641
00:38:14,331 --> 00:38:19,230
up, be ready, here we go, get the
chair, whatever. You know, um,

642
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:22,190
flare was very good at that.
So that was like, for me,

643
00:38:22,191 --> 00:38:26,120
from that point of view was
a success, um, component.

644
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:28,460
But there was a lot of
things that I looked for.

645
00:38:28,461 --> 00:38:32,120
Wrestling didn't define me as
far as what I saw was successful.

646
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:35,950
I looked at and um, you know, I
looked at my, and one now Vince,

647
00:38:35,951 --> 00:38:40,951
I looked at that is a guy that
saw business that was one thing,

648
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,330
but had a vision of it
being something else.

649
00:38:43,331 --> 00:38:47,650
He saw this little territory business
and thought they should be one global

650
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:52,510
brand that everybody watches
because the world's getting smaller.

651
00:38:52,511 --> 00:38:53,770
Cable is taking over.

652
00:38:53,771 --> 00:38:58,771
And so he had this vision and then
he just kind of set out doing it.

653
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:00,130
I looked at Arnold,

654
00:39:00,131 --> 00:39:05,131
I remember as a kid reading education
of a bodybuilder and very structured,

655
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:11,200
methodical set of here's
what I want to do.

656
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:15,760
Here's what I want to be and here's
how I'm going to get there. You know,

657
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:22,200
that those kind of things in those kind
of people were success models for me.

658
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,340
Arnold.
Um,

659
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:28,660
was that in the structure?
You know,

660
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:31,510
I just said it to him a few weeks ago.
Like for me,

661
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:33,310
I say this in interviews a lot.

662
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:38,470
The Jim taught me everything I
need to know for life. You know,

663
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,930
I walked into Jim at 14,
I fell in love with it.

664
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:47,470
I fell in love with the end result.
Look right as always in awe of these big,

665
00:39:47,471 --> 00:39:51,070
powerful, impressive guys. I think it's
part of what I dug about wrestling.

666
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,113
You know,

667
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,690
I enjoyed the physical and all that
stuff of it and fell in love with that

668
00:39:55,691 --> 00:39:59,320
really holy, that's probably what
led me to the gym at first. But,

669
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:03,880
but just the discipline of
it and the going to the gym.

670
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:07,540
And when I say it's like life, the more
you put it in, the more you get out,

671
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:10,210
the harder you work, the
better the results, you know,

672
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:14,680
if you're willing to prepare to sacrifice.
It touches about going to the gym,

673
00:40:14,681 --> 00:40:16,930
lifting weights, and then going out
and goofing off. The rest of the time,

674
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,680
it's your life.
So if you discipline your diet,

675
00:40:20,681 --> 00:40:23,770
if you discipline your rest, if you
don't go to the party with your friends,

676
00:40:23,771 --> 00:40:28,360
if you don't do all these things,
your results follow suit. Um,

677
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:31,190
you know, I, I just did, um,

678
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:34,150
I just got inducted into the
international sports hall of fame.

679
00:40:34,151 --> 00:40:35,790
Arnold's international sports,
all friends.

680
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:40,340
But I bring it up because
Evander Holyfield was there
and he told his story and

681
00:40:40,341 --> 00:40:43,030
I never heard it said this way
before and I'm sorry of Andrew,

682
00:40:43,031 --> 00:40:46,520
but I'm going to steal this.
Um, he told me that, you know,

683
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:51,100
he was giving his speech and he said
that his coach at one point in time told

684
00:40:51,101 --> 00:40:54,470
them very, very first day, he
said, you could be Muhammad Ali,

685
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:58,740
you could be the next Muhammad
Ali. And uh, he said, do
you want to do that? And he,

686
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:02,170
he said he had to ask his mom and then
he went back home and he came back and he

687
00:41:02,171 --> 00:41:07,030
said, I want to do that. And he said,
okay, is that a dream or a goal?

688
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,600
This is a difference.
I'd never heard it said that way before,

689
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:13,750
but it struck to me so much so
that I've said it to my kid now.

690
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:19,770
Is that a dream or goal cause a dream to
something you fantasize about that just

691
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:21,821
will never happen?

692
00:41:21,821 --> 00:41:26,821
Probably the goal is something you set
a plan and work towards and achieve and

693
00:41:28,651 --> 00:41:30,630
set a dream or goal.
Um,

694
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:35,060
kind of always looked
at my stuff that way.

695
00:41:35,061 --> 00:41:38,810
So the people that were successful models
to me were people that had structured

696
00:41:38,811 --> 00:41:43,811
goals and then put a plan in
place to get to those things.

697
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,490
And I think that's what
impressed me about Arnold.

698
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:48,440
You weren't impressed me about
my father in law to this day.

699
00:41:48,441 --> 00:41:51,650
He's still very much a,
you know, here's the goal,

700
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:52,730
here's how I'm going to get there.

701
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:58,010
Energizer bunny. That's amazing. Yeah.
You guys seem like peas in a pod from us.

702
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,540
Stamina and endurance.
Stamina.

703
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:03,310
And do you, I've heard you say it before
when when you have that goal in mind,

704
00:42:03,311 --> 00:42:07,450
now it's not, I got to do this
thing to get that done. It's,

705
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:10,420
you can't wait to do that thing to get
that done because it's going to get you

706
00:42:10,421 --> 00:42:11,240
closer to your goal.

707
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:11,850
Right.
Well,

708
00:42:11,850 --> 00:42:16,670
since the compass that allows you
to find order in the chaos to the,

709
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:21,400
uh, parenting. I don't, I don't yet
have kids now that I know of. Uh,

710
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:24,320
at some point I would
love to have a family.

711
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:28,820
How do you think about being a father?
What type of father do you want to be?

712
00:42:28,821 --> 00:42:32,600
What do you think is, is
important in that, in that role?

713
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:38,340
That's a tough one. I have three
girls. Three, uh, I have, uh, an eight,

714
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:42,780
six and four. Very well spaced. Yeah.

715
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:48,600
And that's it. We're done.
Yeah. But, um, it's, man, it's,

716
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:53,010
it's hard when the pressure
as a parent, if you, you know,

717
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,860
hopefully if everybody takes the
job seriously, you know this,

718
00:42:56,010 --> 00:43:00,790
you're giving them the examples of
how they're going to live their life.

719
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:05,660
Kids don't do what you say.
They do what they see. Um,

720
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:09,630
so how you live your life. Is there an
example? You know, I've heard it said,

721
00:43:09,631 --> 00:43:14,631
and I believe this is like the way I treat
their mother and the way I treat them

722
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:20,190
is what they're going to look for in a,
in a significant other.

723
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:25,600
Um, well you got to think,
oh yeah, like so what are,

724
00:43:25,601 --> 00:43:27,750
what do I want them to have in their life?

725
00:43:27,751 --> 00:43:30,450
Holy cow and I got to do all
that stuff. It's a lot, you know,

726
00:43:30,451 --> 00:43:34,110
and then you add in all the other
things of life. It's a very,

727
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:39,090
it's a very difficult challenge.
Um, but you, you want to,

728
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:41,820
you want to teach them right from wrong.
You want to teach them,

729
00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:47,190
you want to give them a path and a
direction. But also same point in time,

730
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:51,360
you know, you learn as much from you
failures as you do from your successes.

731
00:43:51,361 --> 00:43:52,230
So you can't,

732
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:57,990
you can't give them everything that
you want to help them. Ouzo bad.

733
00:43:57,991 --> 00:44:00,240
Like I'm watching you make a
mistake and I want to help you,

734
00:44:00,241 --> 00:44:03,660
but go ahead and make the mistake because
you got to learn from that mistake.

735
00:44:03,661 --> 00:44:06,690
You know what I mean? Um,
and it's, it's tough to do,

736
00:44:06,691 --> 00:44:09,990
but you have to and there's no manual.
That's the hard thing about kids, right?

737
00:44:09,991 --> 00:44:14,010
There's no manual that comes with and
you're just doing the best you can.

738
00:44:14,011 --> 00:44:17,460
I remember when we got our first
one home, we, the boss battle,

739
00:44:17,461 --> 00:44:20,850
they put it in the car seat and you'd
take the thing home and then we walked in

740
00:44:20,851 --> 00:44:24,960
the door and we put it on the step
and we were like, what do we do now?

741
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:31,090
We just stood there looking at her for
a little bit like what, what do we like?

742
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:36,330
What do we do? Like eventually it, she
cried and he had a feeder and whatever.

743
00:44:36,370 --> 00:44:37,480
You don't know what to do.

744
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:41,960
We have a kid only cap.

745
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:47,730
Yeah. Luckily I was a,
I've got to go on the road.

746
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:59,010
The aspect of routines that we
touched on earlier, I'd love to, to,

747
00:44:59,110 --> 00:45:01,480
to bring back into focus for a second,
uh,

748
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:04,950
specifically morning
routines. What is, what,

749
00:45:04,951 --> 00:45:07,190
what does the first 60
minutes of your day look like?

750
00:45:07,191 --> 00:45:10,340
And I'll probably ask a bunch of really
irritating nit picky questions because

751
00:45:10,341 --> 00:45:13,460
that's how I am. But what does, what
does, what does, uh, when do you wake up?

752
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:17,840
What does the first 60 to 90 days, 60 to
90 minutes of your day look like? Yeah. So

753
00:45:17,850 --> 00:45:22,830
I, I wish I had a really cool example of
that. Like, you know, Robin don't wake up,

754
00:45:22,831 --> 00:45:25,140
I go on a Cryo Chamber,
Cryo Chamber. He's like,

755
00:45:25,141 --> 00:45:30,141
if this elaborate ritual
of mind altering spiritual,

756
00:45:30,241 --> 00:45:34,860
like jumping into a hot tank and a cold
tagging of mine involves my kids waking

757
00:45:34,861 --> 00:45:38,070
me up at an ungodly hour
after I, you know, like we,

758
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:43,710
we work under the premise
of my wife and I and to me,

759
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:47,640
she gets us even more than I do because
she's got all the roles and all this

760
00:45:47,641 --> 00:45:52,380
stuff and then she's mom. And
when you're the dad, it's,

761
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:57,090
it's, um, it's a big responsibility.
But the mom, like if anything happens,

762
00:45:57,091 --> 00:45:59,790
if they wake up, they go
to her first. You know,

763
00:45:59,791 --> 00:46:01,830
when the kids wake up in the middle
of the night, unless they're scared,

764
00:46:01,831 --> 00:46:03,090
they might call dad if they're scared.

765
00:46:03,091 --> 00:46:06,510
But usually it's mom because they
just more of the comforter, right?

766
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:11,340
So it's all those things. So
that's an even harder job. But,

767
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:15,420
um, you know, we, we train
late at night, we get home,

768
00:46:15,421 --> 00:46:17,400
we tried to get home every night,
no matter what,

769
00:46:17,401 --> 00:46:20,910
to spend a little bit of time with them
and put them down and, and, uh, you know,

770
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:22,530
read them a book,
whatever, get them in bed.

771
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:27,240
So Joe comes to my house around
10 o'clock. So by him, yeah.

772
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:31,560
So I get them done, you
know, we get them in bed, um,

773
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:35,760
change and then Joe's there and we start
training. And usually by, you know,

774
00:46:35,761 --> 00:46:39,150
by the time you warm up takes me a
while to warm up at 10 o'clock at night,

775
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:45,620
train and do all this stuff. By the time
we get done, usually it's one o'clock,

776
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:47,630
you know, in that ballpark.
And then, you know,

777
00:46:48,310 --> 00:46:52,980
you get in the bed after one o'clock,
they were up at like six at the latest,

778
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:56,550
you know, and they're in the room.
So there's no really cool ritual.

779
00:46:56,551 --> 00:46:58,320
I wish I could say
jumping in a cryo chamber.

780
00:46:58,321 --> 00:47:02,600
It's usually me stumbling
downstairs with them, um,

781
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,170
to try to make every
morning. My ritual is, um,

782
00:47:07,770 --> 00:47:12,240
I, um, I'm also ironically out
of your book, Dave Palumbo.

783
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:18,000
Jumbo Palumbo. Yeah. Dave has, I've been
friends with them for years and he, um,

784
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,380
he's a big um,
uh,

785
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:24,840
ketogenic diet guy.

786
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:28,310
So he like works with my diet a lot
when I'm getting ready for wrestlemania

787
00:47:28,311 --> 00:47:32,650
stuff. So Dave's kind of my diet guy uses
protein powder species protein is every

788
00:47:32,651 --> 00:47:37,060
morning roll downstairs,
two scoops of whey protein,

789
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:41,660
a bunch of Starbucks coffee,
powdered Starbucks coffee, uh,

790
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:45,490
some Macadamia nut oil and I make
a shake and that's the start.

791
00:47:45,491 --> 00:47:47,230
Like did you just got to
get the kick in the ass?

792
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:49,960
Starbucks macadamia nut oil.

793
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:52,840
What else was in there?
A two scoops of ice,

794
00:47:52,841 --> 00:47:57,841
ally's protein and some
ice blend it all up.

795
00:47:58,030 --> 00:48:01,570
It's a Starbucks,
a smoothie kind of concoction,

796
00:48:01,571 --> 00:48:05,800
but very healthy and has enough caffeine
in there to at least make me realize

797
00:48:05,830 --> 00:48:09,370
what's going on.
Get them ready for school.

798
00:48:09,371 --> 00:48:12,160
My wife and I get them ready for school,
uh,

799
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:16,900
jump in the shower either, depending if
I'm getting ready for like Wrestlemania,

800
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:21,250
it's either throw sweats on,
cause I'm gonna bring them to school.

801
00:48:21,251 --> 00:48:24,580
And then get a workout in because usually
I train twice a day when I'm getting

802
00:48:24,581 --> 00:48:28,210
ready for Wrestlemania or something,
but a train and then off to work.

803
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:32,170
If I'm not getting ready for Wrestlemania,
it's shower, get ready, suit,

804
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:36,430
bring them to school, you know, we drive
them to their school, get them to school,

805
00:48:36,431 --> 00:48:39,490
get them in their class to all this
stuff and then drive to the office,

806
00:48:39,491 --> 00:48:43,210
start the day, get home at, you know,

807
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,850
seven 38 o'clock at night and repeat.

808
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,320
And this is all in Connecticut is
they're all in Connecticut. Yeah,

809
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:52,020
indeed. The HQ is, I want to say
stem that can get this wrong.

810
00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:55,920
So Stanford is it separate is,
yeah. Yup. See it right from 95.

811
00:48:55,921 --> 00:48:59,940
Right off the highway. Close to the UBS
building. Yeah. Yeah. Down the street.

812
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:01,890
Not Far. And he used to lift
and I used to work there,

813
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,920
the slip of the tongue and lived there.
It's probably appropriate.

814
00:49:04,921 --> 00:49:08,820
He pretty much lived in the
office. What is your, uh,

815
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:12,510
what is your role currently at WWE in the,

816
00:49:12,690 --> 00:49:14,250
in the executive capacity?

817
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:18,530
So I am the executive
vice president of talent,

818
00:49:18,531 --> 00:49:20,450
live events and creative.

819
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:26,750
So if you look at the core
of what we do as a company,

820
00:49:26,751 --> 00:49:31,040
like from the product itself,
raw, smackdown, all that.

821
00:49:31,910 --> 00:49:36,910
And we're a lot more than that because
we have movies and music and like it's,

822
00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:40,610
I say all the time, it's like saying
Marvel's a comic book company.

823
00:49:40,611 --> 00:49:42,680
But that's the core of what we do.

824
00:49:44,390 --> 00:49:48,470
I control those aspects.
So talent and that goes from,

825
00:49:48,650 --> 00:49:50,180
we have a department tallow relations,

826
00:49:50,181 --> 00:49:54,020
which is like their HR and they handle
everything that has to do with talent

827
00:49:54,021 --> 00:49:55,440
from their travel to

828
00:49:57,470 --> 00:50:01,810
and anything that has to do with them.
All the logistics of Wrestlemania Week,

829
00:50:02,190 --> 00:50:05,150
you know, what talents are doing. There's
a thousand appearances for talent.

830
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:08,510
Literally in the week of Wrestlemania.

831
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:12,550
They have to handle all the logistics
of getting who were making sure nobody's

832
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:15,950
late and all of it. It's amazing. Um,

833
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:17,750
from to talent development,

834
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:22,100
which is the biggest probably thing
that's closest to my heart that I do,

835
00:50:22,101 --> 00:50:26,390
which is where do we find talent?
What are we re recruit them from?

836
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:30,680
Where do we, where do we, um,

837
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:35,780
where do we recruit them from?
How do we train them?

838
00:50:35,781 --> 00:50:38,970
We opened a performance center
in Orlando, Florida, um,

839
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:42,010
to a developmental territory
or a developmental, um,

840
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:47,170
system that I have called NXT that has
become kind of like an alternative brand,

841
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:48,703
um,

842
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:54,590
through to how do they then evolve and
get into the main roster of the WWE.

843
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:59,480
So basically what we did is kind of
created college football to get guys ready

844
00:50:59,481 --> 00:51:02,010
for the NFL. And then, um,

845
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:05,360
the last part of what I do is creative,

846
00:51:05,361 --> 00:51:10,250
which Vince is kind of the
ultimate filter of creative.

847
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:14,180
I'm more, um, while I,

848
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:17,630
I weigh in and a lot on that stuff and
the content that's going to go in the

849
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:20,900
network and all these things that I
weigh in on it from a creative concept.

850
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:26,200
But I'm also approving tee shirt designs
and banner designs and going through

851
00:51:27,051 --> 00:51:29,780
all that stuff through all the different
departments and doing the approvals of

852
00:51:29,781 --> 00:51:34,160
all that day to day process. Sounds like
quite a few hats. It's a lot of hats.

853
00:51:34,161 --> 00:51:34,701
It's funny,

854
00:51:34,701 --> 00:51:39,701
I used to marvel at Vince ability when
I first started coming in the office.

855
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:41,911
Um,
I,

856
00:51:41,911 --> 00:51:46,430
I've had a working kind of behind the
scenes relationship with Vince since

857
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:50,390
probably I started in the WWE
and 95 since like early 96.

858
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:54,080
I just was always fascinated with a behind
the scenes of the business and how it

859
00:51:54,081 --> 00:51:57,140
actually all came together as much
as I was doing it in the ring.

860
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:00,380
And he and I just kind
of clicked in that sense.

861
00:52:00,381 --> 00:52:03,230
And we started working together
and I didn't meet staff,

862
00:52:03,231 --> 00:52:07,280
his daughter until
quite a few years later.

863
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,730
And then we ended up having a
relationship and the whole thing.

864
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:15,320
But I had this working relationship
with Vince and as time went on and I got

865
00:52:15,321 --> 00:52:19,220
more and more involved in that and
then kind of later in my career,

866
00:52:19,221 --> 00:52:20,360
he kept always asking me like,

867
00:52:20,361 --> 00:52:22,700
when are you going to stop messing around
in the ring and come do some real work

868
00:52:22,701 --> 00:52:25,340
in the office? You know, you
need to be in the office.

869
00:52:25,341 --> 00:52:27,550
I need to get you in the office. And, um,

870
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:32,860
I used to marvel at how many hats he wore
and how quickly he could change them.

871
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:34,101
You know,

872
00:52:34,101 --> 00:52:39,101
he'd be talking about a foreign
tour and box office receipts or,

873
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:43,850
or you know, I'm a touring strategy
or marketing strategy for that.

874
00:52:43,851 --> 00:52:45,130
And then two seconds
later he's looking at it,

875
00:52:45,131 --> 00:52:48,470
a tee shirt design and approving colors
and that, and then that would go away.

876
00:52:48,471 --> 00:52:52,100
And now he's, he's, you know, looking
at some new talent or he's like,

877
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:55,310
it's just was so many hats that he,

878
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:58,700
that he wore and it used to amaze me
how quickly he could change gears and I

879
00:52:58,701 --> 00:53:03,470
find myself now having to
do that same thing. Um,

880
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:04,401
and it's,

881
00:53:04,401 --> 00:53:07,100
it's really cool to see yourself growing
that way cause they used to think about

882
00:53:07,101 --> 00:53:08,360
how does he keep that all straight.

883
00:53:08,361 --> 00:53:11,660
And at first I couldn't keep it straight
and now you just, you learn it, you know,

884
00:53:11,661 --> 00:53:15,320
you, you, you learned that
you adapt to that process.

885
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:18,230
I know we only have a few minutes left.

886
00:53:18,231 --> 00:53:20,330
I feel like I can ask
you questions for hours.

887
00:53:20,331 --> 00:53:24,800
So maybe we'll do a round two sometimes.
I love it. This is great. The,

888
00:53:24,801 --> 00:53:25,980
I'd love to ask you some rapid

889
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:27,520
fire questions and,
uh,

890
00:53:27,790 --> 00:53:30,120
I think we could do an entire
session just on productivity,

891
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,090
but just really quickly,
what is the,

892
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:34,950
the book that you have
gifted most to other people?

893
00:53:35,910 --> 00:53:36,290
Okay.

894
00:53:36,290 --> 00:53:39,530
Or any book you've gifted
a lot to other people. Um

895
00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:45,623
hmm.

896
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:48,700
I don't know that I could answer that
question. I don't give books, watch.

897
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:54,780
Not a problem. Well, you, my friends
aren't big readers need to work on that.

898
00:53:54,781 --> 00:53:57,360
We can come back to that. What, uh, what,

899
00:53:57,690 --> 00:54:02,280
what band or song have you been
playing most on your iPhone or,

900
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,350
or, uh, in the car or otherwise?

901
00:54:04,850 --> 00:54:09,280
It's lot lately it's been anything heavy.
Metallica, Motorhead, I'm, you know,

902
00:54:09,281 --> 00:54:11,450
I'm in training mode for Wrestlemania,
so I,

903
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:16,580
I at 10 o'clock at night I need to put
something on the stereo that just makes

904
00:54:16,581 --> 00:54:18,890
me,
gets me an ass kicking mode.

905
00:54:19,850 --> 00:54:20,220
Uh,

906
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:25,080
if you could only do one or two physical
exercises for the rest of your life

907
00:54:25,081 --> 00:54:26,100
movements,
what would they be?

908
00:54:28,270 --> 00:54:32,710
Wow. Um, I think if, if,

909
00:54:32,711 --> 00:54:36,400
if at this age,
if I could do like a free standing,

910
00:54:36,401 --> 00:54:39,600
just bodyweight squats and pushups and,
um,

911
00:54:39,790 --> 00:54:43,000
kind of bodyweight exercises would be
where I'd be at because I think you can

912
00:54:43,001 --> 00:54:47,080
stay in phenomenal shape doing them and
you don't need a whole lot of space or

913
00:54:47,081 --> 00:54:47,914
equipment.

914
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:49,410
I should dive at some point.

915
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:52,460
Introduce juicy to a buddy of mine named
Travis brewer who is a top competitor

916
00:54:52,461 --> 00:54:55,580
on American Ninja Warrior and you
guys could, could trade work outs.

917
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:56,390
I think that'd be amazing.

918
00:54:56,390 --> 00:54:58,580
Yeah. Easily. Yeah, I
bet you that's awesome

919
00:54:59,020 --> 00:55:01,990
monster. I bet. What advice,

920
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:06,700
this will be the last question before I
ask you where people can find out more

921
00:55:06,701 --> 00:55:11,200
about you online, but, uh, what advice
would you give your 20 year old self?

922
00:55:15,090 --> 00:55:19,980
Don't take it all so serious, you
know, and, and, and be more open.

923
00:55:20,990 --> 00:55:24,350
Um, it's, it's man,

924
00:55:24,351 --> 00:55:28,450
when you're so focused on
making it and you're, um,

925
00:55:28,670 --> 00:55:31,670
I always had fun in the business and
it was one of the things that I like.

926
00:55:31,671 --> 00:55:34,220
I could, I, I can look
at it now and say like,

927
00:55:34,221 --> 00:55:37,760
I didn't take everything so seriously
that it was detrimental to me,

928
00:55:37,761 --> 00:55:42,620
but like there were times when it just,
something happened and just eat me up,

929
00:55:42,650 --> 00:55:45,190
you know what I mean?
And I would be call. Yes.

930
00:55:45,230 --> 00:55:50,060
Just couldn't take it because I was so
hungry to get to that next place. And,

931
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:54,310
um,
there you need to keep that,

932
00:55:54,730 --> 00:55:58,480
that perspective of where
everything lays out. You know,

933
00:55:58,750 --> 00:56:00,190
there's times when I,
uh,

934
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:05,880
when over the years when we've looked
at each other and my friends within the

935
00:56:06,281 --> 00:56:07,810
business,
little group of guys,

936
00:56:07,811 --> 00:56:10,600
and we'd always look at each other and
at a certain point in time you just laugh

937
00:56:10,601 --> 00:56:15,220
and go like, hey, it's the phony fight
business. We're wrestling our underwear,

938
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:17,860
you know what I mean? Like, what
am I getting all worked up about?

939
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:19,353
You know what I mean?

940
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:20,670
And,
and

941
00:56:20,670 --> 00:56:25,240
I think that that is the biggest thing
is just not taking it so seriously.

942
00:56:25,241 --> 00:56:27,970
And then, and then being open
to stuff. You know, it's funny,

943
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:32,860
I mentioned that I listened to the Anthony
Robbins interview with you and I was

944
00:56:32,861 --> 00:56:33,551
fascinated with it.

945
00:56:33,551 --> 00:56:38,050
I met Anthony one time
and it was probably 2000.

946
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:44,820
I was just kinda like getting to a high
spot in my career and just happened to

947
00:56:45,041 --> 00:56:47,770
be in a hotel. I look over next to
me, he's checking in next minute.

948
00:56:47,930 --> 00:56:50,630
It's just a big giant
dude, you know? And uh,

949
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:53,860
but I recognize him from TV and he looked
over at me and said, how you doing?

950
00:56:53,861 --> 00:56:54,950
I'm great. How are you? Good.

951
00:56:54,951 --> 00:56:59,951
And then he got my keys and I went and
get in the elevator and he gets in the

952
00:57:00,071 --> 00:57:03,060
elevator with me and he
looked at me and said, um,

953
00:57:05,170 --> 00:57:06,700
forgive me. I don't know.
I don't know what you do,

954
00:57:06,701 --> 00:57:10,150
but I clearly see people looking at you
and I clearly see your somebody and I

955
00:57:10,151 --> 00:57:14,140
don't what, what do you do? And so I tell
them who I am and what I do. And I said,

956
00:57:14,141 --> 00:57:18,760
I've seen you on TV, you
know, and um, you know,

957
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:21,640
one of those two second chance
meetings in an elevator, right?

958
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:25,660
And this really impressed me that I get
back a couple of weeks later and I get a

959
00:57:25,661 --> 00:57:30,661
big box of like the cassette and his books
and all his stuff that he had written

960
00:57:30,881 --> 00:57:34,210
me this handwritten letter and sent it,
didn't know how to get ahold of me,

961
00:57:34,211 --> 00:57:36,730
send it to the WWE office,
whatever, two weeks,

962
00:57:36,731 --> 00:57:39,520
a month later when I come back through
the office at some point in time in my

963
00:57:39,521 --> 00:57:43,000
travels, they give it to me and
I'm like, wow, this is amazing.

964
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:48,300
I was too young and stupid and unopened
at the time to foster a relationship or

965
00:57:49,150 --> 00:57:52,990
I listened to the tapes and I,
and I read the books and all that stuff.

966
00:57:52,991 --> 00:57:53,890
And if I'd have thought about it,

967
00:57:53,891 --> 00:57:56,620
maybe I would have reached back
out to say thank you and like, hey,

968
00:57:56,621 --> 00:57:58,600
like this is really cool.
Can you know?

969
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:03,040
And he invited me to one of
his seminars and, and you know,

970
00:58:03,041 --> 00:58:05,800
I was just at that time like I'm
doing good. Like I don't, you know,

971
00:58:06,790 --> 00:58:09,820
it was close to it.
I wish I was more open to it.

972
00:58:09,850 --> 00:58:14,800
I wish I could have had the bandwidth to
not be so absorbed in what I was doing

973
00:58:14,801 --> 00:58:18,580
and my moments going for that I could
have said by this guy who could teach me

974
00:58:18,581 --> 00:58:22,150
so much and Matt I should
call it. And just, you know,

975
00:58:22,170 --> 00:58:25,190
to foster that relationship
cause he, he put the, put the,

976
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:29,240
put the handout and I was a guy who
know I don't need to him, you know, and,

977
00:58:29,241 --> 00:58:31,480
and it's, um, and those
are things that I look,

978
00:58:31,810 --> 00:58:34,060
there's other opportunities in
my life that I wish, Oh man,

979
00:58:34,061 --> 00:58:36,580
I wish that was right in front of
me and I could have grabbed that,

980
00:58:36,581 --> 00:58:40,420
but I was too narrow minded
to see it, you know? Well,

981
00:58:41,230 --> 00:58:43,120
this has been fascinating
and you're fascinating guy.

982
00:58:43,750 --> 00:58:46,780
I would love to do around two sometime,
but we're out of time.

983
00:58:47,170 --> 00:58:51,150
I know your schedules
incredibly impressive to me. Ah,

984
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:56,170
where can people find more about you
online? Say Hi and so on. It's uh,

985
00:58:56,230 --> 00:58:59,820
so uh, Twitter, uh, what,
what's my Twitter handle?

986
00:58:59,821 --> 00:59:04,780
It's like a triple H.
I don't know.

987
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:10,660
I just know how to push the buttons
on it. I don't use search, easy peasy.

988
00:59:10,930 --> 00:59:14,260
ww.com is for our, our, um,

989
00:59:14,650 --> 00:59:18,330
for our company and our site
and all that. Um, you know,

990
00:59:18,370 --> 00:59:21,380
I do stuff on Twitter and whether anybody
believes in or not, I actually do it.

991
00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:24,470
It's not somebody else doing it. It's
me. So if it's terrible, it was me.

992
00:59:24,471 --> 00:59:28,580
If it was really good, it
was me. Um, you know, uh,

993
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:32,420
if you want us to go back
and look at my career, um,

994
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:35,210
the WWE network is a great place to do it.

995
00:59:35,210 --> 00:59:39,470
All the historical content is
on there. Um, you know, that's,

996
00:59:39,471 --> 00:59:42,800
that's really me. But, uh,
you know, for me, I'm a,

997
00:59:43,910 --> 00:59:45,290
I know you say,
I'm fascinated,

998
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:49,110
I'm fascinated by this process and
what you do and how you do it. Um,

999
00:59:49,550 --> 00:59:52,730
and I'd love to do this again because I
think these kinds of things, it's funny,

1000
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:56,060
a lot of things I said in here when
you ask me questions today, like I'm,

1001
00:59:56,690 --> 01:00:01,510
I feel like I gave you long
winded answers. I apologize
if I did, but like, so I'm,

1002
01:00:01,530 --> 01:00:03,930
I'm almost,
I'm almost explaining it to myself as you.

1003
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,270
Well,
like I never thought about it that way,

1004
01:00:05,271 --> 01:00:08,470
so I'm kind of explaining it to you going
like, yeah, that's really cool. You know,

1005
01:00:08,630 --> 01:00:12,230
not long winded at all. They were,
uh, you're a great storyteller.

1006
01:00:12,231 --> 01:00:15,740
You're a great story creator, uh, an
incredible performer and I hope I am,

1007
01:00:16,130 --> 01:00:17,240
I'll never be as big as you,

1008
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:21,200
but hopefully I will be as bulletproof as
you are when I'm 45 so until next time.

1009
01:00:21,201 --> 01:00:22,700
Thank you so much.
Thank you very much man.
