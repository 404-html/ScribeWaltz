1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,830
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02,831 --> 00:00:06,010
I can run flat out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:15,090
I'm a cybernetic organism
living to show a medal.

4
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:28,840
This episode is brought to you by Peloton
and I'd heard about Peloton over and

5
00:00:28,841 --> 00:00:33,310
over again, but I ended up getting
a Peloton bike in the whole system.

6
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:37,690
After I saw my buddy Kevin Rose, I've
known him forever, some of you know,

7
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:42,720
and he showed up at my gate at my house
a while back and he looked fantastic.

8
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:48,010
I asked him as it, dude, you look great,
what the hell have you been up to?

9
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,110
Because he's always doing
a weird diet or another,

10
00:00:50,111 --> 00:00:51,670
but it only lasts like a week or two.

11
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,480
So he always regresses to the mean
after like 75 beers and he said,

12
00:00:55,481 --> 00:00:58,060
I've been doing Peloton
five days a week now.

13
00:00:58,061 --> 00:01:02,740
That caught my attention because Kevin
does nothing five days a week and you

14
00:01:02,741 --> 00:01:06,010
know, I love you Kevin, but
it really peaked my curiosity,

15
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:11,070
ended up getting a system and it's
become an integral part of my week.

16
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:15,940
I love it and I really didn't expect to
love it at all because I find cycling

17
00:01:15,941 --> 00:01:17,620
really boring usually,

18
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:22,630
but peloton is an indoor cycling bike
that brings live studio classes right into

19
00:01:22,631 --> 00:01:23,464
your home.

20
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,050
You don't have to worry about fitting
classes into your schedule or making it to

21
00:01:26,051 --> 00:01:28,090
a studio with some type of commute,

22
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:32,620
etc. New classes are added every day and
this includes options led by elite New

23
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,120
York City instructors
in your own living room.

24
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:38,110
You can even livestream studio classes
taught by the world's best instructors or

25
00:01:38,111 --> 00:01:41,140
find your own favorite
class on demand and in fact,

26
00:01:41,141 --> 00:01:45,370
Kevin and I rarely do live classes
and you can compete with your friends,

27
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,800
which is also fun. Kevin,
I'm coming after you,

28
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,160
but we usually just use classes on demand.

29
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:56,080
I really like Matt [inaudible] and his
eye in high intensity training sessions

30
00:01:56,081 --> 00:01:56,770
that are shorter,

31
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:01,770
like 20 minutes and I think
Kevin's favorite is Alex
and everyone seems to have

32
00:02:02,531 --> 00:02:06,940
their favorite instructor or you can
select by music duration and so on.

33
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:11,950
Each Peloton bike includes a 22 inch
HD touchscreen performance tracking

34
00:02:11,951 --> 00:02:12,461
metrics.

35
00:02:12,461 --> 00:02:16,750
I think that that along with the realtime
leaderboard are the main reasons that

36
00:02:16,751 --> 00:02:21,430
this caught my attention when cycling
never had caught my attention before.

37
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:24,940
It's really pretty stunning what they've
done with the user interface to keep

38
00:02:24,941 --> 00:02:25,774
your attention.

39
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:29,860
The belt drive is quiet and it's smaller
than you would expect so it can fit in

40
00:02:29,861 --> 00:02:33,850
a living room or an office.
I actually have it in a large closet,

41
00:02:33,851 --> 00:02:37,240
believe it or not and
it fits with no problem.

42
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:42,250
So peloton is offering all of you guys,
listeners of the Tim Ferriss show,

43
00:02:42,251 --> 00:02:47,251
a special offer and it is actually special

00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,090
You might say Matt accessories.
Wait,

47
00:03:01,091 --> 00:03:05,740
I don't need fancy towels or whatever
other supplemental bits and pieces.

48
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,930
No,
the shoes you need,

49
00:03:07,931 --> 00:03:10,960
you need the clip in shoes and
those are in the accessory category.

50
00:03:10,961 --> 00:03:14,860

59
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,213
Yeah,

60
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,750
this episode is brought
to you by zip recruiter.

61
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,110
You may have heard them everywhere.
They're growing like crazy.

62
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,800
They're an innovative platform
for doing several things,

63
00:04:01,801 --> 00:04:05,760
but especially improving
the hiring process,

64
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:08,310
making it slick and elegant and easy.

65
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:11,160
One of the hardest parts
of running any business,

66
00:04:11,161 --> 00:04:15,450
growing any business is finding
and hiring the right team.

67
00:04:15,451 --> 00:04:20,130
I've seen this firsthand in close
to a hundred startups. Now, God,

68
00:04:20,131 --> 00:04:24,450
I'm getting old from all over the
world at different stages of growth and

69
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:29,340
nothing can quite drain your resources
and costs you time and money,

70
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,820
like making mistakes
in hiring ZipRecruiter,

71
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:38,010
develop their own system and their own
platform for helping you to solve two of

72
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:40,350
the biggest problems and
bottlenecks for employers,

73
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:45,920
posting jobs easily and then making it
even easier to find the best candidates.

74
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,510
Unlike other job sites,

75
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:52,290
zip recruiter does in effect the
opposite of what you'd expect.

76
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:56,370
So they do not depend on
candidates finding you there.

77
00:04:56,371 --> 00:04:59,790
Technology finds the right
candidate for you and in fact,

78
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:03,630
more than 80% of the jobs posted on
ZipRecruiter returnee qualified candidate

79
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:07,860
based on your criteria that
you select in just 24 hours.

80
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:12,120
So no more juggling email, reviewing
hundreds of unqualified candidates.

81
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,260
I've been there,
done that.

82
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:17,100
Don't recommend it or dealing with calls
to the office, et Cetera. None of that.

83
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:22,020
Simply screen rate and manage
your candidates all in one
place on Ziprecruiter's

84
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:25,680
dashboard and as a listener
of the Tim Ferriss show.

85
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:29,880
Thanks for that zip recruiter wants
to allow you to start posting jobs and

86
00:05:29,881 --> 00:05:32,730
trying their services for free,
so if you're thinking of hiring somebody,

87
00:05:32,731 --> 00:05:35,870
you need to find any an executive
assistant, you need to find a developer,

88
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,680
whatever it might be tried up.

89
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:42,740

Hello,

94
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,640
boys and girls and demoss he caballeros.

95
00:06:01,641 --> 00:06:04,940
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another
episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

96
00:06:04,941 --> 00:06:08,270
it is my job to deconstruct world class
performers of all different types to

97
00:06:08,271 --> 00:06:10,940
tease out the tactics, habits,
routines and so on that you can use.

98
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:16,070
I am recording this intro and a Mexican
airport after a top secret retreat doing

99
00:06:16,071 --> 00:06:19,550
top secret things, and maybe I'll
talk more about that sometime,

100
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:22,640
but this episode you're going to hear
is with one of my favorite people,

101
00:06:22,641 --> 00:06:27,641
Tim O'reilly and I recorded this sometime
ago and held onto it like a piece of

102
00:06:27,651 --> 00:06:32,480
gold to my chest to release at the
right time at Tim O'reilly on Twitter.

103
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,870
It's one of the most fascinating
polymaths and autodidacts,

104
00:06:35,871 --> 00:06:39,440
one of the most curious
minds I've ever encountered.

105
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:44,500
He's been called the trend spotter in
the world of tech and certainly involving

106
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:48,500
wider macrotrends. He's been called
the oracle of Silicon Valley.

107
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:52,070
He is the founder and CEO
of O'reilly Media Inc.

108
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:54,110
His original business
plan was pretty simple,

109
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:57,530
interesting work for interesting people
and that's worked out pretty well.

110
00:06:57,531 --> 00:07:00,830
He's generated hundreds of millions
of dollars in revenue at doing many,

111
00:07:00,831 --> 00:07:04,040
many different things around the media,
delivers online learning, publishes books,

112
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:07,850
runs conferences or just companies to
create more value than they capture and

113
00:07:07,851 --> 00:07:11,150
tries to change the world by spreading
and amplifying the knowledge of

114
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:16,040
innovators. But as he would say himself,
one of my favorite quotes of his,

115
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:19,250
sorry for the noise. This is some
audio verite for all of you guys,

116
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,540
but he would say quote money in
a business like gas in a car.

117
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,870
You don't want to run out, but you're
not doing a tour of gas stations.

118
00:07:26,871 --> 00:07:28,340
And we talk quite a bit about that.

119
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:33,260
Tim has an incredible history of
convening conversations that reshape the

120
00:07:33,261 --> 00:07:36,920
computer industry in
93 that's 1993 for you.

121
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,990
Youngins he launched the first commercial
website that was very Sean Connery,

122
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,410
the first commercial website.

123
00:07:42,411 --> 00:07:46,450
And then in [inaudible] 98 he organized
the meeting where the term open source.

124
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:52,160
I've been speaking too much, Gus the
Yanno. My English is not happening.

125
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:55,760
Open source software. My
God, let's try that again.

126
00:07:55,761 --> 00:07:58,210
He organized the meeting
where the term open source,

127
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:04,510
I swear to God, I'm not drunk
guys. Open source software.

128
00:08:04,511 --> 00:08:07,820
It was agreed on and help the business
world understand its importance.

129
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:10,700
In 2004 with the web 2.0 summit.

130
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:15,050
He defined how web 2.0 represented not
only the resurgence of the web after

131
00:08:15,051 --> 00:08:19,490
the.com bust, but entirely new model for
the computer industry based on big data,

132
00:08:19,491 --> 00:08:21,830
collective intelligence and
the Internet as a platform.

133
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:26,420
Web 2.0 is actually one of the conferences
where the four hour workweek reached

134
00:08:26,421 --> 00:08:29,540
it's tipping point,
so also thank you to Tim for that.

135
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:33,560
In 2009 with his Gov 2.0 summit,

136
00:08:33,561 --> 00:08:37,100
he framed the conversation around the
modernization of government technology

137
00:08:37,101 --> 00:08:40,040
that is shaped policy and spot
initiatives at the federal,

138
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:42,050
state and local level
and all around the world.

139
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:47,150
He has now turned his attention and is
very focused on artificial intelligence,

140
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:49,400
the implications,
artificial intelligence,

141
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,910
the on demand economy and
other technologies that are
transforming the nature of

142
00:08:52,911 --> 00:08:56,170
work and the future shape
of the business world.

143
00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:01,170
He really has a both a 30,000
foot view of the larger shifts,

144
00:09:03,421 --> 00:09:06,240
the tectonic shifts that will
produce changes in 10, 20,

145
00:09:06,241 --> 00:09:11,241
30 years but is also on the ground and
really in touch with the people who are

146
00:09:12,631 --> 00:09:17,610
shaping the details of how that will
come to pass. And uh, his brand new book,

147
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,000
which I encourage everybody
to check out his WTF,

148
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:23,850
what's the future and why it's up to us.

149
00:09:23,851 --> 00:09:27,990
And I will link to all of that in
the show notes of course. And if you,

150
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,550
if you'd like to Kevin Kelly,

151
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:34,260
he is a bird of a feather with
this fine jet, Tim O'Reilly.

152
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:38,550
So without further ado, please enjoy
this very wide ranging extremely for me.

153
00:09:38,551 --> 00:09:42,210
Certainly enjoyable
conversation with Tim O'reilly.

154
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:49,810
Tim, welcome to the show. Thank you for
making the time. Thanks for having me.

155
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:55,230
I have been looking forward to this for
some time and most recently your name

156
00:09:56,801 --> 00:10:01,801
came up because I was in a car in
the back mountains surrounding.

157
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:03,610
Part of it was Becca,

158
00:10:03,611 --> 00:10:08,611
Stan with Kevin Kelly and our friend
Kevin Kelly on a very short list.

159
00:10:09,581 --> 00:10:12,880
When I asked him, who do you think I
should absolutely have on the podcast?

160
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,910
Tim O'reilly was one of
the names that came up.

161
00:10:15,911 --> 00:10:18,490
So I also leaned on Kevin for some,

162
00:10:18,491 --> 00:10:21,550
some deep intel and suggested
topics and questions.

163
00:10:21,551 --> 00:10:23,830
But I thought I would start
with what's on everyone's mind,

164
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:28,420
which is why are you
similar to cookie monster?

165
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:34,480
Yes. Well, I often joke about myself,

166
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:38,770
uh, you know, as a VC and
a business person, uh,

167
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,030
that I'm a little bit like the,
um,

168
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:46,870
some episode I remember for my kids
were little on cookie monster. I made,

169
00:10:46,871 --> 00:10:48,220
I have this completely right,

170
00:10:48,221 --> 00:10:52,030
but he's on a game show and
he has to pick his prize.

171
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:56,140
And behind door number one is $1 million
and they tell him that behind door

172
00:10:56,141 --> 00:10:59,260
number two is a chateau in France.

173
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,780
And behind door number three is a cookie.

174
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:04,560
And of course everybody
knows what he picks. And,

175
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:08,790
and what I like to say about myself is
that I always go for the cookie. Uh,

176
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:12,460
you know, because in some sense,
you know, what I really care about,

177
00:11:12,461 --> 00:11:17,461
what's my cookie is a finding people who
are doing something new and interesting

178
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,790
that I think other people want to know
about and that they can learn from.

179
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:25,120
And you know, my whole business
has been built around, you know,

180
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:29,350
finding people who have cookies
and then sharing it with the world.

181
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,160
So not,

182
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:35,700
not to take the cookie
monster discussion too far,

183
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,020
but you didn't know this.

184
00:11:38,021 --> 00:11:43,021
I happened to be standing in a house
where seasons one through 10 of sesame

185
00:11:44,951 --> 00:11:46,180
street.
We're partly written.

186
00:11:46,181 --> 00:11:51,181
So many of the characters including cookie
monster were actually written where I

187
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:55,420
am standing. So it's coming back
amazing. So it's come full circle.

188
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,810
And when I bought the house,
they were going to throw everything out.

189
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,120
The former owners,

190
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:05,080
including a season one staff
jacket for sesame street,

191
00:12:05,081 --> 00:12:10,060
which of course I kept and uh,
that is hanging in the doorway.

192
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:15,120
But when we come back to ideas and we'll
certainly spend a lot of time talking

193
00:12:15,641 --> 00:12:20,641
about publishing in many things that
are perhaps a little more recent in your

194
00:12:21,671 --> 00:12:22,090
life,

195
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:27,090
but I want to rewind the clock a bit
and to start maybe with an odd story.

196
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:32,980
Could you tell me about how your father,

197
00:12:32,981 --> 00:12:36,730
who my understanding was in neurologist
also deeply religious injected

198
00:12:36,731 --> 00:12:41,380
radioactive copper isotopes into your arm?
Is that a true story?

199
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:46,390
Has Absolutely.
Tell me I need some work on tax done.

200
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:51,190
It wasn't my dad who injected them. It
was a guy named Leroy Shipley. He was the,

201
00:12:51,191 --> 00:12:56,100
the lab tech and Oh my God,
he was amazing. He was very
funny. But, uh, I was, uh,

202
00:12:56,130 --> 00:13:00,420
my best friend that I, and my best
friend's sisters when I was 14 there,

203
00:13:00,421 --> 00:13:03,550
the girls were a little
older, uh, agreed to, um,

204
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:08,730
participate in a study of
Wilson's disease, which was,

205
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:13,110
it is a disease of the abnormal
retention of copper in the body.

206
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:16,110
It's a genetic disease.
Um, my dad was a, you know,

207
00:13:16,111 --> 00:13:20,730
sort of a pioneer in early genetic
medicine, also radio medicine and,

208
00:13:20,731 --> 00:13:23,790
uh, Wilson's disease was
one of his specialties.

209
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:28,200
And so they needed to have
control subjects to understand
how copper is excreta

210
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:32,070
normally. And so they would
inject us with radioactive copper.

211
00:13:32,071 --> 00:13:36,910
And then every day we went in and lay
in this room with, it was massive thing,

212
00:13:36,911 --> 00:13:39,210
you know,
it wasn't like today's a Mris,

213
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,980
but it was just this whole room that was
called a whole body counter. And they,

214
00:13:42,981 --> 00:13:47,590
they, they kind of traced where the copper
went accumulates in the liver, uh, in,

215
00:13:47,591 --> 00:13:51,090
in, uh, and then in the brain
of people with Wilson's disease.

216
00:13:51,091 --> 00:13:54,660
And it's normally excrete it, uh,
after, uh, about, uh, you know,

217
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,080
some relatively small amount of time.
So it was copper 64.

218
00:13:58,081 --> 00:14:03,030
It's got a half life or a few weeks.
And so I presumably it was all gone.

219
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:07,110
Uh, but if I ever come down with liver
cancer, I may have my father to blame,

220
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:12,150
but we think we actually did
it twice. Uh, but, and again,

221
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:14,640
he obviously took some thought
about whether it was safe,

222
00:14:14,641 --> 00:14:17,530
because once we became lab rats for him,
uh,

223
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,850
there were other researchers who wanted
us to do other experiments and he,

224
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:24,360
you know, said, no, I don't want you
to do that one. That doesn't seem,

225
00:14:24,361 --> 00:14:28,900
seem right to me. So, uh, he of course,
used himself as a Guinea pig for, uh,

226
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,020
for, uh, his experiments.

227
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,270
What did your mother do? I mean,
you had, as I understand it,

228
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:41,390
let's see, seven children total in the
family. That's correct. What did your,

229
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:44,960
I mean, that's certainly a fulltime job
just to take care of the kids, but what,

230
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:48,540
what did your mom spend
her time doing primarily?

231
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:52,910
Uh, you know, I think taking
care of seven is huge.

232
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,740
I still remember her,

233
00:14:55,250 --> 00:15:00,170
one of my memories of my mom is her on
her hands and knees in the bathroom,

234
00:15:00,171 --> 00:15:04,640
scrubbing the toilet, and she looks up
and says, life is not a bowl of cherries

235
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,120
are. Of course, the idea
of my mom, uh, like,

236
00:15:10,121 --> 00:15:15,121
that brings up another great story
about the time that she likes to tell.

237
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,720
Uh, she was apparently, uh, you know,

238
00:15:17,721 --> 00:15:22,490
up on a piano stool trying to dust
a light. And she fell flat on that.

239
00:15:22,491 --> 00:15:26,330
She fell off and it was lying flat
on the floor. And my brother, James,

240
00:15:26,331 --> 00:15:30,110
he must've been eight or nine at the time,
came running in from the school yard.

241
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,340
We lived about a block from the school,
sees her on the floor and says, mommy,

242
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:38,780
what time is it? And she
says, James, I don't know.

243
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:42,740
And he goes, okay, and runs back
out. And then later she said,

244
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:47,210
what did you think I was
doing lying on the floor? And
he said, well, I don't know,

245
00:15:47,211 --> 00:15:48,890
maybe it dusting under the piano.

246
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:55,700
So she was basically, uh, uh, she
was the old school, you know, I mean,

247
00:15:55,701 --> 00:15:59,450
she made every bit, I mean, I
kind of went back and I go, shit,

248
00:15:59,451 --> 00:16:02,420
I should've made us do more of the
work. You know, we had some chores,

249
00:16:02,421 --> 00:16:07,010
but basically she made all the beds. She,
you know, you know, it was just, you know,

250
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:11,150
it's a lot with seven kids. And again, of
course, you know, the, the, uh, you know,

251
00:16:11,151 --> 00:16:15,260
I was in the older cohorts, so there
were still, you know, young babies. Um,

252
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,210
you know, and I think, um,

253
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:21,320
the thing that's actually been been
such a great delight to me in my life,

254
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:26,180
my dad died very young, died
at 60, uh, you know, so, and,

255
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:30,370
and that's now, uh, you
know, 40 years back. Um,

256
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:35,960
and, uh, just, uh, my mom, uh, you
know, later came to travel with me.

257
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:40,490
She would just come with me on, on, uh, my
business trips. And she was just such a,

258
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,860
a willing, interested travel. She was,

259
00:16:42,861 --> 00:16:46,160
she was a girl from the back of the mail
and Yorkshire, you know, kind of grew up,

260
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:50,870
uh, you know, uh, you know, from, uh, uh,
actually, you know, the, the, the, uh,

261
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:54,410
her parents and her grandparents
before that were factory workers,

262
00:16:54,411 --> 00:16:56,440
but her dad was also a
bookie, uh, you know,

263
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:00,140
taking bets on horses back when
it was illegal. And so, uh,

264
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:04,730
she always would tell us stories,
which for her were full of shame.

265
00:17:04,731 --> 00:17:05,600
But for us,

266
00:17:05,601 --> 00:17:08,510
we're full of romance of how she used
to have to go collect Beth's from

267
00:17:08,511 --> 00:17:11,120
strangers in the park when she was
a girl and the police would come,

268
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:16,540
he'd have to light out over the
back fence is, uh, we, we, we, we,

269
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:18,950
we took great delight in
the thought that, that, uh,

270
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:22,670
we were descended from petty
criminals. I mean, again,

271
00:17:22,671 --> 00:17:26,910
of course by the time, you know, I was
a teenager and went to visit, uh, the,

272
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:30,290
it was legal and his son actually had
the bedding business and a little betting

273
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:35,090
shop. Um, but, uh, uh, it's,

274
00:17:35,091 --> 00:17:39,800
uh, it's a lot of fun and it actually
brings up something that's completely

275
00:17:39,801 --> 00:17:43,610
irrelevant, but kind of a bit of
pattern recognition. Uh, you know,

276
00:17:43,611 --> 00:17:46,260
the fact that here was a guy who,
you know,

277
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:51,240
had a living doing something that was
illegal and then when it became legalized,

278
00:17:51,241 --> 00:17:56,160
he was able to do it. And, uh, uh, it, um,

279
00:17:57,090 --> 00:18:02,020
made me think of what's
happening right now with, um, uh,

280
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:06,690
you know, with weed in, in places like
California where it's been legalized.

281
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,730
And,
um,

282
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,313
mmm,

283
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:16,180
uh, sorry, I'm trying to think of the, the
head of the San Francisco Foundation, um,

284
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:20,560
was over at dinner and,
um, you know, we're, we're,

285
00:18:20,561 --> 00:18:23,620
we're talking about various issues and,
and uh,

286
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:29,020
he says, uh, this is
Fred Blackwell. He says,

287
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,620
well, what about the weed problem? I
said, what do you mean the weed problem?

288
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:33,850
He says, well, you know,

289
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:38,290
there's all these people coming in now
and they're making all this money selling

290
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:39,124
weed.

291
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:43,750
And the only people who can't participate
in this new economy are all the black

292
00:18:43,751 --> 00:18:48,751
and brown people who have convictions
on their record for selling weed.

293
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,920
You know, and, and, you know,

294
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:55,240
it's just that kind of interesting thing
that we don't think about. You know,

295
00:18:55,241 --> 00:18:56,860
when we changed the rules,

296
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:01,540
what do we do about the people who,
you know,

297
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:04,240
played by the old rules,
the new rules.

298
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:09,400
And that just kind of leads me down the
path of a lot of what's broken and our

299
00:19:09,401 --> 00:19:12,550
society is,
you know,

300
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:16,570
this sort of layering
of ideas that change,

301
00:19:16,571 --> 00:19:21,360
but they change in completely,
uh, people have this, you know,

302
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,850
effectively bad map of the world.
It doesn't work anymore.

303
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:28,570
And uh, you know, same
kind of thing. Again,

304
00:19:28,571 --> 00:19:33,340
a lot of the work that we do at code for
America, my wife's nonprofit is around,

305
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:38,080
you know, fixing some of these things.
Yeah. We do a lot of work and a expunging,

306
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:42,190
you know, low level, you
know, uh, offenses. That's
why we were talking with Fred.

307
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,010
Um, you know, from people's record,

308
00:19:45,011 --> 00:19:48,400
they pass something called prop 47 here
in California and there was something

309
00:19:48,401 --> 00:19:52,570
like 30, $40 million spent
to pass this proposition.

310
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,980
But the implementation,
nobody thought about it.

311
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:02,020
And so a tiny fraction of the people
who are eligible have actually done it.

312
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:06,670
And the same thing we saw with
the healthcare.gov failure
back in 2013, you know,

313
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:10,840
people pass policies and
they don't actually think
about how are we going to do

314
00:20:10,841 --> 00:20:13,960
it? How are we going to actually
do this thing? You know,

315
00:20:13,961 --> 00:20:18,210
so right now if you want to clear your
record, you have to go get your, you know,

316
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:21,700
go to the DA's office and you pick up
this form and then you go somewhere else

317
00:20:21,701 --> 00:20:23,590
and get it signed by someone.
And you know,

318
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,540
these are people who don't
have the time to go, you know,

319
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:31,480
spend months on this process. You
know, if they were going to pass this,

320
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:32,711
you know,

321
00:20:32,711 --> 00:20:36,370
they could have thought through how are
we going to make this easier for people.

322
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:37,850
And a lot of the work that we do,

323
00:20:37,851 --> 00:20:42,851
the other work we do things like a
w we work on improving access to um,

324
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:46,580
you know, food aid. And
we got brought in, uh,

325
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:51,190
because they didn't really understand
why people were signing up and then

326
00:20:51,191 --> 00:20:54,430
falling off the program and then
signing up again immediately.

327
00:20:54,431 --> 00:20:58,270
And it was just administrative stuff that
people didn't know how to comply with

328
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:02,410
and they didn't have any measurement.
You know, in the tech world, you know,

329
00:21:02,411 --> 00:21:07,240
people have gotten very used to ab
testing and measuring things and

330
00:21:07,241 --> 00:21:08,920
understanding, oh, this, this is,

331
00:21:08,921 --> 00:21:10,960
this is where people are
falling out of our pipeline.

332
00:21:10,961 --> 00:21:12,310
This is where things don't work.

333
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:17,470
And a lot of what we've ended up building
at code for America are our alternate

334
00:21:17,471 --> 00:21:22,150
pathways that are designed to
teach us about what's wrong.

335
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:26,740
You know, so we're, we're, we're
sort of their exploratory, a Jen,

336
00:21:26,741 --> 00:21:29,740
my wife Jen Pahlka calls it apps to ops.
You know,

337
00:21:29,741 --> 00:21:34,741
we're basically building
apps that actually do let us
follow the users so we can

338
00:21:35,051 --> 00:21:36,430
say, Oh, you know,

339
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:40,600
here you are losing some number of
people because your application takes 45

340
00:21:40,601 --> 00:21:41,620
minutes to fill out.

341
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:46,840
And there are people who are trying to
do this in libraries where there is a 30

342
00:21:46,841 --> 00:21:51,310
minute timeout and you have no mechanism
for them to save their work. You know,

343
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:54,250
stuff like that. Or, you
know, hey, you know, uh,

344
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:58,450
you're telling people their documents are
uploaded successfully, but they're not,

345
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:01,930
you know, or you're sending
out, uh, uh, you know,

346
00:22:01,931 --> 00:22:04,650
in some counties they were
sending out, uh, you know,

347
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,780
letters about people's appointments
that they were hers to make.

348
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:10,980
And they would come in,
uh,

349
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:13,900
they would come out 25% of them
or some significant fraction.

350
00:22:13,901 --> 00:22:17,020
We come out after the date of the
appointment and they didn't know it.

351
00:22:17,021 --> 00:22:19,600
That was the worst part. Not It was
bad enough that it was happening,

352
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:24,260
but they didn't know it at the same thing.
True. You know, we, we work, uh, uh,

353
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,870
you know, a lot with at the federal
level, under Obama, uh, generous, uh,

354
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:32,890
deputy CTO and help set up something
called the United States digital service.

355
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,490
And, you know, a lot of the problems
at the Va were very similar.

356
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:40,360
People would be applying, uh,
from library computers, you know,

357
00:22:40,361 --> 00:22:44,620
homeless vets and they couldn't get
through the process. And, you know,

358
00:22:44,621 --> 00:22:48,940
basically the people in Washington w,
you know, the Va headquarters for saying,

359
00:22:48,941 --> 00:22:53,920
well, they're obviously not
eligible because they're not
succeeding. And you know,

360
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:58,840
they had tested and you know,
the, the, the, the procurement
process meant, oh yeah,

361
00:22:58,841 --> 00:23:00,040
we have to test this APP.

362
00:23:00,041 --> 00:23:03,880
But they tested it with a particular
combination of Internet explorer and Adobe

363
00:23:03,881 --> 00:23:04,714
software.

364
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:08,950
And that wasn't what was out there
in the real world and it didn't work.

365
00:23:08,951 --> 00:23:12,580
And so they went out and just film the
users and then they were able to go see,

366
00:23:12,581 --> 00:23:14,350
look,
it really doesn't work.

367
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:18,070
And in some ways that's been my life.
You know,

368
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,910
it's funny because code for is that
have a latest incarnation or one of the

369
00:23:21,911 --> 00:23:26,320
latest incarnations of that. But when
I was early in my career, you know,

370
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:30,850
it was just like, oh, this is not, you
know, doing documentation, you know,

371
00:23:30,851 --> 00:23:32,800
writing down the steps.

372
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:36,640
I still remember working with one author
on one of our early books and he said,

373
00:23:36,641 --> 00:23:41,470
I can't write this chapter yet. And I
said, that's what he said. I said, why?

374
00:23:41,471 --> 00:23:43,840
And he said, because the software
doesn't work. And I said,

375
00:23:43,841 --> 00:23:46,370
that's what you have to write because

376
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,600
you know, while you're sitting here
not getting this book done and this,

377
00:23:50,601 --> 00:23:53,300
this piece of the,
of the software that doesn't work,

378
00:23:53,301 --> 00:23:57,620
people are beating their heads against
the wall and they think it's them

379
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,840
telling them that it doesn't work is
actually the documentation that's needed

380
00:24:04,971 --> 00:24:05,690
right now.

381
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:08,010
Uh,
so I want to underscore something,

382
00:24:08,011 --> 00:24:13,011
see this question of how can we make
x easier for people or why isn't,

383
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:18,240
why easier for people? And I do want
to rewind just a little bit because I,

384
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:23,640
and many people are very interested in
how you think and how that leads to,

385
00:24:23,641 --> 00:24:26,040
for instance, identifying edges. I mean,

386
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:29,040
you've been a great pioneer on the
edge of many different frontiers.

387
00:24:29,041 --> 00:24:34,041
So I want to go back to
not necessarily the bookie,

388
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:38,190
but to,
to ask what,

389
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,760
well, first of all, this
is just personal curiosity.

390
00:24:41,761 --> 00:24:46,761
What do your other siblings do these
days as professions or any examples?

391
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:52,520
Well, let me kind of
go through my, um, uh,

392
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,880
my oldest brother,
uh,

393
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:57,840
has had a pastiche of careers.

394
00:24:57,841 --> 00:25:02,840
He owns a small fleet of taxi cabs where
he's been competing with, uh, with, uh,

395
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:05,580
with, uh, Uber and Lyft
and, and, you know,

396
00:25:05,581 --> 00:25:08,550
kind of fulminating against
the taxi system. He, you know,

397
00:25:08,551 --> 00:25:13,200
he would like to be able to operate like
Uber and Lyft and can't, you know, and,

398
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:16,590
and, uh, um, uh, he also runs a,

399
00:25:16,591 --> 00:25:20,430
a a business reselling used books,
including mine on Amazon.

400
00:25:20,431 --> 00:25:24,230
So he's kind of in these, and
unfortunately he's dealing
with two very, uh, uh,

401
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:29,130
declining industries. Uh, and, uh, he, um,

402
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:32,400
uh, uh, my,

403
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:37,430
my next brother as run a small publishing
company that I started with him called

404
00:25:38,101 --> 00:25:39,030
travelers tales,

405
00:25:39,031 --> 00:25:44,031
which a row basically was a
story based approach to travel,

406
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,860
you know, rather than guide books,
which tell you, uh, in a what to do.

407
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:53,010
It was like more like people sharing
their experiences so you can go, oh, yeah,

408
00:25:53,011 --> 00:25:57,180
that sounds like exactly what I want
as opposed to kind of like the catalog

409
00:25:57,181 --> 00:26:02,010
approach. And, uh, uh, so he's big,
been a travel writer for many years.

410
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:06,660
And then, uh, my, uh, all of my sisters,

411
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:11,430
uh, have basically, uh, just,
uh, have raised families. Uh,

412
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:15,020
although it's interesting, a very
heavy percentage of homeschooling in,

413
00:26:15,021 --> 00:26:19,990
in my family. And, uh, so that's,
so they've been teachers as well as,

414
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:23,940
as a, uh, as parents. My younger brother,

415
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:28,650
frank is a builder, a in ecology,
be basically built, um, uh,

416
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:33,120
uh, a house to live in and a, and never
looked back. You know, it was like,

417
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:36,290
they went, I think it was a junior, he
had a friend built the house that they,

418
00:26:36,291 --> 00:26:38,400
they went and lived in and then
they weren't, this was great.

419
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:42,420
So they rented it to some other
students, uh, the, uh, uh,

420
00:26:42,421 --> 00:26:44,040
and then built one over the summer

421
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,400
and lived in that and then, you
know, anyway, so he started, uh,

422
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:49,770
and it's kind of funny because
he's really built the hope.

423
00:26:49,771 --> 00:26:53,070
He still lives near the college he lived
in and he's built, you know, the church,

424
00:26:53,071 --> 00:26:56,290
the school, the library,
you know, the, uh,

425
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:59,340
the home is that many of the people
live in. And he now has a, you know,

426
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:02,880
kind of a business that's
a rental businesses,

427
00:27:02,881 --> 00:27:07,410
some actually fabulous places he's built
on the Shenandoah river that, uh, uh,

428
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,700
he ran since kind of interesting because
he's actually been a lot like me and

429
00:27:10,701 --> 00:27:15,701
that he built his business
just intuitively from the
ground up by following his

430
00:27:16,621 --> 00:27:20,220
nose. And what was so interesting
though, when we were growing up,

431
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,890
if you had asked my mom,

432
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:26,250
she would have said that frank
and I were the most dissimilar.

433
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:30,660
Why is that? Well, because, you know,

434
00:27:30,661 --> 00:27:34,890
I was always the top student
in school and he was, you know,

435
00:27:34,891 --> 00:27:37,110
he got D's And F's and you know,

436
00:27:37,111 --> 00:27:39,450
and we were with my brothers
and I were always say, no, no,

437
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:42,870
he just isn't interested in it because
we would see him at home. You know,

438
00:27:42,871 --> 00:27:44,000
when he was 10 years old,
he,

439
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:48,460
he got totally obsessed with the civil
war and he'd read it was reading Bruce

440
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:51,360
Cat and then all the history, you know, he
did a lot, lots and lots of history and,

441
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,470
you know,
and,

442
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:55,830
and setting up these enormous
recreation's of battles of the civil war.

443
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:00,780
And we were, he's just not
interested in school. And, uh,

444
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,580
you know, I, and, and so, you
know, just sort of interesting
watching. He's, you know,

445
00:28:05,581 --> 00:28:08,310
he's, he's, uh, seven
years younger than I am,

446
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:12,630
but watching him kind of have the same
path of building his own business, uh,

447
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:17,400
you know, creating a lot of value
for the people around him, uh,

448
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:22,740
uh, and, and, and pivoting as necessary.
You know, he, he got into the, the, uh,

449
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:25,720
even though he started with this sort
of rental thing in college to be,

450
00:28:25,721 --> 00:28:29,100
it was basically building
and selling homes. Uh,

451
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:32,490
and then after the 2008 financial crisis,

452
00:28:32,491 --> 00:28:37,170
nobody would finance, uh, you
know, homes unless you had cash.

453
00:28:37,171 --> 00:28:40,980
So he basically, but you could borrow
for a business property. So he ended up,

454
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,270
you know,
building,

455
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:45,810
he had these lots and started building
places then renting them and he actually

456
00:28:45,811 --> 00:28:50,110
got pretty good at it. So he, he,
uh, you know, he is a variety of,

457
00:28:50,111 --> 00:28:52,880
of businesses and a [inaudible].

458
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:53,910
What,

459
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:58,910
what advice would you give to a
parent who has a kid currently,

460
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:01,980
like your brother who's clearly very,

461
00:29:01,981 --> 00:29:06,690
very bright but just doesn't seem to be
interested in school and therefore is

462
00:29:06,691 --> 00:29:09,060
getting poor grades?
What would you,

463
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:11,610
what would you say to someone
like that parent in that position?

464
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:12,881
It's a,
it's a,

465
00:29:12,881 --> 00:29:17,230
it's sort of a tough one because
sometimes you do have to push kids.

466
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:20,770
I think the main thing,
and this is true,

467
00:29:20,771 --> 00:29:25,240
whether you're a parent with your
kids or whether you're, uh, you know,

468
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:30,270
a business person or just somebody trying
to solve problems in your own life is

469
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:36,450
having an attitude of receptivity and
openness and looking really looking and

470
00:29:37,871 --> 00:29:42,800
understanding what's going on. I mean,
you know, at the end of the day, uh,

471
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:48,100
there are no recipes and
so many problems come from,

472
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:48,850
you know,

473
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:53,410
people following recipes or following
maps that don't match the reality.

474
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,730
And you know, like frank didn't
match the, the, you know,

475
00:29:57,731 --> 00:30:01,060
the recipe of what you were supposed to
do in school, but it was pretty clear.

476
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:06,310
He w he was following his own path.
Same thing's true, uh, of, uh,

477
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:10,930
you know, I have two daughters
and one of them school was easy.

478
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:13,480
She always did well. The other
one, you know, not so well,

479
00:30:13,481 --> 00:30:16,420
but she was like totally
following her own path.

480
00:30:16,421 --> 00:30:19,130
And she's become this
amazing sound artists,

481
00:30:19,131 --> 00:30:22,930
these artists and residents
of the exploratorium, uh, you
know, created a, you know,

482
00:30:22,931 --> 00:30:24,490
uh, uh, you know,

483
00:30:24,491 --> 00:30:28,150
an iPhone app for something called
rhythm necklace is this different way of

484
00:30:28,151 --> 00:30:32,640
visualizing, know rhythm. Uh, she's
sort of exploring medieval hocket and,

485
00:30:32,641 --> 00:30:36,750
and she's, you know, scored stuff for, uh,
you know, Bjorks biophilia tour and, uh,

486
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:38,230
you know, created a, you know,

487
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:41,350
the sort of all these sort
of odd musical instruments.

488
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:46,500
Just totally built her own curiosity
driven pass into the world.

489
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:51,080
And, and uh, you know, so the, the,

490
00:30:51,081 --> 00:30:55,900
the thing I guess I would just say
is like, look at your kid. You know,

491
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:59,790
there's a wonderful book, I
forget the name of the author. Um,

492
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:04,990
it's called loving every child.
Uh, and it's about a guy,

493
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,820
uh, in Nazi Germany. Uh, he,

494
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:12,580
he basically had two
schools and, um, one was,

495
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:17,170
you know, for, uh, children of,
you know, so wealthy, you know,

496
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:21,790
Germans, uh, you know, and then the
other was a segregated school for Jews.

497
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:25,300
And when they came to
take his Jewish kids,

498
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:30,040
he went with them and died in
the concentration camp. And,

499
00:31:30,041 --> 00:31:33,370
uh, sorry, um,

500
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,770
uh,
funny how we can forget those things.

501
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:45,570
Uh, but anyway, but it does, the
point of the book is, is, you know,

502
00:31:45,571 --> 00:31:49,230
if I love your children, look
at them, understand them,

503
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:54,720
and listen to them. And, and,
uh, the thing that I think,

504
00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:00,300
you know, the, you know,
treat them as people. I mean,

505
00:32:00,301 --> 00:32:03,870
a lot of people treat their
kids as objects. You know,

506
00:32:03,871 --> 00:32:06,390
I've been in a room with people where
they talk about their kids when they're

507
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:10,890
there, as if they don't, you know, they
don't listen. They're not there, you know,

508
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:16,080
or they just, um, you know, as
the kids are on show or they're,

509
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:20,370
uh, you know, told what to
do and, and yeah. You know,

510
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:24,430
it's like treat them like you
would want to be treated. You know,

511
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:28,230
I guess I felt like I did my
best, you know, as a parent,

512
00:32:28,231 --> 00:32:30,600
parenting is a hard job,
you know,

513
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,020
to just be there with
your kids and, and, uh,

514
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:38,130
talk with them and listen to them.
What,

515
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:39,980
are there any questions that you'd like

516
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,480
to ask your kids a lot.
Are there any uh,

517
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,810
or questions that you've
taught them to ask themselves?

518
00:32:44,811 --> 00:32:46,580
This might seem like a non sequitur,
but

519
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,660
it's what came to mind for me.

520
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:57,650
So good. I, you know, uh, I, I wish I
had an easy answer to it and I don't,

521
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:58,873
um,

522
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,600
that's okay. I don't have kids. I
don't have any answers to it. Yeah.

523
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:07,740
Well, the one thing that I, I, this
is not a question, but that, you know,

524
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:12,770
there's one piece of life advice
that I give in the form of a quote.

525
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,490
It's almost like a psychiatrist named
urban yellow, who is also a novelist.

526
00:33:20,491 --> 00:33:24,990
And he wrote a novel called when
nature wept, uh, which is, uh,

527
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,100
an imagined, um, uh,

528
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,890
the story of early psychoanalyst,
a analysis. Actually Pre Freud,

529
00:33:31,891 --> 00:33:35,190
there was a guy who was a predecessor to
Freud and it's, it's basically him, uh,

530
00:33:35,191 --> 00:33:36,300
analyzing nature.

531
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:41,550
There's this one line in it that really
stuck in my head as lions do sometimes

532
00:33:41,551 --> 00:33:45,570
from books. And it was, um, uh,

533
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:50,310
first we'll what is necessary
and then log what you will.

534
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,160
And you know,
it,

535
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:57,720
it does have to do with the one thing
that I think we do have to teach our

536
00:33:57,721 --> 00:34:00,270
children. Oh Wow. There's a lot of
things we have to teach our children.

537
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:05,010
But one of them is that
everything doesn't come easily.

538
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,740
And there are some things that you
have to do that you don't want to do.

539
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:15,730
And one of the secrets of
success in life is to first,

540
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,890
you know, we'll those things
and then come to love them.

541
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:23,150
And you think about that with exercise,
the great example, you know what I mean?

542
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,480
Once you know, it's like,
it's, it's hard to get started,

543
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:29,450
but once you get in into it,

544
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:34,090
it becomes a joy. And, uh,

545
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:37,010
there are a lot of things that are
like that, you know, doing the dishes,

546
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:40,610
cleaning the house, uh, you know,

547
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:44,930
looking after other people and,
and so,

548
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,233
you know,

549
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,560
sort of understanding how
having an understanding of,

550
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:56,650
of what your responsibilities are and
then working at them if necessary with

551
00:34:57,591 --> 00:35:02,060
will until they become something that
you love is just an incredibly useful

552
00:35:02,061 --> 00:35:04,100
piece of life advice.

553
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:10,220
So I'm definitely going to want to
come back and talk about what you've,

554
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:13,880
what you have personally found
difficult or difficult moments,

555
00:35:13,881 --> 00:35:18,770
but I want to ask about
a decision that you made.

556
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:22,730
And this is transitioning
from a classics degree,

557
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:27,850
uh, to writing technical manuals, uh,

558
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:31,340
for lack of a better descriptor. You
could certainly give some more context,

559
00:35:31,341 --> 00:35:36,341
but how did that happen
and why did you decide to

560
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:42,320
trend in that direction? Well, it, it,
it was pretty simple. First of all,

561
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:46,230
let me give a little context
for the classics. Um,

562
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:51,600
I had worked in the early seventies
when I was actually just even a teenager

563
00:35:51,601 --> 00:35:54,740
with a guy named George Simon who,
uh,

564
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:00,680
had developed this theory about the
evolution of consciousness and also about,

565
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:07,380
uh, sort of a, a sort of an
experiential approach to, um,

566
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,860
you know, kind of inner
spiritual growth. You know,

567
00:36:10,861 --> 00:36:15,570
I could kind of go into it in
more detail, um, but let me just,

568
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:20,310
and, but one of his ideas was that the
had been this profound evolution of

569
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:22,980
consciousness over time.
Uh,

570
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,520
and then there was a sort of a historical
art to it and that we were in a period

571
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:31,580
of a sort of individuation that had
really begun in classical Greece.

572
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:36,410
Um, and yeah, you know, there are
actually books like grittiness, Nell's,

573
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:39,240
the discovery of the mind where
you can kind of see this, you know,

574
00:36:39,241 --> 00:36:42,810
that when they talk about,
you know, in home or, uh,

575
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,660
you know, uh, [inaudible], uh,
doesn't decide to do something.

576
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:53,100
You know, Athena puts this idea
into his two mosques, his liver,

577
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:59,280
and he acts. And then by the time,
you know, 400 years later, you know,

578
00:36:59,281 --> 00:37:01,710
you know,
when you're reading about Socrates,

579
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:06,240
you're seeing them wrestling with these
ideas that really are at the heart of,

580
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:11,190
you know, what is truth? What is justice?
What is, you know, uh, you know, uh,

581
00:37:11,191 --> 00:37:13,950
what is happiness? And, uh,

582
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:19,320
but that was sort of the subject of my
thesis in classics was really about,

583
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:22,840
uh, it was about mysticism
and logic and in Plato of,

584
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:26,280
because they would kind of talk about,
well, you know, these mystical passages,

585
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:28,950
he must've been influenced by the
orthotics. And I'm like, no, you know,

586
00:37:28,951 --> 00:37:33,300
these things that we now kind of
rehearse, you know, like ideas of justice.

587
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:38,090
They were incredibly new and powerful
and yes, they felt like, uh, you know,

588
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:42,120
these mystical kind of things that
they were wrestling with. And, and, uh,

589
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:43,800
but anyway, but I digress. But,

590
00:37:43,801 --> 00:37:47,310
so the point of the reason
I was interested in classics
was deeply connected

591
00:37:47,311 --> 00:37:51,680
with George's theory because I was into
like, okay, we're now entering into,

592
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:55,380
he had this idea that we were
entering into this new phase of global

593
00:37:55,381 --> 00:37:59,490
consciousness. And as a real irony,
because my long detour into tech,

594
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,280
uh, was, uh,

595
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:05,790
it turned out not to be a detour at all
because who would have thought that,

596
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:10,290
you know, uh, you know, I'm trying to
think how much longer, 30 years later,

597
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:14,920
I would be kind of the profit of global
consciousness in the form of web today

598
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:20,790
and mediated by technology. But to
answer your question very specifically,

599
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:25,620
uh, it was, you know, uh, my,

600
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:30,150
my wife and I have been talking about
having kids. She was saying, you know,

601
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:34,590
I have about six, she was seven
years old and I, I wasn't,

602
00:38:34,591 --> 00:38:36,220
she was ready before I was

603
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:41,260
and I was 24 and I basically
said, you know, one day I said,

604
00:38:41,261 --> 00:38:44,710
I'm ready. You know, she had
been saying what some kids,
and I said, okay, I'm ready.

605
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:49,700
And, and the very next day, uh,
I still remember it, you know,

606
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:53,920
these three things happen on the same
day and it was almost like a sign.

607
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:57,670
One of them. Uh, well I guess the, the,

608
00:38:57,671 --> 00:39:02,170
the main thing I would just say is
once I decided it was sort of like, oh,

609
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:05,830
I have to start really being the
breadwinner, I have to be a provider.

610
00:39:05,831 --> 00:39:10,460
And it was sort of like a, a light gun,
you know, switch got flicked, you know,

611
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:15,410
it was like, wow, daddy juice kicked
in. And uh, you know, I had been,

612
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:19,150
uh, so I, uh, the,

613
00:39:19,151 --> 00:39:23,110
the three things that happen the day
of that decision or the day after that

614
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:27,100
decision, one, it was, it was not
really meaningful other than, uh,

615
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:29,500
just a psychological boost.
Uh,

616
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:35,030
I had a friend who was dating the
Philippine ambassador to the UN and he was

617
00:39:36,341 --> 00:39:40,720
trying to remember a quote from loud and
she knew that I was really deeply into

618
00:39:40,721 --> 00:39:44,860
Lao Tzu. And uh, so yeah,
she called me up to say, Hey,

619
00:39:44,861 --> 00:39:47,980
my aunt and my friend needs this quote
free speech. He's going to give it to you,

620
00:39:47,981 --> 00:39:50,770
ed. You could, you could, you know, it
was, and it was just kind of cool air.

621
00:39:50,771 --> 00:39:53,230
I am as you know,
this kid being asked

622
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:59,080
as a source for this speech that gave
me a boost. The other thing was, uh,

623
00:39:59,081 --> 00:40:04,081
I got approached by another friend
to write a book about Frank Herbert,

624
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:04,811
which is the scent.

625
00:40:04,811 --> 00:40:08,960
And the thing that ended up convincing
me that I was a writer. And then, uh,

626
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:13,270
the third thing was I had this friend
who was a programmer who got asked to

627
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:16,780
write a manual and I
said I would help him.

628
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:20,950
And so in some ways it was a,
you know,

629
00:40:20,951 --> 00:40:24,820
like I made the decision
and then magically, uh, the,

630
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:28,340
all the pieces arrived on the table,
you know,

631
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:30,700
for me to start assembling
the puzzle of my life

632
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:37,210
or I need perhaps you also, I just
had the selective attention. Yeah.

633
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:38,780
To spot those things.

634
00:40:38,781 --> 00:40:41,540
I've had a couple of questions
I don't want to gloss over this.

635
00:40:41,541 --> 00:40:44,620
One day I woke up and I
said, I am ready. Yeah.

636
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:46,550
What triggered that?

637
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:50,120
It was there a conversation you had in
your head over that cup of coffee that

638
00:40:50,121 --> 00:40:52,450
morning?
Was there a realization what,

639
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:57,140
what actually led you to
proclaim that you are ready?

640
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:02,480
Let me kind of go back to George Simon
because a lot of what he taught was a

641
00:41:03,001 --> 00:41:06,060
kind of a,
a kind of mental discipline.

642
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:10,290
And that was rooted in a model
of how consciousness happens.

643
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:16,050
And it was, uh, it was sort of
framed somewhat in the language of,

644
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:20,310
of uh, Alfred Korzybski
is general semantics. Uh,

645
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:24,270
cause he had this wonderful
diagram that he drew.

646
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:26,580
It was actually a tool that
he used to train people.

647
00:41:26,581 --> 00:41:28,110
He called the structural differential.

648
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:33,770
And of course Lipsky's fundamental
idea was that people are

649
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:38,030
stuck in language,
but language is about something.

650
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:43,900
And so he represented the process of
what he called the process of abstraction

651
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:47,660
so that people could kind of ask
themselves, where are you in that process?

652
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:52,910
And so the structural differential
ha, the first part was a parabola. Uh,

653
00:41:52,911 --> 00:41:53,181
you know,

654
00:41:53,181 --> 00:41:57,440
and the idea was the reason why it's a
parabola is because reality is infinite,

655
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,350
but we can't take in all of reality.

656
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:04,760
And so hanging from the
parabola was a circle.

657
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,910
And the circle was our experience,

658
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:11,810
which is our first
abstraction from reality.

659
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:16,530
And then hanging from the
circle are a bunch of, you know,

660
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:20,030
a label shaped tags,
like multiple strings of them.

661
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:24,530
And these are the words that we
use to describe our experience.

662
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:29,360
And Chris Sinski's training was for
people to recognize when they were in the

663
00:42:29,361 --> 00:42:33,080
words, when they were in the experience,
when they were open to the reality.

664
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:38,560
And George kind of mix
that in with, uh, this, uh,

665
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:42,220
work of, of, uh, Sri Aurobindo
who was, uh, you know, uh,

666
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:46,600
Indian sage and kind of had come up
with a model that kind of an integrated,

667
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:50,810
kind of a spiritual view of this m
and a practice, which was a kind of,

668
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:55,250
of just listening, you know,
being open to the unknown.

669
00:42:56,770 --> 00:43:01,610
Is that an active, is that,
yes, it's a tactic thing. You
know, you, you, you, you know,

670
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:06,160
it's just like, uh, you can
see when somebody is doing it,

671
00:43:06,161 --> 00:43:09,040
but it's just like letting go,
letting things come in.

672
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:10,400
Yeah.

673
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,130
And then actually letting,
if you do it correctly,

674
00:43:13,131 --> 00:43:18,131
what starts to happen is you start feeling
things and you don't really know what

675
00:43:18,291 --> 00:43:20,610
they are. They don't match. You
know, it's not like, you know, you,

676
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:22,910
you put your hand on a table
and you feel the table,

677
00:43:22,911 --> 00:43:27,911
but there's kind of a spiritual energy
that you feel and you sit with it and

678
00:43:27,921 --> 00:43:29,790
eventually ideas for him.

679
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:33,110
You'll see this actual process
that was described by the, the,

680
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:37,190
the structural differential you can
actually use as a spiritual practice and

681
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,310
you're wrestling with a problem.
Like, am I ready to have kids?

682
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:45,140
You're not sitting there down
in the labels saying, you know,

683
00:43:45,141 --> 00:43:47,960
pros and cons, you know, there
are people who do that, right?

684
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,610
But using this approach,
you simply say,

685
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:55,530
you know, uh, you know,

686
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:00,880
let me pose this as a problem to this
infinite universe and let me sit in an

687
00:44:01,251 --> 00:44:04,820
attitude of receptivity and
listen to one answer counts.

688
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:09,070
And I think this is what a lot of
people mean by prayer. Uh, but,

689
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:14,080
but it's really interesting to put it in
the context of perception because this

690
00:44:15,081 --> 00:44:19,820
same process happens in the
real world. You know, it, it
is what happens. You know,

691
00:44:19,821 --> 00:44:22,940
there's these things outside you
and you don't really look at them

692
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:29,020
and no, you don't take them in and then,
you know, but so there's sort of this,

693
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:32,490
so basically the answer is I kind of said,
am I ready?

694
00:44:32,491 --> 00:44:35,260
I just had this attitude
of openness and this,

695
00:44:35,261 --> 00:44:37,500
this internal process that goes on.

696
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:43,130
And then one day it just crystallizes
and the label that hangs off that moment,

697
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:48,000
the first label is, I'm ready, you know?

698
00:44:48,001 --> 00:44:50,850
And then the next label is,
uh, you know, here are these,

699
00:44:50,851 --> 00:44:52,420
these things that I'm going to do.
Yeah.

700
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,060
So I am fascinated by this. The,
did you pose the question then?

701
00:44:57,061 --> 00:45:00,810
I have a number of
friends, uh, Josh Waitzkin,

702
00:45:00,811 --> 00:45:05,811
who's best known as the inspiration for
the book and the movie searching for

703
00:45:06,451 --> 00:45:10,140
Bobby Fischer,
who's thought of as a chess prodigy.

704
00:45:10,141 --> 00:45:11,430
But there's a lot more than that.

705
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:16,410
Reid Hoffman also as a similar approach
to journaling where they will pose a

706
00:45:16,411 --> 00:45:17,670
question to themselves,

707
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:22,730
the day or the night prior to when
they journal in the morning for you.

708
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:28,110
Did you pose this question
at a particular time when,

709
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:31,950
uh, and you know, maybe
there are, is this,

710
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:34,740
is this something that you
have used in other places?

711
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:40,060
Oh, absolutely. I mean, you know, for me,
I mean at that particular time, you know,

712
00:45:40,061 --> 00:45:44,980
when I was younger and closer to that as,
you know, a big part of my daily work,

713
00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:48,490
uh, I think it was just sort
of a natural outflow. I mean,

714
00:45:48,491 --> 00:45:52,330
at the time what I was doing for a living
was actually teaching these techniques.

715
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:57,250
So it was sort of, you know, I
lived and breathed this stuff. Um,

716
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:59,080
and, but, but it's, it's,

717
00:45:59,170 --> 00:46:02,620
it's continued to be
this key part of my life.

718
00:46:02,621 --> 00:46:04,910
Whenever I'm confronted with a problem,
you know,

719
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:09,580
you find yourself wrestling and you go,
oh wait, I'm just rearranging the labels.

720
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:11,700
Could you give me a useful,

721
00:46:11,701 --> 00:46:15,600
could you give me a real world
example from your life? Um,

722
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:18,130
or a hypothetical? Uh, but yeah.

723
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:21,190
Well let me, let me give
you a very, you know, um,

724
00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:26,680
a specific business example. It's not
quite the same in the end that it wasn't,

725
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:30,280
um, you know, kind of
this explicitly enter

726
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:35,200
process, but it was certainly
an outgrowth. Oh, it actually,

727
00:46:35,201 --> 00:46:39,920
it wasn't an or process. I
take it back. Uh, so I had,

728
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:45,520
and this is my sort of my contribution
to the evolution of the open source

729
00:46:45,521 --> 00:46:46,354
movement.

730
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:52,020
So I was sitting there and I had been
part of this Unix community and this

731
00:46:55,060 --> 00:47:00,060
Internet community and I noticed
something and what I noticed was that the

732
00:47:00,431 --> 00:47:03,790
people, for the most part, the
people that I knew from Unix,

733
00:47:04,090 --> 00:47:06,910
which is really represented by people
who are around this community of this

734
00:47:06,911 --> 00:47:08,110
conference called use next.

735
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:12,040
And then the people from the Internet
who were kind of would meet over the IATF

736
00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:16,510
with relatively few exceptions,
didn't overlap. Right.

737
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:19,780
And then they did overlap with my life
because I was publishing books about,

738
00:47:19,930 --> 00:47:22,750
you know, both work coming out
of both of these communities.

739
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:27,190
And I thought,
I want to bring them together,

740
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:30,010
but something was

741
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:34,420
stopping me. You know, like
I had this idea, I wanted to,

742
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:38,500
uh, you know, get people
from the community.

743
00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:42,670
And I started thinking about it and I
kept delaying and delaying and delaying

744
00:47:42,671 --> 00:47:45,480
and it was like there was something,
um,

745
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:47,770
that was not letting me do it.

746
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:52,560
And then one, you know, and I was,

747
00:47:52,590 --> 00:47:56,400
I was at one and then Netscape
announced that they were going to,

748
00:47:56,460 --> 00:48:01,350
to release, uh, what later
became Mozilla as free software.

749
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:06,030
I went, Damn, I'm too late. You know,
I've, I've done this, I should, you know,

750
00:48:06,031 --> 00:48:09,870
kind of moved on this sooner. It's now
starting to become a story about it,

751
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:13,770
a free software and why it's
important. And, and, uh,

752
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:15,470
and,

753
00:48:15,470 --> 00:48:19,290
and then I got kicked me into gear and I
organize this event that I first called

754
00:48:19,291 --> 00:48:20,220
the free,
where summit,

755
00:48:20,221 --> 00:48:22,590
where I invited in people from all
of these different communities.

756
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:27,690
And it was at that meeting that, uh,
Eric Raymond said, well, you know,

757
00:48:27,691 --> 00:48:31,500
we were meeting a couple of weeks ago
and Christine Peterson came up with this

758
00:48:31,501 --> 00:48:35,300
new name open source software because
you know, free software has these,

759
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:38,850
these problems, uh, you
know, as, as a, as a name.

760
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:43,950
And we voted on it and they all agreed
to use, you know, free software has,

761
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:47,230
uh, that, yeah, I mean, open source
software as this name. And we,

762
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:50,280
I had organized a press conference at
the end of the day even though I didn't

763
00:48:50,281 --> 00:48:52,920
know what the outcome was going
to be and we kind of, you know,

764
00:48:52,921 --> 00:48:55,410
I put people up on this stage and said,
look at all these guys,

765
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:59,220
they all have dominant market share in
these interesting categories of software

766
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:02,460
and they all have this thing in common.
They give their software away for free.

767
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:06,270
Uh, you know, and we've come together
and we've decided on a new name for it.

768
00:49:06,271 --> 00:49:07,530
We're calling it open source software.

769
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:11,460
And the thing that was sort of interesting
about that was first of all, yes,

770
00:49:11,461 --> 00:49:15,330
I noticed that something was
wrong in the map of the world.

771
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:19,830
You know, that basically people who
were talking about free software,

772
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:24,480
we're only talking about Linux and it was
his whole other world of free software

773
00:49:24,481 --> 00:49:29,040
over on the Internet side that was
left out because the dialogue was,

774
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:33,840
you know, about, you know, the battle
against Microsoft and the PC and so on.

775
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:39,150
And so I just kind of, you know, so I
was just sitting with it, you know, and,

776
00:49:39,210 --> 00:49:39,540
and,

777
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:44,540
and trying to think about what to do
and that sitting and the attitude of

778
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:48,810
receptivity, it was something very similar
that kind of happened in some sense.

779
00:49:48,811 --> 00:49:50,640
One day, you know, this thing happened.

780
00:49:50,641 --> 00:49:54,240
It was I something that uses the analogy
of you're doing a puzzle and you can't

781
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:58,500
solve it. And then somebody
dumps new pieces on the
table, right? And then you go,

782
00:49:58,501 --> 00:50:01,440
oh, there that one go, it fits right in.
And that's exactly what happened there.

783
00:50:01,770 --> 00:50:02,850
But that waiting,

784
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:07,470
that waiting is this psych part of
the psychological process. You know,

785
00:50:07,471 --> 00:50:11,160
like if you're sort of simple, if you kind
of have this engineering mindset, well,

786
00:50:11,161 --> 00:50:15,210
we're just going to go and work with
all the pieces that we have, you know,

787
00:50:15,211 --> 00:50:18,030
you may not get to the right
answer. And, and, and so this,

788
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:21,570
this receptivity to the unknown,
you know,

789
00:50:21,571 --> 00:50:24,540
and I actually often think of
soccer thieves in this regard.

790
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:27,770
He referred to something, he
called these diamonds, you know,

791
00:50:27,771 --> 00:50:31,310
just like listening to this inner
voice that would tell him yes or no.

792
00:50:31,311 --> 00:50:35,240
And I also think there's this great
line that recurs a continually,

793
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:38,040
and my favorite translation and loud Su,
uh,

794
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:42,410
the way of life according to law suit
by Winter Benner and as the line is,

795
00:50:42,411 --> 00:50:44,660
he has his no,
and he has his yes.

796
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:50,090
And listening to that no. And
that, yes. So, uh, you know,

797
00:50:50,091 --> 00:50:53,360
I had this know about,
I'm not ready to have a child.

798
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:57,860
And then one day I had a yes,
and I had this,

799
00:50:57,861 --> 00:51:01,160
no, I'm not ready to bring
all these people together.

800
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:07,280
And then I had a yes.
And the fact that that there's this,

801
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:08,781
yeah,

802
00:51:08,781 --> 00:51:13,781
like I had no way of knowing that
this new term had been introduced,

803
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:17,180
but if I had had my
meeting a month earlier,

804
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:23,090
the term open source software would not
have been there to be picked up at my

805
00:51:23,091 --> 00:51:23,890
meeting.

806
00:51:23,890 --> 00:51:24,723
Hmm.

807
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:29,120
You know, and you, you can't, you can't
miss a mystery. Why is it that, you know,

808
00:51:29,121 --> 00:51:30,500
like,
I didn't know that,

809
00:51:30,501 --> 00:51:33,740
but some things stopped me and
I was kind of kicking myself,

810
00:51:34,670 --> 00:51:38,300
but like listening to that inner
voice that just said, oh, I'm not,

811
00:51:38,301 --> 00:51:40,010
and then one day it's like,
yes,

812
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:44,630
know he has his note and then he
has his yes. Or she has her. Yes.

813
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:48,590
So I, I think that you, and I might,
I don't know if you drink alcohol,

814
00:51:48,591 --> 00:51:49,161
but if you do,

815
00:51:49,161 --> 00:51:52,490
then maybe this is more of a
conversation for several bottles of wine.

816
00:51:52,491 --> 00:51:55,730
But I do love what I'm about to bring up.

817
00:51:55,731 --> 00:51:58,040
So you mentioned a deceased,

818
00:51:58,041 --> 00:52:02,540
Aka Ulysses and the sort of, uh, uh,

819
00:52:02,541 --> 00:52:05,690
God planting an idea or
desire in his liver. Right.

820
00:52:05,691 --> 00:52:08,870
And then you have a flash forward to,

821
00:52:08,871 --> 00:52:13,871
I think you had mentioned Plato and
grappling with this concept of justice and

822
00:52:14,571 --> 00:52:18,380
then you know, what seemed to
mystical now being part of the norm.

823
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:23,770
Is our consciousness evolving or uh,

824
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:27,380
looking back at the framework that you
were discussing with the parabola then

825
00:52:27,381 --> 00:52:28,460
abstraction.

826
00:52:28,490 --> 00:52:32,150
So we have reality than it abstraction
of experience and a further abstraction

827
00:52:32,151 --> 00:52:32,984
of language.

828
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:38,060
Are we just getting further from
reality or are they the same thing?

829
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:41,450
Evolving consciousness and getting
further from that direct experience of

830
00:52:41,510 --> 00:52:42,850
greater reality?
Well,

831
00:52:46,150 --> 00:52:49,540
you know, I think it's different.
I mean, when you say we,

832
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:53,310
if you mean all of humanity,
I think we're all uh,

833
00:52:53,410 --> 00:52:55,600
know rediscovering,
you know,

834
00:52:55,630 --> 00:53:00,510
that process in our
lives. You know, um, I,

835
00:53:00,730 --> 00:53:05,640
I think, uh, societies can
get further or closer, uh,

836
00:53:06,010 --> 00:53:07,930
individuals can get further or closer,

837
00:53:08,170 --> 00:53:13,170
but I think as a whole we have in fact
taken in more and more of that parabola.

838
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:22,770
You know, the, the, the circle has
gotten bigger and the, the, the,

839
00:53:22,771 --> 00:53:27,750
the useful, you know, labels have gotten
bigger. Also, many of them have gotten,

840
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:31,800
you know, things would get
mislabeled. But I, you know,

841
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:35,970
if you think I, and this was sort of
another piece of what I learned from,

842
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,200
from George Simon, and it really
was this idea that that is our work.

843
00:53:40,290 --> 00:53:45,290
Our work is to take in more of the unknown
and to bring it into our experience

844
00:53:47,461 --> 00:53:51,190
and to bring it into our knowledge.
And there's always more, you know,

845
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:55,830
George used to have this
great formulation, he
referred to God as et Cetera,

846
00:53:56,710 --> 00:53:57,543
all the rest.

847
00:54:00,970 --> 00:54:01,803
I love it.

848
00:54:01,850 --> 00:54:04,850
Yeah. And I love that it, you know,
and it's just sort of, for me, it's,

849
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:09,230
it's a useful,
not just mental construct,

850
00:54:09,231 --> 00:54:13,010
but psychological construct, you know, and
it comes up for me, you know, the way I,

851
00:54:13,011 --> 00:54:16,580
the way I, you know, when I have an idea
like this, I just see it everywhere.

852
00:54:16,581 --> 00:54:20,170
You know, it used to be this, I mean,
it still is, I think this, this, um,

853
00:54:20,270 --> 00:54:24,170
mock Tarot deck called Morgan's
Taro. I've never seen, it was just,

854
00:54:24,430 --> 00:54:27,260
it was popular in the 70s. I don't
know if it's still available anywhere,

855
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:30,680
but it had these, these,
uh, fabulous cards.

856
00:54:30,681 --> 00:54:33,680
And my favorite card was always the one,

857
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:37,820
it was basically a blank card with
the caption. Always remember this,

858
00:54:40,070 --> 00:54:42,050
always remember,
you know,

859
00:54:42,110 --> 00:54:46,130
and it was just that moment of
just listening to the silence.

860
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:51,440
And, um, you know, when you have that
ability to listen to the silence,

861
00:54:51,441 --> 00:54:55,310
you also have the
ability to, uh, you know,

862
00:54:55,311 --> 00:55:00,230
take things in a different way
and see the world fresh. So,

863
00:55:00,231 --> 00:55:03,290
so that I think about Morgan's
through. But I also think about, uh,

864
00:55:03,291 --> 00:55:08,270
about a Wallace Stevens, my, one of
my favorite poets, uh, you know, uh,

865
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:12,200
an ordinary evening in new haven.
We keep coming back and back to the rail,

866
00:55:12,290 --> 00:55:16,980
to the hotels and not to the hymns that
fall on it, out of the wind. Uh, you know,

867
00:55:16,981 --> 00:55:20,570
uh, uh, you know, reality
is the beginning, not the
end that the naked Alpha,

868
00:55:20,571 --> 00:55:22,130
not the higher infant and mega,
you know,

869
00:55:22,131 --> 00:55:27,131
he's kind of talking about the way that
our mind endlessly elaborates on what he

870
00:55:27,561 --> 00:55:32,300
calls the eyes of the eyes,
plane,

871
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:36,230
something vulgar of
experience. Um, you know,

872
00:55:36,231 --> 00:55:40,610
and it has all the great line, you know,
um, a poem is the cry of it's occasion,

873
00:55:40,611 --> 00:55:42,650
a part of the thing and not about it.
You know,

874
00:55:42,651 --> 00:55:47,651
this dialogue between the mind and the
stuff that we engage with in the world,

875
00:55:49,610 --> 00:55:51,860
you know,
is our life.

876
00:55:54,730 --> 00:55:59,680
Uh, there's so many
directions we could go. Uh, I,

877
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:04,430
well, I'm going to tie
this into a later question,

878
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:07,610
but I wanted to flash
back to Frank Herbert.

879
00:56:07,611 --> 00:56:12,200
You mentioned the name
and in, in passing, uh,

880
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:16,400
you wrote, as you mentioned, you as
an opportunity to write a biography.

881
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:17,900
It's correct me if I'm wrong,

882
00:56:17,901 --> 00:56:20,480
but a Frank Herbert who is
the author of the Dune series,

883
00:56:21,650 --> 00:56:23,800
Dune is

884
00:56:24,850 --> 00:56:26,950
one of those fiction books,

885
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:32,160
the first UN that shaped a lot of how
I look at the world in some pretty,

886
00:56:35,110 --> 00:56:38,760
uh, wide reaching ways. Uh,

887
00:56:39,310 --> 00:56:41,200
why did you decide to undertake that?

888
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:45,910
Were there any lessons that you took
away from studying his life or his work?

889
00:56:46,230 --> 00:56:49,040
I, you know, again, it was
a complete serendipity.

890
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:53,360
When my friend Dick Riley asked
me, yeah, when I write this book,

891
00:56:53,361 --> 00:56:55,930
he had been appointed the editor
of this new series of, you know,

892
00:56:55,940 --> 00:57:00,560
critical monographs, detective novelist
and science fiction novelist. Uh,

893
00:57:01,010 --> 00:57:02,780
uh, you know, I first said, oh,

894
00:57:02,781 --> 00:57:06,320
I wanted to write about Samuel
Delaney who was at the time,

895
00:57:06,321 --> 00:57:09,500
my favorite writer because I had a,

896
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:12,140
I love the little book of
his called Empire Star,

897
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:15,990
which was as you might expect about
the nature of consciousness. And, and,

898
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,420
and Dick was one said, no, no, no,
I think a book on herb, you know,

899
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:23,870
we'll do much better. You should really
do, do, do. And I had loved doing, well,

900
00:57:23,871 --> 00:57:27,830
I have a very funny story about it going
back to my childhood when I think I

901
00:57:27,831 --> 00:57:31,150
read it when I was 12 and I
got it from the library on.

902
00:57:31,151 --> 00:57:34,640
And I remember my dad picked me up
from the lake or said library in San

903
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:36,770
Francisco. And I was
used to get, you know,

904
00:57:36,771 --> 00:57:39,680
you could check out eight
books and they'll get eight,
you know, big books. And,

905
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:42,940
you know,
he looks at this and he says it's sinful.

906
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:45,410
So larger books should be
devoted to science fiction.

907
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:51,330
So I couldn't quite bring myself when I
wrote the Frag herb book to dedicate it

908
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:52,680
to my father with that.
Right.

909
00:57:56,550 --> 00:57:57,140
Ah,

910
00:57:57,140 --> 00:58:01,220
eh. Uh, but, uh, anyway, but, but yeah,

911
00:58:01,221 --> 00:58:05,210
I was really grateful to Dick Because,
uh, you know, I do, I can't, I mean,

912
00:58:05,211 --> 00:58:09,860
I had loved doing, but getting deeper
into it and spending time with frank,

913
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:14,330
you know, it was definitely
one of the, you know, he was,
he was the other, you know,

914
00:58:14,331 --> 00:58:17,870
I've had multiple fathers in my life,
which is a wonderful thing. You know,

915
00:58:17,930 --> 00:58:21,590
people who've kind of helped shape me,
you know,

916
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:26,740
and it does make me think that one of
the things that you know is so missing in

917
00:58:26,751 --> 00:58:30,890
our culture is that we
don't have enough fathers,

918
00:58:32,690 --> 00:58:35,870
mothers, you know, sort of like
when, when you think about, you know,

919
00:58:35,871 --> 00:58:39,560
how we were meant to be
raised, you know, in,

920
00:58:39,561 --> 00:58:44,360
in these communities, you know, the, uh,

921
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:46,040
you know, the, the, the sort of,

922
00:58:46,041 --> 00:58:49,700
the nuclear family is kind
of a crime against humanity.

923
00:58:50,650 --> 00:58:54,320
That's a strong word, but just like,
how do we build stronger communities?

924
00:58:54,321 --> 00:58:56,330
Because I think in my life,
you know,

925
00:58:56,331 --> 00:59:01,100
how important it was to have people
who said, you're special, you know,

926
00:59:01,101 --> 00:59:05,840
and I know you deeply and I see something
in you. And just to expect that, like,

927
00:59:06,290 --> 00:59:10,740
you know, to adult parents and the only
people who can do that for you. Yeah.

928
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:14,780
How do we build richer communities of
adults who help model and shape our

929
00:59:14,781 --> 00:59:15,140
children?

930
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:19,580
So I was just super lucky because I had
my own dad and I had George Simon and

931
00:59:19,581 --> 00:59:21,950
then it had frank Herbert
and I had, yeah, my, uh,

932
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:25,250
my ex wife's father Jack,
the guy named Jack Feldman,

933
00:59:25,251 --> 00:59:28,090
who kind of inspired me to
think about business. And yeah,

934
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:31,550
it was just so interested as I built
my business. You know, when he died,

935
00:59:31,551 --> 00:59:35,570
it was almost like I had been leaning
on this wind and I almost fell over,

936
00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:36,620
you know,
because it was,

937
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:40,730
it was just like I hadn't realized just
how much is continued to interest was

938
00:59:40,731 --> 00:59:45,660
feeding me, you know, it's
like, Eh, and uh, you know, the,

939
00:59:45,670 --> 00:59:50,030
the love and interest we can give
to other people is such a gift.

940
00:59:50,990 --> 00:59:54,380
Did you spend,
and I apologize that I don't know this,

941
00:59:54,381 --> 00:59:57,800
but I suppose it'd be boring if I knew
all the answers to my questions for this.

942
00:59:57,850 --> 01:00:00,830
Uh, did you spend time with
Frank Herbert or was it

943
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:05,760
oh yeah, I did. I did. You
know, I the, um, and it was,

944
01:00:05,761 --> 01:00:06,240
it was,

945
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:10,710
it was funny because I met with him
two or three times when I was writing.

946
01:00:10,711 --> 01:00:15,170
I did two books. The first book was
this, uh, you know, critical biography.

947
01:00:15,171 --> 01:00:19,050
And it was just really about his
books as much as about his life. Um,

948
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:23,000
and it only went up through,
uh, uh, doing messiah. You know,

949
01:00:23,010 --> 01:00:25,350
none of the later doing books
had been written and that point,

950
01:00:25,530 --> 01:00:28,760
which is fortunate because they
were just basically, you know,

951
01:00:28,770 --> 01:00:29,790
he was kind of milking the

952
01:00:30,990 --> 01:00:32,640
milking the golden franchises,

953
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:38,650
whereas the first three books were
really conceived of as a whole from the

954
01:00:38,651 --> 01:00:42,320
beginning. Uh, but, uh, and
then the second book was a
collection of his essays.

955
01:00:42,321 --> 01:00:44,310
So I, I basically, which I, you know,

956
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:47,890
I edited it and an interview,

957
01:00:47,891 --> 01:00:51,830
so I interviewed him on the road for
the first book. He would, you know,

958
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:54,090
be at some science fiction
convention and so on.

959
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:58,000
So I interviewed him two or three times,
I think in that period.

960
01:00:58,001 --> 01:01:02,770
Then what was sort of frustrating was I
wanted to get below the surface. He was,

961
01:01:02,771 --> 01:01:06,070
he was sort of like, he was a brilliant
conversation list and he kind of would,

962
01:01:06,450 --> 01:01:07,120
you know,

963
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:11,830
just very inspiring ideas about how
we have to live on the edge of crisis.

964
01:01:11,831 --> 01:01:15,160
And it's what keeps us alive.
And you know, it just, you know,

965
01:01:15,670 --> 01:01:20,350
it was just a fount of fascinating
ideas and, uh, you know,

966
01:01:20,351 --> 01:01:22,570
so it was scintillating stuff that,
you know,

967
01:01:22,571 --> 01:01:24,370
if you could do a do these
interviews, they, you know,

968
01:01:24,371 --> 01:01:26,140
you could publish them immediately,
you know,

969
01:01:26,141 --> 01:01:30,850
but I kind of wanted to get under the
surface and learn more about who he was

970
01:01:30,851 --> 01:01:35,260
and how he thought and,
but I couldn't because he was sort of on,

971
01:01:35,261 --> 01:01:38,890
cause he was on tour. Right. And then when
I did the second book where I was like,

972
01:01:38,891 --> 01:01:41,920
I need some more of these sort
of frank on fire interviews.

973
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,270
I went through it.
He

974
01:01:44,270 --> 01:01:47,660
was home in Port Townsend, Washington.
I know we hung out for a couple of days.

975
01:01:48,230 --> 01:01:50,150
And uh,
yeah,

976
01:01:50,151 --> 01:01:54,470
he was just mellow and relaxed and I
kind of learned all I got to know him and

977
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:57,800
you know, but it wasn't all this great
material and it was sort of like,

978
01:01:57,801 --> 01:02:02,470
I got the interviews in the wrong
order. So anyway, but he was a,

979
01:02:02,550 --> 01:02:06,760
he was a really wonderful
guy, uh, who, you know,

980
01:02:06,770 --> 01:02:08,510
thought very deeply about the world,

981
01:02:08,511 --> 01:02:12,790
had very prescient ideas about
the things that, uh, you know,

982
01:02:12,830 --> 01:02:17,330
continue to bedevil us today. I think
of many great lines, you know, uh,

983
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:20,580
um,
from his books all the time.

984
01:02:21,580 --> 01:02:24,130
Fear, fear is the mind killer. Yes.

985
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:27,850
And the desert and there's
so many good lines.

986
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:33,640
If you were to,
so I was a nonfiction purist for a very,

987
01:02:33,641 --> 01:02:37,600
very long time, for decades. I'm
embarrassed in retrospect to admit this,

988
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:41,860
but I was of the mind for a very long
time that if I wanted to make stuff up,

989
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:44,890
I could do that in my own head.
And I want it to actually learn things.

990
01:02:44,891 --> 01:02:49,240
By reading nonfiction, I've
realized how, at least for me,

991
01:02:49,450 --> 01:02:53,950
how off that was and how many deep
truths are better transmitted through

992
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:55,370
fiction,
uh,

993
01:02:56,260 --> 01:03:01,260
for nonfiction addicts who are willing
to have an intervention and read a few

994
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:02,341
fiction books.

995
01:03:02,341 --> 01:03:06,490
Are there any that you would suggest
that you might suggest people start with,

996
01:03:08,060 --> 01:03:09,090
Ooh,
that's so tough.

997
01:03:10,830 --> 01:03:14,520
Or to make it less pressured
a few of your favorites?

998
01:03:15,030 --> 01:03:19,350
Well, look this certain way, uh, you know,

999
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:23,850
books that have sort of shaped my life.
I mean, doing definitely one of them.

1000
01:03:24,390 --> 01:03:29,040
Uh, I highly recommend that,
uh, is, uh, another, uh,

1001
01:03:29,070 --> 01:03:32,910
fantasy book. I always not really
fantasy in the sense of, you know,

1002
01:03:32,911 --> 01:03:37,500
heroic fantasy that people think it is
a book called Islandia, uh, written. Uh,

1003
01:03:37,530 --> 01:03:42,060
it was actually a personal passion
project of a Boston lawyer named Austin

1004
01:03:42,061 --> 01:03:46,680
tapping. Right. Uh, it was just
an imaginary world. Uh, it was,

1005
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:50,940
it was probably the closest analog
in the real world is New Zealand.

1006
01:03:51,630 --> 01:03:52,120
Uh,
you know,

1007
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:55,620
was this pastoral country somewhere in
the southern hemisphere that had been

1008
01:03:55,621 --> 01:03:59,220
closed off to Western civilization. The
guy started writing it in like 19, 10,

1009
01:03:59,970 --> 01:04:04,920
and uh, uh, he died in a
car accident in 1930 or so,

1010
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:08,850
and in the mid forties,
43, I think it was,

1011
01:04:08,851 --> 01:04:13,440
his daughter had carved out of his, you
know, writings about some imaginary world,

1012
01:04:13,441 --> 01:04:14,274
this book Islandia,

1013
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:16,950
which was published and it actually made
it up to I think number three on the

1014
01:04:16,951 --> 01:04:20,190
New York Times bestseller list.
And it was rediscovered in the 70s,

1015
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:21,360
which is when I came across it.

1016
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:26,160
Wonderful Guide to kind of the values of,
you know,

1017
01:04:26,161 --> 01:04:30,210
living a slower life because it's
all about this guy who's, uh,

1018
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:35,760
you know, his roommate at Harvard
class of ought six, uh, was a, uh,

1019
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:39,670
uh, was from Islandia. And so
he learns to speak Islandia and,

1020
01:04:39,671 --> 01:04:42,050
and then when they're trying to
open up the country, he gets tapped.

1021
01:04:42,051 --> 01:04:45,190
It becomes the console and he's
sort of struggling with, you know,

1022
01:04:45,191 --> 01:04:49,410
the kind of like the modern way of life
versus this. I land in way of life in it.

1023
01:04:49,620 --> 01:04:53,640
A lot of people I've tried to
give it to find it too slow. Um,

1024
01:04:54,330 --> 01:04:58,770
but what a rich Cornucopia of
wisdom is in that book. Um,

1025
01:04:59,220 --> 01:05:02,250
you know, in terms of, of, uh, of, uh,

1026
01:05:04,290 --> 01:05:05,590
you know,
classics.

1027
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:06,943
I mean,

1028
01:05:07,660 --> 01:05:12,210
you can't do better than Jane Austin.
I mean for an understanding. And,

1029
01:05:12,310 --> 01:05:14,920
you know, the, the human soul,

1030
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:18,040
I still remember discovering
pride and prejudice. I think I was

1031
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:21,970
14 and that was a little embarrassed to
be reading what I saw was as a girl book.

1032
01:05:22,110 --> 01:05:25,330
Yeah. For sure. But it was like so good.

1033
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:31,570
And, uh, uh, in a similar vein, I,
I've come to love Anthony Trollope,

1034
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:35,440
uh, uh, because he's just, he's like,

1035
01:05:35,590 --> 01:05:37,330
let's get this plot stuff out of the way.

1036
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:40,860
I just want to talk about
the people and the ice.

1037
01:05:41,030 --> 01:05:43,690
He read a book like the warden that
you kind of go, I'm, oh my God,

1038
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:48,720
I'm reading a novel about the moral
quandaries of an 1850s British cleric and

1039
01:05:49,751 --> 01:05:53,750
it's fricking fast.
Uh,

1040
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:58,400
uh, I think of another, uh, uh,

1041
01:05:58,730 --> 01:06:03,580
a book when I read, uh, what
was it called? Night train
to Lisbon. And this is not,

1042
01:06:03,581 --> 01:06:06,370
I wouldn't say is in
that that same category,

1043
01:06:06,371 --> 01:06:11,080
but sometimes it's just a line in
a book. And this was, uh, you know,

1044
01:06:11,740 --> 01:06:15,730
that just changed my life in some ways.
It came at a critical juncture and it,

1045
01:06:15,731 --> 01:06:16,810
when I was 15,
it was,

1046
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:20,590
and the line was a given that
there is so much in all of us,

1047
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:25,690
what happens to the rest
and yeah,

1048
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:30,190
that kind of moment of cause. And that,
that hit this very deep. Pardon me,

1049
01:06:30,730 --> 01:06:31,630
when I was a teenager,

1050
01:06:31,631 --> 01:06:35,260
I used to have this fantasy that I
could live multiple lives, you know,

1051
01:06:35,380 --> 01:06:37,210
but I didn't want to just
kind of have a different life.

1052
01:06:37,211 --> 01:06:39,520
I wanted to have multiple
lives all at the same time.

1053
01:06:39,521 --> 01:06:43,810
I want it to be this multiplex person
who could be, you know, be multitudes.

1054
01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:48,700
The other thing I would just,
you know, highly recommend,

1055
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:52,300
highly recommend in addition
to fiction is poetry.

1056
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:53,630
Yeah.

1057
01:06:53,630 --> 01:06:54,540
You know,
I mean,

1058
01:06:55,140 --> 01:06:58,860
the thing that changed my
life with regard to poetry,

1059
01:06:58,861 --> 01:07:03,270
I'm not sure why it was, but, uh,
when I was a junior in high school,

1060
01:07:03,271 --> 01:07:07,530
I decided I wanted to get poetry and I
just picked up the collected poems of

1061
01:07:07,531 --> 01:07:10,110
William Butler Yeats. And I read
the entire book. It's, you know,

1062
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:14,400
three or 400 pages of poetry. And the
two things that I learned from that,

1063
01:07:14,401 --> 01:07:16,320
we want how to read poetry,
you know,

1064
01:07:16,321 --> 01:07:20,100
because a lot of people just
are unfamiliar with, you know,

1065
01:07:20,101 --> 01:07:24,000
kind of the stylized form.
But more than that,

1066
01:07:24,001 --> 01:07:27,960
what I learned was, oh, most of, you know,

1067
01:07:27,990 --> 01:07:32,550
20 of them do nothing for me.
And then there's one that just goes bang.

1068
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:38,780
And, um, you know, and so
learning that, you know,

1069
01:07:38,781 --> 01:07:41,700
and so many people don't learn
the love poetry because they,

1070
01:07:41,790 --> 01:07:46,790
they'd been forced fed 19 poems
and they never got to that 20th.

1071
01:07:46,921 --> 01:07:47,590
Paul.

1072
01:07:47,590 --> 01:07:51,700
Such a good point. It's such a good
point. I, uh, not to, not interject,

1073
01:07:51,701 --> 01:07:55,480
but I resisted poetry for far
longer than I resisted fiction,

1074
01:07:55,481 --> 01:07:58,880
which is saying a lot. And then, uh,

1075
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:00,520
interviewed actually a friend of mine,

1076
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:03,550
a Rolf Potts who wrote a
wonderful book called vagabonding,

1077
01:08:03,551 --> 01:08:07,220
which I took around the world
for me for 18 months and 2004,

1078
01:08:07,221 --> 01:08:11,710
2005 and he suggested a few
starter books for poetry.

1079
01:08:11,830 --> 01:08:16,580
And later I ended up
picking up a fantastic, uh,

1080
01:08:16,590 --> 01:08:21,270
roomy collection by, I think at Coleman
Barks. I want to say the name is

1081
01:08:22,910 --> 01:08:27,890
the introduction alone to that book will
make the hair stand up on your arms if

1082
01:08:27,891 --> 01:08:31,300
you have hairy arms, maybe
somewhere else otherwise end. Uh,

1083
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:35,180
I found when I asked a very good
friend of mine has a huge Rumi Fan,

1084
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:39,260
how should I read Ruminy he
said exactly what you just said.

1085
01:08:39,380 --> 01:08:44,380
He said you need to read a lot of
them because for me it's every 15th,

1086
01:08:46,101 --> 01:08:50,060
every 20th. That just really grabs me
and I know is going to stick with me.

1087
01:08:50,780 --> 01:08:51,500
Uh,

1088
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:56,000
so not expecting that you're going to
get or like every single one of them.

1089
01:08:57,020 --> 01:09:01,040
Uh, are there any places that you would
suggest people potentially start when it

1090
01:09:01,041 --> 01:09:02,630
comes to poetry?

1091
01:09:03,430 --> 01:09:06,120
Well, I think you pick up
a good one. I actually, uh,

1092
01:09:06,310 --> 01:09:09,730
my exposure to a copier room,
he came through Robert Bly.

1093
01:09:09,750 --> 01:09:13,840
I loved Robert Bly is Kabir book. Uh,
what I liked Coleman barks a lot as well.

1094
01:09:14,590 --> 01:09:19,120
Uh, does father the Steven
Mitchell additions. Um, but,

1095
01:09:19,180 --> 01:09:24,050
uh, you know, you know,

1096
01:09:24,140 --> 01:09:27,140
this just good collections of poetry,
you know,

1097
01:09:27,170 --> 01:09:32,030
and the poems or the English
language or, um, you know,

1098
01:09:32,730 --> 01:09:36,410
I personally, I, you know, maybe it's
too intellectual for most people,

1099
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:40,970
but a Wallace Stevens, go find a
couple of poems of Wallace Stevens.

1100
01:09:41,180 --> 01:09:46,180
If you can't read a mere being or
aesthetic demal and come to some like,

1101
01:09:47,420 --> 01:09:50,270
oh my God, this magical, then, you know,

1102
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:51,553
uh,

1103
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:56,960
again, he's, he's particularly
difficult because this is a, or an, oh,

1104
01:09:56,961 --> 01:09:58,550
actually here,
this is where I would start,

1105
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:00,733
uh,

1106
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:06,280
east coker by ts Eliot. Oh my God.
That, that's one of my favorite poems.

1107
01:10:06,281 --> 01:10:10,870
It's about death and rebirth and,
and, and uh, unbelievably good.

1108
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:16,120
Yeah. Tsla, it's hard to go
wrong with. Yeah. So I, I've,

1109
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:21,140
I wanted to come back to living multiple
lives and having multitudes contained

1110
01:10:25,270 --> 01:10:29,770
within a single person because I
think you have lived many, many. Yeah.

1111
01:10:30,340 --> 01:10:35,280
And My basketball. And, uh, I have
more questions on books and I'll,

1112
01:10:35,281 --> 01:10:37,150
I'll just give out a teaser.
We'll come back to this,

1113
01:10:37,151 --> 01:10:41,800
but I've heard from a reliable sources
that you love to read old bestsellers

1114
01:10:41,801 --> 01:10:44,710
from generations ago that
are now long forgotten.

1115
01:10:44,711 --> 01:10:47,290
So I want to find out why we're
going to come back to that.

1116
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:52,090
But since a lot of people listening are
curious about the edge that you often

1117
01:10:52,091 --> 01:10:56,920
find. So in 1993, you launched,

1118
01:10:56,990 --> 01:11:00,970
uh, the global network navigators. I
understand it. The first web portal,

1119
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:04,210
first site to be supported
by banner ads and

1120
01:11:04,670 --> 01:11:08,790
Oh, call me, correct you on
that. Not Beginner banner
ads came two years later. Ah,

1121
01:11:08,791 --> 01:11:12,800
okay. The very first ads
were much closer to, um,

1122
01:11:13,290 --> 01:11:17,580
yellow page ads. And the reason was that
there were only 200 websites, right?

1123
01:11:17,581 --> 01:11:21,030
So we basically were like, hey, we
can put content for you on the web.

1124
01:11:21,031 --> 01:11:23,580
So it was close to putting up a website.

1125
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:26,480
Then it was the putting
up a banner banner ad.

1126
01:11:26,510 --> 01:11:29,460
It didn't come until the word off websites
that you could point people somewhere

1127
01:11:29,461 --> 01:11:30,294
else.

1128
01:11:31,340 --> 01:11:32,600
Good point.
That's a very good point.

1129
01:11:32,990 --> 01:11:37,990
And the AOL bought it in 95.

1130
01:11:38,361 --> 01:11:40,190
Is that right? That's correct. Okay.

1131
01:11:41,570 --> 01:11:46,570
Why do you think you were the first
or one of the first to recognize this

1132
01:11:48,141 --> 01:11:52,100
opportunity? Uh, meaning
ad supported web portal?

1133
01:11:52,540 --> 01:11:53,373
Uh,

1134
01:11:54,700 --> 01:11:59,220
well, well, first of all, uh, I, I
should be clear that, um, you know,

1135
01:11:59,221 --> 01:12:02,670
I came up with the ad supported
part. Uh, Dale Doherty,

1136
01:12:02,671 --> 01:12:06,090
who was one of my key people at
O'Reilly media for many years,

1137
01:12:06,091 --> 01:12:08,910
went on to actually start
make magazine and maker faire.

1138
01:12:08,911 --> 01:12:12,840
And we spun out that into a separate
company called maker media was the one who

1139
01:12:12,841 --> 01:12:17,400
kind of discovered the worldwide web
for us. And it was really following,

1140
01:12:18,130 --> 01:12:22,110
you know, earlier threads in our
business. Uh, uh, Dale had been very,

1141
01:12:22,111 --> 01:12:26,060
very interested in, um,
online publishing. Yeah.

1142
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:28,950
In 1987,

1143
01:12:28,980 --> 01:12:31,140
he had created our first ebook,

1144
01:12:31,650 --> 01:12:36,020
which was a hypercard version
of, uh, of a book I had,

1145
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:40,560
I had created called Unix
in a nutshell. And, uh,

1146
01:12:41,250 --> 01:12:44,070
so he had been pursuing, uh, you know,

1147
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:49,290
ebooks and we, uh, he'd started something.

1148
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:53,420
Uh, actually I may have the timing
wrong, but I think it's all right.

1149
01:12:53,430 --> 01:12:56,220
So we had been basically
trying to figure out how to we,

1150
01:12:56,221 --> 01:13:00,990
and we had these books on something
called the x Windows system and we started

1151
01:13:00,991 --> 01:13:02,340
working, uh, this,

1152
01:13:02,341 --> 01:13:06,420
this is before XML existed with something
called SGML standard generalized

1153
01:13:06,421 --> 01:13:09,090
markup language,
which is before the web.

1154
01:13:09,570 --> 01:13:13,930
And we were trying to figure out how
to represent our books, you know,

1155
01:13:13,950 --> 01:13:15,120
for online publishing.

1156
01:13:16,110 --> 01:13:20,970
And there was a piece of pattern
recognition that I had done, which was,

1157
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:23,040
oh, you know, um,

1158
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:25,273
uh,

1159
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:28,380
you know,
the world,

1160
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:33,280
they're starting to be a lot of of
commercial software products for reading

1161
01:13:33,281 --> 01:13:34,114
books.

1162
01:13:34,570 --> 01:13:39,570
But I felt like we needed a standard of
some kind for our online content because

1163
01:13:39,911 --> 01:13:41,350
we weren't going to be a software company,

1164
01:13:41,351 --> 01:13:43,690
but we wanted everybody to be
able to read the same content.

1165
01:13:43,691 --> 01:13:46,190
This was sort of inspired by,
yeah,

1166
01:13:46,210 --> 01:13:50,740
we were a documentation consulting company
and we worked with this guy who had

1167
01:13:50,741 --> 01:13:53,920
to maintain 200 different
versions of his software.

1168
01:13:55,450 --> 01:13:57,880
And we were like, screw this, you know,

1169
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:01,550
so because we had all these people
who are coming to us because our, our,

1170
01:14:01,551 --> 01:14:05,830
our x books had been adopted as the
documentation by a bunch of, you know,

1171
01:14:06,010 --> 01:14:10,300
Unix work station companies.
And HP had answer book and you know,

1172
01:14:10,301 --> 01:14:14,440
son had info explorer and you
know, so there were like five, six,

1173
01:14:14,441 --> 01:14:16,930
seven different kind of, and we said, no,

1174
01:14:16,931 --> 01:14:19,510
we want to have one format
that everybody reads.

1175
01:14:19,930 --> 01:14:22,810
And so Dale had started working
on developing that format,

1176
01:14:22,811 --> 01:14:25,930
which can be called doc book.
And uh,

1177
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:30,250
it was really for representing technical
books in, you know, in a markup language.

1178
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:32,090
But then we realize,
and we,

1179
01:14:32,110 --> 01:14:35,290
one of the things that we learn
from the x window system, you know,

1180
01:14:35,291 --> 01:14:38,430
this is Bob Scheiffer had kind of
told us this. He said, look, you know,

1181
01:14:38,750 --> 01:14:42,650
you know what? We really are the way
that we use free software. You know,

1182
01:14:42,660 --> 01:14:46,930
this is a big contrast to, you
know, how, you know, uh, you know,

1183
01:14:46,931 --> 01:14:51,040
Linux grew up was simply we're trying
to build a reference implement,

1184
01:14:51,041 --> 01:14:52,540
not naming a reference implementation,

1185
01:14:52,541 --> 01:14:55,240
a sample implementation
that people can improve on.

1186
01:14:56,320 --> 01:15:01,320
And so we had this idea that we
needed a free book browser and date.

1187
01:15:04,011 --> 01:15:06,850
I'll discover this tool called Biola,
uh,

1188
01:15:06,851 --> 01:15:10,990
which was really the first graphical
web browser and that led into the web.

1189
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:15,800
And then, uh, you know, Dale
introduced me to Tim Berners Lee and,

1190
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:16,690
and Dale was like,

1191
01:15:16,691 --> 01:15:19,870
we were just publishing our first book
about the Internet book called the whole

1192
01:15:19,871 --> 01:15:21,190
Internet users guide catalog,

1193
01:15:21,191 --> 01:15:26,050
which we publish in 1993 and uh,
are actually 92,

1194
01:15:26,051 --> 01:15:29,940
fall in 92. And uh, he,

1195
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:34,450
he had a catalog in the back, uh, of, of
Er interesting Internet sites. You know,

1196
01:15:34,451 --> 01:15:37,630
if you tell that to this site, you'll get
earthquake information if you, you know,

1197
01:15:37,631 --> 01:15:40,230
it was go for the, the web. We
actually, Dale was on, I said,

1198
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:43,450
we got to have the web in here. There
were only 200 websites. And we, you know,

1199
01:15:43,451 --> 01:15:46,510
the editor, Mike Luca is actually wrote
a chapter of the last minute right,

1200
01:15:46,530 --> 01:15:51,160
for publication. It's so we can
slip it in, but then pay way.

1201
01:15:51,161 --> 01:15:55,090
Who was the, he was a student at the
time, that guy had written viola,

1202
01:15:55,870 --> 01:15:58,030
you know, uh, uh, I said, well,

1203
01:15:58,031 --> 01:16:02,690
I can make a cool demo for the catalog in
the back of the book, you know, and the,

1204
01:16:02,710 --> 01:16:05,920
the, the, the catalog was, um,

1205
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:11,380
it was kind of this list of couple of
hundred interesting sites on the Internet

1206
01:16:11,381 --> 01:16:16,030
that people could try out. And uh, so
he built this thing and it was, uh,

1207
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:20,230
it was basically a point and click
catalog of the, uh, of the early Internet.

1208
01:16:20,740 --> 01:16:23,350
And I said, hey, that's not
a demo. That's a product.

1209
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:29,640
And so our first idea was that
the internet was still very early.

1210
01:16:29,861 --> 01:16:33,730
So we, our first idea was we were going
to build a kiosk so people could try the

1211
01:16:33,731 --> 01:16:37,990
Internet using this point and click
interface. And so that was what we built.

1212
01:16:37,991 --> 01:16:40,150
And then Dale wanted to
deal with a magazine,

1213
01:16:40,330 --> 01:16:43,630
kind of like what make magazine became
for the maker Movement about the early

1214
01:16:43,631 --> 01:16:45,960
people over the web. And I said, you know,

1215
01:16:46,130 --> 01:16:48,340
he originally thought of as a
quarterly magazine. I said, no,

1216
01:16:48,341 --> 01:16:49,570
actually I think they all,

1217
01:16:49,571 --> 01:16:52,510
I think people are going to have the web
open on there. Uh, you know, there'll be,

1218
01:16:52,511 --> 01:16:54,450
there'll be looking at the
way of every day, you know,

1219
01:16:54,970 --> 01:16:58,120
so we have to have it constantly updated
and we kind of brainstormed back and

1220
01:16:58,121 --> 01:17:01,960
forth and you know, we kind of developed,
so there was the catalog component,

1221
01:17:02,020 --> 01:17:03,640
which was part of what we were doing and,

1222
01:17:04,180 --> 01:17:08,980
and then kind of articles about the people
behind this, you know, this new thing.

1223
01:17:09,660 --> 01:17:12,900
And I was just kind of looking at my
desk one day and then, you know, kind of,

1224
01:17:12,901 --> 01:17:17,880
we followed the industry through these
print magazines and, uh, you know,

1225
01:17:17,881 --> 01:17:20,550
the way they worked was
there were articles in,

1226
01:17:20,551 --> 01:17:23,870
there were ads and there was a
Bingo card in the middle, you know,

1227
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:27,840
which is this card with, you know, kind
of like ms giant matrix of numbers.

1228
01:17:28,170 --> 01:17:33,030
Like a multiple choice exam because then
you would circle 82 and the ad or the

1229
01:17:33,031 --> 01:17:34,350
article,
you know,

1230
01:17:35,010 --> 01:17:38,520
corresponding to number 82 would
send you a package in the mail.

1231
01:17:38,580 --> 01:17:41,730
I remember those. And I thought,
that's really inefficient.

1232
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:44,760
We could do that on the web, you know, so,

1233
01:17:44,761 --> 01:17:48,870
so we can deliver the
information directly. So, uh,

1234
01:17:48,900 --> 01:17:51,240
that was the original vision.
And it's sort of funny.

1235
01:17:51,241 --> 01:17:56,190
So the advertising that we invented
for the web was really the,

1236
01:17:56,191 --> 01:17:58,110
I was really the website,

1237
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:01,320
the commercial website
because up to that point,

1238
01:18:01,321 --> 01:18:06,090
there were no commercial websites,
you know. And so the, the banner ad,

1239
01:18:06,210 --> 01:18:07,710
it was this much later layer,

1240
01:18:07,711 --> 01:18:10,560
which is simply the idea that you
could build a commercial website that

1241
01:18:10,561 --> 01:18:13,530
advertise your product or service
and gave you information about it.

1242
01:18:14,820 --> 01:18:19,050
So their first ad we did was effectively
a website for our, our law firm.

1243
01:18:19,610 --> 01:18:22,050
You know, uh, you know, within Gnn.

1244
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:25,050
It wasn't because we didn't set
up the entire website, but it was,

1245
01:18:25,051 --> 01:18:29,630
it was literally, um, um, you
know, just, here's Hillary,

1246
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:33,780
Roman white McCall. If, here's what we
do, here is how to reach us. And, and uh,

1247
01:18:34,310 --> 01:18:38,510
you know, yeah, it was an ad. It was
a, so we had this sort of uh, uh,

1248
01:18:38,820 --> 01:18:41,460
directory, you know, cattle.
We had this sort of, hey,

1249
01:18:41,461 --> 01:18:43,980
here are all these cool sites and
now here's the commercial catalog.

1250
01:18:45,350 --> 01:18:48,150
So, so I wanted to, uh,

1251
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:53,730
just to confirm something about the
whole Internet users guide and catalog.

1252
01:18:53,790 --> 01:18:54,501
So this,

1253
01:18:54,501 --> 01:18:59,501
this book you mentioned 92 and in a
piece titled the Oracle Silicon Valley,

1254
01:19:01,860 --> 01:19:05,910
I think it's just an ink.
Uh, there's a, there's,

1255
01:19:05,911 --> 01:19:10,150
there's a description of one of your
marketing approaches and says to market a

1256
01:19:10,151 --> 01:19:13,620
general interest book from
a small publisher about a
relatively obscure topic or

1257
01:19:13,621 --> 01:19:17,340
Riley devised a novel marketing strategy.
He would turn himself into an activist.

1258
01:19:17,341 --> 01:19:21,240
He hired the former director of activism
from the Sierra Club and devised a

1259
01:19:21,241 --> 01:19:23,190
campaign that treated the
adoption of the Internet,

1260
01:19:23,191 --> 01:19:25,010
like the effort to save the rain forest,

1261
01:19:25,011 --> 01:19:28,110
emailed copies of the book to every member
of Congress and then went on a media

1262
01:19:28,111 --> 01:19:31,650
tour in New York City in Washington DC.
And then this is a quote from you,

1263
01:19:31,651 --> 01:19:35,790
I was saying the Internet is coming.
The Internet is coming. He says, uh,

1264
01:19:35,791 --> 01:19:39,090
and O'Reilly media, has the owner had the
only book that could explain it to you?

1265
01:19:39,450 --> 01:19:43,800
Is there anything that you would add to
that? Anything you would correct? I just,

1266
01:19:43,801 --> 01:19:48,270
it's, it's a, it's a fascinating
story, but that's all I have

1267
01:19:48,660 --> 01:19:52,770
as is the case in so many
of these stories. You know,

1268
01:19:52,780 --> 01:19:56,820
there's sort of the hero story. It wasn't
my idea to do that. It was this guy,

1269
01:19:56,821 --> 01:20:00,850
Brian Irwin. We had
hired Brian Darwin, uh,

1270
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:04,260
from the Sierra Club and yeah, we were
able to hire, we were up in Sebastopol.

1271
01:20:04,261 --> 01:20:06,750
He was actually commuting
down to San Francisco. Wow.

1272
01:20:06,751 --> 01:20:09,840
This a is a company up here
that might be interesting. Uh,

1273
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:12,660
and then he came in and he said,
you know,

1274
01:20:12,690 --> 01:20:16,050
he is the one who taught me about
activism. It wasn't like I had this idea,

1275
01:20:16,051 --> 01:20:16,884
it was like,
no,

1276
01:20:16,980 --> 01:20:21,630
Brian was this master of activist and
then he invented early Internet marketing

1277
01:20:21,631 --> 01:20:25,380
and he's kind of one of the unsung
heroes, you know, he was the one who said,

1278
01:20:25,770 --> 01:20:28,260
first of all, he, he, you know,
he, when he said to me is like,

1279
01:20:28,261 --> 01:20:30,910
people are not going to care
about our book. You know,

1280
01:20:31,110 --> 01:20:35,280
we want to make them care about the
internet. And uh, that was real really.

1281
01:20:35,281 --> 01:20:39,540
He taught me about marketing as activism
about big ideas and he was the one who

1282
01:20:39,541 --> 01:20:42,650
said, we're going to go do a
press tour about the internet. Uh,

1283
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:44,500
and he also gave way,
you know,

1284
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:48,780
copies of the Internet to people who
are unused that uh, you know, uh,

1285
01:20:48,810 --> 01:20:52,440
really kind of pioneered a lot of tea
influence or marketing techniques.

1286
01:20:52,441 --> 01:20:57,000
This is 1992. Um, and uh, you
know, he's kind of, it, it's, it's,

1287
01:20:57,010 --> 01:21:01,170
it's sort of sad that he has
not gotten enough credit.

1288
01:21:01,171 --> 01:21:05,520
I always try to say his name again. Brian
Irwin, how do you spell his last name?

1289
01:21:05,940 --> 01:21:09,510
Er Win is in, in, I think he's still,

1290
01:21:09,580 --> 01:21:14,520
he left the company around
2000. Uh, and he, he's,

1291
01:21:14,790 --> 01:21:19,220
I think he, he's, he's a marketing
consultant still. Uh, and, and, uh,

1292
01:21:19,980 --> 01:21:21,480
uh,
living in Santa Rosa.

1293
01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:25,880
All right. I'll track them down
and send a link is way, uh,

1294
01:21:26,290 --> 01:21:27,123
the,

1295
01:21:27,850 --> 01:21:31,580
the observation that you brought up about
the cards in the magazines where you

1296
01:21:31,581 --> 01:21:34,790
circle number 82, that's
really inefficient, right?

1297
01:21:34,791 --> 01:21:38,240
So this also kind of relates to the how,

1298
01:21:38,510 --> 01:21:42,230
how can we make x easier for people?
Uh,

1299
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:43,940
so could you,

1300
01:21:44,570 --> 01:21:48,980
these types of questions or
heuristics are interesting to me.

1301
01:21:49,390 --> 01:21:52,970
Uh,
and I'd love if you could elaborate a bit.

1302
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,190
I actually don't know this name,
I'm embarrassed to say,

1303
01:21:55,191 --> 01:21:59,990
but Hal Varian and his observation that
if you want to understand the future,

1304
01:21:59,991 --> 01:22:04,250
just look at what rich people do today.
Could you elaborate on that please?

1305
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:08,180
Well, first off, uh, how, uh, you know,

1306
01:22:08,290 --> 01:22:12,300
first came into my Ken because he
was the chief economist at Google.

1307
01:22:12,301 --> 01:22:15,480
He was the guy who figured out a bunch
of things about the Google ad auction

1308
01:22:15,481 --> 01:22:20,310
that made Google such an
economic powerhouse. So, uh,
but it turns out he was also,

1309
01:22:21,180 --> 01:22:25,290
he wrote the textbook on microeconomics
that almost every economist learned from,

1310
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:26,760
uh, you know, learn from. So.

1311
01:22:27,230 --> 01:22:28,063
MMM.

1312
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:33,820
Uh, but yeah, he, he, he's
made that comment famously,

1313
01:22:34,420 --> 01:22:38,440
and I remember talking with him one night,

1314
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:43,000
we was dinner with me and Andy Mcafee and
Erik Brynjolfsson, the office of, of, uh,

1315
01:22:43,030 --> 01:22:47,680
the second machine age and machine
platform crowd and, uh, Carl Shapiro,

1316
01:22:47,681 --> 01:22:51,020
the guy with whom, how had written
a book called information rule.

1317
01:22:51,021 --> 01:22:55,510
So you've been one of panels,
Grad students when he was
teaching at Berkeley. And,

1318
01:22:55,780 --> 01:22:57,550
uh,
um,

1319
01:22:59,010 --> 01:23:03,250
Carl had just been at the White House
and he was a reacting with horror at the

1320
01:23:03,251 --> 01:23:08,020
statement of house, you know,
and it, you know, it's like,
it sounds like, oh my God,

1321
01:23:08,021 --> 01:23:13,021
this is the worst silicon valley
libertarian kind of observation.

1322
01:23:13,601 --> 01:23:16,210
And it's very easy for people
to react that way to it.

1323
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:20,800
But yet if you think about
it, you know, it's like, Ooh,

1324
01:23:20,801 --> 01:23:24,880
first owned automobiles, rich people,
you know, who first owned cell phones,

1325
01:23:24,881 --> 01:23:29,830
rich people, you know, rich people used
to fly, uh, you know, or, or not fly.

1326
01:23:29,831 --> 01:23:31,660
They would do the grand tour of Europe,
you know,

1327
01:23:31,750 --> 01:23:36,370
now soccer hooligans follow their, you
know, their team around Europe, you know,

1328
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:40,400
and, uh, uh, their whole,
you know, uh, you know,

1329
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:44,410
rich people used to eat out, you know,
now everybody eats out, you know,

1330
01:23:44,411 --> 01:23:46,510
it's like more people eat
out and then cook, you know.

1331
01:23:46,510 --> 01:23:51,510
And so it really is a really interesting
tool for thinking and tool for seeing,

1332
01:23:53,560 --> 01:23:58,090
you know, and I think that's kind of
like a such a key concept for me is,

1333
01:23:58,750 --> 01:23:59,920
uh,
you know,

1334
01:24:00,190 --> 01:24:03,610
people on this kind of goes back to the
structural differential and people kind

1335
01:24:03,611 --> 01:24:07,600
of trying to, you know, judge
ideas against other ideas.

1336
01:24:07,601 --> 01:24:11,710
Is it some kind of zero sum game?
You know? And it's like, no,

1337
01:24:11,711 --> 01:24:15,840
all of these things in a reality is,
uh,

1338
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:19,990
is infinite. You know, reality
is far more than any of the,

1339
01:24:20,010 --> 01:24:24,610
the nets we weave to catch it in.
All right? So if you accept that,

1340
01:24:24,700 --> 01:24:28,720
then you kind of go, these are simply
tools to help us see. And so I go,

1341
01:24:28,721 --> 01:24:32,830
does this help me see? Yes. And so,
for example, in my forthcoming book,

1342
01:24:32,860 --> 01:24:36,520
there's a whole chapter that's in some
ways based on this juice, it's called,

1343
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:41,380
why we'll never run out of jobs, you
know, and it's because, you know, uh,

1344
01:24:41,530 --> 01:24:42,660
uh, you know, you,

1345
01:24:42,661 --> 01:24:46,630
you look at what happens
in rich societies and,

1346
01:24:46,810 --> 01:24:51,280
and how basically commodity products get
elaborated in more and more ways. So,

1347
01:24:51,390 --> 01:24:52,300
you know,
look,

1348
01:24:52,301 --> 01:24:55,810
think about craft beers that are
more expensive than commodity beers.

1349
01:24:55,990 --> 01:25:00,820
Think about specialty coffees that are
more, you know, uh, expensive than,

1350
01:25:00,910 --> 01:25:03,160
than, uh, commodity coffee. Right?

1351
01:25:03,490 --> 01:25:06,760
And what's added in a lot of ways,

1352
01:25:06,761 --> 01:25:10,540
it's a story that's added,
you know, and yes, sure,

1353
01:25:10,541 --> 01:25:14,050
the story has physical components.
You know, this came from,

1354
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:18,010
this copy is actually address
Alexis madrigals a containers.

1355
01:25:18,011 --> 01:25:19,960
Podcasts is fabulous.
This subject.

1356
01:25:19,961 --> 01:25:22,400
Then episode four is about
the history of [inaudible].

1357
01:25:22,410 --> 01:25:25,870
So the evolution of the coffee,
uh, market, but, you know, yeah,

1358
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:28,660
this coffee came from this particular,
you know,

1359
01:25:28,661 --> 01:25:33,660
coffee plantation and Guatemala. Uh,
you know, all the things that, that,

1360
01:25:33,850 --> 01:25:37,810
you know, have to come into
place, uh, to make that, you know,

1361
01:25:37,870 --> 01:25:40,240
bring that to, you know, uh,

1362
01:25:40,540 --> 01:25:45,540
a particular coffee roaster and they
tell that story and as a result of that

1363
01:25:45,971 --> 01:25:47,110
story and,
and,

1364
01:25:47,111 --> 01:25:51,130
and the reality that goes with the story
that this is actually a unique flavor.

1365
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:54,130
You know, of course, if it doesn't
match, if it doesn't deliver,

1366
01:25:54,131 --> 01:25:58,030
then people got not much to the story.
But if it delivers that people, yes,

1367
01:25:58,031 --> 01:26:02,410
they will pay more. And so this
is why I believe that, you know,

1368
01:26:02,411 --> 01:26:07,160
like as we commoditize labor, there's,
or one of the reasons I should say,

1369
01:26:08,380 --> 01:26:13,190
you know, with Ai, with robots, you know,
we can find new things for people to do.

1370
01:26:13,191 --> 01:26:17,930
I mean, there's three things.
First of all, again, this
is a major theme of my book,

1371
01:26:17,931 --> 01:26:21,700
which we haven't really talked about,
but let's get into it. You know,

1372
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:25,880
one is there's plenty of work to
do for Christ's sake, you know,

1373
01:26:25,881 --> 01:26:30,780
so the big question is not,
you know, in know, you know,

1374
01:26:30,890 --> 01:26:34,430
we talked too much about jobs and
not enough about work. Because if we,

1375
01:26:34,550 --> 01:26:37,160
if we focused on what work needs doing,

1376
01:26:37,550 --> 01:26:41,090
then we start to ask what's
keeping us from doing that work?

1377
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:44,930
And we realized that there's something
broken in our economic system that's made

1378
01:26:45,140 --> 01:26:49,340
diverting our energy and investment away
from doing the work that needs doing

1379
01:26:49,730 --> 01:26:52,840
towards, you know, financial
games, you know, and,

1380
01:26:52,841 --> 01:26:55,970
and people who are sort of extracting
money from the economy without actually

1381
01:26:55,971 --> 01:26:59,000
getting the work done that we need doing.
So that's one piece.

1382
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:01,610
The second thing is obviously,
you know,

1383
01:27:01,611 --> 01:27:06,260
this all this work being
done that, uh, you know,

1384
01:27:06,290 --> 01:27:08,160
is not being compensated for now,

1385
01:27:08,180 --> 01:27:12,890
I have this sort of metaphoric
can't originally came to
me in the context of, of,

1386
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:16,620
um, open source software. Uh,

1387
01:27:16,710 --> 01:27:21,540
but it really can't entered
my consciousness as a
mental tool, uh, in the 70s,

1388
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:24,810
uh, when I read it and in Stewart
brand's coalition quarterly,

1389
01:27:25,130 --> 01:27:27,420
I was a concept called
the clothesline paradox,

1390
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:31,830
which is this thing is that simply
disappear from our economic accounting.

1391
01:27:31,890 --> 01:27:35,370
You know, so you think about, uh,
uh, and the clothesline paradox,

1392
01:27:35,371 --> 01:27:39,420
it really was like, okay, we're
measuring solar energy versus, uh,

1393
01:27:39,560 --> 01:27:42,060
in renewables versus fossil fuels.

1394
01:27:42,570 --> 01:27:46,080
And if somebody puts their
clothes in the dryer,

1395
01:27:46,140 --> 01:27:47,640
it's fossil fuel usage.

1396
01:27:47,970 --> 01:27:50,730
But if somebody takes the clothes
and putting them on the line,

1397
01:27:50,910 --> 01:27:55,590
it doesn't accrue to the solar
column. Right. And, uh, you know,

1398
01:27:55,591 --> 01:27:58,770
and I kind of made an analogy
from that to open source software,

1399
01:27:58,771 --> 01:28:02,640
which sort of disappeared
from our economic accounting
for so long before people

1400
01:28:02,641 --> 01:28:06,180
like Google and Amazon and figured out
how to build enormous businesses on top

1401
01:28:06,181 --> 01:28:10,560
of it. Um, but you know, if you
look at our economy today, you know,

1402
01:28:10,561 --> 01:28:15,200
it's like taking care of people.
Yeah. Mostly uncompensated, you know,

1403
01:28:15,550 --> 01:28:20,010
a lot of creativity, you know, poorly
compensated. You know, it's like,

1404
01:28:20,280 --> 01:28:24,870
why is it, you know, if these things
there are so valuable, don't get paid for,

1405
01:28:24,900 --> 01:28:26,540
right. They're, they're,
they're, they're you,

1406
01:28:26,920 --> 01:28:31,500
they're taken out of the
economic paradigm. We need to
fix that. And, and you know,

1407
01:28:31,501 --> 01:28:34,050
it's not necessarily saying, well,
that must pay for this, you know,

1408
01:28:34,051 --> 01:28:35,790
cause the people all supply and demand,

1409
01:28:35,791 --> 01:28:40,080
there's all kinds of hacks that
the societies have used, uh,

1410
01:28:40,230 --> 01:28:44,280
to value things differently. You know,
just a good example is child labor.

1411
01:28:44,850 --> 01:28:48,330
You know, how did we, so we
didn't start, you know, saying,

1412
01:28:48,331 --> 01:28:50,960
well we have to pay children more.
No,

1413
01:28:51,270 --> 01:28:55,240
we're going to stop using
them for this thing. Right?

1414
01:28:56,040 --> 01:28:59,690
And that actually it actually reduced
the workforce that we reduced working

1415
01:28:59,690 --> 01:29:02,040
hours. And what did we do with
that? We sent them to school.

1416
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:03,370
Okay.

1417
01:29:03,370 --> 01:29:03,620
Right.

1418
01:29:03,620 --> 01:29:08,510
We actually paid as a society sent kids
to school and then later we don't need

1419
01:29:08,511 --> 01:29:13,430
all these teenagers on the farms
anymore. Oh, let's send them to school.

1420
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:14,840
You know, it was blessed, you know,

1421
01:29:14,841 --> 01:29:17,490
and then the high school movement
started around 1909, you know,

1422
01:29:17,810 --> 01:29:21,560
9% of Americans went
to high school in 1909.

1423
01:29:21,740 --> 01:29:25,190
By 1935 it was about 70%.
You know,

1424
01:29:25,210 --> 01:29:27,710
it's like this amazing social revolution,
you know,

1425
01:29:27,711 --> 01:29:32,270
so what is it that we could do today
around like, okay, let's actually,

1426
01:29:32,390 --> 01:29:33,560
it doesn't have to be that we,

1427
01:29:33,580 --> 01:29:37,550
we start paying people could be
that we do universal basic income,

1428
01:29:37,820 --> 01:29:42,140
but we some we somehow need to
revalue some of the things, you know,

1429
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:47,070
education, you know, creativity,
caring in our economy. And again, uh,

1430
01:29:47,160 --> 01:29:49,190
in that whole creativity economy,

1431
01:29:49,370 --> 01:29:54,290
you have to understand that that economy
writ large is wrapped up in that Hal

1432
01:29:54,290 --> 01:29:58,770
Varian statement. Because
if you look, you know,

1433
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:03,110
I mentioned coffee and beer, but
just food in general, you know,

1434
01:30:03,111 --> 01:30:06,880
2% of our population now, uh, you know,

1435
01:30:07,010 --> 01:30:10,820
in the u s works in agriculture,
right?

1436
01:30:11,090 --> 01:30:15,380
Yet we have more variety of foods and we
ever had in the day when we all worked

1437
01:30:15,381 --> 01:30:19,880
in agriculture, that design pattern
is what we need to be exploring,

1438
01:30:20,210 --> 01:30:24,110
you know, to make our economy, you know,
we need to basically say, Oh, you know,

1439
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:28,310
let's figure out what kinds
of things become valuable.

1440
01:30:28,520 --> 01:30:31,910
As other thing has become commoditized
and let's start valuing them

1441
01:30:31,911 --> 01:30:32,744
appropriately.

1442
01:30:33,390 --> 01:30:34,223
Is,

1443
01:30:34,810 --> 01:30:38,530
is the decision to value
something appropriately?

1444
01:30:38,890 --> 01:30:42,070
What are some of the drivers of
that change? Potentially? I mean,

1445
01:30:42,071 --> 01:30:45,820
you have market demand, right?
So there could be, yeah, just a,

1446
01:30:45,821 --> 01:30:49,870
for instance you have an Uber or something
like that and all of a sudden this

1447
01:30:49,930 --> 01:30:54,930
access potential excess inventory
or idle time of resource x can be,

1448
01:30:55,840 --> 01:31:00,770
can be valued differently when people
devalue owning cars for instance. Uh,

1449
01:31:00,850 --> 01:31:05,850
you have regulatory rights in the case
of say Cha Child Labor you that you can

1450
01:31:06,341 --> 01:31:08,840
change the rules of the game so to speak.
So that the,

1451
01:31:09,130 --> 01:31:12,430
the incentives are different. What are,
what are some of the other drivers?

1452
01:31:12,490 --> 01:31:17,490
And are there any particular examples
of things that rich people are doing now

1453
01:31:19,451 --> 01:31:24,450
that you think are going
to be commonplace? Uh, and,

1454
01:31:24,460 --> 01:31:28,520
and much more widely adopted?
Yeah. Well, I mean, the thing

1455
01:31:29,340 --> 01:31:32,860
most rich people do that are,
you know,

1456
01:31:33,150 --> 01:31:36,630
could become a big driver of
the economy is experiences.

1457
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:40,960
You know what I mean? You know, you were
talking about, uh, you know, high cannon,

1458
01:31:40,970 --> 01:31:42,820
it was back to side with Kevin Kelly.
You know,

1459
01:31:42,821 --> 01:31:46,770
it's like most people don't get to do
things like that, you know, and uh, yeah.

1460
01:31:46,810 --> 01:31:51,280
But just the experience economy
writ large I think is, you know,

1461
01:31:51,281 --> 01:31:55,510
and that's everything from new kinds
of food, a new kinds of, you know,

1462
01:31:55,511 --> 01:31:58,000
I think we're going to have a lot
in augmented reality. You know,

1463
01:31:58,001 --> 01:32:02,410
there's already a lot in media. It's, it's
new kinds of experiences, you know, uh,

1464
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:06,610
you know, new kinds of learning, you
know, I mean, learning is a huge, I mean,

1465
01:32:07,090 --> 01:32:11,830
you know, it's like teaching people
to enjoy learning and, uh, uh, uh,

1466
01:32:12,010 --> 01:32:15,810
to always be, always be
learning new things. You know,
this is an economy in that.

1467
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:19,360
And, um, the, the, um,

1468
01:32:20,680 --> 01:32:21,900
the things that the,
the,

1469
01:32:21,910 --> 01:32:26,650
that I think policy wise that we need to
start thinking about is, first of all,

1470
01:32:26,980 --> 01:32:29,830
we have a lot of economic policies

1471
01:32:32,140 --> 01:32:34,840
that reward nonproductive investment.

1472
01:32:35,380 --> 01:32:37,360
What do we mean by non
productive investment?

1473
01:32:37,810 --> 01:32:42,810
It's sort of summed up pretty beautifully
in the tail of a Ge where Jeff EML was

1474
01:32:44,230 --> 01:32:48,870
in a recently forced out.
I mean, by all, I mean, you
know, Ge, so to say, oh no, no,

1475
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:51,200
he meant to retire. I
don't buy it. You know,

1476
01:32:51,240 --> 01:32:55,330
it was basically an activist
investor bought a stake in the firm,

1477
01:32:55,390 --> 01:32:59,250
started agitating for, you
know, share buybacks. Right?

1478
01:32:59,860 --> 01:33:04,570
And a among other things. I mean, you
know, and the, the thing is so amazing,

1479
01:33:04,571 --> 01:33:09,571
they wrote this white paper in 2015
and it describes in detail what a great

1480
01:33:11,591 --> 01:33:13,720
company Ge is.
You know,

1481
01:33:13,721 --> 01:33:16,870
they have bigger market share than
their competitors and these categories,

1482
01:33:16,871 --> 01:33:19,270
they're growing faster, they're
getting more focused, you know,

1483
01:33:19,271 --> 01:33:20,980
and it's like this amazing

1484
01:33:22,750 --> 01:33:27,750
story of how Ge succeeding in the real
economy and then they go buy this,

1485
01:33:27,791 --> 01:33:32,500
you know, but the stock prices lagged,
you know, we must fix the stock price

1486
01:33:34,090 --> 01:33:36,530
and the way that, you know, they
should do these various, you know,

1487
01:33:36,550 --> 01:33:39,400
things they need to spin this out in.
Some of those things might be rational,

1488
01:33:39,401 --> 01:33:44,070
but they should also borrow money.
And you know, basically, you know,

1489
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:47,590
when you buy back shares it tends to,
it reduces the number of shares.

1490
01:33:47,591 --> 01:33:51,820
So the earnings per share go up. And, and
think, since stocks are often, you know,

1491
01:33:52,250 --> 01:33:56,440
uh, prices, uh, as a multiple of
earnings per share, stock price goes up.

1492
01:33:56,470 --> 01:34:01,240
So Ge should borrow $20 billion
to make the stock price go up.

1493
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:05,200
Who benefit from that? Who benefits
from that? Ge doesn't need that.

1494
01:34:05,201 --> 01:34:08,650
Ges customers don't need
that investor's benefit. And,

1495
01:34:08,651 --> 01:34:10,930
and it turns out that at this point,

1496
01:34:11,320 --> 01:34:16,320
85% of all investment in
our economy is of this kind.

1497
01:34:18,700 --> 01:34:23,220
It's for the benefit of investors.
You know, we're, uh, um,

1498
01:34:23,560 --> 01:34:27,900
Warren Buffet, uh, put it really well in
this quote from, uh, Rhonda [inaudible],

1499
01:34:27,910 --> 01:34:29,500
Wonderful Book makers and takers,

1500
01:34:29,501 --> 01:34:34,480
which is all about this
other financialization of
the economy. And, uh, it,

1501
01:34:34,481 --> 01:34:37,300
uh, you know, he says, you
know, he told her, you know,

1502
01:34:37,301 --> 01:34:41,260
sometimes people prefer to go to
the casino, then the restaurant

1503
01:34:43,030 --> 01:34:46,810
and, you know, we have built an
economy that is largely a casino.

1504
01:34:46,870 --> 01:34:48,290
And this is why,
you know,

1505
01:34:48,340 --> 01:34:52,450
I think both Donald Trump and Bernie
Sanders played on this, you know,

1506
01:34:52,451 --> 01:34:56,980
and people know there's something wrong,
you know, and, and, and, you know,

1507
01:34:56,990 --> 01:35:01,070
our government has basically been
supportive of this paper economy.

1508
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:03,290
And they're wringing their hands.
But this,

1509
01:35:03,300 --> 01:35:07,060
this failed idea and this is kind of
brings me back to my book, which it,

1510
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:07,820
you know,

1511
01:35:07,820 --> 01:35:12,820
the title of which is WTF what's
the future and why it's up to us.

1512
01:35:13,400 --> 01:35:17,650
Yeah. And the why it's up to us is the,
is the, is the key part, because you know,

1513
01:35:17,660 --> 01:35:22,340
there's this sense of
technological determinism,
determinism, uh, you know, the,

1514
01:35:22,341 --> 01:35:25,370
that I revolt against,
you know,

1515
01:35:25,371 --> 01:35:29,600
this idea that technology
inevitably wants to eliminate jobs.

1516
01:35:30,050 --> 01:35:31,250
I believe,
you know,

1517
01:35:31,251 --> 01:35:36,251
the technology wants to solve new
problems and we have to ask ourselves,

1518
01:35:36,321 --> 01:35:39,680
what are the incentives that we've
created in our system. So, uh,

1519
01:35:39,681 --> 01:35:43,310
I want the book is really, in some
ways it's, it's a, it's a, an economic,

1520
01:35:43,330 --> 01:35:46,460
a polemic wrapped in a business
book wrapped in a memoir.

1521
01:35:46,910 --> 01:35:51,020
And a memoir starts with kind
of my experiences, uh, you know,

1522
01:35:51,140 --> 01:35:53,080
dealing with and thinking about,
you know,

1523
01:35:53,090 --> 01:35:57,530
the great platforms of the
computer industry, you know,
started with Microsoft. Uh,

1524
01:35:57,590 --> 01:36:02,570
and what I saw was that Microsoft took
too much of the value for themselves.

1525
01:36:02,770 --> 01:36:06,830
Uh, people deserted their ecosystem
and went elsewhere to the Internet.

1526
01:36:07,610 --> 01:36:11,300
And then I've watched this
story replay itself as you know,

1527
01:36:11,900 --> 01:36:15,800
Google and, uh, you know,
Facebook and Twitter and so on,

1528
01:36:15,801 --> 01:36:19,700
have competed with their
developer ecosystem and made
it less of a good place to

1529
01:36:19,701 --> 01:36:21,530
be. And, you know,

1530
01:36:22,340 --> 01:36:26,720
that lesson seems to be lost. And then
I of course, by extension I've seen, oh,

1531
01:36:26,721 --> 01:36:30,380
that's also how our financial markets,
which were originally designed as a,

1532
01:36:30,610 --> 01:36:34,250
as sort of an enabling platform
for the economy and for society.

1533
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:39,200
I've ended up trading against society
taking too much of the value for

1534
01:36:39,201 --> 01:36:40,034
themselves.

1535
01:36:40,340 --> 01:36:45,110
And so it's this sort of ecosystem
view of platforms and, and, and,

1536
01:36:45,180 --> 01:36:46,880
and, and, you know, and
actually also in the book,

1537
01:36:46,881 --> 01:36:50,800
it's kind of interesting
seeing how I, uh, uh, I,

1538
01:36:50,850 --> 01:36:54,350
I hate the books are slower than,
uh, you know, the, the modern media,

1539
01:36:54,380 --> 01:36:56,270
because I was kind of saying,
you know,

1540
01:36:56,330 --> 01:37:00,420
I kinda call it a little
bit on Lyft versus Uber, you
know, because I say, look,

1541
01:37:00,650 --> 01:37:03,800
they are creating more value
for their ecosystem of drivers.

1542
01:37:04,010 --> 01:37:07,520
And that really matters in the long
run. And sure enough, I mean, you know,

1543
01:37:07,850 --> 01:37:12,380
Lyft is really gaining on Uber because
Uber is extractive business model is sort

1544
01:37:12,381 --> 01:37:13,214
of caught up with them.

1545
01:37:14,750 --> 01:37:19,350
So as a question for you, I have so
many questions of course, but the uh,

1546
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:23,200
you have, and this is, this is
related I think to what you just said.

1547
01:37:23,201 --> 01:37:24,520
So you've built your,

1548
01:37:24,521 --> 01:37:29,521
you're somewhat of an anomaly in the
silicon valley area in the sense that you

1549
01:37:29,831 --> 01:37:32,800
build a profitable business with several
hundred millions of dollars in revenue

1550
01:37:32,801 --> 01:37:34,250
without any venture capital.

1551
01:37:35,190 --> 01:37:38,140
This slogan is what
I'd love to touch upon.

1552
01:37:38,141 --> 01:37:39,850
We can take this in any
direction you'd like,

1553
01:37:39,851 --> 01:37:44,790
but how did you come up with the slogan
and maybe you could give some backstory,

1554
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:46,750
create more value than you capture.

1555
01:37:47,160 --> 01:37:49,880
Ah, that's actually Brian Erwin again. Um,

1556
01:37:50,780 --> 01:37:52,850
I just want his last gift of the company.

1557
01:37:52,851 --> 01:37:57,360
We had a management retreat in
2000 and I think I told the story,

1558
01:37:57,361 --> 01:38:01,280
I won't mention the name, but as you
more, more than one answer, I said, yeah,

1559
01:38:01,320 --> 01:38:05,520
more than one internet billionaire
has told me that they got started. Uh,

1560
01:38:05,550 --> 01:38:08,750
you know, with, you know, their,
their whole business with yeah.

1561
01:38:08,770 --> 01:38:13,710
What they learned from an
O'Reilly book. Yeah. And, uh,
Brian laughing, he said, yeah,

1562
01:38:13,711 --> 01:38:16,410
that should be our slogan.
We create more value than we capture.

1563
01:38:18,940 --> 01:38:21,450
So it came up and it,

1564
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:23,470
of course, we all went, yes. You know,

1565
01:38:25,200 --> 01:38:30,030
why is that, uh, that you've
had, as I understand it,

1566
01:38:30,031 --> 01:38:34,920
discussions with Eric
Schmidt about don't be evil,

1567
01:38:35,310 --> 01:38:39,420
uh, Google slogan. What do you,
what do you think of that slogan?

1568
01:38:39,421 --> 01:38:40,740
Is that sufficient?
Is it,

1569
01:38:40,970 --> 01:38:45,830
well, the thing that, you know, I,
the problem I have, and, and the, the,

1570
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:47,330
again, I mean, this was a, you know,

1571
01:38:47,450 --> 01:38:50,360
we were at Google Zeitgeist and we
had a conversation in the lobby.

1572
01:38:50,600 --> 01:38:54,740
It wasn't like we had this profound,
you know, the, uh, you know,

1573
01:38:54,741 --> 01:38:59,120
but I was trying to say, look,
don't be evil, isn't measurable,

1574
01:38:59,850 --> 01:39:04,690
you know, create more value than
you capture is measurable. And, uh,

1575
01:39:04,730 --> 01:39:07,460
you know, and, and it is,
and again, I, you know, I,

1576
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:12,410
I'll expand on this quite
a bit on my book. You know,
the, this idea of, you know,

1577
01:39:12,411 --> 01:39:17,411
when you have a system where there's
a platform or an economic system that

1578
01:39:17,631 --> 01:39:20,160
creates more value or an RN,
an ecosystem,

1579
01:39:20,161 --> 01:39:23,580
this kind of goes back to Frank Herbert
and what I learned from him. Uh,

1580
01:39:23,720 --> 01:39:24,890
when you have an ecosystem,

1581
01:39:24,891 --> 01:39:29,891
it has to actually create value
for all its participants and,

1582
01:39:30,740 --> 01:39:32,240
and you have to be able to measure that.

1583
01:39:32,270 --> 01:39:36,350
And we need to actually start
thinking about as a society,

1584
01:39:36,351 --> 01:39:41,351
how we measure more holistically
the ecosystem value against created.

1585
01:39:41,480 --> 01:39:46,480
Because what we've done is we've created
a set of measures that are focused

1586
01:39:47,031 --> 01:39:51,140
exclusively on one set of,
of market participants,

1587
01:39:51,141 --> 01:39:54,950
which is really the market owners. You
know, if you think about, you know,

1588
01:39:55,220 --> 01:39:56,690
what the stock market is about,

1589
01:39:56,691 --> 01:40:00,260
it's about the people who
own the systems to companies.

1590
01:40:00,710 --> 01:40:05,700
And we've just, you know, we've sort
of forgotten that, you know, the,

1591
01:40:05,701 --> 01:40:10,701
the financial markets are a map of our
expectations of what's supposed to be

1592
01:40:11,151 --> 01:40:12,650
happening in the real economy.

1593
01:40:13,250 --> 01:40:17,450
And instead we're just kind
of manipulating the map
and, and kind of go, well,

1594
01:40:17,510 --> 01:40:18,440
you know, let, you know,

1595
01:40:18,530 --> 01:40:21,950
and hoping nobody notices that the real
economy is going to shit, you know,

1596
01:40:21,951 --> 01:40:26,450
while we're telling ourselves
this great story. And, and, uh,

1597
01:40:26,630 --> 01:40:30,560
I think that the, you know,
figuring out, you know,

1598
01:40:30,561 --> 01:40:34,360
are there other measures, you
know, we, uh, you know, uh,

1599
01:40:34,450 --> 01:40:37,820
Clay Christiansen's also written about
this, you know, he's, uh, you know, uh,

1600
01:40:37,821 --> 01:40:40,970
the author of the, the original,
his original book was, you know,

1601
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:44,810
the capitalist dilemma. Uh, I'm
sorry, not the capitalist dilemma,

1602
01:40:44,811 --> 01:40:48,290
the innovator's dilemma, but
he has a, uh, a paper he wrote,

1603
01:40:48,291 --> 01:40:50,900
and I believe that maybe a book
now called the capitalist dilemma,

1604
01:40:50,930 --> 01:40:55,930
which is really about this question of
we started measuring the wrong things

1605
01:40:57,220 --> 01:41:00,260
and, you know, effectively we
started measuring, you know,

1606
01:41:00,310 --> 01:41:04,150
a small subset of the things we ought
to be measuring about the health of the

1607
01:41:04,151 --> 01:41:04,984
economy.

1608
01:41:05,500 --> 01:41:09,310
So what, uh, and maybe
this is related, maybe not.

1609
01:41:09,340 --> 01:41:11,200
So feel free to tackle
this in whichever order.

1610
01:41:11,201 --> 01:41:16,060
So I guess what I would love to ask is,
what should we measure? But you, uh,

1611
01:41:16,150 --> 01:41:16,451
I've,

1612
01:41:16,451 --> 01:41:21,451
I've read that you think the financial
markets might well be the first rogue AI.

1613
01:41:22,150 --> 01:41:26,950
Uh, it's so if, why, why do you feel
that way and what should we do about it?

1614
01:41:26,951 --> 01:41:29,180
And maybe that relates to the
measurement. I Dunno. Yeah.

1615
01:41:29,500 --> 01:41:32,700
Yeah. Well, I mean, I
guess the thing that I, uh,

1616
01:41:33,550 --> 01:41:36,250
this is sort of an extended
metaphor at the core of the book.

1617
01:41:36,251 --> 01:41:39,370
I'm trying to sort of explain
what I learned from platforms.

1618
01:41:39,371 --> 01:41:41,290
And so I kind of look at,
for example,

1619
01:41:41,350 --> 01:41:46,350
at a Google and the way
they manage search quality.

1620
01:41:46,631 --> 01:41:50,020
And you kind of understand that even
though they have this, you know,

1621
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:54,700
Cornucopia of, of algorithms,
including, you know, AI

1622
01:41:56,350 --> 01:42:00,010
is all about serving a master
fitness function. You know, the,

1623
01:42:00,011 --> 01:42:03,820
the thing that they're trying to optimize
towards in this case is relevance.

1624
01:42:03,821 --> 01:42:06,820
Whether it's the relevance of a search
result or the relevance of an ad.

1625
01:42:08,110 --> 01:42:09,940
And, uh, you know,

1626
01:42:10,430 --> 01:42:14,500
and it's this constant battle against
bad actors against new inch. You know,

1627
01:42:14,820 --> 01:42:16,510
you're trying to deal
with new information,

1628
01:42:16,660 --> 01:42:18,970
but you're always trying to
optimize towards that goal.

1629
01:42:19,300 --> 01:42:24,190
So then I look at Facebook and gang, okay.
So we see that they have, uh, a related,

1630
01:42:24,870 --> 01:42:27,400
but somewhat different fitness function.
You know,

1631
01:42:27,410 --> 01:42:31,870
Google's fitness function is we serve
you something out and then you go away,

1632
01:42:31,871 --> 01:42:35,760
right? Because you, if you've
got the real answer, you,

1633
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:37,690
you went away,
right?

1634
01:42:37,720 --> 01:42:41,590
Whereas Facebook's is if we give you the
thing that we really want you to get,

1635
01:42:41,680 --> 01:42:45,940
you come back and you spend more time,
right? So it's almost an inverse.

1636
01:42:46,240 --> 01:42:49,980
But again, they still have this master
fitness function. There's is, you know,

1637
01:42:49,990 --> 01:42:52,120
you could describe it as engagement and,

1638
01:42:52,150 --> 01:42:56,170
and I kind of talked through fake
news and how you can see how a fitness

1639
01:42:56,171 --> 01:43:00,820
function can lead you astray. And how
mark right now is sort of saying, oh,

1640
01:43:00,821 --> 01:43:04,900
wait, you know, the things
we told our computer to do,

1641
01:43:05,560 --> 01:43:08,260
our system or not,
what we really meant.

1642
01:43:08,680 --> 01:43:12,430
And actually this is a couple of quotes
that I can't believe they've sort of

1643
01:43:12,431 --> 01:43:13,560
been life quotes from me.

1644
01:43:13,560 --> 01:43:16,920
And I can't believe that I did not
actually put them in the book. Uh,

1645
01:43:17,230 --> 01:43:21,430
one of them was, there's a great quote
from Walt Mossberg, uh, uh, you know,

1646
01:43:21,431 --> 01:43:25,090
the famous tech journalists to
once said to me years ago, he said,

1647
01:43:25,091 --> 01:43:28,840
I told Steve bomber, he said, if you
guys could just dial back to the greed,

1648
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:33,400
only 5%, you know, people
would like you 100% more.

1649
01:43:34,420 --> 01:43:39,130
Yeah. And, and, uh, or people
wouldn't hate you. And, and,
and the other one was this,

1650
01:43:39,150 --> 01:43:41,330
uh, you know, quote about debugging, uh,

1651
01:43:41,440 --> 01:43:45,010
from a guy named Andrew Singer who was
a friend of mine who I hadn't seen for

1652
01:43:45,011 --> 01:43:47,830
many, many years. But if
he wants said to me, said,

1653
01:43:48,090 --> 01:43:53,090
debugging is the art of finding out
what you really told your computer to do

1654
01:43:53,420 --> 01:43:55,430
instead of what you
thought you told it to do.

1655
01:43:57,080 --> 01:44:01,400
So in some sense, so
like right now, you know,

1656
01:44:02,180 --> 01:44:05,810
mark is trying to debug the,
you know,

1657
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:10,640
the fitness functions of Facebook's
engagement paradigm, you know,

1658
01:44:10,641 --> 01:44:13,100
so that be, you know, he's, we're
talking about real communities.

1659
01:44:13,100 --> 01:44:16,640
How do we support more real communities
of interest as opposed to these sort of

1660
01:44:16,910 --> 01:44:21,290
fake manipulative, you know, communities
that are contributing to polarization.

1661
01:44:21,560 --> 01:44:25,610
But when you look at our financial
markets, we have that same challenge.

1662
01:44:25,611 --> 01:44:27,740
We have a master fitness function.
You know,

1663
01:44:27,741 --> 01:44:32,741
and it's sort of interesting to realize
that the master fitness function that we

1664
01:44:32,931 --> 01:44:36,870
had after World War II and
that golden period when, uh,

1665
01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:40,310
of the growing middle class
was actually full employment.

1666
01:44:40,940 --> 01:44:45,590
They were scared shitless because after
World War One, all those, you know, they,

1667
01:44:45,591 --> 01:44:48,770
they'd seen first of all in America,
you know, you had, you know,

1668
01:44:48,771 --> 01:44:53,280
all the returning soldiers who were,
you know, you know, homeless, you know,

1669
01:44:53,590 --> 01:44:56,180
whatever you, all of this had
led to the Great Depression.

1670
01:44:56,360 --> 01:44:58,850
We saw all of this stuff. I mean, it
wasn't just the returning soldiers,

1671
01:44:58,851 --> 01:45:03,260
but it was, they went into this period
where people were out of work and, uh,

1672
01:45:03,290 --> 01:45:05,150
you know, they see, so
what happened in, you know,

1673
01:45:05,151 --> 01:45:08,870
the rise of Nazis in Germany and they
were really focused on putting people to

1674
01:45:08,871 --> 01:45:12,980
work, you know, and that was all of the
policy interventions. Where around that.

1675
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:16,970
And then in the, you know, the seventies
and eighties, it really, you know,

1676
01:45:16,971 --> 01:45:20,800
we kind of shifted the, the fitness
function to shareholder value and,

1677
01:45:20,820 --> 01:45:23,580
and you know, kind of if the, if
it was good for the stock market,

1678
01:45:23,581 --> 01:45:27,530
it was good for America. And now we're
kind of looking at it and going, oh,

1679
01:45:27,710 --> 01:45:31,160
that didn't work. And you
know, in some sense, you know,

1680
01:45:31,670 --> 01:45:34,220
kind of what I'm trying to lay out
the challenge in the book. I'm trying,

1681
01:45:34,221 --> 01:45:37,250
you know, there's a lot of
people are saying this, you
know, I mean the economists,

1682
01:45:37,430 --> 01:45:41,000
you know, politicians, whatever, I'm
just trying to make the, you know,

1683
01:45:41,300 --> 01:45:44,780
another line of argument reasoning
from tech and what we learned from tech

1684
01:45:44,781 --> 01:45:47,510
platforms. You know,
the, in a similar way,

1685
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:52,600
we have to look at what are we telling
our economy to optimize for and realizing

1686
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:56,390
that we make choices in that,
you know, the, the economy,

1687
01:45:56,570 --> 01:46:00,980
despite all of the ideas of that,
it's a free market.

1688
01:46:00,980 --> 01:46:05,030
It isn't at all. It's a design
system and it has all kinds of rules.

1689
01:46:05,031 --> 01:46:08,950
Just like Google has all kinds
of rules for, uh, you know,

1690
01:46:09,080 --> 01:46:10,460
achieving relevance.

1691
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:15,880
We have all kinds of rules in our economy
that bias it towards the outcomes that

1692
01:46:16,371 --> 01:46:19,040
we're optimizing for. Namely
shareholder value. You know,

1693
01:46:19,041 --> 01:46:23,300
we have tax preferences around
capital gains versus how we tax labor.

1694
01:46:23,480 --> 01:46:28,390
We have rules about whether people can
organize. I mean, you know, you know,

1695
01:46:28,550 --> 01:46:30,130
it's no accident that,
you know,

1696
01:46:30,140 --> 01:46:34,550
labor got a bigger share of the pie
when labor organizing was supported as

1697
01:46:34,551 --> 01:46:38,480
opposed to when it's not, you know, and
a lot of things went wrong with unions,

1698
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:41,840
you know, and, and that has to
be debugged to, uh, you know,

1699
01:46:41,841 --> 01:46:46,220
we have to rediscover what it means
for people to be able to stand up to,

1700
01:46:46,250 --> 01:46:50,820
you know, the, the, the machines
that we built. Um, you know,

1701
01:46:50,821 --> 01:46:55,110
there's no rules about how much people
work, how much time off they get.

1702
01:46:55,111 --> 01:46:57,240
And you can see there's
different, you know, like,

1703
01:46:57,241 --> 01:46:59,850
just look at German stakeholder
capitalism and go, oh,

1704
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:03,630
here's a different system with different
rules as different outcomes. Uh,

1705
01:47:03,650 --> 01:47:07,910
you know, look at, uh, um, you know,
the interventionists, uh, you know,

1706
01:47:07,920 --> 01:47:11,790
evolution of the economy and countries
like South Korea and you kind of go, yeah,

1707
01:47:11,791 --> 01:47:14,100
this whole free market thing is just,

1708
01:47:15,780 --> 01:47:19,970
it's a map and it's not entirely,
it's got some great stuff in it.

1709
01:47:21,020 --> 01:47:24,180
It's just not the whole picture. You
know, again, it goes back to Chris Escape.

1710
01:47:24,200 --> 01:47:25,730
The map is not the territory.

1711
01:47:26,090 --> 01:47:30,470
So we have to constantly check
our map and ask ourselves,

1712
01:47:30,770 --> 01:47:32,570
are we optimizing for the right things?

1713
01:47:32,810 --> 01:47:37,810
What rules should we be changing in
order to get a closer to the outcome we

1714
01:47:37,971 --> 01:47:42,770
really want. And of course we have to
agree on that outcome. But I think we, we,

1715
01:47:42,771 --> 01:47:46,430
if we want, if we want a human
centered future, you know,

1716
01:47:46,760 --> 01:47:51,020
we can choose that. And again, I
kind of ends, I think, uh, you know,

1717
01:47:51,080 --> 01:47:53,480
an optimistic note kind of
looking at the ways that,

1718
01:47:53,650 --> 01:47:56,420
that people are choosing
that. And they are, you know,

1719
01:47:56,421 --> 01:48:00,890
reaching for that better future, working
on hard problems, you know, doing,

1720
01:48:00,920 --> 01:48:01,680
you know,
you know,

1721
01:48:01,680 --> 01:48:05,390
inventing new forms of creativity that
other people are willing to pay for.

1722
01:48:05,620 --> 01:48:09,860
A and building that wonderful fiction
that we have on now we're back to poetry.

1723
01:48:09,861 --> 01:48:14,210
You know, Wallace Stevens had
this amazing idea, uh, that, uh,

1724
01:48:14,600 --> 01:48:18,770
you know, the reality is, is actually a
fiction that we create for each other.

1725
01:48:21,040 --> 01:48:25,930
That boy, yeah, I mean reality in
quotation marks or not. Uh, it seems,

1726
01:48:25,990 --> 01:48:29,470
seems to be, certainly seems
to be that case. I, yeah.

1727
01:48:29,710 --> 01:48:32,510
Yeah.
His great line is reality is an activity.

1728
01:48:32,511 --> 01:48:34,340
It was the most August imagination.

1729
01:48:35,310 --> 01:48:40,310
So one thing that I really love about
both reading your work and just speaking

1730
01:48:41,541 --> 01:48:46,370
with you is how much the new,
uh,

1731
01:48:46,430 --> 01:48:50,060
relates to the very, very old and
vice versa. And what you mean by that,

1732
01:48:50,210 --> 01:48:53,780
we're even reminds us to reexamine base
assumptions. So for instance, I mean,

1733
01:48:53,781 --> 01:48:54,710
if we look at,

1734
01:48:55,520 --> 01:49:00,290
we could look at the fanciest of high
frequency trading or even some disasters

1735
01:49:00,291 --> 01:49:04,490
like longterm capital management
to see how these, uh, uh,

1736
01:49:04,600 --> 01:49:07,400
systems and humans respond to incentives.

1737
01:49:07,401 --> 01:49:10,370
And if you don't look at
them closely enough, the
debugging process can be super,

1738
01:49:10,371 --> 01:49:11,570
super painful.
Uh,

1739
01:49:11,680 --> 01:49:16,680
or how cryptocurrency has made people
take a closer look if they dig in at what

1740
01:49:17,691 --> 01:49:19,130
money actually represents.

1741
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:24,760
And so I wanted to ask you a
question about money and not on a,

1742
01:49:26,690 --> 01:49:31,310
on a macroeconomic level, but,
uh, on, on a smaller scale.

1743
01:49:31,690 --> 01:49:34,850
And this is a quote, correct me
if I'm getting this wrong, uh,

1744
01:49:35,340 --> 01:49:39,350
in this quote, uh, money in a
business is like gas in your car.

1745
01:49:39,350 --> 01:49:43,790
You don't want to run out, but you're not
doing a tour of gas stations. I'm sorry.

1746
01:49:43,850 --> 01:49:45,890
Yeah. So can you, can
you elaborate on that?

1747
01:49:45,891 --> 01:49:48,570
Because there are people certainly
who disagree, right? They would,

1748
01:49:48,580 --> 01:49:51,520
or they would not say that life
should be a tour of gas stations,

1749
01:49:51,521 --> 01:49:55,150
but they would assert that maybe the
function of business is to generate a

1750
01:49:55,151 --> 01:49:59,140
profit and at that as much
profit as is humanly possible.

1751
01:49:59,560 --> 01:50:04,090
Can you explain, uh, that position and,

1752
01:50:05,110 --> 01:50:07,840
well, I mean, I, and, and
also, sorry, not to interrupt,

1753
01:50:07,841 --> 01:50:12,670
but also talk a little bit about,
you know, a lot of very, very,

1754
01:50:12,671 --> 01:50:15,250
very wealthy people,
uh,

1755
01:50:15,251 --> 01:50:19,480
in tech who have in some cases
come from very meager backgrounds.

1756
01:50:19,481 --> 01:50:22,640
I'd love to also hear about the,

1757
01:50:22,930 --> 01:50:27,250
the mistakes that you see in your
mind as it comes to personal,

1758
01:50:27,251 --> 01:50:31,630
in a personal or familial level
relating to money or dealing with money.

1759
01:50:32,570 --> 01:50:33,950
I mean,
my own mistakes.

1760
01:50:34,080 --> 01:50:36,300
Uh, no, just, well, I think you,

1761
01:50:36,510 --> 01:50:41,280
you appear to have a very
healthy relationship with
this concept of money and

1762
01:50:41,281 --> 01:50:43,680
money in general. Uh, but I'm,

1763
01:50:44,610 --> 01:50:48,660
I'm wondering what we can come back to
that. Why don't we, where do we start?

1764
01:50:48,661 --> 01:50:50,250
I'm asking you like seven
questions in one, but,

1765
01:50:50,480 --> 01:50:54,980
well, let me, let me, I guess I would just
say to say a couple of things. One is,

1766
01:50:55,490 --> 01:50:56,060
uh,

1767
01:50:56,060 --> 01:51:00,800
anybody who thinks that
money is the object,

1768
01:51:02,200 --> 01:51:03,033
uh,

1769
01:51:03,510 --> 01:51:04,620
you know,
is,

1770
01:51:05,160 --> 01:51:09,210
I'm sad for them because money is a tool.

1771
01:51:10,010 --> 01:51:10,570
Yeah.

1772
01:51:10,570 --> 01:51:12,970
You know what I mean? It,
you know, we want happiness,

1773
01:51:12,971 --> 01:51:16,870
we want happiness for ourselves, we want
it for the people we love. And if we're,

1774
01:51:17,170 --> 01:51:20,470
you know, great soul, we want
it for everybody, you know,

1775
01:51:20,471 --> 01:51:24,700
and we should want it for everybody.
You know, I mean, and you know,

1776
01:51:24,910 --> 01:51:27,730
the idea, you know, there is sort of a,

1777
01:51:27,940 --> 01:51:32,620
I think a legitimate debate
about the right way to do that.

1778
01:51:32,621 --> 01:51:35,600
And so, you know, when, when, you
know, a lot of people, they were like,

1779
01:51:35,650 --> 01:51:38,050
we were talking with Russ
Roberts, uh, you know,

1780
01:51:38,051 --> 01:51:42,460
who's is a dedicated in a libertarian
free market, or is this kind of,

1781
01:51:42,461 --> 01:51:45,970
if you've seen his little film, it's
a wonderful loaf about, you know,

1782
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:49,960
kind of Adam Smith and his book, how Adam
Smith's can change your life. You know,

1783
01:51:49,961 --> 01:51:52,000
these are all kind of,
you know,

1784
01:51:52,570 --> 01:51:56,800
an encomium to this idea
that there's this magic when,

1785
01:51:57,460 --> 01:51:58,293
mmm.

1786
01:51:59,730 --> 01:52:04,680
You know, people just pursue their own
aims and it magically produces, uh,

1787
01:52:04,740 --> 01:52:09,150
th this wonderful goodness of
the economy. And I, you know,

1788
01:52:09,480 --> 01:52:12,360
but those people are not pursuing money,

1789
01:52:14,330 --> 01:52:18,430
you know, money is a measure
what they are pursuing.

1790
01:52:19,450 --> 01:52:23,920
And so I guess, so that's the
first piece that I would say. And,

1791
01:52:24,100 --> 01:52:25,690
and then the, the, you
know, there's sort of,

1792
01:52:25,720 --> 01:52:29,620
obviously there's lots and lots of studies
that, you know, above a certain level,

1793
01:52:29,621 --> 01:52:33,730
more money doesn't make you
happier, you know, and, um,

1794
01:52:34,330 --> 01:52:39,100
you know, the, the, uh, I think that, uh,

1795
01:52:39,440 --> 01:52:42,280
you know, in general, uh, you know,

1796
01:52:42,340 --> 01:52:47,200
happy and prosperous societies
are more egalitarian, you know,

1797
01:52:47,220 --> 01:52:52,040
I mean, not, you know, I, you
know, it's not flat. You know
what I mean? I don't think,

1798
01:52:52,070 --> 01:52:55,960
uh, uh, you know, sort of
interesting because a lot of
people kind of go, well, it,

1799
01:52:55,961 --> 01:53:00,820
it, it, you know, if people aren't
allowed to become as rich as,

1800
01:53:00,830 --> 01:53:05,570
as you know, inhumanly
possible, uh, then the,

1801
01:53:05,571 --> 01:53:08,720
you know, your, your, your sort
of somehow cutting off, uh,

1802
01:53:08,830 --> 01:53:11,600
this sort of capitalist impulse.
I go, that's not true. I mean,

1803
01:53:11,601 --> 01:53:14,310
I just look in my own history.
Yeah.

1804
01:53:14,330 --> 01:53:19,010
And I think about the people who
drove the industry, uh, you know,

1805
01:53:19,011 --> 01:53:24,011
when I was young and what
their expectations were
about how much money they

1806
01:53:24,321 --> 01:53:28,940
would make. You know, and
I think of titans of the
industry, people like, you know,

1807
01:53:29,300 --> 01:53:33,980
uh, you know, pupil and Packard or you
know, uh, Gordon Moore and you know,

1808
01:53:34,160 --> 01:53:35,590
Andy Grove.
And,

1809
01:53:36,230 --> 01:53:41,230
and they probably made less money than
some punk kid who built and sold a

1810
01:53:42,021 --> 01:53:45,020
startup that basically vanished
as soon as it was sold.

1811
01:53:46,920 --> 01:53:51,540
You know, I mean, we have people who
are billionaires who created very, very,

1812
01:53:51,541 --> 01:53:53,500
very little value,
you know,

1813
01:53:53,550 --> 01:53:58,020
and yet we have somehow upped our,
um,

1814
01:54:00,360 --> 01:54:04,430
you know, uh, you know, so our
standard of, you know, what it means,

1815
01:54:04,431 --> 01:54:07,870
it was that great scene in
the, in the, uh, you know, uh,

1816
01:54:07,871 --> 01:54:11,890
the social network in the movie, and it
was like $1 million is a cool, you know,

1817
01:54:11,950 --> 01:54:15,610
now $1 billion now. That's cool.
It was just like this vanity,

1818
01:54:16,650 --> 01:54:17,870
you know, that's, you know,

1819
01:54:17,890 --> 01:54:22,180
vanity and I just kind of feel what we,

1820
01:54:23,650 --> 01:54:27,070
you know, uh, you know, anyway, I mean,

1821
01:54:27,071 --> 01:54:31,300
I guess I would say there's sort of a
social, a set of social issues where,

1822
01:54:31,690 --> 01:54:31,901
you know,

1823
01:54:31,901 --> 01:54:36,901
self interest should tell you that if
we don't build a more just and equitable

1824
01:54:40,301 --> 01:54:44,440
society, you know, this system
is going to fall down. You know,

1825
01:54:44,470 --> 01:54:49,470
there are people in North Korea who
are doing very well for themselves.

1826
01:54:50,860 --> 01:54:55,410
There are people in Venezuela who are
doing very well for themselves, all right.

1827
01:54:55,450 --> 01:55:00,400
But the vast majority of
people are living very badly,

1828
01:55:00,940 --> 01:55:02,620
and that's a failed state.

1829
01:55:03,220 --> 01:55:07,960
And that's the end game of an
economy in which, you know,

1830
01:55:08,020 --> 01:55:12,490
this, this ferocious competition of
some people to get as much as possible.

1831
01:55:13,420 --> 01:55:16,300
And, uh, I think, you know,

1832
01:55:16,360 --> 01:55:21,360
the goal for all of us should be to
create as much value as possible and to

1833
01:55:22,361 --> 01:55:27,130
capture enough of it, but
not all of it. And, um,

1834
01:55:27,460 --> 01:55:31,600
you know, and I, I do think
that if you see a, you know,

1835
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:34,180
there's a lot of wonderful,
I mean,

1836
01:55:34,181 --> 01:55:38,640
one of the things that I do feel like is
wonderful about silicon valley is there

1837
01:55:38,710 --> 01:55:42,790
a lot of people who say,
yeah, that's enough.

1838
01:55:43,770 --> 01:55:47,280
I want to go, you know, do
something really valuable. You know,

1839
01:55:47,281 --> 01:55:50,370
we've tapped into this with code for
America in the United States digital

1840
01:55:50,371 --> 01:55:52,950
service. You know, people who are saying,
okay, I'm going to go to government,

1841
01:55:53,340 --> 01:55:57,180
you know, uh, or we see
in, in, uh, uh, you know,

1842
01:55:57,181 --> 01:56:00,710
someone like Jeff Hoover at grail
know this is okay. You know,

1843
01:56:00,750 --> 01:56:04,110
I'm going to try to develop an early
detection test for cancer. You know,

1844
01:56:04,230 --> 01:56:07,730
it's like, I don't need,
you know, to go, you know,

1845
01:56:08,040 --> 01:56:10,920
make another startup is going
to make a whole bunch of money.

1846
01:56:10,950 --> 01:56:13,920
Maybe he will make a whole bunch of money,
but that's not what he's doing.

1847
01:56:14,140 --> 01:56:17,940
Or Elon Musk, what a great example. I
mean, you all put his own money at risk,

1848
01:56:17,941 --> 01:56:20,280
you know, you know, a lot of
it, you know, kinda going,

1849
01:56:20,840 --> 01:56:22,470
I want to do something really hard.

1850
01:56:22,471 --> 01:56:25,110
That's going to really move the
needle about making a better world.

1851
01:56:25,111 --> 01:56:29,340
And he's done it again and
again. You know, whether right
or wrong about, you know,

1852
01:56:29,341 --> 01:56:33,260
we need to become a multiplanetary
species. I think he's right. Uh,

1853
01:56:33,280 --> 01:56:35,680
other people go, oh, we should be
spending their money here on earth.

1854
01:56:35,880 --> 01:56:39,090
He's basically, you know, doing something.

1855
01:56:39,091 --> 01:56:42,240
He's harnessing this
machine of the economy.

1856
01:56:42,240 --> 01:56:47,240
There's a wonderful machine of capital
to do something to do something,

1857
01:56:48,090 --> 01:56:49,380
you know, and uh, you know,

1858
01:56:49,381 --> 01:56:53,700
it's like he's become rich as a byproduct
of what he's trying to accomplish,

1859
01:56:53,701 --> 01:56:57,600
which is exactly what I mean by you're
not doing a tour of gas stations.

1860
01:56:57,720 --> 01:57:01,490
Meanwhile, there are people,
you know, like those people
on Wall Street, you know,

1861
01:57:01,560 --> 01:57:05,250
leading up to 2000,
they knew they weren't creating value.

1862
01:57:06,060 --> 01:57:10,020
They were simply trying to extract it.
They were doing a tour of gas stations.

1863
01:57:10,830 --> 01:57:15,450
And I have to say there are
too many people in Silicon
valley who are like that.

1864
01:57:15,660 --> 01:57:18,140
You know,
sort of funny because I feel like we,

1865
01:57:18,190 --> 01:57:23,190
we call people in Silicon
Valley entrepreneurs and yes,

1866
01:57:23,340 --> 01:57:25,410
there are silicon valley entrepreneurs,

1867
01:57:25,680 --> 01:57:29,520
but they're also a lot of people
who I think are a lot closer.

1868
01:57:29,610 --> 01:57:31,830
If you kind of try to draw the right map,

1869
01:57:32,460 --> 01:57:37,170
there were a lot closer to actors
than they are to entrepreneurs.

1870
01:57:37,800 --> 01:57:42,480
That is, they're going around looking
for a project to attach themselves to,

1871
01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:46,470
which is funded by, you know,
it's like substitute, you know,

1872
01:57:46,620 --> 01:57:50,070
venture capitalists for movie studio.
Right.

1873
01:57:51,060 --> 01:57:53,850
And you could say, yeah, an actor's
and entrepreneur. Yeah. I mean they're,

1874
01:57:53,851 --> 01:57:55,710
they're basically, you know,
they have their, you know,

1875
01:57:55,711 --> 01:57:57,240
they're driving their own career,

1876
01:57:57,300 --> 01:58:00,540
but they're basically waiting for somebody
to give them money to do this thing,

1877
01:58:00,930 --> 01:58:02,820
you know,
and if they don't get the money,

1878
01:58:02,880 --> 01:58:07,880
so they really kind of a special
kind of hired employee and uh,

1879
01:58:08,071 --> 01:58:12,000
you know, and that's kind of what, what
we're doing with our, our venture firm.

1880
01:58:12,360 --> 01:58:16,020
My partner, Bryce Roberts has really
kicked off this thing called indievc,

1881
01:58:16,021 --> 01:58:19,050
which is really about how do you
build real businesses, you know? Yeah.

1882
01:58:19,051 --> 01:58:20,610
You might need some money to get started,

1883
01:58:20,611 --> 01:58:24,060
but mainly you want to get
funded by customers, you know,

1884
01:58:24,061 --> 01:58:26,940
because I've see all these people in
Silicon Valley and they basically go from

1885
01:58:26,941 --> 01:58:29,250
failed startup to fail, start
off, just like, you know,

1886
01:58:29,251 --> 01:58:31,260
an actor goes from one movie to another.

1887
01:58:33,870 --> 01:58:37,380
You seem to be so forward looking

1888
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:42,190
and so,
so often at the lead edge

1889
01:58:42,310 --> 01:58:45,640
of, uh, various, uh,

1890
01:58:45,820 --> 01:58:50,770
trends and changes that become something
seemingly obvious in hindsight.

1891
01:58:50,771 --> 01:58:55,180
Right? I mean, you're just, you're, you're
so a forward looking in so many ways.

1892
01:58:55,240 --> 01:58:57,100
I promised I would come back to this.

1893
01:58:57,910 --> 01:59:00,850
Why do you read old bestsellers
from generations ago?

1894
01:59:01,460 --> 01:59:03,950
Well, I mean, really just for fun.

1895
01:59:07,070 --> 01:59:11,720
How do you pick them and that if
that's the goal, it has really, again,

1896
01:59:11,721 --> 01:59:15,470
one of these pattern recognition things.
I mean, I first became conscious of it.

1897
01:59:15,860 --> 01:59:17,180
Uh,
this would be,

1898
01:59:17,690 --> 01:59:22,690
must have been maybe
close on 30 years ago.

1899
01:59:23,660 --> 01:59:28,130
Uh, I dropped my daughter off at a
doctor's appointment and I was, I was,

1900
01:59:28,190 --> 01:59:32,450
I went for a walk while she
was, you know, kind of, uh, uh,

1901
01:59:32,780 --> 01:59:35,720
actually maybe I had just gone back to
the car and it was starting to rain.

1902
01:59:35,721 --> 01:59:39,380
And I walked by this bookstore that was
going out of business and they had put

1903
01:59:39,381 --> 01:59:44,270
all these books out on the street and
it was a box and it started to rain.

1904
01:59:44,300 --> 01:59:48,680
And I see it was like a box of Zane grey
books and I still riders of the Purple

1905
01:59:48,680 --> 01:59:51,530
Sage. And I thought,
I've heard of that. Yeah.

1906
01:59:51,531 --> 01:59:54,410
And I couldn't bear it to see the
books get rained on. So I said,

1907
01:59:54,420 --> 01:59:57,140
I'm just going to pick them up,
put in my car and you know,

1908
01:59:57,141 --> 01:59:59,010
and I'll give him away
somewhere else later. And I,

1909
01:59:59,120 --> 02:00:02,420
but I pulled that book out and I read
it and I loved it, you know, and I,

1910
02:00:02,450 --> 02:00:04,190
cause it's, it's this
sort of like, oh my God,

1911
02:00:04,191 --> 02:00:07,730
this guy kind of invented the
mythology of the old west, you know.

1912
02:00:07,731 --> 02:00:11,780
And I read a bunch of the others and
grade books that were in there. And, uh,

1913
02:00:11,781 --> 02:00:14,810
that was kind of, I first started to
go, oh, there's something interesting,

1914
02:00:14,840 --> 02:00:18,110
you know, these, yeah, sure.
There's still, they're still
popular in a certain way,

1915
02:00:18,250 --> 02:00:19,610
but then they're super dated,

1916
02:00:20,300 --> 02:00:23,990
but they're like a time machine into a,
you know,

1917
02:00:24,680 --> 02:00:28,640
how people felt, you know, about
the world and, you know, like,

1918
02:00:28,820 --> 02:00:33,530
right as the purple sage written in
1915. And I think, you know, and,

1919
02:00:33,590 --> 02:00:37,660
um, and, and then, you know, I,

1920
02:00:37,840 --> 02:00:41,780
I started realizing the same thing about
other books that I had written, this,

1921
02:00:41,781 --> 02:00:45,870
you know, like started to seek
them out, you know, and, and, uh,

1922
02:00:47,050 --> 02:00:51,060
uh, a lot of it was, it was helped by the
fact that my, my father and all the time,

1923
02:00:51,061 --> 02:00:53,840
he had a big library and I could kind
of read in his library, you know,

1924
02:00:53,841 --> 02:00:56,410
and it's like, oh, you know, it's like,
you know, I had all seen, you know,

1925
02:00:56,510 --> 02:00:59,720
the Charlie Chan movies. No, he
hasn't. Charlie Chan novel, you know,

1926
02:00:59,721 --> 02:01:04,160
by Joseph James Earl biggers,
you know, and I go, let me
read that. And, oh my God,

1927
02:01:04,161 --> 02:01:07,550
it's like a time machine. It's like
the casual racism, you know, it's like,

1928
02:01:07,580 --> 02:01:12,170
you know, where, you know, people refer to
him as the Chink, you know, you know, and,

1929
02:01:12,530 --> 02:01:16,130
and, but more than that was just
this view that the one I read,

1930
02:01:16,131 --> 02:01:21,080
I forget what the title was,
but it was, uh, the, uh,

1931
02:01:21,140 --> 02:01:23,420
some family from Philadelphia,

1932
02:01:23,421 --> 02:01:27,950
the daughter has runaway to San Francisco
and from there to Honolulu and the

1933
02:01:27,951 --> 02:01:30,920
view of California,
you know,

1934
02:01:32,090 --> 02:01:36,670
distant land, that sort of
kind of the wild, you know,

1935
02:01:36,770 --> 02:01:39,690
literally the wild west and then,
you know,

1936
02:01:39,710 --> 02:01:42,500
Honolulu off the edge of the earth,
you know,

1937
02:01:42,501 --> 02:01:46,430
and it's just like this piece of
magic where you kind of, you know,

1938
02:01:46,431 --> 02:01:50,060
see into the past. And then, yeah,
as I mentioned to Anthony Trollope,

1939
02:01:50,070 --> 02:01:54,740
or are you kind of looking into the
depths of life in the Victorian era or,

1940
02:01:54,741 --> 02:01:59,500
or, uh, but what I find that
sort of interesting, uh,

1941
02:01:59,980 --> 02:02:00,331
and I,

1942
02:02:00,331 --> 02:02:05,331
I started to seek out our books
that are largely forgotten because,

1943
02:02:06,120 --> 02:02:10,030
you know, or, or they have some, you
know, some piece of them has survived,

1944
02:02:10,090 --> 02:02:13,330
but they haven't survived, you know,
like everybody knows Charles Dickens,

1945
02:02:13,420 --> 02:02:17,020
you know. Um, but you know,

1946
02:02:17,200 --> 02:02:20,980
only a certain number of people,
yeah, we'll have read, uh,

1947
02:02:21,520 --> 02:02:26,260
George Demaria is a trilby.
Right. But almost everybody knows,

1948
02:02:26,500 --> 02:02:30,930
uh, uh, maybe not everybody, I'm, I'm
probably showing off too much, uh,

1949
02:02:30,970 --> 02:02:32,490
literary,
but yeah,

1950
02:02:32,600 --> 02:02:37,360
they've heard about mesmerism and they've
heard about us Bengali, right? Well,

1951
02:02:37,361 --> 02:02:40,870
Svengali is a character in George do.

1952
02:02:40,880 --> 02:02:44,710
Mara is a book write a
Trilby, which is, and it's,

1953
02:02:44,711 --> 02:02:48,800
it's about mesmerism. And the way
mesmerism was this sort of, uh, you know,

1954
02:02:49,060 --> 02:02:51,340
hypnotism was,
you know,

1955
02:02:51,460 --> 02:02:55,300
this rage through Victorian society,
you know, in the eighties and nineties,

1956
02:02:55,301 --> 02:02:59,740
you know, or he was fascinated
by it. And it was just, you
know, it's like, you know,

1957
02:02:59,800 --> 02:03:04,030
I guess it'd be a little bit like
reading more and more recently, you know,

1958
02:03:04,300 --> 02:03:06,880
Ken Casey's electric koolaid acid test,
you know,

1959
02:03:06,910 --> 02:03:09,880
they're kind of Guinness or something,
her Thomas Pynchon, you know,

1960
02:03:09,881 --> 02:03:13,820
kind of getting into the, you know,
the, the world of psychic, you know,

1961
02:03:13,910 --> 02:03:18,910
Psychedelia and that era of
the seventies. Right. Um,

1962
02:03:19,380 --> 02:03:22,360
you know, or for that matter
reading, you know, uh, you know,

1963
02:03:22,361 --> 02:03:27,361
there will be a time when somebody could
read Michael LewisLewis' and out wires

1964
02:03:28,451 --> 02:03:33,280
poker and it will be a time machine
into this place when, you know,

1965
02:03:33,281 --> 02:03:37,270
our financial economy went crazily wrong.
And guess what,

1966
02:03:37,420 --> 02:03:41,080
there's actually a novel about that by
Anthony Trollope called the way we live

1967
02:03:41,081 --> 02:03:45,940
now about the great railroad
bobbles of the 1860s.

1968
02:03:47,290 --> 02:03:50,980
And so, you know, it, it, you
know, in some ways fiction is,

1969
02:03:51,040 --> 02:03:55,760
is also a key part of, uh, you know,

1970
02:03:55,780 --> 02:03:57,790
a way to learn about history.

1971
02:03:58,810 --> 02:04:03,810
And in a way that's a little
deeper because one of the
things that I think we're

1972
02:04:04,121 --> 02:04:08,710
not very good at is, um,

1973
02:04:09,910 --> 02:04:13,090
you know,
we rewrite history all the time.

1974
02:04:13,540 --> 02:04:15,580
So if you read a modern history,

1975
02:04:16,840 --> 02:04:21,310
you're reading what we think about it now.
Yeah.

1976
02:04:21,340 --> 02:04:24,340
So you could read an old book of history,
but when you read a novel,

1977
02:04:24,550 --> 02:04:28,720
you are reading how people thought,
what they were struggling with.

1978
02:04:29,440 --> 02:04:34,090
You know, you read a book like a, another
trollop that I love. Can you forgive her?

1979
02:04:34,180 --> 02:04:39,180
It's this sort of pro tow feminist novel
about these women who made choices that

1980
02:04:40,021 --> 02:04:45,021
were unconventional and who they would
marry and the fact that that was even an

1981
02:04:45,301 --> 02:04:49,800
issue, you know? But yeah, we kind
of look back on that, but it's like,

1982
02:04:49,920 --> 02:04:53,190
oh my God, you can see it,
you know, as a moral struggle.

1983
02:04:53,191 --> 02:04:57,100
And he's kind of trying to set you up
to say yes, you can forgive her. Yeah.

1984
02:04:57,210 --> 02:05:00,660
Cause she didn't marry the, the,
the, the socially approved guy.

1985
02:05:02,270 --> 02:05:03,810
He's like,
you know,

1986
02:05:03,840 --> 02:05:07,980
like it just gives you
a deeper insight into

1987
02:05:09,660 --> 02:05:11,220
our own world because,

1988
02:05:11,820 --> 02:05:12,230
okay.

1989
02:05:12,230 --> 02:05:16,550
One of the things that were in this
kind of brings me back to, you know,

1990
02:05:16,610 --> 02:05:19,790
of course ipps gave the
structural differential. The
map is not the territory.

1991
02:05:19,850 --> 02:05:22,100
My training with George Simon,
you know,

1992
02:05:22,490 --> 02:05:27,490
learning to see our own
world in the same way,

1993
02:05:28,280 --> 02:05:31,430
you know, that um, you know,

1994
02:05:31,431 --> 02:05:36,080
the things that we take for granted
will,

1995
02:05:36,360 --> 02:05:36,760
you know,

1996
02:05:36,760 --> 02:05:40,450
we will one day look back on or other
people will look back on and say how

1997
02:05:40,451 --> 02:05:45,170
quaint and you know, the,
the, and in our own lives,

1998
02:05:45,470 --> 02:05:50,210
our daily lives, you know,
the ability to sort of go,

1999
02:05:50,211 --> 02:05:50,900
oh wait,

2000
02:05:50,900 --> 02:05:55,900
this way that I have always been may
not be the only way to be that I can

2001
02:05:56,601 --> 02:06:00,260
change. So seeing change is, is,

2002
02:06:00,290 --> 02:06:02,450
is a prelude to being changed.

2003
02:06:03,420 --> 02:06:07,800
So this, this I think is a great
place to, to start to wrap up.

2004
02:06:07,801 --> 02:06:12,030
And I have this question I've been
wanting to ask since we started,

2005
02:06:12,060 --> 02:06:17,060
but I think that it's more of the answer
will be more impactful now that we've

2006
02:06:17,071 --> 02:06:20,400
covered a lot of the context.
What do you do?

2007
02:06:20,401 --> 02:06:24,630
You strike me and I think many
people is extremely optimistic,

2008
02:06:24,631 --> 02:06:26,850
extremely upbeat.
Uh,

2009
02:06:26,880 --> 02:06:31,560
what do you do or what have you done
when you felt down or been going through

2010
02:06:31,561 --> 02:06:35,120
periods of a darker times?
Because there,

2011
02:06:35,140 --> 02:06:39,180
there are a lot of people who would
like to be change of some type,

2012
02:06:39,810 --> 02:06:44,810
but they feel intimidated or depressed
for whether it's personal reasons or

2013
02:06:45,841 --> 02:06:49,050
because every time they open the newspaper
it looks like the world is falling

2014
02:06:49,051 --> 02:06:52,500
apart in every possible respect.
Uh,

2015
02:06:52,740 --> 02:06:57,420
what do you do when you
arch your usual upbeat,

2016
02:06:57,421 --> 02:06:59,520
optimistic self if that happens?

2017
02:07:00,210 --> 02:07:04,760
Yeah, well, uh, you know,
uh, one, one of the, uh, I,

2018
02:07:04,800 --> 02:07:05,590
I sent,

2019
02:07:05,590 --> 02:07:09,450
I gave Romaji and the opening to sesame
street and I have to give a little

2020
02:07:09,451 --> 02:07:13,560
homage also to the other, a wonderful
teacher of children, Mr. Rogers.

2021
02:07:15,180 --> 02:07:19,430
And by the way, it, you know,
before I had kids, I thought,

2022
02:07:19,440 --> 02:07:23,850
Mr. Rogers, this is the stupidest
thing ever. Once you have kids,

2023
02:07:24,150 --> 02:07:28,980
you go, oh my God, this
guy was a genius. You know,

2024
02:07:28,990 --> 02:07:33,750
I'm just, I'm blessed, you
know, to me, I just, he was a
genius anyway. And I, I have,

2025
02:07:33,810 --> 02:07:37,990
there's a video of him of him
doing congressional testimony was,

2026
02:07:38,290 --> 02:07:41,670
I forget who it was, what was the
reason? It was sort of, I was about Pv,

2027
02:07:41,700 --> 02:07:43,030
the early days of PBS.

2028
02:07:43,810 --> 02:07:47,140
And you watched this congressman who's
sort of hostile in the beginning,

2029
02:07:47,141 --> 02:07:51,850
just so they're gradually just sort of
start nodding and smiling. It's so great.

2030
02:07:51,880 --> 02:07:54,270
But I digress.
But the great thing that the,

2031
02:07:54,280 --> 02:07:58,690
your question is this fabulous
quote from Fred Rogers, you know,

2032
02:07:58,830 --> 02:08:02,050
on his show, he's telling Joe,
when you see bad things happen,

2033
02:08:02,560 --> 02:08:04,720
look around for the
people who are helping.

2034
02:08:05,490 --> 02:08:09,250
There were always people
helping and you know,

2035
02:08:09,251 --> 02:08:12,850
it's just such great life advice,
you know, it's like, you know,

2036
02:08:12,900 --> 02:08:16,500
and I just actually just tweeted something
like that the other day, you know, I,

2037
02:08:16,501 --> 02:08:19,990
as I had just come
across, uh, you know, uh,

2038
02:08:19,991 --> 02:08:24,070
there was a new video about planet
labs. Uh, one of my companies,

2039
02:08:24,071 --> 02:08:25,880
I'm an investor in, you know, they're,

2040
02:08:25,881 --> 02:08:29,250
they're trying to image the surface
of the earth every day. You know,

2041
02:08:29,290 --> 02:08:31,950
they call their, you know,
their satellites, dubs,

2042
02:08:31,960 --> 02:08:35,550
they said like all these
military satellites, they
all have, you know, you know,

2043
02:08:35,930 --> 02:08:40,570
Dave's a wrap doors and we wanted ours
to signal there for peace. You know,

2044
02:08:40,571 --> 02:08:43,560
and this is great piece about their,
you know, their, their launch of,

2045
02:08:43,610 --> 02:08:48,280
of the largest, you know, a flock
of earth imaging satellites.

2046
02:08:48,290 --> 02:08:51,090
And you know,
I just kind of boasting it with the,

2047
02:08:51,160 --> 02:08:54,490
I think the tweak was something like, you
know, if you need your dose of optimism,

2048
02:08:55,020 --> 02:08:59,950
uh, you know, you know, watch this video,
you know, because here's somebody who's,

2049
02:09:00,270 --> 02:09:04,060
you know, doing something idealistic
maybe was it, I said you do some idealism,

2050
02:09:04,270 --> 02:09:04,930
you know,
kind of,

2051
02:09:04,930 --> 02:09:09,880
so look for people who are helping
the world be a better place.

2052
02:09:11,400 --> 02:09:16,260
Well, Tim, I think you are
one of those people and I,

2053
02:09:16,261 --> 02:09:19,980
we could, we could talk for
hours and hours more, but I will,

2054
02:09:20,490 --> 02:09:23,130
I think bring this one to a close,

2055
02:09:23,131 --> 02:09:26,400
but first so people
can find you elsewhere,

2056
02:09:26,550 --> 02:09:31,550
learn more about you and the book and
everything else that you are up to.

2057
02:09:32,580 --> 02:09:36,270
Where would you suggest people
find you on the Internet?

2058
02:09:36,810 --> 02:09:39,220
Well, probably the best
place right now is a cycle.

2059
02:09:39,240 --> 02:09:44,240
Tim Dot [inaudible] dot com so [inaudible]
dot com which is our online learning

2060
02:09:45,121 --> 02:09:47,450
platform, which includes, you know,

2061
02:09:47,730 --> 02:09:51,450
tens of thousands of ebooks from mostly
on technology and business topics,

2062
02:09:51,451 --> 02:09:55,320
but increasingly other things, uh,
but also videos, live training.

2063
02:09:55,321 --> 02:10:00,150
It's really the core of our
entire business. Um, but uh,

2064
02:10:00,180 --> 02:10:04,440
but Tim's daughter riley.com sort of has
a, instead of my personal archive of,

2065
02:10:05,040 --> 02:10:08,460
for example, a link to this podcast
will go on there once it's up.

2066
02:10:09,210 --> 02:10:12,510
It also points to my book that will be a
site for the book, but it's not up yet.

2067
02:10:12,580 --> 02:10:16,110
The, the, the, the site will be
called [inaudible] e t f economy.com.

2068
02:10:16,620 --> 02:10:20,920
And I think the book is, is
something that, it's a, uh, it,

2069
02:10:20,950 --> 02:10:24,390
it's really covers a lot of the
topics we talked about today,

2070
02:10:24,391 --> 02:10:27,270
but also a lot more, I mean there's
a lot about how do you think,

2071
02:10:27,550 --> 02:10:31,920
how to draw a map of your business
model and how to think about the

2072
02:10:31,921 --> 02:10:35,180
implications. You, for example,
I spent a lot of time on, okay,

2073
02:10:35,390 --> 02:10:38,330
dissecting the business model of
Uber and Lyft and then saying,

2074
02:10:38,360 --> 02:10:41,480
what does this teach us about their
story, about self driving cars. You know,

2075
02:10:41,481 --> 02:10:43,700
like if you draw a
correct map of the world,

2076
02:10:43,970 --> 02:10:48,670
it tells you something about
the future. Uh, and so, uh,

2077
02:10:48,800 --> 02:10:50,160
but anyway, so, so you know,

2078
02:10:50,180 --> 02:10:53,210
I would say go to Tim dot [inaudible]
dot com and from there you'll,

2079
02:10:53,270 --> 02:10:54,290
you'll find everything else

2080
02:10:54,920 --> 02:10:59,920
and then on the best place to say hello
and social that be at O'reilly media or

2081
02:11:00,480 --> 02:11:03,920
uh, at, at Tim O'reilly, Oily Tan.

2082
02:11:04,440 --> 02:11:08,160
I do see all my, my app
messages. Uh, and uh,

2083
02:11:08,400 --> 02:11:13,260
also I respond to email and if you
know my name, you can guess my email.

2084
02:11:15,890 --> 02:11:19,550
Well, Tim, thank you so
much for taking the time.

2085
02:11:19,580 --> 02:11:24,580
This was really fun for me and I have
a reading list as long as my arm,

2086
02:11:25,521 --> 02:11:28,760
which I'm prepared to dig
into. Uh, is there anything,

2087
02:11:29,960 --> 02:11:34,960
any question or suggestion suggested
action that you would have for people

2088
02:11:36,081 --> 02:11:38,540
listening before we completely wrap up?

2089
02:11:40,640 --> 02:11:42,530
Well, uh, I guess the, the,

2090
02:11:42,531 --> 02:11:47,531
the biggest advice I would have is so
trying to create a daily practice where

2091
02:11:50,150 --> 02:11:54,170
you stop thinking and
start listening to nothing

2092
02:11:55,880 --> 02:12:00,830
and that they, some people would call
that meditation. Uh, but it could be just,

2093
02:12:00,890 --> 02:12:05,840
you know, like when you go, you know,
if you go for a run, uh, don't think,

2094
02:12:06,380 --> 02:12:11,060
just let things come into your
head. You know, if you, uh,

2095
02:12:11,110 --> 02:12:13,360
you know,
sit by a fire or go sailing,

2096
02:12:13,380 --> 02:12:16,640
those are good activities for letting
that happen. Going for a very,

2097
02:12:16,641 --> 02:12:20,150
very long walk till all the thoughts
fall away because, you know,

2098
02:12:20,151 --> 02:12:22,220
cultivating that,
uh,

2099
02:12:23,330 --> 02:12:27,780
that headspace and that soul space where,
uh,

2100
02:12:27,950 --> 02:12:32,950
you're not filling it up with the stuff
you already have you already know,

2101
02:12:34,160 --> 02:12:39,080
but are just, uh, listening is
that, that Morgan's Tarot card,

2102
02:12:39,140 --> 02:12:40,580
always remember this,

2103
02:12:41,120 --> 02:12:46,120
the space that let stuff come in to
you and surprise you and give you a new

2104
02:12:46,401 --> 02:12:50,030
thoughts and, and you know,
give rise to curiosity.

2105
02:12:51,830 --> 02:12:55,700
I think that is the perfect place to
wrap up. Tim. Thank you so much again.

2106
02:12:56,360 --> 02:12:58,490
I really appreciate you taking the time.

2107
02:12:59,420 --> 02:13:03,570
Everybody's check out everything
including your writing on media music.

2108
02:13:03,580 --> 02:13:05,170
Great piece on,
uh,

2109
02:13:05,840 --> 02:13:09,460
how you separate out fake
news from real news that a,

2110
02:13:09,470 --> 02:13:14,020
I think it should be required reading
so much more that we can dig into, uh,

2111
02:13:14,260 --> 02:13:18,650
to thank you first and foremost
and to everybody listening,

2112
02:13:18,680 --> 02:13:22,820
you can find the show notes, so links
to everything that we've discussed,

2113
02:13:22,940 --> 02:13:27,560
including Tim's new book and
everything else in the show notes at

2114
02:13:27,650 --> 02:13:30,650
tim.blog/podcast along
with every other episode.

2115
02:13:30,680 --> 02:13:33,330
It's just check those
out at tim.blog/podcast

2116
02:13:33,750 --> 02:13:38,460
and as always, until next time,
thank you for listening. Hey guys,

2117
02:13:38,461 --> 02:13:42,420
this is Tim again. Just a few more
things before you take off. Number one,

2118
02:13:42,660 --> 02:13:47,580
this is five bullet Friday.
Do you want to get a short email from me?

2119
02:13:47,610 --> 02:13:50,250
Would you enjoy getting a short
email from me every Friday?

2120
02:13:50,520 --> 02:13:54,780
That provides a little more soul of
fun before the weekend and five bullet

2121
02:13:54,781 --> 02:13:59,400
Friday is a very short email where I share
the coolest things I've found or that

2122
02:13:59,401 --> 02:14:00,960
I've been pondering over the week.

2123
02:14:01,200 --> 02:14:03,960
That could include favorite new
albums that I've discovered.

2124
02:14:03,961 --> 02:14:07,440
It could include Gizmos and gadgets
and all sorts of weird shit that I've

2125
02:14:07,441 --> 02:14:11,730
somehow dug up in the, uh, the
world of the esoteric as I do.

2126
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:17,000
It could include favorite articles that
I've read and that I've shared with my

2127
02:14:17,671 --> 02:14:20,400
close friends for instance.
And it's very short.

2128
02:14:20,490 --> 02:14:25,470
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness
before you head off for the weekend.

2129
02:14:25,530 --> 02:14:27,690
So if you want to receive that,
check it out.

2130
02:14:27,960 --> 02:14:32,610
Just go to four hour work week.com that's
four hour work week.com all spelled

2131
02:14:32,611 --> 02:14:35,790
out and just drop in your email
and you will get the very next one.

2132
02:14:36,210 --> 02:14:37,890
And if you sign up,
I hope you enjoy it.

2133
02:14:39,210 --> 02:14:41,880
This episode is brought
to you by zip recruiter.

2134
02:14:42,150 --> 02:14:45,270
You may have heard them everywhere.
They're growing like crazy.

2135
02:14:45,780 --> 02:14:49,020
They're an innovative platform
for doing several things,

2136
02:14:49,021 --> 02:14:52,950
but especially improving
the hiring process,

2137
02:14:53,010 --> 02:14:55,500
making it slick and elegant and easy.

2138
02:14:55,830 --> 02:14:58,380
One of the hardest parts
of running any business,

2139
02:14:58,381 --> 02:15:02,640
growing any business is finding
and hiring the right team.

2140
02:15:02,641 --> 02:15:07,320
I've seen this firsthand in close
to a hundred startups. Now, God,

2141
02:15:07,321 --> 02:15:11,670
I'm getting old from all over the
world at different stages of growth and

2142
02:15:11,730 --> 02:15:16,530
nothing can quite drain your
resources and cost you time and money,

2143
02:15:16,830 --> 02:15:19,950
like making mistakes
in hiring ZipRecruiter,

2144
02:15:20,330 --> 02:15:25,230
develop their own system and their own
platform for helping you to solve two of

2145
02:15:25,231 --> 02:15:29,880
the biggest problems and bottlenecks for
employers posting jobs easily and then

2146
02:15:29,970 --> 02:15:33,360
they can get even easier to
find the best candidates.

2147
02:15:34,170 --> 02:15:35,730
Unlike other job sites,

2148
02:15:35,810 --> 02:15:39,480
ZipRecruiter does an effect the
opposite of what you'd expect.

2149
02:15:39,481 --> 02:15:43,560
So they do not depend on
candidates finding you there.

2150
02:15:43,561 --> 02:15:47,010
Technology finds the right
candidate for you and in fact,

2151
02:15:47,011 --> 02:15:50,820
more than 80% of the jobs posted on
ZipRecruiter return a qualified candidate

2152
02:15:51,030 --> 02:15:55,050
based on your criteria that
you select in just 24 hours.

2153
02:15:55,290 --> 02:15:59,280
So no more juggling email reviewing
hundreds of unqualified candidates.

2154
02:15:59,490 --> 02:16:01,230
I've been there, done
that. Don't recommend it.

2155
02:16:01,680 --> 02:16:04,290
We're dealing with calls to the
office, et Cetera. None of that.

2156
02:16:04,350 --> 02:16:09,230
Simply screen rate and manage
your candidates all in one
place on Ziprecruiter's

2157
02:16:09,240 --> 02:16:13,860
dashboard. And as a listener of
the Tim Ferriss show for that,

2158
02:16:14,280 --> 02:16:18,180
ZipRecruiter wants to allow you to start
posting jobs and trying their services

2159
02:16:18,181 --> 02:16:19,950
for free.
So if you're thinking of hiring somebody,

2160
02:16:19,951 --> 02:16:23,070
you need to find me and my executive
assistant and you'd to find a developer,

2161
02:16:23,071 --> 02:16:23,910
whatever it might be,

2162
02:16:24,370 --> 02:16:29,370
try out just visit ziprecruiter.com/tim
and you can experience this up.

2163
02:16:30,280 --> 02:16:35,170
Just hell used by businesses
on over and over again.

2164
02:16:35,730 --> 02:16:39,040
I ended up getting again whole
time fighting for causes dot.

2165
02:16:39,730 --> 02:16:43,360
My Buddy Kevin Rose, no to
forever, some of you know,

2166
02:16:43,420 --> 02:16:48,420
and he showed up at my gate at my house
a while back and he looked fantastic.

2167
02:16:50,860 --> 02:16:53,690
I asked him as said, dude, you look
great. What the hell have you been up to?

2168
02:16:53,700 --> 02:16:55,810
Because he's always doing
a weird diet or another,

2169
02:16:55,811 --> 02:16:57,310
but it only lasts like a week or two.

2170
02:16:57,370 --> 02:17:01,180
So he always regresses to the mean
after like 75 beers. And he said,

2171
02:17:01,181 --> 02:17:03,370
I've been doing peloton five days a week.

2172
02:17:03,520 --> 02:17:08,440
Now that caught my attention because Kevin
does nothing five days a week and you

2173
02:17:08,441 --> 02:17:11,680
know, I love you Kevin, but
it really peaked my curiosity.

2174
02:17:11,740 --> 02:17:16,740
Ended up getting a system and it's
become an integral part of my week.

2175
02:17:17,080 --> 02:17:21,640
I love it and I really didn't expect to
love it at all because I find cycling

2176
02:17:21,641 --> 02:17:23,230
really boring usually.

2177
02:17:23,350 --> 02:17:28,330
But peloton is an indoor cycling bike
that brings live studio classes right into

2178
02:17:28,331 --> 02:17:29,164
your home.

2179
02:17:29,260 --> 02:17:31,750
You don't have to worry about fitting
classes into your schedule or making it to

2180
02:17:31,751 --> 02:17:34,210
a studio with some type of cute et cetera.

2181
02:17:34,240 --> 02:17:38,320
New classes are added every day and this
includes options led by elite New York

2182
02:17:38,321 --> 02:17:39,730
City instructors in your own living room.

2183
02:17:40,150 --> 02:17:43,810
You can even livestream studio classes
taught by the world's best instructors or

2184
02:17:43,811 --> 02:17:46,210
find your own favorite class on demand.

2185
02:17:46,211 --> 02:17:50,560
And in fact Kevin and I rarely do live
classes and you can compete with your

2186
02:17:50,561 --> 02:17:52,630
friends, which is also fun. Kevin,

2187
02:17:52,660 --> 02:17:56,830
I'm coming after you but we
usually just use classes on demand.

2188
02:17:56,920 --> 02:17:59,370
I really like Matt Wilbur's and his iron,

2189
02:17:59,440 --> 02:18:03,310
high intensity training sessions
that are shorter, like 20 minutes.

2190
02:18:03,970 --> 02:18:08,890
And I think Kevin's favorite is Alex and
everyone seems to have their favorite

2191
02:18:09,430 --> 02:18:12,610
instructor or you can select
by music duration and so on.

2192
02:18:13,180 --> 02:18:18,160
Each Peloton bike includes a 22 inch HD
touchscreen performance tracking metrics.

2193
02:18:18,161 --> 02:18:22,750
I think that along with the real time
leaderboard are the main reasons that this

2194
02:18:22,751 --> 02:18:27,130
caught my attention when cycling
never had caught my attention before.

2195
02:18:27,160 --> 02:18:30,640
It's really pretty stunning what they've
done with the user interface to keep

2196
02:18:30,641 --> 02:18:31,474
your attention.

2197
02:18:31,660 --> 02:18:35,560
The belt drive is quiet and it's smaller
than you would expect so it can fit in

2198
02:18:35,561 --> 02:18:39,520
a living room or an office.
I actually have it in a large closet,

2199
02:18:39,560 --> 02:18:42,930
believe it or not and
it fits with no problem.

2200
02:18:42,970 --> 02:18:47,950
So peloton is offering all of you guys,
listeners of the Tim Ferriss show,

2201
02:18:47,951 --> 02:18:52,951
a special offer and it is actually special
visit one Peloton that's o n e p e l

2204
02:19:04,630 --> 02:19:06,790
Now you might say men accessories.
Wait,

2205
02:19:06,791 --> 02:19:11,380
I don't need fancy towels or whatever
other supplemental bits. And pieces.

2206
02:19:11,590 --> 02:19:13,630
No,
the shoes you need,

2207
02:19:13,631 --> 02:19:16,660
you need the clip in shoes and
those are in the accessory category.

2208
02:19:16,661 --> 02:19:20,170
