1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:04,270
Joe, welcome to the show.
Tim. Thank you so much buddy.

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:08,470
Then I'm so excited to
finally have you here.

3
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,720
So thanks for flying out.
Of course. My pleasure.

4
00:00:10,721 --> 00:00:14,110
Here we are in Tay Hos and where to begin.

5
00:00:14,111 --> 00:00:17,470
I mean we've had the opportunity to get
to know each other over the last while,

6
00:00:17,471 --> 00:00:20,560
which has been super fun,
fed some unique peak experiences,

7
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:23,380
which I'll leave nebulous just so
everyone's really uncomfortable with that

8
00:00:23,381 --> 00:00:27,460
statement. And, and uh, where to begin?

9
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:28,420
We were talking about this,

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,890
I was having excessive
numbers of Macchiatos earlier
while I was watching you

11
00:00:32,891 --> 00:00:35,550
eat your French toast.
And uh,

12
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:41,430
I think the question to start with is
what is your first memory of causing

13
00:00:41,711 --> 00:00:42,930
trouble or getting into trouble?

14
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,360
Well, um, let's see. To go back,

15
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,190
I think it would probably be around

16
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:55,890
second grade has a second grade.
Well,

17
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,830
you have to understand, when I
was young, I was really into art,

18
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:02,640
into drawing and around the second grade,

19
00:01:02,641 --> 00:01:06,750
the teenage mutant Ninja turtles came
out, right. And like big deal, big deal.

20
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:10,980
I was totally hooked on
Tele. Michelangelo, Raphael,
everybody like I was,

21
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:11,993
I was in it.

22
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,500
And so I started drawing them and
I just had such a good time drying.

23
00:01:16,501 --> 00:01:18,210
Then I would show them to my classmates.

24
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:23,880
I remember the second grade
and my classmates started
to want to buy them from

25
00:01:23,881 --> 00:01:24,714
me.

26
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,100
And so I would mount them on this
like really special poster board.

27
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:34,470
And I'd come into class and like I would
be selling these for the total of $1.

28
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,790
If you want to get a big one,
I would sell you the bigger ones for $2.

29
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:44,190
And so I was having a ball. I'm
doing what I loved, making drawings,

30
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,830
the classmates and like make an
extra, you know, allowance every week.

31
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,800
A dollar is a lot of money when you're in
second grade, we deal, it's a big deal.

32
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,690
And so, uh, I at one point that my
teacher pulls me aside and she says,

33
00:01:54,691 --> 00:01:55,560
I need to talk to you.

34
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:01,350
And she begins to explain to me that
students were so interested in these

35
00:02:01,351 --> 00:02:04,170
drawings that they were asking their
parents for extra lunch money and their

36
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,360
parents were like,
what are you next to lunch money for?

37
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,090
And they traced it back to me.
And the, the teacher shut me down.

38
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:12,060
Like you can't be doing this.

39
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:14,650
All right.
So already

40
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:18,560
signs of looming misbehavior.

41
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,800
Uh, yeah. And, and the
signs of, of, uh, you know,

42
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,520
spotting an opportunity
and doing something about
entrepreneurship. Yeah. Yeah.

43
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:29,370
It was also, you know, you can say
my first brush with regulation.

44
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,800
Yeah. First brush that, that,

45
00:02:33,801 --> 00:02:36,530
that may or may not come in handy later,
maybe.

46
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,350
And where were you at the time?

47
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:42,950
Just the places geographically.
Where did you grow up?

48
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,860
Uh, my parents are from New York. Uh,

49
00:02:44,861 --> 00:02:49,110
Wa my grandfather's heritage
back in Italy and Ireland,

50
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:52,020
grandfathers in Brooklyn,
parents grew up in long island,

51
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,470
moved to Georgia right before they had me.

52
00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:00,250
So I grew up in the deep south and I was
in, you know, the town of Warrensville,

53
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,350
which is next to Snellville,
which is near Lilburn,

54
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,720
which is not far from Norcross.
We just kind of close to Atlanta.

55
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:11,280
So if you went, you know, an hour in one
direction, you'd, you'd be in, you know,

56
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:16,240
farm fields and you know,
horse ranches and um, it'd be,

57
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:20,350
uh, you know, it was, it was, it
was a south in every kind of way.

58
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:24,280
So you're selling these drawings now,

59
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:29,140
where did that impulse come from?
And I ask,

60
00:03:29,141 --> 00:03:34,030
because I've had the chance to spend
some time with your dad. Awesome guy.

61
00:03:34,031 --> 00:03:34,840
It's true.

62
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,840
We were together at a date with destiny
event and you had the very good idea of

63
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,880
basically creating animal house by
renting a house together on Joe Bnb,

64
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:52,840
otherwise known as Airbnb.
And Your Dad's awesome.

65
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:56,260
A also seems to be very entrepreneurial.

66
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:01,910
So that's why I'm asking. I'm not implying
it came straight from your dad, but, uh,

67
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:07,020
could you maybe talk about
that and then also what were,

68
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,750
what were some defining
characteristics of your childhood?

69
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,270
Well, certainly in both of
my parents and quitting.

70
00:04:13,271 --> 00:04:17,860
My Dad were very entrepreneurial. They
both worked for themselves growing up.

71
00:04:17,861 --> 00:04:20,470
So I had this, um, you know,

72
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:23,650
environment where I saw my
parents forging their own path,

73
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:28,210
sort of their success was fully
dependent on how hard they worked and how

74
00:04:28,211 --> 00:04:31,900
ambitious they were in their,
their careers of what they were doing.

75
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,670
And my dad certainly was entrepreneurial,
you know,

76
00:04:33,671 --> 00:04:36,100
he was always coming home with
something on the weekend saying,

77
00:04:36,101 --> 00:04:41,080
I've got this new product idea, I've got
this new service I found and, and um,

78
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:45,550
you know, or basement was full of these
different attempts at different things.

79
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:47,020
Um,
and so there was this,

80
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:51,010
this spirit of trying things out
by all means in our household.

81
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,120
What were some of the things
that you're done trying?

82
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,770
Um, I don't know. Some early
Internet things and the mid nineties,

83
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,770
as the Internet started to
come out, um, you know, I,

84
00:05:02,771 --> 00:05:03,500
I don't actually remember

85
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,710
what were some of the things that caught,
what did he, what did he end up doing?

86
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:12,640
Um, well, he ended up
working with my mom and, uh,

87
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:13,950
they both were in the
health food industry.

88
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,910
So when you go into whole foods and you
see enough vitamins and supplements in

89
00:05:17,911 --> 00:05:18,744
the vitamin aisle,

90
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:22,110
they were the representative between
the manufacturer of those products and

91
00:05:22,111 --> 00:05:23,580
getting into the shelf of those stores.

92
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:28,440
What was interesting was to tag along
with with them on business trips where

93
00:05:28,441 --> 00:05:33,441
they'd drive around the south from South
Carolina to Tennessee to Alabama and

94
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:39,360
getting to see how they interacted with
these store owners because it wasn't

95
00:05:39,361 --> 00:05:43,080
just whole foods, it was the also the mom
and pop vitamins tours as well. Right.

96
00:05:43,081 --> 00:05:45,800
Independence, independence. And so, um,

97
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,050
it was really fascinating watching them
interact with the store owners and it's

98
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,410
just seeing how far they would
go to serve people. You know,

99
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,160
I remember one time specifically we're
in Tennessee and it was really late at

100
00:05:58,161 --> 00:06:01,250
night. Uh, all the other store
employees have gone home.

101
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:05,900
It's my dad and myself and the store
manager and we're sitting there stocking

102
00:06:05,901 --> 00:06:10,220
shelves were like, this is Tennessee.
Yeah, we're doing somebody else's job.

103
00:06:10,221 --> 00:06:13,190
But for my dad, it was just
about creating a connection with,

104
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:18,350
with the store owner and really I guess
going above and beyond what was required

105
00:06:18,351 --> 00:06:21,490
of you. And so I really took
away from that, those, you know,

106
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:27,560
observations of watching how your
parents treat people. Um, you know,

107
00:06:27,561 --> 00:06:28,010
there's just,

108
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:32,000
it was really nice to see and it
definitely planted a seed in me of like,

109
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,660
you know, going out of your way for
those that you're serving your customers.

110
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:39,120
Was it your,
was it your dad's idea to bring you along?

111
00:06:39,121 --> 00:06:42,520
Did you ask to be brought along or
something else? I don't know. Yeah.

112
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,430
I remember the,

113
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:51,170
the very first morning in the
House that we rented Florida,

114
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:58,370
we had heard of date with destiny being
nicknamed by some people date with death

115
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,880
because the schedule is so intense,
right?

116
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,230
I 1216 God knows how
many hours it's up to,

117
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,880
up to the powers that be the big man and
so on. And it can be very hard to get,

118
00:07:11,881 --> 00:07:14,700
food can be very hard to get a break.
And even if you do get a break,

119
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:19,701
maybe there's a line of 300 people from
60 countries waiting to get a chicken

120
00:07:20,341 --> 00:07:22,230
wrap so you're not gonna
get your chicken wrap it.

121
00:07:22,231 --> 00:07:27,231
So we had stocked up with bars and
mixed nuts and yogurt and jerky and

122
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:33,981
everything imaginable and it
was scattered all over the place

123
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:40,970
and got up in the morning and the entire
collection of food had been rearranged,

124
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,620
like a point of sale display.

125
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:50,730
It was in perfect order. It was ready
for a storefront. And I was just like,

126
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,700
did you do that to my two of my
friend Avi? And he's like, no,

127
00:07:53,701 --> 00:07:58,410
I definitely didn't do that. I, and then
I knew Emilia hadn't done it. I was like,

128
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:03,210
who did? I was like, oh. Then Joe Sr
like, you'd be like some eggs. I'm happy.

129
00:08:03,211 --> 00:08:06,700
I'm making some eggs. Would do like
some side. I was like, wow. Yeah.

130
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:09,120
So it makes sense. It makes
sense. That attention to detail.

131
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:13,700
You got a little taste of, oh,
it was great. I was thrilled. Uh,

132
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,740
what else did you,

133
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,470
what else did you experience in childhood
that, that stuck with you? And I'll,

134
00:08:22,471 --> 00:08:23,450
I'll,
I'll,

135
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:28,410
I'll lead with one thing that I
originally asked you all about and when we

136
00:08:28,411 --> 00:08:30,270
initially spent time together

137
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:36,330
also related to Tony Robbins,
Tony's the glue that holds us together,

138
00:08:36,331 --> 00:08:38,730
which I didn't expect to
really be verbalizing that.

139
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:41,900
It seems at least up to this
point that he's been a, a, a,

140
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:46,620
a consistent character in the background
or in the foreground. He's a big dude,

141
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:47,483
hard to mess.

142
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:53,090
But we began talking about tennis because
I had just taken my first ever tennis

143
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:57,090
lessons,
uh,

144
00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:01,140
with Jim Lair and Lorenzo Beltrami,

145
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:04,810
an incredible coach down to
Florida. But you were wearing a, uh,

146
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,880
Nicole Terry or bold Cherry Academy shirt
and I knew just enough having read the

147
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:15,290
open autobiography by Andre
Agassi to recognize the name.

148
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:19,530
So I asked you about it. Uh, so
it seems like tennis was certain,

149
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:22,650
certainly something that was also,
oh my God, what are the families?

150
00:09:22,651 --> 00:09:23,680
So maybe you could talk
to them. Yeah. You had a

151
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,520
tennis family, you could say. I
think that's what they call that,

152
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:30,310
a time where every member of the family
plays tennis. We did coaching together,

153
00:09:30,311 --> 00:09:35,200
we played in Alta and Usta together.
We did and competitions together.

154
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,460
And it was a truly a family
sport growing up. Um,

155
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:44,740
and so tennis was a huge part of my life
as a kid amongst a lot of other sports.

156
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:49,430
I think that's the things that stood out
to me of, of childhood and things that,

157
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:53,950
one of things I'm really grateful for us
is that whatever my interest, where my,

158
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,960
my parents would support it.
Um,

159
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:00,490
and I think they learned
this lesson the hard way. Um,

160
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,800
how so they,

161
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:07,830
they got me into a violin when I was
really young when I was like about four or

162
00:10:07,901 --> 00:10:11,020
five years old, which you were interested
or not interested in it, right? I mean,

163
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,913
no,

164
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,360
and so I was taking violin lessons
and there's a recital that I,

165
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,860
I don't remember how old I was,
maybe six.

166
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:25,510
And I'm at this recital. It's in Savannah,
Georgia. I'm sorry, Augusta, Georgia.

167
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:30,130
And I'm definitely out of my depths here.

168
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,370
Like all the kids are bigger than me.
Um,

169
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:36,460
I'm not being able to keep up with
everyone else's plane and apparently I sat

170
00:10:36,461 --> 00:10:41,461
down on the front of the stage and
just put my violin down and there's my

171
00:10:42,161 --> 00:10:44,650
parents in the back,
probably the terrified look in their face.

172
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:50,850
And after that experience they switch
their perspective and said we're going to

173
00:10:52,391 --> 00:10:54,640
support whatever his intrinsic
interests are. Right?

174
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,720
And so I was really grateful for
that. You know, throughout my,

175
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:03,750
my childhood sports, music and
art are the three things that, uh,

176
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:07,120
anytime I throw my weight behind something
they were right there to support me.

177
00:11:07,121 --> 00:11:08,810
Whether it was, uh,
you know, practice law,

178
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:12,250
a sports practice or
sports equipment or um,

179
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:15,910
musical lessons or art supplies,
whatever the thing was,

180
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:20,770
they were there to support me in it.
What if not violin?

181
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:26,080
Where did you gravitate towards me
in music is in the violin lessons.

182
00:11:26,081 --> 00:11:30,220
I do remember this, this part I was
so eager to finish the vine lessons,

183
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:34,360
violin lessons that I could go bang on
the piano that was in the same music room.

184
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:38,650
And sure enough, I started taking piano
lessons and I've, I've played ever since.

185
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,840
Cool. So you still play? I do, yeah.

186
00:11:40,841 --> 00:11:44,300
I've got a piano at home and it's
like one of those things, you know,

187
00:11:44,301 --> 00:11:48,160
it's the first thing I do when I get home
at the end of the day is I just go jam

188
00:11:48,161 --> 00:11:53,050
on the piano. I either play some of
my favorite music from felonious monk,

189
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:56,950
Dave Brubeck or I just make
stuff up and kind of riff.

190
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:02,870
What other entrepreneurial experiences
do you recall from elementary school or

191
00:12:04,831 --> 00:12:09,810
high school after you got
the kibosh thrown on the
teenage mutant Ninja Turtles?

192
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:12,390
That certainly wasn't
the end. You know, I,

193
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:18,330
I distinctly remember a whole bunch of
things from part of the common stuff,

194
00:12:18,331 --> 00:12:21,480
right? Like I started a long
line business in my neighborhood,

195
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:26,700
so I put her on flyers on people's
doors and my neighborhood and offered 1

196
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:31,410
million car washing. And so, you
know, I'd Go Wah Milan for 20 bucks.

197
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,850
Um, no, that was quick money in
my pocket as a, as a kid. Um,

198
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,310
kind of getting into high school,

199
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:44,510
there was a one moment where senior
year came around and the senior year tee

200
00:12:45,001 --> 00:12:47,280
shirt that did, did my
high school, it was,

201
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:51,150
it was pretty uninspiring,
let's just call it that.

202
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:53,460
And I thought,
you know,

203
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,190
I bet I could do something
better than that at this point.

204
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,300
I just got my first Mac,

205
00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:02,330
my first apple computer
and it had Photoshop on it
and illustrator and graphic

206
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:07,400
software that you needed to, to
make you know, visuals. And so, um,

207
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,310
that's when it was actually warm
introductions to Photoshop was I just

208
00:13:11,311 --> 00:13:15,390
redesigned the t shirt and I didn't have
any money really other than the lawn

209
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:18,170
lane money that was coming in.
And um,

210
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:22,410
I figured out how to get these tee shirts
made. I went to a local printer, um,

211
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:23,940
figure out how to do all the,

212
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
transfer the files to them and suddenly
I'm sitting on about 300 tee shirts and

213
00:13:30,481 --> 00:13:31,950
I realize I got to go sell these things.

214
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:37,540
Okay, got it. So you took it
upon yourself to redesign the,

215
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:38,680
was it the highschool tee shirt?

216
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,580
Yeah, like this, the senior, the
senior at like the senior teacher,

217
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:45,890
the senior tee shirt, and then went out
and now you have a bunch of inventory.

218
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:49,560
I got a bunch of inventory
and I gotta go sell him. Um,

219
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:54,820
which will come up again later
in another story. Um, but yeah,

220
00:13:54,821 --> 00:13:57,460
it was, it was, it was fun.
And actually I remember, uh,

221
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,580
I did better than break even on those
and people were really happy to have a,

222
00:14:00,581 --> 00:14:05,460
a really memorable what the shirt, you
know, it was a riff on the, the tide logo.

223
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,330
The tide detergent.
Sure.

224
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:11,650
And so instead of Saint Titus had seniors
class of 2000 Brookwood high school

225
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,840
and um, it didn't really, well

226
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:18,830
see, so you didn't, you didn't bet
the farm and lose the farm yet,

227
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:19,983
at least broke even.

228
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:24,530
Yeah. Yeah, it was, it was,
it was fun to, to learn, you
know, how did you, some of the,

229
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:28,430
the graphics programs like Photoshop
and then also figure out like how do you

230
00:14:28,431 --> 00:14:30,770
turn that into something, right.
How does it leave your screening,

231
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:34,430
become some of the physical, and so
it was a great lesson. If anything.

232
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:37,600
Where did you think, now this was
senior year in high school? Yeah.

233
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:41,740
What did you think you were going to do
when you grew up per se at that point?

234
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,400
Well,
or what did you want to do?

235
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:47,930
So every year from elementary,
middle and high school,

236
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,560
the art teacher would tell you need to
take more art classes because it was a

237
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:57,470
talent that I had that stood out and then
they recognize it and were telling me

238
00:14:57,471 --> 00:14:59,160
about it.
And so you're,

239
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:03,090
every year I would invest
more into art classes and I,

240
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:07,280
at one point I was driving downtown to
the land of College of art and weekends

241
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,690
to take figure drawing classes.

242
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:14,080
Sometimes on weeknights I drive
down for painting classes and,

243
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,190
and then something really
incredible happened.

244
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:20,360
I applied for this program called the
governor's honors program in high school

245
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:24,500
where they take students from around the
state of Georgia across all disciplines,

246
00:15:24,501 --> 00:15:26,390
math and science and languages and art.

247
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:30,620
And they pick about 30 students
or the state for each discipline.

248
00:15:30,621 --> 00:15:34,370
And then if you get in,
you go to a college campus for the summer.

249
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,790
And he actually said he college level
coursework in whatever the discipline is.

250
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:41,420
So I went for art and had
an incredible time here.

251
00:15:41,421 --> 00:15:42,920
It was surrounded by some of the other,
you know,

252
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,570
the best artists in the state of
Georgia and other high school students.

253
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:51,850
And I had teachers who were
co collegiate level, uh,

254
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,440
challenging us the same way
they would a college student.

255
00:15:54,441 --> 00:15:58,010
And I freaking loved it.
And there was one woman in particular,

256
00:15:58,011 --> 00:16:01,880
her name was Donna and she was like one
of those people in life that you have

257
00:16:01,881 --> 00:16:05,090
along your journey who helped you.
It helps,

258
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:07,340
it helps you see something else about
yourself that maybe you don't quite

259
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:08,174
realize yet.

260
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:13,810
And so she sat me down one day during
this program and really kind of laid out

261
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:19,520
what it might look like if I pursued
art after, after high school.

262
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,120
And she was one of the first persons
that got me really excited about,

263
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:26,180
she made it realistic for
me to even think about it.

264
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:28,460
Was that even a practical
idea? Right. And she's like,

265
00:16:28,461 --> 00:16:31,640
there's one school you have to go to.
It's the Rhode Island School of design.

266
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,800
And I'm like the what,
where's that

267
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,570
and so something to Bahamas?
Yeah.

268
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:44,060
She put a [inaudible] on the map
for me and I was during that,

269
00:16:44,571 --> 00:16:48,860
that program during that, that summer,
um, I really dove into painting.

270
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:53,810
I did this painting that was about
eight feet by four feet wide,

271
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,740
stretch their own canvas and really like
threw myself and understand materials

272
00:16:57,741 --> 00:17:00,860
and paint better than ever ever before.

273
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:06,400
And we had the show at the end of the
program so you know everyone in art,

274
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:11,180
the discipline got to have like a gallery
show and there was my painting on the

275
00:17:11,181 --> 00:17:13,400
main wall when you walked
in and it was really like,

276
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:16,490
it was a moment for me to realize
that a people are appreciated.

277
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:20,030
The images that I made and my
art and seconds, I loved it.

278
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:24,230
Like I really felt challenged.
I felt creative. It was,

279
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:28,220
it was allowing me to fulfill all these,
these desires that I had to,

280
00:17:28,221 --> 00:17:29,054
to create things.

281
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:34,040
How much of that was the environment
versus the medium do you think?

282
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:34,700
I think the,

283
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,460
probably the environmental a bit more
cause the medium could have been anything.

284
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,860
Right. I mean, we did wreck
wreck, who, pottery and firing.

285
00:17:39,861 --> 00:17:42,620
We figure drawing and painting.

286
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,440
We were exposed to all kinds of
different mediums and materials.

287
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:49,530
I think the environment is what I fell
in love with the being challenged,

288
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:53,310
challenge being surrounded
by the creatives. And um,

289
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:57,120
and really that's what
triggered me to say, Huh,

290
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,920
this Rhode Island School of design thing.

291
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:04,310
So the next summer I did their high school
program and got to spend six weeks on

292
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:08,340
campus basically as like a, you
really act like a freshmen, right?

293
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,490
They give you again, college level
courses and afters do at Risley.

294
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:15,950
I fell in love with the campus, fell in
love with the people and you know, as it,

295
00:18:15,951 --> 00:18:19,170
as a junior in high school, I'm
like, I gotta go here. This is,

296
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,510
this is where I feel challenged.

297
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:25,170
So then what happens?
Well,

298
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:30,120
so before I leave, um, high school,

299
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:35,850
there's a, there's another story
about, um, entrepreneurial Joe.

300
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:41,400
Um,
so I haven't told the story in a while.

301
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:46,620
Uh, but so when I got to
high school as a freshman,

302
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,710
the senior class right before me had
pulled off as amazing senior prank.

303
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:56,790
So at our high school,
the mascot was a bronco horse.

304
00:18:57,050 --> 00:19:01,770
This was the Brookwood Broncos, and
they went down the street to this, uh,

305
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:05,490
like a country Western store where
you get cowboy boots and cowboy hats.

306
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:10,080
It's called horse town east. And on the
top of their sign, which was pretty tall,

307
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,880
it was a couple of store,
a couple of stories tall,

308
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:15,180
was this giant full sized plastic horse.

309
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:19,620
And somehow the senior class figured out
how to get the horse down from the sign

310
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:23,790
and then they'd put it on top of our
school. And so the last day of class,

311
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:28,350
everyone came in, there's a giant full
sized plastic horse on top of Brookwood.

312
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:33,600
And so when I showed up as a freshmen,
everybody was talking about it. I,

313
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,150
everyone's like, yeah. Did you hear
what the senior class did last year?

314
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:40,290
But for the graduated, yeah, and it,
I just started to think to myself,

315
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,300
I can, I want to outdo that. I've
got four years to think of something.

316
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:46,410
I'll keep it.

317
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:50,070
Surely I can come up with something better
than the horse on top of the school.

318
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:54,890
So I set myself a challenge, uh, frank,

319
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:59,280
um, by senior year. So the years go by,

320
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,400
it's not senior year.
Um,

321
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:06,780
and we have about four months ago and
I still haven't thought of anything.

322
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:10,340
And the clock's ticking.
It's now three months ago.

323
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,430
I still haven't thought of anything.

324
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:16,260
It's now two months to go and I uh,

325
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,950
I get on a Google, I search, you know,

326
00:20:19,951 --> 00:20:23,550
high school senior pranks just to see
like what else is out there because I'm

327
00:20:23,551 --> 00:20:24,780
still committed to figure something out.

328
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,410
And so I keep coming
across the same stuff.

329
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:31,890
You've got a super guru,
the locks, the doors,

330
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:35,490
you've got Philip Cups with water and
the gym and put them all next to each

331
00:20:35,491 --> 00:20:35,940
other.

332
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:40,940
They like knock over and then you've
got three pigs out in to the school and

333
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:44,720
label them one to four so everyone thinks
there's the third pig pigment around.

334
00:20:44,721 --> 00:20:45,840
So you know,

335
00:20:45,841 --> 00:20:50,600
it was like the repetition of how many
sites were covering these banks is like

336
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,930
these are not original.
And that was one of my cards here.

337
00:20:52,931 --> 00:20:54,670
Like this needs to be something original.

338
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,890
I'm not going to just
like copy another prank.

339
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,990
And so we're now like three
weeks until graduation.

340
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:04,360
Don't have any prank.
I haven't figured it out yet.

341
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:09,670
And my sister was a cheerleader and so
she'd have this cheerleading practice

342
00:21:09,671 --> 00:21:13,300
after school and normally I'd have
to hang around and take her home.

343
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:17,740
And so, um, outside after school one
day, and she's nowhere to be found,

344
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:19,300
this is before cell phones.

345
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:24,410
And the way that you track somebody
down at that time was to, um,

346
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,170
they'd make some announcement
over the intercom system.

347
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:30,190
They like called her names. So I go
into the front office and by the way,

348
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:34,780
I went to high school in Georgia.
That was one of the largest,

349
00:21:34,781 --> 00:21:37,330
we had over 4,000 people in a high school,
right.

350
00:21:37,331 --> 00:21:38,800
So this is one of the biggest
high schools in the state.

351
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:44,850
And I thought that to access
the inner calm would be some,

352
00:21:45,071 --> 00:21:47,920
you go in some room, there'd be some
big system. It'd be super complicated.

353
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,370
So I'm in the front office and I'm
looking at the secretary and I go, Hey,

354
00:21:51,371 --> 00:21:54,610
I'm just trying to find
my sister, Kim, can you,

355
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:58,540
can you Pedro over the Intercom and the
start? He goes, oh, sure. Just a minute.

356
00:21:58,690 --> 00:21:59,410
She picked,

357
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:04,410
she picks up the phone and she hits lb
zero zero on the dial pad and then she

358
00:22:06,911 --> 00:22:10,540
talks into the phone, Hey Kim,
Kim Gebbia, your brother's here,

359
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:14,260
please come to the front of the building
and everything she said into the phone

360
00:22:14,261 --> 00:22:16,930
came out over the intercom system
and I'm watching this and I'm going,

361
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:21,640
it's that easy to get into the intercom
system of the largest high school in the

362
00:22:21,641 --> 00:22:22,474
state of Georgia.

363
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:26,680
All you have to do is have access to
the phone line and hit pound zero zero.

364
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,760
I'm like, oh my God. It
was this big Aha moment.

365
00:22:30,761 --> 00:22:33,760
As I'm watching this unfold
in front of me and I go,

366
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:39,070
all I have to do is get one
of those splitter jacks,

367
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,560
plug it into the same phone line,

368
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:46,330
and then I can run a cord of another
phone somewhere else in the closet or

369
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:49,600
something. And then I could call in and
have access to the whole intercom system.

370
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,000
So for a week I'm toiling on this.
I'm like,

371
00:22:52,001 --> 00:22:55,240
how am I going to route a phone
cord without anybody noticing it?

372
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:59,380
And then finally it dawns on
me just get a cordless phone.

373
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,740
You can be anywhere in the school
and have access to the inner call.

374
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:08,380
So this point I recruit one of my buddies,
Mark Eisenhower, who looking back,

375
00:23:08,381 --> 00:23:12,190
probably wasn't the best accomplished for
this position because he played on the

376
00:23:12,191 --> 00:23:16,440
basketball team, was about six foot
four with bright blonde hair, right?

377
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,800
Not In conspicuous conspicuous at all.
Um,

378
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,420
and so we go,

379
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:27,870
we go to the school that weekend
and we have this grand plan that um,

380
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:30,303
we'll,

381
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:34,240
we'll maybe trick one of the janitors
until letting us into the main office.

382
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:39,840
And when he leaves somehow will like
plug in this cordless phone in school.

383
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:45,180
Um, it, it definitely was not a well
thought out plan at this point, but, um,

384
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,480
we didn't have a lot of times,
so we hit, we just went for it.

385
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:51,500
And so we went to the school,
it was on a Sunday afternoon,

386
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:56,450
I think the janitor saw right through us
do not let us in the office.

387
00:23:56,870 --> 00:24:01,370
And so we left a bit empty handed,
but we weren't given up.

388
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,600
This was too good.
So I employed another friend,

389
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,130
her name is Chelsea Hughes.

390
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:11,810
And so the three of us came up with a
better plan that we'd go up on a week, uh,

391
00:24:11,811 --> 00:24:13,220
on a, on a, on a weekend.

392
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:19,030
And there was a community school office
that we knew would be open on weekends

393
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:24,410
and that office connected like he's
inner chambers to the main office.

394
00:24:24,411 --> 00:24:27,200
And if we could just get into that one
we thought was you could go through the

395
00:24:27,201 --> 00:24:29,990
sequence of other doors to
get into the main office.

396
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:35,900
And so Chelsea went up and tried to
figure out where that principal was that

397
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:40,130
that um, community school
director. And so she,

398
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:44,240
she identified him on the far side
of campus. She signaled to mark,

399
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,530
mark signaled to me,

400
00:24:45,531 --> 00:24:50,531
and I'm outside in like a black Hoodie
with my backpack full of the phone,

401
00:24:50,631 --> 00:24:55,550
a flashlight. And mark gave me the
signal following Mr. Robot. Totally.

402
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:59,420
I go running in through the lobby of
the school right into this community

403
00:24:59,421 --> 00:25:03,680
director's office and then it's
pitch black and I'm, I'm like going,

404
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,090
going through all the doors.

405
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:08,150
It's like chamber by Chamber
until you get to the main office,

406
00:25:08,151 --> 00:25:10,190
the front desk I'm getting,

407
00:25:10,191 --> 00:25:14,090
I'm there and I moved the desk to the
side and there's this giant jumble of

408
00:25:14,091 --> 00:25:16,620
chords underneath it.
I'm trying to figure out which one,

409
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:19,130
what the hell is the phone line.
And then I trace it back to the wall.

410
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,620
I pull up the splitter piece,
I put it in,

411
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,670
and then I plug in the cordless phone
and the phone from the desk into the same

412
00:25:25,671 --> 00:25:26,504
line.

413
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:31,600
And I'm trying to bury the cord
base underneath the pile chords.

414
00:25:32,001 --> 00:25:35,810
And this point, I'm sweating, my
heart is racing. I'm like, oh my God.

415
00:25:35,811 --> 00:25:38,420
In the darkness of this office,
definitely not supposed to be there.

416
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:40,910
And all of a sudden there's
a tap on my shoulder.

417
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:46,420
My heart jumps a torn around it. It's more
like hovering over him. He goes, Joe, me,

418
00:25:46,421 --> 00:25:51,350
we got to go. Mr Choke is on his way.
And I'm like, all right, I'm done.

419
00:25:51,351 --> 00:25:55,130
So we pushed the desk back. We go out
the back entrance into the parking lot,

420
00:25:55,131 --> 00:25:57,980
we meet up with Chelsea,
I pulled the cordless phone out of my bag,

421
00:25:57,981 --> 00:26:02,730
I turned it on and we get a dial tone.
We have access to the intercom.

422
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:07,600
So the next question is what do
you do with that access? Right.

423
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,000
So the next day

424
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:17,710
I decided that I was going to make a tape
mix of different songs deploy over the

425
00:26:17,751 --> 00:26:21,380
intercom system and I play,

426
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:24,620
I put together a mix of pink Floyd.

427
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:29,800
We don't need no education and Alice
Cooper's schools out for summer and I

428
00:26:31,191 --> 00:26:34,820
haven't got so detailed
about this that I am.

429
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:38,450
I had my mom help out at home.
She didn't know she was helping me,

430
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,760
but we had two phone lines in the house,
went for their business,

431
00:26:40,761 --> 00:26:45,761
one for personal use and I would call
one phone line to the other and have the

432
00:26:46,501 --> 00:26:49,620
tape player next to it to figure
out the right volume on it,

433
00:26:49,621 --> 00:26:51,090
the right distance from the phone,

434
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:54,270
and have my mom on the other end and
telling me if it was loud enough or not.

435
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:59,490
She helped me calibrate the right uh,
the right volume for the tape player.

436
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,720
So the,
the phone is embedded.

437
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:08,370
Um, the tape makes tape, mixes is made.

438
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:14,330
It's now the last day of school and I
woke up that morning and I was nervous.

439
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:20,280
I'm like, ah, got to do this today.
All right. Prank is happening.

440
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:25,950
So I go to school a little bit
late on purpose. So as it works,

441
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,390
um,
I parked,

442
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:30,780
I parked my car in the parking lot
and in one pocket I've got the phone,

443
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,550
the other pocket, I've got this
tape player, I can't help it,

444
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:37,890
like on Sony Walkman and I'm
walking through the parking lot.

445
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:41,700
It's just just me, there's nobody
else. And then all of a sudden

446
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:47,460
our school police officer shows up on
his golf cart and he turns the corner and

447
00:27:47,461 --> 00:27:50,070
he's coming straight towards me
and there's nobody else around.

448
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:53,340
It's just him and me and he's coming at
me and I'm staring at him and I'm like,

449
00:27:53,341 --> 00:27:56,880
just be cool. Just be
cool. He doesn't know.

450
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:01,320
And like as you're getting closer to
my heart's racing faster and I'm like,

451
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,190
Oh my God,
I've got this,

452
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:05,700
the bolt is in my pocket of the phone
and the tape player and he makes eye

453
00:28:05,701 --> 00:28:09,520
contact. I mean the golf
cart goes by like, okay.

454
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:14,430
So I walked to the front of the school
and there's like this overhang area where

455
00:28:14,431 --> 00:28:19,170
the buses pulled up and um,
there's the benches and then the,

456
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:21,390
these glass doors before
you go into the main lobby.

457
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:25,620
And so everything's cleared
out except for this one kid,

458
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,290
he must've been like a freshman
or a sophomore or something.

459
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:31,890
And he's sitting there and
I'm like waiting for him to
leave cause I didn't want

460
00:28:31,891 --> 00:28:35,760
anybody to see what I was about
to do and he's not going anywhere.

461
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:38,880
And think to myself, I have to do this
now. Like I can't wait any longer.

462
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:42,210
So I just run up to him. I get
right in his face and I go, look,

463
00:28:42,211 --> 00:28:44,460
you can't say anything about
what you're about to see.

464
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,800
And he was just totally freaked
out. And he goes, oh, okay.

465
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:55,360
And so I go behind one of these, these
brick columns that was holding up the,

466
00:28:55,361 --> 00:29:00,310
the overhang and around the column you
could see into the glass doors and end

467
00:29:00,311 --> 00:29:03,040
where the officers were the phone basis.
So I pulled the phone out,

468
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,720
I pulled the tape player,
my hands are shaking and I'm like,

469
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:11,590
I'm just thinking stuff. All right,
let's go time. I turned the phone on,

470
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:15,700
get the dial tone, I hit pound zero,
zero. My hands are shaking even more.

471
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:17,410
I think this deep breath,

472
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,800
and actually this beep comes over
the whole school to signal there's an

473
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:25,801
announcement and I can
actually hear myself breathing
through the inner calm and

474
00:29:26,711 --> 00:29:31,010
I'm like, all right, this right
now say it playing the tape player.

475
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:33,590
I set the two down next to
each other and as I'm doing it,

476
00:29:33,591 --> 00:29:37,250
I flicked the volume all the way just
to be safe cause I'm thinking of itself.

477
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:40,010
I don't want to come across as too
soft and the volume. So I'm like,

478
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,530
I got to throw the volume the way up.

479
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:46,840
So I said to Tina next to each other
and I walk into the building and that's

480
00:29:46,841 --> 00:29:50,380
when all hell broke loose.
I opened the lobby,

481
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:55,770
I go into the lobby doors and the music
is blasting out of the intercom system.

482
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,520
Schools out full.

483
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:04,060
So it's like the speakers
are about to explode.

484
00:30:04,061 --> 00:30:08,890
It's like so freaking loud. And
um, when you get to school late,

485
00:30:08,891 --> 00:30:12,850
he had to go to like a checking line to
sign in. And so I'm in the checking line.

486
00:30:12,851 --> 00:30:14,950
There's like two people in
front of me and this is,

487
00:30:14,951 --> 00:30:17,520
this is the scene I'm in this like,
you know,

488
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:22,240
kind of high school lobby to
my left are all the offices,

489
00:30:22,241 --> 00:30:25,540
including the one where the phone
is to my right is the gymnasium,

490
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:30,340
add them gymnasium. Two of
my buddies combusting out
while this music's blasting.

491
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:33,250
They're laughing so hard because
they realize that it was me.

492
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:37,570
The coach comes out of the gym, starts
yelling at him, you get back in here.

493
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,700
We don't know what's going on.
What are you going to get back in here?

494
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,160
I'm just sitting there with a
straight face, not packing a smile.

495
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:47,800
I sign in and then to get to my class,
I have to walk past all these offices.

496
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,790
Right? And so while I'm doing
that, I hear what's going on.

497
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:54,610
They're yelling at each other. People were
sticking their head out of the office.

498
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:57,700
Who's it coming from in there? No, I
don't know where it's coming from there.

499
00:30:57,701 --> 00:30:58,810
I got the phone in their hands.

500
00:30:58,811 --> 00:31:02,320
You can hear all the Datacom then
hitting me like numbers on the phone,

501
00:31:02,321 --> 00:31:06,400
trying to shut it off. They had no
idea where the heck it was coming from.

502
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:11,530
And so as I'm walking past
these sequence of offices,

503
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:17,100
I catch a glimpse into the principal's
secretary office and then into the

504
00:31:18,941 --> 00:31:22,510
principal's office, which has
even a deeper layer. And I see,

505
00:31:22,511 --> 00:31:26,680
I catch her face and it's bright
red and she's yelling at somebody.

506
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:29,320
While this music's still playing it.
Right? Right now we're on to pink Floyd.

507
00:31:29,321 --> 00:31:34,321
At this point we don't need no education
and so I've just been going on,

508
00:31:36,821 --> 00:31:38,560
but it's like three,
four minutes.

509
00:31:38,561 --> 00:31:42,160
Then at this point I'm walking through my
classes in the very back of the campus.

510
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,870
I'm walking through the halls,

511
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:48,370
I'm totally by myself while the music's
playing and every time I walked past the

512
00:31:48,371 --> 00:31:48,761
classroom,

513
00:31:48,761 --> 00:31:51,670
there's a little skinny like glass window
and you can kind of get a glimpse into

514
00:31:51,671 --> 00:31:53,650
it.
And as I walked patsy classes,

515
00:31:53,651 --> 00:31:57,310
I take these double books and people are
like on top of their chairs and on top

516
00:31:57,311 --> 00:32:02,311
of their desks and people were dancing
and I get to my classroom right as the

517
00:32:04,211 --> 00:32:06,220
tape ends.
And look,

518
00:32:06,221 --> 00:32:09,040
I thought for sure they're going to
shut this off in like 20 seconds.

519
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,540
So I didn't make a tape very long.

520
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:13,390
It was like a couple minutes
and I need a and a tape.

521
00:32:13,391 --> 00:32:14,860
It probably would have
played for 20 minutes. Right.

522
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:18,460
So I get there right as a tape ends,
I opened the door.

523
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:21,910
People are staying on top of their desks.
People were dancing.

524
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,460
The teachers at her desk
with her head in her hands,

525
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:29,940
like totally lost control of her
class and it's like the record stops.

526
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:36,250
I walk in, everybody turns and looks at me
and goes, Joey was at you, and I'm like,

527
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:39,320
no, I don't know what that was. And so

528
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:42,920
finally the teacher gets
control of the class again.

529
00:32:42,921 --> 00:32:46,520
We sit down and everyone's looking
at me like, Oh wow, that was awesome.

530
00:32:46,521 --> 00:32:49,700
What was that? I'm like, I
don't know. I don't know.

531
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:51,860
And so not two minutes later,

532
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:56,840
there's a knock on the door
and administrator walks in.

533
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:00,410
She walks over to the teacher,
the class goes dead silent.

534
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:03,590
They whisper something to each other
and then they both turn and look at me.

535
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:08,000
The administrator comes by my desk.
She goes, Joey, get your stuff.

536
00:33:08,001 --> 00:33:11,420
You're coming with me. And I'm like
seeking him. Desole I'm like, oh no.

537
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:15,380
She gets outside. She slams the door,
we're in the hallway and she goes,

538
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,500
you want to tell me what's happened
to back there? I go, I don't know.

539
00:33:18,501 --> 00:33:20,510
You're talking about, she's like,
we've got mark in the office.

540
00:33:20,511 --> 00:33:22,440
We know what happened and I'm like,
I don't,

541
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:24,980
I don't know what you're talking about.
And she goes, you can make this hard,

542
00:33:24,981 --> 00:33:28,600
you can make this easy on
yourself. When I was like, ah.

543
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:34,190
So we walk all the way back to the front
of the campus and the whole way she's

544
00:33:34,191 --> 00:33:35,001
berating me,

545
00:33:35,001 --> 00:33:39,560
chewing my head off of all the damages
that I caused and all the issues that

546
00:33:39,561 --> 00:33:41,660
were created with the phone system.

547
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:46,720
And we go to the secretary's office and
we walk through and I see mark there and

548
00:33:47,601 --> 00:33:51,620
he's got his head in his hands. And
Mark is, you're very tall, very tall,

549
00:33:51,621 --> 00:33:54,880
very blonde, very blonde, very
obvious accomplice. Yes, yes he was.

550
00:33:54,881 --> 00:33:56,450
He was a good buddy and a good friend.

551
00:33:56,810 --> 00:34:01,600
And I appreciate his help in
this endeavor. And so he's,

552
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:02,660
he's down like this.

553
00:34:02,661 --> 00:34:07,661
He's like totally crushed and he sees
me and he looks at me and he goes,

554
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:11,000
and I couldn't tell what he was saying.

555
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:13,190
So it's just trying to mouth
the words analysis of the to me.

556
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:17,690
And so what are you saying?
He goes, it was the janitor.

557
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:23,120
So we get through the secretary
office into the principal's office,

558
00:34:23,121 --> 00:34:25,550
Connie quarterly.
Never forget her name.

559
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:30,530
They slammed the door and I'm staying
there with my backpack or in a green izod

560
00:34:30,531 --> 00:34:31,760
shirt.
I will never forget this.

561
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:37,420
I mean my brown khaki pants and a green
izod shirt with my backpack and there's

562
00:34:38,601 --> 00:34:43,601
Connie quarterly at her desk with their
arms like this kind of huffing and

563
00:34:43,671 --> 00:34:45,560
puffing face is bright red.

564
00:34:45,561 --> 00:34:50,090
She's got the phone and the tape player
and the phone cord and the phone base on

565
00:34:50,091 --> 00:34:53,690
her desk and around her
or the 20 administrators,

566
00:34:53,691 --> 00:34:55,040
including the school police officer.

567
00:34:55,041 --> 00:34:57,020
It's the biggest school in the state
of Georgia. We had on a police officer.

568
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:02,000
And so they're all like this, like arms
crossed, huffing and puffing, right?

569
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:06,290
And I'm like, Oh fuck. Like
what? Heart's racing. I'm like,

570
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:10,100
what is going on here?
Every one of them took a turn,

571
00:35:10,101 --> 00:35:13,670
it may just to yell at me about something.
Connie coy starts the army.

572
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:17,330
How did you get to the office?
You broken energy and she's like,

573
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:20,780
like really angry. And I'm like, ah, like,

574
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:24,320
like I'm starting to feel a
little bit bad about this. Like,

575
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:29,110
like I'm not sure what this
is going to go. Like is this,

576
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,970
am I going to get off on this? Or like,
oh there's some consequences here.

577
00:35:31,971 --> 00:35:32,804
I have no idea.

578
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:38,740
And so from that they lead us
into this like negotiation room,

579
00:35:39,931 --> 00:35:43,080
which I've never seen.
It was this long wooden table,

580
00:35:43,081 --> 00:35:47,280
but he's like leather chairs are on the
whole side of principal corlies at the

581
00:35:47,281 --> 00:35:49,740
head of the table. Mark and I are
now senior across from each other.

582
00:35:49,741 --> 00:35:51,870
We get administrators standing
over us with their arms crossed,

583
00:35:51,871 --> 00:35:53,400
like we're going to make
a run for it or something.

584
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:58,930
And she likes charts like
negotiating with us. And um,

585
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:03,260
this is the part that it actually pissed
me off the most is that she started to

586
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:06,870
threaten our scholarships and she looked
at marsh, she goes, mark, you know,

587
00:36:06,871 --> 00:36:09,970
I know you've got,
I'm a basketball scholarship to this,

588
00:36:09,971 --> 00:36:11,400
the school in Georgia that you go into.

589
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:13,350
I hate to have to call the
coach and tell him about this,

590
00:36:13,351 --> 00:36:15,240
this incident she gives me,
cause Joey,

591
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,340
I know you're going to that
art school in Rhode Island.

592
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,520
I hate to have to call the admissions
office and tell them about this incident.

593
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,800
And that point I was like,

594
00:36:22,801 --> 00:36:26,490
there's no way you're getting in the
way of either of our dreams because we

595
00:36:26,491 --> 00:36:28,820
tapped into the high school in
your home system. Like right.

596
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:33,260
So she made an offer, she goes, um,

597
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:35,390
we could press charges for breaking,

598
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,040
entering and tampering and school
property and some other things.

599
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:43,730
Or you can do this list
of things which included,

600
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:48,450
um, wiping down computer screens and the
library, you know, during the summertime,

601
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:52,500
um, ironically setting up and taking
down the sound equipment for graduation.

602
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:57,910
I like if you were the chores and
like manual labor basically. Um,

603
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,130
and so mark and I, obviously we say, well,

604
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:06,750
we'll do the chores and the need of
labor so that we can graduate pressing

605
00:37:06,751 --> 00:37:10,110
charges somehow equated to not being
able to graduate and get your diploma.

606
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:16,250
And so from there we go into the
school police officers office.

607
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:22,380
His name was officer Harrelson and it's
a good cop. Now this guy. Yeah, right.

608
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:27,340
This guy had the deepest kind of grizzly
voice that you could imagine a office

609
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:29,760
officer Harrolson here.
Brookwood high school.

610
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,540
So we're in the office and he
calls her parents and this is,

611
00:37:33,541 --> 00:37:35,700
this is like probably where the
worst part of the whole story.

612
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:42,170
He did not know the update that we
opted in to do the manual labor.

613
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:46,800
He thinks that we're not graduating high
school now, so he calls my mom. He goes,

614
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:50,430
Miss [inaudible]. This is officer
Harrelson here at Brookwood high school.

615
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:54,880
Yes ma'am. I've got your, your son in
custody here. Yeah. Yes. Right man,

616
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:58,130
it doesn't look like he's graduating
this year. Oh No. Yeah man.

617
00:37:58,131 --> 00:38:02,070
And he's right here. He hands me the phone
and I heard this tone of voice in my,

618
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:05,310
from my mom. I've never heard since.
I never everyone here again. She goes,

619
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:08,760
you could ride home after school.
I can't believe you click.

620
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,590
I'm like Mamba League.
We're going to graduate.

621
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:15,930
So she thinks her son's not
graduating high school. Um, I'm like,

622
00:38:15,931 --> 00:38:18,910
thanks officer house and it
was really kind of view, um,

623
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:24,540
and does the same thing at the mark and
we're walking out of his office and this

624
00:38:24,541 --> 00:38:28,960
is the best part. He pulls us to
the side and he goes, Mark Joey,

625
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:34,920
I've been at the school for over 20 years
and you need to know that was the best

626
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:35,830
damn prank I've ever seen.

627
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:46,900
Officer Harrelson. So we
go through graduation. Um,

628
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:48,640
one little funny spent Levy does it,
you know,

629
00:38:48,641 --> 00:38:53,641
he had your honors cords and a different
club cores that you were on your neck.

630
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:58,240
Mark and I were phone cords
to honor the it senior prank.

631
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:02,740
People were raving about it. Um, and we
came back, you know, two weeks later,

632
00:39:02,741 --> 00:39:07,510
did you wipe computer screens in
the library? And I'll never forget,

633
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:09,610
we're outside on meet the same overhang,

634
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:14,760
like dusting off our rags and all these
buses pull up and all these bus drivers

635
00:39:15,161 --> 00:39:19,090
start pouring into the school passed it.
So it has like some bus driver, you know,

636
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,590
end of year celebration or something.

637
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:23,980
And one of the bus drivers actually
walks over to us and she goes,

638
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:26,060
are you the two boys?

639
00:39:26,061 --> 00:39:29,230
It pulled that prank with the intercom
system and mark and I looked at each

640
00:39:29,231 --> 00:39:33,240
other and we're like, yeah.
She goes, you know, you are,

641
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:37,390
you two are our lens in this
county. And Morgan are like, what?

642
00:39:37,391 --> 00:39:38,650
Like how did they hear about it?

643
00:39:38,651 --> 00:39:41,540
Like all the bus drivers and
the county that we moved in.

644
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:44,830
So,
um,

645
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:49,360
it was this incredible
moment of having an idea.

646
00:39:49,361 --> 00:39:53,170
I have this ambition to do something
that was original. In this case,

647
00:39:53,171 --> 00:39:55,180
there was no property damage.
Nobody got hurt,

648
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:58,940
which is to me the essence
of a great prank. And, um,

649
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:02,680
that was part one of the story,
part one of the story.

650
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,820
Well, all right, I'll bite. I'll fight.

651
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:11,600
What's part two of the story?
It's a part to the story. Um,

652
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,473
I'm in college,

653
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:18,720
this is about two years later and one of
my roommates comes home one day and he

654
00:40:20,201 --> 00:40:24,940
says, Hey, have you heard of that
show? It's on MTV. It's called, um,

655
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:30,310
uh, high school stories, pranks
in controversies. And I go,

656
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:32,820
no, no. It was about, he's like,
yeah, I was, I was just watching it.

657
00:40:32,821 --> 00:40:36,280
It's like they showed this,
this, uh, some high school,

658
00:40:36,281 --> 00:40:40,620
they had this high school was prank. I was
like, I sat up in my chair. I go, really?

659
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:45,400
You tell me about that? And he goes,
yeah, they film these guys who get this.

660
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:49,360
They super glued the locks on the doors
of this high school. And I'm like,

661
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,280
you have to be kidding me.

662
00:40:51,281 --> 00:40:54,160
The oldest trick in the book [inaudible]
making a show about high school pranks

663
00:40:54,161 --> 00:40:57,190
and they're doing a super glue
in the Loc Prank. I'm like,

664
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:58,870
I have to get in touch with the producer.

665
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:04,620
So I get online and I tracked down the
producer of the show and I sent them an

666
00:41:05,441 --> 00:41:09,670
email that was a teaser of the story,
but not the full one. And basically said,

667
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:11,920
if you wanna hear the rest of it,
here's my phone number.

668
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,670
Probably about 30 minutes later, my
phone rings for the 200, two area code.

669
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:20,800
And when I see NYC and I get on the
phone with this producer and he's like,

670
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:23,770
I really intrigued by your email,
are always looking for good stories.

671
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:25,570
What does it,
what he got?

672
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:30,100
And I told them the abbreviated version
of what you just heard. And he's like, oh,

673
00:41:30,101 --> 00:41:32,890
I love this. I'm gonna Pitch
this to my executive producer.

674
00:41:32,891 --> 00:41:33,740
We're to get back to you.

675
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:37,790
It's about three or four days later you
get another phone call from a t one two

676
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,930
hey, this is Leslie from MTV.
I'm the executive producer here.

677
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,470
Really loved your story.
Want to hear more about it from you.

678
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:48,920
So by the end of the call, she's in
love with the story and she's like,

679
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:52,280
you know what we're going to do? We're
going to send a crew down to Georgia.

680
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:53,630
We want you to come back this summer.

681
00:41:53,631 --> 00:41:58,220
We're going to reenact the whole thing
and included in the next season of a TV

682
00:41:58,221 --> 00:42:03,080
show. So that summer we got to go back
to Georgia and reenact the whole thing.

683
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:05,690
Now, however, this is
only two years later,

684
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:08,570
the same administration and
principal is still there.

685
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:10,550
And they did not have a lot of friction.

686
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,990
I was going to say the wounds
have healed over quite yet.

687
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:17,160
Definitely not healed. They
definitely had a grudge. Um,

688
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:21,100
because if anything we just
embarrass them like right.

689
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:25,010
They had no idea how to
turn it off. I'm like, yeah,

690
00:42:25,011 --> 00:42:27,060
there's no damage or anything that
was really done that's permit.

691
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:31,640
And so they declined reenacting a school.

692
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:35,420
So ironically went to one of my rival
high schools and refilm the whole thing

693
00:42:35,421 --> 00:42:39,270
there. And even more ironic is that
the principal, the new principal there,

694
00:42:39,271 --> 00:42:41,570
it was a former administrator when
I pulled a prank at my other school.

695
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:44,960
So he was intubated, familiar what
had happened at that point. He was,

696
00:42:44,961 --> 00:42:49,450
he could laugh about it. Um, so that
summer we reenacted the whole thing. Um,

697
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:52,820
Chelsea and mark and I got a couple
of their friends to be extras in the

698
00:42:52,821 --> 00:42:55,540
background and it aired later that year.
And MTV.

699
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:56,543
Amazing.

700
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:02,840
So it seems like your brushes with
mischief just seemed to reinforce your

701
00:43:02,881 --> 00:43:07,881
appetite for mischief of sorts in a way.

702
00:43:08,310 --> 00:43:09,143
Perhaps.

703
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:14,340
Perhaps now when we were
hanging out earlier today,

704
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:20,410
I ask a question that that I often ask
of friends I'm going to sit down with and

705
00:43:20,701 --> 00:43:24,480
it was in effect.
Can you give me any cues?

706
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:25,770
I don't want to hear the story,

707
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:31,010
but can you give me any cues that might
lead to a fun discussion and and one of

708
00:43:32,041 --> 00:43:32,821
them I said,

709
00:43:32,821 --> 00:43:36,990
I don't want to know the story because
I want to hear it fresh and when we're

710
00:43:36,991 --> 00:43:41,991
recording and one of them was NBA time
worked with or in NBA and I have no idea

711
00:43:47,341 --> 00:43:51,030
what this refers to,
but that's a cue.

712
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:55,850
Tim. I think this story starts
by telling you a fun fact.

713
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,610
I seen Michael Jordan naked in person.

714
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:03,630
Okay, this is a good start.
Now we're talking about

715
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:08,970
locking room, hotel room barbecue. My job,

716
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:14,020
I had a high school job where I worked
as a ball boy in the NBA for the Atlanta

717
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:18,430
Hawks and that was my job in high
school. Okay. I love basketball.

718
00:44:18,431 --> 00:44:22,270
I played my whole life
and I was reading these,

719
00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:26,710
I used to read the newspaper every morning
when I was growing up over breakfast,

720
00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:30,560
whatever. I would just consume
the newspaper. And so, um,

721
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:35,580
one day I'm in the sports section and
there's an article about a bat being bat

722
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:39,030
boys for the Atlanta Braves and being
ball boys for the Atlanta Hawks.

723
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:42,570
At the very end of the article it said,
if you're interested in becoming one,

724
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:47,970
send a letter about yourself to this
address. And I'm like, oh my God. Yes.

725
00:44:47,971 --> 00:44:51,660
Like that would be so cool.
Right? So I send a letter,

726
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:54,540
but actually I sent it on
the day of the deadline

727
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:59,820
once it passed and I sent them the day
of the deadline and I kind of forgot

728
00:44:59,821 --> 00:45:04,821
about it until that next summer I get
a phone call and this guy introduced

729
00:45:06,571 --> 00:45:07,650
himself as Chris Tucker,

730
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:11,280
the strength of the head strength
coach of the Atlanta Hawks.

731
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:15,180
And he goes, yeah, we got your
letter and we really liked it.

732
00:45:15,181 --> 00:45:17,110
We want you to come down to
interview for one of our board,

733
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:21,750
our ball ballboy positions. I go, this is
awesome. I'll be there. So we get down to,

734
00:45:21,751 --> 00:45:25,710
um, at the time it was a the Omni, um,

735
00:45:25,711 --> 00:45:29,930
but for the head Philips arena and
I'm interviewing with them, you know,

736
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:34,680
tell them about my life and my love for
basketball and these things and I get a

737
00:45:34,681 --> 00:45:38,210
call back a few days later
that I got the job. So this,

738
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:42,960
I'm like a freshman in high school,
right? I'm like barely like 16, maybe 15.

739
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:48,150
I'm 15 years old and I start working,
you know,

740
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:53,070
in the locker rooms of the Atlanta hawks.
And actually my very first game,

741
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:58,580
I'll never forget this was the hawks
versus the Toronto Raptors and they threw

742
00:46:00,601 --> 00:46:01,191
me onto the,

743
00:46:01,191 --> 00:46:04,560
the visitors because the ball boys
for the home team and the business.

744
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:08,410
Can you explain what a ballboy doesn't
basketball because I'm an idiot when it

745
00:46:08,411 --> 00:46:10,510
comes to group sports or team sports.

746
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:13,980
I know the ball boy or
ball girl does in tennis,

747
00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:16,060
but in basketball I have no idea.
It's a bad,

748
00:46:16,090 --> 00:46:17,980
there's different tiers
right at the entry level.

749
00:46:17,981 --> 00:46:19,780
Tier is you're wiping
the sweat on the fort.

750
00:46:19,781 --> 00:46:22,770
When a player falls down in the
middle of the game, all right, right.

751
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:27,870
People go out with the mop and the
towel and you're just wiping the sweat.

752
00:46:27,871 --> 00:46:31,640
So the players and slip on the court,
it's like the entry level position.

753
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:34,710
And I did plenty of that. Um, as
you work your way up the tier,

754
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:38,910
then you work on the side of the court
and you'd actually run and grab the

755
00:46:38,911 --> 00:46:42,670
players, warm up pants and jacket.
When they went to check into the games,

756
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:46,020
he'd be at half of like sitting on a
half court with them and you can't have a

757
00:46:46,021 --> 00:46:47,960
towel when they came in,
you know,

758
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:51,420
sit back down on the bench and then the
next year was he'd worked behind the

759
00:46:51,421 --> 00:46:53,340
bench and actually assist the trainer.

760
00:46:53,370 --> 00:46:55,700
And so you'd be handing the Gatorade
over their shoulder. Oh, cool.

761
00:46:55,710 --> 00:46:58,220
And they sit down and give him the towel,
get them their, their, their warm up,

762
00:46:58,340 --> 00:46:59,760
their, uh, their jacket with a Hoodie.

763
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:05,130
And then the highest level was doing that
for the visiting team. Right. And so,

764
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:08,670
um, and whatever they needed to set
up the locker room before the game.

765
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:10,740
You've run any errands that
need to get done, you break the,

766
00:47:10,741 --> 00:47:12,300
lock him down at the end of the game,
the whole thing.

767
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:17,240
So you get to the game like three
hours early and do all this. Um,

768
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:18,930
you end up running
errands for the players.

769
00:47:18,931 --> 00:47:22,230
Sometimes you'd be like a nice
tip or horse grant one time,

770
00:47:22,231 --> 00:47:24,840
give me a hundred dollar bill, it's
a big deal. Take us back to the bus.

771
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:28,590
And it was pretty cool.
And so they threw me my very first game.

772
00:47:28,591 --> 00:47:32,890
They throw me to the visitors side,
Toronto Raptors, tar afters. And um,

773
00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:36,670
it was my first experience, right of
like being around some amia greats.

774
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:40,960
Marcus Camby. I remember it was on the
team at the time. This guy watched play,

775
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:45,630
uh, at Umass in college and
like really admired and um,

776
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:47,453
uh,

777
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:51,790
it was my first exposure to
professional sports locker room too.

778
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:55,240
And everybody comes in and they just
take the clothes off to get changed in.

779
00:47:55,241 --> 00:47:59,240
Like nobody gives a shit. It doesn't
matter at the end of the day. Um,

780
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:01,050
but for me it was like,
Whoa, Whoa, whoa. Where am I?

781
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:05,140
Lots of negative pressure athletes.
It was my first experience. Of course,

782
00:48:05,141 --> 00:48:09,590
you get used to that. It's no big
deal at a certain point. Um, so I'm,

783
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:12,100
I'm in the MBA and I did
it for three seasons.

784
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:16,780
I got to work alongside the Lenny Wilkins,
the head coach to Kevin Mutombo,

785
00:48:16,781 --> 00:48:20,760
Steve Smith, uh, some
of these NBA greats. Um,

786
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:25,300
and there were some really incredible
moments that happen. Um, one of them,

787
00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:31,900
one of them was when the hawks
played the Chicago Bulls.

788
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:36,800
Jordan's still playing. This is 1999, um,

789
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:40,480
one of his last seasons. And, um,

790
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:42,580
I'll never forget this,

791
00:48:42,850 --> 00:48:47,780
so you have to imagine the scene
ruin Philips arena and, uh,

792
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:51,280
the hawks are actually winning,
which is amazing.

793
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:56,800
And the place is going nuts. You can't
even hear yourself think it's so loud.

794
00:48:56,801 --> 00:49:00,700
People are screaming. They're, they're
playing music over the loud speakers.

795
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,450
And I'm working the bowls
bench, right? Which is like,

796
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:09,300
you've got Scottie Pippin and Steve
Kerr, Dennis Rodman, uh, Michael Jackson,

797
00:49:10,330 --> 00:49:12,840
Phil Jackson, Michael
Jordan, like the whole,

798
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:18,100
the whole rostered help rostered and
some work in the bowls bench there down.

799
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:23,460
Phil Jackson called a timeout and the
place goes nuts because the hawks are up

800
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:29,200
and in front of me.
Jordan pops down Rodman's on the left.

801
00:49:29,230 --> 00:49:31,510
Pippins on the right.
Phil Jackson.

802
00:49:31,511 --> 00:49:36,040
It's like right here and he's furious.

803
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:39,640
Like this guy's using xsplit as like
you'd never believe he's yelling things.

804
00:49:39,641 --> 00:49:43,210
I feel like I can feel his soul
like his spit, like hitting my face.

805
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:45,400
He's just like,
and I'm like right behind Jordan.

806
00:49:45,401 --> 00:49:48,790
He's right here and the places again,
so loud,

807
00:49:48,791 --> 00:49:52,390
people screaming at the top of their
lungs and um, I'm doing my job right.

808
00:49:52,391 --> 00:49:55,930
I give the guys a towel and then I'm
getting the Gatorade. So I'm like,

809
00:49:55,931 --> 00:49:58,390
I'm going to start with Jordan.
Obviously he's right in front of me.

810
00:49:58,690 --> 00:50:03,020
So I reached around. I,
you're on this side. Um,

811
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:06,250
so left, left hand, like over the
shoulder, left hand over the shoulder.

812
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:09,670
Jordan is facing this way, talking
to pip and who's right next to him.

813
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:15,400
I reached around and Rodman,
who is to my left,

814
00:50:16,870 --> 00:50:19,330
turns quickly bumps my elbow.

815
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:23,470
The Gatorade quickly goes upside
down and straight into Jordan's lap.

816
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:29,030
There were only few in my life.
I've been as terrified as that moment.

817
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:34,550
Phil Jackson's yelling at me,
Michael Jordan spins around and he goes,

818
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:38,230
hey man, watch it. And I'm like,
oh my God, like my heart's racing.

819
00:50:38,231 --> 00:50:41,270
I'm like Jesus Christ. So I did what
anybody would do in that moment.

820
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:43,880
If you spill something,
you tend to wipe it up.

821
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:47,990
So I grabbed the towel and I'm
patting down Jordan's thigh.

822
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:50,810
Like now I'm like in the huddle,
right?

823
00:50:51,470 --> 00:50:54,740
Rodman's laughing at me because he
realized what he'd done had done.

824
00:50:55,310 --> 00:50:59,000
Phil Jackson's like right
here, like spitting. He's
yelling so hard and I'm like,

825
00:50:59,001 --> 00:50:59,781
I'm sorry Jordan.

826
00:50:59,781 --> 00:51:04,280
I'm like trying to like dry as leg up
with his Gatorade spill that went right to

827
00:51:04,281 --> 00:51:08,830
his lap and oh man, I'm like
sweating profusely. Right?

828
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:12,540
Cause like you're going to get like the
TV crews are like in the huddle to the

829
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:13,520
camera's in your face.

830
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:18,440
It's like high stress
moment as a ball boy.

831
00:51:19,190 --> 00:51:21,530
And so are you had one job.

832
00:51:22,810 --> 00:51:25,100
Don't pour the Gatorade on Jordan's balls.

833
00:51:25,130 --> 00:51:30,130
Well obviously unfortunately Robin and
made that quick spin knocked me not your

834
00:51:30,861 --> 00:51:33,820
fault. So I'm like, the,

835
00:51:33,821 --> 00:51:36,350
the buzzer goes off and it's like time
to get back on the court and I'm still

836
00:51:36,351 --> 00:51:40,340
like patting down like Jordan's
leg and he's like, oh, come on man,

837
00:51:41,710 --> 00:51:44,000
get up.
And um,

838
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:47,750
I think right after that he actually
had like a whole bunch of points.

839
00:51:48,570 --> 00:51:50,150
He three on the slam dunk or something.
I think

840
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:55,910
the moral of the story there
is a, you know, when he,

841
00:51:55,911 --> 00:51:58,760
when I spill Gatorade on Jordan,
make sure you clean it up.

842
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:03,470
What it seems like there's
another pattern here,

843
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:05,360
which is

844
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:12,080
getting comfortable with
uncomfortable situations.

845
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:16,920
Right? Or exposing yourself
to discomfort. Yeah.

846
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:21,110
So that you're comfortable
sphere of action expands. Right.

847
00:52:21,970 --> 00:52:24,460
Uh,
what,

848
00:52:24,650 --> 00:52:27,950
what was your next brush once you get
to visit these, you're in [inaudible].

849
00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:33,500
Were there any formative
entrepreneurial experiences

850
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:36,110
that come to mind?

851
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:37,413
Absolutely.
Were.

852
00:52:39,150 --> 00:52:44,020
And I, she'd explain also if I may
interject just for a second that, okay.

853
00:52:44,530 --> 00:52:49,530
One of the reasons I wanted to explore
a lot of these stories is that it's easy

854
00:52:50,770 --> 00:52:54,820
and I think typical for people to take
a single chapter in someone's life and

855
00:52:54,821 --> 00:52:59,470
isolate it and view it as the whole story.
Right?

856
00:52:59,471 --> 00:53:04,330
But there's so much backstory and so
much development and so many experiences

857
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:09,370
that lead up to the small piece of the
puzzle that people tend to think is the

858
00:53:09,371 --> 00:53:13,640
whole puzzle. Right? Right. So just for
people listening and watching, that's,

859
00:53:13,670 --> 00:53:16,450
that's, and I just enjoy
your storytelling. So
that's another piece of it.

860
00:53:18,130 --> 00:53:22,840
But the [inaudible], right. So
this is, this is a level up,

861
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:25,380
I mean risky, you have a lot of
talented people are his name,

862
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:27,120
uh,

863
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:31,590
any entrepreneurial memories or
experiments that come to mind from risky?

864
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:34,620
Yes. So I decided to go to
busy, to study fine arts,

865
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:38,400
to be a painter and I didn't
really know what that meant.

866
00:53:38,430 --> 00:53:40,650
I had this vision of maybe one day,
you know,

867
00:53:40,890 --> 00:53:44,670
being able to exhibit in New York or
something, like do the gallery scene.

868
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:47,390
I couldn't actually picture it, but, um,

869
00:53:47,550 --> 00:53:52,110
really wanted to go to study art and
painting. So when I got to campus,

870
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:57,180
they have this week of orientation and
you get your class schedule and you get

871
00:53:57,181 --> 00:53:59,250
to meet upperclassmen.
And um,

872
00:53:59,270 --> 00:54:02,610
some talking to this
guy and fellow students,

873
00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:04,980
fellow fell student upperclassmen
and he's saying, Oh,

874
00:54:04,981 --> 00:54:06,390
who do you have for your courses?

875
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:11,160
And freshman year they give you the
foundation stuff like drawing two

876
00:54:11,161 --> 00:54:14,250
dimensional design, three dimensional
design, liberal arts, art history,

877
00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:16,440
and some going through
the list of teachers.

878
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:20,130
And I say this one teacher's name
that makes his eyebrows go up.

879
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:24,840
I go,
I've got Gareth Jones for three d.

880
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:30,390
And he goes, you've got
Gareth Jones. Oh Man.

881
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:33,150
I go, what is it, what it
is, this guy? And he goes,

882
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:37,470
just wait for the chess set project.
And I go, what's the Jess said project?

883
00:54:37,530 --> 00:54:38,760
And he goes,
you'll see.

884
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:44,690
So my very first class is with this Guy
Gareth Jones teaching three dimensional

885
00:54:44,851 --> 00:54:49,530
design. And picture this, we're in this
art studio with these concrete fours.

886
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:54,510
He's like rickety metal stools,
plaster covered kind of work surfaces.

887
00:54:54,511 --> 00:54:58,680
It's a little bit cold, it's
September, New England. And you know,

888
00:54:58,681 --> 00:55:02,880
it's a very first class. And I'm
sitting around with 18 other freshmen,

889
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:06,150
we're all trying to make sense of
where we are in the world and what this

890
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:07,320
thing's all about.

891
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:10,890
And this is about to be our first
impression of what does it like to be a

892
00:55:10,891 --> 00:55:11,724
student at risky.

893
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:17,660
And so we're sitting there and all of a
sudden this guy wearing all black with

894
00:55:18,991 --> 00:55:23,991
this big poofy had a hair comes out and
he stands in front of us and he's got

895
00:55:27,451 --> 00:55:30,030
this Welsh accent and he goes,

896
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:36,620
I just want you all to know that half of
you are going to fail my costs because

897
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:41,550
he won't finish the chess set project.
I don't think it's off.

898
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:45,150
Oh my God,
that's what this is going to be like here.

899
00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:47,940
Like half the people I with my left,
I looked to my right,

900
00:55:47,941 --> 00:55:51,990
one of them is going to be gone because
going to fail out. I'm like, oh my God.

901
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:54,480
And we're all looking at each
other like is he serious?

902
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:58,050
And he goes on to explain
the chess at project.

903
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:00,960
And so in addition to
your weekly assignments,

904
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:05,250
the chest at project is this semester
long project that takes place outside of

905
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:09,870
the classroom on your own time where
you have to choose a three dimensional

906
00:56:09,871 --> 00:56:10,281
artist,

907
00:56:10,281 --> 00:56:15,281
like a sculptor like Henry
Moore and architect like
Frank Lloyd Wright furniture

908
00:56:15,481 --> 00:56:20,220
designer, a fashion designer, and
you had to find a book about them.

909
00:56:21,390 --> 00:56:26,390
And from that you had to select of their
work to recreate and you did it in the

910
00:56:27,011 --> 00:56:28,210
format of a chess set,

911
00:56:28,570 --> 00:56:30,790
which means it didn't have to
look like actual chess set pieces,

912
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:36,030
but you take one of their creations and
replicated eight times for your pond and

913
00:56:36,701 --> 00:56:38,410
had to look exactly like
the picture in the book.

914
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:42,070
You took another one of their creations
and yet her replicate twice for the

915
00:56:42,071 --> 00:56:46,840
rooks in three d in three d and Yet
to do it at 12 inch scale God and just

916
00:56:46,841 --> 00:56:49,330
looking at a picture,
you'd figure out what it's made of,

917
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:51,550
what's the backside look like,
what's the underside of the like?

918
00:56:52,090 --> 00:56:55,420
And at this time I had a
growing interest in furniture,

919
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:57,153
furniture design.

920
00:56:57,970 --> 00:57:01,420
And I came across this furniture
designer from the 1920s and thirties,

921
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:06,020
named Garrett Rietveld. He was a
Dutch architect and designer. Um,

922
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:10,660
and he did these really beautiful chairs
that are actually in the museum of

923
00:57:10,661 --> 00:57:14,740
Modern Art. They're classics.
And I thought a couple of things.

924
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:18,070
One is, as I got to know Gareth
Jones, the professor room,

925
00:57:18,190 --> 00:57:21,190
it became very clear that this
guy was super opinionated.

926
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:24,220
He would argue to the death to
make sure that he was always right.

927
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:28,990
I would watch him like,
just are you students? Like,

928
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:32,410
like relentlessly to make his point.

929
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:34,660
And out of that,

930
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:38,570
I just had this growing thinking of like,
wow,

931
00:57:38,571 --> 00:57:40,600
like I'd love to prove this
guy wrong at some point.

932
00:57:42,910 --> 00:57:44,440
And so,
um,

933
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:49,090
I also thought I'm going to
throw myself into this project.

934
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:52,180
There's no way I'm
failing. In fact, I wanna,

935
00:57:52,270 --> 00:57:55,900
I wanna I want to complete this project
and if I'm going to commit so much of my

936
00:57:55,901 --> 00:57:59,970
time to this and I'm going to make
chairs from this designer Garrett,

937
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:04,000
refilled at the end of it, I want to
come out with something I can use.

938
00:58:04,001 --> 00:58:07,930
I don't want 12 inch chairs.
I actually want full functional chairs.

939
00:58:08,590 --> 00:58:11,830
And so I'm like, this is a really great
idea. I'm going to share this with Gareth.

940
00:58:12,550 --> 00:58:15,040
So I call him over and I'm like,
Gareth,

941
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:17,200
I want to make full
size functional chairs.

942
00:58:17,890 --> 00:58:21,310
And My expectation at this time
was that he's going to, you know,

943
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:23,740
give me a high five and say,
Joe, you can do it. You got this,

944
00:58:23,741 --> 00:58:28,120
I believe in you instead,
Tim. He goes, Joe,

945
00:58:28,210 --> 00:58:32,440
I really don't think you can do it.
Really focus on the smallest scale.

946
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:38,140
And he walks away and I'm like,
no fucking way.

947
00:58:38,170 --> 00:58:41,800
Like, all right buddy, now you really
have to do it right. All right pal.

948
00:58:41,801 --> 00:58:45,870
Like you just lit every fire that you
needed a light. We forgot how to do this.

949
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:48,310
The thing is I didn't know
how the hell to make a chair.

950
00:58:49,610 --> 00:58:53,170
I've never worked with wood before.
I never heard power tools like,

951
00:58:53,230 --> 00:58:56,980
like actual machine shop tools.
And um,

952
00:58:57,010 --> 00:59:01,060
I was really stepping into unknown on this
and I had a semester to figure it out.

953
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:04,600
So I just committed every,

954
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:07,700
all of my time to making this
project happen on, on weekends,

955
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:11,830
Saturday nights my friends would be going
out to parties on campus and I was in

956
00:59:11,831 --> 00:59:13,270
the studio trying to figure
out how to make chairs.

957
00:59:14,530 --> 00:59:18,670
And so I started by going to the
furniture department and talking to

958
00:59:18,671 --> 00:59:23,671
upperclassmen and actually sat with the
head of the furniture department name is

959
00:59:23,901 --> 00:59:24,800
Rosanne Somerson.

960
00:59:25,310 --> 00:59:28,850
And I told her about my ambitions and she
looked at me with kind of a crazy face.

961
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,740
It's like,
you're never going to figure this out.

962
00:59:30,741 --> 00:59:35,180
But she was encouraging and she pointed
me to some upperclassmen who then

963
00:59:35,181 --> 00:59:38,390
started help me understand wood
and machines and the tools,

964
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:42,200
table saws and band saws and leads in the
things that you need to make furniture.

965
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:48,350
And so piece by piece I started to
figure out how to make these chairs I was

966
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:51,020
sourcing would, I had access to
the shop that they were giving me.

967
00:59:51,710 --> 00:59:55,410
And the thing is I never told
Gareth where it was in the projects.

968
00:59:55,610 --> 00:59:59,470
So every check in and be like how's
it coming? I'm like, it's all right.

969
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:01,490
And I would downplay my progress.

970
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:05,180
Meanwhile in my dorm room is starting
to fill up with these chairs everywhere.

971
01:00:06,950 --> 01:00:09,860
And so I like, I worked
my butt off and I just, I,

972
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:14,980
that whole semester I was like hacking
my way through it and I get to the the

973
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:19,370
pawn so I have to pick, pick one of
his chairs and make it eight times.

974
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:25,480
He made this beautiful bench out of just
four pieces of wood and I'm thinking to

975
01:00:25,971 --> 01:00:29,570
myself, wow, these benches is really big.
That's a lot of wood. I can't afford this.

976
01:00:29,571 --> 01:00:33,180
I don't know. I'm just a freshman
in college and so I'm out.

977
01:00:33,250 --> 01:00:35,930
You had to cover all your material
costs. Oh yeah. Okay. No, no.

978
01:00:36,230 --> 01:00:38,540
That's an important detail.
Right? So study job. At the time,

979
01:00:38,541 --> 01:00:41,600
I was trying to like find
this harder. I could. And so

980
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:47,200
I'm in the quad one day outside
the freshman dorms and um,

981
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:48,710
I make an observation.

982
01:00:49,490 --> 01:00:53,680
Everyone's standing around smoking here
in the quad and there's actually newer

983
01:00:53,690 --> 01:00:55,110
to sit,
Huh,

984
01:00:56,090 --> 01:00:58,730
I've got this bench design
that I'm going to make.

985
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:02,210
What if I approached the school,
get them to pay for the wood,

986
01:01:02,211 --> 01:01:03,410
I'll make the benches from or project,

987
01:01:03,411 --> 01:01:05,780
then they can have them afterwards to
put in the quad for people to sit on.

988
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:09,740
So I go to the, the head of
resident's life. I pitched
him the idea, he gloves it,

989
01:01:09,830 --> 01:01:12,590
they fund a few thousand dollars
worth of this inch thick plywood.

990
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:16,460
And in doing so,
I get access to the schools,

991
01:01:16,461 --> 01:01:20,810
wood shops and this school's
craftsmen like who work on campus.

992
01:01:21,350 --> 01:01:25,340
And so now I've got their help to help
fabricate these, these benches. Amazing.

993
01:01:25,490 --> 01:01:28,190
And they paid for all the wood, which
I definitely could never have afforded.

994
01:01:28,550 --> 01:01:29,990
And so,
um,

995
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:35,440
by the end of the semester I've amassed
16 full size functional chairs and

996
01:01:36,321 --> 01:01:40,610
Gareth had no clue and actually finished
the last chair at about two in the

997
01:01:40,611 --> 01:01:44,630
morning, the night before the final
crit, the day before the final crit.

998
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:48,530
Chris, his critique, right? A critique.

999
01:01:48,531 --> 01:01:51,170
In art school you have these critiques
where you put your arm, your workout,

1000
01:01:51,171 --> 01:01:54,500
and then the professor and the class
critique you and that's how you learn how

1001
01:01:54,501 --> 01:01:55,820
to improve as an artist or designer.

1002
01:01:57,050 --> 01:02:01,190
And so it's like now December,
it's freezing cold outside.

1003
01:02:01,191 --> 01:02:06,191
It's providence and I specifically chose
the slot right after lunch to present

1004
01:02:08,270 --> 01:02:11,780
because I figured when everyone's out
getting lunch, I'll get my roommates,

1005
01:02:11,781 --> 01:02:16,140
a couple buddies to help me carry all
these chairs and assembled them in the

1006
01:02:16,141 --> 01:02:17,510
space.
When people come back,

1007
01:02:17,511 --> 01:02:20,830
there'll be this great reveal
moment because nobody has
any clue except a couple

1008
01:02:20,831 --> 01:02:24,960
of friends. Exactly what I've
pulled off here. It's him.

1009
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:31,340
My only regret from this project is that
I did not have a camera in my hand to

1010
01:02:31,350 --> 01:02:34,680
take a picture of Gareth's face
when he entered the studio.

1011
01:02:37,030 --> 01:02:37,540
I'm swear,

1012
01:02:37,540 --> 01:02:42,540
I'm standing there and he comes marching
in and he picks his head up and he

1013
01:02:43,441 --> 01:02:48,000
looks at the room suddenly and you can
see him counting and his head is 15, 16.

1014
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:53,250
And he looks at me and he
goes, Joe, you've done it.

1015
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:57,030
You've proved me wrong.
And I'm like,

1016
01:03:01,570 --> 01:03:04,540
the rest of the critique, we all send
my chairs and we talked about that,

1017
01:03:04,541 --> 01:03:08,670
the project. And um, I got
very hard marks obviously.

1018
01:03:09,450 --> 01:03:10,283
And um,

1019
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:14,220
it was one of those breakthrough moments
where you have somebody that you look

1020
01:03:14,221 --> 01:03:18,900
up to tell you can't do something and
you are literally tasked with something

1021
01:03:18,901 --> 01:03:22,110
you've never done before and
somehow you persevere through it.

1022
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:26,310
You asked for help, you,
um, you figure it out.

1023
01:03:26,311 --> 01:03:30,480
And on the other side of
that, I was sitting there in
this chair's thinking, wow,

1024
01:03:30,510 --> 01:03:34,710
like if I could figure this out,
what else could I figure out? Yeah.

1025
01:03:34,860 --> 01:03:39,860
Like this seemed like an impossible
feat before this whole thing started.

1026
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:42,150
And here I am,
I'm sitting in these chairs,

1027
01:03:42,870 --> 01:03:46,290
the professors like beaming at me like,

1028
01:03:46,690 --> 01:03:48,750
and it was just like one of these,
these moments.

1029
01:03:48,751 --> 01:03:53,130
It did one has in life where you
sort of crossed a threshold of,

1030
01:03:53,210 --> 01:03:57,720
of understanding your limits.
And at that point I had a new,

1031
01:03:57,780 --> 01:04:01,740
a new bar or a new set of limits.
How did you feel for,

1032
01:04:03,270 --> 01:04:07,590
from the point that he said that for
the rest of the day, what, what did,

1033
01:04:07,650 --> 01:04:11,520
what did the rest of the day look like?
I mean, well first of all I was so tired.

1034
01:04:11,521 --> 01:04:15,060
I'd been up for, um, actually I hadn't
slept for about three days before that.

1035
01:04:15,510 --> 01:04:19,220
So over 48 hours I was without sleep.
Um,

1036
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:24,260
so I was delirious a B
I was just so relieved.

1037
01:04:25,980 --> 01:04:27,120
And then third I was like,

1038
01:04:28,050 --> 01:04:31,680
there's the six excitement
inside of me was like, I just,

1039
01:04:31,710 --> 01:04:33,000
I just proved myself wrong.

1040
01:04:34,590 --> 01:04:36,780
Well what else can I
prove myself wrong on?

1041
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:42,200
And suddenly it's like there was so much
possibility of anything at this point

1042
01:04:42,301 --> 01:04:45,390
forward that I come across.
It feels impossible.

1043
01:04:45,690 --> 01:04:49,020
I probably need to take a second look
at that and rethink that based on this

1044
01:04:49,021 --> 01:04:50,670
experience.
Because again,

1045
01:04:50,671 --> 01:04:54,150
like how do you make a chair and then
how do you make 16 full sized functional

1046
01:04:54,151 --> 01:04:57,480
chairs at the end of the pro
over a course of a semester.

1047
01:04:58,350 --> 01:05:00,360
And so what's cool is that
the bench has gotten stalled.

1048
01:05:00,361 --> 01:05:03,450
Students are sitting in them for, they
lasted for a couple of years after that.

1049
01:05:04,050 --> 01:05:07,830
And so the legacy of it, not we'll
only went to the benches, but the,

1050
01:05:08,610 --> 01:05:13,610
the story of what had happened became
his story that he told every class after

1051
01:05:14,551 --> 01:05:18,160
that. So that's, that's really
powerful and a bunch of levels,

1052
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:22,300
right? I guess, uh, not only, and I have
to, I don't know the guy of course at all,

1053
01:05:22,301 --> 01:05:26,530
but I have to give the professor
credit for being willing to say, Hey,

1054
01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:30,070
like you proved me wrong.
Maybe as also just in that moment,

1055
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:35,200
the power of that reinforcement for
you as it is a big deal. I mean,

1056
01:05:35,201 --> 01:05:38,230
that's a really big deal.
Potentially.

1057
01:05:38,750 --> 01:05:43,210
Life-Defining influction point of sorts.
Secondly,

1058
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:47,770
the few things occurred to me. You
created eight. You also created a,

1059
01:05:48,370 --> 01:05:51,980
a product, an outcome that
people could use, right?

1060
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,310
Versus a scale model.

1061
01:05:54,910 --> 01:05:59,910
And you created a story that would
then set the bar infinitely higher,

1062
01:06:01,270 --> 01:06:03,700
not necessarily the past fail mark,
but the,

1063
01:06:03,701 --> 01:06:08,701
you can fucking do this mark four
students for generations to come.

1064
01:06:11,131 --> 01:06:13,420
Like many, many classes to
come. That's a big deal.

1065
01:06:13,660 --> 01:06:17,830
I've said big deal a lot cause I think
you're a big deal Joe. Ah, it's true.

1066
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:19,780
And uh,

1067
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:25,080
one question that occurred to me while
I was listening to this was related to

1068
01:06:26,591 --> 01:06:27,730
the moment when he said that

1069
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:32,470
you couldn't do it or you thought you
couldn't do it and how you responded to

1070
01:06:32,471 --> 01:06:37,450
that. It made me think of a story that I
heard from Alexis Ohanian Co founder of

1071
01:06:37,451 --> 01:06:39,670
Reddit when they went in early,

1072
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:43,870
some relatively early in the development
of Reddit to meet with Yahoo.

1073
01:06:44,410 --> 01:06:49,410
And they were showing traffic numbers
and analytics to this Yahoo Exec.

1074
01:06:50,860 --> 01:06:52,660
And the Yahoo exact made this comment,

1075
01:06:52,661 --> 01:06:56,380
which probably to him or her at the
time didn't seem like a big deal,

1076
01:06:56,860 --> 01:07:00,190
but they said,
oh well this is a rounding error for us.

1077
01:07:01,210 --> 01:07:03,460
And to my recollection,

1078
01:07:03,490 --> 01:07:06,310
Alexis and his team,

1079
01:07:06,311 --> 01:07:11,311
in fact the office and they put you
are a rounding error up on the wall to

1080
01:07:13,001 --> 01:07:13,870
motivate the team,

1081
01:07:14,740 --> 01:07:19,740
but not everybody responds to what you
could view as a deathblow that way.

1082
01:07:21,990 --> 01:07:25,270
So where'd you get that from? Is
that from sports, from your parents?

1083
01:07:25,271 --> 01:07:28,900
Is it from somewhere else?
Is it just your programming?

1084
01:07:30,730 --> 01:07:32,080
Where do you think that comes from?

1085
01:07:32,430 --> 01:07:35,940
Just one source. I think sports
is definitely a way to, to,

1086
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:39,630
if I had to point to something and played
so many sports growing up from tennis

1087
01:07:39,631 --> 01:07:43,720
to baseball to basketball, the track
and field and cross country. Um,

1088
01:07:43,890 --> 01:07:47,220
like some of those are team sports,
some of those are individual sports.

1089
01:07:47,270 --> 01:07:51,450
And in all of those,
I mean in any sport that's competitive,

1090
01:07:51,451 --> 01:07:55,590
you're trying to ultimately compete
with yourself to do a better performance

1091
01:07:55,591 --> 01:07:58,320
than you did the last time. Right. Um,

1092
01:07:58,350 --> 01:08:03,030
and so I looked at sports
as this constant. Um,

1093
01:08:03,690 --> 01:08:07,020
I was, I was in a game with myself and
like cross country was a great example.

1094
01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:08,011
That sport,

1095
01:08:08,011 --> 01:08:12,120
like for me was I feel like where I
honed my goal setting and was able to

1096
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:16,220
practice pushing my limits. So every, um,

1097
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:17,750
I would,

1098
01:08:17,750 --> 01:08:22,750
if I cross the finish line and I could
still really like walk and had energy to

1099
01:08:23,061 --> 01:08:26,140
me that was energy I could use on the
course through run a faster race. Huh.

1100
01:08:26,330 --> 01:08:30,920
And so eventually I got to this point
where I literally would collapse after the

1101
01:08:30,921 --> 01:08:35,510
finish line and it became so well known
that like the medics would be waiting

1102
01:08:35,511 --> 01:08:38,820
for me in that have the ice bags
and like they'd have like the,

1103
01:08:38,830 --> 01:08:42,410
the ivy just in case and like the parents
would be there to like pick me up.

1104
01:08:42,411 --> 01:08:45,980
And um, um, in the last, you know,

1105
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:47,630
800 meters to the finish line,

1106
01:08:48,110 --> 01:08:51,470
I'd always try to find somebody who was
running a little bit faster than me and

1107
01:08:51,471 --> 01:08:54,650
I th I just would try to
accelerate to catch up with them,

1108
01:08:54,651 --> 01:08:58,960
draft them a little bit.
And then sometimes I'd be
neck and neck with them too,

1109
01:08:58,970 --> 01:09:01,550
like in the finish lines
with insight so close.

1110
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:05,030
And I would just say out loud to
them, I'd say, you're not beating me.

1111
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:06,800
You're not beating me.
And I'd,

1112
01:09:06,830 --> 01:09:11,210
I'd use that to motivate myself just to
try to run faster to get a better time.

1113
01:09:12,770 --> 01:09:14,670
That's amazing there.

1114
01:09:16,580 --> 01:09:19,080
I'm glad you brought up
the sports because Paul,

1115
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:22,700
part of the reason I asked is that it in,

1116
01:09:22,740 --> 01:09:27,740
it's a slightly different lesson maybe
or one lesson that I took from sports.

1117
01:09:28,521 --> 01:09:30,560
I went to two different high schools.

1118
01:09:30,561 --> 01:09:32,750
The second high school I
went to had mandatory sports,

1119
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:35,330
which I felt was really in retrospect,

1120
01:09:35,331 --> 01:09:40,331
important for a lot of kids and by
being forced to do various sports,

1121
01:09:42,681 --> 01:09:46,790
primarily wrestling in my case,
if you want to get better,

1122
01:09:46,791 --> 01:09:51,020
you're going to train with people who
are better than you. Yes. By definition,

1123
01:09:51,021 --> 01:09:54,890
you are going to be
beaten by other people.

1124
01:09:55,580 --> 01:09:59,360
And at least to my experts,
I started to view

1125
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:05,630
any type of failure in that capacity
being beaten as feedback, right?

1126
01:10:05,631 --> 01:10:09,020
I mean you're, it's like a crit,
right? It's a, it's a, it's a,

1127
01:10:09,021 --> 01:10:11,500
it's a sports based crit. And, uh,

1128
01:10:11,930 --> 01:10:16,700
that's why oftentimes when a,
and if you have a good coach,

1129
01:10:16,730 --> 01:10:20,440
they're also going to be
pushing you beyond what your
perceived limits are. 100%.

1130
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:24,920
Right. So you get into the habit, perhaps
subconscious or otherwise of asking,

1131
01:10:24,921 --> 01:10:25,850
is this impossible?

1132
01:10:25,851 --> 01:10:29,420
Really impossible because I never
thought I would break whatever,

1133
01:10:29,450 --> 01:10:30,800
six minute mile and I just did that.

1134
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:35,060
And then I never thought I was gonna
break at five 30 mile and my coach just

1135
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:38,510
helped me to do that.
Or I figured out this hack,

1136
01:10:38,540 --> 01:10:41,360
which is chasing the fastest person
in front of me and then saying,

1137
01:10:41,361 --> 01:10:43,820
you're not going to be me, are not going
to beat me. And then I collapsed on him.

1138
01:10:44,060 --> 01:10:47,990
Big Mess of a heap at the end button on
the last, hey, I just be five 30. Exactly.

1139
01:10:47,991 --> 01:10:52,960
Or whatever it is. Uh, and you, you
feel like you've, you've expanded it,

1140
01:10:52,961 --> 01:10:53,690
like you've,

1141
01:10:53,690 --> 01:10:56,780
you've pushed the limits of
what you thought was possible
within myself and that,

1142
01:10:56,781 --> 01:10:58,620
that for me it was like one
of the greatest feelings yeah.

1143
01:10:58,890 --> 01:11:00,070
That I had at that time,

1144
01:11:00,260 --> 01:11:05,120
which strikes me is that for me I didn't
have many vehicles for expanding that

1145
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:09,890
capability. That was, that
was as tangible sports.

1146
01:11:10,310 --> 01:11:11,930
But design is super tangible,
right?

1147
01:11:11,931 --> 01:11:16,931
I mean you're building these chairs
and these benches and a should,

1148
01:11:17,220 --> 01:11:19,410
I should also just mention as
a side note that I want to,

1149
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:24,560
I want to come back to [inaudible]
that I don't think it's ever too late.

1150
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:27,840
People might be listening saying,
well hey,

1151
01:11:28,110 --> 01:11:32,820
I didn't have a great cross country
team or wrestling coach in high school.

1152
01:11:32,821 --> 01:11:35,200
So kind of up Shit's creek.

1153
01:11:35,201 --> 01:11:39,750
It's like no actually you can
still develop that, right.

1154
01:11:39,751 --> 01:11:41,250
With physical training and,

1155
01:11:41,251 --> 01:11:46,251
and other outlets to expand your
capabilities and your perception of what's

1156
01:11:46,381 --> 01:11:46,970
possible.

1157
01:11:46,970 --> 01:11:47,390
Sure.

1158
01:11:47,390 --> 01:11:51,140
And it's so funny cause that was a piece
of advice I got in seventh grade when I

1159
01:11:51,141 --> 01:11:55,150
started playing basketball. The
basketball coach said, Joe, Joe,

1160
01:11:55,151 --> 01:11:56,690
if you want to get better at basketball,

1161
01:11:56,691 --> 01:11:58,650
you need to play with people
who were better than you. Yeah.

1162
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:01,940
And so when I used to go to the,
to the wide shoot hoops in the weekend,

1163
01:12:02,450 --> 01:12:04,010
I wouldn't play with
people my age or younger.

1164
01:12:04,011 --> 01:12:07,490
It actually play with the high schoolers
who were much bigger, much stronger,

1165
01:12:07,491 --> 01:12:11,810
much more talented than I was. And of
course I got pushed around and I'm like,

1166
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:16,310
you know, you get bumped around
by guys who were, you know, um,

1167
01:12:16,610 --> 01:12:20,930
playing on the varsity team. But man,
my skills, the learning curve that year,

1168
01:12:21,380 --> 01:12:25,550
I feel like that was, that was like a,
another kind of threshold moment of like,

1169
01:12:25,850 --> 01:12:28,430
I'm not very good at basketball too,
actually. Okay. I've got some skills now.

1170
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:31,700
And so I think since that,
since that moment,

1171
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:37,400
I've always sought to try to find people
to play with who's better than me and

1172
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:39,560
that'll certainly come up back
up when we talk about airbnb.

1173
01:12:39,870 --> 01:12:44,730
So the, so the Welshman yes. And
seeds, defeat gas, so to speak.

1174
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:49,810
Um, I, I by the way, I, um,
I caught up for him with him,

1175
01:12:50,750 --> 01:12:55,750
caught up with him for a coffee about
12 years later and I had to ask them,

1176
01:12:56,561 --> 01:13:00,070
I'm like,
here's my experience of that conversation.

1177
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:04,660
Like what the hell were you thinking? Why
didn't you get behind me? And he goes,

1178
01:13:04,990 --> 01:13:09,430
Joe, come on. I knew that if I told
you you couldn't do it, he would.

1179
01:13:13,470 --> 01:13:14,440
Oh you,

1180
01:13:16,770 --> 01:13:17,670
we have a great relationship.

1181
01:13:17,671 --> 01:13:21,480
And I seen him when I get back
to campus and it's very cool. So,

1182
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:24,710
so phase shifts, you have that
experience, that experience

1183
01:13:24,740 --> 01:13:28,580
and is a great segway of sports
into my wrist experience.

1184
01:13:29,210 --> 01:13:33,340
I love basketball as we've
been talking about. And I,

1185
01:13:33,830 --> 01:13:37,670
I walked into the office of student
life one day and I go to the guy at the

1186
01:13:37,671 --> 01:13:40,010
front desk and say,
I want to play on the basketball team.

1187
01:13:40,540 --> 01:13:43,910
And he gives me this funny face and he
goes, we don't have a basketball team.

1188
01:13:45,410 --> 01:13:48,830
And all of a sudden there's
this like this awkward silence.

1189
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:53,390
It was just staring at each other
and he breaks his silence by saying,

1190
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:58,130
you can start one. If you want to and
you go, really what's involved in that?

1191
01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:01,790
And he goes, well, if you collect a list
of 12 other students that want to play,

1192
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:06,740
bring it back to me. I'm like,
that's it. And I'm like, okay.

1193
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:11,270
So I run off and they spent a week putting
a post up posters up around the dorms

1194
01:14:11,590 --> 01:14:14,380
and I gathered names of, you know,
11 other people play basketball.

1195
01:14:14,890 --> 01:14:18,310
It wasn't actually that hard. And
I come back to him like, okay cool.

1196
01:14:18,340 --> 01:14:20,830
Now when he goes, okay,
fill out this form,

1197
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:24,730
take this to the student
government meeting on Wednesday
to get recognized as a

1198
01:14:24,731 --> 01:14:27,370
student organization. I'm like,
okay. So I go to the meeting,

1199
01:14:27,371 --> 01:14:31,150
I present the concepts, might have a
basketball team, here's the paperwork,

1200
01:14:31,151 --> 01:14:34,270
here's the names, here's the like what
we think we might need for a budget.

1201
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:38,680
It gets pre approved from the student
government because then I'm like,

1202
01:14:38,681 --> 01:14:40,960
I go back to Mike, what's the
next step? He's like, okay,

1203
01:14:40,961 --> 01:14:44,890
well you need to find a gym. And, and so
one of these, one thing led to the other.

1204
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:46,473
And that year we,

1205
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:51,500
we started [inaudible] first basketball
team in 40 years and we started this,

1206
01:14:53,291 --> 01:14:53,861
this team,

1207
01:14:53,861 --> 01:14:58,810
it was like Hodgepodge Group of other
students and we would rent gym space at a

1208
01:14:58,811 --> 01:15:02,020
private high school in
Providence to go practicing.

1209
01:15:02,350 --> 01:15:04,560
And at this point we're just practicing.
Like we literally have,

1210
01:15:04,810 --> 01:15:06,610
there's no season and there's no games,

1211
01:15:06,611 --> 01:15:10,810
there's no other competition is
just us scrimmaging each other. And,

1212
01:15:11,430 --> 01:15:12,263
um,

1213
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:17,650
we made some really basic uniforms
and just got things off the ground.

1214
01:15:18,100 --> 01:15:22,390
The next year when I came back to campus,
um, was, was different. I'm like, okay,

1215
01:15:22,391 --> 01:15:25,390
this year we're going to make a season,
we're going to play the teams. Like,

1216
01:15:25,391 --> 01:15:30,190
let's turn this into something.
Um, and so I get on the phone,

1217
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:32,380
I start calling colleges in New England,

1218
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:36,700
I'm calling community
colleges and you know, junior,

1219
01:15:36,730 --> 01:15:39,640
junior varsity schools. And, um,

1220
01:15:39,820 --> 01:15:42,610
I get on the phone with some of these
coaches and I introduced myself, hey,

1221
01:15:42,611 --> 01:15:45,010
this is Joe Gabby calling
from the [inaudible] on the
school basketball team and

1222
01:15:45,011 --> 01:15:49,270
I'd like to, hello? Hello.

1223
01:15:50,530 --> 01:15:53,650
Pretty much everybody's hung up on that
in the first couple of phone calls.

1224
01:15:54,670 --> 01:15:58,840
But then there was one college that took
my call on the ever forget it because I

1225
01:15:58,841 --> 01:16:02,710
had to sneak out of my graphic
design class to take the call.

1226
01:16:02,950 --> 01:16:06,190
It was a car key University
of Massachusetts and I'm
on the phone with their

1227
01:16:06,191 --> 01:16:08,170
head coach. He's like, yeah, okay cool.

1228
01:16:08,171 --> 01:16:11,260
Well we're not going to send down our
varsity team but I'll send my JV team and

1229
01:16:11,261 --> 01:16:15,040
I'm like, perfect, we'll
take it. So on December 4th,

1230
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:20,020
2001 we had the first risky basketball
game Rizzy versus Clark University and at

1231
01:16:20,021 --> 01:16:22,390
this point like it's so informal for us,

1232
01:16:22,391 --> 01:16:24,970
we've got these basic meshed
jerseys that are like reversible,

1233
01:16:25,030 --> 01:16:26,770
basically a practice
uniform for anybody else.

1234
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:32,760
And I'm a player coach leading the team
at this point and we're in not even her

1235
01:16:32,981 --> 01:16:36,070
own gym cause we don't have one in
some private high school gym around the

1236
01:16:36,071 --> 01:16:36,904
corner.

1237
01:16:37,780 --> 01:16:42,780
And the Clark University bus pulls up
and they're players start to get off the

1238
01:16:43,031 --> 01:16:45,850
bus and I'm going,
oh my God,

1239
01:16:46,690 --> 01:16:50,960
their shortest guy is taller than
our tallest guy. And they get it.

1240
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:54,660
They had coach three assistant
coaches and a trainer comes off below.

1241
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:59,760
It's just like 12 scrappy art school
students on the court with like Basic Mesh

1242
01:17:00,011 --> 01:17:04,450
practice jerseys. And I think what's the,
what's the coach came down to the court,

1243
01:17:04,460 --> 01:17:07,000
you kind of recognize what he got
itself into and he's like, oh boy.

1244
01:17:08,650 --> 01:17:12,830
And we had a few, I think about
150 fans Rizzy students show up.

1245
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:16,070
That first game.
I say we got blown out.

1246
01:17:16,071 --> 01:17:20,000
It was [inaudible] 94 to 49 but in my
mind that was a huge win because we

1247
01:17:20,001 --> 01:17:24,320
establish something like we got a
team established and off the ground.

1248
01:17:24,350 --> 01:17:26,200
It's a real milestone at Rezidor.
Yeah.

1249
01:17:26,510 --> 01:17:31,510
And it was an incredible experience
next couple of years because it was like

1250
01:17:32,331 --> 01:17:35,240
running a startup, you know,
you had to put a team together,

1251
01:17:35,270 --> 01:17:38,300
you had to raise funding,
you had to create a brand in a market,

1252
01:17:38,301 --> 01:17:40,070
that brand yet to get
people into the games.

1253
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:44,870
And one of the things I was most
proud of is that at Risley, the work,

1254
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:49,610
the work loads are incredibly difficult.
And once you get into your majors, they,

1255
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:49,970
you know,

1256
01:17:49,970 --> 01:17:52,820
they say like sometimes you never see
anybody again because they're just so

1257
01:17:52,821 --> 01:17:56,900
focused on, on the workload. And, um,

1258
01:17:57,350 --> 01:17:58,580
other than graduation,

1259
01:17:58,610 --> 01:18:02,990
the basketball games became the only
other time really during the year where

1260
01:18:02,991 --> 01:18:05,750
you'd have the full cross section
of campus under the same roof.

1261
01:18:05,751 --> 01:18:10,170
At the same time, students,
faculty, administration, um, uh,

1262
01:18:10,220 --> 01:18:11,660
professors,
alumni,

1263
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:14,750
people from brown who were just curious
and want to come over and see what this

1264
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:16,460
crazy Rizzy basketball team is doing.

1265
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:20,540
And so it was this really cool moment
where you just bring people together.

1266
01:18:21,110 --> 01:18:24,410
And that was, I think really
the, the, the, the undertones,

1267
01:18:24,470 --> 01:18:26,570
the undercurrents of what
the teams really about. Sure.

1268
01:18:26,571 --> 01:18:30,350
It was about sport and competition and
staying in shape and the comradery of

1269
01:18:30,351 --> 01:18:33,110
being on the team. Second to that was
also about bringing people together.

1270
01:18:33,690 --> 01:18:38,090
Uh, thematically makes sense if we're
time traveling, looking forward. Yeah.

1271
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:40,390
So that was a great experience.
Um,

1272
01:18:40,590 --> 01:18:44,970
I think a lot of people ask what the
name of the team is and um, you know,

1273
01:18:44,971 --> 01:18:46,290
because we're an art school,

1274
01:18:48,180 --> 01:18:51,260
we didn't have to have traditional names,
you know,

1275
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:55,650
Rizzy and any art school is all about
self expression and I'm not holding back.

1276
01:18:55,651 --> 01:19:00,540
And so there was a legacy of names on
campus that all had a particular theme to

1277
01:19:00,541 --> 01:19:05,190
them. And so the hockey team on
campus, it's called the Nads.

1278
01:19:07,020 --> 01:19:10,270
So when you cheer it's go gonads.

1279
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:13,650
And so when we started
the basketball team,

1280
01:19:13,651 --> 01:19:15,330
we had to sort of fall
in line with the theme.

1281
01:19:15,331 --> 01:19:19,710
So the team's called the balls and both
the nads in the balls are supported by

1282
01:19:19,711 --> 01:19:24,500
the jock straps versus the
cheerleading team. And, um,

1283
01:19:24,510 --> 01:19:27,210
there's a whole theme. I probably,
maybe we won't go into it here,

1284
01:19:27,330 --> 01:19:31,350
but there's like a whole theme of,
of sports at Rizzi that adds to the,

1285
01:19:31,590 --> 01:19:36,120
I think the, the levity and the humor of
it. Are they all testicle related? Um,

1286
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:40,190
there was a, there was a, um,

1287
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:43,380
I think there was a rowing team at
one point called the, uh, the shafts.

1288
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:46,870
It might have been though the Lacrosse
team, I think it was called a shaft. So

1289
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:52,250
it's a side note, side note
mix. I'm all caffeinated.

1290
01:19:52,910 --> 01:19:57,410
Do you know where the, the word avocado
comes from? And I don't, I'll tell you,

1291
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:02,720
it comes from, I believe it's, I
want to say an older Mayan language,

1292
01:20:02,721 --> 01:20:07,170
but someone can correct me
on the Internet. I'm sure
they will. Comes from a word,

1293
01:20:07,420 --> 01:20:09,630
a Hakata t l at the end.

1294
01:20:09,631 --> 01:20:14,631
I'll cuddle and avocado grow on trees
hanging one lower than the other and

1295
01:20:16,860 --> 01:20:20,220
hairs. And uh, that means testicles.

1296
01:20:20,790 --> 01:20:23,460
So if you want to make a risky,

1297
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:27,210
current Rizvi students who might
want to start another team,

1298
01:20:27,930 --> 01:20:30,390
you could go with the Avocados,
but it requires a bit of explanation.

1299
01:20:30,450 --> 01:20:31,300
What would that support be?

1300
01:20:33,810 --> 01:20:36,390
The most boring juggling
team and intramural juggling.

1301
01:20:36,690 --> 01:20:40,710
Remedial Juggling team juggling two, the
first and only juggling team in college.

1302
01:20:41,130 --> 01:20:42,720
So I have to ask,

1303
01:20:42,780 --> 01:20:47,070
because I've been wanting to
debut this question for a while.

1304
01:20:48,210 --> 01:20:51,180
We talked about crit, we've talked
about balls, which I think is a,

1305
01:20:51,210 --> 01:20:53,550
it's a bit of a reach,
but we can segway to buns.

1306
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:58,260
When does CritBuns enter the picture here?
All right,

1307
01:21:01,170 --> 01:21:03,510
so it's freshman year at Risley.

1308
01:21:03,630 --> 01:21:08,630
I'm in a drawing class and the way it
works again is like he'd come in and it'd

1309
01:21:09,481 --> 01:21:13,560
be an eight hour class in the morning.
You'd pin your work up on the wall,

1310
01:21:13,590 --> 01:21:15,630
you're drawing assignment from
the week before, and he'd,

1311
01:21:15,631 --> 01:21:17,760
what do we spend all day critiquing it?

1312
01:21:17,820 --> 01:21:22,380
We're having to Kristen and people would
ask afterwards, how'd your crit go?

1313
01:21:22,470 --> 01:21:25,050
Oh Man, my crit was so hard and
my teacher was so rough on me.

1314
01:21:25,051 --> 01:21:26,940
Or like it didn't go well or it was great.

1315
01:21:27,660 --> 01:21:32,660
And about four hours in your picture
that the environment you're in,

1316
01:21:33,181 --> 01:21:35,790
an art studio, hardwood
floors, metal stools,

1317
01:21:35,791 --> 01:21:40,650
wooden benches for hours and have sitting
on these hard, uncomfortable surfaces,

1318
01:21:41,190 --> 01:21:45,930
your butt starts to feel it and
everyone's wiggling around trying to get

1319
01:21:45,931 --> 01:21:49,620
comfortable. So by the end of
the day, you're incredibly sore.

1320
01:21:49,950 --> 01:21:54,950
And I watch as my classmates exited the
art studio with this bun print on the

1321
01:21:55,531 --> 01:21:58,500
seat of their pants because
all the charcoal does paint
and ink that's on these

1322
01:21:58,740 --> 01:22:02,220
studio surfaces rubbed off onto her
pants. And sure enough, I look on mine,

1323
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:03,270
my pants were ruined too.

1324
01:22:03,810 --> 01:22:08,810
So walking back to my dorm room and
thinking there's gotta be a better way

1325
01:22:11,170 --> 01:22:13,360
if we're going to enter these
credits for the next four years,

1326
01:22:13,990 --> 01:22:17,560
what have you had a seat cushion that
you could sit on to make you comfortable

1327
01:22:17,561 --> 01:22:20,770
and to keep you clean.
And so I got back to my dorm room,

1328
01:22:20,780 --> 01:22:25,390
I pulled up my sketchbook and I drew
that same bun print shape on the seat of

1329
01:22:25,391 --> 01:22:29,890
our pants and gave it some
dimension and I called it crit buns.

1330
01:22:31,390 --> 01:22:33,910
And you know at this point I had
no idea how to make a product.

1331
01:22:33,911 --> 01:22:37,690
That's just your first year of design
school. So I tucked the sketch away.

1332
01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:42,430
Now fast forward to five years later,

1333
01:22:43,090 --> 01:22:46,930
I've now done a dual degree in
graphic design and industrial design.

1334
01:22:47,740 --> 01:22:50,110
And at this point I know
how to make a prototype.

1335
01:22:50,111 --> 01:22:54,160
I know how to translate something
from a sketch book into, you know,

1336
01:22:54,161 --> 01:22:55,390
a real working prototype.

1337
01:22:56,350 --> 01:23:00,400
And so I make buns out of hard foam.

1338
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:02,980
You can actually sculpted
out of the special foam.

1339
01:23:03,340 --> 01:23:07,660
And I have this full size hard, you
know, representation of the shape,

1340
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:08,711
which is like,
you know,

1341
01:23:08,711 --> 01:23:12,070
two buns that come together and
there's a handle suits for portability.

1342
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,170
I take that hard model,

1343
01:23:14,380 --> 01:23:19,380
I cast it in rubber and then I pour into
the cast a expanding polyurethane foam.

1344
01:23:20,230 --> 01:23:24,850
So when I took the lid off there was
looking back and meet the first soft

1345
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:26,080
crippen's seat cushion

1346
01:23:27,610 --> 01:23:30,850
and it was great because now I could walk
around into my classmates, I could say,

1347
01:23:30,851 --> 01:23:33,070
hey, where do you guys think,
how much did you pay for this?

1348
01:23:33,071 --> 01:23:34,360
What kind of colors would you want?

1349
01:23:34,690 --> 01:23:37,780
And people of course had a cracked a
smile and they saw it and they had a good

1350
01:23:37,781 --> 01:23:42,730
laugh. Um, but I really hit a wall
because I had a one off prototype,

1351
01:23:42,731 --> 01:23:45,040
but I didn't know how to
get it to the next stage.

1352
01:23:45,490 --> 01:23:48,820
And I certainly didn't have the money
or the funds to do that on my own.

1353
01:23:50,050 --> 01:23:54,940
It was around this time my senior year
where I notice a poster on campus that

1354
01:23:54,941 --> 01:23:58,810
says, competition for the design
diploma. Submit your ideas here.

1355
01:23:59,850 --> 01:24:04,850
And at Risley they give you your degree
and paper to degree and they also give

1356
01:24:05,021 --> 01:24:06,970
the graduating class at
different object every year.

1357
01:24:07,390 --> 01:24:10,570
So I submit CritBuns for
the competition and it wins.

1358
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:14,740
It gets selected to be given out to every
graduate from the [inaudible] classes.

1359
01:24:14,741 --> 01:24:18,730
He hasn't five which is like
freaking incredible. However,

1360
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:24,480
they tell me this on May 1st graduation
is on June 1st that's not all the time

1361
01:24:24,910 --> 01:24:28,060
between that I have to deliver two
thesis projects for graphic design and

1362
01:24:28,061 --> 01:24:28,894
industrial design.

1363
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:32,920
I definitely don't have time to take on
anything else is how many students are

1364
01:24:32,921 --> 01:24:37,180
in the graduating class.
It's about 600 600 so

1365
01:24:39,590 --> 01:24:43,300
I'm like, I'm so exuberant and
excited that like, oh my God,

1366
01:24:44,290 --> 01:24:46,120
they'll pay for the,

1367
01:24:46,310 --> 01:24:50,590
the the manufacturing of a couple hundred
cushions at the same time. I'm like,

1368
01:24:50,591 --> 01:24:54,490
how the hell am I gonna get this done?
Like there's absolutely no time.

1369
01:24:55,360 --> 01:25:00,100
And so I start, I get onto Google and I
researched. I searched foam manufacturers,

1370
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:01,000
Tim,

1371
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:05,710
I called every single search result for
the first 15 pages I was calling people

1372
01:25:05,711 --> 01:25:08,200
in India. I was comfortable in
England. I was called people in Texas.

1373
01:25:08,201 --> 01:25:12,530
I was calling people in California
and everybody said the same thing. Uh,

1374
01:25:12,550 --> 01:25:14,080
well son, um, you know,

1375
01:25:14,081 --> 01:25:16,690
it's going to take you about six weeks
just to make the metal mould and about

1376
01:25:16,691 --> 01:25:19,180
another four weeks for
production. Sorry, quick.

1377
01:25:19,990 --> 01:25:22,570
And I just went through everybody
who's getting no, no, no, no, no.

1378
01:25:23,140 --> 01:25:27,300
So then I went to my professors
in industrial design and
they also said this is

1379
01:25:27,301 --> 01:25:30,840
never going to happen in time.
Now I'm at this point,

1380
01:25:30,850 --> 01:25:34,450
the school is getting a little nervous
because the clock is ticking here.

1381
01:25:35,470 --> 01:25:38,080
And they call me and they say,

1382
01:25:39,670 --> 01:25:43,290
how's the project coming? And I'm like,
it's cool, don't worry. And they go, uh,

1383
01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:46,300
so it was going to happen. And
I'm like, probably. And they go,

1384
01:25:46,301 --> 01:25:50,250
well you have until Friday at five
o'clock to tell us if it's a go or none.

1385
01:25:50,380 --> 01:25:53,200
So I'm like, okay, and
what is this on a Monday,

1386
01:25:53,201 --> 01:25:57,430
on a Tuesday of this is like
Monday. Alright, so fast forward,

1387
01:25:57,460 --> 01:26:00,730
it's four o'clock on Friday afternoon.
I have no options.

1388
01:26:00,731 --> 01:26:02,290
Everybody's telling me no,
it's never going to happen.

1389
01:26:02,291 --> 01:26:05,240
It's impossible manufacturing and
take many, many weeks if not months.

1390
01:26:06,230 --> 01:26:08,630
And I'm like, I don't have that
many weeks. We've got three now.

1391
01:26:09,850 --> 01:26:12,260
And so I go outside the
industrial design building,

1392
01:26:12,410 --> 01:26:15,620
it's like a sunny afternoon and I'm
laying on the grass right on the,

1393
01:26:15,621 --> 01:26:19,340
on the river in Providence.
And I feel the breeze on my face,

1394
01:26:19,341 --> 01:26:20,660
the sound of the birds.

1395
01:26:20,900 --> 01:26:24,350
And I'm looking up at the sky
and I'm thinking to myself,

1396
01:26:24,590 --> 01:26:28,010
I have to figure this out. I can't,
I'm not going to give up on this.

1397
01:26:28,790 --> 01:26:30,200
What haven't I thought of yet?

1398
01:26:31,710 --> 01:26:32,220
Okay.

1399
01:26:32,220 --> 01:26:36,870
And I realized that the guy that runs
the metal shop in the industrial design

1400
01:26:36,871 --> 01:26:38,700
building, this Guy Steve, I
haven't talked to him yet.

1401
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:41,910
So I run back in the industrial
design building. I go, Steve,

1402
01:26:41,970 --> 01:26:44,670
here's what's going on.
And he goes,

1403
01:26:44,970 --> 01:26:49,680
I've got this friend Sam up in Cumberland,
Rhode Island. He's got a tool shop.

1404
01:26:49,860 --> 01:26:51,870
Why don't you give him a call?
Maybe he'll help you up.

1405
01:26:52,570 --> 01:26:56,280
So I get on the phone with this guy, Sam,
and I just pour it out to him. I'm like,

1406
01:26:56,281 --> 01:27:00,360
Sam, this is what I want to
do. I give them every ounce
of enthusiasm that I have.

1407
01:27:00,361 --> 01:27:04,590
And at the end he goes, oh, you really
want this, don't you know, like yes,

1408
01:27:04,591 --> 01:27:09,120
whatever you can do. And he goes,
all right, here's what I'll do.

1409
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:13,500
I'll move a couple of projects around.
If you send me the three d cad file today,

1410
01:27:14,100 --> 01:27:17,550
I can make the tool this weekend and send
it wherever you need me to send it on

1411
01:27:17,551 --> 01:27:21,060
Monday. And I'm like, Oh my God,
I'm going to call you right back.

1412
01:27:21,270 --> 01:27:25,350
Because I remembered there was a pool
float company that I spoke to the week

1413
01:27:25,350 --> 01:27:27,780
before in Connecticut who pool float.

1414
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:30,930
So it's like they make like water wings
or whatever you would lay in and you

1415
01:27:30,931 --> 01:27:33,930
pull the noodles and the things that
float in water made out of foam.

1416
01:27:34,530 --> 01:27:39,450
And the guy told me, he said, well, I
remembered something. He goes, you know,

1417
01:27:39,451 --> 01:27:41,970
we can't make the mold in time,
but he finds somebody else,

1418
01:27:41,971 --> 01:27:42,930
we can produce the cushion.

1419
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:46,260
And the other thing is it had to have
a silk screen on the top that said

1420
01:27:46,470 --> 01:27:47,610
[inaudible] 2005 on him.

1421
01:27:48,540 --> 01:27:53,540
And so I call back this Guy Christoph
at like 4:50 PM right on a Friday.

1422
01:27:55,681 --> 01:27:56,790
He should have been gone.
Like,

1423
01:27:56,820 --> 01:28:00,330
I don't know how I caught him still
in the office and I go, Chris, off,

1424
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:03,180
it's Joe at rusty.
Like I found somebody to make them old.

1425
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:06,480
He'll have it to you by Monday.
Can we make it work? And he goes,

1426
01:28:06,900 --> 01:28:10,530
you really want this,
don't you as whatever you can do.

1427
01:28:11,670 --> 01:28:14,070
And he goes, all right, here's
the address to send it to.

1428
01:28:14,130 --> 01:28:15,570
So I literally call the school back.

1429
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:18,480
We might as well been five
o'clock and I'm like, we got it.

1430
01:28:18,481 --> 01:28:23,100
Here's where to send the Po, the
purchase order that, ah, two weeks later,

1431
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:25,110
the day before graduation,

1432
01:28:25,350 --> 01:28:28,710
600 CritBuns showed up on campus
with a silkscreen on top that said,

1433
01:28:28,711 --> 01:28:29,970
Rizzy class in 2005

1434
01:28:35,670 --> 01:28:40,670
the day before it was impossible of how
do you make 600 CritBuns 300 read 300

1435
01:28:43,351 --> 01:28:46,740
blue with a silkscreen on top
in such a short amount of time.

1436
01:28:46,741 --> 01:28:51,240
And everybody's telling, you know, like
everybody just stared at me and was like,

1437
01:28:51,241 --> 01:28:56,080
this is never going to
happen. Um, I was exhausted.

1438
01:28:56,650 --> 01:28:58,270
It's gonna happen.
However,

1439
01:28:58,271 --> 01:29:01,180
it was so fun to see my classmates
running around with crit buns.

1440
01:29:01,230 --> 01:29:03,360
Everybody had a pair and like,
um,

1441
01:29:03,450 --> 01:29:06,360
it was really fulfilling and it was
worth all the effort and all the energy.

1442
01:29:06,750 --> 01:29:09,660
And I finished my two thesis successfully
on time and I got to graduate and

1443
01:29:09,661 --> 01:29:10,494
everything.

1444
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:16,760
And while a lot of my classmates went
off to great jobs at some NASA doing

1445
01:29:17,041 --> 01:29:18,900
industrial design and summit,
um,

1446
01:29:19,140 --> 01:29:22,920
some of the big design firms
like ido and others, um,

1447
01:29:23,970 --> 01:29:25,860
I made a decision. I said, you know,

1448
01:29:26,970 --> 01:29:31,020
Rizzy and just design school in general
does such an exceptional job of helping

1449
01:29:31,021 --> 01:29:35,040
you come up with a creative process to,
you know,

1450
01:29:35,130 --> 01:29:39,990
think of really original creative ideas
there. They usually hit a wall though,

1451
01:29:39,991 --> 01:29:43,530
which is that you stop it at the
prototype and then you move on to the next

1452
01:29:43,531 --> 01:29:45,030
project.
And for me,

1453
01:29:45,660 --> 01:29:50,640
it built up this incredible desire
to figure out how did, how did,

1454
01:29:50,670 --> 01:29:52,920
how do you get to the shelf of a store?
Like,

1455
01:29:52,921 --> 01:29:56,430
how does your idea to transition from
that one off prototype all the way to the

1456
01:29:56,431 --> 01:30:00,240
shelf of the store? And so
I thought, well, I want to,

1457
01:30:00,241 --> 01:30:03,540
I want to decode this black box.
I have to figure this out.

1458
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:08,910
So I made a decision that I was going to
use CritBuns to help figure out how you

1459
01:30:08,911 --> 01:30:12,550
get a product from an idea in your head
to a sketchbook, the shelf of the store.

1460
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:13,770
So the day after graduation,

1461
01:30:13,771 --> 01:30:16,590
I started my first company
to make and sell CritBuns.

1462
01:30:17,430 --> 01:30:21,630
And the beauty of it is that I didn't
get paid for the graduation project,

1463
01:30:21,631 --> 01:30:24,960
but they gave me the metal
mould afterward, which is
a few thousand dollars.

1464
01:30:24,961 --> 01:30:28,410
So with the biggest expense out
of the way, I was off off the run.

1465
01:30:29,220 --> 01:30:30,840
So what happened? What
happened? A crypt punks,

1466
01:30:30,841 --> 01:30:32,040
why aren't you making crimp wants today?

1467
01:30:32,041 --> 01:30:36,750
So that summer I started to develop
the brand. I filed the patent,

1468
01:30:37,230 --> 01:30:41,400
which is design, has a design
patent on it, filed the
trademark and everything. And

1469
01:30:43,380 --> 01:30:45,960
I went back to the school that
summer and I said, you know,

1470
01:30:46,020 --> 01:30:48,030
that was so fun for the graduating class.

1471
01:30:48,300 --> 01:30:51,720
What if we did this for the incoming
class is a welcome to receive gift.

1472
01:30:52,350 --> 01:30:55,380
And they loved the idea and
they placed their first order.

1473
01:30:55,890 --> 01:30:59,160
And so on top of that order, I,
I tacked on my own inventory.

1474
01:30:59,710 --> 01:31:02,490
So I did this production run of I
think a thousand cushions, right?

1475
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:05,790
And two things happen.
The first is that

1476
01:31:07,410 --> 01:31:10,740
there are now 400 students running around
campus with CritBuns actually using

1477
01:31:10,741 --> 01:31:13,770
them in the studios. I give the talk
to them, I could take photos of them,

1478
01:31:13,771 --> 01:31:17,520
I could actually start to build stories
and narratives around how they use the

1479
01:31:17,521 --> 01:31:21,510
product.
And second thing that happens is on there,

1480
01:31:21,511 --> 01:31:24,120
forget in my apartment in Providence,

1481
01:31:24,630 --> 01:31:28,960
in the basement of like this really old
kind of early 19 hundreds apartment.

1482
01:31:29,750 --> 01:31:30,150
Um,

1483
01:31:30,150 --> 01:31:35,150
I had about 10 boxes of hundreds of
CritBuns like filled up this entire room.

1484
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:38,910
And I'm sitting there staring
at it. I'm thinking, oh boy,

1485
01:31:39,540 --> 01:31:41,460
nobody's coming to my
basement to buy these things.

1486
01:31:42,360 --> 01:31:46,050
I have to go to Allen's of the world
and Africa, how do I sell these things?

1487
01:31:46,860 --> 01:31:50,010
So I put together a sale sheet, um, and,

1488
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:55,080
and I put on my best shirt in my best
shoes and like just the best kind of like

1489
01:31:55,290 --> 01:31:56,700
professional look that I could have.

1490
01:31:57,330 --> 01:32:02,140
And the first story I walked into was the
Brown University bookstore and I asked

1491
01:32:02,141 --> 01:32:06,430
for the store manager and we sit down
in this little conference room and I

1492
01:32:06,431 --> 01:32:08,240
started to go through
my spiel and I put the,

1493
01:32:08,260 --> 01:32:12,490
the sales sheet in front of her and a
sample of cushion and going through the

1494
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:14,140
whole thing and a Mike,
you know,

1495
01:32:14,170 --> 01:32:19,030
given all my enthusiasm and about 30 or
so seconds in, she looks at me, she goes,

1496
01:32:19,330 --> 01:32:22,810
no thanks and gets up and leaves the room.
And I'm just sitting there,

1497
01:32:22,811 --> 01:32:27,640
this tiny little fluorescent
lit conference room by
myself with my cushion and

1498
01:32:27,641 --> 01:32:29,650
my sales sheet and no sale,

1499
01:32:30,610 --> 01:32:34,370
like actually pretty horrible rejection.
Um,

1500
01:32:34,810 --> 01:32:39,310
so I walked back to my apartment, very
slow walk, kind of like a Charlie Brown,

1501
01:32:40,190 --> 01:32:42,540
you kind of walk and,

1502
01:32:44,730 --> 01:32:49,510
and Athena myself. That sucks. I'm like,

1503
01:32:49,540 --> 01:32:52,360
how the hell am I going to sell these
cushions if that's the reaction I'm going

1504
01:32:52,361 --> 01:32:53,194
to get?

1505
01:32:53,680 --> 01:32:58,680
And it was in that moment where I
remembered this sales equation that I had

1506
01:32:59,741 --> 01:33:04,210
heard at this entrepreneur weekend at
Brown university that I snuck into one

1507
01:33:04,211 --> 01:33:09,211
time and the guy's talking gave this
equation for whenever you introduce a new

1508
01:33:12,581 --> 01:33:13,414
idea to the world.

1509
01:33:13,420 --> 01:33:17,230
It was an equation for receiving
rejection and how to move pass rejection.

1510
01:33:18,130 --> 01:33:23,130
And the equation was sw
squared plus WC equals m.

1511
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:28,630
Oh wow. Hell of a memory here. I'll give
myself zero seconds. I already forgot it.

1512
01:33:28,631 --> 01:33:29,380
All right,

1513
01:33:29,380 --> 01:33:33,880
so most time sw square sw squared
must have seen SWC equals emo.

1514
01:33:34,060 --> 01:33:38,980
Alright,
so sw squared is some will love your idea.

1515
01:33:39,160 --> 01:33:44,160
Some waltz plus who cares equals move on.

1516
01:33:48,990 --> 01:33:52,990
He was the bucket. I like equation. So
I'm telling myself, okay, STB screw,

1517
01:33:52,991 --> 01:33:55,780
who cares? I just got to move on.
And so I did. I'm like, all right,

1518
01:33:55,781 --> 01:33:57,760
I'm just going to find another story.
Some people are going to love it,

1519
01:33:57,761 --> 01:34:00,310
some people aren't. It doesn't
matter. I just got to keep going.

1520
01:34:00,370 --> 01:34:02,710
I can't get hung up in one person saying,
no,

1521
01:34:03,370 --> 01:34:06,070
I need to go keep going until I find
it can find somebody that says yes.

1522
01:34:06,670 --> 01:34:09,790
So I went to the next door, they
said to him, went to third store.

1523
01:34:10,690 --> 01:34:13,510
They also said no.
I went to the fourth store,

1524
01:34:13,540 --> 01:34:18,100
which was this little tiny gift boutique
store on Thayer street in providence

1525
01:34:18,101 --> 01:34:22,390
sign affair. Yes. Had a Halloween, aren't
there? It's a hell of Halloween. It is.

1526
01:34:22,391 --> 01:34:26,350
That's crazy. Street of young for
Halloween. Um, so I go into the store,

1527
01:34:26,770 --> 01:34:28,680
I give them the pitch, the sales
sheet. Now at this point I'm,

1528
01:34:28,810 --> 01:34:33,010
I'm tweaking everything. I'm
iterating as I go. And the woman goes,

1529
01:34:33,490 --> 01:34:37,270
I'd love to bike. I love to
buy some cushions from you.
And I'm like, oh my God.

1530
01:34:37,300 --> 01:34:41,580
She goes, I'd love to buy
for, and I'm like, Themis,

1531
01:34:41,610 --> 01:34:44,530
I hell yeah, she could have bought
one and I would have been Abby.

1532
01:34:45,130 --> 01:34:47,290
So she starts to go to the thing,
well here's, you can ship them to,

1533
01:34:47,320 --> 01:34:48,820
and here's the address.
And I go, oh no, no, no.

1534
01:34:49,510 --> 01:34:52,750
I'll go pack them up and my house and
bring them back to you today. She's like,

1535
01:34:52,751 --> 01:34:57,530
really? I'm like, yeah. I ran home. I
packed up my cushion. I was so excited.

1536
01:34:58,160 --> 01:35:02,450
I gave them serum. I went back
later that night after they closed,

1537
01:35:03,170 --> 01:35:05,060
it's like it's dark on Thayer street.

1538
01:35:05,330 --> 01:35:10,070
I go to the front of the store and I
press my face against the cold glass and I

1539
01:35:10,071 --> 01:35:10,904
can kind of see my,

1540
01:35:11,100 --> 01:35:14,540
my breath in the glass and there's a
dim light on in the back of the boutique

1541
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:19,560
that they're closed and I'm scanning
the store am squinting and there it is.

1542
01:35:20,450 --> 01:35:25,040
I can see CritBuns on the
shelf of the store. I'm like,

1543
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:28,250
yes,
like I did it.

1544
01:35:28,970 --> 01:35:32,010
Like everything after that
point was downhill like I,

1545
01:35:32,011 --> 01:35:35,080
it was like I knew how to walk into a
store and you had to talk to him downhill,

1546
01:35:35,120 --> 01:35:38,690
downhill. Good sense, like you're
pushing the ball downhill. Right? Right.

1547
01:35:38,930 --> 01:35:41,180
Before I was like trying to climb
up hill against all these obstacles.

1548
01:35:41,480 --> 01:35:43,970
Now it was just like coasting downhill.
Now,

1549
01:35:43,971 --> 01:35:47,660
was that because you had the skills or
because you did proven to yourself that

1550
01:35:47,661 --> 01:35:49,010
you could do it? It to
myself, I could do it.

1551
01:35:49,130 --> 01:35:52,460
Is that like one proof point for cushions,

1552
01:35:52,640 --> 01:35:56,510
for cushions on the shelf of the store.
I'm like Hallelujah. Somehow it happened.

1553
01:35:57,050 --> 01:35:57,883
Um,

1554
01:35:57,890 --> 01:36:01,610
now I have like even more confidence to
walk into a store and meet with a buyer

1555
01:36:01,611 --> 01:36:04,790
and ask the question now
what's the process to get a
new product into your store?

1556
01:36:05,300 --> 01:36:07,070
And they could sit down with
them and talk about the products,

1557
01:36:07,100 --> 01:36:08,930
how original it was.
Um,

1558
01:36:09,860 --> 01:36:14,120
so I make trips to Boston and talked
to stores there. I go down to New York.

1559
01:36:14,150 --> 01:36:18,320
I talked to Pratt and he talked
to um, school, visual arts,

1560
01:36:18,321 --> 01:36:21,170
talked to Parsons. Um, um,

1561
01:36:21,200 --> 01:36:24,980
I talked to more stores and Providence
who was the furthest away you traveled to?

1562
01:36:24,981 --> 01:36:28,250
Soccer Ponds? When I go home
to Atlanta for the holidays,

1563
01:36:29,030 --> 01:36:31,190
it's all that stores in Atlanta.

1564
01:36:31,250 --> 01:36:33,590
I mean everywhere I went I was
always carrying a cushion with me.

1565
01:36:33,650 --> 01:36:37,370
I talked to anybody about it. Right?
It was like everybody I talked to,

1566
01:36:37,371 --> 01:36:42,110
I just practicing the sales pitch. And
just as to get comfortable with it. Um,

1567
01:36:43,250 --> 01:36:46,700
so at that product, in that
concept, just, you know,

1568
01:36:46,701 --> 01:36:48,320
it was never meant to be anything huge.

1569
01:36:48,321 --> 01:36:53,321
It was just meant to be Grad school in
essence to help teach me like the whole

1570
01:36:53,511 --> 01:36:56,990
stack of product development because I
was doing everything out of my apartment

1571
01:36:57,170 --> 01:37:01,880
from the distribution, the packaging,
the fulfillment, the website, the press,

1572
01:37:01,881 --> 01:37:06,140
like everything was run for my desktop
computer next to my bed in my bedroom.

1573
01:37:06,670 --> 01:37:11,150
Um, and so I got like in a very micro,
very small scale, I get the full,

1574
01:37:11,670 --> 01:37:15,760
you know, ecosystem of what it means
to run something. Obviously the,

1575
01:37:15,761 --> 01:37:19,120
a very small manageable
scale, which is perfect. Um,

1576
01:37:19,130 --> 01:37:21,350
and so one of the,

1577
01:37:22,730 --> 01:37:27,020
one of the defining moments was
I set a goal for myself. I said,

1578
01:37:27,770 --> 01:37:30,680
what's the store shelf that
would be the pinnacle for me.

1579
01:37:31,220 --> 01:37:32,780
Like what would I just
be the most proud of?

1580
01:37:33,620 --> 01:37:38,620
And one of the most heralded shelves
for any designer to get on is a shelf at

1581
01:37:39,771 --> 01:37:44,180
the design store, at the Museum of
Modern Art in New York City. Huge, huge.

1582
01:37:44,240 --> 01:37:46,700
I mean there's legends are there
like you can get IEM stuff,

1583
01:37:46,730 --> 01:37:50,600
you can get George Nelson stuff, you can
get like the greats of the greats, right.

1584
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:55,290
Along with modern things of course.
And so I set my goal. I'm like,

1585
01:37:55,320 --> 01:37:57,090
I'm going to figure out how to
get crit buns into the Moma store.

1586
01:37:57,630 --> 01:38:02,250
And after two years of just not giving up,

1587
01:38:02,280 --> 01:38:05,700
I finally got my first order for Moma.
I will never forget that phone call.

1588
01:38:06,340 --> 01:38:07,173
Okay.

1589
01:38:07,960 --> 01:38:12,960
Now you are clearly gifted
or you've developed and
cultivated gifts with art and

1590
01:38:16,751 --> 01:38:17,560
design.

1591
01:38:17,560 --> 01:38:21,970
You've also had a lot of practice
pitching right through good and bad,

1592
01:38:22,050 --> 01:38:24,790
experiencing rejection and acceptance.

1593
01:38:25,300 --> 01:38:29,410
So what,
what got you the acceptance

1594
01:38:30,250 --> 01:38:33,290
and what was the, what was the,
what was the, what was the pitch?

1595
01:38:33,291 --> 01:38:34,310
What was the process?

1596
01:38:34,340 --> 01:38:36,920
At a certain point I think they realized
I wasn't going to going to go away.

1597
01:38:37,550 --> 01:38:40,220
And you're like, all right, let's just,
just easier to let this guy, he knows.

1598
01:38:40,221 --> 01:38:44,510
I never, I never asked him,
but the product that I'm
stolen out of their store.

1599
01:38:44,870 --> 01:38:48,670
Did you sell? Did you sent people
there to buy them? I didn't have to,

1600
01:38:48,950 --> 01:38:50,030
but I remember going,

1601
01:38:50,090 --> 01:38:54,110
I definitely made a trip down to New
York after I shipped him the order and I

1602
01:38:54,111 --> 01:38:55,730
walked in and there it was
in the shelf for the moment.

1603
01:38:55,731 --> 01:38:58,310
I took a picture and I just thought like,
wow,

1604
01:38:58,450 --> 01:39:01,160
like this seemed if you,
if you,

1605
01:39:01,161 --> 01:39:04,070
if I had told myself three years earlier
that I would have made a product that

1606
01:39:04,071 --> 01:39:08,470
would be on the shelf of the Moma store,
I would have said you're crazy. Like,

1607
01:39:08,540 --> 01:39:09,470
that's impossible.

1608
01:39:10,490 --> 01:39:13,120
So what gave you the,

1609
01:39:13,750 --> 01:39:17,330
the Chutzpah to pursue it for two years?

1610
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,910
And was it the fact that you'd,

1611
01:39:23,360 --> 01:39:26,660
I think it was just so many impossibles
that you'd prove impossible yourself?

1612
01:39:26,661 --> 01:39:27,620
Was it something else?

1613
01:39:28,130 --> 01:39:29,450
It was just wanting to experience it.

1614
01:39:29,451 --> 01:39:33,080
That feeling like what I imagined
it might feel like if I were to ever

1615
01:39:33,110 --> 01:39:37,510
accomplish something that was so,
it's such a stretch goal for me. Um,

1616
01:39:38,240 --> 01:39:38,811
I don't know,

1617
01:39:38,811 --> 01:39:42,260
like I just the dough off the
relationship with the buyer at the time.

1618
01:39:42,890 --> 01:39:47,660
And I think that just evolved into
an order eventually in, um, you know,

1619
01:39:47,661 --> 01:39:51,200
at that point like, wow,
what was next, right.

1620
01:39:52,380 --> 01:39:56,940
Was that, now I'm going to prompt one
thing because it just popped into my head.

1621
01:39:57,570 --> 01:40:02,370
Was Moma before or after?
I want to say trade show in Japan.

1622
01:40:03,930 --> 01:40:07,140
It was before. It was
before. Yes. We can't,

1623
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:10,320
I only remember bits and pieces of this,

1624
01:40:11,010 --> 01:40:14,850
but can you describe? Yes. Japan.

1625
01:40:14,960 --> 01:40:18,530
So the product ended up taking me
around the world and this was still for

1626
01:40:18,531 --> 01:40:20,170
colleges? Well, no,

1627
01:40:20,180 --> 01:40:25,180
I mean this is for any kind of gift
fair or any kind of event where there's

1628
01:40:25,851 --> 01:40:27,080
other designers selling their things.

1629
01:40:27,140 --> 01:40:30,890
So I got connected with this
website called design boom.com,

1630
01:40:31,130 --> 01:40:32,480
one of the biggest design
blogs in the world.

1631
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:36,180
And they had this thing called
the gift, the Gift Mart. Um,

1632
01:40:36,620 --> 01:40:40,640
and they basically would invite designers
from around the world to come sell

1633
01:40:40,641 --> 01:40:45,641
their things at these big design week
events where it'd be really hard to afford

1634
01:40:46,161 --> 01:40:48,650
access to it as an
independent young designer.

1635
01:40:48,950 --> 01:40:50,750
They would kind of create
that opportunity for you,

1636
01:40:50,840 --> 01:40:53,410
pay for the booth where they actually
have the entire span of small fee to pay,

1637
01:40:53,411 --> 01:40:56,350
but nothing like the actual costs. And
so they subsidize it to make it possible.

1638
01:40:56,920 --> 01:40:59,500
And so I got involved in that and
it took me all over the place.

1639
01:40:59,500 --> 01:41:02,860
I traveled Sydney, Australia
where I sold the cushion. Um,

1640
01:41:03,220 --> 01:41:06,910
I traveled to New York and I traveled
to Tokyo for design week one year.

1641
01:41:07,660 --> 01:41:12,660
And this was fascinating because I got
to experience what it was like to sell

1642
01:41:15,131 --> 01:41:17,230
the cushion in person to
directly to consumers.

1643
01:41:17,350 --> 01:41:20,230
It's one thing to sell to a store manager
than it is to sell to actual customer.

1644
01:41:20,240 --> 01:41:21,073
Very different.

1645
01:41:21,610 --> 01:41:25,780
The other thing was [inaudible] has
these events where the alumni can come

1646
01:41:25,781 --> 01:41:29,500
together and sell their creations with
its ceramics or furniture products.

1647
01:41:30,220 --> 01:41:35,220
And so at this point I had figured out
after hundreds of interactions with

1648
01:41:36,671 --> 01:41:38,430
people face to face,
you know,

1649
01:41:38,440 --> 01:41:42,550
I designed my stand with the cushions
and a big sign said CritBuns, you know,

1650
01:41:43,210 --> 01:41:44,890
supporting creativity where others can't.

1651
01:41:47,050 --> 01:41:51,820
And um, I actually have seen
it so many times at this point.

1652
01:41:51,821 --> 01:41:55,840
I was able to break the sales
process down into five steps.

1653
01:41:56,320 --> 01:41:58,960
There were five stages to
the crip on sales process.

1654
01:41:59,710 --> 01:42:02,260
The first stage is what I call the,

1655
01:42:02,261 --> 01:42:06,670
what the hell is that stage where
people are walking by and they do this

1656
01:42:06,690 --> 01:42:10,900
doubletake and they look at it
and they're like, what is that?

1657
01:42:11,470 --> 01:42:14,440
But the shape and the color is
interesting enough to draw them in.

1658
01:42:15,090 --> 01:42:18,490
And so then they get to stage two,
which is called the touch and feel phase.

1659
01:42:19,060 --> 01:42:23,320
They grabbed the product off the stand,
they squeeze it, they realize it's soft.

1660
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:28,300
The first smile, because also
my dating process, by the
way, please continue. They,

1661
01:42:28,690 --> 01:42:33,640
they kind of get a smile on their face
and they flip it over and they interstage

1662
01:42:33,641 --> 01:42:37,840
three which is the story phase.
So on the back of the package,

1663
01:42:38,230 --> 01:42:41,500
I tell them the story, you
know, in a couple of wines,

1664
01:42:41,980 --> 01:42:45,860
you know how the product was concepted
how has created who made it and she sees

1665
01:42:45,861 --> 01:42:48,850
him reading the story,
ah,

1666
01:42:49,060 --> 01:42:52,600
and then they smile and they make the
connection of why the thing is the way it

1667
01:42:52,601 --> 01:42:55,120
is.
Then they're stage four.

1668
01:42:55,960 --> 01:42:59,170
Step number four is tried and true.
I've seen this everywhere.

1669
01:42:59,890 --> 01:43:01,830
They immediately started going like
this with a cushion. They're here,

1670
01:43:01,900 --> 01:43:03,880
they're looking around cause
they want to try it out.

1671
01:43:04,510 --> 01:43:06,160
Does it deliver what it
says it's going to do?

1672
01:43:06,161 --> 01:43:07,780
Does it make any hard
surface more comfortable.

1673
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:12,040
So I always have a demo chair
nearby for people to try it out.

1674
01:43:12,760 --> 01:43:15,940
And so people sit down on it
and as they're sitting on it,

1675
01:43:15,941 --> 01:43:19,090
I had a chair next to them
and I had s we never did them.

1676
01:43:19,510 --> 01:43:22,750
And I figured out the question to ask,
I asked somebody,

1677
01:43:23,320 --> 01:43:24,940
how do you see this
fitting into your life?

1678
01:43:26,470 --> 01:43:29,980
And what's amazing is that people told
me all kinds of different uses that I

1679
01:43:29,981 --> 01:43:33,370
never even imagined for the cushion
was actually 35 different uses for it.

1680
01:43:33,580 --> 01:43:36,910
People use it for camping trips,
people take it to baseball games.

1681
01:43:36,911 --> 01:43:38,870
Soccer moms love it for their kids.
Um,

1682
01:43:38,950 --> 01:43:41,740
pregnant women love it cause it takes
pressure off your tailbone and he sit down

1683
01:43:41,741 --> 01:43:44,620
cause it's got a dip in the middle people
with sky article of it because again,

1684
01:43:44,621 --> 01:43:46,210
the dip in the middle,
it takes pressure for tailbone.

1685
01:43:46,810 --> 01:43:50,140
I went so many uses for the thing just
by asking people that question and the

1686
01:43:50,141 --> 01:43:55,141
minute that people could connect it to
something that's important in their life,

1687
01:43:55,520 --> 01:43:58,910
there's a very high percentage that they
bought it in 1999 it like it wasn't,

1688
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:02,600
you know, huge commitment bank
breaker. So that was stage four,

1689
01:44:03,620 --> 01:44:05,480
stage five I never could have predicted.

1690
01:44:06,410 --> 01:44:10,810
And this was really the
magic of learning what,

1691
01:44:11,060 --> 01:44:13,940
it's not only about a product
but it's about a story as well.

1692
01:44:14,600 --> 01:44:17,840
I would literally watch people
buy my product. They'd stand up,

1693
01:44:19,040 --> 01:44:22,370
they turned the next person in line.
He'd say, what the Hell is that?

1694
01:44:22,520 --> 01:44:26,510
And the person who just bought it would
literally tell them verbatim the story

1695
01:44:26,570 --> 01:44:29,540
of on the back of the package,
he would sell the product for me.

1696
01:44:29,750 --> 01:44:32,900
I would just sit back and watch this
happen and I'm like, this is amazing.

1697
01:44:34,010 --> 01:44:36,020
And I realized the power
of story in that moment,

1698
01:44:36,620 --> 01:44:40,850
that design is more than just a product.
It's more than just you know,

1699
01:44:40,851 --> 01:44:45,650
digital experience. It's that
cushion is 50% foam in 50% story.

1700
01:44:47,270 --> 01:44:51,950
It was a really valuable lesson and so
I used like I learned from that every

1701
01:44:51,951 --> 01:44:55,460
time that I went to these different
events. So here we are in Japan,

1702
01:44:56,330 --> 01:45:00,380
we're in Tokyo and it's really exciting.
My first time to Japan,

1703
01:45:00,620 --> 01:45:05,620
unlike thrilled like my senses are just
like overwhelmed with everything about

1704
01:45:06,681 --> 01:45:07,514
Tokyo.

1705
01:45:08,390 --> 01:45:12,140
And I'm at this five day
design events for design week.

1706
01:45:12,260 --> 01:45:17,260
This is back in late 2008 2007 and
so I go out there with 40 cushions,

1707
01:45:20,090 --> 01:45:24,020
which are these two giant
boxes like these, they take
up a lot of volume, right?

1708
01:45:24,380 --> 01:45:25,213
And I'm like,

1709
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:28,910
I take those things on the plane and
then I take them through the Tokyo subway

1710
01:45:28,911 --> 01:45:33,020
system and like it's really
awkward because you can't carry,

1711
01:45:33,021 --> 01:45:35,630
you have to like drag them.
And it's like, I'm like this

1712
01:45:35,780 --> 01:45:38,420
know for those people who
haven't been to Tokyo,

1713
01:45:39,110 --> 01:45:42,500
every once in a while we all encounter
a subway car that has lots of space.

1714
01:45:42,770 --> 01:45:45,170
That is not the default.
Uh,

1715
01:45:45,200 --> 01:45:48,830
particularly if you're going
during any busy period,

1716
01:45:48,831 --> 01:45:52,730
there are in fact certain stations
where they have attendance.

1717
01:45:52,731 --> 01:45:57,500
Wearing white gloves will push people
into the cars so that the doors can close

1718
01:45:57,590 --> 01:46:00,720
and it's sardines in a can.
So I'm just imagining you dragging these

1719
01:46:01,060 --> 01:46:03,220
judge.
I've got my big backpackers backpack.

1720
01:46:03,670 --> 01:46:08,670
I've got these two giant cardboard boxes
of 20 CritBuns each that are like heavy

1721
01:46:09,341 --> 01:46:14,230
and awkward and trying to navigate
than the narrow subway system of Tokyo.

1722
01:46:15,100 --> 01:46:17,740
And I get to my setup at the,

1723
01:46:18,160 --> 01:46:22,240
at the design fair and I've got this
little tiny folding table to my left and

1724
01:46:22,241 --> 01:46:24,970
Ryan all around me or other
designers as part of design boom.

1725
01:46:26,020 --> 01:46:31,020
And I'm so excited as people
come walking up on day one,

1726
01:46:32,890 --> 01:46:37,090
I started talking to them to try to
tell them the story and nobody speaks

1727
01:46:37,091 --> 01:46:40,480
English.
And by the end of day one,

1728
01:46:40,481 --> 01:46:45,130
I sold a total of zero CritBuns
and we're thinking to myself,

1729
01:46:45,160 --> 01:46:47,980
oh my God, this is, this is not good.

1730
01:46:48,930 --> 01:46:51,030
I'm definitely not going
home with 40 cushions.

1731
01:46:51,900 --> 01:46:54,990
I need to change my strategy here
because this is not going to work.

1732
01:46:54,991 --> 01:46:58,380
The story's not translating the power
of the story that works so well,

1733
01:46:59,130 --> 01:47:00,780
has no impact here whatsoever.

1734
01:47:01,620 --> 01:47:06,620
So thankfully through the young designer
next to me is Japanese and we struck up

1735
01:47:07,591 --> 01:47:10,050
a friendship that's going to be
together for the next couple of days.

1736
01:47:10,890 --> 01:47:14,670
And I'm like, I, I'm have a problem
here. I need to translate these things.

1737
01:47:14,671 --> 01:47:15,504
She's like,
well,

1738
01:47:16,260 --> 01:47:18,450
I can help you translate if you
want to make any written materials.

1739
01:47:18,451 --> 01:47:20,760
So it designed this poster overnight,

1740
01:47:21,210 --> 01:47:26,130
this giant poster that is all in
Japanese with pictures of CritBuns.

1741
01:47:26,640 --> 01:47:30,600
Um, I had a picture of a stadium seat
with an Arrow pointing to it and you know,

1742
01:47:30,610 --> 01:47:35,550
stadium seat seating in Japanese and then,
um, and somebody kneeling in a garden,

1743
01:47:35,900 --> 01:47:39,000
um,
I had somebody meditating on it and um,

1744
01:47:39,170 --> 01:47:42,330
she was so kind that to translate for me.
I ran to Kinkos at night,

1745
01:47:42,540 --> 01:47:46,160
got it printed in downtown Tokyo.
Uh,

1746
01:47:46,290 --> 01:47:50,400
and the next day I had this beautiful
poster that did all the explanation and

1747
01:47:50,401 --> 01:47:53,550
had demo chair printed out in
Japanese on the demo chair.

1748
01:47:54,270 --> 01:47:58,980
And one by one somebody actually
made a sale and I was like,

1749
01:47:58,981 --> 01:48:00,390
oh my God, okay, this is going to work.

1750
01:48:01,020 --> 01:48:04,020
And then I had another guy who actually
happened to be a [inaudible] Grad who

1751
01:48:04,021 --> 01:48:07,500
was there just visiting.
He spoke Japanese and he's like,

1752
01:48:07,501 --> 01:48:11,490
if you will help translate, I'm happy to
do this for you. So, uh, bless his heart.

1753
01:48:11,491 --> 01:48:12,151
He was amazing.

1754
01:48:12,151 --> 01:48:16,680
He actually would like draw people
over to my little folding table with my

1755
01:48:16,681 --> 01:48:18,060
stacks of CritBuns everywhere.

1756
01:48:18,390 --> 01:48:23,070
And he would tell the story in Japanese
and I'll never forget the last day.

1757
01:48:23,370 --> 01:48:24,660
It was like towards the end of the day,

1758
01:48:25,260 --> 01:48:30,060
I mean he's Sorta kind of closing down
and we sold the last pair of buns and

1759
01:48:30,061 --> 01:48:33,330
there's this picture of him and I sitting
there at this empty table being like,

1760
01:48:33,360 --> 01:48:34,740
oh my God,
I can't believe he did it.

1761
01:48:35,580 --> 01:48:39,240
So I was able to pay for my trip basically
when the sale, these crit ones. Um,

1762
01:48:39,550 --> 01:48:43,320
and it was just a great lesson in like
having to figure out how to translate

1763
01:48:43,321 --> 01:48:48,060
your story beyond just, you know,
English speakers in my case. Um,

1764
01:48:49,130 --> 01:48:54,000
that, that was a role into
an experience. So man, that,

1765
01:48:54,040 --> 01:48:55,440
that project took me all over the place.

1766
01:48:55,830 --> 01:49:00,020
I got to meet the guy who
invented the foam finger. Sure.

1767
01:49:00,390 --> 01:49:04,200
Gerald Foss, who's here in Texas, um, uh,

1768
01:49:04,290 --> 01:49:07,460
to see if he wanted to do
manufacturing at one point. Um,

1769
01:49:07,710 --> 01:49:10,740
he'd go into his lobby and he's got like
the original foam finger from the 1970s

1770
01:49:10,741 --> 01:49:14,370
in the glass case. Right.
Totally random. Um,

1771
01:49:14,730 --> 01:49:18,740
I got to meet the late Billy
Mays. Oh, infomercials.

1772
01:49:18,780 --> 01:49:23,520
Oxyclean so I applied at one, many, many
more. Hey, I'm Billy Mays. We'll cover,

1773
01:49:23,530 --> 01:49:27,730
we're going to show you this
right now. And um, there was, uh,

1774
01:49:28,130 --> 01:49:32,100
the reality show at 1.4 inventors
and people that made products,

1775
01:49:33,420 --> 01:49:37,530
for some reason I was inspired
to submit CritBuns. Um,

1776
01:49:37,560 --> 01:49:42,560
and so I flew to la when one weekend and
I'm in this like lobby for the casting

1777
01:49:42,630 --> 01:49:47,630
with all these other inventors
and everybody like really
stuff like we'll have

1778
01:49:48,041 --> 01:49:51,720
stuff for cats. I feel like pet cats
like running around and, and like,

1779
01:49:51,850 --> 01:49:54,850
it's like a lot of pet stuff and
there's me like in one of my best shirts

1780
01:49:54,851 --> 01:49:56,470
holding my coupons,
like really proud.

1781
01:49:57,040 --> 01:50:00,670
And the priest comes over and they
mic me up and they're like, okay,

1782
01:50:00,700 --> 01:50:03,250
we want you to walk down that hallway
and go through those double doors.

1783
01:50:03,430 --> 01:50:07,900
And that's all they said. And so I'm
like, okay. So like on my products,

1784
01:50:08,200 --> 01:50:11,410
proud entrepreneur here,
I walked down the hallways to stick dark,

1785
01:50:11,440 --> 01:50:13,480
the lights were off this dark hallway,
all he can see,

1786
01:50:13,481 --> 01:50:15,070
he's like these two
eliminated doors at the end.

1787
01:50:15,550 --> 01:50:17,650
And I opened the doors and they're,

1788
01:50:17,680 --> 01:50:21,520
this huge conference table is
Billy Mays and one other Costar.

1789
01:50:21,940 --> 01:50:25,240
And then there's like all these cameras
and all these lights pointed at you.

1790
01:50:25,620 --> 01:50:27,460
He goes, Hey, I'm Billy. Nice. Come on in.

1791
01:50:27,910 --> 01:50:32,200
And I sit down in the chair and
suddenly among this like pitch session,

1792
01:50:32,230 --> 01:50:34,530
it was like shark tank before
shark tank. Right? Right.

1793
01:50:34,531 --> 01:50:39,210
Like I'm having to pitch him on
why my product so great. And um,

1794
01:50:39,370 --> 01:50:40,660
it wasn't going so well

1795
01:50:42,460 --> 01:50:46,570
until he tried it out and he like how she
got up and he sat down and 40, he goes,

1796
01:50:46,600 --> 01:50:51,520
oh yeah, that's what, this is a
pretty good. And, and then they said,

1797
01:50:51,521 --> 01:50:54,030
okay, thanks. And like
I walked out, it's like,

1798
01:50:54,400 --> 01:50:58,870
it's like blitz of like five minutes
of just pitch mode and what was like

1799
01:50:58,871 --> 01:51:01,000
getting peppered with all these questions
and all these lights on you and this

1800
01:51:01,001 --> 01:51:03,340
camera's,
I did not get on the show,

1801
01:51:04,300 --> 01:51:07,820
but it was just one of these crazy moments
of like these unexpected things that

1802
01:51:08,430 --> 01:51:12,270
this product, these experiences that
this project brought me see soon.

1803
01:51:12,310 --> 01:51:14,230
Why are you not,

1804
01:51:14,290 --> 01:51:19,270
why are you not the the Titan of the
CritBuns empire? Why did you stop?

1805
01:51:19,570 --> 01:51:22,930
So coupons,
this goes back to [inaudible].

1806
01:51:24,850 --> 01:51:29,650
I switched from being in painting to
being in industrial design largely in part

1807
01:51:29,651 --> 01:51:31,990
because I learned about
Charles and ray Eames,

1808
01:51:32,620 --> 01:51:37,570
two designers from the mid 20th century
that were a couple raves. The wife,

1809
01:51:37,600 --> 01:51:41,890
Charles is the husband and they
produce design that it's legendary.

1810
01:51:42,460 --> 01:51:43,900
It's still referenced today.
It's in the,

1811
01:51:44,230 --> 01:51:46,390
it's in the Moma and the
permanent collection.

1812
01:51:46,870 --> 01:51:51,220
It's iconic and they dedicated their lives
to producing the best designed to the

1813
01:51:51,221 --> 01:51:52,510
most people for the least price.

1814
01:51:53,380 --> 01:51:58,030
And they were really celebrated for
democratizing good design and making it

1815
01:51:58,031 --> 01:51:58,864
accessible.

1816
01:52:00,010 --> 01:52:02,860
I'd also add that the chair project
with Garth Jones and fell in love with

1817
01:52:02,861 --> 01:52:07,861
making things and realize that I
wanted to switch from this more um,

1818
01:52:10,450 --> 01:52:15,430
uh, creative pursuit of
painting, which was more about,
you know, the expression of,

1819
01:52:15,460 --> 01:52:20,350
of ideas through that medium into the
expression of ideas through industrial

1820
01:52:20,351 --> 01:52:23,890
design, which was cool to me because you
can make something objects and it can be

1821
01:52:23,891 --> 01:52:27,610
replicated thousands, hundreds,
thousands, millions of times.

1822
01:52:27,820 --> 01:52:31,180
You could actually touch millions of
people with your designs just like the

1823
01:52:31,181 --> 01:52:35,500
Eames had. And so this was my motivation
to switch into industrial design.

1824
01:52:35,530 --> 01:52:39,340
You could use design to improve people's
lives and it can be done at scale.

1825
01:52:40,660 --> 01:52:42,400
You could touch a lot
of people all at once.

1826
01:52:44,650 --> 01:52:48,350
And so [inaudible] and the industrial
design department did something brilliant.

1827
01:52:48,890 --> 01:52:50,510
Our first year in the program,

1828
01:52:50,780 --> 01:52:55,780
they put us all in in the the school
vans and they drove us out to the Rhode

1829
01:52:57,020 --> 01:52:59,930
Island state landfill.
And here we are

1830
01:53:01,460 --> 01:53:04,280
driving through these canyons of trash.

1831
01:53:04,460 --> 01:53:08,510
Like you have your faces pressed up
against the bus window and you can't even

1832
01:53:08,511 --> 01:53:12,770
see it at the top, well of the
landfill for, for the state.

1833
01:53:13,490 --> 01:53:15,200
And you get out to the top and you're,

1834
01:53:15,201 --> 01:53:19,820
you get out of the vans and you're looking
back over this just in a landscape of

1835
01:53:19,821 --> 01:53:24,410
garbage. And for me it hit me like
a ton of bricks. I'm like, wow.

1836
01:53:24,440 --> 01:53:29,440
Like I do not want to spend my life making
things that contributes to making the

1837
01:53:30,381 --> 01:53:34,190
landfill better, bigger. That
is not interesting to me.

1838
01:53:34,370 --> 01:53:38,390
It was like a really
impactful moment where I just,

1839
01:53:38,420 --> 01:53:43,120
I started to feel a slight sense
of guilt that I was now studying.

1840
01:53:43,170 --> 01:53:43,560
Um,

1841
01:53:43,560 --> 01:53:48,560
a discipline that is about making more
stuff and so it really kicked off this

1842
01:53:50,240 --> 01:53:54,530
enthusiasm or consciousness around how
do you make stuff that's environmentally

1843
01:53:54,531 --> 01:53:58,940
considered cradle the cradle cradle to
cradle. Yeah. I build Mcdonald's book,

1844
01:53:59,120 --> 01:54:02,630
which was also came in around
this time was hugely influential.

1845
01:54:02,840 --> 01:54:04,940
National capitalism kind of
came around in this time. These,

1846
01:54:05,300 --> 01:54:06,320
they're starting to be this,

1847
01:54:06,590 --> 01:54:09,830
this other way of thinking about
how we consume things in the planet.

1848
01:54:10,460 --> 01:54:11,670
And certainly I've,

1849
01:54:11,690 --> 01:54:16,070
you feel a responsibility as a designer
because you're pretty close to the

1850
01:54:16,071 --> 01:54:18,830
origins of those things. Sometimes
you don't decide the strategy of hey,

1851
01:54:18,831 --> 01:54:19,581
we need to make this product,

1852
01:54:19,581 --> 01:54:23,120
but you're definitely in it in the field
of view of being able to decide what

1853
01:54:23,121 --> 01:54:27,350
kind of materials to use, what's the
whole life cycle of a product. And so,

1854
01:54:28,690 --> 01:54:29,480
um,

1855
01:54:29,480 --> 01:54:34,480
with CritBuns I actually
delayed the launch of that
for six months because I was

1856
01:54:34,821 --> 01:54:39,530
trying to find a phone that was
environmentally considered and I called

1857
01:54:39,531 --> 01:54:40,100
everybody.

1858
01:54:40,100 --> 01:54:45,100
I sh I was talking to people in the
Midwest making foam out of soy beans.

1859
01:54:46,370 --> 01:54:50,540
At one point I found a woman in England
who started making plastic at a bubble

1860
01:54:50,541 --> 01:54:53,730
gum that you scrape off of the sidewalk.
Um,

1861
01:54:53,960 --> 01:54:56,840
but I couldn't find anybody that made a
phone that was perfect for the product.

1862
01:54:56,841 --> 01:55:01,841
So I decided to go forward the products
and that sparked this other idea,

1863
01:55:02,841 --> 01:55:06,830
which was, okay. Um, I've
learned two things from this. A,

1864
01:55:06,831 --> 01:55:09,230
the foam doesn't exist and be,

1865
01:55:09,590 --> 01:55:12,530
there's wasn't even a good source to
try to find the film in the first place.

1866
01:55:13,430 --> 01:55:13,671
Right?

1867
01:55:13,671 --> 01:55:17,000
Like Amazon was starting to really
emerge at this time and it was so easy to

1868
01:55:17,001 --> 01:55:20,030
find a book on Amazon or like content.
I was like,

1869
01:55:20,060 --> 01:55:22,940
why isn't there a site where you
can find sustainable materials?

1870
01:55:23,030 --> 01:55:28,030
I talked to some of my classmates that
we had graduated this point and um,

1871
01:55:28,370 --> 01:55:31,610
became very clear that whether you're
an architecture or fashion design or

1872
01:55:31,611 --> 01:55:32,960
package design or industrial design,

1873
01:55:33,650 --> 01:55:37,130
there was a growing consciousness around
we want to feel good about the things

1874
01:55:37,131 --> 01:55:41,450
that we're making. And so I realized
I'm not a material scientist.

1875
01:55:41,510 --> 01:55:44,640
Maybe I'm not going to invent the foam.
However, I know how to make a website.

1876
01:55:45,300 --> 01:55:49,740
So what if I started a site that would
allow any designer to connect with the

1877
01:55:49,741 --> 01:55:52,950
sources of Siena materials with
his bioplastics or you know,

1878
01:55:53,030 --> 01:55:56,700
reclaimed class or you know,
organic cotton.

1879
01:55:57,600 --> 01:56:00,150
And so a classmate and
I partnered up together,

1880
01:56:00,290 --> 01:56:05,290
but he named Matt and we created this
website to help solve our own problem of

1881
01:56:07,051 --> 01:56:11,550
having access to sustainable materials.
And um,

1882
01:56:12,300 --> 01:56:13,930
you know,
the site started in,

1883
01:56:13,980 --> 01:56:16,950
it was this combination of ecology
and in intellect. So we called it,

1884
01:56:16,980 --> 01:56:21,980
he collect and it was basically Google
for sustainable materials and we'd find

1885
01:56:22,471 --> 01:56:24,990
manufacturers around the world
and we plug them into the system.

1886
01:56:25,050 --> 01:56:28,770
And I was basically like a really high
in search engine and community for people

1887
01:56:28,771 --> 01:56:29,760
who cared about this topic.

1888
01:56:31,110 --> 01:56:35,400
So slowed down crit buns to
work on this website. You know,

1889
01:56:35,430 --> 01:56:37,260
the thing is that the,
the product remained.

1890
01:56:37,680 --> 01:56:40,860
I had figured out manufacturing abroad.
Um,

1891
01:56:41,160 --> 01:56:42,870
the [inaudible] website was up,

1892
01:56:43,020 --> 01:56:46,650
is getting press at this point from around
the world is getting blogged about I

1893
01:56:46,651 --> 01:56:50,700
shipping orders out of my garage this at
this point and moved to San Francisco.

1894
01:56:50,760 --> 01:56:55,630
My garage became CritBuns headquarters
and it got into some of the big catalogs

1895
01:56:55,650 --> 01:56:59,310
in the u s when it was called solutions
catalog. Just went out to like,

1896
01:56:59,370 --> 01:57:01,530
I don't know,
hundreds of thousands of homes.

1897
01:57:02,220 --> 01:57:05,130
And I had these orders
flowing in like my garage.

1898
01:57:05,131 --> 01:57:07,920
I had to employ some friends to come
help pack up CritBuns these orders of

1899
01:57:07,921 --> 01:57:11,330
hundreds at a time. It was insane. Um,

1900
01:57:11,370 --> 01:57:15,170
great learning experience and um,
you know,

1901
01:57:15,180 --> 01:57:17,460
in fact him something

1902
01:57:17,620 --> 01:57:21,630
Brock for you today. You kidding? Have

1903
01:57:23,360 --> 01:57:28,270
the original pair. Oh my God.
[inaudible] for you, my friend. Amazing.

1904
01:57:29,620 --> 01:57:34,330
This is incredible. Thank you so much.
Oh my God. Look at this very welcome.

1905
01:57:34,540 --> 01:57:39,540
Critbuns a seat cushion for artists
and designers for the love of the crit.

1906
01:57:40,140 --> 01:57:42,550
And then on the back we've got

1907
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:48,970
buns TM. These buns approved
for use on hard surfaces. Buns,

1908
01:57:48,971 --> 01:57:52,090
not a life saving air flotation
device. Good, good note.

1909
01:57:52,630 --> 01:57:54,910
They're intended solely
for cheek to cheek comfort.

1910
01:57:57,580 --> 01:58:01,810
Amazing. Thank you. You get
the story on the back of the
label. Oh yeah. Here we go.

1911
01:58:03,070 --> 01:58:07,480
The crip on story hours of critiquing
from the cold hard dirty floor and give a

1912
01:58:07,481 --> 01:58:10,240
young design student more than a sore bum

1913
01:58:12,130 --> 01:58:15,250
provided the inspiration for a
better way. Colon, a seat cushion,

1914
01:58:15,251 --> 01:58:18,850
offering day long comfort and cleaner
pants to art students worldwide.

1915
01:58:19,270 --> 01:58:22,600
The name and shape they
originated from the charcoal bun.

1916
01:58:22,601 --> 01:58:25,840
Print students left behind a
metal stools and hardwood floors.

1917
01:58:26,990 --> 01:58:31,990
Dubdubdub critbuns.com the term crit
slang for critique is the presentation of

1918
01:58:32,891 --> 01:58:37,210
students' artwork before professors and
peers and is a staple of every art and

1919
01:58:37,211 --> 01:58:41,740
design school experience.
Wait a minute,

1920
01:58:42,280 --> 01:58:43,061
my favorite part.

1921
01:58:43,061 --> 01:58:48,061

O D I don't know what that is.
And then you have a bunch shaped

barcode on the back for scanning.
This is great man.

1926
01:59:09,910 --> 01:59:14,890
I can see how the chairs already pretty
soft, but it is already pretty soft.

1927

I think I'll, I will save this for my

Thank you.

You're very welcome.

1930
01:59:22,390 --> 01:59:26,500
So Crippen's sorta is slowing down but um,
it's funny.

1931
01:59:26,501 --> 01:59:31,060
Every so often I still get an order. I
still get down to the garage still still.

1932
01:59:32,050 --> 01:59:35,320
I still pack it up and
ship it out and you know,

1933
01:59:36,940 --> 01:59:39,840
life's changed quite a bit since then,
but it's,

1934
01:59:39,860 --> 01:59:44,770
it's a great reminder for me of like
those early days and I have just hustling.

1935
01:59:44,771 --> 01:59:49,771
I was trying to get stuff done of like
the enthusiasm and the exuberance of,

1936
01:59:51,131 --> 01:59:53,800
of bringing an idea to life.
Like it was a rush.

1937
01:59:53,880 --> 01:59:57,270
And then you go from physical to digital.

1938
01:59:57,330 --> 02:00:01,170
What did you learn from the he collect

1939
02:00:01,590 --> 02:00:04,200
experience? Well, equal
like launched at a time,

1940
02:00:04,410 --> 02:00:06,150
and this might be hard to understand now,

1941
02:00:06,151 --> 02:00:11,151
but if you go back 10 plus years around
2007 web 2.0 it's happening on the

1942
02:00:11,581 --> 02:00:16,581
Internet and revenue is not cool.

1943
02:00:17,460 --> 02:00:20,400
Right? It's crazy thing. The new economy.

1944
02:00:21,160 --> 02:00:23,760
Webster point in our revenue was a cool
eyeballs, bought some cool traffic,

1945
02:00:23,761 --> 02:00:25,740
was great,
but the revenue didn't matter.

1946
02:00:25,741 --> 02:00:30,150
And so unfortunately we subscribed to
that as well with equal act and our

1947
02:00:30,151 --> 02:00:34,350
service is free and um,
we didn't make any money on it.

1948
02:00:34,351 --> 02:00:37,920
We bootstrapped the whole thing
and never took investment on it.

1949
02:00:38,700 --> 02:00:43,140
And the one thing that we did innovate
on that actually did make money for us is

1950
02:00:44,130 --> 02:00:45,300
we call it the green box.

1951
02:00:45,620 --> 02:00:48,870
The green box was basically like a
physical magazine that we shipped out on a

1952
02:00:48,871 --> 02:00:52,860
quarterly basis that allowed people to
build an actual materials library for

1953
02:00:52,861 --> 02:00:53,694
themselves.

1954
02:00:53,700 --> 02:00:57,570
So we sip ship actual samples with these
beautifully designed placards that gave

1955
02:00:57,571 --> 02:00:59,850
you all the information about it
with a special integrative hook.

1956
02:01:00,210 --> 02:01:02,850
So you can imagine a whole wall of
materials that you'd have in your design

1957
02:01:02,851 --> 02:01:06,660
studio or your design team in
house or consultancy, whatever.

1958
02:01:06,661 --> 02:01:08,910
The thing was that even at
design school for materials,

1959
02:01:08,911 --> 02:01:12,900
our brain and that did all right,
except it was so laborious.

1960
02:01:12,901 --> 02:01:13,800
I'd be down in the garage,

1961
02:01:13,801 --> 02:01:17,880
like zip tying things together
and have design all these cards.

1962
02:01:17,881 --> 02:01:20,580
And then get the stickers
and then like it just,

1963
02:01:20,640 --> 02:01:23,640
it took way too long versus
on how much we made. Um,

1964
02:01:24,510 --> 02:01:28,680
and so around this time I also have
a day job. What's Your Day job?

1965
02:01:28,740 --> 02:01:32,280
My Day job was I got a fellowship,
um,

1966
02:01:32,580 --> 02:01:36,060
from a book publisher
called Chronical Books. Yes.

1967
02:01:36,300 --> 02:01:40,460
And they had a fellowship, which is a
six month program for recent graduates.

1968
02:01:41,360 --> 02:01:44,450
Typically for graphic designers, they
introduced one for industrial designers.

1969
02:01:44,990 --> 02:01:46,850
I'm thinking, oh my God, this is perfect.

1970
02:01:47,780 --> 02:01:51,290
I've got a graphic design background
as well. Conoco makes beautiful,

1971
02:01:51,590 --> 02:01:55,820
beautiful books. They're books are
like objects, right. They really,

1972
02:01:56,180 --> 02:01:59,540
what I learned there was a about
the importance of detail and craft.

1973
02:01:59,930 --> 02:02:01,010
Now by fellowship,

1974
02:02:01,040 --> 02:02:06,040
I mean that sounds like you're
given a stipend to pursue your art,

1975
02:02:07,160 --> 02:02:11,150
but are you also, it was like a
glorified intern, glorified intern guy.

1976
02:02:11,360 --> 02:02:12,800
Much more attractive when
you call a fellowship.

1977
02:02:12,830 --> 02:02:16,280
It is much more desirable and it worked.

1978
02:02:16,310 --> 02:02:20,530
And I got that role for six months
and um, had a great time there. Um,

1979
02:02:20,660 --> 02:02:24,580
really got to work a long sentence
and worldclass graphic designers.

1980
02:02:24,590 --> 02:02:27,380
So that's how you're paying the bills.
While you're offering this free service.

1981
02:02:28,100 --> 02:02:32,570
And um, I eventually get in
a full time offer to take it.

1982
02:02:32,870 --> 02:02:36,260
And so I'm there doing industrial design
work, working on, on packaging for,

1983
02:02:36,261 --> 02:02:37,280
for high end books.

1984
02:02:37,310 --> 02:02:42,170
So they did the book for George Lucas
and star wars and I got to design the,

1985
02:02:42,530 --> 02:02:46,010
you know, the really high end case of
this book was huge. We'd like, you know,

1986
02:02:46,011 --> 02:02:49,580
it was like 20 pounds. It's like one of
those really thick coffee table books.

1987
02:02:50,120 --> 02:02:51,860
Did the package for Hugh Hefner.

1988
02:02:51,950 --> 02:02:55,520
He did a book on the centerfolds every
center fold since 1954 I believe,

1989
02:02:56,540 --> 02:02:57,590
starting with Marilyn Monroe.

1990
02:02:57,860 --> 02:03:02,860
And so I got to design this custom leather
briefcase that this book came in with

1991
02:03:03,051 --> 02:03:06,710
the blind and boss of the, um, the
playboy bunny on the front. Anyway,

1992
02:03:06,740 --> 02:03:08,030
there's a lot of cool projects there,

1993
02:03:08,660 --> 02:03:13,130
but at certain point equal collected
was growing and I realized it needed my

1994
02:03:13,131 --> 02:03:18,120
full time efforts. And so I made
a decision. I said, you know, um,

1995
02:03:18,740 --> 02:03:21,770
I need to either stick with this job,

1996
02:03:21,771 --> 02:03:23,150
which is getting very
comfortable at that time,

1997
02:03:23,180 --> 02:03:26,780
or I need to take this plunge insert
to really doing the startup full time.

1998
02:03:27,590 --> 02:03:31,730
And so, um, I quit my job since 2007,

1999
02:03:31,731 --> 02:03:33,360
2008 [inaudible]

2000
02:03:35,860 --> 02:03:38,450
job equal x and CritBuns full time.

2001
02:03:39,170 --> 02:03:44,170
And around this time the rent goes up in
her apartment and it's around this time

2002
02:03:44,541 --> 02:03:46,930
that my former classmate,
Brian Chesky museum with me,

2003
02:03:46,931 --> 02:03:51,931
you'd be my roommate and this is for
shadowing another major event in my life,

2004
02:03:52,071 --> 02:03:54,680
but we won't get there
just yet. All right. Um,

2005
02:03:55,100 --> 02:04:00,100
so make this plunge of stepping
into equal act and CritBuns.

2006
02:04:00,950 --> 02:04:04,130
Now all of this,
while I'm now living in San Francisco and

2007
02:04:05,900 --> 02:04:08,720
the thing is since high school,

2008
02:04:09,470 --> 02:04:12,020
since the first.com when
I was living in Atlanta,

2009
02:04:12,560 --> 02:04:17,360
I would come home every day and I would
be enthralled at the stories that I was

2010
02:04:17,361 --> 02:04:22,070
reading about of all these Internet
companies that were starting. You had, um,

2011
02:04:22,520 --> 02:04:22,790
you know,

2012
02:04:22,790 --> 02:04:27,790
Ebay and Amazon and Yahoo and excite.com
and Lycos and like there was so much

2013
02:04:29,360 --> 02:04:32,330
entrepreneurial spirit and I had this,

2014
02:04:32,690 --> 02:04:35,000
I had the sense that one day
I wanted to run my own thing.

2015
02:04:35,030 --> 02:04:38,070
I didn't know what was going to be
maybe as a gallery or something,

2016
02:04:38,071 --> 02:04:40,110
who knows if it was like what
kind of business it would be.

2017
02:04:41,300 --> 02:04:43,500
It's a chronicle was my
path out to San Francisco,

2018
02:04:43,501 --> 02:04:47,370
which is where I always wanted to be
because the first.com all paths lead back

2019
02:04:47,371 --> 02:04:50,580
to the, to the bay area. Oh
for sure. Right. And I'm like,

2020
02:04:50,581 --> 02:04:52,920
well that seems to be the place to go
if you want to get it off the ground.

2021
02:04:54,060 --> 02:04:57,330
And so I finally move out there.
I bring crit buns with me.

2022
02:04:57,890 --> 02:05:02,890
I bring the equalize concept with me
and I'm living in San Francisco and

2023
02:05:05,370 --> 02:05:08,280
during [inaudible] I had this,

2024
02:05:09,780 --> 02:05:13,320
this radar on in the back of my
mind that people that I met with,

2025
02:05:13,321 --> 02:05:14,154
friends that I made,

2026
02:05:14,310 --> 02:05:19,080
I sort of like trying to find somebody
else who had similar aspirations that I

2027
02:05:19,081 --> 02:05:19,380
did.

2028
02:05:19,380 --> 02:05:22,260
Somebody else who may want to co found
something with me in the future one day

2029
02:05:22,770 --> 02:05:24,570
and I can be a partner in
a business of some kind.

2030
02:05:25,500 --> 02:05:30,390
And so at the end of [inaudible] there
were very short list of people that I

2031
02:05:30,391 --> 02:05:32,910
felt I would just absolutely
love to start something with.

2032
02:05:33,180 --> 02:05:35,520
The guy at the top of the list
was this guy named Brian Chesky.

2033
02:05:36,480 --> 02:05:39,660
We got to know each other through sports
on campus because I ran the basketball

2034
02:05:39,661 --> 02:05:43,740
team, he ran the hockey team. So we
got to know each other via sports.

2035
02:05:44,490 --> 02:05:49,490
And there was one project that we had
together in industrial design were um,

2036
02:05:49,620 --> 02:05:54,570
it was for a client in the haircare
space and we got to reinvent haircare

2037
02:05:54,571 --> 02:05:56,370
products like blow
dryers and curling irons.

2038
02:05:56,940 --> 02:05:59,580
And for the final presentation,

2039
02:05:59,790 --> 02:06:04,790
Brian and I went in with this team and
our concepts were so wildly different

2040
02:06:04,831 --> 02:06:08,310
than everybody else's that I remember
looking at him being like, wow,

2041
02:06:08,340 --> 02:06:12,720
like this guy, when we're
in a room together, we can
do really creative things.

2042
02:06:13,800 --> 02:06:17,550
And as the year went on
and before we graduated,

2043
02:06:17,580 --> 02:06:19,350
I just had this growing feeling that like,

2044
02:06:20,040 --> 02:06:23,130
there's something special about this guy.
He knew how to rally people together.

2045
02:06:23,131 --> 02:06:25,250
He knew how to get them excited.
Uh,

2046
02:06:25,260 --> 02:06:30,000
he had his own project around fitness
that he got people to volunteer their time

2047
02:06:30,240 --> 02:06:32,670
to help do design on and marketing on.

2048
02:06:33,300 --> 02:06:35,040
And I just remember being
really inspired by him.

2049
02:06:35,910 --> 02:06:38,730
And it's the night before graduation,

2050
02:06:39,270 --> 02:06:42,950
he's about to move to Los Angeles.
I'm about to, you know, um,

2051
02:06:43,170 --> 02:06:44,970
I was gonna stay in providence
to work on crit buns

2052
02:06:46,560 --> 02:06:50,370
and I decided to invite him out to
dinner to tell him how I feel about this.

2053
02:06:50,550 --> 02:06:54,810
And so over a slice of pizza
on Thayer street. I tell
him, and Brian, I go, Brian,

2054
02:06:55,380 --> 02:06:57,690
I just want you to know, I think we're
going to start a company one day.

2055
02:06:58,590 --> 02:07:02,130
I think they're gonna write a book about
it. And he kind of laughed it off, Huh?

2056
02:07:02,160 --> 02:07:05,970
Yeah, yeah. And um, he ends
up going to Los Angeles.

2057
02:07:06,930 --> 02:07:10,590
I ended up finding my way to San Francisco
via chronicle books and very quickly,

2058
02:07:10,591 --> 02:07:11,460
once I'm in San Francisco,

2059
02:07:11,461 --> 02:07:14,550
recognize that it is in fact an
epicenter for entrepreneurship.

2060
02:07:14,760 --> 02:07:16,350
There's so much activity
going on around me.

2061
02:07:16,351 --> 02:07:21,030
Web 2.0 is like the web is back and
I'm start calling them like, Brian,

2062
02:07:21,360 --> 02:07:23,400
I know what's going on in la,
but you gotta get up here.

2063
02:07:23,401 --> 02:07:27,540
Like there's so much activity,
so much action happening
here. And he's like, yeah,

2064
02:07:27,541 --> 02:07:27,961
yeah,

2065
02:07:27,961 --> 02:07:31,800
I got some stuff going and like this
one on for at least a year of trying to

2066
02:07:31,801 --> 02:07:36,070
recruit him to get up to San Francisco.
And so at a certain point,

2067
02:07:36,071 --> 02:07:39,640
the roommates that I was living with
moved out and I'm left with this three

2068
02:07:39,641 --> 02:07:42,790
bedroom apartment and I call him like,
Brian,

2069
02:07:44,350 --> 02:07:48,400
I've got a room available. It's now
or never, if you're going to move,

2070
02:07:48,610 --> 02:07:50,530
this is the perfect
window to come up here.

2071
02:07:50,830 --> 02:07:55,210
I've got a room waiting for you with your
name on it and have to give him a lot

2072
02:07:55,211 --> 02:07:58,780
of credit. He made a courageous
move. He quit his job,

2073
02:07:59,290 --> 02:08:02,020
he packed his life into his Honda Civic.

2074
02:08:02,380 --> 02:08:06,960
And he drove from Los Angeles to San
Francisco, became a roommate, asks,

2075
02:08:07,030 --> 02:08:10,000
sorry Tim. There was this
incredible excitement in the air.

2076
02:08:10,540 --> 02:08:14,230
Like it's like the band is back together.
All right, what are we going to do?

2077
02:08:14,260 --> 02:08:16,660
Like what could we
possibly create together?

2078
02:08:17,350 --> 02:08:19,660
And this is the same week that
I quit my job at chronicle.

2079
02:08:20,470 --> 02:08:22,240
I've got CritBuns and he
collected in the background.

2080
02:08:22,750 --> 02:08:25,600
We're going to come up with something
big together. Uh, Brian and I,

2081
02:08:26,470 --> 02:08:28,450
and that's when I opened the mail.
One day,

2082
02:08:28,840 --> 02:08:33,670
that same week he arrives as a
letter from my landlord and it says,

2083
02:08:33,671 --> 02:08:37,360
Dear Joe,
your rent is now 25% higher.

2084
02:08:38,920 --> 02:08:41,290
And I run to my online bank
account and I see that, um,

2085
02:08:42,340 --> 02:08:44,740
I should not have enough money in the
bank because I have no paychecks coming in

2086
02:08:45,100 --> 02:08:45,880
to make rents.

2087
02:08:45,880 --> 02:08:49,840
Brian has the same problem and suddenly
our backs are against the wall.

2088
02:08:49,940 --> 02:08:52,420
This is like this dark,
stormy cloud that forms of her apartment.

2089
02:08:52,630 --> 02:08:55,150
All the enthusiasm's gone.
Now it's just terror and fear.

2090
02:08:55,630 --> 02:08:58,810
How are we not going to get evicted next
month? We need to make the rent check.

2091
02:08:59,440 --> 02:09:01,240
And that's what I'm
sitting in my living room.

2092
02:09:01,241 --> 02:09:06,241
One day that week I've got my laptop
open and I'm looking at the website for a

2093
02:09:06,461 --> 02:09:09,860
design conference for industrial designers
coming to San Francisco, you know,

2094
02:09:10,060 --> 02:09:13,090
two weeks later and it
says in big red letters,

2095
02:09:13,210 --> 02:09:15,970
hotels are sold out in San
Francisco. I'm thinking, Oh man,

2096
02:09:15,971 --> 02:09:18,100
what a bummer for somebody
who wants to come last minute.

2097
02:09:18,101 --> 02:09:19,060
They've got nowhere to stay.

2098
02:09:19,660 --> 02:09:24,190
And I glance over the top of the laptop
screen into the vast space of the living

2099
02:09:24,191 --> 02:09:26,650
room and start to think,

2100
02:09:27,850 --> 02:09:31,750
what if I pull my air bed out of the
closet and blowed up on the four?

2101
02:09:31,810 --> 02:09:35,740
We could host a designer for less than
the cost of hotel and maybe make some

2102
02:09:35,800 --> 02:09:39,820
money to make our rent check.
So email Brian,

2103
02:09:40,960 --> 02:09:41,950
and he loves the idea.

2104
02:09:42,340 --> 02:09:46,090
We actually get to more airbeds and we
start to think through this experience.

2105
02:09:46,450 --> 02:09:49,030
What if we offered airport pickup?

2106
02:09:49,960 --> 02:09:54,910
What if we gave them a map to San
Francisco in a bart pass at subway and we

2107
02:09:54,911 --> 02:09:56,110
cooked them breakfast in the morning.

2108
02:09:57,220 --> 02:10:01,810
And so we created this concept
called the air bed and breakfast.

2109
02:10:04,600 --> 02:10:08,470
We made a website, air bed and
breakfast.com it was four pages,

2110
02:10:08,471 --> 02:10:10,600
pictures of us pictures of their beds.

2111
02:10:11,230 --> 02:10:15,700
We talked about the neighborhood and we
were so proud of her website except who

2112
02:10:15,701 --> 02:10:17,530
the hell on earth knew who to go to?
Air Bed and breakfast.

2113
02:10:19,150 --> 02:10:22,540
Not exactly a high volume search term.
Right.

2114
02:10:22,630 --> 02:10:26,920
So one night we realized that
we have a marketing problem.

2115
02:10:28,120 --> 02:10:30,160
The conferences coming up pretty quick,
I mean you get the word out.

2116
02:10:30,610 --> 02:10:33,190
So we email the design blogs,

2117
02:10:33,200 --> 02:10:36,860
the top design blogs that were covering
the conference and neither of us had

2118
02:10:36,861 --> 02:10:41,861
really been on design blogs before other
than equal act and crit buns and it was

2119
02:10:42,411 --> 02:10:43,280
kind of a hail Mary.

2120
02:10:43,310 --> 02:10:48,310
We just sent these emails out to like
press tips at [inaudible] dot com the next

2121
02:10:49,251 --> 02:10:51,800
morning we came down,
we opened our computers and Tim,

2122
02:10:51,801 --> 02:10:53,750
it felt like Christmas there.

2123
02:10:53,751 --> 02:10:57,710
We were at the top of the design blogs
with headlines like need a place for the

2124
02:10:57,711 --> 02:11:01,620
conference this weekend crash with
Joe and Brian and there's some a loft.

2125
02:11:02,090 --> 02:11:05,180
Amazing networking. Your jam jam
is on an air bed and breakfast.

2126
02:11:07,130 --> 02:11:12,130
And this idea that we had a week or two
earlier was now being blogged about to

2127
02:11:12,621 --> 02:11:16,250
the world in the design community.
And so they responded.

2128
02:11:16,760 --> 02:11:20,150
We had emails from all over the world,
from Brazil, from England, from Japan,

2129
02:11:20,151 --> 02:11:25,070
of people dying to have one of
these airbeds in our living room.

2130
02:11:26,060 --> 02:11:30,230
People started sending us their linkedin
profiles and this design portfolios and

2131
02:11:30,231 --> 02:11:32,840
the resumes being like,

2132
02:11:32,870 --> 02:11:35,510
I was trying to convince us to pick them
to be one of the lucky three guests.

2133
02:11:35,760 --> 02:11:38,990
Amazing. At one point, my phone rings
with an area code that was unfamiliar.

2134
02:11:39,230 --> 02:11:41,180
I didn't answer it.
Suddenly have a voicemail,

2135
02:11:41,210 --> 02:11:45,350
I'm listening to the voicemail and it's
this guide named a mole who's telling me

2136
02:11:45,351 --> 02:11:46,800
he's going,
my name's mole.

2137
02:11:46,910 --> 02:11:49,610
And I just saw the air bed and breakfast
concept and I have to stay with you

2138
02:11:49,611 --> 02:11:52,820
guys, call me back. Uh, I, I have to
stay at the air bed and breakfast.

2139
02:11:53,090 --> 02:11:54,020
Here's my phone number.

2140
02:11:54,530 --> 02:11:57,110
And then in my inbox I've got like
two emails from this guy. I'm like,

2141
02:11:57,111 --> 02:11:59,260
how did he find me information?
Um,

2142
02:11:59,450 --> 02:12:02,740
so I called him back and he sends
his design portfolio checks out.

2143
02:12:02,750 --> 02:12:07,750
He's a Grad student at Arizona State
University studying industrial design and

2144
02:12:10,100 --> 02:12:13,460
he becomes our first guests and
then we accept two other people.

2145
02:12:13,461 --> 02:12:16,700
One woman named Kat and another
gentleman named Michael.

2146
02:12:17,090 --> 02:12:22,090
All were over the age of 30 cat was
a single soul traveler from Boston.

2147
02:12:22,770 --> 02:12:27,770
Michael was a 45 year old husband and
father of five from Utah and there was all

2148
02:12:28,761 --> 02:12:32,180
this excitement when the guests arrive.
It's like, you know, we made sure the bed,

2149
02:12:32,210 --> 02:12:35,780
the air beds were properly inflated.
There was a mint on the pillow.

2150
02:12:36,280 --> 02:12:38,480
Like we cleaned the place up in advance,

2151
02:12:38,481 --> 02:12:43,100
we stock the fridge with Oj and
bagels and you know, fresh eggs.

2152
02:12:43,160 --> 02:12:48,160
And we had everything ready
to go as to tell you Tim,

2153
02:12:49,400 --> 02:12:53,240
the next couple of nights were just some
of the most exciting cause this thing

2154
02:12:53,241 --> 02:12:57,830
unfolded that we didn't expect, which
is that, yeah, we made some money on it,

2155
02:12:58,010 --> 02:13:01,670
but more than that week we became friends
with them and we really get to show

2156
02:13:01,671 --> 02:13:03,800
them San Francisco through the lens of,

2157
02:13:03,860 --> 02:13:08,120
of us through our favorite things to do,
our favorite places to eat.

2158
02:13:08,720 --> 02:13:10,430
Imagine the difference of this yard,
a conference,

2159
02:13:11,600 --> 02:13:16,600
and at the end of the day you can retire
by herself to a hotel room that maybe

2160
02:13:17,660 --> 02:13:22,660
is so much generic or lacks and general
personality or why they came back to our

2161
02:13:24,411 --> 02:13:26,690
apartment, which was lively.
We're cooking dinner together.

2162
02:13:26,691 --> 02:13:28,670
We're sharing stories from
our days at the conference.

2163
02:13:28,970 --> 02:13:32,070
It was like night and day for them
and they had such a good experience.

2164
02:13:32,071 --> 02:13:36,510
We took her to her friend's house
parties after the conference some nights.

2165
02:13:36,510 --> 02:13:40,530
We took them to the best burritos in the
mission district to the farmer's market

2166
02:13:40,531 --> 02:13:44,560
at the ferry building
one morning. And, um,

2167
02:13:44,970 --> 02:13:49,290
at one point we gave during great
place to take visitors very building.

2168
02:13:49,620 --> 02:13:53,260
There was a Pechakucha talk
during the conference, Eric,

2169
02:13:53,470 --> 02:13:55,740
who's a Woah at what chocolate you,
it's that,

2170
02:13:56,060 --> 02:14:00,240
it's that format where you have 20
slides in like four minutes I've right.

2171
02:14:00,480 --> 02:14:05,310
And so I just moved and you got to give
a quick presentation and so we gave a

2172
02:14:05,311 --> 02:14:08,970
presentation about air bed and breakfast
in the moment that we're hosting people

2173
02:14:08,971 --> 02:14:11,730
in air bed and breakfast and we had our
guests up there with us and talked about

2174
02:14:11,731 --> 02:14:13,560
this concept that came together,
you know,

2175
02:14:13,561 --> 02:14:17,220
two weeks ago is now actually
unfolding in front of us right now.

2176
02:14:17,640 --> 02:14:21,150
And it was just like really met a moment
where the guests are now part of the

2177
02:14:21,151 --> 02:14:25,500
presentation about themselves
and it was totally insane.

2178
02:14:25,650 --> 02:14:30,650
Let's step five of the CritBuns
Aka airbnb sales process.

2179
02:14:30,871 --> 02:14:34,830
You're the story. So I'll never
forget when saying goodbye to them.

2180
02:14:34,831 --> 02:14:38,550
The door click closed and I
look at Brian and I'm like,

2181
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:40,440
did we just get paid to make friends?

2182
02:14:41,730 --> 02:14:44,010
And that Tim is when
the gears began to turn,

2183
02:14:46,050 --> 02:14:49,080
maybe there were other people like us
who would also enjoy sharing their extra

2184
02:14:49,081 --> 02:14:53,430
space with people coming to their town
and want who want a local experience.

2185
02:14:54,750 --> 02:14:57,990
And so we told my previous roommate Nate,

2186
02:14:58,920 --> 02:15:03,630
who I found on craigslist, he was a
computer science graduate from Harvard

2187
02:15:05,220 --> 02:15:07,350
who when he moved out,
Brian moved into his room.

2188
02:15:07,860 --> 02:15:12,860
And now Nate story with him is we lived
together for a couple of months and at

2189
02:15:14,131 --> 02:15:17,250
night we come home from our day jobs and
we were working on our own projects in

2190
02:15:17,251 --> 02:15:18,720
the living room.
I was working on CritBuns.

2191
02:15:18,990 --> 02:15:22,410
Nate was working on his own
startups and it was remarkable.

2192
02:15:22,410 --> 02:15:25,470
I'm looking over my shoulder thing
and wow, this guy loves to work.

2193
02:15:26,100 --> 02:15:29,190
We have similar work ethics. And I'm like,
if I ever need a computer programmer,

2194
02:15:29,850 --> 02:15:33,510
I'm going to call a neat little did I
know that Nate was thinking the same thing

2195
02:15:33,511 --> 02:15:35,820
about me. Pretty designer McAllen, Joe.

2196
02:15:37,650 --> 02:15:39,570
So Nate moves out,

2197
02:15:39,571 --> 02:15:44,430
Brian moves in and after this one weekend,

2198
02:15:44,790 --> 02:15:46,320
um,
yeah,

2199
02:15:46,321 --> 02:15:49,920
a couple months actually passed
and we didn't move on the concepts.

2200
02:15:50,310 --> 02:15:52,710
We went home for new year's that year.

2201
02:15:52,711 --> 02:15:56,930
This is 2007 so it happened in October.
We go home for new years in,

2202
02:15:56,931 --> 02:16:01,680
in 2007 and in their invariably
people ask you, hey, how's it going?

2203
02:16:01,710 --> 02:16:04,770
What are you working on? What's
going on in San Francisco? Um,

2204
02:16:04,800 --> 02:16:07,700
and like were entrepreneurs and they
go, great, what are you entrepreneurial?

2205
02:16:08,980 --> 02:16:10,710
And I didn't really have a lot going on.

2206
02:16:10,711 --> 02:16:15,690
Coupons is kind of their eclipse kind
of, you know, uh, struggling along. Um,

2207
02:16:16,110 --> 02:16:17,430
there's no funding at this point.

2208
02:16:18,120 --> 02:16:20,730
But I did tell people about this crazy
weekend where he had these three guests

2209
02:16:20,880 --> 02:16:25,500
on airbeds in our apartment and it
was remarkable what happened next.

2210
02:16:26,190 --> 02:16:29,590
People either leaned in and he
went, oh my God, that's amazing.

2211
02:16:29,620 --> 02:16:31,810
I would love to travel
and stay with the vocal.

2212
02:16:32,950 --> 02:16:35,920
And the other half of the people
went, oh my God, you're crazy.

2213
02:16:36,040 --> 02:16:39,040
You had a stranger in your home.
What were you thinking?

2214
02:16:40,180 --> 02:16:45,180
And this lake visceral reaction that the
cause people in these conversations was

2215
02:16:45,761 --> 02:16:49,870
like, wow, like this really gets
people fired up and either direction,

2216
02:16:50,490 --> 02:16:54,130
maybe there's something here. It's a
Brian. And we come back in January.

2217
02:16:54,131 --> 02:16:58,510
Brian comes back, he's from New
York, upstate. He comes back and um,

2218
02:16:59,230 --> 02:17:02,470
we sh we had similar experiences. He's
like, yeah, I told people about it.

2219
02:17:02,471 --> 02:17:05,950
Any of that loved it or hated it. And
we're like, yeah, like maybe we should,

2220
02:17:06,400 --> 02:17:10,840
maybe this is the idea that we should
expand on. So we're like, okay,

2221
02:17:10,930 --> 02:17:15,240
we know we need a real programmer. So I'm
like, well, I'm going to call an Natan.

2222
02:17:15,780 --> 02:17:16,720
So get a drink with Nate.

2223
02:17:16,721 --> 02:17:20,590
I tell him about this crazy weekend with
these three guests. Nate loves the idea.

2224
02:17:20,770 --> 02:17:21,603
He's like,
wait,

2225
02:17:21,820 --> 02:17:25,870
we can use the Internet to get people
offline back into the real world with each

2226
02:17:25,871 --> 02:17:28,060
other. It's like, I would
love to spend my time on this.

2227
02:17:28,900 --> 02:17:33,900
So at this point we think the big
opportunity is a website for conferences,

2228
02:17:36,790 --> 02:17:40,000
for people to sleep on airbeds
and living rooms. This,

2229
02:17:40,350 --> 02:17:43,690
it turns out as a very narrow market.
We did not know this at the time.

2230
02:17:44,530 --> 02:17:47,980
So our logical next step is what's
the next big conference coming up?

2231
02:17:47,981 --> 02:17:52,450
We're hotels will sell out. Well, it
turns out that right here in Austin,

2232
02:17:53,320 --> 02:17:57,940
every march, it was quite a large
conference called south by southwest.

2233
02:17:58,360 --> 02:18:03,360
It also happens to be the place where
some preeminent tech companies went to

2234
02:18:03,551 --> 02:18:05,440
launch and took off like rocket ships,

2235
02:18:05,441 --> 02:18:10,030
including four square and Twitter and
some others. What year was this? 2008.

2236
02:18:10,760 --> 02:18:11,593
It's,
we're like,

2237
02:18:12,340 --> 02:18:15,650
we're going to build the next version
for south by southwest and this going to

2238
02:18:15,651 --> 02:18:20,530
take off just like the others.
So Nate hunkers down with us,

2239
02:18:20,531 --> 02:18:23,890
we start to code out of the next more
robust version of the site becomes more

2240
02:18:23,891 --> 02:18:28,891
than just four pages and we pull
all nighters for like two weeks.

2241
02:18:30,220 --> 02:18:35,170
And we watched Justin time for south
by South West and all this excitement,

2242
02:18:35,171 --> 02:18:38,770
all of this energy. Tim, we've
got a total of five hosts,

2243
02:18:41,020 --> 02:18:44,530
two reservations.
I'm no mathematician,

2244
02:18:44,531 --> 02:18:48,490
but that ratio doesn't sound favorable.
Well, one of the reservations was us.

2245
02:18:50,820 --> 02:18:55,160
It's actually Brian. Um, and, um,

2246
02:18:55,550 --> 02:18:57,790
Brian stayed with this guy here in Austin,

2247
02:18:58,270 --> 02:19:03,270
Mtn Dung and he had everything laid out
and he had the pillow and the towels and

2248
02:19:04,481 --> 02:19:09,170
the men's and some like, um, some
soup cooking in the background.

2249
02:19:09,171 --> 02:19:13,070
And he's a great host, right? He's taken
really seriously here at this time.

2250
02:19:13,490 --> 02:19:15,960
Like [inaudible] it was just
a classified service. Right.

2251
02:19:15,961 --> 02:19:20,680
And you came and you paid
somebody on a rival and Brian, um,

2252
02:19:21,670 --> 02:19:26,670
Brian tells the story that he forgot
to go to the ATM machine and so he gets

2253
02:19:29,121 --> 02:19:34,121
there and he goes through the whole night
and wakes up the next day and the host

2254
02:19:34,190 --> 02:19:38,780
has to awkwardly ask him, by the
way, where's my money? And runs like,

2255
02:19:38,840 --> 02:19:43,250
oh no, shoot, I forgot. I'll go to the
ATM today. Brian Forgot to go to the ATM.

2256
02:19:43,280 --> 02:19:48,110
Another night goes by this point. The
host is like, what kind of joke is this?

2257
02:19:48,650 --> 02:19:52,070
These guys just make a website to
freeload accommodations when they travel.

2258
02:19:52,820 --> 02:19:57,500
And so, um, Brian eventually
got to the ATM and paid him,

2259
02:19:57,560 --> 02:19:59,960
but he said that experience
was incredibly awkward.

2260
02:19:59,961 --> 02:20:04,820
Paint somebody cash and person inside
their home as like just not a great

2261
02:20:04,821 --> 02:20:08,170
experience. So afterwards, you know,

2262
02:20:09,150 --> 02:20:11,510
it was not a successful launch whatsoever.

2263
02:20:11,511 --> 02:20:13,490
I think we got one mentioned on Mashable,

2264
02:20:14,450 --> 02:20:18,620
like it was dismal and we debrief
on the whole thing and we,

2265
02:20:18,680 --> 02:20:23,090
we realized two things because we are
getting emails from people who are like,

2266
02:20:23,091 --> 02:20:27,950
Hey, I want to stay in a home but
there's no conference in the city.

2267
02:20:27,951 --> 02:20:31,340
How do I use your service?
And so we realized something,

2268
02:20:31,341 --> 02:20:33,080
well maybe this is more than
a conference website made.

2269
02:20:33,130 --> 02:20:34,250
This is just a travel website.

2270
02:20:35,300 --> 02:20:38,680
And what if we got rid of the awkwardness
of payments in person and allowed

2271
02:20:38,681 --> 02:20:40,880
people to pay with a credit
card in advance online?

2272
02:20:41,420 --> 02:20:44,270
And we just removed that whole
awkwardness from the customer experience.

2273
02:20:44,930 --> 02:20:48,440
And in doing so, we're like, wait, if
we did the trans, the transaction line,

2274
02:20:48,470 --> 02:20:52,340
we could take a small transaction
fee and a business model was born.

2275
02:20:53,650 --> 02:20:56,470
Um, and so at this point, uh,

2276
02:20:56,480 --> 02:21:00,820
Nate needed a little bit more enthusiasm
to get back involved in, in, in the,

2277
02:21:00,850 --> 02:21:05,180
in the concept. Um,
uh, of the three of us,

2278
02:21:05,181 --> 02:21:06,710
we all balance each other out really well.

2279
02:21:07,070 --> 02:21:10,400
Nate's the pragmatist of all
three of us. So he, you know,

2280
02:21:10,800 --> 02:21:14,630
helps ground us in reality and, and
progress and shipping things. Well.

2281
02:21:14,840 --> 02:21:17,120
Sometimes Brian and I can be, have
her head in the clouds and, and,

2282
02:21:17,121 --> 02:21:21,620
and really dream, um, it's
a perfect balance. And,

2283
02:21:22,420 --> 02:21:26,600
uh, Nate needs some convincing
that this can actually work.

2284
02:21:27,380 --> 02:21:29,120
So in the summer of 2008,

2285
02:21:30,260 --> 02:21:35,260
we realized that we could use some kind
of event to give this thing a spark for

2286
02:21:35,421 --> 02:21:36,320
this thing to take off.

2287
02:21:36,680 --> 02:21:40,370
And if you remember back in 2008
when everybody was talking about,

2288
02:21:41,390 --> 02:21:44,330
especially in the summertime,
the year of a presidential election,

2289
02:21:45,590 --> 02:21:47,660
John McCain versus Barack Obama

2290
02:21:49,160 --> 02:21:53,930
and Obama was attracting these
historic record breaking crowds.

2291
02:21:53,931 --> 02:21:56,240
He spoke in Portland to 75,000 people.

2292
02:21:57,140 --> 02:22:02,140
And it was identified
in June that the DNC,

2293
02:22:02,691 --> 02:22:06,340
the Democratic National
Convention later that August, um,

2294
02:22:07,130 --> 02:22:12,130
there was going to be a bit of a problem
because they moved the venue from the

2295
02:22:12,141 --> 02:22:15,470
basketball arena of 20,000
seats to Invesco Stadium,

2296
02:22:15,471 --> 02:22:20,330
which had 100,000 seats to attract more
people to come to Denver to see Obama

2297
02:22:20,331 --> 02:22:21,164
speak.

2298
02:22:22,550 --> 02:22:25,380
Therein lies a problem with the amount
of housing that exists in Denver.

2299
02:22:25,410 --> 02:22:28,800
They have 20,000 hotel rooms. Most of
them were already taken up by delegates.

2300
02:22:29,670 --> 02:22:33,900
And the headwind started to read
housing crisis in pending on Denver.

2301
02:22:34,320 --> 02:22:37,500
The mayor started holding pressure press
conferences to say he might open the

2302
02:22:37,501 --> 02:22:40,650
city parks for people to pitch tents
cause there was nowhere to sleep.

2303
02:22:41,940 --> 02:22:43,260
So we recognize and say,
wait,

2304
02:22:43,261 --> 02:22:47,040
what if we relaunched in time for the
DNC so we can ride the coattails of all

2305
02:22:47,041 --> 02:22:51,060
this press to gain awareness for
our, the next iteration of, of air,

2306
02:22:51,061 --> 02:22:55,050
bed and breakfast. So Nate
love the idea, we hunker down,

2307
02:22:55,290 --> 02:22:58,680
we spend the summer rebuilding the site
with online payments and the ability to

2308
02:22:58,681 --> 02:23:02,280
travel anywhere at anytime.
So this was the carrot for Nate,

2309
02:23:02,281 --> 02:23:06,510
was Nate needed to know that
there was some reliable,

2310
02:23:07,130 --> 02:23:07,560
you know,

2311
02:23:07,560 --> 02:23:11,580
mechanism to create awareness on the
horizon because to build a marketplace

2312
02:23:12,060 --> 02:23:16,040
without any awareness is like,
you know, the difficult civil,

2313
02:23:16,041 --> 02:23:19,540
the least difficult to say the least.
Um,

2314
02:23:19,590 --> 02:23:22,680
so we hit the ground in Denver.
We,

2315
02:23:23,340 --> 02:23:24,690
I remember we built a website,

2316
02:23:24,870 --> 02:23:27,990
this shiny new version of air bed and
breakfast and began on the phone with

2317
02:23:27,991 --> 02:23:30,030
press trying to pitch them like
we had no idea what we were doing.

2318
02:23:30,780 --> 02:23:34,170
I'm on the phone with ca like CNN
and they basically hang up on me,

2319
02:23:34,710 --> 02:23:38,330
but I've experienced with that from
some other projects in the past. Um,

2320
02:23:38,331 --> 02:23:42,150
so I'm like, I'm just gonna keep
going. And sw scared. Plus WC goes,

2321
02:23:42,151 --> 02:23:43,770
I'm all beautiful memory.

2322
02:23:45,300 --> 02:23:48,150
So what we learned,

2323
02:23:48,151 --> 02:23:51,210
what will we started to do is actually
contact a local bloggers in Denver.

2324
02:23:52,260 --> 02:23:53,730
Like CNN is not gonna answer a call,

2325
02:23:53,910 --> 02:23:58,380
but a local blogger loved
the story because it was of
their neighborhoods. And,

2326
02:23:58,620 --> 02:24:02,850
um, it was very human oriented of Denver
residents opening their homes to support

2327
02:24:02,970 --> 02:24:06,280
other fellow Obama supporters.
Um,

2328
02:24:06,930 --> 02:24:10,890
and so these blogs would write about it
and it turns out that's where like the

2329
02:24:10,891 --> 02:24:12,240
newspapers look for story ideas.

2330
02:24:12,750 --> 02:24:16,200
So in the newspapers wrote about him
and turns out that's where the local TV

2331
02:24:16,201 --> 02:24:17,700
broadcast,
it looks for story ideas.

2332
02:24:17,910 --> 02:24:22,910
So then we get a call from
NBC local affiliate and when
NBC does a story CBS and

2333
02:24:23,011 --> 02:24:26,970
ABC short we follow. So then we've
got the Denver press covered.

2334
02:24:27,150 --> 02:24:30,510
It turns out that's what the boulder
press looks to you for story ideas and be

2335
02:24:30,511 --> 02:24:34,770
started to become a regional story and
turns out when you have regional story,

2336
02:24:35,010 --> 02:24:39,120
that's what CNN looks to you for story
ideas. So within a matter of about

2337
02:24:40,740 --> 02:24:41,700
two to three weeks,

2338
02:24:42,060 --> 02:24:46,110
we went from zero listings in Denver to
800 people sharing their homes just to

2339
02:24:46,111 --> 02:24:48,720
this awareness through press. Again,
we had no money like there was,

2340
02:24:48,990 --> 02:24:52,230
we could hire like a PR firm,
we can like go buy online ads.

2341
02:24:52,231 --> 02:24:55,350
Like this is all just word of mouth,
like the press talking about us.

2342
02:24:56,780 --> 02:25:01,230
And then we get the call from CNN and
there was this funny moment where Brian

2343
02:25:01,231 --> 02:25:05,940
and I are doing a live interview in her
living room on a laptop through like

2344
02:25:05,941 --> 02:25:09,560
Skype or something. And we have,
we're sharing like earbuds,

2345
02:25:10,250 --> 02:25:12,750
what it looked like were conjoined to
each other because they're sitting so

2346
02:25:12,751 --> 02:25:17,520
close and we're doing this live interview
with this Guy Errol Barnett on CNN and

2347
02:25:17,521 --> 02:25:20,880
talking about this website and what it
means to people to be able to stay in a

2348
02:25:20,881 --> 02:25:25,000
home, uh, for anybody going
to the DNC. And it was,

2349
02:25:25,060 --> 02:25:28,660
and then when he'd have a CNN story,
that's what international press look to,

2350
02:25:28,810 --> 02:25:32,750
to create stories. Then Lamond
picks us up and the Guardian, um,

2351
02:25:32,920 --> 02:25:34,330
and press out in Europe.

2352
02:25:34,750 --> 02:25:39,750
And it's just amazing to see what happens
when an idea or a story starts at the

2353
02:25:40,601 --> 02:25:44,920
smallest nugget and works
its way up this chain, right,

2354
02:25:44,921 --> 02:25:49,270
to becoming an international story in
a matter of three or so weeks. Amazing.

2355
02:25:49,480 --> 02:25:51,460
You know, I have to give credit to, um,

2356
02:25:52,060 --> 02:25:56,590
to Seth Goden because I remember
during Crippen's I read his book,

2357
02:25:56,591 --> 02:25:57,700
all marketers are liars.

2358
02:25:58,660 --> 02:26:02,410
And I remember something that he
says in there, which I never forgot,

2359
02:26:02,411 --> 02:26:06,730
which is to make something
people want to talk about. Right.

2360
02:26:06,731 --> 02:26:07,600
It's like purple cow.

2361
02:26:07,601 --> 02:26:10,450
It's like make something that's distinct
enough that people want to talk about

2362
02:26:10,451 --> 02:26:11,770
it and it's differentiated enough.

2363
02:26:12,490 --> 02:26:17,490
And I feel like that concept was imbued
into like the early days of the company,

2364
02:26:19,250 --> 02:26:22,930
certainly decrypt buns and he collected
and definitely to air bed and breakfast

2365
02:26:22,931 --> 02:26:23,764
at the time.

2366
02:26:24,460 --> 02:26:27,550
And certainly if I watched it happen in
front of me making something that people

2367
02:26:27,551 --> 02:26:31,840
want to talk about, go from a local
Denver blogger story to international

2368
02:26:31,890 --> 02:26:34,890
press soon as it, is it safe to
say, would you consider that the,

2369
02:26:35,760 --> 02:26:40,760
the first or one of the first major
successful milestones for urban breakfast?

2370
02:26:42,540 --> 02:26:46,800
Yes, because we had um, a few hundred
people staying on the site that weekend,

2371
02:26:46,830 --> 02:26:50,160
including us. We got to go to
Denver. So Nate was busy. Hey,

2372
02:26:50,161 --> 02:26:52,880
Nate was really busy so we
had divide responsibilities.

2373
02:26:52,881 --> 02:26:54,570
It's just three of us needs
to do in all the coding.

2374
02:26:54,720 --> 02:26:57,660
Brian's handling all the press and I'm
handling all the design and the customer

2375
02:26:57,661 --> 02:27:01,290
service.
So let me hit pause and let me ask you,

2376
02:27:01,950 --> 02:27:06,690
would it make sense? And we can, we
can certainly decide on the fly here,

2377
02:27:06,720 --> 02:27:09,900
but we've got about probably
like close to three hours.

2378
02:27:10,230 --> 02:27:15,230
Would it make sense to have this be part
one and then follow up with a part two?

2379
02:27:17,340 --> 02:27:21,870
Oh, what do you think of that? We don't
have to, we don't have to, but we could.

2380
02:27:21,960 --> 02:27:26,400
What are your thoughts? Um, I'm open
to it and recorded another time. Yeah.

2381
02:27:26,760 --> 02:27:28,940
I'm just thinking like,
this is totally, yeah. We,

2382
02:27:28,950 --> 02:27:32,010
let's get people on a cliff hanger. This
is, I think this is a good cliffhanger.

2383
02:27:32,030 --> 02:27:36,030
Okay. So then I'll say, yeah. Okay. Go.
No, no, no, no, no. Go for it. Yeah.

2384
02:27:36,600 --> 02:27:40,780
I mean, because this like, this
deserves around too. So, so we had it.

2385
02:27:41,060 --> 02:27:43,460
It's, we had a few hundred people
actually using the service.

2386
02:27:44,690 --> 02:27:47,240
Brian and I split up responsibilities.
Nate doing doings, coding,

2387
02:27:47,480 --> 02:27:48,650
Brian's Zuni held the press.

2388
02:27:49,010 --> 02:27:51,170
I'm doing all the customer
service from my cell phone

2389
02:27:52,350 --> 02:27:53,870
and we have this incredible weekend

2390
02:27:54,210 --> 02:27:58,290
where our marketplace is working.
But you won't imagine what happens next.

2391
02:27:59,660 --> 02:28:02,240
Ooh.
dot.dot.

2392
02:28:05,150 --> 02:28:08,720
Okay. Amazing. No, this is perfect.
This is absolutely perfect. Uh,

2393
02:28:08,990 --> 02:28:12,130
so to be continued,
uh,

2394
02:28:13,730 --> 02:28:17,030
in the meantime,
as sort of a,

2395
02:28:17,090 --> 02:28:21,750
a temporary, uh, tie of,

2396
02:28:21,820 --> 02:28:22,940
of part one,

2397
02:28:23,930 --> 02:28:28,930
is there anything that you would
like people to take from this,

2398
02:28:30,020 --> 02:28:32,150
this first chronology that
we've walked people through?

2399
02:28:32,630 --> 02:28:37,280
Any ask of the audience or recommendation,
suggestion,

2400
02:28:38,030 --> 02:28:40,850
uh, that you would like
parting words of any type?

2401
02:28:43,140 --> 02:28:45,600
I think anytime that you introduce
a new idea into the world, there's,

2402
02:28:45,780 --> 02:28:49,880
there's bound to be somebody
or many people who rejected.

2403
02:28:50,800 --> 02:28:53,970
I think rejection is inevitable. Anytime
you're trying something new. In fact,

2404
02:28:53,971 --> 02:28:55,080
I'd say if you're not getting rejected,

2405
02:28:55,081 --> 02:28:57,270
you're probably not
trying to anything new.

2406
02:28:57,271 --> 02:29:00,240
Like you're probably not even
pushing hard enough on something new.

2407
02:29:01,110 --> 02:29:04,410
And my advice would be look at
rejection in a different way.

2408
02:29:05,010 --> 02:29:06,240
That equation for me was,

2409
02:29:06,250 --> 02:29:11,040
was just a way to reframe rejection as
an opportunity to keep going, move on.

2410
02:29:11,790 --> 02:29:15,990
And so my advice for everybody
watching right now is that, you know,

2411
02:29:16,010 --> 02:29:17,890
the gift of an entrepreneur's
reframe things.

2412
02:29:17,891 --> 02:29:20,850
And anytime there's a rejection that
you face, turn it into an invitation,

2413
02:29:21,700 --> 02:29:25,680
turn it into an invitation to keep
going and you can say yes or no.

2414
02:29:25,710 --> 02:29:29,170
You don't have to be at least
create this opportunity to,

2415
02:29:30,110 --> 02:29:33,720
to persevere, to get, to continue
going forward. And for me, every,

2416
02:29:33,721 --> 02:29:37,680
all the stories I've shared so far
from the senior prank that the intercom

2417
02:29:37,681 --> 02:29:42,681
system through decrypt buns through to
the beginnings of Airbnb are reframing

2418
02:29:44,731 --> 02:29:48,060
every know into a cool,
that person didn't like it.

2419
02:29:48,061 --> 02:29:49,710
I'm going to keep going until
I find somebody that does.

2420
02:29:50,560 --> 02:29:55,560
And also something at least that I see
from the outside looking in when you're

2421
02:29:56,020 --> 02:30:01,020
sharing all of these stories
and experiences is that
you are also over time by

2422
02:30:01,271 --> 02:30:03,970
exposing yourself to
rejection and reframing,

2423
02:30:04,270 --> 02:30:09,270
learning to in some way seek
out discomfort as opposed
to avoid discomfort and

2424
02:30:11,830 --> 02:30:15,370
that that's one thing
that also comes up for me.

2425
02:30:16,450 --> 02:30:20,910
And on top of that,
the fact that and why I,

2426
02:30:21,440 --> 02:30:26,440
I'm so excited that we were able to get
together to talk about some of these

2427
02:30:27,130 --> 02:30:28,810
many of these stories just of course,
just a,

2428
02:30:28,860 --> 02:30:33,860
a portion of your many life experiences
is that people are already familiar at

2429
02:30:34,961 --> 02:30:38,920
this point with Arab air BNB and all caps,
right.

2430
02:30:40,210 --> 02:30:43,570
Magazine covers,
uh,

2431
02:30:43,630 --> 02:30:47,770
one of the most successful
startups in the world, uh,

2432
02:30:47,920 --> 02:30:50,770
one of the fastest growing startups of
all time, et Cetera, et Cetera, et cetera.

2433
02:30:51,310 --> 02:30:52,750
And I think it's,

2434
02:30:52,780 --> 02:30:57,780
it's easy because as humans we want to
take shortcuts and create stories that

2435
02:30:59,141 --> 02:31:03,580
are easily graspable to think of
that as idea, execute success.

2436
02:31:04,020 --> 02:31:07,810
I didn't like it. It just came out of
the balloon was this overnight success.

2437
02:31:08,320 --> 02:31:13,320
But there's so much contributing to that
and so many diverse experiences that

2438
02:31:14,350 --> 02:31:19,060
yes, you had, but in some ways
you also help to engineer. And,

2439
02:31:19,130 --> 02:31:19,963
uh,

2440
02:31:20,700 --> 02:31:24,270
I think that's inspiring
to know that it wasn't,

2441
02:31:25,080 --> 02:31:30,080
it wasn't the byproduct of this immaculate
master plan that required you to be

2442
02:31:30,211 --> 02:31:31,530
Elan Musk times 10,

2443
02:31:31,860 --> 02:31:34,290
that you executed over two week period
and then you have an empire. No,

2444
02:31:34,291 --> 02:31:36,660
that's not,
that's not how it unfolds it all

2445
02:31:36,720 --> 02:31:41,720
a people think we woke up in Airbnb
was just created out of thin air that

2446
02:31:42,210 --> 02:31:44,190
couldn't be further from the truth.
And I hope if any,

2447
02:31:44,191 --> 02:31:47,670
there's any takeaway from the stories
that we've talked about today is that

2448
02:31:48,720 --> 02:31:51,990
there's just a long lineage of
trying things, bumping into walls,

2449
02:31:51,991 --> 02:31:55,530
getting rejected, like failing, reframing,

2450
02:31:55,650 --> 02:31:58,620
failure until learning and
trying to continue forward.

2451
02:31:58,650 --> 02:32:01,530
And so by the time airbnb came around,

2452
02:32:02,040 --> 02:32:05,190
it was like I'd been in the gym of
entrepreneurship for many years.

2453
02:32:05,820 --> 02:32:10,590
So it's like you don't wake up and just
run a marathon all of a sudden that no

2454
02:32:10,620 --> 02:32:14,790
does that. You train for it. And so
by the time it's ready for race day,

2455
02:32:15,630 --> 02:32:18,720
your body's conditioned for it and your
muscles and your system, your nervous,

2456
02:32:18,750 --> 02:32:21,990
like everything's ready for
you to go run 26 plus miles.

2457
02:32:22,840 --> 02:32:25,740
And I think entrepreneurs that
entrepreneurship is the exact same way.

2458
02:32:26,130 --> 02:32:28,680
And I think it's a misconception when
people look at the magazine covers and

2459
02:32:28,681 --> 02:32:31,770
they read the stories of a
successful company, they think, wow,

2460
02:32:31,771 --> 02:32:34,320
like the people that started that,
it just,

2461
02:32:34,530 --> 02:32:38,040
they built it and everybody came that
couldn't be further from the truth.

2462
02:32:38,490 --> 02:32:41,540
And like I think feel the dreams is
probably the worst movie ever happened.

2463
02:32:41,560 --> 02:32:44,970
Entrepreneurship because it created
this idea like, oh wow, if you build it,

2464
02:32:44,971 --> 02:32:49,410
they will come. I can tell you if you
build it, they don't come. Um, and it, it,

2465
02:32:49,590 --> 02:32:53,940
it takes us incredible perseverance and
sometimes irrational belief in yourself

2466
02:32:54,660 --> 02:32:57,120
to bring something to life in
the face of a lot of diversity.

2467
02:32:57,121 --> 02:33:00,480
And a lot of people saying
it can't happen. Um,

2468
02:33:00,660 --> 02:33:05,130
and so I hope if there's any takeaway
from the stories that I shared today,

2469
02:33:05,131 --> 02:33:08,880
it's that the simple act
of spotting an opportunity,

2470
02:33:09,450 --> 02:33:12,930
coming up with the original solution and
then taking that third but hardest step

2471
02:33:13,590 --> 02:33:17,310
of putting something into the world of
trying something to putting your idea

2472
02:33:17,311 --> 02:33:21,240
into practice.
It doesn't have to be the big idea.

2473
02:33:21,600 --> 02:33:26,310
It's just about being in the gym and
doing a Rep, the gym of entrepreneurship,

2474
02:33:26,460 --> 02:33:31,320
you're doing like a curls or something
like it's just getting in the habit of

2475
02:33:31,350 --> 02:33:33,030
those three things.
You spot an opportunity,

2476
02:33:33,031 --> 02:33:35,850
you come up with a regional solution
and you put your idea into the world and

2477
02:33:35,851 --> 02:33:40,020
the more you can do that, the better you
are at spotting the next opportunity.

2478
02:33:40,530 --> 02:33:45,530
And airbnb just happened to be a part of
the lineage of all the things I've told

2479
02:33:45,811 --> 02:33:46,650
you that happened before it.

2480
02:33:48,420 --> 02:33:53,420
So can you lay out the equation one more
time and what each letter stands for?

2481
02:33:55,480 --> 02:33:56,313
Absolutely.

2482
02:33:57,000 --> 02:34:01,320
Sw squared plus WC equals emo.

2483
02:34:02,220 --> 02:34:05,430
And what the stands for is that when
you introduce a new idea to the world,

2484
02:34:05,880 --> 02:34:06,930
some will love it.

2485
02:34:07,650 --> 02:34:12,650
Some Malt plus who cares equals move on.

2486
02:34:14,820 --> 02:34:17,860
Keep going until you find the
people that do love your idea.

2487
02:34:20,380 --> 02:34:22,620
All Right, Gel. Amazing.

2488
02:34:23,550 --> 02:34:26,940
Where can people say hi to you online,
find you,

2489
02:34:27,060 --> 02:34:30,600
where can they learn more about the
company and anything else that you might

2490
02:34:30,601 --> 02:34:31,434
want to mention?

2491
02:34:32,720 --> 02:34:36,980
I'd say go to airbnb.com and
if you want to connect with me,
