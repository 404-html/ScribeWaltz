1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,750
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02,751 --> 00:00:05,960
I can run flat out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:07,950
No one else would pose a question.

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,570
I'm a cybernetic organism living.

5
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,370
This episode is brought to you by Peloton,

6
00:00:26,371 --> 00:00:28,020
which I've been using
probably for about a year now.

7
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:32,280
Peloton is a cutting edge indoor cycling
bike that brings live studio classes

8
00:00:32,281 --> 00:00:35,400
right into your home. You can also
do on demand, which is what I do.

9
00:00:35,401 --> 00:00:39,180
We'll come back to that so you don't have
to worry about fitting classes into a

10
00:00:39,181 --> 00:00:43,140
busy schedule or making it to a studio
or gym with a hectic or unpredictable

11
00:00:43,141 --> 00:00:44,760
commute. I, for instance,

12
00:00:44,761 --> 00:00:48,930
have a Peloton bike right in my master
bedroom at home and it's one of the first

13
00:00:48,931 --> 00:00:52,620
things I do. Many mornings I
wake up and meditate for a bit.

14
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,180
Then I knock out a short 20 minute ride
in my undies. Hard to do that at the gym,

15
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,940
take a shower and I'm in higher
gear for the rest of the day.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,120
It's really convenient and has become
something that I look forward to.

17
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,910
So you have a lot of options
for one if you'd like,

18
00:01:05,911 --> 00:01:09,420
you can ride live with thousands of
other writers across the country on an

19
00:01:09,421 --> 00:01:11,490
interactive leaderboard
to keep you motivated.

20
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:16,750
There are also up to 14 new classes added
everyday with more than 8,000 classes

21
00:01:17,011 --> 00:01:21,960
on demand and you can pick
based on length, 45 minutes,
20 minutes, whatever music,

22
00:01:21,961 --> 00:01:26,250
hip hop, rock and roll or say low impact
versus high intensity or interval.

23
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:31,440
You can pick the class structure and
style that works for you and in my case I

24
00:01:31,441 --> 00:01:35,730
quite like Matt Wilbur's and I tend to
do on demand and listened to a lot of and

25
00:01:35,731 --> 00:01:37,890
watch many of the same
classes over and over,

26
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,770
but I'm kind of promiscuous and also
enjoy classes from a lot of the other

27
00:01:40,771 --> 00:01:41,604
instructors.

28
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:45,930
They have Peloton and amazing roster of
incredible instructors in New York City

29
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:49,260
with a whole range of styles
and personalities so you
can find what you're in

30
00:01:49,261 --> 00:01:50,094
the mood for.

31
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:54,090
You also get real time metrics that you
can use to track your performance over

32
00:01:54,091 --> 00:01:58,950
time and that will help, I would say
catalyze you to beat your personal best.

33
00:01:58,951 --> 00:02:01,980
Now that all sounds good, right?
Gamification, Yada, Yada, Yada.

34
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:06,240
I didn't think that it would work
for me or in any way incentivize me,

35
00:02:06,241 --> 00:02:09,780
but they really 100% hit the
nail on the head. I was very,

36
00:02:09,781 --> 00:02:12,900
very impressed with how motivating it was.

37
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,620
I know worked tremendously
to keep me pushing a,

38
00:02:16,621 --> 00:02:19,770
which quite honestly takes a fair amount.
I can get quite lazy,

39
00:02:19,771 --> 00:02:22,350
particularly with anything
that edges on endurance,

40
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:26,640
which is kind of more than five reps
of anything for me. So check it out.

wordpress.com I love wordpress.

50
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,920

51
00:03:08,921 --> 00:03:11,770
It's my goto platform for
blogging and creating websites.

52
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,790
I use wordpress.com for
everything every day. My site,

53
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:20,710
tim.blog is built on it. The websites
for my books, including tools of titans,

54
00:03:20,711 --> 00:03:25,600
tribe of mentors. It's all
in wordpress.com and the
founder Matt Mullenweg.

55
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,780
One of my close friends has
appeared on the show many times.

56
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:33,010
Just search Matt Mullenweg,
Tequila Ferris for quite an exciting time.

57
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:37,450

by the New Yorker, Jay Z,

60
00:03:45,881 --> 00:03:48,970
Beyonce, five 38 tech crunch, Ted, CNN,

61
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,430
and time just to name a handful,

62
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:56,850
and one

friends@googlewhoshallremainnamelesshastoldmethatwordpress.com

63
00:03:58,181 --> 00:04:02,200
offers the best out of the
box SEO imaginable end quote,

64
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:07,010
and it's one of the many reasons that
nearly 30% of the Internet is run on

65
00:04:07,011 --> 00:04:07,844
wordpress.

66
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:11,660
You do not need experience or to hire
someone that's perhaps the best part.

67

designs and templates that
you can use and it's easy to

69

get started. There's no need to
worry about security upgrades,

70
00:04:22,481 --> 00:04:26,870
hosting any of that. They for 24
seven support and they're very,

71
00:04:26,871 --> 00:04:29,300
very responsive. If you have

headache and friction. So if

Hello boys and girls.

83
00:05:08,831 --> 00:05:12,010
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to
another episode of the Tim Ferriss show.

84
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,050
This episode is not going to be a long
form interview where I distill and

85
00:05:17,051 --> 00:05:20,650
deconstruct world class performers.
In fact,

86
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,640
it is going to be nothing of the sort.
It is a Q and a episode.

87
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:29,170
This is tea time with Tim or
Timmy or Timbo if your prefer,

88
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:34,500
where I solicited phone numbers from all
of you and called a handful of you to

89
00:05:36,971 --> 00:05:40,750
field any questions that you might
have and I've done these before.

90
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,790
They're always a lot of fun for me to do.

91
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:48,150
And among other topics covered in the
various phone calls that you will hear in

92
00:05:48,701 --> 00:05:53,020
this episode, how to find mentors.
How do I think about finding mentors?

93
00:05:53,021 --> 00:05:54,670
How have I found mentors in the past?

94
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:58,160
Discussions of meaning
Viktor Frankl and so on.

95
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:02,690
How to get rid of anxiety
or train into confidence.

96
00:06:02,691 --> 00:06:07,600
We talk about that as it relates
to a handful of things. Uh,

97
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:12,290
cocktails, relationship advice.
If we go all over the place.

98
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:17,740
And I hope you enjoy this as
much as I enjoyed recording it.

99
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:23,300
So without further ado,
here is tea time with Tim.

100
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,073
Hello,

101
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,300
is this Edwin?

102
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:29,723
Yes it is.

103
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:32,790
Edwin, this is Tim Ferriss
calling. Good afternoon.

104
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:36,810
Hey Tim, how you doing? Oh man, I
can't, I can't believe this is real.

105
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:40,900
It's real.
I'm afraid I have,

106
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:45,430
I have called up and I made my
daycare. Well, me too. Me Too.

107
00:06:45,431 --> 00:06:48,970
So let's jump right into it.
How can I help any a, and I
can't promise I can help,

108
00:06:48,971 --> 00:06:51,370
but I'll try to answer whatever
questions you might have.

109
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:55,570
I appreciate that.
So my question is about mentors.

110
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:59,920
So what guidance do you have for
finding a mentor to kind of help,

111
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,590
maybe gain a better understanding
about an industry? Um,

112
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,620
and I think more importantly,

113
00:07:05,621 --> 00:07:09,730
how would you or what guidance do you
have for asking someone to be a mentor?

114
00:07:09,731 --> 00:07:10,630
How do you approach them?

115
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:14,440
How do you kind of break that
or make that initial contact?

116
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:18,350
I can, I can actually
answer this one. So the,

117
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:23,650
the first rule of thumb is that I
would highly advise against ever asking

118
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:28,811
someone directly to be a mentor in
using those words because the people you

119
00:07:29,961 --> 00:07:33,140
generally will want as a mentor,
unless they're retired,

120
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:38,980
are probably quite busy and we'll hear
mentor is unpaid part time or full time

121
00:07:40,521 --> 00:07:44,780
job before ever and therefore you want
to approach it somewhat indirectly.

122
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,460
And there are a few
different ways to do that.

123
00:07:46,461 --> 00:07:49,010
There's also a resource I can recommend,

124
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:52,760
which is a book called the third door,

125
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:57,970
which I think does a very good job of
exploring real life case studies of

126
00:07:59,511 --> 00:08:03,710
communication that works in communication
that doesn't work when you're reaching

127
00:08:03,711 --> 00:08:08,711
out to people who are where you'd like
to be or who could be possible mentors

128
00:08:09,501 --> 00:08:11,600
even remotely by what
their rights and so on.

129
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,770
So I would suggest
checking out that point.

130
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:17,060
I'm actually,
I have it in my hand.

131
00:08:17,061 --> 00:08:22,061
I heard your interview with Alex
Benign on your podcast and men,

132
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,091
I have to say,

133
00:08:23,091 --> 00:08:26,030
I am understand it's gotten me through
some hard times and that's where I

134
00:08:26,031 --> 00:08:29,420
initially came across this book and I'm,
I'm right around that chapter.

135
00:08:29,421 --> 00:08:34,130
I'm a maybe like the 60 70 pages in and
I just read the part where it kind of

136
00:08:34,131 --> 00:08:36,260
goes into the intro,
how we've kind of talked to you.

137
00:08:36,261 --> 00:08:38,960
And so I think that's where
that question came from.

138
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:40,030
Perfect.

139
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,680
Great.
Yeah,

140
00:08:41,681 --> 00:08:45,430
so I'm just trying to break into this and
I'm trying to kind of not repeat those

141
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,720
mistakes that he highlights.

142
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,000
So let me,
let me,

143
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,400
let me take a stab at saving
you from some pitfalls.

144
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:54,643
The way,

145
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:59,890
way that I first connected with people
who later became mentors in a sense when

146
00:09:02,671 --> 00:09:06,720
I landed in Silicon Valley in
2000 was through volunteering.

147
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:10,290
So I highly recommend volunteering.

148
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:15,350
And the reason for that is that many
organizations including entrepreneurial or

149
00:09:16,591 --> 00:09:19,770
entrepreneurship focused organizations,
that could be the Eo,

150
00:09:19,771 --> 00:09:24,480
the entrepreneurs' organization, it
could be young presidents, organization,

151
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:29,250
Ypo, it could be any number of others.
There are many of them in Silicon Valley.

152
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:32,910
I've volunteered at PTI,
which is the Indus Entrepreneur,

153
00:09:32,911 --> 00:09:35,730
even though I'm clearly not Indian,
uh,

154
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:39,090
and volunteered at a [inaudible],

155
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,880
which at the time was the
silicon valley associate, uh,

156
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:44,640
association of startup entrepreneurs.

157
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:49,700
And they given their location
and given their focus,

158
00:09:49,951 --> 00:09:53,700
were able to get media to attend,
to cover speakers,

159
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:59,140
meaning to feature speakers in articles
and so on for Forbes or fortune and we'd

160
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:03,360
ever might be.
And that meant if I were to volunteer,

161
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:06,720
even if I were simply taking
tickets or refilling water glasses,

162
00:10:06,721 --> 00:10:07,650
both of which I did,

163
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:13,020
I would have an opportunity if
I overperformed, which is easy,

164
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:17,550
in fact in most volunteer capacities
because the people who show up very often

165
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:20,070
have the attitude,
I'm not getting paid for this.

166
00:10:20,071 --> 00:10:22,470
So I will do the bare
minimum that they ask of me.

167
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:27,360
So if you are proactive and asking for
additional responsibility or is there

168
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:31,410
anything else I can help with, I finished
x, can I help with anything else?

169
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,920
If you are proactive and really
responsible and get things done on time,

170
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:40,890
you'll very often find that they would
be more than happy to give you additional

171
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:41,611
responsibility.

172
00:10:41,611 --> 00:10:46,611
And that is how I ended up ultimately
sitting in on planning meetings and

173
00:10:47,491 --> 00:10:49,970
volunteering to uh,

174
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:53,310
act as a speaker liaison for an event,

175
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:56,310
which allowed me to reach out to
people I wanted to get to know,

176
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,080
like Jack Canfield,

177
00:10:58,081 --> 00:11:01,890
who is the cocreator is the cocreator
of chicken soup for the soul,

178
00:11:01,891 --> 00:11:03,810
which has sold hundreds
of millions of copies.

179
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:08,850
The person who commercialized Creatine,
first creatine monohydrate that is,

180
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,250
uh, the creator of the
pet rock. I had ida,

181
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:17,300
very motley crew of folks that wanted to
assemble and there had to be something

182
00:11:17,731 --> 00:11:18,451
in it for them.

183
00:11:18,451 --> 00:11:23,451
And what was in it for them was
speaking in front of an audience of

184
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,750
entrepreneurs with media in
attendance to cover them.

185
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:33,000
So I was not asking them for any
favors. In fact, I was asking them,

186
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:34,080
uh,

187
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:39,080
if they'd be willing to sort of receive
media coverage in effect and also

188
00:11:39,361 --> 00:11:43,920
interact with other people at
their level. And it was, it was,

189
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:49,440
uh, during that event I want it to do one
thing and it was not asked them if they

190
00:11:49,441 --> 00:11:53,740
could be a mentor.
It was to demonstrate to them I was very,

191
00:11:53,741 --> 00:11:55,090
very good at doing my job.

192
00:11:55,390 --> 00:12:00,130
So I wanted it to be the smoothest
speaking experience they've ever had.

193
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,040
I wanted it to be an event to remember.

194
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:05,440
I wanted to assure that
they had the media contacts.

195
00:12:05,441 --> 00:12:07,570
They want it to have interactions that is,

196
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:12,730
and following that event,
I later,

197
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,310
much later, maybe a month
or two later, you know,

198
00:12:15,311 --> 00:12:17,820
reached out after thanking the speakers,

199
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:22,510
each speaker separately
and as a group to uh,

200
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,800
Say Ping,
I think it was Jack Canfield at the time.

201
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:30,930
And I used an approach that was similar
to what I outlined in the four hour work

202
00:12:30,931 --> 00:12:34,420
week when reaching out to experts
who are above your pay grade.

203
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:38,680
And in effect said, you know, Jack,
I really enjoyed our interactions.

204
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:43,500
I hope we get to meet again.
And if it's okay with you, I'd,

205
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,170
I'd love to, very rarely, but
if the occasion calls for it,

206
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:52,500
send you a question that overlaps
with your deep experience.

207
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:53,500
Uh,

208
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:58,500
if I'm totally stuck after
trying to figure something
out and it was along those

209
00:13:00,491 --> 00:13:04,300
lines and Jack then,
uh,

210
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:07,570
I kept in touch with, now it's important
for me to qualify what that means.

211
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:12,520
Keep in touch with does not mean pastor
does not say it does not mean send him

212
00:13:12,521 --> 00:13:16,090
quarterly updates.
It does not mean clog has inbox.

213
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:20,560
It means that maybe once
every six to 12 months,

214
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:25,390
I would send him a legitimate question
and I would indicate what I'd already

215
00:13:25,391 --> 00:13:28,420
tried to do to answer the question.
This is really important.

216
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,160
So if you reach out to a potential
mentor or someone who has more life

217
00:13:33,161 --> 00:13:38,140
experience and you say, hi,
Tim, I was just wondering,
I'm studying this in school,

218
00:13:38,141 --> 00:13:38,860
what should I do?

219
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:43,860
That's a terrible question because it
doesn't reflect if you've actually tried

220
00:13:44,351 --> 00:13:48,010
to figure it out on your own or if
you're using me for your personal Google.

221
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:52,410
It also does not lend
itself to a specific answer.

222
00:13:52,411 --> 00:13:53,500
So you have to ask yourself,

223
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:58,890
is this a question that this person
could answer in four lines or less?

224
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,880
And if you're,

225
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:04,150
if you look at the question and realize
it's gonna take them a half hour to

226
00:14:04,151 --> 00:14:07,630
answer it because you're asking them
for the meaning of life and to explain

227
00:14:07,631 --> 00:14:09,430
their trajectory and how
they grew their career,

228
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:13,720
then it's a bad question because
you have more time than they do.

229
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:17,580
And you should be aware of that from
the outset. So generally the question,

230
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,350
I guess the question I'd
love to ask you is x,

231
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,580
here are the things I've already tried.
My tentative plan is this.

232
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:28,000
If you have any other thoughts,
I would really appreciate them.

233
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:31,480
And if you're too busy to respond,
I totally understand.

234
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,930
So give them an out so
that they feel comfortable,

235
00:14:34,931 --> 00:14:37,690
not responding and completely unpressured.

236
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:42,340
This is very important and perhaps
counterintuitively that'll get you more

237
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:47,341
answers because what many younger go
getters will do is they'll send an email

238
00:14:49,091 --> 00:14:52,400
and they'll finish it with
looking forward to your reply.

239
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:57,460
Or I have Tuesday at 2:00 PM and
Thursday at 1:00 PM central open,

240
00:14:57,831 --> 00:14:59,000
which one works for you.

241
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,360
And it's so presumptive and aggressive
that the no matter what the content of

242
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:10,250
that email, the person receiving it
will be likely to think to themselves,

243
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,920
well shit,
if I,

244
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:16,670
if I reward this person with
a response to this email,

245
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:20,900
I am encouraging them to send me 20 more
of these emails and I don't want to do

246
00:15:20,901 --> 00:15:25,730
that, so I'm not going to respond.
So that's, that's one, uh,

247
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,870
one approach.

248
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:31,930
And I would also encourage you to look
for a south by southwest talk that I

249
00:15:34,611 --> 00:15:35,444
gave,

250
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:40,540
which funny enough coincides with
south by southwest starting right now,

251
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:44,930
today and tomorrow and uh,
Austin, Texas in early March.

252
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:49,960
But the talk is titled how to build a
world class network in record time or

253
00:15:54,261 --> 00:15:56,870
something equally hyperbolic.
In any case,

254
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:01,910
it is though an accurate reflection of
the talk and you may be able to find it

255
00:16:01,911 --> 00:16:05,780
on the podcast. So there's a chance
that I took the audio and put it on the,

256
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:06,890
on the podcast.
But if you,

257
00:16:06,891 --> 00:16:11,891
if you Google how to build a world class
network in record time and Tim Ferris,

258
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,610
something will pop up,

259
00:16:13,611 --> 00:16:18,611
whether it is a video recording of the
presentation at south by or it is audio

260
00:16:19,281 --> 00:16:22,410
on the podcast itself,
which I do think, uh,

261
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:26,540
I had repurposed the audio for.
So those are my thoughts.

262
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:28,100
If you're reading the third door,

263
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:31,910
I think that will also compliment
a lot of what we're talking about.

264
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:35,990
So I hope that helps.

265
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,750
Does that fill in some gaps
hopefully or give you some direction?

266
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:41,290
Yes, definitely. And, I mean,

267
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,930
I must say it's one thing they're
reading in a book or to hear it on your

268
00:16:43,931 --> 00:16:46,570
podcasts,
but kind of to hear it straight from you,

269
00:16:46,571 --> 00:16:51,010
it just adds a little more weight to it
and it definitely just makes it sound

270
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:53,700
doable. So I really
appreciate it and I, uh,

271
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:57,130
I think you for your time and
I just, uh, you know, your,

272
00:16:57,131 --> 00:16:59,860
your show's definitely has
been a game changer for me,

273
00:16:59,861 --> 00:17:03,160
so thank you for that and keep doing
what you're doing and I really appreciate

274
00:17:03,161 --> 00:17:04,120
it.
So thank you so much.

275
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:08,580
Thanks so much. My pleasure. Of course.
And I should point out one other thing,

276
00:17:08,581 --> 00:17:12,210
which is when I mentioned
Jack Canfield for instance,

277
00:17:12,211 --> 00:17:16,230
I said it once every six to 12 months.
That's a long time.

278
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:20,790
So that as an indicator that
I'm playing the long game,

279
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,540
right? The question you shouldn't be
asking, and I don't think you are,

280
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:27,570
but the question you shouldn't be asking
is how can I find a mentor for the next

281
00:17:27,571 --> 00:17:30,540
12 months?
If you're looking for something like that,

282
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:34,470
it's going to end up being somewhat
transactional and you're going to have to

283
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:39,240
force something within a context of a
group like the entrepreneurs organization

284
00:17:39,241 --> 00:17:42,930
where people are going there explicitly
for that purpose to learn from one

285
00:17:42,931 --> 00:17:46,830
another to teach and so on.
Otherwise,

286
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,620
I would encourage you to
reframe the question your head.

287
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,170
So the question isn't
how do I get a mentor?

288
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:57,170
The question is how can I encourage
people I aspire to be like,

289
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:59,190
who are 10,
20,

290
00:17:59,191 --> 00:18:03,900
30 years ahead of me to respect
me and want me to succeed?

291
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:09,450
That's a better question. How
do I get people say five, 10,

292
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:14,310
20 years ahead of me whose
paths I might want to emulate?

293
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,640
How do I get those people to
respect me and want me to succeed?

294
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,320
And if you do that,

295
00:18:19,321 --> 00:18:24,321
that's a precursor to them helping you
in ways that resemble those of a mentor.

296
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:29,150
But the word mentor is,
uh,

297
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,470
probably a word that will never come up,

298
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:33,960
even though in practice that's
what they will be doing for you.

299
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:35,603
Does that make sense?

300
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:40,750
Yes it does. It's one of those,
the Tim Ferriss hidden gems.

301
00:18:40,751 --> 00:18:44,230
And I think that's the exact
answer I was hoping for.

302
00:18:44,231 --> 00:18:47,750
That's the exact type of
answer I was hoping. Yeah,

303
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,050
I think you answered it perfectly.

304
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,620
Handwritten Followup notes,

305
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:02,710
handwritten thank you notes or even
just, you know, asking these questions,

306
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:05,230
you know,
a handwritten letter or what have you.

307
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:07,720
Do you have any thoughts on if
one is better than the other?

308
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,460
I don't think a handwritten
letter is necessary.

309
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:14,450
And a lot of people,
myself included,

310
00:19:14,451 --> 00:19:18,860
do not want to give out their mailing
addresses, even if it's a Po box.

311
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:23,210
So I would say it's unnecessary.

312
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:28,240
Giving someone a handwritten note at
an event is a different story and I do

313
00:19:28,431 --> 00:19:29,780
recommend that,
uh,

314
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:34,990
but you can listen to the talk that I
gave on that topic at south by southwest

315
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,410
and on the podcast,

316
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:43,280
which I mentioned earlier and that we'll
get into details on that. All right,

317
00:19:43,281 --> 00:19:47,480
my man, uh, I will leave you to it.

318
00:19:47,481 --> 00:19:49,760
Good luck and a nice chatting with you.

319
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:52,350
Thank you. You too. Have a great day.

320
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:53,323
All right. Bye. Bye.

321
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:59,920
Steve, this is Tim Ferriss
calling. Good afternoon.

322
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:01,283
Oh my gosh,

323
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:05,040
I'm doing great.
I am doing fantastic.

324
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:10,370
It's a beautiful day and I am excited
to attempt to answer any question you

325
00:20:12,721 --> 00:20:17,700
might have. So I am happy to
let you take it from here.

326
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:23,000
Well there's
two different questions.

327
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:34,910
I would say pick if if you could
only get one of them answered,

328
00:20:34,911 --> 00:20:39,110
pick that one because that may be the
case because I want to make sure that I am

329
00:20:39,111 --> 00:20:43,850
able to call more than a few people.
So I would say pick,

330
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:48,790
pick the one you would most like to
answered if you had to choose one.

331
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:52,120
And then if it goes quickly then we
can consider a second one. But we'll,

332
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:52,983
we'll try one.

333
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,610
Okay, great. Well I've read

334
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:05,520
that it was just a great book and it
really made a big impact on me and it made

335
00:21:05,521 --> 00:21:09,240
me think a lot about purpose
and finding meaning in life.

336
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,200
And I guess my question for you is you've,

337
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:18,150
you've reached such a high
level of success being able
to affect so many people.

338
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:23,130
And so I guess my question for you is,
once you've reached that level,

339
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:28,000
how do you continue to find
purpose in your life? Um,

340
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:33,600
has it evolved? You know, what, what
would you say purposes right now?

341
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,420
This is a good question.
Big Question as well.

342
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:41,810
I would say that I'll try to tackle
that in a somewhat meandering fashion.

343
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:43,710
Uh,
the,

344
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:49,670
the first thing I would say is
my approach to book writing,

345
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:53,430
my approach to the podcast,

346
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:58,460
my approach to the television shows
had been involved with has had a common

347
00:22:00,721 --> 00:22:03,060
thread that is very,
very simple.

348
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:08,450
People might even consider it simplistic
and that is if I have a pain or a

349
00:22:09,811 --> 00:22:13,980
problem or if I have a desire or goal,

350
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:19,460
I assume it is very likely that many
other people have the same pains or

351
00:22:19,501 --> 00:22:21,570
problems or desires or goals.

352
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:27,530
So most of what I do is scratching my
own itch with the expectation that if I

353
00:22:29,551 --> 00:22:31,410
can figure out how to,

354
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:37,700
how to navigate any of those things well
and take good notes and test a lot so

355
00:22:39,271 --> 00:22:44,271
that I can try the hundred things to
filter down to the one or two that truly

356
00:22:45,841 --> 00:22:49,530
have a disproportionate,
disproportionately good outcome,

357
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:53,590
that that is a straight forward way of,

358
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:58,640
of adding value to the world and not just
consuming oxygen and eating resources.

359
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:02,910
So that's,
that is my general process,

360
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,470
which is a way of backing into your
question about, you know, what,

361
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:08,940
what is giving me meaning right now?

362
00:23:08,941 --> 00:23:13,941
What is giving me meaning right now
is looking at some of the traumatic

363
00:23:15,031 --> 00:23:16,890
experiences I had as a child.

364
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:21,920
Looking at the repercussions of that and
the behaviors or thought patterns that

365
00:23:22,771 --> 00:23:27,771
are impossible to explain that
I still have in some cases,

366
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:29,550
uh,

367
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:34,550
without looking in the rear view mirror
and somehow metabolizing or integrating

368
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:39,090
what happened to me that
never had a sense of closure.

369
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:44,630
And that then ties into a lot of the
research I'm supporting related to

370
00:23:47,271 --> 00:23:49,200
treatment resistant depression,
uh,

371
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:53,060
related to longterm
demoralization and say, uh,

372
00:23:53,061 --> 00:23:56,710
AIDS survivors at UCF.

373
00:23:57,230 --> 00:24:02,230
And a lot of what I'm hoping to do with
universities and other groups including

374
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:08,000
a Johns Hopkins at the top
of the list. Uh, and uh,

375
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:10,730
for me then it's,
it's,

376
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:16,720
it's assuming that right now for me that
everyone is fighting battles we know

377
00:24:17,151 --> 00:24:19,880
nothing about.
Like literally everyone,

378
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:22,940
there is some degree of suffering,

379
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,820
whether it's minor or major,

380
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:30,280
chronic or acute that
everyone walking around Uc,

381
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,780
I mean I'm looking out a,
a,

382
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:37,640
a high rise right now down at the ground.
So I see these hundreds of ants,

383
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:40,670
which will soon be thousands and tens
of thousands with south by southwest.

384
00:24:40,671 --> 00:24:45,671
And assuming that every one of those
people has some type of suffering past or

385
00:24:46,191 --> 00:24:50,330
present tense that is affecting how
they make decisions, how they interact,

386
00:24:50,331 --> 00:24:51,320
how they view themselves.

387
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:56,710
And if I can provide any tools whatsoever
to decrease that suffering and to

388
00:24:58,761 --> 00:25:01,220
allow them to help other
people who are suffering,

389
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:04,670
then I view that as time very,
very well spent.

390
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:07,670
So that's how I'm thinking
about it right now,

391
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:13,150
but I'm not wedded to that
and I think it can fluctuate.

392
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:14,360
Um,

393
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:19,140
I do think the filling the void
chapter in the four hour workweek,

394
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:23,730
which is probably the most neglected yet
most important chapter in some respects

395
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:26,990
and the entire book towards the tail end,
uh,

396
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:32,050
ties into a lot of the observations that
you would read in Victor Frankel's book

397
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,700
and books for that matter.

398
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:43,390
And so there are certainly complimentary
chapters and books that you could

399
00:25:43,581 --> 00:25:46,720
digest, but when in doubt, uh,

400
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:50,450
I would say instead of
trying to save the world,

401
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:55,480
look at how you can save yourself
or help yourself in some fashion.

402
00:25:56,030 --> 00:26:01,030
And by doing something that seems
very selfish on the surface,

403
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:07,090
you're actually being very
practical because you are
scratching your own itch in

404
00:26:07,731 --> 00:26:10,790
such a fashion that you're
not purely speculating,

405
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:13,760
you are dealing with the real world.
Even if it is limited to you,

406
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:18,380
which I can pretty much guarantee
you if it's any type of suffering,

407
00:26:18,381 --> 00:26:22,340
if it's any type of desire, there's
a very, very high likelihood,

408
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:23,750
probably 100%,

409
00:26:23,751 --> 00:26:28,070
but let's just call it very high
likelihood that there are thousands at a

410
00:26:28,071 --> 00:26:33,071
minimum and probably millions of people
in the world with some close cousin,

411
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,540
uh,
of that,

412
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:40,670
if not the exact same thing in
their deli experience. So that's,

413
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:44,140
that's how I currently am
and thinking about it. Um,

414
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:46,500
but I should also say that there's no,

415
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:49,530
there's no one right answer here.

416
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:54,720
And it said that your meaning could be
playing music and brightening people's

417
00:26:55,201 --> 00:27:00,201
days for 60 minutes or 30 minutes when
you get on stage to play your set because

418
00:27:01,531 --> 00:27:06,531
you've carefully crafted this art to
change the emotional state of people who

419
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:14,070
are sitting within 50 feet of you.
That and if that gave you meaning. Uh,

420
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:18,750
and certainly I think that's,
uh, I think that is meaningful.

421
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:23,270
I think that's very meaningful. Uh,
even though other people who, uh,

422
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:25,470
might sit on the sidelines and judge,

423
00:27:25,471 --> 00:27:27,240
which is usually the people
who judged by the way,

424
00:27:27,241 --> 00:27:30,900
it's not the people in the arena who
are actually scraping their knees and

425
00:27:30,901 --> 00:27:31,651
getting things done,

426
00:27:31,651 --> 00:27:36,030
but the peanut gallery on the Internet
and on the side criticizing you saying

427
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:38,700
that you should be spending your time
a different way if there is no should.

428
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:43,820
This is that we're not dealing
with the natural laws or physical,

429
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,193
uh,

430
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:50,180
hard scientific laws that are sort of in,

431
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:53,160
I mean, we can get into a
conversation of objectivity,

432
00:27:53,161 --> 00:27:56,970
but let's just call them
objective truths, uh, for,

433
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,160
for the sake of this thought exercise,

434
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:04,490
we're dealing with your perception of
what matters and your perception of what

435
00:28:04,921 --> 00:28:07,280
matters. I think, uh,

436
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:10,650
though you should listen to other
people and I encourage you to,

437
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:14,100
to talk to other people about
how they think about it.

438
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:17,520
Your perception of what matters is
your perception of what matters.

439
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:21,220
And you can own that and you
can consider it a valid. Uh,

440
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:26,740
I would say that it's helpful as
your walking around in the world is a

441
00:28:28,171 --> 00:28:33,171
proceeding machine to perhaps read or
listen to certain books like awareness by

442
00:28:35,821 --> 00:28:38,200
Anthony Demello would be,
uh,

443
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:42,420
a a one recommendation that I would have.
Uh,

444
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,680
but I'll stop talking in a second
because this is a long answer,

445
00:28:46,681 --> 00:28:49,950
but I can't give the meaning of life.

446
00:28:49,951 --> 00:28:54,951
But I can tell you where I think my
most leveraged point of focus is for

447
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:02,580
creating meaning as I feel it today.

448
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:06,870
And it's not a purely cognitive
exercise I should say.

449
00:29:06,871 --> 00:29:11,700
It's not that I think about it
and sit down with a spreadsheet,

450
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:15,330
although with some of the investments
and donations I make in science,

451
00:29:15,331 --> 00:29:17,700
I do think about,
uh,

452
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:22,470
the downstream effects of
certain landmark studies,

453
00:29:22,471 --> 00:29:26,990
for instance. So I do use an
analytical side to it, but the,

454
00:29:26,991 --> 00:29:31,530
the analytical is more,
in my case these days for the execution.

455
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,670
So I really try to feel with what,

456
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:39,680
what do I get a whole body yes to that
makes me and other people feel better or

457
00:29:41,291 --> 00:29:42,070
that uh,

458
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:47,070
in some fashion solves a problem or
helps me or others to get what they're

459
00:29:47,681 --> 00:29:52,681
hoping to have or it gives people hope
then enables them in some fashion.

460
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,260
You know, what, what is the
feeling that I want? Right?

461
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:57,850
So instead of saying
how do I find meaning,

462
00:29:57,851 --> 00:30:02,851
say like what is the feeling I hope to
have when I find meaning when a sort of

463
00:30:03,131 --> 00:30:04,840
an antecedent or,
uh,

464
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:08,530
if you can kind of diagnose
what you need by looking at the,

465
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:10,840
the symptoms,
the side effects,

466
00:30:10,841 --> 00:30:14,500
which would be how you would feel like
if you were doing something really

467
00:30:14,501 --> 00:30:16,870
meaningful, what would that give
you that you don't currently have?

468
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:22,410
And then try to map that as you're
talking about different ideas,

469
00:30:22,871 --> 00:30:24,940
different topics,
different ways you could spend your time.

470
00:30:24,941 --> 00:30:27,040
Like when does that feeling come up?

471
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:32,880
And then if you use that as
as one criteria for deciding
where you might want to

472
00:30:34,511 --> 00:30:37,390
focus to create meaning a,

473
00:30:37,391 --> 00:30:42,391
then you can use the analytical to build
a plan for executing on everything we

474
00:30:43,811 --> 00:30:44,560
just described.

475
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:49,240
But that's long answer
to a short question.

476
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:52,830
Hopefully that wasn't
completely a word salad. Uh,

477
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:55,120
did any of that make any sense whatsoever?

478
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,780
That was incredible.
Thank you so much.

479
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:03,870
That's extremely helpful
and in my situation, um,

480
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:09,180
I just really appreciate you taking
the time to answer my question and it's

481
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:14,460
super helpful and I just feel like I
need to say thank you for everything that

482
00:31:14,861 --> 00:31:18,880
you, that you do and that you've done.
Um, I know you hear this all the time,

483
00:31:18,881 --> 00:31:23,650
but you know, I've been following your
work for a very, very long time and uh,

484
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,820
you know,
it's,

485
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:29,530
you've made so many impacts on my own
life and I know you've made impacts on so

486
00:31:29,531 --> 00:31:33,640
many people. So I just want to say
thank you for being you and I really,

487
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:34,510
really appreciate you.

488
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:39,690
Thank you Steve.
I appreciate you as well.

489
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:40,260
Honestly,

490
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:45,260
it's like I wouldn't be here able to
do this if I didn't have listeners and

491
00:31:45,931 --> 00:31:50,931
readers who've been so incredibly
supportive of this accidental career I've

492
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,433
ended up having.

493
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:58,100
So it's a real blessing to be able to do
this in any way and it means a lot that

494
00:32:01,471 --> 00:32:03,930
you would even fill out the
form to allow me to call.

495
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:07,200
So it's of course my pleasure in
it and I should emphasize too,

496
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:08,760
I'm still figuring this out.

497
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:13,910
I'm still making it up as I go along and
testing and at the end of the day for

498
00:32:15,751 --> 00:32:16,500
me,

499
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:20,760
whether it's looking for meaning
or trying to create meaning,

500
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,030
which I think are two different
approaches that can be very complimentary.

501
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:29,060
Trying to figure out early stage
investing or any number of dozens of other

502
00:32:30,151 --> 00:32:35,151
things I might get my hands into a rather
than trying to debate in your own head

503
00:32:37,111 --> 00:32:40,130
or with other people what
the best approach might be,

504
00:32:40,131 --> 00:32:45,131
what the best next step might be out of
say three or four or even more things.

505
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,330
I just try to test them.

506
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:52,450
So I look for low cost tests with limited
downside that I can throw out into the

507
00:32:55,161 --> 00:32:58,400
world to see what happens,
to see what sticks and what doesn't.

508
00:32:58,430 --> 00:33:03,430
So that's all I'm doing and I'm certainly
learning from lots and lots of people

509
00:33:04,461 --> 00:33:08,840
around me, including people like
yourself. Uh, so I'll let you,

510
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:12,020
I'll let you get back to your day,

511
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:16,130
but thanks very much for
taking the time yourself.

512
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:18,450
Thank you so much Jim.
I really appreciate it.

513
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,560
All right man. Take it easy. Bye.

514
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:24,740
Hello,
I speaking.

515
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,570
Hello, Heather speaking. This is
Tim Ferriss speaking. Good day.

516
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:34,290
No, it's not. It is. I'm
afraid so. Well, hello.

517
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:39,230
Why hello, how's, how's, how's the
other, the, the weather, I said Heather,

518
00:33:39,231 --> 00:33:42,260
how's the Heather I guess was
we could speak that way as well.

519
00:33:42,261 --> 00:33:45,140
How has the Heather and how is the
weather surrounding Heather at the moment?

520
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:50,030
That's how kids get to learn my name and
indeed,

521
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,370
whether it's very cold.

522
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,051
I was going to say,

523
00:33:53,051 --> 00:33:57,390
it looked like you were calling or I
should say I was calling a Toronto number.

524
00:33:57,391 --> 00:33:58,260
Find City.

525
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:02,700
It is some fantastic friends
and fantastic startups also.

526
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:05,040
And that lovely city of yours
that does get a little chilly.

527
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:09,870
What might I be able to attempt
to answer for you, Heather?

528
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:15,200
So I don't have a pillar and I am,

529
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:18,350
I have started taking karate.
I've been invited to take my

530
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:22,970
black belt test in the spring.

531
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,193
Congratulations.

532
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,870
Gotcha. Thank you. But I'm so nervous.

533
00:34:26,871 --> 00:34:31,640
Just like I live now and
I'm a bit of a choker. Uh,

534
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:34,920
there's no rush.
I'm not going anywhere.

535
00:34:34,921 --> 00:34:37,290
I'm just sitting here
with TV and a computer.

536
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:41,970
Thank you. Um, so I'm,

537
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:46,850
I know that you do all kinds of fees and
I'm just wondering what your method is

538
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:48,830
for staying focused and calm.

539
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:54,410
So the short answer is that I like to
simulate the test environment as much as

540
00:34:59,161 --> 00:35:03,570
possible beforehand. Uh, that can
include many different factors. So,

541
00:35:03,571 --> 00:35:08,400
for instance, if I'm going to be
speaking on stage somewhere, uh,

542
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,930
whether that's Ted or different venue,
I will go,

543
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:17,790
I will always make sure that I have
a chance, ideally the day before,

544
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:23,270
maybe the day of to go spend time on
the stage and to test all the technical

545
00:35:24,721 --> 00:35:29,040
equipment and to know exactly where I'm
going to have breakfast the next day.

546
00:35:29,041 --> 00:35:32,820
If it's a large conference that I don't
have to worry about there being any

547
00:35:32,821 --> 00:35:35,130
hiccup in the logistics,
right?

548
00:35:35,131 --> 00:35:40,131
So I would map out the day that you
anticipate or versions of the day that you

549
00:35:41,941 --> 00:35:46,941
anticipate on your test day and look at
all of the things that can stress you

550
00:35:47,761 --> 00:35:48,330
out,

551
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:52,290
potentially look at all the things the
night before that could stress you out or

552
00:35:52,291 --> 00:35:56,820
cause issues. And then, uh, do two things.

553
00:35:56,910 --> 00:36:01,910
Number one is try to set up a system so
that you run into the fewest number of

554
00:36:02,401 --> 00:36:05,370
those things as possible.
And then secondly,

555
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:10,730
practice the screw ups beforehand
so that if they do happen,

556
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:15,660
you aren't going to be as
reactive and thrown off,

557
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:18,720
if that makes sense. Right. So,

558
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:24,260
so that could include going to end
using visualization is fine for a lot of

559
00:36:26,701 --> 00:36:30,630
this, but let's just say that there's a
possibility I'm making up this example,

560
00:36:30,631 --> 00:36:30,841
right?

561
00:36:30,841 --> 00:36:35,841
But if there's a possibility that it at
a specific speaking location of do a lot

562
00:36:37,201 --> 00:36:39,300
of speaking anymore,
but let's just say hypothetically,

563
00:36:39,301 --> 00:36:42,780
I'm going to go want to get a
coffee and I think the coffee,

564
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:47,310
the coffee shop might be
completely overrun with people.
And I don't like crowds,

565
00:36:47,311 --> 00:36:48,600
even though I can speak
in front of crowds,

566
00:36:48,601 --> 00:36:52,830
I don't actually like being in
crowds. Uh, so two things. Number one,

567
00:36:52,831 --> 00:36:56,190
I'm going to come up with
contingency plans, right?

568
00:36:56,191 --> 00:37:01,191
So maybe I buy my own coffee machine and
a target that I can replace or returned

569
00:37:02,761 --> 00:37:06,960
two days later. Maybe I get some
instant coffee from Starbucks.

570
00:37:06,961 --> 00:37:11,010
Maybe I decide to use room service,
uh,

571
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,830
and have backup plants that
I don't have to do that.

572
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:19,340
And then I could also go in a
number of times when it's really,

573
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:22,420
really busy and,
uh,

574
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:27,470
visualize that it is the day of my
speaking gig or the black belt test and

575
00:37:29,101 --> 00:37:32,820
practice calming yourself
down. I think part of, uh,

576
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:36,900
part of the mistakes or one
of the mistakes, excuse me,

577
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:42,230
that that folks make is they practice
skills like meditation and mindfulness in

578
00:37:45,151 --> 00:37:48,120
a vacuum, if that, if that makes sense.

579
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:50,610
So that's exactly right.

580
00:37:50,611 --> 00:37:55,380
So they will meditate in the morning when
it's completely quiet before anyone's

581
00:37:55,381 --> 00:37:58,860
gotten up on their special
cushion in their special room.

582
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:03,600
And then they go to the DMV and they
completely lose their shit because they

583
00:38:03,601 --> 00:38:08,601
haven't practiced the skill
in the environment that
most demands it or the type

584
00:38:09,301 --> 00:38:11,880
of environments. Uh, so for instance, uh,

585
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:16,920
a few years ago I went on my first,
uh,

586
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:19,710
well it was not my first Caribou hunt
in this case was an el Concen. I don't,

587
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:23,070
I don't hunt very much,
consume everything that I hunt,

588
00:38:23,071 --> 00:38:28,071
but I do hunt occasionally and I went
an El con did not end up harvesting any

589
00:38:29,101 --> 00:38:32,340
elk. Uh, but in preparation for that,

590
00:38:32,341 --> 00:38:36,950
because it was going to be a
bow hunt, I practicing, uh,

591
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:41,080
in upstate New York, uh, with
archery and I hired a coach.

592
00:38:41,081 --> 00:38:44,270
I was doing all sorts of technical
training, which you've done already.

593
00:38:44,271 --> 00:38:47,860
If you're a black belt test, right?
You've done the technical practice. Yeah,

594
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,600
because doing technical practice,
uh,

595
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:53,770
but then I realized a few things when
I travel. In this case to Colorado,

596
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:58,500
I'm going to be going from sea
level to something like s between,

597
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:02,290
uh, between seven and
11,000 feet of elevation.

598
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,800
So my heart is automatically going to
be beating a lot faster just to make a,

599
00:39:08,501 --> 00:39:13,360
to oxygenate my blood properly or
oxygenating my tissues, I suppose, uh,

600
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:15,310
more effectively.
Second,

601
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:20,490
I am almost certainly going to be
extremely nervous at that point.

602
00:39:20,681 --> 00:39:25,510
Had never even seen a bull
elk and they're gigantic.

603
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:30,540
They're like horse with these enormous
antlers and they make these really

604
00:39:31,481 --> 00:39:33,110
incredible shrieking sound.

605
00:39:33,111 --> 00:39:35,680
Sounds like a woman like being
thrown off a cliff or something.

606
00:39:35,681 --> 00:39:40,180
They make these incredible sounds.
So I assumed if I run into an elk,

607
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:44,180
which is the objective,
and I have, uh, uh,

608
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:49,590
a whatever the draw is on the bow pulled
back and my muscles are super tense and

609
00:39:49,691 --> 00:39:54,370
I've been wondering if I'll
screw it up all day long. Uh,

610
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:59,320
I'm probably going to feel like I've had,
you know, three double espressos. Okay.

611
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:03,520
If, if that's the case,
I should practice, uh,

612
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:08,320
under those physiological conditions.
So what I did is I did a number of things.

613
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:13,690
I would do say 20 or 30 burpees
or 40 or 50 kettlebell swings.

614
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:16,180
And then I would pick up
the bow and take one shot.

615
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:18,670
And I did this when I was
practicing in New York,

616
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:23,260
maybe cause I wanted to get my heart
rate, uh, wellover say like one 80.

617
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:27,310
So I would do whatever necessary
to get very physiologically,

618
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:33,130
uh, what I would consider off baseline
and then to attempt the skill,

619
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:37,450
right? And you want, you
want to be safe with it, of
course. But I would mimic that.

620
00:40:37,451 --> 00:40:41,380
And I also did that when I was
preparing for my ted talk. I would,

621
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:42,753
uh,

622
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:48,270
I would down a bunch of double espressos
and then go in to give the presentation

623
00:40:48,851 --> 00:40:53,350
because I'm giving a presentation as a
rehearsal in front of a familiar crowd.

624
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:58,440
Ultimately when I'm blinded by the
houselights or the stage lights rather and

625
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:02,080
unable to see people in the crowd,
my body's going to react very differently.

626
00:41:02,081 --> 00:41:06,910
So I want to mimic that. Uh, how far
out is your black belt test right now?

627
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:11,510
They haven't set the date,
but I believe first evaluations in May.

628
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:15,770
Okay. So you have, you have something
like two months. Uh, so, uh,

629
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:17,910
do you do,
uh,

630
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,440
do you do any type of performance
in front of crowds? Do you,

631
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:27,420
have you done any public
speaking or sports competitions,

632
00:41:27,421 --> 00:41:28,890
things of that nature?
In the past,

633
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:34,230
many moons ago I, I
perform in front of, um,

634
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,820
it's been a few decades. So, uh,

635
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,740
they just find that I'm
overwhelmed at the idea. Yup.

636
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:45,510
What does, what does, uh,

637
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:49,650
what is the format of the black belt test?

638
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:52,050
Is it going to be the class watching you?

639
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:56,610
Is it going to be in a familiar location,
a new location? What does it look like?

640
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,160
I,
from what I understand,

641
00:41:59,161 --> 00:42:04,161
there are two main testing locations
and they're sort of more of a formality,

642
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:10,240
uh, gathering, but none of them are
in and location that I typically,

643
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:14,750
that I would get to practice that on the
norm. Like they're not at the Dojo. Um,

644
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:19,800
and I think they're far out and
big. That's fair. Quite a number.

645
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:24,520
What are, what are your concerns?
What are you worried could happen?

646
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:28,690
Uh,
I'm read that I will blank

647
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:31,010
there.

648
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:35,890
There was a time where I was in a
another competition and when it,

649
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:37,210
when it came game day,

650
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:42,780
I just got so nervous I couldn't find
my feet with nothing to do with martial

651
00:42:43,601 --> 00:42:48,250
arts, but still in, so I have that fear
that it's going to happen again and uh,

652
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:49,960
it's ridiculous.

653
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:53,060
No, it's not ridiculous. I don't
think it's ridiculous at all.

654
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:56,070
I really don't think it's your data.
This is,

655
00:42:56,090 --> 00:43:01,090
it's a response that your body and
psyche or having to a past experience to

656
00:43:02,181 --> 00:43:06,230
protect you, right? So you're
sort of subconsciously,

657
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:12,190
you're trying to protect
yourself to prevent what
happened from happening again.

658
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:18,800
That makes perfect sense. So the way
you overcome that is in my experience,

659
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:24,250
not by expecting that on game day you're
going to be able to summon the self

660
00:43:24,321 --> 00:43:29,321
talk that is going to be a hundred times
more effective than any of your self

661
00:43:29,361 --> 00:43:33,260
talk in the past.
It's by rehearsing what you fear.

662
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:35,930
So you have two months,
which is great news.

663
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:39,140
So I would think about other
things that make you nervous,

664
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:42,380
that would make you a specifically
nervous about blanking right?

665
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:45,710
Whether that's getting up on stage
and talking in front of people.

666
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:50,540
If that's an example, then find a
local toastmasters for instance,

667
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:54,650
and get up on stage and start
doing that because you will,

668
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:59,680
you will then be begin to develop more
confidence in your ability to either not

669
00:44:01,461 --> 00:44:04,970
blank or to blank and
recover from blanking.

670
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:06,830
Does that make sense?

671
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:12,610
So I would look for other circumstances
that would provoke the same fear and

672
00:44:13,551 --> 00:44:15,290
practices as much as possible.

673
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:20,560
I would also find out ahead of time
what the locations are and I would spend

674
00:44:21,981 --> 00:44:26,981
time at those locations because the fewer
new variables you can have on the day

675
00:44:26,991 --> 00:44:31,770
of testing, the better off you'll
be. Uh, I would never, for instance,

676
00:44:31,771 --> 00:44:33,930
when I was competing a thousand years ago,

677
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:39,770
I would never ever set foot into a
competitive arena or on a mat or anything

678
00:44:41,761 --> 00:44:42,301
like that.

679
00:44:42,301 --> 00:44:46,140
For the first time when I was about
to compete or do some type of testing,

680
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:50,580
I would always do recon ahead
of time and I would not,

681
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:54,340
I would know where the
bathrooms are. I would know, uh,

682
00:44:54,350 --> 00:44:57,510
where the main entrance is.
I would know,

683
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:00,930
I would have an idea of what the
process is going to be. For instance,

684
00:45:00,931 --> 00:45:05,340
when I did my black belt test at
the Kodokan in Tokyo, in Japan,

685
00:45:05,341 --> 00:45:08,860
when I lived there from
15 to 16, uh, four,

686
00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:11,190
it's when I was in Japan,

687
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:16,850
I was part of the judo club, which is the
judo team. I mean though, they're really,

688
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:18,210
but yeah,

689
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:22,590
it doesn't translate particularly well
in English but judo team and that's where

690
00:45:22,591 --> 00:45:23,460
we did our black belt test.

691
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:28,580
So I did reconn even then to know
exactly what the process would look like,

692
00:45:28,741 --> 00:45:32,030
what the format would look like and uh,

693
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:37,070
to actually attend a few practices in
that facility just so that I would have,

694
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:43,050
uh, a familiarity with say, the
temperature of the mats, right? Which is,

695
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:47,220
which it can vary tremendously in
judo from location to location,

696
00:45:47,221 --> 00:45:48,360
I'm sure for other things as well.

697
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:53,360
But the kind of plastic rubbery to Tommy
mats that they use in judo could be

698
00:45:53,581 --> 00:45:57,030
freezing cold, uh, in
one place and really,

699
00:45:57,031 --> 00:46:01,410
really warm and another which affects
the hardness or the s the relative

700
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:02,880
hardness or softness.
Right?

701
00:46:02,881 --> 00:46:07,380
So all of these things I would want
to be exposed to before it matters,

702
00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:08,900
before it counts.
Uh,

703
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:13,980
there's also a very good
book I can recommend that,

704
00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:16,820
uh, has helped me a lot. I've
read it over and over again.

705
00:46:16,830 --> 00:46:18,570
It has a rather cheesy title,

706
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:23,640
but the content is exceptional and a very,

707
00:46:23,641 --> 00:46:24,391
very practical.

708
00:46:24,391 --> 00:46:29,391
It's by Dale Carnegie and it's called
how to stop worrying and start living.

709
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:36,260
And it may seem like a
dramatic recommendation for
this particular example that

710
00:46:38,461 --> 00:46:42,630
you've brought up,
but the fear of blanking,

711
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:48,120
uh, and how that can be self
reinforcing, if that makes sense. Right?

712
00:46:48,121 --> 00:46:52,640
Like the fear of blanking makes it more
likely that you are going to blank. Uh,

713
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:57,660
so that is a psychological, uh, it's,

714
00:46:57,661 --> 00:47:01,030
it's a question of psychology and mindset,
uh,

715
00:47:01,530 --> 00:47:03,990
as well as skill set.
And this is,

716
00:47:03,991 --> 00:47:07,500
I think the neglected component that
I've been alluding to since I started

717
00:47:07,501 --> 00:47:12,270
rambling in response to this is
that, uh, if someone asks me,

718
00:47:12,271 --> 00:47:15,510
and I do get asked this pretty frequently,
like how do I build my confidence?

719
00:47:15,511 --> 00:47:17,310
Like what should my self talk look like?

720
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:22,500
How can I develop confidence in my answer
is you don't develop it in a vacuum.

721
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:28,010
You develop confidence by systematically
exposing yourself to discomfort and

722
00:47:30,761 --> 00:47:35,440
things that you think are just outside
of your capabilities are just outside of

723
00:47:35,441 --> 00:47:38,110
your comfort zone. And
as you do that, you can,

724
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:43,260
you condition yourself to better tolerate
stress and to take what you previously

725
00:47:43,901 --> 00:47:48,340
would have considered risks even
though now you recognize them as very

726
00:47:48,341 --> 00:47:49,300
achievable,

727
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:53,860
trainable objectives and that's
how you build confidence.

728
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:57,460
You build confidence by doing these
things because at the end of the day,

729
00:47:57,461 --> 00:47:59,530
like your inner critic,

730
00:47:59,531 --> 00:48:04,340
your inner voice is going to know
the truth, right? You can do all,

731
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:08,710
you can listen to all of the
motivational audio that you want,

732
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:09,940
but if you've,

733
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:14,050
if you haven't put in the work and
you haven't set foot in this arena,

734
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:19,410
if you haven't subjected yourself to a
similar situations that would provoke

735
00:48:20,471 --> 00:48:25,330
this fear of blanking you are
going to know on on a deep level.

736
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:29,410
On the flip side, this is the good
news. If you've done those things,

737
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:35,080
you show up and you know you've
done everything you could have done.

738
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:39,700
And the self talk is,
I've done all of the preparation,

739
00:48:39,810 --> 00:48:44,050
like I have prepared more methodically
than anyone else who was taking this test.

740
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:50,580
And therefore all I need to do now
is simply let come out what I've been

741
00:48:51,551 --> 00:48:55,260
technically practicing for x number of
months, x number of years. All right.

742
00:48:55,270 --> 00:48:59,860
Like I have, I have turned over every
stone I could to prepare for this.

743
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:05,400
And that is what makes it far less likely
that you're going to blank or I should

744
00:49:06,131 --> 00:49:09,340
say end gives you the
confidence that if you plank,

745
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:14,400
which has happened to me dozens of
times on stage in front of big audiences

746
00:49:14,831 --> 00:49:17,650
while I'm speaking, like
literally like just poof, gone,

747
00:49:17,651 --> 00:49:19,300
do not know what the hell comes next.

748
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:25,690
And once you've learned kind of how
to tap dance with that, uh, you,

749
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:28,710
you develop confidence,
not just your,

750
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:32,110
in your ability to execute on a plan,
but your ability to improvise.

751
00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:37,750
And, uh, those would
be, those would be some,

752
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:41,470
some of my thoughts. But really it's
remove as many unknowns as possible.

753
00:49:41,471 --> 00:49:45,490
If you have, what if this, what if
that go practice, go practice that.

754
00:49:45,491 --> 00:49:49,000
What if in some capacity,
and you know,

755
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:53,800
maybe that's asking to go to a different
karate school with people you don't

756
00:49:53,801 --> 00:49:57,940
know to participate in
a class or to do a demo.

757
00:49:58,030 --> 00:50:00,670
Like would you mind? And you could
explain to the teacher, like,

758
00:50:00,671 --> 00:50:03,340
I'm not coming in here
with a lot of swagger.

759
00:50:03,341 --> 00:50:05,740
I'm trying to prepare for my black
belt test. I'm really nervous.

760
00:50:05,741 --> 00:50:07,900
I'm going to blank.
I'm working with my teacher.

761
00:50:07,901 --> 00:50:11,020
But one thing that was recommended to me
is getting into unfamiliar environments

762
00:50:11,021 --> 00:50:15,430
because that's what the
testing environment is going
to be to actually perform.

763
00:50:15,431 --> 00:50:18,040
So that I have less fear of
blanking when it matters.

764
00:50:18,790 --> 00:50:20,320
And I'm sure that you could find,

765
00:50:20,321 --> 00:50:24,250
you could even ask your instructor if
there's another instructor he or she can

766
00:50:24,251 --> 00:50:28,310
recommend who would be open
to hosting you in a way.

767
00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:31,760
Right. So there, there are
ways to practice this stuff.

768
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:32,750
That's a great idea.

769
00:50:33,210 --> 00:50:36,690
Yeah. So that's uh, which,
which was taught to me, right?

770
00:50:36,691 --> 00:50:39,540
This is all stuff that I picked up
from other people who are really,

771
00:50:39,541 --> 00:50:43,650
really seasoned competitors in
the, in the, in, in most instances.

772
00:50:44,190 --> 00:50:48,300
Uh, yeah. Yeah. So this is this,

773
00:50:48,301 --> 00:50:52,830
these are just little bits and pieces
that I've picked up over time for, uh,

774
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:57,860
inoculating yourself against
sort of a nebulous fear.

775
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:02,850
Uh, and, uh, there's, there's
another exercise that I would very,

776
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:07,470
very strongly recommend you go through
because you may realize even if I blank

777
00:51:07,471 --> 00:51:09,510
and this doesn't work,
it doesn't happen.

778
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:12,990
I can retest three months
later or six months later,

779
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:14,670
right then.

780
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:18,420
And there is a thought exercise that
you can go through which involves some

781
00:51:18,421 --> 00:51:21,960
writing. So I guess it's more than just
a thought exercise called fear setting,

782
00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:25,500
which if, uh, do you have, if you
haven't seen it or even if you have,

783
00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:30,480
it may be an opportune time to revisit.
This is something I do very regularly,

784
00:51:30,481 --> 00:51:34,360
probably at least once a quarter,
maybe even once a month. Uh,

785
00:51:34,361 --> 00:51:36,750
and you can find that at Tim dot.

786
00:51:36,751 --> 00:51:40,740
Blog forward slash ted since I
also discussed the process in,

787
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,170
in my last year past that time

788
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:45,210
and listen to your podcasts.

789
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:46,720
Right.

790
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,340
Wait where I think it's
comparable to other people.

791
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:50,443
Okay.

792
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:51,910
You mentioned it.
Why don't we try it?

793
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:53,160
Yeah.
So I would,

794
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:58,190
I would go and print out that blog post
and just run through the exercise even

795
00:51:59,761 --> 00:52:02,060
if it's seems,
uh,

796
00:52:02,070 --> 00:52:05,920
in some way academic,
uh,

797
00:52:06,030 --> 00:52:11,030
I think that it will also alleviate a
lot of unnecessary pressure or fear that

798
00:52:12,001 --> 00:52:14,970
you're probably imposing on yourself,
uh,

799
00:52:15,030 --> 00:52:18,300
that may not be extremely
well defined and to that book,

800
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:21,870
how to stop worrying and start living
will also chip away at that with different

801
00:52:21,871 --> 00:52:23,950
tools and recommendations.
Okay.

802
00:52:24,090 --> 00:52:25,110
And that was Dale Carnegie?

803
00:52:25,830 --> 00:52:26,663
That's right.

804
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:31,350
Okay. Okay. Thank you.
Um, when smart question,

805
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:36,940
I hear rigorous more so than our regular
training and I don't know if I should

806
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:44,040
leading up with have more rest
time or more like go at it.

807
00:52:44,290 --> 00:52:47,930
The giver leading up to it
too to practice. What do you,

808
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:52,110
what do you recommend that I just am
not, athletics is not my, my background.

809
00:52:52,530 --> 00:52:56,820
Nobody tell it this early. And, um,
I'm looking to get through right and,

810
00:52:56,950 --> 00:52:59,280
and try to do so as gracefully as I can,

811
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:04,420
but I hear that it's quite a long day.
And by design it's a exciting,

812
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:07,800
yeah, I would, uh,

813
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:13,200
I would rest quite a bit in the
week before the actual test,

814
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:19,830
uh, particularly in the
few days beforehand. Uh,

815
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:22,270
but since you have two months,

816
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:27,360
I would strive to make your
training harder than the test day

817
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:31,613
by design.

818
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:37,100
And if you've gone through things
that are harder than the actual fight,

819
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:43,830
so to speak,
you will come in with a very,

820
00:53:43,831 --> 00:53:48,030
very well earned high level of confidence
that you are physically capable

821
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:52,200
because you've already stressed,
tested those circumstances. So I would,

822
00:53:52,201 --> 00:53:56,850
I would absolutely, you know,
within safe boundaries of course,

823
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:57,720
uh,

824
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:02,720
make your training harder than your
competition slash certification for sure.

825
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:08,070
100%. And, uh, I think of this arc,

826
00:54:08,130 --> 00:54:08,851
you locus,

827
00:54:08,851 --> 00:54:13,170
one of my favorite quotes is we do not
rise to the level of our expectations.

828
00:54:13,171 --> 00:54:14,730
We fall to the level of our training,

829
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:16,030
right?

830
00:54:16,030 --> 00:54:17,830
So hope and,
uh,

831
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:22,300
since I'm a high on tea right
now and want to use quartz,

832
00:54:22,301 --> 00:54:26,470
I'll also say, you know, there's,
there's a longer quote by James Cameron,

833
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:30,950
the director, uh, terminate
her Avatar, et Cetera.

834
00:54:31,410 --> 00:54:35,710
Titanic,
which begins with hope is not a strategy.

835
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:38,530
Hope is not a strategy.
Hope is not a strategy.

836
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:43,650
So conditioned yourself by making
your training at least at a few points

837
00:54:45,821 --> 00:54:46,654
beforehand,

838
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:51,220
physically more demanding than the test
day and figuring out ways to do that.

839
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:54,760
And it doesn't necessarily
have to be karate,

840
00:54:54,790 --> 00:54:59,020
but it should be something
that is physically more
demanding than the test day.

841
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:01,930
I would simulate it as
closely as humanly possible.

842
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:04,713
You're welcome.

843
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:09,870
You should. It's the best. Uh,
best, best of luck with your,

844
00:55:09,930 --> 00:55:13,620
with your black belt test. Very
exciting. Yeah. Congratulations.

845
00:55:15,090 --> 00:55:16,170
You too.
Bye Bye.

846
00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:21,543
Justin,

847
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:26,020
how was it in California or at
least on a California telephone?

848
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:27,160
This is Tim Ferriss.

849
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:29,970
I was expecting your call.

850
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:34,890
Well, here I am not, not, not
to, not to leave you hanging.

851
00:55:35,530 --> 00:55:39,830
I appreciate that.
Los Angeles.

852
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:42,860
How's Austin tech is presumably,

853
00:55:43,890 --> 00:55:44,820
it's fantastic.

854
00:55:44,821 --> 00:55:49,680
It decided to brighten up and offer
the son just as people are arriving for

855
00:55:50,070 --> 00:55:53,880
south by southwest,
which it always does to seduce everyone.

856
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,810
But the weather is actually
generally very nice, but it's,

857
00:55:56,860 --> 00:55:59,520
it's been cold for the last week or so.
Uh,

858
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:03,040
how can I be of assistance?
What to question?

859
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:05,820
Might I be able to answer
or attempt to answer?

860
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:11,110
Well, you know, this is more of a
personal question and I read the

861
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:19,430
interesting questions and
I thought if Kim, Tim,

862
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:22,810
if you had to identify as a type of car,

863
00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:26,580
what would that cost Kelby and
why would you identify as it?

864
00:56:29,430 --> 00:56:32,900
I had to be a cocktail.
You know,

865
00:56:32,901 --> 00:56:37,901
the first thing that came to
mind was an old fashioned,

866
00:56:39,530 --> 00:56:40,250
uh,

867
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:45,250
just because I feel like for me there
should be certain constants in life.

868
00:56:48,921 --> 00:56:51,020
You should have,
for instance,

869
00:56:51,890 --> 00:56:56,890
consistency with values and how you
make decisions with your values as,

870
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:01,400
as an operating system
effectively for the go.

871
00:57:01,401 --> 00:57:06,401
No go decisions do not do spend time
with this person versus avoid this person

872
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:09,150
type of decisions.
Uh,

873
00:57:09,350 --> 00:57:14,350
on the other hand passed the basic
ingredients with say an old fashioned,

874
00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:16,910
you then have as a,
as a bartender,

875
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:22,240
quite a bit of room to improvise and
add your own flair and it can vary

876
00:57:22,911 --> 00:57:25,470
tremendously from, from
place to place. Uh,

877
00:57:25,530 --> 00:57:30,530
so I think that then offers
the flexibility to reinvent
yourself with respect to

878
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:37,850
projects with respect to career,

879
00:57:37,910 --> 00:57:42,910
with respect to how you manifest those
values in priorities that guide you a day

880
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:49,850
to day on a more operational,
uh,

881
00:57:50,210 --> 00:57:51,410
on a more operational level.

882
00:57:51,411 --> 00:57:56,411
So that is the first thing that comes
to mind when you ask about cocktail.

883
00:57:58,210 --> 00:58:02,280
There was like some,
some consistency and a,

884
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:05,690
a bedrock foundation that
you can rely on and expect.

885
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:10,720
And then you have the room to improvise
and be creative and reinvent as needed

886
00:58:13,730 --> 00:58:18,730
with all sorts of other
types of adornments and
highlights subtle or over the

887
00:58:20,931 --> 00:58:22,580
top as you see fit.

888
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:25,930
That was a fantastic answer,
that

889
00:58:29,870 --> 00:58:33,280
glad you liked it. And that was a
pretty quick one. Is there as a,

890
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:36,170
do you have any other questions or would
you like to leave it at the cocktail?

891
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:38,293
Sure

892
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:45,630
we'll be able to get you on a
phone call is I'm 27 years old.

893
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:48,180
I'm a gentleman.
I consider myself a,

894
00:58:49,170 --> 00:58:51,140
I'm constantly trying
to learn and you know,

895
00:58:51,210 --> 00:58:54,810
I'm a huge fan of podcasts and I can
express my gratitude enough for everything

896
00:58:54,811 --> 00:58:59,220
that you do for myself and
everybody else. Um, um,

897
00:58:59,221 --> 00:59:03,300
somebody who generally struggles with
finding my purpose and I don't want to go

898
00:59:03,301 --> 00:59:07,920
square peg round hole as far as trying
to force myself down a walk of life that,

899
00:59:07,921 --> 00:59:10,590
you know,
maybe it didn't exactly fit for me.

900
00:59:10,591 --> 00:59:15,580
Was there a time that you felt that you
were particularly stagnant and maybe you

901
00:59:15,590 --> 00:59:18,840
weren't fitting in where you thought you
should have and it was just something

902
00:59:18,841 --> 00:59:20,220
that maybe helped you get over that?

903
00:59:20,450 --> 00:59:23,750
I've had that at many points in my life.

904
00:59:23,870 --> 00:59:28,870
So the first thing I would say is that
it is a normal experience and in fact at

905
00:59:31,821 --> 00:59:36,110
your exact age, I was
having that feeling, uh,

906
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:38,930
27 I would have been

907
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:43,070
in the process of traveling,

908
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:47,480
trying to figure out what
I was going to do next.

909
00:59:47,810 --> 00:59:52,340
So I would have been bouncing from
place to place, uh, living on the cheap,

910
00:59:52,410 --> 00:59:55,820
whether it was Ireland or Berlin
or any number of other places,

911
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:58,280
wondering what the hell am
I going to do with my life?

912
00:59:58,281 --> 01:00:02,060
So I was at the exact same point
in some respects that you are,

913
01:00:02,061 --> 01:00:03,920
it sounds like from
what you're describing,

914
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:09,620
it's the first thing I would
say is don't panic. Don't,

915
01:00:10,110 --> 01:00:15,050
uh, don't view it as a
personal flaw, a defect. Uh,

916
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:15,913
don't,

917
01:00:16,190 --> 01:00:21,190
don't think that you are somehow uniquely
unfocused and that the universe of 27

918
01:00:25,611 --> 01:00:29,360
year olds outside of yourself has this
figured out because that's generally not

919
01:00:29,361 --> 01:00:31,220
the case. And, uh,

920
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:36,240
I've had that feeling at multiple
points and I expect it to come up and I,

921
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:42,940
I don't dread it because I've learned to
view it as an indicator that something

922
01:00:44,331 --> 01:00:46,340
is not working right.

923
01:00:46,430 --> 01:00:51,430
There is something that I
need or something that I
want or something that I want

924
01:00:52,041 --> 01:00:57,041
to give to others and to the world that
is not being accomplished right now.

925
01:00:57,230 --> 01:01:01,630
So I try to view it as a simple indicator
to zoom out to 30,000 feet. And,

926
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:06,740
and try to reassess where things are in
terms of what you do after reassessing

927
01:01:08,850 --> 01:01:13,550
a, and one way to reassess by the
way is to get a book like the 80,

928
01:01:13,551 --> 01:01:18,140
20 principle, uh, and uh,

929
01:01:18,170 --> 01:01:23,030
the last name, it's Richard Koch.
It may actually be pronounced cock.

930
01:01:23,031 --> 01:01:27,440
I have no idea. K O c h a, I
never know how to pronounce it.

931
01:01:27,441 --> 01:01:31,760
I'm going to go with coke. Uh,
the 80, 20 principle, the 80,

932
01:01:31,761 --> 01:01:34,340
20 way, I think living the 80, 20 way,

933
01:01:34,341 --> 01:01:37,340
there are a number of books that he has
written which focus exclusively in the

934
01:01:37,341 --> 01:01:40,090
80, 20 principle. Uh, which, uh,

935
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:43,490
I view is very helpful from
a diagnostic perspective.

936
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:47,090
If you're just looking at first
establishing a baseline, right?

937
01:01:47,091 --> 01:01:51,530
Where are you expending energy,
where are you allocating your time?

938
01:01:51,590 --> 01:01:55,100
What are the results that are coming
from the various categories of activities

939
01:01:55,820 --> 01:01:57,230
and,
uh,

940
01:01:57,231 --> 01:02:01,070
what type of emotional pay off are you
getting or not getting from those things?

941
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:05,360
What are the things you want to
get rid of? It's another way to,

942
01:02:05,540 --> 01:02:08,150
from a sideways angle,

943
01:02:08,510 --> 01:02:12,260
get to what you want is
to also identify what you,

944
01:02:12,290 --> 01:02:14,780
what you would like to subtract,
what are the things you're doing,

945
01:02:14,990 --> 01:02:18,230
the people you're spending time with,
uh, the things you're committing to,

946
01:02:18,231 --> 01:02:18,651
et Cetera,

947
01:02:18,651 --> 01:02:22,830
that you would like to remove that are
causing negative stress as opposed to

948
01:02:22,831 --> 01:02:24,360
positive adaptive stress in your life.

949
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:30,080
So I would suggest those books or
one of them for diagnostic purposes.

950
01:02:31,410 --> 01:02:35,850
And then after that, the natural question
that comes up is, well, what then what,

951
01:02:35,851 --> 01:02:37,380
what do you do?
Uh,

952
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:42,440
hopefully through that assessment process
you'll have some indication of tests

953
01:02:42,631 --> 01:02:43,500
that you can run.

954
01:02:44,130 --> 01:02:49,130
And I say tests or experiments because
it is a very low pressure labeling to

955
01:02:51,271 --> 01:02:51,721
use.

956
01:02:51,721 --> 01:02:56,370
You're not at 27 making a decision
for the rest of your life,

957
01:02:56,670 --> 01:02:57,270
right?

958
01:02:57,270 --> 01:03:02,270
And it's important to frame it that way
because if you view a decision as a five

959
01:03:05,191 --> 01:03:09,810
or 10 year commitment and there are paths
where that is it that that can be the

960
01:03:09,811 --> 01:03:13,770
case, saint medicine, but
outside of a handful of areas,

961
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:19,500
uh, you can look at, in even
in the case of medicine,

962
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:22,380
there are experiments that you could run.
So for instance,

963
01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:27,950
would it be possible if you
are considering traveling
a medical path and thought

964
01:03:28,351 --> 01:03:30,030
that might be something
you'd want to pursue,

965
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:35,390
that you could sit in at a medical school
and audit a class and ask a professor

966
01:03:37,860 --> 01:03:42,660
who has a great reputation among students
and that's easy to figure out with

967
01:03:42,661 --> 01:03:46,910
online course rankings and so on.
Uh,

968
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:48,930
who's one specific teaching awards?

969
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:54,320
Could you sit in and audit a class because
you are considering pursuing medical

970
01:03:54,691 --> 01:03:56,970
school and a career in medicine?

971
01:03:57,630 --> 01:04:01,140
Is that something that you could use it
as an experiment for two weeks to sit in

972
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:06,170
on these classes to give
you more information and
to pay attention to how you

973
01:04:06,361 --> 01:04:11,361
emotionally and emotionally respond to
that to see if it feels like if it could

974
01:04:12,121 --> 01:04:16,700
it be a fit or not. Right? What other
experiments could you run? Well, uh,

975
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:21,600
what you could do after you've done that
or alongside it is try to figure out if

976
01:04:21,601 --> 01:04:26,350
there is a way for you to shadow
someone, say at an emergency room, right?

977
01:04:26,370 --> 01:04:29,550
And this is, this is something
I've actually done. Uh,

978
01:04:29,730 --> 01:04:34,440
and there's no harm in
figuring out how to ask,

979
01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:39,750
uh, how you might do something like that
even if you are ultimately not granted

980
01:04:39,751 --> 01:04:40,321
permission.
Right?

981
01:04:40,321 --> 01:04:45,300
So even in a case that is particularly
seemingly difficult like that there are

982
01:04:45,301 --> 01:04:49,980
experiments you can run and uh,
the,

983
01:04:51,090 --> 01:04:55,980
the upshot of this is that you are
going to need to try a bunch of stuff,

984
01:04:56,660 --> 01:04:57,493
right?

985
01:04:58,290 --> 01:05:03,290
I was not planning on ever writing a book
ever that was not planning on writing

986
01:05:03,631 --> 01:05:06,720
the four hour workweek. I, uh,

987
01:05:06,750 --> 01:05:11,750
had had very difficult experience with
writing my senior thesis as an Undergrad

988
01:05:12,481 --> 01:05:13,530
and I'd sworn to myself,

989
01:05:13,531 --> 01:05:16,200
I would never write anything
longer than email ever again.

990
01:05:16,710 --> 01:05:21,710
So if you had asked me
at age 25 or even 27,

991
01:05:21,821 --> 01:05:26,010
probably if I wanted to write a book,
if I want it to be an author,

992
01:05:26,020 --> 01:05:30,770
the answer would have been
absolutely not hell no. But in the,

993
01:05:30,850 --> 01:05:34,540
in the process, and I did this
accidentally, but you can do it by design.

994
01:05:34,541 --> 01:05:39,390
In the process of teaching classes,
uh,

995
01:05:39,670 --> 01:05:44,670
related to entrepreneurship and getting
a very strong response from students who

996
01:05:44,801 --> 01:05:48,280
are undergrads and, uh, uh,

997
01:05:48,310 --> 01:05:52,720
master's students from
certain aspects of my talks,

998
01:05:52,750 --> 01:05:56,710
I began to think, uh,
it could make sense to,

999
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:59,140
to give a separate guest lecture.

1000
01:05:59,650 --> 01:06:04,600
This is at Princeton at the time focusing
on something that I struggled to label,

1001
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:09,490
but nonetheless ended up calling
lifestyle design as opposed to, uh,

1002
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:14,520
how to build a fast growing a bootstrapped
business and how to engineer that to,

1003
01:06:18,550 --> 01:06:19,383
to function.

1004
01:06:19,810 --> 01:06:24,810
And it was through that
seemingly unrelated practice and,

1005
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:27,850
uh,

1006
01:06:27,850 --> 01:06:32,850
brainstorming that the content for the
four hour work week before the title ever

1007
01:06:32,981 --> 01:06:34,480
existed came about.

1008
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:38,710
And then someone else suggested in effect,

1009
01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:42,910
just like added a snarky comment
to a feedback form at Princeton,

1010
01:06:42,911 --> 01:06:44,860
which is not rare,
which was,

1011
01:06:44,861 --> 01:06:47,890
I don't understand why you're
teaching a class of 40 students.

1012
01:06:47,891 --> 01:06:49,390
Why don't you just write a
book and be done with it?

1013
01:06:49,391 --> 01:06:51,970
Which I don't think it was a serious
recommendation. It was just a Dickish,

1014
01:06:52,330 --> 01:06:56,170
a dickish response from a dickish kid
has been trained to think that's awesome

1015
01:06:56,171 --> 01:06:59,530
at Princeton. But, uh, nonetheless,

1016
01:06:59,531 --> 01:07:04,531
that stuck in my head and I took
notes on possible chapter titles,

1017
01:07:07,150 --> 01:07:09,370
headlines, content, et Cetera,

1018
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:12,160
so that I could get to sleep
because it gave it insomnia.

1019
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:17,700
And then only had conversations with
agents and so on after someone made

1020
01:07:19,511 --> 01:07:23,470
introductions without really asking
me if they could make them or not.

1021
01:07:24,010 --> 01:07:26,740
And then the book was turned
down by 27 publishers. Right?

1022
01:07:26,741 --> 01:07:31,741
So it's almost like that entire path
was something that I turned away from

1023
01:07:33,641 --> 01:07:36,010
multiple times.
And nonetheless,

1024
01:07:36,310 --> 01:07:39,730
it is turned into one of the
greatest gifts I've ever received.

1025
01:07:39,731 --> 01:07:43,510
Certainly that experience paved the way
for everything, including the podcast, uh,

1026
01:07:43,511 --> 01:07:47,200
and failures can also offer
you tremendous opportunities.

1027
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:51,040
Right after the four hour chef,
which really completely burned me out.

1028
01:07:51,470 --> 01:07:55,630
It's a very difficult book to put together
on us, on us, on stay suicide deadline.

1029
01:07:56,290 --> 01:07:59,500
If I had not been burned
out by the four hour chef,

1030
01:07:59,530 --> 01:08:01,450
if I'd still had a lot of gas in the tank,

1031
01:08:01,451 --> 01:08:06,451
I would have never tested the podcast
format as a sandbox for intellectual

1032
01:08:10,630 --> 01:08:15,630
exploration and having the
types of conversations I
now have a weekly basis and

1033
01:08:16,670 --> 01:08:20,630
share with the world never would have
happened if I had not run headfirst into a

1034
01:08:20,631 --> 01:08:25,540
brick wall with the four hour
chef. Uh, so number one, just in,

1035
01:08:25,541 --> 01:08:27,740
in review because I want
to make sure that, um,

1036
01:08:28,110 --> 01:08:32,650
try to summarize this and then have a
chance to call some of the folks. Um,

1037
01:08:33,020 --> 01:08:33,800
number one,

1038
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:38,060
if you're having these feelings of being
unfocused or not sure what to do with

1039
01:08:38,061 --> 01:08:41,120
the rest of your life, that
is normal. And in fact,

1040
01:08:41,121 --> 01:08:45,890
the majority of the world is having that
type of feeling at least a few times a

1041
01:08:45,891 --> 01:08:50,750
year. Uh, so number one, don't
freak out because it's normal. Um,

1042
01:08:50,890 --> 01:08:52,520
and number two is doing assessment.

1043
01:08:52,550 --> 01:08:57,550
You really need to understand where you
are and what your baseline is before you

1044
01:08:58,431 --> 01:09:03,431
can make any type of plans or draw up
possible experiments for finding the

1045
01:09:04,701 --> 01:09:08,090
things that you feel you lack.
That would be the 80,

1046
01:09:08,091 --> 01:09:12,950
20 principle at least as one option
that I think is particularly effective.

1047
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:18,880
And then the second is coming up with
experiments and identifying different ways

1048
01:09:20,721 --> 01:09:25,721
to stick your toe in the
water or different waters
to gauge how that feels and

1049
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:33,280
whether that provides you with some
degree of inner peace or excitement.

1050
01:09:34,850 --> 01:09:35,091
Uh,

1051
01:09:35,091 --> 01:09:40,091
and I do think that those are two pretty
good litmus tests for a lot of the

1052
01:09:40,851 --> 01:09:42,960
decisions that you make
might make in life. You know,

1053
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:48,220
does it excite you and are you excited
to talk to other people about it and uh,

1054
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:53,300
which, which are separate. They don't, you
don't have to check both of those boxes.

1055
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:55,130
And then,
you know,

1056
01:09:55,460 --> 01:10:00,460
how excited are you or a peaceful argue
when you wake up in the morning and how

1057
01:10:00,861 --> 01:10:02,320
easily do you go to sleep,
right?

1058
01:10:02,330 --> 01:10:07,330
Like anything that can facilitate
sort of those four metrics I think,

1059
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:09,560
uh,

1060
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:14,560
generally falls into the good
decision category in my experience.

1061
01:10:15,470 --> 01:10:16,940
Uh,
but a,

1062
01:10:17,270 --> 01:10:20,600
you don't have to figure it out for
the rest of your life and I think it's

1063
01:10:20,601 --> 01:10:25,601
highly likely that you will
at 27 particularly given
the rate of technological

1064
01:10:26,571 --> 01:10:30,440
change and new industries
that will be created, um,

1065
01:10:31,370 --> 01:10:36,170
will in fact have multiple
careers throughout your life. And,

1066
01:10:36,740 --> 01:10:37,573
uh,

1067
01:10:37,790 --> 01:10:41,660
you don't have to figure out which one
to stick with because I think that might

1068
01:10:41,661 --> 01:10:45,020
in fact be a losing
strategy for most people.

1069
01:10:45,110 --> 01:10:50,110
You want to develop skills
and relationships that
transcend any one narrow,

1070
01:10:51,530 --> 01:10:56,240
uh, area of specialty, less
your, you know, some type of

1071
01:10:59,130 --> 01:11:03,660
nanoparticle. A physicist who's, you know,

1072
01:11:03,661 --> 01:11:08,540
committed to really specializing,
that's fine too. But from the,

1073
01:11:08,570 --> 01:11:12,730
from the sound of, of, of,
of where describing, um,

1074
01:11:13,620 --> 01:11:16,350
I would say experimentation,
experiment, experiment, experiment.

1075
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:18,953
Does that help at all?

1076
01:11:19,370 --> 01:11:20,203
Yes.

1077
01:11:25,410 --> 01:11:28,320
I appreciate your thorough answers.
It never does disappoint

1078
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:30,810
my pleasure. You know,
I'm just trying to make,

1079
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:33,420
make something up that sounds believable.
So I'm glad it

1080
01:11:36,570 --> 01:11:39,570
aid you in any way that it
is genuinely though how I've,

1081
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:41,710
how I've approached things,
uh,

1082
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:46,630
with very rare deviation for the last say,

1083
01:11:46,890 --> 01:11:50,850
certainly the last decade and I
would say even a little bit longer.

1084
01:11:51,330 --> 01:11:54,840
So I'm going to let you
get back to your day. Uh,

1085
01:11:55,410 --> 01:11:59,880
but thanks for blending and ear and
thanks for filling out the form.

1086
01:12:03,180 --> 01:12:05,550
I'll ask you again about the cocktails,
but until then,

1087
01:12:05,850 --> 01:12:08,620
thanks for the call and said, I appreciate
everything. You have a good day. Right?

1088
01:12:08,890 --> 01:12:09,990
All right,
you too man.

1089
01:12:10,110 --> 01:12:15,110
Bye Mcneil.

1090
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:16,980
I getting that pronunciation right.

1091
01:12:19,460 --> 01:12:20,293
It is for me.

1092
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:24,530
Well, it's not speak to you soon. I
might flip the whole thing, but we'll,

1093
01:12:24,770 --> 01:12:27,200
we'll see how it goes.
How are you this afternoon?

1094
01:12:34,460 --> 01:12:34,880
Grind?

1095
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:35,713
Yeah.

1096
01:12:36,150 --> 01:12:36,983
First,

1097
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:39,020
you know,
there's,

1098
01:12:39,020 --> 01:12:41,660
there can be a time and a place that
can be a time and a place for it.

1099
01:12:41,930 --> 01:12:45,500
So how can I try to be of assistance?

1100
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:48,440
I can't promise good answers,
but I'll, I'll do my best.

1101
01:12:49,450 --> 01:12:51,860
Awesome. Well, you know, it's team,

1102
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:56,710
they might not be as good,

1103
01:12:56,970 --> 01:12:57,803
but,
uh,

1104
01:12:59,090 --> 01:13:03,670
today was a regarding
relationships and you know, uh,

1105
01:13:04,230 --> 01:13:09,020
basically you, you're very methodical
in everything that you do. Uh, you know,

1106
01:13:09,021 --> 01:13:14,021
you kind of plan ahead and you always
like try and anticipate any downsides and

1107
01:13:14,210 --> 01:13:16,310
plan for those Yada Yada.
Um,

1108
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:19,850
so that's kind of my mindset and
I've learned a lot of that from you.

1109
01:13:20,210 --> 01:13:25,210
I was wondering how can I do that in
a relationship where my partner and my

1110
01:13:25,731 --> 01:13:30,530
girlfriend is and isn't
really so prone to that or um,

1111
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:36,100
kind of bottles up or doesn't want
to plan due to the anxiety of it.

1112
01:13:41,490 --> 01:13:45,570
I think we have some, we have some
fertile ground to explore here.

1113
01:13:45,571 --> 01:13:50,571
So I might rely on followup
questions from you to direct this.

1114
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:55,980
But, uh, I can tell you how
I used to think about it now,

1115
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:58,860
how I think about it,
which is evolving

1116
01:14:00,850 --> 01:14:04,230
as we speak.
But I realized

1117
01:14:05,910 --> 01:14:10,910
in the last say five to 10 years that
my ultimate nightmare would be dating a

1118
01:14:13,721 --> 01:14:15,580
long tear version of myself.

1119
01:14:16,270 --> 01:14:21,270
So they're the sort of assumption
number one is that I am looking for a

1120
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:25,900
compliment,

1121
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:29,920
someone who is a compliment and I
have a fantastic girlfriend right now.

1122
01:14:29,921 --> 01:14:34,720
We've been together for a pretty
decent stretch of time and,

1123
01:14:34,810 --> 01:14:37,870
uh, she, she's proven to
be a fantastic compliment.

1124
01:14:37,871 --> 01:14:42,440
I can explain what that means in a
second to me as it stands right now, uh,

1125
01:14:42,810 --> 01:14:45,700
I am not looking for a duplicate.

1126
01:14:46,180 --> 01:14:48,460
And at the same time,

1127
01:14:48,490 --> 01:14:53,050
I'm looking for someone
with shared values, right?

1128
01:14:53,050 --> 01:14:54,700
How do they view truth?

1129
01:14:55,030 --> 01:14:59,530
How do they define success if
they define success at all?

1130
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:02,620
Right?
So they should be shared value could be,

1131
01:15:03,130 --> 01:15:06,410
and I think it is on many levels,
uh,

1132
01:15:06,730 --> 01:15:11,730
how you define certain terms that people
tend to strive for or strive to avoid

1133
01:15:14,350 --> 01:15:18,520
and how you answer certain key
life questions. Outside of that,

1134
01:15:19,090 --> 01:15:22,450
there's a lot of room for flexibility.

1135
01:15:23,020 --> 01:15:28,020
And what I have found is for me at least,

1136
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:33,610
uh,
what is helpful when you perceive,

1137
01:15:34,270 --> 01:15:37,750
say, I'm fucking, get
myself in trouble here.

1138
01:15:38,850 --> 01:15:40,250
Let's say

1139
01:15:46,470 --> 01:15:50,600
we're both, I can't blame
it on the booze. Um, so,

1140
01:15:51,260 --> 01:15:55,370
uh, and, and this applies to the last, uh,

1141
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:58,300
probably the last four or
five relationships I've had,

1142
01:15:58,301 --> 01:16:02,790
which have all been with
incredible women, uh, and, um,

1143
01:16:03,310 --> 01:16:08,310
brilliantly strong women in different
ways that I separate in my mind what is a

1144
01:16:12,730 --> 01:16:17,730
emotional fragility or lack of
resilience from sensitivity?

1145
01:16:21,250 --> 01:16:25,230
And I think this is a really important
distinction, which I didn't by the way,

1146
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:28,480
draw for myself for many decades
and I think it did a lot of damage.

1147
01:16:28,481 --> 01:16:29,314
In other words,

1148
01:16:30,460 --> 01:16:35,110
sensitivity to me is reflective.
Uh,

1149
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:40,360
have to use one, a metaphor,
a precision instrument,

1150
01:16:40,660 --> 01:16:45,550
right? So if you have a scale that gives
you your weight but it's in 10 pound

1151
01:16:45,551 --> 01:16:46,180
increments,

1152
01:16:46,180 --> 01:16:50,890
that is less sensitive than a scale that
gives you a pound by pound increments

1153
01:16:51,070 --> 01:16:56,070
and a very sensitive scale
would give you down to the gram.

1154
01:16:56,260 --> 01:16:57,960
And so on.
Uh,

1155
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:03,480
the question then is how someone
wields that sensitivity and uh,

1156
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:10,040
whether it is a help or
a liability or when it,

1157
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:14,480
or asking the question, when is that
sensitivity a help or a liability?

1158
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:17,900
So you find,
I think that historically for me,

1159
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:22,960
I have viewed any type of feeling
of feelings to be unhelpful,

1160
01:17:25,610 --> 01:17:30,610
to be a primitive clouding
of logical analysis

1161
01:17:32,870 --> 01:17:36,860
and uh, uh, for a long time. Therefore,

1162
01:17:36,950 --> 01:17:41,950
my response to emotional responses
in myself was to stuff them down,

1163
01:17:45,860 --> 01:17:50,330
cut them off, mute them,
turn down the volume.

1164
01:17:50,660 --> 01:17:53,860
And as a result, I made some
really bad decisions. Uh,

1165
01:17:53,930 --> 01:17:55,910
there were times when it was helpful.
Yeah.

1166
01:18:04,700 --> 01:18:07,230
Yeah. And you use both.
Right? So I think that it's,

1167
01:18:07,370 --> 01:18:10,430
it's a mistake to
exclusively rely on either,

1168
01:18:10,850 --> 01:18:12,530
but the,

1169
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:18,240
there is a lot to be said for the hundreds
and thousands and millions of years

1170
01:18:19,521 --> 01:18:24,521
of evolution that have given us rapid
processing ability that doesn't have to

1171
01:18:25,851 --> 01:18:30,851
run through a four quadrant
grid in the analytical mind.

1172
01:18:31,310 --> 01:18:34,310
There's a lot to be said for it,
right? If a deal looks great,

1173
01:18:34,550 --> 01:18:38,310
but you get the Heebie jeebies from person
you were doing the deal with, I pay,

1174
01:18:38,311 --> 01:18:39,380
it's a lot of attention to that.

1175
01:18:39,620 --> 01:18:44,620
The reason I bring it up is that I think
it is equally easy to say date a in

1176
01:18:47,181 --> 01:18:47,931
this case,
you know,

1177
01:18:47,931 --> 01:18:52,931
we're both dating women date a
woman or a partner who is very,

1178
01:18:53,061 --> 01:18:57,750
very sensitive and to mistake
that for weakness, right?

1179
01:18:57,770 --> 01:19:02,150
So one thing that I try to do is to
get a very clear understanding of how

1180
01:19:02,151 --> 01:19:06,020
sensitive their instrument
is. Med, for instance, uh,

1181
01:19:06,050 --> 01:19:07,190
one of my ex girlfriends,

1182
01:19:07,220 --> 01:19:10,400
I only realized after we'd been
together for several years,

1183
01:19:10,820 --> 01:19:13,190
that when she walked down the street,

1184
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:18,280
she was so empathically receptive that
she could basically feel the pain and

1185
01:19:20,961 --> 01:19:21,980
emotions,

1186
01:19:22,190 --> 01:19:26,240
almost like a contagion of people as she
passed them walking down the sidewalk.

1187
01:19:26,241 --> 01:19:31,241
Like walking down the sidewalk in New
York City was incredibly emotionally

1188
01:19:31,581 --> 01:19:36,020
depleting for her. And I did not, I
didn't realize she was that sensitive.

1189
01:19:36,380 --> 01:19:40,840
I didn't, and that's not a, uh,

1190
01:19:40,970 --> 01:19:45,050
it's not a value judgment. It is an
assessment of Eicher instrumentation.

1191
01:19:46,010 --> 01:19:50,690
And that changed how I related to what
I'd previously perceived as like very

1192
01:19:50,691 --> 01:19:55,370
unreasonable and maybe immature responses
to things. Does that make sense?

1193
01:19:56,090 --> 01:20:00,790
So that's, that's kind of 0.1. And, uh,

1194
01:20:01,550 --> 01:20:04,130
I find it also very,

1195
01:20:04,850 --> 01:20:09,850
I find it more productive these days
and I should say right off the bat,

1196
01:20:10,891 --> 01:20:13,470
which I didn't,
that uh,

1197
01:20:13,860 --> 01:20:16,590
many people have suggested or asked me,

1198
01:20:16,591 --> 01:20:18,900
what are you going to write the for
our relationship and aside from as a

1199
01:20:18,901 --> 01:20:20,130
terrible sounding title,

1200
01:20:20,580 --> 01:20:25,020
the fact of the matter is I don't
think I have right now a whole lot to

1201
01:20:25,021 --> 01:20:26,910
contribute to that conversation.

1202
01:20:26,940 --> 01:20:29,460
There are 1,000,001 books out
there about relationships.

1203
01:20:29,461 --> 01:20:31,720
Some of them are very good.
Uh,

1204
01:20:31,770 --> 01:20:35,010
I think the five love languages is
actually an excellent book and it's been

1205
01:20:35,011 --> 01:20:39,990
recommended to me by, by some of the
most impressive humans on the planet. Uh,

1206
01:20:39,991 --> 01:20:40,824
off the record.

1207
01:20:44,910 --> 01:20:49,890
That might be a separate one.
The five love languages.

1208
01:20:52,830 --> 01:20:56,740
No, no, no. I mean maybe somebody
should write that one too. Uh,

1209
01:20:56,790 --> 01:21:01,790
the five love languages I do think for
particularly for very Spock admiring left

1210
01:21:06,481 --> 01:21:11,481
brainers and I know that the left and
right brain functions are not as cleanly

1211
01:21:11,791 --> 01:21:14,130
delineated as this,
but just for the sake of simplicity,

1212
01:21:14,610 --> 01:21:18,450
that book is very helpful. And, uh,

1213
01:21:18,490 --> 01:21:22,230
where I was going to go
next though is that, uh,

1214
01:21:22,770 --> 01:21:25,230
for,
for quite a long time,

1215
01:21:25,231 --> 01:21:30,231
my response to perceived
weakness was frustration.

1216
01:21:31,260 --> 01:21:34,360
And it still is sometimes,
uh,

1217
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:39,680
the frustration was based on my
perception of whatever their reaction was.

1218
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:45,510
And I had no, I had no visibility
into their internal process.

1219
01:21:46,050 --> 01:21:48,570
This goes by the way for employees,
it goes for everybody,

1220
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:53,280
not just significant others.
And what,

1221
01:21:53,370 --> 01:21:53,990
uh,
I've,

1222
01:21:53,990 --> 01:21:58,990
but I've certainly come to practice a
lot more is before getting frustrated,

1223
01:22:00,420 --> 01:22:02,610
asking what they're experiencing,

1224
01:22:03,150 --> 01:22:06,440
asking them to describe
how they're feeling it,

1225
01:22:06,660 --> 01:22:10,860
recognizing that their response
exists whether you want it to or not.

1226
01:22:10,860 --> 01:22:14,790
So you might as well have a bit more
resolution on what they're actually

1227
01:22:14,791 --> 01:22:19,500
experiencing. And it can end
up being very, very reasonable.

1228
01:22:21,210 --> 01:22:25,530
And not only that, but even if it is
from your perspective, unreasonable,

1229
01:22:26,160 --> 01:22:26,730
uh,

1230
01:22:26,730 --> 01:22:31,730
simply recognizing that their
experience is valid and even saying,

1231
01:22:32,041 --> 01:22:36,600
I can see how ABNC it would be
very difficult. I totally hear you.

1232
01:22:36,630 --> 01:22:37,560
I could see that.

1233
01:22:37,740 --> 01:22:40,980
And can I have friends who
have experienced similar
things or I've experienced

1234
01:22:40,981 --> 01:22:41,814
similar things,

1235
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:47,360
often diffuses the situation without you
having to offer a solution at all or to

1236
01:22:51,930 --> 01:22:55,330
such a critique the response.
Um,

1237
01:22:56,100 --> 01:23:01,020
so that's another sort of
consideration. Um, there is a,

1238
01:23:01,410 --> 01:23:03,870
this is the type of thing that's
probably going to get me in trouble,

1239
01:23:03,871 --> 01:23:04,530
but here it goes.

1240
01:23:04,530 --> 01:23:09,530
So that the 20% of you out there who
just love to kind of sport outrage on the

1241
01:23:11,981 --> 01:23:16,560
Internet, you can use this
one. Uh, uh, there's a, there,

1242
01:23:16,610 --> 01:23:18,610
there's a book that I highly,

1243
01:23:18,611 --> 01:23:21,880
highly recommend for everyone to read
and I've recommended it before for many,

1244
01:23:21,881 --> 01:23:24,260
many different situations,
uh,

1245
01:23:24,310 --> 01:23:28,060
or to as education and a toolkit for many,

1246
01:23:28,061 --> 01:23:30,580
many types of challenges that can crop up.

1247
01:23:30,940 --> 01:23:34,810
There's a book called don't shoot the dog,
which is written by,

1248
01:23:35,490 --> 01:23:39,970
I believe it's Karen Pryor and it's at,

1249
01:23:39,971 --> 01:23:44,971
it's at its most basic a book about a
positive reinforcement and it happens to

1250
01:23:49,270 --> 01:23:54,070
teach a lot of lessons
through discussion of, uh,

1251
01:23:54,580 --> 01:23:59,290
sort of animal conditioning, right?
Marine animals, dolphins and so on.

1252
01:23:59,291 --> 01:24:03,940
Also looking at every
possible creature imaginable.

1253
01:24:03,970 --> 01:24:08,620
And I think the back copy of the back
cover of this book says something like

1254
01:24:08,621 --> 01:24:13,480
whether you want the cat to get off of
your kitchen table or like your mother in

1255
01:24:13,481 --> 01:24:18,010
law to stop nagging you, this book
will give you the tools you need,

1256
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:20,730
something like that.
And uh,

1257
01:24:21,010 --> 01:24:25,370
the title I think does not do
justice to the book. Uh, but it's,

1258
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:29,950
it's very useful,
particularly when you,

1259
01:24:29,980 --> 01:24:31,330
how long have you been
dating your girlfriend?

1260
01:24:31,610 --> 01:24:33,870
Yeah,
it'll be like two and a half years.

1261
01:24:35,610 --> 01:24:39,910
Okay. So two and a half, three years
in both of you probably have a,

1262
01:24:39,950 --> 01:24:44,070
I think this is true for
most couples by this point.

1263
01:24:44,310 --> 01:24:48,660
Certain triggers for each other.

1264
01:24:49,230 --> 01:24:52,950
You have certain ha ensure you have
habits that annoy the shit out of her.

1265
01:24:53,370 --> 01:24:54,960
Maybe she bites her lip,
maybe she does it.

1266
01:24:54,961 --> 01:24:59,961
I'm sure she has a few that drive you
nuts and they're probably also exchanges

1267
01:25:00,210 --> 01:25:05,210
where in you end up in a self
perpetuating cycle of some type.

1268
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:09,450
Right. And like I'm, I'm not saying this
is trivia relationship, but for instance,

1269
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:13,980
right, like you perceive her as
being clingy or needy in some ways.

1270
01:25:13,981 --> 01:25:16,050
So you push away or shut down,

1271
01:25:16,051 --> 01:25:18,300
which makes her even more
fearful that you're withdrawing.

1272
01:25:18,301 --> 01:25:21,570
So she doubles down on the
cleanness and the neediness,

1273
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:23,690
then you double down on the
pushing away and it's just

1274
01:25:25,890 --> 01:25:28,770
that type of dynamic x,
it might exist.

1275
01:25:29,220 --> 01:25:31,230
So in those types of dynamics,

1276
01:25:31,260 --> 01:25:36,260
it's very useful to have
as a reference point,

1277
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:41,880
a book like this that covers principles
of positive reinforcement, right?

1278
01:25:41,881 --> 01:25:43,980
Because the negative reinforcement

1279
01:25:46,110 --> 01:25:50,400
can work, but there are a lot of
side effects. Does that make sense?

1280
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:54,810
So sec for instance,
and this book is a lot of examples.

1281
01:25:55,340 --> 01:25:57,120
Uh, negative reinforcement can work. Yeah.

1282
01:25:57,121 --> 01:26:01,980
It's like if you want to use
a shock collar with a dog,
uh, and I'm, by the way,

1283
01:26:01,981 --> 01:26:05,630
just for everybody out who's just like
waiting to throw pitchforks at my head,

1284
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:09,530
I'm not comparing women to dogs.

1285
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:14,180
I'm comparing humans to
animals because we are animals.

1286
01:26:14,310 --> 01:26:17,820
All right? So just chill the
fuck out. Right? Uh, and,

1287
01:26:17,821 --> 01:26:22,190
and I think a lot of our problems day
to day quite frankly is thinking that we

1288
01:26:22,191 --> 01:26:27,040
are uniquely special,
uh,

1289
01:26:27,670 --> 01:26:31,610
like
animals when a,

1290
01:26:31,611 --> 01:26:35,720
for most intents and purposes, that's
just not the case at all. Like there's,

1291
01:26:35,721 --> 01:26:40,721
there's plenty of great literature and
science that we can review to get a

1292
01:26:40,881 --> 01:26:45,881
better understanding of why
we do some silly things and,

1293
01:26:46,101 --> 01:26:50,000
uh, engaged in self defeating
behavior and thought patterns,

1294
01:26:50,001 --> 01:26:52,730
which from an evolutionary standpoint,
make a lot of sense.

1295
01:26:52,790 --> 01:26:56,450
So this is part of that,
that education for me at least,

1296
01:26:56,600 --> 01:27:00,980
and the benefit of it is what are the
benefits is that you're not reading about

1297
01:27:00,981 --> 01:27:05,510
evolutionary biology in a purely
theoretical or abstract way.

1298
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:10,700
I mean, there's some great books by
Dawkins and others that can inform this

1299
01:27:10,701 --> 01:27:11,534
conversation.

1300
01:27:11,690 --> 01:27:15,860
What's nice about something like a
don't shoot the dog is that it gives you

1301
01:27:15,861 --> 01:27:20,660
tools you could immediately practice
in real life. Uh, so that's,

1302
01:27:20,661 --> 01:27:25,661
that's one I would suggest that will give
you an alternative Palette of options,

1303
01:27:26,180 --> 01:27:28,700
mixing a lot of metaphors,
Palette of colors, I, he,

1304
01:27:28,701 --> 01:27:32,990
options that you can paint with when
you're, you're in these situations.

1305
01:27:33,550 --> 01:27:36,190
Uh, and, uh, give me another,

1306
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:39,170
can you give me a specific example of,

1307
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:43,910
of a situation or a response is
something that you wish were different,

1308
01:27:43,940 --> 01:27:47,540
whether it's ongoing, uh, preferably
something that repeats, right?

1309
01:27:47,541 --> 01:27:48,770
Something that you see repeatedly.

1310
01:27:54,590 --> 01:27:58,530
She's going to kill
me.

1311
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:05,470
Robert, Robert, Robert,

1312
01:28:08,770 --> 01:28:10,300
Robert. Don't worry about it. Continue.

1313
01:28:10,730 --> 01:28:12,540
Oh, yes, yes, yes, exactly.

1314
01:28:16,220 --> 01:28:19,610
You know, income inequality, right.

1315
01:28:20,330 --> 01:28:22,040
I do make a little bit more than her,
which is,

1316
01:28:22,730 --> 01:28:26,630
I'm sure there's always
income disparity, but, uh, I,

1317
01:28:26,660 --> 01:28:30,470
I've always been very frugal my whole
life, like in terms of, you know,

1318
01:28:31,130 --> 01:28:35,190
all we save a ton, don't live
beyond your means or whatever. Uh,

1319
01:28:35,510 --> 01:28:40,430
and anytime I tried and talk financials,
it just, I get shot down. There's no, uh,

1320
01:28:40,940 --> 01:28:44,420
there's no discussion to be
had. It's just, well, you
have yours and I have mine.

1321
01:28:44,421 --> 01:28:48,770
Let's just figure it out for
somebody. I wanna, you know,

1322
01:28:49,070 --> 01:28:52,340
and the rest of them, rest of my
life where it becomes difficult,

1323
01:28:52,341 --> 01:28:56,420
especially when I've been raised.
Um, so financially conscious

1324
01:28:56,820 --> 01:29:00,220
as I am. Okay. This is a good example.

1325
01:29:00,870 --> 01:29:02,490
And because it's,
it's a,

1326
01:29:02,610 --> 01:29:07,110
it represents a really
common source of friction.

1327
01:29:08,940 --> 01:29:11,100
Really, really common. I
mean, this is, this is,

1328
01:29:11,130 --> 01:29:16,130
this is not a rare conversation and it's
not a rare conversation where one or

1329
01:29:17,521 --> 01:29:18,610
more parties shut down.

1330
01:29:18,670 --> 01:29:23,010
So I can only speak to tools
that have been helpful to me.

1331
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:28,410
I'll, uh, speak to a tool that's
been helpful to me and also a buffer.

1332
01:29:28,740 --> 01:29:30,480
And I'll explain what I mean by that.

1333
01:29:31,350 --> 01:29:36,350
So the tool which can become a bit
rote and repetitive if you overuse it,

1334
01:29:37,110 --> 01:29:41,530
is a nonviolent communication. And, uh,

1335
01:29:41,550 --> 01:29:43,980
there are many books on the subject.
Uh,

1336
01:29:43,981 --> 01:29:48,981
there is a particular audio
book version that Neil Strauss,

1337
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:53,490
eight or nine time New York Times
bestselling author recommended it to me.

1338
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:58,440
I believe the first name is Marshall,
the author. The audio book has,

1339
01:29:58,441 --> 01:30:02,940
I think a peace sign on the cover and
it's several hours long. In any case,

1340
01:30:02,970 --> 01:30:04,230
nonviolent communication.

1341
01:30:04,260 --> 01:30:07,320
You can certainly read the
Wikipedia entry for the basics,

1342
01:30:07,710 --> 01:30:11,220
but in effect,
it is a,

1343
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:17,070
it is an approach to communication that,
uh,

1344
01:30:17,370 --> 01:30:21,870
aims. And I'm probably going
to piss off a bunch of,

1345
01:30:22,110 --> 01:30:24,200
uh,
nonviolent communication,

1346
01:30:24,210 --> 01:30:26,700
black belts out there who are going
to say that I got it all wrong.

1347
01:30:26,701 --> 01:30:29,370
But for the purposes of
our conversation right now,

1348
01:30:29,700 --> 01:30:34,470
to minimize the likelihood of provoking
a strong emotional response in the

1349
01:30:34,471 --> 01:30:39,000
person you're speaking with
and in yourself. And the,

1350
01:30:39,001 --> 01:30:42,960
I'm going to try to,
to sort of recall this template right now,

1351
01:30:42,961 --> 01:30:44,100
there are different ways to approach it,

1352
01:30:44,101 --> 01:30:49,101
but the way it will generally
start is along the lines of,

1353
01:30:49,710 --> 01:30:53,880
you know,
when a B and c happened or when you did A,

1354
01:30:53,881 --> 01:30:55,770
B and c and the F,

1355
01:30:55,790 --> 01:31:00,120
this first part is has to be objective.

1356
01:31:00,180 --> 01:31:02,880
It cannot be debatable,
right?

1357
01:31:02,881 --> 01:31:06,690
So it could be something like
when we agreed, uh, you know,

1358
01:31:06,691 --> 01:31:11,430
when we agreed to meet at three o'clock
and you turned up at three 20, it's what,

1359
01:31:11,490 --> 01:31:16,230
it's, what a video camera
would have recorded. Uh,

1360
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:19,420
it makes me feel x,
uh,

1361
01:31:19,890 --> 01:31:24,000
because I have a need for why,
right?

1362
01:31:24,001 --> 01:31:29,001
It makes me feel sad because I have a
need to feel that we're in this together

1363
01:31:30,961 --> 01:31:35,280
and that we're, we're going to always
strive to keep commitments to each other.

1364
01:31:35,430 --> 01:31:38,790
Uh, and then there's a specific ask,
which is like, would you be willing to,

1365
01:31:38,850 --> 01:31:41,940
and the the would you be willing
to, could be anything. It could be,

1366
01:31:41,941 --> 01:31:46,350
would you be willing to set aside a
time to have a conversation about this

1367
01:31:46,650 --> 01:31:48,270
anytime that's convenient for you?

1368
01:31:48,390 --> 01:31:53,080
It's really important to me because
for instance, in your case, like I,

1369
01:31:53,510 --> 01:31:56,010
I literally want to spend the
rest of my life with you and I,

1370
01:31:56,490 --> 01:32:01,120
this is important to me because I was
raised a and c like would you be willing

1371
01:32:01,150 --> 01:32:04,350
for us to set aside some time
whenever is convenient for you?

1372
01:32:04,370 --> 01:32:07,890
Put it in the calendar so we can
actually talk about this. Uh,

1373
01:32:08,290 --> 01:32:11,920
and it's a template. The goal
being what I described previously,

1374
01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:17,640
I would look into nonviolent communication
for these types of conversations that

1375
01:32:18,041 --> 01:32:18,781
have storico.

1376
01:32:18,781 --> 01:32:23,781
He produced the same response whether
in your partner or in yourself.

1377
01:32:24,250 --> 01:32:25,083
Right.

1378
01:32:25,570 --> 01:32:29,470
And then the buffer that I was
mentioning is in this took me,

1379
01:32:29,471 --> 01:32:34,471
it's so obvious and yet it took me 41
42 I can't even remember how old I am

1380
01:32:35,411 --> 01:32:37,720
right now,
but whatever my age is right now,

1381
01:32:38,830 --> 01:32:42,400
I should have figured this out earlier.
And that is,

1382
01:32:42,700 --> 01:32:46,240
it's not just the message,
it's the Messenger.

1383
01:32:46,330 --> 01:32:51,160
And what I mean by that is when,
when you get into a pattern,

1384
01:32:51,220 --> 01:32:55,180
this is in my experience
where a partner says a,

1385
01:32:55,210 --> 01:33:00,100
the other partner shuts down or respond
to the B and it's just groundhog day

1386
01:33:00,310 --> 01:33:04,450
that what's what may
be needed and it's not,

1387
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:05,740
they're not mutually exclusive.

1388
01:33:05,770 --> 01:33:10,770
What might be required at both is not the
perfect word smithing that is going to

1389
01:33:11,981 --> 01:33:15,190
be like you're Luke
Skywalker in star wars,

1390
01:33:15,191 --> 01:33:17,710
like shooting through down
the line and the death star.

1391
01:33:17,950 --> 01:33:22,950
Like it's not the perfect prose paragraph
that's going to just be stow this

1392
01:33:23,530 --> 01:33:27,370
miraculous epiphany upon your girlfriend
is going to be like, oh my God,

1393
01:33:27,371 --> 01:33:28,690
now I see it.
Right.

1394
01:33:29,110 --> 01:33:34,110
Rather than hoping to like craft the
perfect Gettysburg address that's going to

1395
01:33:34,421 --> 01:33:36,580
like revolutionize how
she thinks about finances.

1396
01:33:37,090 --> 01:33:41,860
Maybe she just needs to hear exactly
what you're saying through someone who is

1397
01:33:41,861 --> 01:33:45,970
less threatening or with whom she has
an established that pattern. Right.

1398
01:33:45,971 --> 01:33:49,270
And then I'm sure that I,
again,

1399
01:33:49,330 --> 01:33:53,290
I'm not a relationship counselor,
but in my experience when I'm like,

1400
01:33:53,291 --> 01:33:55,330
I can't believe she does x,

1401
01:33:55,660 --> 01:34:00,390
I usually have a very active
role in provoking that
somehow. Right. So it's, it's,

1402
01:34:00,690 --> 01:34:04,840
it's likely that the credit slash
blame is shared by both parties.

1403
01:34:05,700 --> 01:34:08,040
Uh, but in the last, uh,

1404
01:34:08,080 --> 01:34:10,840
year or so I have been,

1405
01:34:11,140 --> 01:34:15,880
and I'm like embarrassed to admit this,
I don't know what that's about.

1406
01:34:15,881 --> 01:34:18,840
We can unpack that another time, but, uh,

1407
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:23,880
found a relationship coach to meet with
or speak with on a regular basis and she

1408
01:34:25,751 --> 01:34:28,000
will speak to me individually.

1409
01:34:28,001 --> 01:34:31,660
She'll speak to my girlfriend individually
and then we'll have group calls,

1410
01:34:32,590 --> 01:34:33,423
uh,

1411
01:34:33,700 --> 01:34:38,700
has enabled my girlfriend to say things
or convey things to me through someone

1412
01:34:39,581 --> 01:34:42,370
else who can also act as
a reality check for her.

1413
01:34:44,780 --> 01:34:49,780
And for me when I have a
concern or a criticism,

1414
01:34:50,770 --> 01:34:55,770
she's more than willing to tell me that
she thinks it's unreasonable or that

1415
01:34:56,650 --> 01:35:00,440
I'm, and as she's put it, she's,

1416
01:35:00,470 --> 01:35:03,680
she's not for either one of us.
She's for the relationship.

1417
01:35:03,890 --> 01:35:08,890
And how did having someone who is a
regular part of your fostering of the

1418
01:35:11,901 --> 01:35:16,580
relationship as a couple, even
when there is not a problem, right?

1419
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:21,600
Ku is consistently there to ensure that
like the plants are watered before they

1420
01:35:22,011 --> 01:35:25,640
start dying has been incredibly,

1421
01:35:25,641 --> 01:35:30,641
incredibly helpful and can diffuse a
lot of this stuff through a myriad of,

1422
01:35:32,390 --> 01:35:34,680
uh, of different factors. Uh,

1423
01:35:34,820 --> 01:35:39,820
one of which being you can say to this
say relationship coach or whoever you

1424
01:35:40,731 --> 01:35:45,731
might choose to work with therapists that
you'd really like to bring this up in

1425
01:35:46,161 --> 01:35:49,400
a safe space where the three of you can
talk about it and where she can voice

1426
01:35:49,401 --> 01:35:52,880
her concerns to you maybe separately,
maybe together.

1427
01:35:53,360 --> 01:35:58,220
And having someone to facilitate that is,

1428
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:02,870
uh, at least in my experience over the
last year, extremely, extremely helpful.

1429
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:08,680
It is also helpful if you or anyone like
me can get a bit overwhelmed or feel

1430
01:36:12,021 --> 01:36:17,021
overwhelmed when a partner comes
to me with emotional challenges.

1431
01:36:17,630 --> 01:36:20,650
Right. And you, me, at some point
you'll have to develop the ability,

1432
01:36:20,680 --> 01:36:21,560
I'm not saying you don't,

1433
01:36:21,860 --> 01:36:26,810
I will have to develop the ability and
I am to kind of better just sit and

1434
01:36:26,811 --> 01:36:31,490
witness the experience of an emotional
challenge without having to like

1435
01:36:31,491 --> 01:36:34,940
immediately jump in and offer solutions
within 30 seconds and be like, okay,

1436
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:38,730
right problem. Got It. Let's
be solution focused. Uh,

1437
01:36:39,130 --> 01:36:40,920
which left brain go.
Yeah.

1438
01:36:40,970 --> 01:36:44,720
Which surprise surprise not
always make things better.

1439
01:36:45,140 --> 01:36:50,040
Uh, I'm, I'm getting better
at that. And it's, it's, it,

1440
01:36:50,270 --> 01:36:54,560
it's a process of practicing and training
and so on from it because it doesn't

1441
01:36:54,561 --> 01:36:56,800
come very naturally,
uh,

1442
01:36:58,040 --> 01:37:03,040
to have someone else that your partner
can vent to who is not you is really

1443
01:37:05,630 --> 01:37:10,630
worth the money and time in and of
itself and who you can vent too,

1444
01:37:10,641 --> 01:37:11,241
by the way,

1445
01:37:11,241 --> 01:37:16,241
so that you don't blow up over dinner
or God knows what at your part and then

1446
01:37:17,690 --> 01:37:20,750
say to yourself for the next two weeks,
for fuck's sake, why did I do that?

1447
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:24,860
What a like 12 car pile
up of emotional trauma.

1448
01:37:24,861 --> 01:37:29,480
I have to now try to clean up this.
So that's the buffer that,

1449
01:37:29,510 --> 01:37:31,160
that I might,
I might suggest,

1450
01:37:31,161 --> 01:37:36,140
and it's relatively new to me to have
that because I like to think that I don't

1451
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:40,370
need things like that and to have
realized that that's, uh, it,

1452
01:37:40,371 --> 01:37:44,840
at least from my experience so far,
very penny wise and pound foolish,

1453
01:37:44,990 --> 01:37:49,990
particularly if it sounds like you're
very committed to being with your

1454
01:37:50,510 --> 01:37:54,770
girlfriend and want to be with her
for a very, very, very long time. Uh,

1455
01:37:55,260 --> 01:37:58,580
so those are, those are
a few of my thoughts. Uh,

1456
01:37:59,070 --> 01:38:01,680
I don't know how helpful those
are, but they've been, they've,

1457
01:38:01,770 --> 01:38:04,890
they've been helpful
certainly to me thus far.

1458
01:38:11,610 --> 01:38:16,190
And
um,

1459
01:38:17,500 --> 01:38:19,170
fired one five love languages.

1460
01:38:20,070 --> 01:38:25,070
Don't shoot the dog nonviolent
communication and don't
shoot the dog by Karen

1461
01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:26,333
Pryor.
Right.

1462
01:38:27,370 --> 01:38:31,640
And then some messenger is
another one. I was like, yeah,

1463
01:38:31,700 --> 01:38:36,110
it's not always about the message for me
playing in my head. Uh, thank you again.

1464
01:38:36,140 --> 01:38:38,820
I just wanted to say thank you,
uh,

1465
01:38:38,870 --> 01:38:41,150
for everything that you
do and for the call today.

1466
01:38:41,650 --> 01:38:44,370
I hope you have a wonderful
rest of the day and uh,

1467
01:38:44,870 --> 01:38:47,210
hopefully this makes it to the podcast.
If not,

1468
01:38:47,240 --> 01:38:49,640
is it possible to send
a recording of it to me

1469
01:38:50,700 --> 01:38:55,120
podcast? I'm sure. I'm sure this will
end up on the pod test, so don't worry,

1470
01:38:55,121 --> 01:38:58,800
it'll be just a, you, Robert, me and

1471
01:39:00,590 --> 01:39:02,680
a couple of, couple of, a
couple of million best friends.

1472
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:09,840
All right, good luck and thank you.
You're welcome. Have a great day.

1473
01:39:10,320 --> 01:39:13,710
Bye Bye. Hey guys, this is Tim again.

1474
01:39:13,711 --> 01:39:16,860
Just a few more things before
you take off. Number one,

1475
01:39:17,130 --> 01:39:22,050
this is five bullet Friday.
Do you want to get a short email from me?

1476
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:26,220
Would you enjoy getting a short email
from me every Friday that provides a

1477
01:39:26,221 --> 01:39:30,210
little morsel of fun before the weekend
and five bullet Friday is a very short

1478
01:39:30,211 --> 01:39:34,710
email where I share the coolest things
I've found or that I've been pondering

1479
01:39:34,711 --> 01:39:38,430
over the week. That could include
favorite new albums that I've discovered.

1480
01:39:38,431 --> 01:39:41,880
It could include Gizmos and gadgets
and all sorts of weird shit that I've

1481
01:39:41,881 --> 01:39:46,200
somehow dug up in the the
world of the esoteric as I do.

1482
01:39:46,470 --> 01:39:51,470
It could include favorite articles that
I've read and that I've shared with my

1483
01:39:52,111 --> 01:39:54,840
close friends for instance,
and it's very short.

1484
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:59,910
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness
before you head off for the weekend.

1485
01:39:59,970 --> 01:40:02,160
So if you want to receive that,
check it out.

1489
01:40:13,830 --> 01:40:18,150
This episode is brought to you by
wordpress.com I love work for us.

1490
01:40:18,720 --> 01:40:21,240
I have used it for so many years.

1491
01:40:21,241 --> 01:40:24,060
It's my goto five bump of
blogging and creating websites.

1492
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:28,110
I use wordpress.com for
everything every day. My site,

1493
01:40:28,170 --> 01:40:33,030
tim.blog is built on it. The website's
forum books to the tools of titans,

1494
01:40:33,031 --> 01:40:37,890
tribe of mentors, all in wordpress.com
and the founder Matt Mullenweg.

1495
01:40:38,010 --> 01:40:41,100
When my close friends has
appeared on this show, many times,

1496
01:40:41,160 --> 01:40:45,220
just search that moment like Tequila,
fairness for quite an exciting fun.

1497
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:49,890
Whether you're looking to create a
personal blog, a business site, both.

1498
01:40:50,010 --> 01:40:53,500
You make a really big impact right
out of the box when you built on

1499
01:40:53,501 --> 01:40:57,630
wordpress.com and you'll be in good
company. It's used to buy the New Yorker,

1500
01:40:57,640 --> 01:41:01,870
Jay Z, Beyonce at five 38
tech crunch, Ted CNN time,

1501
01:41:01,871 --> 01:41:03,640
just to name a handful,

1502
01:41:04,240 --> 01:41:07,870
and one of my friends at
Google shall remain nameless,

1503
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:13,200
has told me that wordpress.com offers
the best out of the box SEO imaginable,

1504
01:41:14,740 --> 01:41:19,740
and it's one of the many reasons that
nearly 30% of the Internet is run on best

1505
01:41:20,440 --> 01:41:23,940
you do not need experience or to hire
someone that's perhaps the best part.

1506
01:41:24,380 --> 01:41:26,680
wordpress.com guide you
through the entire experience.

1507
01:41:26,681 --> 01:41:31,540
They have hundreds of
designs and templates that
you can use and it's easy to

1508
01:41:31,541 --> 01:41:32,374
get started.

1509
01:41:32,500 --> 01:41:37,060
There's no need to worry about security
upgrade posting any of that debt for 24

1510
01:41:37,061 --> 01:41:39,940
seven support. And they're
very, very responsive.

1511
01:41:40,070 --> 01:41:41,590
You've questions they get right back to,

1512
01:41:41,950 --> 01:41:46,000
and this allows you to create the
highest quality with the least amount of

1513
01:41:46,001 --> 01:41:49,210
headache and friction. So if
you're building a website, period,

1514
01:41:49,560 --> 01:41:53,380
when my friends come to me and ask
what I use, what I recommend they use,

1515
01:41:53,710 --> 01:41:57,100
the answer is wordpress.com

This episode is brought to you by Peloton,

1522
01:42:20,350 --> 01:42:21,970
which I've been using
[inaudible] for about a year now.

1523
01:42:22,300 --> 01:42:26,260
Peloton is a cutting edge indoor cycling
bike that brings live studio classes

1524
01:42:26,261 --> 01:42:29,370
right into your home. You can also
do on demand, which is what I do.

1525
01:42:29,380 --> 01:42:33,130
We'll come back to that so you don't have
to worry about fitting classes into a

1526
01:42:33,131 --> 01:42:37,090
busy schedule or making it to a studio
or gym with a hectic or unpredictable

1527
01:42:37,091 --> 01:42:38,710
commute. I, for instance,

1528
01:42:38,740 --> 01:42:42,880
have a Peloton bike right in my master
bedroom at home and it's one of the first

1529
01:42:42,881 --> 01:42:46,570
things I do. Many mornings I
wake up, I meditate for a bit,

1530
01:42:46,930 --> 01:42:51,130
then I knock out a short 20 minute ride
in my undies. Hard to do that at the gym,

1531
01:42:51,400 --> 01:42:53,890
take a shower and I'm in higher
gear for the rest of the day.

1532
01:42:54,010 --> 01:42:57,690
It's really convenient and has become
something that I look forward to see.

1533
01:42:57,691 --> 01:42:59,860
You have a lot of options
for one if you'd like.

1534
01:42:59,861 --> 01:43:03,370
You can ride live with thousands of
other writers across the country on an

1535
01:43:03,371 --> 01:43:05,350
interactive leaderboard keeping motivated.

1536
01:43:05,680 --> 01:43:10,680
There are also up to 14 new classes added
everyday with more than 8,000 classes

1537
01:43:10,961 --> 01:43:15,910
on demand and you can pick
based on length, 45 minutes,
20 minutes, whatever music,

1538
01:43:15,911 --> 01:43:20,170
hip hop, rock and roll or save, low
impact versus high intensity or interval.

1539
01:43:20,520 --> 01:43:24,430
If you could pick the class structure
and style that works for you and in my

1540
01:43:24,431 --> 01:43:28,840
case I quite like Matt will produce and
I tend to do on demand and listen to a

1541
01:43:28,841 --> 01:43:31,840
lot of and watch many of the
same classes over and over.

1542
01:43:32,140 --> 01:43:34,720
But I'm kind of promiscuous and also
enjoy classes from a lot of the other

1543
01:43:34,721 --> 01:43:35,554
instructors.

1544
01:43:35,800 --> 01:43:39,850
They have Peloton and amazing roster of
incredible instructors in New York City

1545
01:43:40,040 --> 01:43:43,210
with a whole range of styles
and personalities so you
can find what you're in

1546
01:43:43,211 --> 01:43:44,044
the mood for it.

1547
01:43:44,110 --> 01:43:48,040
You also get real time metrics that you
can use to track your performance over

1548
01:43:48,041 --> 01:43:52,880
time. And that will help, I would say
catalyze you to beat your personal best.

1549
01:43:52,910 --> 01:43:55,940
Now that all sounds good, right?
Gamification, Yada, Yada, Yada.

1550
01:43:56,150 --> 01:44:00,200
I didn't think that it would work
for me or in any way incentivize me,

1551
01:44:00,201 --> 01:44:03,770
but they really 100% hit the
nail on the head. I was very,

1552
01:44:03,771 --> 01:44:08,771
very impressed with how motivating it
was and it worked tremendously to keep me

1553
01:44:09,381 --> 01:44:13,730
pushing, which quite honestly takes
a fair amount. I can get quite lazy,

1554
01:44:13,731 --> 01:44:16,310
particularly with anything
that edges on endurance,

1555
01:44:16,311 --> 01:44:20,570
which is kind of more than five reps
of anything for me. So check it out.
