1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,050
Hey guys,

2
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:06,050
I'm going to explain the podcast gear
that I use for both in person and remote

3
00:00:07,021 --> 00:00:12,021
interviews and the location right now
is the couch in my living room and this

4
00:00:14,191 --> 00:00:16,890
couch is where a lot of my
interviews have been recorded,

5
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:20,810
whether that's with Mike Rowe, Adam
Robinson, many, many others. Dave, Mario,

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,170
they typically sit here and then I sit
over here and then the gear sits where my

7
00:00:25,171 --> 00:00:28,110
acids right now,
and I'm going to show you a bunch of that.

8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,110
So there are many different
tools in the toolkit.

9
00:00:31,111 --> 00:00:34,440
This bag is a hunting bag,

10
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:39,300
which is a little small for hunting
and it's probably for fishing.

11
00:00:39,301 --> 00:00:44,301
It's a Cabela's bag and I decided to
use it as my studio in a bag effectively

12
00:00:46,411 --> 00:00:49,740
for podcasting. So I will travel with
this. I just came back from Austin,

13
00:00:49,741 --> 00:00:53,970
Texas where I had this and
was doing recording with
say Cheryl strayed and many,

14
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:54,410
many others.

15
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:59,410
So let's take a look inside
first we have extra SD cards,

16
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,410
very important. Always, always,

17
00:01:01,411 --> 00:01:06,411
always have several backup
SD cards because you will
end up having a tech issue

18
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,510
when you least want to have
a tech issue. First, Mike,

19
00:01:09,511 --> 00:01:14,190
I'm going to show you is a yellow tech
Mike. This one is a little quirky.

20
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:19,220
This is from a or the model I think is
ixm and this is very cool Mike because

21
00:01:20,341 --> 00:01:22,710
it's all encapsulated,

22
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,740
meaning you have the controls
for recording and so on
here for playback here and

23
00:01:29,071 --> 00:01:32,790
it records directly to
an SD card at the bottom.

24
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:38,150
So this particular mic is very
useful for any recording on the road.

25
00:01:38,151 --> 00:01:41,960
I've recorded intros. The welcome to the
Tim Ferriss show. My name is Tim Ferriss,

26
00:01:41,961 --> 00:01:46,920
Blah Blah Blah. At airports. I've
done it in airplane bathrooms,

27
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:51,000
not recommended for audio bounce,
but nonetheless very versatile.

28
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:56,001
I use this because it also automatically
levels what you record for many of my

29
00:01:57,181 --> 00:01:57,930
introductions,

30
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,630
even if I have access to the rest of the
gear that I'm going to show you because

31
00:02:00,631 --> 00:02:04,380
it's so easy to use and so fast.
So that's number one.

32
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:10,250
And you will notice for all of these
backup batteries and backup SD card.

33
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,870
Trust me on that.
You want both.

34
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,240
And since this will oftentimes go into
a backpack separate from this bag,

35
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,150
I have the backups in this itself.

36
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,480
Next we have the zoom.

37
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:29,570
So this isn't h six presume I used to
use the h four n which I still sometimes

38
00:02:30,121 --> 00:02:33,570
use, but it is more
primitive, easier to mess up.

39
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,500
And this is the basic piece
of equipment right here.

40
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,620
So the h six zoom is fantastic and
I upgraded for a host of reasons.

41
00:02:43,111 --> 00:02:43,561
Number one,

42
00:02:43,561 --> 00:02:48,480
the recording and a LCD
screen is much easier to use.

43
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,040
And next you have more ports
available for more people.

44
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:57,240
So the XLR cables, which I'll get
to in a second plug right in here,

45
00:02:57,241 --> 00:03:00,820
so I can very easily have four
people recording to this device.

46
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:04,510
And you can select which tracks
you won't use if you're recording,

47
00:03:04,511 --> 00:03:07,300
say music or something like that,
which I don't very often do.

48
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:12,420
You can attach different types
of extensions like these.

49
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,070
I very,
very rarely use those.

50
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:18,430
And that is the h six fantastic device.

51
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:23,431
I almost always use batteries as opposed
to an outlet because I never know if

52
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:28,690
I'm going to have access to an outlet.
So that is the h six.

53
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,770
Now how does this actually go together
with everything else? I'll show you

54
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,200
XLR cables. All right, so I
travel with many of these.

55
00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:43,201
The only times that I've had real issues
with impersonal recording has been due

56
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:46,680
to loose fittings on XLR cables.

57
00:03:46,681 --> 00:03:51,681
So you always want to travel with many
backups and these plug directly into the

58
00:03:53,861 --> 00:03:56,470
side here.
So like that.

59
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:00,850
And then the next piece of the puzzle.
And so you can see I have a lot of these.

60
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:04,660
Uh, the next piece of the
puzzle is the Mike that you use.

61
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:08,140
So there are different options.
Some people will use a lav mic,

62
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,880
so lovelier mic like this,

63
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:15,240
and that will connect directly
to an XLR cable of some time.

64
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:20,670
What I found for my guests
and for purposes of simplicity
is that I like a very,

65
00:04:22,391 --> 00:04:25,900
very simple Shure sm 58 stage Mike.

66
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:29,860
These are used by comedians.
They're used by, I'm sure, uh,

67
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:32,770
high school principals when they're
making announcements and auditoriums,

68
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,180
they are very,

69
00:04:34,181 --> 00:04:38,920
very hard to break and you want to make
sure that you get a wind cover, uh,

70
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:43,720
because you will otherwise have
problems with your peas and so on.

71
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,890
Uh, and sometimes ss, uh, if you don't
have something like this on the mic,

72
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,320
these are relatively cheap.
They're probably 60,

73
00:04:50,321 --> 00:04:55,321
70 bucks Max and you can buy them in
bulk and they simply connect to the other

74
00:04:56,261 --> 00:05:00,430
end and you're in business.
You can record. Okay,

75
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:05,530
so next up we have lots of backups.
Okay?

76
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:09,970
Lots and lots and lots of Mike's
can imagine how much fun this is.

77
00:05:09,971 --> 00:05:13,300
Taking a, a bag like this through Tsa. Uh,

78
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,910
there are constantly problems.

79
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:20,350
The next Mike I'm going to show you
is a little different. So this is,

80
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,600
this is the ATR 2100.
This is an audio Technica Mike.

81
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:30,910
And what makes this different
is not only does it have an Xlr,

82
00:05:30,911 --> 00:05:32,920
but also has a USB.

83
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:38,130
So I will use this when I'm recording
remotely and doing something via

84
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,810
telephone. I, he Skype.

85
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,370
So this connects via Usb to the computer
and then I'll set up this mic stand

86
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:49,000
next to the computer so
it fits in just like so.

87
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:53,380
And I'm off to the races. A few
important points. Number one,

88
00:05:53,381 --> 00:05:57,830
I use Skype and I use he cam call recorder
and there are many other options for

89
00:05:57,831 --> 00:06:02,270
recording I'm accustomed to. That works
fine for me. So that is what I use.

90
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,560
All their solutions allow you to record
local audio on the part of the person

91
00:06:08,391 --> 00:06:10,910
who is the interviewee.
What I have found,

92
00:06:10,911 --> 00:06:14,660
because I've been interviewed VSR software
before is it creates a burden for the

93
00:06:14,661 --> 00:06:18,110
person on the other end and if they
are say older or less tech savvy,

94
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:22,160
it creates more problems sometimes.
Okay, so there's a lot of tech,

95
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,390
it's obviously developing,

96
00:06:23,391 --> 00:06:28,220
but I use ECAMM call recorder
and I use this USB mic.

97
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:33,460
You want to split the recording so
that you have two different tracks,

98
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:37,310
two different wave files for both
yourself and the interviewee.

99
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,360
This is very important.

100
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:42,350
If someone is a low talker and let's say
you're a high talker or a loud talker,

101
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:46,220
you need to be able to adjust
those post production. All right,

102
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:50,720
so those are some of the basics that you
will find in this first compartment of

103
00:06:50,721 --> 00:06:54,260
the bag. And I'll cover just a few
more things and then we can move on.

104
00:06:54,261 --> 00:06:56,540
Number one, what's on this side? Well,

105
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:01,670
I have charging cables for Iphone,
which I have all over the place.

106
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:06,140
I have this, what does this looks
like a garbage bag. This is a Poncho.

107
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,930
If you get caught in the rain,
trust me,

108
00:07:08,931 --> 00:07:13,370
you do not want this bag getting wet
with all of this stuff. So this is just,

109
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,600
this is a Poncho that fits easily in my
head and we'll cover this and a backpack

110
00:07:17,601 --> 00:07:22,310
and everything else that I have on.
What are these batteries?

111
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:27,230
Every long interview you do use
new batteries seems wasteful,

112
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:31,130
but I promise you it's better than
losing half hour or an hour of audio.

113
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:36,460
Always have backup audio and
then we have a separate charger.

114
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:40,580
This is a charger and a
speaker if I want to use it.

115
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:45,320
But this is a backup
charger for my iPhone, uh,

116
00:07:45,321 --> 00:07:49,730
which I was sometimes in a pinch
use to record with an extension,

117
00:07:49,731 --> 00:07:50,600
which can be a,

118
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:55,650
a road or Shure microphone that
connects directly to lightening port.

119
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:59,180
All right? So you can, you can
really see that when in doubt,

120
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:03,080
have a backup as Jocko Willink did.

121
00:08:03,081 --> 00:08:05,630
His first public interview
on this podcast said,

122
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:10,820
and I've heard from other navy seals,
two is one and one is none.

123
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,400
That means have a backup cause fuel.
They have one of something.

124
00:08:13,401 --> 00:08:14,720
It's going to break or
you're going to lose it.

125
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:20,110
And then case in point we have more phone.
All right?

126
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,680
Just in case something goes wonky, and
this is going to seem odd, but trust me,

127
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:31,130
you want to have lots of extra headphones.
Seems like overkill.

128
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:33,710
But when you better to,

129
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:38,510
better to have and not need than to
need and not have. And on that point,

130
00:08:38,511 --> 00:08:42,620
guess what? I also have an
all of my bags to his brush.

131
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:45,920
You need an extra toothbrush because
you will find out when you have many

132
00:08:45,921 --> 00:08:48,860
different bags that you
will for whatever reason,

133
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,560
forget your Goddamn
toothbrush all the time. Uh,

134
00:08:51,561 --> 00:08:54,710
and then last I will show you
when I'm recording via phone,

135
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,300
there are a few ways that I keep track
of notes and prep for a given podcast.

136
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,650
If you're in person,

137
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:07,040
a lot of podcasters will advise that
you should record in person because it's

138
00:09:07,441 --> 00:09:09,690
better. There's a certain
designer, thick wa,

139
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:12,270
something that you get in person
that you don't get via the phone.

140
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,140
I actually disagree completely. I think
that if you are a novice podcast or,

141
00:09:16,141 --> 00:09:18,090
or even if you're a very experienced,

142
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,680
many of you will get better
results recording via Skype. Why?

143
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:26,410
Because when you're recording audio only,
uh,

144
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:29,940
you're able to put people more at ease.

145
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,850
In many cases you are
able to look at notes.

146
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:35,340
So not only can you look
at what you've prepared,

147
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:39,570
but you can Google things that you can
look up tangents that you want to explore.

148
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:43,620
You can write down things that you want
to explore later without distracting the

149
00:09:43,621 --> 00:09:46,890
interviewee. Very important. And
there are also a lot of people,

150
00:09:46,891 --> 00:09:50,250
even celebrities who when you hit
that record button in front of them,

151
00:09:50,251 --> 00:09:52,980
that red light comes on,
they turn into different people.

152
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:56,760
Either they shut down or they
go into their sound bites,
they're prepared script,

153
00:09:56,761 --> 00:09:57,594
whatever it might be.

154
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:02,750
So I really enjoy recording via Skype and
there are a number of tools that I use

155
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:06,320
to make it much more effective.
Uh,

156
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:09,750
so one of them is Evernote.

157
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:14,310
I use Evernote dozens of times
a day and have for years.

158
00:10:14,311 --> 00:10:15,090
Full disclosure,

159
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:18,510
I became an advisor to the company
in 2009 because I ended up using it.

160
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:22,560
I've used it for research related to
all of my books, but this is a sample.

161
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,910
This is a sample screen and I'm
not going to read all that to you,

162
00:10:26,911 --> 00:10:29,760
but this was for a Bj Miller who
is a palliative care physician.

163
00:10:29,761 --> 00:10:31,140
Hugely popular episode.

164
00:10:31,141 --> 00:10:35,610
Nobody really knew his name and he has
helped more than a thousand people to die

165
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,320
as a hospice physician. And at the
top I have how I was introduced.

166
00:10:40,321 --> 00:10:45,321
So via a partner at Ideo via Adam Gazzaley
who is a neuroscientist who's also

167
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:46,480
been on this podcast.

168
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,040
Then below that I just have small
prompts and accidental doctor,

169
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:52,190
which is something I read about him.
Why is he an accident?

170
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,460
The doctor Zen hospice.org.
Sophomore, Princeton Dinky. Okay.

171
00:10:56,461 --> 00:11:01,290
So this was a reference to his
accident which you had in college in

172
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:05,430
electrocution accident where he lost three
limbs. He's a triple, triple amputee.

173
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,390
So I'm wanting to talk about
that. Uh, photos from that time.

174
00:11:09,391 --> 00:11:12,480
I noticed he was always smiling,
so just says photos from that time.

175
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:17,700
Always smiling. How manage
question mark. All right. Uh,

176
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:22,600
and so on and so forth. Struggle as a
source of beauty, no pain, no joy. Uh,

177
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:24,270
and then questions,
TF.

178
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,030
These are just thoughts that occurred
to me as I'm taking these notes.

179
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:28,470
So struggles,
a source of beauty.

180
00:11:28,471 --> 00:11:31,980
That's a quote from him that I
wanted to dig into. Then after that,

181
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:36,420
so TF colon, how developed
more empathy, more compassion,

182
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:41,160
which is literally suffering together.
Practices, exercises, question mark. Okay.

183
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:44,910
So that is how I could refer to notes.
Looking at a screen,

184
00:11:44,911 --> 00:11:49,350
which is very difficult to do in person.
So I am a big fan of recording remotely,

185
00:11:49,351 --> 00:11:51,960
but now since I've done 200 plus episodes,

186
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,120
I feel comfortable
winging it more in person.

187
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,400
That doesn't make one
better than the other.

188
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:59,560
But if I want to connect with someone,

189
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,700
then perhaps I will try to do so in
person and then have a dinner afterwards,

190
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:07,330
say, or lunch beforehand, which is what I
did with Jocko. We had lunch beforehand,

191
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,860
then podcasts, then dinner together.
And we've since become good friends. Uh,

192
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:12,510
another thing.
