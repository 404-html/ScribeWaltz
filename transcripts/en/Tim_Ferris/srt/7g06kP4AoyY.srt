this episode is brought to you by
Athletic Greens. I get asked all the time,

24
00:01:34,231 --> 00:01:36,450
if you could only use one supplement,

25
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,330
And my answer is
inevitably Athletic Greens,

did not get paid for that and I
travel with it to avoid getting sick.

29
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,610
I take it in the mornings to

38
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:27,820
hello ladies and germs.

39
00:02:27,821 --> 00:02:30,880
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another
episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

40
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:34,930
each episode is my job to
deconstruct world class performers,

41
00:02:34,931 --> 00:02:39,100
to tease out the habits,
routines, morning rituals,

42
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:43,420
favorite books, etc. That have made
them spectacularly good at what they do.

43
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:47,080
And there are patterns that
you notice across disciplines.

44
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:51,610
That is why I interview people from a
very broad spectrum of areas like the

45
00:02:51,611 --> 00:02:54,850
military, entertainment, chest,
sports, comedy, et Cetera.

46
00:02:54,851 --> 00:02:58,570
So it ranges from Arnold Schwarzenegger
to General Stanley McChrystal.

47
00:02:58,571 --> 00:03:02,290
And in this episode we have a dynamic duo.

48
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:05,740
We have Seth Rogen at
Seth Rogen, R, O, g, e,

49
00:03:05,741 --> 00:03:10,240
n who is an actor, writer, producer,
and director and his partner in crime,

50
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:14,920
Evan Goldberg at Evan
Goldberg on the twitters,

51
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:18,220
who is a Canadian director,
screenwriter and producer. Together,

52
00:03:18,221 --> 00:03:21,470
they get into a whole lot of mischief
and create some amazing comedy,

53
00:03:21,471 --> 00:03:25,180
and I had a chance to spend some time
with both of these great gents as well as

54
00:03:25,181 --> 00:03:25,960
their team,

55
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,530
which is spectacular and I won't mention
the location in case they're keeping

56
00:03:29,531 --> 00:03:31,690
that quiet,
but here's some background.

57
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,090
They've collaborated on
films such as Super Bad,

58
00:03:34,091 --> 00:03:36,970
which they actually first
conceived of as teenagers,

59
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,930
knocked up pineapple express,
the Green Hornet and funny people.

60
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:44,740
They've also written for the
Ali g show and the Simpsons.

61
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:49,090
In 2013 evidence,
Seth released their directorial debut.

62
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,410
This is the end,

63
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:53,680
which was actually a combination of two
different ideas and we get into that in

64
00:03:53,681 --> 00:03:58,570
the conversation in 2014 set to start in
and produced alongside Evan neighbors,

65
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:02,590
which was a worldwide comedy hit and
has taken in more than 268 million

66
00:04:02,591 --> 00:04:07,591
worldwide and then appearing in
the news yet again in December,

67
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,270
2014 Rogan and Goldberg's film,

68
00:04:10,271 --> 00:04:14,470
the interview became easily the most
talked about news story around the world

69
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:18,700
and that was not just in the
entertainment mags but in every different

70
00:04:18,701 --> 00:04:21,400
publication because of many reasons.

71
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,890
So under extremely
difficult circumstances.

72
00:04:23,891 --> 00:04:26,440
The film persevered to become
Sony Pictures, number one,

73
00:04:26,441 --> 00:04:30,340
digital title of all time neighbors
too is shooting right now and will be

74
00:04:30,341 --> 00:04:34,660
released next May. Seth and Evan are
also in production on sausage party,

75
00:04:34,661 --> 00:04:37,510
which I saw a clip of a prelim clip,

76
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,000
which is a Raunchy animated movie
for adults about one sausage,

77
00:04:41,001 --> 00:04:45,040
his quest to discover the truth about
his existence and I really hope to God

78
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:48,610
that some of the Raunchy or scenes make
it end because they will make your head

79
00:04:48,611 --> 00:04:49,270
explode.

80
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:53,530
Seth and Evan are producing that film
with Megan Ellison and Conrad Vernon.

81
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,410
In our conversation,
the one you're about to listen to,

82
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,000
we discuss all manner of tactics and
silliness, including Kule, Cushing,

83
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:04,390
karate,
it's God empty hand and uh,

84
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:08,740
how they participated in that writer's
block and related debates. Does it exist?

85
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:13,360
Does not exist. How do you contend
with it if it does writing process? Uh,

86
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:17,290
I ask questions like, who are the most
underrated comedians and comedy writers?

87
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:21,580
What is the odd book that Judd
Apatow recommended to them,

88
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,680
which happens to also be
woody Allen's favorite.

89
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:27,670
How super bad got made after
the first drafted around age 13.

90
00:05:27,671 --> 00:05:29,440
How kids in the hall influenced them,
the movie,

91
00:05:29,441 --> 00:05:32,290
they both wish they'd
written common pot mistakes.

92
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:35,890
So if you're just listening to
this for a marijuana playbook,

93
00:05:35,891 --> 00:05:38,020
well there might be something
in here for you as well.

94
00:05:38,021 --> 00:05:42,880
So recommended newb pot for
working versus relaxing and much,

95
00:05:42,881 --> 00:05:46,180
much more. So I really hope
you enjoy this. As always,

Oven. Seth, look to the show.
Thank you. Thanks for having us.

108
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,720
I appreciate you guys taking the time,
especially in this very busy,

109
00:06:29,721 --> 00:06:32,540
busy month that you gents have.
And a,

110
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:36,470
I thought we could start with a story
that we had discussed a little bit,

111
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:39,920
Evan in the car, which was
Kilkee shit. So tell me about

112
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:40,891
karate.

113
00:06:40,891 --> 00:06:45,510
He goes [inaudible] we're
talking about when we were kids,

114
00:06:45,511 --> 00:06:48,530
how uh,
how we behaved and how I was a softie.

115
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,350
And so I did rugby and karate to cut,
try and toughen myself up.

116
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,360
And I joined at the
Jewish community center,

117
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,860
which is one of the places that we
became really good friends. He said,

118
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,590
had been doing it a few years before me.

119
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:01,220
We'd already met him Bar Mitzvah class
and our parents were like a Jewish

120
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:03,920
community center that can't be much,
you know,

121
00:07:03,921 --> 00:07:07,280
just simple karate and they let
us beat the living shit out of.

122
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,460
It was pretty, uh, I realize like we were,

123
00:07:10,461 --> 00:07:14,660
the bad guys from karate
kid were a Cobra Kai. Yeah.

124
00:07:14,661 --> 00:07:17,330
Like we were banned from
tournament and from tournaments.

125
00:07:17,331 --> 00:07:21,050
And then we finally went to a tournament
and I realized that like the way they

126
00:07:21,051 --> 00:07:24,170
taught us to fight like was not
conducive to tournament fighting.

127
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:29,110
And I punched the guy in the throat
and got disqualified from tournament

128
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,140
basically. And I didn't know that that
wasn't like what you were supposed to do.

129
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,131
I was just like,
oh,

130
00:07:34,131 --> 00:07:37,340
he's supposed to beat the shit
out of this condition to respond.

131
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:41,720
I have a memory of one time where they
made me fight that like 35 year old and

132
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:46,400
when I was 14 and she liked choked me out
on the ground until I pass though this

133
00:07:46,401 --> 00:07:50,690
was in class. I remember
fighting like full grown men too.

134
00:07:50,691 --> 00:07:54,200
I remember hitting that guy rod so hard.

135
00:07:54,201 --> 00:07:56,420
I rod was like a 280 pounds,

136
00:07:56,421 --> 00:08:01,421
six foot three guy and he was like 1,440
and I hit him so hard in the face with

137
00:08:01,521 --> 00:08:06,200
like a spinning backhand that he knocked
him in, like almost knocked him out.

138
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,580
It like dazed him completely
and then they let me,

139
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:12,710
they look clean,
let him fight me again.

140
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:16,460
Did he like punched me in the
mouth so hard? I like couldn't. Uh,

141
00:08:16,461 --> 00:08:19,550
I couldn't like I think my mouth started
bleeding and then I heard and then,

142
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:24,580
but there's so many stories
that are flooding of the
day that ended it all where

143
00:08:25,311 --> 00:08:28,940
I got kicked in the hip by a 40 year
old black belt who fractured my hip.

144
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:33,050
And then he backed up into a pillar and
got a piece of wood lodged in his foot

145
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,560
and thus ended RQ cause,

146
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:38,690
but I remember fighting with
teacher on the ground one time,

147
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:43,720
like the teacher Sean with like I
remember like grappling on the ground with

148
00:08:43,821 --> 00:08:47,300
him. Ed like to the point where he
would just like do anything you can't.

149
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,770
And I was like trying to bite him.

150
00:08:48,771 --> 00:08:53,690
I was like spitting on him and like that
was like what you were supposed to do

151
00:08:53,691 --> 00:08:58,470
in the class. One time you did it, you
would get in trouble and he'd be like,

152
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:00,750
you could do more.
Like it wasn't time.

153
00:09:00,751 --> 00:09:05,751
I spat in his face and then he took
the spit and the exact same thing,

154
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:08,730
exact same thing to me.

155
00:09:08,731 --> 00:09:12,750
And we thought it was like this is what
[inaudible] Jewish community center

156
00:09:12,751 --> 00:09:17,370
karate is. So you mentioned Gilks in,
you're like, I don't think, you know,

157
00:09:17,371 --> 00:09:20,820
people get the wrong image when I tell
them karate and I from having lived in

158
00:09:20,821 --> 00:09:24,530
Japan for a year as an exchange student
is first time I got exposed to kill Shin.

159
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,540
And those were like the bad boys of the
karate world. It was a very well known,

160
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:31,020
like you don't want to get the
leg kicks are very famous dude.

161
00:09:31,021 --> 00:09:34,850
One time I got there,
the dentist, there's like

162
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,630
grown men.
This was child abuse.

163
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:45,510
Like this guy had the log gets legs and
be entirely these little brown slippers

164
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:47,610
and I uh,

165
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:52,050
and he just like kept kicking my legs
out from under me relentlessly and there

166
00:09:52,051 --> 00:09:54,150
was nothing I can, he
may stop it. All of us,

167
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,750
they made all of us watch as he
did it to him for like, yeah,

168
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:01,770
just like I would get up putting it like
try to fight again and he would just

169
00:10:01,771 --> 00:10:04,080
like smack my legs out from under me.
And just like,

170
00:10:04,081 --> 00:10:07,080
I remember just hitting the ground.
There was this one guy,

171
00:10:07,081 --> 00:10:08,610
the guy who ended up fracturing my hip,

172
00:10:08,611 --> 00:10:12,600
which ruined my rugby and karate actually
in your hip is not a small hairline

173
00:10:12,601 --> 00:10:13,800
fracture.
It wasn't terrible,

174
00:10:13,801 --> 00:10:16,530
but it's enough that I couldn't
run and stuff like that. Uh,

175
00:10:16,531 --> 00:10:19,020
Malcolm and he would do
this thing to this day.

176
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:21,690
I can't comprehend how he did it in
a movie. You wouldn't believe it.

177
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,060
He literally like casually
put both hands behind.

178
00:10:24,061 --> 00:10:28,950
His back in a small room was try and
hit me and I couldn't and I'm like 15,

179
00:10:28,951 --> 00:10:30,240
16 real fit.

180
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,570
I've been doing karate for like five
years and I couldn't even touch him.

181
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:38,070
I remember Malcolm kicked me in the
eye once so hard that my parents,

182
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:42,330
I had to call their family friends who
were eye doctors and take me to their

183
00:10:42,331 --> 00:10:47,070
house after the karate class cause I like
couldn't see out of one of my eyes for

184
00:10:47,071 --> 00:10:51,060
like three hours. But I regret nothing.
I regret nothing either. It's weird.

185
00:10:51,061 --> 00:10:54,720
It's weird down cause I'm so I thought
it was always like not a violent person

186
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:58,530
but I'm not competitive and I don't like
care about any of that stuff that much.

187
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:59,383
So it did it,

188
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:04,350
did it turn you guys off of that
type of thing sort of indefinitely?

189
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:09,510
How that point or certainly as somebody
who has like Tmj and like has had some

190
00:11:09,511 --> 00:11:12,870
joint issues,
I can identify that that is too brutal.

191
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:17,100
Like their knuckles were all puffed up
and because we would break boards and if

192
00:11:17,101 --> 00:11:19,620
you didn't break the board you
had to try it again. I'm like,

193
00:11:19,621 --> 00:11:22,210
can I split a knuckle into
sounds like a liability.

194
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:26,410
It's weird because it was happening
to get the Jewish community center and

195
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:29,820
that's what's so strange about it.
And then rent like it had,

196
00:11:29,821 --> 00:11:32,850
I don't think any of our parents by
parents would come and watch some time,

197
00:11:32,851 --> 00:11:35,190
but they thought, I guess I hope
to get to 100 frame of reference.

198
00:11:35,191 --> 00:11:36,300
Maybe something just felt like,
oh,

199
00:11:36,301 --> 00:11:41,190
that's what crummy classes because he
just picked me up and like not comment

200
00:11:41,191 --> 00:11:42,290
that I was bleeding from.

201
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:46,140
My parents would come sometimes cause I
started when I was younger so they like

202
00:11:46,141 --> 00:11:50,830
knew I did it for like over getting for
10 years or something like [inaudible]

203
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,040
seven and you did it three? Yeah,
I think I started, we did it

204
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,200
with our buddy,
uh,

205
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:58,900
Fogle and our buddy Corbyn or buddy
Glassberg and they would just make us as

206
00:11:58,901 --> 00:12:03,190
friends, beat the shit out of each
other. It was pretty, Glassberg was soft.

207
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:06,190
He was there.
He got to play the younger guys,

208
00:12:06,191 --> 00:12:07,600
which made them probably feel pretty good.

209
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:13,660
When did you guys first meet?
I mean first encounter each other?

210
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,310
Uh, it was, I was going to,

211
00:12:15,311 --> 00:12:18,280
I went to like two hours of
afterschool Hebrew school Tuesday,

212
00:12:18,281 --> 00:12:22,570
Thursday and he went to like a half
Hebrew school, half normal school.

213
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,210
He was a pretty much like,
it was like a Hebrew school.

214
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:26,290
It was like they did
half and half studies,

215
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:29,050
but it was like full on
like Jewish elements.

216
00:12:29,051 --> 00:12:33,190
And he would get out when I would go in
and I took the class at the synagogue,

217
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,980
which was beside his school. Right.
So we would see each other for years.

218
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,060
We didn't really know each other,

219
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:40,510
but we would see each other and I was
kinda like the loudest person from this

220
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:44,800
side and he was friends with full
role. Uh, I became, well yet this guy,

221
00:12:44,801 --> 00:12:47,010
Sammy Fogel,
who is the [inaudible] of super bad,

222
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:50,430
but he's not really that big of
a loser. We just met him. Uh,

223
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:54,010
he and I became good friends and sets
mother and his mother were good friends

224
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,470
and then it all kind of
culminated to bar Mitzvah class.

225
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,110
We all took Sunday morning,
what was it called?

226
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,560
Post to fill holes and to fill in class
where they would give us chocolate milk

227
00:13:02,561 --> 00:13:06,510
and bagels to lure us to learn how to do
our bar Mitzvah portion is departments

228
00:13:06,511 --> 00:13:11,260
for class if you gave me,
yeah, I know it's a weird
mix, but it's delicious and a,

229
00:13:11,261 --> 00:13:14,500
and we just kind of met there and
because of Fogel we became friends. Yeah.

230
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:18,940
And when did you guys start
collaborating creatively?

231
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:24,190
In hindsight, like eight months later.
How old were you guys? Around? 13, 12,

232
00:13:24,191 --> 00:13:27,010
13. It was literally, it's not
like we pretend we don't remember.

233
00:13:27,011 --> 00:13:27,641
We don't remember,

234
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:30,520
but we were watching some crappy movie
and we just looked at each other and

235
00:13:30,521 --> 00:13:32,320
we're like, we could write a better
movie. And then there's like a pause.

236
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:33,880
It's like we should write a better mood.

237
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:36,760
And I think I would use stand
up already at that point.

238
00:13:36,761 --> 00:13:39,550
And so like there was
some context for like,

239
00:13:39,551 --> 00:13:43,420
we can write things and they'll become
things like I was already like writing

240
00:13:43,421 --> 00:13:47,560
things and then performing
them. So, um, it wasn't,

241
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:51,460
it wasn't just like two, like we
actually like wanted to make a movie,

242
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,100
like it wasn't him. And then
I'd already seen like, oh,

243
00:13:54,101 --> 00:13:58,110
you can tangibly like do something.
And a lot of people, uh, you know,

244
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:01,270
I call you came all the way from
Canada and, and, and it's not like,

245
00:14:01,271 --> 00:14:04,930
like Vancouver is a movie town
going to movies at our high school,

246
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,280
like almost anyone that we
know in America is from.

247
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:14,310
And they all think we're like bumpkins
real city where they made tons of movies.

248
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:18,370
And so you would see movie sets everywhere
growing up. And our high school,

249
00:14:18,371 --> 00:14:21,690
they shot a lot of movies and Diamond
Phillips Movie Masterminds starring

250
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:26,020
Patrick Stewart and Vincent, Carl
Pfizer. Uh, it's not a fantastic movie,

251
00:14:26,021 --> 00:14:28,340
but it was shot at our
high school. And, um,

252
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:33,790
and so you would see it around. And
so it was like, it was Kinda like, no,

253
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:37,540
we didn't know anyone in the business or
anything like that or who was involved

254
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:42,370
in movies. But, um, it was just
like around, and so you kind of,

255
00:14:42,371 --> 00:14:45,380
my first interaction with our friend
Amelia Wasserman's mother, uh,

256
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,560
produced like kiddish
kids shows and she like,

257
00:14:47,561 --> 00:14:51,360
let me try to write some kids episodes
and gave me some point and I think Julia

258
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,950
Martinez, his dad, like produce TV shows
or something like that. I can't remember.

259
00:14:54,951 --> 00:14:58,720
Like, we knew people whose parents
had like kind of like, you know, uh,

260
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:02,050
jobs and like it was around,
it was just kind of around

261
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,180
this girl I dated Abby Salzburg.

262
00:15:05,181 --> 00:15:08,870
Her mother was a writer for the newspaper
and she kind of gave me some pointers

263
00:15:08,871 --> 00:15:12,410
and helped me out. So we had like some
help, but we didn't really have a hard in.

264
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:17,240
I think one of my distant, distant
cousins was a producer on passenger 57.

265
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:18,740
The Wesley Snipes.

266
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,240
Yeah,
I that I remember hearing as a child,

267
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,450
it's really fascinating that you say
you're given the opportunity to kind of

268
00:15:25,451 --> 00:15:29,290
tinker in the writing perspective
with, uh, with these episodes.

269
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:31,960
When I grew up next to the,
uh,

270
00:15:31,961 --> 00:15:35,130
the gent who created the choose your
own adventure book series. What's, yeah,

271
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:39,280
that's awesome. So we had my brother and
I had chances to test drive his books,

272
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:44,920
provide feedback, and this is a
bad choice. He gave him feedback,

273
00:15:44,921 --> 00:15:48,910
ended up using, he would put our names
into the books. If you go back there,

274
00:15:48,911 --> 00:15:53,790
a handful of books,
books and yeah, that was,

275
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:56,350
they were a power couple of his
friends was walking through the woods.

276
00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:01,730
[inaudible] he was warning
the mountains are dangerous.

277
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:10,600
And you guys, is it true that you started
working on super bad around that time?

278
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:13,090
And we started writing.
We sat down

279
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:16,580
and started that. That was the first
thing we ever tried to do was writing.

280
00:16:16,581 --> 00:16:19,580
She was writing Superman and it was,
it was terrible at first,

281
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:24,050
but it was really bad at first.
But, um, but that being said,

282
00:16:24,051 --> 00:16:27,980
we liked movies so much and we're so
into movies that like looking back,

283
00:16:27,981 --> 00:16:32,981
we kind of instinctually like understood
the vague structure of movies in like a

284
00:16:33,141 --> 00:16:35,690
pretty instinctual way.

285
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:40,730
And like we loved bad movies, which I
think actually was extremely beneficial.

286
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,140
What not to do.

287
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,790
Tons of B movie was this place called
Video Matika. Is that what it's called?

288
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:49,460
There were seven movies for $7
for seven days. It was correct.

289
00:16:49,461 --> 00:16:53,030
And we would go and do that and
watch them all. And it was, you know,

290
00:16:53,031 --> 00:16:54,590
get like two good movies in five crappy.

291
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:59,620
But then around this time was when movies
like pulp fiction and clerks and like

292
00:17:00,261 --> 00:17:03,650
that, like, like a Rushmore
and a bottle rocket.

293
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:08,180
Like it was kind of like the dawn
of like nineties independent cinema.

294
00:17:08,181 --> 00:17:12,080
And we were really, really
into those movies too. And
again, a lot of those movies,

295
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:16,060
you know, uh, at least
in theory had to care.

296
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:19,490
And the myth had kind of
like a do it yourself feel.

297
00:17:19,491 --> 00:17:22,940
We're like Kevin Smith
just make clerks clearly.

298
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:25,520
Like they just got a camera and just
made a bunch of friends were like,

299
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:30,340
let's fucking do this. Did. And that
was very like inspirational to us, uh,

300
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:33,820
because it just seemed very
achievable, you know? Um,

301
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:37,520
and so I think that's one of the
reasons we again started doing it.

302
00:17:37,521 --> 00:17:39,980
It was just like, we're like,
it was about high school kids.

303
00:17:39,981 --> 00:17:42,200
We knew high school kids,
I want it to be an actor.

304
00:17:42,201 --> 00:17:45,110
We knew there was other kids in our
school who were trying to be actors and

305
00:17:45,111 --> 00:17:48,020
stuff like that.
And so it just kind of seemed like we,

306
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:49,950
like if we write a high school movie,

307
00:17:49,951 --> 00:17:53,700
we could make a high school
movie basically. Yeah. And
he had his standup start.

308
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,370
And uh, for me it was like,
when I was like five years old,

309
00:17:56,371 --> 00:17:58,140
if he asked me what I wanted
to do was be a writer,

310
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,490
I always want it to be a writer.

311
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,670
They actually tried to send
me to a psychiatrist in
elementary school because I

312
00:18:02,671 --> 00:18:05,310
would write like dark stuff.
Cause my Hebrew school,

313
00:18:05,311 --> 00:18:08,730
I learned about the Holocaust and I kept
writing about the Holocaust and they

314
00:18:08,731 --> 00:18:09,750
thought there was something wrong with me.

315
00:18:09,751 --> 00:18:13,320
But I remember we met when he was like
the first person I ever met who like

316
00:18:13,321 --> 00:18:15,680
wrote recreationally other than me.

317
00:18:15,681 --> 00:18:18,900
Like I wrote stand up and he wrote
like stories and stuff like that.

318
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:22,080
And I remember like when
you're like a 13 year old kids

319
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,710
eat a lot of other 13
year old kid who's like,

320
00:18:25,711 --> 00:18:29,820
what are their hobbies is writing
recreationally. It's not that common.

321
00:18:29,821 --> 00:18:32,360
And so he kind of made me realize
what the standup, he was like,

322
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:36,830
like he just did it. And so we both
were like, what if we just did this? Uh,

323
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,890
no one at this age is trying to do it. So
if we get a jump on it, maybe we'll do.

324
00:18:40,891 --> 00:18:44,880
Okay. And also it seems like the
easiest path to becoming a writer.

325
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,630
Like I tried to write a novel once
and I failed. It is really hot.

326
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:52,840
Those are hard. Yeah. And you just funny
you mentioned the school psychologist.

327
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:55,780
So I was sent to the school psychologist.
Also everyone in this room,

328
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:56,813
I was for sure

329
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,600
the writing assignments
I didn't want to do.

330
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:03,360
And so thematically I would turn them
into stories about serial killers.

331
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,520
I think it's a common reaction,

332
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:12,390
dystopian future story about a bunch of
kids trying to get out of a Nazi control

333
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:16,900
future. And it ended with all of them
dying. You invented the young adult novel,

334
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:23,320
you invented divergent
and the hunger games.

335
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:26,240
The reason they tried to send me
to drink is because I drew the

336
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,290
picture of all their

337
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,550
ups is at the end.
That's a,

338
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:32,270
that's a nice touch for those people
who wouldn't take the time to read it.

339
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,330
You've got to really spell it out.
So what was,

340
00:19:35,331 --> 00:19:38,750
what was the difference before you set
then in the early days, uh, between,

341
00:19:38,751 --> 00:19:41,150
what were the biggest differences
between writing for standup?

342
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:45,920
And this can be contemporary like in
general and writing for film for instance.

343
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,840
Um,
I,

344
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:52,440
I've thought about it a lot and when we
started writing movies I honestly like,

345
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:53,910
and,
and when we started doing it more,

346
00:19:53,911 --> 00:19:58,911
I kind of became less
interested in writing stand
up in some ways because like,

347
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,700
and I honestly think that good stand up,

348
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:07,170
I wasn't the best stand up comedian is one
thing. Like I would, I was pretty good.

349
00:20:07,171 --> 00:20:10,560
I was like a B plus standup comedian,
a minus.

350
00:20:10,561 --> 00:20:14,160
I wasn't like an a plus 10 and comedian
and I'm not saying that we're like the

351
00:20:14,161 --> 00:20:15,420
best script writers in the world,

352
00:20:15,421 --> 00:20:18,720
but we've achieved a plus
moments I think here and there.

353
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:23,280
And so that, that was one of the
things I was just like aware of.

354
00:20:23,281 --> 00:20:25,530
I would just like watch other
people do it and be like, wow,

355
00:20:25,531 --> 00:20:29,930
this guy's like doing something like that.
I like here, they're just better at it,

356
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:35,040
you know? And when we started writing
movies, I started to feel like, oh,

357
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:36,330
like we act like this.

358
00:20:36,331 --> 00:20:40,740
I feel like we could maybe again like
really carve out our own niche doing,

359
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:43,200
which I didn't feel like I was
particularly doing, doing standup.

360
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:47,830
I was young and that was at first and
each is like I would write about my young

361
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:51,910
person's experience,
but then as I got older I found like,

362
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:55,330
I don't know as a standup I was
struggling a little bit to find a unique

363
00:20:55,331 --> 00:20:59,950
perspective. I have a theory you
cease to be tortured. Yeah, exactly.

364
00:20:59,951 --> 00:21:02,710
That was part of it. I was like
really tortured when I was, I mean,

365
00:21:02,711 --> 00:21:06,910
I mean I wasn't that not really tortured
like you know, young neuro seasoning.

366
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:10,450
I'll stand standup
comics function largely.

367
00:21:10,451 --> 00:21:15,190
Not all of them but a lot of them on
anxiety. Like self obsessed that much.

368
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:18,940
Yeah. I don't find myself
that interesting. Honestly.

369
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:23,080
One of the other things is like I,
and I think writing,

370
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:26,320
and that's one of the reasons
I think writing movies was,

371
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:31,470
was better is because I was writing other
people and I also struggled with stand

372
00:21:31,701 --> 00:21:34,930
up is that you could only really,
and again good standups do this,

373
00:21:34,931 --> 00:21:38,950
but I couldn't find a way to do it is
like I can only talk from one perspective

374
00:21:38,951 --> 00:21:39,521
in Standup,

375
00:21:39,521 --> 00:21:43,870
but in a movie you can write two or
three or four or five or six perspectives

376
00:21:43,871 --> 00:21:48,760
all in one scene. You could have five
guys arguing there about how to, you know,

377
00:21:48,761 --> 00:21:51,700
turn it, you know, how to
do anything, what's the best
way to get out of this room,

378
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:56,260
you know, and to, and as we
started writing, like, you know,

379
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:59,350
some of the best scenes that we've
ever achieved are literally just people

380
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:00,490
screaming at each other.

381
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:05,700
And so like I think that was something
that I thought was very funny that we

382
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:07,810
were good at was like conflict.

383
00:22:07,811 --> 00:22:12,811
And it's hard to have like
conflict in stand up comedy for me,

384
00:22:13,091 --> 00:22:14,410
I couldn't find a way to do it.

385
00:22:14,411 --> 00:22:17,200
Other people do it and they tell
stories that involve conflict.

386
00:22:17,201 --> 00:22:19,690
And the whole thing is about,
you know, the struggle.

387
00:22:19,691 --> 00:22:23,020
And I look at it now and sometimes I
think like, man, if I kept doing it,

388
00:22:23,021 --> 00:22:27,430
I maybe would have broken
through a wall. But, um, I just,

389
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:31,890
I dunno. And I loved movies. That was
the other thing is just like, and I,

390
00:22:31,891 --> 00:22:34,390
I loved movies also,
but I was a bit more of a comic nerd.

391
00:22:34,391 --> 00:22:38,220
He was a comic nerd too, but I was like
extreme comic meaning comic book. Yeah.

392
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:42,700
My brother is a natural speed reader.
He reads it at a remarkable pace.

393
00:22:42,701 --> 00:22:45,610
He can read a book in a day, like a
400 page book, just burn through it.

394
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:49,660
So he would read comics and mountains of
them would form and then he would draw

395
00:22:49,661 --> 00:22:52,930
them. So I would mimic him cause he was
two years older and I would read all the

396
00:22:52,931 --> 00:22:55,930
comics he read and then try to draw
like him. He's actually an expert.

397
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:58,690
He's a very good artist.
He drew all the penises for Superbad.

398
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:03,440
[inaudible]
make a cameo in the big Lebowski

399
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:08,360
and he's a lawyer now. But, uh,

400
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:10,610
I tried to like mimic
him with that stuff and,

401
00:23:10,611 --> 00:23:13,740
and comics are just movie
storyboards there isn't mad again.

402
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:15,550
And I read all the comic books too.
I think that's it.

403
00:23:15,551 --> 00:23:19,240
I mean it's like we connected
heavily over Calvin and Hobbes. Yeah.

404
00:23:19,241 --> 00:23:22,350
We love artists of all time.
The sarcasm of it,

405
00:23:22,351 --> 00:23:27,250
like forged our own genius. But I
think we just liked like the cinematic,

406
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:32,230
like again, comics and like it just seemed
appealing. Um, and again, I think, yeah,

407
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,970
and it's funny that at the time,
like,

408
00:23:33,971 --> 00:23:37,750
like if you look at what we've done
recently, like we like grandiose things,

409
00:23:37,751 --> 00:23:40,930
we like big things to happen,
end of the world scenarios and all that.

410
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:44,830
But at the time, all we knew was
that we really wanted to get laid.

411
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:47,630
We weren't getting laid
and we weren't super cool.

412
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,980
And I think the reason Superbad worked
out is it's rare that you are the thing

413
00:23:51,981 --> 00:23:55,820
you're writing on at the moment. You're
doing it and you're self aware of it.

414
00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:00,200
And we're still, I mean,
and that's something that
we've continued to try to do,

415
00:24:00,201 --> 00:24:03,140
honestly. I mean neighbors, you
know, it was a very good example.

416
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:03,921
All my friends are having,

417
00:24:03,921 --> 00:24:07,250
our friends are having kids or trying
to have kids and are married and her

418
00:24:07,251 --> 00:24:10,120
getting older and are moving
into different places. And like,

419
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:13,490
I don't have a kid and I want to go out
and I call all my friends and none of

420
00:24:13,491 --> 00:24:18,190
them can that they had. So
I think from the get go, um,

421
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,780
and that's something that
came from stand up comedy.

422
00:24:20,781 --> 00:24:25,700
Like there's a comic named Darryl Lennox
who still performs, um, who is great.

423
00:24:25,701 --> 00:24:30,410
And He, the comics were very nice to
me, which is in retrospect, insane.

424
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:34,970
Cause I would not be nice to like a 13
year old kid who was doing standup comedy.

425
00:24:34,971 --> 00:24:38,150
I don't think. Maybe I would,
but I don't assume I would.

426
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:41,780
But I remember he saw me perform
and I used to have like jokes.

427
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:44,540
I would try to like mimic other
comedians like Steven writers, Seinfeld,

428
00:24:44,541 --> 00:24:48,230
like what's the deal with crazy glue?
And he was like, he was like, dude,

429
00:24:48,231 --> 00:24:50,270
you're like the only 14 year old.
He's like,

430
00:24:50,271 --> 00:24:53,000
you're the only person here who could
like talk about trying to get like a hand

431
00:24:53,001 --> 00:24:56,560
job for the first time.
Talk about that. Like,

432
00:24:56,630 --> 00:25:01,220
that is like so much more interesting
than anything you're talking about. Like,

433
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:04,040
why are you just talking about that?
And I was like, oh, you're right.

434
00:25:04,041 --> 00:25:05,810
That's actually a very
good way of doing it.

435
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:08,570
And then that kind of
carried through everything.

436
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:12,000
Yeah. And uh, it, it's, it's, um,

437
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,750
I've been really fascinated just sort
of observing you guys work and, uh,

438
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,870
you know,
realizing that at least for me,

439
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:22,410
when you get started super
bad at a time when those, uh,

440
00:25:22,411 --> 00:25:25,410
all those feelings were very kind
of ever present in your lives.

441
00:25:25,411 --> 00:25:28,020
And when I look back and say, pass
books, people have asked me like,

442
00:25:28,021 --> 00:25:29,250
what would you edit?
What would you change?

443
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:32,040
And I don't want to touch it because
I feel like it was written at a very

444
00:25:32,041 --> 00:25:36,090
precise point in time related to very
specific pains that I might not be

445
00:25:36,091 --> 00:25:40,360
experiencing now because it's a, you
know, the chapters passed on. What, uh,

446
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,570
what does your writing
process look like now?

447
00:25:42,571 --> 00:25:46,720
A lot of people have asked me to ask you
both this, uh, but what is just from the,

448
00:25:46,721 --> 00:25:50,910
the very first sort of
concept stages? Well, uh,

449
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,050
as I was telling you earlier,
it's changed a little.

450
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:58,300
We just did this project preacher with
a guy named Sam Catlin chasing bad and,

451
00:25:58,301 --> 00:26:01,740
and we used to immediately
start like kind of we,

452
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:05,840
we would always write down ideas and he
taught us this new trick of not writing

453
00:26:05,841 --> 00:26:08,210
down ideas for a good month and just talk,

454
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:11,600
shooting it around and talking and talking
and talking. And I kept saying, look,

455
00:26:11,601 --> 00:26:14,750
now we're going to write.
Right? And he was like, no,
no, no. We just keep talking.

456
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:16,850
And that's a new trick
that I think was great.

457
00:26:16,851 --> 00:26:19,040
Just spend way more time
talking to you about it.

458
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:21,820
That's what he said in breaking bad.
They would do is just like,

459
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,530
before they did anything,
they would just talk and talk and talk.

460
00:26:24,531 --> 00:26:27,230
And it's something as you look, we did
an undeclared. When I look back at it,

461
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:30,800
it's like we're just anxious
to get going I think sometimes.

462
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,680
But I feel like now,
I mean,

463
00:26:33,681 --> 00:26:38,570
and it's kind of always been this way in
that like we'll come up with ideas and

464
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:43,930
it's like sometimes it's like there's
almost like a Darwinistic process food a

465
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:46,883
year later or so.

466
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:50,340
Like if it's something we're still
talking about sometimes years later,

467
00:26:50,341 --> 00:26:53,160
there's some, I mean like there's this
movie that we're talking about writing.

468
00:26:53,161 --> 00:26:54,270
I was going through old files,

469
00:26:54,271 --> 00:26:59,120
like the first one from like 2011 or
something like that. Tangible example is,

470
00:26:59,121 --> 00:27:02,280
this is the end.
We had two separate ideas.

471
00:27:02,281 --> 00:27:06,630
One was a movie about the apocalypse
and another one was celebrities playing

472
00:27:06,631 --> 00:27:08,310
themselves in a disaster type scenario.

473
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:13,110
Both of those ideas that survived
for four, five years and they slowly,

474
00:27:13,111 --> 00:27:17,100
we realized if we merge these things,
it's going to be a good synthesis. And uh,

475
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:19,860
and that, that's the perfect
example. Like we, we, we, you know,

476
00:27:19,861 --> 00:27:22,830
we'd just be sitting around working
on whatever and it'd be like,

477
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:27,210
what about that apocalypse? Or it's just
what we talk about. Like, I mean, it's,

478
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:28,510
it's like,
you know,

479
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:32,570
we like what we do and it's fun for us
to think about it so organically we'd

480
00:27:32,571 --> 00:27:35,760
just be sitting there doing
something else. And that's the thing.

481
00:27:35,761 --> 00:27:39,990
We would just start joking around about,
you know? And then if it sticks around,

482
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:44,310
then it at least means that we like,
it isn't, I like, like, like, like,

483
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:48,030
like lately I've been obsessed with
artificial intelligence and we're not

484
00:27:48,031 --> 00:27:50,460
writing anything about that.
But in a year from now,

485
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:51,810
if I'm still talking about it,

486
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:52,930
maybe it'll happen.

487
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:55,510
So when you have something that's really
persistent like that, and you have,

488
00:27:55,511 --> 00:27:56,830
say the celebrities playing,

489
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:59,470
playing themselves and the end of
the world and you're like, you know,

490
00:27:59,471 --> 00:28:03,040
this could be really interesting if we
combine these two things at the time. Uh,

491
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:07,390
not necessarily now that you have the
input from the breaking bad writer on that

492
00:28:07,391 --> 00:28:10,420
approach, but what were the next steps
you guys took once you were like,

493
00:28:10,421 --> 00:28:12,550
you know what, let's, let's try
to pull the trigger on this.

494
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:17,830
Well, we, it took us a really long time
to figure out how to do it. Honestly,

495
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:20,670
that was one of those
movies were bizarrely,

496
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:25,940
it just took us like we could
think of the first three,

497
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:30,030
two acts of the movie and then we
couldn't figure out how to end the movie.

498
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:33,480
And it little joke was like a year and
a half I think until we thought of the

499
00:28:33,481 --> 00:28:37,260
idea that they realize they can
still redeem themselves basically,

500
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:39,510
which is what allows
the third act to happen,

501
00:28:39,511 --> 00:28:42,130
which is they're all starting
trying to redeem themselves and,

502
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,210
and we just didn't think of that and it
was literally just like we couldn't do

503
00:28:45,211 --> 00:28:46,740
it. I mean, while we're working
on other stuff and doing it,

504
00:28:46,741 --> 00:28:48,660
it's not like we're just sitting
in a room for a year and a half,

505
00:28:48,661 --> 00:28:51,360
like bang our heads against the wall.
It's like we're still doing things.

506
00:28:51,361 --> 00:28:53,540
But that if like,

507
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:58,550
I mean in that example it literally just
took us a really long time to come up

508
00:28:59,281 --> 00:29:01,770
with the idea that allowed the movie to,
to function.

509
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:03,300
And then once we thought of that idea,

510
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:06,210
I remember we wrote the first draft of
this in the end and like nine days or

511
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:10,230
something like that. That was all
three acts or just set the whole,

512
00:29:10,231 --> 00:29:14,130
we wrote the home movie like the
whole first, the hundred and 20 pages.

513
00:29:14,131 --> 00:29:18,150
We wrote the whole script. We Sat,
we had an extensive outline. Yeah,

514
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,140
because we'd been kicking it around
for years. And like one thing we do,

515
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,770
a lot of our movies are kind of
genre based, especially lately,

516
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:30,180
you know Pineapple Express and this is
the end and the interview to some degree.

517
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:33,270
And so something we do is just
watch tons of movies in that genre.

518
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:35,550
And so like with this the end,

519
00:29:35,551 --> 00:29:39,090
we just watched tons of these like
horror movies and apocalypse movies and

520
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:43,120
movies about isolation and kind of grew
little groups of people that are stuck

521
00:29:43,121 --> 00:29:47,530
together. And as we do that, we just are
joking around and coming up with ideas.

522
00:29:47,531 --> 00:29:51,010
Oh it wouldn't be funny if we, we
send a guy out on a rope, it's like,

523
00:29:51,011 --> 00:29:54,580
oh they need water. And then you just kind
of pick up these themes in the movies.

524
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,180
Like when Craig Robinson went out of the
house with a rope that was based off of

525
00:29:58,181 --> 00:30:00,620
the mist. Exactly. And part of it, I mean,

526
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:04,030
and we talk a lot about of it is like
really trying to like have our cake and

527
00:30:04,031 --> 00:30:06,390
eat it too.
In these movies like it,

528
00:30:06,391 --> 00:30:10,150
it's like we are kind of like mocking
the genres as we were trying to

529
00:30:10,151 --> 00:30:12,970
participate in the full heart fully,
you know?

530
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:15,490
And in doing that we'd like to,

531
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:19,000
it's almost like the characters in the
movie are aware of the same cultural

532
00:30:19,001 --> 00:30:20,290
references that we are.

533
00:30:20,291 --> 00:30:24,550
And so it would stand to believe that
all that stuff would be on the table

534
00:30:24,551 --> 00:30:25,560
basically.
And so,

535
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:30,610
so that's a big part of the process
is just lists of ideas. Tons of ideas.

536
00:30:30,611 --> 00:30:33,910
Jonah gets possessed, someone
gets puked on, they need water,

537
00:30:33,911 --> 00:30:37,630
someone steals the water, someone doesn't
like the rules. They try to make rules.

538
00:30:37,631 --> 00:30:39,850
How do they split up the
food and something like, oop,

539
00:30:39,851 --> 00:30:43,060
just at this into like a notebook or
do you put it into a word document?

540
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,750
It's just a,
it's just a running list.

541
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,600
There's yelling right now with the latest
idea we're messing about with like a

542
00:30:49,601 --> 00:30:50,171
10 page.

543
00:30:50,171 --> 00:30:52,750
We have like a 10 page lists and I
think there's another 10 pages this week

544
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,840
literally. And it's like, it's
like a relationship type movie.

545
00:30:55,841 --> 00:30:59,590
So there's like I do, it's just like
things happen to us. It was just like,

546
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:04,240
oh a fight about this
husband who holds back, wife,

547
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:07,990
wife who enhances husbands positive.
And then it's just like,

548
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:11,710
it's also just like house warming party.
Like it's things like that and like,

549
00:31:11,711 --> 00:31:14,320
or we'll go to a party and something
funny will happen and you put that in.

550
00:31:14,321 --> 00:31:18,490
So it's just a stream of consciousness
collection and, and again and like,

551
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,650
and like the ideas themselves.

552
00:31:20,651 --> 00:31:23,290
As you go through these lists over
and over throughout the years,

553
00:31:23,291 --> 00:31:26,650
some ideas you kind of stick in your
head and you remember and some start to

554
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:31,570
seem stupid and you start to create
characters kind of based on the ideas are

555
00:31:31,571 --> 00:31:34,690
sometimes you call with the characters
first and sometimes you'll just meet

556
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,400
someone and you'll be
like someone like that,

557
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:40,270
someone who is going through this in
life for, you know what I mean? Um,

558
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:43,180
and it can come from anywhere.

559
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:47,740
And then for a while we got really uh,
uh,

560
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:51,820
and then process wise I think we
kind of strayed a little bit in that.

561
00:31:51,821 --> 00:31:52,810
We got so busy,

562
00:31:52,811 --> 00:31:56,650
we started kind of like farming it
out just a little bit to other people,

563
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:59,330
which is something that we're
kind of trying to not do is

564
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:01,900
do a lot of stuff.

565
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:05,020
And so we had other people writing stuff
for us and it all worked out very well,

566
00:32:05,021 --> 00:32:06,370
but we got it.

567
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:12,270
I think literally at the end of the
day if like the thing we are best at is

568
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,790
actually writing and,

569
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:20,180
and I think we kind of stopped doing that
honestly for awhile in Lou we got to,

570
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:25,630
we got the opportunity to become directors
and that was so exciting that we just

571
00:32:25,631 --> 00:32:28,390
want it to direct another one and then
we'd go home and we will be coming

572
00:32:28,391 --> 00:32:33,310
producers as well which and like, and it
was all kind of, it wasn't like a plan.

573
00:32:33,311 --> 00:32:37,240
It was a very organic thing
that was happening as our
careers we're building and

574
00:32:37,241 --> 00:32:41,540
expanding in a different directions.
But that was happening looking back,

575
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,580
uh,
our writing,

576
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:47,540
which is probably the thing we're best
at got kind of pushed to the side a

577
00:32:47,541 --> 00:32:47,901
little bit,

578
00:32:47,901 --> 00:32:52,901
but now that we've done I think a pretty
okay job setting up these other things

579
00:32:53,391 --> 00:32:57,380
are producing is going very well or
directing, you know, is established.

580
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:02,680
And so I think we can refocus on writing
things and kind of settled back into

581
00:33:03,861 --> 00:33:07,910
what we were doing really exciting too
because the producing and the directing

582
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:09,710
caused this cycle where it was like,

583
00:33:09,711 --> 00:33:13,070
we got to get another one out because we
need to, you know, you direct one movie,

584
00:33:13,071 --> 00:33:16,100
you're not really a director until they
can drink like two or three things and

585
00:33:16,101 --> 00:33:18,230
then they're like, oh, this
guy's not going anywhere.

586
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:20,330
But now that we've
gotten past that hurdle,

587
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:23,390
we can go back to what we really liked,
which is writing things and not rushing.

588
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:27,300
Yeah, exactly. How did the first
script you guys collaborated on, uh,

589
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:32,470
that got sold or got made a
cross that chasm Superbad yeah,

590
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:37,160
it took 10 years and years and years.

591
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:42,170
Basically I moved to La to do
freaks and Geeks, um, when I was 17.

592
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,570
Just a quick interjection then.
Why did they do a casting call?

593
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:46,940
It was at your high school? No, it was um,

594
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:50,960
or they went to Vancouver sometimes on,
um,

595
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:56,240
based in La. It was, it was, it was based,
it was set in Michigan. It was shot in La.

596
00:33:56,540 --> 00:34:00,860
But sometimes, uh, Judd and
Paul Judd Apatow and Paul Feig,

597
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:03,080
the Creator and Paul
the Creator and judge,

598
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:07,280
the executive producer of
freaks and geeks. It had a very,

599
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:11,840
they wanted very real kits and they had
an idea from the beginning that they

600
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:14,210
wouldn't find them in
that if you're in La,

601
00:34:14,211 --> 00:34:17,990
you're like an actor kid and that there's
a good chance that you are not what

602
00:34:17,991 --> 00:34:20,360
they're looking for. That
being said, I think they cast,

603
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:24,560
I think everyone but me and
one other guy out of la,

604
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:29,390
but so they were kind of wrong but
thank God they looked at least because,

605
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:32,900
so what they did is they did casting
calls of Vancouver and Boston and New York

606
00:34:32,901 --> 00:34:37,901
and Chicago and Toronto and all these
cities and I got to audition in May Coover

607
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,730
and they were there like Paul and
Judd, like we're in Vancouver. Yeah.

608
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:47,960
They were like in the room and I recognize
Paul Feig cause he's in this movie a

609
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:52,420
ski patrol, which I had seen
Jason's keep control. And so, uh,

610
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,490
see the topless woman,
no

611
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:01,940
pervy version of Ski School Ski
Patrol's not that pervy this may be one.

612
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:08,220
And that's why I was sort of it it,
yeah, it's not, it's not ski school. Um,

613
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:13,040
but that threw me anyway. Um, and so yeah.

614
00:35:13,041 --> 00:35:16,850
And so they cast me from Vancouver and
I moved to l w I went there and shot the

615
00:35:16,851 --> 00:35:20,190
pilot and then I came back and
then it got picked up and then I'm,

616
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:23,690
and so I was very lucky cause I
like moved to La like with a job.

617
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,890
Like I wasn't like one of,

618
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:29,270
I didn't have to like go to La and
like try to find work for myself.

619
00:35:29,271 --> 00:35:33,230
Like I went there employed,
which was like, I,

620
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:36,260
at the time I didn't realize like
how many massive hurdles when it was

621
00:35:36,261 --> 00:35:39,590
overcoming just by doing that,
you know what I mean? Um,

622
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:44,690
and then so I was there and then meanwhile
we're writing super bad and I give it

623
00:35:45,271 --> 00:35:50,271
to Judd and Judd Judd was very
busy at the time running the show,

624
00:35:51,061 --> 00:35:55,410
which was like going down in flames
basically, even though it was very good.

625
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:59,940
And so he kind of didn't pay too much
attention to it at first. But Jake Kasdan,

626
00:35:59,941 --> 00:36:04,920
who was one of the directors of the
show, um, who has gone on to direct,

627
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,760
uh, tons of movies and stuff like that,
he directed the pilot of freaks and Geeks.

628
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:13,800
He, um, he really, he's
just like a very nice guy.

629
00:36:13,801 --> 00:36:15,580
He was around,
he was in his twenties.

630
00:36:15,581 --> 00:36:19,590
He's very young and so he just like
really took a lot of time to like sit with

631
00:36:19,591 --> 00:36:23,040
me and talk to me about it. He
would give us notes on it. And like,

632
00:36:23,041 --> 00:36:25,410
it was just very encouraging
because he was like,

633
00:36:25,411 --> 00:36:29,150
this is good and you can keep working
on this. And I was just at university

634
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,950
see it at McGill in Montreal a little
time because I couldn't come to America

635
00:36:32,951 --> 00:36:35,760
even if I wanted to, cause I didn't have
a visa. His Dad's American dads in there,

636
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:40,840
but I wanted to be a writer and it
seemed like via him on freaks and Geeks,

637
00:36:40,841 --> 00:36:45,000
we had an inlet. So I studied us history,
so I knew who I was writing for. Right.

638
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:48,960
Yeah. Good idea. I loved history and
I thought if I understood America,

639
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:49,760
it gets better.

640
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,920
I could write better for Americans because
I knew that I knew Canadians. And uh,

641
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,250
and America is quite different.

642
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:59,540
Yeah.
But then after at some point,

643
00:36:59,541 --> 00:37:02,610
jug did read it and it was,
um,

644
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:08,090
during the show we did a undeclared.
So freaking he's got canceled.

645
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,940
And then because Judd read super bad,

646
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:13,850
he got another show going the
next year called undeclared,

647
00:37:13,851 --> 00:37:15,680
which was about college freshmen.

648
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:20,090
I was literally the exact age
of a college freshman. And so,

649
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:23,900
and he liked how super bad was written,
so he hired me as a writer on the show.

650
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:29,000
And so, and then juring on
declared he really like,

651
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:30,500
took,
uh,

652
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:35,710
like a produce oriel role on Superbad and
we'd give us tons of notes and try to,

653
00:37:37,131 --> 00:37:39,740
and that's when we first started
going around trying to sell it.

654
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:44,490
That was in like 2000,
2001. And then 2002. Yeah.

655
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:45,403
He said,

656
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:46,870
bring your friend on down.
I'll,

657
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:50,730
I'll throw him a tiny bit of cash so
he can live and you guys should try to

658
00:37:50,731 --> 00:37:51,564
write something else.

659
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:54,750
So I came down and we spent two
months writing Pineapple Express,

660
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:58,500
which he told us to come up with a
hundred ideas for movies, which is insane.

661
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:03,450
We got to 50 which is great. We
never made any of them. And then, uh,

662
00:38:03,451 --> 00:38:04,680
and then he was like,
these are awesome,

663
00:38:04,681 --> 00:38:08,820
but you should instead write a movie
about a pothead who's a process server who

664
00:38:08,821 --> 00:38:10,110
gets hunted by his own dealer.

665
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:14,370
And we said that's stupid and that will
end your career before it ever happened

666
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:17,520
to be like a modern Cheech and
Chong. And he just said, ah,

667
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,810
but what if it was good?

668
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:21,340
Yeah. We were like, oh
what if it was good?

669
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:26,860
We love action movies and you know,
die hard and lethal weapon.

670
00:38:26,861 --> 00:38:27,310
And they were like,

671
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:30,460
oh what if we kind of make it like a
nineties like these nine these action

672
00:38:30,461 --> 00:38:31,690
movies that we love so much.

673
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:36,410
And so we wrote pineapple trust pretty
like we just loved it. It wasn't,

674
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:40,310
we started doing, we really well
[inaudible] ourselves in the morning,

675
00:38:40,311 --> 00:38:42,160
like maybe like six weeks
or something like that.

676
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:46,300
It was like one of those things where
like wake up at 3:00 PM until 6:00 AM we

677
00:38:46,301 --> 00:38:49,060
were very unhealthy at
this time in our lives.

678
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:52,600
This was that the time when we got a
Costco card and gained like 20 pounds

679
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:55,460
reading seafood get passed in
cheese because it was cheap

680
00:38:57,020 --> 00:39:00,490
all day long. It was gross. So,

681
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:02,050
so by the end of,

682
00:39:02,051 --> 00:39:07,030
I think like 2002 both pineapple express
and super bad were written and just no

683
00:39:07,031 --> 00:39:10,920
one wanted to make them. And it would,
it would come close, it'd be someone, oh,

684
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:12,970
we might make it and then it
wouldn't happen. And we might make,

685
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:15,670
and every now and then,
and like I didn't have the money to do it.

686
00:39:15,671 --> 00:39:17,590
I would fly down,
we would go and pitch it,

687
00:39:17,591 --> 00:39:21,040
or my dad would drive with me from
Vancouver and we'd go and pitch it.

688
00:39:21,041 --> 00:39:23,200
And every time we pitched it,
probably 10 times,

689
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:26,530
Judd and Seth and me would go and my
dad would drop me off and we'd go in and

690
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:28,870
they'd be like, we love this, this
is great. And we're like, okay,

691
00:39:28,871 --> 00:39:30,460
so you're gonna make it. And
they're like, oh no, we can't.

692
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:35,410
And I was supposed to play the Seth role.
And slowly throughout this process,

693
00:39:35,411 --> 00:39:39,100
like I just, I still remember the
meeting where like always I was like,

694
00:39:39,101 --> 00:39:42,340
I'm going to place that. And that I
remember like it took so many years,

695
00:39:42,341 --> 00:39:43,630
there was like what BD rose like,

696
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:46,870
I think this was the meeting where I
no longer should say that I'm going to

697
00:39:46,871 --> 00:39:49,720
place that cause I'm 23 years old.

698
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:56,490
So we uh, these were studio heads
or studio exactly what it was.

699
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:57,310
It was,

700
00:39:57,310 --> 00:40:01,480
it was some new companies with like weird
money that comes from who knows where

701
00:40:01,481 --> 00:40:05,740
it was some studios, it was like
every type of thing you could imagine.

702
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:10,030
Basically when did the, instead of
the other shoe drop in the positive.

703
00:40:10,031 --> 00:40:14,140
So meanwhile like we start getting work,
we get hired on the leg show,

704
00:40:14,141 --> 00:40:17,150
which is great. Um, and it's just, it,

705
00:40:17,151 --> 00:40:20,500
it starts to make things
like pick up a little for us.

706
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,000
I was in the 40 year old virgin,

707
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:25,840
like things like that started to happen
and while he was doing 40 old virgin

708
00:40:25,841 --> 00:40:28,300
just invited me to
participate in some capacity,

709
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:31,510
but I knew I had to finish my degree
so I could actually stay legally.

710
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:33,610
So I finished my degree in,
missed out on that.

711
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:38,740
And by the time I came down the premiere,
it happened and the movie had hit. Yeah.

712
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:43,480
And so Judd started to become
a successful movie person. Um,

713
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,140
like a,

714
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:47,830
it was now a director and writer and a
producer and incredibly successful one.

715
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:51,010
So, uh, an increment had
come out and done well,

716
00:40:51,011 --> 00:40:55,450
which he was a producer on and then
Talladega nights came out and did really

717
00:40:55,451 --> 00:40:57,590
well.
And I think it was wait,

718
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,890
Talladega nights didn't come
up before we made knocked up.

719
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:03,060
They made knocked up first,
didn't we? We did. I don't

720
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:06,430
know.
I don't think so.

721
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:10,570
I remember going with Judd
to the Deville Film Festival,

722
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:14,050
I think for 40 year old virgin
while he was here in Atlanta.

723
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:17,680
I think shooting Talladega Nights,
I'm bad with years in time.

724
00:41:17,681 --> 00:41:19,480
But this was approximately,
you would have happened.

725
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:23,290
And then around now it's like,

726
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:25,270
you know when you get
successful like Judd was,

727
00:41:25,271 --> 00:41:27,430
people just start wanting
whatever you have.

728
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,240
And so it was Sony was just like,

729
00:41:31,241 --> 00:41:33,660
we'll make stuff and so they Superbad

730
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:39,160
and then at the time to make an a however
much it was like 22 million like it

731
00:41:39,861 --> 00:41:43,940
was, uh, it was, it was a
bizarre model that had never
been done. No famous people,

732
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:44,840
low budget.

733
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:47,870
It was kind of an experiment in the
studio was doing to see if they could make

734
00:41:47,871 --> 00:41:52,130
big movies at a smaller budget
without famous pan. They also, pun,

735
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:56,520
what's crazy is knocked up
pineapple express and super bad.

736
00:41:56,521 --> 00:42:01,521
We're all made in like one year I think
basically like we made them like back to

737
00:42:02,091 --> 00:42:07,010
back to back because that
it was essentially like once
the flood opened we just

738
00:42:07,011 --> 00:42:09,480
like shoved everything
in there that we like.

739
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,480
If you just look at like statistically
we're going to be done in two years. Yeah,

740
00:42:13,481 --> 00:42:13,921
exactly.

741
00:42:13,921 --> 00:42:18,410
So you have to take advantage of the
way everything and and then and then

742
00:42:18,411 --> 00:42:21,590
knocked up and knocked up and sue bag
came out the same summer in both did

743
00:42:21,591 --> 00:42:22,424
really,
really well.

744
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:26,300
And so he was a coproducer on 40 old
virgin and they made him an IEP on,

745
00:42:26,301 --> 00:42:30,020
knocked up and judge just made
me an e p two which was bonkers.

746
00:42:30,021 --> 00:42:32,690
And I remember on the third day,
Evan's first day on set,

747
00:42:32,691 --> 00:42:33,800
he was an executive producer

748
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,250
[inaudible] universal studios.

749
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:40,443
I remember

750
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:41,820
really hard cause I was like,

751
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:45,150
can I just take however
much water I want again man,

752
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:47,010
you can have all the water you want.
And I was like, what about the coffee

753
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:52,890
cups of coffee a day? And I remember I
saw Katherine Heigl and I was like, Hey,

754
00:42:52,891 --> 00:42:54,990
what's up? We've been working
together for like a week.

755
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,970
And then she went up to
set and it was like, wow,

756
00:42:56,971 --> 00:42:58,820
that guy has got a lot of energy.
He's got great.

757
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:01,071
He was like,

758
00:43:01,071 --> 00:43:06,071
oh this is his first week
on the moon reaction.

759
00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:10,720
Evan, when you first found out the
sewer bad was going to get made.

760
00:43:10,721 --> 00:43:15,250
I mean it was that, I mean I assume
I freaked out and lost my mind. Uh,

761
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:20,180
I don't remember. Or was it not
such a blur? Because as he said,

762
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:23,110
it all went down in one year.
It was just the most exciting year ever.

763
00:43:23,111 --> 00:43:27,770
But also for me, like he'd been working,
yeah, I've been going to school. Right.

764
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:32,020
Which meant not going to
school and getting drunk and
hanging out with friends.

765
00:43:32,021 --> 00:43:33,370
Like I barely went to class,

766
00:43:33,371 --> 00:43:38,371
so I had this shocking shift from like
slackers student to working 14 hours a

767
00:43:38,831 --> 00:43:39,340
day.

768
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:43,330
And I remember I would have to sneak
away and just like go into a bathroom and

769
00:43:43,331 --> 00:43:46,480
sleep for like 20 minutes because I
wasn't used to it. I couldn't handle it.

770
00:43:46,481 --> 00:43:49,750
That's why I'm drinking so much coffee.
It was a really hard transition for me,

771
00:43:49,751 --> 00:43:52,930
but knocked up was kind of like
boot camp because you know,

772
00:43:52,931 --> 00:43:55,720
it was his big shot to make
something really huge for sure.

773
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:59,410
So we would go 16 hours,
17 hours, 14 hours days,

774
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:01,480
and I almost lost my mind.
But by the end of it,

775
00:44:01,481 --> 00:44:04,870
I think I was like Kinda a battle hardened
to ride, get a condition for it all.

776
00:44:04,871 --> 00:44:06,280
And what,
what were some of the,

777
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:11,110
the lessons that you guys learned have
learned from Judd? I mean, what are the,

778
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:14,020
some of the takeaways for whether
it's the creative process or, so

779
00:44:14,370 --> 00:44:18,080
that's a, that's a whole
other, we could fail. The

780
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:21,160
biggest thing we learned from him,
in my opinion, he's like, and,

781
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:24,170
and we talked about this earlier,
is don't keep stuff to yourself.

782
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:26,030
Like when you're
surrounded by smart people,

783
00:44:26,031 --> 00:44:28,700
bring them in and get other people's
opinions to share it with them.

784
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:33,390
And most importantly, emotion is what
matters. It's an emotional journey.

785
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:36,570
It doesn't matter if the aircraft carrier
hits the skyscraper in a collapses

786
00:44:36,571 --> 00:44:37,404
onto the hero.

787
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:40,560
It's what is he feeling when that happens
and why does it matter that he has to

788
00:44:40,561 --> 00:44:43,530
get out of the rubble?
He just taught us like emotion is the key.

789
00:44:43,531 --> 00:44:46,590
Like the 40 old virgin is a
crazy, weird movie. It's insane.

790
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:51,120
But it's about a guy who's got
like a wound that he wants to heal.

791
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:53,610
And through this journey. He does.
And it's, it's all about that.

792
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:54,700
You mentioned that to me in every,

793
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:58,050
every character has to have a
wound that's a big Jug Judaism.

794
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:03,030
Yeah. I think I mean about the process.
I mean he basically like, yeah,

795
00:45:03,031 --> 00:45:06,060
like taught us the process
that we use a lot. I mean,

796
00:45:06,061 --> 00:45:09,360
especially in regards to collaboration and

797
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:13,820
[inaudible] he was somewhat
revolutionary in, in, in how he did it.

798
00:45:13,821 --> 00:45:16,940
Like people had done it before,
like a Christopher guest and other people.

799
00:45:16,941 --> 00:45:21,620
But Judd figured out a way to make improv
and mainstream movies collide in a way

800
00:45:21,621 --> 00:45:22,910
that I don't think anything,

801
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:25,880
no one was really doing it like that.
And yeah,

802
00:45:25,881 --> 00:45:29,060
I mean the filming process
itself, um, and how,

803
00:45:29,061 --> 00:45:33,510
how to work on set is something that he
thought was a lot about. I mean, again,

804
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:36,590
it's all, it was Tufts that was
partially figured out together,

805
00:45:36,591 --> 00:45:40,730
but he worked for years and
years and years before us.
And I mean, it's so funny.

806
00:45:40,731 --> 00:45:45,260
It often, I remember one time we were
filming a scene and knocked up I think,

807
00:45:45,261 --> 00:45:48,230
and improvising and he's,
or maybe it was even 40 old virgin,

808
00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:50,270
the direction he screamed at us,

809
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:54,320
cause he screams direction from
another room a lot, which is hilarious.

810
00:45:54,590 --> 00:45:58,130
But when he screamed at us was less semen,
more emotion.

811
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:02,510
And I think like that is
actually like across the board.

812
00:46:02,511 --> 00:46:06,970
Good note to apply.
[inaudible]

813
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:11,090
yeah. But, uh, I think it was
just the area we were riffing on,

814
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:15,830
but I think, uh, yeah, I mean what
happened was saying exactly right,

815
00:46:15,831 --> 00:46:20,620
like the emotional core. Like what,
what does it really you about? Like, um,

816
00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:23,050
and,
and that the movies and then,

817
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:27,250
and that movies can be very
sweet and still like, uh,

818
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:31,220
and especially if you're good at make
a movie that is so like, you know,

819
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:36,250
I'm dirty or aggressively,
you know, um, you know, uh,

820
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:39,410
filled with profanity
and that thing that like,

821
00:46:39,411 --> 00:46:42,100
it helps if they're sweet
and if you really like,

822
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:46,040
if they're not mean spirited and if you,
uh, and, and, and write what, you know,

823
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:50,870
it was a big thing and try to inject your
own like honesty and experiences into

824
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:55,250
your work,
even if it's a weird spy movie or end.

825
00:46:55,990 --> 00:47:00,790
It is just about Jay and Seth and Jay
is upset that Seth has found new friends

826
00:47:00,850 --> 00:47:03,880
and Seth is upset that Jay seems
to be holding onto the past.

827
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:07,090
That's what the movie's about. It has
nothing to do with the apocalypse really.

828
00:47:07,690 --> 00:47:08,790
That's just the,
the,

829
00:47:08,850 --> 00:47:13,850
the area at all went down in when
looking at filmmaking or comedy movies

830
00:47:14,921 --> 00:47:15,701
specifically,

831
00:47:15,701 --> 00:47:20,560
if you guys could have written something
that someone else wrote and besides

832
00:47:20,561 --> 00:47:21,700
your own stuff where you're like,
ah,

833
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:26,250
adaptation adaptation, it's
the best. It's the best movie.

834
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:30,120
It's a masterpiece and the
script is even better than

835
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:35,140
the a movie. I think they made the
right choice with the changes they made.

836
00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:39,070
But the script is just unreal.
That's like one of those,

837
00:47:39,071 --> 00:47:41,380
not a lot of movies
making like mind blowing.

838
00:47:41,381 --> 00:47:43,870
We jealous when I saw
that I was just like,

839
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:47,230
like five of my best
ideas. Like I was like, oh,

840
00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:49,930
there should be a movie with someone who
has anxiety represented by a character.

841
00:47:49,931 --> 00:47:53,350
And I was like, oh, he did this
10 times better than I ever could,

842
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,720
plus 10 other things
that I had as a whole.

843
00:47:55,721 --> 00:47:57,460
And the mood is like funny and awesome.

844
00:47:57,461 --> 00:48:00,490
And like it's just the story of how
that came together. Also in terms,

845
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:05,160
yeah. That he was hired to write bad
uptake, freaked out and it could do it.

846
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:07,200
It's like,
it's metal

847
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:12,070
backstory is, is so funny. And
then I would say on the flip side,

848
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:17,080
to me the most magical, uh, emotional
beautiful movies, the princess bride,

849
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:20,950
my favorite. Yeah. It's just,
I can't watch it too much.

850
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:22,830
That was, uh, you know,

851
00:48:23,190 --> 00:48:26,050
I've had this fascination of screenwriting
even though I haven't pulled the

852
00:48:26,051 --> 00:48:29,020
trigger on anything, but the,
the screenplay that the did,

853
00:48:29,021 --> 00:48:31,140
it was the princess bride reading.
Uh,

854
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:36,660
William Goldman had the book on it. So
good. It's a great, all the backstory.

855
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:39,850
It's the one of the scenes in
adaptation because you mentioned it.

856
00:48:39,851 --> 00:48:43,120
One of my favorite scenes is when he's
sitting in the movie Nicholas Cage,

857
00:48:43,121 --> 00:48:45,640
sitting in his apartment at
this typewriter and he's like,

858
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:47,433
[inaudible] you hear me?

859
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:51,850
Internal dialogue.
So hungry,

860
00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:55,720
like I need some coffee.
What are, what are your

861
00:48:55,880 --> 00:49:00,290
opinions of writer's block? Oh,
ah, we touched on this earlier.

862
00:49:00,291 --> 00:49:04,670
I think writer's block is complete
bullshit legion. Is it? Yeah,

863
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:07,770
sure.
I have it right now.

864
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:14,230
Like it's a term people give to a
bad week. Like I have bad weeks.

865
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:18,370
I don't have writer's block. Writer's
block implies that like you can't do it.

866
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:20,050
Some things are just
harder than other things.

867
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,050
Like you could have said that
we had writer's block on.

868
00:49:23,051 --> 00:49:25,000
This is the end when we couldn't
figure out the third act.

869
00:49:25,210 --> 00:49:26,440
I don't call that writer's block.

870
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:31,330
I say that was the biggest struggle
that we just have never experienced it.

871
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:33,820
Uh,
which is why you don't think it exists.

872
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:38,440
But I think that like you think that
we've never said no way. I imagine,

873
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,810
I think what I think what
happens to people actually,

874
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:42,370
and we're just lucky that
we haven't experienced it,

875
00:49:42,371 --> 00:49:45,640
is they become uninspired like that
I think is what writer's block is.

876
00:49:45,641 --> 00:49:47,590
And we're just lucky because
that has never happened to us.

877
00:49:48,070 --> 00:49:51,940
I take issue with the term,
especially block writers,

878
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:55,740
difficulties writers
struggle with writer's cramp.

879
00:49:56,550 --> 00:49:59,020
Writer's block implies like
it's just not going to happen.

880
00:49:59,021 --> 00:50:04,021
But I think if you truly
lose your inspiration or your
who you are as a creative

881
00:50:04,361 --> 00:50:08,230
person, I think people experience
those moments. And that's right here.

882
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:09,480
I think that's what writer's block.

883
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,240
What would you attribute that to?

884
00:50:11,241 --> 00:50:15,530
Do you think that's because you guys
are writing what you know or what is,

885
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:21,350
yeah,
this

886
00:50:21,650 --> 00:50:22,820
is not doing great.

887
00:50:22,821 --> 00:50:26,060
The other one can pick up the
weight when one of us is uninspired.

888
00:50:26,061 --> 00:50:28,030
The other one could be like
by Romans where I'm just like,

889
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:30,140
I don't even know what the fuck we're
doing anymore. Why are we doing this?

890
00:50:30,141 --> 00:50:32,120
And then he'll just have an idea
and I have to just keep going.

891
00:50:32,121 --> 00:50:35,020
And then you plow through and there's
probably moments he's thinking the similar

892
00:50:35,021 --> 00:50:37,340
thing and I'm,
and in that moment I'm not thinking that.

893
00:50:37,341 --> 00:50:40,570
And so it allows us to keep
going. But there's, there's,

894
00:50:40,890 --> 00:50:44,870
there's a beauty to writing stuff on
your own. But specifically for movies,

895
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:48,800
I think writing as a team is extremely
beneficial. Even if you do write alone,

896
00:50:48,830 --> 00:50:51,560
you should be sharing what you're
writing with everyone all the time,

897
00:50:51,561 --> 00:50:55,190
all the time.
Because writer's block as some call it,

898
00:50:55,191 --> 00:50:59,270
and I would rather not easily be solved
by just getting someone to help you.

899
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:01,010
Right. And I think a lot of writers, uh,

900
00:51:01,110 --> 00:51:02,750
the biggest problem I think
writers have is they're like,

901
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:07,430
I can't show people until it's ready. And
that's poppy. You show it immediately.

902
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:09,760
I think if you just talk
about your ideas are like,

903
00:51:09,770 --> 00:51:14,540
and I think that's how if
you have writer's block
that like there's probably a

904
00:51:14,541 --> 00:51:15,291
reason you have it,

905
00:51:15,291 --> 00:51:19,100
there's probably a reason
you're uninspired and that
is the thing you should be

906
00:51:19,101 --> 00:51:19,881
writing about.

907
00:51:19,881 --> 00:51:24,320
Like I think and I think in
order to arrive at that you
need to talk to someone.

908
00:51:24,321 --> 00:51:24,951
Sometimes it's like,

909
00:51:24,951 --> 00:51:28,520
and I think that's why it's helpful to
have another person is like we're very

910
00:51:28,521 --> 00:51:29,540
open with each other.

911
00:51:29,541 --> 00:51:32,630
We talk about pretty much everything
that's happening in our lives with one

912
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:33,260
another.

913
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:38,260
And so it's not like I'd just be sitting
there grumpy and he's like gotten an is

914
00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:43,340
like no, not, not feeling it
today. Like, like we would,

915
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,590
I would explain why and
that would probably,

916
00:51:45,591 --> 00:51:49,010
we do an idea because we
like to write them that way.

917
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:52,420
That's why it to both of us adaptations,
the most genius thing ever. Cause a guy,

918
00:51:52,421 --> 00:51:56,480
it's a movie about writers took
writer's block and made it something.

919
00:51:56,670 --> 00:51:58,890
And I guess that's my beef with
writer's block is like that's,

920
00:51:58,970 --> 00:52:02,750
it's just something stopping
you, but it'll put you in
another direction. So it's,

921
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:07,760
it's still the path you're taking. Who,
who in your mind, whether right now,

922
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:09,470
you know,
alive or dead or the most,

923
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:13,460
some of the more underrated
comedy writers will,

924
00:52:13,461 --> 00:52:17,860
Hannibal Burress is a standup comic.
He's not a writer,

925
00:52:17,870 --> 00:52:22,730
but that man is a unspeakable genius.
Hannibal burse, Burris, Burris, he,

926
00:52:22,731 --> 00:52:24,820
uh, he started this whole
bill Cosby thing and yeah,

927
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:28,980
if you don't bill Cosby
[inaudible] attribute that

928
00:52:31,010 --> 00:52:34,730
we have a guy who we're working with
named Joe. Mandy is bizarrely genius.

929
00:52:35,330 --> 00:52:38,710
I think Sasha was one of the funniest guy.
I mean,

930
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:43,070
Garry Shandling is brilliant to me.
Like the Larry Sanders show,

931
00:52:43,071 --> 00:52:44,660
I think in a lot of ways,

932
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:49,230
does a lot of the stuff that a lot
of people try to do today. There's a,

933
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:52,610
there's an animator who I think and
writer who I think was one of the greatest

934
00:52:52,611 --> 00:52:57,380
geniuses to ever live named
Don Hertzfeld and he's amazing.

935
00:52:57,381 --> 00:52:59,120
He made this thing called rejected.

936
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:03,300
That is the funniest thing I think I may
have ever seen in my entire life. He, he,

937
00:53:03,330 --> 00:53:06,470
he animates by hand usually
with a 16 millimeter camera.

938
00:53:06,471 --> 00:53:09,590
He just started using computers a
little, but, uh, it's, it's, he's really,

939
00:53:09,591 --> 00:53:11,900
it's like stick figures literally,
and it's,

940
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:16,970
it's the most genius thing I've ever
seen. He's incredible. Um, and uh, yeah,

941
00:53:16,971 --> 00:53:21,020
he's probably not as lauded as one
could be. I think he gets nominated for,

942
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:25,950
I think he won an Oscar action. Nevermind.
Fuck. It does a really good looking.

943
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:31,440
But uh, yeah, I mean I I
think like, uh, Matt, uh,

944
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:35,780
and tray of Southpark and book of Mormon
to me are like two of the funniest

945
00:53:35,781 --> 00:53:40,750
humans ever created. Again,
Judd and I mean, who,

946
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:41,753
who is like,

947
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:46,310
like growing up I was really
into like SCTV like Martin short

948
00:53:47,890 --> 00:53:51,730
and in the hall on SCTV
played on a loop in the hall.

949
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:53,880
The hall is like in the halls,
like very,

950
00:53:53,881 --> 00:53:57,260
it was very influential on us and
we watched it a ton growing up.

951
00:53:57,261 --> 00:53:58,940
I've seen every single episode.
Like,

952
00:53:58,970 --> 00:54:01,880
I never will turn on an episode
and it's one, I haven't seen it.

953
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:04,250
You want to see what one that kind
of changed our lives, Shirley,

954
00:54:05,030 --> 00:54:09,680
which is one of the strangest,
and they did this short,

955
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:13,910
I believe how sausage sausage is s.

956
00:54:13,911 --> 00:54:17,780
H. I. R. L. I. N. G. It's a made up word.

957
00:54:18,550 --> 00:54:22,160
But what was great about kids will
hold is how insane it was. And like,

958
00:54:22,190 --> 00:54:24,080
and it was, and, and, and,

959
00:54:24,190 --> 00:54:27,080
and at the time it didn't seem insane
because we watched it so much and it was

960
00:54:27,081 --> 00:54:30,710
on so much as we got older and started
to make stuff, we realized like,

961
00:54:30,890 --> 00:54:35,090
I don't think I could get that show
on air right now. It's so bonkers.

962
00:54:35,091 --> 00:54:38,060
And the fact that they got to do whatever
they want it even though like two out

963
00:54:38,061 --> 00:54:39,860
of the five times it was a big miss.

964
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:43,520
The other times it's just like they
nailed it because they got to do what they

965
00:54:43,521 --> 00:54:45,020
really want it to in their hearts.
And like,

966
00:54:45,050 --> 00:54:47,610
we've gotten to work with
Lauren Michaels and I've, uh,

967
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:49,700
I've got to be around them a bunch.
And like,

968
00:54:49,730 --> 00:54:52,610
that's one of the things we
talked to him about the most.

969
00:54:52,611 --> 00:54:56,060
Every time we're around him and he, and
he's very proud of the show, but he says,

970
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:56,991
I mean,
he's like,

971
00:54:56,991 --> 00:55:01,490
the key to that show was letting those
guys do whatever they wanted and that was

972
00:55:01,550 --> 00:55:03,770
it. He's like, that
was, that show was like,

973
00:55:04,130 --> 00:55:08,250
they had to do all of it cause that's
how crazy it was. We also had a,

974
00:55:08,390 --> 00:55:12,380
well also quickly, Mel Brooks was like
a huge thing. Laura is amazing. I mean,

975
00:55:12,381 --> 00:55:15,440
he's not like no one is being
a writer by trade or anything,

976
00:55:15,441 --> 00:55:17,170
but he's a very funny guy and like,

977
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:21,590
it's like the Steve jobs of columns
and it's unbelievable what he's done.

978
00:55:21,591 --> 00:55:25,990
And like, he's someone that every time I
am around him, it's like, uh, it's, it's,

979
00:55:25,991 --> 00:55:29,750
it's truly like an awe inspiring.
Just from being in Canada,

980
00:55:29,751 --> 00:55:30,890
we had a lot of British television,

981
00:55:30,891 --> 00:55:34,750
so we got a lot of those like
Fawlty towers and Monte Python.

982
00:55:34,970 --> 00:55:39,780
That gave us like a, uh, an attitude
towards comedy, that Ab Fab.

983
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:44,780
Did you watch that growing up? My
Mom, absolutely fabulous. Yeah.

984
00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:48,560
My parents were really into comedy and
watched a lot of woody Allen movies when

985
00:55:48,561 --> 00:55:50,280
I was growing up and like,
uh,

986
00:55:50,670 --> 00:55:55,670
are there needs late bloomers in comedy
writing who has not say known since they

987
00:55:55,971 --> 00:56:00,380
were kids that they want it to be in
comedy or in writing who have kind of come

988
00:56:00,381 --> 00:56:04,880
onto the scene and done well that come
to mind. I mean that come to mind.

989
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:10,430
There must be, there must be. I mean it's
a tough question but it's a good one.

990
00:56:10,431 --> 00:56:15,410
I can't think of anyone. More
comedy directing, acting Ferris.

991
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:20,500
Yeah, exactly. [inaudible]
funny. It's usually accidental.

992
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:22,420
Uh,
you

993
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:23,253
want a mosque on?

994
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:28,660
I can't, I can't think of any one of
those things though where it's like,

995
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:32,560
and, and I think it's what
brings comedians together.

996
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:36,430
It's so funny cause like whenever
you go, I don't, which I don't often,

997
00:56:36,431 --> 00:56:39,400
but at the times I do go to
like a Hollywood type party.

998
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:43,210
All the comedians are often like lumped
together in one little section because

999
00:56:43,211 --> 00:56:46,860
they often all know each other
and and their, and their,

1000
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:48,190
and often they're the type,

1001
00:56:48,191 --> 00:56:50,980
they're similar types of people
for whatever bizarre reason,

1002
00:56:50,981 --> 00:56:53,890
known some things and little kids and
they want to be a comedian buttoned down

1003
00:56:53,891 --> 00:56:58,090
and this is maybe overgeneralizing
but they comedians know that life is

1004
00:56:58,091 --> 00:57:01,870
ridiculous and I think that's like a
common bond that holds them all together.

1005
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:04,540
Well,
they're never going to figure this out.

1006
00:57:04,541 --> 00:57:08,550
This is all absurd and let's kind
of analyze how redundant a party.

1007
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:11,050
They're all the people who want to stand
on the corner and make fun of the Party

1008
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:16,350
and so they all, so they all go down and
then sometimes the whole Party is that.

1009
00:57:17,070 --> 00:57:17,760
Okay.

1010
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:21,230
Brian Callan is a bit on the podcast
and buddy's a stand up comic.

1011
00:57:22,470 --> 00:57:24,240
He gave me my first tour
of the comedy store.

1012
00:57:24,330 --> 00:57:28,260
He's in the 40 year old
virgin movie doc off, right.

1013
00:57:28,390 --> 00:57:29,223
Oh,
which one

1014
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:36,410
that Vicky is,
I could be wrong,

1015
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:41,440
but he gave me my first tour at the
comedy store and the bunch of the comics,

1016
00:57:41,581 --> 00:57:44,630
she's ended up standing outside basically
making fun of the Party and shooting

1017
00:57:44,631 --> 00:57:48,290
the shit. But that's where the real comedy
is, is right outside the comedy club.

1018
00:57:49,450 --> 00:57:54,110
When you just think of it could
be more broadly outside of comedy,

1019
00:57:54,111 --> 00:57:56,960
like Evan, I'll ask you first, when
you think of the word successful,

1020
00:57:56,961 --> 00:57:58,670
who's the first person
who comes to mind for you?

1021
00:57:59,630 --> 00:58:02,450
Uh,
uh,

1022
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:07,000
honestly my cousin David was that,
I got it.

1023
00:58:07,110 --> 00:58:07,980
I got two cousins,

1024
00:58:07,981 --> 00:58:11,040
David and Charlie who live in Orange
County and they just have a really nice

1025
00:58:11,041 --> 00:58:15,150
note life in three or two great kids.
And every time I go to their house,

1026
00:58:15,210 --> 00:58:18,880
I think this is the most successful group
of people I know just because they're,

1027
00:58:19,050 --> 00:58:21,570
they're really happy and they
all really like each other.

1028
00:58:21,571 --> 00:58:25,560
And it's rare to have a family that
everyone likes everyone and they're all

1029
00:58:25,561 --> 00:58:27,930
proud of each other.
So corny answer,

1030
00:58:27,931 --> 00:58:32,880
but my cousins date more people aren't
like that or don't have that. Um,

1031
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:37,110
I think they just made up their minds
and I think other people deliberate too

1032
00:58:37,111 --> 00:58:39,730
much. Like they were just like, he
was like, I'm a doctor. She was like,

1033
00:58:39,731 --> 00:58:41,490
I'm going to be a teacher.
We want to kids,

1034
00:58:41,491 --> 00:58:45,000
we're going to live there and we're going
to make the best of our lives and uh,

1035
00:58:45,030 --> 00:58:47,520
go to the beach whenever
we can. They just, like, I,

1036
00:58:47,521 --> 00:58:50,280
they seem to have cut through a lot of
the bullshit and made their lives very

1037
00:58:50,281 --> 00:58:53,040
simple in a beautiful way.
And,

1038
00:58:53,070 --> 00:58:55,310
and it's all about their kids and I dunno,

1039
00:58:55,350 --> 00:58:58,770
I just feel like they are
the most levelheaded people
I know who have stuff like

1040
00:58:58,771 --> 00:59:00,230
really figured out.
Okay.

1041
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:03,150
What yourself,
when you got to say something emotional,

1042
00:59:03,151 --> 00:59:05,270
you're going to be Michael Jordan.

1043
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:10,440
[inaudible].

1044
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:14,920
Uh Huh. Uh, I don't know.

1045
00:59:14,921 --> 00:59:19,800
My parents I feel like seemed
pretty happy and uh, um,

1046
00:59:20,470 --> 00:59:20,960
yeah,

1047
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:25,670
I definitely don't ascribe like
a financial meeting Jewish,

1048
00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:29,210
um, off the top of my head. Uh, yeah,

1049
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:31,520
my parents were on a cruise
in Alaska right now eating.

1050
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:35,330
They just sent me a picture of a meal
that entirely comprised of Tater tots and

1051
00:59:35,331 --> 00:59:36,350
beer.
So

1052
00:59:36,450 --> 00:59:38,130
I'd say they're doing
pretty well right now.

1053
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:42,240
His Dad has somehow made vegetarianism,
unhealthy,

1054
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:48,330
unhealthy vegetarian on the entire planet.
But, uh, yeah, my parents were very,

1055
00:59:48,331 --> 00:59:48,800
very happy.

1056
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:53,350
Be Honest, Lee and um,
and, and have always, uh,

1057
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:56,400
I've always seen, they're very like,
they're pretty like Zen, I got to say,

1058
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:59,960
which to me is like a, a
good, a good place to be.

1059
00:59:59,961 --> 01:00:04,610
And what I strive to be is, is
just a peace, a peace with myself.

1060
01:00:05,230 --> 01:00:06,063
Do you

1061
01:00:06,070 --> 01:00:10,890
Ooh, uh, Seth give books as
gifts ever? If so, I mean,

1062
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:12,850
do you have a most gifted book
that you've given to people?

1063
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:18,080
Um, I don't give books as gifts.
I give, I give some times like,

1064
01:00:18,110 --> 01:00:22,050
uh, like coffee table
type books as gifts. Um,

1065
01:00:22,610 --> 01:00:27,020
but like if someone's in a move, like
a, I like coffee table books, I'm not,

1066
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:30,470
I read a, and I give comic
books sometimes to people.

1067
01:00:30,650 --> 01:00:33,920
I don't often give books to people
as gifts because I'm not myself,

1068
01:00:33,921 --> 01:00:35,670
like a huge retreat.
I'm not like,

1069
01:00:37,190 --> 01:00:39,290
have I given the people I've
given preacher to people,

1070
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:41,720
I've given watchman to people.
I've used it.

1071
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:45,410
I've given hitchhiker's guide to the
galaxy to people. Cause I love that book.

1072
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:47,480
And if they tell me they haven't read it,
I give that to them.

1073
01:00:47,930 --> 01:00:50,930
I've given this book the art of
dramatic writing to people cause it's

1074
01:00:51,210 --> 01:00:53,320
house.
That's,

1075
01:00:53,321 --> 01:00:56,710
that's something that John told us to
read book Judd gave us art of dramatic.

1076
01:00:56,711 --> 01:00:58,420
Yeah. If you're, if you're a writer,

1077
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:02,320
60% of it's useless and
40% of it is references,

1078
01:01:02,321 --> 01:01:07,321
a lot of plays that if you haven't read
and you haven't because know who has it,

1079
01:01:08,070 --> 01:01:11,310
it just does it. A lot of it is
very referential in certain places.

1080
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:14,680
The best part of is explains
the importance of premise
and how you must have a

1081
01:01:14,681 --> 01:01:17,860
rock solid one sentence,
premise or thesis

1082
01:01:18,060 --> 01:01:21,240
for the movie itself. Um, I
remember when Joe gave it to us,

1083
01:01:21,241 --> 01:01:23,070
he said it was woody Allen's
favorite writing book,

1084
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:27,750
which was meaningful at the time. And
so, uh, I've given that book to people.

1085
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:33,120
Um, the, the, that, uh, conquest
of happiness I've given to people.

1086
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:35,940
Oh, that's a good book. That's
by Bertrand Russell Virtue.

1087
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:39,970
It's like the original cell,
like the racial epitaphs. Yeah.

1088
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,680
That's the time at the time
were more acceptable than it

1089
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:46,220
all. Right. He was written in like 1920
or something like that, I think. Great.

1090
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:49,040
But um, it's a, it's a great,

1091
01:01:49,070 --> 01:01:52,790
it's like one of the gee self
help books basically. Right. Um,

1092
01:01:52,910 --> 01:01:57,740
I think like the gist of the book is
like some say life is pleasurable,

1093
01:01:57,750 --> 01:01:59,160
some say it isn't.
So I think,

1094
01:02:01,730 --> 01:02:01,980
okay.

1095
01:02:01,980 --> 01:02:06,010
Um, and so, uh, I've given those
books to people. Yeah. But not a,

1096
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:07,730
I don't give a ton of books to people.

1097
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:11,980
I know we only have a little bit of time
left, but Evan, what, what about yourself?

1098
01:02:11,981 --> 01:02:16,500
Do you have him most uh,
every uh,

1099
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:20,580
uh, new found? Every person who
becomes mother, who's a friend of mine,

1100
01:02:20,581 --> 01:02:24,420
I send this Canadian child's book love
you forever too, which I think is just,

1101
01:02:24,421 --> 01:02:27,240
bless you forever.
The number two or wherever it's a,

1102
01:02:27,241 --> 01:02:29,280
it's got a thing to love you forever.
Love you for always.

1103
01:02:29,281 --> 01:02:30,890
As long as you're living
my baby, you'll be, it's,

1104
01:02:30,891 --> 01:02:34,740
it's like a thing my mother and son and
I think that's a beautiful book that I

1105
01:02:34,741 --> 01:02:36,930
give to anyone. It's, but it's beautiful.

1106
01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:38,670
Yeah.

1107
01:02:40,150 --> 01:02:44,450
Unbelievably depressing. No one's
been upset. I gave it to them. Really?

1108
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:46,830
That not to you?
A little bit.

1109
01:02:46,910 --> 01:02:51,430
A little prince is phenomenal
hitchhiker's guide and then I often give a

1110
01:02:51,850 --> 01:02:54,670
preacher v for vendetta
and the watchman to people.

1111
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:56,380
But my main thing is love you forever.

1112
01:02:56,381 --> 01:03:00,290
I think that like anyone who has a
kid should have that book. No, we,

1113
01:03:00,291 --> 01:03:02,140
we were talking about
this briefly yesterday,

1114
01:03:02,141 --> 01:03:06,560
but could you describe the habit that
you picked up from Snoop Dogg? Um,

1115
01:03:06,790 --> 01:03:11,110
over the context. We were smoking
pot with snoop. What happened?

1116
01:03:11,111 --> 01:03:13,540
Did you pick up and,
and we were,

1117
01:03:13,630 --> 01:03:17,410
this is when we were recording that song
and we were hanging out with him and we

1118
01:03:17,411 --> 01:03:19,420
were smoking. You opposed
come in when you, right now,

1119
01:03:19,590 --> 01:03:21,990
yeah.

1120
01:03:22,510 --> 01:03:24,000
I can only write with hose around

1121
01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:29,140
and I don't know how we got to this,
but he was like,

1122
01:03:29,590 --> 01:03:34,000
you look to go for walks. I was like,
not really, I don't really. He's like,

1123
01:03:34,001 --> 01:03:37,720
what do you mean? I was like, oh,
I'll go for like exercise or whatever,

1124
01:03:37,721 --> 01:03:39,190
but I don't just go for walks.

1125
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:41,500
And he looked at me really
disappointed and was like, you should,

1126
01:03:41,620 --> 01:03:45,010
you should go for walks, man. That's a
bad move. You're making a bad mistake.

1127
01:03:45,430 --> 01:03:49,930
And it haunted me that like snoop Dogg
was disappointed I can take walks.

1128
01:03:50,230 --> 01:03:53,140
So I started taking a walk in the
morning and a walk after dinner.

1129
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:57,400
Eddie has massively changed my life. I
sleep better. I have a better day because,

1130
01:03:57,401 --> 01:03:58,660
and I just walked for like 10 minutes,

1131
01:03:58,990 --> 01:04:01,600
but he just kind of went
on like a little mini rant,

1132
01:04:01,630 --> 01:04:04,690
Sang Lik walking's great man. It's,
it's important. I walk with my kids,

1133
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:09,940
walk people like having dogs. Yeah.
Yeah. Steve Jobs was a famous walker.

1134
01:04:11,170 --> 01:04:14,560
I'm not joking. He was known for
like doing meetings on walks.

1135
01:04:14,561 --> 01:04:18,010
Like instead of like sitting in a
office doing a meeting, he would,

1136
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:21,960
they would walk around and now started
to, I become obsessed with, like I,

1137
01:04:21,970 --> 01:04:26,440
I will stretch during meetings and I
don't care who it's with. I will as,

1138
01:04:26,441 --> 01:04:30,680
as with you, I will stand
for full meetings because
I don't like sitting and a,

1139
01:04:30,710 --> 01:04:32,530
we're trying to get a new
office and when we do,

1140
01:04:32,590 --> 01:04:34,960
I'm putting a treadmill in there,
a bunch of other stuff.

1141
01:04:34,961 --> 01:04:37,510
Cause when we're writing I'm often
just like walking around the room.

1142
01:04:37,511 --> 01:04:42,110
Like I it in a pencil in my hand, try
a treadmill desk on. My friend has it.

1143
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:44,920
It takes a little while to get used to,
but I don't think I could do that.

1144
01:04:44,950 --> 01:04:46,060
I've heard it.
I've heard it's good.

1145
01:04:46,061 --> 01:04:49,090
I saw someone running on a treadmill
reading a book at the gym this morning.

1146
01:04:49,091 --> 01:04:51,490
It sounds like no one's written
a hilarious joke on a treadmill.

1147
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:55,540
That's never happened to me.
I have,

1148
01:04:55,630 --> 01:04:59,140
I have an elevating desk that goes up
and down, but I will try the treadmill.

1149
01:05:00,010 --> 01:05:02,230
What? Uh, yeah, the key is not running.

1150
01:05:02,350 --> 01:05:06,000
Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And
having a safety safety

1151
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:10,950
clip on it. Uh, if, uh, if you
could have given your seats,

1152
01:05:11,260 --> 01:05:14,810
this is a 25 year old self, some
advice, what would you have?

1153
01:05:15,090 --> 01:05:19,030
What would you have said?
I would have told myself to lose weight,

1154
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:20,530
no earlier

1155
01:05:22,250 --> 01:05:26,870
slots, like 25 pounds. And I feel so much
better and my brain is so much sharper.

1156
01:05:27,140 --> 01:05:29,060
And I was just,
I wasn't like massively overweight,

1157
01:05:29,061 --> 01:05:33,680
but I was overweight for those
from 25 to 31 and that was a very,

1158
01:05:33,681 --> 01:05:34,730
very big mistake.

1159
01:05:35,030 --> 01:05:38,090
That was very fixable and I wished that
I could go back in time and be like,

1160
01:05:38,091 --> 01:05:42,560
just start walking. You start walking them
nice walk. So we'll fix this all. And,

1161
01:05:42,561 --> 01:05:43,430
and uh,

1162
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:46,790
and I found out I was allergic to wheat
so I wish I could go back in time and

1163
01:05:46,791 --> 01:05:47,624
tell myself,

1164
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:51,430
cause I found that out three years

1165
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:53,450
we go.
And if I found that out six years ago,

1166
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:56,630
I would have had a lot better of a decade
about yourself. So I don't know. I was,

1167
01:05:56,690 --> 01:05:58,160
I was probably a lot healthier when I was,

1168
01:05:58,180 --> 01:06:02,630
I was really doing better by all beads
when I was 25 that I have right now. Um,

1169
01:06:03,950 --> 01:06:07,550
I probably would have told
myself to propose to my wife
sooner. Oh yeah, me too.

1170
01:06:09,410 --> 01:06:12,490
That would have saved me. And
why is that? Just cause I waited.

1171
01:06:12,491 --> 01:06:15,900
I waited like seven, six, six, nine.

1172
01:06:18,260 --> 01:06:22,550
I don't know. Probably not. But uh, it was
probably like a, what do they call that?

1173
01:06:22,551 --> 01:06:24,560
Enabling?
I think we probably enabled each other,

1174
01:06:27,580 --> 01:06:28,281
but I don't know,

1175
01:06:28,281 --> 01:06:31,760
I mean I don't have any like major
regrets that have occurred between now and

1176
01:06:31,761 --> 01:06:34,910
then or any like,
I think there's lessons I've learned,

1177
01:06:34,911 --> 01:06:39,900
but they've been valuable and
organic to my living process. Uh,

1178
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:42,520
but the proposal I should've
proposed sooner that,

1179
01:06:42,521 --> 01:06:46,050
that I would have done differently.
Uh, this could be a set,

1180
01:06:46,051 --> 01:06:48,990
maybe a similar type of question,
but for you haven't,

1181
01:06:48,991 --> 01:06:52,920
if you could have one billboard anywhere
that said anything, what would it,

1182
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:57,840
what would be on it? Ooh. Um, uh,

1183
01:06:57,841 --> 01:06:58,890
I've had a lot of billboards,

1184
01:06:58,950 --> 01:07:03,950
so [inaudible] you have a child.

1185
01:07:04,130 --> 01:07:07,720
Exactly. Whatever knocked out when
I, before coming out, November 24,

1186
01:07:09,730 --> 01:07:13,750
I guess my biggest beef with the world
that I would throw up on a billboard is,

1187
01:07:13,751 --> 01:07:17,890
uh, this, this is going to get deep
guys. No, except each other. Oh,

1188
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:22,210
Evan Uhmm. I don't accept that. I don't
like when people don't accept one another.

1189
01:07:22,330 --> 01:07:25,690
I think they should and I would put it
on top of the empire state building.

1190
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:27,550
Really?
People wouldn't see it very well.

1191
01:07:27,610 --> 01:07:28,740
Well, okay, fine.

1192
01:07:31,270 --> 01:07:36,250
She way to the Empire State building, uh,
accepting each other's good. I like that.

1193
01:07:36,310 --> 01:07:38,060
Except each other or just

1194
01:07:38,650 --> 01:07:42,360
meet with a picture of me
except

1195
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:47,140
Seth Rogen. Well, I uh, I know we're,

1196
01:07:47,141 --> 01:07:48,720
we're wrapping up here.
You guys have a lot to do.

1197
01:07:49,470 --> 01:07:53,820
A little 11 more minutes tomorrow.
In that case,

1198
01:07:53,970 --> 01:07:56,210
I would like to, when we leave
we have to go back to our jobs.

1199
01:07:58,820 --> 01:08:02,580
Postpone that a little bit to
ask a couple of fan questions.

1200
01:08:02,581 --> 01:08:04,290
This one is from Kyle Bailey.
Uh,

1201
01:08:04,350 --> 01:08:06,930
he wants to know about the future
of comedy and this is what he says.

1202
01:08:07,030 --> 01:08:10,230
[inaudible] string theory.

1203
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:14,520
What is funny on one side of the universe
creates a funny reaction on the other

1204
01:08:14,521 --> 01:08:15,470
side.
No one knows why.

1205
01:08:18,580 --> 01:08:19,390
He says,

1206
01:08:19,390 --> 01:08:22,870
it seems to me that late seventies
and then 80 satire Saturday night live

1207
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:24,670
Seinfeld has led to all things funny.

1208
01:08:24,930 --> 01:08:28,900
That has led to all things funny being
absurd. Hence old spice commercials.

1209
01:08:28,901 --> 01:08:31,390
Having mandatory so on
seems like the more absurd,

1210
01:08:31,391 --> 01:08:35,110
the funnier at least in the mainstream
when will the snap back or when will we

1211
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:38,080
experienced in the next direction of
comedy or is absurdity of the final act of

1212
01:08:38,081 --> 01:08:41,580
comedy and then somebody added to that
specifically on not online where you're

1213
01:08:41,590 --> 01:08:44,990
trying to grab attention,
distract.

1214
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:49,410
I heard actually with
marketing specifically recently
someone told me that uh,

1215
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:54,500
that now commercials like actually do
better if they make no sense like that.

1216
01:08:55,291 --> 01:08:57,630
Literally just like mountain
dew commercial. Have you
guys seen that mountain?

1217
01:08:57,980 --> 01:09:01,170
Like the horse and the one where it's
like this horse a tell you like there's

1218
01:09:01,171 --> 01:09:02,460
literally like I,

1219
01:09:02,490 --> 01:09:06,150
someone was explaining to me the theory
where it's like the fact that they make

1220
01:09:06,151 --> 01:09:11,151
no sense actually makes you
pay more attention to them
then a than a traditional

1221
01:09:11,341 --> 01:09:14,820
commercial narrative. I actually don't
necessarily agree with that. Yeah,

1222
01:09:14,821 --> 01:09:18,850
I got a degree. It's not absurd.
Transparent. It's not absurd.

1223
01:09:19,070 --> 01:09:23,790
Train wreck is one of the biggest comedies
of the year and it's like completely,

1224
01:09:23,940 --> 01:09:27,440
you know, a us, you know,
a very grounded movie.

1225
01:09:27,630 --> 01:09:31,020
Like we love ourselves and absurd comedy.
But Ethan,

1226
01:09:31,050 --> 01:09:35,160
both neighbors is our most successful
movie. And then a lot of ways it goes,

1227
01:09:35,220 --> 01:09:38,590
it's quite broad at times,
but in premise it's,

1228
01:09:38,650 --> 01:09:42,030
it's about people who have a bunch
of kids move in next door to them.

1229
01:09:42,190 --> 01:09:45,780
Like it's not that bizarre,
you know? So I actually think,

1230
01:09:46,230 --> 01:09:49,610
I think the biggest comedies are,
and are not absurd there.

1231
01:09:49,611 --> 01:09:52,200
There's somewhat grounded in reality and,

1232
01:09:52,490 --> 01:09:57,360
and the less th the somewhat popular but
maybe less popular comedy, he's like,

1233
01:09:57,361 --> 01:09:58,650
this is the end was,
did very well.

1234
01:09:58,651 --> 01:10:02,160
But isn't it the same universe as like
neighbors or train wreck is doing much

1235
01:10:02,161 --> 01:10:02,511
better than that?

1236
01:10:02,511 --> 01:10:06,270
Like I think those truly absurd ones I
actually don't do as well as the more

1237
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:07,133
grounded one.

1238
01:10:07,150 --> 01:10:09,370
Well, it's like, you know, I'm
a mental, I mean I, not absurd,

1239
01:10:09,371 --> 01:10:13,480
but it's so it's confusing to so many
people. I mean, I love Memento, but uh,

1240
01:10:13,770 --> 01:10:15,630
but it's been set a kind
of disheartening to,

1241
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:18,010
to find that a lot of my favorite
movies did very, very, very good.

1242
01:10:18,460 --> 01:10:21,100
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh wait.

1243
01:10:21,230 --> 01:10:25,660
We always say this will never
be number one. And if we are,

1244
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:28,150
we won't be that cool
anymore. Yeah, it's true.

1245
01:10:28,151 --> 01:10:31,270
Like we always will have the sense of
really where it's like things everyone

1246
01:10:31,271 --> 01:10:34,930
loves, I hate and things everyone
ate. I love. And I'm just, I,

1247
01:10:34,931 --> 01:10:38,410
and I don't mean that in like a, I'm not
trying to be like a hipster. And I do,

1248
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:40,480
I also love a lot of mainstream stuff.

1249
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:45,610
And like I'm the first guy in line
to see a Michael Bay movie. But fast,

1250
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:48,040
fast and furious is the greatest
time you could have it in a bag.

1251
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:51,400
But that being said, like there's
some shows that are really popular.

1252
01:10:51,401 --> 01:10:51,731
I'm just like,

1253
01:10:51,731 --> 01:10:54,730
I don't understand why people like this
and there's some shows that no one likes.

1254
01:10:54,731 --> 01:10:56,810
And I'm like, I don't call why people
don't love this, you know? And,

1255
01:10:56,811 --> 01:10:59,500
and as long as you have that sensibility,

1256
01:10:59,530 --> 01:11:02,470
I think there's a good chance you will
not be the most successful person.

1257
01:11:04,020 --> 01:11:07,230
I mean, it's along those lines. It's of
freaks and Geeks. Looking back at that,

1258
01:11:07,231 --> 01:11:11,170
I mean, what, and this is a question
from nick, nick, a breakthrough. Uh,

1259
01:11:11,250 --> 01:11:14,430
what was it about freaks and
Geeks at the made so successful

1260
01:11:14,430 --> 01:11:16,190
in their later careers?
Is that a,

1261
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:20,460
would you attribute to advice they
received or more of a networking effect or

1262
01:11:20,461 --> 01:11:22,830
otherwise?
I'm paraphrasing but

1263
01:11:23,550 --> 01:11:28,350
I think honestly,
I mean my hope is that that judge just,

1264
01:11:28,351 --> 01:11:32,140
and Paul found people who
happened to me very talented and,

1265
01:11:32,141 --> 01:11:36,270
and I had the talent to sustain themselves
and then they cast very well. Yeah,

1266
01:11:36,271 --> 01:11:39,450
I think they cast very well.
And I like having cast movies with Judd.

1267
01:11:39,451 --> 01:11:40,900
Like he's just got the iron man.

1268
01:11:42,050 --> 01:11:45,150
He's very good at seeing is it just
an instinctual thing or is there,

1269
01:11:45,450 --> 01:11:48,000
is there some that you get better at it,
it's literally just,

1270
01:11:48,001 --> 01:11:50,760
there's not that many really funny people.

1271
01:11:50,761 --> 01:11:55,140
And like when you see someone who's
actually very funny like, and if you're,

1272
01:11:55,530 --> 01:11:58,880
it's again when we, you know, you talk
about it with investments, it's the exact,

1273
01:11:58,890 --> 01:12:03,890
like you start to hone in on just like
things that for whatever reason you start

1274
01:12:04,651 --> 01:12:08,000
to think like this is good.
Like, and I think you,

1275
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:10,680
you can train yourself to become
more and more in tune with it.

1276
01:12:11,010 --> 01:12:15,780
And I think that's one of the things
Judd taught us is like keep your eyes out

1277
01:12:15,781 --> 01:12:16,471
for that person.

1278
01:12:16,471 --> 01:12:20,780
If you're watching a movie and someone
is in one scene and it has one line and

1279
01:12:20,790 --> 01:12:24,370
is funny, that person could star in
a home movie one day maybe. Yeah.

1280
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:29,960
In the first neighbors there's this
standup drug Carmichael who's in it and he

1281
01:12:29,961 --> 01:12:33,660
now has his own show and we're trying
to write a movie a with our guys Kaolin

1282
01:12:33,661 --> 01:12:38,280
reo for him to start it. And it all just
came from our uh, coworker Alex saying,

1283
01:12:38,281 --> 01:12:40,020
I saw this guy and he's,
he's got it.

1284
01:12:40,380 --> 01:12:45,360
Yeah, look, look yourself
like a cat. And I think that,

1285
01:12:45,390 --> 01:12:49,830
I think more than anything, that's what
it is, is that they, he has a very good,

1286
01:12:50,430 --> 01:12:54,750
you know, Paul and Jack both have very
good eyes for spotting people that we'll,

1287
01:12:54,751 --> 01:12:56,400
that we'll keep working on.
Another thing is,

1288
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:59,610
um,
they look long and hard.

1289
01:12:59,730 --> 01:13:03,150
Like when we were looking for who is
going to be the MC Loven Fogel character

1290
01:13:03,151 --> 01:13:06,900
and super bad, it literally came down
to putting up signs in high schools.

1291
01:13:06,901 --> 01:13:09,600
Allison Jones, the casting
director, did an epic search,

1292
01:13:09,810 --> 01:13:13,080
literally just putting up signs. Does
anyone know anyone who fits this bill?

1293
01:13:13,081 --> 01:13:17,880
And his buddies were like, you should go
do this. And we saw like, I don't know,

1294
01:13:17,881 --> 01:13:20,460
a hundred kids and that's
just what we saw. A, you know,

1295
01:13:20,461 --> 01:13:24,940
a filtered from the casting
director onto us. And, and, and,

1296
01:13:24,950 --> 01:13:27,660
and it's like a Hollywood cliche almost,
but when you see that person,

1297
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:31,710
you go get him. That's the one. Yeah.
So just on Vic loving, because this,

1298
01:13:31,711 --> 01:13:36,660
this came up surprisingly
often. Uh, Justin,

1299
01:13:36,830 --> 01:13:40,800
uh, nine of Basti I think.
And then den Gmo designs,

1300
01:13:40,801 --> 01:13:42,840
I'm not sure I ask them if they,

1301
01:13:42,841 --> 01:13:45,720
if they would ever be willing to make
a spin off movie about Nick Levin.

1302
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:49,890
We are not. But we have discussed, which
we'll never do. What am I about to say?

1303
01:13:49,891 --> 01:13:53,160
But we always thought it would be funny
to kind of do something where you take

1304
01:13:53,161 --> 01:13:54,120
Saul from pineapple,

1305
01:13:54,121 --> 01:13:57,720
express the James Franco character and
Mcclellan from Superbad and put them in a

1306
01:13:57,721 --> 01:13:59,490
movie together,
but it's never happened.

1307
01:13:59,550 --> 01:14:02,130
So why would you never do it in the
same way that Donald Trump thinks,

1308
01:14:02,131 --> 01:14:07,020
if he changes his hair, he'll ruin his
career to us. Like super bad worked.

1309
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:10,620
It was everything we ever hoped it would
be and more. And I'm not touching it.

1310
01:14:10,770 --> 01:14:12,170
I'm not.
It's like if you throw two bulls

1311
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:12,871
eyes and you're like, no, no,

1312
01:14:12,871 --> 01:14:17,170
don't was actually the best the way I
made a sequel to super bad and it was bad.

1313
01:14:17,350 --> 01:14:20,500
It would crush me. Exactly.
Yeah. I don't want to mess with,

1314
01:14:20,550 --> 01:14:25,360
I couldn't deal with that. Does a, it's
of course we'd comes up a lot. Uh, eat.

1315
01:14:25,450 --> 01:14:26,283
What's that?

1316
01:14:27,780 --> 01:14:32,770
The marriage you want to do you find
it helps creativity, productivity.

1317
01:14:33,130 --> 01:14:34,300
Neither. Both. I mean,

1318
01:14:34,530 --> 01:14:39,050
because there are questions about like
how do you be youth for you two guys? One,

1319
01:14:39,051 --> 01:14:42,370
what impact does it have that it makes
you a little dumber while you're on it.

1320
01:14:43,030 --> 01:14:47,680
But for us, uh, you know, no matter what
job you have, no matter how amazing it is,

1321
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:51,250
it's work and work in some ways sucks.

1322
01:14:51,550 --> 01:14:54,100
And what we've tried to do at our office,

1323
01:14:54,460 --> 01:14:58,300
like we have a big buck hunter in our
office and just taking five minutes and

1324
01:14:58,301 --> 01:15:01,030
playing around a big buck hunter.
It like lets you chill out,

1325
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:04,300
going for a little walk to get
a cup of coffee. Well it's been,

1326
01:15:04,330 --> 01:15:07,600
and for us and for some people
it's a very, very bad idea.

1327
01:15:07,630 --> 01:15:09,220
I would say like most people,

1328
01:15:09,250 --> 01:15:13,720
it makes them look so much worse that they
shouldn't. But some people it relaxes.

1329
01:15:13,721 --> 01:15:14,770
I think what's important,

1330
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:19,800
I think why it's helpful to us is because
it's what we do socially and and so it

1331
01:15:20,111 --> 01:15:22,750
makes work not feel like work.
And I was,

1332
01:15:22,810 --> 01:15:26,050
I was actually just like yesterday
reading this thing that Isaac,

1333
01:15:26,210 --> 01:15:27,700
like it was an old article,

1334
01:15:27,701 --> 01:15:31,360
but Isaac Asimov wrote about the creative
process that was just republished.

1335
01:15:31,630 --> 01:15:36,490
And one of the things he talks a
lot about is, is in his process,

1336
01:15:36,491 --> 01:15:40,810
how it's very important to create
like a casual environment. And it,

1337
01:15:40,811 --> 01:15:42,340
he says like you shouldn't
work in an office.

1338
01:15:42,341 --> 01:15:45,700
You should work in someone's living
room or at a restaurant and you should.

1339
01:15:45,700 --> 01:15:47,320
And you need people who are jovial,

1340
01:15:47,321 --> 01:15:52,321
who so you can create a fun environment
because a lot of writing is failure.

1341
01:15:52,481 --> 01:15:54,970
And if you're self conscious
that you're going to be rejected,

1342
01:15:54,971 --> 01:15:59,440
then you won't say your best
ideas. And, and I think again,

1343
01:15:59,470 --> 01:16:04,160
if it's, I think our thing happens to be
smoking weed with some people. It's, it's,

1344
01:16:04,170 --> 01:16:04,931
it's other things.

1345
01:16:04,931 --> 01:16:09,820
But I think because it makes how
we're working feel like a not working

1346
01:16:09,821 --> 01:16:10,630
environment.

1347
01:16:10,630 --> 01:16:14,920
It makes our brains function
in a slightly more free way.

1348
01:16:14,921 --> 01:16:18,850
And it makes us pitch ideas that maybe
we would feel we're too stupid to pitch

1349
01:16:18,851 --> 01:16:22,930
if we were in a more rigid environment
and it would make ideas like this is the

1350
01:16:22,931 --> 01:16:24,070
end not exist,

1351
01:16:24,250 --> 01:16:29,250
not because were stoned but because we
are working in an environment that feels

1352
01:16:29,531 --> 01:16:34,090
very safe and that feels very
social and casual and that,

1353
01:16:34,540 --> 01:16:35,191
um,
and,

1354
01:16:35,191 --> 01:16:39,880
and that lets us pitch out the ideas that
might seem like the craziest ideas you

1355
01:16:39,881 --> 01:16:40,660
could ever pitch out.

1356
01:16:40,660 --> 01:16:43,630
But because we don't feel like we're
in a work environment where everyone's

1357
01:16:43,631 --> 01:16:47,890
judging us and that we're
wasting time or not, you know,

1358
01:16:47,980 --> 01:16:52,600
hitting the numbers are quotas that we
have to be hitting it. It allows us,

1359
01:16:52,601 --> 01:16:56,470
I think to be more free creative.
Yeah. Like in our office right now,

1360
01:16:56,710 --> 01:16:59,800
Seth has a bunch of paintings that he's
bought over the years from home and he

1361
01:16:59,801 --> 01:17:02,000
put them around and it feels like home.
That's what I like.

1362
01:17:02,010 --> 01:17:06,010
And I had like my yoga blocks and my
yoga straps and doing the stretches to me

1363
01:17:06,011 --> 01:17:09,890
is, is akin to the smoking pot,
which is like the best, uh,

1364
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:11,730
Caucasian squat

1365
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:13,230
does.
I've ever seen it

1366
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:16,220
state.
He doesn't have the sitting position.

1367
01:17:16,221 --> 01:17:19,730
Usually it goes from straight standing
to perfect as in Japan that we call it

1368
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:22,460
[inaudible] is the shit squad.

1369
01:17:22,620 --> 01:17:23,740
Yeah.

1370
01:17:23,770 --> 01:17:26,790
Well it's what they call and tell him
what you bought me like a platform that

1371
01:17:26,791 --> 01:17:29,650
goes around his toilet
so he can squat shit.

1372
01:17:31,860 --> 01:17:35,580
There's one thing people listening to
this should take from this podcast. It's,

1373
01:17:35,581 --> 01:17:39,780
you should be squatting when you shit,
it's natural. It's better for you.

1374
01:17:39,781 --> 01:17:43,140
It's bad for your back, it's bad for your
bowels and sit on a toilet, pop a squat.

1375
01:17:43,930 --> 01:17:47,110
What do you guys use, and I feel
like since you guys grew up in uh,

1376
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:52,200
in BC that it's a for that is to pot as
like growing up in France would be to

1377
01:17:53,471 --> 01:17:57,400
wine. Is there a particular
type of politics? I've had
friends be like, no man,

1378
01:17:57,401 --> 01:18:00,540
you get anxious because of this.
You're using the wrong thing.

1379
01:18:01,220 --> 01:18:03,480
Those friends or possibly correct.
Um,

1380
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:07,220
I had somebody who was telling me
the pots too strong. I don't like it.

1381
01:18:07,250 --> 01:18:10,310
It makes me anxious. So I went to one
of the stories in California and said,

1382
01:18:10,460 --> 01:18:12,170
can you give me some pot from 1995?

1383
01:18:12,860 --> 01:18:15,460
And they did and I gave it to the
person and they were like, there you go.

1384
01:18:16,730 --> 01:18:18,990
It goes by as strong as

1385
01:18:21,820 --> 01:18:23,110
the weakest link.

1386
01:18:23,111 --> 01:18:28,030
What is the absolute worst weed you could
buy now is what the best read was when

1387
01:18:28,031 --> 01:18:29,870
we were in high school.
Probably you can,

1388
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:33,160
we have a problem where people will
smoke pot with us and we'll be like,

1389
01:18:33,161 --> 01:18:37,780
take it easy. We don't smoke
week stuff. We continued smoking.

1390
01:18:37,781 --> 01:18:42,180
Good read. But to get
name specific, uh, uh,

1391
01:18:42,210 --> 01:18:45,310
Jack Hair. Yeah, he is a good working one.

1392
01:18:45,340 --> 01:18:48,370
There's also good ones for
work and ones that very simple.

1393
01:18:48,371 --> 01:18:51,810
There's sativas and indicas and sativas
are genuinely kind of uppers and indicas

1394
01:18:51,870 --> 01:18:53,110
are genuinely kind of downers.

1395
01:18:53,111 --> 01:18:57,010
And when you're working a
sativas generally better
because it's not bogging you

1396
01:18:57,011 --> 01:19:00,670
down.
Jack has e h e r r.

1397
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:03,880
E. R. H. E. R. R. I think
there's one are in the middle.

1398
01:19:03,881 --> 01:19:06,360
But yeah.

1399
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:08,590
Is there a, do you guys have any, uh,

1400
01:19:08,990 --> 01:19:13,560
just in closing ask or recommendation
of the people listening?

1401
01:19:14,700 --> 01:19:16,390
Um,
I would say the,

1402
01:19:16,940 --> 01:19:21,470
the reason that this podcast is
happening right now is because, uh,

1403
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:23,340
with that guy don hurts felt,

1404
01:19:23,350 --> 01:19:25,360
I mentioned there was one day where
I'm sitting there, I was like, God,

1405
01:19:25,361 --> 01:19:26,500
what I would do to talk to him.

1406
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:28,630
And then I just picked up the phone
and called my agent and was like,

1407
01:19:28,870 --> 01:19:33,010
can you get me don hurts fillets number.
And I talked to him and it blew my mind.

1408
01:19:33,490 --> 01:19:36,220
And then I had the same thing
with a, this guy, Sam Harris,

1409
01:19:36,221 --> 01:19:39,700
who I look up to very much and
I look up and I just called him.

1410
01:19:39,730 --> 01:19:43,660
And so I reached out to you in the same
way and you write about this in your

1411
01:19:43,661 --> 01:19:44,590
book as well.

1412
01:19:44,591 --> 01:19:48,070
And I just think if you idolize someone
or you look up to someone or you respect

1413
01:19:48,071 --> 01:19:52,690
someone's work, try to get in touch with
them, it's, there's no harm. And so far,

1414
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:54,790
I'm three for three and I have
an advantageous position. Yeah.

1415
01:19:54,810 --> 01:19:58,740
With an agent and all of that
incredibly successful producer, writer,

1416
01:19:58,741 --> 01:20:02,070
director there.
There's like a,

1417
01:20:02,071 --> 01:20:05,720
there's some guy a named Jordan who I
ran into on the street who I email with

1418
01:20:05,810 --> 01:20:06,920
and he now works at funny or,

1419
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:10,740
and I keep them in mind and I
don't know this guy from anything.

1420
01:20:10,741 --> 01:20:14,250
He just came up to me one day on
the street and it's worth a shot.

1421
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:17,980
You never know. Well, this Jordan
Guy could kill me one. Yeah.

1422
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:23,560
[inaudible]

1423
01:20:24,870 --> 01:20:27,480
but uh, no, it's so true.
I mean some fans of mine,

1424
01:20:27,481 --> 01:20:30,540
if you reached out to Warren Buffet and
getting handwritten letters back from

1425
01:20:30,550 --> 01:20:33,030
them, you just never know.
Yeah. Well it's the same thing.

1426
01:20:33,031 --> 01:20:35,100
Like sometimes like Seth and
I always talk about this,

1427
01:20:35,101 --> 01:20:37,910
we'll find ourselves doing like an
interview or something and we look at each

1428
01:20:37,911 --> 01:20:41,010
other. We're like, why are we, when did
we agree to this? Why would we do this?

1429
01:20:41,430 --> 01:20:43,880
Sometimes people just drop
their guards and agree to shit.

1430
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:48,260
They should. Exactly. That's like
a wink wink at me at the moment.

1431
01:20:49,340 --> 01:20:51,470
I've been at whole movies.
I don't understand why

1432
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:56,910
you called the person on the one day where
there will is exhausted from whatever

1433
01:20:56,911 --> 01:20:57,610
else

1434
01:20:57,610 --> 01:20:58,660
and they're just like,
yeah man,

1435
01:20:58,661 --> 01:21:02,050
I'll meet with you as long as I can get
off this phone call right now. Yeah.

1436
01:21:02,051 --> 01:21:05,440
That's what I think too is just
just do it. I mean like Nike,

1437
01:21:05,650 --> 01:21:09,130
you meet so many people, Nike, I mean
Nike has the best tagline of all time,

1438
01:21:09,310 --> 01:21:14,050
but it's like we show when people talk
about writing movies and we did write a

1439
01:21:14,051 --> 01:21:15,850
movie and like,
you know,

1440
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:20,880
my wife wanted to make a movie and so
she raised $1 billion and made a movie.

1441
01:21:21,071 --> 01:21:25,090
Like it's not something that
is completely unachievable.

1442
01:21:25,091 --> 01:21:30,091
It's something that if you are somewhat
talented and have a lot of determination

1443
01:21:30,941 --> 01:21:35,230
and are willing to put yourself
out there and are willing to fail,

1444
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:39,370
then you can probably do
something more than nothing.

1445
01:21:40,460 --> 01:21:44,610
Neon Superbad was a success,
but like make no mistake for 10 years,

1446
01:21:44,611 --> 01:21:48,630
it was a failure and the
first five drafts, like if
you read them, you'd be like,

1447
01:21:48,631 --> 01:21:50,170
this is the worst thing
I've ever read in my life.

1448
01:21:50,510 --> 01:21:52,520
Let's over and over and over again.
Like,

1449
01:21:52,550 --> 01:21:54,200
I don't think anyone's gonna make this
movie. I don't think it was gonna be,

1450
01:21:54,201 --> 01:21:58,080
it was really, and like, it literally
didn't even occur to us to listen to them.

1451
01:21:58,360 --> 01:22:02,120
Like it wasn't even a conversation of
like, should we stop? Like, I literally,

1452
01:22:02,270 --> 01:22:05,270
we didn't even have that conversation
and was like, fuck those people.

1453
01:22:05,271 --> 01:22:06,830
Let's go to the next one.
You know,

1454
01:22:06,940 --> 01:22:09,210
Blake like to picture like
Stephen King writing his first

1455
01:22:09,270 --> 01:22:13,020
looking at me like, man, I'm
stumped. I'm going to go,

1456
01:22:13,021 --> 01:22:15,140
I'm going to go be something else.

1457
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:18,540
Can you just keep going
blind belief in yourself?

1458
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:26,280
Like it was turned down 26 or 27 times
also, I mean viciously like violently.

1459
01:22:26,281 --> 01:22:28,620
I have these like angry
sort of infuriated,

1460
01:22:28,621 --> 01:22:32,400
insulted letters from acquiring it
or just turn it down. All right guys.

1461
01:22:32,401 --> 01:22:34,740
Well let's, uh, I really
appreciate all the time.

1462
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:39,510
Let's wrap up and we can do that with
telling people where they can find more

1463
01:22:39,511 --> 01:22:43,650
about you guys, find you on
the social webs and so on.
If they want to say hi, we,

1464
01:22:43,651 --> 01:22:44,970
uh,
due to a film called the [inaudible]

1465
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:49,490
interview, we're not as active
on, we used to be pretty active.

1466
01:22:49,630 --> 01:22:53,920
Uh, I'm muck about on Twitter, a litter
a little in your Evan Goldberg. I'm,

1467
01:22:54,050 --> 01:22:54,883
I'm Evan Goldberg,

1468
01:22:55,450 --> 01:22:58,210
editor of Andy Goldberg or Evan.

1469
01:22:58,360 --> 01:23:01,330
I think it's just having to go over
just having goals for while. I will,

1470
01:23:01,331 --> 01:23:06,070
I will put it in the show notes
for everybody. Also, I'm Rogan on

1471
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:08,750
Twitter and that's Rogan
with an ear or with an e.

1472
01:23:11,150 --> 01:23:11,491
If you,

1473
01:23:11,491 --> 01:23:14,940
if you write a letter and put it under
the second o in the Hollywood sign or the

1474
01:23:14,941 --> 01:23:17,910
second l in the Hollywood sign.
Go up there.

1475
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:22,830
All right guys. Well thanks so much for
taking the time. I really appreciate it.

1476
01:23:22,950 --> 01:23:24,420

Hey guys, this is Tim again. Just a
few more things before you take off.

1481
01:23:40,860 --> 01:23:43,530
Number one,
this is five bullet Friday.

1482
01:23:43,650 --> 01:23:46,410
Do you want to get a short email from me?

email from me every Friday?

1484

That provides a little more soul of
fun before the weekend and five bullet

1485
01:23:53,551 --> 01:23:58,170
Friday is a very short email where I share
the coolest things I've found or that

1486
01:23:58,171 --> 01:23:59,790
I've been pondering over the week.

1487
01:23:59,970 --> 01:24:02,760
That could include favorite new
albums that I've discovered.

1488
01:24:02,761 --> 01:24:06,210
It could include Gizmos and gadgets
and all sorts of weird shit that I've

1489
01:24:06,211 --> 01:24:10,500
somehow dug up in the uh,
the world of the esoteric as I do.

1490
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:15,800
It could include favorite articles that
I've read and that I've shared with my

1491
01:24:16,471 --> 01:24:19,200
close friends for instance.
And it's very short.

1492
01:24:19,260 --> 01:24:24,260
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness
before you head off for the weekend.

1498
01:24:41,641 --> 01:24:43,800

travel with it to avoid getting sick.
