Hello Ladies and germs. This
is Tim Ferriss, otherwise
known as Faye you tongue,

24
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,800
but I'm not going to
ask you to call me that.

25
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:41,970
And this is another episode of the
Tim Ferriss Show where my job is to

26
00:01:41,971 --> 00:01:45,420
deconstruct world class
performers or teachers,

27
00:01:45,421 --> 00:01:50,421
oftentimes both in many different areas
and that could range from chess to

28
00:01:50,851 --> 00:01:53,280
sports to acting, to
government, to military.

29
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:58,490
And this time we have an incredible
meditative thinker and teacher,

30
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,790
uh, specifically in the Buddhist
tradition. So Tara Brock,

31
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,110
I have been looking forward to speaking
with Tara for many, many, many months.

32
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:12,120
Tara is a phd in clinical psychology and
one of the leading teachers of Buddhist

33
00:02:12,121 --> 00:02:14,580
thinking and meditation
in the Western World.

34
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,600
She is the founder of the insight
meditation community in Washington DC.

35
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,910
And her lectures,
which are fantastic.

36
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:24,390
Our downloaded hundreds of
thousands of times every month.

37
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,830
I was first introduced to Tara's work
by another guest on this podcast,

38
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,580
Maria Popova, who's amazing. You
should listen to her episode as well.

39
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,690
Soon thereafter,
looked like the universe was conspiring.

40
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:41,850
A friend who's also a neuroscience PhD
recommended her book radical acceptance.

41
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,860
She claimed it was life changing and all
of my red flags went up and it ended up

42
00:02:46,861 --> 00:02:50,250
exceeding all expectations. It really
had a profound impact on my life.

43
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:54,810
So it's my hope that this tactical
conversation offers you techniques for

44
00:02:54,811 --> 00:02:59,800
addressing all sorts of issues ranging
from loneliness, anger, hatred,

45
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:04,480
the quote trance of unworthiness
and quote and much more, uh,

46
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:07,330
Tara has had a meaningful
impact on my life.

47
00:03:07,331 --> 00:03:08,950
And of course I wish the same for you.

48
00:03:08,951 --> 00:03:11,800
That's why I invited her
to pee on the podcast.

49
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,340
And for those of you who know my
fondness for stoic philosophy,

50
00:03:15,341 --> 00:03:20,341
I think Tara's work and certain facets
of Buddhism in fact are a fantastic

51
00:03:21,011 --> 00:03:25,030
complement to all of my talking
and reading about Seneca,

52
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:28,510
Marcus Aurelius and the other favorites.
So without further ado,

53
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:33,750
please enjoy a conversation that I really
enjoyed and a wide ranging romp across

54
00:03:35,771 --> 00:03:39,040
all sorts of subjects and
topics with Tara Brock.

55
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,260
Tara,
welcome to the show.

56
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,950
I'm delighted to be with you,
Tim

57
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:52,490
and I am having a bit of Deja Vu all
over again is a one very wise man.

58
00:03:53,911 --> 00:03:57,060
Once said, because I've heard so
many of your guided meditations,

59
00:03:57,061 --> 00:04:02,050
it's surreal to be talking to you live.
I do. Do you get that a lot? Do you had,

60
00:04:02,051 --> 00:04:05,730
do you have people come up to you and
have to do a double take with your voice

61
00:04:05,731 --> 00:04:08,460
or people recognize you in restaurants
because they've heard your guided

62
00:04:08,461 --> 00:04:09,294
meditations?

63
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:13,090
Yeah. That and they'll say, oh, you
look so much littler than I thought

64
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,310
and then I'll start speaking and they'll
go into a kind of hypnotic trance.

65
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:26,530
I've been introduced to you through many
different people and eventually almost

66
00:04:27,261 --> 00:04:30,440
in the same way that meditation kind
of knocked on my door until I finally

67
00:04:30,441 --> 00:04:32,270
answered.
Uh,

68
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:37,780
Maria Popova who runs a site called
brain pickings is just just one of my

69
00:04:38,451 --> 00:04:41,870
favorite people and brought you
up on this podcast. In fact,

70
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:44,210
and then a number of my other friends,

71
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:49,040
a friend named Olivia who also brought
you up and it just got to the point where

72
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:50,860
specifically,
uh,

73
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:56,090
your guided meditations and radical
acceptance head been introduced into my,

74
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:01,220
my life or my slipstream my consciousness.
So many different ways.

75
00:05:01,221 --> 00:05:06,221
I felt like perhaps it was time for me
to sit down and take a look at things at.

76
00:05:07,101 --> 00:05:07,671
So first off,

77
00:05:07,671 --> 00:05:10,610
I wanted to just thank you for the work
that you do because it's had a very

78
00:05:10,611 --> 00:05:15,611
positive impact on my life and based
on the response of my audience on many

79
00:05:17,211 --> 00:05:20,900
people who are likely listening to
this, this interview. So first off,

80
00:05:20,901 --> 00:05:21,950
I just wanted to thank you for that.

81
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:26,900
Thank you. I appreciate hearing
it and it's very neutral,

82
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,430
but I won't go there right this moment,
but thank you for how much you're,

83
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:34,550
what you're doing ripples out.
Yeah.

84
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:38,620
It's just every everyday. Yeah.
Slogging along in my own way,

85
00:05:38,621 --> 00:05:43,310
although if people could see it, sometimes
I think how the sausage is made. I,

86
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:46,840
uh, I, I not so much worry,
but part of the reason I,

87
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:51,940
I usually decline journalists want to
follow me around for three to five days.

88
00:05:51,941 --> 00:05:52,391
I'm like,

89
00:05:52,391 --> 00:05:55,660
you might be envisioning something
that is very different from my reality.

90
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,710
I think you see me like snowboarding
in the Alps and then taking, uh,

91
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,810
taking some type of zip line,

92
00:06:02,811 --> 00:06:07,400
like into a bathtub where I'm reciting
poetry or whatever the image might be.

93
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:08,560
I have no idea what the images,

94
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,900
I'm like most of the time it
looks like I'm just sitting there,

95
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,240
I know can be awful ordinary
from the inside out.

96
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,720
Extraordinary pose.
So I was,

97
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,860
I was hoping we might
start, uh, where, uh, where,

98
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,830
where things began,
uh,

99
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:31,870
and to rewind the clock a little bit and
just give people a retrospective of how

100
00:06:32,511 --> 00:06:33,560
you got to,

101
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,340
to the point where you're
teaching Buddhist meditation
and mindfulness and so on.

102
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:44,330
Um, and I have a little
bit of the background from
radical acceptance and having

103
00:06:44,331 --> 00:06:48,230
read that, but for those people
who were unfamiliar with your work,

104
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,360
maybe you could give just a brief,
uh,

105
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,780
a brief overview of your background.

106
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,600
But I think that'd be a
helpful place to start. Right?

107
00:06:55,890 --> 00:07:00,600
Sure. Well, if I go back, you
know, more to the teams, you know,

108
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,580
I was completely,

109
00:07:02,581 --> 00:07:07,581
I remember when I first went to a class
on comparative religion and you know,

110
00:07:09,451 --> 00:07:11,520
we've got a whole mess of them introduced.

111
00:07:11,521 --> 00:07:16,521
And I decided that Buddhism was at the
very bottom of my list because it just

112
00:07:17,191 --> 00:07:19,730
like, you know, why would
I want to give up desire?

113
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:23,970
I was a total heat and nest and I love
my desires, you know, whether it was,

114
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:29,280
you know, nature and athletics
or drugs or sex or parties,

115
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:32,250
you know, it's like, why give
up desire? And it wasn't,

116
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:36,840
it was about another five
years until I got it.

117
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,790
But that wasn't the message. It wasn't
give up desire. It was, you know, not be,

118
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:46,560
not have that desire to be a tyrant over
your life, you know, not be possessed.

119
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,620
But, so I, I was, uh, you know,

120
00:07:49,621 --> 00:07:54,150
just a thrill seeking and also type A,
kind of a,

121
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,750
uh, teen, very hardworking
and hard playing.

122
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,850
And where was this?

123
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:03,630
I grew up in Montclair, New Jersey and a,

124
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,940
which we all called the hub
of the universe because it
seemed like the center of

125
00:08:06,941 --> 00:08:07,774
everything.

126
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:12,790
And then I went into college thinking
I was going to be a lawyer and when I

127
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:16,240
graduated I moved right into an Ashram.
So something happened in there.

128
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:23,260
Nothing happened. I'm so curious.
I mean, what triggered that?

129
00:08:23,261 --> 00:08:27,040
Was it a conversation, their
particular movie or book? I mean,

130
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:30,910
how did you go from preparing to
be a lawyer to going to an Ashram?

131
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:35,980
Well, I got, there are a
number of influence as part of,
it's the times, you know, I,

132
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:38,220
I went to college and it was,
um,

133
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,260
social activism and I was very antiwar,

134
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:45,650
very involved with left wing
politics and the kinds of,

135
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:48,400
the Combo of that with,
um,

136
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:53,000
psychedelics combined with,
uh, just the whole, you know,

137
00:08:53,001 --> 00:08:57,560
coming to the east east,
coming to the west and introducing yoga.

138
00:08:57,561 --> 00:09:01,650
I began to do yoga in my junior
or senior year in college.

139
00:09:01,651 --> 00:09:05,830
And my reality shifted. Tim,
you know, it's like, um,

140
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:10,970
I was still, I had a, I've
always had an interest in, uh,

141
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,790
you know, learning and academics
to some degree, but I was like,

142
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,540
I was passionate about discovering,
you know,

143
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,870
what is the nature of the universe,
what is reality?

144
00:09:21,871 --> 00:09:25,350
And I've always fascinated the psyche,
like how do these minds work?

145
00:09:25,351 --> 00:09:28,470
So I knew that somehow I knew,

146
00:09:28,471 --> 00:09:33,300
I just had kind of had to give
myself to that. So when I graduated,

147
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:36,690
um, I went to what's called
the summer solstice gathering.

148
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,480
It was a big yoga meditation gathering and

149
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,840
there was just this experience that,
um,

150
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:49,040
there was a mystery that
was so much bigger than the
world that I normally lived

151
00:09:50,251 --> 00:09:52,890
in, that that was the
thing to commit myself to.

152
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:57,780
So I really literally went from college
right into an Ashram community and

153
00:09:57,781 --> 00:10:00,570
Ashrams, uh, for those that are,
are listening, I don't know, it's a,

154
00:10:00,571 --> 00:10:04,830
it's a spiritual community where
practice yoga and meditation,

155
00:10:04,831 --> 00:10:09,831
we'd get up at three 30 in the morning
and start with a cold shower as the first

156
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:13,870
beginning of the day was just
getting into it, cold shower.

157
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,820
And then doing

158
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:22,340
a lot of very vigorous yoga and
chanting and meditation and you know,

159
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:27,160
after a few hours I identified
the day feeling, uh,

160
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:30,100
just absolutely ablaze with,
you know,

161
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:35,320
both energy and also very,
very peaceful and happy.

162
00:10:35,321 --> 00:10:37,330
And then during the
day, because, you know,

163
00:10:37,331 --> 00:10:41,170
I carried all my type a
stuff into Osram list,

164
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:44,650
I would either just, I
was kind of, Oh, you know,

165
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:47,390
we're a pretty driven Yogi player.

166
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:53,680
You've got it. It's amazing.
We all, we do that. We,

167
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:59,400
I've seen pretty much everyone I know
get into spiritual life or spiritual

168
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,011
practice,

169
00:11:00,011 --> 00:11:04,540
but bring all their normal
egoic neurotic stuff into it.

170
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:10,390
So I did that and I, I remember,

171
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,210
I mean we all have different
ways of doing it. For me,

172
00:11:13,211 --> 00:11:18,100
I had this idea that if I
worked really hard at it,

173
00:11:18,101 --> 00:11:22,570
I could get enlightened and six or seven
years and I have no idea where I got

174
00:11:22,571 --> 00:11:27,290
that number. That was my, you know, I just
kinda figured I really throw myself in.

175
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:32,080
And so I would sometimes go
to different teachers and say,

176
00:11:32,081 --> 00:11:35,630
well, so what else can I do? Cause
you know, I was a pretty, you know,

177
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:39,910
I was going at it like as a group, we
would get up at three 30 in the morning,

178
00:11:39,911 --> 00:11:44,250
but I'd often get up at two 30 so
I can get a little extra. And, and,

179
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:48,190
and I don't say this by the way, with
pride. I mean, I was, you know, I've,

180
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:52,960
I've learned since then, but, um, so
I'd asked this question, you know,

181
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:56,770
what else can I do?
And to a tee,

182
00:11:56,771 --> 00:12:01,000
the response would be just
relax. And then I go, oh,

183
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,740
just relax. And that would become my
next, you know, practice. No, it's,

184
00:12:04,741 --> 00:12:05,730
I'm going to do this now.

185
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:08,970
You're going to wake up 30
minutes earlier to relax.

186
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,320
Exactly. Right. Exactly right.
It's like race, race, race
to get there and wait. But,

187
00:12:13,321 --> 00:12:15,760
you know. Anyway, so that was kind of, um,

188
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,690
those were my earliest
years in the Ashram.

189
00:12:18,691 --> 00:12:23,691
I was pretty driven and trying really
hard to purify and become a better person.

190
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,610
And, um, you know,

191
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:32,710
I got drawn both because I intuited,

192
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:34,800
you know,
this,

193
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:39,950
this mystery and two did a kind of love
that really was possible to and have it

194
00:12:41,941 --> 00:12:44,970
in an express and an
awareness that was very vast.

195
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:50,340
And I also was drawn because I wanted
to become a better person and I,

196
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,480
I spent a lot of my earlier years
feeling like I wasn't enough,

197
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:57,540
I needed to be better.

198
00:12:57,541 --> 00:13:02,541
So it was also kind of a hot self
improvement project at the same time.

199
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,230
How did you feel you weren't good enough?

200
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:10,190
Or what were the things
you hoped to improve?

201
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:13,440
Well,

202
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,140
cause I'm a head case about this stuff,
so this is not a,

203
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:20,350
this is not me talking
down. Um, in any way. I,

204
00:13:20,351 --> 00:13:25,150
I struggle with a lot of
these, uh, I think issues.

205
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,030
So I'm asking this as much
for myself as anyone else.

206
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,070
Yeah, yeah. Well, um,

207
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,110
I've come to call it the trance
of unworthiness in retrospect. Um,

208
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,370
and I, I, I like talking about it cause I,

209
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:41,730
I feel like most everyone,
I know it's,

210
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:46,740
it feels like a pervasive suffering in
our culture that we have this sense that

211
00:13:47,251 --> 00:13:50,120
we should be better, that
we're, you know, there's a,

212
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:54,700
there's a cartoon I love with this dog
on a psychiatrist's couch. Anything,

213
00:13:55,380 --> 00:14:00,090
it's always good dog this and good
dog that, but is it ever great dog?

214
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,310
It does, doesn't it? Yeah.
So, so, um, I text her myself.

215
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:10,770
I was,
um,

216
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:16,130
I think the biggest areas of feeling
unworthy or not good enough was a sense of

217
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:22,200
being selfish or self centered.
Like in some way my own needs come first.

218
00:14:22,201 --> 00:14:23,790
Then also ceiling.

219
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,930
I remember in high school and first years
of college being out of control with

220
00:14:27,931 --> 00:14:32,220
my eating and feeling
overweight and being really,

221
00:14:32,221 --> 00:14:36,040
really ashamed of that. So
I felt that was, you know,

222
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:37,530
something is wrong with me there.

223
00:14:37,531 --> 00:14:41,340
And then I just in some
way was falling short,

224
00:14:41,341 --> 00:14:45,270
whether it was as a friend
or a daughter or whatever.

225
00:14:45,271 --> 00:14:50,271
And I had a lot of insecurity about
and I would just very driven to seek.

226
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:56,610
And so I could see the different
ways that it played out. But, um,

227
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,340
it was definitely the core
sense of I'm not good enough.

228
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,121
And that,

229
00:15:02,121 --> 00:15:07,121
that really became the seed of writing
radical acceptance was both through my

230
00:15:08,631 --> 00:15:11,270
own experience of not enough.

231
00:15:11,271 --> 00:15:15,800
And then as a psychologist
and as a spiritual teacher,

232
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,590
just seeing the torment,

233
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:23,680
like how many people are not
able to enjoy their moments.

234
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:28,070
Cause in some way there's a
sense of something's wrong.

235
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:32,430
And I'll share with you one
story that really hit me. Um,

236
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:37,540
and I think it's in radical acceptance
of a woman who was in a coma and her

237
00:15:38,601 --> 00:15:43,580
daughter was by her daughter told
me this story and she was dying.

238
00:15:43,581 --> 00:15:45,290
And at one point she,

239
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:50,560
her kind of eyes bolted
open and she looked at her
daughter in the eye and said,

240
00:15:50,781 --> 00:15:54,470
you know, all my life, I thought
something was wrong with me.

241
00:15:56,210 --> 00:16:00,950
And then she closed her eyes and that
was it. That was her last word. She,

242
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:05,960
she died after that. And for my
friends for this young, for the woman,

243
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:11,290
it was kind of a parting gift
because she realized just how,

244
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,193
um,

245
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:17,060
how sad it is to spend so many
moments at war with ourselves.

246
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:22,190
And, and, and part of when I teach
about the trance of unworthiness,

247
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:27,380
we can start to see how,
if we're really not trusting ourselves,

248
00:16:27,381 --> 00:16:28,910
if we're filled with self doubt,

249
00:16:28,911 --> 00:16:32,250
it's very hard to feel
intimate with other people. Um,

250
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:36,470
there's always a sense that,
yeah, it's like they'll find out.

251
00:16:36,471 --> 00:16:41,471
It's like if I'm right now talking to
you and I feel like there's this core

252
00:16:42,171 --> 00:16:43,310
deficiency,

253
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:47,980
it means I won't be able to
be spontaneous or, you know,

254
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:51,710
respond with tenderness.
It's like there's always a defendant mess.

255
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,670
So anyway,
that's a long way around saying that,

256
00:16:55,671 --> 00:17:00,260
that that became very clear
to me. Um, and, and you know,

257
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:04,250
at the end of college and then
beginning of living in an ashram that,

258
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:08,420
that I really wanted to, in some
way, I needed to be friend myself.

259
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,130
That became a very clear thing. It wasn't,
it wasn't just a psychological thing.

260
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:16,550
It's very much a part of
spiritual awakening that I,

261
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:18,890
that I needed to really be friend.
This life.

262
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,900
When you were having this Ostrom
experience, when did things change?

263
00:17:26,901 --> 00:17:28,140
When did you leave the room?

264
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:34,190
You know, I was the Ashram, the
strengths and the positive aspects where,

265
00:17:34,191 --> 00:17:38,510
you know, it made it very easily to
have a very regular strong practice.

266
00:17:38,511 --> 00:17:42,260
And you had, the Nice thing
about having group of people,

267
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:45,580
and I really recommend this to
all of us, is that it's, you know,

268
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:49,950
to periodically be able to practice with
other people and exchange what's going

269
00:17:49,951 --> 00:17:50,784
on.

270
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:55,860
That sense of community
can keep on nourishing and,

271
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:59,670
and enlivening, uh, what's
going on in terms of awakening.

272
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:04,920
And the Ashram had a lot of rigidity
to it. Tim, it was, you know,

273
00:18:04,921 --> 00:18:09,921
I joined when I was 21 and I came from
this very kind of liberal background.

274
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,870
I was very independent and yet I joined
something that had quite a hierarchy.

275
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,210
It was very patriarchal.

276
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,480
It was really very different from
what I would have thought for myself.

277
00:18:21,481 --> 00:18:26,481
And gradually those qualities as
the kind of rigidity just made it.

278
00:18:26,911 --> 00:18:30,180
So I needed to continue
on the spiritual path,

279
00:18:30,181 --> 00:18:35,160
but not inside the mushroom
environment. So I laughed. Right.

280
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:36,870
Um,
I left,

281
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,950
I stayed for 10 years and
I had an arranged marriage.

282
00:18:40,951 --> 00:18:44,970
Is that something that's not so
difficult in the last, you know,

283
00:18:44,971 --> 00:18:49,620
I too have, you know, had
all the normal learning to,

284
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:50,483
you know,

285
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:55,020
fall in love and prince in shining armor
and get married and instead I, you know,

286
00:18:55,021 --> 00:18:59,390
I was assigned to my husband and, um, um,

287
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:02,190
I don't know if I should
speed over that one or not.

288
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:05,170
Uh, you know, we might, I
might come back to that.

289
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:09,260
You can please continue and then
we might come back to that. Okay.

290
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:15,730
Um, so, you know, so I went along
with a lot of stuff because,

291
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,361
you know,
again,

292
00:19:16,361 --> 00:19:21,361
I was having very intense altered states
of experience that were very lovely and

293
00:19:23,231 --> 00:19:26,680
it's learned to concentrate
my mind and you know,

294
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:31,590
had a lot of devotional
experiences and so on, but the,

295
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,290
but the structure and the
authoritarianism of the,

296
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:39,980
of the community got to me. And, um, so,

297
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,180
so I left after 10 years and,
um,

298
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:47,980
and then right after leaving
got pregnant and had my son Ryan

299
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,830
and is,
if you wouldn't mind that them,

300
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:56,290
there's one particular story about
the honest truth. I mean this, this,

301
00:19:56,890 --> 00:20:01,090
this being called out, uh, Oh
yeah, group setting that I think,

302
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:04,470
I mean it really struck me as

303
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:10,720
a turning point perhaps where, uh,
an important event at the very least,

304
00:20:10,721 --> 00:20:14,130
if you wouldn't mind
describing that. Uh, yeah.

305
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:16,360
Add some context as well.

306
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:20,150
Sure, sure. Um, yeah. Are,

307
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:23,990
I had been trying to get
pregnant, you know, and,

308
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,910
and really eager to have a child.

309
00:20:25,911 --> 00:20:30,700
And I finally got pregnant and I
went to a gathering, you know, we,

310
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:35,540
we would gather for about
a month in the mountains.

311
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:38,450
And I remember it was very,

312
00:20:38,451 --> 00:20:42,710
very hot and it was very
rigorous activity at our,

313
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:45,230
our gatherings.
And I miscarried.

314
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:50,800
And so I wrote a note to the
spiritual leader of the community,

315
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:56,500
um, and, and basically said, you know,

316
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,950
we might want to warn some people
that if you're pregnant this,

317
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:02,620
you're in this kind of heat and this,
you know, it might not be a good idea.

318
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:06,610
And I think that that must have made
him feel like I was saying, well,

319
00:21:06,611 --> 00:21:10,190
your teaching something about your
teachings caused me to Miss Kerrick.

320
00:21:10,191 --> 00:21:12,340
And which of course was saying,
but,

321
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:17,780
but I was in a group of several hundred
people when he had me stand up and he

322
00:21:18,161 --> 00:21:18,701
said,
you know,

323
00:21:18,701 --> 00:21:22,980
you're trying to blame your miscarriage
on such and such and you miscarried

324
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,300
because of your ego.
And he was very,

325
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:29,920
it was very crude and very,
it was abusive.

326
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:34,720
It was an abusive behavior to here I
was two days after a miscarriage too.

327
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,000
Um, you know, have me in
that vulnerable a place,

328
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,500
uh, be rated and that way. And so that,

329
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,260
and I'm glad you brought it
up because that, you know,

330
00:21:47,261 --> 00:21:51,280
I had already had a lot of
misgivings about Ostrom living,

331
00:21:51,281 --> 00:21:55,870
but his behavior made it
utterly clear to me that,

332
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:56,620
you know,

333
00:21:56,620 --> 00:22:01,060
I couldn't be part of something where the
leader with treat people in an abusive

334
00:22:01,061 --> 00:22:03,640
way.
And interestingly,

335
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:08,670
I have had no abuse or trauma on
that of any real sort in my history.

336
00:22:10,151 --> 00:22:15,151
I think if I had already been an abused
person and I'd already had trauma in my

337
00:22:15,221 --> 00:22:16,210
nervous system,

338
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:20,440
that it would have been much more
difficult for me to process that.

339
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,560
But as it happened,
um,

340
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:27,250
after that experience
for the hours after it,

341
00:22:27,251 --> 00:22:31,570
I remember going into a little,
um, kind of a chapel and,

342
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:36,580
and crying deeply, you know, the
humiliation of it, the pain of it,

343
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:39,370
heard of it, that kind of the
betrayal. Like how could somebody,

344
00:22:39,371 --> 00:22:41,650
I'd kind of trusted,
do that.

345
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:47,430
And then I got to a place where either
I became very clear to me that either I

346
00:22:48,431 --> 00:22:53,431
was going to in some way believe that
he knew something and use it against

347
00:22:56,861 --> 00:22:57,540
myself,

348
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:02,540
or I was going to absolutely get behind
myself in the sense of really dedicate

349
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,880
to embracing myself,

350
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:12,180
not to buy into some badness because it
could've easily played into the trance

351
00:23:12,521 --> 00:23:16,210
of unworthiness. It could have
been, it could have been the killer,

352
00:23:16,211 --> 00:23:18,910
could have been the nail to the coffin.
And,

353
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:22,960
but what it made clear to me is
that I really want, you know,

354
00:23:22,961 --> 00:23:27,961
that it was intrinsic to the spiritual
path to trust and embrace the life that's

355
00:23:28,061 --> 00:23:32,860
here. And that doesn't mean to him
that I felt like I, my ego, that I was,

356
00:23:32,861 --> 00:23:36,660
you know, ego free and that I didn't
make mistakes. And you know, I mean I'm,

357
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,810
I'm very,
very aware of all my imperfections.

358
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:46,520
It more meant that on some fundamental
level was going to trust my goodness.

359
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,640
And so it was a turning point because it
was after that betrayal that I chose to

360
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:00,950
really, I really committed myself
to accepting myself as I was. And,

361
00:24:00,951 --> 00:24:01,430
um,

362
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:06,430
since then I ran into this a
quote from Carl Rogers who says,

363
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:07,760
you know,

364
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:12,760
it wasn't until I accepted myself just
as I was that I was free to change.

365
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,360
I'm glad you brought that
up. I was actually going to
bring up that exact quote.

366
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:21,933
Oh really?

367
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:28,160
And we'll get to that just because
I've found it very challenging and I've

368
00:24:28,161 --> 00:24:29,570
talked to many friends about this,

369
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:35,020
the balancing of acceptance
versus productivity or the
acceptance versus being

370
00:24:40,131 --> 00:24:40,880
proactive.

371
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,760
And we'll come back to that because I
know this is something you've thought

372
00:24:43,761 --> 00:24:45,930
about before,
but uh,

373
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:50,870
the Ostrom then at that point is,
is a closed chapter of sorts.

374
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:51,950
So you embrace,

375
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:56,900
decide to do what many people perhaps
would not have done because of their

376
00:24:56,901 --> 00:24:59,480
background or circumstances,
which is really sad.

377
00:24:59,481 --> 00:25:01,310
And you see this a lot
in closed communities,

378
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:04,580
but you took the path
of sort of accepting,

379
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:09,610
trying to accept yourself as opposed
to accept this a negative version of

380
00:25:09,651 --> 00:25:13,850
yourself that had been reinforced by this,
this leader at that point.

381
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:17,900
Where did you go with your,
your studying and end or your teaching?

382
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:24,280
I left. I had been doing a lot of
teaching while I was in the Ashram,

383
00:25:24,281 --> 00:25:25,780
Yoga and meditation.

384
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,570
And I laughed and got very drawn.

385
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:35,350
My meditation kind of started shifting
and I got very drawn to Buddhist

386
00:25:35,351 --> 00:25:38,410
meditation,
which interestingly is,

387
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,350
if you think of a lot of the
yoga meditations is a very, um,

388
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:46,660
very much of a training and concentration.
And I,

389
00:25:46,661 --> 00:25:50,290
I suspect we'll get more into the
different kinds of meditation as we speak,

390
00:25:50,291 --> 00:25:51,124
but it,

391
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:56,180
it can really allow you to quiet
the mind and settle the mind and,

392
00:25:57,401 --> 00:26:01,810
and have access to
experiences of a lot of peace.

393
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:05,300
And, um, it's, it can be very, very, uh,

394
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:09,760
very profoundly pleasurable.
And the, and I love that,

395
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:12,490
but what it didn't teach
me was mindfulness,

396
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:18,090
which was really how to open up
into the present moment with a,

397
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:23,400
with a very kind of profound quality of
just simple acceptance and presence to

398
00:26:24,101 --> 00:26:26,170
really notice what's going on right here.

399
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:28,540
So I got drawn to Buddhism because that,

400
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:33,670
that capacity for mindful presence,
uh,

401
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,030
became more and more what drew me.

402
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:39,400
So after I left the Ashram,

403
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:43,710
I started reading and then
going to retreats. Um,

404
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:44,790
that were,

405
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:49,440
that were Buddhist meditation
retreats and they also had a child.

406
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:54,030
So it was, I was juggling juggling
a few different worlds there,

407
00:26:54,031 --> 00:26:55,380
but they came together.
Okay.

408
00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:01,000
And since I promise to come back
to it and arranged marriage,

409
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,940
I'd like to talk about this because,

410
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,930
and I want to hear your thoughts
on a couple of things, but uh,

411
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:12,520
so I've had conversations half jokingly,

412
00:27:12,521 --> 00:27:17,521
not totally jokingly with friends who
are say Indian and who have friends,

413
00:27:17,951 --> 00:27:20,680
who've had arranged
marriages and some of these,

414
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:25,710
these friends live in say New York City
and they have this paradox of choice

415
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:31,710
conundrum where whoever they're dating
however smart or attractive or kind and

416
00:27:32,351 --> 00:27:33,580
so on,
they might be,

417
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:38,530
they are passing so many people in the
street that they worry might be just a

418
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:41,260
little more attractive, a little
more of this, a little more that,

419
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:44,860
that they hop from one person to
the next to the next to the next in

420
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:48,910
relationships. And they will, if
I have a few drinks with them,

421
00:27:48,911 --> 00:27:49,900
sometimes they'll joke,
you know,

422
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:54,160
it'd be a lot easier if I just had an
arranged marriage because it would take

423
00:27:54,161 --> 00:27:56,590
the decision making out of it
on some level. Or you know,

424
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:59,410
perhaps my parents could say,
not this is the one person,

425
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:01,420
but here are the five people
you have to choose from.

426
00:28:01,421 --> 00:28:05,050
They're all really great
people. Take your pick. And I,

427
00:28:05,051 --> 00:28:09,640
I'd just love to hear how your arranged
marriage was arranged. Like what,

428
00:28:09,641 --> 00:28:11,760
what were the criteria?
How will,

429
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,970
how were you two paired and
just your general thoughts on,

430
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:18,340
uh,
on that entire experience.

431
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:23,500
Yeah. So maybe just to make a
broader comment that, you know,

432
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:28,560
for some people from some traditions,
it may well be that,

433
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:29,371
you know,

434
00:28:29,371 --> 00:28:34,140
given a handful of people that there
may be somebody in that handful that it

435
00:28:34,141 --> 00:28:36,510
really does work better for them.

436
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:41,340
And so it's Mrs not like a judgment
that culturally this is a bad,

437
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,700
a bad ritual, you know. But, um,

438
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:48,450
and in this particular
case, um, it happened,

439
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,460
I'd say a good number of times,

440
00:28:50,461 --> 00:28:54,840
maybe three quarters of the
marriages of the, you know,

441
00:28:54,841 --> 00:28:58,800
we were all in our twenties when we first
joined the ash from were arranged by

442
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:03,300
the head of the whole
organization. And, um,

443
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,700
and,
and so mine was,

444
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:10,760
and it was not done by any criteria
that any of us could ever think of.

445
00:29:11,611 --> 00:29:16,050
It was very much that,
um, he, there was a,

446
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:20,130
a man who lived in Canada and needed
his green card. That's what it was.

447
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:21,481
And they want to end,

448
00:29:21,481 --> 00:29:25,980
he was part of our larger community and
they wanted him to be able to move into

449
00:29:25,981 --> 00:29:27,510
the country and get a green card.

450
00:29:27,511 --> 00:29:31,530
And so they were looking for somebody
to match them with and they knew I was

451
00:29:31,531 --> 00:29:35,880
single and they, they made the
arrangement for me not only to marry him,

452
00:29:35,881 --> 00:29:40,620
but I had to leave where I was living,
which was Boston and come down to,

453
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:43,210
so it was,

454
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:48,570
it seemed in my mind to be absolutely
this crazy groundless pairing.

455
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:51,700
I couldn't imagine.
I mean,

456
00:29:51,701 --> 00:29:54,370
it was just so far from what
I ever imagined for myself.

457
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:59,950
And when I met him,
he was a perfectly nice person,

458
00:29:59,951 --> 00:30:02,260
but very,
very far from anybody.

459
00:30:02,261 --> 00:30:05,890
I would have naturally in my own
choosing have picked as a mate.

460
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:09,970
So it was, it was really, really rough.

461
00:30:09,971 --> 00:30:14,080
I was very upset by it.
I pleaded not to have to do it.

462
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:19,470
And ultimately it was my sense that well
to be dedicated to this path means to

463
00:30:21,311 --> 00:30:23,410
be,
to go along with this.

464
00:30:23,411 --> 00:30:27,820
That was somehow or rather how my mind
construed at that I needed to surrender.

465
00:30:27,821 --> 00:30:31,780
I needed to surrender my wants and,
and just do it.

466
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,640
And I'm still,

467
00:30:33,641 --> 00:30:38,641
and I can say right now and my current
state of mind kind of astonished that I

468
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:45,430
would have viewed it that way because
as I say, I came up from a very,

469
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:49,480
I came at a pretty independent thinking
people, but that's what happened.

470
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:54,370
And I married him and it turned out
that he was, as I said, a very, uh,

471
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:56,740
you know,
a wonderful,

472
00:30:56,741 --> 00:31:01,390
wonderful human and he considered
continues to be a dear friend and brother.

473
00:31:01,391 --> 00:31:06,130
I mean, he really is. He's very, we're
very much, we had a child together. We,

474
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,660
even though we divorced,
we co-parented and we're good friends.

475
00:31:10,661 --> 00:31:12,760
And I think Tim, that, you know,

476
00:31:12,761 --> 00:31:17,761
part of it is because we didn't fall in
love in a romantic way when we decided

477
00:31:17,931 --> 00:31:20,440
to divorce.
There wasn't the kind of um,

478
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:25,110
painful tearing apart that
brings up so much, you know,

479
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:29,710
anger and census of betrayal and so on.
We were able to,

480
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:32,680
we were able to move on together.

481
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:38,990
Yeah, you didn't have the right
word, but you didn't have that.

482
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,820
A lot of the components that
create the complexity and sort of,

483
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:50,550
I suppose one could say to
irrational anger and exaggerated, uh,

484
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:53,000
anger directed at the other
person just didn't exist.

485
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,600
Exactly. I mean, the
more attachment there is,

486
00:31:55,601 --> 00:32:00,050
the more the fallen that when we come
apart, the more, you know, pain and,

487
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:04,720
and feeling of, you know, vengefulness
and everything flies up. So no,

488
00:32:04,721 --> 00:32:05,554
it didn't have that.

489
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:11,190
So I'd love to talk about meditation
and mindfulness and we'll get to that

490
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:15,520
looking at the different
types of meditation.

491
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:21,010
But I'd love to ask you a
couple of questions that are
just on my mind right now.

492
00:32:21,011 --> 00:32:25,870
So you mentioned enjoying the d,
The desires,

493
00:32:25,871 --> 00:32:30,190
the sex, the drugs, the this, the that,
which all sounds pretty fun quite frankly.

494
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:35,140
Uh,
is it possible to be a mindful hedonist?

495
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,570
And if so,
is that a bad thing?

496
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,230
Mindful sheepness

497
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:44,210
that should be my next
one. Fuck. I like it.

498
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:51,220
I think it's possible to take
tremendous pleasure in this world.

499
00:32:51,561 --> 00:32:56,290
In fact, you know, when one teacher says,
why six sate your desire on one thing,

500
00:32:56,291 --> 00:32:58,490
I'm not just desire it all.
And,

501
00:32:58,491 --> 00:33:03,380
and the more we're in that kind of
receptivity where there's just an amazing

502
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:07,990
appreciation for the simplest
things for everything. Um,

503
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:12,650
actually there's a lot of freedom in that
because there's not a lot of clenching

504
00:33:12,651 --> 00:33:17,651
and holding on and having to control
where the idea of mindful hedonism could

505
00:33:20,001 --> 00:33:25,001
fall on its face is if we become
attached to the particular current,

506
00:33:25,431 --> 00:33:29,330
if he didn't as him being a
certain way. So, you know,

507
00:33:29,331 --> 00:33:32,930
if we become attached to always
having a certain food and then it,

508
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:37,400
and then we ended up getting addicted
or we get attached to a certain chemical

509
00:33:37,401 --> 00:33:41,930
substance and it then becomes harmful
for our body or we take hedonistic

510
00:33:41,931 --> 00:33:44,780
pleasure and dealing
with one person sexually,

511
00:33:44,781 --> 00:33:48,500
but then it turns out that it
doesn't work out with that person.

512
00:33:48,501 --> 00:33:53,501
So if you see what I mean when there's
attachment and it's a tight holding,

513
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,440
it actually causes a sunburn.

514
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:58,120
Totally,
totally agreed.

515
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:04,400
I have a friend who
uses hedonistic as this.

516
00:34:04,401 --> 00:34:08,840
He says it was the sort of bitter
cutting edge to his voice is a very close

517
00:34:08,841 --> 00:34:13,180
friend. I won't name them,
but I think that it's, it's a,

518
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:16,030
it's kind of got a bad rap.
I mean, not to say that, uh,

519
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:19,580
that everyone should aspire to be. He
knows. But I think that there's a, also,

520
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:23,090
from,
from my own experience at least,

521
00:34:23,091 --> 00:34:26,870
and just looking at modern
technologically enabled culture,

522
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:30,970
there is a, there appears
to be a disconnect, uh,

523
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:36,670
where a lot of human beings do not
know how to enjoy a sensual pleasures.

524
00:34:38,871 --> 00:34:41,900
And by that I don't mean purely
sex. Like they don't, they don't,

525
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,980
they don't feel at home in their own
bodies. They don't walk around barefoot.

526
00:34:45,981 --> 00:34:50,981
They don't have these types of sensory
experiences that it can be so rich.

527
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:55,130
Uh, and uh, that's,

528
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,760
I feel like the baby just kind of gets
thrown out with the bath water a lot.

529
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:03,820
And I'd be curious to hear how you might
recommend someone experience pleasures

530
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,230
without developing a harmful attachments.
For instance,

531
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:11,150
before we started recording,

532
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:15,080
I was chatting with you a little
bit about fasting and, uh,

533
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:20,140
I've been experimenting with
fasting partially just to
prove to myself that I am

534
00:35:21,771 --> 00:35:25,280
self sufficient and conserved
five fasting. I mean, it's a very,

535
00:35:25,281 --> 00:35:29,600
it's been a very empowering
experience for me. And, uh,

536
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:34,250
similarly I did an experiment with
my audience a few months ago, um,

537
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,670
called Knob nom,
which I got a lot of grief for,

538
00:35:38,671 --> 00:35:42,210
but it meant a no booze,
no masturbation for 30 days.

539
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:46,380
And so we had about 10,000 people do this
experiment and it was very empowering

540
00:35:46,381 --> 00:35:50,370
for everyone involved. Even those
who didn't make it the full 30 days.

541
00:35:50,371 --> 00:35:55,371
But aside from these intermittent
periods of abstinence sees experiments.

542
00:35:56,551 --> 00:36:01,551
So there are other ways or practices that
help someone not develop attachment to

543
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,250
uh,

544
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:08,430
I suppose anything but certain pleasures
certainly would fall in that category.

545
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:10,260
Yeah,
it's,

546
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:15,200
it's a wonderful question because
really if we look at our lives, um,

547
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:21,450
where they're suffering, if we're
not happy and if we're not at home,

548
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:25,350
it's really because of the sense
of I want things different.

549
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:30,120
I want more. There's not enough
here. And that's attachments.

550
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:34,800
Like I have to have more. It's
have to have feeling. And so,

551
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:35,820
um,

552
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:40,820
my experience is that the more we actually
are in the moment and in the census,

553
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,330
like right here,
right now,

554
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:49,890
the more we decondition grasping.

555
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,420
So the very training of cause
this grass when it comes,

556
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:59,340
like you have something and then you have
the idea that you need to have more to

557
00:36:59,341 --> 00:37:00,174
be happy.

558
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:05,840
But if you actually let go of the
idea and just experience directly,

559
00:37:07,501 --> 00:37:11,250
contact the center, the pleasure in
the moment, and just notice that.

560
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:14,540
And then if there's this arising
of a sense of wanting more,

561
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:18,000
you just notice that and then you
come back right to your body. Again.

562
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:23,690
It's staying in the moment that actually
interrupts the chain reaction that

563
00:37:25,111 --> 00:37:29,490
leads to grasping on to things.
But that takes practice them.

564
00:37:29,491 --> 00:37:30,990
I mean it's like for most people,

565
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:36,410
as soon as we have the first
few spoons of ice cream,

566
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:38,160
um,

567
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:43,160
it's kind of like we forget and we just
spoon it in and we don't taste until at

568
00:37:44,041 --> 00:37:46,830
the end there's something lingering
and then we have to have more.

569
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:49,290
And there's already,
we're already leaning into the future.

570
00:37:49,291 --> 00:37:51,750
So to stay with each bite,

571
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:56,780
there's actually a fulfillment in it and
we don't go down that track of having

572
00:37:58,411 --> 00:37:59,244
to have.

573
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:04,210
Right. And it's, it's, uh,
I'm glad you mentioned the,

574
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:09,370
the eating. Um, my girlfriend
has done, as I mentioned before,

575
00:38:09,371 --> 00:38:11,840
we get started, a
massive fan of yours, uh,

576
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:15,160
has done quite a bit with
women with eating disorders.

577
00:38:15,161 --> 00:38:17,020
And I know you spent a lot
of time thinking about this,

578
00:38:17,021 --> 00:38:22,021
but she's had a lot of success with
her past clients simply saying,

579
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:24,970
you're allowed to eat
whatever you want to eat,

580
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:30,120
but you have to really enjoy it and focus
on the experience of eating that food.

581
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:34,990
And just by not forcing,
but facilitating that.

582
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:40,800
A lot of those people didn't
go on autopilot and consume
the 12th scoops instead

583
00:38:40,871 --> 00:38:45,010
of one, for instance. And, uh, the,

584
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:49,390
the, um, she's trying to stop me from
drinking wine last night and she said,

585
00:38:49,391 --> 00:38:51,440
you're allowed to have another glass,
but I want you to think about it.

586
00:38:51,441 --> 00:38:56,080
At first I was like, oh,
you got me. Uh, anyway,

587
00:38:56,081 --> 00:39:00,550
but the, uh, it was a very nice
sons here in, in, in my defense.

588
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:05,590
But the, yeah, I'm, I'm getting, I'm
going off the rails here. Let me,

589
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:09,550
let me steer my, my, uh, my
thinking back on track. Um,

590
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:15,250
one of the challenges that I have
is, uh, for instance, anger. Uh,

591
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:19,990
this is, I've, I've been rewarded
in life for a lot of, I feel,

592
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:24,670
uh, aggression, sort of bull
in a China shop type of,

593
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:29,080
uh,
aggression sounds very,

594
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:32,320
has a negative connotation,
but being, being very,

595
00:39:32,321 --> 00:39:37,180
very proactive with trying to accomplish
the things that I set out before me,

596
00:39:37,181 --> 00:39:40,150
whatever those things might be.
And a,

597
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:44,320
maybe a side effect of that is a lot
of anger directed at myself directed at

598
00:39:44,321 --> 00:39:47,530
other people. And I'd love for
you to talk about it. This was,

599
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:52,270
this was something that I just really,
when I talk about radical acceptance,

600
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:56,140
this is one of the examples I bring up,
or one of the stories.

601
00:39:56,141 --> 00:39:59,200
Could you talk about Maura
and inviting Mara to tea?

602
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:04,810
I'd love to be, can I ask you a
question about the anger? Sure. Yeah.

603
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:08,980
Do you feel like it causes you suffering?
And if so,

604
00:40:08,981 --> 00:40:10,900
how do you notice it as suffering?

605
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:13,450
Because I get that you've
gotten rewards for aggression.

606
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:18,080
Yeah. Uh, and, and I'm not, the
answer is yes, absolutely suffering,

607
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:20,780
which is part of the reason that,

608
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:26,440
that I finally started attempting to
meditate regularly and I've done a fairly

609
00:40:27,081 --> 00:40:31,610
good job, uh, was because I
recognize the suffering was not,

610
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:35,660
not only undesirable on so many levels,

611
00:40:35,661 --> 00:40:39,620
but unsustainable. I
mean, it was, it was, uh,

612
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:43,940
and I'm not the person who came up with
this, this was analogy, but, uh, the,

613
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:44,871
you know,

614
00:40:44,871 --> 00:40:49,871
the acid hurts the vessel that is storing
it more than anything that it happens

615
00:40:50,451 --> 00:40:51,261
to be poured upon.

616
00:40:51,261 --> 00:40:54,860
And I was just carrying around this acid
all the time and I recognized it wasn't,

617
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:59,930
it wasn't a sustainable, um, it
wasn't sustainable in any way.

618
00:40:59,931 --> 00:41:03,110
So yes, definitely suffering. Uh,

619
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:07,570
I'm never good enough for myself
ever. Uh, for instance, I mean, I end,

620
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:09,110
and this is,

621
00:41:09,111 --> 00:41:13,130
this is where I have so much trouble
because I won't mention names here,

622
00:41:13,131 --> 00:41:17,960
but for I'll give you just the type of
anecdote that on one hand people could

623
00:41:17,961 --> 00:41:20,940
say is ridiculous. On the other hand,
I really enjoy, and maybe this is,

624
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:25,660
you can read into my pathology
here. Uh, so there, there,

625
00:41:25,661 --> 00:41:29,870
there's a very famous tech entrepreneur
who is a billionaire several times over

626
00:41:29,871 --> 00:41:33,170
and he was playing chess with
a very well known competitor.

627
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:37,100
One point and this billionaire lost.

628
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:42,080
And he stood up and swiped all the pieces
off the board and kind of stormed off.

629
00:41:42,081 --> 00:41:45,410
And the other guy said, wow, you're
really, you're really bad at losing.

630
00:41:45,411 --> 00:41:49,190
And he said, show me a good loser
and I'll show you a fucking loser.

631
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:52,850
And now that's a very,
uh,

632
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:57,500
that's a very exaggerated example perhaps.

633
00:41:57,530 --> 00:42:01,100
But I mean, if you look at some of my
favorite movies, right? Like miracle,

634
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:03,230
which is a Disney movie, but
it's amazing. It's about the,

635
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:06,470
the US hockey team when they,
they were the,

636
00:42:06,471 --> 00:42:10,970
I think expected to be number 16th or
17th and made it all the way to the gold

637
00:42:10,971 --> 00:42:14,180
medal match against the Soviets, who at
the time were thought to be invincible.

638
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,830
And just the,
the,

639
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:21,340
the extreme nature of the training and
the pushing and how hard they had to push

640
00:42:23,161 --> 00:42:26,090
to even make that remotely possible
is attractive to me. Right?

641
00:42:26,091 --> 00:42:30,680
And so as a competitor, and I'm going
on a little long winded it bit here,

642
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:35,681
but I was always taught and in fact maybe
I just taught myself that like second

643
00:42:35,961 --> 00:42:37,580
place is first loser,
right?

644
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:41,870
Like I would rather be last place than
second place because second place means

645
00:42:41,871 --> 00:42:46,210
you tried really, really, really, really
hard but just not hard enough. You,

646
00:42:46,211 --> 00:42:50,990
you tried like 2% less than the person
who got the gold metal metal and no one

647
00:42:50,991 --> 00:42:53,360
remembers the silver medalist ever.
So

648
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:56,040
let me ask you a question about that then.

649
00:42:56,041 --> 00:42:58,260
If you had a step back
and look at your life,

650
00:42:58,290 --> 00:43:03,290
what is the most important place that
you would want to win a gold medal?

651
00:43:03,421 --> 00:43:06,990
I mean, if you really think at the
end of your life, looking back,

652
00:43:06,991 --> 00:43:10,860
if you could be the
very best in something,

653
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:14,880
it's just like what?
What do you most want to be best at?

654
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:19,350
I would say,
um,

655
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,300
creating learners who
are better than I am.

656
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:28,990
And if I do that,

657
00:43:28,991 --> 00:43:33,991
I feel like I can create a benevolent
army of part you tens of thousands,

658
00:43:36,821 --> 00:43:37,870
maybe hundreds of thousands,

659
00:43:37,871 --> 00:43:42,871
maybe millions of world class teachers
and that just self replicates.

660
00:43:43,511 --> 00:43:47,080
So I think that would be the answer one.

661
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:52,350
I know we're bouncing around here,
but it's okay. The one of the,

662
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:54,940
when I started meditating
regularly for the first time,

663
00:43:55,510 --> 00:44:00,510
it was only because I had two people I
could identify with recommended to me

664
00:44:01,091 --> 00:44:05,710
when I was really in a very to dark
places. So one was chase Jarvis,

665
00:44:05,711 --> 00:44:07,000
who's a world class photographer.

666
00:44:07,001 --> 00:44:10,300
He's been on this podcast
and other was Rick Rubin,

667
00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:13,180
legendary music producer who
also has been on this podcast.

668
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:15,100
And in this particular case,

669
00:44:15,101 --> 00:44:17,050
and we'll get into the different
types of meditation. They said,

670
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:19,090
why don't you try TM?
Okay,

671
00:44:19,091 --> 00:44:24,091
so transcendental meditation and because
these two guys did not strike me as

672
00:44:24,821 --> 00:44:29,821
very woo woo or overly detached
from the stresses I faced,

673
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:34,410
does that make sense?
Like they were negotiating contracts,

674
00:44:34,430 --> 00:44:35,850
they were dealing with difficult people.

675
00:44:35,851 --> 00:44:39,240
They were really on the front
lines of their own respective wars.

676
00:44:39,241 --> 00:44:42,180
If you want to look at it that
way. And so I was like, okay,

677
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:47,210
if they're recommending this thing that
I've kind of discarded as a not a fit

678
00:44:48,661 --> 00:44:49,770
for me. Right. I, I've,

679
00:44:49,771 --> 00:44:52,530
I've always shied away from using
the word spiritual for instance.

680
00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:58,350
But because it came from these two
people, I decided to give it a shot. The,

681
00:44:58,351 --> 00:45:01,140
and then I started seeing the
benefits of meditation. I mean,

682
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:06,200
even if I just looked at it through the
lens of my type a personality full of

683
00:45:08,071 --> 00:45:11,850
ambition and Piss and vinegar and
self flagellation, I was like,

684
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,710
if I meditate in the morning,

685
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:18,690
I get more done with less
stress and others less flailing.

686
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:23,280
So for that reason, for that reason
alone, I don't meditate. Right.

687
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:24,180
Uh,

688
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:28,740
and then I remember getting to a point
after meditating for the first time ever

689
00:45:28,741 --> 00:45:32,880
in my life consistently for about, I don't
know, let's, let's call it two weeks.

690
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:34,463
I was,

691
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:39,390
I was on a road trip with a friend of
mine who had had a very similar experience

692
00:45:39,391 --> 00:45:41,940
and, and uh, she asked me,

693
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:44,670
do you ever worry that
you're getting to chill,

694
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:50,670
that you are losing your edge,
that you're not doing things you should,

695
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:55,700
you should because you're too
accepting of whatever happens as being,

696
00:45:58,501 --> 00:46:02,790
okay. Uh, so I struggled with
that. I know we're, we're, uh,

697
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:06,300
we're digging in here, but,
uh, that, that balancing of

698
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:15,470
enjoying the benefits of meditation and
how much I would say happier I am and

699
00:46:16,651 --> 00:46:21,651
how much more content I am when I meditate
regularly with the nagging concern

700
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:28,070
that perhaps I've taken
it too far and I'm,

701
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:32,460
I've just become
lackadaisical or complacent.

702
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:36,840
And when I talk to my friends who
are like world class performers,

703
00:46:36,841 --> 00:46:40,440
type a personalities, they all have
this kind of this concern, right?

704
00:46:40,441 --> 00:46:42,450
Like what if I lose my edge? Right? Like,

705
00:46:42,451 --> 00:46:47,400
what if I lose the thing that
has allowed me to be the top,

706
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:52,030
you know, in the top 5% in my field
as opposed to an also ran. And I mean,

707
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:55,320
I just love to hear your thoughts on
that because this is something that, uh,

708
00:46:56,490 --> 00:47:00,050
that, uh, it hasn't stopped me from
meditating because I feel like it,

709
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:02,650
that's my medication on some level too,

710
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:06,500
to keep me from not being a huge pain in
the ass to myself and everyone around.

711
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:09,583
Well,
how about this?

712
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:15,530
Here's the way that I think is
that I like to frame it is that

713
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:22,220
meditation is evolution strategy
to bring out our full potential.

714
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,300
Well, I like that. Okay.

715
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,850
And just the way we know we need to still
exercise to maximize our body's health,

716
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:36,190
we need to mentally trained too.
And so meditation's very broad.

717
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:39,190
You know, there are many
different kinds of meditations,

718
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:43,900
but a training of the,
I'll call it the heart mind,

719
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:47,680
really what it does in
a very specific way.

720
00:47:47,681 --> 00:47:52,681
This is what research is showing is it
activates a part of the frontal cortex

721
00:47:52,811 --> 00:47:56,740
where there's kind of neurocircuitry
that really has to do with, um,

722
00:47:56,860 --> 00:47:58,840
being able to have a larger perspective,

723
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:02,350
being able to have better
executive functioning,

724
00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:06,160
being able to have more empathy,
being able to have more compassion.

725
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:09,360
And it started evolving in the
human species. You know, we,

726
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:14,140
it's what led us form tribes and be
able to start collaborating more.

727
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:18,010
And it's a collaboration that's actually
allowed us to have the greatest of the

728
00:48:18,011 --> 00:48:22,210
scientific kind of breakthroughs
and so on. So if you look at it,

729
00:48:22,211 --> 00:48:24,820
and then in terms of
evolutionary development,

730
00:48:24,821 --> 00:48:29,290
both your own evolution
and also as a species,

731
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:33,130
the more that we learn
to direct our attention,

732
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:37,330
the more we have access to what's
called like a whole brain thinking,

733
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:41,630
where we really can be creative, where
we really can be spontaneous. We,

734
00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:44,100
it's almost like it evolves.

735
00:48:44,110 --> 00:48:49,110
So this past the identification with a
separate cell into something more whole.

736
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:54,180
And I think often of all this actually
describes this reducing valve of

737
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:59,181
awareness where in the EGOIC state the
mind just takes in the information so we

738
00:49:00,011 --> 00:49:04,680
can, you know, survive and do
our, our daily functions. And it,

739
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:09,010
it kind of blocks out a lot of the
vast mysteries of the universe.

740
00:49:09,011 --> 00:49:13,330
And as we meditate that reducing
valve doesn't reduce so much.

741
00:49:13,331 --> 00:49:18,331
So we actually have more of the flow
of a kind of universal intelligence.

742
00:49:18,611 --> 00:49:20,770
And creativity that moves through us.

743
00:49:21,590 --> 00:49:26,590
So I do think of it that this training
actually can allow us to access our

744
00:49:27,071 --> 00:49:28,150
greatest potential.

745
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:32,500
Now here's a couple of pieces
to it that in the egoic state,

746
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:37,650
dominance and competition are
really the way to a flourishing.

747
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:41,290
And so those people not familiar
with the term, the EGOIC state,

748
00:49:41,291 --> 00:49:43,180
it's just the focus on I

749
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:45,250
yes,
yes it did.

750
00:49:45,270 --> 00:49:50,050
It's very self focused so that we're
doing things so that we can, um,

751
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:51,790
I can be the basket,

752
00:49:51,850 --> 00:49:55,660
I want to be recognized because I want
to be special because I'm an important

753
00:49:55,661 --> 00:49:56,770
person.
So it's that kind of thing.

754
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:58,470
Sounds like my writing.
I'm kidding.

755
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:02,870
And

756
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:07,010
when you think of the moments when
you're happiest, it may give you an,

757
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:12,080
we might get an initial rush of chemicals
when we feel personally recognize and

758
00:50:12,081 --> 00:50:15,620
personally the baster.
I know I wrote in my most recent book,

759
00:50:15,621 --> 00:50:19,790
my special person complex. You know,
where I get caught and you know,

760
00:50:19,970 --> 00:50:24,080
feeling important in some way.
And yet that's not when we're happiest.

761
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:28,340
In fact, you know, the way that you
can sense and an evolutionary way.

762
00:50:28,341 --> 00:50:33,341
So we are as a species learning
to identify with larger,

763
00:50:33,501 --> 00:50:38,000
wider and wider circles of beings
were able to feel a sense of,

764
00:50:38,001 --> 00:50:43,001
as you and I talked that it's not
me proving something are impressing,

765
00:50:44,121 --> 00:50:47,570
but it's, there's some collectivity
that's going on between us.

766
00:50:47,571 --> 00:50:50,060
It's creating an entirely new field.

767
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:54,290
I could not agree more and also

768
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:59,640
to speak more cause I've had
a lot of caffeine. The uh,

769
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:04,720
the fact of the matter is if I want to
have the impact that I mentioned and to

770
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:12,690
create hundreds of thousands or millions
of worldclass learners, the most,

771
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:16,440
the, the more effective way to do
that is by having a team to help me.

772
00:51:16,441 --> 00:51:20,190
So whether whether I'm
collaborating with five people,

773
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:25,191
10 people or a hundred people or even
fewer potentially having a very short fuse

774
00:51:25,470 --> 00:51:27,180
has been a major handicap for me.

775
00:51:27,510 --> 00:51:30,060
That's exactly the,
that's exactly where I was going.

776
00:51:30,061 --> 00:51:35,061
Is that the thing you most want to
experience and to produce for you,

777
00:51:38,041 --> 00:51:41,940
Tim, is world class learners
and world class teachers,

778
00:51:41,941 --> 00:51:46,941
which I'm imagining if I read into
that with then allow there to be more

779
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:51,480
creativity, healing and wellbeing.
On the planet earth. Yes,

780
00:51:51,690 --> 00:51:53,670
definitely more and more problem solvers.

781
00:51:53,671 --> 00:51:58,671
So you have no problem solvers who can
also train additional problem solvers,

782
00:52:00,001 --> 00:52:04,270
right? So it becomes this sort of
exactly the Netherlands virus. I,

783
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:06,660
I mean, maybe that's not
the right phrasing to use,

784
00:52:06,661 --> 00:52:11,661
but a wave of problem solving
that it's hard to contain.

785
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:17,660
That only happens when we are
operating in a collaborative way.

786
00:52:17,661 --> 00:52:19,900
So what the very,
um,

787
00:52:19,910 --> 00:52:24,740
domain that you are engaged with
is really a more about domain.

788
00:52:24,741 --> 00:52:29,330
It's not the competitive domain.
It's going more towards collectivity,

789
00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:30,300
towards,
um,

790
00:52:30,710 --> 00:52:35,710
belonging to a field and you're working
to wake up to that and engage other

791
00:52:35,751 --> 00:52:40,040
people in it. So, in a way,
when you ask that question,
what will keep my edge? Well,

792
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:45,520
really the new edge that we want to
keep as our capacity for empathy and

793
00:52:46,731 --> 00:52:49,370
collaboration and mutual creativity.

794
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:53,840
Right? Right. Yeah. I'm sharpening the,
the hatchet when it's like, no, dude,

795
00:52:53,841 --> 00:52:57,150
you got to sharpen the saw. It's a
different tool. You're spending your talk.

796
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:58,040
Exactly.
Right.

797
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:03,150
Interestingly, with
meditation, it doesn't,

798
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:07,020
what it does is it actually serves
that you become better at that.

799
00:53:07,830 --> 00:53:09,480
Yeah. I've, uh, I,

800
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:14,520
I've been really profoundly
affected by a daily practice.

801
00:53:14,961 --> 00:53:15,741
And what I would,

802
00:53:15,741 --> 00:53:20,741
I'd love to do to get granular for people
is to talk about perhaps some thought

803
00:53:21,621 --> 00:53:26,621
exercises or practices that people are
currently working 80 hours a week and

804
00:53:27,061 --> 00:53:32,061
feel like they can't take a lot of time
[inaudible] Tate could utilize and I'm

805
00:53:33,641 --> 00:53:37,210
not, I'm not sure if the sacred pause
is a good one to talk about. Um,

806
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:41,400
I really enjoyed that discussion.
Um, but could you also,

807
00:53:41,401 --> 00:53:44,550
because I feel like among
my group of friends,

808
00:53:44,551 --> 00:53:48,060
this would be very interesting
for them to contemplate. Could,

809
00:53:48,110 --> 00:53:51,570
can you talk about little exercises
that people could use? Uh,

810
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:54,950
if they want to not flame out.

811
00:53:54,951 --> 00:53:58,320
And what I mean by that is I know a lot
of type a personalities who are like,

812
00:53:58,370 --> 00:54:00,030
if I'm going to meditate,
I'm going to meditate.

813
00:54:00,031 --> 00:54:03,210
And so they try to block it out like an
hour every morning for like five days a

814
00:54:03,211 --> 00:54:05,880
week. And of course they don't
make it to the end of the week.

815
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:09,270
It becomes too much. So I'd like
to prevent that, you know, these,

816
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:12,550
these driven people from
defeating themselves, uh,

817
00:54:12,870 --> 00:54:16,640
which is what I did for a long time. But
the, uh, the inviting Mara to tea, um,

818
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:21,630
I'd love for you to describe what that is.
Uh,

819
00:54:21,631 --> 00:54:24,240
and yeah,
and then I'll let you run with,

820
00:54:24,270 --> 00:54:26,250
with the discussion
wherever you want to go.

821
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:29,130
Okay.
So in the Buddhist mythology,

822
00:54:29,131 --> 00:54:34,131
and this is to me one of the most
amazingly contemporary relevant kind of

823
00:54:34,861 --> 00:54:36,090
principles in the universe,

824
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:41,640
the Buddha's awakening
to a larger reality.

825
00:54:41,730 --> 00:54:45,180
I came through, he sat this night, uh,

826
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:48,540
under what's called the Bodhi tree.
The vote is the tree of awakening.

827
00:54:48,541 --> 00:54:50,430
And through the night,

828
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:55,230
the God Mara who represents a anger,

829
00:54:55,231 --> 00:55:00,150
greed, pride, a version,
um, passion, jealousy,

830
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:01,013
all the,

831
00:55:01,170 --> 00:55:05,640
all the forces that can
take over and create misery.

832
00:55:06,050 --> 00:55:08,100
I packed them and you know,
there were,

833
00:55:08,101 --> 00:55:13,101
so there were arrows and flames of light
and spears and so on coming at them.

834
00:55:13,171 --> 00:55:13,891
And you know,

835
00:55:13,891 --> 00:55:18,891
he sat through the night and practice
this quality of presence so that all this,

836
00:55:20,010 --> 00:55:24,450
the attacks, each of the weapons
turned into a flower petal.

837
00:55:24,451 --> 00:55:28,400
So by the morning, morning
star when it rose, he,

838
00:55:28,410 --> 00:55:33,330
there was a heap of pedals that is at, is,
uh, in front of him. But interestingly,

839
00:55:33,390 --> 00:55:36,960
Mara did not just vanish
and the Buddhist lifetime,

840
00:55:36,961 --> 00:55:41,150
Mara would keep appearing and so huge,

841
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:43,980
the Buddha would be teaching
in a field somewhere.

842
00:55:43,981 --> 00:55:48,090
A lot of people gathered and Mara would
start lurking in the outskirts and the

843
00:55:48,091 --> 00:55:51,390
Buddha's loyal attendant would be
freaked out and they'd say, Oh my God,

844
00:55:51,391 --> 00:55:53,730
Mara is here. What are we
going to do? The shadow is com,

845
00:55:54,210 --> 00:55:57,360
but the Buddha would kind
of say, chill. It's okay.

846
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:02,460
And then what do you do is go right
tomorrow and say, I see you Mara. Come,

847
00:56:02,461 --> 00:56:03,294
let's have tea.

848
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:10,160
And what those two
communications really say.

849
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:14,910
I see you, Mara is mindfulness.
You know, I see you.

850
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:19,800
I get in this moment what's happening?
Okay, there's fear, there's anger.

851
00:56:19,801 --> 00:56:22,770
It's so this,
this capacity.

852
00:56:22,771 --> 00:56:26,920
We each have to pause and just
recognize this is what's here right now.

853
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:30,620
It's an honest recognition.
So he said, I see you Mara.

854
00:56:30,621 --> 00:56:34,750
And that's considered the first wing
of presence, seeing what's here.

855
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:37,120
And then the second come,

856
00:56:37,121 --> 00:56:42,100
let's have tea is instead of
fighting what's here in the moment,

857
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:45,220
there's making space for it.
There's getting to know it.

858
00:56:45,221 --> 00:56:46,750
There's a quality of heart.

859
00:56:46,930 --> 00:56:51,580
It's the quality of heart space that
lets the life be just as it is in the

860
00:56:51,581 --> 00:56:52,414
moment.

861
00:56:52,990 --> 00:56:57,990
And these two wings of presence that
you see in this myth really are the very

862
00:56:59,081 --> 00:57:04,081
foundation of a meditation practice
that in any moment that we can pause and

863
00:57:04,691 --> 00:57:09,100
say, you know, you can ask that question.
So what is happening inside me right now?

864
00:57:10,270 --> 00:57:14,540
And I invite all of you who are
listening to this right now just to,

865
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:17,950
you might just check in what is
happening inside me right now.

866
00:57:20,010 --> 00:57:20,843
Okay?

867
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,550
I check the feelings in your body
sensations. If there's a mood,

868
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:32,140
this is the first wing of
mindfulness that we say, okay,

869
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:36,970
so here's what it's like right now,
Mary, with our senses, very embodied.

870
00:57:37,810 --> 00:57:42,070
And then the second win,
which is let's have tea,

871
00:57:42,370 --> 00:57:43,440
is really like a thing.

872
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:48,660
I'm just going to allow how
this experience is right
now to be just as it is

873
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:52,840
with amber brings some interest and
some care to it. Let's have tea.

874
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:58,540
So it's a way of being with
ourselves that's intimate,

875
00:57:58,810 --> 00:58:03,610
that's full and naturally it extends.
Cause if you can say to yourself,

876
00:58:03,910 --> 00:58:08,170
okay, here's what's happening,
there's some anxiety and
okay, let me be with that.

877
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:14,250
Then when you run into another person
and they are aggravating and you in some

878
00:58:14,381 --> 00:58:18,910
way and judgment comes up or they're
intimidating you, you could say,

879
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:22,690
oh okay, so this is Mara
again. Um, I see you Mara,

880
00:58:22,691 --> 00:58:23,970
and you're saying this to yourself.
I,

881
00:58:23,971 --> 00:58:28,030
I get that this is intimidating and
let's talk to you. So there's a,

882
00:58:28,150 --> 00:58:30,850
you create a space of
presence for what's there.

883
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:36,480
And in response to what you said earlier
is couldn't this be passive or kind of

884
00:58:36,911 --> 00:58:39,370
a, a chill stance? Um,

885
00:58:40,330 --> 00:58:45,330
it's really out of that presence that
we can then act in a way that is most

886
00:58:47,891 --> 00:58:49,780
intelligent and most empowered.

887
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:54,990
So this one radical presence and radical
acceptance that I'm describing these

888
00:58:54,991 --> 00:58:59,991
two wings of what's going on and let's
have tea that's not are permanent stance.

889
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:04,900
That's the grounds for action.
It's like we've come home into the moment,

890
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:07,420
we've come into some
stability and balance,

891
00:59:07,421 --> 00:59:10,150
and then when we respond to the world,

892
00:59:10,450 --> 00:59:13,930
we actually are responding
from our full potential.

893
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:15,970
We're not in a reactive mode.

894
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:19,870
We have our internal house in
order. I mean it's, we have,

895
00:59:21,290 --> 00:59:22,010
that's exactly

896
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:24,740
right. Yeah. We've, we've,
we've, we've Rican, you know,

897
00:59:24,741 --> 00:59:28,460
we're online again in a way because what
happens is when we're reacting to the

898
00:59:28,461 --> 00:59:29,294
world,

899
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:33,920
we kind of cut off from some of the
parts of our frontal cortex that actually

900
00:59:33,921 --> 00:59:38,300
can make us most effective.
And I'll give you an example.

901
00:59:38,301 --> 00:59:41,080
A story that that's always touched me of

902
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:47,620
this is a surgeon or commanding
surgeon in the army who took us,

903
00:59:47,870 --> 00:59:51,990
took an anger management course. So this
does is, this has to do with anger down.

904
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:57,050
And you took this course and it
was very much based on mindfulness,

905
00:59:57,140 --> 01:00:01,880
based on what is happening in this
moment. And can I open to this? Okay.

906
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:06,580
So he took the course because
she was ordered to actually and

907
01:00:08,470 --> 01:00:12,010
yeah, yeah, yeah. And um, and he,

908
01:00:12,011 --> 01:00:16,890
and then as the story goes, he went the
end of the day to a supermarket to um,

909
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:17,501
you know,

910
01:00:17,501 --> 01:00:21,790
cause he need this so up on supplies and
he gets into line and in front of him

911
01:00:21,791 --> 01:00:26,650
as a woman with just a few items
in her cart. And not only that,

912
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:31,210
um, she's got a baby and it isn't,
this is not the express line.

913
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:34,420
And so we start fuming cause why
does she get into express line?

914
01:00:34,421 --> 01:00:36,130
She's in front of me and taking time.

915
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:41,500
She has the baby to the clerk and they
are laying and I know over this little

916
01:00:41,501 --> 01:00:44,410
girl and so he is okay.

917
01:00:44,411 --> 01:00:48,190
So he is triggered and he
remembers mindfulness. Okay.

918
01:00:48,370 --> 01:00:51,860
The first step with my phone,
cause you pause and that's a sacred pause.

919
01:00:51,861 --> 01:00:55,210
She sense, okay, something's
going on, let's pause.

920
01:00:55,990 --> 01:00:59,680
And then the second step is, okay, so
what's going on inside me right now?

921
01:00:59,770 --> 01:01:02,050
You know, what are we
seeing? And He, you know,

922
01:01:02,051 --> 01:01:06,810
so he noticed it was anger and then he
could feel underneath the anger that

923
01:01:07,180 --> 01:01:08,170
anxiety.

924
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:13,200
And many of us know the anxiety of when
we're busy and on our way and it feels

925
01:01:13,901 --> 01:01:16,360
like a whole world's going to fall apart
cause we're going to be late or not

926
01:01:16,361 --> 01:01:17,194
prepared.

927
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:21,670
So he could censor his anger
and fear underneath the anger.

928
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:25,420
And then as she had to with it,
as he just stayed with it,

929
01:01:25,870 --> 01:01:28,690
he found some more space
and some more presence.

930
01:01:29,130 --> 01:01:31,960
So when he looked up and he saw the
little girl, I thought, oh, she's cute.

931
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:35,260
And when it was his turn, the
woman had left with, with the girl.

932
01:01:36,010 --> 01:01:39,250
He said to the clerk, you know
that that little girl was adorable.

933
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:42,790
And the clerk beamed at him and she said,
Oh thank you.

934
01:01:43,210 --> 01:01:44,800
Actually that's my little girl.

935
01:01:44,830 --> 01:01:49,310
My husband was killed in Afghanistan
last year and my mom brings,

936
01:01:49,311 --> 01:01:54,310
sure by everyday, twice a day so we
have a little time together. Wow.

937
01:01:56,740 --> 01:01:57,573
Yeah.

938
01:01:57,820 --> 01:02:02,820
I share that story because if we
don't pause and deepen attention,

939
01:02:04,540 --> 01:02:07,160
we live out patterns.
We've been living our whole lives.

940
01:02:07,210 --> 01:02:12,040
To keep us separated from ourselves,
our highest self and each other.

941
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:15,750
And you know, we don't know what's
going on for others. You know,

942
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:19,650
it's not like everybody has
just endured that kind a loss,

943
01:02:19,651 --> 01:02:24,080
but not everybody's struggling hard.
And we're so quick to,

944
01:02:24,470 --> 01:02:27,420
to take personally into
read our lives into things,

945
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:33,140
to be able to pause and both bring
mindfulness and attention inwardly.

946
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:38,760
And then outwardly this is,
this is what's going to change the world.

947
01:02:38,790 --> 01:02:42,960
This is what's gonna allow us to
step out of reactivity that tools,

948
01:02:42,990 --> 01:02:46,800
wars and actually be more collaborative.
This is evolution.

949
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:53,160
I really appreciate that story also
because it brings to mind for those people

950
01:02:53,351 --> 01:02:58,060
out there who are struggling with some
of the same things as this, uh, the,

951
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:02,440
the gent in the story or, you know, the,
the kinds of things that I, I'm very,

952
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:04,053
uh,

953
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:08,320
sometimes the anger very often takes
the form of impatience or maybe it's the

954
01:03:08,321 --> 01:03:12,810
other way around. I'm not sure.
But, uh, very impatient and, uh,

955
01:03:12,850 --> 01:03:15,640
generally always have been. I mean,
ever since I was a little kid, if,

956
01:03:15,670 --> 01:03:19,150
if I sat with an empty water glass in
a restaurant and my mom thinks this is

957
01:03:19,151 --> 01:03:20,530
hilarious,
but also kind of annoying,

958
01:03:20,531 --> 01:03:23,560
I would just like get up and walk into
the kitchen and grab a pitcher of water,

959
01:03:23,910 --> 01:03:26,860
like not known for by my patients.

960
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:31,120
And there are benefits to that sometimes.
Uh,

961
01:03:31,210 --> 01:03:35,500
but the,
what I started doing a few years ago,

962
01:03:35,501 --> 01:03:39,130
and in fact what I think helped prime
me for meditation is reading quite a bit

963
01:03:39,131 --> 01:03:41,560
of stoic philosophy, uh, which,

964
01:03:41,561 --> 01:03:46,561
which I think has a lot in common with
certain types of Buddhism or teachers,

965
01:03:48,130 --> 01:03:51,220
teachings of Buddhism. Anyway, but
a couple of things really helped me.

966
01:03:51,221 --> 01:03:53,870
The first was,
uh,

967
01:03:54,550 --> 01:03:57,760
trying in the morning to basically do it.
Marcus are released it.

968
01:03:57,761 --> 01:04:00,520
So Marcus are really as who wrote
meditations, but it was really a,

969
01:04:00,610 --> 01:04:01,960
basically a journal.

970
01:04:01,961 --> 01:04:05,350
There was never intended for publication
was at one point the most powerful man

971
01:04:05,351 --> 01:04:09,880
in the world. And he would wake up, and
this sounds depressing to some people,

972
01:04:09,881 --> 01:04:13,720
but I don't find it depressing. And he
would say, you know, today I am going to,

973
01:04:13,721 --> 01:04:17,650
and I'm paraphrasing, but run into
people who are ungrateful, rude,

974
01:04:17,990 --> 01:04:19,480
entitled,
et Cetera.

975
01:04:19,481 --> 01:04:24,310
And basically I sh I need to be prepared
for that and not overreact to it.

976
01:04:24,730 --> 01:04:26,800
And along the same lines,
you know,

977
01:04:26,801 --> 01:04:31,450
in the mornings when I've tried to remind
myself of when I Journal at usually

978
01:04:31,451 --> 01:04:34,210
after meditating is you know,
everyone is fighting a battle.

979
01:04:34,211 --> 01:04:38,320
You know nothing about number one. And
then number two, and I think this is,

980
01:04:38,321 --> 01:04:41,560
this was extremely important for me
and I can't remember who told me this

981
01:04:41,561 --> 01:04:41,951
initially,

982
01:04:41,951 --> 01:04:45,850
but it was don't ascribe to malice
what can be explained by incompetence.

983
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:48,460
And I actually added
to that and I was like,

984
01:04:48,670 --> 01:04:52,780
don't ascribe to malice what can be
explained by incompetence or dizziness.

985
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:57,340
Right. And I mean I'm, I'm
amazed sometimes, and I know
I've done this in the past,

986
01:04:57,341 --> 01:05:00,280
but when somebody will come up to me,
I've never met them before my life,

987
01:05:00,281 --> 01:05:04,270
and they'll say, you didn't respond to my
email. I'm like, I don't know your name.

988
01:05:04,271 --> 01:05:06,790
I don't know who you are.
I have no idea what you're talking about,

989
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:09,490
but they're overreaction to that.
You know,

990
01:05:09,491 --> 01:05:12,940
assuming that I had sort of slighted
them by reading the email and siding,

991
01:05:12,941 --> 01:05:15,730
it was unimportant and the ignoring it,
which was not the case at all,

992
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:17,080
his guarantee,

993
01:05:17,110 --> 01:05:22,030
virtually guaranteed that I will not
respond to there cause I got so pissed off

994
01:05:22,031 --> 01:05:24,610
and flew off the handle and I have no idea
what their name is in the first place.

995
01:05:25,140 --> 01:05:28,450
Uh, but what, what are Le,

996
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:30,910
let's look at a couple of
different types of meditation.

997
01:05:30,911 --> 01:05:34,720
I'd love for you to sort of describe,
actually, let me, let me take a step back.

998
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:38,680
Let's talk about your personal experience.
So what does your,

999
01:05:38,681 --> 01:05:43,330
what does the first 60 to 90
minutes of your day look like?

1000
01:05:43,390 --> 01:05:44,500
Your morning routine?

1001
01:05:45,970 --> 01:05:50,560
Well, I am woken up if I don't wake up
myself, I get up real early. I mean,

1002
01:05:50,561 --> 01:05:54,990
I actually wake up around, well not
real early, that five or so, five 30,

1003
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,100
but if I don't pop out of bed,

1004
01:05:57,130 --> 01:06:02,130
then I've got a dog that will climb on
my chest and licked my face and nudged me

1005
01:06:02,141 --> 01:06:03,650
out of bed.
Um,

1006
01:06:03,910 --> 01:06:08,910
and so he does that because we
go right away straight from,

1007
01:06:10,030 --> 01:06:13,120
uh, we go right down to the river.
I live right by this Tomic River.

1008
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:17,890
So usually hike for about three
to four miles in the morning.

1009
01:06:17,891 --> 01:06:21,540
It's the first thing with my dog
and it's almost any weather. Um,

1010
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:25,090
I was think that, no breakfast,
no coffee, Yay. Yeah,

1011
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:30,220
go out. I just leave cause I
find for myself, um, I like, um,

1012
01:06:30,340 --> 01:06:33,020
I've always been very physical and um,

1013
01:06:33,130 --> 01:06:35,540
so and when I was younger,

1014
01:06:35,650 --> 01:06:39,010
more athletic and that's a whole other
story because I did lose it for a while.

1015
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:40,090
But,
um,

1016
01:06:40,090 --> 01:06:45,010
I find that for me just moving and
moving vigorously and being in nature is,

1017
01:06:45,570 --> 01:06:48,730
you know, if I had to say what my religion
is, it's, you know, being in nature,

1018
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:51,790
I just love it. So, you know,

1019
01:06:51,791 --> 01:06:56,620
so we go and we do is kind of
up down hike and by the river,

1020
01:06:56,800 --> 01:07:01,720
by the river and in the hills.
And then about an hour into the hike,

1021
01:07:01,721 --> 01:07:06,721
I have a place by a stream that I'll
stop and then I'll do a meditation there.

1022
01:07:07,180 --> 01:07:10,890
So I do a standing
meditation there and uh,

1023
01:07:11,140 --> 01:07:15,820
could last anywhere from 20 to 45 minutes
and then we do the rest of the hike

1024
01:07:15,821 --> 01:07:16,780
and I come home.

1025
01:07:17,190 --> 01:07:20,920
What does that standing meditation,
uh,

1026
01:07:22,020 --> 01:07:24,910
what, what is that comprised of? Uh,

1027
01:07:26,350 --> 01:07:28,470
what does it consist of?
Like said, so when you,

1028
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:33,920
if you could just walk us through what
that standing meditation is sort of

1029
01:07:34,381 --> 01:07:37,590
internally, what the, what you're
focusing on and not focusing on et cetera.

1030
01:07:38,550 --> 01:07:41,080
Sure. And, and any one of the component,

1031
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:46,000
the first part is really pausing.
It's like getting that, ah,

1032
01:07:46,050 --> 01:07:50,140
okay. I just stopped this forward
motion that's like we have,

1033
01:07:50,150 --> 01:07:52,470
we always have the sense that
we're on our way somewhere.

1034
01:07:53,100 --> 01:07:54,660
So there's really a sense of,
okay,

1035
01:07:54,661 --> 01:07:59,661
I'm pausing to be right here and that
this moment matters as much as any moment

1036
01:08:00,931 --> 01:08:03,120
in the whole universe because we tend to,

1037
01:08:03,150 --> 01:08:05,370
we tend to think that this
isn't what's important.

1038
01:08:05,371 --> 01:08:09,510
It's yet to come or it's back there.
So to really just pause,

1039
01:08:09,540 --> 01:08:13,710
and there's a beautiful
quote from Viktor Frankl.

1040
01:08:13,711 --> 01:08:17,720
It says between the stimulus,
the response, there's a space.

1041
01:08:18,140 --> 01:08:21,320
And in that space is your
power and your freedom.

1042
01:08:23,410 --> 01:08:27,410
So that, that's the beginning. It's just
getting, okay, pausing and arriving,

1043
01:08:28,450 --> 01:08:29,320
open or closed.

1044
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:34,010
Well, sometimes I'll start open
and really taken the, you know,

1045
01:08:34,011 --> 01:08:38,390
I'm right by a stream and right
now there's, you know, incredible,

1046
01:08:38,540 --> 01:08:43,460
you know, the birds and the sounds of
the currents and everything. It's uh,

1047
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:45,590
it's quite lovely,
but so I'll take it all in,

1048
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:49,700
but of course my eyes eventually
just to kind of quiet my mind more.

1049
01:08:51,050 --> 01:08:54,380
So I began very much with a,

1050
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:58,790
a kind of a sweep through
the body with my awareness.

1051
01:08:58,820 --> 01:09:03,080
And I will kind of starting
from the head down,

1052
01:09:03,110 --> 01:09:08,110
I'll just soften and relax different
parts of my body so that I'm feeling the

1053
01:09:09,021 --> 01:09:12,590
life from the inside out.
So I'm feeling a sense of sensation.

1054
01:09:12,980 --> 01:09:17,210
So if you're listening and you just close
your eyes and I sometimes will use the

1055
01:09:17,211 --> 01:09:19,160
image of a smile to help,

1056
01:09:19,610 --> 01:09:22,490
to deepen that sense of presence and ease.

1057
01:09:22,590 --> 01:09:26,570
You can sense the eyes smiling.

1058
01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:31,040
You can smile into your eyes and feel
the corners of the eyes up a little and

1059
01:09:31,041 --> 01:09:32,300
let the brow be smooth.

1060
01:09:32,301 --> 01:09:37,100
So there's just a way of softening in the
eyes because when we're thinking a lot,

1061
01:09:37,190 --> 01:09:41,750
when we're in that home movie that's
filled with a kind of incessant inner

1062
01:09:41,751 --> 01:09:46,750
dialogue and a lot of, a lot
of fear usually or stress, um,

1063
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,520
the, the little muscles
around the eyes or tense.

1064
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:54,350
So by softening the eyes and
letting the brow be smooth,

1065
01:09:54,490 --> 01:09:59,490
that that actually helps the mind to
quiet some and you can actually put a half

1066
01:10:00,351 --> 01:10:05,060
smile on the mouth. And uh, it's amazing.

1067
01:10:05,061 --> 01:10:09,380
There's a lot of research on this dude
that if you have a little bit of a smile

1068
01:10:09,381 --> 01:10:11,900
and you can feel the inside
of your mouth smiling,

1069
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:16,670
that that actually sends a message
to your whole nervous system too.

1070
01:10:16,671 --> 01:10:19,280
You can relax the whole
fight, flight, freeze,

1071
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:23,650
constellation and access more of,
um,

1072
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:28,670
in evolutionary terms it's called attend
and befriend that there's just more of

1073
01:10:28,671 --> 01:10:33,500
a benevolent witnessing when there's a
slight smile. So that's another trick.

1074
01:10:33,860 --> 01:10:36,680
And again, even if you're not
sitting for a long meditation,

1075
01:10:36,681 --> 01:10:41,681
just pausing and closing your eyes and
relaxing the eyes and having a little bit

1076
01:10:44,271 --> 01:10:46,370
of a smile itself,

1077
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:51,400
just even a 32nd pause can shift you
from the sympathetic nervous system,

1078
01:10:53,931 --> 01:10:58,931
which is really a very defensive and
aggressive to the parasympathetic,

1079
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:01,850
which is much more ease filled.

1080
01:11:03,380 --> 01:11:06,140
So I sweep down the eyes the mouth,

1081
01:11:06,740 --> 01:11:11,240
I go to the shoulders and
let the shoulders fall away
from my next song so that

1082
01:11:11,241 --> 01:11:15,840
I can just soften in the shoulders.
And even again,

1083
01:11:15,841 --> 01:11:16,471
as you're sitting,

1084
01:11:16,471 --> 01:11:20,670
you might feel the shoulders from the
inside and see if it's possible to have a

1085
01:11:20,671 --> 01:11:23,910
little bit of that,
that melting of ice to water.

1086
01:11:24,870 --> 01:11:25,420
Okay.

1087
01:11:25,420 --> 01:11:26,430
I still water.

1088
01:11:27,850 --> 01:11:28,590
Okay.

1089
01:11:28,590 --> 01:11:31,470
And then what are two
gas kind of letting go.

1090
01:11:33,650 --> 01:11:38,210
And it's really, really helpful
to let the hands rest in that, um,

1091
01:11:38,780 --> 01:11:39,650
very easy,

1092
01:11:39,651 --> 01:11:44,180
effortless way because when I have my
hands by my side or if you have your hands

1093
01:11:44,181 --> 01:11:46,190
in your lap,
because again,

1094
01:11:46,191 --> 01:11:51,191
when we're stressed we have these
micro muscles tense in the hand.

1095
01:11:51,601 --> 01:11:54,890
So by consciously softening your hands,

1096
01:11:55,370 --> 01:11:58,610
you actually deconditioning that stuff.
Stress Reaction.

1097
01:11:59,550 --> 01:12:02,040
This was actually a question
that a number of readers had,

1098
01:12:02,041 --> 01:12:05,490
which was sort of like
a Ricky Bobby I think.

1099
01:12:05,491 --> 01:12:08,160
And tally tally Talladega
nights knows anchorman.

1100
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:10,050
I don't know what to do with my hands.
I don't have to do with my hands.

1101
01:12:10,570 --> 01:12:13,080
They were asking when I'm
sitting in a sitting meditation,

1102
01:12:13,990 --> 01:12:16,740
does it matter what you do with your
hands? As long as they're relaxed,

1103
01:12:18,090 --> 01:12:23,090
there are literally called Mudras that
are hand positions that in a refined yoga

1104
01:12:24,390 --> 01:12:28,350
kind of perspective have energy
circulating a certain way.

1105
01:12:28,770 --> 01:12:31,260
But the deeper purpose of practice,

1106
01:12:31,261 --> 01:12:33,450
if you're training your
mind to pay attention,

1107
01:12:33,630 --> 01:12:35,760
if you just soften and relax your hands,

1108
01:12:35,850 --> 01:12:40,020
there'll be a slow and you
won't be perpetuating Kanchan

1109
01:12:40,510 --> 01:12:41,770
do you want your hands together?

1110
01:12:42,750 --> 01:12:44,340
They can be touching lightly,

1111
01:12:44,341 --> 01:12:49,341
but you can also play some palms down
on your right above your knees and just

1112
01:12:49,471 --> 01:12:54,330
let it be a light touch there
and just feel the contact,
the warmth, the tangling.

1113
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:55,680
And that's fine too.

1114
01:12:56,970 --> 01:12:57,803
Uh,

1115
01:12:59,130 --> 01:13:04,130
I've sometimes placed when I'm
sitting with my back straight,

1116
01:13:04,390 --> 01:13:08,890
uh, which analysis have a cushion behind
me because I find it too stressful to do

1117
01:13:08,910 --> 01:13:13,150
freestanding. But if I,
if I put my arms, this is,

1118
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:15,820
this is gonna sound like probably
the worst idea ever. But when I,

1119
01:13:16,270 --> 01:13:17,260
when I sort of sit,

1120
01:13:17,290 --> 01:13:21,760
I sometimes sit in a posture that's
similar to what I used to do for a judo

1121
01:13:21,761 --> 01:13:23,140
before practice.

1122
01:13:23,170 --> 01:13:27,580
They would have you do [inaudible] said
have you do a short meditation before

1123
01:13:27,581 --> 01:13:31,420
and afterwards and you basically put your
palms close to the crease in your hip

1124
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:35,140
so that your elbows are just kind
of flared out to the sides a bit.

1125
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:40,060
But for my 20 minute meditation,
I can tell almost the second one,

1126
01:13:40,061 --> 01:13:45,040
it's 20 minutes because my
wrist starts to tingle. But, uh,

1127
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:48,110
the, uh, I don't want to interrupt you.
The description of standing meditation,

1128
01:13:48,111 --> 01:13:50,890
what are you doing the sweep then for
how long do you do this? Sweet, right?

1129
01:13:51,170 --> 01:13:54,250
Hey, what I'm describing, most
people would do this sitting,

1130
01:13:54,310 --> 01:13:58,570
this just happens to be me cause I,
I just like being outside when I can,

1131
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:03,040
but everything I'm describing us for
those that are listening sit in a way

1132
01:14:03,310 --> 01:14:04,270
where,
you know,

1133
01:14:04,271 --> 01:14:09,271
ideally it's comfortable but you could
sit up tall because really you want the

1134
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:14,880
posture to invite forward the
qualities of mind that mattered to you.

1135
01:14:15,791 --> 01:14:19,300
So we want to be alert and
we also want to be at ease.

1136
01:14:19,390 --> 01:14:24,390
So the idea is sit comfortably but sit
with your spine tall and I would not use

1137
01:14:26,130 --> 01:14:30,130
the kind of thing you described him as it.
There's good reasons for judo, but for,

1138
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,000
for training and meditation,
let it be more relaxed.

1139
01:14:34,001 --> 01:14:36,460
You don't need anything to
adds tension to the body.

1140
01:14:37,830 --> 01:14:38,650
Yeah.

1141
01:14:38,650 --> 01:14:41,500
So yeah. So if I was going to continue
and I'm not, cause I'm actually,

1142
01:14:41,620 --> 01:14:45,670
I realized I was moving right into a
guided meditation, but um, just to,

1143
01:14:45,850 --> 01:14:50,080
just a sleep through the body and census
there anywhere they can relax just a

1144
01:14:50,081 --> 01:14:51,220
little bit more right now.

1145
01:14:52,460 --> 01:14:55,510
And what you'll find is
if you ask that question,

1146
01:14:55,780 --> 01:15:00,340
you'll notice that without even
knowing it, the body tenses and it,

1147
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:04,780
and to really relax and relax is really,
really helpful.

1148
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:06,280
And,

1149
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:09,370
and I want to emphasize just a couple
of things that have been helpful for me

1150
01:15:09,371 --> 01:15:13,900
and I'd let you feel free
to veto any of these. I'm,

1151
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:16,460
I'm still on training wheels, but, uh,

1152
01:15:16,550 --> 01:15:19,420
I know a lot of people out there haven't
even tried to get on the bike with

1153
01:15:19,421 --> 01:15:23,230
training wheels. So a few
things. Number one is,

1154
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:27,370
uh, I have, uh,

1155
01:15:27,490 --> 01:15:32,490
found that just the sitting
alone has huge benefits,

1156
01:15:33,430 --> 01:15:38,200
whether or not I feel I've been able
to quiet my mind in any way. So if I,

1157
01:15:38,201 --> 01:15:42,100
if I sit down for 20 minutes
with very upright posture,

1158
01:15:42,130 --> 01:15:45,660
sort of imagining like a thread being
pulled from the, the, the crown too,

1159
01:15:45,710 --> 01:15:50,710
to lengthen the spine and really try
to float my head into a place over my

1160
01:15:53,021 --> 01:15:57,480
shoulders and neck so that it feels
weightless to the extent possible. Uh,

1161
01:15:57,620 --> 01:16:00,700
I found so many calming benefits,

1162
01:16:00,701 --> 01:16:03,610
postural benefits after
even a week or two.

1163
01:16:03,610 --> 01:16:05,860
I've never had so many
compliments on my posture ever.

1164
01:16:05,861 --> 01:16:09,640
I've never had compliments about my
posture period in my life cause I'm built

1165
01:16:09,641 --> 01:16:13,540
like a monkey and a caveman and wrestle
for too long. So I have terrible posture.

1166
01:16:13,870 --> 01:16:16,570
But after a week or two, sort of
having complements my posture and my,

1167
01:16:16,630 --> 01:16:21,630
my walking gait and everything had changed
and found tremendous benefits of just

1168
01:16:22,210 --> 01:16:24,220
sitting with that upright,

1169
01:16:24,790 --> 01:16:27,670
not hunched over a laptop pop posture.

1170
01:16:28,050 --> 01:16:33,050
Even if I felt like my meditation was
quote a failure and quote because I was

1171
01:16:34,091 --> 01:16:37,190
just running through my to do list
or whatever for 20 minutes, uh,

1172
01:16:37,230 --> 01:16:40,570
and unable to turn off that monkey
mind. Uh, so just see that. Um,

1173
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:46,480
what, what would you suggest for
someone just getting started,

1174
01:16:46,540 --> 01:16:51,540
who's always been turned off of meditation
for any number of associations they

1175
01:16:51,731 --> 01:16:55,640
might have with meditation?
Mindfulness? What,

1176
01:16:55,690 --> 01:16:57,910
what is a good place to start?
So for instance,

1177
01:16:57,911 --> 01:17:00,970
there's a guy named Bj Fogg has done a
lot of research at Stanford. And if you,

1178
01:17:00,980 --> 01:17:04,120
if he wants someone to start flossing,
for instance, regularly, he'll say,

1179
01:17:04,540 --> 01:17:06,970
don't start with your whole mouth,
just floss your front teeth.

1180
01:17:07,330 --> 01:17:11,450
And he'll give them just the smallest,
uh,

1181
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:15,890
task possible to start building momentum.

1182
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:17,173
And

1183
01:17:17,290 --> 01:17:20,140
they, right. And that's the
way we do it too. In fact,

1184
01:17:20,141 --> 01:17:24,730
then got a program coming out I
think in January called mindful 40,

1185
01:17:24,731 --> 01:17:28,300
which is 40 days.
And you can really,

1186
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:33,720
really get the practice down at and we
do 10 minutes a day and it's five minutes

1187
01:17:34,001 --> 01:17:37,120
is some, you know, background and
in five minutes of meditation.

1188
01:17:37,121 --> 01:17:39,340
So I'm with you,
Tim.

1189
01:17:39,341 --> 01:17:42,690
I think starting with a
commitment no matter what,

1190
01:17:42,780 --> 01:17:47,780
every day helps a lot because nature
loves rhythms and you can build a habit

1191
01:17:48,131 --> 01:17:52,690
with that kind of, um,
every day practicing.

1192
01:17:52,691 --> 01:17:55,030
But here, here, here are
the basic ingredients,

1193
01:17:55,090 --> 01:18:00,090
is that it's useful at the beginning
to have a place that's quiet and that

1194
01:18:01,631 --> 01:18:03,070
you're not going to get interrupted.

1195
01:18:03,490 --> 01:18:07,150
And it's useful to close your eyes
just because that will, you know,

1196
01:18:07,151 --> 01:18:10,720
there's less stimuli visually
that stimulates associations.

1197
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:13,420
And it's useful to sit
still for a few minutes.

1198
01:18:13,420 --> 01:18:15,330
And know that you're just doing this as a,

1199
01:18:15,730 --> 01:18:20,730
this is your evolutionary strategy for
bringing out your best and just a few

1200
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:23,890
minutes of sitting still
and one of my friends says,

1201
01:18:23,891 --> 01:18:26,050
you put your Tush on your cushion,
you take what you get.

1202
01:18:26,051 --> 01:18:29,920
It doesn't matter what happened.
No, no, just sit there.

1203
01:18:30,250 --> 01:18:35,020
Now there are of course all sorts of
very helpful guidelines on how to direct

1204
01:18:35,021 --> 01:18:35,854
your attention.

1205
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:41,020
That will help to not only quiet
your mind but wake up your senses.

1206
01:18:41,260 --> 01:18:46,260
And one of the things that I most love
about the effect of meditation as I'm

1207
01:18:46,541 --> 01:18:47,620
more in my body,

1208
01:18:47,680 --> 01:18:52,680
it's like I go through the day and I'm
less in that trance of thinking or I'm

1209
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:57,940
going to kind of that I think of it as a
home movie where I'm just off somewhere

1210
01:18:57,941 --> 01:19:02,941
else and I feel more of a liveliness and
energy through my body and at my senses

1211
01:19:04,031 --> 01:19:05,170
are more awake.
You know,

1212
01:19:05,171 --> 01:19:09,880
I'm worth taking in the colors and
the forms and the sense and so on.

1213
01:19:09,881 --> 01:19:14,080
So it is,
you sit still for a few minutes,

1214
01:19:14,410 --> 01:19:18,830
come into your body as well as you
can. The breath is a very good, uh,

1215
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:23,230
homebase are anchor if you want to kind
of commonly just kind of be with the

1216
01:19:23,231 --> 01:19:25,000
breath and that's it for starters.

1217
01:19:26,250 --> 01:19:31,250
And one tips that I think you gave in
radical acceptance that I found very

1218
01:19:31,621 --> 01:19:35,970
helpful and it seems like such a, uh,
I wouldn't say trivial, I mean that,

1219
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:40,560
that minimizes it, but it seems it's
had a larger impact than I expected.

1220
01:19:40,770 --> 01:19:43,860
So when I've been told in the past like,

1221
01:19:43,861 --> 01:19:47,580
focus on your breath and
then when your mind wanders,

1222
01:19:47,581 --> 01:19:51,210
just gently bring it back to the breath.
I was like,

1223
01:19:51,211 --> 01:19:54,120
what does that mean to gently
bring it back to the breath?

1224
01:19:54,121 --> 01:19:58,110
I don't know how to do that.
What specifically are you
asking me to do? And in,

1225
01:19:58,220 --> 01:20:02,850
in a few things really helped. Uh,
one for me was focusing on the breath.

1226
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,820
I always found it and still
find it very difficult.

1227
01:20:05,821 --> 01:20:07,980
I think this is partially
because I'm a chest breather,

1228
01:20:08,430 --> 01:20:11,580
but to feel the breath in the stomach.
And I remember someone said,

1229
01:20:11,581 --> 01:20:15,270
just focus on the feeling of the breath
on the outer rim of your nostrils.

1230
01:20:15,300 --> 01:20:19,470
And I was like, what? And I started doing
that and it really worked well for me.

1231
01:20:19,471 --> 01:20:23,640
So focusing sort of on the sensation of
the breath at the very outside of the

1232
01:20:23,641 --> 01:20:25,030
nostrils,
I'm inhaling and exhaling.

1233
01:20:25,060 --> 01:20:29,040
But the point from radical acceptance
was focusing on the breath.

1234
01:20:29,610 --> 01:20:33,560
And sometimes I'll just say like
inhale XL as I'm doing that. Um,

1235
01:20:33,660 --> 01:20:36,750
and I'd like to talk about the uh,
the sort of pros and cons of,

1236
01:20:36,751 --> 01:20:39,840
of TM in a second. But the, the,

1237
01:20:39,841 --> 01:20:44,310
when I would start thinking about
something, whatever it would be a,

1238
01:20:44,311 --> 01:20:46,950
and not the breath, I would
just say thinking, thinking,

1239
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:50,880
and then come back to the breath. That
was, that sort of became my queue.

1240
01:20:50,881 --> 01:20:55,170
And I think I'm almost certain that
there were examples of that in radical

1241
01:20:55,171 --> 01:20:58,590
acceptance, but I don't want to
attribute something to you that if I'm,

1242
01:20:58,591 --> 01:21:02,220
if I'm off base, but, but I started
using that throughout the day too.

1243
01:21:02,221 --> 01:21:05,490
When I would get angry, my,
my way of, or impatient,

1244
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:10,350
my way of sort of saying Hello
Tamara would just be to say,

1245
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:15,000
hmm, impatient, impatient or angry, angry.

1246
01:21:15,510 --> 01:21:20,510
And it was just enough of a
pattern interrupt to allow
me a greater degree of of

1247
01:21:21,690 --> 01:21:25,440
of self control and more
like responsiveness,

1248
01:21:25,441 --> 01:21:27,690
choosing to respond as
opposed to being reactive.

1249
01:21:28,170 --> 01:21:33,090
Exactly. It is in radical acceptance and
it's one of the most important support

1250
01:21:33,091 --> 01:21:37,590
strategies. You know, naming are
noting what's going on. It's really,

1251
01:21:37,591 --> 01:21:38,424
really helpful.

1252
01:21:38,700 --> 01:21:43,520
So with the breath pick wherever the
breath is easiest and most pleasant did

1253
01:21:43,530 --> 01:21:47,880
attacked. So for you it might be the rim
of the nostrils is refined enough in yet

1254
01:21:47,881 --> 01:21:52,770
distinctive enough and for somebody else
feeling the whole body breathing can be

1255
01:21:52,771 --> 01:21:56,670
doing it. And for some people the
breath itself is not a good anchor.

1256
01:21:57,270 --> 01:22:01,960
I know people that have had trauma
around breathing and that's not the best

1257
01:22:01,961 --> 01:22:04,110
banker.
So listen to sound and sped,

1258
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:08,850
but you're right when the mind
wanders and you want to bring it back,

1259
01:22:08,851 --> 01:22:10,800
if you just name what's going on,

1260
01:22:11,010 --> 01:22:15,090
if you just name I was thinking or
worrying or planning or fantasizing.

1261
01:22:15,660 --> 01:22:19,500
Sometimes you can even name, which is,
you know, we call it the top, top 10 hits,

1262
01:22:19,501 --> 01:22:23,280
you know, like went to the top 10 is
going on right now. Okay. You know,

1263
01:22:23,281 --> 01:22:25,140
like basically,
you know,

1264
01:22:25,830 --> 01:22:29,550
pissed at my partner for not doing
his or her share, whatever it is.

1265
01:22:30,150 --> 01:22:33,510
You can name it and if you name it,
and here's the cool thing.

1266
01:22:33,511 --> 01:22:37,310
When you name something,
you're not as identified with it and that,

1267
01:22:37,450 --> 01:22:40,710
that's the thing, it doesn't
control you as much. There's a,

1268
01:22:40,711 --> 01:22:44,190
there's a saying that when
a sham and names a fear,

1269
01:22:44,970 --> 01:22:46,260
they have power over it.

1270
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:50,580
So when you name thinking you're
no longer in the cloud of thoughts,

1271
01:22:50,970 --> 01:22:55,920
you're opened up to something larger and
then you can choose is just not useful.

1272
01:22:55,921 --> 01:22:57,810
Or is it not often?
You know,

1273
01:22:57,811 --> 01:23:02,010
most of the time our thoughts are very
habitual and they're fear-driven and they

1274
01:23:02,011 --> 01:23:04,730
just perpetuate a sense of being,
you know,

1275
01:23:04,740 --> 01:23:08,770
a victim or being at risk or being
endangered or being stressed.

1276
01:23:08,860 --> 01:23:13,630
And if you can catch when you're in
one of those flurries and just say, Oh,

1277
01:23:13,870 --> 01:23:17,680
thinking, thinking it's,
it creates some space,

1278
01:23:17,681 --> 01:23:20,230
you can relax open
again to a bigger world.

1279
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:22,460
Well,
I also,

1280
01:23:23,460 --> 01:23:26,690
I was thinking of a quote that I
actually put in four hour work week,

1281
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:30,800
which was named must your fear
be before banish it? You can,

1282
01:23:30,801 --> 01:23:35,750
which is of course by Yoda. So if
it's good enough for you, that's good.

1283
01:23:35,820 --> 01:23:39,260
That's good. Good, good. Uh, the, the uh,

1284
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:44,570
so sitting for 10 minutes, uh, the way I
actually started it, and I know this is a,

1285
01:23:44,630 --> 01:23:46,520
it's probably a terrible bastardization,

1286
01:23:46,521 --> 01:23:48,470
but just for those people
who might find this useful,

1287
01:23:48,890 --> 01:23:52,670
a friend of mine named Komal Ravi con
actually recommended that I try this

1288
01:23:52,671 --> 01:23:56,750
because I was having so much
trouble meditating what I,

1289
01:23:57,320 --> 01:24:01,280
in a way that I could use as successful.
Right. And of course in a, in a way,

1290
01:24:01,281 --> 01:24:03,650
the people who need to meditate

1291
01:24:05,180 --> 01:24:06,800
now can say the most,

1292
01:24:06,970 --> 01:24:09,740
but are the people who are obsessed with
doing things everything successfully.

1293
01:24:10,990 --> 01:24:12,350
And yet at the same time,
they're the most,

1294
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:16,770
they might be the people most likely
to quit. So. Exactly right. And uh,

1295
01:24:16,810 --> 01:24:18,310
I remember I heard someone say,
you know,

1296
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:20,990
if you don't have 30 minutes to meditate,
you need three hours. And I was like,

1297
01:24:20,991 --> 01:24:25,160
wow, okay. But anyway, where I
was going with that is he said,

1298
01:24:25,190 --> 01:24:30,190
just pick a song you really liked that
puts you into a good mood and focus on

1299
01:24:30,471 --> 01:24:33,740
your breath while listening to that
one song first thing in the morning.

1300
01:24:33,900 --> 01:24:36,830
Like before you brush your teeth, before
you eat breakfast, but just wake up,

1301
01:24:37,490 --> 01:24:38,390
put the earbuds in,

1302
01:24:38,450 --> 01:24:43,450
sit up straight and with a good posture
against the wall if need be and just do

1303
01:24:43,551 --> 01:24:47,150
that one song that's like
your state queue. And it was,

1304
01:24:47,510 --> 01:24:51,420
I've realized that that's not something I,
uh,

1305
01:24:51,890 --> 01:24:53,390
it's not something that I use now,

1306
01:24:53,391 --> 01:24:58,340
but I found it very helpful to just
break the ice and end, have the,

1307
01:24:58,580 --> 01:25:03,350
the sitting down for three minutes,
be the pass fail mark and not

1308
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:09,080
having to jump right into the
deep end and sort of wrangle with,

1309
01:25:09,140 --> 01:25:13,010
with my thoughts quite as intensely. I
found that helpful. I know it's a crutch,

1310
01:25:13,610 --> 01:25:14,750
but um,

1311
01:25:16,090 --> 01:25:18,440
and the Buddhist tradition
they called skillful means.

1312
01:25:18,441 --> 01:25:20,780
It's like there are
things that incline us.

1313
01:25:22,340 --> 01:25:26,180
And so if the song and climbed you,
I know a woman who kept saying,

1314
01:25:26,181 --> 01:25:27,050
I don't have meditator,

1315
01:25:27,140 --> 01:25:30,140
don't have time to meditate because she
would rush rush through her morning.

1316
01:25:30,141 --> 01:25:33,140
And then she realized that
her medication time as well,

1317
01:25:33,141 --> 01:25:35,840
she was boiling water for her
tea and when she poured her cane,

1318
01:25:35,841 --> 01:25:38,510
when she drank her tea and that was
going to be her meditation. And she,

1319
01:25:39,050 --> 01:25:43,220
if you call it your meditation,
you actually, you know,

1320
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:44,880
this might not be the language you like,

1321
01:25:44,881 --> 01:25:49,881
but you create sound quality of
sacredness or specialness or importance or

1322
01:25:50,121 --> 01:25:54,350
meaning. And that's helpful.
That starts inclining you. So I,

1323
01:25:54,620 --> 01:25:58,910
I go for anything that helps
to move us towards presence.

1324
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:02,900
No, and I, I have no problem
with secretness by the way. Okay.

1325
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:04,791
That one's okay.

1326
01:26:04,791 --> 01:26:08,460
I have just such a Weirdo when it
comes to language and definitions. Uh,

1327
01:26:08,730 --> 01:26:12,260
well let me,
let me ask just before I go on one of my,

1328
01:26:12,310 --> 01:26:14,870
my massive like left turn tangents again,

1329
01:26:15,830 --> 01:26:19,120
a transcendental meditation. What,
what are your thoughts on it?

1330
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:21,140
A I n just for what it's worth,

1331
01:26:21,141 --> 01:26:25,400
I'm not a ape surest
or militants TM person.

1332
01:26:25,430 --> 01:26:27,860
It just happened to be the first
thing that I did consistently,

1333
01:26:27,861 --> 01:26:32,861
but I also do quite a lot of
their days or weeks even when I,

1334
01:26:33,930 --> 01:26:37,400
I will do what people might consider
the Pasana Meditation. But what,

1335
01:26:37,401 --> 01:26:41,020
what do you view as the pros, cons, um,

1336
01:26:41,930 --> 01:26:45,020
of say a TM and just,
just to throw it out there?

1337
01:26:45,021 --> 01:26:50,021
One of the cons for me is the fact that
in most circumstances people have to pay

1338
01:26:51,441 --> 01:26:54,770
whatever it is, 1500 bucks for
basic training and a mantra,

1339
01:26:54,771 --> 01:26:59,720
which I think is extremely cost
prohibitive for most folks. And uh,

1340
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:02,930
really had me raise a ton of red flags.

1341
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:08,500
But I found the accountability of having
a four day for lunchtime meetings in a

1342
01:27:10,851 --> 01:27:15,851
row to be necessary to get me to
comply to doing the meditation twice,

1343
01:27:16,790 --> 01:27:19,580
twice a day for four days.
And so that was the main gift.

1344
01:27:19,610 --> 01:27:21,680
It was really having a sunk cost,

1345
01:27:21,681 --> 01:27:25,550
which made me feel compelled to do it,
number one.

1346
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:28,790
And number two,
having an accountability,

1347
01:27:28,820 --> 01:27:31,550
which I think other people can probably
engineer and a million other ways.

1348
01:27:31,551 --> 01:27:34,040
But what, what are you, what
are your feelings on TM?

1349
01:27:35,270 --> 01:27:39,590
Well first a lot of people from the old
days found their way into meditation

1350
01:27:39,591 --> 01:27:43,790
through TM because it was one of the
earliest and most well known. So just,

1351
01:27:44,390 --> 01:27:45,470
you know,
we have many,

1352
01:27:45,471 --> 01:27:49,880
many people that practice
mindfulness that started with TM. So,

1353
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:51,440
and there's with every,

1354
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:56,420
I think one of the things I always have
my antennas go up on any particular

1355
01:27:56,421 --> 01:27:59,120
style claims that it's the best of the,

1356
01:28:00,190 --> 01:28:01,023
okay.

1357
01:28:01,370 --> 01:28:05,030
I have, I mean I'm very fundamentalist
about being non fundamentalists.

1358
01:28:05,031 --> 01:28:09,050
So you know, it's like that one always
gets to me because I think that different

1359
01:28:09,170 --> 01:28:13,190
personalities and temperaments benefit
from different things and clearly for you

1360
01:28:13,191 --> 01:28:17,600
having that structure.
So I like the,

1361
01:28:17,601 --> 01:28:19,940
I like that there's a
structure for some people.

1362
01:28:19,941 --> 01:28:23,760
There's different styles of
that structure. Um, I too,

1363
01:28:23,820 --> 01:28:26,630
I offer everything,
all my meditations for free.

1364
01:28:26,690 --> 01:28:30,090
And I just feel like this
came to me, you know, it's,

1365
01:28:30,120 --> 01:28:33,350
this is given from the universe and
I want to give it back and, and I,

1366
01:28:33,590 --> 01:28:38,180
so I like whenever possible ought to have
to charge for something in this domain

1367
01:28:38,181 --> 01:28:40,250
of waking up.
So that always,

1368
01:28:40,710 --> 01:28:45,440
and I also like that it'd be
very available to populations
that are underserved

1369
01:28:45,441 --> 01:28:48,410
or can't afford it.
So that's another piece.

1370
01:28:48,411 --> 01:28:53,411
But in terms of the actual meditation
TM is as primarily a concentrative

1371
01:28:54,291 --> 01:28:54,800
practice.

1372
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:59,090
You're taking a mantra or a set of
say could words and repeating them and

1373
01:28:59,091 --> 01:29:04,020
repeating them. And the benefit of
which is a narrowing of the Lens.

1374
01:29:04,050 --> 01:29:09,050
So focus is that actually collects the
attention and the mind gets quiet and

1375
01:29:09,451 --> 01:29:10,470
when the mind is quiet,

1376
01:29:10,710 --> 01:29:15,450
there can be experiences of bliss and
serenity and peace and so on. So that,

1377
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:20,100
that's what TM does. It gives
you a break from that, uh,

1378
01:29:20,250 --> 01:29:22,920
incessant inner dialogue.
And the more you practice it,

1379
01:29:22,950 --> 01:29:27,600
the more easily it is to collect the mind.
Now,

1380
01:29:27,601 --> 01:29:28,710
there are other ways.

1381
01:29:28,930 --> 01:29:32,550
There are other focuses for
concentration other than a TM mantra.

1382
01:29:32,551 --> 01:29:35,940
But that that's the way cam works for me.

1383
01:29:35,941 --> 01:29:40,941
The limitation is it doesn't allow
you to see into the nature of reality.

1384
01:29:43,530 --> 01:29:48,530
And by that I mean it doesn't bring a
kind of presence that allows you to sense

1385
01:29:49,501 --> 01:29:51,120
what's actually happening.
Now,

1386
01:29:51,870 --> 01:29:55,320
most of our understanding of
reality is conceptual. We, you know,

1387
01:29:55,321 --> 01:29:59,380
we have ideas about things and
to really have a, you know,

1388
01:29:59,710 --> 01:30:04,440
a clear, penetrating insight,
um, we need to be present.

1389
01:30:04,441 --> 01:30:08,040
And Tm doesn't,
it's like it aims the mind at something,

1390
01:30:08,041 --> 01:30:11,760
but it doesn't open the attention
so that whatever arises,

1391
01:30:12,180 --> 01:30:14,760
you start learning how to be with it.
And to me,

1392
01:30:14,761 --> 01:30:19,761
the power and freedom of mindfulness
is you start getting the knack of being

1393
01:30:21,691 --> 01:30:23,250
with whatever arises.

1394
01:30:23,850 --> 01:30:28,300
And one of the things I'm very aware of
is that most of us are, you know, we,

1395
01:30:28,350 --> 01:30:32,160
we were aware of our mortality and
we're tensing against what can go wrong.

1396
01:30:32,340 --> 01:30:36,630
And so we go around our day and in some
way there's this tension about what's

1397
01:30:36,631 --> 01:30:41,100
around the corner that might
be overwhelming and we're
not always aware of that

1398
01:30:41,101 --> 01:30:41,760
tension,

1399
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:46,760
but it stops us from fully savoring and
luxuriating and being creative and alive

1400
01:30:47,671 --> 01:30:51,210
in the moment and what train,
what d conditions.

1401
01:30:51,211 --> 01:30:56,211
That tension is when we unconditionally
open to the life that's right here and

1402
01:30:57,571 --> 01:31:02,280
we don't resist it. And we realized that
wow, there is space for what's here.

1403
01:31:02,310 --> 01:31:05,100
Even when it's unpleasant.
Even when we're,

1404
01:31:05,340 --> 01:31:07,800
even when we're sensing
a dying of some short,

1405
01:31:08,730 --> 01:31:13,730
to me the gift of meditation
is it actually teaches us
how to be with living and

1406
01:31:13,891 --> 01:31:16,350
dying. And so I don't, I don't feel that,

1407
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:21,560
I think TM offers a support in
one part of a meditation training,

1408
01:31:22,111 --> 01:31:23,970
but it doesn't go the whole way.

1409
01:31:25,100 --> 01:31:29,020
What, what, uh, suicides
from your own books,

1410
01:31:29,021 --> 01:31:32,920
which I recommend to everyone
listening a few things.

1411
01:31:32,950 --> 01:31:37,950
If people want it to start with two or
three of your guided meditations and

1412
01:31:38,681 --> 01:31:41,320
they've, they, they viewed themselves as

1413
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:45,700
sort of stubborn,
a driven types,

1414
01:31:47,620 --> 01:31:50,950
which, which meditations might
you suggest that they start with?

1415
01:31:52,090 --> 01:31:53,370
Well on my website,

1416
01:31:53,371 --> 01:31:58,371
there's a a landing page for a guided
meditations and they're all you,

1417
01:31:59,230 --> 01:32:03,490
they're all free and they usually are
anywhere from 12 minutes to, you know,

1418
01:32:03,610 --> 01:32:08,050
25 minutes and you can start
them. And, and this, you know,

1419
01:32:08,490 --> 01:32:08,830
they,

1420
01:32:08,830 --> 01:32:12,430
they start off with really guiding us
into presence and then they keep going.

1421
01:32:12,431 --> 01:32:16,090
You can even stop them. Um, I
would use one of the featured ones.

1422
01:32:16,390 --> 01:32:21,250
Those are the ones that
are most generically useful
but also just play around.

1423
01:32:21,880 --> 01:32:26,880
It really helps to have guided meditations
to begin because you'll eventually

1424
01:32:27,191 --> 01:32:32,070
internalize, you'll get an inner
meditation teacher, you know, but here,

1425
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:35,230
but hearing it and hearing kind
of a few different versions,

1426
01:32:35,470 --> 01:32:37,480
we'll give you a sense of
what works best for you.

1427
01:32:37,510 --> 01:32:41,650
Cause sometimes I'll emphasize
how to relax through the body.

1428
01:32:41,740 --> 01:32:44,620
And sometimes I'll emphasize how
to really collect with the breath.

1429
01:32:44,980 --> 01:32:48,610
And other times, meditations on
self compassion or forgiveness.

1430
01:32:48,611 --> 01:32:53,320
So there's a lot of different
styles and types to play with.

1431
01:32:53,670 --> 01:32:54,880
And what is your website?

1432
01:32:56,020 --> 01:32:57,520
It's Tara brock.com.

1433
01:32:57,890 --> 01:33:01,160
Yeah, that's, that's straight and simple.
And I'll put that in the show notes.

1434
01:33:01,190 --> 01:33:05,840
Everybody as well as, uh, other
links to resources and so on. The,

1435
01:33:06,030 --> 01:33:10,340
uh, do you have, so the rolling stones
have, let's say, satisfaction, right?

1436
01:33:10,910 --> 01:33:13,490
Everybody knows satisfaction, they
love it. It's a crowd pleaser.

1437
01:33:13,610 --> 01:33:18,610
Are there any of those meditations that
are kind of like your satisfaction?

1438
01:33:20,450 --> 01:33:21,290
Are there any,
uh,

1439
01:33:21,530 --> 01:33:24,980
are there any the that appear to resonate
with a higher percentage of people

1440
01:33:24,981 --> 01:33:27,200
than others?
And of course I'll encourage people to,

1441
01:33:28,130 --> 01:33:31,430
people are going to be hopefully
enjoying these for more than one day,

1442
01:33:31,431 --> 01:33:35,600
so they can test quite a few. But if
you, if you had to give your, your, uh,

1443
01:33:36,050 --> 01:33:38,240
your hits,
what might those be?

1444
01:33:38,810 --> 01:33:41,690
Well, the name I've, I
don't remember the names,

1445
01:33:41,691 --> 01:33:46,691
but I have featured meditations on the
landing page for guided meditations and

1446
01:33:47,480 --> 01:33:52,250
just choose it according to Lens because
there's pretty much the same content in

1447
01:33:52,251 --> 01:33:56,180
them. So got it. But the right there
and there, they're easy to find.

1448
01:33:56,540 --> 01:34:00,200
And then there's also
the audio talks page,

1449
01:34:00,201 --> 01:34:04,850
which gives the kind of background of
understandings and so on that really

1450
01:34:04,851 --> 01:34:08,720
helped us to not only start a
practice but and sustain it,

1451
01:34:08,721 --> 01:34:12,820
but really bring it into our lives.
Because the big deal, I mean, you know,

1452
01:34:12,830 --> 01:34:14,390
everybody talks about sitting practice.

1453
01:34:14,450 --> 01:34:19,450
The really the big deal is can you and
I be talking right now and still have

1454
01:34:20,090 --> 01:34:24,860
that quality of remembrance where
we're in touch with what matters,

1455
01:34:24,861 --> 01:34:29,480
where we're embodied enough so we
can feel feelings. You know, we,

1456
01:34:29,750 --> 01:34:32,530
we tend to cut off so,
uh,

1457
01:34:32,570 --> 01:34:35,600
habitually in our lives and
as you described earlier,

1458
01:34:35,601 --> 01:34:40,220
we're so plugged into so many
different virtual realities that, um,

1459
01:34:40,580 --> 01:34:45,580
to me the big challenge and invitation
is can we get more real and alive in our

1460
01:34:47,870 --> 01:34:51,830
day unless habituated and less automatic.
And so that's the carryover.

1461
01:34:53,580 --> 01:34:55,270
Outside of your own books,
what's,

1462
01:34:55,650 --> 01:35:00,650
say two to three books for people who
want to delve further into meditation,

1463
01:35:01,641 --> 01:35:05,480
mindfulness, et Cetera, are there any
other books that you would recommend?

1464
01:35:07,320 --> 01:35:11,820
Well, Jack Kornfield, who I teach with
a lot and love is a very good friend.

1465
01:35:12,140 --> 01:35:14,640
Um,
has a couple of books that are very good.

1466
01:35:14,780 --> 01:35:17,250
His is classic is a path with heart.

1467
01:35:19,830 --> 01:35:24,060
And the other book that
is is I think wonderful.

1468
01:35:24,061 --> 01:35:27,480
I loved Pema Chodron and
Pema Chodron has her,

1469
01:35:27,510 --> 01:35:30,570
one of her classics is
when things fall apart.

1470
01:35:32,730 --> 01:35:36,870
So those are,
those are two right there that really,

1471
01:35:37,020 --> 01:35:40,800
really helped, you know, helped
me guide into the practices and,

1472
01:35:40,840 --> 01:35:43,110
and really help heal the heart.

1473
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:45,940
Is, uh, and this is,

1474
01:35:46,120 --> 01:35:50,080
this does not have to be specific to
meditation and Buddhism or anything like

1475
01:35:50,081 --> 01:35:53,020
that,
but what book have you gifted the most to?

1476
01:35:53,021 --> 01:35:55,620
Other people or books

1477
01:35:58,250 --> 01:36:01,340
might have to come back to that.
Cause I sometimes I'll just,

1478
01:36:01,400 --> 01:36:03,140
I gift the essential roommate,

1479
01:36:03,141 --> 01:36:06,940
which is a collection of poetry
that Coleman Barks at, um,

1480
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:11,840
I think is really, really beautiful
or poetry by the poet pace.

1481
01:36:13,190 --> 01:36:18,140
So sometimes it'll be poetry books
at all, all gasped. Um, you know,

1482
01:36:18,141 --> 01:36:20,240
I really value Eckhart Tolle,

1483
01:36:20,300 --> 01:36:23,600
totally his books and I think he's
done a great job. I think I'd just,

1484
01:36:23,601 --> 01:36:28,310
Shanti's done fabulously
even more with his, his, um,

1485
01:36:28,340 --> 01:36:32,900
audio, you know, his, his talks and
even as books, but it's books, author,

1486
01:36:32,901 --> 01:36:36,090
Wonderful Haji Ashanti.

1487
01:36:36,170 --> 01:36:41,040
It's a d y, a shanty.

1488
01:36:41,060 --> 01:36:44,030
S. H. A. N. T. I

1489
01:36:44,520 --> 01:36:47,070
what is Shanti mean because I've,
I've,

1490
01:36:47,100 --> 01:36:49,860
I've seen this word pop up quite a lot.

1491
01:36:50,760 --> 01:36:55,680
I'm looking it up right here.
Pcs piece. Ah, there we go.

1492
01:36:56,200 --> 01:37:00,450
You beat me to it. You'd beat me to
it. All right. Uh, well that's a,

1493
01:37:00,510 --> 01:37:03,410
that's a good word. He is, uh, the, the,

1494
01:37:03,590 --> 01:37:07,370
the beginning of your day.
We talked about the,

1495
01:37:07,810 --> 01:37:12,630
the hike first thing with the
dog, the standing meditation. Uh,

1496
01:37:12,750 --> 01:37:16,440
and then, then what is your, what
does your day look like at that point?

1497
01:37:17,130 --> 01:37:17,963
After that?

1498
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:23,120
Well, it varies. Can like most people have
some traveling and teaching, you know,

1499
01:37:23,121 --> 01:37:27,050
cause I, I teach different centers
around the country and some in Europe.

1500
01:37:27,051 --> 01:37:28,430
Then I'm out and about.

1501
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:31,170
But say you're at home and you
can do whatever you want. Yeah.

1502
01:37:31,990 --> 01:37:33,110
That's when I'm happiest.

1503
01:37:33,470 --> 01:37:35,190
Yeah.
Your hair.

1504
01:37:35,950 --> 01:37:40,570
Yeah. Well. Um, usually that
means that I am writing,

1505
01:37:40,630 --> 01:37:45,400
I am component putting together
talk and um, cause I do it,

1506
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:47,050
it's like being a minister.

1507
01:37:47,051 --> 01:37:50,380
I do my weekly talk and that's kind
of where a lot of my energy goes.

1508
01:37:50,740 --> 01:37:55,150
But I'm also involved with, uh, we have a
meditation community here in Washington.

1509
01:37:55,680 --> 01:38:00,420
A lot of socially engaged
action initiatives are going on.

1510
01:38:00,421 --> 01:38:03,290
So I'm involved with projects like,
uh,

1511
01:38:03,300 --> 01:38:08,300
we were bringing mindfulness into the
schools in the area and that's it.

1512
01:38:08,440 --> 01:38:11,250
That's kind of amazing.
I mean,

1513
01:38:11,251 --> 01:38:14,330
just to imagine this next generation,
um,

1514
01:38:14,670 --> 01:38:19,670
training their attention so they're
able to be more collaborative so they're

1515
01:38:20,851 --> 01:38:24,780
able to be more emotionally intelligent
so they're able to find their center.

1516
01:38:24,781 --> 01:38:26,850
So that, that one really
excites me at night. You know,

1517
01:38:26,851 --> 01:38:30,800
spent some time working on that.
In fact,

1518
01:38:31,080 --> 01:38:34,800
the Congressman Tim Ryan and I've done
a number of presentations in the area,

1519
01:38:35,130 --> 01:38:37,820
two different schools
that, uh, and, and it's,

1520
01:38:38,160 --> 01:38:41,790
there's thousands of kids in the area
that have now been taking mindfulness

1521
01:38:41,791 --> 01:38:45,690
courses. So that's just an example
of something I'd be working on

1522
01:38:46,260 --> 01:38:46,531
that.

1523
01:38:46,531 --> 01:38:51,350
Is there a dedicated website for that
or can people find more information on

1524
01:38:51,351 --> 01:38:51,770
your own?

1525
01:38:51,770 --> 01:38:53,620
Yeah, well, um,

1526
01:38:54,770 --> 01:38:59,540
mine's m I N D s is the group that,
um,

1527
01:38:59,750 --> 01:39:04,750
that I've been advising and that's
affiliated with us and I think it's,

1528
01:39:05,990 --> 01:39:06,580
you know,
I'll,

1529
01:39:06,580 --> 01:39:10,490
I'll let you know before the end because
I'd love people to check it out there.

1530
01:39:10,940 --> 01:39:14,660
It's amazing what they're doing, the
kind of work they're doing. And in fact,

1531
01:39:14,661 --> 01:39:19,230
I'll tell you about one project that I,
that I really love, which is that, um, I,

1532
01:39:19,390 --> 01:39:22,970
I mentioned that Jack Kornfield and I are
collaborating on this mindful for day.

1533
01:39:22,971 --> 01:39:26,900
There's 40 day program.
Well we're mines has,

1534
01:39:27,170 --> 01:39:32,150
we're affiliated with mines
and we're going to be working
in one of very diverse,

1535
01:39:32,151 --> 01:39:36,200
very underserved,
very large high school in the DC area.

1536
01:39:36,740 --> 01:39:40,610
And we're going to bring mindfulness
to all parts of it. In other words,

1537
01:39:40,670 --> 01:39:45,670
they're going to do the training with
the kids and Jack and I are the this

1538
01:39:45,741 --> 01:39:50,741
online program or have all the faculty
and Admin and parents are going to be a

1539
01:39:52,450 --> 01:39:55,670
of the group that we work with.
They're going to be taking it.

1540
01:39:55,671 --> 01:39:59,510
And we've got on the
ground mentors. So, um,

1541
01:39:59,750 --> 01:40:04,430
the idea is to see if we can change the
whole culture of the school by bringing

1542
01:40:04,431 --> 01:40:09,431
the sand and there's so much research
now showing the beneficial effects for

1543
01:40:10,641 --> 01:40:11,980
kids that,
um,

1544
01:40:12,500 --> 01:40:17,300
but to have the parents also to
me is what's exciting. So we've,

1545
01:40:17,450 --> 01:40:22,450
we've been able to get some revenue enough
to get the first round going on this

1546
01:40:22,581 --> 01:40:23,414
and uh,

1547
01:40:23,960 --> 01:40:27,140
and I think it's going to be a very
cool pilot that can be done elsewhere in

1548
01:40:27,141 --> 01:40:28,610
other school systems.

1549
01:40:29,150 --> 01:40:31,460
Cool. I love, I love these types of,

1550
01:40:31,510 --> 01:40:36,510
of pilots because they can really set a
precedent and provide a case study that

1551
01:40:37,821 --> 01:40:39,500
people can replicate. So, uh,

1552
01:40:39,680 --> 01:40:44,270
I will put that whether we get to it
today while we're talking or afterwards,

1553
01:40:44,271 --> 01:40:47,180
but for everybody listening all to
put a link to that in the show notes,

1554
01:40:47,790 --> 01:40:52,640
I would like to ask a very self
interested personal question,

1555
01:40:53,500 --> 01:40:57,850
uh, in that is that I think also applies
to a lot of people listening to this.

1556
01:40:57,851 --> 01:40:59,740
So the,

1557
01:40:59,770 --> 01:41:03,910
if I look at my circle of
friends in Silicon Valley,

1558
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,190
if I look at my circle
of friends in New York,

1559
01:41:06,191 --> 01:41:10,120
and certainly I think in many other
cities around the world or just in many

1560
01:41:10,121 --> 01:41:14,230
other places around the world,
there is an increasing,

1561
01:41:14,840 --> 01:41:15,673
uh,

1562
01:41:17,090 --> 01:41:21,890
severe problem with Fomo as we
call it here. Fear of missing out.

1563
01:41:21,980 --> 01:41:25,160
So this, this can manifest
itself in many different ways.

1564
01:41:25,460 --> 01:41:29,750
People feel like they can't stay away
from email for 30 minutes because they'll

1565
01:41:29,751 --> 01:41:33,020
get backlogged and there's a
fear of missing either a problem.

1566
01:41:33,021 --> 01:41:36,440
We were missing some type of opportunity.
Uh, in my particular case, you know,

1567
01:41:36,470 --> 01:41:39,860
I've talked to a number of friends
of mine who are involved with startup

1568
01:41:39,861 --> 01:41:43,280
investing and whatnot about
taking a startup vacation.

1569
01:41:43,281 --> 01:41:44,870
I would like to take a three month,

1570
01:41:45,140 --> 01:41:49,940
100% vacation from new startup
investments because it's become,

1571
01:41:50,230 --> 01:41:52,880
uh,
something of a source of stress for me.

1572
01:41:52,881 --> 01:41:56,220
I think things were very
unstable right now and uh,

1573
01:41:56,720 --> 01:42:00,740
irrational and the,
the feedback almost universally has been

1574
01:42:02,270 --> 01:42:03,290
you shouldn't do that.

1575
01:42:03,500 --> 01:42:07,550
Don't make any kind of public proclamation
because then you'll stop seeing deals.

1576
01:42:07,551 --> 01:42:08,331
And then before you know it,

1577
01:42:08,331 --> 01:42:10,550
you'll be out of the loop and then you
won't be able to get back into it when

1578
01:42:10,551 --> 01:42:13,970
you want to get back into it.
So this is very, and that,

1579
01:42:14,810 --> 01:42:15,300
okay,

1580
01:42:15,300 --> 01:42:17,780
as you might imagine, puts
me on edge because I, I,

1581
01:42:17,900 --> 01:42:22,860
I found that there are certain things
that I feel I need to categorically say no

1582
01:42:22,861 --> 01:42:26,430
to. Even if just for a period
of time I can't do it 80%.

1583
01:42:26,490 --> 01:42:29,280
If I tried to do at 80%,
then I'll look at everything in it.

1584
01:42:29,330 --> 01:42:33,550
It just becomes a self
defeating. Right. It did.

1585
01:42:33,551 --> 01:42:36,510
Did I won't make any progress.
So how would you,

1586
01:42:37,380 --> 01:42:41,040
how would you think about or
encouraged people to think about this?

1587
01:42:41,041 --> 01:42:44,760
This fear of missing out where they feel
like they constantly have to be in the

1588
01:42:44,761 --> 01:42:47,940
loop. We're accessible or
fill in the blank because it,

1589
01:42:47,941 --> 01:42:52,590
it seems to be a huge
source of stress for, uh,

1590
01:42:52,650 --> 01:42:53,910
for almost everyone that I know.

1591
01:42:54,930 --> 01:42:55,471
You're right.

1592
01:42:55,471 --> 01:43:00,471
And I think it's getting more so because
of the degree of the Internet and plug

1593
01:43:00,991 --> 01:43:04,020
it, cause we're always plugged
in on so many levels. You know,

1594
01:43:04,021 --> 01:43:05,900
the book the shallows and
did you read that right?

1595
01:43:06,050 --> 01:43:07,010
No,
I don't actually

1596
01:43:07,860 --> 01:43:09,240
can't remember the name of the author,

1597
01:43:09,241 --> 01:43:14,160
but it's really describing her technology
actually shapes and changes our brain.

1598
01:43:14,280 --> 01:43:16,350
And you know,
whether it's the,

1599
01:43:16,530 --> 01:43:20,340
the onset of typewriter changing
cause instead of handwriting,

1600
01:43:20,460 --> 01:43:23,250
which brings out a certain part
of our brain, um, you know,

1601
01:43:23,251 --> 01:43:26,310
having a typewriter but being
plugged in all the time,

1602
01:43:26,311 --> 01:43:30,000
our brain is changing and we're actually
taking it a lot more information,

1603
01:43:30,001 --> 01:43:33,030
but it a lot more of a shallow level,
not so dimensional.

1604
01:43:33,031 --> 01:43:38,031
And we've lost our capacity to actually
immerse and drop into the deeper,

1605
01:43:38,611 --> 01:43:40,140
more subtle dimensions of things.

1606
01:43:40,141 --> 01:43:44,940
It's actually a change in the brain
that people that used to be, um,

1607
01:43:44,970 --> 01:43:48,870
very avid deep readers just
can't get themselves to,

1608
01:43:48,871 --> 01:43:52,340
there's a kind of attention deficits
when it comes to certain things.

1609
01:43:52,341 --> 01:43:56,960
And what the Internet promote is the
sense of missing out because there's so

1610
01:43:56,961 --> 01:44:00,860
much coming in from so many different
angles so that you always got the sense

1611
01:44:00,861 --> 01:44:01,770
that you're missing it.

1612
01:44:01,970 --> 01:44:06,410
That there's just something else that
you need to be plugged into. And,

1613
01:44:06,900 --> 01:44:11,240
and one of my favorite little cartoons
of this man and a woman sitting in the

1614
01:44:11,241 --> 01:44:16,040
living room and he sang to her, you
know, if I ever become a vegetable,

1615
01:44:16,041 --> 01:44:19,940
just pulled the plug at which point she
goes over the TV set and she hangs out

1616
01:44:19,941 --> 01:44:23,900
the plug. And, and what I like
about it, it's just like we're,

1617
01:44:24,440 --> 01:44:28,400
we get, we get into kind
of an existential anxiety,

1618
01:44:28,520 --> 01:44:30,020
oh my not plugged in.

1619
01:44:30,050 --> 01:44:33,980
Like the world is moving on
without us and how to deal with it.

1620
01:44:34,130 --> 01:44:37,670
The first is what you're doing,
which is name it, name it,

1621
01:44:37,820 --> 01:44:41,340
and really get that this is
a product of the Times that,

1622
01:44:41,510 --> 01:44:45,200
that we're at a very speedy time,
the end.

1623
01:44:45,201 --> 01:44:49,490
And it's accelerating. Where,
um, you know, there's like a,

1624
01:44:49,910 --> 01:44:54,260
there's a relationship with the, the
Chinese word for buisiness that has to,

1625
01:44:54,440 --> 01:44:56,870
that's in relationship.
The heart killing.

1626
01:44:57,520 --> 01:45:01,820
Yeah. The speedier we get.
Yeah. You could feel it.

1627
01:45:01,870 --> 01:45:05,390
The left side of the character means
heart and the right side means death. Yup.

1628
01:45:06,040 --> 01:45:07,020
It's amazing.
Amazing.

1629
01:45:07,020 --> 01:45:10,620
And so I can say for myself
to him that when I'm in my,

1630
01:45:10,860 --> 01:45:14,610
like that fear of not being
prepared or the fear of missing out,

1631
01:45:15,390 --> 01:45:19,050
my heart's not so open. If my son
calls and I'm in the middle of it,

1632
01:45:19,530 --> 01:45:24,530
I really am not able to take in him
what's really going on for him because

1633
01:45:25,051 --> 01:45:28,500
there's some part of me that's
tense and on my way somewhere else.

1634
01:45:29,130 --> 01:45:31,890
So it feels like first of all,

1635
01:45:31,891 --> 01:45:36,891
to have the aspiration to be free
from that trance is the first step to

1636
01:45:37,201 --> 01:45:42,120
recognize what's going on and
know that you can be a more full,

1637
01:45:42,121 --> 01:45:43,230
more productive,

1638
01:45:43,231 --> 01:45:47,940
more wheel being when you're not
constantly being tugged around by that

1639
01:45:47,941 --> 01:45:52,440
something more or something else. And
then the second piece is, you know,

1640
01:45:52,500 --> 01:45:57,060
if I think of people that are really
good teachers or people that are really

1641
01:45:57,061 --> 01:46:00,990
good writers, people that
really have done the music that,

1642
01:46:01,080 --> 01:46:05,310
that those two people saw,
they retreat,

1643
01:46:05,820 --> 01:46:10,140
they, they unplug, they take space,

1644
01:46:10,620 --> 01:46:10,931
the,

1645
01:46:10,931 --> 01:46:15,931
the step out of the dizziness and allow
an open themselves to something bigger,

1646
01:46:17,020 --> 01:46:22,020
something wide or something more
mysterious and fluid and order for that to

1647
01:46:22,681 --> 01:46:24,300
happen.
And for you,

1648
01:46:24,360 --> 01:46:28,290
and I feel us in particular
for you because I feel like
you're, you've got, um,

1649
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:33,400
you're very plugged in to the pulse and
a very good way and your sensitivity and

1650
01:46:35,011 --> 01:46:39,790
attunement, we'll get even deeper if
you could take sabbaticals. Agreed.

1651
01:46:40,620 --> 01:46:45,450
Because it, what'll happen is it'll
break. We all get habitual to some degree.

1652
01:46:46,050 --> 01:46:46,741
And the trick is,

1653
01:46:46,741 --> 01:46:51,741
can we keep on recognizing and out of
any of the habits that stop us from being

1654
01:46:52,650 --> 01:46:56,310
as sensitive and attuned as possible?
And,

1655
01:46:56,330 --> 01:46:58,530
and so you need a sabbatical to do that.

1656
01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:02,400
And what,

1657
01:47:03,230 --> 01:47:06,470
how would you contend with the,

1658
01:47:07,100 --> 01:47:08,840
the fear of that,

1659
01:47:09,230 --> 01:47:13,820
the unintended side effects of that
sabbatical? Right. So for the free,

1660
01:47:14,480 --> 01:47:17,000
right. So the friends I have, we're
like, dude, you can't do that.

1661
01:47:17,001 --> 01:47:19,610
If you make some kind of crazy public,

1662
01:47:20,210 --> 01:47:25,210
a proclamation or put out a blog post
about how you're taking a x month startup

1663
01:47:25,281 --> 01:47:26,114
vacation,

1664
01:47:26,540 --> 01:47:30,930
you have no idea what kind of cascade of
events you're going to trigger like you,

1665
01:47:31,160 --> 01:47:33,140
you're going to be and blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1666
01:47:33,141 --> 01:47:36,860
So there's this kind of fear
mongering fearmongering that, uh,

1667
01:47:36,861 --> 01:47:38,660
I'd love your thoughts
on how to contend with,

1668
01:47:39,290 --> 01:47:42,890
first of all,
part of who you are,

1669
01:47:43,010 --> 01:47:46,820
10 is don't, you guys don't have to
try it out. I'll go ahead and try it.

1670
01:47:47,410 --> 01:47:51,530
All right. You know what's on the other
side? So part of it is just knowing that,

1671
01:47:52,260 --> 01:47:56,780
well, let me put it this way, there's a
palliative caregiver who said, you know,

1672
01:47:56,810 --> 01:47:59,570
who was with thousands of
people when they're dying.

1673
01:47:59,571 --> 01:48:03,870
And she said the greatest regret of the
dying is not living true to ourselves is

1674
01:48:03,871 --> 01:48:08,120
that we're living according to the
expectations or the cultural fears or

1675
01:48:08,121 --> 01:48:08,954
whatever.

1676
01:48:09,200 --> 01:48:13,730
So your whole path is about
playing the edge and not buying in.

1677
01:48:14,270 --> 01:48:19,270
And part of what that means is that
you're willing to feel the fear but not be

1678
01:48:19,581 --> 01:48:22,520
driven by it, right?
So that's where we get,

1679
01:48:22,760 --> 01:48:26,360
here's now we're coming back to
having tea with Mara for you.

1680
01:48:26,361 --> 01:48:31,090
It's go ahead and say, I'm,
I'm, I'm stepping back. I,

1681
01:48:31,390 --> 01:48:35,480
I'm taking a sabbatical from, you
know, whatever, whatever it is,

1682
01:48:35,960 --> 01:48:40,010
and then your process and it's an
important process. It's not like,

1683
01:48:40,100 --> 01:48:43,280
I wish I could sidestep this so I
could actually have my sabbatical.

1684
01:48:43,700 --> 01:48:47,310
Part of it is you are learning how to,
uh,

1685
01:48:47,690 --> 01:48:52,690
find your peace and balance and ease
in the midst of those energies of fear.

1686
01:48:53,770 --> 01:48:54,603
Right?

1687
01:48:55,370 --> 01:49:00,030
One of the interesting things to me is
that if you go to, in Asia, there's these,

1688
01:49:00,080 --> 01:49:03,080
uh, Mondalez, which are, you know,

1689
01:49:03,210 --> 01:49:05,970
filled with images and right at
the center of them a sacred space.

1690
01:49:06,030 --> 01:49:09,120
And in order to get to sacred space,

1691
01:49:09,121 --> 01:49:13,290
you have to pass through what are
called the animal headed goddesses.

1692
01:49:13,291 --> 01:49:18,291
And they're really fear and anger and
hatred and jealousy and point isn't that

1693
01:49:19,201 --> 01:49:23,550
you get the only way to sacred
space to encounter these energies,

1694
01:49:23,610 --> 01:49:26,760
but the,
with them not try to sidestep them.

1695
01:49:27,300 --> 01:49:31,710
So it's almost like it
is the path to face fear.

1696
01:49:32,220 --> 01:49:36,270
And then there's the question of well
how do we do that in a way that actually

1697
01:49:36,600 --> 01:49:39,550
feeds us and not freeze up know.

1698
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:41,713
And um,

1699
01:49:41,880 --> 01:49:46,620
for me the way that I work with here
is there's a difference by the way,

1700
01:49:46,621 --> 01:49:51,160
between traumatic here and the kind of
fear we're talking about. Definitely.

1701
01:49:51,550 --> 01:49:54,370
Okay. So with non traumatic
fear, and by the way,

1702
01:49:54,371 --> 01:49:59,371
I'm doing a whole online course
on working with here in the fall,

1703
01:50:00,071 --> 01:50:01,090
which you know,
I'll,

1704
01:50:01,240 --> 01:50:06,240
I'll tell you more about because I feel
like for almost everyone I know really

1705
01:50:07,121 --> 01:50:08,920
what's going to free us most.

1706
01:50:08,921 --> 01:50:13,000
What's going to bring out most of our
creativity and most let us be intimate in

1707
01:50:13,001 --> 01:50:17,740
the world is to really learn how to work
with the fears that we run away from.

1708
01:50:18,550 --> 01:50:19,570
And in fact,
there's one,

1709
01:50:19,660 --> 01:50:23,380
one mystic who says there's only
one really good question, which is,

1710
01:50:23,410 --> 01:50:25,710
what am I unwilling to feel?
Okay,

1711
01:50:26,780 --> 01:50:27,613
that's a good one.

1712
01:50:28,890 --> 01:50:33,360
And fears what were unwilling to hear.
So it's like, to become fearless,

1713
01:50:33,361 --> 01:50:37,380
you need to feel fear and
be willing to be vulnerable,

1714
01:50:37,470 --> 01:50:41,040
be willing to have everybody tell
you, hey, you know, you're going to,

1715
01:50:41,041 --> 01:50:44,340
you're going to go offline and then you're
going to miss something to be willing

1716
01:50:44,341 --> 01:50:47,250
to feel that vulnerability
but not be driven by it.

1717
01:50:47,980 --> 01:50:50,800
Well, that's me. Reminds me
of, I'm paraphrasing of course,

1718
01:50:50,801 --> 01:50:54,400
but what Mike Tyson's trainer,
custom auto said in his,

1719
01:50:55,240 --> 01:50:56,680
at his peak,

1720
01:50:56,770 --> 01:51:01,390
which was the hero and the coward feel
the same thing. It's what the hero,

1721
01:51:01,420 --> 01:51:02,950
the hero does that makes them different.

1722
01:51:04,320 --> 01:51:07,090
And because Tyson was,

1723
01:51:07,150 --> 01:51:11,340
was terrified before getting
to the ring, oftentimes, uh,

1724
01:51:11,570 --> 01:51:16,030
just hard to imagine.
But true. Uh, the, um,

1725
01:51:17,200 --> 01:51:20,650
I like this. Yeah. I need to think,

1726
01:51:20,680 --> 01:51:25,480
make a couple of pretty big moves,
which, uh, which I've been meditating on,

1727
01:51:25,510 --> 01:51:28,880
but, uh, I've, I've been
frozen and not fried,

1728
01:51:28,910 --> 01:51:31,510
so I need to pull the
trigger on a few of those.

1729
01:51:31,511 --> 01:51:36,310
I think if you could have
a billboard anywhere, uh,

1730
01:51:36,370 --> 01:51:40,450
and you could have it say anything
that you liked, what, what a,

1731
01:51:40,451 --> 01:51:41,740
what would it say and where would it be?

1732
01:51:42,970 --> 01:51:47,970
It let's say realize and
live the loving awareness.

1733
01:51:49,751 --> 01:51:50,940
That's really who you are.

1734
01:51:52,690 --> 01:51:53,560
Where would you put that?

1735
01:51:55,290 --> 01:51:56,800
I'm not sure.

1736
01:51:57,540 --> 01:52:01,770
You know, where do you put it? Yeah,

1737
01:52:03,030 --> 01:52:07,290
sure. I put it inside everyone's
heart and mind. It's like,

1738
01:52:07,620 --> 01:52:08,460
I feel like,
you know,

1739
01:52:08,760 --> 01:52:11,820
the Buddha said it pretty
elegantly that if you're suffering,

1740
01:52:11,850 --> 01:52:15,750
it's because you're forgetting who
you are. You're, you're living in a,

1741
01:52:15,751 --> 01:52:17,160
in a smaller narrative.

1742
01:52:17,820 --> 01:52:21,410
And that really each of our jobs
is to start recognizing how, what,

1743
01:52:21,460 --> 01:52:23,460
what am I believing?
It's limiting me.

1744
01:52:23,850 --> 01:52:27,390
What am I believing that's
keeping me small, separate,

1745
01:52:27,690 --> 01:52:30,900
either feeling deficient, are
feeling superior? Because, you know,

1746
01:52:30,901 --> 01:52:33,120
I talk about the trance of unworthiness,

1747
01:52:33,600 --> 01:52:38,600
that I can honestly say that I am as
much in the chance trance of specialness,

1748
01:52:38,821 --> 01:52:42,210
his unworthiness, and both of
them caused stuff, you know?

1749
01:52:43,100 --> 01:52:43,930
Right.
No,

1750
01:52:43,930 --> 01:52:44,770
it's,
it's,

1751
01:52:44,990 --> 01:52:49,580
it's about really waking up and realizing
that there's a basic goodness here.

1752
01:52:49,710 --> 01:52:51,110
This,
there's a humanness and,

1753
01:52:51,111 --> 01:52:55,340
and alive in this and intelligence and a
lot of it's what we are and we all have

1754
01:52:55,341 --> 01:52:59,480
our particular qualities, but you
know, there's this basic goodness.

1755
01:52:59,481 --> 01:53:04,481
So a lot of what I'm doing and my books
and then my teachings is how do we pay

1756
01:53:07,761 --> 01:53:12,410
attention so we can come to trust that
and live from that and then look at each

1757
01:53:12,411 --> 01:53:13,430
other like,

1758
01:53:13,431 --> 01:53:18,431
so I can be listening to you and
sense pass any mask or persona,

1759
01:53:18,830 --> 01:53:23,180
just that, um, you know, just
that consciousness, the sentience,

1760
01:53:23,210 --> 01:53:25,250
the place that we're
really in the same field.

1761
01:53:28,150 --> 01:53:31,480
So many questions I could ask,
but I know we're,

1762
01:53:31,550 --> 01:53:35,800
we're probably coming up on time and
I don't want to consume your entire

1763
01:53:35,801 --> 01:53:40,330
afternoon, but I do have a few
more I'd love to ask. And, uh,

1764
01:53:40,450 --> 01:53:44,980
the, you're mentioning knowing thyself.
And actually before I get to that,

1765
01:53:44,981 --> 01:53:49,981
just a quick side note for people who do
face a lot of fire in the public world.

1766
01:53:50,730 --> 01:53:55,270
Uh, when I first got exposed
with the success of the
first book and it was turned

1767
01:53:55,271 --> 01:53:58,430
down by whatever it was, 27 publishers,
no one expected to do anything.

1768
01:53:58,431 --> 01:54:03,160
And all of a sudden I was
having to get 10 with a lot of,

1769
01:54:03,470 --> 01:54:07,960
uh, public facing an angst.
And, uh, someone said to me,

1770
01:54:07,961 --> 01:54:10,900
you're never as good as they say you
are and you're never as bad as they say.

1771
01:54:11,700 --> 01:54:15,940
And I was like, wow, that's good advice.
Uh, don't let it go to your head,

1772
01:54:15,941 --> 01:54:19,660
but don't get shopped off at
the knees either. The, the,

1773
01:54:19,800 --> 01:54:24,550
let me ask a couple of questions that
are, are less, maybe less serious than,

1774
01:54:24,820 --> 01:54:26,950
than some of those we've tackled, but, um,

1775
01:54:27,760 --> 01:54:32,530
feel free to answer or not answer or,
uh, however you feel you need to respond.

1776
01:54:32,531 --> 01:54:35,920
But, so the first is, um, what,

1777
01:54:36,580 --> 01:54:40,450
what music would people be surprised
to know you like or listen to?

1778
01:54:46,850 --> 01:54:50,300
I'm not sure if surprised.
I love Mozart and Beethoven.

1779
01:54:50,990 --> 01:54:54,320
Tickle music. Not Thinking that's
going to be surprised. You don't,

1780
01:54:54,340 --> 01:54:57,270
you don't listen to like Marilyn Manson
when you're working out or anything? Oh,

1781
01:54:57,280 --> 01:54:59,230
when I'm working out,
but you didn't ask me that.

1782
01:55:01,960 --> 01:55:04,270
You know, my son widened
my taste, so you know,

1783
01:55:04,380 --> 01:55:08,020
so I can then I have a capacity to enjoy
a whole lot of different art forms.

1784
01:55:08,021 --> 01:55:09,940
But you know,
I don't like a lot of,

1785
01:55:10,030 --> 01:55:14,890
I like silence and quiet so
I'm not, you know, I try to,

1786
01:55:15,370 --> 01:55:17,110
whenever I can have it quieter.

1787
01:55:17,390 --> 01:55:18,430
Got It.
Okay.

1788
01:55:18,890 --> 01:55:23,890
What about a guilty pleasure that is a
movie movie or documentary or TV show

1789
01:55:26,540 --> 01:55:31,540
that you really enjoy that might not
immediately come to mind if people are

1790
01:55:33,951 --> 01:55:38,270
imagining what a, that you
would like. Is there anything,

1791
01:55:38,290 --> 01:55:42,170
are you like a big legal,
a lethal weapon fan or any,

1792
01:55:43,860 --> 01:55:47,310
what was that series? I'm forgetting
it now that I love so much. You know,

1793
01:55:47,530 --> 01:55:52,530
Albuquerque and drugs and
breaking, breaking bad.

1794
01:55:53,040 --> 01:55:55,110
I went crazy for breaking bad.

1795
01:55:55,140 --> 01:55:59,300
I went so crazy for it that I would
be teaching a class and leading the

1796
01:55:59,310 --> 01:56:01,080
meditation and knowing
you didn't want to be,

1797
01:56:01,200 --> 01:56:05,250
I wanted to get home sooner so I could
catch him. You know? I mean, I love that.

1798
01:56:05,430 --> 01:56:08,680
Yeah. So that's one. Does that count?

1799
01:56:09,760 --> 01:56:13,950
Okay. Do you have a favorite documentary
or any favorite documentaries?

1800
01:56:15,130 --> 01:56:19,190
You know, my favorites are more just
because I have such a passion for it. The,

1801
01:56:19,240 --> 01:56:21,760
you know, any of the
documentaries about, um,

1802
01:56:22,480 --> 01:56:26,620
there's been documentaries about the
earth, you know, those kinds of things.

1803
01:56:26,621 --> 01:56:31,270
Documentaries about pharmaceutical
industry document. You know,

1804
01:56:31,271 --> 01:56:34,490
it's kind of the political ones that I,
unbelievers and that,

1805
01:56:34,750 --> 01:56:38,650
that undressed things. The
tobacco industry, you know,

1806
01:56:38,651 --> 01:56:40,780
there's been some
documentaries on racism better.

1807
01:56:41,200 --> 01:56:46,180
Like I just saw one called doing racism
or the illusion of race or something.

1808
01:56:47,080 --> 01:56:49,270
It's just, you know, right now,

1809
01:56:49,271 --> 01:56:53,410
because we're the times you're
bringing it more to our attention.

1810
01:56:53,411 --> 01:56:57,280
It's like we're seeing what's happening
in the daily lives of African Americans,

1811
01:56:57,281 --> 01:57:00,110
but we're just seeing like spot hits of,
you know,

1812
01:57:00,430 --> 01:57:04,750
unarmed African Americans being
killed. And then this whole, you know,

1813
01:57:04,751 --> 01:57:06,370
shooting and Charleston,

1814
01:57:07,150 --> 01:57:10,900
it's like anything that brings
that into our consciousness,

1815
01:57:10,901 --> 01:57:15,640
that this is not some distant other
having a bad experience. Now I man,

1816
01:57:15,641 --> 01:57:19,340
these are our brothers
and sisters part of our,

1817
01:57:19,360 --> 01:57:24,340
our world right here who are living
still on a daily way that is,

1818
01:57:24,610 --> 01:57:28,810
um, violent and oppressive documentaries
that show, that kind of thing.

1819
01:57:30,110 --> 01:57:33,900
Got It. Uh, this is, uh,

1820
01:57:33,950 --> 01:57:38,320
maybe a jarring segue from,
uh,

1821
01:57:39,140 --> 01:57:42,050
and uh, and, uh, be curious to hear
your response to this, but what,

1822
01:57:42,440 --> 01:57:47,420
what purchase of less than a hundred
dollars is most positively impacted your

1823
01:57:47,421 --> 01:57:49,550
life in the last six months or a year?

1824
01:57:50,540 --> 01:57:54,060
Uh, less than a hundred dollars. Um,

1825
01:58:00,290 --> 01:58:01,750
and they have to come back to that one.

1826
01:58:02,160 --> 01:58:05,520
We can come back down or it will be,
or we can table it.

1827
01:58:06,840 --> 01:58:11,270
Oh, we got some raspberry bushes that, uh,

1828
01:58:11,820 --> 01:58:16,290
probably pretty much less. And
they're like, oh my gosh, you know,

1829
01:58:16,291 --> 01:58:19,110
I just went out this morning and
picked a whole mess of raspberries.

1830
01:58:19,111 --> 01:58:21,740
And it's like,
I really like simple pleasures so

1831
01:58:22,580 --> 01:58:26,320
that my gown, well that's the gift that
keeps on giving to it's, yeah, yeah, yeah,

1832
01:58:26,321 --> 01:58:28,690
exactly. Oh, that's, I'm so jealous.

1833
01:58:28,720 --> 01:58:31,750
I wish I could walk out and pick
some raspberries right now. Uh,

1834
01:58:32,470 --> 01:58:36,110
so last, last question,
last of two, but the,

1835
01:58:36,111 --> 01:58:39,460
the t the last question is
kind of a parting question. Uh,

1836
01:58:39,520 --> 01:58:42,130
the advice

1837
01:58:42,130 --> 01:58:44,620
you would give your 30 year old self,

1838
01:58:44,980 --> 01:58:47,020
what advice would you
give your 30 year old self

1839
01:58:51,870 --> 01:58:52,703
to

1840
01:58:54,220 --> 01:58:59,220
profoundly accept and love myself as I am,

1841
01:59:00,160 --> 01:59:02,680
but I'm going to add on to that.
Um,

1842
01:59:03,580 --> 01:59:07,630
and this is more relational as I'd
like to speak to a little bit related,

1843
01:59:07,640 --> 01:59:11,560
you know, we do a lot of training
to be with ourselves in meditation,

1844
01:59:11,980 --> 01:59:16,090
but the missing component is how do we
train ourselves to be with each other.

1845
01:59:16,990 --> 01:59:19,710
And I would say to my 30 year old shelf,

1846
01:59:20,050 --> 01:59:23,050
take the chance of being
more vulnerable. Like, let,

1847
01:59:23,710 --> 01:59:28,710
let your vulnerability be there so that
instead of feeling angry and expressing

1848
01:59:29,590 --> 01:59:30,520
the anger,

1849
01:59:30,760 --> 01:59:35,110
stay with the anger and that she could
feel the vulnerability underneath it and

1850
01:59:35,111 --> 01:59:39,490
be able to name that. And this is
particularly in intimate relationships.

1851
01:59:39,491 --> 01:59:44,420
Like with my husband, we have a
ritual I and we buy a reteach. Uh,

1852
01:59:44,980 --> 01:59:49,860
we teach courses and bringing mindfulness
and meditation to relationships.

1853
01:59:50,360 --> 01:59:55,150
Um, which is one of my favorite things in
the world to be teaching. And uh, that's,

1854
01:59:55,240 --> 01:59:59,230
that's the message it's like
to be, have the, the nerve,

1855
01:59:59,240 --> 02:00:03,670
the courage to feel,
feel what's vulnerable.

1856
02:00:03,850 --> 02:00:04,570
You know,
that,

1857
02:00:04,570 --> 02:00:08,530
that thing I said before about what are
you unwilling to feel to feel it and to

1858
02:00:08,531 --> 02:00:11,320
be able to name it in the seal,
the relationship.

1859
02:00:11,321 --> 02:00:15,160
Because what happened just the way when
you name something inside yourself,

1860
02:00:15,161 --> 02:00:18,530
you're less identified when
you do it together. It,

1861
02:00:18,700 --> 02:00:23,700
it helps both discover a field of intimacy
that really is filled with compassion

1862
02:00:25,240 --> 02:00:30,240
and understanding that you can't get to
if you're not willing to be vulnerable.

1863
02:00:31,170 --> 02:00:33,030
And what is the ritual that
you have with your husband?

1864
02:00:33,730 --> 02:00:37,060
Well, we a couple of times a week and
we do this more than appliques formally,

1865
02:00:37,061 --> 02:00:41,980
like we have to like, it's on our
schedule, um, is, um, which is,

1866
02:00:41,981 --> 02:00:44,710
you know, Tuesday and
Friday mornings we, um,

1867
02:00:44,980 --> 02:00:49,980
we alter our morning routine some so that
we sit down and meditate together and

1868
02:00:50,981 --> 02:00:55,981
then we basically share
whatever's going on.

1869
02:00:56,400 --> 02:00:57,520
You know,
it could be in our lives,

1870
02:00:57,610 --> 02:01:02,560
but more is there anything
right now between you and
I and really feeling loving

1871
02:01:02,890 --> 02:01:07,210
and feeling open and that's
kind of the inquiry and, um,

1872
02:01:07,780 --> 02:01:11,290
and, and then to hold a space for
whatever's there so that nothing,

1873
02:01:11,320 --> 02:01:14,680
so we don't get into a habit of that,
you know,

1874
02:01:14,800 --> 02:01:18,670
of in some way covering over something
and then having something built and then

1875
02:01:18,671 --> 02:01:23,560
not be as tender and open with each other.
And we're,

1876
02:01:23,561 --> 02:01:25,390
you know, we're, we hadn't
been married that long.

1877
02:01:25,390 --> 02:01:29,620
We've been probably together for
about 12 years. And, um, you know,

1878
02:01:29,621 --> 02:01:31,870
and it keeps on growing and unfolding.

1879
02:01:31,871 --> 02:01:36,430
And I will tell you one very brief story
that, and one of our ritual sessions,

1880
02:01:36,490 --> 02:01:39,140
um,
I had this feeling like he was,

1881
02:01:39,170 --> 02:01:43,610
he was kind of like staying
on the perimeter and so
on. So at one point I said,

1882
02:01:44,060 --> 02:01:46,430
so how are we doing?

1883
02:01:47,420 --> 02:01:51,880
And he had that deer in the headlights
swept like, oh my God, sorry,

1884
02:01:51,890 --> 02:01:56,560
anniversary every guy in the
history of the world. Exactly,

1885
02:01:56,561 --> 02:01:59,200
exactly. To me the other day, she
goes, do you know what tomorrow is?

1886
02:01:59,201 --> 02:02:01,970
And I was like, Oh God, oh no. Yes,

1887
02:02:02,320 --> 02:02:06,420
I know it strikes terror in a man's
heart. I get it, but I get it. And it was,

1888
02:02:06,430 --> 02:02:09,040
and it was actually,
I could even feel it as I was doing,

1889
02:02:09,041 --> 02:02:10,420
it was very controlling move.

1890
02:02:10,750 --> 02:02:15,700
So he had that look and then
pull that into his iPhone.

1891
02:02:15,970 --> 02:02:19,660
And he said, Siri, what do you do
when your wife says, how are we doing?

1892
02:02:20,200 --> 02:02:24,150
And here's what she said. I swear
this is the truth. Very said.

1893
02:02:25,080 --> 02:02:27,790
You say,
I'm okay and you're okay.

1894
02:02:27,791 --> 02:02:30,460
And this is the best
of all possible worlds.

1895
02:02:31,750 --> 02:02:32,583
Really?

1896
02:02:33,030 --> 02:02:36,930
Oh, really? He's like, I
mean, I, he handed it to me,

1897
02:02:36,931 --> 02:02:40,650
I looked at it and I gave up. I said,
okay, let's go kayaking. I said,

1898
02:02:40,651 --> 02:02:43,110
drop this communication stuff.
Let's just go play

1899
02:02:44,290 --> 02:02:47,230
unexpected turn of events.
That's, that's amazing.

1900
02:02:49,710 --> 02:02:50,171
But I liked,

1901
02:02:50,171 --> 02:02:53,320
I really liked the idea of having these
scheduled checkins because it also

1902
02:02:53,321 --> 02:02:58,321
avoids the bubbling over a of these
conversations or discussions so that they

1903
02:03:01,900 --> 02:03:06,520
erupt at really inopportune,
uncomfortable times. Uh, right.

1904
02:03:06,800 --> 02:03:10,120
Minimize the Zippo doesn't eliminate
them, but it, it helps to mitigate that.

1905
02:03:10,760 --> 02:03:14,180
Well, what happens is when
they come at the wrong time,

1906
02:03:14,330 --> 02:03:16,790
we go into our old habitual,

1907
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:21,150
either the sender attack
mode and what we and,

1908
02:03:21,200 --> 02:03:25,460
and then actually create the walls that
are the two we don't want. So it really,

1909
02:03:25,461 --> 02:03:27,920
it really helps just
like formal meditation,

1910
02:03:28,190 --> 02:03:32,180
it helps to have on-purpose sitting times
so that if something needs to present

1911
02:03:32,181 --> 02:03:35,210
itself and you need to work through
something, you're, you're available.

1912
02:03:35,480 --> 02:03:37,370
And then stuff will come
up at other times too.

1913
02:03:37,371 --> 02:03:39,920
But you kind of get more than
knack of how to work with it then.

1914
02:03:41,040 --> 02:03:41,760
I love it.

1915
02:03:41,760 --> 02:03:46,760
And if you could make an ask of
everyone listening to this and ask,

1916
02:03:47,820 --> 02:03:50,340
or a recommendation,
what would that be?

1917
02:03:55,170 --> 02:04:00,170
The real ask would be to pause enough
so that you can contact what's really

1918
02:04:00,741 --> 02:04:05,741
going on inside you and pause enough so
that you can look at another and see the

1919
02:04:06,531 --> 02:04:10,430
goodness that's fair and mirror back some.
Let people know.

1920
02:04:12,370 --> 02:04:15,540
Very good advice. Tara, I love your work.

1921
02:04:15,600 --> 02:04:18,360
I'm so glad you're out there
in the world doing what you do.

1922
02:04:18,960 --> 02:04:23,580
Where can people find you on that?

1923
02:04:23,640 --> 02:04:26,460
That web known as the interweb Internet,

1924
02:04:28,100 --> 02:04:29,280
Tara brock.com.

1925
02:04:30,500 --> 02:04:32,300
Yeah,
that's the simplest way.

1926
02:04:32,330 --> 02:04:35,920
And then get on my email list.
I,

1927
02:04:35,980 --> 02:04:39,990
I'm not a massive emailer. I mean, I keep
being told I should do that. I'm not,

1928
02:04:40,020 --> 02:04:44,370
but I do let, let folks know
then, uh, the different, uh,

1929
02:04:44,430 --> 02:04:47,720
in person and online courses
that I'm doing at the,

1930
02:04:47,800 --> 02:04:51,060
the ones that are coming up or there's
one on fear that's coming up that I'm

1931
02:04:51,061 --> 02:04:53,990
excited about. And Jonathan,
my husband and I are,

1932
02:04:54,050 --> 02:04:56,940
are teaching some relationship workshops.

1933
02:04:57,310 --> 02:04:59,220
So those kinds of things
you'll find out about

1934
02:04:59,940 --> 02:05:01,110
and the guided meditations,

1935
02:05:01,111 --> 02:05:05,040
just to reiterate that on
your site are fantastic.

1936
02:05:05,041 --> 02:05:09,060
I've listened to them while traveling
quite a bit just to take the edge off.

1937
02:05:09,720 --> 02:05:14,310
Uh, so I once again appreciate you
putting that out in the world for free.

1938
02:05:14,790 --> 02:05:19,790
Is there anything else you would
like to say before we close this,

1939
02:05:21,661 --> 02:05:23,220
this chapter?
One conversation?

1940
02:05:24,720 --> 02:05:28,540
Um,
I want to appreciate you because you know,

1941
02:05:28,541 --> 02:05:33,541
I've been talking about evolution and I
feel like you really are your curiosity

1942
02:05:35,650 --> 02:05:38,770
and your way, your way of
interviewing, you know,

1943
02:05:38,771 --> 02:05:43,771
there's one teacher says that attention
is the most pure expression of love and

1944
02:05:45,490 --> 02:05:50,490
your way of interviewing and also moving
to the world is deeply attentive and

1945
02:05:51,610 --> 02:05:55,510
courageous and sets a
model for us. So, um, um,

1946
02:05:55,760 --> 02:05:57,640
it's a pleasure to the whole hands.

1947
02:05:57,940 --> 02:06:02,630
Oh, thank you. Thank you. That makes,
that makes my day. I really appreciate it.

1948
02:06:03,350 --> 02:06:08,350
And hopefully we will get to meet
in person sometime soon and uh,

1949
02:06:09,070 --> 02:06:13,120
we'd love to, to see the
Potomac from the, from the, uh,

1950
02:06:13,450 --> 02:06:16,460
the perspective of where you stand with
your dog. That just sounds amazing.

1951
02:06:16,850 --> 02:06:21,850
So I really appreciate everything that
you do and of course everyone listening,

1952
02:06:22,640 --> 02:06:24,530
I will take the resources,

1953
02:06:24,531 --> 02:06:28,820
links and so on from his conversation
book recommendations, uh,

1954
02:06:28,850 --> 02:06:33,850

others and put them into the show notes so
