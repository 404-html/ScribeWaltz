1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,310
You've done so many different things.
You ended up on Wall Street at one point.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,800
Am I right? Did that happen
right after school? Or

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,930
what happened was I was,

4
00:00:07,931 --> 00:00:12,931
I was so excited that I got
into Cornell that I found out,

5
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,980
and again, I was kind of figuring
this out on the fly, really been,

6
00:00:15,981 --> 00:00:19,990
have parents that were guiding me on
this because they had no experience with

7
00:00:19,991 --> 00:00:21,670
college. Right. And so, um,

8
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:26,140
I found out that there was an MBA program
at Cornell that you could do in one

9
00:00:26,141 --> 00:00:30,190
year so you could finish Undergrad
and Grad and a five year program.

10
00:00:30,191 --> 00:00:32,590
So I figured let's just
press my bets and go for it.

11
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:37,830
And I took a class to get familiar with
the MBA program and entrepreneurship

12
00:00:38,261 --> 00:00:41,410
class and I won.
I won the entrepreneurship award.

13
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:46,650
So during that class I met a bunch of
judges who were very successful people

14
00:00:46,811 --> 00:00:48,580
that had graduated Cornell,
gone on their own.

15
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:51,190
And in one of those judges
took a real liking to me.

16
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,320
I didn't make the MBA program,
they didn't accept me.

17
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:57,340
And I went back to queens to run that
swimming pool and construction business,

18
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,690
which was doing very,

19
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,810
very well at that point because I was
able to apply all the things I was

20
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:05,740
learning at Cornell to
my business. So, so, uh,

21
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,930
so I go back and I'm running
the business and that,

22
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:12,550
that judge stayed in touch with me. Many
calls me literally first of the month,

23
00:01:12,551 --> 00:01:14,520
every month and says, when are you
gonna get out of the pool business?

24
00:01:14,521 --> 00:01:17,410
You got to go to New York City.
And I was in queens and I said,

25
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:21,820
I'm doing really well. I met this
great girl, you know, I'm 22 years old.

26
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,520
I don't need to go to
Manhattan. And uh, he,

27
00:01:24,521 --> 00:01:27,880
every month he drove me
crazy and one day he says,

28
00:01:27,881 --> 00:01:30,190
I'm all right if you're not
going to listen to me. And now,

29
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,800
now I'm probably two years out of Cornell.

30
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,570
And he see that he's losing the battle.
And he says,

31
00:01:35,571 --> 00:01:37,300
if you're not going to listen to,
I want you to buy this stock.

32
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,060
And I had never bought a stock before.
And um,

33
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:43,930
he tells me about a stock is in Texas.
There's a drug company now,

34
00:01:43,931 --> 00:01:47,350
this is an older guy that that's been
trading and managing money for years.

35
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:50,980
And He'd been watching the
stock for 25 years and he says,

36
00:01:50,981 --> 00:01:54,370
I want you to buy this stock. It's $14
a share. It's a, it's a drug company.

37
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:57,170
And he's an old time cape reader.
And I'm thinking, I don't want to,

38
00:01:57,171 --> 00:01:59,590
I've been working so hard, I'm not
going to invest in a stock. I mean,

39
00:01:59,591 --> 00:02:02,200
I remember the 87 crash.
I'm like, this guy is crazy.

40
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:06,700
And I go to one of my customer's House
that day that owed me quite a bit of

41
00:02:06,701 --> 00:02:09,070
money for finishing a big
construction job he owed me.
