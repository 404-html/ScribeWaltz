1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,370
Do you think? I'm sorry. I'm
just thinking, uh, interview,
um, on the, uh, old Skype.

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:06,810
Any chance you could not move them?

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,920
I can run flat out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking.

4
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:21,240
I'm a cybernetic organism
living this year.

5
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:30,720
Thank you.
For sure.

This episode is a conversation between
yours truly Tim Ferris and Ed Cooke.

21
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:32,760
Ed Cook is a grand master
of memory based in Britain.

22
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,920
Great Britain,
a good friend.

23
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:38,310
He's made a number of appearances
in the four hour chef.

24
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:43,610
He helped improve my ability to memorize
anything and everything is also very

25
00:01:43,951 --> 00:01:45,390
well known for coaching.

26
00:01:45,391 --> 00:01:50,391
A writer named Joshua four from nothing
I he ground zero to becoming u s

27
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,370
national memory champion and I
believe a year or so of time,

28
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:00,450
a really astonishing feat and we'll get
into what grand master of memory means.

29
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,830
This is a two part episode,
so you have two separate parts.

30
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,040
They are very, very
dense. They're hilarious.

31
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:10,680
If you liked the Kevin Kelly episodes,

32
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:15,620
the Josh Waitzkin episodes or any
episodes that are similar to those very in

33
00:02:15,621 --> 00:02:19,920
depth wide ranging, you are going to
love this episode. I hope you enjoy it.

34
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,170
So without further ado,
here's I'd cook.

35
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:25,950
Hello Ladies and gentlemen,

36
00:02:25,951 --> 00:02:30,210
this is Tim Ferriss and welcome to a
special episode of the Tim Ferriss show.

37
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:33,870
I have my dear friend Ed Cook on the line.

38
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,900
I grabbed him last minute for reasons I
shall explain and he is a grand master

39
00:02:39,511 --> 00:02:41,790
of memory among many,
many other things at the,

40
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,230
at the ripe old age of 23 is when
he turned that corner. But Ed,

41
00:02:46,231 --> 00:02:48,300
where are you at the moment and,

42
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:51,280
and what are you up to summer?

43
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:56,130
I'm currently sitting in the,
uh, in the office where I work,

44
00:02:56,131 --> 00:02:59,980
which is a converted method is chapel
in Bethnal Green London. Um, and it's

45
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,320
Friday night at 10:15 PM yes.
Well,

46
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:07,180
people with adequate social lives.
A, I kind of be a, you know,

47
00:03:07,181 --> 00:03:10,220
running around town and
falling in love. Um, yeah, I'm,

48
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,400
I'm here and I'm trying to youtube
and I'm delighted to be here.

49
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,800
I wanted to actually share with people
what we just talked about doing an audio

50
00:03:19,531 --> 00:03:23,940
check before we began recording where
you gave the best answer I've ever heard,

51
00:03:23,941 --> 00:03:26,610
to a very mundane question,

52
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,950
which is what did you tell me
what you had for breakfast?

53
00:03:28,951 --> 00:03:32,550
Or what did you have for breakfast?
And you can feel free to improvise,

54
00:03:32,551 --> 00:03:34,110
but what was your answer roughly?

55
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:38,880
Well, it was a sound check.
So it, I myself of a sudden
embellishment. But yeah,

56
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:43,770
that was just what I think had a
couple of 'em partridges um, um,

57
00:03:43,771 --> 00:03:48,490
a few sausages, some salmon, seven
campground kippers I think they were,

58
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:52,780
they were the campus and
the peat smoke kippers uh,

59
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:57,640
full boiled eggs and two poached eggs,
that kind of thing. Yeah, I caught her.

60
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:02,230
I actually don't know the English king,
but, um, I had a friend who, um, uh,

61
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:04,460
it was amazing. Fred
said a friend who, uh,

62
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:08,520
occasionally breakfasty to sorta chuck a
lot of counter be. I mean, I'd be like,

63
00:04:08,521 --> 00:04:10,320
you know, what are you talking
about? And He'd be like, oh,

64
00:04:10,321 --> 00:04:11,670
I'm just thinking about what,
you know,

65
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,040
Henry the sixth had for
breakfast every day.

66
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,250
I should,

67
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:23,000
I know I shouldn't give some background
for folks who may not realize that, uh,

68
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:28,030
you and I first connected several years
ago and you were tremendously helpful

69
00:04:28,251 --> 00:04:33,050
with the four hour chef since that
was a book about accelerated learning

70
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:36,470
disguised as a cookbook, which
surprise surprise ended up being very,

71
00:04:36,471 --> 00:04:39,560
very confusing to almost everybody
in the universe who came across it.

72
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:43,970
But there were aspects of it including,
uh,

73
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:49,030
chapters focused on pneumonic devices and
other types of memory techniques where

74
00:04:50,721 --> 00:04:54,920
you were incredibly helpful. So first of
all, thank you very much for that. Um,

75
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,040
or my perfect and I was having trouble
piecing together how we first came in

76
00:05:00,861 --> 00:05:03,380
contact.
How did we first meet?

77
00:05:03,381 --> 00:05:07,850
And I should also just as context for
folks point out that Ed is in the UK,

78
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:10,460
I am drinking highly caffeinated tea.

79
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:14,930
He is drinking wine and this is
intended to be like a pub conversation.

80
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:19,640
So
please feel to the interpretation

81
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:23,320
did it already robots? So the context
of a, of a ripe old age just pub. Yeah.

82
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,690
Well we came into contact through,
um,

83
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:31,190
my dear friend Greg with whom
I co founded the company. Um,

84
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,450
and um,

85
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:36,720
Greg was then a phd student at Princeton
and I think you came to do a couple of

86
00:05:36,721 --> 00:05:40,160
tools. He got shy with you and
it was through that, that we met.

87
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:44,060
That's right. And so, uh, for
those who are not familiar, uh,

88
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,730
ed is cofounder and the office
that he referred to is related to,

89
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:53,260
uh, his company memorize, memorize
Dotcom, which we'll come back to. And,

90
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:58,220
uh, the, the concept of being
a grand master of memories,

91
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,900
I were like concept that qualification,

92
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:03,680
what is entailed in becoming
a grandmaster of memory.

93
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:08,280
So, um, yeah, so, so I think I'll,

94
00:06:08,281 --> 00:06:10,850
I'll explain that first and then
we can discuss it a little bit. Um,

95
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:16,190
just how stupid a term it is and
what a marvelous device for kind of,

96
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:20,630
you know, either ending a conversational
beginning one at a bus stop. But yeah.

97
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:23,810
So I'm at Grandma's to remind me, it's
a kind of title given out by the, uh,

98
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:25,550
the world memory sports,
but they should and,

99
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,890
and basically you have
to be able to remember,

100
00:06:27,891 --> 00:06:32,630
I'm a 100 digit number in and out a pack
of cards in under a couple of minutes

101
00:06:32,631 --> 00:06:37,610
and then 10 packs of shuffle
the cards in an hour. So it's,

102
00:06:37,611 --> 00:06:42,350
um, so it's, it's three
parts of the world, maybe
championships, which determine,

103
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:47,600
uh, whether you can get this title
and um, yeah, I mean it's, um,

104
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,940
it's a great title.
I mean,

105
00:06:49,941 --> 00:06:54,941
I can't really very compelling title
and I decide either the number of times,

106
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:58,740
you know, I've been in the kind of
losing situation and like club, you know,

107
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:03,300
outdanced um, you know, you know,
I'm not a symmetrical person, Tim.

108
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:07,940
Um, and, uh, you know, sometimes my
visual, you're kind of understates the,

109
00:07:07,941 --> 00:07:12,110
the value of conversation with me. So
this is sort of like, and, but he's just,

110
00:07:12,111 --> 00:07:14,830
you know, just, so I said,
what's your problem? It's
like, sorry, I'm [inaudible].

111
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:16,890
It's like, okay, you know,

112
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,280
device from champagne and then
we can talk further about this.

113
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:24,320
That's important qualification. But
yeah, it's, it's a very city concept.

114
00:07:24,321 --> 00:07:26,310
But, um, the, you know, the, the,

115
00:07:26,311 --> 00:07:31,220
the kind of the cultural context if you
want from which emerges namely people

116
00:07:31,221 --> 00:07:35,930
doing competitive memory competitions I
think is awesome and fascinating because,

117
00:07:35,931 --> 00:07:39,170
um, uh, because um,

118
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,450
in 1990,

119
00:07:41,451 --> 00:07:46,340
the world record for memorizing a
shuffled deck of cards was 149 seconds,

120
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:50,660
which know if he could memorize a pack
of cards in under three minutes and show

121
00:07:50,661 --> 00:07:54,050
that to somebody, they'd be fatty,
astounded. And we think you were teaching.

122
00:07:54,051 --> 00:07:54,760
And you know,

123
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:59,340
it's not obvious to anybody that the
human mind would be capable of that. Um,

124
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,970
and I remember I was
very proud, um, you know,

125
00:08:01,971 --> 00:08:06,590
10 years ago when I first broke a
minute, I asked like, oh my goodness,

126
00:08:06,591 --> 00:08:07,670
this is extraordinary.
I mean,

127
00:08:07,671 --> 00:08:12,380
the word record now is 21 seconds for
the memorization of a shuffled deck of 52

128
00:08:12,381 --> 00:08:14,840
cards. You sort of think,
well, obviously, you know,

129
00:08:14,841 --> 00:08:19,190
people presumably haven't got like
four times faster brains and they did.

130
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:24,010
Um, I'm only 24 years ago.
But the reason for it is,

131
00:08:24,011 --> 00:08:28,720
is that there's been this
competitive culture in which, um,

132
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:32,480
there's an objective measure
of mnemonic speed if you like.

133
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,360
And over the last 10,
over the last 20 years,

134
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:40,760
people have on each year done their
best to outgun the rivals and the memory

135
00:08:40,761 --> 00:08:45,350
scene and then very openly and freely
shared the techniques and hacks they've

136
00:08:45,351 --> 00:08:50,351
used to be able to optimize these
30 arbitrary but nonetheless kind of

137
00:08:50,601 --> 00:08:52,170
interesting processes of,
you know,

138
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:57,190
memorization and the results has been
an absolutely continuous linear increase

139
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:02,490
in the amount of stuff that people can
remember across of very wide range of

140
00:09:02,491 --> 00:09:05,520
disciplines in a
particular amount of time.

141
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:09,960
So this is true or like names and faces,
random strings of words,

142
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,050
crazy like abstract, he
generated images, all this stuff.

143
00:09:13,051 --> 00:09:16,920
People who have been able to think up to
test people's memories with as a result

144
00:09:16,921 --> 00:09:21,300
of this community of
competition and sharing. Um,

145
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:21,991
you know,

146
00:09:21,991 --> 00:09:26,991
people have got almost 10 times faster
now in the course of 24 years at

147
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:29,850
memorizing things when it was already
very impressive in the first place. So,

148
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:30,870
yeah,

149
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,100
I think that's why it's an
interesting thing. Yeah.

150
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:37,630
Is that a function of prize money,
Prestige,

151
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:43,140
social media? I'm very curious about the
dynamic that has produced that progress.

152
00:09:43,141 --> 00:09:46,440
Because if you look at mixed
martial arts for instance,

153
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:50,070
UFC and you look at the first 10 of C's,

154
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:54,810
compare that to compare to the
competitors, to the competitors,

155
00:09:54,811 --> 00:09:57,840
say a 30 UFC fcs later.

156
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:02,930
Compare those competitors with those of
today as the prize money has increased.

157
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:06,290
Among other things, I think it's
primarily the prize money. Uh,

158
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:11,300
you see a very quick evolution in terms
of whether it's selection bias or just a

159
00:10:12,451 --> 00:10:15,930
larger pool of competitors
that has gone from say,

160
00:10:15,931 --> 00:10:20,931
top 20% of athletes in the United
States to top 10 to top two.

161
00:10:21,451 --> 00:10:26,040
And you're just looking at at mutants
in many cases now, uh, not to,

162
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,210
not to detract from their tech team,

163
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:33,210
not to diminish your amount is applicable.

164
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,970
Yeah. Right. Not to, not to diminish
their, their gentlemen laid demeanor, uh,

165
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,650
and technique and training.
But is what is, what is,

166
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:44,550
what are the contributing
factors to the, the, the,

167
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:48,030
the increases in,
in speed.

168
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,150
And came in, well, it over the
options. You have it up the um,

169
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:56,990
you can choose, you can
choose other ones. Yeah.

170
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:02,190
Well total Twitter followers
of a competitors of the
warm every term ships is,

171
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,670
uh, yeah, 20, 25 or
something. But, um, yeah, the,

172
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:11,740
um, and it's not money. There's no,
there's no real money on it. I think it's,

173
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:16,300
um, you know, I would just, I
would her suppose that, you know,

174
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:18,940
perhaps in a hundred years' time
if people, we did still care,

175
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:24,520
the current state of memory sports would
be considered still extraordinarily

176
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:28,060
immature. Um, and so I think we'll
probably, what of, what's the kind of,

177
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,150
it's like cricket in the 19th century
in England where people were kind of

178
00:11:31,151 --> 00:11:35,110
working out the basics
of technique. Um, um,

179
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,580
in that case, historically, I believe
it was the invention of the steam train,

180
00:11:39,581 --> 00:11:42,220
which allowed cricket.
They get good because, uh,

181
00:11:42,221 --> 00:11:46,660
teams from further apart in the country
could visit each other. Um, the,

182
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,340
uh, information and press
was delivered quicker.

183
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:54,820
And so there was a sort of general,
um, increased in the talent pool.

184
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,620
We're competing with each other. And, uh,

185
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:00,100
and it was just possible to
even travel and sort of compete.

186
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:02,560
And it's something that said, like,
people from all over the world can do it,

187
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:06,620
you know, it's easy to hop on a plane so
that that's a contributing factor. Um,

188
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,370
but I think fundamentally
the motivation is there.

189
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:14,890
There's just so cool winning or doing
well in the world memory championships,

190
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:18,330
then it's purely a, it's
purely a kind of, um,

191
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,410
slightly comic form of status I think,

192
00:12:20,411 --> 00:12:23,380
which drives it as well as
the fact that of course it's,

193
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:27,120
it's phenomenally interesting to,
um,

194
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:31,060
take something which every single person
there would never imagine they were

195
00:12:31,061 --> 00:12:34,900
capable of doing and push it
and push it and push it to,

196
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:37,420
to see how well it can be done.
Um,

197
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:42,730
and it probably helps that it's quite
precisely quantifiable and he was like a

198
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:46,920
hundred meters or whatever else. And
I wanted to, I wanted to grab, uh,

199
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:51,280
something you mentioned and
come back to which is what, what

200
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:55,640
the average person is capable of doing
or what most people are capable of doing.

201
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,050
And,
uh,

202
00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:01,330
perhaps you could recount for folks the
outcome of one of the experiments that,

203
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:04,880
that you and I did a
also involving your team,

204
00:13:04,881 --> 00:13:06,410
which was related to the four hour chef.

205
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:11,300
So we wanted to incentivize people to
try to memorize a shuffled deck of cards.

206
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:15,380
And I was hoping you could talk a little
bit about that and the outcome because

207
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,650
a lot of people listening will
probably assume like a thousand digits.

208
00:13:18,651 --> 00:13:22,370
I could never even remember a phone
number. I couldn't remember 20 numbers.

209
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,830
And they underestimate what
they're capable of doing.

210
00:13:24,831 --> 00:13:29,600
So I would love if you could just perhaps
recount the results of the experiment

211
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:31,100
that we did related to the book launch.

212
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:36,440
Yes. That was, that was a fun, fun thing
we did. So, yeah. Or memorize we, um,

213
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:40,320
we don't just competition,
uh, with you, Tim. Uh, yeah.

214
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,270
At the same time as the launch
of the book. Um, and you know,

215
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,640
it was a $10,000 prize.
Um,

216
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:49,580
I believe munificent be supplied
by Youtube. Yup. That's right.

217
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:55,430
I spent it on a, yeah. Anyway,
so, um, so anyhow, so yeah.

218
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,070
So did I had this,
um,

219
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,950
this great engineer and the office called
tank who built this amazing system,

220
00:14:00,951 --> 00:14:05,510
which was basically, um, a standard
memorize course where you would,

221
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:09,620
um, learned to associate with
each card in the deck. Um,

222
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:13,970
a person. And I'd actually
proposed like a group of 52 people,

223
00:14:13,971 --> 00:14:17,720
but there are ways of changing
them to be people, uh, that you,

224
00:14:17,721 --> 00:14:19,940
you wanted to have in your,
in your set of images.

225
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:22,850
And the basic technique underlying
this is the, um, you know,

226
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:26,120
cards are boring and a memorable
sequences are boring, are memorable.

227
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,230
How do you remember them?
Well,

228
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:31,310
you turn the cards into images
which are more memorable.

229
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,200
And so for instance,
Tim,

230
00:14:33,201 --> 00:14:36,950
you are slightly more memorable
than the three of hearts say, um,

231
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:39,860
because you have characteristics,
you have a personality.

232
00:14:39,861 --> 00:14:43,250
I can imagine you in detail,
like I made new interacting in situations,

233
00:14:43,251 --> 00:14:48,251
so you're inherently more interesting
to my brain than mere card or figure or,

234
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,860
um, or, or anything like that. Um, and so

235
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:56,030
mean this is going to be and
couldn't be and here an expedition,

236
00:14:56,031 --> 00:15:00,830
but I'll keep going. So, um, I think it's,
I think you do think you're doing great.

237
00:15:00,831 --> 00:15:02,930
The assumption that I have
personality is a bit of a stretch,

238
00:15:02,931 --> 00:15:04,100
but besides that you're doing fine.

239
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:09,750
I didn't say that it was an adequate to
I one. I just said there was one. Um,

240
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:13,070
anyway, so, um, so you know,

241
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:17,300
the basics of memory techniques is that
our minds love certain kinds of things.

242
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,820
So we're very,
very good at remembering spaces were very,

243
00:15:19,821 --> 00:15:24,260
very good at remembering things, which,
which attracts our interest. And so,

244
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:26,830
you know,
a good of thumb I like to use is that,

245
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,690
and I think we should grab your attention
if you're wondering down the streets

246
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:34,410
is the kind of thing which will grab your
attention and your memory. So you know,

247
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:38,120
we'll something grey and um,
written in legal language.

248
00:15:38,121 --> 00:15:40,700
Grab your attention if you
are walking on the street. No,

249
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:44,410
but we'll like kind of a small
elephant being attacked by Lemars.

250
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:46,370
I try to attention, yes, you will.

251
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:50,420
A spectacular lists of naked woman.
I tried to attention,

252
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,620
perhaps we'll um, a um, Balart do.

253
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:55,700
So probably not.

254
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:59,060
And so it's the same thing when we
kind of perceive within ourselves,

255
00:15:59,061 --> 00:16:02,240
which is to say when we remember the,
the vivid,

256
00:16:02,241 --> 00:16:06,650
interesting emotion grabbing
things. I again, Tim,

257
00:16:06,651 --> 00:16:11,170
I'd like to clarify the evoke
vivid emotions particularly,

258
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:15,980
I mean I'd just take it as
yourself, but anyway, these things,

259
00:16:15,981 --> 00:16:16,820
this is covering attention.

260
00:16:16,821 --> 00:16:19,980
So the art of memory is basically
transforming information which is not

261
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,450
interesting into forms of
information which are interesting.

262
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:27,270
And four pack of cards. The
technique which I, um, I use myself,

263
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:29,990
um, and it's very popular
in the Miami community,

264
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:34,850
is to take each card and then
wrote, associate a person
with it. And, and you know,

265
00:16:34,851 --> 00:16:36,700
if you go with personal association
could do this very quickly.

266
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:41,240
It takes like an afternoon for normal
person to associate with 52 cards,

267
00:16:41,241 --> 00:16:43,640
52 people.
And then having got that code,

268
00:16:43,641 --> 00:16:45,890
which is a bit like a language really
though you think of as language.

269
00:16:45,891 --> 00:16:49,220
So if I say all our to
you, you'll say, oh, hi Ed.

270
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:53,600
And you've just learned that arbitrary
association between some letters or La

271
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:58,760
and a meaning. Know Hi there.
Something. Uh, and it's just
like that with the cards.

272
00:16:58,761 --> 00:17:02,480
It's like a, it's like a very,
very small language, 52 words.

273
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:05,420
And so when you go through
the cards, you, I'm,

274
00:17:05,421 --> 00:17:09,470
you imagine the people you've associated
with the cards instead of the cards.

275
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:11,870
And already it's massively
more interesting.

276
00:17:11,871 --> 00:17:14,390
And the second thing you
do to tackle the sequence,

277
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,970
which is difficult to remember
because it's just a bland sequence,

278
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:21,380
is that you string these people who were
standing in the cards into an amusing

279
00:17:21,381 --> 00:17:24,740
stories. So you, uh, you might be
getting your doorstep and you know,

280
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:29,720
there's Tim Ferriss and he's, he's
desperately trying to impress the queen.

281
00:17:29,721 --> 00:17:30,740
She's not impressed.

282
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:34,130
And then slightly down the road we've
got like the pope and he's chatting with

283
00:17:34,131 --> 00:17:37,910
Ed stone and, and, and you know, these,
these people are standing in for cards.

284
00:17:37,911 --> 00:17:42,080
And because Tim is trying to impress
the queen, it's kind of funny, you know,

285
00:17:42,081 --> 00:17:47,030
kind of a kind of colonial,
perverse humor vibe or whatever.

286
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:49,650
And it's just more interesting than three
of hearts, seven of spades, kinda think.

287
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:53,730
Anyhow, so that's the best city. So,
going back to your original question, we,

288
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,090
we put together a course on memos which
helped people make these associations is

289
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:57,511
that,
you know,

290
00:17:57,511 --> 00:18:01,140
people will play on that for an hour and
they build up this vocabulary of waste

291
00:18:01,141 --> 00:18:04,710
thinking about cards. So they're just
more interesting, more vivid, uh,

292
00:18:04,711 --> 00:18:05,171
that sort of,

293
00:18:05,171 --> 00:18:08,970
they attract more emotion and so they're
just generally more memorable. And then,

294
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:09,810
um,

295
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:14,070
we propose the technique very famous
and the memory kind of community,

296
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:18,120
which is just sort of imagine going
around a space and actually for your blog,

297
00:18:18,121 --> 00:18:18,301
Tim,

298
00:18:18,301 --> 00:18:23,040
I remember embarrassing myself when my
local street in a snow storm trying to

299
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:27,060
wonder around demonstrating how to
place images in space. I was like,

300
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:32,220
oh look up there. There's some of that.
I remember that very closely. They,

301
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:35,220
the search for it, good cook, Cook,

302
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:39,230
Cook with the knee on the
blog to find that video. Yeah.

303
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:42,540
Anyhow, so, um, so we
did the competition. Um,

304
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:46,440
so people learn the technique and they
could practice with this cool system on

305
00:18:46,441 --> 00:18:51,330
the, on the website. And, um,
what was astonishing was that,

306
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:55,140
you know, a few thousand people
entered, you know, most people, um,

307
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:58,770
like basically couldn't be bothered
and give up quite quickly, but, but,

308
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:02,670
but basically anyone who did persevere
and actually just learn the images and

309
00:19:02,671 --> 00:19:06,630
then start practicing. Um,
many of them got really good,

310
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:11,380
really fast. And, um, the girl
who ended up winning it, um,

311
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:16,380
who, whose name is Irina Ziad, she's
a fabulous young lady programmer who,

312
00:19:16,381 --> 00:19:20,010
um, who lives in the Ukraine. I tried
to recruit her for memos, actually.

313
00:19:20,011 --> 00:19:24,900
She was sort of only dimly
interested. Anyway. She, um, she,

314
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:28,470
um,
did it in about four days,

315
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:32,620
so it's just like sat on a computer,
a practice of thing,

316
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
and then within four days. So basically
now that I could do it under a second,

317
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,400
and then the memo is Christmas party.

318
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:44,280
That year we poked her in live on Skype
to prove that she could actually do it

319
00:19:44,281 --> 00:19:48,240
and wasn't cheating as opposed to you,
about 200 people crowding into the church,

320
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:53,100
you know, scenes of unbelievable
at the butchery. Tim, uh, I, uh, I,

321
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:58,100
I think his eyes wide
shut. One of the, yeah,

322
00:19:58,101 --> 00:20:02,970
it was that, but we better chat,
better lighting. Uh, Eddie,

323
00:20:02,971 --> 00:20:06,510
how, um, yeah, it's just, you just
nailed it again, live on Skype. Um,

324
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,560
under the pressure.
We,

325
00:20:07,561 --> 00:20:11,580
we told her I think that that was how
she could actually win the POWs and um,

326
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,530
and that's kind of it. Just a nice
example, you know, like it's, um,

327
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:16,980
it is very doable. And, um, I had,

328
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,240
I had a kind of another interesting
experience with, um, where I met a, I,

329
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:23,460
I went to the u s maybe championships
I think in 2005 with, um,

330
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:27,870
with my friend say this has
been a sort of diversion,

331
00:20:27,871 --> 00:20:28,704
but I'll tell the other day.

332
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:33,690
So I got this friend called Lucas who's
from Austria, from Vienna who is, um,

333
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:38,130
a, an absolutely hilarious
and wonderful fellow who, um,

334
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,000
before we'd done this,
uh,

335
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,830
we've been contacted by channel
four and they were like,

336
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:46,010
we're just interested to hear how
her memory athletes train. And, um,

337
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:47,980
I always been a bit

338
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,100
suspicious to be honest. So the concept
of sort of self hacking, you know,

339
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:54,220
never be quite quite clear whether that's
something I really want to do my life

340
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,960
anyway, so I, so I said, well, you know,

341
00:20:55,961 --> 00:20:59,980
like we like to get to high altitude
and I'm going to complete seclusion.

342
00:20:59,981 --> 00:21:03,370
And I was kind of channeling an image
of Ricky Hatton, the boxer, you know,

343
00:21:03,371 --> 00:21:06,850
going into the mountains
and sort of getting through
some there. They were like,

344
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,310
awesome. So anyway, Lucas and I, we
headed up into the mountains or we, um,

345
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,660
we put on as a source of comedy show
and this can be found on youtube, but a,

346
00:21:16,661 --> 00:21:21,190
um, a kind of image of what a mental
athletes training program would look like.

347
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:25,500
Well, it's a sort of press ups
involving claps and I'm competitive.

348
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:30,220
I'm boxing style mutual recitation
and binary numbers and stuff. Anyhow,

349
00:21:30,221 --> 00:21:33,380
so, um, it's, it's, it's a kind
of, it's a minor. So there,

350
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:37,300
for the sort of 12 or 13 people who,
um,

351
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,480
in your, in your listenership who, um,

352
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,870
who think that I'm actually

353
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:48,970
going to it, I get into an anecdote
within 90 days I would look at it. Okay,

354
00:21:48,971 --> 00:21:49,381
so sorry.

355
00:21:49,381 --> 00:21:53,470
We went to America and we went to the
u s memory chose ships and it was,

356
00:21:53,471 --> 00:21:58,180
it was quite hilarious. So, so both of us
at that point, none American competitors,

357
00:21:58,181 --> 00:22:02,170
we're not really allowed to
compete, but we were allowed
to, can be. And um, anyway,

358
00:22:02,171 --> 00:22:06,250
we came first and second by a margin of
about times three because at that point

359
00:22:06,251 --> 00:22:10,420
the sport was not very well
developed in the u s and M. Anyway,

360
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:14,170
there's a journalist then he was like, oh
my God, you're a geek. You're a a seven.

361
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:16,450
And the rest of it. And I was
like, uh, no, me, you know,

362
00:22:16,451 --> 00:22:20,230
we were two young lads who've got
an enthusiasm for maybe attendance.

363
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:24,000
And so he was like, well,
there, but this is impossible.
So I was like, no, no, no, no,

364
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,420
I'll train you. So, uh,

365
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:29,890
so I trained him for a year and he
wound up the next year. And by the way,

366
00:22:29,891 --> 00:22:32,920
I'm a pretty brutal coach.
It's a kind of a way of, um,

367
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:38,140
is a way for me to transcend my own
insufficiencies is to criticize others.

368
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,470
And so, so I trained him
up for a year and a, yeah,

369
00:22:41,471 --> 00:22:46,240
he wound up winning the American
memory championships. Um, and um,

370
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:48,940
yeah, it, it was pretty cool.
And he wrote a book about it. Um,

371
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,820
that was Joe Garcia for

372
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:56,420
correct. Yeah. Let's just share
for his, um, yeah, he's super cool.

373
00:22:56,570 --> 00:23:00,530
Moonwalking with Einstein. Yeah,
very, very, a book did very,

374
00:23:00,531 --> 00:23:04,340
very well and had a great piece in wired
that introduced me to that, uh, as well.

375
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:09,740
Um, but, uh, sorry to
interrupt, not my, uh,

376
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:10,943
not mine.

377
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:19,730
Perfect. Perfect. Well,
I was, I was, I was, uh,

378
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:24,560
I was taken aback by your sudden
silence, which I mistook for, for,

379
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:28,010
uh, shy shyness, but I
think it's just drunkenness

380
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:31,040
taking another slug.

381
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:37,350
Nice. Nice. Nice to get you a camera
for our next podcast. The, the, uh,

382
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:42,470
so just to put in, just to put things
in perspective for folks with a,

383
00:23:42,471 --> 00:23:47,120
it was arena, right? The
Ukrainian woman. Um, yeah. So she,

384
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:52,900
she learned to memorize a sh a shuffled
or randomized deck of cards and less

385
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:58,010
than a minute in four or five days.
Uh,

386
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:01,850
and the previous us record,

387
00:24:01,851 --> 00:24:04,170
I guess a few years ago had been what,

388
00:24:04,171 --> 00:24:07,200
147 seconds or something
along those lines. Um,

389
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:13,250
so she beat the US record with
four to five days of training.

390
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:14,870
I mean,
granted it was an older record,

391
00:24:14,871 --> 00:24:19,160
but I think that that just highlights
what is possible for people.

392
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:22,730
And, uh, the, the,

393
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:27,530
the question I'd love to ask you is,
I mean, what, what are some, some, uh,

394
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:31,460
some perhaps if people
have an afternoon and, uh,

395
00:24:31,461 --> 00:24:36,461
they are not going to necessarily
focus on the pack of cards.

396
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:40,400
Is there something else that they can
do to prove to themselves that they have

397
00:24:40,401 --> 00:24:41,700
greater,
uh,

398
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:46,790
mental athleticism or
memorization potential than
they've ever thought possible?

399
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:48,230
Is there something else that they can do?

400
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:53,350
They can make love to a beautiful woman
in their imaginations without moving a

401
00:24:53,351 --> 00:24:54,184
muscle.

402
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:56,970
Okay.
And why would you recommend that?

403
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:58,440
Okay.

404
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,810
Um, well, it was a joke.

405
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:07,720
Okay, you got to, you're so dry.
It's just dry. British humor are,

406
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:08,750
we're still dragging her.

407
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,900
That was like, she just, that was a
straight straight out, oh that funny.

408
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:16,820
But I suppose the tinkle of a thought
which underlies every joke there,

409
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:20,390
but take it with a thought. We started
as a joke though. He's just, the

410
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,790
imagination is,
um,

411
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:30,850
an our capacity to form images just
while talking just what communicating is,

412
00:25:31,221 --> 00:25:35,330
um, is already extraordinarily
potent. And it is,

413
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,870
wait, wait, wait. So what will
the thing which confuses people,

414
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:43,100
it's like how can you possibly
like form an image in a second,

415
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:48,380
which you then end up remembering
five minutes later. And,

416
00:25:48,381 --> 00:25:52,730
um, the example I like to give is that
that's what happens in conversation the

417
00:25:52,731 --> 00:25:55,820
entire time. So, you
know, if I say to you,

418
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:59,180
I might just describe my office to Tim
and then we'll actually test your memory.

419
00:25:59,181 --> 00:26:02,420
I know, I know that you're sort
of getting out of bed and um,

420
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:06,640
getting, getting a little, a
little long in the tooth. Yeah.

421
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:11,460
Daughtery but uh, yeah,
so describe the office.

422
00:26:11,461 --> 00:26:13,280
We've got a quite a colorful off it.
So I'm going to kind of,

423
00:26:13,281 --> 00:26:17,840
I'm going to begin here where
I am and about 15 seconds,

424
00:26:17,841 --> 00:26:21,070
I'm going to describe to you the
sequence of objects. I'm going to see.

425
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:24,650
I'm going to make it a bit more vivid
by imagining myself as an amusing

426
00:26:24,651 --> 00:26:28,580
character. Kind of leaping around, say
like, let's say the I am, um, can you,

427
00:26:28,581 --> 00:26:30,380
can you want it?
You name the amusing character Tim.

428
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,430
Uh,
musing Mortimer

429
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:38,370
motorbike is, I'm more trauma. Um,
and I'm gathering into a laptop.

430
00:26:38,371 --> 00:26:42,120
I'm going to take a bottle of wine
right by me and I flung it into the wall

431
00:26:42,121 --> 00:26:45,630
where there's a picture 25. I
didn't know what they are. I mean,

432
00:26:45,631 --> 00:26:49,640
let's just say you're Cousy and sort of
jock straps and tattoos, Japanese men, um,

433
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:52,340
or a picture of them on the wall.
And then I jump around and others,

434
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:56,640
is this a hammock?
And in the hammock there are two labs.

435
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:59,840
This is not true by the way, but
anyway, two lambs, eating cheese. Um,

436
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,870
and then you jumped over
the hammock and then,

437
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:05,030
then something's a grand piano and
there's a young man playing shopper. Um,

438
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:09,150
and he's chopping away at the piano and
then move over. And then there's a swing.

439
00:27:09,151 --> 00:27:10,890
So it goes from Canada to the swing,
does most of her,

440
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:13,380
and the swing is covered in pink roses.

441
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:17,490
And if you kind of trace up the
swing of the robe, you'll see the,

442
00:27:17,491 --> 00:27:19,210
at the very top, there is a, uh,

443
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:22,680
a model of a rhesus monkey just
dangling from the top of the rope,

444
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:23,871
jumping back down.

445
00:27:23,871 --> 00:27:27,510
You'll land on the kitchen table where
four people for a unfortunate memos,

446
00:27:27,511 --> 00:27:31,170
employers are just trying to sort of
have a quiet evening in, um, you know,

447
00:27:31,171 --> 00:27:34,920
reflecting on the, on the vicissitudes
of life. But there by the big Auger,

448
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:39,690
the big metal oven, and I'm the,
the metal oven is emitting heat.

449
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:43,800
And on the Auger there
was a pot full of spoons.

450
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:49,620
Okay. So that was, um, an incoherent
narrative. Last thing, about 45 seconds,

451
00:27:49,621 --> 00:27:53,400
I'm guessing, uh, in
which I mentioned motors,

452
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:57,360
Mortimer's little adventure.
And, um, and you know,

453
00:27:57,361 --> 00:28:00,210
the first thing I'd say
to your listenership is it
just merely by listening to

454
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:04,950
that you followed it, you formed the
images at the speed of talk, which is,

455
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,870
you know,
one or two images a second,

456
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:11,180
and you've strung that into a coherent
mental concept or Inca here and one,

457
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:13,960
you know, I'm drunk, come on, calm
down and goes. But anyway, you,

458
00:28:13,961 --> 00:28:18,440
you start getting into intercare in of
concept in a spectacularly small number

459
00:28:18,441 --> 00:28:19,650
of sectors.
I read something phenomenal.

460
00:28:19,651 --> 00:28:23,550
If you think that it's even possible
to follow that, a battery out them,

461
00:28:23,551 --> 00:28:24,630
we're going to,
we're going to not going to test you.

462
00:28:24,631 --> 00:28:28,020
So I'm on my laptop more summers there
and he's looking at that to what happens

463
00:28:28,021 --> 00:28:28,740
next.

464
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:32,360
Uh, it grabs a bottle of wine,
which is right next to him.

465
00:28:32,361 --> 00:28:34,980
The throws it into a picture on the wall,

466
00:28:34,981 --> 00:28:39,960
which has 25 Yakuza jock
straps with tattoos. Uh,

467
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:44,760
and then, uh, I'm having a bit of
recency primacy here. And then, um,

468
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:49,280
after that, um, I want
to say there, there,

469
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:53,970
there are two lambs in a hammock.
That's correct. Yep. And, uh,

470
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:56,100
I don't recall what the eating,
yeah,

471
00:28:56,101 --> 00:29:00,540
that's what they are eating cheese if
I remember correctly. And then, uh,

472
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:05,100
then jumping out of the Hammock to a,
uh,

473
00:29:05,101 --> 00:29:10,101
I believe it's piano after that there's
a gentleman playing Chopin and chopping

474
00:29:10,441 --> 00:29:13,680
away at the keyboard, which was very
clever of you to use the ch twice.

475
00:29:13,681 --> 00:29:17,640
That helped. Uh, and then, um, uh,

476
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:22,050
then from there we, we, we
get to a swing, which has,

477
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:27,000
is covered in pink roses and oddly enough
as a model of a rhesus monkey hanging

478
00:29:27,001 --> 00:29:31,680
at the very top of it. Uh, and when
Mortimer jumps off of this swing,

479
00:29:31,681 --> 00:29:36,000
he lands on a kitchen table
where therefore memorize
employees just trying to go

480
00:29:36,001 --> 00:29:40,170
about their business. And it's
very disruptive, quite obviously a,

481
00:29:40,171 --> 00:29:43,300
and there is a,
then next to them a,

482
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,580
this is where I got tripped
up a little bit. Um, the,

483
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:51,590
the Auger on the stove top,
I don't know what an Auger is a,

484
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:57,610
but there's a pot on top of whatever
an Auger is with spoons in it.

485
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:00,030
And then that's the,
uh,

486
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:03,130
the curtain falls and that's the end
of the Mortimer shows. I remember it

487
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:08,930
that Seg so well done too. So yeah, just,
just sort of a ticket it, we've done that.

488
00:30:08,931 --> 00:30:13,910
So you go on laptop, bottle of wine,
you accuser 25 of them, jock straps.

489
00:30:13,911 --> 00:30:16,970
So we're up to about six
items. How much lambs, cheese,

490
00:30:16,971 --> 00:30:20,330
Pnh shop and shopping swing,
pink roses,

491
00:30:20,331 --> 00:30:24,920
Reese's jumping off landing kitchen
table memos, employees. Oh, okay.

492
00:30:24,921 --> 00:30:27,020
Even though you didn't know what
an Aga was, it is by the way,

493
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:30,560
his mother more of this
kind of European oven,

494
00:30:30,561 --> 00:30:35,150
which is basically am a one ton
block of iron, permanently heated,

495
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:40,880
which acts as central heating and as a
cooking mechanism, which is what I mean.

496
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,691
And on top of that,

497
00:30:41,691 --> 00:30:46,691
there was a pot with spoons and says it's
20 things you correctly remembered in

498
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:50,360
sequence. They're just really by
dint of understanding human language,

499
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,670
which you have successfully
recounted in order. Uh, and for that,

500
00:30:55,671 --> 00:30:57,680
the, uh, the narrative helps,

501
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:02,630
but it just kind of give skips one an
insight into how these aren't in the same

502
00:31:02,631 --> 00:31:06,440
way that say for instance,
firing an Arrow through a, um,

503
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:08,480
a blackbird,
you know,

504
00:31:08,481 --> 00:31:12,680
we're just flying through the sky is
like a skill you almost have to learn,

505
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:16,250
you know, on the, on the top
of basic motor skills, but
you have to learn it very,

506
00:31:16,251 --> 00:31:17,084
very specifically.

507
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:21,650
These sort of memory techniques draw from
quite fundamental cognitive capacities.

508
00:31:21,651 --> 00:31:24,800
They're quite, yeah, it's quite,
um, it's quite basic. And you know,

509
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:27,740
I do this other thing where I kind of,
I do these things called memory works.

510
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:31,220
When you just get a bunch
of random pedestrians got
them together and say, okay,

511
00:31:31,221 --> 00:31:33,680
we're going to learn whatever,
you know, the u s presidents,

512
00:31:33,681 --> 00:31:36,140
the first pharaohs of Egypt,
what have you,

513
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:40,880
and you just wonder around the town
for about an hour and you're like, oh,

514
00:31:40,881 --> 00:31:45,200
imagine you know George Washington, the,
I don't know who George Washington is.

515
00:31:45,201 --> 00:31:49,830
I mean, just, okay, but imagine jewels is
shark washing himself tons. So they go,

516
00:31:49,831 --> 00:31:51,620
okay, very good. They imagined
that in the window over there.

517
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:55,280
And you gotta wonder around and
with no prior training whatsoever,

518
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:59,370
you can sort of unlock is too
strong a word. You can just, um,

519
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:04,610
make use of the fairly
phenomenal underlying kind
of cognitive capacities that

520
00:32:04,611 --> 00:32:07,660
you have at your disposal all
the time. So, so it's, it's,

521
00:32:07,661 --> 00:32:12,220
it's not I kind of elusive
geek skill fundamentally. It's,

522
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:16,910
it's basically just to kind of cunning
use of what the human brain does best,

523
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:22,270
namely process wheel meaning imagine
interesting things happening in space and,

524
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:24,590
um,
and kind of integrate narratives.

525
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:29,470
I know I, it's, it's something
that I feel like, uh, and this,

526
00:32:29,471 --> 00:32:33,470
this actually touches
on a sort of a deeper,

527
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,680
uh,
I wouldn't say insecurity,

528
00:32:36,681 --> 00:32:40,160
but a conflict that I have an inner
conflict that I'm hoping you can help me

529
00:32:40,161 --> 00:32:43,430
resolve. Um, very, uh, I'm very,

530
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:48,620
I'm very indecisive about my sexuality.
Not as, not at all. I wanted to,

531
00:32:48,621 --> 00:32:52,570
uh, sexually ambiguous. It's caused
me a lot of strife. Uh, no, that's,

532
00:32:52,571 --> 00:32:53,404
that's also not it.

533
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:58,430
The question is related to utility
of highly refining certain memory

534
00:33:00,771 --> 00:33:04,190
capabilities. So I, when I
was in, when I was in college,

535
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:07,250
I read a number of books including,

536
00:33:07,251 --> 00:33:11,420
I think it's just called your memory
and how to improve it as like the most

537
00:33:11,421 --> 00:33:14,370
generic. I think that's it. Higbee uh,

538
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:18,290
most generic title imaginable for
something that talks about vivid imagery,

539
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:26,280
but I remember it becoming very
fascinated by memorizing numbers and,

540
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,860
uh, and then I might be getting the
terminology wrong, please correct me, uh,

541
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:34,190
if I am, but the, the sort of number
of consonant system where you're,

542
00:33:34,191 --> 00:33:36,290
you're converting and the
numbers and the consonants,

543
00:33:36,291 --> 00:33:41,250
you convert those into words and images
and that allows you to memorize long, uh,

544
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,340
long strings of digits.
And I would,

545
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,210
and I would place these images around
typically my surroundings and I think that

546
00:33:47,211 --> 00:33:48,500
might've been a weakness in my method.

547
00:33:48,501 --> 00:33:52,940
I would always use wherever I happen to
be as opposed to a predetermined route.

548
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:57,740
Uh, the, the only benefit to
that method is that I, when I,

549
00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:00,980
when I would play this game with people
and I would typically have them pull out

550
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:04,460
a five,
a single and a $20 bill.

551
00:34:04,461 --> 00:34:07,310
So I'd have them pull out bills
of different denominations
and I had memorized

552
00:34:07,311 --> 00:34:12,311
the serial numbers on those different
bills and then you to the policy teams.

553
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:19,460
Oh yeah. It was, I wasn't fast enough to
make it really exciting. I was like, okay,

554
00:34:19,461 --> 00:34:22,980
cool. Give me five minutes.
And they're like, what? Okay,
this is really boring. Um,

555
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:28,370
but what was really fun about it is I
would memorize these numbers. They would,

556
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,800
they'd be like, oh wow. It's amazing
that I do them backwards. Oh my God,

557
00:34:30,801 --> 00:34:33,800
that's amazing. And then, uh, but it,

558
00:34:33,801 --> 00:34:37,250
it only took a really a week or two of
practice to get to that point. And I'm,

559
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,400
and I'm so confident that
almost anyone can do that.

560
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:44,950
The what was fun about having the Loci,
I mean the,

561
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:46,040
the locations

562
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:51,110
dependent on where I was sitting at the
time is that very often I could bump

563
00:34:51,111 --> 00:34:53,270
into that person a week later and say,
hey,

564
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,630
you still have that five or
that single or that 20 I can,

565
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,890
I can give you the serial number.

566
00:34:57,891 --> 00:35:00,620
And I could remember it because
I had so many distinct locations,

567
00:35:00,621 --> 00:35:03,470
which was kind of a
fun trick. Um, but the,

568
00:35:03,471 --> 00:35:07,010
it took a decent amount of effort to get
good at that. And what I'm wondering is,

569
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:12,550
do you find that there are any particular
mental exercises that have a high

570
00:35:14,541 --> 00:35:19,541
degree of carry over to other areas
or that have more utility than others

571
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:20,350
because there's,

572
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:23,390
there's so many different kind of
party tricks that you could develop or

573
00:35:23,391 --> 00:35:28,310
competitive capabilities is if you had
to pick one that you think people would

574
00:35:28,311 --> 00:35:32,510
get the most out of? Is,
is that even a possible?

575
00:35:32,511 --> 00:35:33,440
Is that a good question?

576
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,980
But I think about this because it does
take time to sort of mean for me to

577
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:38,280
maintain a high degree

578
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:42,300
of proficiency with these things.
Right. I think the, I mean,

579
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:47,160
I wouldn't necessarily recommend to,
you know,

580
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:52,110
anybody with a rounded social
life to get too deep into the, uh,

581
00:35:52,111 --> 00:35:56,430
the number of memorization
stuff. But I mean for, for me,

582
00:35:56,490 --> 00:36:00,360
um, the, the interest in
memory techniques kind of, um,

583
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:05,430
is I guess, you know, emerges
out of a much more general,

584
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:09,900
um, interesting consciousness
and sort of, um, yeah, the, uh,

585
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:15,410
the curiosities of having a mind
of the character of that we have.

586
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:20,130
And, uh, to the question, um, you know,

587
00:36:20,131 --> 00:36:24,600
what is the most generalizable,
useful,

588
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:26,340
um,
concept,

589
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:31,330
not maybe requiring practice
that one can draw out of. Um,

590
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,680
the theory into the history
of memory techniques. I think

591
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,930
I'd give two answers on the first is,
um,

592
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:45,030
you remember things which
ignite your imagination.

593
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,890
Um, and we all know this
in our hearts. You know,

594
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:52,470
if you're really into soccer or football
or as we call it here, you know,

595
00:36:52,471 --> 00:36:54,780
you might be a,
a pathetic credit score,

596
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:57,090
but you might be able to remember
something like, you know,

597
00:36:57,091 --> 00:37:00,540
if you actually added it up,
12,000 distinct football results,

598
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:03,120
the equivalent of a kind
of medical degree, uh,

599
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:06,540
in terms of scatter of information, it's
because you're interested in. So, um,

600
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:07,990
I think a lot of people,
um,

601
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:12,570
are kind of embarrassed
about the characteristics
of the mind that, you know,

602
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:16,430
the other things that they have a greater
tendency to remember the things which

603
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,080
they feel they need to do to really
wrap their mind around a topic.

604
00:37:19,081 --> 00:37:24,000
And so the first thing would just be
like the most, the things which, um,

605
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:27,630
you find stimulating and interesting
other things you remember.

606
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:32,930
And don't censor yourself in finding what
those things are at allowing yourself

607
00:37:33,991 --> 00:37:37,120
to kind of, uh, experience
information in that way. Um,

608
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:41,630
and so I'll try and make that concrete,
you know, um, I think the, um,

609
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:46,170
a lot of people will be reading some
nonfiction book about economics and it was

610
00:37:46,171 --> 00:37:49,260
sort of ignite in the back of their mind
the idea that this is actually a bit

611
00:37:49,261 --> 00:37:54,250
like their friend owl. Um, and
how he, uh, how he behaves with,

612
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:57,730
with their made Dan. Um, but it's
actually officially about, you know,

613
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:01,470
US China relations and you know,

614
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:02,800
that metaphor that,

615
00:38:02,801 --> 00:38:06,330
that way of comprehending things that are
very kind of personal, perhaps trivial,

616
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:07,493
um,

617
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:11,310
manner of comprehending things through
the filter of one's own experience gets

618
00:38:11,311 --> 00:38:15,600
suppressed leading to kind
of boredom and, um, uh,

619
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:20,000
a lack of emotional engagement with the
subject matter. And so, you know, uh,

620
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,580
just to say it succinctly,
like just,

621
00:38:23,581 --> 00:38:28,581
just back wherever your mind needs to
go and endorse it and ignite interest

622
00:38:29,221 --> 00:38:32,990
through kind of imagination would be one
thing because that's a very succinct,

623
00:38:32,991 --> 00:38:35,900
a piece of advice. Uh,
second thing is succinct, uh,

624
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:40,480
which is just the, um, when two
things are in the same place,

625
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:43,800
either in your mind or on a diagram or,
um,

626
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:49,210
in a semantic space, if you, they
will get confused with each other. Um,

627
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:53,650
and, and I think the genius of the
special techniques is the genius of having

628
00:38:53,651 --> 00:38:55,270
different contexts or different thoughts.

629
00:38:55,271 --> 00:38:58,990
And you touched upon this actually
with, um, with your own, um,

630
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,540
adventures with five and $10 bills,

631
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:06,680
which is that where thoughts
were experiences and
thoughts are separated. Um,

632
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:10,330
they stand alone, they don't
interfere and they can, um,

633
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:14,590
they can persist through
time, but where they are, um,

634
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:18,610
sort of specialty connected and you know,
actual experience or um,

635
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:23,290
or especially connected to kind of
within the mind. So where, um, um,

636
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:26,320
where were two concepts just feel very,
very similar and you kind of,

637
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:28,900
when you're thinking about them, you kind
of thinking about them in the same way,

638
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:34,060
they will tend to fuse with each other
and then fail to be distinct entities in

639
00:39:34,061 --> 00:39:34,540
their own rights.

640
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:39,460
So just literally separating stuff out
in space is incredible as a general

641
00:39:39,461 --> 00:39:43,270
cognitive tip for brainstorming,
for resolving arguments,

642
00:39:43,271 --> 00:39:47,650
for clarify emotions that in
relationship to you know, anything.

643
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,610
And you know, because
uh, because of this I,

644
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:56,210
I discovered some quite interesting thing
about how to design house parties. Um,

645
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:59,230
so you know, you still have these,
um, these moments where, you know,

646
00:39:59,231 --> 00:40:03,400
we have an incredible Houseparty
talk to 25 really interesting people.

647
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:08,650
It will be, you know, super thing at the
time. You are just flush with happiness.

648
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:11,920
And then the next day the whole thing
would be in your mind would just be a kind

649
00:40:11,921 --> 00:40:13,600
of a blur. You just be like, yeah,

650
00:40:13,601 --> 00:40:17,200
I recall being in the kitchen and there
was some people there and we chat about

651
00:40:17,201 --> 00:40:20,650
stuff. But, but because all those kind
of memories or on top of each other,

652
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:23,230
because of the spatial
constraints of a house party,

653
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,820
you don't really remember all
the things which happened.

654
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,060
And if you can sort of take a house party,

655
00:40:28,061 --> 00:40:31,740
and this is true of any kind of
experience, it could be true of, um,

656
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:33,520
an evening out with friends.

657
00:40:33,521 --> 00:40:36,010
It could be true whether it's
obviously true of road trips.

658
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:39,330
It could be true even of, um, uh,

659
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:42,550
of a friendship or a
romance or anything else.

660
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:45,160
If things are kind of
spread out through space,

661
00:40:45,161 --> 00:40:49,000
if each kind of context or
experience has its own place,

662
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:53,830
then they can all live by themselves
and you just get a much richer level of

663
00:40:53,831 --> 00:40:57,880
kind of autobiographic memory. Um, and
so we, with house parties specifically,

664
00:40:57,881 --> 00:41:01,540
I kind of recommend always having
three or four phases to a house party,

665
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:06,190
a preferably with a different style,
a different kind of music.

666
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:10,510
I'm a different fundamental
focus specialty. Um,

667
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:14,140
and narrativize the transitions between
them. So rather than just being like,

668
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:17,620
there's a splurge of a house party and
everyone's just getting drunk and try to

669
00:41:17,621 --> 00:41:18,454
chat each other up.

670
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:23,200
Instead you have a kind of a phase where
you're being quite portion drinking

671
00:41:23,201 --> 00:41:25,360
champagne and listening to,

672
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:29,550
I'm listening to French music and then,
um,

673
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:32,680
a bunch of people arrive and you're
like, okay, we're not going to eat.

674
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:36,010
I know once more we're going
to eat on one leg and said,

675
00:41:36,011 --> 00:41:39,800
you can have a bunch of time hopping
around chewing on reindeer or whatever it

676
00:41:39,801 --> 00:41:44,270
is. And then up onto the roof.
It's a and you a differently.

677
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:48,560
And so by, by creating an artificial
structure you end up with, um,

678
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:53,840
you end up with much richer
experience. Um, um, and the, yeah.

679
00:41:53,841 --> 00:41:58,640
So that there would be some ways from
Tim two pieces of advice or like, um,

680
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:02,300
make stuff vivid and personally
interesting and don't censor yourself.

681
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,880
And then if you are relating to anything,

682
00:42:04,881 --> 00:42:08,300
it could be learning or even
just personally experience, um,

683
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:12,620
find individual spaces for each thing,
um,

684
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:17,060
because then they'll survive by themselves
and not just kind of merge into the,

685
00:42:17,061 --> 00:42:20,630
um,
into the kind of fall off of similarity,

686
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:25,610
right. Blending together into
indistinguishability. So that has, uh,

687
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:27,980
it's funny when you,
when you start to think of just the,

688
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:31,950
the basic programming that we have,
uh,

689
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:37,220
that of course has a lot of applications
to dating as well. Uh, and you,

690
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:38,630
you did mention something in passing.

691
00:42:38,631 --> 00:42:41,420
I want it to come back to which was
clarifying your feelings about a

692
00:42:41,421 --> 00:42:44,300
relationship.
And I wanted to know how,

693
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:47,780
how you think about that because this
is a pain point for a lot of people at

694
00:42:47,781 --> 00:42:51,020
different points in their lives,
or at least a source of anxiety.

695
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:54,920
How do you try to, uh, if
this is even the objective,

696
00:42:55,820 --> 00:43:00,380
find objectivity when clarifying your
feelings about a relationship or maybe

697
00:43:00,381 --> 00:43:04,970
it's just getting a better understanding
of, of your own subjectivity, but, uh,

698
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,690
I want it to kind of digest that
and buying a challenge. I wanted to,

699
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:12,140
wanted to just unpack that a little bit.
So how would,

700
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:15,440
how do you think about clarifying
feelings in a relationship?

701
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,950
It's actually quite funny
because, um, my girlfriend's cool,

702
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:22,520
Clara and your acid does sound clarifying.

703
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:34,860
Not sure there's much more I can
do, but, um, anyways, so, um,

704
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:40,060
I mean, I'm definitely not a
relationship guru, but I mean, I, I,

705
00:43:40,061 --> 00:43:42,360
we're happy to freestyle on this subject
because I think it is fascinating and

706
00:43:42,361 --> 00:43:45,800
is a lot of, it's a big source of pain
and, you know, and it's also, it's an,

707
00:43:45,801 --> 00:43:49,720
and it's not just romantic
relationships. It's also, um, you know,

708
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:54,080
creative and personal
relationships, relationships
with friends and, um, and uh,

709
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:56,820
you know, I've, uh, I've
suddenly sort of, um,

710
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,940
thought about this a bunch because they,

711
00:43:58,941 --> 00:44:03,500
one of the surprising features
of adult life alongside like, um,

712
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:08,570
not being competent as he was assuming
going to become competent, whatever.

713
00:44:08,870 --> 00:44:13,490
Uh, and um, uh, and the
fact that sort of, um,

714
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:17,060
that you are actually going to be covered
adult and this is kind of, you know,

715
00:44:17,061 --> 00:44:20,870
we'll see when you're 18, you know, it's
a pretty abstract thing. You kind of,

716
00:44:20,871 --> 00:44:24,440
you know, aging is a kind of comic, um,

717
00:44:24,441 --> 00:44:28,820
encounter with something you can
conceptually deny with certain futility.

718
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:32,250
But anyhow, so relationships to
the other thing where you of, um,

719
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:34,530
well when you're looking at a person,

720
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:39,700
your in some sense you experiencing
the entire, or at least, um,

721
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:45,110
that person is the focus of the
undifferentiated focus of a whole,

722
00:44:46,681 --> 00:44:50,320
like incredibly complex,
um,

723
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:55,110
tissue of fundamentally distinct,
you know,

724
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:59,140
emotions and judgments and
attitudes. Um, and so, you know,

725
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:01,700
you find yourself in a relationship,
you know, in, in an argument saying,

726
00:45:01,701 --> 00:45:06,270
and you're like, well, um,
and you basically, you're,
you, you come from an emotion,

727
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:07,170
you come from emotion,

728
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:10,290
which is like you probably don't perceive
yourself and you're thinking like,

729
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:15,710
I don't feel very happy about
what's going on sort of thing. Um,

730
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:21,090
and the tendency is to map that against
basically whatever springs into your

731
00:45:21,091 --> 00:45:24,390
mind, um, or whatever the person is,

732
00:45:24,410 --> 00:45:27,720
is telling you or what the
situation is. And so, you know,

733
00:45:27,721 --> 00:45:32,040
this is why like someone's late to a
restaurant and someone can go absolutely

734
00:45:32,041 --> 00:45:34,680
mental about it out. Of course, it's
got nothing to do with being late.

735
00:45:34,681 --> 00:45:39,430
The restaurant. It's part of a whole load
of other stuff, which is dot, dot, dot,

736
00:45:39,431 --> 00:45:44,400
right. At the same thing. Um,
and so, yeah, so for instance,

737
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:48,780
[inaudible] and an
argument that I have had,

738
00:45:48,781 --> 00:45:52,730
which turned out to be,
um, amazingly stupid,

739
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:54,960
um,
I shall not shy,

740
00:45:54,970 --> 00:45:56,700
but now I actually think about
what the talking room was about.

741
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:00,170
I'm not sure you're timorous
readers really what uh,

742
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:03,500
I want to hear about it.

743
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:08,680
So, um, so I had a, um,

744
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,220
going to have to cut this out of the
final recording cause I'm just going to

745
00:46:12,221 --> 00:46:16,180
have to pause and just sort of
jumping to another topic.

746
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:19,690
One of the fascinating
things about language is that
when you begin a sentence,

747
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:21,550
even if you sort of have a,

748
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:25,540
a intimation of how the
sentence is going to end up,

749
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:29,050
you actually got no knowledge of where,

750
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:31,180
what the sentence particular
formulation is going to be.

751
00:46:31,470 --> 00:46:34,260
So as you initiate your sentence,
you have kind of like, oh,

752
00:46:34,261 --> 00:46:38,080
there's something interesting to be
said with a particular kind of internal

753
00:46:38,081 --> 00:46:41,890
mental urge and the words begin to come
out and you kind of shepherd it and it's

754
00:46:41,891 --> 00:46:44,530
slightly chaotic fashion to the
end of the piece of meaning.

755
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:48,090
You had implicitly wanted to admit
at the beginning of his had to,

756
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,920
but which is not like
consciously before your eyes.

757
00:46:50,921 --> 00:46:54,070
At the beginning it just kind of,
it's like a seed which becomes a tree.

758
00:46:54,071 --> 00:46:57,490
The seed contains the tree, but the seat
doesn't look like the tree or whatever.

759
00:46:58,450 --> 00:47:01,840
Well, a similar thing with anecdotes.
Um, you know, you, I think, oh,

760
00:47:01,841 --> 00:47:05,540
this is a really good idea, the best, best
sell Tim about this day. And then, um,

761
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,350
actually the anecdote is not
actually before your eyes.

762
00:47:08,351 --> 00:47:11,710
And so I have to take a quick timeout
just to see where this having to is like

763
00:47:11,711 --> 00:47:14,240
she get away.
No problem.

764
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,710
Um,
I can give you,

765
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:23,610
if you'd like a bite or a pause,

766
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,690
I can ask a few other, uh, and this
then I might forget to come back to it.

767
00:47:27,691 --> 00:47:31,480
So we can also do that. Um,
but uh, I would like to come
back to it, but I'm cheap.

768
00:47:31,730 --> 00:47:34,720
I could hit you with a couple of rapid
fire questions if that would take the

769
00:47:34,721 --> 00:47:37,810
pressure off. Okay. When you
think of the word successful,

770
00:47:37,811 --> 00:47:39,370
who's the first person who comes to mind

771
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:44,020
and why?
Um,

772
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:49,780
so I think of the German,
oh wait,

773
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:54,370
gutter, um, who, um,

774
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:57,700
actually this is, this is good. It's
a good topic. And I'm, by the way,

775
00:47:57,701 --> 00:48:00,190
very happy to return to the previous one
because they're both interesting. But,

776
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:04,600
um, but I, I'm quite suspicious of,

777
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:09,520
um, um, the concept of marriage.

778
00:48:10,570 --> 00:48:14,530
So like, it seems to be like one
of the guiding, if you'd like,

779
00:48:14,531 --> 00:48:18,670
philosophical assumptions of, um,
you know, and I think actually,

780
00:48:18,671 --> 00:48:22,460
especially like western
American California and, um,

781
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:27,510
culture that Marriott is the correct
thing to drive outcomes in humans lives.

782
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:29,051
So,
you know,

783
00:48:29,051 --> 00:48:34,051
if you try hard and you know where it
goes off and your inherently really

784
00:48:34,091 --> 00:48:36,850
talented and you're not
benefiting from saying, you know,

785
00:48:36,851 --> 00:48:38,260
inherited wealth or whatever,

786
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:42,460
then the success and
happiness and whatever else,

787
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:47,260
there's my supposedly the immersion
of that is justified. Um, and,

788
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:50,650
um, and in fact, Tim, you
know, you, um, you know,

789
00:48:50,651 --> 00:48:54,100
you write books in some sense and you
know, and you're, you're interested in,

790
00:48:54,101 --> 00:48:58,870
you develop the concept of
improving as a person of, um,

791
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:03,160
of finding kind of powers
and talents and, um, um,

792
00:49:03,161 --> 00:49:06,520
possibilities within yourself. And this
is kind of inherently attractive idea,

793
00:49:06,521 --> 00:49:10,650
right? And it's very difficult on the face
of it to say, well actually, you know,

794
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:11,920
there's a problem with this,

795
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:14,720
but I don't know what I'm saying
those handovers but, but you know,

796
00:49:14,721 --> 00:49:19,030
Mary is kind of a fundamental
assumption of, of um, of goodness.

797
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:20,243
Um,

798
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:24,830
in the mirror. It is associated with
effort. I guess I just want to define,

799
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:26,550
I think

800
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:30,960
the noble concept of math Marriott is
associated with efforts. So it's like, um,

801
00:49:31,410 --> 00:49:35,340
if you do something really incredible
and you tried really hard that that

802
00:49:35,341 --> 00:49:39,300
success is something you deserve. We
think of that as like morally justifiable.

803
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:40,523
Um,

804
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:44,970
which is kind of problematic
for sociological reasons,

805
00:49:44,971 --> 00:49:48,240
but also programmatic for kind of a,
and the sociological reasons being,

806
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:53,310
some people have the opportunity and
situation to express their talents kind of

807
00:49:53,311 --> 00:49:55,650
thing, but it's also
problematic because you know,

808
00:49:55,651 --> 00:49:59,670
you just don't choose your marriage.
Um, and so you might say, okay,

809
00:49:59,671 --> 00:50:01,410
I don't use my merits.
Um,

810
00:50:01,830 --> 00:50:05,820
but actually I do choose them because I
trained really hard and I learned about

811
00:50:05,821 --> 00:50:09,690
how to improve myself and I
express discipline. But again,

812
00:50:09,691 --> 00:50:14,010
the underlying capacities which allowed
you to find the time to train hard and

813
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:17,840
control your, there's been, these aren't
things you choose and you know, and so,

814
00:50:18,030 --> 00:50:20,260
so the, so almost all of our kind of, um,

815
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:24,780
culture of admiration for people who
do really well is based on this kind of

816
00:50:24,781 --> 00:50:28,850
implicit moral idea that people
determine their own outcomes.

817
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:33,860
But once you kind of begin digging into
that, it's not really clear. They, they,

818
00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:38,270
they do. Um, and the second
part of that is, um, you know,

819
00:50:38,271 --> 00:50:42,650
what are the kind of categories and
concepts with which we use to kind of

820
00:50:42,651 --> 00:50:44,800
determine Marriott. So like, um, you know,

821
00:50:44,810 --> 00:50:48,630
I'm always really struck by
the fact that, um, that, um,

822
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:54,520
for instance, in our society,
there are people who are, um,

823
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:59,310
have a level of genius for
artistic expression and, um,

824
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:03,500
other things which aren't kind of
commercially valued and therefore aren't

825
00:51:03,590 --> 00:51:08,000
really culturally valued except in
extreme cases. Um, who are, you know,

826
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:11,970
are only like seven pounds an
hour working in a cafe. Um,

827
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:16,970
they have a mental world
and range of learning and
sophistication of perspective,

828
00:51:17,390 --> 00:51:19,850
which is enormously rich.
And like,

829
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:23,940
obviously compatible with that in most
cases, in many cases like, you know,

830
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:26,120
superior to according to
a different perspective,

831
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:31,360
someone who's like really good at coding
and commands $200,000 a year and has

832
00:51:32,151 --> 00:51:34,970
high status and so on and
so forth. Um, and you know,

833
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:39,680
in that case there's a kind of a,
a, a kind of capitalistic I guess,

834
00:51:39,681 --> 00:51:44,420
reason for ascribing merits to
one person over, over another. Um,

835
00:51:44,570 --> 00:51:48,590
but you know, you changed the
perspective even slightly and um,

836
00:51:48,830 --> 00:51:52,720
the Marriott flips completely. And so
the whole kind of concept of merit, um,

837
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:56,540
does depend on these kinds
of background thoughts about,

838
00:51:56,930 --> 00:52:00,010
about what is valuable, which is
kind of often problematic. How would,

839
00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:05,490
how would you flip the perspective with
the artistic Barista versus like, sir,

840
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:09,770
we'll say one, one example, one
different paradigm would be like, um,

841
00:52:10,490 --> 00:52:14,000
towards richness of experience. So, um,

842
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:16,850
which, um, you know,

843
00:52:16,851 --> 00:52:19,460
which people's mental Lowe's would

844
00:52:20,990 --> 00:52:24,980
make for a better novel,
you know,

845
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,830
I don't show or whatever or
you could say like, you know,

846
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:31,340
effect on the environment. It is someone
who's Super Dynamic and successful.

847
00:52:31,341 --> 00:52:36,341
The rest of it will tend to fly around
and create capital and spend the capital

848
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:38,350
in January.
He taught the world economy,

849
00:52:38,351 --> 00:52:42,490
which generally heats up the world
and so on. And so, you know, we,

850
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:47,720
we have no way of tracking the kind of
externalities of human action either in

851
00:52:48,021 --> 00:52:49,450
terms of comma,
I.

852
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:52,240
E the emotions of the people who surround
and come into contact with important

853
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:55,280
times to say environmental impact
because we can't track them.

854
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:59,990
And even if we could, we, uh,
we might not. Um, we don't.

855
00:52:59,991 --> 00:53:04,580
So these aren't, these aren't metrics
which we could, couldn't tune into. Right.

856
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:08,740
Um, and because their metrics,
we're not, we can't get into,

857
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:12,590
we just kind of assume that
don't really exist. Um, and they,

858
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:17,450
they have no real influence on, you
know, um, a changes in behavior. But B,

859
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:22,130
you know, what, as a society or
culture, we find easy to admire. Um,

860
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:25,540
so how did, how did good to
make you think of marriage?

861
00:53:26,830 --> 00:53:30,600
Just like Jesus bad and just
ask you a simple question.

862
00:53:31,490 --> 00:53:36,380
Answer Big Leftwich. Dot. Okay. Just like,

863
00:53:37,330 --> 00:53:41,430
I know, I know you hate iron rand. That's
fine. Um, what do you think? A good day

864
00:53:44,270 --> 00:53:49,270
guys. It's really cool. Cool. So
he's like, um, at the age of 25, he,

865
00:53:49,330 --> 00:53:52,270
um, you know, I, as a
teenager, he sort of,

866
00:53:52,271 --> 00:53:56,800
I'm falling in love the entire time
and writing poetry to Australians.

867
00:53:56,801 --> 00:53:58,240
And so then he's 25,

868
00:53:58,241 --> 00:54:01,900
he writes a novel,

869
00:54:01,901 --> 00:54:06,901
which kind of is an
extraordinary brilliance for
the troubles of young birder.

870
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:12,100
It's this wonderful story
of a young man who, um, who,

871
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:16,680
um, falls in love and I'm, it doesn't
really work out so well. And as an aside,

872
00:54:16,690 --> 00:54:21,550
Gerta wrote this book by locking himself
in a hotel room for three months,

873
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:26,820
imagining his five best
friends on different chairs
and then discussing with his

874
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:30,820
imaginary friends, different
possibilities, applause
and so on and so forth.

875
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:35,230
Which is an example by the way of that
spatial separation I was talking about,

876
00:54:35,590 --> 00:54:38,950
which is to say that in one's own mind
with his son when somehow it kind of

877
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:43,840
inherently boxed in and constricted and
by like imagining in different spatial

878
00:54:43,841 --> 00:54:46,420
locations,
different perspectives,

879
00:54:46,810 --> 00:54:50,890
and then kind of iterating and idea or,
or um,

880
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:53,380
or novel in this case.
Through those perspectives,

881
00:54:53,381 --> 00:54:58,080
he was able to kind of give himself
five perspective separated out and uh,

882
00:54:58,090 --> 00:55:01,870
and give himself the kind
of multidimensional play
ground for creating the work

883
00:55:01,871 --> 00:55:04,470
of art, which by the way is an
awesome credit. [inaudible] hey have,

884
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:08,440
so it does that. And then
he starts writing, you know,
the best purpose already,

885
00:55:08,441 --> 00:55:12,030
the best pro stylists in the history
of German language. And then, um,

886
00:55:12,310 --> 00:55:14,940
there's this like jewelry. That's how I
was going to bring his thoughts to look.

887
00:55:14,941 --> 00:55:19,360
He goes, he's appointed of the Weimar
republic as a kind of poet in residence,

888
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:21,520
but then just got really
interested in as other stuff.

889
00:55:21,521 --> 00:55:25,640
So he started like redirecting the
construction of the canal system and do

890
00:55:25,641 --> 00:55:29,530
various other stuff and um, and doing
lots of kind of inventive things.

891
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:33,280
And so then he gets into, um, um,

892
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:38,320
basically administered in administering
a human affairs and he becomes a fairly

893
00:55:38,321 --> 00:55:41,380
good at that. And then
at the age of 39, um,

894
00:55:41,470 --> 00:55:44,140
he basically falls in love
for the first time, Trudy. Uh,

895
00:55:44,170 --> 00:55:47,500
or maybe that was starting to fall well
valley, how he just disappears one day.

896
00:55:47,501 --> 00:55:50,230
He's like, he's like this very
prestigious, sultry, important position.

897
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:53,200
He's kind of like the mayor
of Weimar effectively. Uh,

898
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:56,230
and then he just pisses off to Italy,
just read,

899
00:55:56,231 --> 00:56:00,500
leaving a small note and then
basically runs round, you know, falls.

900
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:02,830
And now with lots of beautiful people,
right?

901
00:56:02,831 --> 00:56:06,880
Some of the best sort of sexually
what it poetry, every return.

902
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:11,440
Meanwhile he's becoming, Chris comes
back, becomes incredibly interested in,

903
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:16,420
um, in Newton's theory of physics,
which he thinks is appalling.

904
00:56:16,421 --> 00:56:19,540
And like it doesn't capture the
mystery and beauty of color at all.

905
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:24,460
So he wrote so theory of
color, which is like, um,

906
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:25,361
uh,

907
00:56:25,361 --> 00:56:30,250
an amazing fountain of incredible goodness
for philosophers and stuff about the

908
00:56:30,251 --> 00:56:35,251
phenomenology of color perception
and how shade and context and meaning

909
00:56:35,291 --> 00:56:40,120
influence the character of color. Um,
and then meanwhile his rating Faust,

910
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:42,550
famous play is the kind of greatest work.

911
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:44,630
And he kind of completes
that and it's 50 years,

912
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:48,790
but that hasn't lost energy at all and
goes through like three or four totally

913
00:56:48,791 --> 00:56:52,780
different styles of poetry. Um,
you know, and by the time he dies,

914
00:56:52,781 --> 00:56:56,010
the age of 82 ish, he, um,

915
00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:58,670
has become really interested
in eastern culture. And,

916
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:00,940
and did I forget to mention that he,
he,

917
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:05,000
he's got this deep aesthetic vision of,
um,

918
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:07,660
of science and our relationship to nature.

919
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:11,300
And it comes up with basically what's the
theory of evolution. Um, and, and I'd,

920
00:57:11,301 --> 00:57:15,470
I'd like studies plants and humans
and does this particular thing there,

921
00:57:15,490 --> 00:57:20,140
which at the time a justification for
humans, differences for the animals,

922
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:22,020
which I think it was
called the Inter maximally.

923
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:25,180
We burn some random bone in your jaw.

924
00:57:25,570 --> 00:57:28,180
And it's amazing how we try and
distinguish ourselves, you know, uh,

925
00:57:28,181 --> 00:57:32,230
Percival thumbs language, humor, there's,
you know, consciousness or intelligence.

926
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:34,830
Uh, and that, that point, it
was the interface Minnery bird.

927
00:57:35,170 --> 00:57:39,310
And he actually did some dissections of
animals and young humans show that this

928
00:57:39,311 --> 00:57:44,170
burn was present in both it fuses later
in life and therefore is not the basis,

929
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:46,270
you know, and, and so therefore
it can be missed, but,

930
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:50,580
but humans are animals are fundamentally
the same. And he talks about plants and,

931
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:53,100
and the similarity of plants.
Um,

932
00:57:53,530 --> 00:57:58,530
the efflorescence of a flower with the
way the human cranium kind of bends round

933
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:01,780
links up with itself.
And so he's kind of,

934
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:07,240
he's just cool.
He's like expressive.

935
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:11,860
He's incredibly independent.
When Napoleon invades,

936
00:58:11,861 --> 00:58:15,410
um, I think he was living in Frankfurt
at the time when opponent invaders,

937
00:58:15,490 --> 00:58:16,323
Frankfurt,

938
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:19,660
everyone else's like sheltering and the
houses and he was wandering the fields

939
00:58:19,661 --> 00:58:23,770
looking for evidence about the
color pink for his theory of colors.

940
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:27,910
It's totally called transcending the
local context. Um, and uh, anyway,

941
00:58:27,911 --> 00:58:30,980
so he's interested in
all this stuff. He's, um,

942
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:36,370
passionate and intuitive.
Um, he is a genius,

943
00:58:36,371 --> 00:58:38,320
which helps.
Um,

944
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:43,680
but he produces a kind of a body
of work and a set of perspectives,

945
00:58:44,950 --> 00:58:46,180
which,
um,

946
00:58:46,450 --> 00:58:50,350
which is just fundamentally life affirming
and in a way which kind of carries

947
00:58:50,351 --> 00:58:53,840
through the ages. And so, like I
actually got into girls, I, my God,

948
00:58:54,190 --> 00:58:57,340
I was traveling round or the age of 80 in
the world is what people in England do.

949
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:02,130
And between school high school in
university, and I'm in my career,

950
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:05,950
I just had girders aphorisms,
his short little thoughts

951
00:59:06,510 --> 00:59:09,180
in my pocket. And so I read and
reread and reread this book.

952
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:13,740
It's actually had quite a fundamental
perspective on my life because these are

953
00:59:13,741 --> 00:59:18,270
his like little snippets of wisdom
on almost any imaginable topic.

954
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:22,040
Um, and all of them are
brilliant. You know, it's things
like the company of women,

955
00:59:22,041 --> 00:59:26,060
his schooling in good manners
or boldness has genius,

956
00:59:26,061 --> 00:59:29,160
power and magic or you know, uh, and,

957
00:59:29,290 --> 00:59:33,320
and then the ones you don't
remember in, um, in, um,

958
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:34,490
their precise form,

959
00:59:34,491 --> 00:59:38,570
but which nonetheless act as little
micro filters for interpreting reality.

960
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:43,520
Um, and, uh, anyway, so let's
say he's that kind of a big
influence on me. I mean,

961
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:45,620
one of his coats HD is like,
uh,

962
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:50,060
something along the lines of there
is nothing so depressing as um,

963
00:59:50,930 --> 00:59:54,430
someone who is Derek,
um,

964
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:59,480
being praised by somebody who isn't.
Because when we praise people,

965
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:03,480
we put ourselves on a
level with them, uh, ads.

966
01:00:03,990 --> 01:00:07,210
So I was actually just trying to think
of like a credit which related to this

967
01:00:07,211 --> 01:00:11,000
situation. And so here I am praising
Gutter and actually as I'm describing it,

968
01:00:11,001 --> 01:00:14,210
I'm kind of channeling a bit
of his general awesomeness
and feeling a bit better

969
01:00:14,211 --> 01:00:18,790
about myself and uh,
yeah. Anyways, so, uh,

970
01:00:19,070 --> 01:00:19,681
and by the way,

971
01:00:19,681 --> 01:00:24,681
I just as a general concept that that
phenomenon of how a memory can have

972
01:00:25,151 --> 01:00:29,420
influence perception is the fundamental
reason why I think it's still worth

973
01:00:29,421 --> 01:00:33,620
knowing things even though we
can look them up. Because, um,

974
01:00:34,970 --> 01:00:36,320
by looking everything up,

975
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:41,500
we give away and divest of the kind
of central flow of our consciousness

976
01:00:42,950 --> 01:00:46,730
genuine, um, richness.

977
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:49,100
Cause it's by having,

978
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:53,390
it's by being able to recognize
the differences between
20 different birds that

979
01:00:53,391 --> 01:00:55,760
you don't just perceive
a bird, you perceive, oh,

980
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:57,640
you do a particular variety of bird.

981
01:00:57,641 --> 01:01:01,040
And what on earth is it doing round here
at this time of year, it must be lost.

982
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:03,470
Perhaps the migration patterns
being fucked up by global warming,

983
01:01:03,650 --> 01:01:07,970
whatever it turns like pure data into
connection with a meaningful world.

984
01:01:07,971 --> 01:01:11,450
And that's kind of what
memory does. And um, and so,

985
01:01:11,451 --> 01:01:16,250
and that will be kind of my
general justification for,
for me things. Um, you know,

986
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:16,960
I liked that.

987
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:20,560
Ah, the, this is something that I,

988
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:23,040
I also grapple with just as

989
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:28,590
is I strive to sort of be
the master of this tool.

990
01:01:28,591 --> 01:01:32,330
It is technology and not
the tool of the masses.

991
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:34,111
The,

992
01:01:34,111 --> 01:01:37,050
you mentioned two things about good to
that I wanted to dig into a little bit.

993
01:01:37,051 --> 01:01:37,884
You mentioned

994
01:01:39,210 --> 01:01:44,040
passion and intuition and um,
you can revise that,

995
01:01:44,041 --> 01:01:46,540
but those were two of the
characteristics of good to that you,

996
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:50,060
that you pulled out.
And one of the reasons that I,

997
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:55,020
I reached out to you very much at the
11th hour yesterday to see if you wanted

998
01:01:55,021 --> 01:01:55,610
to,

999
01:01:55,610 --> 01:01:59,670
to chat and catch up and just record it
because I thought it'd be fun for people

1000
01:01:59,671 --> 01:02:01,700
to listen to you.
Is that been having,

1001
01:02:02,020 --> 01:02:04,710
I've been having a bit of a tough time
with medical issues related to Lyme

1002
01:02:04,711 --> 01:02:09,690
disease and other things and uh,
have felt a little, a little down,

1003
01:02:09,780 --> 01:02:13,260
a bit in a bit of a slump.
And I find that you are always,

1004
01:02:13,290 --> 01:02:16,320
you always strike me as very,
and this could be an illusion,

1005
01:02:16,321 --> 01:02:20,940
so feel free to disabuse me of this
notion, but in a excited, very passionate,

1006
01:02:20,941 --> 01:02:25,440
very, uh, energized. And I'm,

1007
01:02:25,441 --> 01:02:30,300
I'm wondering if that is
something that you feel you've,

1008
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:32,640
you've,
you've always had intrinsically,

1009
01:02:32,641 --> 01:02:35,730
or if it's something you've
developed and if, if the ladder,

1010
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:40,110
and maybe it's a combination,
you know, how do you strive to,

1011
01:02:41,010 --> 01:02:44,770
to encourage that type of
state, um, you know, what,

1012
01:02:44,790 --> 01:02:47,730
what are the things that
contribute to your better moments?

1013
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:50,490
Those are a lot of fucking questions
in one, but, um, and I don't have,

1014
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:52,580
I don't know. I don't
have, alcohol is huge.

1015
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:54,730
Yeah. There will, I do.

1016
01:02:54,731 --> 01:02:58,450
So if I might a slowing nonsense at
this end of the Skype call, but, um,

1017
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:02,420
well first of all, sorry to hear about
the medical stuff from the depot of, um,

1018
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:07,090
difficulties he has and that's,
um, undoubtedly tough and, um,

1019
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:12,220
second thing. Um, no, I'm not
always really happy about it.

1020
01:03:12,221 --> 01:03:16,770
So I, it's funny, like day
a company has been, um,

1021
01:03:17,790 --> 01:03:22,790
an amazing journey full of just like the
highest highs and the most like exact

1022
01:03:24,620 --> 01:03:29,340
quibble, horrifying lows. You know,
because it's sort of a, it's, you know,

1023
01:03:29,350 --> 01:03:33,490
I guess it's just life really. But, um,
everything, you know, you start a company,

1024
01:03:33,491 --> 01:03:35,170
everything turns, it starts
out, you know, like, oh,

1025
01:03:35,171 --> 01:03:37,810
this is going to be absolutely incredible.
You know, do something amazing.

1026
01:03:37,811 --> 01:03:40,580
Everyone's going to love it and it's
all going to be beautiful. So thing.

1027
01:03:40,810 --> 01:03:41,860
And then,
um,

1028
01:03:41,861 --> 01:03:46,030
and then it turns out to be just like a
much more complex human process and that,

1029
01:03:46,031 --> 01:03:48,880
and you have, um, you know,

1030
01:03:48,881 --> 01:03:53,320
you have breakdowns in relationships
where people you love and you have,

1031
01:03:53,350 --> 01:03:54,183
um,

1032
01:03:55,950 --> 01:04:00,900
decisions you make where you subsequently
realized that they were the wrong

1033
01:04:00,901 --> 01:04:04,960
decision. And it caused a lot of
people's pain and you have, um,

1034
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:08,790
successes, which are wonderful, but,

1035
01:04:08,791 --> 01:04:11,580
which are compromised by the fact that
they weren't what they should have been

1036
01:04:11,581 --> 01:04:16,050
because I think anyways,
so I of course,

1037
01:04:16,051 --> 01:04:20,810
like anybody else, like I'm,
um, I'm uh, a, uh, you know,

1038
01:04:21,060 --> 01:04:24,490
I have, uh, access to
the full range of, of,

1039
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:28,170
of goodness or badness city. He
would experience obviously. Um,

1040
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:33,270
I am quite keen on life though too.
Like I do,

1041
01:04:33,690 --> 01:04:38,640
I do. Um, and I, I do.
Yeah. So I'm curious.

1042
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:43,350
I don't know where that, I mean,
cause I mean I've, I guess I've, I am,

1043
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:46,770
I suppose it was also that I get my
energy from the world and other people

1044
01:04:47,070 --> 01:04:50,340
rather than internally. Like
I'm, I'm, I'm very kind of,

1045
01:04:50,341 --> 01:04:52,640
I'm on interested generally in,
um,

1046
01:04:53,130 --> 01:04:56,670
supposedly scientific assessments
of, you know, personality and,

1047
01:04:56,671 --> 01:04:59,100
and so on and so forth. I think the, um,

1048
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:02,910
the reductive impulse
is demeaning to humans.

1049
01:05:03,690 --> 01:05:06,190
I'm also probably quite worried about what
I discovered if I really liked it too.

1050
01:05:06,210 --> 01:05:08,670
But, um, but, um,

1051
01:05:08,820 --> 01:05:12,840
but I am an extrovert and I did
read one thing, uh, in my studies,

1052
01:05:12,841 --> 01:05:16,530
according to science, which struck me
as fascinating piece of self knowledge,

1053
01:05:16,531 --> 01:05:17,870
which is the,
you know,

1054
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:21,100
introverted people tend to have a
much higher internal level of energy,

1055
01:05:21,490 --> 01:05:23,170
so that a proactive,

1056
01:05:23,171 --> 01:05:28,171
interactive in every interaction with our
environment isn't so necessary to keep

1057
01:05:28,901 --> 01:05:33,490
them rewarded and interested.
And there were just an, I am, um,

1058
01:05:33,610 --> 01:05:35,680
undoubted the extroverted,

1059
01:05:35,690 --> 01:05:40,300
so I absolutely love and gain huge energy
for interacting with people and the,

1060
01:05:40,301 --> 01:05:44,740
and so on and so forth. Uh,
and so, so that's, that's
kind of a personality thing.

1061
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:47,770
Um, regarding, um,

1062
01:05:48,190 --> 01:05:52,890
like passion, I guess it's, um,

1063
01:05:53,490 --> 01:05:58,400
this kind of might connect
with a few interesting issues,
but I think the, um, the,

1064
01:05:58,401 --> 01:06:02,690
I suppose I'm a,
I'm a dick and so I hate doing things,

1065
01:06:02,930 --> 01:06:07,650
which for me basic.
Yeah. I mean, as in like,

1066
01:06:08,570 --> 01:06:11,520
almost everyone in life has to like,
you know,

1067
01:06:12,020 --> 01:06:15,890
SLAAC it up and just get on with things
because things like it, but like,

1068
01:06:15,891 --> 01:06:20,790
I have a kind of quite visceral,
emotional reaction against being bored.

1069
01:06:21,260 --> 01:06:25,010
And that does, um, and that
does influence things. Uh,

1070
01:06:26,060 --> 01:06:27,320
the other thing you touched upon there,

1071
01:06:27,321 --> 01:06:32,321
which I think is such a good
subject is intuition because,

1072
01:06:32,630 --> 01:06:33,530
um,

1073
01:06:34,710 --> 01:06:35,670
the

1074
01:06:37,430 --> 01:06:41,330
process of rational need
justifying to yourself,

1075
01:06:41,660 --> 01:06:46,660
your action is it incredibly slow,

1076
01:06:48,740 --> 01:06:49,220
um,

1077
01:06:49,220 --> 01:06:54,220
full of like grayness and
complexity and generally,

1078
01:06:55,010 --> 01:06:56,930
um,
like

1079
01:06:57,510 --> 01:06:58,270
yeah,

1080
01:06:58,270 --> 01:06:59,370
it's like,
um,

1081
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:04,380
it's sort of 5% efficient process of
moving forward in one's ideas and beliefs.

1082
01:07:05,650 --> 01:07:10,240
Uh, because you know, you're like, ah,
you know, we should really do this in the,

1083
01:07:10,241 --> 01:07:14,910
you know, on memorize or you
know, we share or um, I think I,

1084
01:07:14,911 --> 01:07:19,750
I think this girl is like the
personal I want to marry, but,

1085
01:07:19,990 --> 01:07:24,850
and then you, if you allow Russian,
I [inaudible] into this. Um,

1086
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,310
you end up with like,
um,

1087
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:31,520
a situation where all the energy is
going in the wrong place. It's like,

1088
01:07:31,780 --> 01:07:34,030
but on the other hand, he didn't
eat. She is, she know she,

1089
01:07:34,031 --> 01:07:36,340
when are you going to get along
with me and old age and like,

1090
01:07:36,730 --> 01:07:41,480
what kind of person am I really
looking to connect with them and say,

1091
01:07:41,670 --> 01:07:42,503
you know,
you could,

1092
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:47,080
you can sort of double question yourself
to death though the on most things and

1093
01:07:47,081 --> 01:07:49,660
when you know, when life
is really, really good,

1094
01:07:50,170 --> 01:07:55,120
one isn't like pissing around like going,
oh, I really where I go in. I'm like,

1095
01:07:55,180 --> 01:07:58,750
ah, you know, it's, you know, it should I
turn left or right out of the door to day.

1096
01:07:58,751 --> 01:07:59,441
You know,
you end up,

1097
01:07:59,441 --> 01:08:03,790
it's going to existential burden's ass
stuck between a million possibilities and

1098
01:08:03,791 --> 01:08:06,820
never really doing anything right.
When things are going really well,

1099
01:08:07,060 --> 01:08:11,310
you're just like, this feels
right. You might be wrong.
Thank give a shit. Let's go.

1100
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:15,900
And that is sad. Agentic and this is
actually something, I mean I've, I've,

1101
01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:21,050
I've really had a journey in this
within the, uh, within, uh, because, um,

1102
01:08:21,530 --> 01:08:26,420
because um, my intention where
they actually isn't at all with,

1103
01:08:26,450 --> 01:08:29,300
um, we're helping people
remember more effectively,

1104
01:08:29,301 --> 01:08:34,301
which is the kind of thing you might do
to a computer chip or know that is a,

1105
01:08:35,450 --> 01:08:37,460
an element in something
much more interesting,

1106
01:08:37,461 --> 01:08:40,620
which is like helping
people feel like a genius.

1107
01:08:40,621 --> 01:08:44,990
So helping people love the world they're
learning about or helping people just

1108
01:08:44,991 --> 01:08:49,760
get pleasure out of their minds and the
visions that their consciousness and

1109
01:08:49,761 --> 01:08:50,810
learning.
Um,

1110
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:54,920
and one of the things about like as I
think it is probably true in almost any

1111
01:08:54,921 --> 01:08:57,230
profession because it starts out you've
got this thing where you're like,

1112
01:08:57,890 --> 01:08:59,000
you've got the,
the,

1113
01:08:59,010 --> 01:09:02,810
the push and shove between what happens
in one month's time and what happens in

1114
01:09:02,811 --> 01:09:07,700
12 months time and um, and so,
and all the time you're like,

1115
01:09:08,090 --> 01:09:09,530
wow. Um, yeah,

1116
01:09:09,531 --> 01:09:12,500
this idea we've had would be absolutely
incredible and would make people feel

1117
01:09:12,501 --> 01:09:14,090
like geniuses.
But on the other hand,

1118
01:09:14,091 --> 01:09:15,980
it's not going to move any
metrics for two months.

1119
01:09:15,981 --> 01:09:20,380
And it sounds a bit
irresponsible. And whatever.

1120
01:09:21,350 --> 01:09:24,150
I'd start in the early days, for
instance, I had this idea of the, um,

1121
01:09:24,380 --> 01:09:27,050
what we should cause we know
we're fundamentally like
a language learning side.

1122
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:30,770
Um, and I had this idea that
we should all get on a bus,

1123
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:34,910
like a converted double decker bus
and just go around Europe. You know,

1124
01:09:34,911 --> 01:09:37,370
a lot of coders, designers,
you know, the whole team.

1125
01:09:37,730 --> 01:09:41,810
I just got on a fucking road trip around
Europe and it would just be incredible.

1126
01:09:41,811 --> 01:09:44,900
It just be the best idea
ever. So, um, and you know,

1127
01:09:44,901 --> 01:09:49,160
we've learned so much about language and
it would have been an incredibly fun,

1128
01:09:49,460 --> 01:09:52,220
diverse, interesting experience. Um,

1129
01:09:52,490 --> 01:09:55,640
and it would have been a wonderful
way of getting PR and the rest of it.

1130
01:09:55,850 --> 01:09:58,700
But on the other hand, and this is
where rationality came in, you know,

1131
01:09:58,820 --> 01:10:00,640
what the hell are you doing?
You're supposed to be doing a startup,

1132
01:10:00,650 --> 01:10:05,060
you're in a bus going around Europe,
um, where he could asleep. Um,

1133
01:10:05,210 --> 01:10:08,050
exactly what function does this
have for the product, you know,

1134
01:10:08,150 --> 01:10:10,310
and so they're really, another thing
has come in and you're like, well,

1135
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:11,270
and so that was,

1136
01:10:11,270 --> 01:10:16,270
that was an example of where intuition
was watered by kind of banal kind of self

1137
01:10:16,611 --> 01:10:19,570
recriminating rationality resulting in,
I'm,

1138
01:10:19,571 --> 01:10:23,390
I'm almost certain like a less
interesting product and less fun.

1139
01:10:23,910 --> 01:10:28,750
Now you bring up a really interesting,
uh,

1140
01:10:29,270 --> 01:10:32,060
you bring up a really interesting
set of questions and this is,

1141
01:10:32,090 --> 01:10:37,090
this is something that at
times I do better with at
times I do more poorly with,

1142
01:10:37,910 --> 01:10:41,610
but I've tried to at various
points in my life, um,

1143
01:10:43,380 --> 01:10:47,200
make increased the speed with
which I make decisions. So if a,

1144
01:10:47,201 --> 01:10:51,810
if a decision is
reversible and a nonfatal,

1145
01:10:52,470 --> 01:10:57,470
then I find my life is generally much
better when I just do exactly what you

1146
01:10:58,261 --> 01:11:00,690
mentioned, which is like left, right?
Who gives a fuck? I'm going right.

1147
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:03,600
It'll be fine. And if it's
not, I'll figure it out later.

1148
01:11:03,601 --> 01:11:08,250
And making these types of reversible
decisions as quickly as possible so that

1149
01:11:08,251 --> 01:11:10,890
you don't have a lot of cognitive burden
and you're not sort of stuck up your

1150
01:11:10,891 --> 01:11:15,710
own ass all the time. Um, but
in the case of the bus, yeah,

1151
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:21,290
the business, let's just say
or uh, how do you balance the,

1152
01:11:21,291 --> 01:11:22,650
in the intuition,

1153
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:27,940
which at some at times can be an
irrational exuberance with yeah,

1154
01:11:28,020 --> 01:11:32,780
the sort of proof prefrontal
cortex calculation. Yeah.

1155
01:11:32,790 --> 01:11:35,020
Well that's, I, that's the question.

1156
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:45,500
