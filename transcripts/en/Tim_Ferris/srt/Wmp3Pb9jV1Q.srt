1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:02,380
So it is cold.

2
00:00:02,381 --> 00:00:06,850
It is miserable on a
Friday here in California.

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:10,390
And I was in San Jose and I
thought to myself, why even bother?

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:12,680
I should just do something
completely unproductive.

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,500
So I came up here to Berkeley to do what
any emotional eater would do and that

6
00:00:17,501 --> 00:00:22,501
is consumed massive quantities of
chocolate at one of my favorite chocolate

7
00:00:24,011 --> 00:00:27,340
makers in the world.
Scharffen Berger here in Berkeley.

8
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:29,470
So let's go kill my pancreas.

9
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:34,890
So here we are here with dried and Brian,
what's your job?

10
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,990
What's your full name? Is My name
Rankin's here. And I am a, uh,

11
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:45,520
and uh, just here you, uh, show you a
little bit about what we do here and uh,

12
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:47,900
take some chocolate. All right, so this,

13
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,440
this is an excuse for me
to eat massive quantities,

14
00:00:50,441 --> 00:00:52,840
a chocolate and a have insulin,

15
00:00:52,841 --> 00:00:55,510
pour out my eyeballs and just
have a good time in the process.

16
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:00,610
Those of you who follow me in and
the blog and know that my diet,

17
00:01:00,611 --> 00:01:04,690
Saturday's my off days. So Saturday I'm
Olathe anything. I want it, it's Friday.

18
00:01:04,691 --> 00:01:07,280
So I'm taking it in a bit early this week.
Uh,

19
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,960
but generally at night I
will have a nightcap of a
glass or two of wine and some

20
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:16,570
relaxing listening to music as well
as a couple of nibs of chocolate. Uh,

21
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:20,380
usually the higher cocoa concentrations.

22
00:01:20,381 --> 00:01:23,950
But I'm going to let you take the floor
and just walk us through what we have

23
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:27,550
here. Sounds good. Well this is our,
uh, this is our current line up here.

24
00:01:27,551 --> 00:01:32,520
We have a number of different
chocolates. Um, here on,

25
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,540
on our right here we have our extra dark,
which is an 82% kick content.

26
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:40,250
Now that that could count content,
uh,

27
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:45,300
really signifies the amount of the
percentage of this bar that comes from the

28
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:47,650
podium.
So 82% of that is,

29
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:51,640
is from the cocoa beans and 18% is,

30
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,400
is sugar and a small amount of
vanilla and a small amount of western.

31
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,100
So this is our darkest chocolate.
If you're looking at, you know,

32
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:01,050
pure Cacau Coco Punch.
Um,

33
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,810
then we have our 70% or 62.

34
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,410
All right, this is our, this is our,

35
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:11,200
and then we have our milk chocolate
and milk chocolate is 41% get cow,

36
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,930
which doesn't sound like a lot,
but it actually is. That's a very,

37
00:02:13,931 --> 00:02:15,460
very dark milk chocolate.

38
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:20,660
Really gives a great combination of both
no flavor and also a chocolate flavor.

39
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,050
And then we have a new bar that we just
came out with, which is our milk Coleman,

40
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:27,460
um, with uh, with sea salt, which has,

41
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,970
which is our traditional milk chocolate
with almonds, dusted with sea salt,

42
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:36,320
sort of that sweet and sour
or sweet and salty flavor.

43
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,460
And then we have a limited edition
bar that we came up with recently,

44
00:02:40,461 --> 00:02:44,540
which is a blend of several different,
very unique beans from Trinidad,

45
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,610
Grenada, the Dominican Republic.
And also then as well. So, you know,

46
00:02:48,611 --> 00:02:52,080
this I saw earlier in the shop and I
was excited to try it because this,

47
00:02:52,081 --> 00:02:53,050
this version over here,

48
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:58,060
the 70% is actually really what
I use along with the guitar.

49
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:00,220
They make some good,
uh,

50
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:04,750
but the Scharffen Berger 70% is
what I've used to make truffles.

51
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:08,110
I took classes with a
chocolate tier in Saratoga,

52
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:10,930
which is a nice small town
you might have visited before.

53
00:03:10,931 --> 00:03:15,280
Also great for motorcycle riding. And so
I have a lot of experience with the 70%,

54
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:20,370
but I'm looking forward to tasting the
full spectrum or at least taking us

55
00:03:20,591 --> 00:03:22,600
through a tasting of Chaga.

56
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:26,350
Cause I think most people they would
be familiar with the concept of wine

57
00:03:26,351 --> 00:03:30,640
tasting. Maybe they know a few different
types of wine. Sure. Uh, perhaps even tea.

58
00:03:30,641 --> 00:03:33,370
They know a few different types of tea,
but shut people of chocolate.

59
00:03:33,371 --> 00:03:36,280
I think they might think
of dark and milk chocolate,

60
00:03:36,281 --> 00:03:39,970
but really not much beyond that
distinction chair. Um, and just,

61
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:43,660
just for the sake of giving people
a full idea, white chocolate,

62
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,570
my understanding isn't even shop,
isn't it?

63
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:50,770
It's the cocoa butter and or well it is
technically chocolate according to the

64
00:03:51,401 --> 00:03:54,010
FDA. Okay. Um, but it's uh,

65
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,490
it actually has in it is chocolate
because it contains a component of,

66
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:02,080
of cocoa beans, which is the, which
is the cocoa butter. Right. However,

67
00:04:02,081 --> 00:04:04,610
it doesn't have as, as you
can tell, it's, it's white.

68
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,510
It doesn't have the cocoa solids,
which loosely translated,

69
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,980
it's really the cocoa powder.
So it doesn't have the,

70
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:14,470
a lot of the components that
are healthy food. Right. And uh,

71
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,860
and it's oftentimes very sweet.
Okay, cool. Well, let's, uh,

72
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:20,740
what else do we have here?
So at least I see the samples here,

73
00:04:20,741 --> 00:04:23,050
but what are we looking at right here?
And then here we had, we just had,

74
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:28,080
these are some raw cocoa beans from
Madagascar and then we have this year is

75
00:04:30,681 --> 00:04:32,560
some,
some nibs from Madagascar.

76
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:37,690
This is from this next one
is from a farm in Trinidad.

77
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:43,440
And then we also have a selection from
a deep in the glory and the mountains of

78
00:04:43,931 --> 00:04:46,290
Venezuela.
Um,

79
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:50,470
these beans have you come
on horseback to get to us.

80
00:04:50,471 --> 00:04:55,050
So wow. Or a long trip
from Venezuela to, well,

81
00:04:55,051 --> 00:04:59,480
it also area and also involve the garbage,
getting them out of the mountain.

82
00:04:59,481 --> 00:05:00,550
So it took a while.

83
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:05,440
So it's a very unique being in
terms of it's genetics and the nibs.

84
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,030
Are those just ships from the cocoa beans?
Yeah,

85
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:14,050
essentially nibs are cocoa beans that
have been roasted and then had to show

86
00:05:14,051 --> 00:05:17,980
him. Okay. So you wouldn't want to show
those, you wouldn't want to chew on these.

87
00:05:17,981 --> 00:05:21,940
But if you roasted them and took the
shell off and sometimes they're hard to

88
00:05:21,941 --> 00:05:22,774
take off button,

89
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:28,090
we can see that there is a show
sort of like uh Oh reskin sure.

90
00:05:29,021 --> 00:05:33,300
A little bit harder. Then inside of
there is actual those bids. It's a, yeah,

91
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,880
it's the sort of immediate,
the bean,

92
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:38,380
the caudal Eden's of the seats
per product developer. Right.

93
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:40,690
That's your technical title.
Um,

94
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,870
your product developers at companies
like Yahoo and other places.

95
00:05:43,871 --> 00:05:48,190
But I think being a product developer
at Scharffen Berger and means something

96
00:05:48,191 --> 00:05:50,290
quite different. So
what, what is your job?

97
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:54,910
What do you actually do as a product
developer? Well, it's uh, it's in general,

98
00:05:54,911 --> 00:05:56,020
it's research and development.

99
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:00,020
So I work with several other people
in the company to source beans.

100
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,720
So we actually traveled to different
countries and by the book of these,

101
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:08,030
we work with the farmers to help them
to improve their quality of their cocoa.

102
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,530
And then you are able to buy it from
them, usually at a higher price, which is,

103
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:16,140
which is a great relationship because we
received higher quality beans and they

104
00:06:16,141 --> 00:06:17,240
receive a higher price for them.

105
00:06:17,241 --> 00:06:21,680
So it's a really mutually beneficial
relationship. Um, so that's one component.

106
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:25,610
The other component is actually making
and maintaining some of these blends here.

107
00:06:25,611 --> 00:06:27,700
So Shark Hamburger,
um,

108
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:31,130
we've always taken a traditional
look at chocolate and that,

109
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:35,620
and we'd like to find a chocolate
for a number of reasons. Um,

110
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:37,750
it creates a more consistent land.

111
00:06:37,751 --> 00:06:41,030
It also can create a more
complex chocolate flavor profile.

112
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:44,750
So when you say blood, do you mean the
different deans from different sources?

113
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:48,770
So it'd be like a maritime,
the right word.

114
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:53,960
Blending varietals. Okay.
Exactly. Cool. Um, our founder,

115
00:06:53,961 --> 00:06:57,710
John Scharffen Berger, came
from the champagne business
where that's very common,

116
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:03,230
um,
creating and developing complex flavors,

117
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,890
a number of different meetings.
He's sort of our, is our forte.

118
00:07:06,891 --> 00:07:11,120
And you can see here we have,
for instance, this bar here has,

119
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:15,590
has between eight and 11 different beans
in it at any given time. And you know,

120
00:07:15,591 --> 00:07:18,990
sometimes a certain sort of, uh, you know,

121
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:21,700
it might be less available
and at a certain time of year,

122
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:25,610
so we'll have to insert another,
another type of view.

123
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,890
And therefore we're constantly changing.

124
00:07:27,891 --> 00:07:30,290
And we have a flavor profile
that sort of locked in our heads.
