can be found@fourhourworkweek.com
forward slash podcast and thank you for

12
00:00:35,381 --> 00:00:36,214
listening.

13
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:41,590
I think this attitude I can flat
out before my hands start to shake.

14
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:51,240
I'm a cybernetic organism living
does show what metal endoskeleton.

15
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,330
Does religion play

16
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,080
a large part in your life right now

17
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,240
in a certain sense?
Not in a kind of a ritual success.

18
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,250
I just wrote a book called
what technology wants

19
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,300
excellent book.
I highly recommend it.

20
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,660
Theory of,
of technology.

21
00:01:12,661 --> 00:01:16,290
And I was trying to put technology
in the context of the cosmos.

22
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,680
So I think what religion gives me
his permission to think about cosmic

23
00:01:22,561 --> 00:01:23,191
questions.

24
00:01:23,191 --> 00:01:28,191
I'm right in the middle of finishing a
Kickstarter funded graphic novel that's

25
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:30,990
about angels and robots.

26
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:35,991
And the intention there was
to fictionalize the idea
that robots would some days

27
00:01:37,141 --> 00:01:40,320
have souls, but these souls
would be coming from angels.

28
00:01:40,321 --> 00:01:44,670
And so that there was this intersection
of these two and if possible worlds of

29
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:49,320
conscious robots who were in,
sold by angels and, and the,

30
00:01:49,321 --> 00:01:53,030
and the reason why this
was sort of interesting was
that the idea was that, um,

31
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,690
the angels that insole us
have been trained, they had
been given moral guidance,

32
00:01:57,691 --> 00:02:02,691
but if you don't give the spirits and
kind of moral guidance than they can wreck

33
00:02:03,481 --> 00:02:07,260
havoc. And so it was this
idea that when we make robots,

34
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:10,110
we're actually going to have
to train them to be ethical.

35
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,970
We can't make a free
being and not train it.

36
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:20,090
So it was a way to rehearse and think
about some of the consequences of

37
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,810
technology today.

38
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,960
So I think my religion gives me
permission to ask those questions without

39
00:02:27,121 --> 00:02:29,200
embarrassment to say, well, um,

40
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,490
what is the general direction
of the arc of evolution?

41
00:02:32,491 --> 00:02:33,990
What is it pointed somewhere?

42
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:39,180
How does technology fit
into the greater cosmos?

43
00:02:39,181 --> 00:02:42,000
What does it mean?
What drives it?

44
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,570
Why is there more of it?
Is this a good thing?

45
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,050
And so I think having a kind of,

46
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:53,940
I consider this kind of an other
view. So I have, uh, other view, the,

47
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:57,990
I'm sympathetic to other world views.

48
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,650
I don't necessarily have to believe
all the other world's you'd,

49
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:04,900
but I get the idea that if you have
an another world view that can be very

50
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:09,340
helpful in seeing other worldviews.

51
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,580
So people have a worldview,
even though they don't know it.

52
00:03:12,581 --> 00:03:16,670
But I have a review and I
know that I ever, I mean,

53
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:21,800
really everybody has a religious
or a spiritual orientation.

54
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,830
Even if they're atheists,
they still have one.

55
00:03:24,831 --> 00:03:28,730
And so there are some assumptions
that are at the basis of it.

56
00:03:28,731 --> 00:03:32,540
And I like to question assumptions,
including my own assumption.

57
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,220
Two things I can't resist asking and we
can spend as much or as little time on

58
00:03:38,221 --> 00:03:38,821
this as you'd like.

59
00:03:38,821 --> 00:03:43,020
But recently grappling with a lot of
these issues of that I've been grappling

60
00:03:43,021 --> 00:03:45,930
with, some of which are existential,
some which are related to death,

61
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,700
limited time on the planet.

62
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:52,790
I've become deeply fascinated by
indigenous use of plant medicine.

63
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:59,550
And I've had some very transformative
experiences that are difficult to put into

64
00:04:00,661 --> 00:04:03,210
words because they make you sound
like a complete crazy person.

65
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,410
But yeah,

66
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:12,840
there's a somethingness that is a very
difficult to communicate without sounding

67
00:04:12,841 --> 00:04:14,790
like you should be institutionalized.

68
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:19,970
What do you think the role for people
who aspire to do the greatest good in the

69
00:04:19,981 --> 00:04:20,760
world,

70
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:25,760
what is the role of that type of direct
experience and is it possible to benefit

71
00:04:26,521 --> 00:04:29,220
from that type of,
for lack of a better descriptor,

72
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,670
spiritual experience without a
religious framework around it?

73
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:36,700
Yeah, no, it's, it's a
really good question. So my
little personal story there,

74
00:04:36,701 --> 00:04:38,140
of course the,
I was basically,

75
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,040
that was basically hippie or worked
for the hippie catalog and [inaudible]

76
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:45,340
catalog, which was about hippies
living in San Francisco. And, um,

77
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,970
all my friends were drug taking hippies,

78
00:04:48,971 --> 00:04:51,340
but I for some reason never did.

79
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:56,460
I just had no appetite or inclination
at all for ever taking any drugs or

80
00:04:57,131 --> 00:05:01,600
smoking pot or anything.
And when I was 50 years old,

81
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:03,520
I decided that I would like to,

82
00:05:03,521 --> 00:05:06,880
to take Lsd sacramentally
on my 50th birthday.

83
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:10,640
And I did and I arranged with,
uh,

84
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:15,660
had a guide and I had appropriate setting
and I had some acid that I came from a

85
00:05:16,451 --> 00:05:21,451
source that was extremely reliable and
it was a sacrament and it was a very

86
00:05:23,111 --> 00:05:26,110
profound sacrament. And I think, yeah,

87
00:05:26,111 --> 00:05:30,310
you can use drugs and recreationally and
for entertainment and I think that can

88
00:05:30,311 --> 00:05:32,890
go somewhere. But I think there
was another powerful use of it,

89
00:05:32,891 --> 00:05:34,230
which is kind of what
you're talking about it,

90
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,810
which is to elevate one
outside of yourself,

91
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,600
to lose yourself,

92
00:05:40,601 --> 00:05:44,500
to be in contact with other
things beyond your ego.

93
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,140
And I think it can be done.

94
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:51,180
And I think unfortunately because of
the illegal status that we've had for a

95
00:05:51,401 --> 00:05:52,234
long time,

96
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,810
the rituals and the practice around that
have not had chance to be developed or

97
00:05:55,811 --> 00:05:58,820
communicated. Actually trying to find
this information. It was extremely hard.

98
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:04,050
It was one book that I did find
eventually from a guy who was doing LSD

99
00:06:04,611 --> 00:06:09,611
experiments while they were still legal
and was able to accumulate enough wisdom

100
00:06:11,211 --> 00:06:15,140
about it that that would be the
one place I would point people to.

101
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:20,141
But I think it is important that the
context and expectations and the,

102
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:24,590
the setting they call it, that that
revolves around it is very important.

103
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:29,590
And I do believe that these
can be extremely profound
and powerful experiences

104
00:06:31,251 --> 00:06:35,450
for good. They can remain
long after. And you know,

105
00:06:35,451 --> 00:06:38,270
most people who understand
this and don't abuse it,

106
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:41,670
understand that in fact the
experience was not in the pill,

107
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,410
was not in the chemical.
It was a real experience.

108
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:50,470
And so unfortunately there's so much
other stuff circulating around the use of

109
00:06:51,021 --> 00:06:53,600
these drugs and the misuse of them that,

110
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:56,930
that it kind of information is often very,
very difficult to find.

111
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:02,710
But I do think maybe we're seeing a
moment now in the u s where the second

112
00:07:03,261 --> 00:07:08,261
prohibition is being undone and at least
pot will become legal and maybe we can

113
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:15,340
return to revitalizing the
traditions and the necessary,

114
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:20,780
uh, settings are around that and
expectation that I'm not just potter LC,

115
00:07:20,781 --> 00:07:25,781
but even other synthetic drugs can be
extremely powerful in removing the,

116
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:32,630
um, ordinary guards that we have. And
when we have an ego for on purpose,

117
00:07:32,631 --> 00:07:37,110
we have all these things to keep
us sane in a day to day. Um,

118
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:41,780
functional exactly. Standpoint. Yeah.
Right. And so if you remove a completely,

119
00:07:41,781 --> 00:07:44,000
you can become dysfunctional,

120
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:48,980
but if you remove it deliberately and
with great care, you can be opened up.

121
00:07:48,981 --> 00:07:52,550
And I think it's that, you know, I
think there's an expertise there.

122
00:07:52,551 --> 00:07:54,950
I think there's a lot of other
things that, that, that, um,

123
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:58,280
if we have the freedom and
the wisdom to not abuse it,

124
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:03,260
I think it can be extremely powerful. Do
you recall the title of the book? Okay.

125
00:08:03,261 --> 00:08:07,370
So this is, or how people might
search for him? Yes. So this is, uh,

126
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,180
one of the many resources
that I recommend in my book.

127
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,980
Cool tools and cool tools is a
big catalog of possibilities.

128
00:08:15,981 --> 00:08:19,880
It has about 1500 different items.
A lot of them are kind of like handles,

129
00:08:19,881 --> 00:08:23,390
you know,
pliers and the grape cordless drill.

130
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,020
But it's much farther than that.
And I include things like,

131
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:31,160
what if you wanted to have a psychedelic
experience that was transformative.

132
00:08:31,161 --> 00:08:33,110
What do you do?
And I would recommend this book or,

133
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:36,650
or I mean there's lots of
other things in it, but the,

134
00:08:36,651 --> 00:08:40,430
I don't actually have the book in front
of me. I should, I think it's called.

135
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:45,310
Um, I don't remember.
It's okay. I will, uh,

136
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:48,290
I show notes.
We will list it as the right one.

137
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,190
And there's also a little tiny
book that came from England.

138
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:56,850
There was a cartoon guide
that gave of a street,

139
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:00,270
an unjudgemental view of all
the different drugs that were,

140
00:09:00,271 --> 00:09:04,620
and what each one kind of did in Denton.
What the plus and minuses are without,

141
00:09:04,621 --> 00:09:07,480
you know, recommending or forbidding
them. It was just saying this,

142
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:10,290
this is what it is.
That information also,

143
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:12,870
believe it or not is really in
short supply. It's like, you know,

144
00:09:12,871 --> 00:09:16,380
what do you do with this and how's
it work and tell me the facts.

145
00:09:16,381 --> 00:09:18,510
I don't need to hear a lecture either way,

146
00:09:18,511 --> 00:09:20,050
like whether this is
great or this is terrible,

147
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:23,010
but just tell me what what's
going on. As, as you know,

148
00:09:23,011 --> 00:09:26,100
I mean that kind of information
sometimes is extremely in short supply,

149
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:29,980
it's very difficult to find information
that isn't politicized. Yeah,

150
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,350
inaccurate or like you said,

151
00:09:32,351 --> 00:09:37,351
so shrouded in either fear or irrational
optimism that it's almost intelligible

152
00:09:40,061 --> 00:09:42,340
and certainly generally useless.

153
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:44,830
We'll put those books in
the show notes for people.

154
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,160
I want to come back to
one thing you said far,

155
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:51,970
far earlier and that was related to the
pieces that you tried to give away that

156
00:09:51,971 --> 00:09:54,070
eventually wouldn't die and came back.

157
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,070
Were there any common threads,

158
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:02,220
any patterns in those pieces that that
you can pick out as being sort of a

159
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,330
uniquely Kevin Kelly theme
if for lack of a better term?

160
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:13,040
One of the things that I discovered in
my six months of trying to live as if I

161
00:10:13,231 --> 00:10:17,880
was going to die in six months. Because
as I was coming closer to that date,

162
00:10:17,881 --> 00:10:19,080
which happened to be Halloween,

163
00:10:19,081 --> 00:10:22,920
October 31st it was I kept
cutting off my future.

164
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:25,110
I mean maybe like you,

165
00:10:25,111 --> 00:10:27,810
I kind of tend to live in the
future of much more than path.

166
00:10:27,811 --> 00:10:29,760
I'm always imagining I'm
saving this for something,

167
00:10:29,761 --> 00:10:31,980
that I'm going to do this and
I'm kind of looking forward,

168
00:10:31,981 --> 00:10:33,030
I'm going to do this here.

169
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:36,960
And so I was very much in the future
and then something that future was being

170
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:40,800
cut down day by day. I was
like, and I was thinking like,

171
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,210
why am I taking pictures,

172
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,010
taking the photographs because I'm not
going to be here in another two months or

173
00:10:47,011 --> 00:10:47,700
something.
So,

174
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:51,360
so there was all these things that I'm
kind of cutting out and as I was cutting

175
00:10:51,361 --> 00:10:56,130
them out, I had this realization, which
was the thing I took away from this thing,

176
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:01,320
which was that I was becoming less human.
That to be fully human,

177
00:11:01,321 --> 00:11:04,290
we have to have a future.
We have to look forward to the future.

178
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:09,560
That is part of us is
looking into the future.

179
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:14,040
And so after I came out of the,
and I kind of embrace that and saying,

180
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:17,640
well you know that future forward facing,

181
00:11:17,641 --> 00:11:20,380
that's what I do. That's what,
that's what I want to do.

182
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,490
And that's what I write about.
And in thinking about the future,

183
00:11:23,491 --> 00:11:25,440
one of the things that is very hard,

184
00:11:25,441 --> 00:11:29,130
because the paradox about the future is
that there are lots of impossible things

185
00:11:29,131 --> 00:11:30,210
that happen all the time.

186
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,380
And if someone from the a hundred years
from now would come back and tell us

187
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:36,740
things, there's a lot of stuff we've
just not going to believe this.

188
00:11:36,741 --> 00:11:38,250
It's like that's just,
that's crazy.

189
00:11:38,251 --> 00:11:41,520
It's just like if we went back a hundred
years and told them what was going on

190
00:11:41,521 --> 00:11:43,830
now they would say, you know,
that's just not going to happen.

191
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:46,620
I mean we could even go back 20 years.

192
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:50,670
I can go back 20 years and say we're
going to have like Google street views of

193
00:11:50,671 --> 00:11:54,020
all the cities of the world and
we're going to have, you know,

194
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:57,370
and it's like a PD this for free, this
edited by anybody. You know, I was like,

195
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:00,730
they would say, you know, there's
no way I would tell them, you know,

196
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,810
most of it's for free.

197
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:06,940
They were saying there is no economic
model in the world that allow for that and

198
00:12:06,941 --> 00:12:10,640
there isn't. But here it
is. So the dilemma is,

199
00:12:10,641 --> 00:12:15,641
is there any true forecast about the
future is going to be dismissed any future

200
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:21,040
that is believable. Now it's going to be
wrong. And still you're stuck in this.

201
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:26,650
Like if people believe it is wrong,
if they don't believe it, you know,

202
00:12:26,651 --> 00:12:28,340
where does it get you?
You're just missing.

203
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:33,370
So there was this very fine line between
saying something that is right on the

204
00:12:34,061 --> 00:12:37,660
edge of plausibility at the same time,

205
00:12:37,661 --> 00:12:40,330
right on the edge of having
a chance of being true.

206
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:45,930
And what I discovered that was helpful
and trying to get away from the kind of

207
00:12:47,171 --> 00:12:49,060
assumptions that binus had,

208
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:53,350
just kind of extrapolate
was to think laterally,

209
00:12:53,351 --> 00:12:56,170
was to go sideways.
One thing,

210
00:12:56,171 --> 00:13:00,010
just take whatever was everybody knew
and say, well, what if that wasn't true?

211
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,390
A good example of that or an
example like everyone says, okay,

212
00:13:04,391 --> 00:13:08,440
Moore's law will continue Moore's law.
It didn't continue. What would that mean?

213
00:13:08,441 --> 00:13:09,180
What would happen,

214
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,970
and you can maybe I could
say for the audience,

215
00:13:11,971 --> 00:13:14,100
but I'll just say even to remind me,

216
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,100
Moore's law is what
does it every 18 months,

217
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:22,470
the the size and cost of technology will
decrease by 50% something along those

218
00:13:22,471 --> 00:13:25,860
lines. Let's say even worse,
there's speed involved as well,

219
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:28,160
right? More than it does say
that, but, but let's say subbing.

220
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:32,630
Right now we live in a world where
every year the technology is better and

221
00:13:32,631 --> 00:13:37,610
cheaper. What if that wasn't true?
What if every year starting like,

222
00:13:37,611 --> 00:13:41,300
you know, couple years from now stuff
was better but more expensive. That's,

223
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:43,560
that's a completely different world,
right?

224
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:48,050
Everyone assumes that things are
going to get better and cheaper. Well,

225
00:13:48,051 --> 00:13:51,980
what if that wasn't true? So you can
take kind of an assumption that, again,

226
00:13:51,981 --> 00:13:55,790
that's something that no one's
really examining like, uh, well,

227
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:58,400
one of the things I write about is
the fact that we're going to have a

228
00:13:58,401 --> 00:14:00,830
population implosion globally,

229
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:05,860
that the global population
will drastically reduce in
a hundred years from now.

230
00:14:06,771 --> 00:14:09,890
We'll have less population far, far,
far less than we have right now. And so,

231
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,380
all right, I have to bite it. That what,

232
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,290
because I've thought a lot about this
and the a, what would they call it?

233
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:19,030
The Mel Malthusian dilemmas.
Is that going to be,

234
00:14:19,031 --> 00:14:22,570
do you think pandemic related, nuclear
weapon related, all of the above?

235
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:27,040
None of those. None of those,
no. Ai Coming into the,

236
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:28,540
the rise of the machines?
No.

237
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:31,190
Okay.
It's just pure demographics.

238
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:35,780
So if you look at the current trends
in fertility rates in all the developed

239
00:14:35,781 --> 00:14:37,730
countries everywhere,

240
00:14:37,731 --> 00:14:42,680
except for the u s they're already
either below replacement level.

241
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:48,530
So replacement level of means that you
just sustaining the population just

242
00:14:48,531 --> 00:14:50,960
replaces itself. If it's
below, it means that there's,

243
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:55,610
it was getting less and less. So
Japan, all of these, you know, Europe,

244
00:14:55,611 --> 00:14:57,140
they're all below replacement.

245
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,700
The U S is an exception because
of only because of immigration.

246
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:03,330
Got It.

247
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:04,021
Where people coming in,

248
00:15:04,021 --> 00:15:06,630
otherwise we would be there and it
just would not be any news to anybody.

249
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:10,210
But the real news of people would
point a developing world. But you know,

250
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:14,970
Mexico is now aging faster than the u s
China is aging faster because of their

251
00:15:14,971 --> 00:15:19,020
one child policy. Of course, Japan is
this completely is there a way underwater?

252
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:23,610
Completely. So even the one
exception is Subsahara Africa.

253
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,240
And there's really a kind of debate right
now about how fast or whether they're

254
00:15:29,281 --> 00:15:33,630
slowing down, but generally around the
world, South America, the rest of Asia,

255
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:36,270
the rate and fertility continues to drop.

256
00:15:36,271 --> 00:15:41,220
And here's the thing is that the
demographic transition that is happening

257
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,380
everywhere where people become urban.

258
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:48,650
And so every forecast shows the urbanity
the certification of the population

259
00:15:49,051 --> 00:15:49,884
continuing.

260
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:55,010
And I can't think of any counter force
to stop these huge migration at the scale

261
00:15:58,831 --> 00:16:01,590
that we're seeing into the city.
And as that happens,

262
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,050
the birth rates dropped down.

263
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:09,650
And even in places like Singapore or
other places where they have taken very,

264
00:16:09,691 --> 00:16:14,691
very active countermeasures of cash for
having kids and daycare forever bonuses,

265
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:23,340
none of these work in terms of actually
trying to raise fertility levels.

266
00:16:23,341 --> 00:16:27,170
So you have to understand that
to go above replacement level,

267
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,820
the average woman has to have 2.1 kids.

268
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,340
Well that means it has to be tons and
tons of women who have three or four kids

269
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,480
make up for those.

270
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:40,760
How many people do you know
with that many kids, you know,

271
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:45,150
living in cities and there's just
not, there's not enough of them. So,

272
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:49,350
and this is a projection. Some of these
are you in productions, they have three,

273
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:49,711
three,

274
00:16:49,711 --> 00:16:54,711
they have a low high and a medium and
the low one is not good news because

275
00:16:55,410 --> 00:17:00,180
there's not a large cultural counter
force for women to have three a lot,

276
00:17:00,181 --> 00:17:00,481
you know,

277
00:17:00,481 --> 00:17:04,890
a very high percentage of the publishing
to have three or four kids in a modern

278
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:05,724
world.

279
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:10,080
And that's why the the published and
continues to decrease every year.

280
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:13,410
What type of,
this is perhaps a tangent,

281
00:17:13,411 --> 00:17:18,411
but one of the big debates in my head
right now is to marry or not to marry,

282
00:17:19,561 --> 00:17:20,520
to have kids or not to have kids.

283
00:17:20,521 --> 00:17:25,230
I never thought those would even be
questions in my mind and yet here I am in

284
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:29,940
and now they are. What are your thoughts
on having children? What type of people?

285
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:33,750
This is very broad but should have
children or shouldn't have children.

286
00:17:33,751 --> 00:17:37,590
Whichever way of answering is easier or
how to even think about that question.

287
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:42,200
I think people who are privileged of
which you are should have children because

288
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:47,290
you can bestow so many privileges and
opportunities to your children and if the

289
00:17:49,621 --> 00:17:50,730
world has to be populated,

290
00:17:50,731 --> 00:17:54,750
why not populate it with children who
have as many opportunities as possible.

291
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:59,610
I also say from my own experience of
growing up one of many kids and having,

292
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:01,140
well I have three kids.
Uh,

293
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:04,800
one of my other regrets in life is
not having a fourth, but we were just,

294
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:08,670
we started a little bit too late and we
were unable to have a fourth but all my

295
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:11,100
kids with that we had a fourth to,

296
00:18:11,101 --> 00:18:14,850
and I would say that as a gift to
your kids to have more than one.

297
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:20,480
And I know that from hanging out in
shiner where so many kids grew up only

298
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:22,980
children and this really,

299
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:28,190
really miss that there is a total gift
of the siblings and brothers to each

300
00:18:28,921 --> 00:18:32,910
other. That is really very
profound. And there is also,

301
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:37,911
I know from my friends who have had
lots of kids that there is a tremendous

302
00:18:38,911 --> 00:18:40,330
amount of teaching from the,

303
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:44,070
the older to the younger and that's
a lot of what they've learned.

304
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,870
And that the uh,

305
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:49,740
curve of the amount of energy that you
have to expand actually after three,

306
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:53,500
it doesn't really matter in
terms of the parents. Got It.

307
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:57,680
I have one friend who has nine kids and
I have another friend who has seven. Wow.

308
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:02,220
And basically how do they do
that? Well, the older kids,

309
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,990
we're helping to parent the younger kids.

310
00:19:03,991 --> 00:19:05,490
That's the only way that it really works.

311
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,740
But there's actually basically they have,
you know,

312
00:19:07,741 --> 00:19:09,960
they have five parents
instead of having two parents.

313
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,750
Right.
It's very traditional in a way.

314
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:15,020
I mean traditional meaning reaching back
thousands or tens of thousands of years.

315
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:20,090
It is of course in the old days,
maybe a 12 born,

316
00:19:20,091 --> 00:19:22,810
but they rarely had 12 kids survive.
Right.

317
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:26,180
So that actually is a very
recent or I mean as far as like,

318
00:19:26,181 --> 00:19:28,660
it's like the 18 hundreds kind of onward.

319
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:33,080
I hang out with the Amish a lot and they
still have these very large families

320
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,660
and they all survived.
So they have kind of,

321
00:19:35,661 --> 00:19:39,560
in some sense it's sort
of an unnatural expansion.

322
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:42,890
And one of my predictions, again going
back to kind of like the assumptions,

323
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,510
one of my predictions is that,
you know,

324
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:47,610
in America in a hundred years from now
or whatever it is, there'll be, um,

325
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,520
the complete countryside
is run by the Amish.

326
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:53,840
The Amish take over the entire countryside
because they never sell and they have

327
00:19:53,841 --> 00:19:54,674
like eight kids.

328
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,170
And then there are always people living
in the cities and it's like everybody's

329
00:19:57,171 --> 00:19:59,930
happy. You know, you were all living
in the drive out to the Amish lands.

330
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:03,110
It's just fantastic. And uh,
they're very happy, you know,

331
00:20:03,111 --> 00:20:05,330
doing their thing and running the farms.

332
00:20:05,331 --> 00:20:07,540
And so I had been predicting
for years that dom,

333
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:09,560
which would come in and start
buying upstate New York.

334
00:20:09,561 --> 00:20:11,120
And that's exactly what
they're doing right now.

335
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:14,970
Why do you spend so much time with the
Amish? This is news to me, but very,

336
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,550
very interesting.
And how long has that been going on

337
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:18,660
for awhile.

338
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:22,780
And does your beard have anything?
Is there any relation to the Amish?

339
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,180
I had the beard before my
interest in the armory show.

340
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,770
I'll show you some pictures
when I was 19 years old.

341
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,530
I do have those that don't
know I have an Amish beard,

342
00:20:31,531 --> 00:20:33,540
which means that I have a
beard without a mustache.

343
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:37,830
The reason why the Amish don't have
mustaches that was at the time that they

344
00:20:37,831 --> 00:20:39,390
were kind of adopting or dress code,

345
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:42,780
the mustache was all
military men and mustaches.

346
00:20:42,781 --> 00:20:46,970
And so they were very anti military.
They refuse to serve in the,

347
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:48,483
they don't even vote,

348
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,480
but so it was there kind of rejection
of the military by shaving off their

349
00:20:52,481 --> 00:20:53,314
mustache.

350
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:58,510
I hang out with the Amish because their
adoption of technologies is like seems

351
00:20:58,511 --> 00:21:03,511
to us totally crazy because first of all
they're not Luddites complete hackers.

352
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:08,230
They love hacking technology. They have
something called how much electricity,

353
00:21:08,231 --> 00:21:12,880
which is basically pneumatics.
The lot of these farms have a big diesel,

354
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:14,261
they don't have electricity,

355
00:21:14,261 --> 00:21:19,180
but they have a big diesel generator in
the barn that pumps up this compressor,

356
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:23,770
that sense high pressure air
tubes and tubing into their barn,

357
00:21:23,771 --> 00:21:27,370
into the homes and so they have converted
like their sewing machine washing

358
00:21:27,371 --> 00:21:31,060
machine and stuff to nomadic.
Okay.

359
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:35,650
Seems like a bit of a sidestep
of the word of God. Exactly.

360
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:37,100
So we'll have the,

361
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,620
we'll have horse drawn buggies and horse
drawn farm implements and the horses

362
00:21:41,621 --> 00:21:45,660
will be pulling this diesel generated
combine and you're thinking,

363
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:50,380
what are they doing?
Okay. Right. But in fact,

364
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:54,070
if you look at our own lives, and I've
done this many times, I can ask you Tim,

365
00:21:54,071 --> 00:21:54,904
or you can ask me.

366
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:57,790
There'll be some weird thing like
we don't have TV in our house,

367
00:21:57,791 --> 00:22:00,200
but I've got internet. It's like,
well, what is that about? Right?

368
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,830
So we all have these things,

369
00:22:02,831 --> 00:22:06,010
but here's the difference is
the Amish do it collectively.

370
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:08,110
They're very selective.

371
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:13,030
They're selecting their technology
collectively as a group. And secondly,

372
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:15,190
they have to articulate because
they're doing collectively,

373
00:22:15,191 --> 00:22:17,470
you have to articulate
what their criteria is.

374
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:20,740
A lot of us are adopting you try this.
We tried that.

375
00:22:20,741 --> 00:22:25,741
We don't have any kind of like logic or
reason or theory or framework for why

376
00:22:26,951 --> 00:22:30,430
we're doing stuff. It's just,
it's just one a parade of stuff.

377
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:35,050
But the Amish have a very particular
criteria and their criteria is there are

378
00:22:35,051 --> 00:22:37,780
two things that they're looking for,
the main thing they want to do,

379
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,780
and the main reason why they have all
these restrictions like horse and buggy

380
00:22:40,781 --> 00:22:44,710
and all this stuff, is that they
want to have these communities,

381
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:49,330
very strong communities. And so
they noticed that if you have a car,

382
00:22:49,331 --> 00:22:53,050
that you'll drive out and shop somewhere
out of the community or you go to

383
00:22:53,051 --> 00:22:55,450
church somewhere out in the
community or whatever it is.

384
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,570
But if you have a horse and Buggy,
you can go and he 15 miles.

385
00:22:58,571 --> 00:23:01,330
And so everything has to
happen your entire life.

386
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:04,300
You have to support the community.
You have a community within 15 miles,

387
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,090
you have to visit the sick
and you have to shop locally.

388
00:23:07,091 --> 00:23:09,760
So you're shopping with your neighbors.

389
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,550
So when a new technology
comes along and they say,

390
00:23:12,551 --> 00:23:15,910
will this strength in our
local community or send us out?

391
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,660
And then the second thing that
they're looking at is with families.

392
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:24,690
So the goal of the typical Amish man or
women is to have every single meal with

393
00:23:26,351 --> 00:23:29,860
their children for every meal
or lives until they leave home.

394
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,320
They have breakfast, they have
lunch, and they have dinner.

395
00:23:32,321 --> 00:23:37,260
So breakfast and lunch is that they go
to one room schoolhouse and they peddle

396
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:40,060
back for lunch that their
parents had with them.

397
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:44,530
And that means that the businesses are
ideally in their backyard. So they have,

398
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,310
they have a lot of like shops and stuff.

399
00:23:46,311 --> 00:23:48,350
If they're not a farmer and
they have a backyard shop,

400
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:51,980
which is actually has to be kind of clean
ish because it is in their backyard,

401
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:55,760
right? It's like not my, well
it is in their backyard. So
they really are, you know,

402
00:23:55,761 --> 00:23:56,171
they really want,

403
00:23:56,171 --> 00:23:59,060
I'm sure that there of metal working
shops and stuff would say really try to

404
00:23:59,061 --> 00:24:01,730
keep nontoxic and work because
it's in their backyard.

405
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:04,210
And so that means that they
can come home for lunch.

406
00:24:04,211 --> 00:24:05,010
They have breakfast and lunch,

407
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:08,360
so they're there on the premises and
they have every single meal with their

408
00:24:08,361 --> 00:24:12,370
children until they leave.
And so they say, well,

409
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:16,220
what does technology allow us
to do that will help us do that?

410
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:19,430
Or will it work against that?
And then like right now they're,

411
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,770
they've been deciding whether
to accept cell phones are not,

412
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:25,280
even though they don't have landline
phones. So they're basically,

413
00:24:25,281 --> 00:24:26,380
they're going to,
well,

414
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:29,450
some of them are going to accept
cell phones and they do that by,

415
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:34,010
there's always some Amish early adopter
who's trying things and they say, okay,

416
00:24:34,011 --> 00:24:36,230
Ivan Bishop says you can.

417
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:40,280
He had to get permissions is you can
try this, but we're watching you.

418
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:43,640
We're going to see what effect this
has on your family, on your community.

419
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:48,380
You have to be ready to give it up anytime
we say that it's not working and they

420
00:24:48,381 --> 00:24:49,090
do this on a kind of,

421
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:54,090
Paris by Paris is very decentralized and
so they try out always trying out new

422
00:24:55,581 --> 00:24:59,660
technologies and they're always looking
to see does this strengthening the

423
00:24:59,661 --> 00:25:02,120
families is a strengthening the
communities? If not, we don't want it.

424
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:07,810
What have you. I have two questions. I
guess the first is since you're normally,

425
00:25:07,811 --> 00:25:11,470
as I understand it, based on the
west coast and northern California,

426
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:15,520
how do you get out to the Amish or is
there a separate community closer by and

427
00:25:15,521 --> 00:25:19,310
then secondly, what have you
incorporated into your own life or your,

428
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:22,720
you're on family that
originated from the Amish.

429
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:26,420
Yeah. So I don't get to see
them as often as it went.

430
00:25:26,421 --> 00:25:28,070
But actually it was when I go east,

431
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:33,100
I have some contacts that
I will exercise and um,

432
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,491
I would try to get,

433
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:37,460
like to stay overnight and go to
church and a buggy or something.

434
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:41,720
And this is Pennsylvania, but, well
actually Pennsylvania is the heart of it.

435
00:25:41,721 --> 00:25:46,721
But actually there are more communities
in Ohio where my brother lives in Iowa.

436
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,580
There's a lot more happening
in New York, so, so the,

437
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:55,520
the Pennsylvania or the kind of ground
zero, but in fact they're bigger,

438
00:25:55,521 --> 00:25:58,160
more extensive communities
outside of Pennsylvania.

439
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,140
I didn't realize that.
Yeah, the Amish Diaspora,

440
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:05,430
it is what I'm saying. They literally
are just buying up farmland there.

441
00:26:05,431 --> 00:26:07,200
They're expanding,
they're constantly expanding.

442
00:26:07,201 --> 00:26:11,940
They have a very small
attrition rate. Very large
families. They all are buying a,

443
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:14,490
basically they're buying
farms and stuff for their,

444
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:18,670
for their children and they never sell.
And so they also don't,

445
00:26:18,671 --> 00:26:20,790
he move into areas as a,

446
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:23,790
they have a minimum number of families
that we need to move in at once.

447
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:28,410
But what did I learn from the,
well, one of the things that we had,

448
00:26:28,411 --> 00:26:33,411
particularly when we had younger kids
was kind of technological sabbaticals or

449
00:26:33,811 --> 00:26:38,800
satisfy, I should say. And I've now
seen other families who aren't even, um,

450
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,700
you know, aren't even religious.
Adopt that same thing,

451
00:26:41,701 --> 00:26:46,701
which is once a week you
take a break from either,

452
00:26:48,451 --> 00:26:52,400
you could define it however you want
it to screen or the keyboard or, or,

453
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:57,690
or connectivity or something and
you step back and you do that.

454
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:01,940
Not because it's like terrible
or poisoned, but because
it's so good. You know,

455
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:02,970
there's lots of people were kind of like,

456
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,130
they're going to drop out from
Twitter or they're kind of like, oh,

457
00:27:05,131 --> 00:27:07,800
this is like a toxin I got
to get detoxed or something.

458
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:12,090
I think that's entirely wrong way to
think about it is you want to take brace

459
00:27:12,091 --> 00:27:14,700
and it's not because they're toxic,
but because they're are so good.

460
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:19,800
It's like you want to step back so that
you can reenter it and with a renewed

461
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:22,770
perspective with a renewed appreciation,

462
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:26,160
with having spent time
looking at it a different way.

463
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:31,140
And I think that kind of rhythm of
having sabbaths and then yearly Sabbat,

464
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:34,920
uh, vacations, wherever, retreats and
then every seven years or whatever it is,

465
00:27:34,921 --> 00:27:37,110
you take a, um, a true sabbatical.

466
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:42,290
I think that kind of rhythmic
disconnection or Sabbath
I think is very powerful.

467
00:27:43,601 --> 00:27:44,151
It's something that,

468
00:27:44,151 --> 00:27:48,570
that works very well and it was
something that we had in our family.

469
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:53,380
I take Saturdays off as it turns
out, as my screenless day, I really,

470
00:27:53,381 --> 00:27:57,840
I really try to make that a
weekly occurrence and it's
incredible the, yeah, the,

471
00:27:57,841 --> 00:27:58,540
the effect that,

472
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:02,080
that it has this sort of galvanizing
effect of just a mere 24 hours.

473
00:28:02,081 --> 00:28:06,310
Not even that, if you just consider
the waking hours every seven years,

474
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:10,390
a vacation or sabbatical of how long
in your case or your family's guys?

475
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,370
Yeah.

476
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:15,150
Partly because my wife actually is
granted a sabbatical from the company she

477
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:16,290
works for,
which is Genetec.

478
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:21,320
It was one of the few
companies that actually have
a official sabbatical for all

479
00:28:21,761 --> 00:28:26,700
other researchers at least. And
it's very meager. It's six weeks.

480
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,210
Of course, you know, a six week
sabbatical is basically a European and

481
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:35,960
well, the vacation, right?
You know, blackboard,

482
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:38,670
American, right. It's three years,

483
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:43,940
big thing. So yeah. So
we're, we're do something,

484
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:44,691
do something different.

485
00:28:44,691 --> 00:28:49,370
So this year we're taking one and we're
going to camp in national parks for one

486
00:28:49,371 --> 00:28:51,740
month of it. And then the other
two weeks we'll go to Asia.

487
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:54,530
But we haven't been to
allow the national parks,

488
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:58,490
I'm going to do a different
kind of project and I
haven't done before and we'll

489
00:28:58,491 --> 00:29:01,760
do some kind of car camping. We haven't
really done a big road trip like that.

490
00:29:01,761 --> 00:29:02,990
So it's all new for us.

491
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,700
What is the longest in the last few
years that you've gone without checking

492
00:29:06,701 --> 00:29:07,534
email?

493
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:11,270
Oh,
probably two weeks.

494
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,310
And in China.

495
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:18,510
How do you manage that? Well,
but it was like, I just,

496
00:29:18,511 --> 00:29:19,344
I was unable

497
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,630
bigger that because
China was blocking Google

498
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:25,100
makes, makes it, makes
it more challenging.

499
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:30,960
And I was in, um, I was in
some remote places and so
even the connection was hard,

500
00:29:30,961 --> 00:29:34,770
but it was like they weren't, uh,
they weren't letting me get it.

501
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:40,570
I'm not a mobile person. My first
smart phone was an iPhone five and um,

502
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:44,590
I still not using it properly.
I use it for phone call.

503
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:49,300
Yeah. I don't, I don't use my iPhone as
an input device either. I just, yeah,

504
00:29:49,301 --> 00:29:50,430
it just drives me nuts.

505
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,260
Can't type. When I travel, I
liked it to leave everything.

506
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:56,930
I spent a lot of my time
sitting in front of a computer.

507
00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:01,610
I'm kind of like the Zen, you know,
walk walks. It's it, the wobble.

508
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:04,520
So like I'm here,
I'm like really online.

509
00:30:04,521 --> 00:30:07,310
And then when I leave this studio,

510
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:11,660
I don't want to be connected at all and
I won't be, and I'm not checking email,

511
00:30:11,661 --> 00:30:14,390
I'm not checking this other stuff.
And I can go days.

512
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:19,100
Typically I'll go days without choking,
even in the u s if I'm traveling.

513
00:30:19,101 --> 00:30:23,930
And then if I'm overseas I will go
probably a three or four days before I get

514
00:30:23,931 --> 00:30:26,540
the email.
That's pretty typical.

515
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,560
Do you, um, let me shift
gears just a little bit.

516
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:33,610
I'm looking at looking at long
now. Dot Org. Eric Command,

517
00:30:33,611 --> 00:30:37,810
everybody take a look at it. The long
now foundation and humans are generally,

518
00:30:37,811 --> 00:30:40,460
I would say pretty bad
at thinking longterm. Uh,

519
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,300
certainly when it comes to habit change,
very,

520
00:30:43,301 --> 00:30:46,120
very high failure rate
with longterm incentives.

521
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:49,810
You're going to get diabetes in 20 years
for instance as opposed to you'll have

522
00:30:49,811 --> 00:30:53,290
more sex if you have a six
pack when it comes to diet.

523
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:54,700
But the long now foundation,

524
00:30:54,701 --> 00:30:56,860
I just want to read a few things
on this website for people.

525
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:02,340
So the long now foundation was established
in 1996 written as zero one nine nine

526
00:31:02,471 --> 00:31:03,670
six two creatively foster,

527
00:31:03,671 --> 00:31:06,760
long longterm thinking and responsibility
in the framework of the next 10,000

528
00:31:06,761 --> 00:31:10,360
years. Then you have the 10,000 year
clock, which is a monument scale,

529
00:31:10,361 --> 00:31:13,450
multimillion. Yael, all mechanical
clock is an icon to longterm thinking.

530
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:17,560
The Rosetta Project building an archive
of all documented human languages,

531
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:20,890
long bets. Featured bed
is here, Warren Buffet,

532
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:24,010
protege partners and LLC see a public
arena for enjoyable competitive

533
00:31:24,011 --> 00:31:27,520
predictions of interest to society with
philanthropic money at stake and then

534
00:31:27,521 --> 00:31:31,390
revive and restore, which is bringing
extinct species back to life.

535
00:31:31,391 --> 00:31:35,800
So there is a lot here.
Can you explain to people,

536
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:36,431
cause I've,

537
00:31:36,431 --> 00:31:40,780
I've greatly enjoyed many of the
seminars and speeches of the long now

538
00:31:40,781 --> 00:31:42,160
foundation.
I'm a supporter.

539
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:47,430
I suppose I've even spoken there on
stage and love the email Synopsys uh,

540
00:31:47,441 --> 00:31:52,330
that Stewart sends out. What is the
function of the long now foundation when,

541
00:31:52,331 --> 00:31:53,170
what is the value?

542
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:58,770
The Lone Alpha addition is kind of
reactive is it's reacting to the very

543
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:03,300
inherent short term bias that our society,

544
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:06,490
particularly this technological society
particularly say that Silicon Valley

545
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:11,200
exhibits, which is often a focus on the
next quarter or the next two quarters,

546
00:32:11,201 --> 00:32:15,640
the next year results needing
to be immediate, you know,

547
00:32:15,641 --> 00:32:18,880
instant satisfaction.
If something's not on Netflix streaming,

548
00:32:18,881 --> 00:32:20,380
we don't even wait for the DVD.

549
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:25,610
It's this really kind of very fast paced
short term thinking and also somewhat

550
00:32:27,341 --> 00:32:31,800
blinded by the fact that we don't have a
lot of sense of history either. That um,

551
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:36,520
we're kind of ignorant about what's
happened in the past. And so the term,

552
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:41,510
the long now came from Brian Eno who
noticed that we have a very short now,

553
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:44,390
which is like the next five
minutes in the last five minutes.

554
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:49,740
And so the long hours a week is an attempt
to kind of expand that so that we as

555
00:32:49,821 --> 00:32:54,821
a society and as individuals would try
to think about things at a generational

556
00:32:55,551 --> 00:32:56,960
or civilizational scale.

557
00:32:56,990 --> 00:33:01,990
So like how about like working
on something that might
take longer than your own

558
00:33:02,421 --> 00:33:05,360
lifetime to accomplish?
So you start something now,

559
00:33:05,361 --> 00:33:10,361
there may be make it so that it might
take like the cathedrals of all it would

560
00:33:10,491 --> 00:33:12,470
if we were trying to make something that,
you know,

561
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:17,960
might need 25 years to accomplish,
how can we do that?

562
00:33:17,961 --> 00:33:22,130
So we're trying to encourage people
to think in that perspective,

563
00:33:22,131 --> 00:33:27,131
to take that perspective and then
to maybe move in that direction.

564
00:33:27,651 --> 00:33:32,030
We're not necessarily saying we have to
have like the a mohs foundation where we

565
00:33:32,031 --> 00:33:35,870
have to have like a master plan for the
next hundred years and we're going to

566
00:33:35,871 --> 00:33:38,390
plan out the future.
No,

567
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:42,350
we're agnostic about what it
is that people make or do.

568
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:46,680
We're just saying that it
would benefit having, um,

569
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:51,440
thinking about the long term. And
I've often heard, uh, some people, uh,

570
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:56,500
who advised to counseling to individuals
about kind of thinking about the

571
00:33:56,571 --> 00:33:57,740
longterm in your own life,

572
00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:02,060
even though you might want to act
kind of locally and be spontaneous,

573
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:05,780
but you do want you to do one to kind
of keep in mind the fact that you know,

574
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,160
you'll be around for a while,

575
00:34:07,161 --> 00:34:12,161
whether it's putting some savings away
or working on a skill that may take some

576
00:34:13,131 --> 00:34:13,964
time,

577
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:18,140
more than the six months or a
year to acquire or you know,

578
00:34:18,141 --> 00:34:20,810
whatever it is that you
can have both perspectives.

579
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:25,150
And so we're not attempting to get rid
of the need for people to survive the

580
00:34:25,151 --> 00:34:27,740
need for companies to
have a profit this year.

581
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:31,460
We're saying there can be
additional perspectives.

582
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,000
In addition to that where we
say we commit to like a sigh,

583
00:34:37,401 --> 00:34:42,401
a program of science research where it's
a pure science and the results of the

584
00:34:42,621 --> 00:34:46,670
same mathematics is one of the most
profound things that we can invest in.

585
00:34:46,671 --> 00:34:51,671
Even though most of the things in the
beginning seemed to be non utilitarian.

586
00:34:51,741 --> 00:34:55,520
They don't have any purpose, but we
know from our own history that you know,

587
00:34:55,521 --> 00:34:58,790
in 20 years they'll pay
off in some way or other.

588
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:04,120
And so being able to kind of construct
a society so that we can allow the

589
00:35:06,291 --> 00:35:09,540
rewards of longterm investment,
longterm thinking,

590
00:35:09,541 --> 00:35:14,541
long term perspective that would
make us better civilization.

591
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:19,860
I love the long definition. I encourage
everybody to check it out long. Now

592
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,570
