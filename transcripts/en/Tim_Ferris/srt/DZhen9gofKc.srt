1
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:10,420
[inaudible]

2
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,020
hey guys,

3
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:21,020
so why would I ever write a
book again that is this big?

4
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,310
I had no plans to write Trevor mentors,

5
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:31,940
but this past year I turned 40 and a
lot happened in the last say 18 months.

6
00:00:34,651 --> 00:00:39,280
A number of very close friends died.
I've had some very intense, uh,

7
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,360
family issues,

8
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:45,360
my extended family and all those things
led me in addition to growing out my

9
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:50,630
mystical beard to reassess my life and
to want to take a step back and do a

10
00:00:51,571 --> 00:00:54,450
30,000 foot view and ask a
lot of really big questions.

11
00:00:54,451 --> 00:00:59,451
And these tend to be the kind of
questions that I ask in many people ask at

12
00:00:59,521 --> 00:01:02,850
different key forks in
the road, right? Or many,

13
00:01:02,851 --> 00:01:07,800
many forks in the road where might be
college graduation might be the end of a

14
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:12,801
first job after the end of your first
major relationship or midlife crisis,

15
00:01:13,501 --> 00:01:14,640
retirement and so on.

16
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,020
And I realized that I was still
struggling with a lot of things that were

17
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:22,440
longstanding, how to be kinder
to myself, how to say no,

18
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,560
how to separate the signal from the noise.

19
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:30,120
So of course as you get more successful
as anyone even has a small amount of

20
00:01:30,121 --> 00:01:33,090
success, your problems don't
go away. You just trade up,

21
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,870
so you used to have the
say Pinto of problems,

22
00:01:36,871 --> 00:01:38,550
then you get the Corolla of problems,

23
00:01:38,551 --> 00:01:43,551
then you get the Mercedes of problems and
also your attackers and detractors get

24
00:01:43,741 --> 00:01:48,300
more and more sophisticated, powerful
and so on. I was looking for help.

25
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:53,280
I was looking for help sorting out what
the next four years might look like and

26
00:01:53,281 --> 00:01:56,970
for you that could be, you could be 20
it can be 80 the questions in the same,

27
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,350
many of the questions are the same

28
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,090
and I had a certain mentor group,

29
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:08,220
but I found myself trying to do it on my
own and I knew a lot of the same people.

30
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,760
Very, very smart. But I dreamed
of reaching out to certain folks.

31
00:02:11,761 --> 00:02:13,050
Like what would Dan Gable,

32
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,930
legendary wrestling coach who
was a Demi God to me growing up,

33
00:02:15,931 --> 00:02:17,670
what would he do in this scenario?

34
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:22,830
How would he think about physical training
after a certain age when maybe your

35
00:02:22,831 --> 00:02:27,600
joints aren't what they used to be,
or if I wanted to 10 x 100 x my results,

36
00:02:27,601 --> 00:02:32,601
what would one of the founders of
Facebook say or on a day to day basis what

37
00:02:33,211 --> 00:02:35,700
tools they find most useful?
What do they travel with?

38
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:39,930
All of these types of questions led
me to then ask myself, all right,

39
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,720
I'm trying to do too much
heavy lifting on my own.

40
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:45,330
What would this look like if it were easy?

41
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:50,390
The answer I came up with in journaling
was reaching out to a dream list of

42
00:02:50,491 --> 00:02:54,930
people and asking them all the same 11
questions are so some of them I'd refined

43
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:59,090
through the podcast. Tim Ferriss show
now has more than 200 million downloads.

44
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:04,060
Had a chance to really get to a surgical
precision with certain questions and

45
00:03:04,061 --> 00:03:05,620
then a bunch of that I wanted to add.

46
00:03:05,621 --> 00:03:08,500
What do you do when you feel
unfocused or overwhelmed?

47
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,950
Specifically what do you do or
what questions do you ask yourself?

48
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,810
How do you say no?

49
00:03:13,811 --> 00:03:18,811
How have you built rules for yourself or
systems to say no to more things and so

50
00:03:19,061 --> 00:03:22,480
on, and that's how we ended
up with tribe of mentors.

51
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:25,450
How did I choose people?
It's a really,

52
00:03:25,451 --> 00:03:30,190
really eclectic group of people and I
actually want to read one quote at the

53
00:03:30,191 --> 00:03:30,521
very,

54
00:03:30,521 --> 00:03:34,810
very beginning that I thought it was
very important and relevant to my life in

55
00:03:34,811 --> 00:03:39,550
this book, and this is from
Marcel Proust, p r o u s t quote.

56
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,990
The only true voyage would beat not to
travel through a hundred different lands

57
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:45,100
with the same pair of eyes,

58
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:49,680
but to see the same land through a
hundred different pairs of eyes. Right?

59
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:52,720
Do you have a different lens through which
to look at your challenges, problems,

60
00:03:52,721 --> 00:03:54,010
opportunities,
relationships?

61
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:59,260
So I found 130 or so of them and I
want it to cover everything I wanted to

62
00:03:59,261 --> 00:04:03,670
cover. Health, wealth,
happiness, fitness, longevity,

63
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,310
everything imaginable thinking systems.

64
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:10,750
So it ranges from say
writers and teachers,

65
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:14,050
Steven Pressfield, Susan Cain,
people that you may know,

66
00:04:14,051 --> 00:04:18,910
like Terry crews for instance.
All of their lessons. Matt
Ridley Zone, Saint John,

67
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,770
I on Hirsi Ali.
It's a long list,

68
00:04:20,771 --> 00:04:24,190
but then there are people you might
not recognize. And what I've found,

69
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:27,970
if you look at say the podcast of
the top six episodes of all time,

70
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,410
three of them,

71
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,680
50% are of people are involving people
you probably didn't hear of before the

72
00:04:35,561 --> 00:04:38,800
podcast. So I'd say at
least, well first of all,

73
00:04:38,801 --> 00:04:41,710
95% of the people in the book
have not been on the podcast.

74
00:04:41,711 --> 00:04:44,650
And then at least half of them
you've probably never heard of.

75
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,050
But it includes the creators of a theory.

76
00:04:47,051 --> 00:04:51,400
I'm all of these icons of cryptocurrency
actors and so on, like Ben Stiller.

77
00:04:51,401 --> 00:04:55,240
Then you have crossfit champions,
Neil Gaiman,

78
00:04:55,241 --> 00:04:59,830
temple Grandin athletes like Kelly
Slater who has the distinction of,

79
00:04:59,831 --> 00:05:03,670
I think being the youngest person
ever to win the equivalent of a World

80
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,940
Championship and surfing and then the
oldest. All right, so how do you do that?

81
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:11,500
Right? What books have informed his
thinking and training and so on. Uh,

82
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,310
also,

83
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:17,310
one of the things that I did is as I
collected answers and interviewed people,

84
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:22,300
if a name came up repeatedly,
I would go after that name.

85
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,100
So say Steven Pinker,

86
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,160
you have say the authors of
Sapiens and Matt Ridley and so on.

87
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,900
All these names kept recurring.
So I reached out to them.

88
00:05:31,901 --> 00:05:35,560
So you'll find as you read this
book, as they mentioned, mentors,

89
00:05:35,561 --> 00:05:38,710
influences books and so on.
They're tied to other people in the book.

90
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:43,300
There's this entire web mesh of knowledge
and patterns and so few people who

91
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,020
have read this book,

92
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:47,800
my close friends like Matt Mullenweg
have said that it's easier,

93
00:05:47,801 --> 00:05:51,790
it's easier to spot patterns in this
book than in any other book that I've put

94
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:53,200
together.
Uh,

95
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:58,230
so that allows you then end me to put
together a B spoke toolkit of your on for

96
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:05,150
any challenge, any opportunity that
you might have in front of you.

97
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:10,690
This has some type of tactic or routine
or tool that you can apply immediately

98
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:16,490
and it's intended to be used that way.
This is a reference book.

99
00:06:16,491 --> 00:06:17,570
It's also a,

100
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:23,140
in case of emergency break glass book
that you can digest and tiny five to seven

101
00:06:24,141 --> 00:06:28,700
page increments. It's not a to z. This
is a choose your own adventure book.

102
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:33,530
So that is how it came together.
I didn't plan to put it together.

103
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,600
It just needed to come together for me.

104
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:40,250
And hopefully you will find it
as useful as I have the guys,

105
00:06:40,251 --> 00:06:42,860
is you're enjoying the tips
and tactics and how to,

106
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:47,360
on this channel or in the podcast, the
Tim Ferriss show, I made this for you.

107
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:50,180
Tribe of mentors,
short advice from the best in the world.

108
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,170
This is the book that I wanted to read.
So I went out and I put it together,

109
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:59,390
created a dream list of 130
of the best at what they do.

110
00:06:59,391 --> 00:07:03,170
People who are icons, legends, and
ask them all the same questions.

111
00:07:03,171 --> 00:07:07,280
These are people in some cases I wanted
to reach out to my whole life ranges

112
00:07:07,281 --> 00:07:11,660
from many, many billionaires,
cofounders of every company imaginable,

113
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:16,010
elite athletes ranging from surfing to
tennis, to powerlifting, everything else,

114
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,140
country stars, actors, directors,
and you can spot the patterns.

115
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:24,080
So some of my friends have said,
this is the easiest to read,

116
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,080
most useful book that
I've put together yet.

117
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:31,550
So checking out tribe of mentors.com
you can find sample chapters,

118
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:34,730
the whole list of mentors,
everything, tribal mentors.com.
