1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,790
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02,791 --> 00:00:06,060
I can run flat out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,530
I'm a cybernetic organism

4
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,400
is brought to you by a new sponsor.
So listen up folks.

5
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:30,390
This is a good one because have you ever
wanted to be as powerful as a mullet

6
00:00:30,391 --> 00:00:35,391
wearing Ninja from an 1880s movie or as
flamboyant as big gay Al Big Al in south

7
00:00:36,801 --> 00:00:40,880
park or as sleek as a black panther
in the Amazon on the hunt? Well,

8
00:00:40,881 --> 00:00:44,970
there's great news because I've been
testing this product that you wrap around

9
00:00:44,971 --> 00:00:48,360
your genitals and it makes you feel
like a superhero and it is called

10
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:49,200
[inaudible].

11
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,770
I've spent the last two to three weeks
traveling with underwear from these guys

12
00:00:52,771 --> 00:00:55,080
and they are comfy.
I got to tell you,

13
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,730
it feels like a Geisha has giving your
groin a hug and it's not just for dudes.

14
00:00:59,731 --> 00:01:04,410
But if you go to [inaudible] dot com

00:01:04,411 --> 00:01:06,420
I e s.com,
forward slash Tim,

16
00:01:06,421 --> 00:01:09,270
you can see all of the underwear
that I've been wearing.

17
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:14,190
There's some pretty ridiculous ones. And,
uh, I will also highlight my favorite,

18
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,750
you'll probably be able
to guess which it is.

19
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,380
These underwear made from micro model,

20
00:01:18,381 --> 00:01:22,740
which is extruded from Austrian
beechwood trees in the Alps. Yes. Fancy.

21
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,540
And it's two times softer than cotton,

22
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,920
scientifically tested using the collar
bottom method developed in Kyoto.

23
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:33,120
And you know, those Japanese very
crafty. And, uh, I will say a few things.

24
00:01:33,121 --> 00:01:35,970
Number one, if you go to [inaudible]
dot com forward slash Tim,

25
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,510
you get to see all of these spectacular
underwear that I've been wearing and I

26
00:01:39,511 --> 00:01:43,890
am a bit of an underwear connoisseur,
socks, fashion, sense with sweat pants,

27
00:01:43,891 --> 00:01:46,710
not so much underwear. I
understand. So check them out.

28
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:49,260
And if you go to [inaudible]

29
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:53,850
you will also be able to see lots
of hot ladies wearing me undies,

30
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,020
female underwear.

31
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:58,860
And that's just a lot of goodness for
both the men and the women out there.

32
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,860
So check it out.
[inaudible] dot com forward slash Tim,

33
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:03,930
I love these underwear and a,

34
00:02:03,931 --> 00:02:08,310
I'm going to be packing tonight probably
six to 12 pair to take with me to

35
00:02:08,311 --> 00:02:12,420
Australia. They're great. Check them out.

00:02:18,901 --> 00:02:20,490
graphic design related.

38
00:02:20,491 --> 00:02:25,491
I've used 99 designs for everything
from banner ads to book covers including

39
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:29,190
sketches and mock ups that
led to the four hour body,

40
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:33,180
which later became number one New York
Times Number One Wall Street Journal and

41
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:34,021
the brainstorming.

42
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:37,350
A lot of it took place with designers
from around the world and here's how it

43
00:02:37,351 --> 00:02:41,550
works. Whether you need a t
shirt, a business card, a website,

44
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,130
an APP thumbnail,
whatever it might be,

45
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:47,880
you submit that project and
designers from around the world.

46
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,520
We'll send you sketches
and mock ups and designs.

47
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,180
You choose your favorite and you have an
original that you love or you get your

48
00:02:54,181 --> 00:02:55,890
money back.
It's that straight forward.

49
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,590
And many of you who are listening have
already used it and created some amazing

50
00:02:59,591 --> 00:03:01,990
things that I'll be sharing in the future.
But in the meantime,

55
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,530
this is Tim Ferriss and welcome to
another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show,

56
00:03:20,531 --> 00:03:25,150
ladies and germs where it as my job to
deconstruct world class performers to

57
00:03:25,151 --> 00:03:27,550
tease out the habits,
routines, influences,

58
00:03:27,551 --> 00:03:32,020
et cetera that you can apply
to your life and those experts.

59
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:37,050
The world class performance range from
hedge fund managers to actors like Arnold

60
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:37,300
Schwarzenegger,

61
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:42,250
to people like General Stanley McChrystal
to chess prodigies and everyone in

62
00:03:42,251 --> 00:03:46,000
between.
And in this case we have a business icon,

63
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,290
none other than the oracle of
Silicon Valley. That's Reid Hoffman.

64
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:55,540
He's referred to as the Oracle Silicon
Valley by a lot of tech insiders who look

65
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:58,960
at his company building and investing
track record, which includes for instance,

66
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:03,190
well of course paypal, linkedin,
but then Facebook, airbnb,

67
00:04:03,191 --> 00:04:06,610
flicker and on and on
with awe and rightly so.

68
00:04:06,611 --> 00:04:09,010
Read is co founder and
executive chairman of Linkedin,

69
00:04:09,011 --> 00:04:11,440
which has more than the 300 million users.

70
00:04:11,441 --> 00:04:15,790
Before that he was executive vice
president at paypal which was purchased by

71
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:18,340
Ebay for one point $5 billion.

72
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:23,341
There he was nicknamed firefighter in
chief by the CEO who is Peter Teal who's

73
00:04:24,011 --> 00:04:27,940
also been on this podcast noted venture
capitalists. David Z says of Reed.

74
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:33,060
He is arguably the most successful angel
investor in the last decade or past

75
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,280
decade and they're both now
partners at Greylock partners.

76
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:41,380
He has a track record to envy and in
this podcast he is joined by a friend.

77
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:42,900
He's joined by Michael McCollough,

78
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:47,860
MD who's also co founder
of questbridge.org and a
successful investor of his own

79
00:04:47,861 --> 00:04:50,590
right with training as an er physician.

80
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:55,740
Michael is political professor at UCF
and previously served as the on call er

81
00:04:55,811 --> 00:04:59,050
physician for the Dalai Lama.
Michael is also a road scholar,

82
00:04:59,051 --> 00:05:00,970
Kauffman fellow and a showcase a fellow.

83
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,330
He is an avid meditator and is
particularly interested in investing in

84
00:05:04,331 --> 00:05:06,670
technologies and companies
pertaining to the mind.

85
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,830
So we bounced around a
lot in this conversation.

86
00:05:08,831 --> 00:05:13,420
We covered a ton including how Reid met
Mark Zuckerberg for the first time and

87
00:05:13,421 --> 00:05:14,920
how he decided to invest in Facebook,

88
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:19,930
lots behind that firefighting and started
beyond using board games to develop

89
00:05:19,931 --> 00:05:23,950
strategy reads view of what Uber has done
well and what they could improve upon.

90
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,770
Some of read suggested
philosophers for entrepreneurs,

91
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:30,940
we talk about going off algorithm per
se in the Er to manage life and death

92
00:05:30,941 --> 00:05:35,140
decisions, the three types of Ceos and
much, much more. It is a very dense,

93
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:40,420
intense and useful episode and of course
we discuss questbridge as reading and I

94
00:05:40,421 --> 00:05:43,960
are both on the advisory board.
Questbridge guys have to check it out.

95
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:48,340
[inaudible] dot org currently supplies
more exceptional low income talent,

96
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:52,630
meaning kids to top universities
than all other nonprofits combined.

97
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:56,680
Questbridge has created a single
standardized college application that's

98
00:05:56,681 --> 00:06:00,900
accepted by 36 or so top universities
like Stanford, MIT, Amherst and Yale.

99
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:03,080
This allows them to do some very,

100
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:08,060
very clever and innovative things such
as giveaway laptops and the giveaway

101
00:06:08,061 --> 00:06:10,340
forms,
double his college applications.

102
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:14,300
This offers scholarships to many kids
who might otherwise not even think of

103
00:06:14,301 --> 00:06:16,550
college. So if you want to
break the cycle of poverty,

104
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,220
questbridge is easily one
of the most fascinating,

105
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,100
effective and highly leveraged tools
I've ever seen. So check it out.

106
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:25,070
[inaudible] dot org we
will talk more about that.

107
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:27,230
So please check out the show notes.

108
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,690
There are a lot of cool
show notes for this episode,

109
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,060

everything that we talk about.

113
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,280
So without further ado,

114
00:06:43,281 --> 00:06:46,940
please enjoy this conversation
with the Oracle Silicon Valley,

115
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,640
Reid Hoffman and Michael McCullough

116
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:57,690
read. Michael, welcome to the show. Great
to be here. Thank you for having us, Tim.

117
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:58,670
I'm thrilled.

118
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:03,620
I'm really excited to have you guys on
and I know you've both known each other

119
00:07:03,621 --> 00:07:06,610
for some time and I was thinking
about the commonalities that,

120
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,530
that you might have the
common threads and uh, we'll,

121
00:07:09,531 --> 00:07:13,670
we'll certainly come back to this,
but I had heard Peter Teal had said,

122
00:07:13,671 --> 00:07:17,360
have you read that you are the
firefighter in chief at paypal?

123
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,340
And I think that,
uh,

124
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:23,780
Michael certainly based on
our conversations at least
certainly is exhibited

125
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,900
tremendous firefighting qualities.
So we'll come back to that.

126
00:07:26,901 --> 00:07:31,730
But I thought we could begin with
just some basic context for folks and,

127
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:35,540
uh, repress. We could start with you.
When people ask you the question,

128
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:37,580
what do you do?
How do you answer that?

129
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:40,810
Well, there's a short
answer and the long answer,

130
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:43,840
the short answer is I'm an
entrepreneur and investor.

131
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:46,530
That's what I want to be very quick
and move through the question.

132
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:51,550
The long answer is I essentially a build
design and improve human ecosystems

133
00:07:53,591 --> 00:07:58,210
through software, either
as a creator or as a, uh,

134
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:02,830
an ester and partner. And what that
means is everything from, you know,

135
00:08:02,831 --> 00:08:06,520
things like paypal to Linkedin,
to airbnb.

136
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:11,440
Each of these things are ways that
you craft how people find each other,

137
00:08:11,441 --> 00:08:12,850
how they interact with each other,

138
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,510
how they establish their identity and
how they make progress in their lives.

139
00:08:16,511 --> 00:08:20,680
And that's part of what I mean by
building and improving human ecosystems.

140
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:26,020
I love it. Uh, Michael, what, what
about yourself? You, you wear many hats,

141
00:08:26,021 --> 00:08:27,360
but how would you answer that question and

142
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,140
these days? Yeah, I'd say it's probably
pretty similar. I'm, I'm uh, uh,

143
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,050
I create and I help people
create things, uh, uh,

144
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,610
entrepreneurial investor as well.

145
00:08:36,611 --> 00:08:41,611
But I'm an er physician by training
and actually began my life in,

146
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:46,690
in reverse from most people kind of
creating a non profits actually first.

147
00:08:46,691 --> 00:08:50,950
So I made eight nonprofits
before my first accompany,

148
00:08:50,951 --> 00:08:54,160
including like angel investments and
things like, you know, heartflow and such.

149
00:08:54,161 --> 00:08:57,600
And I'm, uh, currently a partner at,
I can remember going to healthcare

150
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:03,340
and, uh, that's, uh, I'd love to bridge
just on the medical side of things.

151
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,430
Uh, Michael, you'd a very, uh,

152
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:11,310
difficult beginning so to speak. And
that is going way back to birth. I was,

153
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:16,000
I was hoping you could just give us a
brief description of your experience at

154
00:09:16,001 --> 00:09:17,680
birth.
Sure.

155
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,640
It's interesting how sometimes small
little slips from like an intern or like a

156
00:09:21,641 --> 00:09:26,230
resident can alter your life. Where I
was eight weeks premature, uh, with,

157
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,680
uh, uh, twin birth. And, um,

158
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,690
basically it's a little too hard on my
head and it hemorrhage and it was missed

159
00:09:31,691 --> 00:09:35,980
for nine years, so I couldn't speak
much until I was about in high school.

160
00:09:35,981 --> 00:09:39,340
I couldn't speak as fluent as I
am now till I was in my thirties.

161
00:09:39,341 --> 00:09:42,850
And even even like right now I have it
like a speech impediment device kind of

162
00:09:42,851 --> 00:09:46,000
like they have in the king's
s uh, uh, speech movie,

163
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:51,190
always speak in accents if I need
to speak more fluently. Uh, so, uh,

164
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:54,340
for me I learned how like watch people
a lot when I was younger cause it was

165
00:09:54,341 --> 00:09:56,050
harder for me to interact
with them kind of properly.

166
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:01,040
Got It. And, uh, the as, as the lines, uh,

167
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:05,360
for both of you started converging
and, uh, but before you met Reid,

168
00:10:05,361 --> 00:10:10,250
you went to, as I understand
it, a somewhat unconventional
high school in Vermont,

169
00:10:10,251 --> 00:10:14,330
I think it was the Putney school where
you farm to Maple Syrup and drove oxen.

170
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,680
Uh, what did you, what did you take from
that experience that stuck with you,

171
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:19,820
if anything?

172
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:25,050
Well, I was actually a, uh, at
the time, you know, it's funny,

173
00:10:25,051 --> 00:10:26,610
it's kind of was your older,

174
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,500
each decade you look back on your life
and you actually in fact have a different

175
00:10:31,501 --> 00:10:35,670
view of your early decades.
So if you'd asked me 10, 20
years ago, it's like, well,

176
00:10:35,671 --> 00:10:36,870
it's completely off track.

177
00:10:36,871 --> 00:10:41,120
I've become a technologist
and entrepreneur or none of
that stuff was actually a

178
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,520
directly relevant to now when I kind
of look back at it. And I said, well,

179
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:48,750
actually in fact it was very
grounding. Um, I had experiences,

180
00:10:48,751 --> 00:10:53,190
there are everything from black smithing
to actually a bunch of artistic things.

181
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:55,370
Um, I had, you know,

182
00:10:55,380 --> 00:11:00,120
kind of some intensity around cross
country speed skiing and sports and all of

183
00:11:00,121 --> 00:11:05,121
that actually I think helped me
understand the breadth of human condition.

184
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:10,240
You know, typically, um, silicon
valley entrepreneurs and,

185
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:13,560
and, and, uh, investors and,

186
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:16,470
and technologists tend
to be very narrow focus.

187
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:20,700
And I actually think it's helped
me keep a broader focus, uh,

188
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:25,080
as I think about kind of what it is
to be human and how do we increase our

189
00:11:25,081 --> 00:11:25,914
humanity.

190
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,940
And I might be skipping
ahead a little bit,

191
00:11:28,941 --> 00:11:33,740
but do you have then a
sympathetic ear for say,

192
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:38,910
nontechnical founders who come in without
technical chops a or how do you look

193
00:11:40,251 --> 00:11:41,084
at that?

194
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,930
Well, so I um, it depends
on the project. Um,

195
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,110
some pro or depth of technology.

196
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,610
Usually when I talked to a non technical
founder who wants to create something,

197
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:52,630
I,

198
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:57,310
the very second and third piece of
advice I give them is to find a technical

199
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,350
cofounder. Uh, because you know, it's not,
you know, it's not so easy to just say,

200
00:12:02,351 --> 00:12:02,531
oh,

201
00:12:02,531 --> 00:12:06,790
well I'm going to hire some engineers
and some remote location to build the APP

202
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:10,780
that I think of because actually in fact,
you have to be much more detailed,

203
00:12:10,781 --> 00:12:12,970
much more specific
about how it's evolving.

204
00:12:12,971 --> 00:12:17,790
And so if you're building technology
and you don't at least have a, uh,

205
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:22,510
a good tech technical cofounder, you
have a problem. Now that being said,

206
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:26,290
there's a number of,
of businesses that, um,

207
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:29,170
the technology is only one compete.
It's an important piece,

208
00:12:29,171 --> 00:12:33,400
but it's only one piece. Like airbnb for
example. You know, Nate's very technical,

209
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:39,190
but Brian and Joe, our design
folks, their product folks,

210
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:42,380
there are folks, um, they
both, you know, kind of, uh,

211
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,440
coming out of [inaudible] and so,

212
00:12:44,441 --> 00:12:47,920
and actually that helps fundamentally
with the airbnb product.

213
00:12:47,921 --> 00:12:50,040
And so it isn't that you then,

214
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:52,360
it isn't that everybody in a
founding team has to be technical,

215
00:12:52,361 --> 00:12:55,120
but if you're doing the technology thing,
at least one of you does.

216
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,510
Right. No, that makes perfect sense.

217
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,750
Where did philosophy
enter the picture for you?

218
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:04,710
Because I know a lot of people in
Silicon Valley think of you in part as a

219
00:13:04,711 --> 00:13:08,310
philosopher, a at least a
thinker along those lines. Ha.

220
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,590
How did you become interested
in philosophy and why?

221
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,870
Well, it's funny actually and very, uh,

222
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,280
I'd say one of the small
critiques of Silicon Valley is it,

223
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:19,980
this may actually speak more to you
than the people of Silicon Valley.

224
00:13:19,981 --> 00:13:22,740
A very few people in Silicon Valley
interface with me as a philosopher.

225
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:26,970
It takes up another thinker, like you
would actually ask that question. But, um,

226
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,630
the way that I got to it is I did my
undergraduate at Stanford University in,

227
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:36,600
along with Michael and, um,
my undergraduate degree was
called symbolic systems,

228
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:40,830
which is in short speak cognitive
science and artificial intelligence.

229
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,500
And,
uh,

230
00:13:42,501 --> 00:13:45,750
I've always actually been very interested
in kind of what makes us uniquely

231
00:13:45,751 --> 00:13:47,820
human and, and, uh,

232
00:13:47,821 --> 00:13:52,350
and that's continued throughout my
entire arc of my career in childhood.

233
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:56,190
And so then it was like the scientific
study of, of thought and language.

234
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:00,540
But then what I realized when I was
at Stanford is that actually in fact,

235
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,840
even though we were trying
to be scientific about what
it is to be intelligent

236
00:14:03,841 --> 00:14:07,440
about what it is to communicate about
what it is to have a point of view on the

237
00:14:07,441 --> 00:14:12,200
world, um, the science hadn't
really gotten there yet.
And actually in fact, uh,

238
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:16,000
I should experiment with
philosophy to figure out the,

239
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,540
the whether or not the,
the,

240
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:22,380
the rudiments of understanding these
things I could get out of philosophy in

241
00:14:22,381 --> 00:14:26,940
order to pursue a more
scientific view of intelligence.

242
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:29,870
And so, uh, because the modern analytics,

243
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:32,490
a view on philosophy is it's pre science.

244
00:14:32,491 --> 00:14:36,090
It's like how you think about
things with precision. Uh, uh,

245
00:14:36,091 --> 00:14:40,800
and then science births out of philosophy.
And so I went to Oxford in order to,

246
00:14:40,801 --> 00:14:41,790
uh,
study philosophy.

247
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:48,130
Are you currently drawn to any particular
schools of philosophy or philosophers

248
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,020
in the context,

249
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:55,640
say recommending someone who has never
been exposed to philosophy or fuels that

250
00:14:55,641 --> 00:14:59,750
they haven't? Uh, what, what
starting points might you suggest?

251
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:05,240
Well, one of the things that
I, uh, the papers that I
read at, cause it's a, you'd,

252
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:10,210
when you do a course, you read a subject,
one of them was that can shine. And so,

253
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,660
uh, one of the things I
actually frequently, uh,

254
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:18,220
refer people to when they're thinking
about kind of how do we think of ourselves

255
00:15:18,221 --> 00:15:19,930
as, as, as,

256
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:24,130
as sharing a world as talking to each
other about it as understanding it.

257
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,230
A matter of fact,
I recently,

258
00:15:26,231 --> 00:15:30,950
when I was explaining a theory on Bitcoin,
uh,

259
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:35,170
to some fellow technologist, I said, look,
it's like a can Justinian language game,

260
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,840
right? That the notion of how you
play it. And they're like, okay,

261
00:15:37,841 --> 00:15:39,010
how do I understand that? I'm like, okay,

262
00:15:39,011 --> 00:15:42,100
well here's some good books on Vic can
shine and here's a couple of points.

263
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,500
Right? Um, but it is,

264
00:15:44,501 --> 00:15:49,180
that would be the one that
I would probably start with
just because I think he

265
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:52,120
is one of the, you know, um,

266
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:57,540
one of the fundamental philosophers who
is still being understood because the,

267
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:58,980
the, the, the,

268
00:15:58,981 --> 00:16:03,820
the kind of one of the bedrocks of modern
analytic philosophy is to think of of

269
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:09,210
if you're trying to talk to someone else
about some problem and you trying to

270
00:16:09,431 --> 00:16:10,300
make progress,

271
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:15,190
how do you make language as
positive and instrument as possible?

272
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:18,820
And what are the ways that language can
work and what are the ways that language

273
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:21,910
doesn't work? And so for
example, on that, on that thread,

274
00:16:21,911 --> 00:16:23,440
when I wrote my thesis in Oxford,

275
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:28,800
it was on thought experiments because
most philosophers actually in fact analyze

276
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:31,210
and argue through thought experiments.

277
00:16:31,211 --> 00:16:34,000
And there's actually more
limitations in the methodology then,

278
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:35,890
at least many belief.

279
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,290
No, it's, it's uh,

280
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:42,780
I find language just an
endlessly fascinating topic
because you, you'll find,

281
00:16:42,781 --> 00:16:43,950
I mean,
silicon valley and elsewhere,

282
00:16:43,951 --> 00:16:48,840
people will debate say the existence
of God without ever defining, uh,

283
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:51,990
what God is for each of
the parties involved.

284
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:56,130
So Michael, well, you
and I have spoken about,

285
00:16:57,210 --> 00:17:01,790
I suppose philosophical topics a
lot about meditation. Uh, and, uh,

286
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:06,540
I think people gravitate towards say
religion or philosophy respectively to too

287
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:10,020
often face the prospect
of death or mortality.

288
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:15,700
I would love you to
elaborate if you could, uh,

289
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:20,780
about going off algorithm in the Er and
what that means because I've had some

290
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:24,810
fascinating conversations with you about
this and I was hoping you might be able

291
00:17:24,811 --> 00:17:29,490
to just explain that and give a few
examples. Sure. Well, I, I think,

292
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:32,000
I think algorithms
protect a lot of people,

293
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,620
particularly from,
um,

294
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:39,340
if physicians aren't being fully
attentive or on top of all the literature,

295
00:17:40,911 --> 00:17:45,911
but in within a bell curve there that
might be ways to save people or even

296
00:17:47,391 --> 00:17:51,540
improve people's lives that, that in kind
of the standard operating procedures.

297
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:56,000
So like I had a patient one time who
came in with headed to a burns and,

298
00:17:56,001 --> 00:18:00,230
and you can look at him and you would
know once you intubate him and have him in

299
00:18:00,231 --> 00:18:03,150
the ICU, he, he wouldn't
possibly actually wake up again.

300
00:18:03,151 --> 00:18:05,670
But he was lucid enough and I thought,
you know,

301
00:18:05,671 --> 00:18:08,220
I don't want to call a few people
before I had to go to sleep.

302
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:12,600
So I gave him my cell phone to
you as much to their chagrin of,

303
00:18:12,601 --> 00:18:15,450
and the people in the room,
um,

304
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:19,080
better make a few calls.
But even even there,

305
00:18:19,081 --> 00:18:23,970
like I had to stop them from making
additional calls but he got to call a few

306
00:18:23,971 --> 00:18:27,250
people. Uh, he had begun
to swell as airway shirt,

307
00:18:27,251 --> 00:18:31,250
so I had to make sure I could
intubate on kind of the first try or,

308
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:33,540
or a pub would have lost my job.
But um,

309
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,170
and by intubate you may get a
tube down his trachea. Yeah,

310
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,920
completely closed. Yeah. Cause if you in

311
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:44,610
inhale hot air, then you're,
the, the soft tissue in,

312
00:18:44,611 --> 00:18:47,960
in your kind of, your mouth will swell
up and you won't be able to breathe.

313
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:49,580
Now in, in, in his case,

314
00:18:49,581 --> 00:18:54,110
it didn't change outcome that much cause
he was either going to a die in the er

315
00:18:54,111 --> 00:18:58,850
or in the ICU. So, so I thought
enabling him to make kind of a human,

316
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,530
a connection ahead of the ICU would be,
would be helpful.

317
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:06,670
And now in,
in uh,

318
00:19:06,671 --> 00:19:10,240
in your experience then
when you look at the,

319
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,680
let's just define maybe the use of
the word algorithm. So is it, is it,

320
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:18,610
is it fair to say that in this context
one could think of an algorithm as a

321
00:19:18,611 --> 00:19:23,350
mandatory checklist, which also
excludes certain options? Yeah,

322
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:27,770
I think a few, and I think a tool,
a guanine work and other shows,

323
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:32,980
a checklist is profoundly helpful.
Checklist Manifesto. Yeah,

324
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:34,480
it's really good book.
And,

325
00:19:34,481 --> 00:19:38,990
and even things like washing your hands
between patients with things as simple

326
00:19:38,991 --> 00:19:42,140
as that will save water lives.
However,

327
00:19:42,141 --> 00:19:45,500
sometimes you do know everything on the
checklist and sometimes there are things

328
00:19:45,501 --> 00:19:49,940
you can do that aren't on the checklist
that actually ought to be done. So, um,

329
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,290
example was also that,
um,

330
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:58,040
I had a patient who,
um,

331
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:04,240
in our ear or they have a policy of
making sure they call their donor network

332
00:20:04,461 --> 00:20:08,360
after the patients actually passed away
to see if they can with the permission

333
00:20:08,361 --> 00:20:13,310
of the family and the, to the
patient, um, help with us,

334
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:18,080
uh, skin transportation or like a cornea.

335
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,810
But they became confused to think,
well,

336
00:20:20,811 --> 00:20:24,950
that means you then you shouldn't call
earlier to talk about the heart or the

337
00:20:24,951 --> 00:20:27,710
liver and things like that.
So in that particular case,

338
00:20:27,711 --> 00:20:32,010
in an algorithm or a policy, actually, um,

339
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:37,840
make people not appreciate
the more important organs
to kind of think about too.

340
00:20:39,111 --> 00:20:42,110
So, uh, have answered your, uh,

341
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,740
no, no, you have and I just,

342
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,060
when we've had dinner before and um,

343
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:53,030
I'd love for you to describe if you could,
and it's a,

344
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:56,890
it was, it was fascinating for me to
hear and your, your description of this,

345
00:20:56,891 --> 00:21:01,090
but what is it like to,
and I know we're bouncing around a bit,

346
00:21:01,091 --> 00:21:05,650
but to stare into someone's eyes or to
look into their eyes as they pass from

347
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:08,800
alive, not alive. Maybe

348
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,650
having that happen a few times.

349
00:21:12,651 --> 00:21:15,820
And it's interesting cause it often
depends on the emotional state of,

350
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:19,670
of the patient, right? So
if the patient is afraid

351
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:24,030
you're trying to give comfort
to them is they're dying and,

352
00:21:24,031 --> 00:21:28,710
and other times patients die and they're
giving you a sense of peace and kind of

353
00:21:28,711 --> 00:21:32,610
universality that that would be hard to,
uh,

354
00:21:32,611 --> 00:21:36,700
pay for kind of a depth of understanding
that they are dying and you know,

355
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,950
this is kind of the moment of
their death. And so, um, it,

356
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:44,910
it's an honor to be there or either way
to either like witness it happening from

357
00:21:44,911 --> 00:21:49,911
a person who is a content with it or
to comfort and hope the hand of someone

358
00:21:50,101 --> 00:21:50,934
who's not.

359
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:55,230
And uh, in that type of
context or just in general,

360
00:21:55,231 --> 00:22:00,231
what in your mind separates a good er
physician from a great er physician?

361
00:22:01,381 --> 00:22:06,290
What are the great people have, do or
not do that the, that the good, uh,

362
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:07,163
lack,

363
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:12,410
yeah, I think a good or for this
and it's thorough. You know,

364
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,440
they make sure they don't like needlessly
missed anything. We're not like,

365
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:19,680
you know, wash their hands
between the patients. I think, um,

366
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,540
if you are layer on to that and that
you actually care about the patient,

367
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:28,460
you know, you, you like to like
laugh could be alcoholic or to make,

368
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,313
um,

369
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:34,820
or to help the dorm in the first trimester
of her pregnancy feel comfort that

370
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:39,320
she is, you, you're likely
not to lose her child.

371
00:22:39,321 --> 00:22:40,370
But even if she does,

372
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:44,780
it wouldn't interfere with her being
able to get pregnant in the future again.

373
00:22:44,781 --> 00:22:48,350
And so you could either pay
attention to say the odds that,

374
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:53,590
that she'd lose this particular pregnancy
or to make sure to reassure her what

375
00:22:53,871 --> 00:22:56,780
she's actually worried about is, you
know, will I ever have an infant,

376
00:22:56,781 --> 00:23:01,150
will ever have a family?
And I think, um, like,

377
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:05,840
like a lot of people don't know that a
third of all pregnancies are actually

378
00:23:05,841 --> 00:23:08,000
lost.
And that's normal for humans.

379
00:23:08,001 --> 00:23:11,780
Every animal has like a normal
weight of like losing one.

380
00:23:11,781 --> 00:23:16,490
And that's a known a pregnancy.
So it's lacking more like half.

381
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:21,470
And yet, since we no longer live
in a tribes with other people,

382
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:25,010
we hide the fact of losing an
infant in the first trimester.

383
00:23:25,011 --> 00:23:29,360
So if you don't take the extra
time to a comfort people,

384
00:23:29,361 --> 00:23:33,680
sometimes they think they're
normal when they actually are not.

385
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:34,843
Right.

386
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,180
No,
that makes perfect sense.

387
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:39,870
I don't think that applies to therapy
of all different types. I mean,

388
00:23:39,871 --> 00:23:44,810
outside of the context of
an emergency room, the uh,

389
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:49,210
the firefighting that I
mentioned earlier, uh, read it.

390
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:54,200
My understanding was that you had, you
were many, many different hats and uh,

391
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:55,540
had the,
the,

392
00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:00,170
the role of interacting with a lot
of external entities when at paypal,

393
00:24:00,171 --> 00:24:03,770
whether that was regulatory
or the credit card processors,

394
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,070
maybe that's not the right
description of them, but, uh,

395
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:12,160
what makes a good entrepreneurial
firefighter in a context like that?

396
00:24:12,381 --> 00:24:16,610
Or what, what did your coworkers
feel made you good at that?

397
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:18,590
Well,

398
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:23,180
the most to relevant
factors where Peter Teal,

399
00:24:23,181 --> 00:24:27,920
who was the CEO feeling when I was
good and solving the problems, uh,

400
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:32,540
everything else was, was a secondary
to those two considerations.

401
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:37,140
I mean the, um, on the firefighting
side, I mean, paypal had, uh,

402
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,130
perhaps the most,
um,

403
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:44,840
the most kind of a parallel thing to,

404
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:48,380
you know, to date myself a little
bit like a star wars, you know,

405
00:24:48,381 --> 00:24:52,250
flying into the trench and trying to
actually hit the target and a lot of

406
00:24:52,251 --> 00:24:57,110
different ways you could, you
could fail. And, and so in, in,

407
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:01,580
in the paypal case, for
me, a lot of that was,

408
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,310
um,
uh,

409
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:08,620
building an understanding of what
each particular problem particularly

410
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:10,701
throughout was,

411
00:25:10,701 --> 00:25:15,701
what the key moving a variable was and
then being able to solve that and then

412
00:25:17,901 --> 00:25:22,580
propagate that out to all of the places.
So, you know, for example, one of the,

413
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:27,560
um, the kind of challenges
that Peter handed to me was,

414
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,890
um, we had thought that
paypal might be a bank.

415
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:34,760
And so we had started the process
of applying for a banking license.

416
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:40,390
Then what we discovered and decided upon
inference was that actually in fact,

417
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:46,730
banking regulation is so fierce
in terms of not innovating,

418
00:25:46,731 --> 00:25:48,020
not building new things.

419
00:25:48,021 --> 00:25:51,230
It would be very difficult to
build a new company on that basis.

420
00:25:51,231 --> 00:25:55,910
So I essentially had to move to,
um,

421
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,060
to go persuade the
regulators that it was okay.

422
00:25:59,061 --> 00:26:03,530
That even though we had applied
for a banking license, right,

423
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:04,970
uh,
that we,

424
00:26:04,971 --> 00:26:08,840
it was okay that we were not going to
be a bank and that and that it wasn't a

425
00:26:08,841 --> 00:26:11,870
tell that was we'll just inconvenient
for us or anything else. And,

426
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,410
and to give to full
color to this, the, the,

427
00:26:15,411 --> 00:26:18,050
the basic statement about
whether or not a, a,

428
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:21,890
a company as a bank starts with the claim.

429
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:27,200
You accept deposits, which obviously
if anyone has, has exposure to paypal,

430
00:26:27,201 --> 00:26:31,520
they said, well, you could frame what
paypal does as accepting deposits,

431
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,970
right? You know, uh, why
is it you're not a bank?

432
00:26:34,971 --> 00:26:38,330
And so that would be the kind of
challenge, uh, that was handed to me.

433
00:26:38,331 --> 00:26:42,930
And then what you had to do is you
had to figure out for this, uh,

434
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:47,070
problem, which could kill the company.
What were the key moving variables,

435
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:47,970
learn them,

436
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:53,090
talk to really smart people and then
solve that problem so that it was then

437
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,970
fundamentally part of the
cornerstone of what you are doing. A,

438
00:26:56,971 --> 00:27:01,590
and it ranged from relationship
with Ebay to visa and mastercard to

439
00:27:01,591 --> 00:27:06,480
international. Right. And we just,
uh, just a very long list of things.

440
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:10,650
And um, and each one, the, the, the, the,

441
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,320
the looking at the problem
had to be reframed.

442
00:27:13,321 --> 00:27:16,680
It was almost like building a kind of a,
a view of the world.

443
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:19,680
And then what are the key moving parts
in order to get right in order to make

444
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:20,514
people succeed.

445
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,540
And when you were defining
the moving variables, uh,

446
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:30,740
is that a list of the unknowns that where
you need to go seek out information or

447
00:27:30,931 --> 00:27:33,230
is it, uh, how,

448
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:37,230
how would you go about putting
together that list? Well,

449
00:27:37,231 --> 00:27:39,180
it kind of starts with a,

450
00:27:39,181 --> 00:27:43,530
what is the end result that you
want to have happen? So for example,

451
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:48,930
uh, and, uh, like in regulatory
one, the key thing is that,

452
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,080
uh, you can't, regulators will
never tell you that they can't,

453
00:27:52,081 --> 00:27:55,830
that that is not their job to regulate
you because there's no interest on that

454
00:27:55,831 --> 00:27:59,100
for that. Well, they will simply
do is say, oh, actually, in fact,

455
00:27:59,101 --> 00:28:03,060
there's nothing for me here to actively
regulate. They won't tell you, I won't,

456
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:06,450
you know, you're outside of my
scope. They'll go, ah, okay, fine.

457
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,030
You now seem like you're an okay.

458
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:13,340
Like I don't need to actually regulate
you because you're not in my positive

459
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,430
probate. And so you say, okay,

460
00:28:14,431 --> 00:28:18,240
how did you get that state of affairs
and how do you propagate that?

461
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:21,180
And then you start working
back from that to say, okay,

462
00:28:21,181 --> 00:28:25,440
well how would they make their judgments?
What are their key considerations? Uh,

463
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:27,630
how can I learn about that?
Who would I need to know?

464
00:28:27,631 --> 00:28:30,550
Cause those were some of
the unknowns come in. Uh,

465
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:34,770
what are the kinds of things
that would get them to say, okay,

466
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,800
uh, you're, you're, you're, uh,

467
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:41,550
I think you're being reasonable
and within my per view of how,

468
00:28:41,551 --> 00:28:46,230
of how I am out to help govern society,
help tech to consumers,

469
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:51,270
uh, help protect other entities.
Uh, you're good by me and that,

470
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:54,750
and then you, then you work back from that
is the, essentially the way you do it.

471
00:28:55,050 --> 00:29:00,050
And how did you learn how to do that?

472
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:04,470
Uh, were, were you part of a debate
team? You studied negotiation?

473
00:29:04,471 --> 00:29:07,950
Did you work at a State Fair
for the summers? I mean,

474
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:09,410
how did you develop the ability to,

475
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:12,570
the ability to not only
deconstruct a problem like that,

476
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:17,660
but then to interface with all these
various stakeholders at the table?

477
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:22,980
I think the most fundamental was
I, uh, I dunno if, if you're,

478
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,380
uh, audience, uh, knows what this is a,

479
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:30,770
you probably do as a child,
I played a lot of Avalon hill board games.

480
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:31,920
Uh,

481
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:36,920
and each board game is actually a
complex set of rules and circumstances.

482
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,800
And essentially as you're analyzing each
one of them, you kind of look back from,

483
00:29:41,801 --> 00:29:42,101
okay,

484
00:29:42,101 --> 00:29:46,210
these goals mean that these are the kinds
of moving parts and how do you do it?

485
00:29:46,211 --> 00:29:51,211
So it was actually in fact my childhood
gaming for being able to build a model

486
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:55,900
of what a game was.
That was the,

487
00:29:56,020 --> 00:30:00,460
essentially the fundamental thing that
informs, you know, my strategic sense.

488
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:02,620
Um,
because this all comes out of strategy.

489
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:03,921
And if,

490
00:30:03,921 --> 00:30:08,921
if you were giving advice to say someone
leaving Stanford Undergrad and they

491
00:30:09,551 --> 00:30:12,940
had, they had no gaming
background, how might,

492
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:18,000
what would you recommend they do to
try to develop a strategic ability?

493
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:19,773
We're thinking,

494
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:24,810
well, um, you know, there's a
lot of different paths to it.

495
00:30:24,811 --> 00:30:28,950
Most people think they're better
at strategy than they are. Um,

496
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:33,060
and so you really have to actually
really hold up a very clear,

497
00:30:33,061 --> 00:30:37,440
you have to have a very
deep self awareness of am I
in fact really good at it?

498
00:30:37,441 --> 00:30:40,370
Because like having an idea or
saying like for example, you said,

499
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:43,080
well I'll just do this.
Well one move,

500
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:46,920
a real strategy is actually
built up off a, you know,

501
00:30:46,921 --> 00:30:50,910
what are your competitors doing? What
is their mindset? What are their assets?

502
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:55,290
How are they going to move, how you're
going to move, what are your, uh,

503
00:30:55,291 --> 00:30:58,080
what are your edges? What's the
way that you could make that work?

504
00:30:58,081 --> 00:31:02,790
How is it when they're playing against
you, you can still play to win. Um,

505
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,800
so games are very good way to do that.

506
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:08,730
And getting a lot of different exposure
to computer games cause computer,

507
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,001
you know,

508
00:31:09,001 --> 00:31:14,001
AI strategies are usually
not that interesting but
against other people is very

509
00:31:14,401 --> 00:31:18,870
useful.
I think it's also useful to read some,

510
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:22,350
uh, which I did as a child,
you know, military strategy,

511
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:26,580
some zoo von Clausewitz, other
sorts of folks, more modern folks.

512
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:31,410
And to think about kind of like what are
the set of principles that when you're

513
00:31:31,411 --> 00:31:36,000
thinking about how to,
how to win a game that's in,

514
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:40,860
in contention in conflict. And then a
lot of people also of course have some,

515
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:44,880
um, sports knowledge on this
too. Although one of the things,

516
00:31:44,881 --> 00:31:48,370
it's frequently a little
limiting on sports is that, uh,

517
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:52,720
the sports game that a person tends to,
they tend to be like, I play soccer,

518
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,630
I played football,
I played basketball.

519
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:57,960
And then they have a very deep
sense of what the strategy is there.

520
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,930
But they haven't played enough different
kinds of games and have different

521
00:32:00,931 --> 00:32:05,700
circumstances. You know, it's um, uh,
it's like understanding like, well,

522
00:32:05,701 --> 00:32:09,510
what happens if I change these four
rules in basketball? Right, right.

523
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,920
How would you play the strategy now,
you know,

524
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,670
totally that that's the kind of
thing because actually in fact,

525
00:32:14,671 --> 00:32:18,120
most of the circumstances you find
yourself in actually, in fact,

526
00:32:18,121 --> 00:32:22,980
you have to figure out what is the
current game look like and how do you play

527
00:32:22,981 --> 00:32:25,950
that. Uh, and that's of
course also by the way,

528
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,890
the reason why frequently, um, you know,

529
00:32:28,891 --> 00:32:31,980
companies rise and fall is because
they learned to play one game,

530
00:32:31,981 --> 00:32:35,940
they got good at it and
then the marketplace changes
and now it's a new kind of

531
00:32:35,941 --> 00:32:38,850
game and you have to adjust
the playing that new game.

532
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:43,990
And that's actually in fact a part of
recognizing when a strategy applies.

533
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,080
Absolutely. Yeah, it'd been,

534
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:49,900
I was just having a conversation with
someone about the rise and fall of Codec,

535
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:53,850
um, yesterday. And of
course this is sort of the,

536
00:32:53,851 --> 00:32:58,710
the disruptive theme that one encounters
so much in silicon valley. I, um,

537
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:02,090
I, I, I wasn't planning on asking
this, but I'd be so curious to hear,

538
00:33:02,091 --> 00:33:06,100
given your experience with
regulatory risk and so on, what,

539
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,670
what do you feel,
uh,

540
00:33:07,671 --> 00:33:12,671
if you have an opinion Uber has
done well and what could they have,

541
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:17,180
uh, executed more
effectively or strategically?

542
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:23,270
So what they've done well is essentially
quickly deploying their product so that

543
00:33:23,731 --> 00:33:27,320
it's clear that there's a bunch of
people who are benefiting from it. Uh,

544
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,590
both consumers and drivers,
uh, in various circumstances.

545
00:33:31,591 --> 00:33:35,430
So that there is an ecosystem of
people by what you go look, see,

546
00:33:35,431 --> 00:33:38,760
we can actually add a lot
of positive to the system.

547
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:43,560
I think that's been kind of one of the
things that they've done most positively

548
00:33:43,561 --> 00:33:46,830
within it. On the negative side, you know,

549
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:50,880
the company tends to be
very combative and you know,

550
00:33:50,881 --> 00:33:55,370
when you actually think about the
mental space in which regulators, um,

551
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:57,090
tend to operate,

552
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:01,530
they tend to have gone into that job
because they view themselves as protectors

553
00:34:01,531 --> 00:34:03,360
of important groups in society,

554
00:34:03,361 --> 00:34:07,230
whether they're consumers
or workers or other folks.

555
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,950
And so they don't tend
to respond very well.

556
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:13,080
It's not a competitive game with them.

557
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,450
It's not you bulldoze
through them or over them.

558
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,530
They're actually in fact what what they
want is they want to know that their,

559
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:21,510
their concerns are being answered.

560
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,360
And it's frustrating of course
for the company because you know,

561
00:34:24,361 --> 00:34:29,190
the regulators are being triggered by
you know, a competitive interests like,

562
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:32,400
you know, taxi cab companies
and other kinds of things,

563
00:34:32,401 --> 00:34:35,400
which I want the world to
stay only exactly as it is,

564
00:34:35,401 --> 00:34:38,160
which is not actually good for
anyone to just say, you know,

565
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:41,280
the way that we had to run is the way
that we were running in the 1950s and

566
00:34:41,281 --> 00:34:44,010
that's the way we're going to
be running in 3000. You know,

567
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:47,280
that's obviously not a very good idea.
So actually in fact,

568
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:50,370
innovation and change and the pushback
as frustrating. But nevertheless,

569
00:34:50,371 --> 00:34:52,890
when you're interfacing
with the regulators, uh,

570
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:56,640
you have to interface with them
with the understanding that there,

571
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:59,970
that may be conservative, they may be
slow to change and maybe risk averse,

572
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,330
but their goal is a mission
of protecting society.

573
00:35:03,331 --> 00:35:08,331
And she should interface with them on
that channel more than on the just get out

574
00:35:09,781 --> 00:35:13,830
of my way. I'm innovating all right, and
treat you like I treat a competitor. Uh,

575
00:35:13,831 --> 00:35:16,410
and that's, that's, that creates
a lot of unnecessary friction.

576
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:20,960
Right. No, that makes
sense. You are of course,

577
00:35:20,961 --> 00:35:23,570
considered a company builder.
Uh,

578
00:35:23,571 --> 00:35:27,140
you've had a integral part in
building some massive successes,

579
00:35:27,141 --> 00:35:31,880
but you're also very well
regarded as an investor. And, uh,

580
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:36,110
I would love if you could tell the
story of getting introduced to mark

581
00:35:36,111 --> 00:35:38,130
Zuckerberg and how you decided to be one

582
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:40,800
of the first investors in Facebook.
Well,

583
00:35:40,801 --> 00:35:44,580
actually I could have told you I was
interested in investing in Facebook even

584
00:35:44,581 --> 00:35:48,750
before, um, Mark Zuckerberg.
I track the product.

585
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:52,980
I thought it was extremely well done.
Uh, when I tracked it, it, you know,

586
00:35:52,981 --> 00:35:57,510
he and his cofounders,
Dustin, Chris and others, uh,

587
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:01,860
or, uh, in, uh, Boston, you
know, going to Harvard. Right.

588
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,570
And so I want to ask too much about it.
I was,

589
00:36:03,571 --> 00:36:05,940
angel investing is too much of a
hassle as a venture capitalist.

590
00:36:05,941 --> 00:36:08,340
I probably would have flown out there,
but I was like, it was an angel,

591
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:11,490
too much of a hassle. And so I
kind of went, oh, that's cool.

592
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:16,520
And then went back to it and then I got
this call from Sean Parker who I'd known

593
00:36:17,071 --> 00:36:19,410
from his work at Plaxo and you know,

594
00:36:19,411 --> 00:36:24,411
it was a good product and venture and
good systems thinker on these things.

595
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:29,610
And Sean's had a, I've just met,
um, uh, these really good guys,

596
00:36:29,611 --> 00:36:29,761
you know,

597
00:36:29,761 --> 00:36:32,340
Mark Zuckerberg and others who are doing
this thing on Facebook that I'm joining.

598
00:36:32,341 --> 00:36:35,050
That's really awesome. And I'm like, oh,
that's really cool. You moving to Boston?

599
00:36:35,051 --> 00:36:38,910
And he's like, no, no, they're
here. And I'm like, oh,
that's interesting. He's like,

600
00:36:38,911 --> 00:36:40,350
yeah, and we're looking for
it. That's when I'm like,

601
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:44,280
I would definitely like to
meet with them. Um, you know,

602
00:36:44,281 --> 00:36:48,480
I'm super interested in this. Uh, I tend
to think, and one of the things I said,

603
00:36:48,481 --> 00:36:50,130
which is I think totally,
you know,

604
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,680
even though it's probably
the most expensive economic
decision I've made in my

605
00:36:52,681 --> 00:36:56,880
life, um, but it all in a good outcome.
I said, look, you know, when I did,

606
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:59,670
when I led the series a in French or a,

607
00:36:59,671 --> 00:37:03,510
I got a lot of pushback on am I
having my cake and eating it too.

608
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:06,720
Cause even though I don't see any
conflict between Friendster and Linkedin,

609
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:08,820
you know,
it just generated all this stuff.

610
00:37:08,821 --> 00:37:11,170
And part of having integrity and having,
you know,

611
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:15,510
a high sense of ethics is not just having
it but also making some work to appear

612
00:37:15,511 --> 00:37:15,931
to have it.

613
00:37:15,931 --> 00:37:20,760
So actually I think we should do is
we should have Peter a lead there.

614
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:24,960
Peter Teal lead the round and I'll follow
because then Peter can be the board

615
00:37:24,961 --> 00:37:27,510
member. And even though I'm
super interested in this,

616
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:30,600
I think that's probably the best
thing to happen. And so, um,

617
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:35,570
my actually very first meeting was
Zuckerberg was at Peter teals office, uh,

618
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:39,840
uh, with Sean there who I'd known
and with, um, with, uh, CSEC.

619
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:43,560
And then Matt Cohler was there as well.
And who was working for me at the time.

620
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:47,400
And, uh, that was our very
first meeting. But you know, uh,

621
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:50,430
basically the meeting was
very confirmatory because
they'd already seen the

622
00:37:50,431 --> 00:37:52,500
product, already know the
product, what are the amazing,

623
00:37:52,501 --> 00:37:55,590
already seen it having traction. Um, and,

624
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:00,210
and really what I learned from the, from
the meeting, which is hardly a surprise,

625
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:04,020
especially now in retrospect,
was the Zuckerberg extremely smart,

626
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:08,530
very much of a learning machine.
Uh, very good at, uh, um,

627
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:11,970
you know, the evolution of
technologies. Um, and so,

628
00:38:11,971 --> 00:38:15,240
but I'd already more or less was
positive, you know, if he'd said,

629
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:17,040
I don't want to meet with you,
but when you want to put in money,

630
00:38:17,041 --> 00:38:21,260
I probably would have put in
money anyway. Right. And, uh,

631
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:25,710
did you, what was the, what was
mark Pincus his role at that,

632
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:29,880
at that point or his involvement
with Facebook? Uh, well, it actually,

633
00:38:29,881 --> 00:38:32,400
so the way mark had also,

634
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:36,490
Pincus had also known Sean Parker
back from Napster days. Um,

635
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:40,030
uh, pig us had done a, an early
startup called freeloader.

636
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:45,600
But a part of actually how mark got
involved in the Facebook investment was

637
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:50,110
separately mark and I had bought
a patent called the six degrees.

638
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:55,110
Pat Seems has some number which describes
the viral expansion of a system.

639
00:38:56,590 --> 00:39:01,510
And, uh, and you know, again, kind
of on the, on the AEC space, this,

640
00:39:01,511 --> 00:39:03,700
I went, look, mark and
I are partners on this.

641
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:08,590
We're actually trying to protect all
these new web 2.0 viral companies.

642
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:13,030
That's our principal goal in this patent
in, in going and buying this patent.

643
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:18,310
But you know, um, uh, you know,
given that Facebook's also in this,

644
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:22,600
I should act in fact a split
the investment with mark, uh,

645
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:27,010
because, uh, you know, basically, um, uh,

646
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,950
it's part of being a good partner with
him. And so that's part of how mark now,

647
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:33,130
he also had known Shawn Parker and Shawn
had talked to him about it as well.

648
00:39:33,131 --> 00:39:34,690
So there's,
there's a bunch of different things,

649
00:39:34,691 --> 00:39:37,660
but that's fundamentally
how pink is also became a,

650
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:39,790
a series a investor in Facebook.

651
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:45,190
Got It. And on the, on
the, um, the decision,

652
00:39:45,191 --> 00:39:47,950
or maybe it's not related at all,
but the um,

653
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:51,160
the suggestion that Peter Lead the round,
uh,

654
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:53,140
it's the impression of some people that,

655
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:58,230
that you have actively
decided in the past not to be,

656
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:02,350
to take the CEO role yourself.
Uh,

657
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,110
and do you,

658
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:09,180
have you sort of proactively made
decisions in your life to avoid being a,

659
00:40:10,781 --> 00:40:15,040
to taking the CEO role or, or having
it for a long period of time and if so,

660
00:40:15,041 --> 00:40:17,110
why is that the case or
is that a misperception?

661
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:18,040
Well,

662
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:22,750
there's kind of three different CEO jobs
at levels of scale and the organization

663
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:24,820
as CEO jobs of,

664
00:40:24,821 --> 00:40:29,590
call it 10 20 50%
organizations or CEO jobs have,

665
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:32,290
you know, hundreds to, you know,

666
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:37,210
like 150 to 500 people organizations
and then their CEO jobs have,

667
00:40:37,211 --> 00:40:40,030
you know, over 500 people,
like a thousand or thousands.

668
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:45,130
I've always known that I'm fundamentally
not really interested in the CEO job

669
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:49,270
that the large scale CEO job,
when you're doing the large scale CEO job,

670
00:40:49,271 --> 00:40:52,090
your primary responsibility,
you have to invite me the strategy.

671
00:40:52,091 --> 00:40:53,800
You have to think about
the things the right way,

672
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:57,310
but you're probably problem primary
thing is the organization, you know,

673
00:40:57,311 --> 00:41:01,450
having the right or a culture, having
the right structure, the organization,

674
00:41:01,451 --> 00:41:04,390
the right people in it,
the right way of hiring new people,

675
00:41:04,391 --> 00:41:05,470
the right way of empowering them,

676
00:41:05,471 --> 00:41:07,780
even though you're making
kind of strategic decisions.

677
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:12,220
And there are people like Jeff Wiener
who are completely awesome at that and I

678
00:41:12,221 --> 00:41:15,550
rather help them rather than
being doing that, uh, personally.

679
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:20,350
Then you get to the other to see our job.
So you get to the mid stage CEO job,

680
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,800
I'm okay doing that. It's not the
thing I'm most passionate about.

681
00:41:23,801 --> 00:41:27,520
I actually prefer to work on,
you know, product a strategies,

682
00:41:27,521 --> 00:41:32,480
firefighting things, um,
uh, business strategies, uh,

683
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:34,010
problem solutions.

684
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:39,250
I'm thinking about how to reconceptualize
strategy the entire business and

685
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:41,690
either myself or we're
working with people on that,

686
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:46,520
but I'll do that in order to make it work.
And then in the early stages,

687
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:49,430
I'm actually pretty perfectly
comfortable doing it.

688
00:41:49,431 --> 00:41:51,830
It's not necessarily a job that
I say I walk, I must do it.

689
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:56,480
But being the CEO of a
10, 20, 50, you know,

690
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:58,340
even up to 100% organization,

691
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:03,500
I can do that just fine because then
you're still all kind of working on the

692
00:42:03,501 --> 00:42:06,830
same problem.
It's less about how you build the org.

693
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:10,250
Obviously you have to build a very strong
team, but it's less about like, okay,

694
00:42:10,251 --> 00:42:13,010
how do we take the org from a
hundred people to a thousand people?

695
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:17,150
It's actually much more
um, uh, like, okay,

696
00:42:17,151 --> 00:42:19,940
how do we just solve these key
problems and that stuff I like to do.

697
00:42:19,941 --> 00:42:21,050
So it isn't really a,

698
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:26,480
a specific don't want the CEO job except
in the very large scale. What it is is,

699
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:28,670
uh,
m I am,

700
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:33,840
I am only interested in the CEO job as
it's instrumental to something serious

701
00:42:33,891 --> 00:42:37,640
that I want to accomplish.
And then as that organization grows,

702
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:42,410
wants not to be the CEO.
And you've had some experience,

703
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:45,620
uh, searching for Ceos, uh,

704
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:50,570
what should founders remember when looking
for someone to replace themselves or

705
00:42:50,571 --> 00:42:55,100
things as you keep in mind? Well. So
the first thing is generally speaking,

706
00:42:55,130 --> 00:43:00,080
founders should try to go, like I'm still
very active at linkedin. Uh, should,

707
00:43:00,081 --> 00:43:04,250
she'll to try to go the entire course
of the company to the degree to which

708
00:43:04,251 --> 00:43:05,940
they're passionate and can be useful.

709
00:43:05,941 --> 00:43:07,940
And companies are always
stronger with founders,

710
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:12,620
more in the more connected
and committed to it. Um,

711
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:17,360
but that being said, sometimes you
go, look, my great skill set is,

712
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:18,440
you know,

713
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:23,390
a product or migrate Skillset
is evangelism or migrate
skill set is, you know,

714
00:43:23,391 --> 00:43:26,180
something other than building
the scale organization,

715
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,530
in which case the fundamental way
you look at it is, and then so the,

716
00:43:30,531 --> 00:43:33,050
the formal way that silicon valley
used to look at it, which is,

717
00:43:33,051 --> 00:43:34,220
I wrote an essay about this,

718
00:43:34,221 --> 00:43:38,210
it's published on my linkedin influencer
posts and all my, my sight, you know,

719
00:43:38,211 --> 00:43:39,990
Reid hoffman.org.
But the funnel,

720
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:44,370
the way that Silicon Valley used to look
at this is like you bring in gray hair

721
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:48,590
and executive a person with management
scale. And by that you want those skills.

722
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:51,380
But actually in fact, I think
what you're, what you're,

723
00:43:51,381 --> 00:43:53,510
who you're bringing in as a founder,

724
00:43:53,511 --> 00:43:57,290
as you're bringing in a lake later stage
co founder and you bringing in a later

725
00:43:57,291 --> 00:44:00,440
stage cofounder,
ideally who has scale skills,

726
00:44:00,441 --> 00:44:04,160
who knows how to build scale organizations
is passionate about this one.

727
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:07,540
You know, has their identity
as closely tied or, or,

728
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:11,010
or nearly as closely tied to the
organization as you do. It's,

729
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:13,880
it's this specific mission is
something that they really care about.

730
00:44:13,881 --> 00:44:16,610
They're not just like, oh, I'm a
hired gun, but actually in fact,

731
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,490
I'm a missionary on this as well.
And,

732
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:22,040
and then someone who would
partner with you very well,

733
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:27,030
and that's actually what you're looking
for. And so, uh, that's part of, you know,

734
00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:31,140
the reason why Jeff Wiener has been so
successful linkedin is because, you know,

735
00:44:31,141 --> 00:44:33,600
he cares about not just
scale organizations,

736
00:44:33,601 --> 00:44:36,420
but how do you transform people's careers?

737
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:40,420
How do you demonstrate you can be
doing compassionate business and the

738
00:44:40,421 --> 00:44:44,550
compassionate management is a high
performing a culture of a company. Uh,

739
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:47,790
how do you have people who are,
who have a culture of,

740
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:52,910
we make ourselves significantly
better every year? Um, you know,

741
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:55,890
how do you bring all of that? That's part
of what he actually really cares about,

742
00:44:55,891 --> 00:44:59,100
which links, which, you
know, uh, which, uh,

743
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:02,100
is deeply tied to the linkedin mission.
Uh,

744
00:45:02,101 --> 00:45:04,200
and so he cares what the organization,

745
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:08,910
he cares about the way he manages and
cares about the product at all as a, uh,

746
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:13,890
essentially a later stage cofounder. And
that's the kind of thing that you, uh,

747
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:16,950
you should be thinking about when you're
a founder and you're thinking, okay,

748
00:45:16,951 --> 00:45:20,640
it's time for me to bring
in a nother person as a CEO.

749
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:24,350
Thank you. Michael. I,

750
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:28,280
you mentioned accents a
little earlier and, uh,

751
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:31,010
that you use accents in the Er often.

752
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:36,620
And I know you've mentioned to me before
southern is best and I was hoping you

753
00:45:37,341 --> 00:45:39,170
can elaborate on that because

754
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:42,010
do you reckon struggle? But, um, no one,

755
00:45:42,310 --> 00:45:46,040
when I hit my head injury as a
kid and brain surgery is, uh,

756
00:45:46,570 --> 00:45:47,920
in the fourth,
fifth grade,

757
00:45:47,921 --> 00:45:52,180
yours like looking for like
ways to be more fluent. So,

758
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:56,860
uh,
in speeches I talk like I'm a European,

759
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:58,240
it's a good accent for speaking,

760
00:45:58,241 --> 00:46:00,310
but if I'm in the year I
took a gun from Alabama,

761
00:46:00,311 --> 00:46:03,070
Georgia cause it's a good
accent for sick people.

762
00:46:03,071 --> 00:46:06,220
You can almost like yell at them,
they don't think you're mad. So it's,

763
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:09,910
you can kind of raise the
volume of someone who is
hearing impaired pretty loud.

764
00:46:09,911 --> 00:46:14,911
They don't make him mad at him and it
keeps the nurses also kind of humorously

765
00:46:14,981 --> 00:46:17,170
enter attained as well.

766
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:22,720
And how has the er experience or the
skills developed or exhibited there

767
00:46:24,471 --> 00:46:28,370
translated to the other things that
you've done in the nonprofits or,

768
00:46:29,570 --> 00:46:30,770
or in the fall for profit?
Yeah,

769
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:31,613
investment world.

770
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:37,190
The Er particular has helped a lot
with my investing cause most of the

771
00:46:37,450 --> 00:46:40,920
specialties interface with the Er and
enabled me to like reach into like

772
00:46:40,921 --> 00:46:45,921
ophthalmology or a cardiology and
invest it in things like heartflow.

773
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:48,390
Um,

774
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:53,040
I can just pick up the phone and speak
to an eventual to hearts tuitions and

775
00:46:53,041 --> 00:46:57,870
things like that. So, um, I think
from a decision making capacity, it,

776
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:01,590
it teaches you the importance of actually
making a decision because you don't

777
00:47:01,591 --> 00:47:06,300
always have all the information you need,
but the stakes are high.

778
00:47:06,301 --> 00:47:10,680
So I think there's a lot
of entrepreneurial kind of
a crossover there that can

779
00:47:10,681 --> 00:47:11,440
also be helpful,

780
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:15,220
right? Making important decisions
with incomplete information. Well,

781
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:20,140
well, what also just the importance of
having actually a made a decision as well,

782
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:24,040
right? Because if you're
always kind of like waffling,
it's uh, something, you know,

783
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:25,113
nothing actually happened.

784
00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:30,040
And you and I have talked
a lot about meditation,

785
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:32,050
but more broadly speaking,

786
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:36,300
the people listening are very interested
in morning habits and morning routines.

787
00:47:36,301 --> 00:47:40,050
So I'd love to ask you guys
the same question. Let's
start with you Michael. Uh,

788
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:44,680
what does the first 60 to 90 minutes of
your day look like and what time does it

789
00:47:44,681 --> 00:47:47,140
start? If we could get into
specifics, that would be great.

790
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,360
Sure. More recently, many I, I,

791
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:53,280
I used to fight at this kind of hour and
a half awake in the middle of the night

792
00:47:53,281 --> 00:47:58,281
thing between two sleep cycle's not kind
of actually just kind of get up and do

793
00:47:58,411 --> 00:48:00,770
like probably half an hour to an hour.

794
00:48:00,771 --> 00:48:05,180
But I committed Taishan between like three
and 4:00 AM in the morning or foreign

795
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:10,560
five and that then hence me half an hour
of real clarity after that to kind of

796
00:48:10,561 --> 00:48:14,490
think about kind of my day and
how I'd like to end up using it.

797
00:48:15,390 --> 00:48:17,580
And what type of
meditation do you practice?

798
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:19,650
Uh,
there,

799
00:48:19,651 --> 00:48:24,651
there are concentration and mindfulness
techniques that you can use it a pretty

800
00:48:25,051 --> 00:48:29,490
common I think rather than
talk about the type of, I do,

801
00:48:29,491 --> 00:48:33,210
I think a lot of the debate
between types of meditations,

802
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:36,060
kind of like the debate of kinds
of like weight lifting people do.

803
00:48:36,061 --> 00:48:39,500
And I think the important thing is
that you actually dislike, you know,

804
00:48:39,570 --> 00:48:42,990
lift the weights. Right. So, um, I,

805
00:48:43,010 --> 00:48:47,490
I'm not convinced any one type of
mindfulness training is the superior to

806
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:48,271
another,

807
00:48:48,271 --> 00:48:51,510
but clearly almost anyone
would be superior to actually
not actually doing it.

808
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:54,620
Do you have any opinion of neurofeedback?

809
00:48:56,470 --> 00:48:58,720
I think generally,
even as an investor,

810
00:48:58,721 --> 00:49:03,721
I think there's beginning to
be a commercial break down
between the interface of

811
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:07,120
um,
the brain and you see these,

812
00:49:07,121 --> 00:49:10,750
the EEG feedback pieces of
equipment I think, or not,

813
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:15,610
not quite
as far along now as they should be,

814
00:49:15,611 --> 00:49:19,330
but I think you're certainly seeing some
nursing applications with people better

815
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,560
taking,
uh,

816
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:25,300
the interface with the mind out of the
realm of religion and into the realm of

817
00:49:25,570 --> 00:49:28,800
science and such. And I think, um, uh,

818
00:49:28,910 --> 00:49:32,950
there even like a prep high
schools who are doing a controlled

819
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:38,560
experiments on mindfulness to see how
it affects homer Kendo performance and

820
00:49:38,561 --> 00:49:39,310
things like that.

821
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:40,050
Yeah,
no,

822
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:44,350
definitely an Adam Gazzaley who was
also in this podcast at UCF is too,

823
00:49:44,351 --> 00:49:47,000
except really interesting work with uh,

824
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:52,050
iPad based or tablet based
games for quantifying um,

825
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:56,410
progress in meditation and mindfulness
up read. What about yourself?

826
00:49:56,411 --> 00:49:59,410
What are your morning rituals look like?
In an ideal day,

827
00:49:59,411 --> 00:50:02,410
assuming you have control of your morning,
uh,

828
00:50:03,010 --> 00:50:06,220
the first 60 to 90 minutes of your
day, what, what does, what does that,

829
00:50:06,310 --> 00:50:08,980
what does that look like if you
had your sort of optimal recipe?

830
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:13,850
Well, I dunno or not, but, um, and I
also don't know how it interesting is,

831
00:50:13,851 --> 00:50:17,810
but you know, most of my days are
pretty packed, uh, because of, you know,

832
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:20,420
responsibilities to
Greylock responsibilities,

833
00:50:20,430 --> 00:50:23,060
the linkedin portfolio
companies as much well things.

834
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:28,061
So where my morning tends to be most
highly tuned to is what does a creative

835
00:50:32,751 --> 00:50:35,800
problem that I've identified.
Uh,

836
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:39,770
either they like as something that I
was like, okay, I want to work on this.

837
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:42,260
I want to think about this, the night,
the day before that, before. It's like,

838
00:50:42,261 --> 00:50:46,910
this is a key thing that I want to think
about a product design, a strategy,

839
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:50,710
a solution to a problem that one of my
portfolio companies just looking at the,

840
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,400
that sort of thing,
uh,

841
00:50:52,430 --> 00:50:56,300
or I need to solve this thing creatively
for a meeting I'm having later today.

842
00:50:56,450 --> 00:51:01,250
Like, I'm, uh, we're making a decision
at Greylock to invest in something. Uh,

843
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:01,820
you know,

844
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:06,200
a team is going to be pitching me or
there's gonna be some kind of business

845
00:51:06,201 --> 00:51:09,920
development relationship between linkedin
or another of my portfolio companies.

846
00:51:11,090 --> 00:51:14,360
And so the very first thing
I do when I get up, uh,

847
00:51:14,361 --> 00:51:18,110
almost always is to actually sit down
and work on that problem because that's

848
00:51:18,111 --> 00:51:19,330
when I'm freshest.
Um,

849
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:24,200
I'm not distracted by
like phone calls and,

850
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:28,610
and responses to things and so
forth. So I'll, I'll, I'll actually,

851
00:51:29,010 --> 00:51:33,230
it's the most Tabula Rasa kind of
blanks like moment that I have.

852
00:51:33,231 --> 00:51:37,280
And so I used that to
maximize my creativity on a,

853
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:38,300
on a particular project.

854
00:51:38,301 --> 00:51:41,270
I'll do you usually do it
before I shower has frequently,

855
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:42,530
like if I go into the shower,

856
00:51:42,531 --> 00:51:44,420
then I'll continue to think
about it as I'm doing it,

857
00:51:44,421 --> 00:51:49,400
but I'll get it all fired up. Uh,
ideally I would have 60 minutes for that.

858
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:53,810
Some mornings I do a frequently,
it's like around 30, um,

859
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:57,800
just because of the press
of the day. And then, uh,

860
00:51:57,801 --> 00:52:01,520
the next things that kinda
round out of it's only 30, um,

861
00:52:01,970 --> 00:52:06,970
or a combination of a quick triage three
email to see if there's anything that's

862
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:08,200
a,
uh,

863
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:12,260
an emergency that's or kind of something
that's temporarily or otherwise

864
00:52:12,261 --> 00:52:17,030
important, uh, that I need to
get on right away. Uh, and then,

865
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:19,400
uh, frequently, um, most of my,

866
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:23,090
during the workweek I almost always
have a business breakfast. Uh,

867
00:52:23,091 --> 00:52:26,220
on some project could be anything
from a nonprofit, you know,

868
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:31,240
like Mozilla to a portfolio company or uh,

869
00:52:31,970 --> 00:52:35,640
just a general meeting with someone
who's been recommended to me. Uh,

870
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:39,920
and then on the drive to that breakfast,
um, frequently I'll do a call.

871
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:43,940
That's kind of one cause it's
one of those, uh, usually, uh,

872
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,870
the days are so packed with meetings
at some of the, the, the, the,

873
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:51,230
it's the typically the only
real phone time I have.

874
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:55,340
And so if there's someone I need to
talk to a that is not co located,

875
00:52:55,341 --> 00:52:57,560
that's usually when I called them.
Got It.

876
00:52:57,620 --> 00:53:00,230
And when you're working on
that first creative problem,

877
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:04,280
is that something that you've put
in a notebook the night before?

878
00:53:04,281 --> 00:53:08,870
Is it on a laptop? How are you storing
these problems and then working on them.

879
00:53:09,530 --> 00:53:14,060
Um,
so we'll either be most commonly,

880
00:53:14,061 --> 00:53:17,750
cause you know, I kind of grew up where
I was thinking by using a pen and paper.

881
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:23,270
Uh, most commonly I will a sketch to
few things, thought about a few things.

882
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,100
Uh,
it will be a salt know and usually it's

883
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:28,320
in the notion of how do
you solve this problem?

884
00:53:28,321 --> 00:53:31,140
Like a little bit back to the thing where
you're talking about is like setting

885
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:35,490
up that framework, like a strategy, you
know, within a strategy of the game.

886
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:39,180
What are the kind of key
things that you know,

887
00:53:39,181 --> 00:53:44,181
might be constraints on a solution or
might be the attributes of a solution and

888
00:53:45,061 --> 00:53:46,890
what are tools or assets I might have.

889
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:50,420
Because part of what I'm trying to
do is I actually think, you know, Mo,

890
00:53:50,550 --> 00:53:52,920
most of our thinking of
course it's subconscious,

891
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:58,410
is part of what I'm trying to do is allow
the fact that we have this kind of a

892
00:53:58,411 --> 00:54:02,220
relaxation, rejuvenation
period and sleeping, uh,

893
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:06,870
to essentially possibly bubble up the,

894
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:10,740
the thoughts and solutions to it.
And so when I woken up,

895
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:14,970
not only am I kind of Tabula
Rasa, but I'm also, uh,

896
00:54:15,150 --> 00:54:19,290
possibly primed for that. And so
then no, that's the way I do it.

897
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:23,210
Yeah, no, that makes perfect
sense. You've said before,

898
00:54:23,211 --> 00:54:27,380
read that your network is your mentor
and that you learn from everyone in your

899
00:54:27,381 --> 00:54:31,100
network. I'd love to just tick off a
couple of names of people I believe,

900
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:31,521
you know,

901
00:54:31,521 --> 00:54:35,540
and here the first thing that comes to
mind in terms of what you learn or have

902
00:54:35,541 --> 00:54:40,520
learned from them. Uh, you mentioned
earlier the CEO of Airbnb, Brian Chesky.

903
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,460
Uh, what would, what's the first
thing that comes to mind there,

904
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:46,690
Brian? Um, uh,

905
00:54:46,790 --> 00:54:50,860
one of the things I paid that I thought
was an excellent focus from him is that

906
00:54:50,861 --> 00:54:54,640
he, if he calls us seven star
design, which is, you know,

907
00:54:54,641 --> 00:54:58,470
most review systems are, uh,
you know, go to five stars.

908
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:03,010
And so seven stars was a thinking about
the design at a much broader scope.

909
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:07,000
But the precise way of thinking about it
is what he came to realize that airbnb

910
00:55:07,001 --> 00:55:11,710
is not just an online product. It's not
just the, uh, marketplace, a website,

911
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:17,100
but it's actually the whole
entire experience that you
have of going to the room

912
00:55:17,771 --> 00:55:21,880
or apartment of checking in,
of staying there and of leaving.

913
00:55:22,450 --> 00:55:25,840
And how do you actually, in fact, uh,

914
00:55:25,870 --> 00:55:29,230
best design within your abilities
of doing a peer to peer marketplace,

915
00:55:29,590 --> 00:55:32,770
that entire experience. And
so the way the, the, the,

916
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:36,640
the placeholder he uses for that is
this thinking of seven star design,

917
00:55:36,641 --> 00:55:40,300
which is thinking through
each step of the experience.

918
00:55:40,301 --> 00:55:45,301
And so I thought it was
a highly instructive and
something I know a use myself

919
00:55:46,181 --> 00:55:51,160
use when I talk to other
people because, um, uh,

920
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:55,870
our product isn't just, the website
isn't just the mobile application.

921
00:55:56,230 --> 00:55:59,590
It's the way that people are embedded in
the environment when they're using it.

922
00:55:59,591 --> 00:56:02,170
And you should think through that as much.
You can,

923
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:05,890
even though you may have some very limited
ability to control other aspects of

924
00:56:05,891 --> 00:56:06,160
it.

925
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:09,930
Hmm. Or shape. And, uh, what about, uh,

926
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,180
one of your partners at Greylock,
John Lilly?

927
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:18,160
So John is about as deep and
interesting as a technologist.

928
00:56:18,801 --> 00:56:20,870
You get a foreign investor,

929
00:56:21,350 --> 00:56:24,100
he puts together of both

930
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:27,910
the aspects of being very deeply
technical about platforms. I mean,

931
00:56:27,911 --> 00:56:32,911
he was the CEO of Mozilla growing it to
being 20% of web browsers with also kind

932
00:56:34,331 --> 00:56:36,280
of a design experience.

933
00:56:36,281 --> 00:56:39,400
Like he is a consulting professor
at the Stanford School of design.

934
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,570
And so for me, you know,
part of the thing that, uh,

935
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:48,220
I get from John and I've learned from
John is to think about the intersection of

936
00:56:48,221 --> 00:56:52,450
kind of user design with deep
technology and how, for example,

937
00:56:52,451 --> 00:56:57,070
design patterns then shape deep
technology patterns and kind of the,

938
00:56:57,430 --> 00:57:01,060
a set of different questions
that you'd ask about, look,

939
00:57:01,061 --> 00:57:04,540
what's the structure of the design space
and does that inform the structure of

940
00:57:04,541 --> 00:57:06,820
your technology space?
Um,

941
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:09,670
and so we talk about a whole
wide variety of technologies,

942
00:57:09,671 --> 00:57:10,930
but those are the kinds of,

943
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:16,380
of mental and strategy and thinking
patterns that I've gotten honed to a fine

944
00:57:17,561 --> 00:57:21,280
edge from John. Also a
hilarious guy. Very, yes.

945
00:57:21,370 --> 00:57:23,420
Sharp sense of humor.
Yes.

946
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:28,990
What about your former coworker
now SpaceX, Tesla founder,

947
00:57:28,991 --> 00:57:33,160
Elon Musk.
So Ilan obviously super smart,

948
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:37,420
obviously relentless, uh,
obviously thinking, you know,

949
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:41,290
like for example, the, the, the,
the old phrase, the sky's the limit.

950
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:45,990
That's too short free lawn, right?
You know, Mars and beyond. Um,

951
00:57:46,690 --> 00:57:50,740
uh, the thing that I most learned
from Ilan is actually in fact,

952
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:51,850
um,

953
00:57:51,850 --> 00:57:56,850
that so previous to Elan's
amazing successes with a
Tesla and SpaceX and solar

954
00:57:59,381 --> 00:58:04,330
city, uh, I had come to learn that,

955
00:58:04,450 --> 00:58:09,370
uh, that part of the business strategy
is to solve the simplest and easiest,

956
00:58:09,371 --> 00:58:11,950
most valuable problem.
And it actually in fact,

957
00:58:11,951 --> 00:58:14,560
part of doing strategies to
solve the easiest problem.

958
00:58:14,561 --> 00:58:17,830
So part of the reason why you work
in software and bits is that they,

959
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:22,480
that Adams are actually very difficult.
You have, uh, sometimes real material,

960
00:58:22,510 --> 00:58:27,400
you know, product development,
risk, inventory, risk,
material science, you know,

961
00:58:27,401 --> 00:58:29,950
all these things that
makes Adam products harder.

962
00:58:29,950 --> 00:58:31,900
And so if you can work
in the bits products,

963
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:34,870
it's a lot more valuable at
scales more quickly and so forth.

964
00:58:35,230 --> 00:58:39,130
And all of that's true in terms
of the fact that, that it wasn't,

965
00:58:39,131 --> 00:58:40,870
that that lesson I'd learned was false,

966
00:58:41,410 --> 00:58:44,140
but what Ilan taught me
was actually in fact,

967
00:58:44,141 --> 00:58:46,120
if you have a very deep
vision for something,

968
00:58:46,121 --> 00:58:49,990
you're relentless and you choose
something that really matters,

969
00:58:49,991 --> 00:58:53,360
that the competitors are in
fact really weak. Right? Right.

970
00:58:53,850 --> 00:58:56,260
Like there are not actually in
fact, like for example, you know,

971
00:58:56,261 --> 00:58:59,170
all of the rocket contractors,
um,

972
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:03,010
we're mostly focused on how do
they milk government contracts,

973
00:59:03,011 --> 00:59:05,830
not on how do they build
new propulsion systems,

974
00:59:05,831 --> 00:59:09,590
not on how do they take advantage
of the last couple of decades of,

975
00:59:09,730 --> 00:59:12,310
of actual progress.
Um,

976
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:16,140
and so that actually
gave him a, uh, as, uh,

977
00:59:16,170 --> 00:59:19,630
it's a very hard challenge. What he's
done is extremely compelling and,

978
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:22,100
and you know,
very few people could pull it off,

979
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:27,260
but that gives you a sufficient window
even when you're taking on a hard

980
00:59:27,261 --> 00:59:29,630
problem. And that's actually one
of the things I learned from Ilan

981
00:59:30,810 --> 00:59:35,510
and Juliana. kiva.org chairwoman. Yup.

982
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:38,360
What would you,
what would you say to that?

983
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:42,950
So Julie, um, now I
knew this already, but,

984
00:59:43,010 --> 00:59:47,210
um,
but Julie is a very good model for this,

985
00:59:47,211 --> 00:59:50,400
which is that you can
have someone who is a,

986
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:53,400
a worldclass entrepreneur,
uh,

987
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:58,380
Cirelli experience with it is a general
learner, has done enterprise, uh,

988
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:02,390
companies, uh, has transitioned
to thinking about open source,

989
01:00:02,780 --> 01:00:04,190
um,
uh,

990
01:00:04,210 --> 01:00:08,390
and was one of the early kind of people
of how to apply open source of things,

991
01:00:09,070 --> 01:00:14,070
can also go and thoroughly apply
all of those things into a,

992
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:17,740
not just the for profit world,
not just her own companies,

993
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:19,130
not just her angel investments,

994
01:00:19,550 --> 01:00:22,340
not just her work with areas
kind of incubators and others,

995
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:24,890
but also into the nonprofit world.

996
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:28,830
And where it's one of the
things when you say, you know,

997
01:00:28,850 --> 01:00:32,570
we have a tendency and in
Silicon Valley to say, you know,

998
01:00:32,571 --> 01:00:35,780
entrepreneurs are
heroes. Um, but you know,

999
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:40,710
one of the things I think is truly
heroic and awesome about what, uh,

1000
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:41,780
Julie has done is, hey, look,

1001
01:00:41,781 --> 01:00:46,781
I can take all these skills I can
take my entire life only just building

1002
01:00:47,331 --> 01:00:51,410
economics and, and, and, and enterprise
businesses and other kinds of businesses.

1003
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:53,120
But actually,
in fact,

1004
01:00:53,121 --> 01:00:56,570
when I begin to think about how do I
scale and how do I change the nature of

1005
01:00:56,571 --> 01:00:58,160
humanity and human ecosystems,

1006
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:02,060
I'm going to take my technology skills
and apply them to philanthropic projects

1007
01:01:02,061 --> 01:01:05,690
with the same kind of scale,
with the same kind of impulse.

1008
01:01:06,050 --> 01:01:07,490
And I'll put real time into it.

1009
01:01:07,491 --> 01:01:11,870
I'm not just going to talk about it and,
uh,

1010
01:01:11,871 --> 01:01:13,610
and I'm going to do it with,
you know,

1011
01:01:14,090 --> 01:01:18,620
the full set of skills that a worldclass
entrepreneur does. And so, you know,

1012
01:01:18,621 --> 01:01:19,490
I've seen,

1013
01:01:19,610 --> 01:01:23,900
I've taken heart and
inspiration from Julie about,

1014
01:01:24,270 --> 01:01:25,910
uh,
the value of,

1015
01:01:25,970 --> 01:01:30,970
of diving in and getting your hands
dirty on projects that are outside of the

1016
01:01:31,701 --> 01:01:34,470
commercial side for,
uh,

1017
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:37,730
that are really ones that you can
actually in fact get to massive scale.

1018
01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:43,360
And, uh, last last for this
list a US Senator Cory Booker,

1019
01:01:43,660 --> 01:01:46,480
who I actually met for the first
time at an event that you co hosted.

1020
01:01:46,481 --> 01:01:49,060
So thank you for that. But, uh, what,

1021
01:01:49,150 --> 01:01:54,130
what have you learned or admired, uh,
as it relates to Corey? Well, it's a,

1022
01:01:54,131 --> 01:01:58,530
Corey is I think a great civic.

1023
01:01:59,310 --> 01:02:02,910
Um, he, uh, you know,

1024
01:02:02,970 --> 01:02:07,970
is a entrepreneurial and bold himself
when he's was the mayor of Newark.

1025
01:02:08,730 --> 01:02:12,360
He lived in the housing projects in
order to know what the experience was in

1026
01:02:12,361 --> 01:02:15,530
order to be able to be,
to understand, you know,

1027
01:02:15,570 --> 01:02:19,980
kind of how does he maximize the
happiness and the economic potential

1028
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:24,270
and the, and solve the problems of
the people that he is there to help,

1029
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:28,770
you know, help as a mayor.
And then as a senator,

1030
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:30,000
uh,

1031
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:35,000
part of what I have found him
to be practically unique in,

1032
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:40,290
in like, or the leading edge.
There's, there are a few others, um,

1033
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:43,910
uh, who I think also do
this, but he does, he's the,

1034
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:48,330
the leading edge of I get that there's
silicon valley's creating all this kind

1035
01:02:48,331 --> 01:02:50,700
of interesting technology.
Um,

1036
01:02:50,730 --> 01:02:54,000
and I get that there's these
really powerful commercial
models and want to learn

1037
01:02:54,001 --> 01:02:56,250
from them. But when Corey
comes out to silicon valley,

1038
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:59,310
of course he has the interest that every
politician does, which is, you know,

1039
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:02,220
raising money and there's a bunch of
money in order to inform political

1040
01:03:02,221 --> 01:03:04,740
campaigns. But he's first, second,

1041
01:03:04,741 --> 01:03:07,620
and third questions aren't about
how do I get you to give me a check?

1042
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:12,620
It's how do I learn from you in order to
solve a problem that's critical for the

1043
01:03:12,781 --> 01:03:14,430
American people and in particular,

1044
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:19,560
critical for the people who may be being
left out, uh, but all people as well.

1045
01:03:19,860 --> 01:03:23,140
And so, you know, whether I'd,
his focus is on, you know,

1046
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:27,120
we have a really serious problem with
mass incarceration or whether the,

1047
01:03:27,150 --> 01:03:31,860
the challenges, um, you know,
what do we do? Um, in order to,

1048
01:03:31,890 --> 01:03:34,830
you know, kind of have a good
foreign policy, you know,

1049
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:36,930
any of these questions he starts with,

1050
01:03:36,931 --> 01:03:41,931
what do I learn from you that can then
help me figure out how to help us be

1051
01:03:43,021 --> 01:03:46,980
better, uh, as a, as a country. And,

1052
01:03:47,310 --> 01:03:49,680
and then of course, you
know, when you, you know,

1053
01:03:49,681 --> 01:03:53,250
if he ends up with alignment and he says,
look, you know, can you help me with x, Y,

1054
01:03:53,251 --> 01:03:57,990
and z? At that point, he
speaking your language, um, and,

1055
01:03:58,140 --> 01:03:58,680
uh,

1056
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:03,680
and as understood and has asked you to
participate and helping being a good

1057
01:04:03,691 --> 01:04:06,200
citizen. And you know, uh,

1058
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:10,640
if we could have a more
senators like, uh, you know,

1059
01:04:10,650 --> 01:04:13,470
Senator Booker, Corey my friend, uh,

1060
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:15,360
I think the world would
be a much better place.

1061
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:17,080
Yeah, totally agreed. He's,

1062
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:21,220
he's exceptional at asking
incisive questions. Uh,

1063
01:04:21,221 --> 01:04:23,180
and not just for the sake
of asking the questions,

1064
01:04:23,181 --> 01:04:28,100
but for actually listening to
the answers. Yup. Michael, uh,

1065
01:04:28,430 --> 01:04:33,230
what is the book that you have
given most as a gift or books?

1066
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:37,880
We suddenly actually
reach book with a been a,

1067
01:04:37,890 --> 01:04:41,220
because Nosha at the startup of you

1068
01:04:43,530 --> 01:04:45,510
and uh, why, why have
you chosen that book?

1069
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:46,510
Uh,
it,

1070
01:04:46,510 --> 01:04:50,370
it just has a lot of principles in it
for young people right out of college or

1071
01:04:50,371 --> 01:04:51,690
kind of in the middle of their

1072
01:04:53,370 --> 01:04:55,890
20s and such to think about
how to pursue their careers.

1073
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:57,950
Got It. And what, and a,

1074
01:04:57,970 --> 01:05:00,980
what would be your will be your second
book if you had to pick a second,

1075
01:05:02,290 --> 01:05:06,640
uh,
well,

1076
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:07,800
to young people,

1077
01:05:07,801 --> 01:05:11,850
I often give them a simple book you've
probably heard about called getting

1078
01:05:11,851 --> 01:05:16,420
things done. David Allen,
combine that with, uh,

1079
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:22,440
the seven habits of highly
effective people because I
think the former helps you

1080
01:05:22,931 --> 01:05:24,250
to actually to,

1081
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:29,200
to action and the ladder healthier side,
which actions to actually,

1082
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:33,760
you know, take. So I mentor
a lot of young people. Um,

1083
01:05:33,850 --> 01:05:36,280
and I think those two books
together are probably good for them.

1084
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:38,430
Wonderful. Yeah, we're going to,

1085
01:05:38,490 --> 01:05:41,070
we're going to dive into quest Virginia
second because I want to make sure that

1086
01:05:41,071 --> 01:05:45,090
we covered that. Uh, read.
What about yourself, the,

1087
01:05:45,110 --> 01:05:49,530
the book or books that you've given
most as gifts besides the ones that, uh,

1088
01:05:49,710 --> 01:05:51,060
that you've been involved with directly?

1089
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:55,070
Yes. Well, obviously I tend to give out
my two books to start off with you and the

1090
01:05:55,071 --> 01:05:56,490
alliance,
uh,

1091
01:05:56,570 --> 01:05:59,510
a fair amount of partially because you
can sign it and you can make it very

1092
01:05:59,511 --> 01:06:04,280
personalized and it becomes a very,
you know, a personal touch gift. Uh,

1093
01:06:04,281 --> 01:06:08,880
I'd say the two books that I
have recently most given out, um,

1094
01:06:08,930 --> 01:06:13,580
one of them is a conscious business
by Fred Kaufman and Fred is,

1095
01:06:13,581 --> 01:06:18,581
I think to some degree the modern high
spiritual priest of capitalists business.

1096
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:25,270
Uh, his whole kind of thread is to say,
actually, in fact, how you can, uh,

1097
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:30,080
express business and capitalism as
a spiritual practice of compassion.

1098
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:33,470
Um, and I, you know, he, you know, it's a,

1099
01:06:33,471 --> 01:06:38,270
it's a book that opens with a discussion
of Aristotle and, you know, not, not, not,

1100
01:06:38,271 --> 01:06:41,990
you wouldn't be surprised, be surprised
on a business book. So that's one.

1101
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:46,490
And then the other one is
Sapiens by Yuval Harari,

1102
01:06:46,970 --> 01:06:51,050
which is a very grand, it's one of
the ones I've read most recently.

1103
01:06:51,430 --> 01:06:55,820
Um, a grand theory of humanity
and kind of how does the,

1104
01:06:56,070 --> 01:07:00,950
is cognition work? Um, and I
don't know enough to know, like,

1105
01:07:00,951 --> 01:07:03,590
is it really deep scholarly work or not?

1106
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:08,620
But it's exactly the kind of broad
thinking book that I think should be more

1107
01:07:08,661 --> 01:07:11,270
and, you know, a general consciousness.

1108
01:07:12,610 --> 01:07:17,550
And Michael, you, uh, you
mentioned mentoring. I think
this is a good segue. Uh,

1109
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:20,740
could you please describe a questbridge,
uh,

1110
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:22,580
and what questbridge does
because of course, that's,

1111
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:27,500
that's a common thread that ties
everyone on this call together. Uh,

1112
01:07:27,530 --> 01:07:30,260
reed being,
correct me if I'm wrong,

1113
01:07:30,261 --> 01:07:33,290
but a chair of the advisory board,
I'm,

1114
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:37,940
I'm one participant on the advisory board
and very honored to be part of that.

1115
01:07:37,941 --> 01:07:39,980
But could you describe a,
and you of course,

1116
01:07:40,010 --> 01:07:44,770
are one of the cofounders of questbridge.
Could you describe for P for folks, uh,

1117
01:07:44,810 --> 01:07:48,020
what it is a questbridge does and
some of the results or numbers?

1118
01:07:48,540 --> 01:07:53,220
Sure. I'll describe what it does and when
the problem it solves as well. Um, and,

1119
01:07:53,221 --> 01:07:56,300
and you said Ruby does the head of
the advisory board and we've really

1120
01:07:56,301 --> 01:07:59,610
appreciated your, her
both with Tim. So, uh,

1121
01:07:59,990 --> 01:08:04,990
questbridge is on one level simply a
common application for super smart low

1122
01:08:05,871 --> 01:08:10,871
income kids heading to top schools
like Princeton and Yale and swap mourn,

1123
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:15,470
Emerson such,
um,

1124
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:19,580
you can apply to other schools for
free whether application online, um,

1125
01:08:19,610 --> 01:08:24,170
the schools help to offset the costs of
the pool so we don't have to raise a lot

1126
01:08:24,171 --> 01:08:28,360
of money and kin of focus on execution.
Uh,

1127
01:08:28,490 --> 01:08:32,760
the scale is reached, um,
insignificant and whereabouts, um, at,

1128
01:08:32,770 --> 01:08:37,510
at some schools, about half
of their diversity. And we
put in more low income, uh,

1129
01:08:37,630 --> 01:08:42,080
kids in all the other nonprofits in
the country actually all combined. Um,

1130
01:08:42,110 --> 01:08:43,830
but there are a lot more out there.
And,

1131
01:08:43,831 --> 01:08:47,840
and the interesting thing in America that
people don't know is there's actually

1132
01:08:47,841 --> 01:08:51,380
no shortage of smart low
income kids to use up.

1133
01:08:51,381 --> 01:08:55,910
All of these kinds of
wonderful of financial aid
opening schools can afford to

1134
01:08:55,911 --> 01:08:59,380
pay a full tuition award. Um, it's just,

1135
01:08:59,390 --> 01:09:01,100
they simply aren't
handing in applications.

1136
01:09:01,101 --> 01:09:05,540
And so we're trying to make that
process simpler. But in real numbers,

1137
01:09:05,541 --> 01:09:09,290
we had over 140 kids
accepted to Yale last year,

1138
01:09:09,291 --> 01:09:12,300
over 110 my were excepted.
Um,

1139
01:09:12,380 --> 01:09:15,650
the majority of those accepted
would actually go. Uh,

1140
01:09:16,340 --> 01:09:20,690
so I'm the one hand, our numbers
are large. On the other hand,

1141
01:09:20,691 --> 01:09:23,180
we've probably gone from,

1142
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:28,240
from finding and having them apply like
one in 14 of the qualified kids to one

1143
01:09:28,821 --> 01:09:33,800
in nine. Um, you could fail, uh, several,

1144
01:09:33,990 --> 01:09:34,870
uh,

1145
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:39,140
times over every top school with smart,

1146
01:09:39,350 --> 01:09:43,730
qualified going to come back at Demec
kids for all the financial aid openings.

1147
01:09:44,460 --> 01:09:48,630
And uh, I'm sorry, go ahead. I didn't
mean to interrupt. If you had more there,

1148
01:09:48,660 --> 01:09:49,050
but I,

1149
01:09:49,050 --> 01:09:51,000
oh no, I didn't. My wife
and I had been doing this.

1150
01:09:51,001 --> 01:09:56,001
Now I'm in some form for
about 20 years or so and uh,

1151
01:09:56,680 --> 01:09:58,530
are, are, are hitting a good scale,

1152
01:09:58,531 --> 01:10:02,250
but our Brooklyn people like we had
another is to try to increase our scale.

1153
01:10:02,251 --> 01:10:05,820
And also now we have about 8,000
students in our schools. You know,

1154
01:10:05,850 --> 01:10:10,850
how do you bring them into the corporate
world in like medical schools and

1155
01:10:11,671 --> 01:10:12,450
things also?

1156
01:10:12,450 --> 01:10:16,890
And, uh, the, uh, for
those interested, uh, the,

1157
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:18,990
the New York Times,
The Wall Street Journal's had some,

1158
01:10:18,991 --> 01:10:22,230
some excellent feature pieces
recently on questbridge read.

1159
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:27,260
You get asked for you to
participate in different projects,

1160
01:10:28,111 --> 01:10:30,330
different startups,
different nonprofits all the time.

1161
01:10:30,630 --> 01:10:35,630
What is it about questbridge that
led you to decide to participate,

1162
01:10:36,510 --> 01:10:38,010
to contribute to it,
to be part of it?

1163
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:38,771
Well,

1164
01:10:38,771 --> 01:10:43,771
it's actually a very similar process to
how I actually make a decision to be an

1165
01:10:44,441 --> 01:10:48,940
investor. Um, uh, not 100%, but close,

1166
01:10:48,941 --> 01:10:50,650
which is, you know, roughly speaking,

1167
01:10:50,651 --> 01:10:54,170
I think the mission of life is
how do you maximize humanity, uh,

1168
01:10:54,220 --> 01:10:57,190
the expression of human potential.
Uh,

1169
01:10:57,191 --> 01:11:02,070
our consciousness, our, uh, our, our,

1170
01:11:02,071 --> 01:11:05,320
our sense of ethics and ethos
are ways of being with together.

1171
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:07,480
And when you look at
Questbridge, you'd say, well,

1172
01:11:07,481 --> 01:11:12,481
here is actually in fact one very
intelligent system design for that because

1173
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:18,870
the, you know, the way that you can
change a life of this high talent,

1174
01:11:18,871 --> 01:11:23,871
low income kid by providing a
path and an understanding and a,

1175
01:11:24,750 --> 01:11:29,750
an a way of succeeding through a strong
college is not only a way to change a

1176
01:11:29,971 --> 01:11:34,770
life, uh, but also to change the
world, uh, because you know, those,

1177
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:37,380
that not only did they change
their own lives, but then they,

1178
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:41,520
they model for others, they can
essentially get back to the community. Uh,

1179
01:11:41,550 --> 01:11:44,460
and also then folks who,
you know,

1180
01:11:44,461 --> 01:11:47,640
benefit from elite universities,

1181
01:11:47,641 --> 01:11:52,410
have the knowledge and understanding
and compassion to, you know,

1182
01:11:52,411 --> 01:11:53,244
kind of what are the,

1183
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:58,500
the challenges for lower income and can
help participate in a really positive

1184
01:11:59,191 --> 01:12:02,190
way. So a part of, you know, um,

1185
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:07,230
I think if anything, you know, Michael's
being, uh, you know, kind of, uh,

1186
01:12:07,590 --> 01:12:12,030
socially, uh, EPT and discreet and not,
you know, kind of saying, look, it's a,

1187
01:12:12,270 --> 01:12:15,210
it's an application but not all as
an application. It's a community.

1188
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:19,050
It's a community, helps, uh,

1189
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:24,080
helps those kids succeed through college
and then connect with the world around

1190
01:12:25,021 --> 01:12:27,450
them at large. And so it's, it's, uh,

1191
01:12:28,020 --> 01:12:32,250
it was a very quick and easy
decision to, uh, to join and help.

1192
01:12:32,540 --> 01:12:37,080
And so, Michael, what I'd
like to do is just give a,

1193
01:12:37,090 --> 01:12:38,330
as a,

1194
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:43,020
an example of the type of thing that gets
me excited about questbridge and fee.

1195
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:46,610
Please feel free to correct me because I
know this is just a small part or maybe

1196
01:12:46,611 --> 01:12:50,020
one example, but for those
people listening, I mean I'm,

1197
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:54,170
I'm involved with a number of
nonprofits, but I, it, I try to apply,

1198
01:12:54,171 --> 01:12:59,171
like read the same level of scrutiny and
high expectations to nonprofits that I

1199
01:13:00,981 --> 01:13:05,180
would to for profits. And that's it.
It turns out to be very challenging.

1200
01:13:05,630 --> 01:13:09,200
Um, but in the case of Questbridge,
Reid mentioned earlier,

1201
01:13:09,620 --> 01:13:13,370
part of strategy being
solving the easiest,

1202
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:14,780
most valuable problem.

1203
01:13:14,781 --> 01:13:19,781
And I think part of that is identifying
of course the right problem.

1204
01:13:20,330 --> 01:13:25,070
And, uh, as you mentioned, Michael,
there's a lot of money out there.

1205
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:27,500
There is a lot of money.
Uh,

1206
01:13:27,580 --> 01:13:31,220
beat at colleges will give students more
than $300,000 each to go to college.

1207
01:13:31,250 --> 01:13:36,200
The, the, one of the issues is
simply the lack of applications.

1208
01:13:36,201 --> 01:13:40,340
These kids don't apply oftentimes,
and they may not have the social support.

1209
01:13:40,370 --> 01:13:45,050
It may not even enter their minds to
apply. So how do you solve that problem?

1210
01:13:45,051 --> 01:13:48,230
Because a lot of people are trying to
solve the wrong problem by throwing more

1211
01:13:48,231 --> 01:13:52,010
money at the problem, doing it too late,
and they miss the window of opportunity.

1212
01:13:52,011 --> 01:13:56,780
And so what, what really caught my
attention first about questbridge was,

1213
01:13:56,840 --> 01:13:59,000
uh,
just one small example,

1214
01:13:59,270 --> 01:14:03,440
which was in these communities where
they may not even be thinking of applying

1215
01:14:03,441 --> 01:14:05,930
to college, uh, doing, for instance,

1216
01:14:05,931 --> 01:14:10,931
an Ipad giveaway or a giveaway of some
type and the application or form to sign

1217
01:14:12,401 --> 01:14:14,770
up for this giveaway potentially,
uh,

1218
01:14:14,771 --> 01:14:19,771
and when just so happens to also be a
standardized application that you've

1219
01:14:20,291 --> 01:14:25,270
convinced 36 top schools to accept as,
as college applications.

1220
01:14:25,270 --> 01:14:29,920
And so these kids are incentivized in a
way that is kind of culturally relevant

1221
01:14:29,921 --> 01:14:34,690
to them. And then they get a letter in
the mail saying, Hey, by the way, uh,

1222
01:14:34,750 --> 01:14:38,860
Princeton University here, we'd like to
offer you a full ride for four years.

1223
01:14:38,890 --> 01:14:42,790
And it's just such an elegant solution.

1224
01:14:42,791 --> 01:14:47,791
And it's such an example for
me at least of putting in a,

1225
01:14:48,370 --> 01:14:51,620
getting a very large result for a,
uh,

1226
01:14:51,750 --> 01:14:56,320
a small input, a small intervention.
Um, and that's why, you know,

1227
01:14:56,420 --> 01:14:59,260
I've been so excited to,
uh,

1228
01:14:59,290 --> 01:15:01,840
to talk about questbridge and I've been
looking forward to this interview for

1229
01:15:01,841 --> 01:15:06,190
many other reasons also. But to try
to showcase it for people to say like,

1230
01:15:06,191 --> 01:15:08,920
not all hard problems
have to be hard to solve.

1231
01:15:08,950 --> 01:15:12,710
You just have to really surgically
focus in the right place. Um,

1232
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:16,600
so I'd love to ask just as it
relates to Questbridge, uh,

1233
01:15:17,260 --> 01:15:22,150
what's, what if for people who want to
learn more, where should they go? And,

1234
01:15:22,220 --> 01:15:23,230
uh,
there,

1235
01:15:23,250 --> 01:15:27,490
there are many people listening to
this show who are perhaps like me,

1236
01:15:27,491 --> 01:15:32,491
have recognized how they were set
down a very fortunate path by having

1237
01:15:33,850 --> 01:15:38,250
educational opportunities that are
not available to everyone. Um, so for,

1238
01:15:38,251 --> 01:15:43,251
for people who might want
to contribute to such a,

1239
01:15:43,361 --> 01:15:47,420
you know, an effective Archimedes
lever like questbridge, you know,

1240
01:15:47,421 --> 01:15:50,590
where should they go and,
and how might they be able to help?

1241
01:15:51,150 --> 01:15:52,350
Sure. Um, I,

1242
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:58,110
I think to clarify the problem to so
your listeners can understand it. Um,

1243
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:02,710
the, uh, before questbridge,

1244
01:16:02,730 --> 01:16:06,770
about three quarters of the diversity
withdrawn from only fifth Patina,

1245
01:16:06,780 --> 01:16:08,160
urban areas in the country.

1246
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:12,870
So you were more likely to hear about
heading to a school like Swarthmore,

1247
01:16:12,871 --> 01:16:17,871
if you had a 2.8 from Harlem and if you
had a 4.0 from a lot of other areas in

1248
01:16:17,881 --> 01:16:22,620
the country.
So questbridge recruits that at uh,

1249
01:16:23,130 --> 01:16:25,500
you know, in New York, in
Chicago like other people do,

1250
01:16:25,501 --> 01:16:30,501
but also in like buffalo and Syracuse
and other areas of the country,

1251
01:16:31,230 --> 01:16:33,300
um,
in defense of the kids,

1252
01:16:33,301 --> 01:16:37,920
it's not intuitive at a school and give
you $300,000 for free of course. So,

1253
01:16:37,921 --> 01:16:38,401
so,

1254
01:16:38,401 --> 01:16:43,401
so to get their application data quest
is unique in that we have our own kind of

1255
01:16:43,921 --> 01:16:47,470
application data set. So as
you said, if we create, um,

1256
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:52,470
a prize or if others you
wanted to help us do that, uh,

1257
01:16:52,620 --> 01:16:57,600
we've had a lot of success in attracting
applicants to fulfill out a college

1258
01:16:57,601 --> 01:17:01,770
application for a proposition
unrelated to the application itself.

1259
01:17:02,330 --> 01:17:05,220
Um, so if it's a student
who wants to get involved,

1260
01:17:05,221 --> 01:17:08,190
they can simply go to our
website@questbridge.org.

1261
01:17:08,191 --> 01:17:10,040
We have an application actually open

1262
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:14,210
now for, um, this falls application cycle.

1263
01:17:14,211 --> 01:17:17,570
We have access to about half
a billion dollars of, uh,

1264
01:17:17,630 --> 01:17:21,590
financial aid from our
universities. And we'd like to, um,

1265
01:17:22,660 --> 01:17:23,421
uh,
you know,

1266
01:17:23,421 --> 01:17:28,421
harvest more of America's latent talent
from areas that we haven't reached

1267
01:17:28,551 --> 01:17:30,890
earlier. Um, I,

1268
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:35,780
I'd say to your listeners to make sure
that your local high school actually uses

1269
01:17:35,781 --> 01:17:40,070
our application and that I'm
only about a third of the,

1270
01:17:40,550 --> 01:17:44,090
the high schools in the country
have handed applications in. Um,

1271
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:48,020
and then for people who would like
to create their own intervention,

1272
01:17:48,021 --> 01:17:52,040
let's say for low income kids wanting
to do maths and science of low income

1273
01:17:52,041 --> 01:17:55,760
women are low income people from
the south or almost any interest,

1274
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:59,850
they can even reach out to
me, to me directly. And uh,

1275
01:18:00,330 --> 01:18:04,210
uh, on your, uh, body,

1276
01:18:04,211 --> 01:18:07,370
you can feel free to put my email address
if you'd like to. Okay, wonderful.

1277
01:18:07,371 --> 01:18:10,580
And would you like to give that out now
or would you prefer this one? Yeah, yeah,

1278
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:15,590
it's Michael, um, uh, at quest bridge.org.

1279
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:17,050
Great.

1280
01:18:17,050 --> 01:18:17,890
And by prizes,

1281
01:18:17,891 --> 01:18:22,891
you mean people could offer some type
of what w what might uprise look like?

1282
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:26,300
Yeah, it's really odd. It could be,

1283
01:18:26,301 --> 01:18:30,890
it could be nonmonetary
like we'd like to say, um,

1284
01:18:31,390 --> 01:18:36,350
you know, have a, a leadership award at
like the White House Strip something. Um,

1285
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:41,090
but it can get simple as we ran a pilot
for native Americans where we give away

1286
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:46,300
a 20 laptops cooking the actual
university application up to the uprise

1287
01:18:46,490 --> 01:18:51,490
application and we grew from
having only 34 applicants one year,

1288
01:18:51,681 --> 01:18:54,790
two or 350,
um,

1289
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:56,913
the year after that.

1290
01:18:57,650 --> 01:19:02,330
So for everyone listening, I just want to
really encourage you, I, I am very, very,

1291
01:19:02,670 --> 01:19:04,550
uh,
I have a very,

1292
01:19:04,551 --> 01:19:09,551
very tight filter tightness filter when
it comes to working with nonprofits and

1293
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:14,480
uh, this, this one is worth your time. So
I would just encourage you to look at it.

1294
01:19:14,860 --> 01:19:15,440
Um,

1295
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:20,380
forget about the label nonprofit as an
intervention that can better humanity. Um,

1296
01:19:20,450 --> 01:19:22,460
as, as reed mentioned, this is,

1297
01:19:22,490 --> 01:19:25,910
this is one of the rare gems out
there in my opinion. And you know,

1298
01:19:25,911 --> 01:19:29,150
other organizations that I've worked
with, like donors choose, for instance,

1299
01:19:29,151 --> 01:19:31,880
Charles Best is a huge fan of questbridge.
And he said,

1300
01:19:31,950 --> 01:19:34,820
the first thing he said to me when I
mentioned a few years ago that Michael,

1301
01:19:34,821 --> 01:19:37,490
you and I connected, he said,
that is an excellent choice.

1302
01:19:37,491 --> 01:19:39,260
That is an awesome choice.
Um,

1303
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:43,490
so people check out questbridge.org and
you can reach Michael if you'd like to

1304
01:19:43,491 --> 01:19:47,930
discuss, uh, collaborating in
some way. michael@questbridge.org.

1305
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:51,080
So I'll just ask one more question guys.

1306
01:19:51,110 --> 01:19:55,910
It'll take a one or two minutes
and that is, um, let's, uh, let's,

1307
01:19:55,911 --> 01:19:56,840
let's start with you Michael.

1308
01:19:56,841 --> 01:20:00,110
If you could have one billboard
anywhere that said anything,

1309
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:01,850
what would it say and where would it be?

1310
01:20:04,030 --> 01:20:08,760
I probably have people do what you do
to Jim. Pick something you're afraid

1311
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:13,560
of every day and in kind of go after it.
And uh,

1312
01:20:14,590 --> 01:20:18,570
I'd put that on kind of peoples
a way to work I suppose.

1313
01:20:18,990 --> 01:20:19,990
What about yourself read?

1314
01:20:22,550 --> 01:20:26,330
Well,
this is kind of a I a funny reflex,

1315
01:20:26,331 --> 01:20:28,190
but was just something I
would thinking about recently.

1316
01:20:28,191 --> 01:20:30,830
I think I would take the
billboard in Washington DC.

1317
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:33,650
I think I would target
congresspeople and I say,

1318
01:20:33,710 --> 01:20:36,530
have you worked with someone
across the aisle today?

1319
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:39,620
Because what matters is
not partisan conflict,

1320
01:20:39,621 --> 01:20:44,180
but how do we govern our country
to actually have a better future

1321
01:20:44,930 --> 01:20:48,350
here, here. Definitely.
Last question guys.

1322
01:20:48,351 --> 01:20:52,580
Do you have any ask or request
for my audience? Uh, read,

1323
01:20:52,581 --> 01:20:56,060
we can start with you.
And then where can people find you online?

1324
01:20:56,720 --> 01:20:59,570
Where can they ping you on
social networks, et Cetera?

1325
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:02,580
Well,
on social networks it's very easy.

1326
01:21:02,581 --> 01:21:06,860
There's this service that maybe a few
people have heard of called Linkedin, uh,

1327
01:21:06,890 --> 01:21:11,670
you know, find double there. Um,
I'd say two things. Uh, one is,

1328
01:21:11,730 --> 01:21:15,920
uh, you know, I would also
echo the fact that, uh,

1329
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:20,720
questbridge is a scale, uh, way of, of,

1330
01:21:20,780 --> 01:21:25,140
of changing the world for the better
of actually making us more of the,

1331
01:21:25,830 --> 01:21:26,221
you know,

1332
01:21:26,221 --> 01:21:30,810
kind of for us in the u s the American
dream in terms of the ability for,

1333
01:21:30,870 --> 01:21:35,730
uh, for talented low income
youth to actually, you know,

1334
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:39,640
uh, live in a meritocracy.
So I think it's a awesome,

1335
01:21:39,641 --> 01:21:44,070
and whatever way you can support
whether it's contributing or helping or,

1336
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:47,430
you know, pointing out the right
talented young kid added is all great.

1337
01:21:48,030 --> 01:21:49,890
And then the second is,
you know,

1338
01:21:49,891 --> 01:21:54,210
last year I published a book
called the alliance. Uh,

1339
01:21:54,211 --> 01:21:59,160
your audience tends to be highly
literate, not a surprise given you, uh,

1340
01:21:59,190 --> 01:22:02,760
and so in as much as they're
thinking about how has the nature of,

1341
01:22:02,820 --> 01:22:06,450
of employment and how has the nature of,
of um,

1342
01:22:06,810 --> 01:22:09,810
of the relationship between an
employee in a company changing,

1343
01:22:09,870 --> 01:22:13,230
I think it might be something that
could stimulate a few thoughts.

1344
01:22:13,690 --> 01:22:17,440
Definitely. And I have a copy of that
book at home and as f everybody, uh,

1345
01:22:17,470 --> 01:22:22,380
highly worth the read, uh,
so highly recommended there.
Well Gentlemen, uh, this,

1346
01:22:22,381 --> 01:22:23,650
this has been wonderful.

1347
01:22:23,710 --> 01:22:27,220
I've really enjoyed the conversation
and for everybody listening,

1348
01:22:27,250 --> 01:22:32,250
I will put everything we discussed in
the show notes so we'll have links to

1349
01:22:32,321 --> 01:22:35,780
questbridge, the book recommendations
and so on. Uh, just got a four hour work,

1350
01:22:35,781 --> 01:22:40,690
week.com all spelled out and click
on podcast to find that. And,

1351
01:22:40,691 --> 01:22:44,230
uh, guys, I really appreciate
you making the time. This was,

1352
01:22:44,231 --> 01:22:47,440
this was a lot of fun and I have pages
and pages of notes just for myself.

1353
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:51,020
Tim, I'll always a pleasure
and always an honor.

1354
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:54,190
Thank you for the conversation to
all right guys. Until next time,

1355
01:22:54,191 --> 01:22:57,820
thank you and everyone else. Until
next time. Thank you for listening.

This episode is brought to you by 99
your one stop shop for all things graphic

1357
01:23:07,721 --> 01:23:08,830
design related.

1358
01:23:08,860 --> 01:23:13,860
I've used 99 designs for everything
from banner ads to book covers including

1359
01:23:14,680 --> 01:23:17,560
sketches and mock ups that
led to the four hour body,

1360
01:23:17,561 --> 01:23:21,520
which later became number one New York
Times Number One Wall Street Journal and

1361
01:23:21,550 --> 01:23:22,361
the brainstorming.

1362
01:23:22,361 --> 01:23:25,690
A lot of it took place with designers
from around the world and here's how it

1363
01:23:25,691 --> 01:23:29,890
works. Whether you need a t
shirt, a business card, a website,

1364
01:23:30,190 --> 01:23:32,470
an APP thumbnail,
whatever it might be,

1365
01:23:32,710 --> 01:23:36,190
you submit that project and
designers from around the world.

1366
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:38,860
We'll send you sketches
and mock ups and designs.

1367
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:42,550
You choose your favorite and you have an
original that you love or you get your

1368
01:23:42,551 --> 01:23:43,210
money back.

1369
01:23:43,210 --> 01:23:46,990
It's that straightforward and many of you
who are listening have already used it

1370
01:23:46,991 --> 01:23:49,450
and created some amazing things
that I'll be sharing in the future.

1371
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:52,090
But in the meantime, if you want

Tim,

1375
01:24:06,910 --> 01:24:10,000
this episode is brought to you by
a new sponsor. So listen up folks.

1376
01:24:10,001 --> 01:24:13,960
This is a good one because have you ever
wanted to be as powerful as a bullet

1377
01:24:13,961 --> 01:24:18,961
wearing Ninja from 1980s movie or as
flamboyant as big gay Al Big Al in south

1378
01:24:20,381 --> 01:24:24,480
park or as sleek as a black panther
and the Amazon on the hunt wealth?

1379
01:24:24,481 --> 01:24:28,660
There's great because I've been testing
this product that you wrap around your

1380
01:24:28,661 --> 01:24:32,640
genitals and it makes you feel like a
superhero and it is called [inaudible].

1381
01:24:32,770 --> 01:24:36,340
That's for the last two to three weeks
traveling with underwear from these guys

1382
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:38,650
and they are comfy.
I got to tell you,

1383
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:43,300
it feels like a Geisha has given your
groin a hug. And it's not just for dudes.

1384
01:24:43,330 --> 01:24:48,020
But if you go to me undies.com forward

that I've been wearing.

1387
01:24:53,050 --> 01:24:57,730
There's some pretty ridiculous ones. And
uh, I will also highlight my favorite,

1388
01:24:57,820 --> 01:25:01,390
you'll probably be able to guess which
it is these underwear made from micro

1389
01:25:01,391 --> 01:25:06,340
model, which is extruded from Austrian
beechwood trees in the Alps. Yes. Fancy.

1390
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:09,490
And it's two times softer than cotton,
scientifically tested.

1391
01:25:09,570 --> 01:25:12,790
Is it the Calamata method
developed in Kyoto? You know,

1392
01:25:12,791 --> 01:25:17,200
this Japanese very crafty and uh, I
will say a few things. Number one,

if you go to [inaudible]

1394

underwear that I'd been wearing and I am

1395
01:25:23,261 --> 01:25:27,460
a bit of an underwear connoisseur,
socks, fashion sense with sweat pants,

1396
01:25:27,461 --> 01:25:29,470
not so much underwear.
I understand.

ladies wearing BMDS female underwear.

1399
01:25:38,710 --> 01:25:42,460

both the men and the women out there.

So check it out.

1402
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:53,260
probably six to 12 pair to take
with me to Australia. They're great.

Check them out. [inaudible] dot com
