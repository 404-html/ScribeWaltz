1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,890
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02,891 --> 00:00:06,090
I can run flat out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,280
You posted a question.

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,530
I'm a cybernetic organism living tissue.

5
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,220
This episode is brought
to you by four sigmatic.

6
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:30,070
You might remember four sigmatic
for their mushroom coffee,

7
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,860
which was created by those
clever finish founders.

8
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,680
And when I first mentioned
that coffee on this podcast,

9
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:39,190
the product sold out in less than a week
at lights you up like a Christmas tree,

10
00:00:39,191 --> 00:00:41,710
which can be really useful.
However,

11
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:46,120
recently I've been testing the opposite
side of the spectrum of new product and

12
00:00:46,121 --> 00:00:50,950
that is their Reishi mushroom elixir
to help me end my day to get to sleep.

13
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:53,890
As you guys may know,
longtime listeners,

14
00:00:53,891 --> 00:00:57,580
at least I struggled with insomnia for
decades. I have a largely fixed that,

15
00:00:57,581 --> 00:01:00,700
but still shutting off my monkey
brain has never been easy,

16
00:01:00,701 --> 00:01:03,400
still isn't easy very often.
And I found Reishi,

17
00:01:03,401 --> 00:01:06,790
which had been fascinated by for
a few years now, has been very,

18
00:01:06,791 --> 00:01:10,720
very effective and calming
their old formula. However,

19
00:01:10,721 --> 00:01:15,610
forcing Maddix old formula included
Stevia. And I like to avoid sweeteners,

20
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:18,430
all sweeteners for a host of reasons.

21
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:22,450
And I then just ping them and asked,
hey guys,

22
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:26,160
I would love to experiment with
this and maybe actually suggested,

23
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,620
but I'd like a version without
sweeteners if you'd be open to it,

24
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,880
if too much of a headache,
don't worry.

25
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:35,050
And they are always game
for experimentation.

26
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,770
So they created a special custom version
without the Stevia, without sweeteners.

27
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,320
Now it is part of my nightly routine.

28
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,440
Their ratio looks or comes
in single serving packets,

29
00:01:44,441 --> 00:01:45,470
which are perfect for travel.

30
00:01:45,471 --> 00:01:48,580
And in fact I'm about to leave the
country right now and I have a packet in

31
00:01:48,581 --> 00:01:52,450
front of me. This just going to
sit in the end of my carry on bag.

32
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:56,410
You only need hot water and it mixes very,
very easily.

33
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:01,180
Here's some recommended copy
that they put in the read.

34
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,240
So I'm going to read it and then
I'll give you my take quote,

35
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,520
a warning for those in
the experimental mindset,

36
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:10,030
Reishi is strong and bitter in
parentheses, like any great medicine.

37
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,590
So if the bitterness is too much,

38
00:02:11,591 --> 00:02:15,920
I recommend trying it with honey and or
nut milk such as almond milk and quote.

39
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,100
So I'm going to say no,

40
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:22,630
you should suck it up and you should drink
the tea because it's not that bitter.

41
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:26,170
And maybe you should take the advice
of all Chinese people when they're

42
00:02:26,171 --> 00:02:29,350
criticizing young. When they
say [inaudible] sure. Cool.

43
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,750
Which means you're not
able to eat bitterness.

44
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:36,780
Bitter is in many cases and indication
of things that help liver detoxification

45
00:02:37,511 --> 00:02:39,670
and so on.
Not saying that's the case here,

46
00:02:39,671 --> 00:02:44,470
but I've tested this ratio
lecture on family members,

47
00:02:44,471 --> 00:02:48,280
on friends, everybody has liked it. It's
a little bit earthy. It's not that hard.

48
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,770
So I would just say suck it up and no,

49
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:54,970
don't put in honey or milk or any of
that shit. Just drink the goddamn tea.

50
00:02:54,971 --> 00:02:58,060
It's delicious I think. Right? If
you like poo air, that kind of stuff,

51
00:02:58,061 --> 00:03:01,600
that type of tea, you're going
to dig it. So just try it. Okay.

52
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,710
Back to then my read. If you'd like
to naturally improve your sleep,

53
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,630
both onset and quality,

54
00:03:07,631 --> 00:03:12,631

71
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,030
Am I sexy?
Little mink says,

72
00:04:22,031 --> 00:04:25,600
this is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another
episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

73
00:04:25,601 --> 00:04:27,730
it is my job generally speaking,

74
00:04:27,731 --> 00:04:31,600
to deconstruct world class performers of
different types to tease out the habits,

75
00:04:31,601 --> 00:04:33,370
routines,
favorite books,

76
00:04:33,371 --> 00:04:36,640
and so on that you can use this episode,

77
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:41,950
I'm going to showcase one
of my recent favorite books,

78
00:04:41,951 --> 00:04:44,020
and by recent I say in the last few years,

79
00:04:44,021 --> 00:04:48,790
there are not many books that I highlight,

80
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:51,640
something within nearly every page,

81
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:55,300
much less than printing
out those highlights,

82
00:04:55,301 --> 00:04:59,110
putting them together with a binder clip
and carrying around at various points

83
00:04:59,111 --> 00:05:03,580
to review and to journal
on and so forth and so on.

84
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:09,120
That book that I'm referring to is
essential ISM subtitled the disciplined

85
00:05:09,491 --> 00:05:12,190
pursuit of less.
It is a fantastic book.

86
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:15,070
I was very impressed the
first time I read it.

87
00:05:15,071 --> 00:05:18,640
I've been continually
impressed when I've rewrite it.

88
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:24,060
It's had an impact in how I approached
various types of problems and

89
00:05:24,161 --> 00:05:28,570
opportunities, so I want to share
two chapters from that book with you.

90
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:33,400
Read by the author Greg Mckeown,
Gregory McEuen on Twitter.

91
00:05:33,401 --> 00:05:36,880
Let me spell that for you.
It's a little tricky for most yanks,

92
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:42,370
Gregory McKeown, m a, C, k, e, O, w, n,

93
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:47,470
also Gregory mccuin.com. Uh, and uh,

94
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,280
I'm lying.

95
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:53,280
It is not Gregory [inaudible] dot com
it's Greg mckeown.com so you can figure it

96
00:05:53,681 --> 00:05:53,890
out.

97
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:58,340
There aren't too many Greg or Gregory
McKeown's running around with essential

98
00:05:58,341 --> 00:05:59,060
ism.

99
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:04,060
The two chapters that I'm going to share
are related to how to say no gracefully

100
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,400
and how to uncommit because I think it
is very easy to listen to podcasts with

101
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:16,240
success stories and tactics and habits
and to create an ever growing or never

102
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,500
ending to do list.

103
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:23,530
You might have 73 different things on
the draft version of your morning routine

104
00:06:24,831 --> 00:06:25,820
and that is stressful.

105
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
So I would like to help you visa vi
Greg and his book essential ism to maybe

106
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:38,180
shorten your to do list and lengthen
your not to do list. So again,

107
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:41,190
these two chapters are from essential ism,
subtitle,

108
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,320
the disciplined pursuit of less.

109
00:06:42,321 --> 00:06:45,500
Maybe sometime I will have Greg
on the podcast discuss further,

110
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,930
but this episode is experimental.

111
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:53,030
I am considering showcasing books,
not brand new books.

112
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,130
So publishers who are
listening do not hammer.

113
00:06:55,131 --> 00:06:59,150
We with a thousand pitches they're not
going to get in, will not be on. Uh,

114
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:03,330
but books that were published at least a
few years ago showcasing books that, uh,

115
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:08,030
I have read at least two
times and this is one of them.

116
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:12,470
So let me know if you like it. And without
further ado, how to say no gracefully.

117
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,990
How to uncommit by Greg McKeown.

118
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:22,500
Chapter 11.
Dare the power of a graceful.

119
00:07:22,501 --> 00:07:26,490
No.
Courage is grace under pressure.

120
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:31,490
Ernest Hemingway,
the right,

121
00:07:31,491 --> 00:07:35,150
no spoken at the right time can
change the course of history

122
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:39,410
in just one example of many Rosa parks.

123
00:07:39,411 --> 00:07:44,411
Quiet but resolute refusal to give up her
seat on a segregated Montgomery bus at

124
00:07:44,481 --> 00:07:48,710
exactly the right moment coalesced into
forces that propelled the civil rights

125
00:07:48,711 --> 00:07:51,470
movement as Ponch recalls.

126
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,110
When the bus driver saw me still sitting,

127
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,430
he asked if I was going to
stand up and I said, no, I'm not

128
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:02,180
contrary to popular belief.
Her courageous,

129
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:06,920
no did not grow out of a particularly
assertive tendency or personality in

130
00:08:06,921 --> 00:08:07,754
general.

131
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:11,780
In fact when she was made a secretary to
the president of the Montgomery chapter

132
00:08:11,781 --> 00:08:13,010
of the Naacp,

133
00:08:13,011 --> 00:08:17,990
she explained I was the only woman there
and they needed a secretary and I was

134
00:08:17,991 --> 00:08:21,410
too timid to say no.
Rather,

135
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:25,730
her decision on the bus grew out at a
deep conviction about what deliberate

136
00:08:25,731 --> 00:08:26,870
choice she wanted to make.

137
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:31,670
In that moment when the bus driver
ordered her out of her seat, she said,

138
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:36,530
I felt a determination cover my
body like a quilt on a winter night.

139
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:41,630
She did not know how her decision would
spark a movement with reverberations

140
00:08:41,631 --> 00:08:44,810
around the world,
but she did know her own mind.

141
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,600
She knew even as she was being arrested
that it was the very last time that I

142
00:08:50,601 --> 00:08:55,601
would ever ride in humiliation of this
kind of avoiding that humiliation was

143
00:08:55,831 --> 00:09:00,210
worth the risk of incarceration.
Indeed to her, it was essential.

144
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:06,480
It is true that we are hopefully unlike
the to find ourselves facing a situation

145
00:09:06,481 --> 00:09:11,190
like the one faced by Rosa parks.
Yet we can be inspired by her.

146
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,820
We can think of her when we need
the courage to dare to say no.

147
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,290
We can remember her strength of conviction
when we need to stand our ground and

148
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:22,650
the face of social pressure to
capitulate to the nonessential.

149
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:27,840
Have you ever felt a tension between
what you felt was right and what someone

150
00:09:27,841 --> 00:09:29,010
was pressuring you to do?

151
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:34,320
Have you ever felt the conflict between
your internal conviction and an external

152
00:09:34,321 --> 00:09:35,154
action?

153
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:39,930
Have you ever said yes when you meant
no simply to avoid conflict or friction?

154
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:45,960
Have you ever felt too scared or timid
to turn down an invitation or a request

155
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:48,390
from a boss, colleague, friend, neighbor,

156
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:53,250
or family member for fear of disappointing
them? If you have, you're not alone.

157
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,690
Navigating these moments with courage
and grace is one of the most important

158
00:09:57,691 --> 00:10:01,320
skills to master in becoming an
essentialist and one of the hardest.

159
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,700
I did not set out to write
a chapter about courage,

160
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:08,850
but the deprive looked at
the subject of essentialism.

161
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,600
The more clearly I have seen courage
as key to the process of elimination

162
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:16,890
without courage. The disciplined
pursuit of less is just lip service.

163
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:22,530
It is just the stuff of one more dinner
party conversation. It is skin deep.

164
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:27,330
Anyone can talk about the importance of
focusing on the things that matter most

165
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:31,830
and many people do, but to see
people who dare to live. It is rare.

166
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:37,650
I say this without judgment.
We have good reasons to fear saying no,

167
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:42,930
we worry. We'll miss out on
a great opportunity. We're
scared of rocking the boat,

168
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,880
stirring things up,
burning bridges.

169
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:50,400
We can't bear the thought of disappointing
someone we respect and like none of

170
00:10:50,401 --> 00:10:53,940
this makes us a bad person.
It's a natural part of being human.

171
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:59,610
Yet as hard as it can be to say no to
someone failing to do so can cause us to

172
00:10:59,611 --> 00:11:01,920
miss out on something far more important.

173
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:07,320
A woman named Cynthia once told me a
story about the time her father had made

174
00:11:07,321 --> 00:11:10,110
plans to take her on a
night out in San Francisco,

175
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:14,790
12 year old Cynthia and her father
had been planning the date for months.

176
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:20,670
They had a whole itinerary planned down
to the minute she would attend the last

177
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:24,570
hour of his presentation and then meet
him at the back of the room at about four

178
00:11:24,571 --> 00:11:27,690
30 and leave quickly.
Before everyone tried to talk to him,

179
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,980
they would catch a trolley car
to Chinatown, eat Chinese food,

180
00:11:31,981 --> 00:11:34,260
their favorite shop for a souvenir,

181
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,400
see the sites for a while and then
catch a flick as a dad like to say.

182
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:43,380
Then they would grab a taxi back to the
hotel, jump in the pool for a quick swim.

183
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:46,650
Her Dad was famous for sneaking
in when the pool was closed,

184
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,270
order a hot fudge Sundae from room
service and watched the late late show.

185
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,450
They discussed details over
and over before they left.

186
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,420
The anticipation was part
of the whole experience.

187
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:03,610
This was all going according to plan
until as a father was leaving the

188
00:12:03,611 --> 00:12:07,510
convention center. He ran into an old
college friend and business associate.

189
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,800
It had been years since they had seen
each other and Cynthia watched as they

190
00:12:11,801 --> 00:12:14,890
embraced enthusiastically,
his friends said, in effect,

191
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:18,250
I am so glad you are doing some
work with our company. Now.

192
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,730
When Lois and I heard about it,
we thought it would be perfect.

193
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:26,650
We want to invite you and
of course Cynthia to get a
spectacular seafood dinner

194
00:12:26,651 --> 00:12:30,280
down at the wharf. Cynthia's
father responded, Bob,

195
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:33,220
it's so great to see you dinner
at the wharf. Sounds great.

196
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:36,160
Synthio was crestfallen.

197
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:41,890
Daydreams of trolley rides and ice cream
Sundaes evaporated in an instant plus

198
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,760
she hated seafood and she
could just imagine how bored
she would be listening to

199
00:12:45,761 --> 00:12:49,480
the adults talk all night,
but then her father continued,

200
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:54,310
but not tonight. Cynthia and I
have a special date plan, don't we?

201
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,440
He winked at Cynthia and grabbed her
hand and they ran out of the door and

202
00:12:59,441 --> 00:13:02,950
continued with what was an
unforgettable night in San Francisco.

203
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:08,380
As it happens, Cynthia's father was the
management thinker, Stephen r Covey,

204
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:13,570
author of the seven habits of highly
effective people who had passed away only

205
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:17,910
weeks before. Cynthia told me this
story, so it was with deep emotion.

206
00:13:17,911 --> 00:13:20,170
She recalled that
evening in San Francisco.

207
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:25,600
His simple decision bonded him to me
forever because I knew what mattered most

208
00:13:25,601 --> 00:13:30,370
to him was me. She said, Stephen r Covey,

209
00:13:30,371 --> 00:13:33,910
one of the most respected and widely
read business thinkers of his generation

210
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:34,900
was an essential list.

211
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:39,880
Not only did he routinely teach essential
list of principles like the main thing

212
00:13:39,881 --> 00:13:40,900
is to keep the main thing,

213
00:13:40,901 --> 00:13:44,770
the main thing to important leaders
and heads of state around the world.

214
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:49,420
He lived them and in this moment
of leaving them with his daughter,

215
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:53,170
he made a memory that literally
outlasted his lifetime.

216
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,890
Seeing with some perspective
his decisions seems obvious,

217
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:01,210
but many in his shoes would have accepted
the friends invitation for fear of

218
00:14:01,211 --> 00:14:05,590
seeming rude or ungrateful or passing up
a rare opportunity to dine with an old

219
00:14:05,591 --> 00:14:06,424
friend.

220
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,120
So why is it so hard in the moment to
dad to choose what is essential over what

221
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:13,084
is non essential?

222
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:19,590
One simple answer is we are unclear about
what is essential when this happens,

223
00:14:19,811 --> 00:14:22,450
we become defenseless.
On the other hand,

224
00:14:22,451 --> 00:14:24,850
when we have strong internal clarity,

225
00:14:24,851 --> 00:14:28,990
it is almost as if we have a force field
protecting us from the non essentials

226
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:32,320
coming at us from all directions.
With Rosa.

227
00:14:32,321 --> 00:14:37,321
It was a deep moral clarity that gave
her unusual courage of conviction with

228
00:14:37,451 --> 00:14:37,990
Steven.

229
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:41,350
It was the clarity of his vision for
the evening with his loving daughter.

230
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,840
In virtually every instance,

231
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:47,650
clarity about what is essential fuels
us with the strength to say no to the

232
00:14:47,651 --> 00:14:48,484
nonessentials.

233
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,540
Yeah.

234
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,373
Essentially

235
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,980
a second reason why it is hard to choose.

236
00:14:54,981 --> 00:14:58,850
What is essential in the moment is
as simple as an innate fear of social

237
00:14:58,851 --> 00:15:03,260
awkwardness. The fact is we as humans are
wired to want to get along with others.

238
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:04,401
After all,

239
00:15:04,401 --> 00:15:07,610
thousands of years ago when we all
lived in tribes of hunter gatherers,

240
00:15:07,611 --> 00:15:11,990
our survival depended on it and while
conforming to what people in a group

241
00:15:11,991 --> 00:15:14,660
expect of us,
what psychologists call normative,

242
00:15:14,661 --> 00:15:17,390
conformity is no longer a
matter of life and death.

243
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,530
The desire is still deeply
ingrained in us. This is why,

244
00:15:21,531 --> 00:15:25,370
whether it's an old friend who invites
you to dinner or a boss who asks you to

245
00:15:25,371 --> 00:15:29,960
take on an important high profile project
or a neighbor who begs you to help

246
00:15:29,961 --> 00:15:33,530
with the PTA bake sale.
The very thought of saying no,

247
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:37,880
literally brings us physical discomfort.
We feel guilty.

248
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:40,220
We don't want to let someone down.

249
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:43,190
We are worried about
damaging the relationship,

250
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,400
but these emotions and muddle our clarity.

251
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:51,350
They distract us from the reality of
the fact that either we can say no and

252
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:56,210
regret it for a few minutes or we
can say yes and regret it for days,

253
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,730
weeks, months, or even years.

254
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,400
The only way out of this trap is to
learn to say no firmly, resolutely,

255
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:07,400
and yet gracefully because once we do,

256
00:16:07,401 --> 00:16:11,150
we find not only that our fears of
disappointing or angering others were

257
00:16:11,151 --> 00:16:14,540
exaggerated,
but the people actually respect us more.

258
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,970
Since becoming an essentialist,

259
00:16:16,971 --> 00:16:20,810
I have found it almost universally true
that people respect and admire those

260
00:16:20,811 --> 00:16:22,940
with the courage of conviction to say no.

261
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:25,910
Peter Drucker in my view,

262
00:16:25,911 --> 00:16:30,050
the father of modern management thinking
was also a master of the art of the

263
00:16:30,051 --> 00:16:33,380
graceful. No. When me, hi, sent me. Hi.

264
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,700
The Hungarian professor most well known
for his work on flow reached out to

265
00:16:37,701 --> 00:16:41,060
interview a series of creative
individuals for a book he was writing on

266
00:16:41,061 --> 00:16:41,900
creativity.

267
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,580
Truckers response was interesting enough
to me high that he quoted it verbatim.

268
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:52,340
I am greatly honored and flattered by
your kind letter of February 14th for I

269
00:16:52,341 --> 00:16:56,690
have admired you and your work for many
years and I've learned much from it,

270
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:01,820
but my dear professor [inaudible] hi,
I am afraid I have to disappoint you.

271
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:06,380
I could not possibly answer your
questions. I am told I am creative.

272
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:09,920
I don't know what that means.
I just keep on plodding.

273
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:13,820
I hope you will not think me
presumptuous or rude if I say that.

274
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:18,590
One of the secrets of productivity in
which I believe whereas I do not believe

275
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,700
in creativity,

276
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:24,770
is to have a very big waste paper basket
to take care of all invitations such as

277
00:17:24,771 --> 00:17:25,604
yours.

278
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:31,130
Productivity in my experience consists
of not doing anything that helps the work

279
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:34,970
of other people,
but to spend all one's time on the work.

280
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:38,480
The good Lord has fitted
one to do and to do well.

281
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:41,050
A true essential list.

282
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:45,230
Peter Drucker believed that people
are effective because they say no.

283
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:46,860
Okay.

284
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:51,240
Nonessentialist say yes because of
of social awkwardness and pressure.

285
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:56,640
They say yes automatically without
thinking often in pursuit of the Rusch one

286
00:17:56,641 --> 00:17:58,200
gets from having please someone,

287
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,780
but essential is know that after
the rush comes the Pang of regret,

288
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:09,860
they know they will soon feel bullied and
resentful both at the other person and

289
00:18:09,901 --> 00:18:14,100
that themselves. Eventually they will
wake up to the unpleasant reality.

290
00:18:14,101 --> 00:18:18,000
That's something more important must now
be sacrificed to accommodate this new

291
00:18:18,001 --> 00:18:21,990
commitment. Of course, the point
is not to say no to all requests.

292
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:24,120
The point is to say no
to the nonessential.

293
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:26,910
So we can say yes to the
things that really matter.

294
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:32,370
It is to say no frequently
and gracefully to everything,

295
00:18:32,371 --> 00:18:34,620
but what is truly vital,

296
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:40,350
a nonessentialist avoid saying no to
avoid feeling social awkwardness and

297
00:18:40,351 --> 00:18:44,670
pressure and essentially
just dares to say no firmly,

298
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:49,790
resolutely and gracefully and
nonessentialist says yes to everything and

299
00:18:50,971 --> 00:18:54,240
essentially just says yes only
to the things that really matter.

300
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,840
So how do we learn to say no gracefully.

301
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:02,220
Below are general guidelines followed
by a number of specific scripts for

302
00:19:02,221 --> 00:19:03,570
delivering the graceful no.

303
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:05,600
Yeah.

304
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,030
Separate the decision
from the relationship.

305
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:11,210
When people ask us to do something,

306
00:19:11,211 --> 00:19:14,450
we can confuse the request with
our relationship with them.

307
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:17,340
Sometimes they seem so interconnected.

308
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,930
We forget that denying the request is
not the same as denying for person.

309
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:24,860
Only once we separate the
decision from the relationship,

310
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:29,510
can we make a clear decision and then
separately find the courage and compassion

311
00:19:29,511 --> 00:19:30,344
to communicate it.

312
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,400
Okay.

313
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,240
Saying no gracefully doesn't
have to mean using the word no.

314
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:42,270
Essentially lists choose no
more often than they say no.

315
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:47,100
There may be a time when the most
graceful way to say no is to simply say a

316
00:19:47,101 --> 00:19:51,480
blunt no, but whether it's, I am
flattered that you thought of me,

317
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:55,710
but I'm afraid I don't have the
bandwidth or I would very much like to,

318
00:19:55,711 --> 00:19:56,790
but I'm over committed.

319
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:02,160
There are a variety of ways of refusing
someone clearly and politely without

320
00:20:02,161 --> 00:20:03,780
actually using the word know.

321
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:08,850
Later in the chapter you'll find more
examples of ways to gracefully word,

322
00:20:08,851 --> 00:20:12,860
y'all know,
focus on the trade off.

323
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,680
The more we think about what we are
giving up, when we say yes to someone,

324
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,510
the easier it is to say no.

325
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:24,610
If we have no clear sense of the
opportunity cost, in other words,

326
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,440
the value of what we are giving up,

327
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:30,790
then it is especially easy to fall
into the nonessential trap of telling

328
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:32,950
ourselves we can get it all done.

329
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:38,790
We can't a graceful no grows out of a
clear but unstated calculation of the

330
00:20:38,861 --> 00:20:43,780
trade off. Remind yourself that
everyone is selling something.

331
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,110
This doesn't mean you
have to be cynical about,

332
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,050
I don't mean to imply
people shouldn't be trusted.

333
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,960
I'm simply saying everyone
is selling something.

334
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:56,560
An idea of viewpoint and opinion
in exchange for your time.

335
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:01,090
Simply being aware of what is being
sold allows us to be more deliberate in

336
00:21:01,091 --> 00:21:02,860
deciding whether we want to buy it.

337
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:09,820
Make your peace with the fact that saying
no often requires trading popularity

338
00:21:09,821 --> 00:21:10,654
for respect.

339
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:12,180
Okay.

340
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:16,050
When you say no, there is usually a
short term impact on the relationship.

341
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:20,220
After all, when someone asks for
something and doesn't get it,

342
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:24,330
his or her immediate reaction may be
annoyance or disappointment or even anger.

343
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,280
This downside is clear. The
potential upside, however,

344
00:21:29,281 --> 00:21:33,960
is less obvious when the initial annoyance
or disappointment or anger wears off.

345
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:37,860
The respect kicks in.
When we pushed back effectively,

346
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:40,260
it shows people that our
time is highly valuable.

347
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,830
It distinguishes the
professional from the amateur.

348
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:49,650
A case in point is the time that graphic
designer Paul rand had the guts to say

349
00:21:49,651 --> 00:21:54,390
no to Steve Jobs when jobs was looking
for a logo for the company. Next,

350
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:55,681
he asked rand,

351
00:21:55,681 --> 00:22:00,681
who's work included the logos for IBM
ups and Ron Westinghouse and ABC to come

352
00:22:02,551 --> 00:22:06,750
up with a few options, but ran, didn't
want to come up with a few options.

353
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:10,980
He wanted to design just
one option. Saran said, no,

354
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:17,010
I will solve your problem for you and
you will pay me and you don't have to use

355
00:22:17,011 --> 00:22:20,220
the solution. If you want
options, go talk to other people,

356
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:23,310
but I will solve the problem the best way.
I know.

357
00:22:23,311 --> 00:22:27,030
How do you use it or not?
That's up to you.

358
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,100
Not surprisingly,

359
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:32,670
[inaudible] solved the problem and
created the jewel logo jobs wanted,

360
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:38,100
but the real lesson here is the effect
Rans pushback had on jobs who later said

361
00:22:38,101 --> 00:22:38,934
a rand.

362
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:43,380
He is one of the most professional
people I've ever worked with in the sense

363
00:22:43,381 --> 00:22:47,460
that he had thought through all of the
formal relationship between a client and

364
00:22:47,461 --> 00:22:51,600
a professional such as himself
ran took a risk when he said no.

365
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:57,410
He bet a short term popularity loss for
a long term gain in respect and it paid

366
00:22:58,051 --> 00:22:58,884
off

367
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:04,360
essentially just accept they cannot be
popular with everyone all of the time.

368
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,970
Yes.
Saying no respectfully,

369
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:10,780
reasonably and gracefully can
come at a short term social cost,

370
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:15,850
but part of living the way of the
essential list is realizing respect is far

371
00:23:15,851 --> 00:23:19,060
more valuable than
popularity in the long run.

372
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:21,200
Yeah.

373
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,390
Remember the tick clear. No can be more
graceful than a vague or noncommittal.

374
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,233
Yes.

375
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:32,040
As anyone who has ever been
on the receiving end of
this situation knows a clear

376
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,330
I am going to pass on.

377
00:23:33,331 --> 00:23:37,260
This is far better than not getting back
to someone or stringing them along with

378
00:23:37,261 --> 00:23:38,430
some noncommittal answer.

379
00:23:38,431 --> 00:23:42,270
Like I will try to make this
work or I might be able to.

380
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:45,150
When you know you can't,
being vague,

381
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:48,410
not the same as being graceful
and delaying the eventual no,

382
00:23:48,411 --> 00:23:52,340
we'll only make it that much harder and
the recipient that much more resentful.

383
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,830
The no repertoire,
remember essential list.

384
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,210
Don't say no,

385
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:05,240
just occasionally it is a part of their
regular repertoire to consistently say

386
00:24:05,311 --> 00:24:06,091
no with grace.

387
00:24:06,091 --> 00:24:11,091
Then it helps to have a variety of
responses to call upon following our eight

388
00:24:11,611 --> 00:24:14,460
responses.
You can put in your no repertoire

389
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:21,380
one the awkward pause instead of being
controlled by the threat of an awkward

390
00:24:22,261 --> 00:24:26,940
silence. Own it. Use it as a
tool. When a request comes to you.

391
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:31,110
Obviously this works only in person.
Just pause for a moment.

392
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:36,510
Count to three before delivering your
verdict or if you get a bit more bold,

393
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:39,030
simply wait for the other
person to fill the void

394
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,800
to the soft no or the no,

395
00:24:43,801 --> 00:24:47,880
but I recently received an
email inviting me to coffee.

396
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:53,340
I replied, I am consumed with writing
my book right now, Smiley face,

397
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,610
but I would love to get together.
Once the book is finished,

398
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:59,520
let me know if we can get together
towards the end of the summer.

399
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:03,960
Email is also a good way to
start practicing saying no,

400
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:07,710
but because it gives you the chance
to draft and redraft, y'all know,

401
00:25:07,711 --> 00:25:09,510
to make it as graceful as possible.

402
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:15,290
Plus many people find that the
distance of email reduces the fear of

403
00:25:15,511 --> 00:25:18,060
awkwardness.
Three,

404
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:21,120
let me check my calendar
and get back to you.

405
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,190
One leader I know found her time being
hijacked by other people all day.

406
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:28,560
A classic nonessentialist.

407
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:32,190
She was capable and smart
and unable to say no,

408
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,550
and as a result,
she soon became a goto person.

409
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,650
People would run up to her and say,

410
00:25:37,651 --> 00:25:41,460
could you help with x project meaning
to be a good citizen? And she said yes,

411
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:45,390
but soon she felt burdened with
all of these different agendas.

412
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,260
Things changed for her.
When she learned to use a new phrase,

413
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:51,600
let me check my calendar
and get back to you.

414
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:56,850
It gave her the time to pause and
reflect and ultimately reply that she was

415
00:25:56,851 --> 00:25:58,170
regretfully unavailable.

416
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:02,820
It enabled her to take back control of
her own decisions rather than be rushed

417
00:26:02,821 --> 00:26:04,560
into a yes when she was asked

418
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:09,230
for use email bounce backs.

419
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,190
It is totally natural and expected to
get an auto response when someone is

420
00:26:14,191 --> 00:26:18,900
traveling or out of the office. Really
this is the most socially acceptable? No,

421
00:26:18,901 --> 00:26:22,740
there is. People aren't saying they
don't want to reply to your email.

422
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:26,010
They're just saying they can't get
back to you for a period of time,

423
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:31,680
so why limit these to vacations and
holidays? When I was writing this book,

424
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:35,460
I sent an email bounce back with
the subject line in monk mode.

425
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:38,250
The email said,
dear friends,

426
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:43,140
I'm currently working on a new book which
has put enormous burdens on my time.

427
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:48,990
Unfortunately, I am unable to respond
in the manner I would like for this.

428
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:52,560
I Apologize, Greg, and guess what?

429
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:57,630
People seem to adapt to my temporary
absence and non-responsiveness just fine.

430
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:03,480
Five say yes.
What should I do?

431
00:27:03,481 --> 00:27:08,481
Prioritize saying no to a senior
leader at work is almost unthinkable,

432
00:27:08,611 --> 00:27:11,790
even laughable for many people.
However,

433
00:27:11,791 --> 00:27:15,930
when saying yes is going to compromise
your ability to make the highest level of

434
00:27:15,931 --> 00:27:20,730
contribution to your work, it is
also your obligation. In this case,

435
00:27:20,731 --> 00:27:23,670
it is not only reasonable to say no,
it is essential.

436
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:28,260
One effective way to do that is to
remind your superiors what you would be

437
00:27:28,261 --> 00:27:31,770
neglecting if you said yes and forced
them to grapple with the trade off.

438
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:36,990
For example, if your manager
comes to you and asks you to do x,

439
00:27:36,991 --> 00:27:40,230
you can respond with, yes, I'm
happy to make this the priority.

440
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:44,910
Which of these other projects should I
de prioritize to pay attention to this

441
00:27:44,911 --> 00:27:45,744
new project?

442
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:51,410
Or simply say I would want to do a great
job and given my other commitments,

443
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:55,710
I wouldn't be able to do a job I
was proud of. If I took this on,

444
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:00,090
I know a leader who received
this response from a subordinate.

445
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:04,650
There was no way he wanted
to be responsible for
disrupting this productive and

446
00:28:04,651 --> 00:28:05,700
organized employee,

447
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,770
so he took the nonessential work project
back and gave it to someone else who

448
00:28:10,771 --> 00:28:15,030
was less organized.
Six say it with humor.

449
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:20,010
I recently was asked by a friend to
join him in training for a marathon.

450
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,740
My response was simple. Nope. He laughed
a little and said, ah, you practice.

451
00:28:25,741 --> 00:28:26,574
What you preach.

452
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:30,900
Just goes to show how useful it is to
have a reputation as an essentialist.

453
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:36,600
Seven use the words
you are welcome to ECS.

454
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:41,820
I am willing to why for example,
you are welcome to borrow my car.

455
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,770
I'm willing to make sure
the keys are here for you.

456
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,280
By this you are also saying
I won't be able to drive you.

457
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,200
You are saying what you will not do but
you are couching it in terms of what you

458
00:28:52,201 --> 00:28:53,070
are willing to do.

459
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,000
This is a particularly good
way to navigate a request
you would like to support

460
00:28:59,041 --> 00:29:01,830
somewhat but cannot throw
your full weight behind.

461
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:07,710
I particularly like this construct because
it also expresses a respect for the

462
00:29:07,711 --> 00:29:10,410
other person's ability to
choose as well as your own.

463
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:13,140
It reminds both parties
of the choices they have

464
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:18,630
eight I can't do it,
but x might be interested.

465
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:23,160
It is tempting to think that
our help is uniquely invaluable,

466
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:27,300
but often people requesting something
don't really care if we are the ones who

467
00:29:27,301 --> 00:29:31,920
help them as long as they get the help.
Kay Krill,

468
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:37,130
the CEO of an Inc Aka Ann Taylor and
loft women's clothing retailers used to

469
00:29:40,051 --> 00:29:44,560
have a terrible time saying no to
social invitations. As a result,

470
00:29:44,561 --> 00:29:47,920
she would end up at networking events.
She had no interest in attending.

471
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,420
She would find herself going to office
parties and regretting it the moment she

472
00:29:52,421 --> 00:29:55,300
got there.
Then one day,

473
00:29:55,301 --> 00:29:59,410
one of her mentors came to her and told
her that she had to learn to jettison

474
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:04,330
the people and things of her life that
just didn't matter and that doing so

475
00:30:04,331 --> 00:30:08,620
would allow her to put 100% of her energy
into the things that had meaningful

476
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:11,380
her.
That advice liberated her.

477
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:16,180
Now she is able to pick and choose
with practice politely declining.

478
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:19,750
An invitation has become easy for her.
K explains,

479
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:23,620
I say no very easily because I
know what is important to me.

480
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:27,550
I only wish that I learned how
to do that earlier in my life.

481
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,240
Saying no is its own
leadership capability.

482
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:36,650
It is not just a peripheral skill.
As with any ability,

483
00:30:36,651 --> 00:30:40,100
we start with limited experience.
We are novices at no.

484
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:45,920
Then we learn a couple of
basic techniques. We make
mistakes, we learn from them,

485
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,550
we develop more skills.
We keep practicing.

486
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:55,160
After a while we have a whole repertoire
available at our disposal and in time

487
00:30:55,161 --> 00:30:58,490
we have gained mastery of
a type of social art form.

488
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:03,560
We can handle almost any request from
almost anybody with grace and dignity.

489
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:09,020
Tom [inaudible], the former CEO of
Heidrick and struggles once said to me,

490
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:12,770
we need to learn the slow
yes and the quick no.

491
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:21,450
Chapter 12 uncommit win
big by cutting your losses.

492
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:28,870
Half of the troubles of this life can
be traced to saying yes too quickly and

493
00:31:28,871 --> 00:31:32,440
not saying no soon enough.
Josh billings

494
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,350
by any estimation.

495
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:41,800
The Concorde jet was a
striking achievement in
aeronautical engineering aboard

496
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,520
this passenger plane.

497
00:31:43,521 --> 00:31:47,060
You could fly from London to New
York in as little as two hours,

498
00:31:47,061 --> 00:31:49,430
52 minutes and 59 seconds.

499
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:54,740
That's less than half the time of a
traditional plain making the Concorde,

500
00:31:54,741 --> 00:31:59,180
the fastest passenger plane in the world.
Unfortunately,

501
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:03,860
it was also an extraordinary
financial failure. Of course,

502
00:32:03,861 --> 00:32:06,290
many great ideas,
innovations and products are,

503
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:11,270
but what made this one different was
that it consistently lost money for more

504
00:32:11,271 --> 00:32:15,380
than four decades.
Yet each time it went over budget,

505
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:19,520
the French and British governments
poured more and more money in.

506
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:24,890
They did this even knowing that the
chance of recouping their continued

507
00:32:24,891 --> 00:32:25,760
investments,

508
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:30,710
let alone the original expenditures
were minuscule with the planes,

509
00:32:30,711 --> 00:32:35,030
limited seating, few orders coming
in, and the high cost of production.

510
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:38,150
It was clear that even
with exaggerated estimates,

511
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,510
the project would be profitable.
Indeed,

512
00:32:41,511 --> 00:32:45,260
when the British cabinet papers were
released under the 30 year rule,

513
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:49,940
they revealed that government ministers
at the time knew the investment could

514
00:32:49,941 --> 00:32:54,890
not stand on normal economic grounds.
Why would intelligent,

515
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:59,090
capable British and French government
officials continued to invest in what was

516
00:32:59,091 --> 00:33:01,280
clearly a losing proposition for so long.

517
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:07,120
One reason is a very common psychological
phenomenon called sunk cost bias.

518
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:13,760
Sunk cost bias is the tendency
to continue to invest time,

519
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:14,510
money,

520
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:19,510
or energy into something we know is a
losing proposition simply because we have

521
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:24,680
already incurred or sunk a
cost that cannot be recouped.

522
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:30,260
But of course this can easily become
a vicious cycle. The more we invest,

523
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:34,970
the more determined we become to see it
through and see our investment pay off.

524
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:39,110
The more we invest in something,
the harder it is to let go.

525
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:45,320
The sunk costs for developing and building
the Concorde were around $1 billion.

526
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:46,810
Yeah,

527
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:49,780
yeah. The more money the British and
French governments poured into it,

528
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:51,730
the harder it was to walk away.

529
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:56,110
Individuals are equally
vulnerable to sunk cost bias.

530
00:33:56,950 --> 00:34:01,210
It explains why we'll continue to sit
through a terrible movie because we've

531
00:34:01,211 --> 00:34:02,740
already paid the price of a ticket.

532
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:07,780
It explains why we continue to pour
money into a home renovation that never

533
00:34:07,781 --> 00:34:09,070
seems to near completion.

534
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:14,710
It explains why we will continue to wait
for a bus or a subway train that never

535
00:34:14,711 --> 00:34:19,711
comes instead of hailing a cab and
it explains why we invest in toxic

536
00:34:19,961 --> 00:34:23,500
relationships even when our
efforts only make things worse.

537
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,930
Examples like this abound.

538
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:31,480
Consider this somewhat bizarre story of
a man named Henry Gribbon who recently

539
00:34:31,481 --> 00:34:36,481
spent his entire life savings $2,600 in
total at a carnival game trying to win

540
00:34:38,231 --> 00:34:41,470
an oversize banana.
The more he spent,

541
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:45,580
the more determined he
became to when Henry said,

542
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:48,790
you just get caught up in the hole.
I've got to win my money back.

543
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:50,710
But it didn't turn out that way.

544
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:55,300
The more he invested in trying to
win this utterly non essential item,

545
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,370
the harder it was for him to walk away.

546
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,530
Have you ever continued to invest time
or effort in a nonessential project

547
00:35:02,531 --> 00:35:03,820
instead of cutting your losses?

548
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:08,530
Have you ever continued to pour money
into an investment that wasn't panning out

549
00:35:08,531 --> 00:35:09,730
instead of walking away?

550
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:14,020
Have you ever kept plodding down a
dead end because you could not admit,

551
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:19,330
I shouldn't have pursued this direction
in the first place ever been stuck in a

552
00:35:19,331 --> 00:35:22,030
cycle of throwing good money after bad.

553
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:27,850
A nonessentialist can't break free of
traps like bees and essentially list has

554
00:35:28,271 --> 00:35:33,271
the courage and confidence to admit his
or her mistakes and uncommit no matter

555
00:35:33,461 --> 00:35:37,260
the sunk costs.
A nonessentialist asks,

556
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:42,470
why stop now when I've already invested
so much in this project and essential

557
00:35:42,601 --> 00:35:46,080
list asks, if I weren't already
invested in this project,

558
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:47,760
how much would I invest in it?

559
00:35:47,761 --> 00:35:52,470
Now in nonessentialist
thinks if I just keep trying,

560
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:53,670
I can make this work

561
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:55,250
okay

562
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:56,390
and essentially stinks.

563
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:00,350
What else could I do with this
time or money if I pulled the plug?

564
00:36:00,351 --> 00:36:05,351
Now a nonessentialist hates admitting
to mistakes and essential list is

565
00:36:07,071 --> 00:36:11,030
comfortable with cutting losses,
sunk cost bias,

566
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:15,320
while all too common isn't the only
nonessentialist trap to watch out for.

567
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:20,390
Below are several other common traps
and tips for how to extricate yourself

568
00:36:20,391 --> 00:36:23,180
politely, gracefully,
and with minimal cost.

569
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:30,390
Avoiding commitment traps.
Beware of the endowment effect.

570
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:36,590
A sense of ownership is a powerful thing.
As the saying goes,

571
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:40,280
nobody in the history of the
world has washed their rental car.

572
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:43,580
This is because of something
called the endowment effect.

573
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:49,010
Our tendency to undervalue things that
aren't ours and to overvalue things

574
00:36:49,011 --> 00:36:50,300
because we already own them.

575
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:55,040
In one study demonstrating the
power of the endowment effect,

576
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,110
the Nobel Prize winning researcher,

577
00:36:57,111 --> 00:37:01,790
Daniel Conaman and colleagues randomly
gave coffee mugs to only half the

578
00:37:01,791 --> 00:37:03,080
subjects in an experiment.

579
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:07,670
The first group was asked how much they
would be willing to sell them Mug for

580
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:11,270
while the second group was asked what
they would be willing to pay for it.

581
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:15,890
It turned out that the students who owned
the mugs refuse to sell for less than

582
00:37:15,891 --> 00:37:18,920
$5 and 25 cents.
While those went out,

583
00:37:18,921 --> 00:37:23,921
the cups were willing to pay only
$2 and 25 cents to $2 and 75 cents.

584
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:25,360
Okay.

585
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,670
The mere fact of ownership,
in other words,

586
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:32,110
caused the McGowan is to value the
objects more highly and made them less

587
00:37:32,111 --> 00:37:35,380
willing to part with
them in your own life.

588
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:38,620
I'm sure you can think of items
that seem to be more valuable.

589
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:40,660
The moment you think
about giving them away.

590
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:45,670
Think of a book on your shelf you haven't
read in years or a kitchen appliance

591
00:37:45,671 --> 00:37:49,510
still sitting in the box or the
sweater you got from aunt Mildred,

592
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:54,400
but never wore whether or not you
get any use or enjoyment out of them

593
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,450
subconsciously.

594
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:59,620
The very fact that they are yours makes
you value the more highly than you would

595
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:03,100
if they didn't belong to you.
Unfortunately,

596
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:07,330
we have this bias when it comes
to nonessential activities
as well as belongings.

597
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:12,850
The project that isn't getting anywhere
at work seems that much more critical

598
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,380
when we're the team leader on it.

599
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:19,690
The commitment to volunteer at the local
bake sale becomes harder to get out of

600
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:22,270
when we're the one who put
the fundraiser together.

601
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:26,950
When we feel we own an activity,
it becomes harder to uncommit.

602
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:32,520
Nonetheless, here is a useful
tip. Pretend you don't own it yet.

603
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:37,660
Tom Stafford describes a simple
antidote to the endowment effect.

604
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:40,780
Instead of asking how
much do I value this item,

605
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:45,490
we should ask if I did not own this item,
how much would I pay to obtain it?

606
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:50,290
We can do the same for opportunities
and commitment. Don't ask,

607
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:53,260
how will I feel if I miss
out on this opportunity,

608
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:56,350
but rather if I did not
have this opportunity,

609
00:38:56,530 --> 00:39:01,390
how much would I be willing to sacrifice
in order to obtain it? Similarly,

610
00:39:01,391 --> 00:39:04,810
we can ask if I wasn't already
involved in this project,

611
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,760
how hard would I work to get on it?

612
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:08,790
Yeah,

613
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:12,480
get over the fear of waste.
How Arcs,

614
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:17,550
a professor of psychology at Ohio State
University who studies judgment in

615
00:39:17,551 --> 00:39:20,400
decision making was puzzled by an enigma.

616
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:26,400
Why are adults so much more vulnerable to
the sunk cost bias than young children?

617
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:32,300
The answer he believes a
lifetime to exposure to the
don't waste rule so that by

618
00:39:33,271 --> 00:39:34,560
the time we are adults,

619
00:39:34,561 --> 00:39:38,310
we are trained to avoid appearing
wasteful even to ourselves.

620
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:43,080
Abandoning a project that you've invested
a lot in fields like you've wasted

621
00:39:43,081 --> 00:39:46,320
everything and waste is
something we're told to avoid.

622
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:49,350
Oc said to illustrate this,

623
00:39:49,351 --> 00:39:52,230
he gave the following scenario
to a group of participants,

624
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:57,810
assumed that you have spent $100 on a
ticket for a weekend ski trip to Michigan.

625
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:03,090
Several weeks later you buy a $50 ticket
for a weekend ski trip to Wisconsin.

626
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:08,070
You think you will enjoy the Wisconsin
ski trip more than the Michigan ski trip.

627
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,690
As you are putting your newly purchased
Wisconsin ticket in your wallet,

628
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:17,780
you notice that the Michigan ski trip and
the Wisconsin Ski trip up for the same

629
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:21,300
weekend, it's too late to
sell or attorney the ticket.

630
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:24,060
You must choose which to use.

631
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:28,020
When asked which ski trip will you go on?

632
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:31,590
More than half said they would
opt for the more expensive trip,

633
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:35,430
even though they would enjoy it less.
They're faulty.

634
00:40:35,431 --> 00:40:39,870
Reasoning was that using the cheaper
ticket would be wasting more money than

635
00:40:39,871 --> 00:40:41,280
using the expensive ticket.

636
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:46,740
It's natural not to want to let go
of what we wasted on a bad choice,

637
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:51,210
but when we don't,
we do myselves to keep wasting even more.

638
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:55,860
Instead,
admit failure to begin success.

639
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:01,110
I remember a friend who would never stop
to ask for directions because he could

640
00:41:01,111 --> 00:41:02,340
never admit he was lost,

641
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:07,680
so we would waste time and energy driving
around in circles, getting nowhere,

642
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,500
the epitome of a nonessential activity.

643
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:15,090
Only when we admit we have made a
mistake and committing to something,

644
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:19,680
can we make a mistake of part of
our past when we remain in denial?

645
00:41:19,681 --> 00:41:22,320
On the other hand,
we continue to circle pointlessly.

646
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:26,370
There should be no shame in
admitting to a mistake after all,

647
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:30,570
we really are only admitting that
we are now wiser than we once were.

648
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:32,690
Yeah,

649
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:34,250
stop to force a fit

650
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:36,950
in the movie.
Tootsie.

651
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,820
Dustin Hoffman plays a struggling
actor who was trying to get work.

652
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:46,750
The movie begins comically with a series
of failed auditions at one he is told

653
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:51,050
we need someone a little older.
At the next year's told,

654
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:54,470
we're looking for someone younger.
Then at the next,

655
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:58,190
you're the wrong height to which
she responds, I can be taller.

656
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:02,630
The executive responds, no, we're
looking for somebody shorter,

657
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:06,950
desperate to make it work.
Hoffman's character explains, look,

658
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:09,950
I don't have to be this tall.
See I'm wearing lifts.

659
00:42:09,951 --> 00:42:14,540
I can be shorter for the
executive also insists. I know,

660
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:19,010
but we're looking for somebody different,
still persistent.

661
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:22,280
The would be apt to pushes back again,
I can be different.

662
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:27,620
The point is that we often act like
Dustin Hoffman's character by trying too

663
00:42:27,621 --> 00:42:32,330
hard to be something we're not, whether
in our personal or professional lives.

664
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:36,470
It is all too tempting to force
something that is simply a mismatch.

665
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:41,150
The solution
get a neutral second opinion.

666
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:46,490
When we get so emotionally hung up on
trying to force something that is not the

667
00:42:46,491 --> 00:42:49,820
right fit, we can often
benefit from a sounding board,

668
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:55,100
someone who is not emotionally involved
in the situation and unaffected by the

669
00:42:55,101 --> 00:42:59,180
choice we make can give us the permission
to stop forcing something that is

670
00:42:59,181 --> 00:43:00,530
clearly not working out.

671
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:05,870
I once wasted months of effort trying
to force a project that just wasn't

672
00:43:05,871 --> 00:43:10,340
working out. Looking back, the more I
put into it, the worst things became,

673
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:14,060
but my irrational response
was to invest still more.

674
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:16,670
I thought I can make this work.

675
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:20,660
I did not want to accept I
had been wasting my effort.

676
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:25,460
I finally shared my frustration with a
friend who had the advantage of being

677
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:27,590
emotionally removed from the project,

678
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:32,150
someone who wasn't burdened with the sunk
costs and could evaluate my decisions

679
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:35,600
with some perspective.
After listening to me he said,

680
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:40,550
you're not married to this and with those
simple words I was liberated to stop

681
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:43,790
investing in a nonessential,
okay

682
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:46,420
be aware of the status quo bias,

683
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:51,820
the tendency to continue doing something
simply because we have always done it

684
00:43:52,450 --> 00:43:54,550
is sometimes called the status quo bias.

685
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:59,530
I once worked at a company that used an
employee evaluation system that seemed

686
00:43:59,531 --> 00:44:03,940
to me so woefully outdated that I became
curious about how long it had been in

687
00:44:03,941 --> 00:44:07,660
place as I searched for
its creator in the company.

688
00:44:07,690 --> 00:44:12,190
I found that nobody up to and including
the longstanding head of HR knew of its

689
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:16,930
origin more shocking. Still in the
10 years she had been at the company,

690
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:18,910
nobody had once questioned the system.

691
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:24,640
It's all too easy to blindly accept
and not bother to question commitments

692
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:29,590
simply because they have already been
established. One cure for the status quo.

693
00:44:29,591 --> 00:44:32,010
Bias is borrowed from world of accounting

694
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:35,400
applies zero based budgeting.

695
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:39,450
Typically when accountants
allocate a budget,

696
00:44:39,451 --> 00:44:43,530
they use last year's budget as the
baseline for the next year's projection,

697
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:48,420
but with zero based budgeting
they use zero as the baseline.

698
00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:53,700
In other words, every item in the proposed
budget must be justified from scratch.

699
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:57,780
While this takes more effort,
it has many advantages.

700
00:44:58,350 --> 00:45:02,850
It efficiently allocates resources on
the basis of needs rather than history.

701
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:06,330
It detects exaggerated budget requests.

702
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:12,050
It draws attention to obsolete operations
and it encourages people to be clear

703
00:45:12,051 --> 00:45:16,080
in their purpose and how their
expenses aligned to that project.

704
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:21,660
You can apply zero based budgeting to
your own endeavors instead of trying to

705
00:45:21,661 --> 00:45:24,480
budget your time on the basis
of existing commitments.

706
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:28,980
Assume that all bets are off.
All previous commitments are gone.

707
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:33,210
Then begin from scratch asking
which you would add today.

708
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:37,830
You can do this with everything from
the financial obligations you have to

709
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:41,280
project. You are committed to
even relationships you are in.

710
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:47,220
Every use of time, energy or
resources has to justify itself a new.

711
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:50,670
If it no longer fits,
eliminated altogether.

712
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,550
Stop making casual commitments.

713
00:45:55,870 --> 00:45:59,890
Some people's days are full to the brim
with soft commitments they have taken on

714
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:04,150
unintentionally through an offhand
comment or casual conversation they had

715
00:46:04,151 --> 00:46:06,790
somewhere with someone you know the kind,

716
00:46:06,791 --> 00:46:10,300
I mean you're chatting with your
neighbor about her work on the PTA,

717
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:14,350
your colleague about a new initiative
she is heading up or your friend about a

718
00:46:14,351 --> 00:46:19,060
new restaurant he wants to try and
before you know it, boom, your committed

719
00:46:20,590 --> 00:46:25,270
from now on. Pause before you
speak. It might sound obvious,

720
00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:29,740
but pausing for just five seconds before
offering your services can greatly

721
00:46:29,741 --> 00:46:34,741
reduce the possibility of making a
commitment you'll regret before the words.

722
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:40,360
That sounds great. I'd love to fly
out of your mouth. Ask Yourself,

723
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:45,400
is this essential? If you've
already made a casual commitment,

724
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:48,580
you're regretting find a nice
way to worm your way out.

725
00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:52,840
Simply apologize and tell the person the
when you made the commitment you didn't

726
00:46:52,841 --> 00:46:54,580
fully realize what it would entail.

727
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:56,580
Okay.

728
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:58,410
Get over the fear of missing out.

729
00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:04,140
We've seen ample evidence in this chapter
suggesting that the majority of us are

730
00:47:04,141 --> 00:47:07,530
naturally very loss averse.
As a result,

731
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:11,670
one of the obstacles to and committing
ourselves from a present course is the

732
00:47:11,671 --> 00:47:16,470
fear of missing out on something great
to fight this fear,

733
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:18,030
run a reverse pilot.

734
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:23,520
One of the ideas that has grown popular
in business circles in recent years is

735
00:47:23,521 --> 00:47:24,354
prototyping.

736
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:30,070
Building a prototype or large
scale model allows to test,

737
00:47:30,071 --> 00:47:35,071
run an idea or product without making a
huge investment upfront exactly the same

738
00:47:35,441 --> 00:47:35,921
idea.

739
00:47:35,921 --> 00:47:40,240
It can be used in reverse to eliminate
nonessentials and a relatively low risk

740
00:47:40,241 --> 00:47:42,820
way by running what Daniel Shapiro,

741
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:47,920
a director at linkedin calls a
reverse pilot in a reverse pilot.

742
00:47:47,921 --> 00:47:51,100
You test whether removing
an initiative or activity.

743
00:47:51,101 --> 00:47:54,250
We'll have any negative consequences.
For example,

744
00:47:54,490 --> 00:47:58,360
when an executive I work with took
on a new senior role in the company,

745
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:00,040
he inherited a process.

746
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:04,450
His predecessor had gone to a
huge effort to implement a huge,

747
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:08,860
highly visual reports on a
myriad of subjects produced
for the other executives.

748
00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:09,723
Each week.

749
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:15,370
It consumed enormous energy from his
team and he hypothesized that it was not

750
00:48:15,371 --> 00:48:19,840
adding a great deal of value to the
company. So to test his hypothesis,

751
00:48:19,841 --> 00:48:21,280
he ran a reverse pilot.

752
00:48:22,270 --> 00:48:26,290
He simply stopped publishing the report
and waited to see what the response

753
00:48:26,291 --> 00:48:27,124
would be.

754
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:32,050
What he found was that no one seemed
to miss it after several weeks.

755
00:48:32,051 --> 00:48:35,500
Nobody had even mentioned the report.
As a result,

756
00:48:35,501 --> 00:48:39,040
he concluded that the report was not
essential to the business and could be

757
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:39,874
eliminated.

758
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:45,370
A similar reverse pilot can be carried
out in our social lives are their

759
00:48:45,371 --> 00:48:48,760
commitments you routinely make to
customers, colleagues, friends,

760
00:48:48,761 --> 00:48:52,630
or even family members that you have
always assumed made a big difference to

761
00:48:52,631 --> 00:48:52,901
them,

762
00:48:52,901 --> 00:48:57,901
but that in fact they might barely
notice by quietly eliminating or at least

763
00:48:58,421 --> 00:49:01,420
scaling back in activity
for a few days or weeks.

764
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:05,500
You might be able to assess whether it
is really making a difference or whether

765
00:49:05,501 --> 00:49:09,940
no one really cares.
Even using these techniques.

766
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,650
It's true that [inaudible] can be harder
than simply not committing in the first

767
00:49:14,651 --> 00:49:15,484
place.

768
00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:20,350
We feel guilty saying no to something
or someone we have already committed to

769
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:24,910
and let's face it,
no one likes going back on their word yet.

770
00:49:24,911 --> 00:49:29,380
Learning how to do so in ways that were
Ghana. You respect for your courage,

771
00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:33,530
focus and discipline is crucial
to becoming an essentialist.

772
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:38,950
Hey guys, this is Tim again. Just a
few more things before you take off.

773
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,950
Number one,
this is five bullet Friday.

774
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:45,220
Do you want to get a short email from me?

775
00:49:45,221 --> 00:49:49,360
Would you enjoy getting a short email
from me every Friday that provides a

776
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:52,900
little more soul of fun before the
weekend and five bullet Friday is a very

777
00:49:52,901 --> 00:49:57,250
short email where I share the coolest
things I've found or that I've been

778
00:49:57,251 --> 00:49:58,570
pondering over the week.

779
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:01,540
That could include favorite new
albums that I've discovered.

780
00:50:01,541 --> 00:50:05,020
It could include Gizmos and gadgets
and all sorts of weird shit that I've

781
00:50:05,021 --> 00:50:09,310
somehow dug up in the, uh, the
world of the esoteric as I do.

782
00:50:09,610 --> 00:50:14,610
It could include favorite articles that
I've read and that I've shared with my

783
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,980
close friends for instance.
And it's very short.

784
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:23,050
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness
before you head off for the weekend.

785
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:25,300
So if you want to receive that,

I hope you enjoyed,

789
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:39,470
this episode is brought
to you by four sigmatic.

790
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:42,290
You might remember four sigmatic
for their mushroom coffee,

791
00:50:42,350 --> 00:50:45,110
which was created by those
clever finished founders.

792
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:47,930
And when I first mentioned
that coffee on this podcast,

793
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:51,410
the product sold out in less than a week.
It lights you up like a Christmas tree,

794
00:50:51,411 --> 00:50:53,930
which can be really useful.
However,

795
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:58,370
recently I've been testing the opposite
side of the spectrum of new product and

796
00:50:58,371 --> 00:51:03,170
that is their Reishi mushroom elixir
to help me end my day to get to sleep.

797
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:06,110
As you guys may know,
longtime listeners,

798
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:09,770
at least I struggled with insomnia for
decades. I've a largely fixed that,

799
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:12,890
but still shutting off my monkey
brain has never been easy.

800
00:51:12,910 --> 00:51:15,650
It's still isn't easy very often.
And I found Reishi,

801
00:51:15,651 --> 00:51:19,040
which I've been fascinated by for
a few years now, has been very,

802
00:51:19,041 --> 00:51:22,940
very effective and calming
their old formula. However,

803
00:51:22,941 --> 00:51:27,800
four sigmatic old formula included
Stevia and I like to avoid sweeteners,

804
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:32,890
all sweeteners for a host of reasons
and I then just ping them and asked,

805
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:38,390
hey guys, I would love to experiment
with this and maybe actually suggested,

806
00:51:38,450 --> 00:51:41,840
but I'd like a version without
sweeteners if you'd be open to it,

807
00:51:41,950 --> 00:51:43,130
if too much of a headache,
don't worry.

808
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:47,270
And they are always game
for experimentation.

809
00:51:47,310 --> 00:51:50,990
So they created a special custom version
without the Stevia, without sweeteners.

810
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:53,540
Now it is part of my nightly routine.

811
00:51:54,050 --> 00:51:56,660
Their ratio looks or comes
in single serving packets,

812
00:51:56,661 --> 00:51:58,280
which are perfect for travel.
And in fact,

813
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:01,160
I'm about to leave the country right
now and I have a packet in front of me

814
00:52:01,170 --> 00:52:04,640
that's just going to sit in
the end of my carry on bag.

815
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:08,600
You only need hot water and it mixes very,
very easily.

816
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:13,400
Here's some recommended copy
that they put in the read.

817
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:16,400
So I'm going to read it and
I'll give you my take quote,

818
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:18,740
a warning for those in
the experimental mindset,

819
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:22,250
Reishi is strong and bitter in
parentheses, like any great medicine.

820
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:23,840
So if the bitterness is too much,

821
00:52:23,841 --> 00:52:28,140
I recommend trying it with honey end or
nut milk such as almond milk and quote.

822
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,290
So I'm going to say,
no,

823
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:34,820
you should suck it up and you should drink
the tea because it's not that bitter.

824
00:52:35,270 --> 00:52:39,050
And maybe should take the advice of all
Chinese people when they're criticizing

825
00:52:39,051 --> 00:52:41,540
younguns when they say
who and I'm sure cool.

826
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:46,550
Which means you're not able to eat
bitterness. Bitter is in many cases,

827
00:52:46,551 --> 00:52:50,120
an indication of things that help
liver detoxification and so on.

828
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:51,920
Not saying that's the case here,

829
00:52:51,921 --> 00:52:56,720
but I've tested this ratio
lecture on family members,

830
00:52:56,721 --> 00:52:59,180
on friends. Everybody has liked
it. It's a little bit, or have the,

831
00:52:59,181 --> 00:53:02,990
it's not that hard.
So I would just say suck it up and no,

832
00:53:03,050 --> 00:53:07,190
don't put in honey or nut milk or any of
that shit. Just drink the goddamn tea.

833
00:53:07,191 --> 00:53:10,250
It's delicious. I think if you
like who air that kind of stuff,

834
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:13,820
that type of teeth, you're going
to dig it. So just try it. Okay.

835
00:53:13,970 --> 00:53:17,870
Back to then my read. If you'd like
to naturally improve your sleep,

836
00:53:18,470 --> 00:53:19,850
both onset and quality,

837
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:24,880
I think naturally you might just enjoy
this ratio lecture without any sweet

nurse. It has organic Reishi extract,
organic fueled, mint extract,
