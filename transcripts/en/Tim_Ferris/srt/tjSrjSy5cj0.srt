00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,020
Hello friends and family.
I am Kevin Rose.

2
00:00:09,021 --> 00:00:12,440
Welcome to another edition of
the random show. I am Tim Ferris,

3
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:17,000
and also welcome to number
347 of the random show.

4
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:21,370
I am your bald cohost today.
We're twinsies. Yes, yes.

5
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:25,010
We decide to go for a little shave.
Nice. I think it's very a suiting.

6
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:27,140
It feels very flattering.
Really. You think so?

7
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,080
Your head is bigger than it's like
William Shatner. No, it's not.

8
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,460
Our heads are the same size by the way.
We measured them.

9
00:00:33,461 --> 00:00:37,580
We measure this conference of our
heads and they're actually also match.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,020
Daria says waste. Oh, that's
right. My wife's waste is the same.

11
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,810
That's kind of weird. Why don't we hit
what the, yeah. One night he came over,

12
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:47,760
we did that and we know where are
we right now? We're in the it.

13
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:50,840
This is this how the man cave?
Is that the man cave?

14
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,830
This is just my office at my house and uh,

15
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:55,400
I've got a little
chalkboard behind this ear.

16
00:00:55,401 --> 00:00:59,240
So sometimes when we're doing a little
product brainstorming sessions with a few

17
00:00:59,241 --> 00:01:02,420
of my coworkers, I'm on absolutely
want to build stuff like that.

18
00:01:02,421 --> 00:01:05,390
We get up here and move the
couch away and just light board.

19
00:01:05,391 --> 00:01:07,490
I think this was for tiny back in the day,

20
00:01:07,491 --> 00:01:11,900
one of the absolute built about eight
months ago. And yeah, it's all tiny.

21
00:01:11,901 --> 00:01:14,690
So I haven't touched this.
We got an office so we don't use as much.

22
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,220
And you have sort of an art deco,
uh,

23
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:22,160
metallics are stainless steel chandelier,

24
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:26,970
which used to be deer antlers.
Did you swap it out? Honestly,

25
00:01:26,971 --> 00:01:30,110
this, this whole room used
to be very like man cave. He,

26
00:01:30,111 --> 00:01:32,440
like you said initially
where it was a dark leather,

27
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,990
it's a dark leather big desk with leather
on it and stuff. And I'd just like,

28
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:39,160
you know, that was my dad. That was
kind of like what he liked, you know,

29
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,510
and I wanted to make it seem
kind of Woodsy, which is fine,

30
00:01:41,511 --> 00:01:44,990
but I just wanted a little bit more space
and something a little bit more modern

31
00:01:44,991 --> 00:01:47,560
and that's why I got this
couch and I don't know. Um,

32
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:51,320
so it's kind of turned into this area
where now my desks off against the wall.

33
00:01:51,321 --> 00:01:54,320
I've got a bunch of open space in front
of me. I can just come into your lounge.

34
00:01:54,321 --> 00:01:56,810
I got a little aims chair there
that can kick back and read a book,

35
00:01:56,811 --> 00:02:00,380
something like that. So it's going to,
and you have a lot of whiskey. What?

36
00:02:00,381 --> 00:02:03,160
Japanese whiskey. So what
are you drinking today? Um,

37
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:07,730
I just got back from Tokyo here a couple
of weeks ago and this is a whiskey that

38
00:02:07,731 --> 00:02:11,300
they have yet to release in
the United States. It's um,

39
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:16,490
they're Hibiki harmony whiskey and so
it is a blend of I think four different

40
00:02:16,491 --> 00:02:19,760
whiskeys. And so he'd beaky is one
of my favorite Japanese whiskeys.

41
00:02:19,761 --> 00:02:24,530
I hadn't thoughti whisky.
Suntory. Yeah. Um, so I have a,

42
00:02:24,531 --> 00:02:29,400
I have the 21, the 30
there. I also have a 12. Um,

43
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,480
honestly I think for a day
to day drinker this blend,

44
00:02:32,481 --> 00:02:36,200
I'm not sure what it would retail for in
the states when it does eventually get

45
00:02:36,201 --> 00:02:40,800
here in Japan, I think it was 99
or 100 bucks for a model. Got It.

46
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:45,780
So nothing crazy expensive. Um, for our
daily Swig. Yep. This is just a, it's,

47
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:49,580
it's when you're drinking the age
whiskeys there, they're very deep.

48
00:02:49,581 --> 00:02:53,000
That will a lot of depth to them and
a lot of complexity when they hit your

49
00:02:53,001 --> 00:02:57,820
tongue. This is just mild chill. Like
you can just kick back on a nice level,

50
00:02:57,821 --> 00:02:58,790
a nice sunny day.

51
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:01,630
Throw a big cube in there and don't feel
like you're killing it. Cause it's like,

52
00:03:01,631 --> 00:03:05,660
you know it doesn't, it doesn't. You
know how when you do proper age whiskey,

53
00:03:05,661 --> 00:03:06,670
you don't want to dilute it down to,

54
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:11,470
I just feel like you have
to be too precious. Exactly.
Now if you have those Sam,

55
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,550
I'll try it a little. He's not drinking
right now. Good deal. Don't think sip.

56
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:19,120
Take a sip. I'm not going to
fake. Sometimes you fake sip.

57
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:23,230
Just take a little sip. But any
seen you fake sip? I don't know.

58
00:03:23,231 --> 00:03:25,750
Sometimes you don't drink that much.
Well that's true.

59
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,720
Meaning I don't drink as
much as Kevin Rose. Listen,

60
00:03:28,721 --> 00:03:32,830
I don't drink as much as well. I guess
a decent amount, but not that much.

61
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:38,380
I don't drink as much as I am and
leaving Las Vegas. Oh wait. Yeah.

62
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:38,820
Hey listen.

63
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,400
I've been tracking my drinks as we
mentioned in a previous episode in that

64
00:03:41,401 --> 00:03:44,460
spreadsheet. How's that gum? I don't
drink that much. I drink a little bit,

65
00:03:44,461 --> 00:03:47,720
but not that much. Five or six
drinks a night? No, no, no, no, no.

66
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,380
That would be insane.
I was like alcoholic level,

67
00:03:49,381 --> 00:03:54,381
like I would say an average night for
me is probably like 1.75 all right.

68
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,990
Meaning there's some nights where I had
three glasses and there's some nights

69
00:03:57,991 --> 00:03:58,810
where I have zero

70
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:03,810
are using fishbowls as glasses because
I know I've told my readers before you

71
00:04:04,481 --> 00:04:07,420
can have one glass of red wine
at night and they find out all,

72
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:12,450
they figured out all sorts of creative
ways to basically make self-defeating

73
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,000
decisions to drink out of like a fishbowl.

74
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:18,840
So Darren's think I'm kind of, I
think some kind of nut nuts. My wife,

75
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:23,100
because I'll come in and I'll actually
measure out the ounces of wine into the

76
00:04:23,101 --> 00:04:27,480
glass to make sure I get the rapport.
Because before I was like, oh,

77
00:04:27,481 --> 00:04:31,190
there's like three classes
per bottle of wine or four,

78
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,460
but I think it's actually like
four and a half or is that

79
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,330
all right? 750 mil. Yeah. So anyway,

80
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,090
you have to be,

81
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:42,850
I've also, I've been measuring it
out if I get kind of crazy, but I'm,

82
00:04:42,851 --> 00:04:44,140
I'm loosening up on
that stuff a little bit.

83
00:04:44,141 --> 00:04:46,720
It was fun to track it for the
first few months and I still am,

84
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,540
but I don't know what the
goal is at this point.

85
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:52,120
Like I know how much I drink and
I'm pretty comfortable where I'm at.

86
00:04:52,121 --> 00:04:55,930
I'd like to look into push, push the
envelope a little up, up at four or five.

87
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,110
This is interesting.
I want to talk about scaling back on,

88
00:04:59,111 --> 00:05:01,780
on this kind of stuff because
for me as we get older,

89
00:05:01,781 --> 00:05:04,270
I'm approaching 40 you're approaching 40.

90
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,110
Like we look good to think about that.

91
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:11,050
While I was going to say 50 blending will
be butterflyed up. Um, we, we like, you know,

92
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,700
fat sticks to us a lot easier.

93
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:16,690
And actually we had dinner a couple
nights ago and you're on this really funky

94
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:19,760
thing, love Funky, but it's like
different than your four our bodies,

95
00:05:19,761 --> 00:05:23,140
stuff like that for a sec. Yeah. I'm doing

96
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,810
and falling what's called
the key to genic diet.

97
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,510
[inaudible] so I'm in a ketonic state.
What does that mean?

98
00:05:28,511 --> 00:05:32,080
That means that I am running
on fat predominantly.

99
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:35,470
So my fuel is coming from fat,
my fuel's coming from fat.

100
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:40,830
And what that means in pragmatic terms
is that I am eating probably 80% of my

101
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:47,080
calories or so from fat, which is a
lot harder to do than you might think.

102
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:47,741
Uh,

103
00:05:47,741 --> 00:05:52,741
and then perhaps 15% from protein
and 5% or less from carbohydrates.

104
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:58,100
And I'm doing experiments to see
what knocks me out of or not.

105
00:05:58,101 --> 00:06:01,160
And the way that you actually just tips,
take a step back.

106
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:06,400
If you were to crash in a
plan and the flying tomorrow,

107
00:06:06,531 --> 00:06:09,940
where are you saying? Right. So let's
just say that you crash and you're,

108
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,480
you're stuck in the wilderness.
Hold on.

109
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:16,340
You can survive three hours without
shelter. Three days without water,

110
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:19,670
three weeks without food. Okay. So you
can go without food for a long time.

111
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:23,840
What happens when initially your
brain's going to be trying to work,

112
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:24,771
uh,

113
00:06:24,771 --> 00:06:29,330
utilizing glucose and blood sugar and
over time that's going to become untenable

114
00:06:29,331 --> 00:06:31,100
because you're not
consuming carbohydrates.

115
00:06:31,101 --> 00:06:33,530
And then we'll start pulling it from
the muscles and the liver and so on.

116
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:38,740
Eventually you run out and that's when
your body kicks over into utilizing body

117
00:06:38,901 --> 00:06:41,960
fat for fuel and
converting it into ketones.

118
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,130
So ketone bodies can be processed by
the brain and heart really, really well,

119
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:50,690
actually. They're very helpful
for endurance exercise.
So is this good for you?

120
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:51,530
Like is it,

121
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:54,980
I heard this a mental fog that happens
when you first started going into it.

122
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:58,860
A transition from glucose
dependent, a ketone, uh,

123
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:02,930
adapted or Keto adapted
can produce some fog,

124
00:07:02,931 --> 00:07:05,960
but it doesn't have to last
more than a day or two.

125
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,120
But for a lot of people it'll take
four or five days to get there.

126
00:07:08,121 --> 00:07:12,260
This is essentially the Atkins
diet more or less, right?
Yeah, yeah, exactly. And, uh,

127
00:07:12,261 --> 00:07:17,240
so this is a new toy that I've been
playing with, so it's not quite a toy,

128
00:07:17,241 --> 00:07:20,930
but it's a a, it's a medical
device called the precision Xtra.

129
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:25,730
And this looks like, and is
a glucometer, meaning I, uh,

130
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:30,260
so I put a needle or you can do
this here. I pop, I hit my finger,

131
00:07:30,261 --> 00:07:31,820
I could do it live.
Maybe I won't do it live.

132
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,510
I've done it on my fingers and it
hurts so bad. Like it can't hurt,

133
00:07:35,511 --> 00:07:36,830
especially if you get,

134
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:41,090
I was measuring and I had been measuring
four times a day and I have two strips

135
00:07:41,091 --> 00:07:44,690
per measurement. So I'm putting eight
sticks in my hand per day, per day.

136
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:48,590
Now I don't recommend that talk to
your medical professional, but, uh,

137
00:07:48,591 --> 00:07:50,930
what's so cool about
this particular device?

138
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,400
Or you can go to Walgreens and buy
all sorts of glucometers leave.

139
00:07:53,401 --> 00:07:55,950
You didn't talk to your medical
professional about your like, Hey,

140
00:07:55,951 --> 00:08:00,170
I'm a stick myself eight times. Let's
say you're a butterflying idiot. There you go.

141
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:04,720
Alright. Dr. Rosa is
delivered the verdict. These,

142
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:10,040
that's a caveat that I provide because
you don't want to get sued. Yeah.

143
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:11,510
Because someone like sick themselves,

144
00:08:11,511 --> 00:08:15,410
one out of every thousand people out there
as a butterflying retard and they're going

145
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:19,940
to be like, oh, Tim said to stick myself.
No, butterflying stab myself in the eye.

146
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,390
All right, so talk to your doctor before
you butterflying stab yourself in the eye. Um,

147
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,410
these,

148
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:28,760
these particular sticks are for
measuring ketone bodies and these are for

149
00:08:28,761 --> 00:08:33,290
glucose, so you can do both
at this device, which is very,
very interesting. And uh,

150
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,150
because previously as you know,
and you have,

151
00:08:35,151 --> 00:08:37,460
I see on your desk some Quito sticks.
Well,

152
00:08:37,461 --> 00:08:39,020
I just got this can throw
them in those grammar,

153
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,550
that little a white bottle gnome in front
of that right there. Yeah. Yeah. Um,

154
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,270
I got this because you started
talking about, and I was like, well,

155
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,870
I'm going to try this for like weeks.
And he was saying like,

156
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:50,380
you lose fat like a
Mofo, like you do. Yeah.

157
00:08:50,381 --> 00:08:52,430
You can have a come cabs
like starting to come out.

158
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:57,431
Now my motto ad is slowly
becoming maybe a drab,

159
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:03,000
we'll move all moving towards a six back.
I've lost a ton of fat and I had some,

160
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,640
I blend my hips apart doing too
and eat too many squats, uh,

161
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:10,830
for just like squatting on a daily basis
for many days straight. And so I, uh,

162
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,820
from ability not for,
for hypertrophy and took two weeks off,

163
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:18,780
had my first workout today and
all of the weights felt light.

164
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,030
And now I'm not saying that's because of
the Diet, but my joints feel incredibly,

165
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:28,350
uh, they feel much better
than they did two weeks ago.

166
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,480
And I've been on the
diet for maybe a week.

167
00:09:30,481 --> 00:09:33,570
I'm going to do another probably four
or five days and do a secondary round of

168
00:09:33,571 --> 00:09:35,400
blood testing. But here's, here's
the thing that's interesting.

169
00:09:35,401 --> 00:09:39,000
When you go into Ketosis, there are
different ways to measure ketosis.

170
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,740
So when you pee on these, you are, you're,

171
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:47,730
what this is detecting is a cdot
acetate being expelled in the urine.

172
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,510
Uh, and this is kind of reliable.
You have a color coding on the side,

173
00:09:51,511 --> 00:09:55,710
which tells you whether you have
negative ketones, trace small,

174
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:59,400
moderate or large. All right Liz.
Then I would rather pee on a stick.

175
00:09:59,401 --> 00:10:01,440
Then you get stab myself eight
times a day. This gets me,

176
00:10:01,441 --> 00:10:05,130
this gives you the millimolar
concentration to keep
ketones, which is very,

177
00:10:05,131 --> 00:10:08,090
very specific. Now the problem
with these, for instance, um,

178
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,480
you could also measure
it with your breath.

179
00:10:09,481 --> 00:10:13,590
There's something called a [inaudible]
device. I think that's what it's called.

180
00:10:13,591 --> 00:10:15,270
Ketonic excuse me,
with an end.

181
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,970
And you breathe into it and
that will measure acetone.

182
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,530
And so it's also more accurate than this.
The Nutanix,

183
00:10:22,531 --> 00:10:25,950
I would say it's more accurate than this
because if you become fat adapted and

184
00:10:25,951 --> 00:10:29,340
you've been in Ketosis for a while, so
let's just say Atkins Diet, whatever, uh,

185
00:10:29,341 --> 00:10:33,480
your body becomes more
efficient at processing ketones
and you won't excrete as

186
00:10:33,481 --> 00:10:34,770
much.
And so you then you'll,

187
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:39,600
you'll pee on this or do you want
to be a little more, uh, reliable?

188
00:10:39,601 --> 00:10:42,630
You can dip it into your
urine for 15 seconds,

189
00:10:42,631 --> 00:10:46,470
pull it out and you might
come up negative. But in fact,

190
00:10:46,471 --> 00:10:47,610
you're rocking and rolling.

191
00:10:47,611 --> 00:10:50,730
It's just that your body is not
experienced with the breathalyzer thing.

192
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:53,760
Catch that. The Breathalyzer, uh,

193
00:10:53,761 --> 00:10:58,761
I don't know how adaptive
the Acetone expulsion is.

194
00:10:59,101 --> 00:11:02,070
I think that that also probably
diminishes over time. If I had to guess.

195
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:05,700
So the holes I,
this was $12 for me at Walgreens.

196
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:09,050
How much does that to the precision
Xtra is not that expensive.

197
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:13,350
You can get it for like 35, 40 bucks
now. But here's the thing. All right,

198
00:11:13,351 --> 00:11:17,780
so that is how much? 12 bucks.
And how many are there? 50.
Yeah. Okay. I know these,

199
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,900
these, these are little strips for
ketones. These are like $5 a pop. Uh,

200
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:26,700
they're really, really expensive. Uh, so
this is cost prohibitive for most people,

201
00:11:26,701 --> 00:11:31,700
especially people who are
as OCD as me with, uh,

202
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:36,240
with sticking themselves three, four
times a day. So that is the story.

203
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,600
So how much is the breathalyzer thing?
Gosh, that test toaster for ketones.

204
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:42,690
Ketones. Why would you hurt my
dog? Not going to hurt your dog.

205
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:45,750
Your dog is getting a little buxom.
He's leaves look a little chunky monkey.

206
00:11:45,751 --> 00:11:48,500
What do you think he's got an extra for?
We haven't him lately.

207
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,440
He's a, I don't want to
send to super cute. Come on.

208
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:59,020
I'm not saying he's fat, he's
just fat her. Uh, what else?

209
00:11:59,021 --> 00:12:01,780
What else is going on? Let's say what
all on how much of the breathalyzer cost?

210
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:06,310
I don't know. I think that's between like
102 hundred bucks. Okay. Yeah. So can we,

211
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:09,250
one thing people are going to be wondering
is like you have a very successful,

212
00:12:09,251 --> 00:12:13,060
for our body book,
it's kind of like this and that.

213
00:12:13,061 --> 00:12:17,890
I'm sure you do kind of go into ketosis
with the foreign body a little, hey,

214
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:22,120
you can go into ketosis on slow carb.
It's not the objective, but it can happen.

215
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:26,680
And I'm logging all of my data secure and
then transferring it over to Evernote.

216
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:29,330
Everyone is wondering, why
are you doing this? Uh,

217
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:33,640
I'm doing it because I constantly
test different diets. Number one.

218
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:35,640
Number two,
you die.

219
00:12:35,641 --> 00:12:38,990
It is selected based on what you're
optimizing for us right now. Uh,

220
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,590
I have some weird blood markers.

221
00:12:41,591 --> 00:12:46,570
My blood tests have a number of items
that have come back really weird and I

222
00:12:46,571 --> 00:12:51,571
want to see if a ketogenic
diet changes that.

223
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:56,290
And I want to see if it's autoimmune
related, if it's food related.

224
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:00,650
And so doing a lot of blood
testing before and after, uh,

225
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,760
for trying to identify,
uh,

226
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:07,090
how tweaking these variables effects
on those things. That's pretty much it.

227
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,910
You said it was making your joints
feel better. This has done is like,

228
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:13,560
is it a antiinflammatory
diet in some sense? Well,

229
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:17,770
in this to the extent that a lot of
people would consider carbohydrates

230
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:22,580
inflammatory, uh, or at least
process carbohydrates are
those that are, that are,

231
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,210
that are converted to glucose
very quickly. Uh, Yep.

232
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,460
Then it would definitely be
considered a antiinflammatory diet.

233
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:28,600
Do you think that's impacting?

234
00:13:28,601 --> 00:13:31,230
You said your joints are feeling
better now that you're on the side be,

235
00:13:31,231 --> 00:13:34,630
it could also be the fact that I'm
consuming 80% of my calories from fat and

236
00:13:34,631 --> 00:13:39,430
eating like coconut oil and cheese
and all this other stuff that, uh,

237
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:43,260
might help lubricate the joints.
And I'm not sure how synovial fluid is,

238
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:47,330
is produced, which is the, the fluid
that you find in say the knee, uh,

239
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:51,730
but feel pretty good. Now on the
flip side, eating all of this fat,

240
00:13:51,731 --> 00:13:54,160
my skin is not so happy.
Big Surprise, right?

241
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:57,610
When you're eating like hunks of
metal using cream and coconut oil.

242
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:03,070
My a year sebaceous glands.
That's what kicks out the uh,

243
00:14:03,071 --> 00:14:07,270
the oil, it causes acne. Uh,
not so happy. Pretty grumpy.

244
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:10,810
So we'll not sure. Not sure. I'll do
this for a super long period of time.

245
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:15,580
I do find slow carb a lot easier,
a lot easier. Uh, and I just had,

246
00:14:15,581 --> 00:14:17,980
for instance, I'm actually going to
test myself while, while we talk,

247
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,740
but I had a lead on my couch.
I'm not going to lead on your couch.

248
00:14:20,741 --> 00:14:25,090
I had a Kombucha while walking over here
that has sugar in it. Well, as a grips,

249
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,160
so over the day I'm trying to,

250
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:31,330
I'm trying to restrain or
constrain, restrict. There we go.

251
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:35,740
We're strict my carbs to 30 grams or
less for the day and I'm trying to,

252
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:41,220
I'm trying to restrict my protein to
around one gram per kilogram of desired

253
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:44,240
body weight or lean body weight.
That's it.

254
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:48,460
Typically the same amount
that bodybuilders eat when
they want to put mass on?

255
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:52,070
No, it's a lot like one
gram per pound, per pound of

256
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,220
body weight I'm doing killed him.

257
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:58,190
It's less than half. Um, and you have
to really restrict your protein intake.

258
00:14:58,191 --> 00:15:01,250
If you eat tons of protein, especially
if you drink something like whey protein,

259
00:15:01,251 --> 00:15:03,170
which is the simple sugar of proteins,

260
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:08,590
it's the liver will convert that via
Gluconeogenesis is what it's called into.

261
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,520
Got the, we've got the scientist
in the background. Give me
the thumbs up, uh, into,

262
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:17,570
uh,
well they'll take,

263
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,590
the amino acids will be converted into
glucose and certain amino acids are

264
00:15:21,591 --> 00:15:23,920
converted preferentially into glucose.
So there,

265
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,890
uh, Glucogenix as opposed
to ketogenic. So anyway,

266
00:15:28,891 --> 00:15:31,890
it's all very, very interesting
stuff. One last question for you.

267
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,980
When you're on this day, can you actually
put on mass? Do you think you could,

268
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,600
if you were lifting,
you'd get bigger?

269
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:41,350
I think it's possible that I could,
but if I were to do it,

270
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,890
if I were to follow this diet and,
and really want to put on mass,

271
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:47,740
I would either follow
what people call the Tkd,

272
00:15:47,741 --> 00:15:51,670
the targeted Ketogenic Diet or what
I've done before when I was in college.

273
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,420
Actually,

274
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:56,770
the cyclical Ketogenic Diet
and the cyclical ketogenic
diet is very interesting

275
00:15:56,771 --> 00:16:00,580
and it combines well with the mentality
and kind of the ethos of the slow carb

276
00:16:00,581 --> 00:16:05,581
Diet because you have 24 to 48 hours each
week to binge basically the carb load.

277
00:16:05,771 --> 00:16:10,510
So you would follow the Ketogenic Diet
from say Monday to Friday on Saturday

278
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:10,850
morning,

279
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:14,860
you'd do a glycogen depletion workout
and then you would carb load for the next

280
00:16:14,861 --> 00:16:18,080
24 to 48 hours. I would
constrain that to 24. Uh,

281
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:22,780
and I think if you do that and you're
taking advantage of insulin is an anabolic

282
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:27,781
hormone and driving carbs in that that
can help fuel you for high intensity

283
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:33,430
workouts for say the next two or three
days when you get super advanced like a

284
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:37,330
Peter, a Tina, uh, who is an MD
that I've had on the podcast.

285
00:16:37,331 --> 00:16:41,710
We've talked about all sorts of life
extension and performance enhancing, uh,

286
00:16:41,711 --> 00:16:44,080
techniques and tools and dietary tweaks.
Uh,

287
00:16:44,081 --> 00:16:48,040
he is a ketosis master so he will
determine he's a, he's in that,

288
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:51,190
he's a long distance cyclist and he also,

289
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:55,810
well actually he wouldn't consider it
longest since he does 20 kilometer time

290
00:16:55,811 --> 00:16:59,770
trials I think is 20
kilometer. And he will, he can,

291
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,370
he will quantify the exact number of
carbohydrates or grams of carbohydrates,

292
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:08,820
carbohydrates a he can consume and utilize
during exercise without popping out

293
00:17:09,191 --> 00:17:09,980
of Ketosis.

294
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:14,480
Hmm. Crazy. Yeah, he does something. He
only eats those carbs when he's cycling.

295
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,340
That's right. And then
when he's done, he's like,

296
00:17:16,341 --> 00:17:18,710
I didn't pop up cause I just burned
everything straight out. Yeah.

297
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:22,430
And he'll measure that based on
what he believes his liver can hold.

298
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:25,820
I think it's something like
400 grams or 400 calories.

299
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,710
I think it's probably 400 calories.
No, maybe 400 grams. I'm mixing him.

300
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:34,400
I'm not this advanced. I'm just
using one of your podcasts. Yeah,

301
00:17:34,401 --> 00:17:37,750
he's been on the podcast twice. Sweet.
I'll go. I'll go listen. Get a Tia. A T,

302
00:17:37,751 --> 00:17:42,290
t I a the guy's amazing. All right.
What else? Uh, so other things,

303
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,940
Tim's doing weird, particularly things
over there. I talked about my whiskey. Um,

304
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:50,940
so this is something that I just
started getting into, uh, last week.

305
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:56,630
And this little guy right here is
called the fresh roast sr 700 sr 700.

306
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:02,340
It's like a fake movie name, Dude. This
is, this is, it's like a, the blackbird,

307
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:07,330
what was that? The SR 71? Uh,
that's right. Yeah. So, um,

308
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:09,750
this is, uh, at home coffee roaster.

309
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:14,490
Like you basically buy the beans,
like straight up green beans.

310
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:19,110
These are coffee beans before they'd
been roasted and you can roast your own

311
00:18:19,111 --> 00:18:23,100
beans inside this little
machine. So essentially what
you do is you fill this up.

312
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,830
If I'm going to make enough
for just one cup of coffee,

313
00:18:25,831 --> 00:18:29,020
I'll put 25 grams of a,

314
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,310
of beans in here and then
put little top on here.

315
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,680
And this will circulate hot air at around,
Oh you,

316
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:40,620
there's three different
temperature settings, but the
high is around 400 degrees,

317
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,600
um, which is pretty hot. Uh,
and it fluffs it like popcorn.

318
00:18:45,601 --> 00:18:47,220
So you'll see these little beans jump.

319
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:51,750
It takes about 10 to 15 minutes and then
you'll have a perfectly roasted coffee.

320
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,210
It'll do a cool down period.
Um,

321
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:58,860
and then you take it out and let it
grind it after it sits and you have fresh

322
00:18:58,861 --> 00:19:00,900
roasted coffee at home. It's
pretty awesome. That's cool.

323
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:03,900
So I mean it's a way to save money but
also at the same time like experimenting

324
00:19:03,901 --> 00:19:06,210
with different types of rows
cause you can do your own rose.

325
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:07,950
How do you like to roast coffee?

326
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,680
Well I just got this thing so
I'm really not that far into it.

327
00:19:10,681 --> 00:19:13,830
But one of the things that's really cool
about this is it has a Usb port on the

328
00:19:13,831 --> 00:19:18,480
back of it and I plugged
it into my computer and you
can go in and set your own

329
00:19:18,481 --> 00:19:22,230
cycles so you can set your
temperature cycles, your
duration, and you can have it.

330
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:26,610
Oh God, I hate it seemed that, that hurts
dude. I do that for vitamin D testing.

331
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:33,090
Um, oh man. So anyway, uh,
check it out. It's on Amazon.

332
00:19:33,091 --> 00:19:36,930
I will say one thing about that coffee
roaster. Um, it's not that expensive,

333
00:19:36,931 --> 00:19:41,310
but there have been some people that
have issues with the roasts are being

334
00:19:41,311 --> 00:19:43,440
broken when they receive it.
Um,

335
00:19:43,441 --> 00:19:46,560
I had a similar issue where my
roaster wasn't getting hot enough.

336
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,050
I did contact them on support.
They were awesome.

337
00:19:49,051 --> 00:19:51,180
They sent me one out without
a meeting and this one back.

338
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,360
So they're really good on customer
service. We're based out of Utah. Um,

339
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:57,420
it's a fun little hobby. Some people
roast beans in there, like oven,

340
00:19:57,421 --> 00:19:59,250
they'll put it on a flat
pan and restroom beans.

341
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:02,640
But if you've ever been kind of
been curious and wanting to, uh,

342
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:07,290
you're being curious. One of the things
I will say is a software does not work,

343
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:11,490
uh, on the Mac. So what I did
is I downloaded, uh, parallels,

344
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:14,940
launched windows 10 inside of it,
connected it via USB,

345
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,180
and then ran off from there and
it worked just fine. So anyway,

346
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:22,440
fun little hobby if you're ever been
curious or you get into kind of pour over

347
00:20:22,441 --> 00:20:27,120
coffee at your own house, this is
kind of next level shit. So, um,

348
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:28,980
there's all different types
of beans that you can buy.

349
00:20:28,981 --> 00:20:32,980
I got these from a place
called Sweet Maria's, which
is based out of Oakland. Uh,

350
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,620
they have a great online store.

351
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:38,600
Don't lick your fingers if you're watching
the video version of this and it's

352
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:41,880
disgusting and he's bleeding and licking
himself when I'm talking about coffee.

353
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,690
Um, anyway, have fun with it. It's a,

354
00:20:45,691 --> 00:20:48,040
it's a fun gift for the
coffee enthusiasts out

355
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,670
there.

356
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:51,390
You can get started for under a couple
hundred bucks or right around a couple

357
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:54,850
hundred bucks.
That is my next thing.

358
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,560
Was it distracting you've workout? I mean
it's just like, what are you doing dude?

359
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:04,970
So I have 0.7 point $7
million for Ketones,

360
00:21:05,411 --> 00:21:09,710
which is not as high as I would like
it, which I attribute to the, yeah,

361
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:13,780
to the eight grams of Kombucha or eight
grams of carbohydrate income Mucho,

362
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:18,370
which is all sugar even though I
walked about two miles to get here. Um,

363
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,700
so there, there you go on and have
a glucose of 93, which is way, way,

364
00:21:21,701 --> 00:21:25,150
way too high for my, for my
preference. So that's it.

365
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:30,210
I'll keep the blood there and off of
your kids literally sitting on the couch.

366
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,310
No, no, no. It's on top
of the little. I know,

367
00:21:33,311 --> 00:21:36,250
but that's just like one toaster
jump from being in your blood. It is,

368
00:21:36,251 --> 00:21:40,210
it is definitely one toaster jumps. A
No jumping on the blood toaster. Uh,

369
00:21:40,211 --> 00:21:45,211
so I have a related suggestion
or option for folks and that is,

370
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,370
have you ever done anything with coffee,
by the way? Are you a coffee guy?

371
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:52,300
I like coffee, either grocery and
stuff. I've never roasted my own stuff.

372
00:21:52,301 --> 00:21:55,480
I've done tons of pour over stuff.
I have the air press at home.

373
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:57,500
I know that's not a pushover,
but I do have the [inaudible],

374
00:21:57,510 --> 00:22:00,340
the [inaudible] and uh,
there's a,

375
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:04,420
I think there's a Hario version
or is that the vcs and he's 60.

376
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,090
There's a no talking about the blue
auto one that goes like this. And

377
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:13,030
I have a couple of other options,
but I've been doing mostly t the, uh,

378
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:18,360
the other option for roasting beans
that I've seen is using a popcorn.

379
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,260
Yeah. Roaster. This is more
or less the same thing.

380
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:23,080
The same thing with a
little bit more control.

381
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,960
And that's what Mark Marin does at
home. I mean, this thing is, is, I mean,

382
00:22:25,961 --> 00:22:28,180
I don't know how much it is.
I can't remember how you paid for it.

383
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,770
I want to say it's no more than $250.
And it could have been 150.

384
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:35,380
I don't remember that. Anyway, it's not
that expensive. Maybe he's expensive,

385
00:22:35,381 --> 00:22:37,960
but if you're really into it, it's,
uh, it's, it's pretty awesome.

386
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:41,980
I enjoyed drinking Kombucha, but
clearly on my current diet, it's,

387
00:22:41,981 --> 00:22:45,430
it's too much of a pain in my ass and
is going to knock me out of Ketosis.

388
00:22:45,431 --> 00:22:49,870
So what I might do to try
to get the probiotic, uh,

389
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:54,700
sort of bacterial benefit of
consuming Kombucha is take this stuff.

390
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:59,760
So this is saccharomyces Boulardii
if I'm getting that right.

391
00:23:00,161 --> 00:23:04,170
Plus Mos,
mos is men and oligosaccharides and uh,

392
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:09,300
these I will be using to repopulate my
gut after the antibiotics that I took

393
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:12,310
for.
Why this lack of this train though,

394
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:14,770
that that's what's found in the Kombucha.

395
00:23:14,771 --> 00:23:17,680
So I'm not consuming just
that I be consuming this.

396
00:23:17,681 --> 00:23:19,800
I'd be consuming some insulin,

397
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:23,770
but Indian Lynn can also spike
insulin and contains sugars.

398
00:23:23,771 --> 00:23:25,630
So I have to be cautious
of how much I consume.

399
00:23:25,631 --> 00:23:29,100
Probably less than 30 grams a day would
make obviously a lot of sense from

400
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:33,310
aiming for a fewer than 30 grams of
carbs per day. And what was that?

401
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:39,540
What was that?
Oh yeah.

402
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:43,270
It can make you farty that's
true. Yeah. So those are, yeah.

403
00:23:43,271 --> 00:23:46,780
Fructo oligosaccharides
that can you socially, uh,

404
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:48,650
inappropriate and unfriendly?

405
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,630
Can I prick myself and see where
I'm blood your wise? Uh, yeah, sure.

406
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:57,680
An extra pricker I always
have an extra freaker for you.

407
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:01,670
Uh, yes I do. I have an
extra printer via clean one.

408
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:06,110
I'll give you a clean pricker um,
hair.

409
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,420
Do you want me to do it for you or you
want to do, I want to do it myself.

410
00:24:08,421 --> 00:24:10,070
I just want to make sure you
not like double pricking me.

411
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:16,740
You know how much you like double
Frickin, not even here. You know,

412
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:19,200
you can put it in yourself. How do you
take the lace lid off? These are like,

413
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:22,940
you twist it off. So put this little guy,
he slipped, man. Your vocab is killing.

414
00:24:22,941 --> 00:24:25,940
Isn't that what is, what does at least
they call it? That's a land set. Lancet.

415
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,270
Okay.

416
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:30,110
But you've got to hold it there and
push it down pretty hard so that then it

417
00:24:30,111 --> 00:24:33,880
goes, it's going to protect me
right away. No, no, no. Yeah.

418
00:24:33,881 --> 00:24:37,180
Get it seated and then you did
twist it off. All right. All right.

419
00:24:37,181 --> 00:24:40,480
We're going to do this. Ooh Shit. And
then I have a gift for you. All right.

420
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:45,490
You want to put that top on? Okay.
And then, um, your bloods on here.

421
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,780
None of my blood's on there. I'm
going to do like on my arm. Uh,

422
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:52,870
I mean it's not calibrated for that,
but if you want to do that,

423
00:24:52,871 --> 00:24:55,780
you're welcome to. You want to do it on
your hand? Yeah, I don't want to do it.

424
00:24:55,781 --> 00:24:59,710
Like I just don't want to do it in an
eye on the fingertips or hurts like a

425
00:24:59,711 --> 00:25:04,330
biatch here. Gimme that right. I'm going
to do it on my like arm here. All right.

426
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:08,840
Go for it. So I do it over a vein
or is that just like Dang Shit,

427
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,080
don't do it. Just do it. Do a finger
finger would be my suggestion.

428
00:25:13,081 --> 00:25:15,180
But if you want to do your
hand, no, no, no. Here we go.

429
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:19,140
It was pushing away instead of two,
which I set it at. Hold on to is fun.

430
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:23,190
Let me get this thing. It's
three like further in three.
We'll go further in. Okay,

431
00:25:23,191 --> 00:25:25,980
here we go. Alright, hold on a sec.

432
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:29,230
Let me get this ready so you don't
have a hass out before we take your

433
00:25:29,231 --> 00:25:34,030
measurement.
If I just passed out on the show,

434
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:38,540
let me go for it. I'm doing, I
didn't feel anything. Yeah, I know.

435
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:41,280
It doesn't hurt. It didn't hurt at
all. And that's not going to be enough.

436
00:25:41,281 --> 00:25:43,320
You're gonna have to do it again. They're
going to have to do it on your fingers.

437
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,640
The same thing. Just use the
same thing. How do I reload it?

438
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:49,300
You pull that thing back. Okay.
No other side. Listen. Yeah.

439
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:53,110
And then just do your fingertips. It's
not going to work on your form. Oh,

440
00:25:53,111 --> 00:25:56,050
you know what? Hold on. But you're going
to need to use the use the alcohol again.

441
00:25:56,051 --> 00:25:58,750
Yeah.
Okay.

442
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:02,620
Should I say it to really get the job
done and you seem to be a poor bleeder.

443
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:04,930
Oh butterfly.
I hate this feeling.

444
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:13,030
Alright, there we go.
I didn't even feel it.

445
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:21,400
Yeah. All right. Wow, man, you
really don't bleed very well. Um,

446
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,290
let me squeeze.
I can get some shit out of it.

447
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:32,050
You are not bleeding.
I need to drink some more alcohol.

448
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:37,180
No Dude. They drink alcohol to
constrict the blood and thinking about,

449
00:26:37,181 --> 00:26:38,014
I need to do it again

450
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:47,850
doing it. You're really shitty. No,
there's nothing coming out here. Do the,

451
00:26:47,851 --> 00:26:50,900
you're doing the middle of your finger
to the outside edge of your finger right

452
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:53,280
here. Yeah. Yeah. On the edge.

453
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,053
Okay.

454
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:02,580
Ah, that one butterflying knows. Good butterflyer.
Oh, that'll probably, yeah, there we go.

455
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:07,530
It's a little better. Oh, barely.

456
00:27:07,531 --> 00:27:11,160
Barely. Keep going. Oh my God.

457
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,330
I can't believe you're
such a shitty bleeder. Uh,

458
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:19,950
we're almost there. We're like
halfway there. You gets here

459
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:26,410
or there we go. Oh yeah. It's close.

460
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:33,450
It's so close.
This is like the sloppiest butterflying

461
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,680
Oh my God. Yeah. This is your folder.

462
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:46,040
All you just touched on you.
God dammit.

463
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:50,970
I'm more pissed that you're wasting my
God. Damn. There we go. There you guys.

464
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,153
Oh yeah.

465
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,433
Yeah.

466
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:59,590
Come on you butterflying thing. It says
three. What does that mean? Oh butterfly it.

467
00:27:59,591 --> 00:28:02,710
Errored out because we took to
hold back out again. You again. No,

468
00:28:02,711 --> 00:28:06,550
this thing won't work. We'd have to
do it again. Are you kidding? No,

469
00:28:06,551 --> 00:28:09,070
he tried to lock me. I'm gonna do one
more then pulled back in a sick way again.

470
00:28:09,071 --> 00:28:11,470
Maybe we'll, no, this thing's toast.
We're going to have to do another one.

471
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:13,810
Oh my God.
I'm bleeding all over the place now.

472
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:20,380
Okay, hold on. Alright, hold
on. Sorry. People will cut it.
Some of this out. No, no, no.

473
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:24,140
Don't cut this out. This is
Ben. This is goal. Uh, alright,

474
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:27,140
so I'm going another finger.
Yup.

475
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:34,030
This is gonna. This is a really
shitty thing to have to do yourself.

476
00:28:34,031 --> 00:28:35,560
I've already cut myself three times.
Now.

477
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:43,900
You should take it to four. No.
Three willing to, Oh, here we go.

478
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:49,800
All right, here we go.
Ready? Three, two, one.

479
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:53,470
Take you a second to do it. Ah, Jesus.

480
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:58,020
I'll wait until you're ready. Let me get
a good amount of, there we go. All right.

481
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:02,750
Yeah, yeah. Okay. That's funny. Okay, now

482
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:11,320
you have a bandaid. I don't
have a [inaudible] 87 what
does that mean? Is it good?

483
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:14,470
Is it good?
It's all right.

484
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:20,590
What were you I was 90 I think.
93 okay.

485
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:25,180
You're 87 87 and then go, oh,
there we go. What does that, uh,

486
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:28,840
in my wait, was that a ketone
stick or blood sugar one,

487
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,590
but I want to ketone all, I can do another
one if you want. I got it. I got it.

488
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:35,200
Sorry guys.
We'll cut some of this up.

489
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:37,863
Okay.

490
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:42,340
It is you got to you if I
got enough or good enough.

491
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:50,110
Okay. Ketones, sorry.
This born Jesus. Turn on.

492
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:58,450
Hold on,
hold on.

493
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:04,980
Okay.
All right.

494
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:08,740
I guess 0.02 that's my guest.

495
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:12,790
Now I'm going to give you points
of your three. Oh Shit. Sorry.

496
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:18,070
That's what it was. Subway. Oh Dude.

497
00:30:18,071 --> 00:30:22,540
How good is that? Just it,
yeah. 0.3 does that bad.

498
00:30:22,541 --> 00:30:24,850
I guess it exactly.
You're not really in Ketosis,

499
00:30:24,851 --> 00:30:28,140
but you can get there a little bit
more work. You're a point there.

500
00:30:28,141 --> 00:30:31,870
I think I said points through three
a minute. Getting there though. Yeah.

501
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:35,030
You got a ways to go, but uh,
but you're getting there swing,

502
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:38,860
but on the Keto sticks, you wouldn't
have that level of granularity.

503
00:30:38,861 --> 00:30:42,310
You wouldn't have any way of really
telling you go with that dude,

504
00:30:42,311 --> 00:30:45,190
you're bleeding because I have it.
That's why you should suck on your finger.

505
00:30:45,191 --> 00:30:49,810
It'll fix it. Alright.
That was very exciting.

506
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:56,320
Okay. People, sorry for the, all
right. Weird episode. That was great.

507
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:58,840
I have a gift for you. Okay.
Maybe you can put on your finger.

508
00:30:58,841 --> 00:31:03,620
Don't put any finger, uh, this, this is
sue grew. You ever seen this done? Oh,

509
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:08,430
it does this. So it's multiple glue. It's,
I believe originally from the UK and my,

510
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:12,910
my mom gave it to me for Christmas
last year. It is kind of,

511
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:16,270
imagine if,
uh,

512
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:20,530
like super glue and Plato had a love
child. It'd be something like this.

513
00:31:20,531 --> 00:31:23,440
You can use it to fix anything.
Like if you have a,

514
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:25,690
a cracked handle on a pot,

515
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:29,530
you could fix it and mold it and it
won't stick your fingers and then it will

516
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:31,970
solidify and it will, it'll, it,

517
00:31:31,971 --> 00:31:36,670
it'll become completely held together
for those hard to glue things. Yep.

518
00:31:36,671 --> 00:31:39,700
You could use it for repairing, saying
iPhone cases cracked. You could use it.

519
00:31:39,701 --> 00:31:42,610
It's not really solely glue.
You could actually people,

520
00:31:42,611 --> 00:31:47,560
I've seen people use Subaru to
make mounts for cameras. Um,

521
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:51,020
I've seen them use it for turns into
rubber is what it's saying. Yeah.

522
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:54,050
The 24 hours. Yeah.
Basically. Yeah, exactly. Huh.

523
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:58,580
It's a moldable glue that turns into
rubber so you could make toys out of it.

524
00:31:58,581 --> 00:32:01,990
You can do just about anything crazy.
Pretty cool. Awesome. Thanks Dan. Yeah,

525
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,970
definitely. So how did
you, I mean, is this,

526
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,700
you had this land rent at home or why did
you decide to give me this gift today?

527
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:11,230
I appreciate it because I liked
the stuff and I got so, so, uh,

528
00:32:11,231 --> 00:32:15,760
I figured out pass that along.
Awesome. And uh, so other,

529
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:19,440
other stuff that people may
not have seen before, uh,

530
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:23,680
this is an antiinflammatory Gel,
which is pretty controversial, uh,

531
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:26,030
partially because it's,
see,

532
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:30,520
it's labeled as homeopathic and I
have issues with so called homeopathic

533
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:33,640
medicine and I've written about this
before so you can search Tim Ferriss,

534
00:32:33,641 --> 00:32:36,400
homeopathic medicine if you want
to see my take on it. But, um,

535
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:41,700
the short version that
generally homeopathic medicine
has no evidence for its

536
00:32:41,781 --> 00:32:44,420
efficacy. But, uh, this stuff,

537
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:49,421
trauma meal is incredibly effective for
injury repair and for antiinflammatory

538
00:32:51,801 --> 00:32:55,040
purposes. If you have some
type of, of tear or otherwise.

539
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:58,340
So I use this stuff all the time.
I did mention this in the four hour body.

540
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:00,020
Is it like a been gay type stuff?

541
00:33:00,021 --> 00:33:03,530
Like we're just burns and feels good and
kind of loosens up the muscle or it's

542
00:33:03,531 --> 00:33:05,780
not just say the Menthol,

543
00:33:05,781 --> 00:33:10,730
typically the venues of the world
use menthol and so on for that.

544
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:11,660
Um,

545
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:16,660
this seems to have some type of
curative effect or restorative effect,

546
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:20,600
not just a temporary numbing effect.
Um,

547
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:24,380
so these is like post workout. Like what
are you primarily using this for? Like,

548
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:25,750
well, I tore, I,

549
00:33:25,751 --> 00:33:29,270
I have a minor tear of my right hamstring
at the insertion point at the hip.

550
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:33,110
So I'm using this, I could have used this
like a year ago when I ripped a muscle.

551
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:35,120
This stuff's great for that. So, um,

552
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:37,730
I've seen some miraculous
recoveries including this.

553
00:33:37,731 --> 00:33:42,600
This isn't sufficient by itself. But if
you were to combine this with say, uh,

554
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:49,120
some, uh, electric stimulation
with a device like the mark to uh,

555
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:53,930
or some type of ultrasound
and then apply this,

556
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,960
this, uh, this, this can
work some wonders. So anyway,

557
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:59,990
for those people who haven't seen
it traumeel easy to find now.

558
00:33:59,991 --> 00:34:01,040
It used to be really hard to find.

559
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:04,880
Now I think you can get it at whole foods
and they're also a ingestible versions,

560
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:07,460
but I tend to use the topical sweep.
Yeah.

561
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:10,580
What else do you have a,
so a couple things. One,

562
00:34:10,581 --> 00:34:15,581
I decided to do a experiment and ventured
down into some more photography and

563
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:20,530
um, I picked up this camera. A buddy
of mine recommended this camera.

564
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:25,810
It's a Leica. Um, this
is the em dash p and a

565
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,410
feel how heavy that thing is.
First of all,

566
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:30,020
I don't know if you've ever messed
around with a Leica before. Uh,

567
00:34:30,021 --> 00:34:33,350
I do not have any like, uh,
but that is a heavy camera.

568
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:36,700
Yeah, it's, it's pretty bad ass. So I just
got this, I'm just learning about it. Um,

569
00:34:36,701 --> 00:34:39,460
if any people have any recommendations
or they actually shooting like as of any

570
00:34:39,461 --> 00:34:42,370
good books that I can pick up,
um, I would love to hear them.

571
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:44,170
So just tweet at me at Kevin Rose.

572
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:47,230
But the thing I love about
this is it's completely manual.

573
00:34:47,231 --> 00:34:50,680
Like everything from sending the f
stops up here, there is no auto focus,

574
00:34:50,681 --> 00:34:53,910
so you manually focus up here,
you get your shutter speed right here,

575
00:34:53,911 --> 00:34:57,910
set your ISO in the back, like
everything is manual. So you know,

576
00:34:57,911 --> 00:35:00,730
you probably nail like
one in every 10 photos,

577
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:05,500
but when you nail one it's
just like unbelievable and
it's very beautiful and it

578
00:35:05,501 --> 00:35:09,190
has a very kind of vintagey feel like,
let me show you some of these uh,

579
00:35:09,191 --> 00:35:11,110
these photos that I'll give a

580
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:15,250
oh, is that only have one on their team
and I only have one on there. Um, I,

581
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,210
I sucked him off and I told him to delete
on my computer but sucked them all out.

582
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:24,540
You guys have been, you've been drinking.
I love that. My wife is like double,

583
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:26,600
double brickton sucking.

584
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:33,060
How was it that sucked them all off.
Got Your anyway,

585
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:38,190
so like of stuff

586
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:41,130
is fun. Uh, I'll give grandma a couple
of photos that you can put on here,

587
00:35:41,131 --> 00:35:45,390
but it creates these really
very beautiful vivid photos. Um,

588
00:35:45,391 --> 00:35:47,460
if you're into,
I dunno,

589
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:51,510
I'm kind of like getting into this stage
of my life where I liked more manual

590
00:35:51,511 --> 00:35:53,730
things.
Like I'm not about technology,

591
00:35:53,731 --> 00:35:55,740
I'm trying to get away from
it a little bit. One of the,

592
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:56,880
one of the models that they have,

593
00:35:56,881 --> 00:35:58,350
I think that you'll think
this is kind of interesting.

594
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:02,340
They have this special edition version
of that camera is digital camera.

595
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,580
No LCD on the back,
no preview.

596
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,030
So you take the photos and we literally
hook it up to your computer and you

597
00:36:09,031 --> 00:36:12,900
can't sit there and look like until
you actually suck them off forcing you,

598
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:21,630
you can't see what they look like. It's a
cycle off. This is like a mystery party.

599
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:24,810
Glory Hole.
This is exciting.

600
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:30,280
I love it is my wife is like

601
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:34,290
them all.

602
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:43,650
But I know what you mean about manual
illiteracy and just wanting to use your

603
00:36:43,651 --> 00:36:47,730
hands more to build things and to do
things as opposed to simply being in front

604
00:36:47,731 --> 00:36:49,390
of a screen,
uh,

605
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:53,520
eight to 16 inches away from
blue light or even like,

606
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:58,410
so by the time this happens it hits the,
a apple watch will be out and it's like,

607
00:36:58,411 --> 00:37:00,360
what do you think about that? Are
you going to get one of those? I,

608
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:03,600
I'm not going to get one because I have
enough devices. I don't need a watch.

609
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:06,980
I have time on my phone.
I don't need to put,

610
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:09,960
and I don't need to read you racked with
anything else, but anything pull you in.

611
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:12,480
Like let's say the center has got
really good and you could monitor,

612
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:16,500
well you can real time, 24, seven heart
rate with it. That's interesting. Yeah,

613
00:37:16,501 --> 00:37:18,100
it's okay. Um, events,

614
00:37:18,101 --> 00:37:20,610
the data is only interesting to
me and so much as I can use it.

615
00:37:20,611 --> 00:37:24,780
So I'm probably not going to do much with
that then. Yeah, I feel like it's, I,

616
00:37:24,781 --> 00:37:27,240
I'm going to get one because I have
two and a half to play within all that,

617
00:37:27,241 --> 00:37:31,780
but I just don't need more.
You, you don't, if you,

618
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:35,310
you ever try and text him after
6:00 PM it just doesn't go through.

619
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:39,900
You shut your phone off. Yeah. I put my
phone on, on a airplane, on airplane mode.

620
00:37:39,901 --> 00:37:42,890
Like it's on airplane mode right now.
But you do that all the time? I do. Yeah.

621
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:44,400
Why is that?
Uh,

622
00:37:44,401 --> 00:37:47,700
because I don't want to be reactive and
I don't want to feel like I have the

623
00:37:47,701 --> 00:37:50,170
universe going, hey, hey, butterfly
face, which is what it is,

624
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:52,800
which is what getting messages
feels like to me. Well,

625
00:37:52,801 --> 00:37:55,220
and that's the problem with the,
the Apple Watch, to be honest.

626
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:58,530
Like I want more of that.
I was with a buddy to this morning,

627
00:37:58,531 --> 00:38:02,940
we had coffee and he had went on and
he was just like, and it was just like,

628
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:05,140
I'm like, what are we looking at there?
What was that? And he's just like, oh,

629
00:38:05,141 --> 00:38:07,530
it was just a little thing and let me
know about this and that. And I was like,

630
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:11,700
I don't know, man, that just seems
like one more, our brains are like,

631
00:38:11,701 --> 00:38:12,750
I don't know how you feel about this,

632
00:38:12,751 --> 00:38:15,990
but when you get 30 tabs open in your
web browser and you're doing all these

633
00:38:15,991 --> 00:38:18,510
different things,
there's no focus anymore.

634
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:22,920
And all of a sudden that that plays
out in how you see everything.

635
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:24,330
And I worry that like,

636
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:28,560
I have a hard enough time
keeping a conversation with
my wife or anyone else at

637
00:38:28,561 --> 00:38:31,770
dinner. Like with my phone sitting
there, it's like, you know,

638
00:38:31,771 --> 00:38:33,870
we always have this like, she's
like, can you put your phone away?

639
00:38:33,871 --> 00:38:35,980
Like it says it like
multiple times a week.

640
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,150
Yeah.
And it's important.

641
00:38:37,151 --> 00:38:40,450
It's important that we get this stuff
out of an off of us. No, I agree.

642
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:43,480
That's why I think, you know,
putting your phone on airplane mode,

643
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:45,281
at the very least,

644
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:48,220
I put my phone on airplane mode and I
put it face down when I'm having dinner.

645
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:51,220
Uh, typically since it's on
airplane mode or I have it awful,

646
00:38:51,221 --> 00:38:52,570
just put it my punishing
you a different mode.

647
00:38:52,571 --> 00:38:57,400
Do you know about the little sleepy mode?
Uh, I have used do not disturb mode,

648
00:38:57,490 --> 00:39:01,310
but this is also a chance to show
people that maybe this wasn't, uh,

649
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:04,780
so I've upgraded to the tablet and
the phone, tablet, worst case ever.

650
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:06,340
Why don't you get that case?

651
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,190
Because I care less about how it
looks and I care more about it.

652
00:39:09,191 --> 00:39:11,680
Preventing my phone from breaking. No,
I know, but there's a nice leather ones.

653
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,290
I'll get you one.
So in any case,

654
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:18,730
I got this monstrous thing and a,
I'm quite fond of it.

655
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:22,810
And in part of the reason I'm fond of it
is I experimented with going without my

656
00:39:22,811 --> 00:39:26,740
laptop, but I don't like tapping
on the iPhone screen. I hate,

657
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:31,870
I hate producing content with my thumbs.
It makes me insane and it's really slow.

658
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:35,290
So what I ended up doing,
uh, when I was traveling,

659
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,600
so it's not using vanity fair,

660
00:39:37,601 --> 00:39:42,280
but rather using this tiny thing that I
can put inside a magazine or a book to

661
00:39:42,281 --> 00:39:45,850
protect it.
This is a logic keyboard that's uh,

662
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:50,590
that's Bluetooth and you
just, you turn it on, just,

663
00:39:50,591 --> 00:39:54,730
you flip the switch here and I can balance
this phone. It's not really balancing.

664
00:39:54,731 --> 00:39:58,870
Lean it against like a glass of water or
something and then type in the same way

665
00:39:58,871 --> 00:40:03,670
that I would type on a laptop but I'm
only traveling with that and to have those

666
00:40:03,671 --> 00:40:06,190
like Microsoft server,
you could just get an iPad two and do,

667
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,720
I don't like I had snow because then
I have this plus basically half of the

668
00:40:10,721 --> 00:40:12,070
laptop.
Do you what I mean it's,

669
00:40:12,071 --> 00:40:15,820
it's bigger and I don't need a larger
screen than this for most of the type

670
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,940
thing that I do and the fact that we
feel this thing, how light that is,

671
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:22,090
it's so light, so I hadn't,
the battery life lasts eight.

672
00:40:22,091 --> 00:40:25,360
We'll ages once you've charged it up
via USB, it's actually pretty good.

673
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:28,600
It's really light. I have a the
new air coming. Have you seen it?

674
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:33,290
I haven't ate super tiny dude
like half the size last ones.

675
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:35,410
Sorry.
It's not there anymore.

676
00:40:35,411 --> 00:40:37,270
It's just all imac was so
I didn't get the brand new.

677
00:40:37,271 --> 00:40:41,500
I just got a new Mac book and I made
sell it. What size is it? It's fine.

678
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:45,550
It's a 13 inch. The new one is like
that dude. And it's like that thin,

679
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:49,270
it's insane. Like if you're looking for
portability, that's the only one to get.

680
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:54,310
Yeah. So in any case that is another
experiment in mobility. I think this is,

681
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:59,210
is a, is going to be super useful
for 99% of what I do. Cool. Um,

682
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:04,000
aside from, from storage
and then, uh, let's see,

683
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:08,730
this is, this is kind of funny, but um,
so this, this is the book that I've got a,

684
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:13,600
it's not a book, it's a magazine mark.
So I have been like, I feel like,

685
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:18,100
I feel like a, this is, people might
get pissed about this, but whatever.

686
00:41:18,101 --> 00:41:21,230
I feel like a bride to be. Maybe
not you, Daria. I'm not sure.

687
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:25,180
But a lot of women who feel like all
like, no, no, no, like go wedding crazy.

688
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:26,890
I'm not saying,
I don't know if you did or not,

689
00:41:26,891 --> 00:41:29,170
but a lot they have all the wedding
magazines. Do you what I'm talking about?

690
00:41:29,171 --> 00:41:33,740
She never had one. But
anyway. Ah, okay. So anyway,

691
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:37,730
when people are getting
ready for something, a big
event like getting married,

692
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,600
having a kid, they start reading all
the baby magazines, parenting magazines,

693
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:41,960
the wedding magazines,
whatever the hell.

694
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:46,420
And so I've been putting off getting
a dog. So I started reading magazines

695
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,340
and the cover is what got me all you need,

696
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:56,510
all you need is love with this
dog. Like, and I was like, Oh,

697
00:41:56,511 --> 00:42:00,860
I got stabbed in the heart.
And so this is about,

698
00:42:00,861 --> 00:42:03,860
is San Francisco's you get uh,
the sub,

699
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:07,400
the sub title is dog is my
copilot. That's funny. Okay.

700
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:10,100
And then it's the dog culture magazine.

701
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:14,180
It's just like the most SF hipster
thing imaginable. So what do you,

702
00:42:14,181 --> 00:42:16,490
have you narrowed it down to any
breeds yet? What is pretty good?

703
00:42:16,491 --> 00:42:19,550
Actually I was enjoying reading yesterday,
had the history of the seeing eye dog,

704
00:42:19,551 --> 00:42:22,460
which I was very excited about. Uh,
I'm going to get a dog and we rescue.

705
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:24,260
It'll definitely be a rescue and it's,

706
00:42:24,261 --> 00:42:29,261
it's a matter of just doing it and stop
stopping all the thinking I think is

707
00:42:29,811 --> 00:42:33,290
what it comes down to.
I think there's no good time to get a dog,

708
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:37,550
have baby make any huge decision.
You just have to,

709
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:42,830
that's going to really do it. And then
you're a world traveler. It's tough.

710
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:44,240
I am, but I, you know,

711
00:42:44,241 --> 00:42:48,200
I love San Francisco so much
and I'm spending more time
in La and then New York,

712
00:42:48,201 --> 00:42:52,190
it's really three locations where I spend
90% of my time and if I'm going to be

713
00:42:52,191 --> 00:42:53,480
gone for any period of time,
I would take,

714
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:57,590
figure out a way to take the dog with me.
So I'm not too too worried about that.

715
00:42:57,710 --> 00:43:02,070
Um, I think in smaller size, bigger size,
what do you pay? Like 30 pounds. 30, 40.

716
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:05,420
Yeah. It will be interesting. I need to,
I need a dog that I can kind of swap,

717
00:43:05,421 --> 00:43:09,480
play with and wrestle, play with
without wondering if I'm going to get up

718
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:16,150
somehow dislocate a hip or a juicer.
Gimme the toaster.

719
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:20,360
It's very hesitant. Hey,
go. Telstra is a 25 pounds,

720
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:25,670
25 pounds in growing. He's a
good guy. Cores, light and grain.

721
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:28,760
It's going on now. He doesn't drink.
It doesn't drink. Oh, that's right.

722
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:32,030
[inaudible] has the most
incredible negative response
to alcohol I've ever seen,

723
00:43:32,031 --> 00:43:35,080
which is just witness.
You go like this with a glass of wine.

724
00:43:35,081 --> 00:43:39,050
He just back pedals from like five
feet away from the glass. Yeah,

725
00:43:39,051 --> 00:43:41,180
he does not like here.
Here's an example of toast.

726
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,760
Torture him. I tell him to come here.
It's okay. All right, so I've got, I've,

727
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:54,500
I've a book to share with people.

728
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:58,180
Well, hold on. You've been like
three in a row then, right?
Go, go, go, go for it. So,

729
00:43:58,181 --> 00:44:02,890
um, I have a quarterly box coming
out similar to Tim's quarterly box.

730
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:07,960
Um, I think mine is, I don't know my URL
anyway, you can search Google quarterly.

731
00:44:07,961 --> 00:44:11,770
Kevin Rose in my next box and whether
you subscribe to my box or not,

732
00:44:11,771 --> 00:44:14,200
I really don't care.
I'm just telling you about this.

733
00:44:14,201 --> 00:44:16,090
This is matcha tea from breakaway.
Watch it.

734
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,940
You've had this before break way
before, right? It's good. It's great.

735
00:44:18,941 --> 00:44:23,941
Montia for people that don't know and
people like myself that have way too much

736
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:28,260
caffeine in their life or I should say
too much coffee in my life and you want

737
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:30,190
something that's a little bit
more healthy and a change.

738
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:35,490
Macia is essentially the entire
leaf of the tea plant ground up.

739
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,870
So they take these um,
very large,

740
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:43,260
very heavy kind of um, what does
it there may out of there man. Huh?

741
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:44,650
You seen these connectors?

742
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:49,530
They're stone but they're heavy stones
and they grind them into a very fine

743
00:44:49,531 --> 00:44:54,200
green powder. So this is kind of
what a actually thought open. Uh,

744
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:56,760
but you don't want to spill it
on your website. We can show you,

745
00:44:56,761 --> 00:44:59,370
we can show you a picture
online but you take a little,

746
00:44:59,371 --> 00:45:01,860
what I do is I take a
little tiny scoop of this,

747
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:05,400
put it in the bottom and then add a little
bit of hot water just about that much.

748
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:10,230
Buy a coffee for author and
then you use that in froth.

749
00:45:10,231 --> 00:45:13,950
The very bottom of it, it'll create
this almost like foamy type substance.

750
00:45:13,951 --> 00:45:17,670
And then you add more hot water and
you have like a green tea latte.

751
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,740
It's a great caffeine boost. Um, and
it's just the foam. Awesome. Yeah.

752
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:25,600
Well you don't get as much hand that way.
It's,

753
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:31,500
well, we don't want that. I like,

754
00:45:31,501 --> 00:45:36,320
I like a good for me head on the
anti much. Of course it's like I,

755
00:45:36,321 --> 00:45:39,960
it's better to start off and do it at
initially rather than wait until the end.

756
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:43,410
Then you suck them all off
and get the double Prek.

757
00:45:46,290 --> 00:45:49,140
I'm the one drinking and you're
the one, oh, it was amazing. No,

758
00:45:49,141 --> 00:45:52,800
I want this to continue. I can just
do my last one. Oh good. All right.

759
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:57,300
This is awesome. Uh, do
you know what does this,

760
00:45:57,301 --> 00:46:00,930
I don't think I can guess. So this, okay.

761
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:05,120
Go ahead and guess
fermenting. Correct. So, um,

762
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:10,110
don't say.com and so this is a gift I
actually owned fermenting dot. Come on.

763
00:46:10,111 --> 00:46:12,200
That's why it's funny.
I'm doing nothing with Oh yeah.

764
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:16,930
So if you ever want to do something with
it, I'm good. But somebody in the, uh,

765
00:46:17,090 --> 00:46:21,280
so internet as people that we've talked
about this before on the show fermenting

766
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:23,610
is great. Um, you get a lot of a helpful,

767
00:46:23,611 --> 00:46:27,570
friendly bacteria that grow on fermented
foods and it also makes a lot of foods

768
00:46:27,571 --> 00:46:31,030
more bioavailable. Thanks Ben. Um,

769
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:33,450
and basically what this vessel is,

770
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:37,770
my good friend Tony Conrad gave
this as a gift for my birthday.

771
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:38,730
And this is a,

772
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:43,730
a a clay vessel that is made by a
company called a counterculture pottery.

773
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:49,740
And so these two guys right here,
these are two little clay tablets. Um,

774
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:53,630
and what happens is you start off
with whatever you want to ferment.

775
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:55,980
So in this case,
what I like to do a lot of is sauerkraut.

776
00:46:55,981 --> 00:46:59,400
So you follow a simple little recipe.
It's as easy as taking some cabbage,

777
00:46:59,401 --> 00:47:02,580
kind of Michigan all together with
some salt, adding some caraway seeds,

778
00:47:02,581 --> 00:47:05,590
whatever else you want to add.
You put it in here and then you,

779
00:47:05,591 --> 00:47:07,830
you take these apart and
these are your weights.

780
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:11,970
And then what happens is when that all
those cell walls of the cabbage breakdown,

781
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:14,820
they put off a lot of
just basically water.

782
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:17,310
And when these weights
sit on top of the cabbage,

783
00:47:17,311 --> 00:47:19,380
it pushes it down beneath the waterline.

784
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,630
So they're fully submerged
underneath the fluid,

785
00:47:21,631 --> 00:47:24,810
which is important because you don't
want that exposed cabbage floating out

786
00:47:24,811 --> 00:47:28,890
there and getting kind of like contact
with air. So after that's done,

787
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:32,470
you have in the kettle, you're ready to
ferment them for a couple of weeks. Yeah,

788
00:47:32,471 --> 00:47:34,750
you put the lid on. Now most
people think, okay, well that's it.

789
00:47:34,751 --> 00:47:39,220
But that's not the reason why there's
this little groove right here is you

790
00:47:39,221 --> 00:47:40,840
filled this groove with water.

791
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:44,650
And then what happens is as is for
men's and the gas tries to escape.

792
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:48,820
What you want is the gas they get out,
but no more air to get in.

793
00:47:48,821 --> 00:47:52,060
You don't want anything contaminating
the fermentation as it's going on.

794
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:55,510
So it's all, yeah, so it's solid.

795
00:47:55,511 --> 00:47:59,590
So what happens is it'll bubble and
little bubbles would come out of the side

796
00:47:59,591 --> 00:48:04,090
here, but the air, the air, right?
So that comes out to the water.

797
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:07,630
That's very clever with that. Or bacteria,
which is the most important thing.

798
00:48:07,631 --> 00:48:09,820
You don't want bacteria getting
in there cause this is like,

799
00:48:09,821 --> 00:48:13,780
you've got a lot of like
warmth and fermentation going
on in here. So that's it.

800
00:48:13,781 --> 00:48:18,670
This is, this is by far, you'll see a lot
of these on Amazon. A bunch of are crap.

801
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:20,950
I can't believe my friend found this.
This is by far.

802
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:22,990
I've been into fermenting for a while.

803
00:48:22,991 --> 00:48:27,360
I've looked at a ton of different vessels
by far the best. So culture, pottery,

804
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:32,020
counterculture, pottery correctly. Yeah.
So I don't know how much it was a gift.

805
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:35,170
I don't know how much she's run.
I didn't look it up and I'm not going to,

806
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:38,560
but it's beautiful.
It is like this is awesome.

807
00:48:38,561 --> 00:48:40,420
If you want to get into
fermenting in a serious way,

808
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:43,660
they have some great recipes in here
to this little instruction booklet.

809
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:48,080
It is so simple to do your own sauerkraut.
Seriously. If you've never tried it, um,

810
00:48:48,370 --> 00:48:50,920
I recommend it.
That is all I have

811
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:55,220
today. All right, so I've got two
more things to talk about this too.

812
00:48:55,221 --> 00:48:59,880
I don't know if you want to
talk about this. Oh, sure.
We can talk about this. Uh,

813
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:02,030
well, I mean, I'm going to
need you to elaborate here,

814
00:49:02,031 --> 00:49:04,820
but I've been getting on my very,

815
00:49:04,821 --> 00:49:08,660
very boring ketogenic diet eating eggs.
But the,

816
00:49:08,670 --> 00:49:13,670
one of the ways to make eggs more
interesting for me is to just perfect soft

817
00:49:13,701 --> 00:49:18,500
boiled eggs where you have this like
delicious, almost caramel, like,

818
00:49:18,950 --> 00:49:23,630
uh,
nectar of the yolk inside the egg,

819
00:49:23,631 --> 00:49:27,160
which is effectively the soft layers har.
Yeah.

820
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:36,520
Anyway, so I love softball. Boiled eggs,
the neck by the room. But there are,

821
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:41,330
this is where this is a performance
Kevin video show. Anyway.

822
00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:42,820
So yeah,

823
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,330
part of the challenge is if you're trying
to really get the perfect softball egg

824
00:49:47,331 --> 00:49:50,630
and you don't boil the egg long enough,

825
00:49:50,631 --> 00:49:54,050
then it just comes out as this just like
my asthma of disgusting goop and then

826
00:49:54,051 --> 00:49:58,280
it's no good. Right. So, uh,
so when I'm, when I'm doing a,

827
00:49:58,290 --> 00:50:00,730
generally I am doing,
uh,

828
00:50:01,550 --> 00:50:05,180
I like to use baking soda if possible,
which will reduce adherence to the shell.

829
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:09,830
Uh, but I will get it to
a boil the water that is,

830
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:14,480
and then I will reduce it to a
low boil sort of low turbulence,

831
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:17,810
add the eggs in and leave them
in for about five minutes.

832
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:19,940
Usually five to six minutes
is kind of perfect for me,

833
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:22,790
but it's still a bit of guesswork.
Uh,

834
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:26,270
and this device you guys told me about
when we went out to dinner the other

835
00:50:26,271 --> 00:50:30,380
night, which is effectively
a steamer as I understand it,

836
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:34,970
it's amazing and it's a single use device
that will give you perfect softball

837
00:50:34,971 --> 00:50:38,870
decks. And I was like, oh my God, I
don't generally have single use devices.

838
00:50:38,871 --> 00:50:40,810
Darian doesn't ever really,

839
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:42,740
but this is the one you guys use this.
Yeah,

840
00:50:42,890 --> 00:50:47,450
I bought this thing in our
egg hen years ago and uh,

841
00:50:47,550 --> 00:50:50,210
well let me show you how it works.
Yeah. So it's pretty straight forward.

842
00:50:50,211 --> 00:50:53,060
All you do is,
this is the base plate that gets hot.

843
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:55,610
You add in like two tablespoons

844
00:50:57,210 --> 00:51:00,840
how much oil you want and
how many eggs you have.

845
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:05,060
Right? There's a little
recipe in the water, but it
tells you how much to put in.

846
00:51:05,061 --> 00:51:06,680
So anyway,
I was just like generalizing.

847
00:51:06,681 --> 00:51:08,180
You add just a little bit
of water in the bottom.

848
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,760
Then you put the eggs inside of
these little holes right here.

849
00:51:10,761 --> 00:51:12,440
So you set them in, boom, boom, boom.

850
00:51:13,130 --> 00:51:15,620
If you want to actually crack the
eggs up and put them into here,

851
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:18,800
this will make poached eggs.
Um, and then, I don't even know,

852
00:51:18,850 --> 00:51:21,800
I never knew what these were for. Did
you find that name? Oh, that's more,

853
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:26,180
I don't know. Anyway, all I
ever did was put them in there.

854
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:29,780
You put the lid on and like you hit
this little switch right here on and it

855
00:51:29,781 --> 00:51:31,040
automatically shuts itself off.

856
00:51:32,330 --> 00:51:35,390
It's is because it's just
off in the water on that.

857
00:51:35,610 --> 00:51:38,470
Right, right. Okay. Got It. So you,
yeah. You need to get the amount of water

858
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:41,820
right. Kevin lost a piece,
but the most important pieces

859
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:45,113
I did lose that.

860
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:49,470
Or uh,
like you basically are like,

861
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:52,570
I want four eggs,
software and okay,

862
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:57,710
I see a measuring cup.
Okay, that's awesome.

863
00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:00,590
That's the magic amount because that
determines the duration and everything.

864
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:04,440
Cool. It's so easy. And this thing,
I think it was Alandra 30 bucks.

865
00:52:04,441 --> 00:52:08,220
It's not that expensive. Cool
thought that years and years ago. Uh,

866
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:10,310
this is a book that

867
00:52:10,370 --> 00:52:13,150
not many of you have seen.
Probably it is,

868
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:18,220
it is a new book as I understand it
and it is called a wrestling life.

869
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,270
And the,
uh,

870
00:52:20,410 --> 00:52:25,410
wrestling life is a collection of
stories about Dan Gable and by Dan Gable.

871
00:52:26,090 --> 00:52:29,960
And, uh, I never give cover
quotes, just don't do it.

872
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:34,310
But Dan Gable was and still is a hero
of mine. And when I was growing up,

873
00:52:34,311 --> 00:52:38,420
because he was sportsman of the century
according to this sports illustrated,

874
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:43,550
he is one of the best coaches of last
hundred years and widely considered that

875
00:52:43,551 --> 00:52:45,110
in any sport.
Uh,

876
00:52:45,111 --> 00:52:50,111
he won the gold medal in the Munich
Olympics in wrestling without having a

877
00:52:50,691 --> 00:52:51,860
single point scored on him,

878
00:52:51,861 --> 00:52:54,380
which is like winning Wimbledon
without having points scored on you.

879
00:52:54,381 --> 00:52:56,700
It's just impossible.
And uh,

880
00:52:56,730 --> 00:53:00,050
he was able then to take that people
thought he was already at the pinnacle.

881
00:53:00,051 --> 00:53:04,250
Okay. It's all downhill from here as it,
as it is the case for a lot of athletes.

882
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:08,270
And then he went into coaching and was
able to just produce monsters on demand.

883
00:53:08,271 --> 00:53:13,271
He created this just factory of mutants
and I think he had something like 200

884
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:18,760
plus a somewhere between 150 200 all
Americans out of that one, uh, uh,

885
00:53:18,770 --> 00:53:22,640
out of, uh, the Iowa
Hawkeyes and 10, I'm sorry.

886
00:53:22,790 --> 00:53:26,390
So I think it was like
13 big 10 in a row and,

887
00:53:26,490 --> 00:53:30,030
and that might be getting some of the
facts a little off. But, uh, he was,

888
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:33,750
he only lost one match and his entire
Ncaa career, which was his last match,

889
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:36,780
that's why he was so pissed that
he trained seven hours a day,

890
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:41,790
seven days a week before
the Munich Olympics and just
rolled through everybody.

891
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:45,210
Uh,
and he is really aggressive.

892
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:48,480
So I did put up a blog post at one
point called Ode to aggression,

893
00:53:48,481 --> 00:53:52,650
which has a clip of 10 Gable,
a coaching his wrestlers,

894
00:53:52,651 --> 00:53:56,580
which is phenomenal. So Google
that, oh, do aggression, Dan Gable.

895
00:53:56,820 --> 00:54:01,200
But my quote that I, that I gave
because I think it's very appropriate,

896
00:54:01,201 --> 00:54:05,190
is in a modern world of
political correctness and
glad handing the art of the

897
00:54:05,191 --> 00:54:08,490
fight is highly undervalued,
allowed Dan to show you another way,

898
00:54:08,550 --> 00:54:13,110
because Dan is a fighter.
Uh, and uh, that's it.

899
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:14,070
So this book,

900
00:54:14,130 --> 00:54:19,130
you can check it out if you want to get
an inkling of why I'm so fascinated with

901
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:24,320
Dan gable a as is John Irving for
instance, who's, who calls Dan Gable,

902
00:54:24,330 --> 00:54:28,610
one of his heroes meeting him changed
my life. Uh, his life as a wrestler,

903
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:32,490
as a coach, as a man dedicated to his
family, has served me as a model. Uh,

904
00:54:32,491 --> 00:54:37,110
and it just, it's an amazing story. So
check out the book or just a, you can,

905
00:54:37,111 --> 00:54:41,130
you can Google Ode to aggression and
take a look at Dan Gable. I think, uh,

906
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:45,900
it will, it will really leave an indelible
mark on your thinking because, uh,

907
00:54:45,930 --> 00:54:48,960
with this guy has been able to
do as a coach and a teacher,

908
00:54:49,230 --> 00:54:51,840
a impresses me more than
what he did as an athlete.

909
00:54:51,841 --> 00:54:56,250
And what he did as an athlete at the
time was basically unprecedented. Uh,

910
00:54:56,280 --> 00:55:00,990
so that's that. And then the, the
big news, the biggest news for me,

911
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:05,550
which involves you, uh, is, uh,

912
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:08,340
when people are watching
this at by this time,

913
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:12,060
they should be able to go to iTunes and
get the entire season of the Tim Ferriss

914
00:55:12,061 --> 00:55:13,410
experiment,
the TV show.

915
00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:18,890
And this has been something I fought
for for so long and if I did a lawyer up

916
00:55:20,281 --> 00:55:23,970
and negotiate for a year to get the
rights back, no one has seen 11,

917
00:55:23,971 --> 00:55:28,020
I think of the, of the 13 episodes
and most people haven't seen any, uh,

918
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:31,620
done with the team that filmed and
edited all of Anthony Bordain stuff.

919
00:55:31,650 --> 00:55:34,080
Super Gritty, super cinematic. Um,

920
00:55:34,081 --> 00:55:38,010
we were in the three gun
shooting episode together and uh,

921
00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:41,080
it was just an amazing experience.
So I finally have that.

922
00:55:41,081 --> 00:55:43,650
I've hours of bonus footage.
I'm also going to make that available.

923
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:48,780
And so you can see, uh, me basically
pushing myself to the breaking point.

924
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:52,560
And you do see a lot of injuries and
some of these episodes for park core,

925
00:55:52,561 --> 00:55:57,250
professional poker, Rally Car
Racing, surfing, Brazilian Jujitsu,

926
00:55:57,251 --> 00:55:58,780
and you want to see like ribs get broken.

927
00:55:58,790 --> 00:56:01,020
You can check that one
with Marcello Garcia,

928
00:56:01,021 --> 00:56:05,070
who's like the Michael Jordan of the
sport and all of them are available.

929
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:06,240
So you can get it for like,
I dunno,

930
00:56:06,241 --> 00:56:09,870
40 or 50% off if you buy
the whole season on iTunes.

931
00:56:09,930 --> 00:56:13,380
So if you go to itunes.com forward slash
Tim Ferriss with two r's and two s's,

932
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:14,101
uh,

933
00:56:14,101 --> 00:56:18,030
or if you just got a four
hour workweek.com forward
slash TV which is going to

934
00:56:18,031 --> 00:56:20,090
be, I think it's going to
be, it's going to be cheap.

935
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:24,130
Can Be like 1499 something like that
for 13 episodes. Awesome. It's really

936
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:26,530
cheap. So I'm excited. I still
haven't seen our episode.

937
00:56:26,531 --> 00:56:30,260
I know that you have it now. I got
to see it. I've been I every time,

938
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:30,971
well I should say everything,

939
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:34,000
but I've seen you hell times and I've
always brought the hard drive and you make

940
00:56:34,001 --> 00:56:34,691
fun of me because you're like,

941
00:56:34,691 --> 00:56:38,050
who walks around with a hard
drive in this day and age?

942
00:56:38,410 --> 00:56:40,150
And I'll tell you he's saying

943
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:45,730
their bitcoin information because they
don't want to have it in the cloud.

944
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:51,130
This isn't bitcoin. This is like an
episode of your freaking. But my big,

945
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:54,170
my big card, the, these episodes,

946
00:56:55,220 --> 00:57:00,040
the TV show and also not getting sued
by Turner Broadcasting for putting stuff

947
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:03,150
out that isn't or restricted,
which my rights, uh,

948
00:57:03,310 --> 00:57:07,990
requiring me to do is worth
more to me than my bitcoin.

949
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:10,480
So it makes sense that I
would take similar perception.

950
00:57:10,481 --> 00:57:12,970
This is what I said to Tim when he got
here and he's like, I have my hard drive.

951
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:15,400
I'm like, let me get a copy of that. And
he's like, no, I can't give you a copy.

952
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:16,450
I'm like,

953
00:57:16,450 --> 00:57:20,290
how can you not give me a copy in my
hard drive is encrypted the odds that

954
00:57:20,291 --> 00:57:24,280
someone hacks into my laptop and then,
well, maybe not after this episode.

955
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:29,670
And then downloads a four
gigabyte files that had,

956
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,570
it was like 10 gigs.

957
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:36,100
This is download this random video and
then puts it online where you get in

958
00:57:36,101 --> 00:57:37,180
trouble.
It's like,

959
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:41,250
it's like one in the bazillion
and you still won't do it.

960
00:57:42,130 --> 00:57:46,000
One in a bazillion. Yeah. Well, you
know, I mean you could say also,

961
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:50,830
all right, well, you know,
it's, it's, it's like,

962
00:57:50,831 --> 00:57:55,600
so the risk reward multiplied by the
probability I get, I'd get it. He's the,

963
00:57:55,870 --> 00:58:00,670
you've always been a little
paranoid. That's fine. I've
fall. Yeah, little paranoid.

964
00:58:00,671 --> 00:58:01,750
Just sort of an understatement.

965
00:58:01,751 --> 00:58:05,170
But it's just trying to be nice and I
appreciate that. So check out the show,

966
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:08,080
Tim Ferriss experiment.
It's a super proud of it.

967
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:10,240
I literally almost killed myself doing it.

968
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:12,760
And if you liked any of this
stuff in the books, you know,

969
00:58:12,761 --> 00:58:14,440
the four hour workweek for our body,
for our chef,

970
00:58:14,470 --> 00:58:19,360
all of my favorite concepts
and most powerful and
flexible principles are in the

971
00:58:19,361 --> 00:58:22,460
show. We had a lot of fun shooting in
our episode. You should check out the,

972
00:58:22,461 --> 00:58:26,500
the gun shoot. It was a pretty
intense competition. It was fun.

973
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:27,791
Really close.

974
00:58:27,791 --> 00:58:32,410
I don't want to spoil it for people
that like it was a re pretty much.

975
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:32,861
Yeah.

976
00:58:32,861 --> 00:58:36,520
Now close to like we were
in the competition and how
fast we could run through

977
00:58:36,521 --> 00:58:40,180
the course. We need to switch to
the three different guns, handgun,

978
00:58:40,181 --> 00:58:44,770
shotgun and an ar 15 and so you were,
I mean very,

979
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:48,310
very and we both got a lot
better. Yeah. Which is crazy.

980
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:50,170
So you can check it out.

981
00:58:50,171 --> 00:58:53,320
That's what the sort of savant of
the sport and in Taran Butler, who's,

982
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:54,640
that guy is shocking to me,

983
00:58:54,641 --> 00:58:59,460
loadings and saying even that is
these off the hip shooting. He isn't,

984
00:58:59,470 --> 00:59:02,890
he's like off the hip and going to hit
any target. He's basically, it's insane.

985
00:59:02,891 --> 00:59:06,040
You know, Amy, I hadn't gunning
prodigy. He can run through the course,

986
00:59:06,070 --> 00:59:11,070
get groupings like this from one to target
from the hip while running a like to

987
00:59:12,530 --> 00:59:14,830
it faster than that.
It's like you watch him,

988
00:59:14,831 --> 00:59:18,520
you'll see in the episode z
feature in there as well, I'm
sure. Right. Well, I mean,

989
00:59:18,521 --> 00:59:21,980
I know he was instructing as all Yang
and running. Absolutely. Yeah. And

990
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:22,671
you can say,
yeah,

991
00:59:22,671 --> 00:59:26,970
you remember when we did el Presidente
Day when there's like a drill where you,

992
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:31,130
you have to spin around draw, I guess
it's double tap, double tap, double tap,

993
00:59:31,310 --> 00:59:36,230
drop the MAG reload, double tap, double
tap, double tap and turn. Did it to

994
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:41,630
like 1.5, seven seconds. It was something
I remember both of us were just like,

995
00:59:42,010 --> 00:59:45,680
what?
What is so crazy?

996
00:59:45,710 --> 00:59:48,620
I wouldn't have even believed it was
the weirdest thing is a big dude.

997
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:51,700
Like the big day. Yeah. He's not
a little barrel ballerina. I mean,

998
00:59:51,701 --> 00:59:55,130
this is a solid guy and
kill us. So easy. Yeah,

999
00:59:55,131 --> 00:59:57,440
you can clear the entire time I was there,
I was like,

1000
00:59:57,470 --> 01:00:00,620
this guy could just turn around and kill
us and we have no, we couldn't even run.

1001
01:00:00,650 --> 01:00:05,420
You just make pop up on the debt. Well,
you know what was funny, I remember when,

1002
01:00:05,450 --> 01:00:08,150
uh, when we were prepping the episode
and I was like, yeah, you know,

1003
01:00:08,151 --> 01:00:10,940
I have a block 34. And, uh,

1004
01:00:10,970 --> 01:00:15,740
I wanted to become more comfortable with
the guns I already owned and the Glock

1005
01:00:15,741 --> 01:00:19,260
34 at some point I'd like to
use for competition. So, uh,

1006
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:23,360
like EPA or something like
that, the International
Defensive Pistol Association,

1007
01:00:23,361 --> 01:00:27,380
something like that. In any
case, uh, so I was talking to,

1008
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:31,180
he's talking to Taryn
beforehand and I was like, Hey,

1009
01:00:31,181 --> 01:00:33,520
is there any chance that you have
any glocks that I can use any?

1010
01:00:33,530 --> 01:00:35,290
Because I have 40 glocks.

1011
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:41,690
Of course you have 40 glocks.
Yeah. Uh, but yeah, exactly.
And he customizes these.

1012
01:00:41,691 --> 01:00:44,950
So now this is the last guy's house you'd
ever want to break. Oh my God. Cute.

1013
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:48,250
Imagine I was new. He could
take out 40 people. Oh,

1014
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:50,870
I guarantee you if like we all raided
his house and like all our friends,

1015
01:00:50,871 --> 01:00:55,090
we would all die. Oh yeah. Without
a doubt. Without a doubt. Let's see.

1016
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:58,100
When you watch the episode,
he's incredible. So anyway,

1017
01:00:58,250 --> 01:01:02,990
for each of the episodes we have some
crazy superhuman type of teacher like

1018
01:01:02,991 --> 01:01:05,230
that. For surfing it was
Laird Hamilton, you know,

1019
01:01:05,270 --> 01:01:09,410
the undisputed King of Big Wave Surfing
and on and on and on. So check it out.

1020
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:14,450
A four hour workweek.com forward
slash TV. Sweet. I think that's it.

1021
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:17,510
Suck them all off. What did,
what did Graham have to say?

1022
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:20,780
There was something you we were talking
about before we started the episode that

1023
01:01:20,781 --> 01:01:23,450
I thought was interesting. You had one
thing to say. You're like, oh blah,

1024
01:01:23,451 --> 01:01:24,970
blah blah. And I was like, oh, that's
really interesting. Grabbed me.

1025
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:28,850
She talk about on the show the fact that
everyone in this room is wearing v neck

1026
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:32,540
gray shirts. No, it wasn't
greening something else.

1027
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:36,450
Some point he had to make. Oh
Wow. It's over. Grandkids is it?

1028
01:01:36,470 --> 01:01:37,101
And you can have like,

1029
01:01:37,101 --> 01:01:40,340
you can laugh at like a 10 minute talk
at the camera after it's [inaudible].

1030
01:01:40,410 --> 01:01:43,700
It's like Graham Graham show.
You should do that sometimes.

1031
01:01:43,701 --> 01:01:47,090
We don't ever watch the entire episode.
Sexy time.

1032
01:01:47,091 --> 01:01:50,720
We can splice in Alissa.
Shots of Graham like fight club.

1033
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:53,960
Just you should splice in like a shot
of you in the bathtub with like candles

1034
01:01:53,961 --> 01:01:57,170
around. It's like Graham's little private
hour. All right, we're gonna sorry.

1035
01:01:57,260 --> 01:02:01,910
I think that's about it.
Anything else? That's it. Uh,
yeah, we'll see what was good.

1036
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:04,830
I'm heading to, uh, to New York
for a week and then I'm back.

1037
01:02:05,110 --> 01:02:07,560
I don't know where to shoot again, but
we'll figure it out. Okay. Not The people.

1038
01:02:07,561 --> 01:02:10,400
That's why it's the random show.
I'm glad any other confessions.

1039
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:14,510
Now I'm logistics updates.
All right guys,

1040
01:02:18,810 --> 01:02:19,643
Ferris

1041
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:22,710
bestselling author and Human Guinea pig.

1042
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:26,670
I'll show you how to make the impossible
possible by bending the rules.

1043
01:02:28,290 --> 01:02:32,730
I'll find the world's best teachers and
push myself to the edge to deconstruct,

1044
01:02:33,070 --> 01:02:33,903
decode,

1045
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:38,280
and demystify some of the world's
toughest challenges in record time

1046
01:02:43,330 --> 01:02:45,570
if I can do it.
So can you,

1047
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:50,640
one of the best ways to learn
something fast as to set stakes.

1048
01:02:51,030 --> 01:02:53,790
Everybody that wants you to give it up
for Mister Tim Ferriss over there now.

1049
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:56,150
So here it goes.
Hey,

1050
01:02:56,151 --> 01:03:00,660
you could feel the power rising
up in your loins five days.

1051
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:04,890
This is like the first time I looked
at Chinese characters. Zero experience,

1052
01:03:05,010 --> 01:03:08,010
you're in, you're in trouble.
Okay. And the world's best teachers

1053
01:03:09,980 --> 01:03:13,500
is four or five days were really
enough time. I have my doubts.

1054
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:19,080
Sometimes accelerated learning
requires serious acceleration.

1055
01:03:20,820 --> 01:03:23,040
The course is designed to kill you,

1056
01:03:23,850 --> 01:03:28,850
so here it goes and 50% excited
and 50% totally scared shitless.

1057
01:03:29,910 --> 01:03:34,350
Five days you've got a fitbit.
Sure. Accelerator F zero experience,

1058
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:36,030
but I'm terrified of it,
but I did not.

1059
01:03:36,031 --> 01:03:38,430
Clay would be a good driver
and the world's best teachers.

1060
01:03:41,970 --> 01:03:44,520
One mistake and you
and your car are toast.

1061
01:03:45,830 --> 01:03:47,970
Stand by camera three.

1062
01:03:49,530 --> 01:03:53,220
I've never been to the
Philippines. Sally's speak.
One word of Tagalo in that is,

1063
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:54,680
thank you Stella.

1064
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:58,860
All you're telling me we speak like
a Filipino now with language learning

1065
01:03:58,861 --> 01:04:00,090
experts on my side.

1066
01:04:00,091 --> 01:04:05,091
I will find out just how much Tagalog
I can cram in four days and this is the

1067
01:04:05,130 --> 01:04:10,080
day of reckoning for Tim.
Are you ready this week?

1068
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:11,520
I'm throwing down.

1069
01:04:14,860 --> 01:04:16,890
You're rushing past to step.

1070
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:19,970
I've got to learn fast and
it's not going to be tricky.

1071
01:04:21,030 --> 01:04:23,900
Five days to train.
I am getting a little deep

1072
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:30,390
and the world's best teachers at
least nice adjustment. What comes out.

1073
01:04:31,350 --> 01:04:32,550
All right, you ready? Let's go.

1074
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:38,340
You ready for this?
Ready is a little name this week.

1075
01:04:38,490 --> 01:04:40,380
I'll attempt to prove that man can fly

1076
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:48,120
the trees, rings that
fear into it. Five days.

1077
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:52,740
Zero experience.
The danger of permanent damage.

1078
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:54,980
He's a rope insurance and
the world's best teacher.

1079
01:04:56,790 --> 01:05:00,720
The end goal is to move into
real world environments.

1080
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:08,640
Total golf through what?
A three wood, five days.

1081
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:12,270
Zero experience and the
world's best teachers.

1082
01:05:17,230 --> 01:05:21,730
We need to clear the mind. Yeah.
Avoid catastrophes. Take a chill pill.

1083
01:05:22,020 --> 01:05:26,560
I don't
feel like I need to pass punch.

1084
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:29,400
Accelerated learning can
be applied to anything.

1085
01:05:29,580 --> 01:05:33,300
They broken down the art of attraction
to an exact sites. Really anything.

1086
01:05:34,770 --> 01:05:39,120
Having an animal, it's like crack.
Five days. I stutter, I stammer.

1087
01:05:39,121 --> 01:05:40,230
My hands are sweating.

1088
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:46,400
Millions efficiency back in ninth
grade and the world's best teachers,

1089
01:05:47,030 --> 01:05:51,360
eh? I'm sure you married
by Saturday this week.

1090
01:05:51,390 --> 01:05:54,390
I'm using my startup experience
to help a novice entrepreneur.

1091
01:05:56,390 --> 01:05:57,223
I'm a little scared.

1092
01:05:57,900 --> 01:06:02,700
I've just four days to set her on a new
path and hopefully give her the tools to

1093
01:06:02,701 --> 01:06:03,870
unlock her full potential.

1094
01:06:07,550 --> 01:06:11,960
This week it's trial by fire. Weapon is
hot, range is hot. I have to learn fast.

1095
01:06:11,990 --> 01:06:13,670
One 63 your fastest draw.

1096
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:18,590
These are going about 1280% it's
not going to be easy and he misses

1097
01:06:21,510 --> 01:06:26,420
four days to train in the world's
best teachers here to ready. Standby.

1098
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:30,110
When I say if I can do it,
so can you.

1099
01:06:30,170 --> 01:06:35,170
I mean it very literally this week up
through the learning curve as alternate a

1100
01:06:36,741 --> 01:06:38,780
novice swimmer into a
long distance swimming.

1101
01:06:39,050 --> 01:06:41,060
Every time I look at the
ways and the open water,

1102
01:06:41,061 --> 01:06:44,090
I get really nervous with help
from the master who taught me.

1103
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:47,180
I know these steps
where in just five days,

1104
01:06:48,890 --> 01:06:50,330
Sarah is struggling.

1105
01:06:56,540 --> 01:07:00,140
Sometimes to learn fast,
you have to slow way down.

1106
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:02,270
The only thing that there is is that now,

1107
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:06,110
maybe that's the most
honest way to be four days,

1108
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:08,240
one badass legend.

1109
01:07:08,630 --> 01:07:13,130
You think you haven't paddle again and
some seriously unpredictable terrain.

1110
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:17,450
Turn at Callaway. Yotam. Here we go.

1111
01:07:21,290 --> 01:07:23,060
This week I'm going all in.

1112
01:07:24,470 --> 01:07:27,150
Nothing gets me learning faster
than putting money on the line.

1113
01:07:27,380 --> 01:07:29,000
Hi and a nervous wreck.

1114
01:07:30,670 --> 01:07:35,300
I've never played a hand in
making me look very foolish here

1115
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:38,780
Liz is when my head explodes.

1116
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:48,470
If you think there's nothing you
can do when disaster strikes,

1117
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:50,380
I think again,

1118
01:07:52,940 --> 01:07:55,990
in just four days,
I'll build a toolkit for survival,

1119
01:07:57,100 --> 01:08:01,800
my end game to be ready for anything.
Oh,

1120
