many of you know, I've used 99
designs for many, many years now.

16
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,540
I've used them for book covers including
mock ups for the four hour body,

17
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:14,660
which went on to become a number one New
York Times bestseller illustrations for

18
00:01:14,661 --> 00:01:16,850
the multivolume,
the Tao of Seneca.

19
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,750
It's an ebook series basically and other
graphic design projects and I've been

20
00:01:20,751 --> 00:01:24,740
very impressed by the quality of their
designers and illustrators and you can

21
00:01:24,741 --> 00:01:28,570
check out all sorts of stuff like the Tao
of Seneca to get an idea. Uh, they're,

22
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:29,750
they're really mindboggling.

23
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:34,780
Most recently I used 99 designs to update
the illustrations and the layout of my

24
00:01:35,211 --> 00:01:36,980
five morning rituals ebook.

25
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:41,480
This is a pdf that I offer as an
incentive to get people to sign up for my

26
00:01:41,481 --> 00:01:42,314
newsletter.

27
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:46,010
The illustrations inside are gorgeous and
I loved working with a designer who we

28
00:01:46,011 --> 00:01:49,130
ended up selecting for the project.
You can take a look at that.

29
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:51,510
This is a real world example of
the type of thing that I use.

42
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,190
this episode is brought to you by
Charlotte's web, which makes a CBD oil,

43
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:54,030
a hemp extract that has become
one of my goto tools. No,

44
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:58,830
I have never really talked about CBD oil
and cannabis has never really been the

45
00:02:58,831 --> 00:03:02,590
plant for me and, and we're talking
about hemp, but nonetheless,

46
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,240
after several nights of inexplicably
insomnia, this is about a year ago,

47
00:03:07,241 --> 00:03:11,500
I just could not get to sleep, saved
my life and after other fixes failed.

48
00:03:11,501 --> 00:03:14,080
So Melatonin,
California poppy extract,

49
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:19,170
Dah Dah in elite athlete introduced me
to this non psychoactive extract and Bam,

50
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:23,200
problem solved. I had some of the
best sleep that I'd had in months.

51
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:25,480
Now I don't use sleep
aids on a daily basis,

52
00:03:25,481 --> 00:03:29,890
but this has become part of my toolkit
and I hope to be exploring other

53
00:03:29,891 --> 00:03:30,910
applications soon.

54
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:36,150
CBD oil products have exploded in
popularity in the health and wellness and

55
00:03:36,401 --> 00:03:37,234
fitness worlds.

56
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,920
And Charlotte's web is one of the top
players that offers a broad spectrum hemp

57
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:46,480
extract with CBD in the form of oils,
capsules and topical products.

58
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:50,800
Charlotte's web products will not get
you high so that maybe that is good news,

59
00:03:50,801 --> 00:03:51,581
may bad news to you,

60
00:03:51,581 --> 00:03:56,290
but it does have some powerful benefits
and applications and it works with your

61
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:58,990
body's existing endocannabinoid system.

62
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:03,800
Endo meaning from within like endo
versus Exoskeleton for instance.

63
00:04:03,801 --> 00:04:06,610
So endocannabinoid system
works with your body.

64
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:11,800
Some of the most common uses are for
relief from everyday stressors help in

65
00:04:11,801 --> 00:04:15,360
supporting restful sleep, which is
what I most often use it for. Uh,

66
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:18,490
to bring about a sense of calm and focus.
A lot of my friends use it for that.

67
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:23,260
CBD is also known or becoming known
for helping athletes to recover from

68
00:04:23,261 --> 00:04:24,730
exercise induced inflammation.

69
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,420
Charlotte's web hemp extract has
naturally occurring terpenes,

70
00:04:28,421 --> 00:04:30,610
flavonoids and other
valuable hemp compounds.

71
00:04:30,611 --> 00:04:32,770
It works synergistically to
heighten positive effects,

72
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,350
sometimes referred to
as the entourage effect,

73
00:04:35,351 --> 00:04:39,760
which you guys can look up making it
more complete than a single compound CBD

74
00:04:39,761 --> 00:04:43,300
alternatives or at least
that is what I've been told.

75
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:47,440
I do not know much about CBD alternatives
nor single compound in any case.

76
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,521
Check it out.

Well,
hello you sexy little minx.

95
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,750
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another
episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

96
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:56,040
it is my job to interview and
deconstruct world class performers.

97
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:59,960
Whether they come from the worlds
of chess, sports, business,

98
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:03,890
it really doesn't matter. We're
trying to spot patterns of excellence.

99
00:06:03,891 --> 00:06:07,160
What are the habits, the
routines, the favorite books,

100
00:06:07,161 --> 00:06:08,960
the morning exercises,

101
00:06:08,961 --> 00:06:13,280
whatever it might be that you can
test and apply in your own lives.

102
00:06:13,281 --> 00:06:17,450
And my guest today is a friend
we've been trying to make.

103
00:06:17,451 --> 00:06:22,400
The podcast happened for quite a
few years now and he is a polymath.

104
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:26,450
You need to listen to this episode.
Nick Kokona says his name,

105
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,860
last name is spelledK , o. K. O, Nas.

106
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:34,760
Nick OCONUS on Instagram at n Kokona
us on Twitter at Nick Kokonas.

107
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:39,410
Nick is the CO owner and cofounder
of the Alinea Group of restaurants,

108
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,490
which includes a linea next, the aviary
Royster. I think I'm getting that right,

109
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:47,480
and the Aviary, New York
City and YC. That is,

110
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,340
he's also the founder and
CEO of [inaudible] Inc a
reservations and CRM system

111
00:06:52,341 --> 00:06:56,600
for restaurants with more than two and a
half million diners and clients in more

112
00:06:56,601 --> 00:07:01,040
than 20 countries. Now you might be
thinking, wait a second. Restaurants food,

113
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:04,640
that's not my thing. Doesn't matter.
We're going to get into philosophy.

114
00:07:04,641 --> 00:07:06,160
We're going to get into
derivatives trading.

115
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:11,150
We're going to get into books like fooled
by randomness, the problems philosophy.

116
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:12,590
Hi.

117
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:17,740
Let's see peregrinations of an epicurean
and how nick seems to break every

118
00:07:18,681 --> 00:07:22,580
industry or type of business he goes into
and the most productive way possible.

119
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:28,040
It's a really fun conversation.
But back to the bio Alinea, a, l,

120
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:29,870
I, N, e, a, which by the way,

121
00:07:29,871 --> 00:07:32,690
I based basically an entire
section of the four hour chef on,

122
00:07:32,691 --> 00:07:35,120
which was one of my books
because I was so impressed.

123
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:39,050
Alinea has been named the best restaurant
in America and best restaurant in the

124
00:07:39,051 --> 00:07:43,190
world by organizations and lists as
diverse as the James Beard Foundation.

125
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,380
They give James Beard awards out,

126
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:49,340
which kind of like the Oscars in the
food world, world's 50 best TripAdvisor,

127
00:07:49,341 --> 00:07:51,680
Yelp,
gourmet magazine and elite traveler.

128
00:07:51,681 --> 00:07:56,681
His restaurants have won nearly every
accolade afford them despite the fact that

129
00:07:57,081 --> 00:07:57,561
uh,

130
00:07:57,561 --> 00:08:02,270
he does not or didn't at least have any
experience whatsoever in restaurants.

131
00:08:02,271 --> 00:08:04,490
And he had some amazing,
amazing partners we get into.

132
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:09,410
But that set of beginner's eyes is really,
really crucial.

133
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:14,040
And we dig into how he cultivates
that a lot. Nick has been a,

134
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:18,560
he uses this word, a subversive
entrepreneur, which I agree with.

135
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,800
And Angel investors since 1996 he
spent a decade is a very successful

136
00:08:24,891 --> 00:08:25,790
derivatives trader,

137
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:30,140
has co written three books and believes
in radical transparency and markets and

138
00:08:30,141 --> 00:08:34,310
business. His latest effort
is the aviary cocktail book,

139
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:38,510
which is perhaps the most gorgeous book
I've ever seen. I got an early copy.

140
00:08:38,511 --> 00:08:42,500
It is stunning.
It is just unbelievable what they've done.

141
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:44,390
It is self published,

142
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,600
has already sold that is presold nearly
a million dollars in copies and is being

143
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:54,821
released right now shipped right
now in October of 2018 it is truly,

144
00:08:55,891 --> 00:09:00,891
I think the most beautiful book I have
ever seen and held in my hands so you can

145
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:03,000
find out all about it.

146

Check it out so I'll leave it at that.

150
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:20,340
Please listen to this episode even
if you have no interest in food,

151
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:25,230
it doesn't matter. We span so many
different businesses, industries,

152
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,430
life lessons.

153
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:31,540
I had a blast with this and I hope
you do as well here to Nick Kokonas.

154
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:40,200
Nick, welcome to the show. Thanks Tim.
Awesome to be here finally. Yeah, yeah,

155
00:09:40,201 --> 00:09:45,201
we have the benefit of having spent some
time together and I've been fed a lot

156
00:09:45,901 --> 00:09:50,901
of caffeine by you and you're also a
great help with the four hour chef.

157
00:09:51,241 --> 00:09:54,240
So I wanted it to right off the bat.
Thank you for that.

158
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,120
It was a really lovely experience.

159
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,800
It was kind of a fun thing
cause I remember when you
sent me like a preview of

160
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:04,800
the book and then you called
me to say like, Hey, you know,

161
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,720
do you want to say anything about it?

162
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,580
And I was like on a
chairlift and I was like,

163
00:10:08,581 --> 00:10:11,250
by the time I get off this chair lift,
I will have a blurb for you

164
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,590
with such pressure. We, well,
which, which meant a lot.

165
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:21,680
And pressure I think is
the word to describe,

166
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,220
uh,
so much about you and your life.

167
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:30,090
I want to say trajectory, but I'm
not even sure that is the right word.

168
00:10:30,091 --> 00:10:34,980
And I thought a fun way to kick off
the conversation would be to share with

169
00:10:34,981 --> 00:10:35,814
people listening,

170
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,240
some of the back and forth that we had
when we were brainstorming what a podcast

171
00:10:41,281 --> 00:10:45,050
might look like.
Because certainly I,

172
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:49,710
I don't think of you first and
foremost as a food guy per se.

173
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,570
And we were,

174
00:10:51,571 --> 00:10:55,770
we were having this exchange
via text and then via email.

175
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:01,280
And I thought I'd just read one of your
responses as we were swapping different

176
00:11:01,591 --> 00:11:06,210
ideas and uh, I, I, I'll probably
edit for space a little bit here,

177
00:11:06,211 --> 00:11:08,610
but not by much.
And here we go.

178
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,640
I'm a huge believer in radical
transparency in business.

179
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,330
I give numbers and burn bridges with big
companies because I think that a lot of

180
00:11:15,331 --> 00:11:19,080
times people don't ask the basic
questions and publishing, for instance,

181
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:22,530
how much did that book cost to
print? How many did it sell? Oddly,

182
00:11:22,531 --> 00:11:26,250
those numbers are very hard to come by.
I dug for months,

183
00:11:26,251 --> 00:11:29,400
years ago to do the Alinea
book the right way for bars.

184
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,460
Why does a bartender wash
dishes and talk to customers?

185
00:11:32,461 --> 00:11:36,870
We've redesigned the bar experience in
one best bar in the world for restaurants.

186
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:41,640
Why is it the only form of entertainment
that has only mutual promise to show up

187
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,190
and then it goes into behavioral
economics and in parentheses,

188
00:11:44,191 --> 00:11:46,980
I don't even know how to pronounce his
last name correctly, Richard Thaler,

189
00:11:46,981 --> 00:11:47,814
or is it Taylor?

190
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:51,510
Taylor is a friend and investor
just won the Nobel prize investing,

191
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:53,440
been beating the market
for nearly 30 years.

192
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:58,360
Everything in all caps is about asymmetric
risk taking in information and yet

193
00:11:58,361 --> 00:11:59,080
people,

194
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:03,760
people's perception of risk or
of what I do is that it's risky.

195
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:07,870
It is not.
And a in a separate exchange,

196
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:13,180
when we were talking about many of the
topics that you could talk about outside

197
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:15,550
of say restaurants,
bars and so on,

198
00:12:15,551 --> 00:12:18,370
even though that's been a big part
of your life in reason, history,

199
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,920
many of these different experiments,
explorations, portions of your career,

200
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:27,160
topics that you could talk about
and then going into what you said,

201
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:28,750
they come down to a single thought,

202
00:12:28,751 --> 00:12:32,560
really wherever there is opaque
information that should be obvious,

203
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,850
run to that gap.

204
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,180
So I struggle with where
to even begin with the 20,

205
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:44,410
the 20 options that we have here.
But maybe you, maybe you could,

206
00:12:44,411 --> 00:12:49,411
maybe you could explain to
me how behavioral economics
and Richard Thaler fit

207
00:12:50,711 --> 00:12:55,480
into this. Uh, just just
for curiosity's sake.

208
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:56,850
Yeah. I mean, well,

209
00:12:56,851 --> 00:13:00,200
I'll go back to the word you used
options because I started out, um,

210
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:04,080
back in 1992 or three studying options,

211
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,150
trading derivatives trading.

212
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,720
And I think there's a huge misconception
about what that is because of movies,

213
00:13:13,141 --> 00:13:17,850
because of the big short, because of,
you know, Wall Street, all of that. Um,

214
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,540
it's a bit like playing a game of chess
for a living or being the house at a

215
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:25,030
casino, that sort of thing.
It's about taking, you know,

216
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:29,700
hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
decision per day and pretending it's like

217
00:13:29,701 --> 00:13:34,680
a big decision tree. And any given
decision is, is probably got, you know,

218
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:39,240
if you're really good, 48% chance
of being wrong. So you have to be,

219
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,021
you have to be really,

220
00:13:40,021 --> 00:13:45,021
really good at constantly
being comfortable being wrong.

221
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,600
But knowing that your overall number of,

222
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:52,430
of decisions that you're going
to be right more than Iran.

223
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:56,580
And so like I know there's
like a big theme, a lot of
the folks that you have on,

224
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:59,700
like they talked about success or
failure or how to measure those things.

225
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:03,240
And I kind of don't look at it as
a success or failure with anything.

226
00:14:03,241 --> 00:14:07,830
I look at it as just like
is my pattern of decisions.

227
00:14:07,831 --> 00:14:09,450
Correct.
Um,

228
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:13,530
and then getting back to your actual
question with Professor Thaler and

229
00:14:13,531 --> 00:14:17,220
behavioral economics, and I mean
essentially what they're looking at is,

230
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:21,510
is decision making, what drives
people to make certain decisions?

231
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,550
What's rational about those decisions?

232
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:28,580
What is mostly irrational or emotional
or what decisions do we make that people

233
00:14:29,221 --> 00:14:33,210
don't even realize they're making a
decision, which is often the case as well.

234
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:37,920
And then if you think about it, every
single form of what we do, art, commerce,

235
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:42,720
science, you know, I'm picking
a mate, like all those things,

236
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:43,560
um,

237
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:48,330
it comes down to a whole
bunch of decisions that you
make without often really

238
00:14:48,331 --> 00:14:51,800
thinking about the decision itself.
Um,

239
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,110
not that you can go around
walking around going, wow,

240
00:14:54,111 --> 00:14:58,920
I've just made another decision, but when
you are doing, you know, business or,

241
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:02,390
or starting a company or publishing
a book or whatever it may be,

242
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:06,890
you can be intentional about that and
realize that it's going to be an iterative

243
00:15:06,891 --> 00:15:08,780
process.
And so I think that's,

244
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:14,450
that's been not only the case for me in
learning how to filter things through

245
00:15:14,451 --> 00:15:18,920
that mindset. But you like when you
said there isn't really a trajectory,

246
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:22,580
like I kind of look at everything
I've done is, is the same in a way,

247
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,890
even though other people
look at it and go like, wow,

248
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:28,610
you went from being a derivatives
trader to owning restaurants.

249
00:15:28,611 --> 00:15:31,910
Like that's weird. And I
studied philosophy in college,
so like people are like,

250
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,010
how do you go from philosophy to finance,
you know?

251
00:15:34,011 --> 00:15:35,720
And to me it was all the same thing.

252
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:41,660
How was that that particular transition
or rather a progression I suppose from

253
00:15:44,491 --> 00:15:48,830
philosophy to finance is one that you and
I haven't really talked about and that

254
00:15:48,831 --> 00:15:50,090
that one is interesting too.

255
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:54,000
I'd love to explore for a second and
we're going to go into a million different

256
00:15:54,001 --> 00:15:54,834
nooks and crannies.

257
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:00,720
Was Do you feel like philosophy was
studying philosophy undergrad was an asset

258
00:16:01,981 --> 00:16:05,850
that then leader helped you or was it
just an interest you explored on route to

259
00:16:05,851 --> 00:16:06,684
other things?

260
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:11,450
No, I, I can't remotely imagine
having not not done that.

261
00:16:11,451 --> 00:16:13,700
And the way that actually I
did it was really interesting.

262
00:16:13,701 --> 00:16:17,000
I had no intention of when I got to
college I thought I'd study political

263
00:16:17,001 --> 00:16:21,850
science, economics, pre law kind of
thing, something like that. And um,

264
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:25,070
my very like second week
at Colgate University,

265
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:29,000
a wonderful professor who just passed
away last year at 94 years old,

266
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:31,940
really great mentor to me,
Professor Jerome Bel Myth,

267
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:36,210
I was a tenured professor at Colgate for
almost 60 years. Pulled me aside, um,

268
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:40,250
introduction to logic one o one,
and basically said, what do you,

269
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:44,840
what are you studying here? And
uh, I told him and he said, nope,

270
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:47,480
you're going to be a philosophy major.
I'm going to tell you,

271
00:16:47,481 --> 00:16:51,320
I'm going to teach you how to think. Um,
and, and he would, he was the kind of guy,

272
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:55,190
like, there's like, there's
this great scene in a river
runs through it where the,

273
00:16:55,250 --> 00:17:00,050
where the dad, you know, every time the
kid writes an essay, like the young,

274
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,040
uh,
you know,

275
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:05,270
fishermen kid writes an essay and he
brings it to his father to be graded.

276
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,760
He gives it back to him and
says half as long again.

277
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:12,320
And that's like long before
that movie ever came out, um,

278
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,520
professor Balmouth would,

279
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:16,640
would essentially assigned a paper to
the class and say it should be about 15

280
00:17:16,641 --> 00:17:19,940
pages. And people would be like, well, how
long? And he'd always say like, you know,

281
00:17:19,941 --> 00:17:22,460
how long has the piece of string?
Like it's however long it needs to be.

282
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:27,380
And then he would tell me years can't
be longer than three pages. And,

283
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:29,120
and people would be
like jealous. Like, wow,

284
00:17:29,121 --> 00:17:33,110
you only have to write three pages if
you take it seriously. That is a much,

285
00:17:33,111 --> 00:17:34,430
much harder thing to do.

286
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:39,790
So he really trained me as well as a
number of other professors there to be

287
00:17:40,461 --> 00:17:44,350
clear and thinking succinct to,
to you know,

288
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:48,620
understand what logic was to process
information and really to look for

289
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:53,130
parallels in different fields and
different fields of thought. Um,

290
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,800
and so man,
like when I got out of school,

291
00:17:55,801 --> 00:18:00,180
I went to law school for like a day
and a half. I don't need to pay.

292
00:18:00,181 --> 00:18:04,950
I got into Penn like a joint JD PhD
program at Penn and as soon as I kind of

293
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:07,380
knew who the other folks
were and what their,

294
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,290
their desires and trajectories
where I was like, oh,

295
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,570
this isn't actually a
good fit for me. And, um,

296
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,200
I remember my future father in law told
my now wife then girlfriend that I was

297
00:18:18,781 --> 00:18:22,260
in danger of becoming an
intellectual bum because I,

298
00:18:22,261 --> 00:18:25,950
I dropped out of a dropped out of law
school before I really entered law school.

299
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:31,020
And, um, you know, I floundered around
for a little while. Um, but you know,

300
00:18:31,021 --> 00:18:34,800
if you grew up in Chicago,
you end up meeting people who,

301
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:39,570
who had this unusual lifestyle. And that
was back in the days pre, pre Internet,

302
00:18:39,571 --> 00:18:41,670
pre,
pre electronic trading.

303
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:45,390
I'm pretty high frequency trading where
there was literally people on a giant

304
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:50,420
trading floor that shouting at each other
and you either were attracted to the,

305
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:55,050
I don't know, almost
animalistic nature of that. Um,

306
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:59,490
and for me it was like a huge challenge
because there are people down there that

307
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:04,000
were, had phd's from Mit and then there
was people who were like, you know,

308
00:19:04,001 --> 00:19:08,640
butchers that went down there with
$100,000 and just kicked ass. And, and,

309
00:19:08,641 --> 00:19:09,330
and so it was,

310
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:13,440
it wasn't about your level of education
or any of the stuff I already talked

311
00:19:13,441 --> 00:19:13,980
about.

312
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:18,980
It was about can you show up every day
and every day is game day and be really

313
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,750
disciplined and very clear,

314
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:26,100
headed in with chaos around you and
you get introduced to that world.

315
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,490
You know, if you grow
up in Chicago, you know,

316
00:19:29,491 --> 00:19:33,570
some of these guys and some of them
are flashy and I can remember the exact

317
00:19:33,571 --> 00:19:37,530
moment, and I'm not going to name a name
here as you'll find out why in a second.

318
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:41,270
But I was walking down the
street. I, I was like, you know,

319
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,800
six months out of college, kind of
didn't know what I was going to do.

320
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,640
And I was walking down the street and
I bumped into Guy I knew in high school

321
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:52,650
and you know, he wasn't the best
student. He didn't try the hardest.

322
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:56,220
And I was like, Hey, what are you
doing now? And, and he was like, well,

323
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:59,190
I'm just rehabbing these homes.
I thought literally like, oh,

324
00:19:59,191 --> 00:20:02,820
he's a construction worker.
And I was like, you know,
what are you doing with him?

325
00:20:02,821 --> 00:20:07,350
And he's like, well, I just bought
this block. I'm turning this all over.

326
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:10,260
This is a true story, but
this is so not like, you know,

327
00:20:10,261 --> 00:20:13,920
a good reason to do something. But,
but I looked at him and I was like,

328
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:16,380
what are you talking about? And
he's like, yeah, I skipped college.

329
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:20,310
And I started out as a runner on the
floor of the merch. And now I, you know,

330
00:20:20,311 --> 00:20:25,311
I own like 25 condos and
three town homes and I trade.

331
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,750
And I kind of went like, wow, you know,

332
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,750
I don't know what I knew
a little bit about it.

333
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:34,290
I'd been down on the floor before it
just visiting, but I was kind of like,

334
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:39,610
that's fascinating life. That is
truly fascinating thing. And you know,

335
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:41,250
I, I went down, visited the floor,

336
00:20:41,251 --> 00:20:46,200
I had to fake my resume in the wrong
direction to get a job. That's true story.

337
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,280
Um, like people lie on
their resume all the time.

338
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:52,430
I'm probably the only person that got rid
of like, you know, my degree in my, my,

339
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:56,050
uh, academic awards and
all that because you know,

340
00:20:56,051 --> 00:20:57,430
to get a clerk job on the floor,

341
00:20:57,431 --> 00:21:00,610
the last thing they wanted was someone
with a good degree, Phi Beta Kappa,

342
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:04,420
magna cum laude, all that
stuff. Um, so I faked my resume,

343
00:21:04,421 --> 00:21:06,160
got a $5 an hour job
and look for a mentor.

344
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:10,830
And I found a guy named Frank Serino who,
um,

345
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,640
was it Chicago research and trading,
who's,

346
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:17,530
which also was founded by a philosophy
major. It's actually very common. And,

347
00:21:17,531 --> 00:21:22,060
um, why is that common? I
don't wish I knew the answer.

348
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,140
I don't know the answer.

349
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:26,440
I do know that there's three or four of
the largest trading firms in the world,

350
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:29,260
uh, run by philosophy majors. Um,

351
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:33,020
and if you look back at my,

352
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,910
my class just of of, you know,
there's a few professors in there,

353
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,780
but there are people who make movies.
There's a guy who runs an ad agency,

354
00:21:40,781 --> 00:21:43,000
a large ad agency like it was,

355
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:46,000
it's a really interesting path.

356
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:49,300
It's not dislike studying physics,
you know,

357
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:54,100
like I know some great physicists who,
who are great in whatever they do.

358
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:59,020
And I think it's, I think it's a
similar discipline of abstract thought.

359
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:02,710
Like I can't think of anything
worse than studying business.

360
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:07,840
It just seems like a terrible
thing to study to me.

361
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:14,200
Is that because it's like the surface
of the waves in the ocean topically,

362
00:22:14,201 --> 00:22:18,400
it's just so
nontransferable in a sense.

363
00:22:18,401 --> 00:22:22,600
And then as you go lower and lower to the,
it's going to slower moving layers.

364
00:22:22,601 --> 00:22:26,140
That's just more multidisciplinary
in terms of studying,

365
00:22:26,141 --> 00:22:29,820
like the basics of how things work or
how people think. Yeah, I think it's,

366
00:22:29,821 --> 00:22:33,160
it's almost like it's how to do
something or how to manage something,

367
00:22:33,161 --> 00:22:37,330
but not why to do it.
Right. And, and so if,

368
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,950
if you're taught in 1992,
if I went and got an Mba,

369
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:46,090
I would have been taught a certain kind
of management that six years later with

370
00:22:46,091 --> 00:22:50,470
the Internet would have gotten
blown up. And so for me, it's like,

371
00:22:50,471 --> 00:22:54,800
I always ask the why question,
you know, um, when were, you know,

372
00:22:54,801 --> 00:22:59,530
you were mentioning like the book
publishing or, or a bar, like, you know,

373
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,990
I just looked at some things
and just go like, why is that?

374
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:04,630
Why is it work that way?
Um,

375
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:09,690
and oftentimes the people most entrenched
in the system have no idea why they

376
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:13,450
like the third or fourth generation
of person within that system.

377
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:17,320
And they have no idea why a school
bell rings in the morning, for example,

378
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:21,810
or why a bartender is washing the dishes.
Um,

379
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:25,870
and often I don't know the real answer.
Um, but I come up with alternative ones,

380
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:28,060
at least that student find narrative,
I guess

381
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:34,630
undervalued skill, by the
way, in some cases, right.
You gotta be careful, but, uh,

382
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:40,230
very, uh, uh, very, very, very,
very, very interesting. I, I,

383
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,081
I want to pause.

384
00:23:41,081 --> 00:23:44,470
You're partially because I'm over
caffeinated and it was inspired by my

385
00:23:44,471 --> 00:23:46,120
nostalgia related

386
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,730
to your double expressors up.

387
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:51,590
But why did the professor pull you aside?

388
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:56,830
What did that early undergrad
professor in logic one o one c in you,

389
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:59,450
whether he explained it or not later,
I don't know,

390
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:03,500
that led him to take a
special interest in you.

391
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:05,980
Well, I, you know, I think,

392
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:10,000
I think I was prepared in earnest
because I was mostly terrified.

393
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:15,430
Um, you know, he had a reputation
of being kind of like a, um,

394
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:20,530
you know,
he is a Socratic method teacher.

395
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,790
He was pretty harsh.
Um,

396
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:27,810
Colgate was very small classes and there
was a class of 80 people and he kind of

397
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:30,400
wanted to widdle it down to
a more manageable number.

398
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:35,260
And his method to do that was just
to kick your ass. And I, I remember,

399
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:38,710
I mean he probably as great as he was,
he,

400
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:43,150
I doubt he would survive starting
out at a college campus now. I mean,

401
00:24:43,151 --> 00:24:43,780
I've literally,

402
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:47,290
I literally saw him like fire to
someone's notebook once when he was asking

403
00:24:47,291 --> 00:24:49,450
people like examples of
how to put out a fire.

404
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:51,850
And this one guy was just
stuttering cause he was so unfair.

405
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:54,890
And so you just lose notebook
on fire and you stamped it.

406
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:58,240
And the kid threw it on the ground stamp
down. He's like, you could smother it.

407
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:02,290
And he called everyone,
he memorized every person's last name.

408
00:25:02,291 --> 00:25:06,630
And it was Mr and Ms. And um, I
remember the specific day, um,

409
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,190
he was literally at, you know, back to
the, there's like right out of a movie.

410
00:25:11,191 --> 00:25:14,440
He is back to the class writing
on a chalkboard, you know, some,

411
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:18,970
some logic problems, symbolic
logic. And um, the guy next to me,

412
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:23,920
um, uh, had no shot at getting
it right and done, done right.

413
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:27,550
And so he,
he said his name and um,

414
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,590
and I wrote on the paper on my
desk so he could see it, like what,

415
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:35,020
what the answer was. And then without
missing a beat or turning around,

416
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,210
he was like, Mister conus,
please do not help him.

417
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:41,750
There's no way in hell he could possibly
have done that without your help. And,

418
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,780
and this is like two or three weeks in.
Right.

419
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:49,150
And he spun around and he saw that
I didn't have my book and he said,

420
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:53,170
Mr Dakota's, where's your book? And I
said, it's at my, it's in my dorm room,

421
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:56,620
you know, professor. And he said, well, a
lot of good, it's doing you there. I said,

422
00:25:56,621 --> 00:26:01,060
on the contrary, it must apparently be
doing me a lot of good there. And he said,

423
00:26:01,061 --> 00:26:02,200
I'll see you after class.

424
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:06,430
So I thought I was getting kicked out
and there was like a line forming to

425
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:09,730
create office hours or like asked
to be transferred out or whatever.

426
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:12,640
And when I got to the
front, he said, follow me.

427
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:16,420
And I followed him to his office
and I swear, I mean he's, you know,

428
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:19,570
running through the fall,
New England fall.

429
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:23,230
And I thought I was going to get kicked
out of the class and when I closed the

430
00:26:23,231 --> 00:26:25,690
door I turned around, he has for
you up on the desk. And he said,

431
00:26:25,691 --> 00:26:29,500
where are you from? What do you
want to do here? And that was it.

432
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:35,020
He took me under his wing. I was
very fortunate. I, um, and you know,

433
00:26:35,021 --> 00:26:37,420
it's like I never knew.
Here's the amazing part.

434
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:41,800
I never knew the guy liked me until 10
years after I graduated and then I was

435
00:26:41,801 --> 00:26:44,010
treated like a member
of his and his funeral

436
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:47,610
30 years later. Huh. Right.
So really fascinating.

437
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,650
A person really fascinating,
uh, you know, uh,

438
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:55,440
a moment in my life
where, um, I don't know,

439
00:26:55,441 --> 00:26:57,180
someone saw something in
me and kind of went like,

440
00:26:57,181 --> 00:27:00,570
I'm going to make an investment in this
person and never asked for anything back,

441
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:04,200
you know, ever. How did you
not know that he liked you?

442
00:27:04,201 --> 00:27:09,201
Did he withhold in some ways so that
you wouldn't get a big head or something

443
00:27:09,541 --> 00:27:10,560
along those lines?

444
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:14,260
I did he not want to get too overly
attached to you so he wouldn't express it?

445
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:18,930
No, I, I think I was 19 years old and
I didn't know that the people you like,

446
00:27:18,931 --> 00:27:23,430
you hold to a higher standard probably.
Right. Um, and so consequently,

447
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:28,380
uh, you know, I like, it was really like,
he beat the shit out of me in a good way.

448
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,900
You know what I mean?
He,

449
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:33,900
it's like if you have someone
who's teaching you something
and they invest their

450
00:27:33,901 --> 00:27:36,990
time in you and they think you
have a chance of being good,

451
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:40,110
they work you harder than
the folks around you.

452
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,820
So the people that I thought he liked,

453
00:27:41,821 --> 00:27:43,440
he was just being nice
too because they didn't,

454
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:46,590
he didn't think they had a chance,
you know? Yeah. He didn't care.

455
00:27:46,591 --> 00:27:51,180
It wasn't invested. Yeah. And, and so
with, with me, I think it would be like,

456
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:54,810
he wouldn't be talking to
my English professor without
me even knowing and being

457
00:27:54,811 --> 00:27:57,600
like, you know, that paper sucks.
He can do a lot better than that.

458
00:27:57,601 --> 00:28:02,280
Give them a c on that one. And it was
just like, I was like, what's going on?

459
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:06,990
Like all of a sudden that class got
hard. I didn't know. I had no idea. Um,

460
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,830
and uh, it was just, it was
an interesting, uh, lucky,

461
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,940
fortunate place to be at that time.

462
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:20,730
So we're going to get back to the mark.
But before we do philosophy,

463
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:23,520
I'm endlessly fascinated by philosophy,

464
00:28:23,521 --> 00:28:27,180
but I'm also a nerd and kind of academic
and pedantic and have spent a lot of

465
00:28:27,181 --> 00:28:32,181
time in school for people
who are listening to this
who are say already in their

466
00:28:32,521 --> 00:28:36,060
careers or maybe they're in their early
twenties thinking of starting a company

467
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:40,320
but are entrepreneurially
either involved or inclined,

468
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:45,350
would you suggest if they don't have any
exposure to philosophy that they read

469
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,020
any particular books or resources
or explore it in any way?

470
00:28:49,021 --> 00:28:50,250
Or would you say actually,
you know what,

471
00:28:50,251 --> 00:28:52,140
that was an intermediate
step to something else.

472
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:56,100
You would probably be better
off studying x, Y and Z.

473
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:00,000
Is there like a starter kit or something
you would recommend to folks who don't

474
00:29:00,001 --> 00:29:04,470
have the philosophy exposure?
You know,

475
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:09,060
I think part of it is if you
read a book in isolation, um,

476
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:14,330
it's not as rich of an
experience as discussing those
ideas within that context.

477
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:16,320
That said,
if it's,

478
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:19,800
if you're the kind of person that
loves to read and explore ideas,

479
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:23,850
I mean there's hardly a better place.
It's a matter of finding what you enjoy.

480
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:28,410
Um, you know, I happen to love,
um, the problems of philosophy,

481
00:29:28,411 --> 00:29:32,400
which Bertrand Russel wrote, um,
sort of about Victor's dines ideas,

482
00:29:32,401 --> 00:29:36,730
but before Vichtenstein
published, um, and it's,

483
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:41,380
it's written in plain language.
It's not hard to understand. Um,

484
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,000
certainly need

485
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Jay is more like philosophy with some
weird sugar coating of something on top of

486
00:29:47,861 --> 00:29:52,390
it. Um, and man, like as
a young male, you know,

487
00:29:52,391 --> 00:29:57,200
reading Nietzsche, that for
the first time, I was like,
fuck yeah. You know, like,

488
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,680
like,
it's not like it's that passive,

489
00:29:59,681 --> 00:30:03,400
like I think people think of philosophers
as like Zen monks sitting there

490
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:06,570
quietly contemplating the
universe. Um, I think what it is,

491
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:10,390
is it's people grappling with all of
the same questions and curiosity that,

492
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:15,420
that we all have. If you pause to
think about it. And so there, it's,

493
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:19,930
it's so big, you know, um, that it's,
it's not just, you know, Descartes,

494
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:24,760
I think therefore I am, it's, it's,
it's kind of every little bit of that,

495
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:29,410
um, back to like, you know, read
Luke reaches like he had the atomic.

496
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:34,440
Could you spell that? I'm going to do this
first one to admit that increase. Yes.

497
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:39,330
Yeah. I mean, you know, he,
Luc, R, I t I. U s yeah,

498
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:43,980
I'm a terrible speller, so never asked
me to it. We'll put it in the show notes.

499
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:47,470
Right, right. But like, you
know, it's like you read,

500
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:52,060
read that or read this great book called
the swerve, which you know, is, is uh,

501
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:55,840
you know about this, this
monk ages ago. Um, that,

502
00:30:56,140 --> 00:31:01,140
that sort of found that book and then
rewrote it and saved it for history.

503
00:31:01,181 --> 00:31:02,890
Like that reads like a murder mystery.

504
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,810
Like you don't necessarily need
to start with the philosophy.

505
00:31:04,811 --> 00:31:07,900
You can start with the things
around it. Um, but I, you know,

506
00:31:07,901 --> 00:31:12,901
it's like I continue to find sort of the
world of ideas endlessly inspirational

507
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:16,960
and, and then by the way, you know,

508
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:20,100
steal them and use them in
whatever you're doing like that.

509
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:20,980
They're there for you.

510
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:25,980
The Cretia, Luc, r e t, I,

511
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,130
U s Titus Lucretius Charisse was
a Roman poet and philosopher.

512
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:34,660
We'll put that in the show notes. The,
I want to second Bertrand Russell. Also,

513
00:31:34,661 --> 00:31:37,720
I haven't read Bertrand
Russell and so many ages,

514
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:42,070
but it is very digestible.

515
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:47,190
It is not dressed up in $10 words
when 10 cent words would suffice.

516
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:53,500
Uh, a lot of his writing
is, is really powerful.

517
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:57,220
And I also just wanted to
mention for folks that,

518
00:31:57,221 --> 00:32:00,340
and I just thought about
this ages and ages ago,

519
00:32:00,341 --> 00:32:05,341
I felt like I had certain
gaps in my education,

520
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,100
uh,
after college and I ended up,

521
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,990
I don't know why this
didn't occur to me earlier,

522
00:32:10,991 --> 00:32:15,580
but somebody mentioned that Stanford,
UC Berkeley,

523
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:20,610
these top tier universities all had
extended or adult education classes taught

524
00:32:22,061 --> 00:32:24,750
by professors in junior professors.
I mean these,

525
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:29,170
this is the same team
who's teaching and uh,

526
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:31,780
those are very readily accessible.

527
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:33,840
Well and even MIT open courseware,

528
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:38,930
like so many colleges now have
taken that model and put great,

529
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:41,990
great classes online.
Um,

530
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:45,770
and I know that every now and
then I'm surprised what I,

531
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:49,970
what I find on there and get
sucked into like an all nighter of,

532
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:54,560
of taking some college class, you
know, that I know nothing about.

533
00:32:54,561 --> 00:32:58,280
And it's so far over my head, but it
kind of refuels you again to go like, oh,

534
00:32:58,281 --> 00:33:02,060
like there are huge gaps
where I know nothing.

535
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:05,310
And the older you get,
the harder it is to,

536
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:08,790
to start into something
new, I find at least, um,

537
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,750
because it feels like the
mountains too big. You know,

538
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:16,960
I would, I would actually,
uh, not, not to pull a nick.

539
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:21,460
Actually on the contrary,
on the contrary, sir,

540
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,680
my book is doing me a lot
of good in my dorm room.

541
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:29,460
I think one of your superpowers is that
you ask the fundamental why questions

542
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:37,830
about long standing assumptions or a
conventional wisdom in different fields.

543
00:33:39,971 --> 00:33:41,440
And the more you have done that,

544
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:45,730
the more obvious it is to you
to do it as a starting point,

545
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:50,550
uh, in, in a way. So let's
go back to the Merck. Uh, we,

546
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,790
we can go in any direction
of course, but yeah, you,

547
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:59,030
you get used to step into this lord of
the flies slash gladiatorial arena with

548
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:03,670
butchers and phd.
He is and so on.

549
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:08,320
Then what like at what point is
there a point when you're like, okay,

550
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,050
I actually do think I
could be good at this?

551
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:17,410
No, I for real, no,

552
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,610
I was down there and I,

553
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:25,270
I had made a fatal error of leaving
school and everyone told me it was a fatal

554
00:34:26,571 --> 00:34:31,550
error and um, this is leading the
little school. Yeah. And, and I,

555
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:36,710
I,
I remember being down there and you know,

556
00:34:36,711 --> 00:34:38,390
what I was doing was so brainless.

557
00:34:38,391 --> 00:34:41,390
It was literally you take this piece of
paper over to that guy and then that guy

558
00:34:41,391 --> 00:34:43,970
would yell at you and you'd rip the paper
out of your hand and then you go get

559
00:34:43,971 --> 00:34:44,420
another one.

560
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:49,420
It was literally that dead
and I was desperately looking
to learn what was going

561
00:34:50,031 --> 00:34:51,860
on around me.
Um,

562
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:56,420
and of course I bought books on finance
and commodities and options and all that

563
00:34:56,421 --> 00:35:00,860
and they were completely ridiculous and
opaque and academic that it looked like

564
00:35:00,861 --> 00:35:04,880
they had no relationship to what
was going on there at all. Um,

565
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:09,200
I started taking classes that were run
at the merch on mock trading and just

566
00:35:09,201 --> 00:35:11,420
learning the hand signals
and things like that,

567
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:15,560
which were fine but didn't
really teach you how to trade.

568
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:20,770
And I spent time interviewing with big
companies like Goldman Sachs and society

569
00:35:22,581 --> 00:35:26,930
in general and whatnot because I did have
the academic background where I would

570
00:35:26,931 --> 00:35:29,030
get the interview,
I would be able to take the test,

571
00:35:29,031 --> 00:35:31,130
I would do well in their
math and psychology tests.

572
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:34,810
I would get offered a job as a trader.
Uh,

573
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:37,100
and then I would look at the contract.

574
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:41,190
This is a key thing people get out
of college to get offered a job.

575
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,770
I think I'm the only one who ever
read the employment contract.

576
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:47,220
And what it said in there was basically
like they can do anything they want with

577
00:35:47,221 --> 00:35:50,630
me for three years. Like I don't even
necessarily need to be a trader like I,

578
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:53,100
that's why I was interested in doing,
but they could,

579
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:55,800
they could ship me to France and have
me do something totally different.

580
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,200
I can be an analyst or you know,
God knows what.

581
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:01,050
And so when I would question
that, there'd be like, man,

582
00:36:01,051 --> 00:36:02,280
you should be really happy.
Like,

583
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:06,360
we had 300 applicants for
this and we offered eight
positions, like just take it.

584
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,140
And I was kind of like totally your style,

585
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:14,620
kind of like, you know, I,
I grew up, you know, like,

586
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:18,680
I'd be remiss not to say
that like my dad modeled, um,

587
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:23,630
my dad was an entrepreneur by necessity
because his dad died when he was really

588
00:36:23,631 --> 00:36:26,430
young.
He fought both at the end of World War II.

589
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,770
He was drafted into the navy
at the end of World War Two,

590
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:31,320
was dismissed honorably after 16,

591
00:36:31,321 --> 00:36:33,390
18 months because they
were downsizing the navy.

592
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:38,370
And then he was barely young enough to
be drafted into the army for the Korean

593
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:42,840
War. And when he got out, like,
you know, he had no usable skills.

594
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,390
So he went to work at the grocery store
that he started working at when he was

595
00:36:45,391 --> 00:36:46,224
12 years old,

596
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:50,520
save the ball of his money from the
army and the navy and bought the store.

597
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:54,990
And so as I was growing up, uh, you know,

598
00:36:54,991 --> 00:36:59,720
my hero was my dad who was not
an academic, who was not, um,

599
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:03,330
what people would think of as like
an executive and a suit or whatever,

600
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:06,790
but did really well. Um,
you know, he had, uh, uh,

601
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:09,750
bought property in real estate.
He,

602
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:14,460
he owned a temporary labor office that's
applied on skilled laborers to factory

603
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:19,200
and conventions and whatnot. Um, that
was a really good business, you know,

604
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:22,190
and he had a lot of common sense smarts.
Um,

605
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:25,200
he was horrified that I didn't
go to law school, you know,

606
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:30,030
but meanwhile I was modeling what he did.
And so when I got down there,

607
00:37:30,031 --> 00:37:33,850
I was like, you got to own, you have to
own your own situation, you know? Um,

608
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,570
and so when I was offered
those jobs, I was like, well,

609
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:40,110
I don't really see myself working
for someone else, you know?

610
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:45,740
And I found a guy who also felt that
way and he was working for a big company

611
00:37:47,851 --> 00:37:51,630
and they didn't want to make him a trader
because he was too much of a quant.

612
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:54,120
Like he was really well educated.
He was really mathematical.

613
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:56,190
He wanted to prove them wrong.

614
00:37:56,191 --> 00:38:00,000
So he took a small amount of money
and started trading currency options.

615
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:01,410
And when I found him,

616
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:05,910
I instantly knew that this was the right
person because I talked to dozens of

617
00:38:05,911 --> 00:38:07,830
people and no one was like him.

618
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:13,350
And then he said he didn't want to hire
me. Like, do you want to hire anyone?

619
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:15,730
How did you meet him?
Do you remember how you guys,

620
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:20,240
I was just introduced to him through, he
was back then, they were, you know, it's,

621
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,920
if you're a trader, um,
or even a trading company,

622
00:38:22,921 --> 00:38:25,210
you have a clearing firm
like Goldman Sachs. Um,

623
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:27,940
at the time there was a company
called first options, um,

624
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:31,740
and he cleared first options and back
then you literally have to take the

625
00:38:31,741 --> 00:38:36,220
elevator up to keep punching in all of
the cards into like a computer that was,

626
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:41,350
you know, up on 17 floors away.
Um, you know, wow. Ancient Times.

627
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:45,640
And uh, I met him through, uh,
being introduced to him there. Uh,

628
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:49,900
after talking to him, I knew he was
a sort of Geeky intellectual that I,

629
00:38:49,901 --> 00:38:51,410
that I needed.
Um,

630
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:55,060
and then when he told me that he didn't
want to hire me cause he just heard some

631
00:38:55,061 --> 00:38:59,840
clerk, I was like, no, no, no,
no, no, like I will pay you
to work for you. And he was,

632
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:05,400
he was like, this is really strange,
you know. And I explained to him,

633
00:39:05,401 --> 00:39:09,170
like I said, it's like I look up video
six months, I set a goal for myself of,

634
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:11,890
of getting, you know, becoming
like getting on a badge.

635
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:14,410
It was called like leasing a seat
and actually trading within a year.

636
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,200
And I was like,
I need to get going on this.

637
00:39:17,201 --> 00:39:20,600
Like I need someone that's going
to teach me options. And um,

638
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:25,360
it's fascinating because, you know,
he, he then hired me for, I mean,

639
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:30,340
I want to say it was $400 a week or
something like that. And, uh, you know,

640
00:39:30,341 --> 00:39:32,350
I stood right next to him all day,

641
00:39:32,351 --> 00:39:36,640
every day and he taught me options,
theory from scratch,

642
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:41,380
better than any college ever could.
Um, to the point where you're looking,

643
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:43,930
you know, three derivatives
in, um, you know,

644
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:48,640
the such as volatility curve
but the curve of the curve and,

645
00:39:48,641 --> 00:39:51,890
um, you know, as soon as I started
grasping this and going deeper,

646
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:56,080
deeper down that rabbit hole, the more,
the more I liked it as, as a puzzle.

647
00:39:56,110 --> 00:40:00,550
It wasn't certainly the money
had an appeal, but it was also,

648
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,030
hey, here's this, this giant competition.

649
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:08,680
It's like paying a huge multifaceted
chess game that no one's going to get.

650
00:40:08,681 --> 00:40:10,990
Exactly right.
But like I said earlier,

651
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:14,170
it's about making hundreds
of decisions a day.

652
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:18,400
And even when you get 10 in a row
that come up, tails, you know,

653
00:40:18,401 --> 00:40:22,240
that the next one's 50,
50, you know, and uh,

654
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,390
that discipline was interesting.

655
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:31,080
That was more about teaching yourself
the psychology of standing there while

656
00:40:31,241 --> 00:40:36,241
everyone told you you were wrong or you
were like physically small or you are

657
00:40:37,031 --> 00:40:40,510
too educated or too serious.
I mean,

658
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:43,420
you can't imagine how much of a
fraternity house that place was.

659
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:47,350
I everything in Wolf of Wall Street,
I've seen,

660
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:53,320
I haven't lived, but I've seen
it all. Yeah. And, um, you know,

661
00:40:53,321 --> 00:40:57,470
I started hiring very shortly
after I started trading.

662
00:40:57,471 --> 00:41:00,610
And about a year later I left and started
my own company with almost nothing.

663
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:05,980
And I hired my first employee who became
my business partner for the last 25

664
00:41:05,981 --> 00:41:09,760
years.
And I taught him what I,

665
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:14,290
what I learned and I hired people
that I considered corporate refugees,

666
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:15,280
um,

667
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:20,280
people who worked for companies and
decided that independence was better.

668
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,410
Why did you leave after
a year? Um, you know, he,

669
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:31,560
he was moving over to the Chicago Board
of trade and I had found a couple of

670
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:36,380
awesome programmers, um, to help
build this options analysis software.

671
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:39,830
And he sort of offered me up,
um,

672
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:44,060
to run like some of the operations at
the Mercantile Exchange when he went over

673
00:41:44,061 --> 00:41:48,950
to trade the bonds at the board of trade.
And, you know, I mean, he was really,

674
00:41:48,951 --> 00:41:50,250
really smart guy and he,

675
00:41:50,251 --> 00:41:53,810
he made me a deal that when
you analyzed it very carefully,

676
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:58,400
you got worse over time. And I just
kind of went, you know, I like,

677
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:02,660
it's been great and I've learned a ton
and we've made each other a bunch of

678
00:42:02,661 --> 00:42:06,230
money and it's a win win.
But I really wanted to do my own thing.

679
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,920
Like I want it to be the captain
of my own ship I guess. And uh,

680
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:14,290
thankfully this Guy Jim Hansen who is
still one of my dearest friends, um,

681
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:16,250
sort of had an option to,

682
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:21,390
to stay with that company or come at
it completely underfunded company.

683
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,810
I mean, thinking back, it was so stupid,
you know, um, from a risk perspective.

684
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:30,110
But um, it was asymmetric, you know,

685
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:33,020
I'm far more upside than downside and uh,

686
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:37,420
it worked out really well and we spent
most of our time as we hired people and

687
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:39,860
taught them how to do this.

688
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:44,210
It was mostly like psychology training.

689
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:49,600
It was mostly standing around after hours
and saying what's seven times 28 and

690
00:42:51,261 --> 00:42:56,090
screaming at each other like
a drill sergeant until the
person couldn't remember

691
00:42:56,091 --> 00:42:59,460
what nine times three was anymore.
And wait,

692
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:02,390
why didn't you do that
while you had to be quick?

693
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:04,610
You have to be quick on
basic mental agility.

694
00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:09,050
If you bought 450 contracts
and it was a 20 delta,

695
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:13,160
you needed to be able to do
what's 20% of four 50. It's 90,

696
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:17,780
but you need to do that precisely
with numbers that are not so round.

697
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:18,620
Right.
Uh,

698
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:21,770
you need to be willing to not be perfect
and you need to make that decision

699
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:26,690
instantaneously and realizing that it
could cost you 50 to a hundred thousand

700
00:43:26,691 --> 00:43:30,440
dollars if you get it right or wrong
and you, and you have to be really,

701
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:32,180
really comfortable with that.
Um,

702
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:35,570
and so what did we do while
we stood around and we'd be,

703
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:38,570
we turned people's brains
into mush until like,

704
00:43:38,571 --> 00:43:42,710
literally I've had people punch
me, cry, run out. It was, um,

705
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,410
it was, no, I mean, it
sounds awful, but it was,

706
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:49,580
it's amazing training because the
rest of the world moves much slower.

707
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:54,180
So any other decisions that I've
made in business since then, um,

708
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:58,710
have felt glacial in pace. Yeah. Um,

709
00:43:58,770 --> 00:43:59,570
and also

710
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:04,570
something to be said for
making the trainer the training
in some or all respects

711
00:44:04,761 --> 00:44:06,650
harder than the
competition. Right? I mean,

712
00:44:06,651 --> 00:44:10,180
the adage of the more you
sweat during peace time,

713
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:12,200
the less you bleed during
war time. I mean, the,

714
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:16,820
the best competitors I've met in many,

715
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:21,821
many fields often strive to make
their training and the toil of their

716
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:27,700
preparation harder than what they
expect to face when they actually,

717
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:32,220
that's why we love watching big time
sports. Like when it, when it matters,

718
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:35,100
there are certain people
that you know, are, are,

719
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,630
you can almost look at them and go,
ah,

720
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:41,550
at port that port person's gonna fade
and then you, you hope they don't. Right.

721
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:46,170
You hope all that training, you know,
pays off. Um, when you see someone,

722
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:49,200
I love golf for all the same
reasons. It's like, you know, just a,

723
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:53,360
a series of constant
failures. And then, so, um,

724
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:58,500
when you look at someone who, who can
pull that rabbit out of the hat, you know,

725
00:44:58,501 --> 00:45:02,520
at the exactly the right
moment, um, it's, it's pretty,

726
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:06,300
pretty wonderful to see. And, and I, the
thing I loved about my time down there,

727
00:45:06,301 --> 00:45:10,830
even though I burned out of it
after 10 years, is that I, uh,

728
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:14,070
there were moments where I did
absolutely, I mean, I have friends,

729
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:16,880
they'll listen to this and
they'll be like, oh yeah, I
remember that time, the Sop,

730
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:19,960
but you really get this
right. And, um, but I,

731
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:23,550
I made some completely
stupid decisions. Um, but,

732
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:28,470
but mostly on the measure,
um, when things got crazy,

733
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:31,250
I was able to perform more than not.

734
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:35,700
I remember like Greenspan's irrational
exuberance speech was like a formative

735
00:45:35,701 --> 00:45:38,490
moment where I kind of went
like, wow, I can actually,

736
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:43,740
I can not only hang in this environment,
I can thrive in it. And, you know,

737
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:47,610
you get home soaking wet with sweat.
It was a physical job like as a people,

738
00:45:47,611 --> 00:45:51,750
it was really blue collar and
a lot of ways and um, you know,

739
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:55,080
it's like I got home that
day and I was like, that was,

740
00:45:55,081 --> 00:45:59,640
that was what I prep my last six
years for. It was very satisfying.

741
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:03,450
It sounds like an awful, it is an awful
thing in a way. Right. Like, it's,

742
00:46:03,451 --> 00:46:06,450
it's just about pure commerce. Um, it, it,

743
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:10,050
it serves a purpose of price
discovery and all of that.

744
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:13,410
But any individual person isn't
really the one doing that, you know?

745
00:46:13,411 --> 00:46:17,970
So I think that there are negatives to
the whole system as well in hindsight.

746
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:20,970
But man, at the time it just
felt like great mental training.

747
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:26,040
What would you recommend to people
who are listening and are having this

748
00:46:26,041 --> 00:46:31,041
flashback to the introductory
text exchange about beating
the market over a long

749
00:46:31,771 --> 00:46:36,771
period of time who are hoping
to become better investors?

750
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,120
And you can take that anywhere you want,

751
00:46:39,121 --> 00:46:43,560
but are there any particular
tools through mental models?

752
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,400
Anything that you would recommend?
Really, really hard. Um,

753
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,600
I think the mental model
is asymmetric risk.

754
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:52,860
I always look for something that
the, the upside is, you know,

755
00:46:52,861 --> 00:46:55,360
three to four x the downside.
Um,

756
00:46:55,410 --> 00:47:00,300
obviously quantifying those is very
difficult. Um, but that's, that's the key.

757
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:02,970
Everything I tried to do is asymmetric.
Um,

758
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:08,030
and then even though I'm Nesson Taleb
is a bit of a pen Dantic goofball on

759
00:47:09,331 --> 00:47:13,290
Twitter, um, his book fooled
by randomness is awesome. Yeah.

760
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:17,700
That was the one that proceeded Black
Swan. And, um, I think black swans great.

761
00:47:17,701 --> 00:47:20,700
It's fine. But, um,
fooled by randomness is,

762
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:25,020
is I think the better of all his
books because it, it just, man,

763
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:28,890
it just encapsulates everything that
people price things incorrectly.

764
00:47:29,210 --> 00:47:31,750
It's have to casino. Yeah. Yeah.

765
00:47:31,751 --> 00:47:35,580
You Walk through a casino and you see
everybody pricing their outcomes and

766
00:47:35,581 --> 00:47:40,210
correctly the entire city is
built on that. And um, you know,

767
00:47:40,211 --> 00:47:44,080
if you could get in your head,
literally, literally, yeah. Literally.

768
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:47,800
And I don't take any pleasure. Like
people are like, oh, you must do,

769
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:49,360
you must love gambling or whatever.

770
00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:53,230
And it's like I would never sit down to
a blackjack table because I know that,

771
00:47:53,231 --> 00:47:53,471
you know,

772
00:47:53,471 --> 00:47:56,800
there's a 49 and a half percent chance
that I'm going to win and that's the

773
00:47:56,801 --> 00:48:00,600
wrong way. Yeah. Yeah.

774
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:04,840
The fuller randomness is, uh,
has come up a number of times.

775
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:09,440
I haven't read it in ages because it
is one of his earlier books, but, uh,

776
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:09,641
you know,

777
00:48:09,641 --> 00:48:13,000
Howard marks also brought this up
recently when I was chatting with him and,

778
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:17,290
uh,
it is an exceptional book.

779
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:20,560
I think for developing a new lens on life,

780
00:48:20,561 --> 00:48:25,330
not just investing when you
are investing for yourself now,

781
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:29,650
how do you think about,
how do you think about risk,

782
00:48:29,651 --> 00:48:34,180
because this is a word that has popped
up a few times, uh, but a lot of,

783
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:36,620
uh,
how do you proceed?

784
00:48:36,621 --> 00:48:41,320
How do you personally think
about risk in your life? Do you,

785
00:48:41,321 --> 00:48:41,891
for instance,

786
00:48:41,891 --> 00:48:46,891
like some startup founders look at the
risk as the various early stage startups,

787
00:48:47,561 --> 00:48:48,371
restaurants,
bars,

788
00:48:48,371 --> 00:48:53,260
and so on that you're involved with and
then you play it safe in your other kind

789
00:48:53,261 --> 00:48:56,220
of asset allocation.
How do you think about risk in,

790
00:48:56,420 --> 00:49:00,510
in your life or in investing?
Yeah,

791
00:49:00,610 --> 00:49:05,350
it's pretty difficult question.
Yeah, I think that, um,

792
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:09,760
if you look at everything
that I've done business wise,

793
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:15,570
everybody would say that the failure
rate is super high in what we do.

794
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:21,580
So trading these to say one out of a
hundred people that goes down there at

795
00:49:21,581 --> 00:49:24,280
breaks,
even their first year and fewer out of,

796
00:49:24,370 --> 00:49:29,370
out of that one take another hundred
of those ones and less than one in a

797
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:32,500
hundred of those becomes a
millionaire. And I went, great.

798
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:37,290
It's like the old Jim Carrey. So you're
saying there's chance, you know? Right.

799
00:49:37,590 --> 00:49:41,160
You know, and, and uh,

800
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:45,400
and then you go to, uh, to the
restaurant business and people, oh yeah.

801
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:48,070
95% of all the restaurants go out of
business and their first two years,

802
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:53,080
and I'm like, going great. You know,
that's, that's perfect. Um, why do you,

803
00:49:53,081 --> 00:49:57,220
why do you have that response?
Is it because then I'm going to start,

804
00:49:57,221 --> 00:49:59,440
I'm doing a software startup now.
Go for it.

805
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:03,220
So the higher the smaller the hoop,

806
00:50:04,390 --> 00:50:08,620
um, the more interesting
it is to figure it out.

807
00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:10,383
Um,

808
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:15,160
and once you're up there and you know
how to jump up through that little hoop,

809
00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:19,420
um, there's, there's fewer people
playing that game, you know?

810
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:21,550
And,
and the other thing is,

811
00:50:21,551 --> 00:50:25,330
I remember right when I was going to
start building Alinea with, with grant,

812
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:27,440
I was talking to a restaurant owner.

813
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:32,120
And by all accounts he was
pretty successful. He had
four or five restaurants,

814
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,190
and one of them I really liked a lot.

815
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:37,700
And we'd go there a lot and I kinda got
to know him a little bit. And he said,

816
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:38,930
so you know, what are
you up to? And I said,

817
00:50:38,931 --> 00:50:42,170
well actually I'm building a restaurant
now. And he looked at me, said, ah,

818
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:46,670
it's a terrible business. You don't want
to do it, like incredible failure rate.

819
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:49,870
Terrible. And I was like, why
did you build the next four?

820
00:50:53,590 --> 00:50:56,930
What did you, how did you respond
to that? You know, no one does.

821
00:50:56,990 --> 00:50:58,970
That's kind of like, you know,
we'll get to it, I'm sure.

822
00:50:58,971 --> 00:51:02,810
But that's like the way I was with the
publishing thing. It's like, it's like,

823
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:03,411
hey man,

824
00:51:03,411 --> 00:51:07,610
people keep printing books and yet I
can't figure out any of the information.

825
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:10,280
And yet they're going to give me like
three or $400,000 to write a book.

826
00:51:10,550 --> 00:51:14,570
Like somethings remiss here.
Like, you know what I mean?

827
00:51:14,870 --> 00:51:16,160
I've never written a book before,

828
00:51:16,161 --> 00:51:19,310
but yet someone's going to pay me $400,000
check is there must be a lot of money

829
00:51:19,311 --> 00:51:23,930
on the other side of that bet.
And, um, and so consequently you,

830
00:51:23,931 --> 00:51:27,890
like I always try to look for the high
small hoops and then I spend my time

831
00:51:27,891 --> 00:51:30,200
learning as much as I can and
then I jump through that hoop.

832
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,080
It's both more interesting I think.

833
00:51:33,110 --> 00:51:36,780
And I also think getting back
to the asymmetry of risk, um,

834
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:41,090
those are the ones that, you know,
yeah, you might have a, you know,

835
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:41,721
well first of all,

836
00:51:41,721 --> 00:51:45,580
do you really have a 95% failure rate
if you put in all that effort? Yeah,

837
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:50,240
I don't think so. You know? Um,
and second of all, you know,

838
00:51:50,241 --> 00:51:55,100
so I think they priced it wrong so to
speak. Um, and then second of all, like,

839
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,290
man, that's, that's where the fun is.

840
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:00,140
Like that gets you up in the
morning and going to work.

841
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:04,980
Yeah. Yeah. This is, this
is where, uh, in among many,

842
00:52:04,981 --> 00:52:09,600
many other places, averages
can be very, very misleading.

843
00:52:09,870 --> 00:52:11,370
Right. And, uh,

844
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:16,740
I always end up in public Q and
A's and things of this type,

845
00:52:17,611 --> 00:52:21,750
hearing various numbers
and stats thrown around,

846
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:26,130
many of which I think have no basis on
any data whatsoever. But there's the,

847
00:52:26,131 --> 00:52:28,050
we only use 10% of our brands,
not true.

848
00:52:28,350 --> 00:52:33,000
There is the nine out of 10 startups fail
within the first year or whatever the

849
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:34,920
stat is stat is.

850
00:52:34,921 --> 00:52:39,921
And the first question that occurs
to me with a number like the,

851
00:52:41,161 --> 00:52:44,370
uh, the ladder or I
guess a ratio is, well,

852
00:52:44,371 --> 00:52:46,980
is it because the model is difficult?

853
00:52:46,981 --> 00:52:51,981
Is it because startups are
inherently that high risk or is it,

854
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:55,710
is,
are there other plausible explanations?

855
00:52:55,711 --> 00:53:00,420
Is it that nine out of 10 people who
attempt to start a startup don't do any of

856
00:53:00,421 --> 00:53:02,130
the necessary due diligence?
Correct.

857
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:07,300
Yeah. I mean the number of the number of,
I, you know, I've been on a couple of, uh,

858
00:53:07,570 --> 00:53:10,960
like graduate school, you
know, entrepreneurship, um,

859
00:53:11,350 --> 00:53:14,290
like you know,
contests and whatnot.

860
00:53:14,830 --> 00:53:17,470
And one of the things that always
happens there is what I call,

861
00:53:17,471 --> 00:53:21,190
like the time machine. Someone comes
up with a business plan that is like,

862
00:53:21,191 --> 00:53:23,530
you know, you know, I'm going
to build a time machine.

863
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:26,580
Now of course it's not really a time
machine, but I have seen ones at defy,

864
00:53:26,581 --> 00:53:30,240
the laws of physics for
example. Um, or, you know,

865
00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:33,870
new pipeline technology, but they have
no idea. Like it's just a pipe dream.

866
00:53:33,871 --> 00:53:37,440
They've done none of the
engineering, you know. Um, so you,

867
00:53:37,441 --> 00:53:40,590
you kind of look at that and you go,
you know,

868
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:44,640
you haven't really done the
homework yet at all. Um,

869
00:53:44,730 --> 00:53:47,730
and then there's a lot of people that
come to me and they've spent like six

870
00:53:47,731 --> 00:53:52,170
months doing their logo and
the name of the company,

871
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:55,130
but they don't actually have a
piece of software yet. Right.

872
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:58,640
I'm just going to hire someone to
build that for me or I'm an APP. Uh,

873
00:53:58,670 --> 00:54:02,790
y'all get so many apps
pitch to me and you know,

874
00:54:02,791 --> 00:54:06,000
they don't know how to build an APP,
but they've got a logo in an idea.

875
00:54:06,390 --> 00:54:09,600
And I was like, that's a good way to blow
a half million dollars in a consultant.

876
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:17,690
Oh Man, I, we're going to get
all that. You must get that
50 times worse than I. Uh,

877
00:54:17,790 --> 00:54:19,620
I need to,
what I tend to get,

878
00:54:19,621 --> 00:54:22,800
and this is part of the reason why
I stopped all the startup stuff, uh,

879
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:24,300
a couple of years ago,

880
00:54:24,330 --> 00:54:29,070
is it got to the point where
90% of the pitches I received,

881
00:54:29,071 --> 00:54:33,240
which were unsolicited
would be along the lines of,

882
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:38,760
uh, hi comma, like not even a
first name or it'd be like, Hi Tim,

883
00:54:38,761 --> 00:54:41,340
or hate him even better.
Uh,

884
00:54:42,430 --> 00:54:47,400
I am the CEO or cofounder of X. Uh,
we are raising this at this valuation.

885
00:54:47,401 --> 00:54:48,630
We are oversubscribed,

886
00:54:48,631 --> 00:54:52,500
but we could squeeze you in and for 25
k if you're really interested because we

887
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:56,310
admire of ABC, uh,
here, the docs attached,

888
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:59,580
let us know if your interest
in the next 60 minutes,

889
00:55:00,090 --> 00:55:03,780
which I ended up my default response
to anything like that where people are

890
00:55:03,781 --> 00:55:08,760
pressuring me for a fast decision is
no. Like, it's just a, it's like I've,

891
00:55:08,761 --> 00:55:13,470
I've lost very little money saying
no to those things. Um, but the,

892
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:16,300
the goal coming back to the,

893
00:55:16,301 --> 00:55:19,860
the examples that you were giving
and what we were talking about, uh,

894
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:24,810
bridging over to restaurants and food.
Um,

895
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:29,220
so you're, you're being told how
restaurants are an awful business.

896
00:55:29,221 --> 00:55:32,670
Food is an awful business. And I remember
someone told me long, long time ago,

897
00:55:32,671 --> 00:55:37,110
they were like, Yep, if you want to lose
money, go into magazines or restaurants.

898
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:41,100
Right.
And at what point,

899
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:45,030
and I have a little bit of the backstory,
but not all the details,

900
00:55:45,031 --> 00:55:49,980
like at what point do you decide to go
into or get involved with restaurants and

901
00:55:49,981 --> 00:55:50,814
why?

902
00:55:51,830 --> 00:55:56,630
Well, so I, I left trading
in about 2002, um, 2001,

903
00:55:56,700 --> 00:56:00,530
uh,
knew it was a tough year between nine 11,

904
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:06,170
which was my father had died in February
of that year. Um, I was burnt out after,

905
00:56:06,171 --> 00:56:09,800
you know, going really hard
for so long and um, you know,

906
00:56:09,801 --> 00:56:12,170
we'd built up a pretty
good size company too.

907
00:56:12,171 --> 00:56:14,780
And I merged with a firm
in New York and I just,

908
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:17,150
I kind of needed a break
but didn't know how to,

909
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:20,660
how to really take one at
the time. Um, and so I left,

910
00:56:20,690 --> 00:56:24,060
I left trading and I immediately
kind panicked because here's

911
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:28,000
something that I,
I really genuinely enjoyed but didn't,

912
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:33,300
didn't kind of know what I wanted to do
next and started doing consulting for a

913
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:37,630
small hedge fund and, and then, you know,

914
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:40,320
I just didn't know what to
do. And I, I had, you know,

915
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:44,020
an awesome wife and a young son
and things were good, you know,

916
00:56:44,021 --> 00:56:48,370
but I was kind of panicked. I was, I
was playing golf with like, you know,

917
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:52,480
ex athletes because who else is 34 years
old and complete golf on a Wednesday

918
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:53,620
afternoon.
Um,

919
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:57,760
and so it was just a weird thing and I
kind of looked at them and I'm like, oh,

920
00:56:57,761 --> 00:56:59,610
they don't really seem all that happy,
even though they're,

921
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:03,520
they've got this lifestyle. And so, um,

922
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:08,290
I met grant Achatz, um, the
chef, uh, at dwell dining,

923
00:57:08,291 --> 00:57:09,124
a trio,
um,

924
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:14,160
went to a lunch there one afternoon
that some friends set up and it was a

925
00:57:15,191 --> 00:57:19,240
transformative experience. It was
artistic, it was intellectual,

926
00:57:19,241 --> 00:57:20,770
it was thought provoking.
Most of all,

927
00:57:20,771 --> 00:57:25,771
it was emotional and those are all
things that I would never have associated

928
00:57:26,141 --> 00:57:30,310
with eating at dinner.
Right. Um, and so from,

929
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:33,790
from a perspective of like
great art experiences,

930
00:57:33,791 --> 00:57:38,260
like seeing a great movie or a great play
or going to an amazing museum opening,

931
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:42,190
um,
we kept getting drawing back there,

932
00:57:42,370 --> 00:57:46,450
like we kept going back and we would go
back so frequently that it was absurd

933
00:57:46,451 --> 00:57:49,360
because, you know, as a big
meal and it wasn't cheap.

934
00:57:49,570 --> 00:57:52,840
And every time we'd go somewhere
else, we'd go like, wow, why are,

935
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:57,220
why is no one else thinking this way?
And as I got to know grants a little bit,

936
00:57:57,221 --> 00:58:00,400
I think like sometimes
people bring, um, you know,

937
00:58:00,401 --> 00:58:02,770
the chefs and wine or beer or whatever,
and it's like,

938
00:58:02,771 --> 00:58:05,650
that's kind of sand to the
beach. You know, I would,

939
00:58:06,430 --> 00:58:09,880
I would bring him books and I didn't
figure he had a lot of time to read.

940
00:58:10,330 --> 00:58:14,200
So I would put like a post it
note on a page of an old book.

941
00:58:14,201 --> 00:58:17,710
So I remember I brought him this book
called the peregrinations of an epicure.

942
00:58:18,130 --> 00:58:21,490
Hold on. It's like the peregrinations,
like a Peregrine Falcon.

943
00:58:21,491 --> 00:58:26,080
I don't even know what that
paragraph nation is like a
wondering about. Uh, okay.

944
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:30,370
So it was written just after World
War Two, um, by an ex servicemen. Um,

945
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:34,090
and he, he kind of goes
around, um, you know, Paris,

946
00:58:34,091 --> 00:58:38,710
I want to say maybe late forties, early
fifties. I can't recall exactly. And,

947
00:58:38,711 --> 00:58:42,170
uh, there was, um, a chapter in
there, unloved pair Meade, uh,

948
00:58:42,190 --> 00:58:46,450
which was a very classical restaurant,
kind of the best in the world at the time.

949
00:58:46,810 --> 00:58:51,810
And he described to me a meal there in
emotional terms that resonated with what

950
00:58:52,781 --> 00:58:55,780
grant was doing, even though
his technique, his cuisine,

951
00:58:55,781 --> 00:58:57,040
everything was completely different.

952
00:58:57,670 --> 00:59:02,620
And so I literally just highlight like a
couple lines in there and give him this

953
00:59:02,621 --> 00:59:05,990
book, which was out of
print at the time. And, um,

954
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:11,700
we kind of developed this
email relationship back and
forth where he would sort

955
00:59:11,771 --> 00:59:16,390
of try out some new food down
us. And, um, I would give,

956
00:59:17,230 --> 00:59:21,220
you know, direct, honest feedback,
but not like, oh, it was delicious.

957
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:24,140
It was more or less, it was
more like the, you know,

958
00:59:24,290 --> 00:59:27,770
like you're going for a provocation
there, but if you, you know,

959
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:31,310
and we would go back and forth
and he wrote a, at the time on a,

960
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:33,980
on a forum called Eagle it.
Uh,

961
00:59:33,981 --> 00:59:37,490
and I went down there and his spelling
and grammar, not with standing.

962
00:59:37,610 --> 00:59:41,870
I mean it was like reading someone who's
just really thinking hard about what

963
00:59:41,871 --> 00:59:42,321
they were doing.

964
00:59:42,321 --> 00:59:45,860
Everything we just talked about here
was this young 28 year old chef from

965
00:59:45,861 --> 00:59:50,450
Michigan who looked like captain America
who would come out, not, you know,

966
00:59:50,451 --> 00:59:52,640
he was like how you would
in the sense of like,

967
00:59:52,670 --> 00:59:56,600
he was good looking and very driven,
very clean cut, but he didn't look like,

968
00:59:56,830 --> 01:00:00,530
you know, the stereotype central casting
of a chef. Right. You know, Chubby,

969
01:00:00,531 --> 01:00:03,320
gregarious guy. He was really
quiet and introspective, shy.

970
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:07,210
But then you read and you know these
which are still up, you know, I,

971
01:00:07,211 --> 01:00:09,860
you can still Google it and you'd go like,
you know,

972
01:00:09,890 --> 01:00:12,230
he'd go on for like four
pages about bread service.

973
01:00:12,850 --> 01:00:14,330
Like what's the point of bread?
You know,

974
01:00:14,630 --> 01:00:18,750
and this is the kind that I could
wrap my head around. And so, um,

975
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:23,140
I remember on January 20th, 2004, uh,

976
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:27,140
it's my wife's birthday and she
said, yeah, I want to go back there.

977
01:00:27,141 --> 01:00:30,230
And we'd never been in the kitchen
before and they have a table there,

978
01:00:30,231 --> 01:00:34,180
but we never eaten in there. And, um,

979
01:00:34,370 --> 01:00:38,420
I remember I emailed him and said,
she's ethnically Latvian,

980
01:00:38,421 --> 01:00:41,630
speaks Japanese and loves Thai food.
Good fucking luck.

981
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:48,590
And I knew exactly what that would do
to them that would put into 10 days of

982
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:53,620
pure hell because he human
research Latvian food,

983
01:00:54,590 --> 01:00:58,070
he would have to read, like he would
redo a whole menu, 20 courses. Right.

984
01:00:58,550 --> 01:01:01,450
And I didn't know they were going
to put us in the kitchen. And, um,

985
01:01:01,570 --> 01:01:04,940
they put us in the kitchen. I mean, it
sounds like a jerky thing to do now,

986
01:01:04,970 --> 01:01:09,970
but we did have a relationship a little
bit at the time and he served us like

987
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:14,600
the most amazing meal of
my life, you know. Um,

988
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:18,130
and it started out with Latvians
sorrel soup with braised ham hocks,

989
01:01:19,010 --> 01:01:22,930
and, you know, it had flavors of the
sea, which was a Japanese dish. It had,

990
01:01:22,990 --> 01:01:26,000
it had Thai dishes, it, but
it was all in his style.

991
01:01:26,690 --> 01:01:30,200
And so it was his own, and yet it
had elements of all these things.

992
01:01:30,470 --> 01:01:35,330
And at the end of that meal, um, he said
to me, you know, well, what do you think?

993
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:38,360
And I'd watched the kitchen and
it was like a watchmaker shop.

994
01:01:38,990 --> 01:01:43,910
It was not screaming and yelling.
It is, it is just as it is.

995
01:01:43,911 --> 01:01:48,911
So unlike anything that the vast majority
of people listening to this would

996
01:01:49,461 --> 01:01:54,160
possibly expect, right. Ramsay
Gordon Ramsay, right? Yeah.

997
01:01:54,230 --> 01:01:58,850
It is just complete silence. It is
like a watchmaking factory. It is.

998
01:01:58,851 --> 01:02:03,290
Uh, it is really something
else. Anyway, I started to jump
in. Yeah, no, no, no. It's,

999
01:02:03,291 --> 01:02:06,410
it's, that's, that's totally fine.
And so at the end I said, you know,

1000
01:02:06,411 --> 01:02:10,490
I doubt anybody anywhere in the world had
a better meal tonight. And he was like,

1001
01:02:10,491 --> 01:02:13,760
well, well, thank you. And I said, what
are you planning on doing with yourself?

1002
01:02:13,761 --> 01:02:15,460
You know, I mean, I was like kind of,

1003
01:02:15,470 --> 01:02:18,800
I had a lot of wine and I kind
of looked at him, you know,

1004
01:02:18,801 --> 01:02:22,470
he down with us and I said, what do you,
what are you going to do? And he goes,

1005
01:02:22,471 --> 01:02:25,050
well, what do you mean? I said, well,
you're not going to be here forever.

1006
01:02:25,650 --> 01:02:29,820
And he said, well, I want to build
my own restaurant. I said, I'd be,

1007
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:32,520
I'd be happy to help you
do that. And he said, well,

1008
01:02:32,521 --> 01:02:34,350
what kind of restaurant do you want
to build? I said, I don't know.

1009
01:02:34,351 --> 01:02:37,500
I've never built a restaurant before.
That was it.

1010
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:40,380
And then like a week later I got an email
with his business plan and I invited

1011
01:02:40,381 --> 01:02:45,270
him by my house in a year to the day
later of that. That was May 4th. Um,

1012
01:02:45,450 --> 01:02:48,190
you know, I, we went back and
forth on email on May 4th,

1013
01:02:48,810 --> 01:02:52,320
we held a dinner at my house
for potential investors.

1014
01:02:52,830 --> 01:02:54,210
And on May 4th,
2005,

1015
01:02:54,211 --> 01:02:59,211
we opened Alinea is nuts in
terms of each other that,

1016
01:03:00,270 --> 01:03:01,800
can you put that in
perspective for people?

1017
01:03:01,801 --> 01:03:06,060
I actually did not realize that was the,
the timeframe.

1018
01:03:06,630 --> 01:03:11,160
Yeah. I mean, can you just in the
context of like normal restaurant world,

1019
01:03:11,430 --> 01:03:15,030
we argued like, so we didn't
really know each other very well,

1020
01:03:15,570 --> 01:03:19,320
but he would come by my house and he,
and he didn't let, let me, let me,

1021
01:03:19,350 --> 01:03:20,820
let me interject for a
second because you've,

1022
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,860
you've said we didn't
know each other very well.

1023
01:03:22,890 --> 01:03:27,890
What did you know about each other
nonetheless that gave you guys the,

1024
01:03:29,130 --> 01:03:32,370
like the push,
like the impulse and the,

1025
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:38,320
the sufficient level of trust slash
excitement to actually pursue it.

1026
01:03:39,181 --> 01:03:42,210
Right. There had to be something
there. It couldn't just be nothing.

1027
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:45,130
So what was it, you didn't
know each other? Well, I mean,

1028
01:03:45,131 --> 01:03:48,180
you maybe you didn't know the full scope
of each other's back thoughts. Yeah,

1029
01:03:48,181 --> 01:03:51,780
I mean, I actually studied that like,
that I actually knew I knew the facts,

1030
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:55,080
you know, um, and I knew what he
was putting in front of me. Um,

1031
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:58,170
but I didn't know him,
you know,

1032
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:00,570
like the way you know someone that
you're going to become a business partner

1033
01:04:00,571 --> 01:04:04,980
with. Um, and I think he
just thought I was rich.

1034
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:09,303
I'd be curious

1035
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:14,370
like I think everyone else wanted this is,

1036
01:04:14,371 --> 01:04:16,840
this is really true cause
he has said this to me. Um,

1037
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:20,410
everyone else wanted to offer him a,

1038
01:04:21,030 --> 01:04:25,410
a restaurant that they had
already built or wanted to build.

1039
01:04:25,770 --> 01:04:28,260
And I actually answered that
question correctly. The,

1040
01:04:28,261 --> 01:04:32,190
I don't know is an awesome thing to say,
like 90% of the time for your life.

1041
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:36,450
Right. And so when he said, what can
a restaurant do you want to build?

1042
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:40,380
I could have waxed on about some dream
I had or just made some bullshit up at

1043
01:04:40,381 --> 01:04:44,010
the time. But I just said like, I have
no idea. Like we, that's a big question.

1044
01:04:44,011 --> 01:04:47,250
We need to sort that out. Um, and I
think that was the right answer for him.

1045
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:50,010
I think that's all he needed
to know. It was like, okay,

1046
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:54,300
the guy's got an open mind. He seems to
have done well in business. He knows like,

1047
01:04:54,330 --> 01:04:56,500
you know, apparently how
to build something. Well,

1048
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:59,190
it was really funny is that the
stuff that I was concerned about,

1049
01:04:59,191 --> 01:05:04,080
which was like architecture, design,
plumbing, you know, building,

1050
01:05:04,110 --> 01:05:06,870
lease, all of that. He was like,

1051
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:11,970
the word oblivious is not too strong
of a word. Um, like, you know,

1052
01:05:12,390 --> 01:05:14,330
this is not a criticism of him either,
right?

1053
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:17,140
It's just like he came to my house and
he was just like, yeah, I, you know,

1054
01:05:17,141 --> 01:05:21,010
I want Martin to design everything. And
Martin Kastner, who is a genius designer,

1055
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:25,250
has crucial detail, which we've been
involved with for 15 years now. Um,

1056
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:29,440
he's a, like a designer. He's
like, uh, uh, an artisan,

1057
01:05:29,470 --> 01:05:32,170
like he built plateware and
he wanted the book who's to,

1058
01:05:32,180 --> 01:05:34,720
or for the platter he
designed for Thomas Keller,

1059
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:39,190
Daniel Boulud's team for the team USA
and all that. Now, but back then, like,

1060
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:41,410
I mean, this guy's not gonna
design plumbing or electrical.

1061
01:05:41,620 --> 01:05:43,870
So I would just look at them
going like, well, no, he can't.

1062
01:05:43,970 --> 01:05:45,660
We need an architect and you need to get,
you know,

1063
01:05:45,661 --> 01:05:49,900
like city stamps and all that and all
that. So, um, I think grant was just like,

1064
01:05:49,901 --> 01:05:52,020
yeah, you find a place, you
put tables in it and you know,

1065
01:05:52,090 --> 01:05:55,600
build a kitchen and you go,
um, you know, in terms of like,

1066
01:05:55,630 --> 01:05:57,880
obviously he knew that her
health inspectors and all that,

1067
01:05:57,881 --> 01:06:01,630
but the process of all this just about,
you know,

1068
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:06,970
you either were going to not build it
ever eight weeks in because we would have

1069
01:06:06,971 --> 01:06:11,971
hated each other where we really kind of
people that figured everything out and

1070
01:06:12,850 --> 01:06:16,900
we just talked it out like right
down to like, what kind of tables,

1071
01:06:16,901 --> 01:06:20,020
what kind of glass where, what
kind of this like, you know,

1072
01:06:20,021 --> 01:06:22,660
we wanted to rethink the
why again if everything,

1073
01:06:22,690 --> 01:06:25,960
like why do you put a candle on the table?
Why is it candle romantic?

1074
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:30,580
Like that's a question we asked. Why do
we need candles? That's kind of like,

1075
01:06:30,581 --> 01:06:33,160
why is that romantic? Why is, um,

1076
01:06:33,190 --> 01:06:35,710
why do people put a little
bud vase on the table?

1077
01:06:35,830 --> 01:06:38,970
Why shouldn't that be an edible
thing? That'd be cool. So,

1078
01:06:39,010 --> 01:06:43,330
so we did all of that and we designed
the experience to create emotional

1079
01:06:43,331 --> 01:06:46,030
responses from the moment that
you walked in the front door.

1080
01:06:46,570 --> 01:06:49,960
So we didn't have the podium.
Um, you know, we went,

1081
01:06:49,961 --> 01:06:54,130
what is a good greeting feel
like not just, you know,

1082
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:58,180
if you're at someone's house, what does
that feel like if you're at a restaurant,

1083
01:06:58,181 --> 01:06:59,470
what shouldn't it feel like?
Well,

1084
01:06:59,471 --> 01:07:03,340
it shouldn't feel like a computer in front
of your face saying, what's your name?

1085
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:07,690
You know, and all that. So we, we went
through every aspect of that and no,

1086
01:07:07,710 --> 01:07:12,500
I lost almost 20 pounds that year. Not
in a healthy way. Um, just like, gee,

1087
01:07:12,501 --> 01:07:13,930
seeing the construction,

1088
01:07:14,020 --> 01:07:17,770
I laid tile in the basement like
three days before we open. Let me,

1089
01:07:17,890 --> 01:07:18,970
let me pause for one second.

1090
01:07:19,150 --> 01:07:24,150
So the why question that comes to
mind for me is after the finance,

1091
01:07:24,820 --> 01:07:29,820
after battling it out on the front
lines and going through 2001,

1092
01:07:30,550 --> 01:07:33,850
why this as your next thing? Like, why,

1093
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:38,880
why was this the thing that captured your
imagination as you had to know on some

1094
01:07:39,431 --> 01:07:42,430
level once you started getting into
the details? Like, fuck, I mean,

1095
01:07:42,431 --> 01:07:45,240
this is going to be, yeah, it's
all in. This has to be a big,

1096
01:07:45,241 --> 01:07:49,510
this is going to be all my chips
and energetically. So why, why this,

1097
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:52,630
you know,
there,

1098
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:57,660
there are occasional times when you
wake up in the morning and like,

1099
01:07:57,941 --> 01:08:01,930
that thought comes back to you
that, that like, hey, um, you know,

1100
01:08:02,730 --> 01:08:05,860
I'm, I'm, I'm really sucked
into this. Right. You know,

1101
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:10,480
and for about three or four
months without telling anybody,

1102
01:08:10,510 --> 01:08:14,770
even like, even not telling
her, like, telling no one,

1103
01:08:15,050 --> 01:08:17,420
I kept going like,
I should build a restaurant with this guy.

1104
01:08:18,220 --> 01:08:22,340
Like it would be the best restaurant in
the world if it was done all the way.

1105
01:08:22,490 --> 01:08:23,323
Right.

1106
01:08:23,510 --> 01:08:28,430
And I recognized my inner voice saying,

1107
01:08:28,490 --> 01:08:31,640
that's a really dumb idea. You know,
and you don't know what you're doing.

1108
01:08:31,670 --> 01:08:34,390
I'd never worked a day in my life
and a restaurant. Right. And,

1109
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:37,130
and I also recognized,
and this is also critical,

1110
01:08:37,550 --> 01:08:42,530
I recognized that so many people built
their living room after they made some

1111
01:08:42,531 --> 01:08:44,360
money. So they went like, oh,

1112
01:08:44,361 --> 01:08:48,290
well I know how to host a good
dinner party and I know good wine,

1113
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:49,820
so I'm going to build me a restaurant.

1114
01:08:50,330 --> 01:08:54,680
And then they sit there like it's
their living room. And that's not good.

1115
01:08:54,770 --> 01:08:59,130
Like I didn't want to be that, that
DC guy that built the restaurant, um,

1116
01:08:59,210 --> 01:09:03,920
because my ego was needed to host a party.
Um,

1117
01:09:04,010 --> 01:09:08,690
and so whenever I would kind of lead her
on broach that subject and people would

1118
01:09:08,691 --> 01:09:11,630
say like, well, you know, I can
almost hear their brain whispering,

1119
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:16,250
well of course that's what
he's going to do. And, and,

1120
01:09:16,940 --> 01:09:21,470
and so that was again, not the best
of motivations in the world perhaps,

1121
01:09:21,471 --> 01:09:25,700
but the honest one that was
hugely motivating. Um, eventually,

1122
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:28,970
but when we first started,
it was this nagging thing.

1123
01:09:28,971 --> 01:09:31,880
Like I'd wake up in the morning
and I would go, you know,

1124
01:09:31,881 --> 01:09:33,500
I'm not really into what
I'm doing right now,

1125
01:09:34,010 --> 01:09:37,400
and I've just met somebody
who's the best in the world.

1126
01:09:37,401 --> 01:09:41,480
At what they do and no one knows
it yet. Like, and, and you know,

1127
01:09:41,930 --> 01:09:43,550
it was probably met.
That's probably happened to be,

1128
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:46,070
I'm really fortunate that that's probably
happened to be seven or eight times in

1129
01:09:46,071 --> 01:09:50,570
my life. And when it happens and I
meet that person, whoever it may be,

1130
01:09:50,571 --> 01:09:54,500
no matter what they're
doing, I, I, I pause,

1131
01:09:54,530 --> 01:09:59,120
I kind of acknowledged that directly and
then I just go like, you know, can we,

1132
01:09:59,121 --> 01:10:00,080
can we,
you know,

1133
01:10:00,110 --> 01:10:05,060
grab a glass of wine or coffee or
something and like that's something worth

1134
01:10:05,061 --> 01:10:08,480
marking and going like, wow, this
person's really invested in something.

1135
01:10:08,690 --> 01:10:11,780
And grant had every aspect of being,

1136
01:10:12,410 --> 01:10:16,310
being that at 28 years old.
And, and it, I, you know,

1137
01:10:16,311 --> 01:10:20,390
I mean in hindsight, like it looks,
it looks smart, but I got to tell you,

1138
01:10:20,391 --> 01:10:21,860
it was years before it felt smart

1139
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:27,950
because you mentioned just now that
you've met these people seven or eight

1140
01:10:27,951 --> 01:10:32,000
times, who are the best in the world, uh,

1141
01:10:32,030 --> 01:10:36,380
or potentially the best thing, most
of them among them. But the, the, the,

1142
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:41,060
the key point that jumps
out for me is in the world,

1143
01:10:41,061 --> 01:10:45,610
didn't know it yet.
So my question for you is that,

1144
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:48,440
that sort of brings to the forefront,
in my mind,

1145
01:10:48,441 --> 01:10:53,441
at least the question of what is Nick's
seeing or feeling that other people are

1146
01:10:55,821 --> 01:10:58,430
not. Could you talk to that? And I mean,

1147
01:10:58,970 --> 01:11:02,510
is there a feeling or a
particular type of observation,

1148
01:11:02,511 --> 01:11:06,650
a particular type of detail that you
noticed in these people that allows you to

1149
01:11:06,651 --> 01:11:10,940
scout the talent where other people might
miss it or not pay enough attention to

1150
01:11:10,941 --> 01:11:15,690
it? Yeah, I mean, I think you've
written a couple about, about that.

1151
01:11:16,020 --> 01:11:20,790
Um, it's, it's, it's definitely
intangible. Um, you know,

1152
01:11:20,820 --> 01:11:24,030
it's, I think it's
different in every case. Um,

1153
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:25,890
but it's,

1154
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:30,920
it's interesting because you can
tell when someone is fully committed,

1155
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:36,030
I guess to their craft or their art or
their business or whatever it is that

1156
01:11:36,031 --> 01:11:40,600
they're doing their sport.
Um, and it's not because they,

1157
01:11:40,601 --> 01:11:44,460
they talk it about it all the time
though. Of course, you know, if you,

1158
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:46,440
if you push a little,
they're happy to do so.

1159
01:11:47,010 --> 01:11:50,700
But it's more that like
if you look around,

1160
01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:55,350
like the vast majority of people are not
fully committed to whatever, you know,

1161
01:11:55,890 --> 01:11:59,760
and I think part of what you do is you
try to steer people to find those things

1162
01:11:59,761 --> 01:12:01,710
that,
that they can commit to,

1163
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:04,620
or you can try to lower a
barrier to show them like, hey,

1164
01:12:04,621 --> 01:12:08,130
the commitment's not as hard as you think
in this particular area. Right. Right.

1165
01:12:08,190 --> 01:12:12,210
But these folks are like,
they're all in their 99%,

1166
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:16,040
and that's what they do often
to the detriment, frankly, of,

1167
01:12:16,100 --> 01:12:18,960
of other aspects of their lives.
Um,

1168
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:23,670
and I guess you get better
at noticing them, you know?

1169
01:12:24,270 --> 01:12:29,010
Um, and I mean now, like that's like,

1170
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:33,540
boy, I live for that. Like
I love meeting people that,

1171
01:12:33,990 --> 01:12:34,823
um,

1172
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:40,470
even if it's not something I'm
interested in that are all in, you know,

1173
01:12:40,980 --> 01:12:45,480
and, and that's, that's an
interesting, you know, I really,

1174
01:12:45,481 --> 01:12:47,400
I've never really thought
about it that way, but like,

1175
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:50,990
it was this very clear to me
that grant was all in. Like,
if, here's the thing, if,

1176
01:12:51,050 --> 01:12:55,620
if he wasn't gonna do it with me, he
was still gonna do it. Yeah, I was,

1177
01:12:55,650 --> 01:12:59,460
I was, uh, I was a helper. I, you know,

1178
01:12:59,461 --> 01:13:04,050
over time I certainly contributed,
um, you know, a great deal to it,

1179
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:07,050
not just he contributed a
great deal of the business.

1180
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:10,560
And then I also contributed to the
art, but that took time, you know,

1181
01:13:11,070 --> 01:13:14,490
but I could tell that he was all
in and, and that was fun. I mean,

1182
01:13:14,491 --> 01:13:18,090
it's fun to work with somebody
who is basically like, okay man,

1183
01:13:18,091 --> 01:13:21,300
if you're not in like get out of the way.
Cause I'm still going [inaudible]

1184
01:13:22,450 --> 01:13:27,130
and for anyone who has the opportunity,

1185
01:13:27,131 --> 01:13:30,400
I don't even know if they would
have the opportunity, but to watch,

1186
01:13:31,030 --> 01:13:35,890
observe grant even for 60 seconds.
Well,

1187
01:13:35,891 --> 01:13:39,130
chef's table on Netflix is a
great chef's table. Yeah. Perfect.

1188
01:13:39,131 --> 01:13:44,131
So everybody should have the experience
of observing grant working and focusing.

1189
01:13:46,390 --> 01:13:51,070
It is. I've, I've met a lot of
people who are good at focusing,

1190
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:56,520
who have abnormal focusing abilities and
spending the time that we did together

1191
01:13:57,551 --> 01:14:02,551
in Chicago and the time that
I had to observe grant is,

1192
01:14:03,250 --> 01:14:08,080
it is a next level of focus. It's, it's
really hard to encapsulate and words.

1193
01:14:08,140 --> 01:14:11,020
So chef's table, fantastic people
should check it out. And just

1194
01:14:12,550 --> 01:14:17,550
the level of focus that is
permeates the appearance,

1195
01:14:18,581 --> 01:14:22,830
the air, the atmosphere. It's
really something else. Uh,

1196
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:25,840
so to,
to to to that point focus,

1197
01:14:27,130 --> 01:14:30,880
one of the,
my favorite aspects of,

1198
01:14:31,210 --> 01:14:34,840
of speaking with you and having
conversations is the question,

1199
01:14:34,841 --> 01:14:37,780
the questions that you raised,
right? Like what candle?

1200
01:14:37,781 --> 01:14:40,930
Not just should we have candles?
Like that's maybe a good question,

1201
01:14:40,931 --> 01:14:42,610
but it's probably not
the right first question.

1202
01:14:42,611 --> 01:14:46,660
Like why do restaurants use candles
in the first place? Furthermore,

1203
01:14:46,661 --> 01:14:51,280
wire candles consider romantic, right?
Like kind of stepping basic basic stuff.

1204
01:14:51,310 --> 01:14:51,640
Yeah.

1205
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:56,640
What are other questions that you
asked related to a linea or you,

1206
01:14:56,650 --> 01:15:01,630
he can certainly bridge to two other,
uh, you know, I think it makes sense to,

1207
01:15:01,631 --> 01:15:05,360
to chat about aviary as well. But what
are, what are some other questions that,

1208
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:09,850
that you guys asked
that, uh, people might,

1209
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:10,900
might not think to ask?

1210
01:15:11,210 --> 01:15:15,470
Yeah, I mean, it, you know, grants at the
tone for that. Um, in our first meeting,

1211
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:18,620
not really knowing me
and we started talking,

1212
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:22,490
but we didn't even know
where to start. Right? And he
said, well, I know one thing,

1213
01:15:22,491 --> 01:15:26,120
I want to have wooden tables,
like I want to have bare wood tables.

1214
01:15:26,660 --> 01:15:28,160
And I said, why? He said, well,

1215
01:15:28,161 --> 01:15:31,520
why do tables while your fancy
restaurants have white tablecloths?

1216
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:35,450
They literally call it a white
tablecloth restaurant if it's fancy. Why?

1217
01:15:36,020 --> 01:15:40,030
And I couldn't really, I came
up with dumb answers like, oh,

1218
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:45,040
it feels good or it absorbs like
a spill or whatever it may be. Um,

1219
01:15:45,110 --> 01:15:47,360
and he said, no, it's because of the
table underneath as a piece of shit.

1220
01:15:50,270 --> 01:15:53,420
And he's like, he goes, and you know
that like, as soon as you say it,

1221
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:54,710
everyone goes, oh yeah, I knew that.

1222
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:59,420
And you've been at weddings and stuff
where you feel under the table and you're

1223
01:15:59,421 --> 01:16:02,870
like, oh, it's plywood. Right? But if
you go to like a really fancy restaurant,

1224
01:16:02,871 --> 01:16:06,650
you feel under the table, guess what? Also
applied with just a little thicker. Um,

1225
01:16:06,740 --> 01:16:10,310
and he's like, you know, when
you rest your arms on the table,

1226
01:16:10,490 --> 01:16:12,650
even if it doesn't come
forefront in your mind,

1227
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:16,850
you kind of subconsciously
know that they're kind of
fooling you. And he's like,

1228
01:16:16,940 --> 01:16:20,360
why can't we just have like
black beautiful tables?

1229
01:16:20,361 --> 01:16:23,240
It'll show the food grade,
they'll show the plate where great.

1230
01:16:23,810 --> 01:16:27,540
And then I kind of went like,
well, yeah, but like, you know, um,

1231
01:16:27,650 --> 01:16:30,230
the health department doesn't
let you put in Chicago,

1232
01:16:30,231 --> 01:16:33,320
doesn't let you put silverware right
on the table. And if you put a glass,

1233
01:16:33,321 --> 01:16:35,120
they're the kind of sensational form,
a little ring,

1234
01:16:35,420 --> 01:16:37,760
and then you have a wear issue.
Um,

1235
01:16:37,790 --> 01:16:41,840
but you'll save $70,000 a
year in laundering linens.

1236
01:16:42,260 --> 01:16:45,890
And so we started going like, well, how
did we solve the water problem? Well,

1237
01:16:46,010 --> 01:16:51,010
you create a fridge that's just above
the duty point 44 degrees in the winter,

1238
01:16:51,231 --> 01:16:54,800
maybe a little warmer in the
summer because it's higher
humidity in Chicago and

1239
01:16:54,801 --> 01:16:57,390
you just get rid of ice.
It's, you know, it says,

1240
01:16:57,470 --> 01:17:02,470
so you have these cascading decisions
that like become part of the art of the

1241
01:17:03,861 --> 01:17:08,540
place that some of them start from like
a really practical thing. Like, Hey,

1242
01:17:08,541 --> 01:17:09,920
we want to have a table.

1243
01:17:10,310 --> 01:17:13,520
And then all of a sudden you need a
little pillow that the silverware goes on

1244
01:17:13,850 --> 01:17:17,480
because that Martin designed,
because you can't put,

1245
01:17:17,770 --> 01:17:20,300
we didn't want to have
place mats that's too cheap.

1246
01:17:20,390 --> 01:17:24,590
So all of a sudden we had to design
like, you know, a silverware holder.

1247
01:17:24,980 --> 01:17:29,980
So it just became this cascade of
like interesting little art projects,

1248
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:31,370
um,

1249
01:17:31,370 --> 01:17:36,370
that were there for good reasons and
really created a unique atmosphere.

1250
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:38,240
And it was like one of the things,

1251
01:17:38,241 --> 01:17:41,540
like we never tested it
until the day we opened.

1252
01:17:41,570 --> 01:17:43,010
Like you couldn't test those things.

1253
01:17:43,460 --> 01:17:48,050
And the very first guy through the
door was, um, is now a famous chef,

1254
01:17:48,051 --> 01:17:52,440
chef Sean Brock of husk
plastic. Yeah. So he was,

1255
01:17:52,730 --> 01:17:54,800
he was not yet a chef then 2005,

1256
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:58,790
and he was the first guy through the door
and he wrote this giant blog post and

1257
01:17:58,791 --> 01:18:01,040
eagle it with pictures and everything.
You can go see it.

1258
01:18:01,610 --> 01:18:06,610
And every single thing that we hoped
would create an emotional trigger,

1259
01:18:07,580 --> 01:18:10,970
an emotional reaction, it's
almost at all. They're like,

1260
01:18:10,971 --> 01:18:14,330
I remember going home and seeing that
the next day and going, wow, like,

1261
01:18:14,630 --> 01:18:18,340
that should actually work,
you know,

1262
01:18:18,570 --> 01:18:21,950
and it's like right down to the
front hallway that was, you know,

1263
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:25,550
a reverse perspective and, you know,
stolen from sharp cathedral and,

1264
01:18:25,551 --> 01:18:27,960
and an inverted, you know, um,

1265
01:18:28,010 --> 01:18:33,010
so all of my interests of architecture
and art and science and all of grants,

1266
01:18:33,260 --> 01:18:34,460
you know,
food and all that,

1267
01:18:34,490 --> 01:18:38,930
like all came together in like a year
long conversation on how to do something.

1268
01:18:39,530 --> 01:18:43,730
And we really fought with the architect
and designers and all of that because

1269
01:18:43,731 --> 01:18:47,930
people would tell us the practical
reasons why you needed to do this or that.

1270
01:18:48,110 --> 01:18:51,470
And we would just go, nope,
no host Dan. Like, you know,

1271
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:55,000
we want to greet people
in a, in an open way. Um,

1272
01:18:55,190 --> 01:18:59,640
and so just little things like that. And
then we've taken that on, you know, um,

1273
01:18:59,870 --> 01:19:04,280
through everything that we've,
we've done where we took, you know,

1274
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:06,560
seven years,
six years to,

1275
01:19:06,590 --> 01:19:10,520
to build our next place because we
didn't have that idea that kept us up at

1276
01:19:10,521 --> 01:19:15,050
night again. Um, and so,
you know, when we did,

1277
01:19:15,051 --> 01:19:17,570
then we did it. And I
think, I think editing,

1278
01:19:19,100 --> 01:19:24,080
editing yourself and each other
is in an open way is really,

1279
01:19:24,081 --> 01:19:26,930
really painful, but
really, really important.

1280
01:19:28,070 --> 01:19:33,070
And coming back to something you
mentioned relate to the living room,

1281
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:37,730
uh, the, uh, the well off, uh, yes.

1282
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:43,040
Who then create saying art
project that is not, uh,

1283
01:19:43,090 --> 01:19:47,390
may be beautiful,
but is most often not a viable business.

1284
01:19:48,380 --> 01:19:49,310
What,

1285
01:19:49,820 --> 01:19:54,820
how did you apply those questions and
rethink the business model to make any of

1286
01:19:56,631 --> 01:20:01,610
this work financially? Yeah. Well, I mean,
you don't want to be a dill town, right?

1287
01:20:01,850 --> 01:20:06,200
Um, and, and so, you know,
my biggest fear is that,

1288
01:20:06,380 --> 01:20:08,100
um,
it would work

1289
01:20:08,310 --> 01:20:13,050
in an artistic way, but
wouldn't work as a business. Uh,

1290
01:20:13,110 --> 01:20:16,530
and so, you know, the, the, the answer is,

1291
01:20:16,531 --> 01:20:20,100
at the beginning we didn't,
I didn't do much. Um,

1292
01:20:20,190 --> 01:20:25,050
I handled all of our marketing and PR,
like I wrote everything,

1293
01:20:25,070 --> 01:20:27,270
you know, myself. Um,

1294
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:32,670
really thought about open sourcing the,
the building of the restaurant.

1295
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:33,540
Um,

1296
01:20:33,540 --> 01:20:38,540
you can still go on line and see that the
original business plans and what logos

1297
01:20:39,871 --> 01:20:43,800
we were considering using and to the
test kitchen, which was in my house.

1298
01:20:43,830 --> 01:20:45,150
You know,
we didn't tell anyone at the time,

1299
01:20:45,151 --> 01:20:47,640
but that was my house at the time and,

1300
01:20:47,700 --> 01:20:50,130
and see the development
of this restaurant. Um,

1301
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:54,180
and I felt like the open
source movement in that way,

1302
01:20:54,181 --> 01:20:57,300
it was a good model for what we
were trying to, to accomplish.

1303
01:20:57,570 --> 01:21:00,180
And part of that was people
would say like a restaurant,

1304
01:21:00,181 --> 01:21:03,150
like this can't make money.
And you know,

1305
01:21:03,151 --> 01:21:05,970
I wrote this little spreadsheet that
I called the universal restaurant

1306
01:21:05,971 --> 01:21:10,740
calculator and can people
find that online? No, no,

1307
01:21:10,741 --> 01:21:14,490
no. But it would be very unimpressive.
Um, if they could. But it was,

1308
01:21:14,790 --> 01:21:16,580
it was basically like how
many covers per night.

1309
01:21:16,590 --> 01:21:20,040
I mean this is back of the envelope stuff.
How many covers per night can you do?

1310
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:23,250
What's the check average for
food check every for beverage.

1311
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:27,390
What are your food costs, beverage
costs, labor costs was insurance costs,

1312
01:21:27,450 --> 01:21:31,030
you know, your, your lease, your rent,
like all those things. Right. Um,

1313
01:21:31,090 --> 01:21:33,810
and I had enough experience with most
of those things to at least give good

1314
01:21:33,811 --> 01:21:34,644
estimates to it.

1315
01:21:34,830 --> 01:21:37,800
And so I started doing is I started
modeling other restaurants using the

1316
01:21:37,830 --> 01:21:42,660
universal restaurant calculator.
And um, I had, again,

1317
01:21:42,661 --> 01:21:44,010
this goes to the transparency of data.

1318
01:21:44,011 --> 01:21:49,011
I had real data for only two restaurants
and from those two I would then make

1319
01:21:49,591 --> 01:21:53,310
assumptions about restaurants like the
French laundry where grant used to work.

1320
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:56,100
Well, while the greatest restaurants
in the history of America, certainly.

1321
01:21:56,670 --> 01:22:00,060
And you know,
I came up with a number that grant went,

1322
01:22:00,061 --> 01:22:02,490
there's no way the revenues that
high or they make that much money,

1323
01:22:02,491 --> 01:22:06,470
that's impossible. And it was really
funny because years later, um, you know,

1324
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:09,600
I now work with, with
chef Keller, um, and he's,

1325
01:22:09,630 --> 01:22:11,070
he's a friend all these years later.

1326
01:22:11,430 --> 01:22:15,270
And I literally pulled that out one day
with grant being there and went like,

1327
01:22:15,271 --> 01:22:18,480
how close am I on this back
in 2005? And he's like, oh,

1328
01:22:18,481 --> 01:22:22,290
you're within like two or 3%. You know?
And, and grant was just like, and it's,

1329
01:22:22,470 --> 01:22:25,590
we're talking about back of the envelope
stuff. And so, you know, you asked like,

1330
01:22:25,591 --> 01:22:28,980
where can people start to
start a business? Start on
the back of an envelope.

1331
01:22:29,850 --> 01:22:34,850
Like one of my favorite exercises is to
sit in a restaurant or a small business

1332
01:22:35,011 --> 01:22:38,760
of some sort and just literally
do the back of the envelope.

1333
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:41,700
That is the kind of calculation my
dad called it the two shoe box method.

1334
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:43,140
Put me through college,
right?

1335
01:22:43,141 --> 01:22:46,200
Like money coming in and once you
bucks money going out and the other,

1336
01:22:46,530 --> 01:22:50,610
whatever's left is profit, you know,
um, you know, start that basic.

1337
01:22:51,390 --> 01:22:51,980
And,

1338
01:22:51,980 --> 01:22:56,850
and we did that and I didn't
really think about the,

1339
01:22:58,020 --> 01:23:01,230
we did well, but we didn't
make a ton of money. Um,

1340
01:23:01,290 --> 01:23:04,830
Alinea cost of two point
$2 million to build, um,

1341
01:23:04,860 --> 01:23:09,730
I up a little over a quarter of that
myself and found investors for the rest,

1342
01:23:09,731 --> 01:23:13,990
all of whom I knew. And, um, you know,

1343
01:23:13,991 --> 01:23:15,660
in the first year we did,
you know,

1344
01:23:15,670 --> 01:23:20,260
we made about 450 to $500,000
on four or $5 million in sales.

1345
01:23:20,980 --> 01:23:25,960
I'm not a great return, not a
terrible return. Um, we then one,

1346
01:23:26,020 --> 01:23:26,560
you know,

1347
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:30,820
best restaurant in America from Gourmet
magazine and I was horrified that we won

1348
01:23:30,821 --> 01:23:34,300
that frankly. Um, I remember
Greg called me and said, Yep,

1349
01:23:34,330 --> 01:23:35,800
I just got a call from Ruth Reichle.

1350
01:23:35,950 --> 01:23:39,400
And like we had some stated goals of like,

1351
01:23:39,820 --> 01:23:42,460
how would we know if this is a success?

1352
01:23:42,940 --> 01:23:46,180
And one of the things we wrote down was
Ruth Reichl declares it best restaurant

1353
01:23:46,181 --> 01:23:49,150
in America.
And we wrote that because in 1997,

1354
01:23:49,151 --> 01:23:52,600
she wrote the most exciting place to
eat in America as the French laundry and

1355
01:23:52,601 --> 01:23:57,400
grant was there and cook that meal and
said that the energy of having someone

1356
01:23:57,401 --> 01:24:00,580
that he respected so much,
because Ruth is just a great writer.

1357
01:24:00,940 --> 01:24:03,820
She's one of the unimpeachable food
critics in the history of America.

1358
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:08,770
And having her write that in New York
Times propelled that restaurant to its

1359
01:24:08,771 --> 01:24:12,820
permanent status. Um, I think
that can't happen nowadays,

1360
01:24:12,910 --> 01:24:17,630
honestly for other reasons, but
this is kind of pre, pre, you know,

1361
01:24:17,950 --> 01:24:19,450
Internet for Yelp,
all that.

1362
01:24:20,140 --> 01:24:25,140
And then all of a sudden we got that
and I was like horrified because,

1363
01:24:26,110 --> 01:24:29,470
you know, one of the goals was
completed so early we would have,

1364
01:24:29,471 --> 01:24:33,700
we wouldn't have our, like our
Lodestar, you know, and so, um,

1365
01:24:34,270 --> 01:24:36,850
he was like, Dear God, can you
let me enjoy it for like a minute

1366
01:24:37,980 --> 01:24:42,560
to you? Yeah. All right. You know,

1367
01:24:42,950 --> 01:24:45,920
I was happy, but I was also
like, oh no, now what do we do?

1368
01:24:46,710 --> 01:24:50,130
We need to find another artificial
constructs here. Like go after

1369
01:24:52,590 --> 01:24:55,260
enough of this, I need to find
happiness and get this other happiness.

1370
01:24:55,261 --> 01:24:58,460
I that in head out of my face.
So it's about,

1371
01:24:58,650 --> 01:25:00,270
I really do believe that actually,

1372
01:25:00,580 --> 01:25:04,060
that it's often the process is so real or

1373
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:08,700
wording that when you get something done,
it can be a letdown, you know? And, um,

1374
01:25:08,701 --> 01:25:11,230
I wanted that process to go.
And then unfortunately,

1375
01:25:11,250 --> 01:25:15,360
six months later at grant was diagnosed
with stage four cancer and given six

1376
01:25:15,361 --> 01:25:20,190
months to live. Um, and so weirdly,

1377
01:25:20,191 --> 01:25:24,660
that was the moment where after he was
going through treatment where I started

1378
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:27,360
going into the restaurant at night,

1379
01:25:27,361 --> 01:25:29,160
cause remember I'm not
a service professional,

1380
01:25:29,700 --> 01:25:32,000
I was running the business
of the restaurant. Um,

1381
01:25:32,730 --> 01:25:35,550
I would start going in at night and
asking really dumb questions again.

1382
01:25:36,540 --> 01:25:39,460
And you know, weirdly, um,

1383
01:25:40,650 --> 01:25:45,650
our goal was to keep Alinea open
for when he came back and my do,

1384
01:25:45,891 --> 01:25:47,850
he only missed like, you know, 12 days,

1385
01:25:47,851 --> 01:25:52,851
14 days of service during really
intense chemo and radiation and,

1386
01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:57,270
but he was given six months to live.
And you know,

1387
01:25:57,480 --> 01:26:01,950
when people are in that situation
and their livelihood is tied to this

1388
01:26:01,951 --> 01:26:03,770
restaurant,
um,

1389
01:26:04,370 --> 01:26:06,710
even despite their loyalties,

1390
01:26:06,740 --> 01:26:09,710
oftentimes they just need to find
another job because they were like, hey,

1391
01:26:09,711 --> 01:26:11,660
in four months,
this place is going to be closed.

1392
01:26:12,740 --> 01:26:16,340
So it was in, in, in the midst of that,

1393
01:26:16,341 --> 01:26:20,870
we decided to do our first book,
really, Dick Chronicle. Um, you know,

1394
01:26:20,871 --> 01:26:23,390
his, his, you know,

1395
01:26:23,420 --> 01:26:27,140
what he had accomplished because for
him he felt like that'd be his legacy.

1396
01:26:28,060 --> 01:26:31,040
Um, he thought he was going to die.
He was told he was going to die.

1397
01:26:31,820 --> 01:26:36,820
So in the midst of managing a
self created self published book,

1398
01:26:38,420 --> 01:26:39,253
um,

1399
01:26:39,290 --> 01:26:44,290
and trying to do that differently and
then keeping a dwindling staff motivated,

1400
01:26:44,930 --> 01:26:48,080
I'm trying to let him know that it
would still be there when he got, well,

1401
01:26:48,110 --> 01:26:52,480
all of that I started going, this
place is run in strange ways, man,

1402
01:26:52,490 --> 01:26:56,090
this industry is, is, is
not run right. You know,

1403
01:26:56,270 --> 01:26:58,970
and I started asking like basic questions,

1404
01:26:58,971 --> 01:27:01,820
like if we have a waitlist for a
hundred people on a, on a Wednesday,

1405
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:05,480
why do we do 74 people on a
Wednesday but 86 on a Saturday?

1406
01:27:07,250 --> 01:27:12,200
And the answer was, because our
incentives are misaligned, you know,

1407
01:27:12,201 --> 01:27:16,490
the service industry as a whole can't
run it 100% every single day of the week

1408
01:27:16,970 --> 01:27:21,020
and less they're incentivized to do
so. And you could go like, well yeah,

1409
01:27:21,021 --> 01:27:24,110
but every server there will make an
extra hundred bucks a night or whatever.

1410
01:27:24,470 --> 01:27:27,890
But they're kind of going like, look,
if every night was Saturday I'd be dead.

1411
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:30,080
It's really hard work,
you know?

1412
01:27:30,590 --> 01:27:33,610
So you need to figure out ways
of load balancing that, um,

1413
01:27:33,740 --> 01:27:36,680
and making every day the same
and you end up way ahead.

1414
01:27:36,980 --> 01:27:39,380
So from a business perspective,
um,

1415
01:27:39,530 --> 01:27:42,950
that's when my sort of self education,
uh,

1416
01:27:43,010 --> 01:27:45,200
in this industry came,

1417
01:27:45,290 --> 01:27:50,290
came forward and it came forward in a
way that I think I was less patient with

1418
01:27:50,391 --> 01:27:54,110
everything because we were also going
through this really difficult emotional

1419
01:27:54,590 --> 01:27:56,060
time.
Um,

1420
01:27:56,270 --> 01:28:00,620
and so consequently when I didn't
get answers that made any sense,

1421
01:28:00,650 --> 01:28:03,500
instead of being diplomatic about it, I
would just be like, well that's stupid,

1422
01:28:05,290 --> 01:28:06,123
you know,
and it was,

1423
01:28:06,220 --> 01:28:10,310
which cut some of the normal social filter
off and I'm sure it wasn't a pleasant

1424
01:28:10,311 --> 01:28:12,350
time to be around anybody.

1425
01:28:12,980 --> 01:28:16,010
But I also think it was accepted within
that environment at that time because

1426
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:20,510
everyone knew what we were going through.
And so when we,

1427
01:28:20,870 --> 01:28:24,200
you know, years, years later when we
finally like, we're kind of like, hey,

1428
01:28:24,201 --> 01:28:27,140
we've got some ideas to build next.
And the Aviary,

1429
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:29,150
that's when I kind of went like,
well,

1430
01:28:29,151 --> 01:28:33,020
we're going to do things
totally differently here. And
anyone who's not on board,

1431
01:28:33,050 --> 01:28:36,410
even though they work for us, like if
you're not on board all the way in,

1432
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:40,810
like on getting rid of normal reservations
on not using telephones on doing all

1433
01:28:40,830 --> 01:28:44,810
these things, I'm like, you know, you
just, we don't have a place for you here.

1434
01:28:45,890 --> 01:28:50,810
Um, and man, it really worked. You
know, that was the basis of, you know,

1435
01:28:50,811 --> 01:28:55,490
I talked to every software company in
the industry asking for their API and is

1436
01:28:55,491 --> 01:29:00,320
asking to build essentially what's
options pricing software on top of

1437
01:29:00,321 --> 01:29:03,660
reservation and open table told me no.

1438
01:29:03,750 --> 01:29:08,190
And the pos systems told me no. Um,
I called theaters and went like,

1439
01:29:08,191 --> 01:29:12,600
what ticketing system do
you use? [inaudible] and all
those told me no. And um,

1440
01:29:13,290 --> 01:29:15,200
so I heard a single programmer,
um,

1441
01:29:15,270 --> 01:29:19,710
and he and I in six weeks built a
really rudimentary booking system,

1442
01:29:19,711 --> 01:29:23,010
but the first day we turned it on
and we sold $562,000 of tickets to a

1443
01:29:23,011 --> 01:29:26,980
restaurant for the first time. First time
ever. Okay. So pause here for a second.

1444
01:29:27,640 --> 01:29:29,580
No, no, no. This is great. This is great.

1445
01:29:29,581 --> 01:29:32,840
So a few a few things for folks
who are not familiar. Api,

1446
01:29:32,841 --> 01:29:34,710
APP application programming interface.

1447
01:29:34,711 --> 01:29:38,700
It's how you can effectively link
into someone else's software.

1448
01:29:38,701 --> 01:29:42,860
Pos point of sale, not piece of
shit. And it is a piece of shit. Oh,

1449
01:29:42,890 --> 01:29:45,360
it may also be a piece of shit.
What was,

1450
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:49,950
what were the design specs that you
were looking for? In other words,

1451
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:55,640
before you get to the 500,000
plus gay at the snap of a fingers,

1452
01:29:56,340 --> 01:30:00,270
like what were you trying to fix
or what were you trying to create?

1453
01:30:01,140 --> 01:30:04,580
So I get a lot of grief for
this, for saying this, um,

1454
01:30:04,650 --> 01:30:06,030
in the industry and in the press,

1455
01:30:06,031 --> 01:30:09,330
but basically whenever you
make a restaurant reservation,

1456
01:30:09,390 --> 01:30:12,390
one of the two of you talking
is lying to each other.

1457
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:18,490
If you think about it, nor their
industry form of entertainment, uh,

1458
01:30:18,920 --> 01:30:21,930
which dining out is a form of
entertainment. I know it's sustenance.

1459
01:30:21,990 --> 01:30:24,420
I know there's so much culture
embedded in it and all that,

1460
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:27,950
but you could eat at home, right? Um,

1461
01:30:29,100 --> 01:30:32,070
no other form of entertainment.
You just call them up and say, Hey,

1462
01:30:32,071 --> 01:30:37,071
hold a seat to the bears game or the
cubs game or the opera and I'll show up

1463
01:30:37,711 --> 01:30:41,430
around seven 30 and then
they tell you, yeah, yeah,

1464
01:30:41,431 --> 01:30:44,610
we'll have a seat ready for you at seven
30. And then when you get there, they go,

1465
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:45,151
oh,
you know what,

1466
01:30:45,151 --> 01:30:47,700
go wait over there for 30 or 40 minutes
because we're running a little behind

1467
01:30:47,701 --> 01:30:49,890
tonight. You know? Um,

1468
01:30:49,950 --> 01:30:53,190
the reason that they're running behind
is because they overbooked because about

1469
01:30:53,191 --> 01:30:57,900
15 to 18% of the people just
don't show up. So they overbook.

1470
01:30:58,110 --> 01:31:02,580
They also know that if they tell you that
they'll really see you at nine and you

1471
01:31:02,581 --> 01:31:03,510
wanted an eight 15,

1472
01:31:03,511 --> 01:31:06,360
you'll just go to the restaurant down the
street from them that will lie to them.

1473
01:31:07,680 --> 01:31:10,020
Right? Right. So, so they,

1474
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:15,200
so they do that and ultimately
it's just bad all around.

1475
01:31:16,231 --> 01:31:19,570
It's bad for the restaurant.
It's wasteful for food. Um,

1476
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:23,220
and it's bad hospitality,
like, and that's like,

1477
01:31:23,370 --> 01:31:28,370
there are so many pop culture
references and entire Sitcom,

1478
01:31:28,990 --> 01:31:32,220
you know, episodes built around someone
trying to get into a restaurant. Right.

1479
01:31:32,550 --> 01:31:35,850
It's absurd. It's completely
absurd. And you know,

1480
01:31:35,851 --> 01:31:40,380
I looked at our no show rate at
Alinea datadriven tracked it.

1481
01:31:40,770 --> 01:31:44,220
I looked at our,
what we call short seated tables,

1482
01:31:44,250 --> 01:31:47,580
like the number of tables that were
four people, but only two showed up.

1483
01:31:48,090 --> 01:31:50,310
And the dirty secret there
is like people would go like,

1484
01:31:50,311 --> 01:31:54,270
well what do you have available a while?
I have an eight 30 for four okay,

1485
01:31:54,271 --> 01:31:56,970
we'll take that. And they never
intended to bring the other two people.

1486
01:31:57,270 --> 01:31:59,410
Well that's just as bad as a to tap Shawn,

1487
01:32:00,370 --> 01:32:04,120
we only have 74 people in there and
so it's a yield manager or 74 seats.

1488
01:32:04,270 --> 01:32:07,240
So it's a yield management problem.
And so we,

1489
01:32:07,270 --> 01:32:12,270
five to 8% of our revenue every night
was was being lost to that transaction.

1490
01:32:13,270 --> 01:32:15,280
That was a non transaction.
Right.

1491
01:32:15,970 --> 01:32:19,330
And so I wanted to figure out
ways to do two things. One,

1492
01:32:20,240 --> 01:32:23,800
what to figure out ways to make
it transactional. Because again,

1493
01:32:23,801 --> 01:32:24,970
you asked about Professor Thaler,

1494
01:32:24,971 --> 01:32:27,790
one of the key tenants is as a little
bit of skin in the game, right?

1495
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:33,010
When people have small vested interest in
something and the outcome of something.

1496
01:32:33,190 --> 01:32:36,850
Or even if I gave you a pencil as a
gift and then 30 minutes later I want to

1497
01:32:36,851 --> 01:32:40,090
take it back, you will get so mad even
though you didn't care about that pencil.

1498
01:32:41,380 --> 01:32:44,980
Right, right. Cause you're like,
what was, that dude gave me a gift.

1499
01:32:44,980 --> 01:32:47,240
Now he's pulling it back and you know,
it's like the expected,

1500
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:49,030
it's like the expected value of a mug.

1501
01:32:49,031 --> 01:32:52,630
If you ask them how much they would spend
to buy the mug versus giving them the

1502
01:32:52,631 --> 01:32:55,660
Mug and saying, how much will you accept
to sell it? You know the differential.

1503
01:32:55,900 --> 01:33:00,590
Yes. Huge. So you know, that
came to me one day because my,

1504
01:33:00,850 --> 01:33:04,240
my kids wanted to go see a movie at
night that I did not want to go see.

1505
01:33:04,930 --> 01:33:06,400
And I was really,

1506
01:33:06,401 --> 01:33:11,140
really like I would have easily paid 50
bucks to not go to this movie. Right?

1507
01:33:11,230 --> 01:33:16,090
Yeah. And then my wife basically says,
Hey, well let's go to that movie.

1508
01:33:16,091 --> 01:33:20,050
So I go on Fandango, I buy four
tickets, 60 bucks, whatever it was,

1509
01:33:20,610 --> 01:33:21,880
and it like five 30 at night.

1510
01:33:21,881 --> 01:33:25,540
It's pouring rain and everyone's
napping and they're like, yeah,

1511
01:33:25,541 --> 01:33:28,360
I don't want to go. And I'm
like, get your asses in the car.

1512
01:33:28,361 --> 01:33:33,100
We're going to the movie man, easily
paid that $60 to not go to the movie.

1513
01:33:33,490 --> 01:33:37,300
But once I had the sunk cost of,
of paying for the movie,

1514
01:33:38,380 --> 01:33:42,230
my psychology totally flipped.
And I was like,

1515
01:33:42,231 --> 01:33:44,500
we're going to this movie that
I don't want to go to like,

1516
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:49,570
and I literally irrationally made
everyone go to the movie. Like,

1517
01:33:49,960 --> 01:33:54,850
which weirdly costs, you know,
I mean, from an emotional
family standpoint, all bad,

1518
01:33:54,851 --> 01:33:59,590
all the way around. Right. And um, so I,
I thought about it and I was like, wow,

1519
01:33:59,591 --> 01:34:00,460
what if people,

1520
01:34:00,820 --> 01:34:05,080
what do people put down a small deposit
on times when demand exceeds supply?

1521
01:34:05,410 --> 01:34:08,330
Like, right. So Saturday night,
eight o'clock, great. That's uh,

1522
01:34:08,410 --> 01:34:10,570
that's the best seats at the Opera House.

1523
01:34:11,050 --> 01:34:14,350
Let's see if people will prepaid for
that or put down 20 bucks for it.

1524
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:17,470
That's fully credited at the end of
their meal. It's not a cover charge.

1525
01:34:17,770 --> 01:34:20,200
I'm not trying to squeeze people
in the actual cost of the meal.

1526
01:34:20,500 --> 01:34:22,900
I'm just trying to go like, yeah, let's
see if people will make a commitment.

1527
01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:26,290
And everybody told me, no,
no one's going to do that.

1528
01:34:26,740 --> 01:34:29,890
Like this is not the way it works.
But if you look back historically,

1529
01:34:30,040 --> 01:34:31,870
and this is the interesting part again,

1530
01:34:31,871 --> 01:34:35,620
it's about like digging in
deep on something and if
you look back historically,

1531
01:34:36,100 --> 01:34:36,933
um,

1532
01:34:37,180 --> 01:34:42,040
restaurant reservations started with the
telephone and at the time that we were

1533
01:34:42,190 --> 01:34:44,170
starting to do this,
the telephone was dying.

1534
01:34:45,820 --> 01:34:48,550
And I didn't know that at the time,
you know, it was eight years ago,

1535
01:34:49,030 --> 01:34:53,230
but I have a computer in my pocket and
if you ring me and I don't know your

1536
01:34:53,231 --> 01:34:55,270
number, I don't want to talk
to you, I don't answer it.

1537
01:34:55,840 --> 01:34:58,100
I'd much rather receive
like a little piece

1538
01:34:58,100 --> 01:35:02,630
of text letting me know what's going on.
Then a phone call.

1539
01:35:03,200 --> 01:35:03,530
Um,

1540
01:35:03,530 --> 01:35:07,280
similarly like calling a restaurant is
an antiquated thing to do at this point.

1541
01:35:07,460 --> 01:35:12,460
But long before the telephone people got
room and board and what room and board

1542
01:35:12,501 --> 01:35:16,430
was literally,
it was like you go to an inn and you,

1543
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:19,430
you get a room for the night
and then do you need food? Okay,

1544
01:35:19,431 --> 01:35:23,690
well you got a board of food that was
literally it and you'd prepay for it.

1545
01:35:25,400 --> 01:35:26,690
And so,
you know,

1546
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:30,950
there was hundreds of years of that long
before there was a telephone and people

1547
01:35:30,951 --> 01:35:34,570
called and said, Yep, like, you know,
I'd like to eat at your restaurant. Sure,

1548
01:35:34,590 --> 01:35:36,360
we'll let you know.
And um,

1549
01:35:36,500 --> 01:35:41,500
and so as the technology for
the telephone has morphed into,

1550
01:35:42,290 --> 01:35:45,160
you know, what we all have
in our pockets now, um,

1551
01:35:45,290 --> 01:35:47,540
I just wanted to update
that whole transaction.

1552
01:35:47,810 --> 01:35:52,810
And so I also wanted to acknowledge
that Tuesday nights it should be cheaper

1553
01:35:52,911 --> 01:35:56,000
than a Saturday night.
So it has to work in both ways.

1554
01:35:56,001 --> 01:35:57,980
I always thought Uber could to fix their,

1555
01:35:58,280 --> 01:36:01,940
their surge pricing issues
by having discounted pricing
when there was no demand,

1556
01:36:02,120 --> 01:36:03,800
like just move pricing in two directions.

1557
01:36:04,370 --> 01:36:06,170
And if you have pricing in two directions,

1558
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:10,580
then like that whole argument
goes away. Right. Um, and so,

1559
01:36:11,240 --> 01:36:12,410
so we did that. We, we,

1560
01:36:12,430 --> 01:36:16,430
we priced out different prices by
day of the week and times a day.

1561
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:21,260
So 5:00 PM on Wednesday at Alinea is still
cheaper than 8:00 PM on a Saturday by

1562
01:36:21,261 --> 01:36:25,850
a lot, by 80 to a hundred
dollars a person. Wow. Um, and,

1563
01:36:25,940 --> 01:36:29,370
and you know, what happens, um,
and this is now we have, you know,

1564
01:36:29,390 --> 01:36:33,020
hundreds of restaurants doing this
on our software called talk. Um,

1565
01:36:33,590 --> 01:36:37,310
what happens is people buy
the most expensive seats
first and the cheapest seats

1566
01:36:37,311 --> 01:36:41,480
first, which is exactly what
you'd expect actually, right?

1567
01:36:42,530 --> 01:36:45,380
Because there's some people who are
price conscious and go like, wow,

1568
01:36:45,381 --> 01:36:47,390
this is a really expensive meal,
but holy cow,

1569
01:36:47,391 --> 01:36:49,820
I don't really care if I eat at
five o'clock on a Tuesday. Great.

1570
01:36:50,030 --> 01:36:53,450
Like I can save 400 bucks. Um, and
then there's some people that go like,

1571
01:36:53,510 --> 01:36:57,170
I only eat at 8:00 PM on Saturday. Well,
okay, that's fine. Pay a little more.

1572
01:36:58,430 --> 01:37:02,270
Or they're attracted to the fact
that it is the most expensive. Sure.

1573
01:37:02,360 --> 01:37:05,810
That happens too. And then
there's, there's a whole bunch
of tools. Then over time,

1574
01:37:05,811 --> 01:37:09,170
we built on top of that to sell wine
pairings or sell books. You know,

1575
01:37:09,171 --> 01:37:13,820
we sell 20 Alinea books a day on
checkout with the booking process.

1576
01:37:15,110 --> 01:37:18,050
That's all ton because we're not going
to exit through the gift shop at Alinea.

1577
01:37:18,051 --> 01:37:19,250
It's a Michelin Three Star restaurant.

1578
01:37:20,200 --> 01:37:23,300
So we would suddenly have like one book,

1579
01:37:23,330 --> 01:37:25,340
like near the restrooms
that people could peruse,

1580
01:37:25,430 --> 01:37:27,590
but it didn't say like by the
book or anything like that.

1581
01:37:27,860 --> 01:37:31,100
So typically we'd sell like
one or two per night. Um,

1582
01:37:31,370 --> 01:37:35,000
now on checkout, when you
book Alinea, it says, hey,

1583
01:37:35,001 --> 01:37:39,810
would you like to buy and Alinea book
personalized and 20 people a night get it

1584
01:37:39,860 --> 01:37:44,630
at that has $400,000 in revenue a year.
Yeah. That's incredible. Easy. Right?

1585
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:49,850
And it's amazing to me that no one did
that beforehand because ultimately people

1586
01:37:49,851 --> 01:37:54,740
can't buy what they don't see and people
don't want to be upsold inside of a

1587
01:37:54,741 --> 01:37:58,410
restaurant. There's nothing
worse in my mind then, you know,

1588
01:37:58,440 --> 01:38:02,000
some places that today's special is
today's special and it's real and you,

1589
01:38:02,030 --> 01:38:05,220
you kind of know that,
but sometimes it's just the old fish,

1590
01:38:07,530 --> 01:38:11,250
right? Uh, Sunday night

1591
01:38:13,700 --> 01:38:15,480
and we all know these things.
And like,

1592
01:38:15,740 --> 01:38:18,860
I think no restaurant wants to like raise
their hand to go, Yep, that's all true.

1593
01:38:19,190 --> 01:38:22,130
We were aligned to our customers and
we're not going to release it you at eight

1594
01:38:22,131 --> 01:38:26,030
15. And so I think when I said that, like
you can look back through some articles,

1595
01:38:26,120 --> 01:38:27,830
um,
I remember that there's an article,

1596
01:38:27,831 --> 01:38:32,540
I think it was in Gq that they
interviewed like a grizzled veteran,

1597
01:38:32,541 --> 01:38:35,710
you know, and he didn't use his
name and said, you know, um,

1598
01:38:35,880 --> 01:38:38,540
overbook in a bar to weight
and has always worked for me.

1599
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:41,450
And I was just like,

1600
01:38:41,480 --> 01:38:44,480
how does that not sound like terrible
hospitality to everyone reading that,

1601
01:38:44,780 --> 01:38:49,270
you know? Yeah, for sure.
Yeah. Yeah. There's,

1602
01:38:49,340 --> 01:38:54,340
there's so many systems that have a
similar overbooking load balancing issues,

1603
01:38:57,471 --> 01:39:02,170
right? You'd look at airlines, you
look at hospitality. Yep. Eat dentist.

1604
01:39:02,570 --> 01:39:06,920
Yeah. I have a great dentist. They
only do it via phone call or email.

1605
01:39:07,190 --> 01:39:08,930
And so I have to play a guessing game.

1606
01:39:09,080 --> 01:39:11,900
It's like going into a clothing
store and going like, yeah,

1607
01:39:11,901 --> 01:39:15,560
I'm looking for a blue v-neck
cashmere sweater. Like, Nah,

1608
01:39:15,590 --> 01:39:16,640
don't have one guest again,

1609
01:39:20,360 --> 01:39:22,620
put the shit on display man.
Like,

1610
01:39:22,621 --> 01:39:24,630
just tell me what days
you could clean my teeth,

1611
01:39:24,660 --> 01:39:28,840
show me and I'll just go online
and hit the button, you know?

1612
01:39:30,380 --> 01:39:35,300
So when you then debuted the,

1613
01:39:35,330 --> 01:39:38,840
uh, the, the ticketing
option, if I'm, if I'm,

1614
01:39:39,010 --> 01:39:43,520
if I'm labeling it properly,
how did you prime the pump for that?

1615
01:39:43,521 --> 01:39:47,540
Was there anything, did you need
to prime the pump to have this,

1616
01:39:47,541 --> 01:39:52,500
what seems like certainly
a windfall? Yeah, we did a,

1617
01:39:52,620 --> 01:39:55,550
a, a, a video where, you know,

1618
01:39:55,551 --> 01:39:59,630
next restaurant was about a restaurant
that's always knew essentially like

1619
01:39:59,631 --> 01:40:03,230
what's, what's one of the big problems
of the restaurant industry? Well,

1620
01:40:03,231 --> 01:40:05,360
when you open a new restaurant,
it doesn't matter what it is,

1621
01:40:05,361 --> 01:40:09,830
people are gonna show up for like five
or six months. And then after that,

1622
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:13,640
um, you know, you got to struggle to
like get regulars and, and you know,

1623
01:40:13,700 --> 01:40:18,140
like find new audiences and all of that.
But people like the new quote unquote.

1624
01:40:18,170 --> 01:40:20,540
Right. Um, the other problem is,

1625
01:40:20,541 --> 01:40:25,541
is that our own staff in chefs where the
kind of people who I said to grant one

1626
01:40:25,641 --> 01:40:28,220
time,
he cooked this amazing French dish for me.

1627
01:40:28,220 --> 01:40:31,550
It'll neo right in the middle of his
sickness because I had driven down from

1628
01:40:31,551 --> 01:40:35,060
Michigan, I've never eaten before
or after in the Alinea kitchen,

1629
01:40:35,061 --> 01:40:38,600
but he whipped up this little French
dish for me of duck. And I was like, man,

1630
01:40:38,601 --> 01:40:40,880
let's open a French restaurant
some day. And he went like, ah,

1631
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:44,890
we'll get bored after six
months. And then I was at, um,

1632
01:40:45,050 --> 01:40:47,890
one of our chefs homes on a
day off Tuesday and he made,

1633
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:52,130
he loves Thai food and he made
this amazing Thai meal. Amazing.

1634
01:40:52,730 --> 01:40:56,680
And I like, wow, like I had no idea.
These guys are so versatile, you know?

1635
01:40:56,681 --> 01:41:00,220
And then it made sense, hey, these are
passionate, amazingly talented people.

1636
01:41:01,060 --> 01:41:02,890
And it kind of dawned on me like,

1637
01:41:02,950 --> 01:41:06,550
let's just change the restaurant every
four months, you know, let's, let's do,

1638
01:41:06,580 --> 01:41:10,450
and then we dwelled on that for like
a year thinking like it was kind of

1639
01:41:10,451 --> 01:41:15,340
impossible to do. And then
you know, grandson, I said,

1640
01:41:15,341 --> 01:41:18,070
well let's start with the French menu.
And he's like, well what does that mean?

1641
01:41:18,130 --> 01:41:21,880
Like there's southern France,
there's lower valley, there's France,

1642
01:41:21,910 --> 01:41:24,670
that's the nouvelle cuisine. And then
there's friends from like, you know,

1643
01:41:24,700 --> 01:41:27,970
a hundred years ago. Totally
different. And I was like, Yup,

1644
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:32,680
Paris 1906 I don't need to explain to
you what that is you'd want to eat that.

1645
01:41:32,950 --> 01:41:35,650
If I just said like if someone said, Hey,
new restaurant opening, what's the menu?

1646
01:41:35,680 --> 01:41:38,800
It's Paris 1906 I'd go like,
cool.

1647
01:41:38,830 --> 01:41:41,320
Like I want to do a little time
travel and see what that was like.

1648
01:41:41,860 --> 01:41:44,980
And so as soon as we had
like a city in a time,

1649
01:41:45,850 --> 01:41:49,450
we instantly knew that was the idea
that kept us up at night. You know,

1650
01:41:49,451 --> 01:41:50,440
where we went, like, wow,

1651
01:41:50,470 --> 01:41:54,460
look at all these different places we
can travel and what does that restaurant

1652
01:41:54,461 --> 01:41:57,640
look like and how do you create a kitchen
versatile enough to make all these

1653
01:41:57,641 --> 01:42:01,390
different cuisines and how do you make
it not feel like Disneyland where one

1654
01:42:01,391 --> 01:42:04,240
time you have a theme of Paris and
next time you have a theme of Japan.

1655
01:42:04,480 --> 01:42:09,340
So you have to go for like an austere
minimalism, you know. And um, is this,

1656
01:42:09,341 --> 01:42:13,180
what's usually the reason why you
chose the year 1906, you know,

1657
01:42:13,210 --> 01:42:15,490
I'm doing some research. Um, uh,

1658
01:42:15,500 --> 01:42:18,010
and I may get the exact date wrong
cause this is eight years ago I did the

1659
01:42:18,011 --> 01:42:21,520
research,
but I believe the sen flooded in 1908,

1660
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:26,900
somewhere around there. Um,
and so, um, a scuff ea, um,

1661
01:42:26,950 --> 01:42:31,720
like the father of French
cuisine, um, was at the Ritz then.

1662
01:42:32,170 --> 01:42:36,550
And that was kind of like the
height of that era of cuisine.

1663
01:42:36,850 --> 01:42:38,680
And then after the sen flooded,

1664
01:42:38,770 --> 01:42:43,690
that's where you got sort of your bras
reason bistros because they had to kind

1665
01:42:43,691 --> 01:42:48,430
of go to a more casual,
it opened up for more people.

1666
01:42:49,120 --> 01:42:50,500
Took the price point down,

1667
01:42:50,530 --> 01:42:54,760
it made it more approachable and it wiped
out dozens of these fancy restaurants.

1668
01:42:54,761 --> 01:42:57,670
And so like rent got cheap
and all of a sudden like, hey,

1669
01:42:57,671 --> 01:43:01,510
like we're gonna get this new style of
restaurant that's roughly, as I recall it,

1670
01:43:01,511 --> 01:43:04,240
somebody's going to listen to this
and tell me I'm all wrong. But um,

1671
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:09,700
that's where we landed because we
could do this a scuff ea menu and boy,

1672
01:43:09,701 --> 01:43:12,910
we argued about that too,
like in their blenders then so,

1673
01:43:13,060 --> 01:43:16,270
so like electric blenders.
So I mean we just like,

1674
01:43:16,750 --> 01:43:20,420
so you wanted to mimic the
production? Well, I did.

1675
01:43:20,580 --> 01:43:24,700
Grant did not so, so, so we, we, we were,

1676
01:43:24,701 --> 01:43:28,990
I remember we were at a, we invited
the press to a practice and it's like,

1677
01:43:28,991 --> 01:43:32,500
Hey pal, you don't have to
make the food. He was like,

1678
01:43:32,680 --> 01:43:37,180
should we make it intentionally
worse than we can? Yeah.

1679
01:43:37,181 --> 01:43:41,410
I guess the recipes were really vague.
They didn't even call for salt. Yeah. So,

1680
01:43:41,411 --> 01:43:45,340
so in the middle of this press dinner
where we had like the New York Times that

1681
01:43:45,341 --> 01:43:49,090
we had all sorts of these people there,
which I will never do again. Right.

1682
01:43:49,091 --> 01:43:52,790
That was just a genuine error.
Like and like,

1683
01:43:53,390 --> 01:43:58,190
like we were still arguing
out conceptually what this
thing would be and then we

1684
01:43:58,191 --> 01:44:00,550
serve dinner and we were like openly,

1685
01:44:00,830 --> 01:44:04,760
like he'd come out of the kitchen and we
would openly argue about it, you know?

1686
01:44:05,510 --> 01:44:09,020
And this is at the press
dinner? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1687
01:44:10,730 --> 01:44:14,090
I remember he brought the soup out and
it was like, you know, he was like,

1688
01:44:14,540 --> 01:44:18,260
I was like, oh they must have used
like the actual blenders, right,

1689
01:44:18,261 --> 01:44:21,950
like modern blenders. Cause it was like
the mouth feel is like perfect. Right.

1690
01:44:22,490 --> 01:44:26,060
And so I was like, oh you, you use the
blenders, you know? And he was like,

1691
01:44:26,360 --> 01:44:29,180
the recipe didn't call for salt
either did it, but I should,

1692
01:44:29,181 --> 01:44:33,560
I have not used that and had it
tastes like shit. And then I was like,

1693
01:44:33,620 --> 01:44:36,260
well maybe you don't know that they
didn't have refrigeration then either.

1694
01:44:36,261 --> 01:44:39,380
And they packed the vegetables
insult as a desiccant.

1695
01:44:39,740 --> 01:44:42,500
And so there were almost all pretty
self did by the time they get to Paris.

1696
01:44:43,160 --> 01:44:46,550
And that was it. Like people were just
like, these guys don't like each other.

1697
01:44:48,530 --> 01:44:53,320
But that was, that was, that's our method.
That's what we did, you know. And um,

1698
01:44:53,390 --> 01:44:58,360
I mean to the day we opened, we
had those, those arguments. Um,

1699
01:44:58,400 --> 01:45:01,610
and then, you know, in terms
of the software, like, man,

1700
01:45:01,611 --> 01:45:04,640
like I didn't sleep for a week.
Um, we set it up on Rackspace.

1701
01:45:04,820 --> 01:45:09,020
It didn't work right. I had never done
anything like that before. Um, you know,

1702
01:45:09,050 --> 01:45:13,540
it was like no one would help,
I think. Like, like, you know,

1703
01:45:13,640 --> 01:45:16,340
nobody would help no one. We,
and I say nobody would help.

1704
01:45:16,341 --> 01:45:21,240
You mean competitors potential. Uh, I
don't even know to tell potential. Like,

1705
01:45:21,290 --> 01:45:24,710
these are people, I got
it. Why wouldn't they help?

1706
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:30,800
Don't, you know, like in the case
of open table, they had a monopoly.

1707
01:45:31,310 --> 01:45:35,270
So why, what makes sense to me? That
makes sense. In terms of everyone else,

1708
01:45:35,271 --> 01:45:36,530
I think they didn't just didn't get it,

1709
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:41,860
but even people within my
own company thought this was
a fool's errand. You know,

1710
01:45:41,900 --> 01:45:44,340
like grant for sure.
Like he will fully admit this now.

1711
01:45:44,341 --> 01:45:47,360
I thought it was a terrible idea.
Why did he think it was a terrible idea?

1712
01:45:47,930 --> 01:45:52,160
Because it's not hospitable, it's not
hospitality. It's not, it's not, it's not.

1713
01:45:52,250 --> 01:45:55,520
It's low touch, high
touch. Correct. And, and,

1714
01:45:55,550 --> 01:45:59,130
and hugely the case where, you know, I'll,

1715
01:45:59,131 --> 01:46:02,330
I'll send the price is different every
day. Like are people going to get that?

1716
01:46:02,810 --> 01:46:04,730
And I just kept looking to
other industries and I'm like,

1717
01:46:04,790 --> 01:46:05,780
no one has a problem with it.

1718
01:46:05,781 --> 01:46:08,630
When they go to a baseball game then
they're not sitting on the, uh, you know,

1719
01:46:08,631 --> 01:46:09,650
above the dugout.

1720
01:46:09,740 --> 01:46:13,910
And then like the guy who's in the third
deck back row looks down and go, oh,

1721
01:46:13,911 --> 01:46:18,740
that guy. Like he totally
stole that ticket from me.
Two different price points,

1722
01:46:18,741 --> 01:46:19,560
you know?

1723
01:46:19,560 --> 01:46:22,640
And I just feel like people inherently
get that without having to explain it to

1724
01:46:22,641 --> 01:46:24,930
them. How, if I, if I may.

1725
01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:30,040
How far in advance of the opening
where you were you hoping to launch the

1726
01:46:30,441 --> 01:46:34,610
software and when did you end
up launching the software? Yeah,

1727
01:46:35,030 --> 01:46:38,720
I launched it about seven hours
before the first dinner. Holy Shit.

1728
01:46:39,540 --> 01:46:43,550
Um, I hope to have done it four
to five weeks ahead of that.

1729
01:46:43,970 --> 01:46:47,390
It was literally one
man operation plus me,

1730
01:46:47,450 --> 01:46:50,130
like one programmer and me.
Um,

1731
01:46:50,190 --> 01:46:53,790
when we launched it, um,
Rackspace, this is 2010.

1732
01:46:54,060 --> 01:46:56,770
I'm not saying anything about,
about Rackspace. It was, I didn't,

1733
01:46:56,771 --> 01:46:59,920
I probably set it up. We're on a 2010, um,

1734
01:47:00,420 --> 01:47:04,290
it did not like it's supposed to auto
load correct. And self propagate.

1735
01:47:05,130 --> 01:47:06,660
And it neither happened.

1736
01:47:06,720 --> 01:47:10,200
I was expecting we had 17,000 people on
our email list that it's signed up on

1737
01:47:10,201 --> 01:47:13,740
the website to like be notified when
when their bookings went on sale.

1738
01:47:14,250 --> 01:47:18,300
And I was expecting maybe,
you know, 700 show up,

1739
01:47:18,330 --> 01:47:19,680
like it should be fine.

1740
01:47:20,250 --> 01:47:23,940
And something like eight or 9,000 showed
up and everyone just kept hitting the

1741
01:47:23,941 --> 01:47:27,960
refresh key. And he has another
fatal error, um, of stupidity.

1742
01:47:27,961 --> 01:47:31,050
And this is not the way our software is
built now because we have professionals

1743
01:47:31,051 --> 01:47:32,340
here. But, uh,

1744
01:47:33,210 --> 01:47:36,060
basically my admin login
was on the very same server.

1745
01:47:37,170 --> 01:47:39,990
Everybody's public access God.

1746
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:44,260
So I couldn't even go into configure it,
you know.

1747
01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:49,400
So the good news is that I couldn't answer
like hundreds of angry emails all at

1748
01:47:49,471 --> 01:47:53,610
once. So I created a Facebook group
for the business, which in 2010,

1749
01:47:53,611 --> 01:47:54,600
not very many people did.

1750
01:47:55,050 --> 01:47:58,920
And so if you go back and screw all
the way down to the beginning of that,

1751
01:47:59,160 --> 01:48:02,430
you'll see me going like, hey, if
everyone could please stop refreshing,

1752
01:48:04,110 --> 01:48:05,310
I can sort this out.

1753
01:48:05,550 --> 01:48:10,260
And what was really cool is that
people felt part of something. Um,

1754
01:48:10,290 --> 01:48:14,760
they felt like, wow, holy shit, this
guy is actually doing this himself. Um,

1755
01:48:14,790 --> 01:48:19,290
we're part of this experiment. Um,
and we're on the inside of it. Um,

1756
01:48:19,350 --> 01:48:22,140
I got a lot of empathy from the customers
even though they were the ones that

1757
01:48:22,141 --> 01:48:27,090
were unable to get what they wanted.
And then when it finally started working,

1758
01:48:27,480 --> 01:48:29,610
I mean,
I literally not showered in five days.

1759
01:48:29,670 --> 01:48:32,610
I had pizza boxes linear and it
looked like a bad movie startup thing.

1760
01:48:33,030 --> 01:48:37,830
I had a beard, like I was, you
know, just strung out manic.

1761
01:48:38,250 --> 01:48:40,950
And I remember I called grant and
it was opening day and he said,

1762
01:48:40,951 --> 01:48:44,160
how many should I prep for? And I
said prep for full, like cause if not,

1763
01:48:44,161 --> 01:48:44,994
we'll turn on the phones.

1764
01:48:45,120 --> 01:48:47,370
But I didn't tell him was that I didn't
order the phones cause I didn't want to

1765
01:48:47,371 --> 01:48:52,200
have a fail safe. You'd burn the ships. I,

1766
01:48:52,201 --> 01:48:56,280
yeah, I, I would, I just wanted to
make sure I, I forced myself to work.

1767
01:48:56,281 --> 01:48:58,950
So we had no phone line.
And um,

1768
01:49:00,480 --> 01:49:04,980
I it, when it started working,
I would double click, you
know, one of the functions,

1769
01:49:04,981 --> 01:49:09,240
it was like a double click on a table.
And if it was yellow,

1770
01:49:09,420 --> 01:49:11,040
it was held,
the public can see it.

1771
01:49:11,070 --> 01:49:13,710
I can make it available up by double
clicking it, who would turn green.

1772
01:49:14,190 --> 01:49:18,060
And then when it was sold, it would turn
red. But the first time I did that, um,

1773
01:49:18,180 --> 01:49:23,070
to act, to let more inventory out,
um, and clearly things were working.

1774
01:49:23,190 --> 01:49:25,080
It turned red so fast.
I thought it was broken.

1775
01:49:26,430 --> 01:49:30,870
And so then I went into the credit
card processing and saw, oh my gosh,

1776
01:49:30,871 --> 01:49:33,810
someone bought that that fast.
And I called grant, I said, dude,

1777
01:49:33,811 --> 01:49:37,830
you got to come to my
house. And he was like, uh,

1778
01:49:37,860 --> 01:49:40,980
we're opening a restaurant and like
six hours, what's going on? I said,

1779
01:49:41,220 --> 01:49:43,780
as the guy who helped save your life,
getting a fucking taxi,

1780
01:49:43,781 --> 01:49:47,320
you can come over here cause I
need to show you something. And

1781
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:52,440
he looked at me and kind of went like,
what is wrong with you? Right. And,

1782
01:49:52,620 --> 01:49:56,660
and I took him upstairs to my office and
I said, I explained what I just to him,

1783
01:49:56,710 --> 01:49:59,680
I just explained to you and I said,
click on one of those, make it available.

1784
01:49:59,770 --> 01:50:02,650
And he said, which one? I
go, anyone in the next month.

1785
01:50:03,790 --> 01:50:07,910
And he clicked like three weeks out at
nine 30 and it instantly turned red and

1786
01:50:08,020 --> 01:50:10,330
another window I had the credit
card thing up and I go, look,

1787
01:50:10,331 --> 01:50:15,070
Mr. Jones bought that. And he
went, really? And I'm like,

1788
01:50:15,100 --> 01:50:19,240
Yep, there are, you know, 4,000 people
waiting for you to do that right now.

1789
01:50:19,750 --> 01:50:23,710
And that was the moment at which I,
I was basically like,

1790
01:50:23,711 --> 01:50:27,930
this is the best thing I've ever built.
Because,

1791
01:50:28,300 --> 01:50:30,010
because it was, it was, it was,

1792
01:50:30,550 --> 01:50:35,550
it was functionally different than
any way that anybody was doing this.

1793
01:50:36,490 --> 01:50:41,230
It wasn't novel. It was just
applied in a novel way. And so,

1794
01:50:41,950 --> 01:50:46,690
you know, what was interesting is that
of course the software itself sucked,

1795
01:50:47,350 --> 01:50:50,770
but as a proof of concept, it was
awesome. Quick question on that.

1796
01:50:50,771 --> 01:50:52,300
If you're comfortable answering how much,

1797
01:50:53,140 --> 01:50:57,340
how much money had you put into
developing the software at that point?

1798
01:50:58,150 --> 01:51:02,440
Roughly, I'm going to
say $115,000. Yeah. Okay.

1799
01:51:03,340 --> 01:51:08,270
In your mind, were you completely
confident it would work or, and there's,

1800
01:51:08,320 --> 01:51:11,320
it doesn't have to be a or B.
There can be CDF or where you,

1801
01:51:11,321 --> 01:51:14,350
like you don't have 415 k
or whatever it might be.

1802
01:51:14,351 --> 01:51:18,800
Even if you budgeted for
less than it overran the,

1803
01:51:19,450 --> 01:51:24,450
even if there is a 20% chance that this
works is it is worth risking the hours

1804
01:51:26,981 --> 01:51:30,160
and time because it will so completely
transformed what we're doing and if it

1805
01:51:30,161 --> 01:51:34,390
fucking fails, who cares? Correct.
Yeah, the latter one. Yeah. Again,

1806
01:51:34,391 --> 01:51:35,980
it's about the asymmetric risk.
Right?

1807
01:51:36,250 --> 01:51:39,940
And it was also about this thing and
that as I dug into how Alinea ran,

1808
01:51:40,570 --> 01:51:45,250
there's like things that you can fix and
control and there's things you can't.

1809
01:51:45,370 --> 01:51:49,870
Right. And this was the one that,
you know, I would answer phones,

1810
01:51:49,871 --> 01:51:53,890
it'll linea. And I would, it
was like being a therapist.

1811
01:51:54,160 --> 01:51:56,080
People would go like, I
would like to, you know,

1812
01:51:56,110 --> 01:51:58,780
make a reservation on my anniversary,
you know,

1813
01:51:58,810 --> 01:52:01,300
seven weeks from now on a Thursday, and
you're like, I'm really sorry. Start.

1814
01:52:01,301 --> 01:52:06,230
It's totally full. And 100% of time they
thought you were lying to them. And,

1815
01:52:07,230 --> 01:52:07,990
and,

1816
01:52:07,990 --> 01:52:12,640
and so consequently I realized that we
were saying no to people more than we

1817
01:52:12,641 --> 01:52:13,570
were saying yes.

1818
01:52:14,170 --> 01:52:19,170
And that even when we said no in a
nice way and took 10 minutes to do so,

1819
01:52:19,840 --> 01:52:20,260
um,

1820
01:52:20,260 --> 01:52:24,910
people thought that we were lying or that
they weren't important to us or any of

1821
01:52:24,911 --> 01:52:25,744
those things.

1822
01:52:26,020 --> 01:52:31,020
And so I felt that transparency was
actually more important than the actual

1823
01:52:32,231 --> 01:52:35,860
money. And at the actual
yield management, I felt like,

1824
01:52:36,070 --> 01:52:40,990
like allowing people to see the entirety
of the inventory was the most important

1825
01:52:40,991 --> 01:52:41,824
thing.

1826
01:52:42,100 --> 01:52:46,970
And I had this re like same
thing with like, you know,

1827
01:52:46,971 --> 01:52:51,550
the trading markets. Um, they've moved to
more and more and more transparency, um,

1828
01:52:51,620 --> 01:52:56,540
more and more speed. This is true across
every industry. And I just felt like,

1829
01:52:56,541 --> 01:52:59,780
wow, this industry I found
myself in was so backwards.

1830
01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:04,430
And so I just wanted to make the
whole thing more transparent.

1831
01:53:04,520 --> 01:53:08,150
And so even if it didn't go
beyond my own restaurants,

1832
01:53:08,210 --> 01:53:09,620
I was totally fine with that.
In fact,

1833
01:53:09,621 --> 01:53:12,690
I didn't do anything with
it for four years. Um,

1834
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:17,800
and I didn't really intend on
making it like a software product.

1835
01:53:18,170 --> 01:53:22,880
I intended on fixing my own problems.
And I think often that's where,

1836
01:53:23,360 --> 01:53:26,410
that's where good ideas come
from. Oh, super often. Yeah.

1837
01:53:26,420 --> 01:53:28,190
The scratching of your own
edge, at least, you know,

1838
01:53:28,191 --> 01:53:31,220
you have a market of one guy's
guaranteed market of one.

1839
01:53:31,221 --> 01:53:33,860
And I also want to point out when we're
talking about asymmetric risk earlier

1840
01:53:33,861 --> 01:53:34,281
and you're like,
well,

1841
01:53:34,281 --> 01:53:38,480
I want to stand to make three
to four x what I stand to lose.

1842
01:53:38,481 --> 01:53:41,840
And if you run the math, and I'm sure
I'm missing a lot of subtleties here,

1843
01:53:41,841 --> 01:53:46,841
but when you said we booked 500 x thousand
dollars and it cost 115 we're getting

1844
01:53:48,020 --> 01:53:51,740
very much within the ballpark of that.
But I didn't even like, I mean, well,

1845
01:53:51,741 --> 01:53:55,730
I mean since then it's like we've taken
our margins at our restaurants from 10

1846
01:53:55,731 --> 01:54:00,410
to 12% to, you know, at times
in good month, 20 to 25%.

1847
01:54:00,900 --> 01:54:05,900
I'm in an industry that
over the last five years,

1848
01:54:06,260 --> 01:54:07,100
if you read,

1849
01:54:07,130 --> 01:54:11,300
I give a talk called Tuesday's not
Saturday and seven things you already know

1850
01:54:11,301 --> 01:54:13,270
but are doing nothing about.
Um,

1851
01:54:13,550 --> 01:54:16,220
it's a talk that I give to the
restaurant industry. And, you know,

1852
01:54:16,221 --> 01:54:20,360
one of the things that,
that I point out in there is that,

1853
01:54:20,990 --> 01:54:21,823
you know,

1854
01:54:22,010 --> 01:54:26,030
there's so many obvious things that
you could be doing to improve your

1855
01:54:26,031 --> 01:54:29,450
hospitality,
to improve your booking process,

1856
01:54:29,480 --> 01:54:31,870
to get rid of food waste.
Um,

1857
01:54:32,300 --> 01:54:35,510
but people tend to just kind of move
along because it's a really chaotic

1858
01:54:35,511 --> 01:54:39,170
environment. It's hard to make change
in it because every day is game day.

1859
01:54:39,200 --> 01:54:41,750
Like you wake up every day and a hundred
people are going to come through the

1860
01:54:41,751 --> 01:54:43,520
door and if your
fishmonger doesn't show up,

1861
01:54:43,521 --> 01:54:48,200
all you need to figure out what to
do with that, you know? And so it's,

1862
01:54:48,410 --> 01:54:53,410
it's not really about the return on
that one investment at that one moment.

1863
01:54:53,990 --> 01:54:58,070
It's more like, you know, a thousand
small improvements over time.

1864
01:54:58,430 --> 01:54:59,520
And you know,
what,

1865
01:54:59,600 --> 01:55:04,280
if I look back at that system that I built
then compared to what we have now, um,

1866
01:55:04,310 --> 01:55:08,510
you know, it's a minuscule part
of what it turned into. Um,

1867
01:55:08,630 --> 01:55:13,070
but it was the seed of an idea,
which is more important, which is,

1868
01:55:13,550 --> 01:55:16,630
hey, let's, let's shake
things up. And then I,

1869
01:55:16,631 --> 01:55:20,420
I got a great CFO who was
at Bain consulting and he,

1870
01:55:20,660 --> 01:55:24,500
he came on to like help manage the
building of the project of next. Um,

1871
01:55:25,010 --> 01:55:28,400
and when he started wanting to build
out a business team, I was like, great,

1872
01:55:28,550 --> 01:55:30,020
like run with it.

1873
01:55:30,080 --> 01:55:34,610
And so we've built out food cost
analysis that uses Marimekko charts.

1874
01:55:34,760 --> 01:55:38,240
It's totally different because it's
visual and you give that to the chef uses

1875
01:55:38,241 --> 01:55:41,130
what shirts. Ah, Marimekko uh, if you,

1876
01:55:41,300 --> 01:55:43,590
if you don't know Marimekko if
you get nothing out of this,

1877
01:55:43,890 --> 01:55:48,240
one of the greatest visualizations,
um, in, in charts that
you could like, you know,

1878
01:55:48,270 --> 01:55:52,810
do an excel or whatever,
um, hard to do vocally. Um,

1879
01:55:53,010 --> 01:55:55,890
but imagine a square where each,
um,

1880
01:55:56,310 --> 01:56:00,180
of your x axis is the percentage
of let's say food costs.

1881
01:56:00,660 --> 01:56:04,980
And then, um, each square within
there is like, I don't know,

1882
01:56:05,490 --> 01:56:08,460
meat or produce,
but the whole of the square is 100%.

1883
01:56:09,330 --> 01:56:14,280
The y access is 100% of one metric
and the x axis is 100% of another.

1884
01:56:14,670 --> 01:56:18,510
So you could kind of look at any given
square and see how much that impacts the

1885
01:56:18,511 --> 01:56:22,620
whole, it becomes like a big lego
building with different colors.

1886
01:56:23,220 --> 01:56:23,790
Um,

1887
01:56:23,790 --> 01:56:28,560
if you give a busy chef
400 receipts and say, Hey,

1888
01:56:28,561 --> 01:56:32,280
every Friday looked through
all these and you know,

1889
01:56:32,281 --> 01:56:36,070
figure out what we're spending
too much on or worse, Hey,

1890
01:56:36,090 --> 01:56:40,020
your food costs last month for
36%, I need him at 32%. Um,

1891
01:56:40,050 --> 01:56:42,780
you can't take percentages to the bank.
Let's talk about dollars.

1892
01:56:42,870 --> 01:56:46,140
Let's see where we can say some
dollars. Um, or the revenue.

1893
01:56:46,141 --> 01:56:48,000
You could have just gone down
that month for whatever reasons,

1894
01:56:48,001 --> 01:56:51,870
August in New York. And so as, it's
not really a good way to look at it,

1895
01:56:51,900 --> 01:56:54,710
but you give this
person, this, this chart,

1896
01:56:54,720 --> 01:56:58,140
this mere Meco know Marimekko his name,

1897
01:56:58,710 --> 01:57:03,470
m a r I m e k k o chart. Is
that right? Again, not good.

1898
01:57:04,490 --> 01:57:05,940
I think so there is a Google result,

1899
01:57:05,941 --> 01:57:08,190
which is how to make a
Marimekko chart in excel.

1900
01:57:08,191 --> 01:57:11,640
So I'm guessing that's probably it.
There's medicine, youtube videos as well.

1901
01:57:11,641 --> 01:57:15,240
So I'll, I'll put this in the show notes
for people. Man, I got to tell you,

1902
01:57:15,270 --> 01:57:17,820
like from a utility perspective,

1903
01:57:19,260 --> 01:57:23,040
you show that to a person, you explain
it visually, like when you see it,

1904
01:57:23,041 --> 01:57:23,970
it makes much more sense.

1905
01:57:24,840 --> 01:57:27,180
And they instantly get it and they
look at it and they're like, oh,

1906
01:57:27,181 --> 01:57:31,110
there's no way I spent that much on facial
last month. You know, and this can be,

1907
01:57:31,170 --> 01:57:35,730
this can be used for things outside. Okay.
Everything. Yeah. It's not just food,

1908
01:57:35,731 --> 01:57:37,780
not just restaurants.
Oh, no, no, no. It's,

1909
01:57:37,790 --> 01:57:42,790
it's just a great visualization
of utility and they're like,

1910
01:57:42,870 --> 01:57:46,230
consultants love it. And I got to tell
you, I don't love consultants in general,

1911
01:57:46,810 --> 01:57:49,020
but, but, but if I've
learned anything from,

1912
01:57:49,050 --> 01:57:51,450
from the best consultant
that I've ever hired,

1913
01:57:51,451 --> 01:57:55,470
like who is now my partner
and CFO, um, he, you know,

1914
01:57:55,500 --> 01:57:57,630
he came up with this and as
soon as I saw it, I was like,

1915
01:57:57,631 --> 01:58:02,190
how did this not enter my life until
my 40th year? This makes no sense.

1916
01:58:02,191 --> 01:58:06,510
You know? Um, it's just incredibly
useful. But my point is, is that we,

1917
01:58:06,770 --> 01:58:09,000
we kind of went through everything in
the restaurant and went like, well,

1918
01:58:09,001 --> 01:58:13,290
what are the biggest spending areas
that we can like analyze? And, um,

1919
01:58:13,560 --> 01:58:16,920
it's true in any endeavor
that you're doing, you know,

1920
01:58:16,921 --> 01:58:17,910
there's no point in looking at,

1921
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:22,770
at the dimes if you've got something
that costs $1,000, start there. So,

1922
01:58:22,800 --> 01:58:25,860
um, you know, and that's, you know,

1923
01:58:25,890 --> 01:58:30,840
getting into like our thoughts
on our publicity or PR.

1924
01:58:30,930 --> 01:58:35,930
Like we don't have a professional PR
person and haven't in 14 and a half years.

1925
01:58:37,620 --> 01:58:38,970
Um,
we,

1926
01:58:40,080 --> 01:58:43,780
we don't spend money on any
promotions other than social media.

1927
01:58:44,680 --> 01:58:49,060
Um, and then with the social media,
we track all of that, you know, um,

1928
01:58:49,090 --> 01:58:52,570
we can see what our Roi
is on a boosted post. Um,

1929
01:58:52,660 --> 01:58:56,250
we can see what our ROI is if we
advertise on your podcast. And you know,

1930
01:58:56,260 --> 01:59:00,460
those are, that's, that's why
these mediums are working,

1931
01:59:00,700 --> 01:59:04,890
um, is because there are
measurable, you know, I,

1932
01:59:05,290 --> 01:59:10,290
I was looking up just as you were
chatting and as I was also looking for a

1933
01:59:10,301 --> 01:59:11,134
Marimekko,

1934
01:59:12,040 --> 01:59:17,040
a quote that I think applies and you
may certainly feel free to disagree but

1935
01:59:17,560 --> 01:59:22,560
applies very well to a lot
of the breakthroughs that,

1936
01:59:23,530 --> 01:59:28,530
that you have experienced and also help
to catalyze in a lot of what you've

1937
01:59:29,801 --> 01:59:32,830
done. And it's quote from Charlie
Munger who for those who don't know,

1938
01:59:33,430 --> 01:59:36,180
you should definitely take a look at
poor Charlie's Almanack. He's the,

1939
01:59:36,380 --> 01:59:40,660
the the right hand or I shouldn't even
say that he is the investing partner of

1940
01:59:40,720 --> 01:59:45,440
Warren Buffet and a fascinating,
fascinating human being. But one of,

1941
01:59:45,460 --> 01:59:50,410
one of the quotes of his that I really
returned to a lot when I think I might be

1942
01:59:50,411 --> 01:59:55,270
outsmarting myself in some way, uh,
or in general as a reminder is quote,

1943
01:59:55,271 --> 01:59:59,260
it is remarkable how much long term
advantage people like us have gotten by

1944
01:59:59,380 --> 02:00:03,280
trying to be consistently not stupid
instead of trying to be very intelligent.

1945
02:00:04,850 --> 02:00:09,280
Yeah. Because you, you've,
as you noted earlier,

1946
02:00:09,281 --> 02:00:14,281
you have these practices that are
being implemented by otherwise,

1947
02:00:16,450 --> 02:00:19,900
in many cases, smart people who've
just not taken the time to ask,

1948
02:00:19,901 --> 02:00:24,450
why are we doing this? Why does
this exist as a thing? Why would,

1949
02:00:24,451 --> 02:00:26,830
why does, like you pointed out, it's so

1950
02:00:28,900 --> 02:00:30,340
obvious once you reframe it,

1951
02:00:30,341 --> 02:00:33,220
like you walk into a clothing
store and they're like, okay,

1952
02:00:33,221 --> 02:00:35,350
what are you looking for him? Nope.
Sorry, it gets again. It's like,

1953
02:00:35,351 --> 02:00:36,760
that's fucking ridiculous.
Right?

1954
02:00:37,030 --> 02:00:41,590
And yet that's exactly the way it
works in many other places. Yeah. Yeah.

1955
02:00:41,670 --> 02:00:43,790
And that's it.

1956
02:00:43,840 --> 02:00:47,320
Once you start down that
road of thinking that way,

1957
02:00:47,620 --> 02:00:51,050
it will drive you a little
nutty because you stuck.

1958
02:00:51,110 --> 02:00:55,870
Like you can't do every business,
you know? And um, you know,

1959
02:00:55,871 --> 02:00:59,200
there's a couple things that I've got
my back pocket that I'm kind of like,

1960
02:00:59,201 --> 02:00:59,531
you know,

1961
02:00:59,531 --> 02:01:04,180
one day I'm going to arbitrage truffles
because it's like there's an opaque

1962
02:01:04,181 --> 02:01:08,170
market that's absurd. Like, you know,
it's like there, here's an example,

1963
02:01:08,171 --> 02:01:09,340
I'm gonna give somebody out there,

1964
02:01:09,460 --> 02:01:12,600
call me up because this is
a real business idea. Um,

1965
02:01:12,880 --> 02:01:16,000
and I've been wanting to do it for years,
but you know, black and white truffles,

1966
02:01:16,030 --> 02:01:17,410
not the kind,
not the chocolate ones,

1967
02:01:17,411 --> 02:01:22,060
but the kind that the dogs dig up in
France and Italy are as expensive as the

1968
02:01:22,061 --> 02:01:24,390
most expensive drugs in the world.
Um,

1969
02:01:24,460 --> 02:01:28,390
you order them is if it were an illegal
drug, of course they're perfectly legal,

1970
02:01:28,690 --> 02:01:33,070
but you call it a truffle dealer.
Um, and you go like, you know,

1971
02:01:33,100 --> 02:01:34,750
what do they cost while they're,
you know,

1972
02:01:35,470 --> 02:01:39,950
650 a pound right now for black truffles,
16 for White.

1973
02:01:40,370 --> 02:01:41,780
You'd try to talk them down a little bit.

1974
02:01:41,900 --> 02:01:44,000
You make sure that you get
the best quality because hey,

1975
02:01:44,001 --> 02:01:47,150
we're Alinea and we will ship you back.
This stuff we don't like and all that.

1976
02:01:47,510 --> 02:01:52,510
And then in an unmarked box stacked
with newspaper will come $20,000 of

1977
02:01:52,641 --> 02:01:55,910
truffles. Good for like
a week by the way. Like,

1978
02:01:55,911 --> 02:02:00,911
not like this is not like a big supply
and is completely opaque as a market.

1979
02:02:03,980 --> 02:02:08,000
Um, there is no mycologists
touching these. Um,

1980
02:02:08,060 --> 02:02:10,700
there are knock offs from Minot,
not knock outs.

1981
02:02:10,701 --> 02:02:15,200
There's different species and quality
from Australia, from Tennessee, from,

1982
02:02:15,440 --> 02:02:18,020
from China, um, etc. Etc.

1983
02:02:18,230 --> 02:02:22,910
That they cut into it
so familiar. Um, and,

1984
02:02:22,970 --> 02:02:27,890
and like it was my, like we spend a
lot of money on truffles every year,

1985
02:02:28,280 --> 02:02:29,090
um,

1986
02:02:29,090 --> 02:02:34,070
and try to figure out what the u s market
in the fall truffle season is worth.

1987
02:02:34,430 --> 02:02:39,380
You can't, it's exactly like publishing.
You can't find numbers, you know,

1988
02:02:39,530 --> 02:02:44,120
and so whenever I, whenever I see
something like that, I'm like,

1989
02:02:44,121 --> 02:02:49,070
someone's guarding their, their
golden goose, you know, that whatever,

1990
02:02:49,280 --> 02:02:50,840
whenever it's a black box,
you're like,

1991
02:02:50,841 --> 02:02:55,000
I feel like I am not on the best side of
this trade. That's right. That's right.

1992
02:02:55,610 --> 02:02:59,000
And that's what I did.
Um, you know, I did, um,

1993
02:02:59,060 --> 02:03:03,560
a closing insular network between the
merch and the Amex to arbitrage ETFs to

1994
02:03:03,561 --> 02:03:05,570
get rid of the phone
brokers in the middle.

1995
02:03:06,410 --> 02:03:10,950
That took me like a year and a half
to get through the murk and Amex,

1996
02:03:11,030 --> 02:03:15,470
um, powers that be, um,
red, like most of the CFTC.

1997
02:03:15,471 --> 02:03:19,220
So when they would tell me it's not
like in the rules or not legal or notice

1998
02:03:19,250 --> 02:03:23,170
this CFTC Chicago trade, which is the, uh,

1999
02:03:23,210 --> 02:03:27,110
the federal commodities trading
commission. I see. Okay.

2000
02:03:27,290 --> 02:03:32,240
It's like the sec, but for commodities.
I gotcha. Um, and you know, again,

2001
02:03:32,270 --> 02:03:33,710
sit down and actually read that someday.

2002
02:03:34,130 --> 02:03:36,470
Like what's amazing is that the
experts and never, it's like,

2003
02:03:36,590 --> 02:03:39,380
it's like the members of Congress who
don't read the bill and then if you ask

2004
02:03:39,381 --> 02:03:41,930
them detailed instructions on it, they're
like, oh yeah, I don't really know,

2005
02:03:41,931 --> 02:03:44,720
but the general tenor is this or that.
Um,

2006
02:03:44,750 --> 02:03:48,380
the people who were governing the
exchanges had never read the rules,

2007
02:03:48,440 --> 02:03:51,510
so they would just quote to me, they
would just quote to me like, you're not,

2008
02:03:51,520 --> 02:03:52,790
it's against the rules.
And I'd be like, well,

2009
02:03:52,791 --> 02:03:56,240
here are the seven volumes police show
me where if not, I'm going to do it.

2010
02:03:56,270 --> 02:04:00,860
You know? Um, and so
similarly, like truffles,

2011
02:04:00,861 --> 02:04:05,840
same thing. Um, the, the, you know, the
booking for the restaurant, same thing.

2012
02:04:05,900 --> 02:04:08,990
Open table had a monopoly. They wouldn't
tell you who your customers were.

2013
02:04:09,020 --> 02:04:12,400
They would sell your customers. They
still do. To other restaurants. If you,

2014
02:04:12,650 --> 02:04:13,483
if you're full one night,

2015
02:04:13,490 --> 02:04:15,860
they'll just send you down the street to
a Japanese restaurant down the street.

2016
02:04:15,920 --> 02:04:18,620
They don't care.
So I wanted to get rid of all that.

2017
02:04:18,650 --> 02:04:20,630
So I built the software for that.
Truffles,

2018
02:04:20,631 --> 02:04:25,620
I will someday build a truffle exchange.
So question for you. This is, this is, uh,

2019
02:04:25,670 --> 02:04:27,620
this is something also for,

2020
02:04:27,650 --> 02:04:30,950
this is maybe just turning this into a
therapy session slash coaching sessions

2021
02:04:31,260 --> 02:04:31,881
for myself,

2022
02:04:31,881 --> 02:04:36,881
but I get attracted like a
moth to the flame to puzzles

2023
02:04:38,400 --> 02:04:42,270
and I've got a puzzle. No, no, no. I
don't need any more thoughts on this.

2024
02:04:42,330 --> 02:04:45,960
I need to do more puzzles.
But you, there are many,

2025
02:04:45,990 --> 02:04:49,830
many black boxes out there,
right? You have, you have
truffles. And like you said,

2026
02:04:49,831 --> 02:04:50,191
it's like,
all right,

2027
02:04:50,191 --> 02:04:55,191
what's the market size of the
truffle exchange at x point in time?

2028
02:04:57,240 --> 02:05:00,690
Don't know. Right? Uh,
although you guys, uh,

2029
02:05:00,691 --> 02:05:03,510
as one establishment or
multiple sessions by a lot,

2030
02:05:04,770 --> 02:05:09,720
there might be a hundred different
black boxes like that that you run into.

2031
02:05:09,990 --> 02:05:14,990
How do you choose the black boxes
worth trying to shine light on like a

2032
02:05:16,231 --> 02:05:19,470
detective? Because it's going to consume
energy, it's going to consume time.

2033
02:05:19,860 --> 02:05:21,810
How do you pick and
choose which to go after?

2034
02:05:23,580 --> 02:05:26,410
It's, it's, it's, it's
like the manic test, right?

2035
02:05:26,411 --> 02:05:29,020
Like it's like the one
that bothers me the most,

2036
02:05:30,490 --> 02:05:34,060
like I kind of start doing, you
know, um, and then, uh, you know,

2037
02:05:34,061 --> 02:05:35,380
and then it's iterative from there.

2038
02:05:35,410 --> 02:05:39,820
Like sometimes you find yourself in a
construction of your own doing that was

2039
02:05:39,821 --> 02:05:43,090
accidental. Like all
of a sudden, you know,

2040
02:05:43,120 --> 02:05:46,360
you kind of opened your mouth and said
something like the truffle thing and all

2041
02:05:46,361 --> 02:05:48,940
of a sudden like, well, okay, I guess
we're building the truffle exchange.

2042
02:05:49,980 --> 02:05:54,700
I feel like the boring company
is like that from us. Like, like,

2043
02:05:54,730 --> 02:05:58,110
like he opened his mouth and be
like, yeah, just big, big, you know,

2044
02:05:58,120 --> 02:06:02,400
dig big tunnels and he's got enough
credibility now where some engineer's went

2045
02:06:02,410 --> 02:06:04,000
like, yeah, we could build, you know,

2046
02:06:04,340 --> 02:06:08,890
we can dig tunnels that are seismically
fine and like, hey, you work for space X.

2047
02:06:08,890 --> 02:06:10,870
Okay. Like, let's see if you
can build a dig a tunnel.

2048
02:06:11,470 --> 02:06:15,060
I don't think that was like a
business plan, you know? And,

2049
02:06:15,110 --> 02:06:19,350
and he just has a lot of credibility.
Um, you know, at this point, um,

2050
02:06:19,420 --> 02:06:23,860
I think that to a certain extent,
like a lot of people have a lot of ideas,

2051
02:06:23,861 --> 02:06:28,510
they just don't dig down
that rabbit hole. And, um,

2052
02:06:28,570 --> 02:06:32,960
so, you know, I, I do
some as like a hobby. Um,

2053
02:06:32,980 --> 02:06:36,700
I do somewhere, I kind of have someone
that I like within our company and say,

2054
02:06:36,701 --> 02:06:41,230
well, if you really wanted to be
independent and do something cool, like,

2055
02:06:41,350 --> 02:06:45,400
here's a project, like learn more about
this and start researching it. You know,

2056
02:06:45,640 --> 02:06:46,670
we have,
you know,

2057
02:06:46,990 --> 02:06:51,180
300 and some employees on the restaurant
side and about 50 on talk. Um,

2058
02:06:51,220 --> 02:06:54,880
many of them are incredibly hardworking
and intelligent. And when someone says,

2059
02:06:54,881 --> 02:06:56,560
Hey, I want to learn how
to be more entrepreneurial,

2060
02:06:56,830 --> 02:06:59,950
I take one of my black boxes out and
say, well, let's see if that's true

2061
02:07:02,110 --> 02:07:05,800
because it's going to take you six
months of independent work without any

2062
02:07:05,801 --> 02:07:08,650
guidance and you're going to
get tired of it really fast.

2063
02:07:08,920 --> 02:07:11,400
Or we're going to come back to me
and say, Hey, you know what? Like,

2064
02:07:11,500 --> 02:07:16,090
I can't figure out the total value of
the truffle market in the United States.

2065
02:07:16,360 --> 02:07:18,190
And I'm like, yeah, no shit.
That's why I asked you to do it.

2066
02:07:19,220 --> 02:07:22,160
Now, would you give them an assignment
like this? Or like, you know what boss,

2067
02:07:22,161 --> 02:07:25,070
I really want to be an entrepreneur.
You're like, congratulations.

2068
02:07:25,170 --> 02:07:28,760
I'm now giving you a project and a,

2069
02:07:29,240 --> 02:07:31,400
it's on your time and you're
not getting paid for it.

2070
02:07:31,730 --> 02:07:36,040
Oh, no, no, no. It's not. No, no, no, no.
I, I never, never, never take every single

2071
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:39,250
intern that works at our restaurants
for a minute is paid. Gotcha.

2072
02:07:39,340 --> 02:07:43,720
So even if you get paid for the black
box time, oh yeah, of course. Yeah. Yeah.

2073
02:07:43,750 --> 02:07:44,890
I would never,
like,

2074
02:07:44,891 --> 02:07:48,610
I think one of the things that I
really dislike actually our industries,

2075
02:07:48,670 --> 02:07:53,290
like where they say, hey, like you're,
you know, you're in college or whatever,

2076
02:07:53,680 --> 02:07:57,490
you know, be an intern and then,
you know, your parents say, yeah,

2077
02:07:57,491 --> 02:07:59,710
that's a great opportunity for you
to learn something and all that.

2078
02:08:00,040 --> 02:08:01,990
And it's like, well, you're probably
not, if you're not getting paid,

2079
02:08:01,991 --> 02:08:06,370
you're not being valued,
frankly. And, um, for me, I, we,

2080
02:08:06,390 --> 02:08:10,830
we pay everybody. Like I don't
nobody who's working here. Um,

2081
02:08:11,300 --> 02:08:13,720
I, I do expect that, you know,

2082
02:08:13,721 --> 02:08:18,550
salaried people are going to work
more than just the time here.

2083
02:08:18,640 --> 02:08:22,990
And I think that people who
are passionately curious
will be given a problem

2084
02:08:22,991 --> 02:08:27,991
like that and we'll come up
with interesting solutions
to finding out what the

2085
02:08:28,211 --> 02:08:31,210
answer may be and that that's enough.
You know.

2086
02:08:32,020 --> 02:08:35,800
So I want to add some sort of
commentary on the question that I asked,

2087
02:08:35,801 --> 02:08:36,980
which is a,

2088
02:08:37,340 --> 02:08:41,650
I think it's incredible that you do
pay them for that independent research,

2089
02:08:41,770 --> 02:08:46,450
which is also acting as entrepreneurial
training slash filtering for them.

2090
02:08:46,600 --> 02:08:49,660
Uh, but I wouldn't have judged
too harshly at all if you said no,

2091
02:08:49,661 --> 02:08:50,620
that's on their own time.

2092
02:08:50,621 --> 02:08:55,621
And the reason I say that is that if
you are going to be investigating black

2093
02:08:55,961 --> 02:08:56,980
boxes as an entrepreneur,

2094
02:08:56,981 --> 02:09:00,460
there are going to be periods of time
where you are doing it in the evenings.

2095
02:09:00,461 --> 02:09:01,780
You were doing it on the weekends.

2096
02:09:01,810 --> 02:09:06,760
You are doing it without a clear
road to immediate cash flow. Right.

2097
02:09:06,761 --> 02:09:08,530
So I wouldn't have judged you if you said,
you know what,

2098
02:09:08,531 --> 02:09:11,020
I am paying them full
time for their normal job,

2099
02:09:11,021 --> 02:09:13,300
but if they want to tackle
one of these black boxes,

2100
02:09:13,990 --> 02:09:16,800
that's considered extracurricular time.
Uh,

2101
02:09:16,840 --> 02:09:21,130
so I wouldn't have judged too harshly
if you had respond in the, uh,

2102
02:09:21,131 --> 02:09:24,600
in the negative on that. Yeah. I
mean, I guess, I guess, you know, to,

2103
02:09:24,601 --> 02:09:28,120
to back up a little bit, like when
there are people who I don't know,

2104
02:09:28,690 --> 02:09:31,870
who do not work for our company,
and they called me up and say, Hey,

2105
02:09:31,871 --> 02:09:35,740
I've got this idea for x, y, Z or
whatever. And it's intriguing enough,

2106
02:09:36,430 --> 02:09:40,000
I will,
I will pose some more difficult questions,

2107
02:09:40,420 --> 02:09:43,070
but they're not working for me.
You know what I mean? Like there's,

2108
02:09:43,090 --> 02:09:46,120
there's a guy who brought me a
food product that I, you know, uh,

2109
02:09:46,121 --> 02:09:51,121
about a year ago and it was
interesting but not super compelling.

2110
02:09:52,660 --> 02:09:55,030
And I said, hey, if you
did these five things,

2111
02:09:55,420 --> 02:09:58,720
it would be a lot more compelling for me
to be involved and to help with it and

2112
02:09:58,721 --> 02:09:59,554
all of that.

2113
02:09:59,620 --> 02:10:04,620
And yesterday I got a box in the mail and
he had done not only the five things I

2114
02:10:04,871 --> 02:10:08,380
said, but said, hey, when I started doing
those, these seven other things popped up.

2115
02:10:08,620 --> 02:10:11,290
Here's where the product is,
here's the people we signed,

2116
02:10:11,320 --> 02:10:14,890
here's the airline we just
signed to carry the product.

2117
02:10:14,950 --> 02:10:17,260
And I would love to
have you still involved,

2118
02:10:17,290 --> 02:10:20,500
even though we're so much farther down
the road than I thought it'd be a year

2119
02:10:20,500 --> 02:10:23,350
later. That's super cool.
Like, Hey, that guy obviously,

2120
02:10:23,470 --> 02:10:26,470
but there's a person who's
truly entrepreneurial, right?

2121
02:10:26,471 --> 02:10:29,530
And did this on his own time.
Um, but if they're working here,

2122
02:10:29,531 --> 02:10:32,740
if they worked for the ALINEA group, if
they work for talk, like for sure there,

2123
02:10:32,770 --> 02:10:36,440
you know, you could take time during your
day, like doing your normal business.

2124
02:10:36,441 --> 02:10:40,180
That's a project that we're
working on. And, um, you know, we,

2125
02:10:40,181 --> 02:10:44,330
we also try not to have such harshly
defined rules and that within the

2126
02:10:44,331 --> 02:10:46,700
restaurant, like, look, if you're
a server, if you're a captain,

2127
02:10:46,701 --> 02:10:50,960
if you're a aligned cook,
um, you're probably not
working on my truffle project.

2128
02:10:53,840 --> 02:10:58,820
I mean realistically, you know, that's
not, but on the business side, um,

2129
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:03,330
we certainly have, um, people
who, who work in roles, um,

2130
02:11:03,380 --> 02:11:08,380
as like a lawyer or an
analyst or something like
that who want to get involved

2131
02:11:08,751 --> 02:11:12,200
with our publishing project or who want
to get involved with the truffle project

2132
02:11:12,230 --> 02:11:14,750
or whatever it may be.
And you know,

2133
02:11:14,751 --> 02:11:19,160
I'm happy to pull them in and try to
include them. And you know, like you said,

2134
02:11:19,200 --> 02:11:23,210
you used the word as an
entrepreneurial filter. Um,

2135
02:11:23,480 --> 02:11:27,650
I would say 95% of the time people
filter themselves up. Right?

2136
02:11:28,550 --> 02:11:31,220
Yeah, I agree with that. I mean, they're
going to sell self, select your self,

2137
02:11:31,221 --> 02:11:33,870
select out. Yeah. Uh,

2138
02:11:34,430 --> 02:11:39,430
are there any particular
books or resources that you've
found useful on a hiring

2139
02:11:40,371 --> 02:11:43,760
or managing God if you found one?
Let me know.

2140
02:11:45,230 --> 02:11:50,000
Now. Hiring is so hard. I think it's
the hardest of all things to do.

2141
02:11:50,150 --> 02:11:50,930
Um,

2142
02:11:50,930 --> 02:11:55,930
and I think my style of interviewing
people is totally different than it was 20

2143
02:11:56,841 --> 02:11:58,520
years ago.
Um,

2144
02:11:58,880 --> 02:12:03,380
we use the word self selecting just a
moment ago and it's exactly what I do.

2145
02:12:03,650 --> 02:12:06,890
I kind of bring people in,
I let them know what I'm about,

2146
02:12:06,920 --> 02:12:08,150
what the company's about.

2147
02:12:08,480 --> 02:12:13,250
They've probably already been
interviewed by other people before they,

2148
02:12:13,400 --> 02:12:14,233
they get to me.

2149
02:12:14,870 --> 02:12:18,710
And so at that point I let them know like
what are the upsides and downsides of

2150
02:12:18,711 --> 02:12:23,330
working here, you know, and I kind of
let them know what the expectations are.

2151
02:12:23,810 --> 02:12:25,280
And I,
I tell them like,

2152
02:12:25,340 --> 02:12:29,060
people self select into a job and you
don't want to come here if you're going to

2153
02:12:29,061 --> 02:12:32,750
fail because that would be terrible and
I don't want you to come here and fail

2154
02:12:33,070 --> 02:12:36,980
because that would be a waste of my time
and resources and would also feel awful.

2155
02:12:37,010 --> 02:12:41,720
It's never good to like go if
someone feels terrible. So let's see.

2156
02:12:41,721 --> 02:12:44,120
If you are self selecting in,
what do you want to know?

2157
02:12:44,570 --> 02:12:48,380
Like I'll be completely transparent
about what's good, what's bad,

2158
02:12:48,470 --> 02:12:50,360
what's good about working
for me personally,

2159
02:12:51,230 --> 02:12:54,690
the fact that you maybe you'll
never see me again. I mean this,

2160
02:12:54,790 --> 02:12:57,080
it's like a big enough organization where,
you know,

2161
02:12:57,081 --> 02:13:01,790
there are definitely people working here
who, who I don't know at all. Um, but

2162
02:13:03,620 --> 02:13:08,360
people tend to join organizations
where they want to work.

2163
02:13:09,110 --> 02:13:11,750
And so I tried to make that process.

2164
02:13:11,780 --> 02:13:16,780
I tried to make them be able to say
no easier than they can say yes.

2165
02:13:17,680 --> 02:13:21,200
What would be some examples
of how you do that? You know,

2166
02:13:22,850 --> 02:13:27,530
I kind of judge the person by
what they're pain points are.

2167
02:13:28,010 --> 02:13:32,120
And so if someone says like, you know,
one of the things like to ask, you know,

2168
02:13:32,130 --> 02:13:35,670
which it kind of resonates probably
with, with you as I say, hey,

2169
02:13:35,671 --> 02:13:40,080
we're less five books he read.
And I gotta tell you,

2170
02:13:40,110 --> 02:13:42,960
that's a really hard question to answer.
Um,

2171
02:13:43,050 --> 02:13:46,260
because even if you're a voracious reader,
it's really like,

2172
02:13:46,261 --> 02:13:47,850
you remember like a
book from two years ago,

2173
02:13:47,851 --> 02:13:50,460
but you can't remember the one you
read two months ago sometimes. Totally.

2174
02:13:50,730 --> 02:13:52,140
At least I can't,
you know.

2175
02:13:52,440 --> 02:13:56,640
And so that is a great filter on people
because a couple of things will happen.

2176
02:13:56,670 --> 02:14:00,060
One, the person who is a veracious reader
will go like, oh my God, I swear to God,

2177
02:14:00,120 --> 02:14:03,600
I read like 20 bucks this year. Um, let's
see. And then we'll really start going,

2178
02:14:03,630 --> 02:14:06,540
oh, well I read one like three months
ago that was this. And it was about that.

2179
02:14:06,720 --> 02:14:11,280
And you can tell that
they're intellectually
curious and, and read a lot.

2180
02:14:11,630 --> 02:14:14,880
Um, you'll also get a person who goes,
look, I haven't read a book in 20 years,

2181
02:14:14,940 --> 02:14:19,940
but every night I go home and I do
woodworking and that's my outlet.

2182
02:14:21,360 --> 02:14:23,490
That's where I focus,
that's my zen moment.

2183
02:14:23,790 --> 02:14:26,550
And that's a valid answer to
that question too. You know,

2184
02:14:26,580 --> 02:14:30,360
like you don't have to be a reader. Some
people will just lie through their teeth

2185
02:14:32,760 --> 02:14:36,480
and they'll, they'll answer
what they think is the smart
answer to that question.

2186
02:14:37,020 --> 02:14:38,670
And I don't want that person there.

2187
02:14:38,900 --> 02:14:42,420
I read war and peace and then I went to
the problems of philosophy and uh, yes,

2188
02:14:42,421 --> 02:14:47,400
yes, yes. The four hour work week.
So definitely not the right answer.

2189
02:14:48,500 --> 02:14:51,510
So, so, um, so there's that and
I asked that kind of question,

2190
02:14:51,690 --> 02:14:56,550
but then like things like, do you
enjoy writing? Like, I like one of my,

2191
02:14:56,580 --> 02:14:59,780
like one of my things is like, if someone
doesn't like to write, what do we,

2192
02:14:59,850 --> 02:15:03,650
when people ask what I do for a living,
I say I'm a writer. And they go like, Oh,

2193
02:15:03,660 --> 02:15:06,600
you've written a couple books. And I go,
no, no, no. I read about 400 emails a day.

2194
02:15:07,740 --> 02:15:12,210
And that skill is hugely important right
now. If someone doesn't like to write,

2195
02:15:12,240 --> 02:15:15,090
they're not gonna want to
work for me because when,

2196
02:15:15,660 --> 02:15:20,660
when they send out an email and I cc'd
on it and it isn't a well thought out

2197
02:15:21,900 --> 02:15:25,980
little thing, the answer
coming back is like, hey,

2198
02:15:25,981 --> 02:15:28,620
here's four ways to improve this.
Um,

2199
02:15:28,950 --> 02:15:32,670
and at some point it will be like,
really,

2200
02:15:32,700 --> 02:15:37,260
you did that same mistake again?
Like it comes off kind of harsh and email,

2201
02:15:37,290 --> 02:15:38,430
you know?
Um,

2202
02:15:38,760 --> 02:15:41,490
and so if you're the kind of person that
doesn't take feedback well or doesn't

2203
02:15:41,491 --> 02:15:44,190
want to learn, like, man, I don't, I,

2204
02:15:44,200 --> 02:15:47,640
I'm lacking patients for that
at this point in my life. Um,

2205
02:15:47,700 --> 02:15:50,760
and I let them know that. And some people
like look at and you can just go like,

2206
02:15:50,761 --> 02:15:53,670
yeah dude, I don't want to work
there. Like more than I would think,

2207
02:15:53,850 --> 02:15:56,490
which is great.
You know,

2208
02:15:56,520 --> 02:16:01,430
simplifies matters and it's not, it's
not, it's done with a smile. You know,

2209
02:16:01,440 --> 02:16:05,430
I'm not like trying to like terrorize
people and they come in and interview and

2210
02:16:05,431 --> 02:16:09,470
then there's some people
that go like, awesome, that's
exactly what I want. And um,

2211
02:16:09,540 --> 02:16:11,400
you know, we've everything
from like, you know,

2212
02:16:11,640 --> 02:16:15,020
double phd engineers to um,

2213
02:16:15,060 --> 02:16:19,950
people who've never attended a
university for a minute and um,

2214
02:16:20,040 --> 02:16:24,000
but they've, they've self selected
into an organization that, um,

2215
02:16:24,450 --> 02:16:27,030
people ask a lot of questions.
I love that.

2216
02:16:27,060 --> 02:16:31,600
Like I can be in room and of the idea and
everyone there, I'll just be like, well,

2217
02:16:31,601 --> 02:16:32,560
that's a great idea.

2218
02:16:32,561 --> 02:16:35,830
There's no way we're going to be able to
do that next six months because that's

2219
02:16:35,831 --> 02:16:37,360
not,
that's not in our,

2220
02:16:38,170 --> 02:16:41,110
it's not in our capacity
at our size right now.

2221
02:16:41,590 --> 02:16:46,590
I think a question on a lot of people's
minds and a pain point for most people

2222
02:16:46,901 --> 02:16:48,250
listening will be email.

2223
02:16:48,340 --> 02:16:53,340
So you seem to be at least confident
in your treatment of email.

2224
02:16:53,680 --> 02:16:55,630
Uh,
400 is a lot of email.

2225
02:16:55,690 --> 02:16:59,380
Do you have any particular commandments,

2226
02:16:59,381 --> 02:17:02,620
do's do nots times you check
things you check first.

2227
02:17:03,010 --> 02:17:08,010
Any types of systems or approaches that
allow you to maintain a degree of sanity

2228
02:17:09,700 --> 02:17:12,370
with, with the amount of
email that you must receive?

2229
02:17:14,800 --> 02:17:19,450
You're going to hate this answer?
I am terrible at it.

2230
02:17:19,960 --> 02:17:22,420
Um, it used to be, uh,

2231
02:17:22,480 --> 02:17:27,480
not so long ago that I personally replied
to absolutely every single email that

2232
02:17:28,811 --> 02:17:33,811
came in myself and I used to have an
auto sign that basically it was like,

2233
02:17:34,690 --> 02:17:39,160
if I don't reply to you within
five minutes, I'm dead or asleep.

2234
02:17:40,570 --> 02:17:44,890
And it's the opposite of everything
that you stand for. I know that

2235
02:17:46,570 --> 02:17:50,410
I was listening to Jason, so Jason
Fried's a friend, I was listening to his,

2236
02:17:50,830 --> 02:17:54,220
his podcast with you.
And um,

2237
02:17:54,730 --> 02:17:58,000
I don't get it at all.
Like I am not,

2238
02:17:58,910 --> 02:18:02,350
I would love nothing
more than, um, you know,

2239
02:18:02,351 --> 02:18:06,600
it's a rework or to not
work, um, you know, you know,

2240
02:18:06,730 --> 02:18:09,430
work four day weeks or to
have six week projects.

2241
02:18:09,431 --> 02:18:13,240
And all of this stuff that he espouses.
Um, he's a friend, he's an investor in,

2242
02:18:13,241 --> 02:18:16,840
in one of my businesses.
Um, but man, I don't,

2243
02:18:16,870 --> 02:18:19,000
that's not how I function at all.
Um,

2244
02:18:19,180 --> 02:18:22,600
and I really think that he misses
cause and effect a little bit.

2245
02:18:22,601 --> 02:18:26,740
Like he has a very successful company
and that's the cause that allows the

2246
02:18:26,741 --> 02:18:30,160
effect, which is the ability to
manage your time really well. Um,

2247
02:18:30,340 --> 02:18:33,520
I live really paranoid,
I'm more comfortable that way.

2248
02:18:34,540 --> 02:18:39,540
And also I kind of feel like a
weird moral responsibility to,

2249
02:18:40,240 --> 02:18:40,720
um,

2250
02:18:40,720 --> 02:18:45,490
reply to the people who've taken their
time out of their day to write us a note,

2251
02:18:45,640 --> 02:18:50,080
you know, um, even if it's not
like critical business for me. Um,

2252
02:18:50,140 --> 02:18:53,480
and one of the things I did for about
10 years that I loved doing, uh,

2253
02:18:53,560 --> 02:18:54,480
when we first started linea,

2254
02:18:54,481 --> 02:18:58,290
is that I would have Google alerts set
up and I would find some blog, you know,

2255
02:18:58,300 --> 02:19:01,870
that only like some woman
in her mother red, you know,

2256
02:19:02,290 --> 02:19:05,110
and I would reply
personally, like say, wow,

2257
02:19:05,111 --> 02:19:06,460
thank you for the great
writeup for Millennia.

2258
02:19:06,790 --> 02:19:11,620
And there'd be kind of mind blown that
I found it and you know, all that. Um,

2259
02:19:11,680 --> 02:19:14,560
I treated email that way for
a long period of time. Um,

2260
02:19:15,130 --> 02:19:17,980
unfortunately now I can't quite do that,

2261
02:19:18,250 --> 02:19:21,910
so I do have a bunch of
filters and whatnot, but I
didn't even set them up. Um,

2262
02:19:21,970 --> 02:19:23,890
my business partner,
Brian Fitzpatrick,

2263
02:19:24,100 --> 02:19:27,130
who used to be the head of Google Chicago
and he's my, he runs the engineering,

2264
02:19:27,390 --> 02:19:31,430
he's the CTO of talk. He kinda said like,
dude, you're, you're slipping man. Like,

2265
02:19:31,520 --> 02:19:34,190
you know, you need to grate
some filters and, and,

2266
02:19:34,191 --> 02:19:36,020
and get some stuff that's directly to you.

2267
02:19:36,021 --> 02:19:41,021
So he went into my Gmail accounts and
kind of kind of forced the issue for me.

2268
02:19:41,480 --> 02:19:44,530
Um, but so now I can't quite do that. Um,

2269
02:19:44,780 --> 02:19:48,590
I do wake up in the morning and look at
sort of our, our bazillion social media,

2270
02:19:49,010 --> 02:19:53,600
um, uh, messages and whatnot. Kind of
pick a random one and just answer it.

2271
02:19:53,870 --> 02:19:54,151
Like,
I,

2272
02:19:54,151 --> 02:19:59,150
I want to be involved in knowing
what our customers are asking,

2273
02:19:59,151 --> 02:20:02,060
what they're doing, what they're
saying, what they're applying,

2274
02:20:02,390 --> 02:20:05,720
anything that's a complaint actually
gets brought directly via email to a

2275
02:20:05,721 --> 02:20:08,330
complaint tracker that me and grant see.
Um,

2276
02:20:08,510 --> 02:20:10,490
and so luckily there
are that many of those,

2277
02:20:10,491 --> 02:20:14,330
but anytime you serve five or 6,000 people
a week, you're going to get, you know,

2278
02:20:14,331 --> 02:20:18,500
some, something going wrong. Um, but
man, I'm terrible at it, honestly,

2279
02:20:18,800 --> 02:20:19,640
and I think I've tried,

2280
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,430
I won't tell you a funny thing
is that when I go on vacation,

2281
02:20:22,431 --> 02:20:25,830
I do try to concoct a,
a,

2282
02:20:27,430 --> 02:20:30,800
a, a pretty funny, um, I
basically say like, look,

2283
02:20:31,150 --> 02:20:34,830
I'm going to be in a mountain or
on a boat or whatever and you're,

2284
02:20:34,880 --> 02:20:37,250
I'm not gonna be able to apply. Um, what?

2285
02:20:37,251 --> 02:20:42,251
And so I would make these
elaborate stories up almost
as like a fun piece of art

2286
02:20:42,500 --> 02:20:47,200
project as to why I couldn't do
it. And so one year, um, I, uh,

2287
02:20:47,300 --> 02:20:49,630
every year, every time I went
away, I would basically say like,

2288
02:20:49,640 --> 02:20:51,500
I'm going to visit a panda that I adopted

2289
02:20:52,620 --> 02:20:53,453
Chicago.

2290
02:20:54,060 --> 02:20:58,500
And it ended the year around Christmas
time when I went on break with a, with a,

2291
02:20:58,590 --> 02:20:59,110
with a,

2292
02:20:59,110 --> 02:21:04,110
a picture of a baby panda and a really
kind of mediocre Photoshop job of me

2293
02:21:05,221 --> 02:21:06,054
standing there

2294
02:21:07,410 --> 02:21:10,740
and attribute and called me up like
three days later going, you know,

2295
02:21:10,741 --> 02:21:14,970
is it going to the Lincoln Park Zoo? Like,
and I was like, no dear God, it's not.

2296
02:21:15,190 --> 02:21:18,720
And the following, there was
no panda. I look back though,

2297
02:21:18,970 --> 02:21:21,890
those might tell you reply to that. And
then the following year I said like, um,

2298
02:21:21,960 --> 02:21:23,940
I like to talk as you
might be able to tell.

2299
02:21:24,210 --> 02:21:28,500
And so everyone who knows me knows that
like I can just go on and on. Right.

2300
02:21:28,950 --> 02:21:30,090
And so I said,

2301
02:21:30,091 --> 02:21:34,650
I was going to a combination of a
tantric sex retreat and silence retreat

2302
02:21:36,350 --> 02:21:41,300
for eight days to explore my
both inner and outer self. And,

2303
02:21:41,330 --> 02:21:45,510
um, and you know, this is
your out of office reply.

2304
02:21:45,600 --> 02:21:50,580
That's my out of office replies and,
and, and anybody would get that.

2305
02:21:50,610 --> 02:21:54,870
Right.
And so I thought that was really funny.

2306
02:21:54,930 --> 02:21:56,550
And then about two years later,

2307
02:21:56,580 --> 02:22:01,290
I bumped into some guy who worked for a
very big corporation and they wanted to

2308
02:22:01,291 --> 02:22:04,050
do some work with,
with the one group,

2309
02:22:04,051 --> 02:22:06,330
and it was like kind of a
consulting project, very lucrative.

2310
02:22:06,900 --> 02:22:11,850
And he was looking at me really funny,
you know, and I said, like, what's up?

2311
02:22:11,880 --> 02:22:15,330
And he said, well, you know, I really
wish we had worked together, but you know,

2312
02:22:15,390 --> 02:22:16,780
then you went to that sex retreats.

2313
02:22:17,700 --> 02:22:20,550
I just couldn't get it past
everybody and I was just like,

2314
02:22:20,580 --> 02:22:22,560
I was looking at him going like,
what are you talking about?

2315
02:22:22,990 --> 02:22:25,710
And then I remembered like
four years earlier auto

2316
02:22:26,580 --> 02:22:31,110
out of office reply. And I told him
like, that it was kind of a joke,

2317
02:22:31,111 --> 02:22:33,390
like the panda and uh,

2318
02:22:34,500 --> 02:22:38,670
and he did not find any humor in it.
And I did. I thought it was hilarious,

2319
02:22:38,730 --> 02:22:41,680
even though we lost the business.
I thought it was really funny. Um,

2320
02:22:41,760 --> 02:22:45,810
so if you ever get a really
unusual out of office reply for me,

2321
02:22:46,470 --> 02:22:50,680
it's fiction probably. I love that. Uh,

2322
02:22:50,940 --> 02:22:52,110
I mean if you're serious all the time,

2323
02:22:52,111 --> 02:22:54,120
you're never going to get
the actual series work done.

2324
02:22:54,121 --> 02:22:56,070
You're going to burn out
before that ever happens.

2325
02:22:56,340 --> 02:23:00,810
I also want to underscore one thing and
then I want to ask you about a black box

2326
02:23:00,811 --> 02:23:04,320
at you and I have talked about quite
a bit, which is publishing. Uh,

2327
02:23:04,590 --> 02:23:09,590
the fact that you pick a message to
reply to even if it's one is really

2328
02:23:09,900 --> 02:23:10,950
important.

2329
02:23:10,980 --> 02:23:15,510
And I've noticed this certainly
with the audience that I have,

2330
02:23:15,900 --> 02:23:17,280
listeners, readers, et Cetera,

2331
02:23:17,760 --> 02:23:21,750
it is not physically possible
for me to reply to everyone.

2332
02:23:21,750 --> 02:23:26,070
It would also be anathema to everything
that I'm espousing a in many of the

2333
02:23:26,071 --> 02:23:29,220
books.
But I do want to,

2334
02:23:29,850 --> 02:23:34,230
I do want to demonstrate that I
am listening and I think that it,

2335
02:23:34,260 --> 02:23:38,790
it goes a really long way, even if
you do not personally reply to people,

2336
02:23:39,240 --> 02:23:44,240
if you are able to prove that you're
paying attention and that seems to resolve

2337
02:23:46,290 --> 02:23:51,290
a lot or at least act as a solve for
people out there who very seldom feel

2338
02:23:51,631 --> 02:23:55,290
heard, which does not always
necessitate a response.

2339
02:23:55,510 --> 02:24:00,000
So I just wanted to point out that it
might seem like a drop in the ocean,

2340
02:24:00,001 --> 02:24:04,800
but it actually has much further reaching
implications when you, when you do it,

2341
02:24:04,840 --> 02:24:09,660
what, what you were describing. I feel
like, um, it's genuine. First of all,

2342
02:24:09,661 --> 02:24:13,890
I'm always curious like what, what,
what are people writing about, um,

2343
02:24:13,920 --> 02:24:16,840
to the restaurants? What are
they writing about? To me? Um,

2344
02:24:16,860 --> 02:24:20,610
my linkedin profile basically,
like I don't really read Linkedin at all.

2345
02:24:20,611 --> 02:24:23,430
I keep it, I think it's
important to have it. Um,

2346
02:24:23,600 --> 02:24:27,300
but I don't ever read the messages on
there, but in my bio it basically says,

2347
02:24:27,301 --> 02:24:31,710
if you can find my email address, I will,
I will incite this, I will reply to you.

2348
02:24:32,350 --> 02:24:36,780
Um, and so that gets rid of all of
the marketing crap that comes in.

2349
02:24:36,960 --> 02:24:41,270
But every now and then I get like,
you know, a subject line, um,

2350
02:24:41,460 --> 02:24:45,930
to the email address that's on there
that says basically like, you know, hey,

2351
02:24:45,931 --> 02:24:49,150
via your linkedin bio, and
I'll, I'll read that and reply.

2352
02:24:49,440 --> 02:24:53,400
And it just shows me that like, hey,
there's an actual human on the other line.

2353
02:24:53,401 --> 02:24:56,520
It's not just a marketing
thing and be like, they really,

2354
02:24:56,521 --> 02:25:01,110
really do have something that they want
to talk about. Um, and so you know,

2355
02:25:01,111 --> 02:25:05,470
it's like little things like that are
kind of puzzle filters I guess that I call

2356
02:25:05,471 --> 02:25:09,450
them. Like where I just create like a
little bit of a little bit of a barrier.

2357
02:25:09,510 --> 02:25:13,770
And if you, um, if you're really into
it and you really want to talk to me,

2358
02:25:13,980 --> 02:25:17,760
you can pretty much find me pretty
easily. I'm not that hidden. Yeah,

2359
02:25:17,880 --> 02:25:21,870
the detail is really important here.
The mini hurdle. I have a friend,

2360
02:25:21,871 --> 02:25:23,980
I'm not going to mention by
name because get delusion, but

2361
02:25:23,980 --> 02:25:28,030
he is a very,
very successful author and journalist.

2362
02:25:28,060 --> 02:25:33,060
And when he is hiring for different
positions part time or full time at the

2363
02:25:33,461 --> 02:25:38,461
bottom of the job description on a
job site or wherever it might be in,

2364
02:25:39,380 --> 02:25:43,150
in small print,
at the very bottom it will say,

2365
02:25:43,151 --> 02:25:46,960
do not send a message on this platform.
Do not send an email,

2366
02:25:46,961 --> 02:25:49,120
even though email addresses given earlier,

2367
02:25:49,270 --> 02:25:53,410
call this number and leave a voicemail
answering the following things and

2368
02:25:53,411 --> 02:25:56,920
automatically he takes the pool of a
thousand people who are going to do the

2369
02:25:57,160 --> 02:26:01,870
wrong thing and finds the 10 people who
are actually paying attention. Yeah, 100%.

2370
02:26:01,990 --> 02:26:05,980
Uh, so publishing, what
is, I, we didn't really,

2371
02:26:06,010 --> 02:26:09,160
we didn't really talk much about it,
but can you give a little bit,

2372
02:26:09,580 --> 02:26:14,580
just a tiny bit of background on
the aviary and then some of your,

2373
02:26:15,760 --> 02:26:19,990
uh,
related publishing investigations,

2374
02:26:20,410 --> 02:26:24,390
which I think is, is not, I
think it's not a miss, uh,

2375
02:26:24,470 --> 02:26:28,810
in unappropriate word. Uh,
if, if you could give people
a little bit of of context.

2376
02:26:30,110 --> 02:26:30,651
Yeah.
I mean,

2377
02:26:30,651 --> 02:26:33,680
I'm going to back up before the aviary
just a little bit and just go like,

2378
02:26:34,220 --> 02:26:39,020
you know, for a chef, doing a cookbook
is something that they dream about.

2379
02:26:39,021 --> 02:26:42,230
If there are serious chef from
the time they're 15, you know,

2380
02:26:42,231 --> 02:26:45,590
just like if you're a basketball player,
you want to make the NBA or you know,

2381
02:26:45,591 --> 02:26:48,110
if you're a runner, you're going to
want to be in the Olympics or whatever.

2382
02:26:48,380 --> 02:26:50,150
Like to grant,
um,

2383
02:26:50,180 --> 02:26:55,180
to a bunch of chefs having their own
ideas in a physical beautiful cookbook,

2384
02:26:57,120 --> 02:27:00,770
um, is kind of a holy grail
for them. It's very sacred.

2385
02:27:02,090 --> 02:27:05,420
And what was interesting is that,
um,

2386
02:27:05,540 --> 02:27:07,190
just before grant was sick,

2387
02:27:08,420 --> 02:27:13,310
we started getting a lot of publishing
offers and the natural inclination was to

2388
02:27:13,311 --> 02:27:16,920
go to what he knew, which
was artisan press, um,

2389
02:27:16,940 --> 02:27:21,020
which published at the French laundry
book, which is one of the bestselling, um,

2390
02:27:21,180 --> 02:27:23,870
high end cookbooks ever.
And it's certainly beautiful.

2391
02:27:23,900 --> 02:27:26,480
It was very revolutionary at its time.
Uh,

2392
02:27:26,481 --> 02:27:28,760
I think it was published in about
[inaudible] 98 [inaudible] 99,

2393
02:27:28,790 --> 02:27:31,280
something like that. And, um,

2394
02:27:31,460 --> 02:27:34,580
the typical publishing deal
like kind of came into us,

2395
02:27:34,640 --> 02:27:37,700
which was great that they were
coming in and it was, you know,

2396
02:27:37,701 --> 02:27:39,950
250 to $300,000.

2397
02:27:40,550 --> 02:27:43,730
And they would basically
say, well, out of that,

2398
02:27:43,760 --> 02:27:48,760
like you're going to pay for the designer
and the photographer and you need like

2399
02:27:49,701 --> 02:27:53,000
a 30 day photo shoot and you know,

2400
02:27:53,001 --> 02:27:56,180
here are the guidelines for how many
photos you want in the book and you know,

2401
02:27:56,181 --> 02:27:57,980
to keep costs down and this and that.

2402
02:27:58,670 --> 02:28:02,360
And I kind of looked at all of that and
all the offers came in within about 10%

2403
02:28:02,361 --> 02:28:06,710
of each other, which immediately, you
know, the hair on the back of my neck,

2404
02:28:06,711 --> 02:28:07,850
like the spidey sense,

2405
02:28:08,290 --> 02:28:11,930
spidey sense just telling me that
something back there is pricing this in an

2406
02:28:11,990 --> 02:28:14,420
unusual way. And then, um,

2407
02:28:15,350 --> 02:28:19,700
and then I started going
like, oh, this is actually,

2408
02:28:19,701 --> 02:28:20,930
you liked the music industry.

2409
02:28:23,150 --> 02:28:24,310
I knew people in,

2410
02:28:24,311 --> 02:28:29,311
in bands that would get signed to a record
label back in the day and they would

2411
02:28:31,041 --> 02:28:33,230
get a quarter million dollar advance.
You know,

2412
02:28:33,260 --> 02:28:36,380
shit that's seems like a lot of money,
right? And then all of a sudden,

2413
02:28:36,440 --> 02:28:40,550
all your studio time comes out of that
and you don't recoup another dime until

2414
02:28:40,580 --> 02:28:42,870
you've sold,
you know,

2415
02:28:42,950 --> 02:28:47,770
x number of records or cds or in
this case books. And then in the,

2416
02:28:47,780 --> 02:28:50,090
in the contract it actually said,

2417
02:28:50,180 --> 02:28:54,170
and the restaurant guarantees that they
will buy 2,500 bucks at half of retail

2418
02:28:54,171 --> 02:28:58,160
price. And I was like,
Whoa, that's, you know,

2419
02:28:58,161 --> 02:29:01,820
you're looking at something like $80,000
right there that goes right back to

2420
02:29:01,821 --> 02:29:05,750
them in essence. Like, and
then I kind of went like, well,

2421
02:29:05,751 --> 02:29:07,790
I wonder what a book costs to print.

2422
02:29:08,810 --> 02:29:13,550
And I mean, I just call it,
I asked them like, well,

2423
02:29:13,551 --> 02:29:16,250
how much does this book and the cost
of print? Well, I don't really know.

2424
02:29:16,820 --> 02:29:21,410
And so what they would do is that they
would always have layers of people so

2425
02:29:21,411 --> 02:29:24,950
that they said, well, that's not what I
do. Like I am the person that does this.

2426
02:29:24,951 --> 02:29:28,260
The lawyers give the contract, the
printer does the printing. Like I,

2427
02:29:28,400 --> 02:29:32,870
there's always plan a plausible
deniability or plausible ignorance.

2428
02:29:33,140 --> 02:29:37,370
Yes. Willful plausibly
ignorance. Yeah. Um, and,

2429
02:29:38,570 --> 02:29:40,670
and so I, I do what I started
doing. I'm like, well,

2430
02:29:40,671 --> 02:29:45,380
let's just Google that up and see what it
costs to print a book or hey, how many,

2431
02:29:45,410 --> 02:29:48,110
how many copies of the
French laundry books sold,

2432
02:29:49,430 --> 02:29:54,140
how many copies of 50 other books
that we wanted to emulate or that we,

2433
02:29:54,260 --> 02:29:58,580
that we thought were
well done sold. And, um,

2434
02:29:58,970 --> 02:30:01,940
man, it's like asking for like, you know,

2435
02:30:01,941 --> 02:30:05,240
keys to the Vatican or something when
you call a publisher and asked them that,

2436
02:30:05,800 --> 02:30:10,100
um, they, I'm sure you know this, right?
You probably know now because you've,

2437
02:30:10,210 --> 02:30:11,660
you've been so entrenched in the industry,

2438
02:30:11,661 --> 02:30:14,630
like you know your numbers and you
might know who the head of some of your

2439
02:30:14,631 --> 02:30:16,970
colleagues and friends, right? Um,

2440
02:30:17,030 --> 02:30:21,890
but if you want it to actually do a
meaningful comparison across the industry,

2441
02:30:22,310 --> 02:30:24,440
it's almost impossible to do it.

2442
02:30:24,470 --> 02:30:26,210
Even though that there is
a company that does that,

2443
02:30:26,570 --> 02:30:29,810
then you start trying to reverse engineer
it and you go to the New York Times,

2444
02:30:29,811 --> 02:30:32,840
which you can go to the New York Times
website and just look at how has the New

2445
02:30:32,840 --> 02:30:36,640
York Times, uh, you know,
bestseller list, um,

2446
02:30:36,980 --> 02:30:41,360
created and on their own site they say
it's a compendium of known publishers

2447
02:30:41,390 --> 02:30:45,380
like publishing houses as well as
these like top 50 retailers, you know,

2448
02:30:45,381 --> 02:30:50,300
back in the day. Um, and it's
a game mobile system, right?

2449
02:30:50,330 --> 02:30:51,520
Like the way that,

2450
02:30:51,550 --> 02:30:54,800
that the publisher publishers want to
do it is that they want to ship out all

2451
02:30:54,801 --> 02:30:57,050
the books at the same time because that's
how they're counted for the New York

2452
02:30:57,051 --> 02:31:00,670
Times bestseller list and stuff.
I should also know it's not only gainable,

2453
02:31:00,680 --> 02:31:05,680
but it's also conversely s highly
subjective within the New York Times.

2454
02:31:07,131 --> 02:31:09,490
So there, there's a lot of
wiggle room. In other words,

2455
02:31:09,860 --> 02:31:14,480
it is not like the Olympics.
We were like, okay, clear gold,

2456
02:31:14,510 --> 02:31:19,130
silver, bronze video replay. We
know exactly how this was, was, uh,

2457
02:31:19,160 --> 02:31:19,980
was it was

2458
02:31:19,980 --> 02:31:24,120
tabulated. Um, yeah. So the more
that we dug, the more that, um,

2459
02:31:24,150 --> 02:31:27,810
we got like Curie,
like more and more curious,

2460
02:31:27,840 --> 02:31:30,060
a little bit angry actually.
And,

2461
02:31:30,061 --> 02:31:33,890
but grant was weirdly angry at me
because he's going like, well dude, like,

2462
02:31:34,980 --> 02:31:36,900
why do you care? I, you know,

2463
02:31:36,901 --> 02:31:40,620
it's like I've been wanting this since
I was 15 and I was like, well, look,

2464
02:31:40,621 --> 02:31:43,600
if this is our budget, it's not
going to be the book you want this.

2465
02:31:43,610 --> 02:31:46,800
I can be as good as you want it to be
because we're not going to able to spend

2466
02:31:46,830 --> 02:31:50,430
six months doing the photography. We're
not going to be able to get great pages.

2467
02:31:50,520 --> 02:31:52,800
We're not gonna be able to get a
picture of every dish. Like if,

2468
02:31:52,801 --> 02:31:56,490
what do people cook in a cookbook while
they tend to cook those pages where they

2469
02:31:56,491 --> 02:32:00,510
see a picture of the final dish, because
you know what? It looks delicious.

2470
02:32:00,540 --> 02:32:03,090
You know, it's supposed to look like
you've got something to emulate at least.

2471
02:32:03,150 --> 02:32:05,940
Right.
And so when we did the specs for the book,

2472
02:32:06,450 --> 02:32:10,200
I had one of the best publishers in
America say, if you do that book,

2473
02:32:10,230 --> 02:32:12,960
there's no way you sell
more than 5,000 oh no way.

2474
02:32:13,320 --> 02:32:17,520
And no one's going to publish it and
you can't use metric and you can't use a

2475
02:32:17,521 --> 02:32:22,521
gram scale and you can't have that font
and you can't have those pictures and

2476
02:32:22,771 --> 02:32:25,020
full bleed and it'll cost
way too much to print.

2477
02:32:25,680 --> 02:32:30,680
And so it took about a month and a half
before I got lucky and I called a print

2478
02:32:30,871 --> 02:32:33,480
broker who had actually printed,
you know,

2479
02:32:33,790 --> 02:32:38,580
brokered the print job of one of the
famous books and I was expecting that the

2480
02:32:38,581 --> 02:32:43,581
book retails for $60 it would cost like
15 to print 20 I didn't know anything

2481
02:32:44,011 --> 02:32:44,844
about it.

2482
02:32:45,060 --> 02:32:50,060
And when he told me it was like $2 and
23 cents per book to print per thirty

2483
02:32:51,660 --> 02:32:56,000
thousand thirty thousand copy run. I
went no way like that. And he went, well,

2484
02:32:56,001 --> 02:33:00,360
it's probably less now. Like you
thought I meant it was like too much.

2485
02:33:01,010 --> 02:33:04,470
And instantaneously I went,
oh shit.

2486
02:33:04,830 --> 02:33:06,510
Like everything makes sense.

2487
02:33:07,200 --> 02:33:11,640
And when I would call publishers and
tell them this, there we go. Oh yeah,

2488
02:33:11,641 --> 02:33:15,880
but look like we did 40
different prints, la, you know,

2489
02:33:15,900 --> 02:33:20,700
40 different books last year. Only
five of them did well. And I'm like,

2490
02:33:20,730 --> 02:33:23,340
that's your problem man.
Like I know what we're going to sell.

2491
02:33:23,341 --> 02:33:27,930
Well I don't really give a shit if you
lost 35% of the time and it needs to

2492
02:33:27,931 --> 02:33:32,670
spread your portfolio risk, I'm the
one you're spreading it on. Right.

2493
02:33:33,210 --> 02:33:37,990
And so, um, so we decided,
um, with the Alinea book, um,

2494
02:33:38,610 --> 02:33:43,610
we put together like 20 pages and Martin
made this beautiful stainless steel

2495
02:33:43,681 --> 02:33:46,890
bracketing system and we shipped it
out to eight different publishers.

2496
02:33:46,890 --> 02:33:50,880
We like two of which were art houses
that had never done a cookbook.

2497
02:33:51,390 --> 02:33:53,720
And they all came back and,

2498
02:33:53,730 --> 02:33:56,550
and same all the usual criticism
except for Aaron Wayner.

2499
02:33:56,551 --> 02:33:59,900
It tends to be press smart, smart,
smart guy, by the way. Yeah.

2500
02:33:59,910 --> 02:34:04,350
And he basically said, I'm going to make
you an unusual offer, no advance at all.

2501
02:34:04,830 --> 02:34:06,780
And we can negotiate,
essentially,

2502
02:34:06,781 --> 02:34:11,400
we'll just be the distributor and we'll
negotiate out like what that looks like.

2503
02:34:11,580 --> 02:34:13,680
And we'll help you with the printing
and we'll help you with the editing,

2504
02:34:13,710 --> 02:34:17,040
which were both really good at.
And within 10,

2505
02:34:17,410 --> 02:34:22,410
we had struck a deal whereby any of
the books that we bought or sold for

2506
02:34:22,931 --> 02:34:27,100
ourselves, for our restaurant, we paid
actual printing costs, not wholesale,

2507
02:34:27,850 --> 02:34:29,680
a actual printing costs.
Um,

2508
02:34:29,770 --> 02:34:33,370
anything that they sold and
distributed through their channels,

2509
02:34:33,700 --> 02:34:36,610
they would get about
27% of the sale price,

2510
02:34:36,730 --> 02:34:41,440
which means that we've got 73% of
that. Um, these are like state secrets,

2511
02:34:41,680 --> 02:34:45,400
right? Like, like nobody tells this stuff.

2512
02:34:45,910 --> 02:34:50,910
And so for years I was walking around
with this knowledge where if we sold

2513
02:34:51,700 --> 02:34:54,110
100000 bucks, say, um,

2514
02:34:54,220 --> 02:34:57,730
that would be the equivalent of selling
like 500,000 bucks on any other deal.

2515
02:34:58,210 --> 02:35:00,820
And we got to control the quality of it.

2516
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:03,680
And we won both the James
Beard Award for best, um,

2517
02:35:03,820 --> 02:35:07,570
cooking from a professional point of view,
best cookbook of the year. And we won.

2518
02:35:07,960 --> 02:35:10,840
I say we,
Martin and Laura Kasner one,

2519
02:35:10,870 --> 02:35:15,250
the communication arts award where if
you're a designer that's like their annual

2520
02:35:15,251 --> 02:35:18,180
is like,
that's like getting the the Oscar right.

2521
02:35:18,490 --> 02:35:19,990
Similarly for people who
don't know what I mean,

2522
02:35:19,991 --> 02:35:24,160
the James Beard awards are
also very much like the Oscars.

2523
02:35:24,610 --> 02:35:28,720
Yeah. So, so we felt like
really vindicated on that. Um,

2524
02:35:28,721 --> 02:35:32,710
the book still sells. This is eight
years later, we still sell seven,

2525
02:35:32,711 --> 02:35:37,300
8,000 copies a year. Um, and
when we did the Aviary, um,

2526
02:35:37,450 --> 02:35:42,370
which is our bar, that's a non bar,
um, that we talked about earlier. Um,

2527
02:35:42,880 --> 02:35:43,420
you know,

2528
02:35:43,420 --> 02:35:47,440
we started getting all of the same offers
again and this time it was really easy

2529
02:35:47,441 --> 02:35:52,420
to go, like, just kinda like,
oh, like, oh, that's cute. Like,

2530
02:35:52,421 --> 02:35:56,920
you know, um, and so I
should add that we did,

2531
02:35:57,220 --> 02:35:59,800
I wrote a,
a book of grant,

2532
02:35:59,840 --> 02:36:03,160
I wrote his memoir together that
we didn't use a ghost writer.

2533
02:36:03,161 --> 02:36:06,190
We wrote it ourselves called life
on the line. And for that one,

2534
02:36:06,220 --> 02:36:07,870
we did a traditional book deal,

2535
02:36:08,020 --> 02:36:12,160
but after our agent
kind of got it halfway,

2536
02:36:12,161 --> 02:36:17,100
I got on our plane and flew out there
and then brokered the deal myself. Um,

2537
02:36:17,200 --> 02:36:18,890
and I got,
um,

2538
02:36:19,360 --> 02:36:24,220
a giant multiple of the highest bid
by doing essentially a reverse Dutch

2539
02:36:24,221 --> 02:36:27,070
auction, starting at a really high
price and working my way downward.

2540
02:36:27,280 --> 02:36:30,370
Can you explain to people just
briefly with them? Yeah, yeah.

2541
02:36:30,371 --> 02:36:35,120
So basically like here, I'll
do this, like let's say I,

2542
02:36:35,200 --> 02:36:40,200
so I think one of the great problems like
to solve one of the black boxes is the

2543
02:36:40,601 --> 02:36:45,160
agency problem. Let's say you want to
sell your house, you put it on the market,

2544
02:36:45,220 --> 02:36:48,400
and the agent's going to get, I don't
know, four to 5% of the sale price.

2545
02:36:48,401 --> 02:36:51,490
That's a lot for something. It's like
your most biggest investment in your life.

2546
02:36:52,160 --> 02:36:55,960
Um, but they kind of say like,
they control the information,
they control the mls,

2547
02:36:55,961 --> 02:36:58,960
all that. Um, will they, if
they're the seller's agent,

2548
02:36:58,961 --> 02:37:03,030
get the highest price for you? And the
answer is almost certainly not. Um,

2549
02:37:03,280 --> 02:37:06,580
because they, let's say a house
is gonna sell for $500,000,

2550
02:37:06,581 --> 02:37:11,350
they're going to get 4% of that.
That's $20,000. If they get, um,

2551
02:37:11,620 --> 02:37:16,220
$490,000, um, it's almost no
difference to them write 400

2552
02:37:16,220 --> 02:37:20,060
bucks difference. But if they lose the
deal over that last 10,000, it's a lot.

2553
02:37:20,600 --> 02:37:22,680
So they want to price a home,
um,

2554
02:37:22,700 --> 02:37:26,180
so that it sells quickly so that they
can keep their deal flow going and they

2555
02:37:26,181 --> 02:37:29,930
don't really care about maximizing
their last dollar. Whereas for you,

2556
02:37:29,960 --> 02:37:34,710
that last dollar is actually like
$9,600. It's a lot more money. Um,

2557
02:37:34,790 --> 02:37:38,390
so what I do whenever I've sold real
estate is that I figured out what the

2558
02:37:38,391 --> 02:37:39,920
intrinsic value is of the house.

2559
02:37:39,921 --> 02:37:42,410
Like what's the bare minimum that
I'd be willing to sell it for?

2560
02:37:42,950 --> 02:37:45,290
And I price it just
slightly higher than that.

2561
02:37:45,380 --> 02:37:47,600
And I tell all the agents
and the whole town,

2562
02:37:48,070 --> 02:37:51,260
I will pay you 50% of everything
over 10% higher than that.

2563
02:37:53,960 --> 02:37:57,860
And they all say, oh, that's
against the real state ethics code.

2564
02:37:57,861 --> 02:38:01,760
Or I would never do that deal because
it was a vert all my other deals or

2565
02:38:01,761 --> 02:38:02,480
whatever.

2566
02:38:02,480 --> 02:38:06,440
And then what happens is two days later
you get like a dozen phone calls and

2567
02:38:06,441 --> 02:38:08,480
they've priced it like 40% higher

2568
02:38:10,580 --> 02:38:13,720
and they're like the, it
sells in two days. Yeah.

2569
02:38:14,320 --> 02:38:17,270
Cause now they're actually
working for you. Right. Well,

2570
02:38:17,570 --> 02:38:19,610
it similarly I went into that,

2571
02:38:19,650 --> 02:38:24,350
that publishing negotiation and I was
kind of like, by the way, the agent,

2572
02:38:24,430 --> 02:38:27,200
um, it's probably look up until
she's great like great person.

2573
02:38:27,230 --> 02:38:30,590
I don't think she even knows
that that's what was happening.

2574
02:38:31,070 --> 02:38:33,920
Do you know what I mean? Like, I don't
even think she knows it. Like, Hey,

2575
02:38:33,921 --> 02:38:35,090
she was brought up in this,

2576
02:38:35,150 --> 02:38:38,300
in this industry for this company
and that's the way it works.

2577
02:38:38,360 --> 02:38:41,060
And shoot for sure. Dispute
everything I just said. She would say,

2578
02:38:41,061 --> 02:38:45,920
I always try to get the highest price,
but I went in and I just went like,

2579
02:38:45,921 --> 02:38:50,600
look, I'm not gonna spend my time doing
this for x. So I need four times that.

2580
02:38:50,750 --> 02:38:52,790
And she was like,
there's no way you'll ever get that.

2581
02:38:52,791 --> 02:38:55,250
You've never written a book before. And
I said, well, we did the Alinea book.

2582
02:38:55,280 --> 02:38:59,330
That's a cookbook, doesn't count.
These are words, you know, so,

2583
02:38:59,510 --> 02:39:00,480
so I,

2584
02:39:00,690 --> 02:39:05,680
I went to the publishers that I'll bid
on it and I just got them all on a,

2585
02:39:05,681 --> 02:39:10,220
on a conference call and just started at
a really high price and every couple of

2586
02:39:10,220 --> 02:39:14,180
seconds I went down $10,000 and then
one of them blinked and bought it.

2587
02:39:17,060 --> 02:39:21,180
What was the great way? That's a
great method of price discovery. Um,

2588
02:39:21,230 --> 02:39:21,951
like if you think about it,

2589
02:39:21,951 --> 02:39:25,280
most auctions even like you
go to a charity event or
whatever and they start low

2590
02:39:25,281 --> 02:39:26,750
and they try to get interest going high.

2591
02:39:27,170 --> 02:39:30,740
It's often the case that if they start
really, really high and start going down,

2592
02:39:31,580 --> 02:39:34,220
people start going like, oh my God,
someone's gonna say something like,

2593
02:39:34,221 --> 02:39:37,640
I would pay that someone
else must as well.

2594
02:39:37,940 --> 02:39:40,790
They could be off by a factor of 30%
and they'll never even know it because

2595
02:39:40,791 --> 02:39:45,190
there's only one bid that ever happened.
So no one knows how off they are. No.

2596
02:39:45,250 --> 02:39:47,840
On that phone call where he's like,
hey guys,

2597
02:39:47,890 --> 02:39:52,890
would love to get you on the
phone and then publish right away.

2598
02:39:53,750 --> 02:39:55,370
So I guess my question is,

2599
02:39:55,371 --> 02:40:00,371
did they know that they were signing
up for a Mexican standoff slash Jesse?

2600
02:40:02,210 --> 02:40:06,130
Oh, they did. They did. I went and met
with them all personally. Kind of said,

2601
02:40:06,230 --> 02:40:08,750
if you're like, John, I'd love to get you
on the phone. And that's like, all right,

2602
02:40:08,810 --> 02:40:10,500
congratulations guys. Yeah, you can't,

2603
02:40:10,910 --> 02:40:15,810
you can't ambush people to
a Mexican standoff. Yes, you
can't do that. Um, I, I mean,

2604
02:40:15,811 --> 02:40:19,260
you could, it might be fun, but I didn't
do that. All right. I went and talked.

2605
02:40:19,950 --> 02:40:24,900
I created enticement. I sold on
my ability to actually do it. Um,

2606
02:40:24,960 --> 02:40:29,250
it was a bit like, um, doing the
no phones, um, with the software.

2607
02:40:29,460 --> 02:40:30,181
Like I was like,
well,

2608
02:40:30,181 --> 02:40:32,460
if I get a really big contract off to
figure out how to write and book and

2609
02:40:32,461 --> 02:40:37,430
there'll be a lot of pressure. Um,
and so, so I did that and, um, and,

2610
02:40:37,460 --> 02:40:41,940
and, and I wrote it and I turned it in on
time, which apparently no one does. Very,

2611
02:40:41,941 --> 02:40:46,560
very rare. But yeah, to them, like under
David's do, they went, what's this?

2612
02:40:46,561 --> 02:40:50,420
And I'm like, that's the manuscript.
Yeah. Oh that's cute. Well,

2613
02:40:50,470 --> 02:40:54,540
it's kind of like showing
up at the restaurant on time
as a diner and then being

2614
02:40:54,541 --> 02:40:59,220
seated at the appointment time.
It's just this like open,

2615
02:40:59,550 --> 02:41:04,110
open lie teaching your books
in time. I do actually. Yeah,

2616
02:41:04,170 --> 02:41:08,120
I believe that. Yeah. I do turn
my books in on time. Uh, and we,

2617
02:41:08,130 --> 02:41:11,530
we could get into that separate topic.
I just want to ask you a question. I do.

2618
02:41:11,670 --> 02:41:15,660
I do. I do not turn them in at the, uh,

2619
02:41:15,760 --> 02:41:19,560
expected length
longer perhaps.

2620
02:41:19,820 --> 02:41:24,320
I do tend to turn on.
So what happened with that,

2621
02:41:24,360 --> 02:41:27,330
but the aviary is that we,
like,

2622
02:41:27,690 --> 02:41:30,600
we basically couldn't figure
out how to do another book, um,

2623
02:41:30,630 --> 02:41:35,630
because the Alinea book was such a project
and Martin was on to other things and

2624
02:41:38,700 --> 02:41:40,080
we didn't want to do it traditionally.

2625
02:41:40,200 --> 02:41:42,840
And I didn't know anyone who
could do what we wanted to do.

2626
02:41:42,990 --> 02:41:46,080
And then there was this guy,
Ellen hamburger and boy,

2627
02:41:46,110 --> 02:41:49,870
if you get nothing else from this whole
talk and you've made it this far, um,

2628
02:41:49,920 --> 02:41:53,550
go see, go Google, uh,
Allen and Alinea. Um,

2629
02:41:53,630 --> 02:41:57,750
Allen is a procedural effects artists.
Uh,

2630
02:41:57,820 --> 02:42:01,380
he worked at what a studios and all the
hobbit movies doing like hair and water

2631
02:42:01,381 --> 02:42:05,850
and things like that. Um, so he writes
the physics that then makes the,

2632
02:42:06,600 --> 02:42:09,780
makes the magic. Right. Um, and then, uh,

2633
02:42:10,560 --> 02:42:15,240
he worked at Pixar and while he was
at Pixar and his wife Sarah worked at

2634
02:42:15,241 --> 02:42:18,750
industrial light and magic
as a graphics designer. Um,

2635
02:42:18,930 --> 02:42:23,930
he was given by Sarah a copy of the
Alinea book to go full circle and became,

2636
02:42:24,511 --> 02:42:26,640
just fascinated with it.
Was Not a cook,

2637
02:42:26,641 --> 02:42:29,850
didn't know how to cook and
did the Julie and Julia thing,

2638
02:42:30,510 --> 02:42:34,170
he spent five years not only,
um,

2639
02:42:34,500 --> 02:42:39,420
cooking his way through the entire book,
but also would do things like,

2640
02:42:39,421 --> 02:42:41,400
well,
I don't know where to get this plate.

2641
02:42:41,460 --> 02:42:43,230
And I've always wanted to
learn how to fire porcelain.

2642
02:42:44,950 --> 02:42:49,930
Alan for people wondering is a l l e n
there are also videos of Allen and Alinea.

2643
02:42:50,310 --> 02:42:52,770
Yeah.
And he's an autodidact.

2644
02:42:52,800 --> 02:42:57,800
Like this guy learns and learns and
learns and is the kind of person that goes

2645
02:42:58,020 --> 02:42:59,280
to the black box and goes,

2646
02:42:59,820 --> 02:43:02,580
I'm going to learn how to forge knives
and I'm going to learn how to fire

2647
02:43:02,581 --> 02:43:03,690
porcelain.
And by the way,

2648
02:43:03,691 --> 02:43:06,080
I'm going to cook everything in there
and I'm gonna take pictures of him and

2649
02:43:06,090 --> 02:43:07,440
make a book documenting that.

2650
02:43:08,010 --> 02:43:12,230
And when he asked if he could use
like we had kind of a little email

2651
02:43:12,250 --> 02:43:15,580
relationship and he came out to linea
wants to ask grant some questions about

2652
02:43:15,581 --> 02:43:18,190
how to make something cause it wasn't
working and when grant kind of threw up

2653
02:43:18,191 --> 02:43:19,720
his arms to go by,
the book might be wrong.

2654
02:43:21,220 --> 02:43:25,580
Like Ellen's world view was shattered. It
was like fine. And he was kind of like,

2655
02:43:25,600 --> 02:43:26,650
what you mean? It could be wrong. He goes,

2656
02:43:26,651 --> 02:43:28,600
well yeah we did have
some Murata in there.

2657
02:43:28,601 --> 02:43:31,420
Like I mean we documented hundreds
of recipes. It could be wrong.

2658
02:43:32,080 --> 02:43:36,240
And at that point like his mentality
change. It's in the video and,

2659
02:43:36,241 --> 02:43:41,241
and we got to know him and I got to
know him and when he sent me the book,

2660
02:43:42,700 --> 02:43:46,000
it wasn't what I was expecting.
I was expecting like a homegrown book.

2661
02:43:46,480 --> 02:43:50,170
And what I got was, you
know, a 400 page beautifully,

2662
02:43:50,590 --> 02:43:51,970
beautifully illustrated,

2663
02:43:52,330 --> 02:43:56,440
beautifully written book about
a person's journey of learning,

2664
02:43:57,070 --> 02:44:00,970
um, and it was called the
Alinea project. And I had no,

2665
02:44:01,300 --> 02:44:04,930
no idea that he had
done anything like this.

2666
02:44:05,890 --> 02:44:10,150
And so suddenly, um, I
thought to myself immediately,

2667
02:44:10,151 --> 02:44:13,810
and it's in the intro to the aviary book,
um,

2668
02:44:14,260 --> 02:44:16,900
I texted him and said,
Holy Shit, you're crazy.

2669
02:44:18,400 --> 02:44:20,050
And I have ideas.

2670
02:44:21,130 --> 02:44:24,910
And after waiting for like four or
five years to do a book on the Aviary,

2671
02:44:24,940 --> 02:44:26,830
I immediately was like,
this is the guy to do the book.

2672
02:44:27,400 --> 02:44:29,500
Now I need to lure him out of Pixar,

2673
02:44:30,670 --> 02:44:32,860
which is about the best
place to work in the world.

2674
02:44:34,510 --> 02:44:37,090
And then I found out his wife worked at
industrial light and magic and she did

2675
02:44:37,091 --> 02:44:39,190
all the graphic design and I was like,
this is perfect.

2676
02:44:39,340 --> 02:44:41,470
You guys need to quit your
jobs and moved to Chicago.

2677
02:44:42,310 --> 02:44:46,900
And they flew out, we had
some conversations about
what that might look like.

2678
02:44:47,060 --> 02:44:50,800
Um, it was very much a partnership.
Um, they would have equity in the book.

2679
02:44:51,190 --> 02:44:55,070
We would have creative freedom to
do it exactly the way we wanted. Um,

2680
02:44:55,510 --> 02:44:58,690
we knew more about the printing
and the bidding and all of that.

2681
02:44:58,691 --> 02:45:00,550
So I wasn't worried about
the economics of it anymore.

2682
02:45:00,730 --> 02:45:05,140
I was worried about trying to make
something really awesome and right as they

2683
02:45:05,141 --> 02:45:07,470
were about to say yes,
they were,

2684
02:45:07,660 --> 02:45:09,430
they found out that they
were going to have a baby.

2685
02:45:11,350 --> 02:45:14,890
So they called me up one day and said,
oh my God, like, and I was like, oh,

2686
02:45:14,891 --> 02:45:18,130
they got cold feet. Oh No. And he
said, you know, we're pregnant,

2687
02:45:18,160 --> 02:45:19,270
we're going to have a
baby. And I said, okay,

2688
02:45:19,271 --> 02:45:22,540
well we're going to wait a year because
there's no way in the world I'm letting

2689
02:45:22,541 --> 02:45:26,980
you move out out of your comfort zone
and have a child and to have that change

2690
02:45:26,981 --> 02:45:27,814
of life.

2691
02:45:27,850 --> 02:45:32,170
And they thought I was like punting
on them just because like in a

2692
02:45:32,171 --> 02:45:35,050
discriminatory way. And I
said, nope, we're not going
to do this with anyone else.

2693
02:45:35,051 --> 02:45:37,990
We will wait as long as it takes.
And about a year and a half later,

2694
02:45:37,991 --> 02:45:41,650
they moved to Chicago and we spent
the last year and a half, um,

2695
02:45:41,680 --> 02:45:46,540
set up a studio of our own, spent the
last year and a half doing this book. Um,

2696
02:45:46,690 --> 02:45:50,230
did a Kickstarter to just
essentially raise awareness for it.

2697
02:45:50,260 --> 02:45:52,300
We raised almost half a million
dollars in the Kickstarter.

2698
02:45:52,680 --> 02:45:57,490
We sold about another $300,000 a book
since then. Uh, it comes out in October.

2699
02:45:57,580 --> 02:45:59,230
Um,
you can go the Alinea book.com.

2700
02:45:59,260 --> 02:46:02,650
And the coolest part of that website
is that if you look at the Alinea book,

2701
02:46:03,060 --> 02:46:07,100
I'll, sorry, DVD book.com,
very ugly, very late.

2702
02:46:07,720 --> 02:46:10,140
It's marketing right there. So, um,

2703
02:46:10,220 --> 02:46:11,710
yeah, the Aviary book.com. But if you,

2704
02:46:11,780 --> 02:46:15,470
the coolest part of that is other than
of course your ability to buy said book

2705
02:46:15,770 --> 02:46:20,270
is um, Alan kept a blog on
there called our progress.

2706
02:46:20,960 --> 02:46:25,790
And in it he details every single aspect
of what it takes to make a book like

2707
02:46:25,791 --> 02:46:28,580
this right down to line screens.

2708
02:46:28,640 --> 02:46:32,060
And compositing photos of,
you know,

2709
02:46:32,061 --> 02:46:36,710
like one of the things that every single
book publisher told me is that you

2710
02:46:36,711 --> 02:46:39,470
can't sell a cocktail
book from earning $30.

2711
02:46:39,620 --> 02:46:43,820
There's no market for it and you don't
need pictures because it's just a liquid

2712
02:46:43,821 --> 02:46:44,654
in a glass.

2713
02:46:45,740 --> 02:46:49,640
And I think we blew that out of the
water with what the book looks like. Um,

2714
02:46:49,670 --> 02:46:54,670
I think that because certain things
like fire are really hard to photograph.

2715
02:46:55,340 --> 02:46:57,790
Um, there's a great picture in
there of this one cocktail where we,

2716
02:46:58,090 --> 02:47:03,080
we spray some antidotes and we light it
on fire and it creates an aroma into the

2717
02:47:03,081 --> 02:47:06,430
bowl that it's served in. It's
called loaded to the gun walls. Um,

2718
02:47:06,470 --> 02:47:08,180
it's a Batavia rock cocktail.

2719
02:47:08,630 --> 02:47:12,470
And like that took a composite
of 18 different photographs.

2720
02:47:13,490 --> 02:47:18,140
And so he breaks down the photography
techniques and also the New York Times

2721
02:47:18,141 --> 02:47:22,130
bestseller list. And I showed
him like how, you know,

2722
02:47:22,190 --> 02:47:25,520
Google target marketing works and
Facebook ads work and all that.

2723
02:47:25,521 --> 02:47:28,310
And all of a sudden he went, Holy
Shit, I had no idea you could do this.

2724
02:47:28,730 --> 02:47:33,710
So we are going completely
without a distributor and
publisher of this time. Um,

2725
02:47:33,830 --> 02:47:38,540
and I think we're going to set a man,
I don't know,

2726
02:47:38,541 --> 02:47:40,940
like I,
I'm either completely delusional.

2727
02:47:41,150 --> 02:47:44,220
It wouldn't surprise me if we sold
a half a million of these. Yeah.

2728
02:47:44,490 --> 02:47:46,700
And in the next two or three
years and it's, yeah, it's not a,

2729
02:47:46,790 --> 02:47:51,650
not a nine 95 book either,
which it shouldn't be. Right.
I mean, this is, it's $85.

2730
02:47:51,720 --> 02:47:52,553
Um,

2731
02:47:52,640 --> 02:47:57,640
we've invested close to a million dollars
all the way in around it and it looks

2732
02:47:58,341 --> 02:48:02,000
like it. I think, I hope, um, yeah.
From what about, from what I've seen,

2733
02:48:02,001 --> 02:48:05,750
it looks like it would cost more than
that. Yeah. Well we did, you know,

2734
02:48:05,751 --> 02:48:09,260
we did it all ourselves too. Um, you know,
it's really like a five person project.

2735
02:48:09,800 --> 02:48:13,580
Um, it's, it's deep enough that
if, if a professional gets it,

2736
02:48:13,610 --> 02:48:16,640
they're gonna learn a lot.
Um, but I'd say about 35,

2737
02:48:16,641 --> 02:48:20,390
40% of it can be done at home because
unlike the Alinea book where Hey,

2738
02:48:20,391 --> 02:48:22,240
you've got to go out and
buy duck, like, you know,

2739
02:48:22,241 --> 02:48:24,680
in your local grocery might not
have this kind of duck or whatever.

2740
02:48:24,920 --> 02:48:29,300
If you need some Florida kind of
run or you know, um, you know,

2741
02:48:29,301 --> 02:48:30,500
a certain kind of Tequila or whatever,

2742
02:48:30,530 --> 02:48:33,650
you just go to your local liquor store
and it's exactly the same thing that we

2743
02:48:33,651 --> 02:48:36,380
use. Um, you know, that
product is universal.

2744
02:48:37,490 --> 02:48:41,260
I read somewhere that the, I don't
think it's taking us too far afield.

2745
02:48:41,270 --> 02:48:45,180
I read somewhere that you
consider yourself as Keela
guy or at least in part a

2746
02:48:45,181 --> 02:48:45,771
Tequila guy.

2747
02:48:45,771 --> 02:48:50,771
Do you have any favorite
tequilas or concoctions?

2748
02:48:51,800 --> 02:48:56,570
Well, there's, so I just am going
to do a little video promo for um,

2749
02:48:56,660 --> 02:49:00,370
for the book that we just filmed last
week where essentially I work with Eric

2750
02:49:00,410 --> 02:49:02,750
[inaudible] who's one of our
bartenders in the office,

2751
02:49:02,751 --> 02:49:05,300
which is our little
speakeasy below the aviary,

2752
02:49:05,330 --> 02:49:09,210
which is amazing if people have
the opportunity to check it out.

2753
02:49:09,570 --> 02:49:11,700
It's basically grant said,
hey, everything upstairs.

2754
02:49:11,701 --> 02:49:13,560
People are gonna think it's
Alinea smoke and mirrors.

2755
02:49:13,590 --> 02:49:15,240
We need to prove we can
make a real cocktail.

2756
02:49:15,630 --> 02:49:20,190
So one of the foundational
cocktails for me is, is a Daiquiri.

2757
02:49:20,730 --> 02:49:25,260
It's a, I say three ingredients
in a million ways to fuck
it up. You know, it's,

2758
02:49:25,261 --> 02:49:30,060
it's just lime, sugar and rum.
That's all it is. And, uh,

2759
02:49:30,180 --> 02:49:34,740
and yet like most bars you go into will
make a terrible Daiquiri or they'll

2760
02:49:34,741 --> 02:49:38,580
blend it or blah, blah, blah. Right?
But a great Daiquiri is really,

2761
02:49:38,581 --> 02:49:41,610
really transformative. So
did a video on that. Um,

2762
02:49:41,640 --> 02:49:45,420
and then I always make a half mescal
Margarita. That's my favorite drink.

2763
02:49:45,690 --> 02:49:49,920
All I'm doing is I'm taking some reposado
and a little bit of mezcal and equal

2764
02:49:49,921 --> 02:49:53,390
weights along with, um,
some, uh, you know, uh,

2765
02:49:53,400 --> 02:49:58,200
grandma or nay or quantro equivalent
and lime and simple syrup.

2766
02:49:58,260 --> 02:50:02,760
That's it. That's all there is to it. Um,
man, I love the simple stuff like that.

2767
02:50:02,790 --> 02:50:07,370
And then we have a whole section in the
book on old whiskeys, dusty bottles, um,

2768
02:50:07,500 --> 02:50:08,520
old gins.

2769
02:50:08,580 --> 02:50:13,110
Like there's a growing movement to kind
of rediscover some of the distilleries

2770
02:50:13,111 --> 02:50:17,520
in America that were really,
really, really great, um,
that don't exist anymore.

2771
02:50:17,670 --> 02:50:22,200
Um, that were more artisinal at the time.
And you can still find those bottles, um,

2772
02:50:22,290 --> 02:50:24,900
around, uh, it's a little bit
easier than like, you know,

2773
02:50:24,901 --> 02:50:29,430
someone like wine collecting or
something like that. And um, I mean it's,

2774
02:50:29,431 --> 02:50:30,840
it's like an endlessly fascinating thing.

2775
02:50:30,841 --> 02:50:34,290
I don't consider myself a
cocktail person 10 years ago.

2776
02:50:34,390 --> 02:50:36,440
I really loved wine.
Um,

2777
02:50:36,480 --> 02:50:38,970
I felt like from a health
perspective it was better as well.

2778
02:50:39,390 --> 02:50:40,590
But just like anything else,

2779
02:50:40,591 --> 02:50:45,591
if you have a well constructed
cocktail and something of high quality,

2780
02:50:46,100 --> 02:50:47,610
um,
it's an additive thing.

2781
02:50:47,640 --> 02:50:51,660
Like you can have it in a meal and it
can make the meal better. Um, you know,

2782
02:50:51,661 --> 02:50:55,500
whereas it's like, you know, a
vodka tonics just boozing, um,

2783
02:50:55,740 --> 02:50:58,770
has just getting drunk. Um, that's
not what we're trying to do here.

2784
02:50:58,771 --> 02:51:00,000
We're trying to make things that are,

2785
02:51:00,360 --> 02:51:04,040
it's really a culinary approach
to cocktails and a man. It's,

2786
02:51:04,050 --> 02:51:09,030
it's endlessly fascinating. Just like
anything else in this world. And the,

2787
02:51:09,090 --> 02:51:12,160
the, the, I would also
say just contrasting,

2788
02:51:12,270 --> 02:51:16,040
say someone who wants to
recreate something from Alinea,

2789
02:51:16,050 --> 02:51:17,010
which you certainly could do.

2790
02:51:17,011 --> 02:51:20,890
I mean Ellen prove that with
something from the aviary. The,

2791
02:51:20,891 --> 02:51:25,891
there's also a tremendous amount of
theater and presentation dynamism that you

2792
02:51:27,241 --> 02:51:31,800
can create with cocktails that does
not have to be super expensive or super

2793
02:51:31,801 --> 02:51:34,150
complicated. Uh, that, uh,

2794
02:51:34,440 --> 02:51:37,770
I mean certainly you guys are able
to go as complex as you want to go,

2795
02:51:37,800 --> 02:51:42,250
which is stunning and I've spent
time at the Aviary, but it's all,

2796
02:51:43,290 --> 02:51:47,550
you can easily make some ice with patriots
bitters in it or something like that.

2797
02:51:47,760 --> 02:51:49,380
And then as the ice
melts and the cocktail,

2798
02:51:49,381 --> 02:51:51,840
it's going to change the flavor and
it's going to look really cool too.

2799
02:51:52,230 --> 02:51:55,140
I'm doing some of these things
at home is, is not hard. Um,

2800
02:51:55,170 --> 02:51:57,940
I did a dinner party once
where it was like, you know,

2801
02:51:57,941 --> 02:52:01,800
a cocktail party probably had 40 people
at my house and each room in my house

2802
02:52:01,801 --> 02:52:06,010
had all of the ingredients for the
cocktail and then a little instructions

2803
02:52:06,010 --> 02:52:07,300
on how to make it themselves.

2804
02:52:07,630 --> 02:52:10,480
So that took away the need for a
bartender because they're terrible anyway.

2805
02:52:10,481 --> 02:52:12,780
Anyone that you'd bring in
and you know that, you know,

2806
02:52:12,800 --> 02:52:13,870
a caterer or something like that.

2807
02:52:14,230 --> 02:52:17,170
And the other cool thing is that people
got really into it. They went like, oh,

2808
02:52:17,230 --> 02:52:20,260
like I only know how to make
an old fashion. Now I know
how to make a Manhattan.

2809
02:52:20,740 --> 02:52:22,190
Um, you know, uh,

2810
02:52:22,630 --> 02:52:26,410
the one that I discovered that party
was a Frisco's sour had like Benedictine

2811
02:52:26,411 --> 02:52:29,380
whiskey and lemon, you know,
it was really delicious.

2812
02:52:29,650 --> 02:52:31,930
So it can be,

2813
02:52:32,280 --> 02:52:34,990
it can be more than just
like a strong cocktail.

2814
02:52:35,020 --> 02:52:36,940
It can be really delicate and interesting

2815
02:52:38,690 --> 02:52:43,690
and people can learn all
about this@theaviarybook.com.

2816
02:52:45,230 --> 02:52:48,770
Is that right? Right. Yup. Well, nick,

2817
02:52:48,771 --> 02:52:51,830
I've have to rapid fire
questions that are unrelated.

2818
02:52:51,920 --> 02:52:53,720
And then I think we're gonna,
we're gonna,

2819
02:52:53,930 --> 02:52:58,910
we're gonna bring this neat
and tidy round one podcast, uh,

2820
02:52:58,940 --> 02:53:00,770
to, uh, to, uh, to a close.

2821
02:53:00,771 --> 02:53:05,771
But we've talked about books and everybody
should not only check out the aviary

2822
02:53:06,951 --> 02:53:11,600
book, but also if they have a
chance to go to the aviary. It is,

2823
02:53:11,630 --> 02:53:12,500
it is tremendous.

2824
02:53:12,501 --> 02:53:17,501
And you can also get some
delicious bites and food.

2825
02:53:18,980 --> 02:53:23,660
Uh, at least last time I was there stuck
in at the aviary. So it is a bit of a,

2826
02:53:23,810 --> 02:53:27,500
I hesitate to call it a work around,
but you guys have some very,

2827
02:53:27,501 --> 02:53:30,200
very popular establishments.
If you want to sample the food,

2828
02:53:30,590 --> 02:53:35,410
this is also a great way to do it. Uh, and
the drinks are just incredible. So it's,

2829
02:53:35,411 --> 02:53:40,411
it's a real sort of destination that
makes a trip to Chicago a worth it and of

2830
02:53:41,781 --> 02:53:43,760
itself. So I would recommend
not only checking out the book,

2831
02:53:43,761 --> 02:53:46,760
but also checking out a lot
of what you guys are up to.

2832
02:53:47,990 --> 02:53:52,100
Aside from that books you've gifted the
most other people outside of those that

2833
02:53:52,101 --> 02:53:53,120
you've made yourself,

2834
02:53:53,150 --> 02:53:56,120
what are the books that you've
gifted the most to other people?

2835
02:53:57,370 --> 02:54:00,790
Yeah, I named one of them already.
Um, the fooled by randomness,

2836
02:54:00,820 --> 02:54:05,620
almost everyone in my office is
forced to read that. Um, you know, um,

2837
02:54:05,710 --> 02:54:09,670
and I've, I've definitely
given that away. Um, boy,

2838
02:54:09,671 --> 02:54:13,300
that's a tricky one because I just,
like I said, I can't remember.

2839
02:54:13,740 --> 02:54:16,540
I can't remember books. Um, very well,

2840
02:54:16,541 --> 02:54:21,220
but that's certainly probably number
one. Um, on a business side of things.

2841
02:54:21,520 --> 02:54:24,040
And then the, on the other side, um,

2842
02:54:24,100 --> 02:54:27,550
I tend to give away what I
would call vintage art books.

2843
02:54:27,580 --> 02:54:30,100
So it's not a book people can buy,
I'm sorry to say,

2844
02:54:30,101 --> 02:54:32,690
but occasionally I'll be like,

2845
02:54:32,691 --> 02:54:37,000
you used bookstore and I'll find some
of these great old art books and I buy a

2846
02:54:37,001 --> 02:54:39,610
few of them. And then when I, when I
want to thank someone for something,

2847
02:54:39,611 --> 02:54:40,630
I send him that

2848
02:54:41,130 --> 02:54:44,420
peregrinations of an epicurean,
something like that. Yeah.

2849
02:54:44,430 --> 02:54:46,350
I mean at the end of the day,
like

2850
02:54:46,930 --> 02:54:50,880
I bought like when I want
to give someone something,

2851
02:54:50,940 --> 02:54:55,350
I tried to make it something that you and
I really want to make it a great gift.

2852
02:54:55,840 --> 02:54:59,610
Um, I try to get it something
that you can't buy. Right.

2853
02:55:00,150 --> 02:55:04,400
And so I bought an old
typewriter and I write,

2854
02:55:04,401 --> 02:55:05,810
when I write a thank you note,

2855
02:55:06,200 --> 02:55:10,730
I type it up on the old typewriter and it
is the most confounding thing to people

2856
02:55:12,440 --> 02:55:14,710
because they look at it and they go,
how did you do that?

2857
02:55:14,740 --> 02:55:18,380
I'm like on a 1922 type writer.
Um,

2858
02:55:18,730 --> 02:55:22,250
it's like a personal
artisinal thing. Um, but I,

2859
02:55:22,251 --> 02:55:24,890
I know that that's not what
you're getting at. No, I can't,

2860
02:55:24,891 --> 02:55:27,890
I can't really think of, I can't
really think of like the number one.

2861
02:55:27,891 --> 02:55:31,970
I'm sure once we, we, we end this, I'll
immediately think of it. And if I do,

2862
02:55:32,180 --> 02:55:33,560
I'll send it to you so you can link to it.

2863
02:55:33,940 --> 02:55:37,250
I think the answer, the answer is more
interesting with the typewriter. So I,

2864
02:55:37,251 --> 02:55:41,400
I think, uh, what I'm getting
at was whatever you just
offered, so that's perfect.

2865
02:55:41,910 --> 02:55:45,690
And if you come up with anything else, we
can put it in the show notes. Uh, this,

2866
02:55:45,720 --> 02:55:50,580
this next one. It can be tough at times
for folks, but the billboard questions,

2867
02:55:50,581 --> 02:55:54,750
so metaphorically speaking,
noncommercial, no advertising,

2868
02:55:54,751 --> 02:55:58,230
but if you could get a, a
word, a quote, a sentence,

2869
02:55:58,231 --> 02:56:03,231
a question up on a billboard to transmit
something to millions or billions of

2870
02:56:04,201 --> 02:56:07,200
people. Does anything come to mind
that you might put on that billboard?

2871
02:56:07,740 --> 02:56:12,090
I don't know why this came to mind,
but the, but the word would be pause.

2872
02:56:12,540 --> 02:56:13,373
Hmm.

2873
02:56:13,830 --> 02:56:16,400
As it, I have no idea why that
came to mind, but I think in,

2874
02:56:16,860 --> 02:56:21,610
in talking through this
whole thing, you know, it's,

2875
02:56:22,350 --> 02:56:26,190
you, you kept asking me like, why are
you digging this black box or whatever,

2876
02:56:26,340 --> 02:56:30,900
or it'd be like, um, curiosity,
like, and I think those are two,

2877
02:56:31,350 --> 02:56:34,140
I'm thinking of those in the same
way. I'm not saying pause, like stop.

2878
02:56:34,790 --> 02:56:38,910
I'm saying think right.
And so I think, um,

2879
02:56:39,480 --> 02:56:41,020
you know, the, the hallmark of,

2880
02:56:41,050 --> 02:56:46,020
of the people that I like as friends the
best is what we try to instill in our

2881
02:56:46,021 --> 02:56:47,670
kids. Uh, you know, and,

2882
02:56:47,671 --> 02:56:50,910
and the reason I like my wife so much
and all that is that intellectual

2883
02:56:50,911 --> 02:56:55,700
curiosity is everything.
And so, um, I dunno,

2884
02:56:55,710 --> 02:56:58,650
how do you get that on a billboard?
I think pause or, you know,

2885
02:56:58,651 --> 02:57:01,540
be curious or something like
that. I know it's Cliche, but I,

2886
02:57:02,030 --> 02:57:04,410
I think that's the thing,
the thread that ties everything together.

2887
02:57:05,350 --> 02:57:06,760
Yeah.
You do pause a lot.

2888
02:57:06,820 --> 02:57:11,500
Even though on a macro
level you seem to be moving,

2889
02:57:12,090 --> 02:57:15,820
uh,
at hyper speed a lot of the time.

2890
02:57:16,120 --> 02:57:20,200
There are a lot of pauses built into
that. Speed, if that makes sense.

2891
02:57:21,460 --> 02:57:22,840
From what I've noticed.
I mean your assignment,

2892
02:57:22,870 --> 02:57:26,830
you are simultaneously one of the
craziest fuckers I know and uh,

2893
02:57:26,860 --> 02:57:28,900
least craziest fuckers.
I know. If that makes,

2894
02:57:29,460 --> 02:57:33,400
that's a great counselor. I'll
take, I'll take it. I'll take it.

2895
02:57:34,610 --> 02:57:37,910
And uh,
where can people find you?

2896
02:57:37,911 --> 02:57:42,230
I know you have of course the Alinea
group.com you have Splore talk.com,

2897
02:57:42,260 --> 02:57:43,520
the Aviary,
book.com,

2898
02:57:43,521 --> 02:57:47,180
which is the sort of the most timely
for people to check out right now.

2899
02:57:47,420 --> 02:57:52,130
If people want to say hello or
follow you on social where the best,

2900
02:57:52,131 --> 02:57:56,660
uh, best, best places, best handles
for that. Yup. Uh, Instagram, uh,

2901
02:57:56,661 --> 02:57:59,990
which is ending conus,
Kyoko nes and uh,

2902
02:58:00,020 --> 02:58:02,400
Twitter is Nick Kokonas

2903
02:58:02,490 --> 02:58:06,180
and I C K and uh, hey,
it's all googleable, right?

2904
02:58:06,230 --> 02:58:08,460
Like so that if you could figure it out,

2905
02:58:08,461 --> 02:58:13,020
my email address and I'll probably answer,
although given the given the reach of,

2906
02:58:13,021 --> 02:58:17,430
of, of your podcast, perhaps I will be
inundated and might take a while. Yeah,

2907
02:58:17,431 --> 02:58:19,260
that might be a hug of death situation,

2908
02:58:19,261 --> 02:58:23,700
but we will say TBD problem to have
I suppose. Good problem to have.

2909
02:58:24,060 --> 02:58:27,690
Nick, this was a blast. Thank you so
much for taking the time. I really,

2910
02:58:27,691 --> 02:58:31,530
really appreciate him and many
more conversations to be had this.

2911
02:58:31,531 --> 02:58:34,890
I think another trip to Chicago may be
in order, so say I hope we see you here.

2912
02:58:34,891 --> 02:58:38,520
So I know I need to get back
and to everybody listening,

2913
02:58:38,521 --> 02:58:41,430
we've made mention of the show notes,

2914
02:58:41,460 --> 02:58:43,590

2915

2917
02:58:54,600 --> 02:58:59,370
thank you so much for listening.
Hey guys, this is Tim again.

2918
02:58:59,371 --> 02:59:02,550
Just a few more things before
you take off. Number one,

2919
02:59:02,790 --> 02:59:07,740
this is five bullet Friday.
Do you want to get a short email from me?

2920
02:59:07,770 --> 02:59:10,380
Would you enjoy getting a short
email from me every Friday?

2921
02:59:10,680 --> 02:59:14,910
That provides a little more soul of
fun before the weekend and five bullet

2922
02:59:14,911 --> 02:59:19,530
Friday is a very short email where I share
the coolest things I've found or that

2923
02:59:19,531 --> 02:59:21,120
I've been pondering over the week.

2924
02:59:21,330 --> 02:59:24,090
That could include favorite new
albums that I've discovered.

2925
02:59:24,091 --> 02:59:27,570
It could include Gizmos and gadgets
and all sorts of weird shit that I've

2926
02:59:27,571 --> 02:59:31,860
somehow dug up in the, uh, the
world of the esoteric as I do.

2927
02:59:32,160 --> 02:59:37,160
It could include favorite articles that
I've read and that I've shared with my

2928
02:59:37,830 --> 02:59:40,530
close friends for instance.
And it's very short.

2929
02:59:40,620 --> 02:59:45,570
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness
before you head off for the weekend.

2930
02:59:45,660 --> 02:59:50,130
So if you want to receive that, check it
out. Just go to four hour work week.com.

2931
02:59:50,160 --> 02:59:54,840
That's four hour workweek.com all spelled

2932

if you sign up, I hope you enjoy it.

2933
02:59:59,160 --> 03:00:03,360
This episode is brought to you by
Charlotte's web, which makes a CBD oil,

2934
03:00:03,770 --> 03:00:07,230
a hemp extract that has become
one of my go to tools. Now,

2935
03:00:07,830 --> 03:00:12,030
I have never really talked about CBD oil
and cannabis has never really been the

2936
03:00:12,031 --> 03:00:15,720
plant for me. I know we're talking
about head, uh, but nonetheless,

2937
03:00:15,900 --> 03:00:20,460
after several nights of inexplicably
insomnia, this is about a year ago.

2938
03:00:20,461 --> 03:00:24,720
I just could not get to sleep to save
my life and after other fixes failed,

2939
03:00:24,721 --> 03:00:29,370
so Melatonin California poppy extract
of it ended up in a lead athlete,

2940
03:00:29,371 --> 03:00:33,540
introduced me to this non psychoactive
extract. Then Bam, problem solved.

2941
03:00:33,600 --> 03:00:36,390
I had some of the best sleep
that I've had in months.

2942
03:00:36,480 --> 03:00:38,670
Now I don't use sleep
aids on a daily basis,

2943
03:00:38,671 --> 03:00:43,110
but this has become part of my toolkit
and I hope to be exploring other

2944
03:00:43,111 --> 03:00:44,070
applications soon.

2945
03:00:44,370 --> 03:00:49,370
CVD oil products have exploded in
popularity in the health and wellness and

2946
03:00:49,621 --> 03:00:53,880
fitness worlds and Charlotte's web is one
of the top players that offers a broad

2947
03:00:53,881 --> 03:00:57,690
spectrum hemp extract with
CVD in the form of oils,

2948
03:00:57,691 --> 03:00:59,680
capsules and topical products.

2949
03:01:00,190 --> 03:01:04,000
Charlotte's web products will not get
you high so that maybe that is good news,

2950
03:01:04,001 --> 03:01:04,811
may have bad news to you,

2951
03:01:04,811 --> 03:01:09,400
but it does have some powerful benefits
and the applications and it works with

2952
03:01:09,401 --> 03:01:12,190
your body's existing
endocannabinoid system.

2953
03:01:12,670 --> 03:01:16,660
Endo meaning from within
like endo versus exoskeleton.

2954
03:01:16,680 --> 03:01:19,810
Francis endocannabinoid
system works with your body.

2955
03:01:20,110 --> 03:01:25,030
Some of the most common uses are for
leaf from everybody's stressors help in

2956
03:01:25,031 --> 03:01:28,530
supporting restful sleep, which
is what I most often use for, uh,

2957
03:01:28,570 --> 03:01:30,610
to bring about a sense of calm and focus.

2958
03:01:30,610 --> 03:01:34,960
A lot of my friends who's for that CBD
is also known on becoming known for

2959
03:01:34,961 --> 03:01:37,930
helping athletes to recover from
exercise induced inflammation.

2960
03:01:38,530 --> 03:01:42,310
Charlotte's web hemp extract has
naturally occurring terpenes, flavonoids,

2961
03:01:42,311 --> 03:01:45,210
and other valuable have compounds
that works synergistically to heighten

2962
03:01:45,220 --> 03:01:48,580
positive effects, sometimes
referred to as the entourage effect,

2963
03:01:48,581 --> 03:01:52,570
but you guys can look up making it
more complete than a single compound.

2964
03:01:52,571 --> 03:01:53,710
CBE alternatives,

2965
03:01:53,890 --> 03:01:58,890
at least that is what I've been told by
not a bunch about CBD alternative North

2966
03:01:59,350 --> 03:02:01,720
Single compound. In
any case, check it out.

2967
03:02:01,721 --> 03:02:06,460

many of you know, I've used 99
designs for many, many years now.

2992
03:03:41,590 --> 03:03:44,620
I've used them for book covers,
putting mock ups for the four hour body,

which went on to become a number

Tao of Seneca ebook series basically,

2995
03:03:51,970 --> 03:03:55,570
and other graphic design projects and
I've been very impressed by the quality of

2996
03:03:55,571 --> 03:03:58,940
their designers and illustrators and you
can check out all sorts of stuff like

2998
03:04:02,840 --> 03:04:07,840
Most recently I used 99 designs to uptick
illustrations and layout of my five

2999
03:04:08,751 --> 03:04:10,010
morning rituals ebook.

newsletter.

3002
03:04:15,470 --> 03:04:18,890
The illustrations inside are gorgeous
and I loved working with the designer.

3003
03:04:18,950 --> 03:04:22,160
We ended up selecting for the project.
