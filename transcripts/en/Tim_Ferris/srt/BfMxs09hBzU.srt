1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,890
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02,891 --> 00:00:06,130
I can run flat out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,430
I'm a cybernetic organism
living this year.

4
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:28,880
This episode is brought to you by Peloton
and I'd heard about Peloton over and

5
00:00:28,881 --> 00:00:29,690
over again,

6
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:34,610
but I ended up getting a Peloton bike
in the whole system after I saw my buddy

7
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,730
Kevin Rose, I've known him
forever, some of you know,

8
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,760
and he showed up at my gate at my house
a while back and he looked fantastic.

9
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:48,020
I asked him, is it dude? You look great.
What the hell have you been up to?

10
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,150
Because he's always doing
a weird diet or another,

11
00:00:50,151 --> 00:00:51,710
but it only lasts like a week or two.

12
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:55,520
So he always regresses to the mean
after like 75 beers and he said,

13
00:00:55,521 --> 00:00:58,100
I've been doing Peloton
five days a week now.

14
00:00:58,101 --> 00:01:02,780
That caught my attention because Kevin
does nothing five days a week and you

15
00:01:02,781 --> 00:01:06,050
know, I love you Kevin, but
it really peaked my curiosity,

16
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,080
ended up getting a system and it's
become an integral part of my week.

17
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:15,980
I love it and I really didn't expect to
love it at all because I find cycling

18
00:01:15,981 --> 00:01:17,660
really boring usually,

19
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:22,670
but peloton is an indoor cycling bike
that brings live studio classes right into

20
00:01:22,671 --> 00:01:23,504
your home.

21
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:26,090
You don't have to worry about fitting
classes into your schedule or making it to

22
00:01:26,091 --> 00:01:28,130
a studio with some type of commute,

23
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,660
etc. New classes are added every day and
this includes options led by elite New

24
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,130
York City instructors
in your own living room.

25
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:38,150
You can even livestream studio classes
taught by the world's best instructors or

26
00:01:38,151 --> 00:01:41,180
find your own favorite
class on demand and in fact,

27
00:01:41,181 --> 00:01:45,410
Kevin and I rarely do live classes
and you can compete with your friends,

28
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,840
which is also fun. Kevin,
I'm coming after you,

29
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,200
but we usually just use classes on demand.

30
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,740
I really like not Wilbur's and his iron,

31
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:56,780
high intensity training
sessions that are shorter,

32
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:01,810
like 20 minutes and I think
Kevin's favorite is Alex
and everyone seems to have

33
00:02:02,571 --> 00:02:06,980
their favorite instructor or you can
select by music duration and so on.

34
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:11,990
Each Peloton bike includes a 22 inch
HD touchscreen performance tracking

35
00:02:11,991 --> 00:02:12,501
metrics.

36
00:02:12,501 --> 00:02:16,790
I think that that along with the realtime
leaderboard are the main reasons that

37
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:21,470
this caught my attention when cycling
never had caught my attention before.

38
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,980
It's really pretty stunning what they've
done with the user interface to keep

39
00:02:24,981 --> 00:02:25,814
your attention.

40
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:29,900
The belt drive is quiet and it's smaller
than you would expect so it can fit in

41
00:02:29,901 --> 00:02:33,860
a living room or an office.
I actually have it in a large closet,

42
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:37,280
believe it or not and
it fits with no problem.

43
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:42,290
So peloton is offering all of you guys,
listeners of the Tim Ferriss show,

44
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:47,291
a special offer and it is actually special

47
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,130
You might say Matt accessories.
Wait,

48
00:03:01,131 --> 00:03:05,780
I don't need fancy towels or whatever
other supplemental bits and pieces.

49
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,970
No,
the shoes you need,

50
00:03:07,971 --> 00:03:11,000
you need the clip in shoes and
those are in the accessory category.

51
00:03:11,001 --> 00:03:14,900

this episode is brought
to you by 99 designs.

61
00:03:55,231 --> 00:04:00,231
I've used 99 designs for ages since even
before podcasting was a thing and I've

62
00:04:01,411 --> 00:04:03,330
used them for all sorts
of graphic design needs.

63
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:07,140
They are fast and they are convenience
whether you need a logo, website,

64
00:04:07,141 --> 00:04:08,730
book cover or anything else.

65
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,060
I've done competitions for instance for
book covers related to the four hour

66
00:04:12,061 --> 00:04:14,040
body.
99 designs,

67
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:19,370
makes great design accessible to
everyone and it makes the process so much

68
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,513
easier.

69
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:25,550
And I used them recently for artwork
and illustrations inside of my Tao of

70
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,530
Seneca set of books.

71
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,100
So this is a collection of stoic
writing in modern interviews and so on.

72
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:36,180
So for the Tao of Seneca, I decided to
use their one to one project service.

73
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,500
In this case, you invite a
specific designer to your
project, agree on a price,

74
00:04:40,501 --> 00:04:42,420
and then work together
until you're satisfied.

75
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,570
And the artwork just blew my mind.
Uh,

76
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:49,050
you have to check it out.
I kid you not.

77
00:04:49,051 --> 00:04:52,410
So you can check out some of
the artwork from Tufts, Seneca,

78
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:57,540
as well as some artwork and logos and so

Today's guest is [inaudible] Phd. Oh
my goodness. Are you in for a treat?

89
00:05:39,951 --> 00:05:43,490
You're going to hear about everything
from monkeys and birthday cakes to

90
00:05:43,491 --> 00:05:46,100
building a personal board
of advisors for yourself.

91
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:48,620
I'm not going to give you the buyout
right this second because you're going to

92
00:05:48,621 --> 00:05:50,660
hear it from a live recording.

93
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:55,950
The live recording was taken at sixth
and I very famous historic location in

94
00:05:56,331 --> 00:06:00,650
Washington, DC sixth and i.org.
You can check them out. We're,

95
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:04,610
I interviewed two different people
in separate sessions. Steve case,

00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:09,670
the Co founder of AOL and known for many
other things and then m Sanjin who you

97
00:06:10,311 --> 00:06:12,950
are going to hear from next.
Enjoy.

98
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:20,190
Everybody loosened up. Limbered all
right, let's just jump right into it.

99
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:23,340
So this is going to be fun.
I've been looking forward to this,

100
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,850
trying to make this happen, hoping
to make this happen and here we are.

101
00:06:26,851 --> 00:06:28,170
So let me just jump right into it.

102
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:34,220
Our next guest is m Sanjen Phd,

103
00:06:34,221 --> 00:06:37,590

specializing in how nature preserves and

104

106
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:47,100
We haven't met before and we'll get
into that size and joined ca in 2014 as

107
00:06:47,101 --> 00:06:50,550

and senior scientist and his

108
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:54,720
divisions. I'm just underscoring
that for you guys including oceans,

109
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:59,100
science development, brand and
communications and strategic priorities.

110
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:03,240
That sounds like a lot a Sanjay and
holds a doctorate from the University of

111
00:07:03,241 --> 00:07:06,090
California Santa Cruz and
his peer reviewed scientific
work has been published

112

He is a visiting researcher at Ucla and
they distinguished professor of practice

114

raised in Southeast Asia in Africa.

115
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,241
Sanjenis background,

116
00:07:18,241 --> 00:07:21,540
the expertise provided a unique
lens for hosting and cohosting,

117
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:25,200
a range of documentaries for PBS,
BBC discovery and showtime.

118
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:29,310
Most recently he owes to the University
of California and vox media is climate

119
00:07:29,311 --> 00:07:32,820
lab series.

123
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,970
Please welcome to the stage M.
Sanjay,

124
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:54,763
welcome.

125
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:57,361
All right,

126
00:07:57,361 --> 00:08:01,260
so I want to start with something we were
discussing very briefly before we get

127
00:08:01,261 --> 00:08:04,440
up here. And I said, wait, wait, wait.
Don't tell me I want to hear the story,

128
00:08:04,441 --> 00:08:08,430
but let's save it.
What is your full birth name?

129
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:15,280
Oh No, audio, audio,
mic, microphone check.

130
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:20,110
Hello. Hello? Hello. There we go.
Okay. Can you guys hear me okay?

131
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,110
Um, first of all, Tim
called me up yesterday

132
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:33,230
when I was in Botswana
getting on a flight,

133
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,470
22 hours to get here and said,
hey,

134
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,830
you in DC because I'm going to
be there. And I'm like, yeah,

135
00:08:39,831 --> 00:08:43,850
but I'm not just arriving. But that the
end effect, well I'm there for 24 hours,

136
00:08:43,851 --> 00:08:46,550
but hey, I'd love to see you. Do you want
to come to this thing? Oh by the way,

137
00:08:46,551 --> 00:08:47,630
you want to be on stage.

138
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,800
And I'm not very good at saying no,

139
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:56,370
which we'll get to having listened to
this last podcast about saying no to

140
00:08:56,371 --> 00:09:00,990
things, but I feel so much better today
because I realize it isn't a last minute

141
00:09:00,991 --> 00:09:03,900
invitation cause he did the
same thing to Steve Case.

142
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:10,320
Really good about it. Okay.
So, um, I'm a towel. Uh,

143
00:09:10,321 --> 00:09:13,120
I'm from Sri Lanka and some of
us are just given one names.

144
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,410
So on my birth certificate
it just says Sanjay,

145
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:21,840
but my dad's name,
which I use as a last name,

146
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:26,370
like from my American passport,
um, is Muktar Lincoln.

147
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:31,200
And I don't use it much for two reasons.

148
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:35,170
I've actually never one reason to the
obvious one because if someone said Doctor

149
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,590
Lincoln, Lincoln would be my
dad who would look, not me.

150
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,190
So I don't associate it
distinctly with myself.

151
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:47,060
That's the reason I've told everyone
that reason I don't tend to use it and

152
00:09:47,191 --> 00:09:50,070
never,
ever told this to anyone,

153
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:55,470
at least not in a public audience,
is that when it came to America,

154
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:59,610
people have this obsession about what
your name means. They always ask me like,

155
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,160
oh wow, cool man. What
does that mean mean?

156
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:06,000
Like I don't go around going like Michael,
what does your name mean?

157
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:09,420
I'm an angel. I get
it. It doesn't come up.

158
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,000
But they do tend to ask that
are foreigners for some reason.

159
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,330
And the problem is this name muck.

160
00:10:17,331 --> 00:10:21,900
The lingam quite literally
means giant pill. Penis.

161
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:26,730
Okay.

162
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,690
And until I was like a junior,

163
00:10:28,691 --> 00:10:33,610
I was deeply like conscious of
that and I would never say it.

164
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:39,150
And then one day in a bar somehow it kind
of blurted out and the reaction I got

165
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:45,430
was relief. And so then it became
not a problem anymore. So the thing

166
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:51,040
that sounds like a last name meeting, I
would shout from the rooftops, you know,

167
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:52,420
you know what Lingam is, right? You could,

168
00:10:52,421 --> 00:10:56,830
you guys look it up like Lingam that's
like, you know, a phallic representation.

169
00:10:56,831 --> 00:11:00,670
So it's like penis. It's the same
thing. And with the means Pearl,

170
00:11:00,671 --> 00:11:04,300
it's actually mother of Pearl.
So yeah, that's exactly,

171
00:11:04,301 --> 00:11:06,100
it's like the hope diamond of penises.

172
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,340
It can be from testing last
name ever or did last name.

173
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:17,710
There we go. So I think the most
logical segue here is to ask you

174
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,180
about bullying during your childhood.

175
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:25,510
We've suffered many of
us through bullying.

176
00:11:25,511 --> 00:11:29,170
And I want to talk about a monkey,

177
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,060
a monkey who stole your birthday cake.

178
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:38,500
Can you explain what, what the Hell
is going on here? How did, yeah,

179
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:40,540
could you please explain
monkey birthday cake story.

180
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,600
I'll do that very quickly because
then it actually comes to one of your

181
00:11:43,601 --> 00:11:46,510
questions that you ask me,
but we just about a strange habit.

182
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,490
So one of my strange habits,

183
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:52,210
unusual habit is that I
like to do something new.

184
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,990
Something I've never before.
I

185
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:56,950
like to try it on my birthday.
And that's a tradition.

186
00:11:56,951 --> 00:12:01,630
It's been everything from like writing
portrait or learning how to snowboard

187
00:12:01,631 --> 00:12:06,230
when I was 45 to fly fishing to uh,

188
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,730
learning to bake beef, Wellington,
right? So it could be anything,

189
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,150
but I've never done it before.
And I did this eye institute,

190
00:12:13,151 --> 00:12:17,350
this is a practice about 15 years ago
because I would always get very depressed

191
00:12:17,351 --> 00:12:21,280
on my birthday cause what happened
on my birthday was that very,

192
00:12:21,281 --> 00:12:25,080
there's a long story, I have to do it very
short. So very quick version is no, no,

193
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:27,910
no quick version. It doesn't have to be
sure. It's all, they're five years old.

194
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:32,980
We just moved from Sri Lanka to Sierra
Leone, west Africa and not just in town.

195
00:12:32,981 --> 00:12:33,880
We were like in the,

196
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:37,210
in the bush and the country like
way out there and my mother,

197
00:12:37,211 --> 00:12:40,180
amazingly I get so in Sri Lanka
I was like a little prince.

198
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:43,870
I had these amazing cakes like you
know, battleship cake, you know,

199
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,810
entire zoo cake.
I mean it was like that kind of cake.

200
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:50,930
Then we went to Sierra Leone and my
mother and we had to the sort of fleas,

201
00:12:50,931 --> 00:12:54,340
Sri Lanka in the middle of the night, you
know, because of trouble in the country.

202
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:56,890
And my mom actually packed,
which is amazing.

203
00:12:56,891 --> 00:13:01,891
I think back on it like a pound of flour
and like icing sugar because we came to

204
00:13:02,321 --> 00:13:06,610
Sierra Leon on December 4th and my
birthday was on December 26th and she knew

205
00:13:06,611 --> 00:13:10,660
this and so out there in the middle
of the jungle, she baked me a cake.

206
00:13:10,661 --> 00:13:14,590
It was a simple little round
cake with chocolate frosting,

207
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:17,770
which is like the simplest frosting
you can. They get right basically.

208
00:13:17,771 --> 00:13:21,520
You can make it almost
anywhere and I didn't like it,
so I was crying as weeping.

209
00:13:21,521 --> 00:13:25,150
I was unhappy about it. My mother
mentioned got tired. She said, you know,

210
00:13:25,151 --> 00:13:27,520
like that's it. I'm, here's
the cake, put it on the table.

211
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:32,670
She goes in to take a bath and I kind
of stopped crying as you do when you're

212
00:13:33,131 --> 00:13:37,150
five and no one's watching. And I walk
into the living room and are the corner,

213
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,650
my eye catch a glimpse of something.

214
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:43,660
I turn and look and there's a monkey
and the monkey is holding my cake as a

215
00:13:43,721 --> 00:13:45,090
monkey. Look to me. I look at the monkey,

216
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:49,630
we're both like the monkeys and then it
jumps and jumps on the window sill in

217
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:54,020
fleas. It like goes, gone. And I'd
go screening and the cake like, hey,

218
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:59,440
this, that kind of thing. My mom comes
out, she's like, warrior petrified.

219
00:13:59,441 --> 00:14:03,370
She'd only been the country for a few
days, that point, like 22 days shaking me.

220
00:14:03,371 --> 00:14:06,190
She's like, are you okay? Are you
okay? Like the cake, the cake cake,

221
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:09,240
she goes to the window,
she goes,

222
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:11,650
no cake that she goes
to the window and uh,

223
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:15,270
houses on stilts to avoid flooding
in the, in the rain forest. And,

224
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:20,370
and she looks down and the cake is down
there and she turns to me and she says,

225
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,890
you wicked wicked child.

226
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,090
Your birthday is cancelled forever.
We will never do birthday again.

227
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,040
Just wait til your father comes home. And
that was it. And now I'm on the floor.

228
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:39,490
I'm like, because the free child
injustice is like the worst thing ever.

229
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:44,920
So since then, like birthdays have
been really, really difficult for me.

230
00:14:44,921 --> 00:14:48,550
It's awesome. December 26 was not
great in our for lots of reasons.

231
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:53,270
And so it creates this gigantic of
anxiety. It's never good enough.

232
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:58,220
Carry right into adulthood. It was very,
very destructive to everyone around me.

233
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,730
And even today, by the way, too, by the
way, when we get together with my family,

234
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:06,080
even today, there is discussion about
whether I threw the cake out the window

235
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:11,120
and the power of story to end.
This is what's happened to my mind.

236
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:14,860
I start thinking,
did I really see that monkey or did I ask,

237
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,310
I don't even know after a while
with this sort of interesting.

238
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,260
So anyway, that's a very long story, but
that's it. All right, that is a great

239
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,293
story.

240
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,230
I want to hear the monkeys version
of that story at some point.

241
00:15:34,231 --> 00:15:37,530
I'll check that monkey down.
That'll be really awkward podcast.

242
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:40,560
How did your parents,

243
00:15:40,561 --> 00:15:43,320
or how did your family end up going
to Sierra Leone of all places?

244
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,620
My Dad got a tax in the middle of
the night, you know, my parents are,

245
00:15:46,621 --> 00:15:50,910
the mildest is amicus banded Asians.
You can possibly meet.

246
00:15:50,911 --> 00:15:54,450
My Dad's an accountant and you know,
he never,

247
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,380
like even now when I travel,

248
00:15:56,381 --> 00:16:01,381
no Matt in Botswana or Namibia
or Indonesia or Colorado,

249
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:06,180
aspen, the same advice. Don't
talk to strangers, be careful
what you eat, you know,

250
00:16:06,181 --> 00:16:10,110
like call. It gets the same kind
of like meek capital advice.

251
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:14,010
But they had this one
gigantic moment of courage,

252
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:18,120
which I still don't understand because
even today it would get massive deal to

253
00:16:18,121 --> 00:16:19,290
do,
but these,

254
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:23,610
these Asians who never have left
the country decided to pick,

255
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
pick up the five year old and one year
old and over weekend decide that the

256
00:16:29,821 --> 00:16:34,821
country was getting politically really
bad and with two suitcases and only the

257
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:39,450
jewelry my mother had just left.
And the only place they,

258
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:44,480
my dad had a job offer was in Sierra
Leone as an accountant for a forestry

259
00:16:44,851 --> 00:16:48,420
company later on.
His career just took off and he did great,

260
00:16:48,421 --> 00:16:53,110
but it just was this unbelievable thing.
And not just the captain,

261
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:56,550
not free town like this is like
where Ebola was like recently, right?

262
00:16:56,551 --> 00:16:59,160
I mean this is where there's
a 30th of a warranty early on.

263
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,170
We didn't just go to the capitol.

264
00:17:01,171 --> 00:17:05,550
We went 200 months in the interior and
lived in like a tree house with quite

265
00:17:05,551 --> 00:17:08,670
literally monkeys obviously around us.

266
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:14,310
And I don't get the, I still ask them then
they're like, yeah, you know, we just,

267
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:17,730
this is a typical age. Like we
didn't have a choice, you know,

268
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:21,660
we just get just like the two lotteries
you, when you know the parents you have,

269
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,690
that's one lottery.
You don't get picked that I won that one.

270
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:27,810
And the country of your birth
is the second lottery. Um,

271
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,870
I sort of snuck into that one,
but those are the two things.

272
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,830
And Steve's completely right. You know,
all of the other things in your life.

273
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:39,630
10 not to matter as much as
those two lotteries that you get.

274
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:46,490
So let's talk about the factors or maybe
if you could describe for us how you

275
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:51,300
ended up in science and then conservation.

276
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:56,720
Yeah, sure. Um, look, I, you know, I
always love nature. I love animals.

277
00:17:56,721 --> 00:17:59,660
I think all kids love nature
and love things that move.

278
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:02,390
And as you get older it kind of
gets beaten out of you. Right?

279
00:18:02,391 --> 00:18:05,330
You just get t stop
encouraging to do that.

280
00:18:05,331 --> 00:18:08,300
But my parents just let me do that because
it's the only thing that was sort of

281
00:18:08,301 --> 00:18:09,134
around me.

282
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:13,880
And I fooled them for a long time
thinking I was pretty mad and kind of went

283
00:18:13,881 --> 00:18:18,881
further and further into that sort of
realm until eventually very late in my

284
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:23,360
sort of Matt, I had my masters
and just getting into my phd,

285
00:18:23,361 --> 00:18:28,361
I sort of realized that there's actually
a career that was actually open to

286
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,980
Asians.
Um,

287
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:35,500
in thinking about the environment and
thinking about conservation and thinking

288
00:18:35,501 --> 00:18:40,501
about actually saving the planet that
you could actually do that respectably.

289
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:43,490
So for most of your life
and be okay with it.

290
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:47,990
It took a lot of convincing for that
bigger family. Just sort of get that,

291
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:50,810
you know, once I got my phd,
I tell a story other than my,

292
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:53,690
you went back to Sri
Lanka and my grandmother,

293
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:57,440
I overheard her telling her
friend who's like across the wall,

294
00:18:57,441 --> 00:19:01,070
I kind of leans over and they have
this conversation. My grandson is back.

295
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,950
He's a doctor now,
but not the kind of saves people

296
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:08,690
and by Greg [inaudible]
has yet to add that. Right.

297
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,880
And I started thinking about
it and I'm like, really?

298
00:19:10,881 --> 00:19:12,740
Isn't that what we're
actually trying to do?

299
00:19:12,741 --> 00:19:14,420
Because ultimately it's all connected.

300
00:19:14,421 --> 00:19:18,320
The people need nature to thrive
and that is one virtuous cycle.

301
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:20,420
But it was a full end game and I bet many,

302
00:19:20,421 --> 00:19:23,960
many people who follow their core
and passion, you know, sort of fuck,

303
00:19:23,961 --> 00:19:28,730
try to find their way to a lot of sort
of fooling around and fooling of other

304
00:19:28,731 --> 00:19:33,020
people, fooling of social circles. I was
just lucky, lucky, lucky enough that,

305
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:38,090
that there was enough there and I finally
realized that I could actually do this.

306
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,720
What was the triggering event
that you were getting at the time?

307
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:48,460
So your masters and phd or in
what, sorry? Where were they?

308
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,430
Are the fields with, what was the, what
was the concentration? I mean it was,

309
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:52,971
you know,

310
00:19:52,971 --> 00:19:57,790
it was biology for my master's and
then wildlife and genetics for my phd.

311
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:01,870
And was there a conversation or a book
or something that proved to you that

312
00:20:01,871 --> 00:20:06,400
conservation could be a path you could
embrace or was it, you know, honestly I,

313
00:20:06,401 --> 00:20:08,650
I wished there was something
like more epic on that.

314
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:13,270
I mean I think there were two moments
in my life where I made these big leaps.

315
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:14,020
Um,

316
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:18,640
the first was coming to America deciding
that I wanted to be here for like

317
00:20:18,641 --> 00:20:22,780
graduate school or like if I my high
education and that was because of Bruce

318
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:25,330
Springsteen kid.
You not that's the kid you not,

319
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,610
that's how we picked colleges back then.
Right.

320
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:31,330
Because you didn't have like I didn't
have like live and have the Internet and I

321
00:20:31,331 --> 00:20:35,230
definitely didn't have any way of knowing
like why America would make sense for

322
00:20:35,231 --> 00:20:38,350
me.
I very little concept of America,

323
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:43,600
but someone gave me that Nebraska album
and I remember looking at the cover of

324
00:20:43,601 --> 00:20:47,680
that album and something about that cover
and something about the way that the

325
00:20:47,681 --> 00:20:52,180
songs in that and the last song on that
album and it just made you want to think

326
00:20:52,181 --> 00:20:56,110
of sort of endless possibilities
and sort of wide open spaces.

327
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,540
And I always felt confined in my life,

328
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:01,660
confined by society or by whatever.

329
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,700
I was always a stranger in a strange land.

330
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:07,750
Well no matter where we move because we
moved around a lot throughout Africa and

331
00:21:07,751 --> 00:21:10,990
sometimes in Asia and I just
felt that that was a big leap,

332
00:21:10,991 --> 00:21:13,480
like taking this sort of
bet to come to America.

333
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:18,970
And then the second one I think had more
to do with, I had an amazing advisor,

334
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:23,770
a guy named Michael Sulay who's like the
father of conservation biology. Really.

335
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,740
He coined that word and he put
it on the map. And you know,

336
00:21:26,741 --> 00:21:31,300
20 years ago he was the guy and I
was lucky enough to work with him.

337
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:32,110
Um,

338
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:35,890
I just cold called him and sort of pester
them until he took me on as a student.

339
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,740
And I think that made me
realize there was a path there.

340
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:43,690
So you mentioned this professor,
could you remind me of his last name?

341
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,480
The pronunciation.

342
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:49,480
Sulay so you leave with that now I've
read that he told you your job as a

343
00:21:49,851 --> 00:21:52,400
graduate student was to train
yourself as a critical thinker.

344
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:57,940
I believe. Maybe that's the
internet line to me again. But uh,

345
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:01,950
so what was true was like,
so I was eager to say things like,

346
00:22:01,951 --> 00:22:05,820
you thought that that's what you did in,
you know, I wanted to go save wildlife.

347
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,830
And he said, no. Right?

348
00:22:07,831 --> 00:22:11,340
Right now your job is to just do
a really good piece of science.

349
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,570
It's actually good advice,

350
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,280
like do a really hard piece of work so
that you'd own it and you'd know that

351
00:22:17,281 --> 00:22:18,750
once in your life you could do that.

352
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:21,180
And there's time enough
later to save things.

353
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:26,190
He tells me now that he might
not have said that advice today,

354
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:29,370
but at that time it made an impression
on me. And that's sort of what I did.

355
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:32,820
Why wouldn't he give that advice
today? Did he explain it? I think he,

356
00:22:32,821 --> 00:22:37,770
I think he is so distraught about what
has happened in the last 20 or 30 years

357
00:22:37,771 --> 00:22:40,410
to our planet. And, and so am I.

358
00:22:40,411 --> 00:22:45,411
And I think we all are really impatient
and I keep waiting for other people to

359
00:22:45,871 --> 00:22:48,480
see something that I have seen in very,

360
00:22:48,481 --> 00:22:52,320
very few people around me somehow
seem to have that gene turned on.

361
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,630
And I think that impatient at what,

362
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:57,420
what sort of makes us
sometimes be irrational,

363
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,220
but other times just feel desperate.

364
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:04,790
So the, the intention,
just to take a step back,

365
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:09,400
so you guys have a better
context here. What are the
no, no, no. What are we doing?

366
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:12,190
That's the question of the evening.
So I initially I was like, you know,

367
00:23:12,191 --> 00:23:15,940
it'd be really fun is to have Steve Case
come up who's in the book and ask him

368
00:23:15,941 --> 00:23:18,370
questions that aren't in the book.
And then to have someone,

369
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:22,240
you come up and ask the
questions that are in the book.

370
00:23:22,241 --> 00:23:25,480
But then of course we got the birthday
cake in the monkey and we're off on a

371
00:23:25,481 --> 00:23:26,440
completely different landscape.

372
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,740
So I'm going to bounce around between
questions that I'm dying to ask.

373
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:32,860
But then the questions that I feel like
it would be fun to sprinkle throughout.

374
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,540
So there's going to be very
little connective tissue.

375
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:36,490
It's gonna be like the worst
edited movie you've ever seen.

376
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:42,850
What purchase of $100 or less has most
positively impacted your life in recent

377
00:23:42,851 --> 00:23:43,684
memory?

378
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:47,840
That's really hard question for me
because I don't buy a lot of stuff.

379
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:51,560
I'm a total snob when it
comes to like the stuff I own.

380
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:56,810
And the reason for that is
because I travel incessantly
and when I travel I just

381
00:23:56,811 --> 00:24:00,620
have one bag and I have to take it to
everything I own has to do like double

382
00:24:00,621 --> 00:24:02,630
duty. And so I'm very, very,

383
00:24:02,631 --> 00:24:07,631
very picky about like I the simplifying
or just taking exactly what I like.

384
00:24:07,941 --> 00:24:12,941
So can't think of something really easy
that comes to mind under 100 bucks.

385
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:17,810
They could just name,
um, icebreaker underwear.

386
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:19,520
So icebreaker is a great company.

387
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:22,760
They produce amazing stuff all
at the marina wall and a wall.

388
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:25,740
You know that New Zealand based company.
I think you and I both know the founder,

389
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,790
um,
and um,

390
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:31,970
Jeremy Moon and I like his
personal ethos and his stuff works.

391
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,880
I don't get paid by this
company or anything like that,

392
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:39,950
but that's probably the
last under a hundred dollars
purchase I made that I love.

393
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:44,410
Do you have a Goto bag?
You mentioned you have one bag.

394
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:48,970
Have you vetted a lot of bad? Yeah, so
I used to love this Victoria Knox bag.

395
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:53,240
They don't make it anymore. So the
problem with it's just kills you, right?

396
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,350
Really kills you.

397
00:24:56,730 --> 00:25:01,030
Like you just figure out that this
something that works really well and then

398
00:25:01,031 --> 00:25:05,410
they go and change it. Like
shoes, like athletic shoes.

399
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:10,030
Oh my God. Did they change it? And
there's a whole race to change it fast.

400
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:13,400
So this is really a hard
question because um,

401
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:17,680
I now use it to me bag and I like
it because I liked the four wheels.

402
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:20,200
I also like the sturdiness of that bag.

403
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:24,980
It's heavy. That's the
downside on it. All right.

404
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,920
But I'm getting older so I can't really
know everything's on my back anymore.

405
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:32,760
I need very specific well
wheel to me. Bag. Do you have,

406
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:37,790
do you have a protocol for surviving or
maintaining your sanity and health for a

407
00:25:39,661 --> 00:25:42,810
really long flights like that flight
from Botswana where I ambushed you with

408
00:25:42,811 --> 00:25:46,510
this invitation. Uh, is there
anything special are you doing?

409
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:51,030
And I know friends who carry céline Mres
for their noses or wrap their heads and

410
00:25:51,031 --> 00:25:54,870
all sorts of weird contraptions to block
out sound and light or do you just go

411
00:25:54,871 --> 00:25:55,320
out

412
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,240
and you're done? No, you know,

413
00:25:57,241 --> 00:26:01,950
I tried to be like as comfortable as
I possibly can during the flight. Um,

414
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,360
I mean it's just the usual stuff.

415
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:05,970
I tried to get myself on
the new time zone fast.

416
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:10,770
I'm very strategic about how when I drink
coffee or anything like coffee or tea,

417
00:26:10,771 --> 00:26:13,920
very strategic about the timing on that.
Um,

418
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:16,440
I tend to fast a little bit on flights.

419
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:20,850
I don't eat a lot just because I can
catch up later and it always makes me feel

420
00:26:20,851 --> 00:26:24,840
a little better. I guess that's sort
of it. Like sometimes you get like,

421
00:26:24,841 --> 00:26:25,950
it depends.
It really,

422
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:29,350
like I did this flight and I'll
be absolutely honest with the,

423
00:26:29,351 --> 00:26:32,370
I fly so much that sometimes I'm flying
in business class, especially very,

424
00:26:32,371 --> 00:26:36,090
very long flight and I have to like
gland there and get into meetings.

425
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,830
Sometimes I find economy,

426
00:26:37,831 --> 00:26:42,831
I did this very long flight from Sydney
to Johannesburg and I'm in the back of

427
00:26:45,151 --> 00:26:50,010
an old seven, four, seven
middle seat with these two.

428
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:54,420
Very nice but large sum on
gentleman by the side of

429
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:59,670
the plane hadn't even really taken off.

430
00:26:59,671 --> 00:27:02,970
They both fell asleep and their
hands kept falling into my lap.

431
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,650
I have fifth and I had to like
lift and put it in there like two.

432
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,600
And you know that kind of
flight you just took Kate,

433
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:13,590
you just have to just completely
do this mind shift. So what you do.

434
00:27:13,591 --> 00:27:16,320
So I stripped all my stuff.
I've got really like into like,

435
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:20,130
you know like you know my jeans and a
tee shirt, you know, sort of curled up,

436
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,500
made my little space and
then start playing this game.

437
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:27,390
So all you have to do is think about what
worst form of interpretation you could

438
00:27:27,391 --> 00:27:32,010
be stuck in that moment. So you just
have to think, well this could be, um,

439
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:36,570
you know, Mombasa too,
you know, like compiler,

440
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:40,140
you know,
truck driver arrived right now in the,

441
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,160
in the back of like a local bus,
you know, and you'd like, Oh my God,

442
00:27:44,161 --> 00:27:47,540
this will be so much better than that.
Like I can like order food,

443
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:50,370
they can get drinks and I mean
like you've got just infinitely,

444
00:27:50,371 --> 00:27:53,520
infinitely better, infinitely
better. So that's the trick.

445
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:57,750
Like I once had to spend an entire
month in a very small cabin on a book,

446
00:27:57,810 --> 00:28:01,650
no windows. It's a research vessel and
stuck in there with another roommate,

447
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:05,520
tiny for a month and I,
and we had food,

448
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:08,310
literally cans of food under our bed.
That's how small the whole,

449
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:13,320
but I kept thinking this is like a
sleeper suite on Singapore Airlines,

450
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:18,420
like $20,000 ticket right now because
I can sleep, there's a shower.

451
00:28:18,421 --> 00:28:21,570
Like I can walk around and it just
makes you feel so much better.

452
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,350
That's the trick with distance.
Anytime the space constraint,

453
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:30,240
just think of what's worse and then
just mine shift. It works. No though.

454
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:34,160
Exit. It sounds like a fantastic trick.
Uh, I'm still thinking about this, the,

455
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,330
the thicks of on hands
learning and their loud.

456
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,750
If you were to be,
we're talking about

457
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:43,060
your mentors and the advice he gave you.
If,

458
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:47,740
if you were to have the opportunity
to teach, say give you three options,

459
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,680
a ninth grade class,
college,

460
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:53,700
freshmen class or college senior class,

461
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:58,270
you choose one of those three and to
teach a seminar or class of your choosing,

462
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:02,440
what age would you choose and what
would you teach? You have a semester.

463
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:06,280
So tell me again how old people are at
ninth grade. Cause I didn't go to school.

464
00:29:06,281 --> 00:29:11,020
It's grades 1514,
15 I would say a 14 program.

465
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:16,730
I probably teach that
freshman seminar class,

466
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:17,803
Freshmen College,

467
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:22,010
freshmen college because I think I
have relatable experiences that I can

468
00:29:22,011 --> 00:29:24,170
translate to that group.

469
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:28,280
And it's still early enough for that
trajectory to make a big difference.

470
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:31,800
So that's probably why
I picked that group. Um,

471
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:36,890
and what would I teach? Yeah. What would
the class be? And it doesn't have to be,

472
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:41,920
there's no prereq. There's no like
be like, how to get shit done or like

473
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:44,890
this is a good, this is a
good subject. It's like,

474
00:29:44,891 --> 00:29:48,400
it's like so much stuff that we
learned in college is wasted.

475
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:52,140
I think he just think about
the vast amount of stuff
that they taught us that we

476
00:29:52,141 --> 00:29:56,120
never ever actually use like that.
So I would love to look.

477
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:00,180
I would probably teach a class and like
being really honest because I do teach

478
00:30:00,181 --> 00:30:00,841
at university.

479
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:04,260
So probably would be something
about biology and something
about the environment.

480
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:07,310
Right? So chances are it'll
be in that thing. It might be,

481
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,540
it might be a class in communication.

482
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:13,320
So cause I've done like enough television
work and stuff like that to be able to

483
00:30:13,321 --> 00:30:17,880
do that legitimately. So, um, but,

484
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,390
or storytelling, but I would
probably teach a class in biology,

485
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:26,130
but if I really could get away with it,
I would do something like, you know,

486
00:30:26,131 --> 00:30:31,131
like all of the things you wish you'd
known getting into this or how to organize

487
00:30:31,591 --> 00:30:35,530
your life to get stuff done. You
know, be kind of in that vein.

488
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:40,170
It's just basically take some of
your books. Cribbet regurgitate it.

489
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:45,510
So I want to ask both about the
getting shit done. Freshman seminar.

490
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:50,400
No, no, no. But let, let's just as a
thought exercise, if it were instead,

491
00:30:50,401 --> 00:30:53,250
just so you don't have to think
about the entire semester.

492
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:58,251
If it were just a three to four hours
seminar and what would be some of the key

493
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:04,860
principles or strategies or anything
that you would want to hammer home?

494
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:11,100
Um, you, you're getting me out to a
really long flight. So it's my brand.

495
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:14,560
Well you can also buy some time by
asking you what you would teach in a

496
00:31:14,561 --> 00:31:17,140
storytelling class.
So none of whites stay with the

497
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:23,120
or? No, I'm kidding. All right, so,

498
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,880
so the,
what was the question again?

499
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:30,910
The question was if you have a three to
four hour seminar on getting shit done.

500
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:32,680
Yeah.
What are some of the,

501
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:38,460
any of the key messages or strategies
or anything that you would emphasize?

502
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,110
So, um, cause you get a lot done. I mean,

503
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:49,111
I've observed how much you
do and it boggles my mind.

504
00:31:49,781 --> 00:31:53,270
I don't know how you, yes. So, so the, the

505
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:56,190
look, you know, there's some,

506
00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:00,530
some of the principles that you'd
probably want to try to get into is um,

507
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:06,180
you know, dealing with focus,
right? So this is a major challenge,

508
00:32:06,181 --> 00:32:10,290
especially for younger, younger people
and it's not getting any better.

509
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,410
And I have the ability,
right?

510
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:16,920
And it's not because I have some magical
abilities because he's just practice it

511
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:22,080
of intensely focusing on one thing for
a few seconds or for a few minutes.

512
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:27,660
And I think that ability to intensely
focus on something and not be distracted

513
00:32:27,661 --> 00:32:30,510
from anything else,
it's a very useful habit to have.

514
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:34,830
And so I'm very good at one, like when
you're one on one, you can be one on one.

515
00:32:34,831 --> 00:32:37,890
It can be very focused.
And I think that's true for storytelling.

516
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:40,850
And that's true for getting
information out of people.

517
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:46,150
And I think helping people focusing on
one thing and then switching to another.

518
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:51,390
So it's a series of focus is a
very, very useful practice. Um,

519
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:52,840
I think that,
you know,

520
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:57,850
we waste enormous amount
of time pretending to work
and we can just sort of get

521
00:32:58,281 --> 00:33:02,510
rid of that whole thing. I think we, um,

522
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:06,530
I think we're not honest with ourselves
about what we're really good at and what

523
00:33:06,531 --> 00:33:11,531
we're not good at and in the very early
success to as being absolutely brutally

524
00:33:12,141 --> 00:33:16,070
honest at what you're not good at and
you can compensate for it to some ways,

525
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:19,520
but just don't like you ask people,
so what do you think you're good at?

526
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,520
And they'll sort of tell you their resume
or they'll recite you. That sort of,

527
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,850
and that's not particularly useful.
Um,

528
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:29,090
I'll tell them about the
things that I wish I had done.

529
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,930
I think every student that going through
should, should take a class in ethics.

530
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:38,170
I think every student going through
should take a class on communications and

531
00:33:38,331 --> 00:33:39,164
storytelling.

532
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:44,570
I think every student who goes through
should think about how during their four

533
00:33:44,571 --> 00:33:46,730
year or three,
whatever their college term is,

534
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,950
spending a little time working on a,

535
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:54,070
on something that is completely unrelated
to their primary area of interest.

536
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:59,540
That was probably the best thing I
ever did when I was going through the

537
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:04,340
American education system is that during
the summers I was restricted on what

538
00:34:04,341 --> 00:34:06,140
jobs I could do because
I was a foreign student.

539
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:10,610
I would go and work at the World Bank
and for a biologist to be walking around

540
00:34:10,611 --> 00:34:15,140
at the World Bank was a very strange
thing at the time and it was unbelievably

541
00:34:15,141 --> 00:34:19,730
useful to me. It was like the most useful
thing I did. Really. Why was it useful?

542
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:23,450
Because it just put me in touch with a
whole bunch of people who were completely

543
00:34:23,451 --> 00:34:27,640
unlike me and it was about the world in
a completely different terms and go in

544
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:30,350
there and be like, you must
be an economist. I'm like,
no, I'm a wildlife biologist.

545
00:34:30,351 --> 00:34:34,640
And they'd be like, wow, that's crazy.
What are you doing here? And, but we,

546
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:39,590
but I just started realizing how they
worked and how a whole different set of

547
00:34:39,591 --> 00:34:44,360
rules apply and how a whole nother
institution was working on problems,

548
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:48,410
you know? And just, it just
opened my eyes. It just opened my,

549
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:52,370
these things would have been for me to
go work for a nonprofit like the one I

550
00:34:52,371 --> 00:34:55,970
work for now, a contribution sash on
the age of consent. He didn't do that.

551
00:34:56,270 --> 00:35:01,270
I really particularly went and got
jobs in areas that had nothing,

552
00:35:01,521 --> 00:35:04,790
nothing to do with my
primary area of interest.

553
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:07,580
Just to see what it
looked like and the best,

554
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,240
the funnest things in the world
are all on those angles, right?

555
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,630
When you can bring two
different fields together, this,

556
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:17,810
there's so much gold in those angles.
You do that all the time actually,

557
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,830
and I've really,
you know,

558
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:24,530
learning how to exploit that is often
your little trick to getting a headstart

559
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:30,420
and makes me think also of career advice
that I've heard from both Scott Adams,

560
00:35:32,751 --> 00:35:37,160
creator of Dilbert and also
mark Andreessen in different
senses, but they've said

561
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:41,080
this is more Scott Adams
and his writing that there,

562
00:35:41,081 --> 00:35:45,150
there are different ways
to quote unquote succeed.

563
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:49,560
One is you can try to be, say top 1% of
1% like a Michael Jordan in one skill.

564
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:50,550
That's really, really, really,

565
00:35:50,551 --> 00:35:55,130
really difficult of the other approaches
that you could be saying the top 10% in

566
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:58,680
two typically uncombined areas,
right?

567
00:35:58,681 --> 00:36:03,330
So you have Scott Adams who, who say
himself, he's not the best artist,

568
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:04,890
he's not the best comedian,

569
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:09,400
but he's unusually good at
combining both of those things. Uh,

570
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:10,800
and in the world of business,

571
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:14,820
it could be say a JD plus
computer science or softer skills.

572
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:19,620
And I've heard Warren buffet talk
about his best ever investment being,

573
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:24,810
I believe it was toastmasters or some
equivalent public speaking course,

574
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:29,990
cause you layer that on top of almost
anything and it automatically puts you in

575
00:36:30,571 --> 00:36:35,100
a position to have a really
unfair advantage. So storytelling,

576
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:39,690
you were kind enough, we were
trading some notes before this. Uh,

577
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:40,830
and you mentioned storytelling.

578
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:43,830
So this is one thing I highlighted
of notes that you sent to me,

579
00:36:43,831 --> 00:36:47,070
which was storytelling is one
way to rule the world. Uh,

580
00:36:47,071 --> 00:36:50,850
and another friend of mine who's
been on the podcast, Chris Saka,

581
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:55,440
who's just an incredible investor,
hilarious guy,

582
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:56,360
but the,

583
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:01,400
he originally trained to be lawyer and
he was beaten soundly at one point by

584
00:37:02,701 --> 00:37:06,270
this guy who got up after Chris had
presented all of his spreadsheets and all

585
00:37:06,271 --> 00:37:10,200
the data and some guy got up, I think it
was in Arkansas or Texas or somewhere,

586
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:13,410
and he was like, well, you know,
you can't lead a horse to water.

587
00:37:13,411 --> 00:37:16,750
It's something he just started speaking
in like five or six different, uh,

588
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,430
parables and completely
kicked Chris's ass.

589
00:37:20,431 --> 00:37:25,160
And so Chris concluded that story's
beat spreadsheets. Uh, it's,

590
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:30,230
how have you developed your ability to
tell stories or how would you recommend

591
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:35,280
people develop perhaps a books,

592
00:37:35,281 --> 00:37:39,480
tools, practices, the ability
to tell better stories?

593
00:37:39,481 --> 00:37:44,250
Because I think it's as, as
you've said, so, so, so powerful.

594
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:50,550
Right? So I, so I really agree with
what you just said and I think, um,

595
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:54,510
I think storytelling is one really
powerful way to kind of rule the world.

596
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:58,410
And a lot of people that we kind of look
up to and think about like, you know,

597
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:03,240
from Einstein to Elon Musk to um,
Steve jobs,

598
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:06,450
they were really powerful
storytellers in their own way, right?

599
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:11,451
So they had this ability through words
or through images to really convince you

600
00:38:11,761 --> 00:38:15,770
that you could do something that no one
else could, could, could think about.

601
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:19,860
And that just that mind ship that they
created propelled you along with their

602
00:38:19,861 --> 00:38:22,920
vision and all of a sudden you
were doing it. So, and you can,

603
00:38:22,921 --> 00:38:26,100
you can absolutely learn those skills.
You can actually get better at it.

604
00:38:26,101 --> 00:38:30,630
So when I was in high school, I was
painfully shy, like painfully shy,

605
00:38:30,631 --> 00:38:35,410
were very thick glass, had long hair. I
did get the nap all the time. Um, it was,

606
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:38,110
it was,
I went to school for my high school.

607
00:38:38,111 --> 00:38:41,500
I went to school and it was like
Hogwarts without any of the magic

608
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:51,010
and he was really a step.
But I had a break and the break was,

609
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:54,400
this is such a funny brick. So I was
sent to boarding school in England.

610
00:38:54,401 --> 00:38:58,300
This is an England for a year. And the
break was that we had a debate team,

611
00:38:58,301 --> 00:39:01,120
which is quite good and it would go up
against like eaten and all the other

612
00:39:01,121 --> 00:39:05,470
schools like that. And the kid who
was supposed to be like the OT,

613
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:07,900
the main kid for this debate team,
you know,

614
00:39:07,901 --> 00:39:12,901
got ill and they suggested
that I fill that role.

615
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:17,710
Um,
and I did and you know,

616
00:39:17,711 --> 00:39:20,050
I really had to the first time
where I did this, you know,

617
00:39:20,051 --> 00:39:23,310
they make fun of my accent
because I had a bit of an accent.

618
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:24,970
I didn't actually have much of an accent,

619
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:28,540
but in their minds I had a
very strong Asian accent.

620
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:33,790
And what I did was I started the
debate with that very, very strong.

621
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:37,900
I just overemphasized. Everyone
laughed at me. I laughed at myself.

622
00:39:37,901 --> 00:39:42,040
I got over it and I moved on.
That's not a big deal to do today,

623
00:39:42,041 --> 00:39:44,230
but when you're 14 or 15,

624
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:47,170
it feels big and scary
and really hard to do.

625
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:50,020
And I realized that there
was power in that by the way.

626
00:39:50,021 --> 00:39:52,750
We went all the way to the finals
and this kid. Then got well,

627
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:56,200
and then they kicked me off the team.
And then this kid actually lost,

628
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:01,090
not saying anything here,
but this is exactly what that literally,

629
00:40:01,091 --> 00:40:05,260
I like three debates, three rounds,
like we were, we were doing fine.

630
00:40:05,261 --> 00:40:07,280
The team was doing great. Okay. Um,

631
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:12,220
he had chicken pox and then he was out
of corn time so you could come back on

632
00:40:12,221 --> 00:40:16,540
the team and then I was
off. Um, okay. So you can't,

633
00:40:16,541 --> 00:40:17,740
you can't practice.
You can get better.

634
00:40:17,741 --> 00:40:20,740
So I practice and I think about it and
I think about how people tell stories.

635
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:24,610
I even Tim, like you've looked at Tim's,
what you open that first couple of pages,

636
00:40:24,611 --> 00:40:28,690
he talks to that little story that he puts
in there about, you know, you, you know,

637
00:40:28,691 --> 00:40:32,590
what he was grappling with in his
college days immediately captivates.

638
00:40:32,591 --> 00:40:35,860
You just immediately want to
know more and read more, right?

639
00:40:35,861 --> 00:40:40,090
So there's real power there. Um, and
you can develop and get better at it.

640
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:42,970
So what are some of the ways
in which you can do this?

641
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:48,120
So you have to be genuinely interested
in the stories you're telling.

642
00:40:48,261 --> 00:40:51,460
You can't fake that.
Like if you're interviewing someone,

643
00:40:51,461 --> 00:40:53,320
you've got to be actually
a fan of that person.

644
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:56,770
Even if you're not a fan of
that topic or that person,

645
00:40:56,771 --> 00:41:00,610
or not genuinely interested,
it's just not gonna work, right?

646
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:04,090
You got to own that story. It's gotta
be all, you can't bluff the story.

647
00:41:04,091 --> 00:41:05,770
It can't kind of lie about it.

648
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,680
You can learn a story and
repeat someone else's story,

649
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:13,390
but you really have to own it in
like a deep, deep sense of it.

650
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:18,280
Um, you have to know when to stop. Uh,

651
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:22,120
you have to know when to, you know,
the messengers are so important, right?

652
00:41:22,121 --> 00:41:24,670
So there's something I often
say it is not just the story,

653
00:41:24,671 --> 00:41:28,300
but it's also the kind of stories you
tell and they have to be true to who you

654
00:41:28,301 --> 00:41:31,270
are as a, as a storyteller. So look this,

655
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:34,220
I'm not a professional
like teaching people

656
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:38,690
how to tell stories. I can't do that
professionally. I know I do it in my,

657
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,790
I practice it,
I got it from my parents.

658
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:43,400
I think it's a wonderful
craft to think about,

659
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:48,490
read books and read books and figure out
what piece of that is really catching

660
00:41:48,531 --> 00:41:50,630
your heart.
It always starts with the heart.

661
00:41:50,631 --> 00:41:54,740
It always come from place of
commonality and laughter and love or,

662
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:58,850
or pain or something from the heart
before you can engage the mind.

663
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:01,280
And that those sorts of
stories always tend to win.

664
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:06,740
So want to underscore something you
said then I want to ask about this very,

665
00:42:06,741 --> 00:42:07,710
very,
uh,

666
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:11,150
clear smirk that came on your face when
you just said something a second ago.

667
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:12,890
But,
uh,

668
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:18,580
I think the going for the
heart or noticing what
captures the heart applies to

669
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:21,140
questions too. So, uh, for instance,

670
00:42:21,141 --> 00:42:25,220
a cal Fussman who was one
of the main writers of the,

671
00:42:25,221 --> 00:42:28,130
what I learned column and Esquire
for a long, long, long time,

672
00:42:28,131 --> 00:42:31,580
I want to say 10 plus years interviewed
Gorbachev and all these people routinely

673
00:42:31,581 --> 00:42:34,910
would get told right before an interview.
Yeah, this hour long interview,

674
00:42:34,911 --> 00:42:36,080
you now have five minutes.

675
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:41,410
And so you would have to hook someone
like Gorbey into continuing to talk and

676
00:42:41,631 --> 00:42:43,370
you'd think about his questions.
And then he'd say, you know,

677
00:42:43,371 --> 00:42:48,371
tell me about when your father left for
war and was there any particular lesson

678
00:42:48,741 --> 00:42:49,161
he taught you?

679
00:42:49,161 --> 00:42:54,161
And he would go for the emotion first
and that would then allow him to get to

680
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:57,090
the headier questions
later. So I think that, uh,

681
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:00,560
it applies to not only the telling
of stories, but the asking,

682
00:43:00,561 --> 00:43:05,330
the eliciting of stories and
good storytelling is that
right? So in a good story,

683
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:09,710
a really phenomenal story is one way you
actually are having this relationship

684
00:43:09,711 --> 00:43:10,311
with their audience.

685
00:43:10,311 --> 00:43:14,390
And it's a two way story when
p and people do that magically,

686
00:43:14,391 --> 00:43:16,880
you're at a whole nother
kind of level of it.

687
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:20,840
And like when you talk about how you
organize your questions, you know,

688
00:43:20,841 --> 00:43:22,940
it sounds so simple, like, okay,

689
00:43:22,941 --> 00:43:26,060
he's got a bunch of questions that there's
so much thought going into it because

690
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:27,530
you're actually engaging a story.

691
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:31,400
You're doing it in that way so that you
can get the whole thing kind of coming

692
00:43:31,401 --> 00:43:34,740
out. Right? Yeah,
absolutely. And, uh, the,

693
00:43:34,741 --> 00:43:36,620
the piece that I wanted to ask about it,

694
00:43:36,621 --> 00:43:39,860
and maybe it was just because you
enjoy smiling and do it so well,

695
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:44,240
but you said you have to know when to
stop and then you may thing yet this big

696
00:43:44,241 --> 00:43:48,920
grin on your face. Maybe that was just
me noticing something that wasn't there,

697
00:43:48,921 --> 00:43:50,960
but what's,

698
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:54,140
what's behind knowing when to
stop or like what's the opposite?

699
00:43:54,141 --> 00:43:56,750
What does that look like? Just telling
a long story that goes on too long.

700
00:43:57,270 --> 00:44:02,180
The best storytellers leave you wanting
to hear more best comedians just

701
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:06,590
absolutely we leave you wanting to
hear more. There's a real art to that.

702
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:10,190
You can't give it all away.
You have to leave the audience saying,

703
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:13,140
I wanted to hear like tell me more.
Like,

704
00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:18,290
and that's really important about knowing
when to be able to stop and you can

705
00:44:18,951 --> 00:44:22,220
always explain things
many, many ways. And I'm,

706
00:44:22,430 --> 00:44:25,460
I'm really not particularly today by
the ways and then in my apologizing a

707
00:44:25,461 --> 00:44:28,730
little bit for that. But that's
a really important skill to know.

708
00:44:28,731 --> 00:44:32,160
Like when does that story end?
Don't bury the punchline,

709
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,370
you know, like, you know,

710
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:37,650
like so many times it's like there's a
whole windup where I'm going to tell you

711
00:44:37,651 --> 00:44:42,210
now a story about a monkey
that stole Mike. Don't do
that. Just go right into it.

712
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:46,110
Like, cause you have them at the first
minute and then at every minute after that

713
00:44:46,111 --> 00:44:47,690
you're going to start
losing audience shares.

714
00:44:47,691 --> 00:44:52,020
So you want to get it fast and get
right into, into it as fast as you can.

715
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:57,540
So I want to talk about, uh, by the way,
can I tell you one thing about that?

716
00:44:57,670 --> 00:45:00,440
Because I just think yes,
of course. So, you know,

717
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:04,260
when I was talking about the message and
the message about owning your story, go,

718
00:45:04,261 --> 00:45:06,090
go do this. When you get a
chance, when you get home,

719
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:11,700
you know that song respect re res Pct,

720
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:15,740
you know that song, right? Yeah. So
who sang that? Right at the Franklin?

721
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:19,250
Everyone knows who read the fine grain
or everyone can like Hammad right now if

722
00:45:19,251 --> 00:45:20,940
I played it to, you know, in a heartbeat,

723
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:23,130
but she's not the one who's
actually first sang it.

724
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:27,690
It's actually done by Otis Redding.
Same words, same song, very different.

725
00:45:27,691 --> 00:45:31,390
Meaning the song is really like
exact opposite of where they are.

726
00:45:31,391 --> 00:45:36,030
Either makes that song to be
Otis Redding Song. It's like,

727
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:37,141
you know,

728
00:45:37,141 --> 00:45:41,910
I'm working all day woman and I'm like
putting food on the table for you.

729
00:45:41,911 --> 00:45:44,890
And like when I fucking come
home, I'm so sorry. I said Duh.

730
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:52,470
When I come home all I want is just
like some goddamn respect. Right.

731
00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:57,060
That's his song. Never made it big. But
all his writing was a big singer by then.

732
00:45:57,330 --> 00:46:01,380
A decent song, decent
blue songs. She owned it.

733
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:07,010
She complete same words but just
the way she put that story together,

734
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:12,560
her complete ownership of it and who will
forget her spelling of that just makes

735
00:46:14,281 --> 00:46:17,430
her like mix of the one who
remembers it and later on in life,

736
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:21,900
Otis actually sort of kind of
complaints slightly about about her,

737
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:25,530
like taking the song and making it
so huge and no one remembers that.

738
00:46:25,531 --> 00:46:30,240
He's the one who recorded it and sang it
and performed it for at least two years

739
00:46:30,241 --> 00:46:34,560
before she came along. So just you
want to hear, seek two stories,

740
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:39,660
same story, told in different ways.
Listen to those two songs. That's amazing.

741
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:40,620
I had no idea.

742
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:44,760
I want to talk about some of the stories
and the stories may not be the right

743
00:46:44,761 --> 00:46:47,520
word,
but narratives that have stuck with you.

744
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:51,240
And I'm going to prompt with a question
and I can certainly cheat a little bit

745
00:46:51,241 --> 00:46:51,781
in prompt,

746
00:46:51,781 --> 00:46:56,400
but what is the book or books you've
given the most as a gift and why,

747
00:46:56,670 --> 00:46:59,070
or books that have
influenced you? Yeah, we,

748
00:46:59,110 --> 00:47:01,110
Tim and I have talked about
this a little bit. So for me,

749
00:47:01,111 --> 00:47:05,730
books are like all about the moment in
the motion that I'm in and the person I'm

750
00:47:05,731 --> 00:47:07,110
giving it to.
It is an,

751
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:12,060
and so I can't tell you that there's one
book that has predominated how I give,

752
00:47:12,061 --> 00:47:15,990
because I love books and I love to
give books and I carry books around.

753
00:47:15,991 --> 00:47:19,650
And even today I brought two books for
you to autograph that I'm giving away.

754
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:22,370
Right?
So there's an act of giving and that,

755
00:47:22,371 --> 00:47:26,640
and that in a book is a wonderful way
to convey something to another person.

756
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:32,410
Um, books that I've loved giving away. Um,
Norman Maclean's river runs through it.

757
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:35,440
I read that book in so many
different ways and so many pieces.

758
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:40,390
It totally influenced my life in terms
of fly fishing and finding sort of magic

759
00:47:40,391 --> 00:47:42,400
and words,
that quiet space.

760
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:45,490
You also wrote that book
when he was 71 years old.

761
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:48,760
Kind of really the only
big book he wrote said 71.

762
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:52,810
And you think about all this bullshit
about like creative genius being in the

763
00:47:52,811 --> 00:47:53,980
young and all of that.

764
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:58,000
As you get older you start appreciating
that if Norman could do it at 71,

765
00:47:58,001 --> 00:48:02,310
maybe I could do it like, you
know, not quite at 71 yet. Um,

766
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,870
another book I really liked,
um,

767
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:07,720
more recent book is Stanley
Mcchrystal's team of teams.

768
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:10,420
Completely different reason.
Just a really clever,

769
00:48:10,421 --> 00:48:15,421
smart book about how to
organize businesses and
enterprises for today's world.

770
00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:19,010
And he takes us in sort of
experience from the army and in, in,

771
00:48:19,011 --> 00:48:21,280
in Afghanistan and sort of,
you know,

772
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:26,340
and brings it over to sort of to your
life or my life and makes it kind of

773
00:48:26,501 --> 00:48:30,400
relevant and meaningful. I found
it very influential. Um, I,

774
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:35,200
I've given away a quite a few
copies of James Nester's book,

775
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:39,950
the deep joy. You might have read,
write, read his, haven't read the deer.

776
00:48:39,951 --> 00:48:42,670
That book is pretty damn good.
It's about, it's about free diving.

777
00:48:43,010 --> 00:48:46,240
I knew nothing about and that was,
that was one of my birthday things.

778
00:48:46,241 --> 00:48:47,830
That was like two years ago.

779
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:51,220
So I thought I'd tried the spray down in
him because I read an estrous book and

780
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:56,140
it's amazing the physiology of the human
body and what it can do is amazing.

781
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,990
So I read this book,
it's about free diving and very scary,

782
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:01,240
very sort of can be very dangerous sport,

783
00:49:01,241 --> 00:49:05,680
but also an amazing sport because it
completely changes the way you think about

784
00:49:05,681 --> 00:49:08,980
your body and what you're capable of.
And I thought, what, right this is,

785
00:49:08,981 --> 00:49:12,080
this book inspired me. I'm going to
go try and take a lesson in freedom.

786
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:16,840
So went to Hawaii around my birthday and
I took a lesson from a very, very good,

787
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:19,390
you want to do this with someone
very, very good. And I did.

788
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:23,610
And this woman's Shelly Eisenberg, who
was my teacher for the day, you know,

789
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:26,800
basically, look, this is what
she did. Within three hours,

790
00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:31,060
I can hold my breath for like
maybe 45 seconds, maybe a minute.

791
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:33,880
I tried within three hours,

792
00:49:34,570 --> 00:49:39,100
three hours just by doing exercises
with me. She had me at two minutes,

793
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:42,730
10 seconds.
That floored me.

794
00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:46,090
It'd be like saying how fast can
you run it and be like, okay,

795
00:49:46,091 --> 00:49:47,980
I can do like a nine minute mile.
And you saying,

796
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:51,190
well give me three hours and I
get you down to like a six minute.

797
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:56,110
Like he just couldn't do that and that.
And she's like,

798
00:49:56,111 --> 00:49:58,770
yeah, like let's keep going. And
like sure enough, you know, the new,

799
00:49:58,771 --> 00:49:59,920
you're doing three minutes,

800
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,910
three minutes within
24 hours under yeoman.

801
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:07,570
True story can do it.
Everyone in here can do that too.

802
00:50:07,870 --> 00:50:10,060
That's why that book was
so kind of mentally be

803
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:10,893
transformative.

804
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:16,970
I feel obligated as the person who,
certainly not a doctor,

805
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:18,650
and you've heard this before,
I don't play one on the Internet,

806
00:50:18,651 --> 00:50:22,340
but you have to be very, very careful
with this type of training. Uh,

807
00:50:22,370 --> 00:50:26,930
so do not do take the DIY
approach. Uh, I know people,

808
00:50:26,931 --> 00:50:30,680
I know people who have died and I know
people who have come very close to dying

809
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:34,400
from shallow water blackouts. And
when you, depending on the technique,

810
00:50:34,401 --> 00:50:36,590
if you blow off a lot of CO2,

811
00:50:37,370 --> 00:50:40,090
you won't sense that you're going
to black out before you blackout.

812
00:50:40,690 --> 00:50:42,110
You're fine and then you're blacked out.

813
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:46,070
But you don't really want to have
happen in any amount of water. Right.

814
00:50:46,071 --> 00:50:50,120
You could Jimi Hendrix herself or it
could be in a thousand feet of water,

815
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:53,210
same outcome. So be very, very
careful only with supervision.

816
00:50:53,211 --> 00:50:54,230
But it is fascinating.

817
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:54,431
Yeah.

818
00:50:54,431 --> 00:50:59,290
I mean two navy seals drowned
in a training exercise in
San Diego like two years

819
00:50:59,291 --> 00:51:00,124
ago.
Yeah.

820
00:51:00,130 --> 00:51:03,990
Just the two of them just trying this
out and breaking the rules of that.

821
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,810
The number one thing with this is just
like you're doing it with a buddy who can

822
00:51:07,811 --> 00:51:10,060
do this better than you can and,
and,

823
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:12,640
and she goes and you
definitely want to do this.

824
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:15,310
And that's why I didn't just
try this. Yeah. I read his book.

825
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:19,330
Then I went and got like one of the
best teachers and I spent time with her.

826
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:20,830
And that's why I think it's

827
00:51:20,930 --> 00:51:25,230
thanks billboards. Let's talk about them.

828
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:29,310
If you could have a giant billboard
anywhere with anything on it,

829
00:51:29,810 --> 00:51:34,590
Bill Billboard with a message you would
get out to millions or billions of

830
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:36,120
people,
what would it say and why?

831
00:51:36,330 --> 00:51:38,640
Um, I'm going to take an
easy one out, but yeah,

832
00:51:38,641 --> 00:51:43,230
I'm going to use one of the slogans that
we at conservation international use in

833
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:45,870
some ways,
which I would probably say something like,

834
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:50,670
either people need nature
that's not obvious enough.

835
00:51:50,671 --> 00:51:52,380
I'd say nature speaking,

836
00:51:52,470 --> 00:51:57,390
I might say nature screaming and I'd like
to put those outside every place where

837
00:51:57,391 --> 00:51:59,850
there's like this quote
unquote natural disaster,

838
00:51:59,851 --> 00:52:04,110
which is usually a human disaster that
was exacerbated by just not listening to

839
00:52:04,111 --> 00:52:08,400
nature. Um, that's what I do. And
I'd always influenced by like,

840
00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:09,840
you drive across this country,

841
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:14,130
you see these signs for like
religious purposes, right?

842
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:19,070
Like so, so, and so daddy will do
this to you or not do this to you,

843
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:21,050
only you believe. And I was taught, well,

844
00:52:21,051 --> 00:52:25,280
why don't we put that same kind of effort
into putting billboards up that says

845
00:52:25,281 --> 00:52:27,350
nature screaming or nature speaking,

846
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:29,570
when are we going to listen
to something like that?

847
00:52:29,870 --> 00:52:31,760
So that's probably what I done it.

848
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:36,570
I really want to, and this isn't
just a professional courtesy,

849
00:52:36,571 --> 00:52:41,340
so we can talk about the work
you're doing. Conservation and uh,

850
00:52:41,341 --> 00:52:41,590
the,

851
00:52:41,590 --> 00:52:46,590
the state of progressive
destruction of our

852
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:53,260
natural habitats and surroundings
causes me a lot of anxiety. Uh,

853
00:52:53,261 --> 00:52:57,460
personally. Uh, in part because
I feel like for instance,

854
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:02,480
if a study comes out on metabolism
and there are a bunch of conflicting

855
00:53:03,011 --> 00:53:07,840
headlines and things are
poorly interpreted by certain
media, I can parse it.

856
00:53:07,870 --> 00:53:10,090
I can go to pub med,
I can figure out what's what.

857
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:15,190
But in the world of a conservation
are trying to do the right thing,

858
00:53:16,030 --> 00:53:20,290
I sometimes feel lost in the sense that
I attempt to do the right thing when I

859
00:53:20,291 --> 00:53:22,600
perceived to be the right thing.
And then I find out, oh shit,

860
00:53:22,601 --> 00:53:26,760
that type of wild caught fish or farmed
is exactly the opposite of what I should

861
00:53:26,761 --> 00:53:27,660
be doing or whatever it might be.

862
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:28,950
B a

863
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:29,973
what are,

864
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:34,640
you're gonna have a lot of people
listening to this, people in this room,

865
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:36,890
then people on the podcast.
What are some of,

866
00:53:36,891 --> 00:53:41,891
if people want to think more precisely
about this and feel like they can take

867
00:53:44,571 --> 00:53:45,830
proactive steps,

868
00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:51,410
what are some of the most common
misconceptions about conservation?

869
00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:54,840
Or what's a smart way to just approach it?
Thinking about it?

870
00:53:56,910 --> 00:53:57,211
Right.

871
00:53:57,211 --> 00:54:02,211
So the first thing I would say is don't
let perfection and trying to find the

872
00:54:03,661 --> 00:54:06,540
silver bullet keep you out of the game.

873
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:10,460
So we were both recently, um, at a,

874
00:54:10,461 --> 00:54:13,740
at summit in Los Angeles and you know,

875
00:54:13,741 --> 00:54:18,741
I heard people talk about philanthropy
and giving and wanting to find like the

876
00:54:19,561 --> 00:54:21,600
most perfect way to get,

877
00:54:22,350 --> 00:54:25,380
and I was sorta struck by how many
people were around me all nodding.

878
00:54:25,381 --> 00:54:29,550
And I used to think to myself
like really like, yeah, okay,

879
00:54:29,551 --> 00:54:33,000
I want to make sure my dollar
goes the furthest as well.

880
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:36,360
There's so many other things in life,
which we waste all the time.

881
00:54:36,361 --> 00:54:41,340
And why this one? We want
perfection. So you know,

882
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:43,080
when you, when I, when
someone says to me like,

883
00:54:43,081 --> 00:54:47,900
tell me the one thing I can do to change
the planet. Like, guess what, there isn't,

884
00:54:48,470 --> 00:54:51,780
there's lots of things and it's messy.
You're not always going to get a right.

885
00:54:51,781 --> 00:54:55,890
And is it better to drink out of ceramic
cup that you have to wash in hot water

886
00:54:55,891 --> 00:54:58,140
or uh, you know, a Styrofoam Cup.

887
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:00,660
Those are important questions
for you to think about,

888
00:55:00,661 --> 00:55:05,640
but ultimately they shouldn't stop
you from, from getting engaged.

889
00:55:06,110 --> 00:55:08,520
So the truth of the matter is very,
very,

890
00:55:08,550 --> 00:55:13,550
very few people are actually engaged in
like trying to care about the fate of

891
00:55:13,981 --> 00:55:18,470
our planet, fate of where we
live and our kids lives. Um,

892
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:22,050
and I just want to get more people in it.
And I think if more in it,

893
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:25,560
then absolutely we'll come
up with more honed solutions.

894
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:30,240
But it shouldn't stop you from getting
in it. So that's like my first thing.

895
00:55:30,241 --> 00:55:33,870
I would say if you want to make
some small changes in your life,

896
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:38,730
like what you eat and how you cook,
it makes a huge difference.

897
00:55:38,730 --> 00:55:42,750
Like it's probably the one thing that
you could do to being thoughtful,

898
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:45,570
like whether it's farm
caught or wa that's it.

899
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:50,600
Useful question to think about and try
to get least the best pathway there.

900
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:52,050
And I can answer that for you.

901
00:55:52,110 --> 00:55:55,290
Like you like seafood watch and
the Monterey Bay aquarium puts out,

902
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:59,190
gives you a reasonable pathway,
but how you cook and how you waste food,

903
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:04,110
like wasting food is a big, big deal.
Like your energy output on those,

904
00:56:04,111 --> 00:56:07,890
it's like completely outweighs what car
you drive or anything like that. Right?

905
00:56:07,950 --> 00:56:11,130
So that's just something
simple you can do, you know,

906
00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:15,150
get engaged in the political
system. I think it really
does matter. I, I, you know,

907
00:56:15,990 --> 00:56:17,640
I mean it really does matter,
right?

908
00:56:17,641 --> 00:56:21,930
So there was this kind of crazy
decision very recently on,

909
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:24,240
on wanting to at this moment in time,

910
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:27,010
but all of these crises
are going on the planet on,

911
00:56:27,170 --> 00:56:32,170
on overturning the ban on
importing elephant heads from,

912
00:56:33,070 --> 00:56:38,070
from trophy hunting from Zimbabwe and
Zambia like that actually somehow became a

913
00:56:41,591 --> 00:56:46,400
priority for the administration. Like all
of a sudden like we're gonna like, oh,

914
00:56:46,410 --> 00:56:50,650
turn the bands so that any hunter who
goes to Zimbabwe or Zambian shoots an

915
00:56:50,651 --> 00:56:54,130
elephant and bring the ivory and
they had into the country. Like,

916
00:56:54,190 --> 00:56:56,560
why is that all of a
sudden the thing to do?

917
00:56:57,070 --> 00:57:02,070
And people really got upset about it
and believe it or not kind of did change

918
00:57:02,350 --> 00:57:06,820
something. At least for now, there's
been a reversal of that decision.

919
00:57:06,821 --> 00:57:10,900
So the administration has decided to like,
wait on that for a while.

920
00:57:10,990 --> 00:57:12,610
So make your voices heard.

921
00:57:12,611 --> 00:57:15,430
It's important that you make your
voices heard and don't sit this out.

922
00:57:16,150 --> 00:57:20,110
Are there any other resources that
you would suggest people look to?

923
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:22,030
Like Seafood Watch or

924
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:23,113
uh,

925
00:57:23,870 --> 00:57:28,870
any other websites where people could
find simple things they might not think of

926
00:57:28,941 --> 00:57:29,870
like this lower shipping,

927
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:31,293
uh,

928
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,590
to make an impact.
I mean,

929
00:57:34,591 --> 00:57:38,640
if just assuming these people are busy
professionals with high demands on their

930
00:57:38,641 --> 00:57:39,474
time,

931
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,810
would you suggest they look okay?

932
00:57:42,811 --> 00:57:46,470
So now and without being
totally self serving.

933
00:57:46,471 --> 00:57:49,670
So I will say my own organization,

934
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:52,410
conservation.org decent website.

935
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:56,040
You'll find lots of ways in which you
can be engaged. The Nature Conservancy,

936
00:57:56,041 --> 00:57:58,470
nature.org decent website,

937
00:57:58,650 --> 00:58:01,560
lots of ways you can get engaged
in environmental defense fund.

938
00:58:02,070 --> 00:58:06,160
They do a lot of great work, particularly
in the United States around climate. Um,

939
00:58:06,330 --> 00:58:10,710
world resource institute gives you the
macro picture. They've great graphics,

940
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:14,020
great infographics, gives you
sort of the macro picture. Um,

941
00:58:14,130 --> 00:58:19,130
I did a series recently on vox vox with
the University of California called

942
00:58:19,681 --> 00:58:20,580
climate labs,

943
00:58:20,790 --> 00:58:25,650
which are just these eight minute
very short digestible little videos on

944
00:58:25,770 --> 00:58:29,250
something like food waste,
slightly irreverent,

945
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:31,290
slightly counter intuitive,

946
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:36,320
simple ways in which you can either get
engaged or make the change in your life.

947
00:58:36,390 --> 00:58:37,230
You can have an impact.

948
00:58:37,590 --> 00:58:40,870
And so we took a bunch of
different topics like shipping and,

949
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:44,250
and did the short videos on,
it's called climate labs on box.

950
00:58:44,370 --> 00:58:46,290
So those are sort of things
that come quickly to mind.

951
00:58:46,410 --> 00:58:49,260
But here's the most important thing.
Seriously, I really mean this.

952
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:54,360
We really are on a race to save the
planet. I really, really believe this.

953
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:56,070
W you know,
here's the thing,

954
00:58:56,190 --> 00:58:59,340
we're the only generation who
actually has some foresight.

955
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:02,040
I think that this and the
entire history of humanity,

956
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:06,750
we had to like rely on like crystal balls
and like, you know, like, I don't know,

957
00:59:06,751 --> 00:59:10,050
like a burning Bush,
right?

958
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:11,760
Sitting where we are,

959
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:17,240
give us a glimpse to give us a
glimpse of where we're heading.

960
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:24,800
And now we actually some big with the
first generation in human history to see

961
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:27,380
the INTAPP Emmett John Glenn,
before he passed away,

962
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:30,680
amazing guy makes America just
American to go round planet.

963
00:59:30,681 --> 00:59:33,410
See the whole thing I asked him,
he said he had blew me away.

964
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:36,200
I never thought we could see
the whole planet all at once.

965
00:59:36,410 --> 00:59:41,210
Like if you were standing on a flat earth,
if you're standing on, on uh, on the,

966
00:59:41,211 --> 00:59:44,600
on the seashore, you see about seven
miles after that, the horizon dips away.

967
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:46,430
And as long as humans have been around,

968
00:59:46,431 --> 00:59:49,160
we've been climbing taller
and taller mountains, towers,

969
00:59:49,190 --> 00:59:53,150
trees to be able to see what's over
the horizon, what are we looking for?

970
00:59:53,290 --> 00:59:56,270
We're thinking about Elian that's over
the horizon and my buyers are looking for

971
00:59:56,271 --> 01:00:00,830
opportunity now in our generation we
can see the whole thing and only that we

972
01:00:00,831 --> 01:00:02,540
also mostly all connected.

973
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:07,130
There is no reason for us not
to act right now and believe me,

974
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:10,700
that window is small
and if we don't do it,

975
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:14,420
I swear future generation will
look back and said, what a waste.

976
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:18,290
You had that opportunity when the
opportunity costs was actually relatively

977
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:22,670
cheap. The price of conservation
will never get cheaper in the future.

978
01:00:23,330 --> 01:00:26,960
It's as cheap as it's going to get now,
only get more expensive.

979
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:32,200
So not acting now is crazy and that's
what people who've done the giving pledge,

980
01:00:32,271 --> 01:00:33,890
like Cakes d case and others.

981
01:00:33,891 --> 01:00:37,670
I so applaud that because they're not
just saying we're going to lead this.

982
01:00:37,671 --> 01:00:38,331
We would,
you know,

983
01:00:38,331 --> 01:00:41,270
leave this for future generations to deal
with this and we're going to deal with

984
01:00:41,271 --> 01:00:45,530
it now because right now it's probably
the cheapest to be able to deal with it.

985
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:53,160
[inaudible]

986
01:00:55,540 --> 01:00:59,200
so I'll ask just a few more questions
and then we'll do some audience and then

987
01:00:59,201 --> 01:01:01,480
we'll head off to Tequila
shots or whatever comes next.

988
01:01:02,710 --> 01:01:07,710
But I really want to ask you what you
found helpful for training humans to think

989
01:01:12,911 --> 01:01:13,810
more long term.

990
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:18,460
Because it strikes me that if you look
at history and you don't have to go very

991
01:01:18,461 --> 01:01:21,520
far back, but you certainly
could, that we've a mall,

992
01:01:21,550 --> 01:01:26,530
we've evolved for millions of years
effectively to survive until puberty have

993
01:01:26,531 --> 01:01:30,470
sacks and procreate. Yeah.
That's basically, yeah.

994
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:33,070
I mean that's Darwinism at work and

995
01:01:35,690 --> 01:01:38,690
people will act in their,

996
01:01:38,810 --> 01:01:40,730
in intensely,

997
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:42,113
uh,

998
01:01:45,010 --> 01:01:49,510
I mean, worst of interests, long
term for short term gain. Yeah.

999
01:01:50,470 --> 01:01:55,380
How do you train people to think more, uh,

1000
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:56,430
in long,

1001
01:01:56,430 --> 01:02:01,430
longer term time horizons and in ways
that are more communal and not individual?

1002
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:05,550
It's, it seems like a very tough task,
but a very, very, very important one.

1003
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:07,410
What does it,
what are some of the,

1004
01:02:08,010 --> 01:02:08,330
okay,

1005
01:02:08,330 --> 01:02:12,050
most effective learnings or
lessons that you've had with that?

1006
01:02:12,450 --> 01:02:16,560
I, I'm, I don't know. That's
the truth of the answer.

1007
01:02:16,890 --> 01:02:21,180
I don't know how to fundamentally
evolutionary biology.

1008
01:02:21,770 --> 01:02:25,680
It is so hardwired into us,
the people who do and do it rationally.

1009
01:02:25,681 --> 01:02:29,490
So you'd like look at like, you know what
Charlie Munger says, right? It says, look,

1010
01:02:29,491 --> 01:02:32,220
we basically, our investment
technology technique, you know,

1011
01:02:32,310 --> 01:02:36,150
that he and buffered use is just don't
do anything stupid over the long run.

1012
01:02:37,050 --> 01:02:39,840
Pretty much that that's, he
basically says that, right? It's,

1013
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:43,310
it's surprisingly simple,
but incredibly hard to follow,

1014
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:45,210
incredibly hard to follow.

1015
01:02:45,390 --> 01:02:49,370
And the people who do it tend to be
sort of investors and others who, who,

1016
01:02:49,430 --> 01:02:52,080
who sort of faithfully follow a system.

1017
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:57,030
But even they get spooked as we, as
we've seen many, many times over. Right?

1018
01:02:57,210 --> 01:03:00,510
So it's very difficult to beat it.
So I'm not trying to do that.

1019
01:03:00,511 --> 01:03:04,680
I'm just trying to figure out how I
can make you changing your life for the

1020
01:03:04,681 --> 01:03:08,430
betterment of the planet in your
own enlightened self interest.

1021
01:03:09,030 --> 01:03:12,480
And the better I can do that and tell
you that it's actually gonna make your

1022
01:03:12,481 --> 01:03:16,410
life better now. Now, now, now,
not even your kids, but your life,

1023
01:03:16,770 --> 01:03:19,350
the better chance I have
of promoting change.

1024
01:03:19,650 --> 01:03:24,480
The interesting thing is it doesn't have
to be rational because we do so many

1025
01:03:24,481 --> 01:03:29,481
things that are completely irrational
and so it doesn't have to be rational.

1026
01:03:29,970 --> 01:03:30,480
It,

1027
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:35,040
it can be very emotional and it has
to be about your own enlightened self

1028
01:03:35,041 --> 01:03:36,870
interest.
It can't be about the future.

1029
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:43,590
So I think at some point we'll have to
do around too. But look, that's just my,

1030
01:03:43,650 --> 01:03:48,650
like I'm stuck and any help you
have and want to throw it my way.

1031
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:50,910
Wowway we'll,
we'll take it,

1032
01:03:50,970 --> 01:03:55,530
but I'm actually stuck because I know
much better communicator than I am and far

1033
01:03:55,531 --> 01:03:59,970
smarter people than I am in my field was,
we're basically stuck as well.

1034
01:04:00,630 --> 01:04:02,170
Well too.
To that point with them.

1035
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:07,171
I know my next question is going to
be what ask would you have of people

1036
01:04:08,461 --> 01:04:10,830
listening,
is there anything that you're looking for,

1037
01:04:10,890 --> 01:04:15,890
any particular type of help or just next
steps that people you would like to see

1038
01:04:16,021 --> 01:04:19,110
people take? Because you have to
have a lot of people listening,

1039
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:22,500
people in all different walks of life,
different sectors,

1040
01:04:22,590 --> 01:04:27,090
every possible place imaginable. What
would you like them to do or consider?

1041
01:04:28,110 --> 01:04:29,300
So,
um,

1042
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:32,910
the most important thing you could do
for me or for us or for this cause is to

1043
01:04:32,911 --> 01:04:33,744
be a messenger.

1044
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:38,640
It really is quite simply that because
the people who are more likely to listen

1045
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:40,140
or people like yourself,

1046
01:04:40,141 --> 01:04:44,610
the more likely it is that message
coming from you than if it came from me.

1047
01:04:45,330 --> 01:04:46,980
And that's really like,

1048
01:04:46,981 --> 01:04:51,120
so I strongly believe like I
strongly believe in that, right?

1049
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:54,000
It's the messenger matters as much as
the master and you can reach audiences

1050
01:04:54,001 --> 01:04:55,140
that I could never reach.

1051
01:04:55,440 --> 01:05:00,270
So being that messenger to carry
that message into your community,

1052
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:04,920
into your church or synagogue,
your place of worship, your school,

1053
01:05:04,950 --> 01:05:07,440
your community,
your family is far,

1054
01:05:07,441 --> 01:05:12,441
far more useful than me trying to just
get my voice to be bigger and bigger and

1055
01:05:12,961 --> 01:05:16,620
bigger. Thank you. Uh,

1056
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:18,550
and where can people say

1057
01:05:18,610 --> 01:05:22,870
hello to you on social or learn
more about what you're up to?

1058
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:26,880
Is Twitter the best place? I'm sorry.
Is Twitter the best place for him?

1059
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:28,820
Twitter is a good place.
Um,

1060
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:32,820
Facebook is also really good because
it allows a longer conversation to just

1061
01:05:32,830 --> 01:05:35,050
sort of occur. So you know, I'm,

1062
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:39,760
I can easily be found as m Sanjayan and
some on Facebook and that's a good place

1063
01:05:39,761 --> 01:05:44,530
to also engage in trade is fine too.
Then conservation.org yeah,

1064
01:05:44,531 --> 01:05:46,300
and conservation.org. So I, you know,

1065
01:05:46,301 --> 01:05:51,100
I think our website and our social media
platform is a great place to engage.

1066
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:53,860
Perfect.
So we'll take me for a DC audience,

1067
01:05:53,861 --> 01:05:55,540
but I think also for our global audience.

1068
01:05:56,450 --> 01:05:57,080
Okay.

1069
01:05:57,080 --> 01:06:00,710
So this is, this is, I think a good
place to grab. Just a few questions,

1070
01:06:00,740 --> 01:06:04,640
then we can,
we can close up and have some,

1071
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:08,240
have some Tequila. Give George Clooney
a few hundred million more dollars.

1072
01:06:09,030 --> 01:06:10,810
February as a customer.
You go story. What us.

1073
01:06:10,910 --> 01:06:12,500
All right. By the way, while
he's thinking about that, I,

1074
01:06:12,530 --> 01:06:15,780
one of the book I want to mention to
you guys, especially for this town,

1075
01:06:16,110 --> 01:06:19,980
is a book called down destiny of
the republic by Candace Maillard.

1076
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:21,600
It's a fantastic book.

1077
01:06:21,601 --> 01:06:26,010
She's a great author and she talks about
President Garfield and being shot and

1078
01:06:26,011 --> 01:06:30,990
how his life could have been saved if
they'd only listened to the surgeon who

1079
01:06:30,991 --> 01:06:31,830
gave them the advice.

1080
01:06:31,831 --> 01:06:35,310
But he was sort of ignored because it
was this black surgeon in the union army.

1081
01:06:35,311 --> 01:06:36,660
And instead they took another route.

1082
01:06:36,661 --> 01:06:41,661
And it's just been a fascinating story
about race and technology at the cusp of,

1083
01:06:42,181 --> 01:06:44,370
of a really important
moment in our nation.

1084
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:47,310
But a president that very few
people had heard about, but who,

1085
01:06:47,340 --> 01:06:50,970
if he had survived with completely
changed the course of our country,

1086
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:52,193
probably for the better.

1087
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:58,400
So this,
this is a question from bill long island.

1088
01:06:59,510 --> 01:07:01,670
Uh, it's addressed to me,
but I'm going to ask you,

1089
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:05,460
since I've talked at nauseum
about my mornings, uh,

1090
01:07:05,510 --> 01:07:08,030
what does the first 60 to 90
seconds of your day look like?

1091
01:07:08,031 --> 01:07:10,600
I'm going to modify this, uh,
but, but he's asking what,

1092
01:07:10,601 --> 01:07:12,740
what to do to jump start
the first waking moments.

1093
01:07:12,741 --> 01:07:17,741
Do you have any morning rituals or
routines that are consistent for you?

1094
01:07:19,270 --> 01:07:19,860
Okay.

1095
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:23,690
Uh, anything that you do in
the first coffee? Yeah. Uh,

1096
01:07:23,870 --> 01:07:25,500
to jumpstart my day?
Yeah.

1097
01:07:25,510 --> 01:07:29,450
Or just anything that you do as part of
your routine in the mornings. Yeah. So,

1098
01:07:29,451 --> 01:07:29,721
you know,

1099
01:07:29,721 --> 01:07:33,440
I often put like the toughest things I
need to deal with and the most creative

1100
01:07:33,441 --> 01:07:36,740
things early in the morning.
It's just as simple as that. Um,

1101
01:07:36,830 --> 01:07:39,780
I tend not to,
um,

1102
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:44,630
I tend not to check my email
until I'm actually starting work.

1103
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:48,620
That's just something I, my, my work
email on until I'm actually starting.

1104
01:07:48,621 --> 01:07:53,610
What is it just really quiet as the mine
and what, so what happens with email is,

1105
01:07:53,660 --> 01:07:56,420
especially for my company because
it's a global organization,

1106
01:07:56,421 --> 01:08:00,740
so I get emails in the middle of the night
and so they pile up and see if I find

1107
01:08:00,741 --> 01:08:04,010
out that if I,
if I open my day by checking email,

1108
01:08:04,340 --> 01:08:08,930
I get diverted into all these other small
things that I am very bad at saying no

1109
01:08:08,931 --> 01:08:12,500
to. So I kind of ruined the
rest of that day and raw the,

1110
01:08:12,501 --> 01:08:17,501
I sort of want to set my agenda then
look at it and deal with the ones I can

1111
01:08:17,631 --> 01:08:19,220
deal with and ignore the others.

1112
01:08:22,210 --> 01:08:26,430
This is a question from, it's either
Eric or Erin, I'm not quite sure. Uh,

1113
01:08:27,070 --> 01:08:30,250
who's your most recent mentor and
what has that person taught you?

1114
01:08:30,330 --> 01:08:33,100
And I mean we could make that if
you have an answer for that. Great.

1115
01:08:33,130 --> 01:08:34,210
Otherwise we could,

1116
01:08:34,211 --> 01:08:39,211
we could modify it to just be what is
a recent lesson that you've learned or

1117
01:08:41,051 --> 01:08:41,884
insight.

1118
01:08:41,910 --> 01:08:42,440
So you know,

1119
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:46,310
that's a good one because it kind of
Hawk Hawk of the back to you know, tribe,

1120
01:08:46,311 --> 01:08:49,190
tribal mentor. So one of the things
that I did that I found very,

1121
01:08:49,191 --> 01:08:53,480
very useful in my life and I think for
many of you you could apply to is that

1122
01:08:53,510 --> 01:08:56,180
some years ago I created a personal board,

1123
01:08:56,780 --> 01:09:01,010
so a group of individuals who would
personally spend a little bit of time

1124
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:04,040
investing in me and my success,

1125
01:09:04,430 --> 01:09:08,060
and I didn't do this because it's some
grandiose notion of why was it struck me

1126
01:09:08,061 --> 01:09:11,120
that whenever you wanted like letters
of reference, when you go for a job,

1127
01:09:11,270 --> 01:09:14,660
you're always didn't have to like sort
of scramble around and try to catch up to

1128
01:09:14,661 --> 01:09:18,170
people who you haven't spoken to for a
long time and hope they'll give you this

1129
01:09:18,171 --> 01:09:21,710
letter and they really don't know you
by that point in life is sort of gone by

1130
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:22,271
and they'll,
well,

1131
01:09:22,271 --> 01:09:26,930
what happens if I had a group of say
five individuals that I would pick and I

1132
01:09:26,931 --> 01:09:29,690
would make a promise that I've never
solicited them for money, which I've,

1133
01:09:30,140 --> 01:09:34,520
I've kept up in, there's some now do
give to Cei, but that's not the purpose.

1134
01:09:34,580 --> 01:09:36,800
They don't belong to my organization.

1135
01:09:36,801 --> 01:09:41,270
They're not my board for my organization.
There my personal board,

1136
01:09:41,660 --> 01:09:45,380
um, and the great people and I
would just say to them, listen,

1137
01:09:45,381 --> 01:09:48,440
can you do this for me? I'll meet with
you two, maybe three times a week.

1138
01:09:48,441 --> 01:09:51,170
We'll have coffee or lunch
two, three times a week, sorry,

1139
01:09:51,171 --> 01:09:54,770
two or three times a year.
Okay, I got it. I was like, man,

1140
01:09:54,771 --> 01:09:59,030
this is a really generous for us.
Sorry. Um, and we'll, you know,

1141
01:09:59,031 --> 01:10:00,960
we'll just have a little conversation and,

1142
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:05,180
and a catch up and I can just
occasionally ping you for guidance.

1143
01:10:05,450 --> 01:10:10,250
That has been incredibly, incredibly
useful. I picked some great people.

1144
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:14,060
Um, you might know some of them,
but it's been very, very helpful.

1145
01:10:14,250 --> 01:10:17,220
Okay. So I want to, I want to dig into
this because this is really interesting.

1146
01:10:17,221 --> 01:10:21,330
So your personal board, by
the way, they all said yes.

1147
01:10:21,810 --> 01:10:26,120
One person tell me down. Well, yeah,
how can we not get into this? Uh,

1148
01:10:26,340 --> 01:10:28,550
now I want to mention just as a side note,

1149
01:10:28,551 --> 01:10:29,880
because people might find this helpful.

1150
01:10:29,881 --> 01:10:34,290
Something that I've found very
helpful from Chris Fussell who,

1151
01:10:34,570 --> 01:10:35,403
uh,

1152
01:10:35,670 --> 01:10:40,670
coauthored a team of teams with
Stan Mcchrystal and he was,

1153
01:10:41,340 --> 01:10:45,880
uh, stands aide to camp for quite
a long time and Jay sock, uh,

1154
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:49,740
and advice that he was
given was at all times.

1155
01:10:49,741 --> 01:10:54,120
You want to surround yourself
with at least three people,

1156
01:10:54,450 --> 01:10:58,860
someone who is doing an excellent
job of what you hope to be doing,

1157
01:10:58,890 --> 01:10:59,880
say a few years from now,

1158
01:11:00,270 --> 01:11:03,870
someone who is doing a better job than
you are in some capacity at what you're

1159
01:11:03,871 --> 01:11:08,160
doing now. And then somebody who
is doing something you used to do,

1160
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:09,870
but it's doing it much
better than you did.

1161
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:14,250
And that was how he ended up
seeking people to surround himself

1162
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:18,480
with. How did you choose
since they all said yes,

1163
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:21,120
I guess you reached out to
five or six people, right?

1164
01:11:21,130 --> 01:11:24,270
Or how did you choose those people?
What were the criteria?

1165
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:29,430
You know, I look, I wanted
people I, I respected.

1166
01:11:29,550 --> 01:11:31,020
So that was sort of important to me.

1167
01:11:31,021 --> 01:11:34,230
They had to be people I
really sort of respected.

1168
01:11:34,260 --> 01:11:38,520
I wanted people who were not in my field
because I had plenty of colleagues in

1169
01:11:38,521 --> 01:11:42,330
my field. Um, I wanted people, so
it was, I'll just give you some,

1170
01:11:42,390 --> 01:11:45,030
I'll give you some names.
I don't think it matters that much.

1171
01:11:45,031 --> 01:11:49,590
So Tom Tierney Bridgespan, he's also the
chairman of the Nature Conservancy now.

1172
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:54,150
Really Smart Guy. You know, he kind of
gets how businesses should organize.

1173
01:11:54,450 --> 01:11:55,890
He sort of just this,

1174
01:11:55,980 --> 01:12:00,980
he coached me on how to get the CEO job
for conservation international and the

1175
01:12:01,891 --> 01:12:05,730
tips he gave me what incredibly valuable,
like incredible.

1176
01:12:05,850 --> 01:12:08,970
I'd never realized that you could
actually coat your way into a job.

1177
01:12:09,030 --> 01:12:12,090
And that guy really helped me do
that. So that was one. Paula Kerger,

1178
01:12:12,091 --> 01:12:16,860
she's the see the president
of PBS mazing woman.

1179
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:19,310
Very unusual.
She was a development staff.

1180
01:12:19,350 --> 01:12:23,100
She asked people for money and then
rose up the ranks and ended up running.

1181
01:12:23,310 --> 01:12:26,370
PBS should also is across
the road from my office.

1182
01:12:26,371 --> 01:12:30,840
So it's kind of easy to sometimes see
her really smart, very thoughtful,

1183
01:12:30,841 --> 01:12:34,020
wonderful kind,
generous person gaining set.

1184
01:12:34,021 --> 01:12:37,800
Neimann crosspoint venture partners. It's
one as companies also race car driver,

1185
01:12:38,010 --> 01:12:40,050
that guy interview CEO's for lending.

1186
01:12:40,051 --> 01:12:44,250
So his whole job is about interviewing
CEO's and deciding which ones he wants to

1187
01:12:44,251 --> 01:12:46,620
bet on. As a, as a venture capital guy,

1188
01:12:47,190 --> 01:12:51,930
really useful for me as I'm thinking
about what qualities and attributes I want

1189
01:12:51,931 --> 01:12:53,700
to strengthen, you know, as a CEO.

1190
01:12:53,820 --> 01:12:58,380
So I sort of looked at it that way as
I created this group of folks who could

1191
01:12:58,650 --> 01:12:59,820
sort of help and guide.

1192
01:13:00,330 --> 01:13:04,260
Were they people that you'd had
contact with before or yeah, no, no.

1193
01:13:04,261 --> 01:13:07,530
They were all people who had somehow
been in my orbit. And then I thought,

1194
01:13:07,531 --> 01:13:11,970
well let's just try and make this formal
in some way and let's just see if they

1195
01:13:11,980 --> 01:13:16,560
would agree to do this. And they all said,
yeah, and one or two of those. But yes,

1196
01:13:16,650 --> 01:13:21,160
so long as you do that to me in return,
which was a very nice flattering thing. I,

1197
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:24,770
I'm sure it doesn't work that way,
but that's been very useful. And,

1198
01:13:24,820 --> 01:13:29,220
and believe me, I did end up using
that board when I went through my seat,

1199
01:13:29,221 --> 01:13:32,190
the CEO search.
So it was 150 days ago,

1200
01:13:32,250 --> 01:13:36,460
our founder who had been
running contribution to
Nashville for 30 years step

1201
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:38,580
down and you know,

1202
01:13:38,670 --> 01:13:43,670
and I became the CEO and last year the
board went through a very challenging

1203
01:13:43,861 --> 01:13:48,600
process of trying to decide who the next
CEO and what the next leadership team

1204
01:13:48,601 --> 01:13:49,434
would look like.

1205
01:13:49,530 --> 01:13:53,700
And it's a very scary moment for an
organization because all the half of the

1206
01:13:53,701 --> 01:13:58,290
CEOs who come in after found a fail.
And actually if you want to get the job,

1207
01:13:58,291 --> 01:14:00,990
you want to be the one in waiting.
Like seriously.

1208
01:14:00,991 --> 01:14:03,410
Like that's what typically happens.
New CEO comes in,

1209
01:14:03,450 --> 01:14:07,620
they fail and either the old CEO comes
back or the person in waiting kind of

1210
01:14:07,621 --> 01:14:08,970
gets the role and then runs it.

1211
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:12,550
So it's fraught with challenges
and dangers all over the place.

1212
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:14,470
And I really didn't think I would get it.

1213
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:16,240
I thought there was a
chance I would get it,

1214
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:19,660
but I was really worried
about it for lots of reasons,

1215
01:14:20,380 --> 01:14:24,010
including my color to be
absolutely honest. Um, and this,

1216
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:29,170
these groups of this mentoring group,
honest to God, coached me, them.

1217
01:14:29,171 --> 01:14:32,200
And a couple of other people really
helped coach me through this.

1218
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:35,260
Can you share any of the advice?
Yeah, one of the good simple one.

1219
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:39,370
So this is such an amazing thing and
I've applied for other jobs before,

1220
01:14:39,371 --> 01:14:44,371
like kind of like the CEO or top level
person job and not got that three times

1221
01:14:45,071 --> 01:14:47,500
in the past. I've been rejected
for that. Get very close.

1222
01:14:47,501 --> 01:14:50,440
And then somehow either they talked
me out of it, I get rejected,

1223
01:14:51,190 --> 01:14:54,130
here's what I was doing. So they
would ask me. So do you like,

1224
01:14:54,370 --> 01:14:57,250
tell me about the social, why
do you want the job? Well look,

1225
01:14:57,310 --> 01:15:00,280
I've got a good career. I don't
really need this. But you know,

1226
01:15:00,281 --> 01:15:01,850
if it was the right thing,
you know,

1227
01:15:01,851 --> 01:15:06,010
you kind of had this like kind of a
long meandering story about saying,

1228
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:10,600
you know, I'm not totally vested.
Like yeah, I could do this,

1229
01:15:10,601 --> 01:15:11,710
but I could do a lot of other things.

1230
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:13,930
And I actually feel that
way in a lot of ways. Right?

1231
01:15:13,931 --> 01:15:17,620
So in a lot of ways I think I'm
definitely, I didn't start my life again.

1232
01:15:17,650 --> 01:15:19,480
I want to be the CEO of
Conservation International.

1233
01:15:19,570 --> 01:15:23,470
There was never a dream is never a goal,
never got the goal was much.

1234
01:15:23,530 --> 01:15:26,680
It goes to have impact and
really care how I had impact,

1235
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:30,640
but with these guys said to me was like,
one guy actually said this to him.

1236
01:15:30,641 --> 01:15:34,120
He said, that is not the right
answer. I want you to repeat after me.

1237
01:15:34,630 --> 01:15:38,620
Say I will walk through a
wall to get this job. He said,

1238
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:42,340
I'll say it like my radio set
side. I walked through. It says,

1239
01:15:42,341 --> 01:15:43,750
now when you go into an interview,

1240
01:15:43,751 --> 01:15:46,510
they're going to ask you this question
and I want you to repeat this.

1241
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:50,200
I will walk through. He did. First
question, why do you want this job?

1242
01:15:50,201 --> 01:15:54,310
Tell us what prepared you for this job.
I said, let me make one thing clear.

1243
01:15:54,340 --> 01:15:56,390
I will walk through a wall together

1244
01:15:58,250 --> 01:16:02,940
and they all went great
because guess what? Most times
when you're hiring people,

1245
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,050
and I do this all the time,

1246
01:16:04,051 --> 01:16:08,160
I hire people all the time
and I'm so amazed that I
didn't listen to my own rule.

1247
01:16:08,310 --> 01:16:12,870
You want someone who gives
you the confidence that
they will solve the problems

1248
01:16:12,871 --> 01:16:15,570
that you don't want to deal with.
You want someone who's coming in and say,

1249
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:18,840
you know what? I got this. You don't
want someone to come in and say,

1250
01:16:19,020 --> 01:16:23,610
I don't know if I really wanted to
convince me it start negotiating day one.

1251
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:27,300
Don't want to do that. It's
a very, very simple rule.

1252
01:16:27,390 --> 01:16:31,350
So whatever job you go for,
start by saying, let me be clear.

1253
01:16:31,470 --> 01:16:35,940
I really want the swack job.
I will walk through a wall to get the job.

1254
01:16:36,510 --> 01:16:39,510
Now let me tell you what makes me
so great for this and slay it out.

1255
01:16:39,690 --> 01:16:43,410
You can negotiate later.
Really some point

1256
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:49,920
when you sent the emails out to recruit
this x men team of mentors to formal

1257
01:16:50,561 --> 01:16:54,910
structure. Well, a couple of questions
and this won't go on and on for hours.

1258
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:58,700
Don't worry guys, even though it could
and it might later with Tequila. Uh,

1259
01:16:59,010 --> 01:17:01,960
I don't know why I keep
thinking of Tequila. We could
psychoanalyze that later.

1260
01:17:02,340 --> 01:17:06,910
Uh, do you interact with these
mentors as a group or is it all

1261
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:08,250
one, two, one, one on one?

1262
01:17:08,251 --> 01:17:11,060
All that they know about on one because
getting them together as a group would

1263
01:17:11,061 --> 01:17:15,620
be too impossible. Yeah. Do
you block out say a week?

1264
01:17:15,621 --> 01:17:19,840
Every quarter just to schedule them
in in batches? Yeah, and I did not.

1265
01:17:20,270 --> 01:17:23,290
I schedule it around travel
that I have unnecessary.

1266
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:28,300
So I do this as much as I can in person
unless I have a crisis or an emergency

1267
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:31,780
and just need to get on the phone and
then they're always willing. Like I,

1268
01:17:31,781 --> 01:17:34,070
I literally,
today I had a little 90 crazy,

1269
01:17:34,250 --> 01:17:38,240
I literally had a CEO of a company,
I didn't want to name it,

1270
01:17:38,370 --> 01:17:43,370
but normally nor was enormous company he
would turn to my call today is so slow.

1271
01:17:45,391 --> 01:17:47,840
It's like, I'm so sorry it took me so
long to get back to you. And I'm like,

1272
01:17:47,841 --> 01:17:50,060
are you kidding me? And
he's like, they, you know,

1273
01:17:50,061 --> 01:17:54,850
once you get that relationship with
that few individuals, it, it does work.

1274
01:17:54,950 --> 01:17:57,950
It can really work very well.
Did you make, did you say, Hey,

1275
01:17:57,951 --> 01:18:00,720
let's grab coffee and then make the
pitch in person or did you lay it out in

1276
01:18:00,730 --> 01:18:04,460
email made it either? No, I did.
I don't think I did by email.

1277
01:18:04,610 --> 01:18:08,720
I think I did all by phone or when I
met them in person after back the first

1278
01:18:08,721 --> 01:18:11,750
coffee. So the people I knew, well
I did by phone and the Pea by,

1279
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:14,690
I'll tell you one thing though,
I do take it so seriously.

1280
01:18:15,140 --> 01:18:20,140
So when I go to see them are two
things that I never make informal.

1281
01:18:21,050 --> 01:18:25,670
Like two things that I
never make informal. One is
when I talked to my board,

1282
01:18:25,671 --> 01:18:28,730
my organization board or
my group of mentors board,

1283
01:18:29,090 --> 01:18:32,320
which means I put on a
shirt, I kind of, you know,

1284
01:18:32,330 --> 01:18:36,290
I put on a jacket if it's appropriate,
I just, whatever way you want to do it,

1285
01:18:36,291 --> 01:18:39,350
and it's not about dress code,
but whatever you want to do it,

1286
01:18:39,351 --> 01:18:43,940
you want to make sure they understand
that you are using and taking their hour

1287
01:18:44,150 --> 01:18:49,130
really seriously. So just don't waste
time with that. The other thing I do,

1288
01:18:49,131 --> 01:18:50,870
I always take seriously
when I ask people for money,

1289
01:18:51,590 --> 01:18:53,780
something that I never do kind of on the,

1290
01:18:53,810 --> 01:18:58,760
I will never ask someone for a donation
or to fund conservation and tasks or

1291
01:18:58,761 --> 01:19:02,180
when I'm having a drink with them or
when I'm like fly fishing with them or

1292
01:19:02,181 --> 01:19:04,730
going on a hike with them because people
don't want to be hit up all the time

1293
01:19:04,950 --> 01:19:09,230
the same and I think you want to go do
that and like enjoy it and have fun and

1294
01:19:09,231 --> 01:19:09,921
then you want to say,

1295
01:19:09,921 --> 01:19:12,860
can I meet with you at three o'clock
tomorrow afternoon or can I meet with you

1296
01:19:12,861 --> 01:19:17,750
at 8:00 AM 8:00 AM tomorrow
today? Whatever it is you
want to like just clean up,

1297
01:19:17,751 --> 01:19:21,950
show up and be straight about it.
It's,

1298
01:19:22,590 --> 01:19:24,740
it lasts like two questions,
20 questions again,

1299
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:29,600
but when you're preparing for
one of these meetings, yeah.

1300
01:19:29,870 --> 01:19:30,703
What does it look like?

1301
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:34,760
I mean you're trying to make you have
60 minutes with such and such super hot

1302
01:19:34,761 --> 01:19:38,360
shot.
What's the format of the hour?

1303
01:19:38,780 --> 01:19:40,370
It often depends.
At this point?

1304
01:19:40,371 --> 01:19:44,450
It depends on what the major thing that
I'm dealing with as it has been and

1305
01:19:44,451 --> 01:19:46,880
what's been kind of bugging
me on my mind that I really,

1306
01:19:46,881 --> 01:19:49,430
could you give an example or is it
too personal? I mean, look good. Look,

1307
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:54,200
there's no, it is not a big surprise.
Anytime a founder leaves an organization,

1308
01:19:54,201 --> 01:19:57,860
there are, there's the, Oh, so
here's a really legitimate answer.

1309
01:19:58,040 --> 01:20:00,980
So I was not the only internal
candidate going for this job.

1310
01:20:01,670 --> 01:20:06,110
There were two other very,
very good candidates for this job as well,

1311
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:09,090
and they both could do this job.
It both could be CEOs.

1312
01:20:09,750 --> 01:20:13,560
And my number one task as soon as I
knew I was going to get this job was to

1313
01:20:13,561 --> 01:20:17,220
figure out a way to keep them.
The almost never happens,

1314
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:19,440
and I think what you've just done,

1315
01:20:19,590 --> 01:20:23,510
you've now lost the second best
person to run your organization,

1316
01:20:23,540 --> 01:20:26,490
just walk out your door.
It almost never happens.

1317
01:20:26,820 --> 01:20:30,900
So that was something I prepared for. I
thought about how I might try to project.

1318
01:20:31,050 --> 01:20:34,140
I went to them and I said, this
is a problem. It's a big problem.

1319
01:20:34,590 --> 01:20:39,420
Tell me what I need to do to be able
to do this. And they gave me some of,

1320
01:20:39,421 --> 01:20:41,790
not all of them, I mean different people.
And you've got to pick and choose.

1321
01:20:41,850 --> 01:20:46,420
You know, you've got to filter
that advice. But the two
individuals, I went to, Amy,

1322
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:51,440
incredibly good advice that I followed
to a t and it's served me well because I

1323
01:20:51,661 --> 01:20:56,640
think it's every Malbec get both those
individuals are incredibly valuable and,

1324
01:20:56,750 --> 01:21:00,240
and still part of
contribution. Well, all that.

1325
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:02,290
Thank

1326
01:21:02,290 --> 01:21:04,920
you so much.
Good advice ladies.

1327
01:21:10,510 --> 01:21:13,900
Hey guys, this is Tim again. Just a
few more things before you take off.

1328
01:21:14,230 --> 01:21:16,840
Number one.
This is five bullet Friday.

1329
01:21:17,260 --> 01:21:20,110
Do you want to get a short email from me?

1330
01:21:20,140 --> 01:21:24,280
Would you enjoy getting a short email
from me every Friday that provides a

1331
01:21:24,281 --> 01:21:26,500
little more soul of
fun before the weekend?

1332
01:21:26,820 --> 01:21:31,120
Five bullet Friday is a very short email
where I share the coolest things I've

1333
01:21:31,121 --> 01:21:33,460
found or that I've been
pondering over the week.

1334
01:21:33,700 --> 01:21:36,460
That could include favorite new
albums that I've discovered.

1335
01:21:36,461 --> 01:21:39,940
It could include Gizmos and gadgets
and all sorts of weird shit that I've

1336
01:21:39,941 --> 01:21:44,230
somehow dug up in the uh,
the world of the esoteric as I do.

1337
01:21:44,530 --> 01:21:49,530
It could include favorite articles that
I've read and that I've shared with my

1338
01:21:50,230 --> 01:21:52,900
close friends for instance.
And it's very short.

1339
01:21:52,990 --> 01:21:57,970
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness
before you head off for the weekend.

1340
01:21:58,030 --> 01:22:00,190
So if you want to receive that,
check it out.

1341
01:22:00,460 --> 01:22:05,410
Just go to four hour work week.com that's
four hour workweek.com all spelled out

1342
01:22:05,470 --> 01:22:08,290
and just drop in your email and
you will get the very next one.

1343
01:22:08,530 --> 01:22:10,360
And if you sign up,
I hope you enjoy it.

1344
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:14,290
This episode is brought
to you by 99 designs.

1345
01:22:14,291 --> 01:22:19,291
I've used 99 designs for ages since even
before podcasting was a thing and I've

1346
01:22:20,471 --> 01:22:22,390
used them for all sorts
of graphic design needs.

1347
01:22:22,420 --> 01:22:25,700
They're fast and they are convenience,
whether you need a logo,

1348
01:22:25,701 --> 01:22:29,440
a website of cover or anything else.
I've done competitions for instance,

1349
01:22:29,441 --> 01:22:31,390
for book covers related
to the four hour body.

1350
01:22:32,020 --> 01:22:37,020
99 designs makes great design accessible
to everyone and it makes the process so

1351
01:22:38,170 --> 01:22:39,280
much easier.

1352
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:44,640
And I used them recently for artwork
and illustrations inside of my Tao of

1353
01:22:46,270 --> 01:22:47,560
Seneca set of books.

1354
01:22:47,620 --> 01:22:51,130
So this is a collection of stoic
writing in modern interviews and so on.

1355
01:22:51,490 --> 01:22:55,210
So for the Tao of Seneca, I decided to
use their one to one project service.

1356
01:22:55,690 --> 01:22:59,560
In this case, you invite a
specific designer to your
project, agree on a price,

1357
01:22:59,561 --> 01:23:01,420
and then work together
until you're satisfied.

1358
01:23:01,570 --> 01:23:04,870
And the artwork just blew my,

1359
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:08,070
you have to check it out.
I kid you not.

1360
01:23:08,071 --> 01:23:13,071
And so you can check out some of the
artwork from top Seneca as well as some

1361
01:23:13,930 --> 01:23:16,600
artwork and logos and so on that
your fellow listeners had had

1362
01:23:16,601 --> 01:23:21,601
made@ninetyninedesigns.com forward slash
Tim that's nine nine designs.com/tim I

1363
01:23:23,831 --> 01:23:25,480
really suggest you check it out.

1364
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:31,080
And right now you guys can receive a
free $99 upgrade on your first project.

1365
01:23:32,920 --> 01:23:35,840
This gets you,
I think 130% more submission.

1366
01:23:35,841 --> 01:23:39,250
So people who want to work with you and
give you a first drafts of what you're

1367
01:23:39,251 --> 01:23:41,710
looking for.

forward slash. Tim,

1370
01:23:52,180 --> 01:23:56,800
this episode is brought to you by Peloton
and I'd heard about Peloton over and

1371
01:23:56,801 --> 01:24:01,270
over again, but I ended up getting
a Peloton bike in the whole system.

1372
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:05,620
After I saw my buddy Kevin Rose and
note of forever, some of you know,

1373
01:24:05,710 --> 01:24:10,710
and he showed up at my gate at my house
a while back and he looked fantastic.

1374
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:15,940
I asked him as a dude, you look great.
What the hell have you been up to?

1375
01:24:15,941 --> 01:24:18,100
Because he's always doing
a weird diet or another,

1376
01:24:18,101 --> 01:24:19,600
but it only lasts like a week or two.

1377
01:24:19,660 --> 01:24:23,470
So he always regresses to the mean
after like 75 beers and he said,

1378
01:24:23,471 --> 01:24:25,630
I've been doing peloton five days a week.

1379
01:24:25,810 --> 01:24:30,700
Now that caught my attention because Kevin
does nothing five days a week and you

1380
01:24:30,701 --> 01:24:33,940
know, I love you Kevin, but
it really peaked my curiosity.

1381
01:24:34,030 --> 01:24:39,030
Ended up getting a system and it's
become an integral part of my week.

1382
01:24:39,310 --> 01:24:43,930
I love it and I really didn't expect to
love it at all because I find cycling

1383
01:24:43,931 --> 01:24:45,460
really boring usually.

1384
01:24:45,610 --> 01:24:50,610
But peloton is an indoor cycling bike
that brings live studio classes right into

1385
01:24:50,621 --> 01:24:51,454
your home.

1386
01:24:51,490 --> 01:24:54,070
You know if worry about fitting classes
into your schedule or making into a

1387
01:24:54,071 --> 01:24:56,050
studio with some type of commute,

1388
01:24:56,070 --> 01:25:00,580
etc. New classes are added every day and
this includes options led by elite New

1389
01:25:00,580 --> 01:25:01,990
York City instructors
in your own living room.

1390
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:05,320
You can even live streams do you a
classes taught by the world's best

1391
01:25:05,321 --> 01:25:09,070
instructors or find your own favorite
class on demand. And in fact,

1392
01:25:09,071 --> 01:25:13,300
Kevin and I rarely do live classes
and you can compete with your friends,

1393
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:14,920
which is also fun.
Kevin,

1394
01:25:14,921 --> 01:25:19,060
I'm coming after you but we
usually just use classes on demand.

1395
01:25:19,210 --> 01:25:21,700
I really like Matt Wilbur's and his iron,

1396
01:25:21,730 --> 01:25:25,600
high intensity training sessions
that are shorter, like 20 minutes.

1397
01:25:26,260 --> 01:25:31,150
And I think Kevin's favorite is Alex and
everyone seems to have their favorite

1398
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:34,870
instructor or you can select
by music duration and so on.

1399
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:40,420
Each Peloton bike includes a 22 inch HD
touchscreen performance tracking metrics.

1400
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:43,370
I think that that along with
the real time leaderboard,

1401
01:25:43,390 --> 01:25:48,280
are the main reasons that this caught my
attention when cycling never had caught

1402
01:25:48,281 --> 01:25:49,390
my attention before.

1403
01:25:49,420 --> 01:25:52,900
It's really pretty stunning what they've
done with the user interface to keep

1404
01:25:52,901 --> 01:25:57,220
your attention. The belt drive is quiet
and it's smaller than you would expect,

1405
01:25:57,221 --> 01:25:59,200
so it can fit in the
living room or an office.

1406
01:25:59,230 --> 01:26:02,530
I actually have it in a large closet,
believe it or not,

1407
01:26:03,140 --> 01:26:05,190
and it fits with no problem.

1408
01:26:05,250 --> 01:26:10,220
So peloton is offering all of you guys,
listeners of the Tim Ferriss show,

1409
01:26:10,221 --> 01:26:11,510
a special offer,

1410
01:26:11,511 --> 01:26:15,320
and it is actually special
