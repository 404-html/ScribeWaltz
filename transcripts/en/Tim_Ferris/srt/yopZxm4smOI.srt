1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,850
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02,851 --> 00:00:06,950
I can run flat out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking. No else.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,020
You would pose a question.

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,620
I'm a cybernetic organism,

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:18,310
living tissue over another.

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,130
This episode is brought to you by
gymnastic bodies.com this is the training

7
00:00:28,131 --> 00:00:32,060
system that I am most obsessed with
at the moment and I don't get paid any

8
00:00:32,061 --> 00:00:33,470
commissions or anything like that.

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,340
You may have heard coach summer on
the podcast who designed the program,

10
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,520
former national team coach
for men's gymnastics.

11
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,110
I am not easily impressed and I've
just been completely blown away by the

12
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:48,470
sophistication of his programming
and the elegance of his programming.

13
00:00:48,471 --> 00:00:53,030
I've been using gymnastic bodies for
just a few months now and I feel more

14
00:00:53,031 --> 00:00:53,811
flexible,

15
00:00:53,811 --> 00:00:58,340
stronger and younger than I have in
years and it sounds cheesy to hear myself

16
00:00:58,341 --> 00:00:59,930
say that,
but it's true.

17
00:00:59,931 --> 00:01:02,870
That's the hardest part to
believe and you can check it out.

00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,340
It is incredible.

24
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:28,413
Yeah.

25
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,340
This episode is brought
to you by four sigmatic.

26
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:36,140
I reached out to these
Finnish entrepreneurs after
a very talented acrobat,

27
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:38,090
introduced me to one of their products,

28
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:43,510
which blew my mind and the best
way possible it is mushroom coffee.

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,690
What on earth is this? Well,
it includes Chaga mushroom,

30
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,720
very powerful antioxidant,
considered a super food.

31
00:01:50,721 --> 00:01:53,270
I was introduced to
Chaga by Laird Hamilton,

32
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,230
the King of Big Wave Surfing of all things
and it includes another mushroom that

33
00:01:57,231 --> 00:01:58,670
is considered a no tropic,

34
00:01:58,671 --> 00:02:02,630
a smart drug and this is lion's
mane in the entire packet.

35
00:02:02,631 --> 00:02:04,940
You just add it to hot water.
Tastes like coffee.

36
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:08,480
There is only 40 milligrams of caffeine,

37
00:02:08,481 --> 00:02:11,780
so less than half what you
would find in a cup of coffee.

38
00:02:11,781 --> 00:02:13,400
So I do not get any jitters.

39
00:02:13,401 --> 00:02:18,401
I do not get any acid reflux or any type
of stomach burn and it put me on fire

40
00:02:19,821 --> 00:02:23,420
for an entire day and I
only had half of the packet.

41
00:02:23,421 --> 00:02:25,580
So this stuff is really amazing.

42
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:29,270
People are always asking me what I use
for cognitive enhancement right now.

43
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:33,800
This is the answer. So it is legal.
It will not give you visuals.

44
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:34,813
That's something else,

45
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,650

ladies and germs.

52
00:03:00,911 --> 00:03:04,000
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another
episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

53
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:08,560
each episode I deconstruct a world class
performer to tease out the rituals,

54
00:03:08,561 --> 00:03:12,490
routines, habits, purchasing decisions,
et Cetera, that you can emulate,

55
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,660
test in your own life, whether they are
from athletics, entertainment, business,

56
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,610
military or otherwise.

57
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:23,760
This episode is a round two with dom
D'Agostino dom that is doctor Dominic

58
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:29,920
D'agostino is an assistant professor in
the department of Molecular Pharmacology

59
00:03:29,921 --> 00:03:32,410
and physiology at the
University of South Florida.

60
00:03:32,411 --> 00:03:35,650
Morsani College of medicine and that
is a mouthful and a senior research

61
00:03:35,651 --> 00:03:39,490
scientist at the Institute for
human and machine cognition IHMC.

62
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,751
He's also dead,

63
00:03:40,751 --> 00:03:45,220
lifted 500 pounds for 10
reps after a seven day fast
and I consider him a friend.

64
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:46,720
I call him,

65
00:03:46,721 --> 00:03:51,721
he's on speed dial for me with many of
my metabolic and nutritional questions

66
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,970
and many,
many of you after the last,

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,480
I think it was two to two and a half
hour conversation with dom and if you

68
00:03:58,481 --> 00:04:02,710
haven't heard that you can go to four
hour work week.com forward slash dom dom

69
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:07,000
and it will take you to that URL.
After that episode,

70
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:11,830
he and I were just delusion
with enthusiastic followup
questions about Ketosis,

71
00:04:11,831 --> 00:04:13,690
ketones, cancer, et cetera.

72
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:19,200
The following is dom answering your
most popular questions with a particular

73
00:04:20,231 --> 00:04:23,950
focus on ketones, ketosis,
ketogenetic diet, et cetera.

74
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:29,170
And for that reason you could consider
it the sort of Ketosis masterclasses,

75
00:04:29,171 --> 00:04:30,670
especially if you combine both episodes.

76
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:32,580
But this one stands alone
if you want to listen to it.

77
00:04:32,581 --> 00:04:37,000
There are a couple of things that are
not mentioned at length, uh, necessarily.

78
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:38,350
We're in detail.
For instance,

79
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:43,270
the types of canned sardines
and oysters that he eats,

80
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,340
King Oscar and wild planet foods.

81
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,420
This is from the first episode in the
show notes is where you can find the

82
00:04:49,421 --> 00:04:50,201
sardines.

83
00:04:50,201 --> 00:04:55,060
It's also why whole foods around the
country sold out of wild planet food.

84
00:04:55,061 --> 00:05:00,061
Sardines is this episode and then the
canned oysters would be crowned Prince

85
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:00,461
Natural Oysters,

86
00:05:00,461 --> 00:05:03,490
but you can find all of that in the
show notes@fourhourworkweek.com forward

87
00:05:03,491 --> 00:05:07,570
slash dom for the first episode.
And we cover a lot.

88
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,900
And what I would suggest is
dom did this on the road.

89
00:05:10,901 --> 00:05:15,070
It takes a few minutes for him
to get warmed up, be patient,

90
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,890
listened to it. And if you want to skip
around, I mean there are a few things,

91
00:05:17,891 --> 00:05:20,710
for instance around I believe
eight minutes, 55 seconds,

92
00:05:20,711 --> 00:05:23,410
let's just call it nine
minutes after this intro ends.

93
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:29,100
Can you gain muscle on the ketogenic diet
and a related questions around 52 and

94
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,230
20 seconds after this intro. How does
he handle travel? What does he pack?

95
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:40,290
And if you're really considering exploring
ketosis or just consuming exogenous

96
00:05:40,601 --> 00:05:44,830
ketones like the Kido Kana and Quito force
that I've discussed with dom and also

97
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:49,480
with Patrick Arnold, very
famous biochemist for
performance enhancing compounds,

98
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,980
shall we say.
Uh,

99
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:55,240
then this is also relevant because there
is data to suggest that you can slow,

100
00:05:55,241 --> 00:06:00,080
for instance, tumor growth by consuming
these synthetic exogenous ketones.

101
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:05,000
Even if you are still consuming
glucose or producing glucose,

102
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:09,140
which is very, very exciting for
all sorts of reasons. In any case,

103
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:14,060
this is going to be dense. It's going
to be worth it and just be patient. And,

104
00:06:14,061 --> 00:06:17,750
uh, I think that if you have an interest
in these types of metabolic therapies,

105
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:23,050
whether it is for performance enhancement
and let's say endurance or for

106
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,520
anticancer purposes or otherwise,

107
00:06:25,521 --> 00:06:28,880
that you will find a gem
within this conversation,

108
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,410
which is more of a monologue I suppose.

109
00:06:30,411 --> 00:06:32,840
So please enjoy this
conversation with dom D'Agostino.

110
00:06:32,841 --> 00:06:36,020
If you want to say hello to him,
you can certainly do so on Twitter.

111
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:40,800
It's imagine that at
Dominic d, O m I n I c. Dot.

112
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:44,840
Agastein o d a g o s t,
I and then the number two,

113
00:06:44,841 --> 00:06:46,910
I guess it was t Dominic
D'Agostino has taken.

114
00:06:46,911 --> 00:06:51,320
So at Dominic d a gusty to is his Twitter.

115
00:06:51,321 --> 00:06:53,290
And that will also be in the show notes.
Uh,

116
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:57,140
you can find all show notes at [inaudible]
four hour work week.com forward slash

117
00:06:57,141 --> 00:07:00,920
podcast. And what a fucking long
intro. I'm sorry folks. Enjoy

118
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:08,320
first question, uh, is still be
under the ketogenic diet category.

119
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,180
Under that court category is also some
questions on fasting. I think Alex,

120
00:07:13,181 --> 00:07:16,210
David writes,
despite all the evidence,

121
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:20,170
it seems that many Dietitians
and researchers, uh,

122
00:07:20,171 --> 00:07:24,740
I'd had a clinicians to that
still frown heavily on Ketosis.

123
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:26,500
Why is there so much resistance?

124
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:33,090
So I think the main reason would be
the lack of education in the medical

125
00:07:33,371 --> 00:07:37,300
community and even in
the dietetics programs.

126
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,960
So having gone through and nutrition
science program in my Undergrad,

127
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,230
um, 20 so years ago, uh,

128
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:51,290
there was a little bit of
discussion on low carb diets,

129
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:56,830
very little if any discussion
about a key to genic diet.

130
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:59,810
There was a discussion,
uh,

131
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,230
kind of a negative discussion one
day I remember on the actins Diet.

132
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:08,070
So my particular professor at the
time really sort of spies that tie.

133
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,960
So that's the problem. Like, you know,

134
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:15,840
registered dieticians who were
supposed to be at the cusp, the, the,

135
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,880
the front of,

136
00:08:16,881 --> 00:08:21,881
of understanding sort of nutrition and
how to manipulate nutrition for optimum

137
00:08:22,161 --> 00:08:23,900
health or weight loss.

138
00:08:23,901 --> 00:08:27,020
And most of the patients that they deal
with are really trying to lose weight or

139
00:08:27,021 --> 00:08:28,490
manage type two diabetes.

140
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:33,890
And we know the ketogenic diet is like a,
a big hammer,

141
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:34,311
you know,

142
00:08:34,311 --> 00:08:39,260
for type two diabetes is Jeff Volak
would say put it type two diabetic

143
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:44,150
intermission within like two weeks or so.
You could see that,

144
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,620
you know,
that that's known.

145
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:50,300
I think the big stigma comes from the
dietetic community is that it's just not

146
00:08:50,301 --> 00:08:53,810
feasible for people to follow.
And you know,

147
00:08:53,811 --> 00:08:58,050
if you lower the carbs, what type
of macro nutrient are you adding?

148
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,800
You're adding fat, right in.
Saturated fat has been demonized.

149
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:06,630
Certainly it was demonized
back when I was in, in college,

150
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,460
you know,
over 20 years ago.

151
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,050
And that's going to be hard to change.

152
00:09:13,051 --> 00:09:16,080
I think our stance on that
has softened up considerably,

153
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:21,620
but it's going to take some time to
change the minds of the people who are the

154
00:09:23,131 --> 00:09:24,240
major influencers,

155
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:28,890
which would be kind of the medical
community and dietetic program.

156
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:34,100
They need to accept that the low carb
ketogenic diet really has a place.

157
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:40,620
And right now it's really doesn't have a
place. Uh, it's getting more attention,

158
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:45,060
which is good, but it doesn't have a
place in the medical community too.

159
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:46,710
So the lack of education there.

160
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:51,300
I teach in the medical
college and I'm on the,

161
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,370
I was on the medical curriculum committee
for medical school for a number of

162
00:09:56,371 --> 00:10:00,370
years, like three years. And the,

163
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:05,540
the curriculum is already so compressed
and it's tries to fit in as much as

164
00:10:06,181 --> 00:10:07,050
possible.

165
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:12,560
The information is sort of biased if
you want to say that towards covering

166
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,450
what's on the, the boards that
the medical students have to take.

167
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:21,420
The U s Emily.
So they,

168
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:26,421
there's just no room to fit in
nutrition into the medical curriculum.

169
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:30,300
So doctors are not going to have
an appreciation of nutrition.

170
00:10:30,301 --> 00:10:33,270
There's certainly not going to have an
appreciation for the ketogenic diet.

171
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:38,510
So the medical school that I teach at
though does have a functional medicine

172
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:44,240
sort of group of kids that are very
enthusiastic and really smart and they,

173
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:48,930
they really want this
information and they have a,

174
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:54,530
a lunch sort of seminar series that they
have people come in and talk and I've

175
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,650
given a talk and my students,
uh,

176
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:59,130
are research associates
have given a talk in this.

177
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:03,530
And the feedback has been really good.
I mean they,

178
00:11:03,531 --> 00:11:07,470
they want the information but it's just
not taught in the general curriculum.

179
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,030
And it needs to be.

180
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:13,730
So nutrition is really the
foundation of our health. And uh,

181
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:18,510
and if medicine wants
to focus on prevention,

182
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:23,100
there's no better tool than nutrition.
Exercise helps,

183
00:11:23,101 --> 00:11:26,100
but probably not as good as nutrition.

184
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:30,450
So nutrition research too.
There's just a,

185
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:35,370
a lack of good research on low carb diets.

186
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,180
The ketogenic diets are sun
out there if you look, but the,

187
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,720
the rigorous sort of controlled
multi university trials,

188
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:50,800
looking at the effects of a high
carb diet verse Mediterranean verse,

189
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,620
low carb or Ketogenic Diet.

190
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:57,220
These are really difficult studies
to do and they're really expensive.

191
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,400
And uh, you know, it comes,

192
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:03,940
you have the question of who's
going to fund these studies?

193
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:08,380
What kind of institutional support
do you have to run these studies?

194
00:12:08,381 --> 00:12:12,040
Are The people at the
institute knowledgeable?

195
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:17,100
Do they have a team of Dietitians that
can control the parameters that are

196
00:12:18,701 --> 00:12:23,680
needed to ensure a diet compliance,
for example,

197
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:29,130
are they measuring blood ketones for all
the participants in the Ketogenic Diet

198
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:33,970
Group? So that rarely happens.
And that's the kind of,

199
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,290
you know,

200
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:40,290
oversight that needs to happen to
be able to do this kind of research.

201
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,830
And um,
you know,

202
00:12:41,831 --> 00:12:46,831
the research is really going to be
important because that's what the medical

203
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:51,340
community who are not taught nutrition,
that's what they're going to look at.

204
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,280
They're going to want evidence
so that they say, you know,

205
00:12:54,281 --> 00:12:58,480
if you tell them that this is a
powerful metabolic therapy and even the

206
00:12:58,481 --> 00:13:01,610
standards of care for drug
resistant or refractory epilepsy,

207
00:13:01,611 --> 00:13:05,410
it works remarkably well
for that application.

208
00:13:05,411 --> 00:13:09,910
And I think it can work equally well
for a number of other applications.

209
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:15,100
They're going to want that,
the research to support that.

210
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:21,090
And I think that research is in progress
and I think the low hanging fruit would

211
00:13:22,391 --> 00:13:25,300
be looking at type two
diabetes and obesity.

212
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:30,250
And I think that's going to be one of
the most important applications for a key

213
00:13:30,251 --> 00:13:33,250
to genic or maybe not even
KeyJack low carb diet.

214
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:37,870
So a low carb diet is
relatively easy to do,

215
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:42,930
but nutritional ketosis is considered
really considered extreme and difficult to

216
00:13:44,921 --> 00:13:48,050
implement. Right? So that's why, you know,

217
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:53,070
the question is why are researchers
or dieticians frowning on this?

218
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:58,530
So it dietician is gonna have
a difficult job getting their,

219
00:14:01,301 --> 00:14:05,710
their patients to comply with this kind
of diet. And I could just tell you,

220
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:09,490
buy people come to me and uh,

221
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,120
many of them that attempt the
Ketogenic Diet just can't follow it.

222
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:14,770
It's really hard to follow.

223
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:17,410
And that's what I think something
like a modified Atkins Diet,

224
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:21,610
you'll get four times the
amount of compliance. Uh,

225
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:25,510
if you can get maybe 10% of people
that can follow a ketogenic diet,

226
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:29,740
I would say if you screen them properly,

227
00:14:29,741 --> 00:14:34,741
you can get at least 40% of the people
to adhere to and modify ketogenic diet

228
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:41,700
defined as sort of following in a way
that they consistently have an elevation

229
00:14:44,591 --> 00:14:49,160
of blood ketones day in and day out.
So it's just a much easier diet to follow.

230
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,800
Talk a little bit more about that.

231
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:56,150
A leader I think with questions and
there's also some resistance from the

232
00:14:56,181 --> 00:15:00,770
exercise community too. Um, if
people, the question is what do you,

233
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,960
what are you using the Ketogenic Diet for?

234
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,440
And there's clearly saw on social media,

235
00:15:06,441 --> 00:15:11,441
there's a lot of talk and discussion
and debate about the ketogenic diet for

236
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,040
endurance athletes,
long distance runners.

237
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:19,220
And I think it definitely
has an application.

238
00:15:19,221 --> 00:15:22,490
They're bigger question that I get a lot.

239
00:15:22,491 --> 00:15:27,491
Is it the ideal diet or can you
gain muscle size and strength,

240
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:33,060
you know, doing resistance
training, doing bodybuilding power,

241
00:15:33,061 --> 00:15:37,730
lifting with a ketogenic diet. And
I think you can, I know you can,

242
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:40,040
uh, the question is,
you know, is it optimal?

243
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:43,670
Probably not for everybody,

244
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,730
but I think it is for,

245
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:51,830
I think it can be for a
subpopulation of people.

246
00:15:51,831 --> 00:15:53,480
And I think, you know, as we age,

247
00:15:53,481 --> 00:15:57,680
our carbohydrate tolerance
decreases with age.

248
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,100
So the,

249
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:04,450
the over 40 crowd and I would fit into
that response remarkably well to a

250
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:09,860
ketogenic diet, I think in the context of
resistance training or a low carb diet.

251
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:15,350
But we really need more research on that.
So hopefully we're, we plan to do that.

252
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:19,580
So, um, uh, the next question probably
spent too long on that question,

253
00:16:19,581 --> 00:16:21,260
so I'll try to hit these more rapid fire.

254
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,990
The next question comes from Grad Gross.

255
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:29,500
Could you please ask him
about protein intake, uh,

256
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:31,460
on,
on Ketosis.

257
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:36,520
So it seems like there's a thousands
of different answers out there to this

258
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,870
question.
And yes,

259
00:16:38,871 --> 00:16:43,871
everybody's got an answer to how much
protein you should take on a ketogenic

260
00:16:44,751 --> 00:16:45,231
diet.

261
00:16:45,231 --> 00:16:50,231
So in the case of me and then the case
in the context of treating kids with

262
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:53,660
epilepsy,

263
00:16:53,661 --> 00:16:58,661
it's been found that keeping your protein
between one and 1.5 grams per kilogram

264
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:01,190
per day is really,

265
00:17:01,191 --> 00:17:06,191
you need to kind of stay within that
range to consistently stay in nutritional

266
00:17:07,131 --> 00:17:12,131
ketosis as protein is can be insulinogenic
so you could excess protein can feed

267
00:17:16,131 --> 00:17:21,131
into gluconeogenic pathway and kick you
out of Ketosis or decrease your ketone

268
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:23,280
levels.
Um,

269
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:27,740
so I would say the higher protein though
is probably needed in people that are

270
00:17:27,741 --> 00:17:30,050
more active and also heavy training.

271
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:35,680
And I think when you get the person
who's an ectomorph and is super fast

272
00:17:35,991 --> 00:17:40,320
metabolism and maybe on top
of that, you know, from mine,

273
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:44,440
he's an Ectomorph and he has a very
high output, you know, cause he,

274
00:17:44,441 --> 00:17:49,441
he works outside all day so he
needs two grams per kilogram day.

275
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:52,050
And that would,

276
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:57,160
that's typically far above what most
people would take for a ketogenic diet.

277
00:17:57,811 --> 00:18:02,811
But his ketones stave remarkably high
off fat cause its output is really high.

278
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:07,860
Uh, typical ketogenic diet, quote
unquote, the classical ketogenic diet,

279
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:13,110
a four to one ratio, four parts
fat, one part combination protein,

280
00:18:13,111 --> 00:18:18,111
carbs has like 10% calories coming
from protein that's really low.

281
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,400
So a modified ketogenic diet is 25 to
30% calories and protein from protein

282
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:35,600
percentage protein. And that's also
called the modified Atkins Diet. And, uh,

283
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:40,800
it really evolved out of work done
at Johns Hopkins. Uh, Eric Kossoff.

284
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:41,440
Uh,

285
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,440
it was probably the leader in sort
of advancing the modified Atkins as a

286
00:18:46,741 --> 00:18:51,510
metabolic therapy for, for uh,
kids and adults with the seizures.

287
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,190
And that's really the Diet that,
that a lot of athletes are using.

288
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:59,700
So my,
myself included kind of not an athlete,

289
00:18:59,701 --> 00:19:03,750
but I think most of the people who say
they're on a ketogenic diet are not doing

290
00:19:03,751 --> 00:19:07,470
the classical ketogenic diet,
which is like 10% protein.

291
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:10,890
So yeah,
the protein intake,

292
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,380
very general recommendation,

293
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:17,880
one to 1.5 grams per kilogram.

00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:26,900
So it's an interesting situations that
I have a type one diabetic student in my

296
00:19:28,831 --> 00:19:33,810
lab and he's a phd student. Remarkable
student, Vic guys, six, four,

297
00:19:33,811 --> 00:19:36,540
250. Uh, Andrew Coot.

298
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:41,541
Nick is his name and join the lab with
an intense interest in this subject and

299
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:47,870
took it upon himself to try the
ketogenic diet as a type one diabetic.

300
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,370
Right? So, um,

301
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:55,490
he tracks everything including his blood
glucose continuously cause he has one

302
00:19:57,451 --> 00:19:58,260
of the,
uh,

303
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:02,940
sort of Dex con units that continuously
measures his blood glucose levels.

304
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:04,070
And,
um,

305
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:09,950
he's a remarkable subject for testing
ketogenic food products because we could

306
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:15,420
just turn his insulin off so he has a
glucose monitoring system and an insulin

307
00:20:15,421 --> 00:20:16,254
pump.

308
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:21,680
If we want to examine the glycaemic
index or the glycaemic response,

309
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:28,140
I guess you would say at different foods,
we can use Andrew and turn off his, uh,

310
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:31,380
his insulin pump and then look at his,
uh,

311
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:35,870
glycaemic response to the food.
So it comes in very handy. Uh,

312
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:38,760
so Andrew,
uh,

313
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
is a great sport and he decided to try
the Ketogenic Diet and his written up

314
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:50,660
some notes here that things just
sort of describing his response to,

315
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,413
to the Diet.

316
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,150
And Andrew kind of is very,

317
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:03,310
um, kind of perceptive about
many different things, including,

318
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,920
uh,
his insulin sensitivity.

319
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:11,070
So he has a really good handle on
how changes in his body composition,

320
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,350
his exercise.

321
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:19,420
So when he does kind of brutal
exercises training in the gym, uh,

322
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:24,370
the frequency that consistency,
uh, how that affects his,

323
00:21:24,371 --> 00:21:25,570
his blood glucose,

324
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:30,630
that type of insulin that he uses and
how that influences his caffeine use is

325
00:21:31,811 --> 00:21:36,160
fiber, the composition of
his meal, the types of foods,

326
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,280
what he adds to his foods,
things like cinnamon.

327
00:21:39,281 --> 00:21:43,900
So he's tracked like all
these different variables and,

328
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:48,760
and how these variables influence his
blood glucose and the amount of insulin

329
00:21:48,761 --> 00:21:52,830
that he needs.
When he got around to the Ketogenic Diet,

330
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:57,840
he realized there was some really big
perks to being a type one diabetic and

331
00:22:00,581 --> 00:22:01,750
being on a kid Jank Diet.

332
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:06,280
And the biggest would be the lack
of blood glucose fluctuations.

333
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:11,940
So tremendous difference between a in
glucose fluctuations on a high carb diet

334
00:22:15,401 --> 00:22:16,810
versus the Ketogenic Diet.

335
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,960
The daily fluctuations were remarkably
tighter and he's been conversing with

336
00:22:22,511 --> 00:22:27,511
other type two diabetics who have
switched from the Diet that they have been

337
00:22:28,361 --> 00:22:33,160
prescribed and the
ketogenic diet. And, um,

338
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:36,480
I mean it's, it's amazing the, uh,

339
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:41,940
the control of blood glucose that you
have when you're on a ketogenic diet and

340
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,270
not only is your blood glucose,
his blood glucose,

341
00:22:46,271 --> 00:22:51,271
remarkably a kind of controlled
when he switched to ketogenic diet,

342
00:22:51,341 --> 00:22:55,400
but he was able to reduce
his insulin levels, uh,

343
00:22:55,450 --> 00:23:00,160
to about one third of the amount of
insulin that he was using before.

344
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:05,700
So whenever you can reduce the amount of
insulin for a type one diabetic can do

345
00:23:06,971 --> 00:23:10,630
that, that's a good thing. So, um,

346
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:15,010
doctors need to acknowledge
that. So he, uh,

347
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,720
had a similar reduction
in 24 hour insulin levels,

348
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,720
uh,
or no hidden in his notes here.

349
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:27,610
He noted that there was a similar
reduction in 24 hour insulin levels,

350
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:32,110
uh, reported in individuals
who were underweight, uh,

351
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:35,710
who underwent and ketogenic diet,
but maintain body weight. So,

352
00:23:35,711 --> 00:23:39,850
and he lists a number of different
publications to support sort of the same

353
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:44,851
observation that he saw when he switched
from a high carb diet to a ketogenic

354
00:23:45,561 --> 00:23:50,030
diet for managing his type one diabetes.

355
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:54,530
Uh, his insulin sensitivity
increase tremendously.

356
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:59,150
So in this has major implications,
uh,

357
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,740
potential protection against
hypoglycemia, right? Uh,

358
00:24:03,741 --> 00:24:06,260
in my talks, I always talk
about the work of, uh,

359
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:11,350
George Cahill from Harvard in 1967 and
the mid sixties and 1967 he published

360
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:19,190
then observation fastest subjects who
when adapted to a state of starvation,

361
00:24:21,621 --> 00:24:26,621
ketosis were remarkably resilient
against insulin induced hypoglycemia.

362
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,121
Uh,

363
00:24:29,121 --> 00:24:34,121
so they suppressed their blood glucose
levels with ivy infuse insulin down to

364
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:41,770
something between one to 2 million molar.

365
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:46,040
And that would be kind of universally,
if not fatal,

366
00:24:46,041 --> 00:24:50,480
would put someone into a
coma or a seizure. So, uh,

367
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:56,320
and we know that having blood ketones
elevated make you remarkably protected

368
00:24:58,041 --> 00:24:59,240
against hypoglycemia.

369
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:04,240
So that has real practical
consequences from a safety standpoint.

370
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:09,380
Uh, if you're driving, you know,
how many accidents are caused by,

371
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:14,270
uh, or result from hypoglycemia
and people who are diabetic.

372
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:19,010
So that much of that could probably be
mitigated if they were on a ketogenic

373
00:25:19,011 --> 00:25:21,800
diet.
So these benefits,

374
00:25:21,801 --> 00:25:25,460
and he described many benefits,
you know,

375
00:25:25,461 --> 00:25:30,461
in our daily talks in the lab and these
benefits essentially eliminate the

376
00:25:30,621 --> 00:25:34,310
potential downside of type one diabetes.

377
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:39,290
Uh, initially the short term
and the long term, right?

378
00:25:39,291 --> 00:25:42,170
So short term you're talking,
you know,

379
00:25:42,171 --> 00:25:44,390
acute hypoglycemia,

380
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:48,080
mitigating that is really
important but also the long term.

381
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:53,110
So if you're on a high carbohydrate
diet and you have huge postprandial

382
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,500
excursions in your blood glucose,

383
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,140
that's gonna and you do that repeatedly,

384
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:04,850
that that's gonna cause a lot of
harm, you know, in the longterm.

385
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:10,030
And that can be completely eliminated
or significantly attenuated in type one

386
00:26:11,271 --> 00:26:16,271
diabetics using a low carb approach
or a ketogenic diet approach.

387
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:23,290
So I noticed a controversial subject
and I don't want to kind of base my

388
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:28,870
comments or suggestions
off, you know, the,

389
00:26:28,871 --> 00:26:33,871
the people that communicate to me and
seeing firsthand what it did to Andrew who

390
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:39,550
not only has much better control over
is type one diabetes but is incredibly,

391
00:26:42,141 --> 00:26:47,141
has incredible amount of muscle and
strength and continues to surpass a lot of

392
00:26:49,021 --> 00:26:54,021
his lifts in the gym while following
a ketogenic diet or low carb approach.

393
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:59,370
So He's more or less transitions from a
ketogenic diet to low carb and kind of

394
00:26:59,371 --> 00:27:02,970
bounces back and forth then stay,
keep genic all the time now.

395
00:27:02,971 --> 00:27:07,971
But he told me that he feels best while
he's on a ketogenic diet and certainly

396
00:27:07,981 --> 00:27:09,510
uses much less insulin.

397
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:13,620
So there's some resources
out there to point people to,

398
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:17,730
cause I do get about at least one
or two questions are week on this.

399
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:22,730
I would point people to the ketogenic
diet for type one diabetes ebook and

400
00:27:24,061 --> 00:27:29,061
that's on ketogenic diet resource.com
and the authors of those books are Ellen

401
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,750
Davis and Dr. Keith Runyan.

402
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:37,780
And I knew doctor Runyon has been on
several podcasts talking about his use key

403
00:27:38,731 --> 00:27:42,600
is a type one diabetic. He's a
medical doctor with type one diabetes.

404
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:48,040
Next question I want to address is
by Oh Himba narco swath and asked the

405
00:27:50,491 --> 00:27:53,880
question kenogenic breath
analyzer versus blood.

406
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:57,420
So which one,
which one's best here?

407
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:02,990
So the blood glucose slash
ketone meter by Abbott labs,

408
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:08,270
the precision Xtra and one that I
use personally is the freestyle Neal,

409
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:10,523
I think it's called.

410
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:14,910
It's really the gold standard if you're
getting into this and you want to,

411
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,620
if you're not on a tight budget,

412
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:21,890
I would recommend measuring every day if
you're really serious and to do it the

413
00:28:22,081 --> 00:28:26,220
same time of day every day.
And I think that's really important.

414
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:31,440
And the breath acetone meter,
uh,

415
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,850
that would be the,
uh,

416
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:38,060
the ketone tonics meter is really
useful and it just really needs more

417
00:28:39,031 --> 00:28:42,990
development and testing
from my perspective. Um,

418
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:47,220
so we know from at least, you know, one,

419
00:28:47,221 --> 00:28:52,170
maybe two studies breath acetone
levels correlate with seizure control.

420
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:57,410
So I think if you have kids that are
managing a disorder and they don't want to

421
00:28:58,381 --> 00:29:02,250
be their fingers, you know,
prefer not to be pricked.

422
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:07,080
I think these breath acetone
meters are great for kids.

423
00:29:07,081 --> 00:29:09,120
And I've talked to,
you know,

424
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,780
parents and kids that enjoy doing them.

425
00:29:12,781 --> 00:29:15,600
Kids you blow in and you have
like these pretty colors.

426
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:21,020
You get the blue and with low ketones
are green and then orange and yellow I

427
00:29:23,281 --> 00:29:27,030
think in red. So they're
very convenient, uh,

428
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:32,090
for giving you a range of breath
acetone that can correlate with seizure

429
00:29:34,471 --> 00:29:39,430
control. So I think more work needs
to be sort of done with them. Um,

430
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:44,750
they're noninvasive and I think there's
what I'm interested in and is actually

431
00:29:46,331 --> 00:29:51,331
using these devices to look at other
volatile organic compounds that may be

432
00:29:52,061 --> 00:29:55,450
important. Health biomarkers
for example. You know,

433
00:29:55,451 --> 00:29:58,810
it gives you information
on oxidative stress,

434
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:02,380
so you have things like Iso Cross Danes,
uh,

435
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:07,410
things that could detect from what I'm
interested in is like oxygen toxicity,

436
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,150
pulmonary oxygen toxicity,
uh,

437
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:15,180
will kind of be characterized by blowing
off certain Baltara organic compounds.

438
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:20,731
And I think our gut microbiome
to influence the gut
microbiome will influence

439
00:30:21,521 --> 00:30:24,280
the volatile organic compounds
that are coming out of our mouth.

440
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,080
And I think these things can be picked up.

441
00:30:26,081 --> 00:30:31,081
And once we understand and we can develop
devices to measure these things in our

442
00:30:31,931 --> 00:30:36,200
breath and I think don't, no
one has done it yet, but I,

443
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:41,110
I don't know why it's not possible,
but saliva ketone measurements,

444
00:30:41,111 --> 00:30:44,950
I think that might be, you
know, something to look into.

445
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,470
So if anyone out there is listening,

446
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:52,530
so maybe a saliva ketone
measurement system could be useful.

447
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:57,160
The next question is Jeff
Henderson and he writes,

448
00:30:57,161 --> 00:31:02,161
I'd be really curious about how ketosis
affects performance at altitude.

449
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:06,460
So I live in big sky,
Montana,

450
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,150
do a lot of back country ski touring,

451
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,040
climbing mountaineering.

452
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:16,840
I've noticed a significant
performance increase while in ketosis.

453
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:21,841
I'm currently trying to get in a friend's
willing to do a ketogenic diet so I

454
00:31:22,481 --> 00:31:27,460
can put together an actual experiment
with a decent sized Dataset.

455
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:31,570
So I don't know what he
measure. If he did that. Uh,

456
00:31:31,571 --> 00:31:34,660
we'd love to hear dumps
thoughts on this. Okay. Um,

457
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:40,350
so there's any increase in brain
blood flow when you are in a state of

458
00:31:41,051 --> 00:31:42,370
nutritional ketosis.

459
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:46,930
So that may reverse some of the,

460
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:52,090
the things that we know happen as
a response to altitude. There's,

461
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:57,520
uh, some individuals can have hypo
Kapnik cerebral vasoconstriction,

462
00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:01,920
so that could maybe be reversed
or mitigated in part, uh,

463
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:05,270
with nutritional ketosis,
there's also things like, uh,

464
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:10,290
at altitude you can have an increased
intercranial pressure and uh,

465
00:32:11,681 --> 00:32:16,060
the Diet actually has, uh, uh,
well-described diuretic effect.

466
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:17,020
It's fairly mild,

467
00:32:17,021 --> 00:32:22,021
but it can maybe reduce
some of the intercranial
pressure that people at really

468
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:27,580
high altitudes can experience.
So we know too that, uh,

469
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:31,260
the energy production and our,

470
00:32:31,261 --> 00:32:36,261
our bodies in general probably
can generate energy more
efficiently with ketones

471
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:42,740
than it can with other types of
fuels with glucose in particular.

472
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:47,090
And then we can probably derive
more energy per oxygen molecule.

473
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:52,660
And I would probably direct you to some
of the work that was done by Richard

474
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,100
Veech is lab.

475
00:32:55,100 --> 00:33:00,100
And they did work with a working profused
heart preparation and they looked at

476
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:07,280
the delta g of ATP hydrolysis and they
look at the hydraulic efficiency of the

477
00:33:07,281 --> 00:33:11,060
heart, which increased
significantly when, uh,

478
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:15,110
the preparation was perfused
with ketones relative to glucose.

479
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:16,760
Right?

480
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:21,760
So there's also a book written by Andrew
Murray and Hugh Montgomery and that

481
00:33:23,211 --> 00:33:25,490
book, the title of it, uh,

482
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:30,520
how wasting is saving weight loss at
altitude might result from an evolutionary

483
00:33:32,541 --> 00:33:33,500
adaptation.

484
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:39,700
So this will kind of describes
how nutritional ketosis
may mitigate some of the

485
00:33:41,691 --> 00:33:44,840
weight loss that's associated
with being at altitude.

486
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:50,660
Peter at Tia also give a talk,
if I remember correctly at Ihmc,

487
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:53,090
if you Google Peter Tia Ihmc lecture,

488
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:58,450
he gave a discussion on the performance
enhancement as facts that he had with

489
00:33:59,301 --> 00:34:03,410
the Ketogenic Diet and also
describes cycling at high altitude.

490
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:05,090
Uh,

491
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:10,090
I think the balance of the data from a
scientific perspective and from feedback

492
00:34:10,971 --> 00:34:15,971
that I get would suggest that being in
a state of Ketosis can enhance exercise

493
00:34:18,321 --> 00:34:20,450
performance at altitude.

494
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:26,000
Another person I think communicating
with recently is Patrick Sweeney. Uh,

495
00:34:26,001 --> 00:34:30,740
he t he actually recently teamed up
with Professional Mountain biker.

496
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,770
Rebecca Rush I think is her name.

497
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:39,220
And they did a climb and descend a on
Mount Kilimanjaro on their mountain bikes.

498
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:45,410
Right?
So this was a mountain bike climb and the,

499
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:49,100
the mission was totally self supported,

500
00:34:49,101 --> 00:34:53,690
meaning that they didn't have any porters
to carry their bags or anything and

501
00:34:53,691 --> 00:34:58,690
they didn't, they abstained from
using, uh, see it as old mine,

502
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:02,090
which is diamox the medication
that you take for altitude.

503
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:05,600
And so they didn't get altitude sickness.

504
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:08,870
So the goal of what they're trying to do,

505
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:11,690
Patrick Sweeney and we're bucket brush,

506
00:35:11,691 --> 00:35:16,691
the goal of the expedition was to raise
$1 for every foot of climbing they did.

507
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:23,770
So that amounted to a little over
$19,000 for an organization called world

508
00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:26,210
bicycle relief.

509
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:31,840
And Patrick had communicated with me
prior to attempting this Mount Kilimanjaro

510
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:36,020
bike ride and uh,

511
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:40,740
and it kind of coached him a little bit
and just talked about the Ketogenic Diet

512
00:35:40,741 --> 00:35:44,650
and how you do it and sent
a number of emails. Um,

513
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:50,060
just Google Patrick Sweeney bike ride
and should bring you probably to this

514
00:35:50,431 --> 00:35:53,400
event and get,
gives you more information on it.

515
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:57,780
And the next question is from
Lindsey Watkins in Z ass.

516
00:35:57,781 --> 00:36:02,781
I'd like to hear about any
differences or considerations females,

517
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:06,300
uh,
need to have with the ketogenic diet.

518
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:11,490
So what I've observed is that,
uh,

519
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:15,570
and this may even apply
to our rodent models, uh,

520
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:20,630
the transition into ketosis can be
more difficult for females in general.

521
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:26,730
It seems that they're more
variable in their responses.

522
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:31,500
Reactive, I would say to low blood
glucose levels, especially initially.

523
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:37,700
And I would recommend that a female's
trying this sort of ease into it,

524
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:44,280
uh,
before just going all out ketogenic.

525
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:48,630
And so it was slow transition
into a ketogenic diet,

526
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:53,690
maybe dropping your
carbohydrates if you're at 200
down to 150 and just do it in

527
00:36:54,661 --> 00:36:57,750
50 gram increments and titrating it down.

528
00:36:57,751 --> 00:37:02,550
Another option would be the use
of exogenous ketones. You know,

529
00:37:02,551 --> 00:37:05,790
when you go on a ketogenic diet,

530
00:37:05,791 --> 00:37:10,791
your brain goes through what I'd call
glucose withdrawal effects and you might

531
00:37:11,611 --> 00:37:16,350
be able to fill that gap initially
until your body starts making ketones.

532
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:20,580
Upregulating the transport
and utilization of ketones.

533
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:25,560
You might be able to fill that gap by
taking exogenous ketones are just simply

534
00:37:25,561 --> 00:37:27,930
using something like
medium chain triglyceride.

535
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:33,230
The C eight would be the kind of
the most key to genic fat out there.

536
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:38,990
Another issue that females run into is
that when a lot of women start this,

537
00:37:39,181 --> 00:37:43,500
they tend to start a ketogenic
diet in a calorie deficit.

538
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:48,270
So they go right into a calorie
restricted ketogenic diet.

539
00:37:48,271 --> 00:37:52,740
So you have sort of the double
whammy. You have, uh, no glucose,

540
00:37:52,741 --> 00:37:57,741
very little glucose getting to the brain
and then calorie restriction on top of

541
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:04,170
a radical shift in macro
nutrient profile of their diet.

542
00:38:04,171 --> 00:38:08,130
And so that they're going to get
a reactive response from that

543
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:13,200
hypoglycemia. And, uh,

544
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:18,590
in some women it can manifest itself
in a strange ways from fainting to

545
00:38:20,071 --> 00:38:24,210
irritability to foggy headedness.
Um,

546
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:26,670
so the idea would be,

547
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:32,210
my suggestion would be to keep your,

548
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:37,090
your calories actually higher
when you start QT tank diet.

549
00:38:37,091 --> 00:38:41,800
So you want a calorie surplus at least
initially to help with the transition

550
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:44,440
that's high in fat to do,

551
00:38:44,441 --> 00:38:47,020
not as hard for some people,

552
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:50,610
especially in the fitness industry
when they started to Jank by it,

553
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:54,070
they have to be, uh, not
afraid of eating fat.

554
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:59,470
So, you know, a hundred
grams of fat per day.

555
00:38:59,471 --> 00:39:04,210
It is really not a lot of fat.
Some getting upwards of about 200,

556
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:06,910
250,
300 even on some days.

557
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:09,700
So for the average size female,

558
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:15,090
you want to get at least a
hundred grams of fat upwards to,

559
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,670
you know,
depending on your size and your output,

560
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:20,320
maybe even up to 200 grams of fat.

561
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:26,390
That would be my suggestions there
to help with with females. Uh,

562
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:32,040
now the hormonal changes that have been
reported by some females following a

563
00:39:33,641 --> 00:39:36,220
ketogenic diet,
suppression of thyroid.

564
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:40,870
So I'm just looking through my
emails here, different females. Uh,

565
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:45,700
yeah,
that seems to be sort of the,

566
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:50,080
one of the major concerns, uh,
when I probe a little deeper,

567
00:39:50,081 --> 00:39:53,020
the people that are getting,
you know,

568
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:55,690
a suppression of some of their hormones,

569
00:39:55,720 --> 00:40:00,310
they're exercising a minimum of two,

570
00:40:00,311 --> 00:40:03,340
sometimes four,
six hours a day training for an event.

571
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:09,060
So the scenario that you have is you're
transitioning your body to a new diet,

572
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:13,930
high carb to low carb on
top of calorie restriction.

573
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:19,440
Do you do have an energy deficits that's
caused by a restriction of calories,

574
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:20,831
it appears.

575
00:40:20,831 --> 00:40:25,831
And also overtraining and
overtraining is the fastest way to,

576
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:31,160
uh, to really kick down your hormones. Uh,

577
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:34,270
for males,
manifest is low testosterone.

578
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:38,620
For females it can manifest
in many different ways.

579
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:43,580
Most the thing that I see most
is a reduction and t three.

580
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:48,810
So the next question comes
from Cammie Orion and she asks,

581
00:40:50,081 --> 00:40:55,081
can a female obtain a sub 10%
body fat with a Ketogenic Diet?

582
00:40:57,010 --> 00:40:58,090
And if so,

583
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:03,270
is there a daily Calorie
threshold relative to my
basal metabolic rate or other

584
00:41:04,421 --> 00:41:07,420
factors to reach that level of body fat?

585
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,330
Also kind of another common question,

586
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,900
women wanting to do the ketogenic
diet to get as lean as possible.

587
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:18,880
Of course there's a lot of women in the
fitness industry or fitness competitors

588
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:23,950
that are using this approach.
So at, so the first question is,

589
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,600
I don't know what she's doing.

590
00:41:25,601 --> 00:41:30,601
If this is for a cosmetic reasons or
if she is an athlete and wanting just

591
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:38,300
perform as optimally as
possible and thinks she gets
needs to get below 10% body

592
00:41:38,301 --> 00:41:39,110
fat.

593
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:43,610
So the first question I would have for
her is why do you want to get below 10%

594
00:41:43,611 --> 00:41:44,444
body fat?

595
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:49,810
So essential fat from my understanding
in women is between eight and 12% so

596
00:41:53,031 --> 00:41:58,031
roughly 10% fat is needed for normal
physiological hormonal and body functions

597
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,133
and women.

598
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:06,760
And I think it's important to keep above
that and it's highly dependent upon the

599
00:42:08,001 --> 00:42:08,990
person.
You know,

600
00:42:08,991 --> 00:42:13,310
some women are just naturally very lean
and and other women have a higher set

601
00:42:13,311 --> 00:42:14,000
point.

602
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I would advise against trying to achieve
a 10% body fat for performance unless

603
00:42:20,631 --> 00:42:24,500
you're genetically exceptionally
lean to begin with.

604
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:29,600
When highly trained women
at just 15% body fat,

605
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:31,910
which is very lean for women,

606
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:35,120
trains and diets to sub 10% body fat,

607
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:39,290
they tend to get these hormonal issues.
Uh,

608
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:43,430
I would call it functional
hypothalmic amenorrhea.

609
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:47,000
So it even has a term,
I believe,

610
00:42:47,001 --> 00:42:52,001
I just read an article on this and
this is extremely common in the fitness

611
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:58,550
industry and, and sometimes it's
not easily, readily reversible.

612
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:02,040
So if a ketogenic diet approach is use,

613
00:43:02,041 --> 00:43:05,480
it will be a greater fat turnover.

614
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:10,630
And I would advise sort of like the last
question against consuming less than

615
00:43:10,971 --> 00:43:12,980
100 grams of fat.

616
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:18,020
So some of the macros that were sent to
me by women that were doing a ketogenic

617
00:43:18,021 --> 00:43:20,870
diet or like 60 grams of fat,

618
00:43:21,290 --> 00:43:24,770
upwards of 70 and 80 grams of fat,
and they thought that was very high.

619
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,390
So I would event,

620
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:30,980
I would advise against consuming
less than 100 grams fat,

621
00:43:30,981 --> 00:43:32,600
especially for a female athlete.

622
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:37,700
So consuming this high level of fat keeps
your fat metabolism sort of optimized.

623
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:42,680
And uh, it also, you
know, is the source of,

624
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:45,050
of ketones is making ketones.

625
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:51,280
So probably the most
experienced individuals on
this topic achieving some 10%

626
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:57,190
body fat would be female fitness
competitors who routinely get below 10%.

627
00:43:58,070 --> 00:44:03,070
And this mentioned that they do report
a lot of ministration irregularities for

628
00:44:05,251 --> 00:44:10,190
women who have successfully implemented
a huge ANC diet and are aware of how to

629
00:44:10,191 --> 00:44:14,930
do so. This is some of the women
that come to mind would be uh,

630
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,280
Shannon,
uh,

631
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:22,330
Pena or Shannon Yorkton Pena from
quest nutrition who is really a very

632
00:44:23,571 --> 00:44:28,190
experienced fitness competitor and
just an overall great person around.

633
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:31,180
And she has,
um,

634
00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:36,950
been in a state of Ketosis I
think for at least two years now.

635
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:43,460
And quest nutrition is
sort of developing testing.

636
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:48,030
Ultimately there'll be marketing
ketogenic diet food products.

637
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:53,160
They already have the quest MCT
oil powder, which is fantastic.

638
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:57,930
So the next question comes
from Renee volt show.

639
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:03,560
How does ketosis affect the Microbiota
specifically that balance of for making

640
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:07,400
ease to bacteria?

641
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:13,550
So that's a great question and it's
highly dependent upon the Diet that you're

642
00:45:15,061 --> 00:45:17,460
following, right? It's really,

643
00:45:17,610 --> 00:45:22,610
we're just at the cusp of
understanding the gut microbiome.

644
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,350
And there's,

645
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:31,370
so relating this question to the key to
genic diet and to give an answer on it,

646
00:45:31,711 --> 00:45:36,540
it is kind of difficult because there's
many variations of the key to genic diet,

647
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:36,801
right?

648
00:45:36,801 --> 00:45:41,801
The modified Atkins would be much more
liberal in the amount of vegetables that

649
00:45:42,061 --> 00:45:46,980
you consume. What I've garnered
just from reading what I can, uh,

650
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:51,480
as far as studies that have been
done that and talking with, uh,

651
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:56,660
the scientists who were at this area of
research is that you can train your gut

652
00:45:57,061 --> 00:45:59,520
microbiome to sort of be key to genic.

653
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:03,150
There's bacterial species in your gut.

654
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:05,400
And I don't know,

655
00:46:05,401 --> 00:46:09,240
I have a list of them that
actually thrive off fat.

656
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:13,230
And these bacterial species
tend to be the beneficial ones.

657
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:17,760
They're very good for us.
So that changes dramatically.

658
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:20,940
You know,
as when we change our diet,

659
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:26,000
our gut microbiome also changes it's diet
and we'll adjust the ratios of various

660
00:46:29,850 --> 00:46:34,850
species in the gut and a shift towards
more bacterial species that thrive off

661
00:46:35,431 --> 00:46:38,400
fat. My general recommendations, uh,

662
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:43,460
to optimize the microbiome and my
knowledge is nowhere near that of,

663
00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:47,850
you know,
researchers out there like Alessio Fasano.

664
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:51,810
I'm just the chair of pediatrics
at Harvard Medical School. Uh,

665
00:46:51,811 --> 00:46:56,130
he actually gave it
fantastic IHMC lecture.

666
00:46:56,550 --> 00:47:01,230
So IHMC is the Institute for Human and
machine cognition lecture on this topic.

667
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:06,260
So I would recommend that listeners
go to that lecture and uh,

668
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:10,360
and look up, uh, Alesio Fasano. Uh,

669
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,360
he does not study the ketogenic diet,

670
00:47:12,361 --> 00:47:17,361
but he's the leading expert and most
knowledgeable person out there on the gut

671
00:47:18,061 --> 00:47:22,650
microbiome.
So for those following a ketogenic diet,

672
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:27,990
things that I think could optimize the
microbiome would be sort of the obvious

673
00:47:27,991 --> 00:47:32,560
things we always talk about or
hear about would be probiotics.

674
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:37,600
So green vegetables,
preferably in a raw form,

675
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:41,290
salads, things like
asparagus, trying to think.

676
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:46,291
Artichoke cinnamon is kind
of prebiotic and probiotics.

677
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:50,020
So lactobacillus Bifidus,

678
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:54,880
there's a number of other bacteria
out there that could be supplemented,

679
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:56,940
don't have,

680
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:01,690
I don't feel like the cute Jank diet
would compromise the gut microbiome in any

681
00:48:01,691 --> 00:48:06,160
way, even in those
individuals that limit their,

682
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:07,420
their fiber.

683
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:11,980
So I haven't heard that that's
been a problem for them,

684
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:17,160
but to prevent it from being a potential
problem they use of these prebiotics

685
00:48:17,231 --> 00:48:20,860
and probiotics,
fermented foods,

686
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:26,410
things like sour cream are part of my
diet and it's important to pick a sour

687
00:48:26,411 --> 00:48:31,411
cream that has a good compliment
of a live cultures in it too.

688
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:35,080
Another thing that people
have emailed me about,

689
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:40,560
and I think Rhonda Patrick
Actually mentioned this to
me in passing and a couple

690
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:45,010
people emailed me about the
benefits of a supplement.

691
00:48:45,011 --> 00:48:49,150
It's called V s l three or
VSL number three supplement.

692
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:54,610
And I think that, uh, I
haven't taken it myself,

693
00:48:54,611 --> 00:48:58,410
but just from the number of emails
I got from people who have taken the

694
00:48:58,411 --> 00:49:02,020
supplement and they've taken
it with a ketogenic diet,

695
00:49:02,290 --> 00:49:06,820
not that they had problems
before the ketogenic diet,

696
00:49:06,821 --> 00:49:09,880
but they felt that it was a good
compliment to the key to genic diet.

697
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,720
The VSL three supplement
is a probiotic supplement.

698
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:19,540
It's used for people, people with
Crohn's disease, Colitis, IBS,

699
00:49:19,870 --> 00:49:23,710
if you've used an antibiotic,
which I just did,

700
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:25,720
actually just finished
a course of antibiotics.

701
00:49:25,721 --> 00:49:29,830
I got a strange bug bite and southeast
Asia that sort of got infected in was

702
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,540
like Murcia.
Uh,

703
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:36,600
so I took a full course of antibiotics
and use a probiotic supplement that was

704
00:49:36,641 --> 00:49:41,641
similar to VSL number three and
had absolutely no issue with,

705
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:45,730
uh,
any kind of gut problems.

706
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:50,140
And typically the last time I use an
antibiotic was over 20 years ago and it

707
00:49:50,141 --> 00:49:52,940
completely destroyed my
gut. And this time, uh,

708
00:49:53,110 --> 00:49:57,640
I took a probiotic supplement
and had absolutely no problems.

709
00:49:57,641 --> 00:50:01,780
I don't know if I would have had
problems if I didn't take the supplement,

710
00:50:01,810 --> 00:50:06,190
but it helped.
And to a probiotic supplement,

711
00:50:06,191 --> 00:50:10,990
males would be good. I guess the lesson
I learned and when you travel to,

712
00:50:10,991 --> 00:50:15,991
when you move someone to a different
location and there for any sufficient

713
00:50:16,631 --> 00:50:20,290
amount of time, weeks, you, you're
changing their gut microbiome.

714
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:22,750
And I think that really
needs to be studied.

715
00:50:23,410 --> 00:50:28,370
And I think in general we
need to understand and we
need to understand if the

716
00:50:28,371 --> 00:50:31,550
ketogenic diet disrupts the microbiome.

717
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:34,930
And we have to understand
if things like travel, uh,

718
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:37,160
can disrupt the microbiome.

719
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:42,050
I imagine there's many things that
are disruptors of the gut microbiome.

720
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:45,260
And, uh, as we start to do research,

721
00:50:45,261 --> 00:50:49,410
I think these things will
be more clear and, uh,

722
00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:52,910
things that can optimize the microbiome.

723
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:56,630
And I think probably more importantly,
even for our servicemen,

724
00:50:57,050 --> 00:50:59,780
and I knew the Department of
Defense is interested in this.

725
00:50:59,781 --> 00:51:03,950
NASA judged in this obviously the
space environment, it's probably not,

726
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,400
uh,
or putting guys and you know,

727
00:51:07,730 --> 00:51:11,600
moving them continuously across the
globe is probably not the best way to

728
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:15,010
optimize the gut microbiome. But, uh,

729
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:17,720
there's also questions like
things like artificial sweeteners,

730
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:21,440
if we're drinking chlorinated water,
antibiotics in our food,

731
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:26,390
so many things to consider when we
consider the gut microbiome. So,

732
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:28,640
relating back,
I went off on a tangent,

733
00:51:28,641 --> 00:51:33,350
but when it comes to the key to
genic diet and the gut microbiome,

734
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:35,210
we still have a lot to learn,

735
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:40,500
but recommendations would be
to have a diverse diet, uh,

736
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:44,900
as much as possible.
And from my understanding,

737
00:51:44,901 --> 00:51:45,860
the bacteria,

738
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:51,480
there's going to be a bacterial shift
from carbohydrate thriving bacteria to

739
00:51:52,311 --> 00:51:56,750
bacterial species that
thrive off fat. So, and my,

740
00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:00,110
uh, from my understanding,
that's not a negative thing.

741
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:03,770
So the next question
comes from Mary to Kala,

742
00:52:03,771 --> 00:52:06,110
Adi and she asks,

743
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:10,070
currently she's currently on
the QT Jank Diet. However,

744
00:52:10,071 --> 00:52:13,940
she's confused,
should I count my calories?

745
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:18,680
I'm definitely restricting my
carbs and increasing my fat intake.

746
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:24,020
But keeping track of calories along with
meal planning seems overwhelming if I

747
00:52:24,021 --> 00:52:26,830
don't worry about calories a,

748
00:52:26,930 --> 00:52:31,340
will I gain weight on the
key to genic diet? So yes,

749
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:34,820
of course you will. So there's
that simple thermodynamics. If you,

750
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:38,540
if you're putting in more
calories into your body,

751
00:52:38,541 --> 00:52:43,490
then you're burning off those surplus
calories are going to end up, uh,

752
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:48,630
as stored body fat or manifests itself
and sort of metabolic derangement over

753
00:52:49,341 --> 00:52:53,810
time. A number of times, uh, when
people transition to a ketogenic diet,

754
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:56,390
they will,
you know,

755
00:52:56,391 --> 00:53:01,160
just kind of go crazy with some of the
ketogenetic diet foods that are sort of

756
00:53:01,161 --> 00:53:02,000
indulgent.

757
00:53:02,090 --> 00:53:07,090
And that would be things like
butter or sour cream or you know,

758
00:53:07,190 --> 00:53:12,190
I can sit down with a bag of macadamia
nuts or cashews and policy that off

759
00:53:12,261 --> 00:53:14,750
pretty quick. You know, that's
a thousand plus calories.

760
00:53:15,110 --> 00:53:17,450
And this is really important
to understand. The Keytruda,

761
00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:22,130
the energy density of the Ketogenic Diet
is about twice that of a normal diet.

762
00:53:22,610 --> 00:53:23,443
So the amount,

763
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:28,580
the volume of food that you're eating
is smaller and it may seem like you're

764
00:53:29,130 --> 00:53:29,611
restricting.

765
00:53:29,611 --> 00:53:33,840
So then the volume of food that's on your
plate will be much less than when you

766
00:53:33,841 --> 00:53:37,410
are not on a kid. Think Diet if
you're keeping it ISO cohort.

767
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:42,060
But chances are that
over time that you'll,

768
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:45,180
you'll inadvertently self
restrict on the kid genic diet.

769
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:50,400
So your blood glucose will be,
there's far less fluctuations.

770
00:53:50,401 --> 00:53:55,380
You won't have these big postprandial
excursions and your glucose that kickoff a

771
00:53:55,381 --> 00:53:59,550
surge of insulin that make you
hypoglycemic, you know, a few hours later,

772
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:00,541
uh,

773
00:54:00,541 --> 00:54:05,070
and make you kind of craving
another Bolus of food again.

774
00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:10,370
So that sort of whole cycle is eliminated
and that was really eliminated in me.

775
00:54:10,471 --> 00:54:15,471
Probably one of the most practical
advantages that I've been able to realize

776
00:54:16,501 --> 00:54:19,920
from the ketogenic diet is the,
the control of hunger.

777
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:25,130
And I think that has a huge carry over
effect when it comes to being able to

778
00:54:25,590 --> 00:54:29,250
have control of your food intake.

779
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:32,130
And not having your food
intake sort of control you.

780
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:37,050
So tracking is a very tedious process,
but after you do it,

781
00:54:37,051 --> 00:54:39,210
after a certain point,
you really don't have to.

782
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:44,440
I can look at a piece of meat or oil or,
uh,

783
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:48,390
some green vegetables on my plate and
just calculate the macros in my head

784
00:54:48,810 --> 00:54:49,231
really.

785
00:54:49,231 --> 00:54:52,980
And sometimes I'll just sort of wait it
out and do it in double checks and times

786
00:54:52,981 --> 00:54:54,620
to make sure I'm right.

787
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:58,710
But it's not a just nowadays it's
after you follow the ketogenic diet,

788
00:54:58,711 --> 00:55:00,120
it's not a laborious process.

789
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:03,750
A one trick I've learned
is that before dinner,

790
00:55:03,810 --> 00:55:06,060
which is my main meal of the day,

791
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:11,420
I'll have a bowl of soup and it kind
of soup that I have is usually broccoli

792
00:55:11,491 --> 00:55:16,320
cream soup or cream of mushroom soup.
And instead of using whole dairy cream,

793
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:21,300
I used concentrated coconut milk
in place of the dairy cream. So,

794
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:26,160
uh, and I thin it out so it's
not super dense in calories.

795
00:55:26,161 --> 00:55:27,390
But after eating that,

796
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:31,440
the amount of food that I want to
consume this like cut in half. Uh,

797
00:55:31,441 --> 00:55:35,820
obviously that, that's a lot of calories
too. But, uh, it's really super cute.

798
00:55:35,821 --> 00:55:39,090
Agentic so the next
question comes from Dominic.

799
00:55:39,150 --> 00:55:42,900
A bushman is his name and he asks,

800
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:49,280
how do you feel about the usual crappy
food served at scientific conferences?

801
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:54,510
And in parentheses, the smartest people
seem to have the worst lifestyle.

802
00:55:55,050 --> 00:55:58,770
And he asked,
what are my nutritional tricks?

803
00:55:58,770 --> 00:56:03,630
Just survive attending these
scientific conferences,

804
00:56:03,631 --> 00:56:08,631
which I'm about to jump on a plane now
and go to a scientific conference in

805
00:56:09,691 --> 00:56:14,400
Europe. And I know that the foods are
going to be very tempting over there.

806
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:16,920
Um,
in Budapest,

807
00:56:16,921 --> 00:56:21,720
actually a very good food over there.
Luckily it's pretty key to Quito friendly.

808
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:26,230
So I am not a purist when it comes
to really fallen occasioning die.

809
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:31,440
So if someone was to follow me around
when I'm traveling and looking at what I'm

810
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:33,880
getting off the menu,

811
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:39,120
they probably wouldn't think I'm falling
any kind of weird dietary patterns.

812
00:56:40,210 --> 00:56:41,021
Uh,
I,

813
00:56:41,021 --> 00:56:46,021
you can almost always get a salad and
you can almost always asked for extra

814
00:56:46,301 --> 00:56:49,270
butter, extra olive oil, uh,

815
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:54,380
to put on the chicken beef
or fish that it put on salad.

816
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:59,050
Um, but generally a limit
dairy protein when I'm home,

817
00:56:59,051 --> 00:57:03,370
but we'll indulge a little bit when I'm
traveling. Of course, cheeses, ketogenic.

818
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:08,410
Um, so my, my recommendations
for what I do, uh,

819
00:57:08,411 --> 00:57:13,411
as I've probably mentioned before is
that my bags are packed now and I have a

820
00:57:13,661 --> 00:57:18,661
case of sardines in a case of oysters
and they are packed in a extra virgin

821
00:57:19,781 --> 00:57:21,460
olive oil.
Um,

822
00:57:22,450 --> 00:57:27,450
and I also go to a store near me and
I buy bulk macadamia nuts and I think

823
00:57:28,870 --> 00:57:33,870
macadamia nuts are agree with me more
than almonds and other types of nuts.

824
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:36,430
Yeah.
The conferences that I attend,

825
00:57:36,431 --> 00:57:41,431
they actually do have an appreciation for
nutrition and they had fantastic array

826
00:57:42,221 --> 00:57:47,100
of food there. Other conferences, not
so much, but I think, you know, it's,

827
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,720
it's always people,
people say,

828
00:57:49,721 --> 00:57:52,510
I can't follow the ketogenic
diet because you know,

829
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:54,760
on the businessperson I'm
traveling all the time.

830
00:57:55,030 --> 00:57:58,960
It's just not possible for me to
follow this diet. So what should I do?

831
00:57:58,990 --> 00:58:00,970
I think it's actually easier.

832
00:58:00,971 --> 00:58:05,930
The ketogenic diet is far easier to follow
if you are that kind of person who's

833
00:58:05,950 --> 00:58:07,840
on the move all the time.

834
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:11,740
So that the food that you're
consuming as much more energy dense,

835
00:58:12,070 --> 00:58:16,600
it's less weight, it's less things
that you have to carry in your bag.

836
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:22,200
Sardines and oysters and macadamia nuts
take up a very small amount of weight,

837
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:26,170
relatively speaking, and they
have a really high energy density.

838
00:58:26,650 --> 00:58:29,290
So I can,
uh,

839
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:32,320
I tend not to like to take
a check bag when I travel.

840
00:58:32,321 --> 00:58:35,260
Just scientific conferences,
I can bring, uh,

841
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:39,670
just my carry on and get,
and if calculated this,

842
00:58:39,671 --> 00:58:43,420
I can get about 10,000 calories a,
you know,

843
00:58:43,421 --> 00:58:48,421
a food on my carry on really easily
and kept all my clothes for a week.

844
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:53,050
So I couldn't do that if I
wasn't on occasion and Diet. So.

845
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:58,480
So the next question
comes from Willie men,

846
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:02,500
do stimulants eight and Ketosis.

847
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:07,660
And are there any particular
stimulants that are good? Yeah,

848
00:59:07,661 --> 00:59:10,660
I think caffeine has a
ton of research behind it.

849
00:59:11,050 --> 00:59:15,940
The military is a big fan of caffeine
and the military has a really high bar in

850
00:59:15,941 --> 00:59:17,860
regards to,
uh,

851
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:22,280
in regards to their safety in regards
to their efficacy and their incorporated

852
00:59:22,281 --> 00:59:26,750
into different food products. Like,
uh, let me say the first trash,

853
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:31,090
if first strike ration is something,
you know,

854
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:34,940
that they make up their in Natick on
that feeding center there and it's

855
00:59:34,941 --> 00:59:38,180
basically just sugar and caffeine.
So I think they need to change that.

856
00:59:38,181 --> 00:59:43,181
But caffeine has long
been a staple in my diet,

857
00:59:43,791 --> 00:59:45,830
in the form of coffee.
Um,

858
00:59:46,490 --> 00:59:49,850
right now the sipping
on my coffee with MCT,

859
00:59:49,851 --> 00:59:52,120
the caffeine is just
starting to kick in and,

860
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:57,340
and I feel it and I feel good on caffeine
and I don't feel any negative effects

861
00:59:57,411 --> 00:59:58,244
from it.

862
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:03,280
Over 200 milligrams of caffeine
in me raises my blood sugar.

863
01:00:03,650 --> 01:00:07,640
A 100 milligrams seems
to be the sweet spot. Uh,

864
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:12,350
200 milligrams of caffeine will cause a,

865
01:00:12,740 --> 01:00:16,730
an overactivation of the sympathetic
nervous system maybe produce some anxiety

866
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,510
and it tends to caffeine mobilizes
free fatty acids from adipose,

867
01:00:20,511 --> 01:00:23,870
but it also kind of breaks
down glycogen from the liver.

868
01:00:24,170 --> 01:00:29,170
If my glucose is sitting at 70 70 and
I take 200 milligrams of caffeine,

869
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:33,860
I'll see a bump up to
75, maybe even 80, uh,

870
01:00:33,890 --> 01:00:35,720
with that amount of caffeine.

871
01:00:35,721 --> 01:00:40,660
But a hundred milligrams seems to
be a good sweet spot for me. Uh,

872
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:42,170
there's caffeine is an appetite.

873
01:00:42,171 --> 01:00:47,171
Suppression has antioxidant effects in
the form of coffee and have a couple of

874
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:52,760
papers on my desk. I started
reading about the, uh,

875
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:57,200
the effects of coffee on liver function
to an improvement in liver function.

876
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:01,340
So another stimulant that
I like to talk about,

877
01:01:01,370 --> 01:01:04,820
and that used a lot when I was younger,
uh,

878
01:01:04,910 --> 01:01:09,560
is a federal and ephedrin hydrochloride.
I don't know if it's so available. Uh,

879
01:01:09,590 --> 01:01:11,750
it's, it's, we use it in the lab.

880
01:01:11,751 --> 01:01:16,160
We did experiments on
pseudoephedrine and CNS,

881
01:01:16,161 --> 01:01:18,270
oxygen toxicity.
You know,

882
01:01:18,290 --> 01:01:22,670
divers will pop lots of sudafed before
they go diving because he went their

883
01:01:22,671 --> 01:01:27,560
sinuses to, to be clear. So they
can equalize, right. If you're not,

884
01:01:27,561 --> 01:01:28,700
if you can't equalize,

885
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:33,680
if you reserve a whole day to go diving
and you're stuffed up and you can't

886
01:01:33,681 --> 01:01:38,060
equalize, then you're, you're out of luck.
You know, you can't, you can't dye it.

887
01:01:38,140 --> 01:01:40,280
It's too painful and
can be really dangerous.

888
01:01:40,550 --> 01:01:44,790
So ephedrine is actually pretty big
in the diving community. I mean,

889
01:01:44,791 --> 01:01:49,050
I always took it before I went diving
that we did a study showing that ephedrine

890
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:53,010
can actually decrease latency to seizure,
uh,

891
01:01:53,030 --> 01:01:58,030
at a particular level of hyperbaric
oxygen that would stimulate the navy seal

892
01:01:59,271 --> 01:02:02,980
dive to say 130, two feet
of seawater. So you're,

893
01:02:02,981 --> 01:02:07,910
you're getting an overstimulation of the
brain, uh, with, with a federal and uh,

894
01:02:08,030 --> 01:02:11,870
so I think with, with a high
dose, so that's the thing.

895
01:02:11,871 --> 01:02:13,730
It's all relating to the dose.

896
01:02:13,731 --> 01:02:18,731
I think ephedrine is a great stimulant
that could aid ketosis and it can help

897
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:25,980
the release of fat from
adipose and enhanced Beta
oxidation of fat in the liver.

898
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:31,260
Personally, I've seen that a federation
can kick me into ketosis pretty fast.

899
01:02:31,261 --> 01:02:36,180
And ephedrine, caffeine stack, uh,
it can kick on a fib in some people.

900
01:02:36,690 --> 01:02:40,650
So especially at the dose gets high,
you know, 50 milligrams or more per day,

901
01:02:40,950 --> 01:02:44,600
but 25 milligram, those
to the federation, uh,

902
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:47,280
or less per day can elevate your mood,

903
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:52,530
can cause pretty significant
noticeable appetite suppression.

904
01:02:53,070 --> 01:02:54,150
And it's more of a,

905
01:02:54,350 --> 01:02:59,350
a psychological effect when it comes
to getting a physiological response.

906
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:02,160
50 milligrams,

907
01:03:02,161 --> 01:03:07,161
200 milligrams a day of ephedrine to
get a really measurable increase in fat

908
01:03:07,711 --> 01:03:12,150
oxidation rates.
And that would give me side effects.

909
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:16,920
So, and again, I don't, I don't even,
I'm not sure if the veteran is to legal,

910
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:20,130
so don't,
don't take this as a recommendation,

911
01:03:20,131 --> 01:03:24,810
but I think 25 milligrams
of ephedrine can, uh,

912
01:03:24,990 --> 01:03:29,990
improve your adherence to a nutritional
protocol just simply by suppressing your

913
01:03:30,391 --> 01:03:32,220
appetite and giving you more energy,

914
01:03:32,430 --> 01:03:34,690
which you're going to go
wanting to go workout,

915
01:03:34,910 --> 01:03:37,510
you're going to want to exercise longer.
Um,

916
01:03:38,130 --> 01:03:42,360
and I would strongly advise
against the use of amphetamines.

917
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:47,420
I don't see they're addictive
and generally people who
take these things just

918
01:03:48,091 --> 01:03:52,800
have a bad outcome. They get
addictive too, if not physiologically,

919
01:03:52,801 --> 01:03:56,910
psychologically. Uh,
Modafinil is something.

920
01:03:57,590 --> 01:04:01,530
Uh, I've kind of been
interested in testing and I've,

921
01:04:01,710 --> 01:04:05,640
but I've never taken it, but I've
talked to people who have taken it.

922
01:04:06,470 --> 01:04:07,080
Um,

923
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:11,670
I did get an email just yesterday actually
from a woman who's been on Modafinil

924
01:04:11,671 --> 01:04:14,010
for over 15 years continuously,

925
01:04:14,370 --> 01:04:17,100
and she was able to get
off of it. And, well,

926
01:04:17,101 --> 01:04:21,960
she had a narcolepsy I think, but
she was able to get off of it, uh,

927
01:04:21,990 --> 01:04:26,850
when she got into a state of
nutritional ketosis and, um,

928
01:04:27,330 --> 01:04:31,610
and wrote me a kind of a really nice
email along emails just saying that, uh,

929
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:34,270
like this basically the key Jank die.

930
01:04:34,271 --> 01:04:39,060
It kind of saved her from this
continuous abuse. She thought,

931
01:04:39,090 --> 01:04:43,810
you know, her use of Modafinil was sort
of more or less like an abuse of it for,

932
01:04:43,970 --> 01:04:44,970
for many years.

933
01:04:46,190 --> 01:04:50,490
So it's approved for military
use and before mission.

934
01:04:50,790 --> 01:04:55,790
And so in a state where sleep deprivation
is unavoidable and you need to

935
01:04:56,161 --> 01:04:58,290
maintain cognitive resilience,

936
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:01,350
the use of Modafinil can be a good idea.

937
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:06,270
Tim Actually asked me to,
uh, to address this question,

938
01:05:06,510 --> 01:05:10,440
can a vegetarian or Vegan
follow a Ketogenic Diet?

939
01:05:10,830 --> 01:05:13,020
You can look up.
Beth is you peck.

940
01:05:13,050 --> 01:05:18,050
Kenya is the lead dietician
for the Charlie Foundation
and it may not be posted

941
01:05:18,521 --> 01:05:19,271
on the website,

942
01:05:19,271 --> 01:05:23,560
but I know she works
directly with patients.

943
01:05:23,650 --> 01:05:24,340
Uh,

944
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:29,340
and customize is a vegetarian or even
Vegan ketogenic diet and many of her

945
01:05:29,561 --> 01:05:31,930
patients and uses,
uh,

946
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:36,340
to achieve ketosis shoes as
higher amounts of MCT oil.

947
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:40,750
So there's a couple websites too that I
noticed who did a quick search online,

948
01:05:41,050 --> 01:05:42,460
Kido motive,

949
01:05:42,490 --> 01:05:47,490
k e t o m o t ivy and Keto Diet App are
two websites that I find were really

950
01:05:51,581 --> 01:05:56,581
helpful in regards to listening to
foods and listing the type of different

951
01:05:56,621 --> 01:06:01,621
recipes that are vegetarian
or Vegan ketogenic diet
could be sort of adjusted to

952
01:06:05,650 --> 01:06:08,800
how do we help people that are
Vegan follicular Cenk Diet.

953
01:06:09,190 --> 01:06:12,760
And I think the solution,
the main problem would be the protein.

954
01:06:12,910 --> 01:06:17,910
It's just hard to put together foods
that have a compliment of essential amino

955
01:06:19,991 --> 01:06:20,650
acids.

956
01:06:20,650 --> 01:06:25,600
So you could just supplement
with essential amino acids
and that's one option.

957
01:06:25,860 --> 01:06:30,860
And the other option would be plant
based protein isolates that are hemp.

958
01:06:33,850 --> 01:06:38,110
You have,
you have rice protein isolate,

959
01:06:38,140 --> 01:06:41,290
you have a pea protein isolate.
No,

960
01:06:41,291 --> 01:06:44,770
10 years ago there was plant protein
but it had a lot of carbs in it.

961
01:06:44,771 --> 01:06:49,771
And nowadays you can get 30
grams of protein with like
one or two or maybe three

962
01:06:51,731 --> 01:06:56,700
grams of carbs.
And that completely fits in with uh,

963
01:06:57,190 --> 01:06:58,390
a Vegan ketogenic diet.

964
01:06:58,570 --> 01:07:03,570
So one of the products that kind of stood
out and it just looking at the reviews

965
01:07:04,661 --> 01:07:05,020
and,

966
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:10,020
and with the taste on the macro nutrient
profile would be a product called Mrm

967
01:07:11,530 --> 01:07:16,390
veggie elite protein powder.
And the chocolate Mocha is very good.

968
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:21,840
So if you take this a Mrm veggie elite
protein powder and mix it with coconut

969
01:07:22,451 --> 01:07:23,620
cream or what,

970
01:07:23,621 --> 01:07:28,621
what would be concentrated coconut milk
throw and a half of avocado or in some

971
01:07:28,781 --> 01:07:32,200
MCT oil,
the ca oil and do it.

972
01:07:32,201 --> 01:07:37,201
So the little mixture that I made up was
80% of the calories were from fat and

973
01:07:41,050 --> 01:07:45,110
25% of the calories were from protein.
So it just titrate.

974
01:07:45,140 --> 01:07:48,910
It is just like one scoop
of protein powder, I think.

975
01:07:48,970 --> 01:07:53,970
And a in 15% of the calories were from uh,

976
01:07:55,420 --> 01:07:59,170
carbohydrates and it was
really pretty much fiber,

977
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:01,000
a high fiber carbohydrates.

978
01:08:01,001 --> 01:08:04,600
So this gives a ratio
of two to one if we go.

979
01:08:04,601 --> 01:08:09,490
So two would be fat. And the one would
be a combination of carbs and protein.

980
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:14,700
So if we're kind of relating it back to
the classical Johns Hopkins ketogenic

981
01:08:16,101 --> 01:08:21,101
ratio ratios that they use
and it's 900 calories and,

982
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:26,690
and that was a really good kind of example
of a pure Vegan and I posted that on

983
01:08:26,691 --> 01:08:31,670
my Facebook yesterday. So yeah,
the Ketogenic Diet as possible,

984
01:08:32,030 --> 01:08:36,040
pretty easy for your vegetarian, a
little more difficult for Vegan. Uh,

985
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:41,080
I'm gonna work on this and maybe even
work with a colleague of mine to write a

986
01:08:41,811 --> 01:08:43,850
book that covered this subject.

987
01:08:43,851 --> 01:08:47,240
And if someone hasn't kind of
written book already, I see some,

988
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:49,250
some blogs on online,

989
01:08:49,251 --> 01:08:53,520
but not a whole lot of resources out
there for vegans that want to do with

990
01:08:53,521 --> 01:08:57,410
kitchen jank diet. So many
people. The next question,

991
01:08:57,980 --> 01:09:02,980
should I be concerned if the key to genic
die increases my LDL or Ldl particle

992
01:09:05,361 --> 01:09:09,890
number? Uh, I'm a little, little bit
concerned and I'm still learning about it.

993
01:09:10,190 --> 01:09:15,190
But if your LDL or Ldl p skyrockets and
stays elevated after several months,

994
01:09:18,370 --> 01:09:23,330
uh, you might want to be concerned
about it. So or just kind of be more,

995
01:09:24,070 --> 01:09:28,820
pay more attention to tracking
certain aspects of your,

996
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:34,490
your uh, your health, particularly your
inflammation in your blood lipid levels.

997
01:09:35,540 --> 01:09:40,540
So the number of LDL particles maybe
increase because you're also carrying more

998
01:09:40,701 --> 01:09:45,701
triglycerides before you get a lipid
profile test done and you start looking at

999
01:09:48,441 --> 01:09:52,280
these numbers, make sure that you're
rested, make sure you're not stressed,

1000
01:09:52,350 --> 01:09:55,730
make sure you don't have any kind of
infection, which will increase it.

1001
01:09:56,210 --> 01:09:57,670
So what I think seeing with the kids,

1002
01:09:57,680 --> 01:10:02,680
I think diet is that the LDL
will go up and about 50% of the,

1003
01:10:04,140 --> 01:10:04,610
the,

1004
01:10:04,610 --> 01:10:09,610
the people who follow a ketogenic diet
and especially at the calories are not

1005
01:10:10,041 --> 01:10:14,540
restricted. So if you're restricting
calories on a ketogenic diet,

1006
01:10:14,541 --> 01:10:19,541
which many people do that use the diet
to manage for the management of epilepsy

1007
01:10:20,121 --> 01:10:21,250
or cancer.
Uh,

1008
01:10:21,590 --> 01:10:25,430
even in that population with accused
bank Dai is sort of calorie restricted.

1009
01:10:25,490 --> 01:10:30,320
About 25% of them will
sort of email back and say,

1010
01:10:30,321 --> 01:10:32,900
well, my doctor is following
me and this is going up.

1011
01:10:32,930 --> 01:10:37,760
But a lot less if calories are
restricted, uh, see this phenomenon.

1012
01:10:38,330 --> 01:10:42,290
So I think it's important not to stressed
out about it and to kind of look at

1013
01:10:42,291 --> 01:10:43,124
the big picture.

1014
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:47,330
So the first book I had was
the book from Johns Hopkins,

1015
01:10:47,900 --> 01:10:48,470
uh,

1016
01:10:48,470 --> 01:10:53,150
that was written by John Freeman and
Erick Coats off and that described,

1017
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:54,230
you know,

1018
01:10:54,230 --> 01:10:58,700
the classical kind of a dairy
based four to one ratio,

1019
01:10:58,730 --> 01:11:00,960
classical ketogenic diet.
Uh,

1020
01:11:01,490 --> 01:11:05,760
and that kind of shifted my
numbers in interesting ways. My,

1021
01:11:05,780 --> 01:11:07,850
my LDL went up a suited,

1022
01:11:07,851 --> 01:11:12,851
my HDL doubled almost from like 50 to
almost a hundred after about four to six

1023
01:11:15,541 --> 01:11:20,070
months, I think. So
right now my HDLs 98 my,

1024
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:20,933
or right now I've,

1025
01:11:21,090 --> 01:11:26,090
I've transitioned into what I call a
supplemented modified Atkins or modified

1026
01:11:27,541 --> 01:11:32,541
ketogenic diet and supplemented because
they do take in c eight and I do take in

1027
01:11:33,331 --> 01:11:34,250
some exemptions,

1028
01:11:34,260 --> 01:11:37,170
ketones in the form of some of the
products that are on the market.

1029
01:11:37,590 --> 01:11:40,170
I'll talk about that a
little bit more. Uh, so I'm,

1030
01:11:40,350 --> 01:11:45,350
I'm using a supplemented
modified ketogenic diet
similar to the macronutrient

1031
01:11:46,291 --> 01:11:50,300
ratios that's described, you
know, on the, on the website, uh,

1032
01:11:50,420 --> 01:11:52,380
Billy foundation website
has a description,

1033
01:11:52,381 --> 01:11:54,390
a good description of the
modified ketogenic diet.

1034
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:57,360
My ratio is looking pretty good.

1035
01:11:57,361 --> 01:12:02,361
My total cholesterol to HDL ratio is like
2.4 right now for my last blood test.

1036
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:12,080
So my total cholesterol is
two 38 and my HDL is 98.

1037
01:12:13,530 --> 01:12:17,610
Triglycerides range from 40 to 70.

1038
01:12:17,650 --> 01:12:21,990
He's numbers are really similar to other
people that have emailed me that were

1039
01:12:21,991 --> 01:12:22,830
concerned.

1040
01:12:23,550 --> 01:12:28,020
And my inflammation
marker of inflammation,

1041
01:12:28,021 --> 01:12:30,450
CRP was really low.

1042
01:12:30,451 --> 01:12:33,100
I'm going to do a whole cytokine ask.

1043
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:37,350
Say when I was on a high carb diet,
my CRP was two,

1044
01:12:37,710 --> 01:12:41,790
2.4 a couple of times.
Now it's like 0.2.

1045
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:46,980
So literally in the last three
blood work, uh, that are looking,

1046
01:12:47,070 --> 01:12:51,570
looking at now, uh, it
ranged from 0.1 to 0.3.

1047
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:55,710
So when I was on a high carb diet,
it's literally 10 times higher,

1048
01:12:56,640 --> 01:13:00,000
rarely have gotten sick when
I'm on the Ketogenic Diet.

1049
01:13:00,001 --> 01:13:03,300
And I do think that it
helps with immune function.

1050
01:13:03,390 --> 01:13:05,910
And that's another area I
could talk about. You know,

1051
01:13:05,911 --> 01:13:10,860
we talk about the ketogenic diet being
kind of a panacea for everything.

1052
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:14,970
It cures the common cold. A,
uh, I have not had a cold,

1053
01:13:15,750 --> 01:13:16,321
probably,

1054
01:13:16,321 --> 01:13:21,321
maybe one cold in the last six years
and I used to routinely get a cold every

1055
01:13:24,210 --> 01:13:27,210
year at least once or twice a year.
So in the last five years,

1056
01:13:27,211 --> 01:13:31,110
I have one cold that I
could remember, but, uh,

1057
01:13:31,230 --> 01:13:35,820
infection I did get,
I traveled overseas,

1058
01:13:35,821 --> 01:13:40,821
I believe it was to hung bureaus and I
picked up some kind of stomach bug or

1059
01:13:40,891 --> 01:13:43,890
probably a virus, I think. And um,

1060
01:13:45,150 --> 01:13:48,540
and this really skyrocketed my LDL.

1061
01:13:48,780 --> 01:13:51,600
So we talked a little bit
about stress and infection,

1062
01:13:52,140 --> 01:13:56,320
sort of increasing that and that,
um,

1063
01:13:56,670 --> 01:13:59,760
it was really surprising. I mean,
it was like a, like off the charts.

1064
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:05,340
So it may have been sort of, you know,
something wrong with the test, but, um,

1065
01:14:06,060 --> 01:14:09,900
but I think something to consider
that when you do get these tests done,

1066
01:14:10,110 --> 01:14:13,710
you want to make sure your
body is truly at baseline. Uh,

1067
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:16,750
when you're looking at the
effects of the key to genic diet.

1068
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:19,120
So in general,

1069
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:24,121
I would not be concerned with an elevated
LDL unless it was in other biomarkers.

1070
01:14:27,170 --> 01:14:29,170
We're,
we're also out of whack.

1071
01:14:29,171 --> 01:14:33,550
So the things to look at would
be your triglycerides, your CRP,

1072
01:14:33,940 --> 01:14:38,200
and if your HDL goes down,
that's not a good thing.

1073
01:14:38,201 --> 01:14:41,410
I think thing that I kind of
focus on most is triglycerides.

1074
01:14:41,411 --> 01:14:42,910
If your triglycerides are elevated,

1075
01:14:43,180 --> 01:14:46,320
that means your body's just not adapting
to the ketogenic diet. You know,

1076
01:14:46,330 --> 01:14:49,600
some people's triglycerides are elevated
even with their calories are restricted

1077
01:14:50,260 --> 01:14:53,770
and that's a sign that, you know, you're
just the Yank die. It's not for you.

1078
01:14:54,130 --> 01:14:58,480
So you can't deny that and just,
it's not a one size fits all diet.

1079
01:14:58,540 --> 01:15:03,200
Do you find about a quarter to a
third of people just, you know,

1080
01:15:03,220 --> 01:15:07,840
have these abnormalities in their blood
work that would indicate they're not

1081
01:15:07,841 --> 01:15:12,160
adapting to the Diet? Maybe
they could give it more time,
but, um, it's some people,

1082
01:15:12,910 --> 01:15:13,181
you know,

1083
01:15:13,181 --> 01:15:17,770
I've given it three to four months
and still have elevated triglycerides.

1084
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:20,590
Pretty rare.
And you know,

1085
01:15:20,591 --> 01:15:24,490
most of the people that I talked to
kind of thrive on a ketogenic diet,

1086
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:28,780
but you do have many people who
just, you know, should not follow it.

1087
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:33,610
The next kind of branch of questions and
I'm going to address would be exogenous

1088
01:15:33,611 --> 01:15:34,444
ketones.

1089
01:15:34,540 --> 01:15:39,540
This is a question that popped up
recently and it comes from Carson row.

1090
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:43,840
Dozens of people have
asked me this question,

1091
01:15:44,020 --> 01:15:45,490
so I want to address it right up front.

1092
01:15:46,390 --> 01:15:51,270
So is it dangerous to use ketone
salts which are receiving WIC?

1093
01:15:51,700 --> 01:15:56,590
So there's, uh, the ketone salts
that are on the market. Now,

1094
01:15:56,591 --> 01:15:58,840
from my understanding,
uh,

1095
01:15:58,870 --> 01:16:01,960
have a d and an l configuration.

1096
01:16:02,620 --> 01:16:04,770
Dr. Richard Veech on,

1097
01:16:04,771 --> 01:16:08,770
he was a ketone expert on bulletproof
podcast and Dr Veech said that he would

1098
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:10,930
avoid ketone salts at all costs.

1099
01:16:11,140 --> 01:16:15,340
Something about real verse
mimicked molecules, et Cetera,

1100
01:16:16,030 --> 01:16:20,170
is dom and others like Patrick Arnold
have said, these are good and fine,

1101
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:25,420
uh, what gives, what's going
on? So, so Dr Veatch's,

1102
01:16:25,450 --> 01:16:25,991
uh,

1103
01:16:25,991 --> 01:16:30,991
I admire for like Dr Veech was kind of a
mentor to me getting into this area and

1104
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:35,320
I think it was back in 2008
I didn't even know that.

1105
01:16:35,890 --> 01:16:40,890
2008 and nine I didn't know that exogenous
ketones existed until I found some of

1106
01:16:42,341 --> 01:16:47,250
his patents and patents that
even predated his were from, um,

1107
01:16:47,530 --> 01:16:50,530
Dr Henri Brunon grabber at Case Western.

1108
01:16:50,620 --> 01:16:54,790
I think the first was like a Canadian
patent in the early nineties on a ketone

1109
01:16:54,791 --> 01:16:55,624
ester.

1110
01:16:56,050 --> 01:17:00,490
So Dr Veech has been sort of a mentor
to me in this process and making,

1111
01:17:00,491 --> 01:17:04,270
helping me understand sort of the
benefits of exotic gems, ketones.

1112
01:17:05,290 --> 01:17:10,190
So his comments on they've Asprey's
podcast and more recently been greenfield

1113
01:17:10,191 --> 01:17:15,191
pause podcast have created a lot of
confusion because his comments were not

1114
01:17:17,451 --> 01:17:19,820
scientific fact,
they were his opinion.

1115
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:23,510
And that's really important
to keep in mind. Uh,

1116
01:17:23,511 --> 01:17:27,830
also keep in mind that Dr Veech
has a lot of intellectual property,

1117
01:17:27,831 --> 01:17:29,330
sort of tied up in the,

1118
01:17:29,331 --> 01:17:34,220
are an antitumor of the ketone ester.

1119
01:17:34,580 --> 01:17:38,210
So more specifically the r one,

1120
01:17:38,211 --> 01:17:39,710
three butane dial,

1121
01:17:40,130 --> 01:17:44,870
our Beta hydroxybutyrate Mano
Esther would be like the means,

1122
01:17:45,170 --> 01:17:48,620
sort of like this single Esther
that he's focused on. Uh,

1123
01:17:48,650 --> 01:17:50,720
so the,

1124
01:17:51,050 --> 01:17:56,050
the appearance of these
ketone salts and the salt,

1125
01:17:57,140 --> 01:18:00,290
the Beta hydroxy butyrate is not,
you know,

1126
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:02,660
completely tied up with sodium.

1127
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:07,720
So it's actually balanced across four
different monovalent and divalent Ken

1128
01:18:09,230 --> 01:18:14,090
Ions, right? You have a sodium,
potassium, calcium and magnesium, um,

1129
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:19,480
that many of these products are using like
the key gen x product. And I think, uh,

1130
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:23,990
prove that product.
I'm not exactly sure what the blend is,

1131
01:18:24,020 --> 01:18:24,980
but uh,

1132
01:18:25,610 --> 01:18:30,610
but Dr Veech is kind of critical about
the sodium content and about the,

1133
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:32,180
the uh,

1134
01:18:32,540 --> 01:18:36,770
what he called the non-natural
isomer that was found in there.

1135
01:18:37,340 --> 01:18:41,180
It could, a new doctor beaches is
working very hard to commercialize.

1136
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:46,300
He's been working hard for a decade or
more to commercialize the mono ester of

1137
01:18:46,761 --> 01:18:48,770
the,
our Beta hydroxybutyrate.

1138
01:18:49,460 --> 01:18:52,490
So unrewarding grabber
who is features colleague,

1139
01:18:52,491 --> 01:18:53,900
they've actually published together,

1140
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:59,800
demonstrated the metabolism of [inaudible]
ketones and a number of elegant

1141
01:19:01,941 --> 01:19:05,540
studies. He actually used a,
these are tracer based studies,

1142
01:19:05,541 --> 01:19:10,280
were sort of labeled the carbons,
the ketones and could see where they go.

1143
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:13,810
And it was clear from
the science that the,

1144
01:19:14,570 --> 01:19:17,660
the s an antitumor just simply goes,

1145
01:19:17,661 --> 01:19:21,690
gets broken down to a cdot
Kobe and can even enter,

1146
01:19:21,691 --> 01:19:26,691
convert back to buy sort of further
elevating levels of Acetol coa that can

1147
01:19:29,871 --> 01:19:34,871
actually kind of feed back into
the biosynthesis of the our Beta

1148
01:19:35,061 --> 01:19:37,390
hydroxybutyrate.
And uh,

1149
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:42,370
there's a couple of Nice papers that
kind of show that. The first one, uh,

1150
01:19:42,380 --> 01:19:47,380
the one that I'm thinking about looked
at the r and the s one three butane dial

1151
01:19:48,890 --> 01:19:51,410
metabolism in the liver of rats.

1152
01:19:51,740 --> 01:19:54,050
There's no data to support.

1153
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:59,080
Dr Veech is claim that the ketone salts
that are on the market are dangerous or

1154
01:20:00,171 --> 01:20:03,160
ineffective and that would
include Quito sports.

1155
01:20:03,170 --> 01:20:06,910
Kido CAINA prove its product. Uh, k o,

1156
01:20:07,650 --> 01:20:08,221
uh,

1157
01:20:08,221 --> 01:20:13,221
you have the key gen x product is also
using the rear simic salt forever green

1158
01:20:14,371 --> 01:20:16,920
has product.
He tonics are key.

1159
01:20:16,921 --> 01:20:20,610
Topia so many emails,
dozens,

1160
01:20:20,611 --> 01:20:23,330
if not hundreds of emails I've
gotten from it, from this,

1161
01:20:23,331 --> 01:20:26,700
the people that were
concerned. Uh, and it's,

1162
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:28,650
it's kind of easy.

1163
01:20:28,651 --> 01:20:33,600
The doctor of each is a very esteemed
kind of researcher and I think he firmly

1164
01:20:33,601 --> 01:20:37,410
believes that the are an antitumor is um,

1165
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:42,000
sort of the way to go when it comes
to exogenous ketones. And I did too.

1166
01:20:42,001 --> 01:20:43,560
I think our lab,
actually,

1167
01:20:43,561 --> 01:20:48,561
the first ketone ester that we tested
for CNS oxygen toxicity was the one three

1168
01:20:50,371 --> 01:20:52,520
butane dial, uh, uh,

1169
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:55,920
Beta hydroxybutyrate mono
ester and the RN and tumor.

1170
01:20:55,921 --> 01:20:59,070
And it didn't prevent
oxygen toxicity seizures,

1171
01:20:59,370 --> 01:21:03,930
so elevated pretty much
exclusively Beta hydroxybutyrate.

1172
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:04,860
And um,

1173
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:10,460
I was going to give up on the project and
then I discovered an earlier patent by

1174
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:16,320
Henri burning grabber that had a one
three butane dial combined with a cdot

1175
01:21:16,321 --> 01:21:20,640
acetate. And that to me it made perfect
sense, right? Because when you consume it,

1176
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:23,670
the it hydrolyzes in your gut.

1177
01:21:23,671 --> 01:21:28,620
So you released to Acetoacetate and that's
one of the ketones at the body uses.

1178
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:31,510
And then the one three butane dial,
um,

1179
01:21:32,460 --> 01:21:36,060
goes to the liver and gets broken down
completely to Beta hydroxybutyrate.

1180
01:21:36,450 --> 01:21:38,220
And the pharmacokinetics are beautiful.

1181
01:21:38,221 --> 01:21:43,221
You get a kind of a one to one ratio of
Beta hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate

1182
01:21:43,711 --> 01:21:44,544
and the liver.

1183
01:21:44,790 --> 01:21:49,790
And it was in that particular ketone
Ester gave remarkable neuroprotection

1184
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:53,430
against CNS oxygen toxicity.

1185
01:21:53,730 --> 01:21:58,410
So that was like the second ketone Ester
that we tested a Patrick Arnold's help

1186
01:21:58,411 --> 01:21:59,570
me synthesize it.

1187
01:21:59,571 --> 01:22:04,500
And once we got the synthesis formula
and unrewarding grabber was very kind to

1188
01:22:04,501 --> 01:22:08,590
just give it to me in and tell us
how to do it too. And that was rare.

1189
01:22:08,591 --> 01:22:12,060
Simic so that was received
Mc one three butane dial,

1190
01:22:12,090 --> 01:22:16,530
which breaks down to the, the two
enantiomers of Beta hydroxybutyrate.

1191
01:22:17,190 --> 01:22:20,570
So it was remarkably
effective in our hands. So I,

1192
01:22:20,590 --> 01:22:25,210
I knew there was more to the story
than this. Um, I'm also, you know,

1193
01:22:25,230 --> 01:22:30,230
served with Dr Veech on various
workshops and can say that he's very,

1194
01:22:32,180 --> 01:22:36,900
uh, he's very opinionated when it comes
to the key to genic diet and he thinks to

1195
01:22:36,901 --> 01:22:41,901
diet is sort of a horrible diet
and the high fat is very dangerous.

1196
01:22:42,870 --> 01:22:47,460
And, uh, and we know that
that's not the case, you know,

1197
01:22:47,550 --> 01:22:52,550
and there's not a whole lot of
science to back up his claim.

1198
01:22:53,071 --> 01:22:58,071
But I think there's one paper in kids in
Johns Hopkins that followed the four to

1199
01:22:58,591 --> 01:23:01,170
one sort of classical key to genic diet.

1200
01:23:01,580 --> 01:23:04,950
And I think many of the kids were
put on a product called Keto cow,

1201
01:23:05,020 --> 01:23:08,920
which is like hydrogenated
vegetable oils and things like that.

1202
01:23:08,921 --> 01:23:13,310
And they had an elevated triglycerides.
Not very surprising. Right. Uh,

1203
01:23:13,750 --> 01:23:16,470
so I think when we talk about
the ketogenic diet, it's,

1204
01:23:17,110 --> 01:23:20,740
it's really important to acknowledge,

1205
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:25,660
and most people don't acknowledge this
in the medical community that the Diet,

1206
01:23:26,170 --> 01:23:29,200
there's many,
many versions of the Diet and we still,

1207
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:30,760
we have very little research.

1208
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:35,000
We still need to determine the
optimal key to genic diet, uh,

1209
01:23:35,020 --> 01:23:39,170
in regards to the fatty acid profile.
So we know we need it.

1210
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:43,990
A much greater omega three to Omega six
ratio is going to be really important.

1211
01:23:44,220 --> 01:23:48,640
The, the level of mono unsaturated
fats for saturated. Um,

1212
01:23:48,710 --> 01:23:52,820
I'll say that no scientist
when it relates to the,

1213
01:23:53,370 --> 01:23:54,430
the ketone salts,

1214
01:23:54,460 --> 01:23:59,460
no scientists are toxicologists that I'm
aware of would find to be just comments

1215
01:24:01,390 --> 01:24:03,260
to be true that the receive,

1216
01:24:03,290 --> 01:24:06,610
make salts are dangerous in any way,

1217
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:11,740
unless of course they're consumed
at really high amounts. As we know,

1218
01:24:11,830 --> 01:24:15,070
water is toxic in high amounts.
All things are dangerous.

1219
01:24:15,190 --> 01:24:19,630
Caffeine of course I talked about
a Tylenol, we'll quickly kill you.

1220
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:22,310
Uh, if you take too much of it. Um,

1221
01:24:22,810 --> 01:24:25,330
many studies actually show,

1222
01:24:25,570 --> 01:24:30,570
there's clinical studies that actually
show these receiving salts are very safe

1223
01:24:30,581 --> 01:24:31,361
in high doses,

1224
01:24:31,361 --> 01:24:36,361
even in kids given pure sodium Beta
hydroxybutyrate over periods of years.

1225
01:24:38,620 --> 01:24:43,620
And that actually leads me to the next
question that was asked by Emily bent and

1226
01:24:45,851 --> 01:24:50,851
she asked what's dawn's advice for fatty
acid oxidation disorders like mad or

1227
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:59,040
VLC add a medium chain are very long
chain Acetol coa dehydrogenase deficiency.

1228
01:25:00,970 --> 01:25:02,620
So mad,
uh,

1229
01:25:02,650 --> 01:25:07,650
is short for multiple esal
Kobe dehydrogenase deficiency.

1230
01:25:09,610 --> 01:25:13,840
And since being added
two new gorn screenings,

1231
01:25:13,841 --> 01:25:17,050
diagnosis have increased massively.

1232
01:25:17,590 --> 01:25:22,000
So there's a lot of kids,
more kids being diagnosed.

1233
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:27,120
So the complications of this particular
disorder can involve and acidosis the

1234
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:33,300
hypoglycemia. Other symptoms
such as general weakness, uh,

1235
01:25:33,340 --> 01:25:38,020
enlargement of the liver, enlargement
of the heart is really a problem.

1236
01:25:38,260 --> 01:25:40,510
So essentially what this disorder,

1237
01:25:40,570 --> 01:25:45,100
multiple ACL co a
dehydrogenase deficiency is,

1238
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:49,270
is a mitochondrial inefficiency.

1239
01:25:49,900 --> 01:25:54,900
And it's interesting if you just go
to pub med and type in mad m a d d and

1240
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:58,620
ketones,
you get a,

1241
01:25:58,630 --> 01:26:03,630
this is one just one of the disorders
that can be effectively treated with

1242
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:07,301
receipt.

1243
01:26:07,301 --> 01:26:12,301
Mick Beta hydroxybutyrate salts
and there's a number of studies.

1244
01:26:12,590 --> 01:26:16,400
Um, I'm just going to pub
med now. First study pops up,

1245
01:26:16,730 --> 01:26:21,730
highly efficient ketone body treatment
and multiple acyl coa dehydrogenase

1246
01:26:22,011 --> 01:26:26,840
deficiency related leukodystrophy.
So,

1247
01:26:26,841 --> 01:26:28,850
and that was published
in pediatric research.

1248
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:32,360
So that was using the ketone salts
essentially that are on the market,

1249
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:34,900
at least the sodium [inaudible],

1250
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:39,380
sodium Beta hydroxybutyrate assaults
and these kids, it's a nice description,

1251
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:42,480
a summary of that.
Uh,

1252
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:46,340
another study by a different investigator,

1253
01:26:46,370 --> 01:26:51,370
a favorable outcome after physiological
dose of Sodium d l three hydroxybutyrate

1254
01:26:54,230 --> 01:26:55,910
and severe Matt.

1255
01:26:56,950 --> 01:26:59,240
So sodium receive Mech,

1256
01:26:59,690 --> 01:27:02,360
Beta hydroxy butyrate was given.

1257
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:07,480
And this can be given in an oral dose or
it can be given ivy in very high doses

1258
01:27:08,450 --> 01:27:12,230
and no,
No side effects from this.

1259
01:27:12,590 --> 01:27:17,590
The dose that you need to get a miserable
boost in blood key tones is not giving

1260
01:27:19,011 --> 01:27:23,690
you a dangerous dose of sodium.
So that needs to be acknowledged.

1261
01:27:23,691 --> 01:27:28,100
And I think that was touched upon in
Dr Veech has sort of talk to that.

1262
01:27:28,130 --> 01:27:30,390
There's no way I think quote unquote,

1263
01:27:30,391 --> 01:27:35,391
he said there's no way that these ketone
salts could even increase ketones even

1264
01:27:36,050 --> 01:27:40,490
0.1 or 0.2 millimolar.
But that's not the case.

1265
01:27:40,491 --> 01:27:45,170
We know that we can get levels into
the one to $2 million range if you take

1266
01:27:45,171 --> 01:27:45,860
enough.

1267
01:27:45,860 --> 01:27:50,860
And I think as the technology sort of
evolves and we're creating various types

1268
01:27:52,551 --> 01:27:56,810
of Beta hydroxybutyrate salts from
monovalent and divalent con cannons in

1269
01:27:56,811 --> 01:28:01,811
addition to alkaline amino acids will
combine nicely with Beta hydroxybutyrate

1270
01:28:02,750 --> 01:28:03,950
and that's another avenue.

1271
01:28:03,980 --> 01:28:08,980
So you can kind of envision a blend
of Beta hydroxy buttery spread across,

1272
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:12,230
you know,
monovalent divalent,

1273
01:28:12,231 --> 01:28:16,960
cad ions and alkaline amino acids
like lysine and arginine history,

1274
01:28:16,990 --> 01:28:19,970
histamine, a stitch or
lean. These are all,

1275
01:28:20,030 --> 01:28:23,680
these are all combined pretty nicely
with the Beta hydroxy butyrate.

1276
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:29,240
So another study actually
comes from the Lancet shows DL,

1277
01:28:29,390 --> 01:28:31,330
three hydroxy butyrate.

1278
01:28:31,730 --> 01:28:35,900
So receive Beta hydroxybutyrate
treatment as a sodium salt,

1279
01:28:36,490 --> 01:28:40,790
uh, and treatment of multiple ACL
Kobe dehydrogenase deficiency.

1280
01:28:41,180 --> 01:28:46,180
So it's a really nice study
describing the use of uh,

1281
01:28:47,540 --> 01:28:51,560
this exogenous ketone and several
patients that have this disorder.

1282
01:28:52,010 --> 01:28:56,690
And it was really, um, highly
effective in treating that. So,

1283
01:28:57,200 --> 01:29:00,080
so in short,
the ketone salts,

1284
01:29:00,170 --> 01:29:04,440
there were simic Beta hydroxybutyrate
salts are not dangerous and they're

1285
01:29:04,441 --> 01:29:09,441
definitely not ineffective or research
needs to be done on all forms of

1286
01:29:11,100 --> 01:29:15,020
exogenous ketone salts and also,
uh,

1287
01:29:16,110 --> 01:29:17,550
exogenous ketone esters.

1288
01:29:19,320 --> 01:29:22,680
So a lot of work has already been done.
You know,

1289
01:29:22,681 --> 01:29:25,770
one could be more confident in,
you know,

1290
01:29:25,771 --> 01:29:30,510
the medical applications of this and
even potential performance applications

1291
01:29:30,511 --> 01:29:32,130
because when they're consumed,

1292
01:29:32,970 --> 01:29:37,140
the liver function and
kidney function is normal,

1293
01:29:37,141 --> 01:29:39,450
has been shown even
with really high doses.

1294
01:29:40,260 --> 01:29:43,650
So the next question is Jeff Urbane,

1295
01:29:44,370 --> 01:29:47,280
is he truly behind?
Involved in Ketogenics?

1296
01:29:47,790 --> 01:29:52,710
The website is kind of sketchy and the
product itself has a surprising number of

1297
01:29:52,711 --> 01:29:56,640
carbs, not sugars, carbs, but obviously,

1298
01:29:57,060 --> 01:29:58,350
uh,
but still,

1299
01:29:58,920 --> 01:30:02,130
so he's asking am I behind?

1300
01:30:02,550 --> 01:30:04,620
He genex are involved in key genex.

1301
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:10,100
The key genics formula or product on
the market uses the exonerees ketone

1302
01:30:12,151 --> 01:30:16,790
product is a great product. I use
it myself. I used it yesterday.

1303
01:30:16,791 --> 01:30:20,480
Sometimes I rotate, you know,
different things. If I'm testing a,

1304
01:30:20,490 --> 01:30:22,770
it uses a ketone formula,

1305
01:30:22,830 --> 01:30:27,830
a Beta hydroxybutyrate medium
chain triglyceride blend
that we sort of developed

1306
01:30:29,641 --> 01:30:31,980
and tested initially in the lab.
And we found,

1307
01:30:32,010 --> 01:30:37,010
we found that if you just take ketone
salts and at the time these were sort of

1308
01:30:38,101 --> 01:30:43,080
the liquid sodium potassium salts,
uh, founding Keto force, uh,

1309
01:30:43,081 --> 01:30:47,340
we weren't really able to get
an elevation of blood ketones.

1310
01:30:47,940 --> 01:30:49,320
That was really impressive.

1311
01:30:49,530 --> 01:30:53,880
And before we started getting some
GI discomfort and diarrhea, so,

1312
01:30:53,881 --> 01:30:54,660
uh,

1313
01:30:54,660 --> 01:30:59,190
we started tweaking and playing around
with different formulas and found that if

1314
01:30:59,191 --> 01:31:03,330
we took medium change triglycerides
and blended it together,

1315
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:07,190
we got a formula that
the fat essentially was,

1316
01:31:07,230 --> 01:31:10,140
was functioning like a
controlled delivery system.

1317
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:12,810
So instead of,
uh,

1318
01:31:13,260 --> 01:31:17,740
the rapid peak was a little less
rapid but kept going up peak,

1319
01:31:17,850 --> 01:31:22,850
they're around 60 to 90 minutes and then
extended out in additional hour or two

1320
01:31:24,511 --> 01:31:29,430
beyond just taking the ketone salts.
So when we blended it with MCT,

1321
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:33,600
it allowed if the sustainment
of blood ketones over time,

1322
01:31:33,660 --> 01:31:36,090
which is kind of the big thing.
And that's why, you know,

1323
01:31:36,091 --> 01:31:39,370
with the kids that were administered
a sodium Beta hydroxybutyrate,

1324
01:31:39,390 --> 01:31:42,220
they were given ivy formulas,
um,

1325
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:47,100
the Gi sometimes to tolerate it.
And when you bowl a sit in, eh,

1326
01:31:47,460 --> 01:31:51,720
the blood levels shoot up and quickly
come down fat and fiber and protein,

1327
01:31:51,740 --> 01:31:56,070
even fat as especially is a good
sort of controlled delivery system.

1328
01:31:56,071 --> 01:32:00,850
And there's ways to even package that
and formulate it to optimize that.

1329
01:32:01,290 --> 01:32:05,500
Uh, so the key gen x
product is not my product,

1330
01:32:05,770 --> 01:32:09,700
but they incorporate a patented
formula that we developed.

1331
01:32:10,180 --> 01:32:15,100
And, uh, I don't own the
patent. The university owns
the patents. So Keith genics,

1332
01:32:15,640 --> 01:32:20,140
as you know, his, his work with our
university to get the rights to,

1333
01:32:20,470 --> 01:32:25,060
so I used the product. Uh,
I don't endorse the product.

1334
01:32:25,210 --> 01:32:26,320
If I used,

1335
01:32:26,321 --> 01:32:31,321
I need to use 1.5 packets blood
into the one millimolar range.

1336
01:32:33,060 --> 01:32:35,170
Uh, when you take it,
you definitely feel it.

1337
01:32:35,170 --> 01:32:38,800
You don't want to take it after
like three or four in the afternoon,

1338
01:32:38,860 --> 01:32:41,170
but you take it early in the afternoon.

1339
01:32:41,171 --> 01:32:44,050
I'll probably take it
around lunchtime one or two.

1340
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:49,120
The energy focus you
feel is definitely real.

1341
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:53,710
I blood work, uh, when I've taken it
continuously to a fairly high dose,

1342
01:32:53,720 --> 01:32:58,480
looked really good markers of
inflammation, like almost nondetectable.

1343
01:32:58,810 --> 01:32:59,380
Uh,

1344
01:32:59,380 --> 01:33:04,380
my blood lipid profile is probably the
best it's ever been since I've been key

1345
01:33:04,871 --> 01:33:09,070
to genic. Uh, the carbs in
there, very minimal. You know,

1346
01:33:09,071 --> 01:33:14,071
what I look at is the glycemic response
to a dose and it's pretty much flat

1347
01:33:14,611 --> 01:33:15,640
lined in me.

1348
01:33:15,641 --> 01:33:20,260
So there's no vice simic response and a
nice elevation and Beta hydroxybutyrate.

1349
01:33:20,920 --> 01:33:24,900
Next question. Jimmy
Homan key. Genics Quito,

1350
01:33:24,910 --> 01:33:27,460
s Pruvit Keto cream.

1351
01:33:27,461 --> 01:33:31,750
Is he affiliated with
these, uh, like they claim,

1352
01:33:31,751 --> 01:33:34,360
if not,
does he recommend them?

1353
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:39,480
So I've tried all the exogenous ketone
products on the market and something I

1354
01:33:40,750 --> 01:33:44,350
like to do, uh, like to
figure out, you know,

1355
01:33:44,351 --> 01:33:48,220
what formulas are going to be optimal,
uh,

1356
01:33:48,250 --> 01:33:51,430
from the standpoint of using
these therapeutically too.

1357
01:33:51,430 --> 01:33:56,430
So I feel like I'm kind of at the
forefront of understanding what blends of

1358
01:33:57,881 --> 01:34:00,940
Ketone esters of ketone salts,

1359
01:34:01,330 --> 01:34:05,020
whether it be mineral salts and
amino acid salts and other things.

1360
01:34:05,650 --> 01:34:10,090
The Fun comes in for me is when you
start combining these things together and

1361
01:34:10,091 --> 01:34:14,470
that's what we're doing now and we're
doing mostly a lot of pharmacokinetics and

1362
01:34:14,471 --> 01:34:15,550
toxicology work.

1363
01:34:15,890 --> 01:34:20,710
They understand like what would
be the optimal formula of blend?

1364
01:34:20,740 --> 01:34:25,210
Like is it, you know, five
different types of salts with,

1365
01:34:25,870 --> 01:34:30,790
you know, to Esther's in a different
ratio. Like these are with some,

1366
01:34:30,820 --> 01:34:31,120
uh,

1367
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:36,120
c eight oil to sort of increased and
sustained blood ketones over time.

1368
01:34:36,281 --> 01:34:40,270
Like these are the questions that we're
asking and some of the things that we're

1369
01:34:40,271 --> 01:34:44,410
testing now, I think the Pruvit
product tastes really good.

1370
01:34:44,411 --> 01:34:49,411
It's smooth and creamy and it has a
higher concentration of sodium in much

1371
01:34:49,841 --> 01:34:52,390
higher. And maybe that's why it's
because kind of like the salty,

1372
01:34:52,391 --> 01:34:56,440
creamy taste I love. I kind
of ran out of it. I miss it.

1373
01:34:56,441 --> 01:34:59,930
I using it for a while
and they ran out. So, uh,

1374
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:02,930
right now I'm using
the key genics product,

1375
01:35:03,350 --> 01:35:08,350
which is really sort of pretty
powerful product as far as the uh,

1376
01:35:09,110 --> 01:35:11,030
effects that I feel from it.

1377
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:15,020
So the key genics product instead
of kind of a creamy taste,

1378
01:35:15,021 --> 01:35:19,470
it has more of a Tangy, bitter taste.
It's got some green tea extract.

1379
01:35:19,490 --> 01:35:23,090
So the caffeine, it does give you
a little bit of a caffeine boost,

1380
01:35:23,091 --> 01:35:26,720
maybe about 80 to a hundred
milligrams of caffeine.

1381
01:35:26,721 --> 01:35:28,610
And I think that's from
the green tea extract.

1382
01:35:29,010 --> 01:35:31,310
It might be some bitter orange in there.

1383
01:35:31,340 --> 01:35:36,320
There's a couple thermogenic
ingredients in there that uh,

1384
01:35:36,410 --> 01:35:39,650
you feel after you take the product
cause he feel a little bit warm for

1385
01:35:39,651 --> 01:35:43,880
evergreen, makes the, uh, key tonics
product. It tastes really good.

1386
01:35:44,270 --> 01:35:46,430
And I think it also gives a,

1387
01:35:46,490 --> 01:35:50,060
has caffeine in the form of green tea too.

1388
01:35:50,061 --> 01:35:52,530
It's pretty similar to the
key genics product. Uh,

1389
01:35:52,680 --> 01:35:55,930
just has a different taste
to keep in mind that the,

1390
01:35:56,630 --> 01:36:00,320
the early versions of these
products were like horrible.

1391
01:36:00,670 --> 01:36:04,940
This is going back. Uh, and I
used to blend them, actually.

1392
01:36:04,941 --> 01:36:06,410
I blended,
uh,

1393
01:36:06,470 --> 01:36:10,730
a mixture out and gave it
to my friend Peter Attia.

1394
01:36:10,910 --> 01:36:12,680
And Peter wrote a nice,

1395
01:36:12,830 --> 01:36:17,830
kind of a great summary of his
experience with using jet fuel.

1396
01:36:18,770 --> 01:36:19,281
Uh,

1397
01:36:19,281 --> 01:36:23,450
he's tested a lot of these things that
ketone esters in the ketone salts and did

1398
01:36:23,451 --> 01:36:28,130
the study on the bike where he looked
at oxygen consumption at a fixed power

1399
01:36:28,131 --> 01:36:28,964
output,

1400
01:36:28,990 --> 01:36:33,990
clamped it at 180 watts and then
look the oxygen consumption before,

1401
01:36:35,150 --> 01:36:39,740
uh, exogenous ketones. And after,
and at the time Peter was doing a,

1402
01:36:39,741 --> 01:36:42,380
a sort of a modified ketogenic approach.

1403
01:36:42,380 --> 01:36:46,820
So he was in a state of mild
nutritional Ketosis, like 0.6,

1404
01:36:46,821 --> 01:36:48,350
0.7,
and he would take,

1405
01:36:48,351 --> 01:36:53,351
he took the ketone salts and it shot
him up about one to two millimolar and,

1406
01:36:53,781 --> 01:36:54,560
uh,

1407
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:59,240
kind of dosed him up with a blend
that I knew would be approaching the,

1408
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:03,020
his Gi tolerability. And I think
he did okay. Didn't have any,

1409
01:37:03,390 --> 01:37:06,920
they didn't throw up or have diarrhea
from my understanding. And uh,

1410
01:37:07,190 --> 01:37:10,880
they really cranked it out on the bike
and showed that he was able to maintain

1411
01:37:10,970 --> 01:37:13,340
the same power output
and consume less oxygen,

1412
01:37:13,820 --> 01:37:18,020
like a five to 8% less oxygen,
which is tremendous.

1413
01:37:18,021 --> 01:37:20,180
We need to go and reproduce that study.

1414
01:37:21,200 --> 01:37:24,140
The next question comes
from Gavin Williams.

1415
01:37:25,310 --> 01:37:29,570
What are his goto
products, his MCT, powders,

1416
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:33,950
oils, ketone salts, anything
else? Uh, kind of covered this.

1417
01:37:34,220 --> 01:37:38,810
So I test whatever the company sent
me. I love to test things. I tend,

1418
01:37:38,811 --> 01:37:42,730
that's why I don't take a whole lot of
supplements because I like to keep a

1419
01:37:42,740 --> 01:37:45,770
unaltered, I guess you could say. So I can

1420
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:51,170
confidently test these things and,
and,

1421
01:37:51,680 --> 01:37:53,780
and if I'm measuring various blood,

1422
01:37:55,800 --> 01:37:58,830
whether it be comprehensive blood
work or blood glucose, ketones,

1423
01:37:58,831 --> 01:38:00,240
I know it's coming from that product.

1424
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:05,370
I really enjoy testing to prove that
product and uh, told you, you know,

1425
01:38:05,371 --> 01:38:08,100
I miss it now, that amount
of it. So they're listening.

1426
01:38:08,101 --> 01:38:12,540
They could send me some police. Uh, the
key gen x product is great. So I have a,

1427
01:38:12,570 --> 01:38:15,750
and that they've, I think they're on
like version two or three of that now.

1428
01:38:16,150 --> 01:38:20,130
The one of the first times I tried,
the last formula they gave me,

1429
01:38:20,131 --> 01:38:25,131
I took the product at like 7:00 PM and
kind of kept me up a little bit later

1430
01:38:25,141 --> 01:38:28,500
than I wanted to. Uh,
another product that's been,

1431
01:38:29,010 --> 01:38:33,570
that's really a goto product
and I, and I keep it, you know,

1432
01:38:33,690 --> 01:38:38,690
at my house at work and it's in my
suitcase when I travel is to quest MCT oil

1433
01:38:39,151 --> 01:38:44,151
powder and the quest coconut
powder is a big staple of mine.

1434
01:38:45,010 --> 01:38:45,420
Uh,

1435
01:38:45,420 --> 01:38:50,420
I've talked about sort of the foods that
I've consumed before the wild planet,

1436
01:38:51,211 --> 01:38:54,750
Sardines, sardines are uh, uh,

1437
01:38:54,900 --> 01:38:59,900
a much more sustainable then say like
tuna or some of the larger fish out there

1438
01:39:03,481 --> 01:39:06,670
that these predatory fish also,
uh,

1439
01:39:06,720 --> 01:39:11,670
through bioaccumulation can accumulate
toxins like mercury and other heavy

1440
01:39:11,671 --> 01:39:12,061
metals.

1441
01:39:12,061 --> 01:39:17,061
So I'm so non detectable levels of the
things that are of concern like mercury

1442
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:23,610
and other, other, uh, PCBs and
other things that are out there.

1443
01:39:24,630 --> 01:39:25,650
So that's important,

1444
01:39:25,950 --> 01:39:30,950
especially if you're giving your fish to
your young kids or the oysters are also

1445
01:39:31,590 --> 01:39:33,780
one of my goto food through the crown.

1446
01:39:33,781 --> 01:39:38,781
Prince Oysters are a really
good brand that I like.

1447
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:45,060
Lately there was a bone broth that I use.
It's a little pricey,

1448
01:39:45,061 --> 01:39:47,810
but the company kindly sent me a sample,

1449
01:39:47,830 --> 01:39:52,260
the test and it's called fire
and kettle bone broth. And uh,

1450
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:55,170
I use it maybe like twice a week.

1451
01:39:55,560 --> 01:39:59,100
I'll make soup out of it
and I think it's fantastic.

1452
01:39:59,101 --> 01:40:00,870
I think it's super high quality.

1453
01:40:01,410 --> 01:40:05,310
Another goto product would be a citation,

1454
01:40:05,880 --> 01:40:08,580
makes a product called extend perform,

1455
01:40:09,180 --> 01:40:12,690
which is branch chain amino acids,
leucine,

1456
01:40:12,691 --> 01:40:16,620
isoleucine and failing in a
two to one to one combination.

1457
01:40:17,010 --> 01:40:20,400
Lucien being the predominant, uh, uh,

1458
01:40:20,430 --> 01:40:24,510
branch chain amino acid
in the formula that, uh,

1459
01:40:24,511 --> 01:40:29,420
and we know that loose scenes, a
powerful activator of m tour, uh,

1460
01:40:29,430 --> 01:40:31,170
which is a good thing.

1461
01:40:31,171 --> 01:40:34,890
Activating and tore and skeletal
muscle is really important.

1462
01:40:35,370 --> 01:40:37,710
So intro workout.

1463
01:40:37,770 --> 01:40:41,430
So I used the product
preworkout and intro workout.

1464
01:40:41,820 --> 01:40:44,920
I've used the product a little
bit during fast and I think, uh,

1465
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:50,000
it could be an effective
tool for mitigating some
of the muscle loss that can

1466
01:40:51,481 --> 01:40:55,540
accompany a, uh, a longer short term fast,

1467
01:40:55,720 --> 01:40:58,930
if that makes sense.
So like five days or seven days.

1468
01:40:59,830 --> 01:41:04,830
So the extent performed product also has
a mushroom blend in it and I have to go

1469
01:41:05,741 --> 01:41:09,160
and look to see, uh, I actually
researched all the mushrooms,

1470
01:41:09,161 --> 01:41:13,390
but they're kind of
leaving me exactly which,

1471
01:41:13,420 --> 01:41:14,530
which blend it has in it.

1472
01:41:14,530 --> 01:41:19,530
But the mushroom blend that's in there
has been proven to have a pretty,

1473
01:41:20,050 --> 01:41:21,930
pretty impressive,
uh,

1474
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:26,140
data behind it as far as enhancing,
uh,

1475
01:41:26,260 --> 01:41:30,400
performance and for
lowering inflammation to,

1476
01:41:31,270 --> 01:41:31,751
uh,

1477
01:41:31,751 --> 01:41:36,550
the other supplements I take sort
of like staple things would be if,

1478
01:41:36,551 --> 01:41:40,540
uh, if I'm not getting
a lot of sun, a d three,

1479
01:41:41,230 --> 01:41:45,790
so 5,000, I use sort of, if
I'm not getting sun on days
and I'm outside all day,

1480
01:41:45,791 --> 01:41:50,500
I take, uh, 1000, uh, I
use, so don't, you don't,

1481
01:41:50,501 --> 01:41:51,940
you don't want to get too much d three.

1482
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:57,000
So there's a bell shaped curve and the
too much d three will give you the same

1483
01:41:57,821 --> 01:42:01,960
symptoms of a too little vitamin D.

1484
01:42:02,230 --> 01:42:07,210
So Melatonin is something that I take.

1485
01:42:07,240 --> 01:42:10,660
It's part of, uh, the
sleep cocktail I will take,

1486
01:42:10,661 --> 01:42:13,680
I use it when I cross time zones,
uh,

1487
01:42:13,930 --> 01:42:16,480
and I'll use up to 10 milligrams.

1488
01:42:16,900 --> 01:42:21,900
But for daily use I will use like
anywhere between one to three or five

1489
01:42:23,921 --> 01:42:27,380
milligrams, typically like three
milligrams I think is what I have. Um,

1490
01:42:27,730 --> 01:42:30,040
so I debit known is a,

1491
01:42:30,041 --> 01:42:33,070
another product that I take a,

1492
01:42:33,071 --> 01:42:36,350
I take it when,
uh,

1493
01:42:36,390 --> 01:42:40,870
I fly actually or before hard exercise.

1494
01:42:41,290 --> 01:42:42,250
It's the,

1495
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:46,560
I think of I Devin own is kind of
the drug version of coenzyme Q 10.

1496
01:42:46,570 --> 01:42:50,770
It's more absorbable,
it gets to the Mitochondria easier.

1497
01:42:50,771 --> 01:42:54,940
It's like a mitochondrial
antioxidant and it's also the, it's,

1498
01:42:55,750 --> 01:42:57,220
it's a germ rug.

1499
01:42:57,221 --> 01:43:00,940
It's almost considered a drug for the
management of something called Friedrich's

1500
01:43:00,941 --> 01:43:01,774
Ataxia.

1501
01:43:02,830 --> 01:43:06,580
And I think in kids that take I and
own it actually helps him out a lot.

1502
01:43:06,581 --> 01:43:11,170
I'm not sure if you know, Friedrich's
Ataxia is really a tough disorder,

1503
01:43:11,171 --> 01:43:16,060
but I know from what I knew
and just talking with, uh,

1504
01:43:16,360 --> 01:43:17,770
the far foundation,

1505
01:43:17,800 --> 01:43:22,800
so I know a family and a child
with Friedrich's Ataxia and uh,

1506
01:43:23,890 --> 01:43:25,980
from the research indicates that I Devin,

1507
01:43:25,981 --> 01:43:29,740
Oh and prevent cardiomyopathy
or a hypertrophy.

1508
01:43:30,250 --> 01:43:35,140
So it just showing it has a real effect.
So just enhancing cardiac function,

1509
01:43:35,620 --> 01:43:40,230
uh, has been, has been shown with I
Devin know. And so, um, I think it,

1510
01:43:40,330 --> 01:43:41,530
it's available.

1511
01:43:41,531 --> 01:43:45,400
It used to be kind of hard to find
because it was reclassified as a drug,

1512
01:43:45,790 --> 01:43:50,770
but I think it's, I know it's available
on smart powders.com you can find it,

1513
01:43:50,771 --> 01:43:53,790
which a lot of really
interesting things there.

1514
01:43:54,020 --> 01:43:58,280
A magnesium is a supplement I
take daily magnesium citrate,

1515
01:43:58,281 --> 01:44:00,740
magnesium chloride and
magnesium glycinate.

1516
01:44:00,741 --> 01:44:05,741
I tried them all and they all impacted
my blood magnesium levels in a good way.

1517
01:44:06,320 --> 01:44:09,320
So when I started the Ketogenic Diet,
I started getting cramps.

1518
01:44:09,590 --> 01:44:14,360
So one thing that popped out in my blood
work is that my magnesium was at the

1519
01:44:14,361 --> 01:44:15,590
low end of normal.

1520
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:20,750
And now that I'm supplementing now I'm
like a mid to high normal and I don't get

1521
01:44:20,780 --> 01:44:23,840
any cramps.
If I exercise more,

1522
01:44:23,960 --> 01:44:28,220
I definitely deplete my magnesium. So,
um, you know, if you're exercising,

1523
01:44:28,820 --> 01:44:33,260
just be sure that you're getting adequate
magnesium. Uh, on a QT Jank died.

1524
01:44:33,261 --> 01:44:37,860
I think you're, you're utilizing
more excluding more magnesium and a,

1525
01:44:37,861 --> 01:44:41,480
if my goat,
if I had one go to magnesium,

1526
01:44:41,481 --> 01:44:45,440
it would be this magnesium
citrate powder that I have.

1527
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:47,300
So I,

1528
01:44:47,480 --> 01:44:51,530
I've looked at things like
a Gabba a before sleep,

1529
01:44:51,531 --> 01:44:56,510
sometimes Finny Butte, which is
ventilated Gabba Gabba that has a,

1530
01:44:57,160 --> 01:45:00,890
a fennel ring attached to it and makes
it permeable to the blood brain barrier

1531
01:45:01,220 --> 01:45:05,050
and makes it more lipophyllic.
And when you take Finny Butte,

1532
01:45:05,090 --> 01:45:09,710
you feel it. I feel it. You feel much
more calm. You get, I get really deep,

1533
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:13,680
the most scary dreams when
I take take fenny Butte. Uh,

1534
01:45:14,140 --> 01:45:16,190
it has a pretty good calming effect.

1535
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:20,660
So I will use Finny Butte maybe
two or three times a month if that,

1536
01:45:21,350 --> 01:45:23,690
you tend to use it.
When I'm travel across time zones,

1537
01:45:23,691 --> 01:45:28,280
I'll take a finny Butte melatonin
stack before I get to bed.

1538
01:45:28,820 --> 01:45:32,060
Next question. Leo. Fouls
on our exotic us ketones.

1539
01:45:32,061 --> 01:45:37,061
I kido Kina only useful in a state of
ketosis or would they benefit someone who

1540
01:45:39,681 --> 01:45:42,410
is not keto adapted,
put differently?

1541
01:45:42,440 --> 01:45:46,550
Can ketones enter the TCA cycle?

1542
01:45:46,580 --> 01:45:51,580
I'll sit in as the Kreb cycle when
glucose is still available to the cell or

1543
01:45:51,621 --> 01:45:56,621
will the body preferentially use glucose
nullifying the effect of the ketones.

1544
01:45:57,230 --> 01:46:02,230
So ketones can be readily
transported into tissues as fuel.

1545
01:46:03,380 --> 01:46:08,380
If glucose is low or high and I think
the body will sort of use what's

1546
01:46:09,831 --> 01:46:12,170
available.
So if the glucose is low,

1547
01:46:12,171 --> 01:46:16,670
it'll use a greater proportion
of ketones for energy.

1548
01:46:16,671 --> 01:46:17,510
And it's also,

1549
01:46:17,810 --> 01:46:22,810
there's some tissue specificity in
regards to the mono carboxylic acid

1550
01:46:23,661 --> 01:46:26,990
transporter and there's transporters one,
two,

1551
01:46:26,991 --> 01:46:31,991
three and four and these have sort
of a different tissue distributions.

1552
01:46:33,620 --> 01:46:38,620
Breen is pretty high and MCT two
and three I believe the liver,

1553
01:46:40,070 --> 01:46:42,150
you know,
doesn't use good liver.

1554
01:46:42,190 --> 01:46:47,190
The ketone producer but doesn't use
ketones for fuel and skeletal muscles kind

1555
01:46:47,301 --> 01:46:48,350
of like in between.

1556
01:46:48,980 --> 01:46:53,980
So Sunday at eight indicates that
there may be enhance glucose uptake and

1557
01:46:54,211 --> 01:46:57,210
utilization in the presence of ketones.

1558
01:46:57,810 --> 01:46:59,580
And I know Dr Veech and,

1559
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:03,630
and others believe that ketones
influence influence sensitivity.

1560
01:47:04,200 --> 01:47:06,990
And it does it through
a number of mechanisms.

1561
01:47:07,410 --> 01:47:09,360
And I think through,

1562
01:47:10,260 --> 01:47:14,850
through altering redox chemistry,
it can do two things.

1563
01:47:14,851 --> 01:47:19,851
It can enhance the sensitivity of the
insulin receptor to the likened insulin.

1564
01:47:22,020 --> 01:47:27,020
And it can also cause a sort
of a translocation of the
receptor to the membrane.

1565
01:47:29,820 --> 01:47:33,750
And so there's more sort of
receptors that are available.

1566
01:47:34,440 --> 01:47:36,150
And I think,
you know,

1567
01:47:36,151 --> 01:47:39,480
I was a little has into
believe some of that,

1568
01:47:39,481 --> 01:47:44,481
but our new data we recently
published shows that as ketones go up,

1569
01:47:44,970 --> 01:47:49,970
and this is giving a bolus of exogenous
ketones to an animal that to eating a

1570
01:47:50,011 --> 01:47:54,660
high carbohydrate standard rat Chow,
glucose goes down.

1571
01:47:55,230 --> 01:47:57,900
And you know,
we don't know why that's happening,

1572
01:47:57,901 --> 01:48:01,920
but that could be part of the effect
could be enhanced with Pcos disposal

1573
01:48:02,070 --> 01:48:05,410
through enhancement of
insulin sensitivity and um,

1574
01:48:06,060 --> 01:48:08,790
and other things that we
don't fully understand.

1575
01:48:09,120 --> 01:48:13,020
And I think some of the data that we'll
be collecting that may shed light on

1576
01:48:13,021 --> 01:48:18,021
this is looking at the metabolomic
global metabolomic profile of the liver,

1577
01:48:19,230 --> 01:48:19,711
you know,

1578
01:48:19,711 --> 01:48:24,090
within without exogenous ketones and
how that's influencing liver metabolism.

1579
01:48:24,930 --> 01:48:29,930
So an alternative explanation could be
a decrease in hepatic gluconeogenesis.

1580
01:48:32,370 --> 01:48:36,810
So I think it's, it may be Bamyan number
of things kind of working together.

1581
01:48:38,130 --> 01:48:41,850
So Adam Rock Horst has a question,

1582
01:48:41,851 --> 01:48:45,690
can exogenous ketones
combined with a low carb diet,

1583
01:48:46,530 --> 01:48:49,460
uh, in parentheses, but
not a ketogenic diet,

1584
01:48:49,470 --> 01:48:54,120
still give some or all the benefits
of a strict ketogenic diet.

1585
01:48:54,990 --> 01:48:58,290
The experiments that we
run with exogenous ketones,

1586
01:48:58,320 --> 01:49:03,320
most of them excluding the one cancer
experiment when we combined the key to

1587
01:49:03,491 --> 01:49:06,630
genic diet with ketone ester.

1588
01:49:06,990 --> 01:49:11,990
So our experiments are typically run
using exogenous ketones given to animals

1589
01:49:12,690 --> 01:49:15,990
eating a standard high carb rodent child.

1590
01:49:16,380 --> 01:49:21,380
So I would say yes to this and I would
say yes because our first experiment

1591
01:49:24,180 --> 01:49:29,180
originally what I wanted to do was give
ketone esters for one week and dive rats

1592
01:49:30,841 --> 01:49:34,860
down to five atmospheres of oxygen,
which is 132 feet of seawater.

1593
01:49:35,100 --> 01:49:39,090
And we know that they have a seizure in
about 10 minutes and then look at that

1594
01:49:39,091 --> 01:49:40,710
latency to seizure.
You know,

1595
01:49:40,860 --> 01:49:45,860
after talking with a number of experts
and Dr Veech too thought the ketones

1596
01:49:46,380 --> 01:49:47,213
work,

1597
01:49:47,800 --> 01:49:51,880
but a number of the experts are convincing
me that you needed to be keto adapted

1598
01:49:51,910 --> 01:49:56,110
to get the benefits of exhaustion
is ketones that the ticket,

1599
01:49:56,111 --> 01:49:58,660
the optimal benefits, I'll say, you know,

1600
01:49:58,661 --> 01:50:02,850
and I thought they were right cause we
actually try doctor beaches, Esther, uh,

1601
01:50:03,040 --> 01:50:04,150
or version of the Ester,

1602
01:50:04,151 --> 01:50:09,151
the Mono Ester of Beta hydroxybutyrate
and it didn't prevent oxygen toxicity

1603
01:50:09,581 --> 01:50:10,270
seizures.

1604
01:50:10,270 --> 01:50:14,650
So I was more inclined to
believe at least an acute post.

1605
01:50:14,740 --> 01:50:18,670
I was more inclined to believe that
you needed continuous kind of longterm

1606
01:50:19,120 --> 01:50:21,370
dosing to get the brain to switch over.

1607
01:50:21,730 --> 01:50:25,960
But then we tried the a
one three butane dial,

1608
01:50:25,961 --> 01:50:27,970
a cdot acetate diaster,

1609
01:50:28,090 --> 01:50:32,650
which rapidly elevated Beta
hydroxybutyrate and a COO acid hay.

1610
01:50:33,100 --> 01:50:34,900
And that a single dose,

1611
01:50:34,901 --> 01:50:39,901
30 minutes prior to a five atmosphere
dive gave like 600% neuro protection or

1612
01:50:44,381 --> 01:50:48,790
delay the latency to seizure from
10 minutes to like over an hour,

1613
01:50:49,240 --> 01:50:54,240
which was pretty much more effective
than any anticonvulsant drug like ever

1614
01:50:54,281 --> 01:50:55,720
tested.
So,

1615
01:50:55,750 --> 01:51:00,460
and that was just simply feeding an
animal that's eating a high carb diet,

1616
01:51:01,210 --> 01:51:01,990
feeding him,

1617
01:51:01,990 --> 01:51:06,990
titrating in the dosage just enough
to elevate blood ketones to a level of

1618
01:51:08,171 --> 01:51:12,730
ketosis on par with a
person fasting for one week.

1619
01:51:13,120 --> 01:51:15,730
So you had fasting level,

1620
01:51:15,970 --> 01:51:19,210
prolonged fasting level
ketosis in 30 minutes.

1621
01:51:19,660 --> 01:51:22,390
And unlike drugs where you
get like a variety of effects,

1622
01:51:22,391 --> 01:51:24,940
like it worked in this
animal that not the animal,

1623
01:51:25,120 --> 01:51:29,470
like every single animal we tested when
we saw this remarkable neuro protection

1624
01:51:29,830 --> 01:51:33,280
with the ketone esters. So, so that was,

1625
01:51:33,281 --> 01:51:37,630
it was not my original hypothesis that it
would work this way, but it, but it did.

1626
01:51:37,750 --> 01:51:42,730
I guess Dr Veech was right. Uh, not right
about the Esther. I think we needed,

1627
01:51:43,300 --> 01:51:45,210
we needed not only Beta hydroxybutyrate,

1628
01:51:45,220 --> 01:51:50,050
we needed to see to acetate and his
particular Esther did not elevate that.

1629
01:51:50,051 --> 01:51:53,410
I think Beta hydroxybutyrate
elevating that would for his,

1630
01:51:53,411 --> 01:51:55,270
he's looking at um,

1631
01:51:55,390 --> 01:52:00,370
exercise performance and cognitive
benefits too. And I think it would work,

1632
01:52:00,490 --> 01:52:00,731
you know,

1633
01:52:00,731 --> 01:52:05,170
Beta hydroxybutyrate alone would
probably work remarkably well for that.

1634
01:52:06,130 --> 01:52:11,130
But when it comes to mitigating oxygen
toxicity seizures and also other

1635
01:52:11,351 --> 01:52:14,320
seizures, the animal models, it's,

1636
01:52:14,321 --> 01:52:19,321
it's very clear that you need to have
an elevation of a COO acetate and that

1637
01:52:20,111 --> 01:52:24,550
spontaneously decarboxylates to ask the
town and we know that can open potassium

1638
01:52:24,551 --> 01:52:29,200
channels in hyperpolarize the resting
membrane potential and mitigate some of

1639
01:52:29,201 --> 01:52:33,670
the glutamate excited toxicity
that's thought to be involved in,

1640
01:52:34,090 --> 01:52:37,270
in seizure genesis.
So,

1641
01:52:37,300 --> 01:52:40,510
and you don't get that we just
Beta hydroxybutyrate ester.

1642
01:52:40,930 --> 01:52:43,840
So answer your question.
Yeah,

1643
01:52:43,841 --> 01:52:48,280
I think you can get ketones.
I went off on a tangent and you,

1644
01:52:48,310 --> 01:52:53,240
she really talking about combining
exogenous ketones to a low carb diet.

1645
01:52:53,270 --> 01:52:56,810
Can you get the benefits?
Uh, absolutely. I think,

1646
01:52:56,840 --> 01:53:00,680
I think you can do that even
on a moderate carb diet.

1647
01:53:00,681 --> 01:53:02,000
It can probably get the benefits,

1648
01:53:02,001 --> 01:53:07,001
but there are so many benefits to a low
carb diet and of itself that we know

1649
01:53:08,381 --> 01:53:13,020
about. I think it just makes sense to
use it with some kind of carbohydrate

1650
01:53:13,021 --> 01:53:17,530
restriction. It is really important
and if you look at our cancer study,

1651
01:53:17,560 --> 01:53:22,560
we did the Ketogenic Diet and hyperbaric
oxygen and that had a remarkable effect

1652
01:53:22,750 --> 01:53:27,750
at prolonging survival and a
model advanced metastatic cancer.

1653
01:53:28,770 --> 01:53:29,800
And uh,

1654
01:53:30,270 --> 01:53:35,270
and when we combine the Ketogenic Diet
with hyperbaric oxygen and we combine to

1655
01:53:36,411 --> 01:53:37,980
ketone supplementation,

1656
01:53:38,180 --> 01:53:43,180
we had a really significant increase in
survival and suppression of tumor growth

1657
01:53:47,900 --> 01:53:50,210
and also medistatus.

1658
01:53:53,530 --> 01:53:56,950
Hey guys, this is Tim again. Just a
few more things before you take off.

1659
01:53:57,250 --> 01:53:59,950
Number one,
this is five bullet Friday.

1660
01:54:00,220 --> 01:54:03,190
Do you want to get a short email from me?

1661
01:54:03,191 --> 01:54:05,830
Would you enjoy getting a short
email from me every Friday?

1662
01:54:06,070 --> 01:54:10,330
That provides a little more soul of
fun before the weekend and five bullet

1663
01:54:10,331 --> 01:54:14,950
Friday is a very short email where I share
the coolest things I've found or that

1664
01:54:14,951 --> 01:54:16,570
I've been pondering over the week.

1665
01:54:16,750 --> 01:54:19,510
That could include favorite new
albums that I've discovered.

1666
01:54:19,511 --> 01:54:22,990
It could include Gizmos and gadgets
and all sorts of weird shit that I've

1667
01:54:22,991 --> 01:54:27,310
somehow dug up in the uh,
the world of the esoteric as I do.

1668
01:54:27,580 --> 01:54:32,580
It could include favorite articles that
I've read and that I've shared with my

1669
01:54:33,250 --> 01:54:35,980
close friends for instance,
and it's very short.

1670
01:54:36,040 --> 01:54:41,020
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness
before you head off for the weekend.

1671
01:54:41,080 --> 01:54:43,270
So if you want to receive that,
check it out.

1672
01:54:43,510 --> 01:54:48,190
Just go to a four hour work week.com
that's four hour workweek.com all spelled

1673
01:54:48,191 --> 01:54:52,330
out and just drop in your email and you'll
get the very next one and if you sign

1674
01:54:52,331 --> 01:54:56,950
up, I hope you enjoy it. This episode
is brought to you by four sigmatic.

1675
01:54:57,010 --> 01:55:01,720
I reached out to these
Finnish entrepreneurs after
a very talented acrobat,

1676
01:55:01,750 --> 01:55:03,700
introduced me to one of their products,

1677
01:55:04,120 --> 01:55:09,120
which blew my mind and the best
way possible it is mushroom coffee.

1678
01:55:09,580 --> 01:55:13,210
What on earth is this? Well,
it includes Chaga mushroom,

1679
01:55:13,480 --> 01:55:16,330
very powerful antioxidant,
considered a super food.

1680
01:55:16,331 --> 01:55:18,850
I was introduced to
Chaga by Laird Hamilton,

1681
01:55:19,180 --> 01:55:22,810
the King of Big Wave Surfing of all things
and it includes another mushroom that

1682
01:55:22,811 --> 01:55:24,250
is considered a no tropic,

1683
01:55:24,251 --> 01:55:28,240
a smart drug and this is lion's
mane in the entire packet.

1684
01:55:28,241 --> 01:55:30,520
You just add it to hot water,
tastes like coffee.

1685
01:55:31,150 --> 01:55:34,060
There is only 40 milligrams of caffeine,

1686
01:55:34,061 --> 01:55:37,620
so less than half what you would
find in a cup of coffee. So you,

1687
01:55:37,690 --> 01:55:38,980
I do not get any jitters.

1688
01:55:38,981 --> 01:55:43,981
I did not get any acid reflux or any type
of stomach burn and it put me on fire

1689
01:55:45,421 --> 01:55:48,990
for an entire day and I
only had half of the packet.

1690
01:55:48,991 --> 01:55:51,150
So this stuff is really amazing.

1691
01:55:51,510 --> 01:55:54,780
People are always asking me what I use
for cognitive enhancement right now.

1692
01:55:55,170 --> 01:55:59,370
This is the answer. So it is legal.
It will not give you visuals.

1693
01:55:59,580 --> 01:56:03,990
That's something else and you can try it

obsessed with at the moment and I don't

for men's gymnastics.

1702
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:44,430
I'm not easily impressed and I've
just been completely blown away by the

01:56:44,431 --> 01:56:47,790
sophistication of his programming
and the elegance of his programming.

1704
01:56:47,791 --> 01:56:52,350
I've been using gymnastic bodies for
just a few months now and I feel more

1705
01:56:52,351 --> 01:56:55,950
flexible, stronger, and
younger than I have in years,

1706
01:56:55,951 --> 01:56:59,250
and it sounds cheesy to hear
myself say that, but it's true.

1707
01:56:59,251 --> 01:57:02,220
That's the hardest part to
