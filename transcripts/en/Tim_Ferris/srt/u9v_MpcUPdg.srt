1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,880
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02,881 --> 00:00:07,040
I can run flat out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking. No else.

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:08,020
You posting a question?

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,380
I'm a cybernetic organism
living this year.

5
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,270
This episode is brought to you by Peloton,

6
00:00:26,271 --> 00:00:27,920
which I've been using
probably for about a year now.

7
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:32,150
Peloton is a cutting edge indoor cycling
bike that brings live studio classes

8
00:00:32,151 --> 00:00:35,300
right into your home. You can also
do on demand, which is what I do.

9
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:39,050
We'll come back to that so you don't have
to worry about fitting classes into a

10
00:00:39,051 --> 00:00:43,040
busy schedule or making it to a studio
or gym with a hectic or unpredictable

11
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:44,630
commute. I, for instance,

12
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:48,830
have a Peloton bike right in my master
bedroom at home and it's one of the first

13
00:00:48,831 --> 00:00:52,520
things I do. Many mornings I
wake up and meditate for a bit.

14
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:57,080
Then I knock out a short 20 minute ride
in my undies. Hard to do that at the gym,

15
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,840
take a shower and I'm in higher
gear for the rest of the day.

16
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:03,020
It's really convenient and has become
something that I look forward to.

17
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:05,810
So you have a lot of options
for one if you'd like,

18
00:01:05,811 --> 00:01:09,290
you can ride live with thousands of
other writers across the country on an

19
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:11,360
interactive leaderboard
to keep him motivated.

20
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,700
There are also up to 14 new classes added
everyday with more than 8,000 classes

21
00:01:16,881 --> 00:01:21,860
on demand and you can pick
based on length, 45 minutes,
20 minutes, whatever music,

22
00:01:21,861 --> 00:01:26,150
hip hop, rock and roll or say low impact
versus high intensity or interval.

23
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:31,310
You can pick the class structure and
style that works for you and in my case I

24
00:01:31,311 --> 00:01:35,600
quite like Matt Wilbur's and I tend to
do on demand and listened to a lot of and

25
00:01:35,601 --> 00:01:37,790
watch many of the same
classes over and over,

26
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,670
but I'm kind of promiscuous and also
enjoy classes from a lot of the other

27
00:01:40,671 --> 00:01:41,504
instructors.

28
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:45,800
They have Peloton and amazing roster of
incredible instructors in New York City

29
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:49,160
with a whole range of styles
and personalities so you
can find what you're in

30
00:01:49,161 --> 00:01:49,994
the mood for.

31
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:53,960
You also get real time metrics that you
can use to track your performance over

32
00:01:53,961 --> 00:01:58,820
time and that will help, I would say
catalyze you to beat your personal best.

33
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:01,880
Now that all sounds good, right?
Gamification, Yada, Yada, Yada.

34
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:06,140
I didn't think that it would work
for me or in any way incentivize me,

35
00:02:06,141 --> 00:02:09,680
but they really 100% hit the
nail on the head. I was very,

36
00:02:09,681 --> 00:02:14,681
very impressed with how motivating it
was and it worked tremendously to keep me

37
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:19,640
pushing a, which quite honestly takes
a fair amount. I can get quite lazy,

38
00:02:19,641 --> 00:02:22,250
particularly with anything
that edges on endurance,

39
00:02:22,251 --> 00:02:26,540
which is kind of more than five reps
of anything for me. So check it out.

40
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,830

This episode is brought to you by audible,

48
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,890
which has the largest selection
of audio books on the planet.

49
00:03:05,891 --> 00:03:09,700
I've used audible for many years and I've
several audio books to recommend right

50
00:03:09,701 --> 00:03:13,450
off the bat. If you're looking for a new
one ready player, one by Ernest Cline,

51
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:16,150
you may have heard of it.
The Tao of Seneca by Seneca.

52
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:20,080
If you want to hear my favorite collection
of letters of all time as well as the

53
00:03:20,081 --> 00:03:21,850
graveyard book by Neil Gaiman,

54
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:26,880
which is a fiction book I
use to reintroduce nonfiction
purists to the beauty

55
00:03:28,421 --> 00:03:31,720
and truth and enjoyment,
affection, the graveyard book.

56
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:35,020
It is incredible and I like the
version that Neil reads himself,

57
00:03:35,021 --> 00:03:38,290
but the entire ensemble cast is also fun.

58
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:42,910
Audible members get a credit every month,
good for any audio book in the store,

59
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:46,150
regardless of price and unused
credits roll over to the next month.

60
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,330
So if he didn't like your audio book,
no problem. You can exchange it,

61
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,410
no questions asked. Plus, your books
are yours to keep with audible.

62
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:57,190
You can go back and relisten anytime,
even if you cancel your membership.

63
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:01,720
And for some books, again, graveyard book
by Neil Gaiman, I've listened to many,

64
00:04:01,721 --> 00:04:04,780
many times. She may even just start over
as soon as you finish it the first time.

65
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:08,560
Audible also helps you to listen to more
books by letting you switch seamlessly

66
00:04:08,561 --> 00:04:11,260
between devices.
Picking up exactly where you left off,

67
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,420
whether it's on your phone,
through your car,

68
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:16,420
from a tablet or at home on
an Amazon Echo, whatever.

69
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,190
You can get through tons of books,

70
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,530
hands and eyes free while
doing almost anything.

71
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,750
So that is part of the beauty of audio.

72
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,750
It is a secondary activity when
you're walking the dog cooking,

73
00:04:25,751 --> 00:04:26,584
whatever it might be.

74
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:29,950
Audible content includes an
unmatched selection of audiobooks,

75
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,500

magazine and newspaper publishers
and business information providers.

78
00:04:39,701 --> 00:04:41,740
Maybe that's what I am,
a business information provider.

79
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:46,330

Hello boys and girls.

86
00:05:10,701 --> 00:05:14,000
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another
episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

87
00:05:14,001 --> 00:05:16,910
it is my job to deconstruct
world class performers,

88
00:05:16,911 --> 00:05:20,870
people who are the best at what they do,
to tease out the routines,

89
00:05:20,871 --> 00:05:23,300
the life lessons, the
habits, the favorite books,

90
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:28,280
whatever it might be that you can
hopefully apply and test in your own life.

91
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:32,390
My guest today is Paul Stamets.
Hundreds,

92
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:36,320
maybe thousands of people have
requested that I have Paul on the show.

93
00:05:36,321 --> 00:05:40,250
You can find them on Instagram,
Facebook and youtube. Paul Stamets, s.

94
00:05:40,251 --> 00:05:45,040
T. A. M. E. T. S. He is an intellectual
and industry leader in the habitat,

95
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,930
medicinal use and production of fungi.

96
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:51,020
That's if you end GI fungi.
Some people say,

97
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:54,440
and you might also think
of mycelium or mushrooms,

98
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:58,520
part of his mission is to deepen our
understanding of and respect for the

99
00:05:58,521 --> 00:06:03,200
organisms that literally exist under
every footstep taken on this path of life.

100
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:06,620
This episode is bonkers.
Uh,

101
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:10,220
the implications,
applications,

102
00:06:10,221 --> 00:06:15,221
medicinal uses of many of the things that
he'll discuss are truly mind boggling.

103
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:21,500
And we do get into some of my favorite
subjects, including psychedelics and,

104
00:06:21,501 --> 00:06:24,740
uh,
other aspects of bending reality.

105
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,880
Here we go back to the bio.
Paul is the author of six books,

106
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,710
including my psyllium running subtitle,

107
00:06:30,711 --> 00:06:35,090
how mushrooms can help save the world
growing gourmet and medicinal mushrooms

108
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:37,610
and siliciden mushrooms of the world.

109
00:06:37,611 --> 00:06:41,360
He has discovered and named numerous
new species of psilocybin mushrooms,

110
00:06:41,361 --> 00:06:45,540
psilocybin mushrooms, or a
solution be mushrooms, uh,

111
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,760
better known as magic mushrooms and
is the founder and owner of fungi,

112
00:06:49,761 --> 00:06:53,750
perfectee, makers of the host
defense mushroom supplement line.

113
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:58,670
And a little known fact. I have
been using host defense, uh,

114
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:03,700
products for a few years now after some
mean no Surat said that one of them was

115
00:07:04,461 --> 00:07:08,870
her favorite purchase of less than a
hundred dollars in the last year or two.

116
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,850
And that was in my last book,
tribe of mentors.

117
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:13,220
So I do have some familiarity
with his products.

118
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:18,670
Paul has received numerous awards
including invention ambassador for the

119
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:20,210
American Association for
the Advancement of Science,

120
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:25,160
the national mycologist award from the
North American Mycological Association

121
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:29,720
and the Gordon and Tino Wasson award
from the Mycological Society of America.

122
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,140
His Instagram is awesome if you
want to see some really, really,

123
00:07:33,141 --> 00:07:37,310
really weird fungi and him off in the
woods all over the world doing weird

124
00:07:37,311 --> 00:07:40,970
things.
And in a very new and breaking news,

125
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,840
we were actually holding the
podcast waiting for this to happen.

126
00:07:44,841 --> 00:07:48,920
Paul is the author of a new study
in nature, scientific reports,

127
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:54,280
which details how mushroom extracts
specifically extracts from woodland a poly

128
00:07:54,501 --> 00:07:54,741
pore.

129
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:59,150
Mushrooms can greatly reduce viruses
that contribute to bee colony collapse.

130
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,460
This is a huge, huge, huge deal.

131
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:06,760
And we do get into the importance
of bees and how without bees,

132
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:11,900
pretty much everything goes down the
toilet I including a lot of humanity.

133
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,030
So I will include a
link in the show notes,

134
00:08:14,031 --> 00:08:18,380
which you can always find
at tim.blog/podcast for

136
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:24,700
And two other announcements if you are
interested as I am and I'm certainly

137
00:08:25,491 --> 00:08:27,110
committed to this,

138
00:08:27,111 --> 00:08:32,111
to the tune of seven figures over the
next year or two to supporting psychedelic

139
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:35,420
science and research. Uh, please join me.

140
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:39,440
And if you're interested in doing
so at a higher dollar amount,

00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,510

146
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:01,820
There's a lot of amazing stuff on the
horizon that I hope you will be involved

147
00:09:02,101 --> 00:09:04,590
with.
And the last but not least,

148
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:09,650
the blog now contains transcripts
of every podcast episode.

149
00:09:09,931 --> 00:09:12,330
To date. People have been asking
for this for a long, long time.

150
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:13,230
I wanted to do it right.

151
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:18,530
So now you can find transcripts to
every episode of the podcast at Tim Dot.

152
00:09:18,751 --> 00:09:21,120
Blog, forward slash, transcripts,

153
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:25,200
and that is a long intro.
So without further ado,

154
00:09:25,201 --> 00:09:29,220
please enjoy this wide ranging
conversation with Paul Stamets.

155
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,710
And if you can only listen to one part,

156
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:36,030
jump ahead about 49 minutes or so.

157
00:09:36,031 --> 00:09:38,730
49 minutes and 50 seconds I believe.
But yeah,

158
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:43,820
let's call it 49 minutes to listen to
his description of his first experience

159
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:48,720
with solicit the mushrooms or psilocybin
containing mushrooms and the effect it

160
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:52,380
had on his lifelong stutter.
It is fucking nuts.

161
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,540
So if you're going to skip around,

162
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:58,950
jumped ahead 49 minutes or so and
listen to that story. It is really,

163
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,570
really wild. So they have it. Enjoy.

164
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:09,670
Paul, welcome to the show. Thank
you, Tim. I'm honored to be here.

165
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,660
I've had so many listeners
requests you on the show.

166
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:16,360
I have wanted to have you on
the show for so many years.

167
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:21,420
And finally when you made your very
comprehensive cameo and Michael Pollan's

168
00:10:23,441 --> 00:10:27,160
most recent book that served as the
reminder that I had to reach out somehow.

169
00:10:27,161 --> 00:10:31,270
So I'm very pleased that you're here
and I thought we could start with some

170
00:10:31,271 --> 00:10:34,350
definitions and pronunciation, which, uh,

171
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:39,360
are very selfishly points of
insecurity for me. So F, U, N, G, I,

172
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:40,720
how should we pronounce that?

173
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:43,250
Well, that's an excellent question. Um,

174
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:47,880
fungi according to Oxford English
dictionary with a j is the correct

175
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:52,560
pronunciation but fun,
fun, fun guy or fungi.

176
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,140
So fungi is,
what else am my colleges use?

177
00:10:55,650 --> 00:11:00,650
A though people Spanish mycologists
we'll use one g Italian mycologists we'll

178
00:11:01,321 --> 00:11:04,320
say phone g. Uh, but uh, English speakers.

179
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:07,320
The standard pronunciation
is fungi with a J.

180
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,190
Fungi.

181
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:13,190
And then there are two terms that I
suspect may not be totally synonymous.

182
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:17,940
We have mushrooms and
mycelium or Mycelium,

183
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:22,260
I don't know the correct pronunciation.
Are Mushrooms a subset of mycelium?

184
00:11:22,261 --> 00:11:26,970
One component part. Can you define or
distinguish those two for us please?

185
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:31,640
The mycelium is the underground network
analogous to the roots of a tree, uh,

186
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:33,740
and the fruit bodies,
the mushrooms.

187
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:38,770
So they are produced as a reproductive
structures long after many challenges on

188
00:11:39,621 --> 00:11:43,960
the path of growth, uh, in the wood
and woods underground, et cetera.

189
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:45,800
The mycelial networks are vast.

190
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,860
It's been called the
proverbial tip of the iceberg.

191
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:52,540
But just think of this
as the, the mycelium, um,

192
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:55,720
navigates through microbially
hostile environment.

193
00:11:55,930 --> 00:12:00,930
Literally there can be tens of millions
of microbes per gram of soil and the

194
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:05,860
mycelial, these five find filaments
that look like cobwebs, um, are,

195
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,020
are running underground.

196
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:12,250
And this underground network is being
challenged by all sorts of microbes.

197
00:12:12,251 --> 00:12:15,820
And as many people know that
bacteria like to eat fungi.

198
00:12:15,821 --> 00:12:17,680
That's why mushrooms rot.
Um,

199
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:21,670
but the fungi are able to navigate with
these mycelial networks only one cell

200
00:12:21,671 --> 00:12:25,630
wall thick and there can be up to
eight miles of mycelium per cubic inch.

201
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,950
And now they only have one cell wall
between uh, their, their internal,

202
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,180
uh,
cells and the external environment.

203
00:12:34,181 --> 00:12:36,700
We have five or six skin layers
that protect us from infection.

204
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:42,060
The mycelium that basically has one cell
layer and yet is able to overcome the

205
00:12:42,641 --> 00:12:46,510
challenges of millions of microbes,
many of which want to consume it.

206
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:50,890
And it navigates to create the largest
organism on this planet is a Mycelial Mat

207
00:12:50,891 --> 00:12:54,340
and eastern Oregon over
2100 acres in size.

208
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:59,200
Now it's one cell wall thick, and yet
it's the largest organism on this planet.

209
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:04,360
And that's the testimonial
to the immunological power
of the mycelium and this

210
00:13:04,361 --> 00:13:09,220
vast underground network, uh, that
is so essential to habitat and human.

211
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:12,880
And plant health is something
that we have really tapped into.

212
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,980
So mushrooms come from mycelium.

213
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:19,480
The mycelium can grow literally for
decades before a single mushroom farms.

214
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,400
Mushrooms are highly perishable.

215
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:25,840
They're like fish and four or five days
they mature and, and then they rot.

216
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,770
And then in doing so,

217
00:13:26,771 --> 00:13:31,150
they spoilery late just before they rot
and they attract insects that are then

218
00:13:31,151 --> 00:13:35,560
help spread the spores. Much like,
you know, birds spread seeds,

219
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:40,060
um, and the birds come to
fruit. The fruit of the tree,

220
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:41,770
like a peach for instance,

221
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:46,800
attracts insects and birds and then the
peach pit or seeds of an apple or what

222
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:53,470
other fruit are spread. So the fragments
of the mushrooms are beacons, fragrance,

223
00:13:53,471 --> 00:13:57,040
beacons, the MNA through the
ecosystem and the scent trails.

224
00:13:57,041 --> 00:14:02,041
And entice animals to come to these
bodacious Lee delicious fruit bodies.

225
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:06,250
And then they presented in the
course of them eating them.

226
00:14:06,251 --> 00:14:10,930
They spread the spores. But the
mycelium literally can be existent,

227
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,930
not, not invisible, invisible to us,

228
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:18,790
ridiculously stupid humans that are
thundering giants upon these networks that

229
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:19,750
are underneath their feet.

230
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:25,120
But the mycelium really racist behind
us and we're the biggest walking

231
00:14:25,121 --> 00:14:28,730
catastrophe that I know in the planet.
And as we walk, we break wood chips,

232
00:14:28,731 --> 00:14:33,220
we leave impressions or the Mycelium is
sensitive to those impressions of our

233
00:14:33,221 --> 00:14:34,054
footsteps.

234
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:38,740
And as we create new debris fields and
mycelium reaches up behind our footsteps

235
00:14:38,741 --> 00:14:42,700
to gobble up that newly made
material and competition,

236
00:14:42,701 --> 00:14:47,701
but other fungi and other
organisms and Mycelium,

237
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:52,400
if we're looking at mycelium and uh,
as one

238
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,510
component of that or rather not the,
the product of that I suppose.

239
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,430
And please feel free to
correct me if I am fine.

240
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:01,580
Screw things up by restating mushrooms.

241
00:15:01,581 --> 00:15:05,090
People have had a decent amount of
exposure to and they tend to associate it

242
00:15:05,091 --> 00:15:07,370
with, say, the produce
aisle in a grocery store.

243
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:10,810
And think of them perhaps as plants,
uh,

244
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,750
from a genetic perspective or
an evolutionary perspective,

245
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:17,990
how should people think about mycelium?

246
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:25,010
I love this question. Well, you
bring up a very good point for,

247
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:26,850
for almost a hundred years now,

248
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:30,120
the mycology departments where
a subset of botany departments,

249
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:33,510
they really should be in the
zoo. All logy departments. Uh,

250
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,600
we separated from fungi about 650 million
years ago is 650 million years ago we

251
00:15:39,661 --> 00:15:41,400
had a common ancestor.
In fact,

252
00:15:41,401 --> 00:15:46,230
there's a new super kingdom called a
pilot content that joins fungi and animals

253
00:15:46,231 --> 00:15:50,860
Aaliyah together when basically
the my fiddle network,

254
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:55,770
um, when, uh, when they hit
the land from the ocean,

255
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:00,240
many people don't realize some of the
largest networks of mycelium in the world.

256
00:16:00,241 --> 00:16:02,360
Now I've been discovered,
uh,

257
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:06,690
in below the sediment layers of the ocean
is vast myself on networks throughout

258
00:16:06,691 --> 00:16:10,770
the entire ocean. There's lots
of dead organic plant material.

259
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,160
This falling down to the sediments and
the mycelium is involved in gobbling

260
00:16:14,161 --> 00:16:18,990
those up. But from an evolutionary
point of view, I 650 million years ago,

261
00:16:18,991 --> 00:16:22,870
we chose the path of in circulating our
nutrients, basically in a cellular sac,

262
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:23,763
stomach,

263
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:28,970
the mycelium digest nutrients externally
if it is the enzymes and acids and

264
00:16:29,161 --> 00:16:34,161
other compounds that breakdown complex
organic molecules and then absorbs those,

265
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,790
uh, through the cell walls.
The entire mycelial network,

266
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:43,350
um, is like a sponge.
It absorbs selectively.

267
00:16:43,351 --> 00:16:46,740
There's nutrients that
it needs and animals, uh,

268
00:16:46,741 --> 00:16:51,741
went sort of overground and we did
all these digestive systems and I in a

269
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,970
protective, uh, skin, uh,
enveloped structure or bodies.

270
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:00,330
Uh, and then the mycelium
continued on us of course,

271
00:17:00,331 --> 00:17:02,040
very happily developing underground.

272
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:07,340
So with the divergence of fungi and
animals is extremely well documented.

273
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:12,330
But an ordinary article came
out just this past year.

274
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:16,290
Um, and this article, you know, the, the,

275
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:20,580
the big bang was about
13.8 billion years ago.

276
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:25,200
The earth formed around
4.5 billion years ago.

277
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:28,900
Uh, the first unicellular organisms, uh,

278
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,620
were found them a few
hundred million years later,

279
00:17:31,621 --> 00:17:36,621
but the first multicellular organisms so
far found the oldest one is 2.4 billion

280
00:17:37,531 --> 00:17:41,030
years ago, but has found
that South African lava, uh,

281
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:45,330
in the basalt and as
2.4 billion years old,

282
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,360
the oldest representation so far
in the fossil record of a organism,

283
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:53,040
and these are a mycelial networks.

284
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:58,140
So the mycelium had its form
long before we've had ours.

285
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:01,920
And moreover in Brazil,
150,

286
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:05,630
115 million years ago,
this is before the,

287
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:10,440
the great extinction event that
killed off the dinosaurs. Um,

288
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,130
and at that time machines
also had their forms.

289
00:18:14,131 --> 00:18:16,470
So these mushrooms are
really ancient organisms.

290
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:19,920
They had developed reforms long
before we had developed ours.

291
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,160
We are descendant from
these fungal networks. Um,

292
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,540
they are progenitor ancestors.
We are,

293
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:31,200
we are really descendants of fungi.
This is why under the microscope,

294
00:18:31,201 --> 00:18:34,350
so many of our cells,
it looks so similar to that of a fungi.

295
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:38,610
And also why our best antibiotics that
we have coming from fungi are very good

296
00:18:38,611 --> 00:18:41,340
at preventing bacteria from growing.
But we have very,

297
00:18:41,341 --> 00:18:45,810
very few good antifungal antibiotics
because of our close evolutionary history

298
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:48,210
that are not toxic or highly toxic to us.

299
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:51,640
So antifungal drugs are
extremely dangerous. Um,

300
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:56,040
those who've had immunosuppressants
are well aware of this. Um, and um,

301
00:18:56,130 --> 00:19:00,450
when you defeat the immune system and
the human body using Immuno suppressants

302
00:19:00,451 --> 00:19:04,740
for a organ transplants
and other, uh, reasons and,

303
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,080
and medicine you really,
um,

304
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:13,080
dancing with death because it's extremely
damaging to your immune system that

305
00:19:14,431 --> 00:19:16,320
can hold many of these infections at bay.

306
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:18,980
There's so many directions
that I want to go with this.

307
00:19:18,981 --> 00:19:20,710
I'm going to try to contain my,
uh,

308
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:26,680
add and focus this in a direction towards
another type of utility and relates to

309
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:34,460
a problem that if I were to walk 15 feet,

310
00:19:34,461 --> 00:19:38,150
I could observe with my own eyes
right now. And that is carpenter ants.

311
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:43,450
And I was wondering if you could talk
about your history with carpenter ants and

312
00:19:45,771 --> 00:19:49,580
the intersection with mycelium.

313
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:56,580
Um, is a subject very dear
to my heart. So, well let me,

314
00:19:56,581 --> 00:19:58,760
I'm gonna I'm gonna Segue,
um,

315
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:02,280
because there could be listeners out
there who have children and I'm going to

316
00:20:02,281 --> 00:20:06,840
tell their children to the story how
vacuuming and helping your mother and your

317
00:20:06,841 --> 00:20:09,390
parents made me over a million dollars.

318
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:15,200
And it ties in the carpenter ants. So,
um, I grew up in, so I'm gonna, I'm,

319
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:19,500
I need two minutes to set
this up in the world. Okay.

320
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:24,990
So I grew up in a small town
in Ohio, Columbiana, Ohio,
a very conservative town,

321
00:20:24,991 --> 00:20:27,590
about 5,000 people.
Um,

322
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,090
and I grew up in a
fairly wealthy household.

323
00:20:30,091 --> 00:20:34,530
My family had steel mills and
saw mills and we were affluent.

324
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:35,400
Um,

325
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:40,400
we had 400 people in the town under
unemployment of a town of about 5,000.

326
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,860
Um, so the stem is enterprise
company. Unfortunately,

327
00:20:43,861 --> 00:20:47,380
because of after World War Two, we
bombed, you know, we bombed Japan,

328
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,720
we bombed Germany, but they
retooled. They rebuilt,

329
00:20:49,721 --> 00:20:54,010
their factory said modern factories
after the war. Um, in the United States.

330
00:20:54,011 --> 00:20:54,850
We didn't do that.

331
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,510
And so the machine tool industry
really fell apart in the early 1960s.

332
00:20:58,511 --> 00:21:03,250
There's a huge economic downturn.
And so I was,

333
00:21:03,251 --> 00:21:07,780
the best experience of my life was
the fact that I grew up in a wealthy

334
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:11,110
environment.
And then when I was 10 or 11 years of age,

335
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,240
the entire financial empire collapsed.

336
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:18,480
We lost everything and we laid off over
400 people in the town were laid off.

337
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:22,490
I'm going to school these, these
kids and their parents, you know,

338
00:21:22,491 --> 00:21:25,360
or not very happy about
what was happening.

339
00:21:25,361 --> 00:21:27,910
It was really a devastating to us.

340
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:32,530
And my parents separated.
We lived in this big house.

341
00:21:32,531 --> 00:21:36,040
Electricity was cut off,
the water was cut off. Um,

342
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:41,080
I remember eating cat food. I was just so
hungry, gave me tremendous parts. Uh, but,

343
00:21:41,081 --> 00:21:45,480
uh, but I, my mom was really desperate.
My brother John went on to Yale.

344
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:50,020
My brother bill was that Cornell.
Um, and um, this is, you know,

345
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,090
towards the end of their
college experiences.

346
00:21:52,091 --> 00:21:55,900
And I was their home alone with
my mother and my twin brother.

347
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:58,720
And I just really had to step up the
plate and help my mother as much as

348
00:21:58,721 --> 00:22:01,470
possible. I remember running
a hose from my neighbors,

349
00:22:01,471 --> 00:22:06,100
so about 500 feet of hose just to get
two or three psi so we could trickle feed

350
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,570
into the toilet so we can flush them.

351
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:12,640
It was really strange in the
lead bewildering sort of,

352
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:17,740
um, Kafkaesque existence because
we were shunned by the town.

353
00:22:17,741 --> 00:22:20,770
My mother went into religion,
my dad went into alcohol.

354
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:22,690
They both were a self
medicating and essentially,

355
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:26,690
and where there's those two avenues.
Um,

356
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:30,850
but I got really good at
helping my mom vacuum, um,

357
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,830
because she didn't help and
we didn't have, you know,

358
00:22:32,831 --> 00:22:34,300
the support team we had any more.

359
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:38,890
So I was always like tearing apart
vacuum cleaners and borrowing parts and

360
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:41,320
trying to get, get and trying
to help my mom. Anyway, I quit.

361
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:43,600
So I vacuum doc and doc here and I got,

362
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:46,340
I'm really still passionate
about vacuuming this one of my,

363
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,390
I'm a really good house husband.
I like washing dishes and vacuuming a lot.

364
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,560
So how this word segues into the
carpenter ants is the following.

365
00:22:53,561 --> 00:22:57,880
So I grew up in an affluent environment.

366
00:22:57,881 --> 00:23:01,510
It came out to Washington state,
became the logger hippie for three years,

367
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:05,010
working in the woods, then moved
outside of Olympia, Washington.

368
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:09,610
I went to the Evergreen state college
and I tried to start this little business

369
00:23:09,611 --> 00:23:13,840
and I lived in a house and a Dr Andrew
Weil said is the worst house he's ever

370
00:23:13,841 --> 00:23:17,800
seen anyone live in, in North
America. Um, that's one statement.

371
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:22,480
It was a flat flat house built with
military surplus materials and I had 12

372
00:23:22,481 --> 00:23:25,810
buckets catching water from the flat roof.

373
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:28,660
Why you need to build a flat roof in
Washington state with army surplus

374
00:23:28,661 --> 00:23:29,920
materials.
This is another question,

375
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:35,220
but there's so many leaks that I just
keep on putting up buckets. And then, um,

376
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:37,750
one day I remember there's a storm and,
and the,

377
00:23:37,751 --> 00:23:40,450
the house fell like two or three
inches in. My wife does, my God,

378
00:23:40,451 --> 00:23:42,160
the house is falling. I
said, don't worry dear.

379
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,530
We don't have to fill the buckets as
much because the water will rot faster.

380
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:47,550
I was just trying to be able
to be optimistic because
I was afraid that she was

381
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:50,300
the one to get up and leave me
because the conditions were so bad.

382
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:55,550
But any aisle I would be making my
espresso in the morning. And um,

383
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:59,350
and I looked over in the corner and
there's a pile of sawdust from carpenter

384
00:23:59,351 --> 00:24:02,630
rats and I see them running
around and the carpenter,

385
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:06,560
carpenter ants are more nocturnal
than they are active in the daytime.

386
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:11,340
And so I'd make my espresso every morning.
I look over the palace,

387
00:24:11,341 --> 00:24:13,370
Sata supportive.
I come clean or vacuum it up.

388
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,020
I did the next day and the next day and
the next day I'd do this for hundreds of

389
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:22,220
days. Realizing the house is getting
more, less structurally song, uh,

390
00:24:22,221 --> 00:24:23,870
w with a carpenter ants and punching them.

391
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:28,180
And so I was not going to do something
about this. And so, you know,

392
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:32,390
I didn't want to use raid. I didn't
want to use toxic insecticides. Um,

393
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:35,340
cause the war against nature,
uh,

394
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:40,040
in my mind is a war against
your own biology and it was
toxic to other organisms

395
00:24:40,041 --> 00:24:43,940
is likely toxic to you. And this has been
well founded now with lots of examples.

396
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:48,200
So I wanted to environmental protection
agency homepage and I looked up a group

397
00:24:48,201 --> 00:24:53,201
of fungi that would attack and these
are called entimopathogenic fungi now.

398
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:56,610
So mouthful but antimony maids,

399
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:00,800
insects and pathogenic means of
course causing disease of insects.

400
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:06,200
And this group of entimopathogenic a fungi
that was particularly of interest and

401
00:25:06,201 --> 00:25:10,520
supported by scientific literature and
with the encouragement of the EPA was a

402
00:25:10,521 --> 00:25:15,240
group of fungi in the genus [inaudible].
So Metta and rising,

403
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:19,560
you know, uh, lots of Mycelium,
lots of rice from works.

404
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:23,060
And so I looked into this group
of men, a matter of Islam, fungi,

405
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:27,380
non toxic to bees, non toxic
to fish, nontoxic to humans.

406
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:31,610
Um, and I, I got some of these fungi
and it started growing them out.

407
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,310
Now I started studying this.
Well, this is really interesting.

408
00:25:34,311 --> 00:25:36,560
Why isn't this not available everywhere,
right?

409
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:40,190
Why isn't there Lowe's and Home Depot and
Walmart? Why aren't they selling this?

410
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,070
Well, for very good reason,
the insects aren't stupid. Um,

411
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:47,030
when you see insects like the carpenter
ants and are constantly cleaning

412
00:25:47,031 --> 00:25:47,864
themselves,

413
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:51,800
they're trying to get the spores of the
fungus off of them is the most common

414
00:25:51,801 --> 00:25:55,280
fungus according to some reports
in the soil underneath your feet.

415
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:58,430
It is everywhere. It is a dance of, of,

416
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:03,080
of dinner and death between insects
and fungi. Many insects eat fungi.

417
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:06,110
Many fungi eat insects.
Um,

418
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:09,740
the two of them don't like to be at
this dinner table at the same time.

419
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:14,660
So I ended up getting this
fungus and I studied it.

420
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:19,310
And the reason why it never came to market
is for the spore repellency property.

421
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:24,230
Now this is really important because
these insects have realized that the scent

422
00:26:24,231 --> 00:26:28,880
of these spores meant that there's
a disease threat to the colony.

423
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:32,600
So the insects fastidiously
clean themselves of these spores.

424
00:26:32,601 --> 00:26:37,601
So when the big companies like bear and
Dow and Syngenta and tried to make bait

425
00:26:38,361 --> 00:26:39,950
stations using these spores,

426
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:43,160
even though in the laboratory that
can dust the insects of the spores,

427
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:47,640
and sure enough, five days later they
would kill the insects. Um, the human,

428
00:26:47,641 --> 00:26:50,310
they put made bait stations
around people's houses.

429
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:54,060
The insects won't go near those base
stations because there's saw the spores.

430
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:59,280
And so the spore repellency property
prevented these bait traps from going into

431
00:26:59,281 --> 00:27:04,280
market for preventing a termites,
firearms, Carpenter ants, uh,

432
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:09,000
moisture rounds, all sorts of, uh, ants
and termites are infected by these, these,

433
00:27:09,001 --> 00:27:13,140
these, this spoilating fungus
matter. Elysium. So I thought, well,

434
00:27:13,141 --> 00:27:15,450
I'm having a laboratory and
a very large laboratories.

435
00:27:15,451 --> 00:27:19,690
We produce about 50,000
kilos of mycelium of the, of,

436
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:23,040
of many different, uh, gourmet
and medicinal mushrooms per week.

437
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:26,790
And my environments are
class 100 clean rooms.

438
00:27:26,791 --> 00:27:29,900
These are high tech clean room
environments using heap, Hepa filters,

439
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:32,550
high efficiency,
particularly air filters. Um,

440
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,720
and the last thing I wanted to spoil,
letting mold in my laboratories.

441
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:41,430
So I got these cultures and I was shocked
at how many spores they world remind

442
00:27:41,431 --> 00:27:43,980
somebody of a penicillium
mold growing on cheese.

443
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,960
Do you want that flying
around your laboratory?

444
00:27:45,961 --> 00:27:49,260
Because my oyster mushroom cultures
or my sheet talky cultures could,

445
00:27:49,261 --> 00:27:53,040
could become contaminated
from airborne spores. So I,

446
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,200
I cultured this out really quickly.

447
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:59,070
And so the window of exposure was very
short and I set up all these precautions

448
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:03,300
and then culturing these fungi and
then they grow out as green molds.

449
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:08,250
And then I saw this white wedge,
the shape wedge that was all white.

450
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:13,080
It had no spoilation on it. And
I went, Whoa, that's interesting.

451
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:16,290
I look up in scientific
literature and everybody said, Oh,

452
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:21,330
the culture is losing the ability to
reproduce and is losing the ability to

453
00:28:21,331 --> 00:28:25,560
spoil your late.
It is sunesson avoid sectors.

454
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:26,491
This is what they're called.

455
00:28:26,491 --> 00:28:31,110
These wedges are white sectors
because that path of genetic,

456
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:36,250
a path down that gene trail will end
up meaning the culture will die and the

457
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,070
parsley got that right.

458
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:41,280
But I was motivated by not
having sports in my laboratory.

459
00:28:41,281 --> 00:28:46,110
So I chased those white sectors and they
grow out and about a week or two weeks

460
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:50,130
on then on a standard size petri dish.
And then after about five or six,

461
00:28:50,131 --> 00:28:51,180
seven transfers,

462
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:56,100
that white wedge got bigger and bigger
and bigger and pretty soon no spoilation.

463
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:59,430
And this is current day in your,
the,

464
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:04,050
this experiment that you were running
was, is, is done more recently,

465
00:29:04,051 --> 00:29:05,880
not when you were under the,

466
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:10,700
the flat roof built by military surplus,
is that right? I'm just trying to put up,

467
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:15,600
no, this is, this is a synchronous with
that, with a flat roof. Okay. Got It.

468
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,750
So,
but I,

469
00:29:16,751 --> 00:29:19,380
I had to go out in my laboratory to
have enough mycelium and be able to,

470
00:29:19,381 --> 00:29:23,160
to treat the carpenter ants.
Gotcha. So anyhow, so I've,

471
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:27,060
I finally grew it out and I grew it on
and rice and I made a big deal to my

472
00:29:27,061 --> 00:29:28,190
daughter.
Um,

473
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:33,180
and I am so thankful to her for the
reasons you're about to hear. Um,

474
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:36,390
and I made a big deal in the middle of
summer saying we're going to trick the

475
00:29:36,391 --> 00:29:39,510
carpenter rounds because every
morning I'm sucking up all those us.

476
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:43,270
And so I asked her for Barbie doll dish,
which I still have,

477
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,200
I'm going to mount it in a frame
and I put like 25 kernels of,

478
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:49,150
of white mycelium on rice,

479
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:54,040
Elysium fungus without spores because
they wouldn't go near the rice if it had

480
00:29:54,041 --> 00:29:54,874
spores.

481
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:59,320
And I laid it out at about eight 30
at night in the summer afternoon,

482
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:02,860
summer evening. And I made a big deal
of it. And it got my daughter involved,

483
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,430
you know, as a citizen scientists
young, she was only, oh my gosh,

484
00:30:06,431 --> 00:30:10,780
she was probably 14 at the time.
And so we, and then we went to bed.

485
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:16,120
So thankfully my daughter woke up at
102 o'clock in the morning and she,

486
00:30:16,121 --> 00:30:17,530
rather than going
straight to the bathroom,

487
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,170
you see one look at her Barbie doll dish.
She went over there talking to license,

488
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:25,720
swarming with carpenter ants. Like, oh
my gosh, you've gotta be kidding. And uh,

489
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:29,350
and so she ran into our bedrooms,
said, uh, dad, dusty, wake up,

490
00:30:29,351 --> 00:30:30,550
you've got to see this.
And you know,

491
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,410
we didn't want to wake up as
two o'clock in the morning,

492
00:30:32,411 --> 00:30:35,920
but she dragged us out of bed and we
went over there and it was just covered

493
00:30:35,921 --> 00:30:38,950
with carbon or rants or picking up
the rice and they're going into the,

494
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:42,190
into the recesses of the house
disappearing and like, oh my God,

495
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,830
that was amazing because I
hadn't mice in the house,

496
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:47,830
the mice could have eaten the
rice and I would never have known.

497
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:52,120
But we watched for a few minutes and
they took away all the myceliated rice.

498
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:57,490
So we fast forward,
I'm making my espresso every morning,

499
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,980
hundreds of times I get
the vacuum cleaner out.

500
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:02,440
I go to that spot and
there's no sought us,

501
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:08,590
the carpenter ants or gone.
And I went, oh my gosh,

502
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:12,520
I just think I figured out a way to
overcome the spore repellency property.

503
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,030
So now this has been elaborated.
We published an article in the journal,

504
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:20,380
sociobiology proving this was effective
against subterranean termites.

505
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:24,830
Formosan termites. We've done
experiments is now in the Usda, uh,

506
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:26,740
and other, uh, teams,

507
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:30,460
some of the biggest pesticide
companies in the world. Um,

508
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:33,940
I'd have to check my NDAs to see
if they're still covered or not.

509
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:36,970
But everyone listening,
you can imagine who they are.

510
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:41,980
They tested this is effective
against bedbugs ants,

511
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:46,480
termites, uh, thrips flies, mosquitoes,

512
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,760
um, you know, uh,

513
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:51,880
mites phenomenal reach.

514
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:57,270
And so I ended up finding something that
is a super attractant and basically the

515
00:31:58,211 --> 00:32:02,560
opposite of the spore repellency property
is the mycelial attract unsee property.

516
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:06,010
Two sides of the same coin,
the ying and Yang of nature.

517
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:08,200
It's kind of harmonious and that sense.
I like that.

518
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:13,390
And we found that if we
diluted the mycelial extracts
on rice without the spores,

519
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:17,890
this, these continual, these preclinical
pre spoilating sectors that I described,

520
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:20,270
we end up creating a super attractive,

521
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:25,300
so powerful that when they attracted was
diluted 500 to one with water diluting

522
00:32:26,951 --> 00:32:31,300
the extract, made it more potent in terms
of attract, unsee it. One experiment,

523
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:36,340
two drops of this on a pane of
glass and fire ants, uh, uh,

524
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:41,370
locked directly to that place and
scratched at that place until they died

525
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,090
walking about a meter,
uh,

526
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:48,860
creating a trail that other
than a fire ants would follow.

527
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:53,480
So that we have done this now
with choices are called t tests.

528
00:32:53,481 --> 00:32:55,580
We've known this was the
t test or even better,

529
00:32:55,581 --> 00:32:59,720
a t test oftentimes is go left for the
control go right from the treatment.

530
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:05,050
But we ended up doing four and five choice
experiments where there was only one

531
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:10,190
corridor or avenue that had the treatment
and the other ones were all controls.

532
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:14,480
Uh, so highly significant activity.
And we found something that I can,

533
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,120
my dream is to be able to,
uh,

534
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:21,730
to attract a locust plague
into a 55 gallon drum and
we can put these in foggers

535
00:33:21,951 --> 00:33:25,880
and you know, in Africa and
just create a massive, huge,

536
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,280
a huge attractor NC factor.

537
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:32,540
The cool thing also is they attract
and C is not lethal. Um, so, um, that,

538
00:33:32,541 --> 00:33:35,420
that, that comes later, the
infectious state of the mycelium,

539
00:33:35,421 --> 00:33:40,160
it grows and then it penetrates the,
the Exoskeleton with a Hyphal peg.

540
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:44,390
It kind of anchors itself like sticky
little tongue and then it dissolves

541
00:33:44,391 --> 00:33:45,081
exoskeleton,

542
00:33:45,081 --> 00:33:48,470
the Chitin and then the Hypo peg
invades into the body of the insect.

543
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:49,640
And mummify is them.

544
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:52,640
So these are many people have
heard about these Zombie fungi.

545
00:33:52,641 --> 00:33:53,970
This is what they are.
Uh,

546
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:57,410
some of them have a cordyceps
representation is a little club,

547
00:33:57,411 --> 00:34:01,830
fungi and Costa Rica and elsewhere
in the subtropics, the, um,

548
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:02,510
um,

549
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:07,220
many of the ants there are well known
for the leaf cutter ants and other ants

550
00:34:07,221 --> 00:34:09,680
are known that they have to
get infected with this fungus.

551
00:34:09,681 --> 00:34:14,250
They climb to the top canopy of the
trees and they locked her mandible

552
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:18,080
underneath the leaf and bullying a
mushroom comes out of their head and their

553
00:34:18,081 --> 00:34:21,550
anus, uh, and a sport lights in
this way, the fungus gets us sporty,

554
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,930
late and free air conditions
high up in the canopy.

555
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:29,060
So it causes uncontrolled behavior
of climbing with these insects.

556
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:34,010
So this item,
it's breakthrough and the reason why,

557
00:34:34,011 --> 00:34:38,570
and I ended up licensing in this to a
group of investors and I got $1 million.

558
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:42,230
And, uh, so I like to
tell my daughter, um,

559
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:44,840
she was very instrumental in this and,
um,

560
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:48,920
the licensing agreement
had some limits on it.

561
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:50,740
They had to take it to
market within five years.

562
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:54,440
I pulled back to the licensing agreement.
Um, and they didn't take it the market.

563
00:34:54,441 --> 00:34:57,730
So I pulled it back and everything
is actually quite friendly. Um,

564
00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:01,550
but it's a little bit of a mystery
why he did not make it to market. Um,

565
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:05,360
and I have a lot of conspiracy theories
as to why I did not make it to market.

566
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:08,420
Um, I hesitate to mention those. Um,

567
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:12,860
but I was given a chunk of change and
I was smart enough to realize that they

568
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:14,870
can't crush this and that was a condition.

569
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,330
This has to come to market
but doesn't come to market.

570
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:21,950
Then I get the patent rights back and
now I've been issued a nine patents on

571
00:35:21,951 --> 00:35:24,980
this. People can go to the u s
patent homepage and look them up.

572
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:30,730
The latest patent that was issued on
this two years ago is really phenomenal

573
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:36,760
because I have patents on the antiviral
properties of mycelium and have these

574
00:35:37,441 --> 00:35:42,441
patents on these entimopathogenic
fungi were all insects in all diseases

575
00:35:44,161 --> 00:35:46,680
vectored by in sucks.
It doesn't get bigger than that.

576
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:50,440
Are there any types of, and um, uh, there,

577
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:54,850
there are a number of different areas
I want to dig deeper. Are there,

578
00:35:54,851 --> 00:35:59,851
are there any particular common viruses
or particularly lethal viruses that

579
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:04,780
you've seen applications
for using mycelium

580
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:08,830
in terms of resistance or defeating?

581
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:14,810
Yeah, well, there's there, there's
a lot of examples of that. Um,

582
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:20,870
and so I published an article
and a journal peer reviewed
journal called Herbal

583
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:25,370
Graham and in June of 2001 summarizing a,

584
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,970
all the literature that's
been published on the,

585
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:33,140
on the antiviral properties of mushroom
mycelium is a whopping one page long

586
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:38,280
with like six references. The
virtually very, very little out there.

587
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:42,960
Well that was in June of 2001
September 11th, 2001, you know,

588
00:36:42,961 --> 00:36:45,270
nine 11 occurred very quickly.

589
00:36:45,271 --> 00:36:49,070
The greatest concern for the
US Defense Department and,

590
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:53,770
and biosecurity was a
weapon izable viruses, uh,

591
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:57,210
pox viruses, you know,
anthrax is a bacteria.

592
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:59,580
The anthrax attacks
occurred a few weeks later,

593
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:04,740
a group of researchers in the US Defense
Department where scabbing Jane the

594
00:37:04,741 --> 00:37:08,520
literature saw my article and I said,
wow, there's some evidence here.

595
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:11,850
And they contacted me because I
had a very large, large library.

596
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,910
Now it may sound large to
people who don't have libraries.

597
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:18,650
I have about 800 strains of a
different species of mushrooms, Co,

598
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,000
many of which collected from
the old growth forest. Uh,

599
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:24,810
it's now some libraries have
20,000, you know, uh, culture.

600
00:37:24,811 --> 00:37:28,710
So I'm small compared to them, but I'm
private. I'm not a big institution.

601
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:31,150
And so they said, well, listen, you've,

602
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,780
you've probably some interesting
articles here. There's some evidence.

603
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:39,060
We have been this, the fund funded by
Dick Cheney and George George Bush.

604
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:39,901
Ironically,

605
00:37:39,901 --> 00:37:43,550
I have a debt of gratitude to them
with a bio shield by defense program.

606
00:37:43,551 --> 00:37:48,390
It's called project biodefense, but then
became known as the Bio Shield program.

607
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:54,170
And so they elicited my support and
then I begin to send them cultures,

608
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:58,800
mushrooms,
boiled and hot water,

609
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:02,700
ethanol extracts of the mushrooms and
mycelium that gave rise to the mushrooms,

610
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:04,111
et Cetera,
et cetera.

611
00:38:04,111 --> 00:38:08,520
And so I ended up sending out a set
them a hundred of these samples. I mean,

612
00:38:08,521 --> 00:38:12,170
this is for me, this is a coup d'etat.
I have government laboratories,

613
00:38:12,171 --> 00:38:15,780
I'll give me free research,
you know, on my extracts.

614
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:20,880
And so we started sending these out
and didn't hear from them for awhile.

615
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,880
And, um, and he's realized
there were really disorganized.

616
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:28,470
It was a new program and I got a colonel,
I love that you mentioned his name.

617
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:32,460
He worked at Fort Dietrich, you know,
where they have smallpox and you know,

618
00:38:32,461 --> 00:38:37,260
it's a bio bio weapons facility biohazard,
um,

619
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:38,770
facility.
The US government,

620
00:38:38,771 --> 00:38:42,700
we have the most pathogenic bacteria
and viruses and other disease organisms.

621
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:48,360
And so I had an MD person who was
my controller it federal express.

622
00:38:48,401 --> 00:38:51,820
One day, you know, about two months
later after I submitted the extracts,

623
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:57,250
a dumper made this big package of
research reports on anti POCs properties,

624
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:01,630
smallpox properties of our
extracts. Well, I mean,

625
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,730
going through it and no activity,
no activity.

626
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:08,760
I get the sample number 78 I activity
against pox viruses and then sample 81

627
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:14,200
high activity sample 88
high activity. Whoa. I mean,

628
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:15,071
it's like,
you know,

629
00:39:15,071 --> 00:39:20,071
you're looking at a not effective
and no results in the first 77 pages.

630
00:39:20,621 --> 00:39:24,790
You know, it's pretty disappointing. Then
Bam, I got really excited. So I called my,

631
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:28,770
I called up my colonel,
uh, Fort Dietrich and,

632
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:33,010
and I said, these results are amazing.
It's exciting. And he goes, what results?

633
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:35,500
I got the results that Federal
Express just delivered to me. He goes,

634
00:39:35,501 --> 00:39:37,690
you're not supposed to get
those. I am. I said, well,

635
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:39,990
I'll make a photocopy and
I'll send them to you.

636
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,960
That he didn't appreciate the humor,
but it was a very,

637
00:39:43,961 --> 00:39:46,840
very bizarre time and some very,

638
00:39:46,841 --> 00:39:50,530
very strange things have occurred,
um,

639
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,060
that at that time.

640
00:39:52,061 --> 00:39:57,061
But we ended up finding that those three
highly active results came from an old

641
00:39:58,091 --> 00:40:00,430
growth mushroom called a guera con.
Now,

642
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:04,090
Gary Econ is the longest living mushroom
in the world, number one or number two,

643
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:07,540
some debate about that grows
exclusively in the old growth forest,

644
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:10,480
northern California, Oregon,
Washington and British Columbia,

645
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:15,370
and a few Sky Islands in Europe. And,
and um, the outs as the Slovenia,

646
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:19,030
uh, um, and Austria on large trees,

647
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:22,720
but it is an indicator species
of an old growth forest.

648
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:28,020
And those three anti ox results came from
three different separate strains of a

649
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:33,910
Garrick con than isolated, um, from my
many adventures in the old growth forest.

650
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:38,170
So whoa,
this has got people very excited.

651
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:42,640
Now I love to be taken to the
mat. I'm referenced driven. Okay.

652
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:45,700
So anybody out there is skeptical of this.
You can do two things.

653
00:40:45,701 --> 00:40:50,701
You can Google my name Stamets national
public radio and PR and POCs and you'll

654
00:40:52,061 --> 00:40:56,260
see a vetted press release interview
on National Public Radio with me.

655
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:01,680
The former deputy director of the FDA
and the head of one of the research

656
00:41:02,041 --> 00:41:03,880
division is about shield
by defense program,

657
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:08,230
Dr Jack Secrets from Southern
Research University. So,

658
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:09,460
and then

659
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:15,310
so because I'm in competition with
Pharma and I'm a lone researcher,

660
00:41:15,311 --> 00:41:18,820
how the Little Company and
um, I thought, well, I'm like,

661
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:23,170
I checked into this and I already had
this entimopathogenic fungi patents that

662
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:24,790
were just,
you know,

663
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:28,780
tremendous achievements because the entire
pesticide industry missed all of that.

664
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:32,140
Um, so I thought, well, this is
novel. I should protect myself.

665
00:41:32,141 --> 00:41:36,770
So I filed a patent it on a
gear icon against viruses,

666
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:41,390
uh, particularly pox
viruses, flu viruses, herpes,

667
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:43,610
these are all the other
results that we received.

668
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:46,740
These extracts are highly active
against multiple viruses. It's national,

669
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:50,810
not pox viruses. Quick question for you,
is that prevent for preventative use?

670
00:41:50,811 --> 00:41:54,970
Curator to use both.
What are the applications?

671
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:59,780
This is Tim where I have to draw the
line, um, because these are in vitro,

672
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:05,400
in vitro tests with human cells
and taking through three different,

673
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:06,790
uh,
uh,

674
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:11,910
testing protocols to the point where
the next task is in, uh, in, uh,

675
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,720
in Vivo model, right?
And it was an animal.

676
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:20,030
So this is the best pharmaceutical drug
discovery that you can go through before

677
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:24,580
you get to get to go to a living host.
These are living human cells, uh, in,

678
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:28,710
in vitro, not in Vivo. In Vivo means this,

679
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:34,640
you know, as small mammal, like
an, uh, uh, a mouse, you know,

680
00:42:34,641 --> 00:42:38,270
a rat, you know, a monkey or, or it
goes into human clinical studies.

681
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,790
So these are vitro testing and to be,

682
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:45,050
even though we have identified now
the molecules that are active against

683
00:42:45,051 --> 00:42:45,950
smallpox,

684
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:51,530
we worked with the University
of Mississippi School
of pharmacy under Dr Cmr

685
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:52,010
Ross.

686
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:55,820
We did come out and guided fractionation
over many years and we have identified

687
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:59,750
two new anti POCs molecules,

688
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:03,810
more potent than side Dapa beer,
which is the preeminent, uh,

689
00:43:03,970 --> 00:43:08,240
comparative antiviral drug
control with less toxicity.

690
00:43:08,270 --> 00:43:13,100
And more efficacy than sendoff at Vera.
But that being said,

691
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:19,130
there's clearly an upregulation of
the immune system and so what is the

692
00:43:19,131 --> 00:43:22,700
contribution of these molecules versus
upgrading of the immune system is a

693
00:43:22,701 --> 00:43:23,690
combination of both.

694
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:27,230
Is there a synergism is there's
multiple molecules being engaged,

695
00:43:27,231 --> 00:43:30,860
multiple immune pathways.
This is where you can get lost.

696
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:32,420
You cannot see the forest for the trees.

697
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:37,040
If you end up focusing so much on the
mechanisms of action and don't see the

698
00:43:37,041 --> 00:43:41,480
result. If you were infected
with the money's viruses,

699
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,550
you didn't really don't care
about the mechanism of action.

700
00:43:43,551 --> 00:43:46,520
You just wanted to know whether
you can overcome the virus or not.

701
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:51,910
So we have found the anti epox molecules.

702
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:58,240
We have not yet found the anti flu
or the anti herpes molecules today.

703
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:04,550
And I have another really good example
of is specific to your original question.

704
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:08,570
The mycelium being active against viruses.

705
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:10,810
Can I pause for one quick second and see.

706
00:44:10,850 --> 00:44:15,850
I have to know what happened after the
lieutenant call because I imagine someone

707
00:44:16,071 --> 00:44:19,910
on his end had to have their head
role for that type of security breach,

708
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:23,600
mailing FedEx to the wrong place
with those research reports.

709
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:26,210
What happened after that?
Oh my God,

710
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,700
I don't have to make up these stories.

711
00:44:28,701 --> 00:44:31,860
I don't have to make up any stories
are too good to be true as they are,

712
00:44:31,861 --> 00:44:34,290
but this is what happened.
I was in Canada.

713
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:37,140
I'm speaking to you right now from
Cortez Island, British Columbia.

714
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:42,620
I was up here on Cortez Island and one
of my employees called up and said,

715
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:47,790
Paul, there's a helicopter buzzing around
the laboratories. I go, no big deal.

716
00:44:47,791 --> 00:44:51,750
Helicopters fly over all the time,
and he goes, no, it's really low.

717
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:54,270
And I go, how low? And he goes, listen.

718
00:44:54,330 --> 00:44:58,650
He puts a cell phone up to the back
of your tongue. I go, well, I go,

719
00:44:58,651 --> 00:45:00,900
what are the numbers on the tail?
He goes,

720
00:45:00,901 --> 00:45:05,901
there are new numbers as a Black Hawk
military helicopter that's right on top of

721
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:10,710
the laboratories. I go, oh
my God, you're kidding. I go,

722
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,660
and this is right after
we got the pox results.

723
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:14,160
Right after I talked to the colonel,
you know,

724
00:45:14,161 --> 00:45:17,190
like two weeks later or a week
later. And I said, okay, listen,

725
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,110
shut down the business. I
knew immediately, you know,

726
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,970
the government is going to screw up
here and they're going out there and an

727
00:45:22,971 --> 00:45:25,770
abundance of caution, they're going
to end up overstepping their bounds.

728
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:29,190
And I said, this is crazy. I've already
been vetted. I've already been permitted.

729
00:45:29,191 --> 00:45:32,050
I've already in dialogue with
these people. Uh, and they,

730
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:34,620
they're trying to spook me.
I mean, what's going on here?

731
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:38,790
So I shut down the business at the time,
only had 10 employees.

732
00:45:38,791 --> 00:45:42,780
Now I have a hundred. Um, and I
said, so shut down the business,

733
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:45,720
give the cultures of Americon
to several of the employees.

734
00:45:45,721 --> 00:45:48,050
I never want to know who has them.
You know,

735
00:45:48,070 --> 00:45:50,820
let's decentralize our
self as a target right now.

736
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:54,420
And so I shut down the business,
all of the employees left, you know,

737
00:45:54,421 --> 00:45:55,830
and the helicopter is
still buzzing around.

738
00:45:56,190 --> 00:46:01,020
And so the next day I called up pretty
pissed off to the colonel and saying,

739
00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:04,260
what is going on?
You know?

740
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:08,680
And he got really nervous. Now
he's got two black eyes, right?

741
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:12,900
They delivered the wrong results,
right, results to the wrong person.

742
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:15,760
And now that one, you know, he
goes, oh, the government, you know,

743
00:46:15,761 --> 00:46:19,440
on one hand doesn't talk to the other.
And they got over exuberant and you know,

744
00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:20,380
in,
you know,

745
00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:24,880
terrorist got this technology that could
immunize themselves and their credit

746
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:28,770
and it's like whatever,
you know. So anyhow,

747
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:31,140
it's funny because I was
going through the airports.

748
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:35,340
I got five stars on every
single airline ticket.

749
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:39,030
I joke to my wife, here we go again, I'm
gonna get stopped and searched, you know,

750
00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:41,400
and then after this,
then all those,

751
00:46:41,401 --> 00:46:45,570
those five stars got taken away and I
stream through security to no problem.

752
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:50,190
But I was obviously suddenly on their
radar because I'm, I'm a nonconventional.

753
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:53,080
Um, but the fact that
I'm here today, actually,

754
00:46:53,081 --> 00:46:56,100
it makes me more of a pitch
Arctic American than I was before.

755
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:59,500
So then he,
so this is,

756
00:46:59,501 --> 00:47:03,670
so I found these continents I patent on,
on the Cara con versus these viruses.

757
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:07,980
I found it in 2004. You can look this
up, go to the u s patent homepage,

758
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:11,370
you'll see my filing dates.
I filed this patent in 2004.

759
00:47:11,371 --> 00:47:15,990
2009 11 was 2001 so I had to write
to pat and get more research results.

760
00:47:15,991 --> 00:47:19,620
We got lots and lots of positive
results from the Bio Shield program.

761
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:23,850
I think they, I talked to him when
the researchers last year and he goes,

762
00:47:23,851 --> 00:47:28,170
do you know that we analyzed
2,392 of your samples? Taiwan,

763
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:31,320
I'm so I didn't have to pay for that.
Um,

764
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:36,860
but we got about 40 excellent
hits from my 800 or so cultures.

765
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:39,760
Um, uh, that were surprising. Um,

766
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:44,790
which has led into I think a paradigm
shifting solution that for many of the

767
00:47:44,891 --> 00:47:48,670
problems that we face today,
but I thought filed this patent in 2004,

768
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:51,970
2006 is not even on the patent
application or homepage.

769
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:54,370
Anybody out there who
didn't know about patents.

770
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,260
It's usually six months to a year.

771
00:47:56,261 --> 00:48:00,610
That patent application shows up
at the U S P t o. Dot. Gov website,

772
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:05,020
US patent and trademark office,
a.gov website.

773
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:08,830
And it didn't show up. It's over
two years. So I called her hold,

774
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:11,380
my patent attorney gone,
you know what is going on here?

775
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:14,800
He gets a hold of the patent office
and the Department of Defense took the

776
00:48:14,801 --> 00:48:19,750
patent out of the patent office
because of national security. I said,

777
00:48:19,751 --> 00:48:23,020
you're kidding. That's kind of a pat
on my back. I was like, wow, really?

778
00:48:23,021 --> 00:48:25,990
You think that's not important?
Um, but I said, that's not right.

779
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:30,990
So we did an intergovernmental agency
trace and a request and the dod finally

780
00:48:31,311 --> 00:48:34,090
released a patent to
go back into the queue.

781
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:38,770
And so 10 years after I
submitted a patent application,

782
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,230
folks,
usually two to three years,

783
00:48:41,231 --> 00:48:45,820
you get a ruling 10 years after I
smoothed the pattern, it was approved.

784
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,120
That's a long way as it has a long way.
The good news is,

785
00:48:49,121 --> 00:48:53,890
is there a proven 2014 so I've got 17
years. And the whole thing about patents,

786
00:48:53,891 --> 00:48:56,650
I mean we would not be talking
today if there weren't patents.

787
00:48:56,950 --> 00:48:59,920
People think of patents become
open source after 17 years.

788
00:48:59,921 --> 00:49:02,290
The idea is to reward the inventor,

789
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:07,680
to incentivize things to come to market
because a patent that is not practiced

790
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:11,980
is not useful or beneficial to society.
You know,

791
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:15,970
within that 17 years or outside the 17
years, it has to be brought to market.

792
00:49:15,970 --> 00:49:20,110
There has to be a commercial center.
Patents are awarded for three reasons.

793
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:23,920
One, no prior art, no evidence.

794
00:49:23,921 --> 00:49:27,400
And then the to victor or
proper literature of anyone
saying is having the same

795
00:49:27,401 --> 00:49:30,640
idea to an obviousness.

796
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,800
You want experts saying, Paul Stamets,
you're full of BS. This will never work.

797
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:39,190
And so I have a message to all my critics
out there. I want to say thank you.

798
00:49:39,370 --> 00:49:41,890
You've helped me so much in
ways that you did not intend.

799
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:44,900
But I'm really happy that
some people these days.

800
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:49,960
And the third is usefulness. So
those three things, no prior art,

801
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:54,700
contrary to conventional wisdom. You
know, and, and usefulness. And so,

802
00:49:55,120 --> 00:50:00,020
you know, obviously that fits all three
of those categories so that then the, the,

803
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:04,210
the molecules are, I have not patents
and patented. They're open source.

804
00:50:04,211 --> 00:50:07,600
Hopefully we'll never have a
smallpox epidemic or pandemic again.

805
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:10,890
And I think that's obviously
it serves a greater good.

806
00:50:11,450 --> 00:50:16,450
So another followup question that, uh,

807
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:20,150
out of self interest, I'd love to
ask related to the carpenter ants.

808
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:24,890
So for people who are eager to try
to address something with carpenter,

809
00:50:24,891 --> 00:50:28,730
and specifically,
are there any current recommendations

810
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,470
that you would have,
number one,

811
00:50:30,471 --> 00:50:34,250
and then talking about conventional
or contrary to conventional wisdom?

812
00:50:34,251 --> 00:50:35,540
I think at this point
people are wondering,

813
00:50:35,541 --> 00:50:39,280
how did this guy become so
obsessed with this stuff? Uh,

814
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:42,440
so I do want to roll back
the clock and talk about,

815
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:46,790
among other things your stutter,
but first I have to know,

816
00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:50,810
is there anything you would recommend as
it relates to carpenter ants or is it a

817
00:50:50,811 --> 00:50:51,644
waiting game?

818
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:56,420
Well, they, they test him. A
patent is that it's reproducible.

819
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:03,220
The EPA and Usda now are allowing this
fungus and food handling facilities,

820
00:51:03,861 --> 00:51:08,861
the first fungus ever to be allowed for
controlling insects and food handling

821
00:51:09,591 --> 00:51:12,470
facilities. It has that safe. The safety,

822
00:51:12,471 --> 00:51:16,120
the safety documents supplied
by the EPA are now, uh,

823
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:17,960
open source and then public domain.

824
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:21,650
So the companies that did all the
research proving that this fungus was not

825
00:51:21,651 --> 00:51:24,920
dangerous. Uh, now I released all
of our commercial interest in it.

826
00:51:26,030 --> 00:51:29,300
This train of met [inaudible] called
[inaudible] two is that public domain

827
00:51:29,301 --> 00:51:31,080
strain?
Um,

828
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:36,520
so what I'm saying is you're not legal
for you to go out and use this and

829
00:51:37,431 --> 00:51:41,610
commercialize it without EPA
administration. Uh, but that Tesla,

830
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,040
the patent is reproducible.

831
00:51:43,610 --> 00:51:48,230
And so all of the methods for
doing this is published. And I'm,

832
00:51:48,890 --> 00:51:49,723
and I'm,

833
00:51:49,790 --> 00:51:54,790
I just submitted my entire portfolio
with all my research on all eight or nine

834
00:51:55,251 --> 00:51:56,084
patents,

835
00:51:56,210 --> 00:52:00,230
all the documentation of all these
companies that have done the research,

836
00:52:00,290 --> 00:52:05,120
you know, in themselves. Um,
and I've submitted to a very,

837
00:52:05,121 --> 00:52:09,410
very well known company that
has an extremely potent, uh,

838
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:12,650
insecticide that many people
know that use it on the market.

839
00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:17,830
And as the word I got back is why would
we want to disrupt a proven profit wheel

840
00:52:19,790 --> 00:52:21,410
is something that we,

841
00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:26,450
my aunts did not reinvented for 10 years
because after the ants were killed,

842
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:28,870
the carpenter ants,
they sporulated.

843
00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:32,870
So the spore repellency property
prevented future invasions.

844
00:52:33,170 --> 00:52:37,520
That's not a very good economic model
when you can treat a house once and they

845
00:52:37,521 --> 00:52:42,521
don't come back a far better economic
business plan is having consumer buying it

846
00:52:42,581 --> 00:52:46,280
every month and spraying toxic
chemicals that killed the workers,

847
00:52:46,281 --> 00:52:47,900
but don't kill the queen.
The whole,

848
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:51,470
the whole key to this is the
mycelium is taken back into the nest.

849
00:52:51,770 --> 00:52:56,770
Like a Trojan horse is presented to the
queen who then presents to the brood and

850
00:52:57,141 --> 00:53:01,900
they're all living in this honey.
This sort of my ciliated uh, um,

851
00:53:02,070 --> 00:53:05,180
um, uh, a palace. Uh,

852
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:08,030
and then before they realize it,

853
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:12,620
it's sporty lates and it kills the queen.
They can kill the queen.

854
00:53:12,621 --> 00:53:15,110
You can control call the
colony after a spoiler lace.

855
00:53:15,290 --> 00:53:19,520
The spore repellency property prevents
other were carpenter ants from coming

856
00:53:19,521 --> 00:53:24,080
into your house. So it's a 10
year solution for about 25 cents.

857
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:27,600
Um, that's what it costs to produce. Of
course, the packaging and all that stuff.

858
00:53:27,601 --> 00:53:30,960
You'd add up the numbers pretty quickly,
but is incredibly,

859
00:53:30,990 --> 00:53:34,890
it's very inexpensive to produce and
it can be produced in huge quantities.

860
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:39,390
So it did not make it to market.
And I, I, I'm exasperated.

861
00:53:40,670 --> 00:53:41,490
Um,

862
00:53:41,490 --> 00:53:46,490
I one really great story on this that
this woman named Chris and that works for

863
00:53:46,621 --> 00:53:49,980
a company that has three
letters in their name. She was,

864
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:55,170
she was given the mandate because of the
stockholders were really upset because

865
00:53:55,171 --> 00:54:00,171
of the reputation of this company causing
toxic spills that harmed thousands of

866
00:54:01,171 --> 00:54:05,760
people and they wanted it to grow green
movement. Can you find green solutions?

867
00:54:05,761 --> 00:54:10,510
She was given the mandate to find a green
solution to replace toxic insecticides.

868
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:15,450
He says, given a budget. And she
found me, we dialogue for months.

869
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:16,590
I gave her samples,

870
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:20,250
she set up experiments to the
researchers who were so excited.

871
00:54:20,251 --> 00:54:22,410
They called me up at home
and both of them said,

872
00:54:22,411 --> 00:54:23,580
I'm not supposed to be telling you this,

873
00:54:23,581 --> 00:54:27,180
but this is the most exciting thing
we've ever seen in our life. You know,

874
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:30,600
as as as entomologist and
fighting these problems,

875
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:35,070
she went to the board of directors
are the priority, were going, we,

876
00:54:35,090 --> 00:54:39,390
we connected whenever the data
together and messaging, you know,

877
00:54:39,450 --> 00:54:43,160
how to create, you know, the most clear
communication to the board of directors,

878
00:54:43,170 --> 00:54:47,760
all men. And she was a steal at Magnolia,
Magnolia. I've never met her in person.

879
00:54:47,761 --> 00:54:50,340
I wanted to hire her immediately.
She ran these, these,

880
00:54:50,341 --> 00:54:54,050
these meetings just so professionally
and she was really excited and she went,

881
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:56,160
go down and the next day in the afternoon,

882
00:54:56,161 --> 00:55:00,750
I'm waiting for her call and she calls
and the person on the phone is so angry.

883
00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:05,400
I'm going, who is this? And I
go, this is Chris. She goes,

884
00:55:05,401 --> 00:55:09,150
I'm so angry. I can't see
straight. I go, I mean,

885
00:55:09,151 --> 00:55:13,410
she's totally composed before and
she's lost her composure. I go, Chris,

886
00:55:13,411 --> 00:55:17,190
what happened? She goes, I went
in there, I made my presentation,

887
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:22,110
all men and looked at me
steely-eyed and she said,

888
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:25,470
this is the best you gave me this mandate.
I have found something.

889
00:55:25,471 --> 00:55:28,170
It's a game changer. They can, again,

890
00:55:28,350 --> 00:55:32,460
we can come with an ecologically rational
and sustainable solution based on

891
00:55:32,461 --> 00:55:34,550
nature.
Um,

892
00:55:34,830 --> 00:55:39,830
and they looked at her and a dour face
and then the chairman of the company

893
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:43,770
looked at her and said, Chris, you're
a budget. Never was in research.

894
00:55:44,130 --> 00:55:45,510
It was an advertising,

895
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:51,060
very much similar to BP,
beyond petroleum.

896
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:56,670
How much of the BPS budget actually is
an alternative fuels versus how much is

897
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:58,080
an oil?
Now,

898
00:55:58,081 --> 00:56:03,081
how much of their advertising budget is
in alternative fuels as opposed so oil,

899
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:08,640
I mean, clearly it's called
greenwashing. And um, and so, so that,

900
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:12,570
that was, and that just so that, that
happened like seven or eight years ago.

901
00:56:13,050 --> 00:56:15,930
And then this past month I just
had the same thing happen again.

902
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:17,430
It's a disruptive technology.

903
00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:20,820
It rocks the apple cart in many of
these insecticides are coming from the

904
00:56:20,821 --> 00:56:24,010
petroleum industry as byproducts
from their waste material.

905
00:56:24,230 --> 00:56:24,480
So,

906
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:29,480
so I want to talk disruptive and something
challenging to the status quo and

907
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:35,550
contrary to most conventional wisdom.
But that requires going way,

908
00:56:35,551 --> 00:56:36,360
way back.

909
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:40,560
And talking a bit about
perhaps your childhood,

910
00:56:40,561 --> 00:56:42,960
which you described in part already,

911
00:56:43,290 --> 00:56:48,290
but when did you develop a stutter and
why don't you still have a stutter?

912
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,660
Uh, when I started stuttering,
when really when I was, um,

913
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:58,540
probably about five years old, I mean I
started from the time that I could talk,

914
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:01,530
um,
my family was this fun,

915
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:06,430
dysfunctional and I've been told that
sometimes the type of stuttering that I

916
00:57:06,431 --> 00:57:10,900
have is that is related to a defect,
um,

917
00:57:11,190 --> 00:57:14,470
and neurological development in
the seventh and eighth months.

918
00:57:14,471 --> 00:57:17,200
That's one possible reason.

919
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:21,490
But the type of study when I have
anyone seen the king's speech,

920
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:24,430
I had that and worse.
So I

921
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:31,460
just could not speak and I'd
find alternative pathways
to trick my brain with a

922
00:57:32,321 --> 00:57:36,580
preposition or adverbial phrase because
your brain gets further ahead in your

923
00:57:36,581 --> 00:57:41,200
mouth, can articulate and then
you become self conscious.

924
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:45,030
And the type of stutterer
that I am as most observers,

925
00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:46,510
we don't stutter when we sin.

926
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:52,280
We don't stutter if I start
speaking in that British accent, uh,

927
00:57:52,430 --> 00:57:56,200
or you create an accent and you don't
stutter when you talk to animals.

928
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:59,060
So it's a very interesting,
it's a,

929
00:57:59,061 --> 00:58:01,900
something that's triggered
by social contact.

930
00:58:02,890 --> 00:58:06,730
And so it was very difficult
for me to date ladies.

931
00:58:06,790 --> 00:58:10,030
They wanted the super jocks,
the self assured men.

932
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:12,070
And I was a stutterer.

933
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:15,670
And so I used to always start at the
ground and I found fossils I found

934
00:58:15,671 --> 00:58:19,570
mushrooms on,
but it's very difficult for me now.

935
00:58:20,350 --> 00:58:25,350
I grew up in a small town in Ohio and
my dad was a officer in the air craft

936
00:58:25,601 --> 00:58:30,310
carrier and the intrepid and soda and
World War Two. So after World War Two,

937
00:58:30,311 --> 00:58:34,420
he got the intrepid aircraft carrier
radio and it was in our basement.

938
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:38,450
And so my brother John, who was
very interested in chemistry, uh,

939
00:58:38,530 --> 00:58:42,040
he created this huge, you know, huge,

940
00:58:42,041 --> 00:58:46,300
like three racks of chemicals, you know,
in the basement and his laboratory.

941
00:58:46,630 --> 00:58:50,800
He had bunsen burners, all sorts of
experiments going on all the time. And,

942
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:54,640
but he never let me quote unquote play
in laboratory. I can play on the radio.

943
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:55,840
And I could watch him,
but he's,

944
00:58:55,841 --> 00:58:58,030
my older brother was the
youngest one in my family. So,

945
00:58:58,630 --> 00:59:00,100
and so John went on to Yale,

946
00:59:00,101 --> 00:59:04,450
my brother built on to Cornell and they
left and they left me in this laboratory.

947
00:59:04,451 --> 00:59:07,360
So I, my dream was always to
have a laboratory, you know,

948
00:59:07,390 --> 00:59:11,290
and living in the country and that
kind of what I'm doing now. But John,

949
00:59:11,291 --> 00:59:12,460
when he came back from Yale,

950
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:17,600
came back with a book
called altered states of
consciousness by Charles tart and

951
00:59:18,101 --> 00:59:23,101
it was an anthology of research articles
on changing your consciousness of them,

952
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:28,750
either drugs or from
spinning or from dreams.

953
00:59:30,050 --> 00:59:32,210
One of the early books from
years of California at Davis.

954
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:36,470
So John lent me this book and I said,
Johnny, I'm there like to see it,

955
00:59:36,471 --> 00:59:38,600
but he says it well cause
I'm on break for two weeks,

956
00:59:38,601 --> 00:59:40,310
but I need the book
because part of our class.

957
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:44,250
So I got this book and I'm just
devouring this book, you know. And,

958
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:45,980
and John was my hero.

959
00:59:46,010 --> 00:59:50,570
He was my mentor and John went to Mexico
and Columbia came back with incredible

960
00:59:50,571 --> 00:59:54,620
stories of magic mushrooms and
consuming them. You know, I just,

961
00:59:54,621 --> 00:59:57,890
I adored him. Of course I wanted to do
the same. Then it gave me this book.

962
00:59:57,891 --> 00:59:59,990
And so I'm really getting
excited about this,

963
00:59:59,991 --> 01:00:04,991
but my best friend Ryan Snyder
wanted also to read this book.

964
01:00:05,690 --> 01:00:08,360
And so Ryan Goes, can I borrow your
book now? Your Brother's book? I go,

965
01:00:08,361 --> 01:00:10,280
sure you can borrow it,
but I need it back.

966
01:00:11,090 --> 01:00:12,710
And I started to give it back
to me in two or three days.

967
01:00:12,711 --> 01:00:16,880
So several days passed and I asked Ryan
about the book and he hemmed and hawed

968
01:00:16,881 --> 01:00:20,680
and a week later, where's the
book? And he wouldn't respond,

969
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:24,380
sort of looking at me in the eye
and I always a good sign. Yeah.

970
01:00:25,390 --> 01:00:27,770
So I go, where's my book? And
remember my, my is booking though.

971
01:00:28,190 --> 01:00:31,430
Then two weeks at my vagina, not
pressuring me, Paul, I need that textbook,

972
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:34,590
you know, as part of the
class stuff, I finally got,

973
01:00:34,591 --> 01:00:37,850
I had got a hold of Ryan and I said,
where is my brother's book?

974
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:43,190
And my Ryan said, Paul, I can't
give it back to, and I said, why?

975
01:00:44,150 --> 01:00:46,160
So my dad found it and burned it.

976
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:53,690
I said,
your dad burned my brother's book,

977
01:00:55,640 --> 01:01:00,470
what? He goes, yeah, it was center
to be counterculture and threatening,

978
01:01:00,471 --> 01:01:05,400
you know, to our family, you know,
structure or not. I could not believe it.

979
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:09,680
I was so upset and I was so apologetic
to my brother who did not take it well,

980
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:13,950
you know, like last time I'm going
to trust you. They see you then.

981
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:18,630
So I was really bad and so, so,
but I thought to myself, you know,

982
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:23,700
if this was so disturbing to
this Alpha Male, you know,

983
01:01:23,730 --> 01:01:25,820
conservative,
you know,

984
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:29,930
neo-con like personality than I think I
found the subject I'm going to explore

985
01:01:29,931 --> 01:01:33,740
more. So that got me into,
into magic mushrooms and um,

986
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:38,480
from my experience and also tremendous
amount of guilt for my brother trusted me,

987
01:01:38,481 --> 01:01:40,640
but there's textbook and I
couldn't return it to him.

988
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:46,010
So John was really interested
in this subject. He inspired me.

989
01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:48,380
And then John went on to chemistry,

990
01:01:48,381 --> 01:01:52,280
then neurophysiology and University
of Washington medical school on full

991
01:01:52,281 --> 01:01:55,060
scholarship.
And I was left in the laboratory.

992
01:01:55,150 --> 01:01:57,950
And so I started
experimenting with marijuana.

993
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:00,410
I remember the DEA came
to Columbia in Ohio.

994
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:03,260
They had a whole display of drugs and
a whole bunch of me and my friends just

995
01:02:03,261 --> 01:02:05,210
went there to look at them.
Wow. Wow. Look at that one.

996
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:10,700
How old were you at the time? 14. 15
years of age. I mean, drugs on display,

997
01:02:10,701 --> 01:02:14,960
drugs you've heard about, you've never
seen. Huh? Look how small that LSC is.

998
01:02:14,961 --> 01:02:15,794
That's incredible.

999
01:02:16,460 --> 01:02:21,460
So I still had this really bad stuttering
habit and it was really socially the

1000
01:02:21,871 --> 01:02:24,480
ability dating, um, on multiple levels.

1001
01:02:24,481 --> 01:02:26,970
And so I ended up,

1002
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:31,870
and I was in Ohio and I ended up buying
a bag of magic mushrooms and I've never

1003
01:02:32,610 --> 01:02:33,610
really into the drug scene,

1004
01:02:33,611 --> 01:02:36,120
so I don't know if I know how
much things should cost, you know?

1005
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:39,510
So for 20 bucks I bought a bag and I just,

1006
01:02:39,570 --> 01:02:41,130
I knew set and setting
was really important,

1007
01:02:41,131 --> 01:02:44,600
but I had no guide and nobody else
in my little circle was into it.

1008
01:02:44,601 --> 01:02:48,510
And so there was a really great walk
that I would like to walk in the woods up

1009
01:02:48,511 --> 01:02:52,230
on the hills and beautiful rolling
hills and Ohio, northern Ohio. And,

1010
01:02:52,950 --> 01:02:56,590
and I thought, okay, sentence I think
is important. So I took the bag and,

1011
01:02:57,270 --> 01:02:59,850
and um,
I thought that would be one dose

1012
01:03:02,270 --> 01:03:03,750
was not one of those folks.

1013
01:03:04,590 --> 01:03:08,920
I probably ate about 20 grams
of a slice of events. US.

1014
01:03:08,930 --> 01:03:11,400
Now in defense of this,

1015
01:03:11,401 --> 01:03:15,150
I need to make it clear that these were
not grown and these were harvested and

1016
01:03:15,151 --> 01:03:16,470
so there were exposed to the sun.

1017
01:03:16,471 --> 01:03:19,800
So they may have been on the equivalent
to like 10 grounds of cubensis for

1018
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:22,020
people who are listening,
five grams, that's lots of,

1019
01:03:22,021 --> 01:03:25,230
he commences to the hero's journey
and you know, you're full blown.

1020
01:03:25,590 --> 01:03:28,950
You're into star scape,
you're changing dimensions,

1021
01:03:28,951 --> 01:03:30,780
you're fractal patterns.

1022
01:03:30,781 --> 01:03:35,781
The error becomes a sea of mathematical
formulas and your mind is opened up.

1023
01:03:36,781 --> 01:03:39,420
Your hearts opened up your feel
one with the universe. That's the,

1024
01:03:39,450 --> 01:03:41,510
that's the hero's journey.
That's five grams. You know,

1025
01:03:41,710 --> 01:03:44,430
you don't get that until it
was going over three grams.

1026
01:03:44,431 --> 01:03:47,260
She started getting into it.
But so 10 to 20 grams is,

1027
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:51,840
is the super hero's journey. I've never
eaten these before. And so I walked,

1028
01:03:51,930 --> 01:03:54,390
I was walking into this
place about an hour walk.

1029
01:03:54,391 --> 01:03:58,980
I started consuming them and
drinking water because they
were dried. And then, um,

1030
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:03,480
I saw a tree that I love climbing
and this tree had his limb,

1031
01:04:03,481 --> 01:04:06,390
so it was a perfect climbing tree
and at the very top of the hill.

1032
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:11,160
So I thought that's a great place. I mean
set and setting a, getting a good view.

1033
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:14,100
That's what I need and I could
feel the mushrooms coming on and I,

1034
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:18,450
as I climbed up the tree, you
know, stem branch by branch,

1035
01:04:18,451 --> 01:04:22,770
I got higher and higher. So it was
kind of a ascending euphoria, you know,

1036
01:04:22,771 --> 01:04:25,770
that kind of kind of went with everything.
It was very cool.

1037
01:04:25,771 --> 01:04:29,960
And I got to the top of the tree and
beautiful landscape and I'm up there and

1038
01:04:29,961 --> 01:04:32,930
then just the mushrooms are coming on
and getting higher and higher. And,

1039
01:04:33,460 --> 01:04:38,190
and I've realized when I'm really
getting high here and a little dizzying,

1040
01:04:38,220 --> 01:04:41,390
so I'm holding onto the
tree and on the horizon.

1041
01:04:41,391 --> 01:04:46,320
But this being Black Bank of boiling dark,
angry clouds,

1042
01:04:46,590 --> 01:04:48,600
it was a summer storm coming in.
And Ohio,

1043
01:04:48,601 --> 01:04:51,240
when you see the summer storms are hurt,
they're terrifying.

1044
01:04:51,870 --> 01:04:55,650
They're lightening bolts coming down and
thunder and lightening there was off in

1045
01:04:55,651 --> 01:04:57,570
the distance,
but it was coming at me really quickly.

1046
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:00,260
But I'm getting higher and
higher as a thunderstorm.

1047
01:05:00,330 --> 01:05:04,080
Lightning storms coming closer and closer.
I'm getting vertigo and I'd go,

1048
01:05:04,081 --> 01:05:06,750
oh my God, I, you know, I can't get
off the tree. I don't want to fall.

1049
01:05:06,751 --> 01:05:08,610
It's like held on the tree for dear life.

1050
01:05:08,611 --> 01:05:13,000
And it became my axis Mundi sort of my
access to write into the earth and I just

1051
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:17,800
an amazing experience. I mean,
just beautiful experience,

1052
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:21,700
but also the threat of lightning coming
closer and closer and every lightning

1053
01:05:21,701 --> 01:05:22,950
strike it would hit them,

1054
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:27,220
be fractal patterns would just emanate
out from every lightning striking.

1055
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:31,800
This is a synesthesia occurred, you
know, where there, you know, uh,

1056
01:05:32,230 --> 01:05:36,730
it sound and, and, and, and
visions were merging together and,

1057
01:05:37,090 --> 01:05:40,270
and um, it sounds, had visions
and visions that sounds,

1058
01:05:40,271 --> 01:05:44,640
and it was just an incredibly
complex, you know, the,

1059
01:05:44,641 --> 01:05:48,260
one of my favorite books are the
glass bead game by, by Hermann Hessa.

1060
01:05:48,730 --> 01:05:52,930
I'll also called a master
Ludy and some other area died.

1061
01:05:52,931 --> 01:05:56,290
He got the Nobel prize for
it in 1955. Um, but that,

1062
01:05:56,291 --> 01:05:58,540
that was a deep dive into,

1063
01:05:59,050 --> 01:06:01,510
into inner space exploration.

1064
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:05,200
But I felt like I was part of the
glass bead game and I, there I was,

1065
01:06:05,201 --> 01:06:07,730
I was descending into this higher state
of consciousness and then I realize,

1066
01:06:07,731 --> 01:06:08,564
oh my God,

1067
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:13,590
I'm in the highest point in
miles during a lightning storm.

1068
01:06:14,890 --> 01:06:19,110
This is not a good place to be.
And uh,

1069
01:06:19,630 --> 01:06:20,680
and then I was up there,

1070
01:06:20,681 --> 01:06:23,440
I was terrified and the lightning storm
came closer and closer and I had these

1071
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:28,750
can pathogenic, you know, just empathy
for the universe one, everything is fine.

1072
01:06:28,751 --> 01:06:32,680
If I die here today,
my life is complete now I understand.

1073
01:06:32,710 --> 01:06:35,740
I'm part of the fabric of all
the matter that surround me.

1074
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:39,400
I'm one with everything
I made of stardust.

1075
01:06:39,401 --> 01:06:43,690
Everything's made us start us. This is
a continuum of nature. Death is natural,

1076
01:06:43,691 --> 01:06:48,040
birth is natural transitions or,
or just the way of way of existence.

1077
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:51,640
And then the lightning
storm and the wind came up.

1078
01:06:51,641 --> 01:06:55,660
I'm washed with warm rain
and it was just terrifying.

1079
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:58,990
A lightning storm and I that meant
that there. And I'm thinking, Oh,

1080
01:06:59,050 --> 01:07:01,510
I'm going to die, but
if I don't die, Paul,

1081
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:06,340
what are you going to learn from this
experience? Challenge yourself right now.

1082
01:07:06,370 --> 01:07:10,030
This is all great and wonderful,
but let's get down to brass tacks.

1083
01:07:10,990 --> 01:07:14,560
What's your biggest issues? You're not
going to die? What's your biggest issue?

1084
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:17,560
I stuttering.
So I'm having this dialogue with myself.

1085
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:22,120
I just can't overcome this stuttering
habit, you know, I'm not stupid.

1086
01:07:22,121 --> 01:07:25,570
And I went to for people to
understand how bad it was,

1087
01:07:26,410 --> 01:07:31,300
I was interviewed for special education
because of my stuttering because I

1088
01:07:31,301 --> 01:07:35,610
couldn't read in class. And so
when it's my turn to read, I, I,

1089
01:07:35,620 --> 01:07:39,580
they would pass on me because no one
had the patience to hear a stutterer and

1090
01:07:39,581 --> 01:07:44,440
please don't finish a or a sentence.
Look at them, smile and engage.

1091
01:07:45,130 --> 01:07:48,610
Help them finish their sentence,
don't finish it for them.

1092
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:54,240
That robs them of the opportunity
of overcoming this speech deficits.

1093
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:55,833
Um,

1094
01:07:55,930 --> 01:08:00,100
so I scored high on my test,

1095
01:08:00,101 --> 01:08:01,660
so I didn't get it put
into special education,

1096
01:08:01,661 --> 01:08:05,920
but it was a pretty demoralizing to
realize I'm going to go in to the special

1097
01:08:05,921 --> 01:08:10,420
education class. Um, but I didn't.
So I thought stuttering is my issue.

1098
01:08:10,630 --> 01:08:15,290
And so I started saying to myself, Paul,
stop stuttering now. You can do this.

1099
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:19,610
You're not stupid in it. Come from a
very smart family. You have, you know,

1100
01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:25,370
you can do this. And so I
said, stop stuttering now
over and over and over again.

1101
01:08:25,430 --> 01:08:30,170
Hundreds if not thousands of times,
and there's storm washed over me.

1102
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:34,400
I felt like I achieved a state of godhead.
I felt enlightened.

1103
01:08:34,970 --> 01:08:39,620
I come from a Christian background.
So I had this empathic empathy with Jesus.

1104
01:08:39,621 --> 01:08:42,250
You know, and now you understand
why Jesus went into wilderness.

1105
01:08:42,460 --> 01:08:45,410
And I don't understand why Jesus said,
don't go into churches,

1106
01:08:45,411 --> 01:08:49,190
go in the nature or whatever. You
know, that's my cultural background.

1107
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:53,720
But I saw it, I connected on that
level and I realized, oh my gosh,

1108
01:08:53,721 --> 01:08:56,840
this is something that I can overcome.
So I came out of the tree,

1109
01:08:57,350 --> 01:09:01,100
obviously did not get
electric and went back home.

1110
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:06,400
And then the next morning there's this
girl that I greatly admired and she was

1111
01:09:06,441 --> 01:09:11,441
super sweet and nice to me and I really
love her to this day because of her

1112
01:09:11,601 --> 01:09:13,730
kindness. Um, and,

1113
01:09:13,820 --> 01:09:17,420
and I didn't want to talk to
her because every time I talk

1114
01:09:19,190 --> 01:09:22,940
I,
you know,

1115
01:09:22,941 --> 01:09:25,430
and then you get these half breaths going
on and then you can't get out of this

1116
01:09:25,431 --> 01:09:26,930
loop. And, um,

1117
01:09:26,990 --> 01:09:31,990
she's coming on the sidewalk and in the
morning and she looks at me and she's so

1118
01:09:32,151 --> 01:09:34,160
sweet. He said, good
morning Paul, how are you?

1119
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:39,350
And I cast my eyes up from the sidewalk
and I looked at her and I said,

1120
01:09:39,620 --> 01:09:42,590
I'm doing fine,
thank you for asking.

1121
01:09:43,790 --> 01:09:48,380
And I stopped stuttering just like that.
Now I do have,

1122
01:09:48,410 --> 01:09:51,400
I've had about four or five
relapses, you know, um,

1123
01:09:52,310 --> 01:09:55,820
if that's a lot of noise and I've
been drinking and somebody asks me,

1124
01:09:55,940 --> 01:09:59,000
how do you grow mushrooms? It's like
filling a well with a teaspoon. I like,

1125
01:09:59,060 --> 01:10:01,660
where do I begin? You know, like so,

1126
01:10:01,940 --> 01:10:04,980
or if I mean somebody super famous or
something like that, you know, it's,

1127
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:09,200
but that's natural. You know, people get
stage fright, um, when they're, you know,

1128
01:10:09,201 --> 01:10:09,920
and so,

1129
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:14,920
but if it's something that I think is
really important because there's one other

1130
01:10:15,111 --> 01:10:20,111
aspect there's related to hearing that
I want to mention and I have a really

1131
01:10:20,511 --> 01:10:23,410
good friend,
he just passed on now named Bill Webb.

1132
01:10:23,411 --> 01:10:28,411
He lived in big Sur California and I
was 19 years old when I wrote my first

1133
01:10:29,511 --> 01:10:33,520
book, Salafi mushrooms and their
allies. I was self-trained,

1134
01:10:33,700 --> 01:10:36,740
I got involved in University of
Washington with Dr. Daniel Stones,

1135
01:10:36,770 --> 01:10:38,540
part of a taxonomic key council.

1136
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:43,580
And I adopted the taxonomy of psilocybin
mushrooms as my special reality.

1137
01:10:44,060 --> 01:10:46,130
Yeah. That the time, there's
very little literature on it.

1138
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:48,220
Most of the books in
libraries have been raised.

1139
01:10:48,530 --> 01:10:52,280
The pages had been raised it out.
Doctor students had an intact library,

1140
01:10:52,281 --> 01:10:54,330
so I could study with them.
I became a taxonomist.

1141
01:10:55,130 --> 01:10:58,100
I wrote talks about Mickey's
starting when I was 19 or 20.

1142
01:10:58,190 --> 01:11:03,110
And that became the core of my book.
So I'm uh,

1143
01:11:03,140 --> 01:11:08,140
have this manuscript and I go to Montana
books in Seattle to pitch the book and

1144
01:11:08,391 --> 01:11:09,860
Montana books is pretty soon some,

1145
01:11:10,110 --> 01:11:13,100
some gay friendly literature and
they were on the cutting edge.

1146
01:11:13,620 --> 01:11:16,710
I was recommended that I see them.
And so I made an appointment,

1147
01:11:16,711 --> 01:11:20,430
I go up to Seattle and I'm in a meeting,
the head of Montana books and he goes,

1148
01:11:20,431 --> 01:11:24,300
you know, this is not, our
market is an interesting subject.

1149
01:11:24,690 --> 01:11:29,160
Really what you need is a book agent and
it goes to the best book agent I know.

1150
01:11:29,220 --> 01:11:31,680
Cause Bill Webb and I haven't
seen him in two years.

1151
01:11:32,370 --> 01:11:34,980
And at the sounds of those words,

1152
01:11:35,580 --> 01:11:40,170
a little bell jingles on the front
door of Montana books in walks,

1153
01:11:40,171 --> 01:11:43,750
Bill Webb and the publisher one.
No.

1154
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:49,790
So bill and I became tight friends,
invited me down to big Sur.

1155
01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:55,620
He was a friend, uh, of,
uh, of uh, Henry Miller, um,

1156
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:56,820
and um,

1157
01:11:57,120 --> 01:12:01,950
and just a really fantastic individually
become a father figure to me at a

1158
01:12:01,951 --> 01:12:06,510
really critical time in my life.
And so bill and I did journeys together,

1159
01:12:06,770 --> 01:12:11,610
you know, sacred journeys
without any alibi. Obi wan
Kenobi. You're realize I'm 19,

1160
01:12:11,611 --> 01:12:14,970
20 years old of age. I'm
with a 75 year old, you know,

1161
01:12:14,971 --> 01:12:19,900
who is a friend of Ansell Adams. He
had Ansell, Adams Library of, of uh,

1162
01:12:19,950 --> 01:12:23,850
of many of his implants and working
with his wife and curating them.

1163
01:12:23,851 --> 01:12:28,080
I mean really cultured intellectually
interesting guy, beautiful place.

1164
01:12:28,530 --> 01:12:33,150
And so bill and I tripped several times
and it was a wonderful experience for me

1165
01:12:33,540 --> 01:12:38,310
and it brings tears to my eyes
is talking about bill. So bill,

1166
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:43,340
he died about 15 years ago and bill
calls me up about three or four months

1167
01:12:44,791 --> 01:12:49,110
before he dies and he goes, Paul, I for
telling you something that's so important.

1168
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:52,140
I'm jealous. I haven't heard from you
in years. How's it going? He goes, well,

1169
01:12:52,141 --> 01:12:56,670
frankly, life socks. I've lost losing
my sight. I'm losing my hearing.

1170
01:12:57,210 --> 01:12:58,260
I can't hear the waves.

1171
01:12:58,261 --> 01:13:02,400
So this equals now I live above the
cliffs of big Sur except for this damn

1172
01:13:02,401 --> 01:13:06,090
hearing aid, which has always
malfunctioning. They say, I hate it,

1173
01:13:06,091 --> 01:13:09,960
but I've got to tell you something. It's
so important that you know, I go, okay,

1174
01:13:09,961 --> 01:13:13,980
Bill. And I said, what is it? Bill goes,
no, I really want you to listen, Paul.

1175
01:13:13,981 --> 01:13:16,890
This is important, Bill. I understand.

1176
01:13:17,130 --> 01:13:18,900
And then he kind of kept
on emphasizing ends.

1177
01:13:18,901 --> 01:13:21,420
And finally I got frustrated and
bill, I got the message, okay,

1178
01:13:21,570 --> 01:13:22,380
I know what you're gonna tell me.

1179
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:26,070
It's important because I want to
make sure that you tell other people,

1180
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:29,910
will you promise me? And I go,
I promise you. He said, Paul,

1181
01:13:29,970 --> 01:13:34,410
I think I found something medically very
important about Saul Simon. I go, what?

1182
01:13:35,050 --> 01:13:38,430
He said, well, you don't run on the
hero's journey. I was, you know,

1183
01:13:38,431 --> 01:13:41,780
took out my hearing aid.
I'm laying, you know,

1184
01:13:41,790 --> 01:13:44,490
in full bliss and one with the universe.
You know,

1185
01:13:44,491 --> 01:13:49,491
he's like 80 years age or 82 years of age
when he was doing this by himself as I

1186
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:52,980
know. I could hear the seagulls, I can
hear the waves. I know, oh my gosh,

1187
01:13:52,981 --> 01:13:56,340
I can hear everything. And he reached for
his hearing aid. He didn't have it in.

1188
01:13:56,550 --> 01:14:01,410
And he goes, oh my gosh, I can here. And
then he heard this, click, click, click,

1189
01:14:01,411 --> 01:14:06,010
click, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap. He looked
around going, that's, that's weird.

1190
01:14:06,011 --> 01:14:09,700
It doesn't unusual sound and pick, click,
click, click, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap,

1191
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:13,570
click like. And he goes, he couldn't
figure out what it was. He looked around,

1192
01:14:13,571 --> 01:14:15,940
he looked around and
finally he saw what it was.

1193
01:14:16,330 --> 01:14:20,440
There are ants walking on the deck
and it was hearing their footsteps.

1194
01:14:21,310 --> 01:14:25,960
That is wild. Now this is where even
I, and I'm a liberal kind of guy,

1195
01:14:25,990 --> 01:14:30,870
I'm like, wait a second, you know,
tell me that again. You know,

1196
01:14:31,170 --> 01:14:35,300
and that's why bill set me up by saying
you have to tell other people this.

1197
01:14:35,700 --> 01:14:37,110
So I'm in work working with youth,

1198
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:40,340
with Roland Griffiths at Johns
Johns Hopkins University,

1199
01:14:40,380 --> 01:14:41,520
the clinical studies on Psilocybin,

1200
01:14:41,590 --> 01:14:46,470
etc. And I am really emphasize this to
the many of the researchers they could

1201
01:14:46,530 --> 01:14:51,120
easily do attached, you know, why
these patients are in session, uh,

1202
01:14:51,150 --> 01:14:54,600
to test their hearing.
Is He,

1203
01:14:54,601 --> 01:14:58,770
if they have increased sensitivity,
increased range, tonal ranges,

1204
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:00,510
is it very easy metric?

1205
01:15:01,380 --> 01:15:06,330
But I think what happened with me on the
tree and the lightening storm is that I

1206
01:15:06,331 --> 01:15:11,331
created a new neurological pathway of
articulating my thoughts and overcoming

1207
01:15:13,381 --> 01:15:15,000
this social phobia.

1208
01:15:15,270 --> 01:15:19,470
The social phobia is a trigger is
definitely an environmental trigger.

1209
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:24,660
And then we get locked into these
loops that are really, really strange.

1210
01:15:25,260 --> 01:15:30,260
Another good thing to tell a study room
is can you demonstrate different ways of

1211
01:15:30,361 --> 01:15:31,890
stuttering?
They'll do it.

1212
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:36,450
You want me to start her
different ways of stuttering?

1213
01:15:36,690 --> 01:15:40,470
I'll give you three different ways and
stuttering and it is so it's really weird

1214
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:45,060
because that act as a pattern interrupt
that helps them to overcome at least

1215
01:15:45,061 --> 01:15:48,940
temporarily the stuttering or is it just
a useful for a nonstarter order here,

1216
01:15:49,020 --> 01:15:50,040
different ways of stuttering.

1217
01:15:51,610 --> 01:15:52,443
Hmm.

1218
01:15:52,990 --> 01:15:55,780
I haven't thought of that. That's,
I'm not sure how to answer that,

1219
01:15:56,110 --> 01:16:01,110
but I do think that once a new
neurological pathways are established,

1220
01:16:02,470 --> 01:16:03,900
you can capitalize on them.

1221
01:16:04,510 --> 01:16:04,850
Okay,

1222
01:16:04,850 --> 01:16:06,560
bye.
Were you remembering them?

1223
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:09,080
And this is the thing that
John Hopkins University,

1224
01:16:09,090 --> 01:16:14,090
some of the most surprising results is
14 months after these experiences when

1225
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:17,570
many of the patients said there was the
most important spiritual experiences of

1226
01:16:17,571 --> 01:16:20,840
our lives.
14 months afterwards.

1227
01:16:20,870 --> 01:16:24,980
Not only they have demonstrated
will benefits being nicer,

1228
01:16:24,981 --> 01:16:28,430
people being a better parent,
a better husband,

1229
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:30,440
socially more well adopted.

1230
01:16:31,220 --> 01:16:36,220
But the fact that they reremembered the
experience re enforced those benefits

1231
01:16:39,050 --> 01:16:41,930
that they experienced
directly after the experience.

1232
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:45,770
So a lot of people,
people are listening may not understand,

1233
01:16:45,771 --> 01:16:49,560
these are not drugs of abuse. You eat
these mushrooms one day, the next day,

1234
01:16:49,570 --> 01:16:52,370
you'll no way.
I'm mark one near those things.

1235
01:16:52,790 --> 01:16:55,190
You look at them and you've got
the repellency property, right?

1236
01:16:55,191 --> 01:16:58,340
The psilocybin repellency property.
Like I'm not talking about it for months,

1237
01:16:58,580 --> 01:17:00,500
but boy, that was a great
experience. You know,

1238
01:17:00,501 --> 01:17:02,690
so these are not substances of abuse,

1239
01:17:03,050 --> 01:17:07,850
but there are shockingly powerful to
the point that you're not ready for the

1240
01:17:07,851 --> 01:17:09,890
hero's journey for a long time.

1241
01:17:10,490 --> 01:17:13,520
So these are not drugs of abuse
by any stretch of the imagination.

1242
01:17:13,820 --> 01:17:16,730
They really should be recategorized
as a therapeutic drug.

1243
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:21,960
Definitely. Uh, and this, this
in many ways relates to your,

1244
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:22,890
well,

1245
01:17:22,890 --> 01:17:27,890
it relates to a few of your previous
stories very well in so much as a silicide

1246
01:17:29,271 --> 01:17:34,271
is very challenging as a medical model in,

1247
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:38,610
in several respects, one of which
is that it does not require, say,

1248
01:17:38,611 --> 01:17:40,200
daily or weekly administration.

1249
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:45,920
And it is economically difficult to
create a for profit model unless you are

1250
01:17:48,901 --> 01:17:53,901
monetizing a therapy and adjunct pre and
post support and things of that type a

1251
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:56,970
but not in the,

1252
01:17:57,420 --> 01:18:01,710
the sort of one and done or three times
and done aspect of it actually makes it

1253
01:18:01,711 --> 01:18:06,510
very challenging to commercialize and
make widespread unless you're relating on,

1254
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:09,840
uh, or relying on
donations. Excuse me. Uh,

1255
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:13,770
I would love to hear your thoughts.
Just to expand on this a little bit.

1256
01:18:14,660 --> 01:18:15,840
Do you think,

1257
01:18:16,590 --> 01:18:20,700
say psilocybin or another that I know
very little about but wanted to discuss

1258
01:18:20,701 --> 01:18:24,720
with you, but we can talk about
both or either say lion's Mane,

1259
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:27,540
are there in this case,

1260
01:18:27,541 --> 01:18:31,140
should I say mushrooms or should
I say my psyllium or my Cilia?

1261
01:18:31,170 --> 01:18:35,040
What would be the right way to art and
we won't be the right term to use here?

1262
01:18:35,380 --> 01:18:39,310
Well, yeah, the

1263
01:18:39,310 --> 01:18:40,900
mushrooms are like white people know,

1264
01:18:41,790 --> 01:18:46,790
is it emerging as a tremendously important
reservoir of many bioactive molecules

1265
01:18:48,971 --> 01:18:51,400
that are supersede the
benefit of mushrooms,

1266
01:18:51,401 --> 01:18:56,320
25 and whole genome sequencing of
a Reishi mushrooms and the genus.

1267
01:18:56,750 --> 01:18:59,830
Again, a Dharma, um, uh, these, uh,

1268
01:18:59,831 --> 01:19:04,831
the common links link g lyncher a
ratio of men and talking 10,000 year a

1269
01:19:05,111 --> 01:19:09,360
mushroom, the mushroom of
immortality. These are all
common names out of Asia. Um,

1270
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:14,720
they're 25% more genes are active and
expressed and the mycelial form than it

1271
01:19:15,431 --> 01:19:15,671
is.

1272
01:19:15,671 --> 01:19:19,000
And the fruit body form that they fruit
buys a mushroom form as the end of its

1273
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:19,873
lifecycle.

1274
01:19:20,050 --> 01:19:25,050
So much of our research as found going
side by side comparisons of mushrooms,

1275
01:19:25,421 --> 01:19:29,160
which are protein rich, uh,
they're a Beta Glucan, a rich,

1276
01:19:29,161 --> 01:19:31,750
they have lots of carbohydrates
and then polysaccharides,

1277
01:19:32,050 --> 01:19:35,830
they're nutritionally dense.
But the mycelium is,

1278
01:19:35,890 --> 01:19:40,570
is articulating constantly I
bio shield of defense and uh,

1279
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:44,520
if I'm the exposure when the mushrooms
form good luck to any bacteria and it's

1280
01:19:44,521 --> 01:19:45,520
going to rot it.
It's got to,

1281
01:19:45,570 --> 01:19:48,700
it's got to spoilating four or five
days and then gives himself up anyhow.

1282
01:19:48,940 --> 01:19:49,540
Moreover,

1283
01:19:49,540 --> 01:19:54,040
I think that the sequence of bacteria
that rots mushrooms is absolutely

1284
01:19:54,041 --> 01:19:55,630
instrumentally and uh,

1285
01:19:55,631 --> 01:19:59,250
important for the evolution of the
ecosystem that give rise to the trees that

1286
01:19:59,251 --> 01:20:00,850
create the debris fields
that feed the mycelium.

1287
01:20:01,060 --> 01:20:05,920
So these are deterministic
microbiomes and the micro biome,

1288
01:20:05,950 --> 01:20:08,040
the,
the fungal is determining

1289
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:11,850
the micro biome because many of these
bacteria are adversarial and some of our

1290
01:20:11,851 --> 01:20:14,400
commensal somewhere actually
mutualistic beneficial.

1291
01:20:14,730 --> 01:20:19,200
So that mycelium is this articulation
of this network that because of EPA

1292
01:20:19,201 --> 01:20:19,741
genesis,

1293
01:20:19,741 --> 01:20:24,300
the ability to respond to environmental
stimuli and upregulate and express nude

1294
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:28,360
and gene expressions, it is
a fertile ground for, uh,

1295
01:20:28,530 --> 01:20:32,850
learning for being able to articulate
a responses as new challenges and the

1296
01:20:32,851 --> 01:20:37,170
environment, the mushroom fruit body is
at the end of the thing. But you know,

1297
01:20:37,230 --> 01:20:42,230
people are attracted to mushrooms and
they fear that typically nature of that,

1298
01:20:43,141 --> 01:20:44,040
which is a femoral.

1299
01:20:44,460 --> 01:20:49,460
Now we're around trees and around
dogs and animals and plants for weeks,

1300
01:20:49,771 --> 01:20:50,604
months,
years.

1301
01:20:50,730 --> 01:20:55,730
So the familiar either factor of constant
exposure day to day gives us some

1302
01:20:55,951 --> 01:20:59,340
confidence and oh that animal
is not going to attack me.

1303
01:20:59,341 --> 01:21:03,960
Or that plant is one that my answers have
been using and, and we understand it,

1304
01:21:04,230 --> 01:21:08,070
but mushrooms that come up and disappear
in four or five days, some can feed you,

1305
01:21:08,250 --> 01:21:10,650
some can kill you,
some can heal you,

1306
01:21:10,651 --> 01:21:13,920
some can send you on a psychoactive
journey that which is so powerful,

1307
01:21:13,921 --> 01:21:16,680
but so ephemeral is naturally
to be afraid of them.

1308
01:21:17,340 --> 01:21:22,290
So we have about 200 species
of mushrooms that are edible,

1309
01:21:22,291 --> 01:21:24,750
medicinal. I don't know the difference
between edible and medicinal anymore.

1310
01:21:25,050 --> 01:21:27,750
I'm all edible.
Mushrooms have medicinal properties,

1311
01:21:28,170 --> 01:21:33,000
but the mycelium expresses a lot more of
these compounds. And with lion's Mane,

1312
01:21:33,340 --> 01:21:35,550
there's a group of uh,
Aaron Ne Scenes.

1313
01:21:35,820 --> 01:21:39,090
Now the lion's mane mushroom is
called Harris Iom. Erinaceous.

1314
01:21:39,150 --> 01:21:40,240
That's the Latin binomial.
Yeah.

1315
01:21:40,280 --> 01:21:41,130
Paul,
I don't interrupt,

1316
01:21:41,131 --> 01:21:44,130
but I just want to pause for one second
to plant a seed and we can come back to

1317
01:21:44,131 --> 01:21:46,110
it or spore and come back to it later,

1318
01:21:46,111 --> 01:21:50,850
which is potential applications
to neurodegenerative
diseases like Alzheimer's

1319
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:52,620
or Parkinson's.
But I don't want to interrupt.

1320
01:21:52,621 --> 01:21:55,380
I just want to plant that seed
so that I don't forget it myself.

1321
01:21:55,740 --> 01:21:57,060
So please continue.

1322
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:01,470
So the [inaudible] are some of the
strongest and nerve growth factor is ever

1323
01:22:01,471 --> 01:22:03,180
discovered by science.

1324
01:22:03,690 --> 01:22:08,690
Ngf factors are called neuroco factors
and they regenerate Myelin on the axons

1325
01:22:09,091 --> 01:22:13,500
of nerves. So now lion's
mane is perfectly legal. Um,

1326
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:17,310
it has a long history of use, multi
thousands of years. History of you.

1327
01:22:17,311 --> 01:22:21,360
It looks like a, a casket. It looks like
pom poms that cheerleaders shoes. Yes,

1328
01:22:21,370 --> 01:22:26,190
a white casket and crystals,
uh, a descending, uh, um,

1329
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:28,230
um, teeth. Um,

1330
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:32,460
and it's a beautifully beautiful mushroom.

1331
01:22:32,461 --> 01:22:35,780
It tastes like shrimp or lobster when you
add butter to it and when you cook it.

1332
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:41,300
But the compounds that are most neuro
generative are from the Mycelium,

1333
01:22:42,780 --> 01:22:43,830
not from the mushrooms.

1334
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:48,780
And so the era ne scenes are from the
Mycelium Harvison knowns are another group

1335
01:22:48,781 --> 01:22:52,740
of Norwest factors there from the
mushrooms, but the [inaudible] is by far,

1336
01:22:52,770 --> 01:22:54,240
much more neuro regenerative.

1337
01:22:55,260 --> 01:22:58,620
There's been several clinical studies
that have come out on mild cognitive

1338
01:22:58,621 --> 01:23:01,530
dysfunction out of Japan.
Um,

1339
01:23:01,590 --> 01:23:05,740
and they are very promising isn't as the,
it's the first smart mushroom wall.

1340
01:23:05,741 --> 01:23:08,800
Silicide mushrooms, maybe the first
smart mushroom in my mind, but, but,

1341
01:23:08,980 --> 01:23:13,300
but lion's mane mushrooms is one
mushroom that I take on a daily basis.

1342
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:15,700
My mother takes it on a daily basis.

1343
01:23:15,701 --> 01:23:20,560
She's almost 93 years of age and a
few days. Uh, she's smart as a whip.

1344
01:23:20,561 --> 01:23:23,800
She beat my two brothers and
scrabble and not too long ago,

1345
01:23:24,310 --> 01:23:25,960
which was a lot of fun.
I went really,

1346
01:23:26,260 --> 01:23:28,940
I told them my brother's mom
beat you is gravel, you know,

1347
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:32,930
and my twin brother go low. You
know, she got lucky and I go, oh,

1348
01:23:32,950 --> 01:23:35,420
that was a clean wind then who? My
brother was very defensive. But,

1349
01:23:35,670 --> 01:23:36,503
but nevertheless,
my,

1350
01:23:36,940 --> 01:23:41,290
the lion's Mane Mushrooms I
think are extremely helpful,

1351
01:23:41,710 --> 01:23:44,590
uh, to for rent, neuropathies.

1352
01:23:44,740 --> 01:23:47,290
And I think stacking them with silicide.

1353
01:23:47,390 --> 01:23:52,390
And something I'm really keen on is doing
microdosing of psilocybin stacked with

1354
01:23:53,501 --> 01:23:56,500
lion's mane,
the lion's mane in and of itself.

1355
01:23:56,530 --> 01:24:00,820
We know as neuro regenerative
properties is a big subject of research.

1356
01:24:00,900 --> 01:24:04,030
If you go to pub med or Google
scholar alerts, you know,

1357
01:24:04,031 --> 01:24:09,031
put in lion's Mane and neuro regeneration
or an NGF factors and you'll,

1358
01:24:09,641 --> 01:24:10,000
you'll,

1359
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:14,980
there's several dozen peer reviewed
articles extensively exploring the

1360
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:17,350
regeneration of Myelin,

1361
01:24:17,351 --> 01:24:20,830
which is the conductive sheath on the
axons of nerves and those where I gets

1362
01:24:20,831 --> 01:24:22,210
Alzheimer's if for instance,

1363
01:24:22,211 --> 01:24:26,830
have amyloid plaque formation
that interrupts in the roads,

1364
01:24:26,831 --> 01:24:29,560
the Myelin sheath prevents
neurotransmission.

1365
01:24:30,250 --> 01:24:34,150
And so lion's mane mushrooms
have been demonstrated, uh,

1366
01:24:34,180 --> 01:24:38,950
behaviorally and people with
cognitive tests, but also,

1367
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:43,800
um, through a dissection of mice, uh,

1368
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:46,180
prior to using lion's mane,

1369
01:24:46,300 --> 01:24:50,320
they would inject these mice with a
polypeptide that induces amyloid plaque

1370
01:24:50,321 --> 01:24:55,000
formation. It's a very, very potent
toxin. There's neuro neurotoxic,

1371
01:24:55,540 --> 01:24:56,710
but mix out of the,

1372
01:24:56,711 --> 01:24:59,710
what happens to the nervous system of
Alzheimer's patients because amyloid

1373
01:24:59,711 --> 01:25:03,910
plaque formation can be, yeah, it
can conform their behavior changes,

1374
01:25:03,911 --> 01:25:08,050
they lose the ability of the navigating
through mazes. They lose the novelty,

1375
01:25:08,051 --> 01:25:12,190
inquisitive, and in fact factor, the
short term memory is basically erased,

1376
01:25:12,700 --> 01:25:14,320
um, uh, or much of it.

1377
01:25:14,650 --> 01:25:18,160
And then when they've had the lion's
Mane Mushrooms and they dissected,

1378
01:25:18,161 --> 01:25:21,250
doesn't mice and then sure enough they
saw that the amyloid plaque formation was

1379
01:25:21,251 --> 01:25:26,251
there and then there's fully a diseased
mice when they would then feed them

1380
01:25:28,511 --> 01:25:31,060
lion's Mane mushroom for 23 days.

1381
01:25:31,810 --> 01:25:35,290
They regained the ability of
navigating through maize. They,

1382
01:25:35,291 --> 01:25:39,610
we engaged inquisitiveness is
called the novelty, a response,

1383
01:25:39,611 --> 01:25:44,110
then all the tea experiment. Um, and
then upon dissecting those knife, uh,

1384
01:25:44,111 --> 01:25:45,850
and the resections of the tissue,

1385
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:50,220
they could see that the amyloid plaque
had largely resolved [inaudible] nation

1386
01:25:50,260 --> 01:25:53,140
had occurred. And so you
bundle that with, you know,

1387
01:25:53,141 --> 01:25:57,430
you've got to behavior as well as physical
evidence of regeneration of Myelin.

1388
01:25:57,880 --> 01:26:00,310
So lion's mane mushrooms are,
it's just a very,

1389
01:26:00,311 --> 01:26:05,311
very fascinating mushroom I think about
and his last days I think about some of

1390
01:26:05,841 --> 01:26:08,660
my mentors and my collegey
and their very last days,

1391
01:26:08,661 --> 01:26:10,850
we are losing encyclopedic knowledge.

1392
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:15,800
These are mental giants that have so much
to give to the next generation as part

1393
01:26:15,801 --> 01:26:20,270
of our national heritage or intellectual
national heritage. And to lose these,

1394
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:23,840
these geniuses with all this experience,
all this knowledge,

1395
01:26:25,070 --> 01:26:30,070
all this sense of being and contexts to
lose them at the end of their life is us

1396
01:26:32,211 --> 01:26:37,211
losing a library that just as the library
books fall into pieces in your hands.

1397
01:26:37,771 --> 01:26:39,980
And,
and I think it's so important for,

1398
01:26:40,390 --> 01:26:42,290
of our culture is to
preserve that knowledge.

1399
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:44,140
And I think lion's mane
mushroom is a huge one.

1400
01:26:44,970 --> 01:26:49,970
The slow descent into sort
of cognitive malfunction,

1401
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:51,410
uh,
is,

1402
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:56,280
is what I would site when people
ask me what I'm afraid of.

1403
01:26:56,340 --> 01:26:57,510
I mean that that is it.
I mean,

1404
01:26:57,511 --> 01:27:02,430
being trapped in your body without the
cognitive capabilities that you would

1405
01:27:02,431 --> 01:27:05,550
want or need to not just
function but thrive.

1406
01:27:05,790 --> 01:27:07,710
And I completely agree with you.

1407
01:27:08,190 --> 01:27:11,880
This is something I've been fixated on
for quite some time. If you were to,

1408
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:13,793
uh,

1409
01:27:14,670 --> 01:27:19,670
if you were to design a study involving
the microdosing micro administration of

1410
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:24,840
psilocybin under a proper
supervision and uh,

1411
01:27:25,620 --> 01:27:27,660
you know, sort of
researcher controls, what,

1412
01:27:27,870 --> 01:27:29,400
do you have any idea what
that might look like?

1413
01:27:29,580 --> 01:27:30,810
What the protocol might look like?

1414
01:27:32,150 --> 01:27:36,390
Very timely question because in two
hours from now, I have a group of, uh,

1415
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:39,910
uh, of financial people, uh,

1416
01:27:39,990 --> 01:27:44,600
that are key in supporting the current
psilocybin research at Johns Hopkins and

1417
01:27:44,601 --> 01:27:47,250
elsewhere. Uh, they're arriving here, uh,

1418
01:27:47,270 --> 01:27:51,170
specifically and saying with me for
three days to talk about exactly this.

1419
01:27:51,770 --> 01:27:54,830
I had an idea and I'm going
to probably open source this.

1420
01:27:55,130 --> 01:27:59,240
Sometimes I filed patents, I call them
blocking patents. I filed a patent.

1421
01:27:59,330 --> 01:28:02,780
I think she'd be open source in order if
the other people can't get a patent on

1422
01:28:02,781 --> 01:28:05,600
it. And this might be
in that category. Um,

1423
01:28:05,790 --> 01:28:09,110
it's this whole patent
landscape. I'm, I'm, I,

1424
01:28:09,130 --> 01:28:12,830
I see both sides of the arguments of open
sourcing and then also keeping things

1425
01:28:12,831 --> 01:28:16,940
close source.
But I found a patent on neurogenesis.

1426
01:28:16,941 --> 01:28:20,960
You can look it up and stacking
lion's mane, psilocybin and Niacin,

1427
01:28:21,050 --> 01:28:25,880
nicotinic acid. Now, uh, I
spoke before what is patentable.

1428
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:30,740
It is no prior art is speaks
against conventional wisdom. So,

1429
01:28:30,970 --> 01:28:34,050
and when I gave a talk at maps, um, uh,

1430
01:28:34,070 --> 01:28:38,240
recently I asked the
audience about 800 people.

1431
01:28:38,241 --> 01:28:43,160
How many people remember during the
1970s and eighties, it was well known,

1432
01:28:43,190 --> 01:28:44,270
especially on the west coast.

1433
01:28:44,310 --> 01:28:47,690
If you want to come down from a
bad trip on psilocybin or Lsd,

1434
01:28:48,050 --> 01:28:49,250
you could take a bunch of Nice,

1435
01:28:49,251 --> 01:28:53,630
then you'll get a hot flush flush and
people who don't know what may take 500

1436
01:28:53,631 --> 01:28:54,590
milligrams of Niacin.

1437
01:28:54,620 --> 01:28:59,540
You get red and you get tingly all over
your skin and you've got this nice and

1438
01:28:59,541 --> 01:29:04,230
flush and now about 50 people raised
their hands. I actually recorded that.

1439
01:29:04,290 --> 01:29:08,670
I needed that for my patentability because
that was common knowledge that Niacin

1440
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:13,530
counteract the effects of soul side.
I think not number one,

1441
01:29:14,070 --> 01:29:18,210
there's no evidence that that's true,
but it was common knowledge. Number two,

1442
01:29:18,540 --> 01:29:23,540
because it excites the nerve endings and
Rob Kathy's oftentimes occur then the

1443
01:29:24,061 --> 01:29:27,240
deadening of the nerves at
the fingertips and the toes.

1444
01:29:27,810 --> 01:29:30,390
It struck me that if I could
excite the nerve endings,

1445
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:35,130
perhaps I can drive these lion mane
and lion's mane air a scenes and the

1446
01:29:35,131 --> 01:29:40,080
psilocybin to the end points
of the nervous systems if
the vascular system still

1447
01:29:40,081 --> 01:29:44,160
intact to deliver these compounds
to create neurogenesis. Uh,

1448
01:29:44,190 --> 01:29:47,670
and prevent neuropathy, uh, at the
end points of the nervous system.

1449
01:29:48,180 --> 01:29:49,350
So I filed a patent,

1450
01:29:49,380 --> 01:29:53,400
a stacking Niacin
silicide and lion's mane.

1451
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:58,760
This psilocybin a dosage is about one
20th of a gram now that is below the

1452
01:29:59,491 --> 01:30:02,550
threshold of what people would
experience any change in consciousness.

1453
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:06,360
So I know lots of people who would
not dare take us all type of mushroom,

1454
01:30:07,190 --> 01:30:11,700
but the idea of taking one 20th below
threshold dose that would create

1455
01:30:11,701 --> 01:30:16,080
neurogenesis and perhaps make them
cognitively more astute and make them a

1456
01:30:16,081 --> 01:30:19,380
better person. You know,
socially and intellectually.

1457
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:23,100
I knew a lot of people were interested
in that. And plus it's kind of groovy.

1458
01:30:23,101 --> 01:30:26,610
It's kind of sexy.
He's older people say their kids,

1459
01:30:27,080 --> 01:30:29,130
I'm micro dosing, you
know, my go to thing.

1460
01:30:29,160 --> 01:30:32,430
Extremely popular right now as
you probably are well aware,

1461
01:30:32,700 --> 01:30:33,600
but that's something that I,

1462
01:30:33,620 --> 01:30:36,720
that we would like to see a clinical
study now the clinical stuff we already

1463
01:30:36,721 --> 01:30:38,340
know for there,
any conditions out there.

1464
01:30:38,370 --> 01:30:42,120
You have too many variables and you're
in your clinical study and I agree.

1465
01:30:42,390 --> 01:30:46,620
And so we were looking at silicide alone.
That's a lion's mane alone.

1466
01:30:46,650 --> 01:30:49,180
Silicide and stock with,
uh, with lion's mane.

1467
01:30:49,970 --> 01:30:54,930
Niacin will have to come later because
it's just you and you need enough

1468
01:30:55,220 --> 01:30:55,900
cohorts,

1469
01:30:55,900 --> 01:31:00,900
enough people enrolled in the clinical
study in order to have us statistical

1470
01:31:02,971 --> 01:31:07,000
significance almost stuttered
there. Um, uh, so that's,

1471
01:31:07,130 --> 01:31:10,610
that's what we're looking at is
looking at stocking this and,

1472
01:31:10,970 --> 01:31:13,550
and we maybe do this
clinical study in Canada. Uh,

1473
01:31:13,620 --> 01:31:18,050
right now the FDA is very favorable
to the clinical studies. I had a,

1474
01:31:18,330 --> 01:31:22,380
a report from somebody met with the FDA
regulators and they're scientists and

1475
01:31:22,381 --> 01:31:27,360
they said they have never seen
a drug that was so nontoxic,

1476
01:31:28,230 --> 01:31:33,230
so effective from one treatment and the
history of they're looking at approving

1477
01:31:34,770 --> 01:31:38,010
new drugs. Uh, and they were like,

1478
01:31:38,470 --> 01:31:42,060
so the FDA scientists are
quite focused on that.

1479
01:31:42,061 --> 01:31:46,710
And it's something we all in different
between medicine and a toxin. This dose,

1480
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:50,910
I wouldn't call it silicide went of toxin.
Well,

1481
01:31:50,940 --> 01:31:52,560
there's maybe one,

1482
01:31:52,561 --> 01:31:55,590
one funny example that just came out
in the literature of that, but, um,

1483
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:57,210
I wouldn't call it necessarily a toxin,

1484
01:31:57,211 --> 01:32:00,050
but having a sub threshold
dose I think makes a

1485
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:04,480
is it is a really valid approach because,
um,

1486
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:08,320
and you probably shouldn't take these
every day because you had normalized their

1487
01:32:08,321 --> 01:32:09,154
receptors.

1488
01:32:09,190 --> 01:32:12,670
And so Washington said the receptors and
having them recalibrate themselves is

1489
01:32:12,671 --> 01:32:15,640
probably a good thing to do.
So pulse therapy,

1490
01:32:15,880 --> 01:32:18,790
three to four days on
three to four days off is,

1491
01:32:18,791 --> 01:32:23,791
I'm probably a better approach than taking
them every day so that the jury's out

1492
01:32:25,691 --> 01:32:28,570
on that and a lot of different
opinions of it, of it. Some,

1493
01:32:29,030 --> 01:32:33,760
it's, it's endlessly fascinating though.
And you are right on the, on the money,

1494
01:32:33,761 --> 01:32:34,594
so to speak,

1495
01:32:34,690 --> 01:32:39,550
or lack of money given how effective
they are in limited number of sessions at

1496
01:32:40,060 --> 01:32:44,200
the combination,
which is certainly has been studied in,

1497
01:32:44,201 --> 01:32:48,970
is being studied of
efficacy and low toxicity.

1498
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:52,330
Um, and as you mentioned
earlier, if a rat, if you put,

1499
01:32:52,350 --> 01:32:55,510
and you know Michael Pollan and I have
chatted about this a little bit in his,

1500
01:32:55,570 --> 01:32:59,060
his podcast,
but if you were to administer say

1501
01:33:00,580 --> 01:33:04,790
to a rat and a box,
cocaine or heroin and they,

1502
01:33:04,910 --> 01:33:06,910
they have to choose between
those drugs or food,

1503
01:33:06,940 --> 01:33:11,940
they will consume these types of
opiates or stimulants until they die.

1504
01:33:12,030 --> 01:33:15,070
It did to the absence of food.
Whereas with say Lsd,

1505
01:33:15,530 --> 01:33:18,010
I would also assume psilocybin,
they,

1506
01:33:18,040 --> 01:33:22,000
they take one dose and that's the last
time they touched that particular battle.

1507
01:33:23,290 --> 01:33:25,670
And, uh, this is, uh,

1508
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:30,480
I don't want to take us too far field and
focus on this exclusively, but, uh, I,

1509
01:33:30,830 --> 01:33:35,830
I really appreciate you having spent so
much time to thinking about how these

1510
01:33:37,180 --> 01:33:42,180
natural companions who have coexisted end
of an ingested by humans for thousands

1511
01:33:43,030 --> 01:33:46,350
of years can be applied for some of these.
Uh,

1512
01:33:46,370 --> 01:33:50,610
that's the epidemic scale problems
that we're experiencing. And, uh,

1513
01:33:50,680 --> 01:33:53,080
I wanted to, uh, ask,

1514
01:33:53,110 --> 01:33:58,090
we are going to talk about some of the
applications of mushrooms outside of

1515
01:33:58,120 --> 01:33:59,020
human medicine,

1516
01:33:59,410 --> 01:34:04,240
but I would love to read a
description of you and then it,

1517
01:34:04,241 --> 01:34:06,880
it relates to something we were chatting
about a little bit before we started

1518
01:34:06,881 --> 01:34:11,881
recording and talk about the decisions
that made Paul Stamets Paul Stamets

1519
01:34:14,141 --> 01:34:18,160
because there are so many of
my colleges out there. Uh,

1520
01:34:18,161 --> 01:34:20,710
I've certainly don't know the
exact number, but you are,

1521
01:34:20,740 --> 01:34:24,760
if not the best known and certainly one
of the best known and the description is

1522
01:34:24,761 --> 01:34:28,370
from mother Jones, says, uh, uh,

1523
01:34:28,390 --> 01:34:32,470
Paul Stamets is a modern example of the
amateur scientist from the 17th and 18th

1524
01:34:32,471 --> 01:34:33,700
century who made a wonderful,

1525
01:34:33,730 --> 01:34:37,360
who made wonderful contributions with
only their native curiosity and keen sense

1526
01:34:37,361 --> 01:34:38,470
of observation.

1527
01:34:39,700 --> 01:34:44,080
And you can certainly comment on that
if you don't feel like it's accurate.

1528
01:34:44,081 --> 01:34:48,670
But what, what are the
decisions you made, if any,

1529
01:34:48,671 --> 01:34:53,671
come to mind or habits you've
cultivated that have allowed you,

1530
01:34:53,890 --> 01:34:57,080
helped you to arrive where
you are? I mean, you, uh,

1531
01:34:57,620 --> 01:35:00,150
has made many discoveries, youth, uh,

1532
01:35:00,890 --> 01:35:04,130
you've excelled in multiple fields.
Why is that?

1533
01:35:04,131 --> 01:35:07,070
How did you become who you
are in this current moment?

1534
01:35:07,130 --> 01:35:09,800
And you can start anywhere. I'd want
to be one of the people who asks you,

1535
01:35:09,801 --> 01:35:12,890
how do you grow mushrooms
at a cocktail party?

1536
01:35:13,540 --> 01:35:18,540
I have been exposed to a circle of
kindness and I believe in Karma.

1537
01:35:20,380 --> 01:35:25,380
I was a child who had a lot of problems
and I want a big debt of gratitude to my

1538
01:35:28,331 --> 01:35:29,890
professor,
Dr. Michael Buble.

1539
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:33,310
He never humiliated me and not
at the Evergreen State College.

1540
01:35:33,311 --> 01:35:36,790
I make some dumb statements.
He was entertained by them,

1541
01:35:37,390 --> 01:35:41,860
but it entertaining by them in a
humorous way that engaged me to explore,

1542
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:45,300
you know, um, you know,

1543
01:35:45,390 --> 01:35:47,740
in dive more deeply
into the subject matter.

1544
01:35:47,741 --> 01:35:52,741
But I was never humiliated
and as a circle of kindness.

1545
01:35:53,200 --> 01:35:56,720
And I really believe in Karma
because this isn't meant as,

1546
01:35:56,721 --> 01:36:01,290
it has been a huge thing in
my life is the fact that, um,

1547
01:36:01,480 --> 01:36:05,950
I believe evolution is an
extension of gratitude and Sharon,

1548
01:36:06,820 --> 01:36:09,920
and there's not this
necessarily this, this, um,

1549
01:36:10,360 --> 01:36:14,470
neo Darwinian concept of
competition and first to food wins.

1550
01:36:14,920 --> 01:36:19,480
It's that collaboration of people who are
allied together with common interests.

1551
01:36:19,930 --> 01:36:20,830
And we needed a shepherd,

1552
01:36:20,831 --> 01:36:25,750
all of our ourselves from our weaknesses
to become stronger. What very few,

1553
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:28,690
uh, lots of people know this, but very
few different schools that people know.

1554
01:36:28,691 --> 01:36:32,320
This. I got into the martial arts
when I was 14. I have two black belts.

1555
01:36:32,380 --> 01:36:35,860
I had schools for 30, 40 years. Um,

1556
01:36:35,980 --> 01:36:37,390
I have long haired Hippie,

1557
01:36:37,540 --> 01:36:42,540
the nice person and I kind of turn
it into a different individual.

1558
01:36:42,910 --> 01:36:46,090
I've been in thousands of
fights. Um, I started to aspen,

1559
01:36:46,120 --> 01:36:50,980
the category martial arts. I first
got into Goto, she showed con Szeto,

1560
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:54,550
got my first buckle belt in taekwondo,
and then begin on black on one Rango,

1561
01:36:55,030 --> 01:36:57,700
which is by far one of the most
sophisticated styles in the world,

1562
01:36:57,730 --> 01:37:01,450
similar to have Quito and, and, uh,
some of their styles, Cook School.

1563
01:37:02,200 --> 01:37:07,200
But that I had one experience that I
think is emblematic of this is that I was

1564
01:37:09,161 --> 01:37:13,320
an early young black belt in
taekwondo and big biker came in.

1565
01:37:13,350 --> 01:37:17,860
He was just seething with anger and
wired on fed amines and, and, um,

1566
01:37:17,890 --> 01:37:19,900
and he wants to fight a black belt,
you know,

1567
01:37:19,930 --> 01:37:23,530
just a biker dude and he's
just pissed off at the world.

1568
01:37:24,100 --> 01:37:26,130
And he came in and,
and number that hadn't,

1569
01:37:26,180 --> 01:37:29,680
instructor does not fight at a challenge
like this. They have too much to lose.

1570
01:37:29,681 --> 01:37:32,560
And you know, if they screw up, you know,
I lose face in front of students. So,

1571
01:37:32,790 --> 01:37:37,000
you know, many of them, my,
my head instructor, Jean said
it, Paul, I got another one.

1572
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:41,820
Okay. And, um, so there's
Michael Kamen and,

1573
01:37:42,070 --> 01:37:44,920
and then inside Lao lecture,
fight one of my black belts and it's fine.

1574
01:37:44,921 --> 01:37:48,310
So Paul come over here. And so I came
over there and was really polite and,

1575
01:37:48,311 --> 01:37:50,670
you know, I extend my hand, shook my
hand, and he went to shake my hand.

1576
01:37:50,700 --> 01:37:54,130
He just was all piss and vinegar and
wanting to fight me. And I said, well,

1577
01:37:54,131 --> 01:37:57,210
we have a few rules. Take
off shoes, you know, um, and,

1578
01:37:57,630 --> 01:38:01,860
and then we got out on the mat and this
guy just attacked me for Roche mostly.

1579
01:38:02,340 --> 01:38:04,680
I mean, it was, no, no, sort
of like a boxers, you know,

1580
01:38:04,681 --> 01:38:06,720
they have a little bit of like,
okay, let's do it. And you know,

1581
01:38:06,721 --> 01:38:10,140
we have a little compassion
for each other, you know,

1582
01:38:10,180 --> 01:38:13,170
the little simpatico or
another fellow warrior.

1583
01:38:13,270 --> 01:38:16,680
Now this guy was like out to hurt
me. That's how I block block, block,

1584
01:38:16,860 --> 01:38:18,630
block block and him and this guy is just,

1585
01:38:18,670 --> 01:38:22,590
you're just swinging and kicking in
and he can't kick well number one,

1586
01:38:22,591 --> 01:38:26,790
but he's just like overly aggressive and,
and you know, after a while, you know,

1587
01:38:26,791 --> 01:38:29,640
you can block 10 or 20 times, but you
know, you started getting hurt, right?

1588
01:38:29,641 --> 01:38:33,030
You know, these are these guys
just emotionally trying to hurt me.

1589
01:38:33,030 --> 01:38:37,140
And so I looked over at the,
my head instructor and he
nodded his head and said,

1590
01:38:37,141 --> 01:38:41,570
okay, Paul, time to
take them out, you know,

1591
01:38:41,810 --> 01:38:46,500
the three or four punches, you know, um,
sucker punched him, did a jumping hook,

1592
01:38:46,501 --> 01:38:48,930
kick, Bam, hit him in the temple,

1593
01:38:49,500 --> 01:38:53,970
Bam that he went down on the
ground, you know, semi-conscious.

1594
01:38:54,540 --> 01:38:58,170
And then I'm hovering over and
I put my hand onto his trachea.

1595
01:38:58,410 --> 01:39:02,650
I put my middle finger into the inside
of his eyeball and that way I could pop

1596
01:39:02,651 --> 01:39:05,040
his eyeball and pulling his
trache at the same time.

1597
01:39:05,310 --> 01:39:09,570
Now people are really concerned about
their vision and also in their face,

1598
01:39:09,870 --> 01:39:10,730
you know,
so the,

1599
01:39:10,740 --> 01:39:13,860
when you block your finger into the
eyeball and ready to take out the eyeball,

1600
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:18,600
people want to give up really fast. He
was terrified. He had the look of like,

1601
01:39:19,020 --> 01:39:21,990
Oh my God, I'm going to lose
my eyeball and this guy's
got it. You know, he didn't,

1602
01:39:22,230 --> 01:39:25,110
he was just waking up from being
stung from this kick, you know?

1603
01:39:25,200 --> 01:39:27,930
And I got him like that and I knew
I had to, okay, this is it. No,

1604
01:39:27,931 --> 01:39:30,510
I can take him out right now and this is
the end of his life, you know, end up,

1605
01:39:30,770 --> 01:39:34,110
you know, basically he's
done. And then I go,

1606
01:39:35,480 --> 01:39:37,250
I released, I said, you know,

1607
01:39:37,700 --> 01:39:41,270
you actually did really well and
I extended my hand in friendship.

1608
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:42,910
He's laying on the map,

1609
01:39:43,730 --> 01:39:48,560
big burly biker guy started
crying because I was nice to him.

1610
01:39:49,100 --> 01:39:52,190
I took him down but I
wasn't glorifying and my,

1611
01:39:52,191 --> 01:39:56,930
when I was extending my hand
in friendship changed his life.

1612
01:39:57,500 --> 01:40:01,100
When I left the school, he was a brown
belt. He became this big teddy bear.

1613
01:40:01,400 --> 01:40:04,430
You shepherding. Yeah. All these little,
I told him, listen, this girl here,

1614
01:40:04,431 --> 01:40:07,010
she's got a yellow belt. You've
got a white belt, you bow to her.

1615
01:40:07,650 --> 01:40:11,370
That's the way it works here.
Just based on your experience and respect.

1616
01:40:11,910 --> 01:40:13,990
Totally changed his life.
So,

1617
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:17,640
so that's a story of my life is
that you know the extension of,

1618
01:40:17,700 --> 01:40:20,940
and I think siliciden mushrooms
make people nicer people.

1619
01:40:21,720 --> 01:40:26,720
I just really believe that there is
this understanding that your life is not

1620
01:40:28,021 --> 01:40:28,890
just your life,

1621
01:40:29,130 --> 01:40:34,130
your life is in the context of nature
and how are we going to do inspire and

1622
01:40:34,770 --> 01:40:39,770
lead and promote the forces of good and
generosity and mutualism and how are we

1623
01:40:41,701 --> 01:40:45,900
going to get away from the people who
want to tear it all down by my work with

1624
01:40:45,901 --> 01:40:47,520
bees I think is is the,

1625
01:40:47,580 --> 01:40:52,500
is the cost of lab of my life and we're
definitely going to dig into that.

1626
01:40:52,690 --> 01:40:54,220
I absolutely want to explore

1627
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:55,930
it.
I was just going to echo what you said

1628
01:40:57,640 --> 01:41:00,520
about the power of kindness.
A friend of mine,

1629
01:41:00,521 --> 01:41:03,730
very good friend of mine was just
telling me recently who perhaps not

1630
01:41:03,731 --> 01:41:07,720
surprisingly has a lot of
psychonautic experience. Uh,

1631
01:41:08,180 --> 01:41:12,250
it's mileage with, uh, certain
mushrooms that we've been discussing.

1632
01:41:12,310 --> 01:41:14,380
And also for anyone who
doesn't know what maps is,

1633
01:41:14,381 --> 01:41:19,030
it's the multidisciplinary association
of Psychedelic Studies. They're also, uh,

1634
01:41:19,060 --> 01:41:19,481
focused,

1635
01:41:19,481 --> 01:41:24,481
very heavily on phase three trials
for MDA in the treatment of Ptsd.

1636
01:41:24,680 --> 01:41:28,460
Uh, which is, is fascinating
and I encourage people to
take a look at that at,

1637
01:41:28,470 --> 01:41:32,590
at maps.work. But what my friend
said to me is not too long ago,

1638
01:41:32,591 --> 01:41:36,980
several weeks ago, he went
into a coffee shop, uh,

1639
01:41:37,020 --> 01:41:39,910
and it was some Dunkin donuts or
something like that in an airport.

1640
01:41:40,120 --> 01:41:42,820
And this woman said,
thank you at the end of the transaction.

1641
01:41:42,821 --> 01:41:45,070
And he looked at her in the
eyes and he said, no, thank you.

1642
01:41:45,071 --> 01:41:47,200
And he was just kind of being a
joker and he's a charming guy,

1643
01:41:47,201 --> 01:41:50,110
but he meant it very sincerely
and she just broke down crying.

1644
01:41:50,950 --> 01:41:53,170
Similar experience.
Like she had not had,

1645
01:41:53,200 --> 01:41:57,790
didn't seem anyone express kindness
to her and God knows how long,

1646
01:41:57,850 --> 01:42:01,480
I mean weeks, months. Who knows? And it,

1647
01:42:01,540 --> 01:42:03,040
it just was such a stark reminder,

1648
01:42:03,041 --> 01:42:07,810
just like your story about the power of
those little acts as tiny little micro

1649
01:42:07,811 --> 01:42:10,330
decisions that we all make
thousands of times a day.

1650
01:42:10,810 --> 01:42:14,060
And that's what, you know,
I have a business, you know,

1651
01:42:14,570 --> 01:42:18,670
but anybody who was ordered from
our business, I own the business.

1652
01:42:18,671 --> 01:42:23,470
So I run it and I had several years ago
I got these little stickers that say you

1653
01:42:23,471 --> 01:42:24,304
are beautiful.

1654
01:42:25,170 --> 01:42:29,740
And every time someone orders from
our business and their order are too,

1655
01:42:30,250 --> 01:42:31,720
you are beautiful stickers.

1656
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:35,410
And I've had so many people right
saying there was just a horrible day,

1657
01:42:35,411 --> 01:42:39,400
a physician or just wrote
recently he had said, oh my God,

1658
01:42:39,460 --> 01:42:43,720
I cannot believe this little messaging I
sent too because then they can pass one

1659
01:42:43,721 --> 01:42:47,860
forward. So every order and
every box there are two.

1660
01:42:47,861 --> 01:42:49,210
You are beautiful stickers.

1661
01:42:49,540 --> 01:42:53,440
And so many people have written saying
that's what they needed to see that

1662
01:42:53,441 --> 01:42:58,210
changed their entire day. That again, an
extension of gratitude and affirmation.

1663
01:42:58,750 --> 01:43:02,140
You know,
and we are all on this planet together.

1664
01:43:02,470 --> 01:43:06,220
We lifted live in this time and space.
Tim, you're going to die. I'm gonna die.

1665
01:43:06,280 --> 01:43:10,080
Everybody listening to this podcast
is going to die. But we ran,

1666
01:43:10,090 --> 01:43:12,520
we enter into the fabric of
nature from which we sprung.

1667
01:43:13,360 --> 01:43:16,810
And I think that fabric an Hra is
based on the extension of goodness.

1668
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:22,120
I just know it empirically and all
the noise we have around politics and

1669
01:43:22,121 --> 01:43:26,380
everything else is just
so narrowly focused in the
context of the greater being.

1670
01:43:27,100 --> 01:43:31,000
I think that we're on the verge of where
science and spirituality are converging

1671
01:43:31,810 --> 01:43:34,810
and now we're understanding nature
and the extent of the cosmos,

1672
01:43:35,500 --> 01:43:39,940
the hundreds of billions of
galaxies. I mean just, um,

1673
01:43:40,120 --> 01:43:44,020
I always wanted to be an astro mycologist.
I kind of am now in some sense,

1674
01:43:44,021 --> 01:43:47,830
but I've always wanted to, I think we'll
find fungal networks throughout nature,

1675
01:43:48,250 --> 01:43:50,410
throughout the universe,
on multiple planets.

1676
01:43:50,750 --> 01:43:53,540
Multicellular organisms
will form is networks.

1677
01:43:53,900 --> 01:43:57,280
Networks will give rise to animals.
And I think that the,

1678
01:43:57,290 --> 01:44:02,290
we are a descendant of this network based
paradigm that's represented not only

1679
01:44:02,520 --> 01:44:06,320
and mycelium and a neurons,
the computer internet.

1680
01:44:06,350 --> 01:44:07,880
The Organization of the dark matter.

1681
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:12,860
This is a continuum and a
keen continuation on different
orders of magnitude of

1682
01:44:12,861 --> 01:44:14,600
the way of being.

1683
01:44:15,530 --> 01:44:20,530
We are all involved in this network of
being and this is just one of our strands

1684
01:44:21,020 --> 01:44:22,490
in that network that we're living today.

1685
01:44:23,180 --> 01:44:28,180
And I want to get to bees and I'm going
to get to it by way of laying out some

1686
01:44:30,831 --> 01:44:34,490
illustrations of these,
these webs,

1687
01:44:34,520 --> 01:44:36,320
these strands of interconnectedness.

1688
01:44:36,321 --> 01:44:40,760
And this is from discover
magazine from a few years back.

1689
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:45,860
And I'm just going to quote here,
it'll take 30 to 60 seconds probably.

1690
01:44:46,250 --> 01:44:50,990
And then I want to talk about bees
specifically. Uh, it starts with this,

1691
01:44:50,991 --> 01:44:53,010
and this is a very incomplete
list of course, but stem is,

1692
01:44:53,011 --> 01:44:56,480
is researching a wide variety of ways
in which fungi could help solve human

1693
01:44:56,481 --> 01:44:59,630
problems. Here's a partial list.
One, environmental cleanup.

1694
01:44:59,660 --> 01:45:02,810
Mushrooms could be used to break down
petrochemicals or observe radiation from

1695
01:45:02,811 --> 01:45:06,710
contaminated soil and water
to wastewater filtration.

1696
01:45:07,060 --> 01:45:10,790
A mushroom Mycelia could cleanse runoff
from storm grims farms or log logging

1697
01:45:10,791 --> 01:45:12,470
roads. They can be used to
filter out the nitrates,

1698
01:45:12,471 --> 01:45:16,190
endocrine disruptors and pharmaceutical
residues that disrupt ecosystems and

1699
01:45:16,191 --> 01:45:18,830
damaged human health.
Three pesticides,

1700
01:45:18,831 --> 01:45:21,950
fungal bug killers or treat discuss could
be used to target troublesome species

1701
01:45:21,951 --> 01:45:26,840
while remaining nontoxic to other four
medicines which we've we've discussed

1702
01:45:27,130 --> 01:45:29,030
could provide new antibiotic,
antiviral,

1703
01:45:29,031 --> 01:45:31,280
and immune boosting compounds
and even chemotherapies.

1704
01:45:31,700 --> 01:45:36,700
Five forestry planting symbiotic mushroom
species could speed reforestation and

1705
01:45:37,191 --> 01:45:40,040
clearcut woodlands. Six
agriculture adding, Ooh,

1706
01:45:40,041 --> 01:45:43,820
this is the word that I can
never pronounce. Adding Myc, o.

1707
01:45:43,821 --> 01:45:47,390
R. R. A. H. E. A. L. How
do, how do we say that?

1708
01:45:47,930 --> 01:45:50,060
Microrisal microrisal thank you.

1709
01:45:50,480 --> 01:45:54,140
Adding microrisal fungi to soil could
improve crop yields without the need for

1710
01:45:54,141 --> 01:45:56,630
toxic chemical fertilizers.
Seven famine relief.

1711
01:45:56,660 --> 01:46:00,080
Mushrooms can be grown rapidly in refugee
camps in disaster zones using just

1712
01:46:00,081 --> 01:46:02,960
woodchips or salt water soaked Straw.

1713
01:46:03,170 --> 01:46:06,860
Eight biofuels growing mushrooms for
biodiesel could require far less soil and

1714
01:46:06,861 --> 01:46:09,020
other resources and commonly
cultivated fueled crops.

1715
01:46:09,350 --> 01:46:12,530
Nine which segues to what
we were just chatting about.

1716
01:46:12,531 --> 01:46:15,860
Space travel because of their usefulness
and soil creation and the tolerance of

1717
01:46:15,861 --> 01:46:17,120
many species for radiation.

1718
01:46:17,480 --> 01:46:21,290
Mushrooms could be grown by interstellar
voyagers and use to terraform other

1719
01:46:21,291 --> 01:46:24,440
worlds. So I'm going to pause here
for one second just to let people,

1720
01:46:24,860 --> 01:46:29,810
so in that and then second in both
preparation for this conversation but also

1721
01:46:29,811 --> 01:46:34,811
over the last two years reading various
descriptions of what has been called the

1722
01:46:35,571 --> 01:46:39,130
the Wood Wide Web I think is
what they call it, the, you know,

1723
01:46:39,180 --> 01:46:44,180
the mycelium and how they facilitate
communication between trees and other

1724
01:46:44,781 --> 01:46:48,410
organisms. It's really mind
bending stuff. I mean it's, it's,

1725
01:46:49,080 --> 01:46:54,080
it's the type of narrative and description
and discovery that if described,

1726
01:46:54,450 --> 01:46:55,710
I'm just making this up perhaps,

1727
01:46:55,711 --> 01:47:00,630
but like 50 years ago would have
been thought science fiction and uh,

1728
01:47:00,720 --> 01:47:05,720
I would love for you to describe what
you have done in the world of bees,

1729
01:47:07,260 --> 01:47:11,850
but I just find this so not
only staggeringly fascinating
and much of it counter

1730
01:47:11,851 --> 01:47:16,470
intuitive but important. Um, so that's my,

1731
01:47:16,500 --> 01:47:18,910
that's my soapbox for the moment.
But then in any case, would,

1732
01:47:18,920 --> 01:47:20,490
would love you to take
that wherever you'd like.

1733
01:47:21,310 --> 01:47:24,620
Okay. Well I would recommend that
people read my book, mycelium running,

1734
01:47:24,860 --> 01:47:28,880
how mushrooms can help save the world.
It covers into these subjects a very,

1735
01:47:28,881 --> 01:47:30,750
very deeply, um, and,

1736
01:47:30,830 --> 01:47:34,430
and a book is using it now as an
introductory mycology book had many

1737
01:47:34,431 --> 01:47:36,170
universities.
Um,

1738
01:47:36,470 --> 01:47:40,600
I typically don't promote
a product from stage. He,

1739
01:47:40,610 --> 01:47:42,380
there's no lectures out there.
You can find this,

1740
01:47:42,381 --> 01:47:46,880
but I do want to draw people's attention
to fungi.com [inaudible] dot com

1741
01:47:47,220 --> 01:47:51,680
there's an amazing letter from a
Syrian refugee. And I want people,

1742
01:47:51,720 --> 01:47:55,940
we obscured his face because we don't
want him to be targeted by Assad Assad's

1743
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:57,470
assassins.
Uh,

1744
01:47:57,471 --> 01:48:01,700
but he has brought in mushroom cultivation
and in refugee camps using recyclable

1745
01:48:02,180 --> 01:48:05,810
materials from the cardboard and
all the paper. And he literally,

1746
01:48:05,811 --> 01:48:08,960
you have to read the letter to it
just brings tears to your eyes.

1747
01:48:08,961 --> 01:48:12,740
He's over a thousand people now
engaged in growing mushrooms,

1748
01:48:12,741 --> 01:48:15,100
oyster mushrooms and
refugee camps, and then, uh,

1749
01:48:15,230 --> 01:48:20,090
from the Syrian crisis that are
helping people feed themselves. And,

1750
01:48:20,091 --> 01:48:21,310
um,
and um,

1751
01:48:21,440 --> 01:48:25,990
think about all of those thousand people
now understanding how to grow mushrooms,

1752
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:29,960
what the downstream effect will be with
their children when they get out of this

1753
01:48:29,961 --> 01:48:34,490
camps. They'll have skillsets that can
really expand this. And in a huge way.

1754
01:48:35,010 --> 01:48:35,843
Um,

1755
01:48:36,440 --> 01:48:41,440
I believe that mycelium is the
foundation of the food web.

1756
01:48:43,990 --> 01:48:46,580
It is essential for food biosecurity.

1757
01:48:47,030 --> 01:48:50,450
I mentioned that the mycelium
creates the micro biomes.

1758
01:48:50,451 --> 01:48:53,390
We've done next gen sequencing
and we've been able to prove this.

1759
01:48:53,660 --> 01:48:54,680
I have not published it,

1760
01:48:54,681 --> 01:48:58,850
but people can see my talks on it
showing that different mycelium Mycelial,

1761
01:48:58,890 --> 01:49:02,280
mass control and uh,

1762
01:49:02,690 --> 01:49:07,690
destined populations of bacteria are
uniquely specific to the mycelium that had

1763
01:49:07,730 --> 01:49:11,780
growing, uh, in, in, uh,
wood chips are in Straw.

1764
01:49:12,160 --> 01:49:17,150
And so they actually articulate the
populations and bacteria a downstream from

1765
01:49:17,151 --> 01:49:21,720
the mycelial networks. But this is
going to segue. So we talked about the,

1766
01:49:21,721 --> 01:49:25,940
the antiviral stuff and over the bio
shield bio defense program and nine 11.

1767
01:49:27,100 --> 01:49:31,760
Well, and I had this entimopathogenic
fungi patents and they're working against

1768
01:49:32,900 --> 01:49:36,980
termites,
carpenter ants and bedbugs and mice.

1769
01:49:37,040 --> 01:49:39,170
And so a good friend of mine,
Louie Schwartzberg,

1770
01:49:39,680 --> 01:49:44,300
he actually has finished a movie called
fantastic fungi is coming out in the

1771
01:49:44,300 --> 01:49:47,680
next few months. We've been
making it for over 10 years, um,

1772
01:49:47,800 --> 01:49:50,800
with a linear Lynn Lear,
Norman Lear,

1773
01:49:51,640 --> 01:49:56,580
and isn't that group. And the,
I just saw the final cut, um,

1774
01:49:56,670 --> 01:50:00,850
a few days ago. It is quite good. I'm
really happy we're where it's going,

1775
01:50:00,851 --> 01:50:05,080
but it talks about the wood wide web
and Susan's Tamara is a British Columbia

1776
01:50:05,350 --> 01:50:09,790
mycologists and I'm a total fan of her
work and in a big Kudos to her because

1777
01:50:10,150 --> 01:50:13,750
she and I are two peas in a pod and she
was doing her work parallel to my doing

1778
01:50:13,751 --> 01:50:17,950
mine and, and we ended up, you know,
really and the, and the, the same, uh,

1779
01:50:17,951 --> 01:50:20,560
intellectual ecosystem so to speak.
Um,

1780
01:50:20,890 --> 01:50:25,780
but so when Louie was doing a movie and
he was looking at butterflies and then

1781
01:50:25,781 --> 01:50:29,800
he got into bees and Connie claps and
colony collapse is really a client.

1782
01:50:29,801 --> 01:50:32,800
Claps disordered is a
euphemism created by the media,

1783
01:50:33,130 --> 01:50:37,100
but it does speak to a very serious issue.
Um,

1784
01:50:37,210 --> 01:50:38,980
and Oklahoma last year,

1785
01:50:38,981 --> 01:50:42,220
74% of the beehives died.

1786
01:50:43,450 --> 01:50:44,283
I'll think of it.

1787
01:50:44,830 --> 01:50:49,830
If you were having a cattle or sheep
at your ranch and you lost 75%,

1788
01:50:50,711 --> 01:50:53,020
or is your sheep are accountable.
That is devastating.

1789
01:50:53,460 --> 01:50:56,620
Let's also devastating to beekeepers.
Um,

1790
01:50:56,740 --> 01:51:01,740
35% or more of our food is directly
dependent upon bee pollination.

1791
01:51:01,930 --> 01:51:03,550
70% is indirect.

1792
01:51:04,180 --> 01:51:07,660
Many people don't realize that most of
our dairy products are dependent upon bee

1793
01:51:07,661 --> 01:51:11,050
pollination because I'll fall flat
and hey, it depended upon bees.

1794
01:51:11,080 --> 01:51:13,690
All the almonds that you consume,

1795
01:51:13,810 --> 01:51:17,770
every one almond that you consume
was visited by a B on that flower.

1796
01:51:18,330 --> 01:51:22,510
And so the almond industry specifically
needs honey bees in particular.

1797
01:51:23,410 --> 01:51:24,880
And so, and then Louie
came and he said, Paul,

1798
01:51:24,900 --> 01:51:28,420
this is a huge problem with colony
collapse and bees are dying.

1799
01:51:28,960 --> 01:51:31,720
What can you do about it?
Well,

1800
01:51:32,140 --> 01:51:35,800
I had a series of events,
um,

1801
01:51:36,100 --> 01:51:37,360
and these events,

1802
01:51:37,361 --> 01:51:40,530
when you string them together and
led to me and to an epiphany and the,

1803
01:51:40,531 --> 01:51:42,720
I am a controversial mycologist.

1804
01:51:43,240 --> 01:51:46,900
I have been trained academically in
Mycology as an undergraduate student.

1805
01:51:47,620 --> 01:51:51,640
But I married a woman 11 years
older than me who had three kids,

1806
01:51:52,120 --> 01:51:55,090
a 12, 14, and 16. When I was 22,

1807
01:51:56,110 --> 01:51:59,410
I couldn't afford to move my kids to
other cities to go to graduate school.

1808
01:51:59,411 --> 01:52:01,990
I got accepted into several graduate
schools, but I couldn't afford to move.

1809
01:52:02,440 --> 01:52:06,790
So I started this little
mail order business impact
30,000 boxes before I had a

1810
01:52:06,791 --> 01:52:09,250
single employee.
Now I have over a hundred employees.

1811
01:52:09,850 --> 01:52:14,230
So it's a real testimonial to stamina
and good luck and also the extension of

1812
01:52:14,231 --> 01:52:18,370
generosity by some very kind people who
came to my rescue a few times over my

1813
01:52:18,371 --> 01:52:23,260
life. But in the course of looking at, uh,

1814
01:52:23,770 --> 01:52:26,710
at the situation with bees,
I started looking at it and there's,

1815
01:52:26,770 --> 01:52:28,600
there's many cofactors now,

1816
01:52:29,050 --> 01:52:34,050
health or disease in my mind is a
series of coefficient variables.

1817
01:52:34,840 --> 01:52:38,320
Factors which are strung together at
the end of the equation means health or

1818
01:52:38,321 --> 01:52:39,154
disease.

1819
01:52:39,460 --> 01:52:44,460
So there's not a single cause for
colony collapse is a perfect storm of

1820
01:52:45,351 --> 01:52:50,060
unfortunately bad things are
happening to the bees habitat loss one

1821
01:52:50,450 --> 01:52:53,240
neonicotinoids we already know
they'd been banned in Europe,

1822
01:52:53,540 --> 01:52:57,620
ironically from a study that Berenson
Genesis sponsored thinking that neo nics

1823
01:52:57,621 --> 01:53:01,240
would not be toxic and they found out they
were toxic and so they were abandoned.

1824
01:53:01,250 --> 01:53:05,300
Europe last month. Mnemonics are still
used in the United States and Canada.

1825
01:53:05,930 --> 01:53:10,370
Um, these, there's so many, 70%
of the food has talked to me. Uh,

1826
01:53:10,550 --> 01:53:14,750
absolutely critically dependent
upon bee pollination services.

1827
01:53:15,140 --> 01:53:19,550
You know, um, two arms length away
from direct bee pollination contact.

1828
01:53:20,750 --> 01:53:25,070
So bees are dying because of a confluence
of variables. Last Hub, habitat,

1829
01:53:25,100 --> 01:53:28,990
neo nics, pesticide exposure, factory
farming. It's not natural for me.

1830
01:53:28,991 --> 01:53:32,690
It's been put on trucks and traveled a
thousand miles to the almond orchards of

1831
01:53:32,691 --> 01:53:37,220
California. They all are
concentrated. They spread
diseases amongst themselves. Uh,

1832
01:53:37,221 --> 01:53:41,200
and then they disperse. And so it's
a, that's the great, great, uh,

1833
01:53:41,450 --> 01:53:44,870
scenario for diseases be spread.
But by far,

1834
01:53:44,871 --> 01:53:49,130
the biggest one that's been identified
in the scientific literature is the

1835
01:53:49,130 --> 01:53:53,690
Varroa Mite. The Varroa mite was
introduced in 1987. It came from Asia.

1836
01:53:54,050 --> 01:53:58,850
Varroa destructor assessed this
Latin by no do I know the binomial.

1837
01:53:59,240 --> 01:54:04,190
It injects a whole slew of
viruses into the bees. And these,

1838
01:54:04,191 --> 01:54:04,670
uh,

1839
01:54:04,670 --> 01:54:09,670
these now all bees in the world have
these viruses working with the USDA,

1840
01:54:09,861 --> 01:54:11,960
Dr Jay Evans and a,

1841
01:54:11,961 --> 01:54:16,910
it was a USDA neurologist who's widely
published in a senior scientists at the

1842
01:54:16,911 --> 01:54:21,080
Usda ag has not seen a virus
Freebie more than 10 years.

1843
01:54:21,770 --> 01:54:25,550
What's happened now is a virus that's
being spread by the Varroa mite.

1844
01:54:25,640 --> 01:54:30,640
The Varroa Mite was controlled by might
aside that was used to control ticks on

1845
01:54:31,911 --> 01:54:33,610
cattle called amtrust.

1846
01:54:34,550 --> 01:54:38,150
Now Amma tries is not legal to use
by beekeepers, but they use it.

1847
01:54:38,780 --> 01:54:43,000
They were soaking their beehives
with this. Emma is toxic,

1848
01:54:43,420 --> 01:54:44,180
you know,

1849
01:54:44,180 --> 01:54:49,180
tick might aside and they're drenching
it twice per year to control the Mites

1850
01:54:49,670 --> 01:54:52,880
and now they're up to eight
times per year. Within 10 years,

1851
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:54,740
the Mites have developed a resistance.

1852
01:54:55,700 --> 01:54:59,390
The mites are like having a pancake
on your back. They attach themselves,

1853
01:54:59,391 --> 01:55:00,860
are extremely hard to dislodge.

1854
01:55:01,550 --> 01:55:05,380
And now 27 viruses have been
identified being vectored by Mike.

1855
01:55:06,380 --> 01:55:08,120
What's the big surprises?

1856
01:55:08,150 --> 01:55:13,150
All the wild bees now have these viruses
and 80% of the pollination services

1857
01:55:13,970 --> 01:55:18,740
that we benefit from, from
bees pollinating are actually
coming from wild bees,

1858
01:55:19,370 --> 01:55:23,570
not the honeybee, which is
[inaudible], which is a huge colony.

1859
01:55:23,570 --> 01:55:28,370
So the wild bees are oftentimes called
solitary bees are very small groups of a

1860
01:55:28,370 --> 01:55:30,140
dozen B's or two dozen
bees or ground dwellers.

1861
01:55:31,640 --> 01:55:36,640
And those bees provide over 80% of the
services that are benefiting a APP called

1862
01:55:37,010 --> 01:55:40,000
culture.
So the honeybees demand,

1863
01:55:40,010 --> 01:55:43,620
we have about 2 million
hives and the United States,

1864
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:47,970
the average loss right now
is over 50% nationally.

1865
01:55:48,060 --> 01:55:52,440
A few hot spots where there's hot spots
then emanate out and epidemics become

1866
01:55:52,441 --> 01:55:57,390
pandemics. And so now we have
evolved into a viral pandemic, uh,

1867
01:55:57,391 --> 01:55:59,250
of these viruses spreading
throughout the world.

1868
01:55:59,820 --> 01:56:01,530
And it was just discovered
in the past two year,

1869
01:56:01,531 --> 01:56:05,070
three years that these bees are
infected with these viruses.

1870
01:56:05,071 --> 01:56:08,520
When they visit a flower and
they get the pollen on them,

1871
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,430
they also spread the viruses to the palm.
They leave.

1872
01:56:12,240 --> 01:56:14,430
And so when the wild bees come,
they become infected.

1873
01:56:15,240 --> 01:56:18,630
So this is a direct threat to
worldwide food biosecurity.

1874
01:56:19,350 --> 01:56:23,880
The loss of bees is such an important
issue in interestingly is the number one

1875
01:56:23,881 --> 01:56:28,260
bridge issue between liberals and
conservatives. So I like to delve even Ui,

1876
01:56:28,261 --> 01:56:31,110
thanksgiving dinner. You don't want
to talk about Hillary or Trump.

1877
01:56:31,470 --> 01:56:35,160
Talk about the importance of bees is the
number one issue that brings liberals

1878
01:56:35,161 --> 01:56:38,340
and conservatives together
because everyone recognizes
the importance of bees.

1879
01:56:38,390 --> 01:56:41,520
Uh,
as it is for food biosecurity.

1880
01:56:42,330 --> 01:56:47,310
So my friend Louis came to
me and I started studying
this subject and I had five

1881
01:56:47,311 --> 01:56:51,030
experiences in row that
led to me to an epiphany.

1882
01:56:51,510 --> 01:56:54,540
And no matter what my critics say,
and I, you know, I've been wrong,

1883
01:56:54,541 --> 01:56:57,540
sometimes I'm not right all the time,
so I accept that,

1884
01:56:57,990 --> 01:57:00,870
but I pushed the envelope because
I don't have to worry about tenure.

1885
01:57:01,140 --> 01:57:03,900
I'm self employed.
I can risk to be wrong.

1886
01:57:04,410 --> 01:57:07,560
But the more I speculate,
the more I test,

1887
01:57:07,561 --> 01:57:10,950
the more I do research, you
know, that's what it takes.

1888
01:57:10,950 --> 01:57:13,770
It takes the efforts to
see if something will work.

1889
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:16,740
And so I failed a lot of times in
the failures, the price of tuition.

1890
01:57:16,741 --> 01:57:20,700
I paid to learn a new lesson. All
that being said, this is what happened

1891
01:57:22,430 --> 01:57:26,130
in 1984 I had the garden giant
mushroom growing in my garden.

1892
01:57:26,290 --> 01:57:29,340
It's a wood chip mushroom that grows
in wood chips, prisons, mushrooms,

1893
01:57:29,341 --> 01:57:33,900
up to five pounds per specimen. People
can look it up. Um, and I had these,

1894
01:57:33,960 --> 01:57:38,340
which shifts permeated with mycelium and
I have two beehives and one day in July

1895
01:57:38,341 --> 01:57:43,341
come out and I see the bees all over my
wood chips and I looked really closely

1896
01:57:44,190 --> 01:57:46,350
and they're moving the
wood chips to aside,

1897
01:57:46,500 --> 01:57:49,050
it's like you pushing a semi
truck through side some of these,

1898
01:57:49,051 --> 01:57:51,930
which was really big
to expose the mycelium.

1899
01:57:52,700 --> 01:57:56,310
I looked very carefully and
from dawn to dusk for 40 days,

1900
01:57:56,700 --> 01:58:00,690
there's a continuous convoy of bees
to the my wood chips of the garden.

1901
01:58:00,690 --> 01:58:05,690
Giant mycelium in my garden traveling
about 800 to a thousand feet as a,

1902
01:58:06,550 --> 01:58:10,500
I went out there, I photographed up,
thank God I found the photographs.

1903
01:58:10,501 --> 01:58:13,680
There were Kodachrome 64 slides
and sweltering heat. You know,

1904
01:58:13,681 --> 01:58:15,450
two years ago I found him up in the attic.

1905
01:58:15,960 --> 01:58:18,300
But I published this
in Harrison's magazine,

1906
01:58:18,301 --> 01:58:22,510
1988 I published this in 1994 in
growing gourmet and medicinal mushrooms.

1907
01:58:22,560 --> 01:58:24,450
One of my books.
And I speculated,

1908
01:58:24,480 --> 01:58:27,240
oh the bees are going after
the sugar rich extra dates.

1909
01:58:27,570 --> 01:58:31,020
Cause the mycelium is producing these
polysaccharides that are sweet and they're

1910
01:58:31,021 --> 01:58:35,370
fragrant. And maybe that's why the bees
are going there. Okay, that's, that's one.

1911
01:58:35,400 --> 01:58:37,620
I'm going to give you a
Michael factorial equation.

1912
01:58:38,250 --> 01:58:43,180
So that's the first Michael Factor.
Factor number. Paul sees B's attractive,

1913
01:58:43,181 --> 01:58:48,070
the wood chips in his garden,
I forgot about it, Michael.

1914
01:58:48,071 --> 01:58:50,060
Factor number two,
Paul gets involved,

1915
01:58:50,080 --> 01:58:55,080
the Bio Shield program discovers that
Pauline for mushrooms have antiviral

1916
01:58:55,271 --> 01:59:00,070
properties and many patents have issued.
Now I have more patents on this.

1917
01:59:00,071 --> 01:59:02,350
People can look them up.
Um,

1918
01:59:02,380 --> 01:59:07,380
and so that was another experience that
I had a number three and by getting rid

1919
01:59:07,660 --> 01:59:10,420
of the carpenter ranch than my
house Cz entimopathogenic fungus,

1920
01:59:10,421 --> 01:59:14,380
we lighten that insects
are vectors of disease.

1921
01:59:15,520 --> 01:59:16,960
And then moving forward,

1922
01:59:17,680 --> 01:59:22,680
I'm looking at the research articles
and and plus it's an open source,

1923
01:59:24,700 --> 01:59:26,890
you know, an online
journal, Scientific Journal.

1924
01:59:27,340 --> 01:59:32,340
There's an on the cover of the plus was
a big article on the discovery that Sema

1925
01:59:34,441 --> 01:59:35,650
colony collapse happens.

1926
01:59:35,651 --> 01:59:39,190
Most people don't know this is that
you got your beehives on Monday.

1927
01:59:39,310 --> 01:59:43,120
Everything is fine. You go out there
on Thursday and they're all gone,

1928
01:59:44,180 --> 01:59:45,013
they're gone.

1929
01:59:45,250 --> 01:59:48,010
It's not like there's a whole bunch of
dead bees lang in front of the beehive.

1930
01:59:48,790 --> 01:59:51,160
They're gone.
They fly away.

1931
01:59:52,240 --> 01:59:57,100
It turns out that the bees
are the deformed wing virus,

1932
01:59:57,160 --> 02:00:00,970
which is the number one virus of concern
that's been identified by researchers.

1933
02:00:00,970 --> 02:00:05,710
Almost a dozen papers have been published
in the past three years identifying

1934
02:00:05,711 --> 02:00:06,021
the deal.

1935
02:00:06,021 --> 02:00:10,240
You've worn deformed wing virus as the
virus that is the most debilitating to

1936
02:00:10,241 --> 02:00:13,270
the bees. It normally, we just did
a tensile strength of their wings,

1937
02:00:13,271 --> 02:00:17,140
but they're deformed. They can't
fly it all. We see bees on flower,

1938
02:00:17,141 --> 02:00:21,580
it's the last days of their life.
These used to go out,

1939
02:00:21,670 --> 02:00:25,960
they get pollen for nine days and
now they're going out for four days,

1940
02:00:26,710 --> 02:00:30,950
so they can't enough pollen back to
the hive. So the new [inaudible],

1941
02:00:30,970 --> 02:00:35,020
which are nurse bees are prematurely
recruited to go out to get pollen because

1942
02:00:35,021 --> 02:00:40,021
the colony is stressed and then the
brood as Mites on them and the bees can't

1943
02:00:40,870 --> 02:00:41,930
attend to the brute.

1944
02:00:41,950 --> 02:00:46,420
They abandoned the babies and the mites
then freely go around injecting these

1945
02:00:46,421 --> 02:00:48,280
viruses into the bees.

1946
02:00:48,910 --> 02:00:53,290
And so at some point it comes to a
tipping point and then the bees leave the

1947
02:00:53,291 --> 02:00:56,860
hive and they don't come back.
So imagine if you were again,

1948
02:00:57,250 --> 02:00:58,960
a cattle rancher or a sheep rancher,

1949
02:00:58,961 --> 02:01:02,320
he loses more than 50% of your
estate is psychologically damaging.

1950
02:01:02,560 --> 02:01:05,560
It's all economically damaging
and people just give up.

1951
02:01:06,610 --> 02:01:11,610
So I had these experiences and then I
saw in this journal that when they looked

1952
02:01:11,741 --> 02:01:14,650
at the honey and the
abandoned Pete beehives,

1953
02:01:14,940 --> 02:01:19,680
it lacked a certain chemical
called peak tumeric acid peak.

1954
02:01:19,681 --> 02:01:24,681
Americ acid is the chemical trigger that
governs the detoxification pathway in

1955
02:01:25,031 --> 02:01:29,170
bees. It's called the cytochrome p
four 50 pathway. All animals use it.

1956
02:01:29,440 --> 02:01:32,380
We have it mostly in our liver
is how we break down toxins.

1957
02:01:32,770 --> 02:01:37,330
Without peak Americ acid, they found
these bees hundreds of pounds of honey,

1958
02:01:37,600 --> 02:01:42,590
no bs in the beehive. It lacks
essential nutrient peaking Americ acid.

1959
02:01:42,830 --> 02:01:46,310
I'm not a chemist, but I'd seen
peak America House and before,

1960
02:01:46,700 --> 02:01:48,110
because in the research I've done,

1961
02:01:48,680 --> 02:01:50,870
look at what's called the
d lignification of wood,

1962
02:01:50,871 --> 02:01:53,420
how fungi gobble up
wood and break it down.

1963
02:01:54,560 --> 02:01:59,180
And I recognized he America acid as a
chemical constituent that was present, uh,

1964
02:01:59,550 --> 02:02:02,010
in breaking down wood.
And that's why you see my ciliated would,

1965
02:02:02,011 --> 02:02:04,070
is smells fragrant and no difference.

1966
02:02:04,280 --> 02:02:07,820
There's a lot I outgassing
of chef Michael Flavanoids,

1967
02:02:08,180 --> 02:02:11,260
a phenol phenolic compounds
that are going into,

1968
02:02:11,270 --> 02:02:15,980
and that's why after a rain and the the
woods, the wood steel, it smells so good.

1969
02:02:16,040 --> 02:02:17,480
That's the outgassing of mycelium.

1970
02:02:17,660 --> 02:02:21,140
All these sent trails are being created
to entice us in insects and other

1971
02:02:21,260 --> 02:02:25,010
animals to follow centrals and part
of the outgassing of the mycelium.

1972
02:02:26,330 --> 02:02:31,220
Okay, I had all those four
experiences and then I go to sleep

1973
02:02:32,750 --> 02:02:37,370
and I have a waking dream and then it's
waking dream hit me like a lightening

1974
02:02:37,371 --> 02:02:41,360
bolt. I said, oh my God, I
woke up, I think. I said,

1975
02:02:41,420 --> 02:02:42,950
I think I know how to save the bees.

1976
02:02:43,790 --> 02:02:47,360
And so I first called a very good friend
of mine, Lee Stein. I said, listen,

1977
02:02:47,361 --> 02:02:51,710
that's how this a waking dream.
I just shook me to the core.

1978
02:02:52,130 --> 02:02:54,980
He said, stop everything you're doing.
Focus on this. This is too important.

1979
02:02:55,490 --> 02:02:56,690
So call it the universe of California.

1980
02:02:56,691 --> 02:03:00,140
Davis is never a good idea
to start a conversation.

1981
02:03:00,141 --> 02:03:04,190
But then there are scientists that you're
not, not met with words. I had a dream

1982
02:03:06,770 --> 02:03:10,520
that a conversation went nowhere.
It's like crazy person. Goodbye.

1983
02:03:10,930 --> 02:03:13,970
So I called the abortion state university.
I was at Ted,

1984
02:03:14,060 --> 02:03:15,800
I think I have to Ted that you spoke up.

1985
02:03:16,430 --> 02:03:20,840
And I was at Ted and I went out and I
was given Steve Sheppard's name from

1986
02:03:20,841 --> 02:03:24,390
Washington University. He's a chair of
entomology in Pullman, Washington, uh,

1987
02:03:24,560 --> 02:03:28,580
Washington University's Agricultural
Science College. And I said, listen Steve,

1988
02:03:28,581 --> 02:03:31,550
please just give me a half an hour.
It's going to sound crazy to you at first,

1989
02:03:31,551 --> 02:03:35,430
but let me talk to you about this.
About 15 minutes. And he said,

1990
02:03:35,431 --> 02:03:38,120
stop and go nowhere else.
We want to work with them.

1991
02:03:38,990 --> 02:03:43,940
So the end result of this is we tested
this on 532 beehives in southern

1992
02:03:43,941 --> 02:03:45,680
California two years ago.

1993
02:03:46,100 --> 02:03:49,580
We've done seven tests
now and outdoor beehives.

1994
02:03:50,210 --> 02:03:51,410
We have found something.

1995
02:03:51,440 --> 02:03:55,730
I think that it's extraordinary
breakthrough with our
mycelial extracts of these

1996
02:03:55,731 --> 02:03:58,020
poly pore mushrooms, these, these Woodcox.

1997
02:03:58,070 --> 02:04:02,810
They look like they're called him hooked
shaped mushrooms that grow on trees.

1998
02:04:02,870 --> 02:04:05,000
Everyone's seen them.
Um,

1999
02:04:05,420 --> 02:04:10,100
with the mycelium that's
extracted and water and ethanol,

2000
02:04:10,101 --> 02:04:13,430
the very same extracts that we use in
the bowel. You about defense program,

2001
02:04:14,420 --> 02:04:19,280
we gave it to the bees and we've submitted
an article to a renowned scientific

2002
02:04:19,281 --> 02:04:23,870
journal and from one dose at 1%,

2003
02:04:23,960 --> 02:04:28,640
all beekeepers feed sugar water to their
bees is 50% sugar fish without water.

2004
02:04:28,790 --> 02:04:33,380
So one milliliter per hundred, you
know, one unit per hundred, 1%,

2005
02:04:33,980 --> 02:04:37,650
we give it to the bees in
the seven to 12 days later.

2006
02:04:37,830 --> 02:04:42,660
Those viruses are reduced by thousands
of times in the article that we

2007
02:04:42,661 --> 02:04:43,250
submitted,

2008
02:04:43,250 --> 02:04:48,250
reduced the Lake Sinai virus by more
than 45,000 times the deformed wing virus

2009
02:04:49,090 --> 02:04:54,090
by more than 800 times with one dose
and a doubles the lifespan of bees.

2010
02:04:55,410 --> 02:04:57,210
Uh,
think of the implications of this.

2011
02:04:58,020 --> 02:05:03,020
This means that I think I have a
window now and understanding something

2012
02:05:04,801 --> 02:05:06,480
fundamental to the foundation of nature.

2013
02:05:07,800 --> 02:05:11,940
The mycelium not only controls a
microbiomes and are deterministic and the

2014
02:05:11,941 --> 02:05:13,950
downstream evolution of ecosystems,

2015
02:05:14,430 --> 02:05:18,750
but they also control the immunological
health of the animal inhabitants because

2016
02:05:18,751 --> 02:05:23,160
the very same extracts that
reduce viruses that harm birds,

2017
02:05:23,250 --> 02:05:23,880
bird flu,

2018
02:05:23,880 --> 02:05:28,880
h five n one h three h one n
one in pigs that harm people,

2019
02:05:30,900 --> 02:05:35,010
pox viruses, herpes viruses, birds,

2020
02:05:36,150 --> 02:05:39,630
pigs,
people bs.

2021
02:05:40,200 --> 02:05:45,200
This speaks to something I think that is
very deeply profound and understanding

2022
02:05:46,590 --> 02:05:50,460
that within nature of these mice,
a little neck and it works everywhere.

2023
02:05:50,880 --> 02:05:52,980
Every tree is infused with mycelium.

2024
02:05:53,010 --> 02:05:56,070
Every vegetable you eat
is infused with fungi.

2025
02:05:56,360 --> 02:06:00,540
This is part of the
mutualistic relationship that
we have with these fungi.

2026
02:06:00,541 --> 02:06:03,300
They increases the host defense
of resistance against disease.

2027
02:06:03,600 --> 02:06:08,600
There's a plurality of fungi and such
diverse populations that create a matrix

2028
02:06:08,701 --> 02:06:12,150
of defense. We have found
that these individual species,

2029
02:06:12,151 --> 02:06:14,220
now we've tested five
different poly pore mushrooms.

2030
02:06:14,490 --> 02:06:16,860
They're all active but
to do different degrees.

2031
02:06:17,250 --> 02:06:20,970
What we have not reported
in the scientific article
that we submitted as that we

2032
02:06:20,971 --> 02:06:21,900
have one result,

2033
02:06:21,940 --> 02:06:26,760
there's over a hundred million times
reduction of these viruses with one

2034
02:06:26,761 --> 02:06:29,460
treatment.
Many of these viruses,

2035
02:06:29,490 --> 02:06:33,940
herpes viruses are known as uncle
viruses that cause cancer. Uh,

2036
02:06:33,960 --> 02:06:37,260
lots of them caused inflammation
that destabilizes the immune system.

2037
02:06:38,520 --> 02:06:41,790
This is something I think
is so critically important.

2038
02:06:42,270 --> 02:06:45,980
Everyone's talking about bad news and
we are in the six x the sixth grade

2039
02:06:45,981 --> 02:06:48,750
extinction.
Knowing that life on this planet,

2040
02:06:48,990 --> 02:06:52,740
we have 8.3 million species with
leaves losing more than 30,000 a year.

2041
02:06:53,340 --> 02:06:54,570
Do the math on a hundred years.

2042
02:06:54,571 --> 02:06:58,350
That's more than a third of the
biodiversity as unraveling all around us.

2043
02:06:58,800 --> 02:06:59,700
What can we do?

2044
02:07:00,240 --> 02:07:04,230
This is actionable ecological
solutions as paradigm shifting,

2045
02:07:04,470 --> 02:07:08,130
that scalable, ecologically
rational, economically sustainable.

2046
02:07:08,540 --> 02:07:13,140
I can all of these fungi grow on every
forest of the world and we all grew up

2047
02:07:13,141 --> 02:07:16,860
with Winnie the pooh and
everybody missed this. Now,

2048
02:07:16,861 --> 02:07:21,630
I've been issued now 10 patents,
the United States,

2049
02:07:21,631 --> 02:07:25,380
Canada, Australia, New
Zealand, and Eurasia.

2050
02:07:26,490 --> 02:07:30,300
When I first got the first patent
award for five seconds, I was excited,

2051
02:07:30,360 --> 02:07:34,950
literally, and then it became
horribly demoralized. I said,

2052
02:07:34,960 --> 02:07:38,950
you've got gotta be kidding. There's
no prior art, no one they did the,

2053
02:07:38,951 --> 02:07:43,600
the patent office is the
most massive search engines
and every language, Chinese,

2054
02:07:43,601 --> 02:07:45,010
French, Japanese, English, German.

2055
02:07:45,550 --> 02:07:50,470
And there's not a single mention anywhere
out there that bees benefit from my

2056
02:07:50,471 --> 02:07:50,771
silly,

2057
02:07:50,771 --> 02:07:55,771
I mean logically let alone reducing
the viruses that have been vectored by

2058
02:07:56,501 --> 02:07:57,334
Mites.

2059
02:07:57,670 --> 02:08:02,110
The fact that I'm the one who
discovered this is horribly depressing.

2060
02:08:02,860 --> 02:08:03,420
It means that we are,

2061
02:08:03,420 --> 02:08:07,870
we're truly neanderthals with nuclear
weapons and people talk about climate

2062
02:08:07,871 --> 02:08:11,290
change and biodiversity is a
bunch of liberal scientists.

2063
02:08:11,710 --> 02:08:13,270
Are you freaking kidding?

2064
02:08:14,110 --> 02:08:17,380
This is so fundamental to who we
are and where we've come from.

2065
02:08:18,880 --> 02:08:23,710
So I've opened sourced at the all the
developing countries, but you know,

2066
02:08:23,711 --> 02:08:28,600
Europe and Eurasia, um, uh, not, not
Asian, not South American, not Mexico,

2067
02:08:28,601 --> 02:08:33,460
Not Africa. You know, in order
for a solution to be effective,

2068
02:08:33,461 --> 02:08:35,320
it's got to be practiced in
order for it to be practice,

2069
02:08:35,321 --> 02:08:37,300
it's got to be commercially
successful in order.

2070
02:08:37,301 --> 02:08:38,560
If we're going to be
commercially successful,

2071
02:08:38,561 --> 02:08:41,260
it's got to go to market with
some protection to have your idea.

2072
02:08:42,040 --> 02:08:46,810
But the fact out that these
patents are issuing is an,

2073
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:51,280
and I'm, I'm, I made mistakes and there
my colleague out there whose eyes roll,

2074
02:08:51,670 --> 02:08:54,700
but I'm very happy to
receive several rewards,

2075
02:08:55,070 --> 02:08:57,580
one of which from the Michael [inaudible]
Society of America for bringing more

2076
02:08:57,760 --> 02:09:00,190
students in the field of
psychology than anyone in history.

2077
02:09:00,800 --> 02:09:04,890
So there are kind of schizophrenia about
me because I'm a psychedelic researcher

2078
02:09:04,891 --> 02:09:07,790
and not trained and you are bringing all
of these students into their classrooms.

2079
02:09:07,791 --> 02:09:10,750
They want to save the world. And they
said, Paul, you could have a huge problem.

2080
02:09:10,751 --> 02:09:13,330
We want to study yeast and these students
want to save the world. What did we do?

2081
02:09:13,690 --> 02:09:15,250
So, um, but,

2082
02:09:15,610 --> 02:09:19,510
so I think this is something
that is actionable solutions.

2083
02:09:20,080 --> 02:09:23,290
And I think I can make the argument,
and this is very provocative,

2084
02:09:23,830 --> 02:09:28,750
but I can make the argument that
natural products can be more powerful in

2085
02:09:28,751 --> 02:09:32,280
pharmaceuticals with a
greater bio shield of defense,

2086
02:09:33,430 --> 02:09:37,750
less toxicity and more
utility in a sustainable way.

2087
02:09:39,010 --> 02:09:41,680
And that I think is paradigm shifting.

2088
02:09:43,780 --> 02:09:45,640
I hope you're right.
I hope you're right.

2089
02:09:45,641 --> 02:09:50,530
And I look forward to learning more
about this as the discussion opens.

2090
02:09:51,100 --> 02:09:56,080
Is there anything for people listening
who are not my cologists nor future

2091
02:09:56,081 --> 02:10:00,790
mycologists who want to
help in some fashion,

2092
02:10:00,791 --> 02:10:03,700
meaning they want to
make personal decisions,

2093
02:10:03,701 --> 02:10:07,950
maybe think of policy changes
or types of support, uh,

2094
02:10:08,200 --> 02:10:13,200
that would enable them to be part of an
environmental and a systemic solution

2095
02:10:16,661 --> 02:10:21,010
rather than simply compounding the
existing problems or their new behaviors,

2096
02:10:21,011 --> 02:10:24,610
things they can do. Anything that you
would suggest to people who are listening?

2097
02:10:25,460 --> 02:10:26,750
Absolutely.
I would assemble.

2098
02:10:26,751 --> 02:10:31,750
The thing that people can do is let wood
rot give up this idea of there's a beat

2099
02:10:31,751 --> 02:10:36,751
then in yard as highly and managed
nature likes fractal faces,

2100
02:10:38,030 --> 02:10:41,360
in fact, realization of nature
at different orders of magnitude.

2101
02:10:41,720 --> 02:10:46,130
And it gives all these new issues to
microorganisms and microbiome biodiversity

2102
02:10:46,370 --> 02:10:51,230
that's critical for sustainability.
So rather than letting,

2103
02:10:51,231 --> 02:10:56,120
calling the wood off, having a running
a lot, but let raw logs rot in your,

2104
02:10:56,121 --> 02:11:00,950
in your garden and your yard mushrooms
will come up. That'll help feed the bees.

2105
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:06,000
They'll help build these fractally
intense environments that are really

2106
02:11:06,081 --> 02:11:09,580
important for biodiversity.
That's one. Uh,

2107
02:11:09,710 --> 02:11:13,160
we have a campaign for supporting
Washington state, uh, university, uh,

2108
02:11:13,180 --> 02:11:17,810
DVD at Wsu A. Dot. Be a BS. Dot.

2109
02:11:17,811 --> 02:11:19,430
wsu.edu.

2110
02:11:19,490 --> 02:11:24,320
We've raised over $3 million and
now a four be researched, uh,

2111
02:11:24,350 --> 02:11:25,250
at Wsu.

2112
02:11:25,710 --> 02:11:30,160
We have just begun to explore the rule
and he's probably per mushrooms. Uh,

2113
02:11:30,300 --> 02:11:32,730
there's hundreds of them to test.
Uh,

2114
02:11:32,870 --> 02:11:35,840
we've hit the home runs on our very
first ones. We're extremely lucky,

2115
02:11:37,130 --> 02:11:39,020
but the fact that, you know, this is,

2116
02:11:39,770 --> 02:11:43,160
it speaks to them and we can reduce
these viruses 45,000 to one with one

2117
02:11:43,161 --> 02:11:48,110
treatment. I mean, what antiviral
drug will do that, you know,

2118
02:11:48,130 --> 02:11:52,810
um, that is a complex
soup of constituents are,

2119
02:11:53,070 --> 02:11:57,770
you know, the contrast is this a
surprising, so supporting, uh, uh,

2120
02:11:57,950 --> 02:12:02,950
B company B nonprofits
joining a mushroom society.

2121
02:12:03,080 --> 02:12:03,411
These,

2122
02:12:03,411 --> 02:12:08,411
the North American mycological association
was the apparent Organization for a

2123
02:12:09,740 --> 02:12:10,280
called an Ama.

2124
02:12:10,280 --> 02:12:15,050
And their website is [inaudible]
dot org and a m Y C O. Dot.

2125
02:12:15,051 --> 02:12:19,320
O g. They have a listing of all the
local mycological societies, you know,

2126
02:12:19,630 --> 02:12:23,760
and the Canada, United States
and Mexico. Um, that's one, uh,

2127
02:12:23,780 --> 02:12:28,780
joining your B and get
involved in supporting frankly
a farmers and developing

2128
02:12:31,040 --> 02:12:36,040
biodiverse landscapes and the march
to monoculture and the marsh to the

2129
02:12:36,261 --> 02:12:41,261
industrialization of agriculture is
sacrificing the very biodiverse networks

2130
02:12:43,370 --> 02:12:45,890
that have evolved to help plants grow.

2131
02:12:46,160 --> 02:12:48,770
When you add lots of
fertilizers and insecticides,

2132
02:12:48,771 --> 02:12:53,771
you defeat the natural systems of the
mycelium that has engaged and help plants

2133
02:12:54,620 --> 02:12:58,310
for hundreds of millions of years.
When you have my psyllium helping plants,

2134
02:12:58,311 --> 02:13:03,230
you do not need external kind of can,
puts as much as fertilizers,

2135
02:13:03,270 --> 02:13:04,103
et cetera.

2136
02:13:04,330 --> 02:13:08,750
And I think there are ecologically
rational solutions to many of the problems

2137
02:13:08,751 --> 02:13:09,620
that we face today,

2138
02:13:10,790 --> 02:13:14,720
but it's really speaks to the concept
of seven generations and first peoples

2139
02:13:14,721 --> 02:13:19,721
really have this so much as a pillar
of their understanding and dealing with

2140
02:13:20,391 --> 02:13:21,224
nature.

2141
02:13:21,530 --> 02:13:25,460
We shouldn't give up this idea of making
money in the short term and we should

2142
02:13:25,461 --> 02:13:28,880
embrace the idea of
creating sustainability.

2143
02:13:28,910 --> 02:13:33,660
And the longterm true conservatives
should be conserving natural resources and

2144
02:13:33,661 --> 02:13:37,860
thinking about downstream generations.
Right now we have hungry,

2145
02:13:37,980 --> 02:13:41,850
greedy people who has,
whose morals have been hijacked.

2146
02:13:42,600 --> 02:13:46,530
Um, for whatever reason.
And I think that this,

2147
02:13:47,130 --> 02:13:52,130
this nature loving movement
with all of it's strange,

2148
02:13:52,800 --> 02:13:54,920
you know, characterizations. Yeah.

2149
02:13:54,970 --> 02:13:58,470
It really is based on something that's
fundamentally good for the Commons.

2150
02:13:59,390 --> 02:13:59,820
Well,

2151
02:13:59,820 --> 02:14:03,900
it makes me think of what you said at
the very beginning of certainly in the

2152
02:14:03,901 --> 02:14:05,310
earlier portions of this conversation,

2153
02:14:05,311 --> 02:14:08,820
which is the war against nature
is a war against your own biology.

2154
02:14:08,910 --> 02:14:13,410
And ultimately what is best for what
you're discussing is also best for us,

2155
02:14:13,411 --> 02:14:15,480
which means it's best for me.
It's best for you.

2156
02:14:15,481 --> 02:14:17,160
It's best for each
person listening to this.

2157
02:14:17,190 --> 02:14:20,250
And certainly if you're thinking
out multiple generations,

2158
02:14:20,730 --> 02:14:25,730
these problems can be
solved in a very pragmatic,

2159
02:14:27,410 --> 02:14:32,200
holistic fashion. Or they
can be compounded to the
point where they become, uh,

2160
02:14:32,520 --> 02:14:37,200
exponentially more difficult
to unwind and to solve for. Uh,

2161
02:14:37,780 --> 02:14:38,613
so,

2162
02:14:39,650 --> 02:14:41,840
and we just want to stay in the
field of mycology. I have no,

2163
02:14:41,870 --> 02:14:45,590
no other science that is underfunded,
underappreciated,

2164
02:14:45,920 --> 02:14:49,940
and yet has such an enormous
elasticity of benefits.

2165
02:14:50,450 --> 02:14:54,620
And if I was a Bill Gates or Jeff
Bezos and know I met these people,

2166
02:14:54,660 --> 02:14:57,920
it's just not part of my DNA to pitch.
And I look at them going,

2167
02:14:57,980 --> 02:15:01,400
I could do so much benefit for
hundreds of millions of people,

2168
02:15:01,790 --> 02:15:06,790
but I can't even begin to talk about
this because I don't want to pitch.

2169
02:15:07,340 --> 02:15:11,260
But thankfully my company
is soaring. And, um,

2170
02:15:11,300 --> 02:15:14,480
I'm great group a community
of individuals who are,

2171
02:15:15,080 --> 02:15:18,980
who believe in this, who
see the results and, um,

2172
02:15:19,400 --> 02:15:24,140
Michael Pollan's book and fantastic
fungi and you know, you're,

2173
02:15:24,230 --> 02:15:28,280
you're in support, et cetera. It's to
help spread this message. But, you know,

2174
02:15:28,281 --> 02:15:32,510
I'm 63 years of age and I want to die
with a smile on my face because it's a

2175
02:15:32,511 --> 02:15:34,520
heritage that we leave,
not,

2176
02:15:34,521 --> 02:15:37,820
not the material possessions that
we own during this short lifetime.

2177
02:15:38,180 --> 02:15:41,240
We all need to create legacies.
There were our names,

2178
02:15:41,241 --> 02:15:45,170
will we heralded in the future as a
person who cared more about other people

2179
02:15:45,171 --> 02:15:50,000
then they cared about themselves. That
is truly a Christian, a Buddhists,

2180
02:15:50,400 --> 02:15:55,400
uh, a zen like attitude. And I think that,

2181
02:15:55,401 --> 02:16:00,110
um, it's time for people to take
action. We need a revolution.

2182
02:16:01,430 --> 02:16:05,470
It is time. It's time for people to
take action. Could not agree more. Uh,

2183
02:16:05,690 --> 02:16:08,690
and you've given a number
of recommendations that I
will link to in the show

2184
02:16:08,691 --> 02:16:12,230
notes as usual. So everyone
listening, everything we've discussed,

2185
02:16:12,350 --> 02:16:16,310
all the links to everything
that US certainly that I
can track down and that my

2186
02:16:16,311 --> 02:16:17,021
team can track down.

2187
02:16:17,021 --> 02:16:20,570
We'll be in the show notes at
tim.blog/podcast for this episode.

2188
02:16:21,230 --> 02:16:24,650
And Paul,
you've been very generous with your time.

2189
02:16:24,651 --> 02:16:29,060
People can find you@fungi.com
fungi.net host defense.com

2190
02:16:30,610 --> 02:16:35,380
and on social media on Instagram.
You're Paul Stamets, Facebook,

2191
02:16:35,381 --> 02:16:37,270
Paul Stamets,
Youtube with Paul Stamets.

2192
02:16:37,300 --> 02:16:40,720
Is there a a for people who want
to know where to go for what?

2193
02:16:40,750 --> 02:16:44,680
Is there one best place
for certain things?

2194
02:16:44,770 --> 02:16:48,520
A certain best place to say hello? If
people want to reach out to you somehow,

2195
02:16:49,370 --> 02:16:52,080
oh, that's a complicated like,
did you tell him, you know,

2196
02:16:52,920 --> 02:16:56,990
we get so many people, why in
the contact us? But for the, I'm,

2197
02:16:57,070 --> 02:17:00,330
I want to feed some of the researchers
out there and people who want to get into

2198
02:17:00,360 --> 02:17:02,820
some of the detailed research articles.

2199
02:17:03,060 --> 02:17:06,480
We have a website that we populate
called mushroom risotto, mushroom,

2200
02:17:06,481 --> 02:17:09,570
references.com,
mushroom references.com.

2201
02:17:09,630 --> 02:17:13,490
I several hundred peer reviewed articles,
um,

2202
02:17:13,680 --> 02:17:18,680
that we linked to the abstracts that
talk about their most recent research of

2203
02:17:18,690 --> 02:17:23,520
the, uh, from mycelium. Um,
and as I'm and deep dive,

2204
02:17:23,521 --> 02:17:28,521
many physicians are unfamiliar and because
the public expects that there will be

2205
02:17:29,071 --> 02:17:32,670
experts about everything on health,
they're actually quite ignorant.

2206
02:17:33,060 --> 02:17:37,900
And so I have found this has been a
challenge is why I speak to a lot of, uh,

2207
02:17:37,960 --> 02:17:42,450
academic and a lot of academic conferences
that a lot of medical conferences is

2208
02:17:42,451 --> 02:17:46,830
that there is a desperate need by
these physicians to get on board and be

2209
02:17:46,831 --> 02:17:51,820
familiarized with some of the latest
research. So, um, but otherwise, you know,

2210
02:17:51,840 --> 02:17:55,710
fungi.com is a hub and we
have a resource section, uh,

2211
02:17:55,730 --> 02:17:59,970
at the end on that website that links
to many other, uh, nonprofits, uh,

2212
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:04,180
lots of other resources, uh,
including, uh, Cornell University.

2213
02:18:04,181 --> 02:18:08,910
And I said particularly a good
one. Um, there is, uh, Miko Web,

2214
02:18:09,210 --> 02:18:11,040
which is extremely good. M, y.

2215
02:18:11,070 --> 02:18:15,420
K. O. W. E. B.

2216
02:18:15,420 --> 02:18:16,980
Michael Web's a really good one.
And I'm,

2217
02:18:16,981 --> 02:18:20,040
so there's a lot of my colleges out
there that are genuinely really,

2218
02:18:20,041 --> 02:18:23,160
really good people,
but they have,

2219
02:18:23,161 --> 02:18:28,161
I've in a sense have tasked them with
expectations greater than some of which

2220
02:18:28,800 --> 02:18:33,020
they can deliver. And I apologize for
that, but time is short, is every,

2221
02:18:33,030 --> 02:18:36,720
it's so important that everybody gets a
aboard the starship and, and try to do.

2222
02:18:36,721 --> 02:18:37,554
Good.

2223
02:18:38,530 --> 02:18:42,140
Well thank you so much
for your time today. Paul.

2224
02:18:42,141 --> 02:18:46,220
This has been really fun for
me and I'm sure for for many,

2225
02:18:46,221 --> 02:18:47,450
many people who are listening.

2226
02:18:47,870 --> 02:18:52,670
Is there anything else that you would
like to share or recommend before we wrap

2227
02:18:52,671 --> 02:18:56,270
up at least to this,
this first conversation on the podcast?

2228
02:18:57,950 --> 02:18:58,783
Yeah.

2229
02:18:58,980 --> 02:18:59,813
Um,

2230
02:19:00,540 --> 02:19:04,290
if you see somebody being
abused or somebody being shamed,

2231
02:19:05,420 --> 02:19:06,253
stop up,

2232
02:19:07,510 --> 02:19:11,250
extend a hand of generosity and
show people a better way of acting

2233
02:19:12,570 --> 02:19:17,190
here, here. So that is an
excellent way to wrap up. And, uh,

2234
02:19:17,310 --> 02:19:20,340
once again, Paul, a real pleasure
to spend this time with you.

2235
02:19:20,820 --> 02:19:23,220
I have pages and pages and pages of notes,

2236
02:19:23,690 --> 02:19:28,070
follow ups for myself and
for my family and also many

2237
02:19:28,070 --> 02:19:29,540
different avenues that I want to explore.

2238
02:19:30,020 --> 02:19:35,020
And to everyone listening to find the
show notes at tim.blog/podcast and until

2239
02:19:35,691 --> 02:19:40,250
next time, keep experimenting
and express some kindness.

2240
02:19:40,280 --> 02:19:45,020
It is time to take action. So get off of
the ear phones, get off of the ear buds,

2241
02:19:45,021 --> 02:19:49,340
get off of the pages in those
books that you might consume,

2242
02:19:49,341 --> 02:19:53,600
one after the other, and actually taping.
Take a meaningful step forward, uh, with,

2243
02:19:53,601 --> 02:19:57,830
with somehow bending the reality
around you in a positive direction.

2244
02:19:58,190 --> 02:20:02,720
And until next time, thanks
for listening. Hey guys,

2245
02:20:02,721 --> 02:20:06,680
this is Tim again. Just a few more
things before you take off. Number one,

2246
02:20:06,920 --> 02:20:11,840
this is five bullet Friday.
Do you want to get a short email from me?

2247
02:20:11,870 --> 02:20:16,010
Would you enjoy getting a short email
from me every Friday that provides a

2248
02:20:16,011 --> 02:20:19,580
little more soul of fun before the
weekend and five bullet Friday is a very

2249
02:20:19,581 --> 02:20:24,530
short email where I share the coolest
things I found or that I've been pondering

2250
02:20:24,531 --> 02:20:28,220
over the week. That could include
favorite new albums that I've discovered.

2251
02:20:28,221 --> 02:20:31,670
It could include Gizmos and gadgets
and all sorts of weird shit that I've

2252
02:20:31,671 --> 02:20:35,990
somehow dug up in the, uh, the
world of the esoteric as I do.

2253
02:20:36,260 --> 02:20:41,260
It could include a few articles that
I've read and that I've shared with my

2254
02:20:41,931 --> 02:20:44,660
close friends for instance.
And it's very short.

2255
02:20:44,720 --> 02:20:49,700
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness
before you head off for the weekend.

2256
02:20:49,790 --> 02:20:51,950
So if you want to receive that,
check it out.

02:21:08,090 --> 02:21:11,900
I've used audible for many years and I've
several audio books to recommend right

2263
02:21:11,901 --> 02:21:15,590
off the bat. If you're looking for a new
one ready player, one by Ernest Cline,

2264
02:21:16,070 --> 02:21:18,350
he may have heard of it.
The Tao of Seneca Seneca.

2265
02:21:18,410 --> 02:21:22,280
If you want to hear my favorite collection
of letters of all time as well as the

2266
02:21:22,281 --> 02:21:24,050
graveyard book by Neil Gaiman,

2267
02:21:24,110 --> 02:21:29,110
which is a fiction book I
used to reintroduce nonfiction
purists to the beauty

2268
02:21:30,621 --> 02:21:33,860
and truth and enjoyment,
affection graveyard book.

2269
02:21:33,950 --> 02:21:37,190
It is incredible and I liked the
version that Neil reads himself,

2270
02:21:37,191 --> 02:21:40,460
but the entire ensemble cast is also fun.

2271
02:21:40,970 --> 02:21:45,080
Audible members get a credit every month,
good for any audio book in the store,

2272
02:21:45,140 --> 02:21:48,290
regardless of price and unused
credits roll over to the next month.

2273
02:21:48,560 --> 02:21:51,530
So if you didn't like your audio
book, no problem. You can exchange it,

2274
02:21:51,560 --> 02:21:55,580
no questions asked. Plus, your books
are yours to keep with audible.

2275
02:21:55,850 --> 02:21:57,590
You can go back and relisten anytime,

2276
02:21:57,890 --> 02:22:01,490
even if you cancel your membership
and for some books, again,

2277
02:22:01,580 --> 02:22:04,400
graveyard book by Neil Gaiman,
I've listened to many, many times.

2278
02:22:04,400 --> 02:22:06,980
You may even just start over as soon
as you finish it the first time.

2279
02:22:07,440 --> 02:22:10,760
Autobot also helps you to listen to more
books by letting you switch seamlessly

2280
02:22:10,761 --> 02:22:13,430
between devices.
Picking up exactly where you left off,

2281
02:22:13,790 --> 02:22:15,620
whether it's on your phone,
through your car,

2282
02:22:15,621 --> 02:22:18,140
from a tablet or at
home on an Amazon Echo,

2283
02:22:18,141 --> 02:22:20,360
whatever you can get
through tons of books,

2284
02:22:20,540 --> 02:22:22,700
hands and eyes free while
doing almost anything.

2285
02:22:23,150 --> 02:22:24,920
So that is part of the beauty of audio.

2286
02:22:25,070 --> 02:22:27,900
It is a secondary activity when
you're walking the dog cooking,

2287
02:22:27,930 --> 02:22:28,763
whatever it might be.

2288
02:22:29,430 --> 02:22:32,130

and business information providers.

2292
02:22:41,940 --> 02:22:42,601
Maybe that's what I am,

2293
02:22:42,601 --> 02:22:46,980
a business information provider and right

episode is brought to you by Peloton,

2299
02:23:11,881 --> 02:23:13,560
which I've been using
probably for about a year now.

2300
02:23:13,830 --> 02:23:17,790
Peloton is a cutting edge indoor cycling
bike that brings live studio classes

2301
02:23:17,791 --> 02:23:20,900
right into your home. You can also
do on demand, which is what I do.

2302
02:23:20,910 --> 02:23:24,660
We'll come back to that so you don't have
to worry about fitting classes into a

2303
02:23:24,661 --> 02:23:28,620
busy schedule or making it to a studio
or gym with a hectic or unpredictable

2304
02:23:28,621 --> 02:23:30,240
commute.
I for instance,

2305
02:23:30,270 --> 02:23:34,410
have a Peloton bike right in my master
bedroom at home and it's one of the first

2306
02:23:34,411 --> 02:23:38,100
things I do. Many mornings I
wake up and meditate for a bit.

2307
02:23:38,430 --> 02:23:42,690
Then I knock out a short 20 minute ride
in my undies. Hard to do that at the gym,

2308
02:23:42,930 --> 02:23:45,420
take a shower and I'm in higher
gear for the rest of the day.

2309
02:23:45,510 --> 02:23:49,230
It's really convenient and has become
something that I look forward to see.

2310
02:23:49,231 --> 02:23:51,390
You have a lot of options
for one if you'd like.

2311
02:23:51,391 --> 02:23:54,900
You can ride live with thousands of
other writers across the country on an

2312
02:23:54,901 --> 02:23:56,970
interactive leaderboard
to keep you motivated.

2313
02:23:57,240 --> 02:24:02,240
There are also up to 14 new classes added
every day with more than 8,000 classes

2314
02:24:02,491 --> 02:24:07,470
on demand and you can pick
based on length, 45 minutes,
20 minutes, whatever music,

2315
02:24:07,471 --> 02:24:11,730
hip hop, rock and roll or say low impact
versus high intensity or interval.

2316
02:24:12,090 --> 02:24:16,920
You can pick the class structure and
style that works for you and in my case I

2317
02:24:16,921 --> 02:24:21,090
quite like Matt [inaudible] and I tend
to do on demand and listened to a lot of

2318
02:24:21,091 --> 02:24:23,370
and watch many of the same
classes over and over,

2319
02:24:23,670 --> 02:24:26,280
but I'm kind of promiscuous and also
enjoy classes from a lot of the other

2320
02:24:26,281 --> 02:24:27,114
instructors.

2321
02:24:27,330 --> 02:24:31,410
They have Peloton and amazing roster of
incredible instructors in New York City

2322
02:24:31,590 --> 02:24:34,770
with a whole range of styles
and personalities so you
can find what you're in

2323
02:24:34,771 --> 02:24:35,604
the mood for.

2324
02:24:35,640 --> 02:24:39,570
You also get real time metrics that you
can use to track your performance over

2325
02:24:39,571 --> 02:24:44,430
time and that will help, I would say,
catalyze you to beat your personal best.

2326
02:24:44,431 --> 02:24:47,490
Now that all sounds good, right?
Gamification, Yada, Yada, Yada.

2327
02:24:47,700 --> 02:24:51,750
I didn't think that it would work
for me or in any way incentivize me,

2328
02:24:51,751 --> 02:24:55,290
but they really 100% hit the
nail on the head. I was very,

2329
02:24:55,291 --> 02:25:00,000
very impressed with how motivating
it was and it worked tremendously.

2330
02:25:00,060 --> 02:25:04,020
T keep me pushing, uh, which quite
honestly takes a fair amount.

2331
02:25:04,021 --> 02:25:07,830
I can get quite lazy, particularly
with anything that edges on endurance,

2332
02:25:07,831 --> 02:25:12,120
which is kind of more than five reps
of anything for me. So check it out.
