00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,410
Hello Ladies and gentlemen,
this is Tim Ferriss.

2
00:00:02,411 --> 00:00:04,600
Welcome to another episode
of the Tim Ferriss show.

3
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:09,460
What you're about to hear is part three
of a three part conversation with Kevin

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,440
Kelly, Co, founder of wired magazine,

5
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:14,560
bestselling author all around
fascinating human being.

6
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:16,630
If you didn't catch the first two parts,

7
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:20,620
you might want to do that before
venturing in, but if not, no fear.

8
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,150
We answer a lot of questions.

9
00:00:22,151 --> 00:00:25,630
It's a conversation you can pretty
much dip in and dip out as you'd like.

10
00:00:25,631 --> 00:00:29,410
So if you don't mind, your stories is more
of a jigsaw puzzle, then by all means,

11
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:33,430
keep on listening. So without
further ado, please enjoy part three.

12
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,850
The final part of the Tim
Ferriss show with Kevin Kelly,

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,960
and thank you for listening

14
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,830
at this altitude, I can flat out for a
half mile before my hands start shaking.

15
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,750
Also,

16
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:51,960
I'm a cybernetic organism living

17
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,140
above too.

18
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,560
Perhaps jump into some rapid
fire questions and they
don't have to even be rapid

19
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,040
fire quest or the quiet, just some fire
questions. The questions will be rapid.

20
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:13,810
The answers can be as short
or as long as you'd like.

21
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:19,960
What book or books have you do you gift
or have gifted the most other people

22
00:01:19,961 --> 00:01:21,190
outside of your own books?

23
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:27,060
There is a short graphic novel by Daniel
Pink Cold Juco and it's career counsel

24
00:01:33,491 --> 00:01:36,520
advice. It's aimed at young
people. It's a graphic novel.

25
00:01:36,521 --> 00:01:37,510
It's a cartoon and basically,

26
00:01:37,511 --> 00:01:40,480
and it's Andy young people is trying
to teach them how to be become

27
00:01:40,481 --> 00:01:45,481
indispensable and I've given that away
to young people because it's for me the

28
00:01:46,181 --> 00:01:50,260
best summary of it. Again, it's
not like how to become successful.

29
00:01:50,261 --> 00:01:52,240
It's how to become indispensable to,

30
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:57,000
that's right. It's a adventures of Johnny
Bunko or something like that. Yeah, yeah,

31
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:00,620
that's right. That's right. I have that
on my bookshelf back in San Francisco.

32
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:01,160
In fact,
yeah.

33
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,370
If you know a young person who is
just starting out, hand him that book,

34
00:02:04,371 --> 00:02:09,020
it's very easy for them to read cause
graphic novel. It's non nonthreatening.

35
00:02:09,021 --> 00:02:14,021
It's fun and it will give us
like five great principals for,

36
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:19,730
I'm starting out and helping them kind
of orient themselves as a start working

37
00:02:20,371 --> 00:02:21,560
in,
in the working life.

38
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,950
For someone who's facing a lot of
the same questions, let's just say,

39
00:02:24,951 --> 00:02:28,610
so you have graduates asking the
what should I do? Why am I here?

40
00:02:28,611 --> 00:02:29,390
What am I good at?

41
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:32,930
If we fast forward to say for the sake
of argument and mid thirties right?

42
00:02:32,931 --> 00:02:36,950
People in Middle Age hitting
that particular point.

43
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,470
Are there any books that you
would recommend they read?

44
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:44,950
There is a book that I'm recommending
like cal Newport is called so good they

45
00:02:45,111 --> 00:02:46,010
can't ignore you.

46
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:51,730
This changed my mind because I had
kind of bought into the kind of new age

47
00:02:52,011 --> 00:02:54,110
California dogma,
a follow your bliss,

48
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:58,640
you know the money will follow and he
makes a really good argument and convinced

49
00:02:58,641 --> 00:03:03,641
me actually not very good advice that
what you really want to do is to master

50
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:10,240
something and to use your mastering
of something as a way to get to your

51
00:03:10,241 --> 00:03:13,750
passion.
So if you start with just passion,

52
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:17,650
it's sort of paralyzing because,
and I know this from my own kids,

53
00:03:17,651 --> 00:03:22,651
they have 18 they really don't
know what they're passionate about.

54
00:03:22,721 --> 00:03:26,560
I mean some people are lucky enough
to know and a lot of people aren't.

55
00:03:26,561 --> 00:03:27,040
So this is,

56
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,400
this is a book for people who don't
kind of really know what they're really

57
00:03:30,401 --> 00:03:30,880
excellent at.

58
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,480
I don't really know what
they're passionate about
and his premise is that you

59
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:37,600
master something almost anything at all.

60
00:03:37,601 --> 00:03:42,601
It just something you master and you use
that mastery to kind of move you into a

61
00:03:43,241 --> 00:03:46,840
place where you can begin to have passion
and that you kind of keep recycling

62
00:03:46,841 --> 00:03:50,530
that the way you find your passion is
through mastery rather than the other way

63
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:50,831
around,

64
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:53,800
which is people think that they're going
to get their mastery through passion

65
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,860
and I kind of believe that former,

66
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,820
you know that Matt and the
passion would lead to mastery,

67
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:01,750
but after thinking about it,
looking at his examples in his argument,

68
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,520
I'm pretty sure that for these,

69
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:09,580
for most people you can
get to your passion through
mastery and that would also

70
00:04:10,211 --> 00:04:14,560
give you a currency or a lever
to use in getting to that point.

71
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:19,180
Exactly. Excellent. Do you have
a favorite fiction book? Yes.

72
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:22,300
Fantastic.
I usually don't get one answer,

73
00:04:22,301 --> 00:04:27,290
and this is great shot to Ron
shots.

74
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,930
It might take me a way to explain this,
but it's,

75
00:04:29,931 --> 00:04:33,760
it's a one author wrote one book
cause it's very autobiographical.

76
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:39,010
The premise of the book and the author's
life seems completely incredulous and

77
00:04:39,011 --> 00:04:40,240
kind of almost Hollywoodish.

78
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:45,310
But what you get from it and the
where it's set, it's set in India,

79
00:04:45,311 --> 00:04:50,311
sets in the slums of India
and you get a credibly vivid,

80
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:56,160
immersive deep and in some
ways uplifting view of India.

81
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:04,030
And the underworld in India
ended that part of Asia.

82
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:09,430
And the, the main protagonist is
this very interesting zen criminal.

83
00:05:09,431 --> 00:05:14,431
He's sort of a coyote trickster
blend of someone who is,

84
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,181
you know,

85
00:05:16,181 --> 00:05:21,181
he does bad things but at the same time
he's sorry about it and he has a kind of

86
00:05:22,631 --> 00:05:26,320
a cosmic perspective.
It's very, very unusual.

87
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,640
But it's a long book and I actually
recommend that people are going to try to,

88
00:05:30,641 --> 00:05:33,580
is it you actually to get the
audible version listened to it.

89
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:37,960
It runs like, you know, on and on. But
it'd be one of those books that you,

90
00:05:37,961 --> 00:05:41,140
that you wish will never end. And I'll
just tell you the beginning of it,

91
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:45,610
which is that, and this is the
true part, which is that the guy,

92
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:50,380
the author became a bank robber in
New Zealand. He was hooked on drugs,

93
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,520
started robbing banks,

94
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:56,790
was eventually caught and escaped from
prison and he made his way to the slums

95
00:05:56,891 --> 00:05:59,960
of India where because he had a medical
kit, he was treated as a doctor,

96
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:05,210
gotten involved and hooked on drugs in
India. I got involved with the mafia,

97
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:09,260
was put into prison,
tortured, left, abandoned,

98
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:12,360
nobody knew and even in there
started writing a book. He,

99
00:06:12,361 --> 00:06:17,000
we have to wrote this book. They ripped
it up, destroyed it. He was recruited,

100
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:21,910
found a guru, an Afghany was recruited
and Ima Jean was fighting their kids.

101
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:25,310
Entire company was wiped out. I mean
this, that's just the beginning.

102
00:06:25,311 --> 00:06:26,180
That's like the first day.

103
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:32,060
It's really interesting that you would
bring him Sean from for those people who

104
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:36,170
haven't heard of Josh Waitzkin.
I also had him on this podcast.

105
00:06:36,171 --> 00:06:39,860
Josh was the basis for searching for
Bobby Fischer at the book and the movie

106
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,790
Worldclass Chess Player,
also very deep soulful guy.

107
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:47,180
And this is one of his favorite
books as well. Oh yeah, you would,

108
00:06:47,181 --> 00:06:50,150
you would love Josh sometime.
I'll have to put you guys in touch,

109
00:06:50,151 --> 00:06:52,100
but any favorite documentaries?

110
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,370
Well,
now you're,

111
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:58,371
you've asked the wrong question because
I have a site called true films for the

112
00:06:59,221 --> 00:07:04,221
past 10 years I have reviewed the best
documentaries and actually have a book

113
00:07:04,481 --> 00:07:08,020
called true films, which is the 200
best documentaries that you should see.

114
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:11,100
Oh my God, no kidding. Wow. You
have no idea how timely this is.

115
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:13,890
So it's to a t r u e films stuck up

116
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:15,820
true films.
And so I,

117
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:20,110
there are a couple of films that
I would say have sort of universal

118
00:07:20,111 --> 00:07:21,400
appreciation.
Like you know,

119
00:07:21,401 --> 00:07:24,150
they might have like a rating of like a
hundred or rotten tomatoes or something.

120
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:29,170
So the one documentary that I think
everybody that I know who've seen it,

121
00:07:29,171 --> 00:07:32,200
his love to his man on wire,
such a good movie,

122
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:36,250
transcendent,
it's just a beautiful movie.

123
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:40,540
It's based on the fact that
this guy basically he's
going to walk to twin towers.

124
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:41,770
I mean he,
the moment was,

125
00:07:41,771 --> 00:07:46,210
he was like 14 year old kid in France
was at a dentist office looking at a

126
00:07:46,211 --> 00:07:47,470
magazine and he saw that they were,

127
00:07:47,471 --> 00:07:52,240
had plans to build this twin tower in
New York and he saw those two twin towers

128
00:07:52,241 --> 00:07:56,590
and he said, I need to walk between
them. He didn't know how to type,

129
00:07:56,591 --> 00:07:58,480
walk the towers and not been built.

130
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:02,950
He was already planning this thing and
he was filming himself the whole way.

131
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:04,410
Yeah.
So amazing.

132
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:07,740
Okay. And so he does, he does it.
And how he does it is amazing.

133
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:12,930
So another great documentary that I
love because it's very unusual among

134
00:08:12,931 --> 00:08:17,730
documentaries and films, the villain
side of the whole thing as well,

135
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:19,350
which is King of calm.

136
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:23,180
Oh I haven't, this has been recommended
to me. I still have not seen this.

137
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:28,240
King of Kong is about a guy
who becomes the video game,

138
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:31,660
arcade game, King of Kong.
He becomes the champion.

139
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:37,170
But he is basically competing against
this cabal of people who were trying suits

140
00:08:38,221 --> 00:08:42,400
of vert him. And are doing all kinds
of really terrible things to stop,

141
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:43,990
which is all on film.

142
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:48,490
And so here's this really kind of
Midwest and really lovable guy and you're

143
00:08:48,491 --> 00:08:49,480
rooting for him the whole time.

144
00:08:49,481 --> 00:08:53,230
While these really sleazy guys
are trying to take him down,

145
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:56,130
it's just fantastic.
I have to watch that.

146
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:01,170
So that's the second one. The third one
is one that's not so well known but a,

147
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,500
it's called state of mind.

148
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:07,600
And it's about the
spectacles in North Korea,

149
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:12,700
which these two filmmakers had access to
when they filed several different young

150
00:09:12,701 --> 00:09:15,070
athletes who were practicing
for the spectical.

151
00:09:15,071 --> 00:09:18,370
And in the spectacles of course
what it is is people are pixels.

152
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:22,390
You know they have these like
huge stadium size things in there,

153
00:09:22,391 --> 00:09:25,780
like a little robots that are cogs in
this machine, which is like perfect.

154
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:29,650
So you can imagine like you know like
a picture that's made up of pixels,

155
00:09:29,651 --> 00:09:32,830
but every pixel is actually was a little
boy or girl holding up a card colored

156
00:09:32,831 --> 00:09:37,180
cards in sequence. So these things
move, which means that, you know,

157
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,880
there's not a pixel missing. So let me
that nobody's sick is like, you know this,

158
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:44,020
you're not allowed to be sick.
You can't make a mistake at all,

159
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:47,170
and it's getting inside of North Korea,

160
00:09:47,171 --> 00:09:50,890
which turns out to be a nationwide cult,

161
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:55,600
and I think that in 50
years when they're gone,

162
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:57,520
nobody will believe that
that was even possible.

163
00:09:57,521 --> 00:09:59,800
And this documentary will
be there saying, no, no, no.

164
00:09:59,801 --> 00:10:03,400
They really was a nationwide called
and they really did believe this.

165
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:06,280
It really is amazing to
see what's going on there.

166
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,640
All right, well I know, I know what
I'm doing for the next few days.

167
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:10,620
Next few evenings.

168
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,090
Well, I could go on unfortunately
because I have a lot of them,

169
00:10:13,091 --> 00:10:16,660
but go to the truth. I only
review when's it are? Great.

170
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:19,960
So I don't do I just
saying these are fantastic.

171
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,840
Oh Man. All right. I've
been looking for this.

172
00:10:21,841 --> 00:10:24,150
I cannot believe that I'm
only learning this now.

173
00:10:24,151 --> 00:10:25,260
I'm kind of embarrassed about that.

174
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:28,680
When you think of the word
or hear the word successful,

175
00:10:28,681 --> 00:10:30,300
who's the first person who comes to mind?

176
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,113
Jesus.

177
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,010
All right.
Why would you say that?

178
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,190
Well,

179
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:40,190
there aren't that many people who've
left their mark on as many people in the

180
00:10:40,591 --> 00:10:45,390
world as he has. I think what he
was up to, what he was doing, his,

181
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:50,280
you know, fastly been
twisted, misunderstood,

182
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,110
whatever word you want. But
nonetheless, what's remarkable is,

183
00:10:55,111 --> 00:10:56,880
and here's the guy who
didn't write anything.

184
00:10:56,881 --> 00:11:00,520
So I think success is also overrated.

185
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,380
Love you to elaborate on that.

186
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:08,480
Greatness is overrated. A lot of, you
know, I mentioned big numbers but she's,

187
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,460
but it's more of the impact
they had on people's lives,

188
00:11:11,461 --> 00:11:16,461
but I think we tend to have an image of
success that's so much been skewed by

189
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:21,630
our current media.
It's like our sense of beauty.

190
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:25,200
I mean it's sort of like in terms of
all possibilities is in a very small,

191
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:28,800
narrow, defined his own kind of
ritualistic in a certain sense.

192
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:33,510
I think our idea of success is
often today. It means you know,

193
00:11:33,511 --> 00:11:38,310
somebody who has a lot of money or who
has a lot of fame or who has some of

194
00:11:38,311 --> 00:11:43,311
these other trappings which we assign
but I think can be successful in by being

195
00:11:43,591 --> 00:11:48,591
true to and kind of being the most
you that you could possibly be.

196
00:11:48,691 --> 00:11:51,900
And I think that's what I think of
is one of the things that Jesus,

197
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:56,680
whether you take them as just a historical
character or anything beyond was,

198
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:00,280
was about, he certainly wasn't imitating
anybody. I mean put it that way.

199
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,070
I mean I think that's the,

200
00:12:02,071 --> 00:12:06,670
the great temptation that people
have is they want to be someone else,

201
00:12:06,671 --> 00:12:09,020
which is basically they want to be
in someone else's movie. You know,

202
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:11,070
they want to be the best rockstar.

203
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,770
And there's so many of those already
that you can only went up imitating

204
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,750
somebody in that,
in that slot.

205
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:19,870
And I think to me the success
is like you make your own slot,

206
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:24,900
you have a new slot that didn't exist
before and I think that's of course it

207
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:27,760
would use as many others were doing.
But it was there were kind of making,

208
00:12:27,761 --> 00:12:31,600
making a new slot and
that's really hard to do.

209
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:36,070
But I think that's what I chalk up
as success is you made a new slot.

210
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:37,480
What is your new slot?

211
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,670
You knew, you knew that was
guy who says I'm successful.

212
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,360
I mean I'm trying to not
make any assumptions here.

213
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,540
Or what would be your slot?

214
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:53,170
Well, my slide would be Kevin Kelly.
I mean, I mean that's the whole thing.

215
00:12:53,171 --> 00:12:58,171
It's not going to be like a career or you
would really ideally be something that

216
00:12:58,421 --> 00:13:02,860
was, you had no, no imitators. I mean
you would be who you are and that's,

217
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:06,740
that is success actually in some
senses is you didn't entertain anybody.

218
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,910
No one else had mutated you afterwards.

219
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,410
So you know, in a certain sense you
have, if you become an adjective,

220
00:13:14,411 --> 00:13:17,890
that's a good sign. Right? So
I think success is actually,

221
00:13:17,891 --> 00:13:22,000
you kind of make your own path. If they're
calling you a successful entrepreneur,

222
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:27,001
then to me that's not the best kind of
success because you're being confined to

223
00:13:27,131 --> 00:13:29,500
the category, right? You're in a category.

224
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:32,590
If you could change one thing
about yourself, what would it

225
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,580
I could sing. You would
like to sing? Yeah.

226
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:42,610
I seem to be unable to carry a tune and
I can't remember when my wife can hear

227
00:13:43,191 --> 00:13:46,620
something once and she can
just sing it back later. I,

228
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:50,720
I could hear the same song I have here
at the same song and I couldn't tell you

229
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,080
three notes of it.
I'm sure because I'm a Tim Ferriss Fan.

230
00:13:54,081 --> 00:13:58,180
I'm sure I could train myself to
eat that. I know I could, but I,

231
00:13:58,181 --> 00:14:01,850
I guess I haven't and it
would be something that I
have to really work at and I

232
00:14:01,851 --> 00:14:05,930
haven't, but I have trouble
carrying it tunes, staying
in tune, remembering a tune.

233
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:09,530
I love music and I appreciate it,

234
00:14:09,531 --> 00:14:12,730
but in terms of actually
singing and or play,

235
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:16,160
I don't play an instrument so maybe
I would say a little easier for me.

236
00:14:16,161 --> 00:14:17,480
That'd be something nice.

237
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,680
Have you taken lessons or
attempted to take lessons? No,

238
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:24,790
I got it just in the spirit of trade.

239
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:28,330
I've recently started exploring
hand drumming with Jim,

240
00:14:28,331 --> 00:14:30,190
Jim Bays and different types of drums.

241
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,730
If anyone out there can
get me a pan art hang,

242
00:14:33,731 --> 00:14:35,200
I would really love to hear from you.

243
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,320
Those of you that will mean nothing
to most people are hearing this.

244
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:43,680
The research that has peaked my curiosity
most recently and of course you don't

245
00:14:43,691 --> 00:14:45,550
want to run out and just
start swallowing these things,

246
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:50,080
but there's a common auntie
epilepsy drug called Valproate,

247
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:55,140
which apparently has some implications
for opening a window for achieving

248
00:14:56,001 --> 00:15:00,820
perfect pitch in mature adults.
Very fascinating stuff. Wow. Uh,

249
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:05,510
south I five. I do any
experiments with that. I will,
I will certainly report back.

250
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:08,200
Well now that you've talked about it,
not the drug part,

251
00:15:08,201 --> 00:15:11,130
but I did remember I did take one
class that you mentioned the drums.

252
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:15,350
It took a one class at a, an adult summer
camp, which are highly recommended.

253
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:20,260
If your kids go to camp, you should go
with them. And it was a steel drum. Oh,

254
00:15:20,261 --> 00:15:23,470
cool. Course. And I
love that. So like you,

255
00:15:23,471 --> 00:15:26,220
I think if I did take up an instrument
it would be drums of some sort.

256
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:29,410
Because of that, I seem to respond
to it and I did pretty good for the,

257
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:31,870
for the intro course on steel drumming,

258
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,890
I find percussion to be so primal.

259
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:39,830
Just satisfied some type of need
that probably predates, yes,

260
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:43,740
verbal communication even certainly
certainly written notes. Right.

261
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,080
Is your inner cave man just respond?

262
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,440
Are there any particular, let's just
say in the first two hours of your day,

263
00:15:50,441 --> 00:15:55,441
any particular morning rituals or
habits you have that when performed

264
00:15:56,741 --> 00:16:01,330
consistently you find produce better
days for you and I'm leaving better days

265
00:16:01,331 --> 00:16:02,410
undefined on purpose,

266
00:16:02,411 --> 00:16:07,411
but I love studying mornings and or
what people do when they wake up.

267
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,680
What time do you wake up?

268
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:13,240
Are there any particular habits or
rituals that you find contribute to better

269
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:13,420
days?

270
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:17,990
Yeah. Yeah. I'm a very good sleeper.
I don't sleep a lot these days.

271
00:16:17,991 --> 00:16:22,250
I get up at seven 30
and I have some rituals,

272
00:16:22,251 --> 00:16:26,280
but I don't vary them enough maybe
to to know whether they are a,

273
00:16:26,281 --> 00:16:29,540
I'm not a morning person. Okay. To begin
with. You're not a morning person. Well,

274
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:31,820
I mean, well, the fact that
you don't vary them as perfect

275
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:37,400
necessarily optimized in any way or,
or I can't tell which is better,

276
00:16:37,401 --> 00:16:42,401
but for better or worse when the first
things I do is I read the paper version

277
00:16:43,251 --> 00:16:46,370
of the New York Times,
it's a kind of like a,

278
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,410
so what I call a guilty pleasure.

279
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:53,860
I don't know whether that makes me
better at anything else I do, but, um,

280
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:57,170
I don't drink coffee or anything
and this is sort of my, um,

281
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:00,740
it's a ritual and when I'm not here,
I don't read it.

282
00:17:00,741 --> 00:17:05,360
So it's like I don't miss it. It's kind
of a hearing. Yes. But like if I'm here,

283
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:07,340
it's like I got to do it. I
don't know. It's kind of weird.

284
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:10,570
Is that immediately after waking you
read the paper or is there anything

285
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:14,040
can just about,
I just kind of in my pajamas,

286
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:18,480
I walk out to the front gate and I
pick it up and um, I read it. I mean,

287
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,890
and I don't read all of it.

288
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:24,920
I just kind of go through and I usually
don't even read the news part or read

289
00:17:25,441 --> 00:17:29,230
the slower stuff. I make sure why, uh,

290
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:33,390
now that you're asking and that's it.
That's the entire ritual.

291
00:17:33,391 --> 00:17:35,490
I don't have the same thing for
breakfast or anything like that.

292
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:37,650
It's just that morning hit.

293
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:40,920
Do you do anything throughout
your day regularly?

294
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:43,170
Maybe it's before bed
or anything else that,

295
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,840
that most other people probably don't do?
That's a

296
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:51,360
good question. Um, no, really. Okay.

297
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:56,190
I have no special sauce,
but you're very consistent.

298
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:59,820
You don't, your days seem
to be very, very widely.

299
00:17:59,821 --> 00:18:03,060
So that in and of itself
might be something that a
lot of people don't. Okay.

300
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:06,900
Let's pick up two different,
while I'm here in this studio,

301
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:11,180
I have a lot of control over my time
and so what I do during the day is,

302
00:18:11,181 --> 00:18:12,760
is greatly varied. I'll, you know,

303
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:17,770
I'll do a lots of things for short
amounts of times and you'll go into my

304
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:19,080
workshop,
I'll read,

305
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:22,710
actually read books it down and read
bookstore in the middle of the day.

306
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,820
I'll do a hike and bring
my camera almost every day.

307
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:30,060
It may be that it's something that
most people don't do as probably,

308
00:18:30,061 --> 00:18:34,590
they probably aren't taking pictures with
a camera every day or reading books in

309
00:18:34,591 --> 00:18:37,920
the middle of the day for that man. Right,
exactly. Well, maybe that's true. I guess.

310
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,380
How do you choose your books? Ah, that's,

311
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,540
that's a paradox of choice
probably for a lot of,

312
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:45,570
for a lot of people it is just like where
do you go listen to next one? Music,

313
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:48,360
I think the music becomes free and
everybody has all the music in the world,

314
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:52,560
but deciding what you're going to listen
to becomes the thing you pay for. And I,

315
00:18:52,561 --> 00:18:52,891
and I,

316
00:18:52,891 --> 00:18:55,800
this has been my prediction about Amazon
is that we're soon going to have like

317
00:18:56,010 --> 00:19:00,450
any book you want for free, Amazon
prime, you digital version of it.

318
00:19:00,451 --> 00:19:01,830
You can have it whenever you want,

319
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:06,600
but you will pay for us for the
recommendations. Um, that's a great point.

320
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:07,530
That's a great point.

321
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:12,210
I have a network of friends and I
listened to lots of podcasts so I get them

322
00:19:12,211 --> 00:19:17,211
from all over the place and like probably
you are this point I long ago decided

323
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,920
that in terms of the
greater scheme of things,

324
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:23,670
the cost of books were really cheap
and if I wanted to book I would buy it.

325
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:29,330
And the result is I am right now speaking
in a two story high library of books

326
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:36,090
that they have and adult to the same
with digital books because I finally

327
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:38,370
figured out that, oh, you know, if
I purchase it do you could do two,

328
00:19:38,371 --> 00:19:40,680
but before I'm reading it, it's not
going anywhere. It's just sitting there.

329
00:19:40,681 --> 00:19:44,520
So I shouldn't really purchase a digital
book until like five seconds before I'm

330
00:19:44,521 --> 00:19:45,354
going to read it.

331
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:50,190
I have exactly the opposite habit
because right, because it's like,

332
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,330
well it's there.

333
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:56,250
The whole point of kindle is that you
don't have to have it until like you need

334
00:19:56,251 --> 00:19:57,750
it.
So on the digital books,

335
00:19:57,751 --> 00:20:00,810
I don't buy anything until like
I'm seconds away from reading it,

336
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,630
then I'll get it.
But the paper books,

337
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,200
I was near to the point
of actually digitizing,

338
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:11,220
getting rid of all my paper books.
I was that close about five years ago.

339
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,580
But then I had an epiphany.

340
00:20:14,581 --> 00:20:19,440
I went to a private library and I
realized that books were never as cheap as

341
00:20:19,441 --> 00:20:23,970
they are today and there never will be
as cheap and that there's some power

342
00:20:23,971 --> 00:20:27,600
about having these things in paper.
Always available,

343
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,780
no batteries, you know, never obsolete.

344
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:34,050
And that if you made a library now,

345
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,630
you would never be able to make
some of these libraries in 50 years.

346
00:20:36,631 --> 00:20:41,631
And so I decided to keep and to kind
of cultivate this paper library as a,

347
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:46,050
you know, as something that was going
to be very powerful in the future.

348
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:48,010
I like that,
or

349
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:50,810
at least I can use it as a justification
for keeping a lot of paper books around.

350
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:57,100
I get tips from books,
from podcasts, from blogs,

351
00:20:57,101 --> 00:21:01,120
from friends,
from Amazon recommendations anywhere.

352
00:21:01,121 --> 00:21:04,960
And whenever I hear someone recommended
book, I'll go and check it out.

353
00:21:04,961 --> 00:21:07,140
And then I'm fairly free in buying it.
But,

354
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:11,290
which means I read a lot
of really mediocre books.

355
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:15,940
Well that's part of my job,
right? That's cool tools.

356
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,770
The book that we were just talking about,

357
00:21:17,771 --> 00:21:22,170
which is this catalog of possibilities
that I self published that has, oh,

358
00:21:22,171 --> 00:21:23,170
I don't know, 1500, you know,

359
00:21:23,171 --> 00:21:25,180
maybe there's a couple of hundred
books that are recommended,

360
00:21:25,181 --> 00:21:30,181
but I probably read thousands
and thousands and thousands
of books in order to

361
00:21:30,611 --> 00:21:34,750
select those.
So I see part of my job reading through,

362
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:38,530
and I read a lot of how to books. Most
of the books I'm reading is nonfiction.

363
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,390
And a lot of it is even
instructional stuff on, you know,

364
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:44,680
how to build a stone wall,
how to do Origami,

365
00:21:44,681 --> 00:21:47,950
how to send a sale like micro
satellite into space. Whatever it is,

366
00:21:47,951 --> 00:21:52,210
it doesn't matter. I will look at
it and I've seen tens of thousands,

367
00:21:52,211 --> 00:21:57,130
if not 50,000, how to books over my
lifetime. I can spot a really good one,

368
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:59,590
but still I'll read through the,
um,

369
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:02,200
the other ones in order so that
someone else doesn't have to.

370
00:22:02,201 --> 00:22:06,010
And I can recommend saying this is the
best book on building a tiny house.

371
00:22:06,011 --> 00:22:07,210
If you want to build a tiny house.

372
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:10,330
Do you, when you read these
books on Origami or Stonewall,

373
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:15,170
do you follow through and attempt these
projects or are you evaluating it purely

374
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:20,530
based on your amassed
experience of reading lots of
these types of instructional

375
00:22:20,991 --> 00:22:21,824
books?

376
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:25,310
No, actually, so maybe one of the
other things that I don't do every day,

377
00:22:25,311 --> 00:22:29,570
but one of the things I do in general
that maybe everyone else is not doing is

378
00:22:29,571 --> 00:22:32,900
that I have like a thousand hobbies.
I dabble in things.

379
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:37,940
So I have built stone walls more than one.
I have done Origami,

380
00:22:37,941 --> 00:22:42,530
I have made beer, I have made wine,
I have, you know, whatever it is. I,

381
00:22:42,531 --> 00:22:46,520
I've tried to do these things in my
life and I continued to try and do them.

382
00:22:46,521 --> 00:22:51,170
I have homeschool my son, I have, and
so as much as possible, this is what my,

383
00:22:51,171 --> 00:22:52,970
you know,
I was talking before about my day.

384
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:57,620
It's irregular in a sense that
I'm here and I have things,

385
00:22:57,621 --> 00:23:00,200
but I'm doing new things and I'm
reading new things all the time.

386
00:23:00,201 --> 00:23:04,030
So I'm in my outside, um, you know,

387
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,250
make a go card or we'll,
um,

388
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:11,380
do something that they haven't done
before and that's the basis for helping

389
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:15,650
decide about these books.
I don't have to be an expert in it,

390
00:23:15,651 --> 00:23:19,190
but I can know enough to tell whether or
not the information they're telling me

391
00:23:19,191 --> 00:23:20,300
is,
is useful.

392
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:24,280
What od project over the last
year has been the most fun?

393
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:28,920
Let's start there for you. Yeah. Well,
just the last couple of months, Charlie

394
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:33,930
built myself a real workshop and wish I
could show it to you because of the cool

395
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:36,340
things that did, it was, you know,

396
00:23:36,341 --> 00:23:41,320
if you go onto like a you line or
somewhere is container businesses,

397
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,600
they have these racks of bins.

398
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:48,350
So I filled an entire wall of
hundreds and hundreds of bins,

399
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:51,770
so, so I can organize this stuff. And, uh,

400
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:54,440
I'm a big fan of Adam Savage and he has,

401
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,650
he has a principle for his
workshops called first order access,

402
00:23:57,651 --> 00:24:01,700
which basically means that you don't
want to store things behind anything.

403
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:04,900
Everything has to be at the first
level so you can look and see.

404
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,970
It has to be within reach in the
sense that you have to be able to see

405
00:24:07,971 --> 00:24:10,220
everything that you have
and it's accessible.

406
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:12,650
You don't want things hidden
behind other things. Right.

407
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:17,860
So that's part of what I was doing with
this workshop is this kind of first

408
00:24:18,351 --> 00:24:22,250
order access. And it's true, this
really powerful. I mean I just,

409
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:27,850
the few days or the weeks I've had working
in it is just transforms everything.

410
00:24:28,671 --> 00:24:31,550
It's like I had the same problem
with my books for many, many years.

411
00:24:31,551 --> 00:24:35,770
I had books like on multiple different
bookshelves in the house ahead of inboxes

412
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:35,990
ahead,

413
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:40,820
I'm this and that and moving everything
to one location until library where

414
00:24:40,821 --> 00:24:44,960
there was two stories, I could see
all my books just transform them.

415
00:24:44,961 --> 00:24:49,340
It made it really useful because I could
find them just really go and reach for

416
00:24:49,341 --> 00:24:53,150
them. And the same thing with
finding, bringing it to my tools,

417
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:57,710
which is that you want to have things
plugged in, ready to go, labeled,

418
00:24:57,711 --> 00:25:00,110
organized first order access.

419
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:04,430
And it can make simple jobs really
simple instead of like the, you know,

420
00:25:04,431 --> 00:25:05,960
the hours of looking for something,

421
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,350
right. Gathering all the
tools, all the tools.

422
00:25:08,351 --> 00:25:11,410
And also it's just like what's happening,

423
00:25:11,411 --> 00:25:13,990
like a manual random access memory.
Right.

424
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:17,770
You have your me some plots right in front
of you. You know the tools are, yeah,

425
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,520
that's very cool.
If there were one object,

426
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,590
manual project building something that
you think every human should have the

427
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:29,680
experience of doing, what would
that be? It was very easy.

428
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,390
We need to build your own house.

429
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,920
Which shelter and it's not that
hard to do. Believe me, I actually,

430
00:25:34,921 --> 00:25:38,850
I built my own house. And your house is
amazing. I know that. Not this house,

431
00:25:38,851 --> 00:25:41,400
I mean I actually built one
from cutting down the logs,

432
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:46,600
cutting down the trees in upstate New
York and doing the stone hers. And we,

433
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,680
you know, I mean unfortunately
I don't recommend this.

434
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:51,090
We made like two by fours from trees.

435
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:54,870
You don't want to do that because it's
a pain. Because you know, standard,

436
00:25:54,871 --> 00:25:57,330
standard lumber is very,
it's very good. If it was,

437
00:25:57,331 --> 00:26:00,900
things were awful little quarter of an
inch as they are with rough sawn lumber

438
00:26:00,901 --> 00:26:03,480
is just, it's a mess. But nonetheless,

439
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,540
a large portion of the people in
the world have made their own homes,

440
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:09,450
Adobe rammed, earth,
bamboo, whatever it is.

441
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:12,960
And like going back to what we
originally started off with, um,

442
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,360
even if you don't wind up living in it,

443
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:20,430
it's empowering to know
that you can do it for,

444
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,770
if you do wind up living in it.

445
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:27,830
I have a friend Lloyd Khan who built
his magnificent place in Bolinas that he

446
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:31,440
built was salvaged material from,
from scratch over the many years.

447
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,140
It gives you the power to alter its.

448
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:36,660
So I believe that that your house
should be an extension of you,

449
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:40,470
that that really is another projection.
So another way of,

450
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:44,610
and also going back to what we're talking
about and another we have to who you

451
00:26:44,611 --> 00:26:49,611
are and to discover what you're good at
and because a well designed house should

452
00:26:49,861 --> 00:26:52,620
really reflect you. And,
and what I've discovered,

453
00:26:52,621 --> 00:26:55,950
let people design houses and they have
this kind of imaginary fantasy idea about

454
00:26:55,951 --> 00:26:58,980
themselves and what they're going to
do. Well, you know, whatever it is,

455
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,470
they're going to um, have
a swimming pool, you know,

456
00:27:01,471 --> 00:27:04,500
it's like they're never going to use the
swimming pool, whatever it is. I mean,

457
00:27:04,501 --> 00:27:07,740
very few people actually have a very good
sense of who they are and what they're

458
00:27:07,741 --> 00:27:08,910
going to use something for.

459
00:27:08,911 --> 00:27:13,911
But if you really study yourself and
really are honest and designed something,

460
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:19,910
that space can help you become successful
in the sense of making it a slot for

461
00:27:19,951 --> 00:27:23,160
you, making your own
slot. And it's another,

462
00:27:23,161 --> 00:27:28,161
it's both a kind of a byproduct of who
you are and also can help you because it

463
00:27:28,891 --> 00:27:29,910
works both ways.

464
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:33,510
I like that. Right. You're
not just finding yourself,
you're creating yourself.

465
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:37,970
Exactly. And, and that, so this is
a larger philosophical question,

466
00:27:37,971 --> 00:27:41,450
but this is something I talk about a
lot in a very high dimensional space,

467
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:43,940
which means like space of
many pending possibilities.

468
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:48,200
The act of finding in the act
of creating are identical.

469
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:53,420
There's no difference between discovering
something in inventing something.

470
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:56,890
You could be, we could say
that philosophically, you know,

471
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:59,240
Benjamin Franklin invented late tricity.

472
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:03,560
We could say that Christopher
Columbus invented America.

473
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:08,590
We could say that discovery and invention
are the same so that discovering

474
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:14,600
yourself in defending yourself is
really the same things bring about that

475
00:28:14,601 --> 00:28:16,730
process.
You have to do both at once.

476
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:19,610
I really enjoy that.
Last question,

477
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,130
if you could give your,

478
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:27,380
let's say you can pick the age,
either 15 or 20 year old self,

479
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:30,440
one or a few pieces of advice,
what would they be?

480
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:35,800
You don't have to do everything yourself.
You can hire people to do stuff.

481
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,120
I wish I had known that
when I was younger.

482
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:44,650
I wish that I had when I was 20
working for whole earth catalog.

483
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:48,010
I wish I'd known that I could've
hired a programmer to do something.

484
00:28:48,011 --> 00:28:49,990
I could have hired someone.

485
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:55,440
It took me a long time to understand that
and then recently I've been really big

486
00:28:55,511 --> 00:28:58,650
on it. Hiring people
through e lance, you know,

487
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:01,240
because I came from a little bit
of kind of a duty yourself. I mean,

488
00:29:01,241 --> 00:29:04,930
I made a nature museum when
I was 12 at a chemistry lab.

489
00:29:04,931 --> 00:29:09,220
They built myself, you know, building the
stuff and I could buy in the classroom,

490
00:29:09,221 --> 00:29:13,090
but I had a whole chemistry lab,
I had nature museums,

491
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:15,480
I did all this stuff and I did it myself.
And then of course,

492
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:19,420
moving into the whole earth catalog,
which was a kind of a do yourself thing.

493
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:22,330
I really was, um, you know, I just
talked about building my own house.

494
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:27,580
Well now I will hire
professionals to work.

495
00:29:27,581 --> 00:29:32,581
And it just took me a long time to
realize that there's something about being

496
00:29:32,621 --> 00:29:37,540
able to pay a professional to do what they
do really well is not like a weakness.

497
00:29:37,541 --> 00:29:41,770
It's like it helps them. I'm
happy, they're happy, we're happy,

498
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:44,240
and I can do a lot more now.

499
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,050
There's certainly a pleasure in
doing things yourself in dabbling it.

500
00:29:47,051 --> 00:29:50,520
But there's also this other thing, which
I didn't realize, which is there's,

501
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:55,550
there's this leverage that you get by
hiring people who are really good paying

502
00:29:58,241 --> 00:29:59,140
them,
fairly,

503
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:03,340
working with them to amplify
what it is that you want to do.

504
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,170
And I wish I knew that when I was younger.

505
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:09,000
That's a fantastic answer. And
you have, if I remember correctly,

506
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:13,160
an assistant and a researcher. Is
that, is that still true? Yeah,

507
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:15,630
it's one of the same person. Oh,
they are the same. Okay. Yeah.

508
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,710
So I thought that at one point you had
believed that you needed those people to

509
00:30:19,711 --> 00:30:20,940
be two separate people.
But

510
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:25,910
here's what I was saying was that it's
very unusual to find one person who can

511
00:30:25,911 --> 00:30:26,870
do both of those tasks.

512
00:30:26,871 --> 00:30:31,460
Both of those tasks are often not
found the same person because there's,

513
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:34,760
you know, the hunting, the
researching, the kind of,

514
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:38,330
there's a hunter aspect to research.

515
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:42,680
There's often found in a certain
personality and then they're kind of the,

516
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:47,480
the Admin is more of, um, you
know, your training kind of, um,

517
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,320
making sure things,
a gardening a little bit.

518
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:56,030
And so it's often rare to
find someone who can do both,

519
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:57,290
but as possible.

520
00:30:57,450 --> 00:31:01,890
Was it luck that you happened upon this
particular individual that you work with

521
00:31:01,891 --> 00:31:04,380
now or did you have a method for?

522
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:07,230
Was there a particular
approach that the forum for it,

523
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:07,531
uh,

524
00:31:07,531 --> 00:31:12,531
found that the place where I found
over the 14 years I've had to,

525
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:17,550
the place where I found that there
were more likely than not to have a

526
00:31:17,551 --> 00:31:21,690
combination was librarians.
I love it. That's fantastic.

527
00:31:21,691 --> 00:31:26,340
So we uh, put out notices on the
librarian mailing lists and stuff.

528
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:31,660
That is fantastic. I said, last question,
this will be the last question is,

529
00:31:31,661 --> 00:31:34,750
is there any other thoughts or advice
you'd like to leave with the listeners and

530
00:31:34,751 --> 00:31:39,280
then where would you like
people to find more from you?

531
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:41,170
You're writing anywhere else?

532
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,860
I would say congratulations to the
people who are listening to the podcasts.

533
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:48,700
I think podcasts are of
this fantastic new medium.

534
00:31:48,701 --> 00:31:52,300
I'm spending a lot of time there.
I think it's just really great.

535
00:31:52,301 --> 00:31:54,220
We're in the early days
of where this would go.

536
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:59,110
I'm really impressed by the power of
this medium to teach and to inform

537
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:02,740
sometimes to entertain. Again,
I'm thankful to you, Tim,

538
00:32:02,741 --> 00:32:05,110
for having me on and having
a chance to gab here,

539
00:32:05,111 --> 00:32:08,680
but to the people who are listening, I
think keep going. Listen to more podcasts.

540
00:32:08,681 --> 00:32:13,140
Uh, tried to go wide and know 10 mentions
them here and there. Take a chance,

541
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,980
listen to some more.
So that's one thing I would say.

542
00:32:15,981 --> 00:32:18,490
And as far as finding out more about me,

543
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:23,260
I lucked out with a very easy website.
It's my initials,

544
00:32:23,261 --> 00:32:23,801
KK,

545
00:32:23,801 --> 00:32:28,801
kk.org I have very public
email for past 25 years.

546
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:33,070
You can find it very easily on my
website if you want to email directly.

547
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,440
I have not outsourced that.

548
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:41,150
Unlike other people that I know and
my writings and books and whatnot,

549
00:32:41,151 --> 00:32:42,170
or at dub dub,
dub.

550
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:47,620
Dot kk.org cool tools is a book that I
really believe that each of you out there

551
00:32:48,261 --> 00:32:53,210
should have. It's on paper. It's
sort of the best of the website.

552
00:32:53,211 --> 00:32:58,130
Cool tools,
which has been going on for 11 years now,

553
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:02,230
where we review every
day one great tool there,

554
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,650
only positive reviews.

555
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:08,000
Why waste your time on anything but the
best and tools in the broadest sense of

556
00:33:08,001 --> 00:33:10,070
the word of things that are useful,

557
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:13,950
whether it's a lance or a book on how to,
um,

558
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:18,740
do psychedelics or a book on how to build
a workshop or how to build a house or

559
00:33:18,741 --> 00:33:20,120
how to hitchhike around the world.

560
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:25,690
I and others recommend the best here with
some great context and it's printed on

561
00:33:26,331 --> 00:33:27,890
paper,
are available on Amazon.

562
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:31,490
Not so easily fan of bookstores cause
it because it's huge. I mean it's,

563
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:34,940
it's like, it's like five pounds
ways is really, really big.

564
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:38,690
And if you don't find like 500 things
in there you didn't know about that you

565
00:33:38,691 --> 00:33:41,480
wish you knew about, like last year,
I'll give you your money back. So

566
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:46,820
enjoy that. So that's that. A cool
tools or cool tools and Amazon.

567
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:50,400
Excellent. Well Kevin, this
has been a blast. It always is.

568
00:33:50,401 --> 00:33:52,560
Every time we chat I feel
like we should chat more.

569
00:33:52,561 --> 00:33:57,180
So hopefully we'll get a chance to spend
some more time together soon back in

570
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,930
nor cal or somewhere else.

571
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,660
I know Orange Shyna it's been a long time.
I could get back.

572
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:04,680
I'm ready.

573
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:08,470
I'm headed back to Japan again.
And I know that you have lots of roots in,

574
00:34:08,471 --> 00:34:09,780
in Asia, but, um,

575
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:14,620
I go there to renew my sense of the
future because they are, you know,

576
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:17,790
they're bulldozing the past as fast as
it can and we're headed racing into the

577
00:34:17,791 --> 00:34:19,010
future. And so, uh,

578
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:22,980
I want to see what Asia has in store
for us because mathematically we don't

579
00:34:22,981 --> 00:34:23,820
count anymore.

580
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:31,410
The whatever, the 3 billion Asians
and you know, 300 million Americans,

581
00:34:31,411 --> 00:34:32,120
what can you say?

582
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:35,230
Yeah, that's right. So steady up folks.

583
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:39,160
Specialization is for insects.
I think that was Heinlein.

584
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:44,110
So enjoy your time on this planet and
look broadly like, like Kevin said, Kevin,

585
00:34:44,111 --> 00:34:47,970
thank you so much. I will talk to you
soon and, uh, have a wonderful day.

586

I'll talk to you soon. Thanks for
having me too. Okay, bye. Bye.
