1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,590
Soundcheck,
uh,

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,400
could you mouth the blue ball for a
second and tell me what you had for

3
00:00:04,401 --> 00:00:08,210
breakfast today? For breakfast
I had egg whites, onions,

4
00:00:08,211 --> 00:00:09,710
chicken and one slice of Bacon.

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:14,300
How much weight have you gained in the
last 12 months? 40 pounds. Optimal.

6
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:19,880
The hands start shaking.

7
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,300
I'm a cybernetic organism
living this year.

8
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:40,660
This episode is brought
to you by 99 designs.

9
00:00:40,661 --> 00:00:43,960
Your one stop shop for all
things graphic design related.

10
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:48,970
I've used 99 designs for everything
from banner ads to book covers,

11
00:00:48,971 --> 00:00:52,690
including sketches and mock ups
that led to the four hour body,

12
00:00:52,691 --> 00:00:55,120
which later became number one
New York Times Number One,

13
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:58,660
Wall Street Journal and the brainstorming
and a lot of it took place with

14
00:00:58,661 --> 00:01:01,120
designers from around the world.
And here's how it works.

15
00:01:01,121 --> 00:01:05,020
Whether you need a t shirt,
a business card, a website,

16
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:07,600
an APP thumbnail,
whatever it might be,

17
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:11,350
you submit that project and
designers from around the world,

18
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,990
we'll send you sketches
and mock ups and designs.

19
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,680
You choose your favorite and you have an
original that you love or you get your

20
00:01:17,681 --> 00:01:19,390
money back.
It's that straightforward.

21
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:23,080
And many of you who are listening have
already used it and created some amazing

22
00:01:23,081 --> 00:01:25,480
things that I'll be sharing in the future,
but in the meantime,

23
00:01:25,481 --> 00:01:28,450
if you want to see some of my
competitions, some of the book covers,

Tim this episode is brought
to you by Athletic Greens.

28
00:01:41,441 --> 00:01:44,650
I get asked all the time, if you could
only use one supplement, what would it be?

29
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,560
And my answer is
inevitably Athletic Greens,

30
00:01:47,561 --> 00:01:50,050
it is your all in one
nutritional insurance.

31
00:01:50,051 --> 00:01:51,790
I recommended it in the four hour body,

32
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:55,810
did not get paid for that and I
travel with it to avoid getting sick.

33
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,810
I take it in the mornings to
ensure optimal performance.

34
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,310
It just covers all my basis.

35
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:04,300
If I can't get what I need through whole
food meals throughout the rest of the

36
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:09,160
day, and you can get 50 oh my
gosh, 50% off. Yes, 50% off.

37
00:02:09,161 --> 00:02:14,161

It's tasty, but more important.

39
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,230
It will help you not screw up when
you're doing your nutritional planning.

40
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:26,740
For me, it just covers the
basis, takes a load off my mind,

41
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:31,510
puts a lot in my buddy and uh, check it
out. athleticgreens.com forward slash Tim.

42
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:37,750
Hello squirrels, chipmunks and
muskrats. Why muskrats still be racist?

43
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:41,920
We welcome everybody here because this
is the Tim Ferriss show where my job is

44
00:02:41,921 --> 00:02:45,730
to attempt to deconstruct world
class performers and teachers,

45
00:02:45,731 --> 00:02:48,940
whether they are investors,
chess prodigies, actors,

46
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:52,420
musicians or entrepreneurs.
In this particular case,

47
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,640
this episode features Noah Kagan.

48
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,790
Noah Kagan is a friend of mine
I've known for many years.

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,290
He was number thirty@numberfouratmint.com
which was sold for God knows how much

50
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:06,030
money, I think a hundred plus billion
dollars and is the chief Sumo I,

51
00:03:06,031 --> 00:03:10,570
he cofounder of sumo me.com which offers
free tools to help grow web traffic

52
00:03:10,571 --> 00:03:13,360
among other things.
Also a top rated Taco connoisseur.

53
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:14,590
I'm not sure we're going to get into that,

54
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:19,060
but he has most important created for
products that have made more than seven

55
00:03:19,061 --> 00:03:23,230
figures and that is what we're going to
delve into in this particular episode.

56
00:03:23,231 --> 00:03:26,380
Lots of tactics, tools, routines,

57
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,640
and so on that Noah has used himself and
has helped other people to use and Noah

58
00:03:30,641 --> 00:03:35,641
was also my co teacher in the
Tim Ferriss experiment episode,

59
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,770
build a business where we led Cindy,

60
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:43,860
a novice entrepreneur into scaling and
launching her business in one week and

61
00:03:43,931 --> 00:03:48,070
there are a lot of the behind the scenes
goodies where if you go to itunes.com

62
00:03:48,071 --> 00:03:53,071
forward slash timferriss that is two hours

Tim Ferriss.

64
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:58,870
I think there's an hour of bonus footage
with some really nitty gritty call

65
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:02,920
script sales and marketing stuff
that I think you will enjoy.

66
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,540
But this episode by itself
Superstrong Standalone,

67
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:12,430

00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:29,380
Enjoy Noah,
my man.

73
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,730
Welcome to the show. Thank
you for having me, Tim.

74
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:36,980
I have been looking forward to this for
quite a while because every time we talk

75
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,450
and we've known each other for years,

76
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:43,160
I come away with notes upon notes of
things that I want to test or try.

77
00:04:43,161 --> 00:04:46,730
So I'm hoping and expecting sternly,
like an angry,

78
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,070
yeah, that's a lot of pressure.
This as we will have this,

79
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:55,400
but for people who don't have uh,
too much context,

80
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:59,060
you were number 30 at Facebook.
Uh, you are number four employee.

81
00:04:59,061 --> 00:05:01,940
It meant which sold to intuit for
a hundred plus million dollars.

82
00:05:01,941 --> 00:05:06,500
And you've created multiple products
now that have earned seven figures. Uh,

83
00:05:06,501 --> 00:05:09,650
what else should people know perhaps
as background or what would you like to

84
00:05:09,651 --> 00:05:14,620
tell them about as context? I thought
that was pretty good man. I was like, wow,

85
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,610
whoever that guy is, he
sounds pretty good. Hire that
man. Speech writers. I mean,

86
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:19,710
you know,
the,

87
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:20,371
the only other thing is,

88
00:05:20,371 --> 00:05:22,710
is like I came out like a lot of
people who are listening, you know,

89
00:05:22,711 --> 00:05:25,290
I came out of Berkeley or whatever
college you come out to and I worked at a

90
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:29,330
corporate job at Intel sitting in
a cubicle. Um, and then, you know,

91
00:05:29,331 --> 00:05:30,091
I didn't really use it,

92
00:05:30,091 --> 00:05:32,940
networking or any of that kind of stuff
to kind of eventually go to these kind

93
00:05:32,941 --> 00:05:36,570
of cool companies and be able to create
my own businesses that give me the

94
00:05:36,571 --> 00:05:37,920
freedom to do a lot of
things I want to do.

95
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:42,880
And you are in Austin, Texas, is that
right? Yes sir. Where did you grow up?

96
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:46,680
I grew up in bay area, about a mile
and a half from the apple headquarters.

97
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,770
So near Cupertino
somewhere. Yeah. You know,

98
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:54,960
the question of why there
has been a mass exodus,

99
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:59,600
it would seem from cities like New York
City and San Francisco to Austin is one

100
00:05:59,601 --> 00:06:03,080
I've never really heard. Uh, you
answer. So maybe I can just ask you,

101
00:06:03,081 --> 00:06:06,620
why is Austin becomes such a hotbed and
why did you choose to move to Austin?

102
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,750
Yeah, I mean, I actually interned

103
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:13,910
like in 2000, about 10 years
ago and I came out here and, uh,

104
00:06:13,911 --> 00:06:16,730
I never heard of the place. I didn't even
know. I mean, in Texas now it's, you know,

105
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:18,210
because the Internet,
people know that there's a,

106
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:21,510
there's places inside of Texas
they have like photos. Uh,

107
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,340
but I never knew what Austin was about.

108
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:27,720
And I came here and I had sex with this
person and then I got drunk and it was

109
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:28,890
like, like, what's that book,

110
00:06:28,891 --> 00:06:31,470
Lord of the flies where it's like the
young kids take over in high wind.

111
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:34,110
Yes. It's basically like
that. But we have a city.

112
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,190
So I came here and I was like, how
come no one else is here? You know,

113
00:06:41,191 --> 00:06:45,450
you're paying half as much as the bay
area for housing. We actually see grass,

114
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,260
a lot of grass around us.
Um, you got a lot of Tacos,

115
00:06:49,261 --> 00:06:52,050
which is what I'm known for and it's like
one of the capitals that Tacos in the

116
00:06:52,051 --> 00:06:54,150
nation and it's kind
of like, um, you know,

117
00:06:54,151 --> 00:06:56,460
it's like what the barrier was
probably like 10 years before now.

118
00:06:56,461 --> 00:06:59,850
It's just like you're packed and
you're paying the same prices. Uh,

119
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:02,070
and I think also fundamentally
there's a few key things for you.

120
00:07:02,071 --> 00:07:02,820
But fundamentally I just,

121
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:06,240
I didn't want to also just be around
startups talking about their funding a all

122
00:07:06,241 --> 00:07:06,960
day long.

123
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,620
And so Austin provided a lifestyle
from me where it was more affordable,

124
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:15,150
really attractive women, a
really good outside life.
Like when I leave the office,

125
00:07:15,151 --> 00:07:18,390
I have a good lifestyle. It just
really fit that fit, that balance.

126
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,201
And that's why I think it's,
you know,

127
00:07:19,201 --> 00:07:21,300
it's one of the fastest growing
cities in the nation right now.

128
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:25,670
Yeah. It's one of my favorite cities. I
almost moved there after college actually.

129
00:07:25,671 --> 00:07:27,360
It was between,
uh,

130
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,180
Austin NSF and I didn't make it to the
final round of interviews for trilogy

131
00:07:32,181 --> 00:07:35,300
software. So that made the decision
for me. So I was came very close.

132
00:07:35,301 --> 00:07:37,430
I could have forked another
way and ended up in Austin.

133
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:41,410
Did you get like flown out and like
first class in the limo experience with

134
00:07:41,411 --> 00:07:42,244
trilogy?

135
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:44,180
I don't think I made it that far.
I think,

136
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:49,390
I think they recognized a
terrible potential employee
very quickly and decided

137
00:07:49,701 --> 00:07:54,560
that, uh, I would be more trouble than I
was worth, which is probably accurate. Uh,

138
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:55,500
you know,

139
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,410
you know what's funny about that? Like
I got a job offer, well, I applied,

140
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:01,920
I've applied for Google twice and
I've been rejected twice and I'm like,

141
00:08:01,921 --> 00:08:03,930
is Google really good or am I that bad?

142
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:08,580
Or is it just like,
I meant to kind of run my own thing.

143
00:08:08,581 --> 00:08:10,380
And I remember what I did
my interview with Google,

144
00:08:10,381 --> 00:08:12,180
I couldn't remember how to do division

145
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:17,130
that makes it hard to get a job at
Google. I imagined, I was like, dude,

146
00:08:17,131 --> 00:08:21,470
I gotta use my calc. I gotta use my phone.
Do you mind? He's like, okay, it's not,

147
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,390
you're not gonna get the job done.
So like if you don't,

148
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,140
if you can't do 12 times 12 no,

149
00:08:25,141 --> 00:08:27,300
I'm sorry I have some bad news
and lets you run it. You know,

150
00:08:27,301 --> 00:08:28,610
for our cafeteria jobs.

151
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:31,710
Occasional good. It was the
division man anyways, so awesome.

152
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:33,780
I mean coming back to it,
it was just more of a,

153
00:08:33,781 --> 00:08:36,020
after being the barrier around
engineers and all that stuff. My life,

154
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:39,300
I wanted something a little
more affordable women and
outside and just kind of

155
00:08:39,301 --> 00:08:40,180
like a slower lifestyle.

156
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:42,810
I would say for younger people I would
actually recommend going to these busier

157
00:08:42,811 --> 00:08:45,000
cities. Cause you're
surrounding yourself with like

158
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:49,390
hungry, hungry people better or
what age would you say that is?

159
00:08:49,391 --> 00:08:51,630
I'm saying up until 30 I would say like

160
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:54,810
a really populated city personally. And
that's what I did because you're around,

161
00:08:54,811 --> 00:08:58,440
people are hustling and it's
really inspiring and it's
motivating and there's a

162
00:08:58,441 --> 00:09:00,810
meetup every day and we, you
know, we have that in Austin,

163
00:09:00,811 --> 00:09:03,240
but it's nowhere near the level
of the bay area or New York.

164
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,700
And so I'd say if you're going to you,

165
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,590
I would want to be around that and get
connections to that and experience that.

166
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:08,970
Cause you're, I mean,
if you look at Austin,

167
00:09:08,971 --> 00:09:11,400
like how many big companies have come
out of Austin? Tim, like name too,

168
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:17,730
Dell and blank. I'm sure there
are others. You could, okay.

169
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:21,580
So [inaudible] was actually
really good fuels. What'd she say?

170
00:09:21,581 --> 00:09:23,100
I said Willie Nelson biofuels.

171
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:26,020
The Willie Nelson Dude. I mean, I was
going to say it like a, we'd joke,

172
00:09:26,021 --> 00:09:28,300
but like name, name to that came
out of the bay area. I mean,

173
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:29,380
you could go on for days,

174
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,310
right? Yeah. So, and that's
a different special. Yeah.

175
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,140
And You have a density in SF that
you don't have an Austin, namely,

176
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,470
I guess what I mean by that is you
have the peninsula and the bay area,

177
00:09:38,471 --> 00:09:42,640
but just within San Francisco you have,
let's just call it 700,000 people,

178
00:09:42,641 --> 00:09:47,050
very densely packed in. So getting
to events, meeting New People,

179
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:48,250
uh,

180
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:53,250
bumping into the icons are billionaires
you want to meet is as easy as going to

181
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:56,680
a handful of different coffee shops.
Whereas in Austin,

182
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:58,840
in my experience having
gone to south by southwest,

183
00:09:58,841 --> 00:10:02,830
so many times it's more spread out
much like Los Angeles or those types of

184
00:10:02,831 --> 00:10:05,910
serendipitous moments are a
little harder to engineer. I mean

185
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,080
the funniest one from me,

186
00:10:07,081 --> 00:10:10,220
I was walking in San Francisco a few years
ago and I'm talking about paypal with

187
00:10:10,221 --> 00:10:13,430
my friend Boris and then I'm like,
oh my God.

188
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:16,220
Literally the Guy Walking in front of
us was Peter Teal and I was like, Peter,

189
00:10:16,221 --> 00:10:18,290
we had a question about paypal.
Could you mind if I ask you,

190
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,730
is the cofounder of paypal for people
wondering who's in the first money into

191
00:10:24,731 --> 00:10:29,260
Facebook? And another actually another
guest on the podcast as well. Uh,

192
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,630
the,

193
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,830
the place I'd like to go next and I think
maybe working backwards make sense to

194
00:10:33,831 --> 00:10:34,010
you.

195
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:39,010
I'd love to experiment
with just frontloading this
episode with a lot of tools

196
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:43,510
and tactics that people can play with, uh,
as soon as they listen to this episode.

197
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:47,080
What are some of the tools,

198
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,210
whether they're apps or otherwise,

199
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,440
that you are really into at the moment
or that you find extremely useful?

200
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:54,890
Yeah.

201
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:58,490
So I'll give you my top
things that I use in,

202
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,280
I think everyone should literally
use right now and go do these things.

203
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:04,280
Number one, and this is, it's
not even an APP or anything,

204
00:11:04,281 --> 00:11:06,170
it's speeding up your mouse pad.

205
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,580
It's the number one productivity hack
cause you're on your computer almost all

206
00:11:10,581 --> 00:11:13,910
the day. Go to your settings, speed up
your mouse, but double what you're at.

207
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:17,090
It takes a few minutes to get used to,
but you realize like holy crap,

208
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,230
everything starts at the top.
So speed up your mousepad,

209
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:23,230
everything will get faster. I really love
that one. I, because anytime I'm on a,

210
00:11:23,231 --> 00:11:25,850
someone's slower, I'm like,
wow, it's so slow. What's
wrong? Is Your computer broken?

211
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,260
So you're just going to
system preferences and then

212
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:32,510
keyboard. And then when the mouse track
pad, actually it's one of those three.

213
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,000
Yeah.
Trackpad yeah.

214
00:11:34,001 --> 00:11:37,210
You Click on track pad and then you go to
your tracking speed and move it to the,

215
00:11:37,211 --> 00:11:39,970
basically almost the fastest.
And then your keyboard is,

216
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:43,540
or the way that you get around computer
to significantly faster. Got It. Uh,

217
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,340
let me just go through a
list of things that I love.

218
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:49,180
Other things on the computer. Alfred
APP, if you're not using Alfred App,

219
00:11:49,181 --> 00:11:51,640
it's free. And basically instead
of having to even move your mouse,

220
00:11:51,641 --> 00:11:56,641
you can just hit a launch bar and then
type in whatever app you want and it'll

221
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,960
automatically loaded.
So if I wanted to open Firefox,

222
00:11:58,961 --> 00:12:03,400
I can just hit command space for our
type of hit enter and it's loaded instead

223
00:12:03,401 --> 00:12:07,840
of me having to move my mouse anywhere
on the screen. Is that uh, I've,

224
00:12:07,841 --> 00:12:12,030
I've heard of Alfred before I use,
uh, I guess it's spotlight, uh,

225
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:16,060
just built into the [inaudible] waste
lower man. It's just a lot slower.

226
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:19,030
It's way slower.
And with Alfred App you can do contacts.

227
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:22,630
I can do math with it sometimes
when I need help a lot of
the times. Okay. Got It.

228
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:25,240
When I have to do this division.
So Alfred APP is an awesome one,

229
00:12:25,241 --> 00:12:27,910
especially for getting around your Mac.
Don't know if they have a PC version yet,

230
00:12:27,911 --> 00:12:30,970
but who uses PC? Um, I don't know.

231
00:12:30,971 --> 00:12:33,370
Do you feel bad when they have like
when people are using hotmail or PC?

232
00:12:33,371 --> 00:12:37,180
I'm like Rosa everything. Okay.
Is there, okay, let me go.

233
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,160
I'm going to go more because I didn't
know what I want to give the meaty stuff

234
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,470
we um,
I use,

235
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:46,000
so let's get into apps like web and
other things for this is one is a kill or

236
00:12:46,001 --> 00:12:49,870
one, it's a chrome extension called
Facebook newsfeed eradicator. Hmm.

237
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:54,240
And this one is amazing and I used to work
at Facebook and I know all of us, you,

238
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:56,440
you have this like weird thing where
you're so used to going phase where you

239
00:12:56,441 --> 00:12:59,020
just type in Ffa and your, your
hand, you can't even control it.

240
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,270
And so we install the
Facebook newsfeed eradicator.

241
00:13:01,271 --> 00:13:04,900
You'd go to Facebook and it blocks
your news feed and then you get there.

242
00:13:04,901 --> 00:13:06,460
And I do it.
I'd probably do 10 times a day.

243
00:13:06,461 --> 00:13:09,100
I go to Facebook and I get there and
there's nothing there. And I'm like, well,

244
00:13:09,101 --> 00:13:11,200
I guess there's nothing for me
to do today. Everyone's asleep.

245
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:13,500
And I go back to my work.
Um,

246
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,090
because I think people are looking for
so many different productivity hacks.

247
00:13:16,091 --> 00:13:18,910
I just try to focus on the big ones that
are really helpful in that one is huge

248
00:13:18,911 --> 00:13:20,430
cause I go Facebook,
nothing's happening.

249
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:23,900
Go back to my day and get the
things done I want to get done. Um,

250
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,480
I use schedule once. Yeah, great program
me to love [inaudible] you use that too?

251
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,351
I do.
Yeah.

252
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:33,310
It was introduced to me by Andrew Warner
of Mixergy who's done thousands of

253
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:38,260
interviews and I as soon
as he booked me using that.

254
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:42,310
So I was the one who is speaking. You
do that. You make Tim Ferris on that.

255
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:46,380
I don't blame him though.
If you said Oh it's so nice and it's,

256
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,770
it prevents so much confusion. Do you
want to just explain how sure. So good.

257
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:55,030
The reason I like it, they have a $99 a
year plan. Make sure you find that one,

258
00:13:55,031 --> 00:13:56,140
cause they have all
these different options,

259
00:13:56,141 --> 00:13:58,570
but you can get in there and get
the $99 a year. When I believe,

260
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,300
and the nicest thing about it
is it's such an annoying thing.

261
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,100
So like if me and him wanted
to meet, I'd be like, Tim,

262
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:06,100
are you free next Tuesday at four? You
would have to come back and say, no,

263
00:14:06,101 --> 00:14:08,080
how about Wednesday? And
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

264
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,870
With schedule once it connects
automatically to your calendar,

265
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:12,760
when you send it to someone,
you could set your preferences.

266
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:16,480
So like I am very specific preferences.
Like I don't do meetings on Thursday,

267
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:20,140
I don't do meetings before 10:00 AM. Uh,
I don't do meetings during lunchtime.

268
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,670
I don't have anything after five.

269
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:25,230
And I only do meetings for
15 minutes because I really,
if it's longer than that,

270
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:27,130
like we need to figure out
why it's going so long.

271
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,230
And then basically I send
that to you and say, hey Tim,

272
00:14:29,231 --> 00:14:30,520
let's talk for that kind of period.

273
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,060
And then it makes it really easy for you
to just compare that to your scheduled,

274
00:14:33,061 --> 00:14:36,520
choose the time and it auto goes into
my calendar and we're done. Yeah. And,

275
00:14:36,521 --> 00:14:41,050
and one of the other benefits,
uh, that I noticed, number one,

276
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:45,010
the first thing someone will see when
they click the link to grab a time is

277
00:14:45,011 --> 00:14:49,300
it'll say, set your time zone
total in. That avoids all
of the confusion. Like, oh,

278
00:14:49,301 --> 00:14:52,100
sorry,
I thought it was 4:00 PM CST

279
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,930
and not PSD.
And then you have to book it again.

280
00:14:53,931 --> 00:14:57,200
It avoids all of that and it
sends reminders to people. Um,

281
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:02,120
I've been using it for instance, if
I'm doing, let's just say recording,

282
00:15:02,121 --> 00:15:03,420
and I don't typically do this,
but if I'm,

283
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:08,270
if I were recording five podcasts in a
day or I had some type of batching like

284
00:15:08,271 --> 00:15:12,950
that, I would block out an entire day
in say one hour increments or two hour

285
00:15:12,951 --> 00:15:17,840
increments and then have everybody just
pick the time that is remaining and

286
00:15:17,841 --> 00:15:21,320
available because it also happens if
you're emailing separate people competing

287
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:23,810
for a certain day,
let's just say you'll,

288
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:26,540
you'll book one person than the other
person will walk at the same time and it's

289
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:30,770
just a huge headache. So this thing
saves just dozens of hours of headache.

290
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,150
Totally, totally worth it. Um,

291
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:38,850
other ones? Yeah, no, go for
it. Uh, other ones, followup.cc.

292
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:43,620
Uh, this is my, one of my secret weapons.
Uh, I basically can never forget anything.

293
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,950
It's like I call it my Jewish mother and
my inbox because my mom never forgets

294
00:15:46,951 --> 00:15:49,460
anything. She writes everything down. Um,

295
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:52,540
and so it followups you see does is like
if I'm emailing Tim, which you know,

296
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,371
we do from time to time,

297
00:15:53,371 --> 00:15:57,300
I'll email him and in my bcc I'll put
when I want to remind, remember it.

298
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,130
So what it does is that I'll put like
oneDay@followupcc.cc and in a day it will

299
00:16:02,131 --> 00:16:03,390
email me back and say,
hey,

300
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:06,630
here's the email that you sent in the
reminder about it. So you can do this for,

301
00:16:06,631 --> 00:16:07,231
people would be like,
hey,

302
00:16:07,231 --> 00:16:09,330
I'll check in with you in two months
or I'll follow up with, you know,

303
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,300
even for things you want to do as a to
do, like, let me do this in two months.

304
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,820
So let me check this email in a week.

305
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:18,540
You can either afford it or BCC it
and it'll automatically remind you.

306
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:21,660
And I've just found that it basically
helps me never forget anything because

307
00:16:21,661 --> 00:16:22,920
sometimes you just keep it in your inbox.

308
00:16:22,921 --> 00:16:25,900
And I personally don't want anything
in my inbox if I can and the subs would

309
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:29,100
move out anything or remember anything
that I want. So I highly recommend that.

310
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,410
Yeah. Automating followups.
Super. I was just so nice. I mean,

311
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,680
and there's two email tracking
tools for open to stuff like that.

312
00:16:34,681 --> 00:16:37,230
I just wouldn't follow up. Kind of the
lightest weight, easiest for me to use.

313
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,780
Other tools that I've been using, a lot
of using perch.ceo is totally free. Uh,

314
00:16:42,781 --> 00:16:43,531
for everyone who is doing,

315
00:16:43,531 --> 00:16:45,630
I know a lot of your people are starting
either starting or running their own

316
00:16:45,631 --> 00:16:48,870
businesses. Perch provides free, um,

317
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:51,080
people to people like a Webcam.

318
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:54,000
So we have four people that work remote
and it's kind of weird cause they were

319
00:16:54,001 --> 00:16:55,470
like, what the hell are these
guys doing in the office?

320
00:16:55,471 --> 00:16:57,270
And we're wondering what
they're doing sometimes.

321
00:16:57,271 --> 00:17:00,570
And so [inaudible] gives you the chance
if you have two iPads or two phones, uh,

322
00:17:00,571 --> 00:17:03,090
to see each other.
And so it helps for communication.

323
00:17:03,091 --> 00:17:06,060
And also just like being a part of a
team versus like a random remote person.

324
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:10,620
Very cool. Yeah, I hadn't heard of
that one. I really liked that one. Um,

325
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:14,790
I like my fitness, so I'll go to a
few on the phone and web. They're,

326
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,690
they're kind of mixed. I use my fitness
pal.com almost. Well, I use it every day.

327
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:22,740
Um, and I use it because if you really
want to lose weight or gain weight,

328
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:24,300
which were, I mean, you know,
we can talk about a bit.

329
00:17:24,301 --> 00:17:28,320
I've gained 40 pounds in the past four
months and now I'm losing 40 pounds in

330
00:17:28,321 --> 00:17:30,470
the next five months or six months.
The hub,

331
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,810
just, just so people understand
what's going on here. Oh, how much,

332
00:17:33,811 --> 00:17:37,100
how much of this 40 would you
say is muscle versus fat? Well,

333
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,540
I don't know the exact, I didn't,
I probably should have been more.

334
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,640
If you had to estimate how
much of that is muscle?

335
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,550
Probably like half and half maybe.
I don't know the exact number.

336
00:17:44,551 --> 00:17:47,460
I think it's a bit more, honestly, so
just, we'll come back to this guys.

337
00:17:47,461 --> 00:17:50,070
But Noah sent me a of himself.

338
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:54,870
I hadn't seen him in about six months
and could not recognize the eye.

339
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,220
Um, now granted you're hitting a bicep
pose in the gym. No, you are. I'm kidding.

340
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,070
But it was a shot from the gym and
I was just like, what the hell?

341
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:06,990
It was a naked selfie dude. Come on
since Tuesday. Naked Selfie Tuesdays.

342
00:18:06,991 --> 00:18:09,780
That's kind of our routine.
Uh, so we'll come back to that.

343
00:18:09,781 --> 00:18:12,180
But what you can talk about, what
do you ever use? Myfitnesspal?

344
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,060
So I use my fitness pal and I track
every single thing I eat and it,

345
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:18,270
and it's not so much that I want to
be OCD and obsessive about like, Oh,

346
00:18:18,271 --> 00:18:20,850
I have to check everything and I want
to count everything. But it gives me,

347
00:18:20,851 --> 00:18:22,230
if you really want to
accomplish something,

348
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:25,650
and this is a tool that if you want
to lose five pounds, it'll say like,

349
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,110
eat this amount of calories
and this much macros,

350
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,840
and in four weeks you'll hit five
pounds. And so it's like, well,

351
00:18:30,841 --> 00:18:31,830
why wouldn't I do that?

352
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,740
And it just makes me more accountable
to help me hit the objectives of what I

353
00:18:34,741 --> 00:18:36,570
want to hit.
And so it's like,

354
00:18:36,571 --> 00:18:39,210
am I under my macros and the amounts
I wanna be hitting today or not?

355
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,700
And it just makes my life so much
simpler to be able to figure that out.

356
00:18:41,701 --> 00:18:43,920
And over time you kind of even know,
you start knowing what your,

357
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,680
you know much more about the food that
you're actually putting your mouth about.

358
00:18:46,681 --> 00:18:50,460
Like how much protein a chicken has
versus a steak versus like, um, you know,

359
00:18:50,461 --> 00:18:52,500
like a quest bar,
which is one of my favorite protein bars.

360
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,180
Doug, definitely. And uh, for those
people wondering what macros are a,

361
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:59,430
that's just referring to
the macro nutrients. So the,

362
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:03,510
the what percentage of the food you're
eating calories you're eating are coming

363
00:19:03,511 --> 00:19:05,760
from fat,
protein or carbohydrates generally.

364
00:19:05,761 --> 00:19:08,910
And then when people refer to
micronutrients, those would be,

365
00:19:08,911 --> 00:19:13,560
say the trace minerals and so on
and so forth. Vitamins. There we go.

366
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:16,740
And I'm actually experimenting with some,

367
00:19:16,741 --> 00:19:19,170
some somewhat unusual macros right now,

368
00:19:19,171 --> 00:19:21,810
which are about 80% fat calories,

369
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:26,580
15% protein and 5% or less carbohydrates,

370
00:19:26,581 --> 00:19:29,550
typically less than 30 grams a day
just to optimize for brain function as

371
00:19:29,551 --> 00:19:32,720
opposed to body function, which
is working pretty well. Uh,

372
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:36,840
what have you noticed about that?
Uh, I've noticed that when I hit,

373
00:19:36,841 --> 00:19:41,720
and I'm using a device called
the precision xtra with x
Tra for tracking ketones,

374
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:42,240
uh,

375
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,140
at at a very precise level that you would
hope since it's called the precision

376
00:19:46,141 --> 00:19:50,400
Xtra. Uh, it gives you
a readout in millimolar.

377
00:19:50,401 --> 00:19:52,320
So instead of peeing on a Keto sticks,

378
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:55,320
these things you can buy at Walgreens
or wherever to indicate if you're in

379
00:19:55,321 --> 00:19:58,140
Ketosis or not,
you can get a concentration.

380
00:19:58,141 --> 00:20:00,900
So I'll prick my finger and
check in and they'll say, oh,

381
00:20:00,901 --> 00:20:05,160
you're at 0.7 millimeters
or 1.5 millimeters and four,

382
00:20:05,161 --> 00:20:07,140
my optimal mental performance.

383
00:20:07,141 --> 00:20:12,141
I've just noticed that I perform
best at between say 1.1 and uh,

384
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:18,900
let's just call it 1.7 millimoles.
And My, my belief up to this point,

385
00:20:18,901 --> 00:20:22,270
because I hadn't had a good tool
that was a nice quest Burp, uh,

386
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:26,100
up to this point has been
the deeper the Ketosis,

387
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,650
the better my brain will perform
because the brain likes ketones.

388
00:20:28,651 --> 00:20:30,530
But for me that doesn't
appear to be the case.

389
00:20:30,531 --> 00:20:35,531
So I've been able to get super
specific and sort of use my,

390
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:39,270
the food I put in my mouth,
like a sniper shot for mental performance,

391
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:44,190
which is awesome. Um, so that's been the
primary benefit. And along with that,

392
00:20:44,191 --> 00:20:45,090
I've noticed for instance,

393
00:20:45,091 --> 00:20:48,910
all of my morning fatigue for say the
first half hour of the day is completely

394
00:20:48,911 --> 00:20:52,120
gone. I mean 100% gone. I
wake up and I'm ready to go,

395
00:20:52,121 --> 00:20:55,150
which is has never been the
case when I'm carved dependent.

396
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:57,220
So That's interesting.

397
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,680
It's funny, I was thinking,
I think a lot about, I mean,

398
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,430
I think we don't think about how much we,

399
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,880
how much sleep affects us and we all
know sleep more and it's better. Um,

400
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:09,560
I actually used to work in
bed sheets at Macy's. Um, so

401
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,260
wait,
now you worked in bed sheets,

402
00:21:11,261 --> 00:21:13,780
like you were selling bed sheets or
you'd wrap yourself up like Casper,

403
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:14,703
Casper the ghost?

404
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:19,690
No, I sold bedsheets. The old woman,
uh, on commission. How old were you?

405
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,990
How old were you when he did that? That
was in high school. All right. And uh,

406
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:27,680
so I learned a lot about like bedding
and we also worked in a towels.

407
00:21:27,681 --> 00:21:30,380
But one of the things I was gonna suggest
is like we're were talking about apps

408
00:21:30,381 --> 00:21:34,040
and tools. I think a lot people don't
think about their physical tools. So, uh,

409
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:38,650
I've tried to optimize my bed. Um, I
think I've done a pretty good job. So the,

410
00:21:38,651 --> 00:21:41,030
the company that I use
a coming on Amazon now,

411
00:21:41,031 --> 00:21:44,050
the one that I just tried actually a week
ago that I'm going to be upgraded into

412
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,020
is called Tuft and needle.

413
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:48,620
It's a lot like these kind of hipster
guys out in Arizona. Really Nice.

414
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,510
And they have like the
super comfortable mattress.

415
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:54,170
And then I found there's a guy literally
like in the Middle Midwest isn't,

416
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:57,470
he looks like your, your uncle. And
He created a thing called my pillow.

417
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:58,200
We heard of this.

418
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,570
No I haven't. I've heard of Tuft
and needle though. That one,

419
00:22:00,571 --> 00:22:02,420
that name has come up a couple
of times a month friends.

420
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:03,810
So I have to take a look at those guys.

421
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,610
Yeah,
I can put you in touch with them.

422
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:10,100
I went and slept on it and laid on it like
a few days ago. It was great. And then,

423
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:11,930
and I'm going to upgrade to that.
They have a,

424
00:22:11,931 --> 00:22:15,120
and then I use a pillow called my pillow,
which is like try phoned.

425
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,470
I don't even know what he does,

426
00:22:16,471 --> 00:22:19,590
but it's really good because what I
realized is like the more that I'm

427
00:22:19,591 --> 00:22:24,300
comfortable in bed, I just feel better.
Absolutely. And I wake up feeling pretty,

428
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:27,480
I'm good every morning and I use a
company called parachute for the bedding.

429
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:30,450
And so those are the kind
of the combination that I've
been using. And I'm like,

430
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:33,210
damn, I'm feeling really good when I wake
up in the morning from all that stuff.

431
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:36,400
And what, uh, what does the, just to,

432
00:22:36,401 --> 00:22:39,230
to come back to two
things or a few things.

433
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:43,520
The nightly rituals, what does,
what does, what does the last say,

434
00:22:43,521 --> 00:22:46,820
two hours of your days typically
look like? And when do you go to bed?

435
00:22:46,821 --> 00:22:47,900
When do you wake up,
et Cetera?

436
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,130
The, my night varies a bit more. Um,

437
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:54,910
but what I do at night is I try
to put myself to sleep by reading.

438
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:58,630
I noticed I'd try to watch shows or
anything like that and then I just get

439
00:22:58,631 --> 00:23:00,600
stimulated. So I'll go
to bed and I, you know,

440
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,050
I won't always have to
read a business book,

441
00:23:02,051 --> 00:23:03,690
which my brother had always
kind of gave me crap about.

442
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,490
Like there's other things
besides nonfiction.

443
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:07,760
And so I've been reading like
Jack reacher books. Like,

444
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:09,490
I don't know if anyone has common,
you know,

445
00:23:09,491 --> 00:23:11,050
suggestions for books that
are fiction that are good.

446
00:23:11,051 --> 00:23:12,570
Like the Martian was probably
one of the best ones.

447
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,780
Is that,
that's a graphic novels.

448
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:20,230
Uh, it's, it's movie Tom Cruise is in,
which is all surprisingly good last year.

449
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:21,520
Got It.
But I'll read,

450
00:23:21,521 --> 00:23:23,920
I'll basically just try to read and that
helps me go to sleep versus stimulating

451
00:23:23,921 --> 00:23:27,810
me. Uh, like I would watch shows like
big love, which wasn't that good. Um,

452
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,560
or now I'm watching daredevil,

453
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:32,170
but basically I realized like if I wash
this off in bed, I don't go to sleep.

454
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:35,710
So now I just do books and said, and I've
been doing that for a little while. Um,

455
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,720
so like the Martian was
an amazing fiction book.

456
00:23:37,721 --> 00:23:39,490
It's probably one of the
best in the past year or two

457
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:43,040
that the, the whole story of the
Martian, I think, what's his name?

458
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:47,630
Andrew wire or weird or something
like the whole story of how that was,

459
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:51,530
uh,
I guess self published or very,

460
00:23:51,531 --> 00:23:56,090
very small to start with and just
developed a massive cult following.

461
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:58,580
Then the audio book was a huge,

462
00:23:58,581 --> 00:24:02,840
huge blockbuster hit and it's taken off
and I think it's now being developed

463
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:06,850
into a movie or maybe the movies or
going out and I love that type of story.

464
00:24:06,851 --> 00:24:10,190
It's just like 50 shades of grey.
Everyone turned it down. Um,

465
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:14,360
and it just became a viral
sensation on its own,

466
00:24:14,361 --> 00:24:18,380
which then led to it becoming
a blockbuster, like the
book, go the fuck to sleep.

467
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:22,550
The children's book that was leaked as
a pdf among people in the publishing

468
00:24:22,551 --> 00:24:27,551
world became this huge buzz item
and then became a bestseller.

469
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:31,850
Uh, that's awesome.
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.

470
00:24:31,851 --> 00:24:36,050
What time do you typically go to bed and
when have you found you performed best

471
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,440
or how, how do you perform best in
terms of going to bed and waking up?

472
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:42,520
What are the two? One thing I do
is I don't keep a phone in my room.

473
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,630
I think that's a common thing.

474
00:24:43,631 --> 00:24:46,210
We wake up and we have a phone right in
our room and we just get all stimulated

475
00:24:46,211 --> 00:24:50,880
by that. So I keep my phone in a separate
room, hallways, um, going to see various,

476
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:51,880
I think when I'm excited,

477
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:54,550
like I remember that Guy Steve Have
Lena from like five to 10 years ago.

478
00:24:54,551 --> 00:24:55,630
We had really good content.

479
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,840
He was very like strict about wake up at
this time and don't wake up this time.

480
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:03,040
So I've changed my routines in the
past year and it's helped me where one,

481
00:25:03,041 --> 00:25:04,090
I sleep in darkness now,

482
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:08,170
so I don't sleep with natural light
and I don't really use an alarm.

483
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:10,750
And I noticed I wake up a little
later now, but when I wake up,

484
00:25:10,751 --> 00:25:13,750
I don't need coffee and
I feel more refreshed and
that's just what's worked for

485
00:25:13,751 --> 00:25:16,030
me.
So I wake,

486
00:25:16,031 --> 00:25:19,030
I think now I used to waking up at seven
30 and I'd have to go to like do my old

487
00:25:19,031 --> 00:25:21,310
man p. I don't know if you
know, do you do that at all?

488
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:24,770
Oh,
well I am a bit of a water hug,

489
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:28,640
so I usually wake up also in the middle
of the night to go to the bathroom,

490
00:25:28,641 --> 00:25:31,890
which I, yeah, I've had
my prostate checked. Um,

491
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:36,140
love the experience just getting
up. But no, I, I, you know,

492
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:38,510
I've checked out all that stuff. I
just drink too much water. So yeah,

493
00:25:38,511 --> 00:25:42,260
I get up and I do the old
man p once or twice probably.

494
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,400
Yeah.
So I just found I slept better,

495
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:47,180
so I moved my bed to
darken it and Tucker Max,

496
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:50,610
our mutual friend does that as
well. Um, and then when I wake up,

497
00:25:50,611 --> 00:25:53,880
I try not to just go get overly stimulated
with like my phone and everything

498
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:54,733
already happening.

499
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:57,870
And so my morning routine and then I
actually find that the days I'm not having

500
00:25:57,871 --> 00:25:58,681
coffee the morning I'm like,
oh,

501
00:25:58,681 --> 00:26:02,460
I slept better when I've been sitting
in darkness that's been happening. Um,

502
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,950
and then I tried to stay away from my
phone for the first hour of my morning.

503
00:26:04,951 --> 00:26:08,250
So it's from the first hour making,
ideally the same breakfast every morning.

504
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,320
And I generally will rotate
that every three months.

505
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:14,830
And so like now my breakfast is, is
one cup of egg whites, two eggs, uh,

506
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,440
with 2% cheese.

507
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:18,960
And so I'll have that in the morning
for breakfast and then I'll read for the

508
00:26:18,961 --> 00:26:19,794
next 30 minutes.

509
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:21,570
And you just scramble
all that up together?

510
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,350
Yeah, I actually did what you recommended
one of your early youtube days where

511
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,770
microwave it. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
The three minutes low carb breakfast.

512
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:32,500
Yeah it was out. I was like,
damn, you can microwave eggs now?

513
00:26:32,501 --> 00:26:36,330
Like micro everything. Um, no but
I've actually found like, you know,

514
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,650
it's relaxing and I liked that I'm
eating the same thing so I don't have to

515
00:26:38,651 --> 00:26:39,131
think about it.

516
00:26:39,131 --> 00:26:41,830
Cause sometimes actually when you
have to think about dinner or lunch or

517
00:26:41,831 --> 00:26:43,930
breakfast, it's kind of tiring. Yeah.

518
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,770
It's like I was telling me to do and you
have to process all this extra energy

519
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:47,700
that I don't really want to.

520
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:51,030
And so then I tried to create a routine
where it's like breakfast first thing

521
00:26:51,031 --> 00:26:53,880
and then it's a reading a book.
Whatever I'm interested in at that time.

522
00:26:55,790 --> 00:27:00,440
The, I'd love to dig a bit on the books
because I know you've read a lot. Uh,

523
00:27:00,441 --> 00:27:05,000
and you've mentioned books to me before,
like uh, well there, there are many,

524
00:27:05,001 --> 00:27:05,460
but uh,

525
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:08,930
I think one of them I found very helpful
and I've recommended to my startups,

526
00:27:08,931 --> 00:27:10,070
which is a who,

527
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:15,380
and maybe maybe you could explain a or
introduced that book and some of the

528
00:27:15,381 --> 00:27:18,050
others that you found
very helpful, uh, for,

529
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:22,130
for business and just for designing
your own style of business.

530
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:26,560
Sure. The one thing I wrote before, I
forget, Tim, one thing I've noticed,

531
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,330
there's two kinds.
There's many attributes,

532
00:27:28,331 --> 00:27:30,790
but I always think it's interesting
to try to understand like what are the

533
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,300
fundamentals of successful people like
you and other people that it's like, oh,

534
00:27:34,301 --> 00:27:36,310
what are they doing that
regular people aren't?

535
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,590
And the two things I've noticed is one,

536
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:41,770
I haven't really met any super
successful people that don't read.

537
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,730
I don't know if you've noticed that.
It's very, it's very unusual. Yes.

538
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,890
I've never met like, oh yeah,
I don't really read anything.

539
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:47,770
I don't really do anything.

540
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:50,320
And the second thing is this is
one that everyone can do today.

541
00:27:50,321 --> 00:27:52,680
And I do it every day. I
even do it in hotels, which,

542
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:57,260
and it's not something perverted.
Um, I know that's what you got.

543
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:01,380
It's not exclusively something for
perverted. Yeah. Let's be clear. They, uh,

544
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,610
I make my bed everyday.

545
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:04,050
I don't know if everyone else does that,

546
00:28:04,051 --> 00:28:06,420
but I've always noticed is just like a
great way to get my wind in the morning.

547
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:09,180
Um, and some other people, I think
I've mentioned that, but that's like,

548
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:10,810
I do those things like,
you know,

549
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,480
I make sure I'm reading every day
and I make sure I make my bed.

550
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,490
Those are kind of like two wins in the
morning that always, I'm like, Nah,

551
00:28:14,491 --> 00:28:16,770
it's pretty good day.
So do the book.

552
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,021
Not to interrupt,

553
00:28:18,021 --> 00:28:22,640
but I wanted to actually re enforce that
for people because I never made my bed.

554
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:26,180
And then two things happened.
Uh,

555
00:28:26,181 --> 00:28:30,370
I saw a commencement speech by a war hero,
uh,

556
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:33,230
who, you know, just a highly,

557
00:28:33,231 --> 00:28:36,500
highly decorated veteran who'd also
come back to civilian life and just done

558
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:41,030
incredibly well in the private sector.
And he said,

559
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:44,060
you can't always change everything
in the world you want to change,

560
00:28:44,061 --> 00:28:47,960
but start with making your bed in the
morning. And I was like, what? Huh?

561
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:52,580
But it stuck with me. And then I met a
monk, I think his name is Dundee punny.

562
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,720
I might be messing up the
pronunciation. In any case, he said,

563
00:28:56,750 --> 00:29:01,580
if you want to have a feeling of
sort of calm control over things,

564
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:03,500
and I'm paraphrasing here,

565
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:07,040
start with making your bed in the
morning so that when you come back to it,

566
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:11,090
it's not complete chaos and you feel like
things are in disarray. And I was like,

567
00:29:11,091 --> 00:29:13,550
wow, that sounds kind of silly, but
whatever. I'll try it for a week.

568
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:17,870
And it's been just a,
it's had a huge psychic impact.

569
00:29:17,871 --> 00:29:21,260
That's an incredible psychological Roi.
So I do that every morning as well.

570
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:22,821
Yeah,
I mean it's funny,

571
00:29:22,821 --> 00:29:25,220
I was talking with my team about similar
kind of like what are the things that

572
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:28,160
you can do today and you don't need
anybody else and you could, you know,

573
00:29:28,161 --> 00:29:32,240
make yourself feel better and get
better. I would say success. Um, and,

574
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,290
and two things that I've noticed is,
one, this is kind of a tangential,

575
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:38,030
but it's organized your dollar bills.
I don't know if you do that.

576
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:41,590
Uh, I'm not sure. You
mean like by denomination?

577
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,370
Bye. I do. By nomination,
I do it in the same order.

578
00:29:44,371 --> 00:29:45,960
So they're all front facing and my wallet.

579
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:50,700
And so I think it's a Susie Orman
things she said 10 years ago or so,

580
00:29:50,701 --> 00:29:52,830
but I've done it and I just think it's
like a respectful thing for your money

581
00:29:52,831 --> 00:29:55,470
and it kind of makes you
like, okay, money's good. Uh,

582
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,500
and the other thing is that with the bed
thing and things in my life in general,

583
00:29:58,501 --> 00:30:01,250
I don't know who told me this, but it's
hard for me to let it go, which is like,

584
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,093
just do it now.

585
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:05,460
And so if you see something that's
broken or if it's on the floor,

586
00:30:05,461 --> 00:30:08,220
if you have a dish, just like, just
get it over with. And I try to, I like,

587
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:10,290
for some reason I can't let that go.
We're not, there's things like that.

588
00:30:10,291 --> 00:30:14,030
It just helps me get that kind of
stuff done and it's relieving. Yeah.

589
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:16,800
So I do that. That's done on, do you have
mantras like that or anything? Mentally

590
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:18,780
I do. Well, I do, uh,

591
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:22,650
or reminders that are just soundbites
that I've picked up over time.

592
00:30:22,651 --> 00:30:27,651
One of them that I thought was really
profound in a lot of ways was advice I got

593
00:30:28,981 --> 00:30:32,830
from this, uh, this mother. I mean, I was,

594
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,680
I stayed with a,
a,

595
00:30:34,681 --> 00:30:39,681
an older couple and their family
in Panama at one point and the,

596
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,100
they were real power
couple, I mean the, the,

597
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:45,000
the wife had done a ton when
she was focused on career.

598
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:49,320
Husband was a huge player and had bought
and sold some of the biggest companies

599
00:30:49,321 --> 00:30:54,290
in central and South America. And
they were both really, really, uh,

600
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:57,480
content and accomplished.
And those two don't always go together.

601
00:30:57,481 --> 00:31:01,320
They're actually pretty rare.
And, uh, what she said to me was,

602
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:04,980
you should make sure you always have,
uh,

603
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:07,040
an incredible bed and,

604
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,260
and at least one incredible pair of
shoes because if you're not in one,

605
00:31:10,261 --> 00:31:15,090
you're going to be on the other. And
I was like, Huh. And so I started,

606
00:31:15,091 --> 00:31:19,170
I had always bought kind of the cheapest
shoes to get around. And I was like, Eh,

607
00:31:19,171 --> 00:31:22,290
it doesn't matter. I kind of, I
viewed my shoes like a car almost as,

608
00:31:22,291 --> 00:31:25,620
which is how I view cars. I'm like, I
don't need a Ferrari or some fancy cars.

609
00:31:25,621 --> 00:31:27,960
Just getting me from point a to point B.
Like give me the crappiest thing,

610
00:31:27,961 --> 00:31:29,700
the cheapest thing that'll,
that'll do the job.

611
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,050
And I viewed my shoes in the same way
and I didn't realize how many physical

612
00:31:34,051 --> 00:31:37,680
problems I'd created until
I actually invested in,

613
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:40,020
started investing in better shoes.
You don't need a lot. I mean,

614
00:31:40,021 --> 00:31:41,060
you've got kicked off one pair of,

615
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:45,810
it's like one pair of very good
walking shoes and, um, and you know,

616
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:49,500
I tend to prefer these days,
uh,

617
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:52,650
not necessarily the five fingers or
anything like that because I don't think

618
00:31:52,651 --> 00:31:54,510
those are great walking shoes. Uh, it,

619
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:58,970
because the human foot is not designed
to walk on concrete or asphalt. Uh,

620
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,950
but rather what you would call it,
zero drop shoes.

621
00:32:01,951 --> 00:32:03,720
So shoes that don't have an elevated heal,

622
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:07,620
but do have some protection for
the bottom of the foot. And, uh,

623
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:12,740
you can spend say 20 to 40 bucks on
a good pair of Chuck Taylor's or,

624
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:20,310
uh, vans that, and I have a
black pair of vans, for instance,

625
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,740
that can double as dress shoes.
Nobody notices.

626
00:32:22,741 --> 00:32:25,700
I had people compliment me on the shoes
when I'm at like a business dinner and

627
00:32:25,701 --> 00:32:28,140
like, oh, this a great shoes. What? I
heard that and I say vans and they just,

628
00:32:28,141 --> 00:32:31,230
they're astonished. So
that a tip, you know,

629
00:32:31,231 --> 00:32:34,350
having I high quality bed and uh,

630
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:39,210
and high quality bedding and then at
least one pair of high quality shoes is,

631
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,253
it's something that's

632
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,113
stuck with me.

633
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,860
I think that's so wanted. You
know, one thing you were saying,

634
00:32:43,861 --> 00:32:45,510
I thought it was cool.
It's like when you tell stories,

635
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:48,180
it's so much easier to remember. So
when like two weeks I'd be like, yeah,

636
00:32:48,181 --> 00:32:52,880
Tim was like in the jungle in Panama with
like some guru and they told him about

637
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:53,850
she was in a bed.

638
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:56,180
And it's so much easier for me to remember
that versus you just be like, yeah,

639
00:32:56,181 --> 00:32:57,060
I have a bed and better shoes.

640
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,890
Oh yeah, it won't, it won't
stick. Right. And the only reason,

641
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:03,790
the only reason I've remembered that is
because the context is unique. Right?

642
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,990
But what we remember, it's, it's
funny, there's this music artist,

643
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:10,780
and I'll talk about the book, who, but
this is music arctic named stitches.

644
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:13,720
I don't know if you've ever heard of him.
He's kind of like off the grid.

645
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:18,220
He's Florida based, but the guy is
insane. Like he talks about doing drugs.

646
00:33:18,221 --> 00:33:20,860
He does it, doesn't talk about
it. He does drugs on stage.

647
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,710
Like he's got stitches tattooed all over
his face. And uh, it's very extreme.

648
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:28,150
And you know, maybe it's
a fad. Maybe it's for now,

649
00:33:28,151 --> 00:33:31,540
but it makes me think about marketing
and business and being remembered.

650
00:33:31,541 --> 00:33:34,090
And you kind of made me realize like
you don't get remembered in the middle.

651
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:37,810
No, you don't. You don't get remembered
in the middle and you need to,

652
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:41,620
that's why I recommend a look.
It's not a perfect book,

653
00:33:41,621 --> 00:33:43,750
but it is a very helpful book.
At least for me,

654
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:48,040
the 22 immutable laws of marketing,
the old version, not, don't get the,

655
00:33:48,041 --> 00:33:51,770
like for Internet one,
that's like AOL era. Uh,

656
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:53,380
get the old one,

657
00:33:53,381 --> 00:33:57,970
which is like airlines and imported
beer and all of these case studies. Uh,

658
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,540
but it really points out
that if you want positioning,

659
00:34:01,541 --> 00:34:06,541
whether that's for a product for a stay
a point you're trying to persuade people

660
00:34:06,881 --> 00:34:11,820
to accept or negotiation, you have to, uh,

661
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:14,260
it's not enough just to be better.

662
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:18,130
You have to be different because no one
will have a chance to realize you're

663
00:34:18,131 --> 00:34:22,990
better if you don't have their
attention first. Uh, and uh, since it,

664
00:34:22,991 --> 00:34:27,991
just thinking if positioning in that
way is basically better as necessary but

665
00:34:29,411 --> 00:34:32,470
not sufficient I think is super critical.

666
00:34:32,890 --> 00:34:35,490
It's funny though, cause we're
were like trained as, as like a,

667
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:38,920
I think humans to follow orders and
raise her hands and stay in line.

668
00:34:38,921 --> 00:34:42,100
And I always try to encourage people
and myself included to break a rule.

669
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:45,790
And so I'm like, you're not every day,
but I'm like, okay, can I run this light?

670
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:48,340
Which not obviously I'm trying to run
lights and help people, but it's like,

671
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,440
all right,
well it says do not enter this way,

672
00:34:50,441 --> 00:34:52,660
but maybe I should just
enter it or you know,

673
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:55,390
one thing I've recommended people
is like the coffee challenge. Yeah.

674
00:34:55,391 --> 00:34:57,490
I was going to say you're
the coffee challenge

675
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:02,330
because when we, uh, when we were filming
the Tim Ferriss experiment together,

676
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:07,700
you actually forced our student to go do
this, which I thought was fantastic. Uh,

677
00:35:07,701 --> 00:35:11,170
and uh, so maybe you could explain that
to people because certainly, uh, the,

678
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:14,210
the Jason Bourne style going the
wrong way down a one way, uh,

679
00:35:14,211 --> 00:35:17,810
is probably not what I would
suggest people to do. But, uh,

680
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,570
the coffee challenge is something
I would suggest everyone do.

681
00:35:20,571 --> 00:35:21,800
So maybe you can explain that.

682
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:26,690
Yeah. Um, well, it's funny. I, so
I'll tell the story of my brother. Uh,

683
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,420
so I told my brother to do the coffee
challenge and he's like, I'm a doctor,

684
00:35:29,421 --> 00:35:32,110
I'm the man, I could do anything. And uh,

685
00:35:32,111 --> 00:35:35,240
so we went to like some random
place in Arizona where he lives.

686
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:37,980
And so the coffee challenge is you have
to go up to the counter and you order

687
00:35:37,981 --> 00:35:41,190
coffee and if you don't drink
coffee, water, tea, if you
don't drink tea or water,

688
00:35:41,191 --> 00:35:45,990
I don't care. And then you just ask
for 10% off. And everyone listening,

689
00:35:45,991 --> 00:35:48,550
I know you're listening right now. In your
ears, you're like, oh, that's stupid. No,

690
00:35:48,551 --> 00:35:51,900
it's stupid, Tim. I'm going to
pause this podcast, whatever, uh,

691
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:55,940
because it's so easy. I've been
doing sales 20 years. And uh,

692
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:58,480
I told my brother to do it and he's
like, are you kidding me? I could do it.

693
00:35:58,690 --> 00:35:59,401
I'll do it in a minute.

694
00:35:59,401 --> 00:36:03,390
So it was on his birthday last year
and he goes up to the guy and he pauses

695
00:36:03,391 --> 00:36:04,320
cause he's scared

696
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:09,860
and I filmed in the whole thing and
I was like, he's like, uh, could,

697
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:14,190
could get up to percent off. And they're
like, uh, why? He's like, because,

698
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:17,640
and they, I do believe they
ended up giving it to him.

699
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:20,890
And the coffee challenge sounds kind of
silly, but the whole point is, you know,

700
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:24,330
to of business and in life and
to even, you know, being on,

701
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,350
not necessarily the extremes,

702
00:36:25,351 --> 00:36:27,570
but you have to ask for things and
you have to put yourself out there.

703
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:30,900
And that's the hard part. And for anyone
who hasn't done the coffee challenge,

704
00:36:30,901 --> 00:36:33,090
once you go do it,
you'll learn a ton about yourself.

705
00:36:33,091 --> 00:36:35,940
Nothing that you could read in a book
or that you can even do just hearing.

706
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:38,730
So next time today you're at a place
where you're buying something Astrid,

707
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:43,550
10% off. Tell him Tim
sentia don't do that.

708
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,380
No essential, I'll take it. It's fine.

709
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,620
Tell him to come to me and see what you
learn about yourself because you realize

710
00:36:49,621 --> 00:36:52,170
it's harder than it is. But once you
get over it, and that we did this for,

711
00:36:52,171 --> 00:36:54,120
there are monthly one k
product where it's like, hey,

712
00:36:54,121 --> 00:36:57,000
go figure out that asking for money and
asking for things isn't as hard as it

713
00:36:57,001 --> 00:36:59,640
seems. And the now you can start
asking for things that you're like,

714
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:03,060
well now I want you to buy something, a
minor service or a product that you know,

715
00:37:03,061 --> 00:37:05,430
I really believe in versus just,
you know, asking for a discount,

716
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:06,540
which is more of a practice.

717
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,820
Yeah.
And I think there,

718
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:11,220
there are a couple of things that
are important to underscore there.

719
00:37:11,221 --> 00:37:16,221
The first is a lot of the limitations
we feel we have are completely self

720
00:37:18,151 --> 00:37:19,670
imposed and a,

721
00:37:19,671 --> 00:37:23,760
and if you look at say the coffee
challenge or comfort exercise,

722
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:27,390
like one from the four hour work week,
which was going into a coffee shop.

723
00:37:27,391 --> 00:37:31,080
And I would suggest probably doing these
two and two different coffee shops, uh,

724
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:35,190
just go in and lay down on the floor
for like five seconds and don't say

725
00:37:35,191 --> 00:37:39,250
anything and then just get back
up like nothing happened. And, uh,

726
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:44,040
the worst case scenario is so
trivial.

727
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:47,010
You know what I mean? It's so true.
It's just a little bit of discomfort,

728
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:52,790
but it goes to show you how many rules
we follow that may not be serving our

729
00:37:52,981 --> 00:37:54,750
best interest. Right? And, and those that,

730
00:37:54,751 --> 00:37:58,020
the coffee shop roles
are just easy to break.

731
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:02,730
So it's a safe experimental lab. But,
uh, you know, when people are like, well,

732
00:38:02,731 --> 00:38:04,020
I can do this or I can do that.

733
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:07,590
And I remember asking Matt Mullenweg
the lead developer of wordpress,

734
00:38:07,591 --> 00:38:11,540
who's now the CEO of Automattic,
which is $1 billion plus company. Uh,

735
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:14,700
I asked him a question at one point and
I was like, well, is it this or is this,

736
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,280
and his, uh, his answer was,
that's a false dichotomy.

737
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,410
Meaning you're asking
me to choose between,

738
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,640
between two things that are not mutually
exclusive or there are other options,

739
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:26,460
right? Like what is, see, what does
the c option, what does the D option?

740
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:30,840
And it's, it's a, there's an expression,

741
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:36,040
and I'm paraphrasing here to quote
actually from Thomas Edison who said, you

742
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:40,510
know, when you've examined all the
options, just remember Colin you haven't.

743
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:44,840
And it's like, Huh, interesting.
And I mean, for, for example,

744
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:47,920
with the Tim Ferriss experiment
with the TV show, uh,

745
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:50,710
when the division at Turner went out of
business and everything got shut down,

746
00:38:50,711 --> 00:38:55,510
everything got shelved. Uh,
almost everybody basically
said like, that's game over.

747
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:58,210
All right, let's all move on with our
lives. We had a good time and that's it.

748
00:38:58,211 --> 00:38:59,920
You can't get the TV show out,

749
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:01,810
you can't get the TV show
back or anything like that.

750
00:39:01,811 --> 00:39:04,660
And it took a year of looking at,
you know,

751
00:39:04,661 --> 00:39:08,830
what if I did this absurd thing,
what if I took this absurd approach?

752
00:39:08,831 --> 00:39:13,210
Like how do I craft a deal when it's,

753
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:16,240
even if I were to get the
show back for Turner, it's a,

754
00:39:16,241 --> 00:39:19,810
it's a rounding error on pocket change
for them. They're, they're just,

755
00:39:19,811 --> 00:39:21,100
there's not really incentive.

756
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:24,640
So like how do you figure out the deal
structuring and so on and eventually

757
00:39:24,641 --> 00:39:25,451
found a way to do it.

758
00:39:25,451 --> 00:39:29,390
But it took a lot of poking and prodding
and kind of rolling out hypothetical.

759
00:39:29,391 --> 00:39:31,300
It's like taking a piece of paper.
Okay.

760
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:36,100
So I'm just going to freehand write and
flow for like 10 minutes and just like,

761
00:39:36,101 --> 00:39:40,150
what are the most absurd things I could
do to possibly get these things back and

762
00:39:40,151 --> 00:39:42,820
not judge, right? You're going to
throw out really stupid things.

763
00:39:42,821 --> 00:39:45,330
Probably some illegal things,
probably some dangerous things. Uh,

764
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:47,470
probably some completely
self destructive things.

765
00:39:47,471 --> 00:39:51,190
And then you look through it and you're
like, okay, now this is interesting.

766
00:39:51,191 --> 00:39:55,570
And I heard a quote from,
or a story from a comedian,

767
00:39:55,571 --> 00:39:58,990
one standup guy and he said,
uh, how did he put it? He said,

768
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:04,870
writing well or generating good ideas
is like orchestrating a room full of

769
00:40:04,871 --> 00:40:08,830
people in a firearm. Urgency.
He's like, when if there's a fire,

770
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:12,400
you can't have everyone rush
for the exit at once. Um,

771
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:14,320
and then because they'll
get blocked in the door,

772
00:40:14,321 --> 00:40:18,370
but you have to let each one out at
a time and then you can organize it

773
00:40:18,371 --> 00:40:18,791
afterwards.

774
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:23,791
You can like group them into whatever
you stupid mediocre and good ideas after

775
00:40:24,101 --> 00:40:28,430
the fact. And so just doing that
type of freehand idea generation, um,

776
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:32,460
for solutions I find to be, to
be super helpful. But I know I'm,

777
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,390
I know we've bass around a little bit but,

778
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:37,360
but it was just talking about the whole
book. But you know what's funny to him?

779
00:40:37,361 --> 00:40:38,500
Cause like, uh, I mean obviously,

780
00:40:38,501 --> 00:40:41,110
I mean you are a little more known
on the Internet and you know,

781
00:40:41,111 --> 00:40:43,810
we've done some things that people will
be like, well, you're Tim Ferris. Right?

782
00:40:43,811 --> 00:40:46,990
And that's actually what I hear a lot.
And so it, it's like, well, you're Tim,

783
00:40:46,991 --> 00:40:51,190
so it's easier for you. And I don't,
I don't think they have, I don't know.

784
00:40:51,191 --> 00:40:53,650
I think a lot of people don't have the
realization that like everyone has an

785
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:54,484
opportunity.

786
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:57,170
Yeah, I know. It definitely,
and I had, I mean, for instance,

787
00:40:57,171 --> 00:41:01,720
I had something I was doing
online recently and, uh,

788
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:04,340
this guy responded on Twitter and
he said, well, it's easy for you.

789
00:41:04,341 --> 00:41:06,620
You're Tim Ferriss and you have a
blog with a million plus people.

790
00:41:06,621 --> 00:41:11,390
And this other guy, um, um,
well known blogger Darren,

791
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:15,680
Darren rose or remedy roused
r or w s e pro blogger,

792
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:21,170
uh, who's very, very, um, savvy
content guy with a huge audience.

793
00:41:21,171 --> 00:41:25,150
He said, we all start at the same
place, zero readers, you know,

794
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,870
and it's a psych rather than,

795
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:30,270
rather than dismissing a,

796
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:35,210
dismissing other people as achieved
things that are unattainable, recognize,

797
00:41:35,211 --> 00:41:36,000
like they,

798
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,920
they started kind of like naked and
alone in the world without any skills.

799
00:41:39,921 --> 00:41:43,710
Those are, they had to develop
that. And, uh, you know,

800
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:47,930
you and I have a lot of the same
challenges even still today, I assume.

801
00:41:47,931 --> 00:41:51,320
I know we've had some pretty
deep conversations about
challenges we've had that

802
00:41:51,321 --> 00:41:53,810
everybody else has. And it's like,
you don't get rid of those problems.

803
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:55,240
You just kind of trade up,
uh,

804
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:59,800
that's do preach. I'm like, Ooh,
this sermon was good right there.

805
00:42:00,370 --> 00:42:04,070
I'm like nodding. I'm like,
yeah, tip. I mean one thing,
you know, especially cause I,

806
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:07,420
you know, started a few
businesses and uh, what I,

807
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:11,500
what I think most people don't realize
is that every major company, Facebook,

808
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,970
Dell, Microsoft, Google,

809
00:42:12,971 --> 00:42:16,510
all of it started with like one dude
or two dudes are two women with no

810
00:42:16,511 --> 00:42:21,100
customers. Yup. They all started the
same size as everyone else. So you know,

811
00:42:21,101 --> 00:42:22,990
it start there,
get that one customer and build up.

812
00:42:22,991 --> 00:42:25,440
And that's how you get to become the
size of those companies are, you know,

813
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:28,330
have a large side or whatever it is
that each person wants to accomplish.

814
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:33,840
Yeah, absolutely. I mean,
Amazon in the early days, I
mean, their, their desks were,

815
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:39,060
I think they were just doors from cheap
wooden doors from home depot across two

816
00:42:39,061 --> 00:42:41,490
file cabinets. Like those were
their desks. You know when it was,

817
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:44,150
you know what to think about.
Tim especially like with you.

818
00:42:44,151 --> 00:42:46,120
So I met you before you're
even a first booking on.

819
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:47,870
I always think it's the funniest thing.
I email you,

820
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:50,540
I got an email intro to you and I've
got an auto responder that's like, Hey,

821
00:42:50,541 --> 00:42:53,570
I'm surfing in Costa Rica and I'm like,
who the fuck is Tim Ferris?

822
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:57,650
I know an autoresponder surfing in Costa
Rica. They will be back in two weeks.

823
00:42:57,651 --> 00:43:00,560
I'm like, all right, I don't
really want to meet this guy. Um,

824
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:04,430
but I think what separates out a lot of
the winners versus losers is that it's

825
00:43:04,431 --> 00:43:05,810
not only that you got the book out there,

826
00:43:05,811 --> 00:43:07,940
but you've been doing it
consistently for 10 years.

827
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,920
Same with Zuckerberg at Facebook
is that it's easy to be,

828
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:14,430
to get a hit for a week or a month
or two months, but do it for you.

829
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:18,170
Zach has made decisions for 10 years.
You've done your stuff for 10 years,

830
00:43:18,171 --> 00:43:19,660
like as soon what I've
been doing for five years,

831
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:21,410
like you know those things like,

832
00:43:21,411 --> 00:43:23,120
I mean you don't have soon as
now a seven figure business,

833
00:43:23,121 --> 00:43:26,870
but I mean $12,000 in myself the first
year. Yeah, right. And that it's like,

834
00:43:26,871 --> 00:43:29,870
well no, you're making good
money now. But it's like, yeah,

835
00:43:29,871 --> 00:43:34,040
it starts small and then you've got to
keep going. You've got to persist with it.

836
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:37,140
No, definitely. And you have to
choose the good teachers. And for me,

837
00:43:37,141 --> 00:43:42,060
because I was on my own so much and
probably for you books were a lot of those

838
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:42,880
teachers

839
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:46,700
for me. I love how you brought it back.
And everyone here, that right there,

840
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:50,400
that's an interviewer. All right,
so we're going to do the WHO books.

841
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:51,161
So let me just look.

842
00:43:51,161 --> 00:43:53,440
Do you mind if I just rattle them
off and then people just go by him,

843
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,880
rattle them off and then I
might ask you to dig into some.

844
00:43:56,410 --> 00:43:58,830
All right, so here are the books.
So I went through, I have a,

845
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:01,200
I can give you the list for
everyone about every book I've read.

846
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:04,050
I can't like every book
and movie I've read. Um,

847
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:06,670
and I'm just gonna give you
like the seven inch one,

848
00:44:06,671 --> 00:44:10,990
the business related and personal that I
think are just super, super helpful. Um,

849
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,880
my favorite one in the past year
has been a centralism. Yup. Um,

850
00:44:14,910 --> 00:44:17,340
and it's basically just the whole
book literally is just like say no to

851
00:44:17,341 --> 00:44:20,520
everything. That's not important.
So I learned that at Facebook.

852
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:23,460
That book was a great reminder of it.
And even like with our main product,

853
00:44:23,461 --> 00:44:27,480
tsunami.com like we have one goal,
which is to hit a certain revenue target.

854
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:30,720
And every decision we do is either
does it help towards that or not?

855
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:35,430
And we no to everything else. Um, the WHO
book that in, feel free to interrupt me.

856
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:40,500
I'm sure you will. I don't
know. Do I? We've, uh,

857
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:43,710
we've known each other long enough.
I'll, I'll jump in if need be. Perfect.

858
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:46,850
The whole book is, there's a
longer book called topgrading, uh,

859
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:50,520
which I wouldn't read because it's
like, it's sick. It's really thick.

860
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:52,110
The Hook is like a
condensed version of it.

861
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:54,840
And I learned it at meant
where the founder was using it.

862
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,620
And so who basically helps you create
a framework for thinking about who you

863
00:44:58,621 --> 00:45:01,260
want to hire, the questions you want
to ask and then how do you filter,

864
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:03,660
find them and then get down to make
sure you have the right person.

865
00:45:04,330 --> 00:45:08,460
Matt interview was great cause he makes
people audition for the jobs and I liked

866
00:45:08,461 --> 00:45:09,960
that. But I also use who, which you know,

867
00:45:09,961 --> 00:45:13,170
helps you have some really basic questions
that you could standardize so that

868
00:45:13,171 --> 00:45:14,750
you can compare people who,

869
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:20,150
who has some really solid chapters that
lay out exactly the series of questions

870
00:45:21,871 --> 00:45:25,290
that you can ask at different points
in the process. It's really solid.

871
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:28,890
What I'll do, Tim, is I'll email you after
this. I'll email you my, I'm so weird.

872
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:32,190
I write book reports on every book I read.
Awesome.

873
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:35,580
And so I'll email you the book report on
who. So for the people that, you know,

874
00:45:35,581 --> 00:45:37,840
it's funny cause I think if you read it
you'll get more out of it cause you'll,

875
00:45:37,850 --> 00:45:40,230
you have to keep reading the same message.
Most books are one page,

876
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:44,560
but you repeat it enough times, you
remember it. Um, and so yeah, I'll,

877
00:45:44,561 --> 00:45:46,820
I'll send you the book report
afterwards so that people can uh, cool.

878
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:50,070
Get the condensed version. I'll add,
I'll add all sorts of goodies in the,

879
00:45:50,071 --> 00:45:52,580
in the show notes of my two other,

880
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:55,380
my favorite sales
business book of all time,

881
00:45:55,381 --> 00:45:58,080
which is one of the underground ones.
And I think you might know Amanda Holmes,

882
00:45:58,081 --> 00:46:00,750
but it's from her father and it's
called the ultimate sales machine.

883
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,930
And this book is just like,
it's like an underground,

884
00:46:03,931 --> 00:46:06,870
I had it on my shelf for six months.
It was the one that you kind of skip over.

885
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:09,510
Like I have a books on my shelf now
and I skipped over him. I'm like that.

886
00:46:09,511 --> 00:46:10,344
I get to that one later.

887
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:14,070
And I finally got it for an airplane and
I get on the airplane and I opened the

888
00:46:14,071 --> 00:46:16,930
first page and I'm on the introduction
and I'm like, all right, rabbit ear,

889
00:46:16,931 --> 00:46:19,470
that page, next page, rabbit
here, next page, rabbit here.

890
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:23,670
Like the whole book was folded over and
I finished it on that airplane ride and

891
00:46:23,671 --> 00:46:25,620
it's one of these books that
not enough people talk about,

892
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:27,930
but everyone who reads it is always like,
oh, I'm really glad I read that one.

893
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:32,410
You must fold your pages like Origami
best you guys is because I usually hear

894
00:46:32,411 --> 00:46:35,760
dot. I usually hear dog year, but
rabbit here I kinda like, yeah,

895
00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:38,970
I've actually been trying to carry a
pen when I read certain business books

896
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:42,420
because I just find it easier to come
back to the specific sections I want to

897
00:46:42,421 --> 00:46:45,450
write in my book reports.
Um, other things,

898
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:48,090
an old school book that if you're
looking to do service type business,

899
00:46:48,091 --> 00:46:50,700
million dollar consulting is great for
how to raise your prices and how to

900
00:46:50,701 --> 00:46:53,640
actually start your own service
or consulting based business.

901
00:46:53,641 --> 00:46:57,990
I really liked that. Um, right now I'm
really thinking a lot more about sales,

902
00:46:57,991 --> 00:47:00,540
especially with Zumiez, we're
growing that product. Uh,

903
00:47:00,541 --> 00:47:03,020
so I read two books recently that
were really strong on sales ones,

904
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:07,350
the sales acceleration formula,
and that is more around SAS based selling,

905
00:47:07,351 --> 00:47:10,740
but it could still be good for, you
know, how to find the right as a surface,

906
00:47:10,741 --> 00:47:14,430
like a, the the sumo of meetings
or the dropboxes of the world. Wow.

907
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:16,930
You've lumped me with Dropbox.
Thanks Bro. No problem. Hey man,

908
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:20,730
the tsunami, the googles. Um,

909
00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:23,970
so it's basically like how to find
like filter through people on Linkedin,

910
00:47:23,971 --> 00:47:27,940
how to ask the specific texts or
how to ask for a referral. Um,

911
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:30,760
you don't ask for, you don't email
someone asking to hire them. You asked,

912
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:31,241
emailed them,

913
00:47:31,241 --> 00:47:34,030
asked to refer someone else and that's
generally a good way to get to know them

914
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:35,260
and possibly get a referral.

915
00:47:35,330 --> 00:47:38,450
Well, it's like raising money. People
say if you want, if you want money,

916
00:47:38,451 --> 00:47:41,990
ask for advice. If you want advice,
ask for money. Oh Man. Actually No.

917
00:47:41,991 --> 00:47:45,800
One thing that I think Shane, you
know Shane Snow? I do. Yeah. Oh yeah,

918
00:47:45,801 --> 00:47:47,930
he's been on your side.
If he wrote a,

919
00:47:47,931 --> 00:47:51,140
he did a bunch of experimentation with
soylent when it first came out and then

920
00:47:51,141 --> 00:47:55,100
wrote the first kind of review of
two weeks of being on it on my blog,

921
00:47:55,101 --> 00:47:59,060
which caused all sorts of viral storms.
But uh, yeah, yeah, I do know Shane.

922
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:02,040
I love Shane and everyone should check
out his book smart cuts. It's actually,

923
00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:04,530
it's a really good book too,
but that wasn't even the point.

924
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:08,940
Shane told me one of the great ways you
can get a mentor or meet anyone you want

925
00:48:08,941 --> 00:48:12,520
to meet is just interview them.
So that's something actually for me,

926
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:15,070
there's companies I really respect,
like Taco Deli, it's a look,

927
00:48:15,090 --> 00:48:19,050
it's my favorite Taco in the world. Um,
and then Austin. And so I basically,

928
00:48:19,051 --> 00:48:20,160
you know, you reach out
to people like, Hey,

929
00:48:20,161 --> 00:48:21,750
I just want to promote you to my audience.

930
00:48:21,751 --> 00:48:24,210
And even if you have a small audience
and what Tim, me and you can actually,

931
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:26,820
I think we're going to possibly later
show people how to get their own audience

932
00:48:26,850 --> 00:48:30,570
live right up in the show. Oh yeah. Well,
I don't, won't be live, it'll be recorded.

933
00:48:30,571 --> 00:48:32,490
And you can do it instantly when
you listen to it on your phone.

934
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:34,020
And so shame was basically like,
yeah,

935
00:48:34,021 --> 00:48:36,270
interview people and then there's a chance
for you to meet and connect and it's

936
00:48:36,271 --> 00:48:39,480
the best way to get ahold of someone
versus normally you ask an email and be

937
00:48:39,481 --> 00:48:43,950
like, hey, can we just hold something?
Um, a few other books that I'm really,

938
00:48:43,951 --> 00:48:47,850
I really enjoyed spin selling really
shifted my mindset about how you are going

939
00:48:47,851 --> 00:48:51,090
to be approaching customers and really
thinking about like the formula which is

940
00:48:51,091 --> 00:48:52,920
like, you know, situation, problem,

941
00:48:53,610 --> 00:48:57,060
implication and then like natural
solution or need solution.

942
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:59,550
And it basically helps you really
transition people to be like, Hey,

943
00:48:59,551 --> 00:49:01,770
what problem do you have? And think about
if you're really helping them and say,

944
00:49:01,771 --> 00:49:03,930
well, if you're going to need this help,
you should probably use our solution.

945
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:08,220
It's a great way. It's the iPhone.
So think of yourself as an advocate,

946
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:10,080
which is like, hey, you have,
what's your situation? All right,

947
00:49:10,081 --> 00:49:13,110
what problem do you have? All right,
well how would the, if we can solve it,

948
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:14,970
how would that make your life
better? Oh, well, guess what?

949
00:49:14,971 --> 00:49:17,520
We actually have that solution for that
problem that we just solved for you.

950
00:49:17,521 --> 00:49:19,440
That you sound like you was
what really important for you.

951
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:24,030
Yeah, no, absolutely. And this applies
in more places than people might realize.

952
00:49:24,031 --> 00:49:26,580
So for instance,
I had someone asked me recently,

953
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:31,620
why do you think people take
action when they read your stuff?

954
00:49:31,621 --> 00:49:34,770
Like it seems like there's a high
conversion rate compared to most books.

955
00:49:34,771 --> 00:49:36,330
Like people actually take
action. And I was like, well,

956
00:49:36,331 --> 00:49:40,050
I'm not sure if that's true, but, uh,
I hope it's true. And if it is true,

957
00:49:40,590 --> 00:49:43,290
I think it's because
in each of my chapters,

958
00:49:43,291 --> 00:49:44,850
let's just say in the four hour body,

959
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:49,740
I basically take that spin selling
approach of establishing the problem first

960
00:49:49,741 --> 00:49:54,741
and combine it with the sort of story arc
of like the writer's journey or Joseph

961
00:49:55,771 --> 00:50:00,630
Campbell's stuff and tie it
into an aerator that people
can remember. So it's, uh,

962
00:50:00,650 --> 00:50:01,081
the,

963
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:05,790
these types of mental frameworks apply
to more contexts and areas than I think

964
00:50:05,791 --> 00:50:06,690
people might realize.

965
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:08,780
I mean, it applies to everything. I mean,

966
00:50:08,781 --> 00:50:11,190
I don't think people realize that like
the two most important things I've,

967
00:50:11,310 --> 00:50:13,880
I mean I don't have to most important
to very important things or copywriting

968
00:50:13,881 --> 00:50:14,714
and selling.

969
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:17,750
And I think those are that in personal
finance or three of the probably most

970
00:50:17,751 --> 00:50:20,030
undervalued or under recognized things
that people should spend more time

971
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:20,560
learning.

972
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:23,380
What have you read that has
helped you most with copywriting?

973
00:50:24,210 --> 00:50:27,720
Number one thing. And it's completely
free as the Gary Halbert letters. Yeah.

974
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:31,370
So my good level and if you know my good
buddy, yeah, yeah, yeah, of course. Yeah.

975
00:50:31,371 --> 00:50:31,660
We can get,

976
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:34,630
I never like copywriting course and
Neville got me into him in his car.

977
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:39,020
His writing is just so fluid.
Um, and obviously it's practice,

978
00:50:39,021 --> 00:50:41,310
which I always hate because when you
hear a cliche things like they like, oh,

979
00:50:41,311 --> 00:50:46,130
I know it's practice, but I want
tips. And so the Gary Halbert letters,

980
00:50:46,131 --> 00:50:48,770
he wrote these things called the Boron
letters were to his son while he was in

981
00:50:48,771 --> 00:50:51,040
jail.
And uh,

982
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:54,380
they're just phenomenal copywriting
pieces about how to sell and how to think

983
00:50:54,381 --> 00:50:58,340
about things. And we can link to that.
Those are totally free and great. Um,

984
00:50:58,370 --> 00:51:01,070
there's the other stuff, like Ogilvy
on advertising is a really good book.

985
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:02,980
It's so, uh, it's,

986
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:06,980
it's so often recommended but
so few people actually read it.

987
00:51:06,981 --> 00:51:07,910
It's a really good book.

988
00:51:08,950 --> 00:51:09,410
You know what?

989
00:51:09,410 --> 00:51:12,740
I did it and I like literally saying this
is not a joke for you or your audience.

990
00:51:12,741 --> 00:51:16,370
Like I w I in college, I in college,
obviously that's a great sentence.

991
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:20,570
In College I was in,
I was in English as a second language.

992
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:25,310
What Dude? I'm American. I was
born in San Jose, California.

993
00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:27,770
My parents speak English,

994
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:32,090
so I'm just try to give you an idea of
how bad of a writer I was and maybe still

995
00:51:32,091 --> 00:51:34,970
am. Yeah. Are you serious? Yeah. Dude,
I was an English as a second language.

996
00:51:34,971 --> 00:51:38,710
It was me and a bunch of people who can
speak English. You took ESL courses? Yeah.

997
00:51:38,770 --> 00:51:42,380
Well I didn't want to be like crash the
course or was it, was it recommended?

998
00:51:42,381 --> 00:51:45,260
Was a requirement of cal because I wasn't,
my English was so low.

999
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:51,170
I wish it was like a joke. I'd be like,
oh, well, yeah, I can speaking. It's like,

1000
00:51:51,171 --> 00:51:52,700
dude, I, I'm from America.

1001
00:51:54,030 --> 00:51:54,690
You know,
that's,

1002
00:51:54,690 --> 00:51:57,960
it's funny you mentioned that
because I remember looking at Toefl,

1003
00:51:57,990 --> 00:52:02,990
the test of English as a foreign language
and people generally don't actually

1004
00:52:03,421 --> 00:52:05,760
understand the mechanics of
their native language very well.

1005
00:52:05,761 --> 00:52:08,190
But you forget that and you think
you're like, oh, I'm a native speaker.

1006
00:52:08,191 --> 00:52:11,010
Of course I know English. And then
you look at the test and they're like,

1007
00:52:11,011 --> 00:52:14,370
what is the difference between anything
in something? And you're like, uh,

1008
00:52:16,230 --> 00:52:20,680
I would totally fail TOEFL if I had to
take TOEFL to get into anything. Uh,

1009
00:52:20,790 --> 00:52:22,920
absolutely would probably flunk out.

1010
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:24,890
Yeah. No, so that's serious.

1011
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:27,560
So I'd take your Harvard helped and
actually no one thing that's not a book,

1012
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:31,100
but really probably changed the game for
me writing wise, besides riding a lot,

1013
00:52:31,370 --> 00:52:34,100
uh,
was getting an editor and that's it.

1014
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:36,140
Cause I would write something and
I'd be like, this sounds great.

1015
00:52:36,141 --> 00:52:36,801
I can't believe how good it.

1016
00:52:36,801 --> 00:52:40,760
And then I would show it to Neville or
Anton at the [inaudible] team and they'd

1017
00:52:40,761 --> 00:52:42,590
be like, this is garbage.
And I'm like, no, it's good.

1018
00:52:42,591 --> 00:52:46,100
And then once they would start reading
it, um, and give me the feedback,

1019
00:52:46,101 --> 00:52:48,300
it changed and I'm like,
okay, now I'm getting wide.

1020
00:52:48,350 --> 00:52:51,740
It's not as entertaining or how I can
improve things like photos and bold and

1021
00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:54,020
how it shifts around my sentence,
grammar and structure.

1022
00:52:54,350 --> 00:52:57,530
How would you suggest people
implement that for themselves?

1023
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:02,270
If they're asking someone to, to
proofread something, uh, what do you,

1024
00:53:02,271 --> 00:53:03,630
what are the instructions that you give

1025
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:07,840
on or what type of person are you
looking for? Wa working backwards.

1026
00:53:07,841 --> 00:53:11,020
I'm looking for someone who I like their
writing and also I'll tell you what I

1027
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:12,490
did last year,
which was really helpful.

1028
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:15,470
I created an inner
circle and it basically,

1029
00:53:15,471 --> 00:53:18,010
it was people that I really enjoyed
their writing and I said, hey,

1030
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:19,390
I'm going to create a
small group of people.

1031
00:53:19,391 --> 00:53:22,330
I think there was about five of us and
anytime we're putting on an article,

1032
00:53:22,570 --> 00:53:25,470
let's send it to the group and you
can leave comments in the Google doc.

1033
00:53:25,471 --> 00:53:27,780
Everyone can just leave a comment.
So it doesn't change the writing,

1034
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:31,560
but it can give you feedback about
that type of writing. And it also,

1035
00:53:31,561 --> 00:53:33,570
when you finally finished article,
those people would help promote it,

1036
00:53:33,571 --> 00:53:35,070
which is a whole nother marketing tactic.

1037
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:36,160
So do those people,

1038
00:53:36,161 --> 00:53:40,390
then you would upload a new doc to Sam
shared folder and then just invite those

1039
00:53:40,391 --> 00:53:41,920
people via email or how do you guys

1040
00:53:42,070 --> 00:53:45,100
exactly, well, so if you created a
Google doc, so I would go to Google docs,

1041
00:53:45,101 --> 00:53:47,710
create a file, just any file.
I would share it with them.

1042
00:53:47,711 --> 00:53:50,830
So I'd share it with you and then on
that file and you can have it be just

1043
00:53:50,831 --> 00:53:53,530
comment only. And so they would go
in and leave a bunch of comments.

1044
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:55,690
I would go fix it and be like, wow,
that was actually a lot better.

1045
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:58,990
And then subsequently my writing even
get stronger and I would do it for them

1046
00:53:58,991 --> 00:54:00,070
when they had their articles.

1047
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:01,830
Got It. Got It. Okay.

1048
00:54:01,910 --> 00:54:04,400
Cause like I dunno for you, like
I'm, I'm still, you know. Okay.

1049
00:54:04,401 --> 00:54:07,400
dork.com my personal blog, you
know, it's 100,000 subscribers.

1050
00:54:07,401 --> 00:54:10,400
It gets decent metric. I'm still scared
of my writing because it's just like,

1051
00:54:10,970 --> 00:54:13,730
cause you know, and that's why I like
having an editor because I'm like,

1052
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,970
there's probably tons of grammar that's
going to get ripped on and know it

1053
00:54:16,971 --> 00:54:19,460
represents me and I want to look good.
Um,

1054
00:54:19,461 --> 00:54:21,800
so having the editor and like
peers be able to edit my things,

1055
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,060
especially with like with Google docs,

1056
00:54:23,061 --> 00:54:26,270
I know a lot of people use like
Hemingway or, uh, what does it draft?

1057
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:30,900
Yeah. Draft I've used, it's
pretty sweet. Um, draft I
like, I haven't used Hemingway,

1058
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:34,170
like the name despite the guy's
a somewhat unfortunate end.

1059
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:37,560
But those are two ones for like group
editing. I mean, so for writing. Yeah.

1060
00:54:37,561 --> 00:54:38,400
Those are the stuff.

1061
00:54:38,430 --> 00:54:42,120
And then the two ones I would say
coming back to like selling stuff, um,

1062
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:45,900
spin selling. I just mentioned sales
acceleration formula we talked about.

1063
00:54:45,901 --> 00:54:49,540
And then I'd say lastly, there's a
book called small giants. Uh, okay.

1064
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:54,420
Which are all giants is a great book.
Uh, it does, I'll let you describe it.

1065
00:54:54,421 --> 00:54:58,110
It had a huge impact on me though when
I read it. What was the impact of five,

1066
00:54:58,111 --> 00:55:01,320
seven, eight years ago? Well, I in I
assume we're talking about the same book,

1067
00:55:01,321 --> 00:55:05,580
it's a bull, Berlin, Berlin
Willingham. Uh, it just,

1068
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:07,440
I think the sub,
what is the subtitle?

1069
00:55:07,450 --> 00:55:10,650
Something like companies
that choose to be the best,

1070
00:55:10,651 --> 00:55:14,180
not the biggest or something
like that, but the, uh,

1071
00:55:14,910 --> 00:55:19,910
the idea that size or growth does not
have to be the measure of success if

1072
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:27,861
you're an entrepreneur and she's a very
conceptually uncommon thing to hear.

1073
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:30,360
Uh,
and I just loved,

1074
00:55:30,361 --> 00:55:35,361
that's one of the books that kind of put
the finishing touches on convincing me

1075
00:55:35,701 --> 00:55:40,650
that, you know, selling, trying to find
price insensitive people to sell to,

1076
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:42,030
uh,

1077
00:55:42,030 --> 00:55:45,750
is just a complete game changer or making
something that is so good and so over

1078
00:55:45,751 --> 00:55:47,940
delivers it. You can charge
a premium price. Um, those,

1079
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:51,450
those are a few of the things that I
took away from that. What about you?

1080
00:55:52,330 --> 00:55:53,470
That's very long.
I mean,

1081
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:56,260
I think a few people that are listening
that are not in silicon valley,

1082
00:55:56,261 --> 00:55:59,960
I don't think they understand like how,
I don't know. I don't know exactly.

1083
00:55:59,961 --> 00:56:00,291
Not as fair,

1084
00:56:00,291 --> 00:56:03,310
but it's just like everything is about
if you're a billion dollar company and if

1085
00:56:03,311 --> 00:56:05,740
you're going viral and if you're a lot
of funding and if you're not here and

1086
00:56:05,741 --> 00:56:07,960
nobody in you're nothing
and everything is pointless.

1087
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:11,360
And it was really refreshing to hear
these, you know, pretty, you know,

1088
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:16,380
substantial companies like a Clif bar
or I think there's a beer company in San

1089
00:56:17,530 --> 00:56:19,840
Francisco, uh, that we're doing
great things in big companies,

1090
00:56:19,841 --> 00:56:23,110
but just doing it in their own way and
it's, you know, it's very empowering.

1091
00:56:23,230 --> 00:56:23,741
Realize like,
yeah,

1092
00:56:23,741 --> 00:56:26,410
you can do your own thing and it can be
big and you don't have to compromise on

1093
00:56:26,411 --> 00:56:29,380
those things. Like my favorite
Taco shop here, it's been,

1094
00:56:29,410 --> 00:56:31,840
they've been around since
1999 and they have five shops.

1095
00:56:32,470 --> 00:56:36,220
But our common notion is that
you have to go viral, not viral,

1096
00:56:36,221 --> 00:56:37,054
but you have to scale.

1097
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:41,380
So 10 shops in 20 shops and they're going
at a pace that's comfortable for them.

1098
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:43,570
They don't have to be Starbucks,
you know,

1099
00:56:43,630 --> 00:56:46,050
and they're just doing their Taco Deli
thing. And that's why I respect him and,

1100
00:56:46,051 --> 00:56:47,830
and you know, I get, I
talk about them so much.

1101
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:52,120
Yeah. Uh, it's, it's, it can
be a really profound, I think,

1102
00:56:52,121 --> 00:56:54,590
awakening for people when they start to,

1103
00:56:55,310 --> 00:56:58,470
when they sit down and
really try to assess what,

1104
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:02,810
what would add value to
their lives and more joy and

1105
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:06,110
excitement.
And that's,

1106
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:09,670
that's very rarely money for the
sake of money because the money you,

1107
00:57:09,890 --> 00:57:13,190
you exchange for an experience or,
uh,

1108
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:17,720
interacting with certain types of
people or any number of things.

1109
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:22,460
And there are other ways to get those
things besides scaling a company,

1110
00:57:22,461 --> 00:57:25,910
making a, making a bunch of money that
you can trade for those things. I mean,

1111
00:57:25,911 --> 00:57:28,760
for instance, you mentioned
the Taco shop. Uh,

1112
00:57:28,790 --> 00:57:32,960
you could look at other examples like
Jiro from Jiro dreams of Sushi and his

1113
00:57:32,961 --> 00:57:34,200
like 12 seater,

1114
00:57:34,670 --> 00:57:38,120
a three star Sushi restaurant in Tokyo.

1115
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:40,790
He has no desire to scale that.
You know what I mean? In fact,

1116
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:45,791
it's kind of antithetical to his entire
personality and a mission for sort of

1117
00:57:47,211 --> 00:57:49,240
perfecting his craft. Right. And you know,

1118
00:57:49,250 --> 00:57:51,850
one of the examples of from small giants,
uh,

1119
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:53,150
there was an Auntie to Franco example,

1120
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:58,010
but then there was another example which
I thought was so awesomely niche and so

1121
00:57:58,011 --> 00:58:00,980
just fantastic, which
was a, and I thought,

1122
00:58:00,981 --> 00:58:02,120
I'm pretty sure I'm
getting the book right.

1123
00:58:02,121 --> 00:58:06,410
It was a leather pants and a specifically
the person who made leather pants for

1124
00:58:06,411 --> 00:58:08,450
like Sheryl crow and they became a huge,

1125
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:10,450
the famous cause she
has nice legs and asked,

1126
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:13,310
but also the pants were
really cool and you know, for,

1127
00:58:13,430 --> 00:58:17,060
I think Aerosmith and so on. But it one
of these examples where they're, uh,

1128
00:58:17,210 --> 00:58:21,080
they're like this guy I
bought a hunting rifle from,

1129
00:58:21,081 --> 00:58:25,040
he makes 20 rifles a year and they're
customized. They're just incredible.

1130
00:58:25,041 --> 00:58:27,770
And he'd done me a bunch of favors
and I wanted one of his guns.

1131
00:58:27,771 --> 00:58:29,360
But it was also just to say thank you.

1132
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:34,100
And they have no desire
to scale and how that,

1133
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:39,400
how dramatically that improves their
quality of life and ability to ability to

1134
00:58:41,661 --> 00:58:46,661
optimize other facets of their life when
you remove that as the sole objective.

1135
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:48,680
Anyway, I just, uh,

1136
00:58:48,950 --> 00:58:52,220
I'm really glad you brought that book
up cause I actually have it on my

1137
00:58:52,221 --> 00:58:57,221
bookshelf literally in my living room
positioned in a way that anytime I sit

1138
00:58:57,501 --> 00:59:01,670
down on my couch I can see it face out
right next to a handful of other books

1139
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:02,990
like a Zorba,

1140
00:59:02,991 --> 00:59:06,940
the Greek and the magic of thinking
big and a few others have you to read a

1141
00:59:06,950 --> 00:59:10,890
Richard Simon's book. Oh surely. You
must be joking. Mr Feinman there.

1142
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:13,930
Have you talked about in the show?
I don't think I have, but it's,

1143
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:18,350
that is actually another one of the like
half dozen books that's up on my shelf.

1144
00:59:19,770 --> 00:59:22,340
I mean why, why don't you talk
about that book for a second?

1145
00:59:22,341 --> 00:59:23,840
Because it's one of my
favorite books of all time.

1146
00:59:24,390 --> 00:59:26,760
It's one of these books and I have it.
So if you ever meet me in person,

1147
00:59:26,761 --> 00:59:30,450
I'll give you my, I have an extra
copy cause it's just that amazing. Um,

1148
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:32,400
this is a guy who won the Nobel prize.

1149
00:59:32,401 --> 00:59:34,590
I believe he helped
create the atomic bomb.

1150
00:59:34,970 --> 00:59:36,620
Yup. Yeah. He worked at Los Alamos,

1151
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:41,270
also helped identify the o ring
that caused the challenger disaster

1152
00:59:41,930 --> 00:59:43,950
and just the amount of stuff that
he's done, you're like, okay,

1153
00:59:43,951 --> 00:59:46,800
this guy has got to be weird
and he's just so greatly weird.

1154
00:59:47,070 --> 00:59:50,310
Any talks like a human and just
like all of all these extremes.

1155
00:59:50,311 --> 00:59:52,920
I think the biggest thing that I took
away from the book is just this curiosity

1156
00:59:52,950 --> 00:59:56,340
to life and experiences where he would
just start like, oh, well, you know,

1157
00:59:56,370 --> 00:59:57,750
one day I just thought
drinking wasn't fun,

1158
00:59:57,751 --> 01:00:00,150
so I stopped drinking and he walked
out of a bar and never drink again.

1159
01:00:00,151 --> 01:00:02,190
Or do you want it to pick up?
I think was a bongo drums.

1160
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:05,890
Yeah, Bongo drums. Uh, he also
wanted to learn how to pick up linen,

1161
01:00:05,891 --> 01:00:09,070
so he would go into bars.
Uh,

1162
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:11,470
just didn't give a shit what
other people thought too,

1163
01:00:11,471 --> 01:00:16,300
which was amazingly refreshing. Uh, he
decided he wanted to learn how to, uh,

1164
01:00:16,330 --> 01:00:18,130
safe crack to open safes.

1165
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:22,630
And so he would prank people in Los
almost where they were building the atomic

1166
01:00:22,631 --> 01:00:23,650
bomb.
So he would,

1167
01:00:24,490 --> 01:00:28,030
you'd take out confidential papers and
like put them on the desk of somebody who

1168
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:32,090
wanted to freak out.
Yeah.

1169
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:33,200
So I,
the,

1170
01:00:33,201 --> 01:00:35,620
the final book and what I love most
about it just makes you curious about the

1171
01:00:35,621 --> 01:00:37,240
world.
I was mentioning briefly,

1172
01:00:37,241 --> 01:00:40,190
like my brother's kid is touching grass
for the first time and I just look at

1173
01:00:40,290 --> 01:00:41,470
grasping that grasp,
whatever.

1174
01:00:41,590 --> 01:00:44,800
And this kid is like touching grass and
feeling it and experiencing it and it

1175
01:00:44,801 --> 01:00:47,050
makes you kind of just appreciate all
the things that are going around in life,

1176
01:00:47,051 --> 01:00:49,390
in the world. I'm like, oh,
that's really great. And uh,

1177
01:00:49,410 --> 01:00:51,930
and I think that book just inspired
me with that and that's why, you know,

1178
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:52,830
highly recommended.

1179
01:00:52,830 --> 01:00:57,720
It's a, it's a must read. And also
the fact that when he was on his last,

1180
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:01,560
you know, on his last legs,
towards the end of his life,

1181
01:01:01,590 --> 01:01:05,010
he was still doing things that he,

1182
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:09,020
that challenged his belief
systems or his skill.

1183
01:01:09,170 --> 01:01:14,170
So he learned how to paint very late in
his life as a scientist who is super die

1184
01:01:14,701 --> 01:01:19,701
hard engineer who really felt
like the Romance Romanticizing of,

1185
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:24,450
uh, say people who would argue
that, you know, the scientist, uh,

1186
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:29,580
takes the magic out of something like
a flower because they deconstruct it in

1187
01:01:29,581 --> 01:01:32,460
scientific terms. And his argument
was that's entirely the opposite.

1188
01:01:32,461 --> 01:01:36,510
We can appreciate so much more
that you can't see and uh,

1189
01:01:36,810 --> 01:01:41,160
but felt compelled to sort of trade best
practices with a friend of his who is a

1190
01:01:41,161 --> 01:01:42,660
well known painter and,
uh,

1191
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:46,500
become a white belt again
and suck at painting.

1192
01:01:46,530 --> 01:01:50,720
And I don't know if this was in his book,
I think there's a, there's actually a,

1193
01:01:50,721 --> 01:01:52,890
an interview with Richard
Fineman. Uh, I'll,

1194
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:56,100
I'll link to this in the show
notes@fourhourworkweek.com
forward slash podcast.

1195
01:01:56,101 --> 01:01:56,934
But,
um,

1196
01:01:57,060 --> 01:02:00,780
there's a youtube video then I'll link
to call it the pleasure of finding things

1197
01:02:00,781 --> 01:02:04,590
out. And I think in that might
be somewhere else. They talk,

1198
01:02:05,190 --> 01:02:09,210
he would go to strip clubs
to paint as like an old dude.

1199
01:02:10,350 --> 01:02:13,590
And, uh, just really was,

1200
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:17,280
was not affected by public pressure.

1201
01:02:17,281 --> 01:02:22,281
And that's something I admire so much
as in times when I feel defensive,

1202
01:02:23,341 --> 01:02:28,080
like I have to protect something that
I've created or anything like that.

1203
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:28,760
Uh,

1204
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:33,540
the fact that he was willing to seemingly
throw it all away by doing things that

1205
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:37,050
would negatively impact his reputation
when in the end they never did.

1206
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:39,210
Nobody cared because they're too
busy thinking about themselves.

1207
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:42,780
Exactly. And to add to that team, I
think you're, you're running the money.

1208
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:45,960
One thing that I started doing as a giver,
I'm like,

1209
01:02:45,961 --> 01:02:49,050
well I know I try to notice like when
I'm feeling really good or like what

1210
01:02:49,051 --> 01:02:49,980
happened that made me feel really good.

1211
01:02:49,981 --> 01:02:52,590
And I was noticing that reading and
like studying and learning like reading

1212
01:02:52,591 --> 01:02:54,060
findings book made me feel really good.

1213
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:57,280
But I noticed as we get older you just
like you scheduled day run all the work

1214
01:02:57,281 --> 01:03:00,900
stuff you're doing.
And so on Tuesdays from 10 to 12,

1215
01:03:00,901 --> 01:03:03,030
I scheduled nothing but learning.

1216
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:06,660
So every Tuesday it's on repeat and that's
one of the main tactics I put things

1217
01:03:06,661 --> 01:03:11,200
on repeat on the calendar. So 10 to 12
every Tuesday. And my friend level, uh,

1218
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:15,000
got me into learning from youtube
videos and I'm like youtube videos.

1219
01:03:15,001 --> 01:03:18,060
And so I go on youtube videos
and I bookmark specific people.

1220
01:03:18,061 --> 01:03:21,870
So finding the videos are amazing
and an Elon Musk's videos are just as

1221
01:03:21,871 --> 01:03:23,610
phenomenal. And I was like,
wow, you can learn from youtube.

1222
01:03:23,611 --> 01:03:26,610
I never really thought of intentionally
going to find things to listen to and

1223
01:03:26,611 --> 01:03:27,444
watch.

1224
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:30,340
What, how did you choose
that time? On Tuesday?

1225
01:03:31,270 --> 01:03:35,110
Uh, Monday I do team meetings
and so I would, you know,

1226
01:03:35,111 --> 01:03:36,610
I kind of almost would be
tempted to do it all day,

1227
01:03:36,611 --> 01:03:39,730
but Monday is kind of like my
organization day. Um, I can give you,

1228
01:03:39,731 --> 01:03:41,050
if you can talk about afterwards,

1229
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:44,580
I do a specific thing that really helps
me on my Mondays. Uh, so Tuesdays,

1230
01:03:44,590 --> 01:03:47,620
like the next day that I'm available to
start thinking about things because most

1231
01:03:47,621 --> 01:03:50,050
of your good stuff doesn't
come when you're doing it
comes when you're thinking.

1232
01:03:50,710 --> 01:03:54,430
Um, and then I'm starting to incorporate
on my Thursdays trying to do like a fun

1233
01:03:54,431 --> 01:03:55,510
activity like disc golf.

1234
01:03:55,860 --> 01:03:59,110
So on Thursday afternoons and Thursday
mornings tend to 12 I'll try to go out

1235
01:03:59,111 --> 01:04:02,530
and just be like play disc golf or go
for a bike ride or something where I just

1236
01:04:02,531 --> 01:04:04,660
have time.
That's my mind is like a little more free.

1237
01:04:05,710 --> 01:04:06,543
What uh,

1238
01:04:06,670 --> 01:04:10,930
do you have your activities
clustered by day?

1239
01:04:10,931 --> 01:04:13,930
Like what do you do? For instance,
you said team meetings on Mondays.

1240
01:04:13,931 --> 01:04:18,931
Is there a certain focus on Tuesdays
aside from the studying Wednesday,

1241
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:19,840
Thursday, Friday. Like do you,

1242
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:21,730
do you break things out and
categorize them that way?

1243
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:23,490
I don't bash,

1244
01:04:23,491 --> 01:04:27,780
the way I look at my week is on
Monday mornings I basically have three

1245
01:04:27,781 --> 01:04:30,990
categories that matter to me, which
is like work, workout in personal,

1246
01:04:31,410 --> 01:04:34,310
and then I labeled three things
for each one and work out.

1247
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:37,290
I put four because I work out four days
a week. So I have three things for work,

1248
01:04:37,410 --> 01:04:39,690
for things on workout in,
three things for personal.

1249
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:43,230
And then I put those in my calendar
during the week about when I want to batch

1250
01:04:43,231 --> 01:04:46,260
those tasks. Like I want to do my work
things this time during these days.

1251
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:49,080
And then I leave the rest of the
calendar open and I think market,

1252
01:04:49,140 --> 01:04:51,540
I learned that from Mark Andreessen where
he's like certain things are gonna be

1253
01:04:51,541 --> 01:04:52,440
more important to certain days.

1254
01:04:52,441 --> 01:04:54,420
I'm not going to try to lock
it out for something else.

1255
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:56,940
And so then I just focused
on a three s a commit to

1256
01:04:56,941 --> 01:05:01,941
doing@theweekandtheneverymondayireviewmycalendarwithmyfriendadamfrommybodytutor.com

1257
01:05:03,090 --> 01:05:06,070
and so we share what we said
we're going to do [inaudible] body

1258
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:07,073
tutor.

1259
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:09,180
Yeah.
Have you heard of my body tutor.com no.

1260
01:05:09,590 --> 01:05:11,220
Dyi T. U. T. O. R.

1261
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:13,140
I mean if we can talk about,

1262
01:05:13,150 --> 01:05:16,140
I'm having to stay long and talk health
and fitness but he basically has helped

1263
01:05:16,141 --> 01:05:20,350
me get abs and now he's helping me book
up to 200 and he's helping me to get big

1264
01:05:20,380 --> 01:05:22,690
back down too bulky,
ripped,

1265
01:05:22,910 --> 01:05:27,190
bulky and ripped at like one 75 and I've
been working with him for about little

1266
01:05:27,191 --> 01:05:31,480
over four years and he's one of my best
friends. What are some of the, I'm sorry,

1267
01:05:31,481 --> 01:05:34,180
go ahead. Well I was going to say, so
that's what I, how I organize my week.

1268
01:05:34,181 --> 01:05:34,720
We're on Mondays.

1269
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:38,440
I email him a review of the previous
week using followup.cc because it reminds

1270
01:05:38,441 --> 01:05:40,870
me, and I think if you don't
review what you've done,

1271
01:05:40,930 --> 01:05:42,370
it's hard to know how you're progressing.

1272
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:44,530
And then I come into what I
want to do this upcoming week.

1273
01:05:45,470 --> 01:05:48,220
And so everyone should get
an accountability buddy. Um,

1274
01:05:48,370 --> 01:05:51,430
cause it's so Adam emails
me, I'm like, Yo, what, why
didn't you do this last week?

1275
01:05:51,431 --> 01:05:53,920
Or how come every week you're doing
the same crappy thing that's not doing

1276
01:05:53,921 --> 01:05:57,190
anything you should think differently
about it. Um, so I think for a side,

1277
01:05:57,191 --> 01:05:58,300
products are fulltime businesses.

1278
01:05:58,301 --> 01:06:00,970
I still do it with him and I've been
doing this with him for a few years now.

1279
01:06:01,530 --> 01:06:03,180
Very cool. I want to, I want to,

1280
01:06:03,470 --> 01:06:07,200
to pick a little bit at some of the tips
you have for people who might want to

1281
01:06:07,201 --> 01:06:10,530
gain muscular size. Uh, I'll,
I'll, before I get to that,

1282
01:06:10,531 --> 01:06:14,340
I want to add a few other resources.
So you mentioned my body tutor,

1283
01:06:14,341 --> 01:06:15,480
which is great.
I hadn't heard of it.

1284
01:06:15,481 --> 01:06:18,660
So that's definitely going to go
in the back of my mind on the list.

1285
01:06:18,690 --> 01:06:21,810
A couple of others that people might
like for finding accountability partners

1286
01:06:22,140 --> 01:06:26,160
would be a coach. Dot
me, coach. Dot Emmy. Uh,

1287
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:30,770
it used to be lift, uh, the Oh really?
Yeah. And I advise those guys so I've,

1288
01:06:30,810 --> 01:06:33,210
I've had fun running
experiments with them.

1289
01:06:33,510 --> 01:06:38,510
The other is there are two others actually
a stick.com as t I C K k.com where

1290
01:06:39,541 --> 01:06:43,320
you can put money on the line that
you can lose if you don't hit certain

1291
01:06:43,321 --> 01:06:46,980
milestones, which is very incentivizing
for people as a consequence.

1292
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:51,780
And then a one that is very
strictly a money related,

1293
01:06:51,781 --> 01:06:55,770
which is dietbet.com so if you
want to lose weight, uh, you can,

1294
01:06:55,771 --> 01:07:00,690
you can put together a
betting pool basically and,
uh, and, and make that work,

1295
01:07:00,830 --> 01:07:04,310
uh, for gaining muscular size.
This is, I, I as you would imagine,

1296
01:07:04,330 --> 01:07:08,550
get a lot of questions about this,
but what were the biggest, uh,

1297
01:07:08,580 --> 01:07:10,950
if you had to give someone advice,
say guy,

1298
01:07:11,010 --> 01:07:16,010
who is your size before
you started bulking up for
gaining 40 pounds in 40 funds

1299
01:07:17,780 --> 01:07:21,900
in six to 12 months. And let's just say
most of that should be muscle. What,

1300
01:07:21,901 --> 01:07:23,880
what would be the advice if they're like,

1301
01:07:23,881 --> 01:07:25,380
I have never been able to gain weight men,

1302
01:07:25,381 --> 01:07:29,610
I think I'm doing everything that I could
possibly do. What, what are your tips?

1303
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:34,440
Well I would start with the foundation
so I wouldn't actually even recommend

1304
01:07:34,441 --> 01:07:36,440
this to most people because it is

1305
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:39,370
how'd you go once you hit that goal to
come back down cause you get comfortable

1306
01:07:39,371 --> 01:07:42,100
eating like Nachos and you
get comfortable with eating,

1307
01:07:42,101 --> 01:07:45,460
like drinking beer and you know,
obviously some people do clean books,

1308
01:07:45,461 --> 01:07:46,330
but I did a mix of it.

1309
01:07:46,750 --> 01:07:49,240
So what I would actually recommend is
get a foundation of being able to eat

1310
01:07:49,241 --> 01:07:52,000
healthy consistently and
maintaining or losing your weight.

1311
01:07:52,001 --> 01:07:54,610
Probably maintaining for at least,
I would say six months to a year.

1312
01:07:54,611 --> 01:07:58,760
I've been doing a consistent diet for two
years before I even tried to book. Hmm.

1313
01:07:58,990 --> 01:08:00,970
So I don't think if you,
unless you're ready to be able,

1314
01:08:01,060 --> 01:08:03,220
unless you have the mental
capacity to be able to control it,

1315
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:07,150
I wouldn't recommend it because it's very
easy to let kind of get lost with it.

1316
01:08:07,610 --> 01:08:07,930
Uh,

1317
01:08:07,930 --> 01:08:11,440
and that's why my fitness pal and Adam
were so helpful because for two years I

1318
01:08:11,441 --> 01:08:14,170
was eating very consistently and losing
weight and getting the body I wanted.

1319
01:08:14,470 --> 01:08:17,480
The one thing, it was fascinating, Tim,
was until I started doing my fitness pal.

1320
01:08:17,820 --> 01:08:20,930
Um, I was going to the gym
like three or four days a week,

1321
01:08:21,230 --> 01:08:24,820
but I was thinking tiny and I'm like,
what's The f what the F is going on? Uh,

1322
01:08:24,870 --> 01:08:28,920
and it's because I wasn't eating
enough protein and say, fuck frick.

1323
01:08:30,470 --> 01:08:33,320
I don't know. Like I was on Pat Flynn's
podcast and he's just like, he's like,

1324
01:08:33,350 --> 01:08:36,890
I had to edit half of your
interview. And so, you know, the,

1325
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:39,050
and I've been watching big
love the Mormon TV show.

1326
01:08:39,051 --> 01:08:41,990
So I'm just like all about it anyways.

1327
01:08:42,230 --> 01:08:46,970
So basically for a long time I wasn't
eating enough protein and that's why I

1328
01:08:46,971 --> 01:08:50,000
wasn't getting bigger. And so that's what
made me a little more curious about it.

1329
01:08:50,001 --> 01:08:52,280
So number one,
I would say try doing,

1330
01:08:52,281 --> 01:08:55,160
just maintaining or losing for a year
so that you're comfortable with it.

1331
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:57,230
The big things with gaining weight.

1332
01:08:57,231 --> 01:09:01,520
So I went from one 60 to 200 and
a few months. Uh, so number one,

1333
01:09:01,580 --> 01:09:03,350
I would say plan your calorie intake,

1334
01:09:03,351 --> 01:09:06,320
how much you actually need to be
having each day. Because otherwise,

1335
01:09:06,530 --> 01:09:08,030
besides that you're blind.
You're just like, well,

1336
01:09:08,031 --> 01:09:10,220
I should have this many
and you really don't know.

1337
01:09:10,221 --> 01:09:11,120
So if you want to hit a certain way,

1338
01:09:11,121 --> 01:09:14,150
just work backwards from how many calories
you need to be eating every day to

1339
01:09:14,151 --> 01:09:18,800
get that amount. Um, I'd say
the big things for me were one,

1340
01:09:18,801 --> 01:09:21,710
I had a buddy who was doing it at the
same time and that was a game changer

1341
01:09:21,770 --> 01:09:24,350
because he's doing it and he's gaining
weight and I'm like, well fuck,

1342
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:25,340
I have to do it too.

1343
01:09:25,730 --> 01:09:28,190
And it was just much more helpful to
have someone supporting me and my,

1344
01:09:28,250 --> 01:09:31,640
one of my best friends, John
Ross was locally and we're
both gaining. Uh, secondly,

1345
01:09:31,670 --> 01:09:34,490
I did use weight gainer,
which I don't know if there's debate,

1346
01:09:34,491 --> 01:09:35,780
I haven't looked at the tons of science,

1347
01:09:35,781 --> 01:09:38,030
but it does help you gain weight
and get the mass that you want.

1348
01:09:38,060 --> 01:09:40,250
It does go away a little bit
cause of creatine involve law,

1349
01:09:40,251 --> 01:09:42,870
which I'm not going to get into
because I don't know it super well. Uh,

1350
01:09:43,370 --> 01:09:45,320
but that really significantly
help me anyway. And,

1351
01:09:45,350 --> 01:09:47,720
and ultimately you kind of have
to look at like, all right,

1352
01:09:47,721 --> 01:09:50,660
you get tired of eating, you get it to
a point of like, I am sick of eating,

1353
01:09:50,661 --> 01:09:54,320
so what is the cheapest way to get as
many calories and as much protein in my

1354
01:09:54,321 --> 01:09:57,920
body to help you gain this weight?
Uh, so in the morning it was like,

1355
01:09:57,950 --> 01:10:02,480
how can I do protein shakes, a
quest, bar, egg, wall heights,

1356
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:03,170
eggs,

1357
01:10:03,170 --> 01:10:06,140
whatever I could take and
basically doubling everything
I was already currently

1358
01:10:06,141 --> 01:10:09,320
doing. So whatever you think
you're eating, eat double.

1359
01:10:09,321 --> 01:10:11,360
But basically it at some point
where you have to figure out,

1360
01:10:11,570 --> 01:10:12,530
and what I started doing,
it was like,

1361
01:10:12,531 --> 01:10:15,680
what is the protein ratio is a food
and just eating the highest protein to

1362
01:10:15,681 --> 01:10:20,030
highest like calorie food, uh, to really
put on as much weight as possible. Yeah,

1363
01:10:20,090 --> 01:10:23,990
it's the, the working out isn't the
hard part. It's the eating by far.

1364
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:28,520
And you plot and you plateau, man. I hit
like one 70, plateaued, won 80 plateaued,

1365
01:10:28,521 --> 01:10:31,730
one 90 plateaued. And you
know, it's funny as a,

1366
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:35,510
the last night I wanted to hit it by
March 1st to 200 pounds. And this is,

1367
01:10:35,540 --> 01:10:40,130
you know, I hit, why was that like
one 97 and a and my girlfriend,

1368
01:10:40,670 --> 01:10:44,270
I was like, and I was, it was like 12.
It was not tall. It was like 10 30.

1369
01:10:44,271 --> 01:10:45,890
And I'm like, Oh, I'm not going
to hit it. And she's like,

1370
01:10:45,891 --> 01:10:49,010
you need to stop being a bitch and
start putting some food in your mouth.

1371
01:10:51,980 --> 01:10:55,780
And, uh, you know, and I've ate and
drank and ate and then at, you know,

1372
01:10:55,790 --> 01:10:58,730
before midnight I was uh, you know,
like Cinderella, I hit my 200.

1373
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:02,390
There's one other thing that was really
helpful to him that aisle and I think,

1374
01:11:02,630 --> 01:11:04,970
I don't know what tool you use.
I use we things scale.

1375
01:11:05,340 --> 01:11:08,490
Yeah. With things. Yeah,
the automatic um, sort of a,

1376
01:11:08,491 --> 01:11:12,690
I guess it's Wifi or Bluetooth enabled
scale that automatically creates graphs

1377
01:11:12,691 --> 01:11:13,980
for you.
So I

1378
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:17,520
use what I do is I have a wee
thing scale and I take my,

1379
01:11:17,521 --> 01:11:20,340
and you can embed your
weight chart online.

1380
01:11:20,670 --> 01:11:25,140
So I embedded it online and I shared it
with Adam and he would check in with me

1381
01:11:25,141 --> 01:11:27,960
every day to be like, you're skinny,
you're fat, you're fat, you're doing well,

1382
01:11:27,961 --> 01:11:30,700
why aren't you getting more
weight and so forth. Um,

1383
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:33,930
and it's very counter cause
most people want to lose weight.

1384
01:11:34,230 --> 01:11:36,000
And so when you're trying to gain weight,
and especially me,

1385
01:11:36,001 --> 01:11:39,330
I'm like the guy you never want to before
I would say I'm the guy you never want

1386
01:11:39,331 --> 01:11:41,190
to eat with because
I'd be like egg whites.

1387
01:11:41,191 --> 01:11:45,900
Can you separate the cheese particles? Uh,
can you put no, but it's like, I'm like,

1388
01:11:45,901 --> 01:11:48,150
God, do you want any of the
food that they're serving you?

1389
01:11:50,220 --> 01:11:53,460
And so it was a shift in me but having
Adam and then I have a Facebook like

1390
01:11:53,461 --> 01:11:56,020
workout group where I was
posting my weight and you know,

1391
01:11:56,070 --> 01:11:59,010
I think the more people that you have to
care about you and that are checking in

1392
01:11:59,011 --> 01:12:00,720
on you, uh, on a regular basis,

1393
01:12:00,721 --> 01:12:03,330
the more it was easier for me
to help accomplish that. Yeah.

1394
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:06,690
The more you get people invested in your
progress and that could be a Facebook

1395
01:12:06,691 --> 01:12:10,980
group that you create or just promising
to put Facebook status updates,

1396
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:13,110
uh,
once a week for instance.

1397
01:12:13,111 --> 01:12:15,420
And making that commitment
publicly is extremely helpful.

1398
01:12:15,421 --> 01:12:18,720
A couple of points I'd like to underscore.

1399
01:12:18,721 --> 01:12:23,721
The first is the fact that leaning
out first we'll help you bulk faster.

1400
01:12:24,790 --> 01:12:29,220
There are a bunch of biochemical
reasons for this and um, and,

1401
01:12:29,310 --> 01:12:34,310
and sort of a biochemical but also a
neuroscience related reasons just in terms

1402
01:12:34,681 --> 01:12:37,530
of regulation of Leptin and Ghrelin,

1403
01:12:37,710 --> 01:12:41,100
Ghrelin and all of these
things where if you lean out,

1404
01:12:41,130 --> 01:12:45,060
even for two to four weeks,
doesn't have to be that long.

1405
01:12:45,330 --> 01:12:47,880
But certainly getting to the point
where let's just say hypothetically,

1406
01:12:47,881 --> 01:12:50,520
you choose the slow carb diet from,
for our body.

1407
01:12:50,730 --> 01:12:54,630
You're already at say 14% body fat.

1408
01:12:54,990 --> 01:12:59,990
You drop two to 4% in
a four to eight weeks,

1409
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:05,960
then you will have developed a
probably a very good degree of insulin

1410
01:13:06,811 --> 01:13:10,500
sensitivity.
And insulin is an anabolic hormone.

1411
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:14,580
That's why bodybuilders
sometimes inject insulin, uh,

1412
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:15,940
competitive bodybuilders,

1413
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:17,910
which I would never recommend
because you can kill yourself.

1414
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:22,320
What does that do for them?
It allows them to store more calories,

1415
01:13:22,321 --> 01:13:25,710
ingested in muscle
tissue, uh, and elsewhere.

1416
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:30,180
But it's a very, very, very
dangerous thing to do. Uh,

1417
01:13:30,210 --> 01:13:33,990
and, uh, you, you can mimic
that a little bit with say,

1418
01:13:33,991 --> 01:13:38,991
low doses of Alpha lipoic acid and there
are other things that act as insulinoma

1419
01:13:39,301 --> 01:13:42,960
medics as they would call them. Um,
but if you lean out, like if I really,

1420
01:13:42,961 --> 01:13:45,810
really want to get big for whatever
reason I haven't done in the ages because

1421
01:13:45,811 --> 01:13:47,640
it's just such a slog.
I mean,

1422
01:13:47,641 --> 01:13:50,820
you feel like a Kobe beef cow
just being fattened for slaughter.

1423
01:13:50,821 --> 01:13:55,740
I mean it's really, it's so,
it's still laborious. Oh my God.

1424
01:13:56,120 --> 01:13:58,680
Like I didn't want to eat. You can
get to it. Like at first you're like,

1425
01:13:58,710 --> 01:14:00,480
at first it's hard to do. You're
like, oh, I shouldn't have,

1426
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:03,090
I shouldn't have egg yolk. Even, I
know fat is good and all that stuff.

1427
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:05,910
But then you have egg yolks and then
it's like six egg yolks and then you're

1428
01:14:05,911 --> 01:14:08,280
like, fuck eggs. Yeah, well exactly.

1429
01:14:08,281 --> 01:14:13,060
But you do have your kind of supersize me
moment where you're like, amazing. Yeah,

1430
01:14:13,061 --> 01:14:16,150
baby. And then a week later you're
just like, can I stop? Please?

1431
01:14:16,151 --> 01:14:20,530
I want to tap out please.
I'm on the eating on the training.

1432
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:21,833
Um,

1433
01:14:22,090 --> 01:14:25,900
I'd be curious to what your
biggest mistakes were that
you'd been making from a

1434
01:14:25,901 --> 01:14:26,800
training perspective.

1435
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:30,450
Totally. I mean, the number one
thing, the number, number one,

1436
01:14:30,451 --> 01:14:33,090
number one thing was I wasn't
eating enough in the beginning.

1437
01:14:33,690 --> 01:14:37,740
So even like last year when I wanted to
start getting like bigger muscles, uh,

1438
01:14:37,741 --> 01:14:39,990
I just was eating so little
food. I'm like, well,

1439
01:14:39,991 --> 01:14:43,410
I'm supposed to eat live like egg
whites and these things and you know,

1440
01:14:43,411 --> 01:14:44,760
and I don't like don't try to get bigger.
You should,

1441
01:14:44,761 --> 01:14:46,650
you need to eat more food
and you stop being a bitch.

1442
01:14:48,630 --> 01:14:52,020
And so I started eating the egg yolks
and Tucker Max always giving me shit for

1443
01:14:52,021 --> 01:14:53,520
it too. It's like, dude, you
got to stop being a bitch.

1444
01:14:53,521 --> 01:14:55,900
And I guess that's maybe a common theme.
Uh,

1445
01:14:55,950 --> 01:14:58,920
and so you do that and you realize
like bigger dogs need more food.

1446
01:14:58,921 --> 01:15:02,040
So if you want to be bigger,
you need to put more in. Yeah.

1447
01:15:03,330 --> 01:15:06,870
So that was number one. And then I started
just doing heavier sets and less reps.

1448
01:15:06,940 --> 01:15:10,480
What would a, so what were you
doing and what did you change it to?

1449
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:13,600
So I,
there's actually a few different programs.

1450
01:15:13,601 --> 01:15:17,500
There's a guy named the online coach
and he does a thing called the shoal

1451
01:15:17,501 --> 01:15:20,410
program.
It's like something hypertrophy.

1452
01:15:20,590 --> 01:15:23,740
I don't know what he stole
like s c h o l l s H, u l

1453
01:15:24,210 --> 01:15:28,340
as he has a program that
I was following and I can,

1454
01:15:28,341 --> 01:15:29,860
I can send that to you afterwards.

1455
01:15:29,861 --> 01:15:33,670
So I followed his program and a lot of
what his arguments like super heavier

1456
01:15:33,671 --> 01:15:36,760
weights, five sets and then I
would focus on core movements.

1457
01:15:36,761 --> 01:15:39,850
So I break my thing out into four days
a week. And so the biggest mistake,

1458
01:15:39,851 --> 01:15:40,930
cause I was doing super heavy,

1459
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:46,060
super high reps with a lighter weights
for a long time and now I just wanted to

1460
01:15:46,061 --> 01:15:48,370
get bigger and bulkier. And it's funny
cause when you saw me you're like,

1461
01:15:48,371 --> 01:15:50,460
Holy Shit, you're huge. And it's like one,

1462
01:15:50,461 --> 01:15:54,700
I ate a ton more and I and I monitored it
and then I lifted a ton of heavier, uh,

1463
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:55,870
versus the lighter weights,

1464
01:15:55,871 --> 01:15:58,030
which in my opinion just kind of
give me more of the definition.

1465
01:15:58,430 --> 01:16:02,510
Yeah. Or just make you more injury prone
depending on how you do it. Certainly.

1466
01:16:02,511 --> 01:16:06,800
I mean there are a lot of folks who
do sort of high rep high velocity,

1467
01:16:06,801 --> 01:16:10,220
which is just asking for
all sorts of issues. Um,

1468
01:16:10,310 --> 01:16:14,810
and now is the the shool program,
the online fitness coach,

1469
01:16:14,811 --> 01:16:19,811
was it a sort of five sets of five reps
type of situation with exactly what

1470
01:16:20,031 --> 01:16:22,100
limits. Okay. So it's very
similar. Then there's a,

1471
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:24,740
there's a book that's become
very popular among engineers,

1472
01:16:24,741 --> 01:16:29,741
oddly enough in silicon valley called
starting strength by Mark Rippetoe.

1473
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:31,430
Rippetoe knows his stuff. He's, he's,

1474
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:36,440
he has some very pragmatic approaches to
this stuff and he actually has a second

1475
01:16:36,441 --> 01:16:41,170
book and probably more but one that
I have really enjoyed, which is,

1476
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:44,660
is a lot denser and probably
not the right one to read first,

1477
01:16:44,661 --> 01:16:47,900
but called a pragmatic
programming I think it is.

1478
01:16:47,900 --> 01:16:52,900
And it's all about lots of medium term
and long term planning of training and

1479
01:16:52,941 --> 01:16:55,170
how to cycle it and so on.
But I think that's biting off more.

1480
01:16:55,171 --> 01:16:57,410
Which one should we start with a starting
strength? Starting strength. Yeah.

1481
01:16:57,450 --> 01:17:01,220
Starting starting strength
or for for simplicity sake.

1482
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:06,080
I think a lot of the protocols
that Pavel Tsatsouline,

1483
01:17:06,081 --> 01:17:07,700
some people say his name Todd Celine,

1484
01:17:07,701 --> 01:17:11,570
but it's possible who really popularized
kettle bells in the United States.

1485
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:15,620
Some of his programs are just amazing.
So there's, there's one called, uh,

1486
01:17:16,010 --> 01:17:20,870
if you search easy strength and
Pablos fame, a lot will pop up.

1487
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:23,760
A very simple, and, um, my,

1488
01:17:23,950 --> 01:17:27,530
my podcast interview with him went really
deep into a bunch of his approaches

1489
01:17:27,531 --> 01:17:31,390
for strength and endurance and flexibility
with Pablo knows his stuff. Um,

1490
01:17:31,430 --> 01:17:34,850
also a great example of making,

1491
01:17:35,450 --> 01:17:40,450
finding the minimum effective dose that
produces the largest disproportionate

1492
01:17:41,570 --> 01:17:45,770
output or outcome. Uh, yeah, five
sets of five is hard to go wrong with.

1493
01:17:46,590 --> 01:17:47,810
Yeah. I mean, two of the
things that, you know,

1494
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:50,130
the two of the things I would say would
really help me during that whole process,

1495
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:53,580
especially for anyone trying to be in
fitness. Um, if you know, it's one,

1496
01:17:53,581 --> 01:17:55,470
as much as we want, like
less input, more output,

1497
01:17:55,471 --> 01:17:58,230
which I think you've done very
well because you figure out like,

1498
01:17:58,710 --> 01:18:01,680
how do I get maximum thing for, for
less. Part of it is consistency,

1499
01:18:01,681 --> 01:18:04,170
which I'm not gonna spend a ton of
timeline cause you don't, you have to go.

1500
01:18:04,770 --> 01:18:07,080
That's the point. Like in my calendar,
if you looked at my calendar today, Tim,

1501
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:10,350
Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday,
there's gym in there automatically.

1502
01:18:10,351 --> 01:18:11,370
I don't even get to choose.

1503
01:18:11,371 --> 01:18:14,490
It's just there at a certain
time and I do it every week. Um,

1504
01:18:14,491 --> 01:18:16,440
so consistency has been big.
And then secondly,

1505
01:18:16,620 --> 01:18:18,960
this is kind of more of a hack
one that it's not really a hack,

1506
01:18:18,961 --> 01:18:20,940
which is something that
really motivates me. Uh,

1507
01:18:20,941 --> 01:18:23,580
I follow fitness people
on Instagram. Uh, yeah,

1508
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:26,100
a lot of people use Instagram for all
their friends that they, you know,

1509
01:18:26,101 --> 01:18:29,570
post stupid photos. And I don't really
follow any friends. Uh, all I follow,

1510
01:18:29,670 --> 01:18:32,340
I follow his wrappers and fitness people.

1511
01:18:33,270 --> 01:18:36,150
What is your Instagram?
Uh, Noah Kagan. Got It.

1512
01:18:36,690 --> 01:18:40,020
But I follow like this online coach Guy,
he posts great workout videos.

1513
01:18:40,470 --> 01:18:42,390
They post things like there's,
um,

1514
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:45,240
I'll pull up some different people that
I recommend, but now he has this great.

1515
01:18:45,630 --> 01:18:46,463
Um,

1516
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:50,820
and what's awesome about it is that they
just post all the different workouts,

1517
01:18:50,821 --> 01:18:52,200
what they eat,
motivation.

1518
01:18:52,201 --> 01:18:54,780
And so during the day when I'm on the
toilet or I'm kind of feeling lazy,

1519
01:18:54,781 --> 01:18:56,700
I go on my Instagram and I see
that their bodies are ripped.

1520
01:18:56,830 --> 01:18:57,970
And what was your recommendation?

1521
01:18:57,971 --> 01:19:00,540
We're going to come back to looking at
ripped bodies while sitting on the toilet.

1522
01:19:02,470 --> 01:19:05,070
Well the two things I was going to
recommend is number one, if you're in,

1523
01:19:05,090 --> 01:19:06,880
it's dropping out and I'm not
sure it's going to on today,

1524
01:19:06,881 --> 01:19:10,650
but I basically went and upgraded
our routers like an asis rt,

1525
01:19:10,810 --> 01:19:12,250
eight six dine net Dasher,

1526
01:19:12,251 --> 01:19:16,060
but basically like focus on the things
that are the highest levels of the funnel.

1527
01:19:16,090 --> 01:19:18,490
And I noticed my router is the first
thing that my internet comes in that

1528
01:19:18,491 --> 01:19:20,950
affects all of my work.
And so we went in and I don't know,

1529
01:19:20,970 --> 01:19:22,930
this is like a 200 $300 router.

1530
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:25,090
So if you're at home and you're
working on your internet matters,

1531
01:19:25,091 --> 01:19:27,640
like go in and invest in that because
that's at the top of the funnel and

1532
01:19:27,641 --> 01:19:29,980
optimize the things where you get
the biggest results downwards.

1533
01:19:30,210 --> 01:19:33,200
Definitely. So you said two things, what
would, what's the other one? I don't know.

1534
01:19:33,210 --> 01:19:38,190
The router, the router and then
Instagram. We'll, we'll, let's,

1535
01:19:38,191 --> 01:19:42,810
let's come back to Instagram. So
looking at rip people, uh, I wanted to,

1536
01:19:43,420 --> 01:19:46,320
uh, have, I thought I was
maybe a Weirdo on my own, but,

1537
01:19:46,321 --> 01:19:48,120
so I actually do the exact same thing.

1538
01:19:48,240 --> 01:19:53,240
I'm trying to get better at gymnastics
and more bodyweight calisthenic type

1539
01:19:53,551 --> 01:19:55,650
movements. Ooh. So all,

1540
01:19:55,651 --> 01:19:59,140
almost all of people I follow
on Instagram and I'm just Tim.

1541
01:19:59,250 --> 01:20:02,430
Tim Ferriss with two r's and
two s's on Instagram are, uh,

1542
01:20:02,450 --> 01:20:06,840
like gymnastic bodies or
maybe gymnastics bodies, uh,

1543
01:20:07,350 --> 01:20:08,220
is incredible.

1544
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:12,210
There are a couple of very impressive
par core athletes and acrobats,

1545
01:20:12,211 --> 01:20:17,160
including a friend of mine named Travis
brewer who competes on American Ninja

1546
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:20,100
Warrior and was actually one of my
park or teachers for the Tim Ferriss

1547
01:20:20,101 --> 01:20:23,090
experiment when I like
destroyed my entire body. Uh,

1548
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:27,900
but in a really fantastic coach
and just incredible, crazy athlete.

1549
01:20:28,380 --> 01:20:28,720
Um,

1550
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:33,720
and I'll do the same thing
when I am feeling rushed or
inclined to skip training

1551
01:20:34,441 --> 01:20:38,940
for whatever reason. I will
go on Instagram and check
those folks out. Very cool.

1552
01:20:39,090 --> 01:20:42,280
And there's like, do you follow
calisthenic kings are, uh,

1553
01:20:42,330 --> 01:20:43,740
there are a number of them.

1554
01:20:43,741 --> 01:20:47,370
There's like callous then knows
I think is a Greek Greek guy.

1555
01:20:47,650 --> 01:20:49,560
There are a bunch of them.
I mean, there's so many,

1556
01:20:49,561 --> 01:20:53,040
of course they're are only
maybe six to 10. There's a guy,

1557
01:20:53,041 --> 01:20:55,020
I want to say his name
is Trevor Blackwell.

1558
01:20:55,330 --> 01:20:59,490
I'm also following some Olympic weight
lifters or guys who do a Olympic lifts,

1559
01:20:59,850 --> 01:21:00,120
uh,

1560
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:03,510
who are beasts just because that's another
thing that I'm kind of focused on at

1561
01:21:03,511 --> 01:21:08,340
the moment. Uh, but, uh, that's a,
that's a much longer story. Uh, let's,

1562
01:21:08,341 --> 01:21:09,174
let's,

1563
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:14,240
let's flip gears a little bit and talk
about some of your business rules or

1564
01:21:15,331 --> 01:21:18,900
guidelines. Uh, and I know
you've, you've mentioned before,

1565
01:21:18,901 --> 01:21:20,410
I think the four one,

1566
01:21:20,411 --> 01:21:25,140
one a and I was hoping you could elaborate
on that and maybe talk about some of

1567
01:21:25,141 --> 01:21:27,540
your other guidelines
or rules that you have.

1568
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:29,120
Yemen,
uh,

1569
01:21:29,121 --> 01:21:31,610
so come back to some of the
business things that have
worked really well. I mean,

1570
01:21:32,060 --> 01:21:35,510
what I've learned, I'm
noticing my brothers, you know,
starting his own business.

1571
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:38,450
Um, and you know, Neville
as I've mentioned earlier,

1572
01:21:38,451 --> 01:21:39,850
is trying to get certain
things organizing.

1573
01:21:39,860 --> 01:21:43,190
I've realized that like simple rules are
actually the easiest way for you to be

1574
01:21:43,191 --> 01:21:47,000
successful. Uh, and so the four one one
is specifically for Appsumo and you could,

1575
01:21:47,001 --> 01:21:48,620
you know, apply to yourself,
but we basically were like,

1576
01:21:49,070 --> 01:21:50,960
how many deals do we need to
do a month to be successful?

1577
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:55,010
And then we can just follow that rule.
So for Appsumo, it's four one one,

1578
01:21:55,011 --> 01:21:57,950
which is just like four deals a month,
one free deal,

1579
01:21:58,100 --> 01:22:01,310
one promotion of an internal product
every month. And as long as we do that,

1580
01:22:01,340 --> 01:22:06,020
we're successful and that's for us.
But for yourselves listening,

1581
01:22:06,530 --> 01:22:07,730
how can you create simple rules?

1582
01:22:07,731 --> 01:22:11,030
Like once a week I have to do a blog
post once a week I have to make a sales

1583
01:22:11,031 --> 01:22:13,280
call and do the one, one, one thing,

1584
01:22:13,281 --> 01:22:15,110
which every week you do
with that one activity.

1585
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:17,570
And I've just noticed the more
that we have simple rules,

1586
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:20,390
it just makes it a lot easier for us
to be accomplishing those things and we

1587
01:22:20,391 --> 01:22:21,224
check in on them.

1588
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:24,110
And so it just makes it life a lot easier
and a lot more effective and likely

1589
01:22:24,111 --> 01:22:25,280
that there'll be accomplished.

1590
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:30,340
Do you use a Google spreadsheet or
project management stuff like a base camp?

1591
01:22:30,721 --> 01:22:33,500
We're in a sauna or Trello or whatever.

1592
01:22:33,501 --> 01:22:38,210
How do you actually keep on top of that
stuff with your team so that it doesn't

1593
01:22:38,211 --> 01:22:41,420
just get written down on a piece
of paper and lost along the way?

1594
01:22:42,450 --> 01:22:46,320
So I'll call it, I call it
the Susan Sue formula, uh,

1595
01:22:46,321 --> 01:22:49,530
or the angry Asian mother formula.
Anyone who you're talking to.

1596
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:53,210
So Susan sue is this five foot,
nothing Asian checkers,

1597
01:22:53,220 --> 01:22:55,380
like one of the most bad
chicks you'll ever meet.

1598
01:22:55,710 --> 01:22:58,920
And so she came and ran sales for us
for about a year or two years ago.

1599
01:22:59,250 --> 01:23:01,800
And what she did, and you know, they
do it, we do it on the sales team,

1600
01:23:01,801 --> 01:23:04,140
is that they check in every
morning and every evening.

1601
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:05,530
And so Susan's would be like,

1602
01:23:05,531 --> 01:23:07,630
what are three things you're going
to get done today? And if noonday,

1603
01:23:07,631 --> 01:23:11,260
what three things did you get done? And
that was, it's definitely a lot of work.

1604
01:23:11,261 --> 01:23:13,780
But I've been doing that with like Neville
is trying to grow his email list and

1605
01:23:13,781 --> 01:23:16,570
every morning, um, he's, you know,

1606
01:23:16,630 --> 01:23:18,580
he's going to be like a sure thing I'm
going to do at the end of the night.

1607
01:23:18,580 --> 01:23:19,450
He checks in with me.
He's like,

1608
01:23:19,451 --> 01:23:23,470
here's what I got done today and
here's my progress. And so what we do,

1609
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:26,740
what I recommend for most people though
is I do a once a week check in with

1610
01:23:26,770 --> 01:23:29,110
everybody personally.
And I find that to be the most helpful.

1611
01:23:29,140 --> 01:23:32,500
If you want to be Susan Su level,
do a daily in the morning and evening.

1612
01:23:32,530 --> 01:23:35,410
And that's insanely effective because
it's like, here's what I'm going to do.

1613
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:39,610
Here's what I got done. And you get
that stuff moving forward for sure.

1614
01:23:40,270 --> 01:23:45,250
Um, for me on Appsumo at a higher
level, I check in every week. Uh,

1615
01:23:45,340 --> 01:23:49,180
generally I just check in on person and
we have a dashboard that we check in

1616
01:23:49,210 --> 01:23:50,043
every day.

1617
01:23:50,850 --> 01:23:54,900
Is the dashboard in Google apps or
what does the text, and for that,

1618
01:23:55,290 --> 01:23:57,690
the dashboard, you're going to be pretty
smart. It's literally something we made.

1619
01:23:57,691 --> 01:23:59,840
It's just one number. So
I'll tell you, for tsunami,

1620
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:03,330
our goal is to make a million
dollar revenue business this year.

1621
01:24:03,510 --> 01:24:05,550
So that's our goal for the business.

1622
01:24:05,551 --> 01:24:08,370
And so we have a target of how much
money you need to make a month,

1623
01:24:08,371 --> 01:24:13,260
which is $83,000. And then
we know how, so the, that,

1624
01:24:13,300 --> 01:24:17,250
that website is literally just
what is our revenue against that.

1625
01:24:17,490 --> 01:24:20,280
It's literally one number.
And if you ask anybody in our company,

1626
01:24:20,610 --> 01:24:23,170
like actually I'm kind of curious
to ask him, uh, I don't know,

1627
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:27,540
walk into the interview, but if I have,
I'll ask him my chief chat right now. Uh,

1628
01:24:27,570 --> 01:24:29,850
what is our team goal for the year?

1629
01:24:30,180 --> 01:24:32,820
And this is something I learned from
Zuckerberg in terms of how to get things

1630
01:24:32,821 --> 01:24:35,370
organized.
I don't try to organize everything.

1631
01:24:35,820 --> 01:24:38,670
I try to focus on what's my number
one goal. And that's what Zuck did,

1632
01:24:38,940 --> 01:24:41,670
which is the number one goal
for him was growth. And I think,

1633
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:42,990
I don't know if I mentioned
the story to you before,

1634
01:24:42,991 --> 01:24:46,820
but I went to Zuck trying to get him to
make money every telling the story. No,

1635
01:24:46,850 --> 01:24:49,020
no, I'd love to hear it. I
went to and I was like, dude,

1636
01:24:49,140 --> 01:24:52,890
Facebook needs to be real business
one day. Uh, let's make some money.

1637
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:56,100
Don't you want to like stay
in the business and make a
lot of money for so that

1638
01:24:56,101 --> 01:24:59,700
we can, you know, be a company one day
and really profit. And he's like, no,

1639
01:24:59,710 --> 01:25:01,890
does that help us grow? I'm like,
no, no, I won't it this girl,

1640
01:25:01,891 --> 01:25:04,470
but it'll help us make money and make,
you know, make a business. He's like,

1641
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:06,420
does it help us grow?
You know?

1642
01:25:06,780 --> 01:25:10,440
And so what he did that I've applied at
my businesses and that's all I ever do

1643
01:25:10,441 --> 01:25:11,040
now,

1644
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:14,820
is that I pick one's very specific goal
and I check on it and a regular basis.

1645
01:25:14,821 --> 01:25:17,220
So as an example,
let me just break down the sumo me one.

1646
01:25:17,221 --> 01:25:18,570
Our goal is $1 million a year.

1647
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:23,100
I have a spreadsheet that breaks out
how much money that is each month.

1648
01:25:23,700 --> 01:25:26,070
And then we have our dashboard that
shows it every day about how we're

1649
01:25:26,071 --> 01:25:29,280
progressing towards it. And on a
every month on the first of the month,

1650
01:25:29,310 --> 01:25:32,670
I just check how we did against what I
projected that we need to be doing to hit

1651
01:25:32,671 --> 01:25:36,570
our goal. And so everyone is focused
around that one goal and nothing else.

1652
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:40,550
So I,
I love this and this is,

1653
01:25:40,580 --> 01:25:45,580
this is something that when
I'm say interviewing people
and trying to obviously

1654
01:25:45,831 --> 01:25:48,770
pick up lots of things
that I can use myself.

1655
01:25:48,771 --> 01:25:53,000
I mean this is not just for publication.
I like talking to people like you.

1656
01:25:53,001 --> 01:25:56,510
So I can pick up new book,
recommendations, tools, approaches,

1657
01:25:56,870 --> 01:26:00,380
and this is very consistent. Uh,
when you look at the very top, top,

1658
01:26:00,381 --> 01:26:04,040
top performers where for instance,
uh, we mentioned teal earlier

1659
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:07,160
and, uh, who is not only a billionaire,

1660
01:26:07,161 --> 01:26:10,490
but he's done it several times over in
different ways. I mean, that's very,

1661
01:26:10,491 --> 01:26:15,470
very hard to do. And he was a famous, uh,

1662
01:26:15,471 --> 01:26:19,360
it, it, it turns out, and this could
be apocryphal, I don't know if it's,

1663
01:26:19,370 --> 01:26:20,240
if it's totally true,

1664
01:26:20,241 --> 01:26:25,241
but I think it is that at paypal he gave
every person one top objective and it

1665
01:26:26,781 --> 01:26:27,950
was a measurable objective.

1666
01:26:27,951 --> 01:26:32,150
And if they came to him for like an
office hours type of meeting or pull them

1667
01:26:32,151 --> 01:26:34,820
aside to ask him a question about
like, why don't we do this? Or Hey,

1668
01:26:34,821 --> 01:26:38,210
I need some help with such and such,
he would ask them,

1669
01:26:38,390 --> 01:26:42,110
how does this contribute to
your number one priority x?

1670
01:26:42,380 --> 01:26:45,650
And like how is it driving the numbers
forward? And if it was not related,

1671
01:26:45,651 --> 01:26:46,730
he wouldn't talk to them about it.

1672
01:26:48,580 --> 01:26:52,860
That's exactly right. I mean, that's
what we do at up soon. I just, uh, for,

1673
01:26:52,861 --> 01:26:55,600
for the Sumito comm product, I asked our
team, I just, clothes aren't team chat.

1674
01:26:55,930 --> 01:26:59,300
You know, what's our goal for the year?
And it will, the guy was joking me to put,

1675
01:26:59,420 --> 01:27:03,130
you know, 100,000 monthly recurring
potatoes. Uh, his nickname is potato.

1676
01:27:03,131 --> 01:27:05,320
So that's what he calls money.
Um,

1677
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:08,770
but everyone on the team knows everyone
is aligned and for have similar.

1678
01:27:08,771 --> 01:27:13,210
In the past it was like last year was
a billion people seeing sumo me.com and

1679
01:27:13,211 --> 01:27:13,540
we've got to,

1680
01:27:13,540 --> 01:27:17,020
we hit a bit like a year before it was
$1 million a month in one k.com which we

1681
01:27:17,021 --> 01:27:19,180
did for those half a
million email subscribers.

1682
01:27:19,630 --> 01:27:21,700
And the point is not that well
no it gets everything done.

1683
01:27:21,940 --> 01:27:23,560
It's just I don't do anything else.

1684
01:27:24,180 --> 01:27:27,990
And that comes back to the essentialism,
a book that you were mentioning earlier,

1685
01:27:28,020 --> 01:27:29,790
which really kind of
drives that point home.

1686
01:27:30,820 --> 01:27:34,240
Yeah, I mean and obviously you have your
high level thing and you break it down.

1687
01:27:34,241 --> 01:27:37,360
So like I was telling you, I'm struggling
right now with, we have two customers,

1688
01:27:37,361 --> 01:27:40,030
we have small, medium business, self
serve and then we have enterprise.

1689
01:27:40,390 --> 01:27:42,830
And so I have to come
back and look at art,

1690
01:27:42,850 --> 01:27:45,190
which helps us accomplish our goal better.
And you know,

1691
01:27:45,220 --> 01:27:47,620
that's what I have to go and spend
time solving to then say, all right,

1692
01:27:47,621 --> 01:27:51,130
well what will help us go faster and
easier to hit that number one goal?

1693
01:27:51,250 --> 01:27:54,190
And then focus just on that and then
kind of keep going through that process.

1694
01:27:54,191 --> 01:27:57,460
Like right now I get interview
requests probably like every two days,

1695
01:27:57,461 --> 01:27:59,530
every three to hey, come talk to
my interview. And I'm like, well,

1696
01:27:59,531 --> 01:28:03,400
this helped me get to my goal faster
than doing another activity and it won't,

1697
01:28:03,401 --> 01:28:06,430
so I don't do it. And that's specifically
like this. And I'm like, yeah, okay, Tim,

1698
01:28:06,431 --> 01:28:07,120
you know,
Tim,

1699
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:09,520
a few people have heard of Tim Ferriss
and a lot of people will check this out.

1700
01:28:09,521 --> 01:28:13,030
So it will be significant to worth my
time to help me really accomplish my goal.

1701
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:14,980
Uh, and everyone on the
team is aligned with that.

1702
01:28:15,930 --> 01:28:20,320
So speaking of goals, I think a lot of
people have goals. They're like, you know,

1703
01:28:20,380 --> 01:28:24,040
yeah. That Noah Guy, he's been talking
about building an email list. Yeah,

1704
01:28:24,041 --> 01:28:25,780
I know he's helping devil,
I should really do that.

1705
01:28:26,170 --> 01:28:30,190
And they have the should do that.
And that's as far as it goes, right?

1706
01:28:30,191 --> 01:28:33,010
Maybe they take a note, maybe they put
it into their notes in their iPhone,

1707
01:28:33,011 --> 01:28:36,040
whatever. And that's where it lives
forever and it never gets implemented.

1708
01:28:36,041 --> 01:28:39,580
So you mentioned earlier that,
uh,

1709
01:28:39,610 --> 01:28:44,610
you would do a demo or basically give
people something they can do now to,

1710
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:49,330
to pump the ball down if the then down
the field a little bit and make some,

1711
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:53,680
some progress. And I think you
mentioned email subscribers, uh,

1712
01:28:54,010 --> 01:28:56,680
if I'm right, correct me if I'm
wrong, but w what is that exercise?

1713
01:28:57,610 --> 01:29:00,840
Oh Man. So as soon we.com is free
tools to get to grow your website.

1714
01:29:00,860 --> 01:29:04,360
So how to get a bigger email list,
how to get more shares and,

1715
01:29:04,610 --> 01:29:07,800
and just for people who are listening,
I use that on my blog.

1716
01:29:07,830 --> 01:29:11,850
And it's not because I do love you, but
it's not because I love you. Oh, Timothy.

1717
01:29:12,150 --> 01:29:14,400
Um, so here's what
we're going to do. Like,

1718
01:29:14,401 --> 01:29:16,770
I think one of the things that people
love about you and what I respect about

1719
01:29:16,771 --> 01:29:20,250
you is that you're about getting
shit done. Like, you know,

1720
01:29:20,251 --> 01:29:23,340
for our work is how do I get things done?
How do I do less work to get more,

1721
01:29:23,341 --> 01:29:25,440
even more things done? Uh, and you know,

1722
01:29:25,441 --> 01:29:28,080
you want to understand the elements of
those things and you're very curious and

1723
01:29:28,081 --> 01:29:32,400
very specific about that. Um, so, you
know, I'd love for you to listen to notes,

1724
01:29:32,401 --> 01:29:36,090
but anybody who does what I had to teach
them to do the highest result person,

1725
01:29:36,390 --> 01:29:37,200
we're going to do a giveaway.

1726
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:41,460
I'm going to pay for it where I will fly
you to hang out with me and our office

1727
01:29:41,490 --> 01:29:46,060
and put you up in a room. I'm not around
it. Know that sounds a little creepy. Uh,

1728
01:29:46,140 --> 01:29:49,020
and I will, you know, you can work with
us on any project you have for a day.

1729
01:29:49,021 --> 01:29:52,290
We'll get you Taco Deli for the person
who actually takes action because I know

1730
01:29:52,291 --> 01:29:53,880
for you that's really important to him.
And I want,

1731
01:29:53,890 --> 01:29:56,640
I don't want you to just listen
to this interview and not do shit.

1732
01:29:56,880 --> 01:29:59,550
I want you to listen to the interview,
take action, and make your life better.

1733
01:29:59,551 --> 01:30:02,010
That's what makes this
worth it for me. And, uh,

1734
01:30:02,090 --> 01:30:04,400
just so people have a context here,

1735
01:30:04,640 --> 01:30:07,340
what is the deadline for doing this?

1736
01:30:07,820 --> 01:30:10,250
Well, I'm going to give you things
that you can do in real time.

1737
01:30:10,460 --> 01:30:14,360
So I will say a week from when this goes
public because you should be able to do

1738
01:30:14,361 --> 01:30:17,330
those things within that day and
right now as you're listening.

1739
01:30:17,331 --> 01:30:19,910
So I would say if you're weak,
that's already long enough. Okay,

1740
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:23,470
got it. So I'll just say for guys and
obviously a void where prohibited, blah,

1741
01:30:23,471 --> 01:30:26,780
blah, blah, you can't be mandatory.
You need to be over 18 years of age.

1742
01:30:26,781 --> 01:30:31,600
You can't be a whatever. You could
take over the prices, right? Man, blah,

1743
01:30:31,601 --> 01:30:35,240
blah, blah, blah, Blah and uh, no,
no purchase necessary, all that shit.

1744
01:30:35,330 --> 01:30:37,400
And none at all. There's
actually, it's totally free.

1745
01:30:37,401 --> 01:30:40,520
And what I want to teach people is how
to start a business or how to share your

1746
01:30:40,521 --> 01:30:41,360
message with the world.

1747
01:30:41,420 --> 01:30:45,510
Instantly if even if you don't have
anything cool right now and the,

1748
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:47,030
and so the person who does the most,

1749
01:30:47,031 --> 01:30:50,240
you're going to fly them to Austin
and show them a good time and uh,

1750
01:30:50,270 --> 01:30:51,380
perhaps free cuddles,

1751
01:30:52,120 --> 01:30:56,080
always cuddle this dude bro.
Hugs, Bro. Hugs. Well, so here's,

1752
01:30:56,710 --> 01:31:00,230
let me just start with like, you know,
we did this monthly one k product, uh,

1753
01:31:00,350 --> 01:31:02,430
when they, when Kate icon to show people
how to start a business and you know,

1754
01:31:02,440 --> 01:31:05,650
5,000 plus people and I've
been able to help a lot. Um,

1755
01:31:05,740 --> 01:31:07,780
and a lot of people are like,
why do I start?

1756
01:31:08,260 --> 01:31:10,360
And I think the two things I want to
say is either if you want to start a

1757
01:31:10,361 --> 01:31:13,780
business or if you just wanna get your
message out there started now so that

1758
01:31:13,781 --> 01:31:15,280
whenever you want to do in the future,
I know Tim,

1759
01:31:15,281 --> 01:31:18,640
I actually read when I was studying all
you your popular interviews to figure

1760
01:31:18,641 --> 01:31:21,280
out what stuff you're out into. We want
to hear. And you would actually said, hey,

1761
01:31:21,281 --> 01:31:24,460
I wish I had an email as sooner so that
as you have books or things you want to

1762
01:31:24,461 --> 01:31:27,400
promote or get out there, you can have
direct communication with your audience.

1763
01:31:28,150 --> 01:31:31,450
So I want to specifically show how anyone
listening right now can get a hundred

1764
01:31:31,451 --> 01:31:34,630
people on an email list for free
so that when they have a message,

1765
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:35,680
they can get it out instantly.

1766
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:37,820
Yeah, let's go. Let's rock and roll.

1767
01:31:38,120 --> 01:31:38,361
All right.

1768
01:31:38,361 --> 01:31:40,820
So whoever gets the most of their email
list within the week from when this goes

1769
01:31:40,821 --> 01:31:43,050
live, I will fly you out and
pay for food, pay for hotel,

1770
01:31:43,100 --> 01:31:47,090
and help you with whatever business
stuff you want to be helped with. So,

1771
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:48,530
all right. So here's what we're
gonna do. You have a phone,

1772
01:31:48,531 --> 01:31:51,170
you listen to this podcast. Is that how
most people listen to the podcast in?

1773
01:31:51,890 --> 01:31:54,960
I think a lot of people are listening
on their phones. Maybe not exclusively,

1774
01:31:54,961 --> 01:31:58,590
but on whatever device. But let's, let's
just say you have a phone handy. Sure.

1775
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:00,220
All right.
So if you're on your phone,

1776
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:01,420
I'm speaking right into the microphone.

1777
01:32:01,421 --> 01:32:04,240
Come back to your phone or
if you're on your computer,

1778
01:32:04,241 --> 01:32:07,450
come back to the computer
and hang out the, all right.

1779
01:32:07,451 --> 01:32:10,150
So I want you to grab your phone
and here's what we're gonna do. The,

1780
01:32:10,180 --> 01:32:12,550
I want you to get a hundred subscribers
and I'll just say it again cause I think

1781
01:32:12,551 --> 01:32:14,710
it's important.
If you want a hundred subscribers,

1782
01:32:14,711 --> 01:32:17,950
it's so that if you ever want to start a
business or if you ever want to promote

1783
01:32:17,951 --> 01:32:19,030
something or share your message,

1784
01:32:19,031 --> 01:32:22,060
even start it now so you can
do it whenever you're ready.

1785
01:32:22,690 --> 01:32:25,270
Instead of waiting until later and
not doing anything which will pop,

1786
01:32:25,271 --> 01:32:28,000
it will piss me off. So if you
want to get a hundred subscribers,

1787
01:32:28,001 --> 01:32:31,570
here's what I want you to do. Choose any
topic you're interested in, like Tim,

1788
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:35,230
let's actually, we'll do it. I'll do
it live right now as well. What's a,

1789
01:32:35,260 --> 01:32:36,490
what's a topic that you're interested in,
Tim?

1790
01:32:36,550 --> 01:32:39,340
Like something recently that you've been
thinking about or reading or curious

1791
01:32:39,341 --> 01:32:39,830
about?

1792
01:32:39,830 --> 01:32:42,570
Interested in the ketogenic diet,
which is like the,

1793
01:32:42,810 --> 01:32:45,100
Oh, the Kido thing. Yeah.
I'm interested in that. I'm,

1794
01:32:45,150 --> 01:32:47,580
I'm really digging deep in that right now.
Okay.

1795
01:32:47,581 --> 01:32:50,490
So would you want to
start a new newsletter?

1796
01:32:51,230 --> 01:32:53,970
Uh, I am trouble. I
probably have my hands full.

1797
01:32:54,680 --> 01:32:57,110
You're a little busy. All right. Yeah,
I will do the Kido topic newsletter.

1798
01:32:57,111 --> 01:32:59,960
I will get a hundred people right now
on it so that I can share that message

1799
01:32:59,961 --> 01:33:03,250
with other people. And then maybe I
can say that Tim likes the Quito died.

1800
01:33:03,910 --> 01:33:06,220
So choose a topic that you're
curious about, interested in.

1801
01:33:06,240 --> 01:33:09,080
You want to talk about the certain
people. Here's what I want you to do. Tim,

1802
01:33:09,081 --> 01:33:09,914
do you have your phone on you?

1803
01:33:10,530 --> 01:33:10,920
Uh,

1804
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:15,920
I have my phone off because I didn't want
it to interfere with what we are doing

1805
01:33:17,041 --> 01:33:17,350
here.

1806
01:33:17,350 --> 01:33:20,530
Okay. Attention to me, so that's good.
All right, well for whoever's listening,

1807
01:33:20,531 --> 01:33:22,330
here's what we're going to do.
I'm going to take a photo of myself.

1808
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:26,890
So take a photo of yourself now.
I want you to go to your social networks

1809
01:33:27,120 --> 01:33:30,750
and I'll, I'll post all this stuff
on a, in the blog post to also,

1810
01:33:30,751 --> 01:33:32,600
which I'll get people in Finland,
but continue to,

1811
01:33:32,690 --> 01:33:35,890
and here's what people are going to say.
Well no one Tim have followers or fuck,

1812
01:33:35,900 --> 01:33:38,870
who cares about followers? Even if you
have 100 people, don't worry about that.

1813
01:33:39,100 --> 01:33:43,220
It doesn't matter if you have 10 a
hundred or five, take a photo of yourself.

1814
01:33:43,221 --> 01:33:47,200
Now I want you to post it on your
social sites, Facebook and Google,

1815
01:33:47,390 --> 01:33:49,640
Facebook and Twitter.
So right and don't even,

1816
01:33:49,641 --> 01:33:52,400
you don't have to sign up for service.
No, we don't have an email list. I guess.

1817
01:33:52,401 --> 01:33:54,260
What's an email list? Provider? Gmail.

1818
01:33:55,460 --> 01:33:58,070
That's a great way to start
your newsletter so that
you know I just to give you

1819
01:33:58,071 --> 01:34:02,600
a context like absolutely as a high seven
figure business and 90% plus just come

1820
01:34:02,601 --> 01:34:05,180
from an email list.
So just to give you context about,

1821
01:34:05,260 --> 01:34:08,900
oh you actually can just be email
is kin create large businesses.

1822
01:34:09,110 --> 01:34:13,640
So posting your social, I'm starting a
newsletter and then attach your photo.

1823
01:34:15,290 --> 01:34:18,920
You're going to see my photo on Noah
Kagan and then say email me and then put

1824
01:34:18,921 --> 01:34:23,840
your email. So I'm going to do mine
about Kido cause I'm curious about Quito.

1825
01:34:24,230 --> 01:34:27,710
Email me Noah or I'll put Quito at,
okay.

1826
01:34:27,711 --> 01:34:31,820
dork.com and this will go to my inbox
and now I will get a list of people who

1827
01:34:31,821 --> 01:34:35,720
will be curious about Kido.
So it didn't cost me any money.

1828
01:34:35,721 --> 01:34:37,340
It took me about two seconds.
So if you're on your phone,

1829
01:34:37,341 --> 01:34:39,260
take a photo of yourself,
go to your Twitter,

1830
01:34:39,730 --> 01:34:42,740
and then I'm going to go to my Facebook
and just post it socially and starting a

1831
01:34:42,741 --> 01:34:44,600
newsletter about Kito Kito at,
okay.

1832
01:34:44,601 --> 01:34:49,490
dork.com and so I just tweeted that and
now people are going to start emailing

1833
01:34:49,491 --> 01:34:53,550
me about Kido.
And so that's one tick tactic.

1834
01:34:53,551 --> 01:34:55,530
So we're going to do with two more,
uh,

1835
01:34:55,531 --> 01:34:57,000
and then you will
actually probably have a,

1836
01:34:57,290 --> 01:34:59,960
if not more people interested
in what you want to talk about.

1837
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:03,080
So if you want to sell them something or
if you just want to put out information.

1838
01:35:03,260 --> 01:35:06,790
One thing I've noticed him is that
one tactic that I do is in my, okay,

1839
01:35:06,791 --> 01:35:09,590
dork.com newsletter. I have an auto
reply. When people join that say,

1840
01:35:09,620 --> 01:35:10,970
what's one thing I can help you with?

1841
01:35:11,510 --> 01:35:15,980
And then they tell me their questions and
that's actually businesses. People say,

1842
01:35:15,981 --> 01:35:17,240
Hey, no, I want help with this.

1843
01:35:17,241 --> 01:35:20,540
And basically you just look for the
pattern of what the constant questions

1844
01:35:20,541 --> 01:35:22,820
people keep asking you and
you say, hey, email this.

1845
01:35:22,821 --> 01:35:24,680
I'm going to create a book about this.
It's 10 bucks.

1846
01:35:25,070 --> 01:35:29,090
You pay me via paypal and I go make it
and this is what I've taught 5,000 people

1847
01:35:29,091 --> 01:35:32,510
in. And they do it and they
get businesses. The Problem
Tim, is people are like,

1848
01:35:32,511 --> 01:35:35,600
it can't be that easy because they're
looking for some magic bullet or some

1849
01:35:35,601 --> 01:35:38,270
golden trick or something more
complicated, but it's not.

1850
01:35:38,330 --> 01:35:40,460
It starts with one customer
and helping one person.

1851
01:35:40,700 --> 01:35:42,830
And this is the way you can actually
start it while you're listening to the

1852
01:35:42,831 --> 01:35:46,400
podcasts instead of waiting to eventually
start your business. Definitely.

1853
01:35:46,550 --> 01:35:49,850
No, I stay, I and I've seen, uh, you know,

1854
01:35:49,880 --> 01:35:52,490
there are people out there like Neil
Patel has done some very similar stuff,

1855
01:35:52,491 --> 01:35:53,810
right? I mean he's, he,
he's, he's been like,

1856
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:58,400
pay me this and then I will
add you to this email list.

1857
01:35:58,401 --> 01:36:01,850
It's so simple and makes a ton
of money. I mean, there are,

1858
01:36:02,060 --> 01:36:05,870
it doesn't have to be complicated.
In fact, if it is really complicated,

1859
01:36:06,090 --> 01:36:07,790
it probably not the right answer.

1860
01:36:07,791 --> 01:36:10,100
So you said there were a couple of
other things that people should yes.

1861
01:36:10,150 --> 01:36:10,990
So you posted it,

1862
01:36:10,991 --> 01:36:14,410
I posted them on Twitter and then
posted on your Facebook and have people

1863
01:36:14,411 --> 01:36:17,830
emailing you to subscribe. That's number
one. And they just email you don't need,

1864
01:36:18,310 --> 01:36:20,500
you don't need any software,
you don't need to sign up for MailChimp,

1865
01:36:20,501 --> 01:36:23,890
which is free, but that's complicated.
Just keep it really simple. Secondly,

1866
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:28,120
go to your email signature. So
Tim, for you on your settings,

1867
01:36:28,750 --> 01:36:30,460
on your phone.
So if you have an iPhone goes,

1868
01:36:30,490 --> 01:36:35,380
I don't even know what android who uses
android. Um, but on iPhone go to settings,

1869
01:36:35,410 --> 01:36:39,970
male and scroll to the bottom to your
signature on your signature to say,

1870
01:36:40,450 --> 01:36:44,140
reply to me if you want
the latest tips on Kido.

1871
01:36:45,490 --> 01:36:46,930
And so if you already have a mailing list,

1872
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:49,900
make sure you update your signature on
all your accounts on a regular basis.

1873
01:36:49,901 --> 01:36:51,140
So unlike my personal one,
it says,

1874
01:36:51,141 --> 01:36:55,000
come eat tacos with me and people click
it all the time and then it's like, oh,

1875
01:36:55,001 --> 01:36:56,020
you should join my newsletter.

1876
01:36:56,470 --> 01:37:00,160
Basically what I try to recommend people
as you're starting businesses is keep

1877
01:37:00,161 --> 01:37:03,700
it as simple as possible. Don't spend as
much money as possible and importantly,

1878
01:37:03,701 --> 01:37:06,590
leverage the assets you already
have available. When most people,

1879
01:37:06,620 --> 01:37:10,510
Tim don't realize is that they have
at least 50 to 200 people minimum on

1880
01:37:10,511 --> 01:37:14,380
linkedin. That could be potential
customers, but they think, oh,

1881
01:37:14,381 --> 01:37:15,820
I've got to do like a Facebook ad,

1882
01:37:15,850 --> 01:37:18,430
which is going to cost you money
and I want to discourage that.

1883
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:20,950
And so I'm trying to say,
how do you already have assets?

1884
01:37:20,951 --> 01:37:23,050
Do you already have a church group?
Do you already have a Facebook group?

1885
01:37:23,051 --> 01:37:24,020
Do you already have,
uh,

1886
01:37:24,130 --> 01:37:27,520
your colleagues that you can use Azure
customers to join your newsletter and

1887
01:37:27,521 --> 01:37:29,800
eventually make a business out
of it? Cause you could say, Hey,

1888
01:37:29,801 --> 01:37:31,660
I'm creating something. You
should buy it. And guess what?

1889
01:37:31,661 --> 01:37:34,890
Now you have access to these people
via your newsletter. Is this,

1890
01:37:34,900 --> 01:37:36,000
is this connecting?
Yeah.

1891
01:37:36,040 --> 01:37:37,660
I can't sell it because I'm talking
to myself a little bit. Yeah,

1892
01:37:37,710 --> 01:37:40,470
no, no, no. This, this all makes
sense. And I want to give a,

1893
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:44,280
just a quick text suggestion for
people who might be like, oh my God,

1894
01:37:44,281 --> 01:37:48,540
but I don't have, you know, let's
just say your name is, uh, whatever.

1895
01:37:48,570 --> 01:37:53,190
Bob Jones. So I don't have a
Bob jones.com domain. I don't,

1896
01:37:53,220 --> 01:37:56,580
I can't, I don't know how to
create a kito@bobjones.com

1897
01:37:56,580 --> 01:38:00,750
email address. Uh, a workaround for
that, which a lot of people don't.

1898
01:38:00,751 --> 01:38:04,680
It's so simple and I couldn't believe
how useful that says when you figure it

1899
01:38:04,681 --> 01:38:07,500
out. If your email
addresses, let's just say

1900
01:38:07,501 --> 01:38:12,501
bobJones@gmaildotcomifyoucreatebobjonesplusanythingyourightatgmail.com
your

1901
01:38:15,361 --> 01:38:19,140
email, we'll still get delivered.
So you could, you could put, Hey,

1902
01:38:19,150 --> 01:38:24,060
I'm on Twitter, you can say I'm
starting a Kito newsletter. Email me at,

1903
01:38:24,510 --> 01:38:24,900
uh,

1904
01:38:24,900 --> 01:38:29,900
Bob Jones plus symbol kido@gmail.com
if you want to join people email that.

1905
01:38:31,141 --> 01:38:35,190
And it allows, it then allows you
to search by that email and sort.

1906
01:38:35,630 --> 01:38:38,670
Uh,
and you don't have to set up anything new.

1907
01:38:38,730 --> 01:38:42,240
You're just using a plus sign and some
kind of identifier before the ad symbol.

1908
01:38:42,750 --> 01:38:46,170
Um, super, super useful.
And Expedia, Expedia,

1909
01:38:46,350 --> 01:38:50,760
you can also do for this is if you're
signing up for a new service or anything,

1910
01:38:50,761 --> 01:38:53,860
a newsletter you can put plus
and then some identifier.

1911
01:38:53,860 --> 01:38:58,800
So it's like if I sign up for, you
know, but whatever, super, super, uh,

1912
01:38:59,640 --> 01:39:04,620
you know, underoos
heroes.com and, uh, I'm like,

1913
01:39:04,621 --> 01:39:05,250
you know,

1914
01:39:05,250 --> 01:39:08,400
I wonder if these guys are going to spam
me and I want to know if they do or if

1915
01:39:08,401 --> 01:39:10,110
they sell my information
or anything like that.

1916
01:39:10,140 --> 01:39:15,140
I want to be able to automatically send
it to trash without giving them my real

1917
01:39:15,660 --> 01:39:19,410
email address. Right? So
bobJones@gmail.com that's
valuable information.

1918
01:39:19,411 --> 01:39:23,550
I don't want to be getting shit from
all sorts of people potentially if they

1919
01:39:23,551 --> 01:39:25,370
leak my information. So I'll, I'll,

1920
01:39:25,371 --> 01:39:30,371
I'll put Bob Jones plus you know under
is@gmail.com and that way I know if my

1921
01:39:33,001 --> 01:39:34,560
information has been leaked and I can,

1922
01:39:34,650 --> 01:39:38,460
I can just junk that email address and
have it all go to spam for instance.

1923
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:42,060
So that exactly that plus approach,
it's super helpful.

1924
01:39:42,260 --> 01:39:43,730
I don't think enough people know that one.

1925
01:39:43,790 --> 01:39:47,090
The other thing I would add to that as
do the plus filter and do that and then

1926
01:39:47,091 --> 01:39:51,410
in your settings create uh,
filters. Do you create this?

1927
01:39:51,411 --> 01:39:54,530
So I would, I would do for
all these people in Gmail is,

1928
01:39:54,920 --> 01:39:57,200
I don't know these other services
and most people use Gmail,

1929
01:39:57,201 --> 01:40:01,670
but in labs of GML and your settings lab
turn on canned responses and enable it.

1930
01:40:02,870 --> 01:40:07,010
Then what you do is create a filter.
So whenever,

1931
01:40:07,011 --> 01:40:10,720
and you can do this in a search box
really easily. So I said Kido at, okay,

1932
01:40:10,721 --> 01:40:12,560
dork.com or I could do my email address,

1933
01:40:12,561 --> 01:40:16,430
which is Noah Kagan plus quito@gmail.com
which is what Tim was suggesting to you.

1934
01:40:16,820 --> 01:40:20,450
And so what you do is you searched
to at, you know Quito at, okay,

1935
01:40:20,451 --> 01:40:22,280
dork.com and I've already got Tim,

1936
01:40:22,281 --> 01:40:24,950
I already got a two people
emailing me for the newsletter.

1937
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:26,433
That's fantastic.

1938
01:40:26,760 --> 01:40:30,000
And so what you do here is you click the
little down Arrow and you click filter

1939
01:40:30,001 --> 01:40:34,830
messages like these and you create a
filter like this or it now it says,

1940
01:40:35,050 --> 01:40:36,540
you know,
create a filter with this search.

1941
01:40:36,780 --> 01:40:40,020
And what I would do here is I
have a canned response that, look,

1942
01:40:40,021 --> 01:40:41,400
I know you're going to
create any software,

1943
01:40:41,700 --> 01:40:43,710
so send a canned response and
the camera's sponsor would be,

1944
01:40:43,800 --> 01:40:46,950
when I create that's like, Hey, what are
you interested into learning about Kido?

1945
01:40:47,430 --> 01:40:50,310
And they would just tell me what I should
be creating for them and possibly even

1946
01:40:50,311 --> 01:40:51,300
selling them in the future.

1947
01:40:52,180 --> 01:40:54,970
Definitely. And, and I want to point
out just a couple of things. Well,

1948
01:40:54,971 --> 01:40:55,810
actually before I do that,

1949
01:40:56,110 --> 01:40:59,740
are there any other steps
or recommendations and then
I have just a couple of

1950
01:40:59,741 --> 01:41:04,741
observations that I think might be
helpful for people who might find this

1951
01:41:06,221 --> 01:41:08,020
intimidating?
Yeah.

1952
01:41:08,230 --> 01:41:11,440
What I want you to do is if you have
a phone, you can do this right now.

1953
01:41:11,441 --> 01:41:13,330
If you're listening as podcasts,
you don't have to go anywhere else,

1954
01:41:13,331 --> 01:41:16,840
you don't have to pay for anything and
you could start your business instantly,

1955
01:41:16,841 --> 01:41:18,490
which I've never seen anyone do before,

1956
01:41:18,670 --> 01:41:20,770
but you can do with the technology
we have available for free.

1957
01:41:21,070 --> 01:41:24,040
So number one posted on your social
posted on Facebook and Twitter.

1958
01:41:24,041 --> 01:41:26,020
I put a photo cause it's
a little more a parent.

1959
01:41:26,021 --> 01:41:28,810
Maybe you want to put a little more text
and just give them the email address to

1960
01:41:28,840 --> 01:41:31,280
email you to join on your signature.
I wrote this Tim,

1961
01:41:31,281 --> 01:41:32,130
which I think you'll appreciate.

1962
01:41:32,131 --> 01:41:35,830
It says for all my signature on my phone
it says reply to me with a hell yes if

1963
01:41:35,831 --> 01:41:39,220
you want the latest Kido
News. I like it. I like,

1964
01:41:39,221 --> 01:41:42,010
and I've actually used it in some of
our sales collateral and it works really

1965
01:41:42,011 --> 01:41:44,560
well because we were like, Oh hell
yes. Sure. And so now I'm going to,

1966
01:41:44,860 --> 01:41:47,410
I do it for sales, but you can put in
your signature and now that's done.

1967
01:41:47,530 --> 01:41:50,440
So in every 50 emails I
send every day on average,

1968
01:41:50,950 --> 01:41:55,210
I now have probably about two to five of
them being like, oh yeah, cool. Hell yes.

1969
01:41:55,211 --> 01:41:57,400
I'm like, what do you
tell yessing about? Um,

1970
01:41:57,430 --> 01:41:59,890
but set up your filter and they get
the reply and then now you have the

1971
01:41:59,891 --> 01:42:04,840
questions to be answering. The last
thing I would say that is really cool.

1972
01:42:04,841 --> 01:42:07,880
It's go to your team. Do you have
favorites on your phone? Yeah. Yeah.

1973
01:42:08,100 --> 01:42:10,360
I'm actually really curious. That's
fascinating. Who's on your favorites? Man?

1974
01:42:11,100 --> 01:42:15,130
My phone is off, so I'm not sure. No. You
know who's on your phone? Act like that?

1975
01:42:15,420 --> 01:42:18,040
Who's are your favorites? No, no, I'm not
sure. Honestly, I'd have to look at it.

1976
01:42:19,140 --> 01:42:21,940
I know I'm not, I don't talk to you that
often, but uh, like all my favorites.

1977
01:42:21,940 --> 01:42:24,280
This is just like my brother and
my girlfriend. A few other people.

1978
01:42:24,390 --> 01:42:26,240
I like my coworkers.
Um,

1979
01:42:26,530 --> 01:42:29,770
go to your favorites cause it's the
easiest one not to have to think about and

1980
01:42:29,771 --> 01:42:33,250
just click on their names
and then text them. Hey Man,

1981
01:42:33,251 --> 01:42:35,710
can I send you information about
Kido? It's cool. Died information.

1982
01:42:36,220 --> 01:42:39,130
What I want to go back to that point that
was critical and I thought most people

1983
01:42:39,131 --> 01:42:41,380
are probably ignores it. Just go to
the people that already like you.

1984
01:42:42,010 --> 01:42:44,860
If they won't even buy from your industry,
from you, it's only gonna get harder.

1985
01:42:46,150 --> 01:42:49,650
It will not be easier. And what
I want to do is you, you know,

1986
01:42:49,720 --> 01:42:51,100
you took your assets,
you used it,

1987
01:42:51,101 --> 01:42:54,320
you had set up some passive things like
your signature and texting people that

1988
01:42:54,321 --> 01:42:57,340
are your favorites. And if they don't
know someone, then you ask for a referral.

1989
01:42:57,510 --> 01:42:57,811
And men,

1990
01:42:57,811 --> 01:43:00,490
do you know any person that's like a
fatty or anyone who's like crazy into

1991
01:43:00,491 --> 01:43:03,850
health that might be interested in
Quito News? And this is just basic,

1992
01:43:03,851 --> 01:43:05,560
obviously we can get more
fancy and complicated,

1993
01:43:05,770 --> 01:43:08,380
but this is the way that it starts.
This is how you get that first customer.

1994
01:43:08,381 --> 01:43:11,320
That's how you start the Facebook
or Google or Amazon or Microsoft.

1995
01:43:12,470 --> 01:43:16,430
No, I didn't. Then I started interject
this one to say to people, a few things.

1996
01:43:16,431 --> 01:43:21,431
Number one is keep in mind you
can always abandoned the project.

1997
01:43:21,501 --> 01:43:23,780
I think a lot of people were like, wow,
but I don't know how to run a newsletter.

1998
01:43:23,781 --> 01:43:26,600
I don't really want to commit to
another part time job. Oh my God.

1999
01:43:26,601 --> 01:43:29,720
Like what happens if blah, what happens if
this, what happens that it's like, look,

2000
01:43:29,721 --> 01:43:32,450
you can always just send an email
to these people would be like, hey,

2001
01:43:33,010 --> 01:43:36,440
had a huge fire pop up. The kido
newsletter's going to have to wait.

2002
01:43:36,441 --> 01:43:39,890
Sorry guys might have more newsletter
and then you're done. You don't have,

2003
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:44,840
it's not a major life commitment that
you're not going to be that you're not

2004
01:43:44,841 --> 01:43:48,560
getting married to the newsletter.
A and like an Irish Catholic family.

2005
01:43:48,561 --> 01:43:52,010
I mean it's like you,
you have options here and it happened to

2006
01:43:52,010 --> 01:43:54,380
me,
him to happened to me six months ago.

2007
01:43:54,381 --> 01:43:57,110
I started an events business to show
people how to start an events business

2008
01:43:57,140 --> 01:43:59,390
where I sold tickets and then I
made events. And then I was like,

2009
01:43:59,750 --> 01:44:02,060
I kind of don't want to keep doing events
cause I'm trying to run appsumo and

2010
01:44:02,061 --> 01:44:05,180
sumo me. And so I just refunded the
difference to people and it, you know,

2011
01:44:05,390 --> 01:44:08,390
it's very straight forward all always
with integrity and just letting people

2012
01:44:08,391 --> 01:44:09,224
know their expectations.

2013
01:44:09,250 --> 01:44:13,930
And just, just to actually add another
example. So I've done this many,

2014
01:44:13,931 --> 01:44:18,190
many times and sometimes things don't work
out or you don't like it and you quit.

2015
01:44:18,191 --> 01:44:19,990
So I tried to make a membership site,

2016
01:44:20,020 --> 01:44:24,940
a very inexpensive membership site as an
experiment ages ago for $10 a month or

2017
01:44:24,941 --> 01:44:29,080
something like that. And it turned
out that I just, at least at the time,

2018
01:44:29,081 --> 01:44:31,930
didn't like managing it and
the technology wasn't great.

2019
01:44:31,931 --> 01:44:35,170
So the experience wasn't perfect.
And I was like, you know,

2020
01:44:35,890 --> 01:44:38,260
just don't want to do this anymore.
It's too much psychic drain.

2021
01:44:38,261 --> 01:44:41,190
It's not worth the trouble.
So I refunded everybody and there were,

2022
01:44:41,191 --> 01:44:44,530
there were several, several hundred
people probably refunded everybody,

2023
01:44:44,531 --> 01:44:48,460
everything that they'd spent. And just
shut the thing down. And uh, you all,

2024
01:44:48,461 --> 01:44:52,180
you almost always have that option. But
there are other things like the podcast,

2025
01:44:52,181 --> 01:44:54,730
I was like, you know what, I'm not sure
if I'm going to like this internally.

2026
01:44:54,730 --> 01:44:57,640
I'm going to commit to doing six
episodes as an experiment and then I'll

2027
01:44:57,641 --> 01:45:00,340
reassess it and I might ditch it and
they'll just be like my mini series of

2028
01:45:00,341 --> 01:45:04,860
podcasts and it worked out. So
I kept on doing it. Um, the, um,

2029
01:45:04,980 --> 01:45:09,810
so to bring it back to the competition
then for those people who are listening,

2030
01:45:09,830 --> 01:45:13,660
they're like, yes. Hell yes.
I want to compete. Uh, guys,

2031
01:45:13,690 --> 01:45:18,690
you can find the blog post for
this episode@fourhourworkweek.com,

2032
01:45:19,571 --> 01:45:21,490
forward slash podcast all spelled out.

2033
01:45:21,880 --> 01:45:26,680
And in the comments you have to leave
your results and you have to leave your

2034
01:45:26,681 --> 01:45:28,250
results.
Uh,

2035
01:45:29,290 --> 01:45:33,280
just to make it easier for
everyone on my side to manage,

2036
01:45:33,310 --> 01:45:37,660
you're going to have to put Hashtag
Noah at the top of your comment.

2037
01:45:37,690 --> 01:45:39,640
And if you can't follow
that set of instructions,

2038
01:45:39,641 --> 01:45:41,500
we're not going to look at your comments.
So do that.

2039
01:45:41,740 --> 01:45:45,580
Hashtag Noah at the top of the comment
and a what should they include in their

2040
01:45:45,581 --> 01:45:46,414
comment?
Noah?

2041
01:45:46,730 --> 01:45:49,150
Yes. So two things.
There's going to be there.

2042
01:45:49,151 --> 01:45:51,950
There's definitely people on your
audience. Your audience is awesome.

2043
01:45:52,010 --> 01:45:54,200
Like I've met a lot of people that,
and they're all over the world. I'm,

2044
01:45:54,201 --> 01:45:56,070
they're like, yeah, I love Tim and,
and how my life has changed it.

2045
01:45:56,080 --> 01:45:58,760
So I know that there's already people who
are kicking ass and running successful

2046
01:45:58,761 --> 01:46:01,880
businesses. You're like, well Noah,
I already have a successful business.

2047
01:46:01,881 --> 01:46:05,210
I'm in Australia. It was a great
Australian and is that pretty good?

2048
01:46:05,211 --> 01:46:08,710
That was going to Australian like
kangaroo, British accent. Um,

2049
01:46:09,320 --> 01:46:12,070
so I'm looking more for the
people who are taking actions.

2050
01:46:12,071 --> 01:46:15,710
So if you already have them
was take action on really
significantly growing that

2051
01:46:15,711 --> 01:46:16,610
on the seven days.

2052
01:46:17,090 --> 01:46:19,970
I'm looking for people who have the
biggest results either from zero to a

2053
01:46:19,971 --> 01:46:22,520
hundred or from a thousand to 100,000.

2054
01:46:22,910 --> 01:46:25,940
And so what I really want to see is
what have you done to really grow your

2055
01:46:25,941 --> 01:46:28,910
mailing list in the next seven days
from when you've listened to this?

2056
01:46:29,330 --> 01:46:31,130
And for the people, just
to remind you, if you,

2057
01:46:31,340 --> 01:46:34,910
if you don't have a mentalist or if you
don't have a business or if you have a

2058
01:46:34,911 --> 01:46:35,121
business,

2059
01:46:35,121 --> 01:46:37,970
this is the best way to communicate
with your customers whenever you want to

2060
01:46:37,971 --> 01:46:38,571
sell them something.

2061
01:46:38,571 --> 01:46:40,490
Or even if you just want to share
your message with the world,

2062
01:46:40,730 --> 01:46:44,690
you have direct access to something that,
how often do you check your email?

2063
01:46:44,780 --> 01:46:47,990
I know how often I check
mine. Uh, it's, it's a lot,

2064
01:46:47,991 --> 01:46:50,900
especially coming on the toilet, you
know, like oh email, it's toilet time. Uh,

2065
01:46:51,100 --> 01:46:54,000
that an Instagram. The second thing
that I wanted to mention to him.

2066
01:46:54,001 --> 01:46:55,140

2078
01:47:29,500 --> 01:47:32,620
Very cool, and I will put this in

2079
01:47:33,280 --> 01:47:36,490

and all sorts of other things that we

2080
01:47:36,491 --> 01:47:39,940
talked about in this episode.
But, uh, just to recap,

2081
01:47:39,970 --> 01:47:42,370
so in the comment,
if you're going to do this,

2082
01:47:42,700 --> 01:47:45,880
Hashtag Noah your
results and what you did,

2083
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:48,580
quantify it whenever possible,

2084
01:47:48,820 --> 01:47:52,930
and then I want you to end with the most
important lesson that you learned in

2085
01:47:52,931 --> 01:47:55,150
doing this exercise.
Um,

2086
01:47:55,151 --> 01:47:59,530
so that the comments themselves
because become very useful resource for

2087
01:47:59,531 --> 01:48:02,310
everybody. Um, good stuff.

2088
01:48:02,320 --> 01:48:04,990
And I'm just want to see people take
action and they do and then get results

2089
01:48:04,991 --> 01:48:07,690
because you can do it from your
phone. There's no excuse. Yeah, no,

2090
01:48:07,691 --> 01:48:12,080
there's no excuse. Uh, so let's, let's
do this. No, I am a, I actually, you're,

2091
01:48:12,081 --> 01:48:16,270
you're making me think of all the things
I want to do now and I know you're

2092
01:48:16,271 --> 01:48:19,510
running a company, but we have to,
we're going to go do a flotation.

2093
01:48:19,540 --> 01:48:22,570
I'm taking my girlfriend first surprise
flotation evidence, a flotation tank.

2094
01:48:23,110 --> 01:48:24,910
I have done flotation tank.
Actually.

2095
01:48:24,911 --> 01:48:29,900
I was introduced or finally
pushed to try it by Joe Rogan. Uh,

2096
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:34,250
and you're talking about like a
deprivation tank basically. Exactly, Yep.

2097
01:48:34,330 --> 01:48:38,590
Have you done it before? I have done it
before. Um, actually is our first date,

2098
01:48:38,591 --> 01:48:41,350
which I don't recommend, but I've done
it many times. First date is a very,

2099
01:48:41,351 --> 01:48:44,770
that's an intensive kind of creepy silence
of the lambs first getting in a box

2100
01:48:44,771 --> 01:48:46,990
naked in someone's house.
It's not the idea.

2101
01:48:47,560 --> 01:48:51,760
You have flotation tank at your house.
No, no. I went in Austin a few years ago.

2102
01:48:51,761 --> 01:48:53,550
There was not a, there wasn't,
there wasn't public ones.

2103
01:48:53,551 --> 01:48:56,920
So that a private one in some
ways, his house. So I was like,

2104
01:48:56,921 --> 01:48:59,890
I swear this is legit.
I'm not just trying to get you naked.

2105
01:48:59,920 --> 01:49:02,470
I just need to get into Xbox naked
and I'm gonna close the door on you

2106
01:49:05,010 --> 01:49:06,130
and I'll tell you on that experience,

2107
01:49:06,131 --> 01:49:08,590
I was actually really scared because
it was my first time so I had a panic

2108
01:49:08,591 --> 01:49:10,480
attack. Wow, that's, yes, no good.

2109
01:49:10,770 --> 01:49:13,630
But subsequently I've gone to like
larger ones that are like super clean and

2110
01:49:13,631 --> 01:49:15,880
legit. And I do it like
once a month. My, I,

2111
01:49:15,881 --> 01:49:19,690
I generally bounce between that and
Chinese massages like the reflexology,

2112
01:49:19,691 --> 01:49:21,790
cause they're only 35 bucks
and it's like the secret.

2113
01:49:21,820 --> 01:49:23,200
What's the secret white people don't know.

2114
01:49:23,260 --> 01:49:24,650
So I don't want all you
guys going to do this now,

2115
01:49:24,670 --> 01:49:27,760
but reflexology massages or
35 bucks or Chinese massage,

2116
01:49:27,761 --> 01:49:30,070
there's no happy endings and
it's the most affordable,

2117
01:49:30,071 --> 01:49:33,070
effective massage I've ever
found. Yeah. I need to,

2118
01:49:33,071 --> 01:49:35,170
I need to get all my reflexology action.

2119
01:49:35,171 --> 01:49:37,660
I use something called
a rad roller are Rad.

2120
01:49:37,661 --> 01:49:41,810
It's like two lacrosse balls
melted together to roll out
my feet each day. Uh Oh.

2121
01:49:42,470 --> 01:49:46,720
So these kind of like just nugget sized
recommendations I think are really fun.

2122
01:49:46,721 --> 01:49:48,040
So let,
if you wouldn't mind

2123
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:51,700
just in a sort of wrap up, I'll ask
you a couple of rapid fire questions.

2124
01:49:51,701 --> 01:49:55,450
You don't have to answer
super, super, uh, concisely,

2125
01:49:55,451 --> 01:49:57,510
but just to the extent possible,
we'll,

2126
01:49:57,511 --> 01:50:01,390
we'll try to do short questions and short
answers and we'll do a couple of, hey,

2127
01:50:01,391 --> 01:50:05,290
could you speak shortly? Not Long, just do
it. I'm like, yes, I'll do it. Less words.

2128
01:50:05,930 --> 01:50:09,180
I use my ESL skills.
Uh,

2129
01:50:09,250 --> 01:50:11,260
when you think of the word successful,

2130
01:50:11,261 --> 01:50:14,920
who's the first person who comes
to mind and why? Evan Williams.

2131
01:50:15,550 --> 01:50:19,150
So for those people that he
is the co founder of Twitter,

2132
01:50:19,450 --> 01:50:24,040
blogger medium, uh, all,
all around baller, why,

2133
01:50:24,100 --> 01:50:26,610
why is that? So, you know,

2134
01:50:27,250 --> 01:50:30,730
I think it's easy to do a
business once and be successful.

2135
01:50:30,760 --> 01:50:35,250
I think when you can do it multiple times,
you're a bad ass. Um, and I don't know,

2136
01:50:35,320 --> 01:50:37,150
success is very relative
to how you define it,

2137
01:50:37,151 --> 01:50:41,090
but if it's money or if it's
whatever it is you want it to be. Um,

2138
01:50:41,260 --> 01:50:43,900
I think from like a business
creation and making society better,

2139
01:50:43,901 --> 01:50:46,630
Evan is very interesting
communication and he didn't, you know,

2140
01:50:46,660 --> 01:50:49,660
it's pretty big that you did blogger. I
think most people do blogger and tap out.

2141
01:50:50,230 --> 01:50:53,050
You're like, you know, I'm, I'm pretty,
it's like you on Musk. He did one thing,

2142
01:50:53,080 --> 01:50:53,321
you know,

2143
01:50:53,321 --> 01:50:56,380
he's already sold the company and then he
did paypal and then he did another one.

2144
01:50:56,381 --> 01:51:00,130
It's like him and everyone's just like,
holy Moly, you don't just do it once.

2145
01:51:00,131 --> 01:51:04,170
You do it many times. Um, because easy
to hit a home run once, but to do,

2146
01:51:04,171 --> 01:51:07,690
do it consistently. Just I think the
consistency of it and dedication is,

2147
01:51:07,691 --> 01:51:10,250
was really impressive to
me about that. No, I agree.

2148
01:51:10,251 --> 01:51:14,980
And what's also impressive and really
inspiring about that is generally

2149
01:51:14,981 --> 01:51:15,461
speaking,

2150
01:51:15,461 --> 01:51:19,060
the guys who have that type of
consistency or gals and do it repeatedly,

2151
01:51:19,540 --> 01:51:24,220
are doing it for reasons other than the
money because they already have more

2152
01:51:24,221 --> 01:51:27,700
money than God and some of these cases.
And it's really about the mission.

2153
01:51:27,701 --> 01:51:30,370
And I think that's partially why
some of them like Ev, you know,

2154
01:51:30,371 --> 01:51:34,000
I've spent time with as, and he's,
uh, he comes across as a happy guy.

2155
01:51:34,030 --> 01:51:37,900
You know what I mean? It's a, and
that's not what does surprise you.

2156
01:51:38,020 --> 01:51:40,880
It's incredibly surprising because the,
the,

2157
01:51:40,910 --> 01:51:45,910
the type a personalities that I usually
run into who have made hundreds of

2158
01:51:45,940 --> 01:51:48,640
millions or billions of dollars are
so driven that they have trouble

2159
01:51:48,641 --> 01:51:50,050
appreciating anything that they have.

2160
01:51:50,110 --> 01:51:53,020
And I don't feel like
that's the case with f. Um,

2161
01:51:53,170 --> 01:51:58,170
so all the more impressive to me that
he's able to maintain that type of

2162
01:51:58,601 --> 01:52:03,550
perspective. Uh, okay. Do you have
any favorite movies or documentaries?

2163
01:52:04,620 --> 01:52:07,990
Uh, yes. So my fair movie
immediately is commando.

2164
01:52:08,050 --> 01:52:12,460
It's a horrible Arnold
Schwarzenegger movie. So easing,
oh my God, it's, it's great.

2165
01:52:12,461 --> 01:52:15,040
I just, I don't know. I was a kid. I
watched it over and over on Beta tapes,

2166
01:52:15,041 --> 01:52:18,760
which you younguns probably don't
know about. Um, I love con, uh,

2167
01:52:18,850 --> 01:52:21,460
two other ones I think are just really
well done. It's count of Monte Cristo.

2168
01:52:21,750 --> 01:52:24,940
I haven't seen that. Oh,
it's just such good revenge.

2169
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,280
If you just want to get revenge, like
you have an ex girlfriend or something,

2170
01:52:27,281 --> 01:52:29,890
you watch this guy and like
I need to be like him. Um,

2171
01:52:30,820 --> 01:52:34,300
and then there's a recent documentary
called the jinx. Oh, I haven't seen that.

2172
01:52:34,600 --> 01:52:36,780
Oh Dude, you're going to
blow your mind. What is,

2173
01:52:37,040 --> 01:52:39,400
which one I don't think everyone wants
you to do and no one wants you to do.

2174
01:52:39,401 --> 01:52:43,480
But this guy blows people's minds
with his gun and he gets away with it.

2175
01:52:44,110 --> 01:52:48,030
Huh? It's a, it's a documentary on
Robert Frost, which you probably,

2176
01:52:48,031 --> 01:52:50,780
you've heard his name or seen his
name somewhere, but they just like,

2177
01:52:50,810 --> 01:52:54,420
they get you and the ending is
just insane. Don't, all right.

2178
01:52:54,530 --> 01:52:58,400
If you ever watch the jinx, go watch
the jinx and thank me later. Awesome.

2179
01:52:58,401 --> 01:53:00,320
I'll throw out another one for
people who like documentaries,

2180
01:53:00,321 --> 01:53:01,820
King of King of Kong,

2181
01:53:03,010 --> 01:53:05,960
uh, or man on wire. You can
look at those two and then,

2182
01:53:06,020 --> 01:53:09,160
and then choose one to suit your tastes.
Uh,

2183
01:53:09,670 --> 01:53:14,010
what advice would you give
to how old are, you know, no,

2184
01:53:14,230 --> 01:53:18,620
33, dude, I'm like dead in
the Internet zone. I'm like,
I'm old. I'm dinosaur. Yeah,

2185
01:53:18,630 --> 01:53:23,290
you are a dinosaur. What advice would
you give to your 25 year old self?

2186
01:53:25,100 --> 01:53:27,020
Uh,
and I say my first five

2187
01:53:27,280 --> 01:53:29,530
I've been asking, I've been telling
people 20 but we're fucking,

2188
01:53:29,560 --> 01:53:31,380
everybody's a fucking
idiot. It's 20. Yeah,

2189
01:53:32,340 --> 01:53:37,140
I was going to say condoms morning
after pill condoms now. Um, you know,

2190
01:53:37,150 --> 01:53:39,280
I'd say that the number one thing that I,
and here's the thing,

2191
01:53:39,281 --> 01:53:41,890
I think a lot of these things people
can hear and then they just discard.

2192
01:53:42,070 --> 01:53:44,640
So let me just tell you how to do it.
So get a mentor, but you're like, oh,

2193
01:53:44,641 --> 01:53:47,440
I don't know how to get a mentor.
Here's what you should do.

2194
01:53:47,710 --> 01:53:51,160
Email the person that you respect the
most that's done the thing you want to do

2195
01:53:51,370 --> 01:53:52,590
that you know right now.
Like get up,

2196
01:53:52,630 --> 01:53:55,510
have your phone and text them
and email and be like, hey,

2197
01:53:55,511 --> 01:53:57,460
I think you're the really best
person I know in the space.

2198
01:53:57,610 --> 01:53:59,260
Like can I meet with
you on a regular basis?

2199
01:53:59,890 --> 01:54:02,050
And if they are like a person
who's too busy for you,

2200
01:54:02,200 --> 01:54:03,430
ask them who they'd recommend.
Like,

2201
01:54:03,431 --> 01:54:06,940
who do you learn from locally or Internet
lead or wherever that I could just

2202
01:54:06,941 --> 01:54:07,870
talk to on a regular basis.

2203
01:54:07,870 --> 01:54:10,690
And I really wish I would have
been more active in securing that.

2204
01:54:10,870 --> 01:54:13,750
And you don't have to go try to get Peter
Teal or Tim Ferriss or no king cause

2205
01:54:13,751 --> 01:54:16,420
we don't want to help you.
It's like we want to have like we don't,

2206
01:54:16,480 --> 01:54:20,860
we're busy doing things that we want to
help at scale. It's hard. Exactly. Okay.

2207
01:54:20,861 --> 01:54:23,800
Thank you. To see that's where we
have Tim, I'll use the ugly word,

2208
01:54:24,030 --> 01:54:26,200
ugly ass word in that capacity.
But,

2209
01:54:26,340 --> 01:54:29,050
and so it's not that I
don't want to help people,

2210
01:54:29,350 --> 01:54:32,020
it's just like I don't have the capacity
to help as many people as I'd like.

2211
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:33,880
And so when I was 25,

2212
01:54:33,881 --> 01:54:36,610
I think I would have spent more time
finding someone that's done the things I

2213
01:54:36,611 --> 01:54:40,810
want and helping them and having active,
uh, meetings with them to be like, Hey,

2214
01:54:40,811 --> 01:54:41,920
you've already done where I want to go.

2215
01:54:41,920 --> 01:54:44,230
Why don't I just learn it from you instead
of wasting all the time that I had to

2216
01:54:44,231 --> 01:54:47,740
do. Um, number two, at 25 hours
a week I'd worked for free.

2217
01:54:47,770 --> 01:54:50,350
So I would go help that person.
So email your friend, be like, Yo,

2218
01:54:50,620 --> 01:54:52,960
can I meet with you? I'll help you with
whatever you want. And if they don't,

2219
01:54:53,020 --> 01:54:55,930
if they're not busy, ask who they'd
recommend. Uh, and then third,

2220
01:54:55,960 --> 01:55:00,610
I really just kind of look at your phone
or your Internet browsing or in your

2221
01:55:00,611 --> 01:55:05,320
home and look at the products or services
that I was using at today right now

2222
01:55:05,410 --> 01:55:07,990
and go work for those
companies. Hmm. So yeah,

2223
01:55:08,080 --> 01:55:11,050
when I was 25 and I did do this and I'm
really happy to this, but I was like,

2224
01:55:11,051 --> 01:55:12,700
I just like Facebook.
I'm going to go try to work there.

2225
01:55:12,910 --> 01:55:14,680
I just love personal finances.

2226
01:55:14,681 --> 01:55:17,590
I did a personal finance workshop this
morning with my team because I just love

2227
01:55:17,591 --> 01:55:20,320
talking about money. Um, and
so I went and worked at mint.

2228
01:55:20,410 --> 01:55:25,120
So go and try to surround yourself or put
yourself in places doing the work that

2229
01:55:25,121 --> 01:55:27,400
you really want to be doing. Yeah.
And he's just way to do that.

2230
01:55:27,401 --> 01:55:30,100
It's just look at what you're
already enjoying. And then go like,

2231
01:55:30,101 --> 01:55:31,210
think about if you could do that all day.

2232
01:55:32,190 --> 01:55:35,250
Absolutely. And some
other related, uh, bits,

2233
01:55:35,251 --> 01:55:38,730
I just actually heard this
yesterday from someone, uh,

2234
01:55:39,210 --> 01:55:44,010
older gent actually who's,
uh, he's not above asking for

2235
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:46,050
mentorship.
And um,

2236
01:55:46,170 --> 01:55:49,950
I usually discourage people from using
the word mentor or mentorship because

2237
01:55:49,951 --> 01:55:53,820
it's just, it screams unpaid fulltime
job. So if you're going to pitch,

2238
01:55:53,821 --> 01:55:58,050
people don't use that wording, but I
think the work for free piece is huge.

2239
01:55:58,051 --> 01:56:03,051
And when he said he got one of the biggest
names in Silicon Valley to mentor him

2240
01:56:03,721 --> 01:56:04,321
effectively,

2241
01:56:04,321 --> 01:56:07,360
although he didn't call it that because
he said it pretty much the same thing,

2242
01:56:07,361 --> 01:56:10,290
he emailed this guy out
of the blue and said,

2243
01:56:11,070 --> 01:56:15,150
I really respect what you've done with a,
B and, c, I've read everything about it.

2244
01:56:15,600 --> 01:56:17,520
Um,
here are things I've done.

2245
01:56:17,550 --> 01:56:21,390
If you have something that might be
sort of credible, if not, that's fine.

2246
01:56:21,391 --> 01:56:24,270
And then he said, I know
you're working on a book. Uh,

2247
01:56:24,271 --> 01:56:27,510
I would love to ask you some very
specific questions for every hour that you

2248
01:56:27,511 --> 01:56:28,261
spend with me.

2249
01:56:28,261 --> 01:56:32,700
I will spend four hours proofreading your
book or helping you with the book pro

2250
01:56:32,701 --> 01:56:35,100
Bono.
And that's how he got the first meeting.

2251
01:56:35,340 --> 01:56:40,070
And then the guy agreed to meet with
him on an ongoing basis for, uh,

2252
01:56:40,110 --> 01:56:44,010
more than a year and never took him up
on the proofreading offer even though

2253
01:56:44,011 --> 01:56:48,920
that was sort of the sugar that that
made the pill go down. Um, so that,

2254
01:56:48,921 --> 01:56:53,550
that's a really important
point. And Charlie Hoehn has
some good writing on this.

2255
01:56:54,130 --> 01:56:58,920
H O h n on, on working for
free. Really? 100%, uh,

2256
01:56:59,280 --> 01:57:00,930
a book. Oh no, go for it.

2257
01:57:01,380 --> 01:57:02,420
No, no, no. He's a bookworm assessment.

2258
01:57:02,430 --> 01:57:06,380
Proof of proof graduate is just epic for
younger people starting out or anyone

2259
01:57:06,410 --> 01:57:10,020
or anyone who's starting over or
trying to reinvent themselves. Really.

2260
01:57:10,040 --> 01:57:12,280
Other thing too, I think you
said, which is super trade,

2261
01:57:12,290 --> 01:57:14,710
I just want to highlight it for everyone
listening is don't email people.

2262
01:57:14,720 --> 01:57:16,790
Be like, Hey, I'll help you with
anything. Because I'm like, well,

2263
01:57:16,791 --> 01:57:19,280
now I have to think about what to do and
you're going to be a shitty free labor

2264
01:57:19,281 --> 01:57:22,460
person. Yeah. Like that's the worst
because you're getting like 10,

2265
01:57:22,490 --> 01:57:24,920
how many animals do you like roughly
how many miles you get to do like, Hey,

2266
01:57:24,921 --> 01:57:25,551
I want to work with you.

2267
01:57:25,551 --> 01:57:27,830
Can I hang out with you can have coffee
with you from people you don't know?

2268
01:57:28,040 --> 01:57:32,590
Uh, at least a hundred a day.
Uh, the Holy Shit to my team.

2269
01:57:32,620 --> 01:57:36,610
Or B, if they manage to somehow, you know,
spam a hundred emails and get one. Right.

2270
01:57:37,150 --> 01:57:40,960
Exactly. And so, you know,
it's interesting to think
about like, how do you,

2271
01:57:41,050 --> 01:57:43,330
how does the person stand out
to actually get ahold of him?

2272
01:57:43,690 --> 01:57:47,830
And so here's how you do
it. You won, someone told me
this yesterday, I loved it.

2273
01:57:47,860 --> 01:57:50,170
It was called the swipe.
The one thumb rule,

2274
01:57:50,171 --> 01:57:54,760
which is your email should be able to
be one thumbed on the phone. Yeah. Yeah.

2275
01:57:54,761 --> 01:57:55,700
Which I thought was pretty good.

2276
01:57:56,110 --> 01:57:57,910
I thought that was a good way of
looking at the one thumb rule.

2277
01:57:58,060 --> 01:58:01,030
The second thing is don't tell Tim,
you can study Tim all day.

2278
01:58:01,031 --> 01:58:02,080
All of your stuff is public.

2279
01:58:02,081 --> 01:58:04,950
Most of it that you're working on
or thinking about ghosts, study Tim.

2280
01:58:04,960 --> 01:58:07,450
And do the work, then send
it to Tim. There's a guy,

2281
01:58:07,451 --> 01:58:11,680
brian@videofruit.com and Brian does this
for a lot of people. Are He emails you?

2282
01:58:11,681 --> 01:58:14,290
And he's like, Hey, I made this video for
you and to this marketing role for you.

2283
01:58:14,380 --> 01:58:16,600
Hey, I did this document for
you here. I just sent it to you.

2284
01:58:16,720 --> 01:58:19,540
I'm not expecting shit. And then you're
like, well damn, this is really good.

2285
01:58:19,600 --> 01:58:20,433
What else can you do?

2286
01:58:20,930 --> 01:58:21,763
Yup,
Yup.

2287
01:58:22,060 --> 01:58:24,290
Milling Timberlake who tune, we
should just like, can I help you?

2288
01:58:24,291 --> 01:58:26,360
I'll be a free intern just so
they can learn to pick your brain.

2289
01:58:26,790 --> 01:58:31,770
Yeah. And I don't, uh, I don't reply to
any of those and that it, number one,

2290
01:58:31,771 --> 01:58:32,910
because they don't have the capacity.

2291
01:58:32,911 --> 01:58:37,650
And I think for a lot of
tasks like that that are,

2292
01:58:37,651 --> 01:58:40,260
and don't make no mistake,
that's a task that I have to,

2293
01:58:40,261 --> 01:58:42,820
I have to do that instead
of something else. Um,

2294
01:58:44,350 --> 01:58:46,350
piece of advice that I got from someone.
Um,

2295
01:58:46,450 --> 01:58:49,780
but I'm blanking on who said this to me,
but they said, and it was so I was like,

2296
01:58:49,781 --> 01:58:53,780
wow, okay. That is great.
And it, it's, it, it's,

2297
01:58:53,781 --> 01:58:57,490
it sort of comes back to your point
about doing your homework and they said,

2298
01:58:57,491 --> 01:59:01,270
if someone hasn't done their homework
to determine if something is a fit,

2299
01:59:01,540 --> 01:59:05,590
I don't have the time to explain to
them why it isn't a fit. And I was like,

2300
01:59:06,450 --> 01:59:11,080
isn't that good? And I like
that. And I was like, Oh man,

2301
01:59:11,140 --> 01:59:13,900
that is a, that is a gem. And uh,

2302
01:59:13,930 --> 01:59:18,430
so that when I have ended up, uh, doing,

2303
01:59:18,880 --> 01:59:22,960
uh, for instance, ending up working
with Charlie or whatever his number one,

2304
01:59:22,990 --> 01:59:27,640
they did something of value that was
highly specific in indicated they'd done a

2305
01:59:27,641 --> 01:59:29,490
lot of homework.
Uh,

2306
01:59:29,500 --> 01:59:32,920
that was very helpful and they
didn't expect anything in return,

2307
01:59:32,980 --> 01:59:37,000
but they did such good work that I was
like, like you said, I was like, Huh, wow.

2308
01:59:37,150 --> 01:59:41,950
What else can this guy do a, or you know,
maybe maybe someone's like, hey, here's a,

2309
01:59:41,970 --> 01:59:44,950
you know, uh, uh, this is
not an example. Please.

2310
01:59:45,020 --> 01:59:47,050
I don't need a thousand of
these sent to me guys. But like,

2311
01:59:47,051 --> 01:59:49,210
here's a summary of podcast x.

2312
01:59:49,270 --> 01:59:52,840
And I thought this would be useful
for you to use as a pdf, uh,

2313
01:59:52,900 --> 01:59:55,900
as my logo all over it. Yeah.
Well, but if they're like, hey,

2314
01:59:55,901 --> 01:59:57,100
if you want me to do a few more of these,

2315
01:59:57,101 --> 02:00:01,230
like I have some dead time between
now and Blah, um, let me know. But if,

2316
02:00:01,270 --> 02:00:04,130
if I don't hear back from you, no
problem. Right. And I think another Pr,

2317
02:00:04,160 --> 02:00:07,990
another mistake a lot of
people make is they buy, and I,

2318
02:00:07,991 --> 02:00:09,940
and I've been guilty of this in the past,
you know,

2319
02:00:09,941 --> 02:00:12,830
and I look back at some of my behavior
when I was just getting started and I

2320
02:00:13,080 --> 02:00:16,150
cringe because it was in retrospect,
I'm like, no, fucking wonder.

2321
02:00:16,151 --> 02:00:18,340
I didn't get any responses. Uh, if,

2322
02:00:18,550 --> 02:00:22,810
if you send emails like any of what
we've described today and you don't get a

2323
02:00:22,811 --> 02:00:26,530
response, don't take it personally.
And that's easy advice to say.

2324
02:00:26,531 --> 02:00:28,390
But I would take it one step further.

2325
02:00:28,780 --> 02:00:32,500
And the way you don't take it personally
is assume that the people who don't

2326
02:00:32,501 --> 02:00:36,760
respond to have excellent reasons for
not responding. Right. And I'm like,

2327
02:00:36,820 --> 02:00:38,530
maybe someone in their family is sick.

2328
02:00:38,590 --> 02:00:41,200
Maybe they're trying to take care of
their kids. I'm in trouble at school,

2329
02:00:41,230 --> 02:00:44,860
maybe fill in the blank. Just assume they
have a good reason for not responding.

2330
02:00:45,310 --> 02:00:49,540
And um, there's another expression, God,
I wish I could remember who told me this,

2331
02:00:49,810 --> 02:00:53,010
but you know, don't attribute
to malice that would, that,

2332
02:00:53,070 --> 02:00:56,350
that which can be
explained by incompetence.

2333
02:00:56,351 --> 02:00:58,840
But I would modify that
and I would say don't,

2334
02:00:58,870 --> 02:01:02,710
don't attribute to malice what can be
explained by incompetence and competence

2335
02:01:03,040 --> 02:01:05,260
or just buisiness.
Right?

2336
02:01:05,290 --> 02:01:07,840
So just because someone doesn't get
back to you right away or just because

2337
02:01:07,841 --> 02:01:11,500
someone sends you a short
email and misses something, uh,

2338
02:01:11,560 --> 02:01:14,800
don't immediately assume that it's
because they're trying to fuck with you or

2339
02:01:14,801 --> 02:01:16,150
because they don't respect you.

2340
02:01:16,270 --> 02:01:19,300
I see so many people get wound up and
they're like, oh my God, so disrespectful.

2341
02:01:19,301 --> 02:01:20,170
I'm like, oh, so blah.

2342
02:01:20,530 --> 02:01:23,050
And they shoot themselves in the foot
and I've been guilty of that myself.

2343
02:01:23,080 --> 02:01:25,540
I think that I'm pretty quick
to anger and very impatient.

2344
02:01:25,541 --> 02:01:30,330
So it's taken a lot of effort to try
to sand down the rough edges. But, uh,

2345
02:01:31,180 --> 02:01:36,040
another lap, just one last tip,
uh, is, uh, for finding mentors.

2346
02:01:36,041 --> 02:01:40,040
A great way to do that is to volunteer
for local business organizations that host

2347
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:42,620
events. That's what I did when
I moved to Silicon Valley.

2348
02:01:42,621 --> 02:01:47,270
So you can volunteer at events where
they have local icons or business leaders

2349
02:01:47,271 --> 02:01:51,290
coming to speak, and you get to
interact with those people. And if,

2350
02:01:51,310 --> 02:01:53,030
if you're volunteering somewhere,
by the way,

2351
02:01:53,031 --> 02:01:54,950
it does not give you
license to do a shitty job.

2352
02:01:55,220 --> 02:01:57,050
And most people think that's true.

2353
02:01:57,260 --> 02:02:01,730
So you can stand out just by doing twice
what you're asked to do as a volunteer.

2354
02:02:01,731 --> 02:02:04,010
And that's how you get to know people.
Like I did,

2355
02:02:04,011 --> 02:02:06,740
I got to know Jack Canfield to
cocreate a chicken soup for the soul.

2356
02:02:07,040 --> 02:02:10,670
And then many years later introduced me
to the guy who became my agent who sold

2357
02:02:10,671 --> 02:02:15,290
the four hour workweek. Uh, that was
pretty cool. Yeah. All right. So to know,

2358
02:02:15,350 --> 02:02:16,330
next question,
uh,

2359
02:02:16,400 --> 02:02:21,400
what is the purchase that you've made
in the last say six months for $100 or

2360
02:02:22,221 --> 02:02:22,521
less,

2361
02:02:22,521 --> 02:02:26,840
that has had the greatest impact on your
life purchase in the last six months?

2362
02:02:26,860 --> 02:02:27,693
The episode?

2363
02:02:27,800 --> 02:02:31,550
I would say one, I purchased it around
that time, but it's my nutribullet.

2364
02:02:32,530 --> 02:02:35,770
I don't know what that is. It's
the magic bullets, bigger brother.

2365
02:02:35,860 --> 02:02:38,270
The magic bullet, which is not
a sexual device. It's a blend.

2366
02:02:40,060 --> 02:02:44,920
I guess it could be in some weird ways,
but the nutri bullet is basically like,

2367
02:02:45,430 --> 02:02:49,630
I like smoothies, I like my protein
shakes, I like blending up things. Um,

2368
02:02:49,660 --> 02:02:53,260
but it's always a pain in
the ass to clean. Right? And
this you could just blend,

2369
02:02:53,261 --> 02:02:55,630
drink out and wash out
and there's no cleaning.

2370
02:02:55,900 --> 02:02:58,490
And every time I get this is like the
gift I give to most people. I'm like, do,

2371
02:02:58,530 --> 02:03:00,640
if you don't have any to triple that in
your kitchen, like you're missing out.

2372
02:03:01,190 --> 02:03:03,640
And it's just really effective for like
blending anything and getting it up.

2373
02:03:03,641 --> 02:03:05,890
Like I have a Vitamix,
which is like a $500 blender.

2374
02:03:06,230 --> 02:03:09,510
And I just don't even use it anymore. It's
a lot of cleanup for that thing. Yeah.

2375
02:03:09,520 --> 02:03:09,941
Well yeah,

2376
02:03:09,941 --> 02:03:12,830
it's like I have to get a cleaning lady
to assist me to clean up thing. Uh,

2377
02:03:12,910 --> 02:03:15,790
and the neutral that you can do,
you know, in 20 seconds or less.

2378
02:03:15,791 --> 02:03:18,130
And it's just been a really effective
and it's one of those things that like if

2379
02:03:18,131 --> 02:03:20,380
you don't have it, I just
buy it for people because
that's what I know they need.

2380
02:03:20,930 --> 02:03:22,580
Very cool.
Well action packed.

2381
02:03:23,270 --> 02:03:27,800
I love how many things we were
able to cover and uh, yeah,

2382
02:03:27,801 --> 02:03:31,400
I would love to hear what people think
and also the competition people can check

2383
02:03:31,401 --> 02:03:35,810
out. So go to four hour
work week.com forward slash
podcast to check that out. Uh,

2384
02:03:35,990 --> 02:03:40,990
one more thing I'm going to mention for
folks is that you and I both were on an

2385
02:03:41,001 --> 02:03:45,050
episode of the Tim Ferriss experiment
and coached someone through launching

2386
02:03:45,051 --> 02:03:47,510
their business and went through a lot of,

2387
02:03:47,760 --> 02:03:50,540
of information that we weren't able
to couple cover in this episode,

2388
02:03:50,541 --> 02:03:54,830
like creating call scripts and tons of
challenges like the coffee challenge and

2389
02:03:54,831 --> 02:03:56,990
so on. So that's, I think
people would enjoy checking out,

2390
02:03:57,020 --> 02:04:01,430
but where can people learn more about,
you know, uh, find you online, et cetera.

2391
02:04:02,030 --> 02:04:05,070
Yup. A number one thing for my
personal stuff is going to be an, okay,

2392
02:04:05,100 --> 02:04:09,860
dork.com okay. Dr K. Dot.
Com and business related.

2393
02:04:09,870 --> 02:04:11,070
If you know,
for the tools and every,

2394
02:04:11,080 --> 02:04:14,520
a lot of the main things I was talking
about, it's going to be@sumome.com.

2395
02:04:14,580 --> 02:04:17,130
That's a lot of the businesses that we've
been building in recommending for most

2396
02:04:17,131 --> 02:04:17,964
people.

2397
02:04:18,210 --> 02:04:20,070
Awesome. Uh, anything,

2398
02:04:20,071 --> 02:04:23,400
any parting advice or thoughts
that you'd like to give to folks?

2399
02:04:24,080 --> 02:04:26,410
I would, I would two other
things, cause I looked at I,

2400
02:04:26,470 --> 02:04:28,980
and this is kind of a thing,
like I think there's a,

2401
02:04:28,990 --> 02:04:32,300
there's a ratio of how much you invest
in something to how much you get out.

2402
02:04:32,630 --> 02:04:36,200
So if you're sending emails to people
like Tim or a customer or anybody you want

2403
02:04:36,380 --> 02:04:37,440
and you're sending a quick email,

2404
02:04:37,560 --> 02:04:39,510
you're probably not getting a response
because you're not investing that much.

2405
02:04:39,511 --> 02:04:43,410
So I invested in researching shows and
comments to see what is gonna make this

2406
02:04:43,411 --> 02:04:45,120
the most popular episode ever.

2407
02:04:45,270 --> 02:04:47,100
And that's what I wanted to
be with a number of comments.

2408
02:04:47,101 --> 02:04:50,380
So make sure you go comment. Uh, even
if you don't do the challenge. Well,

2409
02:04:50,580 --> 02:04:54,030
two other things that a lot of people
were asking about. Um, you know,

2410
02:04:54,031 --> 02:04:55,200
we didn't morning ritual,

2411
02:04:55,800 --> 02:04:57,780
but you guys asked me what do
I listen to while working out?

2412
02:04:58,140 --> 02:05:01,650
And I want to share some of my favorite
rap artists. Yeah, yeah, let's do it.

2413
02:05:01,651 --> 02:05:03,960
Your audience. So if they want to
get, they want to get pumped up.

2414
02:05:05,250 --> 02:05:09,090
I listened to a lot of like hardcore rap
and I get mixed tapes from datpiff.com.

2415
02:05:09,840 --> 02:05:14,590
How do you spell that? Dat
I f F. Dot Com. Hmm. Uh,

2416
02:05:14,600 --> 02:05:15,990
so I can't,
I'll shit send it off soon.

2417
02:05:16,020 --> 02:05:19,030
I'll send you my Spotify
playlist too for my workouts. Um,

2418
02:05:19,080 --> 02:05:20,650
but the guys I listened to a lot lately,

2419
02:05:20,700 --> 02:05:23,700
or like Travis Scott
and Wally's new album,

2420
02:05:23,760 --> 02:05:25,800
those two have been going really strong.

2421
02:05:25,830 --> 02:05:28,620
So if you're going to go work out and
go check out a Travis Scott and Wallay,

2422
02:05:28,830 --> 02:05:33,580
how do you spell Wallay?
A w. A. L. E. Y. La.

2423
02:05:34,420 --> 02:05:34,890
[inaudible].

2424
02:05:34,890 --> 02:05:37,680
Do you have any music you listened to
that you're embarrassed to admit you

2425
02:05:37,681 --> 02:05:38,514
listen to?

2426
02:05:39,320 --> 02:05:42,380
Mostly Emo, which is just
going to be like promise ring.

2427
02:05:43,070 --> 02:05:45,620
It's like kind of crying
and crying and stuff.

2428
02:05:47,970 --> 02:05:52,640
It's like, oh, I'm a little
bitch. I'm a little bitch.
Um, the, so that's number one.

2429
02:05:52,641 --> 02:05:55,160
I listened to a promise ring.
Um, a lot of their stuff is good.

2430
02:05:55,460 --> 02:05:56,330
The other thing Tim,
would,

2431
02:05:56,360 --> 02:05:59,560
you guys talked about alcohol and people
seem to like alcohol recommendations.

2432
02:05:59,561 --> 02:06:01,790
So, uh, if you're a Tequila Fan,

2433
02:06:01,820 --> 02:06:05,390
Casa Amigos is affordable and delicious.
Hmm.

2434
02:06:05,710 --> 02:06:08,830
And it's a George Clooney's Tequila and
it's phenomenal. I drink the Rep Rosado.

2435
02:06:09,140 --> 02:06:12,440
Uh, if you're a little more expensive,
which is the best for the price,

2436
02:06:12,441 --> 02:06:15,710
it's called Klossy has Zul and
that's $100 a bottle or 89,

2437
02:06:15,711 --> 02:06:18,920
and it's a porcelain white bottle. And
it's insane. If you'd like to, Kayla,

2438
02:06:19,370 --> 02:06:22,590
is that what you order when you
walk into a bar? You would just, uh,

2439
02:06:22,860 --> 02:06:25,760
it's normally $20 a shot,
so it depends on my mood.

2440
02:06:26,690 --> 02:06:29,720
I'm like $20 a shot. I have the
bottle at home. I could wait.

2441
02:06:29,721 --> 02:06:32,790
I'll just get a soda water.
Uh,

2442
02:06:33,940 --> 02:06:36,920
and or if a, if you're a whiskey
fan about coneys single malt,

2443
02:06:36,980 --> 02:06:37,813
anything by balconies,

2444
02:06:37,850 --> 02:06:41,300
it's a number one whiskey in the
world and it's a Texas whiskey.

2445
02:06:42,020 --> 02:06:46,860
Bocconi is B. A? L? C. O. N.
Yes. Yes sir. Awesome. All right,

2446
02:06:47,180 --> 02:06:51,170
well we will have some Tequila and Tacos
in Austin said, God, that sounds awesome.

2447

this episode is brought to you by
Athletic Greens. I get asked all the time,

2452
02:07:08,091 --> 02:07:10,280
if you could only use one supplement,
what would it be?

2453
02:07:10,580 --> 02:07:13,190
And my answer is
inevitably Athletic Greens,

2454
02:07:13,191 --> 02:07:15,680
it is your all in one
nutritional insurance.

2455
02:07:15,710 --> 02:07:18,590
I recommended it in the four hour
body did not get paid for that.

2456
02:07:18,920 --> 02:07:21,440
And I travel with it
to avoid getting sick.

2457
02:07:21,650 --> 02:07:24,470
I take it in the mornings to
ensure optimal performance.

2458
02:07:24,680 --> 02:07:25,940
It just covers all my bases.

2459
02:07:25,970 --> 02:07:29,960
If I can't get what I need through whole
food meals throughout the rest of the

2460
02:07:29,960 --> 02:07:34,790
day, and you can get 50 oh my
gosh, 50% off. Yes, 50% off.

designs your one stop shop for
all things graphic design related.

2468
02:08:03,490 --> 02:08:08,470
I've used 99 designs for everything
from banner ads to book covers,

2469
02:08:08,471 --> 02:08:12,160
including sketches and mock ups
that led to the four hour body,

2470

which later became number one New York
Times Number One Wall Street Journal and

2471
02:08:16,180 --> 02:08:16,991
the brainstorming.

2472
02:08:16,991 --> 02:08:20,320
A lot of it took place with designers
from around the world and here's how it

2474
02:08:24,790 --> 02:08:27,100
an APP thumbnail,
whatever it might be,

2475
02:08:27,280 --> 02:08:30,850
you submit that project and
designers from around the world.

2476
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:33,490
We'll send you sketches
and mock ups and designs.

2477
02:08:33,670 --> 02:08:37,150
You choose your favorite and you have an
original that you love or you get your

2478
02:08:37,151 --> 02:08:38,860
money back.
It's that straightforward,

2479
02:08:39,190 --> 02:08:42,580
and many of you who are listening have
already used it and created some amazing

2480
02:08:42,581 --> 02:08:44,950
things that I'll be sharing it in
the future. But in the meantime,

2481
02:08:44,951 --> 02:08:47,980

competitions, some of the book covers,
