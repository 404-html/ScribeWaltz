1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,820
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:06,990
I can run flat out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking. No else.

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:07,890
You posted a question.

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,430
I'm a cybernetic organism living tissue.

5
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,170
This episode is brought to you by audible,

6
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:29,230
which has the largest selection
of audio books on the planet.

7
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:33,070
I've used audible for many years and I've
several audio books to recommend right

8
00:00:33,071 --> 00:00:36,790
off the bat. If you're looking for a new
one ready player, one by Ernest Cline,

9
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:39,520
you may have heard of it.
The Tao of Seneca by Seneca.

10
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:43,450
If you want to hear my favorite collection
of letters of all time as well as the

11
00:00:43,451 --> 00:00:45,220
graveyard book by Neil Gaiman,

12
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:50,250
which is a fiction book I
use to reintroduce nonfiction
purists to the beauty

13
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:55,090
and truth and enjoyment,
affection, the graveyard book.

14
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,390
It is incredible and I like the
version that Neil reads himself,

15
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:01,660
but the entire ensemble cast is also fun.

16
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:06,280
Audible members get a credit every month,
good for any audio book in the store,

17
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:09,490
regardless of price and unused
credits roll over to the next month.

18
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:12,700
So if you didn't like your audio
book, no problem. You can exchange it,

19
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:16,810
no questions asked. Plus your books
are yours to keep with audible.

20
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:18,750
You can go back and relisten anytime,

21
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:22,690
even if you cancel your membership
and for some books, again,

22
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,540
graveyard book by Neil Gaiman,
I've listened to many, many times.

23
00:01:25,541 --> 00:01:28,180
She may even just start over as soon
as you finish it the first time.

24
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,930
Audible also helps you to listen to more
books by letting you switch seamlessly

25
00:01:31,931 --> 00:01:34,660
between devices.
Picking up exactly where you left off,

26
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:35,950
whether it's on your phone,

27
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:39,820
through your car from a tablet or
at home on an Amazon Echo, whatever.

28
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:43,900
You can get through tons of books, hands
and free while doing almost anything.

29
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:46,120
So that is part of the beauty of audio.

30
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:49,120
It is a secondary activity when
you're walking the dog cooking,

31
00:01:49,121 --> 00:01:49,954
whatever it might be.

32
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,320
Audible content includes an
unmatched selection of audiobooks,

33

36
00:02:03,101 --> 00:02:03,791
Maybe that's what I am,

37
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:08,140

This episode is brought to you by ink.

44
00:02:35,231 --> 00:02:39,130
Tell and I've used them personally ever
since I wrote the four hour workweek.

45
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:43,210
I've been asked over and over again
how I choose to delegate tasks,

46
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:46,210
how I do 80 20 analysis and so on.

47
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:50,350
At the root of many of those decisions
is a simple question. Actually.

48
00:02:50,351 --> 00:02:54,160
Two questions. Number one,
how can I invest money to
improve my quality of life?

49
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,830
I use that in investing as well.
The second,

50
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:02,100
how can I spend a little money or moderate
money to save significant time inc

51
00:03:02,561 --> 00:03:04,210
tell is one of those investments.

52
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:08,290
There are a turnkey solution for all
of your imaginable customer care needs.

53
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:12,490
I used ink tell during the launch of
the four hour body, which was very,

54
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:16,900
very involved and they provided 24
seven customer service for my land rush

55
00:03:16,901 --> 00:03:21,460
campaign because it was critical for
me to take care of every person who

56
00:03:21,461 --> 00:03:23,050
purchased my books and participated.

57
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:27,700
This allowed me to focus on the things
that I am better at, my strengths,

58
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,060
like the marketing plan that
we'd worked on for six months,

59
00:03:31,061 --> 00:03:34,120
implementing that until
trains their experience.

60
00:03:34,121 --> 00:03:38,110
Customer service reps to
know your business and your
products inside and out and

61
00:03:38,111 --> 00:03:40,060
make your customers are raving fans.

62
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:44,170
They answer more than a million customer
service requests every year and they

63
00:03:44,171 --> 00:03:48,970
can do so across all platforms including
email, phone, social media, texts,

64
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,013
even chat,

65
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:54,340
leaving your customers with poor
service or just mediocre service,

66
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:58,120
which by the way,
in a competitive pool is a huge liability.

67
00:03:58,121 --> 00:04:03,121
Long wait times are unanswered messages
carries a massive cost and risk to your

68
00:04:03,551 --> 00:04:04,230
business.

69
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:08,260
Ink Tell removes the logistics and
headaches of this type of communication,

70
00:04:08,261 --> 00:04:12,430
allowing you to focus on your
strengths and grow your business.

71
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:15,100
It can be a real competitive advantage.
And I see many,

72
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:20,101
many ecommerce companies
and tech companies thinking
of customer service as a

73
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:25,291
good enough checkbox or an afterthought
and just like airbnb use design and

74
00:04:26,231 --> 00:04:30,040
innovative ways to be a
competitor and to win that,

75
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,990
you can do the same thing
with customer service.

76
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:37,090

Hello boys and girls.

82
00:04:55,571 --> 00:04:59,230
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another
episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

83
00:04:59,231 --> 00:05:03,310
it is my job to deconstruct world class
performers, to tease out the habits,

84
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:06,340
routines, et Cetera, that
you can use in your life.

And this episode is a four or five

but four or five for the price of one
because my guest is none other than Doris

87
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,620
Kearns Goodwin who can be
found at Doris Kearns Goodwin.

88
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:23,350
That's k e a r n s Doris Kearns,

89
00:05:23,351 --> 00:05:28,351
goodwin.com also on Facebook
and on Twitter at Doris K.

90
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:32,760
Goodwin. Who's Doris? Well, let me
begin with some background doors.

91
00:05:32,761 --> 00:05:36,970
His interest in leadership began more
than a half century ago as a professor at

92
00:05:36,971 --> 00:05:37,804
Harvard.

93
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,710
Her experiences working for Lbj in the
White House and later assisting him on

94
00:05:41,711 --> 00:05:44,920
his memoirs led to Lyndon
Johnson and the American dream.

95
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,880
She followed that up with the Pulitzer
prize winning, no ordinary time,

96
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:52,480
subtitle Franklin and Eleanor and
the home front in World War II.

97
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:57,010
She then earned the Lincoln prize for
the runaway bestseller team of rivals.

98
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:00,020
For those of you who don't
recognize that book title,

99
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:04,490
you might recognize it as the basis for
Steven Spielberg's award winning film,

100
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:08,780
Lincoln, and she then won the
Carnegie metal for the bully pulpit,

101
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:12,170
the chronicle of the Friendship Between
Theater Roosevelt and William Howard

102
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:12,830
Taft.

103
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:17,570
Her newest book is leadership
in turbulent times,

104
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:22,900
and I love this book because it goes all
the way back to the very beginning and

105
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:28,880
looks at how the four presidents
she studied most closely,

106
00:06:28,881 --> 00:06:32,600
Abraham Lincoln Theater,
Roosevelt, Fdr, and Lbj,

107
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,340
how they found their footing goes all
the way back to their first entries into

108
00:06:37,341 --> 00:06:38,174
public life.

109
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:42,050
And we encounter them at a time when
their paths were filled with confusion,

110
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,600
uncertainty, fear, and hope.

111
00:06:44,601 --> 00:06:48,110
How did they establish
themselves as leaders?

112
00:06:48,111 --> 00:06:50,210
What did other people recognize in them?

113
00:06:50,211 --> 00:06:53,630
But also how did they manage
their lives day to day?

114
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,690
How did they get to sleep?
Where there any tricks that they used?

115
00:06:56,691 --> 00:07:01,691
Any social conventions or rituals that
they use to maintain composure in the

116
00:07:02,001 --> 00:07:05,990
hardest of times? We dig into
all of that, and as such,

117
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:11,020
we get all sorts of tidbits and
life lessons from not just Doris,

118
00:07:11,361 --> 00:07:15,200
we do talk about her life as well,
but these presidents,

119
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:19,610
she has studied so in depth.
And with that,

120
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:23,120
I had a blast with this episode
and let's just get right to it.

121
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:24,230
Without further ado,

122
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:29,210
please enjoy this wide ranging
conversation with Doris Kearns Goodwin.

123
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:35,260
Doris, welcome to the show.
Glad to be with you, Tim.

124
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,840
I have been looking forward to this
conversation and also very intimidated by

125
00:07:41,031 --> 00:07:45,070
this conversation in my prep
and in doing all of my homework.

126
00:07:45,071 --> 00:07:48,560
So I'm going to apologize in advanced
to you and my listeners if I embarrass

127
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:53,590
myself with my lack of domain expertise
as we get into many different things.

128
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:59,030
Uh, but I thought we could start with
something that does not intimidate me.

129
00:07:59,031 --> 00:08:04,031
And that is some of your very
early childhood experiences.

130
00:08:04,491 --> 00:08:09,491
I had read in the course
of doing preparation for
this conversation that your

131
00:08:10,641 --> 00:08:15,020
father was an optimist and his optimism
was perhaps the greatest or one of the

132
00:08:15,021 --> 00:08:19,010
greatest gifts that he gave you.
Could you perhaps just set the,

133
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:24,190
set the scene and explain some of the
circumstances and then also what that

134
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:26,960
meant, uh, to, uh, to
instill optimism in you?

135
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:31,150
No, I do indeed feel like it was the
greatest gift he could have given me.

136
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,040
He had a very difficult life,

137
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:35,350
which I learned about of course
when I was a little girl,

138
00:08:35,351 --> 00:08:37,660
but never having met his
parents or grandparents.

139
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:42,130
Grandparents had come over from Ireland
and then my father was orphaned when he

140
00:08:42,131 --> 00:08:43,180
was 10 years old.

141
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,110
His little brother was hit by a
trolley car when my father was 10.

142
00:08:47,111 --> 00:08:49,480
The little boy was six.
His mother was pregnant,

143
00:08:49,481 --> 00:08:53,110
he had a two year old sister
and the little boy died.

144
00:08:53,111 --> 00:08:56,940
Finally from the trolley accident,
his mother had a child, died,

145
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:58,930
another child and um,

146
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:03,980
his sister and he were then put out to
other people after his mother died in

147
00:09:04,981 --> 00:09:08,880
childbirth, his father committed
suicide. We learned this all later.

148
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:12,870
So here's this man, Michael Francis
Aloysius Carnes, 10 years old,

149
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:17,790
goes to work very early, eventually
becomes a bank examiner in New York state,

150
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:21,540
was great with numbers, something
that he did not give me as a gift,

151
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,260
but most importantly he somehow,
if you saw that man,

152
00:09:25,261 --> 00:09:28,050
you would never know that sadness
that he had in his childhood.

153
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:31,290
He had a twinkle in his eye.
He loved life.

154
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:34,830
He gave me that optimistic spirit
telling me if you like people,

155
00:09:34,831 --> 00:09:37,860
people will like you in turn.
And I,

156
00:09:37,861 --> 00:09:40,470
it's been the way my life
has been led since then.

157
00:09:40,471 --> 00:09:43,020
And like it's hard to
imagine what better gift.

158
00:09:43,021 --> 00:09:46,050
There's confidence that I think you'd
get from your family and I think I got

159
00:09:46,051 --> 00:09:46,884
that too.

160
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:52,070
But the ability to just get
through adversities with
resilience and to have that

161
00:09:52,741 --> 00:09:55,560
hopeful feeling that things are
going to turn out all right.

162
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,960
Even though sometimes they don't,
you think they will again,

163
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,720
it's sustained me through my whole life.

164
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,440
Are there any particular examples that
you can think of or just approaches that

165
00:10:07,561 --> 00:10:11,970
you remember your father taking to
coach you through difficult times or

166
00:10:11,971 --> 00:10:16,971
difficult experiences when you were
perhaps not at the peak of confidence when

167
00:10:17,881 --> 00:10:22,740
you were suffering hardships?
What approach would he
have taken or did he take?

168
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,840
Well, I think, you know,
in small and large ways.

169
00:10:25,841 --> 00:10:30,790
I remember once I was in a concert
at school and, um, I was sitting,

170
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:34,300
we were singing old man
river and by mistake I,

171
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:37,090
instead of saying set of
singing old man river,

172
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:42,070
instead of saying he's tired
of living and scared of dying,

173
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:46,360
I said he's tired of dying
and scared of living.

174
00:10:46,361 --> 00:10:48,940
And I was so embarrassed and
after I came out and said,

175
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:51,630
that was much deeper what you said,
he's tired.

176
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:57,400
Is that incredibly, I felt great and we
went and had some ice cream, you know.

177
00:10:57,401 --> 00:11:00,220
And then of course,
because I was such a huge baseball fan,

178
00:11:00,221 --> 00:11:03,460
I had to get through the failure of
the Dodgers year after year after year,

179
00:11:03,461 --> 00:11:07,390
the Brooklyn Dodgers. And again, he
just said it will happen some year.

180
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:10,300
And he made me feel that wait
til next year will happen.

181
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:15,100
But probably more importantly, my mother
had had rheumatic fever as a child.

182
00:11:15,101 --> 00:11:19,690
So she had a damaged heart and really
was an invalid for most of my childhood.

183
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:24,850
And so he saw what I had to go through
and what he had to go through where she

184
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:28,450
was not well. She had several
small heart attacks and again,

185
00:11:28,451 --> 00:11:29,830
he just got her through it.

186
00:11:29,831 --> 00:11:33,130
Got me through it and it all
sounds so sad what I'm saying,

187
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:38,170
but my childhood bizarrely was not sad
and I think it had a lot to do with him.

188
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,220
You also mentioned,

189
00:11:41,221 --> 00:11:43,860
and part of the reason for
people listening that I'm
asking these questions and

190
00:11:43,861 --> 00:11:45,960
I'm so interested in you as a person,

191
00:11:45,961 --> 00:11:50,400
is that you are such a keen observer
and that's reflected in your writing.

192
00:11:50,401 --> 00:11:53,010
Certainly reflected in your
speaking as well that I'm,

193
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:58,070
I'm interested in the formation of
your character strengths and so on.

194
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,450
Baseball. Uh, you mentioned baseball,

195
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,690
I don't know much about your
background with baseball,

196
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,280
but is it true and I can't believe
everything I read on the Internet, so I,

197
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:13,380
I certainly stand to be fat corrected
anytime that you were the first woman to

198
00:12:13,811 --> 00:12:16,270
be invited into the red sox locker room.
Is that true?

199
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:19,390
Well, I don't know about the
first woman to be invited in,

200
00:12:19,391 --> 00:12:21,760
but I was the first journalist
to be for sure enlist.

201
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:27,030
I happened to be at spring training on
the day that the order came down from the

202
00:12:27,281 --> 00:12:31,000
courts saying that women journalists have
to be allowed into the locker room to

203
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:34,990
be able to do their job.
So the owners of the red sox said go in.

204
00:12:34,991 --> 00:12:39,100
So it happened that I was the first person
to go in and it actually is a trivial

205
00:12:39,101 --> 00:12:42,610
pursuit question and the New England
trivial percent yet. So it's a,

206
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:46,120
it's a great pride to have done it.
It wasn't that exciting to be honest.

207
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:50,410
I didn't see lots of guys in matters
of undress cause they, but they were,

208
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,540
I was there and I didn't
even have to interview them.

209
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:54,550
I just had to say I was there.
I'm okay.

210
00:12:56,150 --> 00:13:00,320
Have you always been a s as
long as you can remember a,

211
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:02,810
an Aficionado of baseball?
How did that develop?

212
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:08,500
I think in so many ways. Um, my love of
history came from my love of baseball.

213
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:12,640
My father had grown up in Brooklyn and
then move to long island just before I

214
00:13:12,641 --> 00:13:17,080
was born, but still love the Brooklyn
Dodgers. So when I was only five,

215
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,070
six years old,

216
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:21,970
he taught me that mysterious art of
keeping score while listening to baseball

217
00:13:21,971 --> 00:13:25,540
games so that I could record for
him like on a summer afternoon.

218
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,330
The history of that afternoon
was Brooklyn dodger game.

219
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,560
And then he would come home from work
on the long I train at night and I would

220
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:36,310
recount for him with all my miniaturized
symbols, the K for a strikeout,

221
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:38,690
getting the guy around the bases.
Um,

222
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:41,710
I could tell him every play of every
inning of the game that had taken place.

223
00:13:41,711 --> 00:13:46,210
And he made me feel, I was telling him
a fabulous story. So it makes you think,

224
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,200
even as a little girl,

225
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:50,740
there's something magic about history
to keep your father's attention for so

226
00:13:50,741 --> 00:13:52,150
long.
In fact,

227
00:13:52,151 --> 00:13:55,780
I'm convinced I learned the narrative
arts on those nightly sessions with my dad

228
00:13:55,781 --> 00:13:59,650
because at first I'd be so excited
before I went into the sewage rendition,

229
00:13:59,651 --> 00:14:02,260
I would say the Dodgers water,
the Dodgers lost,

230
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:04,750
which took the drama of
this two hour telling away.

231
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:08,680
So I finally learned you had to tell a
story from beginning to middle to end.

232
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:11,500
He made it even more special
for me when I was six.

233
00:14:11,501 --> 00:14:15,460
He never told me then that all of this
was actually described in great detail in

234
00:14:15,461 --> 00:14:18,790
the sports pages of the newspapers.
The next day I thought without me,

235
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,770
he wouldn't even know what
happened in the Brooklyn Dodgers.

236
00:14:20,771 --> 00:14:25,771
So it really did I think teach me
the importance of telling a story.

237
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:30,700
In fact, much later I read an essay by my
heroine, Barbara Tuchman, and she said,

238
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,390
even if you're writing about a
war is a narrative historian.

239
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,760
You have to imagine to yourself,
you do not know how that war ended.

240
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:40,420
So you can carry your reader with you
every step along the way from beginning to

241
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:44,140
middle to end, not being an all knowing
person that says, oh, they won this war.

242
00:14:44,141 --> 00:14:46,000
What's the drama if you
will already know that?

243
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,570
So I learned that just trying to keep my
father's attention and telling him the

244
00:14:49,571 --> 00:14:52,430
story step by step of what
happened to the Dodgers that day.

245
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:56,620
For those who don't know,
who is Barbara Tuchman?

246
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,300
Barbara Tuchman is a female historian
and I only mentioned female.

247
00:15:01,301 --> 00:15:05,850
His store in question is a very important
early female Pulitzer Prize winning

248
00:15:05,851 --> 00:15:06,684
historian.

249
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:10,770
And I read a book that she wrote guns of
August when I was in college and it was

250
00:15:10,771 --> 00:15:14,010
so beautifully written,
but more importantly for me,

251
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,490
she was writing about battles and
military stuff and things that you don't

252
00:15:17,491 --> 00:15:21,240
imagine that sometimes a woman might
be so adept at. But more importantly,

253
00:15:21,241 --> 00:15:26,130
she was just a beautiful storyteller
and writer. So as I, I met her later,

254
00:15:26,131 --> 00:15:29,820
but she became a mentor in my imagination
I think when I was in college.

255
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:35,270
No, the point at which
history enters the scene, uh,

256
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,460
as such labeled as such,

257
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:42,440
even if baseball and your f
your experiences with your
father perhaps introduced

258
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:47,360
you to crafting this narrative arc.
Did that start in high school?

259
00:15:47,361 --> 00:15:49,520
I had read,
I don't know if that's true or not,

260
00:15:49,521 --> 00:15:53,960
but I had read that you had a fantastic
history teacher in high school who I

261
00:15:53,961 --> 00:15:57,410
think won an award for best
history teacher in New York
state or something along

262
00:15:57,411 --> 00:15:58,790
those lines.
Was,

263
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:03,791
was that a very influential period for
you and when you were specifically in

264
00:16:05,511 --> 00:16:09,320
that class or were there, did history
somehow enter the picture prior to that?

265
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:11,530
Well,
I think beyond baseball,

266
00:16:11,531 --> 00:16:16,330
the other experience that led me to
love stories from the past is because my

267
00:16:16,331 --> 00:16:19,390
mother had had rheumatic fever
and had this damaged heart.

268
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:23,410
I love to listen to her tell
stories. I kept saying to her, mom,

269
00:16:23,411 --> 00:16:26,440
tell me stories about new when
you were a young girl like me.

270
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:31,540
I somehow thought if I could keep her mind
talking about days when she was young,

271
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:34,930
before her illness said in that her
mind would control her body and this

272
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,500
premature aging process we were
witnessing would be stopped in his tracks.

273
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:41,860
So I was constantly saying, mom, tell me
a story about you when you were my age,

274
00:16:41,861 --> 00:16:45,850
not realizing how peculiar that was until
my own three sons never once said to

275
00:16:45,851 --> 00:16:50,320
me, mom, tell us a story about you when
you're our age. But I think it, again,

276
00:16:50,321 --> 00:16:54,220
it instilled in me the idea
that stories from the past can,

277
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:58,270
can bring people who are different
alive when they were younger.

278
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:00,580
And then of course when I ended
up studying dead presidents,

279
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,490
trying to bring them to life.
So these two routes,

280
00:17:03,491 --> 00:17:07,300
I think of my father's love of baseball
and my wish that my mother could be

281
00:17:07,301 --> 00:17:11,470
younger and I could imagine her running
up the steps two at a time led to my

282
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,640
interest in the past.

283
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:16,840
But then I think when I got to high
school and wonderful high school in Long

284
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,870
Island, south side, senior high
school, his teacher, Ms. Austin,

285
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:23,830
who was the head of the social
studies department, she made you feel,

286
00:17:23,831 --> 00:17:24,750
when she was telling,

287
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:29,030
I remember about FDR death as if
she were experiencing it. You know,

288
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:34,030
her eyes filled up and she did indeed
win an award as the best history teacher

289
00:17:34,031 --> 00:17:34,811
in New York state.

290
00:17:34,811 --> 00:17:39,310
So all of us benefited by having
that chance to see his become alive.

291
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:43,660
I love history so much now and I just
wish that every kid in school would have a

292
00:17:43,661 --> 00:17:47,470
teacher with that kind of passion
because whenever I hear kids say, oh,

293
00:17:47,471 --> 00:17:50,580
it's boring, it's just a bunch of
facts. And I keep thinking, no,

294
00:17:50,581 --> 00:17:53,700
it's about people who lived before
they had drama in their lives. They,

295
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,320
they went through tough times.

296
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:58,560
Our country went through tough times
and the more you can learn from that

297
00:17:58,561 --> 00:18:01,260
perspective, just like learning
from your parents or grandparents,

298
00:18:01,261 --> 00:18:03,270
you're learning some generations ago,

299
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:07,260
and if I could just have a Ms.
Austin in every school in America,

300
00:18:07,261 --> 00:18:08,250
that would be my dream.

301
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:14,050
When did you decide that you
wanted to explore biography as a,

302
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:19,780
as a, I suppose you're, you're
one of your many explorations of,

303
00:18:19,781 --> 00:18:22,760
of literature and, uh, as a writer, when,

304
00:18:22,761 --> 00:18:27,200
when did that first come onto your radar?
Or did you first think of it?

305
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:31,850
No, I think we're biography came
from was Lyndon Johnson. Um,

306
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:35,250
when I was in graduate
school and in college,

307
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,760
I was really interested in the Supreme
Court and thought I might actually go to

308
00:18:38,761 --> 00:18:41,170
law school rather than graduate school.
Um,

309
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:45,660
but I did end up going to graduate school
and I had a great teacher at Harvard

310
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,550
Graduate School who taught the
history of the Supreme Court.

311
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,820
So my phd thesis was,
was on Supreme Court.

312
00:18:50,821 --> 00:18:54,870
So I might've been studying these guys
in their robes rather than my dead

313
00:18:54,871 --> 00:18:59,520
presidents were it not for the fact
that I got a White House Fellowship and

314
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:01,830
wonderful program that still exists today,

315
00:19:01,831 --> 00:19:06,831
which takes people from 23 to 48 or 50
perhaps and brings them to Washington for

316
00:19:07,951 --> 00:19:10,260
a year,
hoping that you'll get a sense of,

317
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:13,260
of the government and then go back
to your private life. You know,

318
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:16,710
having been enriched by that experience.
And I was at the young end,

319
00:19:16,711 --> 00:19:21,711
I was only 24 when I was chosen and
ended up in a peculiar way working for

320
00:19:21,811 --> 00:19:26,811
Lyndon Johnson and then helping him on
his memoirs the last years of his life.

321
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:29,520
And then writing my first
book on Lyndon Johnson.

322
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,950
So that's what set me
into presidential history.

323
00:19:31,951 --> 00:19:35,190
That's what sent me into biography.
That random experience,

324
00:19:35,191 --> 00:19:38,430
I mean chance plays a role in
so much of our lives. I think

325
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:43,850
I in the course of prepping
for this read that,

326
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:45,563
uh,

327
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:50,310
you had some doubts about
whether you would remain,

328
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,290
uh, in the White House. I, and I'm
paraphrasing here and pulling from memory,

329
00:19:55,291 --> 00:20:00,090
which isn't always my strong suit because
you had written an anti war peace,

330
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:01,603
uh,

331
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:06,650
and that I guess at the time the president
decided to keep you around and that

332
00:20:08,461 --> 00:20:10,170
if he couldn't convert you,
nobody.

333
00:20:10,171 --> 00:20:13,470
Could I end up just wondering a,

334
00:20:13,471 --> 00:20:18,471
if you could flesh that out a little bit
and be why he would make that type of

335
00:20:19,441 --> 00:20:20,274
decision?

336
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:23,870
Yes. What happened is when we were
chosen as White House fellows,

337
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:28,160
there was a big dance at the White House
and he did dance with me that night.

338
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:31,850
Not that peculiar. There were only three
women out of the 16 White House fellows.

339
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:33,740
But as he twirled me around the floor,

340
00:20:33,741 --> 00:20:36,830
he whispered that he wanted me
to be assigned directly to him.

341
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:41,870
But it was not to be that simple for in
the months prior to my selection as a

342
00:20:41,871 --> 00:20:43,730
White House fellow,
like many young people,

343
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:48,220
I was active in the Anti Vietnam War
movement and had written an article with a

344
00:20:48,221 --> 00:20:52,000
friend of mine that we had sent to the
new republic weeks before and had not

345
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:56,590
heard anything back on the need for a
third party candidate to challenge Lyndon

346
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:56,890
Johnson.

347
00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:00,940
So it came out with the title two days
after the dance and the White House,

348
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:04,720
how to remove Lyndon Johnson from power.
Oh my God.

349
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,870
I was certain he would kick me
out of the program, or even worse,

350
00:21:07,871 --> 00:21:12,430
he might destroy the entire program,
but instead, surprisingly, he said, oh,

351
00:21:12,431 --> 00:21:16,060
bring her down here for a year and
if I can't win her over, no one can.

352
00:21:16,061 --> 00:21:19,180
So I was not assigned directly
to him in the White House though.

353
00:21:19,181 --> 00:21:21,040
I think I was too incendiary for that.

354
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:24,310
So I was assigned to the Labor
Department under, well Edwards,

355
00:21:24,311 --> 00:21:25,840
who was a wonderful mentor.

356
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:31,200
And then Johnson withdrew from the race
in March of 1968 and right after he

357
00:21:31,421 --> 00:21:33,790
withdrew from the race, he called me
the White House and he said, well,

358
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:37,180
you said I should be removed from office.
I've now removed myself.

359
00:21:37,181 --> 00:21:40,600
Now you have to work for me the
rest of the time. And so I did.

360
00:21:40,601 --> 00:21:42,310
I went to the White House.
And then as I say,

361
00:21:42,311 --> 00:21:46,240
he asked me when the White
House fellowship and the
year working for him came to

362
00:21:46,241 --> 00:21:51,010
an end to help accompany him part time
to his ranch to help him on his memoirs.

363
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,300
He wanted me to come full time,

364
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,470
but I knew enough about Lyndon Johnson
then that if you were completely in his

365
00:21:56,471 --> 00:22:00,520
way, um, it was really hard to,
to keep your own sense of balance.

366
00:22:00,521 --> 00:22:04,690
So I asked him if I could just go part
time and go back to Harvard to start

367
00:22:04,691 --> 00:22:08,710
teaching, which is what I wanted to do.
And at first he said no all or nothing,

368
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:09,603
all or nothing.

369
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:13,000
So then the last day when he was in the
White House and he was going to leave,

370
00:22:13,001 --> 00:22:17,320
the next day, he called me
back and just said, okay, it's
all right. Come part time.

371
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,390
And then he just got to
me, he said, you know,

372
00:22:19,391 --> 00:22:22,930
it's not so easy when you're not in power
in the same way to get what you want.

373
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,020
I won't forget that you're doing this,
but just don't let those,

374
00:22:26,021 --> 00:22:30,490
Harvard's poison your feeling about me.
So that was the extraordinary experience.

375
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:34,210
I stayed at the ranch much of the time
I was there, got to know lady bird,

376
00:22:34,211 --> 00:22:38,050
got to know him very well, and, and
felt a great deal of empathy for him,

377
00:22:38,051 --> 00:22:40,390
even though he never changed
my mind about the war.

378
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:45,460
I did see extraordinary success that
he had had in the great society and in

379
00:22:45,461 --> 00:22:46,294
civil rights.

380
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:50,630
And I saw him struggle with how he would
be remembered in those last days and

381
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,420
last last years of his life.

382
00:22:52,421 --> 00:22:56,620
So it was a very emotional experience
led to my first book, Lyndon Johnson.

383
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:59,440
And then from there I became
a presidential that story.

384
00:22:59,441 --> 00:23:01,990
And somehow it wasn't that
I set out to become one.

385
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:07,460
What an incredible opportunity. I wonder,
and this is, I'll just ask you if,

386
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:09,560
if it's in an alternate universe,

387
00:23:09,561 --> 00:23:14,330
I were able to ask him
directly why he asked you, uh,

388
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:16,700
to help him. What do you think
he would say? I mean, he,

389
00:23:16,701 --> 00:23:19,850
he could have reached out to any
number of people. What did he,

390
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:23,770
what did he see in you or how would he
answer that question, do you think? Well,

391
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:27,220
he had a number of other people that
were working on the memoirs with him,

392
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:29,140
but I think to some extent,

393
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:33,250
because I was young and he knew that the
audience he wanted to reach where those

394
00:23:33,251 --> 00:23:36,880
young people, because he felt
that they hadn't understood him,

395
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,340
even though he liked to believe
he had done so much for them,

396
00:23:39,341 --> 00:23:43,850
which he had except for this, except for
this huge thing in the Vietnam war. Um,

397
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:45,040
he,
I was a woman,

398
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:49,550
so maybe it was easier to be
able to talk to me as a woman.

399
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:54,590
Um, and he knew that I loved listening to
stories and he was a great storyteller.

400
00:23:54,591 --> 00:23:57,680
I mean fabulous, colorful,
anecdotal stories.

401
00:23:57,681 --> 00:23:58,970
There was a problem where these stories,

402
00:23:58,971 --> 00:24:00,860
I later discovered that
half of them weren't true,

403
00:24:00,861 --> 00:24:04,730
but I loved listening on the less so I
think part of my attraction for him was

404
00:24:04,731 --> 00:24:07,610
that I love listening to his tall tales.
Um,

405
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,820
there was also a moment when I worried
that part of the reason he had me there

406
00:24:10,821 --> 00:24:14,840
was because I was a young woman, um,
because and but everything was perfect.

407
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:18,290
I kept talking to them
about steady boyfriends even
when I had no boyfriends at

408
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:22,310
all until one day he decided
to have a discussion.

409
00:24:22,311 --> 00:24:23,840
He said about our relationship,

410
00:24:23,841 --> 00:24:26,690
which sounded ominous when he
took me nearby to the lake,

411
00:24:26,691 --> 00:24:28,790
conveniently called Lake
Lyndon Baines Johnson.

412
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,210
There's wine and cheese and a rent check,
tape table course,

413
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,740
all the romantic trappings
and he starts out Doris,

414
00:24:33,741 --> 00:24:37,910
more than any other woman I have ever
known in, my heart sank. And then he said,

415
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,320
you remind me of my mother.

416
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:43,820
It was pretty classic and what was
going on in my mind. But nonetheless,

417
00:24:43,821 --> 00:24:46,430
I was there when we used
to walk on the ranch.

418
00:24:46,431 --> 00:24:50,180
I talk about this actually in the
epilogue of my new book because I tried to

419
00:24:50,181 --> 00:24:52,670
bring all four of my guys,
Lincoln,

420
00:24:52,671 --> 00:24:57,020
Teddy Franklin and Lbj to the whole
question of how they want it to be

421
00:24:57,021 --> 00:24:58,910
remembered over time.

422
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:03,230
So I described a lot of the scenes of
walking with him every day where he,

423
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:07,550
his mind was just going back over the
happier parts of his life and also the

424
00:25:07,551 --> 00:25:10,510
sadness of knowing that hopefully the,

425
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:14,750
or the sadness of knowing that the
Vietnam War had cut his legacy into,

426
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:20,020
but hoping that what he
did on civil rights would
receive some sort of bounty in

427
00:25:20,751 --> 00:25:23,120
the time to come.
And it certainly did and it has,

428
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:25,070
but he died before knowing that for sure.

429
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:29,790
When you mentioned earlier, and
uh, I'm, I'm paraphrasing here,

430
00:25:29,791 --> 00:25:34,791
but the referring to your decision
or your priority of doing,

431
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:39,690
uh, working with him part time, you said
something along the lines of when you,

432
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:44,520
when you were fully in his sway, it was
hard to maintain balance. So I decided to,

433
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:49,000
or asked for part time, uh,
what does that mean? Uh, if,

434
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,730
if you could elaborate on that,
on that,

435
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:55,520
you know, I think what it means is that
he was so powerful that you had a feeling

436
00:25:55,521 --> 00:25:59,690
sometimes that, um, you
couldn't get away from him.

437
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:03,230
He wanted me to be there every moment.
I mean, even when he took a nap,

438
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:07,700
he would want me to be sitting in a chair
right outside the closet just in case

439
00:26:07,701 --> 00:26:10,040
something happened to him or
just not wanting to be alone.

440
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:14,080
And this was a man who
needed company and you know,

441
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:19,490
I felt in some ways like a 24 years
old, am I going to be able to, you know,

442
00:26:19,491 --> 00:26:22,640
to say, no, I want to go to the
movies tonight or I want to,

443
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,090
I just need some time or I want to read.
Um,

444
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:28,160
even though it was an extraordinary
thing to be in his presence,

445
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:31,130
I remember one time in particular,
you're just sparked this memory,

446
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:34,970
which I haven't thought about.
When he would have visitors to the ranch,

447
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:38,840
he would take them in his car and
show them the jumping antelope,

448
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:43,010
bluebonnets all he did narrate the
whole beauty of the ranch to them.

449
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:47,250
And when I was first working down there,
I'd be in the front of the car with him.

450
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:50,820
It could be an important person in
the back, like Dean Rusk or something.

451
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,650
And he'd say to me, look, doors,

452
00:26:52,651 --> 00:26:55,920
look at the jumping antelopes but then
I remember one weekend I didn't go to

453
00:26:55,921 --> 00:26:58,860
visit him at the ranch. Um, and I
think he was mad that I hadn't gone,

454
00:26:58,861 --> 00:27:00,360
cause I'd stayed,
stayed at Harvard.

455
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,630
So the next time I was down I was in
the back of the car and he's saying to

456
00:27:03,631 --> 00:27:06,230
whoever's in the front of the
car, look, look at the jumping in.

457
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,900
I felt like I was in Siberia,
is the matter with me.

458
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,850
I don't even want to be in this car.

459
00:27:11,851 --> 00:27:13,950
I've seen these jumping in
a lot of the thousand times.

460
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:19,170
That was one of the Times I think I knew
that a small thing could be transferred

461
00:27:19,171 --> 00:27:20,550
into an arc of power.

462
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:25,740
And at least at enough sense to think as
long as I've got myself back at Harvard

463
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,380
and I can come on weekends,
I can come vacations.

464
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:31,380
It really was perfect and I also
want it to be back teaching.

465
00:27:31,381 --> 00:27:35,010
That's what I've been comparing. Four I
got my phd and I couldn't wait to teach,

466
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:39,000
so it was a balance I think between
the two, but it worked out really well.

467
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:41,280
Why couldn't you wait to teach?

468
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:47,750
I think I always talked or since I was
a little person telling stories and I,

469
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:52,680
I knew that if I could teach
now the kids at Harvard,

470
00:27:52,681 --> 00:27:56,250
it was later than getting them in
high school or elementary school,

471
00:27:56,251 --> 00:28:01,050
but at least then if I could make them
love history just as I had that I would

472
00:28:01,051 --> 00:28:05,880
be doing something meaningful because I
thought in passing on that passion and

473
00:28:05,881 --> 00:28:09,480
there could be one or two or three or
five kids in the class that might end up

474
00:28:09,481 --> 00:28:10,500
really loving history.

475
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,170
Even if they didn't go into it
maybe for the rest of their lives,

476
00:28:13,171 --> 00:28:17,070
they'd be reading history as they're
an avocation, not their vocation,

477
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:21,270
that I would do something that mattered
to me. So, and I really loved teaching.

478
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:21,601
I mean,

479
00:28:21,601 --> 00:28:25,530
I only stopped teaching when I got
married and had my kids and couldn't teach

480
00:28:25,531 --> 00:28:29,550
and write and be with the kids at the
same time. And it was scary. I mean, to,

481
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:33,630
to think of myself as suddenly becoming
a writer when I was much more sure of my

482
00:28:33,631 --> 00:28:36,810
ability to teach. So I
left, I left Harvard,

483
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,840
I had two kids immediately
after I was married, my husband,

484
00:28:39,841 --> 00:28:43,050
and I've already had a son from his
first marriage, his first wife had died.

485
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:47,670
So all of a sudden I have three boys and
I was finding myself hardly able to get

486
00:28:47,671 --> 00:28:51,780
through the day, much less get anything
done. So I had to make a choice.

487
00:28:51,781 --> 00:28:55,080
Will I continue teaching or
will I try and be a writer?

488
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,360
And so I had,

489
00:28:57,361 --> 00:29:01,800
luckily by that time finished the first
book on Lyndon Johnson and was going to

490
00:29:01,801 --> 00:29:04,020
be working on my next
book and had a contract,

491
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:07,710
but even then it took me 10 years to
finish the next book and I remember being

492
00:29:07,711 --> 00:29:11,450
at a cocktail party in Cambridge at
one point where somebody said whatever

493
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,650
happened to Doris Kearns anyway,
did she die?

494
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:17,550
I wanted to hit the person is they had
three boys. That's what's happened to me.

495
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:20,730
It was able to,
I was able to balance.

496
00:29:20,731 --> 00:29:24,960
I think being a writer better with
having the kids then I could if,

497
00:29:24,961 --> 00:29:27,210
if I were teaching and
writing and having the kids,

498
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:31,530
but every now and then when I lecture
and it's a 45 minute lecture or 50 minute

499
00:29:31,531 --> 00:29:33,960
lecture, I think yes, this
is what it used to be like

500
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:40,670
45 minutes is a,
it's a nice self encapsulated,

501
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:45,640
a beginning, middle and end compared
to perhaps 10 years. How did,

502
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:49,930
were there times when you didn't see
the light at the end of the tunnel or

503
00:29:49,931 --> 00:29:53,860
weren't sure if you were going to finish
and did you have any self moments of

504
00:29:53,861 --> 00:29:57,160
self doubt over that 10 year span? I
mean that's a lot to long period of time.

505
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:57,871
Well,

506
00:29:57,871 --> 00:30:01,500
in fact each of my books and taken such
a long period of time that there are

507
00:30:01,501 --> 00:30:03,990
certainly moments where you just think,
what am I doing?

508
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:08,040
I mean the book about Franklin and Eleanor
and World War II took longer to write.

509
00:30:08,041 --> 00:30:11,970
Then it took the war to be fought,
which is really embarrassing.

510
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:16,260
And the book on Teddy and Taft took
seven years and the book on Lincoln took

511
00:30:16,261 --> 00:30:17,160
nearly 10 years.

512
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:22,520
The reason is not as scary as it might
sound is that I always sort of have an

513
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:26,040
outline of knowing what I
want to do before I start.

514
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,520
It's sort of the lay person's,
I don't know that much about the person,

515
00:30:29,521 --> 00:30:32,460
so I want to know what do
people want to know about them.

516
00:30:32,461 --> 00:30:37,260
I'm not that much of an expert on the
person when I start and then I start

517
00:30:37,261 --> 00:30:41,100
building the book usually chronologically,
if not from their childhood,

518
00:30:41,101 --> 00:30:43,800
wherever I'm starting.
So chapters get done,

519
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:48,900
so it's not like I spend five years
researching and then start writing again.

520
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,490
Barbara Tuchman,
my heroines said,

521
00:30:50,491 --> 00:30:53,880
you've got to start writing as soon as
you can because otherwise you'll really

522
00:30:53,881 --> 00:30:57,690
feel this massive material is,
is unable to be worked on.

523
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:01,140
So yes, sure there were
times, but on the other hand,

524
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:04,030
it meant that I could have my own hours.
I,

525
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,660
my husband's was a rider
and we both wrote at home.

526
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:09,630
I didn't have to travel anywhere
to go and do what I was doing.

527
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:11,640
I didn't have faculty meetings at night.

528
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:14,340
I could be with the kids and I
could go to the little league games.

529
00:31:14,341 --> 00:31:19,341
And I really appreciated that I was
now in a profession that allowed me to

530
00:31:19,681 --> 00:31:23,400
balance as much as I could, even if
it meant I wouldn't produce 40 bucks.

531
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:24,443
I sometimes think,

532
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:29,460
what if I had been a man living in another
time and I wasn't involved with the

533
00:31:29,461 --> 00:31:31,350
kids. I mean, it's a sad
thing to think about.

534
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:34,500
Maybe I would have produced more books,
but I would never tried it.

535
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:40,610
Oh, I think, I think you're
doing spectacular. I have, uh,

536
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:43,160
as I was mentioning earlier,
uh,

537
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:48,170
such an incredible level of
respect for the work you've done.

538
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:51,950
It's, it's very intimidating.
Uh, uh, on some level,

539
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:55,300
I'm not sure it's intimidating,
but it's fat.

540
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,980
Yeah, no, for, it's

541
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,400
teasing me who read the bully pulpit in,

542
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:03,960
which was very long book actually.
I mean,

543
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:08,540
900 pages that she was reading it at
night in bed and she fell asleep and it

544
00:32:08,541 --> 00:32:09,374
broke her nose.

545
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:15,690
My new book is shorter than any of
those calls is going to be broken.

546
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:20,460
Well, let's, let's talk about
some of your guys and, uh,

547
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,540
per perhaps we could,

548
00:32:21,541 --> 00:32:24,270
we're going to bounce around quite a bit
and we can take this and just about any

549
00:32:24,271 --> 00:32:26,680
direction. But, uh, I,

550
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:31,740
I'd love to perhaps start with a
question about Lincoln and I've read that

551
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:39,470
you've said what's perhaps most
striking about Lincoln was emotional

552
00:32:39,771 --> 00:32:40,370
intelligence

553
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:44,240
and temperament. Uh, can you, can you,
can you explain what you mean by that?

554
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,920
Absolutely. I mean, I think when
we look at the quality of empathy,

555
00:32:48,921 --> 00:32:52,250
which I think isn't a critical
quality for any leader,

556
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:56,750
I think for some people it's inborn.
Others can develop it over time,

557
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:59,030
but for Lincoln,
even as a child,

558
00:32:59,031 --> 00:33:03,830
when his friends would be putting hot
coals on turtles to watch them wriggle,

559
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:07,550
he would stop them and say, this
isn't right. We can't do this.

560
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:12,910
Or there are times when he found somebody
drunk in a pit hole and everybody was

561
00:33:13,341 --> 00:33:17,570
walking by the person and he ended up
going back and picking that person up and

562
00:33:17,571 --> 00:33:19,790
bringing him,
carrying him to a home.

563
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:25,010
And you can see that in him as a
child, but it's more than that. I just,

564
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:28,970
I felt that living in his presence
that I could become a better person.

565
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,510
I don't always think that I,

566
00:33:30,511 --> 00:33:33,290
I have great respect for the
people that I've written about,

567
00:33:33,291 --> 00:33:34,850
but there was something about Lincoln's,

568
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:38,150
and even forgetting how it made
him a great leader, which it did,

569
00:33:38,151 --> 00:33:41,090
he just refused to let resentments faster.

570
00:33:41,091 --> 00:33:44,420
He refused to let himself get
jealous of people. I mean,

571
00:33:44,421 --> 00:33:48,680
it wasn't that he didn't have the normal
human emotions of jealousy or envy or

572
00:33:48,681 --> 00:33:52,760
anger, but he said, if you allow
those to fester, they will poison you.

573
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,070
So there would be times when,
you know,

574
00:33:55,071 --> 00:33:57,950
I might be jealous or something
or envious of something.

575
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:01,640
And I just remember I'd say Lincoln would
tell me, this isn't doing you any good.

576
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:05,480
You have to stop. I mean, there's
this extraordinary story of,

577
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:10,650
of Stanton who becomes his war secretary
and they had met when they were in the,

578
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:14,720
um, in the law practice together. And
the 1850 Stanton lived in Cincinnati.

579
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,210
Lincoln of course, is in
Springfield, Illinois.

580
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:21,890
But Stanton had a very national reputation
and had a big case to be tried in

581
00:34:21,891 --> 00:34:24,830
Chicago. So the thought they needed
someone of council in Illinois,

582
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:27,800
his partner came and looked at
Lincoln saw he'd be finally getting,

583
00:34:27,801 --> 00:34:31,500
it was so excited at the thought of
working with this extraordinary lawyers,

584
00:34:31,501 --> 00:34:33,380
Stanton.
But at the last minute,

585
00:34:33,381 --> 00:34:36,680
the case got transferred
from Illinois to Cincinnati.

586
00:34:36,681 --> 00:34:39,680
So they didn't need Lincoln anymore,
but they forgot to tell him.

587
00:34:39,681 --> 00:34:42,950
So he kept working on his brief.
He went to Cincinnati all on his own.

588
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:47,060
He met up with Stanton and
Stanton's partner on the
street corner and he said in

589
00:34:47,061 --> 00:34:51,410
his typically gregarious way, let's go
up to the courthouse together and again,

590
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:55,070
stat and took one. Look at Lincoln.
He had a huge stain on his shirt.

591
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,390
His hair was disheveled,

592
00:34:56,391 --> 00:34:59,960
his arm sleeves are too short
for his long arms and legs.

593
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:03,410
And he turned to his partner and the
partner said this later and said,

594
00:35:03,411 --> 00:35:08,120
we have to lose this long
armed ape. It's awful, right?

595
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,300
And linkedin was humiliated
and they didn't open the brief.

596
00:35:11,301 --> 00:35:12,710
He had painstakingly prepared.

597
00:35:12,711 --> 00:35:17,240
But the amazing thing is he stayed and
watched the entire trial for a week

598
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,630
because he could see that there was some
brilliance and Stan and he wanted to

599
00:35:20,631 --> 00:35:23,690
learn from him. And he went back to
Springfield, Illinois. And he said,

600
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:26,270
I still have to learn how
to become a better lawyer.

601
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,270
So he would stay up later at night.
He'd get up early in the morning.

602
00:35:29,271 --> 00:35:33,740
He taught himself Euclid when he was
on the, on the on circuit in Illinois,

603
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:36,060
but most much more amazing life.

604
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:39,840
So after his first secretary
of war has had to resign,

605
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,580
everybody comes to him and said,

606
00:35:41,581 --> 00:35:45,300
the only person that can mobilize the
north and mobilize the war department is

607
00:35:45,301 --> 00:35:49,440
Edwin Stanton. He's tough. He can be a
bully at times. He can be insensitive,

608
00:35:49,441 --> 00:35:50,370
but he's your God.

609
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:54,950
And Somehow Lincoln was able to put that
past hurt behind him and give Stanton

610
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,790
that most incredibly important job.

611
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:00,940
And in Kane came out eventually loving
Lincoln more than anyone outside his

612
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,510
family.
Now that's a story that just,

613
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:06,180
it tells everything you want
to know about him. He said,

614
00:36:06,181 --> 00:36:10,290
I don't care if somebody disliked
me or like me in the past,

615
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:14,010
if somebody's been guilty of
ill treatment or abusive me,

616
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:16,770
if they're right at
this time in this place,

617
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,150
they're the right person for the time.

618
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:21,210
I trust that I'll be able to bring
out the best in them. And he did.

619
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:28,800
It's really incredible to hear these
types of stories and I think that it's

620
00:36:30,491 --> 00:36:32,950
worth digging into perhaps
some more examples,

621
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:38,050
and I'd love to get your definition
or how you think about temperament.

622
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,580
Uh, because I've, I've,

623
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:44,610
I've read you describing temperament as
the greatest separator in presidential

624
00:36:45,041 --> 00:36:47,650
leadership and maybe we could scratch
the presidential from that phrase.

625
00:36:47,651 --> 00:36:51,760
I don't know. Uh, but I, and I
think it was, let me get this right.

626
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:56,610
Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr who said,
uh, about FDR, right? A psyche,

627
00:36:56,660 --> 00:37:00,670
he has a second class intellect about a
first class temperament. What does that,

628
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:01,600
what does that mean to you?

629
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:07,620
I think what temporary means really is
your basic stance toward people toward

630
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:09,700
the world. Um, does it,

631
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:13,660
if you have the kind of temperament
that's got a certain base of confidence in

632
00:37:13,661 --> 00:37:17,560
it so that you can surround yourself
with people who can argue with you and

633
00:37:17,561 --> 00:37:18,820
question your assumptions,

634
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:22,450
do you have a temperament that allows
you to share credit when something goes

635
00:37:22,451 --> 00:37:26,200
well, to take the blame when
something goes badly? Um,

636
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:28,390
do you bring out the best in other people?

637
00:37:28,391 --> 00:37:31,870
Do you make them want to work because
you have a common sense of mission?

638
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:35,320
All of these are the basic way
you treat other people. I mean,

639
00:37:35,321 --> 00:37:38,650
I suppose it is encompassed
in emotional intelligence,

640
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:41,500
but I think you're born
with a certain temperament,

641
00:37:41,501 --> 00:37:44,140
but you also can develop a
certain temperament over time.

642
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:46,690
And I do think Oliver
Wendell Holmes was right.

643
00:37:46,691 --> 00:37:50,560
I don't think it was right that
FDR had a second rate intellect.

644
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,100
I think that's defining
intellect by academic excellence.

645
00:37:54,101 --> 00:37:55,750
And he was a mediocre student at,

646
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,540
at Harvard and a mediocre
student at Columbia Law School.

647
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:01,420
But he had an incredible
problem solving mind.

648
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,420
And he had the ability to
bring people around him,

649
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:08,170
experts in all the academic fields.
And these start out these evenings,

650
00:38:08,171 --> 00:38:12,310
these brain trust evenings where they
just relax and tell funny stories and have

651
00:38:12,311 --> 00:38:14,920
a couple drinks.
And then he would start questioning them.

652
00:38:14,921 --> 00:38:17,740
And he was an incredible question or,
and he could bring out,

653
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:20,440
it was almost as if he was
excavating their brain.

654
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:24,160
And whenever he heard by verbal thing,
he could remember.

655
00:38:24,161 --> 00:38:28,150
People remember in very different ways.
I mean, Lincoln remembered when he read,

656
00:38:28,151 --> 00:38:31,540
he had an extraordinary memory that if
you read something over and over again,

657
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:35,020
it would stick in his brain like a
poem or a piece of Shakespeare's drama.

658
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:37,990
FDR learned by listening to other people.

659
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:40,870
And once he had the story in his own mind,

660
00:38:40,871 --> 00:38:43,650
he could then tell it to somebody else.
So that,

661
00:38:43,651 --> 00:38:46,270
and that's intelligence is
of a different sword I think.

662
00:38:46,271 --> 00:38:50,300
Then just doing well on a series of
exams when you're in school. Okay.

663
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:56,880
If we're looking at say attributes
versus skills that are developed,

664
00:38:58,211 --> 00:39:03,130
are the nature versus nurture
aspect of some of these abilities,

665
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:07,390
uh, or the temperament as you
mentioned. If we look at say,

666
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:11,830
and I think I'm getting this
right, uh, the Lincoln quote,

667
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:14,730
I either your opponent's Today,
maybe your allies tomorrow, what's,

668
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:17,860
was he always that way or
is that something that he

669
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:23,280
developed over time and became better at?

670
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:27,230
No, I think he did develop it over
time. In fact, I think most of these,

671
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:32,000
there are attributes that may be in born
that are perhaps like intelligence or

672
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:36,970
maybe even people's skills. Um,
empathy as I say, maybe in born. Um,

673
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:39,920
but the ability to
communicate in some ways,

674
00:39:39,921 --> 00:39:42,470
but you can develop all
of these as time goes on.

675
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:45,350
And I think that's the important
thing for leaders to understand.

676
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:49,010
But in his case, I think,
um, when he was younger,

677
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:54,250
he had an extraordinary sense of humor
and he could really take down an opponent

678
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:56,780
by making fun of him.
And,

679
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:59,960
and he did that on a couple occasions
and there was one time when at the

680
00:39:59,961 --> 00:40:02,720
audience loved what he was doing
and making fun of the opponent.

681
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:04,730
And then he saw the
opponent Ponant leaving,

682
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:08,900
leaving the audience and with tears in
his eyes. And he just said to himself,

683
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:11,450
this isn't worth it.
This is not the way you do it.

684
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:16,490
So he learned from the experience of
feeling guilt at taking down an opponent

685
00:40:16,491 --> 00:40:21,140
that way, that if it were possible
to bring him on your side eventually.

686
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,660
I mean, obviously when he's
in the middle of the war,

687
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:27,530
the confederates are his opponents.
But even there,

688
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:29,490
when you look at that second inaugural,

689
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:32,840
what is he doing in that second
inaugural weeks before he dies,

690
00:40:32,841 --> 00:40:37,220
but saying both sides,
you know both sides read the same Bible,

691
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:38,750
both prayed to the same God.

692
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,800
Neither his prayers were fully answered
where he's acknowledging that the North

693
00:40:42,801 --> 00:40:44,120
had had problems with slavery,

694
00:40:44,121 --> 00:40:47,540
justice the South had and then with
malice toward non in charity for all,

695
00:40:47,541 --> 00:40:51,830
let us bind up the nation's wounds.
That's the the the words that say it,

696
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:57,160
but what really says it was that night
when he's elected president in 1860 he

697
00:40:57,621 --> 00:41:01,220
knows he's had least much less
experience than any of us three rivals.

698
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,880
They were more celebrated, more educated
ones, but they'd been governors.

699
00:41:04,881 --> 00:41:09,710
They'd been senators, Seward, chase and
Bates and he realizes I need their help.

700
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,090
The country is in peril.

701
00:41:11,091 --> 00:41:15,020
These are the strongest and most able men
in the country. I need them by my side.

702
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,840
He brings them into the top
three positions in his cabinet.

703
00:41:17,841 --> 00:41:19,850
Some of his friends say,
why are you doing this?

704
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:23,360
You're going to look like a figure head
having these strong people around you.

705
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:25,610
And he said,
I need them and I'll be fine.

706
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:29,180
And at the beginning some of them thought
they were more important than he was

707
00:41:29,181 --> 00:41:30,140
sued.
In particular,

708
00:41:30,141 --> 00:41:33,890
his secretary of state thought he was
running the show and that Lincoln would be

709
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:37,790
like a figurehead, but then at a certain
point like, and saw what sword was doing.

710
00:41:37,791 --> 00:41:39,980
He knew he needed him, but he
put him in his place. He said,

711
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,380
I am the president and I will do this.

712
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:47,150
And they too became great friends and
Seward ended up admiring him more than

713
00:41:47,151 --> 00:41:47,871
anybody else.

714
00:41:47,871 --> 00:41:52,700
So I think he had an internal confidence
that he could bring these opponents

715
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:56,780
into as myths, but it wasn't easy. It
meant holding hands with a lot of them.

716
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,550
It meant having to chew them out.

717
00:41:58,551 --> 00:42:02,670
When they started bringing their anger
toward each other out in public and, and,

718
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:04,280
and he had to keep going at it.

719
00:42:04,281 --> 00:42:07,370
It's much harder than if you have the
same people around you who are all in the

720
00:42:07,371 --> 00:42:11,060
same direction. You may not have as
many arguments and as many troubles,

721
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:14,840
but he was able to contain those
factions within his cabinet.

722
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:17,330
And then he was containing it in the
country at large because they each

723
00:42:17,331 --> 00:42:21,200
represented a certain segment
of the population, whether
it's radical, moderate,

724
00:42:21,201 --> 00:42:24,500
or conservative.
So it's an extraordinary way to do it.

725
00:42:24,501 --> 00:42:27,890
But the interesting thing is, you know,
when I've talked to business leaders,

726
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:32,540
a lot of them said they were able to,
maybe, maybe not in that extreme way,

727
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,700
having those kind of rivals with you,

728
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:39,140
but to understand the importance of
bringing people near you who really can

729
00:42:39,141 --> 00:42:42,350
argue and question your assumptions.
There's, there's a moment,

730
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:43,790
the same thing with FDR.

731
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:48,740
He's in a room with a bunch of generals
early before the ward even started the

732
00:42:48,741 --> 00:42:49,670
Second World War.

733
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:54,830
And he's describing some pet project
that he loved and all of them are shaking

734
00:42:54,831 --> 00:42:58,340
their heads and said, well,
that's wonderful. And he
looks over at George Marshall,

735
00:42:58,370 --> 00:43:03,080
who eventually of course,
becomes the chief of staff.
And he says, George, you're,

736
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:06,140
you're not shaking your head. What do you
think? And he said, well, Mr President,

737
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:07,670
I don't agree with you at all.

738
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:11,020
And the room came to a silence and
everybody laughed and then thought,

739
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:12,830
well that's it for George Marshall.

740
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:17,300
And then he appointed him not long after
bringing him up like 14 names on the

741
00:43:17,301 --> 00:43:21,560
list are more to be the head because he
wanted that kind of person around him.

742
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:26,030
So it's that strength. I think that inner
confidence that allows you to do that.

743
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,970
That's a critical question
in all leadership capacities.

744
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:35,060
Did you have any people you
surround yourself with who
you know will speak truth

745
00:43:37,291 --> 00:43:42,291
to you or who have wildly divergent
opinions or political perspectives?

746
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:47,730
Is that something that you have
practically built into your life?

747
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,780
Or did you just have people already
who surrounding you who offer those

748
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:55,800
opportunities to hear dissenting opinions?

749
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:59,230
You know, it's, it's a really important
question. I mean, I think in my work,

750
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:04,480
so I've had a woman who's been my research
assistant for the last 35 years and

751
00:44:04,481 --> 00:44:08,080
she's still working for
me. Beth, who's my manager,

752
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:12,700
my best friend, my partner in a
lot of things that we do together,

753
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:17,980
um, lives in California, has worked with
me for the last 18 years and I trust her,

754
00:44:17,981 --> 00:44:22,060
I think more than almost anybody to tell
me when something I've done is not up

755
00:44:22,061 --> 00:44:26,260
to par when something I've written
is not as good as it should be. Um,

756
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:30,520
and when, um, when maybe I'm, I'm
moving in some different direction.

757
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:35,520
And then my husband and I have a best
friend named Michael Rothschild who was a

758
00:44:35,521 --> 00:44:39,870
writer and a sculpture and lives in Maine
and he has worked with both my husband

759
00:44:39,871 --> 00:44:42,390
and me and we've worked within
on everything we write together,

760
00:44:42,391 --> 00:44:45,180
everything we do together.
And he's absolutely,

761
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:50,430
I'm honest about this sentence isn't any
good or this year not making this clear.

762
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:55,650
So that's built in in a certain sense.
I'm not sure that I did it on the purpose,

763
00:44:55,830 --> 00:45:00,300
but they, they are the kind
of people, Beth and Michael
and my husband, of course,

764
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:04,740
my husband read every single thing
I've written and not only edited them,

765
00:45:04,741 --> 00:45:05,790
but would tell me when,

766
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:09,090
when I was going off in a
direction that really wasn't right.

767
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:12,150
I remember when I was working
on the book on the Kennedys,

768
00:45:12,151 --> 00:45:15,960
and I'd always been interested in
medical history because the, um,

769
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:19,670
my sisters were both nurses and
my brother in law was a doctor.

770
00:45:19,671 --> 00:45:23,400
And because of my mother's medical
history, so John Fitzgerald,

771
00:45:23,401 --> 00:45:26,790
Rose Kennedy's father had gone to
Harvard Medical School for a year and I

772
00:45:26,791 --> 00:45:27,780
thought, oh, this is great.

773
00:45:27,781 --> 00:45:31,200
I can write a whole chapter on the state
of medicine and the 1880s, you know,

774
00:45:31,201 --> 00:45:32,880
and then my husband
looks at it and he says,

775
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:36,180
but he dropped out of medical
school and he became a politician.

776
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:41,250
Why are you doing this? And Oh, I hated
to make that chapter go down to two pages,

777
00:45:41,251 --> 00:45:42,660
but he was just dead.
Right.

778
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:47,920
But the other thing that happens that
bill bill's in descent is that, um, we,

779
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,650
we live in Concord,
Massachusetts.

780
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:53,460
And ever since the kids have been grown
and the kids are now joining us cause

781
00:45:53,461 --> 00:45:56,880
they live back in the town, which
I can talk about later. But anyway,

782
00:45:56,881 --> 00:46:00,440
we'd go out every night to eat at a bar,
one of this,

783
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:04,920
two or three bars in Concord that the
whole gang of us goes to one, one night,

784
00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:09,300
one the other night and the next one the
next night. And in that group of people,

785
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:12,960
there are Trump supporters.
There are radical people,

786
00:46:12,961 --> 00:46:15,960
there are moderate people and we
argue and talk about politics.

787
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:20,220
And I think it's really important for
me to be able to listen to goes other

788
00:46:20,221 --> 00:46:23,850
sides when I'm going to be talking on
television or thinking about today as

789
00:46:23,851 --> 00:46:25,530
opposed to thinking about the past.

790
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:31,440
Let's say you're having one of those group
conversations. You're at a restaurant,

791
00:46:31,441 --> 00:46:35,870
slash, bar. So there may or may
not be alcohol involved. Maybe

792
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:41,910
if things get heated,
how do you or other people in the group,

793
00:46:41,911 --> 00:46:46,890
are there any particular phrases you use
or interjections you use to cool things

794
00:46:46,891 --> 00:46:51,330
a little bit? If they start getting to
ad Hominem or too heated is there is,

795
00:46:51,970 --> 00:46:56,970
and I guess what I'm stretching for here
is if there are any tools or phrases,

796
00:46:57,841 --> 00:47:02,841
approaches that people might use to create
environments where a group like that

797
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:07,920
can actually communicate and hear each
other's opinions without devolving into a

798
00:47:07,921 --> 00:47:08,790
verbal fistfight.

799
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:12,530
Yeah. And obviously, you know,
all over the country right now,

800
00:47:12,531 --> 00:47:16,310
it's a difficult situation where some
places you go in bars and they won't even

801
00:47:16,311 --> 00:47:20,060
put the news on because they're afraid
it will rile the people and make them

802
00:47:20,061 --> 00:47:24,800
unhappy. So it's, it's not been easy
discussions, not only this time,

803
00:47:24,801 --> 00:47:28,880
but we've had a tribal feeling about
Democrats and Republicans for some time

804
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:31,330
through Obama to Clinton to Bush.

805
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:35,740
And I guess the best thing is as
long as you can just ask the people,

806
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:39,550
why do you feel that way?
Um, what, what makes you,

807
00:47:39,551 --> 00:47:41,410
what parts of him do you like?

808
00:47:41,411 --> 00:47:44,140
Or do you like this part of
what he's saying or not that,

809
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:47,510
and you can sort of parse it out
or they can ask us, you know,

810
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:51,840
why did you like Hillary? Oh, why, why
did you think she'd be okay? You know,

811
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:55,360
even though they might've thought she
was a terrible candidate and as long as

812
00:47:55,361 --> 00:47:59,230
you can acknowledge, you know, that
yes, parts of her candidacy didn't work,

813
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:02,440
but this is what I thought she was
prepared for. Or on the other hand,

814
00:48:02,441 --> 00:48:05,170
they could say he touched
a chord Trump did.

815
00:48:05,171 --> 00:48:09,580
And people who felt they were being
left out and people who felt that they

816
00:48:09,581 --> 00:48:13,990
weren't being listened to. Um, and
then, and then sometimes it does,

817
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:17,110
sometimes if it gets too
hard, then we just say, okay,

818
00:48:17,111 --> 00:48:20,020
let's have another drink and change
the subject and talk about the red sox.

819
00:48:20,610 --> 00:48:24,790
That's what does it. And there may, there
may be some Yankee fans in the group,

820
00:48:24,791 --> 00:48:27,190
but usually it's not. So not, not up here.

821
00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:29,590
So the red sox are a very calming device.

822
00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:34,420
Not Mad at them too because they,
but not this summer, this summer.

823
00:48:34,421 --> 00:48:35,254
They're doing great.

824
00:48:35,990 --> 00:48:40,230
So, so this is, uh, what we're
discussing in this type of, uh,

825
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:46,440
looking for a different adjective but
still civil is fine. Civil discussion,

826
00:48:46,441 --> 00:48:51,150
civil discourse about some, uh, these
potentially polarizing topics. We,

827
00:48:51,151 --> 00:48:54,300
that is a skill that can be developed.
Do you have to practice?

828
00:48:54,301 --> 00:48:59,130
But it can be developed and
I'd love to look back at,

829
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:02,650
uh,
some of your guys and to,

830
00:49:02,651 --> 00:49:07,650
to look at perhaps some of the mistakes,
failures or roadblocks,

831
00:49:07,710 --> 00:49:12,120
which I know you, you discuss, uh,
very, very directly in the new book,

832
00:49:12,810 --> 00:49:15,420
uh, to, to, to maybe

833
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:19,710
give an illustration of something they,

834
00:49:19,770 --> 00:49:23,890
they perhaps weren't very good at
that then later became good at, uh,

835
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:28,690
just to show us, uh, give us
some historical examples of, uh,

836
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:29,160
those,

837
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:33,240
those early mistakes slash weaknesses
slash roadblocks and how they dealt with

838
00:49:33,241 --> 00:49:34,060
them.

839
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:38,140
Well, I mean, taking both Teddy Roosevelt
and Franklin Roosevelt, for example,

840
00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:43,330
in both of them had grown
up in an extraordinary
privileged background and both

841
00:49:43,331 --> 00:49:45,250
had a certain kind of snobbishness.

842
00:49:45,251 --> 00:49:47,590
I think about people who
are not in their class.

843
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:49,690
When Teddy Roosevelt went to Harvard,

844
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:53,500
he looked up the names of potential
friends to see if they were on the social

845
00:49:53,501 --> 00:49:57,730
register so that he would know they'd
be safe for him to be friendly with.

846
00:49:58,270 --> 00:50:01,780
But then interestingly, he always was
interested in the outdoors, in fact,

847
00:50:01,781 --> 00:50:04,660
in part because he was suffering
from terrible asthma as a child.

848
00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:09,690
So we had to build the body that
would allow him to become a man and,

849
00:50:09,691 --> 00:50:10,690
and to live on.

850
00:50:10,990 --> 00:50:14,830
So in the summers he would go to Maine
with these guides and they would kind of

851
00:50:14,831 --> 00:50:18,850
backwoods been guys and he just loved
being with them and he loved asking them

852
00:50:18,851 --> 00:50:19,810
about their lives.

853
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:22,780
He had always been interested in curious
and other lives through literature,

854
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:27,100
but now he was seeing them. They knew the
woods, they knew things he didn't know.

855
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:30,560
And all of a sudden the fact that he
read more books than they did seemed less

856
00:50:30,561 --> 00:50:34,250
important. But even so when he first
got into the state legislature,

857
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,040
he was a fiery kind of character.

858
00:50:37,041 --> 00:50:41,330
And he went after a judge who we thought
was corrupt and he pounded his desk and

859
00:50:41,331 --> 00:50:45,830
he said terrible things about him. And
he got a swelled head when the judge was,

860
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:47,840
was undone by the newspapers.

861
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:52,400
And then he realized that he'd become
so self important that he thought the

862
00:50:52,401 --> 00:50:54,620
Democrats on the other side,
we're terrible people.

863
00:50:54,621 --> 00:50:58,160
He wasn't dealing with them that only
he knew what was right. And as he said,

864
00:50:58,161 --> 00:50:59,180
I rose like a rocket.

865
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:03,560
And then I fell to the ground and he
finally decided that you had to compromise

866
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:07,340
and collaborate and be with
other people and learn from them.

867
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:11,570
So an FDR, similarly, when he first
got into the state legislature,

868
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:13,220
he did very well at the beginning.

869
00:51:13,221 --> 00:51:15,680
He was organizing a group of
people and he thought that the,

870
00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:20,000
the Tammany bosses were all bad people.
And then he began to see my God,

871
00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:22,520
they may be doing some corrupt things,

872
00:51:22,521 --> 00:51:25,520
but they also are helping people
in the cities there. They,

873
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:29,270
the people who vote for them do it
because they come to their funerals,

874
00:51:29,271 --> 00:51:31,250
they get them food,
they get the full fuel,

875
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:35,330
and he moderated his kind
of approach to politics.

876
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:36,890
But that's the thing that,

877
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:40,250
you know what Teddy said at one point
was the great thing about being a

878
00:51:40,251 --> 00:51:44,060
politician more than if he
had chosen another field,

879
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:47,630
and I'm not so sure it's true today,
but it was then he said, I man,

880
00:51:47,631 --> 00:51:51,650
who takes an active part in the political
life of a great city is going to be

881
00:51:51,651 --> 00:51:53,990
meeting all sorts of people as a result,

882
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,210
and that's what he called fellow feeling,

883
00:51:56,211 --> 00:52:00,260
which he said was essential for
any democracy. He said that by,

884
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:03,970
by going to places that he normally
wouldn't go, he went to tenements.

885
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:07,130
He was a police commissioner and
he roamed the slums at night.

886
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:08,840
It was a civil service commissioner,

887
00:52:08,841 --> 00:52:12,110
so we understood what it was like to
take an exam and want to have a job for

888
00:52:12,111 --> 00:52:14,840
that kind of clerkship.
He was in the army,

889
00:52:14,841 --> 00:52:18,490
he had fellow soldiers that he was
leading and he lived with them and this in

890
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:19,700
the same kind of tent.

891
00:52:20,090 --> 00:52:24,410
All of that broadened his experience
that he would not have had as a child and

892
00:52:24,411 --> 00:52:26,180
by the time he reached the presidency,

893
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:31,070
he had what he called that sense of
civic life being marked by understanding

894
00:52:31,071 --> 00:52:32,600
other people's points of view.

895
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:35,300
It's the very thing that's
missing in our country today.

896
00:52:35,301 --> 00:52:39,950
He said a large part of the ranker of
political and social strife arises from

897
00:52:39,951 --> 00:52:42,350
misunderstanding by one
section of one class.

898
00:52:42,350 --> 00:52:45,290
They're so cut off from each other
that they don't appreciate each other's

899
00:52:45,291 --> 00:52:49,550
passions and prejudices and because he
had spent time in the West where he went

900
00:52:49,551 --> 00:52:53,270
after his wife and his mother died on
the same day in the same house to escape

901
00:52:53,271 --> 00:52:56,450
his depression. He saw a
cowboys, he was a cowboy,

902
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:00,440
and it's that breadth of experience
that I think all leaders need to.

903
00:53:00,850 --> 00:53:03,950
It can come through curiosity,
it can come possibly through reading,

904
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:07,640
but it comes to meeting people of
different sections and different places.

905
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,190
And that's what politics
in the best sense can do.

906
00:53:10,191 --> 00:53:14,300
But today I think they're much more
narrowed down to the people who agree with

907
00:53:14,301 --> 00:53:17,510
them and they don't have that same
broad experience that they used to.

908
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:24,410
There are people in government listening
to this podcast and I do know that

909
00:53:24,411 --> 00:53:26,010
there are a number of senators who

910
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:30,360
subscribed to the podcast
and various policymakers.

911
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:32,930
What are some recommendations
you would have if,

912
00:53:32,950 --> 00:53:36,630
if they want to develop
that broader perspective.

913
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:41,070
Are there any particular
actions you might suggest?

914
00:53:41,071 --> 00:53:43,470
Any particular habits that just got a,

915
00:53:43,471 --> 00:53:48,450
based on the historical accounts in
your research of these larger than life

916
00:53:48,451 --> 00:53:53,451
figures that they could in the
current day somehow incorporate to,

917
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:57,210
uh, develop these types of
attributes that we're talking about?

918
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,490
I do believe there are.
I mean, think about it.

919
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:05,800
Lincoln used to have ordinary people
come into his office in the morning and,

920
00:54:05,830 --> 00:54:08,830
and just talk to him about what
they wanted. They wanted a job.

921
00:54:08,831 --> 00:54:10,540
This is the days before civil service.

922
00:54:10,870 --> 00:54:13,270
And he listened to their
family discussions.

923
00:54:13,271 --> 00:54:17,050
He listened to why that clerkship or
that post ship would matter to them.

924
00:54:17,350 --> 00:54:21,160
And after a while his secretary's Nikolay
and Hey said to him, Mr President,

925
00:54:21,161 --> 00:54:23,680
you don't have time for these ordinary
people. He said, you're wrong.

926
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:27,070
I must never forget the popular
assemblage from which I have come.

927
00:54:27,490 --> 00:54:32,440
So Teddy Roosevelt took whistle stop
tours on a train six weeks in the spring

928
00:54:32,441 --> 00:54:33,274
and in the fall.

929
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:36,970
And he went to places where he'd been
defeated as well as places where he had

930
00:54:36,971 --> 00:54:37,720
one.

931
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:40,990
And then he would stop the train at the
local station and listen to newspaper

932
00:54:40,991 --> 00:54:44,350
editors. You know, who would be
criticizing something he was doing.

933
00:54:44,350 --> 00:54:48,790
He'd be talking to ordinary people. You
have to get out of the office. I mean,

934
00:54:48,791 --> 00:54:53,791
FDR was not able because of his paralysis
to go around the country as much as

935
00:54:54,041 --> 00:54:58,930
Teddy Roosevelt was, but he sent
on or his wife 200 days a year,

936
00:54:58,931 --> 00:55:01,510
she would be going from one
new deal project to the other,

937
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:04,330
seeing which ones were working,
which ones wasn't. Bringing him back.

938
00:55:04,331 --> 00:55:07,510
Stories of people who are
hurting during the depression,

939
00:55:07,690 --> 00:55:12,010
the stories that he needed to
really to really work and Lbj.

940
00:55:12,370 --> 00:55:14,650
If you look at the way he
dealt with the congress,

941
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:17,800
why was he so brilliant and getting
the two sides of the aisle together?

942
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:21,940
Because in the first six months
of his presidency after JFK died,

943
00:55:22,210 --> 00:55:25,960
he had every single congressmen over
in groups of 30 to the White House.

944
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:30,190
They would then have started with drinks
together and then lady bird would take

945
00:55:30,191 --> 00:55:34,150
the spouses and those days on a tour of
the mansion and then they would sit and

946
00:55:34,151 --> 00:55:37,210
talk and then he would call
them up at six in the morning.

947
00:55:37,210 --> 00:55:40,150
He'd call them at noon and he'd call
even a senator at 2:00 AM he said,

948
00:55:40,151 --> 00:55:42,850
I hope I didn't wake you up,
but I just need your advice.

949
00:55:42,851 --> 00:55:46,300
And then the senator says, oh no, I was
just lying here looking at the ceiling,

950
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:47,830
hoping my president would call.

951
00:55:48,050 --> 00:55:53,050
But nothing beats spending time with
different people and not letting your day

952
00:55:54,341 --> 00:55:58,180
get filled up just with the colleagues
and the and the people in the government

953
00:55:58,181 --> 00:55:59,200
itself.
I mean,

954
00:55:59,201 --> 00:56:03,280
Fdr said when he was putting over
the papers to the FDR library,

955
00:56:03,281 --> 00:56:05,350
the first presidential library,
you said,

956
00:56:05,351 --> 00:56:08,320
there's millions of papers here
of government talk to one another,

957
00:56:08,590 --> 00:56:12,340
but the ones I value the most are the
letters from the people who are telling me

958
00:56:12,341 --> 00:56:15,670
their stories and their opinions of
me and what I should do differently.

959
00:56:16,150 --> 00:56:19,510
And those are the ones that I hope
people will read as time goes by.

960
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:22,000
So maintaining that connection,

961
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:25,780
whether it's a leader and and their
company and their shareholders,

962
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:28,510
or whether it's a president
and their constituencies,

963
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:33,010
and keeping that sense of
understanding and connection directly.

964
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:38,340
That's why FDR was so terrific on the
radio because he made people feel when he

965
00:56:38,951 --> 00:56:42,450
was communicating with them that he was
talking to them individually. You know,

966
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:45,400
people would be sitting in their living
room or in their kitchen looking at the

967
00:56:45,401 --> 00:56:48,160
radio, but they felt somehow
he was just talking to them.

968
00:56:48,161 --> 00:56:51,490
There's a story about a
construction worker going home,
one nine as part. I said,

969
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:53,950
where are you going so early?
You said, well, my president,

970
00:56:54,190 --> 00:56:57,790
he's coming to speak to me in my
living room tonight. It's only right.

971
00:56:57,791 --> 00:56:59,500
I'd be there to greet him when he comes.

972
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:03,490
It's that sense of keeping that
connection. The higher up you go,

973
00:57:03,790 --> 00:57:07,480
the more likely it is to narrow
the numbers of people that you see.

974
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:12,340
And all of these people reached out
across those barriers to keep fresh.

975
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:16,360
Even when Eleanor Roosevelt came
back from her stories, um, the,

976
00:57:16,361 --> 00:57:17,950
what were the people were
feeling in the country,

977
00:57:17,951 --> 00:57:21,310
they would always have dinner the first
night. So the story would be fresh,

978
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:22,810
not repeated over time.

979
00:57:24,470 --> 00:57:29,270
You mentioned Eleanor, uh,
you also mentioned Lady
Bird Johnson. Are there any,

980
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:34,280
uh, first lady stories or attributes, uh,

981
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:38,750
that,
that you think don't get enough

982
00:57:40,410 --> 00:57:44,390
airtime or that perhaps are lesser
known that should be better now?

983
00:57:45,150 --> 00:57:45,271
Well,

984
00:57:45,271 --> 00:57:50,271
I think the important thing is that the
importance of a first lady and so far we

985
00:57:50,491 --> 00:57:52,470
have had just first ladies,
no first men.

986
00:57:52,890 --> 00:57:57,210
The importance of a first lady to the
president goes well beyond whether they

987
00:57:57,211 --> 00:58:01,800
contribute in the partnership
way that Eleanor did. I
mean, she was extraordinary.

988
00:58:01,801 --> 00:58:05,070
She's the first lady to
ever have a radio program,

989
00:58:05,071 --> 00:58:07,440
the first lady to speak
at a national convention,

990
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:11,250
the first to hold weekly press conferences
where she had a rule that only female

991
00:58:11,251 --> 00:58:14,710
reporters could come to her press
conferences so that all over the country,

992
00:58:14,711 --> 00:58:18,060
stuffy publishers have to hire their
first female reporter to go to Eleanor,

993
00:58:18,061 --> 00:58:18,990
those press conferences,

994
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:23,970
but they all can't be as active in
politics as Eleanor was. In fact,

995
00:58:23,971 --> 00:58:26,160
when bess Truman came in,
Eleanor said,

996
00:58:26,161 --> 00:58:29,130
I'll introduce you to the ladies
of the press and Best Truman said,

997
00:58:29,131 --> 00:58:30,780
why in the world I want to do that?

998
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:32,670
I'm not going to be talking
to the ladies of the press.

999
00:58:33,030 --> 00:58:37,230
What you need to know is the same thing
you need to know about any partnership

1000
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:40,410
is what are they contributing
to? One another. Um,

1001
00:58:40,470 --> 00:58:44,040
Teddy Roosevelt's wife Eden had no
interest in being a public figure.

1002
00:58:44,250 --> 00:58:47,790
She said the only time a woman's name
should be in the press is when she is born

1003
00:58:47,791 --> 00:58:52,080
in when she dies.
But she gave him the stability of a,

1004
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:56,160
his family home.
Then the kids were part of his life.

1005
00:58:56,161 --> 00:58:58,040
He'd come home and play with the kids.
He knew that,

1006
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:02,220
that they had a family that was strong
and stable and could withstand any of the

1007
00:59:02,221 --> 00:59:07,170
pressures of public life. So I think we
need to look at the, the way in which, um,

1008
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,930
the wives and first ladies have
contributed to their husbands.

1009
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:13,290
That may be very different, some
political, it could be a balance.

1010
00:59:13,290 --> 00:59:17,610
As lady bird was an extraordinary balance
to Lyndon Johnson. There were times,

1011
00:59:17,611 --> 00:59:18,990
even when I was at the ranch,

1012
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:23,570
or I could see him get so angry about and
controlling anger is such an important

1013
00:59:23,571 --> 00:59:27,200
part of leadership.
And somehow as he was yelling at somebody,

1014
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:31,040
she could just put her hand on his
knee and say, now, Linden, Linden,

1015
00:59:31,041 --> 00:59:33,920
you don't really mean that. You're
going to feel bad about this later on.

1016
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:36,320
And somehow it just calmed him down.

1017
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:40,550
So I think sometimes it's somebody
who's calm against the manic person.

1018
00:59:40,730 --> 00:59:44,690
Sometime it's somebody like Eleanor
who could actually argue with him.

1019
00:59:44,691 --> 00:59:47,420
And he said she was like a welcome,
a thorn in his side.

1020
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:50,570
She was the person who could tell him
the truth whenever he needed to hear it.

1021
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:57,030
Are there any other presidents that
could be someone you have written about?

1022
00:59:57,031 --> 01:00:00,360
Could be someone else you've studied.
It doesn't even have to be a president,

1023
01:00:00,361 --> 01:00:02,570
a leader, let's just say, uh,

1024
01:00:02,610 --> 01:00:07,610
who strikes you as particularly underrated
or overlooked and it doesn't have to

1025
01:00:08,131 --> 01:00:09,870
be one. Could be,
couldn't be more than one.

1026
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:14,150
Well, you know, the, there's,
there's leaders that I don't
know about that. I mean,

1027
01:00:14,151 --> 01:00:14,990
that's what's amazing.

1028
01:00:14,991 --> 01:00:18,080
Even though I taught a course on
the presidency for years at Harvard,

1029
01:00:18,590 --> 01:00:20,960
I don't really know a lot
of our presidents. In fact,

1030
01:00:20,961 --> 01:00:25,961
right now I'm involved in a possibility
of a miniseries on George Washington and

1031
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:29,540
I can't tell you how little I
know about George Washington,

1032
01:00:29,541 --> 01:00:30,830
which is really embarrassing,

1033
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:34,190
but I'm so excited because now
I'll be able to live with him.

1034
01:00:34,191 --> 01:00:35,990
I'll wake up with them in the
morning and think about him.

1035
01:00:36,220 --> 01:00:38,960
I'm not writing about it. And it will
be quite as intense as it would be,

1036
01:00:38,961 --> 01:00:41,990
but helping us a consultant
on this documentary.

1037
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:45,380
So I don't think he's underrated though.
I think people know about him,

1038
01:00:45,710 --> 01:00:50,080
but I'm sure if I were to go into
somebody like Cleveland, maybe, um,

1039
01:00:50,210 --> 01:00:52,760
Grover Cleveland,
if I went into James Polk,

1040
01:00:52,790 --> 01:00:55,730
which everybody who knows him says
now he's a really interesting guy,

1041
01:00:56,060 --> 01:00:58,040
you'd find more about it.
That's the thing.

1042
01:00:58,430 --> 01:01:01,310
When you study somebody
you get interested in, um,

1043
01:01:01,670 --> 01:01:04,030
and the fact that they
reached the presidency,

1044
01:01:04,031 --> 01:01:06,410
they usually means that
there's some ambition there.

1045
01:01:06,710 --> 01:01:11,270
There's some desire hopefully to,
to do something for the country.

1046
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:14,180
There's some resilience because
they've all been through something.

1047
01:01:14,390 --> 01:01:16,280
So they become human beings.

1048
01:01:16,281 --> 01:01:20,030
And then you realize that maybe they're
underrated as a person because of their

1049
01:01:20,031 --> 01:01:21,020
judgment in history.

1050
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:24,890
The way presidential historians
judge people can often be difficult.

1051
01:01:24,891 --> 01:01:29,891
I remember I happened to be at a
dinner at the White House in 1997,

1052
01:01:31,101 --> 01:01:33,800
so it was before Monica
Lewinsky happened to Clinton,

1053
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:38,000
but there had been a
presidential historians poll
that came out that day that

1054
01:01:38,001 --> 01:01:41,540
ranked him sort of in the middle,
and he was so angry through the dinner.

1055
01:01:41,541 --> 01:01:42,920
He just kept talking about it.
I hung,

1056
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:45,470
fortunately was sitting next to
him as a presidential historian.

1057
01:01:45,830 --> 01:01:48,890
So I was trying to make him
feel better that very day.

1058
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:51,740
The owners of the Brooklyn Dodgers,
now,

1059
01:01:51,741 --> 01:01:54,770
the Los Angeles Dodgers had announced
that they were selling the team and there

1060
01:01:54,771 --> 01:01:59,060
was some thought that maybe they'd
come back to Brooklyn. So I said to,

1061
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:00,170
I said to President Clinton,

1062
01:02:00,171 --> 01:02:03,800
I'd make you a corrupt bargain if you
bring the Dodgers back to Brooklyn.

1063
01:02:04,010 --> 01:02:06,490
I will put you up a notch on
the next presidential poll.

1064
01:02:07,530 --> 01:02:10,330
You can even really laugh.
I didn't think he thought it was funny,

1065
01:02:10,340 --> 01:02:13,400
but I thought it was funny.
Anyway, um, you know,

1066
01:02:13,401 --> 01:02:17,630
just mentioning that business though
of Lyndon Johnson and having anger,

1067
01:02:17,930 --> 01:02:22,620
controlling anger is such an
important part of leadership and both,

1068
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:25,290
some of my guys was so much
better at it than others. I mean,

1069
01:02:25,291 --> 01:02:29,370
Abraham Lincoln had this wonderful
ritual that I think you can develop where

1070
01:02:29,371 --> 01:02:33,730
when he got angry with somebody, he would
write what he called a hot letter, um,

1071
01:02:33,990 --> 01:02:35,790
to the person releasing all this anger.

1072
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:39,480
And then he put the letter aside hoping
he would cool down psychologically and

1073
01:02:39,481 --> 01:02:40,440
never need to send it.

1074
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:43,970
The famous case of that is when general
Meade failed to follow up with General

1075
01:02:43,971 --> 01:02:47,160
Lee's army after the victory had
Gettysburg despite telegrams saying,

1076
01:02:47,161 --> 01:02:49,560
you can't let these Lee's army escape.
Um,

1077
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:52,810
he did let Lee's army is
escape and Joe and, and,

1078
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:56,700
and Lincoln was so upset about it.
Then he wrote a long letter saying,

1079
01:02:56,701 --> 01:02:59,220
I'm in measurably distressed or
didn't do what we asked you to do,

1080
01:02:59,221 --> 01:03:03,420
had you done so the war would have come
to an earlier end. But then he realized,

1081
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:05,820
oh my God, he's still in the
field. This will paralyze him.

1082
01:03:06,090 --> 01:03:10,530
He puts the letter aside and it's never
even seen until the 20th century when

1083
01:03:10,531 --> 01:03:13,890
his papers are open. And a raft
of these kinds of letters exist,

1084
01:03:13,891 --> 01:03:18,780
never sent and never signed. So after the
book, team of rivals came out, um, uh,

1085
01:03:18,810 --> 01:03:22,190
CEO wrote me and he said,
thank God for Lincoln's hot letters.

1086
01:03:22,230 --> 01:03:26,160
He had written an email to a subordinate
thinking that the subordinate had done

1087
01:03:26,161 --> 01:03:27,900
something wrong.
And then he decided,

1088
01:03:27,930 --> 01:03:31,320
I think I'll just put this in
draft instead of sending it.

1089
01:03:31,530 --> 01:03:34,500
And he found out the next day that he
had been wrong about the information.

1090
01:03:34,650 --> 01:03:38,910
So that's one way to get through
with anger. FDR had his own way.

1091
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:41,160
He would write drafts of speeches,

1092
01:03:41,161 --> 01:03:45,240
say his fireside chats would go through
five or six drafts before they would be

1093
01:03:45,241 --> 01:03:49,440
done. And if he was angry at a
congressman over a particular incident,

1094
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:52,830
he would call out the person by
name. And the first draft, you know,

1095
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:55,440
we'd call him a traitor to his class,
a terrible guy.

1096
01:03:55,860 --> 01:03:57,780
I knew young speechwriter
came along and said,

1097
01:03:57,810 --> 01:04:01,230
I can't believe he's going
to do this. This will look
terrible. The oldest speech,

1098
01:04:01,231 --> 01:04:04,230
right? He said, just wait until the
second draft. By the second draft,

1099
01:04:04,231 --> 01:04:06,200
the congressman's name
was gone by the third,

1100
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:09,870
the negative adjectives were gone by the
final draft. All was sweetness in life,

1101
01:04:10,050 --> 01:04:12,480
but he'd gotten it all out
of his system by doing that.

1102
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:17,340
So figuring out ways to get that anger
out in a way that's not going to hurt the

1103
01:04:17,341 --> 01:04:21,300
person directly and hurt your
own leadership is something
that my guys were able

1104
01:04:21,301 --> 01:04:25,860
to do. Lyndon Johnson less able
to, um, when he'd be angry,
he would go, for example,

1105
01:04:25,861 --> 01:04:29,820
to somebody's desk. And if the desk
was cleaning, think, oh my God,

1106
01:04:29,821 --> 01:04:34,810
the guy's not working hard. If it was
messy and think he's disorganized. And,

1107
01:04:34,870 --> 01:04:36,180
and then when he got angry,

1108
01:04:36,181 --> 01:04:39,300
he would just start yelling at the person
right there and then he'd feel bad.

1109
01:04:39,570 --> 01:04:42,600
And he might send, you know, a
present to them the next day,

1110
01:04:42,870 --> 01:04:45,990
but so much better if you can release
that anger in a different way.

1111
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:49,170
Stanton Lincoln's war secretary,
um,

1112
01:04:49,230 --> 01:04:53,730
came by one day and he was furious at a
general. And so Lincoln said to him, well,

1113
01:04:53,731 --> 01:04:57,280
why don't you write to the general and
tell him what you're feeling? And so stat,

1114
01:04:57,281 --> 01:05:01,800
and comes back a few days
later and he reads them the
thing, and, and, and he says,

1115
01:05:01,801 --> 01:05:03,780
now, Stanton, what are you going
to do about? And he said, well,

1116
01:05:03,781 --> 01:05:06,570
I'm going to send it, of course.
And Lincoln said, no, you're not.

1117
01:05:06,571 --> 01:05:08,670
Just throw it in the wastepaper basket.
And he said,

1118
01:05:08,671 --> 01:05:10,860
but it took me two days to
write. And he said, I know.

1119
01:05:10,861 --> 01:05:13,170
And it did you ever so much good.
You feel better now?

1120
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:15,480
That's all that's necessary.
Just throw it away.

1121
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:18,400
And so after a little more
grumbling stand did just that.

1122
01:05:18,940 --> 01:05:20,350
And the interesting thing is when I,

1123
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:24,820
when I interviewed President Obama
for a Vanity Fair exit interview,

1124
01:05:25,540 --> 01:05:27,970
I was talking to him about
Lincoln's hot letters and,

1125
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:32,770
and he had read team of rivals, but we,
we re we went over it again and I said,

1126
01:05:32,771 --> 01:05:35,620
do you ever do that? And you said, what
do you mean? Of course I do all the time.

1127
01:05:35,621 --> 01:05:36,910
I said, what do you mean? He said,

1128
01:05:36,911 --> 01:05:39,960
I write dozens of letters and promote
them up and put it in the wastebasket.

1129
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:42,100
So that's a lesson one could learn

1130
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:46,760
pulling from that vanity fair piece.

1131
01:05:46,850 --> 01:05:49,520
I wanted to ask you about
this because at one point,

1132
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:53,330
but I think I have this right.
You, you wrote at the beginning,

1133
01:05:53,390 --> 01:05:54,860
you've prepared for
this conversation today.

1134
01:05:54,861 --> 01:05:58,550
I realized that it was nine years ago
that you first called me on my cell phone

1135
01:05:58,551 --> 01:06:00,380
quote. Hello, this is Barack Obama.

1136
01:06:00,410 --> 01:06:03,020
I've just read team of rivals and
we have to talk about Lincoln.

1137
01:06:03,021 --> 01:06:06,800
So a couple of questions.
Did you know this call was coming?

1138
01:06:06,801 --> 01:06:11,801
Was it a blocked number and then
someone saying they're Barack Obama?

1139
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:13,930
Did,
do you believe that it was a Brockville?

1140
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:16,670
Like could you tell us a little
bit about that phone call?

1141
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:19,830
No, remember he's just a
candidate at this point.

1142
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:22,440
We're running way behind Hillary Clinton,

1143
01:06:22,710 --> 01:06:27,120
but obviously he had been a star at
that convention, so I had never met him.

1144
01:06:27,121 --> 01:06:29,820
But I'd heard him give that speech
because I'd been there covering it for

1145
01:06:29,821 --> 01:06:33,770
television. But no, I didn't
picture the room I was in,

1146
01:06:33,771 --> 01:06:37,590
in my house when I just answered
the cell phone and he said,

1147
01:06:37,591 --> 01:06:41,310
this is Barack Obama. And I thought at
first I didn't really, but indeed it was.

1148
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:45,060
And what had happened is that he
wanted to talk to me about the book,

1149
01:06:45,061 --> 01:06:47,730
not because he was thinking
of creating a team of rivals.

1150
01:06:47,731 --> 01:06:49,590
He was so far behind
Hillary at that point.

1151
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:53,070
He just was fascinated by Lincoln's
emotional intelligence. You know,

1152
01:06:53,071 --> 01:06:57,020
how he could forgive these people in the
past, how he could control his anger,

1153
01:06:57,030 --> 01:06:59,310
how he could share credit,
all those things.

1154
01:06:59,310 --> 01:07:02,610
So I went to his Senate office building
and talk to them about Lincoln.

1155
01:07:03,150 --> 01:07:08,070
And then the interesting thing that
happened is that when he then appointed

1156
01:07:08,071 --> 01:07:12,330
Hillary, secretary of state, his chief
rival, after he had won the nomination,

1157
01:07:12,331 --> 01:07:14,850
actually somebody asked him,
a journalist said to him,

1158
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:18,720
would you really be willing to put one
of your chief rivals into your cabinet?

1159
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:22,590
Even if he or she had a spouse
who could be a pain in the neck?

1160
01:07:22,950 --> 01:07:25,650
Of course it was meaning
Hillary and Bill Clinton.

1161
01:07:25,950 --> 01:07:29,880
And he then quoted Lincoln
and he said, you know, the
times are in peril. You know,

1162
01:07:29,940 --> 01:07:32,490
these are the strongest smells
people. If she's the strongest, yes,

1163
01:07:32,491 --> 01:07:37,140
I'll put her in. So then when he did,
it sort of became a term team of rivals.

1164
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:41,280
So when I went to the inauguration,
covering it for television,

1165
01:07:41,281 --> 01:07:44,970
and there was a party the night before
where Hillary Clinton was and teasingly,

1166
01:07:44,971 --> 01:07:48,540
she came up to me and said,
you are responsible for my
being secretary of state.

1167
01:07:48,870 --> 01:07:51,450
Of course, not me, but
Abraham Lincoln. But yes,

1168
01:07:51,460 --> 01:07:53,520
I think leaders do learn from each other.

1169
01:07:53,521 --> 01:07:56,820
That's one of the great things about
Harry Truman was that even though he was

1170
01:07:56,821 --> 01:07:57,960
not college educated,

1171
01:07:58,140 --> 01:08:02,130
he loved reading history and biography
and he learned from the leaders in the

1172
01:08:02,131 --> 01:08:05,490
past. I mean, each one of them
I think learns from each other.

1173
01:08:05,491 --> 01:08:06,570
I mean when I think about it,

1174
01:08:06,780 --> 01:08:11,340
the book that I've written about
Lincoln and teddy and Franklin and Lbj,

1175
01:08:11,341 --> 01:08:15,800
it's almost like a family tree
because Lbj, his hero was Roosevelt,

1176
01:08:15,801 --> 01:08:17,300
who he called his political daddy.

1177
01:08:17,750 --> 01:08:21,440
Franklin Roosevelt's hero was Teddy
Roosevelt that he modeled his whole career

1178
01:08:21,441 --> 01:08:25,370
on him when, when Franklin was 28
years old and a law clerk, as I say,

1179
01:08:25,371 --> 01:08:27,830
not having been a great student
or even a great Locklear,

1180
01:08:28,130 --> 01:08:31,250
he and the law clerks are sitting around
and talking about what might happen to

1181
01:08:31,251 --> 01:08:34,520
them in the future and he said, I'm
not going to be practicing law forever.

1182
01:08:34,850 --> 01:08:38,480
I think what I'd like to do is to be a
state legislator and then I think I'd

1183
01:08:38,481 --> 01:08:41,900
love to be assistant secretary of the
navy. He loved ships and he loved maps.

1184
01:08:41,901 --> 01:08:44,900
They loved the navy. And then maybe
from that I could be governor,

1185
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:45,801
and then who knows,

1186
01:08:45,801 --> 01:08:50,300
maybe I could be president exactly the
path that Teddy Roosevelt's and taken and

1187
01:08:50,301 --> 01:08:52,700
teddy was his hero. They would
just gently related. But of course,

1188
01:08:52,701 --> 01:08:56,390
Eleanor Roosevelt was Teddy
Roosevelt's younger brother's daughter,

1189
01:08:56,420 --> 01:08:59,090
and her father had died
of alcoholism young.

1190
01:08:59,091 --> 01:09:01,290
So teddy became a really
important uncle [inaudible].

1191
01:09:01,730 --> 01:09:06,260
So from the time that Franklin was young,
meeting the family early on,

1192
01:09:06,290 --> 01:09:09,260
and then from knowing Teddy Roosevelt,
the young men, that was his hero,

1193
01:09:09,590 --> 01:09:13,730
Teddy Roosevelt's hero was Abraham
Lincoln. And he used to read,

1194
01:09:13,790 --> 01:09:17,180
he read one summer when he was in the
middle of this terrible crisis of the coal

1195
01:09:17,181 --> 01:09:22,070
strike. He read the volumes, eight
volumes by Nicola and Hay on Lincoln.

1196
01:09:22,370 --> 01:09:23,720
And it just helped him,
he said,

1197
01:09:23,721 --> 01:09:27,140
to learn that Lincoln had been through
rough times before then Lincoln had had

1198
01:09:27,141 --> 01:09:29,900
to face radicals on the one side,
conservatives on the other,

1199
01:09:29,901 --> 01:09:33,440
and figure out a moderate point of view.
And in the middle of this coal strike,

1200
01:09:33,441 --> 01:09:36,830
he's reading this book
and it gives him solace.

1201
01:09:36,890 --> 01:09:41,560
And then of course Lincoln's heroes
were the founding fathers and George

1202
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:41,570
Washington.

1203
01:09:41,570 --> 01:09:45,140
So it shows how short the history of
our country is that you could encompass

1204
01:09:45,141 --> 01:09:49,400
these four or five liters in the whole
history of the country who form a family

1205
01:09:49,401 --> 01:09:50,234
tree.

1206
01:09:50,990 --> 01:09:55,050
It's remarkable. It really is
incredible. I've been at just,

1207
01:09:55,070 --> 01:09:56,900
I think about say,

1208
01:09:57,200 --> 01:10:02,200
traveling overseas and you find these
buildings that are by not a small margin

1209
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:08,300
so much older than the entire
history of our country. It's,

1210
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:10,820
it's really remarkable. Uh, and uh,

1211
01:10:11,430 --> 01:10:16,340
I'd love to come back
to some of these habits,

1212
01:10:16,730 --> 01:10:21,540
uh, one of which we discussed the hot
letters say that Lincoln Wood, right. Uh,

1213
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:25,950
are there any other routines or habits,
uh,

1214
01:10:26,330 --> 01:10:30,500
could be for anything for forgiveness
sharing or giving credit or anything at

1215
01:10:30,501 --> 01:10:35,501
all that have stuck with you that you
find particularly interesting or unusual

1216
01:10:36,381 --> 01:10:38,960
from any of the figures you've studied?

1217
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:40,350
Well, I think, you know,

1218
01:10:40,350 --> 01:10:44,430
one of the things that teddy rose about
would argue was that procrastination was

1219
01:10:44,431 --> 01:10:49,320
a mortal sin, so that if he knew he
had to give a speech months away,

1220
01:10:49,590 --> 01:10:51,600
he would start writing it that day.

1221
01:10:51,870 --> 01:10:54,870
Just so that he wouldn't have to think
about when am I going to start it?

1222
01:10:54,871 --> 01:10:57,840
When am I going to start it?
Even when he was leaving the presidency,

1223
01:10:57,841 --> 01:11:02,160
he was supposed to give a speech in the
Sorbonne after his year in Africa on the

1224
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:06,060
hunt. Then he went on, but he had already
finished the speech before he went,

1225
01:11:06,090 --> 01:11:09,810
even on the hunt to Africa.
And so there's so many times,

1226
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:12,960
even for myself, if I have
something I really don't want to do,

1227
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:16,860
I at least started so that I won't have
to think what am I going to start that

1228
01:11:16,861 --> 01:11:17,580
thing?

1229
01:11:17,580 --> 01:11:21,570
So that's a habit that I
think he developed in his
other people in the cabinet

1230
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:24,030
whenever they had to give
a speech or go somewhere,

1231
01:11:24,090 --> 01:11:27,210
they would all be preparing ahead of
time and sharing drafts with one another,

1232
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:30,590
which they wouldn't have done if it
had waited til the last moment. Um,

1233
01:11:30,690 --> 01:11:32,580
I think the most important thing,
however,

1234
01:11:32,581 --> 01:11:37,290
that they all figured out how to do
was how to relax and replenish their

1235
01:11:37,291 --> 01:11:40,260
energies to find time to think and relax.
You know,

1236
01:11:40,261 --> 01:11:42,540
I think about it in our 24 seven worlds,

1237
01:11:42,541 --> 01:11:47,280
so many leaders or even regular people
working in an organization feel I can't

1238
01:11:47,281 --> 01:11:50,910
take a vacation or I have to take
my email with me wherever I go.

1239
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:54,000
I can't find time to do
anything else other than work.

1240
01:11:54,330 --> 01:11:56,490
But think of these guys that I'm studying.

1241
01:11:56,730 --> 01:11:58,950
They certainly had difficult situations.

1242
01:11:59,130 --> 01:12:01,260
You had Lincoln having to
deal with the civil war.

1243
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:05,490
You have teddy dealing with the industrial
revolution and the huge gap between

1244
01:12:05,491 --> 01:12:08,610
rich and poor that arises during
that time and big labor strife.

1245
01:12:08,910 --> 01:12:13,260
And you have obviously FDR with the
depression and World War II and Lyndon

1246
01:12:13,260 --> 01:12:16,080
Johnson with the civil rights
struggle and here they go.

1247
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:20,190
Lincoln goes to the theater more than a
hundred times during the civil war and

1248
01:12:20,191 --> 01:12:22,290
people criticized him for it.
They said,

1249
01:12:22,291 --> 01:12:24,720
how can you go to the theater in
the midst of all this? And he said,

1250
01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:28,950
I've got to get out of politics and out
of the war and for a few hours when I'm

1251
01:12:28,951 --> 01:12:30,120
watching Henry the fourth,

1252
01:12:30,420 --> 01:12:34,620
I could imagine myself back at the war
of the roses and I must have some relief

1253
01:12:34,621 --> 01:12:38,820
from this terrible anxiety. It will kill
me. And the theater is in or for Lincoln.

1254
01:12:38,821 --> 01:12:40,200
When he told funny stories,

1255
01:12:40,201 --> 01:12:44,370
he was a great storyteller and he could
tell stories to people who are around

1256
01:12:44,371 --> 01:12:46,620
him and they'd laugh
and when he would laugh,

1257
01:12:46,830 --> 01:12:48,960
somehow he was whistling off his sadness.

1258
01:12:48,961 --> 01:12:53,130
So humor in a certain sense was
his way of dealing with anxiety.

1259
01:12:53,550 --> 01:12:56,670
Teddy Roosevelt,
every afternoon found at time,

1260
01:12:56,700 --> 01:13:01,700
two hours every afternoon for either a
rock is tennis match or a a strenuous

1261
01:13:02,371 --> 01:13:04,560
hike and the wooded
cliffs of Rock Creek Park,

1262
01:13:04,890 --> 01:13:08,580
or being thrown around by two
Japanese wrestlers or a boxing match.

1263
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:11,730
He loved playing this
game of single stock.

1264
01:13:11,731 --> 01:13:14,820
He would often injure himself and
these various games he played.

1265
01:13:15,180 --> 01:13:17,850
And then there was one time when he was
in the middle of the coal strike where

1266
01:13:17,851 --> 01:13:21,420
he was deprived of these any exertions
because he had an infected leg.

1267
01:13:21,690 --> 01:13:24,990
So he writes to the Librarian
of Congress and he said,

1268
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:27,210
I need some escape from all this.

1269
01:13:27,390 --> 01:13:31,140
I want you to send me something on
Mediterranean history or something on the

1270
01:13:31,141 --> 01:13:35,490
history of Poland. And so in the middle
of this coal strike at night, he says,

1271
01:13:35,610 --> 01:13:37,860
and he writes back to the
Librarian of Congress and he said,

1272
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:40,380
it's been such a delight
to drop everything useful,

1273
01:13:40,381 --> 01:13:41,670
everything relating to my duty,

1274
01:13:41,671 --> 01:13:45,360
particularly the coals drag and spend
an afternoon reading about the relations

1275
01:13:45,361 --> 01:13:49,080
between the Syria and Egypt,
which could not possibly do me any good,

1276
01:13:49,081 --> 01:13:53,640
but in which I reveled accordingly,
Franklin is the best.

1277
01:13:53,670 --> 01:13:56,730
I think in some ways he's the best.
So first of all,

1278
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:00,720
he loves going to having movies at the
White House. He loves crossword puzzles,

1279
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:05,550
he loves his stamps, he loves looking
at maps. He loved playing poker.

1280
01:14:05,790 --> 01:14:07,560
He really,
really knew how to relax.

1281
01:14:07,561 --> 01:14:10,980
But the best thing he did was
when he was in World War II.

1282
01:14:11,170 --> 01:14:12,970
He had a cocktail hour every night.

1283
01:14:13,270 --> 01:14:16,030
And the rule was that you
couldn't talk about the war.

1284
01:14:16,270 --> 01:14:18,610
You could talk about books you read,
you can talk about movies,

1285
01:14:18,611 --> 01:14:22,450
you'd seen gossip about people as
long as the war wasn't mentioned.

1286
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:24,010
So for a few precious hours,

1287
01:14:24,011 --> 01:14:27,310
he liked Lincoln when Lincoln was
at the theater could relax totally.

1288
01:14:27,580 --> 01:14:28,301
And after a while,

1289
01:14:28,301 --> 01:14:32,320
this cocktail hour was so important to
him that he wanted his closest friends

1290
01:14:32,321 --> 01:14:35,230
and associates to be living on the second
floor of the White House to be ready

1291
01:14:35,231 --> 01:14:36,220
for the cocktail hour.

1292
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:39,640
So the White House became the most
exclusive residential hotel you could

1293
01:14:39,641 --> 01:14:42,940
possibly imagine. Harry Hopkins,
his foreign policy advisor,

1294
01:14:42,941 --> 01:14:46,840
came for dinner one night, slept over,
didn't leave until the war came to an end.

1295
01:14:47,110 --> 01:14:50,050
His secretary missing my hand,
lived with a family in the White House.

1296
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:53,170
I'm Lorena Hickok, who had an
emotional relationship with Eleanor,

1297
01:14:53,171 --> 01:14:57,160
had a bedroom next to Eleanor and the
princess from Norway and Xcel and America

1298
01:14:57,161 --> 01:15:00,490
during the war and lived with the family
on the weekends. And the great wisdom.

1299
01:15:00,491 --> 01:15:03,940
Churchill came and spent weeks at a
time and a room diagonally across from

1300
01:15:03,941 --> 01:15:06,370
Roosevelt's.
So when I was writing the book,

1301
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:10,600
I just imagine all these people in their
bathrobes at night on the corridor of

1302
01:15:10,601 --> 01:15:14,800
the second floor of the
White House waiting for the
cocktail hour or having come

1303
01:15:14,801 --> 01:15:17,730
from the cocktail hour and
then being ready for bed and,

1304
01:15:17,780 --> 01:15:21,460
and wishing that when I've been up there
with Lyndon Johnson when I was 24 I'd

1305
01:15:21,461 --> 01:15:24,390
asked where did Roosevelt sleep? Where
was Eleanor, where was Churchill?

1306
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:26,170
But I wasn't thinking in those terms then.

1307
01:15:26,470 --> 01:15:30,940
So I happened to mention this on a radio
program in Washington when no ordinary

1308
01:15:30,970 --> 01:15:32,800
time came out and it happened.

1309
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:34,720
Hillary Clinton then in the
White House was listening,

1310
01:15:34,990 --> 01:15:36,980
so she promptly called me
up at the radio station,

1311
01:15:36,981 --> 01:15:39,970
invited me to sleep overnight in the
White House so I could wander the Carter

1312
01:15:39,971 --> 01:15:43,270
together with her and their husband and
figure out where everyone had slept 50

1313
01:15:43,271 --> 01:15:44,104
years earlier.

1314
01:15:45,070 --> 01:15:49,300
She invited me and my husband to sleep
overnight and we were given Winston

1315
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:51,250
Churchill's room, which meant
there was no way I could sleep.

1316
01:15:51,490 --> 01:15:54,430
I was certain he was sitting in the
corner drinking his brandy and smoking his

1317
01:15:54,431 --> 01:15:57,370
cigar. That my map we figured out, yes,

1318
01:15:57,790 --> 01:16:01,240
Chelsea cleanses sleeping where Harry
Hopkins was and the Clintons are sleeping

1319
01:16:01,241 --> 01:16:04,120
where FDR was and of course we
were with Winston Churchill.

1320
01:16:04,270 --> 01:16:05,410
So it was pretty exciting.
Yeah,

1321
01:16:05,980 --> 01:16:07,300
that is amazing.

1322
01:16:07,990 --> 01:16:11,530
Are there any particular routines,
tools,

1323
01:16:11,531 --> 01:16:16,531
anything that you use to
rejuvenate or decompress yourself?

1324
01:16:17,390 --> 01:16:22,390
You have an incredibly busy schedule
or you certainly it just based on the

1325
01:16:23,741 --> 01:16:25,360
amount of work you put out it would,

1326
01:16:25,361 --> 01:16:29,020
it would seem that you are
certainly able to go, go, go.

1327
01:16:29,021 --> 01:16:33,790
So what have you built into your
schedule to help recharge the batteries?

1328
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:39,630
Well, the most important thing I think
is that once it's time for dinner,

1329
01:16:39,660 --> 01:16:43,410
I don't work late into the nights I work.
I get up early in the morning,

1330
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:46,850
I can wake up at five or five 30 I
love getting up before everybody else.

1331
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:51,920
He is around and I don't look at email
until seven or seven 30 if it's winter,

1332
01:16:52,710 --> 01:16:56,610
I come downstairs and I have a fire
that I can turn on the fireplace.

1333
01:16:56,940 --> 01:16:58,770
If it's summer and it's air conditioned,

1334
01:16:58,771 --> 01:17:02,790
I put a blanket on myself and the rest
of the household hasn't awakened yet.

1335
01:17:02,791 --> 01:17:07,290
So those are really precious hours to to
just read over what I'd written the day

1336
01:17:07,290 --> 01:17:08,160
before and not looking at email,

1337
01:17:08,161 --> 01:17:11,420
not think of everything else I
have to do that day. And similarly,

1338
01:17:11,421 --> 01:17:15,800
by six 30 or so at night,
that's the end of work. Um, I,

1339
01:17:16,070 --> 01:17:18,190
we go out to dinner every
night as I was saying,

1340
01:17:18,191 --> 01:17:20,780
and when I get to that
bar with my friends,

1341
01:17:21,110 --> 01:17:23,660
it has nothing to do with
what I was doing that day.

1342
01:17:23,660 --> 01:17:27,260
We're talking about the game of the red
sox and we were talking about politics

1343
01:17:27,590 --> 01:17:30,380
and it's totally taking me away
to another channel of that.

1344
01:17:30,890 --> 01:17:35,840
And then because we've had season tickets
for the red sox for the last 30 years,

1345
01:17:36,170 --> 01:17:37,970
when I walk into the baseball game,

1346
01:17:37,971 --> 01:17:41,450
I obviously became a red sox fan after
the Brooklyn Dodgers abandoned me and

1347
01:17:41,451 --> 01:17:45,650
went to Los Angeles and I moved to Harvard
and became a red sox fan equally as

1348
01:17:45,651 --> 01:17:47,720
crazy as I was as a Brooklyn dodger fan.

1349
01:17:48,020 --> 01:17:52,130
But once I walked into that ballpark and
I keep score still and when I can there,

1350
01:17:52,550 --> 01:17:56,420
um, I feel like I'm in another place and
I don't think and worry about what I'm

1351
01:17:56,421 --> 01:17:59,090
doing.
And then when I get home at night,

1352
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:03,260
I don't read history at night.
I read mysteries somehow.

1353
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:06,950
That's what I need to do before going
to sleep is to read some mystery.

1354
01:18:06,950 --> 01:18:09,440
I don't know why I tried to put
the pieces of the puzzle together,

1355
01:18:09,740 --> 01:18:14,300
but just relaxing with a good mystery.
So there are ways to do it. I think,

1356
01:18:14,301 --> 01:18:15,290
I mean the,

1357
01:18:15,330 --> 01:18:20,330
the most interesting way of thinking
about anxiety from my guys is Fdr had all

1358
01:18:20,940 --> 01:18:24,170
these ways of allowing himself to relax.

1359
01:18:24,171 --> 01:18:27,920
He went on a fishing trip at one point
10 day fishing trip in the middle of the

1360
01:18:27,921 --> 01:18:30,320
crisis of Britain before
we were in the war.

1361
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:34,550
And he came up with the whole idea of
lend lease on that fishing trip because he

1362
01:18:34,551 --> 01:18:37,700
was away from the terminal of Washington
where the bureaucratic structure

1363
01:18:37,701 --> 01:18:41,720
couldn't figure out how to lend money
or lend supplies to England because of

1364
01:18:41,721 --> 01:18:44,000
neutrality acts.
And so he comes up with lend lease.

1365
01:18:44,510 --> 01:18:48,600
I'm going with that is I'm going to
yes. I don't know what that is. No,

1366
01:18:48,620 --> 01:18:52,400
I absolutely.
So what happens is that when Britain has,

1367
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:57,200
is already being bombed by
Germany and it's 1940, so it's,

1368
01:18:57,201 --> 01:18:59,340
we're not in the war yet. Um, he,

1369
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:02,300
he knows that Churchill
has run out of supplies.

1370
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:05,090
Dunkirk had happen so they're
destroyers were killed.

1371
01:19:05,330 --> 01:19:08,960
We need to somehow get our supplies
and our weapons to England,

1372
01:19:09,260 --> 01:19:11,510
but England has no money
to buy them anymore.

1373
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:14,540
And neutrality acts say we
can't just give them to them.

1374
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:19,750
So he comes up with the idea that we
will lend you our weapons and then after

1375
01:19:19,971 --> 01:19:23,410
the war is over, you will get
them back to us as if, uh,

1376
01:19:23,480 --> 01:19:28,250
neighbor's houses on fire and you're
going to lend them your hose to save that

1377
01:19:28,251 --> 01:19:30,650
neighbor's house,
but also save your house too.

1378
01:19:31,010 --> 01:19:34,040
And then in return for giving the weapons,

1379
01:19:34,130 --> 01:19:38,150
we got a lease on British bases all around
the world. There's really a good deal,

1380
01:19:38,151 --> 01:19:40,370
a good Yankee bargain.
But anyway,

1381
01:19:40,590 --> 01:19:44,600
it eventually gave us
money for, um, for Russia.

1382
01:19:44,630 --> 01:19:47,210
It gave us money for all of our allies,
not just money,

1383
01:19:47,211 --> 01:19:51,500
but supplies that were given to our allies
all over the world because of leasing

1384
01:19:51,501 --> 01:19:56,120
them rather than letting them buy it.
So on this 10 day fishing trip,

1385
01:19:56,510 --> 01:20:00,350
he comes up with the idea that he can
just lend the weapons and then get them

1386
01:20:00,351 --> 01:20:03,740
back at the end and it's really leasing
them rather than selling them or having

1387
01:20:03,741 --> 01:20:05,780
them buy it.
So it was a simple thing,

1388
01:20:05,781 --> 01:20:07,650
but nobody could figure
that out in Washington.

1389
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:10,740
But the thing that really
struck me was that an evening's,

1390
01:20:10,741 --> 01:20:12,810
when FDR couldn't fall asleep,

1391
01:20:12,811 --> 01:20:16,320
when there was unusual tension
and the poker game didn't do it,

1392
01:20:16,321 --> 01:20:17,850
or the cocktail hour didn't do it,

1393
01:20:18,330 --> 01:20:21,180
he had this ritual that
helped him to fall asleep.

1394
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:26,190
He would close his eyes and imagine
himself as a boy again at Hyde Park,

1395
01:20:26,550 --> 01:20:30,210
standing with his sled and top
the steep hill behind his house.

1396
01:20:30,570 --> 01:20:33,960
And he would go down the hill until he
reached the bottom and then slowly come

1397
01:20:33,961 --> 01:20:37,620
back up again to the top. And then
he'd do again, go over and over again.

1398
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:39,300
It was his method of counting sheep.

1399
01:20:39,810 --> 01:20:44,070
But the amazing thing is
he's also liberating himself
from the paralysis by this

1400
01:20:44,130 --> 01:20:47,760
imagining. And in that
way he falls asleep. So,

1401
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:52,110
and what Teddy Roosevelt would do
when he was anxious about an election,

1402
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:54,120
and this I've thought
about a lot actually,

1403
01:20:54,540 --> 01:20:57,570
he would write letters to his
friends and his family saying,

1404
01:20:57,930 --> 01:21:02,240
don't worry if I don't win this election.
I've had the, the best life so far.

1405
01:21:02,270 --> 01:21:07,130
I've had a first rate run and it would
be selfish of me to think that if I don't

1406
01:21:07,131 --> 01:21:11,210
win this one, everything is lost. And
I've thought about that a lot actually.

1407
01:21:11,211 --> 01:21:14,330
I've thought about the fact
that if I knew I were dying,

1408
01:21:14,740 --> 01:21:18,260
and maybe this is dramatic way of putting
it because he was just worried about

1409
01:21:18,261 --> 01:21:19,160
losing an election,

1410
01:21:19,550 --> 01:21:24,230
but that I'd hope that it would give me
solace to think I really had a good life

1411
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:28,250
and I felt like it was what I wanted
it to be. And I can't control that.

1412
01:21:28,251 --> 01:21:31,400
It won't go on any longer,
but I can look back on that.

1413
01:21:31,401 --> 01:21:36,020
Just like teddy looked back on his life
and I thought about it so much in these

1414
01:21:36,020 --> 01:21:40,400
last months because my husband got cancer
this last year and he was incredible

1415
01:21:40,401 --> 01:21:42,590
during the whole time.
I mean he's, he's still,

1416
01:21:42,620 --> 01:21:47,360
even though he couldn't enjoy food anymore
because of the radiation that he went

1417
01:21:47,361 --> 01:21:50,180
through, couldn't have his
trademark cigars anymore.

1418
01:21:50,420 --> 01:21:54,390
He went out every night with as
to our regular bar dinners. Um,

1419
01:21:54,470 --> 01:21:58,040
even though he was being fed by a feeding
tube during the day so that he would

1420
01:21:58,041 --> 01:22:02,300
get the nourishment he needed an I
actually learned how to you do the feeding

1421
01:22:02,301 --> 01:22:03,410
tube.
I couldn't believe that.

1422
01:22:03,411 --> 01:22:07,310
I learned that I was so afraid of my
technical abilities and I had to face that

1423
01:22:07,311 --> 01:22:10,850
fear and somehow do it.
But in the days before he died,

1424
01:22:10,970 --> 01:22:14,990
all of our friends came to visit him
because he was in hospice at home and

1425
01:22:14,991 --> 01:22:16,350
somehow magically,
he,

1426
01:22:16,380 --> 01:22:19,220
he woke up when people would come
and he had something to say to them,

1427
01:22:19,221 --> 01:22:22,100
something funny or something serious and,

1428
01:22:22,250 --> 01:22:25,270
and then he would go back to sleep
and then wake up again. But in,

1429
01:22:25,300 --> 01:22:29,990
in so many days before that he would say
he didn't necessarily know he was dying

1430
01:22:29,991 --> 01:22:30,471
right then,

1431
01:22:30,471 --> 01:22:34,190
but he knew that he had cancer and that
the radiation hadn't worked and he,

1432
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:35,910
there was no sense of talking about death.

1433
01:22:35,911 --> 01:22:39,170
He was still working on a book that he
hoped to finish, but he kept saying,

1434
01:22:39,171 --> 01:22:42,980
I love this town. I love what's happened
to our life. Our kids are great.

1435
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:46,910
How lucky we are. And I just hope I can
say that at the same way he did it made,

1436
01:22:47,420 --> 01:22:52,310
it made me less nervous about dying to
watch the peacefulness of the way he

1437
01:22:52,311 --> 01:22:54,920
handled it.
And there was an extraordinary moment.

1438
01:22:54,980 --> 01:22:56,930
I can't believe I'm only talking
about all this right now,

1439
01:22:56,931 --> 01:23:00,980
but I somehow gotten into it, um,
where the last thing he said to me,

1440
01:23:00,981 --> 01:23:03,710
he just looked at me and he had
this incredible light in his eyes.

1441
01:23:03,711 --> 01:23:08,260
Everybody said it was almost like magic.
And he just said to me, you are a wonder.

1442
01:23:08,410 --> 01:23:11,110
I mean, I will take that, those
words with me the rest of my life.

1443
01:23:11,111 --> 01:23:15,940
So I just hope I can be as peaceful and
loving as he was as he faced his own

1444
01:23:15,941 --> 01:23:16,774
death.

1445
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:19,510
Thank you so much for sharing that.

1446
01:23:19,630 --> 01:23:20,890
I don't know how I got into all that,

1447
01:23:20,891 --> 01:23:23,980
but it has something to do with anxiety
and how you got to sleep at night.

1448
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:25,620
Yeah. It's, I mean the,

1449
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:30,800
the gratitude and appreciation that
you're describing a on so many different

1450
01:23:31,201 --> 01:23:34,740
levels. But first and foremost,
I'm sorry for your loss.

1451
01:23:34,860 --> 01:23:39,300
I can't even imagine what that
would be like. Uh, but, uh,

1452
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:40,650
I thank you for sharing that.

1453
01:23:41,380 --> 01:23:42,730
No, you're welcome. He was great.

1454
01:23:42,731 --> 01:23:47,320
42 years of marriage and an
extraordinary life that he had. I mean,

1455
01:23:47,321 --> 01:23:48,460
he was,
you know,

1456
01:23:48,461 --> 01:23:52,720
he was involved in so many things that
people knew when the obituaries came out,

1457
01:23:52,721 --> 01:23:55,690
the breadth of it, people had
known part of it. I mean, we knew,

1458
01:23:55,691 --> 01:23:58,750
he wrote for Lyndon Johnson,
the great we shall overcome speech.

1459
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:01,720
He wrote Bobby Kennedy's South
Africa speech, the ripples of hope.

1460
01:24:01,990 --> 01:24:06,610
He worked with l with at JFK when he was
only in his twenties and worked on some

1461
01:24:06,611 --> 01:24:11,070
of his famous South American speeches.
Al Gore's concession speech. Um,

1462
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:13,030
but more important than any of that.

1463
01:24:13,031 --> 01:24:16,780
He was just involved in policy and in
the great society and civil rights.

1464
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:18,100
And um,

1465
01:24:18,250 --> 01:24:22,270
and then he was in the
quiz show investigation and
that was made into a movie

1466
01:24:22,271 --> 01:24:22,540
that,

1467
01:24:22,540 --> 01:24:25,360
cause he was the young guy who had
discovered that those quiz shows when you

1468
01:24:25,361 --> 01:24:28,890
weren't even born, that was
push shows were corrupted. And,

1469
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:31,270
and then he wrote a play
about Galileo and pope urban,

1470
01:24:31,271 --> 01:24:33,460
the eighth that was put on
in London and in Boston.

1471
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:38,230
It was such a such a wonderfully broad
life and he was a great guy and a great

1472
01:24:38,231 --> 01:24:40,810
husband and father to our kids.
Our kids adored him.

1473
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:42,210
I feel like

1474
01:24:45,030 --> 01:24:49,950
I'm unsure of where to go next with this.
That, that was such a beautiful story.

1475
01:24:50,230 --> 01:24:52,170
Uh,
and you're such a,

1476
01:24:52,380 --> 01:24:56,760
you're a gifted storyteller and
it seems to go back a long way.

1477
01:24:57,240 --> 01:25:01,830
You've honed that certainly
over time. And, uh,

1478
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:07,110
you have some of the most incredible,
speaking of sports storytelling,

1479
01:25:07,111 --> 01:25:12,111
some of the most incredible book blurbs
and quotes from admirers of your work

1480
01:25:12,780 --> 01:25:16,920
for this new book leadership in
turbulent times. You have Warren Buffet,

1481
01:25:16,950 --> 01:25:21,150
you have an incredible, uh, collection of,

1482
01:25:21,300 --> 01:25:22,770
of fans who have,

1483
01:25:22,830 --> 01:25:26,960
have provided you with a
words for this book. Why,

1484
01:25:26,961 --> 01:25:28,890
why did you write this book? I mean, you,

1485
01:25:28,891 --> 01:25:33,891
you have such a keen sense of the finite
amount of time that we're all given on

1486
01:25:35,701 --> 01:25:38,640
this planet. Given your study
of history, certainly mortality,

1487
01:25:38,641 --> 01:25:41,820
your firsthand exposure to it.
Why,

1488
01:25:41,940 --> 01:25:46,590
why put the time and energy
into writing this book?

1489
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:51,170
Well, you know, in some ways, I
mean, I started it five years ago,

1490
01:25:51,171 --> 01:25:54,260
so the times we're not as
turbulent as they are now,

1491
01:25:54,261 --> 01:25:58,850
but there was a sense that Washington
was broken even then and that we weren't

1492
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:02,690
kind of leadership on the two sides of
the aisle that could get anything done.

1493
01:26:03,020 --> 01:26:06,440
And having lived through the sixties
having been there when the civil rights

1494
01:26:06,470 --> 01:26:10,430
bill passed and the voting rights bill
passed and aid to education and Medicare,

1495
01:26:10,790 --> 01:26:15,410
it was such a thrilling time to be young
to see our country moving together and

1496
01:26:15,411 --> 01:26:19,010
those directions.
I'd written about these four guys before,

1497
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:23,360
but I hadn't really looked at them as
leaders and what it was that made them

1498
01:26:23,390 --> 01:26:26,690
able to not just bring two
sides of the altogether,

1499
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:29,240
but lead the country through
such difficult times.

1500
01:26:29,241 --> 01:26:33,140
And I realized that each of the Times in
which they led were far worse than the

1501
01:26:33,141 --> 01:26:36,860
time we're living in now. So that if
we think this is the worst of times,

1502
01:26:36,861 --> 01:26:39,740
history will tell you no,
we've had more turbulent times before.

1503
01:26:39,741 --> 01:26:43,430
And we got through them. When you had the
right leader fitted for the right time.

1504
01:26:43,790 --> 01:26:46,160
I mean,
they all had different leadership styles.

1505
01:26:46,161 --> 01:26:49,340
They wouldn't have been fitted to be
in the other time or possibly. So.

1506
01:26:49,670 --> 01:26:52,250
It's not just a matter of the
constellation of traits you have.

1507
01:26:52,490 --> 01:26:56,150
It's whether or not those behavioral
patterns fit the challenges of the moment

1508
01:26:56,151 --> 01:26:56,984
of the time.

1509
01:26:57,320 --> 01:27:02,320
But I think what I really wanted to do
was just to understand how they became

1510
01:27:02,361 --> 01:27:06,470
leaders. I mean, we see them as iconic
figures now there, Mount Rushmore,

1511
01:27:06,471 --> 01:27:10,970
there's monuments. And I was giving a
talk to a group of college students,

1512
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:14,180
you know, four or five years ago, and
one of them raised their hands and said,

1513
01:27:14,181 --> 01:27:17,060
but how can we, I was talking about
leadership lessons from the White House,

1514
01:27:17,300 --> 01:27:20,720
but how can I ever become one of them?
It's too far removed.

1515
01:27:20,721 --> 01:27:24,650
So the way I start the book is when each
one of them is running for office the

1516
01:27:24,651 --> 01:27:25,484
first time.

1517
01:27:25,670 --> 01:27:30,020
So they're not formed yet and they're
not going to necessarily succeed.

1518
01:27:30,410 --> 01:27:34,310
Lincoln in fact loses his first election
when he's 23 years old. But incredibly,

1519
01:27:34,311 --> 01:27:36,200
he says,
if I lose,

1520
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:40,250
I've been already to familiar with
disappointment to be very chagrined,

1521
01:27:40,580 --> 01:27:44,600
but I do promise I'll come back five or
six times and try again until it's too

1522
01:27:44,601 --> 01:27:49,180
humiliating and then I'll give up. That's
incredible. That kind of resilience. Um,

1523
01:27:49,460 --> 01:27:51,710
teddy rose,
if they all suffered adversity,

1524
01:27:51,950 --> 01:27:53,590
and I guess I was interested in that too,

1525
01:27:53,610 --> 01:27:57,830
maybe because of my personal history of
my mother dying when I was 15 my father

1526
01:27:57,831 --> 01:28:02,150
died when I was in my twenties so that
I had encountered death at an early age.

1527
01:28:02,151 --> 01:28:05,330
But all of these people went
through terrible adversity.

1528
01:28:05,330 --> 01:28:10,330
Lincoln had a near suicidal depression
when he has word was no longer his bond.

1529
01:28:10,791 --> 01:28:14,600
He had broken his engagement to marry
and he was humiliating her by doing so.

1530
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:18,080
He had failed in bringing
infrastructure projects to Illinois,

1531
01:28:18,081 --> 01:28:22,490
which he had promised to do, and he
really was almost ready. He said to die,

1532
01:28:22,491 --> 01:28:27,170
but when he was told by his best friend,
you have to rally or you will die,

1533
01:28:27,171 --> 01:28:30,680
they'd taken all knives and scissors
and razors from his room. He said,

1534
01:28:30,740 --> 01:28:32,330
I would just assume guy now,

1535
01:28:32,570 --> 01:28:35,990
but I'm not yet accomplished anything to
make any human being remembered that I

1536
01:28:35,991 --> 01:28:39,620
have lived. So that was his lodestar
that carried him through everything,

1537
01:28:39,621 --> 01:28:42,830
all the losses that he had. He
tried for the Senate twice. He lost,

1538
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:46,010
he finally wins the presidency and then
he has the civil war in front of him.

1539
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:48,440
So resilience and coming
through adversity.

1540
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:52,340
Was it a key that I wanted to understand
that all that happened to all of them.

1541
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:56,960
Teddy Roosevelt lost his wife and his
mother on the same day in the same house

1542
01:28:56,961 --> 01:29:00,110
in New York. His wife was
pregnant, having a child.

1543
01:29:00,111 --> 01:29:02,520
The mother had only 49 had
come to take care of her.

1544
01:29:02,580 --> 01:29:06,960
The mother got typhoid fever and died
and the wife died in childbirth on the

1545
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:09,870
same day and that house and he was so
depressed. He left the state legislature.

1546
01:29:09,871 --> 01:29:13,800
He went to the badlands. He said he
had to be on his horse 15 hours a day.

1547
01:29:13,801 --> 01:29:15,990
He couldn't outride black hair depression.

1548
01:29:16,410 --> 01:29:18,810
But more importantly he
found solace in nature.

1549
01:29:18,811 --> 01:29:23,430
He found solace in the west and became
a different kind of leader because he

1550
01:29:23,431 --> 01:29:25,230
understood the West as well as the east.

1551
01:29:25,680 --> 01:29:28,770
And he came back and then went on to
this extraordinary political career.

1552
01:29:28,771 --> 01:29:32,670
But it taught him, he said that you don't
build your resume. Little by little.

1553
01:29:32,671 --> 01:29:34,500
He had always thought
before he had a pattern,

1554
01:29:34,501 --> 01:29:37,320
worked out and no longer did
that pattern seems so. He said,

1555
01:29:37,321 --> 01:29:39,270
I'm just going to take whatever job comes.

1556
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:42,900
It seems really interesting to me cause
it may be my last job because he now had

1557
01:29:42,901 --> 01:29:45,240
a fatalism about life.
So his friends say,

1558
01:29:45,241 --> 01:29:47,970
why are you becoming civil
service commissioner? Why
aren't police commissioner,

1559
01:29:47,990 --> 01:29:51,930
this is below you. He said, no, I want to
do these things and if it's my last job,

1560
01:29:51,931 --> 01:29:55,410
so be it. And then of
course, most importantly FDR,

1561
01:29:55,830 --> 01:29:59,880
I mean what he went through
when he contracted polio
and was paralyzed from the

1562
01:29:59,881 --> 01:30:04,470
waist down, it allowed him
to emerge more warm hearted,

1563
01:30:04,740 --> 01:30:08,950
more connected to other people to whom
faded Delta and unkind hand than he would

1564
01:30:08,951 --> 01:30:11,700
have been before that, you
know, he said, if you spend,

1565
01:30:11,701 --> 01:30:15,450
you learn humility through something like
the polio and the paralysis. He said,

1566
01:30:15,451 --> 01:30:18,720
if you spent two years
trying to move your big toe,

1567
01:30:19,170 --> 01:30:21,930
which is frozen and you finally
move it and you celebrate it,

1568
01:30:22,050 --> 01:30:25,180
then the pressures of the presidency,
I'm not going to get to um,

1569
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:29,640
what he did at warm springs by bringing
his fellow polios as he called them to

1570
01:30:29,641 --> 01:30:33,330
enjoy life again, not just to rehab
themselves in the warm springs pool,

1571
01:30:33,690 --> 01:30:38,500
but he would have wheelchair dances.
They'd play games and the soccer games or,

1572
01:30:38,540 --> 01:30:43,140
or badminton games in the pool.
He made them learn to live life again,

1573
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:46,110
even with the affliction
of having been paralyzed.

1574
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:49,890
And he emerged a different person. I
mean, it's extraordinary what he did.

1575
01:30:49,891 --> 01:30:51,840
I and I just find a human level.

1576
01:30:52,110 --> 01:30:55,870
I found these stories so
important to understand, um,

1577
01:30:56,160 --> 01:31:00,450
much less because it made them great
leaders. I mean, when he first made a,

1578
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:03,870
an appearance after his polio,
two years afterwards,

1579
01:31:03,871 --> 01:31:05,130
he hadn't been in public life.

1580
01:31:05,130 --> 01:31:10,130
He was asked to give a nominating speech
or AO Smith for President in 1924 at

1581
01:31:10,651 --> 01:31:11,820
the Democratic convention.

1582
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:16,380
And he was very worried about how he
could get from the seat with his braces

1583
01:31:16,381 --> 01:31:17,310
locked in place.

1584
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:21,960
He could make appear to be walking if he
held onto the arm of somebody, his son,

1585
01:31:21,990 --> 01:31:23,940
strong arm,
get to the podium.

1586
01:31:23,941 --> 01:31:28,941
But he practiced and practice
that distance in his own
library time after time

1587
01:31:29,821 --> 01:31:32,340
and he was sweating and he got
up to the podium and he made it.

1588
01:31:32,850 --> 01:31:36,360
And he would practice even
when he couldn't walk at all.

1589
01:31:36,540 --> 01:31:39,810
He would practice crawling up
the stairs one stair at a time.

1590
01:31:39,811 --> 01:31:42,390
And each stair when he got hired,
they'd have a celebration.

1591
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:45,960
When you go through that adversity or
a different person at the other end,

1592
01:31:46,410 --> 01:31:50,120
and Lyndon Johnson,
what happened to him was that he had,

1593
01:31:50,440 --> 01:31:55,440
he had a loss in a Senate race in 1941
and for him it was as big an adversity or

1594
01:31:56,020 --> 01:31:57,720
these other things where
because it meant the end,

1595
01:31:57,721 --> 01:32:01,900
he thought of his political upward climb
and sometimes people don't get through

1596
01:32:01,901 --> 01:32:03,190
adversity in a positive way.

1597
01:32:03,190 --> 01:32:08,190
They can go backward and he then just
accumulated wealth and power and was not

1598
01:32:08,201 --> 01:32:11,410
as interested as he had once been in
making lives better for other people.

1599
01:32:11,680 --> 01:32:15,640
Then he had a near fatal heart attack
in 1955 and as you often read about with

1600
01:32:15,641 --> 01:32:16,474
other people,

1601
01:32:16,660 --> 01:32:20,800
it changed his attitude toward his life
and he decided I need something more

1602
01:32:20,801 --> 01:32:23,950
than power. I need to make
that power put to a purpose.

1603
01:32:24,340 --> 01:32:28,960
And when he did finally get into the
presidency through the death of JFK and he

1604
01:32:28,961 --> 01:32:32,290
decided that the first thing he would
go for would be the civil rights act and

1605
01:32:32,291 --> 01:32:35,770
segregation in the south. Everybody
said, it's too risky. You can't do that.

1606
01:32:35,771 --> 01:32:39,040
You'll never get through the filibuster
and your presidency will be a failure

1607
01:32:39,041 --> 01:32:41,830
and you're not going to be able to win
the next election. And he said, well,

1608
01:32:41,831 --> 01:32:44,770
every now and then if you're playing
poker, you got to throw in all your chips.

1609
01:32:44,980 --> 01:32:48,910
So he had learned that through adversity.
So I think what I wanted to do was,

1610
01:32:48,911 --> 01:32:51,940
even though I knew them as family,
man, I knew their colleagues.

1611
01:32:51,941 --> 01:32:54,970
I had studied the times I'd studied
the substance of their leadership.

1612
01:32:55,330 --> 01:32:59,500
I wanted to understand how they became
leaders, how they got through adversity,

1613
01:32:59,501 --> 01:33:03,400
how they developed, how they learned
from their mistakes. And then finally,

1614
01:33:03,640 --> 01:33:05,940
the last part of the book
are case studies there,

1615
01:33:05,990 --> 01:33:07,840
the pivotal moments in their histories,

1616
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:12,250
which are Lincoln's emancipation
proclamation, which is actually,

1617
01:33:12,330 --> 01:33:16,720
I'm coming out in a Harvard business
review. This, you know, in days actually,

1618
01:33:16,721 --> 01:33:20,110
the emancipation proclamation as an
example of transformative leadership.

1619
01:33:20,620 --> 01:33:23,920
And then with Teddy, it's crisis
management, leadership of the coal strike.

1620
01:33:24,370 --> 01:33:28,840
And with FDR it's turnaround leadership
with the hundred days and with,

1621
01:33:29,190 --> 01:33:33,370
it's surprisingly visionary leadership
for Lbj on civil rights. Though,

1622
01:33:33,371 --> 01:33:36,850
obviously there's a Coda about the war
in Vietnam or his leadership utterly

1623
01:33:36,851 --> 01:33:38,800
failed and it was an epic
failure of leadership.

1624
01:33:39,190 --> 01:33:40,810
But even when I was in graduate school,

1625
01:33:40,811 --> 01:33:45,070
we used to talk about big things like
ambition. Where does ambition come from?

1626
01:33:45,400 --> 01:33:48,130
Where do you get a sense of purpose?
How do you have many in your life?

1627
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:51,040
These are the things you'd stay
up late at night to talk about.

1628
01:33:51,430 --> 01:33:54,910
And I realized that that was what I
wanted to come back to probably, you know,

1629
01:33:54,911 --> 01:33:58,720
this is in some ways a culmination
of 50 years of studying precedents,

1630
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:01,090
but is that a different level?
It's a more personal,

1631
01:34:01,091 --> 01:34:04,900
emotional level about my guys
as I call them. And I've really,

1632
01:34:04,901 --> 01:34:08,530
it's really stretched me in a way
because it meant drama and history and

1633
01:34:08,890 --> 01:34:12,060
literature. I'm not
just biography, but uh,

1634
01:34:12,220 --> 01:34:14,380
other things to try and
understand psychology,

1635
01:34:14,381 --> 01:34:16,870
to understand how they lead
and how they became leaders.

1636
01:34:18,580 --> 01:34:20,890
This is such a gift of a conversation.

1637
01:34:21,130 --> 01:34:26,130
I've had so much fun and I am
completely certain that this,

1638
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:31,800
this book is going to be so incredibly
compelling and valuable to readers

1639
01:34:35,410 --> 01:34:36,700
because as you said,
it's,

1640
01:34:37,570 --> 01:34:42,570
it's taking such a personal lens
to the stories and lessons learned,

1641
01:34:44,070 --> 01:34:49,000
visa vi these leaders that
it transcends politics,

1642
01:34:49,140 --> 01:34:49,810
uh,

1643
01:34:49,810 --> 01:34:54,810
and really touches upon so many
layers of the human experience.

1644
01:34:56,050 --> 01:34:58,400
I really appreciate you the time

1645
01:34:58,610 --> 01:35:02,060
to chat with me today and to teach,
to share all of this

1646
01:35:02,150 --> 01:35:05,340
and I enjoyed it so much.
This is so,

1647
01:35:05,460 --> 01:35:08,370
so weird to just be looking at this little
picture of your face and I feel like

1648
01:35:08,540 --> 01:35:09,590
we were talking to each other.

1649
01:35:10,750 --> 01:35:11,583
Terrific. I, you,

1650
01:35:11,670 --> 01:35:12,503
you so much.

1651
01:35:12,670 --> 01:35:12,851
Oh,

1652
01:35:12,851 --> 01:35:17,851
it's entirely my pleasure and I
really encourage everybody to,

1653
01:35:18,170 --> 01:35:22,660
uh, take a look at your new book.
Leadership Subtitle in turbulent times,

1654
01:35:22,661 --> 01:35:27,661
couldn't be more timely and
timeless in a at the same time.

1655
01:35:28,750 --> 01:35:32,900
And uh, I will link to
the book of course, uh,

1656
01:35:32,920 --> 01:35:36,580
to other, uh, pieces of your
writing in the show notes.

1657
01:35:36,581 --> 01:35:39,520
Everything we've discussed for people
listening will be in the show notes.

1658
01:35:39,521 --> 01:35:41,560
So you can find links there at Tim dot.

1659
01:35:41,561 --> 01:35:45,050
Blog slash podcast and Doris,

1660
01:35:45,070 --> 01:35:48,040
I have to ask you one more
question before we wrap up,

1661
01:35:48,041 --> 01:35:52,480
which is speaking myself as someone
who occasionally has trouble sleeping

1662
01:35:53,620 --> 01:35:54,340
mysteries.

1663
01:35:54,340 --> 01:35:58,240
Do you have any mysteries that you
might recommend or types of mysteries?

1664
01:35:58,830 --> 01:36:03,130
Absolutely. In fact, I just go
on reading one mystery rider.

1665
01:36:03,510 --> 01:36:04,710
It's sort of a binge reading.

1666
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:09,330
So just recently it's been John Grisham
and the great thing was that I was

1667
01:36:09,331 --> 01:36:14,331
already into John Grisham when a few
months ago he came up to Boston with four

1668
01:36:15,241 --> 01:36:17,250
of his friends from old Mississippi,

1669
01:36:17,610 --> 01:36:21,810
including one who was 80 years old and
had a bucket list of things he wanted to

1670
01:36:21,811 --> 01:36:23,190
do and places he wanted to see.

1671
01:36:23,191 --> 01:36:26,280
And they were on a bus together and then
they would come to these various places.

1672
01:36:26,281 --> 01:36:29,400
They went to New York. And anyway,
when they came to the Kennedy Library,

1673
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:34,200
part of the bucket list of the older guy
was for me to talk to them for a couple

1674
01:36:34,200 --> 01:36:37,320
of hours. So Grisham was
there. So it was so exciting.

1675
01:36:37,321 --> 01:36:41,940
I mean for me just having come into
reading all of his works to be actually

1676
01:36:42,210 --> 01:36:47,210
meeting him and hearing him talk about
how he creates a story and what sparks

1677
01:36:48,151 --> 01:36:52,500
his desire to write about a particular
law firm or a particular medical problem

1678
01:36:52,501 --> 01:36:54,990
that happens. So yeah,
there's something about,

1679
01:36:55,020 --> 01:36:58,740
there's something about mysteries
that just allow me to transport myself

1680
01:36:58,741 --> 01:37:00,750
somewhere else.
So I think Christian's a Greg,

1681
01:37:00,810 --> 01:37:03,650
I read Bill Clinton's new book and um,
I read,

1682
01:37:03,710 --> 01:37:07,230
I'm reading John Jake Tapper's
book right now, Hell Fire Club,

1683
01:37:07,231 --> 01:37:08,400
which is really good also.

1684
01:37:08,610 --> 01:37:10,800
So I have several of them
because when I'm up on a trip,

1685
01:37:10,801 --> 01:37:13,350
I have to take a paperback
was my suitcase is too heavy.

1686
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:16,440
So if I'm reading a hard back, I have to
have another one going at the same time.

1687
01:37:16,441 --> 01:37:18,090
But I somehow gets asleep.

1688
01:37:19,260 --> 01:37:22,690
Well no one will ever accuse you
of being an underachiever. Uh,

1689
01:37:23,190 --> 01:37:28,190
you are so gifted at telling
stories that are worth telling and,

1690
01:37:29,400 --> 01:37:31,420
and also doing the,

1691
01:37:31,460 --> 01:37:35,010
it's such an incredible depth of research
to piece it together in a narrative

1692
01:37:35,700 --> 01:37:39,090
and a story arc that is easily digested.

1693
01:37:39,210 --> 01:37:43,530
I really appreciate you doing the
work that you do. And uh, once again,

1694
01:37:43,531 --> 01:37:45,150
thank you so much for the time today.

1695
01:37:45,540 --> 01:37:47,580
I thank you for yours.
Wow.

1696
01:37:48,360 --> 01:37:50,290
And to everybody listening,

1697
01:37:50,320 --> 01:37:53,230

the show notes, Tim. Dot.

1698
01:37:53,231 --> 01:37:56,220
Blog four slash podcast and next time.
Thank

1699
01:37:56,220 --> 01:37:59,670
you for listening. Hey
guys, this is Tim again.

1700
01:37:59,671 --> 01:38:02,880
Just a few more things before
you take off. Number one,

1701
01:38:03,090 --> 01:38:08,010
this is five bullet Friday.
Do you want to get a short email from me?

1702
01:38:08,040 --> 01:38:12,210
Would you enjoy getting a short email
from me every Friday that provides a

1703
01:38:12,211 --> 01:38:15,750
little more soul of fun before the
weekend and five bullet Friday is a very

1704
01:38:15,751 --> 01:38:20,100
short email where I share the coolest
things I've found or that I've been

1705
01:38:20,101 --> 01:38:21,390
pondering over the week.

1706
01:38:21,630 --> 01:38:24,390
That could include favorite new
albums that I've discovered.

1707
01:38:24,391 --> 01:38:27,870
It could include Gizmos and gadgets
and all sorts of weird shit that I've

1708
01:38:27,871 --> 01:38:32,160
somehow dug up in the other
world of the esoteric as I do.

1709
01:38:32,430 --> 01:38:37,430
It could include favorite articles that
I've read and that I've shared with my

1710
01:38:38,101 --> 01:38:40,830
close friends, for instance.
And it's very short.

1711
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:45,870
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness
before you head off for the weekend,

1712
01:38:45,960 --> 01:38:48,120
so if you want to receive that,
check it out.

1713
01:38:48,390 --> 01:38:53,040
Just go to four hour work week.com that's
four hour work week.com all spelled

1714
01:38:53,070 --> 01:38:57,210
out and just drop in your email and you'll
get the very next one and if you sign

1715
01:38:57,211 --> 01:38:58,320
up,
I hope you enjoy it.

1716
01:38:59,880 --> 01:39:03,840
This episode is brought to you
by Intel and use them personally.

1717
01:39:03,900 --> 01:39:05,460
Ever since I wrote the
four hour work week,

1718
01:39:05,490 --> 01:39:09,540
I've been asked over and over again
how I choose to delegate tasks,

1719
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:12,510
how I do 80 20 analysis and so on.

1720
01:39:12,780 --> 01:39:16,490
At the root of many of the
decisions is a simple question.

1721
01:39:16,500 --> 01:39:17,670
Actually two questions.
Number one,

1722
01:39:17,700 --> 01:39:21,630
how can I invest money to improve my
quality of life and use that in investing

1723
01:39:21,810 --> 01:39:23,160
as well?
The second,

1724
01:39:23,430 --> 01:39:28,430
how can I spend a little money or moderate
money to save significant ink to tell

1725
01:39:29,191 --> 01:39:33,510
is one of those investments
there a turnkey solution
for all of your imaginable

1726
01:39:33,511 --> 01:39:38,040
customer care needs? I used Intel
during the launch of the four hour body,

1727
01:39:38,160 --> 01:39:38,851
which was very,

1728
01:39:38,851 --> 01:39:43,260
very involved and they provided 24
seven customer service for my land rush

1729
01:39:43,261 --> 01:39:47,820
campaign because it was critical for
me to take care of every person who

1730
01:39:47,821 --> 01:39:49,320
purchased my books in participated.

1731
01:39:49,680 --> 01:39:53,190
This allowed me to focus on
the things that I am better at.

1732
01:39:53,220 --> 01:39:57,390
My strengths like marketing claim
that we'd worked on for six months

1733
01:39:58,950 --> 01:39:59,790
until trains,

1734
01:39:59,820 --> 01:40:03,120
they're experienced customer service
reps to know your business and your

1735
01:40:03,121 --> 01:40:06,390
products inside and out and
make your customers raving fans.

1736
01:40:06,450 --> 01:40:10,530
They answer more than a million customer
service requests every year and they

1737
01:40:10,531 --> 01:40:14,820
can do so across all platforms
including email, phone, social media,

1738
01:40:14,821 --> 01:40:16,110
texts in chat,

1739
01:40:16,770 --> 01:40:20,610
leaving your customers with for
service or just mediocre service,

1740
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,370
which by the way,
in a competitive pool,

1741
01:40:23,490 --> 01:40:26,430
the huge liability long wait
times are unanswered messages,

1742
01:40:26,730 --> 01:40:30,390
carries a massive costs
and risk to your business.

1743
01:40:30,580 --> 01:40:34,610
Intel removes the logistics and
headaches of this type of communication,

1744
01:40:34,630 --> 01:40:38,730
allowing you to focus on your
strengths and grow your business.

1745
01:40:39,240 --> 01:40:41,460
It can be a real competitive advantage.
And I see many,

1746
01:40:41,461 --> 01:40:46,440
many ecommerce companies and the tech
companies thinking of customer service as

1747
01:40:46,441 --> 01:40:51,441
a good enough checkbox for an afterthought
and it just like airbnb design and

1748
01:40:52,561 --> 01:40:57,220
innovative ways to be a competitor and
to win that you can do the same thing

1749
01:40:57,250 --> 01:41:00,640
with customer service.
So as a listener of this podcast,

Tim,
this episode is brought to you by audible,

1755
01:41:20,920 --> 01:41:23,950
which has the largest selection
of audio books on the planet.

1756
01:41:23,980 --> 01:41:27,730
I've used audible for many years and I've
several audio books to recommend right

1757
01:41:27,790 --> 01:41:31,480
off the bat. If you're looking for a new
one ready player, one by Ernest Cline,

1758
01:41:31,900 --> 01:41:34,170
he may have heard of it.
The Tao of Seneca Seneca.

1759
01:41:34,210 --> 01:41:38,140
If you want to hear my favorite collection
of letters of all time as well as the

1760
01:41:38,141 --> 01:41:39,910
graveyard book by Neil Gaiman,

1761
01:41:39,970 --> 01:41:44,970
which is a fiction book I
used to reintroduce nonfiction
purists to beauty and

1762
01:41:46,661 --> 01:41:49,750
truth and enjoyment,
affection graveyard book.

1763
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:53,050
It is incredible and I like the
version that Neil reads himself,

1764
01:41:53,051 --> 01:41:56,320
but the entire ensemble cast is also fun.

1765
01:41:56,830 --> 01:42:00,970
Audible members get a credit every month,
good for any audio book in the store,

regardless of price and unused credits
roll over to the next month so he didn't

like your audio book. No problem. You can

and for some books, again,

1771
01:42:17,470 --> 01:42:20,250
graveyard book by Neil Gaiman.
I've listened to many, many times.

1772
01:42:20,251 --> 01:42:22,870
He may even just start over as soon
as you finish it the first time.

1773
01:42:23,320 --> 01:42:26,650
Audible also helps you to listen to more
books by letting you switch seamlessly

1774
01:42:26,651 --> 01:42:29,320
between devices.
Picking up exactly where you left off,

1775
01:42:29,650 --> 01:42:30,640
whether it's on your phone,

1776
01:42:30,820 --> 01:42:34,450
through your car for the tablet or
at home on an Amazon Echo, whatever.

1777
01:42:34,840 --> 01:42:36,220
You can get through tons of books,

1778
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:38,590
hands and ice free while
doing almost anything.

1779
01:42:39,010 --> 01:42:40,780
So that is part of the beauty of audio.

1780
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:43,780
It is a secondary activity when
you're walking the dog cooking,

1781
01:42:43,810 --> 01:42:44,643
whatever it might be.

1782
