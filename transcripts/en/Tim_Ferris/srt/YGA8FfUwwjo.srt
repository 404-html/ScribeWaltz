Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02,821 --> 00:00:06,000
I can run flat out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,660
I'm a cybernetic organism.

Episode of the Tim Ferriss show is brought
to you by 99 designs and ex officio.

marketplace of graphic designers and I

6
00:00:35,011 --> 00:00:39,540
have used 99 designs for years including
to get cover concepts for the four hour

You have an original design that you
love or you pay nothing. It is fantastic.

18
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,220
I have used it.

24
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,130
Ex-Officio boy, where do I begin? I
have a long history with ex-officio.

25
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:46,410
Ex-Officio makes clothing and as far
back as 2007 2008 I had a hit video that

26
00:01:48,601 --> 00:01:51,540
went viral called how to travel
the world with 10 pounds or less.

27
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:56,310
And I talked about ex-officio underwear.
Ex-Officio underwear is lightweight,

28
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,450
ultra lightweight, quick
drying and antimicrobial.
Why is this important? Well,

29
00:02:00,451 --> 00:02:03,360
I've gone through 20 plus countries
with two pairs of underwear before,

30
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,530
both from ex-officio, and I'm not
alone in this. This might sound crazy,

31
00:02:07,531 --> 00:02:10,770
but a lot of executives, for
instance, we'll take this underwear,

32
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:14,130
they'll wash it in the sink or
somewhere else, roll it up in a towel,

33
00:02:14,131 --> 00:02:18,690
like a Burrito step on it, and a few
hours later they are completely dry,

34
00:02:18,691 --> 00:02:21,780
completely clean.
You don't have to just have to and yes,

35
00:02:21,781 --> 00:02:23,790
they have to be comfortable
for all day wear,

36
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,730
but check out their clothing
as well as their underwear.

41
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,970
this clothing is not just
for the gents ladies.

42

You have choices too and they really
have an incredible collection of high

Hello might've seemed Munchkins.

46
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:02,500
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to
another episode of the Tim Ferriss show.

47
00:03:02,501 --> 00:03:04,120
It is late at night.

48
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:09,430
I'm in Boston back on the east coast
for beautiful, beautiful fall day,

49
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,080
or I should say evening.

50
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:16,110
It is probably close to 1:00 AM and I
just finished up some work with build.org

51
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:21,250
if you are an entrepreneur, you got
to check them out and build that org.

52
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:25,630
But to our subject matter at hand,
Rolf Potts,

53
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:29,170
Rolf Potts Potts for off pots,
raw fox.

54
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,080
I'm in the Halloween spirit and a,

55
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:37,081
I'm attempting to summon Rolf Potts
to my hotel room like candy man,

56
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,730
but it's not working and why
would I do such a thing anyway,

57
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:43,960
I would do that because Rolf
Potts is hilarious and he is.

58
00:03:43,961 --> 00:03:48,961
One of my favorite writers in this
episode showcases his intelligence and his

59
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:52,270
wits. I think one of the
quotes, for instance,

60
00:03:52,271 --> 00:03:55,870
is war is God's way of
teaching Americans geography.

61
00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:01,410
This guy is hilarious and he's also a
very astute observer of human nature and a

62
00:04:03,731 --> 00:04:06,400
master world traveler.
Among other things.

63
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:09,160
He is the author of several books,

64
00:04:09,161 --> 00:04:12,280
including vagabonding
in vagabond vagabonding.

65
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,820
Vagabonding has a very
important place in my life.

66
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:20,770
I sound like the the science duck
modeled after Albert Einstein.

67
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,873
I'm going to run with that,

68
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,730
but I won't subject you to that
horrible invitation for the entire bio.

69
00:04:25,731 --> 00:04:30,580
So Rolf Potts road, vagabonding
vagabonding is a very
important book in my life.

70
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:32,290
It is one of two books.

71
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,320
The other being Walden by thorough that
I took with me when I left the U S and

72
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:43,090
ended up traveling nearly 18 months
around the world in 2004 and of course all

73
00:04:43,091 --> 00:04:47,960
of those experiences set the stage
for later writing four hour workweek.

74
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:53,010
All the notes that I took and vagabonding
had a huge impact on my thinking and

75
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:57,520
how I approached all of that time.
And it was initially a four week trip.

76
00:04:57,521 --> 00:05:01,240
It turned into 18 months.
So vagabonding is an incredible book,

77
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:06,250
so much so that I partnered with Ralph
very recently to produce the audio book

78
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,050
because it is one of my
favorite books of all time.

79
00:05:08,051 --> 00:05:12,970
And you can check that out by going to
audible.com forward slash Tim's books if

80
00:05:12,971 --> 00:05:15,370
you want to check that out and get
a free sample. It's an excerpt,

81
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,950
but longterm travel,

82
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:22,360
longterm world travel does not have
to be a wealthy person's sport.

83
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:26,500
And in this conversation we talk about
all sorts of things ranging from how to

84
00:05:26,501 --> 00:05:31,120
travel, how Ralf travels
rights, wanders, gets lost,

85
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,370
study success studies,

86
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:36,430
quitting success or managing success.

87
00:05:36,431 --> 00:05:39,400
And maybe you haven't thought that's
an important element of life planning,

88
00:05:39,401 --> 00:05:43,030
but it apparently is. I've come
to believe, and I almost forgot,

89
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:48,060
of course there are a ton of resources
and links and websites and books

90
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:50,620
mentioned in this episode.

91
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,760
All of it can be found in
one place in the show notes,

92
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:59,790
so you just have to go to four hour

Tony Robbins, Mike Shinoda,

96
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,690
you name it. So you don't need to
scribble furiously unless you want to.

97
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:22,070
But four hour workweek.com forward
slash podcast is where you want to go.

98
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:26,510
And uh, I had a blast with this
interview. It is a two part interview.

99
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,550
This is going to be part one.
And then there's part two.

100
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:32,180
And I really hope you
enjoy it as much as I did.

101
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,720
It was just fantastic fun.
So without further ado,

102
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:41,000
please meet Rolf Potts.
Little Ladies and gentlemen,

103
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:44,810
this is Tim Ferriss and welcome to
another episode of the Tim Ferriss show.

104
00:06:44,811 --> 00:06:49,520
I'm very excited for this episode because
I get to catch up with a good friend

105
00:06:49,521 --> 00:06:53,930
of mine who didn't start off as a
good friend. And that is Rolf Potts.

106
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:58,790
Uh, Ralph, thank you so much for making
the time. It's good to talk to you. Yeah,

107
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,240
and I, and I realize by saying that you
didn't start off as a good friend. It's,

108
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,550
it makes it sound like we might've
been arch enemies or something.

109
00:07:04,551 --> 00:07:05,870
But what do you mean by that?

110
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:10,640
Is I really felt like I got
to know you through your book.

111
00:07:10,641 --> 00:07:15,140
Vagabonding which was one of two books.
Uh, many people do not know this,

112
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,340
that I took with me around the
world for about a year and a half,

113
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:23,120
starting in late 2004,
early 2005.

114
00:07:23,121 --> 00:07:27,230
It must've been 2004 and I,

115
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:32,231
it is one of my most heavily underlined
books and really acted as my guide and

116
00:07:33,831 --> 00:07:37,760
my companion for all
of the various travels,

117
00:07:37,761 --> 00:07:41,510
adventures and misadventures during
that time. So first and foremost,

118
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:44,240
thank you for writing such
a spectacular little tone.

119
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,740
My pleasure. Thank you
for reading. You know,

120
00:07:46,741 --> 00:07:49,890
it occurs to me that I
heard from you in late 2005,

121
00:07:49,891 --> 00:07:53,700
which was in retrospect was pretty
soon after I had written the book.

122
00:07:53,701 --> 00:07:56,360
So you must've found it
pretty soon after it came out.

123
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:59,170
Yeah, I found it. I found it. Uh,

124
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:03,890
I found it soon after it came out
because, uh, I suppose in this,

125
00:08:03,891 --> 00:08:08,720
this may be true for many people,
uh, the, the buying of the book,

126
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,960
then the reading of the book and
then the implementing of the book,

127
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:17,060
quite a bit of lag time in
between those various junctures.

128
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:20,570
And, uh, but I think like a lot of people,

129
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:24,230
I was really,
uh,

130
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:30,360
I spend a lot of time
fantasizing about travel and, uh,

131
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,580
taking that leap,

132
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,240
but had more than handful
of nebulous fear about it.

133
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:43,080
And, uh, I suppose we could
start there actually, and, uh,

134
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:45,490
naked ask very simply,
it,

135
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:49,250
what are some recommendations
that you have for people who,

136
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:54,310
who may be able to work up
the savings if necessary and,

137
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:54,741
uh,

138
00:08:54,741 --> 00:08:59,741
are really just fearful of taking the
leap and exploring longterm travel.

139
00:08:59,911 --> 00:09:01,650
And I suppose just wrapped into that,

140
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:05,460
you might give a brief description of
vagabonding itself and the subtitle and,

141
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,090
and, uh, and, and why
you wrote it. But, uh,

142
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:13,710
I'll let you explore that
multipart question if you
wouldn't, uh, wouldn't mind.

143
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,240
Yeah.
Well,

144
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,570
I liked that you bring up the idea of
fantasizing about travel because I think

145
00:09:18,571 --> 00:09:22,200
it's something that everybody does
and it's one of those top three,

146
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,990
if not top two or one things that
people dream about that and you,

147
00:09:25,991 --> 00:09:28,920
and you see it in the movies
all the time. Um, and in fact,

148
00:09:28,921 --> 00:09:30,390
I mentioned this in vagabonding,
you know,

149
00:09:30,391 --> 00:09:35,310
the heist movie where the whole goal
is to have this complicated, um,

150
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:39,390
robbery so they can have enough money to,
to move overseas to a wonderful place.

151
00:09:39,391 --> 00:09:41,760
And as I say in the book is that you
don't need to rob a bank to do that.

152
00:09:41,761 --> 00:09:46,290
In fact, you can do that
for a cost that is equal to,

153
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:50,700
and sometimes less than your cost of
living in a major American city. Uh,

154
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:55,730
and so I think an important principle
I bring up in vagabonding is saying,

155
00:09:56,131 --> 00:09:59,940
don't, don't put this off if you're
dreaming about travel. And most people do.

156
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,220
And you know, and if you don't
run about travel, that's fine.

157
00:10:02,221 --> 00:10:04,440
But I really address these travel dreams,

158
00:10:04,441 --> 00:10:08,580
which are so common that don't wait until
you get to tell you're too old because,

159
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:13,090
um, you know, retirement isn't
necessarily the best time to, to, uh,

160
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:16,740
to do something like this. And
in fact, a Henry David Thoreau,

161
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:19,230
I think Walden Woods is the other
book you'd, you took on your travels.

162
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:24,090
That's right. Talks about how people,
and I'm not quoting him directly, they,

163
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:24,421
you know,

164
00:10:24,421 --> 00:10:28,170
they put off what they really want to do
until they're too old to actually do it.

165
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:33,150
And you know, that's a paraphrase.
Um, and so if you're 18, 28,

166
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:37,680
38, 48, whenever you'd ring
them about travel, put,

167
00:10:37,681 --> 00:10:39,470
make your goals soon and,

168
00:10:39,471 --> 00:10:43,320
and don't put off those goals because
they're very attainable. And you know,

169
00:10:43,321 --> 00:10:48,321
I think there's a lot of fears that are
tied in to confronting vagabonding which

170
00:10:49,501 --> 00:10:53,220
you asked me if the, for the definition
it's money and as long term travel,

171
00:10:53,221 --> 00:10:57,590
it's not just a vacation, it's not a
week or two off. Um, that you know,

172
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,460
society gives you as a vacation.

173
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:03,140
It's six months or two
years or s you know,

174
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:06,450
six weeks that you make for
yourself to travel in earnest,

175
00:11:06,451 --> 00:11:10,410
not as a consumer experience, not
as a vacation, but as you know,

176
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:15,360
a more deeply meaningful life experience
and as a way to actualize your wealth

177
00:11:15,361 --> 00:11:16,020
of time.

178
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,870
And I think this is an idea we'll come
back to a lot and it's something that you

179
00:11:18,871 --> 00:11:21,300
write about as well as me
as the idea of time wealth,

180
00:11:21,301 --> 00:11:25,720
the idea that your experiences are
more valuable in life. Then the,

181
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:26,960
the things that you accumulate,

182
00:11:26,961 --> 00:11:31,350
then the things that are all is being
touted as the most important things in

183
00:11:31,351 --> 00:11:36,210
life. So a travel is a great way
to cash in on your time wealth. Um,

184
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:40,080
and vagabonding just by definition
is a more meaningful way of travel.

185
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:44,520
It's a way of slowing down and really
discovering parts of yourself instead of

186
00:11:44,521 --> 00:11:46,620
just buying a lot of experiences,
which is,

187
00:11:46,621 --> 00:11:51,120
which we've sort of been conditioned
to do, uh, as American consumers.

188
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,390
My first vagabonding trip was
20 years ago this year. Um,

189
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:59,020
oddly enough and happy
anniversary. Thank you. Thank you.

190
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,120
It was just this time that I was,

191
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:04,780
that I was straggling back to Kansas
after having this amazing eight month trip

192
00:12:04,781 --> 00:12:08,260
around North America and it was a
trip that I thought would be my last,

193
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:11,320
I thought I would get travel out of my
system so I could become a responsible

194
00:12:11,321 --> 00:12:16,120
American workaholic and then maybe
returned to travel and I was old. But you,

195
00:12:16,121 --> 00:12:21,121
you mentioned the idea of fear and
the fear is I had going out were um,

196
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,280
you know, is this going to
be expensive? It's going to,

197
00:12:24,281 --> 00:12:25,690
is this going to be dangerous?

198
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:29,260
Am I going to come back and
be compromised professionally?

199
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:33,220
And all of those sort of turned into the,
into the opposite,

200
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:37,660
that it was a lot safer than I expected.
It was a lot cheaper than I expected.

201
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:42,700
And I came back and for 20 years had
been integrating, uh, travel, uh, with,

202
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:47,680
with a, a professional life that
continues to diversify. I continue to, to,

203
00:12:47,681 --> 00:12:50,200
to do other things, to make money, uh,

204
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:53,290
while at the same time having
big swaths of time to travel.

205
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,960
And I'm not suggesting that
everybody needs to, you know,

206
00:12:55,961 --> 00:12:58,600
become a vagabond or for a 20 year chunk.

207
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:01,960
And in some ways I travel a lot
less than I used to, um, you know,

208
00:13:01,961 --> 00:13:05,050
10 or 15 years ago.
But it's something that you can do.

209
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:07,750
It's an option that you can have and it's,
it's not an APP,

210
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:11,550
an option that you wait for life
to give you, you create it. Uh,

211
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,410
and so I'm a big believer in the active,
uh,

212
00:13:14,411 --> 00:13:17,770
aspect of vagabonding
of saving your money.

213
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:20,370
The lottery is another
metaphor I use a lot in,

214
00:13:20,371 --> 00:13:24,910
in vagabonding that people keep waiting
for the lottery to reward them. Um,

215
00:13:24,911 --> 00:13:28,120
but as, as we all know, the
odds that you're gonna win
the lottery is pretty low,

216
00:13:28,121 --> 00:13:31,120
but we've already won the lottery.
We're born with time wealth.

217
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:35,950
And so it's just a matter of creating
these travel experiences or these time

218
00:13:35,951 --> 00:13:40,530
rich experiences, uh, through
things like simplicity and a,

219
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:44,220
just the decision to make these
sort of things happen. Well, that's

220
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,640
one of the,

221
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:50,910
the scenes and I think gifts that you
provide in vagabonding and for those

222
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:54,700
perhaps wondering this,
the subtitle says a lot,

223
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:58,330
which is an uncommon guide to
the art of longterm world travel.

224
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:03,360
And I think uncommon in art or
both keywords in that subtitle,

225
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:07,990
uh, you provide a, a,

226
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:13,230
a portfolio, it sounds to
financial, yeah, a quiver of,

227
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,760
of philosophies and uh,
uh,

228
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:20,500
suggestions for simplification,

229
00:14:20,501 --> 00:14:22,960
viewing the world
through a different Lens,

230
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:28,610
really decluttering your
life both materially and, uh,

231
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:33,250
emotionally and psychologically.
Even if you do not travel.

232
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:38,310
And what I've noticed is
I recommend vagabonding to
people who have no intention

233
00:14:39,761 --> 00:14:44,290
of travelling or for whatever set of
circumstances feel they can't travel, uh,

234
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,310
simply because, uh, and uh,

235
00:14:48,311 --> 00:14:51,730
I'm blanking on the
attribution here, but, uh,

236
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:53,420
I really believe that most people,

237
00:14:53,421 --> 00:14:57,890
even those who have more money than
they know what to do with live lives of

238
00:14:57,891 --> 00:15:01,370
quiet desperation and they have this,
they've,

239
00:15:01,371 --> 00:15:06,371
they've fallen into a drone like schedule
where they have these material objects

240
00:15:08,181 --> 00:15:11,750
they thought might make them happy or
give them something they were lacking

241
00:15:11,751 --> 00:15:15,770
beforehand, but they've lost that, uh,

242
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:20,390
the excitement and anticipation perhaps
that they once had, you know, the, the,

243
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:23,870
the leaping into the
unknown, uh, the, the,

244
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:27,890
the feeling that kids have the night
before Christmas or the week before

245
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:29,570
Christmas and adults lose that.
Nothing.

246
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,430
One of the easiest ways to capture that
is to actually fantasize about travel,

247
00:15:34,431 --> 00:15:37,640
but do it in detail. Right? So
not one day I want to travel,

248
00:15:37,641 --> 00:15:41,770
but to read vagabonding and go, oh my
God. Like I could do a, I could be,

249
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:45,530
I could go to Japan for the first time.
I could go to Europe and Busk,

250
00:15:45,531 --> 00:15:49,640
I could do all of these things that,
that rekindle,

251
00:15:49,641 --> 00:15:53,720
that passion and enthusiasm
and excitement, uh,

252
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,510
because I think that
excitement is a much more, uh,

253
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:00,360
tangible metric for perhaps,
uh,

254
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:04,400
what other otherwise can be very
nebulous in the word successful,

255
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:07,760
right in the US. I think that,
uh, for better or for worse,

256
00:16:07,761 --> 00:16:10,900
and I think perhaps for both,
we have this, uh, you know,

257
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:15,920
Protestant like work ethic towards
a relatively undefined goal,

258
00:16:16,011 --> 00:16:19,120
which is this, this success. And, um,

259
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:23,990
what are some exercises just in terms
of helping to address that fear?

260
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:27,300
So you mentioned one thing
which would be setting a,

261
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:30,260
a near time horizon for
travel, right? And I,

262
00:16:30,261 --> 00:16:34,580
I completely agree that the,
in many ways the utility of travel,

263
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:38,750
uh, decreases as your physical
capacity decreases, right?

264
00:16:38,751 --> 00:16:42,650
So you can do the most, you
have the most options. Uh,

265
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,680
the younger you are when you
travel, or at least, uh, the,

266
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:47,930
the more functional your
body is when you traveled,

267
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:53,450
aside from setting a tight goal
and whether that's, you know,

268
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:57,370
a few weeks away, a few months
away, uh, what are some extra,

269
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:01,280
are there any exercises that people can
go through to decrease that fear factor

270
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,031
and a,

271
00:17:02,031 --> 00:17:05,930
or anything they can read but besides
vagabonding to decrease that fear factor

272
00:17:05,931 --> 00:17:10,070
and their, their stories, for
instance, that I'll tell folks, uh,

273
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:14,690
about, uh, Columbia is a good example.
So I recently, not too long ago,

274
00:17:14,691 --> 00:17:17,600
spent a month in Midian,
Columbia,

275
00:17:17,601 --> 00:17:20,660
which was formerly the murder
capital of the world, uh,

276
00:17:20,661 --> 00:17:24,860
when it was under the iron fist of
Pablo Escobar, the drug kingpin.

277
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,140
And I,
I,

278
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:33,700
I feel more threatened on market street
in San Francisco on a daily basis

279
00:17:34,461 --> 00:17:37,490
whenever I go and walk down
certain portions of market street,

280
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:41,930
then I ever felt in Midian.
And I went all throughout the entire city.

281
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:46,130
Uh, and, uh, you know, I think that
sometimes the stories can be helpful,

282
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:51,131
but do you have any recommendations for
whether it's exercises or things to read

283
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:55,650
to sort of overcome the fear
of the, the big bed, uh,

284
00:17:55,651 --> 00:18:00,510
overseas adventures and all the
terrible things that await you were not?

285
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,660
Yeah, well add. There's a couple of
big picture ones. It, it's funny.

286
00:18:04,661 --> 00:18:05,411
[inaudible] I was,

287
00:18:05,411 --> 00:18:09,280
I was just there a year and a half ago
and I think now it's like the breast

288
00:18:09,281 --> 00:18:10,930
augmentation capitol of the world.

289
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:18,780
Yeah. It's, it's a, yeah. You know,
South America is, it's like the CR,

290
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:23,700
I guess Korea has its facial bleaching
and then, you know, South America has a,

291
00:18:23,701 --> 00:18:26,610
if you Brazil there, it's the,
the implant capitol of the world,

292
00:18:26,611 --> 00:18:30,270
which is still incredible just to
even ponder. But yes, continue.

293
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,104
Sorry to interrupt.

294
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:34,770
Right now the drug lords moved out in,
the plastic surgeons moves in. That's it.

295
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:38,150
It's a beautiful city. But that
was just, it was a strange,

296
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,760
like physical attribute, um, that it's,

297
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:45,230
it's obviously a surgeons had been
hard at work, wonderful city. Um, the,

298
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,540
the advice is the advice
that I have. There's a couple
of a big picture ones, uh,

299
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:53,990
big picture advice that I have for this.
And one is too,

300
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,780
they're both sort of mental. They're
about redefining your relationship. Um,

301
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,170
or just how you think about things.

302
00:19:00,171 --> 00:19:03,080
One is your relationship to money and
what it represents and what is your

303
00:19:03,081 --> 00:19:07,700
relationship to information and what it
represents. Um, you mentioned success,

304
00:19:07,701 --> 00:19:10,730
you know, the idea of the
American, uh, you know,

305
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,950
puritanical idea of what success is.

306
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,890
And money is a great metric for success,

307
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,290
but it's not the only metric for success.

308
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:22,610
And I think people fixate on money
to their own detriment because I met,

309
00:19:22,611 --> 00:19:25,910
as I mentioned before, it doesn't take
that much money to travel. The world.

310
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:30,460
Travel isn't a consumer experience.
And I think you,

311
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,730
you said you weren't sure the reference,

312
00:19:31,731 --> 00:19:34,580
I think you're recording throw when
you're sort of talking about these rich

313
00:19:34,581 --> 00:19:37,670
people who were sort of bound
by their own riches and he's,

314
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,290
he's actually stealing that from
the Bible. And, and, and the,

315
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:45,020
the Old Hindu scriptures, which talk
about these, these golden chains with,

316
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:47,030
you know, under which we sink. You know,

317
00:19:47,031 --> 00:19:50,540
we're bound to our possessions
and through success,

318
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:53,090
it is a very old philosophical idea.

319
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:56,300
Through success we lose perspective on,

320
00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:01,660
on the good life because we tie success
so closely with money and possessions

321
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:05,990
and material splendor.
And so if you can,

322
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:10,730
if you can just redefine your
relationship with what success is,

323
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:15,110
um, and, and, and really goes
back to the idea of time, wealth,

324
00:20:15,111 --> 00:20:18,500
that success is being able to do
what you want, whenever you want.

325
00:20:18,501 --> 00:20:23,420
And there's billionaires out there who
are compromised in ways that you or I or

326
00:20:23,421 --> 00:20:26,870
you know, you're a plumber or your
local park ranger, um, are not,

327
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,940
because just realizing that money is
a tool, it's not a metric for success.

328
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:34,760
It's a nice side product of success,

329
00:20:34,761 --> 00:20:38,720
but it's a tool for allowing you to live
a time rich and experience rich life

330
00:20:38,721 --> 00:20:43,721
and really live in ways that allow you
to not only follow but discover passions

331
00:20:43,971 --> 00:20:45,320
that you never realized you had.

332
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:50,860
No, I, I, uh, I, I, I agree
on so many levels and just,

333
00:20:50,861 --> 00:20:53,850
just to, because of course the, uh, we,

334
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:57,940
we both think about this stuff a lot
and I apologize for jumping in, but the,

335
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:02,660
the, just on the billionaire point to
give some concrete examples. So the,

336
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,990
this is very recent. I was talking to a
fellow, he is putting together an event,

337
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,360
it's going to be 20 or 30 people,

338
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:15,690
a number of billionaires and attendance
and it's a week long retreat of sorts.

339
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:21,100
And, and he said to me, and
this is a very, uh, this,

340
00:21:21,101 --> 00:21:25,840
this actually that the
gentlemen is organizing it
is very materially successful

341
00:21:25,841 --> 00:21:30,310
but actually has a very level head on
his shoulders and has been able to keep

342
00:21:30,311 --> 00:21:35,311
things like time and mobility in mind
is as important currency and metrics for

343
00:21:35,471 --> 00:21:38,290
his quality of life. Cc, he's done
a really good job, but he said,

344
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,220
of course the billionaires can't take
a week off so they're only going to be

345
00:21:42,221 --> 00:21:44,830
there for 24 to 36 hours.
And I thought about that

346
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,440
and the billionaires
can't take a week off.

347
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:53,980
What the hell is the point of having
their billion dollars if they can't,

348
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:57,190
if they don't have the options,
if they have fewer options than I do,

349
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,120
if that makes sense.

350
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:03,540
And it reminded me of a conversation I
had at one point with a another person

351
00:22:05,051 --> 00:22:08,470
who shall remain unnamed, but he has at
least several hundred million dollars,

352
00:22:08,471 --> 00:22:10,860
maybe a billion plus.
And uh,

353
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:15,570
he was commenting on the number
of homes that he had and uh,

354
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:19,590
he's a good guy. It, but in
effect, his accumulation had,

355
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:24,680
had gotten so out of control and the ad
between six and 12 homes around the u s

356
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:25,953
and he said,

357
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:30,280
I know I no longer feel
like people work for me.

358
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,080
I feel like I work for them because he
has staff of five to 10 people at each of

359
00:22:35,081 --> 00:22:38,920
these homes.
He's never at nine out of 10 of them.

360
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,091
And uh,

361
00:22:40,091 --> 00:22:44,740
so he's effectively just working to pay
for homes where his staff basically are

362
00:22:44,741 --> 00:22:49,180
the owners of the homes because they
live there. And I was like, wow,

363
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:53,230
it really brings to mind.
Um,

364
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:58,210
uh, this is also a quote, of
course, I don't know the, the, uh,

365
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:00,720
the attribution, but the, the,

366
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:05,710
the idea that things an excess
become their opposite, right? So, uh,

367
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:08,260
you know,
money that provides you with freedom

368
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,350
basically takes away your
freedom, uh, when it's, when it,

369
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:17,980
when it reaches a certain point, it
starts to reduce your freedom. Uh,

370
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:22,900
the idea that so called freedom
fighters, uh, in, in excess,

371
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:25,310
you know, given too much power,
become tyrants, right? So,

372
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:30,430
so things tend to flip when they get
to a certain point of excess. Um,

373
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,380
what, and, and, uh,

374
00:23:32,381 --> 00:23:37,381
also just because I'm such a die hard
fan boy of vagabonding correct me if I'm

375
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:42,000
wrong, but the example that I think
you gave in vagabonding of, uh,

376
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:48,180
of sort of Hollywood nonsense related
to overseas travel was from Wall Street,

377
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,620
wasn't it? From Wall
Street where the, the,

378
00:23:51,621 --> 00:23:54,800
the Charlie Sheen's big goal was
to save up enough money, you know,

379
00:23:54,801 --> 00:23:57,260
one day when he strikes it big to,
uh,

380
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:01,550
to get a motorcycle and drive a
car across China, I think. Yeah.

381
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:07,580
And you pointed out that you could scrub
toilets and China not even in the u s

382
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:12,710
for a month or two and probably figure
out a way financially to make that

383
00:24:12,711 --> 00:24:17,580
possible. Um, so certainly, I
mean, when I was traveling and,

384
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:21,830
and ultimately putting together the notes
and observations that became the four

385
00:24:21,831 --> 00:24:22,664
hour work week,

386
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:27,820
I save tens of thousands of dollars
compared to simply staying in the bay area

387
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:33,310
in California. And,
uh, anyway, just a well

388
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:38,210
that's, that's the thing is that if you
live in, in an expensive city, like, like,

389
00:24:38,211 --> 00:24:41,900
uh, you know, San Francisco,
New York, um, there,

390
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,760
there's probably a half dozen other
examples in the United States alone.

391
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:49,110
You're going to be living on
fewer dollars per day by far.

392
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:53,340
If you're traveling in Southeast Asia
or South America or the Middle East,

393
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:56,940
then you would just be paying your bills
and paying your rent and buying your

394
00:24:56,941 --> 00:24:58,650
groceries at home that you're,

395
00:24:58,651 --> 00:25:01,230
you're traveling in a completely
different economic zone.

396
00:25:01,231 --> 00:25:05,310
Which was sort of the point of, of
pointing out this Wall Street example, uh,

397
00:25:05,311 --> 00:25:07,200
in China, that was, that
movie was from the 80s.

398
00:25:07,201 --> 00:25:09,870
Certainly China is more
expensive since then. Uh,

399
00:25:09,871 --> 00:25:11,730
you might not have to clean toilets,

400
00:25:11,731 --> 00:25:15,150
you might have to clean something else
now to ride your motorcycle across China.

401
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:18,390
But the point is, is that, uh, you know,

402
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:22,700
all this importance is placed
upon conspicuous consumption.

403
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:25,290
A romantic idea is of what we can do a,

404
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:29,880
and oftentimes it's not money that's
in the way. It's a mindset thing.

405
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:34,800
Um, which is why, um, I'm sort
of answering your question,

406
00:25:34,801 --> 00:25:36,690
your earlier question in
big picture way that it's,

407
00:25:36,691 --> 00:25:40,590
it's really a mindset
about your relationship to
money and your relationship

408
00:25:40,591 --> 00:25:44,700
with Tim formation, which I'll get to
in a second. But you were talking about,

409
00:25:44,701 --> 00:25:44,851
you know,

410
00:25:44,851 --> 00:25:49,110
the billionaire who has sort of become
a slave to his own parasitical wealth.

411
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:51,090
That's an old idea too.

412
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:55,560
I have a quote from the ancient
Sanskrit scriptures in vagabonding,

413
00:25:55,561 --> 00:25:59,730
which is about the king in his
palace only has half a bad and, and,

414
00:25:59,731 --> 00:26:04,080
and the food on his plate for all the
grain in his fields. Does he own the rest?

415
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:07,260
You know, right. At the end
of the day, even the Kings,

416
00:26:07,261 --> 00:26:11,640
and I knew this 3000 years ago,
even kings only eat one meal at a time.

417
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:15,930
They only sleep in one bed at a
time. Um, and at the end of the day,

418
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,870
the substance of your life
is through experience.

419
00:26:18,871 --> 00:26:22,740
And if you're suddenly compromised,
your material wealth and your money is,

420
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,550
is there to actualize your
experience and, and um, you know,

421
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:28,050
to enhance your life meaning,

422
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:32,160
and the moment that it becomes parasitical
the moment that you're a billionaire

423
00:26:32,161 --> 00:26:34,710
who has 36 hours to go to a conference.

424
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:38,220
And I'd love to know how much money
is spent flying to the conference,

425
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:40,770
catering it, you know,
because I, you know,

426
00:26:40,771 --> 00:26:44,730
I know people who could travel probably
for five on what 1 billion our spins to

427
00:26:44,731 --> 00:26:46,380
go to that 36 hour conference.

428
00:26:46,381 --> 00:26:48,660
And I'm sure you know people
who could do the same.

429
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:52,710
So that's just such an important
thing to keep in mind is to,

430
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:55,290
I have nothing against
success or material success,

431
00:26:55,291 --> 00:26:59,850
but really know where the line
is. The point at which, um,

432
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:03,890
the success you've achieved is actually
getting into the way of actualizing a,

433
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:08,880
a good and meaningful, uh,
and option filled life.

434
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,760
Definitely. Where does, where does
the information come in? I'm a,

435
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,130
I'm very curious,
have the,

436
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:19,200
the relationship to information plays
into all of this, right? Well, this is a,

437
00:27:19,201 --> 00:27:23,220
this is where the, the fear factor comes
in. You were talking about Metta Gene,

438
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:27,810
you know, there's a Mexico, um, that
has a lot of drug war violence going on.

439
00:27:27,811 --> 00:27:30,890
Of course, the Middle
East is a perennially, uh,

440
00:27:30,891 --> 00:27:34,290
a bad reputation place to travel to.
Um,

441
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:39,740
but keep in mind that
information is something that
can work against you or work

442
00:27:40,201 --> 00:27:44,040
for you. And these days,
information is everywhere. When I,

443
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:47,250
when I left to travel the
United States 20 years ago,

444
00:27:47,251 --> 00:27:52,251
I was actually more afraid of the United
States then in 1994 then I'm afraid of

445
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:55,500
any place, uh, in,

446
00:27:55,501 --> 00:28:00,501
in 2014 simply because their
beef pre worldwide web I had,

447
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:05,490
I didn't know what to expect.
I had no examples. I've been
in Kansas, which is not,

448
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,120
you know,
in sort of bullseye middleclass circles.

449
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:12,480
I didn't have a lot of friends
traveling full time. Um,

450
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:16,130
and so I didn't really have anything
to compare it to. Now if you're,

451
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:19,130
if you're a successful person
with the money to do it and,

452
00:28:19,131 --> 00:28:22,870
and the physical capacity to do
it, you can go online. Uh, and,

453
00:28:22,871 --> 00:28:26,250
and not only can you, can you realize
that people are traveling in Mexico,

454
00:28:26,251 --> 00:28:28,950
they're traveling and Columbia,
they're traveling, uh, in,

455
00:28:28,951 --> 00:28:32,400
in Egypt and Israel and other parts of
the world where you think that might be

456
00:28:32,401 --> 00:28:34,800
dangerous.
You realize that there's,

457
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:39,120
there's family bloggers out there who
are traveling with five kids to these

458
00:28:39,121 --> 00:28:44,121
places or traveling with
a diabetes problem or with
physical handicaps or with,

459
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:45,120
you know,

460
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:49,770
money that they've made on a job that
has a fraction of what most people make.

461
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,740
You know, people who have simply
decided to become wealthy in time,

462
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:58,100
regardless of the fact that they work
as park rangers or exotic dancers or

463
00:28:58,741 --> 00:29:02,610
maintenance men. Um, and so
that that information you can,

464
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:07,500
if you get past,
I guess media exists in a,

465
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:09,330
in a man bites dog world,

466
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:13,620
they're going to talk about explosions
and revolutions and bad things around the

467
00:29:13,621 --> 00:29:17,520
world. Um, and so much of
what we understand, in fact,

468
00:29:17,521 --> 00:29:19,780
there's that famous
phrase, you know, war is,

469
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,440
is God's way of teaching
Americans geography.

470
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:27,270
God,
that's so horrible and so true.

471
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:33,660
And so because Americans are so NC pillar,

472
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,380
our international understanding is
really pegged to major world events that

473
00:29:37,381 --> 00:29:41,380
don't really represent day to day life
and the towns of these towns around world.

474
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:47,150
So if you can look past the panic
driven man bites dog tenor of media and

475
00:29:48,071 --> 00:29:53,071
realize that Mexico is actually a giant
country and that the drug violence is

476
00:29:53,141 --> 00:29:55,630
very isolated and that
there are ways to travel in,

477
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:59,410
in a very safe way and a very
inexpensive way, then suddenly Mexico,

478
00:29:59,411 --> 00:30:02,680
it becomes this amazing and
very close way to travel. My,

479
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:07,690
my sister is a college professor in
North Central Kansas and she, they, they,

480
00:30:07,691 --> 00:30:11,360
she and her family took
a little, um, there's a,

481
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:15,490
a big Mexican American community in Kansas
and they just took the local Mexican

482
00:30:15,491 --> 00:30:20,020
minivan now down to Fresno or Mexico
and just a family of four. And they,

483
00:30:20,021 --> 00:30:23,740
they've traveled for next to nothing in
an amazing way for their teenage sons,

484
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:28,360
uh, in to, uh, to a part of the world that
people assume is full of drug violence.

485
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:32,330
Right? And, and that was just taking a
minivan from five blocks over, you know,

486
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:34,990
away from where they live.
And so that information,

487
00:30:34,991 --> 00:30:38,890
realizing that the big picture news
media information is always going to be

488
00:30:38,891 --> 00:30:43,180
panic driven. It's always going
to be a, you know, man bites dog.

489
00:30:43,181 --> 00:30:47,860
And so the more you get to the
specific information and think, hmm,

490
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:51,070
you know, I'm, I'm 37 years old, um,

491
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:55,390
I'm looking to take a sabbatical
from my job. I live in Virginia,

492
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:58,330
uh, and I like to drink beer. Well,

493
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:03,400
within 30 minutes you can find somebody
who's from a very similar life situation,

494
00:31:03,401 --> 00:31:07,570
who's doing what you're doing. Um,
and again, even if, I mean there's,

495
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:11,190
I mean there's people who
are blind who are out,

496
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,230
who are traveling for years at a
time. There, there are people with,

497
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:16,630
with major impediments,
uh,

498
00:31:16,631 --> 00:31:19,780
and if you're able bodied and you
have a little money socked away,

499
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:23,400
there's really nothing stopping
you except your own fear,

500
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:28,420
which has sometimes tied to your ideas
of money or your ideas of what the world

501
00:31:28,541 --> 00:31:31,110
is like, which is pegged
to information. Right.

502
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:33,120
Agreed. What, uh,

503
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:38,150
what type of sites or resources would
you recommend to people who are trying to

504
00:31:39,001 --> 00:31:41,670
find a comparable folks?

505
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:46,200
Let's just say people who will help them
alleviate their fear of travel or just

506
00:31:46,201 --> 00:31:49,680
in general, what type of online
resources do you recommend?

507
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:55,430
Um, well Google for one, I mean
if you just Google, you know,

508
00:31:56,630 --> 00:32:00,050
35 year old years old, two
kids, one year of travel,

509
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:04,310
then odds are you'll find 20 blogs of
people in that demographic who are doing

510
00:32:04,311 --> 00:32:06,560
just that.
So,

511
00:32:06,561 --> 00:32:11,561
so really be the unabashed Ed
and very specific about googling,

512
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:17,420
you know, your fears or your demographic
and just see who like you is,

513
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,510
is out traveling. The world. There's
a lot of great traveler communities.

514
00:32:20,511 --> 00:32:23,540
I've been affiliated with
boots and all.com, um,

515
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,910
since the very beginning of vagabonding.

516
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:30,980
And part of their emo is just
sort of creating community and,

517
00:32:30,981 --> 00:32:35,390
and uh, and support, uh,
for people. And they have,

518
00:32:35,391 --> 00:32:38,930
they have blogs and resources on their
site and there's other travel communities.

519
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:39,913
Well,

520
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:44,270
and uh, you know, you, you,
um, and boots and all is well,

521
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:48,500
we'll put the links to everything in the
show of course in the show notes, uh,

522
00:32:48,501 --> 00:32:53,410
for those people listening. But, uh,
it's boots, the letter n all.com, right?

523
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:57,810
Yeah. B O t s n a l l.com. Uh, and,

524
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,320
and they'd been operating out of Portland,

525
00:33:00,321 --> 00:33:04,190
Oregon for years and have just
quietly been doing very, this,

526
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:09,380
the nice work of a reassurance and saying,
oh, so you, so you're worried about it.

527
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:12,140
Uh, and around the world flight,
well, here's what around the house,

528
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:14,270
around the world, flights.
Look, you know, you're,

529
00:33:14,271 --> 00:33:16,850
you're worried about a certain
situation, you know, here's,

530
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:20,330
here are some resources for
that. And, and they're not alone.

531
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:22,910
I'm most familiar with them because we,
we've been,

532
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:25,610
we've sort of shared a similar
mission for a long time,

533
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:29,180
but there are big
communities of travelers who,

534
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:33,920
who are happy to help and, and sort of
help new newbies feel better about these,

535
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:36,500
uh,
prospects have of longterm travel.

536
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,720
Yeah,
they're all over.

537
00:33:37,721 --> 00:33:42,430
I remember one that was very helpful
to me in the beginning was a virtual

538
00:33:42,431 --> 00:33:47,431
tourist.com and that I was with the site
for a long time and then the four hour

539
00:33:50,261 --> 00:33:53,770
work week came out and I ended up becoming
friends much in the same way that I

540
00:33:53,771 --> 00:33:55,150
reached out to you.
Uh,

541
00:33:55,170 --> 00:34:00,170
I became friends with the founder of
virtual tourist and some now actually

542
00:34:00,221 --> 00:34:02,380
involved with a site of his called trippy,

543
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:05,970
which is just trippy Dotcom as
people would expect. But, uh, it's a,

544
00:34:05,971 --> 00:34:07,360
it's effectively community of,

545
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:10,630
of open questions and you can
follow specific locations, right.

546
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:15,520
So if you're interested in, whether it's
San Francisco, Buenos Iras, Spain, Midian,

547
00:34:15,521 --> 00:34:20,170
whatever, all of the questions that
come up, for instance, I am just,

548
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:22,040
I'm just taking a quick
look here and you can add,

549
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,660
you can pose any question
you want, but, uh, you know,

550
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:29,530
what's the steepest place you've
ever been in country x, uh,

551
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:32,310
the, uh, what,

552
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,840
where's the best rock
climbing in San Francisco,

553
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:38,530
which is generally going to be
extremely inexpensive. You know,

554
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:41,830
what are the best online tools for
group vacation planning? So if you're,

555
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:44,830
if you're a family or multiple
families, so like you said, there,

556
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:49,840
there are many different options.
Speaking of, of technology, uh,

557
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:54,790
how have, how have, uh,
different services like,

558
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:55,300
um,

559
00:34:55,300 --> 00:35:00,300
whether it's couch surfing
or even say a airbnb or,

560
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,220
uh,
anything else really,

561
00:35:03,221 --> 00:35:07,690
these collaborative consumption
companies changed travel,

562
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:11,770
um, for you, uh, and, and, uh,

563
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,440
perhaps there are older examples,
but you mentioned that you're, uh,

564
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:18,360
you're taking a trip before
we started recording. Uh,

565
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:21,600
and you're doing a home
swap. Is that, is, uh,

566
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,770
would you mind perhaps elaborating on,
um,

567
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:29,140
how some of those options work,
those that you're familiar with?

568
00:35:29,141 --> 00:35:33,760
Because I think that many people who
consider travel think in terms of one of

569
00:35:33,761 --> 00:35:38,580
their main expenses being staying
in a hotel. Right. Uh, and,

570
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:41,640
uh, I'd love for you to share
any of your thoughts on that.

571
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:46,800
Yeah, well, it's shifted the way
the travel world works in, in,

572
00:35:46,801 --> 00:35:50,490
in some ways that are delightfully
convenient. Uh, and, and,

573
00:35:50,491 --> 00:35:52,550
and in some ways that are
a little bit strange, I,

574
00:35:52,551 --> 00:35:56,370
I think that technology is one of those
double edged swords that in some ways

575
00:35:56,730 --> 00:36:00,630
has turned this into insufferable
micro managers on the road.

576
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:03,630
Can you elaborate on that?

577
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,970
Yeah. Well, I'll, I'll start with
the negative. Um, you know, I,

578
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:12,180
I the travel culture, which I
started in, which was 20 years ago,

579
00:36:12,181 --> 00:36:16,990
but really my more international traveler
travels are more like 15 years ago. Um,

580
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:21,530
it's about showing up in town and
knowing that when you get there, um,

581
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,790
the unexpected awaits you that you,

582
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,620
that you're going to walk
to the hotel district.

583
00:36:25,621 --> 00:36:29,170
You may have a guidebook with
some hotel recommendations. Um,

584
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:32,010
but you're going to shop for your hotel.
You're not going to find a deal online.

585
00:36:32,011 --> 00:36:34,680
You're going to walk in there,
you're going to see the room. Um,

586
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,500
you're going to haggle because in,
in, in all throughout Asia, you know,

587
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:43,010
basically any place outside
of the industrial world,
prices are up for grabs. And,

588
00:36:43,011 --> 00:36:45,250
and,
and haggling in person is so much more,

589
00:36:45,251 --> 00:36:48,750
it gives you so much more leverage and
haggling online cause you can go and look

590
00:36:48,751 --> 00:36:52,170
at the room and physically
leave, uh, if the,

591
00:36:52,171 --> 00:36:54,870
if the owner doesn't give you a
price that you're, that you're into.

592
00:36:55,590 --> 00:37:00,360
And so these days it has become so
convenient. Not always a bad thing,

593
00:37:00,361 --> 00:37:04,680
but it has become so convenient that
people just assume that the best deals to

594
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:06,210
be had are the ones online.

595
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:09,750
And then pretty soon you've locked in
your traveling for six weeks and you know

596
00:37:09,751 --> 00:37:12,060
where you're sleeping
every night in advance.

597
00:37:12,061 --> 00:37:16,560
And it really compromises the flexibility
of travel and the serendipity of being

598
00:37:16,561 --> 00:37:21,060
inspired by a place and thinking, I'm
going to stay here for a few days. Or Wow,

599
00:37:21,061 --> 00:37:24,030
I just met this traveler who told me
about this great place up in the mountains

600
00:37:24,031 --> 00:37:26,760
and I'm not going to go to Varanasi.

601
00:37:26,761 --> 00:37:29,280
I'm going to go up into the
Himalayas and spend my time there.

602
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:35,540
This technologically enhanced micro
managing cuts into that serendipity in a

603
00:37:36,331 --> 00:37:39,840
certain way. And, and it also
connects us to home and, and again,

604
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:41,110
it's a two edge thing.
Um,

605
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:45,120
social media and the constant connectivity
that comes with smart phones for

606
00:37:45,121 --> 00:37:48,870
example, allows us to really find
things that we couldn't find before.

607
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:53,870
But it cuts into the idea of wandering
around and finding things by surprise,

608
00:37:54,061 --> 00:37:55,740
finding things organically and letting,

609
00:37:56,070 --> 00:38:01,070
letting it get destination reveal itself
to us on his own terms instead of sort

610
00:38:01,591 --> 00:38:05,330
of finding that place as a
consumer before we get there. Um,

611
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:09,210
and a lot of technologies have eliminated
things like loneliness and boredom,

612
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:14,970
which sounds good and is good to a certain
extent, but loneliness and boredom, um,

613
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,880
can lead you to those moments that,

614
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:20,250
that sort of force you into
a new version of yourself.

615
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:23,700
They force you to be more extroverted
day. Totally agreed. Totally agreed.

616
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:27,150
They force you to read the local
newspaper instead of, you know,

617
00:38:27,151 --> 00:38:31,230
looking through your Facebook
feed. Right. Uh, uh, and so that's,

618
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:36,130
that is what we're up against with
this technological, these advances.

619
00:38:36,131 --> 00:38:39,740
And I don't want to be the grumpy older
traveler because I remember being being

620
00:38:39,741 --> 00:38:41,340
20 and listening to these,
you know,

621
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,760
baby boom era hippie sort of lectured
me on how travel used to be, you know,

622
00:38:45,761 --> 00:38:49,150
back at a time when telephone answering
machines and credit cards were seen as

623
00:38:49,151 --> 00:38:52,510
this decadent form of technology. Um, and,

624
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:56,590
and so I know that there are younger
travelers who don't know anything but the

625
00:38:56,591 --> 00:38:59,000
constant conductivity of travel.
Um,

626
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:03,130
but unplugging is important and we can
talk more about that if, if you want.

627
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:08,020
Um, and we can also talk about the pluses
and there I have many recent examples

628
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:11,500
about how technology has have helped
this recent home home exchange.

629
00:39:11,501 --> 00:39:13,450
It's just a long time friend
who lives in Brooklyn.

630
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:15,910
She's a writer and she
wants a quiet place.

631
00:39:15,911 --> 00:39:20,911
I have 30 acres in Kansas and so I get
an awesome pad in Brooklyn for a week and

632
00:39:20,981 --> 00:39:24,820
she gets a quiet farm in
Kansas for a time. And, uh,

633
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:29,470
the positives you mentioned or
alluded to, the positives? Um,

634
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:34,050
I I definitely want to delve into the
importance of, of disconnecting. Ah,

635
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:39,460
yeah. I think I've become somewhat, uh,
especially living in silicon valley, but,

636
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:42,940
um, have some thoughts there as
well. But what would you say,

637
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:47,820
how would you expand on the,
the recent positive, uh,

638
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:51,010
positives are positive examples.
Yeah.

639
00:39:51,011 --> 00:39:55,360
Well you mentioned a Airbnb
and couch surfing. Uh,

640
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:58,990
I think in place and more expensive
places like Europe, you know,

641
00:39:58,991 --> 00:40:00,910
the hostel was your go to,

642
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,320
it was where if you wanted to save
money and you would go to the,

643
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:08,230
to the youth hostel, um, and it
was a great place to meet people.

644
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:10,490
You get a cheap bed, you went, you,

645
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:13,450
you would forego a few amenities that
you would hang out in the hostel. Well,

646
00:40:13,451 --> 00:40:16,630
I went to Amsterdam, uh,
this summer, uh, I teach,

647
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:20,200
I teach a writing course in Paris every
summer and my sister and my nephew came

648
00:40:20,201 --> 00:40:22,600
and visited me and we
wanted to go see Amsterdam.

649
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:25,390
And using Airbnb,

650
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:28,420
I was able to get a full cottage,

651
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:33,930
a 15 minute train ride outside of central
Amsterdam for about half the price as

652
00:40:34,601 --> 00:40:38,050
a hostel for three people
in the center of Amsterdam.

653
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,500
So instead of staying at, at
at somewhat grungy, hostile,

654
00:40:41,501 --> 00:40:43,480
and the red light district,
um,

655
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:47,160
we were staying in this little
town filled with windmills, uh,

656
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:50,380
and we had our own house to ourselves and
we could just walk down the street and

657
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:54,520
get groceries.
And so that was an airbnb hookup.

658
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:58,490
Couchsurfing is a similar,
has similar benefits. Uh, it,

659
00:40:58,491 --> 00:41:03,010
it just allows you to break out of not
only that old hotel set of assumptions,

660
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:05,650
but also out of the hostel
instead of assumptions.

661
00:41:05,651 --> 00:41:08,830
The idea that the cheapest option in
any place is going to be a hostile,

662
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:12,900
especially traveling in groups. For the
three of us, if I had been alone, maybe I,

663
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,750
maybe the cottage, we wouldn't
have been as cheap as the hostel,

664
00:41:15,751 --> 00:41:19,640
but with three of us where you're
getting hostile one bit at a time, um,

665
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:23,980
we just got the perfect place
to stay through airbnb. Uh,

666
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:27,850
and so those services
and even social media,

667
00:41:27,851 --> 00:41:30,010
even going on Facebook or Twitter and,

668
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:33,890
and I'm not a big believer
of tweeting while you travel,

669
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:38,120
I think that that really puts you into
this whole mindset and it pulls you out

670
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:41,120
of the place where you are and the point
of travel is experiencing what's before

671
00:41:41,121 --> 00:41:43,790
your eyes and not what's coming
across your social media feed.

672
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:48,140
But before your travel, before once
travels. I'm a big fan of throwing,

673
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:51,520
throwing out a tweet or Facebook
post that says, Hey, look, I'm,

674
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,870
I'm going to be in this place.
What are some suggestions?

675
00:41:54,610 --> 00:41:59,310
And that is something that
didn't exist 10 years ago, uh,

676
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:04,420
and is not tied to a business or social
networking thing like Airbnb and couch

677
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,673
surfing.

678
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:10,280
But it could just be that your buddy from
high school has a friend who's in the

679
00:42:10,281 --> 00:42:14,240
military in Germany and they have an ex
girlfriend who lives in Stockholm and

680
00:42:14,241 --> 00:42:18,500
suddenly you have a place to stay,
uh, through very random circumstances.

681
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:20,330
And so that kind of,
it's,

682
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:24,620
it's the old model of sitting
in the hostel or sitting
in a guest house or a bar.

683
00:42:24,621 --> 00:42:25,970
And an exotic part of the world,

684
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:29,660
talking to the six travelers who are
there with you and them giving you advice

685
00:42:29,661 --> 00:42:31,310
on points further down the road.

686
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:35,270
That principle has been taken to
social media and through networking.

687
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:40,250
That's another way that technology has
allowed that, that that old hostel room,

688
00:42:40,251 --> 00:42:41,690
it's actually killed the,

689
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,570
the literal hostel room where people
are now staring at their phones in the

690
00:42:44,571 --> 00:42:46,090
hostel room.
But is it,

691
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:50,420
has expanded the virtual hostel room
where instead of talking to the six travel

692
00:42:50,421 --> 00:42:52,160
or is your width physically,

693
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:56,240
you can be talking to 600 travelers
through your networks who might have some

694
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:57,320
good advice for you?

695
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:03,620
No. Agreed. And the, to touch
on the disconnection point,

696
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:07,540
uh, I think that, uh,

697
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:11,540
I think that social media and
being online while traveling,

698
00:43:11,541 --> 00:43:15,680
if the objective of travel is to,
uh,

699
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,230
gain some introspection,

700
00:43:18,231 --> 00:43:23,231
have unique experiences and come back
better than when you left in some way,

701
00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:28,820
uh, is very dangerous. Uh, and at
least speaking for me personally,

702
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:29,750
uh,

703
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:34,680
the laptop is a portal to many
different things and it's,

704
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:35,990
it's very common,

705
00:43:35,991 --> 00:43:40,880
at least for if I'm speaking from my
personal experience and looking at many of

706
00:43:40,881 --> 00:43:42,410
my friends whose,

707
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:46,760
whose professional lives
are based on computers.

708
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:49,280
They look at a laptop that
look at their smartphone,

709
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:53,290
they look at their desktop
computer for work, which is most,

710
00:43:53,310 --> 00:43:56,030
the vast majority of them, uh, who were,

711
00:43:56,060 --> 00:44:01,060
who were managing email using base
camp or other online services to manage

712
00:44:01,251 --> 00:44:03,750
business. It is, it is a, uh,

713
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:08,790
it's very easy to use Twitter or Facebook
socially is a gateway drug and you're

714
00:44:10,461 --> 00:44:14,510
only one tab away from, from,
from going right back into your,

715
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:17,240
your old routine.
Uh,

716
00:44:17,241 --> 00:44:20,930
and it's extremely easy and seductive,
like you said,

717
00:44:20,931 --> 00:44:25,040
because of the convenience
to travel abroad. And I know
many people who do this,

718
00:44:25,041 --> 00:44:29,900
unfortunately, uh, I don't see the
point, but they will take a laptop,

719
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:30,980
go overseas,

720
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:36,020
stay at a hotel that could just as easily
be the four seasons in any major city

721
00:44:37,081 --> 00:44:41,520
in the United States. And they
come back and they really haven't.

722
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:47,040
They've changed time zones, but their
mind, their experience hasn't changed,

723
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:47,700
uh,

724
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:52,700
more than perhaps what they had
for lunch while they were abroad,

725
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:56,220
which is a real shame.
Uh, and so when, uh,

726
00:44:56,730 --> 00:45:01,290
when I've taken these, uh,
when I've taken sabbaticals,

727
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:05,130
which are typically because I feel like
I need to reassess my priorities and

728
00:45:05,131 --> 00:45:10,131
gain some perspective on things that are
hard to assess when you're down in the

729
00:45:11,671 --> 00:45:14,310
weeds, right? When you're, when
you're deflecting bullets and,

730
00:45:15,010 --> 00:45:19,410
and dodging problems and putting out
fires, looking at your email inbox,

731
00:45:19,411 --> 00:45:23,460
it's very hard to step back and look
at the larger picture of your life and

732
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:28,530
goals and whatnot. From a
30,000 foot view, uh, that,
for instance, when I went to,

733
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:33,650
I went to Bali to Indonesia for
the first time and took 30 days,

734
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:34,861
uh,

735
00:45:34,861 --> 00:45:39,861
off of computer phone and
a calendar basically to,

736
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:41,310
like you said,

737
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:46,940
move from the micromanaging of my daily
experience to the extreme opposite for

738
00:45:47,731 --> 00:45:48,271
me at least,

739
00:45:48,271 --> 00:45:53,271
which was pretty much pure
serendipity and forcing myself to,

740
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:58,540
uh, rather than feel comfortable
and convenienced, uh,

741
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:01,160
to feel as uncomfortable as possible.
Uh,

742
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:06,170
at least when you consider how
routinized life becomes this,

743
00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:10,590
even if you're, especially if you're
kind of optimizing for efficiency, right?

744
00:46:10,591 --> 00:46:14,970
It's very easy to become
trapped in systems of your
own making where you're like,

745
00:46:14,971 --> 00:46:16,850
whoa, fantastic. My per our output is,

746
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:20,790
is wonderful and doing all these new
things I'm taking on new projects and then

747
00:46:20,791 --> 00:46:24,720
you step back and you realize, wow, I
might as well just be a cyborg running,

748
00:46:25,770 --> 00:46:27,300
you know,
running in all these systems.

749
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:32,220
So this is a very long meandering
observation. But I think that, uh,

750
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:36,120
even if your only goal,
and I don't think this is a crass goal,

751
00:46:36,121 --> 00:46:40,870
but even if your only goal were to,
uh, improve your professional life, uh,

752
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,690
especially if you run your own company,

753
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:46,920
taking a month off the grid is perhaps
the best way to do it because you have to

754
00:46:46,921 --> 00:46:51,921
set up systems that will
persist after you get back.

755
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:56,040
Uh, if you're taking three
days to go to Amsterdam,

756
00:46:56,041 --> 00:46:57,540
you don't need to do that a week off.

757
00:46:57,541 --> 00:47:00,270
You can probably come back and still
rescue things, but a month off,

758
00:47:00,271 --> 00:47:04,920
completely off the grid. Um, and I was
available for emergencies via phone,

759
00:47:04,921 --> 00:47:07,830
by my assistant or other people.
Um,

760
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:13,550
they had to call the office at the Bahasa
Indonesian language school and find

761
00:47:13,741 --> 00:47:17,730
their way to me. Um, you
really have to I think,

762
00:47:17,731 --> 00:47:21,730
think about the bigger questions that
are easy to avoid, um, by, by, uh,

763
00:47:21,870 --> 00:47:25,350
keeping your hands full with
busy work. But anyway, long,

764
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:30,310
long sort of preachy observation.
But I really think that um, you know,

765
00:47:30,311 --> 00:47:33,180
the, the less you feel you can
go without your smartphone,

766
00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:36,100
the greater the value of
going without your smartphone.

767
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:40,060
Yeah. Well this is, this
is an old conversation. Um,

768
00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:44,580
if the first person to do this in,
in the technological age was,

769
00:47:44,581 --> 00:47:48,810
was actually JP Morgan. Um,
when the Telegraph was invented,

770
00:47:49,290 --> 00:47:52,140
uh, he went to Egypt and
I forget exactly it was,

771
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:54,420
it was a little over a hundred years ago.
Uh,

772
00:47:54,421 --> 00:47:57,000
and his companions talked
about how he was in Egypt,

773
00:47:57,001 --> 00:47:59,100
but not really because he was always,

774
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:02,400
he spent his whole time in Egypt
attending to business. It was exactly,

775
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:06,360
it was like the turn of the
previous century version
of what you just explained.

776
00:48:06,361 --> 00:48:10,050
It was him in a hotel room. Um, you know,

777
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:14,910
attending to his business tech technology.
Basically the Telegraph,

778
00:48:14,911 --> 00:48:19,410
which is seems very primitive
in retrospect, um, prevented,

779
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:23,580
you know,
JP Morgan from actually being in Egypt,

780
00:48:23,581 --> 00:48:28,350
he may as well have not left home. And so
this is an old problem in, in, in fact,

781
00:48:28,351 --> 00:48:32,730
the travelers of previous generations
have complained that sailboats,

782
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:36,810
that steam ships were compromising travel
in ways that sailboats didn't isn't in,

783
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:38,670
in, in, in the Roman era. The, you know,

784
00:48:38,671 --> 00:48:41,910
the technology of Rhodes was changing
the way travel was experienced.

785
00:48:41,911 --> 00:48:45,840
George Orwell talked about how trains,
uh, we're changing the way that,

786
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:47,550
that travel was experienced in,
in trains.

787
00:48:47,551 --> 00:48:51,630
When you think about it was a technology
that allowed you to Prabal so quickly

788
00:48:51,631 --> 00:48:53,100
compared to how you previously could,

789
00:48:53,101 --> 00:48:56,610
that you could maintain a business
relationship of sorts while you were

790
00:48:56,611 --> 00:49:01,110
traveling. Um, I don't think there's,
there's a silver, silver bullet,

791
00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:06,480
um, that can keep you from being a slave
to your smartphone when you travel.

792
00:49:06,481 --> 00:49:08,160
It's hard. And as he
edit, as you mentioned,

793
00:49:08,161 --> 00:49:10,830
there's some things that
you have to maintain, um,

794
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:15,270
back home if you're traveling for
more than a couple of weeks. Um,

795
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:18,560
to an extent it's a lot
about self discipline. Uh,

796
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:21,900
there's something to be said
for physically not taking
your smartphone with you,

797
00:49:21,901 --> 00:49:25,500
which is something I don't do when
I travel. I use the Internet, right?

798
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:30,170
Yeah, absolutely. I make it,
I make it harder so I don't
have a data plan that, uh,

799
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:33,920
that generally allows me to get
international coverage. So I can't,

800
00:49:33,921 --> 00:49:34,940
I can't use the phone.

801
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:39,230
Yeah.
And this pays off in tangible ways.

802
00:49:39,231 --> 00:49:44,231
There's been recent research that having
a vacation that is actually a vacation,

803
00:49:44,271 --> 00:49:45,520
and this isn't even about vagabonding,

804
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:48,950
this is about vacations is
important for your creative mind.

805
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:52,730
It's important for your brain that,
um,

806
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:57,940
having a cessation of obsessing on your
creative life will allow your brain to

807
00:49:58,581 --> 00:50:01,520
work in ways that will give,
that will make you more creative.

808
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:04,340
So even if you go,
if,

809
00:50:04,370 --> 00:50:07,850
if you traveled to
Amsterdam or or Bangkok or,

810
00:50:07,851 --> 00:50:12,851
or the the Andes for a week and you're
constantly attached to your smart phone,

811
00:50:13,911 --> 00:50:18,050
in some ways it could be less advantageous
to the creative life of your business

812
00:50:18,051 --> 00:50:20,300
or your career.
And if you just let go,

813
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:24,070
because if you let go of that
constant stream to the information,

814
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:28,130
the micro managing, then your brain is
working in the same that it was back home.

815
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:31,670
And part of the gifts of travel is your
brain and your emotions and everything

816
00:50:31,671 --> 00:50:34,130
is working in a new way
and your brain actually,

817
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:37,150
that obsessive part of your
brain is resting. But it's a,

818
00:50:37,170 --> 00:50:39,430
it's actually working in its own way and,

819
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:43,220
and this is actually a
scientific information the
New York Times reported on in

820
00:50:43,221 --> 00:50:47,030
about a week ago that you actually
come back if you can unplug,

821
00:50:47,031 --> 00:50:50,540
if you're going to actually immerse
yourself in a new place and turn off that

822
00:50:50,541 --> 00:50:52,220
obsessive part of Your Business Brain,

823
00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:56,870
then you can come back and your
mind will gift you with, with,

824
00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:00,830
with creative ideas and insights that it
didn't have if you had spent your whole

825
00:51:00,831 --> 00:51:05,570
time in the Andes or Amsterdam or
Bangkok obsessing on those very business

826
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:10,310
issues. Definitely. I'm sorry
you took, you took an inhale.

827
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:13,340
You feel, it sounded like
I interrupted you. W well,

828
00:51:13,341 --> 00:51:16,130
there's one more point I was going to
make is that it's sort of, it's sort of,

829
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:20,720
this ties into the idea of time,
wealth, but sometimes these days,

830
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:24,010
this new generation has a way of
stealing time wealth. Again, it's,

831
00:51:24,011 --> 00:51:27,020
it's not that new, I mean,
Plato complained about that,

832
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:31,820
that written literacy was ruining people's
ability to memorize poetry. Right.

833
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:34,580
Um,
but now this technology is so,

834
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:38,750
is so immersed in our lives that we
can steal our own tongue wealth by,

835
00:51:38,751 --> 00:51:43,340
by being hooked into virtual experiences
into our social media feeds instead of

836
00:51:43,341 --> 00:51:46,820
the experiences that are before
us. Um, you used a great phrase,

837
00:51:46,821 --> 00:51:50,110
which is optimizing for efficiency and
just think if you're going to sit down

838
00:51:50,111 --> 00:51:51,830
and do it in Italian meal in Italy,

839
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:54,590
are you going to want to optimize
that meal for efficiency?

840
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,750
If you're going to hike for a week in,
in,

841
00:51:57,751 --> 00:51:59,750
in the Andes and the Machu Picchu reason,

842
00:51:59,751 --> 00:52:03,590
are you going to want to make sure that
that hike is optimized for efficiency if

843
00:52:03,591 --> 00:52:07,460
you're going to be sitting on a beach,
you know, in, in, in Thailand or Brazil,

844
00:52:07,461 --> 00:52:11,150
or are you going to want to optimize
that, um, experience for efficiency.

845
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:16,100
I think that that Italian meal metaphor
can apply to so much of travel that of

846
00:52:16,101 --> 00:52:17,720
course you don't want to
make it more efficient.

847
00:52:17,721 --> 00:52:22,710
You want to savor every bit of it. You
want to be you. We want to be, you know,

848
00:52:22,790 --> 00:52:26,390
eating tomatoes that were in the
ground two nights before. And,

849
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:30,950
and having just these very sensual,
tactile experiences,

850
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:36,650
not just in not just food experiences,
but just ideas of the unexpected,

851
00:52:36,651 --> 00:52:40,880
of, of unplugging yourself from the life
that you can predict the life that you

852
00:52:40,881 --> 00:52:45,740
could consume and buy and stumbling into
experiences that catch you by complete

853
00:52:45,741 --> 00:52:50,480
surprise. And I don't want to overuse
the idea, uh, the word super serendipity,

854
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:55,270
but it's something that is at
risk when we can unplug. And,

855
00:52:55,350 --> 00:52:59,420
and the gifts of serendipity,
um, are not just, you know,

856
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:03,380
actually you can stumble into a bad
experience is as easily as you can stumble

857
00:53:03,381 --> 00:53:05,350
into a good experience. But it's, it's,

858
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:10,400
it's admissive ventures or the unexpected
good experiences that actually change

859
00:53:10,641 --> 00:53:11,960
you, you know, to,

860
00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:16,640
to the core of your being in a way that
those preplanned experiences don't.

861
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:18,500
And so if you can't unplug,

862
00:53:18,530 --> 00:53:21,860
you're robbing yourself of that
aspect of your time wealth. You're,

863
00:53:21,861 --> 00:53:23,960
you're making Tito extend this metaphor.

864
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:27,840
You're making optimized efficiency out of,
at an Italian meal,

865
00:53:28,890 --> 00:53:32,580
every sense of the word. Um, and
it's hard to break away from.

866
00:53:32,581 --> 00:53:35,100
But in the vagabonding sense,
it's essential. You're, you know,

867
00:53:35,101 --> 00:53:37,770
you're going to be selling
yourself short if you can,

868
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:41,610
if you can't stop micromanaging
and optimizing for efficiency.

869
00:53:41,611 --> 00:53:45,240
And the more you think about those phrases
in the context of the best parts of

870
00:53:45,241 --> 00:53:50,180
travel, um, the, the more you realize
that you really have to throw,

871
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:51,330
you know,
the jargon,

872
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:55,680
the efficiency jargon of daily life out
the window and just throw yourself open

873
00:53:55,681 --> 00:53:56,790
to the travel experience.

874
00:53:57,580 --> 00:53:59,200
Definitely. And what you, just,

875
00:53:59,201 --> 00:54:03,070
one thing that I think about a lot and
part of my motivation for traveling

876
00:54:03,071 --> 00:54:03,904
oftentimes,

877
00:54:04,150 --> 00:54:08,830
and you don't have to travel a
over overseas to achieve this,

878
00:54:08,831 --> 00:54:13,690
but I find the, the, the change of
scenery to be very helpful for resetting,

879
00:54:14,310 --> 00:54:19,220
um, is to focus on appreciation as
opposed to achievement. And I'm,

880
00:54:19,221 --> 00:54:24,220
I'm very type A,
always have been and it's competitive.

881
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:28,720
Uh, and then those can sometimes
really reinforce themselves in, uh,

882
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:33,670
in good but often
destructive ways. And, uh,

883
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:37,960
when I go abroad, I think food is a
fantastic lens, actually use, not,

884
00:54:37,961 --> 00:54:38,890
not just metaphorically,

885
00:54:38,891 --> 00:54:43,150
but to really focus on slow,

886
00:54:43,210 --> 00:54:47,320
long meals is, I think one of the
greatest gifts you can give yourself.

887
00:54:47,650 --> 00:54:52,570
And that was one of the, one of the
experiences that I brought back after my,

888
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:55,330
my nine months in Argentina,
which was supposed to be four weeks.

889
00:54:55,330 --> 00:54:57,660
As these things often turn out, um, with,

890
00:54:57,710 --> 00:55:02,260
with the really long dinners, you
know, a couple of bottles, wine,

891
00:55:02,261 --> 00:55:03,490
a bunch of friends,

892
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:08,770
of course they have the Benicia and
the incredible meets of, of Argentina.

893
00:55:08,771 --> 00:55:10,200
But,
uh,

894
00:55:10,570 --> 00:55:13,780
putting aside the fact that they're
famous in South America for being

895
00:55:13,781 --> 00:55:18,220
unproductive, uh, putting that aside,
uh, the, the long meals, uh, with,

896
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:22,570
with larger groups of
friends was something that I
brought back with me to the u

897
00:55:22,571 --> 00:55:26,740
s and that I try to do at least once
a week or once every two weeks. Uh,

898
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:27,610
the,

899
00:55:27,610 --> 00:55:32,610
the other observation I wanted to
make for folks because I really was,

900
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:37,000
well, no forget, was I think
once, once a computer addict,

901
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:41,740
always a computer addict just to kind
of borrow from Aa and once an addict,

902
00:55:41,741 --> 00:55:43,450
always an addict.
And you have to manage that.

903
00:55:43,451 --> 00:55:48,040
And I think one of the easiest ways
to manage that is to not rely on self

904
00:55:48,041 --> 00:55:52,810
discipline. What I mean by that
is when I took my, my trip, uh,

905
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,830
in 2004, which, which some people know,

906
00:55:56,860 --> 00:56:00,100
began with a one way ticket to
London and no planned itinerary,

907
00:56:00,101 --> 00:56:04,910
no plan return date. Uh, I didn't
take my laptop. I did and I knew I,

908
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:08,650
I couldn't take my laptop because
I would default to using it.

909
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:10,510
And what that meant was at the time,

910
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:14,410
and there are many different ways to
do this now, but I had go to my PC,

911
00:56:14,411 --> 00:56:17,680
installed on a computer at home,

912
00:56:18,190 --> 00:56:21,490
and if I wanted to use
my laptop so to speak,

913
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:25,450
I would have to go into
an Internet cafe at which,

914
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:29,740
which is not generally one of my
favorite experiences. It's pretty deep.

915
00:56:29,770 --> 00:56:34,210
They're usually dingy eight.
It's just not an experience I enjoy,

916
00:56:34,211 --> 00:56:35,380
which is entirely the point.

917
00:56:35,381 --> 00:56:40,381
I want it to make it inconvenient
and unpleasant to engage in a sort of

918
00:56:41,470 --> 00:56:46,060
masturbatory, a computer
use, you know? And uh,

919
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:47,900
and uh,
I think that it's,

920
00:56:47,901 --> 00:56:52,840
it's very easy to default to that because
you can always find something on the

921
00:56:52,841 --> 00:56:54,490
Internet, right? Whether it's,

922
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:59,200
and you could very easily go to Morocco
and then end up sitting on your laptop

923
00:56:59,201 --> 00:57:03,950
watching the stupidest cat videos on
youtube for hours a day. The hate,

924
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:07,120
because that's what the
Internet optimizes for.

925
00:57:07,121 --> 00:57:11,410
It optimizes for clicks and views and
everything else that can be commercialized

926
00:57:11,411 --> 00:57:13,960
generally speaking. So,
you know, don't even enter,

927
00:57:14,350 --> 00:57:17,970
don't walk through the door if you
don't want that to happen. Um, so when,

928
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:19,060
when possible,

929
00:57:19,090 --> 00:57:24,090
sort of change your environment and
remove things that facilitate bad behavior

930
00:57:24,311 --> 00:57:28,870
as opposed to trying to rely on willpower,
which I think is very,

931
00:57:28,871 --> 00:57:33,220
very fallible. Uh, the, uh,
you mentioned creativity.

932
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:37,150
And I wanted to,
to ask you about that because I really,

933
00:57:38,530 --> 00:57:42,860
really enjoy your writing. Uh, and
I, and I don't say that lightly, uh,

934
00:57:42,970 --> 00:57:44,800
not that I'm the ultimate
connoisseur in writing,

935
00:57:44,801 --> 00:57:49,030
but I think that a lot of writing is
very, very bad. And I, I, uh, I, I've,

936
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:53,380
I've loved your writing and enjoyed it
for a very long time. Thanks. Of course.

937
00:57:53,410 --> 00:57:56,500
Yeah, it's, it's had a huge
impact on my thinking and not,

938
00:57:56,530 --> 00:58:01,480
not moreover my actual behavior
and way of living. So the,

939
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:06,190
I want to talk about the, the
concept of a staycation. Uh,

940
00:58:06,790 --> 00:58:11,650
are there times, uh, for, for,

941
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:16,930
uh, creativity and let's just say
you use writing as an example. Uh,

942
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:22,200
do you find that you can replicate some
of the benefits of travel in what people

943
00:58:22,601 --> 00:58:24,310
might refer to as a staycation?

944
00:58:25,890 --> 00:58:28,730
Yes. Yeah. And this goes
back to something that,

945
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:32,330
that we were talking much earlier,
um,

946
00:58:32,730 --> 00:58:37,000
in the conversation about
decluttering emotionally. You,

947
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:38,430
you talked about the idea of a,

948
00:58:38,490 --> 00:58:42,810
I think he used the word portfolio to
describe something. Um, but I think,

949
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:45,090
I think vagabonding uh,

950
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:50,100
the principles of vagabonding
apply to life in non travel ways.

951
00:58:50,550 --> 00:58:52,300
Um, and it, it's,

952
00:58:52,370 --> 00:58:55,920
it's been used as a text
and social studies class and
it's sort of about another,

953
00:58:56,550 --> 00:58:58,260
tying into something else you
were talking about earlier,

954
00:58:58,530 --> 00:59:01,320
you were talking about something that's
sort of constitutes what some people

955
00:59:01,321 --> 00:59:02,700
call it,
the beginner's mind,

956
00:59:02,730 --> 00:59:07,730
which is part of the excitement of traffic
definitely is that we get stuck into

957
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:12,820
being experts and the, and, and online
resources allow us to be sort of Dillard,

958
00:59:12,821 --> 00:59:14,910
[inaudible] experts in
everything. You know, we can,

959
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:18,630
we can suddenly know a little bit about
everything when in fact the beginner's

960
00:59:18,631 --> 00:59:20,400
mind is,
is,

961
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:25,220
is one of the most daunting and exciting
parts of travel where you just allow

962
00:59:25,221 --> 00:59:27,380
yourself to be a child again.
And in fact,

963
00:59:27,381 --> 00:59:31,790
I have some quotes in vagabonding talking
about how you go to a new city and

964
00:59:31,850 --> 00:59:35,030
you're as dumb as a five year old, you
know, you can hardly read. You know,

965
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:39,110
you don't know why it's dangerous
to cross the street. You know,

966
00:59:39,111 --> 00:59:41,450
that this is a gift,

967
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:44,900
a of travel is that it allows you to,

968
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:47,960
to have the vulnerability
of being very young,

969
00:59:47,961 --> 00:59:52,070
but also the excitement of very being
very young and the discovery of being very

970
00:59:52,071 --> 00:59:55,010
young. And sometimes for all of
the research you do back home,

971
00:59:55,430 --> 01:00:00,020
the coolest part of showing up in, in
Bangkok or websites or, or, you know,

972
01:00:00,290 --> 01:00:04,600
Cape Town is just smelling the
place, you know, or, or, um,

973
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:07,730
or going in and into,
not into a tourist place,

974
01:00:07,731 --> 01:00:11,660
but into a supermarket and realizing
how different everything is. And it's,

975
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:16,080
it's that beginner's mind. It's, if
that wonder of childhood stuff. Um,

976
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:20,120
and that can become a, it can turn into
a cheesy metaphor, but it's a real thing.

977
01:00:20,121 --> 01:00:25,040
It's the, it's the beginner's mind
that allows you to engage in a new way.

978
01:00:25,070 --> 01:00:29,960
And so I think that ties into the
idea of creativity and the staycation,

979
01:00:29,961 --> 01:00:33,020
which is a silly word for,
for what is a great idea,

980
01:00:34,850 --> 01:00:38,690
which is taking that beginner's mind,
taking that travel mindset,

981
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:40,180
which I talked about at
the end of vagabonding,

982
01:00:40,190 --> 01:00:44,480
the idea of coming home and treating
your neighbors as exotic tribesmen back

983
01:00:44,481 --> 01:00:46,730
home.
And one thing,

984
01:00:46,790 --> 01:00:50,510
and actually one thing I'd love to talk
to you about is the idea of appreciation

985
01:00:50,511 --> 01:00:53,480
versus achievement, because there's limits
to achievement. I mean, you've been,

986
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:57,410
it's been four hour work week,
came out with seven,

987
01:00:57,430 --> 01:01:01,700
2007 yeah, seven years
ago. And I think there's,

988
01:01:02,030 --> 01:01:02,863
you know,

989
01:01:03,530 --> 01:01:07,040
there's an extent to which that ongoing
success can be as meaningless as ongoing

990
01:01:07,041 --> 01:01:08,000
lack of success,

991
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:13,400
and that you have to have a relationship
with that to realize that appreciation

992
01:01:15,471 --> 01:01:19,160
becomes more important than achievement
because there comes a point at which

993
01:01:19,161 --> 01:01:23,150
that you've achieved your goals and
now what, you know, definitely. Um,

994
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:27,080
and so I think achievement
is a linear way of thinking,

995
01:01:27,081 --> 01:01:29,780
which is very American and important.
And I'm a big believer in that.

996
01:01:29,781 --> 01:01:33,500
But appreciation is that more
eastern circular way of thinking,

997
01:01:33,770 --> 01:01:38,510
of being able to save or what you
do have and balancing that with your

998
01:01:38,511 --> 01:01:42,110
achievements and, and so, so that goes
back and ties into the creativity,

999
01:01:42,111 --> 01:01:43,460
the idea of coming back home.

1000
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:47,840
And I own a house on 30 acres of land
in Kansas and that, that's no accident.

1001
01:01:47,841 --> 01:01:50,780
I'm close to my family, but
it's also really, really cheap.

1002
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:56,090
And instead of letting it in a fashionable
part of a big city, I can, I mean,

1003
01:01:56,150 --> 01:01:58,990
what's happening right now as
an example of it, I'm doing a,

1004
01:01:59,390 --> 01:02:01,440
I'm going to go live in
Brooklyn for a week and, and,

1005
01:02:01,441 --> 01:02:05,680
and do a little home exchange. And
I have the option of living in, um,

1006
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:06,680
for short periods of time,

1007
01:02:06,681 --> 01:02:10,700
anywhere while at the same time saving
money and really building a relationship

1008
01:02:10,701 --> 01:02:15,440
to a place which is my quiet 30 acres
in a sparsely populated part of north

1009
01:02:15,441 --> 01:02:19,500
central Kansas. And I am
extraordinarily creative there. Um,

1010
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:21,210
not just because it's quiet,

1011
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:25,830
but because I can have sort of
a quieter sense of discovery,

1012
01:02:25,831 --> 01:02:29,910
sort of a walking space, neighbors
pay sense of discovery, uh,

1013
01:02:29,911 --> 01:02:33,060
in the place where I live. Um, Eh,

1014
01:02:33,090 --> 01:02:36,300
this is another one of those silver
bullet things you were talking about. Um,

1015
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:38,460
how you enjoyed my writing.
Um,

1016
01:02:38,790 --> 01:02:41,880
and it is so tortured
sometimes to write well,

1017
01:02:41,970 --> 01:02:43,920
you know,
that you're very familiar,

1018
01:02:44,870 --> 01:02:47,630
beautiful, smooth reading, logical,

1019
01:02:47,631 --> 01:02:52,220
inspirational paragraph with pros
is the process of a day of labor and

1020
01:02:52,221 --> 01:02:55,730
self-loathing.
So I just,

1021
01:02:55,731 --> 01:02:59,480
because I have this wonderful
place to write and, and uh, that I,

1022
01:02:59,481 --> 01:03:02,330
that my increased
creativity is enhanced by,

1023
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:05,540
by marrying my travel mindset to my home.

1024
01:03:05,810 --> 01:03:10,810
Doesn't mean that I just am sitting at
my desk laughing and glee with my glass

1025
01:03:11,241 --> 01:03:15,290
of wine writing brilliant per
pros. Um, it doesn't get easier,

1026
01:03:16,670 --> 01:03:17,880
you know,
I guess it,

1027
01:03:17,930 --> 01:03:22,930
it enables that creative pro enables
that tortured process to be fruitful,

1028
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:28,040
um, in a way that, that
perhaps it wouldn't have
been otherwise. I don't know.

1029
01:03:28,190 --> 01:03:29,870
I don't know.
I know that you have a very,

1030
01:03:30,230 --> 01:03:32,750
Annie Dillard said that his
schedule is a net for catching days.

1031
01:03:32,751 --> 01:03:33,531
And I think that you,

1032
01:03:33,531 --> 01:03:38,150
you're a believer in being
very disciplined about
having a writing schedule.

1033
01:03:38,390 --> 01:03:41,180
I'm not very disciplined,
but somehow it works anyway.

1034
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:42,833
Well,
just,

1035
01:03:43,140 --> 01:03:46,540
just because I'm a believer doesn't mean
that my fantastic practitioner. Right?

1036
01:03:49,290 --> 01:03:49,891
But,
uh,

1037
01:03:49,891 --> 01:03:54,891
I think for folks who are wondering
what it's like to be a writer for most

1038
01:03:55,261 --> 01:03:55,591
people,

1039
01:03:55,591 --> 01:04:00,591
now I should maybe caveat that with the
observation that I ha I have extreme

1040
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:07,640
jealousy slash anger sometimes towards
extremely good journalists who have daily

1041
01:04:08,281 --> 01:04:12,900
or weekly deadlines because,
um, many of them, uh,

1042
01:04:12,930 --> 01:04:15,780
to my, to my great upset, uh,

1043
01:04:15,870 --> 01:04:18,890
disagree that writer's block even exists.
And the say,

1044
01:04:18,891 --> 01:04:20,580
I don't have the luxury of writer's block.

1045
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:24,960
I need to kick out 1500 words a day
and they're exceptionally good at it.

1046
01:04:24,961 --> 01:04:29,961
And it's just infuriating because my
experience with writing is number one,

1047
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:33,590
it has not gotten easier. Uh,
generally people ask me like, oh,

1048
01:04:33,591 --> 01:04:35,970
well after the third book, you know, it
must just get easier to use. I'm like,

1049
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,940
actually, it just gets harder
and harder because I have to,

1050
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:44,010
I feel like I have to ensure that I'm
not repeating myself. Uh, but the, uh,

1051
01:04:44,210 --> 01:04:44,861
the,
the,

1052
01:04:44,861 --> 01:04:49,861
the most accurate sort of portrayal of
my experience of writing is a adaptation.

1053
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:56,400
And Oh my God. And uh, and uh, I actually,

1054
01:04:56,401 --> 01:05:00,880
I think Nicholas cage is
amazing in it. Um, but, uh, the
movie, the movie is weird. I,

1055
01:05:00,881 --> 01:05:04,230
I read the screenplay first, but just
the idea that you sit down, you're like,

1056
01:05:04,231 --> 01:05:06,960
okay, I'm going to do this. I'm going
to do this. And you're like, no, God,

1057
01:05:06,961 --> 01:05:10,110
I should really wash my face. You know,
like, I should just, she did a donut.

1058
01:05:10,111 --> 01:05:14,360
I need to relax before I start writing to
all of these, like, you will at least I,

1059
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:18,880
you know, I'm rand, I can't, I can never
really, I don't know if it's iron or, and,

1060
01:05:18,881 --> 01:05:22,450
but anyway, let's just say I'm Ren,
uh, had a book called how to write,

1061
01:05:22,510 --> 01:05:23,950
I think it was,
how to write nonfiction.

1062
01:05:24,070 --> 01:05:27,730
And there was a portion
called the white tennis shoes.

1063
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:32,440
And I remember the white tennis shoes
is a refers to the fact that if you sit

1064
01:05:32,441 --> 01:05:35,710
down to write and there's a pair of white
tennis shoes with a little blemish on

1065
01:05:35,711 --> 01:05:38,740
it, you will, you will convince
yourself that you need to,

1066
01:05:39,010 --> 01:05:41,200
you need to clean those shoes before you,
right.

1067
01:05:41,590 --> 01:05:45,430
And that a writer will do anything
to avoid writing. Uh, so that's,

1068
01:05:45,431 --> 01:05:48,960
that's my general
experience. I feel like a, a,

1069
01:05:48,961 --> 01:05:53,440
a schedule or at least a plan helps too.

1070
01:05:53,470 --> 01:05:57,220
Even if you don't fulfill that
plan. For me it's, it's done.

1071
01:05:57,221 --> 01:06:00,130
I think this is actually a Winston
Churchill quote where he said that, uh,

1072
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:03,310
in effect, you know, a plan is important,

1073
01:06:03,311 --> 01:06:05,860
not because you're going to follow
the plan, but for the planning itself.

1074
01:06:06,190 --> 01:06:11,190
And I find that having a plan for writing
decreases my anxiety associated with

1075
01:06:11,981 --> 01:06:16,660
writing, which helps me to write, even
if I don't execute that plan perfectly.

1076
01:06:17,170 --> 01:06:22,120
Um, but, uh, what did, what did,
what is your writing process like?

1077
01:06:22,121 --> 01:06:26,680
And I have a, you know, some,
some additional questions
about travel of course, but,

1078
01:06:26,740 --> 01:06:30,400
uh, and vagabonding I
should say rather. But what,

1079
01:06:30,401 --> 01:06:32,890
what does your writing process look like?

1080
01:06:32,891 --> 01:06:35,770
When do you typically sit
down to write and why?

1081
01:06:37,390 --> 01:06:40,720
Uh, well, it's funny that you mentioned,
uh, the Nicholas cage character,

1082
01:06:40,750 --> 01:06:44,260
character and adaptation as something
you can relate to because that's like the

1083
01:06:44,261 --> 01:06:46,840
least glamorous depiction of a
writer, you know, and you're,

1084
01:06:46,841 --> 01:06:50,170
you're going to compromise people's
romantic conception of you as a writer.

1085
01:06:52,590 --> 01:06:56,320
And, and, and, and my process
is, is possibly even worse,

1086
01:06:58,170 --> 01:07:01,960
I think, because, I don't
know, I think in, I, there's,

1087
01:07:01,990 --> 01:07:06,440
there's different neuroses attributed
to writer and, and mine, um,

1088
01:07:06,460 --> 01:07:11,460
is maybe a little bit obsessive compulsive
that sometimes I could be the guy who

1089
01:07:11,861 --> 01:07:15,220
writes two hours before breakfast
every day. And sometimes I am,

1090
01:07:15,460 --> 01:07:20,350
but sometimes I'm the guy who writes
for 14 hours. Um, and, and is,

1091
01:07:20,430 --> 01:07:24,760
is it most fruitful at our 13? Uh, and so,

1092
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:26,200
you know,
my,

1093
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:30,970
if I wrote a writer's handbook and
I teach writing and I try to instill

1094
01:07:31,540 --> 01:07:34,000
discipline and ideas of
discipline in my students,

1095
01:07:34,001 --> 01:07:36,940
cause that's important because people
can over romanticize writing and think

1096
01:07:36,941 --> 01:07:38,770
about the muse visiting them.
And in fact,

1097
01:07:38,771 --> 01:07:42,060
you need to be the one who creates
this. But in practice, I'm,

1098
01:07:42,061 --> 01:07:46,000
I'm sort of a bad example that there's
some days we're all just sort of be just

1099
01:07:46,001 --> 01:07:49,870
frustrated with myself. I'll have
my spot on the white shoes problem.

1100
01:07:49,871 --> 01:07:51,100
I actually bought the freedom APP.

1101
01:07:51,101 --> 01:07:53,290
Do you know the freedom APP that
turns off the Internet connect?

1102
01:07:53,430 --> 01:07:56,670
Oh, the freedom APP. I thought
you said the freedom map. I
was very excited. Yes. No,

1103
01:07:56,671 --> 01:07:58,140
the freedom APP is cool.
I agree.

1104
01:07:58,450 --> 01:07:59,283
Yeah.
Uh,

1105
01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:03,640
and it's just one of those things where
despite my good intentions sometimes, uh,

1106
01:08:03,641 --> 01:08:05,280
you know, my, my,

1107
01:08:05,340 --> 01:08:09,760
my monkey brain goes back to the Internet
and I just have to be my own mother

1108
01:08:10,270 --> 01:08:14,650
and discipline myself. Um, I wrote a,

1109
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:19,300
um, in 12 days earlier this month. Wow.

1110
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:22,930
And so that's an example of,
it was really,

1111
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:25,790
it was sort of a [inaudible] movie
screen play that I did for fun,

1112
01:08:25,791 --> 01:08:28,820
just because I had this
idea. And, um, I, I,

1113
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:32,450
I would compromise my happiness if I
didn't suddenly write this movie that was

1114
01:08:32,451 --> 01:08:36,860
about design, be zombies and
giant dinosaur attacks. Um,

1115
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:40,700
and I think that was almost part of
resting certain parts of my intellectual

1116
01:08:40,701 --> 01:08:43,520
brain. And it was just delightful
to write a really Popey story.

1117
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:45,470
But it was interesting.

1118
01:08:45,890 --> 01:08:49,910
It's like I keep teaching myself lessons
when I wrote something low stake when I

1119
01:08:49,911 --> 01:08:54,560
wrote a B movie, uh, you know, uh,
a monster movie earlier this month.

1120
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:58,010
Um, it gave me such an interesting
creative perspective on mine,

1121
01:08:58,070 --> 01:09:02,330
on my own processes and the importance
of just getting work out there, um,

1122
01:09:02,630 --> 01:09:05,540
that I was,
I was able to write 90 pages in 12 days,

1123
01:09:05,541 --> 01:09:10,310
where as sometimes I can be torture
portrait over a 1500 word article.

1124
01:09:10,790 --> 01:09:15,050
So I think there's something, you
know, worthy and the idea of, you know,

1125
01:09:15,051 --> 01:09:18,020
Anne Lamott's idea of shitty
first drafts of getting the word,

1126
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:21,860
the words on the page. Kurt Vonnegut
said that there's two types of writers.

1127
01:09:21,861 --> 01:09:23,680
There's supers in bachelor's,
a Superbowl.

1128
01:09:23,890 --> 01:09:26,410
I'm so glad you're bringing this
up. Yeah. Please go into this.

1129
01:09:26,590 --> 01:09:29,020
You're familiar with the concept,
but I want you to,

1130
01:09:29,021 --> 01:09:30,850
I want you to explain
it cause this is so key.

1131
01:09:31,180 --> 01:09:32,110
Yeah.
Uh,

1132
01:09:32,111 --> 01:09:35,720
well supers tend to be people who will
blast through their first draft and then

1133
01:09:35,721 --> 01:09:37,510
they'll spend days,
if not weeks,

1134
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:42,250
working on draft number two and number
13 and number 67 until they get it right.

1135
01:09:42,730 --> 01:09:46,880
Whereas bashers, um, they
go sentence by sentence, um,

1136
01:09:47,140 --> 01:09:51,220
and by the time page one has done then
paid, then paragraph one has been written,

1137
01:09:51,250 --> 01:09:55,990
rewritten 10 times. And by the time
they finish what they're working on,

1138
01:09:55,991 --> 01:10:00,430
be it 1500 words or 30,000 words,
it's pretty much done.

1139
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:05,380
They're not going to do a whole lot of
rewrites, but that process has taken,

1140
01:10:05,410 --> 01:10:09,100
you know,
20 times as long as a super we'll take,

1141
01:10:09,130 --> 01:10:13,520
and these are both legitimate
creative, um, uh, methods and,

1142
01:10:13,521 --> 01:10:17,950
and he suggests that maybe women tend to
be sweepers and men tend to be bashers.

1143
01:10:18,250 --> 01:10:22,840
And that might be statistically true. But
I've met, you know, a male supers and,

1144
01:10:22,841 --> 01:10:25,220
and female bashers.
Um,

1145
01:10:25,990 --> 01:10:30,140
and they're both creative ways.
I am a basher through

1146
01:10:30,310 --> 01:10:34,090
true. I am as well. And I think, I think
of the two, I've never been a super,

1147
01:10:34,091 --> 01:10:37,890
so I don't know how it feels,
but I have to imagine that being a basher,

1148
01:10:37,891 --> 01:10:42,891
it's just the most torturous
process of self loathing and doubt.

1149
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:46,840
I just, I, it's because there are days,
I don't know if you've experienced this,

1150
01:10:46,841 --> 01:10:49,780
but it'd be like, okay, great, I'm going
to try to knock out whatever it is,

1151
01:10:49,781 --> 01:10:54,781
a few pages and I will just agonize
over the first two paragraphs for in an

1152
01:10:56,890 --> 01:10:59,560
hour. It's, it's so god,

1153
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:03,100
it's just like gives me anxiety even
thinking about it. But yeah. Anyway,

1154
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:06,310
I apologize. Is this is serving
as a therapy session for me?

1155
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:08,470
Oh, no, it's, it's actually an,

1156
01:11:08,471 --> 01:11:11,110
and hopefully people in our
audience getting can take hardiness,

1157
01:11:11,150 --> 01:11:16,150
but it's the exact same situation that
the last third of a story or even a book

1158
01:11:17,221 --> 01:11:21,780
is the easiest to write because I have
the first two thirds to show that I'm not

1159
01:11:21,781 --> 01:11:26,280
a complete incompetent, you know,
and that I have, I in my office,

1160
01:11:26,281 --> 01:11:27,660
I have different,
you know,

1161
01:11:28,410 --> 01:11:31,870
writing awards and articles about myself
to sort of remind me that I'm not a

1162
01:11:31,871 --> 01:11:32,820
completing competent,

1163
01:11:33,330 --> 01:11:37,500
but would that blank page
that the generations of
writers have talked about is a

1164
01:11:37,501 --> 01:11:41,940
real kind of anxiety. Um, and,
and getting started. And I have a,

1165
01:11:41,941 --> 01:11:44,790
I have a really bad combination,
which is that I'm a basher,

1166
01:11:44,791 --> 01:11:47,180
but I'm also an optimist.
And I,

1167
01:11:47,190 --> 01:11:51,450
and I think that if I completely gave
way to self loathing and pessimism that I

1168
01:11:51,451 --> 01:11:54,090
would just throw something
horrible out and then,

1169
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:56,760
and then I would have
something. Um, but I'm just,

1170
01:11:57,390 --> 01:12:02,190
I just have this blank page anxiety
coupled with, with the optimism that I,

1171
01:12:02,191 --> 01:12:04,530
that I, that I, I think I can do good.

1172
01:12:04,860 --> 01:12:09,510
It just makes it that much harder
to get started because I'm a,

1173
01:12:09,511 --> 01:12:12,840
I just can't,
I know that something is going to be good,

1174
01:12:12,841 --> 01:12:17,170
but for some reason that first
step is somehow at odds with, with,

1175
01:12:17,171 --> 01:12:20,250
with my optimism. So it's,
it's a weird thing and I,

1176
01:12:20,251 --> 01:12:24,600
and I'm actually relieved to hear that
you, um, struggle with the same thing.

1177
01:12:24,830 --> 01:12:28,810
Oh yes. Struggles I think are
very, uh, generous light words,

1178
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:32,330
especially when we were
both successful authors.

1179
01:12:32,331 --> 01:12:34,760
So I think that there's something,
know, hopefully people take,

1180
01:12:34,820 --> 01:12:38,720
take some solace in that.
Uh, the, uh, I think,

1181
01:12:38,750 --> 01:12:42,560
I think matters are not
helped by the fact that I've,

1182
01:12:42,561 --> 01:12:47,561
I've tried for years to change my writing
schedule so that I get good synthesis.

1183
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:53,570
Um, I tend to differentiate
between research and,

1184
01:12:53,690 --> 01:12:58,100
and synthesis or gathering up all of my
material and then putting it into prose.

1185
01:12:58,540 --> 01:13:03,440
Uh, it doesn't help matters
that I've tried to become
a morning writer and I have

1186
01:13:03,441 --> 01:13:07,520
friends who do this for the wake up really
early and they kick out good pros in

1187
01:13:07,521 --> 01:13:09,290
the morning.
I've never been good at it.

1188
01:13:09,291 --> 01:13:14,291
So I tend to get started in the middle
of the night when it's pitch black

1189
01:13:15,291 --> 01:13:18,530
outside. And so I have those
moments of acute anxiety.

1190
01:13:19,430 --> 01:13:24,430
It's just I might as well be
in solitary confinement in a,

1191
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:26,780
you know, in a basement. Um, so I,

1192
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:29,570
that probably doesn't help my
psychological state much, but who knows,

1193
01:13:29,571 --> 01:13:32,240
maybe some good has come of
it. Uh, the, what are you,

1194
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:37,241
what are some of your favorite
books or articles on writing itself?

1195
01:13:38,830 --> 01:13:42,860
Uh, or just commentary. These could
be authors who've written about it,

1196
01:13:42,861 --> 01:13:46,960
but I'm just, uh, I'm looking for her
for things myself quite frankly. Uh,

1197
01:13:47,130 --> 01:13:50,810
to read it, you mentioned Anne Lamont. I
think bird by bird is a fantastic book.

1198
01:13:51,380 --> 01:13:53,020
Uh, but what, what uh,

1199
01:13:53,150 --> 01:13:57,020
what are some of your favorite
books or commentaries on writing?

1200
01:13:58,260 --> 01:14:01,760
Uh, what is this funny? Because
