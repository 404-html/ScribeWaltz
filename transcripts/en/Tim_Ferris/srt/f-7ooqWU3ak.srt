1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,850
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02,851 --> 00:00:06,950
I can run flat out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking. No else.

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:07,920
You posted a question.

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,440
I'm a cybernetic organism.
Living Tissue

5
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:27,020
episode is brought to you by Athletic
Greens. I get asked all the time,

6
00:00:27,021 --> 00:00:29,240
if you could only use one supplement,
what would it be?

7
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:32,150
And my answer is
inevitably Athletic Greens,

8
00:00:32,151 --> 00:00:34,640
it is your all in one
nutritional insurance.

9
00:00:34,641 --> 00:00:36,350
I recommended it in the four hour body,

10
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:40,370
did not get paid for that and I
travel with it to avoid getting sick.

11
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,400
I take it in the mornings to
ensure optimal performance.

12
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:44,870
It just covers all my basis.

13
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:48,890
If I can't get what I need through whole
food meals throughout the rest of the

14
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:53,750
day, and you can get 50 oh my
gosh, 50% off. Yes, 50% off.

15
00:00:53,751 --> 00:00:58,751

you're doing your nutritional plannings.

18
00:01:07,781 --> 00:01:11,330
So for me it just covers the basis,
takes a load off my mind,

19
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,100

athleticgreens.com forward slash Tim,

20
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:19,790
thank you for supporting the
sponsors of this show. 99 designs,

21
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:22,790
which is your one stop shop for
all things graphic design related.

22
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:27,740
I've used 99 designs for everything
from banner ads to book covers,

23
00:01:27,741 --> 00:01:31,460
including sketches and mock ups
that led to the four hour body,

24
00:01:31,461 --> 00:01:35,420
which later became number one New York
Times Number One Wall Street Journal and

25
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:36,270
the brainstorming.

26
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:39,590
A lot of it took place with designers
from around the world and here's how it

27
00:01:39,591 --> 00:01:43,790
works. Whether you need a t
shirt, a business card, a website,

28
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,370
an APP thumbnail,
whatever it might be,

29
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:50,120
you submit that project and
designers from around the world.

30
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,760
We'll send you sketches
and mock ups and designs.

31
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:56,420
You choose your favorite and you have an
original that you love or you get your

32
00:01:56,421 --> 00:01:57,110
money back.

33
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:00,890
It's that straightforward and many of you
who are listening have already used it

34
00:02:00,891 --> 00:02:03,350
and created some amazing things
that I'll be sharing in the future.

35
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,990
But in the meantime, if you want

Hello Ladies and germs,
puppies and kittens.

40
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,620
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another
episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

41
00:02:24,621 --> 00:02:29,621
it is my job to deconstruct world class
performers to tease out the routines,

42
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,660
the habits, the books, the influences,

43
00:02:32,661 --> 00:02:36,860
everything that you can use that you
can replicate from their best practices.

44
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:39,200
And this episode is a real treat.

45
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:43,580
If you love the Arnold Sports Nagger or
Jon Favreau or Matt and make episodes

46
00:02:43,581 --> 00:02:48,560
for instance, you are going to love
this one. We have a film director,

47
00:02:48,561 --> 00:02:51,560
screenwriter, producer,
cinematographer, editor, and musician.

48
00:02:51,561 --> 00:02:56,300
His name is Robert Rodriguez
and his story is so good.

49
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:59,150
While he was a student at
University of Texas at Austin,

50
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,490
he wrote the script to his first feature
film when he was sequestered into drug

51
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,880
research facility as a paid
subject in a clinical experiments.

52
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,990
So he sold his body for science so that
he could make art and that paycheck

53
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:14,350
covered the cost of shooting his film.
Now what film was that?

54
00:03:14,351 --> 00:03:15,760
The film was El Mariachi,

55
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:20,410
which went on to win the coveted audience
award at Sundance Film Festival and

56
00:03:20,411 --> 00:03:23,710
became the lowest budget movie
ever released by a major studio.

57
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,350
And he went on then of course,

58
00:03:26,351 --> 00:03:29,980
to write and produce a lot and direct
and edit and so on. A lot of films.

59
00:03:29,981 --> 00:03:33,070
And he's,
he's really a jack of all trades,

60
00:03:33,071 --> 00:03:38,071
master of many because he's had to
operate with such low budgets and be so

61
00:03:38,081 --> 00:03:41,590
resourceful. But he went on to do films
like Desperado from dusk till dawn,

62
00:03:41,591 --> 00:03:46,180
the faculty, the spykids franchise, which
was huge once upon a time in Mexico,

63
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,910
Frank Miller,
Sin City and many others.

64
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:53,970

Just go to four hour work,

66
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:03,130
week.com all spelled out forward
slash. Podcast. And one last thing,

67
00:04:03,131 --> 00:04:04,310
very important.
Uh,

68
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:08,140
Robert Rodriguez is also the founder
and chairman of El Ray network,

69
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:12,550
which is a new genre busting English
language cable network and El Rey is

70
00:04:12,551 --> 00:04:17,080
carried probably on whatever you already
have a, it's carried on Comcast, Directv,

71
00:04:17,081 --> 00:04:19,810
Time Warner cable, Cox and dish. And uh,

72
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:24,250
I have watched some of my favorite
Kung Fu flicks on that channel.

73
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,200
I've also seen all sorts of
other action films and just,

74
00:04:29,201 --> 00:04:34,150
he's a incredible gems that he has sourced
and to put on his networks to check

75
00:04:34,151 --> 00:04:37,450
it out. El Ray network.
And without further ado,

76
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,660
please enjoy this conversation
with Robert Rodriguez.

77
00:04:40,661 --> 00:04:44,290
We dig into so many
things, uh, his early days,

78
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:48,910
how he planned for low resource,
high yield movies and filmmaking,

79
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,740
what he's learned from Francis Ford,
Coppola, Tarantino, et Cetera, dark times,

80
00:04:53,741 --> 00:04:55,120
how he's overcome them.

81
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:00,010
His parenting style has exact journaling
style and method. It goes on and on.

82
00:05:00,011 --> 00:05:04,240
This, this was a real blast for me
and I hope it is for you as well.

83
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:08,410
Enjoy Robert. Welcome to the
show. Hey, how you doing man?

84
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,600
Great to finally meet you. Yeah,
it's great to finally meet.

85
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:15,690
And as I was doing homework for this
and trying to digest everything that is

86
00:05:16,901 --> 00:05:17,734
related to you,

87
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:23,110
I checked out a couple of the directors
chair episodes and I'd seen clips

88
00:05:23,111 --> 00:05:27,820
before, shorter clips, but I hadn't
sat down and really sort of, uh,

89
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:32,380
taken in three to four hours. And I
did that and I'll tell you, so I've,

90
00:05:32,381 --> 00:05:35,230
I've been not having anything
to drink for the last two weeks.

91
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:38,500
And I got about halfway
through the Francis Ford
Coppola episode and I was like,

92
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:43,510
fuck, this guy's really good
at interviewing and I had
to have a glass of wine.

93
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,440
I didn't go too crazy.

94
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:49,830
But these episodes are such a fascinating
window into the processes of these

95
00:05:51,881 --> 00:05:52,714
masters.

96
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:57,190
And I just wanted to thank you first of
all for putting them together because I

97
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:00,200
was planning on going to bed early and
I went through three hours straight.

98
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,450
And uh,
then I,

99
00:06:02,451 --> 00:06:07,190
then I woke up and I also jumped into
this meccas episode this morning,

100
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,560
which is just fascinating.
And what,

101
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:14,620
what really struck me was how
different these approaches can be.

102
00:06:14,661 --> 00:06:17,390
I mean there's so many ways
to skin the cat. And, um,

103
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,940
before I jump into
method questions though,

104
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:25,540
I wanted to ask you about your journal
and journaling because one of the

105
00:06:25,821 --> 00:06:30,821
constants and all of these interviews is
the journal over and it seems like you

106
00:06:31,101 --> 00:06:35,420
write a lot down and I have a
compulsive habit of note taking.

107
00:06:35,421 --> 00:06:38,900
I mean if shelves of notebooks,
how do you do some handwritten do right?

108
00:06:38,901 --> 00:06:41,870
I'm actually, how do you keep track of
them if you want to exit some later.

109
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,970
So that's going to be my
question for you also.

110
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:47,090
So I have a lot of handwritten notes
that I will scan and put into Evernote.

111
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:47,983
Okay,
cool.

112
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:52,990
Which will then allow character
recognition to pull things up if I want to

113
00:06:53,061 --> 00:06:55,580
search for them. So I just have to
keep my handwriting a little clean.

114
00:06:56,030 --> 00:07:01,030
But you also have really
specific in the dates,

115
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:05,090
times, places. How do you use journaling?

116
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:09,580
Journaling. Um, it's interesting
and uh, I started, you know,

117
00:07:09,581 --> 00:07:13,600
with the word processing way back, you
know, when I first started filmmaking,

118
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:17,200
the first when I sold El
Mariachi and Columbia hired me,

119
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:20,470
first thing I asked for was
an apple laptop computer,

120
00:07:20,471 --> 00:07:23,500
which was the very first one that came
out. They, no one knew what it was.

121
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,240
I was the only one on the plane with one.

122
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,570
I was riding my screenplays in and then
I would, I would continue my journal,

123
00:07:28,571 --> 00:07:33,020
which had started by handwriting
it, it really started. Um,

124
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,250
I think in college my dad
gave me a day planner,

125
00:07:36,251 --> 00:07:39,740
one of those day planners and
I started using it and I would,

126
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,370
he would write the things you're going
to do on the left side and then you would

127
00:07:42,371 --> 00:07:44,530
write what you ended up
doing that day on the right.

128
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,040
And even though I was in college,
I tried to push myself pretty hard.

129
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,040
I would look and I'd go, wow, I didn't
have very much to write about myself.

130
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:54,760
At the end of that day, I'm going to have
to give myself more things on the left.

131
00:07:54,761 --> 00:07:56,290
So I have mortar writes
stuff on the right.

132
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,660
It really made you reflect on
your day and realized I didn't,

133
00:07:58,661 --> 00:07:59,620
I didn't do much today.

134
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:03,010
And so those got really full and
I became a filmmaker right away.

135
00:08:03,011 --> 00:08:07,720
El Mariachi got made and the during the
process of El Mariachi, I remember, um,

136
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:13,420
keeping a really dense journal
because it was an experiment.

137
00:08:13,421 --> 00:08:16,960
It was really a test film and that was
during all pro, all parts of the process,

138
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,400
all parts of the process.

139
00:08:18,401 --> 00:08:20,890
Because I thought if I'm going
to go take on this endeavor,

140
00:08:20,891 --> 00:08:23,380
I know a lot of things aren't going to
work out. It's my first feature film.

141
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:26,200
No one's intended to see it.
It's really a learning experience.

142
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:29,200
I'm just going to go make it and I'm going
to be able to look back on my journal

143
00:08:29,201 --> 00:08:32,260
and see where I messed up because really
going to be a document so I wouldn't

144
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:33,070
make that mistake again.

145
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:36,820
I could go back and track why did the
exposure not work and I'd be able to go

146
00:08:36,821 --> 00:08:39,790
back and go, oh, I, I didn't
do this and I didn't do that.

147
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:44,230
It was really going to be a record of
failure rather than a a document of

148
00:08:44,231 --> 00:08:49,180
success in any way. It was really about
recording and methodology for a project,

149
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:52,960
a specific project.
And as the process went on right away,

150
00:08:52,961 --> 00:08:54,910
as I started editing it,
I kept track of that.

151
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:59,100
I sold it pretty quickly and then I
was in Hollywood and I was like, no,

152
00:08:59,101 --> 00:09:00,280
I really got something to write about.

153
00:09:00,281 --> 00:09:02,520
I was writing down all the
weird stuff that was happening.

154
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,940
Finally I decided to put out a book on
just the making of the Mariachi and I

155
00:09:05,941 --> 00:09:09,390
kept journaling from then on,
everything which was rebel without a crew,

156
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,320
rebel without a crew.

157
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,810
And I would find that you meet the
same people over and over again.

158
00:09:12,811 --> 00:09:15,900
Like I wrote down very specifics that
people that I would meet casually and

159
00:09:15,901 --> 00:09:19,020
Hollywood knowing we would run into
each other again and they ended up being

160
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,270
great collaborators 10 years later,
you know,

161
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:25,050
or showing up in things and I'd be able
to go back and read them stuff from the

162
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:27,570
early days and they would blow them away.
So when you write these down,

163
00:09:27,571 --> 00:09:30,840
for instance, don't go into computer
so I can find them and I do my year.

164
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,300
So do you do it by hand and then
input it into a computer? No,

165
00:09:33,301 --> 00:09:34,350
I do them all on the computer.

166
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:37,860
So I have a little alarm that goes off
at midnight to make sure cause in nights,

167
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,890
which leave your time and I'll write
something down because I found that even

168
00:09:40,891 --> 00:09:44,460
when I just wrote some items down I could
go back and fill them in later cause

169
00:09:44,461 --> 00:09:46,710
you would remember and it
would always would shock me.

170
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:51,030
What kept it going is when I would go
back and review the journals at how many

171
00:09:51,031 --> 00:09:52,710
life changing things happen,

172
00:09:52,711 --> 00:09:56,490
like within a weekend or things that you
thought were spread out over two years.

173
00:09:56,491 --> 00:09:59,070
We're actually Friday, Saturday,
Sunday and that Monday,

174
00:09:59,071 --> 00:10:04,050
I mean so many occurrences happened
in chunks that blow you away.

175
00:10:04,051 --> 00:10:06,930
Things that kind of define you.
And do you use a word,

176
00:10:06,931 --> 00:10:10,230
do you use a different application?
How do you can always just used word,

177
00:10:10,231 --> 00:10:13,830
cause I was the first thing I had on APP
apple laptop. They're about a thousand,

178
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,660
sometimes 1,002 thousand pages
per year. Wow. Of journals.

179
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:23,680
Few days or I'm sorry, a few
pages per night on average. Yeah,

180
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,310
few pages per hour. Sometimes
some, some hardly anything.

181
00:10:26,311 --> 00:10:28,920
Some things are bigger and sometimes
I'll clip sometimes of the cheek.

182
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:32,460
Sometimes I'll clip like reviews or
conversations I had that had been written

183
00:10:32,461 --> 00:10:35,330
down. Some rest and I'll throw them in
there too. Everything goes right in the,

184
00:10:35,331 --> 00:10:37,980
in the right date.
And so I could search by date.

185
00:10:37,981 --> 00:10:40,320
Then I can kind of cross reference stuff,
which is,

186
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:43,080
I would just say for anyone
who's a parent, it's a must.

187
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,770
It's a must because your children
and you forget everything, you know,

188
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,710
within a few years they'll forget things
that you think they should remember for

189
00:10:49,711 --> 00:10:52,820
the rest of their lives. The Lord
remembered if three and forced and I'm an,

190
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:53,850
I'm a real family man,

191
00:10:53,851 --> 00:10:58,560
so I really love every birthday I'll go
tell my kids again because they forget

192
00:10:58,561 --> 00:11:00,930
by the next year what their
first years were like,

193
00:11:00,931 --> 00:11:04,740
cause I'll just read those journal
entries and it blows them away, you know?

194
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:09,560
Or they'll say, hey, we should go
camping again. I go camping. Oh yeah.

195
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:12,990
Remember that time we went camping and I
put the tent in the backyard and it had

196
00:11:12,991 --> 00:11:13,860
electricity going through.

197
00:11:13,861 --> 00:11:16,110
We had fans were watching Johnny
quest and we were playing.

198
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,950
I must have journal on that
and it must have video.

199
00:11:19,951 --> 00:11:23,630
So I would go year by year. I just
searched camping, camping, camping, no.

200
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:28,230
May 4th, 1999 we went
camping. Oh it's on tape.

201
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,920
25 of this particular tape.
I'd go find the tape and show it to them.

202
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,650
I've tried show him the tape.
It didn't have to go camping again.

203
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:35,491
They just relived,

204
00:11:35,491 --> 00:11:38,610
they're reliving the day we lived it and
they met and it was better than we even

205
00:11:38,611 --> 00:11:42,720
remembered. So capsulated and
stuff like that is really,

206
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:43,991
really important.

207
00:11:43,991 --> 00:11:46,950
It reminds me of something I don't
think I've ever talked about,

208
00:11:46,951 --> 00:11:51,500
but my mom, when I was 15, I
spent a year abroad in Japan,

209
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,980
was my first time overseas
and I was in Japanese school.

210
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,380
It's the only in a where's Waldo
American kid in the entire fucking, yeah,

211
00:11:57,390 --> 00:12:00,250
I think it's 5,000 student school,
Japanese family.

212
00:12:00,251 --> 00:12:02,740
And of course I assumed at the time I
was going to remember everything that

213
00:12:02,741 --> 00:12:04,450
happened,
but my mom,

214
00:12:04,451 --> 00:12:08,830
to her credit every time we had a phone
call would get off the phone and write

215
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,000
down what I had said.

216
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:13,940
And so she has this record
of my experience in Japan
that I have no record of it.

217
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:17,740
Of course. I don't remember any of it
without that kind of queuing. Yeah. Uh,

218
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,500
the part of that came through,
I read them a diary.

219
00:12:20,501 --> 00:12:23,380
My mom tried to keep if when
we're at a really though,

220
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,790
and it had very few entries,
but one of the most defining moments,

221
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:30,970
which she pushed me into a pool because
I wouldn't go jump in and she knew I

222
00:12:30,971 --> 00:12:35,290
just needed to push and I felt
totally betrayed and angry with it.

223
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:38,770
It was in there, but it had her side of
the story. And of course it was correct,

224
00:12:38,771 --> 00:12:42,160
but I wish she had written more. So I
thought, I'm going to make sure I write.

225
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:46,540
And uh, and now it's become an addiction
and that I, and it's just so necessary.

226
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:48,190
I mean,
you ask her girlfriend or your wife,

227
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:51,970
what did we do last year and your
birthday. Then remember a year goes by,

228
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:55,090
you will not remember the details.
You go back and you see the journals.

229
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:57,700
It's even better the second time you
lived it again and you realize the

230
00:12:57,701 --> 00:12:58,360
importance of it.

231
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:03,360
And when you meet someone you think might
be a recurring figure in your life or

232
00:13:04,211 --> 00:13:08,270
you meet someone who ends up
being a teacher of some type, uh,

233
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:11,380
how often do you go back and
review the notes or do you,

234
00:13:11,381 --> 00:13:15,400
is it really just in time information,
not just in case. So when you,

235
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,710
when you realize, oh my God,
I'm going to be meeting,

236
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,630
say Francis Ford Coppola
for the second time,

237
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,540
should probably go back and look at
what happened in the first meeting.

238
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:26,090
Or is it something that you proactively
review when you were sort of a,

239
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,280
it's only on a need to know cause
there's so many things you mean you're,

240
00:13:29,281 --> 00:13:30,114
you're really,

241
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:33,730
I tried to tell myself I want to be
the guy looking through the windshield,

242
00:13:33,731 --> 00:13:36,060
not the rear view mirror,
but sometimes you,

243
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,260
you can see better through the windshield
if you looked through the rear view

244
00:13:38,261 --> 00:13:41,410
mirror and look at some of
this stuff that's gone on and,

245
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,060
and seeing kind of make sense of where
your relationships are going or what

246
00:13:46,061 --> 00:13:48,040
you've learned.
And it blows me away sometimes.

247
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:50,710
I'll just go ahead and look somebody
up that I haven't, you know,

248
00:13:50,711 --> 00:13:54,320
that I'm about to meet with. Uh,
I just met with Jim Cameron, uh,

249
00:13:54,321 --> 00:13:56,200
when we had always talked like four hours.

250
00:13:56,201 --> 00:13:58,660
We hadn't seen each other
in a few years and I was,

251
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,780
and I looked up old stuff and I was like,
oh my God, do more when we did this,

252
00:14:01,781 --> 00:14:04,900
this, cause I met him 20 years ago and
we'd been friends over the years and you

253
00:14:04,901 --> 00:14:09,310
totally forgot when I went and showed him
Desperado for the first time before it

254
00:14:09,311 --> 00:14:11,020
came out just to see what he thought.

255
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,590
He's watched it in a screening room and
he gave me two though manuscripts here.

256
00:14:14,591 --> 00:14:17,590
Why, why watch your movie? You go
read a couple of my treatments.

257
00:14:17,591 --> 00:14:22,120
One of them was for Spiderman and one of
them was for Avatar. This was in 1994.

258
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:25,450
Wow. That's how long ago he had that I
have and how much that was going on in his

259
00:14:25,451 --> 00:14:26,920
head. And I thought, wow,

260
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:30,760
to keep something that was that visionary
and your head that long waiting for

261
00:14:30,761 --> 00:14:31,750
the technology to come,

262
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:36,700
those kinds of things made you realized
some of these projects I've had for 10

263
00:14:36,701 --> 00:14:39,070
years, I should go. We bring them
back up. I wonder. And I have,

264
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:44,130
I have since then dusted off something
that I'd had 15 years and sold it and now

265
00:14:45,281 --> 00:14:47,740
I've just finished a screenplay for it.
So you mentioned Jim Cameron.

266
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:52,190
I had an opportunity to,
I met him very

267
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:55,430
briefly through the x prize and
Peter Diamandis and those guys.

268
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:59,750
And as part of the experience, because
it was a fundraiser for the x prize,

269
00:14:59,751 --> 00:15:04,100
we all got staff or crew
shirts from Avatar. Right.

270
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,770
And the shirts said,
uh,

271
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:09,860
it's said something along the
lines of hope is not a strategy.

272
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:14,890
Failure's not an option. Luck
is not a factor. And Jim is,

273
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,450
is known for being very demanding.
Not in a bad way,

274
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:22,190
but I thought that shirt was
just why it spoke volumes.

275
00:15:22,191 --> 00:15:26,030
I think that in so many different ways
about sort of his process has mentality.

276
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:30,530
How do you keep morale high
when you're working with a crew?

277
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:31,970
And maybe like you said,

278
00:15:31,971 --> 00:15:35,300
you're doing like an exterior shot in
Austin and people are just suffering and

279
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:38,870
sweating fatigued.
Uh,

280
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:43,980
w w w do you have any tricks or approaches
that you use over and over again to

281
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:47,510
keep kind of morale high and
get the best out of people?

282
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:52,340
I've worked with the same crew for some
of them for 20 years and so they kind of

283
00:15:52,341 --> 00:15:55,340
know already the
philosophy I tend to have,

284
00:15:55,341 --> 00:15:58,010
and I've learned this not through
filmmaking, but through other disciplines,

285
00:15:58,011 --> 00:16:02,330
sometimes working with painters and
sculptors and musician friends. Cause uh,

286
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:05,190
what I found, it's kind of why
I do so many different jobs.

287
00:16:05,191 --> 00:16:07,700
It's because creativity is,
and job specific. I mean,

288
00:16:07,701 --> 00:16:08,750
if you know how to be creative,

289
00:16:08,751 --> 00:16:12,650
you can literally jump from job to job
with no training and do them pretty well

290
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:17,300
because the technical part of any
job is 10% 90% of that is creativity.

291
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,120
And if you already know how to be
creative, you've kind of got the battle,

292
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,920
you know, half beat, which
is you don't need to know.

293
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:24,020
You don't need to know
what note specifically.

294
00:16:24,021 --> 00:16:26,660
You're in a play when you get onstage
and do your solo. Everybody will go,

295
00:16:26,661 --> 00:16:29,710
what did you just play and you're going
to go, I don't know. Yes, I just, to me,

296
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,520
fun that. How do you know what
you're playing? Just know.

297
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,430
I don't even know when I played. I
was like, well, it was fantastic.

298
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,390
Anybody tape it? No. That's another one
that goes up into the air. You know, ask,

299
00:16:38,391 --> 00:16:41,750
ask any of the greats, you know,
painters. I studied under a painter.

300
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,680
Sebastian Kruger went
all the way to Germany.

301
00:16:43,681 --> 00:16:46,730
He had to watch him paint to figure
out his trick. How does he do it?

302
00:16:46,731 --> 00:16:49,910
Because I tried to do what he did
and it just looked like garbage.

303
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,170
He must have a special brush.

304
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,320
You must have special paint and a
special technique and going, no,

305
00:16:54,321 --> 00:16:56,220
he's just doing,
he's talked to live mid tones,

306
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:59,690
starts knocking into my lights a little
bit on the Chin and he goes to the eye

307
00:16:59,691 --> 00:17:01,760
and I'm like, how do you know where
to go next? He goes, oh, I never know.

308
00:17:01,761 --> 00:17:06,200
It's different every time it drives me
bonkers. So how come I can't do that?

309
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,650
And I'd go sit down and suddenly
I could do it. It blows you away.

310
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:12,980
So I take those lessons back and I teach
my actors that I teach my crew that.

311
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:14,930
So just to it.
You don't need to know.

312
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:17,890
Yeah, there was some, sorry to pause,
but this is so fascinating to me. Uh,

313
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:22,530
so what clicked what, what did you, what
was the realization when you sat down,

314
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,040
you get it in your own way, thinking
that you needed to know something,

315
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:31,230
a trick or a process before it would
flow if you got out of the way,

316
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,080
it would just flow with what gives
you permission to let it flow.

317
00:17:34,081 --> 00:17:37,320
Sometimes if you take four years of
schooling are you study under somebody,

318
00:17:37,321 --> 00:17:39,390
then you've suddenly given
your permission to let it flow.

319
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:42,660
And I know you're a guy who likes to
take a shortcut in, here's the shortcut,

320
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,100
just get out of your own way,
right.

321
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,510
You just opening it up the pipe and that
creativity flows through and as soon as

322
00:17:48,511 --> 00:17:52,440
your ego in the way and you go home. But
I don't know if I know what to do next.

323
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:55,650
You've already put I in front of it and
you've already blocked it a little bit.

324
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:58,230
I did it once,
but I don't know if I can do it again.

325
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,340
It was never you the best you can be.
It's just to get out of the way.

326
00:18:02,341 --> 00:18:05,550
So it comes through. So when an actor
comes to me or a crew member, he goes,

327
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:08,670
I'm not sure I know how to play
this part or I'm not sure I know go.

328
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:11,430
That's beautiful cause the other half
is going to show up or were there,

329
00:18:11,431 --> 00:18:12,510
they say knowing is half the battle.

330
00:18:12,511 --> 00:18:14,940
I think the most important part
is the other half. Not Knowing,

331
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:18,330
not knowing what's going to happen,
but you trusted it will be there.

332
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,220
When you put the brush up to the canvas,

333
00:18:20,221 --> 00:18:23,640
it's going to know where to go and the
further you're out of the way of it,

334
00:18:23,641 --> 00:18:26,670
it'll just happen. So the trust
comes first and trust comes first.

335
00:18:26,671 --> 00:18:28,320
You have to trust first
and then it'll happen.

336
00:18:28,321 --> 00:18:31,620
And I always pointed out when it
does, you know, like I pointed out,

337
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,860
you'll see it and I'll point it out when
it's going to fall on your lap or I'll

338
00:18:34,861 --> 00:18:37,740
just call upon you to come
up with something and you
will and I'm going to point

339
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:40,290
out cause that's the magic. You just
going to be open to it. It's all attitude.

340
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:42,210
There's nothing wrong
that could ever happen.

341
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:45,340
I remember on from dusk
till dawn to film the Ex,

342
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:50,410
the special effects guys put too much
fire and explosion and the actors can run

343
00:18:51,001 --> 00:18:53,280
it out of the building and the,
it's in the movie.

344
00:18:53,281 --> 00:18:57,300
You see that the building blow up the the
bar at the end and the fireball if you

345
00:18:57,301 --> 00:18:58,590
were to continue,
but I cut away.

346
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:02,160
It just kept going and engulf the
whole set and that was the first shot.

347
00:19:02,161 --> 00:19:06,030
We still needed lots of other stuff to
shoot with him and we're like, okay,

348
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,490
everyone else is freaking out.

349
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,590
The production designer of the cry
and it was all their work. And uh,

350
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:13,710
me and my assistant director, he came
over and he goes, you think what?

351
00:19:13,711 --> 00:19:17,040
I'm thinking, yeah, it looks good
the way it is. It's all charred.

352
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,180
Let's just keep shooting and
we'll do the repair. But you know,

353
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:23,100
little pair of needs to be done for next
week and we'll shoot that exterior next

354
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,140
week, but let's just shoot
this. Just keep shooting.

355
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,560
Sometimes you use those gifts because
nothing ever goes according to plan.

356
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,990
Sometimes when I hear, you
know, new filmmakers talk,

357
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,130
they talk all down about their film.
Oh well,

358
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:36,330
nothing worked and it was a
disappointment. It's like,
oh, they don't realize it.

359
00:19:36,331 --> 00:19:39,630
That's the job. The job is that nothing
is going to work at all. And you go, well,

360
00:19:39,631 --> 00:19:44,250
how can I turn that in a way to turn it
into a positive and I get something much

361
00:19:44,251 --> 00:19:46,910
better than if I had all the time
and money in the world. Yeah.

362
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,760
And I loved those experiences
so much that I would purposely,

363
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,810
and I talked to Michael Mann about this
then in Michael Mann director's chair,

364
00:19:54,811 --> 00:19:59,811
cause we talked about Manhunter once
years ago and he tells me the story and he

365
00:20:00,181 --> 00:20:02,760
didn't have any money.
He'd fired the effects crew.

366
00:20:02,761 --> 00:20:07,200
It's some of the really cool staccato
editing was really to cover up the fact

367
00:20:07,201 --> 00:20:08,940
that they didn't have effects
that I didn't know that.

368
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:11,310
I always thought it was a
stylistic choice. He goes, no,

369
00:20:11,311 --> 00:20:12,660
it was because we didn't
have any money or time.

370
00:20:12,661 --> 00:20:15,300
And I had the commas cutting into myself
and I was throwing ketchup on the guy

371
00:20:15,301 --> 00:20:17,700
in between. And then I did
it edit like, oh my God,

372
00:20:17,701 --> 00:20:19,350
I thought that was
brilliant stylistic choice.

373
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:22,890
Oh I said I'm going to do
that for all my movies now.

374
00:20:22,891 --> 00:20:24,420
I want all of them to
not have enough money,

375
00:20:24,421 --> 00:20:27,660
not enough time so that we're forced to
be more creative because that's going to

376
00:20:27,661 --> 00:20:32,190
give it something to spark and you can't
manufacturer and people will tap it or

377
00:20:32,191 --> 00:20:34,490
they'll go, I don't know why I liked this
movie. It's kind of a weird movement.

378
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,990
There's something about it that makes
me want to watch it again and again

379
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:41,310
because it's kind of life to it. Sometimes
art is should be imperfect in a way.

380
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:44,580
The point you made just a
minute ago about creativity,

381
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:48,100
transferring from one area to the

382
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:52,790
next two seemingly unrelated skills and
areas I think is really important and I,

383
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,660
I cannot recommend highly enough that
people check out the director's chair. Uh,

384
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,400
one of the,
one of the terms that jumped out,

385
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:03,040
which you kind of mentioned in your
last example was the Gremlins, right?

386
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:04,630
And the gremlins that
you kind of turn to you.

387
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,350
How do you embrace the Gremlins and
turn them to your advantage and the,

388
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:08,561
you know,

389
00:21:08,561 --> 00:21:12,970
the example of the ending of back to
the future and how like the church tower

390
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:17,110
and all of that was because the studio
is just refuse to finance this more kind

391
00:21:17,111 --> 00:21:18,160
of spectacular ending

392
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:22,490
things that you would think that planned
for for a year were created at the last

393
00:21:22,491 --> 00:21:24,410
moment.
And I couldn't believe that myself.

394
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,910
That's why I enjoy doing those interviews.

395
00:21:25,911 --> 00:21:28,730
I truly want to know these things
cause they still blow me away.

396
00:21:28,731 --> 00:21:32,300
The creative process blows me away and
it applies to so much that even if you're

397
00:21:32,301 --> 00:21:33,610
not a director or a filmmaker,

398
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:37,970
you watched that and you see people
talking about the creativity and creative

399
00:21:37,971 --> 00:21:40,940
process and you see how it
applies to anything that you do,

400
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,120
how you raise your children, how you cook
food, how you run a business. You know,

401
00:21:44,121 --> 00:21:48,200
creativity is so much a part of that.
And when people say,

402
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:52,160
Oh you do so many things, you, you, you
musician, you're a painter, you, you know,

403
00:21:52,161 --> 00:21:56,420
you edit your, the composer, you're the
cinematographer. The editor is saying,

404
00:21:56,421 --> 00:21:59,060
you do so many different things
go, no, I only do one thing.

405
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:02,540
I live a creative life.
When you put creativity in everything,

406
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,230
everything becomes available to anything
that has creative aspect is suddenly

407
00:22:06,231 --> 00:22:09,610
years to go and do and there's no
separation between work and play. I mean,

408
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:14,570
I work quote unquote in my house.
I mean that's why I write my scripts,

409
00:22:14,571 --> 00:22:17,780
come up with my ideas while I'm playing
with my kids while I'm cooking them.

410
00:22:17,781 --> 00:22:20,060
A meal, which is a creative exercise. Art,

411
00:22:20,061 --> 00:22:23,090
you can eat and itself and then you
go upstairs and do some editing.

412
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:25,670
Do you edit a Cgu? I can already
hear the kind of the music for.

413
00:22:25,671 --> 00:22:27,590
I'll walk over to this room
and I'll do music for it.

414
00:22:27,591 --> 00:22:29,870
I mean then you go and I'm
not sure how that's character.

415
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:33,500
I'm going to get into this character said
maybe I'll paint him first and kind of

416
00:22:33,501 --> 00:22:36,980
see visually what he looks like or
musically what he sounds like and you can

417
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:41,570
work completely nonlinear that way because
you realize I can do anything I want

418
00:22:41,571 --> 00:22:45,500
because everything can be creative.
Even the business call, suddenly you go,

419
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,910
this is kind of out of my league,

420
00:22:46,911 --> 00:22:50,420
but let me have my creativity to it and
maybe that'll solve something no one

421
00:22:50,421 --> 00:22:52,460
else will be able to solve.
And sure enough,

422
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:56,360
you can always rely on creativity
to sort of win the day.

423
00:22:56,361 --> 00:22:57,500
And in a lot of areas

424
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:02,230
with say El Mariachi, I
do, I've heard numerous,

425
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:05,470
a couple of different versions
of this, uh, financing,

426
00:23:05,471 --> 00:23:10,030
but I'd love to know how you
financed it because, uh, uh,

427
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:12,460
I've heard experimental
medical procedures,

428
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,930
I've heard telling your sort
of body to science. So what,

429
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,910
how was that financed?

430
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:20,740
Yeah,
that's been one of the strangest things.

431
00:23:20,741 --> 00:23:24,550
The legend kept growing around Mariachi
and is one of the few times you'll hear

432
00:23:24,551 --> 00:23:27,480
a legend where it was all
literally true. I mean, it was, uh,

433
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,920
it was this crazy as it sounded,
but back then, you know, I mean,

434
00:23:30,921 --> 00:23:32,380
I was from a family of 10 kids.

435
00:23:32,381 --> 00:23:35,530
There was no borrowing from mom and dad
to go make a movie. This, that was on me.

436
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:39,430
Um, I was already paying my way through
school and I already had two jobs.

437
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:44,320
I had a job as a cartoonist and I had a
job working at the university and barely

438
00:23:44,321 --> 00:23:49,100
making rent tuition. So to
go make a movie, even though,

439
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:52,370
you know, people would say, oh, 7,000,
that's so cheap for a 16 millimeter movie.

440
00:23:52,371 --> 00:23:55,670
Hell yeah, you got $7,000 sticking
out of your pocket. Who has that?

441
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:59,780
So you had to kind of take down a score
and the only way you could actually go

442
00:23:59,781 --> 00:24:02,710
do a big number was to go to this.
Uh,

443
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,240
it was one of the biggest universities
in the country at the time.

444
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:08,780
They had this thing called a Pharmaco,
which was a medical research facility.

445
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:12,020
And it's only like a fourth stage where
it's already been tested many times and

446
00:24:12,021 --> 00:24:15,500
this is the final before they get FDA
approval, they're not, they're not like,

447
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:18,350
you know, mixing a couple
of things together and give
it to you and saying, okay,

448
00:24:18,351 --> 00:24:20,690
let's see if it works.
They're really kind of seeing then you,

449
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:24,870
but they need healthy young specimens
between the ages of 18 and 24 and so

450
00:24:24,871 --> 00:24:26,360
that's college students
and they all need money.

451
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:29,750
So you go in for a weekend and make 500
bucks, which we go about picking cushion.

452
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,700
I would go in there for the longer ones.

453
00:24:31,701 --> 00:24:35,510
There were like a month where you would
be paid for your time rather than your

454
00:24:35,511 --> 00:24:39,350
pain. So I'm, I now it writes grants
while I was in there and you make two,

455
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,010
2000,
$3,000 in a month.

456
00:24:43,011 --> 00:24:45,560
Real money when you're not having
to pay for food and rent anything.

457
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:48,470
Now you have to eat. You were housed
there, your house there. Yeah,

458
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:51,530
your it and you can't leave and you've
got to eat and Shit and pee at a certain

459
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:54,230
time and benefit though, right? Because
you're there covering some of your,

460
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,800
what would otherwise be expensive.
It was a great deal.

461
00:24:57,801 --> 00:24:59,740
And so I did a couple of those and uh,

462
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,670
one of them was a drug
that's on the market.

463
00:25:01,671 --> 00:25:04,280
Liberatory the cholesterol lowering drug.
That's the one I was on.

464
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:06,360
So I got to eat bacon and

465
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,190
high cholesterol diet.

466
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:14,480
I used that money to go and make the film
because I had an idea we could sell it

467
00:25:14,481 --> 00:25:17,600
for at least double of what we made it.
If we kept the budget really low,

468
00:25:17,601 --> 00:25:18,051
I didn't know.

469
00:25:18,051 --> 00:25:21,170
So I had to just make it for as little
as possible and most of that money went

470
00:25:21,171 --> 00:25:23,940
to just the film stock and I,

471
00:25:23,941 --> 00:25:25,730
and I really didn't think
anyone was going to see it.

472
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:28,310
It was really just a test film.
That's why I did it in Spanish.

473
00:25:28,311 --> 00:25:29,630
I did it for the Spanish market.

474
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:32,090
I was already had a bunch of
award winning short films,

475
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,220
but I needed to practice telling features.
So I thought,

476
00:25:34,221 --> 00:25:37,610
let me just make a bunch of features
for the Spanish market just to get some

477
00:25:37,611 --> 00:25:41,290
seasoning, do all the jobs myself
because I couldn't afford a crew in that.

478
00:25:41,291 --> 00:25:44,090
We all learned them all. If I can
sell it for twice of what I put in,

479
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,460
that's like the best film school,
I'll learn every job.

480
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:48,680
I'll do like two or three of these things,
cut them all together,

481
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:52,100
take out the best portions
and use it on my demo reel.

482
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,520
And then use the money that I
make to go make a real first film,

483
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,950
English language,
American independent film.

484
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:01,730
And the first one got released by
Columbia pictures and I was shocked. Now,

485
00:26:01,731 --> 00:26:02,564
how did that,

486
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:07,570
how did that happen and who took a
chance on you or how did you increase the

487
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:10,970
odds of that hip happening? Because
I guess it was Sundance. Is that,

488
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:13,190
was that the trigger? No, it
was already bought by Sunday,

489
00:26:13,191 --> 00:26:15,860
was already bought by Sun. So how
did that, how did that happen?

490
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:19,730
I had this crazy idea.
I had made this short film by myself.

491
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,610
It was a windup camera. It was eight
minutes long. It's called bed head.

492
00:26:22,611 --> 00:26:27,110
It's online and I utilized it to use slow
motion and all kinds of things that I

493
00:26:27,111 --> 00:26:28,310
couldn't use on a video camera.

494
00:26:28,311 --> 00:26:30,430
I really wanted to show off what I
could do with that little camera,

495
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,040
a world world war two camera. They'll
wind up ones, I mean a piece of job,

496
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:38,480
but it could do stuff that couldn't do
with video shot that put it in festivals

497
00:26:38,481 --> 00:26:40,700
and won a bunch of festivals
and I was like, wow.

498
00:26:40,701 --> 00:26:44,250
I did that all by myself
with $800 it's eight minutes.

499
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,960
If I did that times 10 I could do an 80
minute movie for $8,000 or less cause it

500
00:26:48,961 --> 00:26:51,690
would be dialogue scenes. It wouldn't be
walled wall action like that short film.

501
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:53,970
I could pat it out.
I could probably do it for five grand.

502
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:57,030
I felt like I was getting away with
something and coming up with this idea I

503
00:26:57,031 --> 00:27:00,210
think and how come no one's ever done
this before? Let me go try it this summer.

504
00:27:00,211 --> 00:27:03,330
And we try for the Spanish video market
cause they make them for like 30 grand.

505
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:07,200
But I'll guarantee no one sees it. I'll
call it El Mariachi, which is basically,

506
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:08,910
if you're going to the action section,

507
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,300
you won't buy a movie called rent
a movie called the guitar player.

508
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,960
That promises no action at all.
But I just thought, you know,

509
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,820
I had a sense of humor and I thought let
me make it kind of didn't really want

510
00:27:17,821 --> 00:27:20,640
people to see it. I just want to
be able to test out this, these,

511
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:24,180
these ideas and see if it's possible.
Shot, shot, shot, cut it, cut it, cut it,

512
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:27,840
went to sell it in la because that's
where the distributors were for those us

513
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:31,170
distributed Spanish language movies
cause he would just look at the video box

514
00:27:31,171 --> 00:27:32,910
and all the companies were
like on Wilshire Boulevard.

515
00:27:32,911 --> 00:27:37,911
So I drove up here with my friend Carlos
and the in I had was there was going to

516
00:27:38,011 --> 00:27:42,570
be a 25th anniversary of the Texas Film
Commission in Austin and a bunch of

517
00:27:42,571 --> 00:27:45,300
people from Hollywood that governor
Ann Richards was trying to invite in.

518
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:49,440
And I saw the list of people and one of
the agents from ICM called Robert Newman

519
00:27:49,441 --> 00:27:52,680
was going to be there and I thought maybe
I can try and slip on my short films.

520
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:56,490
Well the whole thing got canceled and
it fell apart. So when I was in la,

521
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:59,790
I called ICM up cold. I looked him
up in the phone book, called him up.

522
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:03,870
This was in 1992 and got an s for Robert
Newman's office and they put me right

523
00:28:03,871 --> 00:28:06,810
through, he was in new agent there.
He didn't have any directors yet.

524
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:09,720
I called up as, as an assistant and I
said, hey, can I talk to Robert Newman?

525
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:12,840
He was gonna, he was gonna come
down to this 25th anniversary thing.

526
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:15,630
And they said, oh yeah, I went up on
the phone with him. He said, yeah,

527
00:28:15,631 --> 00:28:17,760
what happened with that? I was already
to come down and go, wow, I don't know,

528
00:28:17,761 --> 00:28:19,770
but I was going to show you
my film and I'm here in town.

529
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,150
I wanted to drop off my award,

530
00:28:21,151 --> 00:28:24,780
winning each short film and a trailer
for a movie and made for $7,000 okay.

531
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,550
Drop it off. I couldn't
believe it. I dropped it off.

532
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:30,330
He called me back up the next
day. Hey, the machine ate my tape.

533
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:34,140
He actually watched it completely. I went
and made another tape, gave it to him,

534
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:37,380
waited over the weekend. And
uh, he got the call and he says,

535
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:41,790
I love the short film, but I love the
trailer to trailer for this movie.

536
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,770
The mariachi movie, it's, it's,

537
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:46,050
I mean it's like a worldclass
trailer cause I kind of,

538
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,120
I know people come and watch the
whole thing. So I was pretty,

539
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:49,050
I'm a pretty good editor.

540
00:28:49,051 --> 00:28:53,100
I cut this really snazzy trailer that
just made you want to watch the movie.

541
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:56,550
And he said, how much does it cost again?
Said 7,000 well that's pretty good.

542
00:28:56,551 --> 00:29:01,020
Most trailers costs 20 or 30 no, no,
the whole film costs. I'll come on,

543
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:04,020
I know the whole thing. I shot it. I
shot a real budget but I'm going to,

544
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,100
can I come up and talk to you?

545
00:29:05,101 --> 00:29:09,330
So he had me come up and I told him I
plan on making two or three of these,

546
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:13,860
like a trilogy of these guy with
a guitar case as just a test.

547
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:17,550
And I'm wondering what else I should
put on my demo tape because you know my

548
00:29:17,551 --> 00:29:19,080
word winning short films been doing well.

549
00:29:19,081 --> 00:29:23,420
I think it was all Kinda like a dollars
trilogy and I can get you work right now

550
00:29:23,421 --> 00:29:26,310
if this is a really cause yeah,
it's in this to the studios.

551
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:30,460
Just put subtitles on it and I'll send
it to him. So I subtitled it, send it,

552
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:34,830
and he got me a two year deal right away
at Columbia pictures. Not to remake,

553
00:29:34,831 --> 00:29:37,470
not to even release Mariachi.
Mariachi was just a calling card,

554
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:42,340
but it happened to so quick. I mean I was
really young. I was, what, 22, 23. Um,

555
00:29:42,341 --> 00:29:43,960
I really thought I was
going to make some tests,

556
00:29:43,961 --> 00:29:47,290
films first and have a chance to come
up with what my big idea was. I mean,

557
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,690
and I was in no rush.
I really wanted to be prepared.

558
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,480
I really wanted to learn every job
and really know what I was doing.

559
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:56,020
So this suddenly caught me by surprise
because now they're asking, well,

560
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:58,330
you're a filmmaker now.
And he even wrote me down as a writer,

561
00:29:58,331 --> 00:30:01,290
director and I guess a writer, director,
I guess I wrote the script. So I mean,

562
00:30:01,291 --> 00:30:04,090
I guess I'm a writer, director. I never
really thought of myself that way.

563
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:08,500
And I was suddenly this young kid plunged
into this world and I suddenly had to

564
00:30:08,501 --> 00:30:11,710
come up with a bunch of original
ideas because this was my shot. I've,

565
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:16,660
it was too quick. It goes not
prepared. So I thought, well look,

566
00:30:16,661 --> 00:30:18,820
you guys liked the Mariachi.
Why don't we just remake that?

567
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:22,220
We make it with like Antonio
Mendez in Spain and we'll,

568
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:24,850
we'll just cast it up and just read me.
They said, okay, that's a good idea,

569
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:29,160
but we want to test screen and Mariachi
first to make sure people aren't linked.

570
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:31,990
It's a downer. And when the girl gets
killed, so they made a film print,

571
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:34,420
they tested it and people
liked it the way it was.

572
00:30:34,421 --> 00:30:37,720
They decided to take it to festivals
and I completely protested. I was like,

573
00:30:37,721 --> 00:30:40,480
this is my practice from,
no one was ever supposed to see this.

574
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:44,780
Give me $2,000 put Tom Ball.
Don't put this out for the oldest.

575
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:48,490
If I knew people were going to see,
give me $2,000 I'll go reshoot half of it.

576
00:30:48,491 --> 00:30:51,880
Just knowing people were, we're going to
see it as my first film. And they say, no,

577
00:30:51,881 --> 00:30:53,380
you don't know what you
have here was very special.

578
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:58,260
And they took it out and it
went to Telluride, Toronto
and the, the head of, um,

579
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:00,050
Sundance came to me at Toronto and said,

580
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:02,680
don't show it at any more festivals and
you can bring it to Sundance and put it

581
00:31:02,681 --> 00:31:05,080
in competition because he know he
knew it would do really well there.

582
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:07,810
And it was an hour.
So I was already bought by Columbia,

583
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,010
so I was one of the few films.

584
00:31:09,011 --> 00:31:12,320
Usually it's already had a
distributor and we took it and um,

585
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:17,080
I had a great little talk
I would do before to set it
up cause I had to disclaim

586
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:19,450
why it was the way it
was. And I said, well,

587
00:31:19,451 --> 00:31:23,440
when you see the Columbia logo come on
in the front at local probably costs more

588
00:31:23,441 --> 00:31:25,960
than the whole movie when
everything you watch after that,

589
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:30,340
just know that I how I did it.
I wanted people to know how I did it.

590
00:31:30,341 --> 00:31:32,950
I really wanted to deconstruct how it
was done because I would have wanted to

591
00:31:32,951 --> 00:31:36,640
know that as a film student who felt
coming from a family of 10 kids living in

592
00:31:36,641 --> 00:31:39,480
Texas, people constantly saying,
you want to be a filmmaker? Oh,

593
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:40,330
you need to move to la.

594
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,720
They should stay where you are and come
up with something that would could be

595
00:31:43,721 --> 00:31:47,410
sold. I wanted others. I just wanted to
get on top of a mountain, tell everybody,

596
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:51,070
so I just why I put out a book and that's
why even before each screen I would

597
00:31:51,071 --> 00:31:54,820
explain how it was even possible because
I knew they would be wondering because

598
00:31:54,821 --> 00:31:57,650
nobody had really ever done it. It wasn't
that it was impossible, just nobody.

599
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:00,850
He had done it before. No one ever thought
that way. People kind of forgot that.

600
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:02,080
That's how movies really started.

601
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:05,290
It was always like a couple of guys with
a windup camera and Buster Keaton in

602
00:32:05,291 --> 00:32:07,870
front. It wasn't a business
yet. When it became a business,

603
00:32:07,871 --> 00:32:11,140
suddenly everyone had a job and you
needed 200 people because it was now an

604
00:32:11,141 --> 00:32:13,630
industry, but that's not what
the art form was originally.

605
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:16,840
It was just the manipulation of moving
images and you can do that with two

606
00:32:16,841 --> 00:32:20,740
people. One person that was a breakthrough
idea and so by Amy would tell them,

607
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:24,880
I just took stock in what I had. My
friend Carlos, he's got a ranch in Mexico.

608
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:28,000
Okay. That'll be with the bad
guys at his cousin owns a bar.

609
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:30,250
The bars was going to be
the first initial shootouts.

610
00:32:30,251 --> 00:32:33,910
We're going to be all the bad guys hanging
out. His other cousin owns a bus line.

611
00:32:33,911 --> 00:32:36,460
Okay. There'll be an action
scene with bus at some point.

612
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:40,110
Just a big action scene in the middle of
a movie with a bus. He's got a pit bull.

613
00:32:40,111 --> 00:32:42,730
Okay? He's in the movie. His other
friend had a turtle, Eve Valkyrie,

614
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:46,330
the turtles in the movie because people
will think we had an animal wrangler and

615
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,050
that also suddenly raise production value.

616
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:52,160
So I wrote everything around what we add
so that you never had to go search and

617
00:32:52,161 --> 00:32:55,310
you never had to spend anything on the
movie. That movie cost, really nothing.

618
00:32:55,311 --> 00:32:59,100
It was really just the, the fact that
I wanted to shoot it on film, um,

619
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:02,780
instead of video so that it would look
more expensive and try and tell people,

620
00:33:02,781 --> 00:33:06,280
you know, made it for 70,000 and
tried to sell it for like 70,000 set.

621
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:10,920
It ended up going to Columbia getting
released and that story really, um,

622
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:14,080
when we won Sundance,
the audience award, uh,

623
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:18,140
my acceptance speech said you're going
to get a lot more entries next year when

624
00:33:18,141 --> 00:33:21,590
people find out that this is the one
that won a movie made with no money,

625
00:33:21,591 --> 00:33:22,190
no crew,

626
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:25,070
everyone's going to pick up a camera
and started making their own movies and

627
00:33:25,071 --> 00:33:28,380
it's been flooded with entry
since then. It was really, um,

628
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:32,000
a real change in the paradigm
and it was only out of necessity.

629
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:34,520
It wasn't my big idea that it could
be done. I really just thought,

630
00:33:34,521 --> 00:33:38,360
I don't want to take anyone with me and
my best friend wanted to come help on my

631
00:33:38,361 --> 00:33:40,370
movie shoot from Mariachi.
I said Nah,

632
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:43,220
cause I got to go to Mexico
and this camera I bought it.

633
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:46,360
You know it's probably going to break
down the first day. I don't want it.

634
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:50,030
I'll jinx it if I start bringing too many
people down and I don't mind failing.

635
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:52,230
I just don't like feeling at a bunch
of other in front of a bunch of other

636
00:33:52,231 --> 00:33:54,350
people.
So when they go back and they say,

637
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:58,910
Robyn tried to make a movie for no money.
Yeah idiot, you got stranded in Mexico.

638
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:03,260
I really didn't think it would work and
I was surprised and that's the best I

639
00:34:03,261 --> 00:34:08,090
tell people is just be naive. Stay
naive, throw it away. Don't overthink it.

640
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:11,990
I didn't overthink it at all because
I would have treated it completely

641
00:34:11,991 --> 00:34:14,800
differently had I thought I would
ever even show it to anybody had,

642
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:16,790
I thought it would go to a festival
and I would have submitted,

643
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:18,410
I would spend 10 times as much.

644
00:34:18,411 --> 00:34:20,540
I would've gotten a borrowed
money and dental instead.

645
00:34:20,541 --> 00:34:23,450
It was like one take one take,
one to everything was one take.

646
00:34:23,451 --> 00:34:25,910
Even if it didn't work,
because I had the film's so expensive.

647
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
So I would go and it was a noisy
camera and it was a soundless camera.

648
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:31,460
I mean it would make so much noise.
You couldn't record sound.

649
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,060
So I had to record sound the way
you're doing right now. Right.

650
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:38,570
So it should to take, put the camera away,
get the sound out. Put the mic up close.

651
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,620
So it's for those people.
Yeah.

652
00:34:39,621 --> 00:34:41,990
We have two mikes attached
to a little recording device.

653
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:44,810
I would put the mic as close as
you have it. So I got great sound,

654
00:34:44,811 --> 00:34:49,010
but it was out of sync. But
you kind of talk in your own
rhythm. So if you say, hi,

655
00:34:49,011 --> 00:34:53,360
my name is Robert, put the camera
where you can not do the audio. Hi,

656
00:34:53,361 --> 00:34:56,420
my name is Robert. It kinds of comes,
I can pretty much get it. Let's see,

657
00:34:56,421 --> 00:34:58,700
cause I don't like rubbery lips.
If you look at Mariachi,

658
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:01,700
it's all in sync except where
it started to get out of sync.

659
00:35:01,701 --> 00:35:05,080
I cut away to the dog or I cut away to
a closeup and it created this really

660
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,400
snappy, uh, editing style.

661
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:09,740
But it was really just to get it back
and sync cause I couldn't stand that.

662
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,420
But that was the whole idea
of, you know, it's like,

663
00:35:11,421 --> 00:35:14,750
let me just try and do all these things
myself and see if we can put it together.

664
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,400
And he reminds me of Jack Ma.
I mean,

665
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:22,010
it's very consistent among these people
who seem to come out of nowhere and

666
00:35:22,011 --> 00:35:25,520
build something very big. Of course there
are exceptions, but Jack Ma of Alibaba,

667
00:35:25,521 --> 00:35:27,410
I said, you know, we had a couple
of advantages when we started.

668
00:35:27,411 --> 00:35:31,490
We had no experience,
no money and no plan.

669
00:35:31,491 --> 00:35:35,870
And so every dollar we spent, we had to
consider very, very, very carefully. Well,

670
00:35:35,871 --> 00:35:37,320
my plan was I had a really good plan.

671
00:35:37,321 --> 00:35:41,550
This was the plan was I'm going to go
shoot one take of everything because the

672
00:35:41,551 --> 00:35:45,180
film is the most expensive item. If
I just shoot two takes, you know,

673
00:35:45,181 --> 00:35:49,620
one just in case I've just doubled my
budget. So one take, I'll cut it together.

674
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,840
The stuff that I need to come reshoot,

675
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:54,960
we'll call only reshoot that
will only get those shots.

676
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:56,790
He never come back and reshoot.

677
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:59,190
By the time you get back up
there and back to Austin,

678
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:03,030
you figure out a way to cut around
things that were like not done right or a

679
00:36:03,031 --> 00:36:06,450
little slow or,
and I never came back and reshot anything.

680
00:36:06,451 --> 00:36:09,240
He ended up just working with what
you got but it, but it left me off,

681
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:13,110
got me off the hook from
being too precious is by
knowing I had that safety net,

682
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:16,800
which I never ended up using. So if
you can do that for yourself, you know,

683
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:21,330
in any area that you're in, try to just
go free with abandoned. And sometimes,

684
00:36:21,331 --> 00:36:23,730
you know, they say that for writing a book
or writing a script, just write, don't,

685
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:26,620
don't keep rereading each page and
going, oh, it's not good enough.

686
00:36:26,621 --> 00:36:29,670
And then tear it up and throw it in the
trashcan. You'll never get anywhere.

687
00:36:29,671 --> 00:36:33,030
You've got to just have get momentum
and keep going and then come back later

688
00:36:33,031 --> 00:36:34,440
with fresh eyes and look at it again.

689
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:39,480
Now that you have access to
so many resources, how do you,

690
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:45,160
what are practices you have or
principles for maintaining that scrappy,

691
00:36:45,691 --> 00:36:47,140
creative mindset, right? Because if you,

692
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:50,850
you don't have to have many constraints
if you don't want to. Yeah. At this point.

693
00:36:50,851 --> 00:36:55,440
So are there ways that you try to
simulate that or was it a couple of things

694
00:36:55,441 --> 00:36:57,720
with that? This is freedom
of limitations. You know,

695
00:36:57,721 --> 00:37:02,721
there's almost more freeing to know I
got to use only these items to turtle bar

696
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:06,210
ranch. You almost completely
free within that, you know,

697
00:37:06,211 --> 00:37:11,070
you almost can do not anything because
that would be almost too many options.

698
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,680
But you're, you're, you're
just put into a box.

699
00:37:13,681 --> 00:37:16,590
It's one of my favorite movies I did
with Quintin was called four rooms where

700
00:37:16,591 --> 00:37:19,680
they said we were all doing short films,
were all have the same criteria,

701
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:22,500
has to be set in one room,
has to be New Year's Eve,

702
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:27,780
and you have to use the bellhop.
The freedom of limitations was enormous.

703
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:31,560
I mean you watch that short and it goes
all over the room and by the end we

704
00:37:31,561 --> 00:37:32,850
burned down in the room.
I mean it's,

705
00:37:32,851 --> 00:37:37,170
it's a almost with some more exciting
to know that you were in a box and you

706
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:38,760
could be creative within that box.

707
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:41,160
So now that so many things
are available to you,

708
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:44,430
you wouldn't limit yourself in a way.
So I try to limit time.

709
00:37:44,431 --> 00:37:47,100
I try to limit money so
that we can really get,

710
00:37:47,101 --> 00:37:51,000
still keep that essence of
creativity and deliver on the screen.

711
00:37:51,001 --> 00:37:55,260
Something that just looks much bigger
so that you can retain your freedom,

712
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,870
creative freedom.
Because if you start spending more money,

713
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:02,230
suddenly the financier's, rightfully
so, the studios are, you know,

714
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:06,210
the executives will be over your shoulder
constantly questioning every move you

715
00:38:06,211 --> 00:38:10,800
make because they want their money back.
But if you keep the budget low,

716
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:13,680
it's a win win situation.
If the money to the movie does great,

717
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:16,230
it's a great success and
the movie doesn't do great,

718
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:19,080
it's still a success because it didn't
cost very much and it'll make back its

719
00:38:19,081 --> 00:38:22,080
money over time. That's kind of
where I've kind of lived and breathe.

720
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:25,020
I'm about to jump out of the box a little
bit more and do some things that are a

721
00:38:25,021 --> 00:38:27,310
little bigger just to,
just to learn more.

722
00:38:27,311 --> 00:38:30,000
You cause you just learn more when you
go and do other kinds of assignments.

723
00:38:30,001 --> 00:38:33,690
But where it's really the most
fun and that's why you asked,

724
00:38:33,691 --> 00:38:34,740
how do you keep the morale high?

725
00:38:34,741 --> 00:38:38,320
The morale always high on the set because
they know we're just being creative.

726
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:42,490
That's the name of the game. It's
not looking for a result. It's like,

727
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,190
how can we just keep
ourselves jazzed about this?

728
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:50,890
If you were to go back and rewrite a
rebel without a crew at this point,

729
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:56,720
what would you change? What would
you add? What would you remove?

730
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:59,870
No, I haven't read it
since I wrote it. Actually,

731
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:03,560
it's really funny that you
say that because the people
come up to me a lot with

732
00:39:03,561 --> 00:39:07,370
copies ready for me, like to sign it.
It's a lot of people have read it and,

733
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:11,690
and um, and they say that to help them.
And even if they weren't a filmmaker,

734
00:39:11,691 --> 00:39:15,230
you know, helped me open my own
business and help me do this. And um,

735
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,600
and they would mention a
quote and I'm thinking,

736
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:22,340
I don't remember ever saying that. I
gotta go reread it. I was smart back then.

737
00:39:22,341 --> 00:39:25,010
What happened?
I said some really good stuff.

738
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:28,650
I didn't say give me these quotes
that sounded like I got to follow the,

739
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:32,000
I need to go reread it just so I can
go follow what I used to tell myself.

740
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:33,740
Because there's something
that happens and you know,

741
00:39:33,741 --> 00:39:35,570
when you go to lecture
or when you go to teach,

742
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:38,120
it's kind of like you opening
up that pipe, you know,

743
00:39:38,121 --> 00:39:42,920
you go to talk with the intention and
it's all intention based of giving.

744
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:46,500
People who are looking for answers
and looking for strategies, uh,

745
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:49,340
something they can use and
out of your mouth will come.

746
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,390
Things that you are then
going and Caribbean and
writing down your self going,

747
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:56,680
well that's pretty good advice. Where'd
that come from? You know, that's,

748
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:59,210
cause it's like you're letting
it flow. It's not you, you know,

749
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:00,950
you've gotten out of
the way at that point.

750
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:03,890
So that book was a very much like that.
You know,

751
00:40:03,891 --> 00:40:07,340
there's a lot of things in there that
even I'm surprised popped out that seemed

752
00:40:07,341 --> 00:40:11,420
right at that time that were very knowing
without me knowing anything. You know.

753
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:13,880
So, um, I, I really do like that about it.

754
00:40:13,881 --> 00:40:15,320
I wouldn't think I
would rewrite that book,

755
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:18,530
but I'm trying to figure out is how to
write the ones after because so much

756
00:40:18,531 --> 00:40:23,531
happened after that and the diaries are
so dense that it's almost hard to know

757
00:40:24,201 --> 00:40:27,280
how to focus. I think I
figured out how to do it. Um,

758
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:32,030
by doing a creativity based book where
anytime some of these events happened to

759
00:40:32,031 --> 00:40:34,880
do, particularly with
creativity or the process,

760
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:38,300
then those things like hanging out with
Jim that time or doing this with this

761
00:40:38,301 --> 00:40:40,550
person,
what would fit into it.

762
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,910
And then you could get some of those
journal entries in a way there was organic

763
00:40:43,911 --> 00:40:47,480
to the whole creative processes. That
seems to be mostly what I'm about now.

764
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:51,140
Not specifically film related,
you know, because I would,

765
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:53,090
if film died tomorrow,

766
00:40:53,091 --> 00:40:56,090
I would be sculpting or painting or doing
music or something else that involved

767
00:40:56,091 --> 00:40:58,500
creativity. So really
what I, what I am as a,

768
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:01,970
as a creative or someone who lives a
creative life, not even just in your work,

769
00:41:01,971 --> 00:41:03,860
but it's also in when he's not working,

770
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:07,740
working. And you, you mentioned
earlier two jobs, uh, in college.

771
00:41:07,741 --> 00:41:11,170
One of them was cartooning. And
was that Los Hooligans? Yes. Okay.

772
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:12,690
So you had loose hooligans,

773
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:17,070
which then became later the name of the,
of your company,

774
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:20,860
which was changed. I've kind of
two questions. One is how did cart,

775
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:24,300
how cartooning helped you in
your various creative endeavors,

776
00:41:24,301 --> 00:41:26,860
but maybe specifically film and you know,

777
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:31,590
did you use your kind of a drawing ability
for say El Mariachi or any of these

778
00:41:31,591 --> 00:41:33,980
others? Uh, then the
second question, which we

779
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:37,900
can get to, but it's why you changed
the name to trouble maker studios. Um,

780
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,880
well but that's the first one. First
Lyssa logins. Yeah, it was, was a name.

781
00:41:40,881 --> 00:41:43,850
The these little troublemakers is about
the little kids based on my family in

782
00:41:43,851 --> 00:41:43,941
the,

783
00:41:43,941 --> 00:41:48,941
in the comic strip and a loss hooligans
was to show that there were Hispanic,

784
00:41:49,041 --> 00:41:49,990
you know,
um,

785
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:53,240
it was with the few Hispanic strips and
that through that paper was a very big

786
00:41:53,241 --> 00:41:55,860
paper and we had a big comics page,
was very popular,

787
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,730
very famous people came out
of their birthday. Brother
came out of there, Chris,

788
00:41:58,731 --> 00:42:02,530
where it was a Pulitzer prize
winning. Cartoonist, uh,

789
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:04,460
has amazing books out here.
Most of that,

790
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:07,100
it's a lot of that first early work
he did was from his college work.

791
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:10,460
I mean he is just bonkers grade and
made everyone around them. Good.

792
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:13,070
That's the other thing is if you
surround yourself with masters,

793
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,540
which is I still try to do,

794
00:42:14,541 --> 00:42:18,140
that's main trick is even when we're
filming I'll have master painters and

795
00:42:18,141 --> 00:42:22,760
master sculptors and master come visit
so the artists can just get off on what

796
00:42:22,761 --> 00:42:26,020
they're doing and apply it to their area.
Cause it's like you're,

797
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:29,960
your mind explodes and you want to always
be training and always be learning.

798
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:33,590
And um, and that's kind of
what that page was for me.

799
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:37,310
The cartooning made me realize a
lot about the creative process.

800
00:42:37,311 --> 00:42:41,510
I remember I used to come home and I'd
have to do a strip a day and it would

801
00:42:41,511 --> 00:42:42,410
take sometimes three,

802
00:42:42,411 --> 00:42:46,640
four hours and I would sometimes it does
not feel like facing the blank page.

803
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:48,150
I would go lay down and go,
I'm,

804
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:51,500
I'm trying to figure out if I can create
this method where I can just come lay

805
00:42:51,501 --> 00:42:52,071
down and stare.

806
00:42:52,071 --> 00:42:54,830
At the ceiling and it'll just appear
fully formed and then I can go and draw it

807
00:42:54,831 --> 00:42:57,800
and it never could get that to work.
I'd be running at a time,

808
00:42:57,801 --> 00:43:01,160
I'd run back to the table and I'd
realize the only way to do it is by just

809
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:01,550
drawing.

810
00:43:01,550 --> 00:43:05,030
You'd have to draw and draw and draw and
then one drawing would kind of be kind

811
00:43:05,031 --> 00:43:06,920
of funny or cool and
that was kind of neat.

812
00:43:06,921 --> 00:43:09,830
This one kind of goes with that and you
draw a couple of filler ups and that's

813
00:43:09,831 --> 00:43:10,550
how it'd be created.

814
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:14,050
You had to actually move and I
applied that to all my other work,

815
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,550
filmmaking and everything.
Even if I didn't know what to do,

816
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,250
you just had to begin. And a
lot of people, that's the star,

817
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,140
the part that keeps them back the most.
It's like,

818
00:43:21,141 --> 00:43:23,920
well I don't have an idea so I
can't start. It's like, no, you,

819
00:43:23,921 --> 00:43:27,350
you'll only get the idea once you start.
It's totally reverse thing.

820
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:30,080
You have to act first
before inspirational hit.

821
00:43:30,081 --> 00:43:33,110
You don't wait for inspiration and then
act or getting everyone to act cause

822
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:34,340
you're never going to
have the inspiration,

823
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:38,330
not consistently so you can consistently
perform and act and get there and sit

824
00:43:38,331 --> 00:43:40,970
and draw till it comes
out and it comes out.

825
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:42,770
And if you trust it and then
you get out of your way.

826
00:43:42,771 --> 00:43:46,100
And it started teaching me that too.
You don't have to ever sit there and go,

827
00:43:46,101 --> 00:43:48,860
well I don't have any ideas.
I don't know if I can draw in a day.

828
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:53,220
Get your ego out of it.
It's not you anyway. If you
sooner you shut up to center,

829
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:54,830
it'll come through,
get out of the way,

830
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:58,100
let the pen glide where it needs to go
and it'll be there and you'll be amazed

831
00:43:58,101 --> 00:44:00,170
and you'll be going,
how did I do that?

832
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:04,100
Creative spirit will be like
pastor taking credit for it again.

833
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:08,630
But uh, that applied to that,
um, to everything that I do.

834
00:44:08,631 --> 00:44:11,540
And sometimes it helps to be able to draw,
to show somebody really quickly,

835
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:14,180
this is the shot I have in mind.
Let's go get this. And I'm,

836
00:44:14,181 --> 00:44:19,000
and I be able to sketch it out so that,
so that would help. But um, mostly, uh,

837
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:20,720
it was really just a process to create it.

838
00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:23,540
What I learned about the creative
process that early, I was like 18,

839
00:44:23,541 --> 00:44:27,030
19 at the time. Um, I'll show you
some of the strips. They're pretty,

840
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:29,090
I looked back at him and I'm
like, oh my God, I cannot,

841
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:31,920
I drew better then than I
do now or what happened.

842
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:34,260
But because I was practicing every
day and that was the other thing.

843
00:44:34,261 --> 00:44:37,890
It showed you mastery. You know, if you,
you spent four hours a day on anything,

844
00:44:37,891 --> 00:44:41,760
you're any, a brief freaking good. Even
if you haven't zero talent. I mean,

845
00:44:41,761 --> 00:44:44,900
one of the cartoon is it Chris, where
came in one day, he goes, oh my God, it's,

846
00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:45,870
my teacher told me this.

847
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:48,870
You're trying to have jumped and
leaps and bounds within a day.

848
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:52,680
It's not a gradual up. It's like
suddenly from one day to the next.

849
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:53,910
And I just saw that in years,

850
00:44:53,911 --> 00:44:57,810
I had done it strip that
was really different from
anything I did and it went to

851
00:44:57,811 --> 00:45:01,320
that level. So, um, I
apply that a lot to people,

852
00:45:01,321 --> 00:45:04,640
like don't get frustrated to keep
going, keep practicing, keep adding,

853
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:06,600
can put in the hours and
then it'll come to you.

854
00:45:06,601 --> 00:45:08,950
And then at one point
suddenly you'll beat.

855
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:12,300
And I've had it happen everywhere and
sculpting and music and film making where

856
00:45:12,301 --> 00:45:15,350
it's suddenly it's just
jumps, jumps, yeah.

857
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:18,420
At jumps by a lot and it blows you
away and you're like, what's different?

858
00:45:18,421 --> 00:45:20,760
Nothing's different. I just kept
applying myself and had finally,

859
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:25,500
and it finally clicked, troublemaker
studios came from, I had the studio,

860
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:27,420
I didn't know what to call
my production company.

861
00:45:27,421 --> 00:45:30,930
I was an independent filmmaker who was
getting to put his company in the front

862
00:45:30,931 --> 00:45:34,800
of a credits. So I had just come up
with a company. I didn't have one.

863
00:45:34,801 --> 00:45:37,260
So I just use those hooligans so people
would know it was the same guy who was

864
00:45:37,261 --> 00:45:41,070
making cartoons and then, um, but
the cinnamon was kind of cool.

865
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:42,000
I hadn't quite figured it out.

866
00:45:42,001 --> 00:45:47,001
And then one year was in 1997 I was going
to go to Europe to do some publicity

867
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:50,340
and I went into this place where Stevie
Ray Vaughan used to get his cowboy hats

868
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:53,580
and to get a cowboy hat. And I walked
into the, to their place and they said,

869
00:45:53,581 --> 00:45:56,070
I need a cowboy hat because I'm going to
Europe. And every time I go to Europe,

870
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,800
they always ask, you're from
Texas where he was a cowboy hat.

871
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,740
So I'm going to go in there this time
with a cowboy hat. It's like, guys,

872
00:46:01,790 --> 00:46:03,120
what do you got right now?

873
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:05,940
And the guy ran to the back and he
looked at me that kind of size you up.

874
00:46:05,941 --> 00:46:09,420
And they, uh, Texas hatters and they
fit something to your head and he goes,

875
00:46:09,421 --> 00:46:14,040
this is called a troublemaker.
Troublemaker. Wow, that's
a cool name for a hat.

876
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:16,660
Shit, I'm going to call my studio
that troublemakers two years.

877
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:19,510
It's kind of the same as less
hooligans, but done in a, in a, in a,

878
00:46:19,511 --> 00:46:21,870
in a really cool way. So yeah, my,

879
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:25,110
my thing of wearing a cowboy hat and
the name of his studio was born that one

880
00:46:25,111 --> 00:46:26,760
day. Well I love her, I love it.

881
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:28,130
I've,

882
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:31,610
when I've made companies like LLCs or
whatever and I'll be on the phone with the

883
00:46:31,611 --> 00:46:32,241
lawyer and they'll say,

884
00:46:32,241 --> 00:46:34,580
well what do you want to do with such
and such name isn't available and I'll

885
00:46:34,581 --> 00:46:36,740
just look around where it
happened to be sitting.

886
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:40,820
Kind of like the Kobayashi moment,
the usual suspects and I'll be like,

887
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:43,400
it's a pillow serious,
you know,

888
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:46,520
just tagging things together round
and that's all be like try that.

889
00:46:46,521 --> 00:46:47,900
No one's going to have have,
I've already read

890
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:52,950
one of my favorite LLCs and this is the
sentiment that sometimes why you go,

891
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,070
and you probably can relate to this
sometimes when you try to get help from

892
00:46:57,071 --> 00:47:01,600
people and they don't quite see the
vision. And then as a negativity involved,

893
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:05,040
one of my companies is called nevermind,
I'll do it myself productions.

894
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:09,250
And it always the motivates
people when you want to say, Hey,

895
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:12,340
can you take me this or bring
me that? And they go like, well,

896
00:47:12,341 --> 00:47:16,390
I don't know if that ain't go, never
mind, I'll do it myself. Productions like,

897
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:19,100
okay, okay, I'll go dog with it.
They don't want to be labeled that.

898
00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:20,710
It's like a great motivator.

899
00:47:21,830 --> 00:47:26,500
Uh, so speaking of, of trouble
maker, um, and just being,

900
00:47:26,501 --> 00:47:27,550
say rabble rouser,

901
00:47:27,551 --> 00:47:31,750
one of the things that I wrote down
from your conversation with Francis Ford

902
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:35,740
Coppola, who by the way, he, so he
owns a bunch of, uh, obviously he's,

903
00:47:35,741 --> 00:47:37,570
he's spends a lot of time in nor cal.
He's got,

904
00:47:37,650 --> 00:47:41,650
the winery also has some restaurants and
so everyone said I for about a year I

905
00:47:41,651 --> 00:47:45,740
was writing and I just went
to his restaurants hoping
that he would walk in. Uh,

906
00:47:45,850 --> 00:47:48,400
it was in north beach. I was
right at the corner. It'd be,

907
00:47:48,401 --> 00:47:50,230
I think he owns the entire building.
But um,

908
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:54,790
the restaurant that I went into most is
actually in Palo Alto and I'm blanking

909
00:47:54,791 --> 00:47:57,540
on the, on the name. I want to say
Blanco. It also, I thought, I thought,

910
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:58,870
I thought it was like white and red,

911
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:01,960
but I would go and I'd sit in there just
in the off chance that he would walk in.

912
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:04,870
Never. And never ended up
happening, but I never gave up hope.

913
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:05,591
And that's why I wrote,

914
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:08,380
actually I probably edited half of the
four hour work week in that restaurant.

915
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:12,040
Uh, drank way too much coffee. But one
of the things he said was, you know,

916
00:48:12,041 --> 00:48:16,810
failure is not durable. And uh, the
segue there, the next thing he said was,

917
00:48:16,811 --> 00:48:20,110
the things that they fire you for when
you're young are the same things they

918
00:48:20,111 --> 00:48:22,180
give you lifetime achievement
awards for when you're old.

919
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:24,940
And so I wanted to know what,

920
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:28,870
what did you get and how did you get
yourself in trouble in the early days?

921
00:48:28,871 --> 00:48:29,704
Were there,

922
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:34,660
were there ways that you got yourself a
sort of created friction or conflict in

923
00:48:34,661 --> 00:48:37,840
ways that you don't regret
or that you do regret?

924
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:40,930
Yeah. Oh, that was anytime you step
out of line, you know, like that,

925
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,100
but it wasn't in the g in trouble,

926
00:48:42,101 --> 00:48:45,760
but you just have people not understanding
exactly what you were going to do.

927
00:48:45,761 --> 00:48:49,420
And then with good intentions not want
you to go like down the wrong path.

928
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:52,450
So I remember one of my teachers who
became a great friend of mine, I wouldn't,

929
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:55,600
he asked me, what are you doing this
summer? I'm going to go make a movie.

930
00:48:55,790 --> 00:48:58,870
And so Mariachi the going, what are you
going to do? I'm going to go make a movie.

931
00:48:58,930 --> 00:49:03,880
Oh yeah. Who's going to be your GP? Oh,
well I'm going to be the defeat. Oh No,

932
00:49:03,881 --> 00:49:06,700
the actors will hate you. You'll be there
setting up the lights the whole time,

933
00:49:06,701 --> 00:49:07,534
you know,
right away.

934
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:10,180
So I'd tell me all the disadvantages
to try to do something yourself.

935
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:12,550
And so I just like, I'm not gonna
tell anybody what I'm gonna do.

936
00:49:12,551 --> 00:49:15,100
I'm just going to go do it because I have
a feeling it'll work and if it doesn't

937
00:49:15,101 --> 00:49:18,400
work, no one, Lou. And it worked.
When I came back and I showed him,

938
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:20,200
he felt very embarrassed,
but he goes, well, you know,

939
00:49:20,201 --> 00:49:22,840
you hate to see these kids go out there
and you know, with good intentions.

940
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:23,531
But you know,

941
00:49:23,531 --> 00:49:26,920
anytime you just did something that was
against the grain because he'd just go,

942
00:49:26,921 --> 00:49:29,440
I don't know. I have a, I have a
feeling I should just go this way.

943
00:49:29,441 --> 00:49:33,220
You should just go and
try it. And um, it's just,

944
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:37,150
it's good not to follow the
herd, you know, go the other way.

945
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:41,140
If everyone's going that way, you go this
other way. Yeah, you're going to stumble,

946
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:43,720
you're going to stumble up,
but you're also going to stumble upon,

947
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:47,050
you're going to stumble upon an idea. No
one came. So my favorite quotes, I say,

948
00:49:47,051 --> 00:49:49,430
that's great.
It's going to be my book talks.

949
00:49:49,470 --> 00:49:51,790
And people get all excited because
it's like, you're going to stumble,

950
00:49:51,791 --> 00:49:54,640
but you're going to stumble upon something
no one ever else came up with because

951
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:57,760
it's the freaking lined with gold
over there. No one goes that way.

952
00:49:57,761 --> 00:49:58,900
It hasn't been picked clean yet.

953
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:01,990
And you're going to stumble upon
something and you'll stumble a few times,

954
00:50:01,991 --> 00:50:02,824
but then you're going to,

955
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:06,160
you're going to consistently stumble upon
an idea no one's come up with by going

956
00:50:06,161 --> 00:50:10,270
that way. And so I tend to just kind
of always been that way. I was like,

957
00:50:10,271 --> 00:50:12,970
if everyone is going that way, like they
know what they're doing with purpose,

958
00:50:12,971 --> 00:50:16,120
I don't know what I'm doing,
I'm just going to go this other way.

959
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:19,420
That way at least it's a new frontier.
And I always found success that way.

960
00:50:19,630 --> 00:50:22,090
I always found success by
just going the opposite way.

961
00:50:22,091 --> 00:50:23,770
If it was too much competition over there,

962
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:26,320
if everyone is trying to get
through at one little door,

963
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:28,920
you're in the wrong
place. You know? And I,

964
00:50:28,921 --> 00:50:31,310
and I hate saying that sometimes
I a film festival and people say,

965
00:50:31,311 --> 00:50:34,430
how do we break in and go, well the
problem is you're at a film festival.

966
00:50:35,070 --> 00:50:36,140
Nothing wrong with film festival,

967
00:50:36,141 --> 00:50:40,320
but everyone else here is trying to get
through that same door and it does not

968
00:50:40,330 --> 00:50:42,680
all going to fit.
So you've got to think bigger than that.

969
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:45,730
There's less competition up there.
So instead of everyone,

970
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:47,450
I always wanted to get into TV,

971
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:50,630
but instead of going and
competing with everyone else,

972
00:50:50,631 --> 00:50:54,740
trying to get on 7:00 PM on NBC
on a Friday night on a network,

973
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:57,650
you know how many other people are
trying to own a network? Nobody.

974
00:50:58,010 --> 00:51:00,800
You're competing with no one and
you're competing with, you know,

975
00:51:00,801 --> 00:51:05,600
literally when that network that I got
was up for grabs because of this you El

976
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:09,140
Rey, it was a hundred other applicants
know that sounds like a lot.

977
00:51:10,370 --> 00:51:11,450
But at the whole country,

978
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:15,110
a hundred really how many actually
had probably a solid business plan,

979
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:17,310
an actual vision of something
that could be able to bet.

980
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:22,010
It's probably five him with a
top five instead of the top,

981
00:51:22,011 --> 00:51:26,870
you know, 20,000 trying to get an on
NBC Friday night and Saturday night. Um,

982
00:51:26,871 --> 00:51:30,860
so I always say, you know, try to try to
just look, you know, bigger than that.

983
00:51:30,861 --> 00:51:33,200
And I feel failure. That's what I
talk a lot about. Director's chair.

984
00:51:33,201 --> 00:51:34,520
Why was bringing that up with Francis?

985
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:38,300
I like talking about mistakes and
failure a lot with these directors cause

986
00:51:38,301 --> 00:51:39,051
people tend to think,

987
00:51:39,051 --> 00:51:42,350
they just make no mistakes ever and
ever think that that's a bad cause.

988
00:51:42,350 --> 00:51:45,020
I used to think the same way
when I went and did this.

989
00:51:45,021 --> 00:51:48,440
Why did Mariachi by myself? I didn't
want to see people make me make mistakes.

990
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,290
I didn't want them to see me make mistakes
cause I thought it was a bad thing,

991
00:51:51,291 --> 00:51:54,770
but it's not. You learn so much no matter
what. Even if I didn't sell Mariachi,

992
00:51:54,771 --> 00:51:57,700
I would've learned so much by
doing that project. That was a,

993
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,080
that was the idea is I'm there alert.

994
00:51:59,130 --> 00:52:02,390
I'm not there to win and there to learn
because I know when eventually you don't

995
00:52:02,391 --> 00:52:06,410
have to win. Right now she's got to
know I'm going to go do follow my heart,

996
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:10,220
go that way. And sometimes it'll work for
you. Sometimes it will be the godfather,

997
00:52:10,221 --> 00:52:13,700
sometimes it'll be one from the
heart. Sometimes it'll be, you know,

998
00:52:13,701 --> 00:52:17,860
apocalypse now, sometimes
it'll be Jack, you know? No,

999
00:52:17,870 --> 00:52:21,320
but you've got to keep going that way.
And that's kind of what he was saying.

1000
00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:23,870
You know, sometimes failure,
if you have that attitude,

1001
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:26,570
well maybe in 10 years
this will be a success.

1002
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:30,140
It helps a lot to have that
kind of history. You know,
when I'm to make a movie,

1003
00:52:30,141 --> 00:52:32,240
if it didn't do well, I would go, hey,
maybe this is the thing. You know,

1004
00:52:32,241 --> 00:52:34,910
John Carpenter made the thing and it
bombed. Everyone thought it was terrible.

1005
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:36,140
They call it pornography.

1006
00:52:36,141 --> 00:52:39,290
They thought it was he and buried his
head in the sand for 10 years until 10

1007
00:52:39,291 --> 00:52:44,120
years later they announced that it was
a classic and it was a masterpiece.

1008
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:48,320
Of course he, he was wallowing in despair
for 10 years. Thanks. But you know,

1009
00:52:48,321 --> 00:52:51,530
it came late, but, uh, eventually
it would come and if it doesn't,

1010
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:53,070
if you're already on to better things,
so he's,

1011
00:52:53,071 --> 00:52:54,890
as long as you always
think it's not a bad thing,

1012
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:58,100
I try to always look at failure as
a good thing. You know, failure.

1013
00:52:58,330 --> 00:53:00,300
That Winston Churchill quote, I like, um,

1014
00:53:00,590 --> 00:53:03,980
success is moving from one failure
to the next with great enthusiasm.

1015
00:53:04,370 --> 00:53:06,620
You should just be willing to
go fail. Cause I mean, you're,

1016
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:08,870
you're going out that way.
Yeah, that's different.

1017
00:53:08,871 --> 00:53:12,980
You're going into uncharted territory
and that's where you'll find eventually,

1018
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:15,890
you know, as long as you're learning
something, you learn something.

1019
00:53:15,891 --> 00:53:19,370
And sometimes the only way to get across
that river is by slipping on that first

1020
00:53:19,371 --> 00:53:22,670
rock. That's the way there.
And when you get to the side,

1021
00:53:22,671 --> 00:53:23,780
you look back and sure enough,

1022
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:28,200
I could only have gotten here had I done
those things. And people sometimes say,

1023
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:32,610
I remember when I was giving a talk like
that and I had a gal see holds up g and

1024
00:53:32,611 --> 00:53:35,040
she goes, okay, well you're a
real positive, but what do I do?

1025
00:53:35,041 --> 00:53:38,970
What do I tell myself when I just
wasted a year and a half of my life on

1026
00:53:38,971 --> 00:53:42,780
something that didn't work? I said,
well, it's a real negative way to put it.

1027
00:53:42,781 --> 00:53:46,680
Can you rephrase that for me?
I learned something the hard way.

1028
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:49,110
I learned something good to
heartbreak that still sucks. You know,

1029
00:53:49,111 --> 00:53:52,800
you gotta be able to look at your
failures and know that there's a key to

1030
00:53:52,801 --> 00:53:55,800
success and every failure.
We looked at the ashes long enough,

1031
00:53:55,801 --> 00:54:00,360
you'll find something. I'll give you one.
And I did four rooms. Quintin asked me,

1032
00:54:00,361 --> 00:54:01,530
do you want to do one of these movies?

1033
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:04,630
One of these short films called four
rooms, but the one with the bellhop,

1034
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:08,220
the one in a hotel room and my hand
went up right away. Instinctually. Yeah,

1035
00:54:08,221 --> 00:54:11,580
I want to do that. It's an
experimental film. Um, I'm there now.

1036
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:14,130
Should I have answered so quick?
Should I have been a little more studied?

1037
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:17,820
Should I have gone back and researched
and realize anthology movies never work,

1038
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:22,770
even when it's Scorsese and woody
Allen and Coppola, they bomb miserably.

1039
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:26,790
They never work. Should I have researched,
come back given a different answer.

1040
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:30,000
No one could answer that. I think I
know. I would still go with my instinct.

1041
00:54:30,490 --> 00:54:33,030
The movie bombed in the
ashes of that failure.

1042
00:54:33,031 --> 00:54:36,540
I can find at least two keys to success.
If I look back on it on the set,

1043
00:54:36,541 --> 00:54:39,390
when I was doing it at
cast Antonio Banderas,

1044
00:54:39,391 --> 00:54:42,330
it's the dad and had this cool
little Mexican kid as a son.

1045
00:54:42,350 --> 00:54:45,390
It looked really close together and then
I found the best actress I could find

1046
00:54:45,391 --> 00:54:47,790
was this little, you know, half
Asian girl. She was amazing.

1047
00:54:47,970 --> 00:54:48,900
So I needed an Asian mom.

1048
00:54:48,901 --> 00:54:52,290
I really wanted them to look like a
family and I got this great little family

1049
00:54:52,291 --> 00:54:55,290
and it's New Year's Eve because I was
dictated by the script so they're all

1050
00:54:55,291 --> 00:54:59,910
dressed in Tuxedos and I was looking at
Antonio and his and his Asian wife and

1051
00:54:59,911 --> 00:55:03,720
going, wow, they look like this
really cool international spy couple.

1052
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:08,160
What if they were spies and
these two little kids who
can barely tie their shoes,

1053
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:10,260
didn't know they were spies.
They get captured.

1054
00:55:10,261 --> 00:55:12,270
They have to say my thought of
that on the set of four rooms,

1055
00:55:12,330 --> 00:55:16,170
there's four of those now and a
TV series coming. So that one,

1056
00:55:16,171 --> 00:55:20,100
the other one was after it failed.
I thought. I still love short films.

1057
00:55:20,830 --> 00:55:22,950
Anthologies never work.
We shouldn't have had four stories.

1058
00:55:22,951 --> 00:55:24,930
She'd have been three stories cause
that's probably three acts and it should

1059
00:55:24,931 --> 00:55:27,270
just be the same director instead of
different directors because we didn't know

1060
00:55:27,271 --> 00:55:29,010
what each person was doing.
I'm going to try it again.

1061
00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:32,820
Why on earth would I try it again if I
knew that they would don't work because

1062
00:55:32,821 --> 00:55:35,040
you figured something out when
you're doing it the first time.

1063
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:38,370
And that was sin city. So spike
here, Denson city came out of that.

1064
00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:41,550
So you can always look back.
If you have the positive attitude,

1065
00:55:41,551 --> 00:55:45,720
you can look back at what your, that's
why what Francis saying it's correct.

1066
00:55:45,721 --> 00:55:49,650
Failure isn't always durable. You can go
back and you can look at it and go, oh,

1067
00:55:49,651 --> 00:55:50,760
that wasn't a failure.

1068
00:55:50,790 --> 00:55:55,380
That was a key moment in my development
that I needed to take and I can trust my

1069
00:55:55,381 --> 00:55:58,320
instinct. I really can.
Because what is success?

1070
00:55:58,890 --> 00:56:02,370
It's not necessarily measured in dollars.
It can be measured and knowledge.

1071
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:02,581
You know,

1072
00:56:02,581 --> 00:56:07,080
what did I learn that I can now use later
and I may take me 10 years to figure

1073
00:56:07,081 --> 00:56:07,381
it out,

1074
00:56:07,381 --> 00:56:10,860
but it'll be there when I need it and
then I'll be able to look back and check a

1075
00:56:10,861 --> 00:56:14,910
journal and go, Oh yeah, this,
this and that equaled together.

1076
00:56:14,970 --> 00:56:17,070
I'm going to keep that.
I'm going to keep following my gut.

1077
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:19,170
And it's a Mecca said the same thing,

1078
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:20,670
but he should not have
even hired Eric Stone.

1079
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:22,650
He knew it was supposed to be Michael J.

1080
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:24,700
Fox separate your intellect
tries to tell you different.

1081
00:56:24,701 --> 00:56:26,860
Your intellect tries to tell
you you can make anything work,

1082
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:30,070
but your gut is harder to explain to
people because it's just a feeling.

1083
00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:33,130
You can't always go to a studio and say,
I know,

1084
00:56:33,131 --> 00:56:37,260
but I just have a feeling that
would be like, what does that mean?

1085
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:39,220
But that's the dilemma being an artist,

1086
00:56:39,221 --> 00:56:40,870
which is why I've always
kind of chosen low,

1087
00:56:40,871 --> 00:56:43,300
low budget movies so that people
don't have to ask me those questions.

1088
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:46,300
I'm in charge so I can just go,
you know what? If it feels good,

1089
00:56:46,301 --> 00:56:47,560
it is good and that's
where we're going to do.

1090
00:56:47,830 --> 00:56:51,700
What books or book do you most
frequently gift to other people?

1091
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:53,740
I spread out there recently.
It's been some years,

1092
00:56:53,741 --> 00:56:56,080
but for a while when
that book start with why,

1093
00:56:56,260 --> 00:56:59,320
start with why I liked that one a lot
because I'd seen the little talk on Ted

1094
00:56:59,321 --> 00:57:02,500
talk,
Simon Simon Sinek did and um,

1095
00:57:02,950 --> 00:57:06,460
and now it's in that to people and go
look at this is this is so important.

1096
00:57:06,490 --> 00:57:09,960
You know,
I realized better what I was doing when I,

1097
00:57:09,961 --> 00:57:12,850
when I read that book and I gave it
to people to show them how to look,

1098
00:57:12,851 --> 00:57:16,060
clarify what they're doing right
and what they're doing wrong.

1099
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:18,910
And it was a very simple approach that
they should kind of take every day.

1100
00:57:18,930 --> 00:57:20,890
And like if you go to an actor and say,
Hey,

1101
00:57:20,891 --> 00:57:25,390
I'm a filmmaker and I'm making a low
budget movie and I kind of need your name

1102
00:57:25,391 --> 00:57:28,990
as a marquee, kind of helps sell it. Um,

1103
00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:33,920
I can't pay very much and it's going to
be a probably a lot of work. But, um,

1104
00:57:34,090 --> 00:57:36,970
if you want to be in it, you know, you're
thinking about all yourself. It was like,

1105
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:38,230
no,
get the hell Outta here.

1106
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:41,470
Cause they're just only talking about
is what you do and how you do it,

1107
00:57:41,471 --> 00:57:43,810
which is I make a low budget movies. Yeah.
So what it means, you've got no money.

1108
00:57:43,811 --> 00:57:46,870
All right? Instead, I always start with
a why I go to them. I love what you do.

1109
00:57:47,370 --> 00:57:50,380
Always been a big fan.
I've got a part that you never would get.

1110
00:57:50,410 --> 00:57:51,640
I believe in creative freedom.

1111
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:55,210
I don't work with the studios like
work independently. I'm the boss there.

1112
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:58,950
Just me and my in my crew.
It's a very creative, um,

1113
00:57:58,990 --> 00:58:02,650
ask any of your actor friends,
they'll say, go have that experience.

1114
00:58:02,651 --> 00:58:05,980
You're just going to feel so invigorated.
I should very quickly.

1115
00:58:06,010 --> 00:58:09,220
So you'll be out Robert Deniro
in machete in four days.

1116
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:12,130
I'm going to shoot you out in four days
while you'll be on your next movie for

1117
00:58:12,131 --> 00:58:12,690
six months.

1118
00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:15,190
Your mind movie for four days and it's
gonna be the most fun you've ever had.

1119
00:58:15,191 --> 00:58:17,470
And probably you'll get probably great
reviews or performance is going to be

1120
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:21,100
just really free because I'm going to
give you that freedom. That's why I do it.

1121
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:25,540
How do I do it? Well, I work
very independently. I have
very few people in my crew.

1122
00:58:25,541 --> 00:58:28,690
We all do multiple jobs. We do it with
less money so that we have more freedom.

1123
00:58:28,870 --> 00:58:30,550
What is it that we do?
I'm an independent filmmaker.

1124
00:58:30,551 --> 00:58:31,930
Do you want to come make this
movie? They're like, yes.

1125
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:34,660
Because it's all about what they can
do, what they can bring to it, what,

1126
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:38,260
how it's going to fulfill them. You don't
have to mention, oh, and by the way,

1127
00:58:38,261 --> 00:58:42,190
I need your name is on the movie because
really you really are interested in

1128
00:58:42,191 --> 00:58:46,900
their talent and it does bring a, you
know, a level to the, to the picture.

1129
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:50,860
He really got to think about why, why is
it that I'm even doing what I'm doing?

1130
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:54,140
One of my favorite things that I read,

1131
00:58:54,141 --> 00:58:56,270
and I hadn't realized this backstory,

1132
00:58:56,300 --> 00:59:00,670
but was your experiences since
city and Frank Miller and uh,

1133
00:59:00,710 --> 00:59:03,470
the,
well up maybe battle is too strong a word,

1134
00:59:03,471 --> 00:59:06,680
but the decision to insist
on the co-directing. Right.

1135
00:59:06,890 --> 00:59:11,650
And could you just elaborate on that
for folks because as its context, uh, I,

1136
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:12,860
I don't know if I mentioned it before,

1137
00:59:12,861 --> 00:59:15,810
but I have about 10,000 comic
books at home, all poly.

1138
00:59:15,910 --> 00:59:20,910
So I was a comic book addict for decades
and I want it to a comic book penciler

1139
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:25,670
so it's actually an illustrator and in
college for one of the satire magazines.

1140
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:29,450
But I wanted to be a comic book penciler
for a very, very long time. I could you,

1141
00:59:29,690 --> 00:59:34,690
could you give a little bit of the context
around sensity city and a and how you

1142
00:59:35,570 --> 00:59:38,540
have a little context and just in
the battles that you normally have

1143
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:42,410
when you try and step out. And I'm
like, how do you get in trouble?

1144
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:43,940
Like you're asked,
how did you get in trouble all the time?

1145
00:59:43,941 --> 00:59:47,330
It's never intentional.
It's just sometimes you're
just ahead of people's time.

1146
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:50,880
So when Quentin and I were making
these movies, like for, um,

1147
00:59:51,410 --> 00:59:56,150
even I'd have to deal Mariachi, I
went and did some other films and,

1148
00:59:56,151 --> 00:59:56,780
and uh,

1149
00:59:56,780 --> 00:59:59,780
I didn't know if I knew I wanted to join
something like the director's guild.

1150
00:59:59,810 --> 01:00:02,420
And it's nothing that I dislike more
than organizations cause they're usually

1151
01:00:02,510 --> 01:00:07,430
the most disorganized. I think it's called
an organization. You already know, okay.

1152
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:09,620
They have other things in mind.

1153
01:00:09,621 --> 01:00:12,110
It's probably doesn't involve me and it's
suddenly I'm in a box and I want to be

1154
01:00:12,111 --> 01:00:15,380
in a box and George Lucas isn't in the
director's guild and neither is Quinn.

1155
01:00:15,770 --> 01:00:17,600
So I'm,
I'm just stay out of the director's guild.

1156
01:00:17,601 --> 01:00:19,140
And then they'd come after
you after a little while ago.

1157
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:22,430
It's embarrassing that you're out making
films and, and you're not in the guild.

1158
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:25,910
Um, so I said, okay, well I can't,

1159
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,660
I can't really join because I
wanted to do low budget movies.

1160
01:00:29,661 --> 01:00:32,590
Y'All don't have low budget in agreements.
You know, this is kind of my lifeblood.

1161
01:00:32,690 --> 01:00:34,340
This is how we came to kind
of go do whatever I want.

1162
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:37,100
And so what we were
putting some paperwork in,

1163
01:00:37,101 --> 01:00:38,930
they were putting some new
roles that allows that.

1164
01:00:39,350 --> 01:00:41,660
And so I did a film and they made me join.

1165
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:44,870
So I joined in the very first film I
go and make under, it was four rooms,

1166
01:00:44,871 --> 01:00:47,750
which already didn't fall into their
guidelines already had to quit again.

1167
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:51,390
I said it already cost me like five
grand to get into the damn organization.

1168
01:00:51,391 --> 01:00:54,560
So it was like, okay so, Oh man, now
I'm already get out. All right, I'm out.

1169
01:00:54,561 --> 01:00:57,860
I'll just stay out.
I knew it and it's not going to fit me.

1170
01:00:57,861 --> 01:01:00,710
So we go in and make movies for
years and years and they let me go.

1171
01:01:00,830 --> 01:01:02,990
They let me go. Cause it
was like, all right, really,

1172
01:01:02,991 --> 01:01:04,490
how long has this guy's
career going to last?

1173
01:01:04,910 --> 01:01:08,180
And then like four or five films later,

1174
01:01:08,181 --> 01:01:11,930
they come back because it's
becoming embarrassing that
I'm working and no longer

1175
01:01:11,931 --> 01:01:13,250
in the guild. And they, and you know,

1176
01:01:13,251 --> 01:01:15,290
it's all about their faith
and I'm an Hispanic filmmaker,

1177
01:01:15,291 --> 01:01:18,910
which they had very few and I'm not
in the guilt. So they, they, you know,

1178
01:01:18,950 --> 01:01:22,010
coax me back in. I said, but I am
only going to go back in. And I said,

1179
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:24,680
if you don't go back in, we're going
to make harder for you to get a job,

1180
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:27,380
you know, where the other one. So I was
like, Ooh, I was gonna get to that. Okay,

1181
01:01:27,381 --> 01:01:31,230
well I ain't freaking pain again, so
you guys didn't have to pay me in. Um,

1182
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:34,460
because you know, all, you know,
you know, whilst on your deal.

1183
01:01:34,910 --> 01:01:37,970
So I went back in and I was always getting
in trouble because I would be like,

1184
01:01:38,730 --> 01:01:39,900
these organizations don't like hyphen.

1185
01:01:39,901 --> 01:01:42,170
It's so if you're like a writer
and a director and editor,

1186
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:45,050
they like having their name
more prominent than the other.

1187
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:48,140
So the writer's guild would be upset
at director's guild of me as a writer,

1188
01:01:48,141 --> 01:01:49,070
wasn't more prominent than do,

1189
01:01:49,071 --> 01:01:51,860
I mean this stuff that you just
don't care about at all, you know,

1190
01:01:51,861 --> 01:01:53,000
you're just trying to make your movie.

1191
01:01:53,570 --> 01:01:57,250
And so I remember having to leave like
the writer's guild actually after spykids

1192
01:01:57,830 --> 01:02:02,570
because they demanded all kinds of stuff.
And then, um, the directors guild again,

1193
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:03,920
um,

1194
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:08,390
was giving me hassle over having a
credit that said shot chops scored and

1195
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:10,960
directed by Robert Rodriguez. And
once upon a time, Mexico was fine.

1196
01:02:10,970 --> 01:02:12,230
I just had to separate the door.

1197
01:02:12,470 --> 01:02:15,230
I didn't want my name to come up 20
times cause I was doing a bunch of jobs.

1198
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:17,540
But you know, but each kilo that
makes you put your name in there.

1199
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:22,050
So I tried to combine, you didn't want
12 concern raise with your neighbor?

1200
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:26,070
I think he wanted me to separate it
so my name would keep coming back up.

1201
01:02:26,071 --> 01:02:28,680
But he just looked like, you know, really
you get tricycle? It was like, no, no, no,

1202
01:02:28,681 --> 01:02:31,920
no. So here I am. Plus I did the
buoy so fast. I didn't really,

1203
01:02:32,250 --> 01:02:34,890
I'm not the cinematographer main,
I just shot it and it wasn't,

1204
01:02:34,891 --> 01:02:38,730
I wasn't thoughtfully editing new man.
I chopped it and I, I did the music,

1205
01:02:38,740 --> 01:02:38,971
you know,

1206
01:02:38,971 --> 01:02:43,971
I can barely play and it's an orchestra
but I scored it and music composed by

1207
01:02:44,191 --> 01:02:47,310
Robert G, you know, it's like cut out all
the lofty things. They didn't like that.

1208
01:02:47,311 --> 01:02:51,270
So I was always having to go in front
of the board for something. And, um,

1209
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:55,560
and then when sin city came around, that
was like the final Straw because, um,

1210
01:02:56,460 --> 01:02:58,920
I thought,
and it was happened very organically.

1211
01:02:58,921 --> 01:03:01,770
I went to see Frank Miller and I showed
them this test that I did for sin city

1212
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:04,530
and I said, I know what it's like
to create original characters and,

1213
01:03:04,531 --> 01:03:06,390
and not to trust Hollywood,
but this isn't Hollywood.

1214
01:03:06,391 --> 01:03:07,560
This is something totally different.

1215
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:11,010
I made this on my own and I'm
going to offer you a deal.

1216
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:13,020
How about I'll write the screenplay,

1217
01:03:13,050 --> 01:03:15,450
he'll be unremarkable cause I'm gonna
copy it right out of your books.

1218
01:03:15,810 --> 01:03:18,150
It's a November.
I'll have the screenplay by December.

1219
01:03:18,450 --> 01:03:20,130
We'll go shoot a test in January.

1220
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:23,520
What should the opening scene and I
have some actor friends come down.

1221
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:27,650
We'll shoot it, I'll cut it. You'll be
there. You'll do direct with me. Um,

1222
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:31,770
I'll do the effects, I'll do the
score, I'll do the title sequence,

1223
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:35,010
Vic title sequence with all the actors
we want to be in it and not have those

1224
01:03:35,011 --> 01:03:37,860
ended up being in it. Like we
put Bruce Willis, you know,

1225
01:03:37,890 --> 01:03:40,620
Mickey Rourke started putting
names in the fake titles.

1226
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:42,240
And if you like what you see,

1227
01:03:42,241 --> 01:03:44,580
we'll make a deal for the rights
and then we'll make the movie.

1228
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,730
If you don't like you keep it as a
short film. You can show your friends.

1229
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:52,260
So we did it and he went for it
and I had said, is there any,

1230
01:03:52,410 --> 01:03:55,590
you're amazing director, but you're
using a pen instead of a camera.

1231
01:03:55,830 --> 01:03:58,320
I mean the performances you
get out of your paper actors,

1232
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:02,340
I would love to have you there. Do you
want to direct one of them? And he said,

1233
01:04:02,341 --> 01:04:03,900
I've always wanted to
do big fat kills a man.

1234
01:04:03,901 --> 01:04:06,240
You should be there for the whole thing.
You and me, we should direct it together.

1235
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:08,250
I'm really just copying your
thing right out of the book.

1236
01:04:08,251 --> 01:04:11,280
I really want that just to move.
So we should direct this together.

1237
01:04:11,281 --> 01:04:14,940
Because you were, I used
to be a cartoonist. I know.
It's the same freaking thing.

1238
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,130
It's the same thing.
He was telling stories visually.

1239
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:20,550
You're already doing it and when you
go to Hollywood they think of you less

1240
01:04:20,551 --> 01:04:22,320
because you're coming
from the comic world.

1241
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:24,990
They don't realize you're telling stories
visually better than a lot of them.

1242
01:04:25,530 --> 01:04:28,890
So I want to put you where you belong.
You're at that same level.

1243
01:04:28,950 --> 01:04:31,620
You'll walk in and you're already going
to be directing it at the same level as

1244
01:04:31,621 --> 01:04:33,360
another director at telling
you that's what it is.

1245
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:36,270
Cause I know I jumped around all these
jobs, they're all the same creatively,

1246
01:04:36,271 --> 01:04:39,850
they're all the same. So he came and
did it and we're getting ready to go.

1247
01:04:39,851 --> 01:04:43,230
And like a week before production
directors guild calls, Oh here we go.

1248
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:47,310
I'm in trouble again. I don't even
know why. And then calmly said, well,

1249
01:04:47,340 --> 01:04:49,500
office big time.
They call and they say,

1250
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:54,060
you're very aware of our rules.
What rules?

1251
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:56,730
They haven't broke book like this thick.
Like I sit there and read this thing.

1252
01:04:56,731 --> 01:05:00,720
It's like a phone book. What role is
that? Did you can't have two directors?

1253
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:04,530
How's that? I see two directors all
the time. Which housekeeper? Brothers.

1254
01:05:04,531 --> 01:05:09,510
You know the Cohen Brothers? Uh,
you know the Hughes brothers? No.

1255
01:05:09,511 --> 01:05:13,860
They were a teen before they joined the
guild. What? What does that mean? Well,

1256
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:18,670
one of you can't direct this movie and
one of them has to produce and the next

1257
01:05:18,671 --> 01:05:20,800
movie do together you can direct together
cause then you would have already

1258
01:05:20,801 --> 01:05:24,520
established a working relationship. You
have to be what's called a bonafide team.

1259
01:05:25,930 --> 01:05:30,610
Really. I mean I don't
think that's going to fly.

1260
01:05:30,611 --> 01:05:33,250
I mean why do I even go into the guild
and you already just going to tell me

1261
01:05:33,251 --> 01:05:36,230
what to do. They said, well we think they,

1262
01:05:36,310 --> 01:05:37,720
I think they thought I
was doing it on purpose.

1263
01:05:37,721 --> 01:05:40,750
I really didn't know that was a rule I
could, you know, it's just so convoluted.

1264
01:05:40,751 --> 01:05:44,160
It seems like so selective. I said, I
don't think anyone will know that we,

1265
01:05:44,170 --> 01:05:46,780
me and him have never worked together in,

1266
01:05:46,781 --> 01:05:50,020
couldn't you qualified somehow and say
well if you're also the writer, director,

1267
01:05:50,021 --> 01:05:53,380
editor, composer, you
can also do this for now.

1268
01:05:54,430 --> 01:05:55,240
So I,

1269
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:58,300
and the day it was there suggested that
I should leave because they thought I

1270
01:05:58,301 --> 01:06:01,240
was a trouble maker. Right.
They said, we think you should.

1271
01:06:01,270 --> 01:06:03,910
You should believe the guild.
If you're going to do that,

1272
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:06,820
cause we would now allow you to do it.
We'd have to shut down the movie.

1273
01:06:07,340 --> 01:06:08,081
I was like,
well,

1274
01:06:08,081 --> 01:06:10,780
I'm gonna go ask frank because I know
we don't want to shut down the way frank

1275
01:06:10,781 --> 01:06:14,740
wouldn't. How about you just
be the director? I mean,
they don't care if I direct,

1276
01:06:14,890 --> 01:06:18,370
I can direct. I just can't be a name
of director. They don't care. I mean,

1277
01:06:18,371 --> 01:06:21,410
some of these like, you know, uh, Peter
Jackson does the Lord of the rings,

1278
01:06:21,430 --> 01:06:25,000
like five directors, but only one person.
They only want one person credited.

1279
01:06:25,370 --> 01:06:26,650
You know,
cause he can't be in all the sets.

1280
01:06:26,651 --> 01:06:30,520
He has to have other directors out
there, um, with actors, you know,

1281
01:06:30,521 --> 01:06:34,090
but they want the illusion
that has only one director,

1282
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:36,220
which isn't always the
case. And she said, I just,

1283
01:06:36,221 --> 01:06:40,300
I just realized is that why when someone
guessed directs a certain scene in a

1284
01:06:40,301 --> 01:06:44,860
movie, that's why you only see one
name in the credits. Yeah. Uh, so,

1285
01:06:45,340 --> 01:06:48,370
but people don't know that the audience
doesn't know or care about their stupid

1286
01:06:48,371 --> 01:06:52,240
rules. So I said, no one's gonna know, but
anyway, okay, whatever. So I was frank.

1287
01:06:52,241 --> 01:06:56,350
How about I just produce and you direct
by name? You know, I'll be there.

1288
01:06:56,351 --> 01:06:58,750
We'll direct like always, they don't
really care that we both direct,

1289
01:06:58,751 --> 01:07:00,700
even said even both directive you want,

1290
01:07:00,730 --> 01:07:04,390
but only one of me is going to be credited
and I just don't like people giving

1291
01:07:04,391 --> 01:07:07,070
you rules that are just made up
in a box somewhere. You know?

1292
01:07:07,180 --> 01:07:10,510
I just always rub against that and I just,
I just don't, I just don't like that.

1293
01:07:10,511 --> 01:07:14,710
I just get breaks down the freedom and
the spirit of what you're doing and they

1294
01:07:14,711 --> 01:07:16,870
don't understand it and they're
just usually behind the times.

1295
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:18,760
Like when we did that four rooms,
but they didn't have,

1296
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:20,170
they didn't know low budget movies.

1297
01:07:20,171 --> 01:07:22,660
We're going to come in with like a storm
like that and they weren't prepared.

1298
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:25,510
Eventually they came around
but they weren't ready then.

1299
01:07:25,511 --> 01:07:28,860
So you just have to leave until they
can get their shit together. So, um,

1300
01:07:28,870 --> 01:07:31,860
this was another case like that.
They came back many times,

1301
01:07:31,870 --> 01:07:36,130
beg and it turned out very bad for them.
They got so much bad press. So anyway,

1302
01:07:36,131 --> 01:07:39,850
they said, you know, hey, you should
just leave. I said, okay frank,

1303
01:07:40,270 --> 01:07:42,700
what do you think? How about I
produced you direct? And he goes,

1304
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:47,670
well that doesn't seem fair,
so right. What should I do?
And Frank said, well, on my,

1305
01:07:47,671 --> 01:07:51,460
on my tombstone it will say it does not
play well with other kids. And I said,

1306
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:54,580
me too. Oh yeah, I'll just going to quit
all of that. Right. I'm out of here,

1307
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:58,570
I'm quitting. I'm going to stick by the
artists. We're going to do this together.

1308
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:01,660
And, but when we don't have
to tell anybody, it was just
keep it under the radar.

1309
01:08:02,170 --> 01:08:04,360
I'll just leave quietly. I was
always out of there, you know,

1310
01:08:04,390 --> 01:08:07,930
several times and make any noise.
They leaked it to the press,

1311
01:08:07,931 --> 01:08:11,680
they leaked it to the Holly report.
They write my production, you know,

1312
01:08:11,710 --> 01:08:14,470
I guess the screw up my production, they
did it cause I didn't tell him. I don't,

1313
01:08:14,471 --> 01:08:15,530
I'm not in Hollywood house.

1314
01:08:15,531 --> 01:08:18,850
Would they know unless they went near a
leaky faucets and told everybody and it

1315
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:21,080
when it flipped on him.
Yeah. It turned really bad.

1316
01:08:21,150 --> 01:08:24,410
Suddenly everybody wanted to be involved
in this movie that was a renegade or

1317
01:08:24,411 --> 01:08:25,310
the director was,
you know,

1318
01:08:25,311 --> 01:08:29,330
supporting the artist vision so much
that he gave up residuals ever chance of

1319
01:08:29,331 --> 01:08:33,830
getting an award. You know, you just
give up so much by leaving the guilt. Um,

1320
01:08:34,730 --> 01:08:39,680
and, and they got beat up in the
press for years about that. That um,

1321
01:08:39,710 --> 01:08:41,510
for the same reason you
said, yeah, you left the,

1322
01:08:41,511 --> 01:08:45,440
it became such a badge of honor to the
left for the sake of this other artists.

1323
01:08:45,441 --> 01:08:46,820
And when I'd go to get actors,

1324
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:52,160
I would show them that opening scene and
the fake credits. I'm like, Bruce Willis,

1325
01:08:52,161 --> 01:08:53,630
his name was already in the credits,
you know,

1326
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:57,080
but he's a little tour and they would go,
I gotta be in this movie.

1327
01:08:57,081 --> 01:08:57,950
I'm already in the credits.

1328
01:08:57,951 --> 01:09:01,720
And then plus what's going on with a
Gillen and Frank's really co directing and

1329
01:09:01,721 --> 01:09:03,080
he's sent is so exciting.
You know,

1330
01:09:03,081 --> 01:09:08,060
actors gets so into something that's
pure and passionate and about the product

1331
01:09:08,061 --> 01:09:11,840
only in the business. Damn the business
and all, I can go to hell. Oh man,

1332
01:09:11,841 --> 01:09:13,850
they just jumped on that train so fast.

1333
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:17,360
And so we had so many great actors jumping
on board and it, and it was, you know,

1334
01:09:17,361 --> 01:09:19,670
a big, oh, so then this is the big joke.

1335
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:22,400
Here's the topper is now I could do
anything I want with the credits. Yeah.

1336
01:09:22,670 --> 01:09:25,970
So not only is it directed by
Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez,

1337
01:09:26,990 --> 01:09:30,860
I had Quinten come directive one scene,
special guest director,

1338
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:35,750
now that looks like an official title.
Now these guys over, they're like, aw,

1339
01:09:35,751 --> 01:09:39,110
they're whole illusion of a single
director just been squashed by a big movie

1340
01:09:39,111 --> 01:09:41,720
called Sin City because they
wouldn't play freaking ball.

1341
01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:46,200
So now people think that's a
genuine title. But wait a minute,

1342
01:09:46,201 --> 01:09:48,530
it's a special guest director.
Real Tice and no, I made,

1343
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:52,310
I know that's my creation and quit
because they went to Clinton of all people

1344
01:09:52,311 --> 01:09:55,040
because he wasn't in the guild either.
Um,

1345
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:57,350
so it turned into this really funny
thing. So for years, you know,

1346
01:09:57,351 --> 01:09:59,630
they would come back and say, you
really should rejoin, haven't,

1347
01:09:59,660 --> 01:10:01,580
haven't had to rejoin since.
What they don't want.

1348
01:10:01,581 --> 01:10:04,880
And this makes sense is they don't want
like some producer to go to a director

1349
01:10:04,881 --> 01:10:08,150
and say, well, I'm going to be your
co-director. I won't finance the movie.

1350
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:10,400
You'll see how somebody could
abuse that can be turned around.

1351
01:10:11,060 --> 01:10:12,560
But that's clearly not what this was.

1352
01:10:12,561 --> 01:10:15,170
But that's why the rules were so strict
and that's why they didn't want to bend

1353
01:10:15,171 --> 01:10:17,840
the rules and they thought, you
know, I was such a troublemaker.

1354
01:10:17,870 --> 01:10:21,020
Better to let him leave. And I thought
so too. Why, why fit me in that box?

1355
01:10:21,021 --> 01:10:23,120
I don't belong in that box.
I'm always going to be doing something.

1356
01:10:23,121 --> 01:10:27,920
Where do you want like just let me
go fly free. So, um, it's really,

1357
01:10:27,921 --> 01:10:30,470
you know why that
happened? But uh, it again,

1358
01:10:30,471 --> 01:10:33,020
you'll run into resistance if
you're going to go that way.

1359
01:10:33,470 --> 01:10:35,660
Everyone else is trying
to get in the guilt.

1360
01:10:35,690 --> 01:10:37,350
You're actually trying
not to get in the guild.

1361
01:10:37,370 --> 01:10:41,210
You end up on the island of misfit toys
along with George Lucas and Quentin

1362
01:10:41,210 --> 01:10:43,130
Tarantino. I write, Jim
Cameron came over to the table.

1363
01:10:43,131 --> 01:10:45,950
I was sitting with George
Lucas was talking about, I'm
not come out of the guilt,

1364
01:10:45,970 --> 01:10:48,020
I'm, I'm, I'm like George
George left the guild long ago,

1365
01:10:48,021 --> 01:10:51,800
if they were bashing him for credits
and things that he was doing in the star

1366
01:10:51,801 --> 01:10:53,600
wars movies that were really cutting edge,

1367
01:10:53,810 --> 01:10:56,480
that they all ended up
changing their roles to later.

1368
01:10:56,510 --> 01:10:59,080
But back then he was just so
pissed. He Lash, it's not a fit. It,

1369
01:10:59,081 --> 01:11:02,960
it's not a fit for everybody,
especially if you're a really odd,

1370
01:11:02,961 --> 01:11:04,930
you should just be allowed
to go out cause you,

1371
01:11:04,940 --> 01:11:09,390
it is odd d to do that many different
jobs. But that's Kinda how I started. Um,

1372
01:11:09,410 --> 01:11:11,690
even when I went to do Desperado,
I remember telling him,

1373
01:11:11,691 --> 01:11:15,570
I want to edit this movie
as well. And they said, no,

1374
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:20,040
we've never had a director edit his
own movie, just not done. And I said,

1375
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:24,900
well I edited Mariachi and you
bought that. They're like, okay,

1376
01:11:24,901 --> 01:11:27,180
you can edit it, but you have to edit
here in la so we can watch these.

1377
01:11:27,181 --> 01:11:31,080
We don't think you know what you're doing.
And it's up top set the precedent.

1378
01:11:31,081 --> 01:11:33,930
And they showed the, I showed him the
first scene that cut and they were like,

1379
01:11:33,931 --> 01:11:35,640
okay, okay, you know what
you're doing, you can cut it.

1380
01:11:35,641 --> 01:11:38,510
So they were really supportive
after that. But at first it was, um,

1381
01:11:38,610 --> 01:11:41,910
anytime you do something new, you kind
of have to break a precedent in order to,

1382
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:44,810
and once you got the precedent set,
then you can just do it. You do want.

1383
01:11:45,060 --> 01:11:47,460
So now you go into a studio and
they go, oh, that's that guy. He,

1384
01:11:47,461 --> 01:11:50,190
he shoots his own movies. He had his
own movies, he scores his own way.

1385
01:11:50,230 --> 01:11:51,660
That's just how he works.
Um,

1386
01:11:51,690 --> 01:11:55,680
it would be harder later in life to
be an established director and say,

1387
01:11:56,100 --> 01:11:59,180
suddenly I want to edit my own film and
ride and everything on. And I don't know.

1388
01:11:59,250 --> 01:12:01,390
Yeah. He just can't say that we're
going to have to set that precedent.

1389
01:12:01,391 --> 01:12:02,490
So that's what was a really,

1390
01:12:02,491 --> 01:12:06,330
was the great thing about El Mariachi
is that it set a precedent for me doing

1391
01:12:06,331 --> 01:12:09,300
every job if I wanted to solve as
it became available to me later.

1392
01:12:09,340 --> 01:12:13,510
Yeah. I'm known as a, I
could say affectionately,

1393
01:12:13,511 --> 01:12:15,040
but I don't think it's
terribly affectionate. Uh,

1394
01:12:15,190 --> 01:12:20,140
I'm known as a problem author in
publishing because I, uh, have,

1395
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:21,100
uh,
I've,

1396
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:25,330
I've sketched out and then hired my own
artists and designers to do the covers

1397
01:12:25,331 --> 01:12:27,640
for instance. I mean that's like
one of several dozen examples,

1398
01:12:27,641 --> 01:12:31,710
but you kind of have to start
fighting early. Uh, and uh,

1399
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:35,920
then even though they might not
accept your terms, all of your terms,

1400
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:41,230
uh, the expectation is set. So it's
not a, the resistance, it's not futile,

1401
01:12:41,231 --> 01:12:43,390
but it kind of lessens over time it seems.

1402
01:12:44,450 --> 01:12:45,110
Yeah,
I've done all,

1403
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:48,650
I've done it all my posters
since Desperado Cause Don
Desperado the same thing.

1404
01:12:48,651 --> 01:12:51,560
They send a,
and it's not like the studios doing it.

1405
01:12:51,561 --> 01:12:55,970
They send an agency down anyway. It's
not like it's their guys agency shows up.

1406
01:12:56,030 --> 01:12:59,030
Antonio was sick that day and they're
like, oh, what do I want to hear?

1407
01:12:59,031 --> 01:12:59,900
Only one day it's,
we'll just,

1408
01:13:00,170 --> 01:13:03,170
we'll put his outfit on one of the other
crew members and then we'll paste his

1409
01:13:03,171 --> 01:13:07,090
head on later. Like, that's
not going to look right.
Nobody moves like him. Oh Geez,

1410
01:13:07,091 --> 01:13:10,220
this is going to be awful.
So we shot our own poster on the set of,

1411
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:12,480
at the famous one of
him with a gun the side,

1412
01:13:12,481 --> 01:13:14,720
because I saw him doing that one
day on the set and I thought,

1413
01:13:14,721 --> 01:13:16,070
well that's kind of a cool button.
I went,

1414
01:13:16,071 --> 01:13:17,480
took a little snapshot
and that's kind of a,

1415
01:13:17,690 --> 01:13:21,200
that'd be a great poster right there.
And when we went to go show the studio,

1416
01:13:21,201 --> 01:13:25,070
the posters they put up, they look like
DVD covers and one's the other guys did.

1417
01:13:25,310 --> 01:13:28,280
And I put mine up there
too. And um, Lisa Henson,

1418
01:13:28,430 --> 01:13:32,540
president of Columbia looked at all of
them and she looked at the one that I had

1419
01:13:32,541 --> 01:13:35,630
there and show that you liked
that one. And I go, that is mine.

1420
01:13:35,780 --> 01:13:38,070
And then she looks at me
like, Oh shit. And I know, no,

1421
01:13:38,420 --> 01:13:41,390
I wouldn't have said that was
really, oh, we didn't know.

1422
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:45,110
I'm glad I just put it up there along
with the others, didn't say anything.

1423
01:13:45,590 --> 01:13:48,290
And then that set a precedent. From then
on I could go to every studio and go,

1424
01:13:48,291 --> 01:13:51,260
I do my own posters too. So you guys
can go ahead and try and make one,

1425
01:13:51,261 --> 01:13:54,680
but we'll try and make one.
And the key is also to do it early.

1426
01:13:55,070 --> 01:13:58,520
Do it like while you're still shooting.
First impression is everything.

1427
01:13:58,790 --> 01:14:03,080
I'll cut a trailer while
I'm still shooting and send
it to the studio Delco and

1428
01:14:03,081 --> 01:14:04,700
try and make their own over and over.

1429
01:14:04,701 --> 01:14:06,650
And they can't get that first
thing they saw to the head.

1430
01:14:06,651 --> 01:14:08,960
They can still not as good
as the one we saw it. Right?

1431
01:14:09,510 --> 01:14:13,870
You've already done or he stuck it in
there that's jammed in there and it's

1432
01:14:13,871 --> 01:14:16,570
never going to be right. And it's
happened consistently again and again.

1433
01:14:16,571 --> 01:14:19,540
That way that you put in that first,
you know, it has to be a good idea.

1434
01:14:19,541 --> 01:14:22,240
At first it was a good idea.
If it's terrible though,
they'll do better than it.

1435
01:14:22,241 --> 01:14:24,280
You mean you'll agree,
you just thought about who's winning.

1436
01:14:24,281 --> 01:14:25,690
You just don't wanna be
stuck with a bad poster.

1437
01:14:25,691 --> 01:14:29,920
So at least you have something that you
really like in case with all their team.

1438
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:30,970
They don't come up with something.

1439
01:14:31,060 --> 01:14:33,700
And that's always kind of been the case
with us because you're just coming from

1440
01:14:33,701 --> 01:14:35,750
it from a point of view
that's different. I mean, I'm,

1441
01:14:35,751 --> 01:14:38,380
I'm shooting the poster
while I'm shooting the movie.

1442
01:14:38,381 --> 01:14:41,020
I have a set up on the side.
So if we have Robert Deniro,

1443
01:14:41,050 --> 01:14:43,540
they're only for four days. We're not
going to get them later to do a poster.

1444
01:14:43,570 --> 01:14:44,410
That's what they all do.

1445
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:48,070
That's why they don't look anything like
they do in the movie and the posters

1446
01:14:48,071 --> 01:14:50,920
because they haven't thought of that
concept yet. They do that much later.

1447
01:14:51,550 --> 01:14:54,190
I do it right then on the set,
I'll pull them over to the green screen,

1448
01:14:54,191 --> 01:14:56,050
shoot amazing photos of him,
like in,

1449
01:14:56,051 --> 01:14:58,420
in character with all my
actors and I have him.

1450
01:14:58,780 --> 01:15:00,340
So when I go to make the posters for like,

1451
01:15:00,341 --> 01:15:01,900
since he's not in the
middle of another movie,

1452
01:15:01,990 --> 01:15:06,190
it's like from the moment of they
were filming and it's like they're in

1453
01:15:06,191 --> 01:15:09,100
character and it's then it's perfect.
It's really great.

1454
01:15:09,101 --> 01:15:10,840
And you couldn't get a better
performance out of them.

1455
01:15:11,050 --> 01:15:14,620
They're not trying to remember
it later where they were. So, um,

1456
01:15:14,621 --> 01:15:18,130
that's been a big plus is just having my
own production studios in Austin where

1457
01:15:18,131 --> 01:15:21,190
I can just have it a studio
that just makes sense. You know,

1458
01:15:21,191 --> 01:15:25,720
it's just like streamlined and it's
outside of the business. So it's really,

1459
01:15:26,140 --> 01:15:27,850
you question everything that doesn't work,

1460
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:31,390
come up with a new way that
works better for today's Times.

1461
01:15:31,391 --> 01:15:34,330
And that's kind of how we've been able
to pioneer a lot of things like digital

1462
01:15:34,331 --> 01:15:38,080
photography way before anyone was shooting
digital first digital three d movie

1463
01:15:38,081 --> 01:15:40,330
was spiking Spaghetti,
um,

1464
01:15:40,670 --> 01:15:43,510
doing like full on green screen movies
like probably gets three years since city

1465
01:15:43,511 --> 01:15:48,160
was really, uh, we pioneered a lot of
that down there when I was reading,

1466
01:15:48,940 --> 01:15:51,540
reading up on your bio
a couple of times in,

1467
01:15:51,541 --> 01:15:53,500
in a few different sort of
versions of your bio it said.

1468
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:56,080
And then he took two years off for then
like few paragraphs down and then he

1469
01:15:56,081 --> 01:15:59,320
took three years off and came back with x.
Uh,

1470
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:05,580
where are you actually taking
time off and if so, just what,

1471
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:10,450
what's, what takes place? What do you
do in between big projects? Sometimes?

1472
01:16:10,451 --> 01:16:13,450
Um, some, some years are
more active than others.

1473
01:16:13,451 --> 01:16:17,230
I remember one year I did a
shot, um, once upon a time,

1474
01:16:17,231 --> 01:16:21,610
Mexico spike gets to spike. It's
three. And then once upon time,

1475
01:16:21,620 --> 01:16:24,410
Mexican came out, I had shot all these
movies that were all like sitting down.

1476
01:16:24,420 --> 01:16:26,440
I'm kind of at the same time
cause they weren't doing it.

1477
01:16:26,441 --> 01:16:28,150
Some of them have release
dates that are later.

1478
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:30,970
So even though I shot once upon time,
Mexico in 2001,

1479
01:16:30,971 --> 01:16:32,470
it wasn't released until 2003.

1480
01:16:33,010 --> 01:16:35,980
So sometimes the look like there's an
activity when you're actually working on

1481
01:16:35,981 --> 01:16:38,790
something and then sometimes the movie's
done different parts and it sits there

1482
01:16:38,791 --> 01:16:39,970
and then it's,
you know,

1483
01:16:39,990 --> 01:16:42,910
if they think the release dates better
six months later and then that pushes it.

1484
01:16:43,330 --> 01:16:46,150
So, um, sometimes it'll look
like there's bigger gas,

1485
01:16:46,151 --> 01:16:50,140
but usually consistently I'll shoot
between one and two movies a year. Got It.

1486
01:16:50,620 --> 01:16:53,890
That was very consistent.
I can't eek out books, uh,

1487
01:16:53,891 --> 01:16:56,350
at any faster than like one
per three or four years.

1488
01:16:56,351 --> 01:17:00,550
I just don't have the stem and uh, uh,
what's, this is a question I'm, I'm,

1489
01:17:00,930 --> 01:17:03,640
I'm stealing from your interviews
in the director's chair,

1490
01:17:03,641 --> 01:17:08,641
but what seen have you taken the most
takes of work shots seen at taking the

1491
01:17:09,501 --> 01:17:14,240
most takes of takes, excuse me, yet,
you know, it's different. I don't,

1492
01:17:14,270 --> 01:17:18,770
I don't shoot, um, I should
very differently because, uh,

1493
01:17:18,771 --> 01:17:22,130
I've always thought as an editor
because I started that way. In fact,

1494
01:17:22,131 --> 01:17:25,280
that's why they didn't want me to cut
desperado they'd saw the footage and it

1495
01:17:25,281 --> 01:17:27,650
didn't look like daily
footage they normally got.

1496
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:30,380
We're usually someone walks in the room,
they come and sit down,

1497
01:17:30,381 --> 01:17:32,180
they do the whole scene and you cut me.

1498
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:35,450
I would only shoot him walking in the
room that I would cut cause I knew that in

1499
01:17:35,451 --> 01:17:35,961
the wide shot,

1500
01:17:35,961 --> 01:17:38,210
that's all I was going to use because I
was already seeing how it was going to

1501
01:17:38,211 --> 01:17:40,670
edit it. And so, um,

1502
01:17:40,740 --> 01:17:43,640
it almost couldn't be edited by anybody
else cause I kind of only shot it one

1503
01:17:43,641 --> 01:17:47,030
way. So, um, and that's just
because that's how I learned.

1504
01:17:47,031 --> 01:17:50,240
I mean I used to cut in the camera.
I know Mariachi that Cameron was so loud,

1505
01:17:51,110 --> 01:17:53,330
we make it sound like that. It sounded
like all your money was going away.

1506
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:57,050
So I would call action. The guy would
start running, then I would start filming.

1507
01:17:57,160 --> 01:18:00,740
So cause the first startup, I'm not
going to use action. He starts running

1508
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:05,690
cut. I wouldn't shoot through
the action and kind of,

1509
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:07,220
I would just shoot the
little portion that has.

1510
01:18:07,220 --> 01:18:11,270
So I was literally shooting my edits.
So I don't, I'm not as extreme now,

1511
01:18:11,271 --> 01:18:11,811
but I won't,

1512
01:18:11,811 --> 01:18:16,760
I won't ever do more than a certain
number takes because as an editor I've

1513
01:18:16,761 --> 01:18:20,900
already seen what all use, um, where
sometimes somebody will shoot thinking,

1514
01:18:20,930 --> 01:18:23,090
I gotta make sure the editor
has enough to work with.

1515
01:18:23,710 --> 01:18:26,990
And so you're covering your way over
covering it where I'm getting only

1516
01:18:26,991 --> 01:18:29,420
specifically what I need,
I can move so much faster because I don't,

1517
01:18:29,421 --> 01:18:32,560
I don't need that. Let's say it's
a problematic shot. Like the,

1518
01:18:32,561 --> 01:18:35,990
the one that Quentin brought up that
was 34 takes or whatever it was.

1519
01:18:35,991 --> 01:18:39,770
We was trying to get like the blood and
the Chinese condom to like pop up over

1520
01:18:39,771 --> 01:18:41,540
the shoulder.
Oh yeah.

1521
01:18:42,090 --> 01:18:45,590
Well quizzes and very old school and he
wants to try to do as much in camera and

1522
01:18:45,591 --> 01:18:50,160
no CG where I would just do a CG fix.
God, it's so like when I showed him, uh,

1523
01:18:50,270 --> 01:18:52,460
since city first time,
um,

1524
01:18:52,550 --> 01:18:57,550
and he sees me Ho she cuts the guy's head
off and the blood sprays her face and

1525
01:18:58,581 --> 01:19:02,030
her eyes don't blink. He was,
that's an impossible shot. And I go

1526
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:06,350
and I said, I don't know,
but I shot it twice.

1527
01:19:06,351 --> 01:19:09,980
So I shot her once with her eyes open,
no blood on her face.

1528
01:19:10,010 --> 01:19:12,700
And then I had her close her eyes
and we sprayed it with blood.

1529
01:19:12,740 --> 01:19:15,030
Of course she flinches he goes, she
didn't flinch at all. It goes what?

1530
01:19:15,031 --> 01:19:15,411
She flinched.

1531
01:19:15,411 --> 01:19:19,790
But I cut that out and I left her eyes
open from the take from few seconds.

1532
01:19:19,791 --> 01:19:23,810
Previously it's, but that's impossible.
So it was impossible, but not for her.

1533
01:19:23,811 --> 01:19:24,644
She can do it.

1534
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:29,000
A normal person can't help but flinch
when they get some thrown in her face.

1535
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:32,720
But she that character can the
actress camp but the character can,

1536
01:19:33,690 --> 01:19:35,930
I said Samson,
I'm talking about and we can do,

1537
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:41,520
you can actually be more not more true
to the character using the technology

1538
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:45,470
cause you're trying to tell a particular
story and give a story point across

1539
01:19:45,860 --> 01:19:46,700
that if you don't,

1540
01:19:46,701 --> 01:19:49,400
sometimes embracing technologies is
good but he likes to try to get it old

1541
01:19:49,401 --> 01:19:53,270
school. I would never have done that. I
would have been like one take. All right,

1542
01:19:53,271 --> 01:19:55,460
we got CG here,
go ahead and spray the bloods.

1543
01:19:55,461 --> 01:19:58,970
We have a real reference of what it looks
like and I can either combine it or to

1544
01:19:58,971 --> 01:20:02,690
really see, cause I don't want it to look
like CG. Let's shoot it, the real bloods.

1545
01:20:02,691 --> 01:20:05,630
We can see what it would look like in
this light and then we'll, you know,

1546
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:09,510
you just don't have to have all
the components simultaneous.
Right, right. Got It.

1547
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:12,660
And that's why I sometimes think with
the Squibb you put a squib on somebody's,

1548
01:20:12,690 --> 01:20:17,130
what's a squib a Squib as an explosive
that makes lawyer bullet hole and I'm in

1549
01:20:17,131 --> 01:20:19,710
here, we get the timing right. Especially
if you show emotion or something.

1550
01:20:19,860 --> 01:20:22,800
Cause by the time the actor reacts to
the fact that he just got shot and then

1551
01:20:22,801 --> 01:20:26,580
does the body movements did that delayed
so you never see it on camera cause you

1552
01:20:26,581 --> 01:20:28,890
when you're editing you'll cut to
the point where it's going back.

1553
01:20:29,190 --> 01:20:32,340
So you have to put that in digitally
anyway. Right. Or something, you know.

1554
01:20:32,341 --> 01:20:33,950
So I anything I,

1555
01:20:33,990 --> 01:20:37,470
my crew already knows Robert doesn't
like anything that requires a countdown.

1556
01:20:38,020 --> 01:20:41,730
You have to go like all right
everybody ready? Three, two, one pop.

1557
01:20:41,731 --> 01:20:44,670
That means that some kind of an explosive
or some kind of a square or some kind

1558
01:20:44,671 --> 01:20:49,380
of gag that's probably not going to
work up doing, having to rewire it,

1559
01:20:49,410 --> 01:20:53,010
do it. That's why he was there so long.
Cause then once you just go in and going,

1560
01:20:53,011 --> 01:20:55,890
now it's like point of no return.
We might as well keep going.

1561
01:20:55,891 --> 01:21:00,090
We're committed now and then, uh, I just
can't, I don't have that kind of money.

1562
01:21:00,410 --> 01:21:04,640
What is it? Actually, let me, let
me, let me pause on that question.

1563
01:21:04,641 --> 01:21:07,640
So one of the things I've really enjoyed
reading about or reading this is just

1564
01:21:07,641 --> 01:21:09,230
my reference, I read so much, uh,

1565
01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:13,400
watching and hearing about in
the Quentin Tarantino interview.

1566
01:21:13,401 --> 01:21:18,350
I think it might've been part one was
talking about how he in the novels that he

1567
01:21:18,351 --> 01:21:22,490
enjoyed or like the Elmore
Leonard, I think it was, uh,

1568
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:27,030
they were non consequential. Right?
And that you would start into you,

1569
01:21:27,070 --> 01:21:30,210
you have something like
reservoir dogs say, uh,

1570
01:21:30,860 --> 01:21:35,070
that starts in media arrests.
They would say in a,

1571
01:21:35,690 --> 01:21:39,290
in writing like right in the action,
which is something I do a lot and in my,

1572
01:21:39,291 --> 01:21:41,170
in my own writing. And then, uh,

1573
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:46,220
you'll see how he would sort of take the
best elements of a novel and create a

1574
01:21:46,221 --> 01:21:48,260
cinematic version of that.

1575
01:21:48,650 --> 01:21:53,650
I was just so happy to see
the way you did sin city.

1576
01:21:54,140 --> 01:21:58,490
I mean, just like I love graphic novels
and there's so like you said, I mean, so,

1577
01:21:58,940 --> 01:22:02,860
uh, so beautiful in some cases
from us or cinematic standpoint,

1578
01:22:02,870 --> 01:22:04,400
even though they're on the static page,

1579
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:08,670
bold, bold shots that I never would've
thought a filmmaker like, wow,

1580
01:22:08,671 --> 01:22:11,100
I never would have put the camera there.
You know,

1581
01:22:11,101 --> 01:22:13,080
how to shoot to and give them that credit.

1582
01:22:13,710 --> 01:22:15,190
But uh,
with Sin City,

1583
01:22:15,191 --> 01:22:20,191
why did you gravitate to that so
much so that you would do the,

1584
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:23,830
the test and approach. Frank, who's,

1585
01:22:24,050 --> 01:22:28,480
I mean very well known for not wanting
his stuff to be adapted. Why did that,

1586
01:22:28,660 --> 01:22:30,970
like what,
what was it that got you so determined?

1587
01:22:31,460 --> 01:22:33,680
It was a book that I would buy
it buy over and over again.

1588
01:22:33,710 --> 01:22:36,050
It was one of those things that that's
when you know something means something

1589
01:22:36,051 --> 01:22:39,950
to you when you, and it's like,
I'm really that dumb. You know?

1590
01:22:39,951 --> 01:22:42,890
I literally was buying the book over
and over for like 10 years before I

1591
01:22:42,891 --> 01:22:45,800
realized, wait a minute, I should be
making a movie out of this. I keep,

1592
01:22:45,801 --> 01:22:49,110
I'm gravitating this for a reason.
Cause that style in particular,

1593
01:22:49,111 --> 01:22:52,820
that black and white style and I'd
wanted to do a film war for a while,

1594
01:22:52,821 --> 01:22:54,290
but it feel like it'd be too nostalgic.

1595
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:59,560
This felt so modern postmodern Fillmore
and the style of it just was so stunning

1596
01:23:00,021 --> 01:23:03,020
in black and white. The absence
of information, you know,

1597
01:23:03,021 --> 01:23:06,610
seeing the less was so captivating,

1598
01:23:06,730 --> 01:23:10,990
it's like this hardly anything there
and it's amazing how little you need to

1599
01:23:10,991 --> 01:23:13,670
recognize the human face or a window or,

1600
01:23:14,110 --> 01:23:16,210
and I loved the basic quality of it.

1601
01:23:16,380 --> 01:23:19,090
I thought that would be so amazing as a
movie and I know that they're going to

1602
01:23:19,091 --> 01:23:20,770
screw it up someday.

1603
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:24,040
They'll try and make a movie of Sin City
cause they're captivated and they won't

1604
01:23:24,041 --> 01:23:27,520
realize it's because have this because
of the visual and they'll go shoot it

1605
01:23:27,521 --> 01:23:31,150
like a regular movie and they'll wonder
why it sits there and doesn't have the

1606
01:23:31,151 --> 01:23:33,280
life that it did in the book because
they're not going to shoot it like that.

1607
01:23:33,970 --> 01:23:36,670
And after I did spike,
it's three on the green screen.

1608
01:23:37,510 --> 01:23:39,910
I went back and looking like I
usually do for my next project.

1609
01:23:39,911 --> 01:23:44,650
I looked through all my, my stuff that I
have and I live in this city again. I go,

1610
01:23:44,651 --> 01:23:47,620
Whoa, I know how to do this now
by shot this on green screen.

1611
01:23:47,860 --> 01:23:50,890
I could make it legit. I Bet I can make
it look just like, well let me test it.

1612
01:23:51,190 --> 01:23:53,650
And I,
and I'm real protective like test stage.

1613
01:23:53,950 --> 01:23:57,180
Not even my crew knew what I was even
shooting cause I have my own stages and

1614
01:23:57,200 --> 01:23:58,033
add a green screen.

1615
01:23:58,300 --> 01:24:01,210
So I just went and asked a few crew
members to come and I need him to show him

1616
01:24:01,570 --> 01:24:05,380
what I was filming. I was filming out
of the book and I staged a few shots,

1617
01:24:05,890 --> 01:24:07,930
took them back,
did them in Photoshop,

1618
01:24:08,020 --> 01:24:12,580
kind of applied it in
three d and it worked.

1619
01:24:12,610 --> 01:24:13,443
It was like,

1620
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:17,830
it looked like you're looking at a static
image of his and suddenly it moved. Um,

1621
01:24:18,460 --> 01:24:21,610
and so I took it to show him
and he flipped out and I said,

1622
01:24:21,611 --> 01:24:24,520
this is how we're going to do it. We're
going to do it exactly like your book.

1623
01:24:24,521 --> 01:24:27,340
We're going to make your book
move instead of taking your book.

1624
01:24:27,730 --> 01:24:31,900
And and adapting that to film. We're
going to take film and adapt it to your,

1625
01:24:32,050 --> 01:24:36,220
to your book. So we're going to switch
it and we're not going to change it.

1626
01:24:36,250 --> 01:24:39,070
So cause everyone who gives you,
you hand him that book and they say,

1627
01:24:39,100 --> 01:24:43,000
oh well now it has to be adapted into
a screenplay and this is fine for a

1628
01:24:43,001 --> 01:24:45,130
graphic novel,
but it's not the same as a movie.

1629
01:24:45,430 --> 01:24:48,580
The wrong visual storytelling
is visual storytelling.

1630
01:24:48,610 --> 01:24:51,730
I don't see why this should not work if
it's just on the screen and we're going

1631
01:24:51,731 --> 01:24:52,564
to prove it.

1632
01:24:52,870 --> 01:24:55,990
And that was what I was so excited about
and everybody who got involved in it

1633
01:24:55,991 --> 01:24:56,950
was so excited about it.

1634
01:24:56,951 --> 01:25:00,140
It was just felt new and different
and fresh and vital and it,

1635
01:25:00,170 --> 01:25:03,360
and it got you so jazzed and I didn't
think it would even be successful because

1636
01:25:03,361 --> 01:25:04,270
he didn't care.
You're like,

1637
01:25:04,271 --> 01:25:07,150
you don't know how I can attract big
stars to this cause it's going to be so

1638
01:25:07,151 --> 01:25:10,000
pure and yeah, it's probably,
it's going to look so weird.

1639
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,190
Black and white anthology,
all voiceover.

1640
01:25:12,191 --> 01:25:15,440
It was the three things you're supposed
to not do. Probably no one will get it.

1641
01:25:15,470 --> 01:25:18,400
When they see the first trailer,
they'll go to artsy or too weird,

1642
01:25:18,670 --> 01:25:21,850
but maybe they'll catch it
later, you know, in DVD or
whatever. I'm fine with that.

1643
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:23,580
I let it be the thing,
you know,

1644
01:25:23,590 --> 01:25:25,510
John Carpenter's the thing and
it let it be 10 years from now,

1645
01:25:25,511 --> 01:25:27,310
people figured I just
really need to make it.

1646
01:25:28,300 --> 01:25:31,410
And then if was successful the first time,
but that might not have happened. Yeah.

1647
01:25:31,620 --> 01:25:33,870
It easily could have used easily.
Could have gone the other way. Yeah.

1648
01:25:33,940 --> 01:25:36,940
People just think it's too
weird and that's it. You
know, he was just saying sure.

1649
01:25:36,950 --> 01:25:37,000
Of

1650
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:40,740
Vindication for me to finally
see it done. Right. So I was,

1651
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:47,240
I remember when the first punisher movie
got made and announced and I fought my

1652
01:25:48,001 --> 01:25:52,260
parents tooth and nail to not go to
summer camp because I wanted to see this

1653
01:25:52,261 --> 01:25:56,520
movie so badly and like, and, and I
was such a petulant pain in the ass.

1654
01:25:56,521 --> 01:25:58,560
Cause then I got to summer camp and
I knew the movie was coming out.

1655
01:25:58,561 --> 01:25:59,650
I wouldn't see it.
And so I would send,

1656
01:26:00,020 --> 01:26:04,130
we were required to send
these daily letters or as
either or weekly letters home

1657
01:26:04,131 --> 01:26:07,640
to our parents to tell them about
summer camp and I was just bitching and

1658
01:26:07,641 --> 01:26:08,540
moaning and every letter he,

1659
01:26:08,541 --> 01:26:11,120
cause I was still not going
to see the punisher movie,

1660
01:26:11,330 --> 01:26:14,450
but then it came out and it was,
it was,

1661
01:26:14,451 --> 01:26:18,860
they didn't preserve the integrity of
the beautiful aspect of what drew me to

1662
01:26:18,861 --> 01:26:21,290
the comic in the first place.
So anyway, I mean Kudos to you.

1663
01:26:21,291 --> 01:26:22,310
I was just so thrilled.

1664
01:26:22,590 --> 01:26:24,460
No, it was exciting and
especially after all that,

1665
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:26,740
but it felt like that kind of the thing,

1666
01:26:26,741 --> 01:26:31,741
it felt like it was the one is what the
fastest when we ever got going with a

1667
01:26:31,960 --> 01:26:34,570
vendor who had the idea to go show
frank that test. As soon as I saw it,

1668
01:26:34,990 --> 01:26:36,340
I literally met him in November.

1669
01:26:36,640 --> 01:26:39,760
I gave him the script and December
we shot the test in January,

1670
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:43,000
showed it to a few actors
like Bruce Willis in that,

1671
01:26:43,001 --> 01:26:44,920
and we were shooting
the real film by March.

1672
01:26:44,980 --> 01:26:49,210
Does the fastest any Hollywood movies
ever taken off by far because it was

1673
01:26:49,211 --> 01:26:51,460
already written in the book and when
we weren't going adopted, you know,

1674
01:26:51,461 --> 01:26:55,510
really right. And the drawings
were already done. So, um, and I,

1675
01:26:55,511 --> 01:26:57,930
and then you'd only cast per episodes.

1676
01:26:57,940 --> 01:27:01,840
I would shoot the first episode would
make you work and if I didn't have another

1677
01:27:01,841 --> 01:27:05,890
actor like the bad guy who were Grauer,
it's like it's okay. A shooted with me.

1678
01:27:05,891 --> 01:27:08,620
And we were replacing me later cause
it's green screen shot him eight months

1679
01:27:08,621 --> 01:27:11,680
later and him and Mickey,
you'd swear they had a scene together.

1680
01:27:11,770 --> 01:27:12,940
He goes up and even killed the guy,

1681
01:27:12,941 --> 01:27:16,300
puts his hands on his face and crushes
him and they never met. You know,

1682
01:27:16,301 --> 01:27:17,200
things like that you can do.

1683
01:27:17,201 --> 01:27:19,210
You were just so excited about all
of the things that you could do,

1684
01:27:19,211 --> 01:27:21,400
all the possibilities,
all the people you could put in the movie.

1685
01:27:21,700 --> 01:27:24,490
And I would shit shut down
for a week after each story.

1686
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:28,060
Short story cast the next one quickly
they would come down, we should,

1687
01:27:28,061 --> 01:27:31,060
they're part shut down again.
Caslin x when they'd show up.

1688
01:27:31,090 --> 01:27:34,030
So He'd just do it like in three
segments. It was fantastic. It's amazing.

1689
01:27:34,090 --> 01:27:37,450
It was the most fun
shoot. What is, uh, your,

1690
01:27:38,440 --> 01:27:41,390
when we were talking about starting
with Hawaii and you, you, you,

1691
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:43,210
you mentioned kind of starting your day,
what does,

1692
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:46,540
what does the first 60
minutes of your day look like?

1693
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:49,240
Do you have any particular
kind of changes? If I don't,

1694
01:27:49,300 --> 01:27:52,140
if I don't go through my list of
things I want to do for the next day,

1695
01:27:52,140 --> 01:27:56,160
the night before, which I try to
do so that, and I have, uh, I have,

1696
01:27:56,670 --> 01:28:01,590
I have long lists of things to
do. Um, this is in your phone,

1697
01:28:01,880 --> 01:28:06,120
some of my phone and I use notes to notes
that comes with it because it's faster

1698
01:28:06,460 --> 01:28:07,980
if I have to open another program.

1699
01:28:07,981 --> 01:28:10,980
Like I never known anything and
it's got to load. That's too late.

1700
01:28:10,981 --> 01:28:15,210
Is the ideas out of my head already? I
need a scratch pad. That's really fast.

1701
01:28:15,660 --> 01:28:20,280
So here this one's called bullet lists
2015 while you have holders for the year.

1702
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:23,970
No, no, this is just what I know. This
is the year I see. You just add to it.

1703
01:28:25,050 --> 01:28:26,070
I just keep adding to it.

1704
01:28:26,160 --> 01:28:31,160
And now that's the top portion
of another list called hit list,

1705
01:28:31,770 --> 01:28:35,490
which is a top which has three parts
it one, two and three. It's like a,

1706
01:28:35,700 --> 01:28:37,920
this is an offshoot of an
offshoot of an off shoot.

1707
01:28:39,370 --> 01:28:44,370
Every once in a while I'll go through
but really I'll put at the very top and

1708
01:28:44,401 --> 01:28:47,310
then I'll put some x's under it.
Stuff I need to do that day,

1709
01:28:47,900 --> 01:28:50,720
like things that I know I need to do.
And the middle one to just say, yeah,

1710
01:28:50,850 --> 01:28:54,720
the top priority thing like that was
like make a show until Ferris because I

1711
01:28:54,721 --> 01:28:57,510
knew I was going to see you.
So um, tell fairs with time,

1712
01:28:59,290 --> 01:29:01,680
learn this guitar lick that
I always wanted. I put it,

1713
01:29:02,030 --> 01:29:04,860
I'm going to drop that one down eventually
but at least it goes on the top right

1714
01:29:04,861 --> 01:29:05,520
now.

1715
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:08,580
But I'll check my list to make sure I'm
not supposed to be doing something that

1716
01:29:08,581 --> 01:29:11,360
everyone needs to do in the morning.
I have like half waking up. Usually I,

1717
01:29:11,361 --> 01:29:14,370
but I like to do is try to work out
in the morning because it's just,

1718
01:29:14,371 --> 01:29:19,230
you usually wake up. Um, I just finished
night shooting, so I'm all three.

1719
01:29:19,231 --> 01:29:21,750
Your alternative? Yeah, usually I don't
go to sleep now to six in the morning.

1720
01:29:21,751 --> 01:29:23,370
I'm trying to nic knock it back,

1721
01:29:23,490 --> 01:29:25,260
really have to go to sleep to
two or three in the morning.

1722
01:29:25,261 --> 01:29:28,620
Sometimes four in the morning. I'll
get up around like 11, 10, 30, 11.

1723
01:29:28,621 --> 01:29:31,750
No matter what. You know, I just
kind of wake up and I'll go start.

1724
01:29:31,751 --> 01:29:34,650
And if I can get an app later
in the day, then I will. But um,

1725
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:38,790
I'll go down and get some breakfast,
which is, you know, I'm allergic to eggs,

1726
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:43,250
egg whites. So that went out the
dough. So it's um, I like those um,

1727
01:29:44,110 --> 01:29:48,360
um, plant fusion protein shakes that
are, that are plant not so tasty.

1728
01:29:48,361 --> 01:29:51,390
It's like 25 grams of protein or
something and one scoop. Oh my God.

1729
01:29:51,620 --> 01:29:55,080
So I do two scoops of that and then I'll
either have beans cause I live there.

1730
01:29:55,110 --> 01:29:57,920
You're being diabetic because I'm Mexican,
so shit easy.

1731
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:01,380
I bake fresh beans are awesome
for like last week, a whole week.

1732
01:30:01,410 --> 01:30:04,810
And I use a set of rocks. He used
to love beans and rice. Um, I,

1733
01:30:04,820 --> 01:30:05,940
I do cauliflower rice,

1734
01:30:05,941 --> 01:30:08,250
so you just make rice out of
the cauliflower with Kale in it.

1735
01:30:08,610 --> 01:30:11,850
And I season at the same way do Spanish
rice and man you can't tell it tastes so

1736
01:30:11,851 --> 01:30:15,410
good and you've done it all day and eat
that. And then I'll have a, you know,

1737
01:30:15,420 --> 01:30:20,270
some other protein if I need to and
them and then that get me going. Um,

1738
01:30:20,300 --> 01:30:23,790
I'll either work out or if I have meetings
or sometimes if I just have to write

1739
01:30:23,791 --> 01:30:25,050
or do something,
I'll go attack,

1740
01:30:25,230 --> 01:30:28,450
try and knock out some things that I have
and always have something to ride them.

1741
01:30:28,460 --> 01:30:29,970
I didn't like for script right now.
So it's like,

1742
01:30:29,971 --> 01:30:32,780
usually it's something
that's more, um, you know,

1743
01:30:32,970 --> 01:30:36,430
pressing and I'll try and knock it out
during the day if not later under the day.

1744
01:30:36,430 --> 01:30:40,110
And I try and limit meetings and things
to to a couple of days so that I can

1745
01:30:40,140 --> 01:30:44,130
really have blocks of time to get some
of these things to hundred bucks cause I

1746
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:46,830
now that I own a television network,
those are,

1747
01:30:46,890 --> 01:30:49,220
these things keep popping up so you can,
your,

1748
01:30:49,221 --> 01:30:52,200
your list is never going to be
accurate because later that day,

1749
01:30:52,230 --> 01:30:55,710
oh I got to look at episode two oh
seven for the, for the new season of,

1750
01:30:55,711 --> 01:30:58,560
from dusk till dawn and I
got to go put eyes on it.

1751
01:30:58,620 --> 01:31:01,680
If it's not completely a hundred percent
I'm going to have to go edit it myself,

1752
01:31:01,950 --> 01:31:02,970
do some editing on it.

1753
01:31:03,150 --> 01:31:06,360
So I got a blackout time for that and
then it'll have some other, you know,

1754
01:31:06,390 --> 01:31:08,910
ideas for things.
My Endo episode I gotta be editing on,

1755
01:31:08,911 --> 01:31:11,940
I've got to start looking at that already
and thinking about music and stuff and

1756
01:31:11,970 --> 01:31:14,940
score ideas and so that's
going to take its own time.

1757
01:31:14,940 --> 01:31:17,760
So I got to like really
jam when I start the day.

1758
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:21,480
Even if I think I got a full day that's
going to be dedicated to whatever I have

1759
01:31:21,481 --> 01:31:25,230
on my list, five or six other things
are going to pop up, you know,

1760
01:31:25,231 --> 01:31:28,320
that are just as important that I
can't get away from. Yeah. So, um,

1761
01:31:28,380 --> 01:31:32,850
it's really just a chipping away at
everything and always trying to make, um,

1762
01:31:33,460 --> 01:31:35,160
I learned this and I remember
we learned this from,

1763
01:31:35,940 --> 01:31:39,150
but I love to take on a lot
of different things, you know,

1764
01:31:39,151 --> 01:31:41,970
like take on many different projects.
I mean,

1765
01:31:41,971 --> 01:31:44,460
I'll give you a list of the projects
that have on right now there's a lot,

1766
01:31:44,490 --> 01:31:46,500
but if you just chip away at each one,

1767
01:31:46,501 --> 01:31:50,430
you gain momentum on all of them and then
you're living your dream by end of the

1768
01:31:50,430 --> 01:31:51,360
week. You're living
your dream, you're that,

1769
01:31:51,361 --> 01:31:53,880
you're doing everything that you want
to do. You're not doing it all day,

1770
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:56,130
maybe 30 minutes here,
30 minutes there,

1771
01:31:56,490 --> 01:31:59,190
but it's chipping away and it's gaining
momentum and it's not, you know,

1772
01:31:59,230 --> 01:32:02,860
just falling by the wayside.
What is, what are the hit lists?

1773
01:32:03,410 --> 01:32:07,450
So I just call it and it used to be called
to do lists and then I needed to make

1774
01:32:07,451 --> 01:32:09,960
another one to differentiate
and it's called hit list.

1775
01:32:09,970 --> 01:32:12,660
So likes like things I
have to do right now. Okay.

1776
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:17,650
And then so then the name, it's just
kind of like everything I got to do,

1777
01:32:17,651 --> 01:32:21,850
I was just like recent more recent
things that I needed to do or the most

1778
01:32:21,851 --> 01:32:23,470
important from from the to do list.

1779
01:32:23,471 --> 01:32:26,800
Went to the hit list and then as
that just grew and became unwieldy,

1780
01:32:27,190 --> 01:32:31,180
I just took like the top section of that
and moved it to a new one and then the

1781
01:32:31,181 --> 01:32:36,181
top six of that and move to like a
pyramid of champagne glasses just keeps,

1782
01:32:37,480 --> 01:32:39,560
keeps going, spilling over
to the next level. I now,

1783
01:32:39,580 --> 01:32:42,320
and I try to keep a separate one
for my kids cause I'll, I'll um,

1784
01:32:42,490 --> 01:32:44,750
I pride myself most on
being a great father.

1785
01:32:44,751 --> 01:32:48,400
I have five kids and I'm applying
all this to being a father.

1786
01:32:48,401 --> 01:32:52,790
So I'll keep a whole list
just for them. Um, uh,

1787
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:57,190
things that I want to tell him or talk
to them about or show them or do and it's

1788
01:32:57,191 --> 01:33:01,870
jam packed. So when they come over on the
weekends, we go through the list, boom,

1789
01:33:01,871 --> 01:33:04,570
boom, boom, boom, boom. And everything
that I've thought of over the week,

1790
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:08,850
I've had a place to dump it and we get
it all done. So you get this really, um,

1791
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:10,690
concise,

1792
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:15,970
dense experience with dance experience
more than if it was just spread out,

1793
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:19,280
you know, here and there you
really get to feel like you've, uh,

1794
01:33:19,510 --> 01:33:24,130
spend really quality time with them and
none of the ideas that you've had that

1795
01:33:24,131 --> 01:33:25,780
you want to share with them fly away.

1796
01:33:25,860 --> 01:33:28,810
So really capturing these ideas
is the most important thing.

1797
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:31,870
And then did you go through your realize,
okay, this one I'll never do this one.

1798
01:33:31,871 --> 01:33:32,501
I'll never do,
you know,

1799
01:33:32,501 --> 01:33:35,800
with your to do list and stuff or it's
already taken care of itself some other

1800
01:33:35,801 --> 01:33:39,520
way. I don't, I don't fret too much
about stuff that I'm not getting done.

1801
01:33:39,640 --> 01:33:41,830
Somehow they, they always end
up figuring themselves out.

1802
01:33:41,831 --> 01:33:43,180
So I tend to not stress at all,

1803
01:33:43,570 --> 01:33:46,360
but it does wake me up at night sometimes
when I realized I gotta write that

1804
01:33:46,361 --> 01:33:49,600
down or I'll forget it.
I will forget and then it'll,

1805
01:33:49,960 --> 01:33:52,000
I'll be stressed knowing
that I forgotten something.

1806
01:33:52,030 --> 01:33:53,560
I don't have nowhere to
civically what it is.

1807
01:33:53,820 --> 01:33:58,000
Well this is why I know it's all
captured and I can get through with your

1808
01:33:58,090 --> 01:33:58,960
network.
What is,

1809
01:33:58,961 --> 01:34:03,310
what is the best way for people to check
out the content on the network? Oh Man.

1810
01:34:03,311 --> 01:34:07,900
Well right now we're just now
in 40 million homes, which
is amazing. After a year,

1811
01:34:08,460 --> 01:34:10,270
um,
we're on all the big carriers.

1812
01:34:10,271 --> 01:34:12,580
A lot of people don't even realize they
have us cause it wasn't something that I

1813
01:34:12,581 --> 01:34:15,130
had to buy extra. So they
should just look for it. So,

1814
01:34:15,131 --> 01:34:19,420
cause you're pointing to start
whoever, Comcast, directv, Time Warner,

1815
01:34:19,990 --> 01:34:24,100
Cox, um, dish. We're on sling TV now.

1816
01:34:24,101 --> 01:34:26,800
We're one of the few channels and
that offering where you can just buy a

1817
01:34:26,801 --> 01:34:30,220
subscription and you can get like
20 networks or something like that.

1818
01:34:30,340 --> 01:34:33,210
I'll raise one of them. And that's doing
really well for, it's a lot of people.

1819
01:34:33,220 --> 01:34:35,990
A lot more people have gotten
that than we thought. Um,

1820
01:34:36,570 --> 01:34:38,470
and then individual programs like we have,

1821
01:34:39,150 --> 01:34:40,630
what's it like when
you have a new network?

1822
01:34:40,631 --> 01:34:43,900
You don't really create new shows for
like five years or six years you use,

1823
01:34:43,901 --> 01:34:45,690
you just show old programming.
Right. I can't even see,

1824
01:34:45,691 --> 01:34:48,310
you didn't make an original show for
20 years, you know, it was just legion,

1825
01:34:48,490 --> 01:34:51,460
really just old license program
in American movie classics.

1826
01:34:51,461 --> 01:34:56,461
And we had four new shows the first year
because we had to kind of make our mark

1827
01:34:56,741 --> 01:34:59,390
and show people the only way people are
going to find the network does if they

1828
01:34:59,391 --> 01:35:02,000
heard of these shows. Oh,
director's chair. Where's that? Oh,

1829
01:35:02,001 --> 01:35:05,240
it's on were El ray network. What's
that? Oh, ductile. Dawn. A TV series.

1830
01:35:05,710 --> 01:35:07,410
Where is that again? Oh Ray. What's Rey?

1831
01:35:07,430 --> 01:35:09,170
And they'd have to go look
for El Rey and find it.

1832
01:35:09,410 --> 01:35:13,070
So the only way to really draw people
is by having programming that's only

1833
01:35:13,071 --> 01:35:15,380
exists there.
And we only do stuff that we can do.

1834
01:35:15,770 --> 01:35:18,380
Like no one could get the rights to
from dusk till dawn. They wanted it.

1835
01:35:18,381 --> 01:35:20,210
But Quinn and I controlled it.
Well he,

1836
01:35:20,300 --> 01:35:22,610
he let me do it for my own network
cause he was like, all right,

1837
01:35:22,620 --> 01:35:25,490
what's your networks like my
network and he loves the network.

1838
01:35:25,491 --> 01:35:28,640
He loves all this stuff. We show,
um, it's all curated content.

1839
01:35:28,641 --> 01:35:32,270
That's what's so cool is if you've got
to use licensed programming, well man,

1840
01:35:32,271 --> 01:35:35,780
it's what's, what's my favorite
movies? Kung Fu, you know,

1841
01:35:35,870 --> 01:35:40,310
John Rhe films actually film brass
knuckle Mondays, creature feature Fridays,

1842
01:35:40,311 --> 01:35:41,840
you know,
just licensed the best,

1843
01:35:42,170 --> 01:35:44,810
the coolest stuff to show people kind
of hear these are the great ones.

1844
01:35:44,811 --> 01:35:49,010
These are the ones that you should know
and this is why we cure rate him like

1845
01:35:49,011 --> 01:35:50,840
that.
So it's a real curated experience.

1846
01:35:50,841 --> 01:35:54,410
And then there's premier programming
and it's so fun as having a network is

1847
01:35:54,411 --> 01:35:56,780
sometimes you'll stumble upon an idea.

1848
01:35:57,170 --> 01:36:01,130
Like I was going to have five John
Carpenter movies into no may last year.

1849
01:36:01,700 --> 01:36:05,540
And I thought, I know John, I'll go film
him introducing each one of those films.

1850
01:36:05,570 --> 01:36:09,300
Little intro. So it'll be
a little original piece of
content to go with it. Well,

1851
01:36:09,301 --> 01:36:12,980
shit, while I'm there, you know, sit and
just setting up the mics and the camera.

1852
01:36:13,310 --> 01:36:15,920
I'll just shoot the shit
from about directing.

1853
01:36:16,220 --> 01:36:18,800
They'll call it the director's chair,
tried to do an episode of that.

1854
01:36:18,801 --> 01:36:23,240
And maybe that can be a show kind of like,
but John is in very forthcoming,

1855
01:36:23,241 --> 01:36:26,540
he's very toxic stuff down a lot
and he's always like, ah, this is,

1856
01:36:26,541 --> 01:36:30,110
anybody can do it. And he's, he
came, he and you've most interviews,

1857
01:36:30,111 --> 01:36:32,360
you read about them.
They're not at all like the show I did.

1858
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:34,070
So I thought it'd be a good test.

1859
01:36:34,130 --> 01:36:38,390
I did the show with him and he was so
profound and so professorial and so open

1860
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:41,330
that I thought, oh my God,
this is John Talking like this.

1861
01:36:41,340 --> 01:36:44,580
Imagine the other directors
who are already like that. Um,

1862
01:36:45,200 --> 01:36:47,630
friends of mine called
and said the new John.

1863
01:36:48,290 --> 01:36:51,470
I've never seen him talk like that before.
And I've known him 20 years, you know.

1864
01:36:51,860 --> 01:36:54,590
So there was something about a director
talking to another director that was

1865
01:36:54,591 --> 01:36:58,160
going to spark a different
third. Disarming a different
level of conversation.

1866
01:36:58,640 --> 01:37:01,430
And now that's one of my favorite things
to shoot and it's so quick, you know,

1867
01:37:01,431 --> 01:37:02,870
I'll research for about a week,

1868
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:05,930
week and a half sometimes get
to rewatch all their films,

1869
01:37:06,350 --> 01:37:08,770
come in with like 30 pages of notes and,
and,

1870
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:12,770
and ask them these great questions that
I've always wanted to know and the best

1871
01:37:12,771 --> 01:37:15,770
stuff comes out. Just did it. Michael
Mann when an end. George Miller one,

1872
01:37:15,771 --> 01:37:19,440
those are really good.
What have been some of the most uh,

1873
01:37:19,580 --> 01:37:24,050
surprising answers that
you've received or a

1874
01:37:25,640 --> 01:37:28,130
captivating answers?
Just you just never know.

1875
01:37:28,280 --> 01:37:33,280
I mean Semeka saying he thought he was
making the worst movie ever and Forrest

1876
01:37:33,770 --> 01:37:33,860
Gump,

1877
01:37:33,860 --> 01:37:36,830
you know those moments of darkness where
you're just like questioning everything

1878
01:37:37,310 --> 01:37:40,350
or that he was punched, punching,
you know, and back to the future.

1879
01:37:40,351 --> 01:37:42,410
Your most cut the Johnny be
good sequence cause he was like,

1880
01:37:42,411 --> 01:37:43,610
well it doesn't really fit.

1881
01:37:43,960 --> 01:37:46,310
That's what I was going to cut it
even before we even preview it.

1882
01:37:46,311 --> 01:37:48,850
And as soon as editor was like,
just leave it in for this free space.

1883
01:37:49,940 --> 01:37:52,340
He said we couldn't peel people off the
ceiling and you know, you never know.

1884
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:55,530
It shows that you don't know,
and when I use an artist,

1885
01:37:55,531 --> 01:37:58,740
I want people to hear those stories
because when you feel like, ah,

1886
01:37:58,860 --> 01:38:01,500
I don't know if I'm doing it right,
these other guys seem to know no,

1887
01:38:01,501 --> 01:38:02,700
they don't know.
None of them know.

1888
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,190
That's the beauty of it is
that you don't have to know.

1889
01:38:05,580 --> 01:38:06,940
You just got to keep moving forward.

1890
01:38:07,310 --> 01:38:10,770
You have to go sit down and put pen to
paper. It's not going to come to you.

1891
01:38:10,860 --> 01:38:12,330
If you just sit there
waiting for it to happen,

1892
01:38:12,331 --> 01:38:15,540
you have to act and then as soon as
you step forward, even a little bit,

1893
01:38:16,360 --> 01:38:19,380
it starts sweeping you away,
doesn't it? Is Flow and you're like,

1894
01:38:19,590 --> 01:38:22,830
how am I doing this? Then you're like,
it's not you, but you had to start.

1895
01:38:23,130 --> 01:38:26,130
If you don't start it as income.
Yeah. It only comes if you start,

1896
01:38:26,610 --> 01:38:28,470
so that's the main thing.
He just got to start.

1897
01:38:29,010 --> 01:38:30,870
When you think of the word successful,

1898
01:38:31,050 --> 01:38:32,850
who's the first person
who comes to mind for you?

1899
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:34,520
Okay.

1900
01:38:34,520 --> 01:38:36,620
Wow, that's a good one. Successful.

1901
01:38:41,110 --> 01:38:41,943
Okay.

1902
01:38:42,030 --> 01:38:46,710
So many different ways to find
the success. Yeah, that's, I mean,

1903
01:38:46,711 --> 01:38:49,230
I always thought my dad
was successful because he,

1904
01:38:49,770 --> 01:38:51,870
he was an entrepreneur and that he,
um,

1905
01:38:53,220 --> 01:38:56,940
he had 10 kids and he sold
cookware door to door.

1906
01:38:58,170 --> 01:39:01,380
And with the beauty of
that was he'd come home,

1907
01:39:01,950 --> 01:39:06,270
my mom would say to the kids need braces.
He could calculate how many,

1908
01:39:06,600 --> 01:39:10,050
how many sets of cookware he had
to sell in order to pay that.

1909
01:39:10,350 --> 01:39:13,080
And he'd go sell it. He wouldn't,
he knew he had a target.

1910
01:39:13,500 --> 01:39:18,060
If he worked at a job where he got just
the same amount of money, no matter what,

1911
01:39:18,090 --> 01:39:22,590
you'd be screwed.
But because he could go just sell harder,

1912
01:39:23,100 --> 01:39:27,300
sell somebody on something. It's really
strange. But you know, have five brothers,

1913
01:39:27,301 --> 01:39:29,910
none of them work for anyone.
They're all entrepreneurs.

1914
01:39:29,911 --> 01:39:32,980
They all have their own businesses.
They'll either know,

1915
01:39:33,820 --> 01:39:36,420
my brother has his own pharmacies
already got two pharmacies.

1916
01:39:36,420 --> 01:39:40,080
One of my other brothers
sells life insurance and
he's like the top salesman in

1917
01:39:40,081 --> 01:39:42,570
the country.
But other brothers sells real estate.

1918
01:39:43,020 --> 01:39:45,420
No one wanted to work for anyone else.
Partly,

1919
01:39:45,421 --> 01:39:48,030
I think it's just part of in the DNA
that you just don't want to be under

1920
01:39:48,031 --> 01:39:52,530
someone else's thumb. It's
kind of why, you know, if I
come up against guild roles,

1921
01:39:52,531 --> 01:39:55,500
I disliked suddenly get abrasive.
I don't know why, but it's just,

1922
01:39:55,610 --> 01:39:58,800
it's just cause it's in the DNA.
You just can't work for somebody else.

1923
01:39:59,280 --> 01:40:00,750
And I noticed that in my kids too.

1924
01:40:00,760 --> 01:40:02,730
So you'll narrow it to be able to
know to work with somebody else.

1925
01:40:02,731 --> 01:40:05,910
I'll try to teach them early how to
innovate thrown jobs because they're gonna

1926
01:40:06,090 --> 01:40:10,800
get more satisfaction out of writing
their own ticket. As busy as I am.

1927
01:40:10,801 --> 01:40:13,140
It's kind of fun to go
back and look and go, wow,

1928
01:40:13,830 --> 01:40:17,190
I created every job that I have
right now. I've, I my own problem.

1929
01:40:17,220 --> 01:40:20,000
I have all this work to do
because I created every down.

1930
01:40:20,001 --> 01:40:21,690
But no one's asking me for this.

1931
01:40:21,930 --> 01:40:25,590
I'm asking myself to deliver this stuff
cause I've put that responsibility on

1932
01:40:25,591 --> 01:40:26,670
myself.
That's a great freedom.

1933
01:40:26,940 --> 01:40:30,060
That's feels like a great success to
be able to live the life you want,

1934
01:40:30,690 --> 01:40:33,420
be able to carve out so
much time for your family.

1935
01:40:33,421 --> 01:40:38,421
And relationships and people can still
come and say you're the busiest person I

1936
01:40:39,061 --> 01:40:40,650
know in new, Oh wow. I'm not really,

1937
01:40:40,651 --> 01:40:43,020
I'm really finding a way
to put it all together.

1938
01:40:43,021 --> 01:40:44,370
I really learned that from my father.

1939
01:40:44,371 --> 01:40:47,760
So I think immediately people that
I knew and I still read his little

1940
01:40:47,761 --> 01:40:51,300
entrepreneur magazines he had and
thought that sounds so cool. Wow.

1941
01:40:51,301 --> 01:40:54,640
So I'm going to put video games machines
in the back of a truck and drove it

1942
01:40:54,641 --> 01:40:56,230
around to the balls and
made money doing that.

1943
01:40:56,230 --> 01:41:00,100
I mean I was always inspired by these
entrepreneurial stories of people finding

1944
01:41:00,101 --> 01:41:04,480
another way to go instead of following
everybody else and finding success and

1945
01:41:04,481 --> 01:41:06,240
happiness. So, um,

1946
01:41:06,310 --> 01:41:11,310
several people to me are those who kind
of put it all together because if you,

1947
01:41:11,380 --> 01:41:16,380
you can have business success and job
security and be miserable and your

1948
01:41:18,311 --> 01:41:22,660
personal life or have that always fallen
apart or some crisis always happening

1949
01:41:23,050 --> 01:41:26,380
and I'm eating it up, I'm loving it,
you know? And I got that from my father.

1950
01:41:26,381 --> 01:41:28,840
We had such great relationships
in the family and it spilled over.

1951
01:41:29,290 --> 01:41:33,010
My kids now are getting older and I love
when they call me in six me and say,

1952
01:41:33,011 --> 01:41:33,940
Dad,
can we talk?

1953
01:41:34,390 --> 01:41:38,440
And they want advice and you get to
go be dad and you give them all the

1954
01:41:38,441 --> 01:41:40,540
strategies you've learned and
now they make sense to them.

1955
01:41:40,541 --> 01:41:43,900
Even though you've told them as they
grow up now they can apply it and you're

1956
01:41:43,901 --> 01:41:45,970
just like, wow, this,

1957
01:41:46,030 --> 01:41:51,030
I wish I learned this when I was their
age and I look how far I have not knowing

1958
01:41:51,041 --> 01:41:51,190
it.

1959
01:41:51,190 --> 01:41:54,760
Imagine how far they could go and it's
really been able to give that gift back

1960
01:41:54,761 --> 01:41:57,970
to people and your children
and the next generation.

1961
01:41:57,971 --> 01:42:00,430
That's been the most fulfilling,
the most exciting.

1962
01:42:00,431 --> 01:42:04,240
The most stuff I journal is about
that. You know, like wow, really,

1963
01:42:04,720 --> 01:42:07,690
really profound stuff.
It's like shit I just learned last week.

1964
01:42:07,691 --> 01:42:10,060
I'm getting applied to them and they're
getting to learn it and they're like

1965
01:42:10,061 --> 01:42:12,910
jumping ahead like 10
steps. It's like, wow.

1966
01:42:13,570 --> 01:42:18,430
If you could have a billboard anywhere,
uh,

1967
01:42:18,940 --> 01:42:22,810
could have text, visuals, whatever. Where
would you put it in? What would it say?

1968
01:42:24,790 --> 01:42:25,940
It's like kind of questions,

1969
01:42:26,220 --> 01:42:29,570
but when I would do interviews to have
it asked the same question over and over

1970
01:42:29,571 --> 01:42:32,000
and you get so bored with them, but then
somebody gives you an original question,

1971
01:42:32,001 --> 01:42:35,390
you're stumped because you're like,
I'm not used to answering that question.

1972
01:42:35,830 --> 01:42:38,570
Let's go back to the easy ones.
If I could.

1973
01:42:38,600 --> 01:42:40,250
What's the best answer
you've heard for that?

1974
01:42:41,770 --> 01:42:45,190
Oh, what's the best answer
I've heard for that? Let's see,

1975
01:42:47,230 --> 01:42:49,090
I might be conflating the two answers.

1976
01:42:49,091 --> 01:42:53,460
I interviewed generally general Stan
Mcchrystal recently a four star general.

1977
01:42:53,461 --> 01:42:54,610
He used to run Jay sock.

1978
01:42:54,611 --> 01:42:58,870
So basically all the special
forces in Afghanistan and Iraq. Uh,

1979
01:42:59,710 --> 01:43:03,910
and it might've been his favorite quote.
I might be confusing the two answers,

1980
01:43:03,911 --> 01:43:08,440
but he said the, the, uh, the purpose
of life is a life with purpose.

1981
01:43:09,190 --> 01:43:13,540
I was quite a big fan of
that. Uh, Brian Johnson also,

1982
01:43:14,140 --> 01:43:18,040
I started coming called brain tree and
sold it for $800 million to in cash to

1983
01:43:18,041 --> 01:43:21,100
Ebay. Uh, had a good answer to this
and I'm blanking on at the moment,

1984
01:43:21,101 --> 01:43:22,600
but what are your thoughts?

1985
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:26,920
Um, that was one that I did that I said
earlier. He said, oh, I like that quote.

1986
01:43:26,921 --> 01:43:31,390
That's one that I say a lot to people
is, is don't be a, don't follow the herd,

1987
01:43:31,660 --> 01:43:34,660
you know, code. And it's easier
when people are visually can see it.

1988
01:43:34,661 --> 01:43:37,900
But I'm pointing one direction and I
say that even when you hear me talking

1989
01:43:37,901 --> 01:43:41,440
about the network and the network sizzle,
I'll say, if everyone's going that way,

1990
01:43:41,500 --> 01:43:42,333
you know,
like to the left,

1991
01:43:42,460 --> 01:43:45,820
we're going to go this way to the right
because that's how you stumble upon new

1992
01:43:45,821 --> 01:43:50,760
things by just going to down the
unbeaten path, you know, and it's, uh,

1993
01:43:50,990 --> 01:43:54,130
it's always rewarding. Any,
anything in any way you choose.

1994
01:43:54,131 --> 01:43:56,150
And it's just business and
life in general and everything.

1995
01:43:56,510 --> 01:44:00,350
You just go that way and you follow your,
and really cultivating your instincts,

1996
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:03,290
cultivating that instinct so
that you can always rely on that.

1997
01:44:03,290 --> 01:44:05,960
Because if you always have to rely
on the advice of other people,

1998
01:44:05,961 --> 01:44:08,420
which is all good, when they're not
there, you're screwed. You know,

1999
01:44:08,440 --> 01:44:10,130
you gotta be able to follow that,
that inner voice,

2000
01:44:10,160 --> 01:44:14,450
that inner voice and cultivate that
and know when it serves you and when it

2001
01:44:14,451 --> 01:44:17,640
doesn't serve you trust that it's
not serving you just at the moment,

2002
01:44:17,660 --> 01:44:21,740
but it's over the long haul. It's soon
as it's actually in your best interest.

2003
01:44:22,280 --> 01:44:24,770
And if you have that kind of faith
and then you're never stressed,

2004
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:27,710
you're never worried about anything.
One of the things I was teaching,

2005
01:44:27,711 --> 01:44:29,780
my son was very upset about
something and I'm saying,

2006
01:44:30,650 --> 01:44:31,940
I'm going to tell you some secret life.

2007
01:44:31,970 --> 01:44:36,200
You never have to be upset about anything.
Everything is for her purpose.

2008
01:44:36,230 --> 01:44:38,450
You just failed your drivers
test and you were all pissed off.

2009
01:44:38,840 --> 01:44:39,920
I couldn't be happier.

2010
01:44:40,160 --> 01:44:45,160
I'd rather you fail with a teacher and
take it a hundred more times than to go

2011
01:44:45,351 --> 01:44:47,420
fail in front of a cop or turn the wrong,

2012
01:44:47,510 --> 01:44:51,020
make that same mistake and hit somebody.
Now you're 10 days in jail. Right.

2013
01:44:51,350 --> 01:44:55,040
You know, I can't even think
of a negative reason why you,

2014
01:44:55,041 --> 01:44:58,060
you failing that test is a bad thing.
You see how you some really,

2015
01:44:58,070 --> 01:45:02,270
definitely you look at it and the way you
look at it as so important and you can

2016
01:45:02,271 --> 01:45:03,770
have a positive attitude and look at it.

2017
01:45:03,771 --> 01:45:05,510
Well let me see what
I can learn from this.

2018
01:45:05,990 --> 01:45:10,850
Why would you ever get upset
about anything? And he was
like, wow, so much sense.

2019
01:45:10,851 --> 01:45:12,800
I'm so excited about that as a damn.

2020
01:45:12,801 --> 01:45:16,190
I got to make sure I apply that in myself
though cause I'm sure I'm still get

2021
01:45:16,191 --> 01:45:19,310
upset about something and then there's
no reason why you upset why something

2022
01:45:19,311 --> 01:45:21,800
didn't go according to plan.
It might be for good reason,

2023
01:45:21,801 --> 01:45:25,000
but this let's make something out
of that. You know, let's take,

2024
01:45:25,400 --> 01:45:26,930
let's take the good out of that.
I've always,

2025
01:45:27,020 --> 01:45:28,760
I still tried to apply that all the time.

2026
01:45:29,180 --> 01:45:31,520
Never worry when a friend of mine came
to visit me on the set, we're shooting,

2027
01:45:31,521 --> 01:45:34,550
it's a television season finale
for dusk till dawn. It's huge.

2028
01:45:34,551 --> 01:45:38,300
I mean I had them add more and more stuff
to it. I wanted it to be big, bonkers,

2029
01:45:38,301 --> 01:45:42,620
more stunts and ever really deliver and
he couldn't believe that I'm sitting

2030
01:45:42,621 --> 01:45:46,220
behind the monitor playing guitar,
which I do on the set.

2031
01:45:46,221 --> 01:45:48,860
I play the guitar because it keeps me
from pacing and it keeps me from getting

2032
01:45:48,861 --> 01:45:52,960
riled up or stressed. And I'm also writing
score at the same time. Subliminally.

2033
01:45:52,970 --> 01:45:55,460
Sometimes it ends up being the score.
People go, what are you playing? You know,

2034
01:45:55,461 --> 01:45:57,680
I like that. Oh, I don't know.
Maybe it's the theme man.

2035
01:45:58,020 --> 01:46:02,660
And we recorded him real quick and
I would be so stressed, you know,

2036
01:46:02,661 --> 01:46:06,770
doing this if I was like, no, no, there's
no reason to be stressed. Why? Well,

2037
01:46:06,771 --> 01:46:09,710
something might go wrong.
So if it goes wrong,

2038
01:46:09,711 --> 01:46:13,310
you figure out how to make it right.
It's really, I mean, you being stressed,

2039
01:46:13,311 --> 01:46:16,010
is it going to be getting any better?
In fact, you want to be cool breeze,

2040
01:46:16,011 --> 01:46:18,440
so otherwise you're not gonna be
able to think of very, very well.

2041
01:46:18,890 --> 01:46:21,530
Why not enjoy the shoot?
Why you might be maniac.

2042
01:46:21,770 --> 01:46:26,330
And I realized how it's totally the
opposite of what you would expect on

2043
01:46:26,331 --> 01:46:27,350
something that fast.
Well,

2044
01:46:27,351 --> 01:46:31,100
you have to shoot that quick and every
dollar counts that you would be playing

2045
01:46:31,110 --> 01:46:35,030
the guitar kind of softly in between
Susan and everybody and keeping the

2046
01:46:35,031 --> 01:46:38,700
creativity flowing in between takes.
That's why I have my actors paint a team,

2047
01:46:38,701 --> 01:46:42,860
actors how to paint, um, in between
takes because sometimes they'll say,

2048
01:46:42,880 --> 01:46:45,740
I don't know how to pay me. Like, no,
that's bullshit. You new creative already.

2049
01:46:46,040 --> 01:46:48,770
You can paint just as easily
as you can act or do anything.

2050
01:46:48,771 --> 01:46:51,090
And I'm going show you here,
pick any colors,

2051
01:46:51,660 --> 01:46:53,700
I'll show you different ways you can
apply. You apply it any way you want.

2052
01:46:53,701 --> 01:46:56,040
And I'm gonna take a photograph of you
and character. We're going to transfer,

2053
01:46:56,041 --> 01:46:58,920
align, drying it. Mostly your painting
will come through in the face.

2054
01:46:58,921 --> 01:47:01,620
Maybe we'll smoke out the eyes or
something. It'll be done. It'll be a wrap.

2055
01:47:01,621 --> 01:47:05,800
Present us cocreating a character of
yourself to show him to blow you away.

2056
01:47:05,801 --> 01:47:08,130
And I'd love to see them and
they're blown away because,

2057
01:47:08,410 --> 01:47:10,860
and they just trust it now because
they've seen the other ones.

2058
01:47:11,310 --> 01:47:13,530
Lady Gaga has Bruce
Willis is when they go,

2059
01:47:13,531 --> 01:47:17,030
like obviously this guy knows what he's
talking about so and they'd be in there

2060
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:19,140
for free and it's easier now.

2061
01:47:19,290 --> 01:47:22,290
Everybody already knows they can do it
because they see everyone else does it

2062
01:47:22,710 --> 01:47:25,070
and you don't have to train as
much. It's really cool. I mean,

2063
01:47:25,080 --> 01:47:27,630
people don't have to unlearn anything and
you'd teach them a new thing like that.

2064
01:47:28,080 --> 01:47:32,640
It's a relief to know that you
don't have to be hesitant and um,

2065
01:47:32,810 --> 01:47:36,630
and then you want them to bring that back
to the set because usually you'd call

2066
01:47:36,631 --> 01:47:39,270
cut, they have to go to their trailer,
they sit there and not being creative,

2067
01:47:39,271 --> 01:47:40,410
they're on the phone or whatever.

2068
01:47:40,770 --> 01:47:43,170
Then you're having them come back to
the set and suddenly be creative again.

2069
01:47:43,410 --> 01:47:44,790
This keeps them in a creative flow.

2070
01:47:45,650 --> 01:47:48,630
It's whether they're thinking about
solving problems with a different side of

2071
01:47:48,631 --> 01:47:51,090
their creative grain that they're
not even utilizing while act. It's,

2072
01:47:51,100 --> 01:47:54,270
it's amazing. It's a whole other side.
So when they come back to the set,

2073
01:47:54,271 --> 01:47:57,350
you can tell there's a
problem here with a table.

2074
01:47:57,560 --> 01:48:01,470
The cards slide all the way
across and it's not going to work.

2075
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:05,100
You figure it out in two seconds cause
you've already been solving creative

2076
01:48:05,101 --> 01:48:07,920
problems and the other room much more
like what color to use and how much

2077
01:48:07,921 --> 01:48:10,600
breaststroke to use so that this is like,
oh well this is simple hair.

2078
01:48:10,620 --> 01:48:13,050
Just toss them anywhere you want and we'll
erase it there and make it land where

2079
01:48:13,051 --> 01:48:15,590
we want and we're, we'll put them in
the place and that'd be fine. I love it.

2080
01:48:15,780 --> 01:48:19,020
It's like no one really smart.
That's very clever.

2081
01:48:19,470 --> 01:48:21,990
I want to be respectful of your time.
I'm having so much fun.

2082
01:48:21,991 --> 01:48:22,801
I can lose track of time,

2083
01:48:22,801 --> 01:48:27,801
but I would love to ask some questions
from fans who have submitted things.

2084
01:48:29,020 --> 01:48:32,610
Visa, did you do that? You, uh, did
you, how did you get the questions?

2085
01:48:32,611 --> 01:48:36,690
So I gathered the questions by
pulling them on Twitter and Facebook,

2086
01:48:36,870 --> 01:48:40,110
but do you send out an announcement on
Twitter and Facebook saying Robert's

2087
01:48:40,111 --> 01:48:42,630
coming in and then they said,
if you could ask anything?

2088
01:48:42,631 --> 01:48:46,620
I think I usually phrase it one of two
ways. I'll say either a, if you could ask,

2089
01:48:46,990 --> 01:48:49,680
you know, at Rodriguez anything, what
would you like to ask him? For instance,

2090
01:48:49,681 --> 01:48:53,100
I might phrase it that way and I think
that that might've been when I put out

2091
01:48:53,550 --> 01:48:54,850
and uh,

2092
01:48:54,851 --> 01:48:57,960
then I will get answers back on both
Twitter and Facebook that the beauty of

2093
01:48:57,961 --> 01:49:01,070
Facebook, and I've also done this via
something called Google moderator,

2094
01:49:01,080 --> 01:49:03,520
which is going to get shut down,
but people on Facebook and it can,

2095
01:49:03,521 --> 01:49:05,550
it can up vote the questions that like,

2096
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:08,840
so you basically get to see at
the top five most popular. Uh,

2097
01:49:08,900 --> 01:49:11,940
so this question is from Mike.
Les,

2098
01:49:12,240 --> 01:49:15,780
what do most people not
realize, not realize, excuse me,

2099
01:49:15,810 --> 01:49:18,040
about filmmaking until
they become filmmakers?

2100
01:49:20,280 --> 01:49:21,330
How much work it is.

2101
01:49:21,630 --> 01:49:25,980
I put out a book called rebel without
a crew to demystify the process,

2102
01:49:25,981 --> 01:49:28,470
but also to say,
here is a 10 minute film school.

2103
01:49:28,590 --> 01:49:32,850
All you need to know is in 10 minutes.
It's not true, but it is true in a way.

2104
01:49:33,690 --> 01:49:34,830
It said,
you just got to start.

2105
01:49:35,250 --> 01:49:38,700
I didn't put in there the mind
numbing work that goes into it,

2106
01:49:38,750 --> 01:49:40,380
that the soul crushing lows,

2107
01:49:40,500 --> 01:49:43,770
you'll experience trying to realize
your vision because I know you'll figure

2108
01:49:43,771 --> 01:49:46,160
that out on the way.
And I know that it'll really,

2109
01:49:46,161 --> 01:49:49,240
we'll separate those from her going to
be doers and were those who are donors.

2110
01:49:49,270 --> 01:49:53,110
You know, you're going to either figure
out this is for me or this isn't for me.

2111
01:49:53,170 --> 01:49:56,960
It's good it cause it's really, I remember
my short film bedhead short films,

2112
01:49:56,980 --> 01:49:59,880
eight minutes to credits are going
and finally finished the credits.

2113
01:49:59,890 --> 01:50:02,230
I was tears in my eyes.
I was so spent,

2114
01:50:02,980 --> 01:50:05,350
and it's a little short
films so you can imagine how,

2115
01:50:05,380 --> 01:50:09,910
how much it takes out of you to birth
something you know from originally from

2116
01:50:09,911 --> 01:50:13,450
your gut. You know, it really takes
a lot. You can never explain that.

2117
01:50:13,480 --> 01:50:18,040
So I don't try. I just Kinda say send
people on their way, inspire him,

2118
01:50:18,041 --> 01:50:20,410
let him go and they'll
figure it out pretty quick.

2119
01:50:20,411 --> 01:50:22,240
They'll come back with this
look in their eye like,

2120
01:50:22,241 --> 01:50:23,710
what the hell did I just go through?

2121
01:50:24,250 --> 01:50:28,060
And they'll either be invigorated by
that in some way or inspired by that or

2122
01:50:28,061 --> 01:50:29,260
they'll just know that's not for them.

2123
01:50:29,530 --> 01:50:30,850
And that's kind of what
will separate them.

2124
01:50:30,880 --> 01:50:33,940
I wouldn't want to tell people
this is too much for you.

2125
01:50:34,240 --> 01:50:38,230
Let them decide that you know, this is
really tough to go on. This could really,

2126
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:41,350
you could spend a lot of time and money
on something that's never going to go

2127
01:50:41,351 --> 01:50:43,730
off the ground.
I let them figure that out and they'll,

2128
01:50:43,780 --> 01:50:44,890
they'll figure that out pretty quick.

2129
01:50:46,240 --> 01:50:50,390
This is from cure as Sen.

2130
01:50:50,990 --> 01:50:55,270
Uh, what do you have in common with
the main characters in your movies?

2131
01:50:55,360 --> 01:50:59,950
Anything from family structure to outfit,
etc. Yeah,

2132
01:50:59,951 --> 01:51:04,360
the movies always when you
write an original character
very much as a reflection

2133
01:51:04,361 --> 01:51:06,390
of who you are in a lot of ways.
And I'm,

2134
01:51:06,391 --> 01:51:09,400
I'm all out of the characters
on the girls. I'm the men. Um,

2135
01:51:09,401 --> 01:51:13,390
there's this pieces of me and all of them,
this pieces of yourself that kind of,

2136
01:51:13,600 --> 01:51:16,870
it's kind of why sometimes I like to do
movies that I didn't write just to get

2137
01:51:16,871 --> 01:51:19,330
out of yourself for a while cause then
you'll tend to write some of their

2138
01:51:19,331 --> 01:51:20,164
characters.

2139
01:51:20,230 --> 01:51:22,960
They're always kind of rule breakers are
always kind of doing their own thing.

2140
01:51:23,490 --> 01:51:26,920
Um,
and they always have this sort of,

2141
01:51:26,921 --> 01:51:29,410
this loner type type attitude.
But they're there,

2142
01:51:29,700 --> 01:51:33,160
they realize the greater cause and what
they can bring to it from machete to the

2143
01:51:33,161 --> 01:51:37,300
Desperado to even the spike is a spike.
It's probably the closest to my family.

2144
01:51:37,301 --> 01:51:39,520
I really wanted to make a
movie based on my family,

2145
01:51:39,750 --> 01:51:44,200
the experience of growing up with 10 kids.
So my uncle was a Gregorio,

2146
01:51:44,201 --> 01:51:48,440
it'll degas. He was a special
agent for the, um, for the, uh,

2147
01:51:49,180 --> 01:51:53,590
FBI brought down to a top 10 criminals.
And um,

2148
01:51:55,060 --> 01:51:55,960
he,
uh,

2149
01:51:55,990 --> 01:52:00,990
by based Gregorio Cortez played 20 Bandura
on him and my brother and my sisters

2150
01:52:01,030 --> 01:52:04,630
names are in there as the two brothers
and sisters. My uncle Felix when uncle,

2151
01:52:05,140 --> 01:52:07,520
it's like my whole family is
told in the spike in movie.

2152
01:52:07,521 --> 01:52:10,750
So that was very satisfying to kind of
be able to tell your family story hidden

2153
01:52:11,110 --> 01:52:12,010
in a spy film.

2154
01:52:12,100 --> 01:52:16,480
But it's really how we got along with
my siblings and the whole dynamic and my

2155
01:52:16,481 --> 01:52:19,870
family, uh, done in a
way. Sometimes it's very,

2156
01:52:19,871 --> 01:52:24,190
it's very obvious like that and
other times it's kind of just hidden.

2157
01:52:24,220 --> 01:52:28,720
Just you know, everybody from the
Johnny Depp character where you know,

2158
01:52:28,721 --> 01:52:30,970
he rigged the games constantly.
So he wins.

2159
01:52:30,971 --> 01:52:34,420
My kids say that's me all the time that
line up. He says, Hey, it's not cheating.

2160
01:52:34,421 --> 01:52:38,440
It's creative sportsmanship. That's what
my kids always say when I, when death,

2161
01:52:38,441 --> 01:52:39,340
not cheating instance,

2162
01:52:39,360 --> 01:52:43,920
create a sportsmanship when I beat him at
a game cause Ben some role in my favor,

2163
01:52:44,300 --> 01:52:46,850
they're entertained by that.
They're not, don't feel bad.

2164
01:52:46,851 --> 01:52:49,190
They actually look forward to the hell.
I'm going to bend the rules.

2165
01:52:51,440 --> 01:52:52,273
Uh,

2166
01:52:52,880 --> 01:52:57,880
this is for Lawrence Fabro I
think rot sounds like Jon Favreau.

2167
01:52:58,461 --> 01:52:59,600
He was on this podcast as well.

2168
01:52:59,630 --> 01:53:02,740
Really Fun guys cause he contributed some
questions to you. Is a great guy. Yeah.

2169
01:53:02,780 --> 01:53:06,290
Great Guy. Uh, what do you
geeking out on right now?

2170
01:53:06,320 --> 01:53:07,760
What do you think is fucking cool

2171
01:53:08,790 --> 01:53:12,320
kicking down on written?
Gosh,

2172
01:53:12,321 --> 01:53:14,910
I think of a good answer is it's
so many different little things.

2173
01:53:14,911 --> 01:53:18,420
Like I just figured out that there were
all these other sounds were available.

2174
01:53:18,421 --> 01:53:21,960
All these other patches were available
to me did I never noticed before on the

2175
01:53:21,961 --> 01:53:26,961
amp settings on my pro tools setting for
at any function that I didn't like at

2176
01:53:27,901 --> 01:53:31,530
first because it replaced one that didn't
get upgraded with a new system and I

2177
01:53:31,531 --> 01:53:33,930
was just pissed.
I was trying to record some music and,

2178
01:53:34,350 --> 01:53:37,710
and get a sound that I was looking for
and in this thing seem really limited and

2179
01:53:37,711 --> 01:53:40,200
then suddenly I found a button I didn't
know existed because I never read the

2180
01:53:40,201 --> 01:53:43,260
instructions and this whole
menu of things that are locked,

2181
01:53:43,320 --> 01:53:46,740
I have to go and lock them and brought
it to go pay some price but it's just so

2182
01:53:46,741 --> 01:53:48,330
tantalizing and go,
oh my God,

2183
01:53:48,331 --> 01:53:52,560
what sounds are going to be there that
I can go some geeking out over something

2184
01:53:52,561 --> 01:53:55,020
that um,
I guess to summarize,

2185
01:53:55,410 --> 01:53:59,940
when I first started I would take the
two VCRs and hook them together and edit

2186
01:53:59,941 --> 01:54:01,950
my movies that way.
And I would use every function,

2187
01:54:01,980 --> 01:54:04,080
milk it for everything that it could do.

2188
01:54:04,650 --> 01:54:07,230
If people would be shocked at what I
was able to get these machines to do,

2189
01:54:07,231 --> 01:54:10,590
cause I would take any little function
that was a positive and I would use it in

2190
01:54:10,591 --> 01:54:12,900
a way my movies now,
it's completely the opposite.

2191
01:54:13,110 --> 01:54:16,080
You only scratching the surface of
every one of these applications.

2192
01:54:16,410 --> 01:54:19,320
You could go down the wormhole and
stayed there for quite a while.

2193
01:54:19,560 --> 01:54:22,680
Just trying to figure out all the things
that each one of these programs is

2194
01:54:22,681 --> 01:54:23,514
capable of.

2195
01:54:23,580 --> 01:54:27,270
It's mind boggling and you're never
going to take full advantage of them.

2196
01:54:27,300 --> 01:54:29,070
It's the complete
opposite of how I grew up,

2197
01:54:29,520 --> 01:54:32,670
where I was milking everything
for what it was worth. And now,

2198
01:54:33,180 --> 01:54:36,510
no matter how deep I go into it,
it can do so much more.

2199
01:54:36,511 --> 01:54:38,850
And it drives you crazy where there's
just not enough hours in the day.

2200
01:54:39,020 --> 01:54:42,690
It's just not enough hours in the day
to kick out or things stuff with my kids

2201
01:54:42,691 --> 01:54:45,030
just, you know, the gaming world.
We'd love playing games together.

2202
01:54:45,330 --> 01:54:46,530
Any favorite game to play together?

2203
01:54:46,700 --> 01:54:49,770
Well we still kind of playing some of
the old games again and again we're

2204
01:54:49,771 --> 01:54:50,880
looking forward to um,

2205
01:54:52,170 --> 01:54:55,290
we were playing actually all the old halos
again cause they grew up. Some of the,

2206
01:54:55,291 --> 01:54:59,070
a lot of the stuff we do is the, is
the uh, the stylistic stuff cause they,

2207
01:54:59,080 --> 01:55:02,040
they come over to the house and they
want to relive the old days and they love

2208
01:55:02,041 --> 01:55:05,350
that. Some of our favorite old games are
now available. Like even Mario 64 weeks.

2209
01:55:05,351 --> 01:55:08,280
They all grew up on is now
available, you know, better,

2210
01:55:08,500 --> 01:55:12,810
better quality HD st with all the Halos
can go back and play all the halal

2211
01:55:12,811 --> 01:55:16,250
levels, you know, uh, from one
on that they learned on me.

2212
01:55:16,760 --> 01:55:20,760
I'm really clear and crystal when
big screen. So that's been fun.

2213
01:55:20,930 --> 01:55:24,290
What are filmmakers do you feel getting
better at and what are they getting

2214
01:55:24,291 --> 01:55:27,170
worse at?
We can narrow that that a little bit.

2215
01:55:27,200 --> 01:55:31,520
Let's just not say the people who were
out there at the prime of their career,

2216
01:55:31,521 --> 01:55:33,480
but people who are just starting out,
uh,

2217
01:55:33,590 --> 01:55:35,480
what are they getting better at and
what are they getting worse then

2218
01:55:36,300 --> 01:55:37,360
what I think,
um,

2219
01:55:38,530 --> 01:55:43,530
I think is great about what filmmakers
are doing today is utilizing just how

2220
01:55:43,651 --> 01:55:47,040
quickly they use, utilize new technology
and new ways of communication. You know,

2221
01:55:47,041 --> 01:55:51,300
how you broke in the industry when I
started so much different than how you do

2222
01:55:51,301 --> 01:55:55,740
it now. When did the guys,
I'm from Ecuador came in,

2223
01:55:55,750 --> 01:55:59,860
worked on dusk till dawn.
He, uh, he said, yeah,

2224
01:55:59,861 --> 01:56:01,140
there was no production down there.

2225
01:56:01,520 --> 01:56:05,010
I read your book and I went and made a
little short film and I put it on the

2226
01:56:05,011 --> 01:56:06,660
Internet and within,
you know,

2227
01:56:06,810 --> 01:56:11,810
a day it went viral and the studios
were flying me up and he got to make the

2228
01:56:12,030 --> 01:56:15,480
evil dead movies and it was
a fit. Alvarez, the remake.

2229
01:56:15,720 --> 01:56:19,470
And then I got him to direct one of my
episodes and he was like, wow. Yeah,

2230
01:56:19,471 --> 01:56:21,690
I was inspired by that.
You just did it with nothing.

2231
01:56:21,690 --> 01:56:23,460
And I was able to go do it in Ecuador.

2232
01:56:24,870 --> 01:56:27,820
There was no film industry down
there and we just did it. And,

2233
01:56:27,950 --> 01:56:31,200
and I was shocked that I could just put
it on the Internet and they get noticed

2234
01:56:31,201 --> 01:56:33,090
by Hollywood. I mean it's just, no,

2235
01:56:33,091 --> 01:56:36,650
and they'll film festival and that cut
cut all that. It actually just from,

2236
01:56:36,680 --> 01:56:40,710
from another country sends something in,
spreads everywhere,

2237
01:56:41,200 --> 01:56:42,180
gets them noticed.
You know,

2238
01:56:42,181 --> 01:56:45,570
I've seen a lot of people do that now
where they shoot proofs of concepts of

2239
01:56:45,571 --> 01:56:49,980
whole things and then they put them out
for everyone to see and they can make a

2240
01:56:49,981 --> 01:56:52,440
deal that way with the studio. It goes,
this guy knows what he's doing. I mean,

2241
01:56:52,441 --> 01:56:56,780
just really clever way. I think
that's, that's really great. Um,

2242
01:56:56,860 --> 01:57:01,290
how has it gotten worse? Gosh,
I don't know. Were skills
that are getting lost? Oh,

2243
01:57:01,291 --> 01:57:02,250
skills.
Well,

2244
01:57:02,550 --> 01:57:06,950
I mean I was lucky at and
that I got to cut on film. Oh,

2245
01:57:07,050 --> 01:57:11,610
I got to see all the limitations of
the old system. At least kids today,

2246
01:57:11,611 --> 01:57:14,100
they just learn the new system.
So they're often running.

2247
01:57:14,130 --> 01:57:19,130
But I saw the old system and saw just
how much better the new systems where,

2248
01:57:19,501 --> 01:57:24,030
I mean that was the only guy cutting
digitally on the Sony Lot when I did

2249
01:57:24,031 --> 01:57:28,170
desperado though all the other
editors were afraid of it. You know,

2250
01:57:28,171 --> 01:57:30,000
they were just afraid that
it was going to replace them.

2251
01:57:30,750 --> 01:57:33,570
The same with digital photography.
I was first to start shooting digitally.

2252
01:57:33,990 --> 01:57:37,620
You know, dps. We're afraid that was
going to be to their job. You know,

2253
01:57:37,650 --> 01:57:39,890
they'll realize it's just another
tool. It's not, the job isn't,

2254
01:57:39,910 --> 01:57:42,870
isn't the old technology. The
technology is not the art form, right.

2255
01:57:43,230 --> 01:57:46,440
The manipulation and moving images can
happen on a machine or it can happen by

2256
01:57:46,441 --> 01:57:47,820
cutting film.
It's not that.

2257
01:57:47,910 --> 01:57:51,000
It's not the technology that is the
art form and people don't realize,

2258
01:57:51,001 --> 01:57:54,240
I think kids today, it's a good thing
is that they know that, you know,

2259
01:57:54,241 --> 01:57:54,691
they just know,

2260
01:57:54,691 --> 01:57:57,360
they just accept any new thing and
they'll new tool and they'll use it.

2261
01:57:57,690 --> 01:58:01,350
They're not a slave to tradition.
The way the older generation was.

2262
01:58:01,550 --> 01:58:05,580
That held stuff back because you would
see people shooting digital cameras way

2263
01:58:05,581 --> 01:58:08,580
before they shot digital cameras and
Hollywood people were 10 years ahead of

2264
01:58:08,581 --> 01:58:12,770
Hollywood. Always so slow.
That's why I don't live there.

2265
01:58:12,771 --> 01:58:15,420
And that's why we much more
cutting edge and in Austin,

2266
01:58:15,750 --> 01:58:18,930
just cause we're not have any
tradition around us saying, no,

2267
01:58:18,931 --> 01:58:21,900
you're not supposed to do it that way.
We just rethink it. Right. It's like why?

2268
01:58:21,901 --> 01:58:24,590
Why? Why are you even doing it that way?
That doesn't make any sense. This new way.

2269
01:58:24,610 --> 01:58:29,250
Makes Sense. So I really, um,
I think of anything people, uh,

2270
01:58:29,370 --> 01:58:32,450
what people do wrong is when they don't,
um,

2271
01:58:32,560 --> 01:58:36,300
embrace a new technology early enough,
like in the know dps, you know,

2272
01:58:36,301 --> 01:58:37,131
directors of photography,

2273
01:58:37,131 --> 01:58:40,920
we were wrong not to try to embrace
digital photography early enough so it can

2274
01:58:40,930 --> 01:58:44,980
get in there and help try and
define what the look of it would be,

2275
01:58:45,190 --> 01:58:47,230
how the systems would be built.
Now it's too late.

2276
01:58:47,530 --> 01:58:49,510
Now they're all switching
over and complain about it.

2277
01:58:49,990 --> 01:58:52,810
But it's too late now because it's been
adopted and you weren't anywhere near

2278
01:58:52,811 --> 01:58:54,650
you and stuck your head in the sand stage.

2279
01:58:54,670 --> 01:58:57,100
You went and stuck your head in the sand
while everybody else was using the end

2280
01:58:57,101 --> 01:58:58,000
developing.
And now he,

2281
01:58:58,001 --> 01:59:01,030
now he's got a stuck with it and you
could have developed a whole new way of

2282
01:59:01,031 --> 01:59:05,110
photographing movies and human stuck
your head in the sand for 10 years.

2283
01:59:05,610 --> 01:59:08,820
It makes zero sense. So instead
I was like, I told him and I,

2284
01:59:08,830 --> 01:59:11,980
and that's why it has a hot dog holder
next to it because that was important to

2285
01:59:11,981 --> 01:59:14,510
me.
Uh,

2286
01:59:14,800 --> 01:59:17,080
what advice last last two questions.

2287
01:59:17,380 --> 01:59:22,120
What advice would you give to
your 30 year old self? Wow.

2288
01:59:22,150 --> 01:59:24,840
30 year old self.
I see that I have anything figured out,

2289
01:59:24,841 --> 01:59:28,960
but 30 got know any of the advice
that I've been giving my kids.

2290
01:59:29,050 --> 01:59:33,230
I wish I had heard at 30, 35, 40. Um,

2291
01:59:33,580 --> 01:59:38,560
18. I mean, I um, I always
learn new new techniques,

2292
01:59:38,561 --> 01:59:40,270
new things,
new ways to do things better.

2293
01:59:40,510 --> 01:59:43,390
And I always try to apply them and I
always wish I just knew more back then

2294
01:59:43,570 --> 01:59:48,070
being just more self aware. Um, but then
again, sometimes you look back and you go,

2295
01:59:48,520 --> 01:59:51,850
being naive and not knowing
was probably the best gift.

2296
01:59:51,851 --> 01:59:53,980
Sometimes you know too much,
you know,

2297
01:59:53,981 --> 01:59:58,280
you know too much and then you stop
doing things. It's better not to know.

2298
01:59:58,430 --> 02:00:02,260
You know, I try to, I always try to be,
you know, there's just that example of,

2299
02:00:02,261 --> 02:00:04,750
you know, you ask a bunch of
little kids who can do anything,

2300
02:00:04,751 --> 02:00:06,790
who could be the president, who
can write an opera, who can paint,

2301
02:00:07,090 --> 02:00:09,280
who can be a filmmaker and they'll raise
their hand because they don't know.

2302
02:00:09,850 --> 02:00:12,760
They all just believe they can and he
has the same kids in 10 years and the

2303
02:00:12,761 --> 02:00:16,330
hands started going down. No
life experience. They just
start, stopped believing.

2304
02:00:16,780 --> 02:00:18,940
I always try to be that kid who has
his hand up in the air. It's like,

2305
02:00:18,941 --> 02:00:21,700
can you write a score to a movie with a
hundred piece orchestra even though you

2306
02:00:21,701 --> 02:00:25,090
don't read or write music? Sure. I still
do it. And you do it and you're like,

2307
02:00:25,091 --> 02:00:27,250
how the fuck did I do that? Well,
because you were being creative.

2308
02:00:27,430 --> 02:00:30,670
The technical part of the was
just 10% you can fudge that.

2309
02:00:30,700 --> 02:00:32,740
Some of the best musicians don't
know how to read or write music.

2310
02:00:33,100 --> 02:00:34,590
You can fudge all of that stuff.
I mean,

2311
02:00:34,591 --> 02:00:38,200
you know how to be creative if you
keep your hand up. Can you do this?

2312
02:00:38,201 --> 02:00:42,250
Can you do that? Yeah. Yeah.
Who is it? How do I know? I
can't until I try it. Okay.

2313
02:00:42,251 --> 02:00:43,110
Maybe I'm not that good at it,

2314
02:00:43,120 --> 02:00:45,250
but I can still do it and I can
probably learn to be better.

2315
02:00:45,251 --> 02:00:49,270
And if I surround myself by masters,
I'll get better a lot faster. Um,

2316
02:00:49,990 --> 02:00:51,370
so, um, yeah,

2317
02:00:51,400 --> 02:00:56,400
I guess I would just go back and follow
my own good advice more than anything.

2318
02:00:57,280 --> 02:01:00,220
Sometimes I have, I think we all
inherently know what we're supposed to do.

2319
02:01:00,221 --> 02:01:03,360
We just don't always do
it. Um, so I think, uh,

2320
02:01:03,880 --> 02:01:07,000
if we were just to open our mouths
in a way to go teach somebody,

2321
02:01:07,001 --> 02:01:10,370
we would end up giving some very profound
advice that we would be writing down

2322
02:01:10,371 --> 02:01:14,020
and going, I need to go make sure I'm
doing that. I remember someone said to me,

2323
02:01:14,050 --> 02:01:17,340
or I might've read this, you know,
wisdom is taking your own advice. It is,

2324
02:01:17,350 --> 02:01:20,320
it totally is. Because sometimes you
give advice, but that's, but that's why,

2325
02:01:20,321 --> 02:01:22,390
cause they advice doesn't
really come from you. You know,

2326
02:01:22,391 --> 02:01:25,960
when you go to open your mouth and
you move forward in a positive way to

2327
02:01:25,961 --> 02:01:29,230
enlighten someone, the enlightenment
comes and it's not from you,

2328
02:01:29,231 --> 02:01:30,250
it just coming through you.

2329
02:01:30,670 --> 02:01:33,760
So you need to write that down cause
it's as much for you as it is for them.

2330
02:01:33,910 --> 02:01:38,180
It's why I love teaching because I
know I'll learn more teaching than um,

2331
02:01:38,530 --> 02:01:41,090
then from my students because
it's not coming from me. Yeah.

2332
02:01:42,240 --> 02:01:44,940
The ask,
I would like you to,

2333
02:01:45,090 --> 02:01:49,230
if you could make one ask or
request of people listening to this,

2334
02:01:49,530 --> 02:01:50,363
what would it be?

2335
02:01:53,150 --> 02:01:57,460
If I can make one ask.
Oh,

2336
02:01:57,461 --> 02:02:00,520
besides look for the El Rey network in
any of the programming that's on there.

2337
02:02:00,640 --> 02:02:00,791
Oh,

2338
02:02:00,791 --> 02:02:05,620
it asks that you just try and live as
creatively as possible because that's the,

2339
02:02:05,680 --> 02:02:08,920
that's the unknown. That's the
gift you can bring to the table.

2340
02:02:09,280 --> 02:02:12,310
That could change everything.
Even if you don't think you're creative.

2341
02:02:12,320 --> 02:02:16,150
Everyone inherently is creative and
there's people who block themselves

2342
02:02:16,151 --> 02:02:19,510
immediately by saying, oh,
I'm not creative. And um,

2343
02:02:19,570 --> 02:02:22,090
well of course you're not going to be
creative if that's your belief in who you

2344
02:02:22,091 --> 02:02:22,924
are.
So far.

2345
02:02:22,960 --> 02:02:27,040
Apply creativity and you'll see into
everything and you'll see you just become

2346
02:02:27,041 --> 02:02:28,990
more creative because you're applying.
It's everything.

2347
02:02:29,320 --> 02:02:32,230
Everything is an opportunity to
be creative. I'm creative all day.

2348
02:02:32,231 --> 02:02:37,231
There's nothing I do that doesn't
involve creativity from making a meal to

2349
02:02:37,271 --> 02:02:40,190
satisfy my kids and had interest is way,
it's creative right there.

2350
02:02:40,191 --> 02:02:43,750
I'm going to figure out a rice dish
that's not going to be rice is going to be

2351
02:02:43,751 --> 02:02:45,880
tasting that they're going to crave,
that's going to be good for them.

2352
02:02:46,180 --> 02:02:48,870
That's creativity in itself.
And it's nutrition.

2353
02:02:48,880 --> 02:02:50,710
You're gonna really apply
creativity to everything.

2354
02:02:50,711 --> 02:02:52,930
And just the Games we play when
we were stuck at the airport,

2355
02:02:53,320 --> 02:02:57,490
you're being creative. You know, how you
journal things, how you cross reference,

2356
02:02:57,491 --> 02:03:01,470
how you present things to them, how
you, um, inspire your crew, hiring,

2357
02:03:01,480 --> 02:03:05,080
inspire you or other people around you
have inspire yourself. It's all creative.

2358
02:03:05,530 --> 02:03:06,700
And if you say you're not creative,

2359
02:03:06,701 --> 02:03:09,700
look how much you're missing out on
just because you've told yourself that.

2360
02:03:10,180 --> 02:03:12,850
So I think creativity is one of the
greatest gifts that were born with it.

2361
02:03:12,851 --> 02:03:14,020
Some people don't cultivate that.

2362
02:03:14,021 --> 02:03:17,260
They don't realize could be applied
to literally everything in their life.

2363
02:03:17,800 --> 02:03:22,360
I found out that the most fulfilled,
happiest, most productive. When I'm happy,

2364
02:03:22,390 --> 02:03:25,160
when I'm creative and that's when I'm,
I'm sending my best.

2365
02:03:25,161 --> 02:03:28,870
So I try to do that 24 hours
a day, 24, seven, be creative,

2366
02:03:28,930 --> 02:03:32,050
take everything creatively. This is
an opportunity and would to be here,

2367
02:03:32,051 --> 02:03:35,200
sit down and be creative with you.
Be Creative in how we presented ideas,

2368
02:03:35,500 --> 02:03:38,680
how we got these ideas out
to the audience. And a,

2369
02:03:38,681 --> 02:03:43,330
and this was a full exercise
in creativity. So I'm,

2370
02:03:43,390 --> 02:03:47,200
I'm about to go meet with my God daughter
and go try to be creative and figure

2371
02:03:47,201 --> 02:03:50,470
out how she can learn some skills she
needs to learn and she's a little behind

2372
02:03:50,950 --> 02:03:54,280
and you go, this is an opportunity to
creatively kind of inspired and do stuff.

2373
02:03:54,281 --> 02:03:56,860
You know, you constantly are
using creativity all the time.

2374
02:03:57,810 --> 02:04:00,960
I um, I love what you do. Uh,

2375
02:04:00,990 --> 02:04:05,070
people should also check out your Texas
barbecue recipe. You have instruction.

2376
02:04:05,340 --> 02:04:08,920
It's fantastic. Oh yeah, that's sin city
breakfast tacos. Did you ever see the ice?

2377
02:04:08,921 --> 02:04:13,130
That was really good. Breakfast
Tacos as well. We show the uh,

2378
02:04:13,140 --> 02:04:16,110
the time on the,
on the screen when they're still cutting.

2379
02:04:16,111 --> 02:04:20,430
It's like 4:36 AM I love what
you put out in the world self.

2380
02:04:21,060 --> 02:04:25,770
Everybody. Stay naive, keep a journal,
be creative because whether you,

2381
02:04:25,771 --> 02:04:28,710
whatever you were doing in your
life, uh, you have that opportunity.

2382
02:04:29,220 --> 02:04:31,610
And where can people find you online?

2383
02:04:31,620 --> 02:04:33,830
Find more about what you're
doing on Twitter here. I'm

2384
02:04:33,830 --> 02:04:38,700
an at Rodriguez on Twitter,
I'm on El Rey network.com.

2385
02:04:39,030 --> 02:04:41,580
We're about to start a
whole digital arm of that.

2386
02:04:41,610 --> 02:04:45,690
We're this segment called the people's
network and people will be able to send

2387
02:04:45,691 --> 02:04:49,350
in their own films, short films,
ways to participate with a network,

2388
02:04:49,650 --> 02:04:53,190
become part of the network and
create content in a really cool way.

2389
02:04:53,191 --> 02:04:56,790
Sometimes they'd come all
the way to trouble maker
studios and we just had three

2390
02:04:56,791 --> 02:05:01,530
creators. They're getting to use
all the sets, all the actors,

2391
02:05:01,531 --> 02:05:03,240
all while we were shooting does.

2392
02:05:03,570 --> 02:05:07,470
And it gets so inspired because their
list of things that they have access to

2393
02:05:07,530 --> 02:05:08,520
suddenly jumped

2394
02:05:10,570 --> 02:05:13,440
a little Richie is list of what they used
to have suddenly jumped and they were

2395
02:05:13,441 --> 02:05:17,430
able to, and it was a cool experiment.
We're going to do that a lot more and um,

2396
02:05:17,520 --> 02:05:18,600
and a lot of things they didn't really,

2397
02:05:18,601 --> 02:05:22,410
the digital side of El Ray network now
that we've had the brand is really going

2398
02:05:22,411 --> 02:05:26,880
to be where people can participate
in ways that they don't get to in a

2399
02:05:26,881 --> 02:05:29,220
traditional network. And that
leverage that with, you know,

2400
02:05:29,280 --> 02:05:31,170
they were in 40 million homes,
it's going to be pretty awesome.

2401
02:05:31,171 --> 02:05:32,110
So we're excited about that.
Oh,

2402
02:05:32,111 --> 02:05:37,111
and next year I'm going to be doing him
another $7,000 movie with no crew and

2403
02:05:38,870 --> 02:05:41,160
then there's other people are going to
do it too for that, for that same thing.

2404
02:05:41,161 --> 02:05:43,430
We'll have an announcement about them.
They speak. Great. Well I'll, I'll,

2405
02:05:43,470 --> 02:05:47,640
whenever it's ready, I will
share that as well. So, uh, guys,

2406
02:05:48,360 --> 02:05:52,200
hope you enjoyed this as much as I did
for show notes, links to everything,

2407
02:05:52,201 --> 02:05:54,930
El Ray network,
everything that we discussed in the show.

2408
02:05:54,931 --> 02:05:58,350
Just got a four hour work week.com forward
slash podcast. And until next time,

2409
02:05:58,710 --> 02:06:00,930
thank you for listening. I want to add
and you can cut it in there somewhere.

2410
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:03,510
Yeah I saw someone who just thank
you for what you do because uh,

2411
02:06:03,550 --> 02:06:08,550
demystifying the process so that others
could jumpstart their lives in ways that

2412
02:06:08,581 --> 02:06:09,330
they thought,
you know,

2413
02:06:09,330 --> 02:06:12,750
we didn't have access to something
that I've just always loved doing.

2414
02:06:13,230 --> 02:06:16,410
I've done consistently to the book,
to my DVD commentary,

2415
02:06:16,411 --> 02:06:19,680
to my special 10 minute film
schools just constantly doing it.

2416
02:06:19,681 --> 02:06:23,460
When I saw you doing that in this realm
and in all areas and so many areas,

2417
02:06:23,820 --> 02:06:26,820
I always wanted to meet you cause I
thought it was a very kinship in which you

2418
02:06:26,821 --> 02:06:27,510
do,

2419
02:06:27,510 --> 02:06:30,960
which is real gift that you give people
by putting yourself out there and giving

2420
02:06:30,961 --> 02:06:33,220
them, people always say, why are
you giving away all the secrets?

2421
02:06:33,221 --> 02:06:35,760
Like it won't cause you'll come up with
more secrets and I give the little way

2422
02:06:36,120 --> 02:06:39,360
and it's because I would have wanted
to know that you know, me as a student,

2423
02:06:39,361 --> 02:06:43,590
as a film lover and someone who felt
like I was outside of the industry not

2424
02:06:43,591 --> 02:06:47,250
being able to ever get in,
would have wanted to know
there was a door, there were,

2425
02:06:47,251 --> 02:06:49,140
there was a method or there
was something that I, it's,

2426
02:06:49,141 --> 02:06:52,860
I would have appreciated that someone
telling me that. So that's why I do it.

2427
02:06:53,190 --> 02:06:54,300
And I'm sure you're the same way.

2428
02:06:54,301 --> 02:06:58,440
You just constantly looking for that
juice and when Ian, how can I get it?

2429
02:06:58,650 --> 02:07:00,270
And then you go and you
give that gift to people.

2430
02:07:00,271 --> 02:07:02,640
So I think that's wonderful what you do
and that's why people are here listening.

2431
02:07:03,060 --> 02:07:07,190
Thanks man. Really means a lot. So,
well they will do round two some time.

2432
02:07:07,980 --> 02:07:08,520
Thanks man.

2433
02:07:08,520 --> 02:07:13,120
All right, thanks. Hey guys,

2434
02:07:13,121 --> 02:07:17,050
this is Tim again. Just a few more
things before you take off. Number one,

2435
02:07:17,290 --> 02:07:21,910
this is five bullet Friday.
Do you want to get a short email from me?

2436
02:07:21,911 --> 02:07:26,050
Would you enjoy getting a short email
from me every Friday that provides a

2437
02:07:26,051 --> 02:07:30,010
little morsel of fun before the weekend
and five bullet Friday is a very short

2438
02:07:30,040 --> 02:07:34,540
email where I share the coolest things
I've found or that I've been pondering

2439
02:07:34,541 --> 02:07:38,230
over the, that could include favorite
new albums that I've discovered.

2440
02:07:38,231 --> 02:07:41,680
It could include Gizmos and gadgets
and all sorts of weird shit that I've

2441
02:07:41,681 --> 02:07:45,970
somehow dug up in the other
world of the esoteric as I do.

2442
02:07:46,300 --> 02:07:51,300
It could include favorite articles that
I've read and that I've shared with my

2443
02:07:51,970 --> 02:07:54,670
close friends for instance,
and it's very short.

2444
02:07:54,760 --> 02:07:59,740
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness
before you head off for the weekend.

2445
02:07:59,800 --> 02:08:01,960
So if you want to receive that,

episode is brought to you by 99 designs,

2449
02:08:15,431 --> 02:08:18,730
your one stop shop for all
things graphic design related.

2450
02:08:18,760 --> 02:08:23,740
I've used 99 designs for everything
from banner ads to book covers,

2451
02:08:23,741 --> 02:08:27,430
including sketches and mock ups
that led to the four hour body,

2452
02:08:27,431 --> 02:08:29,890
which later became number
one year times number one,

2453
02:08:29,891 --> 02:08:32,260
Wall Street Journal and the brainstorming.

2454
02:08:32,261 --> 02:08:35,590
A lot of it took place with designers
from around the world and here's how it

2455
02:08:35,591 --> 02:08:39,790
works. Whether you need a t
shirt, a business card, a website,

2456
02:08:40,060 --> 02:08:42,400
an APP thumbnail,
whatever it might be,

2457
02:08:42,580 --> 02:08:46,120
you submit that project and
designers from around the world.

2458
02:08:46,270 --> 02:08:48,760
We'll send you sketches
and mock ups and designs.

2459
02:08:48,940 --> 02:08:52,420
You choose your favorite and you have an
original that you love or you get your

2460
02:08:52,421 --> 02:08:54,130
money back.
It's that straight forward.

2461
02:08:54,460 --> 02:08:57,850
And many of you who are listening have
already used it and created some amazing

2462
02:08:57,851 --> 02:09:00,220
things that I'll be sharing it in
the future. But in the meantime,

Tim this episode is brought to you by
Athletic Greens. I get asked all the time,

2468
02:09:16,631 --> 02:09:18,820
if you could all use one supplement,
what would it be?

2469
02:09:19,100 --> 02:09:21,730
And my answer is
inevitably Athletic Greens,

2470
02:09:21,731 --> 02:09:24,220
it is your all in one
nutritional insurance.

2471
02:09:24,221 --> 02:09:25,900
I recommended it in the four hour body,

2472
02:09:25,990 --> 02:09:29,980
did not get paid for that and I
travel with it to avoid getting sick.

2473
02:09:30,190 --> 02:09:32,980
I take it in the mornings to
ensure optimal performance.

2474
02:09:33,220 --> 02:09:34,450
It just covers all my basis.

2475
02:09:34,510 --> 02:09:38,470
If I can't get what I need through whole
food meals throughout the rest of the

2476
02:09:38,470 --> 02:09:43,330
day, and you can get 50 oh my
gosh, 50% off. Yes, 50% off.

It's tasty, but more important,

you're doing your nutritional plannings.

2480
02:09:57,410 --> 02:10:00,910
For me, it just covers the
basis, takes a load off my mind,
