1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,890
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02,891 --> 00:00:06,220
I can run flat out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:14,470
I'm a cybernetic organism living tissue.

4
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:28,690
This episode is brought to you by ink
tell and I've used them personally ever

5
00:00:28,691 --> 00:00:30,040
since I wrote the four hour workweek.

6
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:34,150
I've been asked over and over again
how I choose to delegate tasks,

7
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,090
how I do 80 20 analysis and so on.

8
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:41,050
At the root of many of those
decisions is a simple question.

9
00:00:41,051 --> 00:00:42,250
Actually two questions.
Number one,

10
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:45,070
how can I invest money to
improve my quality of life?

11
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:47,770
I use that in investing as well.
The second,

12
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:53,010
how can I spend a little money or moderate
money to save significant time inc

13
00:00:53,501 --> 00:00:55,120
tell is one of those investments.

14
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,200
There are a turnkey solution for all
of your imaginable customer care needs.

15
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,400
I used Intel during the launch of
the four hour body, which was very,

16
00:01:03,401 --> 00:01:07,810
very involved and they provided 24
seven customer service for my land rush

17
00:01:07,811 --> 00:01:12,370
campaign because it was critical for
me to take care of every person who

18
00:01:12,371 --> 00:01:13,960
purchased my books and participated.

19
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:18,610
This allowed me to focus on the things
that I am better. At my strengths,

20
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,970
like the marketing plan that
we'd worked on for six months,

21
00:01:21,971 --> 00:01:25,040
implementing that until
trains their experience.

22
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:29,020
Customer service reps to
know your business and your
products inside and out and

23
00:01:29,021 --> 00:01:30,970
make your customers are raving fans.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,110
They answer more than a million customer
service requests every year and they

25
00:01:35,111 --> 00:01:39,850
can do so across all platforms, including
email, phone, social media, texts,

26
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:40,923
even chat,

27
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:45,250
leaving your customers with poor
service or just mediocre service,

28
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:49,030
which by the way,
in a competitive pool is a huge liability.

29
00:01:49,031 --> 00:01:54,031
Long wait times are unanswered messages
carries a massive cost and risk to your

30
00:01:54,461 --> 00:01:55,150
business.

31
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:59,190
Intel removes the logistics and
headaches of this type of communication,

32
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,340
allowing you to focus on your
strengths and grow your business.

33
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,040
It can be a real competitive advantage.
And I see many,

34
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:11,041
many ecommerce companies
and tech companies thinking
of customer service as a

35
00:02:11,201 --> 00:02:14,140
good enough checkbox or an afterthought,

36
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:19,410
and it just like airbnb use design and
innovative ways to be a competitor and to

37
00:02:20,531 --> 00:02:22,930
win. You can do the same
thing with customer service.

38
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:28,000
So as a listener of this podcast,

this episode is brought to
you by helix sleep. Last year.

44
00:02:48,721 --> 00:02:51,870
I focused on dramatically improving
a few things. Surprise, surprise,

45
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,540
most notably the quality of my sleep,

46
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:59,140
which seems to affect just
about everything. This led
me to revisit, you name it,

47
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,770
my daily routine, morning
routine, exercise, diet,

48
00:03:02,771 --> 00:03:06,760
all the way to what I slept on and I
ended up getting all new beds here in

49
00:03:06,761 --> 00:03:10,180
Austin, Texas, including
mattresses from Helix sleep.

52
00:03:15,761 --> 00:03:19,870
Type in sleep preferences to the perfect

00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,310
well hello boys and girls.

68
00:04:15,311 --> 00:04:18,130
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another
episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

69
00:04:18,131 --> 00:04:21,490
it is my job to interview world class
performers, to tease out the habits,

70
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:24,820
routines, thinking frameworks,
life lessons, favorite books,

71
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:28,210
etc. That you can apply
and test for yourself.

72
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,450
This episode features someone who is very,

73
00:04:31,451 --> 00:04:34,780
very well known in the world of investing,

74
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:40,200
but studying what he says is really
a study in clearer thinking and it

75
00:04:40,271 --> 00:04:43,210
transcends investing in business
and so many different ways.

76
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:48,310
Howard s marks is Cochairman and
cofounder of Oak tree capital management,

77
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:52,630
a leading investment manager with
more than a $120 billion in assets.

78
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,770
He is the author of the new book,
mastering the market cycle, subtitle,

79
00:04:56,771 --> 00:04:59,680
getting the odds on your side and
his previous book on investing.

80
00:04:59,681 --> 00:05:04,000
The most important thing to uncommon
sense for the thoughtful investor with a

81
00:05:04,001 --> 00:05:05,560
critically acclaimed bestseller.

82
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:10,450
To give you an idea of who
reads his memos and his writing.

83
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,780
Warren Buffet has written of Howard quote.

84
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:16,090
When I see memos from Howard
marks in my mail there,

85
00:05:16,091 --> 00:05:19,510
the first thing I opened and read,
I always learned something and quote,

86
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:22,460
I'm going to keep this short
because it covers a lot of ground.

87
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:25,060
We talk about the three stages
of a bull market newsletters.

88
00:05:25,061 --> 00:05:26,920
He reads thoughts on Bitcoin and Crypto.

89
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:30,280
His thoughts on understanding market
cycles for making better decisions.

90
00:05:30,281 --> 00:05:33,880
How his firm was poised to capitalize
on the bubble in 2008 and put massive

91
00:05:33,881 --> 00:05:37,780
amounts of capital to work and
more and more and more and more.

92
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:42,670
We really cover a lot of ground and I
had a lot of fun. So without further ado,

93
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:46,110
maybe I've already said that.
Here is Howard marks.

94
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:51,170
Howard, welcome to the
show. Thank you Jim.

95
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,500
I've been looking forward to being here.

96
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:56,490
I am thrilled to be sitting here with
you because I have so many fans of your

97
00:05:56,491 --> 00:05:58,010
work and thinking in my friends

98
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,390
circles.
Well that's great to hear.

99
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:03,140
When I went out to a handful to ask
for potential topics or questions,

100
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,880
there were very,
very forthcoming.

101
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,000
But what I thought I would do
in this particular episode,

102
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:12,470
I've never done in a podcast episode
before, which is to start with a poem.

103
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,630
This is always risky,
risky business.

104
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:18,590
But this was suggested
by a friend and he said,

105
00:06:18,591 --> 00:06:23,210
I would use an ae houseman poem.
This capture is effectively the, uh,

106
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,890
I think that what he views as, as, as
the spirit of, of much of your writing

107
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,920
and you can agree or disagree.
Here we go.

108
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:35,390
Eye To my perils of cheat and
Scharmer come clad in armor by stars.

109
00:06:35,391 --> 00:06:38,120
Benign hope lies to mortals
and most believe her,

110
00:06:38,121 --> 00:06:39,920
but man's deceiver was never mine.

111
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:44,540
The thoughts of others were
light and fleeting of lovers
meeting or luck or fame.

112
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:46,520
Mine were, have trouble
in mind. We're steady.

113
00:06:46,521 --> 00:06:50,600
So I was ready when trouble came
and that is a Shropshire lad,

114
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:55,530
the name of the poem.
And I thought that, uh,

115
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,580
we could certainly talk
about that specifically,

116
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,580
but in the course of doing
research for this conversation,

117
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:06,610
I discovered that you had studied not
only finance and what you might look at as

118
00:07:07,671 --> 00:07:10,820
vocational subjects when
you were an Undergrad,

119
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:14,000
but also it seems like Japanese. And, uh,

120
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:17,630
there was this concept of Mucho that
popped up when I was doing my reading.

121
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:21,410
Would you mind describing
that time and that concept?

122
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:26,010
Well, I went to Wharton, um, at a, uh,

123
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:32,510
at a edit enlightened time when you were
required to have a non business minor

124
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:39,530
and then a semester of the literature
of a foreign country in English.

125
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:44,160
I never learned Japanese, but I
started off for some reason, which I,

126
00:07:44,161 --> 00:07:47,910
it's interesting that I
have no recollection of what
motivated me, but I decided,

127
00:07:47,911 --> 00:07:52,680
not French literature or English,
but Japanese literature.

128
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:56,190
It must've been the exoticism.
Uh,

129
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:00,120
and I liked it so much that I turned
Japanese studies into my minor and took 15

130
00:08:00,121 --> 00:08:03,810
credits at the graduate level.
And that's what turned me from a,

131
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:08,100
from an indifferent teenager
into a, into a student. Really.

132
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:12,870
Um, but the professor,
for most of those courses,

133
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:17,900
a guy named Dale Saunders was an
inspirational speaker and a Oxford don an

134
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:18,883
aesthete.

135
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:24,110
And so I took this course in a Japanese
philosophy and we came across Mucho.

136
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:32,760
Mucho literally means the turning of
the wheel of the law. In other words,

137
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:37,350
the operation of life. And, uh, the, the,

138
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,840
the essence is impermanence.

139
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:44,940
And because La Wheel does turn and,
um,

140
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,360
and also the,
the unpredictability of the future.

141
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:53,390
And these were really formative for me
and they have an unconsciously informed

142
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,630
everything I've done. Um, and uh,

143
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:02,190
I think that personally that in the
investment business and also in life,

144
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:06,090
you are better off if
you realize number one,

145
00:09:06,091 --> 00:09:11,091
that if life is always going to change
on you and there will always be new

146
00:09:12,121 --> 00:09:16,380
things coming down the pike
and you can't control it. Um,

147
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:20,610
and what we have to do is live with it.

148
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:27,320
In the course of the reading.
I've done prep for this,

149
00:09:27,321 --> 00:09:31,220
which is not only the, uh, the new
book, but also many of your letters,

150
00:09:31,221 --> 00:09:35,060
which I had already been a fan
of, but went back to revisit. Uh,

151
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:39,620
I came and grant across many people who
had tried to select favorite quotes and

152
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:40,610
one that came up a lot.

153
00:09:40,611 --> 00:09:42,830
So you could certainly correct
this if this is not accurate,

154
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:47,180
is something along the lines of you can't,
you can't predict,

155
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:51,920
you can prepare.
And that leads me to

156
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,033
2008

157
00:09:56,390 --> 00:10:00,120
and we're going to bounce
around chronologically quite
a lot I suspect. But, uh,

158
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:03,470
during the 2008 bubble,
which of course it was a time

159
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,800
in which many investors were
pulling out of the market.

160
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:12,340
Oak Tree did exactly the opposite and you
put more than a half a billion dollars

161
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:15,740
a week to work over 15 weeks.

162
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:20,480
Why did you do that? Where are
you predicting where you prepared?

163
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:25,130
What led to that type of

164
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,450
decision? Sure. Well,
you mentioned the memos.

165
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:32,540
I've been riding the Malmo
since 1990. Um, and, um,

166
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,180
I wrote one about 20 years
ago, late nineties, uh, cold.

167
00:10:38,181 --> 00:10:39,740
You can't predict.
You can prepare.

168
00:10:39,741 --> 00:10:44,741
I stole the tagline from then an ad
from Northwestern mutual life insurance.

169
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,740
Uh, but I think that's true of life. Uh,

170
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,580
now it sounds like an oxymoron because
how can you prepare if you can't predict?

171
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:56,330
But the answer is, uh, we never
know what's going to happen,

172
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:01,750
but we can consider the likely
scenarios and prepare for some of them.

173
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,260
Uh, you can't, I definition prepare
for every eventuality, but, um,

174
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:13,720
I would say that we did have a sense,
uh,

175
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:16,550
my partner Bruce Karsh and I,
uh,

176
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:21,790
had a sense in o five and six that
the world wasn't running right.

177
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,653
Um,

178
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:29,680
and the main thing that made us conclude
that was the crappy deals that were

179
00:11:31,071 --> 00:11:31,904
getting done.

180
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:36,050
And he and I would spend the day
walking into each other's office saying,

181
00:11:36,051 --> 00:11:40,610
look at this piece of crap that got
issued yesterday. There's something wrong.

182
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,860
A deal like this should not be doable.

183
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:47,480
The fact that investors are buying
this tells me that they're not being

184
00:11:47,481 --> 00:11:51,950
skeptical. They're not being demanding,
they're not applying standards.

185
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:57,160
And, um, you know, uh, buffet,
uh, has a, has a saying,

186
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:59,980
the less prudence with which
others conduct their affairs,

187
00:11:59,981 --> 00:12:02,710
the greater the prudence with which
we must conduct our own affairs.

188
00:12:02,711 --> 00:12:04,840
And it's absolutely true.
Um,

189
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:10,080
and so we knew that the
market was dangerous because
of the behavior of others.

190
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:16,930
Now you can't. So we were prepared.
We, we sold a lot of assets.

191
00:12:16,931 --> 00:12:20,740
We liquidated large funds,
we replaced them with small funds.

192
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:23,950
We became very selective in
our buying. We raised, uh,

193
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:29,080
a very large fund for investment if a
crisis bursting would come into being,

194
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,310
was this for a distressed
debt for distressed debt.

195
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:40,390
Now the interesting thing though,
so you can't prepare,

196
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:45,220
you can't predict.
The thing that caused the bubble to burst,

197
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,080
uh,
was the

198
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,770
unsubstantiated polity of mortgage back
securities. And especially subprime,

199
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:59,740
if you read the memos, you won't find a
word about it. We didn't predict that.

200
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:03,270
We didn't even know about it.
It was occurring in an an,

201
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:07,630
an extra odd corner of the securities
market. Most of us didn't know about it.

202
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:12,790
Um, but it is what, what brought
the house down and we had no idea,

203
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:17,970
but we were prepared because
we knew simply that we were
on dangerous ground and

204
00:13:19,181 --> 00:13:22,300
that required a cautious preparation.

205
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:28,480
Let me ask, and I may embarrass
myself with questions that,

206
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:33,400
uh, display my ignorance about
many topics in this interview.

207
00:13:33,401 --> 00:13:37,600
But when you raised money
for a distressed debt fund,

208
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:43,650
did you emphasize to the lps or
whoever gave you those funds that,

209
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,080
uh, you had a specific timeline
in mind for deploying those funds?

210
00:13:50,081 --> 00:13:53,200
Or did you emphasize the importance of
patients with those people and that you'd

211
00:13:53,201 --> 00:13:56,370
be looking for indicators and that
they needed to look at it as a longterm

212
00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:00,670
investment?
How did you manage the question of,

213
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,680
of when from those people?

214
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:05,820
The question of when is is one of
the hardest ones in our business?

215
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:09,000
And I always say that we may have
an idea of what's going to happen,

216
00:14:09,001 --> 00:14:10,620
but we never know when
it's going to happen.

217
00:14:10,621 --> 00:14:14,070
You can't call these things as one of
my partners says, if you name a price,

218
00:14:14,071 --> 00:14:15,570
don't name a date.
And if he named the date,

219
00:14:15,571 --> 00:14:20,380
don't name a price and then
you can't be wrong. But, uh,

220
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,860
we never did name it. Date. We
probably, I can't even remember.

221
00:14:25,861 --> 00:14:30,360
We probably had a limit. In other words,
if we hadn't deployed within x years,

222
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:33,140
then it got cancelled,
the commitments. Um,

223
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,080
but I think there was an understanding
that we thought it was coming within the

224
00:14:37,081 --> 00:14:40,500
next one to three years.
Something like that.

225
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:45,040
The, the subtitle of this new book, of
course, the title, mastering mark sites,

226
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:47,320
subtitle,
getting the odds on your side.

227
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:52,590
Why this book and in the how does one,

228
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:57,290
and this is of course something we
could, we could discuss, uh, for many,

229
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:57,770
many hours on end,

230
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:02,770
but to why this book and how does someone
in this context get the odds on their

231
00:15:03,681 --> 00:15:04,514
side.

232
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:09,410
So I started writing the memos in
1990 I wrote them for 20 years.

233
00:15:09,411 --> 00:15:13,220
I always concluded that I would write
a book and pull them together into a

234
00:15:13,221 --> 00:15:15,530
philosophy when I retired.
Uh,

235
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,640
and then I got a letter from
Warren Buffet in 2010 is saying,

236
00:15:19,641 --> 00:15:22,130
if you'll write a book,
I'll give you a blurb for the jacket.

237
00:15:22,131 --> 00:15:26,450
So that was enough to get me off my
ass and get me to do it in real time.

238
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,530
Um,

239
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:31,760
I wrote a book called the most important
thing because I found myself sitting in

240
00:15:31,761 --> 00:15:35,090
client's offices saying the most
important thing is buying cheap.

241
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:36,710
And then 10 minutes later,

242
00:15:36,711 --> 00:15:38,690
I would say the most important
thing is not losing money.

243
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:40,070
And then 10 minutes later,

244
00:15:40,071 --> 00:15:42,650
I would say that the most important
thing is contrarion behavior.

245
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:46,400
So I wrote a book called the most
important thing, which has 21 chapters.

246
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,790
And each one starts off.
The title is the most important thing is,

247
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,260
and then it's a different thing.

248
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:56,210
One of those most important things is
knowing where we stand in the cycle.

249
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:00,650
Um, and uh, as I say, I
don't believe in forecasts.

250
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,590
I always say we never
know where we're going,

251
00:16:03,591 --> 00:16:06,230
but we sure as hell ought to
know where we are. I mean,

252
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:07,820
I can't tell you what's
going to happen tomorrow,

253
00:16:07,821 --> 00:16:11,060
but I should be able to assess the
current environment and that's the kind of

254
00:16:11,061 --> 00:16:15,440
thinking, uh, that helped us
prepare for the, for the crisis. Um,

255
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:20,620
I think that the two most important
things are where we stand in the cycle and

256
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:29,170
the broad subject of risk and in fact
where we stand in the cycle is the primary

257
00:16:29,301 --> 00:16:34,160
determinant of risk. Um, so, uh,

258
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:39,370
I think that this is really an important
topic and it can really help you do

259
00:16:39,651 --> 00:16:42,920
better getting the odds on your side.

260
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,910
What that means is we don't
know what's going to happen.

261
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,550
Nobody can tell you,

262
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:54,910
but there are times when the future is
the outlook is better and there are times

263
00:16:56,961 --> 00:17:00,500
when it's worse and it's largely
determined by where we stand in the cycle.

264
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:05,240
When we are low in the cycle,
that is to say we're coming off a bust.

265
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:08,210
The economy is starting to warm up.

266
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:13,790
Investors are just barely starting
to switch from pessimism to optimism

267
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:19,820
and prices are starting to rise.
Clearly the odds are in your favor,

268
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:23,360
the outlook is better. It doesn't
mean you're going to make money,

269
00:17:23,361 --> 00:17:27,260
but the chances are good. On the other
hand, when the cycle has gone on,

270
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:31,670
the up cycle has gone on for a long time
when, uh, when, when valuations are high,

271
00:17:31,671 --> 00:17:33,590
when optimism is rampant,

272
00:17:33,591 --> 00:17:36,080
when everybody thinks that
everything's gonna get better forever.

273
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:39,920
When the economy's been moving ahead for
10 years and it looks like it's never

274
00:17:39,921 --> 00:17:40,754
going to stop,

275
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:46,750
then usually the enthusiasm has just
carried the prices to such a high level

276
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,650
that the odds are against you.

277
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:54,620
And just knowing that is as a
huge advantage in investing.

278
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:58,740
You should know that when the,
when we're low in the up cycle,

279
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:04,360
that's a time to be aggressive and put
a lot of money to work and buy more

280
00:18:04,361 --> 00:18:06,190
aggressive things.
And when we,

281
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:09,160
when the cycle has gone on for
a long time and were elevated,

282
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:13,000
that's the time to take some money off
the table and behave more cautiously.

283
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:18,180
Question about 2008, uh, or you
could pick another period, uh,

284
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:22,620
a bus cycle that you're familiar with a
weather from firsthand experience were

285
00:18:22,621 --> 00:18:24,210
from research that you've done.

286
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:29,630
You raise these funds and I want to
revisit the question of when and from

287
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:34,470
personal standpoint. Uh, and
I'll admit, admit it very freely.

288
00:18:34,471 --> 00:18:39,090
I think I've had a very fear based
mentality when it comes to public markets.

289
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:43,930
I've done reasonably well in privately
held technology startups because I've

290
00:18:43,931 --> 00:18:46,860
lived in the middle of the switchbox in
San Francisco and that's the only thing

291
00:18:46,861 --> 00:18:47,790
I paid attention to.

292
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:51,540
And it protected me and away from my
lesser behaviors because I wasn't allowed

293
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:54,810
to sell. Uh, but in the public markets,

294
00:18:54,811 --> 00:18:58,710
I've almost always held on to cash,

295
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:02,160
waiting for some cataclysmic event,

296
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:05,700
but then lost my nerve in some fashion.
Uh,

297
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:07,530
I'd be,

298
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:12,270
I'd love to hear and maybe the catching
falling knives as a way to segue into

299
00:19:12,271 --> 00:19:15,560
this. I don't know, that found that
very, very interesting to read about. Uh,

300
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:20,580
but how'd you think about sitting on a
position like that and timing of what,

301
00:19:20,581 --> 00:19:24,000
what, what determines the
go command for deploying?

302
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,260
You have really,

303
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:27,570
okay.

304
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:29,730
Touched on an extremely important topic.

305
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:31,260
Okay.

306
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:34,200
Most of us have an inherent bias.

307
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:39,680
Most of us are essentially
cautious or essentially aggressive.

308
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:44,650
Probably more people are essentially
cautious then aggressive.

309
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:50,140
So one of the most important
things is to assess ourselves,

310
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:55,270
understand our biases and
try to overcome them. Now,

311
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:58,870
the Tim Ferriss that I heard you describe,

312
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:03,900
I take that to mean that maybe you were
lucky or smart enough to turn cautious

313
00:20:05,681 --> 00:20:10,090
leading up to the bubble.
The markets fell apart.

314
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,410
You're sitting on cash,

315
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:15,700
you patted yourself on the back for
being so smart as to not get caught.

316
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,070
And you're watched what you didn't do
as you didn't turn aggressive at the

317
00:20:21,071 --> 00:20:25,560
bottom. That's right. And it's common, uh,

318
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:29,800
not to do. So. It's common to,
as you say, for people to say,

319
00:20:29,801 --> 00:20:32,830
I'm not going to jump in while
this things collapsing down.

320
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:38,040
I'm going to wait till the dust has
settled and the future is clear.

321
00:20:38,561 --> 00:20:40,600
I'm not going to try to
catch a falling knife.

322
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:46,800
But it is when the knives are falling
that the people are most terrified that

323
00:20:47,441 --> 00:20:51,460
they best bargains are available.
So if you wait until the dust settles,

324
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:55,900
the bargains are gone. And that's
what happened at the end of, of a,

325
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:58,300
you mentioned that we in distressed debt,

326
00:20:58,301 --> 00:21:03,301
we put 500 million a week to work in the
last 15 weeks following the bankruptcy

327
00:21:03,611 --> 00:21:05,670
of Lehman brothers and across the firm,
uh,

328
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:10,180
something like 650 million a week
for 15 weeks. That's $10 billion.

329
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:14,920
And, but the key is it was at a time
when essentially nobody else would.

330
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,150
You get great bargains.

331
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,350
By the time the end of
Oh eight rolled around,

332
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:25,210
the hedge funds that were getting
withdrawals had either satisfied their

333
00:21:25,211 --> 00:21:29,530
withdrawals or gated
and what is gated mean,

334
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:33,760
uh, told clients they couldn't have
their money back for awhile. Gotcha. Um,

335
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,810
and uh, so the, the selling debated,

336
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:43,060
a few people saw that, that, uh,
the great values and with this,

337
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:46,690
with the selling,
and thus the fear having reduced,

338
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:50,530
they were able to come forward, prices
started to move up, then it's too late.

339
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:53,680
Because if you're trying
to buy in a falling market,

340
00:21:53,681 --> 00:21:56,410
you can buy all you want at
successively lower prices.

341
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:00,250
But if you're trying to buy
large amounts in a rising market,

342
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,150
your own buying puts the price up.
You're your own worst enemy.

343
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:07,720
You can't get much at
low prices. So, you know,

344
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:13,080
one of the keys to successful investing
is to either be unemotional or at

345
00:22:14,621 --> 00:22:17,380
minimum act like you are. Uh, you know,

346
00:22:17,381 --> 00:22:22,381
the great investors I know are
behave in an unemotional fashion.

347
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:25,870
You know, Warren Buffet
couldn't care less. Uh,

348
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:30,580
David Tepper couldn't care less
and, and, uh, and so forth. Um,

349
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:34,270
uh, my own partner, Bruce Karsh,
very, very, very stalwart.

350
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:38,860
But part of it is that we support each
other at the bottom. It's not easy,

351
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,360
you know, and, and a,

352
00:22:40,361 --> 00:22:45,361
I say in the book that I recount some of
the things we've done right with regard

353
00:22:45,671 --> 00:22:47,590
to cycled extremes,

354
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:51,640
but I absolutely don't want to
give the impression that it's easy.

355
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:55,660
It's terrifying. Others are
terrified. That's why they're selling.

356
00:22:55,661 --> 00:22:58,570
That's why they're saying, I don't care
what the price is, just get me out.

357
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,700
That's what,
that's when you want to buy.

358
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:04,600
But the things that terrify them
into selling, we'll also terrify you.

359
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,890
You have to overcome it.

360
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:12,240
How much of that stoic resilience
or a stoic composure is a

361
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:19,730
nature versus nurture
born versus trained in,

362
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:23,380
in from what you've observed
and experienced. And, and if,

363
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:25,690
if a portion of it is trained,
how,

364
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:29,320
how would you suggest to someone
that they develop that ability?

365
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,060
I don't want to answer categorically.
I think it's a hell of a lot easier.

366
00:23:34,061 --> 00:23:36,520
If you're born then you know, to, to,

367
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,610
to teach yourself to be unemotional is to,

368
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:44,650
is to count their human nature. And
by definition, it can't be easy.

369
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:50,150
Um,
this is other than as to,

370
00:23:50,151 --> 00:23:50,890
you know,
uh,

371
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:53,690
where are we in the cycle and what's
going to happen in the SEC coming six

372
00:23:53,691 --> 00:23:56,990
months? This is probably the
question I get the most often. Hmm.

373
00:23:57,170 --> 00:24:01,100
How can you teach herself to be
unemotional, to be contrarian,

374
00:24:01,101 --> 00:24:05,780
to be a second level thinker?
Um, and there is no easy answer,

375
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,950
uh, in, in the first book on the subject
of what I call second level thinking.

376
00:24:09,951 --> 00:24:14,030
I say, uh, in basketball they
say you can't coach height.

377
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:17,330
All the coaching in the world will
not yet make your team taller.

378
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:20,690
So I don't know, frankly, whether you can,

379
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:23,180
whether people can teach
themselves to be unemotional,

380
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,820
but clearly if you are

381
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:30,050
as emotional as others,

382
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:33,920
you will probably succumb
to the same errors.

383
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:39,920
So let's, I think we can not, I'd
love to back into this type of, uh,

384
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:44,820
not psychological profiling,
but an examination of,

385
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:48,300
of this type of resilience.
Maybe indirectly. Maybe it'll
come up, maybe it won't,

386
00:24:48,301 --> 00:24:52,680
but, and I might get
the total duration, uh,

387
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:55,740
incorrect. But you mentioned the
name Bruce Karsh that I'd love to,

388
00:24:56,550 --> 00:25:00,720
to bring up yet again. And he made me make
him up repeatedly. 23 year partnership,

389
00:25:00,721 --> 00:25:05,260
is that right? Or 20 plus year. 31 and
31. Okay. Oaktree is 23 years. I got,

390
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:08,950
we worked together for eight years
before the prior to that. All right, so

391
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:15,070
if you were trying to hire a say
25 year old version of Bruce,

392
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,080
what would you be looking for?

393
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:21,490
Well, I'll tell you what he
is, let's, let's do that. He's

394
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,090
super smart. That goes
without saying. He is

395
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:35,230
highly competitive. Uh, you know,
he, he's a chess player and, and,

396
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:39,090
and most of the people that are, again,
that I know who are good investors are,

397
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,340
are, are a games players,
either backgammon or, or,

398
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:46,460
or chess or something like that.
Um,

399
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:51,200
we are an inherently competitive, um, uh,

400
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:56,360
he's also a very analytical
and he's kind of a grinder.

401
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:01,480
And I would describe myself
as being intuitive and,

402
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,360
and a quick decider thinking
slow and fast. Conaman um,

403
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,990
I'm a fast thinker.
You tell me a problem.

404
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:14,050
I tell you my answer in short order
and I'm done with it for the most part,

405
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:17,510
Bruce,
we'll think about it longer,

406
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:22,680
come to his conclusion and then it'll
come back the next day. And he said,

407
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:23,900
you know,
I was thinking about it last night.

408
00:26:23,901 --> 00:26:25,790
I don't think that's right and here's why.

409
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:28,700
Or I don't think you were right
and here's why. And he'll,

410
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,550
he'll grind on it for hours and days.

411
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,020
I think this is part of the
secret to our success. Uh,

412
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:42,410
again, something I once wrote a on the
subject of a good partnership, I should,

413
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:45,690
I said shared values and
compliment the re skills.

414
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,940
If you have a partner who has
different values than you do,

415
00:26:50,941 --> 00:26:52,370
for example,
uh,

416
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:57,620
w Bob wants to make the most money
possible and Ed wants to operate with

417
00:26:59,581 --> 00:27:04,080
integrity.
Those are largely contradictory.

418
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:08,120
So I think it's very important to
share values, but I also think it's,

419
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:12,900
it's important to not be the same
person, a copy of yourself. If you're,

420
00:27:12,901 --> 00:27:15,200
if it's a copy of yourself,
you don't need it, it,

421
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:19,770
it the person should bring skills that
you don't bring and maybe operate in ways

422
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:21,420
you don't.
And I think it's,

423
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:25,230
it's probably helpful that I'm
intuitive and he's analytical.

424
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:31,000
I've heard, well heard, that's not the
right not the right verb. I've read, uh,

425
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:35,910
I believe is Buffett who said
that Charlie Munger has the,

426
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:39,450
something along the lines of the
best 62nd mind he's ever encountered.

427
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:45,260
It sounds like you also have a very
highly developed fast thinking capacity.

428
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:55,400
Is how is it similar or different
from Charlie mungers 62nd?

429
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,460
Well, it, if, first of all,
it's a daunting comparison.

430
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:03,080
I would never put myself in the
category with Charlie. He's, he's,

431
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:07,560
he's brilliant than, and a one of
the best thinkers there is. But, uh,

432
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:10,080
you know, uh, I mean,

433
00:28:10,081 --> 00:28:14,490
the main thing is that he has
read more broadly. He's had,

434
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,290
he's had another 22 years to read further.
And knee was probably always,

435
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:24,510
uh, a broader reader
than I was. And so it's,

436
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:28,620
it's his ability to call on
these references, you know, uh,

437
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:34,220
in a way it's kind of silly to think we
have to end or that we can reinvent all

438
00:28:34,501 --> 00:28:38,240
the wisdom in the world. It's great
to borrow from others and, and,

439
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:42,090
and Charlie does that broadly and
I try to do it. He just knows more.

440
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,670
I think we'll,
we'll

441
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:48,670
almost certainly come back to a more an
in Charlie Moore in this conversation,

442
00:28:48,981 --> 00:28:53,870
but I want to return to to Bruce because
you mentioned the complimentary skill

443
00:28:53,871 --> 00:28:56,210
sets and you've,
you've written about him of course,

444
00:28:56,211 --> 00:28:58,910
quite a bit and mentioned him
quite a bit and I want to pull up

445
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,750
quickly just a few lines.
In the new book,

446
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:06,260
it's Bruce and I have exchanged ideas and
backed each other up almost daily over

447
00:29:06,261 --> 00:29:10,100
that period. This is a proceeding
taxed and my give and take with him,

448
00:29:10,101 --> 00:29:13,280
especially in the most difficult of times
has played particularly indispensable

449
00:29:13,281 --> 00:29:16,250
part and the development of the approaches
to cycles on which this book spaced.

450
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:20,000
Could you share an example of a,

451
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:26,710
of back and forth or disagreement during
a difficult time or with a particular

452
00:29:27,081 --> 00:29:30,620
decision? Uh, does that possible
just so that we can we have a,

453
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:33,260
a real world example of,
of the interplay between the two of you?

454
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:34,420
We,

455
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:39,420
we normally don't debate
individual investments because
he operates more at that

456
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:43,570
level. And I operate more at the
big picture level within oak tree.

457
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:48,400
But I mean, I think a good
example is in the period we just,

458
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:50,380
we've been talking about
a couple of times now,

459
00:29:50,381 --> 00:29:54,280
we've mentioned the last 15
weeks of Oh eight. Um, you know,

460
00:29:54,281 --> 00:29:59,281
it was really a very tough period because
a Lehman brothers had gone bankrupt

461
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:01,480
and, uh, and uh,

462
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:04,840
bear Stearns had disappeared and Merrill
Lynch had been absorbed by Bank of

463
00:30:04,841 --> 00:30:09,830
America and Washington mutual and
Wacovia Bank. And, uh, you know, and it,

464
00:30:09,831 --> 00:30:12,550
it looked like falling dominoes and it,
you know,

465
00:30:12,551 --> 00:30:15,610
people were talking about the fact that
Morgan Stanley was next and Goldman was

466
00:30:15,611 --> 00:30:16,450
right behind that.

467
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:20,920
And so you just had to
conclude that the world,

468
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:23,920
that the financial world was
either going to end or it wasn't,

469
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:28,660
you couldn't analyze it. You could improve
anything about the future. And, and, and,

470
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,880
and so it required a,

471
00:30:30,881 --> 00:30:34,330
an almost gamesman like approach
to whether you buy or not.

472
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:39,820
And, uh, you know, we would
talk about that in that sense.

473
00:30:39,821 --> 00:30:43,420
And we were both very comfortable
talking about it in that sense.

474
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,720
And what we concluded was that

475
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:51,880
if the world ended,
it didn't matter what we did,

476
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:57,190
but if the world didn't end and we
hadn't bought, we hadn't done our job.

477
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:01,120
So buck up and do your job.

478
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:06,550
Now, the great thing is that half
the days Bruce would come to me,

479
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:09,610
cause he would be lying in bed at night
thinking about this stuff and he would

480
00:31:09,611 --> 00:31:13,690
come to me and he would say, you know
what? I think we're going too fast.

481
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:17,560
I think we should slow down.
And half the days he would say,

482
00:31:17,561 --> 00:31:20,650
I think we're going too
slow. And, uh, you know,

483
00:31:20,651 --> 00:31:25,090
so I would play devil's
advocate, um, and uh,

484
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:29,830
and support his decision. But, but
try to show him the other side.

485
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:34,660
And he would do that with me. And
that's why we got it done. But I,

486
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:39,430
as I say in the, in the introduction
to the book, from what you read,

487
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:44,710
I think that I don't think either of
us could have done as good a job alone.

488
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:48,340
I think that the devil's advocacy and,

489
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:53,050
but in a supportive way,
uh, really held the key. Um,

490
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:57,400
I wrote in one of my memos,
I wrote about a reporter,

491
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,990
uh,
and he,

492
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:03,970
he called me up a few days after the
bankruptcy of Lehman and he said,

493
00:32:03,971 --> 00:32:08,620
what are you doing? I said, we're
buying. He said, you are like,

494
00:32:08,621 --> 00:32:11,950
it was the craziest thing he ever
heard. And you know, my reaction was,

495
00:32:11,951 --> 00:32:16,090
if we're not buying now and we
will, um, but, uh, you know,

496
00:32:16,091 --> 00:32:20,200
it's been a great partnership.
As you say, 31 years.

497
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:24,640
Never an argument. Never an
argue, never an argument.

498
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:29,620
I mean intellectual disagreements,
but never an emotional argument and never,

499
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:33,870
and the key
is respect.

500
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,510
Even when we disagree.
We respect.

501
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:42,440
And the great thing about that
is you sit down, you disagree.

502
00:32:42,441 --> 00:32:42,710
You,

503
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:46,970
maybe you don't come to the enclosure
and then you go back to your corners and

504
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:50,930
he says, well, you know what,
maybe how it's right. And I say,

505
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:55,310
maybe Bruce is right and then you can
have a productive discussion. If, if you,

506
00:32:55,311 --> 00:32:57,530
if your reaction is that moron,

507
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:02,030
then you can't benefit
from what he has to say

508
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:03,791
for,

509
00:33:03,791 --> 00:33:08,791
for people who were hoping to exhibit
that type of poise and respect for someone

510
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:12,580
else, are there any tactical
recommendations you might have?

511
00:33:12,581 --> 00:33:16,360
And the reason I asked that is, uh,
I no longer live in silicon valley,

512
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:19,810
but I was there for 17 years and you
see cofounder splits all the time.

513
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:25,210
Some of them go the distance,
but a lot of them end up fatalities.

514
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:29,050
And you can almost see the writing on the
wall when they're specked goes out the

515
00:33:29,051 --> 00:33:33,320
window. And it's just a matter of
time for a lot of these guys, uh, for,

516
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:36,850
for people who are in partnership,
let's just for the time being,

517
00:33:36,851 --> 00:33:39,790
assume it's in a business
capacity or an investing capacity,

518
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,050
what are some of the tools of the
trades that it doesn't escalate?

519
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:46,510
Do you walk out of the room if
you're starting to get heated there?

520
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:51,960
Or do you avoid in some systems
way given policies of the firm?

521
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:58,470
Any types of sort of mission critical
single decisions from becoming an object

522
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:05,290
of argument, if that makes any sense.
Because when the stakes are high,

523
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:09,160
what are some, some recommendations
you would have when things,

524
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:11,380
when perhaps emotions
are starting to escalate?

525
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:14,480
Well, the only issue I would
take, Tim, is you started with,

526
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:19,820
assume you're in partnership. I
think you have to start sooner. Okay.

527
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:24,050
Who Do you get in partnership with?
And you know,

528
00:34:24,051 --> 00:34:24,980
you have to,

529
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:29,240
you have to share values and you shouldn't
be partners with somebody you're not

530
00:34:29,241 --> 00:34:34,241
going to like enjoy spending time with
and be able to work with constructively

531
00:34:34,551 --> 00:34:37,580
when the stuff hits the fan.
That's really the case. So, I mean,

532
00:34:37,581 --> 00:34:42,581
I believe that that most solving
most personnel or managerial,

533
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:43,983
uh,

534
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:49,420
problems start at the beginning with
the hiring decision or the combination

535
00:34:49,731 --> 00:34:52,340
decisions. So, so, uh, you know,

536
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:54,740
just don't get into business with somebody
you're not going to be able to live

537
00:34:54,741 --> 00:34:56,520
with. It's kind of like a marriage. Uh,

538
00:34:56,850 --> 00:35:01,850
do you stress test their ability to
handle potential high stress situations in

539
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:05,430
some real or simulated fashion?

540
00:35:05,431 --> 00:35:10,020
Do you look back at in say,
hiring decision?

541
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:12,810
Do you look back at their history
and reference checks to assess that?

542
00:35:12,811 --> 00:35:15,750
How do you assess whether someone
is going to keep their cool or not?

543
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:19,560
Well, we don't do simulations or war
games or anything like that, but we do,

544
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:24,270
you know, I mean, that's an important part
of reference checking. Uh, you have to,

545
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:28,950
you have to look beyond whether the
person is smart and whether the person's a

546
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:31,670
moneymaker, you know, uh, uh,

547
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:37,170
we have a no assholes rule at oak tree
and I think that saves solves a of

548
00:35:37,171 --> 00:35:39,000
problems. Then, you know,

549
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:43,080
there are lots of people in the world
who can make you a lot of money, but you,

550
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,750
you may not want to be in
business with them and it,

551
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,940
it may not be viable long term.
Now it's,

552
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,460
it's hard to absolutely follow that rule,
uh,

553
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:56,940
because really smart moneymakers
are very tempting. But I think it's,

554
00:35:56,970 --> 00:36:01,380
I think it's really important,
but, but then, you know, once,

555
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:06,800
once you are in business together and
you have the inevitable disagreement,

556
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:12,000
I think one of the most important
things is to, number one,

557
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:15,750
acknowledge the limits on
what, you know, if you,

558
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,870
if you go in with some humility,

559
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,920
then you're unlikely to have a fight to
the death that is to the death of your

560
00:36:25,081 --> 00:36:29,340
partnership over an issue.
And, and it's, it's, you know,

561
00:36:29,341 --> 00:36:31,260
it's great to say,
I mean,

562
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:34,500
people should wake up in the morning
and start the day by practicing.

563
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:39,030
I don't know. I don't know.
It's a great thing to say.

564
00:36:39,031 --> 00:36:43,950
And not enough people say it. And,
and the, the, the, the flip side of,

565
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:48,650
I don't know, is what I said
before about our discussions. The,

566
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:51,540
maybe he's right.
You know,

567
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:56,250
and so I think that's
important. Humility. Number two,

568
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:58,740
again,
a control of emotion.

569
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,670
Don't get into fight just to
show who's who's more manly, uh,

570
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:07,440
or you know, or, or equate, uh,

571
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:11,820
winning the argument with success.
Because if you're,

572
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:15,480
if you're in a business situation and
you're fighting for something that

573
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:17,580
ultimately proves out to be a mistake,

574
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:23,420
your success in winning the
argument will lead to a failure.

575
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:29,460
Um, so don't confuse winning the argument
with coming to the best decision. Um,

576
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:33,900
and you know, again, try
to limit the testosterone.

577
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,110
Um,
I think that really gets in the way.

578
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:38,730
One,
uh,

579
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:43,730
one of the many things that I really
enjoy about your writing is that it serves

580
00:37:45,061 --> 00:37:50,061
for me at least as a reflection on clear
thinking that transcends investing.

581
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:55,500
It'll, it applies to so many
if not all areas of life,

582
00:37:55,501 --> 00:37:59,160
at least those governed by
anything in the prefrontal cortex.

583
00:37:59,161 --> 00:38:01,080
And one that caught my eye when I was,

584
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:05,460
when I was reading just page 15
in the new book is the following.

585
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:08,640
And, uh, I'd just like to
read, it's not very long.

586
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:12,240
In addition to an opinion
regarding what's going to happen,

587
00:38:12,241 --> 00:38:14,940
people should have a view on the
likelihood that their opinion will prove

588
00:38:14,941 --> 00:38:18,420
correct. Some events can be predicted
with substantial confidence. Example,

589
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:21,540
given we'll a given investment grade bond,
pay the interest in promises.

590
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,120
Some are uncertain example,

591
00:38:24,121 --> 00:38:28,080
will Amazon still be the leader in online
retailing and 10 years and some are

592
00:38:28,081 --> 00:38:32,280
entirely unpredictable example. Will the
stock market go up or down next month?

593
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:37,090
It's my point here that not
all predictions be treated
as equally likely to be

594
00:38:37,091 --> 00:38:39,550
correct in us.
They shouldn't be relied on equally.

595
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:42,190
I don't think most people are as
aware of this as they should be.

596
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:46,240
Could you expand on this a bit,
if that's possible,

597
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:51,480
maybe give some examples of how you or
other people you respect use that type

598
00:38:52,031 --> 00:38:52,480
of,

599
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:57,480
of puristic when making decisions or just
I suppose reflecting reality in their

600
00:38:58,511 --> 00:39:01,510
own minds are perceiving
things. Sure. You know,

601
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:03,260
okay,

602
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:08,260
we all have opinions and we hold our
opinions because we believe in them.

603
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:10,610
Nobody ever says,
you know,

604
00:39:10,611 --> 00:39:15,080
my opinion is x and I think I'm wrong.

605
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:20,600
We all think that our
opinions are correct. Uh, but,

606
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,850
and, and, and again, the
world becomes a better place,

607
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:30,970
an easier place to navigate if we admit
that even though there are opinions that

608
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:35,080
they may be wrong. Uh,
and, uh, you know, how,

609
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:39,290
how does an investor like me deal with
the fact that he doesn't believe in

610
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:44,690
future predictions and, and,
uh, and the answer is a,

611
00:39:44,691 --> 00:39:47,660
I say,
and I have opinions on all these subjects,

612
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:51,080
but I say it's one thing to
have an opinion and there's it,

613
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:53,540
it's another to believe
and act as if it's right.

614
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:58,340
And if you just say,
maybe I'm wrong.

615
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:03,110
If the world gets easier, in my opinion,
uh, easier to succeed, uh, less,

616
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,980
less easy to, to, to navigate
day to day. You know, and,

617
00:40:06,981 --> 00:40:11,930
and a big theme of the book is
that we have to view the future,

618
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:17,230
not as an event which is
predetermined and predictable or,

619
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:23,180
you know, determined already,
but as a range of possibilities,

620
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:25,700
as a probability distribution.
And you know,

621
00:40:25,701 --> 00:40:30,701
I went to the world's fair in
flushing in 1964 I think it was.

622
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:36,480
And I stood before an exhibit
that IBM had and it was, you know,

623
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:39,140
typical of technology 50 odd years ago.

624
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,930
It was the most simplistic thing
you could imagine. They had,

625
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:45,980
they had a slot at the top and a bunch
of balls and the balls came through the

626
00:40:45,981 --> 00:40:48,860
slot. And then there were
a bunch of pegs in a grid.

627
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:54,230
And when the ball's hit the pegs,
they started to diffuse.

628
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:56,930
And by the time they get to the bottom,

629
00:40:57,590 --> 00:41:00,200
they were in a bell shaped distribution.

630
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:05,390
And I think that was probably my
first exposure to a distribution.

631
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:08,840
But it's beautiful and that's how life is.

632
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:12,410
The future is a distribution
of possibilities.

633
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:18,170
And if we're really smart,
we know what the distribution,

634
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:19,880
what the possibilities are,

635
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:23,390
and we may have an idea of which
are more likely and less likely,

636
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:26,450
but we still don't know what's
going to happen. And, and,

637
00:41:26,451 --> 00:41:30,320
and I think we have to behave that
way now. Some things we know more,

638
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:33,820
some things we know less, we
shouldn't get confused. But the,

639
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:38,900
the most important single thing is to
not have the same degree of conviction

640
00:41:39,411 --> 00:41:40,760
about all of our opinions.

641
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,690
Do you apply a biopsy of
one to 10 numerical value?

642
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:48,630
Is it more of a light,
medium strong had?

643
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:50,390
How do you think about that yourself?

644
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:53,630
Yeah, well I think it's
certainly not, you know,

645
00:41:53,631 --> 00:41:58,190
I'm not for the most part a
quantifier if you read the book,

646
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:02,280
uh, I would hope you would be struck
by how few numbers there are in it.

647
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:06,980
Um, and uh, you know,

648
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:12,040
one of the great quotes which has
broadly attributed to Einstein,

649
00:42:12,381 --> 00:42:13,580
I don't think it was Einstein,

650
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:18,080
is that not everything that can be counted
counts and not everything that counts

651
00:42:18,081 --> 00:42:18,914
can be counted.

652
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:24,340
So the most important insights
to life or non quantitative.

653
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:25,611
Um,
but I,

654
00:42:25,611 --> 00:42:30,611
I try to be conscious of when I have
an opinion of how likely it is to be

655
00:42:32,811 --> 00:42:37,190
correct and I try really hard not to
always assume that I'm right. By the way,

656
00:42:37,191 --> 00:42:41,030
let me add one thing. Um, Henry Kaufman,

657
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:45,510
who was the chief economist of
Solomon Brothers in the 70s, uh,

658
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:50,520
at a time when America was
riven with hyperinflations 15,

659
00:42:51,021 --> 00:42:55,520
16, 17% a year, nobody could figure
out how to stop it. And, and,

660
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:59,120
and the world was really a very
difficult place to live at. Kauffman.

661
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:02,270
There was two guys, Kaufman and
now, well, and our first Boston,

662
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:06,050
they were called Doctor Gloom.
And Doctor Doom and, and, but,

663
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:10,580
but Kaufman said two kinds of
people lose a lot of money.

664
00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:16,020
The people who know nothing and the
people who know everything and um,

665
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:21,020
uh, it's very few of us know nothing,
but it's really important to assume,

666
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:22,550
to not assume we know everything.

667
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:29,190
Is there any reading you've done or maybe
it's just real life experience in the

668
00:43:30,131 --> 00:43:32,020
trenches of doing this
day in, day out. But, uh,

669
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:36,570
if for people who want
to develop that, uh, I,

670
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:37,570
I saw that you're,

671
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:42,430
it seems like a reader or a fan of some
of what Nassim Taleb has put out and he

672
00:43:42,431 --> 00:43:44,530
talks about epistemological
arrogance quite a bit.

673
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:48,180
It's a thinking that we are believing.
We know it all or more than we,

674
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:53,080
we actually know. How would you suggest,
are there any resources, letters, books,

675
00:43:53,081 --> 00:43:53,890
memos,

676
00:43:53,890 --> 00:43:58,890
talks that you might recommend to
people who want to really cultivate that

677
00:43:59,621 --> 00:44:02,320
awareness of limited knowledge?

678
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:07,530
Well, when you started to ask that
question, I did fast forward to, uh,

679
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:12,770
uh, Nassim Nicholas to lab and
his book fooled by randomness.

680
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:13,521
Uh,

681
00:44:13,521 --> 00:44:18,521
I think it's a really important
book in terms of its ideas and,

682
00:44:18,831 --> 00:44:20,340
uh, it's, uh,

683
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:25,420
it's really about how much
randomness there is in our world.

684
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:27,980
Now. It's primarily about
investing, not the general world,

685
00:44:27,981 --> 00:44:30,120
but the world of investing.
And you know,

686
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:33,300
his example that if you're a dentist,

687
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:35,970
he picks on the dentist a lot in the book,
but it,

688
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:38,450
but if you're a dentist on economist,
yes.

689
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:43,970
And you always fill a tooth the same way
you'll always get a successful filling.

690
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:46,770
Whereas in the investment business,

691
00:44:46,771 --> 00:44:50,490
there's nothing that you can do that
if you do it the same every time,

692
00:44:50,491 --> 00:44:54,810
you're going to get a successful
outcome because of the changeability and

693
00:44:54,811 --> 00:44:59,580
randomness in the world.
Um, and, and, uh, this is,

694
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:04,050
uh, extremely important and, uh, you know,

695
00:45:04,051 --> 00:45:08,760
we have to think about the world as
a probability distribution when we,

696
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,180
you know, one of the things that interest
me most is when you look at history,

697
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:16,530
you say, well, I don't know so much
about the future, but the history that's,

698
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:19,980
that's done, that's settled. We know what
happened, we know what the truth was.

699
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:24,990
But to lab uses a concept
called alternative histories.

700
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:29,460
The other things that reasonably
probably could've happened but didn't.

701
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:34,920
And so when you look at a
historical event, you have to say,

702
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:41,550
was it,
was that outcome inevitable,

703
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:47,780
in which case that demonstrates a a
truth or was it subject to randomness and

704
00:45:49,891 --> 00:45:54,660
could other things have happened just as
well? You know, I wrote a memo, uh, in,

705
00:45:54,661 --> 00:45:56,310
in a memo around Oh six,

706
00:45:56,311 --> 00:46:01,311
I talked about the rose bowl game between
USC and University of Texas and USC

707
00:46:02,491 --> 00:46:07,110
was highly touted as the best team in
the history of foot college football.

708
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:10,410
And,
and I won't go through all of it,

709
00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:12,840
but I hope readers will take a look at it.

710
00:46:12,841 --> 00:46:15,960
But in the end they lost on one play.

711
00:46:16,890 --> 00:46:20,760
And so nobody talked about them as
being the best football team in history.

712
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:24,720
My point was, and I wrote, I
entitled this section, What's real?

713
00:46:26,070 --> 00:46:30,300
Maybe they were the best team in history
and maybe the fact that they didn't,

714
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:33,690
weren't successful on that one play
that the whole game then maybe it was

715
00:46:33,691 --> 00:46:37,080
because the wind was blowing left to
right rather than right to left at that

716
00:46:37,081 --> 00:46:37,914
moment.

717
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:43,100
And so we should not be too
firm in our conclusions.

718
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:49,110
I guess the recurrent theme is that is,
is a lack of certainty,

719
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:53,940
but I really would push people
to fooled by randomness. Uh,

720
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:56,880
there's a little book by John Kenneth
Galbraith called the short history of

721
00:46:56,881 --> 00:47:01,050
financial euphoria and a great quote, he
said, we have two kinds of forecasters,

722
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:05,190
the ones who don't know, and the ones
who don't know, they don't know. And,

723
00:47:05,191 --> 00:47:10,080
and that has been very, uh,
inspirational for me. I was, uh,

724
00:47:10,510 --> 00:47:14,400
I don't think this was
attributed to you, but, uh,

725
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:19,310
I came across it in looking at
some highlights of your memos, uh,

726
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,510
in prep for this conversation.

727
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:26,040
And I don't think it's attributed to you,
but someone said,

728
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:29,530
dumb money can become smart money
if it accepts its limitations.

729
00:47:29,770 --> 00:47:31,940
I don't know if he would agree
with that, but it, it, it's,

730
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:36,070
it stuck with me is maybe
not necessarily forecasters,

731
00:47:36,071 --> 00:47:40,660
but at least people who cultivate
becoming aware of what they don't know.

732
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,850
Sure. Well, I think first of all,

733
00:47:42,851 --> 00:47:47,380
knowing what you don't know is one
of the keys to success in anything.

734
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:51,000
You know, dirty Harry said a man
should know his limitations. Uh,

735
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:54,700
I wouldn't say, Eh, it's not my quote.

736
00:47:54,730 --> 00:47:58,950
I wouldn't necessarily say the dumb
money can be smart money. Uh, but, but I,

737
00:47:58,951 --> 00:48:03,951
I would say that one of the ways to avoid
being dumb money is to not act as if

738
00:48:05,171 --> 00:48:07,390
you know things you don't know.
Uh,

739
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:10,870
maybe by the time I get done
giving the quote, I'll be,

740
00:48:10,871 --> 00:48:12,760
are ever able to remember who said it,

741
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:17,020
but somebody very wise said Mark Twain.
That's it.

742
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:20,680
It's not what you don't know
that gets you into trouble.

743
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:25,270
It's what you know for certain that
just ain't true. That is so important.

744
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:30,600
There's nothing more dangerous
in life than being sure you know,

745
00:48:30,671 --> 00:48:35,470
something that you don't know if you are,
if you have excess certitude,

746
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:41,490
you will do things boldly in dangerous
ways and to dangerous extents that have

747
00:48:41,651 --> 00:48:44,410
the ability to get you into trouble,
get you killed.

748
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,580
But a sentence that starts
you off with I'm not sure,

749
00:48:48,581 --> 00:48:52,750
but is unlikely to lead to fatal action.

750
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:58,080
The distinction to me is so
clear and so unarguable that I,

751
00:48:58,161 --> 00:49:02,260
I think this is one of the most important
things for life. Know your limitations.

752
00:49:02,890 --> 00:49:07,890
You mentioned a little bit earlier how
you could potentially say to yourself in

753
00:49:08,021 --> 00:49:12,010
the morning, I don't know. I don't
know. Maybe he or she is right.

754
00:49:12,011 --> 00:49:13,960
Maybe he or she is. Right. Uh,

755
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:18,860
and it makes me think of some of these
Memento Mori type quotes that, uh,

756
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:23,740
maybe maybe apocryphal from ancient Rome
or they'd have someone behind or the

757
00:49:23,741 --> 00:49:26,430
emperor when he's being paraded through
the streets and you're just a man.

758
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:31,120
You're just a man. Something like that.
I know this is, this is seemingly,

759
00:49:31,121 --> 00:49:35,290
maybe not on the same topic, but
nonetheless, I, I want to ask about it.

760
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:41,580
Do you have any particular routines or
habits in the first say hour or two of

761
00:49:41,891 --> 00:49:46,720
your day, whether it's now or
whether you are kind of, if you can,

762
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:51,730
if there were a particularly productive
period in your professional life where

763
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:55,450
you feel like those routines or
habits in the morning were important?

764
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:56,800
Does anything come to mind?

765
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:02,380
I don't have a stylized routines.
I mean,

766
00:50:02,381 --> 00:50:04,030
I would just say that my life is,
uh,

767
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:08,350
is pretty calm and I try to
keep it that way. Uh, and um,

768
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:12,280
what would be a symptom of it not being
common? How would you respond to that?

769
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:13,743
Well,

770
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:18,900
watching too much political TV and
getting exercised about what you see on TV

771
00:50:20,231 --> 00:50:23,830
would be a good example. I mean,
uh, that's, that's negative energy.

772
00:50:23,831 --> 00:50:27,950
That's not going to contribute to
your effectiveness in the day. Now my,

773
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:33,040
the fact that I don't get exercised
about what I see on the news shows, uh,

774
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:35,420
is not purposeful.

775
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:36,571
So up to this point,

776
00:50:36,571 --> 00:50:40,290
we've talked a fair amount about
the importance of avoiding Hubris,

777
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:44,100
of understanding your limitations,
the incompleteness of your knowledge.

778
00:50:44,430 --> 00:50:49,430
How do you balance that with perhaps
knowing your strengths well enough or

779
00:50:49,711 --> 00:50:54,510
having conviction in evidence to the
extent that you can then take action?

780
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:55,560
Sure.

781
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:56,760
That's a great question,
Tim.

782
00:50:57,570 --> 00:51:02,040
And clearly it's essential to balance.
Uh,

783
00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:05,070
you don't want to be the person
who thinks he knows everything,

784
00:51:05,071 --> 00:51:08,970
but you can't be very successful in
life and especially not in investing.

785
00:51:08,971 --> 00:51:13,860
If you think you're the person who knows
nothing, uh, there is no magic in it.

786
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:18,780
Uh, there is no rule, no method. Uh,

787
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:22,950
it's just the, uh, an
awareness. Um, but we,

788
00:51:22,951 --> 00:51:27,900
we have to feel, we know
enough to take action. Now,

789
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:32,730
most successful people,
most smart people,

790
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:37,890
uh, have, uh, don't have
a problem in that area.

791
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:42,720
They have a history of having their
ideas validated for the most part.

792
00:51:43,170 --> 00:51:45,600
Um, but I think it's, it's, it's,

793
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:50,780
I mean it is one of the great
conundrums which is unanswerable.

794
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:56,160
Uh, methodologically, you
know, you buy a stock at 80,
it falls to 60. You say, well,

795
00:51:56,161 --> 00:51:58,770
I think it's cheaper now. I like
it more. I'm going to buy more.

796
00:51:58,771 --> 00:52:03,090
You buy more now as well as the 40. Is
there a point at which you say, well,

797
00:52:03,091 --> 00:52:08,010
maybe I'm wrong and maybe the
market's right. Uh, you know,

798
00:52:08,011 --> 00:52:11,820
if you, if you throw in the towel
and sell every stock you buy,

799
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:15,210
when it goes down a little, you
can, you can never be successful.

800
00:52:15,330 --> 00:52:19,650
But if you ignore the
possibility that you're wrong,

801
00:52:20,310 --> 00:52:24,890
you can ever be successful. Um, and you,
you have to strike a balance. So, uh,

802
00:52:25,470 --> 00:52:28,200
when you buy a stock and
it goes down a little,

803
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:32,550
you take another look at your analysis.
Is there anything you missed?

804
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,550
Did your analysis hold water and,
and so forth.

805
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:40,290
Maybe you talk to some people that you
respect, uh, to get their opinions.

806
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:43,770
Um, but, uh, you know, again, if you're,

807
00:52:43,771 --> 00:52:47,760
if you're too sure you're in trouble and
if you're too unsure, you're in trouble.

808
00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:49,770
Uh,
you have to strike a balance.

809
00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:53,850
If we come back to the,
the hypothetical example,

810
00:52:53,851 --> 00:52:58,851
you gave someone buying at 60 drops to
40 drop to 30 drops to 20 to avoid being

811
00:53:00,061 --> 00:53:05,061
in that position where you are offering
yourself the option of buying or selling

812
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:09,150
at each of those check in points.

813
00:53:09,390 --> 00:53:14,390
What are you deciding in advance so that
you don't make those interim mistakes

814
00:53:14,761 --> 00:53:18,000
or you don't even make those decisions or,
or look at them to begin with.

815
00:53:18,790 --> 00:53:22,420
That's not my approach or oak trees
approach. We don't have preset rules.

816
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:24,310
Everybody says,
well,

817
00:53:24,311 --> 00:53:27,600
why didn't you just a rule that there
are things called stop loss orders.

818
00:53:27,601 --> 00:53:30,180
You buy something goes down 20%.
You sell it every time.

819
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:35,440
There is no rule that will
ever work in every case. Uh,

820
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:38,790
you have a say. You have a rule
that goes down 20 year out,

821
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:43,350
so it goes down 21 Esl,

822
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:46,950
then it goes up a hundred,
you know, or it goes down 10,

823
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:51,150
you don't sell and it never
goes up again. Uh, there,

824
00:53:51,151 --> 00:53:54,810
there can't be a rule that
always works when they,

825
00:53:55,110 --> 00:53:58,100
just before the publication
of my other book, uh,

826
00:53:58,220 --> 00:53:59,960
I had lunch with Charlie Munger and,

827
00:54:00,010 --> 00:54:03,930
and at the end of the lunch and when I
got up to go, he said, now, just remember,

828
00:54:04,530 --> 00:54:08,490
none of this is meant to be easy.
Anybody who thinks it's easy, as stupid,

829
00:54:09,090 --> 00:54:13,920
these things cannot be reduced to a rule.
The market

830
00:54:15,990 --> 00:54:20,100
operates,
so as to confound rule makers.

831
00:54:20,610 --> 00:54:22,410
Uh, you know, it, it,

832
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:26,910
and I wrote a memo five years ago called,
it's not easy.

833
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:30,900
It all comes down to judgment.
We have to have,

834
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:33,570
if we're going to have superior
investment performance,

835
00:54:33,571 --> 00:54:38,130
we have to have superior
judgement. And, uh, you, you,

836
00:54:38,610 --> 00:54:43,020
I mean, you can work on your processes
both intellectual and emotional,

837
00:54:43,290 --> 00:54:47,370
but you can't, I mean,
superior judgement is,

838
00:54:47,371 --> 00:54:52,350
isn't something you can order up and
not everybody can necessarily attain it.

839
00:54:52,710 --> 00:54:55,800
Um, but, uh, I mean,

840
00:54:55,801 --> 00:54:57,740
I think that one of the
most important things is,

841
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:02,760
is to dismiss the concept of a process
or a rule that always works in the

842
00:55:03,781 --> 00:55:05,430
absence of superior judgement.

843
00:55:05,810 --> 00:55:08,310
Is the judgment,
the,

844
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:13,730
the decision to take a certain path
versus another. In other words,

845
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:16,730
and I know I'm going to be
bastardizing this, but if, if,

846
00:55:16,790 --> 00:55:20,240
if an advantage could take the form
of access to better information,

847
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:24,000
better analysis of that information,
uh,

848
00:55:24,110 --> 00:55:28,850
making a better decision with the,
with that information that is available,

849
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,260
having the courage to act on it,

850
00:55:30,261 --> 00:55:34,010
and then the emotional fortitude to
either act on it or also sit with that

851
00:55:34,011 --> 00:55:35,530
decision.
And there,

852
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:38,600
there may be other behavioral
psychological advantages or disadvantages.

853
00:55:38,601 --> 00:55:41,450
I'm sure there are.
When you talk about judgment,

854
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:46,400
is that a particular link in that,
in that chain?

855
00:55:46,401 --> 00:55:47,234
Is it a,

856
00:55:48,310 --> 00:55:52,030
I think judgment is
everything. Uh, for example,

857
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:54,190
just to follow your taxonomy,

858
00:55:55,030 --> 00:55:59,920
judgment is knowing when you have
information that others don't.

859
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:03,910
And if you think,
you know something that others don't,

860
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:08,320
it's knowing when yours is likely to
be valid and not knowing whether you're

861
00:56:08,410 --> 00:56:12,130
likely to be off beat.
It's understanding how to analyze it.

862
00:56:12,131 --> 00:56:14,260
It's judgment is,
is,

863
00:56:14,290 --> 00:56:18,400
is the reaching of conclusions
based on your analysis. Um,

864
00:56:18,550 --> 00:56:23,550
and a judgment is all we have to tell
us when something goes against us,

865
00:56:25,001 --> 00:56:28,960
whether we should hang
in or give up. So, uh,

866
00:56:29,710 --> 00:56:31,810
as I say,
I think it's all judgment.

867
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:37,020
I would imagine a lot of people read
your memos and your writing to develop in

868
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:42,460
hopes of developing better judgment.
And that while there,

869
00:56:42,490 --> 00:56:47,260
there is no one rule that will work
for all circumstances, all cases.

870
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:52,860
There may be certain questions
or tools that proof helpful in,

871
00:56:54,641 --> 00:56:59,020
uh, in a greater percentage of
cases than others. And to, to that,

872
00:56:59,170 --> 00:57:04,120
I would love to refer to a few
things that I have in front of me.

873
00:57:04,121 --> 00:57:04,561
One is,

874
00:57:04,561 --> 00:57:09,520
is a letter that you sent to me along
with the book and towards the end of the

875
00:57:09,521 --> 00:57:13,120
letter, it's, it, uh, it says,

876
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:16,480
I draw my 50 years of investing experience
to provide an orientation to the

877
00:57:16,481 --> 00:57:18,430
usual cycles in the economy,
corporate profits,

878
00:57:18,431 --> 00:57:21,040
the availability of credit and the
securities markets as well as some of the

879
00:57:21,041 --> 00:57:24,670
less ordinary ones. For example, in
distress debt, investor psychology,

880
00:57:24,671 --> 00:57:26,510
and even in success.
But I think potentially,

881
00:57:26,830 --> 00:57:30,820
I think potentially the most
useful chapter or the most
useful is the chapter on

882
00:57:30,821 --> 00:57:33,010
the cycle and attitudes towards risk.

883
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:35,590
How investors are thinking about
risk and behaving toward it.

884
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:39,340
At a point in time might be the single
most influential determinant of markets

885
00:57:39,341 --> 00:57:41,090
position in the cycle.
Uh,

886
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:45,340
and thus the best indicator of how we
should behave with regard to, and I,

887
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:50,590
I read that chapter, I believe I
had the right chapter and there's a,

888
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:55,480
there's a point in this chapter that is a,
that has a few lines bolded,

889
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:58,840
which I really appreciate by
the way. And it is, if I could,

890
00:57:59,050 --> 00:58:02,080
if I could ask only one question
regarding each investment I had under

891
00:58:02,081 --> 00:58:06,010
consideration, it would be simple how
much optimism is factored into the price.

892
00:58:07,330 --> 00:58:08,080
Uh,

893
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:13,080
could you talk about this question and
perhaps give some examples of using it or

894
00:58:14,651 --> 00:58:15,640
how people might use it?

895
00:58:16,130 --> 00:58:18,260
Sure.
You know,

896
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:22,010
I started in the business in
a summer job at Citi Bank,

897
00:58:22,090 --> 00:58:23,930
summer 68 50 years ago.

898
00:58:24,410 --> 00:58:28,610
And the bank was an investor in the
fifth what was called the nifty 50 the 50

899
00:58:28,611 --> 00:58:30,800
best and fastest growing
companies in America.

900
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:34,100
And if you bought the stocks the year
I showed up and held him five years,

901
00:58:34,101 --> 00:58:36,890
you've lost almost all of your money
in the best companies in America.

902
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:41,630
Then 10 years later, I switched to
the, uh, so-called junk bond business,

903
00:58:41,631 --> 00:58:42,470
high yield bonds.

904
00:58:42,770 --> 00:58:46,340
Now I'm lending money to the worst
companies in America and I'm making money

905
00:58:46,341 --> 00:58:49,170
steadily and consistently. So, uh,

906
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:54,340
clearly buying good things can't be
the secret to success in investing and

907
00:58:54,441 --> 00:58:59,030
avoiding bad things.
It has to be the price you pay.

908
00:58:59,510 --> 00:59:04,280
It's not what you buy, it's
what you pay. And there are,

909
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:08,690
there's no asset which is so good
that it can't become overpriced.

910
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:10,400
This is of course,

911
00:59:10,401 --> 00:59:13,640
something that people have to bear in
mind when they look at the Fang stocks.

912
00:59:14,330 --> 00:59:19,070
And on the other hand, those who don't
know could fangs, Facebook, Amazon,

913
00:59:19,071 --> 00:59:23,360
Netflix, Google, and, and
they throw in alphabet too.

914
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:26,240
Um,
and um,

915
00:59:26,870 --> 00:59:31,870
so there is no asset which is so
good that it can't be overpriced.

916
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:36,360
There are very few assets which are so
bad that they can't be underpriced and us

917
00:59:36,361 --> 00:59:40,730
a bargain. So what we have to look for if
we're going to be successful investors.

918
00:59:40,770 --> 00:59:43,690
Uh, now my school, which
is called value investing,

919
00:59:43,730 --> 00:59:48,730
puts more emphasis than perhaps a
venture capital or or growth investing,

920
00:59:48,861 --> 00:59:51,740
which largely looks for brilliant futures.

921
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:57,130
But the key is paying a low price
relatives on to something called intrinsic

922
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:03,200
value. If you pay a high
price relative to the value,

923
01:00:03,201 --> 01:00:05,170
you're unlikely to do well and yeah,

924
01:00:05,210 --> 01:00:07,910
probably have to get lucky
to have a good return.

925
01:00:08,030 --> 01:00:12,440
But if you pay a low price relative to
the intrinsic value, then the odds, again,

926
01:00:12,441 --> 01:00:15,110
like my book says are,
are on your side.

927
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:20,510
So we want low price to value.
How do you get low price to value?

928
01:00:20,870 --> 01:00:22,910
And the answer is low optimism.

929
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:26,090
There are other ways to describe it.

930
01:00:26,190 --> 01:00:28,310
You mean looking for low overall optimism,

931
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:32,210
right? If, if, if the insured,

932
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:37,780
the things that everybody feels good
about are likely to be the things that are

933
01:00:38,391 --> 01:00:42,770
high priced and the things that everybody
feels bad about are likely to be low

934
01:00:42,771 --> 01:00:47,180
price. So, uh, if you
could find out that here's,

935
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:52,100
here's a stock, nobody thinks this
company can ever have a good day,

936
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:54,490
maybe there's a chance to do,

937
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:58,070
produce some favorable surprises and
make you a lot of money. If there's a,

938
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:01,730
if there's a s a company
like the nifty 50 back in 68,

939
01:01:01,910 --> 01:01:03,890
everybody assumed literally,
Tim,

940
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:07,130
nothing bad could ever
happen to these stocks,

941
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:11,750
then clearly there has to be so much
optimism and the price that it's,

942
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:14,900
that there'll never,
there can never be favorable surprise.

943
01:01:15,020 --> 01:01:18,420
We make money from favorable surprises.
And if,

944
01:01:18,470 --> 01:01:22,610
if the conviction of a
positive conviction is so high,

945
01:01:22,611 --> 01:01:27,200
then by definition there can never
be a favorable surprise. So, uh,

946
01:01:27,201 --> 01:01:30,500
I think that this is a number one concept.

947
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:35,820
You, you, you, you
mentioned, uh, this, I think,

948
01:01:35,821 --> 01:01:40,260
I think you said the word never
in this sort of hypothetical, uh,

949
01:01:42,030 --> 01:01:46,500
exuberant enthusiasm. But someone
might say, and what I believe you,

950
01:01:46,590 --> 01:01:49,020
there's certain words you
dislike using pay, pay,

951
01:01:49,021 --> 01:01:50,670
pay attention to when they come up

952
01:01:51,610 --> 01:01:56,520
of the, uh, of this, uh, lack of,
uh, intellectual Hubris, right?

953
01:01:57,790 --> 01:02:00,760
We should never say,
never.

954
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:06,130
Always has to,
can't,

955
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:08,220
you know, these, these,

956
01:02:08,250 --> 01:02:13,250
these expressions are far too absolute
to be winners in a world beset by

957
01:02:17,890 --> 01:02:22,890
uncertainty. And, um, and uh, when you,

958
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:26,760
when you use those words, uh,
you tend to get into big trouble

959
01:02:27,690 --> 01:02:31,800
when assessing a public sentiment.

960
01:02:31,801 --> 01:02:33,600
And I think it could be really wide.

961
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:38,070
Let's say anyone participating in
the SB 500, it could be narrower,

962
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:42,900
but let's, let's assume we're
looking at the, the, the broad,

963
01:02:43,190 --> 01:02:47,160
uh, the broadest collection of market
participants at least, let's just,

964
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:48,930
let's just say s and p 500.

965
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:53,130
I was texting with a friend of
mine who's a successful investor,

966
01:02:53,131 --> 01:02:57,390
very different stylistically than
yourself. And I asked him, I said, what,

967
01:02:57,480 --> 01:03:01,460
what would people use are, or what
do you invest in pros use or what's,

968
01:03:01,470 --> 01:03:05,530
what do some of them use to measure
how feel fearful or greedy? Uh,

969
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:09,180
and then in quotation marks, the market
is, are there, go to indices, are poles.

970
01:03:09,181 --> 01:03:13,200
And he said, people use the vix
as a measure of fear Vix. Uh,

971
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:14,750
and then,
uh,

972
01:03:15,450 --> 01:03:19,500
he said some people might use something
like yield on junk bonds as a measure.

973
01:03:20,030 --> 01:03:24,570
In other words, low yield equals
complacent market. What are,

974
01:03:25,110 --> 01:03:29,550
let's say, it seems so difficult to
keep track of the media as a whole,

975
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:33,030
although certainly it becomes obvious at
some point if it's all negative or all

976
01:03:33,570 --> 01:03:35,990
positive. Are there, uh,

977
01:03:36,690 --> 01:03:40,090
particular indicators that you
like to pay attention to or,

978
01:03:40,130 --> 01:03:43,950
or your affirm likes to,
to at least keep an eye on?

979
01:03:44,770 --> 01:03:45,790
In the old book,

980
01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:49,750
there's a chapter that talks about the
importance of taking the temperature of

981
01:03:49,751 --> 01:03:54,170
the market, knowing where
we stand. And it has a, it,

982
01:03:54,190 --> 01:03:57,670
it includes with a checklist,
uh,

983
01:03:58,060 --> 01:04:00,190
largely tongue in cheek,
uh,

984
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:04,990
called the poor man's guide to market
assessment and basically ask them simple

985
01:04:04,991 --> 01:04:09,490
questions. What's going on? Are,
are if a new fund comes out,

986
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:14,650
does it sell out immediately
or does it struggle? Um, if,

987
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:19,330
uh, if, uh, if an investor goes to a
cocktail party, yeah, there you are.

988
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:22,850
It's also a new book. Oh, it's also in
the new model. It's great. It's, you know,

989
01:04:23,690 --> 01:04:26,730
if an, if an investor like me
goes to a cocktail party, is he,

990
01:04:26,731 --> 01:04:29,260
is he the center of attention
that everybody wants to talk to?

991
01:04:29,261 --> 01:04:34,261
Well that's probably a sign
that the interest in the
market is too high or is he

992
01:04:34,630 --> 01:04:39,570
pushed into a corner and everybody wants
to talk to, to the, uh, athletes and the,

993
01:04:39,571 --> 01:04:40,840
and the venture capital guys.

994
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:45,220
And that's probably an indication that
interested my part of the market is too

995
01:04:45,221 --> 01:04:49,960
low and that bargains may be available.
Uh, you know, and when you turn on TV,

996
01:04:50,290 --> 01:04:53,830
uh, is it all they want to talk about
is the good news or the bad news?

997
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:58,470
And I have some cartoons
in, in, in the notebook,

998
01:04:58,660 --> 01:05:03,580
uh, old cartoons dredged up
from my files. Uh, but you know,

999
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:05,440
um, it, it just,

1000
01:05:05,620 --> 01:05:10,620
they demonstrate that virtually everything
in the world and in the markets is

1001
01:05:11,261 --> 01:05:15,400
subject to a either positive or a
negative interpretation. And if, if,

1002
01:05:15,430 --> 01:05:18,610
if everybody is interpreting positively,

1003
01:05:18,850 --> 01:05:23,680
that tells me that the,
that the spirits are too high and,

1004
01:05:23,750 --> 01:05:27,520
and perhaps ready to be dashed
and, and vice versa. You know,

1005
01:05:27,521 --> 01:05:32,521
the greatest thing I was ever taught
was back around 73 74 somebody said,

1006
01:05:33,341 --> 01:05:35,920
I'm going to tell you about the
three stages of the bull market.

1007
01:05:36,370 --> 01:05:37,690
And in the first stage,

1008
01:05:38,140 --> 01:05:43,140
just a few incredibly insightful
people understand that there could be

1009
01:05:45,491 --> 01:05:48,280
improvement.
And in the second stage,

1010
01:05:48,281 --> 01:05:52,060
most people recognize that
improvement is actually taking place.

1011
01:05:52,420 --> 01:05:53,740
And in the third stage,

1012
01:05:53,890 --> 01:05:57,580
everybody and his brother believes that
things will only get better forever.

1013
01:05:58,450 --> 01:06:03,250
Now I think this is number one, this is
a very accurate description of the world.

1014
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:05,463
Number two,

1015
01:06:05,770 --> 01:06:10,770
clearly if you buy in the first stage
when only a few people understand the

1016
01:06:11,501 --> 01:06:12,700
potential for improvement,

1017
01:06:12,970 --> 01:06:17,970
you're going to pay a low price because
there isn't much optimism in the price.

1018
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:22,810
Then as you progress to
the second and third stage,

1019
01:06:24,610 --> 01:06:29,610
the UN anticipated improvement takes
place that gives the market a favorable

1020
01:06:30,971 --> 01:06:31,804
surprise.

1021
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:36,640
The stock prices or the asset prices
rise in response to those favorable

1022
01:06:36,641 --> 01:06:40,030
surprises. Um, and uh,

1023
01:06:40,060 --> 01:06:45,060
but you eventually reach a point where
the good news convinces people that it's

1024
01:06:46,940 --> 01:06:48,220
going to go on forever.

1025
01:06:48,970 --> 01:06:52,270
And when everybody believes that
things will get better forever,

1026
01:06:52,420 --> 01:06:56,410
clearly it's likely that so much
optimism is in the stock price,

1027
01:06:56,680 --> 01:07:00,610
that it's dangerous and
unlikely to yield a profit.

1028
01:07:00,611 --> 01:07:05,170
So I think that the three stages of the
bull market, uh, and conversely of the,

1029
01:07:05,171 --> 01:07:08,080
of the bear market are really important,

1030
01:07:08,590 --> 01:07:12,490
not as a money making rule,

1031
01:07:12,730 --> 01:07:16,240
but as something to bear
in mind and watch out for.

1032
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:22,680
I'm going to ask you a few questions
that, that, uh, you may not like,

1033
01:07:22,740 --> 01:07:26,460
but that my fans will kill
me for if I don't ask.

1034
01:07:26,461 --> 01:07:28,200
So where,
uh,

1035
01:07:28,860 --> 01:07:32,280
it gets number one is where do
you think we are at the moment?

1036
01:07:32,490 --> 01:07:35,660
And of course this has to be
timestamped. Uh, and then we're,

1037
01:07:35,661 --> 01:07:37,650
we're talking about in the August,
2018

1038
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:41,820
and what has you worried,

1039
01:07:42,510 --> 01:07:46,310
what has you optimistic if you're
optimistic about anything? Sure. Well,

1040
01:07:46,490 --> 01:07:49,730
where are we for the last 10 years?
Ever since the crisis,

1041
01:07:50,090 --> 01:07:54,380
people have been asking that question in
the form of what inning are we in? Eh,

1042
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:58,720
when they asked it in late oh eight,
what they really meant was, uh,

1043
01:07:58,790 --> 01:08:01,520
how much longer will the pain go on?
Uh,

1044
01:08:01,670 --> 01:08:05,480
now what they're asking is how much longer
will the pleasure go on and the bull

1045
01:08:05,481 --> 01:08:08,390
market and the economic recovery,

1046
01:08:08,750 --> 01:08:12,230
I think we're in the eighth inning now.
You don't have to timestamp.

1047
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:15,960
But because I've been saying
this for awhile, um, and,

1048
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:20,660
and I'm likely to continue to do so.
But about a year ago,

1049
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:23,750
I came to realization
that that observation,

1050
01:08:24,260 --> 01:08:28,520
even if accurate is of limited use.
Because unlike baseball,

1051
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:32,120
we don't know how many innings there are
in a game. This is a big distinction.

1052
01:08:32,390 --> 01:08:34,730
In a normal baseball game,
we know there are nine innings.

1053
01:08:34,731 --> 01:08:37,610
If I say we're in the eighth,
and if I say it accurately,

1054
01:08:37,850 --> 01:08:40,520
that means the good
times are about to end.

1055
01:08:40,850 --> 01:08:45,320
But in economies and markets,
there is no fixed duration.

1056
01:08:46,220 --> 01:08:50,570
So the bull market,
this is the 10th year.

1057
01:08:51,290 --> 01:08:55,580
That's a long time in
the economic recovery.

1058
01:08:55,581 --> 01:08:57,890
This month we have begun the 10th year.

1059
01:08:58,550 --> 01:09:01,970
The longest economic recovery
in recent history is 10 years.

1060
01:09:02,390 --> 01:09:05,720
So these observations start to tell you,

1061
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:11,210
not that it's gonna end, but that the
likelihood of its continuing is declining.

1062
01:09:11,211 --> 01:09:14,690
The odds are not on your side.
When you're in the 10th year,

1063
01:09:14,810 --> 01:09:18,620
the odds of having 10 more years
of recovery seemingly are not good.

1064
01:09:18,860 --> 01:09:22,130
We don't know if there's some reason why
there has never been a recovery of more

1065
01:09:22,131 --> 01:09:26,060
than 10 years. Uh, but we
have to wonder if there is.

1066
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:30,320
Um, but on the other hand,
we can't be too sure. Uh,

1067
01:09:30,350 --> 01:09:34,970
now I believe that this economic recovery
for many years was the slowest on

1068
01:09:34,971 --> 01:09:35,804
record.

1069
01:09:36,410 --> 01:09:41,410
That is probably helpful because that
kept excesses from coming into existence

1070
01:09:43,401 --> 01:09:47,670
that have to be corrected, uh,
with a, with a downturn. Um,

1071
01:09:47,810 --> 01:09:49,580
so you asked about the good news.

1072
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:53,000
The good news is that the economy
is functioning at a high level.

1073
01:09:53,210 --> 01:09:57,470
We just had a quarter of
unusually rapid growth. Um,

1074
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:59,960
unemployment is declining.

1075
01:10:00,380 --> 01:10:05,030
Our economy is the envy of
the world. Um, stock prices,

1076
01:10:05,060 --> 01:10:10,060
which were very high when measured by
price earnings ratio last year are not so

1077
01:10:10,731 --> 01:10:15,731
expensive this year because the earnings
have been supercharged by the tax bill.

1078
01:10:16,260 --> 01:10:21,100
The projected earnings of the s and
p 500, uh, our, our way up this year,

1079
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:25,370
23%, I think, which is
unusual and higher earnings.

1080
01:10:25,820 --> 01:10:29,960
Everything else being equal means I
lower price earnings ratio. So on Mo,

1081
01:10:29,990 --> 01:10:30,890
by most measures,

1082
01:10:31,750 --> 01:10:35,720
a stocks are only slightly
expensive at this point in time.

1083
01:10:36,410 --> 01:10:40,190
So that's the good news.
The bad news is number one,

1084
01:10:40,191 --> 01:10:45,020
interest rates are likely to increase and
interest rates increased the burden of

1085
01:10:45,021 --> 01:10:45,980
debt on companies.

1086
01:10:46,340 --> 01:10:50,420
And when bonds yield more,

1087
01:10:50,450 --> 01:10:54,290
they offer more competition for stocks.
Uh,

1088
01:10:54,380 --> 01:10:58,820
clearly there are a lot of uncertainties
in the macro world and the geopolitical

1089
01:10:58,821 --> 01:11:03,040
world and the political
world. Um, the, the,

1090
01:11:03,041 --> 01:11:07,350
the greatest of which is the
possibility of a trade war, which, uh,

1091
01:11:08,690 --> 01:11:12,640
almost everybody thinks would
be extremely negative, uh,

1092
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:16,830
not only for the u s and for the
people who engage in the trade war,

1093
01:11:16,831 --> 01:11:21,780
but for everyone. And, uh,
I think that interestingly,

1094
01:11:21,781 --> 01:11:25,710
what we've been talking about is assessing
the level of investor psychology.

1095
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:30,240
I don't believe that investor
psychology is terribly frothy.

1096
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:35,250
The way I've put it in the past is
that people are not thinking bullish,

1097
01:11:35,490 --> 01:11:36,660
but they're acting bullish.

1098
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:41,490
A lot of people have moved into higher
risk investments in order to get the

1099
01:11:41,491 --> 01:11:45,600
returns they want because right now,
safe investments,

1100
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:46,760
treasuries and,

1101
01:11:46,830 --> 01:11:50,970
and high grade bonds and cash and
money markets or for so little.

1102
01:11:51,210 --> 01:11:56,210
So people have been forced to move out
the risk curve and take more risk and

1103
01:11:57,001 --> 01:12:01,640
that makes the world a riskier
place for you and me. Uh, I,

1104
01:12:01,740 --> 01:12:06,540
I borrowed a phrase from my late father
in law who said that those people could

1105
01:12:06,541 --> 01:12:08,610
be described as handcuffed volunteers.

1106
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:12,120
They're doing things not because they
want to, but because they have to.

1107
01:12:12,450 --> 01:12:17,450
But the effect on the market is the
same when people move to riskier actions

1108
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:19,740
that makes the market
riskier for everyone.

1109
01:12:21,530 --> 01:12:25,570
So if we were to consider all of that,
uh,

1110
01:12:25,610 --> 01:12:30,610
if you had say three people
come to you and you had to,

1111
01:12:30,830 --> 01:12:33,800
you had to give them some responses
because that's like a mother in law,

1112
01:12:33,801 --> 01:12:36,290
people in the family. So you have
to give them some kind of response.

1113
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:40,340
And I might be, feel free to
ask some clarifying questions,

1114
01:12:40,370 --> 01:12:44,690
but let's say someone has a
hundred k to invest 1 million,

1115
01:12:44,930 --> 01:12:49,400
10 million to invest,
so a hundred k 1 million and 10 million,

1116
01:12:49,430 --> 01:12:54,430
they make $100,000 a year that is
going to remain stable and predictable.

1117
01:12:54,981 --> 01:12:59,090
It's just assume that on the income
side, uh, they are very cautious.

1118
01:12:59,091 --> 01:13:00,230
I think like a lot of people,

1119
01:13:00,260 --> 01:13:05,260
the loss aversion and pain of losing
$100 hurts much more than the joy they

1120
01:13:05,991 --> 01:13:08,550
derive from making $100.
Uh,

1121
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:13,310
and they have their investible funds,
in this case, a hundred k, 1 million,

1122
01:13:13,311 --> 01:13:18,311
10 million in cash or cash equivalence
or some of these safe vehicles currently.

1123
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:22,820
And they say, Howard, I don't know
to do. What are your thoughts?

1124
01:13:23,780 --> 01:13:24,613
I think that

1125
01:13:25,470 --> 01:13:30,470
one of the most important things of in
investing is to make people comfortable.

1126
01:13:32,050 --> 01:13:35,250
It's a mistake to sit there and say,
you should do this.

1127
01:13:35,251 --> 01:13:38,250
You should do that regardless
of people's comfort level.

1128
01:13:38,251 --> 01:13:40,230
Because if you violate
their comfort level,

1129
01:13:40,231 --> 01:13:43,770
if you force him into things that are too
risky for them, and then things go bad,

1130
01:13:44,220 --> 01:13:45,840
they're unlikely to do the right thing.

1131
01:13:45,870 --> 01:13:49,860
They're more likely to panic
and sell on the way on the lows,

1132
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:52,380
which is the cardinal sin of investing.
Uh,

1133
01:13:52,381 --> 01:13:57,381
so it's very important to assess people's
needs and ability to withstand tough

1134
01:13:59,431 --> 01:14:04,260
times. Um, clearly, uh, the
person who makes a hundred and,

1135
01:14:04,310 --> 01:14:04,610
and,

1136
01:14:04,610 --> 01:14:09,610
and has a hundred doesn't have a big
margin of safety for tough times and,

1137
01:14:10,770 --> 01:14:14,200
and, and they should invest,
uh, more conservatively.

1138
01:14:14,380 --> 01:14:17,280
The person with 10 million, um, uh,

1139
01:14:17,740 --> 01:14:19,960
depending on his psychology,
uh,

1140
01:14:20,020 --> 01:14:25,020
or her psychology probably would be
willing to stomach some losses in the

1141
01:14:27,611 --> 01:14:30,760
pursuit of big gains.
Um,

1142
01:14:30,790 --> 01:14:34,690
now people always over
estimate in advance.

1143
01:14:35,020 --> 01:14:39,670
They're the equanimity with which
they would greet losses. You know,

1144
01:14:39,671 --> 01:14:43,100
back in 1997, eight, nine, when the,

1145
01:14:43,270 --> 01:14:46,930
when the stock market and the tech
stocks were rocketing along what a,

1146
01:14:46,940 --> 01:14:50,350
what a lot of people I think
said is, well, I, I, you know,

1147
01:14:50,351 --> 01:14:54,070
my 401ks been doing so great. I wouldn't
mind if I lost a third of my money.

1148
01:14:54,460 --> 01:14:58,030
It's okay. Believe me, when, when,
when they lost a third of their money,

1149
01:14:58,031 --> 01:15:02,170
they weren't okay. Uh,
but you know, our mantra,

1150
01:15:02,171 --> 01:15:06,130
my mantra for the last few
years has been moved forward,

1151
01:15:06,131 --> 01:15:08,560
but with caution and,
and uh,

1152
01:15:08,590 --> 01:15:11,950
so in varying degrees to
those three people, uh,

1153
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:15,730
what I would say,
we are investing every day.

1154
01:15:16,270 --> 01:15:21,270
We are endeavoring to be fully invested
today other than in funds that are

1155
01:15:21,521 --> 01:15:25,480
strictly designated as standby
funds for the, for the crisis.

1156
01:15:25,930 --> 01:15:29,260
We are definitely taking risk.

1157
01:15:30,370 --> 01:15:33,370
But with caution,
we were cautious firm.

1158
01:15:33,790 --> 01:15:38,080
We invest in risky asset classes,
high yield bonds,

1159
01:15:38,081 --> 01:15:42,610
distressed debt, uh, real estate, emerging
market stocks and bonds, et Cetera.

1160
01:15:42,611 --> 01:15:43,120
These are,

1161
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:48,120
these are risky assets and oak tree
has always taken a low risk approach,

1162
01:15:48,910 --> 01:15:53,290
a controlled risk approach to those asset
classes. So when I say with caution,

1163
01:15:53,291 --> 01:15:55,300
I mean with more caution than usual.

1164
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:59,690
I think this is a time for
more caution than usual. Uh,

1165
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:04,030
and that's what I would tell those
people, but I don't. So I think that the,

1166
01:16:05,050 --> 01:16:06,700
the uh, the, uh,

1167
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:11,440
outlook is not so bad and the prices are
not so high that you have to practice

1168
01:16:11,441 --> 01:16:14,750
maximum defensiveness and go to cash and,
and,

1169
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:17,530
and suffer a 1% return on cash.

1170
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:21,070
But I think the outlook is not so
good and prices are not so low,

1171
01:16:21,071 --> 01:16:25,690
but this is time for aggressiveness
and I wouldn't be aggressive. The, the,

1172
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:31,800
I think one way to that I help
myself make these decisions,

1173
01:16:31,811 --> 01:16:34,090
and it might be helpful to your listeners,

1174
01:16:34,420 --> 01:16:39,420
is I constantly remind myself and others
that as an investor there are really

1175
01:16:40,811 --> 01:16:43,120
two key risks that we face every day.

1176
01:16:43,750 --> 01:16:46,570
Now the first one is obvious and everybody
knows about it's the risk of losing

1177
01:16:46,571 --> 01:16:49,930
money. What's the second? Not so
obvious, a little more subtle.

1178
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:54,250
It's the risk of missing
opportunity. And most people, if,

1179
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:57,970
if reminded of the twin risks, they
would say, well, I think that's right.

1180
01:16:58,150 --> 01:17:02,530
And the truth is that I don't want to lose
a lot of money. But on the other hand,

1181
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:05,650
I don't want to miss all the
opportunities. So I'm going to compromise,

1182
01:17:05,651 --> 01:17:09,530
I'm going to balance the two. I'm going
to do something kind of in the middle. Um,

1183
01:17:09,860 --> 01:17:14,420
and that makes sense. Everybody, you know,
other than daredevils and scaredy cats,

1184
01:17:14,690 --> 01:17:18,230
everybody should do something in the
middle. Exactly. Where in the middle is,

1185
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:23,320
is debatable and should be a tailored
to their own psyche and financial

1186
01:17:25,010 --> 01:17:28,850
position. So the interesting
question is, okay,

1187
01:17:29,210 --> 01:17:31,430
what about today?
Today,

1188
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:36,580
should you be at in your normal balance
between the twin risks or should it be

1189
01:17:37,791 --> 01:17:38,220
different?

1190
01:17:38,220 --> 01:17:42,950
Should you be in a higher risk position
because so many things yields a little

1191
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:45,170
or should you be in a lower risk position?

1192
01:17:45,171 --> 01:17:50,171
Because there are so many uncertainties
and I actually think the ladder so fully

1193
01:17:50,511 --> 01:17:55,280
invested and being cautious
does not mean being in cash,

1194
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:58,010
but everything you want to do
in the investment business,

1195
01:17:58,220 --> 01:18:01,010
there are higher and
lower risk ways to do it.

1196
01:18:01,190 --> 01:18:04,430
And I think today is a time
for the lower risk ways.

1197
01:18:05,460 --> 01:18:08,960
Uh, I, uh, you know, this is the,

1198
01:18:09,020 --> 01:18:11,510
this is not the first time I've
asked a question like this,

1199
01:18:11,511 --> 01:18:14,030
but the last time I asked
the first part of that,

1200
01:18:14,060 --> 01:18:16,140
which was making a hundred
grand a year, I've, uh,

1201
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:19,310
someone has a hundred grand grand to
spend was actually at the Berkshire

1202
01:18:19,310 --> 01:18:22,910
Hathaway shareholder meeting a long,
long time ago. And it was my, my,

1203
01:18:23,060 --> 01:18:27,650
my first and only time there and I
was so excited to be there. I mean,

1204
01:18:27,651 --> 01:18:31,760
it's Woodstock for investor
nerds and it was, it was,

1205
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:36,590
there was so much excitement. People
were camped out out front to be in line.

1206
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:40,670
I was part of that and I asked someone
working there where the microphone

1207
01:18:40,671 --> 01:18:42,500
wireless that was hardest to get to.

1208
01:18:42,830 --> 01:18:47,830
And then I sprinted over there and I was
able to ask a Warren and Charlie this

1209
01:18:48,021 --> 01:18:50,420
question,
of course,

1210
01:18:50,421 --> 01:18:55,140
you know them and the responses
can be very short. And, uh,

1211
01:18:55,990 --> 01:18:58,910
I said, if someone, hypothetically,
we're making $100,000 a year,

1212
01:18:58,911 --> 01:19:01,640
they had $100,000 to deploy in some way,

1213
01:19:02,270 --> 01:19:04,610
how would you suggest
they invest that capital?

1214
01:19:04,611 --> 01:19:08,090
And it was along the lines of invest in
the s and p 500 or a low cost index fund

1215
01:19:08,091 --> 01:19:09,620
in the SB 500 and get back to work.

1216
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:14,420
And I found that very dissatisfying.
But in retrospect,

1217
01:19:15,140 --> 01:19:19,680
uh, certainly not the worst advice
that you could get. Give someone, uh,

1218
01:19:19,910 --> 01:19:24,680
how, how do you, uh, what
do you disagree with,

1219
01:19:24,710 --> 01:19:27,980
with Warren most on,
what do you guys not see eye to eye on?

1220
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:32,430
You know, Tim, there's a book
out called the Warren Buffet Way,

1221
01:19:32,431 --> 01:19:35,580
and I was asked to write the
forward for the latest edition,

1222
01:19:35,850 --> 01:19:39,210
and I wrote something called what
Wakes Warren Buffet, Warren Buffet.

1223
01:19:39,211 --> 01:19:43,800
And I listed the things that characterize
him extremely high Iq, unemotional,

1224
01:19:44,580 --> 01:19:47,550
great analysts understand
what's important,

1225
01:19:47,910 --> 01:19:50,730
looks at the things that are important
and figures out their import,

1226
01:19:50,910 --> 01:19:53,820
ignores the things that are
unimportant and on and on like that.

1227
01:19:54,180 --> 01:19:57,930
And the last one was the most,
one of the most important.

1228
01:19:58,680 --> 01:20:03,540
He's not afraid of getting fired.
He doesn't have to worry about the,

1229
01:20:03,780 --> 01:20:07,920
the interim consequences
of error most people do.

1230
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:13,500
And, um, so, you know, okay,

1231
01:20:13,650 --> 01:20:16,580
so you say your, your advice is, uh,

1232
01:20:16,590 --> 01:20:20,100
or his advices invest in an index fund,
fine as far as it goes.

1233
01:20:20,101 --> 01:20:24,660
But how much should the person who has
100,000 put the whole hundred thousand in

1234
01:20:24,661 --> 01:20:27,750
the stock market, right? And
especially should they do it today?

1235
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:30,930
And if they do it all today,

1236
01:20:31,290 --> 01:20:34,800
we're confident the 20 years from now
they're going to have a lot more money and

1237
01:20:34,801 --> 01:20:39,750
they're going to be really happy.
What about a year from now? And, and,

1238
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:40,320
uh,

1239
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:45,320
not everybody is financially able to
live through a decline and emotionally

1240
01:20:49,291 --> 01:20:54,000
able.
And so as I said,

1241
01:20:54,510 --> 01:20:56,430
the first purpose of investing,

1242
01:20:56,460 --> 01:20:59,700
especially for people who have
more money than they need to eat,

1243
01:21:00,270 --> 01:21:01,620
should be to make you comfortable.

1244
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:07,800
When I started at bank Citibank 50 years
ago, they had a cartoon on the wall.

1245
01:21:07,890 --> 01:21:11,460
It said, scared money
never wins. And it's true.

1246
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:15,990
And so everybody should invest
only up to their comfort level.

1247
01:21:16,770 --> 01:21:20,040
And, uh, so I, I think I would, I,

1248
01:21:20,110 --> 01:21:24,210
I certainly agree with Warren that for
most people they can improve on an index

1249
01:21:24,211 --> 01:21:26,610
fund. But, but that's,

1250
01:21:26,700 --> 01:21:30,090
and I'm not saying that Warren says that
everybody should put 100% of their net

1251
01:21:30,091 --> 01:21:33,650
worth in the index fund, but
clearly they shouldn't. And,

1252
01:21:33,780 --> 01:21:35,830
and I was once at a,
uh,

1253
01:21:36,210 --> 01:21:40,590
at a talk and I was preceded by a,
by a college professor.

1254
01:21:40,591 --> 01:21:45,010
I wounded identify him. Uh,
Warren always says, uh, uh,

1255
01:21:45,210 --> 01:21:48,570
praise by name, criticized by
category. So I'll always say,

1256
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:54,270
so I'll say I was, I was
preceded by a college professor.
And here's what he said.

1257
01:21:55,770 --> 01:22:00,770
And this guy is known
for pro stocks attitudes.

1258
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:04,410
And he said,
if you are of average risk tolerance,

1259
01:22:04,411 --> 01:22:07,140
you should have 85% of your money in this.
No.

1260
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:10,470
If you're a below average risk tolerance,

1261
01:22:10,471 --> 01:22:15,300
85 average was Tom's 105.
If you're aggressive,

1262
01:22:15,460 --> 01:22:18,780
125% of your net worth should
be in the stock market.

1263
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:24,500
And I just think that most people
can't live in the long run,

1264
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:29,730
in the short run with the consequences
of being that much invested.

1265
01:22:30,390 --> 01:22:34,500
Uh, and, and, and, uh, being human.

1266
01:22:35,730 --> 01:22:37,830
We are our own worst enemy.

1267
01:22:38,610 --> 01:22:43,410
Everything that goes on in the world and
the market conspires to make people buy

1268
01:22:43,411 --> 01:22:46,920
when things are going well
and prices are high and sell,

1269
01:22:46,921 --> 01:22:50,940
when things are going badly and
prices are low. And, and fighting.

1270
01:22:50,941 --> 01:22:53,760
That is the number one theme of the book.

1271
01:22:54,060 --> 01:22:57,240
And it's the number one theme of,
of success.

1272
01:22:58,170 --> 01:23:00,330
Just from personal experience,
and I mentioned this earlier,

1273
01:23:00,331 --> 01:23:03,210
but looking at my response in say 2008,

1274
01:23:03,530 --> 01:23:06,010
I had bought a house in 2007 and with some

1275
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:09,630
very unfortunate, uh,
mortgage terms and, uh,

1276
01:23:10,060 --> 01:23:13,450
made some very bad decisions also with
money that I had in the stock market at

1277
01:23:13,451 --> 01:23:16,960
that time.
And I think in part it was because I,

1278
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:21,460
I couldn't have known how I would
respond under those circumstances.

1279
01:23:21,461 --> 01:23:26,461
And when I filled out this very templated
form of course for whoever it was at

1280
01:23:26,921 --> 01:23:30,040
the time,
I won't mention any anyone by name,

1281
01:23:30,310 --> 01:23:35,310
but it was to what extent would you be
comfortable with a drop in your portfolio

1282
01:23:36,221 --> 01:23:38,400
over one quarter or one year,
whatever the,

1283
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:40,870
the form of the question
was and had 10% 20%,

1284
01:23:40,871 --> 01:23:44,170
30% and 30% maybe.
I mean pulling it,

1285
01:23:44,171 --> 01:23:46,720
the answer out of thin air had to answer
it to get through the online form.

1286
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:50,050
But I'd never experienced
anything similar to that.

1287
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:53,620
And this just came to mind because
I'm looking at it on a book,

1288
01:23:53,860 --> 01:23:57,490
at a book on your shelf, uh,
bringing down the house about games.

1289
01:23:57,490 --> 01:24:00,910
We were talking about games earlier
as I understand it, Bill Gates,

1290
01:24:00,911 --> 01:24:03,880
I think also buffet played
a fair amount of bridge, uh,

1291
01:24:03,881 --> 01:24:07,360
certainly many people
in the investing world,

1292
01:24:08,110 --> 01:24:10,390
including some people who are
really, really, really fantastic.

1293
01:24:10,510 --> 01:24:14,830
Some of the guys from renaissance and so
on poker, uh, then you have backgammon.

1294
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:20,170
What do you play and what do you think
the game that they select says about the

1295
01:24:20,171 --> 01:24:21,220
person,
if anything,

1296
01:24:21,250 --> 01:24:26,110
and could playing those games help
someone to assess their risk tolerance for

1297
01:24:26,380 --> 01:24:29,530
larger types of investing?
Are there other ways to,

1298
01:24:29,590 --> 01:24:32,260
in any way accurately determine that?

1299
01:24:32,750 --> 01:24:37,700
I think accurately
determine, yes. Quantify. No.

1300
01:24:38,230 --> 01:24:39,800
Uh,
but I think that we

1301
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:45,770
can get a handle on our degree
of risk tolerance, risk aversion,

1302
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:49,820
and we should. And, um, you know,

1303
01:24:50,900 --> 01:24:51,733
uh,

1304
01:24:52,970 --> 01:24:55,630
I was with the, my son and, uh,

1305
01:24:55,700 --> 01:25:00,170
one of his friends this week and
his friend is a great chess player.

1306
01:25:00,860 --> 01:25:04,010
The interesting thing about people
who play chess is that in chess,

1307
01:25:04,011 --> 01:25:07,820
there's no randomness. Uh, you
know, there's no dice to roll.

1308
01:25:07,910 --> 01:25:12,190
There's no wind to blow a no
card to pick from the deck. And,

1309
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:13,033
and every,

1310
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:16,610
all the information is on the board
and everybody has all the information.

1311
01:25:16,850 --> 01:25:20,990
So it tells you something about
an intellectual process. Um,

1312
01:25:21,260 --> 01:25:25,310
and you know,
all the way out to craps,

1313
01:25:25,670 --> 01:25:28,790
which where everything's, uh, you know,

1314
01:25:28,820 --> 01:25:32,310
in play all the time based on randomness.
Um,

1315
01:25:32,870 --> 01:25:37,010
so maybe which game we like, uh,
tells us something about ourselves.

1316
01:25:37,011 --> 01:25:40,460
But how we play also tells us
about ourselves. Backgammon,

1317
01:25:40,461 --> 01:25:43,400
which is one of my main games,
uh,

1318
01:25:43,430 --> 01:25:48,260
which is highly probability intensive.
Um, cause it's all the dies.

1319
01:25:48,261 --> 01:25:52,910
It's the dice it and the skill. But
the dice mean a lot. Um, you know, in,

1320
01:25:53,330 --> 01:25:58,280
in any situation with any throw of the
dice there are aggressive and defensive

1321
01:25:58,281 --> 01:26:00,440
ways to play. So, you know,

1322
01:26:00,441 --> 01:26:05,441
probably the interesting thing was if
you played and I watched her for a couple

1323
01:26:05,750 --> 01:26:05,751
hours,

1324
01:26:05,751 --> 01:26:10,220
I would know if you're aggressive or
defensive or risk averse or risk tolerant

1325
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:14,360
and, and, and you should be able to do
the same for yourself. The one of the,

1326
01:26:14,450 --> 01:26:18,450
as I said before, one of the great
things is to understand ourselves. And,

1327
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:20,540
and without that we are really in trouble.

1328
01:26:21,830 --> 01:26:26,830
What are some of the things that otherwise
smart people miss about cycles or

1329
01:26:28,431 --> 01:26:31,610
misconceptions that they believe to be
true? Like you said with Mark Twain,

1330
01:26:31,611 --> 01:26:36,540
that just ain't so, I think the, well,

1331
01:26:36,541 --> 01:26:37,050
the,
the,

1332
01:26:37,050 --> 01:26:42,050
the biggest mistake you can make is ignore
the repetitive nature of the cyclical

1333
01:26:43,011 --> 01:26:47,360
pattern. Uh, Ray Dalio in
his, in his book principles,

1334
01:26:47,630 --> 01:26:48,463
uh,

1335
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:53,190
talks about how much analysis
he and his partners did. Uh,

1336
01:26:53,690 --> 01:26:58,460
the conclusion of which is the ability
to look at what's going on in the world

1337
01:26:58,461 --> 01:27:00,110
or in the market and say,
oh,

1338
01:27:00,111 --> 01:27:04,370
that's another one of those life becomes
very easy when you have studied the

1339
01:27:04,371 --> 01:27:09,110
past to the extent that you've seen the
recurring patterns and you can recognize

1340
01:27:09,111 --> 01:27:13,940
them when they come up again.
So, so, uh, I think that's,

1341
01:27:14,210 --> 01:27:18,530
I think that's extremely important.
Um, but the other thing is,

1342
01:27:18,531 --> 01:27:22,700
and I think the guiding
quote of the book is a,

1343
01:27:23,270 --> 01:27:27,890
is another one from Mark Twain. History
does not repeat, but it does rhyme.

1344
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:29,930
History does not repeat,

1345
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:34,610
the cycles are not ever the
same in terms of amplitude,

1346
01:27:35,330 --> 01:27:37,760
speed,
duration,

1347
01:27:38,450 --> 01:27:41,960
cause or ramifications.

1348
01:27:43,490 --> 01:27:44,630
But they do.

1349
01:27:44,660 --> 01:27:49,660
There are themes that repeat that can
help us to identify and properly respond

1350
01:27:51,891 --> 01:27:54,230
to cyclical occurrences.

1351
01:27:54,980 --> 01:27:58,610
So I say in the book that I,
you know,

1352
01:27:58,611 --> 01:28:02,600
I've been in the high yield bond business
now for 40 years and there was a time

1353
01:28:02,601 --> 01:28:07,601
when there arose a body of thought
that most defaults a car on bonds,

1354
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:16,270
second anniversary since issuance.
And I don't,

1355
01:28:16,280 --> 01:28:19,040
I don't think there's anything
magical about the second anniversary.

1356
01:28:19,340 --> 01:28:22,160
And you know,
if people believe that,

1357
01:28:22,310 --> 01:28:26,270
then they would sell all the
bonds they had that were 23 years,

1358
01:28:27,050 --> 01:28:28,100
23 months old,

1359
01:28:28,250 --> 01:28:31,580
and by him back when there were 25
months old if they had survived.

1360
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:34,940
But I don't think they would accomplish
anything by that because they were,

1361
01:28:34,970 --> 01:28:36,940
I think they were, they were, uh,

1362
01:28:36,990 --> 01:28:41,990
assigning an import to a
number that was not a valid.

1363
01:28:42,440 --> 01:28:47,440
So I think it's really important to
recognize cycles and understand them.

1364
01:28:49,580 --> 01:28:54,580
I think it's unimportant to assign
importance to these numbers who are rules.

1365
01:28:56,570 --> 01:29:01,010
Uh, but it's very important to
understand what's going on around us.

1366
01:29:01,230 --> 01:29:06,030
And when, when, when the recovery
is old, the bull market is old,

1367
01:29:06,031 --> 01:29:09,450
the psychology is elevated, the, the, uh,

1368
01:29:09,750 --> 01:29:11,460
the valuations are high,

1369
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:16,500
then you should know that the odds are
not on your side and you should take some

1370
01:29:16,501 --> 01:29:19,710
money off the table and behave in a
more cautious way. And vice versa.

1371
01:29:20,780 --> 01:29:25,600
I suppose also on some level necessitates
cultivating a fair degree of patients.

1372
01:29:25,980 --> 01:29:27,890
Uh,
I mean it would seem

1373
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:30,580
patients is,
patients is essential.

1374
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:34,510
There was a investment sage named
Peter Bernstein, and he said,

1375
01:29:34,511 --> 01:29:36,670
the market is not an
accommodating machine.

1376
01:29:36,671 --> 01:29:39,640
He will not give you high returns
because you need or want them.

1377
01:29:40,450 --> 01:29:41,740
And you know,

1378
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:46,090
if I believe that right now we're
living in a low return world.

1379
01:29:47,370 --> 01:29:47,780
Okay.

1380
01:29:47,780 --> 01:29:50,540
And if you say,
Howard,

1381
01:29:51,910 --> 01:29:55,090
I need high returns in a low return world,

1382
01:29:55,390 --> 01:30:00,220
the only way to try to get them is by
taking a lot of risk. And by definition,

1383
01:30:00,221 --> 01:30:02,560
taking a lot of risk is,
is,

1384
01:30:02,620 --> 01:30:05,710
is not sure to work and could
have negative consequences.

1385
01:30:06,130 --> 01:30:08,860
So I believe that when
you're in a low return world,

1386
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:13,240
you have to accept it and
deal accordingly. Now,

1387
01:30:13,241 --> 01:30:17,200
this comes from Joel, which we
started the interview with. Uh,

1388
01:30:17,201 --> 01:30:21,520
I talked about Mojo in a memo about 20
years ago. Entitled, it is what it is.

1389
01:30:21,940 --> 01:30:25,340
I think one of the most important
things that we can do as adults, be it,

1390
01:30:25,370 --> 01:30:30,370
be it in the investment world or the
real world is to say it is what it is.

1391
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:35,740
In other words, accept things for what
they are, deal with them as they are.

1392
01:30:36,100 --> 01:30:40,570
Don't spend a lot of time wishing
they were different. Uh, you know,

1393
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:42,100
certainly don't

1394
01:30:42,670 --> 01:30:42,960
okay.

1395
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:47,220
Act as if they were different. Uh,
we have to accept the realities.

1396
01:30:47,620 --> 01:30:51,370
I've, uh, not that in my,

1397
01:30:51,430 --> 01:30:56,290
in my little tiny corner of
investing, which is, I mean,

1398
01:30:57,580 --> 01:31:01,180
not even worth mentioning, we late
in this conversation, but I, I,

1399
01:31:01,270 --> 01:31:06,270
I only bring it up to tie it to how
helpful actually reading certain,

1400
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:08,740
I'm not going to,
it's not quite scripture,

1401
01:31:08,741 --> 01:31:13,741
but Buddhist thinking related to
concepts like Mojo and stoic philosophy,

1402
01:31:13,901 --> 01:31:15,810
Epictetus and so on.
Uh,

1403
01:31:15,880 --> 01:31:20,880
how helpful that has been to
tempering emotional reactivity.

1404
01:31:21,740 --> 01:31:26,710
Uh, you mentioned someone I want to it
to come back to for a second. Uh, Peter,

1405
01:31:26,770 --> 01:31:31,390
is it Bernstein or Stein? Ernestine
Bernstein, financial historian. Uh,

1406
01:31:31,540 --> 01:31:34,450
sadly passed away. I
think it was in 2009. I,

1407
01:31:35,680 --> 01:31:39,310
I've read that you consider him one of
the smartest people you've ever met. Why,

1408
01:31:39,340 --> 01:31:41,680
why is that? Are there any other
things that you learned from him?

1409
01:31:42,710 --> 01:31:46,640
48 years ago when I was a junior analyst
following xerox for Citibank and I

1410
01:31:46,641 --> 01:31:50,600
would give the portfolio managers at the
bank my opinions when I'm came up to me

1411
01:31:50,601 --> 01:31:54,500
and said, who is the best analyst on
Wall Street on Xerox? And I said, well,

1412
01:31:54,501 --> 01:31:56,960
the one who agrees with me the most is so,
and so.

1413
01:31:57,140 --> 01:32:00,310
We always think that the people
who agree us are really smart.

1414
01:32:00,730 --> 01:32:04,900
And Peter saw the world the way I did,

1415
01:32:05,110 --> 01:32:09,590
but in many cases put it into
words better. Uh, and um,

1416
01:32:10,250 --> 01:32:12,980
um, I wrote him a memo, uh,

1417
01:32:13,270 --> 01:32:18,270
called risk in o six row
risk revisited in 14.

1418
01:32:18,670 --> 01:32:23,180
And then bizarrely one day I
found a memo from him. You pay,

1419
01:32:23,230 --> 01:32:25,960
you mentioned he passed
away in o nine. In, in 16,

1420
01:32:25,961 --> 01:32:27,520
I found a memo for whom all my desk,

1421
01:32:27,521 --> 01:32:31,630
my desk is a little messy and there's a
lot of stuff floating around and it was

1422
01:32:31,631 --> 01:32:36,610
a great memo entitled, uh, can
risk be reduced to a number.

1423
01:32:38,110 --> 01:32:43,110
And I took a bunch of stuff from that
in a Redo of my memo entitled risk

1424
01:32:46,331 --> 01:32:51,100
revisited again. Um, but I just, I
just think that Bernstein is great.

1425
01:32:51,210 --> 01:32:53,590
And, and, and in on the subject of risk,

1426
01:32:53,591 --> 01:32:58,480
he said every day we
walk into the unknown.

1427
01:32:59,650 --> 01:33:03,730
Um, and, and as I said,

1428
01:33:04,850 --> 01:33:05,231
you know,

1429
01:33:05,231 --> 01:33:09,970
the future is a distribution
of possibilities and some
days we don't even know

1430
01:33:09,971 --> 01:33:12,170
what the possibilities are.
And,

1431
01:33:12,330 --> 01:33:17,290
and I conclude if I can borrow your
copy of the book, I can include,

1432
01:33:17,910 --> 01:33:22,000
uh, with, with a quote from him, uh,

1433
01:33:22,030 --> 01:33:25,040
because I think it's so good and,
uh,

1434
01:33:25,870 --> 01:33:28,210
if I can find it quickly,

1435
01:33:28,570 --> 01:33:31,870
he said the future is not ours to know,

1436
01:33:32,050 --> 01:33:35,710
but it helps to know that being
wrong is inevitable and normal,

1437
01:33:35,830 --> 01:33:39,640
not some terrible tragedy,
not some awful failing and reasoning.

1438
01:33:39,641 --> 01:33:42,070
Not even bad luck in most instances.

1439
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:48,120
Being wrong comes with the franchise of
an activity whose outcome depends on an

1440
01:33:48,520 --> 01:33:52,280
unknown future.
And I think that that's a great way to,

1441
01:33:52,350 --> 01:33:55,870
to think about the world
we have to work in.

1442
01:33:56,230 --> 01:34:01,230
And if you accept and
inhale the unpredictability,

1443
01:34:06,070 --> 01:34:10,270
variability and randomness of the world,

1444
01:34:10,570 --> 01:34:14,470
I think you're likely to
do a lot better in it. Now,

1445
01:34:15,010 --> 01:34:16,780
that doesn't mean you can't invest.

1446
01:34:16,810 --> 01:34:20,020
You can invest even boldly.

1447
01:34:20,650 --> 01:34:24,820
What it means is you have to assume that
things are not going to always work out

1448
01:34:24,821 --> 01:34:27,910
right away. Well, of course they're
not always going to work out,

1449
01:34:28,060 --> 01:34:31,570
but they're certainly not always gonna
work out right away, which means what?

1450
01:34:31,660 --> 01:34:34,660
You have to have patience. You have
to same power. You have the fortitude,

1451
01:34:34,840 --> 01:34:36,850
you have to,
uh,

1452
01:34:37,980 --> 01:34:40,390
not invest so much that
if it goes against you,

1453
01:34:40,391 --> 01:34:45,160
you're going to panic and get out.
Uh, preparing for an unknown world,

1454
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:46,450
unpredictable,

1455
01:34:46,900 --> 01:34:51,900
maybe even hostile world in the short
run is probably a lot smarter than

1456
01:34:52,090 --> 01:34:54,850
assuming everything's going to go
right and it's going to go the way you

1457
01:34:54,851 --> 01:34:56,980
expected and it's going
to go that way right away.

1458
01:34:56,990 --> 01:35:01,950
And you're not going to be tested.
Uh, and, uh, so I, I think that the,

1459
01:35:01,990 --> 01:35:06,230
this is the kind of thinking
that, that, that, uh, you know,

1460
01:35:07,220 --> 01:35:11,630
when I read Bernstein or, or some of the
other people I've mentioned, you know,

1461
01:35:11,660 --> 01:35:15,800
I just go, oh yeah, right, sure.
That, that gets it for me. You know,

1462
01:35:16,160 --> 01:35:18,200
and that's why I love his stuff so much.

1463
01:35:19,650 --> 01:35:24,130
Uh, Warren Buffet has mentioned how
Fante is of your writing and that,

1464
01:35:24,670 --> 01:35:25,660
and I'm paraphrasing here,

1465
01:35:25,661 --> 01:35:28,410
but if he sees it in his inbox
where he sees one of your letters,

1466
01:35:28,411 --> 01:35:31,240
it's one of the first things or the
first thing that he'll pick up to read.

1467
01:35:33,100 --> 01:35:36,220
I'd love to ask you about your reading.
Are there any,

1468
01:35:36,790 --> 01:35:41,790
say three to five specific newsletters
or columnists or economists or writers

1469
01:35:42,041 --> 01:35:45,940
who you find yourself excited to read
these days? Anyone who comes to mind?

1470
01:35:47,450 --> 01:35:51,450
I th I think the best, uh, you know,

1471
01:35:51,480 --> 01:35:55,530
I worked mainly in the credit area,
not the stock market. So, you know,

1472
01:35:55,740 --> 01:35:59,760
most people invest mainly in the stock
market and we've talked a lot about the

1473
01:35:59,761 --> 01:36:04,260
stock market. Uh, but that's not
what I do professionally. And, uh,

1474
01:36:04,290 --> 01:36:09,030
our oak trees investing is largely in,
in something called credit, which means,

1475
01:36:09,270 --> 01:36:13,410
uh, fixed income securities,
bonds and notes and loans, uh,

1476
01:36:13,470 --> 01:36:18,300
not issued by governments. That's
the definition of credit. Um,

1477
01:36:18,930 --> 01:36:20,670
and in,
in our world,

1478
01:36:20,671 --> 01:36:24,720
I think that is a great newsletter
called grant's interest rate observer.

1479
01:36:25,110 --> 01:36:29,700
It's a little ironic because it grants
has nothing to do with interest rates are

1480
01:36:29,701 --> 01:36:33,900
almost nothing, but it's about credit
and it, and, and in particular,

1481
01:36:34,170 --> 01:36:37,320
it exposes a stupidity.

1482
01:36:38,040 --> 01:36:43,040
And it exposes companies which seem to
be where people are not bringing enough,

1483
01:36:46,270 --> 01:36:48,630
uh,
skepticism and,

1484
01:36:48,660 --> 01:36:52,520
and deals that seem unwise
and that kind of thing. And,

1485
01:36:52,521 --> 01:36:55,470
and I think they do a great job.
Now it,

1486
01:36:55,730 --> 01:37:00,360
I think it's fair to say that it
has a negative cast. In other words,

1487
01:37:00,510 --> 01:37:03,350
they're mainly talking
about things which are,

1488
01:37:03,750 --> 01:37:05,550
which are rated higher
than they should be,

1489
01:37:05,551 --> 01:37:08,940
which you should avoid or bet against.

1490
01:37:09,540 --> 01:37:13,560
I don't think they as often talk about
the things that are rated lower than they

1491
01:37:13,561 --> 01:37:18,060
should be and present
profit opportunities. But
for credit guys like us,

1492
01:37:18,380 --> 01:37:22,950
uh, avoiding the losers is
extremely important. And,
and I think that's a great,

1493
01:37:23,140 --> 01:37:24,240
a great newsletter,

1494
01:37:24,450 --> 01:37:29,450
not only for the content but for the
attitude and the importance of identifying

1495
01:37:31,680 --> 01:37:36,000
misperceptions. You know,
the misperception is the
key to operating in the,

1496
01:37:36,001 --> 01:37:40,590
in the markets and the variant perception.

1497
01:37:40,860 --> 01:37:45,030
You understand things differently from
the way everybody else understands them

1498
01:37:45,210 --> 01:37:47,800
is the key to success.
Assuming you're right, uh,

1499
01:37:48,210 --> 01:37:51,570
if you understand everything
just the way everybody else does,

1500
01:37:51,900 --> 01:37:53,340
clearly you can outperform.

1501
01:37:53,341 --> 01:37:57,690
That's the death knell for would
be a professional investor.

1502
01:37:57,870 --> 01:38:01,860
So you have to have, you have to
see things different from others.

1503
01:38:03,090 --> 01:38:05,640
That's a necessary condition
for outperformance,

1504
01:38:05,790 --> 01:38:10,480
but you also have to see it better than
others. That's necessary to, uh, that the,

1505
01:38:10,490 --> 01:38:13,920
the two, the combination of those two is
what I call second level thinking, which,

1506
01:38:14,130 --> 01:38:15,600
which I mentioned a couple of times.

1507
01:38:16,360 --> 01:38:19,250
You also mentioned how widely read,
uh,

1508
01:38:19,420 --> 01:38:23,240
Charlie Munger is and certainly in
poor Charlie's Almanack for instance,

1509
01:38:23,410 --> 01:38:28,410
he talks quite a bit about if I'm not
missing Mr roaming a evolutionary biology

1510
01:38:28,721 --> 01:38:29,554
and,
and,

1511
01:38:29,590 --> 01:38:34,590
and really is able to pull concepts from
seemingly unrelated disciplines into

1512
01:38:37,241 --> 01:38:42,040
his sort of power zone of,
of investing. Uh, and, uh,

1513
01:38:43,210 --> 01:38:47,160
I've had investors
recommend certain books are,

1514
01:38:47,210 --> 01:38:51,130
are much broader than investing,

1515
01:38:51,430 --> 01:38:54,220
such as lessons of history
by will and Ariel Durant,

1516
01:38:54,221 --> 01:38:58,640
which I found really fascinating also,
I mean, talks about cycles in a way. Uh,

1517
01:38:58,680 --> 01:39:03,680
are there any books that
you found recommending a lot
or that you've enjoyed in

1518
01:39:05,111 --> 01:39:08,620
the last few years that are
not specific to investing?

1519
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:11,690
Uh, not specific. Yes. My,

1520
01:39:11,720 --> 01:39:16,250
my reading is usually closer
in a that then Charlie's a,

1521
01:39:16,251 --> 01:39:20,930
so an example, uh, is the book I'm working
on now, which is called fact fullness.

1522
01:39:21,390 --> 01:39:25,140
Um, and basically it, it,

1523
01:39:25,190 --> 01:39:30,190
it unmasks a lot of misperceptions
that people have about the state of the

1524
01:39:30,591 --> 01:39:33,330
world. Uh, and, uh,

1525
01:39:34,460 --> 01:39:38,360
they hold these
perceptions, uh, generally,

1526
01:39:38,361 --> 01:39:40,550
qualitatively not based on data.

1527
01:39:40,850 --> 01:39:45,530
And the author tries to substitute
facts for these perceptions,

1528
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:46,820
Eh,
eh,

1529
01:39:46,940 --> 01:39:51,020
he starts with a list of 13 questions
describing the state of the world.

1530
01:39:51,320 --> 01:39:56,240
And fascinatingly, uh, the,

1531
01:39:56,570 --> 01:39:57,870
I guess he,

1532
01:39:57,920 --> 01:40:01,570
it gives you the answer to one and
you have to think about the answer.

1533
01:40:01,590 --> 01:40:05,390
The other 12,
the average score on the 12 is too,

1534
01:40:06,380 --> 01:40:09,740
and he points out that if you flip
the coin, you'd get six, right?

1535
01:40:09,980 --> 01:40:14,480
So the average American gets
two of the 12 questions, right?

1536
01:40:14,660 --> 01:40:17,690
And so not only are they
systematically wrong,

1537
01:40:17,930 --> 01:40:20,060
but they're wrong in the same direction,

1538
01:40:20,180 --> 01:40:25,180
which is they always pick
the more pessimistic answer
when the more optimistic

1539
01:40:27,051 --> 01:40:28,700
one is true.
And so he's,

1540
01:40:28,730 --> 01:40:33,680
he responds to our bias and he tries
to overcome the ignorance and the bias,

1541
01:40:33,890 --> 01:40:38,130
uh, by, by using facts and,
and, and, and some great, uh,

1542
01:40:38,240 --> 01:40:42,260
very communicative graphics.
So I would recommend, uh,

1543
01:40:42,700 --> 01:40:46,490
impactfulness and I love the
idea of unmasking biases.

1544
01:40:46,950 --> 01:40:50,880
You mentioned that, uh, and if I
get this wrong, as I'm restating,

1545
01:40:50,881 --> 01:40:54,790
please correct me,
but for in a low yield environment

1546
01:40:55,090 --> 01:40:59,940
to get high yield entails increased risk.
Uh,

1547
01:40:59,941 --> 01:41:04,400
I know you've written a little bit
about cryptocurrency before. Uh,

1548
01:41:04,450 --> 01:41:08,680
the last I saw was about I think, I
think for about a year ago. What is your,

1549
01:41:08,860 --> 01:41:12,220
what is your current view or
thoughts on cryptocurrency, if any?

1550
01:41:13,720 --> 01:41:16,530
That's one place that people are going,
uh,

1551
01:41:16,570 --> 01:41:21,570
often with no understanding of
the technology or anything else.

1552
01:41:21,821 --> 01:41:23,980
I mean it scares me enough,
although anyway,

1553
01:41:24,280 --> 01:41:28,300
I won't get into my view on that stuff.
But people who are well outside of tech,

1554
01:41:28,301 --> 01:41:30,880
well outside of all that getting very,

1555
01:41:30,881 --> 01:41:33,940
very bullish as it relates
to cryptocurrency. But
what are your thoughts?

1556
01:41:34,520 --> 01:41:37,100
I am what is called a value investor.

1557
01:41:37,670 --> 01:41:41,720
And that means you look at the situation,
you don't look at the atmospherics,

1558
01:41:41,721 --> 01:41:46,280
you don't look at the aesthetics,
you look at the value,

1559
01:41:46,281 --> 01:41:48,590
hard value, uh, the,

1560
01:41:48,890 --> 01:41:53,890
the company's assets and the cash flow
that is business producers and you value

1561
01:41:55,131 --> 01:41:58,970
those things and you come to something
called the intrinsic value and then you

1562
01:41:58,971 --> 01:42:03,680
see if you can buy it for less.
If you pay full intrinsic value,

1563
01:42:03,681 --> 01:42:05,960
you'll probably get a fair return.
If you pay more,

1564
01:42:05,961 --> 01:42:08,060
you'll probably have an
unsuccessful experience.

1565
01:42:08,061 --> 01:42:10,190
But if you can buy it for less
than the intrinsic value, you,

1566
01:42:10,300 --> 01:42:14,450
you should have an above average return.
That's value investing.

1567
01:42:15,020 --> 01:42:19,910
And I think it is the
intellectually sound,

1568
01:42:19,911 --> 01:42:21,230
this form of investing.

1569
01:42:21,830 --> 01:42:26,090
And nobody has been able to tell me
the intrinsic value of a bitcoin.

1570
01:42:26,900 --> 01:42:31,280
I believe there are assets in this
world where you can come up to intrinsic

1571
01:42:31,281 --> 01:42:35,360
value and they are the ones
that produce cashflow companies,

1572
01:42:36,020 --> 01:42:39,380
stocks, bonds, buildings,

1573
01:42:40,250 --> 01:42:41,180
that kind of thing.

1574
01:42:41,540 --> 01:42:44,390
There are a lot of assets in this
world to do not produce cash flow.

1575
01:42:44,391 --> 01:42:48,890
You cannot put an intrinsic value on
oil,

1576
01:42:50,450 --> 01:42:54,980
gold, diamonds, paintings, bitcoin.

1577
01:42:55,760 --> 01:43:00,650
Does it apply to all currencies?
Yes it does. Yes it does. Uh,

1578
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:07,480
we cannot say how many
pounds a dollar is worth.

1579
01:43:11,860 --> 01:43:13,340
Um,
we,

1580
01:43:13,400 --> 01:43:17,960
we people look at them in terms of
what's called purchasing power parody,

1581
01:43:18,380 --> 01:43:20,750
but it doesn't really work very well.

1582
01:43:21,110 --> 01:43:26,110
And the truth of the matter is that these
macro considerations to directions of

1583
01:43:26,571 --> 01:43:28,060
economies and,
and,

1584
01:43:28,061 --> 01:43:32,840
and markets and the currencies and PR,
commodity prices,

1585
01:43:32,841 --> 01:43:36,210
I mean, what's the intrinsic
value of an orange, you know, um,

1586
01:43:37,310 --> 01:43:41,210
these things I think can't
be predicted reliably.

1587
01:43:41,420 --> 01:43:45,950
And in fact the so called macro funds
have been doing quite poorly for years.

1588
01:43:46,430 --> 01:43:49,130
Um, so, uh,

1589
01:43:49,850 --> 01:43:52,520
there are some things can be
valued in some things a can.

1590
01:43:52,550 --> 01:43:55,370
And I believe that bitcoin is one
of the ones that can't be valued.

1591
01:43:55,640 --> 01:43:57,980
And everybody says to me,
but you don't understand.

1592
01:43:58,370 --> 01:44:02,900
And I wrote about this in
my July 17 memo and, and uh,

1593
01:44:03,050 --> 01:44:07,010
and return to it in September, I learned
something between July and September.

1594
01:44:07,011 --> 01:44:09,560
That's why I put it in the next memo to,
um,

1595
01:44:10,970 --> 01:44:12,620
people said you just don't understand.

1596
01:44:13,010 --> 01:44:17,300
People are going to want a currency that
the government can't deflate and that

1597
01:44:17,301 --> 01:44:22,160
can't be counterfeited and can't be
stolen and all these things. And um,

1598
01:44:22,850 --> 01:44:24,650
so, uh, that's why I returned to it,

1599
01:44:25,670 --> 01:44:28,460
but I still don't understand
how it can be valued.

1600
01:44:28,640 --> 01:44:33,640
I don't [inaudible] today a bitcoin
is $6,500 here on August the 10th.

1601
01:44:34,940 --> 01:44:39,940
And I don't see how you can say it's worth
7,500 or 5,500 or anything like that.

1602
01:44:41,060 --> 01:44:44,120
You can say it's going to
be useful in the future.

1603
01:44:44,121 --> 01:44:47,300
You can say people want occurrancy
a nongovernmental currency,

1604
01:44:47,510 --> 01:44:50,960
but I don't see how you can put
a value on it. And, and uh, uh,

1605
01:44:51,470 --> 01:44:56,470
with all of its attractions to the extent
that people find attractions in it.

1606
01:44:57,890 --> 01:45:01,670
Last year it went from 1000 to 19,000.

1607
01:45:02,930 --> 01:45:07,550
Now, I could be wrong, but that
tells me it's speculative buying.

1608
01:45:08,340 --> 01:45:10,460
Uh,
and by the way,

1609
01:45:10,700 --> 01:45:14,360
the people who remember what I said
about people who have opinions believe in

1610
01:45:14,361 --> 01:45:17,840
their right. Obviously the
people who it traded at 19,000,

1611
01:45:17,930 --> 01:45:21,230
somebody thought it was a good buy
at 19,000 cause it was going higher.

1612
01:45:21,231 --> 01:45:25,070
And today it's a third of that.
So for the most part,

1613
01:45:26,090 --> 01:45:30,920
reasonably valued value investments
do not go up 19 times in a year.

1614
01:45:30,921 --> 01:45:32,780
And then down by two thirds.

1615
01:45:34,100 --> 01:45:38,010
Are there any understanding that
you are a value investor? Um, you,

1616
01:45:38,070 --> 01:45:41,010
you mentioned a few other names and the
bit in the introduction of your book,

1617
01:45:41,011 --> 01:45:45,420
Joel Greenblatt, uh,
who I'm also a fan of.

1618
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:51,180
Are there any growth investors,
venture investors who are,

1619
01:45:51,810 --> 01:45:55,410
uh, is certainly a person thinks
differently, but are there,

1620
01:45:55,411 --> 01:45:56,610
are there any particular growth?

1621
01:45:56,611 --> 01:46:01,140
Are Venture investors or people who are
playing a slightly different approach

1622
01:46:01,470 --> 01:46:06,090
who you have a lot of respect for
or admire for particular reasons?

1623
01:46:06,240 --> 01:46:07,073
Sure.

1624
01:46:07,130 --> 01:46:10,250
Let me say,
there are many ways to invest.

1625
01:46:10,730 --> 01:46:15,410
There are many people who engage in
activities that I think can't be done.

1626
01:46:16,100 --> 01:46:20,920
And there are many people in each one
who do very well. So, you know, I,

1627
01:46:20,921 --> 01:46:21,620
I don't,

1628
01:46:21,620 --> 01:46:26,240
I don't say mine is the only
way in venture as an example,

1629
01:46:26,780 --> 01:46:30,910
and I'm not a futurist, I'm not a dreamer.
I'm not highly risk tolerance. Uh,

1630
01:46:31,070 --> 01:46:34,940
I'm not biased to risk
taking. And if, if it,

1631
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:38,540
40 years ago when Citi Bank said to me
they wanted me to start at a high yield

1632
01:46:38,541 --> 01:46:40,160
bond portfolio,
if instead they would have said,

1633
01:46:40,161 --> 01:46:44,200
I want you to start a venture capital
fund, I probably would have been disaster.

1634
01:46:44,710 --> 01:46:48,060
Um, but in the venture
field, you know, the, the,

1635
01:46:48,061 --> 01:46:52,380
the firms that success
seems to be recurring,

1636
01:46:52,770 --> 01:46:55,830
not random. You know, if, if,

1637
01:46:55,831 --> 01:46:58,160
let's say 20%,

1638
01:46:58,200 --> 01:47:03,200
10% of venture capital
funds are successful,

1639
01:47:03,660 --> 01:47:06,900
you would think that any given firearm,

1640
01:47:07,530 --> 01:47:09,570
20% of their funds would be successful.

1641
01:47:09,570 --> 01:47:13,950
But there are firms which are
repeatedly successful. Um, you know,

1642
01:47:14,100 --> 01:47:14,820
uh,

1643
01:47:14,820 --> 01:47:19,700
I was lucky in the last year to get
to meet Bill Gurley of benchmark and,

1644
01:47:19,701 --> 01:47:23,760
and, and bill was nice enough to give me
a blurb for the jacket in my book. Uh,

1645
01:47:24,060 --> 01:47:28,860
and, and I was very impressed by our
conversation and by, uh, benchmarks,

1646
01:47:29,370 --> 01:47:34,350
a record of achievement and
Sequoyah has a great record,

1647
01:47:34,550 --> 01:47:38,700
um, and, um, you know,
climate Parkins, et cetera.

1648
01:47:38,990 --> 01:47:43,670
Uh, so you can do it. Uh,

1649
01:47:43,950 --> 01:47:47,670
but it wouldn't be right for me.
That doesn't mean it's not right for them.

1650
01:47:48,090 --> 01:47:50,580
The macro, there are, you know,

1651
01:47:50,581 --> 01:47:54,690
I said 15 minutes ago that macro
funds have had pretty bad record.

1652
01:47:55,020 --> 01:47:58,500
Some of the greatest investors in
history have been macro investors. Uh,

1653
01:47:58,501 --> 01:48:02,550
George Soros and Stan
Druckenmiller, for example, uh,

1654
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:06,480
have been fabulous. They, they, they
probably have the highest returns of,

1655
01:48:06,481 --> 01:48:10,950
of everybody, um, and
quantitative investing,

1656
01:48:10,951 --> 01:48:14,490
renaissance and so forth. So, uh, again,

1657
01:48:14,491 --> 01:48:16,680
it would be a terrible form
of Hubris to say, my aunt,

1658
01:48:16,730 --> 01:48:20,760
my way is the only way my way's the
way we're way that works for me.

1659
01:48:20,910 --> 01:48:23,160
And by the way,
if you look at the others,

1660
01:48:23,730 --> 01:48:26,750
the success ratio is not terribly high.
Uh,

1661
01:48:27,090 --> 01:48:29,610
but certainly there are
people who've done it. Great.

1662
01:48:30,710 --> 01:48:35,420
Yeah, there's a very high concentration
of success and a handful at least within

1663
01:48:35,421 --> 01:48:38,660
venture. Uh, yeah.
Bill's a very smart guy.

1664
01:48:38,870 --> 01:48:42,460
And all the firms you mentioned
have done really, really well. Uh,

1665
01:48:43,490 --> 01:48:47,330
so I, I've heard said, ah, this is not,
not from, not from you in these words,

1666
01:48:47,331 --> 01:48:49,100
I don't think, but that, you know,

1667
01:48:49,101 --> 01:48:53,720
the right decision at the wrong
time is the wrong decision. And, uh,

1668
01:48:54,680 --> 01:48:55,160
I'm,

1669
01:48:55,160 --> 01:49:00,160
I'm very excited about the new book
and the literacy of cycles that you are

1670
01:49:04,371 --> 01:49:08,390
helping people to do develop
with this. Uh, and, uh,

1671
01:49:08,420 --> 01:49:10,870
we're gonna wrap up in
just a few questions. Um,

1672
01:49:11,450 --> 01:49:15,680
are there any particular,
uh,

1673
01:49:15,830 --> 01:49:20,390
mental models or heuristics that are in
this book or that you've used in your

1674
01:49:20,391 --> 01:49:24,560
investing life do you think
are particularly valuable
kind of across the board

1675
01:49:25,130 --> 01:49:28,820
in life? I know it's a big
question and you probably have, uh,

1676
01:49:29,090 --> 01:49:31,370
quite a few different directions
you could go with that.

1677
01:49:31,430 --> 01:49:34,850
But just in terms of
becoming a clearer thinker,

1678
01:49:35,390 --> 01:49:37,550
a better operating human being,
does this,

1679
01:49:37,730 --> 01:49:42,730
does anything come to mind that we haven't
discussed so far as it relates to any

1680
01:49:42,741 --> 01:49:46,940
type of mental model that
would be worth mentioning?

1681
01:49:47,200 --> 01:49:48,020
We wrap up.

1682
01:49:48,020 --> 01:49:49,460
Well, you know, Tim,

1683
01:49:49,670 --> 01:49:53,510
when I finished writing the book
and I was thinking about cycles,

1684
01:49:54,100 --> 01:49:58,370
I said to myself, so for example,
the economy grows about two,

1685
01:49:58,371 --> 01:50:01,100
two and a half percent a year on average.

1686
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:05,270
Why doesn't it just grow two and
a half percent year every year?

1687
01:50:05,870 --> 01:50:09,770
Why is it sometimes four and sometimes
one and sometimes five and sometimes

1688
01:50:09,771 --> 01:50:10,604
negative.

1689
01:50:11,090 --> 01:50:15,110
And the answer is accesses
and their correction.

1690
01:50:16,160 --> 01:50:21,160
And people get too excited and they
overexpand their businesses or they invest

1691
01:50:21,651 --> 01:50:26,651
too much or they invest too much using
debt and then something goes wrong and,

1692
01:50:26,801 --> 01:50:27,501
and that,

1693
01:50:27,501 --> 01:50:32,501
and their accesses are produced
booms and then something goes wrong.

1694
01:50:33,890 --> 01:50:37,490
And those excessive activities
turned out to be unsustainable.

1695
01:50:37,640 --> 01:50:41,510
And they are then corrected by selling
off inventory, closing plants or,

1696
01:50:41,750 --> 01:50:45,410
or liquidating leverage portfolio
and those produce busts.

1697
01:50:46,190 --> 01:50:48,800
So accesses and their correction.

1698
01:50:49,070 --> 01:50:53,510
And I think the best thing that people
can do is be on the lookout for those

1699
01:50:53,511 --> 01:50:57,980
things. And when other people are
engaging in accesses to the upside,

1700
01:50:58,460 --> 01:50:59,870
we should turn cautious.

1701
01:51:00,110 --> 01:51:03,470
And when other people are over
correcting to the downside,

1702
01:51:03,471 --> 01:51:07,650
we should turn aggressive. And,
uh, and, and I think, you know,

1703
01:51:07,660 --> 01:51:11,870
it's been a big part of what Bruce and
I have accomplished for the oak tree

1704
01:51:11,871 --> 01:51:16,370
investors and my other
partners and colleagues to,

1705
01:51:16,700 --> 01:51:21,500
uh, and, and it's something
that everybody can do if they,

1706
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:24,710
um,
if they turn their mind to it.

1707
01:51:26,690 --> 01:51:30,530
Well, Howard, I really appreciate
the time today. Good. This is,

1708
01:51:31,210 --> 01:51:34,400
this is,
this is very fun for me and hopefully,

1709
01:51:34,790 --> 01:51:38,390
and I believe will be valuable for people
listening just to mention a few things.

1710
01:51:38,391 --> 01:51:41,900
Of course people can find mastering
the market cycle, subtitle,

1711

Linkedin, all the same Howard marks book.

1715
01:51:58,730 --> 01:52:03,320
Is there anything else that you would
like to say to the people listening and he

1716
01:52:04,340 --> 01:52:08,300
recommendation question,
they should ponder action.

1717
01:52:08,301 --> 01:52:11,990
You might ask them to take
anything at all. Uh, besides, uh,

1718
01:52:12,170 --> 01:52:14,150
besides the book itself,
which I encourage people to check out.

1719
01:52:14,340 --> 01:52:17,430
Well, first of all, we've made
repeated reference to my memos.

1720
01:52:17,670 --> 01:52:22,060
They're all available
online@oaktreecapital.com, uh,

1721
01:52:22,710 --> 01:52:25,110
under the heading of
insights chairman's memos.

1722
01:52:25,120 --> 01:52:28,020
You can get the last 29 years worth.

1723
01:52:28,021 --> 01:52:31,920
You can also sign up for a service that
will notify you when one is published.

1724
01:52:32,160 --> 01:52:36,640
The price is right because they're
free. Uh, and, and I hope people will,

1725
01:52:36,660 --> 01:52:37,493
will read them.

1726
01:52:37,590 --> 01:52:42,390
And then I just want to say that I like
to hear from people so I don't always

1727
01:52:42,391 --> 01:52:46,400
have time to answer everybody,
but my of the memos

1728
01:52:46,400 --> 01:52:50,630
and the books has been enormously
rewarding because I get lovely memos from

1729
01:52:50,631 --> 01:52:55,100
people would say, uh, that I
made a complex things seem clear.

1730
01:52:55,270 --> 01:52:57,740
Um, that's the one that
gets me going the most.

1731
01:52:57,741 --> 01:53:02,741
So if people want to comment or
if they want to take issue or,

1732
01:53:03,050 --> 01:53:05,690
or ask a question,
I'll try to get back to them.

1733
01:53:06,250 --> 01:53:08,630
And this is the best way to reach out,

1734
01:53:08,631 --> 01:53:12,090
to send you a note on social media or a,

1735
01:53:12,100 --> 01:53:16,430
I would advise against giving out any
type of email address that will get

1736
01:53:16,431 --> 01:53:17,960
delusion,
but um,

1737
01:53:18,050 --> 01:53:21,970
or maybe the answer is they should figure
it out while we're on social media and

1738
01:53:21,980 --> 01:53:24,970
we'd be glad to hear
from there. Perfect. Uh,

1739
01:53:25,010 --> 01:53:28,910
why are to thank you again so much for
the time and for everybody listening

1740
01:53:28,940 --> 01:53:33,940
links to everything we discussed will
be in the show notes as usual@tim.blog

1741
01:53:34,191 --> 01:53:38,150
forward slash, podcast. And until
next time. Thank you for listening.

1742
01:53:39,620 --> 01:53:42,980
Hey guys, this is Tim again. Just a
few more things before you take off.

1743
01:53:43,370 --> 01:53:46,690
Number one, this is five
bullet Friday. Do you

1744
01:53:46,850 --> 01:53:49,250
want to get a short email from me?

1745
01:53:49,280 --> 01:53:53,420
Would you enjoy getting a short email
from me every Friday that provides a

1746
01:53:53,421 --> 01:53:56,990
little more soul of fun before the
weekend and five bullet Friday is a very

1747
01:53:56,991 --> 01:54:01,340
short email where I share the coolest
things I've found or that I've been

1748
01:54:01,341 --> 01:54:02,630
pondering over the week.

1749
01:54:02,870 --> 01:54:05,630
That could include favorite new
albums that I've discovered.

1750
01:54:05,631 --> 01:54:09,080
It could include Gizmos and gadgets
and all sorts of weird shit that I've

1751
01:54:09,081 --> 01:54:13,400
somehow dug up in the other
world of the esoteric as I do.

1752
01:54:13,670 --> 01:54:18,670
It could include favorite articles that
I've read and that I've shared with my

1753
01:54:19,341 --> 01:54:22,040
close friends for instance,
and it's very short.

1754
01:54:22,160 --> 01:54:27,110
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness
before you head off for the weekend,

1755
01:54:27,200 --> 01:54:29,360
so if you want to receive that,

episode is brought to you by helix sleep.

1759
01:54:43,130 --> 01:54:46,400
Last year I focused on dramatically
improving a few things. Surprise,

1760
01:54:46,401 --> 01:54:49,460
surprise most.
It'll be the quality of my sleep,

1761
01:54:49,461 --> 01:54:54,020
which seems to affect just
about everything. This led
me to revisit, you name it,

1762
01:54:54,170 --> 01:54:57,710
my daily routine, morning
routine, exercise, diet,

1763
01:54:57,740 --> 01:55:01,700
all the way to what I slept on and I
ended up getting all new beds here in

1764
01:55:01,701 --> 01:55:05,090
Austin, Texas, including
mattresses from Helix sleep.

1765
01:55:05,410 --> 01:55:09,260
He looks as built a slip quiz that takes
two minutes to complete and they use

1766
01:55:09,261 --> 01:55:12,620
the answers to match your body type
and sleep preferences to the perfect

1767
01:55:13,040 --> 01:55:16,040
mattress. Whether you're a side
sleeper, hot sleeper, cold sleeper.

1768
01:55:16,050 --> 01:55:18,740
Are you like flush?
You like firm with Helix,

1769

Just go to sleep.com forward slash Tim
take their two minutes sleep quiz and

give you the best sleep of your life.

1772
01:55:30,470 --> 01:55:32,300
That is their promise for couples.

1773
01:55:32,520 --> 01:55:34,490
It looks can even split the
mattress down in the middle,

1774
01:55:34,850 --> 01:55:38,660
providing individual support needs
and feel preferences for each side.

1775
01:55:38,661 --> 01:55:43,350
They have a 10 year warranty and you can
test drive your mattress for 100 nights.

1776
01:55:43,440 --> 01:55:44,310
Risk free.

1777
01:55:44,820 --> 01:55:49,820

He looks asleep.com/tim this
episode is brought to you by inc.

1782
01:56:08,600 --> 01:56:12,450
Tell used them personally. Ever since
I wrote the four hour work week,

1783
01:56:12,480 --> 01:56:16,530
I've been asked over and over again
how I choose to delegate tasks,

1784
01:56:16,860 --> 01:56:19,500
how I do 80 20 analysis and so on.

1785
01:56:19,800 --> 01:56:23,850
At the root of many of those decisions
is a simple question or actually two

1786
01:56:23,851 --> 01:56:24,684
questions.
Number one,

1787
01:56:24,690 --> 01:56:28,650
how can I invest money to improve my
quality of life and use that in investing

1788
01:56:28,830 --> 01:56:30,180
as well?
The second,

1789
01:56:30,450 --> 01:56:35,450
how can I spend a little money or moderate
money to save significant time inc

1790
01:56:35,911 --> 01:56:37,500
tell is one of those investments.

1791
01:56:37,620 --> 01:56:41,610
They're a turnkey solution for all of
your imaginable customer care units.

1792
01:56:42,300 --> 01:56:45,840
I used hotel during the launch of
the four hour body which was very,

1793
01:56:45,841 --> 01:56:50,250
very involved and they provided 24
seven customer service for my land rush

1794
01:56:50,251 --> 01:56:54,810
campaign because it was critical for
me to take care of every person who

1795
01:56:54,811 --> 01:56:58,650
purchased my books and participate in
this allowed me to focus on the things

1796
01:56:58,651 --> 01:57:00,210
that I am better at,

1797
01:57:00,240 --> 01:57:04,380
my strengths like marketing claim
that we'd worked on for six months

1798
01:57:04,440 --> 01:57:08,790
implementing that and until trains their
experience customer service reps to

1799
01:57:08,791 --> 01:57:12,390
know your business and your products
inside and out and make your customers

1800
01:57:12,400 --> 01:57:13,410
raving fans.

1801
01:57:13,440 --> 01:57:17,520
They answer more than a million customer
service requests every year and they

1802
01:57:17,521 --> 01:57:21,840
can do so across all platforms.
Giving email, phone, social media,

1803
01:57:21,841 --> 01:57:26,250
texts in chat,
leaving your customers with Horst Service,

1804
01:57:26,280 --> 01:57:28,760
or just mediocre service,
which by the way,

1805
01:57:28,860 --> 01:57:31,440
in a competitive pool is a huge liability.

1806
01:57:31,500 --> 01:57:36,500
Long wait times are unanswered messages
carries a massive cost and risk to your

1807
01:57:36,901 --> 01:57:41,620
business. Intel removes the logistics
headaches of this type of communication,

1808
01:57:41,650 --> 01:57:45,690
allowing you to focus on your
strengths and grow your business.

1809
01:57:46,230 --> 01:57:48,450
It can be a real competitive advantage.
And I see many,

1810
01:57:48,451 --> 01:57:53,451
many ecommerce companies
and tech companies thinking
of customer service as a

1811
01:57:53,670 --> 01:57:56,550
good enough checkbox for an afterthought.

1812
01:57:56,880 --> 01:58:01,880
And it just like airbnb
design and innovative ways
to be a competitor and to win

1813
01:58:03,300 --> 01:58:05,310
that you can do.
Same thing with customer service.

1814
01:58:05,580 --> 01:58:07,650
