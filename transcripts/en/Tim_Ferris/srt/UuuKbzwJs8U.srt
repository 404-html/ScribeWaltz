1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,890
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02,891 --> 00:00:06,110
I can run flat out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:13,630
I'm a cybernetic organism.

4
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:28,370
This episode is brought to you by convert
kit. My go to email service provider.

5
00:00:28,371 --> 00:00:31,790
I use them for everything. If you've
ever wondered how professional bloggers,

6
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:32,571
podcasters,

7
00:00:32,571 --> 00:00:37,430
youtubers and so on can build a platform
they control and get the word out about

8
00:00:37,431 --> 00:00:41,450
their best content. Email is still the
answer. People think it's all social,

9
00:00:41,451 --> 00:00:45,110
social, social, but one algorithm
change and oops, bait and switch.

10
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:46,850
Now you only reach 10% of your audience.

11
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,850
That is why I've doubled
and tripled down on email.

12
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,090
After reviewing many different
email service providers,

13
00:00:53,091 --> 00:00:56,690
I ended up selecting convert kit
for email like five bullet Friday,

14
00:00:56,691 --> 00:01:01,100
which goes out to about a million people
now because convert kit delivers on

15
00:01:01,101 --> 00:01:04,490
what matters most to me at
least easy to use. Systems,

16
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:08,120
split testing and resending
technology, both very, very important.

17
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:12,140
High rates of deliverability and
great hands on customer service.

18
00:01:12,141 --> 00:01:14,330
So whether you run a
business or simply have,

19
00:01:14,331 --> 00:01:19,070
say a serious blog convert kit has
integrations with more than 70 different

20
00:01:19,071 --> 00:01:22,520
services just about anything you might
need including hosting sites like

21
00:01:22,521 --> 00:01:24,740
wordpress,
ecommerce platforms like Shopify,

22
00:01:24,741 --> 00:01:28,370
lead capture technology like bounce
exchange or sumo and many more.

23
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:32,450
They also offer a visual
automation builder that makes
it really easy to deliver

24
00:01:32,451 --> 00:01:35,930
the right content to the right people
in your audience just when they want it.

25
00:01:35,931 --> 00:01:38,750
If you want a segment in different ways,
which a lot of people do,

26
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:42,410
convert kit offers, plans that
adjusted the size of your business,

27
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:46,280
so it's a good option whether you have
a thousand people or 1 million on your

28
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,000
list.

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,440
And certainly I am planning on growing
and growing and growing and I don't like

30
00:01:51,441 --> 00:01:53,000
switching email service providers,

31
00:01:53,001 --> 00:01:56,570
so I thought very carefully about this
before I selected them. So check it out.

This episode is brought to you by
wordpress.com I love wordpress.

41
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,900
I have used it for so many years.

42
00:02:36,901 --> 00:02:39,750
It's my goto platform for
blogging and creating websites.

43
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,770
I use wordpress.com for
everything every day. My site,

44
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,660
tim.blog is built on it. The websites
for my books, including tools of titans,

45
00:02:48,661 --> 00:02:53,580
tribe of mentors. It's all
on wordpress.com and the
founder Matt Mullenweg.

46
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,760
One of my close friends has
appeared on the show many times.

47
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:00,850
Just search Matt Mullenweg,
Tequila Ferris for quite an exciting time.

48
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:05,440
Whether you're looking to create a
personal blog, a business site, or both,

49
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:09,130
you can make a really big impact
right out of the box when you build on

50
00:03:09,131 --> 00:03:13,870
wordpress.com and you'll be
in good company. It's used
by the New Yorker, Jay Z,

51
00:03:13,871 --> 00:03:16,960
Beyonce, five 38 tech crunch, Ted, CNN,

52
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,420
and time just to name a handful,

53
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,840
and one
of my
friends@googlewhoshallremainnamelesshastoldmethatwordpress.com

54
00:03:26,171 --> 00:03:30,160
offers the best out of the
box SEO imaginable and quote,

55
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:34,990
and it's one of the many reasons that
nearly 30% of the Internet is run on

56
00:03:34,991 --> 00:03:35,824
wordpress.

57
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:39,670
You do not need experience or to hire
someone that's perhaps the best part.

58
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,340
wordpress.com guide you
through the entire experience.

59
00:03:42,341 --> 00:03:47,200
They have hundreds of
designs and templates that
you can use and it's easy to

60
00:03:47,201 --> 00:03:50,440
get started. There's no need to
worry about security upgrades,

61
00:03:50,441 --> 00:03:54,850
hosting any of that there for 24
seven support, and they're very,

62
00:03:54,851 --> 00:03:57,250
very responsive. If you have
questions, they get right back to you.

63
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:01,660
And this allows you to create the
highest quality with the least amount of

64
00:04:01,661 --> 00:04:04,930
headache and friction. So if
you're building a website, period,

65
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:09,070
when my friends come to me and ask
what I use, what I recommend they use,

66
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:12,850
the answer is wordpress.com

Hello boys and girls.

73
00:04:36,571 --> 00:04:39,870
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to
another episode of the Tim Ferriss show.

74
00:04:39,871 --> 00:04:44,871
End My brand new podcast tribe of mentors
because this guest is suitable for

75
00:04:45,481 --> 00:04:49,440
both Mike Maples. He's one of my favorite
people, one of my oldest mentors,

76
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,120
not in biological age,

77
00:04:51,121 --> 00:04:55,620
but he goes back probably 1520 years
teaching me and he is the man who

78
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:00,420
effectively taught me how to invest
and the audio you're going to hear was

79
00:05:00,421 --> 00:05:04,470
recorded in front of a sold out audience
at the Castro theatre in San Francisco.

80
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:05,221
It was a blast.

81
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:09,770
Thank you everyone for coming out and
it takes us a few minutes to warm up and

82
00:05:09,771 --> 00:05:14,180
then we get into not only investing
but also his life philosophies,

83
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:19,340
parenting. He is such a splendid
human being and has a very,

84
00:05:19,341 --> 00:05:20,750
very wide set of skills.

85
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:24,680
So I hope you enjoy this
conversation with Mike Maples.

86
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:28,163
Yeah,

87
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,950
thank you so much for coming everybody.
This is going to be great

88
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,120
and I'll read some suggested
introductory remarks. First,

89
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,470
thank you all for coming tonight.

90
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,380
Welcome to tonight's program with
Inforum at the Commonwealth club.

91
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:48,040
And what I'm not going to do is sit here
and regurgitate stuff that is already

92
00:05:48,921 --> 00:05:51,740
in the book that you just
bought cause that's very boring.

93
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:56,600
So what I thought I would do instead is
invite one of my friends who is in this

94
00:05:56,601 --> 00:06:01,010
book to join me on stage and to
dig into some of the old stories,

95
00:06:01,011 --> 00:06:05,600
the stuff you guys haven't heard and to
really just banter because he is one of

96
00:06:05,601 --> 00:06:08,690
my favorite people.
So who is this favorite person?

97
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:15,620
Kevin Rose is one of my favorite people
but he has a brand new human being to

98
00:06:15,621 --> 00:06:19,790
take care of. So he is not here to boost
it up with Ferris. I'm very sad to say

99
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:26,410
Mike maples junior can find them on
twitter@mtwojrfloodgate.com Mike maples

venture capital firm that specializes in

101
00:06:31,521 --> 00:06:33,260

102
00:06:33,261 --> 00:06:38,261
He's also the person
responsible for introducing me
to tech investing in general

103
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:40,760
and we go way,
way back.

104
00:06:40,761 --> 00:06:43,970
He has been on the Forbes Midas list
since 2010 and named one a fortune

105
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:47,210
magazine's eight rising stars before
becoming a full time investor.

106
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,430
This is very important.
Mike was an operator.

107
00:06:49,431 --> 00:06:52,310
He was involved as a founder and
operating executive at back to back.

108
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:54,560
Startup IPO is including Tivoli systems.

109
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:58,940
It's acquired by IBM motive IPO
motive acquired by Alcatel Lucent.

110
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:03,290
Some of Mike's investments include
Twitter, twitch dot. TV, Ng, Moco, Weebly,

111
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:07,430
check Bizaarvoice Spiceworks, Okta demand
for us and many, many, many others.

112
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:11,430
Please help me welcome to
the stage Mike Maples, right?

113
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:19,783
Yeah.

114
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,220
Thought we were just having a little
chat at like a bookstore or something.

115
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:29,420
I guess you tend to draw a crowd.
I keep forgetting that still. Yeah,

116
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,800
I was trying to

117
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,800
put us connecting on a timeline
and I think we've had a number of,

118
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:41,910
of interactions beginning
it had to be back pre 2000.

119
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:47,660
I think it, and I think when we
first started catching up, it was um,

120
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:53,200
the right before you had done the
four hour workweek and you were so,

121
00:07:53,301 --> 00:07:57,440
um, Tim, Tim wasn't sure what to call
this, but am I just anything goes,

122
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:01,670
anything goes, I may regret. But
yeah, so, so Tim and you know,

123
00:08:01,671 --> 00:08:05,190
I'm a little bit less over my
skis sometimes and Tim is, uh,

124
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,940
well it depends on the area
but w whatever. So, um,

125
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:12,550
but so Tim was deciding
whether to call the book, uh,

126
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:17,540
the four hour workweek or drug
dealing for fun and profit. And,

127
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:21,560
um, and I was like, Tim, why do you want
to write a book about being a Druggie?

128
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:23,810
You know, this is just terrible
idea. You know, you'd be,

129
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:28,250
it's just a terrible influence, just,
just a bad idea. And Tim was like, well,

130
00:08:28,251 --> 00:08:31,100
you know, you really want
to get people, you know,

131
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:35,780
sort of provoked the point of departure,
right to, to get access to the ideas.

132
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:40,700
And so we did this thing, I think we
called it ghetto testing where we said,

133
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:44,120
hey look, let's not argue, let's
not in your opinion versus mine.

134
00:08:44,121 --> 00:08:48,110
Let's just test the two
titles and just say, Hey,

135
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:51,980
by the four hour workweek, hey, by
drug dealing for fun and profit.

136
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:55,980
And you know, neither book exists yet.
So people would click on it and they get

137
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,960
a four o four error.
But we could,

138
00:08:57,961 --> 00:09:01,290
we could understand like
what got the better response.

139
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:04,650
And so now it was no longer your
opinion versus mine. It was just like,

140
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:08,850
what do people respond to?
So we did this.

141
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,450
That's my recollection. No, we had this
testing, but it goes even further back.

142
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:14,190
So you had appeared,

143
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:18,870
I was more of a spectator in a
class that I took in college,

144
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:22,650
like undergraduate back when
I had more hair on my head.

145
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:27,070
And Mike came to talk
about thunder lizards. Yes.

146
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:28,650
Which we'll talk about in a moment.

147
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,040
And that was part of what piqued
my interest in silicon valley,

148
00:09:34,621 --> 00:09:36,120
the bay area,
the excitement,

149
00:09:36,121 --> 00:09:41,100
certainly at the time 99 who granted
I was an exciting time to be running

150
00:09:41,101 --> 00:09:44,640
towards the precipice also.
Uh, but got me out here.

151
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:50,040
And then our conversations around the
time that the four hour work week came

152
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:54,960
out, uh, involved to my recollection,
many things. But we would sit at,

153
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:57,780
and I might be getting this
wrong, but hobbies, hobbies, yeah.

154
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:01,080
In town and country town,
which unfortunately no longer with us.

155
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:05,730
Have it on at Raster Darrow.
And we used to just eat omelets and uh,

156
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:08,160
and talk about marketing and PR,

157
00:10:08,161 --> 00:10:12,230
but also about the deals that you
were becoming involved with. Yeah.

158
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,900
And the, the testing for people
who don't know, it was very simple.

159
00:10:15,901 --> 00:10:20,610
I mean we had a number of different
titles and a used Google ad words,

160
00:10:20,611 --> 00:10:23,160
which was, I mean it was the
golden age of Google ad words.

161
00:10:23,161 --> 00:10:27,210
You could just shoot fish in a barrel. It
was so inexpensive. And so he took the,

162
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,940
the headlines prospective
headlines as the,

163
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:34,680
as the actual ad headlines and then the
perspective subtitles as the ad text and

164
00:10:34,681 --> 00:10:36,630
then had all these unique URLs that,
like you said,

165
00:10:36,631 --> 00:10:39,420
and went nowhere because all we really
cared about was the click through rate.

166
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,450
What I also did, if we want to talk
about businesses going out of business,

167
00:10:42,451 --> 00:10:47,130
there are a lot of them to point to is
I went to Palo Alto University AV to the

168
00:10:47,131 --> 00:10:50,790
borders that existed at the
time and to test covers.

169
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:54,960
I had mock ups that I printed out and I
would wrap a book that was roughly the

170
00:10:54,961 --> 00:10:55,501
same size.

171
00:10:55,501 --> 00:10:59,820
I thought mine would be put it up during
what I perceived to be rush hour at

172
00:10:59,821 --> 00:11:01,350
borders.
Not sure how I figured that out.

173
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:05,520
And I would say stand there like a
bouncer, keeping track of fire code,

174
00:11:05,521 --> 00:11:06,240
like click,

175
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,410
click watching the number of people
who picked it up like every 15 minutes.

176
00:11:09,411 --> 00:11:12,390
So I get, try to look at the
visual appeal of different covers.

177
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,940
Now it's a lot easier. You don't have
to quite do that. It's still this wine.

178
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:20,580
Oh yeah, I should, maybe I need some
booze up here and we'll get to that.

179
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,710
Uh,
but what I wanted to do,

180
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,830
so can I just interject one other thing
about these books should interject with

181
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,673
any other things.

182
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:31,320
So I went to Kepler's
bookstore and printers ink,

183
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,620
I guess, right, because they're,

184
00:11:32,621 --> 00:11:37,040
they're like well known as
bellwether bookstores and, uh,

185
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,950
and I was like, I'm going to, I went
and bought $1,000 worth of his book,

186
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,840
four hour work week at both bookstores.
And we didn't really know at the time,

187
00:11:45,841 --> 00:11:49,140
but bellwether bookstores
kind of trigger supply chains.

188
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,320
And so it's a little bit like before
the APP store happened, right.

189
00:11:52,321 --> 00:11:53,770
Cause the iPhone out yet.

190
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:57,340
And so, so like I'd go into
these bookstores and I'd be like,

191
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:59,230
how many copies do you
have in the bookstore?

192
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:02,500
I want to buy him all because this
book's going to be hot and I'm doing this

193
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:05,440
offsite and I need every copy you've got.

194
00:12:05,441 --> 00:12:08,950
Cause I doubt you have enough copies
for all people in this organization.

195
00:12:08,951 --> 00:12:13,750
I've run. And so it was just
me at the time. But, uh,

196
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:17,950
but like what it turned out it was true,
right? It like, it becomes, oh wow.

197
00:12:17,951 --> 00:12:19,530
Kepler's bookstore in printer's ink.

198
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:24,070
They're selling out like crazy as four
hour work week and that is the hot heat

199
00:12:24,071 --> 00:12:27,350
seeker on the New York Times. And then
more people read it too because up in the,

200
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:31,540
and obviously it was a good book
that helped, but uh, but it was like,

201
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:35,410
just looking back on it,
how, how crazy that was.

202
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:39,590
Cause I that like maybe you thought
it was gonna be this huge, uh,

203
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:42,250
breakout bestseller, but I
remember I was just like, Hey,

204
00:12:42,251 --> 00:12:46,840
I'll read these drafts blank however
I can. And like, I hope it works out.

205
00:12:46,841 --> 00:12:49,390
But yeah,
whatever it was.

206
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:54,260
I think you offered one of the very
first blurbs in the first edition of four

207
00:12:54,261 --> 00:12:57,730
hour workweek. Halftone read additional
copies. I go, okay, yeah. You're like,

208
00:12:57,731 --> 00:13:00,610
I ended up doing a quote too.
She was like, okay, I'll do one.

209
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:05,830
But when we're talking about
this alchemy for instance,

210
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:08,080
Kepler's let's just say,
unbeknownst to me,

211
00:13:08,081 --> 00:13:11,170
there's certain stores that trigger
certain other things and there's this

212
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,190
Mexican black magic, but there's
this, uh, these tipping points.

213
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:19,780
So now people look at what
you've accomplished and
the investments you've made

214
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:24,320
and the minus list and everything. And
it's, Oh my God, Mike maples sort of in,

215
00:13:24,321 --> 00:13:29,210
in quotation marks. But my
understanding is that, uh,

216
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:34,890
you had a tough time getting hired as
a venture capitalist when you first got

217
00:13:35,411 --> 00:13:38,980
here. Talk a little bit about that. You
know, it's like in a coach bill camp.

218
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:43,090
How many people have heard of Coachville
Campbell before a fair number? Uh,

219
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,550
and for those of you haven't,
I'll just give the quick version.

220
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:50,350
Bill was an early executive at apple and
then he ran a company called Claris and

221
00:13:50,351 --> 00:13:53,050
then go, which flamed out.
And then he was CEO of intuit,

222
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:58,090
but probably more significantly became
kind of the most famous coach in Silicon

223
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:01,030
Valley. He had been a football
coach before. He's a business guy.

224
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:05,710
And so he was on the board of Google and
apple and a actually I got a chance to

225
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:08,290
work with him and Twitter
and in a demand force,

226
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:12,550
which for two companies he got involved
with that we invested in. And um, uh,

227
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:16,690
Bill's favorite song was you can't
always get what you want by the rolling

228
00:14:16,691 --> 00:14:21,050
stones. And, uh, it always
struck me that, and I,

229
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,980
we won't do too much of
the book, but um, that,

230
00:14:23,981 --> 00:14:27,730
that sometimes you use the stuff you're
not getting right now that you think you

231
00:14:27,731 --> 00:14:29,830
want wasn't the thing you really wanted.

232
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:34,390
And so I couldn't get any venture firms
to hire me coming to silicon valley.

233
00:14:34,391 --> 00:14:38,500
I was just this random guy who'd moved
to Silicon Valley from Austin, Texas.

234
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:43,450
Never done an angel investment in my
life. And uh, you know, Kevin Rose,

235
00:14:43,451 --> 00:14:45,880
one of your favorite guys.
One of my favorites too.

236
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:51,160
I'm the first to bat entrepreneurs
I ever backed were Evan Williams,

237
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:55,500
uh, who ended up doing Twitter
and then Kevin Rose. And uh,

238
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,820
by the time I met Kevin,
no venture firm would hire me.

239
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:02,660
Nobody thought I knew consumer Internet
cause I was an enterprise software guy.

240
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:07,150
Nobody thought I knew how to invest.
And I was like, Kevin, look, I just, um,

241
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:10,940
I really need you to take my money
on this thing. And I, you know,

242
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:15,380
that's what we call a leverage open trade.
I'm afraid that I'm,

243
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,070
I'm going to have to go on hunger strike
in your apartment if you don't take my

244
00:15:19,071 --> 00:15:23,010
money in this dig deal.
And, um, you know, he,

245
00:15:23,011 --> 00:15:26,070
he ended up letting,
letting me, you know, uh,

246
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:29,580
Kevin and then Jay Adelson let me
invest and dig and uh, you know,

247
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:34,250
dig had a kind of a circuitous path,
but, um, you know, I look back on it.

248
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:39,320
Um,
that was the sort of the booster rocket.

249
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:43,130
Yeah. And uh, you know, it's funny.

250
00:15:43,131 --> 00:15:47,570
People talk about who back to
them or whatever. Um, you know,

251
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:52,180
I think that it, it was, uh,
Kevin's generosity that, uh,

252
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:57,290
sorta sorta got people I'd, sorry, get,
no, I get caught up with this stuff.

253
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,450
Sorry about that.
Yeah.

254
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:00,143
So,
uh,

255
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:06,370
so you and I share a similar
affection for the same guy. Yeah.

256
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,920
Kevin's a sweetheart of a guy. Yeah. Also,

257
00:16:09,921 --> 00:16:14,570
one goofy motherfucker is you guys know
I, well, you know more about this stuff.

258
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:17,150
I know more about, well,
we won't get into that,

259
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:21,950
but how do you connect with Kevin? I mean,
how did that meeting end up happening?

260
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:26,300
Well, it was a, Ron Conway
was really generous. So, um,

261
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:30,380
I heard about this guy named Ron Conway.
I reached out to him who,

262
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,920
I mean probably still, but it was
thought of as the godfather of fame,

263
00:16:33,921 --> 00:16:36,950
the most famous angel investor
of the world. Right. And so,

264
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,280
so we go to the oasis and,
and uh, was it the oasis?

265
00:16:40,281 --> 00:16:44,750
I care maybe the goose and uh, I
say, well, you're wrong. No, no.

266
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:49,480
A restaurant in Palo Alto
and Menlo Park knows,

267
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,820
I think it was the goose.
And, um, and, and so, so, uh,

268
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:57,650
so w Ron's like, hey, great
to meet you. And I said, Ron,

269
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,220
I just want one chance, just one
chance to work with you on one thing.

270
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:04,970
Just give me one chance. It's all I
need. And he's like, okay, whatever.

271
00:17:04,971 --> 00:17:08,150
You get your chance. What does
that mean? And I said, well,

272
00:17:08,151 --> 00:17:10,670
there's this company that
I'm interested in called dig.

273
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:13,670
Then I had to come up with my
own independent conviction about,

274
00:17:13,671 --> 00:17:17,260
but there's no way, like, how am I gonna
ever get in touch with Kevin Rose? Right?

275
00:17:17,261 --> 00:17:21,440
I'm just some random dude.
It's so, uh, so Ron's like,

276
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,990
he looks at his spreadsheet and he's like,
Oh yeah,

277
00:17:23,991 --> 00:17:27,710
I'm meeting with him next week. You want
to come with me to see dig? And I'm like,

278
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:30,700
sure, let's do it. And I
just knew there be, you know,

279
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:32,390
I knew what they were trying to do.
You know,

280
00:17:32,391 --> 00:17:34,720
I cared a lot about their
mission and you know,

281
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:38,660
I wasn't talking about things
like cohort analysis or you know,

282
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:42,350
well like what was the retention
and the decay factor of the users.

283
00:17:42,351 --> 00:17:43,184
It was more like,

284
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:47,210
you guys are transforming journalism
and this is like super important.

285
00:17:47,211 --> 00:17:50,430
And it's like the wisdom
of the crowds to stories.

286
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,500
And it's so like it was just,

287
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:57,120
I think that part of why Kevin gave me
a shot and Jay was that they just knew I

288
00:17:57,121 --> 00:18:01,050
just cared a lot about what they're
doing for my own reasons. Well,

289
00:18:01,051 --> 00:18:02,420
I think that from,

290
00:18:02,421 --> 00:18:06,990
from the opposite side of
the hubbies brunch table,

291
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:10,620
when I heard you talking about startups,

292
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:15,650
you are always genuinely personally
vested and excited about the products and

293
00:18:16,231 --> 00:18:21,231
you spent a lot of time not just looking
at the deal structure and the this and

294
00:18:21,421 --> 00:18:25,710
the that and the particulars of
whatever the projections might be.

295
00:18:25,711 --> 00:18:30,420
But the product itself and
knowing Kevin as well as I do now,

296
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:33,900
like I would see that as a key factor.

297
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:38,960
I mean also many other things to him
then gravitating to you in that way.

298
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:41,430
And I, when I think back
to our, our lunches,

299
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:45,360
we've talked about all these various
things and I would pepper Mike with all

300
00:18:45,361 --> 00:18:49,290
these questions like, wait, what's,
what's a claw back? What's a Pro Rad?

301
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:50,820
I don't know what that is.
What's this, what's that?

302
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,910
And eventually like any of it matters.
It's,

303
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,540
it's all blindfolded
monkeys throwing darts.

304
00:18:57,541 --> 00:19:01,410
But I really wanted to know how the best
blindfolded monkeys through the darts.

305
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:06,450
So we're digging into it.
And I remember at the time I was,

306
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,470
I was pretty brief.

307
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:13,260
This was before the four hour work week
popped because keep in mind that that

308
00:19:13,261 --> 00:19:17,550
book had initial initial print run in
between 10 and 12,000 copies, right?

309
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,370
I mean not even national distribution,

310
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,590
no one expected it to do
really much of anything.

311
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:28,100
And I was eager to take a little vacation
and I thought this two year vacation

312
00:19:29,191 --> 00:19:30,810
called an Mba might be interesting.

313
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:35,010
So I was looking at Stanford business
school and I made all these visits and

314
00:19:35,011 --> 00:19:37,920
there was some great classes.
One was taught by Pete Wendell,

315
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,930
a venture capital inside the trenches,
really great class by an operator.

316
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:45,720
But then there's all this theoretical
stuff that I just couldn't quite stomach.

317
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:50,880
And after, I don't know, four or five
of these lunches, I said, wait a second,

318
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:55,950
maybe I could put together a real
world MBA and make this, you know,

319
00:19:55,951 --> 00:20:00,951
Tim Ferriss Fund in principle and spent
120 grand over two years and learn all

320
00:20:01,381 --> 00:20:01,831
these things.

321
00:20:01,831 --> 00:20:05,070
And develop all these relationships
and view the 120 k's sunk costs,

322
00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:08,670
like that's gone. It's tuition,
but I don't know if you recall,

323
00:20:08,671 --> 00:20:11,100
but right off the bat,
what do I do?

324
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:15,120
So I asked Mike if he'd be
willing to let me piggyback on,

325
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:19,710
on a couple of deals to co-invest and be
really a sort of cheap labor to try to

326
00:20:19,711 --> 00:20:24,030
over deliver to these companies. And
uh, if you want to mention it, you can,

327
00:20:24,031 --> 00:20:27,270
but I'm not going to bring up the name of
the company, but they're, this company,

328
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,770
uh, that, uh, you, you, you were
very measured in, in assessing.

329
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:35,880
And he told me about it and it was super
popular I think in Taiwan or somewhere

330
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:39,090
and I got so over enthused.
I was like,

331
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:44,600
I want to put in 50 k now keep in mind
that's like 50 k of 60 for my first year.

332
00:20:45,181 --> 00:20:48,070
And in the first deal I want to do 59.
I remember you said to me at the time,

333
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:51,360
and you're very Mike way,
you said, well, well Tim, uh,

334
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,150
don't you think that might be a little
aggressive? And I was like, no man,

335
00:20:55,151 --> 00:20:59,650
this is going to be the next Google. And
then I just saw your like, okay. And then,

336
00:20:59,651 --> 00:21:03,040
uh, yeah, that didn't, that didn't,
uh, that, that forced me though.

337
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:07,630
If you want to talk about like life
saving you from what you want losing,

338
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:09,520
I mean it wasn't immediately lost.

339
00:21:09,521 --> 00:21:13,300
That's part of the tricky one
tricky aspect of the startup stuff.

340
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:17,080
It's like you might not have a clean
loss for many, many, many years.

341
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:21,160
I just might have like you
solve that quickly. Yeah.

342
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:24,310
So you might have a walking dead
scenario where it's just like,

343
00:21:24,311 --> 00:21:26,140
I am legend and you're
like, oh, now what do I do?

344
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,810
Kind of like certain areas in
SF past six o'clock anyway, so

345
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:37,280
I need more alcohol so I can excuse all
the things that I'm going to say. Uh,

346
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:40,300
where was I? Oh yes. So the,

347
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:45,350
the point was I had to then figure out
something called advising because I was

348
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,500
already out of money in year one.

349
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,640
And that led to in that period of time,

350
00:21:51,641 --> 00:21:55,150
a lot of the absolute best connections
that I made, including just to,

351
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:58,270
just to highlight something that comes
up over and over again in tribe of

352
00:21:58,271 --> 00:22:01,090
mentors. It comes up over and over
again in conversations with you.

353
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:07,550
There are these catastrophes or business
failures that really end up in no

354
00:22:08,621 --> 00:22:13,240
uncertain terms, sowing the seeds
of really huge leader success.

355
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:15,400
Right? Like you mentioned
the Securitas path of dig,

356
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:20,170
but who cares because you befriended and
became an ally of Kevin Rose who knows

357
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:24,760
everyone just about in tech and is very
generous with making introductions and

358
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:27,430
if he cares about you and believes in you,
he'll make those introductions.

359
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:28,600
Similarly,

360
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:33,600
I ended up at one point introduced
to Garrett Camp and I advise,

361
00:22:34,671 --> 00:22:38,080
Stumble upon, stumble
upon, didn't work out, uh,

362
00:22:38,081 --> 00:22:40,510
but we had a chance to
work together extensively.

363
00:22:40,511 --> 00:22:42,010
And then what a Garrett camp go on to do.

364
00:22:42,011 --> 00:22:46,000
He started this thing that people
laughed at called Uber Cab Llc,

365
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,970
which then got renamed.
It became Uber. Right?

366
00:22:48,971 --> 00:22:52,540
So that at least on paper
has worked out very well.

367
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,880
That's more important than clawbacks.
Yeah. More important than club. Uh,

368
00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:00,070
so first and foremost, thank you for, uh,

369
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:03,730
shepherding me even as a
viewer are a quick study,

370
00:23:03,731 --> 00:23:06,610
as much of a blunt instrument
as I was into all of that.

371
00:23:06,611 --> 00:23:10,810
But can you tell us about some of the
responses from the venture capitalists,

372
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:14,140
these rejections? Like what happened?
Can you tell us about a meat?

373
00:23:14,141 --> 00:23:17,230
You don't have to name names, but like,
you know, meetings go, I don't blame him.

374
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:21,940
I mean, uh, I had never made an angel
investment before I was from Austin,

375
00:23:21,941 --> 00:23:25,510
Texas. I had no network here.
I just show up saying, hey,

376
00:23:25,511 --> 00:23:29,460
I think I want to be a VC and,
um, you know, let's not a,

377
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:35,230
not a very straight
forward path. Um, and so,

378
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,750
you know, I would call up
sequoia capital and say, Hey,

379
00:23:37,751 --> 00:23:40,000
I'd like to interview for a job.
It's sequoia capital.

380
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:44,430
And that's just not how it really
works. And so, um, you know,

381
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:49,410
I have no animus towards
anybody. Like they probably, um,

382
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:50,600
you know,

383
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:55,310
they probably made the right decision at
the time for what their parameters were.

384
00:23:56,180 --> 00:24:00,830
See you have a characteristic,
it seems,

385
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:05,210
at least in the way you express yourself,
that I don't see in a lot of people.

386
00:24:05,211 --> 00:24:08,030
And that is, you seem to
hold very, very few grudges.

387
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:12,980
I don't think I've ever heard you
express ill will towards anyone.

388
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:15,500
Uh, especially in this day
and age. But that's a rarity.

389
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:19,460
Is that something that
you've always had by,

390
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:24,350
by birth or is that something
you developed? Why is
that? It's a waste of time.

391
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:29,240
But how did you learn that? How did
you embody this? Because if you,

392
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:30,083
uh,

393
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:34,220
I, I dunno, I Kinda, I kinda
look at it like life is short.

394
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,210
You don't have much time.
Every day is a gift. And the,

395
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:41,750
the part of the secret of happiness is
to figure out what your gift is and to

396
00:24:41,751 --> 00:24:46,751
offer it to the world and to like not
worry about all the noise and the hype

397
00:24:46,821 --> 00:24:48,740
around you that says what you should do.
You know,

398
00:24:48,741 --> 00:24:52,280
think for yourself and don't
waste any energy on this stuff.

399
00:24:52,281 --> 00:24:53,270
It doesn't matter to you.

400
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:58,780
And holding a grudge is a symptom of not
knowing how you want to spend the gift

401
00:24:59,661 --> 00:25:03,230
of today. And so, uh,
you know, it's hard to,

402
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:06,140
it's hard to hold a grudge if you're,
if you're so focused on,

403
00:25:06,141 --> 00:25:08,900
I'm excited about these things,
I can do a good job at this.

404
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:13,670
I can't wait to do this stuff. How do
you have time for grudges? It's just,

405
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:16,190
it just doesn't make sense.
Right. It doesn't make sense.

406
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,173
Yeah.

407
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:25,630
I mean, I, there was a few
people, you know, you know,
just be honest, but you know,

408
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:31,870
when she, you land in
Silicon Valley Sequoia, like,

409
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:35,050
and it wasn't just a quiet,
no, no. I don't know.

410
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:39,340
I probably shaped there and that's the
reason I'm just saying I'm singling them

411
00:25:39,341 --> 00:25:43,030
out because I was taking a fling at an
impossible dream. And Sequoia was like,

412
00:25:43,031 --> 00:25:44,110
Hey,
Harvard,

413
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:46,870
I want early acceptance to start and I
want to start in the middle of the year,

414
00:25:46,871 --> 00:25:49,720
even though I don't have the
prereqs. I mean, in a sense. Right.

415
00:25:49,721 --> 00:25:53,380
And I had no resume, no grades.
That's a hard pitch. Yeah. Uh,

416
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:56,210
and they're really good at what they
do. It turns out it was, yeah. Yeah.

417
00:25:56,730 --> 00:26:00,730
But you land here,
you don't get the jobs.

418
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:03,360
You are given this,

419
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:07,450
this gift of an introduction through
Ron with really smart wordsmithing.

420
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:10,480
Hope you guys were listening.
Like the pitch is really,

421
00:26:10,481 --> 00:26:14,500
really important and nuanced. You
ended up meeting Kevin Rose. So you,

422
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:19,540
you invest in Evan now at the time, was
it Twitter or was it, was Odo is podio?

423
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:23,500
So walk us through how that unfolded.

424
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:28,730
Well, um, I thought, you know, I was in
Austin and what I would do is, you know,

425
00:26:28,731 --> 00:26:33,470
my kids were in grade school and so
we weren't sure whether to move yet.

426
00:26:33,471 --> 00:26:36,800
So I would come out every Sunday
night and stay over Thursday.

427
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:39,680
And it's funny cause when you're
on that pattern on the plane,

428
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:43,410
some of the same people are on the plane,
like system integrator, consultants,

429
00:26:43,411 --> 00:26:46,360
people from Deloitte and stuff. And I'd
be like, oh, it's the brother that's,

430
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,700
hey bud, what's up?
What's going on? But, uh,

431
00:26:48,701 --> 00:26:53,310
so I'd be on these plane flights and all
these people and we would, um, we would,

432
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:57,420
uh, I did go from Monday to Thursday and
this is always dangerous when I got the

433
00:26:57,421 --> 00:27:00,490
bottle. Liquid courage.
Yeah. But, but, um, uh,

434
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,810
and so I thought, okay, I'm gonna,

435
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,930
I'm going to take nine months and figure
out if I can find something exciting

436
00:27:06,931 --> 00:27:09,900
and Silicon Valley.
So I just basically immigrated here.

437
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:15,230
And the reason that I did that was that
I thought the web was shifting from a,

438
00:27:15,721 --> 00:27:19,740
an internet of connected pages to a
platform that would connect people.

439
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:23,610
And it just felt like it was kind of time
to get the party started again on the

440
00:27:23,611 --> 00:27:25,620
Internet. You know, the bubble had burst,

441
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:29,520
the meltdown had happened
and I saw things happen.

442
00:27:29,521 --> 00:27:32,610
I saw Tim O'reilly talk
about web two auto,

443
00:27:32,611 --> 00:27:36,870
I saw stuff about podcasting and
broad catching and stuff like that.

444
00:27:36,871 --> 00:27:39,270
And I was like,
it's just clear to me,

445
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:43,200
this is just obvious that something major
news happening and I just have to go

446
00:27:43,201 --> 00:27:47,190
to California. I have to go right
now, not wait another day. And so,

447
00:27:47,191 --> 00:27:52,140
so I do that and as I've had the best
podcasting company and so I, you know,

448
00:27:52,141 --> 00:27:54,510
Jeff Huber it,
Google introduced me to him.

449
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:57,660
He said we just ran him off because he
doesn't want to work at a big company,

450
00:27:57,661 --> 00:28:00,250
but he's going to do something
interesting podcasting.

451
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:04,980
And Somehow Evan took my money his first
time ever since he took your money.

452
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,700
But walk us step by the way, that's
a pretty good start. And investing,

453
00:28:08,701 --> 00:28:12,150
that's a fantastic Williams did
Kevin Rose, it's not bad. You know,

454
00:28:12,151 --> 00:28:15,180
you could argue that the secret to
ventures to get lucky and your first five

455
00:28:15,181 --> 00:28:19,620
years, which I think is a pretty strong
argument, I think it's a huge argument,

456
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:23,880
but you, you've, you've since
then been like consistent,

457
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:27,710
I should correct me if I'm wrong,
but with Odeo there was a,

458
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:32,720
was there a point when as it was a very
good guy decided to offer investors the

459
00:28:35,281 --> 00:28:38,010
ability to, to get their money back? Yeah,

460
00:28:38,011 --> 00:28:41,790
so what happened was I'm so
invested in Odeo and Mike, okay,

461
00:28:41,791 --> 00:28:45,360
great best podcasting company,
first Angel Investment I've ever made.

462
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:48,180
Just wire the money in a week later,

463
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:51,630
apple decides they're going to
give away podcasting on iTunes.

464
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:54,300
And at the time,
it's hard to remember now,

465
00:28:54,301 --> 00:28:58,380
but 85% of all playback
devices where iPods. So like,

466
00:28:58,381 --> 00:29:02,160
what are we going to be the the, the one
you pay for on the Zune, right? Like,

467
00:29:02,161 --> 00:29:04,710
it's like, what business? Like
you don't have a business.

468
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:07,800
There's still people trying. It's so, so,

469
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:12,830
so a f to his credit tried for about
a year to figure out another business.

470
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,490
And um,
we couldn't,

471
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,190
and we'd go brainstorm and we'd look
at each other and we're like, yeah,

472
00:29:18,191 --> 00:29:21,120
it's pretty tough. And, and, uh, and um,

473
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:26,240
and so one day is some of the investors
were getting pretty disenchanted because

474
00:29:27,091 --> 00:29:30,330
they're like, you're just wasting our
money. You know, there's no business here.

475
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:35,130
And so f decides to give it
back to everybody. And so, uh,

476
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:38,310
so I'm like, look, have you
know, you don't owe me anything.

477
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:43,450
Venture capital is in the word has
venture in it and you win some,

478
00:29:43,451 --> 00:29:45,010
you lose some. Right? He goes,

479
00:29:45,011 --> 00:29:47,950
well this is the kind of the deal I've
struck with some of the bigger investors

480
00:29:47,951 --> 00:29:51,460
and B, it would help me a lot if you
just went along with it. And so I said,

481
00:29:51,461 --> 00:29:56,320
well as long as you let me invest
in your next thing. And he goes,

482
00:29:56,321 --> 00:30:00,220
well part of this deal is I get to keep
this Ip that I've been working on on the

483
00:30:00,221 --> 00:30:05,221
side and we're trying to decide whether
to call it voicemail 2.0 or tw TTR and

484
00:30:07,241 --> 00:30:11,440
it's one of Jack is working on it long
with Noah and we're figuring this out.

485
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,840
And I'm like,
what is,

486
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:16,500
I'm like come on voicemail 2.0 in like
why don't you put the vowels back in?

487
00:30:16,501 --> 00:30:20,260
Cause like Twitter without the vowel
sounds like flicker and that's derivative

488
00:30:20,261 --> 00:30:23,770
and whatever. So I don't think I had
anything to do with that by the way,

489
00:30:23,771 --> 00:30:28,230
but like I was just my gut
reaction. So he goes, ah,

490
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,590
you say what you're doing. And I'm
like, well then what? Ha. Okay. Yeah.

491
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,453
Then what happens?

492
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:38,470
He goes at 140 characters or less cause
we want it to do cell phones and stuff.

493
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:43,120
And I'm like, this is before the
iPhone, right? So, so I'm like, okay.

494
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:47,290
And then what happens? He's like, he's
like, that's it. That's all it does.

495
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:50,920
And I say, uh, uh, what's the roadmap?

496
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:55,510
There is no roadmap and a,
what's the revenue model?

497
00:30:55,900 --> 00:31:00,010
There is no revenue model.
And so I say a math,

498
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:05,080
uh, like, why do you even think this is a
product? Much less a business, a company.

499
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:08,590
And he goes, oh, I have no
idea if it is. But he goes,

500
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:11,230
here's the way I'm thinking about it.
Like blogger,

501
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:16,120
a million people use blogger software and
this is EBS. First company was blogger,

502
00:31:16,121 --> 00:31:20,080
he was one of the pioneers of blogging.
He goes, podcasting's kind of hard.

503
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,990
You had to use audio studio,
you had to record stuff,

504
00:31:22,991 --> 00:31:27,790
you had to put it on an RSS feed. He's
like, it just took more effort. He's like,

505
00:31:27,791 --> 00:31:32,791
what happens if you had micro blogs
and rather than a million people did

506
00:31:33,821 --> 00:31:37,090
microblogs 10 million people did.
Microblogs he's like,

507
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,240
I think if 10 million people
did microblogs the burden
of proof will be on the

508
00:31:40,241 --> 00:31:44,810
people who are negative. And so I
was like, sounds good to me. Uh,

509
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:48,910
I'd like to invest in Twitter or voicemail
2.0, whatever you call this thing.

510
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:54,460
And, uh, and he says, well,
it's, you know, it's not a
company. There is no investment.

511
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:59,890
But, uh, and then, and then a few months
later, uh, maybe six months later,

512
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:04,000
Twitter blows up at south by, which
is such a delicious irony, right?

513
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,880
Cause it's from Austin, right?
The town I just come from.

514
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:12,220
And a couple of weeks later, [inaudible]
says, hey. And I thought by then,

515
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,260
it's like a hot air balloon drifting away.

516
00:32:14,261 --> 00:32:15,990
There's no way I'm going to get to invest,
you know,

517
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,820
abs going to forgotten and
everybody's gonna be chasing him.

518
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:20,710
And he calls me up one day and says,
hey,

519
00:32:20,711 --> 00:32:25,150
did you mean it when you said you wanted
to invest in a Twitter? And I said, yeah.

520
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:26,980
And he goes, well, um,

521
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:30,670
we're about to take our first money and
if you want to do that, now's the time.

522
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:35,890
Wow. Yeah, that was a good
guy. He is. So like I,

523
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:40,090
I remember that because both of those
guys were good to me. You know, like

524
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:44,570
I just some random Joe Schmo
guy and both of them, uh,

525
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:48,970
you know, gave me a chance to be
involved in their companies and uh,

526
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:53,670
yeah,
that good guys and the RC,

527
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:58,340
I try to remember that every time an
entrepreneur pitches us. I, you know,

528
00:32:58,341 --> 00:33:00,260
I try to remember the
grace those guys showed me

529
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:06,860
and our stories intertwined in so many
ways because that I met him right around

530
00:33:06,861 --> 00:33:11,861
the time we were hanging out on this
book and 2007 South by southwest,

531
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:16,790
I begged and pleaded with Hugh Forrest
who was running south by interactive,

532
00:33:16,791 --> 00:33:20,070
or at least the programming
side still is, it still is. And,

533
00:33:20,071 --> 00:33:23,780
and now a neighbor of mine effectively.
And I begged and plead, I said,

534
00:33:23,781 --> 00:33:24,920
if you have any last minute,
can't,

535
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:28,160
I know you don't have any spots because
I've already been rejected multiple

536
00:33:28,161 --> 00:33:30,560
times.
But if you have a cancellation,

537
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:34,040
if there's anything that moves and
there's a spot, please let me know.

538
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,770
I'd love the opportunity.
And Lo and behold,

539
00:33:36,771 --> 00:33:40,880
there was this chance 2007 which at the
time to put it in perspective, Twitter,

540
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:45,590
all of the tweets in the world were
being displayed on these big screen TVs.

541
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:48,230
They were positioned
around the conference hall,

542
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:51,290
just one feed moving kind of slowly.
Every Twitter user,

543
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:55,910
I was briefly in the top 100 I was very
proud of that until Ashton Kutcher came

544
00:33:55,911 --> 00:33:59,360
along, just like kicked
my head around and I do,

545
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:03,980
I never cracked the top 100 donated,
only needed like 500 at one point.

546
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:07,520
And then it was gone. But it should have
been Mike at Twitter. But I was like,

547
00:34:07,521 --> 00:34:11,030
oh come on. Like how there are so many
people who have that story. They're like,

548
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:15,920
oh I just chose like Hawaii steak 5.0 is
my username cause who it's not going to

549
00:34:15,921 --> 00:34:18,290
become anything. And then again, I'm
stuck with that for the rest of my life.

550
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:23,990
But I ended up getting an
email from you and he's like,

551
00:34:23,991 --> 00:34:27,740
Hey, if you meant it, like we have an
overflow room that had a cancellation,

552
00:34:27,741 --> 00:34:31,540
a sponsor isn't going to do, they're
stuck. So if you want it 45 minutes,

553
00:34:31,541 --> 00:34:35,450
you blew up at south by
two. I did. And uh, it was,

554
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:40,990
what was really funny about it is I was
so nervous of sooner versus my first

555
00:34:41,211 --> 00:34:45,040
presentation really about the book.
And it was before the book came out.

556
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,510
The book came out in April,
2007. This was in March,

557
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,950
and I was staying at a friend's
place because I couldn't,

558
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:54,680
I wasn't gonna pay for the hotels. They're
all sold out. Also, if you get a room,

559
00:34:54,681 --> 00:34:56,930
and it's like $1,000 a
night during south by,

560
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:01,520
so I stayed in my friend's house and I
would go into his garage and I rehearsed

561
00:35:01,521 --> 00:35:06,380
my talk in front of his three Chihuahuas
and I'll explain, I'll explain why

562
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,570
a, my friend had other things to do and
he had real jobs so he wasn't going to be

563
00:35:11,571 --> 00:35:11,691
there.

564
00:35:11,691 --> 00:35:15,980
But the Chihuahua's you had to be at
least like 10% Tony Robbins to keep them

565
00:35:15,981 --> 00:35:20,270
engaged. And, and these
dogs at your secret,

566
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,970
is that your seat?
I can be 10% Tony Robbins.

567
00:35:22,971 --> 00:35:25,000
I'm doing pretty fewer in
tribe of mentors. Would you,

568
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:28,730
that would be your like talk like
it's saying, here's my district.

569
00:35:28,731 --> 00:35:32,720
My secret trick for networking is first
practice with dogs because they don't

570
00:35:32,721 --> 00:35:37,390
care about the content so much, but if
you're monotone they just kind of go, ah,

571
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,070
and then turn around

572
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:38,521
and walk away.

573
00:35:38,521 --> 00:35:42,000
So I was in the garage and I'm like kind
of doing this hand wavy stuff to keep

574
00:35:42,001 --> 00:35:44,820
them engaged. This, I
totally believe this. Oh No.

575
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:49,320
I remember the garage and then I go
to the event and I had all these fancy

576
00:35:49,321 --> 00:35:53,730
slides and everything prepared and
what happens? Blue screen of death,

577
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:57,030
my computer died and sell my,
okay,

578
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,760
well I guess I'm just going to have
to do this without any of my prompts.

579
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:04,680
And I did it, but I'd rehearsed so much
that I had it in my head. And uh, yeah.

580
00:36:04,681 --> 00:36:08,700
So Hugh also one of those
people, it's like, to this
day, if you ever asks me like,

581
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:11,820
Hey, could you help us with x, Y, Z,
go south pine? It's like, of course,

582
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:16,320
of course I will because it's
just like that one opportunity.

583
00:36:16,321 --> 00:36:19,050
And I also want to emphasize one thing.
He'll look and say, well, you know,

584
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,740
the luck was there with Twitter at the
same time and it was absolutely lucky.

585
00:36:22,741 --> 00:36:25,860
But it's like every year there
is something to draft on.

586
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,850
Like every month there's something like
that that you can draft and you just

587
00:36:29,851 --> 00:36:33,330
have to look for it, but you're going
to the other. Well the other thing is,

588
00:36:33,331 --> 00:36:36,300
it's kind of, I guess we talked
about grudges earlier. To me,

589
00:36:36,301 --> 00:36:41,190
like the opposite of having a grudge is
like to enjoy seeing somebody do well.

590
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,860
Right? And like, um,

591
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:47,340
when when I was a founder or you're
just trying to do real company stuff and

592
00:36:47,341 --> 00:36:48,990
make the company happen and you're like,
okay,

593
00:36:48,991 --> 00:36:51,270
we're going to go on this ride
and hopefully it works out.

594
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:55,920
But one of the fun things about being
an investor is you get to see people do

595
00:36:55,921 --> 00:37:00,030
well. You know, you get to see,
you know, like Logan and John, uh,

596
00:37:00,031 --> 00:37:04,140
from Lyft ate beans until
they raised their seed round.

597
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:07,380
And when we had our first board meeting
and looks at the financials and says,

598
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:11,310
you guys aren't paying yourselves and
minimum wage and that's illegal in

599
00:37:11,311 --> 00:37:15,810
California. It was like, we have to
fix that. And so, so like, and now,

600
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:19,950
now people talk about how much money
Lyft has and Al Carl Icahn's invested in

601
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:24,630
Google capital, but like, like I remember
him when they were eating beans. Right.

602
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:28,560
And, and, um, and it's just
fun to see them do that. Well,

603
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:32,110
it's fun to see you do this well,
right? I mean it's like, um,

604
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:36,360
we had no reason to think the four hour
work week was going to be that big a

605
00:37:36,361 --> 00:37:38,340
deal. I mean, you hope it will.

606
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:40,830
We a lot of reasons to believe it
wouldn't be a big deal. But I mean,

607
00:37:40,831 --> 00:37:43,680
it was like seven or just like
every time I see, you know,

608
00:37:43,681 --> 00:37:46,590
I'll get a call from somebody
like a reporter that says, Hey,

609
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:51,330
would you do a quote for this article
about Tim and some major publication.

610
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:55,650
I'm like, wow, he's just killing
it. That's awesome. Right?
And it's just fun to see.

611
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,480
It's a lot more fun to spend your energy
on deriving joy from that and seeing

612
00:38:00,481 --> 00:38:01,440
your friends do well,

613
00:38:01,441 --> 00:38:05,400
especially friends who were like worthy
of doing well and won't be changed by it.

614
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:09,240
Like that's a lot more fun than
remembering who wasn't nice along the way,

615
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:13,710
you know? Yeah. It's a drag. I've,
I've been working on the grudge piece.

616
00:38:13,711 --> 00:38:15,450
I don't have many, but
it's good to see you. Yeah,

617
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:17,940
I mean like the Arab spring
or like when I would,

618
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:21,830
I'd pick up Sloan on a play date,
you know, my daughter Sloan and,

619
00:38:21,831 --> 00:38:26,010
and the parents or the play date would
say, is it true you invested in Twitter?

620
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:30,900
I saw them on Oprah and then the
Arab spring happened and I was like,

621
00:38:30,901 --> 00:38:35,800
wow, this company is kind of working like
we got a chance to do well on this one.

622
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:39,970
You see, you mentioned
your daughter. I want to

623
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:45,610
bring up something that I've thought a
lot about since you mentioned it to me

624
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,950
and as context for folks.

625
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:52,951
What I've really tried to do in the last
at least five years is to look at the

626
00:38:54,821 --> 00:38:59,821
lives of people I look up to in a
holistic way before modeling them.

627
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,100
All right?
So what I mean by that is

628
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:09,690
it's tempting to look at say the business
success of person x and then replicate

629
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,014
everything they do.

630
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:16,410
But all you may see is one
tiny piece of the puzzle.

631
00:39:16,631 --> 00:39:20,990
And then in actuality they walk around
in shambles and every other capacities.

632
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:21,260
So I've,

633
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:25,870
I've tried with the interviews and the
books and tribe of mentors to really look

634
00:39:25,871 --> 00:39:28,180
at things holistically.
And I remember asking and I asked,

635
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,140
even though I don't have kids,

636
00:39:29,141 --> 00:39:33,580
I ask parenting advice of friends a lot
because I'm curious to see how they look

637
00:39:33,581 --> 00:39:33,880
at it.

638
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:38,290
And at one point I asked you when we were
on a hike and I asked you what advice

639
00:39:38,291 --> 00:39:41,860
you would give to a new parent or
someone thinking about becoming a parent.

640
00:39:41,861 --> 00:39:43,510
And please correct me if
I'm getting this wrong,

641
00:39:43,511 --> 00:39:46,030
but I might write your
version is going to be better.

642
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:49,210
But to my recollection,

643
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,360
there were two main points that you made
and there there could be more be you

644
00:39:52,361 --> 00:39:53,260
said,
number one,

645
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:59,430
really teach your kids and train them
to be optimists because without that

646
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:00,251
you're lost.

647
00:40:00,251 --> 00:40:05,251
And with that you can at least look for
a CE solutions and silver lining and so

648
00:40:05,771 --> 00:40:09,970
forth. And then the second part was
remember that your kids owe you nothing.

649
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,560
Like they didn't ask to be
born. You chose, remember, wow,

650
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:16,960
I do remember it was meaningful to me.
I really made an imprint.

651
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:20,980
And your job is to give them love.
It is not their job to give you love.

652
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:24,520
That's right. The, I chose to have
them, they didn't choose to have me.

653
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:27,160
They owe me nothing. Yeah. And, uh,

654
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:32,130
like I find it helpful to think
about that. But, but like the, the,

655
00:40:32,131 --> 00:40:36,670
the, the hope part I think
is, is important for them.

656
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:40,420
Like the, the, the way I
look at it is, unfortunately,

657
00:40:40,421 --> 00:40:43,210
unless we solve some breakthrough problem,
we're all going to die.

658
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:47,200
So you could choose to be to fetus
about that. Or you can choose to say,

659
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:52,360
the fact that we get to live at all
is just this huge gift. And so like,

660
00:40:52,361 --> 00:40:56,560
I think that one of the things that you
can do for your kids as you can help

661
00:40:56,561 --> 00:41:01,390
them feel optimistic and happy about
the fact that they have the gift to be

662
00:41:01,391 --> 00:41:04,180
alive and that,
um,

663
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,970
don't be defeatist about this world.

664
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:12,000
You had the gift of today and as
long as you have the gifted today,

665
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:17,110
like you should be like, you're,
you're on the path to the light. Right.

666
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:19,960
And, um, uh, and if you can,

667
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:23,860
if you can give your kids the gift of
being optimistic and hopeful about the

668
00:41:23,861 --> 00:41:27,070
future and grateful that they have
the time they're going to have, like,

669
00:41:27,071 --> 00:41:31,490
I think that that's helpful
for them because kids get,

670
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:34,040
they get judged and you know,
all of us

671
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:38,270
are unkind to ourselves in our own mind.
And we're judged by people all the time.

672
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:41,570
And it's easy to just forget
that just today's a gift.

673
00:41:41,571 --> 00:41:45,050
Be grateful for that gift to be optimistic
that tomorrow's gonna be another day

674
00:41:45,051 --> 00:41:49,460
where you have another gift. So when your
kids or say one of your entrepreneurs,

675
00:41:49,461 --> 00:41:53,880
I mean, yeah, startups are full
contact sport, right? I mean, yeah,

676
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:58,990
people take their lumps and in major
ways and bad things happen all the time.

677
00:41:59,590 --> 00:41:59,960
Uh,

678
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:04,960
whether it's with your kids or some of
the founders you've worked with when

679
00:42:05,001 --> 00:42:09,180
they're going through really rough time,
what do you, what do you say to them? Uh,

680
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:09,570
and it,

681
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:14,480
you could give a specific example
or just a general principle.

682
00:42:14,481 --> 00:42:19,370
Then I'd be curious to hear
how you'd think about that. Um,

683
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:22,870
well, so, so like these
founders that we've worked,

684
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:26,450
some of them are just
extraordinary, right? And so I, uh,

685
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:31,880
I'm reluctant to say we
had much of an impact. Um,

686
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:36,320
I think the thing that
sometimes I've done, uh,

687
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:41,150
that I've been proud of is
like when they're in the
depths of despair, you know,

688
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:46,040
entrepreneurship is like this where
there's no, there's no even path.

689
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:48,920
And, uh, there are times
where you just like,

690
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:53,030
everything is against you and you're just
like, how did I get myself into this?

691
00:42:53,031 --> 00:42:56,170
And this is so terrible. Uh, and, um,

692
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:00,500
I think I've been better than most
at those times. It kind of saying,

693
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:05,510
you've got this, how do
you, how, and sometimes,

694
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:07,250
and sometimes they need to hear that.

695
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:11,360
Is it just the words or how do you
deliver it? Like what makes no, I tell,

696
00:43:11,361 --> 00:43:15,080
I tell them, look, you know, Twitter,
we couldn't keep the servers running.

697
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:19,490
We couldn't decide who the CEO was.
A twitch,

698
00:43:19,491 --> 00:43:22,850
it was Justin TV.
We didn't even know what twitch was.

699
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:25,970
That's during the Chegg was
craigslist for colleges.

700
00:43:25,971 --> 00:43:28,220
And then Facebook decided
to compete with us.

701
00:43:28,221 --> 00:43:32,570
So we pivoted textbook rentals and
we only had 30 days left of cash.

702
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:35,480
And like Ng Moco,

703
00:43:35,481 --> 00:43:39,350
we had 45 days of cash when
we pivoted from APP downloads,

704
00:43:39,351 --> 00:43:44,090
the free to play and Lyft started out
as Zimride and when we launched Lyft,

705
00:43:44,091 --> 00:43:46,370
we weren't even sure it was legal.
So I'm like,

706
00:43:46,371 --> 00:43:51,050
guys like guys I've seen way
crazier than this. You got this.

707
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:54,920
And sometimes a founder needs to know,
look,

708
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,830
entrepreneurship on.
So I like,

709
00:43:57,831 --> 00:44:00,950
I like to say I like to invest in people
I would enjoy getting in trouble with

710
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:04,780
because it happens every time.
And um,

711
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:08,960
and like when you're in trouble with these
people, what's it going to feel like?

712
00:44:08,961 --> 00:44:11,420
Is it going to feel like, okay,
it's us against the world,

713
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:14,900
or is it going to feel like, oh, how did
I get myself involved with these people?

714
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:19,370
And so like, I like people where I'm
like, we're in the foxhole together,

715
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:23,120
screw the rest of the world and what
they think we're right. They're wrong,

716
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:28,380
let's rock and roll. Right. And
so, um, so that's kind of, uh,

717
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:32,400
I think that we've been like,
I like to say when I was an entrepreneur,

718
00:44:32,401 --> 00:44:34,950
one of the things I learned
is in my early customers,

719
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:38,220
they didn't just buy what I was selling,

720
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:43,200
they bought because they believed
what I believed we were in on a secret

721
00:44:43,201 --> 00:44:46,650
together.
And like when I work with founders,

722
00:44:46,651 --> 00:44:49,830
I like to say I'm in on a secret with the,
I believe they're secret.

723
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:53,160
And like we think the rest
of the world is just wrong.

724
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:57,030
We think we're right and we're going to
prove it. And so when stuff goes wrong,

725
00:44:57,031 --> 00:45:00,980
we're like, Eh, it's just a
setback, speed, bump, whatever. But,

726
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:05,730
but like in the end it's
like we still believe in our
insight. We're right. Let's,

727
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:07,680
let's prove it.
Let's prove it.

728
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:11,400
What about for yourself,

729
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:16,430
if you can think of in the
last decades could be anything,

730
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:17,940
but when,
when you,

731
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:21,060
could you give us an example of maybe a
tough time that you went through and how

732
00:45:21,061 --> 00:45:25,700
you found your way out of
it? Or what helped you find
way out of it could be any,

733
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:30,540
any set of life? Gosh, a fair number.

734
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:35,490
Um, you know, Liz, Liz and
I broke up, uh, you know,

735
00:45:35,491 --> 00:45:39,360
we'd been married for 17 years
and things didn't work out.

736
00:45:39,390 --> 00:45:42,510
And that just felt like, um, like,

737
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:47,220
like I had really failed as a person
and I was about to fail as a dad and,

738
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:51,150
you know, like, uh, what else? Uh,

739
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:55,620
what else was there if I failed at those
things and then what can I even think I

740
00:45:55,621 --> 00:45:59,370
was successful at? That was
a, that was a tough time.

741
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:04,830
Um, but, but, um, you
know, fortunately, uh,

742
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:09,510
kiddos turned out okay. And, um,
you know, I tried the hardest.

743
00:46:09,511 --> 00:46:13,410
I could navigate that time the
best I could. And, you know,

744
00:46:13,411 --> 00:46:17,880
kids turned out great and Liz and I
get along just fine and, you know,

745
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:21,150
you win some, you lose some.
But, but at that point in time,

746
00:46:21,151 --> 00:46:25,290
it just felt like everything I had done
in his life was screwed up and I just

747
00:46:25,291 --> 00:46:26,124
totally blown it.

748
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:31,530
How did you not just succumb to the
depths of despair and stay there?

749
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:35,030
Yeah. And some day, you know, we,

750
00:46:35,031 --> 00:46:36,880
we need to have some more
wine and talk about this,

751
00:46:36,881 --> 00:46:39,760
cause I know you've said that you've,
you've struggled right.

752
00:46:39,761 --> 00:46:43,650
At times with feeling depressed and um,

753
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:48,790
I'm like the worst person to talk to
depress people because I just don't

754
00:46:48,791 --> 00:46:52,540
understand the concept like, like a,
and it's like I'm not judging right.

755
00:46:52,541 --> 00:46:54,860
But like I'm, I'm just like, um, uh,

756
00:46:55,630 --> 00:47:00,630
today's a gift and like I have to like
make the most I can out of it and if it

757
00:47:00,971 --> 00:47:05,100
doesn't work out,
make the most out of [inaudible].

758
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:08,200
And by the way,
like I don't look at that like,

759
00:47:08,201 --> 00:47:11,320
I don't think that my way of thinking
is better than your way of thinking.

760
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:15,790
Like it's sort of like you're leaner
than I am. You could probably run faster,

761
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:19,230
jump higher. I don't sit there and
say, give me your legs. Right. I,

762
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:22,660
I just realized that we're all
different and I realized that,

763
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:26,710
that like I've had a few blessings in
life and one of them is to be grateful for

764
00:47:26,711 --> 00:47:30,430
every day. And, and like for
that to be the high order bit,

765
00:47:30,431 --> 00:47:34,630
no matter what's happening, I'm like,
you got to have today. So did that,

766
00:47:34,631 --> 00:47:38,350
was that just a life raft that you had
throughout that entire period that each

767
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:41,380
morning you'd remind yourself over? How
did it manifest on it's daily. It just,

768
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,680
it's just ever presence. Just
ever Pr. It's just obvious to me.

769
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:48,980
It's like breathing oxygen and I need to
borrow your code. All right. Yeah. But,

770
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:53,080
but I don't say that it's like, listen
to me and my advice, I'm so smart.

771
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:57,280
It's just I was lucky enough to
be configured in wired that way.

772
00:47:57,730 --> 00:48:00,730
So I want to make a suggestion
to everyone in the audience,

773
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,310
and this is based on observing
Mike over and over again.

774
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:07,810
When someone says to you, well,
you can explain it to me. I'm just,

775
00:48:07,890 --> 00:48:11,560
I'm a not a fast thinker. I'm from
Texas. When someone pulls that,

776
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:14,960
you should really be careful. And, uh,

777
00:48:15,010 --> 00:48:18,190
I actually borrowed that from you and
I was like, I think I can use this.

778
00:48:18,191 --> 00:48:21,820
Cause most people think people
from Long Island are idiots. Great.

779
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:24,480
So I'll be like, you know, explain
it to me again because I'm not clear.

780
00:48:24,550 --> 00:48:27,090
My brain doesn't move that fast and from
Long Island. And everyone's like, what?

781
00:48:27,190 --> 00:48:30,790
And then so thank you for allowing me to,

782
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:33,100
that I could help you act simple.

783
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:37,540
So I wanted to bring up,

784
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:41,260
and this is actually something
we have not spoken about

785
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:46,730
publicly or privately before,
but commander John Boyd. Yeah.

786
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:52,140
Can you explain who commander
John Boyd is and why you're a fan?

787
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:56,920
Yeah. So, um, uh, commander John Boyd was,

788
00:48:56,930 --> 00:49:00,280
I'm a flight instructor
for the Air Force and he,

789
00:49:00,281 --> 00:49:03,790
there was this expression that in
a simulated dog fight, he could,

790
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:08,850
he could beat any pilot in like 30 seconds
or some outrageously quick amount of

791
00:49:09,041 --> 00:49:12,580
time. And people were like, well,
how does he do that? And he taught,

792
00:49:12,910 --> 00:49:17,680
he taught this form of combat, which
was about moving very quickly. And,

793
00:49:17,681 --> 00:49:18,690
um,
uh,

794
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:23,710
so it's if you place yourself in the
time I was reading about John Boyd,

795
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:27,910
it was also when I was working
with Eric Reese and Steve Blank.

796
00:49:27,911 --> 00:49:31,540
And so Eric Reese was a
consultant at floodgate before
he wrote the lean startup.

797
00:49:31,541 --> 00:49:36,490
He's famous just like I have
this magnetism for famous
future to be authors I

798
00:49:36,491 --> 00:49:38,550
guess. But, but, uh, so we,

799
00:49:38,551 --> 00:49:41,740
we were talking to and we're like
something really important happening here.

800
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:45,250
Offshore Labor or search engine marketing,
opensource software,

801
00:49:45,251 --> 00:49:48,190
broadband penetration,
global markets.

802
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:51,340
And it seems like you can get a
product to market for less money.

803
00:49:51,341 --> 00:49:53,650
You can do it faster.
And uh,

804
00:49:53,710 --> 00:49:56,920
Steve Blank started talking
about this guy named John Boyd.

805
00:49:57,370 --> 00:50:01,000
And so John Boy does this
flight instructor in the
Air Force and he could beat

806
00:50:01,001 --> 00:50:02,810
anybody in a dog fight super fast.

807
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:08,250
And Boyd's fundamental insight was that
sometimes you can win a battle purely by

808
00:50:10,721 --> 00:50:12,340
being faster.
So like,

809
00:50:12,341 --> 00:50:17,020
let's say you're in a Russian Mig and
I'm in an f 16 and I make the wrong move,

810
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,150
but you haven't moved yet.

811
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:22,690
And then I make the right
moves before you've moved yet.

812
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:27,440
Just the mere fact that I was able to
make a move and course correct before made

813
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:30,290
your countermove means two things.

814
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:34,310
I can get in the right position
relative to you. But more importantly,

815
00:50:34,311 --> 00:50:38,030
it's very disorienting to you cause
you don't know where I am. I was here,

816
00:50:38,031 --> 00:50:40,150
now I'm there.
And so the,

817
00:50:40,151 --> 00:50:44,480
the philosophy of John boy
that was inspiring to me
back in 2005 and one of the

818
00:50:44,481 --> 00:50:46,460
reasons I started
floodgate was I was like,

819
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,670
you can do this as an
entrepreneur and an investor.

820
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:55,330
And so the f 16 fighter jet was designed
to John Boyd Spec and f 16 doesn't fly

821
00:50:57,111 --> 00:51:01,690
faster than Russian Mig, but it
changes directions faster. It's,

822
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:06,650
so the [inaudible] fighter was a system.
It wasn't just the plain,

823
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:08,540
which could change direction faster.

824
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:13,900
It was the mind of the pilot and the mind
of an agile pilot with an agile plane

825
00:51:14,330 --> 00:51:19,190
will be to mush, beat a Russian
Mig all day long. And so, um,

826
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,920
so I was like, that's what's
going to happen with startups.

827
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:26,600
And that's why 500,000 is the new 5
million. And that's why we need to go fun,

828
00:51:26,601 --> 00:51:28,100
these agile entrepreneurs,

829
00:51:28,101 --> 00:51:32,750
because they're going to be able to
force multiply and the big competitors

830
00:51:32,751 --> 00:51:36,500
who've raised a bunch of money or going
slower doing waterfall development,

831
00:51:37,070 --> 00:51:41,120
they're going to be disoriented by
how fast these companies move. And so,

832
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:42,520
like what,
what,

833
00:51:42,530 --> 00:51:47,530
what I really learned from Boyd was
the kind of this idea that if you,

834
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:51,950
if you are a speed based competitor,
uh,

835
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:55,520
you can be wrong but still be right
quicker, which makes you, right,

836
00:51:56,930 --> 00:51:57,650
right?
Which,

837
00:51:57,650 --> 00:52:02,650
which translates very directly to
blank and Eric Reese and that's right.

838
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:05,090
Minimum buyable product and iterating.
You could,

839
00:52:05,091 --> 00:52:06,560
you could be totally off
base in the beginning,

840
00:52:06,561 --> 00:52:11,530
which a lot of your biggest hits have
been in the 93% of our exit profits have

841
00:52:11,531 --> 00:52:15,770
come from pivots. And so, you know,
you look at that and you say, Gosh,

842
00:52:15,771 --> 00:52:19,390
when we invest, should we even
care what the business is? I mean,

843
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:24,050
it's a legitimate question.
So like cruise automation,

844
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:29,300
right? That's one of our recent wins.
Uh, you know, Kyle had started twitch,

845
00:52:29,330 --> 00:52:33,860
we made a bunch of money on twitch and uh,
he starts this company called cruise.

846
00:52:33,861 --> 00:52:37,880
It's like a roof rack that does
autopilot self driving. I'm like, Kyle,

847
00:52:37,881 --> 00:52:41,300
that's a bad idea because you're going
to live 20 customers in the world.

848
00:52:41,330 --> 00:52:45,200
There's only 20 car companies that
matter and they have concentrated buying

849
00:52:45,201 --> 00:52:48,290
power and they can design you out unless
you're like 10 times better and there's

850
00:52:48,291 --> 00:52:52,070
gonna be competition, blah, blah, blah.
So six months later he's like, okay,

851
00:52:52,071 --> 00:52:55,520
you're right. The roof rack idea was
dumb. I've got this new idea. I'm like,

852
00:52:55,521 --> 00:52:59,720
what's your new idea? Is like, I'm
going to make Nissan leafs self driving.

853
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,990
And I'm like, then why are you
gonna do? He's like, well, you know,

854
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:05,720
there's a lot of ways you can monetize
that. You can do a fleet of cars,

855
00:53:05,721 --> 00:53:08,540
you can sell the cars people
you do. So I'm like, okay,

856
00:53:08,541 --> 00:53:09,540
let me get this straight column.

857
00:53:09,550 --> 00:53:12,010
Now you're just going to
compete against everybody there.

858
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:16,850
You compete against Uber and Lyft
and Tesla and GM and everybody, Bosh.

859
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:20,120
He's like, yeah, but you know,
I'm passionate about this.

860
00:53:20,121 --> 00:53:24,170
I've been doing this since MIT is
my research project. And I've just,

861
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:25,770
I just think this the way to go.

862
00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:29,040
And I sat there and I thought
about it and I was like, you know,

863
00:53:29,070 --> 00:53:34,070
this guy made me 84 times on my
money last time I wrote him a check,

864
00:53:34,890 --> 00:53:39,060
I think I'm just going to run
them in check. So, uh, so I,

865
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:42,600
so I go to the partner meeting at
floodgate and thank God you don't have,

866
00:53:42,630 --> 00:53:46,020
we don't have a voting system.
And I say, I say, you know,

867
00:53:46,021 --> 00:53:48,060
I think I've decided I'm
going to do this cruise deal.

868
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:52,560
And everybody reads me the riot act
and they're like, Mike, come on.

869
00:53:52,590 --> 00:53:56,220
Like I understand that a
business model can be vague,

870
00:53:56,580 --> 00:54:01,580
but like you cannot even articulate a
path where this is a business and neither

871
00:54:01,951 --> 00:54:06,090
can Kyle. And I was like,
no, but you don't understand.
And he's an awesome founder.

872
00:54:06,110 --> 00:54:08,820
He's got incredible insights, he's
very passionate, blah, blah blah.

873
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:13,440
So like everybody just is like, talk
to the hand, this is stupid, whatever.

874
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:18,570
So we had two new, uh, venture partners
who became partners, Ryan and Arjun.

875
00:54:18,571 --> 00:54:23,010
And six months later they get bought by
GM for more than a billion dollars. And,

876
00:54:23,011 --> 00:54:25,770
um, Ryan and Arjun go,
boy, it's really a shame.

877
00:54:25,771 --> 00:54:30,690
We talked you out of this cruise deal.
And I said, oh, we funded crews. And

878
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:34,630
so, uh, like of course we funded it.

879
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:38,670
I secretly have super voting rights on
every deal. No, we, it at floodgate,

880
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:42,750
there's no voting system.
It's just somebody has to pound the table.

881
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,940
And so if somebody pounds
the table and says,

882
00:54:44,970 --> 00:54:49,080
I will take ownership of this and I
am responsible for the outcome of our

883
00:54:49,081 --> 00:54:53,940
returns to deal happens. But if everybody
around the tables and a minus and says,

884
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:58,260
I think this is a good deal for you to do,
Tim or you to do an or you to do,

885
00:54:58,261 --> 00:55:01,860
Ryan are you to do origin.
But nobody says I will pound the table.

886
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:06,300
I'm irrationally love with this
doesn't happen. So like we, you know,

887
00:55:06,301 --> 00:55:09,600
we kind of think that in the super
early stage, kind of love conquers all.

888
00:55:09,870 --> 00:55:12,980
And it's like, you know, when you're
going through all these times are good,

889
00:55:12,981 --> 00:55:14,220
getting all his trouble.

890
00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:18,540
It's your love for the idea
and the founder that will
cause you to like overcome

891
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:19,830
whatever you face.

892
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:23,490
And you have to have enough authentic
love and passion for the idea and the

893
00:55:23,491 --> 00:55:27,780
founders that you're willing to pound
the table and say, I will defend this.

894
00:55:27,930 --> 00:55:30,270
I will defend 140 characters or less,

895
00:55:30,450 --> 00:55:34,440
even though people say
it's stupid in 2007 right.

896
00:55:34,890 --> 00:55:38,040
So just need,
you just need one person who is,

897
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:43,440
who in some cases irrationally exuberant
and willing to defend the idea for a go

898
00:55:43,921 --> 00:55:48,840
signal for sure. And then, uh, so this
is, this is really fascinating to me.

899
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:51,990
Yeah. We're not exactly a
private equity shop. No,

900
00:55:51,991 --> 00:55:56,991
but it strikes me that some of
the best investors I know have a,

901
00:55:58,180 --> 00:56:01,140
a similar or close
cousin approach to that.

902
00:56:01,141 --> 00:56:04,650
Like if they have somebody who's
willing to just put it all on the line,

903
00:56:04,950 --> 00:56:09,030
who's already been vetted because they
were hired as a partner, it's like, okay,

904
00:56:09,031 --> 00:56:12,690
kid, like it's on you then. No. But
if they're really willing to go,

905
00:56:13,410 --> 00:56:17,390
go to go to fight for it. And, and by the
way, like if you're a partner, floodgate,

906
00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:20,460
yeah, you pound the table. But guess
what? We keep track of the deals you did.

907
00:56:20,461 --> 00:56:24,370
And if you like lose tens of
millions of dollars of no returns.

908
00:56:24,970 --> 00:56:28,680
It's nothing personal, but like you
just don't seem to be cut out for this.

909
00:56:28,681 --> 00:56:30,250
You're not like pound our table anymore.

910
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:32,740
So like when I pound the table for a deal,

911
00:56:32,741 --> 00:56:37,600
I know just as much as any other partner
that I am taking ownership of pounding

912
00:56:37,601 --> 00:56:40,270
the table and we're going to all help
each other and we're not going to say,

913
00:56:40,271 --> 00:56:43,600
yeah, I told you so. But it's
like if I pound the table,

914
00:56:43,601 --> 00:56:48,370
I'm saying I care enough about this
idea that I'm willing to have some of my

915
00:56:48,371 --> 00:56:51,070
track record and
credibility be tied to this.

916
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:55,900
How do you differentiate? If
you look at, for instance,

917
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:59,430
93% of the returns coming from
companies that pivoted. Yeah.

918
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:05,700
When you are observing a founder or trying
to help and just by way of giving the

919
00:57:06,521 --> 00:57:09,310
most convoluted question possible.
Okay.

920
00:57:10,090 --> 00:57:13,210
Question I get a lot is how do I
know when to persist with my idea?

921
00:57:13,870 --> 00:57:15,940
How do I know when to quit or
how do I know when to pivot?

922
00:57:16,030 --> 00:57:17,470
That's a hard question to answer.

923
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:21,940
But when I spoke with Marc
Andreessen awhile while back
for the podcast, he said,

924
00:57:21,941 --> 00:57:25,120
you know, sometimes people pivot so
often. It's like every time I see them,

925
00:57:25,121 --> 00:57:27,500
I'm paraphrasing here, it's like
watching a rabbit good down in a maze.

926
00:57:27,770 --> 00:57:31,000
It's like every two days
it's a different company.

927
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:34,990
It's like they think it's a Mulligan,
not a pivot. Right? So how do you,

928
00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:39,650
how do you help guide or even assess a,

929
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:45,010
a good pivot versus someone
who's merely unfocused? Yeah.

930
00:57:45,011 --> 00:57:47,410
So, um, uh, and, and you know,

931
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:52,360
it could be that I've just been had
a string of crazy beginner's luck.

932
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:57,310
And so that is a very real potential
factor. Yeah. But, but, um,

933
00:57:57,430 --> 00:57:59,910
uh, the way I see it is that, uh,

934
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:03,310
you are right when,

935
00:58:03,490 --> 00:58:06,070
when not because people agree with you,

936
00:58:06,510 --> 00:58:10,480
you are right or wrong based on whether
you're first principles thinking is

937
00:58:10,481 --> 00:58:15,370
right or wrong. And so if I see
a company where it's not working,

938
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:20,110
but I still believe in the first
principles of the idea, I say,

939
00:58:20,111 --> 00:58:20,944
this is great.

940
00:58:21,610 --> 00:58:24,850
We still believe in the first principles
and we know more than we knew a year

941
00:58:24,850 --> 00:58:26,920
ago.
That's a fundamental advantage.

942
00:58:27,490 --> 00:58:32,430
Like why would we want not want to double
down on that? And so, uh, whereas what,

943
00:58:32,431 --> 00:58:35,380
what happens too often as you say,
this doesn't work,

944
00:58:35,381 --> 00:58:39,010
it doesn't have traction and we're not
gonna be able to raise money, you know,

945
00:58:39,550 --> 00:58:40,390
forget about it.

946
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:44,710
And the problem with that is that if you
live with the results of other people's

947
00:58:44,711 --> 00:58:49,270
thinking, it's, it's like if
somebody really smart like fight,

948
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:52,750
you know,
I guess if Reid Hoffman says to me,

949
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:55,420
this is a bad network effects idea,

950
00:58:55,421 --> 00:59:00,400
because if it doesn't conform to network
theory in these ways, unlike, okay,

951
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,270
that's data. He's the smartest
network effects guy. No,

952
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:08,260
the best PR first principles thinker
about network effects. I know.

953
00:59:08,650 --> 00:59:11,860
And I offered a first
principle to him that he said,

954
00:59:11,861 --> 00:59:16,240
you're wrong on first principles. I'm
like, hm, I pry all listen to that.

955
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:19,120
Uh,
but like if somebody like with Chegg,

956
00:59:19,121 --> 00:59:21,350
right when we did textbook
rouse people said, oh,

957
00:59:21,351 --> 00:59:25,430
people try that before with varsity books.
And like,

958
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,470
who gives a shit? That was five years
ago, like five years ago, isn't it today?

959
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:35,690
And so like, um, like to me
it's about like what are,

960
00:59:35,691 --> 00:59:37,640
what are just your first principles,

961
00:59:37,641 --> 00:59:42,620
reasoning behind why you're excited
about something and are your first

962
00:59:42,621 --> 00:59:46,370
principles,
reasons being refuted or double down on.

963
00:59:46,730 --> 00:59:50,870
Because to me the valid definition of a
pivot is the first principles are still

964
00:59:50,871 --> 00:59:51,704
true,

965
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:55,670
but you learned something from the data
on the ground that caused you to double

966
00:59:55,671 --> 01:00:00,440
down on a new aspect of that that nobody
else knows God and see have in Split.

967
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:05,060
But like that may just me be giving a
good explanation for why I got lucky.

968
01:00:05,190 --> 01:00:09,170
That is perfectly reasonable point
of view for you to take. Yeah,

969
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:12,620
I mean it's certainly possible.
Uh,

970
01:00:12,950 --> 01:00:16,940
I would tend to assess it as
certainly a component of skill.

971
01:00:16,941 --> 01:00:20,150
But if you're looking at then let's
just take you of the first principles.

972
01:00:20,151 --> 01:00:21,350
Maybe then you have strategy,

973
01:00:21,351 --> 01:00:23,960
then you have tactics and you have
tools you could look at a stack.

974
01:00:25,850 --> 01:00:30,830
Are the first principles in your
investing experience? Mostly spotting,

975
01:00:30,831 --> 01:00:34,620
say converging trends that people
haven't spotted before. What,

976
01:00:34,621 --> 01:00:39,230
what would be an example of first
principles as it applies to one of these?

977
01:00:39,490 --> 01:00:44,020
Will you surf? Do you surf poorly?
Orally I surf even more poorly but,

978
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:48,650
but like I like the Metaphor of surfing
because you could be a skilled surfer

979
01:00:49,010 --> 01:00:51,020
but you don't really control surfing,
right?

980
01:00:51,021 --> 01:00:55,130
You can sort of control the board ish.
Even if you're good,

981
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:58,940
you can only barely control it,
but you can't control the wave.

982
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:03,590
And like I look at the w to me the magic
that animates the tech industry is a

983
01:01:03,591 --> 01:01:05,420
combination of Moore's law,
Metcalf's law.

984
01:01:05,690 --> 01:01:10,610
And so I think we all benefit from the
magic of Moore's law Metcalf's law and

985
01:01:10,611 --> 01:01:15,470
it's like literally as powerful as the
ocean waves and below you when you surf.

986
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:20,780
And so like I look at it like the job
of a startup founder is to surf a valid

987
01:01:20,781 --> 01:01:24,380
wave and the wave is usually
bigger than the company, right?

988
01:01:24,381 --> 01:01:26,480
Like when we invest in Lyft and crews,

989
01:01:26,810 --> 01:01:31,730
we had this belief that network capitalism
is supplanting vertically integrated

990
01:01:31,731 --> 01:01:35,390
corporations and that there would be
network transportation and just like I

991
01:01:35,391 --> 01:01:37,880
believe there's going to be networked
real estate network manufacturing,

992
01:01:37,881 --> 01:01:38,714
all this stuff.

993
01:01:38,930 --> 01:01:43,070
And so we believe that those gathering
waves are more powerful than any one

994
01:01:43,071 --> 01:01:44,780
company. And that the, the,

995
01:01:44,781 --> 01:01:49,781
the job of the tech entrepreneur is to
leverage the awesome massive power of all

996
01:01:51,801 --> 01:01:52,930
of the,
you know,

997
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:57,500
all of the fury of the ocean beneath them
of Moore's law and Metcalf's law just

998
01:01:57,501 --> 01:02:01,910
surf into the beach and you know,
like give Moore's law enough time,

999
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:07,480
it will breach the advantage
of any incumbent and give
Metcalf's law enough time

1000
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:10,610
and it will create an insurmountable mote.

1001
01:02:10,790 --> 01:02:13,520
Google tried to take out
Twitter with Jaiku didn't work.

1002
01:02:13,910 --> 01:02:15,110
It didn't matter because Twitter,

1003
01:02:15,111 --> 01:02:20,111
I had a network effect and so like to
me like the tech industry's magical,

1004
01:02:20,551 --> 01:02:22,530
like there's been tulips in the past.

1005
01:02:22,531 --> 01:02:25,860
There's been a crash of 29 there's
been the real estate bubble,

1006
01:02:25,861 --> 01:02:28,110
there's bubbles all the time.
There's mania is all the time,

1007
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:33,620
but tech is animated by two
valid exponential forces
that are super powerful and

1008
01:02:33,751 --> 01:02:37,050
they are the asymmetric attack vector
of the entrepreneur. They are the,

1009
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:41,580
they're the Rock in David's slingshot.
And so,

1010
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:42,473
uh,

1011
01:02:42,810 --> 01:02:47,810
I look for founders who have some type
of fundamental contrarian insight about

1012
01:02:48,151 --> 01:02:53,010
where a wave's about to gather and then
hopefully they have the stuff to surf it.

1013
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:57,180
And if they do, I'm like, hey, let's
raw unconditional love. Let's go.

1014
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:02,400
Will you, you gave me some
related advice really early on.

1015
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:05,030
I remember meeting more by
the way. Any more wine? Yeah.

1016
01:03:05,070 --> 01:03:08,400
Think I think I have a wine deficiency.
Yes. We'd love to see out wine. Gotcha.

1017
01:03:08,730 --> 01:03:10,680
Thank you.
You gave me some advice.

1018
01:03:10,681 --> 01:03:14,970
I remember it was at a restaurant
in Palo Alto. There was, uh,

1019
01:03:15,030 --> 01:03:18,420
an event gathering.
Reid Hoffman was speaking,

1020
01:03:18,450 --> 01:03:22,680
I was attending and we were having wine
much like we're having right now. And we,

1021
01:03:22,681 --> 01:03:26,460
you're talking about some
deal I was flummoxed by,

1022
01:03:26,490 --> 01:03:31,490
because I had certain primitive
parameters for investing and I was getting

1023
01:03:31,741 --> 01:03:35,070
somewhat ridiculed for my
simplistic parameters. Like,

1024
01:03:35,340 --> 01:03:38,430
I need to be a power user of the product.
I need to,

1025
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:42,090
it needs to match with the demographic,
that sort of core audience than I have.

1026
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:47,460
And I got a lot of flack for it. And I
remember he said to me, well if those are,

1027
01:03:47,461 --> 01:03:49,020
say you didn't use these words then,

1028
01:03:49,021 --> 01:03:53,150
but like your first principles as are
your sort of criteria. If you fall,

1029
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:54,390
you're going to make,

1030
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:58,920
in some cases really good investments
when people are poopooing the idea,

1031
01:03:58,921 --> 01:04:03,030
but it perfectly matches.
So your criteria when it's,

1032
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:06,930
when their sprints, right, based
on first principles. Conversely,

1033
01:04:06,931 --> 01:04:10,470
if it doesn't match your first principles
and you're getting into a deal because

1034
01:04:10,471 --> 01:04:13,230
it's closing tomorrow, but we can
feel it, you feel or whatever,

1035
01:04:13,410 --> 01:04:16,800
if you're just following some consensus,
however small,

1036
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:18,690
but it doesn't conform
to your first principles,

1037
01:04:18,691 --> 01:04:19,680
that's where you gonna lose your money.
Yeah.

1038
01:04:19,681 --> 01:04:21,900
This is where like people
talk about social proof.

1039
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:26,220
I think social proof is
bullshit. I think that it's, um,

1040
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:31,110
so my favorite example is
actually an Elon Musk example. So,

1041
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:34,170
I don't know if some of you may have
heard this, but I thought you can say,

1042
01:04:34,180 --> 01:04:38,910
I think some of you may have heard
of him. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, so,

1043
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:39,890
so,
um,

1044
01:04:40,290 --> 01:04:44,670
he talks about space x and most people
think space x is like a better NASA,

1045
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,510
but that's not true. So you
think about a rocket, um,

1046
01:04:48,570 --> 01:04:53,570
what 0.3% of the cost of the rocket is
the fuel and the rest of it is what gets

1047
01:04:54,061 --> 01:04:58,500
burned up in space when it doesn't
come back. So Ilan says, okay,

1048
01:04:58,770 --> 01:05:01,820
if you could have a reusable
rocket you could have,

1049
01:05:01,860 --> 01:05:06,780
you could maintain 99.7% of the value
of the rocket by bringing it back to

1050
01:05:06,781 --> 01:05:09,030
Earth.
And if you could do that,

1051
01:05:09,031 --> 01:05:11,640
you could have a two orders
of magnitude improvement.

1052
01:05:11,690 --> 01:05:16,110
The economics of space travel,
that's first principles thinking.

1053
01:05:16,410 --> 01:05:21,040
Or when f says if 10 million people,
right? Microblogs that's 10 times more.

1054
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:24,310
The burden of proof is on the people
that are negative. And so like,

1055
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:28,840
I don't have to see the
business plan to say,

1056
01:05:28,930 --> 01:05:33,230
that's an insight I can
get behind. Right. Uh,

1057
01:05:33,310 --> 01:05:37,540
conversely all see plenty of business
plans that look incredibly straightforward

1058
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:42,340
and I eliminate them immediately because
they're just not an exponential enough

1059
01:05:42,341 --> 01:05:46,290
and they're not first principles enough
in my whole business isn't about how,

1060
01:05:46,310 --> 01:05:50,290
how often I lose. It's the magnitude
of the rightness when I win.

1061
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:55,240
And so like I, when I, when I
have to win super freaking big,

1062
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:59,440
this is a such an important point. And
because it applies to life and not just,

1063
01:06:00,130 --> 01:06:03,270
well it depends. Like if you're a PE
guy, you don't want to have anybody,

1064
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:05,170
you don't want more than private equity.

1065
01:06:05,171 --> 01:06:09,640
You don't want to have more than like a
15% loss ratio. Sure. So you're, you're,

1066
01:06:09,670 --> 01:06:13,620
you want to take out risk and you want,
but I'm not a risk taker outer,

1067
01:06:13,630 --> 01:06:15,880
I'm a luck multiplier,
right?

1068
01:06:15,910 --> 01:06:19,960
Like I'm not asking what
can go wrong because I'm
investing when it's worth zero,

1069
01:06:20,410 --> 01:06:23,410
I'm asking what could go spectacularly,
right.

1070
01:06:23,470 --> 01:06:28,470
Is a rare event and I only have to
be right a fair number of times.

1071
01:06:29,290 --> 01:06:34,290
As long as the idea has the exponential
awesome power to just take us to the

1072
01:06:35,051 --> 01:06:36,580
promised land.
Well,

1073
01:06:36,630 --> 01:06:40,990
this is part of what appealed to me about
the startup game as you explained it

1074
01:06:40,991 --> 01:06:45,700
to me,
because it's a hits driven business.

1075
01:06:46,030 --> 01:06:47,530
You can be wrong a lot,

1076
01:06:47,590 --> 01:06:52,590
but if you have decent rules
that have some basis in reality,

1077
01:06:53,020 --> 01:06:57,400
maybe you, maybe, maybe then you,

1078
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:59,440
as long as you're,
this is,

1079
01:06:59,441 --> 01:07:01,870
we don't have to get into like
portfolio theory and stuff, but yeah,

1080
01:07:02,260 --> 01:07:06,520
as long as you're investing enough in
these bets that they can say return the

1081
01:07:06,521 --> 01:07:11,070
fund or whatever the parameters might
be, it's a, it's a fun game. Uh,

1082
01:07:11,140 --> 01:07:13,450
and uh,
it's certainly dangerous one.

1083
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:17,280
But let me ask you this because I remember
how impactful and then we're going to

1084
01:07:17,281 --> 01:07:21,690
go to audience Q and a. My, in my,
my, my pink basket that I brought,

1085
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:26,680
uh, if you are teaching,
you can pick the age.

1086
01:07:26,710 --> 01:07:30,430
It could be college, freshmen,
college, senior of high school, senior,

1087
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:32,290
doesn't really matter.
Graduate School,

1088
01:07:32,770 --> 01:07:35,080
if you were teaching a
class on entrepreneurship.

1089
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:37,270
So you're not teaching
people how to be investors.

1090
01:07:37,271 --> 01:07:40,870
So we do now we teach wants Stanford. Oh,
you do? Okay, well that makes this easy.

1091
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:42,980
So what do you teach?
What are,

1092
01:07:42,990 --> 01:07:47,860
what are the sort of
differentiators in the class? Um,

1093
01:07:48,010 --> 01:07:52,330
what we, what we try to do is
help people understand that

1094
01:07:54,580 --> 01:07:59,580
there are things that we can learn from
these prime mover entrepreneurs who

1095
01:08:00,310 --> 01:08:04,600
create massive abundance. And it's about
more than just having a good product,

1096
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:10,120
product market fit clearly important,
but designing the company,

1097
01:08:10,870 --> 01:08:11,900
what's your culture?

1098
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:14,380
How are you going to define it up
front or just kind of let it happen?

1099
01:08:14,740 --> 01:08:17,360
What's your category?
Or are you going to design your category?

1100
01:08:17,361 --> 01:08:18,290
Just let it happen.

1101
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:23,080
Are you going to chase revenue or are
you going to accumulate attractive

1102
01:08:23,090 --> 01:08:26,900
customers? And so like what we
try to, what we try to emphasize,

1103
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:28,940
we try to emphasize a couple of things.
One is

1104
01:08:30,470 --> 01:08:35,470
great businesses truly are valuable and
so we should try to think about building

1105
01:08:36,411 --> 01:08:39,920
a scale of the business with the truth
value in mind rather than what's the

1106
01:08:39,921 --> 01:08:44,090
latest fad and how do we raise money or
what's the paper Unicorn or any of that

1107
01:08:44,091 --> 01:08:46,760
stuff.
But then the other thing that we,

1108
01:08:46,820 --> 01:08:51,820
we worry about some is that you look at
some of these companies and the problems

1109
01:08:51,891 --> 01:08:56,891
they've had with their culture and a lot
of these people come from Stanford or

1110
01:08:58,340 --> 01:09:03,340
the top schools and it's like it
how do we have some impact where if,

1111
01:09:05,260 --> 01:09:10,010
if, if only one person who might have
gone off the rails as a founder in that

1112
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:14,930
dimension doesn't. Because we're
like, you know, culture matters.

1113
01:09:15,290 --> 01:09:20,290
A building company foundation matters
how people treat each other matters and

1114
01:09:20,361 --> 01:09:23,150
some of this stuff is like a blockchain
transaction. You'd get it wrong.

1115
01:09:23,151 --> 01:09:27,350
You can't go backwards or
like the metaphor I like to
use like the Hertz rental

1116
01:09:27,351 --> 01:09:31,460
car parking lot, if you back up
the tires explode and so you can't,

1117
01:09:31,820 --> 01:09:33,890
some of this stuff you
can't really back up.

1118
01:09:33,891 --> 01:09:36,680
And so getting it right the first time,

1119
01:09:36,681 --> 01:09:40,010
there's a lot of counterintuitive lessons
and it's more about just having a good

1120
01:09:40,011 --> 01:09:44,270
product. It's about designing a company
in a category in addition to the product.

1121
01:09:44,750 --> 01:09:45,710
And you know,

1122
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:48,920
having a point of view about how you're
going to bring abundance to the world

1123
01:09:48,921 --> 01:09:49,910
and not just get rich.

1124
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:55,300
And so the class is sort of
about that and about just like,

1125
01:09:56,660 --> 01:10:00,650
oh, the other ideas that like you
don't, if you're a prime mover,

1126
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:05,890
you don't just have to be a tech
entrepreneur. Like you could be, uh, uh,

1127
01:10:05,930 --> 01:10:10,560
the French laundry guy who Keller
Thomas Selling. You can be, uh,

1128
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:15,470
Elvis Presley and you invent rock and
roll. Or you can be Albert Einstein.

1129
01:10:15,471 --> 01:10:19,670
You can have a theory or um,
you know,

1130
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:20,960
MLK out a dream.

1131
01:10:21,650 --> 01:10:26,650
But it's sort of the idea that we try to
express to people is find your gift and

1132
01:10:29,451 --> 01:10:32,350
express it your way.
And um,

1133
01:10:32,420 --> 01:10:35,390
entrepreneurship is only one
way to express that gift.

1134
01:10:36,020 --> 01:10:37,940
But if they learn anything from the class,

1135
01:10:37,941 --> 01:10:40,970
it's not be an entrepreneur
like these people.

1136
01:10:41,180 --> 01:10:43,820
If entrepreneurship happens
to be your calling, great,

1137
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:48,440
here's what great people do, but figure
out your calling, figure out your gift.

1138
01:10:48,441 --> 01:10:51,830
You don't have much time.
Don't live someone else's life.

1139
01:10:51,831 --> 01:10:53,600
Don't live by somebody else's thinking,

1140
01:10:53,990 --> 01:10:58,340
live your gift and
actualize it to the fullest.

1141
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:03,050
How do people who say hear that?

1142
01:11:03,610 --> 01:11:07,020
And I'm sure you go into a much more
detailed in the class, there's 13,

1143
01:11:07,660 --> 01:11:11,090
13 lectures. But for those
people listening, if they
wanted a place to start,

1144
01:11:11,091 --> 01:11:13,410
just to get a toe hold and they
say, God, I want to do that.

1145
01:11:13,411 --> 01:11:16,860
I just don't know what my gift is.
What would you say to them?

1146
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:19,230
Like what are the sort of
whispers through the ether?

1147
01:11:19,231 --> 01:11:20,900
They should pay attention to her.
Any indication.

1148
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,690
I'd say spend time with
awesome people and, uh,

1149
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:28,950
work on things with them
and, uh, you'll find it.

1150
01:11:29,490 --> 01:11:34,260
But most people,
most people fail to find their gift,

1151
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:37,080
not because they can't find it,

1152
01:11:37,590 --> 01:11:40,320
it's because they're too busy worrying
about what other people think.

1153
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:43,630
And like one of the things that I find,
uh,

1154
01:11:44,450 --> 01:11:48,990
so like one of the things I
find inspiring is that, um, I,

1155
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:52,590
I wrote this post one time and
I was surprised that, so a,

1156
01:11:52,591 --> 01:11:54,570
I call it finding billion dollar secrets.

1157
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:59,490
And the point that I was trying to make
was that billion dollar secrets are

1158
01:11:59,491 --> 01:12:03,510
everywhere. It's just that people aren't
looking to pick them up off the ground.

1159
01:12:03,511 --> 01:12:08,310
They're looking at each other,
they're looking at status,
they're looking at, hey,

1160
01:12:08,311 --> 01:12:09,330
when I was in high school,

1161
01:12:09,331 --> 01:12:13,140
I got rewarded for giving the teacher
the answer to the questions the way they

1162
01:12:13,141 --> 01:12:13,974
wanted it,

1163
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:17,970
and then I went to the right college
and got the right to graduate degree and

1164
01:12:17,971 --> 01:12:21,570
got the right job at the right company
and live in the right neighborhood and

1165
01:12:21,571 --> 01:12:25,440
had the right designer kids and send them
to the right designer schools and was

1166
01:12:25,441 --> 01:12:29,970
in the right country. Clubs drive
my right designer car and they get,

1167
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,860
they get focused on,

1168
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:35,740
you know Peter Teal would probably call
this magnetic behavior, right? This,

1169
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:40,760
this idea of people's desires
being defined by the people
around them and what's

1170
01:12:41,611 --> 01:12:43,410
going to make a good impression
on the people around them.

1171
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:46,890
The best entrepreneurs I know,
they're just like, screw all that.

1172
01:12:47,220 --> 01:12:51,630
I know why I'm here in this world,
that secret on the ground.

1173
01:12:51,631 --> 01:12:56,490
That's my gift on picking it up. I'm
doing this and, and like that to me,

1174
01:12:57,270 --> 01:13:00,600
that's the thing I tell my 20 year
old self, my 15 year old self,

1175
01:13:00,601 --> 01:13:05,340
my kids is like, figure
out your gift, your gift.

1176
01:13:05,341 --> 01:13:08,850
It's not, it's not the world's
opinion of your gift. It is yours.

1177
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:13,880
It belongs to you and figure out the
gift that belongs to you and express your

1178
01:13:15,661 --> 01:13:20,661
gratitude for the time you
have by offering that gift.

1179
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:23,273
I love it.

1180
01:13:23,350 --> 01:13:28,350
[inaudible] you

1181
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:33,410
guys can see why I've bugged Mike so
much over the years. The questions,

1182
01:13:34,070 --> 01:13:38,680
speaking of questions. Sure. Boy.

1183
01:13:39,470 --> 01:13:42,620
Wow. This must be, this is like the
Willy Wonka golden ticket of questions.

1184
01:13:44,150 --> 01:13:49,010
Thanks. Oh Wow. Look at this. Oh,
look at that road question givers.

1185
01:13:49,030 --> 01:13:53,230
All right.
I hope a lot of these,

1186
01:13:53,290 --> 01:13:56,570
I had no idea it was a lot more
from your answers. I think.

1187
01:13:56,571 --> 01:14:00,710
I know this is like the Improv jazz
of question receiving. All right,

1188
01:14:01,610 --> 01:14:03,590
so I'll, I'll start with the, uh,

1189
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:08,130
start with the first one and then we'll
just kind of bounced between these.

1190
01:14:08,131 --> 01:14:11,980
So the Oh God, a two
part always, which by the

1191
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:16,870
way means two questions. Where would
you have moved besides Austin? Uh,

1192
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:20,110
there are a few places I looked,
I looked at, I love Austin.

1193
01:14:20,111 --> 01:14:22,270
I've wanted to move there
since I graduated from
school and she didn't get the

1194
01:14:22,271 --> 01:14:25,690
job at trilogy software. Funny
Story, founder of trilogy.

1195
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:30,900
It was my roommate in college, so I
could have helped you looked, you know,

1196
01:14:30,950 --> 01:14:34,750
I didn't know what to do. I was, I was,
I was, I was lost a babe in the woods.

1197
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:38,320
So Boulder, Colorado. I'm
a huge fan of boulder.

1198
01:14:38,460 --> 01:14:41,170
I also looked at BC.

1199
01:14:41,230 --> 01:14:45,070
I really like British Columbia
and areas up in Canada.

1200
01:14:45,970 --> 01:14:50,700
Uh, sorry, Americans.
Thank you. Uh, and uh,

1201
01:14:51,310 --> 01:14:53,350
there were many different
places that I considered,

1202
01:14:53,351 --> 01:14:56,440
but Austin has this gravitational
pull for me, so I ended up there.

1203
01:14:56,710 --> 01:15:00,520
What changed my mind or on the
significance of fiction versus nonfiction?

1204
01:15:00,521 --> 01:15:05,470
Really it was because I had onset
insomnia and I did not want to turn on my

1205
01:15:05,471 --> 01:15:08,830
problem solving apparatus by reading
business books and so on before bed.

1206
01:15:08,860 --> 01:15:13,780
And I found that fantasy dune Ender's
game stranger in a strange land,

1207
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:16,120
uh, the name of the wind. Read that,

1208
01:15:16,121 --> 01:15:19,450
but be prepared to wait like 17
years for the last and the trilogy.

1209
01:15:19,510 --> 01:15:23,650
You ever read that Crowd Count of Monte
Cristo? You don't haven't, oh my gosh.

1210
01:15:23,740 --> 01:15:27,630
Speaking of a book about grudges,
what,

1211
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:29,680
since we're on books,
what,

1212
01:15:29,681 --> 01:15:33,410
what books do you most
recommend or gifted the other

1213
01:15:33,410 --> 01:15:38,300
people? Hmm. Gosh, uh,
lately I've liked, um,

1214
01:15:38,390 --> 01:15:41,390
there's a,
there's a woman named Bronnie ware called,

1215
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:46,640
she wrote a book called the top five
regrets of the dying and she was a hospice

1216
01:15:46,641 --> 01:15:50,180
nurse who would spend time with people
in the last 90 days of their life.

1217
01:15:50,930 --> 01:15:52,370
And um,
she would,

1218
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:56,870
she would learn like what their regrets
were or sometimes she'd learned what

1219
01:15:56,871 --> 01:16:00,110
their happiness was. So, um,

1220
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:05,050
there was an example of this woman
who was from super rich family and uh,

1221
01:16:05,090 --> 01:16:08,450
she decided to marry an
artist in the family.

1222
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:12,410
Ex communicated her and
she's like 32 years old,

1223
01:16:12,411 --> 01:16:17,411
she gets cancer and she dies and she
hasn't heard from her family and years.

1224
01:16:18,230 --> 01:16:22,880
And, uh, her mom comes to her at the end
and says, uh, you know, to be honest,

1225
01:16:22,881 --> 01:16:24,110
I was just jealous.

1226
01:16:24,230 --> 01:16:28,220
You were living life on your own terms
and I've got all these obligations,

1227
01:16:28,221 --> 01:16:29,810
I don't even like my life that much.

1228
01:16:30,530 --> 01:16:34,730
And I was just kind of pissed off that
you could go marry some artists and be

1229
01:16:34,731 --> 01:16:38,630
this happy.
And I realize like how wrong I was.

1230
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:41,690
But this woman who's Diane says,
I have no regrets.

1231
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:43,430
I got to be with the person
that I wanted to be with.

1232
01:16:43,460 --> 01:16:45,530
And like I would've loved
to have lived longer,

1233
01:16:45,531 --> 01:16:47,630
but nobody knows how much
time they're going to have.

1234
01:16:48,050 --> 01:16:51,710
At least I got to have the time that I
got the way I wanted to have it the best

1235
01:16:51,711 --> 01:16:52,660
I knew how.
And,

1236
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:56,330
and then they would have another
person who the opposite was true.

1237
01:16:56,331 --> 01:16:57,860
They would be dying and they'd say,

1238
01:16:58,070 --> 01:17:02,300
promise me brawny that you will not
live life according to other people's

1239
01:17:02,301 --> 01:17:02,990
thinking.

1240
01:17:02,990 --> 01:17:07,490
Cause I live my whole life trying to
please other people and if I could have it

1241
01:17:07,491 --> 01:17:09,820
over again, I wouldn't
do that. And so she,

1242
01:17:09,821 --> 01:17:14,030
she does a great job of like having the
example of the person who did it well

1243
01:17:14,031 --> 01:17:18,020
with no regrets and the person who's
like, fuck right, I'm dead now.

1244
01:17:18,021 --> 01:17:22,960
And like I could do it over
again, I'd do it different.
And so, so, um, and, and it's,

1245
01:17:22,980 --> 01:17:25,370
it's motivating to say, gosh, you know,

1246
01:17:25,580 --> 01:17:29,180
how am I measuring up against
those five things? And so,

1247
01:17:29,181 --> 01:17:33,470
so I like that book because it kind of
takes people out of the here and now and

1248
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:37,580
kind of forces you to confront
a broader set of issues.

1249
01:17:39,450 --> 01:17:44,420
Yeah, I think that for me in the last
few years, I had a lot of death, uh,

1250
01:17:45,330 --> 01:17:47,580
friends pass away in the
last two years or so,

1251
01:17:47,670 --> 01:17:50,520
and including Terry Laughlin,

1252
01:17:50,820 --> 01:17:53,730
rest in peace who is in this
book and just a few weeks ago.

1253
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:57,570
And I found it really in an odd way,

1254
01:17:57,780 --> 01:18:02,780
reaffirming to familiarize myself
with death and grief and grieving,

1255
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:09,330
uh, and in, in almost a preemptive
way. I mean, one of my favorite people,

1256
01:18:10,050 --> 01:18:13,770
I'm sure you've spent time with Matt
Mullenweg, incredible entrepreneur,

1257
01:18:13,771 --> 01:18:16,410
but first and foremost,
just a beautiful human being.

1258
01:18:16,411 --> 01:18:19,170
And he lost his father
in a very unexpected way.

1259
01:18:19,171 --> 01:18:23,640
And he recommended on grief and
grieving to me. And I think it's,

1260
01:18:23,641 --> 01:18:28,641
I think it's a very useful exercise to
familiarize yourself with the details of

1261
01:18:28,831 --> 01:18:30,090
death and people passing.

1262
01:18:30,890 --> 01:18:34,730
And I learned a lot of this from Julie
who is my love of my life and puts up

1263
01:18:34,731 --> 01:18:37,130
with me and uh,
you know,

1264
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:41,660
she's helped all these people who
have had cancer. And so as a result,

1265
01:18:41,661 --> 01:18:45,590
she ends up seeing a lot of people pass.
And you know,

1266
01:18:45,830 --> 01:18:50,730
I think more than anybody, she
taught me that in the last, um,

1267
01:18:52,970 --> 01:18:57,440
the last bit of time you have
all the shit falls away, right?

1268
01:18:57,710 --> 01:19:01,220
All the expectations,
all the external stuff.

1269
01:19:01,790 --> 01:19:05,060
And so you just hope that when that,
when that time comes, you're like,

1270
01:19:05,990 --> 01:19:10,970
I did the best I could, you know,
do it the way I could. And so, um,

1271
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:15,080
that's, uh, that's why I
find that that book helpful.

1272
01:19:15,081 --> 01:19:18,530
It's not cause I'm preoccupied with dying.
I hope I live a long time,

1273
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:23,090
but it's like when the time comes,
I want to say I did it my way.

1274
01:19:23,091 --> 01:19:25,640
I did the best I could.
I honored the gift.

1275
01:19:30,990 --> 01:19:31,823
That's a good book.

1276
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:36,380
And there's business books too, but
oh, we'll do that. So I think that's a

1277
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,420
good place to, to move. Ours is
everybody. Cool life. You have to leave.

1278
01:19:41,421 --> 01:19:43,700
You have to leave at people
call with going a little longer

1279
01:19:46,580 --> 01:19:50,500
fun. I hope you guys all
right. So here we go. Uh,

1280
01:19:51,660 --> 01:19:53,700
this is the left turn from
when we were talking about,

1281
01:19:53,701 --> 01:19:55,140
but I'm curious to hear your answer.

1282
01:19:55,141 --> 01:20:00,141
What emerging technologies or theoretical
technology that can really go wide,

1283
01:20:02,030 --> 01:20:05,910
uh, do you believe are most promising
for anti authoritarian disruption?

1284
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:10,350
How that's a leading question is similar
to how bitcoin disrupts government

1285
01:20:10,351 --> 01:20:14,940
control of money. Maybe. Uh, I'm very
interested in crypto and blockchain.

1286
01:20:14,941 --> 01:20:16,380
You mentioned blockchain earlier,

1287
01:20:16,381 --> 01:20:19,810
so I'm going to too bad we don't have an
involved here. Yeah, that'd be awesome.

1288
01:20:20,580 --> 01:20:23,910
But I would be curious to,
to hear first your thoughts,

1289
01:20:23,940 --> 01:20:28,940
general thoughts on crypto and
blockchain and then any other emerging

1290
01:20:30,301 --> 01:20:34,350
technologies that you think are promising
for anti-authority disruption. Okay.

1291
01:20:35,220 --> 01:20:39,900
So, um, uh, I hope this isn't a
shaggy dog answer. Uh, but, uh,

1292
01:20:40,530 --> 01:20:44,310
I don't even know what that is, but the
stories a really long story, your friends.

1293
01:20:44,330 --> 01:20:47,430
But um, so, so for better or worse,

1294
01:20:47,460 --> 01:20:50,010
I'm a little bit of a history
buff when it comes to business.

1295
01:20:50,011 --> 01:20:55,011
And so I took this class when I was in
business school and only Harvard business

1296
01:20:55,381 --> 01:20:59,730
school would have a class called the
coming of managerial capitalism. And uh,

1297
01:20:59,970 --> 01:21:03,870
but it was a fascinating class because
he named roles like for example,

1298
01:21:03,871 --> 01:21:05,520
like in the year 1820,

1299
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:08,850
there weren't any companies in America
with more than a hundred employees,

1300
01:21:09,330 --> 01:21:12,870
you know, cause you had people
trading, selling muskets or for,

1301
01:21:12,871 --> 01:21:15,780
or like if you are a
really big monster company,

1302
01:21:15,781 --> 01:21:20,310
you were like a spinning loom and
Waltham, Massachusetts, uh, and,

1303
01:21:20,311 --> 01:21:22,590
and spinning yarn and fabric.

1304
01:21:23,220 --> 01:21:26,880
Well then the railroad and
the steam engine come out
and that changes everything.

1305
01:21:27,450 --> 01:21:32,130
So like what people don't realize about
people like John Rockefeller and JP

1306
01:21:32,130 --> 01:21:34,260
Morgan and Andrew Carnegie,
like,

1307
01:21:34,261 --> 01:21:38,460
imagine you're doing standard oil
and you want to compete with a guy in

1308
01:21:38,461 --> 01:21:40,290
Pennsylvania on oil prices.

1309
01:21:40,740 --> 01:21:45,090
You don't just whip out your cell phone
and call the branch manager and say, Hey,

1310
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:49,920
lower the prices. Run this guy out of
business. I mean, there's no accounting,

1311
01:21:50,220 --> 01:21:53,310
there's no org charts,
there's no salary managers.

1312
01:21:53,550 --> 01:21:57,960
We don't even have the telegraph
yet. We don't have shit. Right?

1313
01:21:58,380 --> 01:22:03,380
And like Rockefeller is building
the company against that backdrop.

1314
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:06,870
And then you know, JP Morgan's like, well,

1315
01:22:06,871 --> 01:22:10,440
there's nobody who has enough money
to own a transcontinental railroad,

1316
01:22:10,650 --> 01:22:13,770
so maybe I should do this thing where
you create these fractional units of

1317
01:22:13,771 --> 01:22:17,540
ownership of a company.
We'll call it stock. You're,

1318
01:22:17,550 --> 01:22:21,450
you're some guy who sells your
blacksmith and 1820 and somebody says,

1319
01:22:21,451 --> 01:22:23,640
do you want buy stock in a railroad?
You're like,

1320
01:22:23,641 --> 01:22:28,620
what good does that do me stock in
some random company. It doesn't exist.

1321
01:22:28,830 --> 01:22:31,290
Why would I want that?
And so like,

1322
01:22:32,010 --> 01:22:37,010
but what happened was the
modern corporation emerged
and it drove the standard

1323
01:22:40,411 --> 01:22:45,411
of living of humanity 13 fold from the
year 1820 to 2000 the richest man in

1324
01:22:46,501 --> 01:22:51,120
American 1870 was Cornelius Vanderbilt.
He didn't have flushing toilets.

1325
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:53,640
He didn't have running water.
He didn't have electricity.

1326
01:22:55,020 --> 01:22:58,650
You can have all those three
things now and be defined as poor.

1327
01:22:59,700 --> 01:23:03,390
And so I look at it and I'm like, people
say capitalism is screwed up. I'm like,

1328
01:23:03,870 --> 01:23:08,230
what are you talking about? Like
I'm like, it's a freaking miracle.

1329
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:13,440
It's like it in 1800 you had to work
one hour to get six minutes of reading

1330
01:23:14,501 --> 01:23:17,680
light.
Today you work one hour,

1331
01:23:17,681 --> 01:23:21,950
you get 300 days of reading
light. It's a miracle. And,

1332
01:23:21,951 --> 01:23:22,900
and you know,

1333
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:26,590
there's a lot of stuff that is wrong with
how people are practicing capitalism,

1334
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:31,270
but free trade and voluntary,
you know, I have this to offer,

1335
01:23:31,271 --> 01:23:34,660
you have that to offer. We get to
trade without somebody interference.

1336
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:38,140
That's not the problem. That's
not the problem we have. Well,

1337
01:23:38,141 --> 01:23:41,260
what I think is happening today,
and this is where blockchain gets in.

1338
01:23:41,261 --> 01:23:44,340
I'm hearing a little Texas,
sorry for this share. No, no. Uh,

1339
01:23:44,470 --> 01:23:49,420
I believe that that blockchain
and things like it and, and, uh,

1340
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:53,500
Moore's law Metcalf's law
or the fundamental animating
forces of what I like to

1341
01:23:53,501 --> 01:23:54,820
call network capitalism.

1342
01:23:55,390 --> 01:24:00,070
And I believe that someday
value is going to be created,

1343
01:24:00,071 --> 01:24:04,270
not by creating a large company. We have
a lot of employees that work for you,

1344
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:08,290
uh, and produce a lot
of stuff, but it's dead.

1345
01:24:08,291 --> 01:24:12,850
It's going to be the people who create
and curate software to find networks. And,

1346
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:16,900
um, I think that Tesla is a software
network defined car company.

1347
01:24:16,901 --> 01:24:20,470
And I think that apple was a software
network defined phone company.

1348
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:23,980
Nokia thought they sell
widgets. Apple thought, no,

1349
01:24:23,981 --> 01:24:25,780
we sell sell software to find phone.

1350
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:31,210
The bet between Tesla and GM has nothing
to do with WHO's selling more cars.

1351
01:24:31,240 --> 01:24:35,770
It said we'll Tesla figure
out manufacturing faster
than GM figures out how to

1352
01:24:35,771 --> 01:24:39,370
be a software to find network capitalist
company. Right? So, so like, okay,

1353
01:24:39,371 --> 01:24:42,190
now back to blockchain. Uh, there's a,

1354
01:24:42,220 --> 01:24:46,210
there's a book called like a lot called
the wealth of networks by Yo. Hi Bankler.

1355
01:24:46,211 --> 01:24:49,930
I read it about 10 years ago and
it influenced my investing a lot.

1356
01:24:50,440 --> 01:24:55,440
And one of the things that that Bankler
talked about was we're going to move

1357
01:24:56,411 --> 01:24:59,590
from the tragedy of the Commons
to the wealth of the Commons.

1358
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:03,430
And the examples he used back then,
he had dig in the book actually.

1359
01:25:03,431 --> 01:25:07,450
And he had examples of user generated
content, open source software.

1360
01:25:07,930 --> 01:25:12,930
Well what if just like the stock market
was a new way to practice capitalism for

1361
01:25:13,031 --> 01:25:15,790
the modern corporation animated
by the railroad, the steam engine,

1362
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:21,120
that is a new way to create abundance
because you couldn't have had a national

1363
01:25:21,401 --> 01:25:24,760
railroad unless you had a stock
market. You couldn't have said, hey,

1364
01:25:24,761 --> 01:25:28,480
who has enough money to build a railroad?
There was no one person who did.

1365
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:33,960
And so now I believe that crypto has
the opportunity create the wealth of the

1366
01:25:34,121 --> 01:25:36,360
Commons.
And um,

1367
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:41,400
rather than a centrally organized
equity capital structure,

1368
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:45,700
you have a set of people who contribute
to a project on their own volition.

1369
01:25:46,210 --> 01:25:47,860
And if the other people,

1370
01:25:47,861 --> 01:25:52,510
their peers in the community judge their
value as compelling, they get rewarded.

1371
01:25:53,380 --> 01:25:56,980
So it's, it's kind of like the
wealth of the Commons, but like,

1372
01:25:56,981 --> 01:26:01,900
I find it easier to think about
Crypto, not through the lens of, Oh,

1373
01:26:01,901 --> 01:26:03,560
sorry,
you're gonna Invest in Crypto company.

1374
01:26:03,561 --> 01:26:05,720
How many shares are you going to own?
That's wrong.

1375
01:26:06,140 --> 01:26:10,580
That's like asking how many dollars or
am I going to own in the transcontinental

1376
01:26:10,581 --> 01:26:14,660
railroad? No stock units or a new
thing. Yeah, it's a different unit.

1377
01:26:14,690 --> 01:26:18,680
Crypto tokens are a new thing.
They are a new way to create wealth.

1378
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:23,000
They are a new way to leverage the
wealth of networks rather than vertically

1379
01:26:23,001 --> 01:26:25,670
integrated top down owned companies.

1380
01:26:26,270 --> 01:26:30,550
And so like I just believe that
a hundred years from now, uh,

1381
01:26:31,730 --> 01:26:36,730
tokens or something like them will be
one of many ways that a enterprise and

1382
01:26:38,241 --> 01:26:41,720
capitalists can create abundance in the
world and the more ways we can create

1383
01:26:41,721 --> 01:26:42,554
abundance of better,

1384
01:26:42,890 --> 01:26:46,850
does that obliterate ventral cap venture
capital as we know it or does it just

1385
01:26:46,851 --> 01:26:49,580
reconfigure it so that you guys are
investing in the pickaxes? Yeah,

1386
01:26:49,581 --> 01:26:51,260
so like I don't really,
it's funny,

1387
01:26:51,261 --> 01:26:54,500
so like I'm friends with Vinny Lingham
who did civic and the first time we met

1388
01:26:54,501 --> 01:26:57,320
he's like, Hey, I see
owners make you irrelevant,

1389
01:26:57,321 --> 01:27:02,210
but I'm happy to give you courtesy of
my time. And I'm like, Vinny, like,

1390
01:27:02,330 --> 01:27:05,600
look, I'm just not afraid of
what's going to be done to me.

1391
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:09,350
The question I asked today is,
what would JP Morgan do if he's alive?

1392
01:27:10,370 --> 01:27:14,330
JP Morgan wouldn't be like, oh, how am I
going to get disrupted? Oji He'd be like,

1393
01:27:14,420 --> 01:27:19,420
how can I play off fence with crypto and
how can I create new businesses rather

1394
01:27:20,751 --> 01:27:24,950
than, you know, like Elvis didn't
say I'm going to disrupt jazz, right?

1395
01:27:24,951 --> 01:27:29,210
He wanted to create rock and roll. And
like when I look about Crypto, I'm like,

1396
01:27:29,450 --> 01:27:31,940
what would Elvis think?
What would JP Morgan think?

1397
01:27:32,930 --> 01:27:37,070
I think disruption in tech startups
kind of bullshit. None of the,

1398
01:27:37,100 --> 01:27:40,120
none of the tech startups I've invested
in had people who said, you know,

1399
01:27:40,121 --> 01:27:43,610
Logan and John didn't say death
to taxis, right? They were like,

1400
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:45,740
ride sharing is going to be awesome.

1401
01:27:46,190 --> 01:27:50,360
It's going to bring people together
and make things better. And um,

1402
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:54,560
disruption happens after
you win almost by accident.

1403
01:27:54,830 --> 01:27:57,740
And it doesn't happen because
you try to defeat taxis.

1404
01:27:57,741 --> 01:28:01,250
It happens because you
transcend taxis and, and like,

1405
01:28:01,490 --> 01:28:04,820
so like whenever people say, I'm going
to disrupt something, I'm like, well,

1406
01:28:04,821 --> 01:28:08,270
you're not a real entrepreneur because
entrepreneurship comes from love and

1407
01:28:08,271 --> 01:28:12,740
creation, not from anger and disruption.
And what am I going to attack?

1408
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:15,280
And so like I don't like,
I'm not going to get

1409
01:28:15,310 --> 01:28:18,490
disrupted by crypto any
more than the next guy will.

1410
01:28:19,480 --> 01:28:21,700
So just Jamie diamond might,

1411
01:28:23,410 --> 01:28:27,310
by the way, I'd be happy to debate
him anytime and anywhere. Ooh, like

1412
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:30,490
this. This is the rumble in
the jungle. Jamie diamond.

1413
01:28:30,491 --> 01:28:33,460
I can't wait for this to happen.
So just so nobody gets fired.

1414
01:28:33,461 --> 01:28:36,310
I did get the wrap up.
Smiley face sign,

1415
01:28:36,340 --> 01:28:40,690
but I'm going to temporarily ignore that.
I apologize.

1416
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:43,780
Just so that everybody knows someone
who's done their duty and I'm going to

1417
01:28:43,781 --> 01:28:46,120
continue for a few more
questions and then we'll wrap up.

1418
01:28:46,180 --> 01:28:48,840
I appreciate everyone okay with that.
Cool.

1419
01:28:50,210 --> 01:28:51,850
Because I'm having fun with my Bud Mike.

1420
01:28:52,240 --> 01:28:56,530
Uh Oh my God.
All these questions.

1421
01:28:56,531 --> 01:28:57,670
I wonder if this is the same person,

1422
01:28:57,910 --> 01:29:02,190
what nascent tech could most disempowered
the state where you see tech potential

1423
01:29:02,190 --> 01:29:06,650
for removing government control over the
individual? Holy Shit. We got a bunch of,

1424
01:29:06,670 --> 01:29:07,620
so the way,

1425
01:29:08,100 --> 01:29:12,000
this is one of the reasons I liked the
wealth of networks is that the wealth and

1426
01:29:12,001 --> 01:29:17,001
networks potentially creates the opening
to reestablish the idea of trade is a

1427
01:29:18,181 --> 01:29:20,160
voluntary activity between people.

1428
01:29:20,430 --> 01:29:24,690
And the government's role is not to own
everything or legislate everything or

1429
01:29:24,691 --> 01:29:27,870
give her buddy handouts or
free Scooby snacks. It's too,

1430
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:30,420
it is to protect the rights of people.

1431
01:29:30,570 --> 01:29:34,770
That's why I believe valid role of
governments protect the rights of people.

1432
01:29:35,370 --> 01:29:40,260
And what we've allowed our government
to do is to have unsound practices with

1433
01:29:40,261 --> 01:29:43,950
how they create, how they treat
money, right? So the Fed is,

1434
01:29:44,060 --> 01:29:47,220
and with the money supply and
it's hurting honest people,

1435
01:29:47,221 --> 01:29:48,960
but if we want to explore that we can,

1436
01:29:48,961 --> 01:29:53,130
but like the Fed jacking with the money
supply is picking the pockets of the

1437
01:29:53,131 --> 01:29:57,150
middle class and it is
a right. And um, and,

1438
01:29:57,151 --> 01:30:02,151
and like the crypto has the opportunity
to say money should have a price just

1439
01:30:03,511 --> 01:30:07,320
like everything else. And just like we
need to separate politics and religion.

1440
01:30:07,321 --> 01:30:09,140
We need to separate
politics and economics.

1441
01:30:10,260 --> 01:30:11,093
Whoa.

1442
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:19,580
Oh my God. We'd get on so many
Rad. No, no, no. It's great.

1443
01:30:21,690 --> 01:30:21,970
Yeah,

1444
01:30:21,970 --> 01:30:24,260
man. I can't wait for this rumble
in the jungle. Jimmy diamond.

1445
01:30:24,261 --> 01:30:28,100
It's going to be great. I don't want
front row tickets. All right. Uh,

1446
01:30:28,180 --> 01:30:31,390
what were the traits that you had
early on that made you successful?

1447
01:30:33,530 --> 01:30:33,840
Yeah,

1448
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:34,720
I'll just leave it at that.

1449
01:30:34,750 --> 01:30:38,620
That's from Jignesh and I'll leave the
last name out just so I don't have to get

1450
01:30:38,621 --> 01:30:42,750
permission for keeping you on the podcast.
Um,

1451
01:30:42,820 --> 01:30:46,260
I just think that, uh, I
was lucky that, um, uh,

1452
01:30:46,290 --> 01:30:51,250
I was born with parents who were just
really good to me and inspired me in ways

1453
01:30:51,251 --> 01:30:54,820
that were surprising that
I didn't understand at the
time. Like when I was, uh,

1454
01:30:55,890 --> 01:30:57,310
we're not,
when I was in third grade,

1455
01:30:57,311 --> 01:31:00,760
my dad bought me this book called how
it works, illustrated for my birthday.

1456
01:31:00,761 --> 01:31:04,810
It was all these diagrams and how product,
you know, how it is dishwasher work,

1457
01:31:04,811 --> 01:31:07,570
how does it get this book? It's
a great, it's a great book.

1458
01:31:07,900 --> 01:31:10,440
And he writes in the front, it's like, um,

1459
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:14,350
I know is a little bit advanced
for third grader, but uh, you know,

1460
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:17,830
it'll make you think differently
about life and uh, you know,

1461
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:20,980
someday you're going to invent things
are going to be in a book like this.

1462
01:31:23,460 --> 01:31:23,660
Yup.

1463
01:31:23,660 --> 01:31:28,100
What is it like, who has parrots like
that? Like I didn't decide that. Yeah.

1464
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:33,020
Just like, just like, uh, you're,
you know, when you're a parent,

1465
01:31:33,170 --> 01:31:34,460
your kids are you nothing.

1466
01:31:35,030 --> 01:31:38,450
It doesn't mean you can't be grateful
when you get lucky and have good ones.

1467
01:31:39,740 --> 01:31:41,330
Yeah. Here, here.

1468
01:31:43,620 --> 01:31:47,540
Yeah. I'm curious about
that too. Ah, you know, I,

1469
01:31:48,060 --> 01:31:50,880
I also, I think in a lot of
ways won the parent lottery.

1470
01:31:50,881 --> 01:31:52,650
I wish I could give a
better answer, but it, well,

1471
01:31:52,651 --> 01:31:53,820
the one thing that my parents did,

1472
01:31:53,821 --> 01:31:58,650
they were there a few things my parents
did that I think were very helpful in

1473
01:31:58,660 --> 01:32:00,070
retrospect.
Now it's all

1474
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:04,270
kind of post hoc analysis,
right? So who knows?

1475
01:32:04,271 --> 01:32:08,830
But I would say number one, I, you
know, I wasn't, it's not like we,

1476
01:32:09,100 --> 01:32:11,100
we didn't have a flushing
toilet and electricity's,

1477
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:12,500
it's not like my parents
would go your board,

1478
01:32:12,501 --> 01:32:15,010
but we didn't have her neos
Vanderbilt. Yeah. But we didn't have,

1479
01:32:15,011 --> 01:32:19,210
we didn't have a lot of extra
cash floating around, uh,

1480
01:32:19,530 --> 01:32:23,680
parents that are made more than 50 grand
or so a year combined. And, um, anyway,

1481
01:32:23,780 --> 01:32:28,360
the point was two things.
Number one is they said, no,
you can't have the new bike,

1482
01:32:29,140 --> 01:32:33,910
can't do it, can't do this.
But they said this is, I mean,

1483
01:32:33,911 --> 01:32:37,900
maybe it was by necessity,
not by engineering,

1484
01:32:37,901 --> 01:32:41,080
but they said the one thing,
we have budget for his books.

1485
01:32:41,890 --> 01:32:45,040
So if you really want a book,
like we'll figure it out.

1486
01:32:45,070 --> 01:32:49,270
And so we used to go to the remainder
table in this bookstore or our local

1487
01:32:49,310 --> 01:32:53,320
hometown and pick books. And I remember
to this day, some of those books,

1488
01:32:53,321 --> 01:32:55,480
just like you do, fishes of the
world was when I wanted to be,

1489
01:32:55,481 --> 01:33:00,481
become a marine biologist for 10 plus
years because of this book and bought it

1490
01:33:01,451 --> 01:33:02,920
for whatever,
70% off.

1491
01:33:03,010 --> 01:33:06,940
And I carried it with me to school every
day because that's the playground for

1492
01:33:06,941 --> 01:33:09,710
me. I was a runner. I was a
really small kid, born premature.

1493
01:33:09,711 --> 01:33:13,300
He got the shit kicked out of me
like weekly until sixth grade.

1494
01:33:13,301 --> 01:33:16,990
So I would stay close to
the teacher with this book.

1495
01:33:17,740 --> 01:33:20,270
And I remember, I don't,
I've never talked about this.

1496
01:33:20,290 --> 01:33:22,390
Remember this one teacher
substitute teacher,

1497
01:33:22,420 --> 01:33:23,830
not my real teachers cause they knew me,

1498
01:33:23,831 --> 01:33:26,620
but the substitute teacher said to
my mom, you know, you shouldn't have,

1499
01:33:26,650 --> 01:33:28,810
you shouldn't let him bring that book
to school. He's going to destroy it.

1500
01:33:28,811 --> 01:33:32,650
And my mom was like, what are you talking
about? Like it's like destroy that book.

1501
01:33:32,651 --> 01:33:36,130
Like it's those important book he has.
And uh,

1502
01:33:36,160 --> 01:33:41,160
they were very good at
training us to want books.

1503
01:33:42,310 --> 01:33:45,850
So that was a key. And
then second was, uh,

1504
01:33:45,880 --> 01:33:48,250
my parents and my mom particularly,

1505
01:33:48,251 --> 01:33:52,040
we're really good at just exposing
me to a lot of stuff. Yup.

1506
01:33:52,270 --> 01:33:54,340
And it was free stuff.
It's like, all right,

1507
01:33:54,341 --> 01:33:57,520
we're going to take a trip to
the aquarium when it's free.

1508
01:33:57,521 --> 01:34:00,490
We're going to go to the beach and
we're going to collect black sand with a

1509
01:34:00,491 --> 01:34:02,590
magnet.
And I'll try to explain it back to Tim is,

1510
01:34:03,220 --> 01:34:06,700
and my mom through so much against the
wall and every once in a while something

1511
01:34:06,701 --> 01:34:09,520
would stick and then she would just
put everything behind it. Yeah.

1512
01:34:09,860 --> 01:34:12,020
Yeah. Me Too. Like I read
some book and I said, well,

1513
01:34:12,021 --> 01:34:16,520
the best example of this dinosaur bones
is in the museum of natural history in

1514
01:34:16,521 --> 01:34:19,580
Washington DC. And my mom would
say, well, we live in Princeton,

1515
01:34:19,581 --> 01:34:23,600
New Jersey at the time. And, uh, there's
a museum of natural history in New York.

1516
01:34:24,060 --> 01:34:28,320
And I'm like, but that's not where the
biggest one is. And that's where like,

1517
01:34:28,340 --> 01:34:29,001
sure enough,

1518
01:34:29,001 --> 01:34:33,710
we'd be going to Washington DC to see
the biggest and like Carolyn Maples,

1519
01:34:33,711 --> 01:34:34,730
like had like,

1520
01:34:34,910 --> 01:34:38,060
if I was interested in dinosaurs and
that's where I wanted to see the biggest

1521
01:34:38,061 --> 01:34:39,980
dinosaur.
Like by Golly,

1522
01:34:39,981 --> 01:34:43,460
we were going to museum of
natural history in Washington DC.

1523
01:34:43,461 --> 01:34:44,540
And maybe while we're at it,

1524
01:34:44,541 --> 01:34:48,570
we'll go to Gettysburg and learn something
about the civil war. But it was uh, uh,

1525
01:34:48,580 --> 01:34:52,170
one other thing that I think is good
and then onto the next thing. But, um,

1526
01:34:52,670 --> 01:34:55,190
my dad also told me don't have heroes.

1527
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:01,000
And I think what he meant by that was
that hero worship is a form of not

1528
01:35:03,891 --> 01:35:07,370
thinking for yourself
because heroes first of all,

1529
01:35:07,371 --> 01:35:11,450
a lot of times they're kind of a story
and you don't really know what they're

1530
01:35:11,451 --> 01:35:14,840
really like and what really happened
and why they decided what they did.

1531
01:35:15,290 --> 01:35:19,700
But the other thing is defining
yourself relative to somebody else's

1532
01:35:19,701 --> 01:35:24,701
accomplishment or how somebody else
acts causes you to not spend the time to

1533
01:35:25,761 --> 01:35:29,450
discover how you can be your best self.
And so like,

1534
01:35:29,930 --> 01:35:34,930
it's okay to respect the way somebody
thinks or it's okay to respect a talent

1535
01:35:35,891 --> 01:35:39,380
that somebody has it you could learn from.
But that's different from saying,

1536
01:35:39,830 --> 01:35:41,570
oh my gosh,
Bill Gates is awesome.

1537
01:35:41,571 --> 01:35:45,230
I want to be like Bill Gates because
Bill Gates is awesome, right?

1538
01:35:45,231 --> 01:35:49,160
He's awesome at being bill gates.
But you need to be awesome at being you.

1539
01:35:49,490 --> 01:35:53,720
And like having a hero can cause
you to drift away from that.

1540
01:35:53,721 --> 01:35:58,430
So my dad was always very, whenever
somebody famous on TV, you know,

1541
01:35:58,431 --> 01:36:01,310
wrong, Reagan was president
when I was young, he'd be like,

1542
01:36:01,311 --> 01:36:05,390
be very careful not to have heroes. You
don't know their whole story. He's like,

1543
01:36:05,391 --> 01:36:09,530
he may be great person, but don't have
it. Don't have that person as a hero.

1544
01:36:09,710 --> 01:36:14,710
Figure out what you admire that
they do and try to understand that.

1545
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:19,580
But don't, don't say, I want to be like
that person ever. It's a good guideline.

1546
01:36:19,610 --> 01:36:22,310
Yeah. That's pretty good. That's pretty
good. I don't know how I figured that out.

1547
01:36:24,620 --> 01:36:28,950
This is a question from anonymous.
Very nice handwriting. Um,

1548
01:36:30,050 --> 01:36:33,980
what would you put on a billboard?
Could be,

1549
01:36:34,040 --> 01:36:37,520
I don't know if you answered
it in the books. I did. He
did. So let's, let's hear.

1550
01:36:37,521 --> 01:36:40,100
It could be that or it could be something
else, but how would you answer that?

1551
01:36:40,101 --> 01:36:42,620
What would you put on the billboard
that got out to millions or billions of

1552
01:36:42,621 --> 01:36:46,100
people? Uh, like, um, there's two things.

1553
01:36:46,101 --> 01:36:49,130
One would be integrity is the only
path where you'll never get lost.

1554
01:36:49,460 --> 01:36:52,520
And that's the one that,
that I put your book.

1555
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:57,170
And then the other one would
be think for yourself always.

1556
01:36:57,920 --> 01:37:01,640
And I'm thinking for yourself
doesn't mean don't listen,

1557
01:37:02,300 --> 01:37:07,300
but it means be willing to have first
principles and you are right or wrong,

1558
01:37:09,411 --> 01:37:13,780
not because of how powerful the
person is who challenges you.

1559
01:37:14,150 --> 01:37:18,140
You are right or wrong based on whether
the content of your ideas and first

1560
01:37:18,141 --> 01:37:20,600
principles as right or wrong.
And you should,

1561
01:37:20,630 --> 01:37:24,290
you should seek out people who challenge
your first principles like goal because

1562
01:37:24,291 --> 01:37:27,140
they'll make you better,
but you shouldn't, you know,

1563
01:37:27,141 --> 01:37:31,640
and that's like ego is about who's
right and truth is about what's right.

1564
01:37:32,150 --> 01:37:36,110
And if you become an authentic
truth seeker in life, uh,

1565
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:41,520
to me that's kind of what it means.
Did like think for yourself? Yeah,

1566
01:37:42,020 --> 01:37:45,440
it's for you. I'm not nurse. I'm not going
to follow that up. Y'all come on guys.

1567
01:37:45,580 --> 01:37:46,640
No,
everybody wants to know.

1568
01:37:46,680 --> 01:37:51,380
You're signing one record player that
says the same thing over and over again.

1569
01:37:51,381 --> 01:37:55,200
All right, so I would say I'm going to
give a new answer, actually have two.

1570
01:37:55,201 --> 01:37:56,460
So the first would be,

1571
01:37:57,270 --> 01:38:01,380
and this is advice I got really early on
that has stuck with me for decades now,

1572
01:38:01,410 --> 01:38:06,410
you're the average of the five people
you associate with most and drew of

1573
01:38:06,601 --> 01:38:07,410
Dropbox.

1574
01:38:07,410 --> 01:38:12,410
Many of the people would give similar
advice and I think it's just so important

1575
01:38:14,100 --> 01:38:15,120
emotionally,
financially,

1576
01:38:15,121 --> 01:38:20,121
psychologically it's very important that
you choose the people you spend time

1577
01:38:21,061 --> 01:38:24,760
with. It doesn't have to be in person, it
can be via podcast, it can be via books,

1578
01:38:24,780 --> 01:38:25,650
they don't have to be alive.

1579
01:38:25,651 --> 01:38:29,010
It could be Ben Franklin and I've learned
so much from Richard Fiman and Ben

1580
01:38:29,010 --> 01:38:31,200
Franklin for instances.
Just two examples.

1581
01:38:32,910 --> 01:38:33,130
And,

1582
01:38:33,130 --> 01:38:37,010
and can I just double down on that because
like it doesn't even have to be five

1583
01:38:37,011 --> 01:38:41,110
people that will help you succeed in
your career. So like, like Julie, right.

1584
01:38:41,111 --> 01:38:45,770
I was talking about earlier, uh, one of,
one of the companies that we invested in,

1585
01:38:46,310 --> 01:38:49,280
the founder's son was 10 years old,

1586
01:38:49,281 --> 01:38:54,260
got a brain tumor and so he has to
be operated on in San Francisco.

1587
01:38:54,890 --> 01:38:58,910
And uh,
Julie calls me and says,

1588
01:38:59,270 --> 01:39:03,500
when are you going to get here? It was
like a few days later and I'm like, uh,

1589
01:39:03,560 --> 01:39:07,850
sorry. Am I supposed to, I'm
in this meeting. I'm like,
where are you? She's like,

1590
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:12,290
I'm here at the hospital.
Who goes about to be operated on?

1591
01:39:12,590 --> 01:39:16,730
Where are you? And I realize
like she never said, hey,

1592
01:39:16,731 --> 01:39:17,990
let's meet at the hospital.

1593
01:39:18,410 --> 01:39:21,380
But like what I realized
from her was that she's like,

1594
01:39:22,040 --> 01:39:25,730
what else are you doing that's more
important than being here right now? Like,

1595
01:39:25,731 --> 01:39:27,020
why did I have to tell you that?

1596
01:39:27,680 --> 01:39:31,250
And she wasn't being judgmental about
it was just to her, it was just obvious.

1597
01:39:31,820 --> 01:39:32,541
And so like,

1598
01:39:32,541 --> 01:39:37,541
part of it is not just five awesome
business people or five fortune 500

1599
01:39:39,621 --> 01:39:41,540
whatever. It's, to me,

1600
01:39:41,541 --> 01:39:46,541
it's more like five people who in their
own way make you appreciate the gift of

1601
01:39:48,651 --> 01:39:52,670
life in a more deep way so
that you practice it better.

1602
01:39:53,240 --> 01:39:55,400
And like where you say,
wow,

1603
01:39:55,700 --> 01:39:59,510
that person changed my point of
view about how to use my time.

1604
01:40:01,120 --> 01:40:02,750
How do you use your life?
Yeah.

1605
01:40:02,850 --> 01:40:05,850
Yeah.
We're going to wrap up in a minute folks.

1606
01:40:07,590 --> 01:40:08,770
Uh,

1607
01:40:09,260 --> 01:40:10,280
I said I would give something new.

1608
01:40:10,281 --> 01:40:13,580
I've given you're the average of the five
people you associate with most a lot.

1609
01:40:13,740 --> 01:40:16,460
So I'll give you another one
to keep interrupting you,

1610
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:21,140
which is relatively recent
discovery for me, which is

1611
01:40:23,210 --> 01:40:26,030
if you want to succeed
in any holistic capacity,

1612
01:40:26,060 --> 01:40:31,060
if you want to love the people you care
for fully and have them feel that you

1613
01:40:34,941 --> 01:40:38,210
cannot do it.
If you merely tolerate yourself,

1614
01:40:39,170 --> 01:40:43,820
you cannot do it. If on some level you
lose yourself or aspects of yourself,

1615
01:40:44,570 --> 01:40:46,910
and I spent,
I mean,

1616
01:40:46,911 --> 01:40:51,080
I've spent decades of my life like
barely at best tolerating myself.

1617
01:40:51,650 --> 01:40:52,910
I had some bad things happen to me.

1618
01:40:54,190 --> 01:40:57,040
I as a consequence,

1619
01:40:57,041 --> 01:41:00,910
decided to just hone myself into an
instrument of competition. That was it,

1620
01:41:01,360 --> 01:41:06,360
and I found validation and a purpose in
that and being number one and the any

1621
01:41:10,391 --> 01:41:13,580
joy I felt, it was really from
observing other people experiencing joy.

1622
01:41:13,580 --> 01:41:17,580
It wasn't intrinsic to me
and I'm

1623
01:41:19,930 --> 01:41:22,840
forgiving yourself. We're loving
yourself as not a nice to have.

1624
01:41:23,380 --> 01:41:24,460
It is a must have.

1625
01:41:25,390 --> 01:41:30,390
Even if you're doing it just for other
people and the people you want to express

1626
01:41:30,791 --> 01:41:35,110
your love to most fully you. You need to
solve that and there are ways to do it.

1627
01:41:35,111 --> 01:41:36,910
There are ways to do it.
That's the good news.

1628
01:41:36,970 --> 01:41:40,990
So I would just say whether it's a book
like Tara Brocks, radical acceptance,

1629
01:41:41,020 --> 01:41:44,310
terrible title,
a great book or Paul's Book,

1630
01:41:44,650 --> 01:41:47,530
love yourself like your life depends on
it. Yeah. Call Robert [inaudible] book.

1631
01:41:47,531 --> 01:41:52,531
Also exceptional of that is I think the
root cause of so many things that we can

1632
01:41:56,411 --> 01:41:59,650
perceive is 30 or 40 or 50
different problems to solve.

1633
01:42:00,310 --> 01:42:04,030
And in fact they're just one or two things
that happened to you that you need to

1634
01:42:04,031 --> 01:42:08,450
unpack. Yep. 10 with, can you double click
on that for a second? Cause I don't like,

1635
01:42:08,451 --> 01:42:11,600
I think it's like people
will sometimes say, Hey,

1636
01:42:11,601 --> 01:42:16,550
you should love yourself and they'll
will dumb down that they won't understand

1637
01:42:16,551 --> 01:42:20,330
the subtlety like of what you just said.
And I think that's important. Yeah.

1638
01:42:20,370 --> 01:42:23,840
So the, the, the subtlety,
if we were to drill down,

1639
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:27,770
I would say that, uh, and this
is borrowing from someone,

1640
01:42:27,771 --> 01:42:31,190
actually it's in the conclusion of Trevor
mentors it because it's that important

1641
01:42:31,191 --> 01:42:32,420
to me.
Um,

1642
01:42:32,630 --> 01:42:37,630
Jim Loehr or lair who's a performance
coach has worked with a lot of incredible

1643
01:42:37,881 --> 01:42:42,020
athletes and he, l, O, e, h, r,

1644
01:42:42,320 --> 01:42:47,240
fascinating guy and his book,
a mental toughness training
for sports. Here you go.

1645
01:42:47,570 --> 01:42:51,560
Uh, Mari more really changed
my life. Sure. You're good
in high school. Don't worry.

1646
01:42:51,730 --> 01:42:53,450
I know I'm getting them.
I'm getting the stink eye.

1647
01:42:56,030 --> 01:42:59,580
I'll make it up to everybody.
Uh, tell the whole story, Tim.

1648
01:43:04,460 --> 01:43:06,340
So,
uh,

1649
01:43:06,770 --> 01:43:10,370
the gym expressed to me when I met with
him to learn how to play tennis for the

1650
01:43:10,371 --> 01:43:13,550
first time, just in the last year, which
had always wanted to do my whole life.

1651
01:43:14,420 --> 01:43:16,450
He said a in effect,
you know,

1652
01:43:16,460 --> 01:43:21,110
the most important voice we ever hear in
our lives is the voice that no one else

1653
01:43:21,111 --> 01:43:23,510
hears.
It's the voice in our own heads.

1654
01:43:24,530 --> 01:43:28,940
And for my entire life, I
would really, my entire life,

1655
01:43:28,970 --> 01:43:30,800
it's been the most merciless,

1656
01:43:30,830 --> 01:43:35,640
brutal coach or wish on your worst day.
Like,

1657
01:43:35,641 --> 01:43:39,600
raise your hand if you said something
to yourself negative in your own mind

1658
01:43:39,601 --> 01:43:42,440
today. Yeah. Right.

1659
01:43:43,500 --> 01:43:45,210
And you can create,

1660
01:43:45,240 --> 01:43:50,240
even if externally you have all of
the material trappings or rewards of a

1661
01:43:51,651 --> 01:43:54,020
financially successful career.

1662
01:43:54,440 --> 01:43:59,440
If you have the nuclear family
that everyone has dreamed
of and painted a Norman

1663
01:44:00,500 --> 01:44:05,390
Rockwell paintings, if that inner
voice is just a demon on your back,

1664
01:44:06,020 --> 01:44:09,260
you will not find the piece that
you want and nothing you buy,

1665
01:44:11,090 --> 01:44:13,640
nothing you achieve will provide that.

1666
01:44:13,670 --> 01:44:16,760
There are just things you need to unpack
so that that voice becomes a different

1667
01:44:16,761 --> 01:44:21,670
voice. It is it fair to him
to say that part of love is a,

1668
01:44:21,980 --> 01:44:24,140
like you can love your
country without thinking.

1669
01:44:24,141 --> 01:44:28,850
It's perfect and you can love your kids
without thinking they're perfect and

1670
01:44:28,851 --> 01:44:32,600
part of like loving yourself is like
saying, that doesn't mean I'm perfect.

1671
01:44:32,630 --> 01:44:35,300
I'm not going to be
jingoistic about myself.

1672
01:44:35,750 --> 01:44:40,750
It's more about I'm going to hold myself
and hire enough regard that I'm going

1673
01:44:41,271 --> 01:44:45,560
to do the best I can with the day that
I have and I'm going to forgive myself

1674
01:44:45,561 --> 01:44:49,430
when I screw up, honestly.
Yeah, that's a big part of it.

1675
01:44:49,431 --> 01:44:52,610
And also for people who were looking
for maybe a tactical recommendation.

1676
01:44:52,611 --> 01:44:53,810
One thing I found very helpful,

1677
01:44:53,811 --> 01:44:56,000
and I do want to take too
much time to go into it,

1678
01:44:56,001 --> 01:45:00,950
but something called Metta Emmy TTA
meditation or loving kindness meditation.

1679
01:45:01,480 --> 01:45:03,380
I went through meditation
retreat recently,

1680
01:45:03,381 --> 01:45:08,120
which was very difficult for
me and I was practicing this.

1681
01:45:08,150 --> 01:45:11,420
Just Google it. You'll find plenty, uh,

1682
01:45:11,540 --> 01:45:16,540
to convey in my meditation love and
wishes for happiness to many different

1683
01:45:18,501 --> 01:45:19,850
people who had helped
me throughout my life.

1684
01:45:19,851 --> 01:45:22,940
And I remember one of the teachers
at the retreat said the very end,

1685
01:45:22,941 --> 01:45:24,650
I was about to walk out the door
and she said, wait a second,

1686
01:45:25,100 --> 01:45:30,100
have you done any loving kindness
to earlier versions of yourself who

1687
01:45:30,261 --> 01:45:33,050
experienced a lot of pain, who
maybe felt unsafe? And I was like,

1688
01:45:34,280 --> 01:45:36,380
didn't even occur to me to do that.

1689
01:45:36,980 --> 01:45:39,410
I would encourage everybody
here to accept Laura that,

1690
01:45:39,800 --> 01:45:41,660
and I know we're running out of time.
So Mike,

1691
01:45:41,661 --> 01:45:44,180
I have one more question and then
I'll have some closing thoughts.

1692
01:45:44,990 --> 01:45:49,010
This is the tradition at the forum to ask,

1693
01:45:49,880 --> 01:45:54,180
what is your 62nd idea
to change the world? Uh,

1694
01:45:54,750 --> 01:45:56,270
pressure.
Okay.

1695
01:45:57,620 --> 01:46:02,620
Think for yourself and be kind to yourself
in your own mind because 90% of the

1696
01:46:03,951 --> 01:46:07,550
unkindness that happens in the world
is actually people being unkind to

1697
01:46:07,551 --> 01:46:12,470
themselves. And if you're going to be,
if you set out to make the world better,

1698
01:46:12,471 --> 01:46:17,150
being kind to yourself in your own mind
is probably the most straight forward,

1699
01:46:17,151 --> 01:46:20,180
high return UC or time possible.

1700
01:46:21,710 --> 01:46:22,543
Cheers to that.

1701
01:46:23,370 --> 01:46:28,370
[inaudible] Mike,

1702
01:46:29,540 --> 01:46:31,280
I just want to say I that

1703
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:36,760
it's been such a joy and a privilege to
know you for as long as I have and uh,

1704
01:46:38,090 --> 01:46:39,950
I really hope to spend more time with you.
I mean,

1705
01:46:39,951 --> 01:46:40,970
we've spent a lot of time together,

1706
01:46:40,971 --> 01:46:45,680
but I'd like to spend more time and I
really truly believe in part of the reason

1707
01:46:45,681 --> 01:46:47,450
I wanted to bring you
out on stage tonight.

1708
01:46:48,160 --> 01:46:52,410
You're one of the most genuine unentitled

1709
01:46:54,030 --> 01:46:59,030
positive people who want to also impart
the gift of positivity to the world I've

1710
01:46:59,221 --> 01:47:02,610
ever met. So I just want to
thank you for that. Alright,

1711
01:47:02,640 --> 01:47:05,700
well it's been fun to see you
do so well. Well, you too man.

1712
01:47:06,540 --> 01:47:09,900
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mike Naples.

1713
01:47:21,630 --> 01:47:24,960
Hey guys, this is Tim again. Just a
few more things before you take off.

1714
01:47:25,320 --> 01:47:27,930
Number one,
this is five bullet Friday.

1715
01:47:28,260 --> 01:47:31,200
Do you want to get a short email from me?

1716
01:47:31,230 --> 01:47:35,370
Would you enjoy getting a short email
from me every Friday that provides a

1717
01:47:35,371 --> 01:47:39,330
little morsel of fun before the weekend
and five bullet Friday is a very short

1718
01:47:39,360 --> 01:47:43,860
email where I share the coolest things
I've found or that I've been pondering

1719
01:47:43,861 --> 01:47:47,580
over the week. That could include
favorite new albums that I've discovered.

1720
01:47:47,581 --> 01:47:51,030
It could include Gizmos and gadgets
and all sorts of weird shit that I've

1721
01:47:51,031 --> 01:47:55,350
somehow dug up in the other
world of the esoteric as I do.

1722
01:47:55,620 --> 01:48:00,620
It could include favorite articles that
I've read and that I've shared with my

1723
01:48:01,261 --> 01:48:03,990
close friends for instance,
and it's very short.

1724
01:48:04,080 --> 01:48:09,060
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness
before you head off for the weekend.

1725
01:48:09,150 --> 01:48:11,280
So if you want to receive that,
check it out.

1726
01:48:11,580 --> 01:48:16,230
Just go to four hour work week.com that's

1729

This episode is brought to you by
wordpress.com I love workflows.

01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:30,360
I have used it for so many years.

1731
01:48:30,361 --> 01:48:33,180
It's my go to platform for
blogging and creating websites.

1732
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:37,230
I use wordpress.com for
everything every day. My site,

1733
01:48:37,290 --> 01:48:42,150
tim.blog is built on it. The
website's for books, tools of titans,

1734
01:48:42,151 --> 01:48:47,040
tribe of mentors, all in wordpress.com
and the founder Matt Mullenweg.

1735
01:48:47,150 --> 01:48:50,220
One of my close friends has
appeared on the show many times.

1736
01:48:50,250 --> 01:48:54,120
Just search that Mall Tequila
Ferris for quite an exciting,

1740
01:49:07,321 --> 01:49:11,010
Beyonce, five 38 tech
crunch, Ted CNN time,

1741
01:49:11,011 --> 01:49:12,780
just to name a handful,

1742

the best out of the box SEO imaginable,
but,

1744
01:49:23,860 --> 01:49:28,440
and it's one of the many reasons that
nearly 30% of the Internet is run on

1745
01:49:28,441 --> 01:49:29,274
wordpress.

1746
01:49:29,580 --> 01:49:33,060
You do not need experience or to hire
someone that's perhaps the best part.

1747
01:49:33,510 --> 01:49:35,790
wordpress.com guide you
through the entire experience,

1748
01:49:35,791 --> 01:49:38,640

templates that you can use,

1749
01:49:39,360 --> 01:49:43,920
and it's easy to get started. There's no
need to worry about security upgrades,

1750
01:49:43,921 --> 01:49:48,310
boosting any of that they have for
24 seven support and they're very,

1751
01:49:48,311 --> 01:49:49,144
very responsive.

1752

amount of headache and friction.

1754
01:49:56,201 --> 01:49:58,330
So if you're building a website,
period,

1755
01:49:58,670 --> 01:50:01,390
when my friends come to
me and ask what I used,

1756
01:50:01,391 --> 01:50:06,220

Check it out. This episode is
brought to you by convert kit.

1763
01:50:29,470 --> 01:50:32,230
My go to email service provider.
I use them for everything.

1764
01:50:32,740 --> 01:50:35,440
If you've ever wondered how
professional bloggers, podcasters,

1765
01:50:35,441 --> 01:50:40,270
youtubers and so on can build a platform
they control and get the word out about

1766
01:50:40,271 --> 01:50:45,100
their best content. Email is still the
answer I, it's all social, social, social,

1767
01:50:45,370 --> 01:50:47,980
but one algorithm change and oops,
bait and switch.

1768
01:50:47,981 --> 01:50:49,690
Now you only reach 10% of your audience.

1769
01:50:49,990 --> 01:50:52,660
That is why I've doubled
and tripled down on email.

1770
01:50:53,260 --> 01:50:55,960
After reviewing many different
email service providers,

1771
01:50:55,961 --> 01:50:59,560
I ended up selecting convert
kit for like five bullet Friday,

1772
01:50:59,561 --> 01:51:03,940
which goes out to about a million people
now because convert kit delivers on

1773
01:51:03,941 --> 01:51:07,360
what matters most to me,
at least. Easy use systems,

1774
01:51:07,420 --> 01:51:10,990
split testing and resending
technology, both very, very important.

1775
01:51:11,320 --> 01:51:15,010
High rates of deliverability and
great hands on customer service.

1776
01:51:15,011 --> 01:51:17,200

business or simply have,

01:51:17,201 --> 01:51:21,910

integrations with more than 70 different

1778

1779
01:51:25,391 --> 01:51:28,210

1780
01:51:28,211 --> 01:51:31,180
technology of bounce exchange

1781
01:51:31,600 --> 01:51:35,320
They also offer a visual
automation builder that makes
it really easy to deliver

1782
01:51:35,321 --> 01:51:38,770

your audience, just what they want it.

1783
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:41,560

which a lot of people do,

1784
01:51:42,520 --> 01:51:45,250

a thousand people or 1 million on your

1786
01:51:49,210 --> 01:51:54,130

planning on growing and
growing and growing and I don't

1787
01:51:54,131 --> 01:51:55,840
like switching email service providers,

1788
01:51:55,841 --> 01:51:59,410
so I thought very carefully about
this before. It's like check it out.
