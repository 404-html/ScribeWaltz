1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,890
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02,891 --> 00:00:06,420
I can run flat out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking. It

3
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:15,560
like, to be honest, I'm a cybernetic
organism, living tissue yoga.

4
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:27,250
It is very late at night.
I am packing for an island to get away.

5
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:28,421
Why does that matter?

6
00:00:28,421 --> 00:00:33,070
Because it reminds me of one of the
sponsors for today's podcast Mizzen and

7
00:00:33,071 --> 00:00:36,640
main. Why? Because the only
dress shirt that I'm taking,

8
00:00:36,641 --> 00:00:39,700
I normally hate dress shirts
is from mizzen and main,

9
00:00:39,701 --> 00:00:42,250
specifically the Beckett Blue Gingham.

10
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:47,910
The reason or the reasons I should say
is because I can throw it in my bag in a

11
00:00:48,251 --> 00:00:50,380
duffle,
not worry about ironing,

12
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:54,490
not worry about any kind of wrinkling
and then throw it on where it maybe four

13
00:00:54,491 --> 00:00:58,090
or five nights out of seven
without washing it. It won't smell.

14
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,560
It's antimicrobial. It is
made of stretch, fabric,

15
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:04,870
sweat wicking,
athletic.

16
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,480
I could wear it for a hike in
between dinners if I want to do it,

17
00:01:07,481 --> 00:01:08,410
probably wouldn't do that,

18
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,920
but mizzen and main has really delivered
on the all around all purpose dress

19
00:01:14,711 --> 00:01:16,090
shirt.
They're fancy enough.

20
00:01:16,091 --> 00:01:19,780
You can fool people into thinking
that you had them custom tailored,

21
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:24,520
but they're also rough
enough and resilient enough
that you can toss them into

22
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:26,350
the bottom of a duffle bag or backpack,

23
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:31,470
pull it off and put it on in
a bathroom at a restaurant.

24
00:01:31,931 --> 00:01:35,800
Let's say. Uh, hundreds of pro
athletes love this brand. Uh,

25
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:40,420
people who don't fit well into dress
shirts, otherwise like NFL allpro JJ watt.

26
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,810
And the last time these guys
were featured on the show,

27
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,270
Mizzen and main sold out of
every item that they featured.

28
00:01:46,271 --> 00:01:50,110
So if you're interested in checking
them out, I'd recommend taking a look.

29
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:55,111
Just go to tim.blog/shirts and you can
see that one shirt that I'm packing that

30
00:01:55,841 --> 00:02:00,310
I always pack the Becket Blue Gingham
in addition to a couple of my other

31
00:02:00,311 --> 00:02:02,710
favorites.
And you can enter Tim,

32
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,620
that's Capitol Tim at
checkout for free shipping.

33
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,250
If you use this code
before September 15th,

34
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:12,520
that's 2017 to buy a dress
shirt mizzen and main,

35
00:02:12,521 --> 00:02:16,840
we'll donate a brand new dress shirt to
the relief efforts in southern Texas.

36
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:21,580
That's in addition to the thousand shirts
that are already being donated through

37
00:02:21,581 --> 00:02:23,380
Jj Watson.
Credible efforts to put,

38
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:27,400
or I should say rather help Houston and
the surrounding communities get back on

39
00:02:27,401 --> 00:02:30,130
their feet. So there you have
it. Check it out. Take a look.

40
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,530
Even if it's just to take a peek at
this one shirt, the Becket Tim dot.

41
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:39,910
Blog forward slash shirts. Again, that's
Tim dot. Blog forward slash shirts.

42
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,280
This episode is brought
to you by kettle and fire,

43
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:49,420
which makes some of the best bone broth
and certainly the most convenient that

44
00:02:49,421 --> 00:02:54,421
I've ever found and I have a big stack
of them on my kitchen counter right now.

45
00:02:54,551 --> 00:02:59,551
I have one container every morning and
this first came recommended to me by past

46
00:03:01,001 --> 00:03:02,860
podcast guests such as Amelia Boone,

47
00:03:02,861 --> 00:03:06,250
who is a four time world champion in
world's toughest mudder, Spartan race,

48
00:03:06,251 --> 00:03:11,080
etc. And Dr Dominic D'agostino, the
incredible hulk of scientific research.

49
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:12,250
You check him out too.

50
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,120
But there are a few things that make
kettle and fire special. Number one,

51
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,430
they are the first shelf stable.
In other words,

52
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:22,240
never frozen bone broth that
uses bones from 100% grass fed,

53
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:26,890
organically raised animals,
so you are what you eat,

54
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,810
ate,
if that makes sense.

55
00:03:28,811 --> 00:03:31,810
So it's very important that you understand
if you're consuming animal protein,

56
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:36,280
what they consumed. They also use
longer cook times, 20 plus hours,

57
00:03:36,281 --> 00:03:39,340
which means more collagen and
other nutrients. For instance,

58
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:42,700
they contain 19 times more Collagen,

59
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:47,350
then one of their close competitors
and an independent lab confirm this.

60
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,890
I'll leave the competitor's name out
of it because I don't want to get sued,

61
00:03:50,891 --> 00:03:54,250
but that's the case and it is not frozen.

62
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,100
So thanks to many millions of
dollars of packaging equipment.

63
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,630
Their bone broth doesn't require
freezing or shipping with dry ice.

64
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,261
So like I said,

65
00:04:02,261 --> 00:04:06,190
it's just sitting on my kitchen counter
in these boxes and then I can heat them

66
00:04:06,191 --> 00:04:07,450
up.
They're basically ready to drink,

67
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:12,010
heat them up on the stove top or in a
microwave and you are ready to rock and

68
00:04:12,011 --> 00:04:16,600
roll. And you'll also get a nice
payload of Glucosamine, glycine, uh,

69
00:04:16,601 --> 00:04:20,950
along with the Dalton and everything
else that I mentioned. So check it out.

70
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:24,510
I've been hugely pleased
with this and like I said,

71
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,340
had been consuming it every morning.
It gives you about,

72
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,960
I want to say 20 grams of protein,

73
00:04:28,961 --> 00:04:32,460
which is a nice little slow carb diet
boost if that's what you're looking for.

74
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,970
Then I'll typically sip this Advate,

75
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:38,990
very large camping coffee Mug as
I do some writing or journaling,

76
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,240
so you'll have it. Check
it out. It's delicious.

77
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:46,930
I favor the chicken,
but uh,

78
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,650
each to his own or her own.
So check it out.

this is Tim Ferriss.

82
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:09,280
Welcome to another episode of the Tim
Ferriss show. I have music on the mind.

83
00:05:09,281 --> 00:05:12,490
It's a Friday as I record this pet,
way too much tea,

84
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:15,280
and that gives me a little bit of
personality. So let's jump into it.

85
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:20,281
This episode of the podcast features
Stuart Copeland on Twitter at Copeland

86
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:25,450
music who is considered one of
the top 10 drummers of all times.

87
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:27,940
Certainly one of the greatest
drummers in rock and roll history.

88
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,820
He was one of the founding
members of the police,

89
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:34,150
has been inducted into the rock and
roll hall of fame and is a grammy award

90
00:05:34,151 --> 00:05:38,730
winning musician. Stuart is
amazing. I've spent time with him.

91
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:43,440
He reminds me a bit of
doc in back to the future.

92
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:47,760
It show kids Mati it chuck
kids. But uh, I digress.

93
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,090
He is a fantastic storyteller and a very,

94
00:05:51,091 --> 00:05:55,770
very well spoken smart guy in this
conversation, which is very wide ranging.

95
00:05:55,771 --> 00:06:00,650
We delve into early lessons in surviving
and how to survive the music industry,

96
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:03,050
why entrepreneurs never get a day off.

97
00:06:03,051 --> 00:06:08,051
And certainly any self directed musicians
or creatives are entrepreneurs in the

98
00:06:08,651 --> 00:06:12,940
sense of him, but in dead to
make something from nothing.

99
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:17,500
How the police developed a unique sound
and the decision that changed everything

100
00:06:17,501 --> 00:06:19,630
for them and much more.

101
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:24,250
This interview comes from my
television show. Fearless fear, less,

102
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,820
less in quotation marks.
Since your goal is not to be fearless,

103
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:29,110
but to learn to fear less.

104
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,700
And in this show I interviewed world class
performers on stage about how they've

105
00:06:33,701 --> 00:06:37,240
overcome doubt, conquered fear,
and made their toughest decisions.

106
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:41,230
We recorded about three hours of material,
only one was used for the TV show.

107
00:06:41,231 --> 00:06:45,880
So this podcast is almost entirely
new content that did not appear on TV,

108
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,820
but I highly recommend a few things.
Number one,

109
00:06:48,821 --> 00:06:53,821
you can watch the entire first episode
of fearless with illusionist and

110
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:57,820
endurance artists, David Blaine,
and he does a bunch on stage.

111
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:02,440
You can wash it all for
free@att.net forward slash fearless,

112
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:06,580
all spelled out, no parentheses.
So att.net forward slash fearless.

113
00:07:06,581 --> 00:07:10,360
So definitely check that out. And to
see all episodes of this new TV show,

114
00:07:10,361 --> 00:07:15,361
you can use directv or you can use the
APP at direct TV that Com and that's

115
00:07:18,351 --> 00:07:20,300
direct TV now.
So you can check that out.

116
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:25,330
D I r e c t v.com and that is it for now.

117
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:26,840
So let's move on.

118
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,630
Please enjoy this conversation with
the one and only Stewart Copeland.

119
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:36,700
You want to fearless? I'm
your host, Tim Ferris.

120
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:40,270
And on this stage will be deconstructing
world class performers of all different

121
00:07:40,271 --> 00:07:43,660
types to uncover the specific
tactics they've used, overcome doubt,

122
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:45,550
tackle some of their hardest decisions,

123
00:07:45,551 --> 00:07:48,160
and ultimately succeed on their own terms.

124
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,610
So imagine yourself a founding member
of one of the most successful rock bands

125
00:07:51,611 --> 00:07:54,790
of all time.
What happens when you break up from any,

126
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,860
that might be the end of the story,
but from my guest tonight,

127
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:59,740
it was just getting started
with no prior experience.

128
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:03,490
He went on to score films for Francis
Ford Coppola and Oliver Stone composed for

129
00:08:03,491 --> 00:08:08,020
ballet and opera and even take pilgrimages
to Africa where he played drums with

130
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:11,590
hungry lions. I am not kidding. He's
a founding member of the police,

131
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,390
a member of the rock
and Roll Hall of fame.

132
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:17,560
And for the last three decades he's been
one of rolling stone's top 10 drummers

133
00:08:17,561 --> 00:08:18,430
of all time.

134
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:22,990
Please welcome musician master
and Madman Stewart Copeland

135
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:28,380
[inaudible].

136
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,480
So just,
uh,

137
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:41,960
we're going to get to the
backstory because I was
kidding with some of the guys

138
00:08:41,961 --> 00:08:46,370
when we were doing all the research that
if I wrote a screenplay that covered

139
00:08:46,371 --> 00:08:47,600
the arc of your life,

140
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:53,050
I think it would get rejected or
heavily edit as being too unrealistic.

141
00:08:53,181 --> 00:08:55,980
We're going to get to that. It's just
a fascinating story, but what was

142
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,560
your mother's background?
Well, she's British.

143
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:04,140
Her job was analyzing French and European
train schedules and so it was very,

144
00:09:04,481 --> 00:09:06,550
if she was a spy,
but it was in an office,

145
00:09:06,551 --> 00:09:11,551
it was a bureaucratic version of analyzing
says for sorting out bombing runs,

146
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,120
getting supplies.

147
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:17,200
And it was called the Soe and the ladies
of the Soa as almost all women by the

148
00:09:17,201 --> 00:09:20,470
way, unsung heroes and people are
now writing books about the Soa,

149
00:09:20,471 --> 00:09:25,471
these women who fought this kind of
bureaucratic data war and now data,

150
00:09:27,251 --> 00:09:30,760
we all understand data. But back then
it was kind of number NCU met my father.

151
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:35,890
They got married during the war and um,
that's my parents.

152
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,660
She's a bitch. She,
when we went to Lebanon,

153
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:42,550
she was an archeologist and she
wrote books. In fact, my mother,

154
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:47,020
a very bookish and her books are the
kind of books that you don't read in a

155
00:09:47,021 --> 00:09:51,010
bookstore. The kind of books that the
people who write books that you read,

156
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:54,970
use those research. The first
word in her book, you know,

157
00:09:54,971 --> 00:09:59,500
one of our books is the second
word is 14 syllables. Log

158
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,580
started off easy. Yeah,
yeah. It's fine. Not Great.

159
00:10:03,581 --> 00:10:05,920
But then it gets more and more
impenetrable as you go into it.

160
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:11,820
What was it like growing up as the
American in Cairo or in Beirut?

161
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:16,240
While there were other Americans
to mostly oil families.

162
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:21,200
All of the kids at the American community
school of Beirut, a rumored to, uh,

163
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,950
the American community schools,
all the Aramco kids,

164
00:10:23,951 --> 00:10:27,340
all the families in Saudi Arabia,
the American families around,

165
00:10:27,341 --> 00:10:29,800
they sent their kids to
this school in Beirut.

166
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:34,780
And in my generation was
the first generation where
the Saudi Arabians and the

167
00:10:34,781 --> 00:10:39,490
Gulf Arabs with their new wealth
began to send their kids for a western

168
00:10:39,491 --> 00:10:40,324
education.

169
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:45,540
And so I in my age group started to see
Saudi princes in my class and got to

170
00:10:46,481 --> 00:10:47,260
know them.

171
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:51,490
A one such was Osama
bin Ladin in your class?

172
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,850
Not In my class. He would
have been a quite a big in
your school and that school.

173
00:10:54,851 --> 00:10:57,040
Quite a few. If I had known him,
I would have kicked his ass.

174
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,200
Yeah.

175
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,810
Well, I mean I have to ask, did
you, so you met and interacted
with them? No, no, no.

176
00:11:07,811 --> 00:11:12,130
He was years after. Right after I got
it and I got it. What, by the way? Yes.

177
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,960
I went back to Beirut years later.
Um,

178
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:18,160
and it's all Arabic mouth and
they're all there. The Lebanese,

179
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:20,100
the most murky there.
One of the richest countries,

180
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,590
most developed countries in the Middle
East and they rule in the Arab world.

181
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:27,970
Anybody who's running any
of these probably Lebanese
and they have no resources.

182
00:11:27,971 --> 00:11:31,090
They have huge civil strife,
huge ethnic tension.

183
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:35,020
But they've been through their civil war
and they've got it resolved in just the

184
00:11:35,021 --> 00:11:38,170
Lebanese.
They are all about education.

185
00:11:38,171 --> 00:11:42,550
So the American community school educating
these kids to go and conquer America,

186
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,440
which they do. You know, there's
a Lebanese ghetto here in, uh,

187
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,190
Los Angeles is called Beverly Hills.

188
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,710
What did, what did you want
to be when you were a kid?

189
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:01,773
I,

190
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:07,530
I can't remember any time before I
wasn't a musician and I don't remember,

191
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,890
you know, was seven or something
like that. I just never, ever,

192
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:15,850
when I was actually in college, I thought,
I don't actually want to play music.

193
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,360
I want to organize it. So I, you know,

194
00:12:18,361 --> 00:12:23,361
I studied journalism and other
aspects of the entertainment industry,

195
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:28,330
but the drums just kept
the siren song me back.

196
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:33,760
When did you leave the Middle
East? I left the Middle East, uh,

197
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:38,620
and the mid sixties,
I would have been 14 or 15,

198
00:12:38,621 --> 00:12:39,221
something like that.

199
00:12:39,221 --> 00:12:42,070
And I was already playing in my high
school band and Beirut by that time.

200
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:46,930
And I got to boarding school in England
and a couple of things nobody had ever

201
00:12:46,931 --> 00:12:51,700
heard of where I come from. Where do
you come from? Well, Lebanon. Well,

202
00:12:51,701 --> 00:12:55,690
where's that, you know, uh, the other
thing was that I didn't realize it,

203
00:12:55,691 --> 00:13:00,150
but a lot of my vocabulary wasn't
English. Uh, they speak in Beirut,

204
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:05,020
they speak Arab, a friend
glaze, which is the Arabic,

205
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:08,950
but the sophisticated bay,
Rudy's speak French, but English,

206
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,640
English American was invading
the university was American.

207
00:13:12,641 --> 00:13:15,820
The hospital built by
American missionaries, the
Americans in the Middle East,

208
00:13:15,821 --> 00:13:18,640
by the way, during my time
where most part from my father,

209
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:23,980
the Americans built hospitals
and universities and
American money was going into

210
00:13:23,981 --> 00:13:28,720
the Middle East from Christian
organizations, um, for missionaries.

211
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:33,910
And so Americans were known for
no strings attached. Good stuff,

212
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:35,260
you know,

213
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:39,460
because it was the French and the British
and the old emperor imperial powers

214
00:13:39,461 --> 00:13:42,250
that had the bad rap.
We soon earned a bad rap.

215
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:46,240
But in those days the
Americans were much loved.

216
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:51,580
What brought you to even, why'd you guys
move? Well, I was evacuated because,

217
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:55,150
uh, after the Philby
thing, it got hot. And uh,

218
00:13:55,151 --> 00:13:59,820
so my father just suddenly had to
get the family out of dodge. Um,

219
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,980
Lebanon at that time was
always, you know, 1958.

220
00:14:02,981 --> 00:14:05,950
There was a civil war there at
that time while I was there.

221
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,750
And it was bombs in the night.

222
00:14:07,751 --> 00:14:11,860
We had to fill the bathtub with water
and stock up with food and, and so on.

223
00:14:11,861 --> 00:14:14,680
And there was sand bags in
the streets. And uh, uh,

224
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,190
and I actually in those days it
was put out by the United States,

225
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:21,100
Sixth Fleet show up, which is another
reason I was real proud to be American.

226
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:23,260
They showed up in 1958,

227
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:27,700
I think Eisenhower was president
and that was it. Civil war over,

228
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:29,650
uh, they, they just,

229
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:34,180
just for show they landed a whole
platoon or whatever on the beach with the

230
00:14:34,181 --> 00:14:37,560
tanks and everything and did a
display of these enormous 10,

231
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:43,210
okay, well let's all go back to
work now, shall we? You know,

232
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:45,730
and there was no violence to I,
it was just a display.

233
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:48,400
It was like a 4th of July
exhibition kind of thing.

234
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,200
These are the kind of toys
we got to play with folks.

235
00:14:51,201 --> 00:14:54,480
Anybody who has any questions and,
uh,

236
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:58,270
because our, as I said
before, because our,

237
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:02,720
our status there was very positive.
We were loved there that we, you know,

238
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:05,740
and they, they're, there was an
election coming up and they're very,

239
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:10,040
I won't bore you with the complicated
politics, but there was a,

240
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:12,050
an election coming up and
there's a lot of vegetation.

241
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:17,240
And so the American showed up.
They have a peaceful election.

242
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:21,200
They elected the, not the, not American
guy, actually, the, you know, they,

243
00:15:21,201 --> 00:15:23,060
my father was glad,

244
00:15:23,061 --> 00:15:26,300
but they elected Shahab instead of
the guy that the Americans wanted.

245
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:31,160
But it was fine. He did a fine job and
civil war over, but it was always there.

246
00:15:31,161 --> 00:15:36,161
There had three major religions there
who had to share power and the Christian

247
00:15:36,271 --> 00:15:38,390
has ruled the country.
Uh,

248
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:42,830
then there's the Sunni and the Shia who
were at each other's throats as much.

249
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:45,390
They all, you know, is
a triangle. And, um,

250
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:50,890
that triangle with the influx of
Palestinians just couldn't hold.

251
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:57,220
And so civil war and then there were
the really awful civil wars, you know,

252
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,090
the same as what's going on in Syria now.

253
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:02,360
They eventually blew over and in Beirut,

254
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:07,780
Lebanon has probably more
able to withstand the Syrian
war next door because in

255
00:16:08,481 --> 00:16:12,920
Lebanon, no, no, no, no, no. We've been,
there were not that Sunni's are fine.

256
00:16:12,921 --> 00:16:15,230
The shear fine law lets every,
you know,

257
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:19,730
everybody gets to go back to work instead
of the u s six leaks showing up the

258
00:16:19,731 --> 00:16:22,100
civil war,
the civil war in Syria next door.

259
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:25,480
And their own history means they're not
about to pick a fight anytime soon. Yeah.

260
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:30,530
But before I was born in Syria where
the family was living before I was born

261
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:34,160
there, my mother was pregnant
with my brother, Ian, uh,

262
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,990
comes up in conversation a lot.
Um,

263
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:42,100
and they had a problem with their
general, who is they, you know,

264
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:44,900
their dictator who was
running the place of Fauzi,

265
00:16:44,901 --> 00:16:48,590
Al Shabaab or whatever his name was.
And he was, you know, starting to get,

266
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,420
starting to talk to the
root skis and so on.

267
00:16:50,421 --> 00:16:53,930
And so you got to get rid of this guy.
And so they figured out,

268
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:56,870
this is my father's idea that I tell you
what, why don't we have a rent a mob?

269
00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:02,050
Go and attack an American diplomats
house or rent them up hours.

270
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:06,480
Uh, and so, uh, and
then then the, uh, our,

271
00:17:06,481 --> 00:17:08,420
our new kernel that we'd been shining up,

272
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:13,100
he can get the soldiers out to go and
put down this riot and Wallace soldiers

273
00:17:13,101 --> 00:17:15,770
around and they can take over
the radio station and the palace.

274
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,230
And that's how they did it in those days.

275
00:17:18,231 --> 00:17:21,830
And he be colonel who
took over the palace,

276
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:25,340
thought he was working
against American interests,

277
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:30,520
but in fact the other colonel Heather
to undisclosed with the actual guy.

278
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:36,110
And so his system was getting other
people to do the dirty work. But okay.

279
00:17:36,111 --> 00:17:40,790
So this attack happens on the family home,
the Copeland family home in Damascus,

280
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:42,230
Syria and a,

281
00:17:42,231 --> 00:17:45,620
they're late at my father's on the phone
to bay route and they show up. Oh, great,

282
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:49,790
great. Go Bang. Oh No, they got god.
That's not, you know, and Bang Bang.

283
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:54,210
And the famous line that he had,
which is as our family thing is, uh,

284
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,950
he says, ah, I'm going to have to hang
up now they're shooting at me personally.

285
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,000
No,

286
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,290
I never even believed these stories. Uh,
because it was my bad pellet. I mean,

287
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:12,020
he used to say,
never let the facts ruin a good story,

288
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:16,310
but the history books are being
written now about that period.

289
00:18:16,311 --> 00:18:20,990
And my father's in there, oh my
God. And according to the books,

290
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:25,800
and I didn't realize this until I
found in the family archives, uh, some,

291
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:30,530
uh, uh, newspaper clippings about
it. He chased them off with a gun.

292
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,110
He had a gun.
My father had a handgun.

293
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:36,290
I never saw him with a gun or a he,
you know,

294
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:40,190
Alabama kid chases up bandits
with a handgun. And, uh,

295
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:43,880
there were in one of the Persian
rugs there, bullet holes.

296
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:47,540
And my sister's got that rug,
uh, because during those days,

297
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:52,541
the diplomatic wives and all the wives
would go to Iran or Persia as it was

298
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:55,070
known.
And by all this incredible stuff.

299
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:59,270
So I have in my studio these Persian
rugs that are older than I am.

300
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:02,330
They've been in the family
longer than I am. And in fact,

301
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,520
another little digression, the patterns
on those Persian rugs, but these strange,

302
00:19:06,521 --> 00:19:10,340
the geometric and yet curved
lines and everything like that.

303
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:15,350
And now I was crawling around face first
on those rugs from the age of zero all

304
00:19:15,351 --> 00:19:16,070
the way up.

305
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:20,990
And I just looked at those rugs the other
day and I realized that pattern is my

306
00:19:20,991 --> 00:19:25,490
music,
that my music is exactly that.

307
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:30,730
The way it's a combination of symmetry
and wild abandon the way the different

308
00:19:31,821 --> 00:19:32,900
colors interact with the other.

309
00:19:32,901 --> 00:19:36,950
I realize it was like printed when I
was nose first phase first and these

310
00:19:36,951 --> 00:19:39,460
Persian rugs.
So I'm going to,

311
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:41,600
I'm going to dial this back
a little bit to college.

312
00:19:41,601 --> 00:19:44,570
How did you choose where to go to college?
How did you end up going where he did?

313
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:48,620
Ah, well, I was a draftable American.

314
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:52,760
Uh,
in spite of my pride in my country,

315
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:57,020
we were fighting a war in Vietnam
at the time for which my brother had

316
00:19:57,021 --> 00:20:00,080
volunteered. My brother Ian,
the heroic brother, actually,

317
00:20:00,081 --> 00:20:03,290
not only did he have a motorcycle in
high school, but he went to Vietnam.

318
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:07,340
He volunteered, he came
back, a decorated hero. Um,

319
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,960
[inaudible]

320
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:16,720
I, you know, I can't, you know, battalion
citation, presidential citation,

321
00:20:16,721 --> 00:20:21,420
purple heart, bronze star of
he found himself, you know,

322
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:24,820
and he came back and became an agent.
Never saw a gun for the rest of his life,

323
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:28,630
but he started,
he was a wild kid who discovered that.

324
00:20:28,631 --> 00:20:31,660
And he came back and when he came back,
he was spat on and reviled.

325
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,190
And it was a tragedy of the Vietnam War.

326
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:39,280
How the American people saw it because
we were afraid that we could be sent out.

327
00:20:39,281 --> 00:20:43,120
Well, the voluntary, those
weren't volunteers over
there. That could be me. Uh,

328
00:20:43,121 --> 00:20:47,470
and he did volunteered and
he was fine until the war,

329
00:20:47,471 --> 00:20:51,130
the first Gulf War. And when he heard the
crackle of the radios, the thump, thump,

330
00:20:51,131 --> 00:20:55,390
thump, thump of the helicopters,
it came back and it, it almost,

331
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,310
he had a psychosis for it.

332
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:00,880
And then when the soldiers came home
as conquering heroes, he, you know,

333
00:21:00,881 --> 00:21:03,460
that was the, that's what, how
he should have been treated.

334
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:08,550
Every single one of the soldiers in
his platoon ended up as heroin addicts.

335
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:11,170
They didn't make it,
none of them made it.

336
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,050
He died of Agent Orange a few years ago,

337
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:19,690
taken by melanoma. That's how the
Vietnam War generation was treated.

338
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:23,140
Um, and I didn't want any
part of that personally.

339
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:28,030
And by the time I came along, I'm,
I'm at the end of the baby boom. Um,

340
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,050
and by the time I got to college,
there were planting,

341
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:34,910
they built all these colleges and
capacity for the baby boom. Well,

342
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,940
at the time I came along and
would kind of wait it out of it.

343
00:21:36,941 --> 00:21:40,210
So it was easy for me to get into college.
You know, there's all this space. Uh,

344
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:43,240
but how the hell did we get there?

345
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,920
How did you end up going to college? How
am I going to go and cut? Okay. So, uh,

346
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,340
we had a lottery system.
Everybody, senator's kids,

347
00:21:51,341 --> 00:21:54,970
everybody was getting drafted
and so they had a lottery system.

348
00:21:54,971 --> 00:21:57,590
Whatever your birth date, you'd
take your date out of, uh,

349
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:02,740
they pull the dates out of
a hat. Okay. September 27,
that's one. Okay. January 18,

350
00:22:02,741 --> 00:22:05,290
that's two. Okay. April
nine, that's three.

351
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:07,780
And you go down to all
the 365 days of the year.

352
00:22:07,781 --> 00:22:12,370
And you get a number of mine was July 16
and depending on what state you are in,

353
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:17,020
um, they had a quota. Alabama had a quota
of [inaudible]. And if you're in a, an a,

354
00:22:17,021 --> 00:22:22,021
an Alabama and you registered to vote
in Alabama and you're a number was a 47

355
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:27,070
year drafted. If your number
was high, 200 or above,

356
00:22:27,071 --> 00:22:28,360
you're probably safe.
Well,

357
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:33,390
the draft board for people who turned
18 outside of America was zero.

358
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:37,240
They had a quota of zero.
So as long as they didn't come to America,

359
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:41,530
I was legally not drafted. I
registered and I, and everything.

360
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:45,640
But then I got my number 287,

361
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,980
uh,
and then it will say,

362
00:22:47,981 --> 00:22:52,840
so then I continued my university
education in America, Berkeley,

363
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,890
Berkeley, Berkeley. Why did
you choose Berkeley? Um,

364
00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:00,880
because I'd outgrown the small school
that I was at and I want it to go to a big

365
00:23:00,881 --> 00:23:04,930
school with 40,000 students
and learn from, uh, you know,

366
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:10,120
Nobel winners and so on.
Just felt like a bigger battery place.

367
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:14,700
It's a great school and they're in
my backyard. Uh, tell, tell me about,

368
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,520
and tell us about the, uh, the
college event. Set the tip sheet.

369
00:23:18,521 --> 00:23:20,140
They've now you're getting,
okay,

370
00:23:20,141 --> 00:23:23,920
now you have found a question for which
I ain't going to have to make up material

371
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:29,650
and it's true. I've been trying, don't,
I don't mean by, by, by making it up.

372
00:23:29,651 --> 00:23:33,430
I mean like that's a question I've never
answered before. Alright, Mazel Tov.

373
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:37,150
Thank you. Ah, college event
was an idea of my older brother,

374
00:23:37,151 --> 00:23:42,130
miles who was the, the, uh, the
businessman of the family. And,

375
00:23:42,131 --> 00:23:46,190
um, basically I called up all the
colleges around the west and I said,

376
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:49,100
tell me about what concerts do you put on?
How much did you spend Frank Zappa,

377
00:23:49,101 --> 00:23:52,550
how much did he cost Janice Joplin? How
much did he pay? How'd they go down?

378
00:23:52,551 --> 00:23:53,640
How did the thick of it?

379
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:58,220
And they just send me back their report
of the Gig and I printed it onto what

380
00:23:58,221 --> 00:24:02,330
was called a tip sheet. Um, it
just information, just data.

381
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:06,470
And I would send it to all the colleges
and the West so they can see the,

382
00:24:06,471 --> 00:24:11,240
you know, Uc Santa Barbara can
see that UCLA paid Frank Zappa,

383
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,530
you know, $10,000. They trashed
the dressing rooms or whatever.

384
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:19,250
And so the colleges could
use this as a data sheet.

385
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:23,630
And I sold advertising to the record
companies and so on and so forth.

386
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,520
And I was a little business venture.
And then that drumming,

387
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:32,360
it was just while I was into
my second or third edition,

388
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,580
and then I'd call it calling up,

389
00:24:34,581 --> 00:24:37,130
selling the stuff and getting the
letters and the college people sent.

390
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:41,870
All I had to do is print their letters
about what agent rip them off and didn't

391
00:24:41,871 --> 00:24:44,900
treat them on that agent.
The guy who deals with universities,

392
00:24:44,901 --> 00:24:48,830
they have a lot of money. These colleges.
Oh my God. And so suddenly I had power,

393
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:54,560
power, but it was all going
great until that drumming thing.

394
00:24:54,561 --> 00:24:58,120
And there was a band over in London,
needed a drummer and it was summers.

395
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:01,160
I went over to the London plan,
a band and it never came back.

396
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,280
What was the,
uh,

397
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:09,320
what were the most important lessons
that you took from putting together that

398
00:25:09,321 --> 00:25:11,530
tip sheet?
Uh,

399
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:17,290
that you have to do it
yourself was the main thing.

400
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,060
And you have to think of everything.

401
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:23,270
And there's the entrepreneur,

402
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:28,100
unlike a job holder doesn't get
a day off. And My, you know,

403
00:25:28,101 --> 00:25:30,950
a roommate, you know, people
in the, in the building,

404
00:25:30,951 --> 00:25:35,150
they had jobs and they knew when they
go to work and they knew when they come

405
00:25:35,151 --> 00:25:39,320
home and they got their check, but
they have to go to work. I didn't,

406
00:25:39,321 --> 00:25:43,130
as an entrepreneur, you don't have
to go to work. You're always working.

407
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,540
You can never not be at work.
And so you know, of my sins,

408
00:25:47,541 --> 00:25:51,680
I have seven children and my
sons, you know, for instance,

409
00:25:51,681 --> 00:25:55,640
just take two for instance, one as an
entrepreneur, filmmaker has a band,

410
00:25:55,641 --> 00:25:58,610
he's just,
he's always picking up the phone,

411
00:25:58,611 --> 00:26:01,670
he's hustle bustle and the
other has a nine to five job.

412
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:06,560
They are both happy as clams. The nine to
fiver, he can't imagine what it's like.

413
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,520
And six o'clock he gets into his car,
he is free.

414
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:14,900
His life just as it belongs to him.
He can watch TV,

415
00:26:14,901 --> 00:26:18,320
you can have friends and go out to dinner.
He just lives a great life.

416
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,560
Next morning he gets up, goes to work.
Work's like hell, enjoys his job.

417
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:25,970
And then Jordan, he, he would not be
able to thrive under those conditions.

418
00:26:25,971 --> 00:26:29,810
And what do you mean? I have
to get up? You know, uh,

419
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:34,480
it's more of a question. No, no,
no, you can't go to bed. Right.

420
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,740
I remember being told once,
I said,

421
00:26:36,741 --> 00:26:40,430
if you work diligently eight
hours a day for perhaps 10 years,

422
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,730
then you can get promoted to boss
and work 12 hours. Yes, exactly.

423
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:52,830
When the punk bands in London in 1977
desired to play reggae because it was,

424
00:26:54,751 --> 00:26:58,650
you know, for, for a punk bands, the
only form of chill was dub reggae,

425
00:26:58,651 --> 00:27:02,610
which is still hostile.
Still pissed off,

426
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,193
but chill.

427
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:10,350
And so there was no such thing as chill
punk music. You just can't slow it down.

428
00:27:10,351 --> 00:27:15,330
And you know, and so the, the,
the, the, the punk rockers
would chill to dub reggae,

429
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:19,620
which meant that I could fall right into
that top or heat. And to his credit,

430
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:23,280
he figured out, let's see, the
backbeat doesn't go on two and four,

431
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,080
so he's sitting there and his drums
and he's signaling and then that,

432
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:29,910
and he had to learn how to
do it and he could do it.

433
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,310
I already can do it.

434
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:37,500
And so we develop that sound and the
police, which is kind of important.

435
00:27:37,501 --> 00:27:40,990
And we didn't actually play reggae
strictly the way it comes out of Jamaica.

436
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:44,430
We did our own thing to it,
but it was elemental.

437
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,220
It wasn't learning it
the way topper had do.

438
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:51,270
It just was that secret weapon that
I got from my friends in Lebanon.

439
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:57,880
So I call Stinko and I say Sony, he
wants to join the band. He's like fancy.

440
00:27:57,890 --> 00:28:01,040
He's in, that's said no brainer
water. You went, why, why, what?

441
00:28:01,041 --> 00:28:03,880
What are we waiting for? And I
think, Dude, calm down, calm down.

442
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:07,180
We can't afford him. He's a, you know,

443
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:11,710
I had to explain to Andy, there's no
record company. I'm the record company,

444
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:14,170
you know, illegal records. You know,

445
00:28:14,171 --> 00:28:17,830
I printed them myself staying and I put
the records into the bags ourselves and

446
00:28:17,831 --> 00:28:21,550
I would let lecherous I did the artwork
myself and I called up the stores.

447
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:24,730
My son, we got, I'm the
record company management.

448
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:28,240
I'm the manager to an agent.

449
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:33,460
I'm booking the gigs to roadie.
That's you.

450
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,750
And uh, so we, you know,
I, I'm really flattered,

451
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,450
but you're going to leave after two weeks,
you know, we can't, you know, you're,

452
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:46,000
you know, you've got a life,
you've got the expenses, you
know. Um, and he insisted.

453
00:28:46,001 --> 00:28:49,570
He said, no, no, no. I'm canning all
my sessions. I want to be in the band.

454
00:28:49,571 --> 00:28:54,180
He had played with soft machine or
burden, uh, the animals. You know,

455
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,260
he had a list of credits
as long as your arm,

456
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:01,120
but you didn't want to be a side man
anywhere to be in the band and to be for

457
00:29:01,121 --> 00:29:02,410
the band,
to be his band.

458
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,380
And of course I'm going to get rid of
that other guitars, you know that, right?

459
00:29:05,381 --> 00:29:08,090
And I say, sure, sure sir. I
didn't think about that. Um,

460
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,980
and we actually did play a couple
of shows with two guitars, but, um,

461
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:18,010
so he insisted and so, and, and
by this time thing going up, no,

462
00:29:18,011 --> 00:29:22,750
he's an actual musician. He's in the
back not going to calm down. And finally,

463
00:29:22,751 --> 00:29:27,090
you know, it's either, either
he's in or I'm out. Oh, okay.

464
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,660
So,
and he's in the band.

465
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:32,800
And immediately Andy has
deep musical training.

466
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:36,450
I didn't have to show them an
e chord or a d or an a chord.

467
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:40,260
He knows he flattens seventh
carry the, you know, you know,

468
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:45,430
he really, and as soon as him and
sting put their heads together,

469
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:50,290
out of nowhere, sting writes a song
as a result of Andi joining the group.

470
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:54,800
There was another surprise in
store for us all, which was the,

471
00:29:54,801 --> 00:29:59,530
in our punk band, the singing
was, ah, Dah and thinking do that.

472
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:02,910
And that's all I ever heard him do because
that's what we did. And that kind of,

473
00:30:02,911 --> 00:30:06,390
that genre was all shouting. Yeah. Um,

474
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:10,360
but we had one last Andy Summers Gig to
do. He said, look, I've got one last Gig,

475
00:30:10,361 --> 00:30:13,450
this guy in Germany and I'm going to
go over and by way he needs a drummer.

476
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:18,160
So you got a Gig to so dandy and I went
over to Germany with Everhard Sherner

477
00:30:18,161 --> 00:30:22,020
this high concept thing where he's
got jazz saxophone, he's gotten lazy.

478
00:30:22,021 --> 00:30:26,250
Sorry I'm, he's got a ballet
dancer and they punk group. Yeah.

479
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:28,180
And for a punk group or you
know, actually, you know,

480
00:30:28,181 --> 00:30:30,930
we've got a buddy who plays bass,
why don't we bring him over to sheriffs?

481
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:31,510
They brought suit.

482
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:36,110
So the three of us are there as the punk
group as a part of this multi, you know,

483
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:39,550
mix and match kind of
show and the jazz singer,

484
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:43,420
the obligatory American jazz singer,
jazz singer chick.

485
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:45,370
And she had the shoulder down.

486
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:53,680
She's out of tune and liked it that way.
The jazz attitude.

487
00:30:53,681 --> 00:30:56,530
And she's a punk van. And one day, so,

488
00:30:57,150 --> 00:31:02,080
but long story short, we, the first show,
we were not unprepared. We, you know,

489
00:31:02,081 --> 00:31:05,530
the, the a all kinds of
bedlam and craziness. And we
got the first shower door.

490
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:08,710
We don't even know how we're going to
finish the set that at one point she

491
00:31:08,711 --> 00:31:10,210
slinks off,
but she does her

492
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:15,500
mother slinks off like that.
And there's the Mike stand.

493
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:19,480
Then there we are and we're not
quite sure what, what to do next

494
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:25,630
based buyer walks up to the microphone
and the sound out of his mouth.

495
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:31,020
A keening wailing sound that
was soaring high with the stars,

496
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:38,970
with a pain and a yearning and not growing
feeling of the cosmos coming down to

497
00:31:41,291 --> 00:31:46,291
take us away and the heart of
this wave and the Andy and I.

498
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:48,843
Fuck me.

499
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:03,850
And so the police was
born, well, two things.

500
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:07,950
I didn't know he could write songs and I
didn't know he could sing like that and

501
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:12,080
that it was sort of Andy
who made it all the,

502
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:16,150
the whole thing come together. The
cocktail come together with the police.

503
00:32:16,151 --> 00:32:20,830
How did you decide on certain visual
aspects of the band or other stylistic

504
00:32:20,831 --> 00:32:23,980
decisions like the bleach
blonde hair for instance? Well,

505
00:32:23,981 --> 00:32:27,710
we would never be caught dead
discussing such matters. Uh,

506
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:30,700
the bleach blonde hair came from,
uh,

507
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,480
the fact that sting's wife was an actress.
She had an agent,

508
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:38,470
she took one look at her
client's husband and said,

509
00:32:38,471 --> 00:32:39,920
that guy belongs in front of a camera.

510
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:45,230
And she would send him for a modeling
jobs and in advertising and so on.

511
00:32:45,231 --> 00:32:47,910
And he would get every gig.
Um,

512
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:53,200
and one day they wanted a punk band
for a Wrigley's chewing gum commercial.

513
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:59,900
And so, uh, they called, you
know, he got the Gig and said,
well, I have a punk band.

514
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:04,120
I am myself a punk.
Um,

515
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:07,640
so they got Andy and I out there as well,

516
00:33:07,641 --> 00:33:11,960
but they didn't think we looked snarly
enough. I know. Let's peroxide their hair.

517
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,380
And uh, so the, the, the, the
wardrobe people just like the ladies,

518
00:33:15,381 --> 00:33:19,570
he got back there, they made us look the
part and we looked at each other, say,

519
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,140
that's kind of cool.

520
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:26,690
And so we got our blonde look from
a Wrigley's chewing gum commercial

521
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:32,960
somewhere they ad didn't run,
I guess it didn't test well or something.

522
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,640
And,
uh,

523
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:38,700
somewhere in a vault
somewhere is that ad of a,

524
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:43,610
the three blood heads blonde for the
first time. I actually am blonde.

525
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,970
Okay. This is real. It
actually I'll get gray,

526
00:33:46,971 --> 00:33:50,210
but I'm blonde too.
But alas,

527
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:53,870
the locust sick,

528
00:33:53,871 --> 00:33:58,430
my hair a common cause
of male pattern baldness,

529
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:03,050
you know, Stinko and I, music fulfills
a different purpose in our lives.

530
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,590
Uh, for me it's celebration, it's a party.

531
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:11,840
And for sting perhaps it's more
of a, um, an escape, you know,

532
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:15,590
a peaceful, beautiful place that
he can go to. And those two things,

533
00:34:15,591 --> 00:34:17,930
when we were codependent,
we,

534
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:22,550
the differences between
us really filled gaps.

535
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:26,300
And so it was very synergistic.
Um, but as we, you know,

536
00:34:26,301 --> 00:34:29,960
the first two albums were recorded
with that, the first album,

537
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:34,520
it was just us in the studio and we got
in there and we recorded an album in 20

538
00:34:34,521 --> 00:34:35,354
minutes.

539
00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:38,810
And then the second album was after we'd
started to get somewhere in America and

540
00:34:38,811 --> 00:34:42,110
we've been playing and we're getting
great reviews and burning down the house

541
00:34:42,111 --> 00:34:46,100
night after night and we're feeling
really great and they say you have your

542
00:34:46,101 --> 00:34:50,310
whole life to write your first album and
six months to write your second draft.

543
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:54,830
And so there were back in
the studio and you know,

544
00:34:54,831 --> 00:34:57,740
we've got half an album worth of
material but we got to get a new album.

545
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:01,640
And so that's second album. We just came
up with it. We were full of ourselves.

546
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:04,940
We're, you know, we were
validated by, you know, we,

547
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:08,840
we know that we're the coolest. So we
had the confidence in our second album,

548
00:35:08,841 --> 00:35:13,370
just was all creativity.
Had a bunch of hits on that record too.

549
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,020
So the third album,

550
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:20,470
we're going into the studio and
now we are not just us anymore.

551
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:24,500
This was the beginning of the police
becoming something that isn't our,

552
00:35:24,501 --> 00:35:28,280
just our little thing anymore. It's bigger
than us. And there's a momentum there.

553
00:35:28,281 --> 00:35:32,000
There's a record company that is counting
on hits and we were there in Holland.

554
00:35:32,001 --> 00:35:33,800
In fact,
recording the third albums and yacht.

555
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:38,610
I'm on data and the record
company are actually in the
studio. Is that a hint? No,

556
00:35:38,611 --> 00:35:42,180
I think the other one's hit and it was
like commerce was in the room with us and

557
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:45,870
it really bummed us out kind of like that.

558
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:50,010
But we were still had had a buzz
going and it was us against the world.

559
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:55,500
The next two albums which we recorded
in monster at and the Caribbean far,

560
00:35:56,041 --> 00:36:00,330
far away, 12 hours from the
nearest record company executive.

561
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:05,250
And there was just the
three of us and by now, um,

562
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:09,360
we were not so codependent.
But when it comes to music,

563
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:12,990
I kind of like working with an orchestra.
And by the way,

564
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,960
I write music for 60 piece orchestra.
They don't talk back.

565
00:36:15,961 --> 00:36:20,400
I put every note and how they play it
on the thing that Piccolo players been

566
00:36:20,401 --> 00:36:21,810
playing Piccolo his whole career.

567
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:26,130
But he's going to play exactly what I put
on the page. And it's not Deta Dah Dah.

568
00:36:26,131 --> 00:36:31,131
It's data data with a little diminuendo
at the end with articulate the Staccato,

569
00:36:31,711 --> 00:36:35,860
the third note, and then the, the,
the, you know, the slur over in,

570
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:40,200
I put on the page in ink in Italian,
exactly in 60 guys.

571
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:44,710
And that's how it works. And guess
what? Steam likes to do that too. Uh,

572
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:48,360
and he's real good at it and he has kind
of a track record of being successful

573
00:36:48,361 --> 00:36:49,600
at it.
Um,

574
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:54,030
but what he wants to do is kind of
different from what I want to do.

575
00:36:54,031 --> 00:36:56,760
The purpose of music for him has
a different purpose for me. And,

576
00:36:57,150 --> 00:37:02,150
and we came together for the reunion tour
and it was so hard for us to make the

577
00:37:03,811 --> 00:37:07,320
pieces fit back together. Cause
guess what, 20 years ago by,

578
00:37:07,321 --> 00:37:10,380
and we'd grown and I had lost,

579
00:37:10,381 --> 00:37:12,960
I'd gotten out of the habit of the
bass player turnaround and telling me

580
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:15,750
anything, you know, uh,

581
00:37:15,751 --> 00:37:19,380
and he'd gotten out of the habit of this
world war three going behind his left

582
00:37:19,381 --> 00:37:22,890
shoulder and he comes over
to, uh, well, maybe not,

583
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:28,630
you know. Oh, okay. Maybe not.

584
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:31,740
And, uh, you know, with the
best of intentions, you know,

585
00:37:31,741 --> 00:37:35,550
I'm sure sting looks at the
mirror every morning, says, okay,

586
00:37:35,551 --> 00:37:38,220
today I'm going to let Stewart be Stewart

587
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:43,230
and I would look in the mirror in
the morning. Anything he wants,

588
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:47,250
I will be there for him.
Any scintilla of, of a new,

589
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:51,270
I will listen and I will do my best to
remember what he told me. And you know,

590
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:54,210
and that gets us through
the first hour of rehearsal.

591
00:37:57,060 --> 00:38:01,110
This is the thing about Francis Coppola
as he can spot talent and his, you know,

592
00:38:01,111 --> 00:38:03,930
very different from somebody like Oliver
Stone for whom I've scored as well,

593
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:07,530
who stone himself owns every frame,

594
00:38:07,531 --> 00:38:11,010
every aspect of the film comes from his
creativity. And that's what he does,

595
00:38:11,011 --> 00:38:14,010
you know, uh, he doesn't
want people to clever ideas.

596
00:38:14,011 --> 00:38:16,650
He wants people who are clever, it
carrying out his ideas. Unfortunately,

597
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,560
he's got really great idea.

598
00:38:18,561 --> 00:38:22,140
So Frances has a different technique.

599
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:26,670
He finds people that have the talent and
he just gives them a long lead. It says,

600
00:38:26,671 --> 00:38:31,290
you just go for it. You take it, take it.
And I want to see what you come up with.

601
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:34,680
And that was a good relationship.
What did,

602
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:39,540
what was different about the idea that
you presented? Uh, for the material?

603
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:44,470
I'll give you a clue, which was
the, his people is produced,

604
00:38:44,471 --> 00:38:48,970
kept saying, when's the scoring date
date? I've been in the studio for a month.

605
00:38:48,971 --> 00:38:53,410
We mean date, you know, the way they used
to do films was there to have a date.

606
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:57,970
And on the date they show up with the
orchestra and they record the music on

607
00:38:57,971 --> 00:39:01,420
that day. And uh, that's the,
that's the recording session.

608
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,970
I don't do it like that.
I,

609
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:07,090
I'm in the studio by myself and
I play a little bit of drums,

610
00:39:07,091 --> 00:39:10,810
then I add some guitar and then I settle
around over here and I'm working on

611
00:39:10,811 --> 00:39:12,400
building it. Like, you make a record.

612
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:17,200
And I was gonna say that was just
completely an alien exercise. I mean,

613
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:19,780
the people would come down and they
said, this is kind of interesting. And,

614
00:39:19,781 --> 00:39:22,000
but there was the moment
when Francis did turn around,

615
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:26,080
so this all sounds really fantastic.
And all of his old guys,

616
00:39:26,081 --> 00:39:28,750
his crew that he'd been working with
forever, they're all thinking, wow,

617
00:39:28,751 --> 00:39:31,990
this is really different on or anything
like that. But it kind of works.

618
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:36,010
I said crazy, but it kind
of works, you know? And um,

619
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:40,240
but it did turn around and say, I want the
strings. You know, I need some strings.

620
00:39:40,241 --> 00:39:43,890
And I'm going, Oh shit, he's going to
hire some string schlocky guy, Francis,

621
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,370
you're so right.
You need strings.

622
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:50,380
I going to fix up some nice strings and
strings, you know, nice strings, strings.

623
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:53,590
And so I call up the contractor and said,
send me some strings. And he says, well,

624
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:57,490
okay, sure, fine. How
many strings? I Dunno,

625
00:39:57,491 --> 00:39:59,500
how many strings is strings

626
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:05,860
send me some strengths,
you know? And so these,

627
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:10,620
I think it was maybe 1415 guys
showed up, you know, strings and a,

628
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,130
they arrive and usually
a recording session,

629
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:15,160
your guitar shows up and you
book them for the afternoon.

630
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,580
Then he comes in with his 10 guitars and
couple of apps with a bunch of pedals.

631
00:40:18,581 --> 00:40:20,590
And he said, okay. So the first thing,

632
00:40:20,591 --> 00:40:22,730
it's just kind of like
gay dad ain't doing India.

633
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:23,740
And then when it comes to that show,

634
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:28,360
get a shop of his name and you know
Matt Dillon and he's called it the,

635
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:31,190
you know that kid with a Bandanna.
Okay. On the shot of just kinda hit it,

636
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:34,480
you kind of thing there and then kind
of pull back a little bit in there and

637
00:40:34,481 --> 00:40:35,980
then you, you know, and you're
talking to him like that.

638
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:38,860
And that's the way you work at. And the
guy who, oh cool, how about this? Maybe,

639
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:40,640
how about that? Try
that. Stratacap you know,

640
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:45,580
you talk and it's an interaction in
between the two of you collaborate and you

641
00:40:45,581 --> 00:40:50,560
get it.
So the strings arrive a lot of them.

642
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:54,910
And so I go out to do my thing. Hey
guys, it's great to have you here.

643
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:57,280
It has movies, kind of an art
movie and you know, the first song,

644
00:40:57,281 --> 00:40:58,180
it's kind of thinking that the guy that,

645
00:40:58,181 --> 00:40:59,560
and then when you see
the guy with the Bandana,

646
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:01,150
it just kind of goes a
little long like that.

647
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:02,590
And I'm talking and
I'm talking about them.

648
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,720
And they're looking kind of
more and more uncomfortable.

649
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:11,200
And eventually one of them says, ah,
my stroke. Um, the one of the play,

650
00:41:11,201 --> 00:41:14,920
what the music on the page here or
whatever the fuck you're talking about.

651
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,090
And I play the page by page.

652
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:24,220
And so they do invite the page. By
the way, in this case was footballs,

653
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,710
what they call this whole notes.
Nice.

654
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,770
Eh,
you know,

655
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:33,520
I didn't know how to write it.

656
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:39,560
I didn't know how to write
that music at that time.

657
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:43,970
So it was just the chords that
I was playing myself. Bling,

658
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:49,370
bling here, stop the tape. Okay.

659
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:54,260
Roll tape bleeding
and uh,

660
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:57,530
ear bought and put that on a chart
so that that's the top. No, no. Okay.

661
00:41:57,531 --> 00:42:02,531
We'll give that the violin and violin
to viola and I had an arranger put it on

662
00:42:02,991 --> 00:42:05,260
the page, you know, then
I need to study, you know,

663
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:07,610
I was a music major in
college so I could read it,

664
00:42:07,611 --> 00:42:11,540
but I hadn't seen a sheet of music
in 20 years in rock and roll.

665
00:42:11,541 --> 00:42:15,500
There are no sheets of music and it just,
it's just not part of the vocabulary.

666
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:17,540
But here with these
string players a section.

667
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:21,060
And so they have these footballs and
they say, well look, it's all footballs.

668
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:24,310
Can we just, uh, this is run it down and
everybody wants, you want to peek from

669
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:29,010
the thesis.
They go,

670
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:33,980
let's just down in a day,
day, day day did, okay,

671
00:42:33,981 --> 00:42:38,030
cool. Okay. Roll tape. And they play
and they were done in like half an hour.

672
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:41,050
They just played what was on the page,
you know,

673
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,530
I didn't need to talk to them at all.

674
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:45,140
They just play was on the page and they
played it and there were, you know,

675
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:50,120
after the guitarist guy, he's
there all afternoon, you're
trying stuff. These guys,

676
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:54,890
it's on the page,
they play it exactly in their done.

677
00:42:55,670 --> 00:43:00,500
Wow.
Wow.

678
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:04,520
You meet. All I gotta do is
figure it out and do the homework,

679
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:08,170
put it on the stand and they plan.
So 20 years later I, you know,

680
00:43:08,270 --> 00:43:12,450
I'd done maybe 40, 50
films, TV commercials, uh,

681
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:16,430
and all this stuff and you use
orchestra lot. And pretty soon I got,

682
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:21,590
I learned how to write down a little bit
of a battle and a fancy stuff. And, um,

683
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:25,280
the best part of it is that it's about
the home with a band you think on your

684
00:43:25,281 --> 00:43:26,960
feet and it's an interaction.

685
00:43:26,961 --> 00:43:30,140
Musicians of the ear musicians are
divided at birth into two categories.

686
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:32,500
Musicians of the ear and
musicians of the eye.

687
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:34,820
Musicians of the ear where I come from,

688
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,800
they're connected to the music by the ear.

689
00:43:36,801 --> 00:43:41,060
They're staring off in space and they
just know when eight bars are up and they

690
00:43:41,061 --> 00:43:42,740
know where to listen for the groove.

691
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:46,220
And they're part of that groove and
they're connected with their ear musicians

692
00:43:46,221 --> 00:43:49,620
of the,
I read a chart and they,

693
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:53,300
their fingers follow what
their eyes told them to play.

694
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:57,330
And even the rhythm comes
from the conductor, a visual
cue, the conductor's baton.

695
00:43:57,331 --> 00:44:02,331
It their eyes connect them to the
music and the musicians of the ear,

696
00:44:02,481 --> 00:44:06,320
they just make that shit up. Uh,
it's, it's a collaborative way.

697
00:44:06,321 --> 00:44:09,110
It's improvisational.
They know that it's ea and d,

698
00:44:09,111 --> 00:44:10,110
but how are you going to hit that?

699
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:13,670
[inaudible] how are you going to which
inversion of a, you know, and so there's,

700
00:44:13,671 --> 00:44:16,940
you know, it's the, it's a
collaboration. You work it out together,

701
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,810
it takes forever. Uh,
but an orchestral music,

702
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:24,650
you put it on the page and they will
play it. And like I said before,

703
00:44:24,651 --> 00:44:27,580
it's not just Dah, Dah,
Dah, as dotted down,

704
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:32,460
you know that you put that shit and you
have to put all that shape on the page.

705
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:34,380
And if you do 60 guys,

706
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:38,850
then that guy over there on the double
bass and that guy way over there on

707
00:44:38,851 --> 00:44:42,150
second violin and they're 30,
40 feet away from each other.

708
00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:45,450
But each of them has their own
book with only their own part.

709
00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:51,000
And if they follow exactly what's on
the page and execute it beautifully,

710
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:52,560
then they all,

711
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:56,790
all 60 of them become the
mighty Chicago symphony.

712
00:44:57,390 --> 00:44:59,760
And that's where their ego lies.
Not from,

713
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:02,360
I'm gonna Express myself on
this part here. Goddamn it.

714
00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:06,780
Even though I'm the third
chair, second violin, no,

715
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:07,830
their ego,

716
00:45:07,831 --> 00:45:12,090
their pride in their work comes from these
corporate identity of the magnificent

717
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:14,610
orchestra of which they are part.
And by the way,

718
00:45:14,611 --> 00:45:18,690
they're playing Mendelssohn
and Brahms and really,

719
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:21,900
really good music.
The best of the best of the best.

720
00:45:21,901 --> 00:45:23,880
That has withstood the test of time.

721
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:28,920
So there's two completely
different musical universes and a,

722
00:45:28,921 --> 00:45:32,460
I love jamming with guys who come over
to my studio and we jam and we just make

723
00:45:32,461 --> 00:45:33,390
it up as we go along.

724
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:38,930
But I also love to do that homework and
get it on the page and conceive of every

725
00:45:39,031 --> 00:45:42,480
aspect of it where the swell is,
where the surge,

726
00:45:42,481 --> 00:45:46,070
the ebb and the flow in that violin lended
going up to there and he gets up high

727
00:45:46,071 --> 00:45:49,500
like that and the Trump, it takes it over
and then go buy boom on the low brass.

728
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:53,940
Oh, I, you know, that's just really a
lot of fun to conceive of that stuff.

729
00:45:53,941 --> 00:45:58,941
And then you go and you sit with the
orchestra and they play it and without

730
00:45:59,041 --> 00:46:01,680
debate and the first time, what's
that? It's a little creaky.

731
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:03,840
The second time it's like wow.

732
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:07,410
And then by showtime it's really
good fun to play that stuff.

733
00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:12,390
I like this question. This is
from James Stubbs, Facebook.

734
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:16,530
He's one of the few rock drummers
that plays traditional grip.

735
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:17,790
How did he come to play that way?

736
00:46:17,790 --> 00:46:21,030
So maybe you could also explain
to people what this means. Well,

737
00:46:21,031 --> 00:46:24,810
in Olden Times these snare
drum was a military instrument,

738
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:26,183
a former GE,

739
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:31,700
and to March with and the snare drums
or that deep cylinder like this and that

740
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:36,000
deep into march with it.
Like this is Kinda hard.

741
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:40,200
So what they do is they turn on its side
so that the drum is like that and you

742
00:46:40,201 --> 00:46:44,190
can still march, which means to hit the
drum. Like this is kind of a problem.

743
00:46:44,370 --> 00:46:49,370
So how about this hand hold the stick
like that and you create the drum?

744
00:46:49,891 --> 00:46:53,270
Is that this angle? And now your
sticks can go like that because that,

745
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:56,370
whereas this would be a problem.
That's where it came from. Okay.

746
00:46:56,371 --> 00:47:00,120
When they took the snare drum and put it
on a drum set and created the trap set

747
00:47:00,121 --> 00:47:02,640
probably down in New Orleans or somewhere,
wherever they,

748
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:07,350
whoever had the idea of
assembling a bunch of drums. Uh,

749
00:47:07,770 --> 00:47:12,100
and to the traps set, uh,
the snare drum was, you know,

750
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:16,650
the technique of playing it
still was this, you know,
both hands are not the same.

751
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:19,380
This is called match grip.
This is called Orthodox.

752
00:47:19,381 --> 00:47:24,381
It's old school and just the practitioners
would set up this newly invented

753
00:47:24,661 --> 00:47:28,920
contraption and have the snare
drum at that angle. Okay, years go.

754
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:32,920
And I learned from that, from, you know,
buddy rich and the gene Krupa style,

755
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:36,340
the my father, as soon as he spotted
me as a musician had me in lessons,

756
00:47:36,341 --> 00:47:37,300
which meant Orthodox,

757
00:47:37,301 --> 00:47:42,301
I book paradiddles and slamming it and
all the rudiments and everything with

758
00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:43,121
this technique.

759
00:47:43,121 --> 00:47:47,020
And then nowadays a drummer can set up
the drums at any how he darn well wants.

760
00:47:47,021 --> 00:47:51,820
And these has it logically flat and
the Tom Tom Logically like that.

761
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:56,050
And what's this for?
So he plays like this nowadays.

762
00:47:56,080 --> 00:48:00,070
Nowadays drummers all play match
decrypt. It makes perfect sense. Now,

763
00:48:00,071 --> 00:48:04,090
in my opinion,
this is a bigger digit than this.

764
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,390
There's bigger muscles here,
so,

765
00:48:06,410 --> 00:48:11,020
and I want to get that
backbeat look out baby.

766
00:48:11,021 --> 00:48:16,021
This hammer's coming down with this
thumb to bring it down and it's a,

767
00:48:16,281 --> 00:48:18,520
seems like a more stronger thing.
I Dunno.

768
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:21,880
It's not matched and say
you learned to make it set.

769
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:25,630
The effect is the same but
different mechanics in each hand.

770
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:27,213
Glad you asked.

771
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:32,720
[inaudible]

772
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:37,640
and the next one is from Masud Khan.
We don't have to do 10,

773
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:40,970
but he asked the 10 top 10 albums
you would take to another planet.

774
00:48:41,270 --> 00:48:45,720
Let's just say three
albums. The old desert. Uh,

775
00:48:46,610 --> 00:48:50,000
well any Hendrix album, but probably the
double one because it's a double one.

776
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:55,880
A, which would be the third one.
Uh, access. No, not access. Um,

777
00:48:55,970 --> 00:48:58,700
what was the third one?
Voodoo child or visited double album.

778
00:48:58,910 --> 00:49:03,320
All the naked girls on bicycles. Uh,
I'll go, I'll go Google it later.

779
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:09,140
Anyhow, that's one. Uh,
I'm not a huge Beatles fan,

780
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:13,190
but I would probably take either the
white album or sergeant pepper just cause

781
00:49:13,191 --> 00:49:16,220
the variety. If we're going to be
stuck on that island for a long time,

782
00:49:16,221 --> 00:49:19,040
we need some variety.
Um,

783
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:21,410
and uh,

784
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:25,850
probably some blues just
cause it makes me feel good.

785
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:30,440
But then again I could play blues myself.
No, I wouldn't take a blues record. Uh,

786
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:32,480
I dunno. Some classical, some Stravinsky,

787
00:49:32,481 --> 00:49:34,970
probably write some
spring or Patrice scheme.

788
00:49:35,870 --> 00:49:38,240
And if you're out of the running,

789
00:49:38,241 --> 00:49:43,241
if you had to combine since say three
drummers alive or dead into your sort of

790
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:46,850
perfect super drummer,
who would they be and why?

791
00:49:46,910 --> 00:49:50,450
I would take the majesty of John Bottom.

792
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:55,790
He achieved with very few drum strokes,
very sides,

793
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,850
but boom,
boom.

794
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:04,700
It just sounds like a mountain. And
everybody, nobody has gotten there,

795
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:09,200
figured out how to make a drum set.
Sounds so huge.

796
00:50:09,201 --> 00:50:11,960
And it's the economy and it's
the way he hits the drum.

797
00:50:11,961 --> 00:50:15,710
Just some magic about the way he played,
created size,

798
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:20,840
just hugeness.
Then I would take uh,

799
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:25,690
God, I'm terrible with names.
Uh, James Brown's drummer,

800
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:30,160
stubble fields, double
anyone here. Anyone cried?

801
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:33,980
Stubblefield for funk cause
we've got a dance, you know,

802
00:50:33,981 --> 00:50:37,490
and he's not a star guy,
but just give me some of that.

803
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:41,420
And so we're all be dancing and
those few Dender will be, you know,

804
00:50:41,421 --> 00:50:43,920
doing what they do.
Uh,

805
00:50:43,970 --> 00:50:47,570
and then I would take Mitch Mitchell
for technique or buddy rich.

806
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:51,410
What about the technique?
Just the effervescence,

807
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:56,020
the lively spark of either,
it'd be tough between, uh,

808
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:58,760
I mean buddy rich is the number.

809
00:50:58,761 --> 00:51:01,850
He is the absolute top God
whether you like his music or not,

810
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,470
there's nobody who's been able to
achieve just the manual dexterity,

811
00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:09,410
let alone the artistry and
everything else. I mean,

812
00:51:09,411 --> 00:51:12,920
he really isn't a class of his own.
Mitch Mitchell is up there as well,

813
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:18,100
but he had, he was, his music was more fun
and more effervescent and, and science.

814
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:22,540
I'd probably take John Bonham,
Clyde Stubblefield and,

815
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,890
and Mitch Mitchell since we saw you
tearing it up in the first video that we

816
00:51:27,891 --> 00:51:31,250
showed. This next question is
from I am Keith Andrew on Twitter.

817
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:35,870
What weaknesses in your playing or
writing or composing bug you and are you

818
00:51:35,871 --> 00:51:40,060
fighting to overcome? How do
you fight them? Uh, arthritis.

819
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:46,400
Uh, and right now I play with
an orchestra and my drums, uh,

820
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:50,240
are designed to play to
accompany amplified instruments,

821
00:51:50,241 --> 00:51:52,730
which can be any amount of volume,
you know,

822
00:51:52,731 --> 00:51:57,731
so Dominic and range of the rock and roll
drummer goes from seven to 12 guitar.

823
00:51:57,771 --> 00:52:02,540
It's only go to 11 and
drummers. And by the way,

824
00:52:02,541 --> 00:52:07,490
we don't do it by turning a little
mob. We do it by hitting it. And, uh,

825
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:11,660
in the orchestra,
the orchestra feels very loud,

826
00:52:11,661 --> 00:52:14,480
but it's in fact a quarter
of the volume of a rock band.

827
00:52:14,830 --> 00:52:16,800
And when you go to a concert
and you see an orchestra play,

828
00:52:16,801 --> 00:52:21,410
it feels emotionally really big.
But physics wise,

829
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,630
it's actually much more quiet.

830
00:52:24,110 --> 00:52:28,280
And so you have the huge rockstar and
you put the drug in their crack and the

831
00:52:28,281 --> 00:52:30,290
orchestra is God, they're
toast. You can't hear him,

832
00:52:30,291 --> 00:52:33,050
nothing because the drums are so low.

833
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:35,690
So the biggest challenge
has been to play quietly.

834
00:52:35,691 --> 00:52:39,320
And I now after years of playing with
orchestras and working on it, and,

835
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:43,910
and I practiced with the
music, barely audible. So I, I,

836
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:48,530
I can't accompanied unless I get it
down there. And a couple of things.

837
00:52:48,531 --> 00:52:52,880
First of all, less work. Second of
all, the drum sound so much better.

838
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:53,960
Third of all,

839
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:58,250
all kinds of finesse of technique that I
learned as a kid but never could use in

840
00:52:58,251 --> 00:53:02,330
rock and roll. They just have,
we never hear the, you know,

841
00:53:02,331 --> 00:53:05,660
a rough or a drag, you know, you can't
hear them in rock roll. Now you can.

842
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:09,230
So they sound great, cool
technique, less work.

843
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:11,900
And so learning how to play that quietly,

844
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:14,810
I can now play a fawn drum set,

845
00:53:14,870 --> 00:53:19,590
my drum set designed for the
aforementioned cacophony. Uh,

846
00:53:19,850 --> 00:53:22,220
and there's a violin solo that I wrote,

847
00:53:22,221 --> 00:53:27,210
a nice little violin solo and
she's 30 feet away and I'm not the,

848
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:32,220
and I can now play so quietly, but I
can hear her and soak in the audience,

849
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:37,090
you know, and uh, that,
that's an achievement is the,
as we mentioned, arthritis,

850
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:40,770
is that, is that a real issue there
you're contending with? Absolutely. Yeah.

851
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:44,970
They're there. They're there on the
y. How do my thoughts, how do you,

852
00:53:45,390 --> 00:53:48,600
how do you deal with that? Well,
I find that if I, you know,

853
00:53:48,601 --> 00:53:51,480
I don't look at my drums until I've
got a show coming up in this year.

854
00:53:51,481 --> 00:53:53,280
I've had shows coming up all year,

855
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:57,900
so I've been in shape and so I have to
start up. It's like rocky, you know,

856
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:01,380
I start slow and I work it up and I
have little things like that to get,

857
00:54:01,390 --> 00:54:02,220
you know,

858
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:06,630
and I find that when I get fit
to play and I'm up to speed,

859
00:54:06,631 --> 00:54:11,631
the arthritis goes away and it doesn't
return until I walk away from the drums.

860
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:15,930
And I don't even look at them
until next time I have to.

861
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:19,120
And then the arthritis creeps back in,
opening a door out.

862
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:23,960
If it's locked a locked
door. Ah, man, that's hurts,

863
00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:28,350
you know? And, uh, and I think Darren,

864
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:31,530
this is really inconvenient for what I do,
but in fact,

865
00:54:31,531 --> 00:54:33,990
when I started playing drums, when I
get fit, you know, it's not a problem.

866
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:37,790
Did you do anything else for self
care in the hands or the yeah,

867
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:40,380
there's the stretches.
I have a thing that I got in China,

868
00:54:40,381 --> 00:54:41,430
which is like our little

869
00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:47,610
pointy soft wooden thing that I
just sort of massage the muscles.

870
00:54:47,611 --> 00:54:51,090
And like I say that there's
quite a fash fetish.

871
00:54:51,091 --> 00:54:55,410
I'm pretty familiar with the structure
of the hand and there's 10 bones there

872
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:57,750
and like all this really complicated,

873
00:54:57,751 --> 00:55:02,751
but I'm pretty into making it
work and playing at that volume.

874
00:55:03,270 --> 00:55:07,890
It's just isn't the stress that it is at
high volume. So this might be related,

875
00:55:08,010 --> 00:55:11,540
but a next question is from
tinker coffee co at tinker Topica.

876
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,080
What's the most technical
but underappreciated skill
for our drummer to possess

877
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:19,470
a, I would say that quiet thing quiet. Um,

878
00:55:19,890 --> 00:55:24,480
because I have drummers who have that
range dynamic range of seven to 12.

879
00:55:25,290 --> 00:55:30,000
Uh, and that's just really hard work. You
know, my, my buddy, uh, fishermen in fish,

880
00:55:30,510 --> 00:55:33,360
he's really quiet.
He's been doing that.

881
00:55:33,361 --> 00:55:35,730
Oh and I saw a bad guy and you know,

882
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:40,750
you see them from the front and it's
blazing cause there's a 50 zillion watt PA

883
00:55:40,771 --> 00:55:42,690
system to make it louder.

884
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:46,650
He doesn't need to make it ladder and
saw the sign this and watching and he's

885
00:55:46,651 --> 00:55:50,970
just comfy. He's hardly breaking
a sweat. I'm going to do that,

886
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:53,130
you know,
and playing quietly.

887
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:57,630
That's the most unappreciated technique
that I would say to answer that question.

888
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:02,200
All right, well given that you're,
you're, so you're talking, uh,

889
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:06,480
sort of categories are the, do not
discuss lists for dinner conversation.

890
00:56:06,481 --> 00:56:07,920
If you were to give a Ted talk,
let's say,

891
00:56:07,921 --> 00:56:12,570
or some high profile talk 20 minutes long,
but you couldn't talk about music,

892
00:56:12,571 --> 00:56:15,090
couldn't talk about drumming,
nothing that you're known for,

893
00:56:15,150 --> 00:56:20,150
but maybe some secret obsession or thing
that you study on the weekends or in

894
00:56:20,431 --> 00:56:23,590
the evenings or anything for that matter.
What you talk about,

895
00:56:23,830 --> 00:56:26,770
Old Testament Theology,
Old Testament theology.

896
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:31,680
Yeah. All right, well tell us more.

897
00:56:31,830 --> 00:56:33,240
I grew up in the holy land

898
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:37,880
and they're still arguing
about it now to this day. Uh,

899
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,800
who's is it and a which religion prevails.

900
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:45,840
And it turns out that the three religions
fighting most vociferously over that

901
00:56:45,841 --> 00:56:50,190
piece of real estate are
the same religion. Uh,

902
00:56:50,191 --> 00:56:51,360
they come from the same book.

903
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:55,950
And the Old Testament is that book in the
Old Testament is unique because I also

904
00:56:55,951 --> 00:56:59,430
love Egyptian history. You know, I
think Moses was a jackass. You know,

905
00:56:59,431 --> 00:57:02,400
th th th the Egyptian
history was a beautiful,

906
00:57:02,430 --> 00:57:06,210
beautiful thing as described
in the old testament. You know,

907
00:57:06,211 --> 00:57:10,380
the Egyptians were great people with
great values of beautiful culture,

908
00:57:10,650 --> 00:57:13,170
but the people who wrote the
Old Testament didn't think so.

909
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:17,820
So the Egyptians describe their
enemies in these pejorative terms and,

910
00:57:17,821 --> 00:57:22,821
and turn are described by the
Israelites in these pejorative terms.

911
00:57:23,641 --> 00:57:28,410
It's fascinating because in the
Egyptian history, there was no plagues.

912
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:31,860
There was no Moses,
there was no exodus.

913
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:36,960
And so obviously the exodus and the
events referred to in the Old Testament,

914
00:57:37,290 --> 00:57:40,250
there's something happened
historically to PR to,

915
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:43,530
to create what became these stories.
You know,

916
00:57:43,531 --> 00:57:46,770
there's gotta be an origin to these
stories. Which feral was that?

917
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:51,110
Which part of Egyptian history was
that? Um, you know, traditionally it's,

918
00:57:51,111 --> 00:57:54,180
it's Ramsey too, you know, the big
one just because he's the biggest,

919
00:57:54,210 --> 00:57:57,270
but it wasn't man, you figured out
there are these different chronologies.

920
00:57:57,271 --> 00:58:00,750
There's the archeology. Uh, or
let's start with the Old Testament,

921
00:58:00,751 --> 00:58:04,500
which says that a thousand
years ago, Moses did this, uh,

922
00:58:04,590 --> 00:58:08,370
so many thousand year ago, Solomon
Solomon did that and there's a chronology.

923
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:10,890
Then there's the Egyptian chronology,

924
00:58:11,010 --> 00:58:15,900
which has its list of kings and
it's not measured in 1927 nights.

925
00:58:16,070 --> 00:58:20,010
It's like this king in the third
year of King Center. Kreb the second,

926
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:22,890
and it's like you have to know how many,
there's that chronology.

927
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:27,300
Then there's the archeology.
The strata of Jericho,

928
00:58:27,301 --> 00:58:31,980
for instance, tells us that there
was no burning down of Jericho.

929
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:35,370
When the Bible says that they
came, the came, you know,

930
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:39,720
they came and burned down Jericho. None
happened folks. Jericho has been burned,

931
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:44,130
but not when the Bible says it did a
couple of 3000 years early. Well, okay,

932
00:58:44,131 --> 00:58:46,670
well let's pull that.
Bob will call you down.

933
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:49,260
Pull this one up so that that matches now.

934
00:58:49,410 --> 00:58:53,090
Well then we've got a problem with the
Egyptian chronology, so we stretch that.

935
00:58:53,091 --> 00:58:55,470
Then Shit, you know, and
the period of Solomon,

936
00:58:55,950 --> 00:59:00,950
there are no great architectural
masterpieces or anything to denote a great

937
00:59:01,021 --> 00:59:04,470
kingdom during the time of Solomon.
It doesn't mean he didn't exist.

938
00:59:04,650 --> 00:59:09,390
It means that the chronology of when the
Bible said he exists might be a little

939
00:59:09,391 --> 00:59:11,100
inaccurate.
So you like,

940
00:59:11,310 --> 00:59:14,880
that's what I can find
endlessly fascinating.

941
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:26,280
Wow. Okay. Okay. I know,
I know, I know, I know

942
00:59:26,350 --> 00:59:28,690
I lost you.
I totally lost you there for a minute,

943
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:33,280
but I'm going to bring you back. Okay.
Over in the west side of Los Angeles,

944
00:59:33,281 --> 00:59:36,850
there's all these private schools where
all US fancy folks send our kids and

945
00:59:36,851 --> 00:59:37,511
there's only a few of us,

946
00:59:37,511 --> 00:59:41,500
all US fancy folks send our kids and
they have these school gala fundraising

947
00:59:41,501 --> 00:59:42,190
events.

948
00:59:42,190 --> 00:59:46,800
Where they raised money is if they need
to raise money and they have this gala

949
00:59:46,801 --> 00:59:49,960
event and they have, you know, all
the bands, you know, and uh, you know,

950
00:59:49,961 --> 00:59:53,980
we got to all the dads is going
to be some rock stars in there.

951
00:59:54,250 --> 00:59:57,280
And so they have, you know, I
call what I call the grateful dad,

952
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:02,620
which is the school band, um, of whatever
dads are in that school. And you know,

953
01:00:02,621 --> 01:00:05,020
one of the schools here at Wildwood,
the school,

954
01:00:05,050 --> 01:00:08,320
the grateful dad was Stephen Stills.
Gene Simmons,

955
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:13,010
me a Barclay,
um,

956
01:00:15,010 --> 01:00:16,420
Travis bark glee

957
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:23,090
miles in a wheelchair,
kind of a wrap.

958
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:26,590
[inaudible] and Bob, Bob Dylan was
supposed to be there but he bailed.

959
01:00:26,950 --> 01:00:31,660
So that's the bad gene Simmons
Steven stills in me. Okay.
That's pretty disparate.

960
01:00:31,661 --> 01:00:34,510
What we've figured out a show we
played for all the dads. Okay.

961
01:00:34,511 --> 01:00:39,511
Turns out that Gene Simmons is a
student of Old Testament theology.

962
01:00:41,470 --> 01:00:45,070
So they're at this event where
we're playing all this stuff.

963
01:00:45,071 --> 01:00:50,071
Like there's the Bass player of kiss
and the drummer of police backstage are

964
01:00:50,651 --> 01:00:53,800
agreeing about which profit knows that.
But Diet was not those

965
01:00:56,850 --> 01:01:01,850
[inaudible]

966
01:01:03,950 --> 01:01:07,430
very well read guy.
Are there any quotes?

967
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:12,440
Is there a quote or quotes that you either
live your life by or think of often?

968
01:01:14,450 --> 01:01:15,740
Don't worry.
Be Happy.

969
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:17,173
All right.

970
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:22,120
[inaudible] by the way,
by the way,

971
01:01:22,270 --> 01:01:24,610
that's is the first thing that came to
my mind and thank you for that. Nice,

972
01:01:24,611 --> 01:01:29,500
polite pleather. What the fuck
does that mean? What uses that?

973
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:33,730
Don't worry.
Be Happy as if is there a pill for that?

974
01:01:35,250 --> 01:01:39,400
So good advice. But it is
good advice. Kind of facile.

975
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:43,420
So we can also come back to
that one. If anything, if any,

976
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:48,280
if there's someone who is particularly
quotable in your mind in a way that has

977
01:01:48,281 --> 01:01:51,770
impacted you, maybe that's another
way to tackle it. Uh, you know,

978
01:01:51,790 --> 01:01:56,350
for me it would be a Seneca, maybe an
Emerson. Wow, that's sophisticated. Well,

979
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:59,560
I mean Seneca, no, I'll show you how
unsophisticated I am. So from Long Island,

980
01:01:59,561 --> 01:02:02,500
I thought Seneca was,
and there is another Seneca and fairness,

981
01:02:02,501 --> 01:02:04,930
but a native American elder for
the longest time I was like,

982
01:02:04,931 --> 01:02:06,790
this guy's the best quote ever.
That was like, oh wait, he's a,

983
01:02:06,791 --> 01:02:08,260
Roman has been dead for 2000 years.

984
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:12,010
But that was a football team or city.

985
01:02:12,011 --> 01:02:16,630
And he does a lot of things. Seneca
has been used for a lot of labeling.

986
01:02:18,310 --> 01:02:19,143
If you

987
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:23,760
saying giving advice to a young musician,

988
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:27,240
very capable musician who's
getting ready for their first,

989
01:02:27,241 --> 01:02:31,290
would they perceive to be big Gig?
And they're just all nerves.

990
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:34,330
They are. They feel like
they've got a bottom. Yeah.

991
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:39,220
By the way, a presenter of
a television show, it could
have been made. What advice,

992
01:02:39,250 --> 01:02:42,070
what advice would you give
that person? Relax, relax.

993
01:02:42,970 --> 01:02:47,170
Take that as your living room. It's
um, well that particular thing,

994
01:02:47,171 --> 01:02:49,630
there's a bunch of
specific to that challenge,

995
01:02:49,631 --> 01:02:53,360
which is that there are audiences on your
side. You're getting your, your, your,

996
01:02:53,630 --> 01:02:58,630
you walk out on stage as a total success
and it's yours to throw away and it's

997
01:02:59,351 --> 01:03:03,640
really hard to throw away,
you know? Um, so relax,

998
01:03:04,570 --> 01:03:09,310
assume that you're blowing everybody away.
Um,

999
01:03:10,810 --> 01:03:14,170
and everything else will take care of
itself. You know, when I was young,

1000
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:17,770
I used to think that I got to get myself
out to go on stage and I got to go out.

1001
01:03:19,930 --> 01:03:23,200
But in fact, that's a dissipation
of the energy, you know,

1002
01:03:23,201 --> 01:03:27,520
there was that film whiplash where the
kid is trying to get better and he goes

1003
01:03:27,521 --> 01:03:29,980
back to woodshed,
may show him the woodshed.

1004
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:34,150
That's the one thing they got
wrong. Yeah. Uh, to get better,

1005
01:03:34,151 --> 01:03:38,530
you don't grow like
that. You go like that,

1006
01:03:39,030 --> 01:03:42,490
you know, calmly. And the more
relaxed you can be, the more energy,

1007
01:03:42,491 --> 01:03:47,470
the more ferocity you can achieve
by being relaxed. You know,

1008
01:03:47,620 --> 01:03:51,190
definitely mass murder is
best delivered cold. Is that

1009
01:03:53,790 --> 01:03:58,510
well, I mean I revenge is best
served. Oh yeah. There we go.

1010
01:03:58,570 --> 01:03:59,020
The uh,

1011
01:03:59,020 --> 01:04:03,940
80 act of violence has more aggression
and violence if it's done commonly.

1012
01:04:04,330 --> 01:04:08,500
Well, you also see this in a athletics,
right? I mean, it's kind of a nervous,

1013
01:04:08,501 --> 01:04:13,270
evil laugh going around the room.
This little chorus of Dr Evil Laugh.

1014
01:04:13,271 --> 01:04:17,830
That's all right. Yeah. Uh, I mean,
you see the wives check your husbands,

1015
01:04:19,810 --> 01:04:21,890
you see the ability to teach

1016
01:04:21,950 --> 01:04:24,410
for an off informing the ability
to turn out, right. I mean,

1017
01:04:24,411 --> 01:04:26,580
you see this in athletics all the time,
meaning the,

1018
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:31,920
the someone's capacity to turn off and
relax being directly correlated to their

1019
01:04:32,481 --> 01:04:35,930
ability to turn it on if they're
always on or somewhere in the middle.

1020
01:04:35,931 --> 01:04:38,270
It just doesn't seem to
manifest the same way.

1021
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:42,530
I remember hearing this story
about a gent named Marcello Garcia,

1022
01:04:42,531 --> 01:04:45,260
so he's considered sort of the
Michael Jordan, Mike Tyson,

1023
01:04:45,650 --> 01:04:49,130
Wayne Gretzky combined to the Brazilian
Jujitsu world is something like a nine

1024
01:04:49,131 --> 01:04:52,250
time world champion. And I know, uh,

1025
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:54,530
a fellow who co owns a school that,

1026
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:57,290
and Marcel has gone to
the world championships,

1027
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:02,680
biggest event of the year on the planet
and he's supposed to go into the finals

1028
01:05:03,051 --> 01:05:06,380
and they call his name to go out to the
mat and he's asleep. And the bleachers,

1029
01:05:07,310 --> 01:05:10,870
they had to go shake him to wake
him up and he's sort of groggy,

1030
01:05:11,470 --> 01:05:13,990
rubbing his eyes, walks out. And
then as soon as he steps on the mat,

1031
01:05:14,590 --> 01:05:16,200
just different person,
I,

1032
01:05:16,210 --> 01:05:21,210
I totally that you get yourself into a
state of calmness and the ferocity we'll

1033
01:05:21,671 --> 01:05:24,360
take care of itself. I had a similar
thing I, the other day I was,

1034
01:05:24,361 --> 01:05:27,550
and playing in Seattle with the
Seattle symphony, they're doing,

1035
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:29,950
Ben Hurts a 90 minute
program with big orchestra,

1036
01:05:30,130 --> 01:05:34,930
really complex show my hotel rooms just
around the corner. So I go back after,

1037
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:36,130
you know,
rehearsal and I'm,

1038
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:40,500
and I set my alarm for six o'clock
and I got into a sneeze. Ah,

1039
01:05:40,501 --> 01:05:44,590
I set it for 6:00 AM not
pm. Ah. So I wake up,

1040
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:45,580
oh like that.

1041
01:05:45,581 --> 01:05:49,000
And I got a bit of a sandwich and I'm
chewing on the sandwich and I look at,

1042
01:05:49,270 --> 01:05:53,920
Oh shit. So I run, you know like Oh God,

1043
01:05:53,921 --> 01:05:54,760
Oh God,
Oh God,

1044
01:05:54,761 --> 01:05:59,590
Oh God the hell it and I'm on the 28th
floor elevator out of service down the

1045
01:05:59,610 --> 01:06:04,280
step up the hell do they
get get there like that. And

1046
01:06:07,140 --> 01:06:09,760
Ah, okay. Showtime.

1047
01:06:10,180 --> 01:06:12,160
Best show ever.

1048
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:19,633
Ladies and gentlemen.

1049
01:06:37,950 --> 01:06:41,340
Hey guys, this is Tim again. Just a
few more things before you take off.

1050
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:44,340
Number one,
this is five bullet Friday.

1051
01:06:44,610 --> 01:06:47,580
Do you want to get a short email from me?

1052
01:06:47,581 --> 01:06:51,720
Would you enjoy getting a short email
from me every Friday that provides a

1053
01:06:51,721 --> 01:06:55,260
little more soul of fun before the
weekend and five bullet Friday is a very

1054
01:06:55,261 --> 01:06:59,610
short email where I share the coolest
things I've found or that I've been

1055
01:06:59,611 --> 01:07:00,930
pondering over the week.

1056
01:07:01,140 --> 01:07:03,900
That could include favorite new
albums that I've discovered.

1057
01:07:03,901 --> 01:07:07,380
It could include Gizmos and gadgets
and all sorts of weird shit that I've

1058
01:07:07,381 --> 01:07:11,700
somehow dug up in the, uh, the
world of the esoteric as I do.

1059
01:07:11,970 --> 01:07:16,970
It could include favorite articles that
I've read and that I've shared with my

1060
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:20,370
close friends for instance,
and it's very short.

1061
01:07:20,430 --> 01:07:25,430
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness
before you head off for the weekend.

1062
01:07:25,470 --> 01:07:27,630
So if you want to receive that,
check it out.

1063
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:31,240
Just go to four hour work
week.com that's four hour work,

1064
01:07:31,241 --> 01:07:35,280
week.com all spelled out and just drop
in your email and you will get the very

1065
01:07:35,281 --> 01:07:37,830
next one if you sign up,
I hope you enjoy it.

1066
01:07:38,310 --> 01:07:40,710
This episode is brought
to you by kettle and fire,

1067
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:44,880
which makes some of the best bone broth
and certainly the most convenient that

1068
01:07:44,881 --> 01:07:49,881
I've ever found and I have a big stack
of them on my kitchen counter right now I

1069
01:07:50,131 --> 01:07:55,131
have one container every morning and this
first came highly recommended to me by

1070
01:07:56,160 --> 01:08:00,330
past podcast guests such as Amelia Boone
who is a four time world champion in

1071
01:08:00,331 --> 01:08:04,440
bolts, toughest mudder, Spartan
race, etc. And Dr Dominic D'agostino,

1072
01:08:04,441 --> 01:08:07,680
the incredible hulk of scientific
research. He's checking him out too.

1073
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:11,550
But there are few things that make a
kettle and fire special. Number one,

1074
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:13,890
they are the first shelf stable.
In other words,

1075
01:08:13,891 --> 01:08:17,690
never frozen bone broth that
uses bones from 100% grass fed,

1076
01:08:17,990 --> 01:08:22,280
organically raised animals.
So you are what you eat,

1077
01:08:22,910 --> 01:08:24,230
ate,
if that makes sense.

1078
01:08:24,231 --> 01:08:27,230
So it's very important that you understand
if you're consuming animal protein,

1079
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:31,730
what they consumed. They also use
longer cook times, 20 plus hours,

1080
01:08:31,731 --> 01:08:34,850
which means more collagen and
other nutrients. For instance,

1081
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:38,150
they contain it 19 times more Collagen,

1082
01:08:38,420 --> 01:08:42,830
then one of their close competitors
and an independent lab confirm this.

1083
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:46,340
I'll leave the competitor's name out
of it because I don't want to get sued,

1084
01:08:46,341 --> 01:08:49,670
but that's the case and it is not frozen.

1085
01:08:49,850 --> 01:08:52,550
So thanks to many millions of
dollars of packaging equipment.

1086
01:08:53,210 --> 01:08:57,050
They're bone broth doesn't require
freezing or shipping with dry ice.

1087
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:57,711
So like I said,

1088
01:08:57,711 --> 01:09:01,640
it's just sitting on my kitchen counter
in these boxes and then I can keep them

1089
01:09:01,641 --> 01:09:02,900
up.
They're basically ready to drink,

1090
01:09:02,990 --> 01:09:07,460
heat them up on the stove top or in a
microwave and you are ready to rock and

1091
01:09:07,461 --> 01:09:12,050
roll. And you'll also get a nice
payload of Glucosamine, glycine, uh,

1092
01:09:12,051 --> 01:09:16,370
along with the gelatin and everything
else that I mentioned. So check it out.

1093
01:09:16,980 --> 01:09:19,970
I've been hugely pleased
with this and like I said,

1094
01:09:19,971 --> 01:09:21,470
had been consuming it every morning.

1095
01:09:21,620 --> 01:09:24,410
It gives you about let's
say 20 grams of protein,

1096
01:09:24,411 --> 01:09:27,920
which is a nice little slow carb diet
boost. That's what you're looking for it.

1097
01:09:27,921 --> 01:09:29,120
And then I'll typically sip this,

1098
01:09:29,121 --> 01:09:34,121
have a very large camping coffee mug as
I do some writing or journaling so that

1099
01:09:36,020 --> 01:09:38,690
you'll have it. Check
it out. It's delicious.

1100
01:09:38,780 --> 01:09:42,210
I favor the chicken,
but uh,

1101
01:09:43,010 --> 01:09:46,610
each to his own or her own. So
check it out. Kettle and fire.com,

fire.com forward slash. Tip.

1104
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:59,320
It is very late at night.
I am packing for an island getaway.

1105
01:09:59,780 --> 01:10:00,441
Why does that matter?

1106
01:10:00,441 --> 01:10:05,441
Because it reminds me of one
of the sponsors for today's
podcast visiting Maine.

1107
01:10:05,630 --> 01:10:08,690
Why? Because the only dress
shirt that I'm taking,

1108
01:10:08,691 --> 01:10:11,720
I normally hate dress shirts
is from mizzen and main,

1109
01:10:11,721 --> 01:10:14,290
specifically the Becket Blue Gingham.

1110
01:10:15,050 --> 01:10:20,050
The reason or the reasons I should say
is because I can throw it in my bag and

1111
01:10:20,241 --> 01:10:22,400
the duffle,
not worry about ironing,

1112
01:10:22,550 --> 01:10:26,530
not worry about any kind of wrinkling
and then throw it on where it may be four

1113
01:10:26,531 --> 01:10:31,400
or five nights out of seven without
washing it. It won't smell antimicrobial.

1114
01:10:31,730 --> 01:10:35,930
It is made of stretch,
fabric, sweat wicking,

1115
01:10:36,230 --> 01:10:39,530
athletic. I could wear for a hike in
between dinners if I want to do it,

1116
01:10:39,531 --> 01:10:40,460
probably wouldn't do that.

1117
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:46,000
But mizzen and main has really delivered
on the all around all purpose dress

1118
01:10:46,761 --> 01:10:48,140
shirt.
They're fancy enough.

1119
01:10:48,141 --> 01:10:51,830
You can fool people into thinking
that you had them custom tailored,

1120
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:56,540
but they're also rough
enough and resilient enough
that you can toss them into

1121
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:58,370
the bottom of a duffle bag or backpack,

1122
01:10:58,490 --> 01:11:03,490
pull it off and put it on in
a bathroom at a restaurant.

1123
01:11:03,981 --> 01:11:07,820
Let's say hundreds of pro
athletes love this brand. Uh,

1124
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:12,470
people who don't fit well
into dress shirts, otherwise
like NFL Allpro, Jj Watt.

1125
01:11:12,860 --> 01:11:17,100
And the last time these guys were featured
on the show visit domain sold out of

1126
01:11:17,101 --> 01:11:19,890
every item that they featured. So if
you're interested in checking them out,

1127
01:11:20,220 --> 01:11:24,570
I had to recommend taking a look.
Just go to tim.blog forward slash shirts,

1128
01:11:24,930 --> 01:11:27,750
and you can see that one
shirt that I'm packing.

1129
01:11:27,751 --> 01:11:32,340
Then I always pack the Beckett
Hulu Gingham in addition
to a couple of my other

1130
01:11:32,341 --> 01:11:34,740
favorites.
And you can enter Tim,

1131
01:11:34,830 --> 01:11:37,620
that's Capitol Tim at
checkout for free shipping.

1132
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:43,100
If you use this code before September
15th it's 2017 to buy a dress shirt mizzen

1133
01:11:44,281 --> 01:11:44,581
and main,

1134
01:11:44,581 --> 01:11:48,900
we'll donate a brand new dress shirt to
the relief efforts in southern Texas.

1135
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:53,640
That's in addition to the thousand shirts
that are already being donated through

1136
01:11:53,641 --> 01:11:56,520
Jj Watson. Credible efforts
to put our, I should say,

1137
01:11:56,521 --> 01:11:59,730
where help Houston and the surrounding
communities get back on their feet.

1138
01:11:59,820 --> 01:12:02,160
So there you have it.
Check it out. Take a look.

1139
01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:05,280
Even if it's just to take
a peek at this one shirt,

1140
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:09,990
the Becket tim.blog/shirts.
Again, that's Tim dot.

1141
01:12:09,991 --> 01:12:11,940
Blog forward slash shirts.
