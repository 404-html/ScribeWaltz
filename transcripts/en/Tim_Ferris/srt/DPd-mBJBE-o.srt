1
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,050
Hey guys,
Tim Ferriss here.

2
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:14,820
I'm going to show you how I went from
very grumpy baby to slightly happier baby

3
00:00:14,821 --> 00:00:16,830
and for those of you don't
know what happy baby is,

4
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,850
it looks like this and
referred to a lot in yoga.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It's something like this and another
way to think of it would be like this,

6
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:32,280
this type of position, and I've always
had a lot of difficulty with it.

7
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,980
It's extremely important for a lot of
things, the highly specific acro yoga,

8
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:38,490
things like that,
which I'll show in a minute.

9
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:43,590
And then you have just general hip
health and there are many ways to improve

10
00:00:43,591 --> 00:00:48,360
that position. I stalled for probably
a year and a half, two years,

11
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,530
huge, huge pain and it turned out a few
things were very helpful for me. Waited,

12
00:00:52,531 --> 00:00:55,840
stretches, combined with
presses and a few other things.

13
00:00:55,841 --> 00:01:00,210
So I'm going to show you the sequence
that I have found most helpful and it's

14
00:01:00,211 --> 00:01:04,290
going to be within the context
of Acro Yoga. So Kipling,

15
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:09,840
this is a my friend Caitlin, Sag
Mueller at Kip Lynn, Kip, l. I n.

16
00:01:09,841 --> 00:01:13,290
N on all the socials.
Let's do some bird presses first.

17
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,520
So this is a position of
acro yoga called bird.

18
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,590
And I'm going to be policing my feet
basically on her hipbones right here.

19
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:26,430
So the middle of my feet are gonna be
right here and you'll see as I go through

20
00:01:26,431 --> 00:01:29,220
this what we're going to do this,
the safest way to get into it.

21
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,750
So we can do it with no hands if we
do it, no hands, it looks like that.

22
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,910
Okay. Generally if we come
down, we're going to use hands,

23
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:43,530
the Flyer, I'm the base flyer fingers
forward as a good way to remember it.

24
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:46,440
And we're just going to come up like that.

25
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:50,730
So very often I would do the presses
with the hands so that would look like

26
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,460
this.
Okay.

27
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:56,520
But I these days use it with no hands.

28
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,390
And when I do this,
I'm pointing with the toes slightly.

29
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:05,810
I'm bringing the knees down and I am
trying to keep my tailbone on the ground.

30
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:12,150
The temptation will be to roll up and I
want to try to keep this seated and then

31
00:02:12,151 --> 00:02:15,660
I will pull down with my
hands towards the ground.

32
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,920
And if your feet starts slipping out,
you can just correct with the hands.

33
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,160
You can squeeze the hand to indicate
where you want to place the weight,

34
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,700
readjust the foot where you just the foot.
And then we continue.

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,710
And I'll typically do
six repetitions of this.

36
00:02:28,711 --> 00:02:30,630
I'm only going to do two right now.

37
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:36,050
So we'd come down and you can kind of
play with the balance of feet pointing and

38
00:02:37,531 --> 00:02:38,364
so on.

39
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:43,200
And then coming back up to 90
degrees and I'll do one more.

40
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:48,330
And you can see,
you can kind of play with positioning,

41
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:53,390
really trying to pull down into
grab your baby slash have UV.

42
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,470
So that's part one.
All right.

43
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:00,980
Now what I've found is that just
putting yourself into this position for

44
00:03:02,711 --> 00:03:06,970
extended periods of time, it doesn't work
for me. So I will do six repetitions.

45
00:03:06,971 --> 00:03:11,440
You noticed five or six repetitions into
Max depth just for a second or two and

46
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:12,274
then out.

47
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:17,490
And what I found is that there's a
compression on the lag when my legs are

48
00:03:18,101 --> 00:03:20,530
straight. And I'll show you another
example of that and just a few minutes.

49
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,330
Then there's traction.

50
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:25,600
So Kimberly do you want to show just
the feet behind the hips? Traction.

51
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:31,650
So you can do this in as partners where
you turn the feet in and then she's just

52
00:03:32,471 --> 00:03:35,470
leaning back on my feet,
which is giving me a nice,

53
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,480
I'm going to traction the hips.

54
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:43,230
So I will do this in between
many of these exercises.

55
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,720
Thank you Kaitlin.
And I'll also do that for my wrists.

56
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:48,910
So this is not limited to the hips.

57
00:03:48,911 --> 00:03:53,911
I will get say a towel of some type and
I will pull on the fingers if I'm doing

58
00:03:54,851 --> 00:03:58,720
a lot of handstand work or something like
that. So this is all transferable. Okay,

59
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,570
so we have wordpress is number one.
Number two,

60
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:05,890
I'm working on internal and external
rotation of the leg in both lights

61
00:04:05,891 --> 00:04:06,724
independently.

62
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:11,730
So we're going to do a cartwheel into
side star and I'll also show you some

63
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:14,980
stuff that is not accurate dependent,

64
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:20,400
but so if we come up and then
we'll go onto the opposite side

65
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,550
here.
All right,

66
00:04:23,551 --> 00:04:28,300
so I'm getting this compression on a
single leg and you'll notice that Kip Lynn

67
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:32,560
has effectively 90 degree angle
between her legs here. This, this foot,

68
00:04:32,561 --> 00:04:34,240
the bottom foot is actually
very close to the ground.

69
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,050
Okay?
And

70
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,800
we'll do generally a five to six reps
on either side is what I typically do.

71
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:49,240
This part of the warm up. All right?
So then we're going to cartwheel out.

72
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:55,710
Now what we're gonna do is instead of
having a good amount of extra rotation and

73
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,230
we focused on internal rotation and a,

74
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,810
we will do that going from the bird
position, which you've already seen,

75
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:04,080
two of these slightly
different type of sides to her.

76
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:09,610
So from here

77
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:15,180
I'm going to coq one foot out and then
Katelyn is going to slide onto that foot

78
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:16,820
and you'll see how she
uses her arm support,

79
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:18,603
no,

80
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,950
this. Then we get this rotation and
this internal rotation on this leg.

81
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,560
Now when I come back,
watch how I bend my legs,

82
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,780
I'm going to push with the support leg
and catch with the other foot and we come

83
00:05:32,781 --> 00:05:35,300
up.
Then internal rotation.

84
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:42,820
This one is very tough for a lot of women
and a lot of guys in particular guys

85
00:05:43,611 --> 00:05:46,850
with stiff hips don't rotate worth a damn.

86
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,040
It's a very therapeutic exercise.

87
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:53,810
Also teaches you how to have soft feet
if you're doing more accurate yoga or

88
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:57,140
anything that includes some

89
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:03,720
of hamstring flexibility.
Okay, let's dispel it.

90
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:05,860
So we come down.
All right.

91
00:06:05,861 --> 00:06:10,861
So I want to show a few things that are
not accurate dependent that I sometimes

92
00:06:12,251 --> 00:06:16,450
do in between these exercises.
So one of them I'll come over.

93
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:18,933
Okay,

94
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,433
is this,

95
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:25,060
so this is a rad roller and uh,

96
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,910
the one of the guests on my podcast,
a Amelia Boone,

97
00:06:27,911 --> 00:06:32,740
who is the world's most successful female
obstacle course racer taught me and as

98
00:06:32,741 --> 00:06:35,140
did coach summer.
So Chris Sommer,

99
00:06:35,141 --> 00:06:38,860
former national team coach for men's
gymnastics in the u s that people think of

100
00:06:38,861 --> 00:06:42,450
hamstring flexibility. Oftentimes
the restrictions that are like, oh,

101
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,750
I can't touch my toes are related
to the lower legs and the feet.

102
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:49,840
So I will roll out my feet

103
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,730
like cell and I'll travel
with this rad roller.

104
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:57,460
This is not very exciting to watch,
but you'll get the idea.

105
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:02,200
So food is right in the middle here and
I'll generally do it very slowly and

106
00:07:02,201 --> 00:07:05,050
then I'll caulk it out like so.

107
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,460
And then in and uh,
you can,

108
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:12,790
you can accelerate a lot of your
hamstring flexibility progress.

109
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:17,260
So I will do this on the feet also very
good for the forearms and you can roll

110
00:07:17,261 --> 00:07:20,500
them on the floor when you're doing a lot
of handstand or straight or port. Okay,

111
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,490
a good idea.
I don't always do this,

112
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,880
but it's tuning gorge to the calves and
stretch the Achilles and the calves.

113
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:31,780
Before you do your hamstring work, it
was making a lot easier. All right,

114
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:35,940
now I'll show you a few things,
uh,

115
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:39,830
because I will often take a break before
the next one because I find it have

116
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,700
found it historically very difficult.
It's getting a lot easier. Uh,

117
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:47,610
other things that I will do is I'll focus
on back rotation also to get the mid

118
00:07:47,611 --> 00:07:50,650
back and traps and lats engaged.

119
00:07:50,651 --> 00:07:55,651
But this is a kind of a modified
like mark for Stagen type movement.

120
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:59,380
I think Eric Cressey also uses
something very similar. Uh,

121
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:02,320
I will get into this
type of lunge position.

122
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:06,730
What's very important is that my
hips are square. I'm not doing this,

123
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,300
I'm not doing this.
It's not a warrior post type of thing.

124
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,920
The toes are pointing straight ahead.

125
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:17,340
And then what I'll do is simply drop this
elbow flat to the ground and then come

126
00:08:17,711 --> 00:08:21,550
up,
pinch this leg in and wrote good.

127
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:26,920
And then if that is easy, I'll just
inch the foot forward and do it again.

128
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,250
And as per usual,

129
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:34,930
I will do probably six of these,
right?

130
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,330
And that you would just
do it on the opposite side

131
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:52,370
and we're just going to kind of match
range for a second and then write out,

132
00:08:52,371 --> 00:08:55,860
we're not staying for 30 seconds
or on staying for two minutes, uh,

133
00:08:55,861 --> 00:09:00,360
that there are options for
that, but I don't do them as
part of this warmup. Okay.

134
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:06,330
And once we've done all that,
there is one last that I would recommend,

135
00:09:06,331 --> 00:09:10,110
especially for guys. And this is just
a general warmup, uh, recommendation,

136
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,670
sort of just stretching this way,
stretching this way,

137
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,800
focusing on what we just did,

138
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:20,310
just rotation and an easy way to do that.

139
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,630
He's like this and this is,
I'm going to blank on his last name.

140
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:27,810
I Apologize Steve. I want to say Steve
Sydell but I don't think that's right.

141
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:32,460
Steve, who's basically the team
doc, also a competitor at parody.

142
00:09:32,461 --> 00:09:35,220
So crossfit in Venice
should me this tweak,

143
00:09:35,221 --> 00:09:38,710
which is not just in free
standing or free, uh,

144
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,770
squatting rotation, but using a
wall to ensure that you don't sheet,

145
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,980
that your hips don't translate.
So in this case, I have my hip,

146
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:51,000
my shoulder peg to the wall and I'm
just going to be crawling down and then

147
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:55,290
coming straight up. And I asked him,
well, if you have pain in your back,

148
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:58,380
had you know if you should
do the exercise or not.

149
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:03,420
And his answer was if it
feels better as you go after,

150
00:10:03,421 --> 00:10:05,760
say five repetitions and your
range of motion has increased,

151
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:08,460
that means you do the
movement. Uh, so that is that.

152
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:13,670
And then the final move that I'll show
you is called a well one is a star press

153
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,810
and then you have a walk to star
and I'll show you what that is.

154
00:10:18,811 --> 00:10:22,020
So I like to start with the negative.
What does that mean? Negative,

155
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:25,770
we have concentric and
then East centric movement.

156
00:10:25,771 --> 00:10:29,790
So the concentric movement you
can see the Bicep is contracting,

157
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,020
it's getting shorter.

158
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:35,820
Then as you lower it's getting longer.

159
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,680
That's the East centric or negative.

160
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:42,630
So I start with negatives with
star and then go to walk ups and,

161
00:10:42,631 --> 00:10:44,430
and we'll, we'll, I'll show
you exactly what that is.

162
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,570
So probably good to face this way
to show this.

163
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,120
All right, so the hand grip, for those of
you who might be wondering is like this,

164
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:59,180
this is the grip that we're using a sort
of two fingers on the wrist and then

165
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:05,220
the hands wrapped as so, and we're
trying to maintain a comfortable angle.

166
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,990
This is flat.
This is steep,

167
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:10,380
usually end up somewhere in between and
you'd just like dancing with a partner.

168
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,630
We've figured out so what
grip works for us. Okay.

169
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,533
All right,

170
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:25,760
so this is star and very often the hands
or the arms of the flyer and this case

171
00:11:26,461 --> 00:11:29,600
Kipling are going to be
straight. They can be bent. Um,

172
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:33,210
we can do some crazy stuff like Freestar
which we don't have to do right now,

173
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:36,420
which is no hands. Uh, but the presses,

174
00:11:36,421 --> 00:11:41,421
so the negative I mentioned just going
to lower like so and then all right,

175
00:11:44,461 --> 00:11:48,390
back up. I'm going to do the
same on the opposite side.

176
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:53,830
Just like that. He notices this
very grumpy baby and then we come up

177
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,970
and then from here I would do that
probably two or three reps and other side.

178
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:58,630
And then we're just going to [inaudible]

179
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:03,630
walk down to that.

180
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:08,110
This is bad or straddle that. Then
we're going to do a walk up. All right,

181
00:12:08,111 --> 00:12:10,150
so this will be pretty self explanatory,

182
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:17,350
just like so.
And you just do that

183
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,810
on both sides.
So I'm just

184
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,530
going to pop just for fun

185
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:31,130
and then I'll show you guys what a pop
is just for fun. Don't try this at home.

186
00:12:31,131 --> 00:12:32,570
He need professional supervision.

187
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,840
Ready? One, two,

188
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:40,230
and then you can get that pet

189
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:44,790
and that. Ladies and gents, especially
if you're utilizing Acroyoga,

190
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:48,200
which I think is a great way
to improve hip health, uh,

191
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:52,520
for El basing when I was doing
that is how you can go over time,

192
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:56,900
but pretty quickly in my case,
from very grumpy baby, too happy.

193
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:59,390
Maybe if you enjoyed this video,

194
