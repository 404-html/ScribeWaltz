1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,870
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02,871 --> 00:00:06,050
I can run flat out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,690
I'm a cybernetic organism
living this yoga.

4
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:27,500
This episode is brought to you
by we work. I love, we work.

5
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:32,330
I haven't had an office in many,
many, many, many, many years.

6
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:37,360
Since 2000 or so when I had my last
real job I suppose and quotation marks,

7
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:42,050
but when I moved from San Francisco
to Austin, not long guy decided,

8
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,910
you know what?
I'm tired of working at home.

9
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:45,890
I'm tired or we're going to coffee shops.

10
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:50,480
So one of the very first things I
did was to get a space at we work.

11
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,300
I could not be happier with
this change in my life.

12
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:57,860
We work is a global network of workspaces
where companies and people grow

13
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:01,700
together. The idea is really simple.
You focus on your business and we work,

14
00:01:01,701 --> 00:01:05,900
takes care of all of the rest,
including front desk service, utilities,

15
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,580
refreshments,
and more.

16
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:12,260
I also often have things shipped from
Amazon and elsewhere to my office that we

17
00:01:12,261 --> 00:01:13,610
work here in Austin.

18
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,900
I've been completely blown away
by the members only events,

19
00:01:17,901 --> 00:01:19,130
special offers,

20
00:01:19,131 --> 00:01:23,240
and perhaps the best cold brew
coffee on tap that I've ever had.

21
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:25,490
It's been amazing.
It's been a real,

22
00:01:25,491 --> 00:01:30,180
real change in my life and improved my
quality of life and there are also dog

23
00:01:30,181 --> 00:01:33,830
friendly, we work locations all
over the place. How Fun is that?

24
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:38,270
We work caters to everyone
from entrepreneurs and
freelancers to start ups and

25
00:01:38,271 --> 00:01:42,750
even large enterprises including Ge,
salesforce, Microsoft, mastercard,

26
00:01:42,751 --> 00:01:47,360
Samsung, Spotify, Pinterest and red
bull among many others. In fact,

27
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:51,050
more than 10% of fortune
500 companies currently use.

28
00:01:51,051 --> 00:01:54,170
We work and it's a rapidly growing group.
In other words,

29
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:58,850
it's not just solar printers and to
ground level startups that use we work,

30
00:01:58,851 --> 00:02:03,851
but everything from that to
the big companies who are
seeing very huge benefits

31
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,713
as well.

32
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,960
We work believes that creating spaces
where people can connect and create

33
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:13,760
meaning together, right? After all, if
you are someone who has built a business,

34
00:02:13,761 --> 00:02:16,700
modeled on the principles and the
four hour workweek where elsewhere,

35
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,790
it can be a lonely road. Sometimes
even though you're digitally connected,

36
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:21,530
it can feel very,
very isolating.

37
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:26,140
So in these spaces you can
connect with real humans and uh,

38
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:30,110
all the while you space more
efficiently and cost effectively,

39
00:02:30,111 --> 00:02:33,800
which makes you and your business better
equipped to face the challenges of

40
00:02:33,801 --> 00:02:37,730
today and tomorrow.
We work now has more than 200 locations,

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,820
so you can find great
spots all over the world.

42
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:45,970
So head over to we.co/tim that's we dot
Cosio so we.co/tim to become a part of

43
00:02:49,671 --> 00:02:52,490
the global we were community.
At the very least.

44
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:56,030
I encourage you to check out pictures of
some of the locations around the world.

45
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,910
There are some incredible spots.
So check it.

46
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:01,720
[inaudible] dot co slash Tim

47
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:10,100
this episode is brought to you by Peloton
and I'd heard about Peloton over and

48
00:03:10,101 --> 00:03:10,910
over again,

49
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:15,830
but I ended up getting a Peloton bike
in the whole system after I saw my buddy

50
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:18,950
Kevin Rose, I've known him
forever, some of you know,

51
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:23,980
and he showed up at my gate at my house
a while back and he looked fantastic.

52
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,240
I asked him, I said, dude, you look
great. What the hell have you been up to?

53
00:03:29,241 --> 00:03:31,370
Because he's always doing
a weird diet or another,

54
00:03:31,371 --> 00:03:32,930
but it only lasts like a week or two.

55
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,740
So he always regresses to the mean
after like 75 beers and he said,

56
00:03:36,741 --> 00:03:39,290
I've been doing peloton five days a week.
Now.

57
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:44,000
That caught my attention because Kevin
does nothing five days a week and you

58
00:03:44,001 --> 00:03:47,270
know, I love you Kevin, but
it really peaked my curiosity.

59
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:52,300
Ended up getting a system and it's
become an integral part of my week.

60
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:57,200
I love it and I really didn't expect to
love it at all because I find cycling

61
00:03:57,201 --> 00:03:58,880
really boring usually.

62
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:03,890
But peloton is an indoor cycling bike
that brings live studio classes right into

63
00:04:03,891 --> 00:04:04,970
your home.
You know,

64
00:04:04,971 --> 00:04:08,360
if worry about fitting classes into your
schedule or making it to a studio with

65
00:04:08,361 --> 00:04:09,320
some type of commute,

66
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:13,880
etc. New classes are added every day and
this includes options led by elite New

67
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,350
York City instructors
in your own living room.

68
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,100
You can even live stream studio classes
taught by the world's best instructors

69
00:04:19,101 --> 00:04:22,400
or find your own favorite class on demand.
And in fact,

70
00:04:22,401 --> 00:04:26,600
Kevin and I rarely do live classes
and you can compete with your friends,

71
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,190
which is also fun.
Kevin,

72
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:32,390
I'm coming after you but we
usually just use classes on demand.

73
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:37,430
I really like Matt Wilbur's and his eye
in high intensity training sessions that

74
00:04:37,431 --> 00:04:42,431
are shorter like 20 minutes and I think
Kevin's favorite is Alex and everyone

75
00:04:43,221 --> 00:04:47,810
seems to have their favorite instructor
or you can select by music duration and

76
00:04:47,811 --> 00:04:48,644
so on.

77
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:53,690
Each Peloton bike includes a 22 inch HD
touchscreen performance tracking metrics.

78
00:04:53,691 --> 00:04:58,310
I think that along with the realtime
leaderboard are the main reasons that this

79
00:04:58,311 --> 00:05:02,690
caught my attention when cycling
never had caught my attention before.

80
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,200
It's really pretty stunning what they've
done with the user interface to keep

81
00:05:06,201 --> 00:05:07,034
your attention.

82
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:11,090
The belt drive is quiet and it's smaller
than you would expect so it can fit in

83
00:05:11,091 --> 00:05:15,080
a living room or an office.
I actually have it in a large closet,

84
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:18,500
believe it or not and
it fits with no problem.

85
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:23,510
So peloton is offering all of you guys,
listeners of the Tim Ferriss show,

86
00:05:23,511 --> 00:05:28,511
a special offer and it is actually
special visit one Peloton that's o,

with your Peloton bike purchase.

89
00:05:40,221 --> 00:05:42,350
Now you might say ma accessories.
Wait,

90
00:05:42,351 --> 00:05:46,970
I don't need fancy towels or whatever
other supplemental bits and pieces.

91
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,190
No,
the shoes you need,

92
00:05:49,191 --> 00:05:52,220
you need the clip in shoes and
those are in the accessory category.

93
00:05:52,221 --> 00:05:55,760
So there's $100 off is
a very legit $100 off.

102

Okay.

103
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:34,020
Hello boys and girls.

104
00:06:34,021 --> 00:06:37,620
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another
episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

105
00:06:37,621 --> 00:06:42,621
it is typically my job to deconstruct
world class performers of different types

106
00:06:42,721 --> 00:06:45,270
and tease out the habits,
routines, favorite books,

107
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,330
and so on so that you can
apply them to your own life.

108
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,250
This episode is going to
be a little bit different.

109
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,200
So if you want the long form interviews,

110
00:06:52,201 --> 00:06:57,201
go back a few episodes or go to tim.blog
forts as Jamie for Jimmy Fox or Jocko

111
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,230
Willink,

112
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:03,000
tim.blog/jocko or whatever
might tickle your fancy.

113
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:06,990
This episode is going to be in
response to many, many, many,

114
00:07:06,991 --> 00:07:11,070
many requests related to my first book,
the four hour Workweek,

115
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:16,130
which recently celebrated
its 10th anniversary and
thousands of you have asked

116
00:07:16,531 --> 00:07:21,531
me how I would update the four hour
workweek today and you've also asked why I

117
00:07:22,081 --> 00:07:25,490
have not already updated
the four hour work week,

118
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:30,710
which I did do in fact two years after
2007 and 2009 but why haven't I since and

119
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,220
to answer those questions and many more.

120
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:39,450
I sat down for an interview where
Ashley asked one of my friends, Adam,

121
00:07:39,451 --> 00:07:42,840
to interview me to
discuss common questions,

122
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:47,870
misperceptions as well as how I would
walk someone through the book today,

123
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,360
what I might expand if I were to at
the age of 40 as opposed to 29 expand

124
00:07:55,171 --> 00:07:57,390
certain chapters and so on.
So if that's of interest,

125
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,280
then I think this episode we'll have
something for you and if not the long form

126
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:06,600
interviews, we'll return the
very next episode. And as always,

127
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,400
thank you so much for listening.

128
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:15,860
I am not Tim Ferriss, but I am
asking questions to Tim Ferris. It's,

129
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:18,260
it's very meta.
All right Tim,

130
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:23,360
more than 10 years ago,
four hour work week comes out.

131
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:26,570
It's published 10 years later.

132
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,210
It is still the most
quoted book on Amazon.

133
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,510
Why has the book had such longevity?

134
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:40,120
This is a curious question.
The,

135
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:46,530
the answer is in brief. I'm not sure, uh,

136
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:51,600
but I would say that if I had to
speculate and come up with something,

137
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,880
I would say I wrote the

138
00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:01,190
very personally to two of my friends
and the backstory on that is when I was

139
00:09:03,091 --> 00:09:07,970
writing the book and there there are many
plausible other explanations and that

140
00:09:07,971 --> 00:09:11,250
the four hour workweek is a title
gets a lot of people to buy the book.

141
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,870
And due to the volume of sales,

142
00:09:12,871 --> 00:09:16,230
there's a high potential for highlighting
since it is a nonfiction how to book

143
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,190
right. Whereas people are less
inclined to highlight a fiction book,

144
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:24,960
even if it is a thousand times more
popular than the four hour work week.

145
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:27,270
There are many plausible explanations,

146
00:09:27,271 --> 00:09:31,830
but if I had to take a stab at how
the content or the writing style might

147
00:09:31,831 --> 00:09:36,470
contribute, I would say that when
I started writing the book and uh,

148
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:38,220
it was largely written in Argentina,

149
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:42,720
went back to Winos IRA is where
I lived for nine months in 2004,

150
00:09:42,721 --> 00:09:44,700
2005 to right.

151
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:49,140
And the first attempt failed completely.

152
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:53,790
I had four or five chapters
that were very academic.

153
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:58,410
I was trying very hard to sound smart
and not say I never do that now,

154
00:09:58,411 --> 00:10:03,411
but it was really awful to read just
three syllable words where one sober words

155
00:10:05,191 --> 00:10:08,130
would suffice and it was awful.
Uh,

156
00:10:08,131 --> 00:10:12,330
which I think I actually
developed in college.

157
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:16,950
I think that in the process of writing
papers there, I developed that habit.

158
00:10:16,951 --> 00:10:19,830
So I threw out those four chapters,
four or five chapters.

159
00:10:19,831 --> 00:10:24,831
Then I went the opposite direction and
tried to make it slapstick funny and

160
00:10:25,951 --> 00:10:30,870
really fast and loose and it was equally
bad just for different reasons and

161
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:35,400
impart both of those failed because
I was writing for a broad audience.

162
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:40,080
I was trying to write for as many
people as possible and I couldn't do it.

163
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,390
Certainly couldn't do it well,
maybe other people can.

164
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:47,391
So I sat down and actually opened up a
window to compose an email and started as

165
00:10:48,511 --> 00:10:52,380
a first draft, at least writing
a chapter two, two of my friends,

166
00:10:52,381 --> 00:10:54,960
one who was trapped in a
company of his own making

167
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,490
and felt like he couldn't leave.
He couldn't kill his baby,

168
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,410
it wouldn't run without him,
et Cetera,

169
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,180
which was the exact
situation I had been in.

170
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:08,650
And another friend who is working at a
bank and was becoming a victim of his own

171
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,170
success.

172
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:15,170
You had no time and was
deciding to increases burn
rate by things he didn't need

173
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:22,620
to justify how much time you spent
working felt similarly trapped.

174
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,410
And these were guys
around my age at the time,

175
00:11:25,411 --> 00:11:30,411
29 or so of 29 30 and I knew them really
well because I was effectively them.

176
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:37,410
I mean we had so much shared experience,
so much your DNA, so many shared goals,

177
00:11:37,411 --> 00:11:40,530
aspirations, problems. And
so I've, I wrote a very,

178
00:11:40,531 --> 00:11:44,130
very personal book ultimately
with two friends in mind.

179
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:48,930
And I think that the
feedback I very often get,

180
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:53,590
I don't think I know feedback very often
get with the book is I felt like you

181
00:11:53,591 --> 00:11:54,640
were writing it just to me.

182
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:56,370
Okay.

183
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:59,760
And I had a very,
very narrow focus to begin with.

184
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:04,770
Meaning I'm writing for effectively
people who have very similar life

185
00:12:04,771 --> 00:12:09,300
circumstances or goals,
aspirations, fears, trappings.

186
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:14,370
And it was
by definition,

187
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:19,170
if you look at who's writing the book
going to be males in a fairly narrow age

188
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:21,450
range who are tech savvy,

189
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,020
very interested in a handful of things.
But it's important to realize that the,

190
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:30,060
the target isn't the market.
And this is not something I made up.

191
00:12:30,061 --> 00:12:32,090
I don't know who originally
to attribute it to,

192
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:37,100
but my original target just so I could
write effectively from my own experience

193
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,650
was that group.
But as soon as it came out,

194
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:45,720
then it immediately bled over into women
who fit the same psychographics and so

195
00:12:45,721 --> 00:12:49,380
on. And then it started to bleed
out by age. And now if I go,

196
00:12:49,381 --> 00:12:54,381
I've been to commencement speeches where
the the parents or grandparents will

197
00:12:54,511 --> 00:12:59,400
come over and ask me about the four hour
work week because they read it and then

198
00:12:59,401 --> 00:13:01,140
I have high school students
who are reading it.

199
00:13:01,141 --> 00:13:05,250
So the original market was very,
very,

200
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:08,970
very narrow.
That does not mean in some cases,

201
00:13:08,971 --> 00:13:12,030
certainly in the case of this book
that it can't expand later. Uh,

202
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,070
that's my best guess.

203
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:20,160
That's my best guess is that it's very
personally written and it's also in the

204
00:13:20,201 --> 00:13:22,990
category of advice how to nonfiction,

205
00:13:22,991 --> 00:13:26,110
which is prone to receiving more
highlights. Right. To begin with.

206
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:31,390
So I know you've been asked many times,

207
00:13:31,391 --> 00:13:36,391
and I've thought about it as well about
updating the book because a lot has

208
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:39,880
changed in,
in more than 10 years.

209
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:45,120
But I also know as as everyone else
that you have held back on that urge.

210
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:51,390
Why is it that you have decided at least
so far to not make any changes to the

211
00:13:52,061 --> 00:13:53,350
book and updated?

212
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,880
Yeah, this is a good question. There are,

213
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:01,390
this is something that I have had a
tremendous amount of internal debate about

214
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:05,200
and internal conflict about.
On one hand,

215
00:14:05,201 --> 00:14:10,201
I really want to provide the latest
and greatest and cutting edge to my

216
00:14:10,841 --> 00:14:15,160
audience. On the other hand, in the
format of a book that is a losing battle.

217
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:19,600
It is a fool's errand because as soon
as I update the tech and the tools,

218
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:24,820
it will be outdated six months later.
It would need to be completely rewritten,

219
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,080
uh, in most cases. So if we
look at the four hour work week,

220
00:14:29,081 --> 00:14:34,081
I would say there are few levels to the
framework and strategies and advice.

221
00:14:35,351 --> 00:14:36,184
In the book,

222
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,690
you have principles to
the first principles,

223
00:14:40,691 --> 00:14:43,660
like ordering principles
that are the most important.

224
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:48,250
If you understand those principles, you
can usually come up with SEI strategies,

225
00:14:48,251 --> 00:14:51,590
which are broad approaches to solving
certain problems, maybe even frameworks.

226
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:55,190
So we could call also the principles,
core beliefs or assumptions.

227
00:14:55,191 --> 00:14:58,670
Let's just say then you have it
or if then statements, right?

228
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,380
Then you have the strategies which are,

229
00:15:00,381 --> 00:15:02,600
we'll given those assumptions
and first principles.

230
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,010
Here are the broad strategies which do
not include tools or specific tactics.

231
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:12,470
Then you go up a level and you have
tools and tactics. For instance,

232
00:15:12,471 --> 00:15:14,300
using Google adwords to test,

233
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:19,360
which was very effective and one
of the primary options at the time,

234
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:25,950
the four hour workweek was
published that would now be at,

235
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:31,130
at the very least supplemented with safe
Facebook advertising and other types of

236
00:15:31,671 --> 00:15:35,840
contextual advertising and
testing and so on and so forth.

237
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:36,740
There are many,

238
00:15:36,741 --> 00:15:41,741
many more platform options and testing
options than existed when the book was

239
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:46,990
first published in 2007 meaning the
book was written in 2005 2006 right?

240
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,920
It was updated in 2009 so
it's moderately updated,

241
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:57,760
but the the tools and tactics
are always going to change.

242
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:01,670
And for that reason,
I encourage people,

243
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:05,660
and the reason I haven't updated those
in the written format in the book thus

244
00:16:05,661 --> 00:16:08,780
far is that if you understand the
focus on the principles and strategies,

245
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,550
you can figure out the tools and tactics.

246
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:13,760
And in fact you're going to have to do
that if you're going to choose to be an

247
00:16:13,761 --> 00:16:15,710
entrepreneur or someone to
make something from nothing.

248
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:21,610
Let's just say very broadly speaking or
someone who moves assets and resources

249
00:16:21,801 --> 00:16:24,770
from an area of low economic yield
to an area of high economic yield,

250
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,740
which was the, one of the
original definitions from JB say,

251
00:16:27,741 --> 00:16:28,640
I believe his name was,

252
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:32,960
you are going to have to become very
good at improvising and problem solving.

253
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:37,490
So if you're not willing to figure
out the tools and tactics on your own,

254
00:16:37,491 --> 00:16:39,350
I would say you were ill equipped at,

255
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:44,470
or unwilling to be what it is required
to achieve any mode come of success as an

256
00:16:45,051 --> 00:16:47,030
entrepreneur. Right?
And that's not just me.

257
00:16:47,031 --> 00:16:50,030
Absolving myself with the responsibility
of updating the principles and the

258
00:16:50,031 --> 00:16:54,020
strategies are very
important. 80 20 analysis. Uh,

259
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:56,480
let's just say some assumptions
which could be falsified,

260
00:16:56,481 --> 00:17:01,481
but that time is the most
valuable nonrenewable resource
compared to say income,

261
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:04,820
right? All of these then
inform the later decisions.

262
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:10,100
So book is not the best format for
tracking technology. Nonetheless,

263
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:13,610
it would be nice to update but it
would be better done via some type of

264
00:17:13,611 --> 00:17:16,610
community online or online repository.

265
00:17:16,611 --> 00:17:20,840
I tried that with a forum and it
turned into, as you're well aware,

266
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:26,270
a gigantic pain in the ass
headache. So I euthanized that. Uh,

267
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:31,130
the other piece of it is part two.

268
00:17:31,131 --> 00:17:35,660
So if part one is tools and tactics change
too quickly and I would have to put a

269
00:17:35,661 --> 00:17:39,590
lot of effort into updating,
that would immediately be obsolescence.

270
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:43,430
The second piece of it is looking back,

271
00:17:43,431 --> 00:17:45,320
say at the four hour workweek.

272
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,260
There are parts of it that
make me cringe a little bit.

273
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:52,350
Not that I regret having
written it the way I wrote it,

274
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:57,680
but the 29 year old Tim Ferriss felt like
he had a lot to prove and he did have

275
00:17:58,921 --> 00:17:59,700
a lot to prove.

276
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,420
I mean there are the hundreds of
thousands of books published every year.

277
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:07,710
And I had at that time,
no media training.

278
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:11,730
I was utterly unprepared for everything
that transpired because the initial

279
00:18:11,731 --> 00:18:15,360
print, well the book was first
of all turned down by 27,

280
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:20,220
I think it's 27 publishers,
just a few violently in some cases.

281
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:23,880
And then the initial print run
was between 10 and 12,000 copies.

282
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:27,240
You couldn't even get it in
many places in the u s alone.

283
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:31,080
The book was not expected to do much
at all and therefore I was completely

284
00:18:31,081 --> 00:18:36,060
unprepared for everything that
came afterward in writing the book.

285
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:40,040
Also in writing for my two friends,
uh,

286
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:46,550
I was very much myself at the
time and myself at the time,

287
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:51,870
had a bit of chest puffing,
a very hyper aggressive,

288
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,890
uh,
and looking back,

289
00:18:55,891 --> 00:18:59,910
if I were to edit the book now,
it would have a very different voice.

290
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:05,250
It would have a very different tone,
have a very different feel. But

291
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,530
the four hour work week now has been
translated into more than 40 languages.

292
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:15,090
It is almost always in the top 100
top 200 on Amazon. Like you said,

293
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:18,930
for 2017 it was the most highlighted
book across all of Amazon,

294
00:19:18,931 --> 00:19:21,930
which was even to me a big surprise.

295
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:25,890
And there's a certain,

296
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,190
for lack of a better word,

297
00:19:29,191 --> 00:19:34,140
there's certain magic or alchemy in that
book that made it click and still makes

298
00:19:34,141 --> 00:19:36,600
it click 10 years later that
I don't want to fuck with.

299
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:40,320
I'm really afraid that if I go
in there and start tinkering,

300
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:43,260
that I'm going to step on the
butterfly that then, you know,

301
00:19:43,261 --> 00:19:48,261
causes like I a hurricane on the other
side of the world within the book,

302
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:51,780
that that somehow affects
what that book is done.

303
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:57,190
And
if it's not broken,

304
00:19:57,191 --> 00:19:58,300
I don't want to try to fix it.

305
00:19:58,301 --> 00:20:02,230
So that's another reason why if we look
at not just the tools and resources and

306
00:20:02,231 --> 00:20:05,770
so on,
if I were to go into the book,

307
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:09,820
I worry that I would tinker
in a way that would damage it.

308
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:15,280
And if people want to read
the later, Tim, they can.

309
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:17,480
It's very easy. You just
read the later books, right?

310
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,910
Each of those books is a snapshot of me
at a very particular point in my life

311
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:24,910
and although I wouldn't view
them as autobiographical,

312
00:20:24,911 --> 00:20:29,200
they absolutely capture a lot of my goals,
priorities,

313
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:33,340
neuroses,
and so on of a given point in my life.

314
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:38,650
Uh, so those are a few of the reasons
why I have chosen not to update the book.

315
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:45,030
If there was a section or two which
you've been asked a thousand or two times

316
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:48,243
two update,

317
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:54,220
is there anything that comes to mind
that now feels a little outdated and son

318
00:20:54,221 --> 00:20:57,280
that when you think of today what
you were doing, you would be like,

319
00:20:57,310 --> 00:21:00,880
you know what,
here's how I would refresh that section.

320
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:06,100
There are
a few sections.

321
00:21:06,101 --> 00:21:10,180
I say broadly speaking, since the four
hour work weeks broken into definition,

322
00:21:10,181 --> 00:21:13,180
elimination, automation,
liberation, the automation section,

323
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:18,370
which talks about business
process outsourcing delegation,

324
00:21:18,371 --> 00:21:21,820
the tools that can be used for that,
uh,

325
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,960
certainly the testing components of
what we might call now developing,

326
00:21:30,191 --> 00:21:34,810
launching, iterating on a minimally,
a minimum viable product, MVP.

327
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:41,460
Those could all be updated and I left
out another reason why updating is

328
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:45,850
challenging and I would
take it one step further.

329
00:21:45,851 --> 00:21:49,690
We're talking about tools and tactics,
right? Right. We come down a level,

330
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:54,100
let's consider the principles and
strategies. Let's take art as an example.

331
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:55,600
Drawing.
All right,

332
00:21:55,601 --> 00:22:00,250
so you might have certain principles and
organizing principles which are beliefs

333
00:22:00,251 --> 00:22:05,251
about materials and two d and so on
for charcoal or some type of drawing.

334
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,090
Then you have strategies or
just composition and so on.

335
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,180
Then you have the tools given
pens, pencils, and so on.

336
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,820
Given my audience right now,

337
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:20,710
if I recommend a given pen,
right,

338
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:23,710
it is almost certainly
immediately going to be sold out.

339
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:29,790
That problem which has been nicknamed
the hug of death by some of my fans

340
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:33,130
applies even more so to services.

341
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:38,160
So if I recommend a given service that
currently has a few thousand users or

342
00:22:38,471 --> 00:22:41,590
even tens of thousands and then they
get hit by a million or 2 million,

343
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,020
it can absolutely destroy the service,

344
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:49,290
particularly if it's not automated and
there's some type of client interaction

345
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:53,080
or customer service. If there is a manual
component, I can completely destroy it.

346
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,030
So I am,

347
00:22:56,590 --> 00:23:01,000
I am loath to in some cases
recommend any particular,

348
00:23:01,001 --> 00:23:04,150
I get asked all the time, all right,
which outsourcing service should I use?

349
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:07,090
I would like to get a virtual
assistant in the Philippines or India.

350
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,290
Who should I use?
Well,

351
00:23:08,291 --> 00:23:13,291
I've made those recommendations in the
past and within a week they go from five

352
00:23:13,511 --> 00:23:18,280
out of five star in customer service
to one out of five star. Right? Why?

353
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:23,310
Because they suddenly have to 10 x their
client capacity overnight and very few

354
00:23:24,101 --> 00:23:26,960
service businesses are equipped
to handle that. Almost none.

355
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:32,870
But if I had a gun to the
head and had to update, uh,

356
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:37,750
particularly with tools
that can handle and scale,

357
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:40,050
maybe they're based on AWS or otherwise,
right?

358
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:44,830
Amazon web services are
not as prone to crashing.

359
00:23:44,831 --> 00:23:45,664
And being destroyed.

360
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:50,930
Then it would be the the muse development
testing components for those people

361
00:23:50,931 --> 00:23:51,950
who don't know the term use,

362
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:57,100
referring to a cash flow
optimized business that can
scale effectively without

363
00:24:00,891 --> 00:24:04,580
scaling and headcount,
uh, or hours necessarily.

364
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:10,040
And the other elements of
delegation and automation,

365
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,180
those,
those,

366
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:16,070
those I think from a tactic standpoint
are the most outdated and therefore what

367
00:24:16,071 --> 00:24:17,420
I'm asked most frequently for,

368
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:18,603
right.

369
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:23,590
So if people were to listen to the
podcast and read the book or read the book

370
00:24:23,591 --> 00:24:28,150
and then listen to the podcast as one
would hope after 10 years there's been,

371
00:24:28,151 --> 00:24:31,270
as you've been talking about a
shift in mindset and personality.

372
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:35,920
If you were to rewrite it, would there
be a section that you would add to that?

373
00:24:35,921 --> 00:24:39,820
Obviously so much about
mindset and mental approach,

374
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,620
stoicism sign that has
come into your life.

375
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:46,860
Would there be an element that you would
add that maybe 29 year old Tim 20 year

376
00:24:47,921 --> 00:24:52,570
old Tim never even realize the importance
that it played in terms of either

377
00:24:52,571 --> 00:24:57,571
growing a business or having a mindset
that would allow you to not only sustain,

378
00:24:58,211 --> 00:25:01,270
say success,
but happiness with that success.

379
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:07,470
I would expand a section that
I think gets overlooked a lot.

380
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:13,130
There is a section or a chapter called
filling the void and it's a really,

381
00:25:13,831 --> 00:25:17,430
really, really important chapter that
most people don't pay much attention to.

382
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:22,140
And it answers the question,

383
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:27,410
what should I do once I have created a
self sustaining semi or fully automated

384
00:25:28,921 --> 00:25:33,921
business that funds all of my cashflow
requirements and I have location

385
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:40,350
independence and flexibility with time,
uh,

386
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:44,400
w hence the chapter title,

387
00:25:44,401 --> 00:25:45,690
which is filling the void,

388
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:50,640
how to reallocate your time and
direct your focus once you've

389
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:55,450
gained a few rungs on Maslow's
hierarchy of needs. Right? So you're,

390
00:25:55,451 --> 00:25:59,790
you're paying your rent, you're covering
all your, uh, all of your material needs.

391
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:00,653
Then what,

392
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:05,870
and this relates to a common
misconception of the four hour work week,

393
00:26:08,971 --> 00:26:10,020
which is,
oh,

394
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:15,410
the objective is to just sit on
a beach sipping a Pina Colada,

395
00:26:15,451 --> 00:26:18,840
rubbing cocoa butter on your stomach for
the rest of your life. Wait, wait, wait.

396
00:26:18,841 --> 00:26:23,290
That wasn't the point. Or
somehow being idle, right? The,

397
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:26,130
the objective is to whatever,
just live spring break,

398
00:26:26,131 --> 00:26:27,510
24 seven for the rest of your life.

399
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:32,930
And the people who lodge that
complaint a haven't read the book,

400
00:26:34,111 --> 00:26:35,070
but they,
they,

401
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:39,450
they very specifically have missed
this filling the void chapter,

402
00:26:39,451 --> 00:26:44,451
which talks about contribution
getting outside of a me,

403
00:26:44,731 --> 00:26:45,810
me,
me focus.

404
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:51,080
So that you are hopefully putting a
positive dent in the world in a way that

405
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:56,190
certainly extends outside of yourself
and even your immediate family,

406
00:26:56,191 --> 00:27:01,191
but also hopefully has some type of
persistence over time so that you leave a

407
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:05,010
hesitate to use the word because
it's so loaded and has some baggage,

408
00:27:05,011 --> 00:27:07,940
but a legacy of some type a.

409
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:12,360
And so that really you're taking the
tools you've developed in a business

410
00:27:12,361 --> 00:27:15,630
capacity and applying them
to impact in some fashion,

411
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,440
whether that's focused on education,
scientific research,

412
00:27:19,441 --> 00:27:22,260
where I'm spending a lot of time actually
focused on both of those and have been

413
00:27:22,261 --> 00:27:24,210
for a very long time. Uh, I,

414
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:29,520
I think I would expand that and make it
clear that that is mandatory reading.

415
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:34,980
It's not a nice to have when
you have an extra few hours,

416
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,080
five years from now, you should
read this. It's like, no,

417
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:42,300
I expect that many
people skipped it because

418
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:48,290
maybe they don't expect to succeed.
Right, right. They're like, Hey,

419
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:51,350
I'll cross that bridge when I get to it.
I don't have to even think about it now.

420
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:56,540
And the fact of the matter is, you
know, thousands, tens of thousands,

421
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:59,660
hundreds of thousands of
people have created these
businesses and then they fuck

422
00:27:59,661 --> 00:28:03,350
up that part. Right. And they
get, even in some cases they get,

423
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:07,520
and this is really common there.
Location Independent.

424
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:09,440
A lot of their friends
have nine to five jobs.

425
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:13,220
And what started off as a party
and a celebration. Oh my God,

426
00:28:13,221 --> 00:28:15,590
I can't believe I figured it out.
Ends up being very,

427
00:28:15,591 --> 00:28:20,420
very lonely and they feel really isolated
and they don't know how to address

428
00:28:20,421 --> 00:28:21,230
that.

429
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:25,820
And the way you dress that is by
digging your wells before you're dry and

430
00:28:25,821 --> 00:28:26,631
thinking about that,

431
00:28:26,631 --> 00:28:31,631
filling the void and starting
to incorporate those pieces
into your life before

432
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:37,100
you end up in a maybe a, a,

433
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:42,700
a challenging emotional psychological
position where you're on your heels a bit,

434
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:45,850
you end up being reactive or uh,

435
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:51,260
so set in your ways.
Even if you are,

436
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,890
even if you are technically
financially independent,

437
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:58,190
since you haven't filled the void
with anything non business related,

438
00:28:58,191 --> 00:29:02,240
you were just going to continue to work
for work sick. This is really common.

439
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:07,130
This is the default, right? For
people who succeed in any capacity,

440
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:12,160
to the extent that they no longer need
additional income or cashflow OER or

441
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,100
liquid net worth, it's,
it's really common.

442
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:19,820
It's very rare that you find someone
who's been in sixth gear for a very long

443
00:29:19,821 --> 00:29:22,840
time who then retires and is really
good at chilling the fuck out, right?

444
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:28,180
Not Common learning to relax and enjoy.

445
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:33,080
Other aspects of life and
engage with people around you,

446
00:29:33,081 --> 00:29:35,330
friends and community or build community.

447
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:38,480
Those are skills that you
have to practice and develop.

448
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:40,970
Just like you need to
develop and practice the,

449
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:44,410
of split testing for
headlines or anything else.

450
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:49,390
It's not a default ability that you have
as soon as you hit stop and so called

451
00:29:49,391 --> 00:29:53,200
retire or do something like that. Uh, so
I, I would spend a bit more time on that.

452
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:58,870
I think that is the chapter that I'm,
I was qualified right at the time,

453
00:29:58,871 --> 00:30:03,871
but I'm much more qualified to right now
because I've had so much more practice

454
00:30:04,091 --> 00:30:07,540
I've just had put on a lot more mileage
and done a lot more experimentation and

455
00:30:07,541 --> 00:30:12,541
have had the ability to observe dozens
and hundreds at this point of mega

456
00:30:12,851 --> 00:30:15,880
successful people who have
grappled with some of these,

457
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:19,450
these issues that can be
really existential for someone.

458
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:23,500
If the business has been your identity
for a long time and all of a sudden you

459
00:30:23,501 --> 00:30:27,370
want to replace that. If you don't
have a compelling replacement,

460
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,460
you will just continue working because
you don't want to sacrifice that identity.

461
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:36,480
And how, how can someone possibly
prepare for that? Because I think what,

462
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:38,100
and you can correct me if I'm wrong,

463
00:30:38,101 --> 00:30:43,101
is probably been amazing for you to see
is the number of businesses and success

464
00:30:45,061 --> 00:30:48,130
stories that have born out
of four hour work week.

465
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:50,850
You obviously expected that when you
wrote it, it would be able to help people.

466
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:52,441
But over 10 years,

467
00:30:52,441 --> 00:30:56,340
the number of huge businesses that
have been started out of thin air,

468
00:30:56,341 --> 00:30:58,950
it's not even like you were accelerating.
People quit their job,

469
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,170
started this and it had
it built out of nowhere.

470
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:02,940
How do you take someone who's just like,

471
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:08,040
maybe maybe this could work and then
they do it and the next thing they know

472
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:12,090
they do it because they want to believe,

473
00:31:12,091 --> 00:31:14,820
but they probably don't believe in
the first place. But as you said,

474
00:31:14,821 --> 00:31:16,680
if you don't have that preparation,

475
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:20,570
you might wake up one day and find
yourself in a position that you're,

476
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:24,030
you're not prepared for. So when, when
someone comes into this with the mindset,

477
00:31:24,031 --> 00:31:26,250
I want to give this a try.
It's like when people want to lose weight,

478
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:28,830
everyone wants to lose weight.
Everyone wants to make more money,

479
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,320
but very few people actually
believe and then they,

480
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:35,060
they follow the steps and they get there
and they're like, oh, what now? Yeah.

481
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:40,400
How do you build a mindset that is
prepared for reality that a part of you

482
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:42,660
probably doesn't even think is real?

483
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:44,730
I would say in the beginning,

484
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:50,490
aside from making sure you're exercising
and taking care of the highest value

485
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:51,900
asset you have,
uh,

486
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:56,040
you're going to need to
throw a lot against the wall
with the business to figure

487
00:31:56,041 --> 00:32:00,120
out what works. You can't
do an 80, 20 analysis if you
don't have anything to add,

488
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,930
to analyze, right? So you're going to
have to try many, many, many, many,

489
00:32:03,931 --> 00:32:07,470
many things to figure out what you're
good at, what you're enthusiastic about.

490
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:13,050
And uh, to succeed and endure
are respectively, you need both.

491
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,550
You have to have endurance and
you have to have ability and,

492
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:19,230
and that can be God given talent or
it can be skill that you developed.

493
00:32:19,231 --> 00:32:22,980
But in all of those cases,
you need to throw a lot against the wall.

494
00:32:22,981 --> 00:32:27,981
So in the beginning there isn't going
to be much diversification of identity.

495
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,010
You're going to have to really
throw a lot against the wall.

496
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:34,920
That's the front loading period.
Then you can start to do 80,

497
00:32:34,921 --> 00:32:35,940
20 analysis and so on.

498
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:40,880
I would say once the business has enough
traction that you've proven what the

499
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:45,910
tech world would call product market fit
and you believe you might have a tiger

500
00:32:46,671 --> 00:32:50,210
by the tail that you can
grow in a meaningful way.

501
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:54,830
Once you have that,
there are a few steps you can take.

502
00:32:54,831 --> 00:32:57,440
Number one is to

503
00:32:58,630 --> 00:32:59,200
okay

504
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:04,200
build a business that you can sell
even if you never plan on selling it.

505
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:10,990
This is a very helpful,
not just thought exercise but blueprint

506
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:15,680
to keep in mind and lens through which
you should look at your business.

507
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:19,970
And there are, there are other books out
there that I think can be quite helpful.

508
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:22,340
Uh,
the e myth revisited is one

509
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:27,620
looks mostly it's service businesses
but could be applied to product built to

510
00:33:27,621 --> 00:33:32,600
sell by John Warrillow is a book that
I found very interesting to ponder and

511
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,880
when you start to

512
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:40,820
look at your business as something as
another product that you are going to

513
00:33:40,821 --> 00:33:44,420
ultimately sell,
you remove single points of failure,

514
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,840
key man or key women risk.

515
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:53,350
You begin to really emphasize process
instead of just results which you can get.

516
00:33:54,441 --> 00:33:59,030
I mean if you're a type a super driven
person with some ability and some

517
00:33:59,031 --> 00:34:01,100
numeracy so you can analyze things,

518
00:34:01,101 --> 00:34:04,250
well you can white knuckle your
way to a fair amount of money,

519
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:09,670
but you might be rewarding really
unsustainable bad process because you're

520
00:34:09,711 --> 00:34:14,030
getting good results and not
only does that not scale,

521
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:14,871
it's unsustainable.

522
00:34:14,871 --> 00:34:19,550
You will burn out or most people will
certainly or you'll be miserable and you

523
00:34:19,551 --> 00:34:23,300
most certainly can't sell it unless
you want to be attached to it forever.

524
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:25,010
And

525
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:30,240
I would view that as lens slash.

526
00:34:30,241 --> 00:34:35,241
Step number one is once you have some
traction and you believe that you can pour

527
00:34:35,491 --> 00:34:39,450
gasoline on something that
is already working, okay,

528
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:43,590
now let's take step back.
Look at your org chart.

529
00:34:43,591 --> 00:34:46,350
You don't need a lot of headcount.
It's could still be a one person business,

530
00:34:46,351 --> 00:34:49,020
but how can I automate certain things?
How can I empower,

531
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:54,410
say freelancers or a fulfillment centers,

532
00:34:54,541 --> 00:34:59,541
companies I work with to make autonomous
decisions and otherwise create recipes

533
00:35:02,341 --> 00:35:07,341
and policies that replace me as a
bottleneck that needs to make one off

534
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:12,120
decisions over and over and over again.
That's really important.

535
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:15,690
The second would be simultaneously
or shortly thereafter,

536
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:19,710
diversifying your identity. You asked
about happy and it's a bit earlier,

537
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:24,810
let's just call it sense of wellbeing,
sense of inner peace,

538
00:35:24,811 --> 00:35:29,670
just feeling unconflicted,
uh, and unanxious.

539
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:30,533
Perhaps.

540
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,850
What I found very effective for
that is diversifying your identity.

541
00:35:35,851 --> 00:35:37,920
What does that mean?
If the thing you do,

542
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:40,710
and having lived in silicon
valley for 17 years, you know,

543
00:35:40,711 --> 00:35:44,730
recently moved to Austin, but having
lived in silicon valley for so long,

544
00:35:44,731 --> 00:35:48,990
you see people who in some cases
by necessity, unfortunately in, uh,

545
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:54,330
in sometimes a zero sum game of
venture back startups, they're only,

546
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:57,240
they're only identity is their startup.

547
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:00,300
And if the startup has a good day,

548
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,520
they have a good day and they
feel good about themselves.

549
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:05,280
If their startup has a bad day,
they have a bad,

550
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:07,860
they have a bad day and they
feel badly about themselves.

551
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:12,840
And there are factors outside of
your control when you run a business.

552
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:16,560
Clearly there are many factors within
your control, but there are many,

553
00:36:16,561 --> 00:36:21,270
many factors outside of your control,
macroeconomic climate, stock market,

554
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:25,110
the amount of disposable income
that your customers may have. A,

555
00:36:25,111 --> 00:36:27,690
if you're heavily weighted with,
say,

556
00:36:27,691 --> 00:36:32,190
a handful of distributors or clients
and they represent a large percentage of

557
00:36:32,191 --> 00:36:36,960
your sales or income,
also a palpable risk factor,

558
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:39,210
right? And who knows?
Like I, for instance,

559
00:36:39,211 --> 00:36:43,250
I had an experience when I was running
one of my first businesses and, uh,

560
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,820
the,
uh,

561
00:36:44,821 --> 00:36:49,650
one of my primary customers
had a key man risk. I,

562
00:36:49,651 --> 00:36:52,890
he a president who made a lot of
decisions. Yeah, he had a heart attack.

563
00:36:52,891 --> 00:36:54,030
You need an emergency surgery.

564
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:58,710
And the second command who was effectively
the default succession plans that hey,

565
00:36:58,711 --> 00:36:59,544
we need to like,

566
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:03,810
we need to stop a bunch of what we're
doing just to get back on our feet.

567
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,980
Just totally understandable,

568
00:37:04,981 --> 00:37:09,450
but it put my business
into a very reactive,

569
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:14,050
a precarious position. Right. All right,
so thinking through all these, but we're,

570
00:37:14,051 --> 00:37:14,561
we're,
we're,

571
00:37:14,561 --> 00:37:19,561
I'm going with that is if you are building
a muse or business is based on the

572
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:23,310
principles and strategies and so on, in
the four hour workweek, in some capacity,

573
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,920
you, I would encourage you to diversify
your identity, which means having,

574
00:37:28,921 --> 00:37:30,580
say a,

575
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:35,900
a consistent physical
practice that is goal based.

576
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:42,260
So when I was writing the four hour
body, I had a dead lifting protocol, uh,

577
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:47,270
among other things based on what sprint
coach Barry Ross and awful Po Pavel

578
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:48,301
Tsatsouline,

579
00:37:48,301 --> 00:37:52,830
which what they had taught me related
to developing maximal and relative

580
00:37:52,831 --> 00:37:57,060
strength and the deadlift. And if I
had a really tough week with my book,

581
00:37:57,061 --> 00:38:00,420
so authors do this too. They go into
this cave, which is book deadline.

582
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:03,300
And if they make progress on a book
in a week, they have a good week,

583
00:38:03,301 --> 00:38:05,250
they feel good.
If they do not make progress,

584
00:38:05,251 --> 00:38:10,251
they hit a roadblock or are
simply having difficulty writing.

585
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:15,660
It can, it can throw them existentially
into a really dark place. But all right.

586
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:20,760
Had a terrible day writing, but put
10 pounds on my dead lift. Good day.

587
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:22,381
All right.

588
00:38:22,381 --> 00:38:27,381
So you have now multiple silos in which
independent silos within which you can

589
00:38:29,011 --> 00:38:30,960
win.
And so you could have,

590
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:34,020
let's just say startup or book,

591
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:38,740
then you have something exercise-based
could be rock climbing, could be religion,

592
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:41,860
Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, Acroyoga. It
doesn't matter. Something consistent,

593
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:44,470
ideally with other people.
All right?

594
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:48,790
Not In your garage gym. Uh,
which I had at the time,

595
00:38:48,791 --> 00:38:51,640
but I chose to go to a rock climbing
gym where they also had weight training

596
00:38:51,641 --> 00:38:56,320
facilities to be around other people.
This is undervalued.

597
00:38:56,950 --> 00:39:01,750
And then the next piece could be
anything. It could be voice lessons,

598
00:39:01,751 --> 00:39:05,830
could be a musical instrument,
could be some type of artwork.

599
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:09,670
It doesn't matter. But these are
three independent silos or more.

600
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:14,260
I usually have two or three
so that if one of these fails,

601
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:16,300
it's self contained,
right?

602
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:21,330
Sort of like on any type of cruise ship
or a large seaborne vessel at this point

603
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:26,320
you will have compartments so that
if something terrible happens,

604
00:39:26,321 --> 00:39:28,540
it gets punctured by an iceberg,
something like that.

605
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:33,220
The whole ship doesn't go down. It
is a self contained, controllable,

606
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:35,200
uh, set of damage. Right?

607
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:38,380
I think that you can view your identity
very similarly and you want to set that

608
00:39:38,381 --> 00:39:41,070
up before you need it.
Do not wait until one of,

609
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:45,520
do not wait until your single silo fails
to then try to build the other two.

610
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:47,710
You have to preemptively put it in place.
Right?

611
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:50,810
So those are a few of the things that,

612
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:55,270
that I think about and have implemented
quite a bit for myself and that I've

613
00:39:55,271 --> 00:39:57,730
seen successfully
implemented by other people.

614
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:04,030
I would call you overall insatiable when
it comes to the things that you want to

615
00:40:05,721 --> 00:40:10,721
do and the goals that you want to achieve
and the speed and level of achievement

616
00:40:11,211 --> 00:40:12,790
that you want to achieve them in.

617
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,000
I imagine it was the same way
when you're writing this book,

618
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:22,610
but I also know that you
are much more reflective.

619
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:28,120
What would Tim Ferriss right now tell
the Tim Ferriss who is writing for our

620
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:34,790
work week? Knowing right now
the success the book has had,

621
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:39,720
how many people it is genuinely helped
and the, and the difference it's made, uh,

622
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:42,020
you know,
overall to so many people's lives.

623
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:47,350
I think there's going to be a very
dissatisfying answer that always works up.

624
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:53,000
I don't think I tell him anything until
the book was done because, and this is,

625
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:57,830
this is a dissatisfying answer that a
lot of my interviewees on the podcast get

626
00:40:57,831 --> 00:41:02,180
me and I'm always like, ah,
come on. But they're like, hey,

627
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:06,800
much like me with my hesitancy to go
back and edit the four hour work week.

628
00:41:06,801 --> 00:41:09,440
It's like, I don't want to step
on that one butterfly. That then

629
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:13,550
changes everything,
the entire trajectory.

630
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:19,280
And if you think about it in a given day,
I remember I was,

631
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:21,020
I was contemplating this at one point.

632
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:26,450
We think of life changing as big events.
X,

633
00:41:26,451 --> 00:41:30,350
Y and Z was life changing. X, Y and
Z changed my life. Some big event,

634
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:34,010
but almost decision,

635
00:41:34,011 --> 00:41:39,011
every act you take it every given
moment in a day is by definition life

636
00:41:40,221 --> 00:41:40,700
changing.

637
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:45,170
He choose to breathe in a certain way
or hold your breath or drink coffee

638
00:41:45,171 --> 00:41:49,550
instead of water. These are
all life changing events. Uh,

639
00:41:49,551 --> 00:41:53,390
if you were to look at two
parallel movies of your life,

640
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:59,210
choosing to take an Uber versus walking,
I mean, these can all change your life.

641
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:00,980
So I,
I don't

642
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,980
underestimate the impact
of seemingly small changes.

643
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:11,780
I wouldn't say anything to him until
he had finished the book. Even then,

644
00:42:11,781 --> 00:42:13,430
I might say nothing.

645
00:42:13,431 --> 00:42:18,431
But if I were to tell him anything
at maybe a few critical junctures,

646
00:42:18,531 --> 00:42:23,360
I'd say everything's going to be okay.
You can probably get what you need done,

647
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:29,500
but dial back the anxiety and worry at
least 20% I don't think Tim of 29 would

648
00:42:31,521 --> 00:42:35,570
have listened. I would
agree. But nonetheless,

649
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:39,140
maybe I would say something like that.
Uh,

650
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:44,170
what I would probably say
to Tim at multiple points
is something that came up in

651
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:49,250
tribe of mentors. My last
book repeatedly, which was

652
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:57,050
there've been multiple points where
I have felt like a failure or have

653
00:42:57,051 --> 00:43:02,051
experienced what from every vantage
point objectively looks like a business

654
00:43:02,151 --> 00:43:05,550
failure or publishing failure or
a huge mistake, gigantic fuck up.

655
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:11,290
And something that came up a lot in
interviews for the last book was sometimes

656
00:43:13,041 --> 00:43:16,760
you need life to save you from what
you want so you can get what you need.

657
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:20,540
And this is another reason
why I now ask so many people,

658
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:22,370
what is your favorite failure?

659
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:27,140
Meaning a failure that in retrospect set
you up for a much larger success later.

660
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:31,070
And I've really,

661
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:33,783
yeah.

662
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:34,990
Suffered.

663
00:43:36,370 --> 00:43:37,110
Okay.

664
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:42,110
From overly fixating on and worrying
about what seem like or seemed like

665
00:43:43,411 --> 00:43:47,940
failures as caused me
a lot of pain and uh,

666
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:53,580
both in the present moment and looking
back at it and wondering about the

667
00:43:53,581 --> 00:43:58,470
persistent effects of that
so called failure. Um, so
I, I think I would say, Hey,

668
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,500
I know this seems like a
catastrophe at the moment,

669
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:04,740
but this is actually going to

670
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:06,720
okay,

671
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:11,160
open a door that you can't even imagine
right now to greater opportunities.

672
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:15,180
And that might sound like some bullshit,
shallow motivational speaker nonsense.

673
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:18,240
Like in fact like, trust me,
I can't tell you what it is,

674
00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:22,860
but just like this is going to serve you.
And that's true.

675
00:44:22,861 --> 00:44:24,270
I mean if you look back at for instance,

676
00:44:24,271 --> 00:44:27,150
the very difficult experience which
was publishing the four hour chef,

677
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:29,640
and I won't go into
great detail about this,

678
00:44:29,641 --> 00:44:34,500
but does it incredibly difficult to write,
very proud of it, but almost killed me.

679
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:37,650
I mean physically it was one of the most
difficult books to write, put together.

680
00:44:37,651 --> 00:44:40,320
Very complex,
lots of moving pieces.

681
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:46,220
It was because it was published by Amazon
and was the first major acquisition by

682
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:51,330
what was then announced to be Amazon
publishing. It was boycotted by everybody,

683
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:55,350
Barnes and noble indies,
big box retailers.

684
00:44:55,351 --> 00:44:59,670
People wouldn't carry it. And uh, it was,

685
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:04,650
it was an extremely, extremely painful,
let's just say two to three years for me.

686
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:09,060
And I was burned out. I was
completely burned out. So I was,

687
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:14,090
I was really just depressed
and demoralized and felt
like hiding from the world

688
00:45:15,031 --> 00:45:17,190
during.
And after that experience,

689
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:22,530
I was so burned out that I decided to
take a break from writing and I decided to

690
00:45:22,531 --> 00:45:26,220
do something lighter because during
the promotion of the four hour chef,

691
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:28,710
even though the book didn't
perform the way I had wanted it to,

692
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:32,610
I had this experience with
the new format called podcast.

693
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:38,120
And I was interviewed by Mark Marin
and Joe Rogan and the Nerdist gang,

694
00:45:38,491 --> 00:45:39,570
including Chris Hardwick and I,

695
00:45:39,571 --> 00:45:43,980
I had so much fun during this podcast
and I could be myself and we could get

696
00:45:43,981 --> 00:45:47,610
into the weeds because it wasn't
two to three minutes on television.

697
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,570
I wondered to myself,
what if I tried that?

698
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:56,600
And just like those guys
edit very minimally and use
it as an opportunity to get

699
00:45:57,181 --> 00:46:01,410
better at asking questions to get rid
of some of my verbal ticks and use it as

700
00:46:01,411 --> 00:46:04,500
an excuse to talk to more interesting
people and record it and be more social

701
00:46:04,501 --> 00:46:07,380
because I'm prone to isolating myself.
Why not?

702
00:46:07,381 --> 00:46:09,720
Why don't I give that a shot
and try it for six episodes?

703
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:15,210
So if I hadn't had what I considered
a complete catastrophe at the time,

704
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:18,330
this podcast wouldn't even exist,

705
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:22,350
which has turned into something much,

706
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:26,130
arguably a much bigger than
all of my books combined,

707
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:31,620
at least based on feedback from listeners
and certainly based on monthly reach.

708
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:35,910
That's one of many, many examples.
So I think I would say, look,

709
00:46:35,911 --> 00:46:39,720
just trust me because I'm your future
use so I know more than you do actually

710
00:46:39,721 --> 00:46:42,240
kid. Uh, this seems like a mess,

711
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:46,440
but you need life to save you from what
you want sometimes to give you what you

712
00:46:46,441 --> 00:46:47,730
really need.
And Trust me,

713
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:53,040
this apparent failure is going
to give you like a hundred x.

714
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:54,510
On the flip side,

715
00:46:54,510 --> 00:46:57,720
just be fucking patient and don't do
anything stupid and self destructive cause

716
00:46:57,721 --> 00:47:00,570
you're really depressed and sad right now.
That's what I would say.

717
00:47:01,370 --> 00:47:06,030
And how important is that that the failure
can really happen at any point? Yeah,

718
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:07,700
I mean when you think
about four hour chef,

719
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:12,890
you had two number one bestsellers
at that point and four work week.

720
00:47:12,891 --> 00:47:16,430
I think it was on the bestseller list for
forever is a good way to put it. Yeah,

721
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:18,460
like foreign almost five years straight.
Yeah.

722
00:47:18,461 --> 00:47:23,461
It's so knowing that a lot of people
associate failure at the beginning when

723
00:47:24,261 --> 00:47:27,620
they start with the failure can happen
at any point and that resilience is

724
00:47:27,621 --> 00:47:29,200
important.
How much has that,

725
00:47:29,201 --> 00:47:32,400
almost even the lesson that needs
to be applied to four workweek,

726
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:37,090
if someone is picking it up or going
back or thinking about giving some of the

727
00:47:37,091 --> 00:47:41,920
recommendations to try. Um, I
think resiliency as you said,

728
00:47:41,921 --> 00:47:45,160
it's something that you've learned but
as it's something that you can prepare

729
00:47:45,161 --> 00:47:48,520
for as you tried to start something new,
which is scary for anyone.

730
00:47:49,850 --> 00:47:52,610
There are many ways to practice
it in many ways to train yourself.

731
00:47:54,110 --> 00:47:58,490
I won't beat a dead horse on
stoicism since I've certainly
talked a lot about it,

732
00:47:58,491 --> 00:48:02,540
but still philosophy, Seneca
Marcus realized have both
been very, very helpful.

733
00:48:02,930 --> 00:48:05,150
And for those people who have no
familiarity, I'm not going to get into it.

734
00:48:05,151 --> 00:48:07,090
But you can,
you can Google Tao of Seneca.

735
00:48:07,091 --> 00:48:12,091
I've put together gigantic compilation
that contained some of my favorite

736
00:48:12,561 --> 00:48:14,300
writing.
It's available for free as an ebook.

737
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:17,420
You can find it easily Tao Tao of Seneca,

738
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:21,980
but you know, everyone from
Bill Bellacheck, right?

739
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:26,330
Competitor supreme in the, uh, in
certainly in the football arena.

740
00:48:26,830 --> 00:48:29,720
I to George Washington,
Thomas Jefferson. I mean,

741
00:48:29,721 --> 00:48:34,680
you go through prisoners of
war from Vietnam War and,

742
00:48:34,681 --> 00:48:39,590
and other periods have all cited
it or in some fashion. Actually,

743
00:48:39,591 --> 00:48:41,300
Bill Belicheck hasn't personally cited,

744
00:48:41,301 --> 00:48:45,570
but I know that the Patriots Seahawks
and so on at every possible level, uh,

745
00:48:45,830 --> 00:48:49,760
have consumed stoicism as a
means of competitive advantage.

746
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:55,350
But in terms of developing resilience
and tempering emotional reactivity so you

747
00:48:58,731 --> 00:49:03,410
can make better decisions, that's a
fantastic tool. It's really a tool kit.

748
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:08,030
So that's one. Uh, in general
I would say on a daily basis.

749
00:49:08,031 --> 00:49:11,440
And this is especially true for
me in the last six months, uh,

750
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:12,950
actually with the help of Tony Robbins.

751
00:49:12,951 --> 00:49:16,880
So I've gotten to know over the last few
years and Tony's one of those people who

752
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:23,090
it's easy to be skeptical of
Tony. Uh, I've always been a fan.

753
00:49:23,091 --> 00:49:27,740
I mean my very first business was a
byproduct in part of listening to personal

754
00:49:27,741 --> 00:49:28,574
power too,

755
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:32,210
which I bought used at a used bookstore
and listened to in my crappy hand me

756
00:49:32,211 --> 00:49:35,990
down piece of Shit Green
Minivan, which my, uh,

757
00:49:36,050 --> 00:49:39,770
my coworkers affectionately nicknamed
the molester mobile. Thanks guys.

758
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:42,200
I'm not because I'm a molester,

759
00:49:42,201 --> 00:49:45,110
but because it was a fucking beat up
minivan that looked like something out of

760
00:49:45,111 --> 00:49:48,770
silence of the lambs and uh, got,
had the seats stolen out of the back,

761
00:49:48,771 --> 00:49:51,260
which didn't help matters
the long story anyway.

762
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:54,470
I would get stuck in traffic
on one oh one in the bay area,

763
00:49:54,471 --> 00:49:58,790
which anyone who's done it knows sucks
and listened to Tony robins back and

764
00:49:58,791 --> 00:50:01,910
forth. And then, so it's very largely
responsible for my first business.

765
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:05,090
In any case, I've gotten to know
Tony over the last few years.

766
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:07,780
I've attended two of his events, have
spent a lot of time with him in person,

767
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:10,970
had him on the podcast a
couple of times and he's,

768
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,090
he's more impressive the
better you get to know him.

769
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:19,720
And what would he really drove home
for me in the last few months is the

770
00:50:21,261 --> 00:50:26,261
importance of trying to identify your
primary question or primary questions that

771
00:50:27,501 --> 00:50:32,150
you ask yourself as a means
of dictating behavior.

772
00:50:32,151 --> 00:50:36,440
And it's very often something
subconscious. So it could be,

773
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:38,270
and this is very common for folks,
you know,

774
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:43,420
am I good enough or why am I not good
enough or what the fuck's wrong with me?

775
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:48,520
Like these are very common
default questions that
unsurprisingly then results in

776
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:53,570
many types of debilitating
thought patterns, neuroses,

777
00:50:54,710 --> 00:50:57,200
sabotaging behaviors in relationships,
whatever it might be,

778
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:01,730
and spending time and Tony's the right
guy to look to for direction on that.

779
00:51:01,731 --> 00:51:03,110
I'm not going to do it justice here,

780
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:08,560
but figuring out your default questions
and then crafting new to fall questions.

781
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:14,620
So my default question or
one of my default questions
now that I try to revisit

782
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:18,710
on a daily basis, because again,
you have to practice this stuff.

783
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:19,970
It's not like you just decide,

784
00:51:19,971 --> 00:51:22,490
write it on a piece of paper and then
your life is changed forever and your

785
00:51:22,491 --> 00:51:27,110
behaviors upgraded and definitely no,
you have to practice this stuff is,

786
00:51:27,130 --> 00:51:31,190
you know, how can I even more
so appreciate this as a gift,

787
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:36,440
right? And there's, there's,
there's, there's a bit more
nuance to it, but let's,

788
00:51:36,441 --> 00:51:38,150
let's take a simple version.
How can,

789
00:51:38,151 --> 00:51:43,151
I appreciate this as a gift
and specifically that is
to be used when you are

790
00:51:44,061 --> 00:51:46,070
frustrated,
when someone is challenging you,

791
00:51:46,071 --> 00:51:50,210
when you get an email or a phone call
you hate, that throws you into a tizzy.

792
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:56,020
When things happen that you would normally
look at as a problem or perhaps at

793
00:51:58,191 --> 00:52:01,580
best a challenge. Like how can
you view this as a gift? Oh,

794
00:52:01,610 --> 00:52:04,130
you're stuck in traffic. You're
going to miss your flight. Okay,

795
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,680
this is a chance to practice
cause guess what? You're missing.

796
00:52:06,681 --> 00:52:10,460
You're fucking flight no matter what.
So how can you view this as a gift?

797
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:15,080
Like what is this an opportunity to do?
Uh,

798
00:52:15,110 --> 00:52:20,110
that is another way to develop an ability
to reframe quickly that is incredibly

799
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:29,260
pragmatic and incredibly effective for
becoming less reactive and more able to

800
00:52:32,871 --> 00:52:37,040
be responsible in the
sense of response able,

801
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:41,660
you're choosing your response and
that perhaps more than anything else,

802
00:52:41,661 --> 00:52:45,380
if you want some semblance of
wellbeing or feeling of inner peace,

803
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:48,710
it is that it is not,
by the way,

804
00:52:48,711 --> 00:52:53,711
I mean if you look at a lot of the noise
and craziness right now in the media

805
00:52:53,841 --> 00:52:54,674
cycle,

806
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:59,240
there are many people who are training
themselves and encouraging other people

807
00:52:59,241 --> 00:53:01,400
to try to make everyone in the,

808
00:53:01,490 --> 00:53:06,490
in the world change their behavior to
make everyone other than themselves less

809
00:53:08,151 --> 00:53:12,740
offensive, right? This is the
opposite of making yourself resilient.

810
00:53:13,730 --> 00:53:14,780
It is much more,

811
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:20,530
much more practical and possible to train
yourself to be less easily offended,

812
00:53:23,510 --> 00:53:27,360
to train yourself to reframe
so that you can take people,

813
00:53:27,690 --> 00:53:32,690
many of which are never going to change
the behaviors and repurpose what they

814
00:53:33,961 --> 00:53:37,530
might present you with as
an opportunity or a gift.

815
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:40,080
This doesn't mean you don't
call out terrible behavior.

816
00:53:40,110 --> 00:53:43,080
It doesn't mean that at some points
you don't put on brass knuckles,

817
00:53:43,081 --> 00:53:45,840
metaphorically speaking and like
deck someone in the face. Yeah,

818
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:50,670
there are times when you fight,
but if your default is always fighting,

819
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:52,980
not a good approach,

820
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:58,890
you're not going to have the stamina
or the strength to actually fight the

821
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:01,790
larger necessary fights and uh,

822
00:54:01,930 --> 00:54:05,520
you're going to exhaust yourself and
you're going to alienate people. Uh,

823
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:08,100
I remember a very good friend,
actually, I won't mention him by name,

824
00:54:08,101 --> 00:54:12,840
but mutual friend of ours said to me
at one point who, who works with very,

825
00:54:12,841 --> 00:54:16,290
very high level players
in many different worlds.

826
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:20,100
He's a bit of a consigliere area and he
said to be over dinner once. He said,

827
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:21,361
cause I was,

828
00:54:21,361 --> 00:54:24,210
I was laying out all of these various
initiatives and causes and so on.

829
00:54:24,211 --> 00:54:26,640
I wanted to pursue in the new year.
This was a few years ago and he said,

830
00:54:27,090 --> 00:54:31,740
I think you should as a thought exercise,
just imagine that you have six bullets.

831
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:34,320
You have a revolver,
a six bullets,

832
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:37,650
and that's all you get to spend
over the next year or two.

833
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:42,930
You have six things you can take
really seriously and do very publicly.

834
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:45,720
That's it.
So pick those very wisely,

835
00:54:45,721 --> 00:54:49,560
which is not unlike Warren Buffett's
approach to saying, here's your,

836
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:52,800
here's your card.
You have 10 hole punches.

837
00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:56,760
Those are the investments you get to
make for the rest of your life just as a

838
00:54:56,761 --> 00:55:00,930
means of pumping the brakes and making
better decisions. I think that's a useful,

839
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:06,270
a useful way to think of things. So those
are a few, few things that come to mind.

840
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:12,600
I will not make you a do a request of
your audience or ask you what will go on

841
00:55:13,661 --> 00:55:14,470
your billboard,

842
00:55:14,470 --> 00:55:19,270
but I will ask you that if someone were
to go back and reread the four hour work

843
00:55:19,271 --> 00:55:22,570
week or if they were to pick it up
for the first time. As you mentioned,

844
00:55:23,350 --> 00:55:26,110
tons of people are still
discovering this book, which is a,

845
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:27,520
I think part of the beauty of it.

846
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:33,300
What would you tell them to keep in mind
as they're reading through it to really

847
00:55:33,311 --> 00:55:35,800
make it or allow it to have
the greatest impact on them?

848
00:55:36,910 --> 00:55:39,290
Uh,
I would say a few things.

849
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:43,760
Number one is that if the, the, the brash,

850
00:55:44,170 --> 00:55:48,950
uh, aggressive Tim Ferriss and it the shit
out of you at points, you're not alone.

851
00:55:49,610 --> 00:55:54,610
And try not to throw the
baby out with the bathwater.

852
00:55:55,850 --> 00:56:00,800
Meaning I am conveying in that
book principles, strategies,

853
00:56:00,830 --> 00:56:05,750
approaches that I have collected
from other places and other experts.

854
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,720
So if for whatever reason
the tone annoys you,

855
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:14,320
try as an exercise to absorb the message
without getting obsessed with the

856
00:56:16,911 --> 00:56:20,840
messenger, number one.
And for what it's worth,

857
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:25,060
that's not true for a very percentage
of people. But there's some folks,

858
00:56:25,690 --> 00:56:29,890
for whatever reason, uh, many
valid, I'm sure, uh, find,

859
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:30,760
find the tone,

860
00:56:31,210 --> 00:56:34,780
particularly in the first baby chapter
two to be a little off putting.

861
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:36,970
So just go into it,

862
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,750
maybe expecting that and ride it out a

863
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,380
second.
I would say that the,

864
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:49,360
the tools and practices like the fear
setting chapter and the fear setting,

865
00:56:49,361 --> 00:56:54,250
exercise, 80, 20 analysis, these
are not one and done practices.

866
00:56:54,910 --> 00:56:55,960
These are

867
00:56:57,550 --> 00:57:02,550
practices like having blood work done
every quarter or once a year that you

868
00:57:02,831 --> 00:57:07,480
repeat over time and that become
more and more valuable over time.

869
00:57:07,481 --> 00:57:11,590
The better you get at implementing them
and the better versed and more nuanced

870
00:57:11,591 --> 00:57:16,320
you become and using them.
Uh, that's what I would say.

871
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:19,950
Uh, those are two. And then last perhaps,

872
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:25,040
which relates to everything we've been
talking about is focus first and foremost

873
00:57:25,051 --> 00:57:26,190
on the,

874
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:32,360
the different reframing of
assumptions about life and principles,

875
00:57:35,790 --> 00:57:37,170
the core tenants of the book,

876
00:57:37,770 --> 00:57:42,770
the strategies and don't get overly
distracted by the tools and tactics.

877
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:50,310
So if you're not interested
in building your own business,

878
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:54,750
uh, or building a business along the
lines of what is described in the book,

879
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:57,960
that's fine.
Just focus on the higher level concepts.

880
00:57:58,290 --> 00:58:02,010
And this has been applied by
many, many, many people. I mean,

881
00:58:02,011 --> 00:58:06,090
if you look at some of the most successful
venture capitalists are billionaires

882
00:58:06,091 --> 00:58:10,710
who certainly do not have what they
would consider a four hour workweek. Uh,

883
00:58:10,770 --> 00:58:11,430
nonetheless,

884
00:58:11,430 --> 00:58:15,810
a lot of them have read this book and
been quoted in The New York Times and

885
00:58:15,811 --> 00:58:19,350
other other profiles that,
that, that are out there. Uh,

886
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:24,380
you have people working in say
education or defense contractors or uh,

887
00:58:27,030 --> 00:58:32,030
even attorneys who have read the book at
V and operate at a very high level who

888
00:58:33,451 --> 00:58:36,210
are applying the
principles in some fashion,

889
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:41,720
maybe just 10% and seeing a very dramatic
results but not building a business

890
00:58:43,191 --> 00:58:47,370
and don't get fixated on the,

891
00:58:49,490 --> 00:58:54,170
the type of pen that is being used or the
type of Kranz being used. Look at the,

892
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:58,490
look at the concepts of composition
and then the principles of drawing and

893
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:02,630
artwork and learn those because they are
transferable to many different areas.

894
00:59:03,950 --> 00:59:08,720
Awesome. Thank you, Tim. All right. Yeah,
my pleasure. Thanks for hanging out.

895
00:59:10,490 --> 00:59:13,850
Hey guys, this is Tim again. Just a
few more things before you take off.

896
00:59:14,210 --> 00:59:16,820
Number one,
this is five bullet Friday.

897
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:21,980
Do you want to get a short email from me?
Would you enjoy a short email from me

898
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:26,980
every Friday that provides a little more
soul of fun before the weekend and five

899
00:59:27,081 --> 00:59:31,610
bullet Friday is a very short email where
I share the coolest things I've found

900
00:59:31,611 --> 00:59:33,470
or that I've been pondering over the week.

901
00:59:33,710 --> 00:59:36,470
That could include favorite new
albums that I've discovered.

902
00:59:36,471 --> 00:59:39,920
It could include Gizmos and gadgets
and all sorts of weird shit that I've

903
00:59:39,921 --> 00:59:44,240
somehow dug up in the other
world of the esoteric as I do.

904
00:59:44,510 --> 00:59:49,510
It could include favorite articles that
I've read and that I've shared with my

905
00:59:50,181 --> 00:59:52,910
close friends for instance,
and it's very short.

906
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:57,950
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness
before you head off for the weekend.

907
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:00,200
So if you want to receive that,
check it out.

908
01:00:00,470 --> 01:00:03,750
Just go to four hour work
week.com that's four hour work,

909
01:00:03,751 --> 01:00:07,850
week.com all spelled out and just drop

910
01:00:07,851 --> 01:00:10,400
next one. And if you sign
up, I hope you enjoy it.

911
01:00:15,470 --> 01:00:17,750
This episode is brought to you by Peloton.

912
01:00:18,230 --> 01:00:20,870
And I'd heard about Peloton
over and over again,

913
01:00:20,930 --> 01:00:24,560
but I ended up getting a Peloton
bike and the whole system,

914
01:00:24,590 --> 01:00:28,940
after I saw my buddy Kevin Rose, I've
known of forever, some of you know,

915
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:34,000
and he showed up at my gate at my house
a while back and he looked fantastic.

916
01:00:36,410 --> 01:00:39,290
I asked him as a dude, you look great,
what the hell have you been up to?

917
01:00:39,291 --> 01:00:41,390
Because he's always doing
a weird diet or another,

918
01:00:41,391 --> 01:00:42,890
but it only lasts like a week or two.

919
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:46,760
So he always regresses to the mean
after like 75 beers and he said,

920
01:00:46,761 --> 01:00:49,310
I've been doing Peloton
five days a week now.

921
01:00:49,311 --> 01:00:54,020
That caught my attention because Kevin
does nothing five days a week and you

922
01:00:54,021 --> 01:00:57,260
know, I love you Kevin, but
it really peaked my curiosity.

923
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:02,320
Ended up getting a system and it's
become an integral part of my week.

924
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:07,220
I love it and I really didn't expect to
love it at all because I find cycling

925
01:01:07,221 --> 01:01:08,810
really boring usually.

926
01:01:08,930 --> 01:01:13,910
But peloton is an indoor cycling bike
that brings live studio classes right into

927
01:01:13,911 --> 01:01:14,744
your home.

928
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:17,240
You don't have to worry about fitting
classes into your schedule and making it

929
01:01:17,241 --> 01:01:19,340
to a studio with some type of commute,

930
01:01:19,341 --> 01:01:23,870
etc. New classes are added every day and
this includes options led by elite New

931
01:01:23,870 --> 01:01:25,280
York City instructors
in your own living room.

932
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:29,360
You can even livestream studio classes
taught by the world's best instructors or

933
01:01:29,361 --> 01:01:34,361
find your own favorite class on demand
and in fact Kevin and I rarely do live

934
01:01:34,551 --> 01:01:38,210
classes and you can compete with your
friends, which is also fun. Kevin,

935
01:01:38,211 --> 01:01:42,410
I'm coming after you but we
usually just use classes on demand.

936
01:01:42,470 --> 01:01:44,980
I really like Matt Wilbur's and his iron,

937
01:01:44,990 --> 01:01:49,990
high intensity training sessions that
are shorter like 20 minutes and I think

938
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:55,880
Kevin's favorite is Alex and everyone
seems to have their favorite instructor or

939
01:01:55,881 --> 01:01:58,160
you can select by music
duration and so on.

940
01:01:58,730 --> 01:02:03,710
Each Peloton bike includes a 22 inch HD
touchscreen performance tracking metrics.

941
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:08,030
I think that that along with the real
time leaderboard are the main reasons that

942
01:02:08,031 --> 01:02:12,680
this caught my attention when cycling
never had caught my attention before.

943
01:02:12,710 --> 01:02:16,220
It's really pretty stunning what they've
done with the user interface to keep

944
01:02:16,221 --> 01:02:20,520
your attention. The belt drive is
quiet and it's than you would expect.

945
01:02:20,521 --> 01:02:22,500
So it can fit in a
living room or an office.

946
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:27,530
I actually have it in a large closet
of belief or not and it fits with no

947
01:02:28,141 --> 01:02:31,590
problem.
So peloton is offering all of you guys,

948
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:33,510
listeners of the Tim Ferriss show,

949
01:02:33,511 --> 01:02:36,930
a special offer and it is
actually a special visit,

say man accessories, wait,

953
01:02:52,351 --> 01:02:56,970
I don't need fancy towels or whatever
other supplemental bits and pieces.

954
01:02:57,150 --> 01:02:59,190
No,
the shoes you need,

955
01:02:59,191 --> 01:03:02,220
you need the clip in shoes and
those are in the accessory category.

956
01:03:02,221 --> 01:03:05,760
So this a hundred dollars off
is a very legit, $100 off.

Tim,

965
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:44,340
this episode is brought to you
by we work. I love, we work.

966
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:48,090
I haven't had an office
in many, many, many, many,

967
01:03:48,091 --> 01:03:52,950
many years since 2000 or so
when I had my last real job,

968
01:03:53,060 --> 01:03:54,330
I suppose and quotation marks.

969
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:58,890
But when I moved from San Francisco
to Austin not long ago, I decided,

970
01:03:58,891 --> 01:04:01,540
you know what, I'm tired of
working at home. I'm tired of,

971
01:04:01,550 --> 01:04:02,670
we're going to coffee shops.

972
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:07,290
So one of the very first things I
did was to get a space at we work.

973
01:04:07,350 --> 01:04:12,210
I could not be happier with this change
of how we work is a global network of

974
01:04:12,211 --> 01:04:16,260
workspaces where companies and people
grow together. The idea is really simple.

975
01:04:16,650 --> 01:04:20,640
You focus on your business and we work
takes care of all the rest including

976
01:04:20,641 --> 01:04:24,300
front desk service until
Idis refreshments and more.

977
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:29,100
I also often have been shipped from
Amazon and elsewhere to my office that we

978
01:04:29,101 --> 01:04:30,420
work here in Austin.

979
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:34,710
I've been completely blown away
by the members only events,

980
01:04:34,711 --> 01:04:39,711
special offers and perhaps the best cold
brew coffee on tap that I've ever had.

981
01:04:40,410 --> 01:04:42,300
It's been amazing.
It's been a real,

982
01:04:42,330 --> 01:04:46,980
real change in my life and improved my
quality of life and there are also dog

983
01:04:46,981 --> 01:04:50,640
friendly. We work locations all
over the place. How Fun is that?

984
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:55,080
We work caters to everyone
from entrepreneurs and
freelancers to startups and

985
01:04:55,081 --> 01:04:59,550
even large enterprises including Ge,
salesforce, Microsoft, mastercard,

986
01:04:59,551 --> 01:05:04,110
Samsung, Spotify, Pinterest and red
bull among many others. In fact,

987
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:07,890
more than 10% of fortune
500 companies currently use.

988
01:05:07,891 --> 01:05:10,950
We work and it's a rapidly growing group.
In other words,

989
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:15,660
it's not just solar printers and to
ground level startups that use we work,

990
01:05:15,661 --> 01:05:20,661
but everything from that to the big
companies who are seeing it's a very huge

991
01:05:20,951 --> 01:05:22,150
benefits as well.

992
01:05:22,690 --> 01:05:25,810
We worked believes that create spaces
where people can connect with and create

993
01:05:25,811 --> 01:05:28,120
meaning together.
Right after all,

994
01:05:28,420 --> 01:05:32,330
if you are someone who has
built a business model on
the principles and the four

995
01:05:32,331 --> 01:05:34,720
hour workweek or elsewhere,
it can be a lonely road.

996
01:05:34,721 --> 01:05:37,380
Sometimes even though you're
digitally connected, it can feel very,

997
01:05:37,381 --> 01:05:38,320
very isolating.

998
01:05:38,770 --> 01:05:42,950
So in these spaces you can
connect with real humans and uh,

999
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:47,370
all the while you space more efficiently
and cost effectively, which makes it,

1000
01:05:47,371 --> 01:05:51,250
you end your business better equipped
to face the challenges of today and

1001
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:52,113
tomorrow.

1002
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:57,120
We work now has more than 200 locations
so you can find great spots all over the

1003
01:05:57,251 --> 01:05:57,790
world.

1004
01:05:57,790 --> 01:06:02,790
So head over to [inaudible] dot co
slash Tim that's [inaudible] dot co CEO

1005
01:06:03,970 --> 01:06:07,900
we.co/tim to become a part of
