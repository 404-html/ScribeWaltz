1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,310
So this is going to be a live recording,
well,

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:05,250
not alive,
a recording of our podcast before a live

3
00:00:05,251 --> 00:00:07,380
audience.
These are the interns,

4
00:00:07,381 --> 00:00:09,870
right,
of the American Enterprise Institute.

5
00:00:09,871 --> 00:00:13,380
Senior staff.
We didn't actually invite them,

6
00:00:13,381 --> 00:00:16,350
but they heard you were here and in 
their way,

7
00:00:16,351 --> 00:00:17,131
they just,
all,

8
00:00:17,131 --> 00:00:20,120
we ended up in this room.
We were going to be at our dark studio.

9
00:00:20,121 --> 00:00:20,230
Yeah,

10
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:20,521
no.
Well,

11
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:21,610
this is nice.
It's good to have.

12
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,070
It's nice to be in front of all your 
people.

13
00:00:24,071 --> 00:00:26,350
So hypothetically,
we'll see how civilized.

14
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:27,213
Sure.
Yes.

15
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,980
Is Antifa here?
No aunties.

16
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,710
No,
it's good.

17
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:32,560
Good.
All right.

18
00:00:32,561 --> 00:00:33,241
So we ready?
Yeah,

19
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:35,230
it's really nice to see you.
So nice to see you.

20
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,753
Okay.
Start.

21
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,750
Go.
Welcome to the FAM.

22
00:00:38,751 --> 00:00:39,584
Xplaners I'm Danielle crittendon and I'm
Christina Hoff summers and we are 

23
00:00:42,821 --> 00:00:47,821
thrilled to have the father of all 
mansplainers in our studio today.

24
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:50,823
You know,
I think he's actually more of a man 

25
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:53,890
whisperer.
Yes,

26
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:59,020
a man whisperer and the mad genius 
behind the intellectual dark web,

27
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:00,123
whatever.
Welcome to the FIMS planers Jordan 

28
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,400
Peterson.
Thank you very much.

29
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,673
So delighted to have you.
And it's an honor to have you honor and 

30
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:09,843
a note to our listeners.
We're recording this in front of a live 

31
00:01:12,071 --> 00:01:12,904
audience at the American Enterprise 
Institute in Washington DC where 

32
00:01:16,751 --> 00:01:21,340
Christina is a resident scholar and 
there'll be video of the podcast as well

33
00:01:21,341 --> 00:01:24,040
and we will let you know where to find 
that when it's ready.

34
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:28,960
And we're also grateful to Aei every 
week for the use of its recording studio

35
00:01:28,961 --> 00:01:29,794
for the podcast.
And now for an introduction though he 

36
00:01:33,161 --> 00:01:34,870
needs no introduction to the people 
here,

37
00:01:34,871 --> 00:01:35,704
but Jordan Peterson is a professor at 
the University of Toronto and author of 

38
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:40,474
many books and and poster of many 
fantastic lecturers and his most recent 

39
00:01:45,761 --> 00:01:48,910
book has,
I can't keep track of how many languages

40
00:01:48,911 --> 00:01:49,744
it's been translated into and the sales.
Just a phenomenally successful book 

41
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,630
tour.
In fact,

42
00:01:55,631 --> 00:01:58,030
my first question is really about your 
tour.

43
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,553
You look pretty good for somebody who's 
visited what a hundred cities in the 

44
00:02:03,371 --> 00:02:07,060
past years,
January 23rd I don't know how you do it,

45
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:12,130
and mostly flying.
What do you do for fun?

46
00:02:12,131 --> 00:02:15,370
What do you ever get to relax?
Even brief moments.

47
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:19,300
And what do you do?
Go on twitter and,

48
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,700
Oh God,
yes.

49
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,730
Although I've been qualified that is 
relaxing.

50
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,023
Um,
I tried to forestall that temptation as 

51
00:02:25,911 --> 00:02:27,410
much as possible.
Well,

52
00:02:27,411 --> 00:02:30,020
I have the auto mode bit of time that I 
can spend with my wife.

53
00:02:30,021 --> 00:02:32,060
She does travel with me.
And so,

54
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:32,930
you know,
we've had,

55
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:33,843
we,
we tried to take some time to walk 

56
00:02:35,181 --> 00:02:37,350
around the cities that we're in,
um,

57
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:41,480
and see what we can,
we're usually not at any given place for

58
00:02:41,481 --> 00:02:42,314
more than a day or two.
And they're usually pretty packed up 

59
00:02:44,061 --> 00:02:45,110
with,
well,

60
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:46,183
whatever is associated with the lecture.
And then with press that the publishers 

61
00:02:50,151 --> 00:02:50,984
usually arrange.

62
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:56,040
Well I heard you interviewed in Sweden,
you were in Stockholm and you were,

63
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,553
had a,
had a half an hour to visit the city 

64
00:02:58,651 --> 00:02:59,560
with your wife.
Yeah.

65
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:01,440
And you loved it.
But that,

66
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,473
you know,
it's very tricky breaks where you get 

67
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:05,511
them.
Well,

68
00:03:05,511 --> 00:03:06,344
the thing is is that the,
the lecture to her is unbelievably 

69
00:03:08,961 --> 00:03:09,940
positive.
Yes.

70
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,430
And a lot of this has is ridiculously 
positive.

71
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:13,881
You know,
like,

72
00:03:13,881 --> 00:03:18,260
so if I'm going out on the streets now 
or in cafes or you know,

73
00:03:18,261 --> 00:03:19,094
airports,
I meet people all the time and they're 

74
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:26,830
always polite and they're always happy 
to see me and they always have some very

75
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:27,914
touching story to relate and,
and then the audiences themselves are 

76
00:03:32,631 --> 00:03:37,280
very positively predisposed to whatever 
it is that we're doing together.

77
00:03:37,281 --> 00:03:42,281
And so that makes it a lot easier to 
stay motivated and to continue.

78
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,203
You know,
I mean it's demanding because 

79
00:03:47,841 --> 00:03:48,674
everything's scheduled so tightly and,
and I do a different lecture every 

80
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:54,500
night,
every,

81
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,333
every time I go.

82
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,233
I find that amazing because I give a lot
of lectures that I anguish over 

83
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:01,124
everywhere.
And then I have another one and it I it 

84
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:05,090
you go up without notes.

85
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:07,130
Yeah.
Well I have a large collection of,

86
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,020
you know,
things that I know what,

87
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:09,973
how to talk about.
And usually what I try to do is to 

88
00:04:11,691 --> 00:04:16,691
formulate a problem before the lecture.
So I'm addressing a specific problem and

89
00:04:17,661 --> 00:04:21,980
then I can track how I would set up the 
argument and then I walked through it.

90
00:04:21,981 --> 00:04:25,670
But part of it's also an attempt to 
formulate the argument on the fly,

91
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,181
you know,
to,

92
00:04:26,181 --> 00:04:27,014
to make the question,
what would you say to formulate it more 

93
00:04:29,271 --> 00:04:32,090
precisely and to make a more precise and
engaging answer.

94
00:04:32,091 --> 00:04:34,670
And then I can use the audience to judge
whether or not that's,

95
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:35,923
that's happening.
And so it's also a real challenge to do 

96
00:04:39,231 --> 00:04:40,064
that.
So I enjoyed that and it's an excellent 

97
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:44,413
intellectual workout and I've been 
recording the lectures and I'd been 

98
00:04:48,111 --> 00:04:48,944
using fair some of them to write the 
first draft of the chapters for my next 

99
00:04:54,081 --> 00:04:56,030
book and for books after that.
And so,

100
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:57,000
you know,
I'm,

101
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,833
I'm able to maximize the,
what would you say the utility of doing 

102
00:05:00,741 --> 00:05:02,280
this at each event.
And,

103
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,770
and my wife seems to be particularly 
well suited to traveling like that.

104
00:05:06,771 --> 00:05:11,771
She actually enjoys it quite a bit and,
and is very stable person.

105
00:05:12,781 --> 00:05:13,990
And so,
um,

106
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:15,410
that's also helpful.
So,

107
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:16,910
uh,
and you know,

108
00:05:16,911 --> 00:05:17,744
it's nice to have an extra brain along 
because things are scheduled so tightly 

109
00:05:20,961 --> 00:05:22,850
that we don't ever have any room for 
error.

110
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,710
Well we're going to,
I can't,

111
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,023
I don't know how intellectually rigorous
we plan to be with you today because we 

112
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,550
know that when you ever year on one of 
these platform,

113
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:37,000
you're talking about your ideas,
but on the fence planners,

114
00:05:37,001 --> 00:05:39,880
we want to hear more,
a little bit more about Jordan Peterson,

115
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:44,620
the man desk desperately and definitely 
want to hear about your wife Tammy.

116
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:50,220
And also you're so well known for your 
views on men or how your ideas have been

117
00:05:52,241 --> 00:05:54,580
taken up.
So enthusiastic or by young men.

118
00:05:54,581 --> 00:05:57,260
But we want to talk to you about women.
Yep.

119
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,280
That's good.
So,

120
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,143
but what is it,
one of the things you and I share is 

121
00:06:02,091 --> 00:06:04,360
that we both grew up in Canada.
Um,

122
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:05,683
I promise Christine,
I would not do my Canadian accent while 

123
00:06:08,121 --> 00:06:09,530
you were here.
Um,

124
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,950
but you grew up in rural Alberta.
I grew up in Toronto.

125
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,510
Um,
and you are what?

126
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:20,630
The country's most famous grew now since
Marshall Mcluhan.

127
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,910
Um,
and uh,

128
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:27,940
but it's the fact that you came from 
Canada have any effect on your views,

129
00:06:28,401 --> 00:06:30,440
do you think,
has it formed you in any way?

130
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,760
I mean,
what did,

131
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:32,700
what would it,
would,

132
00:06:32,701 --> 00:06:35,420
would it be the same if you think you'd 
grown up in rural Texas?

133
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,000
How was Canada contributed to your 
worldview?

134
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,820
She's always looking to,
for the Canadian angle?

135
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,073
Well,
I think the particular part of Canada I 

136
00:06:48,231 --> 00:06:52,130
grew up in probably was formative to 
some degree.

137
00:06:52,131 --> 00:06:52,964
I mean,
the town I grew up in was only 50 years 

138
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:56,090
old,
you know,

139
00:06:56,091 --> 00:06:56,924
and,
and the particular part of the world 

140
00:06:58,581 --> 00:06:59,414
that I grew up in was really the last 
settled part of the North American 

141
00:07:02,961 --> 00:07:04,640
prairie.
This was outside of Edmonton,

142
00:07:04,641 --> 00:07:05,070
correct?
Yeah,

143
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:07,370
about 400 miles north of Edmonton.
Oh,

144
00:07:07,371 --> 00:07:08,550
400 miles.
Yeah.

145
00:07:08,551 --> 00:07:10,130
Yeah.
It's right at the tip of the shorts.

146
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:15,170
So the prairie,
the prairie stretches up that far north.

147
00:07:15,171 --> 00:07:16,004
It's stretches up farther north in 
Alberta than it does anywhere else in 

148
00:07:18,261 --> 00:07:19,094
the North American continent.
And so we were at the tip of viable 

149
00:07:21,981 --> 00:07:24,800
farming essentially.
And so it was,

150
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:25,783
um,
it was a new place and it was a rather 

151
00:07:28,131 --> 00:07:30,020
raw place.
And it was,

152
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:32,290
it was a rather harsh place in many 
ways,

153
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:36,290
especially because of the winter.
And it was fundamentally a working class

154
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:37,124
place,
although a prosperous working class 

155
00:07:38,481 --> 00:07:39,051
place,
right.

156
00:07:39,051 --> 00:07:43,160
Because most of the industry there was 
related to the oil and gas industry on,

157
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:44,540
on.
Although it was cyclical,

158
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:49,541
when things were good working class 
people could make a very good living.

159
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,940
This is during the 70s.
So through the goal.

160
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:52,853
Yeah,
that's right.

161
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:57,910
To be a kid in 400 miles outside a small
town,

162
00:07:57,911 --> 00:07:58,744
but

163
00:07:59,050 --> 00:07:59,883
liked it when I was a kid,
I wouldn't say it was as fun when I was 

164
00:08:03,171 --> 00:08:04,860
a teenager.
Um,

165
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,670
but I'm not convinced that,
you know,

166
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:12,410
the majority of people who are teenagers
necessarily have the most wonderful time

167
00:08:12,411 --> 00:08:13,450
of it.
Um,

168
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:18,380
I think adults often look backwards at 
the pass through rose colored glasses.

169
00:08:18,381 --> 00:08:19,214
I think that's what the cartoon is 
Trudeau accused Reagan of doing 

170
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:23,990
continually.
Um,

171
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:25,510
Gary Trudeau,

172
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:29,120
the American Enterprise Institute tone.
Mister man.

173
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:29,981
No,
no man,

174
00:08:29,981 --> 00:08:34,390
I'm getting input used for it.
In your book was teenage wasteland,

175
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,580
what you call it?
Yeah,

176
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,990
but it's Canadianness does,
do you,

177
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,070
how does that formed you or affected 
you,

178
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,210
if at all?
Maybe it did.

179
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,920
It's hard to say.
I mean I've,

180
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:51,020
I've lived in lots of different parts of
Canada and Canada is quite different.

181
00:08:51,021 --> 00:08:55,860
I lived in Alberta for a while and it 
had this particular flavor of existence.

182
00:08:55,861 --> 00:08:57,400
I mean,
mostly in fairview.

183
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:02,420
I was striving to leave and to move 
ahead,

184
00:09:02,491 --> 00:09:03,840
let's say,
or to move,

185
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:08,320
I hesitate to say up at somewhere 
different somewhere more urban.

186
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:09,363
But that's the case with many people.
I mean the small towns all across the 

187
00:09:11,531 --> 00:09:12,364
West in the u s and Canada are dying.
They're down to nothing because 

188
00:09:17,171 --> 00:09:20,440
everyone's moved to the cities.
I lived in Montreal for a good while and

189
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,540
that was interesting because it was a 
very,

190
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,230
very different culture.
Um,

191
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:28,990
it was a culture that was to some degree
stratified by language and by class.

192
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,153
None of that was true in Alberta because
it was so new that there's no class 

193
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:32,981
structure.
Right.

194
00:09:32,981 --> 00:09:34,050
So that was quite interesting.

195
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,130
Right.
And you worked,

196
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:36,460
um,
what I loved,

197
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,890
I pulled a passage because I think as 
you say,

198
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,700
people are born in small places 
everywhere and someone to leave and some

199
00:09:42,701 --> 00:09:45,520
don't.
You said I want it to be elsewhere.

200
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,503
I wasn't the only one.
Everyone who eventually left the 

201
00:09:48,641 --> 00:09:51,490
fairview I grew up knew they were 
leaving by the age of 12.

202
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,713
I knew.
And my wife who grew up with me on the 

203
00:09:54,491 --> 00:09:58,690
same street knew what was that thing,
what would you call that?

204
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,640
What's the thing that makes you want to 
leave and,

205
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:05,500
and set you off because you point out 
there was no class system education with

206
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:09,250
cheap in Canada compared to states.
It wasn't cost,

207
00:10:09,251 --> 00:10:11,290
it was stopping people.
You were from a what?

208
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:12,850
Middleclass or you worked in other 
words,

209
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:15,840
teacher and Mario and my mother was a 
librarian though.

210
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,330
She had trained as a nurse.
So you know,

211
00:10:17,331 --> 00:10:18,164
we had a comfortable,
I would say a suburban lifestyle 

212
00:10:21,561 --> 00:10:22,990
essentially,
you know,

213
00:10:22,991 --> 00:10:24,020
um,
moderate,

214
00:10:24,021 --> 00:10:26,540
middle class suburban lifestyle.
That's what trevor you looked like.

215
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:27,374
It looked like a surface hub that was 
built mostly in the ninth save between 

216
00:10:29,691 --> 00:10:32,690
the 1950s in the 1970s.
So

217
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:34,223
the young Jordan and the then young 
Tammy and you have to tell us that 

218
00:10:36,731 --> 00:10:39,400
story,
how you met but wanted one and more.

219
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:41,703
Well,
you know,

220
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:45,370
I think that's one thing that is 
different to some degree about

221
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,650
class.
Um Hm.

222
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:50,503
My father and my mother had both left 
the towns they were from and they were 

223
00:10:52,941 --> 00:10:56,360
forward future looking people.
And you know,

224
00:10:56,361 --> 00:10:59,750
most of my friends who quit school and 
who didn't attend university,

225
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,390
they didn't have,

226
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:06,750
they didn't have that sense.
I would say that more developed sense of

227
00:11:06,751 --> 00:11:10,230
a world outside of what they knew.
And the other thing is that my,

228
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,470
my father took us on long trips when I 
was a kid.

229
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:14,603
He was a teacher and so he had summer 
holidays and we drove all over western 

230
00:11:18,301 --> 00:11:20,940
Canada and down into the u s long 
driving trips,

231
00:11:20,941 --> 00:11:22,830
thousands of miles.
And you know,

232
00:11:22,831 --> 00:11:25,830
that also gave us the sense that the 
world was a bigger place.

233
00:11:25,831 --> 00:11:30,810
But I knew way before I was 12 I believe
that I was off at least to university.

234
00:11:30,811 --> 00:11:35,550
And I think generally in your family,
if you're liable to go to university,

235
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,533
people don't even really talk about it.
It's just a given that that's what's 

236
00:11:39,121 --> 00:11:40,060
going to happen.
It's,

237
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:40,923
it's something that,
that you take in with every breath 

238
00:11:43,951 --> 00:11:45,600
almost.
It's,

239
00:11:45,601 --> 00:11:46,434
it's an,
it's an often an unspoken expectation 

240
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,440
and maybe people make casual reference 
like,

241
00:11:52,441 --> 00:11:53,274
well when you go to college,
but it's not like there's a question 

242
00:11:55,931 --> 00:11:56,764
about it.
Whereas if you're from a working class 

243
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:01,660
background,
especially if your family hasn't pursued

244
00:12:01,661 --> 00:12:02,494
postsecondary education that isn't in 
the realm of unspoken or spoken 

245
00:12:06,551 --> 00:12:08,590
expectation.
And it wasn't like,

246
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,453
like lots of my friends,
including many of them who dropped out 

247
00:12:11,321 --> 00:12:13,880
before they hit high school,
they weren't by,

248
00:12:13,881 --> 00:12:17,170
they were by no means the dumbest people
in the class.

249
00:12:17,171 --> 00:12:22,171
Like they were plenty smart but they 
weren't oriented towards the idea of,

250
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:26,980
of pursuing a career that,
that involved intellectual,

251
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:27,973
um,

252
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:33,270
what intellectual engagement wasn't in 
their worldview.

253
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:36,660
And you know,
when you hear people on the,

254
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,330
let's say more socialists end of the 
distribution,

255
00:12:39,331 --> 00:12:40,164
talk about barriers to education,
they are often talk about cost and 

256
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,090
sometimes cost is a barrier and,
and,

257
00:12:45,091 --> 00:12:46,800
and it's more of a barrier.
Yeah.

258
00:12:46,801 --> 00:12:47,634
And it's more of a barrier,
although there's still plenty of 

259
00:12:48,931 --> 00:12:49,764
community colleges,
state colleges where you can get 

260
00:12:51,721 --> 00:12:54,420
educated for a perfectly reasonable 
amount of money.

261
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:55,613
But for my friends,
it was never a reason that money was 

262
00:12:58,891 --> 00:12:59,724
never a reason.
They didn't pursue post secondary 

263
00:13:00,961 --> 00:13:01,794
education.
It was more like a truncated view of 

264
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:07,230
time,
I would say.

265
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:08,123
You know,
there was more of an emphasis on the 

266
00:13:09,241 --> 00:13:12,930
here and now and there were jobs aplenty
well there was also that,

267
00:13:12,931 --> 00:13:13,520
yeah.
And,

268
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,353
and well paying jobs,
like it wasn't obvious that you were in 

269
00:13:16,471 --> 00:13:19,270
better shape economically to go to 
university then.

270
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:20,430
Oh yeah.
Loss.

271
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:22,600
Especially if you were doing something 
like working on the oil rates.

272
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:23,450
Right.
But,

273
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,373
but

274
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:26,340
you know,
that was rough,

275
00:13:26,341 --> 00:13:28,170
cold,
harsh work and it wasn't,

276
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:32,520
it wasn't once you had an inn you could 
stay employed,

277
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:35,430
but it wasn't that easy to land an entry
level job either.

278
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:36,863
And so,

279
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,713
mmm.

280
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:39,263
Yeah.
Well it was wise for lots of working 

281
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:40,944
class people to,
to work in those jobs because they were 

282
00:13:43,351 --> 00:13:45,450
unbelievably lucrative.
So,

283
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,343
and they should have been because they 
were very difficult and dangerous and 

284
00:13:48,241 --> 00:13:49,320
frigid cold.
And,

285
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:50,700
and,
and rough.

286
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:51,563
So,
you know,

287
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:53,220
it's not like the people didn't earn 
your money.

288
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:56,700
Let's just tell us quickly how you met 
your wife.

289
00:13:56,701 --> 00:13:59,640
You were,
you met her when you were seven or eight

290
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:03,390
are in grade three and grade three yeah.
And you,

291
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:08,420
did you fall in love with her in grade 
three and grade three and was it mutual?

292
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:11,720
Mm,

293
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:15,110
not in the beginning.
She wouldn't admit it if it was,

294
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:17,000
there were lots of the boys in grade 
three.

295
00:14:17,001 --> 00:14:20,540
We are in love with her.
She had a whole little crew of guys that

296
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:21,374
were perfectly willing to follow her 
around and she was perfectly willing to 

297
00:14:24,051 --> 00:14:27,770
exploit that.
She was very good at it.

298
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:28,693
Yeah.
She was very popular and a little girl 

299
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:34,550
so wonderful that you met his children.
They were friends for a long time.

300
00:14:34,551 --> 00:14:35,384
You know,
we used to play chess together and 

301
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,960
croquet and she was a vicious croquet 
player.

302
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:39,853
She would,
I don't know if you've ever played 

303
00:14:40,971 --> 00:14:41,804
croquet,
but if it's your balls touch then you 

304
00:14:44,901 --> 00:14:45,734
can stand on European whack it and then 
the other person's ball will vanish off 

305
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:51,710
into the stratosphere.
She liked it,

306
00:14:51,711 --> 00:14:54,760
knock it all the way down the street and
then she laughed.

307
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:59,060
No.
So she always had a good sense of good,

308
00:14:59,061 --> 00:14:59,894
vicious sense of humor.
It's one of the things actually admire 

309
00:15:01,441 --> 00:15:05,450
about my wife when we're not,
when we've had our verbal disputes,

310
00:15:05,451 --> 00:15:06,284
which you know of certainly happened.
She can string together a sequence of 

311
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:11,190
insults.
That's so hair raising.

312
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:14,620
You have to laugh.
I was like,

313
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,820
did she have brothers?
Um,

314
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,890
she did.
She hasn't brother much older age,

315
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:21,610
eight years older.
Quite a peaceful person.

316
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:25,540
And she had two brothers to can get 
along with guys,

317
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:25,851
guys,
guys.

318
00:15:25,851 --> 00:15:27,500
Yeah.
They would,

319
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:30,710
they show love and affection by insults.
Yeah.

320
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,713
And Jabs and jeers and yeah,
and if you and I had brother and I 

321
00:15:34,301 --> 00:15:35,290
started learned,
okay,

322
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:36,750
I get it,
but if you don't have brothers,

323
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,541
girls like,
oh,

324
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:38,650
that's so rude.
That's so,

325
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:39,970
yeah.
So she was,

326
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,071
yeah.
Well she,

327
00:15:41,071 --> 00:15:42,070
she,
she has a,

328
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:43,680
naturally,
it was maybe a case,

329
00:15:43,681 --> 00:15:46,480
she came by it naturally,
she should get

330
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,280
farther is,
uh,

331
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:49,970
quite sharp.
Witted and,

332
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,570
and,
and um,

333
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,130
well,
he was a real town character.

334
00:15:53,131 --> 00:15:54,180
He's still alive,
Huh?

335
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:57,150
He was a real character and the tone in 
real hyper extrovert,

336
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:58,043
everybody knew him and he had a pretty 
good with torn him and she had some of 

337
00:16:02,191 --> 00:16:04,080
that while it still does have some of 
that.

338
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,480
So she was uh,
you know,

339
00:16:06,481 --> 00:16:08,490
aside from her acerbic yeah.

340
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:11,560
Humor and her ability to whack balls and
yeah.

341
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,610
I just don't want to go further on that 
description and that could have many,

342
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,200
many things that tells us about you.
What else?

343
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:20,880
What else attract.
I mean,

344
00:16:20,881 --> 00:16:23,460
you've known her pretty much your whole 
life,

345
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:24,323
so some of the other qualities that not 
just attracted you but enable you to 

346
00:16:28,141 --> 00:16:29,070
sustain.
I mean,

347
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,800
I think every young person in this room 
will want to know,

348
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,410
and maybe there isn't one,
but what's the secret?

349
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:35,940
What's it like to be with someone that 
long?

350
00:16:35,941 --> 00:16:37,770
How do you sustain that?

351
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,730
You're fortunate.
Some of it's,

352
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,190
some of it's good fortune.
Um,

353
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,840
you know,
and I would say this is true.

354
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,820
I've watched people in the 
relationships,

355
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:47,800
you know,
personally for a long time,

356
00:16:47,801 --> 00:16:48,634
but also as a professional because I've 
done a lot of clinical counseling and I 

357
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:55,660
mean there's some things that need to be
a given about the relationship.

358
00:16:55,661 --> 00:16:56,610
I would say.
Um,

359
00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:00,220
it doesn't hurt to find the other person
very attractive,

360
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:01,151
you know?
And,

361
00:17:01,151 --> 00:17:01,984
and that's a mysterious thing.
We're not exactly sure what it is that 

362
00:17:05,081 --> 00:17:07,330
produces,
let's say chemistry between people.

363
00:17:07,331 --> 00:17:09,970
Although chemistry is definitely part of
what produces it.

364
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:13,300
There's subtle things that attract 
people to one another that are way below

365
00:17:13,301 --> 00:17:15,820
the level of consciousness.
So for example,

366
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:21,120
women don't like the older of men who 
have rh blood factors,

367
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:26,980
who if they had children with would be 
likely to produce a stillborn infant.

368
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:29,670
That's definitely a category of 
match.com

369
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,120
well,
it's so strange though,

370
00:17:33,121 --> 00:17:37,200
because you even know that's a good 
question.

371
00:17:37,201 --> 00:17:37,921
And you know,
you know,

372
00:17:37,921 --> 00:17:40,110
by older apparently,
and so,

373
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,450
um,
there's all wearing cologne.

374
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:44,503
Well,
that then it would depend on what type 

375
00:17:45,691 --> 00:17:50,310
of colonias are h what was the smell is 
a strange

376
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,513
sense.
And it's very deeply tied to very 

377
00:17:53,461 --> 00:17:55,590
profound emotions,
including memory.

378
00:17:55,591 --> 00:18:00,591
And so you find people attractive for 
reasons that you can't always determine.

379
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,500
And so,
so that,

380
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:05,363
that was part of it.
I mean I've always found her very 

381
00:18:07,021 --> 00:18:11,940
attractive in that continues and I liked
her combativeness you know,

382
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:15,210
like I think that there's,
you want someone,

383
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:16,283
I think in a relationship that you can 
spar with and it's partly because you 

384
00:18:22,981 --> 00:18:27,981
have hard problems to solve and if the 
person that you're with isn't willing to

385
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:29,603
put forward their opinion,
then you only have half the cognitive 

386
00:18:32,881 --> 00:18:35,810
power that you would otherwise have no 
one.

387
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:39,810
Hopefully you find someone who's 
interestingly different from you,

388
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:40,913
like not so different that you can't 
communicate and you have to be careful 

389
00:18:43,261 --> 00:18:45,450
of that.
But interestingly different.

390
00:18:45,451 --> 00:18:46,284
And then hopefully they have the ability
and the will to express their opinion 

391
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,050
and then all,
then it's,

392
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,140
you know,
then then your interest stays heightened

393
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,540
and there has to be that tension in a 
relationship.

394
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:58,560
You know,
people think,

395
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:02,480
well I want to get along perfectly with 
my partner.

396
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,750
It's like,
no,

397
00:19:03,751 --> 00:19:05,160
you,
you probably don't.

398
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:08,520
You just get bored.
And then you'd go looking for trouble.

399
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:11,910
And so you want it a little bit of 
trouble in the relationship and a little

400
00:19:11,911 --> 00:19:14,420
bit of mystery and a little bit of 
combativeness and,

401
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:19,270
and the ability to exchange opinions 
forthrightly and,

402
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,460
and I trust her,
which is a huge element.

403
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:24,241
I mean,
when,

404
00:19:24,241 --> 00:19:27,690
when we finally did decide to get 
together permanently,

405
00:19:27,691 --> 00:19:30,530
we're both in our later twenties.
And you know,

406
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:35,540
one of the things that I had learned by 
that point and insisted to her about was

407
00:19:36,451 --> 00:19:41,451
that we had to tell each other the truth
and she took to that wholeheartedly,

408
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:46,270
you know?
And um,

409
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,050
for better and for worse,
because truths can be harsh.

410
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:50,940
Does that include like,
does this,

411
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:51,774
how fit?

412
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:54,391
Yeah.
Well,

413
00:19:54,391 --> 00:19:55,224
the truthful answer to that is I don't 
answer questions that are likely to get 

414
00:19:57,361 --> 00:19:58,194
me in trouble.

415
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:00,993
Yeah.
So I have a son who will answer 

416
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:05,320
honestly,
and it's infuriating.

417
00:20:05,321 --> 00:20:07,300
But then I realized if you want the 
truth,

418
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,220
talk to Tamworth telling you,
well,

419
00:20:09,221 --> 00:20:10,180
that's the thing,
you know,

420
00:20:10,181 --> 00:20:11,014
it's,
it's useful to know truth is empowering 

421
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,353
truth.
Tellers are charismatic and he never 

422
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,940
actually,
both my sons are like brutally honest,

423
00:20:18,941 --> 00:20:20,510
which is disconcerting.
Yeah.

424
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:21,843
But it's,
I can see that it has made them very 

425
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,220
formidable.
And,

426
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:32,410
and because of the people trust them and
the friendships and just,

427
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,800
it gives them a,
and you've written a lot about that.

428
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:35,681
Well,
you know,

429
00:20:35,681 --> 00:20:37,780
if,
if I tell my wife that she looks good in

430
00:20:37,781 --> 00:20:39,250
that outfit,
she knows that I mean it.

431
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,320
Yeah.
And so there's some utility.

432
00:20:41,321 --> 00:20:41,690
Yeah.

433
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:44,410
And then if you're silent and say,
I don't answer questions that she,

434
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:47,470
she goes and change,
well sometimes sometimes know,

435
00:20:47,471 --> 00:20:48,010
she'll say,

436
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:48,970
you know,
do you like this?

437
00:20:48,971 --> 00:20:51,810
And I'll tell her that I don't,
you know,

438
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:54,820
and that doesn't necessarily make her 
happy in the moment,

439
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,260
but,
um,

440
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,500
but if I do say,
I like it,

441
00:20:59,501 --> 00:21:01,660
she knows that I mean in,
and you know,

442
00:21:01,661 --> 00:21:03,370
I actually liked her sense of style a 
lot.

443
00:21:03,371 --> 00:21:06,520
So it turns out that 90% of the time 
it's pretty easy for me to say,

444
00:21:06,521 --> 00:21:08,740
look,
I think you look great and mean it.

445
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:10,203
And,
uh,

446
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:11,163
you know,
she's a fairly harsh standard bearer to 

447
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:13,564
like,
she's,

448
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:18,750
she's insisted that I stay in whatever 
reasonable physical shape I happen to be

449
00:21:18,851 --> 00:21:19,421
in.
You know,

450
00:21:19,421 --> 00:21:20,254
that was,
that was something that she's very 

451
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:22,653
demanding of it.
I would say that it's the same from my 

452
00:21:24,641 --> 00:21:29,641
side and um,
and we've been good at negotiating,

453
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,450
which is,
you know,

454
00:21:31,451 --> 00:21:33,850
what do you want from a partner?
Fundamentally?

455
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,290
What,
what do you want need,

456
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:38,310
I mean the first thing is,
is that we'll hopefully you,

457
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,153
like I said,
you're blessed with the fact that you 

458
00:21:40,421 --> 00:21:44,380
find each other attractive and I think 
it's very difficult for the relationship

459
00:21:44,381 --> 00:21:49,381
to begin or proceed or sustain itself 
without that.

460
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:51,063
But having that,
then what do you want while you want 

461
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:55,750
someone that you can trust,
do you want someone that you can build a

462
00:21:55,751 --> 00:21:59,650
view of the future with and you want 
someone that you can negotiate with?

463
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:00,484
And that's very hard to negotiate with 
people because they have to tell you 

464
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:04,803
what they think.
They have to know what they want or 

465
00:22:06,911 --> 00:22:09,010
figure it out.
They have to tell you what they want.

466
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:11,920
They have to be satisfied when they get 
what they want,

467
00:22:11,921 --> 00:22:13,960
which is also a very difficult thing to 
manage.

468
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:18,250
And you have to continually update that 
because your life goes through different

469
00:22:18,251 --> 00:22:21,070
stages and well in your attraction.
Wayne's,

470
00:22:21,071 --> 00:22:26,040
as we all know at our stage of like not 
Badaliya necessarily player's health,

471
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:28,360
but,
but no,

472
00:22:28,361 --> 00:22:31,420
but you will go,
I mean you will not be 25 forever,

473
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:34,480
so,
so that that has to be renegotiated.

474
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,100
Yeah,
well then you have to work at that too.

475
00:22:36,101 --> 00:22:36,521
Right?
You know,

476
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:37,354
and,
and that's something that people also 

477
00:22:38,141 --> 00:22:38,974
don't understand because they tend to 
think that well that that all romantic 

478
00:22:44,261 --> 00:22:47,260
interaction should be spontaneous.
It's like,

479
00:22:47,261 --> 00:22:48,580
well,
if that's your theory,

480
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:52,360
then you might as well just give up 
right now if you're going to get married

481
00:22:52,361 --> 00:22:56,200
because that like the only reason you 
can think that is because you don't have

482
00:22:56,201 --> 00:23:00,220
enough responsibility to make romantic 
entanglement virtually impossible.

483
00:23:00,221 --> 00:23:03,010
And what happens when you're married,
especially when you have little kids,

484
00:23:03,011 --> 00:23:05,500
is that,
and you both have a job,

485
00:23:05,501 --> 00:23:06,334
let's say,
is you're so busy that the probability 

486
00:23:08,231 --> 00:23:09,064
that you're going to find time for 
spontaneous mutual interaction is 

487
00:23:12,191 --> 00:23:15,910
decreases to zero.
And so if that's what you're hoping for,

488
00:23:15,911 --> 00:23:16,744
then you're never going to have it.
And so what you have to do is you have 

489
00:23:18,581 --> 00:23:19,870
to make time for each other.

490
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:22,150
And you know,
if you're dating,

491
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:24,670
um,
when you're establishing a relationship,

492
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,680
while you put some effort into it,
you know,

493
00:23:26,681 --> 00:23:27,514
you,
you decide that you're going to go out 

494
00:23:28,691 --> 00:23:31,150
for dinner and you dress up to some 
degree and you know,

495
00:23:31,151 --> 00:23:31,984
you try to present yourself to each 
other in some halfways mutually 

496
00:23:34,601 --> 00:23:35,434
acceptable manner and you hope that 
there's going to be a positive 

497
00:23:38,081 --> 00:23:38,914
consequence of that,
that you're going to find each other 

498
00:23:40,091 --> 00:23:40,924
attractive.
But then as people somehow think that 

499
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:43,863
once they're married,
that the same amount of effort isn't 

500
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:48,080
necessary.
And that's wrong.

501
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,393
I would say more effort is necessary on 
the same front and you have to think it 

502
00:23:53,601 --> 00:23:54,440
through.
It's like,

503
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:58,580
you know,
if you don't want to be bitter about the

504
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,833
intimate element of your relationship,
how much time do you have to spend 

505
00:24:02,631 --> 00:24:04,280
together each week?
And My,

506
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:05,683
my rule of thumb,
sort of derived from clinical 

507
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:07,874
observations is that you need to spend 
90 minutes a week with your partner 

508
00:24:11,421 --> 00:24:12,254
talking.

509
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:17,390
And that means you're telling each other
about your life and staying in touch,

510
00:24:17,391 --> 00:24:18,224
you know,
so that you each know what the other is 

511
00:24:19,401 --> 00:24:23,390
up to and you're discussing what needs 
to be done to keep the household running

512
00:24:23,391 --> 00:24:24,224
smoothly.
And you're laying out some mutually 

513
00:24:26,271 --> 00:24:27,104
acceptable vision of how the next week 
or the next months are going to go 

514
00:24:29,751 --> 00:24:30,441
together.
Right.

515
00:24:30,441 --> 00:24:31,274
So that,
that keeps your narratives locked 

516
00:24:32,691 --> 00:24:33,351
together.
Like,

517
00:24:33,351 --> 00:24:35,060
uh,
like the strands in a rope,

518
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,013
you need that for 90 minutes or you 
drift apart and you need to spend 

519
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:43,490
intimate time together at least once a 
week and probably more like twice.

520
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,460
And that has to be negotiated.
And if you don't negotiate it,

521
00:24:46,461 --> 00:24:50,480
and if you don't make it a priority,
then it won't happen in all likelihood.

522
00:24:50,481 --> 00:24:51,800
And then,
well,

523
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:55,730
well then you don't have it.
That's a catastrophe because there's not

524
00:24:55,731 --> 00:24:57,920
that many things in life that are,
you know,

525
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:00,230
intrinsically,
what would you say?

526
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:03,920
Engaging in meaningful and pleasurable 
and also bonding,

527
00:25:03,921 --> 00:25:06,530
all of that.
And if you let that go,

528
00:25:06,531 --> 00:25:10,610
then well part of you dies and part of 
the relationship dies.

529
00:25:10,611 --> 00:25:11,444
And while then there's always the 
possibility of becoming attracted by 

530
00:25:13,941 --> 00:25:16,040
alternative entanglement,
which,

531
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:18,800
which you would do if you had any spirit
left.

532
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,233
Right?
I mean that's the thing is if you're 

533
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:22,940
not,
if you're,

534
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:26,960
if your relationship at home is entirely
unsatisfying sexually,

535
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,390
what are you supposed to do with that?
Nothing.

536
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,490
He was supposed to just bear it.
I mean,

537
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,250
in one way the answer is yes because 
it's your marriage,

538
00:25:34,251 --> 00:25:36,550
but another way as well,
what,

539
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,393
that's all the fight you've got in you.
You're going to just let the erotic 

540
00:25:40,521 --> 00:25:41,354
element of your life die and accept 
everything that goes along with that 

541
00:25:44,781 --> 00:25:45,614
because you're not willing to causing a 
bit of trouble to ensure that it's 

542
00:25:49,821 --> 00:25:51,800
maintained.
And you know,

543
00:25:51,801 --> 00:25:54,830
and we're not very good at thinking 
these things through consciously and it,

544
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:57,530
I mean,
people are bad at negotiating period.

545
00:25:57,531 --> 00:25:59,930
As far as I can tell,
but they're particularly bad.

546
00:25:59,931 --> 00:26:02,000
It negotiating things that are deeply 
private.

547
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:05,120
How much do you want your partner to 
know about you anyways,

548
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,673
it takes a lot of trust to have a real 
conversation about what you need and 

549
00:26:10,731 --> 00:26:11,564
want.

550
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:17,980
Now you have it in the press.
People read that you are,

551
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:22,160
uh,
you have a following of young men.

552
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,593
And I went to hear your lecture in 
Washington DC and there were a lot of 

553
00:26:26,391 --> 00:26:29,920
women there and your book,
I am,

554
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:31,483
first of all,
men don't buy books that often compared 

555
00:26:33,081 --> 00:26:33,914
to women.
So I'm presuming you have a lot of 

556
00:26:35,061 --> 00:26:36,350
female readers.
And I found it,

557
00:26:36,351 --> 00:26:36,981
Jay,
Danielle,

558
00:26:36,981 --> 00:26:41,981
and I found it completely readable.
And it wasn't a ribbon for men.

559
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,280
No,
it was one.

560
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,270
So you have more like a delusional

561
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:48,880
desire on the part of the radical 
leftists that the only people that could

562
00:26:48,881 --> 00:26:51,250
possibly be attracted to me or angry 
men.

563
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,293
Exactly.
It'd be better if they were angry young 

564
00:26:53,621 --> 00:26:54,580
white men,
you know,

565
00:26:54,581 --> 00:26:56,020
because then that fits the narrative.

566
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:59,590
But you have a diverse audience,
a diverse following,

567
00:26:59,591 --> 00:27:02,890
including many women.
And they're also not particularly angry.

568
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:06,490
I mean,
I've talked to 200 fusing the anchor.

569
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:08,610
That's the point of your book is 
stopping angry,

570
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:09,500
stomping,
resent.

571
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,121
All right,
well,

572
00:27:10,121 --> 00:27:12,670
resentment is that that's absolutely 
crippling,

573
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,780
right?
Get resentment.

574
00:27:13,781 --> 00:27:16,420
Just zenman deceit,
arrogance.

575
00:27:16,421 --> 00:27:17,254
That's part of,
I'm writing another book and one of the 

576
00:27:18,611 --> 00:27:23,611
rules is don't allow yourself to become 
resentful,

577
00:27:23,921 --> 00:27:24,970
deceitful,
deceitful,

578
00:27:24,971 --> 00:27:27,190
and arrogant or those two things 
together.

579
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,260
But it could be red.

580
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:30,960
Right?
Well,

581
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,180
that's supposed to be a good thing.
So yeah,

582
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,810
there's been 250,000
people,

583
00:27:35,811 --> 00:27:36,644
as I said,
come to the lectures and there hasn't 

584
00:27:37,611 --> 00:27:39,320
been a single negative incident.

585
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:40,323
Not One.
This is what I find fascinating is that 

586
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:48,250
I found you early on.
I said I had no idea you were just that.

587
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:51,310
It was like butch cassidy and the 
Sundance kid.

588
00:27:51,311 --> 00:27:53,590
Like who is that guy?
Who is that guy?

589
00:27:53,591 --> 00:27:54,424
Like you were pretty good.
And we were covering a lot of the same 

590
00:27:57,581 --> 00:27:58,960
topics later on.
Yeah.

591
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,670
Wow.
And then,

592
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:02,440
you know,
I found out who you were.

593
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:07,270
What is astonishing to me is that 
there's this amazing,

594
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,573
it just split between the positivity of 
your audience and diversity of your 

595
00:28:13,121 --> 00:28:13,954
audience,
the,

596
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:17,770
the intellectual content of your 
message.

597
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:20,950
And then you get with a snarky 
journalist with an agenda,

598
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:23,480
and I'm not mentioning names,
but this,

599
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,880
no,
maybe no,

600
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:30,980
this,
this young woman from Gq and it was just

601
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:34,600
me on site and I'd say,
and it was just like few lady.

602
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:35,510
Gotcha.
Gotcha.

603
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:37,840
For,
we didn't want to blame the BBC,

604
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:41,780
it was two or a saint and then I,
and she seemed,

605
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:44,410
you know,
like as often she seemed intelligent and

606
00:28:44,411 --> 00:28:45,244
capable of insight up to a point.
But it's almost as if something gets 

607
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:53,910
seized her mind and show you something,
had something happen.

608
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:57,630
I think people enjoy the meal.
Polyols it.

609
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,950
Can you a Polya says that a whole 
generation,

610
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:05,010
some of our most talented young women 
are incapable because of this idea.

611
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:09,520
Maybe you mean,
or just an openness to,

612
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:10,623
she couldn't,
and you were saying completely like 

613
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:13,840
interesting,
fascinating,

614
00:29:13,841 --> 00:29:18,400
original things even to me who've 
studied these topics and wow.

615
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,260
And

616
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,370
No,
it was quite the day.

617
00:29:20,371 --> 00:29:22,410
So I went to Baltimore.
You survived.

618
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:23,933
It made me think a lot that day because 
I went there and I have to go out of my 

619
00:29:28,501 --> 00:29:30,540
way to do it.
Not that I'm complaining,

620
00:29:30,541 --> 00:29:33,060
but there's a reason for saying that,
you know,

621
00:29:33,061 --> 00:29:34,990
so I go up there in Baltimore.
Yeah,

622
00:29:34,991 --> 00:29:36,850
well I was talking in Baltimore.
Oh,

623
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,790
okay.
So where's the aquarium?

624
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:39,693
And I showed up to the,
to the hotel room where this was all 

625
00:29:42,221 --> 00:29:44,890
occurring.
And you know what you expect,

626
00:29:44,891 --> 00:29:48,130
generally speaking,
even from journalists who aren't,

627
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:49,833
you know,
who are more of the attack dog variety 

628
00:29:51,131 --> 00:29:51,964
or who may be,
aren't positively predisposed to 

629
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:55,143
ideologically or personally,
you expect a certain modicum of 

630
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,520
professional politeness.
Right.

631
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:01,383
You know,
because,

632
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:03,220
well,
you don't have to be there.

633
00:30:03,221 --> 00:30:07,240
And you came and you accepted an 
invitation and all of that.

634
00:30:07,241 --> 00:30:09,910
And so even with the channel for 
journalists,

635
00:30:09,911 --> 00:30:11,370
Kathy Newman,
um,

636
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:14,950
she was quite polite and,
and forthcoming in the,

637
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:17,860
in the green room before the interview.

638
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:20,980
So she would have had at least that 
professional persona,

639
00:30:20,981 --> 00:30:23,170
which is,
it's not nothing right there.

640
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,033
There's something to be said for,
for going through the motions 

641
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:29,380
professionally in an inappropriate 
manner.

642
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:33,190
But when I walked into the hotel room in
Baltimore,

643
00:30:33,191 --> 00:30:34,024
it was obvious that this interviewer had
already made up her mind about me 100% 

644
00:30:38,351 --> 00:30:41,230
and that she was absolutely,
you know,

645
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:45,010
negatively predisposed to me with a 
personal animus.

646
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:45,913
Animus is exactly the right word.
And there was about a half an hour 

647
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:54,000
photography session because it was Gq.
And so I was in that atmosphere.

648
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:54,853
The photographers were fine.
I was in that atmosphere for about 45 

649
00:30:57,311 --> 00:31:01,330
minutes before we started to talk.
And part of the reason that I'm so,

650
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:06,340
uh,
I'm not as calm during that interview is

651
00:31:06,341 --> 00:31:08,020
I usually am,
I'm a little bit harsher.

652
00:31:08,021 --> 00:31:10,210
And the reason for that is that,
you know,

653
00:31:10,211 --> 00:31:13,530
it just started off instantly combative 
and,

654
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:16,060
and what I,
what I should have done,

655
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:17,980
you see,
it's very,

656
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:18,963
very difficult to be awake enough to do 
these things properly and to end the 

657
00:31:23,771 --> 00:31:26,140
interview progressed fine.
Although by the end of it,

658
00:31:26,141 --> 00:31:26,974
I thought that I had maybe done enough 
interviews for a while because I didn't 

659
00:31:29,441 --> 00:31:34,090
think I had regulated my temper as well 
during that interview as I might've,

660
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,290
I was harsh.
Good.

661
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:37,010
Well for the first two minutes,

662
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:37,943
so you were getting at and then she 
brought up a question about anger and I 

663
00:31:41,041 --> 00:31:44,790
just saw you kind of adjust and then 
after that it was smooth.

664
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,970
Well that's good because it was touch 
and go,

665
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:47,990
you know,
and I thought,

666
00:31:47,991 --> 00:31:48,741
boy,
you know,

667
00:31:48,741 --> 00:31:50,530
maybe you're running out of patients,
maybe you,

668
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:51,463
you know,
maybe it's time to dial back on the 

669
00:31:52,671 --> 00:31:53,504
interviews because you know,
I've had many interviews like that and 

670
00:31:56,001 --> 00:31:58,520
they're very,
I find them like,

671
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,240
and it takes me like three days to weeks

672
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:03,430
and then you start thinking of yourself 
like what I should have said,

673
00:32:03,431 --> 00:32:05,130
I should have said that and I drive 
myself mad.

674
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:06,700
No,
but you did very well.

675
00:32:06,701 --> 00:32:07,534
But it's so interesting that what it 
told me was how parochial she was and 

676
00:32:12,701 --> 00:32:16,930
she lives in her own little world and 
Stina isn't that more a little bit about

677
00:32:16,931 --> 00:32:19,990
the ideology of our time and Gosh,
you encountered this everywhere.

678
00:32:19,991 --> 00:32:22,900
And when I used to write about this 
wisely,

679
00:32:22,901 --> 00:32:23,920
I would,
I would encounter it.

680
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,233
I mean,
I think part of the issue is that you 

681
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:32,890
will acknowledge that there are 
differences between the sexes.

682
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,930
That seems to be,
I know that's a hell of a no,

683
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:39,650
that's a heresy because when I was 
reading your book,

684
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:40,843
um,
there's nothing about it that is anti 

685
00:32:46,371 --> 00:32:47,204
female affecting you.
You do a lot of examination of the Adam 

686
00:32:50,061 --> 00:32:53,390
and Eve story and you have this 
wonderful passage about like,

687
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,433
um,
Adam being the originally aggrieved man 

688
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:56,570
who

689
00:32:56,570 --> 00:33:01,570
throws the woman under the bus.
The original fault you made her.

690
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,140
I'm hiding.
That's really funny.

691
00:33:06,141 --> 00:33:07,340
So,
so,

692
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:08,650
so there's nothing in there

693
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:09,520
and,
and the,

694
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,620
the rules such as they are,
you know,

695
00:33:11,621 --> 00:33:15,280
they seem very common sensical.
They could apply to anyone.

696
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:20,200
Um,
so is that a fair surmise of why you get

697
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,790
so attacked?
Uh,

698
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,633
that just the very fact that you're 
willing to speak about the sexes as 

699
00:33:26,321 --> 00:33:28,840
being not unequal but different.
Funny.

700
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:29,950
Cool.
Yeah.

701
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,090
Well,
you know what,

702
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:36,850
I would say that that's part of it 
because there's a threat there.

703
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:40,030
So one of the things that happen when I 
was in Scandinavia,

704
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:42,190
I just wrote a column about this 
actually,

705
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:44,890
um,
was interesting being in Scandinavia,

706
00:33:44,891 --> 00:33:45,724
especially in Sweden because they've 
pushed the equality of opportunity 

707
00:33:49,001 --> 00:33:51,310
doctrine farther than any other country.

708
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,233
They invented it.
It almost started there like in the UN 

709
00:33:54,821 --> 00:33:56,540
and the original,
you know,

710
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:58,930
the charter,
the Swedes were there and they,

711
00:33:58,931 --> 00:33:59,764
they've never given

712
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:00,681
no,
no.

713
00:34:00,681 --> 00:34:01,514
And so,
and the week that I was there was the 

714
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:09,200
same week that two articles were 
published on gender differences,

715
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:10,760
um,
in,

716
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,013
in temperament and in interest.
And the biggest sex differences that we 

717
00:34:15,231 --> 00:34:20,210
know of that aren't morphological are in
interest.

718
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:24,860
So women are more interested in people 
by and large and men are more interested

719
00:34:24,861 --> 00:34:28,130
in things by and large.
And the difference is actually large.

720
00:34:28,131 --> 00:34:32,150
It's one standard deviation.
And so that means if you're a man,

721
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,793
you would have to be more interested in 
people than 85% of men to be as 

722
00:34:37,641 --> 00:34:41,270
interested as 50% of women.
And if you're a woman,

723
00:34:41,271 --> 00:34:42,104
you'd have to be more interested in 
things than 85% of women to be as 

724
00:34:45,831 --> 00:34:46,664
interested as the 50th percentile male.
So the difference is actually quite 

725
00:34:50,061 --> 00:34:50,894
substantial and it's certainly large 
enough to drive occupational choice 

726
00:34:54,741 --> 00:34:55,574
differences,
which is does it explains a lot about 

727
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:00,610
the configuration of people in the 
workplace?

728
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:01,581
Absolutely.
Well,

729
00:35:01,581 --> 00:35:02,414
and you know,
we're approaching approaching parody in 

730
00:35:04,461 --> 00:35:07,940
terms of workplace overall workplace 
distribution of men and women,

731
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:10,760
but there's massive differences in 
occupational choice.

732
00:35:10,761 --> 00:35:12,470
Like it's very interesting,
for example,

733
00:35:12,471 --> 00:35:13,304
to go to the website of the u s labor 
department and look at male and female 

734
00:35:18,381 --> 00:35:20,840
dominated industries.
And you know,

735
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:21,703
there's the top 10 male dominated 
industries have basically zero women in 

736
00:35:26,511 --> 00:35:27,320
them.
People,

737
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,790
brick layers like

738
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:31,400
people.
There are people free zones according to

739
00:35:31,401 --> 00:35:34,660
Camille Paglia that you find you're just
a lot of men in the people free zones.

740
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:35,480
Yeah,
yeah,

741
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:35,991
yeah,
yeah.

742
00:35:35,991 --> 00:35:38,250
And the women are in ask a group of 
women

743
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,353
and men,
would you rather spend the next three 

744
00:35:41,221 --> 00:35:42,054
weeks taking a part of machine and 
putting it together or helping a group 

745
00:35:44,641 --> 00:35:49,110
of people work out their problems and 
the pool of people who want to do them.

746
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,063
It's just far more men than women.
There's more men and women dominated 

747
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:56,970
industries than there are women and men 
dominated industries at the extreme.

748
00:35:56,971 --> 00:35:59,040
So that's,
would that be like nursing?

749
00:35:59,041 --> 00:36:02,610
Nursing is way more male nurses.
The male nurses,

750
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,210
I've studied these male nurses and they 
already,

751
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,130
uh,
you know,

752
00:36:08,131 --> 00:36:11,670
gender activists are upset because they 
earn more than women.

753
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:13,500
And,
uh,

754
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:14,423
a professor of nursing at University of 
Pennsylvania tried to find out why and 

755
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:22,370
she found out they immediately find out 
what's the best paying field subfield.

756
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:24,840
So they go into like nurse 
anesthesiology,

757
00:36:24,841 --> 00:36:27,660
it pays a lot more than men are there 
and disproportionate number.

758
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,970
And they're willing to work and cry,
you know,

759
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:30,750
insane hours.

760
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,970
They're far more willing to move to a 
higher,

761
00:36:32,971 --> 00:36:34,290
same thing.
Farrell phone with,

762
00:36:34,291 --> 00:36:37,080
with gender differences is that men are 
more willing to move.

763
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,360
Maybe they're more willing.
We're willing to call me yours.

764
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,600
They're more willing to to uh,
work outside.

765
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:44,970
They're more willing to take on 
dangerous tasks.

766
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,700
They're more likely to work in scalable 
industries.

767
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,890
So we'd like,
you can't scale personal care.

768
00:36:49,891 --> 00:36:51,030
It's really,
it's very,

769
00:36:51,031 --> 00:36:51,864
very difficult.
They're much less likely to work part 

770
00:36:53,431 --> 00:36:55,650
time.
If they have small businesses,

771
00:36:55,651 --> 00:36:56,484
they're much more likely to work full 
time in the small business rather than 

772
00:36:58,441 --> 00:36:59,274
this than part time.
And I mean women have the reasons to 

773
00:37:01,741 --> 00:37:02,574
want to work part time and feral also 
pointed out that if you work 10% longer 

774
00:37:06,781 --> 00:37:08,760
hours,
you make 40% more money.

775
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:09,763
A non linear nonlinear return on 
overtime had something that's really 

776
00:37:12,241 --> 00:37:13,074
useful to know in terms of your career 
to an employer that have somewhat also 

777
00:37:17,611 --> 00:37:18,420
marks you out.

778
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:19,253
You know,
like if you have 10 employees and 

779
00:37:20,221 --> 00:37:22,050
they're all doing a reasonable job,
let's say,

780
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,033
but one of them is working an extra half
an hour a day or 45 minutes a day and 

781
00:37:25,891 --> 00:37:26,724
you can observe that every day,
then that gives them an edge with 

782
00:37:28,771 --> 00:37:31,350
regards to potential promotion.
And so,

783
00:37:31,351 --> 00:37:33,870
and the return on those edges is 
nonlinear.

784
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,213
And so anyways,
so I went to Scandinavia and it was the 

785
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:38,843
same week that two studies were released
showing what had already been 

786
00:37:42,631 --> 00:37:47,631
established beyond a shadow of a doubt 
that the personality differences between

787
00:37:47,731 --> 00:37:48,564
men and women and the differences in 
interest as well actually get bigger as 

788
00:37:52,141 --> 00:37:56,290
your society gets richer and as it gets 
more egalitarian and,

789
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:57,403
and not just a little bit either.
That's the other thing that's so 

790
00:37:59,221 --> 00:38:00,054
interesting is you might think,
well the effect is it's the opposite of 

791
00:38:03,361 --> 00:38:05,730
what the social constructionists would 
predict first of all.

792
00:38:05,731 --> 00:38:06,564
So that's the first thing to point out 
is it's not only that their hypothesis 

793
00:38:09,571 --> 00:38:13,750
wasn't supported,
it was decidedly refuted and,

794
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,690
and none of them have come to terms with
that.

795
00:38:15,691 --> 00:38:16,320
And,
and,

796
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,420
and it's not a small effect.
The,

797
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,333
the difference between personality 
between men and women in Scandinavia is 

798
00:38:22,711 --> 00:38:26,880
a lot larger than it is in Noni.
Galitary and contract can rural Botswana

799
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:31,770
true in the United States.
The richer the democratic your household

800
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:33,810
demographic,
your household,

801
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,040
the more likely the woman to take

802
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,590
town timeout and be at home with the 
kid.

803
00:38:37,591 --> 00:38:38,800
Right?
Because she can afford,

804
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:42,490
she can afford to do it and she can 
afford to major in odd,

805
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,740
you know,
low paying fields like a,

806
00:38:44,741 --> 00:38:46,450
I don't know,
feminists dance therapy

807
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,830
you use,
you see to,

808
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,850
one of the things that's also 
interesting I think is that,

809
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:55,070
you know,
there's this idea that mate,

810
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,140
that marriage is a patriarchal 
institution,

811
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:58,850
you know,
that's primarily put there for the,

812
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:01,790
for the utility of the,
of the mail and think,

813
00:39:01,791 --> 00:39:04,340
well like I think that's complete bloody
rubbish.

814
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,620
And I don't think there's any evidence 
to support it at all.

815
00:39:06,621 --> 00:39:08,690
But I think the best counter evidence is
that,

816
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:10,160
well,
if that's the case,

817
00:39:10,161 --> 00:39:10,994
then rich people shouldn't be getting 
married because they don't have to 

818
00:39:14,391 --> 00:39:17,360
oppress themselves.
But the truth of the matter is,

819
00:39:17,361 --> 00:39:19,850
is that the higher your demographic 
position,

820
00:39:19,851 --> 00:39:23,670
the more likely you are to be married.
So marriage has fallen apart among,

821
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:24,603
you know,
in the more likely the wife is staying 

822
00:39:25,841 --> 00:39:27,730
home and not,
I mean,

823
00:39:27,731 --> 00:39:30,520
she has all sorts of pursuits,
but she's not well,

824
00:39:30,521 --> 00:39:31,780
there's an old saying,
anyone,

825
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:33,970
any woman who marries for money earns 
it.

826
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,000
Um,
but now let me just,

827
00:39:37,001 --> 00:39:37,834
okay.
This is where you might get in a little 

828
00:39:38,621 --> 00:39:39,454
trouble because in your book you call 
men order and women chaos and you say 

829
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:44,973
order,
the known appears symbolically 

830
00:39:46,601 --> 00:39:47,434
associated with masculinity and chaos.
The Eternal Feminine is also the 

831
00:39:51,011 --> 00:39:52,960
crushing force of sexual selection.
Yeah.

832
00:39:52,961 --> 00:39:54,270
What's up with that?
Yeah.

833
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:57,590
We chaotic chaos.
Men and women,

834
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,633
order and chaos.
It's masculinity and femininity 

835
00:40:01,551 --> 00:40:02,384
symbolically.
And so what's happened fundamentally is 

836
00:40:05,001 --> 00:40:05,834
that we're,
our brains are wired for social 

837
00:40:09,921 --> 00:40:10,754
cognition.
So we're not natural scientists were 

838
00:40:13,821 --> 00:40:16,450
natural sociologists.
That might be a better,

839
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,860
even though I shutter to think that that
might be true,

840
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:21,050
especially given the stage associates as
well.

841
00:40:21,051 --> 00:40:21,770
That's it.
Okay.

842
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:26,540
Triggering or maybe rick or,
or may him or maybe we're more,

843
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:28,140
we're more naturally,
uh,

844
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:29,413
people who observe through the lens of 
fiction and that what we see as the 

845
00:40:32,271 --> 00:40:37,271
world as characterized and the world,
obviously it's made out of men and women

846
00:40:38,391 --> 00:40:42,770
and children and those seem to be our 
fundamental cognitive categories.

847
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,590
Masculinity,
femininity and,

848
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:45,543
and,
and,

849
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:46,463
and then the category of children and 
those categories have expanded to take 

850
00:40:51,471 --> 00:40:56,471
on connotations outside of,
of pure person perception.

851
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,000
And so,
you know,

852
00:40:59,001 --> 00:40:59,834
it's for this reason that if you go to a
movie and then maybe it's a Disney 

853
00:41:02,691 --> 00:41:03,524
animated movie and I like to talk about 
those because they draw on a very deep 

854
00:41:06,921 --> 00:41:07,754
symbolic,
well it's perfectly reasonable to see a 

855
00:41:10,011 --> 00:41:13,610
witch that lives in a swamp because 
those go together.

856
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:15,360
Like it makes sense.
You know,

857
00:41:15,361 --> 00:41:18,170
the which doesn't live in a gleaming 
chrome high rise,

858
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,553
you know,
she lives in a swamp cause that's a 

859
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,000
maybe an a shock for her room.
I think she could just fly up.

860
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:23,863
Well that's it.
That's where the high rise would be 

861
00:41:25,161 --> 00:41:25,994
better for the brand.
We can take off if you could take off 

862
00:41:28,161 --> 00:41:30,760
better.
But there are categories of,

863
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:34,820
of symbolic association that are natural
to the way we think.

864
00:41:34,821 --> 00:41:38,660
And the fundamental elements of those 
categories seem to be gendered.

865
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:42,110
And so this is partly why I make 
reference to Taoism,

866
00:41:42,111 --> 00:41:42,944
for example.
So for the Dow is the world is made out 

867
00:41:44,631 --> 00:41:49,370
of chaos and order and chaos is the 
domain that you don't understand.

868
00:41:49,371 --> 00:41:54,140
And that emerges unpredictably but also 
the domain from which new forms emerge,

869
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:55,723
right?
Because it's from novelty that the new 

870
00:41:57,291 --> 00:41:58,124
emerges.
And I think the fundamental association 

871
00:42:00,201 --> 00:42:01,034
between femininity,
it chaos is the association between 

872
00:42:03,831 --> 00:42:06,170
what's unexpected and novel and what's 
new.

873
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:11,590
Because new forms emerge from chaos.
And it's not that chaos is,

874
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:14,510
is bad in order is good.
That that's,

875
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:15,000
yeah,
no,

876
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,200
both have their pathologies.
Both have their pathology.

877
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:19,251
Yes.
And,

878
00:42:19,251 --> 00:42:20,540
and,
and what you're looking for,

879
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:21,573
and this is,
this is the book concentrates on above 

880
00:42:23,901 --> 00:42:24,734
all,
is that you're looking constantly to 

881
00:42:25,971 --> 00:42:27,710
find the balance between those two.
So,

882
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:30,260
for example,
formerly speaking,

883
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:34,000
the domain of order is that place that 
you are with.

884
00:42:34,001 --> 00:42:36,650
What you're doing is producing the 
results that you want,

885
00:42:36,651 --> 00:42:39,020
who have produced.
So imagine,

886
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:42,680
imagine you think about the 
preconditions for not being anxious.

887
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:44,533
Okay?
So the preconditions are that you're 

888
00:42:45,381 --> 00:42:48,080
constantly making predictions about 
what's going to happen next.

889
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:52,880
And those predictions are tied tightly 
to your behavioral output.

890
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,330
So you act in a certain way and you 
presume that a certain thing is going to

891
00:42:56,331 --> 00:43:00,050
happen.
And if your actions produced the results

892
00:43:00,051 --> 00:43:00,884
that you desire,
then you assume that you know where you 

893
00:43:02,931 --> 00:43:03,764
are and you know what you're doing and 
that your plan is intact and that the 

894
00:43:06,021 --> 00:43:09,110
environment is secure and that keeps 
your anxiety under control.

895
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:12,230
That's order.
And then you know,

896
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:13,093
maybe you're at a party and you don't 
know anybody and you tell a joke and 

897
00:43:15,561 --> 00:43:19,730
everybody looks at you like what you 
said was not only not funny,

898
00:43:19,731 --> 00:43:20,564
but also downright offensive.
And then all of a sudden you've moved 

899
00:43:23,721 --> 00:43:24,554
from the domain of order into the domain
of chaos because you thought you were 

900
00:43:27,141 --> 00:43:29,480
somewhere and you thought you were 
someone.

901
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:30,314
And you thought you were with people 
that were of a certain type and you got 

902
00:43:33,741 --> 00:43:34,574
all that wrong.
And so it causes the guessing is going 

903
00:43:37,521 --> 00:43:39,940
to be the woman who says,
I find that really open.

904
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:46,100
I'm not suggesting that it probably is,
nevermind,

905
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:48,740
but women are also more sensitive to 
negative emotion,

906
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:49,683
right?
So there is some slightly higher 

907
00:43:50,991 --> 00:43:51,824
probability that that might be the case.
But then I think women are also 

908
00:43:54,711 --> 00:43:55,544
associated,
at least in men's imaginations with 

909
00:43:57,321 --> 00:43:58,154
nature,
which is part of the chaotic domain say 

910
00:43:59,991 --> 00:44:03,950
as opposed to culture because they're 
sexually selective.

911
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:07,130
So you gotta think what?
What is nature?

912
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:10,190
When we have that as a cognitive 
category,

913
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:11,660
right?
We think of the natural world,

914
00:44:11,661 --> 00:44:14,510
we think of nature versus culture.
It's a fundamental opposition.

915
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:16,780
What is nature?
Well,

916
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,610
nature is trees and landscapes and 
animals and all of that.

917
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,670
But that isn't what nature fundamentally
is.

918
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:27,940
Nature fundamentally is that which 
selects from a genetic perspective,

919
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:29,413
that's nature.
That's the fundamental definition of 

920
00:44:31,051 --> 00:44:31,884
nature.
And it is the case that human females 

921
00:44:34,501 --> 00:44:35,334
are sexually selective and it's,
it's a major component of human 

922
00:44:38,551 --> 00:44:40,400
behavior.
So the,

923
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:43,260
the evolutionary theory,
roughly speaking,

924
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:48,500
is that the reason we diverged from 
chimpanzees 8 million years ago,

925
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:50,394
7 million years ago,
is at least in part because of the 

926
00:44:54,151 --> 00:44:54,984
differences between sexual selectively 
between female humans and female 

927
00:44:59,491 --> 00:45:00,324
chimpanzees.
Female chimpanzees are more likely to 

928
00:45:02,701 --> 00:45:03,534
have offspring from dominant males,
but it's not because of their sexual 

929
00:45:07,291 --> 00:45:08,124
selectivities.

930
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:12,720
So a female chimpanzee has periods of 
fertility that are marked by physical,

931
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:15,990
uh,
by observable physiological changes,

932
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:19,740
not the case with human females.
Human female ovulation is,

933
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:20,723
is concealed.
So that's a very profound biological 

934
00:45:23,731 --> 00:45:26,100
difference between human females and 
chimpanzees.

935
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:29,010
And the chimpanzee females will mate 
with any male,

936
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:31,860
but the dominant males chased the 
subordinate males away.

937
00:45:32,790 --> 00:45:35,040
But human females are sexually 
selective.

938
00:45:35,041 --> 00:45:37,110
And so,
and it's not a trivial fact.

939
00:45:37,111 --> 00:45:41,940
So you have twice as many female 
ancestors as male ancestors.

940
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:43,291
You think,
well,

941
00:45:43,291 --> 00:45:44,820
how can that be?
Well,

942
00:45:44,821 --> 00:45:45,654
imagine that on average,
every single human female has had one 

943
00:45:48,541 --> 00:45:50,910
child throughout the entire course of 
history,

944
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:53,130
which is approximately correct by the 
way.

945
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:57,090
Then imagine that half of the men had 
zero and the other half had to.

946
00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:01,200
Okay.
And that's roughly the case.

947
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:05,820
So half of males historically speaking,
have been reproductive disasters.

948
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:09,000
And the reason for that is because of 
female sexual subjectivity.

949
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:12,960
So it is actually the case that female 
humans are nature.

950
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:13,853
It's not only that they're,
that they're associated with nature 

951
00:46:16,201 --> 00:46:18,990
symbolically as far as rep production is
concerned.

952
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,710
They are the force of nature that does 
the selection.

953
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:25,140
And so their nature in the most 
fundamental way,

954
00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:29,400
and there is a chaotic element of that 
at least in relationship to men and also

955
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:33,000
in relationship to women.
Because a lot of the um,

956
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:36,300
female on female competition is 
competition.

957
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:39,930
That's chaotic for the right to be 
sexually selective,

958
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:42,450
right?
Not only with regards to men,

959
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:43,463
which drives a lot of politicking but 
also in relationship to each other 

960
00:46:46,111 --> 00:46:46,944
because part of what human females do,
his jockey for position in the female 

961
00:46:50,311 --> 00:46:53,700
dominance hierarchy for the top 
position,

962
00:46:53,701 --> 00:46:56,520
which is the woman who gets to be most 
sexually selective.

963
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:59,430
And so that drives female female 
competition.

964
00:46:59,431 --> 00:47:01,530
And it's a different dynamic.
There's,

965
00:47:01,590 --> 00:47:02,423
there's similarities between female 
female competition and male male 

966
00:47:04,921 --> 00:47:05,754
competition.
But there are also differences and 

967
00:47:07,051 --> 00:47:08,670
they're pronounced.
So men,

968
00:47:08,671 --> 00:47:10,110
for example,
are,

969
00:47:10,111 --> 00:47:11,560
well,
men are more likely to compete,

970
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:12,413
compete for socioeconomic status.
And that's partly because that drives 

971
00:47:15,391 --> 00:47:16,224
female mate choice.
So the correlation for men between 

972
00:47:18,361 --> 00:47:22,440
socioeconomic status and sexual success 
is about 0.6.

973
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:25,440
And for women it's zero,
zero,

974
00:47:25,441 --> 00:47:27,150
in fact,
it's actually slightly negative.

975
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:29,070
So,
and that's a huge difference.

976
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:30,213
Men and women.

977
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:32,050
But do you know that?
Do you know the anthropologists?

978
00:47:32,051 --> 00:47:33,610
Sarah Hrdy,
h,

979
00:47:33,611 --> 00:47:34,540
r,
d y,

980
00:47:34,590 --> 00:47:35,423
and,
and she's like my favorite feminist 

981
00:47:36,701 --> 00:47:37,534
theorist,
although she would say I'm a theorist 

982
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:44,460
who happens to be a feminist,
but she studied primate behavior and she

983
00:47:45,041 --> 00:47:46,930
watched,
she looked at the women very care.

984
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:50,980
They're the females in not with walking 
very carefully and looked at it,

985
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:53,640
uh,
chimpanzees and gazelles and,

986
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:55,640
and found that,
um,

987
00:47:56,410 --> 00:48:01,410
the female initially like male 
primatologist would look and say,

988
00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:03,550
oh,
the females,

989
00:48:04,030 --> 00:48:06,430
the males are dominant and the females 
are so cooperative.

990
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:07,353
She looked more carefully.
And so the females weren't exactly 

991
00:48:09,881 --> 00:48:10,714
cooperative.
Like they would pass around their 

992
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:14,020
infants,
their baby,

993
00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:17,550
you know,
whatever they were and would find it.

994
00:48:17,551 --> 00:48:20,140
And so the male primatology will say,
oh,

995
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:22,120
they're,
they're so kind.

996
00:48:22,121 --> 00:48:25,300
And caring.
She found out that when it was not your,

997
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:27,003
it was not hers,
they would take like little tufts of 

998
00:48:28,691 --> 00:48:29,310
hair,
you know,

999
00:48:29,310 --> 00:48:31,470
it would come out or they do something 
to the eyes,

1000
00:48:31,471 --> 00:48:35,620
you and the baby would like be injured 
and she saw all this violence.

1001
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:38,100
That would be true in her status.
Differentiation.

1002
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:39,053
Yes.
It's much more likely that it'll happen 

1003
00:48:40,141 --> 00:48:42,930
when a higher status female is taking 
care of lower status infant.

1004
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:45,490
Exactly.
And she said the great tragedy,

1005
00:48:45,970 --> 00:48:46,803
well not tragedy,
she had the reality of our species and 

1006
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:53,260
in fact the subtitle for the book is 
that the woman who never evolved,

1007
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:57,010
we didn't evolve for niceness and 
cooperative.

1008
00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:02,220
There's immense competition and we can,
according to her,

1009
00:49:02,770 --> 00:49:03,603
we are,
it's indelibly marked in our nature to 

1010
00:49:07,031 --> 00:49:11,830
compete for the dominant males and no 
doubt about that.

1011
00:49:11,870 --> 00:49:12,820
There's so,

1012
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:15,100
and that seems to cross culturally as 
well.

1013
00:49:15,101 --> 00:49:16,920
That does flatten out a little bit in 
the morning,

1014
00:49:16,921 --> 00:49:18,130
Gail,
the tarion societies.

1015
00:49:18,350 --> 00:49:19,990
Yeah.
So instead of being exaggerated,

1016
00:49:19,991 --> 00:49:21,460
it does flatten to some degree.
Right?

1017
00:49:21,461 --> 00:49:22,294
So you could imagine that there's a 
biological component and the cultural 

1018
00:49:25,001 --> 00:49:26,970
component of course,
both in,

1019
00:49:26,971 --> 00:49:28,300
in,
in that case,

1020
00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:33,280
if you modify the cultural component 
then that seems to decrease the overall.

1021
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:35,600
So like,
let me meet,

1022
00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:36,443
be more clear about this.
Women are less prone to mate up across 

1023
00:49:41,201 --> 00:49:42,034
an up status hierarchies in Scandinavia 
than they are in lessie Galitary and 

1024
00:49:44,911 --> 00:49:46,990
countries.
But there are still prone to do it.

1025
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:49,630
So worldwide for example,
women,

1026
00:49:49,631 --> 00:49:50,464
young women find men who are about four 
years older than them maximumly 

1027
00:49:53,051 --> 00:49:57,160
attractive and they tend to mate across 
and up status hierarchies.

1028
00:49:57,161 --> 00:49:59,410
And so one of the consequences of that,
for example,

1029
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:03,010
is that as women have entered the 
workforce,

1030
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:03,963
they've have actually driven in equality
because rich women will only marry rich 

1031
00:50:08,771 --> 00:50:11,140
men.
Men rich as them or Richard.

1032
00:50:11,141 --> 00:50:14,230
Whereas rich men will marry women who 
are poor than them,

1033
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:15,573
but women won't.
And so what that means is it's another 

1034
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:21,070
factor that's pooling wealth in the 
hands of fewer and fewer people.

1035
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:22,143
This is all its assorted of mating know 
and you just find someone with your 

1036
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:25,473
background here.
Whereas the doctor might have married 

1037
00:50:27,771 --> 00:50:28,440
his secretary.

1038
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,060
You now marries another doctor.
Yep.

1039
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,073
Well,
can I ask then stepping a little bit 

1040
00:50:32,661 --> 00:50:35,310
back from primates as well,
how does this um,

1041
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:38,570
selection work in the era of swiping 
right

1042
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:39,643
and unless

1043
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:41,533
how,
what is your reaction to the way young 

1044
00:50:44,391 --> 00:50:44,990
people did

1045
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:45,571
today?
Oh,

1046
00:50:45,571 --> 00:50:47,870
that's a good,
I was really hoping we'd get into that.

1047
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:48,773
I was really,
you were very into the monkey so I 

1048
00:50:50,481 --> 00:50:51,600
didn't want to interrupt.
No.

1049
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,800
Well I should close off to Scandinavia

1050
00:50:54,870 --> 00:50:55,703
discussion just by pointing out,
and this is something that the 

1051
00:50:57,511 --> 00:50:59,430
scandinavians are already going to have 
to wrestle with,

1052
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:00,264
is that if you institute effective 
policies to promote equality of 

1053
00:51:04,891 --> 00:51:07,560
opportunity,
which the Scandinavians have done,

1054
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:09,293
you're going to produce some equality.
So like a 50 50 distribution of men and 

1055
00:51:12,301 --> 00:51:13,134
women in the workplace,
but you're also going to exacerbate 

1056
00:51:15,511 --> 00:51:19,170
certain kinds of inequality and you 
can't get out of that.

1057
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:20,063
So you cannot have equality of 
opportunity and equality of outcome 

1058
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,810
together.
They don't work together.

1059
00:51:24,811 --> 00:51:25,644
And equality of outcome,
the essentially quality of outcome 

1060
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:28,133
doctrine,
which is often described with the code 

1061
00:51:30,161 --> 00:51:30,994
word equity,
is that at every level of every 

1062
00:51:33,181 --> 00:51:37,200
occupation,
the people have to be represented by the

1063
00:51:37,201 --> 00:51:39,930
same number that they're represented in 
at the population.

1064
00:51:40,170 --> 00:51:44,340
So if it's not 50 50 men and women at 
each in each occupation I need,

1065
00:51:44,430 --> 00:51:45,263
and in each strata at each occupation,
then that sort of prime of Fossi 

1066
00:51:48,301 --> 00:51:52,410
evidence for discrimination and for 
systemic discrimination,

1067
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:53,670
it's like,
no,

1068
00:51:53,730 --> 00:51:55,770
sorry,
you have to factor in choice.

1069
00:51:55,771 --> 00:51:58,650
And choice actually turns out to be a 
very important determinant.

1070
00:51:58,830 --> 00:52:01,140
And as the society gets flatter and 
flatter,

1071
00:52:01,470 --> 00:52:04,560
choice becomes a more important and more
and more important determinant.

1072
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:05,693
And so you,
so what that essentially means is that 

1073
00:52:08,101 --> 00:52:08,934
the most radical end of the left wing 
political agenda is logically 

1074
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,680
impossible.
Apart from the fact that it's impossible

1075
00:52:16,681 --> 00:52:17,820
for a variety of other reasons.

1076
00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:19,800
And they should look at the data.
I mean it,

1077
00:52:20,590 --> 00:52:25,590
it's just a cliche now of in any group 
of activists and they'll say,

1078
00:52:26,681 --> 00:52:27,514
oh well we need to,
in order for women to achieve the 

1079
00:52:30,071 --> 00:52:33,760
quality,
we need government funded daycare and we

1080
00:52:33,761 --> 00:52:35,680
need,
they have it in Sweden.

1081
00:52:36,370 --> 00:52:41,370
Sweden has fewer women in managerial 
levels in American women are ahead.

1082
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:43,083
In fact now they have jen,
oh they have quotas over there so they 

1083
00:52:45,131 --> 00:52:45,964
need a female ceos and females on boards
and made any differences in bringing in 

1084
00:52:49,691 --> 00:52:52,750
member American women because we're so 
much further ahead.

1085
00:52:52,830 --> 00:52:53,370
Yeah.

1086
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:54,203
It's called no difference in the 
distribution of men and women lower in 

1087
00:52:56,311 --> 00:52:57,144
the herd.
It's called the Nordic paradox and say 

1088
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:01,400
you guys are so wonky.
I want to get back.

1089
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:04,390
Okay.
You all want to get back to,

1090
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:08,290
I want to get back to those monkeys.
Well thinking

1091
00:53:08,350 --> 00:53:09,183
this morning about,
I was talking to a variety of political 

1092
00:53:11,801 --> 00:53:14,440
types and we were talking about this 
morning.

1093
00:53:14,470 --> 00:53:16,500
Yeah.
In DC and hard to believe.

1094
00:53:16,501 --> 00:53:17,770
Hard to believe.
No I'm not.

1095
00:53:17,771 --> 00:53:18,604
I'm not telling you.
Okay.

1096
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:19,473
Bunch of Republicans here.
And I've been talking to Democrats as 

1097
00:53:21,701 --> 00:53:23,560
well,
but it was mostly Republicans here.

1098
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:27,240
And we were talking about abortion and 
um,

1099
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:28,553
I made a case that that's really not a 
very productive discussion because 

1100
00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:38,390
you're talking about a problem way too 
late in the sequence of problems.

1101
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:40,910
So,
um,

1102
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:43,980
by the time the discussion starts to be 
about abortion,

1103
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:47,400
there's 50 problems that have already 
emerged that no one has addressed.

1104
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:48,623
And some of those problems are the 
fundamental problem is how human beings 

1105
00:53:51,421 --> 00:53:54,720
should regulate their sexual behavior.
And that's a big problem.

1106
00:53:54,721 --> 00:53:55,554
And you think,
well,

1107
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,130
there's an interesting thing that's 
happening because you know,

1108
00:53:59,131 --> 00:54:01,140
the people on the right would say,
well,

1109
00:54:01,141 --> 00:54:01,710
that's easy.

1110
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:02,543
It's like don't sleep around and,
and get married and have sex with your 

1111
00:54:05,701 --> 00:54:07,560
marital partner and that solve the 
problem.

1112
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:11,430
So there's strictures on sexual behavior
and those would be the traditional ones.

1113
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:16,940
And what you see on the left is that 
there's this weird paradoxical demand,

1114
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:19,410
let's say,
um,

1115
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:21,173
that people should be allowed to express
their sexuality in any manner that they 

1116
00:54:24,271 --> 00:54:29,271
choose whenever they want,
but that sex is so dangerous that it has

1117
00:54:31,381 --> 00:54:35,490
to be carefully regulated at every 
single stage of the interaction.

1118
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:36,480
And so,
you know,

1119
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:37,313
that many state legislatures have now 
followed the example of university 

1120
00:54:41,551 --> 00:54:42,384
campuses and put it in affirmative 
consent legislation so that every move 

1121
00:54:46,201 --> 00:54:47,034
you make towards physical intimacy has 
to be proceeded by the instantiation of 

1122
00:54:52,201 --> 00:54:54,060
a verbal contract.
Essentially.

1123
00:54:54,061 --> 00:54:54,611
It's like,
well,

1124
00:54:54,611 --> 00:54:57,660
can I take your hand?
Yes,

1125
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:59,490
you actually hit,
from what I understand,

1126
00:54:59,491 --> 00:55:03,240
you actually have to say yes,
like nodding is not sufficient.

1127
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:06,270
And so,
and so each stage has to be,

1128
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:10,140
has to be proceeded by affirmative 
consent and uh,

1129
00:55:11,370 --> 00:55:12,240
you know,
which,

1130
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:13,920
which,
well,

1131
00:55:13,921 --> 00:55:15,330
I won't,
I won't say anything about,

1132
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:15,931
yeah,
I will.

1133
00:55:15,931 --> 00:55:16,764
It's absurd.
It's absurd to assume that that's how 

1134
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:23,370
human intimate relationships are 
supposed to proceed.

1135
00:55:23,850 --> 00:55:27,900
And then you have complicated laws 
emerging that are part of that,

1136
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:29,700
that,
for example,

1137
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:32,130
this is the case in California as I 
understand it,

1138
00:55:32,131 --> 00:55:35,430
is that you cannot give affirmative 
consent if you're intoxicated.

1139
00:55:36,390 --> 00:55:37,560
Okay.
So you think about that,

1140
00:55:37,561 --> 00:55:38,850
it's like,
well what does that mean?

1141
00:55:38,870 --> 00:55:43,770
It means that like a lot of sex is 
illegal.

1142
00:55:43,771 --> 00:55:46,980
Been illegal for a long time,
including marital,

1143
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:47,761
marital,
yes.

1144
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:50,370
That's the one that's next to me on my 
honeymoon.

1145
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:52,580
Okay,
well that is thinking it,

1146
00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:53,640
it's,
it seems,

1147
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,020
it seems to me,
it seems to mean,

1148
00:55:56,021 --> 00:55:56,580
and I'm,
I'm,

1149
00:55:56,580 --> 00:55:57,690
I'm not,
no,

1150
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:00,480
I'm,
it seems to me,

1151
00:56:00,481 --> 00:56:01,314
to me in the California legislation that
if you have sex with your wife or 

1152
00:56:04,051 --> 00:56:07,530
husband and either of you is 
intoxicated,

1153
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:11,700
then you're either one of you or both is
guilty of rape.

1154
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:14,100
That's what it looks like to me.
Actually,

1155
00:56:14,101 --> 00:56:14,934
I was in a debate a few years ago at the
University of Virginia Law School and I 

1156
00:56:18,631 --> 00:56:23,631
turned to my debate partner in his head.
So if what you're saying is right,

1157
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:27,310
um,
two people can rate one another,

1158
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:30,010
right?
She said yes.

1159
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:31,960
And I thought,
Oh shit.

1160
00:56:34,830 --> 00:56:35,980
I mean,
how can that be?

1161
00:56:36,610 --> 00:56:37,480
That's the question.

1162
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:38,200
Well,
okay,

1163
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:39,033
so then I would say,
well it's interesting because I think 

1164
00:56:41,741 --> 00:56:42,574
that a lot of this confusion has emerged
fundamentally as a consequence of the 

1165
00:56:45,611 --> 00:56:47,710
birth control pill.
So you know,

1166
00:56:47,711 --> 00:56:48,544
cause you got to think situationally 
before you think it theologically or 

1167
00:56:50,771 --> 00:56:51,604
psychologically it's like,
it seems to me that the 20th century 

1168
00:56:55,091 --> 00:56:57,670
will be remembered for the hydrogen 
bomb,

1169
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:00,520
the transistor and the birth control 
pill.

1170
00:57:01,030 --> 00:57:01,863
And those are unbelievably radical 
technological innovations and maybe the 

1171
00:57:05,261 --> 00:57:06,094
most,

1172
00:57:06,570 --> 00:57:11,570
yeah,
but that's dependent on the transistor,

1173
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:13,800
you know,
cause it spawned off with that.

1174
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:14,690
So that,
that's

1175
00:57:14,990 --> 00:57:17,030
technological innovation that spawned 
all that.

1176
00:57:17,390 --> 00:57:18,980
Of the three,
I would say the,

1177
00:57:19,190 --> 00:57:22,160
the birth control pill is probably the 
bigger hydrogen bomb.

1178
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:24,230
So,
and because it,

1179
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:25,153
it changed the fundamental biological 
nature of women and men and because it 

1180
00:57:31,191 --> 00:57:34,730
gave women for the first time in 
biological history,

1181
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:38,780
the,
the option of choosing their,

1182
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:41,280
the status.
And that's,

1183
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:43,230
that's abs.
Well,

1184
00:57:43,231 --> 00:57:44,460
yes and no.
Like,

1185
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:45,660
yes,
we like it,

1186
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:48,050
but it,
it's not something that's come without a

1187
00:57:48,210 --> 00:57:53,130
tremendous w h it's come with your mind,
complexity.

1188
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:55,620
A fellow can anything reading?
No,

1189
00:57:55,650 --> 00:57:57,890
no,
I haven't that,

1190
00:57:58,930 --> 00:58:00,620
well I'm not,
I'm not making it in your

1191
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:01,453
case for the abolition of the birth 
control pill by any stretch of the 

1192
00:58:03,591 --> 00:58:06,020
imagination,
but I'm pointing at its complexity.

1193
00:58:06,021 --> 00:58:09,040
And so because one of the questions is,
well,

1194
00:58:09,050 --> 00:58:11,210
once you can regulate your reproductive 
function,

1195
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:14,630
what attitude should you have towards 
sex?

1196
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:20,560
And one answer might be the more of it 
under the more varied circumstances,

1197
00:58:20,661 --> 00:58:21,494
the better because why not?
And I would say that was actually part 

1198
00:58:25,131 --> 00:58:25,964
of the attitude that emerged in the 
aftermath of the birth control pill in 

1199
00:58:28,491 --> 00:58:29,810
the 1960s.
Right.

1200
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:30,793
And it was,
it was a reasonable response in some 

1201
00:58:33,291 --> 00:58:34,124
sense because it's such a cataclysmic 
change that you don't know what it 

1202
00:58:36,381 --> 00:58:38,090
implies.
Well,

1203
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:40,760
what's the consequence of that?
Well,

1204
00:58:40,970 --> 00:58:41,803
first of all,
people aren't reliable enough to use 

1205
00:58:44,241 --> 00:58:46,610
birth control in an entirely reliable 
manner.

1206
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:50,270
So even though it can work at near 100% 
efficiency,

1207
00:58:50,271 --> 00:58:51,104
you have to take it extraordinarily 
regularly and in a disciplined manner 

1208
00:58:53,511 --> 00:58:54,380
for that to work.

1209
00:58:54,710 --> 00:58:56,520
And so,
um,

1210
00:58:56,870 --> 00:58:59,390
there was still the problem of unwanted 
pregnancy,

1211
00:58:59,391 --> 00:59:00,224
let's say.
And then there was the problem of the 

1212
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:06,940
proliferation of sexual epidemics and 
that culminated in aids,

1213
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:07,670
which,
you know,

1214
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:09,830
could have easily wiped all of us out 
but didn't.

1215
00:59:09,950 --> 00:59:12,680
But there's other sexual epidemics that 
could have had the same effect.

1216
00:59:12,681 --> 00:59:13,514
But we've,
we've been fortunate enough to escape 

1217
00:59:15,111 --> 00:59:16,280
them.
And,

1218
00:59:16,610 --> 00:59:20,390
and then,
and then more recently there's been this

1219
00:59:21,050 --> 00:59:21,883
weird inversion,
especially on the radical left that 

1220
00:59:26,691 --> 00:59:30,530
points to the reemergence of something 
like a set of sexual taboos.

1221
00:59:30,890 --> 00:59:31,311
You know,
like,

1222
00:59:31,311 --> 00:59:36,311
I think the idea that sex is casual and 
that it's a form of entertainment is,

1223
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:40,430
I think it's an absolutely preposterous 
idea.

1224
00:59:40,790 --> 00:59:41,623
I think that it's psychologically 
shallow beyond belief to hold that as a 

1225
00:59:47,631 --> 00:59:49,220
core,
uh,

1226
00:59:49,310 --> 00:59:52,220
proposition.
Because it forces you to,

1227
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:53,600
first of all,
if,

1228
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:54,463
if,
if it's repetitive sex with multiple 

1229
00:59:55,881 --> 00:59:56,714
partners,
it,

1230
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:00,560
it forces you to treat people as if 
they're interchangeable.

1231
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:01,813
And I don't see how that's good for you 
psychologically or for the people that 

1232
01:00:04,911 --> 01:00:07,270
you're using interchangeably.
Um,

1233
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:08,413
it,
it implies that you can divorce 

1234
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:15,550
sexuality from play,
from the desire for more,

1235
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:18,560
for a relationship,
from emotional fragility,

1236
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:21,380
from love,
from family,

1237
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:22,273
from responsibility.
All of those things that are part and 

1238
01:00:24,201 --> 01:00:26,360
parcel of every one.
And I don't think you can,

1239
01:00:26,361 --> 01:00:29,360
and I don't think people's experience 
indicates that you can,

1240
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:30,793
and especially on the emotional front.
And I think that's partly what's 

1241
01:00:34,851 --> 01:00:37,970
driving.
And there was also a residual sense that

1242
01:00:37,971 --> 01:00:38,804
there's something about sex that's 
fundamentally dangerous and maybe it's 

1243
01:00:41,211 --> 01:00:42,044
dangerous emotionally and personally and
maybe it's dangerous socially and 

1244
01:00:45,291 --> 01:00:46,124
psychologically,
which most certainly is because it's a 

1245
01:00:47,901 --> 01:00:51,260
powerful force.
And the way the left is reacting to that

1246
01:00:51,590 --> 01:00:56,270
is by insisting that all forms of sexual
behavior are valid and,

1247
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:59,090
and,
and that it's reasonable to manifest all

1248
01:00:59,091 --> 01:00:59,924
of them,
but that it's simultaneously so 

1249
01:01:01,401 --> 01:01:02,234
dangerous that absolutely every aspect 
of it has to be state regulated and in 

1250
01:01:05,571 --> 01:01:06,404
an increasingly draconian form.
And so I think what needs to happen is 

1251
01:01:09,951 --> 01:01:12,950
that the left and the right have to get 
together and have a,

1252
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:16,820
like a real discussion about what 
constitutes felid sexual morality.

1253
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:20,690
And that's the conversation you have to 
have way before you worry about solving.

1254
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:22,850
Like the abortion debate,
which you know,

1255
01:01:22,851 --> 01:01:25,640
is very divisive and very,
and very intractable.

1256
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:26,513
Well,
one of the things we talked about 

1257
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:28,253
actually just last week on the podcast,
does this cover story in the Atlantic 

1258
01:01:30,811 --> 01:01:31,644
about the sexual recession among young 
people that despite the advent of the 

1259
01:01:35,851 --> 01:01:37,350
birth control pill,
abortion is,

1260
01:01:37,390 --> 01:01:39,360
is going down.
Um,

1261
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:41,280
uh,
there's a,

1262
01:01:41,281 --> 01:01:44,050
there's lexus,
there's blessing is going down.

1263
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:48,120
Okay.
And what have you looked into that worry

1264
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:49,050
about opinion on that?

1265
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:51,330
Well,
if you raise the cost of something,

1266
01:01:51,331 --> 01:01:53,340
you'd decrease its prevalence.
You know,

1267
01:01:53,341 --> 01:01:54,750
and,
and I think that it's,

1268
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:57,090
it seems to be,
you know,

1269
01:01:57,140 --> 01:01:58,770
dangerous nowadays.
Well,

1270
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:00,993
I kind of think that it's also a 
reflection of the same thing that 

1271
01:02:03,151 --> 01:02:05,400
Bloomberg reported on just a few days 
ago.

1272
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:09,150
He said that across businesses,
men are thinking,

1273
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:11,940
I'm not spending any time with a single 
woman that isn't,

1274
01:02:12,050 --> 01:02:14,550
you know,
associated with me in some formal manner

1275
01:02:14,551 --> 01:02:16,170
like my wife,
I'm not going to do it.

1276
01:02:16,171 --> 01:02:18,780
I'm not going to mentor young women.
I'm not going to be in a room alone with

1277
01:02:18,781 --> 01:02:20,100
them.
I know I couldn't face career

1278
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:22,260
annihilation.
And instantly they,

1279
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:23,070
they're frightened of

1280
01:02:23,070 --> 01:02:24,300
the young women.
Now that was kate.

1281
01:02:24,301 --> 01:02:27,450
Julian said that's part of it.
But we can overexaggerate the part,

1282
01:02:27,451 --> 01:02:28,284
I mean,
anxiety and depression is going up 

1283
01:02:29,491 --> 01:02:30,870
amongst,
uh,

1284
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:34,410
both young men and young women.
A suicide is going up,

1285
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:35,591
um,
that,

1286
01:02:35,591 --> 01:02:38,310
that there's,
it's not just a,

1287
01:02:39,210 --> 01:02:41,280
you know,
most people I think are not,

1288
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:42,233
we're talking about an elite demographic
who is into the consent and political 

1289
01:02:45,601 --> 01:02:46,434
correctness and work with the,
this is across the board and it's 

1290
01:02:49,771 --> 01:02:50,920
global.
Um,

1291
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,830
it's in,
it's happening even in Sweden,

1292
01:02:53,570 --> 01:02:55,920
it's really happening in Japan and 
Japan.

1293
01:02:56,150 --> 01:02:56,990
Exactly.
So,

1294
01:02:56,991 --> 01:02:59,410
so,
and that speaks to,

1295
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:01,130
and especially in Japan,
they have,

1296
01:03:01,150 --> 01:03:01,440
yeah.

1297
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:02,273
People,
especially young men have given up on 

1298
01:03:04,891 --> 01:03:08,550
intimacy and having sex is actually,
I mean,

1299
01:03:08,610 --> 01:03:10,620
that had too much trouble.
Sex robots.

1300
01:03:10,710 --> 01:03:11,540
Right.
Well,

1301
01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:12,151
right,
right,

1302
01:03:12,151 --> 01:03:12,560
right.
Well,

1303
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:13,530
hello question.
Well,

1304
01:03:13,531 --> 01:03:14,460
and there's pornography.

1305
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:15,880
Yeah.
There's pornography,

1306
01:03:16,150 --> 01:03:19,220
basically zero risks when you allow for 
pornography.

1307
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:19,980
Three the,
that,

1308
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:23,900
that the men and women will sort of 
separate that from their actual cyclic.

1309
01:03:23,910 --> 01:03:26,620
Like maybe we were seeing a whole,
I guess,

1310
01:03:26,621 --> 01:03:28,830
collapse of intimacy.
Hmm.

1311
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:30,680
Let alone sex.
And,

1312
01:03:30,681 --> 01:03:31,251
and,
and,

1313
01:03:31,251 --> 01:03:32,084
and,
and I don't think that's just explained 

1314
01:03:33,071 --> 01:03:35,710
by the political nature.
Um,

1315
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:38,830
so I'd be interested in your thoughts.

1316
01:03:39,290 --> 01:03:39,711
Yeah.
Well,

1317
01:03:39,711 --> 01:03:40,544
I don't know that,
I don't know the literature on the 

1318
01:03:42,351 --> 01:03:46,040
decline in sexual activity well enough 
to know if it's valid or reliable.

1319
01:03:46,820 --> 01:03:48,950
But I mean,
I think that,

1320
01:03:49,250 --> 01:03:50,083
you know,
in a stable society you take lots of 

1321
01:03:51,591 --> 01:03:53,060
things for granted.
You take,

1322
01:03:53,150 --> 01:03:53,983
you take the fact that men and women are
going to be sexually attracted to one 

1323
01:03:56,781 --> 01:03:57,614
another for granted.
And even though it's more fragile than 

1324
01:03:59,991 --> 01:04:01,490
it appears.
No.

1325
01:04:01,810 --> 01:04:04,370
And it's suppressed more easily than you
might think.

1326
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:07,820
Um,
and you take the idea that men and women

1327
01:04:07,830 --> 01:04:08,663
are going to move together towards the 
establishment of longterm intimate 

1328
01:04:11,481 --> 01:04:12,314
relationships for granted.
But that's partly because you don't 

1329
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:19,720
understand what invisible preconditions 
exist to make that self evident,

1330
01:04:21,150 --> 01:04:21,983
you know?
And when those invisible preconditions 

1331
01:04:24,261 --> 01:04:27,980
are disrupted by rapid technological or 
sociological change,

1332
01:04:27,981 --> 01:04:30,320
then things shift underneath you when 
you don't know why.

1333
01:04:31,350 --> 01:04:34,000
A lot of it is traced to the advent of 
the smartphone,

1334
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:38,590
especially in the generation z that,
that kate was explaining this to us,

1335
01:04:38,591 --> 01:04:39,424
that you could see it was broadband 
internet and the smartphone that led to 

1336
01:04:43,451 --> 01:04:44,490
this.
You know,

1337
01:04:44,530 --> 01:04:45,363
increasing fall off of relationships.
Maybe the abstract is more interesting 

1338
01:04:50,351 --> 01:04:51,260
than right proximal.

1339
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:54,570
Well you see that I just want to,
I want to know the truth.

1340
01:04:54,571 --> 01:04:56,670
Have you ever been with somebody who 
would have loved,

1341
01:04:56,671 --> 01:04:57,960
if I'm fascinated and all that,
but

1342
01:04:58,430 --> 01:04:59,990
you really wanted to get back to your 
smartphone.

1343
01:05:00,050 --> 01:05:01,610
Has that ever happened?
Yeah.

1344
01:05:01,611 --> 01:05:02,840
Well it happens all the time.

1345
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:09,960
No Tab is during our podcast.
I tell you to put your phones.

1346
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:11,593
I know I'm climbing.
I'm researching for the printers of the 

1347
01:05:13,831 --> 01:05:14,910
pot.
Very addictive,

1348
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:16,710
very addictive.
You know,

1349
01:05:16,711 --> 01:05:17,890
I read the other day that

1350
01:05:18,270 --> 01:05:19,820
um,
they're very laurie,

1351
01:05:20,230 --> 01:05:21,063
they are kind of going together.
The preferred method of interpersonal 

1352
01:05:24,971 --> 01:05:25,804
communication between young people know 
is texting rather than face to face 

1353
01:05:28,181 --> 01:05:29,130
communication.
Right.

1354
01:05:29,170 --> 01:05:31,560
And the swiping the apes.
That's,

1355
01:05:31,561 --> 01:05:32,410
that's,
that's,

1356
01:05:32,411 --> 01:05:35,140
that's a very interesting topic to the,
the uh,

1357
01:05:35,170 --> 01:05:36,850
like the tinder phenomenon.
That's right.

1358
01:05:37,010 --> 01:05:40,170
Cause that that's an also right.
Major technological revolution.

1359
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:45,200
Because what it's done,
I would say for the first time is reduce

1360
01:05:46,530 --> 01:05:49,800
the cost of rejection.
Two males,

1361
01:05:49,830 --> 01:05:52,710
two zero,
because it hides it.

1362
01:05:53,190 --> 01:05:54,023
You're the only people you ever hear 
from our people who haven't rejected 

1363
01:05:55,551 --> 01:05:56,181
you,
although,

1364
01:05:56,181 --> 01:05:57,330
although they,
true.

1365
01:05:57,340 --> 01:05:58,173
But,
but there was one man who had to make 

1366
01:06:00,110 --> 01:06:02,680
300 he key actually tallied it.
Yeah.

1367
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:07,440
You have to make 300 requests of swiping
right or whatever one replies.

1368
01:06:07,441 --> 01:06:09,440
So I think he had the sense of,
sure,

1369
01:06:09,441 --> 01:06:10,041
sure,
sure.

1370
01:06:10,041 --> 01:06:13,150
But it's massively attenuated and 
observer.

1371
01:06:13,190 --> 01:06:15,080
You're not being humiliated.
Not at all.

1372
01:06:15,230 --> 01:06:16,250
Not at all.
It's really,

1373
01:06:16,251 --> 01:06:18,230
it's really at arm's length and you 
know,

1374
01:06:18,231 --> 01:06:20,990
you can swipe very,
very rapidly and so you can get all that

1375
01:06:20,991 --> 01:06:23,000
rejection over within a very short 
period of time.

1376
01:06:23,001 --> 01:06:26,780
It's like losing a video.
Gamers or well last be worse.

1377
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:28,790
I mean not nearly as bad.
Yeah.

1378
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:30,490
So,
and you know,

1379
01:06:30,491 --> 01:06:31,080
I,
I,

1380
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:32,710
I don't know what,
I mean,

1381
01:06:32,711 --> 01:06:36,160
tinder also reduces the,
one of the other things that,

1382
01:06:36,250 --> 01:06:38,350
things that you want to think about with
regards to sex,

1383
01:06:38,351 --> 01:06:40,870
and I think this is probably 
particularly true for women,

1384
01:06:40,871 --> 01:06:41,704
is that to what degree is it in women's 
interests to allow the cost of sex to 

1385
01:06:45,701 --> 01:06:46,534
fall to zero?
Because with pornography certainly does 

1386
01:06:49,541 --> 01:06:50,374
that.
And it just seems to me that that's not 

1387
01:06:51,911 --> 01:06:52,744
a very good long term strategy for 
relationships between men and women 

1388
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:59,470
because whatever sex is worth,
the cost of zero is the wrong price,

1389
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:01,760
and so that's,
you know,

1390
01:07:02,010 --> 01:07:02,843
oh,
you heard of the bunny ranch and pay 

1391
01:07:03,441 --> 01:07:04,340
quite a bit for it.

1392
01:07:04,370 --> 01:07:05,450
Well true,
true.

1393
01:07:05,990 --> 01:07:06,970
That's true.
But you,

1394
01:07:06,980 --> 01:07:08,170
you know,
you don't have to,

1395
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:09,200
no.
You know,

1396
01:07:09,201 --> 01:07:10,034
I've heard from a number of women what 
written read blog reports on their 

1397
01:07:13,971 --> 01:07:18,971
frustration with their attempts to be 
relatively sexually selective.

1398
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:20,353
Like let's say they decide that they're 
not going to sleep with their new 

1399
01:07:23,991 --> 01:07:26,690
partner on the first date.
You know,

1400
01:07:27,050 --> 01:07:27,883
they're frustrated by the fact that to 
the degree that they're being cautious 

1401
01:07:31,011 --> 01:07:31,844
in their sexual behavior,
which I think is actually an admirable 

1402
01:07:35,570 --> 01:07:38,990
idea,
that they're instantly out competed,

1403
01:07:39,020 --> 01:07:42,590
especially if their partners are 
somewhat impulsive by women who will say

1404
01:07:42,591 --> 01:07:45,680
yes at the drop of a hat.
And so,

1405
01:07:46,340 --> 01:07:47,180
well,
again,

1406
01:07:47,210 --> 01:07:49,850
I don't think you know what depends on 
what the goal is.

1407
01:07:50,030 --> 01:07:53,120
That's the thing is that there's the 
short terms,

1408
01:07:53,180 --> 01:07:54,013
there's short term sexual gratification,
but the literature indicates that 

1409
01:07:56,570 --> 01:07:58,040
married couples,
for example,

1410
01:07:58,130 --> 01:08:01,970
or couples in a permanent long term,
monogamous relationship or more sexually

1411
01:08:01,971 --> 01:08:02,804
satisfied than single people,
and maybe the single people have to be 

1412
01:08:05,391 --> 01:08:09,140
parsed out into those who were sexually 
successful and those who aren't.

1413
01:08:09,410 --> 01:08:12,710
But I suspect that wouldn't make that 
much difference.

1414
01:08:12,830 --> 01:08:13,663
But whatever.
There's utility of relatively immediate 

1415
01:08:17,391 --> 01:08:18,224
sexual gratification for whatever that's
worth and the adventurousness that goes 

1416
01:08:20,901 --> 01:08:24,350
along with that.
Let's say the hunt and the excitement of

1417
01:08:24,351 --> 01:08:25,184
having a new partner and all of that,
and maybe even the danger that's 

1418
01:08:27,381 --> 01:08:28,214
associated with that because people like
to have a little bit of danger in their 

1419
01:08:30,681 --> 01:08:33,140
life.
But what's the goal?

1420
01:08:33,170 --> 01:08:36,980
It's like what do people want?
And I mean there's a great book called a

1421
01:08:36,981 --> 01:08:40,040
billion wicked thoughts that was written
by Google engineers.

1422
01:08:40,041 --> 01:08:40,874
And so it contains great psychology 
because Google engineers don't care 

1423
01:08:43,551 --> 01:08:46,220
about political correctness and they 
just write down what they find.

1424
01:08:46,310 --> 01:08:48,620
They don't even notice that it's 
politically incorrect.

1425
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:49,633
Hence James Demora for example.
And what they found was that women use 

1426
01:08:54,081 --> 01:08:54,914
pornography just as much as men,
but the pornography that women use is 

1427
01:08:58,010 --> 01:08:58,843
verbal.

1428
01:08:59,000 --> 01:08:59,833
It's not even just stick.
And the pornographic novels essentially 

1429
01:09:04,130 --> 01:09:04,963
follow the same extraordinarily standard
plot line to the degree that publishing 

1430
01:09:09,111 --> 01:09:11,640
houses like Harlequin,
which was going to say it's the,

1431
01:09:11,670 --> 01:09:13,940
it's the bodice rippers that's right.
Right.

1432
01:09:13,950 --> 01:09:15,950
So in the Harlequin series,
you have,

1433
01:09:15,980 --> 01:09:17,630
you know,
the ones that were published like in the

1434
01:09:17,631 --> 01:09:19,760
1970s,
that are pretty tame.

1435
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,060
There's a small,
big,

1436
01:09:21,061 --> 01:09:22,400
or they're pretty hot actually.
Well,

1437
01:09:23,060 --> 01:09:25,250
there's a variety.
They range from,

1438
01:09:25,340 --> 01:09:26,173
they range from rep,
weebly team to essentially to hardcore 

1439
01:09:28,311 --> 01:09:29,360
pornography.
But the,

1440
01:09:29,660 --> 01:09:30,350
but,
uh,

1441
01:09:30,350 --> 01:09:32,450
the plots are quite similar and the plot
is,

1442
01:09:32,910 --> 01:09:33,743
um,
you know,

1443
01:09:33,770 --> 01:09:34,603
young,
relatively innocent woman finds 

1444
01:09:36,501 --> 01:09:37,940
powerful,
interesting,

1445
01:09:37,941 --> 01:09:42,380
dangerous male tames him and then they 
live happily ever after love.

1446
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:43,041
Yeah.
Yeah.

1447
01:09:43,041 --> 01:09:45,260
And it's the beauty and the beast plot,
which is a fundamental

1448
01:09:45,710 --> 01:09:47,440
fuck,
is search for women on porn hub.

1449
01:09:47,441 --> 01:09:49,930
We discovered,
we did an episode on Porn was,

1450
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:52,120
uh,
for women it was getting rape.

1451
01:09:52,270 --> 01:09:56,140
Wasn't that like the no lesbian aneurysm
or at least that was your port.

1452
01:09:56,170 --> 01:09:57,550
Yeah,
that was your search on me.

1453
01:09:57,610 --> 01:09:58,220
Oh,
okay.

1454
01:09:58,220 --> 01:09:59,020
I don't know.
I don't know.

1455
01:09:59,020 --> 01:10:01,900
I didn't like porn is going to the 
William Sonoma store.

1456
01:10:02,020 --> 01:10:04,980
I know it is.
It is female.

1457
01:10:05,030 --> 01:10:06,350
All those pumps.
Oh,

1458
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:07,193
the no longer philosopher,
Bill Maher one said that men and women 

1459
01:10:11,531 --> 01:10:12,364
should never tell one another their 
fantasies because when are outraged by 

1460
01:10:17,170 --> 01:10:19,960
what we say and we're totally bored by 
what they say.

1461
01:10:20,830 --> 01:10:24,070
And I thought like women have kind of 
these scenarios and you know,

1462
01:10:24,190 --> 01:10:26,020
I don't know Unicorns,
I don't know what they're doing.

1463
01:10:26,021 --> 01:10:28,600
Storylines,
storylines and men are just like,

1464
01:10:28,660 --> 01:10:31,210
uh,
I don't want to say this to you,

1465
01:10:31,211 --> 01:10:34,990
but there's a lot of just close ups of 
female body parts.

1466
01:10:35,290 --> 01:10:37,080
Yeah.
Well men are much more visually oriented

1467
01:10:37,470 --> 01:10:39,250
sexually and,
but now they're being shamed.

1468
01:10:39,251 --> 01:10:40,084
I mean,
now that it's called the male gaze and 

1469
01:10:42,191 --> 01:10:44,110
so there's all of this sick.
Oh my God.

1470
01:10:44,111 --> 01:10:47,720
The sports illustrated is exploiting the
female it.

1471
01:10:47,770 --> 01:10:50,410
Yeah.
Baby men like it.

1472
01:10:50,690 --> 01:10:51,281
And I,
I'm,

1473
01:10:51,281 --> 01:10:54,130
I'm worried that now sort of the way in 
the past,

1474
01:10:54,850 --> 01:10:56,170
um,
sexual sub,

1475
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:57,940
you know,
gays were shamed.

1476
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:01,480
We're now reversing it in shaming like 
heterosexual.

1477
01:11:01,540 --> 01:11:02,373
Yes.
That's definitely,

1478
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:05,830
remember we had the young woman who 
complained about being whistled at and I

1479
01:11:05,831 --> 01:11:06,461
said,
don't worry,

1480
01:11:06,461 --> 01:11:07,390
it stops.
Yeah.

1481
01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:09,373
Um,
do we have a little bit of time for a 

1482
01:11:10,511 --> 01:11:12,880
couple more topics with you?
Uh,

1483
01:11:12,930 --> 01:11:13,980
because one of the

1484
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:14,903
things that just coming out of this 
younger generation and you have a 

1485
01:11:16,741 --> 01:11:17,574
chapter of it in your book,
which I wanted to finish what the line 

1486
01:11:20,011 --> 01:11:23,460
that we were pursuing with sexual 
behavior.

1487
01:11:23,461 --> 01:11:24,294
The question is what's the end game?
And this is what people have to ask 

1488
01:11:27,031 --> 01:11:27,864
themselves is like one of the 
corollaries to the female pornographic 

1489
01:11:32,101 --> 01:11:35,730
romance is actually the establishment of
a longterm relationship.

1490
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:37,650
And the question is,
you know,

1491
01:11:37,651 --> 01:11:40,320
it's so funny cause I got pilloried in 
the New York Times,

1492
01:11:40,340 --> 01:11:41,540
um,
for,

1493
01:11:41,541 --> 01:11:42,374
for talking about enforced monogamy,
which is quite interesting because I 

1494
01:11:46,231 --> 01:11:46,820
talked to,
again,

1495
01:11:46,820 --> 01:11:50,130
that gets brought up like in every,
it's so ridiculous.

1496
01:11:50,131 --> 01:11:52,140
I talked to that woman for two,
two days.

1497
01:11:52,380 --> 01:11:54,330
I know.
It was just like a little side comment.

1498
01:11:54,331 --> 01:11:58,570
And then that became like the like,
like enforced monogamy.

1499
01:11:58,580 --> 01:12:00,240
You mean forced marriage or,
no,

1500
01:12:00,241 --> 01:12:01,074
I mean that was an anthropological term,
which she knew perfectly well because 

1501
01:12:04,201 --> 01:12:05,520
she's a very smart person.

1502
01:12:05,990 --> 01:12:06,823
Um,
and all it means is that there's a 

1503
01:12:07,831 --> 01:12:08,664
pronounced proclivity in human societies
around the world to enforce monogamous 

1504
01:12:13,321 --> 01:12:16,770
relationships at multiple levels of the 
sociological hierarchy.

1505
01:12:16,771 --> 01:12:20,520
You'd do it culturally do you do with an
expectation you do it illegally,

1506
01:12:20,850 --> 01:12:22,560
you know,
an enforced monogamy.

1507
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:26,370
So my son was just married and if he 
came to me next year and he said,

1508
01:12:26,371 --> 01:12:27,210
you know,
hey dad,

1509
01:12:27,211 --> 01:12:29,850
guess what,
I've managed to have four affairs in the

1510
01:12:29,850 --> 01:12:33,090
last year with hot women and my wife 
hasn't found out about any of them.

1511
01:12:33,180 --> 01:12:35,280
I'm not going to pat them on the back 
and say,

1512
01:12:35,281 --> 01:12:37,280
good job kid,
you know,

1513
01:12:37,290 --> 01:12:38,850
I'm going to say,
what the hell is up with you?

1514
01:12:38,851 --> 01:12:39,684
You know,
you violated the vow that you took your 

1515
01:12:41,131 --> 01:12:42,660
putting your whole future,
riskier,

1516
01:12:42,661 --> 01:12:46,140
betraying yourself and your wife.
Well that's enforced monogamy.

1517
01:12:46,141 --> 01:12:46,591
You know,
the,

1518
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:47,424
uh,
the idea is that the social norm is the 

1519
01:12:49,501 --> 01:12:50,334
establishment of a long term monogamous 
relationship and that there are 

1520
01:12:52,830 --> 01:12:56,040
strictures put in place to support that.

1521
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:58,920
But also to punish deviation from it.
And you'd say,

1522
01:12:58,921 --> 01:12:59,461
well,
you know,

1523
01:12:59,461 --> 01:13:02,070
maybe,
maybe not so much on the punishment in,

1524
01:13:02,071 --> 01:13:03,570
but you could,
it depends.

1525
01:13:03,571 --> 01:13:04,830
It's like what do you want?
What,

1526
01:13:04,831 --> 01:13:05,664
what is it that you want?
You want a longterm stable relationship 

1527
01:13:08,431 --> 01:13:10,290
or not.
And if that's the goal,

1528
01:13:10,291 --> 01:13:11,124
then your behavior should be devoted to 
whatever it is that facilitates that 

1529
01:13:14,101 --> 01:13:15,990
goal.
And I don't see that.

1530
01:13:16,170 --> 01:13:20,460
I certainly don't see that casual and 
impulsive sex fits that bill now,

1531
01:13:20,490 --> 01:13:21,323
not in the least.
And all of the evidence with regards to 

1532
01:13:24,030 --> 01:13:24,863
living together shows that that's 
actually detrimental to the 

1533
01:13:27,511 --> 01:13:29,430
establishment of a longterm 
relationship.

1534
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:32,160
So first of all,
common law marriage,

1535
01:13:32,190 --> 01:13:35,520
people who are in common law marriage 
are much more likely to be be divorced.

1536
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:36,793
So that's the first thing.
The second thing is people who live 

1537
01:13:38,971 --> 01:13:39,804
together before they get married are 
much more likely to be divorced after 

1538
01:13:42,301 --> 01:13:43,134
they get married.

1539
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:47,100
So the idea that while you can try 
someone on for size and see how it works

1540
01:13:47,101 --> 01:13:48,960
and then you're going to see if you're 
compatible,

1541
01:13:48,961 --> 01:13:51,630
it's like that's one story.
Another story is,

1542
01:13:52,020 --> 01:13:52,621
well,
how about you?

1543
01:13:52,621 --> 01:13:55,020
And I lived together for a little while 
and you know,

1544
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:57,090
if you're,
you're not so bad,

1545
01:13:57,091 --> 01:13:59,430
but maybe I can find someone better.
And if I do,

1546
01:13:59,460 --> 01:14:00,293
you know,
in the next year and a half or so 

1547
01:14:00,961 --> 01:14:03,330
because we're not hooked together in any
formal way,

1548
01:14:03,390 --> 01:14:05,190
I can just trade you in.
It's okay,

1549
01:14:05,191 --> 01:14:06,024
you can do the same to me.
But I don't really see that as the sort 

1550
01:14:08,881 --> 01:14:09,714
of complimentary mutual interaction that
leads to the formulation of long term 

1551
01:14:13,901 --> 01:14:14,734
trust.
And I think it's a better story for 

1552
01:14:16,721 --> 01:14:18,910
interpreting what constitutes living 
together then.

1553
01:14:19,030 --> 01:14:19,601
Well,
you know,

1554
01:14:19,601 --> 01:14:20,434
we're going to try each other out 
because that's what mature people would 

1555
01:14:22,511 --> 01:14:24,160
do.
A store rental.

1556
01:14:24,550 --> 01:14:25,450
Yeah,
well that's right.

1557
01:14:25,451 --> 01:14:27,370
Wash the rental cars Reagan uses.
Yeah.

1558
01:14:27,580 --> 01:14:28,271
Yeah.
Well that's,

1559
01:14:28,271 --> 01:14:29,950
that's it.
But what more,

1560
01:14:29,951 --> 01:14:30,784
most importantly,
the data indicate that it doesn't work 

1561
01:14:33,460 --> 01:14:35,140
is that you're more likely to get 
divorced,

1562
01:14:35,141 --> 01:14:37,840
not less likely because maybe the right 
attitude is,

1563
01:14:38,230 --> 01:14:40,510
well,
you're probably about as flawed as me.

1564
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:42,460
And you know,
we're lucky that we found each other.

1565
01:14:42,461 --> 01:14:43,294
And so let's see if we can make a 
commitment because we're engaging in 

1566
01:14:46,361 --> 01:14:47,920
something that's very risky,
you know,

1567
01:14:47,921 --> 01:14:48,754
an intimate relationship and we're going
to commit to each other and see if we 

1568
01:14:51,131 --> 01:14:53,470
can build something of value across 
time.

1569
01:14:54,010 --> 01:14:54,843
And there's a definite a risk in that.
But there's a compliment to your 

1570
01:14:56,831 --> 01:14:57,551
partner.
It's like,

1571
01:14:57,551 --> 01:14:58,384
well,
I think you're worth making a sacrifice 

1572
01:15:00,581 --> 01:15:02,560
for.
And what's the sacrifice?

1573
01:15:02,561 --> 01:15:03,850
Well,
it's everyone else.

1574
01:15:04,030 --> 01:15:04,863
It's a big sacrifice and there's,
and if you don't see that as a 

1575
01:15:07,481 --> 01:15:08,314
compliment,
then I don't think you're thinking 

1576
01:15:10,211 --> 01:15:11,044
because not only is it a compliment,
it's sort of like the ultimate 

1577
01:15:13,241 --> 01:15:14,074
compliment.
And maybe you don't get to have a 

1578
01:15:15,521 --> 01:15:18,190
marriage that works without that 
compliment.

1579
01:15:18,191 --> 01:15:19,024
Maybe it's so difficult to establish a 
longterm relationship that's functional 

1580
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:23,553
that you have to make a walloping 
sacrifice very early on in the 

1581
01:15:26,051 --> 01:15:28,960
relationship in order for that to even 
be a possibility.

1582
01:15:29,430 --> 01:15:30,263
And you know,
maybe not because what the hell do we 

1583
01:15:31,421 --> 01:15:33,460
know about what binds people together?
But,

1584
01:15:34,290 --> 01:15:37,480
but it's not that easy to stay with 
someone for a long period of time.

1585
01:15:37,481 --> 01:15:37,941
You know,
it's,

1586
01:15:37,941 --> 01:15:40,450
it's a real,
it's a real commitment.

1587
01:15:40,451 --> 01:15:42,070
It takes a tremendous amount of effort.

1588
01:15:42,860 --> 01:15:43,693
Yeah.
But that actually you're bringing us 

1589
01:15:44,781 --> 01:15:48,140
back to the beginning and that your time
with Tammy and um,

1590
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:50,420
one of the things about,
I think,

1591
01:15:50,690 --> 01:15:51,523
I'm going to guess this is a bit of an 
overlooked part in your chapter in your 

1592
01:15:54,111 --> 01:15:56,840
book,
but I just was like one of my favorites.

1593
01:15:57,140 --> 01:15:59,250
It was your book on modern parenting.
No.

1594
01:15:59,251 --> 01:16:00,084
Yes.
And that was the goal and I thought I 

1595
01:16:00,991 --> 01:16:02,930
would get most trouble for,
I know,

1596
01:16:02,931 --> 01:16:05,390
but it reminded,
it's don't read that far into the book.

1597
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:06,293
Well,
well it,

1598
01:16:06,420 --> 01:16:07,460
it,
my mother,

1599
01:16:07,461 --> 01:16:08,294
when I had my first child gave me a 
1950s copy of doctor spock and he was 

1600
01:16:12,351 --> 01:16:13,184
considered so controversial and yet he's
just like the most sensible person may 

1601
01:16:16,881 --> 01:16:19,190
new children very,
very well was a pediatrician.

1602
01:16:19,580 --> 01:16:20,413
And you,
your rule for parenting is do not let 

1603
01:16:22,641 --> 01:16:25,760
your children do anything that makes you
dislike them.

1604
01:16:26,570 --> 01:16:27,403
And you kind of in that one chapter,
and it's not even one of your longest 

1605
01:16:30,921 --> 01:16:31,754
chapters,
just did this wonderful sweeping 

1606
01:16:34,011 --> 01:16:37,820
overview of modern parenting and the 
problems.

1607
01:16:38,450 --> 01:16:39,283
And in some ways that we're producing 
maybe some of these kids who are 

1608
01:16:42,350 --> 01:16:46,130
prolonging adulthood,
prolonging the markers of adulthood,

1609
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:47,440
um,
that,

1610
01:16:47,690 --> 01:16:49,910
that you feel that parents,
uh,

1611
01:16:49,970 --> 01:16:53,660
you said you see today's parents is 
terrified by their children.

1612
01:16:53,990 --> 01:16:54,823
Not least because they've denied credit 
for their role as benevolent and 

1613
01:16:57,481 --> 01:17:00,380
necessary agents of discipline,
order and conventionality.

1614
01:17:00,770 --> 01:17:01,603
And then you told some hilarious stories
about when your wife ran a daycare 

1615
01:17:03,831 --> 01:17:04,664
center out of your house and you would,
you would get into test of wills with 

1616
01:17:07,971 --> 01:17:08,804
some of the two year olds.
But the tough man [inaudible] son is 

1617
01:17:12,291 --> 01:17:14,510
ordinary.
I'm glad to hear he got married to Greg.

1618
01:17:16,450 --> 01:17:18,640
He still doesn't want to do anything he 
doesn't want to do.

1619
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:19,593
Yes,
very charming and very emotionally 

1620
01:17:20,981 --> 01:17:21,814
stable.
So it's like he's easy to get along 

1621
01:17:23,741 --> 01:17:25,390
with,
but trying to get him to do something he

1622
01:17:25,391 --> 01:17:26,224
doesn't want to do.
It's like he had my wife defeated when 

1623
01:17:28,031 --> 01:17:30,400
he was nine months old and she's tough.
Like,

1624
01:17:30,490 --> 01:17:31,360
seriously,
she,

1625
01:17:31,361 --> 01:17:32,194
she's no pushover,
but he would just sit there with his 

1626
01:17:33,881 --> 01:17:34,714
mouth closed and glare at her.
It's like I'm not eating out and I can 

1627
01:17:37,901 --> 01:17:41,110
take more than you can dish out.
It was really something to see,

1628
01:17:41,111 --> 01:17:41,944
you know,
to see that kind of force of will and 

1629
01:17:43,061 --> 01:17:44,200
someone not small.

1630
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:45,333
Let's talk a little bit about that.
And just the modern roles between men 

1631
01:17:49,691 --> 01:17:51,070
and women.
I mean we're less,

1632
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:52,630
you know,
you don't really,

1633
01:17:52,631 --> 01:17:53,464
you're not really supposed to 
distinguish between fathers and mothers 

1634
01:17:55,811 --> 01:17:59,070
even though that seems to inevitably 
happen in most [inaudible].

1635
01:17:59,340 --> 01:18:02,460
Well it happens in large part because 
the children differentiate between them.

1636
01:18:02,461 --> 01:18:03,294
Like parents are under the delusion that
most of what you do with your children 

1637
01:18:05,821 --> 01:18:06,654
is driven by what you want to do with 
your children when in fact it's driven 

1638
01:18:09,541 --> 01:18:13,530
to a massive degree by what your 
children want you to do with them.

1639
01:18:13,980 --> 01:18:18,980
And so there were studies done 30 years 
ago on feminist parents who decided that

1640
01:18:20,251 --> 01:18:23,670
they were going to raise their children 
in non gender differentiated manners.

1641
01:18:23,671 --> 01:18:24,504
And when they were studied they found 
that the parents who had that explicit 

1642
01:18:27,331 --> 01:18:30,420
philosophy,
we're just as gender differentiated with

1643
01:18:30,421 --> 01:18:32,790
their children as the parents who didn't
have with the philosophy.

1644
01:18:32,791 --> 01:18:33,624
And the reason for that is that if 
you're a parent that has any sense at 

1645
01:18:36,691 --> 01:18:40,020
all,
you don't re respond to your children as

1646
01:18:40,021 --> 01:18:43,050
a rigid idiot log.
You respond to them as whatever it is.

1647
01:18:43,050 --> 01:18:47,520
The child man manifests himself,
him or herself as like,

1648
01:18:47,580 --> 01:18:49,770
you know,
with any individualized relationship,

1649
01:18:49,890 --> 01:18:53,100
you take your cue from the person and 
you might think,

1650
01:18:53,101 --> 01:18:55,850
well a child has no intrinsic nature.
But you know,

1651
01:18:55,860 --> 01:19:00,860
if you think that you either don't have 
children or you've never seen a child or

1652
01:19:00,901 --> 01:19:04,290
you're so blinded by your radiology that
you don't have a child,

1653
01:19:04,291 --> 01:19:05,124
you just have a blank projection screen 
onto which you project your 

1654
01:19:07,951 --> 01:19:10,770
presuppositions and then heaven help 
your child.

1655
01:19:11,070 --> 01:19:12,390
You know?
Um,

1656
01:19:12,510 --> 01:19:13,343
so,
so a lot of the gender differentiation 

1657
01:19:14,731 --> 01:19:18,450
is actually driven by the children's 
demands and that's all for the good.

1658
01:19:18,810 --> 01:19:19,643
That chapter,
I thought I would get into tremendous 

1659
01:19:21,481 --> 01:19:22,314
trouble for writing that chapter because
it's contentious right on the surface 

1660
01:19:25,230 --> 01:19:26,063
just to the rule because the rule first 
implies the children can be dislikable 

1661
01:19:30,090 --> 01:19:31,740
and then I would say again,
you know,

1662
01:19:31,890 --> 01:19:32,940
like have you met children?

1663
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:33,893
Exactly.
We have a very child where their 

1664
01:19:34,771 --> 01:19:37,260
children,
you didn't like obviously,

1665
01:19:37,261 --> 01:19:38,094
and so lots of children or dislikable,
but it's taboo to admit that because 

1666
01:19:40,891 --> 01:19:43,950
they're all sweetness and light and 
innocence ever since Rousseau.

1667
01:19:44,160 --> 01:19:46,950
But you know,
we so put all five of his children in an

1668
01:19:46,951 --> 01:19:50,070
orphanage where they all died.
So maybe we won't.

1669
01:19:50,370 --> 01:19:52,860
So we won't talk too much about 
Rousseau.

1670
01:19:53,580 --> 01:19:56,730
And um,
and then the next taboo is,

1671
01:19:56,790 --> 01:19:58,800
well,
that parents can dislike their children,

1672
01:19:58,940 --> 01:19:59,773
right?
But if you're a clinician and you don't 

1673
01:20:01,141 --> 01:20:03,210
think that parents can dislike their 
children,

1674
01:20:03,211 --> 01:20:06,870
then well then,
well then you're not a clinician because

1675
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:07,853
one of the things you constantly see is 
that pathology within families is an 

1676
01:20:12,361 --> 01:20:17,250
incredibly con common source of 
psychological destabilization,

1677
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:18,113
right?
And it's terrible tension between 

1678
01:20:19,501 --> 01:20:21,390
parents and their children in between 
siblings.

1679
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:23,940
What I suggest in the,
in the book,

1680
01:20:23,941 --> 01:20:27,360
which I think is radical by today's 
standards,

1681
01:20:27,361 --> 01:20:32,361
is that your fundamental job as a parent
is to ensure that by the time your child

1682
01:20:34,441 --> 01:20:35,274
is four years old,
that they are maximally desirable to 

1683
01:20:38,701 --> 01:20:39,534
other children and to adults.
Because what happens is that after the 

1684
01:20:43,681 --> 01:20:44,514
age of four,
you aren't the primary agent of 

1685
01:20:46,591 --> 01:20:47,424
socialization.
The social world becomes the primary 

1686
01:20:50,341 --> 01:20:51,174
agent of socialization and if your child
is the sort of child that's invited to 

1687
01:20:55,501 --> 01:20:56,334
play by other children because your 
child is capable of for stolen 

1688
01:20:59,551 --> 01:21:03,600
gratification and taking turns and 
playing someone else's game when,

1689
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:04,553
when it's necessary and abiding by the 
rules and not having a temper tantrum 

1690
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:10,890
when they lose and not getting to,
you know,

1691
01:21:11,550 --> 01:21:14,340
high on their horse when they win,
then many children,

1692
01:21:14,341 --> 01:21:15,970
we'll invite them.
Sorry.

1693
01:21:17,250 --> 01:21:18,083
Oh wait,
wait.

1694
01:21:18,820 --> 01:21:21,040
I don't know what you mean.
Just say it.

1695
01:21:21,100 --> 01:21:22,010
What do you want me to know?
I,

1696
01:21:22,011 --> 01:21:22,844
I know we have,
we have our limited time and so I just 

1697
01:21:25,451 --> 01:21:26,590
wanted to,
I was actually saying

1698
01:21:27,590 --> 01:21:28,423
any more.

1699
01:21:29,660 --> 01:21:30,493
This is great.
I was selfish of me because I really 

1700
01:21:32,331 --> 01:21:33,980
wanted to hear you talking about,
I know.

1701
01:21:33,981 --> 01:21:37,810
I just want to let them all take 15 
seconds to wrap that up and then stop.

1702
01:21:37,811 --> 01:21:38,601
Please.
Well.

1703
01:21:38,601 --> 01:21:39,434
So look,

1704
01:21:39,590 --> 01:21:40,423
you get married when you have your 
children and you're flawed and your 

1705
01:21:43,461 --> 01:21:46,040
partner's flawed and hopefully you're 
flawed and different ways.

1706
01:21:46,041 --> 01:21:46,874
And so you put the two of you together 
and you make one approximately normal 

1707
01:21:49,581 --> 01:21:54,581
person and then hopefully,
and then your child has to interact with

1708
01:21:54,831 --> 01:21:55,664
that dyad.
That is a reasonable representative of 

1709
01:21:58,341 --> 01:22:01,370
social norms.
And if they disappear,

1710
01:22:01,430 --> 01:22:04,790
if your child disappoints you with their
behavior,

1711
01:22:04,970 --> 01:22:08,570
the probability that they will 
disappoint other people is very high.

1712
01:22:08,870 --> 01:22:09,703
And so you have an ethical obligation to
ensure that your child is behaving in a 

1713
01:22:14,031 --> 01:22:18,530
manner that makes them optimally 
desirable to their playmates and also to

1714
01:22:18,531 --> 01:22:19,364
other adults.
Because then the kids invite them to 

1715
01:22:22,041 --> 01:22:25,130
play and they get to be socialized,
right?

1716
01:22:25,131 --> 01:22:27,170
They get,
they have friends for God's sake.

1717
01:22:27,171 --> 01:22:28,430
It's like,
what do you want for your kids?

1718
01:22:28,431 --> 01:22:30,770
How about some friends?
Wouldn't that be nice?

1719
01:22:31,010 --> 01:22:31,843
And maybe what you'd like is that they 
regulate their behavior well enough so 

1720
01:22:34,641 --> 01:22:37,970
that when you take them places,
restaurants to see your friends,

1721
01:22:37,971 --> 01:22:38,804
to see your relatives,
they behave in a manner that's 

1722
01:22:40,611 --> 01:22:41,444
sufficiently civilized.
So their intrinsic charm wins over the 

1723
01:22:45,291 --> 01:22:48,950
adults and everywhere they go,
people are smiling and welcoming instead

1724
01:22:48,951 --> 01:22:49,784
of wishing with fake smiles that the 
damn Bruh would leave along with their 

1725
01:22:53,721 --> 01:22:56,090
foolish parents,
which is not a good,

1726
01:22:56,270 --> 01:22:57,103
that's not a good environment to have 
your child constantly exposed to no 

1727
01:23:01,911 --> 01:23:06,911
friends because they're too selfish and 
immature and irritated era irritating to

1728
01:23:07,271 --> 01:23:11,560
adults so that they're barely tolerated 
under the mask of false smiles.

1729
01:23:11,980 --> 01:23:12,813
It's like you have an ethical obligation
to regulate your child's behavior so 

1730
01:23:15,851 --> 01:23:17,800
that they're optimally acceptable 
socially.

1731
01:23:17,950 --> 01:23:21,130
And that is not how people look at 
children in the modern world.

1732
01:23:21,131 --> 01:23:21,964
They think,
well you raising their self esteem or 

1733
01:23:23,531 --> 01:23:24,364
you're enhancing their creativity or you
don't want to put constraints on their 

1734
01:23:26,831 --> 01:23:27,664
behavior because you're going to 
interfere with the flowering of their 

1735
01:23:30,011 --> 01:23:31,780
intrinsic self.
And you know,

1736
01:23:31,781 --> 01:23:34,620
it's all Bruce Soliah nonsense and,
and,

1737
01:23:34,640 --> 01:23:39,370
and,
and there's no evidence that's rice.

1738
01:23:39,870 --> 01:23:40,990
Yeah.
Father,

1739
01:23:41,020 --> 01:23:41,950
yeah,
he was straight

1740
01:23:42,410 --> 01:23:43,243
am such a corrupt and he had these 
babies with this poor scullery maid and 

1741
01:23:46,941 --> 01:23:51,941
left them all in a actually a place 
where they would just languish and die.

1742
01:23:52,830 --> 01:23:53,341
Yeah.
Right.

1743
01:23:53,341 --> 01:23:54,690
Five of them.
Rousseau.

1744
01:23:54,750 --> 01:23:55,470
Yeah,
no,

1745
01:23:55,470 --> 01:23:56,281
I know.
Yeah,

1746
01:23:56,281 --> 01:23:57,390
exactly.
Oh,

1747
01:23:57,400 --> 01:23:59,220
and Ben.
Ben Is intrinsically good.

1748
01:23:59,350 --> 01:24:00,260
Yeah.
What external?

1749
01:24:00,370 --> 01:24:01,203
Sean,
Sean,

1750
01:24:02,820 --> 01:24:03,653
a few weeks ago I was reading about you 
in and somehow I got onto somebody's 

1751
01:24:07,651 --> 01:24:10,500
twitter feed whom I will not mention 
because,

1752
01:24:10,530 --> 01:24:11,730
oh my God.
But anyway,

1753
01:24:11,820 --> 01:24:16,320
a difficult person and she was attacking
you and had a,

1754
01:24:16,550 --> 01:24:17,383
a selection from your book a bit where 
you had called two-year-olds little 

1755
01:24:21,691 --> 01:24:22,524
monsters.
And so suddenly all of these distraught 

1756
01:24:26,281 --> 01:24:29,310
twitter followers of this feminist we're
saying,

1757
01:24:29,340 --> 01:24:32,070
ah,
called the monster.

1758
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:34,880
Yeah.
Little monsters and nobody,

1759
01:24:34,910 --> 01:24:37,440
and then occasionally there'd be a 
parent

1760
01:24:37,540 --> 01:24:38,373
who would take,
they kind of two year olds kind of our 

1761
01:24:40,931 --> 01:24:41,830
monsters,
you know,

1762
01:24:41,831 --> 01:24:42,664
and then there'd be eh,
and they can kind of art and they had 

1763
01:24:45,281 --> 01:24:49,770
taken this out of context and shown it 
like just something to deplore in a bit.

1764
01:24:49,780 --> 01:24:52,460
And it was so amusing to me this little,

1765
01:24:52,540 --> 01:24:54,240
hopefully they will soon be cursed with 
some too.

1766
01:24:58,430 --> 01:24:59,890
I won't tell say which one was two years
old.

1767
01:24:59,891 --> 01:25:00,020
Yeah.

1768
01:25:00,020 --> 01:25:02,010
Had,
he was a good boy,

1769
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:05,460
but he had an insane meltdown in a 
supermarket.

1770
01:25:05,580 --> 01:25:07,910
I was with my mother.
We both pretended we didn't know.

1771
01:25:07,950 --> 01:25:11,160
No,
I don't want to be the parent.

1772
01:25:11,300 --> 01:25:12,870
Oh yeah.
Watch.

1773
01:25:12,871 --> 01:25:14,400
And we heard people say,
oh my God,

1774
01:25:14,401 --> 01:25:16,860
look at that.
A child watching a two year old having a

1775
01:25:16,861 --> 01:25:18,870
Tantrum is,
it's so terrifying.

1776
01:25:19,020 --> 01:25:20,940
I didn't want to be associated with you.
The

1777
01:25:21,030 --> 01:25:24,120
boy who used to be like,
when my wife was taken care of more kids

1778
01:25:24,121 --> 01:25:26,110
than ours,
there was a little boy who,

1779
01:25:26,140 --> 01:25:28,470
who,
who had learned to throw a pretty decent

1780
01:25:28,471 --> 01:25:29,304
town and uh,
and he would do that and it didn't work 

1781
01:25:32,041 --> 01:25:32,874
in our house because we just leave him,
have his tantrum and going into to a 

1782
01:25:35,101 --> 01:25:37,250
different room and then he'd kind of 
wake up out of it.

1783
01:25:37,300 --> 01:25:39,000
There wouldn't be anybody around.
And so that,

1784
01:25:39,330 --> 01:25:40,163
like if you put all that words audience,
dramatic display and you have zero 

1785
01:25:43,081 --> 01:25:43,891
audios,
it's not,

1786
01:25:43,891 --> 01:25:47,050
you're not going to sustain it anyways.
He could actually turn,

1787
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:51,020
hold his breath until he turned blue.
So you should try that.

1788
01:25:51,030 --> 01:25:53,160
You go home and see if you could do that
in front of the mirror man.

1789
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:55,260
Like it's hard.
It's very,

1790
01:25:55,261 --> 01:25:57,330
very good.
You have to hire it will you do.

1791
01:25:57,330 --> 01:25:58,620
It was impressive.
It was.

1792
01:25:58,780 --> 01:26:01,110
And you know,
two year olds are very impressive.

1793
01:26:01,140 --> 01:26:01,973
They're there,
they have unbelievable of rage and 

1794
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:06,740
dis-inhibited emotion.
And your job is,

1795
01:26:07,130 --> 01:26:07,641
you know,
they're,

1796
01:26:07,641 --> 01:26:08,474
they're driven by these underlying 
motivational systems that are 

1797
01:26:11,421 --> 01:26:12,254
unbelievably powerful.
And it's part of what makes them 

1798
01:26:13,941 --> 01:26:17,270
delightful because when they're happy,
they're insanely happy.

1799
01:26:17,271 --> 01:26:19,760
And when they're playful,
they're incredibly playful.

1800
01:26:19,761 --> 01:26:23,930
And so the positive end of them is,
is way exaggerated compared to,

1801
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:25,380
you know,
a rather drab adult.

1802
01:26:25,381 --> 01:26:26,214
And,
and so it makes two year olds 

1803
01:26:27,051 --> 01:26:27,884
extraordinarily interesting.
But the same is true on the negative 

1804
01:26:30,411 --> 01:26:32,840
emotion side.
They're completely dysregulated and it's

1805
01:26:32,841 --> 01:26:36,080
really hard on them.
Like to have a two year old who isn't in

1806
01:26:36,081 --> 01:26:36,914
control of their emotions means that you
have a child who's developing central 

1807
01:26:40,851 --> 01:26:41,900
personality,
you know,

1808
01:26:41,901 --> 01:26:42,830
their,
their ego,

1809
01:26:42,831 --> 01:26:43,664
for lack of a better word,
is constantly being swamped by these 

1810
01:26:46,401 --> 01:26:48,470
powerful underlying emotional systems.

1811
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:49,513
You know what it's like if you are 
enraged for any period of time or if 

1812
01:26:52,281 --> 01:26:54,950
you're engulfed by grief,
like it's exhausting.

1813
01:26:55,160 --> 01:26:55,880
It's,
it's,

1814
01:26:55,880 --> 01:26:59,300
it's demeaning and it's exhausting.
And it's the same with a little kid.

1815
01:26:59,301 --> 01:27:00,134
It's like it's a real defeat for the 
developing integrated individual to be 

1816
01:27:05,001 --> 01:27:09,800
subjugated by those catastrophic,
powerful emergency motions.

1817
01:27:09,801 --> 01:27:10,634
And part of your job as a parent is to 
scaffold the part of the child that can 

1818
01:27:15,141 --> 01:27:18,230
regulate and inhibit those powerful 
underlying systems.

1819
01:27:18,231 --> 01:27:19,880
So with my son,
for example,

1820
01:27:19,881 --> 01:27:22,550
when he used to misbehave,
I would count,

1821
01:27:22,580 --> 01:27:24,170
let's say you're going to go sit on the 
steps.

1822
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:25,760
He'd say,
oh no I'm not.

1823
01:27:26,030 --> 01:27:28,340
I say,
Oh yes you are.

1824
01:27:28,490 --> 01:27:31,400
And then usually I'd have to chase him 
around because he wouldn't go sit on the

1825
01:27:31,401 --> 01:27:33,050
steps.
And so I put him on the steps.

1826
01:27:33,290 --> 01:27:36,230
Say you're going to sit there until 
you've got yourself under control.

1827
01:27:36,950 --> 01:27:37,790
And so he'd say,
no,

1828
01:27:37,791 --> 01:27:38,624
I not say yes you are.
And then he tried to get up and I just 

1829
01:27:41,001 --> 01:27:42,920
told them,
say you're going to sit there,

1830
01:27:42,921 --> 01:27:44,630
I'm going to hold you until you sit 
there.

1831
01:27:45,080 --> 01:27:46,010
No,
I'm not.

1832
01:27:46,040 --> 01:27:48,740
It's like I could out wait a two year 
old.

1833
01:27:49,220 --> 01:27:52,140
So I usually won those battles and then 
he'd sit there and I say,

1834
01:27:52,141 --> 01:27:53,330
look kid,
this is the deal.

1835
01:27:53,331 --> 01:27:54,164
Let's say two things,
like you want to have a bad day or you 

1836
01:27:55,461 --> 01:27:57,620
want to have a good day,
you think about that because if you want

1837
01:27:57,621 --> 01:27:58,690
to have a good day,
no,

1838
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:01,820
you can just have a better idea.
If you want to have a bad day,

1839
01:28:01,821 --> 01:28:02,654
we could have a bad days.
You sit here and as soon as you can 

1840
01:28:04,281 --> 01:28:05,114
control yourself and you're ready to be 
civilized than you can come back and we 

1841
01:28:08,241 --> 01:28:12,620
can have a good day.
So He'd sit there just,

1842
01:28:12,710 --> 01:28:14,480
just,
it was unbelievable to watch.

1843
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:16,940
Just the developed with rage,
you know,

1844
01:28:16,941 --> 01:28:19,910
just trying to get himself under 
control,

1845
01:28:19,911 --> 01:28:20,744
you know?
And so I'd come back 30 seconds later 

1846
01:28:21,981 --> 01:28:23,660
and I'd say,
you know,

1847
01:28:24,070 --> 01:28:26,640
but it's got yourself,
got your act together yet.

1848
01:28:27,310 --> 01:28:30,310
No,
no.

1849
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:31,473
I wait.
And usually it took them two or three 

1850
01:28:33,021 --> 01:28:35,690
minutes and he'd calm down and then he'd
come back out and you'd say,

1851
01:28:35,910 --> 01:28:38,030
I'm ready to have a good day.
And he meant it,

1852
01:28:38,060 --> 01:28:39,590
you know?
And I can tell he meant it too,

1853
01:28:39,591 --> 01:28:40,424
because whatever resentment I was 
harboring towards him for his 

1854
01:28:43,731 --> 01:28:44,564
misbehavior.
And you have to watch that when you're 

1855
01:28:46,251 --> 01:28:48,860
an adult would vanish because he'd come 
and he'd,

1856
01:28:49,550 --> 01:28:51,050
he was done.
He was ready,

1857
01:28:51,051 --> 01:28:51,890
just,
you know,

1858
01:28:51,891 --> 01:28:52,724
to proceed on a civilized basis.
And it was really interesting to watch 

1859
01:28:56,061 --> 01:29:00,020
that because it took him every time he 
sat on the steps,

1860
01:29:00,021 --> 01:29:02,760
it took them a shorter and shorter 
period of time to attain mastery.

1861
01:29:02,790 --> 01:29:03,570
Right.
Until,

1862
01:29:03,570 --> 01:29:04,403
you know,
it got to the point where he could only 

1863
01:29:05,911 --> 01:29:10,620
have to sit for 15 seconds or so when he
would bring himself under control.

1864
01:29:10,710 --> 01:29:12,610
And that was a victory.
Like you,

1865
01:29:12,780 --> 01:29:13,613
if you imagine the neurological systems 
develop that are responsible for 

1866
01:29:16,441 --> 01:29:17,274
personality integration,
it was a victory for those systems 

1867
01:29:19,621 --> 01:29:22,900
because they were attaining the ability 
to regulate the lower order,

1868
01:29:22,901 --> 01:29:25,980
spontaneous emotions and you know,
and,

1869
01:29:26,070 --> 01:29:26,903
and he,
he turned into an individual who's 

1870
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:31,860
capable of a tremendous level of self 
control and you know,

1871
01:29:31,861 --> 01:29:32,490
when he had

1872
01:29:32,490 --> 01:29:34,590
large gaming with,
yes,

1873
01:29:35,220 --> 01:29:36,500
absolutely.
And,

1874
01:29:36,501 --> 01:29:38,750
and while it didn't turned out well for 
my daughter to be,

1875
01:29:38,790 --> 01:29:39,623
cause she ended up being very ill and he
ended up being extraordinarily 

1876
01:29:42,630 --> 01:29:44,100
levelheaded,
dead reliable,

1877
01:29:44,101 --> 01:29:45,360
and thank God for that.

1878
01:29:45,770 --> 01:29:46,603
Could you,
could you come to my house and do that 

1879
01:29:47,571 --> 01:29:50,600
for my little multiple izzy?
Because I can't,

1880
01:29:51,110 --> 01:29:53,200
I can't,
I can't eat.

1881
01:29:53,330 --> 01:29:55,420
I can't train her.
She's like a woman and ice.

1882
01:29:55,430 --> 01:29:56,263
The next book a dog.
I would love to have rules on how to 

1883
01:29:59,301 --> 01:30:02,030
train your dog.
You like cats.

1884
01:30:02,070 --> 01:30:02,871
What?
I,

1885
01:30:02,871 --> 01:30:06,110
that's the one role I objected to like 
what's with petting the cat.

1886
01:30:06,170 --> 01:30:08,510
I wrote about dogs for two pages to 
begin with,

1887
01:30:08,511 --> 01:30:10,940
just to satisfy the dog that didn't 
satisfy.

1888
01:30:11,160 --> 01:30:11,993
They're not,
they got a score.

1889
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:14,630
You can't satisfy them.
No.

1890
01:30:14,631 --> 01:30:15,140
Right.
Well,

1891
01:30:15,140 --> 01:30:17,000
we can't thank you enough for coming 
here.

1892
01:30:17,020 --> 01:30:17,853
Um,
I know the Aei audience is just so 

1893
01:30:21,741 --> 01:30:23,270
delighted to have had the chance to hear
you.

1894
01:30:23,300 --> 01:30:24,133
Well.
I'm really personally got the chance to 

1895
01:30:25,071 --> 01:30:28,610
talk.
I've only met you once.

1896
01:30:28,611 --> 01:30:29,444
We met in DC,
but I've just seen you pass the 

1897
01:30:32,170 --> 01:30:33,170
electronics.
Yes.

1898
01:30:33,171 --> 01:30:33,621
Yes.
Oh,

1899
01:30:33,621 --> 01:30:35,560
you've swiped past.
Oh yeah.

1900
01:30:35,730 --> 01:30:36,561
Well,
there was that.

1901
01:30:36,561 --> 01:30:37,940
We're not going into that.
Okay.

1902
01:30:38,210 --> 01:30:39,450
Thank you everybody.
Thank you.

1903
01:30:39,451 --> 01:30:40,284
Thank you Jordan.
