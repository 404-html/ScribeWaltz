Hi Everyone,
back on February 20th,

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,720
I announced that I was going to go to 12
different cities in North America and 

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,330
talk about my new book,
12 rules for life and a variety of other

4
00:00:13,331 --> 00:00:18,331
things and so we arranged theaters and 
put those tickets up for sale and 

5
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:24,540
they've proved very popular.
I did the first one this week on Sunday 

6
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:30,180
in New York at the beacon theater to an 
audience of about 3000 people and it 

7
00:00:30,221 --> 00:00:34,840
seemed to go very well.
The consequences of that is that I'm now

8
00:00:34,841 --> 00:00:38,860
announcing another 20 cities and this is
the video to make that announcement.

9
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:42,370
I'm also appearing as a guest with 
several other speakers,

10
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:45,790
including Matt Dillahunty,
Sam Harris,

11
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:49,480
a number of times,
and also Sam Harris and Douglas Murray,

12
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:54,930
and so the announcements for those who 
will be included in the description of 

13
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,201
this video as well.
All these talks are going to occur from 

14
00:00:58,201 --> 00:01:00,820
