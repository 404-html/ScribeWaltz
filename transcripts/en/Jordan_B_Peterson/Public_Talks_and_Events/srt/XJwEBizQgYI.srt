1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:05,450
Earlier this year,
I was invited by Nick Skidmore,

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:10,660
editor,
a vintage classics at Penguin to write 

3
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:14,081
the forward to the 50th anniversary 
edition of the single volume of bridged 

4
00:00:14,271 --> 00:00:18,320
version of Alexander's Solzhenitsyn's,
the Gulag archipelago.

5
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:24,220
This was perhaps the single greatest 
honor that has ever be fallen me given 

6
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:28,721
the historical importance of Social 
Nixon's book as well as its great 

7
00:00:28,721 --> 00:00:29,390
personal impact on me.

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:36,100
The Gulag archipelago in its full form 
was a three volume text,

9
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:41,380
originally written between 1958 and 1968
at first saw publication in 1973 and was

10
00:00:43,611 --> 00:00:48,611
translated into English a year later.
It describes life in the Soviet forced 

11
00:00:50,421 --> 00:00:54,230
labor camp system,
the ghoulag through a narrative compiled

12
00:00:54,231 --> 00:00:57,440
from interviews,
personal statements from inmates,

13
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,980
diaries,
legal and historical documents,

14
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:06,490
and the author's own experience as a 
gulag prisoner following its appearance.

15
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:11,860
The books circulated underground in the 
Soviet Union until its formal 

16
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,690
publication in 1989 in the literary 
journal Novy Mirror,

17
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:19,990
which published a third of the work in 
three issues since the Soviet Union 

18
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:24,761
dissolved.
The entire book has been published and 

19
00:01:24,761 --> 00:01:26,690
has been made mandatory reading in the 
Russian school curriculum.

20
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:33,090
The 50th anniversary edition is slated 
for release November first 2018.

21
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,680
Here's a brief biography of the author 
Alexander Social Nitsa from the book 

22
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:49,680
social units and was born in 1918 and 
grew up in Rostov on dawn.

23
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:55,200
He graduated in physics and mathematics 
from Rostov University and studied 

24
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,761
literature by correspondence course at 
Moscow university in World War II.

25
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:05,060
He fought as an artillery officer 
attaining the rank of captain in 1945.

26
00:02:06,491 --> 00:02:11,491
However,
after making derogatory remarks about 

27
00:02:11,491 --> 00:02:14,851
Stalin in a letter,
he was arrested and summarily sentenced 

28
00:02:14,851 --> 00:02:18,991
to eight years in forced labor camps,
followed by internal exile in 1957.

29
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:24,160
He was formerly rehabilitated and 
settled down to teaching and writing.

30
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,520
Here's a description of the book from 
the back cover.

31
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:34,950
The officially approved abridgment of 
the Gulag archipelago volumes one,

32
00:02:34,951 --> 00:02:35,790
two,
and three.

33
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,560
A vast canvas of camps,
prisons,

34
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:46,080
transit centers,
and secret police of informers and spies

35
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,380
and interrogators,
but also of everyday heroism.

36
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,330
The Gulag archipelago is Alexander 
Solzhenitsyn as grand master work.

37
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,840
Based on the testimony of some 200 
survivors and on the recollection of 

38
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,350
soldier units and his own 11 years in 
labor camps in exile,

39
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,680
it chronicles the story of those at the 
heart of the Soviet Union who opposed 

40
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,480
stolen and for whom the key to survival 
lay,

41
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:12,730
not in hope,
but in despair,

42
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:18,600
a thoroughly research document and a 
feet of literary and imaginative power.

43
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:23,880
This edition of the Gulag archipelago 
was a bridged into one volume at the 

44
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,020
author's wish and with his full 
cooperation,

45
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:32,020
Doris lessing 19,
19 to 2013,

46
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,450
a British novelist,
playwright,

47
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:39,600
librettist biographer and short story 
writer and winner of the 2007 Nobel 

48
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:43,750
Prize for Literature says of the Gulag 
Archipelago.

49
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:49,200
It helped to bring down an empire.
Its importance can hardly be 

50
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,121
exaggerated.
This is Solzhenitsyn's own forward to 

51
00:03:54,451 --> 00:03:59,451
the original abridgment.
I dedicate this to all those who did not

52
00:03:59,921 --> 00:04:04,921
live to tell it,
and may they please forgive me for not 

53
00:04:04,921 --> 00:04:08,521
having seen it all nor remembered at all
for not having defined at all.

54
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:15,510
If it were possible for any nation to 
fathom another people's bitter 

55
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:18,961
experience through a book.
How much easier it's future fate would 

56
00:04:18,961 --> 00:04:21,880
become and how many calamities and 
mistakes could avoid,

57
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,540
but it is very difficult.
There always is this fallacious belief.

58
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:33,850
It would not be the same here,
here such things are impossible.

59
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:39,630
Alas,
all the evil of the 20th century is 

60
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:43,111
possible everywhere on earth.
Yet I have not given up all hope that 

61
00:04:43,111 --> 00:04:47,401
human beings in nations may be able in 
spite of all to learn from the 

62
00:04:47,401 --> 00:04:50,560
experience of other people without 
having to live through it personally.

63
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:56,430
Therefore,
I gratefully accept Professor Erickson 

64
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,270
suggestion to create a one volume 
abridgement of my three volume work,

65
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:03,160
the Gulag archipelago in order to 
facilitate it's reading for those who do

66
00:05:03,161 --> 00:05:06,580
not have much time in this hectic 
century of ours.

67
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:12,150
I think Professor Erickson for his 
generous initiative as well as for the 

68
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,710
tactfulness,
the literary taste and the understanding

69
00:05:14,711 --> 00:05:19,711
of western readers,
which he displayed during the work on 

70
00:05:19,711 --> 00:05:22,921
the abridgment Edward III Erickson 
Junior,

71
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,360
1939 to 2017 who served as the editor of
the Abridge single volume version of the

72
00:05:30,231 --> 00:05:35,231
gulag.
Archipelago was professor emeritus of 

73
00:05:35,231 --> 00:05:37,040
English at Calvin College and the author
of many other books,

74
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:42,220
including the soldier knits and reader.
The apocalyptic vision of Mikhail 

75
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:47,700
Bulgakov is the master and Margarita and
the soul and barbed wire and 

76
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:52,211
introduction to social units,
and this is what he had to say when he 

77
00:05:52,211 --> 00:05:53,600
introduced the abridged version

78
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,240
in 1994 after years of forced exile in 
the West,

79
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:04,100
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn returned to 
Russia at one town meeting,

80
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:09,101
held on his Trans Siberian whistle stop 
tour to reacquaint himself with his 

81
00:06:09,101 --> 00:06:11,450
homeland.
He was confronted by this rebuke.

82
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:17,760
It is you and your writing that started 
it all and brought our country to the 

83
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,820
verge of collapse and devastation.
Russia doesn't need you,

84
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:25,300
so go back to your blessing America 
units and instantly replied that to his 

85
00:06:27,711 --> 00:06:32,711
dying day,
he would keep fighting against the evil 

86
00:06:32,711 --> 00:06:34,700
ideology that was capable of slaying one
third of his country's population.

87
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:40,480
The meeting erupted in applause.
That sort of exchange was unimaginable 

88
00:06:41,361 --> 00:06:46,361
when the president abridgment of the 
Gulag archipelago first appeared in 

89
00:06:46,361 --> 00:06:49,631
1985.
Almost no one expected then that within 

90
00:06:49,631 --> 00:06:53,441
a few years the Soviet Union would 
collapse and almost in a day like the 

91
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:55,520
legendary one horse.
Shay.

92
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:01,180
Yep.
Now the dramatic events that put the 

93
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,191
closing punctuation mark on the Soviet 
parentheses in Russian history have 

94
00:07:03,191 --> 00:07:03,860
also,
we may say,

95
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:09,030
brought an end to what the great Russian
poet Anna Akhmatova called the true 20th

96
00:07:09,861 --> 00:07:10,490
century.

97
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:16,570
This for short and century running from 
1914 to 1917 to 1989,

98
00:07:18,141 --> 00:07:22,960
1991 was the era when Utopian dreams 
rooted in lightened,

99
00:07:22,961 --> 00:07:27,961
meant optimism came to rely on brute 
force to make ideological schemes 

100
00:07:28,011 --> 00:07:33,011
prevail.
The 20th century is proven in 

101
00:07:33,011 --> 00:07:37,421
quantitative terms,
at least the most murderous in human 

102
00:07:37,421 --> 00:07:40,661
history.
As governments killed their subjects at 

103
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:43,211
record rates for decades,
the word Holocaust served as shorthand 

104
00:07:43,431 --> 00:07:48,431
for modern man's inhumanity demand.
Then one lone man added a second such 

105
00:07:49,611 --> 00:07:54,611
term Ghoulag,
which now appears in dictionaries as a 

106
00:07:54,611 --> 00:07:58,181
common noun social units,
and was one of the precious few who did 

107
00:07:58,181 --> 00:08:01,820
anticipate the demise of the Soviet 
experiment and he thought his book would

108
00:08:01,821 --> 00:08:04,190
help.
Oh yes.

109
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,280
Ghoulag was destined to affect the 
course of history.

110
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:11,330
I was sure of that on one of his darkest
days,

111
00:08:11,331 --> 00:08:12,650
February twelfth,
Nineteen,

112
00:08:12,651 --> 00:08:17,651
74 the day before he was forced into 
exile and precisely because the Gulag 

113
00:08:17,721 --> 00:08:18,920
had appeared in the West.

114
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:24,040
He mused you Bolsheviks are finished.
There are no two ways about it,

115
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:30,730
what satisfaction he felt then when some
early reviews such as one from the 

116
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,470
Frankfurter Allgemeine,
a leading German newspaper,

117
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:38,530
caught his intentions.
The time may come when we date the 

118
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:42,080
beginning of the collapse of the Soviet 
system from the appearance of ghoulag.

119
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:48,010
American diplomat and scholar George 
Kennan hailed the work as the greatest 

120
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:52,931
and most powerful single indictment of a
political regime ever to be leveled in 

121
00:08:52,931 --> 00:08:57,281
modern times.
One sure to stick in the craw of the 

122
00:08:57,281 --> 00:09:02,271
Soviet propaganda machine with 
increasing discomfort until it is done 

123
00:09:02,271 --> 00:09:07,191
its work.
Soldier units and has proven prescient 

124
00:09:07,191 --> 00:09:12,140
on other matters as well.
Not only did he reiterated in the teeth 

125
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,760
of the prevailing opinion of Western 
specialists on Soviet affairs,

126
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:18,150
that he was absolutely convinced that 
communism will go.

127
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,600
He also insisted most resolutely and 
against all seeming reason that he 

128
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,040
expected to be reunited with his beloved
Russia.

129
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,880
In a strange way,
I not only hope,

130
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,240
I'm inwardly convinced that I shall go 
back,

131
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,420
I mean my physical return,
not just my books,

132
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:41,520
and that contradicts all rationality is 
improbable.

133
00:09:41,521 --> 00:09:44,640
Prerequisites were that his citizenship 
be restored,

134
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:49,850
that the charge of treason against him 
be dropped and that all of his books be 

135
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:53,460
published in his homeland.
After his prophecies were fulfilled.

136
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:58,110
A friend of his reminisced,
it seemed crazy to me at the time,

137
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,410
but it was a real conviction,
a poet's knowledge.

138
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,510
He sees the man sees.
However,

139
00:10:06,511 --> 00:10:11,511
historians ultimately apportion the 
credit for ending the Cold War soldier 

140
00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:15,981
units and Dubai notably played a part in
bringing the Soviet edifice down to 

141
00:10:15,981 --> 00:10:20,511
rubble.
His writings de legitimize communism in 

142
00:10:20,511 --> 00:10:24,681
his homeland and discredited it abroad.
He was much too modest in depicting 

143
00:10:24,841 --> 00:10:29,841
himself as a little calf foolishly 
budding a mighty oak and thinking this 

144
00:10:29,841 --> 00:10:34,071
could bring it down as David Remnick,
editor of the New Yorker declares in 

145
00:10:36,241 --> 00:10:38,460
terms of the effect it has had on 
history,

146
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:43,520
social units,
and is the dominant writer of the 

147
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:43,860
century.
Who Else compares?

148
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:46,770
Orwell,
Kessler.

149
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:52,680
Remnick concludes that to some extent 
you have to credit the literary works of

150
00:10:52,681 --> 00:10:57,681
Alexander Solzhenitsyn with helping to 
bring down the last empire on earth.

151
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:05,850
So after that introductory material my 
forward,

152
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:12,460
it begins with an excerpt from the 
speech delivered by soldier knits into 

153
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:16,580
the Swedish Academy on the occasion of 
his acceptance of the Nobel Prize for 

154
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,010
literature.

155
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:24,040
Once we have taken up the word,
it is thereafter impossible to turn 

156
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:28,211
away.
A writer is no detached judge of his 

157
00:11:28,211 --> 00:11:32,591
countrymen and contemporaries.
He is an accomplice to all the evil 

158
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:34,310
committed in this country or bias 
people,

159
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,810
and if the tanks of his father 
fatherland have bloodied the pavement of

160
00:11:38,811 --> 00:11:43,130
a foreign capital,
then rust colored stains have forever be

161
00:11:43,131 --> 00:11:48,131
spattered the writers face,
and if on some fateful night a trusting 

162
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:53,441
friend is strangled in his sleep than 
the palms of the writer bear,

163
00:11:53,591 --> 00:11:58,591
the bruises from that rope.
And if his youthful fellow citizens 

164
00:11:58,901 --> 00:12:03,901
nonchalantly proclaimed the advantages 
of debauchery over humbled toil.

165
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,110
If they abandon themselves to drugs or 
sees hostages,

166
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,400
then this stench to his mingled with the
breadth of the writer.

167
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:18,810
Have we the insulins to declare that we 
do not answer for the evils of today's 

168
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:22,760
world.
The simple act of an ordinary,

169
00:12:22,761 --> 00:12:27,761
brave man is not to participate in lies,
not to support false actions.

170
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,520
His rule.
Let that come into the world.

171
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:39,470
Let it even reign supreme only not 
through me,

172
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:46,980
but it is within the power of writers 
and artists to do much more to defeat 

173
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:51,391
the lie for in the struggle with lies.
Art has always triumphed and Shell 

174
00:12:51,491 --> 00:12:56,491
always triumph.
Visibly irrefutably for all lies can 

175
00:12:56,921 --> 00:13:01,300
prevail against much in this world,
but never against art.

176
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:06,870
One word of truth shall outweigh the 
whole world.

177
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:14,080
First,
you defend your homeland against the 

178
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,541
Nazis serving as a twice decorated 
soldier on the eastern front in the 

179
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:21,191
criminally ill prepared Soviet Red Army.
Then you're arrested,

180
00:13:21,651 --> 00:13:24,770
humiliated,
stripped of your military rank,

181
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,860
charged under the hospices of the all 
purpose.

182
00:13:27,861 --> 00:13:32,861
Article Fifty eight with the 
dissemination of anti Soviet propaganda 

183
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:36,290
and dragged off to Moscow's infamous 
Lubyanka prison.

184
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:43,080
They're through the bars of yourself.
You Watch your beloved country 

185
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,240
celebrating it's victory in the Great 
Patriotic War.

186
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:51,610
Then you're sentenced in absentia to 
eight years of hard labor,

187
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:57,300
but you got away easy.
It wasn't so long afterward that people 

188
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:01,201
in your position were awarded a tenor 
and then a quarter of a century and fate

189
00:14:01,961 --> 00:14:03,550
isn't finished with you,
yet,

190
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:08,140
not by any means you develop a deadly 
cancer in the camp,

191
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:13,440
endure the exile,
imposed on you after your imprisonment 

192
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,650
ends and passed,
very close to death.

193
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,100
Despite all this,
you hold your head high,

194
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:23,350
you refuse to turn against man or God,
although you have every reason to do so,

195
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:29,730
you write instead secretly at night 
documenting your terrible experiences.

196
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:35,910
You craft a personal memoir,
a single day in the labor camps and 

197
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:40,900
miracle of miracles.
The clouds part.

198
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,440
The Sun shines through.
Your book is published and in your own 

199
00:14:46,571 --> 00:14:51,571
country.
It meets with unparalleled claim 

200
00:14:51,571 --> 00:14:52,970
nationally and internationally,

201
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:57,720
but the sky darkens,
once again in the sun disappears.

202
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:00,870
The repression returns.
You become,

203
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:05,730
once again a nonperson,
the secret police,

204
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:10,350
the dread KGB sees the manuscript of 
your next book.

205
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,700
It sees the light of day nonetheless,
but only in the west.

206
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:20,990
There your reputation grows beyond the 
wildest imaginings the Nobel Committee 

207
00:15:21,631 --> 00:15:25,890
itself bestows upon you.
It's highest literary honor.

208
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,260
The Soviet authorities stripped of their
camouflage are enraged.

209
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,810
They ordered the secret police to poison
you.

210
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:39,900
You pass once again near death,
but you continue to write driven,

211
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:45,020
solitary,
intolerably inspired your gulag.

212
00:15:45,301 --> 00:15:49,170
Archipelago documents,
the absolute and utter corruption of the

213
00:15:49,171 --> 00:15:52,710
dogmas and doctrines of your state,
your empire,

214
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:58,250
your leaders and yourself,
and then that is printed to not in your 

215
00:16:02,191 --> 00:16:04,260
own country,
but in the west.

216
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:09,380
Once again from copies also dangerously 
hidden and smuggled across the borders 

217
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:14,670
and your great book bursts with 
unparalleled and dreadful force into the

218
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:18,450
still naive and unexpecting literary and
intellectual world.

219
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,700
You're expelled from the Soviet Union,
stripped of your citizenship,

220
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:29,210
forced to take residency in a society,
both strange to you and resistant in its

221
00:16:29,611 --> 00:16:34,611
own way to your prophetic words,
but the power of your stories and the 

222
00:16:34,611 --> 00:16:38,820
strength of your morals,
demolish any remaining claims to ethical

223
00:16:38,821 --> 00:16:43,821
and philosophical credibility still made
by the defenders of the collectivist 

224
00:16:43,821 --> 00:16:46,740
system that gave rise to all that you 
witnessed.

225
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:53,060
Years Pass,
but not so many from the perspective of 

226
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:57,240
history.
Then another miracle,

227
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:02,010
the Soviet Union collapses.
You return home,

228
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,880
your citizenship is restored.
You write and speak,

229
00:17:05,881 --> 00:17:10,881
and you're reclaimed homeland until 
death claims you in 2008 a year later,

230
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:15,210
the Gulag archipelago is deemed 
mandatory.

231
00:17:15,211 --> 00:17:20,211
Reading by those responsible for 
establishing the national school 

232
00:17:20,211 --> 00:17:23,210
curriculum of your home country,
you're impossible.

233
00:17:23,211 --> 00:17:24,980
Victory is complete.

234
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:32,000
The three volumes of the Gulag 
archipelago,

235
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:37,180
one continuous extended scream of 
outrage are paradoxically brilliant.

236
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:44,470
Bitter disbelieving and infused with all
are at the strength characterizing the 

237
00:17:46,461 --> 00:17:49,560
best among us in the worst of all 
situations.

238
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:54,630
In that monumental text published in 
1973,

239
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:59,840
Alexander Solzhenitsyn conducted an 
experiment in literary investigation,

240
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:03,870
a hybrid of journalism history and 
biography,

241
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:07,890
unlike anything ever written before or 
since.

242
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:13,940
In 1985,
the author bestowed his approval upon 

243
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:17,181
Edward III Erickson junior single volume
abridgement republished here on the 50th

244
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:22,200
anniversary of the completion of the 
full three volume addition and centenary

245
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:27,201
of the author's birth and sold some $30 
million copies in 35 languages between 

246
00:18:31,381 --> 00:18:36,381
the pages of Solzhenitsyn's book.
Apart from the documentation of the 

247
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:41,001
horrors of the legions of the dead 
counted and uncounted and the masses 

248
00:18:41,001 --> 00:18:45,741
whose lives were torn asunder are the 
innumerable soul chilling personal 

249
00:18:45,961 --> 00:18:50,130
stories carefully preserved,
making the tragedy of mass,

250
00:18:50,131 --> 00:18:51,630
betrayal,
torture,

251
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:52,290
and death.

252
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:57,500
Not The mere statistic stolen,
so disdainfully described,

253
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:03,260
but individual real and terrible.
It is a matter of pure historical fact 

254
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:10,520
that the Gulag archipelago played a 
primary role in bringing the Soviet 

255
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:15,030
Empire to its knees.
Although economically unsustainable,

256
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:20,120
ruled in the most corrupt manner 
imaginable and reliant on the slavery 

257
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:24,621
and enforced deceit of its citizens.
The Soviet system managed to stumble 

258
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:28,860
forward through far too many decades 
before being cut to the quick,

259
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:32,910
the courageous leaders of the labor 
unions in Poland,

260
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,690
the great Pope John Paul two and the 
American president,

261
00:19:36,691 --> 00:19:41,691
Ronald Reagan,
with his blunt insistence that the West 

262
00:19:41,691 --> 00:19:44,700
faced an evil empire all played their 
role in its defeat and collapse.

263
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:47,820
It was Solzhenitsyn,
however,

264
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:52,940
who's revelations made it positively 
shameful to defend not just the Soviet 

265
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:55,980
state,
but the very system of thought that made

266
00:19:55,981 --> 00:19:59,730
that state what it was,
it was soldier units new.

267
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:03,960
Most crucially made the case that the 
terrible excesses of communism could not

268
00:20:03,961 --> 00:20:07,890
be conveniently blamed on the corruption
of the Soviet leadership,

269
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:13,130
the cult of personality surrounding 
stolen or the failure to put the 

270
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:17,001
otherwise stellar and admirable utopian 
principles of Marxism into proper 

271
00:20:17,221 --> 00:20:17,970
practice.

272
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:24,110
It was Solzhenitsyn who demonstrated 
that the death of millions and the 

273
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:27,891
devastation of many more were instead a 
direct causal consequence of the 

274
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,360
philosophy.
Worse,

275
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:34,710
perhaps the theology driving the 
communist system,

276
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:40,460
the hypothetically egalitarian 
universalist doctrines of Karl Marx 

277
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,000
contained,
hidden within them,

278
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,670
sufficient hatred,
resentment,

279
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:49,850
envy,
and denial of culpability and 

280
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:53,431
responsibility to produce nothing but 
poison and death when manifested in the 

281
00:20:53,801 --> 00:20:58,801
world.
For Mark's man was a member of a class,

282
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:04,740
an economic class,
a group that and little more and 

283
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:09,931
history,
nothing but the battleground of classes 

284
00:21:09,931 --> 00:21:11,440
and groups is admires,
regarded,

285
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:16,300
continue to regard marks doctrine as one
of compassion,

286
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,630
moral by definition,
virtuous by fit.

287
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:25,500
Consider the working classes in all 
their oppression and work forthrightly 

288
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:29,440
to free them,
but hate may well be a stronger and more

289
00:21:29,441 --> 00:21:33,740
compelling motivator than love.
In consequence,

290
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:37,370
it took no time in the aftermath of the 
Russian revolution.

291
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:42,520
For Solidarity with the common man and 
the apparently laudable demand for 

292
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:46,991
universal quality to manifest it's 
unarticulated and ever darkening,

293
00:21:47,001 --> 00:21:47,660
shadow

294
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:54,780
first came the most brutal indictment of
the class enemy then came the ever 

295
00:21:55,931 --> 00:22:00,931
expanding definition of that enemy until
every single person in the entirety of 

296
00:22:00,931 --> 00:22:05,911
the State found him or herself at risk 
of encapsulation within that insatiable 

297
00:22:06,011 --> 00:22:11,011
and devouring net,
the verdict delivered to those deemed at

298
00:22:11,201 --> 00:22:16,201
fault by those who elevated themselves 
to this simultaneously held positions of

299
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:19,180
judge,
jury and executioner,

300
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:23,560
the necessity to eradicate the 
victimizers,

301
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:28,620
the oppressors in toto without any 
consideration whatsoever for reactionary

302
00:22:29,351 --> 00:22:34,351
niceties such as individual innocence.
Let us note as well this outcome wasn't 

303
00:22:35,861 --> 00:22:40,120
the result of the initially pristine 
Marxist doctrine becoming corrupted over

304
00:22:40,121 --> 00:22:45,121
time,
but something apparent and present at 

305
00:22:45,121 --> 00:22:45,121
the very beginning of the Soviet state 
itself.

306
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:47,380
Sojourn,
it's insights.

307
00:22:47,381 --> 00:22:48,400
For example,
one,

308
00:22:48,401 --> 00:22:53,401
Martin lapsis writing for the newspaper 
read terror November first 1918.

309
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:59,830
We are not fighting against single 
individuals.

310
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,580
We are exterminating the bourgeoisie as 
a class.

311
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:10,050
It is not necessary during the 
interrogation to look for evidence 

312
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:12,820
proving that the accused opposed the 
Soviets by word or action.

313
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:15,370
The first question you should ask him 
is,

314
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:18,970
what class does he belong to?
What is his origin,

315
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:21,490
his education,
and his profession?

316
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:26,880
These are the questions that will 
determine the fate of the accused such 

317
00:23:27,161 --> 00:23:30,310
as the sense an essence of red terror.

318
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:37,590
It is necessary to think when you read 
such a thing to meditate long and hard 

319
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,850
on the message,
it is necessary to recognize,

320
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:44,851
for example,
that the writer believed that it would 

321
00:23:44,851 --> 00:23:46,951
be better to execute 10,000
potentially innocent individuals than to

322
00:23:46,971 --> 00:23:51,971
allow one poisonous member of the 
oppressor class to remain free is 

323
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:58,541
equally necessary.
To pose the question who precisely 

324
00:23:58,821 --> 00:24:02,900
belonged to that hypothetical entity,
the bourgeoisie.

325
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:08,850
It is not as if the boundaries of such a
category or self evident there for the 

326
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:12,971
mere perceiving they must be drawn,
but where exactly and more importantly 

327
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:20,800
by whom or by what if it's hate 
inscribing the lines instead of love,

328
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:25,340
they will inevitably be drawn so that 
the lowest,

329
00:24:25,341 --> 00:24:29,180
meanest,
most cruel and useless of the conceptual

330
00:24:29,181 --> 00:24:34,181
geographers will be justified in 
manifesting the greatest possible evil 

331
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:39,160
and producing the greatest possible 
misery members of the Swazi beyond all 

332
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:45,280
redemption.
They had to go as a matter of course,

333
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:48,910
one of their wives,
children,

334
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:55,350
even their grandchildren,
off with their heads to all were 

335
00:24:56,621 --> 00:25:00,610
encouraged to be corrupted by their 
class identity and their destruction.

336
00:25:00,611 --> 00:25:05,611
Therefore ethically necessitated.
How convenient that the darkest and 

337
00:25:06,041 --> 00:25:08,890
diarist of all possible motivations 
could be granted,

338
00:25:08,891 --> 00:25:13,891
the highest of moral standings that was 
a true marriage of Hell and heaven.

339
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:18,430
What values?
What philosophical presumptions,

340
00:25:18,431 --> 00:25:23,431
truly dominated under such circumstances
was it desire for brotherhood,

341
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:28,480
dignity and freedom from want?
Not In the least,

342
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:35,030
not given the outcome.
It was instead and obviously the 

343
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:39,321
murderous rage of hundreds of thousands 
of biblical canes each looking to 

344
00:25:39,691 --> 00:25:41,220
torture,
destroy,

345
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:46,280
and sacrifice their own private ables.
There is simply no other manner of 

346
00:25:47,311 --> 00:25:52,311
accounting for the corpses.
What can be concluded in the deepest,

347
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:56,070
most permanent sense from Solzhenitsyn's
anguished,

348
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,980
ghoulag narrative.
First,

349
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:04,230
we learn what is indisputable,
what we all should have learned by now,

350
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:09,470
what we have nonetheless failed to learn
that the left like the right can go too 

351
00:26:11,161 --> 00:26:13,650
far,
that the left has in the past,

352
00:26:13,651 --> 00:26:16,950
gone much too far.
Second,

353
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,710
we learn what is far more subtle and 
difficult.

354
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:24,980
How and why that going too far occurs.
We learn as social units and so 

355
00:26:25,561 --> 00:26:30,561
profoundly insists that the line 
dividing good and evil cuts through the 

356
00:26:30,561 --> 00:26:35,241
heart of every human being,
and we learned as well that we all are 

357
00:26:35,241 --> 00:26:36,230
each of us,
Cymbalta,

358
00:26:36,231 --> 00:26:39,210
caneously,
oppressor and oppressed.

359
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:45,410
Thus,
we come to realize that the twin 

360
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:47,151
categories of or presser and justice 
seeking victim can be made endlessly 

361
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:52,290
inclusive.
This is not least because we all benefit

362
00:26:52,291 --> 00:26:57,291
unfairly and are all equally victimized 
by our thrownness are arbitrary 

363
00:26:58,561 --> 00:27:03,561
placement in the flow of time.
We all accrue undeserved and somewhat 

364
00:27:03,601 --> 00:27:08,220
random privileged from the vagaries of 
our place of birth or inequitably,

365
00:27:08,221 --> 00:27:10,620
distributed talents,
our ethnicity,

366
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,060
race,
culture,

367
00:27:12,061 --> 00:27:14,970
and sex.
We all belong to a group,

368
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:20,060
some group that has been elevated and 
comparative status through no effort of 

369
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:24,561
our own.
This is true in some manner along some 

370
00:27:24,561 --> 00:27:28,251
dimension of group category for every 
solitary individual except for the 

371
00:27:29,171 --> 00:27:34,171
single most lowly of all at some time 
and in some manner we may all in 

372
00:27:34,681 --> 00:27:39,681
consequence be justly targeted as 
oppressors and may all equally seek 

373
00:27:40,021 --> 00:27:45,021
justice or revenge as victims even if 
the initiators of the revolution had 

374
00:27:47,521 --> 00:27:52,521
therefore in their most pure moments 
being driven by a holy desire to lift up

375
00:27:52,741 --> 00:27:56,690
the downtrodden,
was it not guaranteed that they would be

376
00:27:56,691 --> 00:28:00,380
overtaken by those motivated primarily 
by envy,

377
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:04,910
hate and the desire to destroy.
As the revolution progressed,

378
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:11,410
hence the establishment of the hungrily 
growing and most often fatal list of 

379
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:15,080
class enemies right from the very first 
moments of the communist revolution.

380
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,710
The demolition was aimed first at the 
students,

381
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:23,740
the religious believers and the 
socialists continuing under Stalin with 

382
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:26,720
the old revolutionaries themselves and 
was followed.

383
00:28:26,721 --> 00:28:31,721
Soon thereafter,
by the annihilation of the successful 

384
00:28:31,721 --> 00:28:31,940
peasant farmer Kulaks

385
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:39,380
and this appetite for destruction wasn't
of the type to be satiated with the 

386
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:43,191
bodies of the perpetrators themselves as
social needs and rights,

387
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:49,460
they burned out hold nests whole 
families from the start and they watched

388
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:52,290
jealously to be sure that none of the 
children,

389
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:54,450
14,
10,

390
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,720
even six years old,
God away to the last scrapings all had 

391
00:29:00,511 --> 00:29:04,410
to go down the same road to the same 
common destruction.

392
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:10,910
This was driven by the perceived even 
self perceived guilt of all how else was

393
00:29:12,601 --> 00:29:17,601
it possible for the hundreds of 
thousands or perhaps even millions of 

394
00:29:17,601 --> 00:29:18,630
informants,
prosecutors,

395
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:23,810
betrayers and unforgivably,
mute observers to praying and 

396
00:29:25,051 --> 00:29:30,051
unforgivably mute observers to spring so
rapidly into being in the tumult of the 

397
00:29:31,501 --> 00:29:32,460
red terror.

398
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:40,150
Thus the doctrine of group identity 
inevitably ends with everyone identified

399
00:29:40,761 --> 00:29:45,761
as a class enemy,
an oppressor with everyone unpleasantly 

400
00:29:45,761 --> 00:29:49,180
contaminated by bridgewater.
Privilege unfairly enjoying the benefits

401
00:29:49,181 --> 00:29:54,181
be queen by the vagaries of history with
everyone prosecuted without respite for 

402
00:29:55,271 --> 00:30:00,271
that corruption and injustice,
no mercy for the oppressor and no 

403
00:30:01,811 --> 00:30:06,811
punishment.
Too severe for the crime of 

404
00:30:06,811 --> 00:30:09,091
exploitation.
Expiation becomes impossible because 

405
00:30:09,091 --> 00:30:12,100
there is no individual guilt,
no individual responsibility,

406
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:17,460
and therefore no manner in which the 
crime of arbitrary birth can be 

407
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:21,811
individually accounted for and all the 
misery that can be generated as a 

408
00:30:21,941 --> 00:30:26,941
consequence of such an accusation is the
true reason for the accusation.

409
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:34,560
When everyone is guilty,
all that serves justice is the 

410
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:38,461
punishment of everyone.
When the guilt extends to the existence 

411
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:42,781
of the world's misery itself,
only the fatal punishment will suffice.

412
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:51,390
It is much more preferable instead and 
much more likely to preserve us all from

413
00:30:52,091 --> 00:30:56,170
metastasizing hell's to state 
forthrightly.

414
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:00,640
I am indeed throwing arbitrarily into 
history.

415
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:06,860
I therefore choose to voluntarily 
shoulder the responsibility of my 

416
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:09,340
advantages and the burden of my 
disadvantages.

417
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:14,940
Like every other individual,
I am morally bound to pay for my 

418
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:18,050
advantages with my responsibility.
All right,

419
00:31:18,051 --> 00:31:22,420
morally bound to accept my disadvantages
as the price I pay for being.

420
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:29,070
I will therefore strive not to descend 
into bitterness and then seek vengeance 

421
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:34,560
because I have less to my credit and a 
greater burden to stumble forward with 

422
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,140
than others.

423
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:42,890
Is this not an a or even the essential 
point of difference between the West for

424
00:31:43,081 --> 00:31:48,081
all its faults and the brutal,
terrible egalitarian systems generated 

425
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:53,180
by the pathological communist doctrine?
The great and good framers of the 

426
00:31:53,791 --> 00:31:56,100
American republic were,
for example,

427
00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:00,840
anything but utopian.
They took full stock and full measure of

428
00:32:00,841 --> 00:32:05,841
ineradicable human imperfection.
They held modest goals derived not least

429
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,530
from the profoundly cautious common law 
tradition of England.

430
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:16,700
They endeavored to establish a system 
the corrupt and ignorant fools we all 

431
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:19,050
are,
could not damage to fatally.

432
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:24,950
That's humility,
that's clear headed knowledge of the 

433
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:27,510
limitations of human machination and 
good intention,

434
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:32,880
but the communists,
the revolutionaries,

435
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:38,570
they aimed grandly and admirably,
at least in theory at a more heavenly 

436
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:45,191
vision,
and they began their pursuit with a 

437
00:32:45,191 --> 00:32:47,951
hypothetically straightforward and oh,
so morally justifiable enforcement of 

438
00:32:49,131 --> 00:32:52,220
economic equality.
Wealth,

439
00:32:52,221 --> 00:32:54,860
however,
was not so easily generated.

440
00:32:55,310 --> 00:33:00,310
The poor could not simply become rich,
but the riches of those who had anything

441
00:33:00,381 --> 00:33:05,210
more than the greatest popper,
no matter how pitiful that more was,

442
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:10,010
that could be redistributed or at least 
destroyed.

443
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:16,400
That's equality to that sacrifice in the
name of heaven on earth and 

444
00:33:17,911 --> 00:33:21,150
redistribution was not enough.
With all its theft,

445
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:22,710
betrayal,
and death.

446
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:26,520
Mere economic engineering was 
insufficient.

447
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:32,540
What emerged as well was the overarching
and truly totalitarian desire to remake 

448
00:33:33,451 --> 00:33:35,550
man and woman.
As such,

449
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:41,180
the longing to restructure the human 
spirit in the very image of the 

450
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:45,231
communist preconceptions,
attributing to themselves this divine 

451
00:33:45,421 --> 00:33:47,730
ability,
this transcendent wisdom,

452
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:52,890
and with unshakeable belief in the 
glowing but ever receiving future.

453
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:56,400
The newly minted Soviets tortured 
thieved,

454
00:33:56,550 --> 00:34:01,550
imprisoned,
lied and betrayed all the wild masking 

455
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:04,630
their great evil with virtue,
it was Solzhenitsyn,

456
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:09,650
the Gulag archipelago that tore off the 
mask and exposed the feral cowardice,

457
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:11,820
envy,
deceit,

458
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:17,090
resentment,
and hatred for the individual and for 

459
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:20,151
existence itself.
That pulse beneath others had made the 

460
00:34:21,921 --> 00:34:26,921
attempt.
Malcolm Muggeridge reported on the 

461
00:34:26,921 --> 00:34:29,651
horrors of d Kula Ization,
the forced collectivization of the all 

462
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:33,950
too recently successful peasantry of the
Ukraine and elsewhere that proceeded the

463
00:34:33,951 --> 00:34:38,951
horrifying famines of the 19 thirties in
the same decade and in the following 

464
00:34:39,891 --> 00:34:44,891
years.
George orwell risked his ideological 

465
00:34:44,891 --> 00:34:47,591
commitments and his reputation to tell 
us all what was truly occurring in the 

466
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:50,750
Soviet Union in the name of 
egalitarianism and brotherhood,

467
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:55,870
but it was Solzhenitsyn who truly shamed
the radical leftists,

468
00:34:55,930 --> 00:35:00,930
forcing them under ground where they 
have festered and plotted for the last 

469
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:05,161
40 years,
failing unforgivably to have learned 

470
00:35:05,161 --> 00:35:08,521
what all reasonable people should have 
learned from the cataclysm of the 20th 

471
00:35:08,521 --> 00:35:10,600
century and it's Egalitarian,
utopianism,

472
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:16,030
and today,
despite everything and under their sway,

473
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:21,270
almost three decades since the fall of 
the Berlin Wall and the apparent 

474
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:24,931
collapse of communism.
We're doing everything we can to forget 

475
00:35:24,931 --> 00:35:28,591
what Solzhenitsyn so clearly 
demonstrated to our great and richly 

476
00:35:28,591 --> 00:35:33,091
deserved peril.
Why don't all our children read the 

477
00:35:33,091 --> 00:35:36,790
Gulag archipelago in our high schools as
they now do in Russia?

478
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:41,820
Why don't our teachers feel compelled to
read the book aloud?

479
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:48,080
Did we not win the Cold War?
Where the body's not piled high enough,

480
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:54,500
how high then would be enough?
Why,

481
00:35:55,380 --> 00:36:00,380
for example,
is it still acceptable end in polite 

482
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:04,011
company to profess the philosophy of a 
communist or if not that to at least 

483
00:36:04,011 --> 00:36:08,040
admire the work of Marx.
Why is it still acceptable to regard the

484
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:13,041
Marxist doctrine as essentially accurate
in its diagnosis of the hypothetical 

485
00:36:13,041 --> 00:36:15,390
evils of the free market democratic 
west,

486
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:20,840
to still consider that doctrine 
progressive and fit for the 

487
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,080
Compassionate and proper thinking person

488
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:28,580
$25 million dead through internal 
repression in the Soviet Union.

489
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:31,280
According to the black book of 
communism,

490
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:36,490
$60 million dead in Mao's,
China and an all too likely return to 

491
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:38,810
audit craddick oppression in that 
country in the near future.

492
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:44,560
The horrors of Cambodian killing fields 
with their 2 million corpses,

493
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:50,320
the barely animate body politic of Cuba 
where people struggle even now to feed 

494
00:36:50,931 --> 00:36:55,931
themselves Venezuela where it is now 
been made illegal to attribute a child's

495
00:36:57,951 --> 00:37:02,951
death in hospital to starvation.
No political experiment has ever been 

496
00:37:04,951 --> 00:37:09,951
tried so widely with so many disparate 
people in so many different countries 

497
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:15,500
with such different histories and failed
so absolutely and catastrophic.

498
00:37:15,841 --> 00:37:19,050
Lee,
is it mere ignorance?

499
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:24,480
I'll be at of the most inexcusable kind 
that allows today's Marxists to flaunt 

500
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:29,310
their continued allegiance to present it
as compassion and care,

501
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:35,540
or is it instead envy of the successful 
in near infinite proportions or 

502
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:41,100
something akin to hatred for mankind 
itself?

503
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:47,800
How much proof do we need?
Why do we still avert our eyes from the 

504
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:52,721
truth?
Perhaps we simply locked sophistication.

505
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:59,270
Perhaps we just can't understand.
Perhaps our tendency toward compassion 

506
00:37:59,341 --> 00:38:03,390
is so powerfully necessary in the 
intimacy of our families and friendships

507
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:06,150
that we cannot contemplate its 
limitations.

508
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:11,270
It's an ability to scale and its 
propensity to mutate into hatred of the 

509
00:38:11,491 --> 00:38:14,730
oppressor rather than an allegiance with
the oppressed.

510
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:21,290
Perhaps we cannot comprehend the 
limitations and dangers of the Utopian 

511
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:25,221
vision given our definite need to 
contemplate and to strive for a better 

512
00:38:25,441 --> 00:38:26,100
tomorrow.

513
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:30,030
We certainly don't seem to imagine,
for example,

514
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:33,630
that the hypothesis of some state of 
future perfection,

515
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:38,960
for example,
the truly egalitarian and permanent 

516
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,851
brotherhood of man can be used to 
justify any and all sacrifices 

517
00:38:41,851 --> 00:38:44,980
whatsoever.
The pristine and heavenly end,

518
00:38:44,981 --> 00:38:49,900
making all conceivable means no one only
acceptable but morally required.

519
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:55,390
There are simply no price too great to 
pay in pursuit of the ultimate utopia,

520
00:38:55,750 --> 00:39:00,750
and this is particularly true if it is 
someone else who foots the bill and it 

521
00:39:01,851 --> 00:39:06,851
is clearly the case that we require a 
future toward which to orient ourselves 

522
00:39:06,851 --> 00:39:09,890
to provide meaning in our life 
psychologically speaking.

523
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:17,230
It is for that reason.
We see the same need expressed 

524
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:20,020
collectively on a much larger scale in 
the Judeo Christian vision of the 

525
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,640
Promised Land and the Kingdom of Heaven 
on earth,

526
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:27,970
and it is also clearly the case.
That sacrifice is necessary to bring 

527
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:31,811
that desire to instate into being.
That's the discovery of the future 

528
00:39:31,811 --> 00:39:36,461
itself,
the necessity to forego instantaneous 

529
00:39:36,461 --> 00:39:37,550
gratification in the present,
to delay,

530
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:42,850
to bargain with fate so the future can 
be better twinned with the necessity to 

531
00:39:42,921 --> 00:39:45,110
let go,
to burn off,

532
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:50,410
to separate wheat from chaff and to 
sacrifice what is presently unworthy so 

533
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:55,061
that tomorrow can be better than today,
but limits need to be placed around who 

534
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,000
or what is deemed dispensable.
And it is exactly the necessity for 

535
00:40:01,851 --> 00:40:06,851
interminable sacrifice that constitutes 
the terrible counterpart of the Utopian 

536
00:40:06,851 --> 00:40:09,530
vision.
Heaven is worth any price,

537
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:15,600
but who pays Christianity solve that 
problem by insisting on the sacrifice of

538
00:40:16,241 --> 00:40:21,241
the self,
insisting that the suffering and 

539
00:40:21,241 --> 00:40:24,151
malevolence of the world is the 
responsibility of each individual 

540
00:40:24,151 --> 00:40:28,770
insisting that each of us sacrifice what
is unworthy and unnecessary and 

541
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:33,451
resentful and deadly and our characters 
despite the pain of such sacrifice so 

542
00:40:34,121 --> 00:40:39,121
that we can stumble properly uphill 
under our respective and voluntarily 

543
00:40:39,121 --> 00:40:43,801
shouldered existential burdens,
but it was an is the opinion of the 

544
00:40:44,081 --> 00:40:49,081
materialist utopians that someone else 
be sacrificed so that heaven itself 

545
00:40:49,081 --> 00:40:53,050
might be attained,
some perpetrator or victimizer,

546
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,530
oral oppressor or member of a privileged
group.

547
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,610
A cynic might be forgiven in consequence
for asking,

548
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:05,890
is it the city of God that is in fact 
the aim or is the true aim?

549
00:41:05,891 --> 00:41:10,891
The desire to make a burning sacrificial
pyre of everyone and everything and the 

550
00:41:10,891 --> 00:41:13,390
hypothesis of the coming brotherhood of 
man.

551
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:18,570
Merely the cover story,
the camouflage perhaps it is precisely 

552
00:41:18,971 --> 00:41:21,820
the horror that is the point and not the
utopia.

553
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,420
It is far from obvious in such 
situations.

554
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:30,630
Just what his horse and what his cart it
is precisely in the aftermath of the 

555
00:41:30,731 --> 00:41:35,731
death of 100 million people or more that
such dark questions must be asked and we

556
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:41,861
should also note that the Utopian vision
dressed as it is inevitably in 

557
00:41:41,861 --> 00:41:43,370
compassion,
is a temptation,

558
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:46,110
particularly difficult to resist and 
bay.

559
00:41:46,111 --> 00:41:51,111
Therefore offer a particularly subtle 
and insidious justification for mayhem.

560
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:56,890
Here's some thoughts.
Know some facts.

561
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:02,880
Every social system produces inequality 
at present and every social system has 

562
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:07,831
done so since the beginning of time.
The poor have been with us and will be 

563
00:42:08,681 --> 00:42:13,480
with us always and now let's just have 
the content of individual.

564
00:42:13,481 --> 00:42:18,481
Paleolithic grave sites provides 
evidence for the existence of 

565
00:42:18,481 --> 00:42:20,530
substantive variance in the distribution
of ability,

566
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:22,150
privilege,
and wealth.

567
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:27,450
Even in our distant past.
The more illustrious of our ancestors 

568
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:31,360
were buried with great possessions,
hordes of precious metals,

569
00:42:31,361 --> 00:42:32,950
weaponry,
jewelry,

570
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,560
and costuming.
The majority,

571
00:42:35,561 --> 00:42:40,561
however,
struggled through their lives and were 

572
00:42:40,561 --> 00:42:42,040
buried with nothing.
Inequality is the iron rule,

573
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:45,340
even among animals with their intense 
competition,

574
00:42:45,341 --> 00:42:48,790
for quality living,
space and reproductive opportunity,

575
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:53,890
even among plants and cities.
Even among the stellar lights,

576
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,920
the doc,
the cosmos themselves were a minority of

577
00:42:56,921 --> 00:43:01,921
privileged and oppressive heavenly 
bodies contained in the mass and 

578
00:43:01,921 --> 00:43:05,131
thousands,
millions or even billions of average 

579
00:43:05,131 --> 00:43:08,941
dispossessed planets.
Inequality is the deepest of problems 

580
00:43:08,941 --> 00:43:13,350
built into the structure of reality 
itself and will not be solved by the 

581
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:17,551
presumptuous ibiology inspired retooling
of the rare free,

582
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,590
stable and productive democracies of the
world.

583
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:26,940
The only systems that have produced some
modicum of wealth along with the 

584
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:31,051
inevitable inequality and it's 
intendance along with the inevitable 

585
00:43:31,061 --> 00:43:33,370
inequality and its attendant suffering,

586
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:40,610
the only systems that have produced some
modicum of wealth along with the 

587
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:44,691
inevitable inequality and its attendant 
suffering or those that evolved in the 

588
00:43:44,691 --> 00:43:47,100
west with their roots in the Judeo 
Christian tradition.

589
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:51,540
Precisely those systems that emphasize 
above all the essential dignity,

590
00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:56,690
divinity,
and ultimate responsibility of the 

591
00:43:56,690 --> 00:43:57,240
individual.
In consequence,

592
00:43:57,241 --> 00:44:02,241
any attempt to attribute the existence 
of inequality to the functioning of the 

593
00:44:02,241 --> 00:44:04,860
productive institutions.
We have managed to create and protect so

594
00:44:04,861 --> 00:44:09,861
recently in what is still accurately 
regarded as the free world will hurt 

595
00:44:09,861 --> 00:44:11,760
those who are weakest and most 
vulnerable.

596
00:44:11,761 --> 00:44:15,390
First,
the radicals who conflate the activities

597
00:44:15,391 --> 00:44:18,120
of the west with the oppression of the 
downtrodden,

598
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:23,010
therefore do nothing to aid those whom 
they purport to prize and plenty to harm

599
00:44:23,011 --> 00:44:28,011
them.
The claims they make to act under the 

600
00:44:28,011 --> 00:44:30,891
inspiration of pure compassion must 
therefore come to be regarded with the 

601
00:44:30,891 --> 00:44:34,050
deepest suspicion,
not least by those who dare to make such

602
00:44:34,051 --> 00:44:35,850
claims themselves.

603
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:41,640
The dangers of the Utopian vision had 
been laid bare even if the reasons those

604
00:44:41,641 --> 00:44:45,360
dangers exist have not yet been fully 
unacceptably articulated.

605
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:50,900
If there was any excuse to be a marxist 
in 1917 and both Dostoevsky and nichier 

606
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:56,280
prophesied well before then that there 
would be held to pay for that doctrine.

607
00:44:56,490 --> 00:45:01,490
There is absolutely and finally no 
excuse now and we know that mostly 

608
00:45:01,801 --> 00:45:05,520
because of Alexander Solzhenitsyn and 
the Gulag archipelago.

609
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:09,450
Thank heaven for that great authors,
outrage,

610
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:13,380
courage and unquenchable thirst for 
justice and truth.

611
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:19,340
It was Solzhenitsyn who warned us that 
the catastrophes of the Soviet state 

612
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:23,510
were inextricably and causally linked to
the deceitful blandishments of the 

613
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:30,200
Marxist Utopian Vision.
It was Solzhenitsyn who carefully 

614
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:33,090
documented the price paid in suffering 
for the dreadful communist experiment.

615
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:37,590
And who distilled from that suffering 
the wisdom we must all he'd so that such

616
00:45:37,591 --> 00:45:39,840
catastrophe does not visit us again.

617
00:45:41,470 --> 00:45:46,470
Perhaps we could take from his writing 
the humility that would allow us to 

618
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:50,551
understand that our mere good intentions
are not sufficient to make us good men 

619
00:45:50,651 --> 00:45:55,651
and women.
Perhaps we could take from his writing 

620
00:45:55,651 --> 00:45:59,430
the humility that would allow us to 
understand that our mere good intentions

621
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:02,980
are not sufficient to make us good men 
and women.

622
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:08,460
Perhaps we could come to understand that
such intentions are instead all too 

623
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:12,601
often,
the consequence of our unpardonable 

624
00:46:12,601 --> 00:46:15,541
historical ignorance are author,
willful blindness and are voracious 

625
00:46:15,541 --> 00:46:19,360
hidden appetite for vengeance,
terror and destruction.

626
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:25,380
Perhaps we could come to remember and to
learn from the intolerable trials 

627
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:29,640
endeared by all those who pass through 
the fiery chambers of the Marxists 

628
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:30,160
collectivists ideology.

629
00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:36,710
Perhaps we could derive from that 
remembering and learning the wisdom 

630
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:40,971
necessary to take personal 
responsibility for the suffering and 

631
00:46:40,971 --> 00:46:44,991
malevolence that still so terribly and 
unforgivably characterizes the world.

632
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:51,440
We have been provided with the means to 
transform ourselves in due humility by 

633
00:46:52,501 --> 00:46:56,130
the literary and moral genius of this 
great Russian author.

634
00:46:56,820 --> 00:47:01,820
We should also pray most devoutly to 
whatever dad he guides us implicitly or 

635
00:47:02,101 --> 00:47:07,101
explicitly for the desire and the will 
to learn from what we have been offered.

636
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:12,800
May God himself eternally fail to 
forgive us if in the painstakingly 

637
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:16,080
revealed aftermath of such bloodshed,
torture,

638
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:18,900
and anguish,
we remain stiff,

639
00:47:18,901 --> 00:47:22,800
necked in cautious and unchanged.
