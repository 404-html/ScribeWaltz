1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,430
Give him a warm welcome Dr Jordan b 
Peterson.

2
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:11,830
Thank you.

3
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:36,040
Thank you very much.
It's very nice to be here and to see you

4
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:41,041
all come out to spend a couple of hours 
thinking about difficult things.

5
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:50,080
There seems to be an appetite for that,
which is really something.

6
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:55,890
So let's exploit it.
So I started working on the ideas that I

7
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:05,520
outlined in 12 rules for life while a 
long time ago and really started when I 

8
00:01:06,791 --> 00:01:11,791
was about 13.
I was a junior high school student and 

9
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:17,370
um,
I met this librarian who's kind of an 

10
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:22,590
eccentric person,
very well educated person and she,

11
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:28,600
we are used to hang around with my 
delinquent friends in the library,

12
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:33,870
which tells you how eccentric the 
librarian was because that's not 

13
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,860
normally the place where the delinquent 
kids hang out,

14
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:39,100
you know.
But she talked to us like we were adults

15
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,000
and that was,
what would you call it?

16
00:01:43,001 --> 00:01:43,840
A refreshing.

17
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:49,290
That was a refreshing experience.
And she knew that I liked to read and 

18
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:57,180
she started giving me real books.
She gave me one day in the life of Ivan 

19
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,340
Denisovich,
which was the first book published by Al

20
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,350
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn in the Soviet 
Union,

21
00:02:04,351 --> 00:02:07,930
and it's a story about the day of a 
political prisoner in a,

22
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:11,230
in a,
in a work camp and brave new world,

23
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:16,210
and 1984 and animal farm and Ayn rand's 
books,

24
00:02:16,211 --> 00:02:21,160
which was quite interesting because she 
was the wife of our member of parliament

25
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,760
who was the only member of the 
opposition in our province and he was a 

26
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,961
socialist,
an NDP new Democratic Party leader as a 

27
00:02:30,961 --> 00:02:30,961
matter of fact.
And,

28
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:34,930
but despite that,
she gave me Ayn rand's books because she

29
00:02:34,931 --> 00:02:38,830
thought that I should be exposed to the 
other side of the argument.

30
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,950
So I read atlas shrugged and,
um,

31
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:48,090
the fountain head and well,
she was the first person who helped me 

32
00:02:49,301 --> 00:02:51,760
discover literature,
let's say.

33
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,560
And while at the same time I got 
interested in what had happened in Nazi 

34
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:05,340
Germany.
And I wrote an essay about that when I 

35
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,280
was about 13 or 14 about Auschwitz and 
what had happened there.

36
00:03:06,281 --> 00:03:09,820
And I never read that really never left 
my mind.

37
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:14,880
I would say I think I read Viktor 
Frankl's man's search for meaning at 

38
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,081
that point,
which is a book I would highly 

39
00:03:19,081 --> 00:03:20,821
recommend.
I have a reading list on my website by 

40
00:03:20,821 --> 00:03:23,461
the way at Jordan Peterson Dotcom,
and so there's a variety of books there 

41
00:03:23,461 --> 00:03:27,541
that have really influenced me and I put
them up for other people's use anyways.

42
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:35,240
I never what what I learned about 
Auschwitz and about Nazi Germany never 

43
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:39,661
really left my mind and because I 
couldn't understand how people could act

44
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:45,030
that way,
how they could not only be possessed by 

45
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:48,061
an ideology to the degree that the 
Germans were very civilized country 

46
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:48,340
Germany,
you know,

47
00:03:48,341 --> 00:03:53,341
so it was I suppose even more 
spectacular shock that something so 

48
00:03:53,341 --> 00:03:58,111
catastrophic happened there,
but it wasn't just the ideological 

49
00:03:58,111 --> 00:03:58,111
possession.

50
00:03:58,111 --> 00:04:01,740
It was the cruelty and the gratuitous 
cruelty in the service of that 

51
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,860
ideological possession that I couldn't 
understand.

52
00:04:02,861 --> 00:04:07,861
It didn't.
I couldn't establish a relationship 

53
00:04:07,861 --> 00:04:09,460
between my own being and those patterns 
of action.

54
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:15,570
And as I got older,
that concern transformed itself into an 

55
00:04:16,691 --> 00:04:21,691
obsession.
I would say not so much with what had 

56
00:04:21,691 --> 00:04:24,100
happened in Nazi Germany,
but with I think what happened,

57
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:29,380
what was happening as a consequence of 
the collectivist philosophy per se,

58
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:34,860
which you might think of something that 
manifested itself both on the right in 

59
00:04:34,901 --> 00:04:39,901
Nazi Germany and then on the left in all
the multitudinous and catastrophic 

60
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:45,540
communist regimes that characterized the
bulk of the 20th century and they're 

61
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:51,661
insane murderousness and that probably 
culminated for me in the 19 seventies 

62
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:56,560
when I Read Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's 
Gulag archipelago,

63
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:01,680
which is another book that everyone 
should read because in some sense it 

64
00:05:01,721 --> 00:05:06,721
might be the defining document of the 
20th century and the fact that everyone 

65
00:05:06,721 --> 00:05:11,670
in the West isn't familiar with that 
book is actually a signal of our 

66
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,630
catastrophic moral failing.
I would say.

67
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:19,280
Um,
I started writing this book called maps 

68
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,140
of meaning in about 1985,
although it had been working on variance

69
00:05:23,141 --> 00:05:28,141
of it before that.
And what I was trying to understand was 

70
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:34,600
maybe the psychological motivations for 
the Cold War.

71
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:35,770
Something like that.

72
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,960
Many of you are old enough to remember 
what it was like in the 19 eighties.

73
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:46,140
We just went and visited the house in in
Reykjavik where Gorbachev and Reagan 

74
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,960
met,
which was quite something to see and 

75
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,391
when they decided they were going to 
bring at least some of the insanity to 

76
00:05:54,391 --> 00:05:55,300
irrelative Hallt,
thank God,

77
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,950
and the eighties were a very contentious
time.

78
00:05:57,951 --> 00:06:02,951
You know,
the Cold War sort of peaked in two at 

79
00:06:02,951 --> 00:06:05,501
two times.
That peaked in 1962 during the Cuban 

80
00:06:05,501 --> 00:06:06,140
missile crisis.
I don't know if you know this,

81
00:06:06,141 --> 00:06:11,141
but when I visited a,
a nuclear missile site in Arizona about 

82
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,880
10 years ago,
it was a decommissioned missile site,

83
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:21,970
intercontinental ballistic missile.
Intercontinental ballistic missile is a 

84
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:24,470
very large rockets and can go halfway 
around the world and its ballistic,

85
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:30,070
which means it has the same function as 
a bullet and the bullet is ballistic 

86
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:30,590
because once you fire it,
it's gone.

87
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:33,050
You don't control it after it.
It leaves.

88
00:06:33,051 --> 00:06:36,440
So once you launch a ballistic missile,
it's launched,

89
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:41,470
there's no calling it back.
And they told us they did a simulation 

90
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:42,020
launch,
which was very eerie thing.

91
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:45,530
And so to launch a nuclear missile is a 
big console.

92
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,560
It sort of looks like the star Trek 
control a control module,

93
00:06:52,881 --> 00:06:57,881
let's say,
and one person stands here and one 

94
00:06:57,881 --> 00:07:01,271
person stands about 20 feet away,
each have a key around their neck and 

95
00:07:01,271 --> 00:07:05,710
they put the key in the lock 
simultaneously and then turn it for 10 

96
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:09,281
seconds and at the end of 10 seconds the
missile is gone and that's that and they

97
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:15,221
both had their keys in the lock in 1962,
so and we came close again in 1984 when,

98
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:21,700
I don't know if you know this,
but the Soviet missile detection system 

99
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:26,660
signal the launch of four or five 
missiles from North America and a single

100
00:07:26,661 --> 00:07:31,661
Russian soldier decided that it was a 
false alarm and refused to push the 

101
00:07:34,431 --> 00:07:38,720
button would have resulted in major 
retaliation.

102
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:42,140
He just died about a year ago.
You can read about him on wikipedia.

103
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:47,650
Anyways,
I read Solzhenitsyn in 1976 and that 

104
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:52,960
made me,
me even I would say more obsessed with 

105
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,930
what was happening in,
in on the world stage.

106
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:59,050
I was trying to understand why it was 
that the systems of belief that we 

107
00:07:59,961 --> 00:08:04,961
inhabited.
Let's say one typifying the Soviet 

108
00:08:04,961 --> 00:08:05,540
Union,
and in similar states,

109
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:06,680
Mao's,
China,

110
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:11,890
North Korea,
wonderful places like that versus the 

111
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:16,571
West.
We each had our own way of construing 

112
00:08:16,571 --> 00:08:19,541
the world,
the ways of construing the world were 

113
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:22,580
set at odds with one another and the 
fact that they were set at odds with one

114
00:08:22,581 --> 00:08:27,581
another appeared to be so significant 
that we've armed ourselves with 50,000

115
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:36,360
harder hydrogen bombs on each side.
Something like that.

116
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,700
And I don't know how much you knew about
a hydrogen bomb.

117
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,530
You know,
you know about atomic bombs,

118
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:44,670
you know that a hydrogen bomb has an 
atomic bomb for the trigger.

119
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,760
Right?
So,

120
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:50,370
so like the atom bomb that was dropped 
on Hiroshima,

121
00:08:50,371 --> 00:08:52,890
that was something that was a fission 
bomb,

122
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:55,500
not standard atomic bomb,
the first generation,

123
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:00,800
but hydrogen bomb is incontestably more 
powerful than that.

124
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:05,640
And we were producing them in the tens 
of thousands.

125
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:10,670
It's not like we don't have any now,
but it was really some insanity in the 

126
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:15,000
19 eighties and people seem to have a 
very itchy trigger finger.

127
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:18,510
So I was very confused about this in two
ways.

128
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:24,050
One from a psychological perspective,
because by that time I just started 

129
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:25,290
decided to study psychology instead of 
political science,

130
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:28,980
which was my original major.
I get,

131
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:34,070
I got disenchanted with political 
science because I didn't believe that 

132
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,010
people were fundamentally motivated by 
economic issues.

133
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:40,040
I still don't believe that that's true.
They're motivated by whatever they're 

134
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,460
motivated by.
It can't be captured by economics,

135
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:46,840
not not precisely.
It was very curious about what it was 

136
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:51,231
that was so important about a belief 
system that people would risk putting 

137
00:09:51,301 --> 00:09:56,301
the entire planet to the torch to ensure
that their particular motive construing 

138
00:09:56,941 --> 00:10:00,480
the world prevailed is an interesting 
psychological problem.

139
00:10:00,481 --> 00:10:05,481
What was so important about belief 
system that would justify destroying 

140
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:06,270
everything,
let's say,

141
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:11,280
or risking destroying everything because
that was certainly the situation we put 

142
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:11,280
ourselves in

143
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:22,900
and more to the point of I guess,
or equally to the point I was interested

144
00:10:22,901 --> 00:10:24,430
in two other things.
One was

145
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,950
were these differences in belief 
systems?

146
00:10:28,951 --> 00:10:33,951
Just arbitrary,
and that's actually a postmodern 

147
00:10:33,951 --> 00:10:36,801
question.
I didn't know that at the time now 

148
00:10:36,801 --> 00:10:39,531
because you might say the postmodernists
do say there's a very large number of 

149
00:10:39,531 --> 00:10:43,071
ways of interpreting the world and it 
isn't obvious how you determine which of

150
00:10:43,501 --> 00:10:47,520
those ways are correct and so perhaps 
you can't determine that any of them are

151
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:52,521
correct and then as a consequence of 
your inability to determine if any of 

152
00:10:52,521 --> 00:10:57,111
them are correct,
then you have to turn to something like 

153
00:10:57,111 --> 00:11:00,170
power dispute to establish which 
interpretation is going to take 

154
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:03,300
precedence.
And I would say in a nutshell,

155
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:08,570
that's a postmodern is theory.
Now that's tainted to some degree with 

156
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:09,630
Marxist preconceptions,
but we won't get into that.

157
00:11:09,631 --> 00:11:14,631
But that's basically the idea and it's 
an idea with a certain amount of 

158
00:11:14,631 --> 00:11:18,830
justification.
There is a very large number of ways of 

159
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:21,710
interpreting the world and it isn't 
obvious which way or ways are right or 

160
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:25,980
why they're right.
So it's a complicated problem.

161
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:30,660
And so I was curious is like,
was this merely a difference of opinion?

162
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,200
The West had a certain set of axioms 
that it was acting out in the world and 

163
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:41,151
the Soviet bloc and the rest of the 
communist countries have another set of 

164
00:11:41,151 --> 00:11:44,691
axioms and they were both arbitrary and 
it was a matter of power or was there 

165
00:11:46,051 --> 00:11:49,110
something deeper at stake?
So that was question number two.

166
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:50,550
Question number three was,

167
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:57,400
was there an to brutal combat?
Was there an alternative way of solving 

168
00:12:01,201 --> 00:12:06,201
the dispute too brutal group combat,
something like that and because I always

169
00:12:06,211 --> 00:12:09,960
believed that if you understood the 
problem that you could solve it.

170
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:13,560
In fact that if,
if when you analyze the problem,

171
00:12:13,561 --> 00:12:15,750
a solution didn't emerge from the 
analysis,

172
00:12:15,751 --> 00:12:18,150
then you actually didn't understand the 
problem.

173
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:23,960
And so I thought if I delved into the 
problem deeply enough,

174
00:12:24,261 --> 00:12:27,240
then maybe I could figure out what might
constitute a solution.

175
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:30,140
Assuming there was such a thing because 
I couldn't.

176
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,040
I knew after writing a fair bit of it 
that we were.

177
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,480
That there was a real problem because

178
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:42,170
you can get belief systems that are 
locked in combat and then obviously the 

179
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:45,150
terrible consequence of that is the 
combat.

180
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:51,020
But then I also knew,
and this was probably more from reading 

181
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:51,870
Nicha than anything else,
that if your belief system collapses,

182
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:52,470
you might say,
well,

183
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:56,400
I don't want to fight with you about 
whose belief system is correct.

184
00:12:56,401 --> 00:13:01,401
I'll just let my mind go.
But the problem is if you let your 

185
00:13:01,401 --> 00:13:05,211
belief system go,
then you're swamped by nihilism and 

186
00:13:05,211 --> 00:13:06,690
hopelessness.
And that's not helpful.

187
00:13:06,691 --> 00:13:07,740
First of all,
it's very.

188
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:12,790
It's not helpful psychologically because
it produces emotional pain and anxiety 

189
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:16,230
and maybe at unbearable levels you can't
have a pointless life.

190
00:13:16,231 --> 00:13:17,090
It's,
it's,

191
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,660
it's,
it's a suffering,

192
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:23,930
a pointless life is pointless suffering 
and people can't sustain that without 

193
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:27,060
becoming demoralized.
That's only where they start.

194
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:28,200
Demoralized,
bitter,

195
00:13:28,201 --> 00:13:29,520
cruel,
resentful,

196
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,050
angry,
hostile,

197
00:13:31,051 --> 00:13:32,520
murderous,
genocidal.

198
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:35,280
Like all those things follow one from 
another.

199
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,530
If,
if things are sufficiently hopeless,

200
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:39,930
scared,
just let your belief system go.

201
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:44,490
But if you're locked into it and there's
another one that you're competing with,

202
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:48,180
then the consequences war.
It's like,

203
00:13:48,181 --> 00:13:53,181
so what is it nihilism on the one hand 
in war on the other that didn't seem 

204
00:13:53,181 --> 00:13:56,751
like especially given outcome of like 
say the Third World War that neither of 

205
00:13:57,571 --> 00:13:59,490
those seemed like acceptable 
alternatives,

206
00:13:59,491 --> 00:14:04,491
but I couldn't see any other.
I couldn't see that there was anything 

207
00:14:04,491 --> 00:14:08,541
else other than those two alternatives 
and so that's what I tried to layout in 

208
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:11,400
in this book.
Maps of meaning and most of the thoughts

209
00:14:11,401 --> 00:14:15,570
that I expressed in 12 rules for life,
not all of them and in the lectures that

210
00:14:15,571 --> 00:14:17,520
I've done that have become popular on 
Youtube,

211
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:22,910
were all developed during the 15 year 
period that I worked on that book and I 

212
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:25,440
worked on it.
I would say obsessively really.

213
00:14:25,441 --> 00:14:30,441
I wrote about three hours a day and I 
thought about it for pretty much 12 

214
00:14:30,901 --> 00:14:34,410
other hours and so I was thinking 
constantly.

215
00:14:34,411 --> 00:14:36,780
It was not an obvious why,
but.

216
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:41,900
Well,
I told you why for some reason all of 

217
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,150
that manifested itself to me as a 
cardinal problem,

218
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,890
but I concluded and tried to lay out the
rationale for this,

219
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:51,780
the,

220
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,950
the fight between these two belief 
systems,

221
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,810
but let's.
Let's look at the belief systems.

222
00:14:56,811 --> 00:15:01,811
It's not communism versus the West.
It's not communism versus the free 

223
00:15:01,811 --> 00:15:02,090
market.
It's different than that.

224
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,930
It's collectivism in it's far right 
form,

225
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:11,230
let's say the far right form of the 
Nazis and the far left form of the 

226
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:15,160
radical leftists,
the communists sets collectivism versus 

227
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:19,361
individualism.
That's the fundamental conflict and 

228
00:15:19,361 --> 00:15:20,420
there are variants of the collectivist 
viewpoint,

229
00:15:20,421 --> 00:15:25,421
but it doesn't matter.
They can be grouped under the rubric of 

230
00:15:25,421 --> 00:15:25,421
Collectivism.
There's important differences,

231
00:15:25,421 --> 00:15:28,940
but we don't have to get into that with 
the western take wasn't collectivist.

232
00:15:28,941 --> 00:15:33,941
It was individualist and the central 
idea of the West was that although 

233
00:15:33,981 --> 00:15:38,981
people are obviously obviously aggregate
into groups and many different groups 

234
00:15:40,161 --> 00:15:43,550
because all of you are members of very 
of many different groups,

235
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:45,410
ethnicities,
genders,

236
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,940
sexes,
races,

237
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:49,070
family groups,
community groups.

238
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:54,760
You can be grouped a very large number 
of ways and and you tend towards the 

239
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,560
adoption of something approximating a 
group identity because you know,

240
00:15:57,561 --> 00:16:02,561
you take care of your family and you're 
a member of your community and you have 

241
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:06,251
a certain amount of justifiable 
patriotism in relationship to your 

242
00:16:06,251 --> 00:16:06,251
state.

243
00:16:06,251 --> 00:16:08,510
The group identity is definitely part of
who you are.

244
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:14,710
The question is what is the fundamental 
defining characteristic of who you are 

245
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:20,260
and the collectivist definition is that 
you are the Avatar of a collective and 

246
00:16:21,771 --> 00:16:26,120
that's fundamentally who you are,
but the western perspective is not that.

247
00:16:26,121 --> 00:16:31,121
The Western perspective is that despite 
the fact that people have an individual 

248
00:16:31,121 --> 00:16:36,070
level and a collective level,
the individual level is to be regarded 

249
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:40,391
as paramount.
You're to be treated above all else 

250
00:16:40,391 --> 00:16:41,030
above all,
as an individual.

251
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,540
Now,
and I looked into that very deeply and I

252
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:48,470
thought that isn't arbitrary.
It's actually correct.

253
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,170
That's the right way of looking at the 
world,

254
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:52,640
and then you might say,
well,

255
00:16:52,641 --> 00:16:57,641
what do you mean the right way?
And of course that's the right question 

256
00:16:57,641 --> 00:17:00,791
because that is the question.
If something's the right way of looking 

257
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:04,601
at something,
well why is it the right way of looking 

258
00:17:04,601 --> 00:17:04,601
at it?

259
00:17:04,601 --> 00:17:08,650
But I want to put a little spin on that 
too because usually when we talk about 

260
00:17:08,811 --> 00:17:12,560
individualism in the West,
at least in the modern world,

261
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,070
maybe let's say for the last 50 years or
something like that.

262
00:17:16,071 --> 00:17:19,070
Maybe it's after World War Two,
I don't know exactly the parameters.

263
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:24,071
It doesn't matter.
Certainly since the 19 sixties when we 

264
00:17:24,071 --> 00:17:25,220
think about the tradition of 
individuality in the west,

265
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:30,460
we think about the tradition of 
individual rights and there's a problem 

266
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:35,201
with that because the fundamental 
individual tradition of the West is not 

267
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,710
individual rights and rights have a 
problem.

268
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:43,430
Rights are sort of like you're 
privileged compared to other people.

269
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:48,490
I have these rights and don't tread on 
them that that wall's me off and makes 

270
00:17:50,221 --> 00:17:52,620
me privileged.
In some sense.

271
00:17:52,621 --> 00:17:54,840
It means that I have the right to do 
things,

272
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:57,240
have the right to pursue my own 
interests.

273
00:17:57,241 --> 00:18:00,030
I have the right to pursue happiness,
for example,

274
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:02,880
that's explicitly laid out in the 
American system.

275
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:08,580
The rights or what is special about me,
and so when you look at individuality or

276
00:18:08,581 --> 00:18:13,140
individualism from that perspective,
you can think about it as a selfish idea

277
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:18,410
and it's often criticized by 
collectivists precisely for that 

278
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:21,951
selfishness,
but the fundamental idea of the 

279
00:18:21,951 --> 00:18:22,770
individual in the West isn't predicated 
on rights.

280
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:26,880
Even though that's important,
it's predicated on responsibility.

281
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:33,020
Right?
So your role as an individual in the 

282
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:36,660
West isn't to be the bearer of rights of
intrinsic rights,

283
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:41,870
even though those are important.
Your responsibility as an individual in 

284
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:46,431
the west is to bear the responsibility 
of an individual and it's in bearing 

285
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:52,791
that responsibility that you set 
yourself right and your family right and

286
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:57,300
you keep the state on track.
It's not from expressing your rights,

287
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:02,990
it's from shouldering your 
responsibility and I would say that the 

288
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:07,461
reason that you have rights in the West 
is so that you can shoulder your 

289
00:19:07,461 --> 00:19:08,070
responsibility.

290
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:13,250
It's not the other way around.
It's so that you can do what's best on 

291
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:17,511
your behalf and in that manner,
do what's best on your family's behalf 

292
00:19:17,511 --> 00:19:21,681
and in that manner contribute to the 
degree that you can to the community and

293
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:24,390
that if you do all those things 
simultaneously,

294
00:19:24,391 --> 00:19:27,330
which means to accept the responsibility
for that,

295
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,310
then things move ahead as well as they 
can move ahead.

296
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:37,610
Which doesn't necessarily mean well 
because life is very difficult and 

297
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:42,440
there's no sure way through it.
There's only less bad approaches.

298
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,400
That might be a way of thinking about it
and the least bad approach you can 

299
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:53,991
manage is to shoulder your 
responsibility as an individual and 

300
00:19:54,301 --> 00:19:59,301
that's the and I would say that one of 
the things that drives the collectivist 

301
00:20:00,031 --> 00:20:05,031
ethos,
which is often formulated in terms of 

302
00:20:05,031 --> 00:20:08,960
compassion for the oppressed,
which is something we'll talk about a 

303
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,351
little bit later,
is actually a deep desire to at all 

304
00:20:12,351 --> 00:20:16,671
costs,
avoid that responsibility and it's no 

305
00:20:16,671 --> 00:20:19,980
wonder because the responsibility is 
overwhelming.

306
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:23,760
Say The world fundamentally is a tragic 
place,

307
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,480
right?
It's a place in which each of us is 

308
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,581
broken and it's contaminated by the ever
present reality of betrayal and 

309
00:20:32,581 --> 00:20:37,581
malevolence and to shoulder the 
responsibility first for even admitting 

310
00:20:38,401 --> 00:20:43,401
to that and second,
for assuming that you are duty bound,

311
00:20:45,061 --> 00:20:48,100
let's say to do something about that.
Well,

312
00:20:48,101 --> 00:20:53,101
that's a task that anyone who has his or
her eyes open should be leery of 

313
00:20:53,381 --> 00:20:55,270
accepting.
And I would say,

314
00:20:56,020 --> 00:21:01,020
well,
perhaps there's no credible reason for 

315
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,260
accepting it except that every other 
alternative is worse.

316
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:08,910
And so that's a brutal fact.
So the antidote to collectivism is 

317
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:15,660
individualism,
but it's not the individualism of the 

318
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:20,251
privileged person with rights.
It's the terrible burden of the 

319
00:21:20,251 --> 00:21:25,111
individual who determines that he or she
will shoulder their responsibility to 

320
00:21:25,511 --> 00:21:26,350
that most.

321
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:34,020
So I developed that idea in maps of 
meaning that and I made a lot of 

322
00:21:35,501 --> 00:21:39,250
lectures about that book,
many of which are on Youtube,

323
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:44,880
some of which have become widely viewed,
I would say by one hundreds of thousands

324
00:21:45,371 --> 00:21:47,470
of people now.
And so that's.

325
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:52,650
And that course always had a dramatic 
effect on my students and their most 

326
00:21:53,081 --> 00:21:58,081
typical comment.
There's two classes of typical comments 

327
00:21:58,081 --> 00:22:02,730
that I got from students about my maps 
of meaning courses and it's the same 

328
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:06,091
comments that I get from people now when
they come and talk to me about my 

329
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:06,310
lectures.
The first comment is,

330
00:22:06,311 --> 00:22:08,830
and this is about maybe a quarter of the
people,

331
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:14,160
is that watching the lectures are taking
the course,

332
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:17,560
enabled them to put words to things they
knew,

333
00:22:17,561 --> 00:22:21,070
they knew but didn't know how to say.
And so.

334
00:22:21,071 --> 00:22:24,850
And that's fine because that was an ex 
that was actually an explicit purpose of

335
00:22:24,851 --> 00:22:25,330
the writing.

336
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:30,330
And the course,
and the second is that it helped people 

337
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:32,560
straightened out their lives and that's 
also not that surprising to me because a

338
00:22:32,561 --> 00:22:37,561
lot of what I integrated into that book 
and the lectures and the lectures were 

339
00:22:38,381 --> 00:22:43,381
also associated with my personality 
course were ideas from the great 

340
00:22:43,381 --> 00:22:46,750
clinical psychologists and psychiatrists
of the 20th century.

341
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:49,330
There was a dozen of them or so,
or maybe 20,

342
00:22:49,331 --> 00:22:54,331
who were all outstanding geniuses,
have slightly different types who 

343
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
learned all sorts of things about how 
people could put themselves self 

344
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,470
together properly as individuals,
and if you learn about those things,

345
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:07,620
they're actually really helpful.
That's not surprising because they sit 

346
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:10,840
at the core of an entire domain of 
science and art,

347
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:13,360
let's say,
devoted to improving people's individual

348
00:23:13,361 --> 00:23:18,361
lives.
I wove the responsibility idea into 12 

349
00:23:21,101 --> 00:23:24,430
rules because that's really what it is.
In some sense,

350
00:23:24,431 --> 00:23:29,431
it's a a call to the voluntary adoption 
of maximal individual responsibility and

351
00:23:32,381 --> 00:23:34,840
it's a psychological work,
not a political work.

352
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:39,870
Now,
I think the reason that it's attracted 

353
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:42,811
so much political attention,
let's say some of which couldn't log 

354
00:23:42,811 --> 00:23:46,100
referred to in the introduction is,
well,

355
00:23:46,101 --> 00:23:51,101
there's two reasons.
One is because I took what might be 

356
00:23:51,101 --> 00:23:53,771
regarded as a political stance about 
some compelled speech legislation in 

357
00:23:53,771 --> 00:23:57,821
Canada.
I never regarded that as a political 

358
00:23:57,821 --> 00:24:00,311
move because I regarded the legislation 
itself as something that wasn't a 

359
00:24:00,311 --> 00:24:04,721
political move.
I regarded it as an attempt by the 

360
00:24:04,721 --> 00:24:08,261
politicians to jump outside their domain
of acceptable conduct into the 

361
00:24:08,421 --> 00:24:13,421
philosophical or even the theological 
realm because you don't mess with the 

362
00:24:13,421 --> 00:24:18,311
idea of free speech in a Western country
and there's very sophisticated reasons 

363
00:24:19,071 --> 00:24:22,700
for that and it doesn't matter what your
reasons for doing it are.

364
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:28,570
You don't go there and so,
but it happened to be the more radical 

365
00:24:28,671 --> 00:24:33,410
leftists that were pushing this forward 
and because I objected to it than it was

366
00:24:33,411 --> 00:24:38,411
in their interest to assume that I must 
be the worst sort of right wing die hard

367
00:24:39,471 --> 00:24:44,471
I suppose because otherwise they'd have 
to contend with my actual arguments.

368
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,440
And so it's simpler just to shoot the 
messenger than to contend with the 

369
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:50,960
arguments.
And you know,

370
00:24:50,961 --> 00:24:55,961
if you stand up and say there's 
something wrong in a place like Canada 

371
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:58,070
where most things aren't wrong,
then it's reasonable.

372
00:24:58,071 --> 00:25:01,640
Also for people to assume there must be 
something wrong with you because most of

373
00:25:01,641 --> 00:25:06,641
the time there isn't anything wrong with
the country and so a certain amount of 

374
00:25:06,641 --> 00:25:08,000
testing is a reasonable thing for people
to do.

375
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:16,330
I guess the other element of this that's
political in some sense though is that 

376
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:20,320
within the collectivist viewpoint,
this is something that's very 

377
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,501
interesting with regard to free speech.
I didn't really figure this out until a 

378
00:25:23,501 --> 00:25:26,711
couple of weeks ago and although the 
radical leftists and you see this 

379
00:25:26,711 --> 00:25:30,671
particularly in the United States now,
although the Americans have a very 

380
00:25:30,671 --> 00:25:34,301
strong tradition of free speech,
the radical leftists are opposed to 

381
00:25:34,301 --> 00:25:36,620
freedom of speech,
but that's not really right.

382
00:25:36,621 --> 00:25:40,880
It's not the way to think about.
In the radical leftist collectivist view

383
00:25:40,881 --> 00:25:45,881
of the world.
There's actually no such thing as free 

384
00:25:45,881 --> 00:25:48,641
speech.
It's in worst criticism then than 

385
00:25:48,641 --> 00:25:52,390
opposing it because the collectivists 
believed that you're nothing but an 

386
00:25:52,431 --> 00:25:54,500
Avatar of your group.
First of all,

387
00:25:54,501 --> 00:25:59,501
there is no you.
You're defined by your group membership 

388
00:25:59,501 --> 00:26:03,220
and then the world is a landscape of 
groups each vying for predominance and 

389
00:26:05,091 --> 00:26:10,091
that's what there is and it's and so 
when you say that you're speaking your 

390
00:26:10,091 --> 00:26:14,831
mind,
that isn't something that you can do 

391
00:26:14,831 --> 00:26:14,831
from the collectivist view point.

392
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:19,900
What you're doing is acting as an 
unconscious Avatar of the power demands 

393
00:26:20,181 --> 00:26:22,430
of your group.
There is no you.

394
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,280
There was no free speech.
There's no your opinion.

395
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:30,400
There's no facts for that matter.
Everything is to be viewed in 

396
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,631
relationship to the power struggle 
between groups that even in principle 

397
00:26:34,631 --> 00:26:39,311
cannot communicate and so the other 
reason that I detest let's say the 

398
00:26:40,371 --> 00:26:45,371
collectivist viewpoint is because I see 
that it leads nowhere but to conflict 

399
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:51,950
because if people cannot speak as 
individuals between groups,

400
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:57,840
then all they can do is submit or fight.
Those are the options,

401
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,540
right?
Negotiation,

402
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:06,110
capitulation or warfare.
Those are the options and the only

403
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:13,530
process that allows for negotiation in 
the absence of capitulation or conflict.

404
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,490
His speech,
because we can talk over our differences

405
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:23,790
and that discussion is going to be 
contentious because we actually have 

406
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:28,051
differences,
but compared to the contentiousness of 

407
00:27:28,051 --> 00:27:30,250
not talking over the differences,
it's a walk in the park.

408
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:35,550
You know?
I saw something quite remarkable when I 

409
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:37,891
was in London a month and a half ago.
I was on this political show and one of 

410
00:27:38,441 --> 00:27:43,441
the things they did in this section that
didn't have anything to do with me was 

411
00:27:43,441 --> 00:27:46,560
to show a bunch of clips from the the,
the.

412
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:51,780
There's a question period that the 
British have evolved where the 

413
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:55,861
opposition can go after the prime 
minister and the woman that was 

414
00:27:55,861 --> 00:27:59,611
appearing with me on the show had 
written a book about that called Punch 

415
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:01,120
and Judy,
if I remember correctly,

416
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:06,300
and they showed a bunch of clips of 
English MPs attacking the prime minister

417
00:28:06,671 --> 00:28:10,090
and the prime minister's response all 
the way from Thatcher forward.

418
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:15,230
It was absolutely vicious in the way 
that well-educated British people can be

419
00:28:15,401 --> 00:28:20,401
vicious,
which is very oppressive form of 

420
00:28:20,401 --> 00:28:22,651
viciousness and was no holds barred.
Verbal combat,

421
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,190
and you might think,
well,

422
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:27,370
isn't that horrible?
Because it's certainly rife,

423
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:32,400
let's say with microaggressions,
but it's not horrible because none of 

424
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,690
them had their hands around each other's
necks,

425
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:37,150
right?
It was all civilized.

426
00:28:37,151 --> 00:28:42,151
It was everyone was standing where they 
were supposed to stand and they were 

427
00:28:42,151 --> 00:28:45,181
hurling invective and making criticisms 
and making accusations and defending 

428
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:49,831
themselves and all of that,
but it was all contained within the 

429
00:28:49,831 --> 00:28:53,290
peaceful confines of this,
of the house of parliament,

430
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:55,990
and that's a miracle.
Really.

431
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,380
It's a miracle and the British are 
particularly good at that,

432
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:04,800
and so you leave free speech alone 
because the alternative to free speech 

433
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:09,561
is capitulation or conflict,
and unless you want one of those or both

434
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:15,240
and you might,
then you don't interfere with the 

435
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,271
mechanism that enables people's people 
to state the nature of their reality and

436
00:29:18,431 --> 00:29:23,431
to clarify that and to negotiate with 
others even though that negotiation is 

437
00:29:23,431 --> 00:29:27,631
painful and emotionally demanding and 
threatening and anxiety provoking and 

438
00:29:27,631 --> 00:29:31,000
aggression instigating and all of those 
things,

439
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,950
because the alternative is far worse.

440
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:44,870
I wove the idea of individual 
responsibility through through 12 rules.

441
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:51,480
While we might say we might begin by 
thinking about how that's related to the

442
00:29:51,491 --> 00:29:56,491
idea of free speech.
It's like you have to find your way in 

443
00:29:57,761 --> 00:30:01,420
the world,
let's say with all of your peculiarities

444
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:06,670
or idiosyncrasies and your differences 
and the way you do that is by acting in 

445
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:11,641
the world,
but the way you prepare to act is by 

446
00:30:11,641 --> 00:30:13,540
thinking and really what you're doing 
when you're thinking.

447
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:18,750
So philosopher named Alfred North 
Whitehead who said something very 

448
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:21,871
intelligent about thinking.
He said that the reason we think is so 

449
00:30:21,871 --> 00:30:23,740
that our thoughts can die instead of us.
Right?

450
00:30:23,741 --> 00:30:28,741
And it's a Darwinian idea.
So the way animals adapt to the world 

451
00:30:28,741 --> 00:30:31,630
across time is that animals produced 
variants,

452
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:34,270
variant offspring,
many of them,

453
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,150
and most of them were unsuccessful and 
die,

454
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:42,780
but a few of them are successful enough 
in that time and place to reproduce.

455
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:48,030
And so the animal keeps living across 
the millennia varying slightly as it 

456
00:30:49,091 --> 00:30:54,091
does.
So to adapt to the transformations of 

457
00:30:54,091 --> 00:30:54,610
the environment.
Human beings do the same thing,

458
00:30:54,611 --> 00:30:57,100
but we also have figured out how to 
abstract that.

459
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:02,400
And so what we do when we think is that 
we produce a fictional world that's an 

460
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:08,010
simulation of the real world and we 
populate that simulated world with 

461
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:12,721
simulations of us and then we let those 
simulations play out in the simulated 

462
00:31:12,721 --> 00:31:17,671
world and the ones that are successful,
we embody and act out and the ones that 

463
00:31:17,671 --> 00:31:22,141
are unsuccessful,
we abandoned and let die and we do that 

464
00:31:22,141 --> 00:31:26,131
when we're thinking in dreams and we'd 
do that when we think in stories and we 

465
00:31:26,771 --> 00:31:31,771
even do that when we think in words.
Although it's not as obvious when you 

466
00:31:31,771 --> 00:31:35,761
argue internally,
which is what you do when you think you 

467
00:31:35,761 --> 00:31:38,850
have an Avatar that manifests itself as 
one point of view and an Avatar that 

468
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:42,811
manifests itself as another and you let 
them engage in conflict and the one that

469
00:31:43,241 --> 00:31:44,810
loses you let go of.

470
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:49,830
That's a sacrifice.
And if you're discussing something with 

471
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:52,951
someone and it's important that you both
put your viewpoints forward and you 

472
00:31:52,951 --> 00:31:56,530
analyze the consequences of the dispute 
and then you walk away with any luck,

473
00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:01,580
why is there then you were so that you 
can embody a motive being that's more 

474
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:05,971
likely to be successful and you do that 
in part in large part by exercising your

475
00:32:06,251 --> 00:32:08,890
freedom of speech and you might think,
well,

476
00:32:08,891 --> 00:32:13,891
why?
Freedom of speech and freedom of 

477
00:32:13,891 --> 00:32:15,961
thought.
And the answer to that is don't be 

478
00:32:15,961 --> 00:32:18,421
thinking that you think because thinking
is very hard and most people can't think

479
00:32:19,811 --> 00:32:24,811
at all,
and even if you can think you're not 

480
00:32:24,811 --> 00:32:27,481
very good at it,
I mean think about what you have to do 

481
00:32:27,481 --> 00:32:27,481
technically to think.
First of all,

482
00:32:27,481 --> 00:32:30,970
you have to formulate the problem that's
hard enough and you have to formulate it

483
00:32:30,971 --> 00:32:31,510
precisely.

484
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:36,900
Then you have to generate multiple 
potential solutions to the problem and 

485
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:41,581
then you have to let those solutions 
argue into a hierarchy internally.

486
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:46,130
And so you have to be able to tolerate 
that stress,

487
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:51,131
right?
You can't just be one thing if you're 

488
00:32:51,131 --> 00:32:51,131
going to think because thinking isn't 
just saying that.

489
00:32:51,131 --> 00:32:52,790
What I think is right,
that's not thinking at all.

490
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:57,940
Thinking is questioning whether or not 
what you think is right is right and 

491
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:01,391
that's really hard.
It's very demanding and so and you can 

492
00:33:01,391 --> 00:33:05,171
do that to some degree,
but you're not as good at it as you 

493
00:33:05,171 --> 00:33:05,171
think.
Even if you're a pretty good thinker.

494
00:33:05,171 --> 00:33:09,400
Mostly the way you think is by talking 
and you talk and mostly when you talk 

495
00:33:10,281 --> 00:33:15,281
and think it's contentious as you know 
if you've ever had an intimate 

496
00:33:15,281 --> 00:33:18,950
relationship with someone because an 
intimate relationship,

497
00:33:18,951 --> 00:33:20,750
if it,
if it has any worth at all,

498
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:26,140
is a place where there's tremendous 
contention but it's bounded within 

499
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:30,671
something approximating mutual respect 
and the willingness to continue to play 

500
00:33:30,671 --> 00:33:34,901
the game across time and the reason that
an intimate relationship as contentious 

501
00:33:34,901 --> 00:33:34,901
as.

502
00:33:34,901 --> 00:33:39,050
Because life is very,
very difficult and people are different 

503
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,460
and we face extraordinarily complex 
problems together.

504
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:45,610
Like how to make a living and how to.
How to operate properly in our careers 

505
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:47,420
and how to rank order the importance of 
our careers.

506
00:33:47,421 --> 00:33:52,421
And how to manage our domestic economies
and how to discipline our kids and 

507
00:33:52,421 --> 00:33:56,170
whether or not to have kids and how to 
enter middle age and how to grow old 

508
00:33:56,170 --> 00:34:01,001
gracefully and how to live productively 
and where to vacation and all of these 

509
00:34:01,001 --> 00:34:03,950
things which are extraordinarily 
difficult problems and the only way that

510
00:34:03,951 --> 00:34:08,951
we can solve them is by butting heads to
some degree and communicating freely 

511
00:34:08,951 --> 00:34:13,571
about what the possibilities are and 
negotiating a solution and that's 

512
00:34:13,571 --> 00:34:15,380
thinking and in order to do that 
thinking,

513
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:20,620
you have to be able to speak freely and 
you certainly have to be willing to 

514
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:21,350
offend someone.
I mean,

515
00:34:21,351 --> 00:34:25,040
of all the stupid questions I've ever 
been asked by journalists,

516
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:30,280
the question,
what makes you think you have the right 

517
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:33,251
to offend someone by what you say is by 
far the most miraculously ignorant.

518
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,140
And I say that because,

519
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:36,810
well,

520
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:41,660
no,
it just,

521
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:45,470
it just sets me back on my heels to some
degree because I think,

522
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:48,520
well,
what's your claim here?

523
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:53,560
Your claim is.
Your first claim is we could 

524
00:34:54,561 --> 00:34:59,561
hypothetically discussed something 
important without one of us getting 

525
00:34:59,561 --> 00:34:59,561
upset.
It's like,

526
00:34:59,561 --> 00:35:03,350
that's not gonna happen.
If you ever discussed anything important

527
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:08,351
with anyone,
including just discussing it with 

528
00:35:08,351 --> 00:35:10,100
yourself,
not only are you going to get upset,

529
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,550
you're going to get so upset that you 
probably won't even do it.

530
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:14,750
You know,
you think,

531
00:35:14,751 --> 00:35:16,130
well,
I have a difficult problem.

532
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:18,380
What do you.
What's your first reaction?

533
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:23,590
Well,
I'm going to sit right here and think 

534
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:23,590
about that.
It's like,

535
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:23,590
no,
that isn't your reaction.

536
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:27,641
Your reaction is to go like play a video
game or watch a youtube video or or 

537
00:35:27,641 --> 00:35:30,650
vacuum your bedroom or do the dishes or 
whatever you can do.

538
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,970
Not to think about that.

539
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:34,400
That's what you're going to do.
So you know,

540
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:40,360
and then if you're going to have a 
discussion with your wife or your 

541
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,040
husband or your kids and it's about 
something important.

542
00:35:41,041 --> 00:35:46,041
It's like if you're a normal person,
your heart rate goes up and it's like 

543
00:35:46,041 --> 00:35:50,781
it's demanding and then you have to 
think it through and then you're 

544
00:35:50,781 --> 00:35:53,211
probably wrong and you're going to 
stumble over your words and God only 

545
00:35:53,211 --> 00:35:56,421
knows if you're going to reach a 
solution and you can't tell if it's 

546
00:35:56,421 --> 00:35:58,881
going to mean the end of your damn 
relationship and like the catastrophe 

547
00:35:58,881 --> 00:36:03,201
lurks everywhere when you're discussing 
difficult issues and the rule is 

548
00:36:03,201 --> 00:36:04,200
something like,
but you can't offend anyone.

549
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,520
It's like,
well then okay,

550
00:36:05,521 --> 00:36:10,521
fine.
Then you never get to talk about 

551
00:36:10,521 --> 00:36:10,521
anything that's important with anyone 
ever including yourself.

552
00:36:10,521 --> 00:36:12,330
So like that's supposed to be the rule.
Then you think,

553
00:36:12,331 --> 00:36:15,390
well even if it's not quite that bad,
it's like let's say,

554
00:36:15,391 --> 00:36:19,020
so here I'm addressing about 850 people,
something like that.

555
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:22,140
It's like,
what's the probability that I could talk

556
00:36:22,141 --> 00:36:27,141
about anything that any of you would 
ever want to listen to for more than 

557
00:36:27,141 --> 00:36:27,630
about 15 seconds,
you know,

558
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:32,660
that would grip your interests without 
me or offending at least one person in 

559
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:35,430
this room with each sentence.
And there's a thousand people in here.

560
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:38,790
You know,
and some people are unbelievably easy to

561
00:36:38,791 --> 00:36:39,990
offend,
there's that.

562
00:36:39,991 --> 00:36:42,240
They're just looking for a reason to be 
offended,

563
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,190
so,
so there's that problem.

564
00:36:44,191 --> 00:36:46,620
But if we're going to deal with things 
that are,

565
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:51,680
that are solid and contentious and why,
talk about things that we already all 

566
00:36:52,381 --> 00:36:54,480
agree on.
We've already solved those problems.

567
00:36:54,481 --> 00:36:57,330
We can only really talk about things we 
don't agree on.

568
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:02,480
It's the only thing worth talking about.
Well of course everyone's going to be 

569
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,410
offended.
And so for a journalist to ask that,

570
00:37:04,411 --> 00:37:06,630
it's like,
what the Hell's with you?

571
00:37:06,631 --> 00:37:09,000
What?
What planet do you inhabit?

572
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:14,450
Don't you understand that your entire 
discipline is predicated on not only 

573
00:37:16,441 --> 00:37:21,441
your right to offend someone,
but the responsibility that you have to 

574
00:37:21,441 --> 00:37:24,240
offend people.
It's like that's it's

575
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:44,750
thinking is an offensive act,
which is why tyrants hated,

576
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:50,710
right?
Because one of the rules and tyranny is 

577
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:53,770
don't think why?
Because I already know all the answers 

578
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:57,560
and you're supposed to accept my answers
as the tyrant,

579
00:37:57,890 --> 00:37:59,840
and so there's no need for your 
thinking.

580
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:01,490
And you might be saying,
well,

581
00:38:01,491 --> 00:38:05,420
my life isn't going as well as it could.
And the tyrant says,

582
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:10,570
well,
you don't get to think that because in 

583
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:11,060
my utopian tyranny,
everything's perfect,

584
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:16,510
and if you're suffering,
that means you're politically suspect 

585
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:21,190
because you're suffering,
your inability to recognize that the 

586
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:23,720
utopia has already manifested itself.
Your unhappiness is actually a political

587
00:38:23,721 --> 00:38:26,000
crime,
but if you just keep it to yourself,

588
00:38:26,001 --> 00:38:29,780
well we'll let you keep your head.
But if you have the the.

589
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:35,350
If you're driven to the extreme where 
you have to express the fact you're 

590
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:41,340
unhappy,
perhaps that your child doesn't have 

591
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:43,321
enough to eat,
then it's off to the Gulag with you and 

592
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,910
all your family as well because there'll
be no thinking here.

593
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:48,550
And even if there is,
they'll certainly be no talking.

594
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:52,510
So here's something that happened 
recently in Venezuela.

595
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:58,110
This is worth thinking about for all the
people who harbor collectivist Utopian 

596
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:01,300
Dreams,
Venezuela,

597
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:04,210
the Venezuelan government.
About two months ago,

598
00:39:04,211 --> 00:39:08,260
this was reported in the New York Times,
which is not a newspaper,

599
00:39:08,261 --> 00:39:11,290
I would say that would be intrinsically 
biased against Venezuela,

600
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:17,070
said that it was now illegal to diagnose
the cause of a child's death in a 

601
00:39:17,681 --> 00:39:22,681
Venezuelan hospital as starvation.
Because the Venezuelans,

602
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:28,320
Venezuelan government's answer to the 
problem of children starving was to make

603
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:33,990
it illegal to notice it in hospitals.
And that's a tyranny,

604
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:39,570
right?
That's a place where thought is not 

605
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:41,671
allowed.
That's a place where free speech is not 

606
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:43,030
allowed.
So it seems to me that that's not a good

607
00:39:43,031 --> 00:39:48,031
place to go to say the least.
And we've gone there many times in the 

608
00:39:48,031 --> 00:39:52,120
last hundred and 50 years and we should 
perhaps think very hard about whether or

609
00:39:52,121 --> 00:39:53,740
not we ever want to go there again.

610
00:39:55,430 --> 00:40:00,430
Well,
the first rule in 12 rules for life is 

611
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:02,170
stand up straight with your shoulders 
back and I want to tell you a little bit

612
00:40:02,171 --> 00:40:06,340
about the world in which that rule 
applies and it's our world,

613
00:40:06,341 --> 00:40:11,341
but it isn't necessarily the world that 
you think of when you think of our 

614
00:40:11,341 --> 00:40:12,670
world.
Although it's the world,

615
00:40:12,671 --> 00:40:17,671
you know,
it's funny because it's a world you 

616
00:40:17,671 --> 00:40:17,671
know,
but you don't know.

617
00:40:17,671 --> 00:40:18,580
You know it.
It's a world that presents itself to you

618
00:40:18,581 --> 00:40:22,840
in literary form and in mythological 
foreman and symbolic form.

619
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:26,080
And you all understand it,
but you can't articulate it.

620
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:30,610
But I can articulate some of it.
How many of you have seen the lion king?

621
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,780
Okay,
how many of you haven't?

622
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,940
Okay,
so that's a better question.

623
00:40:35,941 --> 00:40:40,941
Hardly you guys should see the lion king
because obviously there's something 

624
00:40:40,941 --> 00:40:40,941
wrong with you.
So,

625
00:40:40,941 --> 00:40:42,150
so,
and in any ways.

626
00:40:42,151 --> 00:40:44,280
I want to tell you about the world of 
the lion king.

627
00:40:44,281 --> 00:40:49,281
Now,
one of the things I want you to notice 

628
00:40:49,281 --> 00:40:49,380
is that when you go see that movie or 
when you show it to your kids,

629
00:40:49,381 --> 00:40:52,590
when you watch it at home,
I don't care what you fall into it,

630
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,960
and that's very strange because first of
all,

631
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,760
it's not a world.
It's drawings,

632
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:58,950
right?
It's animated drawings of a world.

633
00:40:58,951 --> 00:41:01,680
It's very low resolution and the 
creatures aren't human.

634
00:41:01,681 --> 00:41:05,010
They're animals.
You've all noticed that no doubt and the

635
00:41:05,011 --> 00:41:10,011
world is magical because things happen 
in it that aren't the sorts of things 

636
00:41:10,011 --> 00:41:11,280
that obviously happened in the real 
world,

637
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:12,960
but you don't care about any of that.

638
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:16,800
You don't care that the animals talk.
You don't care that the lions are kings.

639
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:22,310
All of that makes perfect sense to you.
And that means that which is a very 

640
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:26,241
strange thing,
which it means that the manner in which 

641
00:41:26,241 --> 00:41:30,471
the characters are represented and the 
world that they inhabit is somehow 

642
00:41:30,471 --> 00:41:33,831
familiar to you because otherwise you 
wouldn't fall into it and you wouldn't 

643
00:41:33,831 --> 00:41:35,120
even.
And you'd noticed that what you're doing

644
00:41:35,121 --> 00:41:37,340
is so strange because it really is so 
strange.

645
00:41:37,341 --> 00:41:42,341
So imagine the opening of the lion king.
So what happens is that the camera pans 

646
00:41:42,621 --> 00:41:46,010
over the Great African plain and you see
all the animals gathering,

647
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:51,070
right?
They're all coming together and there's 

648
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:52,040
this kind of thrilling Black Gospel 
music going on in the background with an

649
00:41:52,041 --> 00:41:55,220
African beat and so,
and it's really well done.

650
00:41:55,230 --> 00:42:00,230
The opening of that movie and then the 
camera pans up like,

651
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:05,860
like it's revealing something and you 
see this structure that's known in the 

652
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:06,590
movie as pride rock.

653
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:12,100
And so it's this structure that rises up
above the plane and it's shaped like 

654
00:42:12,291 --> 00:42:13,880
it's a mountain essentially.
Although it's not,

655
00:42:13,881 --> 00:42:16,190
it's just a rock,
but it's a high place.

656
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,910
It's a place that you can,
that you can view everything from.

657
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:25,060
Right?
So it's a place that it's a place from 

658
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:25,060
which you can get an overview,
it's a place from which you can see,

659
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:30,640
and you're introduced to the king's 
little bird whose name I don't remember 

660
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,360
at the moment,
and he's the eyes of the king.

661
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:37,450
So the king is obviously something that 
has eyes because he has a bird and the 

662
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:40,250
bird can fly around from up above and 
see everything and report to him.

663
00:42:40,251 --> 00:42:42,980
So whatever the king is is associated 
with the bird.

664
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:48,280
Just like horace,
the ancient Egyptian God was associated 

665
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:48,590
with a Falcon.
In fact,

666
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:53,800
for exactly that reason,
falcons can see better than any other 

667
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:54,290
creature by the way,
better even than human beings.

668
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:59,290
And we have very good eyesight.
So the king is the creature who can see 

669
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:03,040
and the king is Elian.
And the reason the lions that king is 

670
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:03,200
because the lions at the top of the food
chain,

671
00:43:03,201 --> 00:43:05,600
that's part of it.
But the line is a solar beast.

672
00:43:05,601 --> 00:43:10,601
He has a main.
He's associated with the sun he's 

673
00:43:10,601 --> 00:43:13,331
associated with the daytime is 
associated with power and majesty and 

674
00:43:13,331 --> 00:43:15,020
strength.
And it's not a mouse that's king right?

675
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:16,990
It's not a rat,
it's,

676
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,800
it's a,
it's a lion and you think,

677
00:43:18,801 --> 00:43:21,400
well obviously the lion is king.
You know,

678
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:26,410
everyone knows that even though animals 
don't have kings in case you didn't 

679
00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:29,981
notice,
so it's not self evident that it should 

680
00:43:29,981 --> 00:43:32,410
be the lion,
and then the lion is on the rock in the 

681
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:32,620
sun,
right?

682
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:37,660
So the rock sticks up above everything 
else and the lion is there and the lion 

683
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:41,530
is a paternal line and he has a mate and
the scene opens with them giving birth 

684
00:43:43,221 --> 00:43:48,221
and so it's a nativity scene and so,
and that's painfully obvious if you 

685
00:43:48,221 --> 00:43:50,240
watch it with a little bit of 
detachment,

686
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:55,630
it's entity scene and Rififi who's the 
Shaman priest lifts up the new Messiah 

687
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:04,810
to the sun and when that happens,
the music swells and all of the animals 

688
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:05,060
go don't own their knees.

689
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:07,610
And it's a very.
And then the,

690
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:13,050
there's a drum beat and the,
the words the lion king come up on stage

691
00:44:13,131 --> 00:44:16,040
and it's beautifully done.
It's beautifully done.

692
00:44:16,041 --> 00:44:21,041
They they pan up to the revelation of 
the lion cub to the sun two or three 

693
00:44:21,351 --> 00:44:22,610
times,
and it's really,

694
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:27,560
it's really emotional moment and it's 
because all of these levels of symbolism

695
00:44:27,561 --> 00:44:31,530
lock in at the same time you have the 
the environment,

696
00:44:31,531 --> 00:44:33,510
the field where all the animals 
gathered,

697
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:38,570
so all the animals are gathering to 
review the revelation of something 

698
00:44:38,570 --> 00:44:42,081
transcendent and the revelation of 
what's transcendent is the birth of the 

699
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:47,070
new hero to the king and Queen on the 
rock above the plane,

700
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:53,070
and there's a universal truth in that,
which is why the animators worked as 

701
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:55,590
hard as they did to make that scene and 
why it opens.

702
00:44:55,770 --> 00:44:59,040
What was one of the most spectacularly 
successful movies of all time.

703
00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:04,850
And the way the filmmakers do it is when
Rafiki holds up the the infant Simba,

704
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,930
the clouds break and the sun shines on 
it,

705
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:14,970
and that's the culminating moment and 
that's the revelation of the identity of

706
00:45:14,971 --> 00:45:18,240
the newborn hero with the consciousness 
of the sun.

707
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:22,440
And so we're light creatures.
We're daytime creatures.

708
00:45:22,441 --> 00:45:23,910
We're visual creatures,
right?

709
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:24,810
We're,
we're not.

710
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:26,280
We don't.
We're not nocturnal.

711
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:31,700
The night is when we're unconscious,
the day is when we're conscious and the 

712
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:36,800
terminology that we use that's 
associated with the furtherance of our 

713
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,970
consciousness is illumination and 
enlightenment,

714
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:44,330
and so there's a tight relationship 
between waking up and letting the light 

715
00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:48,921
shine in and developing and 
consciousness and the association 

716
00:45:49,561 --> 00:45:54,561
between the rays of the sun and the 
lifting up of the infant is the 

717
00:45:55,891 --> 00:45:59,040
association,
the ancient association between the hero

718
00:45:59,041 --> 00:46:02,490
who defeats the forces of darkness and 
the Sun itself,

719
00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:07,970
and you all know all of that,
which is why that opening works and why 

720
00:46:07,970 --> 00:46:09,870
it sets the scene for the rest of the 
movie.

721
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:12,900
And what's the rest of the movie?
Well,

722
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:15,420
we can think about the landscape.
First of all,

723
00:46:15,421 --> 00:46:18,180
there's a scene where Simba,
his father,

724
00:46:18,181 --> 00:46:21,780
takes him up on top of pride rock and 
tells him that his kingdom,

725
00:46:21,781 --> 00:46:26,130
that he's the king and his kingdom 
extends as far as the light touches.

726
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:30,060
So the landscape is a place with a 
pyramid in it.

727
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:35,390
There at the top of the pyramid on a 
plane that's circumscribed by the light 

728
00:46:35,390 --> 00:46:39,860
and outside the light is darkness.
And so the the mythological landscape in

729
00:46:40,291 --> 00:46:45,291
which this story reveals itself is light
versus darkness or order versus chaos,

730
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:50,130
and the reason for that is because that 
is our landscape.

731
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:55,610
We inhabit pyramid structures.
Those are hierarchies of other 

732
00:46:55,610 --> 00:46:57,330
hierarchies.
I think in our society,

733
00:46:57,331 --> 00:46:59,160
those are mostly hierarchies of 
competence.

734
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:00,480
We,
we,

735
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:05,460
we inhabit hierarchical structures on a 
plane that's defined,

736
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:10,320
defined by our understanding,
surrounded by what we do not comprehend,

737
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:13,560
and that's the universal human world.

738
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:19,580
And that hierarchy itself is a 
cooperative structure that enables us to

739
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:25,550
live with a certain amount of peace in 
productivity together and also to 

740
00:47:25,831 --> 00:47:30,831
establish a value system with whatever 
is that the pinnacle of the hierarchy 

741
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:37,720
regarded as whatever's most valuable.
Now think about what happens in the lion

742
00:47:37,721 --> 00:47:39,250
king.
It's a,

743
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:44,730
it's a voyage into what's most valuable.
It's an examination of what's most 

744
00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:49,141
valuable.
Now the old kingdom is threatened by 

745
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:55,340
scar.
Scar is the evil king of the evil 

746
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:57,710
brother of the king.
The king is the PR,

747
00:47:57,790 --> 00:48:01,150
the entity that inhabits the pinnacle of
the pyramid.

748
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:06,280
The king always has an evil brother and 
you knew that as well,

749
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:11,940
and the reason for that is that there is
no hierarchy that's so pristine that it 

750
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:15,511
isn't threatened by corruption and scars
presented as a resentful intellect,

751
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:18,160
and that's a very common trope as well.

752
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:21,160
That's the evil scientist idea.
It's not the only.

753
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:24,310
Only the evil scientist idea.
It's the mad scientist.

754
00:48:24,311 --> 00:48:26,380
It's the evil genius.
God.

755
00:48:26,381 --> 00:48:31,381
How many movies with a mythological 
substrate have come out in the last 20 

756
00:48:31,381 --> 00:48:34,480
years that prominently feature an evil 
genius?

757
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:39,040
It's like there's dozens of them.
There's an inexhaustible hunger for that

758
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:42,220
representation,
meaning the last avengers movie,

759
00:48:42,221 --> 00:48:43,530
you had fat it toast,
right?

760
00:48:43,531 --> 00:48:48,531
He was basically the spirit of death.
Who was an evil genius who thinks that 

761
00:48:48,531 --> 00:48:52,320
mass extinction is the answer to the 
population problem of let's say the 

762
00:48:52,601 --> 00:48:56,260
world.
Something to think about very seriously.

763
00:48:56,950 --> 00:49:01,950
While the reason for that is that this 
estate is always threatened by 

764
00:49:01,950 --> 00:49:05,880
malevolence always.
The hierarchy can always be become 

765
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:09,120
corrupt and tyrannical,
and that those are the forces of 

766
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:12,961
malevolence.
Let's say they're conspiring behind the 

767
00:49:12,961 --> 00:49:15,511
scenes tend to tilt every hierarchy 
towards tyranny and the proper attitude 

768
00:49:17,470 --> 00:49:22,470
to take towards that universal truth is 
to stay in the light and keep your damn 

769
00:49:22,931 --> 00:49:27,931
eyes open and so well what happens in 
the lion king is that the evil brother 

770
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:34,360
overthrows the rightful king,
and that again is an unbelievably common

771
00:49:34,361 --> 00:49:34,780
idea.

772
00:49:34,810 --> 00:49:39,810
You see that idea echo throat,
the mythological landscape for 

773
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:43,291
centuries,
and the reason for that is it happens 

774
00:49:43,291 --> 00:49:43,840
all the time.
That's what happened in Nazi Germany.

775
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:48,070
That's what's happened in most of the 
tyrannical societies of the world,

776
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:51,160
and most societies in the world are 
tyrannical.

777
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:56,910
There's always the possibility that the 
hierarchies that we live in will become 

778
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:59,050
corrupt and counterproductive,
and there's multiple reasons for that,

779
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:02,770
but there is summed up in the 
malevolence of the arrogant intellect.

780
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,630
It's something like that.
That's it.

781
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:08,950
That's a very common idea.
That's the character of Milton Satan,

782
00:50:08,951 --> 00:50:13,951
by the way,
because he's the ultimate in arrogant 

783
00:50:13,951 --> 00:50:13,951
intellect.
Milton,

784
00:50:13,951 --> 00:50:18,241
Satan is the figure who believes that 
his knowledge is sufficient to do 

785
00:50:18,241 --> 00:50:22,351
without the transcendent,
to do without the idea that there's 

786
00:50:22,351 --> 00:50:24,130
something beyond or that there's still 
something to learn.

787
00:50:24,370 --> 00:50:29,370
All I know is all that I need to know,
which is exactly the belief of the 

788
00:50:29,370 --> 00:50:30,440
fundamental tyrant.

789
00:50:32,810 --> 00:50:36,950
The evil brother of the king kills the 
king.

790
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:39,560
Simba loses his father.
Well,

791
00:50:39,561 --> 00:50:44,561
that's another common idea because 
everyone loses their father in some 

792
00:50:44,561 --> 00:50:48,341
sense.
People grow up and become cynical as 

793
00:50:48,341 --> 00:50:49,430
teenagers and the reason they become 
cynical as teenagers is because they see

794
00:50:49,431 --> 00:50:54,431
that the corruption of the state is 
sufficient to undermine their confidence

795
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:58,790
in the benevolence of the state and they
get cynical prematurely because what the

796
00:50:58,791 --> 00:51:03,791
hell do you know when you're a teenager,
but you're encouraged in your cynicism 

797
00:51:03,791 --> 00:51:05,300
frequently in our culture,
which is a very bad idea.

798
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:06,290
You know,
I mean,

799
00:51:06,291 --> 00:51:11,291
even though it is the case that the 
structure is always threatened by 

800
00:51:11,291 --> 00:51:12,200
malevolence,
let's say,

801
00:51:12,201 --> 00:51:17,201
and and human weakness.
Simba ends up fatherless and lost and 

802
00:51:18,351 --> 00:51:21,230
alienated from his kingdom,
just like King Arthur.

803
00:51:22,070 --> 00:51:27,070
It's the same story.
The king is often the rightful king is 

804
00:51:27,070 --> 00:51:30,401
often dissociated from his kingdom and 
forced to occupy a domain that's outside

805
00:51:30,981 --> 00:51:33,500
the kingdom and that's what happens to 
Simba.

806
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:36,500
He loses his father and what happens,
he's.

807
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:41,120
He adopts the lifestyle of an impulsive 
adolescent.

808
00:51:42,350 --> 00:51:47,350
That's what happens,
and so he's out there in no man's land 

809
00:51:47,350 --> 00:51:51,761
with his useless teenage friends doing 
nothing of any good except living for 

810
00:51:52,881 --> 00:51:57,881
the moment,
and that's the nihilistic retreat from 

811
00:51:57,881 --> 00:51:59,600
the corrupt state and no wonder,
and you might say,

812
00:51:59,601 --> 00:52:01,160
well,
if the state is corrupt,

813
00:52:01,161 --> 00:52:04,250
why should I participate in it's 
maintenance?

814
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:09,730
Why should I do anything that's useful?
If all I'm doing is furthering the 

815
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:13,181
development of a corrupt state,
and I would say the message in the most 

816
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:17,180
pathological university disciplines the 
activist disciplines,

817
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:21,260
that's exactly the message that they're 
particularly putting out two young men,

818
00:52:21,261 --> 00:52:23,750
which is you live in a corrupt 
patriarchy,

819
00:52:24,230 --> 00:52:28,430
and that means any attempts that you 
make to further yourself in this life as

820
00:52:28,431 --> 00:52:30,680
an individual with regards to your 
family,

821
00:52:30,770 --> 00:52:35,060
another corrupt patriarchal institution 
with regards to marriage or career,

822
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:38,210
that all that is is furthering the 
corrupt patriarchy.

823
00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:43,630
Everything you do that you think is good
in the productive sense is actually 

824
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:45,020
doing nothing but contributing to this 
catastrophic,

825
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:48,170
tyrannical patriarchy,
very demoralizing,

826
00:52:48,350 --> 00:52:53,350
but also opens the door for you to be as
useless as you possibly can because 

827
00:52:53,350 --> 00:52:58,180
there's always a temptation in that 
direction because it's easier and you 

828
00:52:58,180 --> 00:52:58,220
can justify it by saying,
well,

829
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:03,700
if I did anything productive,
all he would be doing is furthering the 

830
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:07,240
dominance of the corrupt system anyways,
and if you haven't met people who think 

831
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:12,011
that way,
then you haven't met very many people 

832
00:53:12,011 --> 00:53:13,730
because that's an unbelievably common 
way of thinking and it's an excuse,

833
00:53:13,731 --> 00:53:18,731
but it's.
It's also a logical reaction to the 

834
00:53:18,731 --> 00:53:21,851
confusion of competence with power.
That's part and parcel of the 

835
00:53:21,851 --> 00:53:25,511
collectivist landscape,
so Simba grows up so to speak,

836
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:31,040
gets older,
at least playing this impulsive day to 

837
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,360
day game.
Rule seven in my book is due.

838
00:53:33,361 --> 00:53:35,640
What is meaningful?
Not what is expedient,

839
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:36,950
and of course,
symbols.

840
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:41,160
Lifestyle outside the rightful kingdom 
is nothing but expedience.

841
00:53:41,161 --> 00:53:44,700
It's impulsive pleasure,
and that lasts until,

842
00:53:45,570 --> 00:53:50,570
until what?
Until his old girlfriend shows up Nela 

843
00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:56,330
and she's been dealing with the 
catastrophe of the state and maybe 

844
00:53:56,330 --> 00:53:56,330
that's because

845
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:58,330
women,

846
00:53:59,810 --> 00:54:04,810
the demands of family fall heavier on 
women at least initially and so there 

847
00:54:06,101 --> 00:54:08,690
are more sensitive to the catastrophe of
the state.

848
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:13,790
Now let's shows up and says to Simba,
what the hell do you think you're doing?

849
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:17,510
You're useless.
I liked you when you were a kid.

850
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:22,600
Here you are.
You're completely useless and 

851
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:25,061
everything's falling apart and the state
has become corrupt and there isn't 

852
00:54:25,061 --> 00:54:27,941
enough to eat and there's things that 
need to be done and he falls in love 

853
00:54:27,941 --> 00:54:31,991
with her of course,
probably because she criticizes him and 

854
00:54:31,991 --> 00:54:36,610
and then he's deeply ashamed of himself 
because she rejects him because he's 

855
00:54:36,610 --> 00:54:41,321
useless and so she should reject him 
because he's useless and if she didn't 

856
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:44,360
then he'd never figured out why I was 
useless and do something about it.

857
00:54:44,361 --> 00:54:47,150
And that's when he meets his father.
Remember,

858
00:54:47,151 --> 00:54:52,151
there's an initiation seen there.
The wise old baboon who was supposed to 

859
00:54:52,151 --> 00:54:55,991
be a fool and in the early drafts of the
movie guides him down under ground so 

860
00:54:55,991 --> 00:55:00,100
that he can reflect upon himself,
which is what he does in a pool down in,

861
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:05,150
in the underworld,
and what he sees reflected in his own 

862
00:55:05,150 --> 00:55:06,470
face is the spirit of his dead father.

863
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:10,370
Mature face symbol looks like this,
right?

864
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:11,960
He looks like a deer,
caught in headlights.

865
00:55:11,961 --> 00:55:16,961
The animators have done a really good 
job of capturing that naive and sort of 

866
00:55:18,681 --> 00:55:23,681
rotten old adolescent innocence.
It's outlived its utility and but his 

867
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:29,321
father has a very set face which means 
he's integrated his aggression and he 

868
00:55:29,321 --> 00:55:34,091
sees his father in the water and then he
sees his father in the sky and his 

869
00:55:34,091 --> 00:55:37,160
father says,
you've forgotten who you are.

870
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:42,800
Wake the hell up.
Grow the hell up there or things to fix.

871
00:55:42,910 --> 00:55:44,690
There are.
There are things to fix.

872
00:55:44,691 --> 00:55:48,500
There's responsibilities to take on and 
so

873
00:55:50,650 --> 00:55:55,650
simplest rather shocked by this 
encounter and decides to leave his false

874
00:55:56,381 --> 00:56:00,100
adolescent paradise and to go back to 
the catastrophic.

875
00:56:00,101 --> 00:56:05,101
Lee demolished state and he takes his 
friends and he sees this place that 

876
00:56:05,101 --> 00:56:10,020
where there's nothing but starvation and
cruelty and malevolence and tyranny,

877
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:15,480
and he fights a battle against evil and 
he reclaims his kingdom and as soon as 

878
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:19,261
that happens,
the rain falls and the plants grow and 

879
00:56:19,261 --> 00:56:23,020
harmony is restored and that's fascist 
mysticism by the way,

880
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:28,680
so it seems to appeal to a very large 
number of people given the popularity of

881
00:56:29,711 --> 00:56:31,480
that movie.
And what is that?

882
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:33,550
What's it called?
A responsibility.

883
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:35,920
It's a fundamental call to 
responsibility,

884
00:56:36,790 --> 00:56:39,700
right?
Is that it is the case that we live in a

885
00:56:40,510 --> 00:56:45,510
field.
It's defined by the extent of our 

886
00:56:45,510 --> 00:56:47,551
vision.
It is the case that we live in a 

887
00:56:47,551 --> 00:56:47,980
hierarchical structure on that plane.

888
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:51,010
It is the case that there's a kingship 
at the top.

889
00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:55,150
It is the case that that's always 
threatened by malevolence in sin.

890
00:56:55,690 --> 00:56:59,950
It is the case that that can make you 
corrupt and cynical and irresponsible.

891
00:57:00,310 --> 00:57:05,310
It is the case that that's the 
inappropriate response and that it's 

892
00:57:05,310 --> 00:57:09,601
your responsibility to repair the damage
structure of tradition,

893
00:57:10,210 --> 00:57:14,290
despite the fact that it veers towards 
corruption.

894
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:18,370
It is the case that if you take that 
responsibility on yourself,

895
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:21,640
that the rain falls again and everything
flourishes.

896
00:57:22,450 --> 00:57:27,450
It's correct.
It's the right way of looking at the 

897
00:57:27,450 --> 00:57:30,151
world and if we didn't know that deeply,
everyone in this room wouldn't have 

898
00:57:30,151 --> 00:57:32,530
watched that movie and you think,
well,

899
00:57:32,531 --> 00:57:36,670
it's so strange that we can watch that 
movie without understanding it.

900
00:57:37,270 --> 00:57:39,250
Right?
You can fall into it because you do.

901
00:57:39,550 --> 00:57:41,200
When you go to,
you might wonder,

902
00:57:41,201 --> 00:57:43,810
well,
do people have religious experiences?

903
00:57:44,110 --> 00:57:46,960
Because people wonder about the truth of
religion,

904
00:57:46,961 --> 00:57:50,050
let's say,
and I'm not going to go very deeply into

905
00:57:50,051 --> 00:57:55,051
that issue,
but I can tell you that what you're 

906
00:57:55,051 --> 00:57:56,731
doing when you go to a movie like that 
that has that mythological structure and

907
00:57:57,161 --> 00:58:00,220
you fall into it,
which is what you do,

908
00:58:00,490 --> 00:58:05,490
that what you're having is absolutely 
indistinguishable from a religious 

909
00:58:05,490 --> 00:58:08,551
experience.
It's the revelation of knowledge that 

910
00:58:08,551 --> 00:58:08,770
you know,
but you don't know.

911
00:58:08,771 --> 00:58:11,740
You know,
and there's something about it that's so

912
00:58:11,741 --> 00:58:16,741
deeply engaging and meaningful that you 
will line up and pay for the privilege 

913
00:58:17,201 --> 00:58:22,201
of being exposed to it,
and this is not an easy thing to 

914
00:58:22,201 --> 00:58:22,201
understand.
I think if you bring,

915
00:58:22,201 --> 00:58:27,030
your child will be very excited about 
the possibility of going to the lion 

916
00:58:27,030 --> 00:58:27,370
king.
Right,

917
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:31,150
and maybe want to watch it 20 times.
My son watched the,

918
00:58:31,610 --> 00:58:34,840
did the whale scene in Pinocchio,
a bed.

919
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:38,440
He watched that 115 times when he was 
four or five years old.

920
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:41,890
He just watched it over and over and 
over and over.

921
00:58:42,070 --> 00:58:43,420
I thought,
what the hell are you doing,

922
00:58:43,421 --> 00:58:44,500
kid?
You know,

923
00:58:44,770 --> 00:58:46,600
I mean,
it was so interesting to watch that.

924
00:58:46,601 --> 00:58:51,601
He was so obsessed by it,
but there's a tremendous amount of 

925
00:58:51,601 --> 00:58:54,781
information in that movie,
like an almost unlimited amount of 

926
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:56,650
information and he was gripped by it and
was trying.

927
00:58:56,950 --> 00:59:01,950
However it is that a child's imagination
tries to come to terms with what the 

928
00:59:02,350 --> 00:59:05,170
movie was representing and it wasn't 
like he enjoyed it.

929
00:59:05,950 --> 00:59:07,780
Not at all.
Not In the least.

930
00:59:07,781 --> 00:59:08,830
You know?
And if you.

931
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:09,410
Well,
if you,

932
00:59:09,411 --> 00:59:14,411
if you watch the scene,
how many of you have seen the Movie 

933
00:59:14,411 --> 00:59:14,411
Pinocchio?
Okay.

934
00:59:14,411 --> 00:59:17,170
So it's the same thing.
It's one of the 10 most highest grossing

935
00:59:17,171 --> 00:59:18,430
movies of all time.
By the way,

936
00:59:19,870 --> 00:59:21,710
there's a scene where Pinocchio who's 
turned in,

937
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:26,740
he's a wooden puppet who's been turned 
into a jackass and for some which is 

938
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:27,710
supposed to make sense to you and 
apparently does,

939
00:59:28,210 --> 00:59:33,210
and he goes to the bottom of the ocean 
to rescue his father who was somehow 

940
00:59:33,210 --> 00:59:33,980
swallowed by a whale.

941
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:39,070
So think about what you're watching.
You're watching a drawing of a puppet 

942
00:59:39,070 --> 00:59:41,540
turned into a Jack Ass,
go to the bottom of the ocean and rescue

943
00:59:41,541 --> 00:59:46,070
his father from a fire breathing whale 
and you're all perfectly okay with that.

944
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:48,710
Right?
So it's very peculiar.

945
00:59:48,890 --> 00:59:50,510
And so,
and it's very frightening.

946
00:59:50,570 --> 00:59:55,570
Like the whale is a while.
It does breathe fire because it's 

947
00:59:55,570 --> 00:59:56,300
actually a dragon,
not a whale.

948
00:59:56,650 --> 00:59:58,670
And,
and they,

949
00:59:58,730 --> 01:00:01,950
the animators used locomotive noises to,
to,

950
01:00:02,110 --> 01:00:07,110
to add the audio background and the 
whale is hell bent on destroying the 

951
01:00:07,371 --> 01:00:09,920
hero of the story.
Pinocchio and also Japan.

952
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:14,270
And it's a very tense scene.
And so my son was just like this,

953
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:16,520
like the whole time watching it.
It wasn't.

954
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:18,620
You wouldn't think that he would,
you know,

955
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:23,680
he's like these terrified,
like a rabbit who is being watched by a 

956
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:26,060
wolf and then it makes his heartbeat and
these all exhausted and it goes,

957
01:00:26,150 --> 01:00:28,370
and then the first thing he wants to do 
is to do it again.

958
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:30,110
It's like,
what the Hell's going?

959
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:30,540
Well,
what?

960
01:00:30,541 --> 01:00:32,910
What's going on there?
It's not like it's a cake walk.

961
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:38,140
It's not that at all.
It's like he could hardly even stand to 

962
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:38,140
watch it.
It's so tense,

963
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:40,640
especially when you're for.
It's like it's bad enough when you're an

964
01:00:40,641 --> 01:00:41,330
adult,
you know,

965
01:00:41,331 --> 01:00:45,050
and you've seen a thousand things like 
that and at least in principle,

966
01:00:45,051 --> 01:00:50,051
your little tougher and a little wiser,
but when you're for that just blows you 

967
01:00:50,051 --> 01:00:53,411
away like,
like everything in the world does and 

968
01:00:53,411 --> 01:00:56,051
yet all he would do is expose himself to
it over and over and over and over and 

969
01:00:56,051 --> 01:00:56,051
over.
And in the lion king,

970
01:00:56,051 --> 01:00:58,160
like if you watch children when they go 
see that,

971
01:00:58,161 --> 01:01:00,140
they're just demolished.
When Simba,

972
01:01:00,141 --> 01:01:01,760
his father dies,
right?

973
01:01:01,761 --> 01:01:06,761
Just tears them apart.
They can't believe that you know the 

974
01:01:06,761 --> 01:01:10,001
king has disappeared and yet they'll 
watch it over and over and over and over

975
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:12,890
just like you do,
and it's because,

976
01:01:12,891 --> 01:01:17,891
well,
the whole story we used to tell our son 

977
01:01:17,891 --> 01:01:20,500
when we took them to movies because he'd
get all shorted out by what was 

978
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:23,150
happening and unsurprisingly,
watch the hero.

979
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:28,900
Keep your eye on the hero because that's
the pathway through and that's exactly 

980
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:33,290
right because you're supposed to keep 
your eye on the hero because that is the

981
01:01:33,291 --> 01:01:37,730
pathway through and there isn't anything
that's more true than that.

982
01:01:38,510 --> 01:01:41,120
That's a true story.
You think,

983
01:01:41,121 --> 01:01:42,170
well,
it's fictional.

984
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:47,260
It's like fiction presents abstractions.
Abstractions aren't falsehoods.

985
01:01:48,850 --> 01:01:51,740
They're abstractions.
Think about numbers.

986
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:57,700
Numbers are abstractions.
They're abstracted away from individual 

987
01:01:57,700 --> 01:01:59,540
entities in the real world,
but if you know the numbers,

988
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:02,540
you know abstractions of tremendous 
truth.

989
01:02:03,710 --> 01:02:08,710
While the abstraction of the idea of the
individual hero from the collective of 

990
01:02:08,710 --> 01:02:12,890
human action is the abstraction of it's 
more true than true.

991
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:17,270
Deep fiction is more true than truth.
That's a way of thinking about it.

992
01:02:17,390 --> 01:02:22,390
It's more real than reality itself.
In the same way that an abstraction can 

993
01:02:22,531 --> 01:02:27,120
be more real than the thing that it's 
abstracted from all of the,

994
01:02:28,950 --> 01:02:33,950
all of the landscape in a mythological 
tale like the lion king is an abstract 

995
01:02:34,621 --> 01:02:35,400
landscape.

996
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:39,780
What's common across all landscapes?
Well,

997
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:42,990
wherever you go,
there are things that you know and there

998
01:02:42,991 --> 01:02:47,991
are things that you don't know and 
that's the human world and it doesn't 

999
01:02:47,991 --> 01:02:51,990
matter who the human being is.
You might know more than you do,

1000
01:02:52,290 --> 01:02:57,290
but doesn't matter because your 
knowledge is still bounded by your 

1001
01:02:57,290 --> 01:03:00,680
limitless ignorance and the possibility 
that that domain of limitless ignorance 

1002
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:03,870
will make mockery of what you know at 
any moment.

1003
01:03:04,270 --> 01:03:09,270
It's a reality and it's a universal 
reality and you have to orient yourself 

1004
01:03:10,291 --> 01:03:14,970
in that landscape and so does everyone 
else.

1005
01:03:15,450 --> 01:03:20,450
You have to deal with what you knew and 
what you don't know everywhere and the 

1006
01:03:20,450 --> 01:03:23,931
way you do that is by straddling the 
divide between what you know and what 

1007
01:03:23,931 --> 01:03:27,471
you don't know.
You do that by staying firmly grounded 

1008
01:03:27,471 --> 01:03:32,030
to some degree in what you understand,
but by putting a tentative foot outward 

1009
01:03:32,030 --> 01:03:34,650
into what you don't understand so that 
you can remain stable,

1010
01:03:34,651 --> 01:03:38,700
but you can stretch yourself and 
challenge yourself simultaneously.

1011
01:03:39,210 --> 01:03:41,130
Right,
and that's the proper place to stand and

1012
01:03:41,131 --> 01:03:46,131
that's actually a real place.
That's the line between chaos and order 

1013
01:03:46,131 --> 01:03:47,580
and that's the place of meaning.
Rule six,

1014
01:03:47,581 --> 01:03:48,840
again,
real seventies,

1015
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:54,080
do what is meaningful,
not what is expedient and when you do 

1016
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:57,501
what is meaningful,
you stay in the kingdom that you've 

1017
01:03:57,501 --> 01:04:01,401
established,
but you don't stay completely in it 

1018
01:04:01,401 --> 01:04:04,940
because you need to challenge yourself 
and grow and so you put one foot 

1019
01:04:05,850 --> 01:04:10,850
tentatively out into the domain that 
supersedes your competence and you 

1020
01:04:12,391 --> 01:04:14,790
maintain stability and grow at the same 
time,

1021
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:20,180
and when you're doing that properly,
then the psychological consequences of 

1022
01:04:22,021 --> 01:04:26,280
that is the immersement in a meaningful 
experience.

1023
01:04:27,090 --> 01:04:30,060
It said deep instinct.
So when you know,

1024
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:31,470
if you watch yourself,
you say,

1025
01:04:31,471 --> 01:04:33,330
well,
I had a particularly good day at work,

1026
01:04:33,630 --> 01:04:35,820
and what does that mean?
Well,

1027
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:39,300
it means that you lost your sense of 
time,

1028
01:04:40,290 --> 01:04:40,500
right?

1029
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:42,120
Because when you're having not a good 
day at work,

1030
01:04:42,121 --> 01:04:47,121
it's like first it's one minute to three
and then it's 45 seconds to three and 

1031
01:04:49,531 --> 01:04:52,500
then it's 30 seconds.
That's what school was like for me.

1032
01:04:52,501 --> 01:04:57,501
It was like click.
So funny.

1033
01:04:57,841 --> 01:04:59,070
You know,
I went to,

1034
01:04:59,940 --> 01:05:03,660
I went to my daughter's school,
I used to get in trouble for talking all

1035
01:05:03,661 --> 01:05:04,680
the time,
surprise,

1036
01:05:04,681 --> 01:05:09,681
surprise when I was a kid and uh,
and I was bored stiff in school and,

1037
01:05:11,010 --> 01:05:16,010
and so I would misbehave upon occasion 
out of pure boredom and vote 21 years 

1038
01:05:19,271 --> 01:05:24,271
ago I went to my daughter's school to 
sit for a class.

1039
01:05:24,761 --> 01:05:29,761
It was about an hour long and I was 
sitting there and the teacher had all 

1040
01:05:30,011 --> 01:05:34,420
the kids on the floor and was having 
some of the kids read to the others.

1041
01:05:34,421 --> 01:05:38,260
And some of the kids who were reading 
couldn't read at all.

1042
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:40,960
And I had exactly the same experience.

1043
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:43,840
I was sitting there.
It was like being like being seven years

1044
01:05:43,841 --> 01:05:44,200
old,
ugly.

1045
01:05:44,201 --> 01:05:47,650
And I could see the clock going,
tick,

1046
01:05:48,850 --> 01:05:50,230
tick.
And I thought,

1047
01:05:50,290 --> 01:05:55,290
you know,
if I was in this classroom for three 

1048
01:05:55,290 --> 01:05:55,290
days,
I would misbehave,

1049
01:05:55,290 --> 01:05:58,820
fit 40 years old,
I would miss behave exactly like ty did 

1050
01:05:58,820 --> 01:06:01,900
when I was when I was six.
No.

1051
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:03,910
Well,
that's no place to be right,

1052
01:06:03,911 --> 01:06:08,911
because that's.
You don't want to be in a place that 

1053
01:06:08,911 --> 01:06:08,911
stultifying you don't want to be in a 
place where there's no challenge.

1054
01:06:08,911 --> 01:06:10,900
You might even quit your job if there's 
no challenge.

1055
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:12,400
Say,
well that's a good job.

1056
01:06:12,401 --> 01:06:14,020
It gives you security and you think,
God,

1057
01:06:14,021 --> 01:06:16,150
I can't stand this.
It's eating away at my soul.

1058
01:06:16,390 --> 01:06:19,780
It's all security and no challenge.
So why do you want to challenge?

1059
01:06:20,230 --> 01:06:25,230
Because that's what you're built for.
That's what you're built for your built 

1060
01:06:25,230 --> 01:06:26,890
to take on a maximal load,
right?

1061
01:06:26,890 --> 01:06:31,890
Because that's what strengthens you and 
you need to be strong because life is 

1062
01:06:31,890 --> 01:06:35,041
extraordinarily difficult and because 
the evil king is always whittling away 

1063
01:06:35,041 --> 01:06:39,271
at the structure of the state and you 
have to be awake and sharp to stop that 

1064
01:06:39,271 --> 01:06:42,811
from happening so that you don't become 
corrupt and so that your family doesn't 

1065
01:06:42,811 --> 01:06:45,820
become corrupt and so that your state 
doesn't have to be come become corrupt.

1066
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:51,000
You have to have your eyes open and your
which sharp and your words at the ready 

1067
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,660
and you have to be educated and you have
to know about your history and you know 

1068
01:06:54,660 --> 01:06:56,320
have to know how to think and you have 
to know how to read and you have to know

1069
01:06:56,321 --> 01:07:01,321
how to speak and you have to know how to
aim and you have to be willing to hoist 

1070
01:07:01,321 --> 01:07:02,680
the troubles of the world upon your 
shoulders.

1071
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:05,890
And what's so interesting about that?
So remarkable.

1072
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:10,980
And this is something that's really 
manifested itself to me as I've been 

1073
01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:14,731
doing these public lectures.
I've been talking about responsibility 

1074
01:07:14,731 --> 01:07:17,581
to people,
which doesn't seem to happen very often 

1075
01:07:17,581 --> 01:07:17,650
anymore.
And the audiences are dead quiet.

1076
01:07:18,010 --> 01:07:22,390
And I lay out this idea that life is 
tragedy tainted by malevolence,

1077
01:07:22,391 --> 01:07:23,590
and everyone says,
yeah,

1078
01:07:23,591 --> 01:07:27,520
well we already always suspected that no
one has ever said it quite so bluntly,

1079
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:32,640
and it's quite a relief to hear that I'm
not the only person who has those 

1080
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:36,691
suspicions.
And then the second part of that is the 

1081
01:07:36,691 --> 01:07:36,700
better part,
and it's the optimistic part,

1082
01:07:36,701 --> 01:07:41,701
which is despite the fact that life is a
tragedy tainted by malevolence at every 

1083
01:07:43,631 --> 01:07:46,720
level of existence,
there's something about the human spirit

1084
01:07:46,721 --> 01:07:51,721
that can thrive under precisely those 
conditions if we allow that to occur.

1085
01:07:52,570 --> 01:07:56,680
Because as difficult as life is and as 
horrible as we are,

1086
01:07:57,010 --> 01:08:02,010
our capacity to deal with that 
catastrophe and to transcend that 

1087
01:08:02,111 --> 01:08:06,520
malevolent spirit is more powerful than 
the than that reality itself.

1088
01:08:06,790 --> 01:08:11,790
And that's the fundamental issue.
I think that's the fundamental issue of 

1089
01:08:11,790 --> 01:08:14,980
the Judaeo Christian ethic with its 
emphasis on the divinity,

1090
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:20,080
the individual as catastrophic as life 
is and is malevolent as people can be,

1091
01:08:20,990 --> 01:08:25,310
and that's malevolent beyond belief.
Fundamentally,

1092
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:31,520
the a person has in spirit that nobility
to set that right and to defeat evil and

1093
01:08:33,501 --> 01:08:38,501
that and that more than that and that 
the antidote to the catastrophe of life 

1094
01:08:38,571 --> 01:08:43,571
and the suffering of life and the 
tragedy of life that can drive you down 

1095
01:08:43,571 --> 01:08:47,411
and destroy you,
is to take on exactly that 

1096
01:08:47,411 --> 01:08:47,780
responsibility and to say,
well,

1097
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:52,840
there's plenty of work to be done and 
isn't that terrible and there isn't 

1098
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:56,921
anything so bad that we can't make it 
worse and certainly try very hard to do 

1099
01:08:57,141 --> 01:09:02,141
so,
but I have it within me to decide that 

1100
01:09:02,141 --> 01:09:05,711
I'm going to stand up against that.
I'm going to strive to make the world a 

1101
01:09:05,711 --> 01:09:05,711
better place.

1102
01:09:05,711 --> 01:09:09,730
I'm going to strive to constrain the 
malevolence that's in my own heart and 

1103
01:09:09,730 --> 01:09:13,571
to set my family's straight and to work 
to work despite my tragic loss,

1104
01:09:14,270 --> 01:09:17,570
for the betterment of anything,
of everything that's in front of me.

1105
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:22,720
And the consequence of that.
The immediate consequence of that is 

1106
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:26,270
that when you make the decision to take 
on all of that voluntarily,

1107
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:28,640
which is to stand up straight,
by the way,

1108
01:09:28,790 --> 01:09:30,950
with your shoulders back,
to take on that,

1109
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:34,730
all that on voluntarily.
As soon as you make that decision,

1110
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:40,000
then all the catastrophe justifies 
itself in the nobility of your striving 

1111
01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:43,940
and that's what it means to be an 
individual.

1112
01:09:50,610 --> 01:09:55,320
Thanks.

1113
01:10:03,420 --> 01:10:05,070
This one,
this one is good.

1114
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:10,100
The first one here.
What's your take on universal income?

1115
01:10:12,390 --> 01:10:17,390
Is it a fast track to new communism,
capitalism killer or a possible way out 

1116
01:10:18,601 --> 01:10:21,630
of starvation for humanity?
Thank you.

1117
01:10:22,850 --> 01:10:27,850
Well,
I don't think it addresses the 

1118
01:10:27,850 --> 01:10:28,300
fundamental problem.
I think it's.

1119
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:33,720
I think it's a mirror of the rights 
responsibility problem.

1120
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:35,700
No,
you might say,

1121
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:42,120
well,
everyone has a right to the basics of 

1122
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:42,120
life.
First of all,

1123
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:46,291
that's a debatable proposition because 
the question is who's going to provide 

1124
01:10:46,781 --> 01:10:51,781
those necessities and the answer 
shouldn't be someone else under 

1125
01:10:51,781 --> 01:10:55,621
compulsion,
so because each rate comes at the 

1126
01:10:56,151 --> 01:11:00,080
expense of someone else's responsibility
and so you don't want to multiply rights

1127
01:11:00,081 --> 01:11:00,620
beyond

1128
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:06,900
minimum necessity because you also 
multiply diverse responsibilities beyond

1129
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:10,870
tolerance.
But more importantly than that,

1130
01:11:11,230 --> 01:11:15,660
I would say is that let's make it more 
concrete.

1131
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:20,220
So let's imagine that as the 
technological revolution progresses,

1132
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:26,540
more and more people will be in danger 
of being replaced by intelligent 

1133
01:11:26,540 --> 01:11:27,540
machines.
Now we don't know if that's true because

1134
01:11:27,541 --> 01:11:29,610
it hasn't happened yet,
right?

1135
01:11:29,611 --> 01:11:33,150
And everyone has been predicting that 
that was going to happen since like 1960

1136
01:11:33,151 --> 01:11:38,151
and it hasn't happened,
and so there may be an infinite amount 

1137
01:11:38,151 --> 01:11:38,160
of work and we're never going to run out
of work.

1138
01:11:38,161 --> 01:11:43,161
I suspect that's probably the case,
but let's assume that people do get 

1139
01:11:43,161 --> 01:11:44,940
dispossessed as technology's 
transformed,

1140
01:11:45,180 --> 01:11:50,180
and then we have the problem of the 
development of people for who have no 

1141
01:11:50,430 --> 01:11:54,390
viable means of making a living.
And the question might be,

1142
01:11:54,420 --> 01:11:56,310
well,
what's the fundamental problem there?

1143
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:58,830
And one answer is while they don't have 
any money,

1144
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:02,220
but I actually don't think that that is 
the fundamental problem.

1145
01:12:03,270 --> 01:12:08,270
I've had many people in my clinical 
practice who were unemployed and had 

1146
01:12:08,270 --> 01:12:09,870
money.
Now they didn't have a lot of money,

1147
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:14,760
but they had enough money and enough 
money to keep privation at bay,

1148
01:12:14,761 --> 01:12:16,590
let's say,
and enough money to.

1149
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:22,040
Well that was the rub,
enough money to get themselves into 

1150
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:23,640
plenty of trouble and so one of my 
clients,

1151
01:12:23,641 --> 01:12:24,690
for example,
was a.

1152
01:12:25,410 --> 01:12:27,390
I liked him quite a lot and he had,
he was,

1153
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:32,510
he had worked in a hospital and he'd 
been hurt and and then he got onto 

1154
01:12:33,421 --> 01:12:38,421
painkillers because he'd been hurt and 
then he got addicted to painkillers and 

1155
01:12:38,421 --> 01:12:41,901
then he got addicted to cocaine and his 
life took a bad nosedive and he is 

1156
01:12:43,501 --> 01:12:45,150
actually pretty good unless he had 
money.

1157
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:47,820
But as soon as he had a check,
it was,

1158
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:49,590
he was gone.
He was in a ditch,

1159
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:51,000
he was in a bar.

1160
01:12:51,630 --> 01:12:56,630
He spent all his money and he was face 
down in the ditch and that's where he 

1161
01:12:56,630 --> 01:13:00,111
woke up the next day.
And the reason I'm telling you that 

1162
01:13:00,111 --> 01:13:01,410
story is because it wasn't that he 
didn't have money.

1163
01:13:01,411 --> 01:13:03,030
That wasn't the problem.
Really.

1164
01:13:03,390 --> 01:13:05,370
The problem was that he didn't have a 
purpose.

1165
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:10,520
He didn't have a place anymore.
He got thrown out of the structure that 

1166
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:13,560
would have enabled him to find 
productive meaning,

1167
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:14,550
you know,
when you might've said,

1168
01:13:14,551 --> 01:13:16,020
well,
he should have been able to conjure that

1169
01:13:16,021 --> 01:13:18,090
up on his own and perhaps that's the 
case.

1170
01:13:18,091 --> 01:13:21,150
Although he wasn't the world's most 
sophisticated person,

1171
01:13:21,750 --> 01:13:26,750
you know,
when people very substantially in their 

1172
01:13:26,750 --> 01:13:26,750
sophistication and it and he didn't have
a good family,

1173
01:13:26,750 --> 01:13:28,290
he didn't have a support network around 
him.

1174
01:13:28,291 --> 01:13:33,291
He was kind of a last character in many,
many ways and so it was easy for him to 

1175
01:13:33,291 --> 01:13:37,371
fall out of the world,
which is what he did and providing him 

1176
01:13:37,371 --> 01:13:41,151
with money was not going to fix that and
says what is going to fix that?

1177
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:44,250
Well,
that's a good question.

1178
01:13:44,251 --> 01:13:45,220
I mean,
we,

1179
01:13:45,290 --> 01:13:50,290
we have a program,
some of you people might be interested 

1180
01:13:50,290 --> 01:13:50,670
in it,
it's called.

1181
01:13:51,030 --> 01:13:56,030
It's part of a suite of online writing 
programs called the self authoring 

1182
01:13:56,030 --> 01:13:59,520
suite.
It's outsell faltering Dotcom and one of

1183
01:13:59,521 --> 01:14:04,521
the programs is called future authoring.
And we've experimented with this program

1184
01:14:05,310 --> 01:14:08,130
in an attempt to address this problem.
Okay.

1185
01:14:08,131 --> 01:14:11,920
So I mentioned to you tonight idea that

1186
01:14:12,490 --> 01:14:17,170
we live out a story and we need a 
purpose to live out that story properly,

1187
01:14:17,171 --> 01:14:19,750
and what that implies is that you need a
purpose.

1188
01:14:20,020 --> 01:14:21,640
You need a point,
you need a name,

1189
01:14:22,290 --> 01:14:25,930
you need to precise same.
You need an aim that's of sufficient

1190
01:14:28,250 --> 01:14:30,470
nobility.
I can't think of any other word,

1191
01:14:30,650 --> 01:14:35,650
sufficient nobility to justify your 
miserable existence even to yourself and

1192
01:14:36,051 --> 01:14:39,920
you need to develop that aim.
And so we built this program.

1193
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:45,280
I started working on it about 15 years 
ago when I was giving my students 

1194
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:49,121
exercises to do university and one of 
the exercises I had them do was that 

1195
01:14:49,461 --> 01:14:54,461
they had to pick a small problem maybe 
in their family or their room and fix 

1196
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:56,240
it,
not try to fix it,

1197
01:14:56,630 --> 01:14:59,930
but actually pick a problem that was 
small that they could fix,

1198
01:15:00,140 --> 01:15:02,150
clean up the cigarette butts in the 
yard,

1199
01:15:02,151 --> 01:15:05,330
outside the residence,
clean the room.

1200
01:15:05,620 --> 01:15:08,720
We had one kid whose mother had died in 
the family,

1201
01:15:08,721 --> 01:15:13,721
got kind of fragmented and he decided 
that he was going to take over the 

1202
01:15:13,721 --> 01:15:16,541
maternal duties in the household and the
kids were supposed to write about what 

1203
01:15:16,541 --> 01:15:19,841
happened when they tried to put this 
into practice because doing things like 

1204
01:15:19,841 --> 01:15:20,060
that is way more difficult than anybody 
ever realized this.

1205
01:15:20,060 --> 01:15:24,260
And so he tried to become mother and the
family needed a mother and he,

1206
01:15:24,290 --> 01:15:27,050
he encountered all sorts of terrible 
resistance,

1207
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:29,540
which is completely unsurprising.
I mean,

1208
01:15:29,541 --> 01:15:34,541
first of all,
people in his family were annoyed that 

1209
01:15:34,541 --> 01:15:34,541
he would dare to try to take their dead 
mother's place,

1210
01:15:34,541 --> 01:15:39,280
you know,
even though he was trying to do it for 

1211
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:41,110
the best of reasons.
And we played with that for a couple of 

1212
01:15:41,110 --> 01:15:44,771
years and that was very interesting.
And then I realized that I was teaching 

1213
01:15:44,771 --> 01:15:46,070
students all these stories about 
purpose,

1214
01:15:46,071 --> 01:15:51,071
but nobody had ever had them write a 
story about their purpose essentially.

1215
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:55,970
So I thought was not interesting.
Here are these,

1216
01:15:56,010 --> 01:15:56,870
these,
these kids,

1217
01:15:56,871 --> 01:16:01,871
they've been in university,
they've been in school for 15 years and 

1218
01:16:01,871 --> 01:16:05,600
no one has ever sat them down and said,
well,

1219
01:16:05,660 --> 01:16:08,090
what sort of character do you want to 
develop?

1220
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:12,020
Who should you be and why don't you 
write that out and justify it,

1221
01:16:12,290 --> 01:16:13,670
you know,
six pages,

1222
01:16:13,671 --> 01:16:18,671
something like that with the same amount
of care and attention that you might 

1223
01:16:18,671 --> 01:16:22,091
spend,
or even more on an essay about the war 

1224
01:16:22,091 --> 01:16:22,091
of 18,
12 or something like that.

1225
01:16:22,091 --> 01:16:22,580
Think,
well,

1226
01:16:22,850 --> 01:16:24,740
when the more I thought about that,
the more

1227
01:16:26,490 --> 01:16:28,980
flabbergasted I would say I became 
because I thought,

1228
01:16:28,981 --> 01:16:29,490
well,
what that,

1229
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:34,520
what,
how is it possible that we could set up 

1230
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:37,971
our education system and run people 
through it for 15 years and never have 

1231
01:16:37,971 --> 01:16:42,831
them forced so to speak,
to figure out who they wanted to be in 

1232
01:16:42,831 --> 01:16:47,761
to justify it in an articulate manner.
And so I built this program with my 

1233
01:16:47,761 --> 01:16:51,831
colleagues to help people do that.
I used my classes first and so I 

1234
01:16:51,831 --> 01:16:51,831
thought,
okay,

1235
01:16:51,831 --> 01:16:55,611
well here's the game and this is like 
rule to treat yourself like you're 

1236
01:16:55,611 --> 01:16:59,841
someone responsible for helping.
And that doesn't mean be good to 

1237
01:16:59,841 --> 01:17:01,140
yourself.
It doesn't mean me be nice to yourself.

1238
01:17:01,141 --> 01:17:06,141
It doesn't mean give yourself an easy 
life that isn't actually what you do to 

1239
01:17:06,141 --> 01:17:06,840
people.
If you care for them,

1240
01:17:07,110 --> 01:17:09,890
you actually present them with something
like an challenge.

1241
01:17:09,891 --> 01:17:10,910
That's what you do with kids.

1242
01:17:10,910 --> 01:17:15,910
If you love them,
as you present them with an optimal 

1243
01:17:15,910 --> 01:17:18,011
challenge so they can develop and grow.
So that's what you should do for 

1244
01:17:18,011 --> 01:17:18,110
yourself if you're taking care of 
yourself.

1245
01:17:18,470 --> 01:17:19,400
So I thought,
okay,

1246
01:17:19,401 --> 01:17:22,370
well here's the game.
First of all,

1247
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:27,400
assume that you're worth taking a care 
that we are worth taking care of and 

1248
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:30,911
that it's your responsibility to do so.
Even if you don't like yourself very 

1249
01:17:30,911 --> 01:17:34,061
much and lots of people don't and they 
have their reasons because everybody is 

1250
01:17:34,061 --> 01:17:34,610
very aware of their own flaws,
right?

1251
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:38,180
Unless you're narcissistic,
you're more aware of your own flaws than

1252
01:17:38,570 --> 01:17:43,570
have anyone else's flaws and maybe 
you're not very happy with yourself and 

1253
01:17:43,570 --> 01:17:46,451
you don't think that you deserve to have
an okay life and so you punish yourself 

1254
01:17:46,451 --> 01:17:48,080
and you set yourself up for failure and 
all and all of that.

1255
01:17:48,081 --> 01:17:51,800
Now it happens all the time or you just 
don't aim or you don't have any goals or

1256
01:17:52,150 --> 01:17:56,210
you know you're guilty and resentful and
feel that you should be punished,

1257
01:17:56,211 --> 01:17:57,950
so you have to abandon all that.

1258
01:17:58,970 --> 01:18:02,540
Treat yourself like you're someone 
you're responsible for helping,

1259
01:18:02,630 --> 01:18:07,630
responsible for helping.
Imagine yourself three to five years 

1260
01:18:07,630 --> 01:18:09,110
into the future.
You get to have what you need.

1261
01:18:10,730 --> 01:18:12,650
If you're taking care of yourself,
you can have it,

1262
01:18:13,190 --> 01:18:18,190
but you have to figure out what it is 
because you are not going to get it 

1263
01:18:18,190 --> 01:18:20,780
unless you aim at it,
and that's rule 10 is be precise in your

1264
01:18:20,781 --> 01:18:25,781
speech.
And the reason I wrote that rule is is 

1265
01:18:25,781 --> 01:18:28,991
because you can be bloody sure that 
you're not going to hit a target unless 

1266
01:18:28,991 --> 01:18:31,841
you a matte it,
and the more precise you make the 

1267
01:18:31,841 --> 01:18:33,581
target,
the higher the probability that you'll 

1268
01:18:33,581 --> 01:18:33,581
aim at nothing.
You'll hit it when you aim at it.

1269
01:18:33,581 --> 01:18:35,720
So what do you want?
And you think,

1270
01:18:35,721 --> 01:18:40,721
well,
I don't want to even think about what I 

1271
01:18:40,721 --> 01:18:40,721
want because as soon as I figure out 
what I want,

1272
01:18:40,721 --> 01:18:44,681
then I've made clear Mike conditions for
failure and it's the last thing I'm 

1273
01:18:44,681 --> 01:18:45,050
going to do.

1274
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:50,320
And so people envelop themselves in 
vague this so they don't have to 

1275
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:52,640
confront their own failure,
but then they fail and just don't notice

1276
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:58,300
except for maybe you know,
two decades later when it's too bloody 

1277
01:18:58,300 --> 01:19:01,691
late and then they're all catastrophic,
really hurt because they wasted their 

1278
01:19:01,691 --> 01:19:03,080
life.
It's a very bad plan.

1279
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:08,680
It's better just to figure out what you 
want and to tell yourself and then to 

1280
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:12,100
tell your partner and to tell the people
around you and maybe you can get it or 

1281
01:19:12,100 --> 01:19:13,220
maybe at least while you're struggling 
towards it,

1282
01:19:13,221 --> 01:19:16,520
you'll come up with a better plan,
which is more likely the case.

1283
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:20,510
What do you want from your family?
If you could have what you,

1284
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:25,720
what was good for you?
What do you want from your intimate 

1285
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:26,450
relationship?
How are you going to educate yourself?

1286
01:19:26,451 --> 01:19:30,800
Because you don't know enough.
What do you want for a career or job?

1287
01:19:30,860 --> 01:19:35,860
Because not everyone has a career.
How are you going to spend your time 

1288
01:19:35,860 --> 01:19:35,860
outside of work in a productive and 
meaningful manner?

1289
01:19:35,860 --> 01:19:40,780
How are you going to resist the 
temptations of drugs and alcohol and 

1290
01:19:40,780 --> 01:19:41,960
sexual misconduct,
let's say,

1291
01:19:41,961 --> 01:19:43,250
because those are the big three.

1292
01:19:45,740 --> 01:19:48,590
How are you going to maintain yourself 
physically and mentally?

1293
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:53,630
While those are seven good questions,
you can have what you want.

1294
01:19:55,710 --> 01:20:00,710
What do you want?
It's an operational realization of the 

1295
01:20:00,710 --> 01:20:04,910
new testament principle.
Ask and you will receive knock and the 

1296
01:20:04,910 --> 01:20:06,870
door will open and you think,
well,

1297
01:20:07,230 --> 01:20:09,150
there's no possibility that that's the 
case.

1298
01:20:09,151 --> 01:20:12,780
It's like actually it is the case.
If you don't specify what you want,

1299
01:20:12,781 --> 01:20:16,140
you won't get it,
and if you specify what you want and you

1300
01:20:16,141 --> 01:20:21,141
want it,
which means you're willing to make the 

1301
01:20:21,141 --> 01:20:23,451
sacrifices necessary to get it,
then the probability that you'll get it 

1302
01:20:23,451 --> 01:20:26,340
expands immensely and miraculously in 
some sense.

1303
01:20:26,580 --> 01:20:27,180
Now,
of course,

1304
01:20:27,181 --> 01:20:32,100
it assumes that what you want is within 
the bounds of appropriate reason,

1305
01:20:32,101 --> 01:20:35,190
let's say,
but you could also dream big and there's

1306
01:20:35,191 --> 01:20:37,170
always the possibility that'll work out 
too,

1307
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:42,720
so people as answer those questions,
then they write for 15 minutes,

1308
01:20:42,721 --> 01:20:47,721
okay,
your life is the way you want it to be 

1309
01:20:47,721 --> 01:20:47,721
in four years.
What does it look like?

1310
01:20:49,020 --> 01:20:50,340
Right?
As much as you can,

1311
01:20:50,341 --> 01:20:53,490
don't worry about being too accurate.
Don't worry about grammar or spelling.

1312
01:20:53,580 --> 01:20:55,770
Don't worry about getting it right 
because you're not going to get it right

1313
01:20:55,771 --> 01:20:58,050
anyways.
Just sketch the damn thing out.

1314
01:20:58,350 --> 01:21:00,300
If you could have what you wanted,
what would it be,

1315
01:21:00,450 --> 01:21:02,280
and then we have them do the opposite,
which is,

1316
01:21:02,281 --> 01:21:04,860
all right,
take stock of yourself for a minute with

1317
01:21:04,861 --> 01:21:09,861
all your weaknesses and inadequacies and
bitterness and resentments and sinful 

1318
01:21:09,861 --> 01:21:10,950
tendencies.
Let's say.

1319
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:16,160
Now,
imagine that you let all of that goal 

1320
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:19,700
and occupy you just wear which little 
corner of Hell would you occupy in three

1321
01:21:20,251 --> 01:21:25,251
to five years?
Why don't you write about that and 

1322
01:21:25,251 --> 01:21:28,011
everyone knows where they go.
If they let themselves and so then you 

1323
01:21:28,011 --> 01:21:32,091
have something to avoid and you have 
something to strive for and that makes 

1324
01:21:32,641 --> 01:21:36,690
you optimally motivated because maybe 
you're afraid,

1325
01:21:36,691 --> 01:21:38,370
you know,
you find out you don't like your job and

1326
01:21:38,371 --> 01:21:41,010
you're afraid to change your job and 
then you think,

1327
01:21:41,670 --> 01:21:42,090
oh,
well,

1328
01:21:42,091 --> 01:21:47,091
if I don't change my job,
then I'm heading for this little corner 

1329
01:21:47,091 --> 01:21:47,091
of Hell that I outlined.

1330
01:21:47,091 --> 01:21:47,091
Think,
well,

1331
01:21:47,091 --> 01:21:51,771
that's not a very good plan.
It's very threatening and stressful to 

1332
01:21:51,771 --> 01:21:55,521
change my job,
but it beats the hell out of ending up 

1333
01:21:55,521 --> 01:21:57,831
there.
And so then you have your anxieties 

1334
01:21:57,831 --> 01:21:57,831
behind you pushing your forward instead 
of in front of you,

1335
01:21:57,831 --> 01:22:00,990
stopping you cold.
And then we asked people to write a plan

1336
01:22:01,170 --> 01:22:05,700
to implement their paws division,
to justify it,

1337
01:22:05,701 --> 01:22:10,701
to come up with a strategy for,
for making it into a real world 

1338
01:22:10,701 --> 01:22:14,961
realization.
And we tested that on thousands of 

1339
01:22:14,961 --> 01:22:18,260
university students now and the upshot 
was that it decreased the probability 

1340
01:22:18,260 --> 01:22:20,490
that they would drop out of university 
by 30 percent.

1341
01:22:20,910 --> 01:22:25,910
In fact,
in Canada we did it for 90 minutes 

1342
01:22:25,910 --> 01:22:29,330
before kids went to college in the fall.
They came to their summer orientation,

1343
01:22:30,180 --> 01:22:33,990
neither road for 90 minutes about 
something that required writing,

1344
01:22:33,991 --> 01:22:38,991
but it wasn't so relevant or they wrote 
out a plan and it dropped the dropout 

1345
01:22:39,001 --> 01:22:44,001
rate among young men 50 percent in the 
first semester and it had the biggest 

1346
01:22:44,001 --> 01:22:48,501
effect on young men who didn't do that 
well in high school and who weren't 

1347
01:22:48,501 --> 01:22:51,651
oriented towards a professional career.
The consequence of that was that the 

1348
01:22:51,651 --> 01:22:53,310
university used it for one year and then
stop doing it.

1349
01:22:53,850 --> 01:22:55,860
So which was not surprising in the 
least,

1350
01:22:56,310 --> 01:23:01,310
but the reason that I'm laying out this 
long story for you is because that's 

1351
01:23:01,681 --> 01:23:03,330
what people need.
They need.

1352
01:23:03,690 --> 01:23:06,790
They need a differentiated and 
delineated purpose.

1353
01:23:07,330 --> 01:23:09,070
It's way more important than the money.

1354
01:23:10,590 --> 01:23:13,650
It isn't money that you need.
I know you need money for God's sake.

1355
01:23:13,651 --> 01:23:15,420
I'm not ignorant.
Everybody needs money.

1356
01:23:15,421 --> 01:23:20,421
That's not the point here.
It's the provision of money without 

1357
01:23:20,421 --> 01:23:24,171
purpose is not helpful and what people 
need is a purpose and they need that to 

1358
01:23:24,271 --> 01:23:29,271
develop that for themselves,
obviously because it's something you 

1359
01:23:29,271 --> 01:23:31,761
have to participate in,
but it's something that society has to 

1360
01:23:31,761 --> 01:23:33,270
foster and the reason they need that 
purposes because that's what gives their

1361
01:23:33,271 --> 01:23:35,310
life meaning think,
well,

1362
01:23:35,311 --> 01:23:40,311
think about this.
Do you really think that you would be 

1363
01:23:40,311 --> 01:23:41,220
satisfied if you had money without 
responsibility?

1364
01:23:42,660 --> 01:23:43,260
So what?
Okay,

1365
01:23:43,261 --> 01:23:46,290
got no responsibility because that's 
what everyone wants.

1366
01:23:46,291 --> 01:23:51,291
It's like I had a client,
he wanted to retire when he was kind of 

1367
01:23:51,291 --> 01:23:51,660
young and he and I said,
well,

1368
01:23:51,661 --> 01:23:53,100
what's your retirement dream?
He said,

1369
01:23:53,101 --> 01:23:58,101
well,
I envisioned myself on a beach in a 

1370
01:23:58,101 --> 01:23:58,101
tropical island with a Margarita in my 
hand.

1371
01:23:58,110 --> 01:23:58,830
And I thought,

1372
01:24:01,450 --> 01:24:03,970
what the hell is that?
It's like,

1373
01:24:03,971 --> 01:24:05,230
okay,
let's play that out.

1374
01:24:05,231 --> 01:24:06,640
Let's be adult about this.
Okay,

1375
01:24:06,641 --> 01:24:09,820
so you go down to your this red headed 
white guy,

1376
01:24:09,970 --> 01:24:14,970
you go down to the Caribbean and you sit
on a beach and you're sitting on the 

1377
01:24:14,970 --> 01:24:17,740
beach and you have like six Margarita 
and you're there for like three hours.

1378
01:24:17,950 --> 01:24:19,900
What happens the next day?
Okay,

1379
01:24:19,960 --> 01:24:22,240
your Sun burnt to a crisp,
right?

1380
01:24:22,300 --> 01:24:25,330
So you can't even go out of your hotel 
room and you're hung over.

1381
01:24:25,930 --> 01:24:27,700
Okay,
and let's say now you hide in your hotel

1382
01:24:27,701 --> 01:24:32,701
room for three or four days and you 
recover and then you repeat that every 

1383
01:24:32,701 --> 01:24:36,420
day for three months.
It's like you go outside and all the 

1384
01:24:36,420 --> 01:24:39,421
locals get away from you because you're 
the new drunk lecture who's come down 

1385
01:24:40,181 --> 01:24:42,910
from the north and that's your vision 
for retirement.

1386
01:24:43,370 --> 01:24:44,050
It's like,
okay,

1387
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:46,720
so you have all the money.
You want no responsibility.

1388
01:24:46,721 --> 01:24:49,450
You don't take care of yourself.
You don't have a partner,

1389
01:24:49,451 --> 01:24:51,700
so you don't have to take care of them.
You don't have any kids.

1390
01:24:52,030 --> 01:24:54,740
You don't have to take care of them.
You don't have a job like,

1391
01:24:54,970 --> 01:24:57,400
what are you going to do?
What are you going to do?

1392
01:24:57,401 --> 01:24:59,910
Exactly.
Sit in the sun and Drink Margaritas.

1393
01:25:00,250 --> 01:25:01,390
It's like there's no.

1394
01:25:03,250 --> 01:25:05,680
No,
that's not a good vision.

1395
01:25:06,550 --> 01:25:10,210
You don't want no responsibility.
It's wrong.

1396
01:25:10,570 --> 01:25:15,570
People find the meaning in their life by
adopting responsibility and so provision

1397
01:25:16,871 --> 01:25:18,610
of money.
You know,

1398
01:25:18,611 --> 01:25:20,680
they say,
man does not live by bread alone,

1399
01:25:22,210 --> 01:25:27,210
and there's wisdom in that.
It's like you don't want no 

1400
01:25:27,210 --> 01:25:30,181
responsibility.
You might dream about that if you're 

1401
01:25:30,181 --> 01:25:30,181
crushed by your job,
but then you have the wrong job,

1402
01:25:30,181 --> 01:25:35,071
or do you have the wrong attitude or you
have the wrong job and the wrong 

1403
01:25:35,071 --> 01:25:35,071
attitude.
I don't know what it is.

1404
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:39,640
You want lots of responsibility and 
society needs to foster that and we need

1405
01:25:39,641 --> 01:25:44,530
to help people find their purpose and 
their place and that's,

1406
01:25:44,890 --> 01:25:48,070
that's more to the point than universal 
income.

1407
01:25:48,730 --> 01:25:49,960
It's the wrong solution.

1408
01:25:52,240 --> 01:25:57,240
Thank you.

1409
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:02,420
So that is the solution for the 
individual,

1410
01:26:02,421 --> 01:26:07,421
but for an individual that takes your 
program and authors,

1411
01:26:08,980 --> 01:26:13,980
his or her future already has taken the 
first steps of response,

1412
01:26:14,300 --> 01:26:16,940
personal responsibility by doing 
something about it.

1413
01:26:17,300 --> 01:26:22,300
So let's assume that we hear we,
we assume responsibility for our lives.

1414
01:26:22,431 --> 01:26:26,200
We get our act together and we start 
with our rooms and we,

1415
01:26:26,201 --> 01:26:31,201
we,
we broaden the circle and we want to 

1416
01:26:31,201 --> 01:26:33,611
start helping people out in the world 
that don't have this first seat of 

1417
01:26:34,521 --> 01:26:39,521
responsibility.
And of course some of them will also 

1418
01:26:39,521 --> 01:26:41,270
have diseases that they can't do 
anything about.

1419
01:26:41,690 --> 01:26:46,690
We can leave that aside for now,
but what do we do to inspire others?

1420
01:26:48,990 --> 01:26:50,370
Well,
you just laid it out.

1421
01:26:51,090 --> 01:26:54,830
I would say it's like you know,
one of the things that you.

1422
01:26:55,260 --> 01:27:00,260
You pull out of the clinical literature.
Imagine that you have children who have 

1423
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:06,920
a certain low level amount of 
neurological trouble when they're 

1424
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:07,980
infants,
so something's gone wrong.

1425
01:27:07,980 --> 01:27:11,040
Maybe a little oxygen deprivation at 
birth or something like that.

1426
01:27:11,041 --> 01:27:13,620
Something's gone a little bit wrong with
their neurological development.

1427
01:27:15,180 --> 01:27:17,580
Assuming that the damage isn't too 
severe,

1428
01:27:19,080 --> 01:27:24,080
those children will stabilize and 
normalize if they have at least one well

1429
01:27:25,501 --> 01:27:30,501
put together role model in their life.
And so one of the things that you do if 

1430
01:27:32,491 --> 01:27:37,491
you want to inspire others,
is get your act together because you 

1431
01:27:37,621 --> 01:27:42,621
inspire most through example.
It's more much more powerful than the 

1432
01:27:42,900 --> 01:27:47,900
words.
Words are very powerful if they're also 

1433
01:27:47,900 --> 01:27:50,541
accompanied by example,
but the best thing you can do is start 

1434
01:27:50,541 --> 01:27:55,460
putting things together around you.
There's plenty of things to put 

1435
01:27:55,460 --> 01:27:55,950
together.
It's a good meditative exercise.

1436
01:27:55,951 --> 01:27:56,580
You know,
if you're,

1437
01:27:57,540 --> 01:27:59,820
and I think this is the proper form of 
prayer,

1438
01:27:59,821 --> 01:28:02,100
let's say assuming that there is such a 
thing,

1439
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:07,110
a proper form of prayer would be if 
you're not happy with your life,

1440
01:28:07,260 --> 01:28:12,260
if you're miserable,
you sit on the edge of your bed and you 

1441
01:28:12,260 --> 01:28:12,260
think,

1442
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:18,800
is there anything I can change in what 
I'm doing that is going to make this 

1443
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:20,010
less awful than it has to be less awful 
than it might be.

1444
01:28:20,940 --> 01:28:25,940
You have to ask that.
You know with intent and generally 

1445
01:28:25,940 --> 01:28:29,850
speaking,
you'll get an answer almost immediately.

1446
01:28:31,110 --> 01:28:36,110
There's something that you could put 
right that day that would make things 

1447
01:28:36,110 --> 01:28:38,430
slightly better than they are,
and that's rule four,

1448
01:28:38,431 --> 01:28:43,431
which is compare yourself to who you 
were yet to who you were yesterday and 

1449
01:28:43,431 --> 01:28:47,571
not who someone else's today.
There I don't believe that there is a 

1450
01:28:47,571 --> 01:28:52,221
person who exists who wouldn't receive 
an answer to that question if they 

1451
01:28:52,221 --> 01:28:56,301
genuinely asked it and it's no different
really than thinking like if you think 

1452
01:28:56,301 --> 01:28:58,860
you have a problem,
you think you get an answer might not be

1453
01:28:58,861 --> 01:29:03,861
the right answer,
but obviously you get an and you might 

1454
01:29:03,861 --> 01:29:03,861
think,
well,

1455
01:29:03,861 --> 01:29:03,861
I thought up that answer.
It's like,

1456
01:29:03,861 --> 01:29:05,220
well,
that's really not much of an explanation

1457
01:29:05,221 --> 01:29:08,700
because you don't know how you think.
It's like I'm sitting there and thoughts

1458
01:29:08,701 --> 01:29:10,420
appear in my head and that's how I 
think.

1459
01:29:10,920 --> 01:29:15,030
That's a pretty shallow explanation.
It's not much different than revelation.

1460
01:29:15,390 --> 01:29:17,370
It's like you ask yourself the proper 
questions.

1461
01:29:17,371 --> 01:29:22,371
You'll get the proper answers if you ask
the right question and you want the 

1462
01:29:22,371 --> 01:29:27,171
answers right and those are not easy 
preconditions to set up because who 

1463
01:29:27,301 --> 01:29:28,260
knows?
You know if,

1464
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:30,300
if you're sitting on the edge of your 
bed thinking,

1465
01:29:31,690 --> 01:29:32,260
okay,

1466
01:29:34,060 --> 01:29:39,060
what am I doing wrong?
That's a hell of a question to ask 

1467
01:29:39,060 --> 01:29:41,650
because if you really want to know,
you'll find out and then you'll find out

1468
01:29:41,651 --> 01:29:45,100
that you really didn't want to know 
because generally speaking,

1469
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:50,280
finding out what you're doing wrong is 
not a pleasant experience and it means 

1470
01:29:50,280 --> 01:29:51,460
that you have to sacrifice part of 
yourself,

1471
01:29:51,610 --> 01:29:54,220
usually a burned out,
stupid,

1472
01:29:54,280 --> 01:29:55,570
bitter,
corrupt,

1473
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:57,010
arrogant,
nasty,

1474
01:29:57,790 --> 01:30:02,790
vengeful part of yourself,
but nonetheless part that you like and 

1475
01:30:02,790 --> 01:30:02,790
so

1476
01:30:05,240 --> 01:30:10,240
so you can.
I think that room for those incremental 

1477
01:30:10,240 --> 01:30:13,571
improvements exists within everyone's 
grasp and and I think that it's a humble

1478
01:30:15,561 --> 01:30:20,561
thing to do,
to ask how you could improve 

1479
01:30:20,561 --> 01:30:21,920
incrementally without interfering with 
anyone else.

1480
01:30:21,921 --> 01:30:23,630
Like it's your problem,
not theirs,

1481
01:30:24,140 --> 01:30:29,140
but I think that the consequences of 
maintained incremental improvement are 

1482
01:30:29,811 --> 01:30:34,811
anything but incremental.
You get compound interest on incremental

1483
01:30:34,821 --> 01:30:36,440
improvement.
No.

1484
01:30:36,500 --> 01:30:39,530
There's another rule in the New 
Testament called the matthew principal.

1485
01:30:39,830 --> 01:30:44,830
Economists use it and the rule is to 
those who have everything more will be 

1486
01:30:44,830 --> 01:30:48,791
given and from those who have nothing,
everything will be taken to actually a 

1487
01:30:48,791 --> 01:30:50,510
description of the way the world works.
Interestingly enough,

1488
01:30:50,690 --> 01:30:52,550
you know that if you've ever played 
monopoly,

1489
01:30:52,700 --> 01:30:57,700
because that's what happens if you play 
monopoly and and there's a reason for 

1490
01:30:57,700 --> 01:30:57,700
that,
that's a deep reason,

1491
01:30:58,160 --> 01:31:03,160
but what,
and it's a very harsh rule because it 

1492
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:04,220
means as you start to wander off the 
path,

1493
01:31:04,370 --> 01:31:09,370
let's say the probability that you will 
wander further off the path increases 

1494
01:31:09,370 --> 01:31:14,051
nonlinearly and that's a terrible thing 
to know as you wander towards the edge,

1495
01:31:14,901 --> 01:31:19,901
the probability that you'll fall off the
cliff increases and that's a statistical

1496
01:31:20,451 --> 01:31:25,451
justification for the concept of hell,
but as you improve the probability that 

1497
01:31:27,291 --> 01:31:30,260
each improvement will produce a further 
improvement increases,

1498
01:31:30,740 --> 01:31:35,740
and so perhaps the the downside is the 
cataclysmic catastrophe that you can 

1499
01:31:36,681 --> 01:31:40,460
engage upon if you reproduce your moral 
failings,

1500
01:31:40,461 --> 01:31:45,461
but the upside is that each improvement 
produces an increment in the probability

1501
01:31:45,471 --> 01:31:46,550
of the next improvement.

1502
01:31:46,790 --> 01:31:50,630
And I've seen that it's a truism among 
behavioral psychologists.

1503
01:31:50,631 --> 01:31:55,631
I mean,
although they don't generally phrase it 

1504
01:31:55,631 --> 01:31:57,551
that way.
If you're a behavioral psychologist and 

1505
01:31:57,551 --> 01:32:00,251
I am a behavioral psychologist,
what you do is you find out what 

1506
01:32:00,550 --> 01:32:03,160
essentially you help a person establish 
their aim.

1507
01:32:03,650 --> 01:32:08,650
Then you break down what they're trying 
to do into attainable units and you 

1508
01:32:08,650 --> 01:32:09,580
negotiate with them.
You say,

1509
01:32:09,581 --> 01:32:11,700
well look,
while I'm not,

1510
01:32:11,970 --> 01:32:13,960
they say I'm not making use of my time 
very well.

1511
01:32:13,961 --> 01:32:17,290
Spending three hours a day playing video
games and you say,

1512
01:32:18,070 --> 01:32:18,460
wow,

1513
01:32:19,590 --> 01:32:20,160
okay.

1514
01:32:21,050 --> 01:32:26,050
Hypothetically,
how much time would you like to spend 

1515
01:32:26,050 --> 01:32:26,050
playing video games?
And they say,

1516
01:32:26,050 --> 01:32:30,341
well,
I could probably spend an hour a day 

1517
01:32:30,341 --> 01:32:31,010
without it interfering with the rest of 
my life,

1518
01:32:31,190 --> 01:32:32,420
which is kind of the issue,
right?

1519
01:32:32,421 --> 01:32:34,250
Because if you play video games,
fine,

1520
01:32:34,251 --> 01:32:37,730
but maybe three hours means that you're 
not doing your homework or something and

1521
01:32:37,910 --> 01:32:39,890
that's not a good game.
So you say,

1522
01:32:39,891 --> 01:32:41,750
okay,
well I want to play for an hour a day.

1523
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:42,620
It's like,
okay,

1524
01:32:42,621 --> 01:32:44,840
well can you shift to an hour a day 
right now?

1525
01:32:45,200 --> 01:32:47,090
And this is supposed to be an honest 
conversation,

1526
01:32:47,240 --> 01:32:48,710
and the person says,
no.

1527
01:32:48,711 --> 01:32:51,920
I've tried that lots of times.
Every time I try I just fail.

1528
01:32:52,550 --> 01:32:53,480
And so you don't say,
well,

1529
01:32:53,481 --> 01:32:58,481
quit failing.
Go play one hour a day and the problem 

1530
01:32:58,481 --> 01:33:00,080
will be solved.
That's a stupid strategy.

1531
01:33:00,290 --> 01:33:00,920
You say,
okay,

1532
01:33:00,921 --> 01:33:05,921
well look,
you think about this and don't agree to 

1533
01:33:05,921 --> 01:33:09,821
do this unless you think you will do it,
because otherwise it's just a waste of 

1534
01:33:09,821 --> 01:33:09,821
both of our times.
It's like,

1535
01:33:09,821 --> 01:33:14,440
do you think that you could track how 
much time you spend playing video games 

1536
01:33:14,440 --> 01:33:15,920
for one week?
Don't change anything,

1537
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:17,690
just track it.

1538
01:33:18,710 --> 01:33:19,230
They think,

1539
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:21,690
yeah,
I could probably do that,

1540
01:33:21,691 --> 01:33:23,460
but I might miss a couple of days and 
you think,

1541
01:33:23,461 --> 01:33:24,090
okay,
fine,

1542
01:33:24,240 --> 01:33:27,300
so here's the deal.
Five out of the next seven days,

1543
01:33:27,301 --> 01:33:30,450
you just track how much time you spend 
playing video games and the person says,

1544
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:35,480
I think I can do that,
because that's what you want them to 

1545
01:33:35,480 --> 01:33:35,480
say.
You want them to succeed at.

1546
01:33:35,480 --> 01:33:37,380
The improvement is not much of an 
improvement,

1547
01:33:37,381 --> 01:33:38,490
but it's something,
right?

1548
01:33:38,700 --> 01:33:40,140
Then they come back and they say,
well,

1549
01:33:40,200 --> 01:33:42,180
yeah,
I was playing about four hours a day,

1550
01:33:42,990 --> 01:33:43,950
and so you say,
okay,

1551
01:33:43,951 --> 01:33:45,960
well fine,
good work man.

1552
01:33:45,961 --> 01:33:47,580
You got track.
Now we know what.

1553
01:33:47,730 --> 01:33:52,730
We know the parameters of your problem.
It's actually a little worse than you 

1554
01:33:52,730 --> 01:33:56,031
thought,
but at least he had enough sense to 

1555
01:33:56,031 --> 01:33:56,460
measure it.
We know where you're at.

1556
01:33:56,910 --> 01:34:01,910
Okay.
Do you think you could cut that down to 

1557
01:34:01,910 --> 01:34:02,370
three and a half hours every day

1558
01:34:03,180 --> 01:34:04,020
and the person thinks,

1559
01:34:06,450 --> 01:34:07,800
no,
I'm pretty weak willed.

1560
01:34:07,801 --> 01:34:10,800
I don't think I could manage that.
You say,

1561
01:34:10,801 --> 01:34:11,550
well,
how about this?

1562
01:34:11,551 --> 01:34:14,880
Do you think that to have the next seven
days,

1563
01:34:14,881 --> 01:34:19,881
you can only play for three hours.
You think you can manage that and you 

1564
01:34:19,881 --> 01:34:19,881
don't.
You're not cynical about this.

1565
01:34:19,881 --> 01:34:22,110
You're not insulting the person,
any of that.

1566
01:34:22,111 --> 01:34:27,111
It's like because you don't care.
All you care is that they make some 

1567
01:34:27,111 --> 01:34:29,880
incremental movement towards their goal 
and the person thinks about that.

1568
01:34:29,881 --> 01:34:34,881
If they have any sense and they take 
their weakness into account and they 

1569
01:34:34,881 --> 01:34:35,790
think,
I think I could probably do that,

1570
01:34:36,060 --> 01:34:38,460
and then they come back the next week 
and they say,

1571
01:34:39,060 --> 01:34:44,060
I managed to spend three hours a day 
playing video games for three days and 

1572
01:34:45,131 --> 01:34:46,780
the rest were four hours,
and you say,

1573
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:48,070
good work,
man.

1574
01:34:48,280 --> 01:34:51,640
You've just got rid of 25 percent,

1575
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:58,440
12 and a half percent of your problem,
your one eighth of the way to fixing it 

1576
01:34:59,030 --> 01:35:03,080
in one week and you know the person 
isn't going to be all that thrilled with

1577
01:35:03,081 --> 01:35:08,081
themselves because they don't do the 
arithmetic and they don't do the 

1578
01:35:08,081 --> 01:35:08,081
projection.
They think,

1579
01:35:08,081 --> 01:35:08,780
well,
I'm still pretty damn useless.

1580
01:35:08,781 --> 01:35:12,890
I'm playing 25 hours worth of video 
games a week.

1581
01:35:13,010 --> 01:35:15,050
It's nothing to pat myself on the back 
for.

1582
01:35:15,051 --> 01:35:16,220
It's like,
yes it is.

1583
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:21,380
It's definitely,
it's a market measurable improvement and

1584
01:35:21,381 --> 01:35:23,420
it's a move in the right direction,
you know,

1585
01:35:23,421 --> 01:35:24,260
and then you say,
okay,

1586
01:35:24,261 --> 01:35:29,261
well on the days you succeeded,
how did you manage to succeed and is 

1587
01:35:29,271 --> 01:35:32,870
there a way that you could do it for 
four days next week?

1588
01:35:32,871 --> 01:35:36,380
How about that?
Or maybe you could even try five days.

1589
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:39,530
You think you could do that,
and then you also tell the person,

1590
01:35:39,531 --> 01:35:41,330
look,
the other thing you got to understand is

1591
01:35:41,331 --> 01:35:42,980
you're not going to improve like this.

1592
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:48,880
You're going to improve like this.
So some weeks you're going to come back 

1593
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:48,880
and say,
Geez,

1594
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:51,860
I backslidden completely and I played 
for four hours a day for seven days,

1595
01:35:52,070 --> 01:35:54,800
but doesn't matter because that doesn't 
mean you failed.

1596
01:35:54,801 --> 01:35:59,090
It just means that you slid back,
you want to calculate it over a month or

1597
01:35:59,091 --> 01:36:00,560
something like that.
And you know,

1598
01:36:00,561 --> 01:36:02,420
generally speaking,
a month later,

1599
01:36:02,421 --> 01:36:07,421
the person's down to something like two 
hours a day and you've figured out ways 

1600
01:36:07,581 --> 01:36:10,400
of filling their time in with something 
productive otherwise and,

1601
01:36:10,610 --> 01:36:15,610
and they're on their way.
And the general consequence of that is 

1602
01:36:15,610 --> 01:36:17,300
that every time they manage an 
accomplishment,

1603
01:36:17,690 --> 01:36:19,460
they get a little stronger and 
character.

1604
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:24,600
They get a little bit more confident in 
their ability to get a little bit less 

1605
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:26,630
wracked with self disgust.
They get a little bit more hopeful about

1606
01:36:26,631 --> 01:36:30,650
the future and they get more confident 
that they can make another change.

1607
01:36:31,010 --> 01:36:34,250
And if you're patient and you have to be
patient with yourself that way,

1608
01:36:34,460 --> 01:36:39,460
it's like you reward those incremental 
improvements and you don't get all 

1609
01:36:39,460 --> 01:36:39,890
cynical about them and you think,
okay,

1610
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:43,730
just imagine what would happen if you 
kept doing that every week for 10 years.

1611
01:36:44,510 --> 01:36:48,020
And the answer to that is things would 
be so much better for you that you can't

1612
01:36:48,021 --> 01:36:53,021
even imagine it without much improvement
or maybe even with half that much 

1613
01:36:53,021 --> 01:36:54,140
improvement.
And so that's a,

1614
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:59,280
that's a very good way of progressing.
So very good.

1615
01:37:00,720 --> 01:37:05,720
So yeah,
there's a question here on the article 

1616
01:37:07,591 --> 01:37:12,591
written by your friend Bernard Schiff.
That's one of the many headpieces.

1617
01:37:13,500 --> 01:37:18,330
So yeah,
from via that healthy.

1618
01:37:18,900 --> 01:37:23,900
I want to ask you what your thoughts are
of the article written by Bernard 

1619
01:37:23,900 --> 01:37:24,900
Schiff.
Kind of a wide question,

1620
01:37:24,901 --> 01:37:27,130
but I'd like to hear your side of the 
Mat.

1621
01:37:29,010 --> 01:37:32,400
Okay.
So Bernie Schiff is a friend of mine,

1622
01:37:33,270 --> 01:37:36,860
although he doesn't see it that way.
Well,

1623
01:37:36,870 --> 01:37:41,870
I'm not saying that to be funny.
Like that's how I look at it and it's a 

1624
01:37:41,870 --> 01:37:42,930
loss to me because he was a good friend 
of mine.

1625
01:37:43,140 --> 01:37:48,140
I've lost a couple of friends in the 
last two years and it's two or three 

1626
01:37:48,140 --> 01:37:51,351
years and it's not pleasant,
but he had his reasons for doing what he

1627
01:37:52,021 --> 01:37:53,340
did,
which I won't go into,

1628
01:37:58,250 --> 01:38:00,800
but there is one thing I will say about 
it.

1629
01:38:02,420 --> 01:38:07,420
He set forward a set of propositions 
about the way that I was interacting 

1630
01:38:07,941 --> 01:38:12,941
with my students and am interacting with
all the people like you to whom I'm 

1631
01:38:13,191 --> 01:38:18,191
lecturing and he's he questions my 
motivations and fair enough,

1632
01:38:20,950 --> 01:38:21,490
but

1633
01:38:23,300 --> 01:38:24,550
he said,
for example,

1634
01:38:24,950 --> 01:38:26,930
I'm paraphrasing,
but this is the gist of it,

1635
01:38:27,320 --> 01:38:30,440
that my style was autocratic say in the 
classroom,

1636
01:38:31,490 --> 01:38:36,490
and he cited a couple of students who 
felt that way and I would say,

1637
01:38:37,610 --> 01:38:38,990
I'll say two things about that.

1638
01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:43,420
The the

1639
01:38:43,890 --> 01:38:48,180
evaluations of my classes at Harvard and
at the University of Toronto.

1640
01:38:49,110 --> 01:38:54,110
We're almost invariably better than the 
evaluations of any classes they'd ever 

1641
01:38:54,110 --> 01:38:58,941
had.
That's the first thing in my maps of 

1642
01:38:58,941 --> 01:38:59,280
meaning class.
The most common comment,

1643
01:38:59,281 --> 01:39:04,281
and that would have been from about 80 
percent of students was that the class 

1644
01:39:04,281 --> 01:39:05,580
completely changed the way they 
conducted their lives.

1645
01:39:06,180 --> 01:39:11,180
So that's issue number one.
Issue number two is all those lectures 

1646
01:39:11,401 --> 01:39:14,250
are online,
like not every lecture I've given in the

1647
01:39:14,251 --> 01:39:17,730
last 30 years is online,
but every lecture I've given in the last

1648
01:39:17,731 --> 01:39:22,731
four years is online plus one lecture 
series that I gave 30 years ago and a 

1649
01:39:22,731 --> 01:39:27,471
whole bunch of other talks.
And so if you want to see whether the 

1650
01:39:27,471 --> 01:39:30,990
accusations leveled at me in that 
argument in that article are true,

1651
01:39:31,470 --> 01:39:34,410
all you have to do is go watch the 
lectures and if you think they're true,

1652
01:39:34,411 --> 01:39:37,710
well then he's right.
And if you don't think they're true then

1653
01:39:37,711 --> 01:39:39,870
he isn't right.
The d,

1654
01:39:39,930 --> 01:39:42,450
The evidence is,
it's not like it's hidden.

1655
01:39:43,110 --> 01:39:45,180
I've been recording my lectures since 
like,

1656
01:39:45,270 --> 01:39:50,100
well I recorded one in 1993 at Harvard 
and so it's online and then there's like

1657
01:39:50,130 --> 01:39:54,390
200 hours of them.
So whatever my crimes,

1658
01:39:55,260 --> 01:39:58,290
they're there for everyone to see and to
determine for themselves.

1659
01:39:58,320 --> 01:40:01,310
And so that's mostly what people are 
doing and um,

1660
01:40:01,980 --> 01:40:03,870
that's fine with me.
So.

1661
01:40:04,140 --> 01:40:06,450
And that's pretty much all I have to say
about that article.

1662
01:40:08,730 --> 01:40:13,730
Thank you.

1663
01:40:16,170 --> 01:40:21,170
There's a question from a Mcdonald's,
a relating to what you discussed 

1664
01:40:22,231 --> 01:40:24,000
earlier,
nuclear weapons.

1665
01:40:24,030 --> 01:40:27,540
What are your thoughts on mutually 
assured destruction?

1666
01:40:28,440 --> 01:40:31,890
Will we be safer in a world without 
nuclear weapons?

1667
01:40:35,550 --> 01:40:38,310
I think it depends on how we decide to 
conduct ourselves.

1668
01:40:39,480 --> 01:40:44,480
You know,
it isn't obvious to me that we're in a 

1669
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:45,480
position where we can trust ourselves 
without nuclear weapons.

1670
01:40:46,710 --> 01:40:47,220
You know,

1671
01:40:48,930 --> 01:40:53,930
nuclear weapons are like,
they're like a judgmental God in some 

1672
01:40:53,930 --> 01:40:54,600
sense.
If you miss,

1673
01:40:54,601 --> 01:40:57,130
behave too badly,
there's going to be hell to pay,

1674
01:40:58,030 --> 01:41:01,900
and so the consequence of that,
since the end of the Second World War,

1675
01:41:02,170 --> 01:41:07,170
thank God,
is that no one has misbehaved too badly 

1676
01:41:07,170 --> 01:41:11,440
yet,
and so I don't know if that's.

1677
01:41:12,160 --> 01:41:15,340
We've had comparative piece since the 
end of the Second World War.

1678
01:41:16,630 --> 01:41:21,630
Now that doesn't mean there hasn't been 
caught chronic low level conflict and 

1679
01:41:21,630 --> 01:41:26,401
some of it.
I'm not saying that the conflicts have 

1680
01:41:26,401 --> 01:41:26,401
been trivial,
but compared to world war two,

1681
01:41:26,401 --> 01:41:29,350
they are trivial and certainly compared 
to world war three,

1682
01:41:29,460 --> 01:41:34,460
they are trivial.
And so I would say that the hydrogen 

1683
01:41:34,460 --> 01:41:38,761
bomb has put the fear of God into us and
that there's some utility in that 

1684
01:41:38,761 --> 01:41:42,810
obviously it would be better if we 
didn't need that because they're 

1685
01:41:42,810 --> 01:41:46,711
dangerous and the probability that 
there'll be an accident at some point 

1686
01:41:46,711 --> 01:41:50,110
seems to me to be 100 percent because 
there's always an accident.

1687
01:41:50,170 --> 01:41:53,200
Right?
And so we're playing with fire.

1688
01:41:53,230 --> 01:41:53,590
But,

1689
01:41:56,740 --> 01:42:01,120
but it isn't self evident to me that so 
far it's been a bad thing.

1690
01:42:03,010 --> 01:42:04,720
Even the,
even the Soviets,

1691
01:42:04,721 --> 01:42:07,180
even Stellan,
although he was probably,

1692
01:42:07,390 --> 01:42:12,390
there is some evidence that stelling 
Stellan was gearing up for the Third 

1693
01:42:12,390 --> 01:42:16,800
World War and that he would have been 
willing to put Europe to the 

1694
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:19,531
thermonuclear torch.
And he was just the kind of guy to do 

1695
01:42:19,531 --> 01:42:22,921
it.
He'd been practicing doing that for a 

1696
01:42:22,921 --> 01:42:24,010
long time.
After you kill your 10000000th person,

1697
01:42:24,370 --> 01:42:28,570
the next 10 million come pretty easy.
And so he was.

1698
01:42:28,810 --> 01:42:33,810
There is evidence that he was gearing up
for that in western Europe and that he 

1699
01:42:33,810 --> 01:42:34,930
was probably killed.
And so,

1700
01:42:35,740 --> 01:42:40,740
but apart from stolen,
no one has come along who's been corrupt

1701
01:42:40,970 --> 01:42:44,290
and malevolent enough to make that a 
priority.

1702
01:42:44,620 --> 01:42:49,620
And so that's so far a testament to the 
fundamental goodness of the human heart.

1703
01:42:53,560 --> 01:42:57,340
But what do you think Hitler with have 
done with nuclear weapons?

1704
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,850
I think he probably would have cleared 
out most of eastern Europe

1705
01:43:07,670 --> 01:43:10,970
being part of his plan.
I mean you perhaps know this,

1706
01:43:10,971 --> 01:43:15,770
but Hitler believed the Germans deserved
an empire like many other east,

1707
01:43:15,890 --> 01:43:20,890
many other European countries had an 
empire and he felt that it was no 

1708
01:43:20,890 --> 01:43:24,620
different for the Germans to pursue 
their empire than it was for the British

1709
01:43:24,621 --> 01:43:29,621
and that his empire was going to be in 
eastern Europe because what the hell 

1710
01:43:29,621 --> 01:43:29,621
good are they?
Anyways,

1711
01:43:29,621 --> 01:43:33,620
that was his attitude and I think he 
would have used whatever means necessary

1712
01:43:33,621 --> 01:43:38,621
to clear out as much territory as 
possible so that it could have been 

1713
01:43:38,621 --> 01:43:40,670
inhabited by his voke.
That's what it looks like now.

1714
01:43:40,700 --> 01:43:45,700
You know,
you might ask about credit have been 

1715
01:43:45,700 --> 01:43:47,710
done by nuclear means and the answer 
that's probably so I think he would have

1716
01:43:49,281 --> 01:43:51,350
put them to use.
I mean,

1717
01:43:51,351 --> 01:43:52,940
my sense of Hitler,
you say,

1718
01:43:52,941 --> 01:43:54,090
well,
what motivated Hitler?

1719
01:43:54,140 --> 01:43:54,530
You say,
well,

1720
01:43:54,531 --> 01:43:56,180
he wanted to rule the world.
It's like,

1721
01:43:56,750 --> 01:44:00,830
I don't think that's what he wanted.
I think he got exactly what he wanted.

1722
01:44:01,220 --> 01:44:04,340
He wanted to put a bullet through his 
head when Berlin was in ruins and Europe

1723
01:44:04,341 --> 01:44:05,180
was inflamed.

1724
01:44:06,920 --> 01:44:10,030
That's exactly what he did.
And you think,

1725
01:44:10,031 --> 01:44:11,170
well,
no one could aim for that.

1726
01:44:11,171 --> 01:44:13,720
It's like,
think again,

1727
01:44:14,440 --> 01:44:17,260
someone named for it and they got it 
too.

1728
01:44:18,310 --> 01:44:22,120
So I don't think he would've stopped.
So,

1729
01:44:24,510 --> 01:44:29,510
um,
there's a question here regarding the 

1730
01:44:29,510 --> 01:44:34,260
controversial statement three regarding 
enforced monogamy.

1731
01:44:38,890 --> 01:44:43,890
So from DC,
three question stating the obvious often

1732
01:44:45,761 --> 01:44:50,761
suggests an agenda.
I agree with your observation that lack 

1733
01:44:51,221 --> 01:44:54,520
of sex for young men can make society 
more violent.

1734
01:44:55,300 --> 01:44:59,200
What should be done?
That's actually not my observation.

1735
01:45:00,790 --> 01:45:04,500
So that isn't my observation.
Amen.

1736
01:45:04,501 --> 01:45:09,501
In words matter,
my observation is that social norms 

1737
01:45:09,501 --> 01:45:12,250
favoring monogamy are essentially a 
human universal.

1738
01:45:13,300 --> 01:45:18,300
And the reason for that is that we've 
learned through painful experience that 

1739
01:45:18,910 --> 01:45:23,910
social conventions,
favoring monogamy are the best way to 

1740
01:45:25,090 --> 01:45:30,090
reduce male violence,
provide a secure environment for 

1741
01:45:30,101 --> 01:45:35,101
children,
and help women find partners to help 

1742
01:45:35,101 --> 01:45:37,090
them with the difficult process of 
reproduction and child rearing.

1743
01:45:38,380 --> 01:45:43,380
And that's the.
The woman who wrote that article knew 

1744
01:45:43,720 --> 01:45:48,520
perfectly well that when I used the term
enforced monogamy,

1745
01:45:48,610 --> 01:45:53,610
and we only discussed this for probably 
two minutes out of an interview that 

1746
01:45:53,610 --> 01:45:57,001
lasted two days.
She knew perfectly well that I meant 

1747
01:45:57,460 --> 01:46:02,460
social convention,
but it was in her interest to find a 

1748
01:46:04,691 --> 01:46:09,691
phrase that could be misinterpreted so 
that what I was speaking about could be 

1749
01:46:10,721 --> 01:46:15,250
misinterpreted.
So here's what enforced monogamy means.

1750
01:46:16,990 --> 01:46:21,370
So let's say my son is planning to get 
married in the fall.

1751
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:24,490
And all right,
I'm happy about his fiance.

1752
01:46:24,491 --> 01:46:27,970
We seem to get along quite well.
They seem to do quite well together.

1753
01:46:28,390 --> 01:46:33,390
And so I'm pleased that they've made the
decision to start their life together.

1754
01:46:35,170 --> 01:46:39,880
So now imagine that he comes to me any 
here and he says,

1755
01:46:42,040 --> 01:46:43,600
I've got some news for you,
dad.

1756
01:46:44,780 --> 01:46:49,780
I've been married for a whole year and 
I've managed to have three affairs 

1757
01:46:49,780 --> 01:46:52,170
during that time,
not get caught and what am I supposed to

1758
01:46:52,171 --> 01:46:53,250
do about that?
Hey,

1759
01:46:53,300 --> 01:46:54,900
what do I put my arm around them and 
say,

1760
01:46:54,901 --> 01:46:59,100
good work kid way to be.
It's like no.

1761
01:47:00,360 --> 01:47:01,710
First of all,
if he did that,

1762
01:47:01,711 --> 01:47:05,610
he wouldn't tell me and second,
if he did tell me,

1763
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:10,760
which I can't imagine,
I would ask him just what the hell did 

1764
01:47:10,760 --> 01:47:15,411
he think he was doing that that was no 
way to conduct himself and it would be 

1765
01:47:16,110 --> 01:47:21,030
something I would regard as contemptible
not only the affairs but the deceit that

1766
01:47:21,060 --> 01:47:26,060
goes along with it and the violation of 
his vows and the breaking of the 

1767
01:47:26,060 --> 01:47:29,661
harmonious relationship that he decided 
voluntarily to establish and the 

1768
01:47:29,661 --> 01:47:33,060
weakening of the family structure and 
the trouble that he put everyone through

1769
01:47:33,061 --> 01:47:36,240
to attend the marriage ceremony in good 
faith and all of that.

1770
01:47:37,050 --> 01:47:40,320
While it's that's enforced monogamy for 
God's sake.

1771
01:47:40,710 --> 01:47:45,710
It's the.
It's the assumption of the 

1772
01:47:45,710 --> 01:47:49,641
responsibility on the part of people who
enter a relationship with some 

1773
01:47:49,801 --> 01:47:54,801
expectation of permanence to uphold the 
promise that they make when they do 

1774
01:47:54,801 --> 01:47:58,971
that,
and she knew that bloody perfectly well 

1775
01:47:58,971 --> 01:47:59,910
and so it's just a,

1776
01:48:01,660 --> 01:48:04,240
it's so idiotic.
It's almost impossible to believe,

1777
01:48:04,710 --> 01:48:06,430
you know,
first of all,

1778
01:48:06,640 --> 01:48:08,440
if you're going to accuse someone of 
something,

1779
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:12,340
you should at least accused them of 
something that's plausible.

1780
01:48:12,760 --> 01:48:17,760
It's like,
would there isn't anybody who goes 

1781
01:48:17,760 --> 01:48:19,600
around thinking that monogamy should be 
enforced at the point of a gun,

1782
01:48:19,990 --> 01:48:22,540
you know,
maybe the odd isis wing nut does that,

1783
01:48:22,541 --> 01:48:24,070
thinks that,
but no,

1784
01:48:24,071 --> 01:48:29,071
there isn't anyone who thinks that is 
including me and she knew that perfectly

1785
01:48:29,351 --> 01:48:34,351
well and so if that's the best that my,
those who regard themselves as my 

1786
01:48:34,691 --> 01:48:39,340
enemies on the left can manage as a 
character slurred then well,

1787
01:48:39,400 --> 01:48:41,830
you know,
have outer boys and girls.

1788
01:48:41,980 --> 01:48:44,650
It's pretty bloody pathetic as far as 
I'm concerned.

1789
01:48:45,210 --> 01:48:45,570
So

1790
01:48:46,670 --> 01:48:51,670
thank you.

1791
01:48:52,020 --> 01:48:54,780
I'll tell you one more thing about that.
Here's something interesting.

1792
01:48:54,781 --> 01:48:56,790
I detailed this out in 12 rules for 
life.

1793
01:48:56,940 --> 01:49:00,000
I don't have the figures exactly right 
because I haven't got to memorize,

1794
01:49:00,001 --> 01:49:05,001
but you know,
over the last 20 years the desire for 

1795
01:49:05,001 --> 01:49:08,430
marriage has increased among young women
and by a substantial margin.

1796
01:49:08,431 --> 01:49:10,740
I think it's 35 percent,
something like that.

1797
01:49:10,950 --> 01:49:15,950
At the same time,
it's decreased among men by about 17 

1798
01:49:15,950 --> 01:49:16,490
percent.
It's like,

1799
01:49:16,491 --> 01:49:18,050
so why am I telling you that?
It's like,

1800
01:49:18,890 --> 01:49:19,430
well,

1801
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:24,840
are we so blind that we don't realize 
what most people want?

1802
01:49:25,880 --> 01:49:30,880
Like most people who aren't cynical 
dream that they'll find a monogamous 

1803
01:49:32,521 --> 01:49:34,170
partner.
You think,

1804
01:49:34,171 --> 01:49:35,550
well,
what's the evidence for that?

1805
01:49:35,580 --> 01:49:36,210
Well,
first of all,

1806
01:49:36,211 --> 01:49:41,211
there's evidence for that because all 
you have to do is ask people and the 

1807
01:49:41,211 --> 01:49:43,050
majority of them tell you that,
but there's way more evidence than that.

1808
01:49:43,051 --> 01:49:44,760
It's like,
what do you do?

1809
01:49:44,820 --> 01:49:49,820
You take your date to a romantic comedy 
and what's the structure of the romantic

1810
01:49:49,931 --> 01:49:54,931
comedy?
Man Lies to partner and has multiple 

1811
01:49:54,931 --> 01:49:58,891
affairs and you go away from that 
romantic comedy and you think that was 

1812
01:49:58,891 --> 01:49:59,890
fun.
Let's do that.

1813
01:50:00,160 --> 01:50:05,160
It's like that isn't.
What happens is you go to a romantic 

1814
01:50:05,160 --> 01:50:08,011
comedy together and you see a couple who
are attracted and repulsed across the 

1815
01:50:08,810 --> 01:50:13,810
across the dynamics of the movie and 
they overcome a bunch of obstacles and 

1816
01:50:13,810 --> 01:50:17,941
they decide to live happily ever after 
and that's the romantic comedy and it's 

1817
01:50:17,941 --> 01:50:22,711
like a sure fire success if it's 
reasonably handled because it reflects 

1818
01:50:22,711 --> 01:50:26,710
what people want and the reason that 
reflects that is because basically,

1819
01:50:27,040 --> 01:50:30,730
although not without exception,
human beings are monogamous,

1820
01:50:30,731 --> 01:50:35,731
we tilt towards monogamy.
That doesn't mean we can't be serially 

1821
01:50:35,731 --> 01:50:39,601
monogamous and it doesn't mean that 
there aren't people who tend towards 

1822
01:50:39,601 --> 01:50:42,250
multiple partners,
but it's not the dream.

1823
01:50:42,670 --> 01:50:45,310
That's for sure.
It's not what we enforce social norms.

1824
01:50:45,311 --> 01:50:50,311
It's not the universal human standard.
It's not what makes for good people,

1825
01:50:50,651 --> 01:50:55,651
individuals or good intimate 
relationships or solid families or 

1826
01:50:55,651 --> 01:50:59,611
stable communities and so and I don't 
know how that can be contentious.

1827
01:51:00,910 --> 01:51:03,880
How did that become contentious?
What's the alternative

1828
01:51:05,110 --> 01:51:05,460
like?

1829
01:51:06,710 --> 01:51:10,580
Responsibility lists,
impulsive sex.

1830
01:51:10,610 --> 01:51:11,960
It's like,
do it,

1831
01:51:11,990 --> 01:51:14,600
man,
do it for 15 years.

1832
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:18,110
See how much fun it is.
See where you end up.

1833
01:51:18,610 --> 01:51:22,460
You will certainly end up cynical.
You'll definitely end up alone.

1834
01:51:22,940 --> 01:51:24,410
Well then what the hell are you going to
do?

1835
01:51:24,740 --> 01:51:27,260
What are you going to do when you're 45 
and you don't have anyone?

1836
01:51:28,070 --> 01:51:29,870
Now,
what are you going to do for the next 35

1837
01:51:29,871 --> 01:51:30,980
years?
You don't have kids.

1838
01:51:31,130 --> 01:51:36,130
You're not going to have grandchildren.
You don't have someone to tangle your 

1839
01:51:36,130 --> 01:51:39,041
story together with.
You don't have anything that lends 

1840
01:51:39,041 --> 01:51:41,561
solidity to your life.
You've got no responsibility and so no 

1841
01:51:41,561 --> 01:51:42,320
self respect.
Oh,

1842
01:51:42,321 --> 01:51:47,321
if that's what you want,
if that's what you're promoting as an 

1843
01:51:47,321 --> 01:51:49,160
alternative to enforce monogamy,
it's like have added to your life.

1844
01:51:49,550 --> 01:51:52,220
You'll see.
That's my sense of it,

1845
01:51:53,270 --> 01:51:53,690
so

1846
01:51:58,190 --> 01:52:00,620
thanks.

1847
01:52:03,150 --> 01:52:04,560
No,
here's a good one.

1848
01:52:04,840 --> 01:52:09,840
What can mark system contribute to our 
modern day world by it can contribute 

1849
01:52:13,561 --> 01:52:15,810
Venezuela and it has,
and it has.

1850
01:52:21,710 --> 01:52:23,790
I'll be a little bit less cynical in our
hands,

1851
01:52:24,180 --> 01:52:29,180
but we've seen what it can contribute.
I don't know how many bloody times we 

1852
01:52:29,180 --> 01:52:30,990
have to run the experiment.
No,

1853
01:52:31,050 --> 01:52:33,660
that wasn't real Marxism.
I know what that means.

1854
01:52:33,870 --> 01:52:36,750
I know what that sentence means.
What that means is,

1855
01:52:37,230 --> 01:52:42,230
well,
if I was the dictator with my profound 

1856
01:52:42,230 --> 01:52:46,971
understanding of Marx's real intent and 
my benevolent compassion uncontaminated 

1857
01:52:48,741 --> 01:52:52,550
by any proclivity towards darkness or 
sin,

1858
01:52:52,760 --> 01:52:57,760
I would bring on the socialist utopia.
That's what it means fundamentally,

1859
01:52:58,850 --> 01:53:03,850
and if someone says that and claims it,
then you should get the hell away from 

1860
01:53:03,850 --> 01:53:06,710
them as fast as you possibly can.
Okay,

1861
01:53:06,711 --> 01:53:11,711
so mark's was concerned about inequality
and there are reasons to be concerned 

1862
01:53:11,711 --> 01:53:15,881
about inequality,
but the problem with Marxism is that it 

1863
01:53:15,881 --> 01:53:19,091
lays the cause of equality at the feet 
of the fundamental institutions of the 

1864
01:53:19,091 --> 01:53:19,091
West.

1865
01:53:19,100 --> 01:53:20,690
The free market,
democracy,

1866
01:53:20,720 --> 01:53:23,150
capitalism,
patriarchy,

1867
01:53:23,270 --> 01:53:28,270
the hated word,
inequality is not caused by the 

1868
01:53:28,270 --> 01:53:30,530
institutions of the West.
That's wrong.

1869
01:53:31,070 --> 01:53:33,740
Inequality is the fundamental rule of 
existence,

1870
01:53:33,890 --> 01:53:36,920
and it's produced.
The thing about the western systems,

1871
01:53:37,190 --> 01:53:41,390
every system we know produces inequality
when it's run as a,

1872
01:53:41,540 --> 01:53:43,490
as a,
as an operative process,

1873
01:53:44,270 --> 01:53:49,270
all of the systems produce inequality.
What we've developed in the West is the 

1874
01:53:49,270 --> 01:53:52,970
only system that produces wealth along 
with the inequality,

1875
01:53:53,480 --> 01:53:54,230
and you might say,
well,

1876
01:53:54,231 --> 01:53:57,950
the wealth isn't equally distributed.
It's like that's true,

1877
01:53:58,100 --> 01:54:01,550
hence the inequality,
but at least there's some wealth.

1878
01:54:02,180 --> 01:54:04,370
You know,
the number of people in absolute poverty

1879
01:54:04,371 --> 01:54:07,580
in the world have to between 2000 and 
2012,

1880
01:54:07,700 --> 01:54:12,350
three years faster than the UN was 
hoping for in its most wildly optimistic

1881
01:54:12,351 --> 01:54:17,351
projections.
People are getting comparatively richer 

1882
01:54:17,351 --> 01:54:18,440
at an absolute level with unbelievable 
speed.

1883
01:54:18,441 --> 01:54:21,920
It's never been seen in the entire 
history of the planet first.

1884
01:54:21,920 --> 01:54:26,920
It happened in the West,
obviously including to Iceland and even 

1885
01:54:26,920 --> 01:54:29,740
in the last 75 years here.
This has been an unbelievable increasing

1886
01:54:29,780 --> 01:54:33,020
the standard of living and now it's 
starting to happen everywhere else.

1887
01:54:33,440 --> 01:54:38,420
This fastest growing economies in the 
world are in Subsaharan Africa.

1888
01:54:39,080 --> 01:54:42,230
That's a hell of a good deal.
There's no starvation in China.

1889
01:54:42,620 --> 01:54:47,620
There's no starvation in India and in 
the places in the world where there's 

1890
01:54:47,620 --> 01:54:51,451
still is starvation.
It's because because of political 

1891
01:54:51,451 --> 01:54:54,551
reasons,
it's not because there isn't enough 

1892
01:54:54,551 --> 01:54:56,051
food.
It's because one group of people sets 

1893
01:54:56,051 --> 01:54:56,480
out to star of another group of people 
to death.

1894
01:54:56,720 --> 01:55:00,500
It's not a matter of absolute privation 
or because of Marxism.

1895
01:55:00,740 --> 01:55:02,600
Well,
yes,

1896
01:55:02,870 --> 01:55:04,330
because of mark says,
right.

1897
01:55:04,460 --> 01:55:08,360
I think the average Venezuelan has lost 
something like 17 pounds,

1898
01:55:08,920 --> 01:55:09,680
you know,
it's very,

1899
01:55:09,681 --> 01:55:11,600
it's awful.
It's absolutely awful.

1900
01:55:12,020 --> 01:55:14,570
So I don't think that Marxism has a damn
thing.

1901
01:55:14,660 --> 01:55:19,660
I think Marxism has already contributed 
enough millions of corpses to have 

1902
01:55:20,300 --> 01:55:23,000
finished with its contributions 
personally,

1903
01:55:23,590 --> 01:55:28,590
but it isn't Marxism thing just because 
it has its appeal and its appeal comes 

1904
01:55:30,291 --> 01:55:35,291
from grains of truth that had uses and 
tries to stretch across an explain,

1905
01:55:35,991 --> 01:55:40,991
allowing the Marxists point to the 
pernicious problem of inequality and 

1906
01:55:41,750 --> 01:55:45,330
inequality is a problem of inequality is
a problem.

1907
01:55:45,780 --> 01:55:50,780
I mean,
I outlined that in part in 12 rules for 

1908
01:55:50,780 --> 01:55:52,941
life.
The reason there's a left wing and the 

1909
01:55:52,941 --> 01:55:53,730
reason there should be a left wing is 
because inequality is a problem.

1910
01:55:53,731 --> 01:55:58,200
It has to be addressed and when you set 
up a hierarchical structure,

1911
01:55:58,320 --> 01:56:03,320
which you need to,
if you're going to pursue things of 

1912
01:56:03,320 --> 01:56:04,500
value,
then the hierarchy tends to ossify and,

1913
01:56:04,680 --> 01:56:05,670
and,
and,

1914
01:56:05,940 --> 01:56:09,990
and become rigid and it becomes hard for
people at the bottom to climb to the top

1915
01:56:09,991 --> 01:56:12,390
and so they get dispossessed and that 
can become permanent.

1916
01:56:12,720 --> 01:56:15,150
That's a bad thing.
It's everyone's problem,

1917
01:56:15,240 --> 01:56:18,060
left wing centrust,
right wing doesn't matter.

1918
01:56:18,240 --> 01:56:23,240
Inequality is a problem,
but that doesn't mean that you can lay 

1919
01:56:23,240 --> 01:56:27,291
it at the feet of the institutions of 
the West and that's where Marxism goes 

1920
01:56:27,291 --> 01:56:32,031
wrong.
And it also doesn't mean that we know 

1921
01:56:32,031 --> 01:56:34,371
how to fix inequality.
It's really a hard problem and so it,

1922
01:56:35,310 --> 01:56:37,290
it's a much harder problem than people 
think.

1923
01:56:38,340 --> 01:56:39,780
Now when we don't know what to do about 
it.

1924
01:56:39,930 --> 01:56:43,050
We've done some things and you know,
our culture is very.

1925
01:56:43,051 --> 01:56:48,051
The Scandinavian countries tend to be a 
little bit more on the income 

1926
01:56:48,051 --> 01:56:49,500
redistribution side and that seems to 
have worked reasonably well.

1927
01:56:49,501 --> 01:56:51,930
I mean the Scandinavian countries are 
pretty damn livable.

1928
01:56:52,140 --> 01:56:57,140
They've got their problems,
particularly Sweden as far as I can 

1929
01:56:57,140 --> 01:56:57,140
tell,
but,

1930
01:56:57,140 --> 01:57:00,860
but,
but it's easier for homogenous small 

1931
01:57:00,860 --> 01:57:01,200
countries to do risk redistribution by 
all appearances.

1932
01:57:01,380 --> 01:57:03,510
It's not so easy for a place like the 
United States,

1933
01:57:03,511 --> 01:57:08,511
which is much bigger and much more 
diverse and has a much broader range of 

1934
01:57:08,511 --> 01:57:11,991
problems.
And so the western countries are 

1935
01:57:11,991 --> 01:57:15,051
stumbling through.
Some of them have steeper hierarchies 

1936
01:57:15,051 --> 01:57:17,090
and less of a social safety net like the
US.

1937
01:57:17,130 --> 01:57:22,130
Although it's incredibly productive and 
tended to have very low levels of 

1938
01:57:22,130 --> 01:57:25,910
unemployment and then there's places 
like the Scandinavian countries where 

1939
01:57:25,910 --> 01:57:29,490
the social and Canada where the social 
safety net is more well developed,

1940
01:57:29,491 --> 01:57:31,310
but that struggle with,
with,

1941
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:36,520
with,
with improving productivity and with 

1942
01:57:36,520 --> 01:57:36,600
higher rates of unemployment most of the
countries.

1943
01:57:36,960 --> 01:57:41,960
So we don't know how to get that right,
but we're kind of muddling through it 

1944
01:57:41,960 --> 01:57:42,060
and at the same time we're muddling 
through it.

1945
01:57:42,420 --> 01:57:47,420
Almost all of us are getting absolutely 
Richard and so that's a pretty good 

1946
01:57:47,420 --> 01:57:52,160
default position to be in when you're 
trying to sort out the inequality 

1947
01:57:52,160 --> 01:57:55,521
problem and you know,
I've been thinking over the last weeks 

1948
01:57:55,521 --> 01:57:56,840
that there are,
you know,

1949
01:57:56,850 --> 01:58:00,840
you can express these problems in quasi 
mathematical form.

1950
01:58:00,840 --> 01:58:05,840
It's like there's probably a rule that's
something like in order to produce one 

1951
01:58:05,840 --> 01:58:10,040
increment of absolute wealth,
you have to allow three increments of 

1952
01:58:10,040 --> 01:58:14,091
inequality or something like that.
Inequality is the price you pay for the 

1953
01:58:14,091 --> 01:58:17,391
generation of wealth.
And I suspect because the right amount 

1954
01:58:17,391 --> 01:58:20,961
of inequality,
the right amount of inequality is not 

1955
01:58:20,961 --> 01:58:21,390
zero.
It's some number.

1956
01:58:21,660 --> 01:58:23,610
And you could debate about what that 
number is,

1957
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,670
but it's not zero.
You flattened everyone out,

1958
01:58:26,700 --> 01:58:31,700
you get nothing if you have a 
meritocracy of some sort than if you're 

1959
01:58:32,310 --> 01:58:35,210
producing something to get to the top,
uh,

1960
01:58:35,230 --> 01:58:37,110
you know,
producing something for others.

1961
01:58:37,500 --> 01:58:39,030
Well,
the thing is,

1962
01:58:39,031 --> 01:58:44,031
is that the radical types believe that 
they don't believe that there's anything

1963
01:58:44,531 --> 01:58:49,531
but power they don't want.
Another thing that really annoys me 

1964
01:58:49,531 --> 01:58:52,561
about the universities and this doctrine
that I've been combating,

1965
01:58:52,811 --> 01:58:53,570
let's say,
is that

1966
01:58:55,840 --> 01:59:00,220
your argument is predicated on,
on the idea that there's such a thing as

1967
01:59:00,221 --> 01:59:05,221
merit,
that there's such a thing as things 

1968
01:59:05,221 --> 01:59:08,371
worth doing.
And the real radical types would debate 

1969
01:59:08,371 --> 01:59:08,371
that.
They just say,

1970
01:59:08,371 --> 01:59:12,601
well,
you're just using the idea of 

1971
01:59:12,601 --> 01:59:14,281
meritocracy to justify your page,
your position in the patriarchal 

1972
01:59:14,281 --> 01:59:14,650
tyranny.
And you might say,

1973
01:59:14,651 --> 01:59:15,460
well no,
I'm not.

1974
01:59:15,461 --> 01:59:20,461
And they would say,
you're just a mouthpiece for your group 

1975
01:59:20,461 --> 01:59:20,740
privilege.
There isn't any.

1976
01:59:20,741 --> 01:59:24,680
You don't make that mistake.
There's no you,

1977
01:59:25,360 --> 01:59:25,840
you're just

1978
01:59:27,050 --> 01:59:30,500
an Avatar for your privilege.
So.

1979
01:59:30,540 --> 01:59:31,220
Well,
thank you.

1980
01:59:32,720 --> 01:59:37,720
Well know.
So before I ask the last question,

1981
01:59:38,930 --> 01:59:43,930
I'd like to remind you that we were 
going to meet outside this room and more

1982
01:59:44,361 --> 01:59:48,050
people may come since the people from 
yesterday,

1983
01:59:48,051 --> 01:59:51,470
they,
they may come as well and Dr Peterson is

1984
01:59:51,471 --> 01:59:54,670
going to sign books and if you're going 
to have books signed,

1985
01:59:54,710 --> 01:59:57,160
you'll have a few seconds with him.
Um,

1986
01:59:57,710 --> 01:59:59,490
so,
um,

1987
02:00:00,230 --> 02:00:02,330
yeah,
the last question,

1988
02:00:02,331 --> 02:00:06,950
we had a similar question yesterday.
A very original one from savannah.

1989
02:00:06,980 --> 02:00:07,800
Thank you.
So honored.

1990
02:00:08,030 --> 02:00:12,880
How do you like Iceland?
Um,

1991
02:00:14,030 --> 02:00:19,030
well my wife and I,
well I'm here actually with my wife and 

1992
02:00:19,030 --> 02:00:23,051
my mother who I don't normally travel 
with and my aunt and they came along for

1993
02:00:24,021 --> 02:00:25,730
the adventure because I had invited 
them.

1994
02:00:25,731 --> 02:00:30,731
I'm traveling with my wife to many,
many places and I asked members of my 

1995
02:00:30,731 --> 02:00:33,650
extended family if they wanted to have a
bit of an adventure that they could pick

1996
02:00:33,651 --> 02:00:34,460
a place to come.

1997
02:00:34,460 --> 02:00:39,460
And My mother and my aunt picked Iceland
and everyone here has been ridiculously 

1998
02:00:41,601 --> 02:00:44,120
hospitable.
And so that's lovely.

1999
02:00:44,750 --> 02:00:49,750
And I've met lots of people in the 
street and outside these venues and 

2000
02:00:49,750 --> 02:00:53,201
everyone has been unfailingly polite and
welcoming and you have a beautiful 

2001
02:00:54,021 --> 02:00:59,021
little country and what you've done with
it is nothing short of miraculous as far

2002
02:01:00,651 --> 02:01:03,200
as I'm concerned.
It's beautiful,

2003
02:01:03,980 --> 02:01:06,440
it's peaceful,
it's thriving,

2004
02:01:06,860 --> 02:01:08,990
it's stable,
it's free.

2005
02:01:09,470 --> 02:01:11,840
It's like great.
I love,

2006
02:01:12,200 --> 02:01:16,520
I love coming to countries like this and
I do think there are absolute miracles.

2007
02:01:17,090 --> 02:01:22,090
Life is a real catastrophe.
And yet look at how wonderful it is here

2008
02:01:23,060 --> 02:01:25,730
and it's not like it's easy.
This isn't an easy place to live.

2009
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:30,760
It's a hard place and yet you've.
You've done a tremendous amount with 

2010
02:01:31,911 --> 02:01:36,911
what you have in front of you and so 
more power to you as far as I'm 

2011
02:01:36,911 --> 02:01:38,180
concerned.
I've had a wonderful time here.

2012
02:01:40,530 --> 02:01:45,530
Thanks very much.
It's been a real honor to be here and to

2013
02:01:58,851 --> 02:01:59,690
talk to all of you.
