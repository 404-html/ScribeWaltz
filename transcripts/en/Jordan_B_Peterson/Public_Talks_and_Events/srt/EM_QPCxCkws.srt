1
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:10,850
Yeah,
when I get get from a coma,

2
00:00:12,161 --> 00:00:15,850
I'm going to switch to English since we 
have.

3
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:21,130
Since Jordan hasn't had Dr.
Peterson hasn't had time to learn enough

4
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,500
icelandic.
Yeah.

5
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,230
Um,
so thank you all for coming.

6
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:28,570
This has been amazing.
Uh,

7
00:00:28,571 --> 00:00:31,930
first when I got the idea to book into 
Iceland,

8
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:35,020
I had no idea that others had been 
watching him on youtube.

9
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,720
Um,
so as it turns out,

10
00:00:37,721 --> 00:00:42,721
a lot of people have been and of course 
he's exploded since then in popularity.

11
00:00:44,531 --> 00:00:49,510
So we've sold out this venue which is 
almost three times larger than the first

12
00:00:49,511 --> 00:00:52,240
one we had and we've sold it out two 
times,

13
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:53,500
so that's pretty good.

14
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:59,280
Thank you.

15
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,920
So,
um,

16
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,600
he's gonna come up here and he's going 
to speak for one hour and 15 minutes 

17
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,890
just about,
um,

18
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:18,950
then he's going to take a four minute 
break and go off stage before the q and 

19
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,240
a,
um,

20
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:25,610
you can submit questions to the q and a 
and we're gonna use a similar system 

21
00:01:26,581 --> 00:01:30,660
that he's been using on his trips in 
America with Dave Ruben.

22
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,790
So I'm going to serve as a surrogate.
Dave Rubin here are slightly less gay,

23
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,100
Dave Rubin.
So,

24
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,670
and I'll bring,
I'll,

25
00:01:41,671 --> 00:01:46,671
I'll,
I'll ask him the questions and you will 

26
00:01:46,671 --> 00:01:49,071
put them online on a site called slido.
So it's spelled l I dropped the O 

27
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:58,340
slideshow,
I'll say it in Icelandic as well as a 

28
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:02,380
punter,
dia or slidell.

29
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,450
Um,
so,

30
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:11,640
um,
it is customary to introduce the speaker

31
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,700
as if you know me better than him.
Um,

32
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,160
but,
and,

33
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,950
and usually when someone is being 
introduced,

34
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,170
uh,
people tell things about him,

35
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:27,260
things that are true about that speaker.
Now of course you've all come here 

36
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,310
because you know who that guy is.
Um,

37
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,360
but so,
and I'm going to do a different thing 

38
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,300
because I think it has tells you more 
deeply something about what is going on 

39
00:02:39,061 --> 00:02:44,061
with this guy.
So I'm going to read you a few things 

40
00:02:44,061 --> 00:02:48,261
that are wrong about him.
So these are actual things that have 

41
00:02:50,431 --> 00:02:55,431
been said about him in media,
mostly in hit pieces and um,

42
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:02,190
you know,
character assassination attempts and 

43
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:05,370
there has been one each day just about 
for a long time and some of them and be 

44
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:07,780
big media.
So He's,

45
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:11,050
he's a bright guy,
Hitler,

46
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:14,590
he wants to force young women into 
marriage.

47
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:20,490
He's the stupid people's smart person 
that's actually not that bad about him,

48
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:26,910
but so,
and that's the reason they say that they

49
00:03:29,801 --> 00:03:34,750
want you to become afraid to admit that 
you like him or go to his talks,

50
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,550
well groomed,
alter,

51
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:40,180
right.
At least he's well groomed,

52
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:42,320
um,
a messiah come,

53
00:03:42,321 --> 00:03:47,321
surrogate dad for gormless dimwits.
So that's another one directed that you,

54
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:51,400
um,
I,

55
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:56,500
I,
I'm one of you as well because I don't 

56
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:56,500
know what gormless means.
So,

57
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:01,021
but I,
I suspect that having a quorum is 

58
00:04:01,021 --> 00:04:03,841
preferable.
So just stay away from this guy them 

59
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:09,940
with Jordan.
Peterson has nothing of value to say.

60
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:15,870
He's a patriarchal pseudo scientists.
He encourages young men to see 

61
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:18,100
themselves as victims.
He's a Mashup of.

62
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:23,430
He has delivered a Mashup of cosmo tips.
And my first book of myths,

63
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,870
he's the professor of piffle.
Um,

64
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:31,950
he seems like a terrible therapist is a 
bad political and social thinker,

65
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,180
an angry white guy.

66
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:40,650
And the line between Peterson's 
authoritarianism and Richard Spencer's 

67
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:44,581
Paleo Nazi-ism is a blurry one.
He's a Jewish shill.

68
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:49,630
And if you're going to be a shill,
you want to be a Jewish shoe,

69
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:52,570
um,
and he's a fascist.

70
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,270
Ms,
Mr.

71
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,880
This is just a small sample of what has 
been going on and it's all wrong 

72
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,630
perhaps,
you know,

73
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:04,080
depending on how you define chill,
chill,

74
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:07,120
she'll is okay,
but it's all wrong.

75
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:12,510
And that tells you something,
a new one everyday to miss informed 

76
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:16,720
people about that man.
And you can demonstrate it.

77
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:21,750
It's demonstratively false everything.
And there are some people that see him 

78
00:05:24,671 --> 00:05:29,671
as a risk to their agenda and their 
world view for some reason,

79
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,830
but he's a,
he's a reasonable,

80
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,290
a balanced,
moderate,

81
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:40,350
truthful man.
And I've never seen such a campaign 

82
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:42,570
against any thinker ever in the world,
uh,

83
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,720
not even someone that is untruthful or 
ask this despicable as they make him 

84
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:48,880
sound like.

85
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:51,850
Um,
so this tells you something.

86
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:56,851
This is the reason I was reading this.
This tells you something about the 

87
00:05:56,851 --> 00:06:00,931
importance of his message.
And I'm not gonna I'm not gonna theorize

88
00:06:02,001 --> 00:06:07,001
about exactly what that is,
because there are lots of theories about

89
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:11,240
exactly what it is in what he's saying 
that is threatening.

90
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:16,320
And to whom it is threatening and I 
think actually many of them are correct,

91
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:22,930
but let's just listen to him and let's 
hear what he has to say and we'll,

92
00:06:24,631 --> 00:06:26,570
we'll figure out why it's threatening 
later.

93
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:32,320
So please give a warm welcome to Dr 
Jordan b Peterson.

94
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:01,770
Thanks.

95
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,680
Well,
that's an introduction that I'm going to

96
00:07:16,681 --> 00:07:21,681
have to live up to.
So I was thinking the other day about 

97
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,430
numbers.
You know,

98
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:41,450
there are mathematicians who think that 
there isn't anything more real than 

99
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:45,150
numbers.
And that's an interesting proposition.

100
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:50,390
I mean it's obviously the case that once
you invent or discover numbers that that

101
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:59,990
confers on you a tremendous power and 
who knows the limits of that power and 

102
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:08,100
the claim that numbers are more real 
than anything else is predicated in part

103
00:08:08,231 --> 00:08:12,010
on the fact that when you discovered 
them or invent them and start to utilize

104
00:08:12,011 --> 00:08:17,011
them,
that your ability to operate in the 

105
00:08:17,011 --> 00:08:20,390
world expands immensely.
And,

106
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:25,430
and so that's one of the ways of judging
whether or not something is real is 

107
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:29,400
whether or not when you use it 
facilitates your means of operating in 

108
00:08:30,311 --> 00:08:33,370
the world.
Interestingly,

109
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:39,270
numbers are abstractions and so that 
raises another question which is,

110
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,780
well,
what's more real,

111
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:52,990
the thing that's being abstracted from 
or the abstractions and again,

112
00:08:53,001 --> 00:08:57,960
that's not obvious and maybe the 
question of more real isn't Germane.

113
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:03,350
Maybe it's a question of equal reality,
but it's not obvious that abstractions 

114
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:07,221
aren't real and you can make a damn 
strong case that there are more real 

115
00:09:07,221 --> 00:09:09,240
than anything else,
and so then you might ask yourself,

116
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:12,960
well then what are the most real 
abstractions?

117
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,310
And so that's what I'm going to start to
talk about tonight.

118
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:22,850
I'm going to talk about it in 
relationship to as many rules as I can 

119
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:29,460
lay out simultaneously.
I'll go through the rules first.

120
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:34,170
So rule one is stand up straight with 
your shoulders back,

121
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:40,130
and rule two is treat yourself like 
you're someone responsible for helping a

122
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:48,320
number three,
which is very tightly associated with 

123
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,841
number two.
There are sort of variations on a theme 

124
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:52,200
is make friends with those people who 
want the best for you.

125
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:58,190
And by the way,
these last two rules aren't injunctions 

126
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:00,900
designed to make your life easier.
They're actually injunctions designed to

127
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:05,901
make your life more difficult.
Character Guard said at one point that 

128
00:10:05,901 --> 00:10:10,821
his role in life,
given that everything was proceeding to 

129
00:10:10,821 --> 00:10:12,360
become easier and easier in all possible
ways,

130
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:16,140
that there would come a time when people
would cry out for difficulty,

131
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,890
and so that's partly how he envisioned 
his role in the world.

132
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:24,600
Interestingly enough,
as a universal benefactor of mankind who

133
00:10:24,601 --> 00:10:28,770
would strive to do nothing other than to
make life more difficult for everyone.

134
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:34,370
Right?
And so rule two and three are like that 

135
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:36,650
because treat yourself as if you're 
someone responsible for helping isn't 

136
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:41,630
the same as be nice to yourself.
It's not that and to associate with 

137
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:46,131
people who want the best for you means 
that they get to demand the best from 

138
00:10:46,131 --> 00:10:47,970
you,
and that's also not an easy thing.

139
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:53,420
Rule four is compare yourself to who you
were yesterday and not to who someone 

140
00:10:53,881 --> 00:10:57,060
else is today,
and that's an injunction about envy,

141
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:59,380
right?
It's easy to.

142
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:04,670
You need people who you need things that
are above you because you need to do 

143
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:07,320
something worthwhile with your life.
You need something to a map,

144
00:11:07,321 --> 00:11:12,321
but one of the consequences of that is 
that you can become envious of people 

145
00:11:12,321 --> 00:11:16,971
that you believe have attained more in a
deserved or undeserved manner and that 

146
00:11:17,071 --> 00:11:22,071
can make you better and so it's much 
better to compare yourself to yourself 

147
00:11:22,071 --> 00:11:25,200
and to use yourself as the target for 
improvement and comparison.

148
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:29,700
Rule five is don't let your children do 
anything that makes you dislike them and

149
00:11:29,701 --> 00:11:32,640
the rule of thumb there is if you 
dislike them,

150
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:37,700
then other people will and it's a bad 
idea to allow your children to act in a 

151
00:11:38,461 --> 00:11:43,110
way that makes other children disliked 
them or adults disliked them,

152
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:48,350
given that they're going to have to deal
with children and they're going to have 

153
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:48,350
to deal with adults.

154
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:52,640
So your primary responsibility as a 
parent is to help your child learn how 

155
00:11:52,801 --> 00:11:57,801
to behave so that the social world opens
up its arms to them and welcomes them at

156
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:03,190
every level and you've done your job.
If you can manage that,

157
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:08,250
and it's not a simple thing to do.
Rule six is put your house in perfect 

158
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:12,811
order before you criticize the world,
and that's not take no action for others

159
00:12:16,031 --> 00:12:19,300
until you have your act together that 
isn't what the rule means.

160
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:24,660
It means that bind your ambition with 
humility and work on what's right in 

161
00:12:27,161 --> 00:12:30,580
front of you that you will suffer for if
you get wrong,

162
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:35,800
before you engage in the large scale 
transformation of other people.

163
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:42,390
Rule seven is do what is meaningful and 
not what is expedient and I would say in

164
00:12:43,811 --> 00:12:48,811
some sense in some sense,
that's the core ethos of the book.

165
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:55,680
Not exactly because rule eight,
which is tell the truth or at least 

166
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,951
don't lie as a necessary conjunction to 
that are unnecessary additional element 

167
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:04,950
because I don't think that you can 
pursue what is meaningful without 

168
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:08,401
telling the truth.
And the reason for that is if you don't 

169
00:13:08,401 --> 00:13:11,131
tell the truth or let's say if you lie,
which is an easier way to think about 

170
00:13:11,131 --> 00:13:12,040
it.
You corrupt the mechanisms,

171
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:17,041
the instinctual mechanisms that that,
that manifest themselves as meaning and 

172
00:13:17,891 --> 00:13:21,340
then you can't trust them and that's a 
very bad idea.

173
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,760
So the fundamental reason to not lie is 
because you corrupt your own 

174
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,000
perceptions.
If you lie,

175
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:30,040
and when you corrupt your own 
perceptions,

176
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:33,520
then you can't rely on yourself.
And if you can't rely on yourself,

177
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:38,521
then well good luck to you because what 
are you going to rely on in the absence 

178
00:13:38,521 --> 00:13:39,550
of your own judgment?

179
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:42,070
Your you've got nothing.
If you,

180
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:47,100
if you lose that rule,
rule eight a is,

181
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,960
as I said,
tell the truth or don't,

182
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:52,150
or at least don't lie.
Rule nine,

183
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:58,740
assume that the person that you're 
listening to know something you don't 

184
00:13:58,740 --> 00:13:59,890
know.
That's not so much a mark of respect for

185
00:13:59,891 --> 00:14:04,891
the person,
although it is that it's a mark of 

186
00:14:04,891 --> 00:14:05,590
recognition of your own unbearable 
ignorance.

187
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:08,110
You know,
one of the things you have to do in life

188
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:14,010
is decide whether you're more.
You have to make friends more with.

189
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:16,990
Let me see.
Let me,

190
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:22,210
let me rephrase that properly.
You have to decide what's more 

191
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:24,160
important,
what you know or what you don't know.

192
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,150
First of all,
there's a lot of what you don't know and

193
00:14:28,151 --> 00:14:31,690
so if you make friends with that,
if you decide that's important,

194
00:14:31,691 --> 00:14:36,691
then well that's a good thing because 
you're going to be surrounded by what 

195
00:14:36,691 --> 00:14:38,890
you don't know your entire life and so 
if you're appreciative of that,

196
00:14:38,891 --> 00:14:41,320
then that's going to make things go 
better for you.

197
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:45,310
But,
but the other element of that is,

198
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:51,240
well,
why should you be appreciative of what 

199
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:51,240
you don't know?
An answer to that is,

200
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:51,440
well,
you shouldn't.

201
00:14:51,441 --> 00:14:56,360
If you're life is absolutely perfect in 
every way you have exactly what you need

202
00:14:56,361 --> 00:15:01,361
and want.
You've put everything in order around 

203
00:15:01,361 --> 00:15:04,421
you then what you know is sufficient,
but if you believe that things could 

204
00:15:04,421 --> 00:15:08,771
still be put right around you in your 
own personal life and with regard to the

205
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:12,420
effect that you have another people,
then obviously what you don't yet know,

206
00:15:12,421 --> 00:15:17,421
it was more important than what you do 
know and you should be paying attention 

207
00:15:17,421 --> 00:15:18,920
to find out what you don't know at every
possible moment.

208
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:24,190
And if you're fortunate,
when you have a conversation with 

209
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,340
someone and you're actually interested 
in what they say,

210
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:28,760
then even if they're not very good at 
communicating,

211
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:33,790
even if they're awkward or even if they 
display a certain amount of enmity 

212
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:35,390
towards you,
there's always the possibility that they

213
00:15:35,391 --> 00:15:39,290
might tell you something you don't know,
in which case you can walk away from the

214
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:44,291
conversation less ignorant and corrupt 
than you were when you started the 

215
00:15:44,421 --> 00:15:45,290
conversation.

216
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:48,680
And if your life isn't everything that 
you would like it to be,

217
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:52,970
than being slightly less ignorant and 
corrupt is probably a good thing.

218
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:58,460
And so rule 10 is be precise in your 
speech and that's.

219
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:04,030
That's an observation.
I would say that that's a variant of a 

220
00:16:04,311 --> 00:16:09,311
new testament injunction,
which is or maybe a description of the 

221
00:16:09,311 --> 00:16:13,061
nature of the world which is knock and 
the door will open and ask and you will 

222
00:16:13,061 --> 00:16:16,790
receive,
which is a very strange theory,

223
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:22,150
let's say,
but which I would say is far more in 

224
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:24,380
accordance with what we know about the 
psychology of perception,

225
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,600
let's say,
than you might imagine.

226
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:32,050
Because it is the case that you don't 
get.

227
00:16:33,111 --> 00:16:37,520
What you don't aim at,
you might get what you do,

228
00:16:37,521 --> 00:16:40,400
a mat and your aim might get better as 
you aim as well,

229
00:16:40,401 --> 00:16:41,660
which is something to consider

230
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:48,150
if you specify the nature of the 
actually.

231
00:16:48,151 --> 00:16:52,200
If you specify the nature of the being 
that you want to bring into being,

232
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,560
then you radically increase the 
probability that that's what will occur 

233
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,531
and of course you all know that because 
you regard yourself at least to some 

234
00:17:00,531 --> 00:17:03,210
degree as active creative agents,
right?

235
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:08,240
Your fundamental attitude towards 
yourself at at least in the manner that 

236
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:13,700
you act towards yourself is that you 
wake up in the morning and you have a 

237
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:18,081
landscape of possibilities that lay 
themselves open to you and you make 

238
00:17:18,081 --> 00:17:22,581
choices between those possibilities and 
determined in consequence how the world 

239
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:26,850
is going to manifest itself.
So you confront a field of potential.

240
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:32,060
That's a good way of thinking about it 
and through your choices you determine 

241
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:35,930
which elements of that potential are 
going to concretize them selves into the

242
00:17:35,941 --> 00:17:40,941
real world and you are very unhappy with
yourself.

243
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,520
If you don't do that properly and you're
very unhappy with other people.

244
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:47,760
If they don't do that properly and 
you're very unhappy with other people,

245
00:17:47,761 --> 00:17:52,761
if they don't treat like that's what 
you're like because part of what you 

246
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,760
demand from people,
let's say in terms of sheer civility is 

247
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:02,400
that they act towards you is if you're 
the locus of voluntary choice in a world

248
00:18:02,401 --> 00:18:05,610
of potential and you are braid each 
other for that as well.

249
00:18:05,611 --> 00:18:09,660
If you have children and parents,
your parents will say to you,

250
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:12,630
if you're fortunate,
you're not living up to your potential,

251
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,720
which is actually a compliment in a 
sense,

252
00:18:15,721 --> 00:18:20,721
even though it's also a judgment and the
compliment is I know perfectly well that

253
00:18:21,331 --> 00:18:26,331
you could be more than you are and 
you'll hang your head if you have any 

254
00:18:26,331 --> 00:18:28,290
sense and you'll think like you think in
relationship to your own conscience that

255
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:33,440
yes,
I have a lot of potential that I'm not 

256
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,321
fully realizing and that actually 
constitutes a transgression against the 

257
00:18:36,321 --> 00:18:37,380
good and I don't.

258
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,530
I don't think I've ever met anyone who 
doesn't believe that.

259
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:45,560
If you.
If you have a reasonable conversation 

260
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,250
with them,
it just seems self evident.

261
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:52,550
I mean,
maybe now and then you meet someone 

262
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:53,580
who's narcissistically self satisfied,
but then they're narcissistic and that's

263
00:18:53,581 --> 00:18:54,660
not good.
That as a,

264
00:18:54,661 --> 00:18:59,661
as a medium to longterm strategy,
that's a catastrophe that ends in 

265
00:18:59,661 --> 00:18:59,940
disaster.
You know?

266
00:18:59,941 --> 00:19:01,890
It's a short term.
It protects people,

267
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:05,310
but longterm it's.
It's not good in the least,

268
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:07,290
and of course other people don't 
appreciate it as well.

269
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:12,620
Rule 11 is don't bother children when 
they're skateboarding and that's 

270
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:16,851
actually a discussion of courage,
of encouragement more more specifically 

271
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,530
because I've.
I've been trying to understand,

272
00:19:19,531 --> 00:19:24,531
for example,
what role parents play in the lives of 

273
00:19:24,531 --> 00:19:28,221
their children and I would say this is a
role that that that is a fundamental 

274
00:19:28,221 --> 00:19:33,201
importance as well as attempting to 
guide your children so that they act in 

275
00:19:33,571 --> 00:19:37,710
a socially desirable manner so that the 
world opens itself up to them.

276
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:43,160
You also want to encourage them,
which is not the same as sheltering 

277
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,670
them.
It's not the same at all.

278
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,790
And to encourage someone is to say 
something like,

279
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:49,800
or to act out something like,
look,

280
00:19:49,801 --> 00:19:54,801
kid,
as you move the world is already 

281
00:19:54,801 --> 00:19:58,881
difficult because the world isn't easy 
for children anymore than it's easy for 

282
00:19:58,881 --> 00:20:00,240
adults that the difficulties are.
They're not the same,

283
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:03,390
their child sized difficulties,
but there are still difficulties.

284
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:09,260
The world is a very hard place and it's 
a bitter place in many ways and it's not

285
00:20:10,051 --> 00:20:15,051
only a hard and bitter place.
It's also touched with betrayal and 

286
00:20:15,051 --> 00:20:16,680
malevolence and that's the fundamental 
bottom line,

287
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:22,070
but there's something in you that is 
capable of taking that full on and 

288
00:20:23,401 --> 00:20:26,940
transcending it and that's 
encouragement.

289
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:28,020
You say,
well,

290
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:33,440
as difficult as things are Europe to the
challenge and to interfere with children

291
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:37,350
when they're skateboarding,
for example,

292
00:20:37,351 --> 00:20:42,351
when they're doing,
let's say in advisably dangerous things 

293
00:20:42,351 --> 00:20:44,490
which kids of course do,
if they're skateboarding.

294
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:48,130
To interfere with that is to interfere

295
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:53,130
with the child's willingness to 
voluntarily expose themselves to the 

296
00:20:53,321 --> 00:20:58,321
risks that they need to expose 
themselves to in order to develop this 

297
00:20:58,351 --> 00:21:03,351
sort of competence that allows them to 
thrive in a world they cannot be 

298
00:21:03,351 --> 00:21:07,891
sheltered from and so to interfere with 
children when they're taking necessary 

299
00:21:09,551 --> 00:21:14,551
risks is not love or empathy,
but cowardice on the part of parents and

300
00:21:14,861 --> 00:21:19,861
it's deeply damaging to children.
And I can tell you as a clinical 

301
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:23,341
psychologist,
I've never had a client come to my 

302
00:21:23,341 --> 00:21:24,490
office and all the hundreds in,
in,

303
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:28,630
in all of the hundreds of encounters 
I've had with people in my office.

304
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:33,490
I've never had a client say my parents 
made me to independent.

305
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:37,510
Right.
That hasn't happened once.

306
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:43,290
Right now my parents made me too 
dependent or I conspired with my parents

307
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:49,600
to perpetuate my dependence.
That happened all the time.

308
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:54,010
So there's a rule of thumb,
which I think is a good one,

309
00:21:54,011 --> 00:21:59,011
which I believe is often applied in 
nursing homes by people who work in 

310
00:21:59,011 --> 00:22:00,310
nursing homes,
which is of course a very difficult job.

311
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:05,020
And the rule is do not do anything for 
anyone they can do for themselves.

312
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:08,530
And the reason for that is that it's a 
form of theft,

313
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,090
right?
You don't.

314
00:22:10,091 --> 00:22:11,080
First of all,
if you,

315
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:15,100
if you do something for someone and it 
facilitates their movement forward,

316
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:18,190
then they moved forward because you 
helped them.

317
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,730
Which is something I was very careful 
about as a therapist.

318
00:22:21,731 --> 00:22:26,590
I don't want to give my clients advice 
first I it might fail,

319
00:22:26,591 --> 00:22:30,670
in which case they are going to pay for 
my advice and second,

320
00:22:30,671 --> 00:22:34,300
if it succeeds,
then I get to be the successful one.

321
00:22:34,301 --> 00:22:37,300
And I don't want to steal the success 
from my clients.

322
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:42,480
That's a bad idea.
I want to help them figure out what it 

323
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,880
is that they should aim at and then help
plot out a strategy for attaining that.

324
00:22:45,881 --> 00:22:46,770
And,
but I,

325
00:22:46,771 --> 00:22:51,771
I,
I want to ensure that it's their 

326
00:22:51,771 --> 00:22:52,510
destiny,
not something I'm imposing.

327
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,290
And of course the imposition of that 
sort of thing is the hallmark of a bad,

328
00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:01,120
I would say therapeutic relationship,
but also a bad relationship period.

329
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:04,090
Right?
So one of the things you want to do with

330
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,500
your partners,
your spouse,

331
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:10,520
your say,
your husband or wife and also with your 

332
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,171
children is to listen to them so that 
you can figure out what their problems 

333
00:23:13,171 --> 00:23:17,191
are and figure out with them because 
they're going to figure that out by 

334
00:23:17,191 --> 00:23:19,630
communicating and then perhaps aid them 
in the development of a strategy.

335
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:24,631
But you have to ensure very carefully 
that you're not imposing your own 

336
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:30,150
structure in a manner that's going to 
steal from them what's rightfully 

337
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,900
theirs.
So,

338
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:37,270
so rule 11 is an injunction to courage 
as the fundamental,

339
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:42,630
because you could say,
well what's the antidote to the 

340
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:42,760
catastrophe of life?
And one answer might be safety.

341
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:43,750
It's like,
well,

342
00:23:43,751 --> 00:23:44,440
you know,
look,

343
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:46,100
everyone's sensible enough to

344
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,640
know that a certain amount of provision 
for safety is,

345
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:52,940
is worthwhile.
You should probably wear your seat belts

346
00:23:52,941 --> 00:23:57,350
when you're driving around in your car 
because why take foolhardy risks?

347
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:02,750
But given that there is no security in 
life in the final analysis,

348
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:07,790
then encouragement is a much better 
medication than sheltering.

349
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,220
And so,
and that's what,

350
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:16,300
that's,
that's I think in keeping with the idea 

351
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:19,540
that what life is essentially is not a 
place to attain happiness or even to aim

352
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:25,751
for happiness even though you should be 
grateful if someone comes along now and 

353
00:24:25,751 --> 00:24:26,960
then,
but a call to something like adventure,

354
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:30,650
and I think that's the proper way of 
conceptualizing it.

355
00:24:30,651 --> 00:24:33,550
Certainly if you go watch a story,
a movie,

356
00:24:33,551 --> 00:24:35,540
you read a book,
something like that.

357
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:38,480
If you encounter a narrative that's 
gripping,

358
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:41,870
whether it's a romance or a classic 
adventure story,

359
00:24:41,871 --> 00:24:45,560
then the element of it that's gripping 
is the adventure.

360
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:51,130
And so to portray life as an adventure 
in romance and and in the world is the 

361
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:55,751
proper way to portray it.
And the way that you facilitate the 

362
00:24:57,801 --> 00:25:01,490
adventure is through encouragement.
I had a client once,

363
00:25:01,491 --> 00:25:03,170
I really liked him.
He was a good guy,

364
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:05,780
smart guy,
good looking young guy,

365
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,210
had everything going for him.
You know,

366
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:10,640
he's a good musician.
He was a talented athlete,

367
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:18,650
but he hadn't been encouraged.
I wouldn't say he told me about his 

368
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:19,950
relationship with his girlfriend.
He said,

369
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:20,120
no,

370
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:25,990
his girlfriend wanted to go biking 
around southern Ontario.

371
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:31,830
She was about 19 or 20 and he thought he
might join her and when she went and 

372
00:25:31,931 --> 00:25:36,931
talked to her parents,
they made every provision possible to 

373
00:25:36,931 --> 00:25:40,270
help her prepare for the journey to make
sure her bike was in good shape,

374
00:25:40,271 --> 00:25:44,380
to make sure she had the right equipment
to help her plot out a route and when he

375
00:25:44,381 --> 00:25:49,381
went and talked to his parents,
all they did was worried that he was 

376
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,841
going to get hurt and like he might get 
hurt because people get hurt,

377
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:58,290
but they didn't understand that they 
were choosing between the hurt that he 

378
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:00,460
might encounter by going out in the 
world and having an adventure,

379
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:05,640
let's say with his girlfriend or the 
hurt that he would encounter by staying 

380
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:09,331
at home,
powering in his basement under the 

381
00:26:09,331 --> 00:26:09,820
protection of his over loving parents.

382
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:12,280
Well,
his girlfriend ventured bravely into the

383
00:26:12,281 --> 00:26:13,450
world.
You think,

384
00:26:13,451 --> 00:26:15,310
well,
which of those two things is most likely

385
00:26:15,311 --> 00:26:17,350
to be damaging?
And their answer to that is,

386
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:19,840
well,
his parents wouldn't worry as much as if

387
00:26:19,841 --> 00:26:22,330
he.
If he was in the basement and that's the

388
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:25,630
wrong worry even because they should 
worry more,

389
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:31,470
not less so in rural 12,
his pedicab when you encounter one on 

390
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:36,391
the street and it's a oddly enough,
a meditation on fragility.

391
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:44,310
It's a discussion of what you do when 
you don't know what do and that's really

392
00:26:44,671 --> 00:26:49,200
when things have gone badly for you.
When you face a terrible tragedy in your

393
00:26:49,201 --> 00:26:53,100
own personal life or in your familiar 
life or perhaps even in the life of your

394
00:26:53,101 --> 00:26:55,530
community.
When things come crowding in and you too

395
00:26:55,531 --> 00:27:00,531
quickly in,
in the case of a death in the family or 

396
00:27:00,531 --> 00:27:03,921
a terrible illness or the collapse of a 
dream or any of the things that can flip

397
00:27:04,111 --> 00:27:04,620
your world.

398
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:09,620
Upside down is how do you cope with that
and that chapter contains discussion of 

399
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,710
the necessity of narrowing your 
timeframe.

400
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:20,250
You know,
because sometimes the right way to look 

401
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:22,701
at the world is across years and 
sometimes it's across months and when 

402
00:27:22,701 --> 00:27:26,280
things are more out of control,
perhaps it's across days and when things

403
00:27:26,281 --> 00:27:28,590
are really.
When you're really up against the wall,

404
00:27:28,591 --> 00:27:33,591
it's a car across hours or even minutes 
and during those minutes than you 

405
00:27:33,871 --> 00:27:38,871
concentrate on doing as well as you can 
with what's right in front of you for 

406
00:27:38,871 --> 00:27:42,090
the longest unit of time that you can 
tolerate conceptualizing.

407
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:47,450
Maybe that's what you do at someone's 
deathbed and while you're doing that in 

408
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:51,290
suffering away madly,
then you also take the time to 

409
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:53,070
appreciate everything you can.
That manifests itself.

410
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:57,960
That allows itself to be appreciated.
And so that's the metaphor of the cat,

411
00:27:57,990 --> 00:27:58,950
I suppose.

412
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:04,430
And so that's the 12 rules and I'll 
return to rule one which is stand up 

413
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:08,661
straight with your shoulders back,
and I'm going to use it as a platform 

414
00:28:08,661 --> 00:28:12,710
for laying out the abstractions that I 
talked to at the beginning of the 

415
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:17,300
lecture.
So some of you might be familiar with 

416
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:21,231
the central Dallas symbol and it's a 
symbol of dao and dow is a very strange 

417
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:27,710
word.
It doesn't have an easily translatable 

418
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:29,130
single meaning.
At least in English.

419
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:32,430
It means a variety of things.
That means the path of life.

420
00:28:32,431 --> 00:28:36,210
So that would mean the the path that you
take as you move forward through life,

421
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,550
but it would mean more also the proper 
path.

422
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:40,890
So it's that it's the proper path 
through life.

423
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:46,040
So the idea dow is a symbol of reality 
and one of the things that means is the 

424
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:50,961
path you take through life.
And so there's an implicit idea there 

425
00:28:50,961 --> 00:28:53,790
that the fundamental reality of life is 
the path you take through life.

426
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:57,180
It's not a materialist idea,
it's a different kind of idea.

427
00:28:57,330 --> 00:29:02,330
It's the idea that life is a journey 
while we're mobile creatures and we're 

428
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:06,231
on a journey and the best way to 
conceptualize reality has as the place 

429
00:29:06,231 --> 00:29:08,070
that you journey through and the 
question is,

430
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,930
well,
what are the elements?

431
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:13,320
What are the constituent elements of the
place that you journey through?

432
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:18,360
Because that's also part of Dow and the 
Dallas believed that that's the Yin and 

433
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:21,951
Yang,
and Yin is the black serpent because 

434
00:29:21,951 --> 00:29:23,550
those are two serpent's head to head 
that make up the totality of the world,

435
00:29:23,551 --> 00:29:27,900
and the black serpent is Yin and Yang.
Yin is feminine.

436
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:30,540
Classically speaking from the Taoist 
perspective,

437
00:29:30,541 --> 00:29:35,541
it's a symbolic representation.
It doesn't mean that women or men and 

438
00:29:35,541 --> 00:29:36,480
that men,
men aren't.

439
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:41,540
It's not that it's an attempt to use 
sexual symbolism to a deeper underlying 

440
00:29:42,761 --> 00:29:44,950
reality and Yang is masculine.

441
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:49,930
Urine is dark and night and there's a 
white.in

442
00:29:49,931 --> 00:29:52,980
the block serpent and there's a black.in
the white serpent.

443
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:57,990
The serpent is the daytime and 
masculinity and it's the interplay 

444
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:02,011
between those two things that make up 
reality and one can transform into the 

445
00:30:02,011 --> 00:30:06,211
other at any moment,
and so that's the Taoist idea of 

446
00:30:06,211 --> 00:30:09,480
reality.
And so there's Yin and Yang and they 

447
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,151
make up the world.
And the question is perhaps that 

448
00:30:12,151 --> 00:30:12,151
question is,
well,

449
00:30:12,151 --> 00:30:14,470
what exactly does that mean?
Well,

450
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:19,680
it actually means something.
It's a kind of abstraction and it's 

451
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,260
actually an incredibly helpful 
obstruction.

452
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:25,740
Once you understand the abstraction,
it might be the most real abstraction 

453
00:30:25,961 --> 00:30:30,961
there is.
So I'm going to lay out a little bit a 

454
00:30:30,961 --> 00:30:34,471
layout for you,
a little bit about what these two 

455
00:30:34,471 --> 00:30:36,331
domains refer to and then I'm going to 
make a case that they're real and then 

456
00:30:36,331 --> 00:30:38,860
I'm going to tell you what it means that
they're real.

457
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:44,820
So you could think of Yin as chaos.
Now we need to know what chaos is now.

458
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:53,080
Chaos is what God made the world out of 
at the beginning of time.

459
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:57,640
So one of the things that chaos is this,
it's something like potential.

460
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:03,810
And so you can imagine,
and this is not how we think as modern 

461
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:04,180
people because we tend to think in a 
materialist way,

462
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:06,700
but it is how we act.
And as I said already,

463
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:12,210
you act as if you confront potential and
you treat potential as if it's real.

464
00:31:14,351 --> 00:31:19,060
And if your attitude towards it confers 
on us certain moral obligation,

465
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:24,270
which is why you know what people mean 
when they say you're not living up to 

466
00:31:24,701 --> 00:31:27,460
your potential.
No one ever says,

467
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:33,570
well what do you mean by potential?
Not unless they're being argumentative 

468
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:35,770
because you already know and very few 
people say,

469
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:38,080
well,
I'm fully living up to my potential.

470
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:43,290
So you admit to the reality that 
undergirds that conception that makes 

471
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:45,880
that question and possibility 
immediately.

472
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:50,380
The potential is while potential is the 
future,

473
00:31:50,381 --> 00:31:53,620
that's part of it,
and we believe in the future.

474
00:31:53,621 --> 00:31:57,730
We believe that it exists even though it
isn't here and it's not measurable.

475
00:31:57,731 --> 00:32:02,731
It's it only exists as a potential set 
of realizable possibilities.

476
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:05,920
That's what the future is and it's 
really what we contend with.

477
00:32:05,921 --> 00:32:08,470
We don't really contend with the present
precisely.

478
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:13,620
We Orient Ourselves towards the future 
and the future comes at us from every 

479
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:17,461
direction and we we,
we decide as we encounter the future,

480
00:32:17,891 --> 00:32:22,891
which parts of it we're going to 
interact with and how we're going to 

481
00:32:22,891 --> 00:32:25,240
construct the present and the past.
As a consequence of doing that.

482
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:29,710
And so part of chaos is potential and 
that's the positive part.

483
00:32:29,711 --> 00:32:34,711
It's like if you're in a bind,
what you look for is potential.

484
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:36,910
Is there another way of conceptualizing 
this?

485
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:39,410
Do I have a different way of,
of

486
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:42,500
acting?
Can I make another plan?

487
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:47,710
Is there something that I'm not taking 
into account that would make this 

488
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:51,311
terrible situation tolerable?
That's all an attempt to to call upon 

489
00:32:51,471 --> 00:32:56,471
potential and to use it to transfigure a
reality that's intolerable and maybe 

490
00:32:57,801 --> 00:33:00,580
it's intolerable because of the way 
you're conceptualizing it.

491
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:03,650
Now,
I'm not being naive about that.

492
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:08,000
I understand perfectly well that people 
can find themselves so badly cornered in

493
00:33:08,001 --> 00:33:11,690
life that they're basically done no 
matter what they do.

494
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:16,840
People obviously developed fatal 
illnesses and they die and their 

495
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:21,251
businesses collapsed and genuinely 
terrible things can happen to you that 

496
00:33:21,251 --> 00:33:23,810
aren't your fault,
that you can't fix.

497
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:29,380
I'm not saying that you can just 
gerrymander the world by changing your 

498
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:29,600
attitude.
It's not that straightforward,

499
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:35,260
but I am saying that you have a 
tremendous ability to transform the 

500
00:33:36,111 --> 00:33:41,111
landscape of possibility that reveals 
itself in front of you and that when 

501
00:33:41,111 --> 00:33:42,830
things are terrible,
that's your best bet.

502
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:48,570
It doesn't mean it will succeed.
It just means you don't have a better 

503
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:52,601
option and so chaos.
That potential is also something that 

504
00:33:52,601 --> 00:33:55,670
manifests itself in a terrible manner.
So imagine this.

505
00:33:55,671 --> 00:34:00,671
This is a good way of thinking about it.
So imagine that you have an intimate 

506
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:04,481
relationship,
let's say a marriage and the marriage is

507
00:34:04,941 --> 00:34:09,941
predicated on trust and fidelity,
which is a variant of trust and that 

508
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:15,760
trust and fidelity is an axiom of your 
memories.

509
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:16,970
You might think,
well,

510
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:18,170
what does that mean?
It's like,

511
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,850
well,
let's play it out.

512
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:25,060
Imagine you've been married for 10 years
and then your wife tells you that she 

513
00:34:25,341 --> 00:34:30,341
has had three affairs.
Each of them lasted three years and the 

514
00:34:30,341 --> 00:34:32,810
last one has lasted five years and it's 
still ongoing.

515
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:35,690
Or maybe you discover that,
okay,

516
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,820
so then you might say,
well,

517
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:41,180
what happens then?
Well,

518
00:34:41,181 --> 00:34:43,880
what happens is that everything you 
thought was wrong.

519
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:49,690
Right?
And this is such an interesting thing 

520
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:51,401
because it actually means you had the 
past and you think the past is fixed.

521
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,530
It's done with.
That's why it's the past.

522
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:58,280
But all of a sudden you find out that 
one of the things that you thought about

523
00:34:58,281 --> 00:35:00,680
the past and it happens to be a very 
important thing,

524
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:05,920
wasn't true at all.
And so what that means is that whole 

525
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,990
past that you thought was what it was,
wasn't what it was at all,

526
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:14,470
and so it transforms itself from an 
actuality into potential and most of 

527
00:35:15,891 --> 00:35:20,891
that potential is negative unless you're
relieved that your wife had an affair.

528
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:26,470
Well,
but that's an important consideration 

529
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:29,141
because you know you can imagine a 
situation where your marriage is 

530
00:35:29,141 --> 00:35:32,240
dreadfully unhappy and you're just 
looking for an excuse to leave.

531
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:35,960
It's possible that that revelation,
even though it would be shocking,

532
00:35:35,961 --> 00:35:38,250
would also come with a fair bit of 
relief.

533
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:41,400
And so this potential,
the potential that manifests itself,

534
00:35:41,401 --> 00:35:46,401
even when it's unexpected,
it doesn't only necessarily manifest 

535
00:35:46,401 --> 00:35:48,390
itself in a negative guys,
it can also free,

536
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,030
you know,
and if your marriage was unhappy,

537
00:35:51,031 --> 00:35:56,031
even if you wanted to cling to it,
if your marriage wasn't happy and the 

538
00:35:56,031 --> 00:36:00,920
betrayal was revealed and you're 
divorced and you set yourself up in two 

539
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:04,791
years,
you might be in a better place than you 

540
00:36:04,791 --> 00:36:06,471
were.
It's not a pathway I'm recommending by 

541
00:36:06,471 --> 00:36:08,991
the way.
I'm just saying that it's more 

542
00:36:08,991 --> 00:36:10,701
complicated than it looks.
That's the introduction of chaos into 

543
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:11,370
order.
Right?

544
00:36:11,371 --> 00:36:12,910
And the,
the,

545
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:18,080
the oldest story we have is something 
like order is susceptible to disruption 

546
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,920
by chaos and the human,
that the fundamental demand that's made 

547
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:32,000
on the human being is to contend with 
the chaos that disrupts order not to 

548
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:36,450
live in order and not to live in chaos,
but to be able to contend with the chaos

549
00:36:36,451 --> 00:36:37,440
that disrupts order.

550
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:40,140
And so when you encourage your children,
for example,

551
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,670
what you're doing is encouraging them to
become the masters of the chaos that can

552
00:36:44,671 --> 00:36:49,671
disrupt order rather than Denisons of 
order which makes them tyrants or 

553
00:36:49,671 --> 00:36:53,901
denizens of chaos,
which makes them nihilistic and 

554
00:36:53,901 --> 00:36:54,420
hopeless.
So you train your children,

555
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:59,480
you encourage your children and yourself
and your partner if you have any sense 

556
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:03,060
to be a master of emergent chaos and to 
be able to contend with that.

557
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:08,660
And so,
so chaos has potential and it's this 

558
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:13,610
disruptive.
It's the capacity of the infinite world 

559
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:17,010
to disrupt your finite considerations.
That's another way of looking at it.

560
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:22,250
Another way of looking at it is it's the
serpent in the garden of Eden and the 

561
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:27,021
reason that that story is set up the way
it is is because it's trying to 

562
00:37:27,021 --> 00:37:30,981
represent that there is no place that so
bounded and secure,

563
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:36,980
even if it's set up by God himself that 
doesn't have an agent of chaos inside 

564
00:37:37,891 --> 00:37:38,040
it.

565
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:41,820
It's exactly the same idea that the 
Dallas put forward with their,

566
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:47,270
with their symbolic representation.
It's just portrayed in a different 

567
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:48,030
manner.
The question is,

568
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:51,240
well,
what you do in the garden,

569
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:57,080
given that there's a snake in it and the
answer to that is something like you 

570
00:37:57,080 --> 00:38:01,431
become the master of snakes and so and 
that's a deep idea.

571
00:38:02,371 --> 00:38:06,300
That's the same idea as confronting the 
dragon in getting the treasure.

572
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:11,570
That's the same idea as going to the 
bottom of the ocean and rescue your 

573
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:15,681
father from the belly of the whale.
It's the same idea and that's an element

574
00:38:16,021 --> 00:38:19,530
in the greatest of stories and the 
greatest of stories is heroic,

575
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:23,760
heroic story and the heroic story is to 
voluntarily confront the unknown when it

576
00:38:23,761 --> 00:38:26,550
manifests itself and together something 
of value.

577
00:38:26,551 --> 00:38:29,100
As a consequence and to share it with 
the community,

578
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:34,580
there isn't a story that's more 
emblematic of what it means to be human 

579
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:36,190
then that,
that that is us.

580
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,180
That's our best bet.
All right,

581
00:38:40,181 --> 00:38:45,181
so chaos.
Chaos is the catastrophe that will 

582
00:38:45,181 --> 00:38:48,160
suddenly enter your life.
Chaos is the flood.

583
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:52,300
That's definitely coming.
Chaos is the ever present possibility of

584
00:38:52,301 --> 00:38:57,301
apocalypse in your personal life and 
your familiar life and in this broader 

585
00:38:57,301 --> 00:38:58,330
social life,
right?

586
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:03,600
Chaos is the consequence of your finite 
fragility existing in a world that's 

587
00:39:03,821 --> 00:39:06,850
beyond you.
Chaos is potential.

588
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:12,120
Chaos is what lies before you.
Chaos is what you can call on when you 

589
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,740
need something to rescue yourself from 
malfunctioning order.

590
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:19,510
It's a permanent element of existence.
Chaos is what you don't know.

591
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:25,650
Chaos is what's outside the fire.
Chaos is what's outside the walls of 

592
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:30,091
your house.
Chaos is what's outside the walls of 

593
00:39:30,091 --> 00:39:32,731
your town.
Chaos is what's outside of the borders 

594
00:39:32,731 --> 00:39:36,211
of your country.
All of that is chaos and potential

595
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:39,020
order

596
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:46,520
order is where you are when what you're 
doing is working in the manner that you 

597
00:39:46,831 --> 00:39:48,870
intended.
Okay?

598
00:39:48,871 --> 00:39:53,871
It's a very specific definition.
How do you know that you know what 

599
00:39:53,871 --> 00:39:53,871
you're doing?
Well,

600
00:39:53,871 --> 00:39:58,371
you don't because you don't know what 
you're doing because you don't know 

601
00:39:58,371 --> 00:40:00,831
everything.
Everything you do is bounded by 

602
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:03,051
ignorance while you still have to 
operate in the world and so what you do 

603
00:40:03,051 --> 00:40:06,861
is you make a finite plans and then you 
execute plans and then you execute 

604
00:40:07,231 --> 00:40:11,640
strategies to make those plans manifest 
themselves,

605
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:15,230
and if the plan's manifest themselves 
the way that you desired,

606
00:40:15,231 --> 00:40:17,760
then you regard your knowledge as 
sufficient.

607
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:23,540
That's your definition of truth and it's
the only definition of truth that you 

608
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:26,100
can use because you don't have 
everything at hand and when you're aware

609
00:40:26,101 --> 00:40:30,210
what you're doing is working that's 
order and you might think,

610
00:40:30,211 --> 00:40:35,211
well,
I should just stay there because that's 

611
00:40:35,211 --> 00:40:37,701
a comfortable place to be and there's a 
certain amount of truth to that except 

612
00:40:37,701 --> 00:40:39,880
for one thing.
If you've

613
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:48,290
defined a domain of order and you stand 
in it and you wait,

614
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:54,080
the disorder will enter all by itself 
because things aren't static.

615
00:40:54,081 --> 00:40:59,081
Things change all the time and your 
attempt to bind yourself within a static

616
00:40:59,241 --> 00:41:04,241
structure is destined to fail because 
everything around you is in flux and the

617
00:41:05,391 --> 00:41:09,800
thing that you parceled out as permanent
will transform itself across time.

618
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:15,220
Here's an example.
Let's say you're a perfectly well 

619
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:17,600
adapted 11 year old and it's actually 
possible to meet an 11 year old.

620
00:41:17,601 --> 00:41:20,480
Children are often very delightful 
because they're like adult children.

621
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,920
They're not teenagers.
They're like as they're.

622
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:28,790
They're the most mature form of children
and they can be really delightful people

623
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:33,940
and then like three years later you hate
them and and the reason for that is that

624
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:36,470
of course,
as soon as they hit puberty,

625
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:39,410
which is the emergence of chaos into 
the,

626
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,230
into the already developed childhood 
structure,

627
00:41:42,231 --> 00:41:47,231
it's really the emergence of sexuality 
into a structure that didn't have to 

628
00:41:47,231 --> 00:41:49,400
adapt to sexuality and maybe even the 
emergence of aggression to some degree,

629
00:41:49,401 --> 00:41:50,630
but mostly sexuality.

630
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:56,080
If the child maintains only the 11 year 
old personality by the time they're 16,

631
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:59,270
they're no longer a delightful 11 year 
old.

632
00:41:59,271 --> 00:42:03,200
There are very immature 16 year old and 
the reason that I'm pointing that out is

633
00:42:03,201 --> 00:42:08,201
because just because something works for
you now doesn't mean it's going to work 

634
00:42:08,201 --> 00:42:11,240
for you five years from now and so in 
order to remain stable,

635
00:42:11,241 --> 00:42:14,180
you can't be stagnant.
They're not the same thing.

636
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:19,220
Stability is a dynamic,
not a not something static,

637
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:22,070
and so not only do you have to be where 
you are,

638
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:27,340
but you have to be going to where you're
going and you have to be participating 

639
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:30,731
in both of those things actively.
So it's stability plus transformation 

640
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,200
and and I would say that manifests 
itself.

641
00:42:33,201 --> 00:42:36,800
You know when you're there because that 
manifests itself as meaningful.

642
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,290
That's actually the.
The instinct of meaning,

643
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:44,440
which is an instinct and perhaps the 
deepest instinct is precisely the 

644
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,940
instinct that tells you when where you 
are as sufficiently stable,

645
00:42:46,941 --> 00:42:51,941
but you're transforming yourself at a 
sufficient rate to keep up with 

646
00:42:51,941 --> 00:42:52,130
everything that's changing.

647
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:54,680
And you know that because if you're at 
your job,

648
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:57,110
you might say to yourself,
well,

649
00:42:57,111 --> 00:43:02,111
my job is really secure,
but it's not very challenging and you 

650
00:43:02,111 --> 00:43:03,050
think,
well why do you care about that?

651
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:06,440
It's very secure and answer to that is,
well,

652
00:43:06,441 --> 00:43:09,350
if it's not challenging,
it's deadening in a sense,

653
00:43:09,351 --> 00:43:10,910
right?
The spirit goes out of it.

654
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:13,700
If it's not challenging,
you need to be challenged.

655
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,560
And why is that?
Well,

656
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:20,610
the answer is well,
tomorrow is coming and whoever you are 

657
00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:24,011
now isn't enough for tomorrow.
And so today you also have to be 

658
00:43:24,011 --> 00:43:25,640
preparing for tomorrow and next week and
next year.

659
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:29,360
And if your job isn't challenging than 
it isn't doing that for you,

660
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:31,700
and you find it deadening,
not meaningful.

661
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:36,880
And the reason for that is that it 
violates your most essential instinct 

662
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,440
and your most essential instinct is the 
instinct for meaning.

663
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:41,330
And it signifies that.

664
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:46,600
It actually signifies that you have the 
balance between chaos and order right 

665
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:47,330
deeply,
right?

666
00:43:47,810 --> 00:43:52,810
Which is why it's the most fundamental 
of instincts because chaos in order are 

667
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:54,810
the most real of things.
Alright?

668
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:57,380
So you have the chaos that surrounds 
you.

669
00:43:57,381 --> 00:44:00,200
And in some some sense,
infinite in scope,

670
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:03,230
and then you have the order that you 
produce,

671
00:44:03,231 --> 00:44:06,080
which is your mastery of it.
Well,

672
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:11,260
let's take order a part for a minute.
We want to think about the structure of 

673
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:14,561
order and bill.
And I'm not saying that chaos is bad in 

674
00:44:14,561 --> 00:44:15,890
order is good.
I'm not saying that at all.

675
00:44:15,891 --> 00:44:18,490
That's not the right way to look at it.
It's the balance.

676
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:21,350
It's the balance between them that's of 
crucial importance.

677
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:24,290
They just,
they exist as superordinate categories.

678
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:27,290
Whether you liked them or not is really 
not that relevant.

679
00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:28,850
They're,
they're,

680
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:33,920
they're,
they're the fundamental constituent 

681
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:33,920
elements of reality.

682
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:33,930
Um,
you might say,

683
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,520
well,
what's your evidence for that?

684
00:44:35,521 --> 00:44:40,521
And I can tell you one piece of evidence
which I won't go into for for very much 

685
00:44:40,521 --> 00:44:42,270
time.
You have two hemispheres.

686
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:48,210
And each in your brain,
your brain is composed of two 

687
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:48,630
hemispheres,
which implies something about the nature

688
00:44:48,631 --> 00:44:53,631
of the world.
Given that your brain is hypothetically 

689
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:56,811
adapted to the structure of the world.
It's not just your brain because animal 

690
00:44:56,811 --> 00:44:58,290
brains have the same fundamental 
structure,

691
00:44:58,291 --> 00:45:03,291
this bifurcated structure.
And the bifurcation indicates that 

692
00:45:03,291 --> 00:45:07,281
there's two fundamental realities 
because otherwise why would you need a 

693
00:45:07,281 --> 00:45:11,061
bifurcated structure or maybe you needed
try you brain or one that's divided into

694
00:45:11,071 --> 00:45:12,750
four,
but that isn't what you have.

695
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:17,960
You have one that's divided into two and
if your working definition of reality is

696
00:45:18,181 --> 00:45:20,130
scientific,
biological,

697
00:45:20,131 --> 00:45:25,131
let's say,
then your definition of reality is 

698
00:45:25,131 --> 00:45:25,650
reality is that which shapes life.

699
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,820
You can't actually do better than that 
from a Darwinian perspective.

700
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:35,240
And if the reality that shaped life 
produced a bifurcated representational 

701
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:37,980
structure,
then that implies that the proper way to

702
00:45:37,981 --> 00:45:42,981
represent reality and perhaps that 
reality itself is in fact bifurcated.

703
00:45:43,231 --> 00:45:48,231
And I believe it's bifurcated in the 
manner I just described and the 

704
00:45:48,231 --> 00:45:50,250
neurological evidence for that is 
actually quite overwhelming.

705
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,920
It's come from multiple sources,
some of them Russian,

706
00:45:52,921 --> 00:45:57,921
some of them American.
That's where most of the work has been 

707
00:45:57,921 --> 00:46:00,801
done.
Your left hemisphere is specialized for 

708
00:46:00,801 --> 00:46:02,490
operation in those situations that you 
know and understand,

709
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:07,670
and your right hemisphere is specialized
for operation in those situations that 

710
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:11,661
you neither know nor understand.
And the proper way to Orient Yourself in

711
00:46:12,661 --> 00:46:16,080
life is to get the balance between those
two sets of operations.

712
00:46:16,290 --> 00:46:21,290
Correct.
And the way that manifests itself in 

713
00:46:21,290 --> 00:46:23,160
your subjective experiences as 
meaningful engagement.

714
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:29,480
And so that's not a bad first pass.
What would you say?

715
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:35,270
Justification for the view that these 
two domains are the most real domains.

716
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:39,270
Okay,
so order.

717
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:42,240
What is order?
Well,

718
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:46,560
if you just sit there and do nothing,
that will be chaos.

719
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,150
Why?
Well,

720
00:46:48,151 --> 00:46:50,070
because you'll.
You'll suffer and die.

721
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:54,840
That's what will happen.
So without action on your part,

722
00:46:55,590 --> 00:46:59,010
deterioration in death is a certainty.
Okay?

723
00:46:59,011 --> 00:47:04,011
So you need to act.
While then we built on an action 

724
00:47:04,011 --> 00:47:05,130
platform being where the consequences of

725
00:47:09,490 --> 00:47:14,490
3 billion years of evolution for action,
action,

726
00:47:14,681 --> 00:47:19,681
movement forward in the face of 
necessity is the prime dictum of life.

727
00:47:20,230 --> 00:47:23,500
That's a good way of thinking about it.
Were embodied action.

728
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:27,610
What do you have to do when you act?
Well,

729
00:47:27,850 --> 00:47:30,520
at minimum you have to do,
keeps you able to act.

730
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:32,110
These are truisms,
right?

731
00:47:32,111 --> 00:47:33,970
I mean,
you have to have something to eat.

732
00:47:33,971 --> 00:47:37,000
You have to have some fresh water.
You need some shelter,

733
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:41,230
right?
You need some companionship.

734
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:45,100
You need a sexual partner,
you need children.

735
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:48,220
You need play.
You need to be touched.

736
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:49,400
There's,
there's an.

737
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:52,030
I mean,
I actually mean need by the way.

738
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:56,350
People deprived of play go insane.
People who aren't touched,

739
00:47:56,530 --> 00:47:58,930
die.
These things are necessary.

740
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:03,960
Well,
assuming that survival itself is 

741
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:03,960
necessary,
but we'll start with that.

742
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:08,010
We'll start with the assumption that 
just sitting there and suffering and 

743
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,520
dying is not the right solution.

744
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,190
Okay,
so you have to act in the world.

745
00:48:12,610 --> 00:48:17,350
You have to act in the world that in a 
manner that stops you from deteriorating

746
00:48:17,351 --> 00:48:22,351
and dying at minimum,
and that means that you have to address 

747
00:48:22,351 --> 00:48:24,700
the problems that are intrinsic to that 
destiny.

748
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:27,550
Now you have all sorts of systems that 
evolved,

749
00:48:27,790 --> 00:48:32,790
have evolved to help you do that.
Motivational systems we have to eat so 

750
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:35,170
you get hungry.
You have to find water and consume it so

751
00:48:35,171 --> 00:48:37,120
you get thirsty,
you get lonely,

752
00:48:37,390 --> 00:48:38,550
you get curious.
There's,

753
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:43,700
there's,
there's specialized biological systems 

754
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:43,700
that are very,
very old.

755
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:44,830
You get aggressive,
you get afraid.

756
00:48:45,010 --> 00:48:48,730
You suffer pain.
All those specialized systems for all of

757
00:48:48,731 --> 00:48:53,731
those unit directional systems of 
orientation in the world and they help 

758
00:48:53,731 --> 00:48:55,210
you figure out what to do so when you're
hungry,

759
00:48:55,211 --> 00:49:00,211
it's time to eat and when you're thirsty
it's it's time to drink and when your 

760
00:49:00,211 --> 00:49:00,940
lonesome,
it's time to seek out some companionship

761
00:49:00,941 --> 00:49:04,390
and you have specialized systems that 
help you do that,

762
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:07,360
but they're not enough because,
well,

763
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:08,290
they're not very bright.

764
00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:13,290
That's one way of looking at it.
They're kind of uni dimensional and you 

765
00:49:13,290 --> 00:49:13,290
also have the problem of organizing all 
of them.

766
00:49:13,290 --> 00:49:13,720
It's like,
well,

767
00:49:13,721 --> 00:49:18,721
you have to eat now and you have to 
drink now and you need a companion and 

768
00:49:18,721 --> 00:49:22,170
it's probably time to play and you have 
to do something about shelter and there 

769
00:49:22,170 --> 00:49:25,531
isn't just you right now.
There's you now and tomorrow and next 

770
00:49:25,531 --> 00:49:26,260
week and a year from now and five years 
from now.

771
00:49:26,261 --> 00:49:31,261
So you have to plan across all those 
stretches of time and there isn't just 

772
00:49:31,261 --> 00:49:32,020
you now in the future.
You,

773
00:49:32,021 --> 00:49:37,021
there's you plus your family and your 
community and so all of that has to be 

774
00:49:37,021 --> 00:49:40,690
taken into account while you're plotting
your movement forward is very,

775
00:49:40,691 --> 00:49:45,691
very complicated.
You have all these problems to solve 

776
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:46,090
simultaneously and your motivational 
systems,

777
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:51,120
anger,
hunger and so forth can help you solve 

778
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:53,410
one of those problems now,
but not all of them permanently.

779
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:58,590
That requires higher cognitive function 
and that's part of what drove the 

780
00:49:58,590 --> 00:50:00,670
evolution of our complex cognitive 
systems.

781
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:04,690
That's how do you propagate the game 
across time in a complex environment,

782
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:09,170
the left hemisphere operates when,
where,

783
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:14,220
when what you're doing works and so a 
lot of what you do during your life is 

784
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:19,081
to keep your right hemisphere off.
People don't like it going on 

785
00:50:19,091 --> 00:50:21,520
accidentally.
It's the home of negative emotion.

786
00:50:21,521 --> 00:50:26,290
It's the home of pain and anxiety.
It's the thing that turns on and freezes

787
00:50:26,291 --> 00:50:30,830
you in your tracks when something that 
you deeply did not expect happens and it

788
00:50:30,831 --> 00:50:33,980
prepares you to deal with the onslaught 
of what you didn't expect.

789
00:50:35,090 --> 00:50:38,480
Now,
it's not all bad news because to use the

790
00:50:38,481 --> 00:50:43,481
right hemisphere in a judicious manner 
is also something that adds intrigue and

791
00:50:43,491 --> 00:50:47,750
interest in artistic expression and all 
sorts of positive things to your life,

792
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:51,440
so because potential is not only 
negative,

793
00:50:51,441 --> 00:50:52,490
it's also positive.

794
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:57,700
It can be,
it can be dealt with in ways that are 

795
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:00,890
deeply enriching and meaningful order.
Okay,

796
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:05,570
so you have to do something.
Otherwise the consequences are dire.

797
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,930
To do something you have to value 
something.

798
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:14,340
It's a definitional issue because to do 
something is to act out the proposition 

799
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:17,930
that the thing you're doing,
the thing you're aiming at,

800
00:51:17,931 --> 00:51:22,931
let's say is preferable to the thing you
have and preferable means you'll do it 

801
00:51:22,931 --> 00:51:24,260
so those things are tied together so 
tightly.

802
00:51:24,261 --> 00:51:27,470
You can't disentangle them.
If you say,

803
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:30,710
I'm aiming at x,
but I don't value it,

804
00:51:31,010 --> 00:51:36,010
then there's something wrong with the 
way that you're conceptualizing the 

805
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:38,921
statement because to aim at something 
and to work to bring it into existence 

806
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:41,690
is the same as valuing it.
And if you say,

807
00:51:41,691 --> 00:51:42,710
well,
I don't value it,

808
00:51:42,711 --> 00:51:47,711
then something's out of kilter.
Either you're acting out a falsehood or 

809
00:51:47,711 --> 00:51:48,680
you don't know what you're talking 
about.

810
00:51:48,830 --> 00:51:53,830
It's one of those two things and you 
meet people like that are deeply 

811
00:51:53,830 --> 00:51:56,801
confused there.
Their action patterns and their verbal 

812
00:51:56,801 --> 00:52:00,971
self representation don't Mesh,
but that doesn't mean that they're 

813
00:52:00,971 --> 00:52:05,950
critics of value.
It just means that they're deeply 

814
00:52:05,950 --> 00:52:07,700
confused,
so you have to act or you suffer.

815
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:12,730
In order to act,
you have to have a value structure 

816
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:13,370
because to act you have to value one 
thing more than another,

817
00:52:13,490 --> 00:52:17,180
which means that you have to inhabit a 
structure of value.

818
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:19,840
You have to,
okay,

819
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:25,510
so you need a structure value because 
it's the antidote to catastrophe.

820
00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:31,990
Now,
if you act out a structure of values 

821
00:52:31,990 --> 00:52:32,990
socially,
which you will because you're social,

822
00:52:33,230 --> 00:52:37,280
you're not going to pursue your aims in 
isolation because you're not.

823
00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:41,990
You're not a solitary animal.
You're a social animal,

824
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:45,590
you're a tribal animal.
Deeply tribal.

825
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:48,290
We live in groups.
We live in families,

826
00:52:48,291 --> 00:52:49,370
we live in communities.

827
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:54,520
We live in large societies were social 
at every level of analysis and we've 

828
00:52:54,801 --> 00:52:58,970
been social for as long as we've been 
primates,

829
00:52:59,570 --> 00:53:04,570
so maybe that's.
That's at least 6 million years and it 

830
00:53:04,570 --> 00:53:07,490
might be more like 60 million years.
It's really a long time,

831
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:11,180
so it's not an arbitrary social 
construction.

832
00:53:11,630 --> 00:53:13,280
It's far,
far deeper than that.

833
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Now what happens when you act out a 
structure of value in a social 

834
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,571
environment,
you produce a hierarchy inevitably.

835
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:24,830
Well,
let's think it through.

836
00:53:25,050 --> 00:53:26,730
Why?
Well,

837
00:53:26,731 --> 00:53:30,450
let's say that you say that one thing is
more worth doing than another,

838
00:53:31,110 --> 00:53:36,110
whatever it happens to me,
and then you tell a bunch of people 

839
00:53:36,110 --> 00:53:39,231
about what you're doing and they decide 
that they're going to come along and 

840
00:53:39,231 --> 00:53:41,631
help you do this thing that's valuable 
because they also think it's valuable 

841
00:53:41,631 --> 00:53:43,440
and maybe you get 20 people together to 
do this thing.

842
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:46,830
Whatever it happens to me,
and the first thing you discover is that

843
00:53:46,831 --> 00:53:51,831
some of the people are way better at 
doing whatever it is that they're doing 

844
00:53:51,831 --> 00:53:51,831
than other people.

845
00:53:51,831 --> 00:53:56,660
So and that.
And who knows why that is because it 

846
00:53:56,660 --> 00:53:56,660
depends on what you chose to do,
you know,

847
00:53:56,660 --> 00:54:01,371
if you chose a then it would be a 
different group of people who were good 

848
00:54:01,371 --> 00:54:01,890
at it.
Then if you chose B,

849
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:03,750
because people differ in their 
abilities.

850
00:54:03,751 --> 00:54:08,751
But one thing you will not escape from 
if you make an organization to do 

851
00:54:08,751 --> 00:54:13,161
something valuable is the brute fact 
that it will be a minority of the people

852
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,950
who are good at doing it.
And there's actually a law,

853
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:20,460
it's called price's law and it's a real 
law.

854
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:25,920
Even governs the size of cities and the 
massive stars in the heights of plants 

855
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:31,221
in the jungle.
It just doesn't govern human 

856
00:54:31,221 --> 00:54:33,741
interactions.
And price's law says that the square 

857
00:54:33,741 --> 00:54:34,350
root of the number of people engaged in 
an enterprise.

858
00:54:34,351 --> 00:54:39,351
We'll do half the work.
So if you have 10 people doing 

859
00:54:39,351 --> 00:54:39,810
something,
three of them will do half the work.

860
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:41,760
But if you have 100 people doing 
something,

861
00:54:41,761 --> 00:54:45,540
then 10 of them will do half the work.
And if you have 10,000

862
00:54:45,541 --> 00:54:48,690
people doing something than 100 of them 
will do half the work.

863
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:54,560
And the.
You know how wealth distributes itself 

864
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:55,590
such that a minority of people have most
of the money.

865
00:54:56,040 --> 00:55:00,000
Twelve 85 richest people in the world 
have as much money as the bottom two and

866
00:55:00,001 --> 00:55:01,980
a half billion.
It's something like that.

867
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,720
And everybody goes,
oh my God,

868
00:55:03,870 --> 00:55:05,700
the one percent.
It's like,

869
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:06,570
well,
first of all,

870
00:55:06,571 --> 00:55:10,140
you're all the one percent,
so get over yourself because you're,

871
00:55:10,310 --> 00:55:12,390
you know,
western European,

872
00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:17,070
roughly speaking and by world current 
world standards,

873
00:55:17,071 --> 00:55:22,071
and certainly by historical standards,
you're all well ensconced in the one 

874
00:55:22,071 --> 00:55:23,280
percent.
So if that's a problem,

875
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:27,540
well it's a problem for all of you and 
some of you might be,

876
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:29,220
you know,
richer than that,

877
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:32,160
but that doesn't mean all of you aren't 
in the same boat.

878
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:37,280
Fundamentally,
the fact that wealth aggregates in the 

879
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:40,761
hands of a small number of people is 
part of the general expression of 

880
00:55:40,761 --> 00:55:45,021
price's law.
There's nothing special about the 

881
00:55:45,021 --> 00:55:45,750
distribution of money.
You see the same thing in every creative

882
00:55:45,751 --> 00:55:50,751
domain mean how many of you have have 
recorded a gold record?

883
00:55:53,610 --> 00:55:58,110
How many looks like zero up?
There's one,

884
00:55:58,200 --> 00:55:59,550
one person,
okay,

885
00:55:59,551 --> 00:56:02,710
there's 850 people in here.
So there's one in a thousand.

886
00:56:02,711 --> 00:56:05,070
So that's one 10th of one percent.
Something like that.

887
00:56:05,370 --> 00:56:07,890
How many of you have written a piano 
concerto?

888
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:14,910
How bout painted a painting that's 
hanging in a national museum?

889
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:17,760
Oh look,
it's none of you again.

890
00:56:18,270 --> 00:56:19,200
Right?
Well,

891
00:56:19,201 --> 00:56:22,410
and how many of you have been a member 
of a professional sports team?

892
00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:25,880
Okay,
look up one one.

893
00:56:25,881 --> 00:56:28,670
So that's one in a thousand.
Well you get the point here.

894
00:56:28,810 --> 00:56:29,870
Well if there was a couple,
there was.

895
00:56:29,930 --> 00:56:34,930
Okay.
So it looks like it's easier to be a 

896
00:56:34,930 --> 00:56:37,391
member of a professional sports team or 
my or my audiences is biased.

897
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:41,540
The sample is biased but.
But it is the case.

898
00:56:41,541 --> 00:56:43,880
If you look at high levels of creative 
achievement,

899
00:56:43,881 --> 00:56:48,440
of the sword I've just described,
they characterize it staggering minority

900
00:56:48,441 --> 00:56:53,030
of people.
And so the rule is is that you produce a

901
00:56:53,031 --> 00:56:58,031
value system which you better produce 
because otherwise you suffer and die and

902
00:56:58,101 --> 00:56:59,450
it isn't only that,
only that.

903
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:00,500
It's like,
look,

904
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:03,320
here's something else you all know.
As far as I can tell,

905
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:10,740
we start with the idea that there's an 
intrinsic chaotic element to life and 

906
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:15,061
that includes the inevitability of 
suffering and malevolence betrayal at 

907
00:57:15,221 --> 00:57:20,221
the hands of yourself and other people,
so that's the baseline and that's 

908
00:57:20,221 --> 00:57:23,020
intolerable in many ways because life is
in many ways intolerable.

909
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:24,250
And the question is,
well,

910
00:57:24,251 --> 00:57:26,500
what do you do in the face of something 
that's intolerable?

911
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:29,290
And the answer is when you try to find 
something that justifies it,

912
00:57:29,291 --> 00:57:31,960
right,
you want to have something that gets you

913
00:57:31,961 --> 00:57:36,961
the hell out of bed in the morning and 
not just any old morning but a morning 

914
00:57:36,961 --> 00:57:41,521
when your father has Alzheimer's disease
and your daughter has an incurable 

915
00:57:41,521 --> 00:57:45,781
illness because you need something to 
get out of bed for in those mornings 

916
00:57:45,781 --> 00:57:49,291
too,
and that better be the purpose that you 

917
00:57:49,291 --> 00:57:52,201
found in life.
And if the purpose is going to be such 

918
00:57:52,201 --> 00:57:52,330
that it gets you out of bed in the 
mornings,

919
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:57,310
it better be a pretty damn noble purpose
because otherwise why would you bother?

920
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,860
And so not only do you need a value 
structure,

921
00:57:59,861 --> 00:58:03,730
you need one that's of sufficient 
tension,

922
00:58:03,731 --> 00:58:08,731
let's say,
or sufficient value or sufficient 

923
00:58:08,731 --> 00:58:11,851
nobility so that it's worth suffering 
for because you're going to suffer and 

924
00:58:12,251 --> 00:58:15,220
you better have something that makes the
suffering justifiable,

925
00:58:15,550 --> 00:58:20,550
and so not only do you need the value 
structure so that you don't just 

926
00:58:20,550 --> 00:58:23,851
deteriorate and die.
You need the value structure so that 

927
00:58:23,851 --> 00:58:25,240
when the flood comes in your life as it 
certainly will,

928
00:58:25,450 --> 00:58:29,350
that you have built a vessel that will 
sustain you through the catastrophe.

929
00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:33,100
And that's not this pursuit of 
happiness.

930
00:58:33,490 --> 00:58:36,670
It's not even the pursuit of security.
It's none of that.

931
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:42,150
It's your the orientation that you've 
managed to produce in your own life 

932
00:58:42,150 --> 00:58:47,040
towards our higher good that's so high 
that it's worth bearing the burden of 

933
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:47,950
being to produce.

934
00:58:49,510 --> 00:58:51,790
You implement that in the world.
You produce a hierarchy.

935
00:58:52,810 --> 00:58:53,920
Now you might say,
well,

936
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:59,840
and then you have the problem of 
hierarchy and the problem of hierarchy 

937
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:02,641
is a very few people are going to be 
very good at whatever that hierarchy 

938
00:59:02,641 --> 00:59:06,151
does.
And then you have the second problem 

939
00:59:06,151 --> 00:59:08,820
with hierarchy,
which is the problem I just laid out 

940
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:10,921
when I asked you about your spectacular 
levels of attainment and found out that 

941
00:59:10,921 --> 00:59:13,840
they were very.
It was very unlikely.

942
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:16,450
I'm not saying that you haven't attained
worthwhile things.

943
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:18,420
That's not my point.
My point is,

944
00:59:18,421 --> 00:59:23,421
is that very high levels of attainment 
or rare and that's an inevitability.

945
00:59:24,141 --> 00:59:29,141
As soon as you decide that something's 
worth doing to inevitabilities people 

946
00:59:29,141 --> 00:59:33,110
stack up at the top minority of people 
stack up at the top and take most of the

947
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:38,140
proceeds,
whatever they happen to be or deserve 

948
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:38,140
them or earn them,
whatever,

949
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:42,400
however,
I don't care how you conceptualize it 

950
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:42,400
and almost everybody else stacks up at 
the bottom.

951
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:46,340
And so the problem with hierarchies is 
that even though they're necessary,

952
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:50,000
they tend to produce a situation where 
most people stack up at the bottom.

953
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:53,660
And so that's the next thing that we 
have to contend with.

954
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:58,900
You can't get rid of the hierarchies 
because if you get rid of the 

955
00:59:58,900 --> 00:59:58,900
hierarchies,
there's no value structure.

956
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:01,910
And if there's no value structure,
not only do you deteriorate and die,

957
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:06,740
you want to deteriorate and die,
and that's not a good solution.

958
01:00:07,010 --> 01:00:12,010
But if you do generate a hierarchy,
then you have the problem of the 

959
01:00:12,010 --> 01:00:13,580
hierarchy.
And the problem of the hierarchy is that

960
01:00:13,581 --> 01:00:18,581
it will dispossess most people now,
to the degree that the postmodernists 

961
01:00:18,581 --> 01:00:21,980
have something to say,
that's what they say is hierarchies,

962
01:00:21,981 --> 01:00:23,630
dispossessed,
okay.

963
01:00:23,631 --> 01:00:26,630
And then we can look at that clearly and
carefully,

964
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:32,020
and we can say that doesn't mean a,
that hierarchies themselves are corrupt 

965
01:00:32,751 --> 01:00:34,610
or that we can dispense with them.

966
01:00:35,930 --> 01:00:39,500
But it also doesn't mean that we have no
moral obligation to the dispossessed.

967
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:40,760
And we say,
well,

968
01:00:40,761 --> 01:00:44,480
how do we deal with that politically,
conceptually?

969
01:00:44,570 --> 01:00:46,370
And the way we deal with that,
at least in part,

970
01:00:46,371 --> 01:00:50,120
is to produce a political spectrum that 
ranges from left to right.

971
01:00:50,510 --> 01:00:53,360
The deals with hierarchy and the 
problems that hierarchies caused.

972
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:58,540
So one of the things that you can 
reliably assume about someone who's on 

973
01:00:58,540 --> 01:01:03,191
the right is that they will be 
patriotically in favor of the current 

974
01:01:04,011 --> 01:01:09,011
hierarchy or even more abstractly,
they're in favor of the idea of 

975
01:01:09,011 --> 01:01:11,870
hierarchy itself and you say,
well,

976
01:01:11,871 --> 01:01:16,871
more power to the people on the right 
because you need hierarchies so they 

977
01:01:17,091 --> 01:01:22,091
should support them.
But then you have to take the people on 

978
01:01:22,091 --> 01:01:22,091
the left who say,
yeah,

979
01:01:22,091 --> 01:01:24,020
but what about the people who are 
dispossessed by the hierarchy?

980
01:01:24,350 --> 01:01:26,570
And what you have to say to them is,
yeah,

981
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:28,910
we actually have to do something about 
that,

982
01:01:29,270 --> 01:01:31,400
and you think,
well how do we do something about that?

983
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:36,400
And the answer is we don't actually know
because there's no permanent solution to

984
01:01:36,561 --> 01:01:39,320
the problem of dispossession by the 
hierarchy.

985
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:43,070
We don't know how to fix it.
Say,

986
01:01:43,071 --> 01:01:44,410
well,
we could flatten hierarchies.

987
01:01:44,420 --> 01:01:47,300
It's not without disrupting the value 
structure.

988
01:01:47,990 --> 01:01:50,420
That's a price you don't want to pay.
Well,

989
01:01:50,421 --> 01:01:52,610
we could take from the top and put it at
the bottom.

990
01:01:52,611 --> 01:01:55,760
It's like,
yes,

991
01:01:56,150 --> 01:02:01,150
hypothetically we could.
But it turns out that when you try that 

992
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:02,210
in practice,
it's very,

993
01:02:02,211 --> 01:02:07,211
very easy to rapidly go too far and then
what you end up with not is less 

994
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:13,180
dispossessed.
You end up with no one who has anything,

995
01:02:13,610 --> 01:02:17,540
and that's not a good solution to the 
problem of scarcity,

996
01:02:17,930 --> 01:02:22,930
right?
To make equally dead or equally 

997
01:02:22,930 --> 01:02:27,021
starving,
which is essentially what the communist 

998
01:02:27,021 --> 01:02:29,781
states did across the entirety of the 
20th century is not the proper way to 

999
01:02:30,511 --> 01:02:32,430
address the problem of hierarchy.

1000
01:02:33,210 --> 01:02:35,670
Now it has to be addressed even if 
you're on the right.

1001
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:39,900
Because here's one thing that happens.
Hierarchies tend to Ossify,

1002
01:02:40,170 --> 01:02:45,170
you know,
because what happens is that the people 

1003
01:02:45,170 --> 01:02:45,170
at the top,
maybe they got there by merit,

1004
01:02:45,170 --> 01:02:49,790
but it's easy for them to Gerrymander 
the system so they can stay there 

1005
01:02:49,790 --> 01:02:51,720
without merit.
Or perhaps their children can stay there

1006
01:02:51,721 --> 01:02:56,160
without merit or they can.
Or the hierarchy becomes corrupt so that

1007
01:02:56,161 --> 01:02:59,070
people who only use tyranny and power 
can climate,

1008
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:02,370
and so you don't have a hierarchy of 
competence and value anymore.

1009
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:05,910
You have a hierarchy of brute power,
which looks like a tyranny.

1010
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:11,150
So there's all sorts of ways that 
hierarchies can deteriorate and we have 

1011
01:03:11,150 --> 01:03:12,390
to be awake to ensure that that doesn't 
occur.

1012
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:17,840
Also,
if the hierarchy gets so steep that 

1013
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:19,830
everybody stacks up at zero and no one 
can climate,

1014
01:03:20,190 --> 01:03:25,190
which is basically the definition of a 
malfunctioning tyranny than all the 

1015
01:03:25,190 --> 01:03:26,730
people at the bottom rightly think,
well,

1016
01:03:26,731 --> 01:03:30,720
why don't we just destroyed the game 
because we're already at zero,

1017
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:32,730
so what the hell do we have to lose?

1018
01:03:32,970 --> 01:03:36,720
And so one of the things that you want 
to do if you're a sensible conservative,

1019
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:41,040
is make sure that the hierarchy 
maintains its routing and competence,

1020
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:46,250
that it's transparent and that it's 
climate will because otherwise it will 

1021
01:03:46,471 --> 01:03:50,400
ossify and steepen and then it will 
destroy itself,

1022
01:03:50,550 --> 01:03:54,630
and if you're a conservative and you 
value stability and the hierarchy,

1023
01:03:54,631 --> 01:03:59,631
then you don't want to set up a 
situation where the most likely outcome 

1024
01:03:59,631 --> 01:04:01,620
is that the hierarchy destroys itself.
So,

1025
01:04:02,190 --> 01:04:04,380
so we can be intelligent about this.
We could say,

1026
01:04:04,381 --> 01:04:06,030
look,
don't be thinking.

1027
01:04:06,031 --> 01:04:08,790
You can get rid of hierarchies they've 
been around.

1028
01:04:08,791 --> 01:04:11,400
This is why I wrote chapter one.
I talked about lobsters.

1029
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:17,240
The reason I talked about them is 
because not only is the hierarchical 

1030
01:04:17,821 --> 01:04:21,270
structure itself as a permanent feature 
of existence,

1031
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:26,390
at least a third of a billion years old,
which by the way means that you cannot 

1032
01:04:27,331 --> 01:04:32,331
attribute it to capitalism,
the free market or the corrupt 

1033
01:04:32,331 --> 01:04:36,531
patriarchal west,
unless you're willing to make the case 

1034
01:04:36,531 --> 01:04:39,681
that all three of those elements 
contributed to the existence of 

1035
01:04:39,681 --> 01:04:42,990
dominance hierarchies among crustaceans,
which seems highly unlikely,

1036
01:04:43,350 --> 01:04:45,570
so an and this is actually something 
that's,

1037
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:51,020
that you could think about it as an idea
that's actually directed towards the 

1038
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:51,420
productive left.

1039
01:04:52,110 --> 01:04:57,110
If you want to help the dispossessed,
don't blame the existence of hierarchies

1040
01:04:57,481 --> 01:05:02,481
on capitalism because it's wrong.
It's wrong that the problem is way 

1041
01:05:03,361 --> 01:05:08,361
deeper than that.
And here's something else that's very 

1042
01:05:08,361 --> 01:05:09,210
interesting about capitalism.
A couple of things you might consider,

1043
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:14,750
you know,
we have become spectacularly wealthy 

1044
01:05:14,750 --> 01:05:14,750
since 18,
95,

1045
01:05:14,750 --> 01:05:17,070
right?
First in the West Icelands at classic.

1046
01:05:17,870 --> 01:05:22,870
I mean you guys are so much more wealthy
than you were 100 years ago that it's 

1047
01:05:22,870 --> 01:05:24,850
absolutely impossible to believe.
And so that's first happened in the west

1048
01:05:24,851 --> 01:05:27,970
to exponential economic growth.
Starting in about 1895,

1049
01:05:28,070 --> 01:05:29,260
there's a long tail,
I mean,

1050
01:05:29,261 --> 01:05:34,261
people were improving before that,
but it really kicked in around 1895 and 

1051
01:05:34,261 --> 01:05:36,010
first happened in the west and now it's 
happening everywhere in the world.

1052
01:05:36,190 --> 01:05:37,780
I don't know if you know this,
but you know,

1053
01:05:38,340 --> 01:05:43,340
um,
the eon set a goal in 2000 to have the 

1054
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:45,550
level of absolute poverty in the world 
by 2015,

1055
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,330
which is the fastest rate of economic 
growth ever recorded.

1056
01:05:49,660 --> 01:05:54,040
We attained it in 2012,
three years ahead of the most optimistic

1057
01:05:54,041 --> 01:05:55,810
projections.
Right?

1058
01:05:55,811 --> 01:06:00,811
And so people are being lifted out of 
poverty at a rate that has never been 

1059
01:06:00,811 --> 01:06:04,561
seen in the history of the world.
Hope to the power grids provided with 

1060
01:06:04,561 --> 01:06:08,431
cell phones provided with free,
with access to fresh water provided with

1061
01:06:08,561 --> 01:06:11,350
access to medications that decrease 
child mortality.

1062
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:17,040
If you look at the statistics,
there are so many things getting better 

1063
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:17,970
so fast you cannot even believe it.
And that's,

1064
01:06:18,050 --> 01:06:20,290
and here's,
that's a consequences as far as,

1065
01:06:20,650 --> 01:06:24,760
as far as the data indicate of the 
operation of the free market system,

1066
01:06:24,910 --> 01:06:27,880
which does produce inequality.
That's the thing,

1067
01:06:28,540 --> 01:06:33,540
but as far as I can tell,
the only system that has ever produced 

1068
01:06:33,540 --> 01:06:36,541
wealth and as law or has every system 
produces inequality,

1069
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:40,360
but the only system we know of that 
produces,

1070
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:44,200
produces wealth and inequality is the 
free market.

1071
01:06:45,310 --> 01:06:47,530
So here's a question for everyone left 
and right.

1072
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:51,280
How many units of inequality will you 
tolerate to produce one unit of wealth?

1073
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:56,590
And if the answer is zero,
then you've gone too far.

1074
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:00,130
You're outside the appropriate political
debate.

1075
01:07:00,490 --> 01:07:05,490
That's the wrong answer.
And if you try to impose that all there 

1076
01:07:05,490 --> 01:07:09,511
will be as mayhem because the price we 
pay for wealth is inequality.

1077
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:15,720
Now that doesn't mean that you can let 
inequality run to its ultimate extreme 

1078
01:07:15,730 --> 01:07:17,320
because then you run into the other 
problem,

1079
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:19,960
which is the monopoly problem.
You've all played monopoly.

1080
01:07:19,961 --> 01:07:22,570
I presume what happens in every monopoly
game,

1081
01:07:23,950 --> 01:07:27,280
if you lay it out,
everyone's stacks out at zero,

1082
01:07:27,550 --> 01:07:29,020
zero,
except one person.

1083
01:07:29,230 --> 01:07:34,230
Now if you play at 50 times,
you'll find that it's hardly ever the 

1084
01:07:34,230 --> 01:07:36,130
same person because it's basically a 
game of chance and there's a fair bit of

1085
01:07:36,131 --> 01:07:41,131
chance by the way,
operating in the distribution of money 

1086
01:07:41,131 --> 01:07:41,131
in the world.

1087
01:07:41,131 --> 01:07:41,290
It's not all chance,
but there's a fair bit of chance.

1088
01:07:41,650 --> 01:07:46,650
But the logical conclusion to a 
hierarchy that can play itself out 

1089
01:07:46,650 --> 01:07:50,160
totally is that one person has 
everything and everyone else has 

1090
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:51,640
nothing.
Obviously that's not a useful outcome.

1091
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:54,400
So,
so you know,

1092
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:57,550
and there are ways that we fix that in 
our society.

1093
01:07:59,050 --> 01:08:02,080
We have progressive tax policies and you
can argue about their utility,

1094
01:08:02,081 --> 01:08:06,040
but that's one way of rectifying it 
potentially.

1095
01:08:06,310 --> 01:08:09,340
Another way of rectifying is that we 
don't have one game,

1096
01:08:09,940 --> 01:08:11,560
right?
In a pluralistic society,

1097
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:14,110
we have many,
many games that people can play.

1098
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:16,280
And so if you can't be a successful 
lawyer,

1099
01:08:16,430 --> 01:08:19,370
then maybe you could be a successful 
plumber and if you can't be a successful

1100
01:08:19,371 --> 01:08:24,371
plumber,
maybe you can run a small restaurant or 

1101
01:08:24,371 --> 01:08:24,371
you know,
there's a diversity of games.

1102
01:08:24,371 --> 01:08:27,050
And so that's a good way of,
of allowing,

1103
01:08:27,570 --> 01:08:30,050
of increasing the robustness of the 
system.

1104
01:08:30,050 --> 01:08:35,050
So that you don't get hierarchies that 
are so steep that they collapsed in an 

1105
01:08:35,050 --> 01:08:38,430
in it upon themselves.
And so those are sophisticated 

1106
01:08:38,430 --> 01:08:39,740
approaches.
Perhaps there are other approaches to,

1107
01:08:39,741 --> 01:08:42,650
but it's an intractable problem.
It says in the New Testament,

1108
01:08:42,890 --> 01:08:47,890
it's one of the things you'd swear would
be edited out because it's such a harsh 

1109
01:08:47,890 --> 01:08:49,430
statement.
The poor will be with us always.

1110
01:08:50,030 --> 01:08:51,290
Well,
what's that in reference to?

1111
01:08:51,291 --> 01:08:53,570
It's also in reference to the matthew 
principle,

1112
01:08:53,690 --> 01:08:58,690
which is another new testament statement
and happens to be an economic axiom to 

1113
01:08:59,061 --> 01:09:02,630
those who have everything more will be 
given from those who have nothing.

1114
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:07,720
Everything will be taken.
That's the structure of the world and 

1115
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:08,600
you can't lay it at the feet of the 
West.

1116
01:09:08,780 --> 01:09:13,780
It's the structure of the world.
Now that means we have to contend with 

1117
01:09:13,780 --> 01:09:15,950
it and it's not an easy thing to contend
with and part of the reason that we have

1118
01:09:15,951 --> 01:09:20,951
a continual political dialogue and that 
we need to have a continual political 

1119
01:09:20,951 --> 01:09:25,421
dialogue is to make sure that our 
hierarchies exist and remain intact,

1120
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:30,760
but don't become so steep and corrupt 
that they destroy themselves and you 

1121
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:35,021
need a left and a right for that and if 
and but that means the left half has to 

1122
01:09:35,021 --> 01:09:39,821
admit that hierarchies are not only 
necessary but valuable and the right has

1123
01:09:39,861 --> 01:09:42,860
to admit that despite their necessity 
and value,

1124
01:09:43,010 --> 01:09:48,010
they tend to stack people up at the 
bottom and that actually constitutes a 

1125
01:09:48,010 --> 01:09:48,010
continual problem.

1126
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:49,430
You see that in.

1127
01:09:52,940 --> 01:09:57,940
You see that in the old testament 
because one of the things that happens 

1128
01:09:57,940 --> 01:10:01,451
in the old testament is Israel struggles
up to state and empire status.

1129
01:10:01,521 --> 01:10:04,190
Six Times its struggles out of the 
chaos,

1130
01:10:04,390 --> 01:10:07,610
up to empire status,
and then it gets corrupt.

1131
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:10,180
It loses the way.
It isn't.

1132
01:10:10,190 --> 01:10:15,190
Balancing things between chaos and order
properly that the kings get arrogant is 

1133
01:10:15,190 --> 01:10:17,690
so to the people and they forget their 
relationship with God.

1134
01:10:17,870 --> 01:10:20,900
That's another way of thinking about it,
and then a profit comes up and says,

1135
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:24,080
you aren't paying enough attention to 
the widows and the orphans.

1136
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:29,320
You better look out because that 
displeases God and the Israelites who 

1137
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:32,480
are stiff necked and arrogant think 
what's God going to do to us,

1138
01:10:32,630 --> 01:10:34,550
which is not a very wise way of 
thinking,

1139
01:10:34,910 --> 01:10:39,910
and so they don't take the steps 
necessary to rectify their deviation 

1140
01:10:39,910 --> 01:10:44,621
from the proper path and they get 
absolutely flattened and the 

1141
01:10:44,621 --> 01:10:48,200
consequences of that last for 
generations like seven generations,

1142
01:10:48,470 --> 01:10:53,470
and then they struggle their way up to 
something approximating empire status 

1143
01:10:53,470 --> 01:10:54,890
again,
and exactly the same thing happens.

1144
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:59,720
They forget and they collapse and 
there's six stories like that in the Old

1145
01:10:59,721 --> 01:11:04,721
Testament.
It's all documented by a man named 

1146
01:11:04,721 --> 01:11:07,241
Northrop Frye who is a Canadian literary
critic who wrote a couple of books on 

1147
01:11:07,241 --> 01:11:11,681
the Bible.
One called the great code and the other 

1148
01:11:11,681 --> 01:11:11,681
called words with power,
which I,

1149
01:11:11,681 --> 01:11:15,240
I would highly recommend.
It's an analysis of the Bible 

1150
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:15,240
literature.
Brilliant.

1151
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:17,040
For those of you who might be interested
in human thinking,

1152
01:11:17,250 --> 01:11:20,280
fries thinking is a nice adjunct.
So.

1153
01:11:20,660 --> 01:11:21,780
All right,
so.

1154
01:11:23,010 --> 01:11:27,450
So that's the nature of the world order 
chaos and order,

1155
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:33,260
and your goal is to keep those,
the relationship between those two 

1156
01:11:33,260 --> 01:11:35,460
things optimized and you do that by 
doing what's meaningful,

1157
01:11:35,461 --> 01:11:40,461
not what's expedient.
That's rule six and you ensure that you 

1158
01:11:40,531 --> 01:11:44,490
have the world construed properly by 
following rule number eight,

1159
01:11:44,491 --> 01:11:47,250
which is tell the truth,
or at least don't lie.

1160
01:11:47,430 --> 01:11:52,430
You don't want to pathologize the 
instinct that orients you in the world 

1161
01:11:52,430 --> 01:11:54,840
and you will pathologize it by engaging 
in habitual deceit.

1162
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:57,780
And the reason you do that is when you 
practice something,

1163
01:11:58,050 --> 01:12:02,520
you build structures that specialize in 
that and then they run automatically.

1164
01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:07,700
So if you're living a lie,
which is a very common thing for people 

1165
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:11,001
to do,
then you're building neurological 

1166
01:12:11,001 --> 01:12:11,001
mechanisms that view the world through 
that lie.

1167
01:12:11,001 --> 01:12:15,320
And once they're built,
they're you and good luck unbuilding 

1168
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:15,420
them.
It's very,

1169
01:12:15,421 --> 01:12:20,421
very difficult.
That's in part what happens to people 

1170
01:12:20,421 --> 01:12:22,821
who are addicted by the way they build 
mechanisms of search neurological 

1171
01:12:23,371 --> 01:12:27,810
structures that are focused on the drug 
and those systems are alive and all they

1172
01:12:27,811 --> 01:12:31,800
want is the drug and they're not.
It's not psychological.

1173
01:12:31,801 --> 01:12:36,801
Exactly.
It's psychophysiological don't build 

1174
01:12:36,801 --> 01:12:40,380
structures of cognition predicated on 
deception because you will pay for it,

1175
01:12:40,770 --> 01:12:45,770
and so if you're going to guide your 
life with the orientation of the 

1176
01:12:45,770 --> 01:12:49,101
instinct of meaning,
then you have to be very careful with 

1177
01:12:49,101 --> 01:12:51,801
what you say and write and think because
every time you say or write or think 

1178
01:12:51,901 --> 01:12:56,901
something,
you build a little neurological 

1179
01:12:56,901 --> 01:12:58,791
structure that's specialized for that 
and it participates in this parsing of 

1180
01:12:58,791 --> 01:13:00,750
the world.
So all right,

1181
01:13:07,420 --> 01:13:12,420
chaos and order.
Then you can say the order orders a 

1182
01:13:12,420 --> 01:13:12,420
hierarchy.
Okay,

1183
01:13:12,420 --> 01:13:17,340
so here's the next question.
Next two questions is order a hierarchy

1184
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:25,150
and then a subsidiary question would be,
if order is a hierarchy,

1185
01:13:25,420 --> 01:13:30,420
what's what either what is at the top of
the hierarchy or what should be at the 

1186
01:13:30,611 --> 01:13:33,520
top of the hierarchy instead of 
hierarchies of structure.

1187
01:13:33,521 --> 01:13:36,490
Value.
So that's the question is what should be

1188
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:39,640
of ultimate value.
Okay,

1189
01:13:39,670 --> 01:13:41,650
so now we're going to take that apart a 
little bit.

1190
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:46,000
The first thing I would say his order is
not an hierarchy.

1191
01:13:47,430 --> 01:13:51,640
Order is a set of hierarchies.
That's a different thing.

1192
01:13:52,390 --> 01:13:56,290
So I'll,
I'll tell you how to think about that.

1193
01:13:56,291 --> 01:14:00,730
I think so.
Now imagine you have a child and they're

1194
01:14:00,731 --> 01:14:05,731
playing soccer and uh,
your child is a pretty good soccer 

1195
01:14:05,731 --> 01:14:05,731
player.

1196
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:08,220
No,
I'll tell you a different story.

1197
01:14:09,390 --> 01:14:14,390
This actually happened.
So I'm going to tell you a story about 

1198
01:14:14,390 --> 01:14:16,690
hockey and I'm since I'm Canadian.
What the hell?

1199
01:14:16,691 --> 01:14:18,130
I might as well tell you a story about 
hockey.

1200
01:14:19,870 --> 01:14:22,030
My son played hockey.
He still plays hockey.

1201
01:14:22,270 --> 01:14:27,270
He's a pretty good hockey player and my 
wife and I used to go watch him play 

1202
01:14:27,311 --> 01:14:32,311
hockey.
There was an arena just down the street 

1203
01:14:32,311 --> 01:14:32,620
from us and there was a nice 
neighborhood league there.

1204
01:14:32,621 --> 01:14:37,621
And so they'd start the kids into teams 
and then they let them play a few demo 

1205
01:14:37,621 --> 01:14:42,511
games and if any team was getting 
stomped flat or any other team was 

1206
01:14:42,511 --> 01:14:47,191
winning too much,
then they'd rebel the team so that they 

1207
01:14:47,191 --> 01:14:50,851
were approximately equal in skill.
So that was the sorting of the teams.

1208
01:14:52,270 --> 01:14:55,030
So um,
and then they,

1209
01:14:55,140 --> 01:15:00,140
then they were on their teams and then 
they'd play 15 games during the regular 

1210
01:15:00,140 --> 01:15:00,140
season.

1211
01:15:00,140 --> 01:15:01,420
They didn't have a little tournament.
See who won?

1212
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:06,960
And it was really good.
It was good friendly league and so my 

1213
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:10,180
son's team was in,
I think it was the championship game,

1214
01:15:10,181 --> 01:15:15,181
if I remember correctly,
and there's one kid on his team who is 

1215
01:15:15,430 --> 01:15:18,190
the best player on the team by quite a 
margin,

1216
01:15:18,250 --> 01:15:20,080
you know,
he was very fast on his feet.

1217
01:15:20,710 --> 01:15:22,540
He could,
he could skate rings around.

1218
01:15:22,541 --> 01:15:24,280
A lot of the kids.
He was good at stick handling.

1219
01:15:24,281 --> 01:15:29,230
He was a good hockey player,
but he had some problems.

1220
01:15:29,231 --> 01:15:34,231
This kid,
one problem was he wouldn't pass the 

1221
01:15:34,231 --> 01:15:34,990
puck.
Now you think,

1222
01:15:34,991 --> 01:15:36,640
well,
why the hell should you pass the puck if

1223
01:15:36,641 --> 01:15:39,760
you're the best hockey player?
Which is pretty much what he thought and

1224
01:15:39,761 --> 01:15:40,990
the answer is,
well,

1225
01:15:42,310 --> 01:15:44,270
you're part of a team,
right?

1226
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:46,510
You want to be the best person on the 
team,

1227
01:15:47,470 --> 01:15:49,750
fair enough and you want to win the 
hockey game,

1228
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:55,500
but you also want to what make your team
mates better players.

1229
01:15:56,320 --> 01:16:01,320
How's that?
Maybe you even want to meet the people 

1230
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:01,320
on other teams,
better players.

1231
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:02,500
I knew now I know that's going a little 
bit too far,

1232
01:16:02,740 --> 01:16:07,740
but you certainly want to make your 
teammates better players and you might 

1233
01:16:07,740 --> 01:16:07,930
think,
well,

1234
01:16:07,931 --> 01:16:12,931
why would you do that?
Because if there are better than maybe 

1235
01:16:12,931 --> 01:16:15,001
you won't be the best while that's a 
boneheaded way of looking at the world 

1236
01:16:15,490 --> 01:16:20,490
because first of all,
if you amp up the competition around 

1237
01:16:20,490 --> 01:16:23,701
you,
maybe that will motivate you to to be 

1238
01:16:23,701 --> 01:16:25,540
even better and it's a hell of a way to 
win by making everyone else lose.

1239
01:16:26,410 --> 01:16:29,740
That's not much of a victory.
And so if you have any sense,

1240
01:16:30,130 --> 01:16:33,400
you pass the damn puck.
Even if you're the better player,

1241
01:16:33,401 --> 01:16:38,401
especially you especially do that.
Let's say you've got a comfortable two 

1242
01:16:38,401 --> 01:16:42,181
goal lead,
well then maybe you can risk taking the 

1243
01:16:42,911 --> 01:16:46,900
time away from that specific game to 
build up the confidence,

1244
01:16:47,290 --> 01:16:52,290
confidence and ability of your teammates
and then maybe everybody thinks that 

1245
01:16:52,290 --> 01:16:53,920
you're a bit of a leader and they make 
you team captain.

1246
01:16:54,190 --> 01:16:56,680
Not even so much because you're the best
hockey player,

1247
01:16:56,681 --> 01:16:58,390
but because.
Well,

1248
01:16:58,391 --> 01:17:00,760
because why?
That's the question.

1249
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:05,880
Okay,
so we're watching the game and it's 

1250
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:08,461
pretty exciting and it's real close game
and it's like three to three and it's a 

1251
01:17:08,461 --> 01:17:13,051
minute left and now their team zips down
the nights and scores are really 

1252
01:17:13,051 --> 01:17:17,770
brilliant goal and so my son's team 
loses except that they were in the 

1253
01:17:18,441 --> 01:17:20,330
championship and it was a really good 
game.

1254
01:17:21,380 --> 01:17:24,110
So you know whether or not they lost is 
not all that obvious.

1255
01:17:24,111 --> 01:17:26,210
They lost that game.
But you know,

1256
01:17:26,211 --> 01:17:28,940
there's a broader context to take into 
consideration.

1257
01:17:29,180 --> 01:17:31,250
Okay.
So this kid,

1258
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:36,720
the star goes off the ice and he takes 
his hockey stick and he smashes it onto 

1259
01:17:37,611 --> 01:17:41,090
the cement and he's all angry because as
far as he was concerned,

1260
01:17:41,270 --> 01:17:46,270
he was robbed.
And maybe that's because of his useless 

1261
01:17:46,270 --> 01:17:48,230
teammates who he didn't really spend any
time helping by the way.

1262
01:17:48,350 --> 01:17:52,580
And maybe it's because the referees were
unfair and who the hell knows why but it

1263
01:17:52,581 --> 01:17:57,581
wasn't fair and his idiot farther rushes
over to them and consoles him in on his 

1264
01:18:00,111 --> 01:18:04,400
loss and supports him in his notion that
he was robbed.

1265
01:18:05,630 --> 01:18:10,130
And I thought you unspeakable son of a 
bitch

1266
01:18:14,390 --> 01:18:19,390
because he was an arrogant narcissist 
and it was way more important to him 

1267
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:25,300
that he had a son who was a star then 
that he had a son who is a good person 

1268
01:18:27,910 --> 01:18:32,670
and that's absolutely inexcusable.
He made the wrong choice.

1269
01:18:32,970 --> 01:18:37,970
He sacrificed his son's soul in part to 
help them save face for a hockey game.

1270
01:18:40,570 --> 01:18:44,770
That's not acceptable.
Okay?

1271
01:18:44,771 --> 01:18:46,240
So here's what you tell your children.

1272
01:18:48,690 --> 01:18:50,190
It doesn't matter whether you win or 
lose,

1273
01:18:50,191 --> 01:18:55,191
it matters how you play the game.
And so that's what the father should 

1274
01:18:55,191 --> 01:18:56,400
have told the son and he should have 
meant it.

1275
01:18:56,730 --> 01:18:58,860
And even better,
he should have known what it meant.

1276
01:18:59,430 --> 01:19:04,430
But who knows what that means because 
you tell your children that and maybe 

1277
01:19:04,430 --> 01:19:07,260
they're not so happy because they lost a
game and they look at you like you're an

1278
01:19:07,261 --> 01:19:09,150
alien.
And they think,

1279
01:19:09,151 --> 01:19:10,530
well,
what the hell do you mean by that?

1280
01:19:10,531 --> 01:19:15,450
Because obviously it matters whether you
win and it does matter whether you win.

1281
01:19:15,690 --> 01:19:17,790
So what is it that you mean when you say
that?

1282
01:19:18,150 --> 01:19:19,260
And your kid asks,
well,

1283
01:19:19,261 --> 01:19:21,390
what do you mean by that?
And you go,

1284
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:22,770
well,
I don't know what it means,

1285
01:19:22,771 --> 01:19:27,771
but it's a good rule.
So what do you mean by that?

1286
01:19:29,650 --> 01:19:30,790
Here's what you mean,

1287
01:19:32,510 --> 01:19:35,090
and it relates to rule five,
which is don't make your.

1288
01:19:35,150 --> 01:19:40,150
Don't let your children do anything that
makes you dislike them because other 

1289
01:19:40,150 --> 01:19:43,151
people will dislike them.
That and you don't want other people to 

1290
01:19:43,151 --> 01:19:46,181
dislike your children unless you want 
your children to inhabit a world where 

1291
01:19:46,181 --> 01:19:49,490
everyone dislikes them and maybe you do 
because you don't like your children and

1292
01:19:49,491 --> 01:19:52,280
maybe you don't like your children 
because you let them behave in ways that

1293
01:19:52,281 --> 01:19:57,281
makes you not like them.
And so the way you take revenge is by 

1294
01:19:57,281 --> 01:20:00,280
not correcting them so that other people
will punish them because you don't have 

1295
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:03,791
the courage to discipline them.
And if you think that people don't play 

1296
01:20:03,791 --> 01:20:06,971
that game,
then you don't know much about people 

1297
01:20:06,971 --> 01:20:06,971
because they play that game all the 
time,

1298
01:20:07,180 --> 01:20:07,890
right?
So

1299
01:20:10,550 --> 01:20:15,550
it matters how you play the game.
It doesn't matter whether you win or 

1300
01:20:15,550 --> 01:20:15,550
lose.
Let's take that apart.

1301
01:20:15,550 --> 01:20:16,010
Well,
so the first thing is,

1302
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:21,280
and this goes back to the idea of the 
hierarchy is order a hierarchy and the 

1303
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:25,181
answer is no,
it's a set of all hierarchies or you 

1304
01:20:25,181 --> 01:20:28,370
could say it's the.
It's the set of all possible hierarchies

1305
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:31,550
because you know in in a society at a 
given time,

1306
01:20:31,850 --> 01:20:34,790
there's hierarchies that function,
but that transforms and then there's new

1307
01:20:34,791 --> 01:20:39,791
hierarchies that function,
the specifics of the hierarchies change,

1308
01:20:40,550 --> 01:20:45,550
but the fact of the hierarchies remains 
and so you can imagine a hierarchy as a 

1309
01:20:45,741 --> 01:20:50,741
metal structure that consists of a 
multitude of possible hierarchies and 

1310
01:20:50,931 --> 01:20:52,670
that's going to change as life 
continues.

1311
01:20:52,671 --> 01:20:57,671
And so what you want for your children 
is not to be the master of our 

1312
01:20:57,671 --> 01:21:01,300
hierarchy.
You want for your children to be the 

1313
01:21:01,300 --> 01:21:01,640
master of the set of all possible 
hierarchies

1314
01:21:03,050 --> 01:21:04,710
because then no matter how things 
change,

1315
01:21:04,711 --> 01:21:06,500
they're ready.
Say,

1316
01:21:06,501 --> 01:21:11,501
well,
how is it that you get ready for things 

1317
01:21:11,501 --> 01:21:13,961
to change?
And the answer is play so that people 

1318
01:21:13,961 --> 01:21:15,110
will invite you to play.
Right?

1319
01:21:15,111 --> 01:21:16,510
And there's a rule for,
for,

1320
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:18,800
for children,
for raising children,

1321
01:21:18,980 --> 01:21:20,330
and it really,
it's a rule.

1322
01:21:20,690 --> 01:21:22,520
One of the things you can do with your 
children,

1323
01:21:22,790 --> 01:21:27,790
this is something good for men because 
men are more likely to do this than 

1324
01:21:27,790 --> 01:21:27,830
women,
although women can do it too,

1325
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:33,040
but men are more likely to do it.
It's really good for children to engage 

1326
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:34,370
in rough and tumble play,
play fighting.

1327
01:21:35,180 --> 01:21:40,180
First of all,
if you have children and you've played 

1328
01:21:40,180 --> 01:21:41,300
with them physically,
you know that they absolutely love it.

1329
01:21:41,690 --> 01:21:42,410
They will

1330
01:21:43,830 --> 01:21:48,830
rough and tumble play with you until you
are completely exhausted and they're not

1331
01:21:48,901 --> 01:21:53,901
even vaguely ready to quit.
They have an inexhaustible hunger for it

1332
01:21:54,690 --> 01:21:57,810
and they like it.
They like to be pushed to the edge,

1333
01:21:58,650 --> 01:22:03,650
so I knew this when I was a new father,
partly because I read work by a man 

1334
01:22:03,650 --> 01:22:05,970
named Jaak Panksepp,
who was a genius,

1335
01:22:06,330 --> 01:22:11,330
an affective neuroscientist,
one of the world's great 

1336
01:22:11,330 --> 01:22:13,581
neuroscientists,
perhaps the world's greatest 

1337
01:22:13,581 --> 01:22:16,101
neuroscientist,
although there's four or five people 

1338
01:22:16,101 --> 01:22:17,991
that might compete with them.
He wrote a book called affective 

1339
01:22:17,991 --> 01:22:18,000
neuroscience,
emotional neuroscience,

1340
01:22:18,001 --> 01:22:23,001
which is a work of real genius.
He discovered the place circuit in 

1341
01:22:23,001 --> 01:22:24,030
mammals because there's a separate place
or could in mammals,

1342
01:22:24,031 --> 01:22:29,031
a specialized circuit and he did a lot 
of work on rats and showing that in 

1343
01:22:29,031 --> 01:22:32,070
order for a rat to become socialized 
because rats are highly social,

1344
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:36,030
they had to engage in iterative bouts of
rough and tumble play,

1345
01:22:36,540 --> 01:22:37,740
and here's a cool thing.

1346
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:42,630
It's a ridiculously cool thing.
So and this has to do in some sense with

1347
01:22:42,631 --> 01:22:45,210
the postmodern critique of the 
patriarchal tyranny.

1348
01:22:45,630 --> 01:22:50,190
So if you take two juvenile rats,
males,

1349
01:22:51,270 --> 01:22:56,270
and you imagine you give them an 
opportunity to play,

1350
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:59,610
so you throw two of them into a little 
player arena and you let them wrestle.

1351
01:23:00,270 --> 01:23:03,120
Okay.
The next time that you bring them to the

1352
01:23:03,121 --> 01:23:06,430
same place,
you can measure how much work they'll do

1353
01:23:06,431 --> 01:23:10,570
to open the door to the arena.
How many times they'll push a button,

1354
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:13,480
say to open the door or how hard,
how hard.

1355
01:23:13,481 --> 01:23:16,330
They'll pull a few tie a string spring 
to their tail,

1356
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:21,720
and so you can get an estimate of their 
motivation because the more motivated 

1357
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:22,150
they are to play,
the harder they'll work.

1358
01:23:22,420 --> 01:23:27,280
And rats will work really hard to play.
So you know that they want to play.

1359
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:32,600
I mean,
assuming that you're willing to accept 

1360
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:32,600
the fact that if you work for something,
you want it.

1361
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:35,440
It's like an operational definition.
So rats will work to play.

1362
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:41,760
Now if you let the rats out in the play 
arena and one rat is 10 percent bigger 

1363
01:23:42,101 --> 01:23:44,410
than the other,
then that rat will win.

1364
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:45,640
You might say,
well,

1365
01:23:45,641 --> 01:23:48,970
what does winning mean?
Rats wrestle like people wrestle.

1366
01:23:49,150 --> 01:23:53,410
They even pin each other and they 
manifest play behavior to begin with.

1367
01:23:53,411 --> 01:23:58,411
Like dogs playing in a park.
You know how a dog looks when it wants 

1368
01:23:58,411 --> 01:23:58,480
to play,
sort of hunkers down a little bit.

1369
01:23:58,690 --> 01:24:03,040
Looks up at you like expectancy 
expectedly kind of move back and forth,

1370
01:24:03,041 --> 01:24:04,630
which is like,
okay human,

1371
01:24:05,020 --> 01:24:10,020
I'm ready to play.
And if you have any sense and you know 

1372
01:24:10,020 --> 01:24:10,020
how to play,
then you look at the dog and you sort of

1373
01:24:10,020 --> 01:24:14,881
go like this and the dog goes like this,
and you cuff the dog not too hard and 

1374
01:24:15,011 --> 01:24:16,630
the dog bites you.
Not too hard.

1375
01:24:16,631 --> 01:24:19,060
And then you can play and you're both 
happy with that.

1376
01:24:19,061 --> 01:24:24,061
And kids can do that with dogs because 
kids understand dogs and dogs and kids 

1377
01:24:24,061 --> 01:24:26,320
knew how to play.
If your dog can play,

1378
01:24:26,321 --> 01:24:29,980
then you should not own a dog because 
you're not smart enough to own a dog.

1379
01:24:30,550 --> 01:24:34,660
So it's true.
And if you have a dog that can't play,

1380
01:24:34,780 --> 01:24:37,150
then don't have a kid.
Right?

1381
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:47,220
It's true.
Stupid.

1382
01:24:47,221 --> 01:24:52,221
His dog I ever saw was owned by a 
psychologist that was really 

1383
01:24:52,221 --> 01:24:54,410
embarrassing.
So okay,

1384
01:24:54,420 --> 01:24:59,420
so you put the rat to rats together and 
there's the 10 percent bigger route and 

1385
01:24:59,420 --> 01:25:03,841
there's the 10 percent smaller rat and 
the 10 percent bigger rat stomps the 

1386
01:25:03,841 --> 01:25:05,680
small rat and pins him.
So he wins.

1387
01:25:06,760 --> 01:25:11,760
And so now you're a postmodernist doing 
the experiment and you say powerful,

1388
01:25:12,101 --> 01:25:15,790
tyrannical rat dominates hierarchy.
Really?

1389
01:25:15,850 --> 01:25:20,850
Really?
That's what you conclude and of 

1390
01:25:20,850 --> 01:25:22,120
experiment and you're.
And it looks correct because powerful,

1391
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:26,230
dominant rat dominated and one,
it's like,

1392
01:25:26,231 --> 01:25:29,530
okay,
except for one thing,

1393
01:25:30,820 --> 01:25:33,820
rats live with rats.
They don't wander.

1394
01:25:33,970 --> 01:25:37,570
They're not psychopathic individuals.
Wandering from isolated community,

1395
01:25:37,571 --> 01:25:42,571
dissect a community.
They know all the other rats and that 

1396
01:25:42,571 --> 01:25:46,861
means they have to keep playing with 
them and the rules for playing with 

1397
01:25:46,861 --> 01:25:50,851
someone 30 times are not the same as the
rules for playing with someone once.

1398
01:25:52,420 --> 01:25:57,400
So Pang sap had the rats play repeatedly
and what he observed was,

1399
01:25:57,401 --> 01:26:02,401
okay,
now the next time you put those rats 

1400
01:26:02,401 --> 01:26:02,401
together,
the situation's a little different.

1401
01:26:02,401 --> 01:26:06,530
The little rat comes bouncing out and 
does the playful dog thing too.

1402
01:26:06,531 --> 01:26:09,440
The big rat.
So now the rule is you're the little rat

1403
01:26:09,470 --> 01:26:12,530
you lost.
You have to be the creature that invites

1404
01:26:12,531 --> 01:26:14,420
to play.
That's now your status.

1405
01:26:14,630 --> 01:26:17,090
So you bounced around and you know,
the big rats all cool.

1406
01:26:17,091 --> 01:26:18,730
And he's smoking a cigarette and he 
doesn't want to,

1407
01:26:19,150 --> 01:26:24,150
doesn't want to play,
but they'll flick it away at some point 

1408
01:26:24,150 --> 01:26:24,150
and think,
all right,

1409
01:26:24,150 --> 01:26:27,881
what the hell you know?
And so then he gets in it and so nico 

1410
01:26:27,881 --> 01:26:28,730
can stomp the little route again because
he's a bigger rat.

1411
01:26:29,780 --> 01:26:34,780
If the big Grad doesn't let the little 
rat win 30 percent of the time across 

1412
01:26:34,780 --> 01:26:38,801
repeated play boats,
then the little rat won't ask him to 

1413
01:26:38,801 --> 01:26:38,801
play anymore.

1414
01:26:38,801 --> 01:26:40,310
You think,
well,

1415
01:26:40,311 --> 01:26:42,380
if you think about,
you don't think so,

1416
01:26:42,381 --> 01:26:47,381
what you don't think,
why did Jaak Panksepp waste his time 

1417
01:26:47,381 --> 01:26:47,381
studying play in rats?
You Think,

1418
01:26:47,381 --> 01:26:51,371
oh my God,
that's an absolute miracle because it 

1419
01:26:51,371 --> 01:26:54,281
shows you that there's an ethic of 
fairplay that emerges as a consequence 

1420
01:26:54,281 --> 01:26:56,450
of repeated bouts of play.
Even among rats.

1421
01:26:57,350 --> 01:26:59,750
It's so basic.
It isn't even human.

1422
01:27:00,020 --> 01:27:03,620
That ethic they effect of fair play is 
deeper than human.

1423
01:27:04,130 --> 01:27:09,130
It's real and it's the ethic that 
governs iterated interactions and it's 

1424
01:27:09,861 --> 01:27:14,270
not just in rats that we've seen this.
So chimpanzees are pretty damn brutal.

1425
01:27:14,420 --> 01:27:16,940
They're way more brutal than you think,
and they're really,

1426
01:27:16,941 --> 01:27:21,941
really strong.
Maybe six times as strong as an adult 

1427
01:27:21,941 --> 01:27:22,640
male.
Now there's the estimates vary,

1428
01:27:22,641 --> 01:27:26,450
but there are plenty strong enough to 
tear you to bits and that happens now.

1429
01:27:26,451 --> 01:27:31,451
And then people have chimps for pets and
they become adults and it's like don't 

1430
01:27:31,451 --> 01:27:33,770
miss with the chimp because it'll tear 
you to pieces.

1431
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:38,920
And so and chimps are brutal and this is
interesting because they're our closest 

1432
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:43,871
relatives and so Jane Goodall discovered
in the 19 seventies that rats or tribe 

1433
01:27:44,481 --> 01:27:48,050
or chimps are tribal.
They live in tribal groups like we do,

1434
01:27:48,530 --> 01:27:53,530
and they have a territory that's the 
known territory and there's a perimeter 

1435
01:27:53,530 --> 01:27:57,640
that's the unknown,
that's chaos and other chimpanzees 

1436
01:27:57,640 --> 01:28:00,821
inhabit the chaos.
Foreign Chimpanzees and the juvenile 

1437
01:28:00,821 --> 01:28:03,590
chimps patrol the perimeters in groups 
of four or five,

1438
01:28:03,830 --> 01:28:07,520
and if they buy us a foreign chimp or 
two of them,

1439
01:28:07,640 --> 01:28:09,650
if they outnumber them because they 
can't count,

1440
01:28:09,651 --> 01:28:14,651
but they have a sense of quantity.
If five chimps come across to foreign 

1441
01:28:14,651 --> 01:28:19,210
chimps,
they will tear them to bits and I 

1442
01:28:19,210 --> 01:28:19,760
actually mean that literally.
That's what they do.

1443
01:28:20,240 --> 01:28:22,370
And chimps also hunt.
They hunt,

1444
01:28:22,371 --> 01:28:27,371
call a bus monkeys and they weigh about 
40 pounds and they're quite carnivorous 

1445
01:28:27,371 --> 01:28:27,740
and they will eat them alive.

1446
01:28:27,880 --> 01:28:32,880
They're screaming.
So there isn't a lot of empathy 

1447
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:36,760
regulating chimp aggression,
which is something to think about when 

1448
01:28:36,760 --> 01:28:40,661
you think about human beings because 
it's not obvious what regulates our 

1449
01:28:40,661 --> 01:28:40,661
aggression.
And you might think,

1450
01:28:40,661 --> 01:28:41,810
well,
it's your conscience.

1451
01:28:41,930 --> 01:28:43,190
And like,
yeah,

1452
01:28:43,250 --> 01:28:46,310
maybe it's your conscience and maybe 
it's something else.

1453
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:51,520
You read the book,
have you read the rape of Nanking for 

1454
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:51,530
example,
and you'll start wondering very,

1455
01:28:51,531 --> 01:28:54,350
very rapidly about whether people have 
any conscience at all.

1456
01:28:54,650 --> 01:28:59,650
So that's a story of absolutely 
atrocious Japanese behavior in China at,

1457
01:29:00,520 --> 01:29:03,480
at the beginning of World War II,
and it's a horrifying book.

1458
01:29:03,540 --> 01:29:06,450
So read it with caution,
but it's very instructive.

1459
01:29:06,930 --> 01:29:09,480
So anyways,
the chimps,

1460
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:13,140
the chimps are very brutal creatures and
so you might think,

1461
01:29:13,141 --> 01:29:18,141
well let's look at a chimp hierarchy 
because chimps have dominance 

1462
01:29:18,141 --> 01:29:18,720
hierarchies and they're basically male 
dominated,

1463
01:29:18,721 --> 01:29:22,110
although there are lots of powerful 
female chimps say,

1464
01:29:22,111 --> 01:29:24,360
okay,
who becomes the dominant chimp?

1465
01:29:25,110 --> 01:29:28,020
And the answer might be,
and this would be the postmodern answer,

1466
01:29:28,410 --> 01:29:33,410
the most powerful tyrannical brutal 
chimp rules because it's power that 

1467
01:29:34,621 --> 01:29:39,621
moves you up the hierarchy.
It's like that happened sometimes among 

1468
01:29:39,621 --> 01:29:39,720
chimps,
but you know,

1469
01:29:39,721 --> 01:29:44,721
what happens to tyron chimps,
they have an off day and to subordinate 

1470
01:29:46,591 --> 01:29:51,591
chimps each three quarters,
the size gang up to make a one and a 

1471
01:29:51,591 --> 01:29:54,450
half super chimp and then they tear him 
to pieces.

1472
01:29:55,470 --> 01:29:57,540
Right?
So here's the rule,

1473
01:29:57,541 --> 01:30:01,110
if you're a chimp tyrants meet bloody 
ends,

1474
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:07,040
so how do you conduct yourself as a 
chimp if you want to be at the top of 

1475
01:30:07,201 --> 01:30:12,201
the hierarchy and have preferential 
access to the things that being at the 

1476
01:30:12,201 --> 01:30:16,071
top of the hierarchy would give you and 
the answer is engage in mutually 

1477
01:30:16,231 --> 01:30:21,231
reciprocal interactions with your peers.
The chimps that rise to the top that 

1478
01:30:21,450 --> 01:30:26,450
stay there stable he and also have the 
most stable functioning troops by the 

1479
01:30:26,450 --> 01:30:30,081
way are the ones that have friends that 
are long term and permanent and engage 

1480
01:30:30,081 --> 01:30:34,791
in reciprocal interactions not only with
their friends but also with the females 

1481
01:30:34,791 --> 01:30:36,300
and the infants and so even among 
chimps,

1482
01:30:37,470 --> 01:30:42,470
patriarchal tyranny,
a is not the norm and B is not the 

1483
01:30:42,470 --> 01:30:46,401
proper motive approaching the situation,
and so that speaks to a broader ethic.

1484
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:52,400
The same kind of ethic that is spoken to
with regards to the rat studies have 

1485
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:55,020
play behavior and you can see this sort 
of thing throughout the animal kingdom.

1486
01:30:55,640 --> 01:31:00,640
There's A.
There's a pattern of reciprocal 

1487
01:31:00,640 --> 01:31:02,421
interaction that seems to stabilize 
social animals that isn't predicated on 

1488
01:31:02,421 --> 01:31:04,650
brute force.
Now maybe the simpler the animal,

1489
01:31:05,730 --> 01:31:10,730
the more it's predicated on brute force,
but we are by no means simple animals 

1490
01:31:10,730 --> 01:31:14,160
and the idea that our hierarchies are 
fundamentally tyrannical,

1491
01:31:14,460 --> 01:31:19,460
the patriarchy,
which is a word that nobody who thinks 

1492
01:31:19,460 --> 01:31:23,660
carefully should ever use casually,
that term is predicated on the idea that

1493
01:31:24,630 --> 01:31:26,940
a,
that are hierarchies are tyrannical,

1494
01:31:27,150 --> 01:31:30,420
which they aren't,
although they can become that way and be

1495
01:31:30,421 --> 01:31:35,421
that the most reliable means to 
attaining status within a hierarchy is 

1496
01:31:35,421 --> 01:31:39,300
through the expression of power and both
of those things are wrong.

1497
01:31:39,990 --> 01:31:42,270
They are wrong,
and nonetheless,

1498
01:31:42,271 --> 01:31:47,271
that's the primary theory of the social 
sciences and the humanities and enough 

1499
01:31:47,271 --> 01:31:47,750
of that,
we've,

1500
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:52,880
we have enough data to indicate that 
none of that's sufficiently 

1501
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:56,730
sophisticated to constitute a reasonable
explanation of the world.

1502
01:31:57,420 --> 01:32:00,130
So we should dispense with it as fast as
possible.

1503
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:04,570
All it's doing is dividing us into 
tribes and it's not solving the problems

1504
01:32:04,690 --> 01:32:06,970
that it's hypothetically intended to 
solve.

1505
01:32:07,700 --> 01:32:08,140
So.

1506
01:32:15,450 --> 01:32:20,040
Okay,
so now back to the question.

1507
01:32:20,070 --> 01:32:20,460
So

1508
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:28,920
there isn't a hierarchy.
There's a set of hierarchies and it's 

1509
01:32:28,920 --> 01:32:33,571
like the set of games.
So here's what you're telling your 

1510
01:32:33,571 --> 01:32:36,661
child.
When you say it doesn't matter whether 

1511
01:32:36,661 --> 01:32:36,940
you win or lose,
it matters how you play the game.

1512
01:32:36,970 --> 01:32:40,060
What you're telling them is life is not 
a game.

1513
01:32:41,410 --> 01:32:43,900
It's not even a sequence of the same 
games.

1514
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:46,660
It's multiple sequences of different 
games,

1515
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:52,800
and if you want to be a successful 
player in the set of multiple sequence 

1516
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:57,271
of different games,
then you have to adopt a higher order 

1517
01:32:57,271 --> 01:33:00,421
ethic and you don't subordinate that 
ethic to victory in any one game ever.

1518
01:33:01,900 --> 01:33:06,340
So you put the manner in which you play 
above your victory in,

1519
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:11,520
in each instance,
and the reason that that produces the 

1520
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:15,331
best possible outcome for you is that 
you get invited to play the largest 

1521
01:33:15,331 --> 01:33:17,740
number of games.
And so let's go back to rule five.

1522
01:33:17,770 --> 01:33:20,590
Don't let your children do anything that
makes you dislike them.

1523
01:33:21,010 --> 01:33:22,870
Okay?
So let's say you like your children.

1524
01:33:23,620 --> 01:33:26,260
Let's say you love your children and you
want the best for them.

1525
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:28,600
You've detached yourself in a little bit
and you think,

1526
01:33:28,601 --> 01:33:33,601
well,
I'm not going to be around forever and 

1527
01:33:33,601 --> 01:33:35,470
they're going to deal with a lot of 
different people,

1528
01:33:36,790 --> 01:33:39,130
single people,
like individuals,

1529
01:33:39,490 --> 01:33:43,030
groups of people,
children and adults,

1530
01:33:43,480 --> 01:33:48,480
and what they have to be prepared for is
to interact with that set of people in 

1531
01:33:48,641 --> 01:33:52,090
the best possible manner because and so 
what do you want?

1532
01:33:52,091 --> 01:33:54,190
Well,
let's say your child's two,

1533
01:33:54,310 --> 01:33:59,310
and it's still pretty egocentric because
children shoot two year olds are quite 

1534
01:33:59,310 --> 01:34:00,310
egocentric.
They can't share yet.

1535
01:34:00,520 --> 01:34:03,850
They don't really learn how to share in 
any technical sense.

1536
01:34:03,880 --> 01:34:06,910
Tiller about three.
It's hard for them to learn to share

1537
01:34:09,860 --> 01:34:14,860
between two and four.
They learn to share and to play and the 

1538
01:34:14,860 --> 01:34:18,281
way they learn is by at least in part,
by engaging in reciprocal interactions 

1539
01:34:18,281 --> 01:34:18,440
with their parents.
Now,

1540
01:34:18,441 --> 01:34:20,360
what is it that it.
What is it?

1541
01:34:20,361 --> 01:34:24,230
That's your job when you're socializing 
a child who's two to four,

1542
01:34:24,410 --> 01:34:27,560
you have to do it between the ages of 
two and four by the way,

1543
01:34:27,830 --> 01:34:30,500
because if you don't manage it by the 
time they're four,

1544
01:34:30,710 --> 01:34:35,710
then you might as well give up because 
it isn't going to happen and the 

1545
01:34:35,710 --> 01:34:38,240
literature on antisocial behavior in 
children is crystal clear on this point.

1546
01:34:38,810 --> 01:34:43,810
If your child's antisocial ad for you 
failed and there isn't anything that can

1547
01:34:44,751 --> 01:34:47,840
be done about it,
it's a dismal literature and believe me,

1548
01:34:48,140 --> 01:34:53,140
psychologists and sociologists and 
anthropologists and criminologists have 

1549
01:34:53,140 --> 01:34:57,761
tried for like six decades to figure out
how to remediate anti social in older 

1550
01:34:58,551 --> 01:35:03,050
children and adolescents and they 
haven't managed it so.

1551
01:35:03,950 --> 01:35:06,350
So between two and four is crucial.

1552
01:35:08,810 --> 01:35:13,810
You want to help your child become the 
sort of person that other children want 

1553
01:35:13,810 --> 01:35:17,021
to play with.
And the reason you want to do that is 

1554
01:35:17,021 --> 01:35:19,160
because from four onward,
other children are the primary agents of

1555
01:35:19,161 --> 01:35:24,161
socialization.
And so if your children are accepted by 

1556
01:35:24,161 --> 01:35:27,701
other children,
then they're on their way because other 

1557
01:35:27,701 --> 01:35:30,611
children will socialize them.
Doesn't mean you're not important as a 

1558
01:35:30,611 --> 01:35:33,041
parent,
but it means they find their peers who 

1559
01:35:33,041 --> 01:35:36,161
are at the same developmental level as 
them and they start to reciprocally 

1560
01:35:36,161 --> 01:35:40,811
socialize one another and they do that 
through play and so if you've prepared 

1561
01:35:40,811 --> 01:35:45,011
your child to be a great play companion,
then you can just stand back and let it 

1562
01:35:45,411 --> 01:35:48,110
happen and you have to be around when 
something breaks down.

1563
01:35:48,290 --> 01:35:51,230
When the system doesn't work properly,
you have to be there as a resource,

1564
01:35:51,410 --> 01:35:54,980
but basically you can sort of push them 
out onto the playground and say,

1565
01:35:55,370 --> 01:35:56,420
you know,
you know what to do.

1566
01:35:56,510 --> 01:36:01,510
Go play and play is of absolutely 
crucial importance as documented by 

1567
01:36:02,571 --> 01:36:07,571
people like John Piaget,
so you're trying to make your child 

1568
01:36:07,881 --> 01:36:12,881
maximally attractive as a play partner,
and the ethic there is while the world 

1569
01:36:12,881 --> 01:36:16,631
is made out of a sequence of hierarchies
that transform and so you want your 

1570
01:36:17,631 --> 01:36:22,631
child to be the sort of person who's 
invited to participate in whatever 

1571
01:36:22,631 --> 01:36:27,370
hierarchy organizes itself and how and 
what should a child be like to do that 

1572
01:36:29,420 --> 01:36:31,670
while they have to be.
Be Reciprocal.

1573
01:36:32,180 --> 01:36:36,140
Take turns right.
You don't always get to pick the game.

1574
01:36:36,740 --> 01:36:38,630
You have to find out what other people 
want to do.

1575
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:43,720
They have to want to play too.
Like there's all these sophisticated 

1576
01:36:43,720 --> 01:36:46,100
ethical rules that go around play and 
you know,

1577
01:36:46,101 --> 01:36:49,190
if you're playing with some of you have 
played with kids that aren't fun to play

1578
01:36:49,191 --> 01:36:50,870
with,
well what do they like?

1579
01:36:51,260 --> 01:36:53,660
If something doesn't go their way,
what happens?

1580
01:36:54,260 --> 01:36:58,730
They have an emotional outburst so they 
revert to the behavior of ill prepared.

1581
01:36:58,731 --> 01:37:01,010
Two year old,
they have a temper tantrum.

1582
01:37:01,011 --> 01:37:04,310
They burst into tears,
they thrash around on the floor.

1583
01:37:04,900 --> 01:37:09,830
It's not fun because when you play,
if you don't lose some times that no one

1584
01:37:09,831 --> 01:37:12,320
else ever wins,
so who the hell's going to play with?

1585
01:37:12,321 --> 01:37:16,460
Someone like that,
a downtrodden victim,

1586
01:37:16,490 --> 01:37:17,990
that's all.
It's not.

1587
01:37:18,380 --> 01:37:20,750
No kid with any senses is going to put 
up with that.

1588
01:37:20,751 --> 01:37:22,790
All they,
and this is exactly what kids are like,

1589
01:37:23,540 --> 01:37:28,540
if they find out that their potential 
play partner is a whiny two year old,

1590
01:37:28,730 --> 01:37:32,360
even though therefore they just start 
playing and they go find another kid.

1591
01:37:32,660 --> 01:37:36,140
That's exactly what happens,
and so if you want that for your kid,

1592
01:37:36,141 --> 01:37:38,930
then make sure that they're whiny and 
bitter every time they lose.

1593
01:37:39,110 --> 01:37:44,110
A good way to do that is to never let 
them lose at anything so they don't get 

1594
01:37:44,110 --> 01:37:44,450
any practice.
Well,

1595
01:37:44,451 --> 01:37:47,540
I don't want my kid to lose.
It's like wrong.

1596
01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:53,080
You don't want to.
You don't want your kid to lose in an 

1597
01:37:53,080 --> 01:37:54,650
unsophisticated manner.
That's not the same thing at all.

1598
01:37:54,651 --> 01:37:58,290
And if you think the way you accomplish 
that is by never having your kid lose,

1599
01:37:58,291 --> 01:37:59,610
then well then,

1600
01:38:01,420 --> 01:38:04,210
well then we're back to the.
You shouldn't even own a dog problem.

1601
01:38:11,560 --> 01:38:14,140
All right,
so then you might take apart.

1602
01:38:15,070 --> 01:38:17,500
What does it mean to be a desirable play
partner?

1603
01:38:17,980 --> 01:38:19,540
Assuming you're going to play 
reciprocal,

1604
01:38:19,541 --> 01:38:22,300
repeated games across all sorts of 
different contexts.

1605
01:38:22,900 --> 01:38:23,790
Well,
there's a.

1606
01:38:23,830 --> 01:38:25,780
there's a whole ethic that emerges from 
that.

1607
01:38:26,440 --> 01:38:31,440
See Nature back in the late 18 hundreds,
he was the first person to kind of 

1608
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:32,770
caught onto this sort of thing because 
until then,

1609
01:38:33,130 --> 01:38:38,130
people tended to think of morality as 
something that was invented rationally 

1610
01:38:38,130 --> 01:38:42,811
and then imposed from the top down.
But nature being a very intelligent 

1611
01:38:42,811 --> 01:38:46,000
observer noted that that wasn't really 
the case.

1612
01:38:46,150 --> 01:38:51,150
There was a ethic already built into 
human interactions that we all acted 

1613
01:38:51,881 --> 01:38:56,881
out,
but that we didn't really understand 

1614
01:38:56,881 --> 01:38:56,881
very well.
So here's a way to think about that.

1615
01:38:57,430 --> 01:39:02,430
So imagine you're watching a wolf pack 
and wolves compete for dominance.

1616
01:39:03,160 --> 01:39:07,240
And so the way they do that is they 
basically have a play fight about it.

1617
01:39:07,270 --> 01:39:12,270
Now it's this fairly serious play fight.
And so two wolves that are engaged in a 

1618
01:39:12,270 --> 01:39:14,740
dominance dispute will sort of sand 
sideways to each other.

1619
01:39:15,250 --> 01:39:20,250
You know how cats do that?
Do you ever watched two caps fight cats 

1620
01:39:20,250 --> 01:39:20,470
stand sideways,
think,

1621
01:39:20,471 --> 01:39:22,240
well,
why does it cat stand sideways when it's

1622
01:39:22,241 --> 01:39:27,241
fighting?
It's because a sideways cat is a bigger 

1623
01:39:27,241 --> 01:39:30,271
cat than a hand on cat.
So the cat's trying to intimidate the 

1624
01:39:30,271 --> 01:39:33,280
other cats so it stand sideways and it 
puffs itself up including its tail.

1625
01:39:33,580 --> 01:39:37,540
And the reason it does that is so that 
it looks bigger because one cat isn't.

1626
01:39:37,570 --> 01:39:42,570
The cats don't want to fight.
They want to threaten until one cat 

1627
01:39:42,570 --> 01:39:46,951
backs down.
And so they puff themselves up and they 

1628
01:39:46,951 --> 01:39:47,770
make horrible noises and they face off 
against each other,

1629
01:39:47,950 --> 01:39:52,950
but they don't want to fight because the
two cats that are fighting my damage 

1630
01:39:52,950 --> 01:39:53,950
each other,
then a third cat comes in and like wins.

1631
01:39:54,190 --> 01:39:56,780
It's a stupid strategy.
So it's.

1632
01:39:56,790 --> 01:39:57,550
It is.
It's so.

1633
01:39:57,580 --> 01:40:00,670
Most animals don't like to fight because
they might damage to themselves.

1634
01:40:00,671 --> 01:40:02,530
And then another interloper.
We'll just,

1635
01:40:02,531 --> 01:40:06,160
when it's a stupid strategy and human 
beings are quite a bit like that.

1636
01:40:06,161 --> 01:40:08,890
We do a lot of posturing and defensive 
display,

1637
01:40:08,891 --> 01:40:11,700
an aggressive display and all that.
But we don't fight very often for the,

1638
01:40:11,730 --> 01:40:16,730
for the same reasons.
And it's only when those other 

1639
01:40:16,730 --> 01:40:16,730
mechanisms breakdown that we actually 
fight.

1640
01:40:17,530 --> 01:40:17,980
So

1641
01:40:23,830 --> 01:40:28,830
what happens in a wolf dispute is this,
the wolves square off and they amp up 

1642
01:40:30,910 --> 01:40:35,910
the threats in the hope that one of the 
wolves will back the hell down because 

1643
01:40:35,910 --> 01:40:39,430
what'll happen is the wolf will chicken 
out one of them and then when it does,

1644
01:40:39,431 --> 01:40:43,420
it rolls over and shows its neck.
Why?

1645
01:40:44,050 --> 01:40:45,610
Well,
because when wolves hunt,

1646
01:40:46,030 --> 01:40:47,620
they go for the neck.
Generally.

1647
01:40:47,621 --> 01:40:50,080
Like wolves are quite cruel creatures in
some sense,

1648
01:40:50,081 --> 01:40:53,140
and they'll actually eat moose standing 
up,

1649
01:40:53,380 --> 01:40:55,870
but generally speaking,
if they can manage it,

1650
01:40:55,871 --> 01:40:58,510
they go through for the throat and 
they'll bring the animal down.

1651
01:40:58,900 --> 01:41:02,110
And so what the wolf is basically saying
is,

1652
01:41:03,130 --> 01:41:04,720
well,
you scared me half to death.

1653
01:41:05,110 --> 01:41:07,570
I'm a useful.
I'm a useless moose.

1654
01:41:07,900 --> 01:41:11,470
You might as well tear up my neck.
And other wolf says,

1655
01:41:11,890 --> 01:41:14,310
yeah,
you're pretty detestable and you're kind

1656
01:41:14,311 --> 01:41:17,920
of like a moose,
but I might need you to hunt tomorrow so

1657
01:41:18,730 --> 01:41:20,650
I know I can tear out your neck but I 
won't.

1658
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:26,040
And then the defeated Wolf stands up and
he's not very happy and he's kind of a 

1659
01:41:26,040 --> 01:41:29,080
low status wolf,
but at least he's still got his neck and

1660
01:41:29,081 --> 01:41:34,081
the victor wolf gets to be high status 
wolf and he gets to go hunting with his 

1661
01:41:34,081 --> 01:41:36,370
partner the next day.
And so you might think,

1662
01:41:36,371 --> 01:41:41,371
well,
wolves have a complex procedural 

1663
01:41:41,371 --> 01:41:43,960
morality and morality is don't tear the 
neck out of your,

1664
01:41:44,530 --> 01:41:46,870
out of the per of out of the creature 
you defeat.

1665
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:49,270
That's wrong.
And then you might say,

1666
01:41:49,271 --> 01:41:51,490
well,
that's the rule that will follow,

1667
01:41:51,730 --> 01:41:56,730
but that's wrong because wolves don't 
follow rules because wolves don't have 

1668
01:41:56,730 --> 01:41:58,390
rules because they don't have language 
and they don't think not like us.

1669
01:41:58,630 --> 01:42:03,630
They act like they have rules.
They act so that if you watch them act,

1670
01:42:04,090 --> 01:42:06,790
you could label what they're doing with 
the rule.

1671
01:42:07,570 --> 01:42:09,490
That's how we got our rules.

1672
01:42:10,480 --> 01:42:15,480
That's how we got our rules.
We acted out in ethic and then we 

1673
01:42:16,181 --> 01:42:21,181
watched and then we coded it in stories.
That's what our religious stories are 

1674
01:42:22,420 --> 01:42:27,420
there.
The consequence of us watching what it 

1675
01:42:27,420 --> 01:42:30,121
is that we do when we act ethically and 
then transforming that into a story and 

1676
01:42:30,121 --> 01:42:34,381
everyone's intent on that story exists 
absolutely intent on the story of good 

1677
01:42:34,381 --> 01:42:34,660
versus evil,
let's say,

1678
01:42:34,661 --> 01:42:38,080
because that's the fundamental story.
And why do you want to watch that story?

1679
01:42:38,260 --> 01:42:43,260
Because you want to know how to be the 
victor in the set of all possible games 

1680
01:42:43,260 --> 01:42:46,890
and that's what that story's about and 
that's what movies are about and that's 

1681
01:42:46,890 --> 01:42:48,040
what books are about and that's what 
religious narratives are about.

1682
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:52,060
That's what everything that grips us at 
a literary level is about,

1683
01:42:52,330 --> 01:42:56,020
and the reason that it grips this is 
because that's what the world is made of

1684
01:42:56,110 --> 01:42:57,610
and that's what we need to know.

1685
01:42:58,630 --> 01:43:01,300
So then you might think,
so here's something to think about.

1686
01:43:02,380 --> 01:43:05,050
I'll give you a symbolic representation 
of this.

1687
01:43:05,051 --> 01:43:07,540
Okay,
so there's this idea in Christianity,

1688
01:43:08,210 --> 01:43:11,530
and I'm not talking about this from a 
religious perspective,

1689
01:43:12,070 --> 01:43:17,070
okay,
I'm talking about this from an 

1690
01:43:17,070 --> 01:43:19,170
anthropological perspective or a 
biological perspective or a that'll do 

1691
01:43:21,611 --> 01:43:24,520
an anthropological or a bylaw or 
psychological perspective.

1692
01:43:24,700 --> 01:43:29,700
So there's this idea in Christianity 
that Christ is whatever Christ is the 

1693
01:43:29,741 --> 01:43:32,200
king of kings.
Okay,

1694
01:43:32,201 --> 01:43:36,150
so I'm going to take that apart.
So imagine that you have a hierarchy,

1695
01:43:36,610 --> 01:43:38,950
whatever it is,
and there's someone at the top of it,

1696
01:43:40,060 --> 01:43:45,060
and so that person has the attributes 
necessary to be at the top of that 

1697
01:43:45,060 --> 01:43:48,361
hierarchy and maybe it's a hockey team 
and you go home and you tell a story 

1698
01:43:48,361 --> 01:43:52,111
about how the best hockey player on your
team played while they were being the 

1699
01:43:52,641 --> 01:43:53,480
best hockey player.

1700
01:43:53,770 --> 01:43:58,770
It's a little hero narrative.
It's a little fragment of a hero 

1701
01:43:58,770 --> 01:44:00,860
narrative and maybe it's hockey,
soccer,

1702
01:44:01,070 --> 01:44:02,720
plumbing,
law,

1703
01:44:02,990 --> 01:44:04,460
business,
art.

1704
01:44:04,640 --> 01:44:09,640
There's all these hierarchies and then 
there's the thing that's at the top of 

1705
01:44:09,640 --> 01:44:13,871
all of them and the thing that's all 
that at the top of all of them has 

1706
01:44:13,871 --> 01:44:17,951
something in common.
That's whatever it is that's in common 

1707
01:44:17,951 --> 01:44:19,460
across all the things that are at the 
top.

1708
01:44:20,330 --> 01:44:21,470
So imagine this.
Okay,

1709
01:44:21,471 --> 01:44:26,471
so you could think about this.
Imagine that you're a novelist and you 

1710
01:44:26,471 --> 01:44:30,611
want to distill some characters and you 
want the good evil character because 

1711
01:44:30,611 --> 01:44:34,631
what the hell good is your book without 
a good evil character and you want a 

1712
01:44:34,631 --> 01:44:37,961
good,
good character because the same problem 

1713
01:44:37,961 --> 01:44:40,100
applies.
You don't want it to just tell a story 

1714
01:44:40,100 --> 01:44:40,520
about some guy's Day,
right?

1715
01:44:40,550 --> 01:44:41,570
You don't want to say,
well,

1716
01:44:41,870 --> 01:44:46,870
John woke up at six and then he smacked 
his lips four times in blank 20 times 

1717
01:44:48,410 --> 01:44:52,190
and then he swung his feet over across 
the bed and walked into the bathroom.

1718
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:56,360
Because who cares about any of that?
They don't need to know that because you

1719
01:44:56,361 --> 01:45:00,410
know how to move your mouth and cough 
and walk to the bathroom.

1720
01:45:00,590 --> 01:45:03,380
It's not helpful.
You want a distillation.

1721
01:45:03,381 --> 01:45:06,920
You want the novelist who have watched a
bunch of people in abstract it out,

1722
01:45:06,921 --> 01:45:11,921
someone who's good in a way that's good 
across a bunch of people and you want 

1723
01:45:11,921 --> 01:45:16,040
him to have abstracted out someone who's
evil that's abstracted across a bunch of

1724
01:45:16,041 --> 01:45:18,440
evil characters,
so you see that in hamlet for example.

1725
01:45:18,441 --> 01:45:23,441
You see that Dostoevsky where the where 
the characters are bigger than life and 

1726
01:45:23,441 --> 01:45:27,821
you want them bigger than life because 
you want it distilled so that you can 

1727
01:45:27,821 --> 01:45:29,180
learn from it and what you're learning 
is that ethic.

1728
01:45:30,050 --> 01:45:35,050
Okay,
so that imagine that you have 100 

1729
01:45:35,050 --> 01:45:35,050
hierarchies,
just mundane hierarchies.

1730
01:45:35,050 --> 01:45:40,000
Then you take the people at the top of 
all those hierarchies and say that you 

1731
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:40,000
group them into groups of 10.

1732
01:45:40,850 --> 01:45:42,950
Okay,
so you take 10 admirable people.

1733
01:45:43,660 --> 01:45:44,360
Then you say,
well,

1734
01:45:44,361 --> 01:45:47,360
we're going to average across them and 
we're going to come out with the most ad

1735
01:45:47,660 --> 01:45:51,500
with a composite admirable person made.
Out of those 10,

1736
01:45:52,010 --> 01:45:57,010
you have 100 to begin with,
so let's say you have a thousand to 

1737
01:45:57,010 --> 01:46:00,101
begin with.
You distill them to 100 admirable 

1738
01:46:00,101 --> 01:46:02,531
people.
Then you take that hundred admirable 

1739
01:46:02,531 --> 01:46:02,531
people in,
you distill them into 10.

1740
01:46:02,770 --> 01:46:07,030
Then you take those 10 admirable people 
and you distilled them into one and what

1741
01:46:07,040 --> 01:46:10,790
that one is is what's admirable across 
the entire set of admirable people.

1742
01:46:12,170 --> 01:46:14,600
That's a divine figure in a mythological
story.

1743
01:46:15,770 --> 01:46:20,770
That's what it is.
And so the Christian idea is Christ is 

1744
01:46:20,770 --> 01:46:21,380
the king of kings and that's what it 
means.

1745
01:46:21,530 --> 01:46:25,670
You go into a cathedral and the 
cathedral is across by the way,

1746
01:46:26,220 --> 01:46:30,470
and the cross is the place where 
suffering is accepted and the cross is a

1747
01:46:30,471 --> 01:46:31,200
dome over it.

1748
01:46:31,220 --> 01:46:33,230
Then that's the sky.
Okay?

1749
01:46:33,231 --> 01:46:37,550
So there's an idea in the cathedral and 
the idea is that the place of the cross,

1750
01:46:37,551 --> 01:46:41,060
which is where suffering occurs,
is the center of the universe,

1751
01:46:41,420 --> 01:46:43,640
which is the Dome,
and then you look up at the Dome and you

1752
01:46:43,641 --> 01:46:48,641
see this figure staring down at you.
That's the king of kings and that's how 

1753
01:46:48,801 --> 01:46:53,801
to behave in the world.
That's what that image represents and 

1754
01:46:53,881 --> 01:46:54,600
you think,
well,

1755
01:46:55,290 --> 01:46:56,370
what does it mean?
Well,

1756
01:46:56,371 --> 01:47:01,371
here's a way of unpacking it and this is
associated with its associated with the 

1757
01:47:02,611 --> 01:47:06,420
idea of how to behave across the set of 
all possible hierarchies.

1758
01:47:07,410 --> 01:47:08,310
Well,
what should you do?

1759
01:47:08,580 --> 01:47:09,960
Well,
according to rule one,

1760
01:47:10,530 --> 01:47:12,960
you should stand up straight with your 
shoulders back.

1761
01:47:13,920 --> 01:47:15,930
Okay?
Now the people who have been,

1762
01:47:16,200 --> 01:47:18,660
some of the people who've been 
criticizing me say,

1763
01:47:19,020 --> 01:47:24,020
well,
because I point out that hierarchies 

1764
01:47:24,020 --> 01:47:24,020
exist.

1765
01:47:24,020 --> 01:47:26,210
I'm justifying them.
It's like pointing out that something 

1766
01:47:26,210 --> 01:47:29,781
exists is not the same as justifying it.
It's just pointing out that it exists 

1767
01:47:31,320 --> 01:47:34,200
and pointing it out that it exists 
without justifying.

1768
01:47:34,201 --> 01:47:39,201
It is certainly not saying that the way 
to attain dominance in a hierarchy is 

1769
01:47:39,201 --> 01:47:44,001
through power,
which is the other thing that I've been 

1770
01:47:44,001 --> 01:47:44,070
criticized for,
which is not what I'm saying.

1771
01:47:44,430 --> 01:47:46,370
In fact,
I'm not saying that not.

1772
01:47:46,380 --> 01:47:51,380
I'm not even saying that a little bit.
It's exactly the opposite of what I'm 

1773
01:47:51,380 --> 01:47:51,570
saying.
Say,

1774
01:47:51,571 --> 01:47:56,571
well,
if you stand up straight with your 

1775
01:47:56,571 --> 01:47:56,571
shoulders back,
isn't that a powerful stance?

1776
01:47:56,571 --> 01:47:59,160
And the answer is,
well actually no.

1777
01:48:00,330 --> 01:48:02,520
A powerful stance is this,
right?

1778
01:48:03,180 --> 01:48:08,180
Well,
not really because I'm not very good at 

1779
01:48:08,180 --> 01:48:08,180
it,
but if I knew what I was doing,

1780
01:48:08,180 --> 01:48:12,390
this would be it and I put myself 
sideways so I'm not much of a target and

1781
01:48:12,391 --> 01:48:13,560
I'm ready for attack.

1782
01:48:13,950 --> 01:48:15,750
Okay,
that's not this stance.

1783
01:48:16,590 --> 01:48:18,540
This dance is different.
Right?

1784
01:48:18,810 --> 01:48:22,950
And that that isn't this stance either.
This is a defensive Crouch,

1785
01:48:23,250 --> 01:48:25,590
this is what happens if you're depressed
and anxious,

1786
01:48:25,950 --> 01:48:27,250
right?
This dance is,

1787
01:48:28,200 --> 01:48:31,170
I'm willing to take what the world 
throws at me.

1788
01:48:32,010 --> 01:48:37,010
Right in.
That might be the trials and 

1789
01:48:37,010 --> 01:48:38,931
tribulations that are associated with 
the hierarchy because that's a tough 

1790
01:48:38,931 --> 01:48:42,621
battle in and of itself,
but it also might be all the terrible 

1791
01:48:42,621 --> 01:48:45,981
unknown things that are going to come 
your way and what's the right attitude 

1792
01:48:45,981 --> 01:48:50,090
is stand the hell up with some courage 
and take it right voluntarily with 

1793
01:48:51,541 --> 01:48:56,541
courage.
So it's actually a stance of maximal 

1794
01:48:56,541 --> 01:48:58,980
vulnerability,
vulnerability adopted voluntarily.

1795
01:49:00,090 --> 01:49:02,970
That's what the crucifix represents.
Just so you know,

1796
01:49:03,300 --> 01:49:07,860
it represents the willingness to take on
the suffering of the world voluntarily,

1797
01:49:08,010 --> 01:49:13,010
the whole thing,
and that's associated with what's ever 

1798
01:49:13,010 --> 01:49:13,230
at the top of the hierarchy.

1799
01:49:13,230 --> 01:49:18,230
So the idea is the best possible 
strategy that you have to be successful 

1800
01:49:19,231 --> 01:49:24,231
across the set of all possible 
hierarchies is to maximally accept the 

1801
01:49:24,231 --> 01:49:25,380
fact that your vote,
that you're vulnerable,

1802
01:49:26,430 --> 01:49:30,660
to accept that as the price of being.
And that's the essential message.

1803
01:49:30,810 --> 01:49:32,670
It's not only the message of 
Christianity,

1804
01:49:32,671 --> 01:49:37,671
by the way you see this sort of idea 
expressed in all sorts of religious 

1805
01:49:37,671 --> 01:49:41,190
structures in the daoists to return to 
them say,

1806
01:49:41,191 --> 01:49:45,180
well where should you be in the world?
The world is made out of the catastrophe

1807
01:49:45,181 --> 01:49:49,300
of chaos in the tyranny of order.
Where do you stand in that place?

1808
01:49:49,301 --> 01:49:53,680
And the answer is with one foot in chaos
and one foot in order.

1809
01:49:54,460 --> 01:49:57,160
That's the line down the middle.
That's the Tao.

1810
01:49:57,250 --> 01:49:59,740
That's the way.
That's the point of meaning.

1811
01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:02,620
It's the same place that's at the center
of a cathedral.

1812
01:50:02,920 --> 01:50:03,940
It's the same idea.

1813
01:50:04,600 --> 01:50:09,600
You stand there because you're secure 
because you have tradition and the power

1814
01:50:10,811 --> 01:50:15,811
of your civilization behind you and you 
have one foot in chaos because that's 

1815
01:50:15,811 --> 01:50:20,701
not enough and never will be.
And the instinct that puts you there is 

1816
01:50:20,701 --> 01:50:23,920
the instinct of meaning.
And you can use that as a guide,

1817
01:50:24,160 --> 01:50:28,780
and it's a deep neurological instinct.
It's not some EPA phenomena.

1818
01:50:29,590 --> 01:50:34,590
It's the most real thing there is as far
as I can tell and associated with that 

1819
01:50:34,590 --> 01:50:39,091
is a certain attitude towards life,
which is to venture courageously out 

1820
01:50:39,431 --> 01:50:42,460
into the unknown,
is to put yourself on the line,

1821
01:50:42,490 --> 01:50:44,950
right,
to heed the call of adventure,

1822
01:50:45,250 --> 01:50:50,250
to risk yourself voluntarily.
You have no choice anyways,

1823
01:50:51,700 --> 01:50:54,190
right?
Because you're in this all the way.

1824
01:50:54,570 --> 01:50:56,710
There is no out.
That isn't death.

1825
01:50:58,130 --> 01:51:03,130
The full catastrophe is at your feet.
You can't evade or escape that,

1826
01:51:03,770 --> 01:51:07,790
but what you can do is choose how it is 
that you're going to confront it.

1827
01:51:08,660 --> 01:51:13,660
And so rule one is to stand up straight 
with your shoulders back and to 

1828
01:51:13,660 --> 01:51:17,441
manifest.
And this is the thing that's so amazing 

1829
01:51:17,441 --> 01:51:17,441
about this,
I think,

1830
01:51:17,441 --> 01:51:21,720
and that what lands are kind of ultimate
reality to the idea of positioning 

1831
01:51:22,911 --> 01:51:25,130
yourself properly.
You might say,

1832
01:51:26,450 --> 01:51:31,450
well,
let's presume that you're a very 

1833
01:51:31,450 --> 01:51:34,130
pessimistic person or a very realistic 
person,

1834
01:51:35,690 --> 01:51:36,950
and you say,
well,

1835
01:51:36,951 --> 01:51:39,290
what's the fundamental reality of life?
You say,

1836
01:51:39,291 --> 01:51:42,970
well,
it's suffering and malevolence like,

1837
01:51:42,971 --> 01:51:47,560
okay,
it's a hard argument to forestall,

1838
01:51:48,520 --> 01:51:52,690
but I don't think it's true.
It's true,

1839
01:51:52,691 --> 01:51:54,850
but it's not.
It's not the final truth.

1840
01:51:55,600 --> 01:51:59,260
The final truth is,
despite the fact that that's true,

1841
01:51:59,980 --> 01:52:04,980
the ability of the human spirit to 
prevail is more powerful than death and 

1842
01:52:05,051 --> 01:52:05,440
evil.

1843
01:52:09,600 --> 01:52:12,990
That's the truth,
and you know that you know that.

1844
01:52:12,991 --> 01:52:17,991
First of all,
you know that because you're ashamed 

1845
01:52:17,991 --> 01:52:20,750
that you're not everything you could be.
You know that because the people that 

1846
01:52:20,750 --> 01:52:25,101
you admire are people who manifest 
courage in the diarist of straights and 

1847
01:52:26,011 --> 01:52:31,011
you know that as well because when you 
meet people like that and you're not 

1848
01:52:31,011 --> 01:52:31,350
like that,
they shame you.

1849
01:52:32,360 --> 01:52:34,650
That speaks to your deepest possible 
instinct.

1850
01:52:34,651 --> 01:52:39,651
You know what you could be and you know 
too that you see people contend with 

1851
01:52:39,651 --> 01:52:44,151
situations that are so difficult that 
it's truly a miracle that they can 

1852
01:52:44,151 --> 01:52:44,850
contend with them.
You know,

1853
01:52:44,851 --> 01:52:46,130
when I of people,
well,

1854
01:52:46,131 --> 01:52:47,960
I think the people who work in funeral 
homes,

1855
01:52:47,961 --> 01:52:50,090
that's a good example.
That's hard,

1856
01:52:50,960 --> 01:52:55,960
right?
That's death and grief every day and 

1857
01:52:55,960 --> 01:52:57,980
it's not something that you can avoid.
It's like it's right there.

1858
01:52:57,981 --> 01:52:59,570
It's as real as it can possibly be.

1859
01:52:59,840 --> 01:53:04,840
I'll tell you a story about that.
I had a client who was very afraid of 

1860
01:53:05,541 --> 01:53:10,541
being alive and she wanted to sleep all 
the time and she took sleeping pills and

1861
01:53:11,811 --> 01:53:16,811
all sorts of other things so that she 
could evade the burden of being 

1862
01:53:16,811 --> 01:53:20,201
conscious and she was a very good 
dreamer and she she wasn't doing well in

1863
01:53:21,501 --> 01:53:26,501
university and she had a dream one night
that Gypsy told her that she was 

1864
01:53:27,501 --> 01:53:29,450
actually lucid during her dreams by the 
way,

1865
01:53:29,451 --> 01:53:33,500
and she could ask her dream characters 
what they meant and they would tell her,

1866
01:53:33,650 --> 01:53:36,320
which was something I'd never seen 
anyone else manage.

1867
01:53:36,740 --> 01:53:39,950
In any case,
she jumped up this gypsy that she met in

1868
01:53:39,951 --> 01:53:42,320
the forest and the Gypsy told her that 
unless she learned to,

1869
01:53:42,980 --> 01:53:44,900
unless she could learn to work in a 
slaughter house,

1870
01:53:44,901 --> 01:53:48,770
she'd never finished her degree.
And so she told me that story.

1871
01:53:49,110 --> 01:53:52,670
I don't know if you know this,
but the classic treatment for people who

1872
01:53:52,671 --> 01:53:56,330
are afraid of things is to expose them 
to what they're afraid of.

1873
01:53:56,840 --> 01:54:01,840
Which is a good lesson.
If you have children because he wanted 

1874
01:54:01,840 --> 01:54:03,200
expose your children to challenges 
because that makes them stronger,

1875
01:54:03,410 --> 01:54:08,410
it has to be done voluntarily,
but if you have posttraumatic stress 

1876
01:54:08,410 --> 01:54:09,890
disorder,
let's say you're the victim of a vicious

1877
01:54:09,950 --> 01:54:13,040
sexual assault by a stranger until years
later,

1878
01:54:13,041 --> 01:54:18,041
you have posttraumatic stress disorder.
The most effective treatment is to get 

1879
01:54:18,041 --> 01:54:22,211
you to relive the experience in is much 
vivid detail as you possibly can and 

1880
01:54:22,211 --> 01:54:24,290
experience all the emotions that 
occurred while it was happening,

1881
01:54:25,100 --> 01:54:26,810
and if the.
If you do that,

1882
01:54:26,811 --> 01:54:30,020
the more upset you get when you do that.
If you do it voluntarily,

1883
01:54:30,021 --> 01:54:32,720
the faster you get better and the longer
you stay better.

1884
01:54:33,500 --> 01:54:38,500
And so it's a general rule of thumb in 
psychotherapy is if someone's avoiding 

1885
01:54:38,500 --> 01:54:39,380
something,
find out what they're avoiding,

1886
01:54:40,100 --> 01:54:44,720
break it into manageable pieces and have
them voluntarily expose themselves to it

1887
01:54:44,840 --> 01:54:46,640
and they they will be cured.

1888
01:54:46,940 --> 01:54:48,530
And that's the dragon.
Fight in,

1889
01:54:48,650 --> 01:54:53,300
in clinical practice,
find what you most want to what you most

1890
01:54:53,301 --> 01:54:56,660
need will be found where you least want 
to look right?

1891
01:54:56,690 --> 01:55:01,690
That's a hell of a statement.
So she told me this dream and I thought,

1892
01:55:02,780 --> 01:55:07,780
well,
I don't know how to arrange for you to 

1893
01:55:07,780 --> 01:55:09,080
work in a slaughterhouse that doesn't 
seem like a very.

1894
01:55:09,380 --> 01:55:12,320
She wouldn't eat meat by the way.
She wouldn't go into a butcher store.

1895
01:55:12,470 --> 01:55:16,820
I took her into a butcher store once and
she had a very catastrophic reaction.

1896
01:55:16,821 --> 01:55:20,870
She couldn't handle it anyways.
I said,

1897
01:55:20,871 --> 01:55:22,880
well,
we can arrange the slaughterhouse thing,

1898
01:55:22,881 --> 01:55:27,881
why don't you go away and for awhile and
come back in a week and see if you can 

1899
01:55:27,881 --> 01:55:29,480
come up with an alternative.
So,

1900
01:55:29,481 --> 01:55:31,430
uh,
she came back and she said,

1901
01:55:31,700 --> 01:55:34,790
I want to see an embalming.
And I thought,

1902
01:55:34,820 --> 01:55:36,560
Oh God,
okay,

1903
01:55:36,590 --> 01:55:38,330
how the hell am I going to arrange that?

1904
01:55:38,840 --> 01:55:40,910
So I phoned a couple of funeral homes 
and I said,

1905
01:55:40,911 --> 01:55:43,200
look,
I've got this person who's really afraid

1906
01:55:43,201 --> 01:55:48,201
of death and she had this dream and I 
told them the story and they said,

1907
01:55:48,330 --> 01:55:50,370
no problem,
bring her in.

1908
01:55:50,720 --> 01:55:54,120
And so I wasn't looking forward to this 
by the way.

1909
01:55:54,730 --> 01:55:57,750
Um,
so we went and she was very,

1910
01:55:57,751 --> 01:56:00,930
very nervous because she certainly 
didn't think she could handle that.

1911
01:56:01,350 --> 01:56:06,350
And as I said already,
I wasn't exactly thrilled about it 

1912
01:56:06,350 --> 01:56:06,350
either,
but in,

1913
01:56:06,350 --> 01:56:07,140
for a pound in,
for a penny in,

1914
01:56:07,141 --> 01:56:09,060
for a pound as they say.
So anyways,

1915
01:56:09,061 --> 01:56:13,350
we went to the funeral parlor and they 
showed us around and we asked a bunch of

1916
01:56:13,351 --> 01:56:18,351
questions like,
how the hell did they cope with their 

1917
01:56:18,351 --> 01:56:18,351
jobs because that's just a mystery to 
me.

1918
01:56:18,351 --> 01:56:18,600
And they said,
well,

1919
01:56:18,601 --> 01:56:23,601
it was actually really useful for them 
to guide people through the process of 

1920
01:56:23,601 --> 01:56:26,811
grief and that their experience was that
that had given them a renewed 

1921
01:56:26,811 --> 01:56:30,501
appreciation for life,
which is well that would account for why

1922
01:56:30,961 --> 01:56:33,570
they were able to do it because it seems
like a very hard job.

1923
01:56:33,570 --> 01:56:38,570
And so we went into this room and watch 
this embalming and I was about eight 

1924
01:56:40,201 --> 01:56:45,201
feet away from this small room.
It's a pretty gruesome operation as you 

1925
01:56:45,201 --> 01:56:45,201
might imagine.
And uh,

1926
01:56:45,201 --> 01:56:50,150
my client was sitting beside me and I 
was watching her and watching the 

1927
01:56:50,150 --> 01:56:53,471
embalming as well.
And for the first while she was just 

1928
01:56:53,471 --> 01:56:53,880
looking to the side,
which was,

1929
01:56:53,881 --> 01:56:56,700
I'm not here and I certainly can't 
handle that.

1930
01:56:56,820 --> 01:57:00,090
And no bloody wonder.
Literally and so,

1931
01:57:00,091 --> 01:57:05,091
but then she would take the odd glance,
say she'd go like this and then look 

1932
01:57:05,091 --> 01:57:08,340
away and then as the minutes ticked by,
but fairly rapidly,

1933
01:57:08,580 --> 01:57:13,580
she was spending more time watching and 
less time looking away until she was 

1934
01:57:13,580 --> 01:57:17,781
finally doing nothing but watching.
And then at some point she asked if she 

1935
01:57:17,781 --> 01:57:18,780
could come in and,
and put her hand on the body.

1936
01:57:18,840 --> 01:57:23,840
And so they gave her a glove and she did
that and then she went and sat down and 

1937
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:27,030
she was quite quiet about all this and 
quite quiet afterwards and well.

1938
01:57:27,060 --> 01:57:30,210
So what did she discover?
Well,

1939
01:57:30,211 --> 01:57:33,000
she didn't discover the death was,
wasn't horrible.

1940
01:57:34,110 --> 01:57:39,110
She didn't discover that and she didn't 
discover the death wasn't terrifying 

1941
01:57:39,110 --> 01:57:43,850
because it certainly was.
But what she did discover was that she 

1942
01:57:43,850 --> 01:57:44,820
was a hell of a lot tougher than she 
thought and,

1943
01:57:44,870 --> 01:57:47,670
and much quicker than she would have 
believed.

1944
01:57:47,910 --> 01:57:50,850
And she went away thinking,
Huh,

1945
01:57:52,590 --> 01:57:57,590
look at that.
I did the thing I was most afraid of 

1946
01:57:57,590 --> 01:57:58,110
doing.
And here I am.

1947
01:57:59,130 --> 01:58:02,370
Not only am I not more damaged than I 
was,

1948
01:58:02,640 --> 01:58:05,880
I'm actually better than I was.
And so from then on,

1949
01:58:05,881 --> 01:58:08,370
she had a reference point,
right?

1950
01:58:08,700 --> 01:58:13,700
Which is an interesting thing.
I think this is why primordial people 

1951
01:58:13,700 --> 01:58:14,790
initiate their,
especially their young men,

1952
01:58:14,791 --> 01:58:16,860
because it sort of happens automatically
with young women.

1953
01:58:17,250 --> 01:58:19,860
They exposed their young men to 
something absolutely terrifying,

1954
01:58:20,190 --> 01:58:23,430
genuinely terrifying,
so that for the rest of their lives,

1955
01:58:23,431 --> 01:58:27,480
they know the difference between what's 
actually terrifying and what's just sort

1956
01:58:27,481 --> 01:58:30,690
of normal catastrophe because you really
need to know that,

1957
01:58:30,720 --> 01:58:35,720
right?
Because you need to know that you can 

1958
01:58:35,720 --> 01:58:37,581
prevail.
And one of the things she learned as a 

1959
01:58:37,581 --> 01:58:39,741
consequence of that exposure was that 
she could prevail despite the realities 

1960
01:58:40,921 --> 01:58:42,130
of life.
Of course,

1961
01:58:42,131 --> 01:58:45,340
that's what you want to teach your 
children mostly by example,

1962
01:58:45,910 --> 01:58:49,690
is that they can prevail despite the 
realities of life.

1963
01:58:49,990 --> 01:58:54,990
Of course,
that also means that you have to have 

1964
01:58:54,990 --> 01:58:54,990
admitted to what the realities of life 
are.

1965
01:58:54,990 --> 01:58:56,260
But the thing that's so interesting 
about that.

1966
01:58:56,740 --> 01:59:00,850
Here's another story.
So you know the story of King Arthur and

1967
01:59:00,851 --> 01:59:01,600
the holy grail.

1968
01:59:03,850 --> 01:59:08,850
The holy grail is the ultimate value 
that it's a symbol of whatever the 

1969
01:59:08,850 --> 01:59:12,511
ultimate value is.
And King Arthur assembles is nights 

1970
01:59:12,511 --> 01:59:14,800
around the round table and it's a round 
table because they're all equal,

1971
01:59:15,220 --> 01:59:20,220
despite the fact that they have a king,
they sit as equals at the round table 

1972
01:59:20,220 --> 01:59:21,760
and they all decided to go off to seek 
for the holy grail.

1973
01:59:22,990 --> 01:59:26,260
It's either the cup that Christ drank 
out of at the last supper,

1974
01:59:26,261 --> 01:59:28,090
the cup that held his blood on the 
cross.

1975
01:59:28,120 --> 01:59:30,220
It's one of those two things.
It doesn't really matter.

1976
01:59:30,221 --> 01:59:34,210
It's a symbol of what's redemptive.
That's what the holy grail is.

1977
01:59:34,720 --> 01:59:37,000
So it's a representation of the ultimate
value.

1978
01:59:37,690 --> 01:59:42,690
The question is where do you go to seek 
out what's of ultimate value and answer 

1979
01:59:42,691 --> 01:59:47,691
in the in the tail of of King Arthur and
the holy grail is that each night 

1980
01:59:47,691 --> 01:59:52,201
entered the forest when they began their
search at the place that looks darkest 

1981
01:59:52,201 --> 01:59:52,240
to them.

1982
01:59:54,390 --> 01:59:59,390
So that's the thing is that it's 
necessary if you're going to stand up 

1983
01:59:59,390 --> 02:00:04,340
straight with your shoulders back to 
confront the darkness of the world,

1984
02:00:04,741 --> 02:00:09,741
head on,
to take responsibility for the tragedy 

1985
02:00:09,741 --> 02:00:12,570
of existence and for for malevolence,
that's what it means.

1986
02:00:12,870 --> 02:00:17,870
That's the what the Christian injunction
to take the sins of the world onto 

1987
02:00:17,870 --> 02:00:19,560
yourself means it means it's your bloody
problem,

1988
02:00:19,950 --> 02:00:22,770
and to confront Satan in the desert is 
the same idea,

1989
02:00:23,130 --> 02:00:27,000
is that not only do you have to take on 
the tragedy of the world as if it's your

1990
02:00:27,001 --> 02:00:32,001
responsibility,
but you have to contend with the spirit 

1991
02:00:32,001 --> 02:00:33,360
of malevolence while you're doing so,
and it's in doing that,

1992
02:00:33,361 --> 02:00:38,361
that you find your destiny.
That's where you find the highest of 

1993
02:00:38,361 --> 02:00:39,420
possible values,
and that's the call.

1994
02:00:39,900 --> 02:00:42,660
That's the call to the nobility of being
because you might think,

1995
02:00:42,661 --> 02:00:47,661
well,
what could possibly justify your life 

1996
02:00:47,661 --> 02:00:50,450
more thoroughly?
What could make you the best player of 

1997
02:00:50,450 --> 02:00:53,421
all possible games than to take the 
tragedy of the world onto your 

1998
02:00:54,511 --> 02:00:59,511
shoulders,
to fight with all your ability against 

1999
02:01:00,121 --> 02:01:04,920
the malevolence in your own heart.
Thank you.

2000
02:01:15,760 --> 02:01:19,750
The first one I'll choose here.
Thank you for coming to speak with us.

2001
02:01:19,810 --> 02:01:21,130
What do you think of Iceland?

2002
02:01:29,440 --> 02:01:31,570
Well,
first of all,

2003
02:01:31,930 --> 02:01:36,930
thank you all for coming.
It's quite remarkable to see so many 

2004
02:01:36,930 --> 02:01:39,190
people come out for such a serious 
conversation.

2005
02:01:39,320 --> 02:01:40,370
It isn't exactly

2006
02:01:40,370 --> 02:01:45,370
what you'd expect.
So everyone has been ridiculously 

2007
02:01:46,041 --> 02:01:49,040
hospitable to me and my family.
Um,

2008
02:01:50,120 --> 02:01:52,520
we've seen some beautiful things.
We were at the blue lagoon,

2009
02:01:52,521 --> 02:01:57,521
which was very impressive.
We went to the house today where 

2010
02:01:57,521 --> 02:02:00,431
Gorbachev and Reagan met in 1986 and 
that was very interesting.

2011
02:02:00,771 --> 02:02:04,730
I went and saw some rare manuscripts at 
the university this morning,

2012
02:02:05,170 --> 02:02:10,170
a goon lager and his crew of people have
been very organized and you have a 

2013
02:02:12,111 --> 02:02:17,111
beautiful little capital city that's 
extraordinarily impressive and you've 

2014
02:02:17,211 --> 02:02:22,211
produced this amazing venue and your 
country is cruising along on all 

2015
02:02:22,761 --> 02:02:25,790
cylinders and it's a hell of an 
achievement.

2016
02:02:26,480 --> 02:02:27,850
So that's what I think.
I,

2017
02:02:27,851 --> 02:02:30,830
I think that almost all the time when I 
come to a European country,

2018
02:02:33,260 --> 02:02:35,090
it's amazing how well it works.
I mean,

2019
02:02:35,091 --> 02:02:36,380
this is a harsh place,
you know,

2020
02:02:36,560 --> 02:02:41,560
it's,
you made a lot of what you have and it 

2021
02:02:41,560 --> 02:02:45,491
looks to me like it's just getting 
better and so it's peaceful and 

2022
02:02:45,491 --> 02:02:49,031
productive and civilized and beautiful 
and hospitable and good for you.

2023
02:02:53,480 --> 02:02:54,890
And thank you for inviting me.

2024
02:02:59,500 --> 02:03:04,500
This one.
The next one is regarding the hit pieces

2025
02:03:06,190 --> 02:03:07,580
on you.
Um,

2026
02:03:08,080 --> 02:03:13,080
when such an article is written,
what is your interpretation of the costs

2027
02:03:14,500 --> 02:03:19,500
or further what potential explanations 
are there for this phenomenon?

2028
02:03:21,750 --> 02:03:22,770
Well,
I think there's,

2029
02:03:23,640 --> 02:03:28,640
you know,
we could start with what I might be 

2030
02:03:28,640 --> 02:03:30,981
contributing to it now.
One thing I've had to learn,

2031
02:03:36,591 --> 02:03:41,591
I've had some interactions with public 
exposure for probably 15 years because I

2032
02:03:46,010 --> 02:03:50,840
worked a little bit with a public 
television station in Ontario before all

2033
02:03:50,841 --> 02:03:55,841
this blew up.
My producer who was someone who was very

2034
02:03:59,051 --> 02:04:04,051
much on my side.
So I worked for a public affairs show 

2035
02:04:04,051 --> 02:04:07,590
first of all,
as a regular panelist and then as a 

2036
02:04:07,590 --> 02:04:07,810
columnist for a couple of years,

2037
02:04:10,570 --> 02:04:12,730
my producer,
who's a level headed guy,

2038
02:04:14,350 --> 02:04:17,740
well versed in what worked well in panel
discussions,

2039
02:04:18,960 --> 02:04:23,960
told me to be very careful about 
controlling my proclivity towards anger 

2040
02:04:26,350 --> 02:04:28,330
because it doesn't play very well 
publicly.

2041
02:04:29,530 --> 02:04:34,530
And so now I kept trying to learn the 
doctrine of minimal necessary force.

2042
02:04:35,861 --> 02:04:40,861
I mean,
I that aggression is a good thing if 

2043
02:04:40,861 --> 02:04:42,870
it's controlled.
I think it's a good antidote to fear.

2044
02:04:43,110 --> 02:04:48,110
I think it's one of the things that can 
help you maintain your ground in the 

2045
02:04:48,110 --> 02:04:50,610
face of resistance,
but it has to be applied very,

2046
02:04:50,611 --> 02:04:55,611
very judiciously and it isn't obvious 
that I always do that as well as I might

2047
02:04:57,060 --> 02:05:02,060
and if you're going to deal with 
difficult and dangerous and contentious 

2048
02:05:02,060 --> 02:05:06,591
issues,
then you're going to get punished for 

2049
02:05:06,591 --> 02:05:08,700
your failures.
And so I'm trying to learn too.

2050
02:05:09,190 --> 02:05:09,400
Okay.

2051
02:05:10,910 --> 02:05:13,550
Detach myself and to not,
not in a,

2052
02:05:13,970 --> 02:05:16,810
not in an I don't care way,
no,

2053
02:05:16,820 --> 02:05:21,820
but in a watchful way and to keep all of
that under control as much as possible 

2054
02:05:22,281 --> 02:05:27,260
and to use minimal necessary force and 
it's hard to learn to do that well.

2055
02:05:27,860 --> 02:05:30,440
And so to the degree that I don't do 
that,

2056
02:05:30,800 --> 02:05:35,360
then I instigate more opposition than I 
might.

2057
02:05:36,560 --> 02:05:41,560
Now.
I have hard time with that to some 

2058
02:05:41,560 --> 02:05:42,440
degree because I do find some of what I 
have been,

2059
02:05:43,280 --> 02:05:46,690
let's say opposing,
um,

2060
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:55,890
what would you say I'm.
It makes me deeply.

2061
02:05:56,480 --> 02:05:59,550
It disturbs me deeply and makes me 
unhappy and ashamed.

2062
02:06:01,250 --> 02:06:04,520
That's particularly the case when I see 
what's happening at the universities.

2063
02:06:05,660 --> 02:06:10,430
I'm not impressed by what's happening in
the social sciences and the humanities.

2064
02:06:10,700 --> 02:06:12,710
I'm not impressed with the 
postmodernists.

2065
02:06:13,550 --> 02:06:18,550
I'm not impressed with the Marxists and 
I'm certainly not impressed with the 

2066
02:06:18,550 --> 02:06:21,860
people or the theories that juxtapose 
the two in this particularly

2067
02:06:23,310 --> 02:06:28,310
ideological brew that's been fermenting 
say since the 19 sixties and so it's not

2068
02:06:30,151 --> 02:06:32,790
easy to maintain equanimity in the face 
of that,

2069
02:06:32,791 --> 02:06:35,370
but it doesn't matter because it's still
necessary.

2070
02:06:36,090 --> 02:06:41,090
Do you think their ideology has 
permeated all of media or because not 

2071
02:06:43,501 --> 02:06:44,340
all of it?
Yeah,

2072
02:06:44,550 --> 02:06:48,360
I mean that's the other thing is that,
and this is why dealing now,

2073
02:06:49,020 --> 02:06:51,390
now we can turn to what the media might 
bring to this.

2074
02:06:51,391 --> 02:06:52,860
Well,
ideological,

2075
02:06:53,310 --> 02:06:58,310
ideological pre commitments.
That's certainly the case and inability 

2076
02:06:58,310 --> 02:07:01,740
to see anything other than in 
politicized terms.

2077
02:07:01,741 --> 02:07:06,320
Like I don't view that what I'm doing as
fundamentally political action.

2078
02:07:06,330 --> 02:07:09,900
In fact,
I don't view the battle that's raging in

2079
02:07:09,901 --> 02:07:13,440
the ideational substructure over society
is fundamentally political.

2080
02:07:13,441 --> 02:07:18,441
I think it's deeper than political.
It's at least philosophical and it's 

2081
02:07:18,441 --> 02:07:22,401
probably theological,
but the but the people who've been 

2082
02:07:22,891 --> 02:07:25,740
pillaring me,
let's say who tend to be the postmodern,

2083
02:07:25,741 --> 02:07:30,741
neo Marxist types,
or at least leaning that direction 

2084
02:07:30,741 --> 02:07:33,450
cannot conceptualize anything that isn't
political in their world.

2085
02:07:33,450 --> 02:07:35,160
There isn't anything that isn't 
political.

2086
02:07:35,380 --> 02:07:37,720
One of the things that you might 
consider,

2087
02:07:37,721 --> 02:07:39,600
for example,
is you know,

2088
02:07:40,930 --> 02:07:45,930
I've been perhaps represented as an as 
an advocate of free speech,

2089
02:07:48,281 --> 02:07:53,281
and of course there's a lot of debate 
about what free speech really is from 

2090
02:07:54,190 --> 02:07:59,190
the radical leftist types and here's 
something that you have to understand 

2091
02:07:59,190 --> 02:08:03,160
from the collectivist perspective that 
dominates the radical left.

2092
02:08:03,460 --> 02:08:08,460
There is no such thing as free speech.
It's not that they oppose it,

2093
02:08:10,210 --> 02:08:14,230
it's that it isn't a move in their game.
It doesn't exist.

2094
02:08:14,530 --> 02:08:19,530
So if you stand up and say,
I'm manifesting my opinion as an 

2095
02:08:19,530 --> 02:08:24,301
individual,
then that's not a acceptable move 

2096
02:08:25,120 --> 02:08:30,120
because you aren't an individual.
You're an Avatar of your dominant group 

2097
02:08:32,620 --> 02:08:37,620
and whatever you otter,
regardless of why you think you're 

2098
02:08:37,620 --> 02:08:41,371
honoring it or regardless of whether you
think it's your individual opinion is 

2099
02:08:41,441 --> 02:08:46,441
nothing but a power move in your 
dominance hierarchy and so it's not like

2100
02:08:46,721 --> 02:08:47,950
they oppose free speech.

2101
02:08:47,950 --> 02:08:52,950
It's that it doesn't exist in their 
conceptual framework and so that's one 

2102
02:08:52,950 --> 02:08:57,601
of the things that drives and they hit 
pieces because I do believe in the 

2103
02:08:58,301 --> 02:09:03,301
individual and I do believe in free 
speech and I do believe in a world 

2104
02:09:03,301 --> 02:09:07,951
outside the conceptual realm,
all sorts of propositions that aren't 

2105
02:09:08,321 --> 02:09:13,321
part and parcel of the postmodernist 
slash neo Marxist game and they're not 

2106
02:09:13,871 --> 02:09:15,440
very happy with that.
It's.

2107
02:09:15,710 --> 02:09:20,710
I'm not playing by the rules and so they
don't know what to do about that.

2108
02:09:21,370 --> 02:09:24,490
The simplest thing to do is to call me 
far right,

2109
02:09:24,491 --> 02:09:28,300
are all right because then they can.
First of all,

2110
02:09:28,330 --> 02:09:30,730
that's an evil category and that 
dispenses with that,

2111
02:09:30,731 --> 02:09:35,731
but it also means they don't have to 
contend with any of my arguments and 

2112
02:09:35,731 --> 02:09:39,241
that's convenient,
so it's easier to demonize than it is to

2113
02:09:40,600 --> 02:09:45,600
contend.
So it doesn't seem to help them because 

2114
02:09:45,600 --> 02:09:50,340
the more they scream,
the more people that actually listened 

2115
02:09:50,340 --> 02:09:50,710
to you here,
that you're not far right,

2116
02:09:51,070 --> 02:09:52,100
you're not all thrive.

2117
02:09:52,150 --> 02:09:54,910
And they stopped believing them.
Well,

2118
02:09:54,940 --> 02:09:59,940
that's the other thing.
I've talked with my wife about this 

2119
02:09:59,940 --> 02:10:02,581
because it's been in Vr.
It's produced a lot of tension in our 

2120
02:10:02,581 --> 02:10:05,950
family because it's very stressful.
I mean for all sorts of reasons,

2121
02:10:05,951 --> 02:10:07,780
but that's certainly one of them,
you know,

2122
02:10:07,781 --> 02:10:12,781
I mean,
it's certainly not the case that when I 

2123
02:10:12,781 --> 02:10:14,911
read a headpiece that I'm very pleased 
about it and I'm often quite worried 

2124
02:10:16,181 --> 02:10:18,310
about it.
Like the New York Times piece,

2125
02:10:18,311 --> 02:10:21,220
for example,
is a good example and it's idiot.

2126
02:10:22,570 --> 02:10:24,070
What would you call it?
Um,

2127
02:10:24,580 --> 02:10:28,310
insistence that I was promoting,
you know,

2128
02:10:28,660 --> 02:10:33,660
monogamy with the weapons of the state 
of all the insane ideas.

2129
02:10:34,071 --> 02:10:39,071
I mean,
who the hell believes that it's like 

2130
02:10:39,071 --> 02:10:40,190
some isis guys.
That's about it.

2131
02:10:40,280 --> 02:10:45,280
So it's a completely absurd accusation 
and it certainly bore no resemblance to 

2132
02:10:46,401 --> 02:10:49,040
anything that I meant.
But you know,

2133
02:10:49,041 --> 02:10:54,041
it's a powerful media organization and 
lots of people warned me in the 

2134
02:10:54,041 --> 02:10:58,931
immediate aftermath of that.
It would be my downfall and including 

2135
02:10:58,931 --> 02:11:02,261
people who were less,
they weren't fearful people and so it's 

2136
02:11:02,261 --> 02:11:05,180
very stressful.
So one question is,

2137
02:11:05,181 --> 02:11:10,181
well,
should I be doing interviews like that 

2138
02:11:10,181 --> 02:11:12,011
at all?
Because one of the things I've thought 

2139
02:11:12,011 --> 02:11:12,080
is no written interviews only live 
interviews,

2140
02:11:12,410 --> 02:11:16,940
only the whole thing.
So the one today you had the last one.

2141
02:11:17,120 --> 02:11:22,120
Well see,
I don't know because there's another 

2142
02:11:22,120 --> 02:11:22,340
side of it which is the side you laid 
out.

2143
02:11:22,341 --> 02:11:27,341
It's like this happened with the.
Some of you have seen the channel for 

2144
02:11:27,341 --> 02:11:29,180
interview that I did with Kathy Newman

2145
02:11:30,520 --> 02:11:35,520
and thank you.

2146
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:43,000
You know when that was,
I would say that was a stressful 

2147
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,641
interview and I would say that the two 
weeks after the interview we're also 

2148
02:11:45,641 --> 02:11:48,610
very stressful because,
you know,

2149
02:11:48,740 --> 02:11:53,740
first of all there was the interview and
I thought they'd just cut it to seven 

2150
02:11:53,740 --> 02:11:54,440
minutes and pillory me and leave it at 
that,

2151
02:11:55,400 --> 02:12:00,400
but they cut it to seven minutes and 
pilloried me and then they posted the 

2152
02:12:00,400 --> 02:12:01,190
whole interview,
which just shocked me.

2153
02:12:01,460 --> 02:12:06,460
But here's the shocking thing.
The people who posted that interview 

2154
02:12:06,460 --> 02:12:10,460
thought it went well.
That's why they posted it.

2155
02:12:10,490 --> 02:12:11,630
They didn't think,
oh my God,

2156
02:12:11,631 --> 02:12:13,280
this is contentious.
We better put it out,

2157
02:12:13,281 --> 02:12:18,281
believe me.
They didn't think that that is not what 

2158
02:12:18,281 --> 02:12:20,351
they thought.
They thought it went fine and so then 

2159
02:12:20,351 --> 02:12:22,781
there was this overwhelming response to 
it and that was completely unexpected 

2160
02:12:22,781 --> 02:12:27,370
and then the counter response was 
Peterson's army of alt right trolls is 

2161
02:12:27,591 --> 02:12:31,160
victimizing Kathy Newman,
and that was.

2162
02:12:31,640 --> 02:12:34,880
That was the response of her employers,
the technical response,

2163
02:12:34,881 --> 02:12:39,881
because that's what they publish.
They said we had to call him police to 

2164
02:12:39,881 --> 02:12:39,881
evaluate the threat.
It's like,

2165
02:12:40,430 --> 02:12:45,430
well,
so what anybody can call in police to 

2166
02:12:45,430 --> 02:12:48,461
evaluate a threat.
It doesn't mean that the threat 

2167
02:12:48,461 --> 02:12:48,920
justified police intervention or that 
there was a threat.

2168
02:12:49,370 --> 02:12:54,370
It just meant that that's how you 
responded to it and then they spun a 

2169
02:12:54,370 --> 02:12:56,300
victim narrative for Kathy,
which was I think reprehensible.

2170
02:12:56,301 --> 02:13:01,301
Given that.
I don't know what Kathy Newman is 

2171
02:13:01,301 --> 02:13:01,370
exactly,
but she's not a bloody victim.

2172
02:13:01,610 --> 02:13:06,610
She's not powerless.
She's one of the most powerful women in 

2173
02:13:06,610 --> 02:13:08,210
the United Kingdom and she has a salary 
that's commensurate with that and good,

2174
02:13:08,390 --> 02:13:10,070
good for her.
That's absolutely fine,

2175
02:13:10,220 --> 02:13:12,470
but you don't get to have that and also 
be a victim.

2176
02:13:12,890 --> 02:13:17,890
It's not the right way to play the game.
And so then a whole bunch of newspapers 

2177
02:13:18,560 --> 02:13:22,750
laid out the story that poor Kathy was 
being trolled by my,

2178
02:13:22,880 --> 02:13:25,790
my legion of all right,
angry people,

2179
02:13:26,390 --> 02:13:29,020
but then the numbers started to mount,
you know,

2180
02:13:29,060 --> 02:13:34,060
and after it was like 4 million people,
it got the whole troll argument got hard

2181
02:13:34,201 --> 02:13:36,180
to sustain unless you think there are 
like,

2182
02:13:36,780 --> 02:13:41,780
well now it's perhaps 30 million people 
have watched either the whole thing or 

2183
02:13:41,780 --> 02:13:42,000
major clips from it.

2184
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:47,000
Maybe it's more than that.
It's hard to sustain the old troll 

2185
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:48,180
argument when it's 30 million people,
but it was very.

2186
02:13:48,270 --> 02:13:51,330
I thought that narrative was going to 
prevail for a while that you know,

2187
02:13:51,600 --> 02:13:56,600
oh,
she got victimized and it was all these 

2188
02:13:56,600 --> 02:13:56,700
terrible people that went after her.
But that collapsed.

2189
02:13:57,030 --> 02:13:59,070
But it's very stressful.
But,

2190
02:14:00,640 --> 02:14:02,530
and this is something that I've,
I've learned.

2191
02:14:02,590 --> 02:14:06,580
So I've been obsessing about another 
statement in the New Testament for about

2192
02:14:06,581 --> 02:14:11,581
two years.
I've been trying to figure it out and 

2193
02:14:11,581 --> 02:14:13,471
it's.
It's the statement that you should turn 

2194
02:14:13,471 --> 02:14:13,471
the other cheek and that's a tough one,
man,

2195
02:14:13,471 --> 02:14:14,620
because.
Well,

2196
02:14:14,621 --> 02:14:16,570
because first of all,
who wants to do that?

2197
02:14:16,720 --> 02:14:19,210
Because you want to explode in righteous
anger.

2198
02:14:19,211 --> 02:14:22,600
At least you want to defend yourself.
You want to do one of those things,

2199
02:14:23,200 --> 02:14:28,200
so what the hell does that mean?
And partly what it means is if you're 

2200
02:14:32,040 --> 02:14:36,470
attacked and you're innocent and and 
look,

2201
02:14:36,471 --> 02:14:39,500
I'm not saying I'm like globally 
innocent or anything like that,

2202
02:14:40,490 --> 02:14:45,490
but I'm not guilty of the accusations 
that are levied at me or at least I not 

2203
02:14:46,190 --> 02:14:50,600
guilty in the manner that the 
accusations would indicate.

2204
02:14:52,270 --> 02:14:56,410
If you're being attacked and you're not 
guilty of the accusations,

2205
02:14:56,411 --> 02:14:57,910
then the attacks

2206
02:14:59,850 --> 02:15:04,320
say more about the attacker then their 
intended target.

2207
02:15:05,670 --> 02:15:10,670
And so so far I've been able to 
withstand the attacks and the 

2208
02:15:10,670 --> 02:15:15,021
consequence of that is that it said more
about the attackers then about meat and 

2209
02:15:15,421 --> 02:15:17,580
then the question is can I tolerate 
that?

2210
02:15:18,120 --> 02:15:23,120
Because it's still very stressful and I 
vary our waiver on that back and forth.

2211
02:15:26,630 --> 02:15:31,630
And then of course,
the other issue is is that some people 

2212
02:15:31,630 --> 02:15:35,261
in the media have pilloried me,
but many haven't been very many 

2213
02:15:35,261 --> 02:15:37,850
thoughtful people that have written 
thoughtful pieces about me.

2214
02:15:38,060 --> 02:15:41,090
There's a Canadian consortium of 200 
newspapers,

2215
02:15:41,330 --> 02:15:44,000
the post media group,
and they came out.

2216
02:15:44,060 --> 02:15:49,060
The entire group came out in favor of my
stance in relationship to build 

2217
02:15:49,060 --> 02:15:51,020
[inaudible] in Canada,
which was a speech,

2218
02:15:51,021 --> 02:15:54,490
a speech piece of legislation that 
compelled speech and so

2219
02:15:57,620 --> 02:15:58,760
well.
So,

2220
02:16:00,190 --> 02:16:05,190
so far in same with the protests.
When people come out to protest against 

2221
02:16:05,190 --> 02:16:09,541
me.
The first video that really went viral 

2222
02:16:09,541 --> 02:16:11,521
was a protest at the University of 
Toronto and after the protest was over 

2223
02:16:12,590 --> 02:16:13,950
the the pro,
the,

2224
02:16:14,080 --> 02:16:19,080
the anti free speech,
people at the protests took the 

2225
02:16:19,080 --> 02:16:20,350
microphone away in and blasted white 
noise.

2226
02:16:20,351 --> 02:16:24,130
Made it impossible for anyone to speak 
even though it was an open mic event.

2227
02:16:26,250 --> 02:16:30,070
So that got broadcast and then about two
after the event,

2228
02:16:30,071 --> 02:16:35,071
I went down to talk to the cops to see 
if anybody had been hurt or anything 

2229
02:16:35,071 --> 02:16:39,121
like that.
And then on the way back into the 

2230
02:16:39,121 --> 02:16:39,550
university,
I got a cost by half a dozen,

2231
02:16:40,180 --> 02:16:45,180
like radical types and about 30 of their
hangers on and then there was a crowd of

2232
02:16:45,641 --> 02:16:48,520
people that I would say we're probably 
supporting me,

2233
02:16:48,521 --> 02:16:53,521
that that gathered around me and they 
went after me and videotaped all of it 

2234
02:16:53,521 --> 02:16:58,500
on their cell phones and then they 
posted that and the idea was that that 

2235
02:16:58,841 --> 02:17:03,841
was going to do me in.
But what happened was the comments were 

2236
02:17:03,841 --> 02:17:05,950
100 to one in favor of what I was 
saying.

2237
02:17:06,190 --> 02:17:11,190
So that was another example where the 
protests were more damaging to the 

2238
02:17:11,190 --> 02:17:15,871
protestors then they were to me.
And that's been luckily fortunately,

2239
02:17:16,240 --> 02:17:19,450
miraculously all of that,
a recurrent pattern.

2240
02:17:20,440 --> 02:17:25,440
And so the question is whether or not I 
can tolerate it and whether my family 

2241
02:17:26,231 --> 02:17:27,760
can tolerate it.
And so far,

2242
02:17:28,750 --> 02:17:33,750
look,
if you're trying to do something 

2243
02:17:33,750 --> 02:17:35,910
difficult,
let's say the right amount of 

2244
02:17:35,910 --> 02:17:35,910
controversy isn't zero.

2245
02:17:36,600 --> 02:17:41,600
The question is how much controversy can
you handle and how much of the mud 

2246
02:17:41,600 --> 02:17:45,531
that's thrown will stick.
And then how much of it deserves to 

2247
02:17:45,531 --> 02:17:45,531
stick.
All of those things,

2248
02:17:45,531 --> 02:17:47,790
you've got to scour your conscience 
under those circumstances,

2249
02:17:48,370 --> 02:17:48,690
but

2250
02:17:51,960 --> 02:17:56,960
so far I've been fortunate.
It seems like you've taken on this 

2251
02:17:57,361 --> 02:18:02,361
dragon voluntarily.
It seems like from the beginning you 

2252
02:18:02,361 --> 02:18:02,430
have known that this,
for example,

2253
02:18:02,431 --> 02:18:07,431
when you spoke up against the 
[inaudible] in Canada,

2254
02:18:08,401 --> 02:18:13,401
you knew that this might become tough.
Well Guide taught people to negotiate in

2255
02:18:15,841 --> 02:18:18,180
my clinical practice for a long time.
You know,

2256
02:18:18,181 --> 02:18:23,181
I've had lots of clients,
many of those clients were female and 

2257
02:18:23,181 --> 02:18:28,100
the are.
The goal in my consulting with them was 

2258
02:18:28,100 --> 02:18:32,061
to double or triple their salary within 
five years and so that wasn't 

2259
02:18:32,941 --> 02:18:35,490
necessarily the only goal.
We discussed all sorts of goals,

2260
02:18:35,491 --> 02:18:40,491
but that was often one and so I was very
accustomed to organizing people to 

2261
02:18:40,491 --> 02:18:42,810
negotiate and there's,
if you want to negotiate,

2262
02:18:42,811 --> 02:18:47,070
there's a couple of rules.
The first rule is you have to be able to

2263
02:18:47,071 --> 02:18:52,071
say no,
and what no means is there isn't 

2264
02:18:52,071 --> 02:18:54,330
anything you can do to me to get me to 
do that.

2265
02:18:55,020 --> 02:18:57,150
That's what no means.
No like you can be.

2266
02:18:57,180 --> 02:18:59,670
You can have different degrees of 
seriousness about no,

2267
02:18:59,671 --> 02:19:01,740
but if you're going to negotiate with 
your boss,

2268
02:19:01,741 --> 02:19:06,741
say for a substantial raise,
no means if I don't get it,

2269
02:19:07,171 --> 02:19:12,171
then I will leave.
That's fundamentally and leaving will 

2270
02:19:12,171 --> 02:19:12,420
cost you more than.
It's not a threat,

2271
02:19:12,450 --> 02:19:17,450
right?
It has to be the observation that me 

2272
02:19:17,450 --> 02:19:20,631
leaving will cost you substantially more
than giving me the race.

2273
02:19:20,880 --> 02:19:25,880
You have to be in a position to make 
that case or you don't win the 

2274
02:19:25,880 --> 02:19:29,121
negotiation.
And so I always put my clients in a 

2275
02:19:29,121 --> 02:19:29,720
where if they went and asked for 
something,

2276
02:19:30,050 --> 02:19:33,530
they were in a position to win because 
we didn't go and ask before that.

2277
02:19:34,340 --> 02:19:37,190
So when I made the video criticizing 
bill c 16,

2278
02:19:37,191 --> 02:19:41,000
I thought I'm not abiding by this damn 
piece of legislation.

2279
02:19:41,330 --> 02:19:42,440
And then I thought,
well,

2280
02:19:42,441 --> 02:19:45,770
what does it mean that I'm not?
And I thought,

2281
02:19:47,150 --> 02:19:52,150
well,
I had multiple sources of income so I 

2282
02:19:52,150 --> 02:19:54,341
was re.
I was reasonably position to tolerate a 

2283
02:19:54,341 --> 02:19:56,400
fair bit of push back.
I mean I could've got wiped out.

2284
02:19:56,401 --> 02:19:59,240
He had things gone sideways,
but it would have been difficult to take

2285
02:19:59,241 --> 02:20:02,090
me out completely.
And I thought,

2286
02:20:03,710 --> 02:20:06,890
there's no way I'm abiding by this piece
of legislation.

2287
02:20:07,210 --> 02:20:12,210
I was willing,
I thought through the negative 

2288
02:20:12,210 --> 02:20:12,800
consequences.
Now I didn't of course think that any of

2289
02:20:12,801 --> 02:20:16,460
this would happen because this is just 
completely preposterous and no one could

2290
02:20:16,461 --> 02:20:17,960
have possibly foreseen it.
But.

2291
02:20:19,070 --> 02:20:23,210
So I would say there were certain things
I faced in doing that,

2292
02:20:23,211 --> 02:20:28,211
but I couldn't have foreseen the 
absolutely explosive consequences.

2293
02:20:29,720 --> 02:20:32,000
I'm not unhappy that I did it.
I would do it again.

2294
02:20:32,540 --> 02:20:34,310
I am still doing it.
I suppose.

2295
02:20:34,880 --> 02:20:39,880
So which of your 12 rules to break?
Most of?

2296
02:20:42,250 --> 02:20:43,070
Hmm.

2297
02:20:51,980 --> 02:20:56,720
I could probably still be better at 
listening to people I like.

2298
02:20:56,721 --> 02:21:00,110
I have these.
I do interviews with people.

2299
02:21:00,111 --> 02:21:02,510
I call them discussions because they're 
not really interviews.

2300
02:21:03,310 --> 02:21:05,810
Probably they're not interviews because 
I talked too much,

2301
02:21:06,590 --> 02:21:11,590
so I had to call them discussions.
But I would say the most common 

2302
02:21:11,590 --> 02:21:13,430
criticism of those discussions is that 
I've,

2303
02:21:13,770 --> 02:21:18,770
I interrupt the people that I'm 
discussing things with and until the 

2304
02:21:19,011 --> 02:21:22,250
conversation probably a little bit more 
towards me,

2305
02:21:22,520 --> 02:21:27,520
my thinking than there is now.
Part of that I think is my natural 

2306
02:21:27,520 --> 02:21:31,310
tendency towards like I've always talked
a lot ever since I was like three,

2307
02:21:31,850 --> 02:21:35,330
like continually.
So it's,

2308
02:21:35,450 --> 02:21:37,100
I'm there,
I'm verbally fluent,

2309
02:21:37,140 --> 02:21:37,630
you know,
it's,

2310
02:21:37,670 --> 02:21:40,040
it's part of my nature and extroverted,

2311
02:21:40,930 --> 02:21:41,560
but

2312
02:21:43,660 --> 02:21:46,230
you can always get better at listening,
you know,

2313
02:21:46,810 --> 02:21:51,160
and so I can listen and I practiced that
because I'm a therapist.

2314
02:21:51,161 --> 02:21:52,510
But I would say that's probably the 
rule.

2315
02:21:52,511 --> 02:21:57,511
I break that rule nine,
like assume that the person you're 

2316
02:21:57,511 --> 02:21:59,911
listening to know something you don't.
It's like I'm not as good at that yet as

2317
02:22:00,071 --> 02:22:05,050
I could be because I wouldn't get that 
criticism if I was like,

2318
02:22:05,051 --> 02:22:08,470
it's not every comment or anything.
It's probably like every 20th comment or

2319
02:22:08,471 --> 02:22:10,000
every 30th comment,
but it's.

2320
02:22:10,360 --> 02:22:12,040
But it's still,
it's consistent.

2321
02:22:12,041 --> 02:22:13,750
And so every time I have an interview I 
think,

2322
02:22:13,751 --> 02:22:15,430
okay,
I'm going to try to shut up a little bit

2323
02:22:15,431 --> 02:22:20,431
more,
but then I get excited about what's 

2324
02:22:20,431 --> 02:22:22,300
happening and you know,
talk too much.

2325
02:22:27,520 --> 02:22:32,520
One thing related to that,
sometimes you seem to go off on a 

2326
02:22:33,691 --> 02:22:36,210
tangent.
When you're discussing something,

2327
02:22:36,240 --> 02:22:38,130
you'd go into a,
a,

2328
02:22:38,131 --> 02:22:40,230
you know,
something related to it,

2329
02:22:40,570 --> 02:22:43,770
then you come back to a greater 
structure of things.

2330
02:22:44,140 --> 02:22:45,330
Um,
do you,

2331
02:22:45,360 --> 02:22:50,360
have you laid all this out before you 
say it or do you just go from one topic 

2332
02:22:52,201 --> 02:22:57,201
to another and they somehow relate 
together and become whole and both.

2333
02:22:57,420 --> 02:22:58,200
Both.
Yeah,

2334
02:22:58,490 --> 02:23:02,230
but so before I do a talk,
like I have to,

2335
02:23:02,610 --> 02:23:04,680
I think about the talk all day before I 
do it,

2336
02:23:04,710 --> 02:23:06,870
like not 100 percent of the time,
but it's,

2337
02:23:06,890 --> 02:23:11,890
it's in my mind all the time.
And what I'm trying to get is the basic 

2338
02:23:11,890 --> 02:23:15,981
narrative and it's something like you 
can only use a metaphor to really 

2339
02:23:15,981 --> 02:23:19,461
describe it.
So imagine you wanted to cross a swamp 

2340
02:23:19,461 --> 02:23:20,310
and there were stones under the surface.

2341
02:23:21,030 --> 02:23:26,030
You need to know where the stones are to
get from one side of the swamp to the 

2342
02:23:26,030 --> 02:23:29,001
other.
And so then that's what I do in my 

2343
02:23:29,001 --> 02:23:29,001
imagination I think,
okay,

2344
02:23:29,001 --> 02:23:32,181
well there's this area I have to 
traverse and there's stepping stones 

2345
02:23:32,181 --> 02:23:34,890
along the way.
I need to know where they're located.

2346
02:23:35,580 --> 02:23:38,880
And so that might be like 12 points or 
something like that.

2347
02:23:39,180 --> 02:23:44,180
That's the rough path.
And then I have a whole corpus of 

2348
02:23:44,180 --> 02:23:48,921
stories that fit each of those points 
and then I can choose how I'm going to 

2349
02:23:50,011 --> 02:23:55,011
weave those together.
But I have to remember where I'm going 

2350
02:23:55,011 --> 02:23:55,110
and if I'm.
Well,

2351
02:23:55,320 --> 02:24:00,320
like if I'm healthy and functioning 
property then I can go way out on a 

2352
02:24:00,320 --> 02:24:02,010
tangent and I can still remember,
Oh yes,

2353
02:24:02,011 --> 02:24:05,400
I have to tie that back to this point 
and move to the next step.

2354
02:24:05,700 --> 02:24:07,350
So it's,
I like,

2355
02:24:07,380 --> 02:24:10,110
I think it's like jazz improvisation 
essentially,

2356
02:24:10,111 --> 02:24:15,111
you know,
you have the melody and it has to 

2357
02:24:15,111 --> 02:24:16,250
organize the melody has to organize all 
the improvisation.

2358
02:24:16,680 --> 02:24:19,440
And then I have all these stories that I
know,

2359
02:24:20,190 --> 02:24:25,190
but I,
every time I tell this story I try to 

2360
02:24:25,190 --> 02:24:27,060
vary it so that it brings in something I
haven't brought in before.

2361
02:24:27,061 --> 02:24:28,830
Integrate something,
you know,

2362
02:24:28,831 --> 02:24:31,050
like what are the things I was trying to
do tonight?

2363
02:24:31,530 --> 02:24:36,530
I've been trying to figure out for a 
long time is how to integrate the idea 

2364
02:24:36,530 --> 02:24:40,430
of the good player of games with the 
idea of voluntarily shouldering you're 

2365
02:24:41,490 --> 02:24:44,850
the catastrophe of life.
I know those are the same thing,

2366
02:24:45,330 --> 02:24:50,330
but it's not obvious why,
and I'm still not completely obvious to 

2367
02:24:50,330 --> 02:24:54,741
me,
but I know that the connection exists 

2368
02:24:54,741 --> 02:24:57,141
and I got a fair bit of fairways tonight
farther than I had it stacking those 

2369
02:24:57,141 --> 02:25:02,061
concepts on top of each other.
So the other thing I'm always trying to 

2370
02:25:02,061 --> 02:25:05,151
do is to take each of these sets of 
ideas and to weave them together more 

2371
02:25:05,911 --> 02:25:10,911
tightly,
but also to push them further in their 

2372
02:25:10,911 --> 02:25:10,911
development.

2373
02:25:11,100 --> 02:25:13,680
So,
and you've been doing that on this tour.

2374
02:25:13,860 --> 02:25:18,030
Have you been developing your ideas?
Go.

2375
02:25:18,031 --> 02:25:19,620
Absolutely,
absolutely.

2376
02:25:19,621 --> 02:25:24,621
There's.
You can't give an effective lecture 

2377
02:25:24,621 --> 02:25:27,080
without,
so you don't deliver a talk to an 

2378
02:25:27,641 --> 02:25:29,920
audience.
First of all,

2379
02:25:29,921 --> 02:25:34,000
it's not at talk second,
you don't deliver it.

2380
02:25:34,830 --> 02:25:35,540
Third,
it doesn't.

2381
02:25:35,570 --> 02:25:40,570
An audience like all of that's wrong.
You talk to individuals in the audience 

2382
02:25:42,250 --> 02:25:45,730
one at a time and they're representative
of the whole,

2383
02:25:45,731 --> 02:25:48,940
but you're not talking to the audience.
If you're afraid of public speaking,

2384
02:25:48,941 --> 02:25:50,470
it's because you're talking to the 
audience.

2385
02:25:50,471 --> 02:25:51,630
It's like,
forget about that.

2386
02:25:51,650 --> 02:25:53,740
You just talked to people.
You know how to do that,

2387
02:25:55,010 --> 02:26:00,010
and then you're not delivering a talk 
because then it's a canned product.

2388
02:26:01,031 --> 02:26:04,180
He muscled just hand people pieces of 
paper that they could read.

2389
02:26:04,850 --> 02:26:06,940
It's more efficient.
Why not do that?

2390
02:26:08,170 --> 02:26:13,170
What you're doing if you address people 
properly,

2391
02:26:13,271 --> 02:26:18,271
is that you involve them in the process 
of furthering exploration of important 

2392
02:26:19,361 --> 02:26:21,280
concepts and you think,
well,

2393
02:26:21,310 --> 02:26:22,120
how can you do that?

2394
02:26:22,120 --> 02:26:24,520
Because they're sitting there passively.
It's like,

2395
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:26,140
well,
you're not passive.

2396
02:26:26,970 --> 02:26:30,130
You're not verbal,
but you're not passive.

2397
02:26:30,131 --> 02:26:35,131
Like I listened,
I listened to whether or not everyone's 

2398
02:26:35,131 --> 02:26:36,070
rustling around.
If you're rustling around,

2399
02:26:36,071 --> 02:26:39,490
then I'm not balancing chaos in order to
properly.

2400
02:26:40,090 --> 02:26:43,000
You're not gripped.
If you're.

2401
02:26:43,090 --> 02:26:45,490
If I can hear noise in the audience,
it's not right.

2402
02:26:45,910 --> 02:26:50,910
I watched people one by one and I see 
sometimes they're shaking their head 

2403
02:26:50,910 --> 02:26:51,190
like this.
Sometimes they're nodding.

2404
02:26:51,340 --> 02:26:55,270
Sometimes they look confused.
If if people look confused,

2405
02:26:55,271 --> 02:26:55,660
I think,
well,

2406
02:26:55,661 --> 02:27:00,661
I haven't got that right.
I have to be watching people and seeing 

2407
02:27:00,661 --> 02:27:03,541
that they're understanding,
they're following along and that 

2408
02:27:03,541 --> 02:27:06,241
indication that they're following along 
helps me figure out if I'm in the right 

2409
02:27:06,241 --> 02:27:07,240
place,
and so there's a dynamic that goes along

2410
02:27:07,241 --> 02:27:12,241
with it and so all of that,
and that's what you're doing if you 

2411
02:27:12,241 --> 02:27:15,040
engage the audience properly,
is you shouldn't be talking about things

2412
02:27:15,041 --> 02:27:16,780
you don't know enough about to talk 
about.

2413
02:27:17,170 --> 02:27:18,880
So if you have to read your notes,
it's like,

2414
02:27:19,360 --> 02:27:21,250
sorry,
you don't know enough to talk about that

2415
02:27:21,490 --> 02:27:23,020
because you need notes.
Now.

2416
02:27:23,021 --> 02:27:24,940
Maybe when you're first starting to talk
about something,

2417
02:27:24,941 --> 02:27:27,460
you need notes,
but if you need notes,

2418
02:27:27,790 --> 02:27:32,790
you haven't prepared enough.
You should know like 10 times as much 

2419
02:27:32,790 --> 02:27:36,061
about the topic.
Then you're going to talk about in the 

2420
02:27:36,061 --> 02:27:36,061
talk.
Otherwise,

2421
02:27:36,061 --> 02:27:37,480
who the hell are you?
And so while right,

2422
02:27:37,481 --> 02:27:42,481
I mean you're.
You're supposed to be the authority so 

2423
02:27:42,481 --> 02:27:44,371
you need to know these things and so and
then knowing these things,

2424
02:27:45,311 --> 02:27:48,670
you want to stretch them further because
when you're.

2425
02:27:49,350 --> 02:27:52,270
This is a theater in a lecture.
Theater.

2426
02:27:52,510 --> 02:27:56,200
Theater is drama,
so why is it a lecture?

2427
02:27:56,201 --> 02:27:58,510
Theater?
[inaudible] lecture is drama.

2428
02:27:59,020 --> 02:28:02,890
What's the drama?
Drama delivering a talk.

2429
02:28:03,220 --> 02:28:05,720
No,
there's no drama in that.

2430
02:28:05,721 --> 02:28:10,721
A tape recorder can do that.
The drama is to engage with the ideas 

2431
02:28:10,901 --> 02:28:15,901
actively in real time and to discover 
with the audience what the consequences 

2432
02:28:17,560 --> 02:28:19,480
and that's what makes a novel great.

2433
02:28:19,480 --> 02:28:24,480
For example,
the reason that Dostoyevsky is great is 

2434
02:28:24,480 --> 02:28:24,950
because Dostoevsky did not know where he
was going when he started.

2435
02:28:25,730 --> 02:28:27,010
He had problems,
you know,

2436
02:28:27,100 --> 02:28:28,970
like crime and punishment is a great 
example.

2437
02:28:28,971 --> 02:28:31,820
He went to explore the relationship 
between crime and punishment.

2438
02:28:32,060 --> 02:28:33,590
He didn't think,
well,

2439
02:28:33,591 --> 02:28:35,240
I'm a postmodern,
neo Marxist,

2440
02:28:35,241 --> 02:28:40,241
and I have a solution to the problem of 
crime and punishment and I'm going to 

2441
02:28:40,241 --> 02:28:41,480
write a novel describing what the right 
solution is.

2442
02:28:41,840 --> 02:28:43,220
He thought,
here's a problem,

2443
02:28:43,221 --> 02:28:44,660
man.
This is a major problem.

2444
02:28:44,810 --> 02:28:49,810
I'm going to divide myself into 10 
characters and I'm going to have a war 

2445
02:28:49,810 --> 02:28:54,430
and I'm going to see what prevails and 
he takes you along on that voyage and 

2446
02:28:54,430 --> 02:28:57,170
it's what makes Dostoevsky different 
than Ayn rand,

2447
02:28:57,560 --> 02:29:02,560
for example,
because Ayn rand already knew who the 

2448
02:29:02,560 --> 02:29:05,441
good guys and the bad guys were and 
maybe she was right and maybe she 

2449
02:29:05,441 --> 02:29:05,441
wasn't.

2450
02:29:05,441 --> 02:29:08,180
Doesn't matter.
What matters is that what she did wasn't

2451
02:29:08,181 --> 02:29:11,270
literature.
It was just sophisticated propaganda,

2452
02:29:11,690 --> 02:29:12,280
you know,
like it.

2453
02:29:12,410 --> 02:29:15,740
It taps into literature upon occasion,
but,

2454
02:29:16,460 --> 02:29:19,580
but she knew where she was going.
Whereas Dusky Dostoevsky,

2455
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:25,000
he discovered it along the way and so he
takes you along on the journey and 

2456
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:27,530
that's any great artists does that takes
you along in the journey.

2457
02:29:27,770 --> 02:29:32,770
That's why it's so rare vivifying to 
encounter anything that's genuinely 

2458
02:29:32,770 --> 02:29:36,551
artistic is because you're along for the
conflict between chaos and order and 

2459
02:29:37,221 --> 02:29:41,240
that's way more interesting than having 
a talk delivered to you.

2460
02:29:41,480 --> 02:29:44,690
Is it possible that that journey might 
lead to a bad place?

2461
02:29:44,691 --> 02:29:49,691
In some cases you've spoken of Hitler 
when he was speaking to audiences and he

2462
02:29:49,851 --> 02:29:54,851
was listening to the audiences and that 
and he started to find what really 

2463
02:29:55,370 --> 02:29:58,810
engaged them and made them.
Yeah,

2464
02:29:59,180 --> 02:30:01,000
excited.
He was saying,

2465
02:30:01,250 --> 02:30:03,710
is it possible that you might get it 
wrong?

2466
02:30:05,750 --> 02:30:10,750
Oh definitely,
and it's a terrible threat to get it 

2467
02:30:10,750 --> 02:30:13,810
wrong because you know,
in rule three,

2468
02:30:13,970 --> 02:30:16,280
make friends with the people who want 
the best for you.

2469
02:30:17,420 --> 02:30:20,090
There are other rules that were 
associated with that that I didn't write

2470
02:30:20,091 --> 02:30:23,860
about.
Like make friends with people with own.

2471
02:30:24,280 --> 02:30:25,070
No.
Let's see.

2472
02:30:25,220 --> 02:30:29,840
Be Very careful with who.
Be Very careful about who you share good

2473
02:30:29,841 --> 02:30:34,841
news with.
That was one rule and another rule was 

2474
02:30:34,841 --> 02:30:38,261
be very careful about whom you share bad
news with and those are sort of 

2475
02:30:38,721 --> 02:30:40,820
hallmarks of friendship.
If you have friends,

2476
02:30:40,821 --> 02:30:45,821
you can tell good news too.
You know what it's like to tell good 

2477
02:30:45,821 --> 02:30:45,821
news to someone that you shouldn't tell.
Good news too.

2478
02:30:45,920 --> 02:30:49,520
It's like they're not happy about your 
good news.

2479
02:30:49,580 --> 02:30:52,100
There are bitter about it and then 
they'll show it in some way.

2480
02:30:52,101 --> 02:30:54,410
Maybe they'll trump your good news or 
they won't listen,

2481
02:30:54,411 --> 02:30:58,190
or they'll bring up another topic or 
they're secretly angry or whatever.

2482
02:30:58,190 --> 02:31:03,190
You walk away from sharing the good news
thinking you should have kept your damn 

2483
02:31:03,190 --> 02:31:05,120
mouth shut and that's not a good sign.
And then.

2484
02:31:05,180 --> 02:31:10,180
But some people you can tell a good news
too and they'll be happy because they 

2485
02:31:10,180 --> 02:31:13,331
have enough sense to know that life's to
catastrophe and if something good 

2486
02:31:13,331 --> 02:31:13,331
happened to you,
then hooray.

2487
02:31:13,331 --> 02:31:18,161
You know,
because and then bad news is the same 

2488
02:31:18,161 --> 02:31:21,611
thing.
It's like if you tell news to someone 

2489
02:31:21,611 --> 02:31:22,950
they need to let you suffer,
right?

2490
02:31:22,951 --> 02:31:27,951
They shouldn't make you feel better 
quick because they're upset because 

2491
02:31:27,951 --> 02:31:27,951
you're upset.
None of that.

2492
02:31:27,951 --> 02:31:28,980
They just have to take it.
And that's hard.

2493
02:31:29,490 --> 02:31:34,490
So the,
I think I forgot what the hell the 

2494
02:31:34,490 --> 02:31:38,721
question was here.
I'm getting tired so I'm losing my 

2495
02:31:38,721 --> 02:31:42,531
ability to go back where you may get it 
wrong when you're interacting with the 

2496
02:31:44,531 --> 02:31:45,480
audience.
Yes.

2497
02:31:47,160 --> 02:31:47,480
Look

2498
02:31:50,010 --> 02:31:53,070
what Hitler did was this far as I can 
tell,

2499
02:31:53,480 --> 02:31:58,480
and I've talked to politicians whose,
who've built grassroots political 

2500
02:31:58,480 --> 02:32:01,371
parties about how they did it too.
So the audience talks to you when you,

2501
02:32:02,850 --> 02:32:04,470
when you deliver,
when you,

2502
02:32:04,530 --> 02:32:08,170
when you,
when you speak publicly and they talk to

2503
02:32:08,470 --> 02:32:13,470
their emotional reactions,
and then you can learn how to say what 

2504
02:32:13,470 --> 02:32:18,231
produces a given emotional reaction,
especially if that's what you want.

2505
02:32:18,571 --> 02:32:19,380
If you want,
say,

2506
02:32:19,381 --> 02:32:21,240
control over the crowd or maybe you 
want,

2507
02:32:22,020 --> 02:32:24,810
you want to harness the anger of the 
crowd,

2508
02:32:24,811 --> 02:32:26,910
let's say,
because your own motivations.

2509
02:32:28,140 --> 02:32:31,860
What were Hitler's motivations?
Here's the psychoanalytic answer.

2510
02:32:32,820 --> 02:32:34,650
If you cannot understand the 
motivations,

2511
02:32:34,770 --> 02:32:37,470
look at the consequences and infer the 
motivation.

2512
02:32:38,490 --> 02:32:43,490
What's the consequence?
Hitler blows his brains out in a bunker 

2513
02:32:43,490 --> 02:32:44,430
under Berlin when Europe is info on 
fire.

2514
02:32:45,510 --> 02:32:49,050
What was the motivation as suicidal 
apocalypse?

2515
02:32:50,190 --> 02:32:51,210
That's the motivation.

2516
02:32:51,870 --> 02:32:54,030
How do you generate a suicidal 
apocalypse?

2517
02:32:54,260 --> 02:32:58,170
You aim at it.
How do you get the crowd to go along?

2518
02:32:58,620 --> 02:33:03,620
You speak in that manner and you watch 
for the emotional response and when you 

2519
02:33:03,620 --> 02:33:06,981
get the anger that you're after,
you facilitate it and you let your 

2520
02:33:06,981 --> 02:33:11,330
imagination dwell on that and you become
a master of that and that's what Hitler 

2521
02:33:11,491 --> 02:33:16,491
did and it wasn't like the Germans 
weren't angry and they had their 

2522
02:33:16,491 --> 02:33:18,330
reasons.
World War One was brutal.

2523
02:33:19,110 --> 02:33:23,310
They lost the Versailles treaty,
was a catastrophe in the 19 twenties.

2524
02:33:23,370 --> 02:33:28,370
Every decent hardworking German lost all
of their savings in hyperinflation and 

2525
02:33:30,511 --> 02:33:33,900
the entire country was threatened by a 
radical leftist revolution.

2526
02:33:34,740 --> 02:33:39,740
It was rough and people were not happy 
and many of them had been terribly 

2527
02:33:39,740 --> 02:33:43,851
brutalized by world war one,
so there was no shortage of anger to 

2528
02:33:43,851 --> 02:33:46,530
capitalize on and Hitler was just the 
guy annoyed as he was,

2529
02:33:46,531 --> 02:33:51,531
for example,
that he was rejected from art school 

2530
02:33:51,531 --> 02:33:52,800
three times despite despite having a 
fair bit of artistic talent.

2531
02:33:53,280 --> 02:33:58,230
He had his reasons for resentment and 
anger and hatred,

2532
02:33:58,480 --> 02:34:00,840
and that's just a tiny part of it.
Yes,

2533
02:34:00,841 --> 02:34:03,720
these things can go terribly wrong.
It depends,

2534
02:34:03,960 --> 02:34:05,910
at least in part on what you're aiming 
at.

2535
02:34:06,300 --> 02:34:09,300
People ask me what I'm aiming at and I 
would say,

2536
02:34:09,850 --> 02:34:10,770
I mean,
who knows,

2537
02:34:10,771 --> 02:34:15,771
right?
Because you don't know yourself and I 

2538
02:34:15,771 --> 02:34:16,020
don't know myself not to the final 
depths,

2539
02:34:16,650 --> 02:34:21,650
but I think what I'm aiming out,
I'm hoping is exactly what I say.

2540
02:34:23,471 --> 02:34:28,471
I'm aiming out.
I hope that what I'm aiming at is to 

2541
02:34:28,471 --> 02:34:30,040
tell people stories

2542
02:34:32,220 --> 02:34:37,220
and provide them with clinical 
intervention in information that's 

2543
02:34:37,220 --> 02:34:41,811
derived from the best literature and 
science that I know so that they can be 

2544
02:34:42,241 --> 02:34:47,241
fortified in their ability to contend 
with tragedy and malevolence and the 

2545
02:34:47,311 --> 02:34:52,311
reason that I'm doing that as far as I'm
concerned is because when I wrote my 

2546
02:34:52,311 --> 02:34:52,890
first book,
which was maps of meaning,

2547
02:34:53,430 --> 02:34:55,650
the audio version of which is out next 
week.

2548
02:34:55,651 --> 02:35:00,651
By the way,
I think it'll be easier to understand 

2549
02:35:00,651 --> 02:35:01,920
because it's red and the intonation is 
all there.

2550
02:35:02,670 --> 02:35:07,670
I concluded after studying the 
psychological dynamics of the Cold War,

2551
02:35:09,210 --> 02:35:14,210
that the only proper medication to 
tyrannical collectivism was the 

2552
02:35:16,711 --> 02:35:19,920
sovereignty of the individual and that 
as a consequence,

2553
02:35:19,950 --> 02:35:22,560
the sovereign individual needed to be 
strengthened.

2554
02:35:23,160 --> 02:35:26,850
That that was the path forward was least
harm and most potential.

2555
02:35:26,851 --> 02:35:31,851
Good.
And I think that's what I'm doing my 

2556
02:35:31,851 --> 02:35:34,050
evidence for that is that I've been 
doing it for 30 years.

2557
02:35:34,560 --> 02:35:38,640
I taught courses based on that at 
Harvard and at the University of Toronto

2558
02:35:38,910 --> 02:35:42,960
consistently.
The lectures were made into a television

2559
02:35:42,961 --> 02:35:47,961
program in Toronto that was popular.
The lectures became explosively popular 

2560
02:35:48,451 --> 02:35:51,660
online.
Everybody can see what I'm saying as far

2561
02:35:51,661 --> 02:35:55,140
as I can tell and apart from the hip 
pieces,

2562
02:35:55,290 --> 02:35:58,800
which are perhaps valid criticisms,
although I don't believe so,

2563
02:35:59,340 --> 02:36:04,340
um,
the overwhelming evidence as far as I 

2564
02:36:04,340 --> 02:36:06,000
can tell is that it's having a positive 
consequence.

2565
02:36:06,510 --> 02:36:11,510
So when I'm hoping,
and I have people watching me and 

2566
02:36:11,510 --> 02:36:14,480
criticizing me,
like friends of mine and my family 

2567
02:36:14,480 --> 02:36:17,180
trying to make sure that this all works.
And so hopefully I'm not doing something

2568
02:36:19,080 --> 02:36:21,720
that isn't good.
We'll see.

2569
02:36:22,050 --> 02:36:23,910
But yes.
Um,

2570
02:36:25,700 --> 02:36:30,700
thank you.

2571
02:36:33,030 --> 02:36:34,770
The last,
last question,

2572
02:36:35,400 --> 02:36:37,950
what did you think of the last star wars
movie?

2573
02:36:42,970 --> 02:36:45,640
I've gone,
I don't know if I saw the last star wars

2574
02:36:45,670 --> 02:36:48,700
movie,
but I saw one of the last.

2575
02:36:48,910 --> 02:36:52,600
I've probably seen three of the last 
five star wars movies I would say.

2576
02:36:52,990 --> 02:36:56,350
And I thought they were all the same 
movie as the First Star Wars movie.

2577
02:36:57,040 --> 02:36:58,290
So,
um,

2578
02:36:59,260 --> 02:37:02,650
so I haven't,
they haven't been my cup of tea,

2579
02:37:02,651 --> 02:37:06,100
let's say.
Having said that,

2580
02:37:06,101 --> 02:37:08,040
it's obvious that,
you know,

2581
02:37:08,050 --> 02:37:10,420
the superhero movies,
the star wars movies,

2582
02:37:10,421 --> 02:37:15,421
the star trek movies,
the fantastic success that marvel in 

2583
02:37:15,421 --> 02:37:17,500
particular has had their Superhero 
Pantheon.

2584
02:37:17,720 --> 02:37:20,900
Like those are the most expensive 
artifacts that people make those movies.

2585
02:37:20,901 --> 02:37:22,420
That's something to really think about.
You know,

2586
02:37:22,470 --> 02:37:24,640
people put $200,000,000
into a movie like that.

2587
02:37:24,680 --> 02:37:26,570
It's not the most expensive thing we 
make,

2588
02:37:26,571 --> 02:37:28,670
but it's bloody well up there,
I can tell you.

2589
02:37:29,030 --> 02:37:34,030
And it's pretty interesting to realize 
as well that making the special effects 

2590
02:37:34,030 --> 02:37:37,250
for those movies which,
which is a form of artificial reality,

2591
02:37:37,251 --> 02:37:42,251
let's say,
is part of what's driving computational 

2592
02:37:42,251 --> 02:37:44,801
sophistication forward because the big 
processors are being used most 

2593
02:37:44,801 --> 02:37:45,800
intensively to render reality.

2594
02:37:46,220 --> 02:37:51,220
And so whatever's happening in those 
movies is something far more significant

2595
02:37:51,651 --> 02:37:56,651
than you might think.
I think it all speaks to the 

2596
02:37:56,651 --> 02:38:01,030
unquenchable power of mythology and its 
proclivity to manifest itself in a 

2597
02:38:01,551 --> 02:38:03,980
multitude of forms and,
and,

2598
02:38:04,280 --> 02:38:09,280
and to be eternally compelling to people
and so generally that seems to be a 

2599
02:38:10,581 --> 02:38:15,581
really good thing to me.
So I mean the Harry Potter series I 

2600
02:38:15,581 --> 02:38:19,040
think is a better example than the star 
wars series because I think that I think

2601
02:38:19,610 --> 02:38:24,350
that the star wars series is a bit too 
consciously contrived.

2602
02:38:25,070 --> 02:38:28,100
Whereas the Harry Potter series is 
genuinely,

2603
02:38:28,860 --> 02:38:33,860
to my way of thinking anyways,
is a genuine intuitive production and 

2604
02:38:34,340 --> 02:38:37,070
rolling got her mythology.
She so good at that.

2605
02:38:37,071 --> 02:38:39,860
I just can't believe it.
It's just absolutely unbelievable.

2606
02:38:40,260 --> 02:38:42,050
And you think of the consequences of 
that.

2607
02:38:42,051 --> 02:38:47,051
She wrote seven books about wizards like
teenage wizards and child wizards and 

2608
02:38:48,171 --> 02:38:53,171
magical castle Trenton by giant snakes 
and portrayed the battle between good 

2609
02:38:53,271 --> 02:38:56,240
and evil on a landscape of chaos and 
order and you know,

2610
02:38:56,300 --> 02:38:56,810
sold.

2611
02:38:57,080 --> 02:39:02,080
I don't know what's her empire worth in 
terms of total financial consequences?

2612
02:39:02,411 --> 02:39:05,930
It would be.
It's in the tens of billions of dollars.

2613
02:39:05,931 --> 02:39:10,931
Certainly.
She got all these kids to read 600 page 

2614
02:39:10,931 --> 02:39:11,090
books.
They produced all these movies that were

2615
02:39:11,091 --> 02:39:14,810
fantastically expensive.
Everybody read them and went and watched

2616
02:39:14,811 --> 02:39:15,440
them.
It's like,

2617
02:39:15,590 --> 02:39:20,590
and what do you see there?
It's a dying and resurrecting hero 

2618
02:39:20,590 --> 02:39:22,460
fights is satanic,
figure and attains final victory through

2619
02:39:22,461 --> 02:39:24,290
death and resurrection.
So like,

2620
02:39:25,320 --> 02:39:27,500
you know,
and it wasn't contrived that came out of

2621
02:39:27,501 --> 02:39:32,501
the story.
And so the mythologies seeps in no 

2622
02:39:34,041 --> 02:39:35,280
matter what.
And it's,

2623
02:39:35,600 --> 02:39:40,600
I think,
and this is something I learned from 

2624
02:39:40,600 --> 02:39:42,251
you,
is that it's time for us to understand 

2625
02:39:42,251 --> 02:39:44,681
it.
We can't just live by it unconsciously 

2626
02:39:44,681 --> 02:39:48,641
anymore.
We have to understand that as well as 

2627
02:39:48,641 --> 02:39:50,270
living by it.
And that's the task of the 21st century.

2628
02:39:50,540 --> 02:39:54,320
That's what it looks like to me.
So if we understand it,

2629
02:39:54,321 --> 02:39:58,430
then maybe we can fortify ourself 
against collectivist ideology,

2630
02:39:58,431 --> 02:40:01,730
for example.
I'm hoping because that's a bad pathway.

2631
02:40:02,390 --> 02:40:07,390
So you were able to turn that question 
into very good final words somehow.

2632
02:40:07,910 --> 02:40:09,490
Good.
So thank you.

2633
02:40:09,560 --> 02:40:10,310
Thank you very much.

2634
02:40:10,890 --> 02:40:11,660
You.
